1
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,779
You must show some respect
for elderly people.

2
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,472
lt's okay to play games
once in a while,

3
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,450
but rememberthere is,
a Father above looking at you.

4
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,548
Why should you bother? All you've to do
is to sit inside this house all day.

5
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:49,487
People come to you
with offerings and gifts.

6
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,690
Here one has to go around till
two pair sandals wear off....

7
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,867
...before one can fix up an
alliance.

8
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,331
Yet when it comes to getting
commission everyone backs out.

9
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:03,565
lf the last wedding went off well
l had promised to donate a gold cross.

10
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,675
l have come to keep my promise.

11
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,869
Here is the gold cross
as l had promised.

12
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,077
Now since l have kept my
promise,

13
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,980
you must also see to that poor Kunjalima also
gets her commission for her work.

14
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:18,490
As soon as the bridegroom's
party left with the girl,

15
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,091
herfatherturns around and says
that cannot afford to pay me.

16
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,261
You must be fairto me Father.
You want the gold cross yet,

17
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,524
you are doing nothing regarding
that computer-guy's alliance that

18
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,862
...l spoke to you about. l've been
telling you about it since long.

19
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,264
Yet you pay no heed to it.

20
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:39,210
Now l am going for a good cause.
lf it works out then....

21
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,474
No let it be. l'll tell you what l will
offer afterthe work is done

22
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,820
Tickets please...
please give way.

23
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,288
Do not forget to tell me when
we reach Mooreadath, conductor.

24
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,688
l shall tell you. How many times
do you have to remind me this?

25
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,296
lt will slip your mind as you are busy.
That's why l had to remind you.

26
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,762
l have to get down at Mooreada stop,
shouldn't miss it, that's all

27
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,771
You stand there old lady,

28
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,236
you come here my girl and sit down.
- No, l don't want to.

29
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:17,576
You sit. l have to get down soon
at Mooreada. You sit.

30
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,580
Are you a student?
-Yes.

31
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,483
What are you studying for?
-For M.B.A.

32
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,715
lt is a very high level study, isn't it?

33
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,415
Where is your house?
-Near Puthanpalli.

34
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,323
Oh! So it's near Puthanpalli.
What is your name?

35
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,459
Oh! By God!
That is a Christian name, isn't it?

36
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,692
lf your name is Sheeja George,
yourfather's name should be George, isn't it?

37
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,427
No, George is my husband.

38
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,336
Oh! So you are already married.

39
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,677
ls there time to reach Mooreadath, my son.
- Still 5 to 6 more stops to go.

40
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,742
Then l might as well sit.
You get up, my girl.

41
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:56,047
Get up. l think it's the arthritis.
lf l stand for long my leg hurts.

42
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,724
Oh! why are you sticking to me
like this. Move aside.

43
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,393
Make some way.

44
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,422
Give me some lime-juice.

45
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,362
Brother, even if the lime is a little more
don't reduce on the quantity of sugar.

46
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,467
l'll keep that in mind.

47
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,503
lsn't this Mooreada bus-stop?

48
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,768
Yes, it is. By the way whom
have you come to visit?

49
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,671
Do you know of an LlC agent by
the name of Vanaja here.

50
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,938
Vanaja!! Have you heard of a
lady, called Vanaja, Kunjurametta.

51
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:26,084
She has a daughtertoo. That
girl has passed Polytechnic.

52
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,583
Might be the people staying on
rent at the house of Pushpoth.

53
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,313
Like you say, she is an
LlC agent and has a daughter.

54
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,761
This is the third time that
madam Vanaja has got an award

55
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,906
for getting one crore worth
policies.

56
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:53,677
On this occasion there is one more gift
on behalf of the LlC officer's recreation club,

57
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,815
that will be presented to her by the
President, Mr.Diwakaran.

58
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,290
l will not be surprised if Vanaja
becomes a crorepathi awardee...

59
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,928
...not three times but even thirty
times.-Why is that?

60
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,089
Anyone who meets you, will end up taking
a policy even if he has made up his mind not to.

61
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,227
Let me also live.

62
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,495
When will you be at home,
Vanaja?-Why do you ask?

63
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,935
Last time you stitched a dress
for my daughter Rani which all...

64
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,632
...her room-mates have
appreciated.

65
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,641
They have sent their sizes and
materials for stitching.

66
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:27,972
Will you stitch it forthem?

67
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,910
Of course. Why else have l got
a sewing machine back home.

68
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,380
You come down in the evening.
Now let me go.

69
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,315
l have to pick up a few incentives
from the post-office on the way.

70
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:40,458
You must appreciate her. there is
no job she does not know to do.

71
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:51,060
My God!! l was looking forthe mother of a
girl who has passed her engineering.

72
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,794
You don't look it a bit.

73
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:58,076
Are you using one of the soaps being
advertised on the T.V. for looking young.

74
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,269
l did not....

75
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,279
Recognise me. l am Kunjala.
l stay very far away.

76
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,442
lf l have to come all the way
changing buses and rickshaws...

77
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,678
...there must be a good reason for it.

78
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,085
Everybody says that Kunjala
brings good things.

79
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,160
See today l have come to see
you and you have received an...

80
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,696
...award for some orthe other
reason. That's the truth.

81
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,992
l am a little busy.

82
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,534
Oh! Your busy. l have come
regarding a marriage proposal.

83
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,830
Could she be married, l wonder!

84
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,006
Oh! LlC just wait a minute.

85
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,345
Kunjali has become old and
cannot run or walk so fast.

86
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:42,176
The boy's name is Sumesh. He
run's a beedi-shop in front of...

87
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,616
...the college your daughter was
studying at.

88
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,521
She will know. His father is in
the Gulf.

89
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,751
He gave me your address and
sent me here.

90
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,725
She has just completed her
education. First let her get a job.

91
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,923
Yes, why not. Yet there is no
harm in fixing an engagement.

92
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:58,194
Even the horoscope is not a
problem since the boy likes her.

93
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,769
They have no other demands too.

94
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,872
l have some important work now.
Auto!!!!

95
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,508
Oh! in case you don't want
Sumesh l have good proposals...

96
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,870
...in this bag here.

97
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,344
l know your house. l will come
to meet you there.

98
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:17,549
l could not get to see the girl
either. She must be beautiful.

99
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,664

00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:09,554

00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:50,121
Hello! Yes, say what is it?

144
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:59,061
Yes, she is here.
How are things in Dubai?

145
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,599
Here we are having a small
function.

146
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,963
Today, is Nabesa's daughter
Shalumol's birthday.

147
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,431
All of ourfamily members have
come together, that's all.

148
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:13,101
When are you coming home?
Yes, she is here.

149
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,507
All of you except Sukhada can
go.

150
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,317
Sulaiman is coming!

151
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,487
When?-You ask him yourself.

152
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,424
What is Dubai today! You can
call wheneveryou feel like it.

153
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,095
You can just get into an aeroplane
and come here at your own will.

154
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:35,424
My husband had gone to Dubai
on an illegal launch.

155
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,569
ln those days there was no phone.

156
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,763
Fortwo years after he left
there was no news from him.

157
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,805
Whetherthe Arab police had
caught him and put him in prison,

158
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,499
...or did he fall and die in the
sea, we had no idea.

159
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,305
We just waited for him here.

160
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,675
Aftertwo years there was a
letterfrom him.

161
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:55,343
When the master went to Dubai
he asked me many times to come

162
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,785
But l was not lucky then.
The boat did not touch the shore.

163
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,754
We only have to swim and reach
for it.

164
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,460
What work do you have here?
You never do what you are told.

165
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,291
Do l sit quiet even for a minute?

166
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,626
Didn't l ask you to fill waterfor
boiling.

167
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:13,202
The water is already kept to boil
on the stove. Why do you crib?

168
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,238
Then go to the physician and ask
him to give me some oil.

169
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,138
Which oil is it?
-Just do as you are told.

170
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,777
That's where l was going to now.

171
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,181
Oh! lt's you Girija.
When did you come?

172
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,579
lt's been some time.
-Did you meet Jameela?

173
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:32,689
Yes.- Girija works forthe
post-office. Do you know her?

174
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:33,817
l have seen her before.

175
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,494
When she came here first she
was like you.

176
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,027
Now she is a crorepathi three
times over. She is clever now.

177
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,495
The people in this house are the
reason for me becoming a ...

178
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,066
...crorepathi. Just flatterthe
elderly lady of the house.

179
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,669
Achu! Come, it's getting late.

180
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,543
Vegetables are so costly these
days. Not just the cauliflower

181
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:55,070
...even our ordinary Koorka
(underground tuber) is for Rs.20.

182
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,214
So you bought Koorka too
without my knowledge.

183
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,816
Not behind your back. When we
got down from the bus a hawker

184
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,111
...was standing by with fresh
Koorka on his hand-cart.

185
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,288
l asked him the price only after
buying it.

186
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,787
So how much of it did you buy?
-Just 2 kilos.

187
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,959
Oh! God, looks like Koorka
season has started once more.

188
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,422
l'm going to leave town and go
somewhere else. l'm tired of it.

189
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,186
l will also come with you.

190
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,094
Look brothers!!

191
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:18,225
You're a beauty and me a
good looker.

192
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:24,535
We can sit together
and celebrate Thiruonam!!...

193
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:25,209
These fellows!!...

194
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,471
Don't look. They are singing for
me, not you.

195
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,545
Oh! you pretty girl.
As if these romeos...

196
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:34,048
will pass comments on the mother
of a girl who has passed civil engineering.

197
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,244
Only you know it's your mother,
you envious girl.

198
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,389
They see us as two friends.

199
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,490
Oh! Feel good about it then.

200
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,962
Aye! Girl. -Am l not your
friend?

201
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,931
There was a registered letter in
your name, Ashwathi.

202
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,333
l signed and took it.

203
00:17:55,541 --> 00:18:01,002
Daughter Smithi there is an envelope
on the table. Just get it. -Daughter.

204
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,747
You'll weren't there here for a
week or so, isn't it?

205
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,313
Yes, we have just returned.

206
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,746
The shooting for, ''Kaneerpookal''
was at Ernakulam.

207
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,352
Now it has become easierto
give directions to the auto-driver

208
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,045
lf l tell them l stay near serial
actress Smithi's house, ...

209
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,314
...they all know.

210
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,251
lf it is an appointment order,
l want a treat.

211
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,331
lt's not an appointment order,
it's an interview call letter.

212
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,027
The interview is at Trivandrum.
There are only 4 vacancies.

213
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,331
Yet, not less than 4000 people
will come for it. l'm not going.

214
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,067
Don't do that. lt's okay if you
don't get it. But you must try.

215
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,437
You must go.

216
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,237
My dear mother, there is no use
in going.

217
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,505
Even if l do get it,

218
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,876
they will appoint me either
at Trivandrum or at Kollam district.

219
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,019
lt doesn't matter where you get it.
We are only two of us.

220
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,917
We can rent out a house like
this and stay there.

221
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,059
Aren't we free birds?
When is the interview?

222
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,625
The day aftertomorrow at 11
o'clock in the morning.

223
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,728
So we have to go tomorrow by
the evening train.

224
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,529
Do we have to go?
-Not do we, but we should.

225
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,940
Deepu, it's Ejo. l've reached
Trivandrum.

226
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,346
l'm at the railway station.

227
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,316
After coming here l got
to know there is a strike here.

228
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,249
ls there a strike today?

229
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,714
There is some important work to do.

230
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,359
l can't wait here till evening in
the name of a strike.

231
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,755
You come here and pick me up.

232
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:25,859
Now what do we do?

233
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,862
You were insisting on going for
the interview, now come, walk.

234
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,504
This is an important court
matter.

235
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:36,265
My landlord wants a certificate
stating that his mother is mad.

236
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:41,670
That's why l have come.
Just tell me if you can't come.

237
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,611
Then forget it. l'll manage.
You don't have to bother.

238
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,121
Karnataka should be considerate
towards Tamil Nadu.

239
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,385
This state can never prosper.

240
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,822
lf some criminal is
arrested in Tamilnadu,

241
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,190
they have a strike here to oppose it.

242
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,729
lf the Chief minister sneezes,
there will be strike the next day.

243
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:01,900
lf you beat up the protesters
there's a strike

244
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,759
lf you don't beat them
too there is a strike.

245
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,731
There is no chance for it to
prosper.

246
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,567
How long will this strike last?

247
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:07,902
Did you come by this train?

248
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,334
Yes.-What is the case?

249
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,135
What?
- l mean where do you have to go?

250
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,674
To Pattam. She has an interview
there, at 10 o'clock.

251
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,405
l too am going that way.
Whether Karnataka is fairto

252
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,676
Tamil-nadu or not there will be
an interview.

253
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,352
lf l manage to get a vehicle will
you share the fare 50-50.

254
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,285
But from where will you get a
vehicle. There is a strike.

255
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,322
lf l can arrange it,
is it okay with you?

256
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:33,495
Make the strike a success.
Let the opposition be defeated.

257
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:37,965
Let there be no vehicles on the
roads. Let all the shops be shut.

258
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:44,370
That is what today's strike
demands and requests of you.

259
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,810
Let Karnataka be fairto
Tamil-nadu and Tamil-nadu be...

260
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:55,750
...fairto Karnataka.
And the two states be fairto Kerala.

261
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,616
The switch is not working.

262
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:04,455
Listen my people... Let's make
today's strike a success.

263
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,860
All business establishments
please co-operate.

264
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:16,300
Stop, stop. okay you go ahead.

265
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,998
Let the government be fair.

266
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:26,675
We request you once again to
co-operate and make the strike a success.

267
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:29,877
Those who do not comply will be
made to shut-down their shops.

268
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:34,215
See there. That is the building.
lt's on the fourth floor.

269
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,656
Here keep this.
-Thank you.

270
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,998
ln a way, it's good there is a strike.

271
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,633
l guess very few people might
have come.

272
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,027
You are tense, aren't you?

273
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:48,502
Why should l be tense, when l
know that l won't get the job?

274
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,675
Don't speak inauspicious things.

275
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,942
See, no one has come due to
the strike.

276
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,512
Have you come forthe
interview?-Yes.

277
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,511
You don't have to laugh.

278
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,019
You will get an experience
of attending an interview.

279
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:07,316
That itself is a big thing.
-Yes, really big.

280
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,459
Do you have a small copper
vessel?

281
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,793
Yes, of course. lt's inside over
there. you can go in.

282
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,472
lt's very hot outside, isn't it?
-Yes..

283
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,380
lt's the month of meenam.

284
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,009
What do you want?

285
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:42,656
A lamp.-What type of lamp? A
hanging one, a big or small one.

286
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,830
What l had in mind was....

287
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,693
Yes, l know..

288
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,395
l will come afterwards.

289
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,971
l know to identify a
person who has come to buy ...

290
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,440
...something or just to get some
cool air.

291
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:05,713
What had l come here for?
Govinda, just come here.

292
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:10,977
What is it, master?

293
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,324
You were sitting at the cash
counteryesterday, isn't it?

294
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:19,259
Yes.-Why does this bill of
Rs.2800.75p have a circle around

295
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,592
...the amount, and Rs.2800
written below.

296
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:27,932
The customer did not have the
change. He had a Rs.50 note.

297
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,839
Didn't we have Rs.49.25p in
our cash-box to give?

298
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,440
They had made a purchase of
Rs.2800, master.

299
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,811
l know that 75p isn't
a big amount foryou, Govinda.

300
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:43,784
That is why l am going to take
it from your salary, because...

301
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,456
...that is a big amount for me.
That's why l had called you.

302
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,455
You can go now, There is no one
at the cash-counter.

303
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,790
He, and his generosity.

304
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:53,121
ls Poulosettan in?

305
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,492
Yes, and what about the case.

306
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,531
Will the master's wealth go to
his brother-in-laws?

307
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,567
lt won't happen that easily,
Govindeeta.

308
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,137
l, Ejo haven't studied law for
three years for nothing.

309
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:05,206
Success! The high-court has
granted a stay-order.

310
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,810
You will not have to share your
mother's property now

311
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,640
Now your brother-in-laws and
sisters will sweat.

312
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,112
You show me the order now.

313
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:17,378
So, it's true that you passed the
law exam, isn't it?

314
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,453
Then come, let's go.

315
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,960
The auto-fare from here to the
house is Rs.13.25p.

316
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,394
You must reduce it from my rent.
-You come along now.

317
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,536
l think the brother-in-laws
against whom l won the case...

318
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,334
...have come. now don't go in and
make too much of a commotion,

319
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,374
l am tired, l need some rest.

320
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,547
Okay, okay don't get irritated,
my son.

321
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,772
lf this is the way you
behave after getting a stay,

322
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,474
what will happen afteryou win
a few cases, l wonder.

323
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,746
lt's not for nothing that you
charge me Rs.1500 as rent.

324
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:54,483
What rent? When have you ever
paid me the whole rent?

325
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,854
l may not pay it on time, but
there's an accurate account of it.

326
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,690
Now it has been reduced by
Rs.13.25 as auto charges.

327
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,526
Then the travel to and fro to
Trivandrum reduced by Rs. 300.

328
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,828
Then a room like the one at
Kozhikode, and food, a meal...

329
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,461
...of fish curry and rice from
that restaurant at the mall...

330
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,402
together all add up to Rs.1200
-This is quiet high, very high.

331
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,576
Still, l'm a decent guy so l'm
not saying anything.

332
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,768
Oh! lf it's that much of a
bother, you don't stay here.

333
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,911
l shall forego the money you
owe me.

334
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,878
You can take your belongings
and go.

335
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,382
Oh! l knew you would say this.
Even though you are not keen ...

336
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:24,418
...on having me here l am very
keen on staying here.

337
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,454
Why is that so?

338
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,988
Where else will l get to see this
love, anger and miserliness?

339
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,823
lt's not there anywhere else, is
it?

340
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,027
Master, your sisters and
brother-in-laws have all come.

341
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,896
They are inciting mother against you.
You don't go in now.

342
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,002
You move aside.

343
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,841
Oh, my Lord! Let there be one
round of beatings at least today.

344
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,010
The house and grounds around it
are mother's property.

345
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,510
She can decide what she wants
to do with it.

346
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,581
That's why my husband spent
all the money and went to court.

347
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,649
For who else?
-For whom?

348
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:55,683
Foryou, mother.

349
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,219
ln any case, what does that
fellow who has no family...

350
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,516
...or children want to do with all
this wealth.

351
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,354
Anyway we never asked for all
of it. lt's our parental property.

352
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,157
Like their love, this too should
be given equally to all.

353
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:11,165
Haven't i paid you the money for
that love equally, my sister.

354
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,998
ls land costing the same today?

355
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,365
But back then the money too had
greater value.

356
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,169
When father died this property
was mortgaged twice over.

357
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:23,006
lt was l who freed it and got it
registered in mother's name.

358
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,341
Don't you rememberthat, my
brother-in-laws?

359
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,279
When you'll insisted on dividing
the property,

360
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,284
l made an overall assessment
of the value of the entire property

361
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:34,151
and gave you your share. Why is that?

362
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:38,289
So that the property is in mother's
name as long as she is alive.

363
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:39,793
When you have exhausted
what was given to you

364
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,728
and come here to divide once more,
what has already been divided,

365
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,664
then brother-in-law, l too am eating
rice like you.

366
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,929
Just because you have the money
and a lawyer in hand you cannot

367
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,631
do whateveryou like. The house
and land are still in mother's ...

368
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,777
...name and she can give it to
whomsoever she wants to.

369
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,469
l know how to go about it.

370
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,672
lt's no use saying you know it,
if you know it, show it.

371
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,874
l'll show you,
l'll show you now!!

372
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,389
My dear lawyer, today there is definitely
going to be a physical quarrel here.

373
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,150
Poulosettan is all charged up.
lf you want to see it come now.

374
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,328
You go get me a strong cup of
tea.

375
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,190
What is tea in front of a stunt.
if you want to see come now,

376
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,729
else it will all be over in no
time.

377
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,766
Let's see how long you can go
on like this.

378
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,994
Just because you have got a
stay order doesn't mean ...

379
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,001
...you've done a great thing. We'll
see you in Supreme court

380
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,230
You can see.

381
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,271
Come along. Let's go.
-Sicily, let go of me.

382
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,341
Come along, l say. Get into the
vehicle.

383
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:28,239
Even though l may be married,

384
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,539
l too have some rights and duties in this house.

385
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,910
What rights? You can say that
to one who will understand.

386
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,052
We will see you in the court,
now.

387
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:38,188
You can't have all this all by
yourself. We won't let you.

388
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,916
ls the physical fight over?

389
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,757
Thank you Lord, for answering
my prayers.

390
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:51,197
Did you ask the court to say
that l am mad?

391
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,804
Yes.-What did you say?

392
00:27:56,141 --> 00:28:00,237
Oh! My Lord, l don't want to stay alive any more.

393
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:04,374
Kunjazi, get me that poison herb.

394
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,844
l want to grind it and eat it and
die in front of him,

395
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:12,956
or at least get me a rope
to hang and die before him.

396
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,355
Now l don't want to wait here
even for a minute more.

397
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,687
l will not drink even a sip of
waterfrom here.

398
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,931
Go, don't wait any longer.

399
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:27,128
l'll show you!!!
Aye, Kunjazi, get my trunk box out.

400
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:33,176
l'll keep my head under a train,
or l'll jump into the sea, ...

401
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,472
...or l'll jump before a bus on the
road and die.

402
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:40,476
This is the word of the daughter
of Onappan of Pallikunn, Katrina.

403
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:44,086
...or else you call me
like this.

404
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,850
Listen, l'll reduce another Rs
13.25p

405
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,654
if you leave me back at the shop.
- But what about my return fare?

406
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:52,761
You come along now.

407
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:02,435
Stop, stop..... what is it mother?
Didn't get a train to lie under?

408
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,536
Anyway you are going to die,

409
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:11,239
so why not eat the fish-curry
and rice that Kunjazi has made today.

410
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,089
You go, fellow.
-Okay, let's go.

411
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:26,621
ln every house there is some or
the other problem.

412
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:32,464
All the roti's and sweet are
ready,

413
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,864
and now you are getting the chicken.

414
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,539
All the chicken l had got in the
morning were sold off,

415
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,037
so l had to get these from Coimbatore.

416
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,176
Okay, now go inside and give it
to the ladies, they are waiting.

417
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,043
Here is the chicken.

418
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,714
Ameenatha, you take care of
that chicken.

419
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:47,043
You get it here, Moosa.
-Stir it well, Sura.

420
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,812
Then you do it, my hands are
aching.

421
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:54,956
Suleman, you go out from the
kitchen, the ladies will do it.

422
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,628
lt's because Sura is in the
kitchen, that he is here.

423
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,820
You go away now.

424
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:03,194
Look at his face now, he is
blushing.

425
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,072
Suleman, have you come from
Dubai to cook in the kitchen.

426
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,870
Go outside, Jameela's parents
are waiting to go, see them off.

427
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,745
He is not leaving Sura's side
even for a minute.

428
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:18,507
That will be so, after all he is
coming home after 2 years.

429
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:22,550
Where is the wife of the fellow
who is going tomorrow? Ramla....

430
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:24,613
You don't go..

431
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:28,018
Ramla, what are you saying?
How can l not go?

432
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,488
l have to run a business in Dubai.

433
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:30,818
Are you the only one there
to run the business.

434
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,156
There is Rashid, Kader
and others are there.

435
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,492
Ramla, mother is calling you, come
-Yes, l'm coming.

436
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,569
Look at her acting smart.
That's because Suleman has come.

437
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:47,834
Then like she says you don't go
tomorrow. You can help me here.

438
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,572
There she calls me...

439
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,445
Here l am, l had gone to get the
leaves.

440
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,348
Who asked you to get the leaves?

441
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,250
You never do what is told.

442
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,358
l never sit for a minute, why do
you crib.

443
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,619
Didn't l ask you to call the Maulavi?

444
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,526
As if the Maulavi will come,
if l call him.

445
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,193
Wait l'm coming too..

446
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,392
What is this Abduka, looks like
there is a wedding here.

447
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,231
When is it not like this.

448
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,964
This is because Suleman has come from Dubai.

449
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,699
lt's not just the family
but even those who come ...

450
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,808
...and go who add to the confusion.

451
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:22,505
Where is the elder lady?

452
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,582
l don't carry her wherever l go.

453
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,479
You must understand this,

454
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:34,215
l am not her servant
but her husband is my good friend.

455
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:39,757
When he was going to Dubai by the boat,
he asked me to come many times.

456
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:42,728
But you were scared of going by
the sea launch,

457
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,196
you have told me this so many times before.

458
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,733
Just think of it as my destiny.

459
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,405
lf l had gone then who would l be?...

460
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,571
l was just going to call Maulavi.

461
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,075
Where is your daughter?
-She is with Rukhiya. - Come...

462
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:02,510
You wait there.

463
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,482
l'll throw away your camera,
or else l'll tell big mother.

464
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,320
Don't do that or she will pack
me off top Dubai.

465
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:11,620
Then stop playing and go.

466
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,087
So, you'll go to Trivandrum when
you get a job, won't you?

467
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,427
lt's not easy to get a job,
Rukhya. There are just 4 jobs...

468
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:18,863
... and 400 applicants
in the interview.

469
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,265
Anyway there is no use studying.

470
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,599
That is why l left school when l failed in 10th.

471
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,241
lt's not because you didn't write,

472
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,277
but because of Ashok-kumar
in 10th-B, and the letters....

473
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:34,109
Here happiness and sorrow are
all together.

474
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,253
When Sulieman comes,
Majid has to go.

475
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,718
When Majeed goes there then Naufal has to come.

476
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:43,087
He died after making a big super-market in Dubai.

477
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,959
There are never
enough people to look after it.

478
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,893
But there is no shortage of people,

479
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,590
your children and son-in -laws are all there.

480
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:55,637
That's not enough. After her
marriage when her husband goes

481
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,607
there my eldest son will come
home. He's been there for long.

482
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,541
You leave me.
-Wait Sura.

483
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:08,877
Aye, you Sulieman, come here.
did you meet Vanaja?

484
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,481
She has got Crorepathi thrice.

485
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,157
You make it sound like l am
getting crores.

486
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,793
You'll get it. You are very lucky.

487
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,496
What about getting her married?

488
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:24,862
We'll see to that. lf you can try
to get her a job in Dubai.

489
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:28,266
What have you studied, my girl?
-Civil

490
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,668
Then Sura's family is in that
business.

491
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,274
ls it Kaderkutty's?

492
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:35,571
Kaderkutty's elder daughter is
married to Faisal,

493
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,940
His company is Sherian builders, have you
heard of it?

494
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,582
Of course, it's the number one
company today.

495
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:43,515
Then what are you waiting for?
Call up kader now.

496
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,245
l'll speak to him myself.

497
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,928
A lot of people who have done
their B.Tech and Diploma come

498
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:01,265
..here looking for a job regularly,

499
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,439
but when it comes to working practically
many of them are no good.

500
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:08,735
l'm not saying it's my right, but
l am convinced l won't be a flop.

501
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:16,249
Since Sulieman has recommended
l won't say no to you rightaway.

502
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:21,323
l'll give you the measurements for a small
self-contained house for a middle class family.

503
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,519
Draw a plan for it.
Get it tomorrow.

504
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,035
ln all how many square feet do
you need.

505
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,596
1200ft. including the porch.
Why do you want to draw it?

506
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:12,173
lf it's a house plan even l can
try my hand at it a bit.

507
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,341
What are these two here?

508
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:20,281
These are 2 bedrooms, bath-room,
store-room, kitchen ...

509
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,953
..and a prayer room.
-Now what is the problem?

510
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,851
lt's the bedroom, it has to be of
12x14 only.

511
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:31,290
Bring this kitchen to this side &
get 2 bathrooms adjacent to each other,

512
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:34,363
then you'll get the
required space forthe bedroom.

513
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,594
Mother, have you learnt
engineering?

514
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:40,995
Oh! lt's only now that it has
come to be known as all this.

515
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,570
Previously when anyone had to
build a house,

516
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:46,300
they would call a carpenter and
strike a nail at the farther-most corner.

517
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,071
Then they would tie a rope
tightly around the measured place

518
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,477
the area inside it would be
used for construction.

519
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,652
ln those days even the labourers
who lifted bricks knew all this.

520
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,322
You do as l am telling you,
everything will be fine.

521
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,761
Have you worked anywhere else
before this?-No, sir.

522
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,965
This looks like a plan drawn by
an experienced engineer.

523
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,229
Ask Usha to come here.

524
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,497
Your performance during the
probation period will determine...

525
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:17,731
..your permanancy in the job
here.

526
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,513
This is our new recruit, Ms. Ashwathi.
She will assist you.

527
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,686
You must consider LlC as a
compulsory savings.

528
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,788
The tax coverage and risk benefits can
only be considered as additional benefits.

529
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,981
Now consider us working women.

530
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,685
lf you have a monthly salary of
Rs.10,000, What is your age?

531
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,693
My stop is here, l have to go.

532
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,458
Okay, you go. You stay at the
housing colony nearthe canal,

533
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:48,105
lsn't it. - l'll come along some
day.

534
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,410
Do you want to sit?-No, l have
to get down at the next stop.

535
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,215
What is your name?

536
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,219
Pramila-You must be a
working-woman, isn't it?

537
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,222
Yes. - Have you taken Jeevan Sulabh.
-What?

538
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:21,536
Get down.... get down quickly.
Come along girl.

539
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:33,741
Get down....
-You rascal. l'll beat you...

540
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,782
l was waiting for someone to react.

541
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,420
l have been observing him for some time now.

542
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,351
He is being indecent to women as they alight.

543
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,024
Leave me,
l did not do it on purpose.

544
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:44,092
When you get in or out of the bus,
one unknowingly gets touched and shoved.

545
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:48,324
l will not let you go.
This land has got courts and lawyers.

546
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,193
There is clear evidence
and witness too.

547
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:54,132
This is witness no.1 and 2.
Both witnesses get inside the bus.

548
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:55,498
Take the bus to the
police-station.

549
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,764
Now are you satisfied. You
please come here, sir.

550
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,533
This a small matter.

551
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:03,077
What small matter?
l have studied law forthree years.

552
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:07,308
He'll go to prison for atleast
2 years.

553
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,453
You must help me, sister. You,
as a woman have to deal with it

554
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:11,622
You tell him.

555
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:14,290
Lawyer, look here. Listen to him.
-Lady, you get in.

556
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,454
Our mothers
and sisters have to travel by this bus tomorrow.

557
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:17,889
Take the bus to the police station.

558
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,602
You get in there. Do you need to
be told separately.

559
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,567
l am not a cleaner like him. l am
the conductor.

560
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,072
Then you tie a medal round your
neck. l am not an ordinary police.

561
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,642
l'll break your bones, get in
there.

562
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:44,115
Why are you standing? Can't you
see those chairs there. Go, sit.

563
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,946
No, sir. l am in a hurry to go
home.

564
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:51,151
Then go. Can't you see him
writing the petition. You go there and sit.

565
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:52,125
l'll stand

566
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:57,160
Nowadays we
are very cordial to petitioners.

567
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,834
This is an orderfrom our
seniors. So, sit.-Okay.

568
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,006
Sir, here.

569
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,509
ls the petitioners name only K.P.
Vanaja.-Yes.

570
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:13,013
Sir, you don't register a case.
Just advise him and let him go.

571
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:17,017
Then why did you come here?
You should have gone to some advisors instead.

572
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,688
Sign here.

573
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,358
lsn't it enough if the lawyer
signs the complaint?

574
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:25,028
Sister, you don't be afraid. Just
sign it. The rest of it is my job

575
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,712
What is it child? Didn't your
mother come home?

576
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:42,879
No, uncle.

577
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,725
Did she say she would be late?
-No...

578
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:00,063
There she comes.

579
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,909
You caused the girl some worry.

580
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,577
l got a little late, Shankeretta.

581
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,250
Oh, what a day it was! There
was a small problem on the bus.

582
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,422
That fellow we saw at
Trivandrum the other day,

583
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:31,755
he is a lawyer. He made it all
into one big issue.

584
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,757
lf it was getting late, you could
have at least informed me that....

585
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,262
The roads are bad.

586
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,594
How do l know if anything were
to happen to you?

587
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,431
l told you to buy a mobile phone
the other day, you did not listen.

588
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,775
l neverthought it would get this
late, i'm sorry.

589
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,274
Whatever happens you get away
with a sorry.

590
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,950
As if you don't want any
happiness in your life ever.

591
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,947
l've been waiting since 4 o'clock,
to celebrate afteryou come home

592
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,782
You know, l got a job.

593
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,124
And still you are upset. Give me
your hand.

594
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:03,623
Don't want to, All my happiness
has disappeared.

595
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,625
Your happiness has not gone
anywhere.

596
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:10,129
Do you know what all l had
planned. The plan you corrected...

597
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,461
...was liked by the boss, and so
l got the job.

598
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:16,295
l wanted to shake your hands
and present you some flowers,

599
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:21,467
and a cake too. But see what
happened. The flowers dried up..

600
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,805
...and the cream has melted.

601
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:28,474
Let it be, we are mature women.
At least give me the hand shake.

602
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:33,988
No.- Oh! my. What anger! Then
let it be. Give half a hand.

603
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,866
Oh, Father!! Oh it was the
newspaper.

604
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,715
Here is the milk and newspaper.
Did you just get up?

605
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,042
No, l was in the kitchen.

606
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:05,552
l had made up my mind to see
you today. So l came by the first bus today.

607
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:09,055
l had come twice before & not seen you,
so my bus fare was wasted.

608
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,888
No one is here during the day.
Both of us are working.

609
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:15,725
Oh! So your daughtertoo has
got a job. Now we need to talk.

610
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,231
Without waiting for long you
ought to get her married off,...

611
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:19,402
...when you get good proposals.

612
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,730
Mother... mother...- Mother is
here. Just come out.

613
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:31,578
What! give this girl to that
video-shop fellow, Sumesh.

614
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:38,415
Let him sleep with his dreams.
l've got much better boys here.

615
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:42,922
A doctor, engineer, lawyer, you
name it. LlC you come here.

616
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,419
You don't need to give a lot of dowry,
after all you've made her an engineer.

617
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,926
l am not thinking of getting
married now.

618
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:54,096
Many say that, but in the end go
and jump in a hole.

619
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:58,931
Why, take the case of my son,
Babykutty. When he got a job,...

620
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:03,773
...suggested many girls for him,
both with money and education.

621
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,109
But he didn't want anything. Now
he has brought home a girl from

622
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:12,620
...another religion. She is a
shrew. She just can't stand me.

623
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:16,623
She even treats her motherthat
way. What else do you expect?

624
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:23,630
Leafy vegetables, brinjal... Sister
they are really fresh?

625
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:24,960
Okay, bring it.

626
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,296
You just threw away the leafy
vegetable you brought yesterday.

627
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:28,971
lt will be a help for her.

628
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,105
Please help me

629
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:32,638
Give me a bunch.

630
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,970
Take atleast two, it's for Rs.5
only.

631
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,306
Okay give me two. Here keep
this inside and get the money.

632
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:38,811
Where do you stay?

633
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:39,641
Down town area

634
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,817
Where in down town area?

635
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,818
She is the wife of Munnaswamy
the cable man. lt is not your job

636
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:48,480
Oh! l was just enquiring. You
don't pull my leg.

637
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,489
l don't have change, here is a
Rs.100 note.

638
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:51,490
Wait, l will give the change.

639
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:52,992
No, it's not necessary, l'll come
and pick it up tomorrow.

640
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:56,166
Here, take this Rs.5. You give
me that money here, where l am

641
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,495
Rs.5 is not a great deal to
speak of.

642
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:00,829
When you come tomorrow, get
the Koorka too.

643
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,165
The Koorka you made the day-
before-yesterday is still there.

644
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,001
What is your husband's job?

645
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:10,005
Dad was in the army, he died in
the last war with Pakistan.

646
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:13,183
Oh! Lord. May his soul rest in
peace.

647
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,011
Mom, it's time for me to go,
l'm going in.

648
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:19,849
l don't want to be rude, but once
your daughter gets married and

649
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,686
you will be alone. You
are still so young.

650
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:27,694
You don't say no, l'll get a good
man foryou.

651
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:31,527
For me!!-Yes, but don't tell your
daughter now.

652
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:36,104
Hey girl get me a tea, you can
be stingy with the tea-powder...

653
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,671
...but not reduce the milk.

654
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:46,041
Hey driver! Move the vehicle a
little ahead.

655
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,882
Hey driver, can't you hear me?

656
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,716
My name is not driver. lt's
Emmanuel John. Ejoe.

657
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,551
l have better work here than
remembering your name.

658
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,272
You must tell them not to behave
with me, ...

659
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:21,940
...as they do with other drivers.
l am an advocate.

660
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,413
They have come to take the
orders forthe 1/4 inch rods.

661
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,757
Do you remember me. At
Trivandrum...

662
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:29,250
What are you doing here?

663
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:34,253
That lorry... You know l am an advocate.
l've specialised in accident claims..

664
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:37,593
Here is my
card.- l already have your card.

665
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:41,931
Here keep this too. ln English
they call us ambulance-chasers.

666
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,767
That is dealing with losses
in accidents.

667
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:48,274
Helping people get compensation
from insurance companies.

668
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,276
But, nobody here has been in an
accident.

669
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,274
He is a driver of the truck that
brought the metal.

670
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:58,110
This is my hobby. The lorry
belongs to my house-owner.

671
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,449
Since l don't pay the rent regularly,
he asks me to do this job...

672
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:03,285
that is what everyone will feel
but Poulosettan is not like that.

673
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:06,963
This is just a time pass.

674
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:11,463
To go to different work-sites
with this lorry, unload metal...

675
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,295
...and sand. l like it.

676
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:16,964
Hey, driver! Take away the
vehicle.

677
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,644
So you remember what l spoke
to you.

678
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,642
Just speak to them
when you find the time.

679
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,819
Achu...-What are you doing here,
mother?

680
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,318
l had no field work today. So,
when l got some riverfish...

681
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:35,321
l thought l'll get it along, and
we could eat it together.

682
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:38,319
What is this, yourface has
tanned so much.

683
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:39,996
Are you working underthe sun all the time.

684
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:44,824
Let me wipe it. - Let it be
mom... This is sister Usha.

685
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:49,495
She is a senior engineer. This is
my mother. She got some fish...

686
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:52,174
... for me which she brought
along to eat with me.

687
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:56,676
Nice. You must draw that super-market basement
once more after lunch.

688
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,006
l'm going in
to see the boss.

689
00:46:58,248 --> 00:46:59,340
l'll meet you in
the dining hall, sister.

690
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,348
Why did you have to give her
details of the fish?

691
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:03,520
She is also a good friend,
mother.

692
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,847
Then why can't she take a
policy.-Oh, this mother!

693
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:13,359
What is this?

694
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,532
Koorka, you don't eat it, if you
don't want to.

695
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:18,360
Have you got the monopoly to
make Koorka?

696
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,369
Come, sit with us.

697
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,699
When l saw the mother and
daughter sitting together...

698
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:29,038
l thought l should not interrupt
in case you want to feed her.

699
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,713
l had seen her wipe yourface
with the sari corner.

700
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:36,716
l knew you had seen it. This
mother is out to embarrass me.

701
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:41,717
This happens when you get a
child after many years of marriage.

702
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:42,550
ls this something like
that?

703
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:46,388
No, my mother is not as mature
as her age demands.

704
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,565
See, not a single hair has grayed
on her head.

705
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:49,891
That shows lack of maturity.

706
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:53,065
She is very jealous that my hair
has not grayed. When we walk

707
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,728
-together on the road, the boys
still pass comments on me.

708
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:58,734
She doesn't like it.

709
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:01,740
We ladies always hide our age.

710
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:04,747
How long have you been married.
Let me calculate your age.

711
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:14,083
lt must be about 21 years.

712
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:17,760
Here you eat my mother's fish
curry.

713
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:20,088
Even though she is not
mature, she cooks well.

714
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:30,762
Don't ask mother about her
marriage.

715
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:38,271
Why?- She has not married.
Maybe the man she loved

716
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,940
-promised her, but did not. Or,
maybe when l was born he ...

717
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:48,785
fought with her and left. When
l was a kid, l would ask her.

718
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,789
She would just remain quiet, and
not answer me.

719
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:53,292
Then later it was no longer an
issue for us.

720
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,295
lf it is for children,
Jeevan-chaya is the best.

721
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,626
We don't have to bother after
that.

722
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:02,134
Why should l know about a man
who has given pain to mother?

723
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:08,141
l don't know anything about him.
l am my mother's daughter.

724
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:15,307
lt's only to you that l have
spoken all this. Keep it that way

725
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,653
Mother, give me one more hot
dosa.

726
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:27,988
What did you say?

727
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,338
What did you say?
Say it in Malayalam.

728
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:39,336
When we are together, we will
speak only in English.

729
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:40,510
ln that case l am going to stay
in a hostel from now onwards.

730
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:42,008
l can't bearto hearyou speak
English.

731
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,840
l am not joking. Because l don't
know to speak English ...

732
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:47,175
...l lost out on a policy worth
Rs.10 lacs today.

733
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:52,014
There is this fellow Kurup, he knows Malayalam
but he speaks only English.

734
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:57,353
A boy of about 5
or 6 was trying to help me...

735
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,359
...somehow l managed to escape
saying l'll come later.

736
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:04,364
lt should not happen again. lf l
practice regularly for a week...

737
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,536
...l will be able to speak quiet
well, l'm sure.

738
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:11,029
Not just a week, even if you try
for a yearyou will not be able...

739
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,038
...to do it, l am sure.

740
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,578
So you have already started.

741
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:38,621
Dear Achhu, we'll stick to
Malayalam.-ls it okay?

742
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:42,458
Yes, let me go and make lady's
-fingerfry.-That's better.

743
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:53,641
Oh! Don't beat me. Someone help
me.

744
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:59,305
Keep quiet. Don't underestimate
Tamil. You won't agree with this.

745
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:07,321
See what l am going to do now.
l will pourthis & burn your house down.

746
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:08,991
Then you will learn a lesson.

747
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:15,662
What are you doing? She will
die.- Let her die.

748
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:19,165
Then only will l will get peace.
What mistake have l done...

749
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:24,329
...Just because l drink a little.
Who does not drink?

750
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,669
That is the vegetable vendor's
husband, Munusamy.

751
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:29,004
Mother, you come here.

752
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:38,016
l go out in the hot sun for
work. Do you know how l suffer.

753
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:41,019
l should be pitied...
-What is all this?

754
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,852
This is a regular affair, after he
comes home drunk.

755
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,518
He has another woman, so he
wants to get rid of her.

756
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:54,534
He says that he will burn this
house, and this kid is not his.

757
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:56,532
What are you telling her in
Malayalam?

758
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:01,200
Has Tamil become so cheap?
l will also talk in Tamil.

759
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:05,871
Munusamy, leave her. lf you beat
her again, you will repent.

760
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:07,379
What will you do?

761
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:11,042
l have married her. l'll do as l
please with her.

762
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:14,553
ls it? That is not enough to
make you her husband.

763
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:17,886
You have to take care of herto
be her husband & keep her happy

764
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:22,895
lf you trouble our Malayali girl,
l will beat you. Beware!

765
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:27,062
You don't tell him anything. They
has gone to call the police.

766
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:31,070
What police? l'm not scared of
any police.

767
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,407
Who is causing all this problem
here?

768
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:43,081
Well look, who's here. What are
you doing here?

769
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,252
Do you recognise me?

770
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:49,414
l'm Mansooran Pillai, ASl...
You didn't come afterwards.

771
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:53,422
l have to speak to you about
that case. l'll come home later.

772
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:58,594
l know her well...
Stop laughing.

773
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:03,936
When did you learn Tamil. you
speak as well as the Tamilians.

774
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,607
At least you gave me credit for
that.

775
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:08,437
...if you watch all those serials
on the T.V everyday.

776
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:09,771
Any intelligent can learn it
easily.

777
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,107
But l too watch that everyday.
l never learnt it.

778
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,612
That is only for lntelligent people.

779
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:17,116
Then let the intelligent ones
start watching English movies.

780
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,819
l think l have seen you
somewhere before.

781
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,651
Where? - l'm also
an actress, l'm Smilie.

782
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:57,827
ln the serial ''Kaneer Pookal''.

783
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:05,331
You act as a prostitute in that.
What's that character's name?

784
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,834
Ancimolu! -Yes...

785
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:14,500
Did you recognise me? l am ASl
Mansooran Pillai.

786
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:18,670
ls this the House of LlC agent
Vanaja?-Yes, it is.

787
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:19,678
ls no one home then?

788
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:22,351
They must be inside. The mother
and daughter are alone.

789
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:26,852
You can ring the door bell.
-Okay, l'll do that.

790
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:28,024
There seems to be some problem.

791
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:32,684
What are you going to see,
Come, let's go in and practice.

792
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:39,866
What is it , Sir?

793
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:44,696
lt's about our case. The C.l was
bribed and he let off that fellow

794
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:51,207
But l saw him on the road and
gave him some good beatings.

795
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:56,545
He is at the hospital now, says
he can't pass urine.

796
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:00,222
l think some people are backing him.

797
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:03,551
You must come to the police
station once more.

798
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,726
You must release me from that
case, somehow.

799
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,726
When you said you had a
daughter, l thought she was...

800
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:18,898
...a kid, this is a grown woman.
So where is your husband?

801
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:21,907
Dad is in Dubai, he will come
next month.

802
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,249
Who is singing on the roads
here that too in front of...

803
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:38,917
...the house, where ladies are
living alone. l'll teach you...

804
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:43,932
lf you have any problem in future
just call me.

805
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,098
You go to hell!! Run!!

806
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:59,280
l won't let them go. l get them
to come here and apologise.

807
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:02,610
No, sir. l don't want any scene
here. -No! - No!

808
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:08,951
lf you don't want to, then it's
fine. l'm going.

809
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:14,125
Let me get that lawyer once, he
is the one responsible forthis.

810
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:18,790
Anyway, you are also to blame
forthis. Why did you sign it?

811
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,561
What could l do, if the police
and lawyer stood on either side...

812
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:22,862
...asking me to sign.

813
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,807
Ashwathi, you be here. l have
changed the site of the water-tank.

814
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:32,470
l'll give you the
blue-print of it. - Ok.

815
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,141
What will you say if the boss
calls?

816
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:40,812
l'll say you just left. You visit
the doctor on your way home.

817
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,993
No! The best thing for a migraine
would be to get some sleep.

818
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:53,332
Daughter Achu...
See here...

819
00:57:56,873 --> 00:58:00,001
Rajuka has delivered. lt's a girl.
l'm going to the hospital now,

820
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,006
Come, there's place foryou.

821
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:03,179
She was supposed to deliver
afterthe 10th as perthe doctor

822
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:06,348
No one can read the diary of the
Lord.

823
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:11,016
He gives when he pleases.
Come..- No...

824
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:13,849
l'll come during the break-time.
ln which ward is she admitted.

825
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:14,853
lt's 36 in PVS hospital

826
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:19,859
Give me some fish-curry.

827
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:29,031
When Anwar was born l had got
some fine pathiri and chicken curry,

828
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:31,036
that we shared with everyone.

829
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:32,866
Even the nurses took some.

830
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,374
Give me some Papadams.
-There are none left, son.

831
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:36,875
How come the papadams got
over?

832
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,880
You should have got some more.
They are not heavy at all.

833
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:44,542
l got as many as could fit in the
box. lf l had got it in a plastic bag...

834
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:48,053
and it had broken, you
would fire me.

835
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,728
What's all this? The doctor is
coming on his rounds now.

836
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,556
This is a hospital, not a hotel.

837
00:58:55,598 --> 00:59:00,058
That is right. Don't the people
who come to visit need to eat.

838
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:05,563
Then finish eating and get the
medicines from me later.- Ok

839
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:07,568
Come Achhu.

840
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:10,575
Your mother just left here a few
minutes back.

841
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,908
Good timing!
-lf you haven't eaten, join us.

842
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:17,086
l've just had my food. Let me
see the new arrival.

843
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:19,418
She looks like you grand-mother.

844
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,416
She speaks the truth.

845
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:40,635
Just sign on this paper. we need
to get the money.

846
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:44,472
What is this? l got them here
from the accident spot and got...

847
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,979
...her admitted. How can you
handle the case?

848
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:49,985
They are my relatives.

849
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:54,483
l gave them blood. l gave them
the money forthe injections.

850
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:56,318
l also brought medicines worth
Rs.650 forthem.

851
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:58,823
But they will decide whom they
have to give the case to.

852
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,825
This is not the first time that
you are doing this.

853
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,327
Then why didn't you get the
signature first.

854
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:03,658
Because l was a little more
compassionate.

855
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:06,164
You tell me, doctor. When a
person is injured,

856
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,166
shouldn't you help him get medical assistance
to save him first?

857
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:09,838
Don't make a commotion here.

858
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:11,666
Oh! so you too are in this.

859
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:12,670
Send this man out.

860
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:15,670
Don't push... Remember, we are
in the same profession.

861
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,181
When l'm telling the truth you
are pushing me out.

862
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:23,010
So you are a lawyer, after all.

863
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:23,844
What are you doing here?

864
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:25,850
That's what l was going to ask
you. What are you doing here?

865
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,357
This is a common occurrence in
our profession.

866
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,025
My client has been picked up by
someone else.

867
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,191
What happened, lawyer?

868
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:39,198
Same as always. l spent money
on glucose and medicines.

869
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,699
When relatives came, with them
came Suresh. He took the claim.

870
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:43,872
ln today's times one cannot
afford to be compassionate.

871
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:49,374
He had informed me of this case. l'm wondering
how l'll go & face Poulosettan....

872
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:51,547
That money was the truck's insurance.

873
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:53,716
Don't worry. God will help you.

874
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:54,712
Okay, then let him.

875
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:57,879
lf you are going to the office, l
shall drop you.

876
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:00,885
No thanks, l'll go. At least save
that petrol.

877
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:04,218
Oh! that's fine. My motto
is,''don't worry, be happy.''

878
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:06,892
Here's my card.
-l already have one.

879
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:10,554
Keep this one too. Not just for
accidents,

880
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:12,394
you can call me when you need
help of any kind.

881
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:19,071
Yourtea has gone cold.
Get me another hot tea

882
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:37,382
You are no more acting in the
serial? Did they drop you?

883
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:40,221
My role in it is over.
-ls it?

884
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:43,228
She is in the 8 o'clock song
show. Didn't you see her?

885
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:45,731
Where do l have the time to
watch serials?

886
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:50,736
When l am alone at the quarters,
ljust keep changing channels.

887
01:01:52,108 --> 01:02:03,417
Take these. On my way l saw those fellows
selling it for Rs.120, a kilo.

888
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:06,918
When l scared
them they just gave me this lot.

889
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,920
What will l do taking lt to The
quarters,

890
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:15,597
My family is in Trivandrum. lt tastes best with
red spicy curry.

891
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:19,256
One can easily eat a mound-full
of rice with it.

892
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:30,941
Achhu, that police guy has come
here again. See this. Mussels.

893
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:31,943
He says he got it on the way.

894
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:35,117
Why did you take it from him?
Give it to me, l'll deal with him.

895
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:41,621
You don't say anything. We are
two women, don't irritate him.

896
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:51,129
l don't get to see you anymore.
Have you stopped stealing now?

897
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:53,969
Yes. What are you doing here?

898
01:02:54,170 --> 01:03:00,131
l know them well. l came here to
give them some Mussels, l got.

899
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:01,970
What will l do with it?

900
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,647
Maybe you are waiting to eat
food and go.

901
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:13,648
Were you inside? l have to go
on duty at 1 o' clock today.

902
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:16,154
l'll come to eat another day.

903
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:20,819
l know that you lied to me that
yourfather was in Dubai...

904
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:22,828
You are divorced, isn't it?

905
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:34,499
Wondering how l knew? Since l
am in police, l could find out.

906
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:40,345
lf two people can't get along,
it's best to get divorced.

907
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:44,019
l too am on the look-out for a
lawyer, to seek divorce.

908
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:50,685
l can't bear her and hence don't
bring herto the quarters

909
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:55,193
Your daughter is smart. lf anybody asks you
say yourfather is in Dubai.

910
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:59,027
Some people
just try to pester.

911
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:07,036
lt's 12:30. l have to go and have
no time to even take tea.

912
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:09,711
l will come whenever l have
time.

913
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:19,384
What a pest!

914
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,230
lt's an accident. The people in
the auto are in trouble.

915
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,731
Until the police come, the
vehicles won't move.

916
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:54,589
Can l make a phone-call?

917
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:02,090
Fill in half a litre of petrol, be
lavish.

918
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:05,756
Half litre -Yes, half litre.
Put in atleast one litre.

919
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,766
Forthis vehicle it's enough. lt
gives me a good mileage.

920
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:11,769
Half a litre will last me three
days. That's why l don't sell it.

921
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:13,271
Or else, there are
so many new vehicles.

922
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:18,777
You fill it up...
Yes, it's the advocate.

923
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:23,282
Yes, l am the lawyer
Where are you calling from?

924
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:26,785
Do you know which hospital have
they been taken to?

925
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,298
What a time to have a puncture?

926
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,147
l'll leave the vehicle here.

927
01:05:56,352 --> 01:06:01,312
As usual. Why don't you sell it
and buy a car? You're a lawyer.

928
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:04,485
A lawyer needs a case more
than a car.

929
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:13,164
Ashwati, there is a visitor.

930
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:19,504
You are here. You put away that
map and come with me.

931
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:20,334
Where to?

932
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,671
l'll tell you, just come.-l'll be
free only at 5 o'clock.

933
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:29,840
l am herfriend, my name is
Emannuel John, Ejoe.

934
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,849
Don't you understand? lt is only
4 o'clock now.

935
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:36,024
The boss isn't here. l can't come.

936
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:38,853
Why fear a boss who is not
here? We should fear only God.

937
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:40,688
Come..
-Then let me ask Chechi.

938
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:48,200
Who is she? -What's it, Achu?
-Oh! lt's you. l'm taking her.

939
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:52,204
Objection overruled, come on...
-Are you mad?

940
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:02,380
Come, sit. -What is this, Ejoe?

941
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:09,384
Have whateveryou want to.

942
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:12,890
Sir... -You order.

943
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:17,228
Get a little of everything
special that you have here.

944
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:22,233
l think you are mad.
- Maybe, one doesn't know.

945
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:25,566
What is all this about? Tell me,
else l'll leave.

946
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:27,409
That accident you told me about
the other day.

947
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:31,910
Well, l am handling the case. There was
a ten year old boy in that auto.

948
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:35,413
He was a
sportsman. He has multiple fractures.

949
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:37,085
Do you know how
much he can claim?

950
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,918
l am going to present him as a
future Olympic star in Court.

951
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:44,422
Now you know the reason.

952
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:47,755
Have you got your commission
yet?-No, so what!

953
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:51,592
Do you have the money to pay
the bill, l hope?

954
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:54,929
Of course, l'm not that bad. ln
any case l have a card.

955
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:58,265
l have Rs.24000 in it. l'm sure
the bill won't exceed that.

956
01:07:58,707 --> 01:07:59,935
John, what are you all doing
here?

957
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:01,638
Why are you here?

958
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:04,442
Why, can't we be here?

959
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:08,283
Meet my friends, John Kuruvilla
and Rajiv.

960
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:13,114
Rajiv has a Toyota workshop.
John eats & sleeps. She's Aswati

961
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:17,659
Are we disturbing you?
- No problem please join us.

962
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:26,795
The master has asked you to
make more of Black with yellow shades.

963
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:30,961
Ask you masterto pay me more
for advance forthe cloth.

964
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:33,471
Where do you keep all the money you earn?

965
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:35,473
l've filled the money in trunks.
There's no one to lift it.

966
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:48,651
l have brought your enemy before
you, you may do as you please.

967
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:51,984
lf it's that policeman, you just
write a complaint and give me...

968
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:53,991
...with your signature. l'll deal
with him afterthat.

969
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:58,166
l am fed up of the first signature l made
and you want me to make another one?

970
01:08:58,367 --> 01:08:59,334
Haven't l anything betterto do?

971
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:02,500
She is very angry with you. You
understand. -Yes...

972
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:05,640
Okay, l'm going now. Remember
to call me in case you see...

973
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:08,343
...another accident on the way.
-Ok

974
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:12,342
l don't want your card. l know
the number.- Ok...

975
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:23,183
l gave that lawyer a case, so he
gave me a treat.

976
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:26,519
You don't need to prepare dinnertonight.

977
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:28,697
Why are you sitting on the bike
with anyone?

978
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:31,867
You could have come by bus.
You don't be so modern.

979
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:35,536
Why are you so angry?

980
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:38,201
The neighbours are always
prying.

981
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:39,874
Don't give them an
opportunity to talk.

982
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:42,703
This isn't the first time that l
have come on a bike with my friends.

983
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,379
You never had any
problems then. Why now?

984
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:47,712
Have you lost yourtrust in me?

985
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:53,210
See, what l've here. Some good
Chicken Schezwan from Daffodils

986
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:54,218
l don't want any.

987
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:58,883
Why, it's yourfavorite, isn't it?
You never leave it.

988
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:04,054
lt's not that, l don't like that
lawyer.

989
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:07,724
He isn't like your otherfriends,
there's more to it.

990
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:11,236
What do you mean?- l don't
think it is only friendship.

991
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,898
Then do you think he will open
the doors of love and get in.

992
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:16,577
l don't know. But l'm not very
happy.

993
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:25,413
What if it is so? lsn't he a
good person to get married to?

994
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:32,083
Just give me a sample of the
rice and chicken. l'll taste it.

995
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:35,089
Me too, me too....

996
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:38,266
Then all of you can finish it now
itself.

997
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,933
Then don't give Abduka too.

998
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:43,104
ljust want to check if it's okay,
children.

999
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:50,268
Not needed.- That is right...
-You all run away.

1000
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:51,446
What work do you have
here?

1001
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:55,515
Oh God, Call for me

1002
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:58,283
ls it tight?
-No, l don't think so.

1003
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:01,953
The old measurements won't fit
her now.

1004
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:04,625
Her husband has been
here fortwo months now.

1005
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:05,794
You go, sister.

1006
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,463
Let me see if it's okay.

1007
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:09,631
There's no need forthat.

1008
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:13,290
l'll make it loose, if you want
it so.

1009
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:17,305
Turn around aunt, l'll show it to
uncle.

1010
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:20,471
Grandma did a big mistake in
buying this camera for him.

1011
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:26,645
So you are getting new clothes
again. You are fortunate.

1012
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:29,817
Your husbands are working in
Dubai and sending you money...

1013
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:33,648
and you make new clothes from
Vanaja. How much you enjoy?

1014
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:39,817
What are you doing here? You
never do as you are told?

1015
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,827
What else should l do? l don't
sit idle even for a moment.

1016
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:44,659
Didn't l tell you to get a few
Tender coconuts.

1017
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:47,665
That is being done now.

1018
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,839
You go and see what the guests
need.

1019
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:57,842
My elder brother has come.
Rukhiya's marriage is being fixed.

1020
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:02,345
No one told me that. l'll call and
tell yourfather.

1021
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:06,179
Car has come..
That must be Mohammad Doctor.

1022
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:08,355
He is the brother-in-law of
Jameela's brother.

1023
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:12,690
Come... -Why do you want me to
come when there are guests?

1024
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:19,198
You and your daughter are a part
of this family. Come...

1025
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:23,700
l knew there would be a call
when it's time to open the vessel.

1026
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:26,875
You break the seal
fast, then only will l go.

1027
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,543
You don't pester me.

1028
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:32,710
Sometimes he just can't hear.

1029
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:39,384
Vanaja's daughter & mine studied
together at school till 10th.

1030
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:42,387
lt's always difficult for a mother
to get her elder daughter married,...

1031
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:46,550
As people would
come to know that the father has become old...

1032
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:48,726
Vanaja has no such problem.

1033
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,896
She wanted her daughterto get
a job first. Now she has got one

1034
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:58,069
lf you don't get the girls married
on time orthey have affairs ...

1035
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:02,740
The times are bad. 16 or 17 yrs
is fine. Don't make it later.

1036
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:06,406
There she comes.

1037
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:07,580
ls this the person?

1038
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:14,255
Of course! - Then l am ready.
Don't leave without fixing it up.

1039
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:20,095
l have been waiting since a long time.
- l had gone out.

1040
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:24,425
This is Sudheer. He has two
mills. -Flour mills!

1041
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:27,094
Yet he has no airs of being a
rich man.

1042
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:33,266
When he smiles you can see his
gold tooth. Look!

1043
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:36,607
Did you see?

1044
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:44,615
You wait here. Don't come in. l'll
talk to her.

1045
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,115
You be there.

1046
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:53,287
His daughter's married & is in
America. His wife is dead.

1047
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:54,621
He has no more responsibilities.

1048
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:58,792
When l told him about you he
wanted to see you.

1049
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:03,461
When your daughter is not at
home you two can talk.

1050
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:08,642
Hence l brought him. lf this
works out, you will be lucky.

1051
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:14,146
l don't want to be lucky. Tell me, if you've
anything for my daughter...

1052
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:16,484
l want herto get
married now.

1053
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:18,482
That is my responsibility.

1054
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:26,158
He also has a confectionery
business. He has liked you.

1055
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:35,495
What happened?
-You come, let's go.

1056
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,339
Didn't you tell her, l have a
Ambassador car at home.

1057
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:39,336
You come along now.

1058
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:44,371
l think of you as a friend. l can
tell you everything.

1059
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:48,209
Why do you feel so? lt's all
your illusion.

1060
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:51,214
This is not a joke. l'm serious.
Have you seen Titanic?

1061
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,719
How could l have? lt sunk before l was born.

1062
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:57,721
l mean the movie. ln that movie
Jack and Rose love each other.

1063
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:07,062
ln the end Jack keeps Rose alive
with his talk, and himself dies.

1064
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:08,732
That is the way my friend feels.

1065
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:13,066
You should definitely see that movie.
lt's a good movie.

1066
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:14,902
l'll see it whenever l have the
time. Now you go.

1067
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:16,770
l am not in positiion to go now.

1068
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:18,742
You have to come with me to a
certain place.

1069
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:20,073
Don't ask me where or why?

1070
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:23,581
What makes you think l will?
What do you think of me?

1071
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:30,758
Afriend.. lf you don't l'll fall at
yourfeet before everybody.

1072
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:39,430
Come... -Where are you taking me?

1073
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:43,100
Don't you trust me?-No, what
makes you think so?

1074
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,274
lf you are my friend you will
come with me.

1075
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:47,942
Then l am not yourfriend.

1076
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,268
Don't ditch me Ashwathi.

1077
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:52,105
Stop the suspense and tell me
about it.

1078
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:53,441
Okay l will tell.

1079
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:56,443
When two people should fall in
love is God's wish, then it is...

1080
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:58,779
...our duty as human beings to
make it happen.

1081
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:01,114
l'll tell you the rest later. My
friends are waiting for me.

1082
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:05,126
Friends...
this is Ashwathi.

1083
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:10,795
This is Nisha. She is a house
surgeon.

1084
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:14,127
Herfather is stubborn in sending herto
England for higher studies.

1085
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:15,963
What does daddy know about
ourfeelings?

1086
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:19,470
Only ourfriends can know it's
intensity.

1087
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:22,139
Santhosh and Usha can never
live without each other.

1088
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:24,312
This morning we whisked her
away from her home,

1089
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:26,140
and were planning to get their marriage
registered.

1090
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:27,474
But the registrar is not here today.

1091
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:30,480
What does the registrar care?
-Don't overdo it.

1092
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,150
Now registration will take place
only tomorrow morning at 10.00.

1093
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:36,813
Tonight Nisha will need a place to stay.

1094
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:39,493
She had planned to stay
at her Aunt's place today.

1095
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:41,822
Now you will have to take herto
your place forthe night.

1096
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:42,826
Ejoe come here.

1097
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:49,831
What do you think? My mother
and l will dance to yourtunes.

1098
01:16:50,038 --> 01:16:55,499
No. Don't tell mother about this.
No mother will agree to this.

1099
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:57,170
Nisha, come here.

1100
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:02,179
Leave your bag there. We will
get it tomorrow.

1101
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:07,855
l've spoken to Ashwathi.

1102
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:09,857
l think they should go now.

1103
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:15,391
Be brave, we will come back
tomorrow morning

1104
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:22,033
You call me on my mobile in the
evening.

1105
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:23,362
Let's go fast.

1106
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,707
Let us go.
-Ok..
