1
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:08,970
Bitch

2
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,970
Fleabag

3
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:10,800
Pig-face

4
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,800
Ass

5
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,600
Hippo

6
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,550
Elephant

7
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,390
Witch

8
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,430
Sorceress

9
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,300
Constipation

10
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,260
Loose Motion

11
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,100
Lizard

12
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,010
Chameleon

13
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:19,850
Lunatic

14
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,850
Crazy

15
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,430
Get lost

16
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,930
Those two sisters were like
India and Pakistan

17
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,890
children of the same mother

18
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,260
but thirsty for each other's blood

19
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,890
Roses are red

20
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,350
Violets are blue

21
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,600
If you like rhymes

22
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,390
I've cucumbers for you

23
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,550
Fresh cucumbers!

24
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,760
What are you looking for?

25
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,680
Lost something?

26
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,050
Or was it stolen?

27
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,800
You bumbling fool

28
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,640
looking for your smoke?

29
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Well, well, well!

30
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,760
You witch!
Have you no shame?

31
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,600
Mind your language,
I'm your older sister

32
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,800
My shoe will talk to you,
you cold-hearted bitch!

33
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,350
You wretch!

34
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,300
Out of my way!

35
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,220
Ouch!

36
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,600
Move your hands faster,
we need a tonne by sunset

37
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,010
Lazy bum

38
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,180
Bapu!

39
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
Bapu!

40
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,890
Bapu

41
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,470
What is it?

42
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,050
The war has begun

43
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,010
Where?

44
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,010
In school

45
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,050
What the hell!

46
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,300
You good-for-nothings!

47
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,600
Stop it!

48
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,890
Come home right now

49
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,890
You witches!

50
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,100
Stop it

51
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,600
That's enough!
Stop it!

52
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,760
Come home

53
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,760
Don't stop until you get home!

54
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,720
And you...

55
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,260
you are the root cause

56
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,800
Everyone clap!

57
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,470
Cat got your tongue now?

58
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,720
I'm tired of asking.
What happened back there?

59
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,350
She stole

60
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,850
Stole what?

61
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,760
Spit it out, pig-face

62
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,430
Bapu, even she stole

63
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,390
Stole what?

64
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,140
Start talking, you witch

65
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,010
Stole what, you good-for-nothings?

66
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,430
Cigarette?

67
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,350
You good-for-nothings

68
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,260
smoking at this age?

69
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,140
Smoking at this young age
will scar you for life

70
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,390
You won't be able to have kids

71
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,470
But Ramju's aunt gave birth
to a football team

72
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,680
and she's been a smoker since she was nine

73
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,720
That's why she coughs day and night

74
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,180
Look at this

75
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,010
Here

76
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,850
Look at this photo

77
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,010
Smoking causes cancer

78
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,350
It kills!

79
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,510
But Bapu...

80
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,220
you're still here,
alive and kicking

81
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,350
You witches...

82
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,100
Run

83
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,390
Wait!

84
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,220
Wait

85
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,390
I said wait

86
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,140
Wait till I get you

87
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,390
I said wait

88
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,600
Wait!

89
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,510
Patel...

90
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,260
Yes?

91
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,430
Did you see my daughters?

92
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,220
Yeah, they ran towards the lake

93
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,430
Your father looked very angry

94
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,430
Here

95
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,640
Have a Cad-bury

96
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,140
You aren't eating anything

97
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,680
Have a Cad-bury

98
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,640
Bapu will break your bones,
if you go home

99
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,300
What do you suggest?

100
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,550
Stay here tonight

101
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,760
With you?

102
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,640
Sure, you won't do anything?

103
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,720
Not at all

104
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,600
We'll sleep, that's all

105
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,850
That's it?

106
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,050
Sleep?

107
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,890
You think we're dumb?

108
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,510
Of course, not

109
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,680
Who will you sleep with

110
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,850
Me, or

111
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,010
her?

112
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,850
Or, both?

113
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,050
What happened?

114
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,470
Hey wait...

115
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,640
Listen

116
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,010
Hear me out, darling

117
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,470
Tell me

118
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,800
I will marry you

119
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,760
Happy?

120
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,220
Now will you stay?

121
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,300
In decades you haven't found a bride

122
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,890
Know why?

123
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,600
Because the whole county knows
what a pervert you are!

124
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,430
She maybe a fool but you're smart

125
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,180
Damn you!

126
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,930
You are a pervert widower and
will remain one all your life

127
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,680
I'm really scared

128
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,600
Should have thought before fighting

129
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,930
I started it?

130
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,760
Who flung the shoe first?

131
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,260
Who stole the smoke?

132
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,760
I would have readily shared it with you

133
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,800
Spare me the drama, please!

134
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,300
Welcome back, my princesses

135
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:44,350
I promised your mother
on her deathbed

136
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,350
that I would leave no stone unturned
in your upbringing

137
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,800
But I guess, I've failed

138
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,550
Now...

139
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,260
Now there's only one solution left

140
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,140
No more school from tomorrow

141
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,680
- No, Bapu
- Okay

142
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,390
Fine

143
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,550
Okay, Bapu

144
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,050
No, Bapu,
I want to study

145
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,180
I want to start a business

146
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,350
What will you do with an education?

147
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,300
I'll become a teacher

148
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,050
And start a school of my own

149
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,760
And you

150
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,720
what business will you do?

151
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,300
Bapu...

152
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,220
Milk

153
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,220
I'll start a dairy

154
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

155
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,600
Duffer!

156
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,180
Tell her to stop

157
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,390
Let's flip for it

158
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,970
Dipper...

159
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,390
Get me a stone

160
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,600
Wet...

161
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,050
means school

162
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:36,930
Dry...

163
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,300
means home

164
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,050
Dry

165
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,600
Yay! It's dry!

166
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,390
I'm so happy
the dry side is up!

167
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,800
I want to go to school, Bapu

168
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,220
I want to study

169
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,930
There's no need to cry

170
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,390
Don't cry

171
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,800
- Let go...
- Relax...

172
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,180
With time, their enmity increased

173
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,390
and with it, my source of entertainment

174
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,930
Cracker to the left
Cracker to the right

175
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,050
Boom, boom goes the cracker

176
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,260
What should I name my dairy?

177
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,430
How about Black Dairy?

178
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,180
You won't blush, will you?

179
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,220
Elbows you
Knees you too

180
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,930
Elbows you
Knees you too

181
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:09,260
Explodes in the head
Bang, bang goes the cracker

182
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,180
Cracker to the left
Cracker to the right

183
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,350
Boom, boom goes the cracker

184
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,930
boom goes the cracker

185
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,140
boom goes the cracker

186
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,550
Chutki...

187
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,850
Give me my towel back

188
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,050
Come out and take it

189
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,550
I can't step out naked!

190
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,510
Say sorry

191
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,350
In your dreams!

192
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,680
Suit yourself, my dear sister

193
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,300
Chutki!

194
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,680
Meeting daily over a brawl

195
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,890
Meeting daily over a brawl

196
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,430
Wrestling with thoughts

197
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:59,100
free-for-all

198
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,180
Dear God,
how long must I suffer this witch?

199
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,470
Help me find a man before she finds one

200
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,140
Oh God, please spare me from this bitch

201
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,510
I can't wait to grow up and get married

202
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,760
Cracker to the left
Cracker to the right

203
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,930
Boom, boom goes the cracker

204
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,260
Boom goes the cracker

205
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,260
Boom, boom goes the cracker

206
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,800
Ballu...

207
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,350
Come Ballu...

208
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,140
Hurry up

209
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,510
It's a rare sight today

210
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,970
What a view

211
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,050
But she's not to be seen

212
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,680
Who?

213
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,430
The hot one

214
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,050
my darling Champa Kumari

215
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,140
Wonder where she is

216
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,550
Right behind you,
you pervert

217
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,470
You dipshit

218
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,300
Who's that?

219
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,260
Where do you think you're going?

220
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,600
Stop!

221
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:22,640
I keep my hubby hidden in purdah

222
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,970
Your hubby roams the streets naked

223
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,550
It seems you've stolen
more than you need

224
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:36,640
Who are you?

225
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,970
A man

226
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,010
Why are your eyes popping out then?

227
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,260
Never seen a girl before?

228
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,640
Of course, I have

229
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,640
but none as gritty and spiteful as you

230
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,300
Bloody son of a...

231
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,970
I'll slap you so hard,
you'll land in the neighbouring state, get it?

232
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,720
Got it

233
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,180
But now, let go of the hay...

234
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,050
and start walking

235
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,220
Sure, I'll walk away, jackass

236
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,100
but the hay goes with me

237
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,100
Stop me if you can

238
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,550
Is that so?

239
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,600
I'll chop off your head and
sow it in the field

240
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,350
Next year, little heads in your likeness
will sway in the wind

241
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,260
Take it easy... I was kidding

242
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,930
This isn't even my field,
take what you want

243
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,470
But move the sickle away, please

244
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,010
Please

245
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,180
How could you?

246
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,260
I could have easily been hurt

247
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,140
Listen

248
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,600
I'll help you with the hay,
it looks heavy

249
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,100
Here we go

250
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,720
Bapu...

251
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,390
I'm not your Bapu, I'm Vishnu

252
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,350
Let go of me

253
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,970
Got you!

254
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,970
and you will now do as I say

255
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:51,850
What?

256
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,050
Sing a song

257
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,720
And if I don't?

258
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,220
Then I'll ride you like this until sunrise

259
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,600
Let me go

260
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,050
Sing

261
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,800
There’s your hubby, here’s mine

262
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,430
Go on

263
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,050
Yours a scoundrel,
mine an angel

264
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,970
Go

265
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,640
You're free

266
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,760
You forgot the hay

267
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,970
It's my friend's field

268
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,350
Listen

269
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,800
Hold on

270
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:40,930
Listen...

271
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,140
Take this

272
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,430
Sorry...

273
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,760
Here

274
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,720
When will I see you again?

275
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:51,850
Never

276
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,470
It's the village fair next week

277
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,180
Want to come?

278
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,050
I will wait for you, darling!

279
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
No, Bapu...

280
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,010
This paltry amount won't help anymore

281
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,640
There's a new forest officer now

282
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,510
and he is demanding 400,000

283
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,010
No more, no less

284
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,510
A bribe of 400,000?

285
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,550
But you'll get a five-year contract

286
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,220
imagine what you'll earn by then?

287
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,600
A cool 1,000,000!

288
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,680
That is a profit of 600,000

289
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,430
But...

290
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,510
so much at one go?

291
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,510
You figure it out

292
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,260
You have a month

293
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,850
Either you pay up in 30 days
or leave the quarry

294
00:23:58,930 --> 00:23:59,760
Give me a minute

295
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,220
Is there another way?

296
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,930
Of course there is

297
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,100
There, standing in person

298
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,010
Marry one of your daughters to him

299
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,260
and solve this problem forever

300
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,390
My daughters are my world!

301
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,760
They are not cattle that

302
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,140
I can hand over to that pervert widower

303
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,680
Your quarry, your daughters,
your choice

304
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,930
Sir, when can I except to get the loan?

305
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,180
Look, amounts over 100,000
get processed by the head office

306
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,930
They will send a team
to value your property

307
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,800
they'll go back...

308
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,220
Say about three to four weeks

309
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,760
Okay?

310
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,890
Okay, sir

311
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:22,350
With sarees from Chandni Chowk,
you'll look like a Cadillac, my love

312
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,430
Sisters and mothers,
final chance

313
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,180
A slip free with every saree

314
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,550
Special discount for unmarried girls,
a slip free with every saree

315
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,300
- Ask him
- You ask him

316
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,550
No, you ask

317
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,220
Sister, how can I help you?

318
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:44,850
How much for that one?

319
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:47,930
Which one?

320
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,430
The red one

321
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,220
300 rupees

322
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,010
Oh God! What's so special about it?

323
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,510
It's imported

324
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,350
Your husband will surely like it

325
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,050
It will fit you perfectly

326
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,220
Don't just take my word, try it on

327
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,300
Should I get it for you?

328
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,260
You shameless jerk!

329
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,680
How dare you say such disgusting things
and wink at me?

330
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,390
You jackass!

331
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,800
What happened?

332
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,010
He's winking at us

333
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,720
What's wrong?

334
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,140
What happened, Dipper?

335
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,680
He was winking at me

336
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,010
No, in fact he's called Dipper because

337
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,220
his blinking is involuntary

338
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,260
He has a heart of gold

339
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,100
Come on, let's go

340
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,260
If it weren't for you,
they would have killed me

341
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,970
May God bless you
with an amazing boyfriend

342
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,600
Thank you

343
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,930
He already has

344
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,890
My English teacher
from Indian Army, Vishnu

345
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,760
Hi, Dipper

346
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,930
Genda keeps talking about you

347
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,720
Nice to meet you

348
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,390
Good shop

349
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,850
He looks like a papaya

350
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,470
Check that guy out on the left

351
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,930
On the left

352
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,600
He's a squished banana

353
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,050
Now who's that?

354
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,050
Your future brother-in-law

355
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,970
Indeed, Chutki's boyfriend is a soldier

356
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,140
Yes!

357
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,390
Once he's done with his training,
he'll marry her and take her to the city

358
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,300
get her educated
and make her a teacher

359
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,100
What about your dairy now?

360
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,300
Down the drain it goes

361
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,390
Lord have mercy

362
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,010
Sorry

363
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,390
Excuse me, do you have a match box?

364
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:38,550
Wait

365
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,640
Don't get scared,
I won't do anything

366
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,640
What are you scared of?

367
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,050
Move

368
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,600
Don't run,
I won't beat you up

369
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,800
Don't get scared

370
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,760
Wait, what are you scared of?

371
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,180
Oh, my foot!

372
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,470
Oh God!

373
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,010
What happened?

374
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,100
I don't know

375
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,600
You've twisted your ankle

376
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,220
So, straighten it

377
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,430
I'm not a doctor

378
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Then what are you?

379
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:36,970
Engineer

380
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,640
Junior Engineer

381
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:48,850
What's your name?

382
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,010
Jagan

383
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,260
How's it?

384
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,100
It's a good name

385
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,140
I meant your foot

386
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,350
Cucumber

387
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,050
Lady finger

388
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:48,140
Once you try the lady finger dish I make

389
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,300
You'll commit sui... suicide!

390
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,510
- Really?
- Sure

391
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,930
I'd rather kill someone than
eat lady fingers

392
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,680
It says here that I'll kill someone

393
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,550
Sweet gold ring

394
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,100
Miss Marigold

395
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,930
Keep it away from me!

396
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,100
Take it away!

397
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,850
I will throw up

398
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,510
What's wrong, darling?

399
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,100
It's only milk

400
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,850
Darling, milk reminds me of a wretch

401
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,720
Who?

402
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,890
What do you call a female dog in English?

403
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,930
Cheers!

404
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:01,680
What is it?

405
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,510
This reminds me of a childhood dream

406
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,890
What's that?

407
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,350
Someday I would like to
own a dairy

408
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,550
sell milk, cheese, butter

409
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,260
But dreams don't come true, do they?

410
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:24,930
No...

411
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:32,010
If someone kisses your eyes
then those dreams come true

412
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,760
You're so cheesy

413
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,100
Bapu, a letter

414
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:54,720
After due consideration of your application,
the Rajasthan Co-operative Bank

415
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,350
regrets to inform you
that your loan application has been rejected

416
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,390
I'm down to my last resort

417
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,680
I'll go and ask your uncle's help

418
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,680
Take care of the house

419
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,390
I'll be gone for a week

420
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,010
You better not fight

421
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,180
One

422
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,720
two

423
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,350
and three!

424
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,390
Uncle Chaubey

425
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,970
Jagan

426
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,100
How's it going?

427
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,260
It's been ages

428
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,260
Your wife?

429
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,800
soon to-be

430
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,850
Have you passed grade six?

431
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,720
Then you have to
live here for a year

432
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:39,050
You'll have to become a member
of the co-operative society first

433
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,350
and then buy a special breed of cows

434
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,390
The Red Sindhi cow

435
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:46,600
Buy the cows and
I'll take care of the rest

436
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,640
How much does a cow cost?

437
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,180
200,000 rupees

438
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:57,640
Okay

439
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,720
Let's go

440
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,140
200,000?

441
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,890
It's okay

442
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,510
200,000?

443
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,180
Where do we get it from?

444
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,720
Not where, but when.
That's the question to ask

445
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,350
Ask

446
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:16,640
When?

447
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,470
After our marriage

448
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:22,300
My grandpa set-up a trust for me
as a wedding gift

449
00:35:53,180 --> 00:36:00,100
Trump said,
"But if I get elected President

450
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,510
we will make Ameri--"

451
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,600
Wow!

452
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,720
Sorry

453
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,430
Here

454
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,680
Very good

455
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,470
Eat this

456
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,720
Village ass, foreign sass

457
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,470
Here comes the village hag

458
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,680
from every angle worse than a drag

459
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,680
I've cut my own hair

460
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,970
not your father's fortune

461
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,600
And did I steal your mom's bra?

462
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,470
Mom must be in heaven,
crying over your exploits

463
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,010
You're still here,
so feast on these!

464
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,140
Shameless!

465
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,260
Come here

466
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,260
Witch can't even cover herself up

467
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,510
Regular 100, Recliner 150...

468
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,390
Will Salman Khan take his pants off
in this movie?

469
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,800
You bumbling fool!
At a night show?

470
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,350
I see

471
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:19,890
This is Chutki's--

472
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,550
How much for recliners?

473
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,140
I don't want your money

474
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,890
What I want is a photo

475
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,180
with my brother-in-law

476
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:33,760
Dipper!

477
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,140
Future brother-in-law

478
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,180
How about a selfie

479
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,890
Badku, you stand in the middle

480
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,510
with Salman Khan behind us

481
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,390
The more you see it,
the more you'll hurt

482
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,010
That's enough

483
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,470
Throw this in the trash

484
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,850
Unbelievable!

485
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,600
Wait, you coward!

486
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,640
Witch!

487
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,800
Hey, you!

488
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,930
Get up

489
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:24,300
What do you think you're doing?

490
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,350
- I'll help--
- You get lost!

491
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:39,140
You're coming home, now!

492
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,430
What should I do with you two?

493
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,300
I have a million things to deal with

494
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,930
First the bank rejected my loan

495
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,260
then uncle refused to help

496
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,390
and here you two are at war

497
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,720
She stole my clothes

498
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:02,800
Your clothes?

499
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,930
From where?

500
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,550
Bapu, gift from a guy

501
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,550
She's having an affair

502
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:15,600
And what about you?

503
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:18,510
You look ridiculous...
Why did you cut your hair?

504
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,010
Both of you are getting out of hand...

505
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,010
I'll have to
get you married off

506
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,300
One of you will get married next month

507
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,350
Prepare yourselves

508
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:02,970
No, Patel, that's too much

509
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:05,100
Oh it's nothing

510
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,260
I'll forget my way home

511
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,180
Then stay here tonight

512
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,470
This is as good as your home

513
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:16,970
Right?

514
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:24,930
Here you go

515
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,100
Throw it at that forest officer's face

516
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:36,300
No, no

517
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,470
Don't count

518
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,470
I think it's more

519
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,930
And I say it's less

520
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:50,300
No amount is good enough
to marry your precious daughters

521
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:53,260
Bapu...

522
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,390
Badki or Chutki?

523
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,680
I can't tell

524
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:15,930
I love both equally

525
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,100
And I too

526
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:22,140
Bapu, I have an idea

527
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,180
Let's flip for it

528
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,350
I can't find a coin,
let's use a note

529
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,680
Wet means...

530
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:41,890
Badki

531
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,220
And dry, Chutki

532
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,430
No...

533
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,890
Not tonight

534
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,720
Bapu, take care

535
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:00,850
Dipper

536
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,350
Tell me something

537
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:08,970
why do my daughters
hate each other so much?

538
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:16,350
Why are they at war constantly?

539
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,220
The same reason why
India and Pakistan are always at war

540
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,220
What?

541
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,390
A load of crap!

542
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:33,510
It's been more than 70 years

543
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,600
yet they find new reasons to fight

544
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:41,350
The firing and shelling at the border never stops

545
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,470
Bapu has disappeared?

546
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,140
Bapu

547
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,680
What's this?

548
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:13,680
Advance

549
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,890
Advance for?

550
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:16,720
The future Mrs. Patel

551
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,930
The elder one
always gets married first

552
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,890
How convenient!
You use me when necessary...

553
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,390
otherwise you walk all over me?

554
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,390
Of course!

555
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,220
Well, that's the tradition

556
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:43,260
One slap and you'll forget all traditions

557
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,760
Bring it on!

558
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,890
With pleasure

559
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,800
- I know you have a major crush on Patel
- Yeah, I do

560
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,970
Everything you've ever done
has been to lure Patel...

561
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:53,680
you dropped out of school,
your silly haircut

562
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:55,180
Don't pin it on me

563
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,680
I've seen you do stuff
to grab his attention

564
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,760
But now he'll have eyes only for you!

565
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:02,850
Here

566
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,850
Take these knives

567
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,430
Kill me right here, right now

568
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:17,550
What's the matter?

569
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,220
Listen carefully

570
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,890
Either there is a marriage or a funeral

571
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:31,300
We will flip for this later

572
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,430
Wet side?

573
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,300
Either

574
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:22,470
If wet, then Badki

575
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,390
Good morning, Mrs. Patel

576
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,720
Go on, laugh at my misery

577
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,050
After all, I am fortune's fool

578
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,010
You know you can make a call

579
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,050
Call who?

580
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:29,800
Your boyfriend

581
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:34,600
And tell him what?

582
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,600
Duh!

583
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,600
Ask him

584
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,640
if he truly loves you,
he should take you away

585
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,970
If I elope,
Bapu will commit suicide

586
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,010
Bapu...

587
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,720
Higher

588
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,720
I'll rather not say it

589
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,760
What's done is done

590
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,470
What do you mean?

591
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:05,760
Well, I could be mistaken

592
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,800
About what?

593
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,970
I thought the dry side was up

594
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,050
but somehow it changed

595
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:27,600
It's said the younger child is
the apple of the parents' eyes

596
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,800
And your father proved it

597
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:37,930
I'll post this on Facebook,
it'll go viral in no time

598
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:41,430
Viral?! Bapu will give me an aspirin and
get me married

599
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,800
Not that viral

600
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,010
Fine, let's file a police report

601
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,600
No, I don't want to do that

602
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:51,930
Tell me how much do you love me?

603
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,720
More than all the stars in the sky

604
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:57,850
that much

605
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:04,010
More than all the mobile phones in the world

606
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:05,010
that much

607
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:06,720
And you?

608
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,720
More than all the buffaloes in the world

609
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,390
that much

610
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,300
More than all the milk in the world

611
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:17,100
that much

612
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:44,100
There's your hubby,
here's mine

613
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,890
There's your hubby, here's mine

614
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:54,470
Yours a scoundrel,
mine an angel

615
00:52:54,470 --> 00:53:03,640
I keep mine hidden in purdah
Yours roams the streets naked

616
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:08,600
There's your hubby,
here's mine

617
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,890
Yours a scoundrel,

618
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:10,930
What?

619
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,050
Numbskull!

620
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:22,140
Mine eats daal-baati soaked in ghee
Yours wanders hungry in the fields

621
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:26,760
There's your hubby, here's mine

622
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:32,140
Yours a scoundrel,
mine an angel

623
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:49,600
Yours a petty thief
Mine steals the heart

624
00:53:52,470 --> 00:54:01,430
Yours a petty thief
Mine steals the heart

625
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:06,600
Yours flirts with his sis-in-law
Dancing to her tunes

626
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:12,970
With a plate full of offerings,
begs of Kali

627
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:17,390
The world’s greatest liar

628
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:22,220
There's your hubby,
here's mine

629
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:27,350
Yours a scoundrel,
mine an angel

630
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,720
Let me show you the moves

631
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,970
Wow Mrs. Patel!

632
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:59,010
My hubby a Banarsi paan
Yours the moon on a new-moon night

633
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:10,470
My hubby a Banarsi paan
Yours the moon on a new-moon night

634
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:15,550
Yours a total fraud
A rolling stone

635
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:20,180
Cockeyed to boot
I thumb my nose at him

636
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,600
Shifting loyalties every moment

637
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:31,350
There's your hubby,
here's mine

638
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:35,890
Yours a scoundrel,
mine an angel

639
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:45,010
I keep mine hidden in purdah
Yours roams the streets naked

640
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:49,550
There's your hubby,
here's mine

641
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:54,970
Yours a scoundrel,
mine an angel

642
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,140
You left that milk glass?

643
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,640
Yes

644
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:35,600
I was going to feed the dogs
but then, why not you

645
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,850
The dogs will have a feast from tomorrow

646
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,350
As I won't be here

647
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,640
Here, I'll give you a hand

648
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:56,720
So much love?
Are you serious?

649
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,720
No, I'm kidding

650
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,510
Are you alright?

651
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:07,600
Why?

652
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,100
You're talking nonsense

653
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,680
Forgive me if I ever hurt you

654
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:25,220
Look after yourself

655
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,600
Badku

656
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,430
Hurry up

657
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,760
Let's go

658
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:47,430
Wake up Badki,
get dressed

659
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,640
Badki

660
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,350
Bapu!

661
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,350
Bapu

662
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,510
- Relax, Bapu...
- Forgive me, Patel

663
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:24,300
Not at all, there's nothing to forgive

664
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,850
Sit down

665
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,350
Someone get water

666
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:35,550
- Not for me
- It's for me

667
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,100
In fact, I'm embarrassed

668
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:44,720
you've done so much for your girls

669
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,220
You let them do as they wanted

670
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:51,640
You didn't marry again

671
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,510
The entire village knows
of your sacrifice

672
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:58,430
No one deserves a daughter like Badki

673
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:01,800
What now, Patel?

674
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:04,550
A wedding

675
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,640
as it was meant to be

676
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,300
The toss sealed Badki's fate

677
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,970
so I kept mum

678
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,850
In fact, I wanted to marry Chutki

679
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,720
Huh?

680
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,260
Genda...

681
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,550
Tell me if you object

682
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:34,100
There's a world of a difference

683
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:36,430
between Badki and Chutki

684
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,390
Badki's heart is

685
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,010
cold as iron!

686
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,300
Whereas Chutki's is

687
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:47,300
24 carat gold!

688
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:48,930
Bapu

689
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,550
Listen

690
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:53,550
I'm willing to marry Chutki

691
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,640
And I'm certain that

692
01:00:56,430 --> 01:01:00,050
she won't betray you like Badki

693
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,510
She dare not even speak
in your presence

694
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:07,600
Now that's true respect

695
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:10,600
And that's an ideal daughter

696
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:12,720
The perfect daughter!

697
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:28,850
Don't be stingy with the cashews

698
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,350
You knew, right?

699
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,220
Mrs. Patel

700
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:37,180
What are you talking about?

701
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,800
That the witch would run away

702
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:41,680
And how would I know that?

703
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:44,300
She couldn't have done it herself

704
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:45,050
You're lying

705
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:48,970
I swear on Bapu

706
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:52,850
It won't matter to you if Bapu dies

707
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,510
Swear on me

708
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:55,140
I swear on you

709
01:01:57,390 --> 01:01:58,390
Good!

710
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,300
Now you will be responsible for my death!

711
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:04,260
I'd rather kill myself than marry that pervert

712
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:06,430
"I'll kill myself"

713
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:53,220
We need some more lights here

714
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:58,430
Leave the chair,
the groom is on his way

715
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:18,220
What are you doing?

716
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,600
Have you lost it? Stop it!

717
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,350
Why should I?

718
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,760
Because the roof is weak
and you are fat

719
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,550
You'll only end up with broken bones

720
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:31,010
Liar!

721
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,350
Fine! Give it a try

722
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,640
Go on

723
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,680
You're heavy as a rhino!

724
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:51,850
I told you, you buffalo!

725
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,180
Are you going to limp at your wedding?

726
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,470
There won't be a wedding

727
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:01,100
Are you sure?

728
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,260
Sure

729
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:04,550
Not even with him?

730
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:08,850
Marigold...

731
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:10,970
Darling...

732
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:20,640
Run with me

733
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:22,050
No, darling

734
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,760
Wrong!

735
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:25,350
Let us run away

736
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:28,550
Hey, President Trump!
Correct her English later

737
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,390
Now scram!

738
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:30,720
Yes, you're right

739
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,760
Chutki?

740
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,680
Chutki?

741
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:46,260
Open the door

742
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,180
Bapu...

743
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:07,220
Chutki...

744
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:10,100
Are you okay?
Open the door

745
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,300
Chutki?

746
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,350
Chutki, open the door

747
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:30,430
Not her too!

748
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,680
She must be nearby.
Someone go after her

749
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,850
Drop the act, Bapu

750
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,800
Or I'll shove this sword
down your throat!

751
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:49,640
I have nothing to do with this

752
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,890
Explain it to the village council

753
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:02,100
I'll make your life a living hell

754
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:04,890
if it's the last thing I do!

755
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:10,220
Hell!

756
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:21,350
Let's go back

757
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:24,100
The wedding's over!
Switch the lights off

758
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:27,600
You were paid to perform

759
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,470
Start playing

760
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:51,430
Grandma!

761
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:52,930
Vishnu!

762
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,140
When did you get back?

763
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:56,260
Just now

764
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:57,550
How are you?

765
01:06:58,350 --> 01:06:59,140
Who is this?

766
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,600
First, give us your blessings

767
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:04,930
Alright, but who is she?

768
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,680
She's your daughter-in-law

769
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:10,930
You keep pestering me to get married

770
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,350
I got married last night

771
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,100
You as well?

772
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,640
As in?

773
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:20,800
Badku... come out

774
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,550
Look at what has happened!

775
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,510
Your brother also got married

776
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:34,140
You too?

777
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,470
- You didn't tell me
- Neither did you

778
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:39,300
I'll get sweets for you

779
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,970
Where's your wife from?

780
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,640
Uriya

781
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,970
She's also from Uriya

782
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:45,470
Where in Uriya?

783
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,720
Behind the water tank

784
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:49,640
My wife's house is also there

785
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:50,550
Which house?

786
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:52,390
The blue one

787
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:53,800
Even her house is blue

788
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:56,140
- Father's name?
- Shanti

789
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:57,930
Shanti Bhushan?

790
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:12,140
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee
met Pervez Musharraf in Agra

791
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:14,550
he said, "The bottomline is...

792
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:19,680
we can choose our enemies
but not our neighbours...

793
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:25,050
we can choose our relations
but not our relatives."

794
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,330
I've been cheated

795
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:45,000
Taken for a ride

796
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:48,330
Bapu has betrayed me

797
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,910
He took my money...

798
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,660
and helped his daughters elope

799
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,410
I spared no expense

800
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:58,040
cocktail party, lavish dinner

801
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,250
music, decoration, the works

802
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,250
I demand justice

803
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:06,040
right here right now,
in front of the whole village

804
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,410
Justice has been served

805
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:10,540
The couples are adults

806
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:14,160
Does the council accept
their clandestine wedding?

807
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,250
Yes

808
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:16,580
-You all agree?
-Yes

809
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,830
Yes

810
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:24,500
What about my money?

811
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,540
If that is settled

812
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:30,290
I'll be very grateful

813
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:31,830
The money...

814
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:36,910
I'll repay it little by little

815
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:37,870
No!

816
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,620
Not little by little

817
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,000
I want my money at one go

818
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:45,910
and I want it right now

819
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:47,450
You'll get it

820
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:49,410
The girls haven't married into a poor family

821
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:50,750
Am I right?

822
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:52,580
- Huh?
- They agree

823
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:54,330
It will be sent to you,
with interest

824
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:11,870
I'll drop by in the evening

825
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,330
Get lost!

826
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:17,330
One last thing...

827
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:22,580
they belong to
different castes, therefore

828
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:27,700
their respective families must approve

829
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:30,120
Grandma

830
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:32,000
do you accept?

831
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:38,830
Yes

832
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:44,120
Shanti Bhushan?

833
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:49,200
I want to have a word with my daughters

834
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,330
Can you survive under one roof?

835
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:02,620
You'll make life miserable for each other

836
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:04,620
Think about it, you still have time

837
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,080
Bapu...

838
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,450
my husband has got a new job

839
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:14,040
So, I will move to the city

840
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:20,700
And my husband's army training is finished

841
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:21,910
so now it's posting and shifting

842
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:24,120
No

843
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:28,080
Give me your word

844
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:33,330
the one who initiates the fight
will be responsible for my death

845
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,040
I love you, Bapu

846
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,620
I won't fight anymore,
you have my word

847
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,910
Saying it in English,
doesn't make my love any less

848
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,580
I won't fight anymore

849
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:51,290
you have my word

850
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:55,910
Let's have music!

851
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:25,250
I will repay you,
little by little

852
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,330
My salary barely covers my expenses

853
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:41,450
Have patience

854
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,830
as soon as I get promoted,
I'll call for you

855
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:48,950
Families are not allowed in war zones

856
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:56,950
Trust me, I had no idea that
I'd be posted in Kashmir

857
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:00,540
And what about my dairy?

858
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,000
The money from grandfather's trust

859
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:12,370
is gone

860
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:13,580
Where?

861
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:18,370
To repay Bapu's loan

862
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:27,870
Bapu himself didn't know,
how long it would take him to repay the loan

863
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:40,910
The fate of the two sisters was
stuck to each other like a coin to a magnet

864
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:48,410
Until Bapu's loan got repaid

865
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:52,000
they had to be away from their husbands

866
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:56,290
and live together under one roof

867
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:04,120
Repeat after me

868
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:05,750
A for?

869
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:06,870
Aalu

870
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,080
B for?

871
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,250
Bhindi

872
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:10,410
C for?

873
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:11,750
Chutney

874
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:13,910
- D for?- Darwaza

875
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:16,620
- E for?- Emlee

876
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:17,750
Who sleepy?

877
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:26,950
Chutki!

878
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:29,000
Out!

879
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:39,330
Their dreams would blow up like balloons

880
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:24,540
Their ambitions remained unfulfilled
even in their dreams

881
01:15:28,910 --> 01:15:33,620
Due to Bapu's promise
and accepting their fate

882
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,370
they decided on a ceasefire

883
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:44,750
But this decision proved too costly...

884
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,540
They were alive, so to say, but

885
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,540
their life was a living hell

886
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,910
Raj Laxmi lottery

887
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:09,540
Turn rupees five to 500,000!

888
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:15,750
Dipper!

889
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,250
Dipper!

890
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,450
Dipper

891
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,200
You bumbling fools,
you are still alive?

892
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,410
You've put on so much weight

893
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:32,580
Like you care!

894
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:35,000
Not once did you check on us

895
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:36,540
I myself was in trouble

896
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:37,910
What?

897
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,200
Working with a shaman

898
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,750
selling magical concoctions

899
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:43,000
To cure what?

900
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:46,200
To help the old feel virile again

901
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:47,950
And?

902
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:50,660
Two old men died

903
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,620
The shaman ran away...

904
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:53,540
and I ended up in prison

905
01:16:58,250 --> 01:16:59,500
Bapu has sent this

906
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,080
installment towards the loan

907
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:02,750
It seems too little

908
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,750
Bapu is in a mess, Grandma

909
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:09,120
The officer who took the bribe
got transferred

910
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:11,450
And the new one is awful

911
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:13,370
Alright

912
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:16,120
Bapu's loan will not be paid in this lifetime

913
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:17,410
Come on

914
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,540
Here's a lottery ticket

915
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,580
If you win, the loan is cleared

916
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:22,830
Yeah, right

917
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:26,910
Take this

918
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:29,160
deposit in the bank tomorrow

919
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:30,790
Okay, Grandma

920
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,580
Listen, it's the holy month

921
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:36,330
I want to go to Kashi to offer prayers

922
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,620
I don't think I'll get leave

923
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:42,410
And I have day and night training

924
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,500
Fine, I'll go on my own!

925
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,370
Come, let's go to school

926
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:52,160
- Bye
- Bye

927
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:54,290
Sm-art phone

928
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,620
The world at your fingertips

929
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,250
Any movie, any song, on demand

930
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:03,410
and video call,
don't even get me started on that

931
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:05,950
You can almost touch the person

932
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,660
- Really?
- Check it out

933
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:08,910
Impressive

934
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:14,290
Look at this

935
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:16,700
Look at this!

Look at this

942
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,700
News of England,
America, Russia...

943
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:38,540
Look at this!
Your favourite Salman Khan

944

Look at Katrina Kaif's moves

945
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:55,290
Have both of you lost it?

946
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,700
Stop it!
Stop this farce!

947
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:00,580
Stop it

948
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,250
Take a look at yourselves

949
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:10,330
Your vacant eyes

950
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:12,910
and your face

951
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:15,950
like the emergency room
of a public hospital!

952
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:23,330
Why are you torturing yourselves?

953
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:27,120
What is this?

954
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:34,040
Life has become unbearable

955
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:36,950
it hurts

956
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:42,910
If it weren't for my daughter,
I would have taken my own life

957
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,250
It wouldn't come to that

958
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,660
If I hadn't promised Bapu

959
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,950
I would have killed you by now

960
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,870
This is our life now

961
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:05,910
put up with each other
and suffer every moment

962
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:09,910
And your dreams?

963
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:12,250
Dairy...

964
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:13,910
School...

965
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:17,500
It's over

966
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:20,500
flushed down the drain

967
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,750
Along with my dairy

968
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,120
There's nothing we can do now

969
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:31,200
We have no option left

970
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:33,580
You do

971
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:37,790
What?

972
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:40,540
Partition

973
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:46,500
Partition of India and Pakistan

974
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:58,290
Who is Pakistan?

975
01:20:58,910 --> 01:20:59,660
Your sister

976
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:01,660
That wicked witch

977
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:09,950
My dear beautiful India

978
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,410
But I promised Bapu

979
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:19,160
You promised not to fight
with each other

980
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:24,250
but what stops you from making others fight

981
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:28,830
Partition is impossible

982
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:30,910
Not a chance!

983
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:32,790
You've seen

984
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:34,700
the brothers have a very strong bond

985
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:40,370
A woman is capable of turning
the strongest of bonds into crap

986
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:43,450
father and son, brothers,
any relation, you name it

987
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,200
over in the blink of an eye

988
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:47,950
Once the fields are divided

989
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:50,950
sell your share and fulfil your dreams

990
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,910
That won't be possible

991
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:53,790
Why not?

992
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,620
Because the value of the field is 200,000

993
01:21:58,790 --> 01:21:59,950
I can get 400,000

994
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:01,250
From?

995
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,580
Such a cute couple

996
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,200
Where is the bride from?

997
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:35,750
Nepal

998
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:38,790
How much did you pay?

999
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:40,200
Half

1000
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:42,250
How?

1001
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:45,410
Thanks to the exchange rate

1002
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:54,660
Why are you here now, Dipper?

1003
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:57,500
To apologise

1004
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,080
To apologise

1005
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:01,540
No

1006
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:04,040
Never

1007
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,870
I'll never forgive you

1008
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,700
What if I break up their household?

1009
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,160
Not even then?

1010
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:20,200
How?

1011
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:22,750
You'll have to buy their field

1012
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:24,330
For how much?

1013
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:26,250
Twice the rate

1014
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:29,290
Too much?

1015
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:32,200
My humiliation is still raw

1016
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:36,200
I'll even pay three times the rate

1017
01:23:37,290 --> 01:23:38,290
Get it?

1018
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:43,120
Feed me!

1019
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:54,290
Open the door!

1020
01:23:55,790 --> 01:23:56,830
Open the door!

1021
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:00,700
Come out!

1022
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:04,040
What is that?

1023
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:04,910
What?

1024
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:06,080
Come out

1025
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:08,580
Look! What's this?

1026
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:11,330
What?

1027
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:12,500
Disgusting!

1028
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:14,750
Your little one's pot of gold

1029
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:16,410
Does it say it belongs to my daughter?

1030
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:17,250
It must be yours

1031
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:18,790
Are you blind?

1032
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:19,830
Look...

1033
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,080
See the guava seeds

1034
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:21,660
So?

1035
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:23,580
My daughter had grapes yesterday

1036
01:24:23,870 --> 01:24:24,870
And mine had apples

1037
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:27,080
Has anyone ever had apples
in your family?

1038
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,580
- And you have in your dreams
- Watch your step

1039
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:30,290
- Don't insult my family
- You don't

1040
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:30,950
What’s wrong?

1041
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:32,620
This bitch is creating a scene

1042
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,370
- Watch your tongue
- Why should I?

1043
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:35,870
Because my husband is an officer

1044
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:37,370
and not a low ranking sepoy

1045
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:39,120
who only salutes his superiors all day

1046
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:43,830
My husband is a paratrooper.
He
jumps from airplanes!

1047
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:45,950
In English it's called an
"aeroplane"

1048
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:54,200
And officers like your husband are a dime a dozen

1049
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:56,330
Did you hear that?

1050
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:58,580
She's calling you worthless

1051
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:01,790
Worthless!

1052
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:02,370
Say something

1053
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:03,410
Yes, worthless!

1054
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:07,000
You witch, your husband is worthless!

1055
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:08,330
Vishnu

1056
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:09,370
Jagan

1057
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:18,000
Come inside

1058
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:25,290
I can't believe how you were fighting

1059
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:27,040
Like cats and dogs

1060
01:25:28,910 --> 01:25:30,910
Nobody will believe that you are sisters

1061
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:35,870
Miss Marigold...

1062
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:39,160
listen to me very carefully

1063
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:43,330
I won't tolerate this
kind of behaviour anymore

1064
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:46,040
Understand?

1065
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:54,120
Don't let the family fall apart, please

1066
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:56,370
No, Grandma, please don't cry

1067
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,200
We've spoken to both of them

1068
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:04,450
Don't cry

1069
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
As long as America is present here,
we can't do anything

1070
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:12,830
America?

1071
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:13,580
Grandma!

1072
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:16,830
Until she is here all efforts are futile

1073
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:20,000
Nobody has a solution for America

1074
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:23,950
Except for me

1075
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:43,790
Is there any direct train
to Kashi from here?

1076
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:47,790
Who is going to Kashi?

1077
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,620
I have to perform my mother's last rites

1078
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:52,580
I thought I'd leave from here

1079
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,660
Thank God!

1080
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:06,790
You have four days

1081
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:09,660
Before the old lady returns

1082
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:11,750
the border should be drawn

1083
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:14,410
Dipper

1084
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:15,540
Give me a minute

1085
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,040
Best of luck!

1086
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:33,160
My heart is beating,
keeps on repeating

1087
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:37,000
I'm waiting for you

1088
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:41,080
Where were you, darling?

1089
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:43,410
Feeding the buffaloes

1090
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:44,370
This time?

1091
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:46,450
Yes

1092
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:08,580
Darling, did someone say something?

1093
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:13,660
What's wrong?

1094
01:28:14,410 --> 01:28:16,250
What do you care?

1095
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:20,040
If I die today
you'll get another darling tomorrow

1096
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:25,790
Will you tell me what happened?

1097
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:27,870
Your sister-in-law

1098
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:32,200
She cuts the good grass
and leaves the rotten stuff for me

1099
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,950
The buffalo has been
hungry since morning

1100
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:37,580
If I object, she hits me

1101
01:28:37,950 --> 01:28:39,410
her husband threatens too

1102
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:40,160
He threatens?

1103
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:42,910
What did he say?

1104
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:48,750
He said, she will do as she wishes

1105
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,410
It's better to die than to live like this

1106
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:58,500
I'll speak to my brother tomorrow

1107
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,040
You don't cry

1108
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:01,660
Okay?

1109
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:03,200
God promise?

1110
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,500
God promise

1111
01:29:23,330 --> 01:29:25,200
Don't fall for her sob stories

1112
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:30,330
Your wife is lying

1113
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:31,580
Brother

1114
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:32,620
What?

1115
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:35,500
Our fields are joined

1116
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:36,370
So?

1117
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:38,160
Control your wife

1118
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:39,250
And if not?

1119
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,250
What will you do about it?

1120
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:43,950
Hit me?

1121
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:44,910
Raise your hand at me?

1122
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:46,500
That's up to you

1123
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:47,200
Junior!

1124
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:51,120
Watch your mouth!

1125
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:52,660
I don't need to learn from you

1126
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,080
You hear that?

1127
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,500
Shut up, will you!

1128
01:29:55,910 --> 01:29:57,120
You're responsible for this

1129
01:29:58,660 --> 01:29:59,500
I'm responsible?

1130
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:01,450
You're blaming me?

1131
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,000
And that ox’s wife...

1132
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,200
she's a saint?

1133
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:07,410
You hear that?

1134
01:30:07,790 --> 01:30:08,790
She called you an ox

1135
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:11,370
Do you know what the villagers
call your husband?

1136
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:14,830
That he's a wuss

1137
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:16,750
- You wretch--
- Sister-in-law!

1138
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:17,750
Junior!

1139
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:38,660
Satisfied?

1140
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:57,790
Congratulations!

1141
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,200
We are back in two days

1142
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:02,870
Time for phase two

1143
01:31:04,910 --> 01:31:05,910
Praise the goddess

1144
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:07,870
- Okay
- Ta-ta

1145
01:31:58,700 --> 01:31:59,700
Please don't cry

1146
01:32:03,290 --> 01:32:04,790
Now celebrate

1147
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:08,950
You've taken away a piece of my soul

1148
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,040
The one responsible for this...

1149
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,450
will suffer

1150
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,540
Suffer!

1151
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,410
It's just a phone

1152
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:32,200
I'll get you another one

1153
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,250
Let's go inside

1154
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:35,700
come on

1155
01:32:38,370 --> 01:32:39,870
My phone...

1156
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,040
English or Hindi?

1157
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,200
English

1158
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:07,200
In all these years

1159
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:11,370
I have never
seen a TV in such bad shape

1160
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:14,250
This can't be fixed

1161
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:15,870
Sorry

1162
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:35,950
Tickets?

1163
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,200
Here, keep them

1164
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:44,870
Are you happy now, bitch?

1165
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,450
This is karma

1166
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,450
As you sow, so shall you reap

1167
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:53,410
It's not karma,
you poured
water on the TV

1168
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:55,040
Really? You have any proof?

1169
01:33:55,290 --> 01:33:56,700
The look on your face says it all

1170
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,500
Take a look at yourself
and show it to your worthless husband!

1171
01:34:01,370 --> 01:34:02,370
She called you worthless!

1172
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:04,250
Shut your trap

1173
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:06,660
One slap and you'll cry all night

1174
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,040
I dare you

1175
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:11,620
I'll make sure you regret it

1176
01:34:11,870 --> 01:34:13,370
Keep your threats to yourself

1177
01:34:13,370 --> 01:34:15,120
He's not a coward to be scared of you

1178
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:18,080
And you think my husband won't fight back?

1179
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:19,540
Send in your worthless bull!

1180
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:21,250
Go on!

1181
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,080
I said go

1182
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:25,200
So, brother-in-law,
did you shit yourself?

1183
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:26,660
How dare you!

1184
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:34,580
- Come on, Vishnu!
- Break his head

1185
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:36,660
- Vishnu!
- Come on!

1186
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:50,950
What are you waiting
for?

1187
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,750
Go for it

1188
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,250
Is this the state of the Indian army?

1189
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:59,450
Long Live Mother India!

1190
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,200
Junior!

1191
01:35:27,950 --> 01:35:28,950
What's going on?

1192
01:35:58,540 --> 01:35:59,540
This way, my dear

1193
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:27,700
I don't understand

1194
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:37,540
Jagan

1195
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:40,250
listen...

1196
01:36:40,290 --> 01:36:43,370
don't let anger cloud your judgement

1197
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,750
Calm down and think about it

1198
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:50,540
Trust me, I am calm

1199
01:36:58,620 --> 01:36:59,870
Vishnu

1200
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:06,950
give it another thought

1201
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:16,540
Are you responsible for this?

1202
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:18,750
No, Bapu

1203
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:19,540
You swear?

1204
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:24,950
Is that a yes or a no?

1205
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,040
Look after Vishnu

1206
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,120
And that's how

1207
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:31,080
Without any bloodshed
India and Pakistan were partitioned

1208
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:41,830
Cracker to the left
Cracker to the right

1209
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:44,040
Boom, boom goes the cracker

1210
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,200
Cracker to the left
Cracker to the right

1211
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:52,750
Boom, boom goes the cracker

1212
01:38:56,290 --> 01:39:00,330
Elbows you
Knees you too

1213
01:39:00,790 --> 01:39:02,830
Elbows you
Knees you too

1214
01:39:02,830 --> 01:39:08,250
Explodes in the head
Bang, bang goes the cracker

1215
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:10,250
Cracker to the left
Cracker to the right

1216
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:12,290
Boom, boom goes the cracker

1217
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:17,330
Boom goes the cracker

1218
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,500
Boom goes the cracker

1219
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:30,200
What is this?

1220
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:33,700
So many mistakes on each page

1221
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:39,290
Falling over each other
constantly at war

1222
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:47,870
The victor showing off
Yawning, stretching casually

1223
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:56,750
free-for-all

1224
01:39:57,330 --> 01:40:01,500
Flares up on demand

1225
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,410
Just place your order

1226
01:40:03,410 --> 01:40:08,160
Here and there and everywhere
Come, get your fireball

1227
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:09,200
Cracker to the left
Cracker to the right

1228
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:12,040
Hurry up

1229
01:40:13,450 --> 01:40:15,040
Sweep properly

1230
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:19,120
Nobody listens to me

1231
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:33,700
Scream your lungs out, squabbling

1232
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:37,580
Squabbling

1233
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:50,080
Scream your lungs out, squabbling

1234
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:55,290
Get hold of the collar
Tear and stitch it every day

1235
01:40:56,540 --> 01:41:00,700
Once more, an encore please

1236
01:41:00,830 --> 01:41:02,790
Light the firecracker once more

1237
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:06,000
Boom, boom and
Bang, bang, there goes the cracker

1238
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:08,120
Cracker to the left
Cracker to the right

1239
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:10,790
Boom, boom goes the cracker

1240
01:41:14,450 --> 01:41:16,540
Cracker to the left
Cracker to the right

1241
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:19,200
Boom, boom goes the cracker

1242
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,660
Boom goes the cracker

1243
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:27,910
Boom goes the cracker

1244
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:32,080
Boom goes the cracker

1245
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:36,290
Boom goes the cracker

1246
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:46,040
Marigold...

1247
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:47,620
you did it!

1248
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,250
Cracker to the left
Cracker to the right

1249
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:52,910
Boom, boom goes the cracker

1250
01:41:55,870 --> 01:41:57,750
Boom goes the cracker

1251
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:01,620
Boom goes the cracker

1252
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:05,790
Boom goes the cracker

1253
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:10,040
Boom goes the cracker

1254
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:23,250
Give me some

1255
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:25,540
Me too

1256
01:42:27,950 --> 01:42:29,910
You want some more?

1257
01:42:30,290 --> 01:42:31,290
Bapu!

1258
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:34,620
Bapu...

1259
01:42:36,290 --> 01:42:38,950
My princess...

1260
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:40,410
My child...

1261
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:42,200
My dear

1262
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,620
Fulfilled your dream?

1263
01:42:44,370 --> 01:42:44,870
Yes

1264
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,040
What's with the cough?

1265
01:42:46,370 --> 01:42:47,580
It's nothing

1266
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,200
Look at this

1267
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:58,370
Dear family members
and all the
friends in the village

1268
01:42:58,950 --> 01:43:02,120
with your
blessings,
I have topped in my
institute

1269
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:05,290
I have also earned scholarship
for my further studies

1270
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:10,870
The day is not far when I will be a
teacher
and open a school in the
village

1271
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:14,910
Love to all of you.
See you very, very soon

1272
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:17,620
Wait a minute,
forgot to ask

1273
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:20,040
How are you, Mother Dairy?

1274
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:28,200
Bapu, once more

1275
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:34,410
Today we are talking to the recipient of
the Golden Cow award, Mrs. Champa Kumari

1276
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:36,500
Mother, look aunt is on TV

1277
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:37,540
What?

1278
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:39,700
How does it feel to win this?

1279
01:43:40,410 --> 01:43:43,830
Genda, come soon,
your sister is on TV

1280
01:43:46,370 --> 01:43:48,910
It feels good, feels great

1281
01:43:49,370 --> 01:43:51,410
What's the secret of your success?

1282
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:53,450
Well, cows

1283
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:56,120
How so?

1284
01:43:56,410 --> 01:43:57,410
Cows have...

1285
01:43:57,620 --> 01:44:01,120
a certain innocence, a giving nature
and they are meek

1286
01:44:01,870 --> 01:44:06,370
but if anybody troubles them,
they will chase you until kingdom come

1287
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:08,870
You could say

1288
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:13,040
Every cow is Champa and
Champa is in every cow

1289
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:18,790
Every cow is Champa and
Champa is in every cow

1290
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:21,330
Champa is in every cow

1291
01:44:35,410 --> 01:44:37,250
Every cow is Champa

1292
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:39,450
and Champa is in every cow

1293
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,950
Every cow is Champa

1294
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:03,870
Every cow is Champa

1295
01:45:04,450 --> 01:45:06,000
and Champa is in every cow

1296
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:17,950
Every cow is Champa

1297
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,750
and Champa is in every cow

1298
01:45:41,870 --> 01:45:42,200
Sir

1299
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:43,290
Vishnu

1300
01:45:43,950 --> 01:45:44,950
She's awake now

1301
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:46,120
But...

1302
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,250
there seems to be a problem
with her vision

1303
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:50,200
Sir, what do you mean?

1304
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:52,700
She can't see anything

1305
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:56,700
Don't worry, we've called an eye surgeon

1306
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:58,160
Come

1307
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,200
Who is it?

1308
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:12,540
Vishnu

1309
01:46:13,790 --> 01:46:14,790
Vishnu...

1310
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:18,200
What's wrong with my eyes?

1311
01:46:20,370 --> 01:46:22,370
I can't see anything

1312
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:24,620
It will be all right

1313
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,040
I've gone blind

1314
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:30,540
No, Marigold

1315
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:44,290
How are you, Mother Dairy?

1316
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:46,160
What is it?

1317
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,370
How are you, Mother Dairy?

1318
01:46:52,450 --> 01:46:55,620
How are you, Mother Dairy?

1319
01:46:57,620 --> 01:46:59,660
open a school in the
village

1320
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:10,790
Come out and talk

1321
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:13,910
Come out I say,
enough of your English

1322
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:16,620
You wait...

1323
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:23,000
You got scared?

1324
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:24,700
Witch! Come out!

1325
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:29,250
- Come out, I say
- Champa?

1326
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:31,450
What's wrong?

1327
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:34,290
I think the witch from the well
has possessed her

1328
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:41,000
Wait, I'll show you

1329
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:44,080
You wait!

1330
01:47:44,450 --> 01:47:45,450
Champa...

1331
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:46,620
Oh, no

1332
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:58,120
Lie down, don't try to get up

1333
01:48:01,290 --> 01:48:03,040
you seem to be under stress

1334
01:48:06,910 --> 01:48:08,080
are you nauseous?

1335
01:48:11,540 --> 01:48:12,540
How does your mouth taste?

1336
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:16,750
Sour or bitter?

1337
01:48:18,910 --> 01:48:19,660
Tell me

1338
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:22,330
Badki

1339
01:48:28,410 --> 01:48:29,250
Tell me

1340
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:32,620
Tell him, Champa

1341
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:41,200
Hello?

1342
01:48:42,370 --> 01:48:42,700
Hello?

1343
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:45,950
Hello Badki

1344
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:47,500
Hello?

1345
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:50,580
Can you hear me?

1346
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:53,290
Badki?

1347
01:48:53,870 --> 01:48:54,540
What's wrong?

1348
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:02,370
Hello, Jagan
This is Khenchu Maharaj...

1349
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:04,580
come home as soon as you can

1350
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:06,950
Badki has become
mute

1351
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:09,450
Mute? What do you mean?

1352
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:29,410
The reports seem good

1353
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:33,040
Then why can't she see, doctor?

1354
01:49:34,790 --> 01:49:35,950
That remains to be seen

1355
01:50:05,290 --> 01:50:09,290
Your daughter-in-law desecrated
the sanctity of the well

1356
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:14,120
and that's when the witch possessed her

1357
01:50:14,450 --> 01:50:16,870
Help us please, witch doctor

1358
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:24,660
It'll take a goat and a bottle of whiskey

1359
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:26,660
Okay

1360
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:44,160
You evil spirit,
I command you to come out

1361
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:46,790
Set her throat free

1362
01:50:47,790 --> 01:50:48,540
Evil spirit!

1363
01:50:51,330 --> 01:50:52,000
Badki

1364
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:54,120
You hit me?

1365
01:50:54,450 --> 01:50:55,700
How dare you!

1366
01:51:02,910 --> 01:51:04,750
Badki...

1367
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:10,290
Badki...

1368
01:51:10,370 --> 01:51:11,250
Listen to me

1369
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:12,830
Somebody grab her

1370
01:51:16,790 --> 01:51:17,870
Stop her

1371
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,370
Stop her

1372
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:31,410
She'll kill him

1373
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:36,580
Drop this, let's go inside

1374
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:41,540
Yes, Vishnu?

1375
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:42,750
Come inside

1376
01:51:46,790 --> 01:51:47,660
What?

1377
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:55,370
Bapu...

1378
01:51:57,200 --> 01:51:58,450
God bless you

1379
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:05,120
Genda, we'll be conducting
some advance tests

1380
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:06,870
Are you ready?

1381
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:08,450
Open your mouth

1382
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:25,870
Lift your thumb

1383
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:27,410
Good

1384
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:31,330
Now, touch your right thumb
to your left thumb

1385
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:32,500
Go on

1386
01:52:34,410 --> 01:52:35,620
Try it

1387
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:37,120
It's okay

1388
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:38,500
Tell me your name?

1389
01:52:43,290 --> 01:52:43,950
Okay

1390
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:48,000
I want you to hum

1391
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:52,080
Okay

1392
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:54,080
Be careful

1393
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:55,330
Very good

1394
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:01,950
There's a door ten steps ahead of you

1395
01:53:03,790 --> 01:53:04,370
Walk towards it

1396
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:06,450
No... I'll fall down

1397
01:53:07,290 --> 01:53:08,540
You won't fall

1398
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:10,410
There's nothing in the way

1399
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:13,000
Go on

1400
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:16,410
Massage your throat
three times a day

1401
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:21,120
You need to massage like this.
Okay?

1402
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:32,620
Very good

1403
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:46,450
Okay

1404
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:49,910
Please wait outside

1405
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:53,620
Not you

1406
01:53:54,250 --> 01:53:55,410
You go on

1407
01:53:59,790 --> 01:54:01,790
This is hysterical blindness

1408
01:54:04,410 --> 01:54:07,410
A psychosomatic prodrome
called hysterical aphonia

1409
01:54:08,410 --> 01:54:09,790
What do you mean?

1410
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:11,750
It means she can see...

1411
01:54:12,910 --> 01:54:15,250
but her mind prevents her from seeing

1412
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:18,750
How so?

1413
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:23,290
It's like a blind person knows
where his mouth is

1414
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:25,000
where his thumb is

1415
01:54:25,540 --> 01:54:28,580
but he can't see the chair
kept in his way

1416
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:32,870
If a mute can cough,
that means his voice box is fine

1417
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:37,620
What causes this?

1418
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:39,700
She seems to have a lot of angst

1419
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:41,370
a deep wound

1420
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:44,290
sadness or she is annoyed with someone

1421
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:47,450
And that's blocking her cornea

1422
01:54:48,450 --> 01:54:49,620
What's the cure for this?

1423
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:50,830
Psychiatrist

1424
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:56,120
or you can help her heal
with love and affection

1425
01:54:56,370 --> 01:54:57,870
Once that knot gets untied

1426
01:54:58,250 --> 01:55:00,250
she'll see again

1427
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:03,080
She'll not only talk, but sing too

1428
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:11,790
Chutki...

1429
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:16,870
tell me something

1430
01:55:20,450 --> 01:55:21,950
How much do you
love me?

1431
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:30,080
What's eating you up?

1432
01:55:31,700 --> 01:55:32,540
Eating me up?

1433
01:55:33,290 --> 01:55:35,790
Don't keep it all to yourself

1434
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:37,580
tell me

1435
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:39,500
what is it?

1436
01:55:40,750 --> 01:55:42,450
Why are you asking me this?

1437
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:44,750
Because the doctor said

1438
01:55:45,250 --> 01:55:47,830
that you can see,
but you don't want to

1439
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:52,450
There's nothing wrong with your throat

1440
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:55,830
Medically

1441
01:55:57,250 --> 01:55:58,080
You mean

1442
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:01,500
I'm pretending to be blind?

1443
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:03,080
No...

1444
01:56:03,870 --> 01:56:07,790
And you believe the doctor?

1445
01:56:14,410 --> 01:56:16,000
No, Badki...

1446
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,410
You're taking it the wrong way

1447
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:21,040
I'll give that doctor a piece of my mind

1448
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:23,870
take me to the hospital

1449
01:56:24,580 --> 01:56:27,290
- Right now
- You're taking it the wrong way

1450
01:56:27,370 --> 01:56:30,620
I've gone blind and you think I'm pretending

1451
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:31,370
Badki...

1452
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:32,620
Badki...

1453
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:33,910
Badki!

1454
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:37,370
Don't take it out on your medicine

1455
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:47,580
Genda

1456
01:56:47,950 --> 01:56:49,450
don't forget to put eyedrop, okay?

1457
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:51,500
Two eyedrop...

1458
01:56:51,580 --> 01:56:52,660
each eye, okay?

1459
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:54,250
Take care

1460
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:55,830
I'm getting late

1461
01:57:57,790 --> 01:57:58,540
Genda...

1462
01:57:59,910 --> 01:58:00,830
open the door

1463
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:03,410
It's time for Bapu to leave

1464
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:10,080
Trust me, I don't want to go but...

1465
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:12,500
But you are

1466
01:58:14,410 --> 01:58:15,830
It's the festival of Holi tomorrow

1467
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:18,910
And Badki's
situation has worsened

1468
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:20,250
Now I've realised...

1469
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:22,410
that you love her more than me

1470
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:24,450
Go and consider me dead

1471
01:58:25,410 --> 01:58:26,580
Chutki...

1472
01:58:31,290 --> 01:58:32,700
I'll miss the train

1473
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:34,620
Chutki, listen...

1474
01:58:48,410 --> 01:58:49,120
Move aside

1475
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:52,450
Everything for rupees 10,
combs, mirrors, oil

1476
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:56,080
chewing gum... rupees 10 flat rate

1477
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:58,160
Use this oil your hair will come back

1478
01:58:58,200 --> 01:58:58,750
Get lost!

1479
01:58:58,870 --> 01:59:01,700
Mirror, oil, toys, chewing gum...

1480
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:03,040
rupees 10 flat rate

1481
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:05,330
mirrors, oil

1482
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:15,040
Everything for rupees 10,
combs, mirrors, oil

1483
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:17,660
Special rate for you

1484
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:19,370
rupees two

1485
01:59:19,410 --> 01:59:20,410
Don't bother me

1486
01:59:22,580 --> 01:59:24,080
Dipper, it's you

1487
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:26,580
Bapu, you're not dead yet?

1488
01:59:27,620 --> 01:59:29,370
I'm hardly alive

1489
01:59:31,870 --> 01:59:33,080
Make room for me

1490
01:59:35,290 --> 01:59:35,950
What's wrong?

1491
01:59:37,540 --> 01:59:39,750
Both my daughters lives are ruined

1492
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:42,750
Bapu, don't cry

1493
01:59:42,950 --> 01:59:46,500
- Ruined
- No, Bapu...

1494
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:56,250
The cure for both is the same, Bapu

1495
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:02,290
for the blind and the mute

1496
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:04,540
What?

1497
02:00:06,910 --> 02:00:07,580
War

1498
02:00:08,580 --> 02:00:10,250
Enough, you meddler

1499
02:00:12,870 --> 02:00:14,370
But it's the truth

1500
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,040
first a thunderous war

1501
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:21,620
followed by
long-lasting peace

1502
02:00:23,580 --> 02:00:24,500
I told you

1503
02:00:25,290 --> 02:00:28,000
they're like India and
Pakistan

1504
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:31,620
Unless they fight,
they can't be happy

1505
02:00:35,870 --> 02:00:37,080
Dipper, the ticket collector

1506
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:37,620
Let's go

1507
02:00:38,450 --> 02:00:39,540
I'll meet you at the next station

1508
02:00:56,250 --> 02:00:58,660
Stop right here

1509
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:00,410
That's enough

1510
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:02,040
Brake... brake

1511
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:04,370
Bapu, let's go, we're home

1512
02:01:08,580 --> 02:01:10,790
You've slept enough, wake up

1513
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:15,450
Bapu...

1514
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:19,910
Bapu?

1515
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:04,290
You sent word to Vishnu?

1516
02:02:04,540 --> 02:02:05,870
Yes, I called this morning

1517
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:08,410
They should be here soon

1518
02:02:09,250 --> 02:02:10,660
Bapu...

1519
02:02:14,580 --> 02:02:16,080
Bapu...

1520
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:27,370
Genda...

1521
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:28,950
Bapu...

1522
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:34,120
Bapu...

1523
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:40,040
You can't go away like this

1524
02:02:42,910 --> 02:02:44,450
Bapu...

1525
02:02:45,790 --> 02:02:48,000
I can't even see you

1526
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:51,750
I know, my sister has killed you

1527
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:55,450
Badki took your life

1528
02:02:58,540 --> 02:03:00,540
Bapu...

1529
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:04,830
Bapu...

1530
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:08,080
She killed you

1531
02:03:11,290 --> 02:03:12,290
Bapu...

1532
02:03:20,410 --> 02:03:22,250
Bapu...

1533
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:30,040
This bitch must have poisoned you

1534
02:03:30,370 --> 02:03:31,870
She poisoned you

1535
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:38,160
You took Bapu's life,
now you're here for us?

1536
02:03:38,450 --> 02:03:39,830
You evil witch

1537
02:03:39,950 --> 02:03:41,120
I poisoned him?

1538
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:42,580
You're accusing me?

1539
02:03:43,950 --> 02:03:46,040
You lying witch

1540
02:03:46,410 --> 02:03:49,410
Because of you he's dried up like a twig

1541
02:03:49,620 --> 02:03:52,290
and look at you,
how you have ballooned

1542
02:03:52,370 --> 02:03:53,700
You can see this balloon?

1543
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:54,910
Of course, look

1544
02:03:55,450 --> 02:03:58,790
running a dairy farm
she's become a buffalo herself

1545
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:02,200
If you're the wife of a soldier,
then step outside

1546
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:06,250
I will perform your final rites before Bapu's.
I swear!

1547
02:04:06,250 --> 02:04:06,580
Come

1548
02:04:06,910 --> 02:04:08,080
Come on, Mrs. Telephone!

1549
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:11,540
I'll cremate you before Bapu!

1550
02:04:12,750 --> 02:04:13,950
Come on, Badki
Let's go, Chutki

1551
02:04:13,950 --> 02:04:16,160
Today we'll decide once and for all

1552
02:04:16,290 --> 02:04:18,660
What the hell are you doing, Dipper?

1553
02:04:18,750 --> 02:04:20,080
No one will stop us today

1554
02:04:21,410 --> 02:04:22,910
No one will stop us today...

1555
02:04:23,450 --> 02:04:25,120
you have your kids swear

1556
02:04:25,950 --> 02:04:27,000
and your buffaloes

1557
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:29,580
Here you go

1558
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:33,700
Whoever interferes
will feel the wrath of my rod

1559
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:37,700
There's no use being kind

1560
02:04:38,540 --> 02:04:41,160
No matter what you do,
evil always creeps in

1561
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:43,790
You're right, sister

1562
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:45,450
Everyone just sees their deeds

1563
02:04:47,450 --> 02:04:50,160
and turns a blind eye to the world

1564
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:55,750
Yes, I was blind!

1565
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:57,790
but you didn't even call me

1566
02:04:59,370 --> 02:05:01,200
I was possessed by a witch
and I couldn't talk

1567
02:05:01,910 --> 02:05:03,910
You didn't even ask how I was doing

1568
02:05:04,410 --> 02:05:06,330
Why didn't you ask first?

1569
02:05:07,250 --> 02:05:09,750
You don't even know what love is

1570
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:14,540
Every night you would drop your blanket
and shiver in the cold

1571
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:16,910
Who covered you up?

1572
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:18,120
Mother's ghost?

1573
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:21,160
You want me to recount?

1574
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:23,750
When you were down with malaria...

1575
02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:26,120
I fasted for 16 days

1576
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:27,910
For whom? Huh?

1577
02:05:28,290 --> 02:05:29,660
For that pervert Patel?

1578
02:05:34,370 --> 02:05:36,450
When you got your first period...

1579
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:38,830
you were scared out of you wits

1580
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:40,870
who explained it to you?

1581
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:44,410
I tore my own clothes
to make a pad for you

1582
02:05:46,620 --> 02:05:48,200
You wore a loose tunic...

1583
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:50,580
I saved every penny...

1584
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:52,660
and brought you your first bra

1585
02:05:57,700 --> 02:06:01,040
I even ate lady finger for you

1586
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:02,910
And I drank milk

1587
02:06:02,950 --> 02:06:04,790
The most disgusting thing ever

1588
02:06:05,450 --> 02:06:06,950
You ungrateful witch

1589
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:22,830
Don't cry!

1590
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:24,950
Fight!

1591
02:06:28,410 --> 02:06:29,500
Bapu!

1592
02:06:30,620 --> 02:06:31,700
Bapu...

1593
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:35,620
Why did you stop?

1594
02:06:36,790 --> 02:06:37,790
Fight some more

1595
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:39,540
or you'll start limping next

1596
02:06:40,580 --> 02:06:41,910
and then Dipper

1597
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:44,620
will ask me to play dead again

1598
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:50,580
It is the truth...

1599
02:06:51,870 --> 02:06:54,750
your peace remains in your war

1600
02:06:55,700 --> 02:06:57,410
So, my India-Pakistan...

1601
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:01,450
Go fight

1602
02:07:01,870 --> 02:07:03,040
fight...

1603
02:07:10,700 --> 02:07:11,700
Come witch...

1604
02:07:12,250 --> 02:07:12,750
take a shot

1605
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:16,750
You dirty wretch...

1606
02:07:25,700 --> 02:07:26,700
Happy Holi!

1607
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:34,250
I wish a day would come when...

1608
02:07:34,910 --> 02:07:36,950
just like Badki and Chutki

1609
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:38,950
Israel and Palestine

1610
02:07:39,750 --> 02:07:41,450
North Korea and South Korea

1611
02:07:42,250 --> 02:07:43,910
India and Pakistan

1612
02:07:44,290 --> 02:07:46,370
end their disagreements

1613
02:07:46,870 --> 02:07:48,540
and come together with love
