1
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:59,018
'This world is a stage.
We all are actors on that stage'

2
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:07,060
'This dialogue is as
true as it is routine'

3
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:10,896
'Another routine dialogue is
that god makes man a puppet''

4
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,664
'And who does man make a puppet?
Surely another man !'

5
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:23,537
'Because every man's life is
dependent on the one next to him'

6
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:28,345
'All we hold are the lines
on our palms, not our fate'

7
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:35,583
'lt doesn't matter whether
the one making us play..

8
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:38,060
..is a friend or a foe.'

9
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:45,032
'He needn't even be someone we know'

10
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,700
'This story is about two
such unrelated persons'

11
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:57,075
You look like a kidnapper.

12
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:02,948
My money..
- They'll pay you. Go there.

13
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:09,818
Who are they? Why can't you give me?

14
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,862
Do you want money or logic?
- l want money.

15
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:46,560
Why did you bring me here?

16
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:48,527
The one to give the
money is inside. Move on.

17
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,469
Come this way.

18
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:34,440
He is running away!

19
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:00,602
He escaped!
- What do we tell boss now?

20
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:03,764
He isn't going to return.
We'll say he's dead.

21
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,202
Boss, the job is done.

22
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:42,906
Brothers and sisters!

23
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:46,707
Oh, no sisters here!

24
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:49,247
Brothers and more brothers!

25
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:52,219
Today is a festival offer for you all!

26
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:56,149
Simple! l'll narrate a story.
lf anyone can listen to it..

27
00:07:56,493 --> 00:08:01,192
..patiently, l'll provide
him all his drink free! Free!

28
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,529
Liquor free?! He's mad!

29
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:09,801
l'll hear your story, bro!
- l will! - l will!

30
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,999
Hey, you all shut up!

31
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,107
l am the only one to listen to
anything spoken in this area!

32
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,374
l'll smite your throat!
Shut up and sit down !

33
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:24,780
Bearer, come here!

34
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,824
A whisky bottle, two sodas,
a tandoori kabab..

35
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,859
..one bheja fry, another dish..

36
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:33,326
Hey!
- Do you want something too, bro?

37
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:37,989
First listen to the terms and
conditions! l'll tell the full story..

38
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:41,737
..and ask a question at the end.
lf you don't answer that..

39
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,740
You don't know how smart l am!
l can count the stars..

40
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:49,535
..l know whether the hen
is first or the egg is..

41
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,179
l can answer any question.
You go and get the stuff!

42
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:54,715
Now..
- Bro, let me get this first.

43
00:08:55,085 --> 00:09:01,320
ls your story full of
knives and gory action..

44
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:05,827
..or is it full of
emotion and sentiment?

45
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:08,420
lt is neither. Mine
is a different story.

46
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:12,633
ls there comedy in your story?
- Full of it!

47
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:17,503
Any fights in it?
- My story starts with a fight!

48
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:32,384
You are done for!

49
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,253
Even l can't hear your words.
Not that way..

50
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:46,558
Venkatesa!

51
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,828
Let's shout the name together.

52
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:53,833
Venkatesa!

53
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:57,372
Brother!

54
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:03,074
So you are here!

55
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:05,111
Why do you shout so loud? Gone mad?

56
00:10:05,622 --> 00:10:07,556
He got the vehicle
repaired but refuses to pay.

57
00:10:07,624 --> 00:10:09,251
And he beat up too!

58
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:13,894
This man looks easy and soft.
He can't say so.

59
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:15,089
You are mistaken.

60
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,290
He heard it right.

61
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:22,498
Bro, you have so much
support and a nice car.

62
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,136
Why do you want to keep our money?

63
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:29,072
Do you know who you ask
money of? You know who l am?

64
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,677
Ask anyone in this area and
they'll tell you my name..

65
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:33,874
..my phone number, my address..

66
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:35,541
..they'll tell you how dangerous l am.

67
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:39,580
Get this. You won't
get a pie! Get lost!

68
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,522
Uncle!
- No letters for you.

69
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,852
l never get any. But
do you know this man?

70
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:50,960
Who is he?
- What a question? He is world famous!

71
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,631
Do you know his address at least?
- No.

72
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,604
Or his phone number?
- l don't know him or his number.

73
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,834
Do you know any single
detail about this man?

74
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:03,037
No, l don't. l have a
lot of work. l've to go.

75
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:05,376
He doesn't know about you !
Out with the money now!

76
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:06,971
How dare you speak to bro like that?!

77
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:09,849
l'll see how you won't pay us!

78
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:12,079
He beat me hard!

79
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,382
How dare you !

80
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,558
l caught him! Beat him up!

81
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:12,704
Bro, l can't stand this! He
is targeting me all the time.

82
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,815
Bro, take him out of the gang!

83
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:16,680
Stop your useless discussions!

84
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:30,562
Why do you attach him one
after another? ls this a game?

85
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:45,303
Attack him all at once!

86
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:47,744
C'mon ! C'mon !

87
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:50,218
What are you waiting for?
Go and beat him!

88
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,412
How can l? See how fast he is!

89
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:57,949
Hey, wait. Don't run !

90
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:01,928
Hey! Don't leave me here!

91
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:06,468
The fools, just ran away!

92
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,532
Why do you beat me, bro?

93
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,135
Why slap again?
- l'll skin you !

94
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:16,143
What is my mistake? l
asked you if you knew me.

95
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:19,037
You should have said you
don't know me. Why hit me?

96
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:23,414
All you want is money, right?
Take them. Here!

97
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,747
Get lost now!

98
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:42,360
Venki, give me the keys!
l have to go out.

99
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:45,038
Nothing doing! l've got to go myself.
- Please!

100
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:48,042
My American girlfriend is
about to chat on facebook.

101
00:13:48,144 --> 00:13:50,510
l will go and exchange
some sweet nothings!

102
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:53,776
You have an American
girlfriend on facebook!

103
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,080
l am to believe that?
- You have to!

104
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:59,153
Love is beyond colors and countries!

105
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:01,722
All you need to have
is a caring heart.

106
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:06,056
Nonsense! His profile has an
actor's face and not his own.

107
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,557
That girl thinks he is
a star and is misled.

108
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:12,528
How dare you bring down
the value of an actor?

109
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:15,327
What will the girl do
when she realizes the truth?

110
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,305
She's going to bash his brains out!
- Shut up!

111
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,533
Girls are like that.

112
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,643
We need to hold on like
puppies till they consent..

113
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:26,806
..and after that they will
pardon any nonsense we do.

114
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:32,150
You skinny fellow! What is
important is whether the girl..

115
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:34,049
..is snared and not how it is done.

116
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,354
You are of a different type!
- lt is you that is different.

117
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:41,196
Just see all the beauty around.

118
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:47,100
Don't you feel attracted
to not even one of them?

119
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,730
lt is you who called them 'pieces'.

120
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:54,143
l want a girl and not a 'piece'.

121
00:14:54,844 --> 00:14:56,141
You know how a girl should be?
- How?

122
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,672
The heart should melt like
ice at one sight of her.

123
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:02,548
A good tune should hum in the air.

124
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:10,384
'A star from the sky has
descended for me today'

125
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:18,600
'A star from the sky has
descended for me today'

126
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:23,104
Hey, your phone is ringing.
- Hello!

127
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:28,373
You mean, corrupt,
lowly, downtrodden people!

128
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,344
The lines in your palm and
your fate are about to change!

129
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:33,745
Your poor lives are about to
transform and lightened up!

130
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,751
The wheels of
revolution are arriving fast!

131
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:40,583
The wheels of the
divine chariot are coming!

132
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:43,414
This man is more gas
and less substance.

133
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:49,493
Men are of four types
- the first has time but no money..

134
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,424
He is of that type!

135
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,469
The second type has
money but no time..

136
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,662
..like movie stars.

137
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:58,805
l am getting late.
Tell your brother to open the door.

138
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:01,843
You should be patient.
He got some customers at last.

139
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:03,373
Shouldn't he run his business?

140
00:16:03,513 --> 00:16:05,174
What business it is
to brainwash people?

141
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:08,212
The fourth type is the one that
l am going to create in you all..

142
00:16:08,518 --> 00:16:10,884
Lots of time and loads of money!

143
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:14,081
You can have it all! All
you need to do is this..

144
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,149
Should l tell you what it is?
- What other option have we?!

145
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:21,593
First you all pay ten
thousand each and join this scheme.

146
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,696
And then get three
others to enroll in it.

147
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:27,831
You get to retain 10
percent of their deposit.

148
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:30,132
They will enroll 3 others in turn.

149
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,106
You will get 10 percent
of their deposits too.

150
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,938
ln a short span,
without your knowing it..

151
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,445
..you'll earn thousands,
millions and much more.

152
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,740
You'll buy mansions!
- All is well! All is well!

153
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:44,512
Did you understand or shall l repeat?

154
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:46,622
No, sir. We got it completely.

155
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:49,154
Let us go. l am feeling feverish.

156
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:51,952
Ok, go running and come
back with your deposits!

157
00:16:52,028 --> 00:16:53,154
l'll change your lives!

158
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:57,060
Let's escape!

159
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:01,234
Why is the entire market here?

160
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:10,608
'Your nest is lost!
Your heart is broken !'

161
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:15,675
This way!
- 'O dove, who did all this?'

162
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:18,844
His fuse seems to have blown !
What a lament?!

163
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:23,552
You torture has no end!
They are unable to bear it!

164
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:26,760
Nephew, outsiders are
not paying attention.

165
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:29,224
Why don't you join
the scheme at least?

166
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:32,024
Even my friends have
stopped coming here due to you.

167
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,762
Try enrolling him if you want.
- Srinu !

168
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,568
Just shut up or l'll bash you !

169
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:40,506
l must get three and they
must get three each in turn !

170
00:17:40,843 --> 00:17:42,834
You think you are
some magician, you fool!

171
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:44,841
Cut the line and shut up!

172
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:46,239
You were saying something, uncle.

173
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:48,043
Just enquiring if all is ok.
- l'm fine.

174
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:49,549
You are very caring, uncle.

175
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:52,516
l am already late for office.
Pay this electricity bill.

176
00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:54,249
Ok, father.
- Thanks, bye.

177
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,688
Bro-in-law, how can
you be late to office?

178
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,189
You need to be more
dedicated and sincere.

179
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:20,074
'A star from the sky has
descended for me today'

180
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:29,082
'A star from the sky has
descended for me today'

181
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:33,656
What a beauty? Just one
hug before the kiss of death !

182
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,775
Take it off!

183
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:01,341
No

184
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:08,015
No, don't do it!

185
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,691
Don't give up till you
know your true weight!

186
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,696
l'll give you as
many coins as you want!

187
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,961
lf l run short, l'll beg
around for more coins.

188
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,694
Sorry!

189
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,436
Hey, why are you
bothered if l offer her coins?

190
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,065
She is a girl and no 'piece'!
- What is the difference?

191
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:31,474
Oh.. the melting point
of ice! And the song!

192
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,174
You time is good. Go and speak to her.

193
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:36,548
Shall l?
- Yes, go on.

194
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,751
She was here a moment ago.
Where did she vanish?

195
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:46,094
You fool! With you
around how can we expect..

196
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:47,695
..something good to
happen in around a mile?!

197
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,388
But you never indicated
your feelings for her.

198
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:55,768
You spoiled the first impression !
- l'll set it right.

199
00:20:58,307 --> 00:20:59,934
Did you see the girl who
was on the weighing machine?

200
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:09,376
This is the joker.

201
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:15,423
Useless cards!

202
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,382
lt's no use. l drop off!

203
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:21,794
Why are you irritated?
- He is distracted!

204
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:26,197
What's the matter?
- l saw a girl yesterday.

205
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:29,604
She is just like the
girl of my dreams.

206
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:35,235
She is beauty and
womanhood personified.

207
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,140
Did you get her address?

208
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:40,907
l wanted to but that
idiot spoiled the show.

209
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:45,810
'Days were passing by as usual'

210
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:48,917
'l was worried a little
that l may not see her again'

211
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:50,648
'l wasn't my own self.'

212
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:54,455
'After a few days..'

213
00:22:44,914 --> 00:22:46,006
What happened, bro?

214
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:49,014
She is the girl l told
you about few days ago.

215
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:50,982
What do you wait for?
Go and talk to her.

216
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:55,819
Go now!
- Hello! Madam, l am..

217
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:04,361
Madam, l am Venkatesam.. That mall..

218
00:23:08,237 --> 00:23:11,229
Damn it! Why did she
go away like that?

219
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,468
She stared as if we dacoits.
Didn't even say a word!

220
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,805
These rich ones are arrogant.

221
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,841
We'll set that right.

222
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:24,050
A Mercedes!
- Nice car. ls it hers?

223
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:26,746
She came out of it.
- Nice one!

224
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,719
Looks like automatic gears..

225
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:36,125
Hello!
- Hey, a 2010 s-class Benz..

226
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:37,323
..how much would its
front mirror cost?

227
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,924
4 or 5 thousand..
- 4 or 5?

228
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:41,627
Approx 5..
- Ok.

229
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:46,203
Get me a pen and paper.
- Why would l have them?

230
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,105
Ask some idiot and get them..

231
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:51,137
Hello!

232
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:54,674
Excuse me!
- You mean, me?

233
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:57,943
l'm addressing you..
- Seems to be some agent.

234
00:23:58,087 --> 00:23:59,554
Yes?
- Do you have a paper and a pen?

235
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:00,917
Sure! Why not?

236
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:07,119
Here you go. Thanks dude..

237
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:09,958
Dude?! l am a software engineer!

238
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:13,831
l have a lot of qualifications!

239
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:16,830
Where do you work, sir?
- l used to, some time ago.

240
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:19,339
Now l am jobless and looking for one.

241
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:23,400
Why so? They say that
even a fool can be trained..

242
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,877
..and land a decent software job.

243
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:28,984
But your story is reverse!
- Do you know what software is?

244
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:30,210
Do you know anything about technology?

245
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,254
About science? Or anything at all?!

246
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,054
Wait! l am innocent!

247
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,682
Oh god.

248
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:18,598
'Sorry! My name is Venkatesh..'

249
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:21,396
'..your windscreen was broken
when l was reversing my car.'

250
00:25:21,537 --> 00:25:23,971
'lf you call me, l will
bear the repair expenses'

251
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:27,473
'My number is 9885547565'

252
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,138
Hello, my name is Anjali.

253
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,108
lt was my car that was
parked in the cellar.

254
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:34,507
l have to meet you urgently.

255
00:25:36,685 --> 00:25:38,812
The concept is fine.
Let's see what she says.

256
00:25:41,557 --> 00:25:43,047
This may be ill omen. Take care.

257
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:58,438
Hey! This is the third time
you are watching in slow motion !

258
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,475
l can't take it any longer.
Go and talk to her.

259
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,511
l am not good at English.
But you can manage it.

260
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,638
C'mon. - l don't know
which language to tell you in.

261
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,316
She knows that you
broke her windscreen.

262
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:12,080
She is going to have you bashed up.

263
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:14,781
lf she sees me with you, l won't
be spared either. l won't come!

264
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:17,551
Nothing of that sort!
- Let me go! - C'mon !

265
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,355
Listen to me. l never
spoke to ladies directly!

266
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:21,554
lt was only on facebook!

267
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:29,137
What are you doing here?
- Not me! lt is him.

268
00:26:31,073 --> 00:26:32,631
Madam, what happened was..

269
00:26:37,913 --> 00:26:40,939
You had a lot of
problems because of us.

270
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:45,080
His slang at the mall
must have miffed you..

271
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:46,447
That was so embarrassing!

272
00:26:46,922 --> 00:26:49,413
And today your car
got damaged due to us.

273
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:52,419
We are really sorry.
- Please don't be sorry.

274
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,894
ln fact l was happy that
you left your number there.

275
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:57,363
You know.. l'd bet
that not one in hundred..

276
00:26:57,499 --> 00:27:00,627
..would be magnanimous
to do such a normal thing.

277
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:04,672
Actually, not
understanding speed English !

278
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,808
You speak word by word
and he'll understand!

279
00:27:09,111 --> 00:27:11,909
l mean that you are very great.

280
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:14,581
The glass may be
broken but l am glad..

281
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,380
..to meet a nice person
like you. That's all l want.

282
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,782
l'm really happy.
- Tell me what the glass costs.

283
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,153
l'll pay you.
- Please, drop the money part.

284
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:26,159
That's not done. lt
is my duty to pay you.

285
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:27,956
No, l won't accept money from you.

286
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,724
Ms. Anjali! You
shouldn't say like that.

287
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,533
He's very upset the
he broke your glass.

288
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:34,727
He is repairing the screen
of every car at the garage.

289
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,804
He soul won't be at peace
if you don't take the money.

290
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,772
How much is it?
- Just one lakh !

291
00:27:45,948 --> 00:27:47,939
But you said it was
just five thousand!

292
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:51,110
She is trying to fleece you. lt
shouldn't be more than 3 thousand.

293
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:53,946
Any problem?

294
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,656
l may find it hard to
pay so much money at once..

295
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:02,755
lf you consent, we will
keep meeting like this..

296
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:07,826
..and l will pay you some
amount each time. Please!

297
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:10,604
You want me to meet you
again and again. Okay!

298
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,938
What about the bill now?
- Shut up!

299
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:19,574
Ok, we'll take your leave.

300
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:22,046
A friend is about to meet me here.

301
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:24,012
You can please go ahead.
- Ok.

302
00:28:24,152 --> 00:28:25,517
Ok. Bye!
- Bye!

303
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:27,845
Venkatesh !

304
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,390
She may ask us to pay the bill.
l don't have a penny!

305
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,755
Can you come to the
Art Gallery auditorium..

306
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:36,591
..at 10.30 tomorrow morning?

307
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:39,192
10.30..
- Please!

308
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,896
Let me go!
- Stop it!

309
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:46,804
This is the problem
with these drunkards!

310
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:50,307
They get drunk and start fighting!
l hate such people.

311
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:54,814
Hey, think about them later.
First attend to our matter.

312
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:58,151
Carry on your story.
- Where did we pause?

313
00:28:59,454 --> 00:29:01,012
Anjali asked you to
come to the auditorium.

314
00:29:01,256 --> 00:29:04,714
Bro, tell me one thing.
Normally one would meet..

315
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:09,786
..in a park or a movie hall.
Why this auditorium?

316
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:11,728
l don't get her sense of location !

317
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,996
That is what me and
Pandu labored over to no use.

318
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:19,535
Anyways, l went to the
auditorium the next day.

319
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,108
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen !

320
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:23,200
We welcome you all to
this seminar conducted by..

321
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:27,406
..the wishmaker's foundation
about goodness in society.

322
00:29:27,783 --> 00:29:30,115
One word about wishmaker's foundation.

323
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:34,985
One may have many dreams but what..

324
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:38,149
..if death approaches
without them being fulfilled?

325
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,659
What if one faces untimely death?

326
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:45,164
The aim of this foundation is to
fulfill the wishes of such people.

327
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,094
For example, the
..5-year kid has cancer.

328
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,798
She wishes to meet
megastar Chiranjeevi once.

329
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:53,505
We arranged for that to happen.

330
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:06,151
The boy has a brain tumor and
wants to become a policeman.

331
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:09,085
We took the DGP's
permission for this..

332
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:12,991
..and made him the inspector
of a police station for a day.

333
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:15,091
We have done many such things.

334
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,628
Now l request Ms. Anjali to take over.

335
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,537
Good morning, everybody.
Before we start the seminar..

336
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:27,498
..l have a small
question for all of you.

337
00:30:27,943 --> 00:30:31,572
You unintentionally caused the
windscreen of a car to break.

338
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:35,581
The car owner isn't there at the
spot. - This is coming our way!

339
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:39,984
No one else witnessed it too.
How many of you..

340
00:30:40,122 --> 00:30:42,386
..would own it up, agree to pay and..

341
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:44,549
..post a note with your phone number?

342
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,626
You may even doubt if
such a person exists!

343
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,596
There is one. Right here.

344
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:55,025
Please welcome Mr.
Venkatesam on to the dais.

345
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,898
Mr. Venkatesam, please
come on to the stage.

346
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,439
Mr. Venkatesam, l request you
to come on to the stage, please!

347
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:11,376
'Mr. Raja, l receive
this award for you'

348
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,853
'l know that you are here. l saw you'

349
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:26,897
He is the hero and she
the heroine of some movie!

350
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:30,263
These idiots are watching
it as if it is a hit movie!

351
00:31:30,372 --> 00:31:34,172
Now l request Venkatesam
to speak a few lines..

352
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,244
..regarding goodness and humanity.

353
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:39,575
l don't know much about those things.
- Please!

354
00:31:42,017 --> 00:31:44,850
Being good and human is
very important to society.

355
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:48,854
They are like fuel to a car engine.

356
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,723
lf one pours petrol into the engine,
the car is in condition.

357
00:31:54,396 --> 00:31:57,957
lf we use kerosene instead,
it gets damaged..

358
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,234
..has to be taken to a garage
and lot of money spent on it.

359
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:06,640
ln the same way goodness
in society makes it human.

360
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,668
Without goodness human values die.

361
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,276
And society gets rotten as a result.

362
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,083
Thanks. You came here
despite your busy schedule.

363
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,285
Today is Telangana bandh !

364
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:29,521
What else?

365
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,497
Ok, let's meet later.

366
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:36,934
When will that moment come?
- Some time..

367
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:47,074
What is this man doing here?

368
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:53,120
Hey, why did you break it?

369
00:32:53,822 --> 00:32:55,255
Who are you?
- l'll tell that later.

370
00:32:55,357 --> 00:32:56,847
First tell me why you broke the glass.

371
00:32:59,327 --> 00:33:02,160
This concept very complicated.
You don't know, baby.

372
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:03,821
lt is something good, bad and ugly..

373
00:33:03,932 --> 00:33:05,797
lf you are angry with
someone go and hit him.

374
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,198
Why do you damage property?

375
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:10,932
lt has something to
do with the movies..

376
00:33:11,273 --> 00:33:12,399
..it is about love for her..

377
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,641
Teacher!
- Why is he coming here?

378
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:27,819
Teacher, what a concept you invented!
- Don't cry.

379
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,551
This is not crying but tears of joy!

380
00:33:30,692 --> 00:33:32,626
l've been trying since 20
years to win over a girl..

381
00:33:32,727 --> 00:33:35,696
..but no girl even looks at me.
- What?!

382
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,865
Don't be surprised.
But now that's past.

383
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:39,896
l am now implementing
the idea you conceived.

384
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:45,405
l netted a Skoda girl and a
Santro girl using the trick.

385
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,632
Now l am trying it on the Ford baby.

386
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,769
What is all this breaking?
Do you know this man?

387
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:54,006
Know me? What do you
know about my boss?

388
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:57,943
l am a dedicated
disciple and he is my teacher.

389
00:33:58,053 --> 00:33:59,611
Why narrate all that now, bro?!

390
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:01,655
He re-kindled the
light in my dead life..

391
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:05,351
..your creativity has to be
showcased to the entire world!

392
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,360
Calm down now, my friend.

393
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,895
You deserve all praise.

394
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,925
Madam, my boss gave me a superb idea.

395
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:15,036
lf you want to impress a girl,
all you need to do is..

396
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:18,970
..to break her car glass and
tell her it was by accident..

397
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:21,200
..write a note to that
effect with phone number..

398
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,436
..and put it in the car.

399
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:25,069
Any girl would fall for that trick.

400
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,240
Did the Benz car thing you
tried in the cellar work out?

401
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,683
You seem to be in a good mood.
We will take care of you..

402
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:41,290
l will give you all the details..

403
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,633
Anjali, please.
- Aren't you ashamed?

404
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:55,504
What a drama! l must be
blamed for believing you.

405
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:56,668
Anjali, please listen to me.

406
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:59,405
What should l listen? You made
me an idiot and played a game.

407
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:02,607
The mistake is mine and
not yours. l made friends..

408
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:04,184
..with an illiterate,
third rate labourer..

409
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:07,550
Don't say that! You may
call me a laborer, a cheat..

410
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:11,251
..or anything you please.
But don't call me illiterate!

411
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,554
Why not? Are you an lAS?

412
00:35:13,662 --> 00:35:15,653
What did you study?
- Completed Engineering recently.

413
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:17,264
What is your rank in the
entrance exam? - What?

414
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,593
What was your rank
in the entrance exam?

415
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,759
l got no rank. lt was a donation seat.

416
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:25,496
You paid donation. But l stood
first in the state in the 1998 exam.

417
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:27,837
Some new story? l don't believe you.

418
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:29,705
Won't you believe me?! No?!

419
00:35:43,692 --> 00:35:45,523
'Exam results announced'

420
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,491
'ln the Engineering
division Venkatesam stood first'

421
00:35:49,431 --> 00:35:51,023
'Exam results announced'

422
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:53,862
'ln the Engineering division
Venkatesam is state first'

423
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:07,572
'Victory is certain.
Proceed forward without fear'

424
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,484
First of all, congratulations
for securing the first rank.

425
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,784
Thanks. - What is the
reason behind your success?

426
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:19,052
lt is obviously my effort!

427
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:21,788
This is the first time in
history that one got full 200 marks.

428
00:36:21,896 --> 00:36:25,161
Did you expect this?
- l answered all questions correctly.

429
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,097
How many hours did you
spend studying daily?

430
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:31,194
The hours spent in not important.
One must grasp the subject.

431
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:34,571
Anyways, l used to
study for 15-16 hours.

432
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:36,371
What do you want to become in future.

433
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:47,281
l want to invent a car that runs
on water and serve my country.

434
00:36:50,024 --> 00:36:53,152
That year about a
million students took the exam.

435
00:36:53,728 --> 00:36:55,195
l was the topper among them.

436
00:36:56,397 --> 00:37:00,629
l couldn't complete the
course due to financial problems.

437
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:04,231
And not because l am illiterate.
l don't normally..

438
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:05,703
..tell this to others. But you
called me an illiterate fool.

439
00:37:06,908 --> 00:37:08,068
l felt bad at that.

440
00:37:08,176 --> 00:37:11,839
Yes, people like you may
not get sufficient marks..

441
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:15,541
..but pay lots of money to
get engineering degrees.

442
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:18,917
But we end up
repairing engines like this.

443
00:37:20,688 --> 00:37:22,280
l had some feeling for
you when l saw you first.

444
00:37:23,057 --> 00:37:25,184
l yearned to meet
you and to talk to you.

445
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,988
That's why l did all this.

446
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:30,994
lt was only because of
my wish to talk to you.

447
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:34,961
The mistake was mine. l
will somehow pay you..

448
00:37:35,103 --> 00:37:37,298
..the one lakh rupees that l owe you.

449
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,939
l will not appear
before you again in life.

450
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:41,635
Forgive me!

451
00:37:56,925 --> 00:38:00,258
Madam, will you have lunch?
- No.

452
00:38:00,795 --> 00:38:04,322
Why do you look crestfallen?
- Nothing.

453
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:25,109
That part costs 2000.

454
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:27,448
l will get it from
somewhere and fit it. - Thanks.

455
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:45,705
Tell her that we don't
repair such costly cars here.

456
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:48,105
Tell her that there is a
Benz showroom in road 10.

457
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,076
l did not come for that.
- ls it the money, then?

458
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:53,581
l can't pay a lakh in one go, madam.

459
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:56,582
l will arrange in a month or two.
- l don't want the money.

460
00:38:56,951 --> 00:38:58,145
What is it that you want?

461
00:38:58,286 --> 00:39:00,982
l'm really sorry. l
spoke hastily the other day.

462
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,220
l shouldn't have spoken like that.
- lt is ok.

463
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:06,891
You have right to
speak whatever you want.

464
00:39:07,362 --> 00:39:10,854
Venkatesam, can we be friends?

465
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,730
Please!

466
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:46,631
''Do you know it?''

467
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:54,468
''Do you know it?''

468
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:03,912
''Do you know about this
commotion within our hearts''

469
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:07,078
''Do you know what is causing
these ripples in our hearts?''

470
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:12,522
''What are these sweet
nothings exchanged between our eyes''

471
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:15,994
''ls there any end to the
dreams they are showing us?''

472
00:41:14,455 --> 00:41:22,123
''After l saw you once.. the
entire world appears in a new light''

473
00:41:22,764 --> 00:41:30,068
''You showed me the
beauty of the world''

474
00:41:40,782 --> 00:41:44,980
''l am your eyes and you, my vision''

475
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,646
''Let us both behold
the beauty of our love''

476
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:02,327
''Do you know about this
commotion within our hearts''

477
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:06,396
''Do you know what is causing
these ripples in our hearts?''

478
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:23,322
So far so good. What next?

479
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:27,990
l understood that
Anjali was in love with me.

480
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,458
These girls are fools. They
have beauty and lots of money..

481
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,366
..but fall in love with an
idiot like you. Nonsense!

482
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,804
Hey you !
- Calm down !

483
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:41,603
Take a peg! Take a peg!

484
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:43,069
Tell me what happened next.

485
00:42:54,088 --> 00:42:57,751
Give me this.
- 300. - Here.

486
00:42:58,092 --> 00:42:59,457
You want any message attached?

487
00:43:00,928 --> 00:43:03,556
To Venkatesam.. with love.. Anjali.

488
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:09,061
Hey Anjali!
- Hey Rekha!

489
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,296
What are you doing here?

490
00:43:10,438 --> 00:43:12,804
You enter my area and
ask me this question !

491
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,866
What are you doing in this area?

492
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,742
l came to meet Venkatesam.. a friend.

493
00:43:21,282 --> 00:43:23,113
How come that
useless guy is your friend?

494
00:43:23,251 --> 00:43:26,982
No, he is a very good person. You
may be referring to someone else.

495
00:43:27,922 --> 00:43:31,050
He works at the mechanic shed,
right? He is a bastard!

496
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:34,557
Rekha, you don't know
him fully. Not only you..

497
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:39,860
..even l
misunderstood in the beginning.

498
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:41,662
What is there in him to understand?

499
00:43:41,802 --> 00:43:45,795
l don't know how to tell you.
He is an extraordinary person.

500
00:43:46,174 --> 00:43:48,165
Too intelligent.. a genius!

501
00:43:48,276 --> 00:43:52,610
l don't believe it.
- Won't you ! Won't you !

502
00:44:07,828 --> 00:44:10,319
This is Andhra Jyoti..
the Hindu.. Eenadu..

503
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:11,823
See for yourself!

504
00:44:13,034 --> 00:44:17,198
'Govt college student tops'

505
00:44:17,805 --> 00:44:21,434
lt is wrong on your part
to speak lightly of him.

506
00:44:21,776 --> 00:44:25,268
He topped the million students
who took the exam that year.

507
00:44:25,846 --> 00:44:27,108
One minute!

508
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,349
Read them!

509
00:44:40,695 --> 00:44:44,222
'Exam results erroneous.
Actual toppers announced'

510
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:52,469
'Exam results upside
down due to computer error'

511
00:44:54,308 --> 00:44:56,970
What is all this?
- What actually happened is..

512
00:45:19,267 --> 00:45:22,430
What is this? l don't seem
to know even one of them!

513
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:26,773
There are so many red, blue
and other balls in a bag..

514
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:32,172
..what is the probability
of picking up a red ball?

515
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,913
l seem to have heard this
probability thing somewhere..

516
00:45:42,757 --> 00:45:45,726
These are fools expecting
to pick balls and cards..

517
00:45:45,893 --> 00:45:47,451
..and trying to become engineers!

518
00:45:47,595 --> 00:45:48,687
Last one hour!

519
00:45:48,963 --> 00:45:51,557
Venkatesam, this
won't work out for me!

520
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,432
Madam!
- What is it? - l want to leave.

521
00:45:57,104 --> 00:45:58,696
That can't be done.
- Why?

522
00:45:58,806 --> 00:46:00,296
According to the rules..

523
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:02,939
..we can let you out
only in the last half hour.

524
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,737
ls this an exam hall or a jail?

525
00:46:05,913 --> 00:46:09,349
lf you create trouble, the
policemen will enter the hall..

526
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:13,682
..will take you out and
then take you to jail!

527
00:46:14,922 --> 00:46:19,325
Why call them in? Just
20 min more! l'll wait.

528
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,623
'That year for the first
time OMR sheet was introduced'

529
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,830
'Normally one would have to
tick one of the 4 options'

530
00:46:26,967 --> 00:46:28,662
l have to pass the time somehow..

531
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,098
'But this guy
darkened all the options'

532
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:35,869
'That software checked
only if the correct answer..'

533
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:42,142
'..was selected and
ignored the others'

534
00:46:42,817 --> 00:46:46,082
'Since one of the four
options has to be correct..'

535
00:46:46,187 --> 00:46:48,451
'..and since he
circled all the options..;

536
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:52,754
'..the program's logic
failed and gave him a full score'

537
00:46:53,627 --> 00:46:56,221
And all newspapers announced that..

538
00:46:56,364 --> 00:46:57,888
..he got the first rank in the state.

539
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:01,362
But he didn't pass even a
single subject in the board exam..

540
00:47:01,836 --> 00:47:05,067
..that created a doubt and
the matter was investigated

541
00:47:05,206 --> 00:47:07,401
..and the truth was revealed.
The next day..

542
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:10,101
..all newspapers
published the real story.

543
00:47:10,878 --> 00:47:13,073
The fox-faced guy!

544
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,807
Hey, it seems you aren't
the first ranker after all!

545
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:16,473
You said you spent 16
hours a day with books..

546
00:47:16,617 --> 00:47:17,948
You claimed to
deserve this achievement..

547
00:47:18,052 --> 00:47:19,451
..and left no stone
unturned to bask in the glory!

548
00:47:20,321 --> 00:47:22,949
And you claimed you'd
invent a car that runs on water!

549
00:47:23,057 --> 00:47:25,184
Now speak up! Talk!

550
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,574
lsn't he a topper, then?

551
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:44,743
O God! He stood last
in the exams that year.

552
00:47:44,845 --> 00:47:48,337
With negative marking,
his score was minus 400.

553
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:53,144
No one scored such
low marks in the past!

554
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:02,888
Hey, keep the place neat
and clean like a mirror.

555
00:48:02,997 --> 00:48:07,730
Why did you throw
that there? Pick it up.

556
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:13,131
What is this oil? What
do you think of my shed?

557
00:48:13,274 --> 00:48:14,901
lt should be neat like me!

558
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,098
Anjali, l wanted to
tell you the truth..

559
00:48:43,204 --> 00:48:44,603
..but didn't know how to start!

560
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,839
Are you human? How
many times will you lie?!

561
00:48:48,976 --> 00:48:50,807
Anjali, please. Try to understand me.

562
00:48:50,911 --> 00:48:53,402
Shut up!
- Anjali! - Shut up!

563
00:48:53,714 --> 00:48:56,046
Anjali, please!
- Don't utter a word!

564
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:58,084
Anjali!
- Not a word! - Anjali!

565
00:49:19,073 --> 00:49:23,874
'You've caused my
heart to become heavier''

566
00:49:25,446 --> 00:49:30,042
''You've made tears to come in my eyes''

567
00:49:30,784 --> 00:49:36,814
''Now you are walking
away from me, friend''

568
00:49:37,157 --> 00:49:40,320
''O my friend''

569
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,719
For the first time in life l got
the feeling that l made a mistake.

570
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:47,057
Her parting looks are
haunting me like a nightmare.

571
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:51,034
l tried a lot to meet
her and talk to her.

572
00:49:51,138 --> 00:49:53,265
But she kept moving away from me.

573
00:50:00,781 --> 00:50:05,809
''Your memories
follow me like a shadow''

574
00:50:07,154 --> 00:50:12,148
''l wished to be part of your life''

575
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:18,357
''l am unable to bear this torture''

576
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:24,928
''Come to me and entwine me''

577
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:28,039
''My beloved''

578
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:31,134
Normally l should be angry with him.

579
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,675
But l am feeling hurt instead.

580
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:36,882
His memories follow me
wherever l go and whatever l do.

581
00:50:37,217 --> 00:50:41,085
l am afraid that my anger
may vanish and l forgive him.

582
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:45,252
At times you speak of anger
and later about being hurt..

583
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:47,550
..l don't really
understand what your problem is.

584
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:51,397
ls it important that one is educated?

585
00:50:51,765 --> 00:50:54,598
He may not be an engineer. lsn't
it fine if he is just a good man?

586
00:50:54,902 --> 00:50:57,928
You are finished and out!

587
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:33,306
l don't mind Anjali
scolding or hitting me.

588
00:51:34,241 --> 00:51:38,974
But her ignoring me like
this is burning me down.

589
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:41,673
Give me your glass!
- Calm down !

590
00:51:44,952 --> 00:51:48,718
Bro, l am not getting the
kick despite drinking so much..

591
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,288
..is the liquor less
effective or am l more emotional?

592
00:51:53,127 --> 00:51:55,994
This fool must have
got adulterated stuff!

593
00:51:56,797 --> 00:51:58,526
lt is you who said once that..

594
00:51:58,666 --> 00:52:01,362
..once girls like you
they forgive everything.

595
00:52:01,502 --> 00:52:04,699
Why does she then turn
away from me and ignore?

596
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,863
Her phone is always switched off.

597
00:52:08,008 --> 00:52:12,308
Try calling her landline. The
landline is never switched off!

598
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,956
Anjali, please don't cut the call.

599
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:36,127
You need not speak.
Please listen to what l say.

600
00:52:37,037 --> 00:52:39,904
l never wanted anyone in
my life like l wanted you.

601
00:52:40,808 --> 00:52:42,366
l cannot live without you.

602
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,409
l will take any punishment from you.

603
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:54,819
Please tell me once
that you have forgiven me.

604
00:52:56,156 --> 00:52:58,317
Speak up once! Please!

605
00:53:11,472 --> 00:53:13,940
Who is this guy, my dear?
- No one.

606
00:53:14,074 --> 00:53:16,269
l heard it all, my dear.
Tell me who he is!

607
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:20,177
There is no one, father.
- Tell me who he is!

608
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:25,276
Venkatesam. - Where does
he stay and what does he do?

609
00:53:25,652 --> 00:53:26,949
He is a mechanic downtown.

610
00:53:27,521 --> 00:53:29,921
A mechanic! A mechanic!

611
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:33,652
Konda! Hey Konda!

612
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:37,894
There is some guy called Venkatesam.

613
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,930
He is a mechanic downtown
and is calling up my daughter.

614
00:53:41,068 --> 00:53:42,296
He is calling up at
midnight and teasing her!

615
00:53:42,402 --> 00:53:44,336
He wasn't teasing me!

616
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,132
You are naOve, my child.

617
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,274
Konda!

618
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:51,109
He has to shiver at the thought of
uttering her name from tomorrow.

619
00:53:51,211 --> 00:53:57,411
Bash him up and thrown him
down the gutter! Let's go now!

620
00:53:57,551 --> 00:53:59,416
Father, please listen to me!
- Step aside!

621
00:54:01,722 --> 00:54:02,848
Please don't harm Venkatesam.

622
00:54:02,956 --> 00:54:04,685
You are a naOve girl.
l'll settle the matter!

623
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:06,623
Father, listen to me.
- Step aside, my girl!

624
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:11,561
l am in love with Venkatesam!

625
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:14,898
l am in love with him, father!

626
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:18,836
Love! With a mechanic!

627
00:54:18,939 --> 00:54:23,638
l don't know all that,
father. l like him.

628
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:29,673
Don't ask me the reasons.
l like him a lot.

629
00:54:32,586 --> 00:54:35,817
l didn't tell him this fact till now.

630
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:38,121
lt is to you l am
revealing this first.

631
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:43,622
Before he entered my life,
it was a dull and hollow.

632
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:49,631
But after he came, each day
and moment are fresh and new.

633
00:54:50,771 --> 00:54:52,068
He added color to my life.

634
00:54:56,944 --> 00:55:02,041
You never made me feel
like a motherless girl.

635
00:55:02,816 --> 00:55:05,046
You gave me all that l wanted.

636
00:55:05,986 --> 00:55:07,954
l just ask this of you
for the last time. Please!

637
00:55:08,655 --> 00:55:10,816
l have to meet you once.

638
00:56:25,265 --> 00:56:28,359
lt seems that my daughter
and your son love each other.

639
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,770
l've come to see the matter through !

640
00:56:33,674 --> 00:56:37,405
Considering my child's education,
wealth and upbringing..

641
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:45,043
..l felt bad that she fell
in love with a mechanic.

642
00:56:45,352 --> 00:56:47,877
What are you saying, sir?
- Let me complete.

643
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:54,390
Then l realized. What do
we carry with us at birth?

644
00:56:54,928 --> 00:56:56,395
And what do we take
along with us at death?

645
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,895
All that happens between
those two events, is a dream.

646
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,794
Realizing that is true wisdom!

647
00:57:02,436 --> 00:57:06,668
Wealth, status etc come
and go in this life span.

648
00:57:07,908 --> 00:57:10,502
Who are we to object to their love?

649
00:57:11,311 --> 00:57:13,336
What else do we want
than their happiness?

650
00:57:14,281 --> 00:57:15,908
That's why l made a decision.

651
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:21,917
l came to request you to accept
my child as your daughter-in-law.

652
00:57:29,162 --> 00:57:32,996
Great news! We are lucky to get
a daughter-in-law like Anjali.

653
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:37,896
She has no mother. l raised
her with a lot of affection.

654
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:40,131
Her responsibility shall be on you.

655
00:57:40,674 --> 00:57:43,074
Be assured that we will
take good care of her.

656
00:57:43,443 --> 00:57:44,535
One more thing.

657
00:57:44,678 --> 00:57:47,943
Don't assume that this
marriage won't be traditional.

658
00:57:48,081 --> 00:57:51,312
We will get the marriage
done as per your customs.

659
00:57:51,451 --> 00:57:52,543
We are glad to hear this.
We'll do as you wish.

660
00:57:53,954 --> 00:57:57,617
Gita, go and send Anjali here.
- Anjali! - Don't shout!

661
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,850
Anjali!

662
00:58:05,198 --> 00:58:10,033
Why did you call me?
- To say sorry.

663
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:11,997
Say it!

664
00:58:12,606 --> 00:58:16,736
l'm sorry. l will never
lie to you again in life.

665
00:58:17,778 --> 00:58:19,109
Ok.. now let me go.

666
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:24,441
What is it?
- l want to hug you once. - What?!

667
00:58:24,951 --> 00:58:28,045
No chance!
- Just once! - Venkatesam!

668
00:58:29,156 --> 00:58:33,820
Let me go!
- Hold on ! - Leave me!

669
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:45,231
Brother! What is this?!

670
00:58:45,338 --> 00:58:48,102
Something got stuck in her hair.
l was removing it.

671
00:58:48,241 --> 00:58:50,141

01:01:12,619 --> 01:01:16,453
''Come early for the fun..
don't be late''

697
01:01:20,493 --> 01:01:24,554
''We'll splash the
water and have a blast''

698
01:01:24,698 --> 01:01:28,532

''Now the style is different
and even god holds a cellphone''

701
01:01:53,093 --> 01:01:57,052
''Life is a flowing river and
the one who is late loses power''

702

01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:12,635

''2012 is about to begin''

715
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:19,210
Venkatesam is dead drunk.. and
do you know what he is doing?

716
01:03:19,779 --> 01:03:21,940
How long are you going to take?
Come fast. - lt is ready!

717
01:03:22,515 --> 01:03:25,245
Take this.
- Why don't you close it properly?

718
01:03:25,352 --> 01:03:30,984
See there..
- When did you come, please come in.

719
01:03:31,124 --> 01:03:32,182
Please come and have a seat.

720
01:03:32,325 --> 01:03:37,024
l did not come to sit. l have
to tell you something important.

721
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:40,025
What is it?
- This marriage won't happen.

722
01:03:42,602 --> 01:03:46,368
Why do you say that?
- Don't ask me the reason.

723
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,935
Your son isn't
suitable for my daughter!

724
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:53,301
All that l did was for
my daughter's happiness.

725
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:57,108
But with this marriage, her
happiness will be gone forever!

726
01:03:57,484 --> 01:04:01,511
l can't do this to her. So,
please forgive me.

727
01:04:01,654 --> 01:04:03,986
lt is you who came with
the proposal yesterday.

728
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,148
Why this u-turn today?

729
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,818
Yesterday, l acted in haste.
So l ask to be forgiven.

730
01:04:08,862 --> 01:04:10,853
But this marriage can't happen.

731
01:04:11,131 --> 01:04:13,599
ls this some game?
- Don't!

732
01:04:14,534 --> 01:04:17,560
lf l start playing games,
you will suffer a lot!

733
01:04:18,505 --> 01:04:21,474
l came here to settle the matter
with dignity. Not to create trouble!

734
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:23,769
What are you blabbering?!
- Hey, stop there!

735
01:04:24,177 --> 01:04:25,974
lt is good for you that l
stick only to saying a few words.

736
01:04:26,246 --> 01:04:29,044
Don't create a situation
where l have to do something!

737
01:04:29,716 --> 01:04:32,048
Even if the entire world
comes to know of her love..

738
01:04:32,185 --> 01:04:33,709
..l can still get her married grandly.

739
01:04:34,187 --> 01:04:37,987
You know better the
value of having a son alive!

740
01:04:38,224 --> 01:04:41,250
Don't do something that
will make you lose him! Konda!

741
01:05:04,284 --> 01:05:05,751
What happened, father?
- Come along!

742
01:05:05,885 --> 01:05:07,512
Tell me what the matter is!

743
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,214
Venkatesam!

744
01:05:14,127 --> 01:05:15,389
What happened, sir?

745
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:17,087
Break his bones!

746
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:26,632
Father, stop them!

747
01:05:26,739 --> 01:05:28,536
Father, please stop this!

748
01:05:28,975 --> 01:05:30,306
Finish him!

749
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:33,004
Father, please listen to me!

750
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:39,211
Father..

751
01:06:09,415 --> 01:06:14,182
What a tragic story!

752
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:20,691
No one should fall in
love with a rich girl.

753
01:06:21,194 --> 01:06:25,062
Next time look for a
girl within your reach.

754
01:06:25,498 --> 01:06:27,022
Don't tell her that you
stood first in the exam!

755
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:28,656
Tell her that you
failed and stood last!

756
01:06:29,002 --> 01:06:32,836
l can't bear to hear this tragic
story any more. l take your leave.

757
01:06:32,939 --> 01:06:34,236
Where will you go?

758
01:06:34,707 --> 01:06:37,505
Didn't l tell you there would be a
question at the end? - Shoot it!

759
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:39,475
One day Anjali's
father came to our home..

760
01:06:39,612 --> 01:06:41,773
..and said that his daughter likes me.

761
01:06:41,881 --> 01:06:42,973
He said that he'd
get her married to me.

762
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:47,377
The very next day he came to say
that the marriage is cancelled.

763
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,782
The madcap!
- Surprising!

764
01:06:49,322 --> 01:06:52,883
l went and asked him the
reason for cancelling..

765
01:06:53,393 --> 01:06:55,987
..but he got me bashed up by goons.

766
01:06:57,096 --> 01:07:02,329
What must have happened?
- What a silly question !

767
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:08,699
Bro, you went to a bar and..

768
01:07:08,808 --> 01:07:12,266
..got dead drunk and
danced with a girl.

769
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:16,207
He got enraged on hearing
that and got you bashed up!

770
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:18,442
Why did you beat me?!

771
01:07:18,551 --> 01:07:21,019
Even the day before, l was
drunk when l called their home.

772
01:07:21,187 --> 01:07:22,654
Why didn't he do it at that time?

773
01:07:23,189 --> 01:07:24,918
That is something l too
don't understand, bro.

774
01:07:27,594 --> 01:07:31,121
You said you can count the stars
- My mistake. - What is it?

775
01:07:31,497 --> 01:07:36,434
l was greedy for the free liquor
and promised to listen to the story.

776
01:07:36,569 --> 01:07:39,265
l won't do this again !
- Hey, wait there!

777
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:43,100
Someone tell me what
actually happened!

778
01:07:44,277 --> 01:07:46,302
l will tell you.
- Who is that?

779
01:07:54,253 --> 01:07:55,379
l will tell you.

780
01:07:59,759 --> 01:08:03,251
This man seems to be
dead drunk. Throw him out!

781
01:08:03,396 --> 01:08:04,863
Your name is Venkatesam.

782
01:08:05,264 --> 01:08:07,289
The girl you fell in
love with is Anjali.

783
01:08:07,433 --> 01:08:09,924
You overheard when l
narrated it to the shorty.

784
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:15,804
Your father's name is Krishna Rao.

785
01:08:17,543 --> 01:08:19,909
He is a head clerk in
the lrrigation Department.

786
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:23,908
Anjali's father is Siva Prasad.

787
01:08:25,952 --> 01:08:28,318
The owner of Anjali
group of companies.

788
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:32,082
They have a huge
mansion on road no 12.

789
01:08:34,427 --> 01:08:37,453
All the cars he uses has
the same number - 6666.

790
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:44,728
Who are you?!

791
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:48,567
How do you know all these?

792
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:49,800
Not just this..

793
01:08:49,909 --> 01:08:53,401
l am the only one who knows

794
01:09:24,734 --> 01:09:27,669
My name is Prasad.
l am from Vishakapatnam.

795
01:09:30,373 --> 01:09:33,365
My wife died giving
birth to my daughter.

796
01:09:34,077 --> 01:09:37,945
From then my daughter
was my life and happiness.

797
01:09:45,755 --> 01:09:50,852
''Let the dreams have
wings and fly high''

798
01:09:50,994 --> 01:09:56,022
''Let them cross the
clouds and reach the stars''

799
01:09:56,132 --> 01:10:05,336
''O girl! My little girl!''

800
01:10:05,709 --> 01:10:15,516
''My little girl!
My little girl! You are my angel''

801
01:10:16,152 --> 01:10:27,051
''My child! You are my life.''

802
01:10:27,163 --> 01:10:36,697
''My child! You are my life.''

803
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:17,273
''You are filled my world, dear child.''

804
01:11:17,414 --> 01:11:27,619
''Your smiles makes my world joyful''

805
01:11:27,724 --> 01:11:38,123
''When l hear your sweet voice,
all my pain goes away.''

806
01:11:38,234 --> 01:11:43,228
''lf you get angry, l will be sad.''

807
01:11:43,373 --> 01:11:48,310
''l am living for you, my child''

808
01:11:48,445 --> 01:11:56,944
''O girl! My little girl!''

809
01:11:58,722 --> 01:12:03,887
''Let the dreams have
wings and fly high''

810
01:12:03,994 --> 01:12:09,489
''Let them cross the
clouds and reach the stars''

811
01:12:32,355 --> 01:12:33,720
What do you do?

812
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:36,115
l am working as
guard at an ATM center.

813
01:12:36,259 --> 01:12:37,419
What happened to my daughter?

814
01:12:37,527 --> 01:12:38,858
How much you earn monthly?

815
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:42,892
Five thousand after all cuttings.
What happened to my child?

816
01:12:43,033 --> 01:12:44,557
ls there anyone who
could lend you money?

817
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:46,294
No one is there. What
happened to my child?

818
01:12:47,737 --> 01:12:51,104
Sorry! What happened
to my child, doctor?

819
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:52,902
Acute milot leukemia!

820
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,935
What is that, doctor?
- A type of cancer.

821
01:12:56,379 --> 01:12:57,641
Cancer?!

822
01:12:57,914 --> 01:13:00,712
lt is in primary stages.
So she can be cured.

823
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:03,045
But we have to do
bone marrow transplant.

824
01:13:03,186 --> 01:13:04,483
That too before one year.

825
01:13:05,855 --> 01:13:07,379
There is no proper surgeon here.

826
01:13:07,524 --> 01:13:09,458
We have to call someone from UK.

827
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:12,452
This is very expensive process.

828
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:14,052
How much, doctor?

829
01:13:14,164 --> 01:13:17,497
lncluding post operation expenses,
at least one million rupees.

830
01:13:19,702 --> 01:13:23,194
Since there is time for surgery,
better you arrange for the money.

831
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:29,342
'l was in a state of helplessness.'

832
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:34,473
'l earn five thousand a month.
From where should l bring a million?'

833
01:13:35,752 --> 01:13:38,118
'l was scared even to think about.'

834
01:14:06,015 --> 01:14:10,611
Dad!
- What is it, my child?

835
01:14:10,753 --> 01:14:12,618
What is death, dad?

836
01:14:12,956 --> 01:14:15,754
Death?! What about death?

837
01:14:15,859 --> 01:14:17,588
Who is going to die and why?

838
01:14:17,694 --> 01:14:19,093
Am l not going to die?

839
01:14:19,195 --> 01:14:20,321
Who said that?

840
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:22,489
Nurse aunty said so.

841
01:14:24,067 --> 01:14:28,026
She is talking about another child.
lt is another child.

842
01:14:28,138 --> 01:14:30,197
But Pinky is my name, dad.

843
01:14:32,175 --> 01:14:36,043
l thought of telling
you an important thing.

844
01:14:36,146 --> 01:14:38,273
How could l forget?

845
01:14:38,381 --> 01:14:39,746
What is it, dad?

846
01:14:41,117 --> 01:14:43,711
No. You will say that to
everyone if l tell you.

847
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:47,085
Please, dad! l wouldn't
say it to anyone. Promise!

848
01:14:48,691 --> 01:14:50,386
This is top secret.

849
01:14:51,127 --> 01:14:54,426
When l went to night duty
the day before yesterday..

850
01:14:54,531 --> 01:14:55,828
What happened?

851
01:14:58,835 --> 01:15:03,670
lt was raining heavily.
The wind blew fiercely.

852
01:15:03,806 --> 01:15:08,140
ATM's door opened. A
small kid came inside.

853
01:15:08,244 --> 01:15:09,939
Small child? Was he of my age?

854
01:15:10,046 --> 01:15:11,411
He was smaller than you.

855
01:15:11,514 --> 01:15:17,350
l see! - He was looking at
me and l was looking at him.

856
01:15:17,453 --> 01:15:19,785
Slowly he came inside.

857
01:15:22,225 --> 01:15:25,854
l thought it was raining heavily,
so let him stay for a while.

858
01:15:25,995 --> 01:15:29,863
But from the moment he entered
in he started pressing buttons..

859
01:15:29,999 --> 01:15:34,299
..throwing the files
and messing the place.

860
01:15:34,437 --> 01:15:35,529
Bad boy!

861
01:15:35,672 --> 01:15:39,130
l got very angry. l
thought of slapping him.

862
01:15:39,275 --> 01:15:41,300
But he ran away.

863
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:44,039
How can l keep quiet? l chased him.

864
01:15:44,147 --> 01:15:45,842
He was running and l was chasing.

865
01:15:45,982 --> 01:15:47,540
At last l caught him.

866
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:51,183
When l thought of
hitting him with my handstick..

867
01:15:51,321 --> 01:15:56,884
..he grew up, grew up and became big.

868
01:15:56,993 --> 01:15:58,051
As big as you?!

869
01:15:58,194 --> 01:16:01,129
No, to the size of this hospital.

870
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,531
Do you know who that child was?

871
01:16:05,635 --> 01:16:06,693
Who?

872
01:16:06,836 --> 01:16:07,894
l won't tell you.

873
01:16:08,037 --> 01:16:10,471
Please, dad! Please tell me.

874
01:16:10,974 --> 01:16:12,271
Lord Krishna.

875
01:16:12,775 --> 01:16:14,834
Do you know what did he say?

876
01:16:15,878 --> 01:16:20,838
Prasad! You
worshipped me all these years.

877
01:16:21,284 --> 01:16:24,776
l was pleased with your
devotion and giving you something.

878
01:16:24,887 --> 01:16:26,184
What did he give you?

879
01:16:28,591 --> 01:16:30,320
No one is listening. Tell me.

880
01:16:37,767 --> 01:16:39,394
He gave me this locket.

881
01:16:39,802 --> 01:16:43,260
He said if you wear this,
l will be always with you.

882
01:16:43,373 --> 01:16:46,672
And that l won't have fear or pain.

883
01:16:46,776 --> 01:16:48,073
Do you want this?

884
01:16:48,177 --> 01:16:51,635
Will you give it to me?
- Sure!

885
01:16:57,887 --> 01:16:59,878
Dad! Now nothing will
happen to me. lsn't it?

886
01:16:59,989 --> 01:17:02,981
Yes, my child. Lord
Krishna will protect you.

887
01:17:03,092 --> 01:17:06,061
Sir! l must give injection to her.

888
01:17:17,473 --> 01:17:20,533
l didn't feel pain when
she gave the injection, dad.

889
01:17:20,643 --> 01:17:23,077
'l wanted to save my
daughter at any cost.'

890
01:17:23,379 --> 01:17:25,574
'l wanted to earn money at any cost.'

891
01:17:26,249 --> 01:17:29,844
'At that moment l have
decided to go to Muscat'

892
01:17:30,386 --> 01:17:32,183
How would you get money to go there?

893
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:37,155
l have saved seventy
thousand on my child's name.

894
01:17:37,727 --> 01:17:39,319
They will be enough
for me to go there.

895
01:17:39,429 --> 01:17:41,397
But where will you
keep her till you return?

896
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,432
l will be back as soon as possible.

897
01:17:46,703 --> 01:17:48,398
Please take care of my child.
Go, my child.

898
01:17:48,504 --> 01:17:49,869
Please come, dear.

899
01:17:58,915 --> 01:18:03,443
Dad!
- My child!

900
01:18:08,024 --> 01:18:11,619
You don't worry,
dad. l will be alright.

901
01:18:13,429 --> 01:18:19,857
You are going out of state.
Keep Krishna with you.

902
01:18:22,138 --> 01:18:24,163
My child! My angel!

903
01:18:30,313 --> 01:18:33,805
l wanted to go to
Muscat without any delay.

904
01:18:40,523 --> 01:18:42,081
Are you the guard from Vizag?

905
01:18:42,191 --> 01:18:43,488
Yes, sir.

906
01:18:50,166 --> 01:18:53,932
'When l thought that
everything is going to be fine..''

907
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,838
We have been cheated, sir.

908
01:19:01,577 --> 01:19:04,375
l thought l was
going a step ahead but..

909
01:19:04,514 --> 01:19:06,846
..my misfortune
pushed me two steps back.

910
01:19:07,383 --> 01:19:10,841
l didn't have any
other way but to go back.

911
01:19:10,987 --> 01:19:12,921
l didn't have any money with me.

912
01:19:13,055 --> 01:19:17,583
l couldn't do anything. That
is why l reached the station.

913
01:19:19,061 --> 01:19:20,756
Hey, Mallesh ! Lock the room.

914
01:19:20,897 --> 01:19:21,989
l already did it.

915
01:19:49,292 --> 01:19:51,817
See how you are coughing, swami?

916
01:19:51,961 --> 01:19:56,694
Look at yourself. Why
don't you stop smoking ganja?

917
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,928
My husband died because of that habit.

918
01:20:02,738 --> 01:20:08,005
Poor Rattalu ! You humans
are bound to life and death.

919
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:11,602
You take birth once and die once.

920
01:20:12,148 --> 01:20:16,346
But l am not like that. l know
how to enter into another's body.

921
01:20:16,486 --> 01:20:18,920
The moment my body gets weekened..

922
01:20:19,055 --> 01:20:22,218
..my soul will enter another body.

923
01:20:22,358 --> 01:20:23,552
ls that true, swami?

924
01:20:23,693 --> 01:20:26,753
Yes, Rattalu ! l am not from this era.

925
01:20:26,896 --> 01:20:29,660
l am alive since Dwaparayuga.
- l see.

926
01:20:29,765 --> 01:20:36,170
Sri Krishna, Balarama,
Vasanta, Kuchela and l..

927
01:20:36,272 --> 01:20:39,264
..used to look after
the cattle at Dwaraka.

928
01:20:39,408 --> 01:20:43,469
l have changed a thousand
bodies before this body.

929
01:20:43,579 --> 01:20:47,606
Rattalu ! You don't
worry about my health.

930
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:49,149
You can go now.

931
01:20:49,285 --> 01:20:53,585
l told you to stop smoking ganja
and you are speaking something.

932
01:20:53,689 --> 01:20:56,681
At least have this idly.
l have to go now.

933
01:20:57,093 --> 01:20:59,653
Don't know what he is saying.

934
01:21:09,572 --> 01:21:12,132
'When l heard the
strange story that sage said..'

935
01:21:12,475 --> 01:21:14,500
'..l laughed even in
this painful situation.'

936
01:21:40,503 --> 01:21:42,903
lt is definitely him, sir.

937
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:05,654
Who are you?

938
01:22:19,475 --> 01:22:22,308
Oh, no! Alas!

939
01:22:26,282 --> 01:22:29,115
He is famous criminal, sir.
We caught him after ten years.

940
01:22:29,218 --> 01:22:30,276
l am innocent.

941
01:22:30,419 --> 01:22:32,114
How dare you blow our
steamers with rocket launchers?

942
01:22:32,221 --> 01:22:33,688
l am from Vizag, sir.

943
01:22:33,789 --> 01:22:35,256
l am working as
guard at an ATM center.

944
01:22:35,391 --> 01:22:37,723
He killed ten of our men, sir.
Let us kill him here itself.

945
01:22:55,444 --> 01:22:59,278
Hello! Okay! Over!

946
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:03,077
Sir! Wrong identity, sir.

947
01:23:03,185 --> 01:23:04,675
The original person
was arrested by our men..

948
01:23:04,787 --> 01:23:06,277
..at Shankarpalli railway station.

949
01:23:06,789 --> 01:23:08,086
He has been taken to our headquarters.

950
01:23:08,224 --> 01:23:09,248
What about him?

951
01:23:09,992 --> 01:23:11,152
Release him.

952
01:23:11,293 --> 01:23:12,487
Come on ! Let us go.

953
01:23:44,293 --> 01:23:45,726
Hey, wait!

954
01:23:54,637 --> 01:23:57,162
'l didn't understand
what was happening.'

955
01:23:57,673 --> 01:24:01,200
'They bashed me up even
though l was innocent.'

956
01:24:01,544 --> 01:24:04,843
'But even though that sage was
smoking ganja in front of the police..'

957
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,710
'..they saluted him
and gave him money too.'

958
01:24:34,443 --> 01:24:35,808
What happened?

959
01:24:36,712 --> 01:24:38,179
Water?

960
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:50,181
Get up! Have some water.

961
01:25:53,088 --> 01:25:56,546
'lf your daughter has to live,
she need bone marrow transplant.'

962
01:25:57,426 --> 01:25:59,155
'Will l die, dad?'

963
01:26:24,053 --> 01:26:27,887
This sage doesn't listen
to anything l tell him.

964
01:26:28,023 --> 01:26:29,854
Did you take ganja
overdose and fell asleep?

965
01:26:29,959 --> 01:26:34,157
Hey sage! Wake up! Wake up!

966
01:26:36,031 --> 01:26:38,829
Oh, no! How does this happen?

967
01:26:38,934 --> 01:26:40,401
The sage has died. He is dead.

968
01:26:40,502 --> 01:26:47,066
Rattalu ! Rattalu !

969
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:54,014
Poor Rattalu !

970
01:26:56,018 --> 01:27:02,719
l didn't die, Rattalu !
l told you last night.

971
01:27:03,158 --> 01:27:06,150
l know how to enter into another body.

972
01:27:06,662 --> 01:27:13,033
That body became useless. That
is why l entered into this body.

973
01:27:30,486 --> 01:27:34,820
He told me yesterday that he is
going to enter into another body.

974
01:27:34,924 --> 01:27:36,084
l was a fool not to believe him.

975
01:27:36,225 --> 01:27:39,592
l thought he was bluffing.
But he is really God.

976
01:27:39,695 --> 01:27:41,925
Hey, that sage is a
friend of Lord Rama.

977
01:27:42,031 --> 01:27:44,124
Not Lord Rama. lt is Lord Krishna.

978
01:27:44,233 --> 01:27:47,225
He told me too that he
would change his body.

979
01:27:50,506 --> 01:27:54,272
''Krishna! Krishna! Krishna! Krishna!''

980
01:27:54,376 --> 01:27:59,814
''O sage! O sage! You are great!''

981
01:27:59,949 --> 01:28:07,583
''When you became sage,
Mother Earth felt very happy.''

982
01:28:07,690 --> 01:28:12,650
''You became the God in this world''

983
01:28:12,795 --> 01:28:20,065
''We pray to you ! Please
give us your divine blessing!''

984
01:28:20,202 --> 01:28:26,573
''O sage! O sage! You are great!''

985
01:28:26,675 --> 01:28:33,945
''When you became sage,
Mother Earth felt very happy.''

986
01:28:39,755 --> 01:28:46,251
''We cannot go to Kashi, that
is why we came to you, O sage''

987
01:28:46,395 --> 01:28:52,891
''Without going anywhere we
saw the divine magic of Vishnu''

988
01:29:09,485 --> 01:29:14,149
''Hail, Lord Krishna! Hail,
Lord Srirama!''

989
01:29:14,256 --> 01:29:22,425
''Hail, Lord Krishna! Hail,
Lord Srirama!''

990
01:29:22,564 --> 01:29:25,761
''We want to hear
your divine preaching''

991
01:29:25,901 --> 01:29:31,305
''We want to win your divine grace''

992
01:29:32,274 --> 01:29:40,704
''No matter whatever l do,
l want to earn profits.''

993
01:29:42,317 --> 01:29:49,587
''l want to become as smart as
Prabhas and as rich as Vijay Malya''

994
01:29:51,326 --> 01:29:57,424
''Please change our
fortunes with your divine grace''

995
01:29:57,566 --> 01:30:01,002
''We don't ask for anything else.''

996
01:30:01,136 --> 01:30:06,972
''O sage! O sage! You are great!''

997
01:30:07,109 --> 01:30:13,673
''When you became sage,
Mother Earth felt very happy.''

998
01:30:13,816 --> 01:30:15,443
''Krishna! Krishna! Krishna! Krishna!''

999
01:30:15,551 --> 01:30:16,882
''Hey, Krishna!
Krishna! Hare! Hare Krishna!''

1000
01:30:16,985 --> 01:30:20,887
''Krishna! Krishna! Krishna! Krishna!''

1001
01:30:21,256 --> 01:30:27,889
''O sage! O sage! You are great!''

1002
01:30:27,996 --> 01:30:31,898
'People turn into demons
due to circumstances.'

1003
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,561
'But in my case
strangely l turned into a God.'

1004
01:30:35,704 --> 01:30:38,332
'Not to one or two but
to thousands of people.'

1005
01:30:40,609 --> 01:30:43,772
'They gave me eight and
half lakhs in return.'

1006
01:30:43,879 --> 01:30:45,642
'One and half lakh more.
After l earn one million..'

1007
01:30:45,747 --> 01:30:47,806
'..l shall leave this place.'

1008
01:30:47,916 --> 01:30:49,645
What is the collection?

1009
01:31:04,566 --> 01:31:07,729
Your collection can compete with
Lord Venkateswara of Tirupati.

1010
01:31:07,870 --> 01:31:11,829
lf you continue this for five years,
you can become Ambani.

1011
01:31:12,307 --> 01:31:15,174
Sir, what are you saying?
This money belongs to people.

1012
01:31:15,277 --> 01:31:17,438
You are telling people
that money is the reason..

1013
01:31:17,546 --> 01:31:20,037
..behind all their troubles and pains.

1014
01:31:20,182 --> 01:31:23,310
Poor fellows! They trusted
you and giving you money.

1015
01:31:24,052 --> 01:31:27,988
And you are counting all the
stolen money and saving it.

1016
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:31,787
l didn't steal or
saving it. lt is not for me.

1017
01:31:31,894 --> 01:31:32,986
For the welfare of this world..

1018
01:31:33,095 --> 01:31:34,289
Stop it now.

1019
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:39,733
Tell this nonsense to the
foolish devotees who come to you.

1020
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:49,873
l know who you are and what you did.

1021
01:31:50,712 --> 01:31:52,441
This is bulletproof jacket, sir.

1022
01:31:52,581 --> 01:31:54,048
Okay, you can go.

1023
01:31:56,552 --> 01:31:57,951
You were there at the right time.

1024
01:31:58,086 --> 01:31:59,553
Otherwise that innocent fellow
would have died unnecessarily.

1025
01:31:59,655 --> 01:32:00,952
Who cares even if he dies?

1026
01:32:01,056 --> 01:32:02,489
Where is your another magazine?

1027
01:32:10,132 --> 01:32:11,690
lt fell down in the
fight near railway station.

1028
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,290
Hey, someone go and bring it here.

1029
01:32:13,402 --> 01:32:15,700
Don't worry. l am going
that way. l will bring it.

1030
01:33:06,188 --> 01:33:08,418
l thought of killing
you that same day.

1031
01:33:09,324 --> 01:33:12,157
But my sixth sense stopped me.

1032
01:33:12,494 --> 01:33:16,021
l realized that you'll be very
useful to me if l use you correctly.

1033
01:33:16,431 --> 01:33:17,955
lt turned out just
as l thought it would.

1034
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:24,029
Capital, license, rules, tax,
permits, nothing, nothing is required.

1035
01:33:24,172 --> 01:33:28,131
You became a business that
brings wonderful profits.

1036
01:33:28,277 --> 01:33:31,440
l didn't do this purposely.
Circumstances forced me to..

1037
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:32,672
Stop it!

1038
01:33:33,382 --> 01:33:36,681
Every fool that does a crime
has some or the other reason.

1039
01:33:36,818 --> 01:33:38,843
My daughter needs to be operated.

1040
01:33:38,954 --> 01:33:42,253
l need 1 million rupees, and
that too in just one year.

1041
01:33:42,357 --> 01:33:47,226
That's why.. l had no other choice.
Please sir, have mercy on me.

1042
01:33:48,563 --> 01:33:52,556
A politician has no justice
and a policeman has no mercy.

1043
01:33:53,035 --> 01:33:58,803
l don't feel anything when a man
writhes in pain in third degree.

1044
01:33:58,907 --> 01:34:01,102
ln that case, why will l
have any mercy on you?

1045
01:34:01,176 --> 01:34:04,942
lf these photos are leaked,
people will beat you as a mad dog.

1046
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,548
Even in that beating,
there is a comedy.

1047
01:34:07,649 --> 01:34:09,514
Whoever bowed down to you many times..

1048
01:34:09,618 --> 01:34:12,553
..whoever paid you more money,
they will beat you more times.

1049
01:34:13,021 --> 01:34:16,354
lf they are really angry,
they will even kill you.

1050
01:34:16,458 --> 01:34:20,588
Even if you escape from them,
the police will file a case..

1051
01:34:20,729 --> 01:34:23,721
..against you saying that
you killed that old sage.

1052
01:34:23,832 --> 01:34:28,132
After that your whole life will be..
in your friend's birthplace.

1053
01:34:28,704 --> 01:34:33,004
l mean.. the
birthplace of Sage Sri Krishna.

1054
01:34:33,108 --> 01:34:35,406
Please sir, please don't do that.

1055
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:42,006
lf you don't want me to do that,
you have to do as l say.

1056
01:34:44,019 --> 01:34:45,509
What do you say?

1057
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:54,418
What will you do now?

1058
01:34:54,563 --> 01:34:57,430
Hey! You don't even know that
we can take as many prints..

1059
01:34:57,532 --> 01:35:00,524
..as we want with one negative.
How did you become a God?

1060
01:35:00,669 --> 01:35:05,038
Be careful! Don't try
your tricks with me!

1061
01:35:05,807 --> 01:35:07,604
Shall l tell you one more thing?

1062
01:35:07,709 --> 01:35:11,406
You will not get those negatives,
no matter what you do.

1063
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:14,374
l kept them in the evidence
room of Task Force office.

1064
01:35:14,816 --> 01:35:16,716
High security place!

1065
01:35:16,852 --> 01:35:20,185
Even if you are reborn ten times,
you can't go anywhere near it.

1066
01:35:20,322 --> 01:35:24,156
Sir, l can't save my
daughter without this money.

1067
01:35:24,726 --> 01:35:27,490
lf she is not there, my
whole life is just waste.

1068
01:35:28,363 --> 01:35:31,355
That's why.. you kill me!
Kill me right here!

1069
01:35:31,466 --> 01:35:34,924
Everyone holds your hands.
And you are holding my hands.

1070
01:35:35,337 --> 01:35:37,464
Alright, we'll make a deal.

1071
01:35:37,572 --> 01:35:40,132
l'll leave you at the time
of your daughter's operation.

1072
01:35:40,909 --> 01:35:44,606
And then, l'll give you a
million rupees in whatever you earn.

1073
01:35:44,713 --> 01:35:48,308
Everything that is left is for me.

1074
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:57,184
From that day, my life
went into Gajapathi's hands.

1075
01:35:57,926 --> 01:36:02,386
l'm just a puppet. He is
the one that moves me.

1076
01:36:02,531 --> 01:36:05,091
What is this? Why are
collections becoming less?

1077
01:36:05,233 --> 01:36:06,530
Actually..

1078
01:36:06,668 --> 01:36:09,603
ln our business, fear and
faith both are like capital.

1079
01:36:09,938 --> 01:36:12,463
Position of planets,
destiny, heaven, hell..

1080
01:36:12,574 --> 01:36:14,303
..tell them something and scare them.

1081
01:36:14,643 --> 01:36:17,635
The more people are scared,
the more money we'll get.

1082
01:36:18,246 --> 01:36:20,646
Money out of fear!

1083
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:25,108
Days are turning into weeks,
weeks are turning into months.

1084
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:27,814
Devotees increased, money increased.

1085
01:36:29,157 --> 01:36:32,126
Along with that,
Gajapathi's greed increased.

1086
01:36:39,701 --> 01:36:41,566
Tomorrow he'll come to meet you.

1087
01:36:41,703 --> 01:36:43,432
Who is he?
- His name is Shiva Prasad.

1088
01:36:43,572 --> 01:36:46,769
From the stage of taking
Municipality, BT roads contracts..

1089
01:36:46,875 --> 01:36:49,400
..he progressed to the stage
of buying a cricket team in lPL.

1090
01:36:49,511 --> 01:36:52,275
The only weakness he has is devotion.

1091
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:56,578
lf he comes to have faith
in you, we'll hit a jackpot.

1092
01:36:56,718 --> 01:36:58,083
Do you think he will put faith in me?

1093
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:02,884
The one who has confidence in
himself, trusts in his hard work.

1094
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:08,362
The one who comes up in life with
just luck, trusts in God excessively.

1095
01:37:08,463 --> 01:37:10,988
For example, there is a man.

1096
01:37:11,733 --> 01:37:14,258
He didn't even win as a
ward member in the streets.

1097
01:37:14,369 --> 01:37:17,361
But unexpectedly he became
an MP and went up to Delhi.

1098
01:37:17,472 --> 01:37:20,373
He thinks, l don't
have anything in me.

1099
01:37:20,475 --> 01:37:23,535
Even if l fall or rise up, it
is all because of God's mercy.

1100
01:37:23,678 --> 01:37:26,408
The one who doesn't feed his
neighbor that's dying of hunger..

1101
01:37:26,815 --> 01:37:30,581
..comes to men like you, bows
down and showers his wealth.

1102
01:37:30,685 --> 01:37:33,779
Because, in his view..

1103
01:37:34,422 --> 01:37:37,482
That is an insurance policy with God.

1104
01:37:39,127 --> 01:37:43,257
He is of that type. See the
rings and amulets on his hand.

1105
01:37:43,398 --> 01:37:46,595
Whenever a sage enters the city,
he is the first one to go to him.

1106
01:37:46,701 --> 01:37:48,259
When he went around so many people..

1107
01:37:48,370 --> 01:37:50,099
..what's the guarantee
that he will stay with us?

1108
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:53,071
lf he doesn't stay,
we'll make him stay.

1109
01:37:56,678 --> 01:38:00,580
And for that to happen,
there should be a miracle.

1110
01:38:06,855 --> 01:38:08,322
Sage!

1111
01:38:09,691 --> 01:38:10,953
Sage!

1112
01:38:12,093 --> 01:38:13,185
Sage!

1113
01:38:13,962 --> 01:38:17,090
Sage is meditating on the
Bhagawad Geetha. Please go!

1114
01:38:21,269 --> 01:38:22,634
Devotee!

1115
01:38:23,572 --> 01:38:25,164
Be careful!

1116
01:38:25,273 --> 01:38:27,673
There is a chance
that you'll die today.

1117
01:38:29,044 --> 01:38:31,945
You stay away from your shadow too.

1118
01:38:32,047 --> 01:38:33,207
Sage!

1119
01:38:33,315 --> 01:38:37,376
Death bird is crying! l can hear it!

1120
01:38:38,219 --> 01:38:43,213
Death messengers are waiting.
You shouldn't relax for a moment.

1121
01:38:43,725 --> 01:38:45,693
Be on the alert!

1122
01:38:45,794 --> 01:38:47,421
Sage!

1123
01:38:47,529 --> 01:38:50,020
l'll do what l can.

1124
01:38:50,131 --> 01:38:52,326
You take your precautions.

1125
01:38:52,634 --> 01:38:55,432
And then, Krishna will
take care of the rest.

1126
01:38:55,537 --> 01:38:57,732
Hail Krishna!

1127
01:39:02,210 --> 01:39:04,178
Why did the sage say like that?

1128
01:39:04,279 --> 01:39:07,043
Sages say many things. All
of them don't come true.

1129
01:39:07,215 --> 01:39:09,945
You don't worry, brother. Nothing
will happen to you when l'm here.

1130
01:39:15,624 --> 01:39:16,955
Hey!

1131
01:39:17,058 --> 01:39:19,026
Hey!

1132
01:39:20,462 --> 01:39:21,690
Brother, sit down !

1133
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:23,297
Lie down ! Sit down !

1134
01:39:27,836 --> 01:39:30,430
Hey, stop! Stop!

1135
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:33,402
Stop!

1136
01:39:41,116 --> 01:39:42,913
lt happened just as the sage said.

1137
01:39:43,018 --> 01:39:45,316
Yes, that true!

1138
01:39:47,722 --> 01:39:50,384
Sage, everything
happened just as you said.

1139
01:39:50,492 --> 01:39:54,223
Someone came, they removed
their guns, they shot at me.

1140
01:39:54,362 --> 01:39:57,263
The bullets hit the wall, l was in
the middle, nothing happened to me.

1141
01:39:57,365 --> 01:39:58,889
Everything is so strange, sage.

1142
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,524
Everything is the doing of Krishna!

1143
01:40:00,635 --> 01:40:02,398
You are a God, sage! You are a God!

1144
01:40:02,504 --> 01:40:04,165
Whatever you say happens, sage!

1145
01:40:05,206 --> 01:40:07,970
Shiva Prasad started
to have faith in me.

1146
01:40:08,076 --> 01:40:11,477
He fully trusted
that l saved his life.

1147
01:40:17,152 --> 01:40:21,020
From that day onwards,
whenever he wanted to do something..

1148
01:40:21,322 --> 01:40:22,721
..he told that to me and
asked me to bless him.

1149
01:40:22,857 --> 01:40:29,353
Sage, l'm putting a
tender for a railway contract.

1150
01:40:30,031 --> 01:40:32,158
Hail Sri Krishna!

1151
01:40:34,669 --> 01:40:39,003
Hello! Okay! Okay!

1152
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:40,903
Hey Konda!
- Yes, brother!

1153
01:40:41,009 --> 01:40:43,034
We got the contract of Metro Rail.

1154
01:40:43,178 --> 01:40:44,668
ls that true, brother?

1155
01:40:44,779 --> 01:40:46,872
All this is sage's mercy.

1156
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:49,508
And if something bad happened..

1157
01:40:49,617 --> 01:40:52,848
Brother, there was a fire
accident in our Cotton Garden.

1158
01:40:52,987 --> 01:40:54,818
9 people are seriously injured.

1159
01:40:55,423 --> 01:40:58,950
He remembered his sins
and blamed them for it.

1160
01:40:59,094 --> 01:41:00,959
l ate chicken of the
day of Krishna Ashtami.

1161
01:41:01,096 --> 01:41:03,792
l think this happened because
of it. Please forgive me, sage.

1162
01:41:03,898 --> 01:41:05,456
l will never be greedy like this.

1163
01:41:05,567 --> 01:41:08,092
But he never doubted me.

1164
01:41:08,203 --> 01:41:11,604
We tackled some people like
this and got them to our track.

1165
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:14,641
But some people came
to me on their own.

1166
01:41:14,743 --> 01:41:18,509
Chandra Kiran lPS! A
very strict officer!

1167
01:41:18,646 --> 01:41:21,945
Very intelligent! But..
he acts crazy sometimes.

1168
01:41:27,188 --> 01:41:30,021
Sage, what is the secret of creation?

1169
01:41:30,325 --> 01:41:32,259
What do l know?

1170
01:41:33,561 --> 01:41:38,328
Secret of creation is a secret.

1171
01:41:50,812 --> 01:41:53,804
Secret of creation is
not something one can say.

1172
01:41:54,082 --> 01:41:56,880
You should search for it
and attain it yourself.

1173
01:41:57,018 --> 01:42:01,079
Lord Sri Krishna said this in Geeta.

1174
01:42:01,189 --> 01:42:04,818
You said that wonderfully in
one word, in simple terms, sage.

1175
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:07,088
l can tell you without any doubt..

1176
01:42:07,195 --> 01:42:08,787
Dr. Shankar Melkoti!

1177
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:10,830
Ph D in Quantum Physics.

1178
01:42:10,932 --> 01:42:12,229
That everything that
happens in this universe..

1179
01:42:12,333 --> 01:42:14,130
Even he is my devotee.
- ls pure physics.

1180
01:42:14,269 --> 01:42:17,102
Sage, what happens to us when we die?

1181
01:42:17,205 --> 01:42:18,433
What happens to us when we die?

1182
01:42:19,507 --> 01:42:23,773
We will know that only when we die.

1183
01:42:23,912 --> 01:42:27,814
Wow! All souls are
the same till death.

1184
01:42:27,916 --> 01:42:31,750
After that, their deeds
will decide their fate.

1185
01:42:31,853 --> 01:42:35,118
Lord Vishnu said that in
detail in Garuda Puranam.

1186
01:42:35,256 --> 01:42:37,850
You said that so lightly, sage.

1187
01:42:38,393 --> 01:42:40,452
Hail Sri Krishna!

1188
01:42:40,562 --> 01:42:46,501
''O sage! O sage! You are great!''

1189
01:42:46,601 --> 01:42:53,268
''When you became sage,
Mother Earth felt very happy.''

1190
01:42:53,374 --> 01:42:55,774
''Krishana! Krishna!
Krishna! Krishna! Krishna!''

1191
01:42:55,877 --> 01:42:59,540
''Krishna! Krishna!
Hare! Hare! Hare Krishna!''

1192
01:42:59,647 --> 01:43:02,946
''We need money for our business,
please give it.''

1193
01:43:03,051 --> 01:43:08,284
''But without any investment
get us magical reputation''

1194
01:43:09,424 --> 01:43:12,825
''One always thinks
of earning easy money''

1195
01:43:12,927 --> 01:43:18,229
''For that he prays to anyone visible.''

1196
01:43:18,466 --> 01:43:23,267
''Everyone wants to have riches.''

1197
01:43:23,371 --> 01:43:28,274
''Swami! We need a box that
fulfills all our demands.''

1198
01:43:28,343 --> 01:43:33,474
''We want to have your magical powers.''

1199
01:43:33,581 --> 01:43:36,641
''What else is needed?''

1200
01:43:36,751 --> 01:43:42,712
''O sage! O sage! You are great!''

1201
01:43:42,824 --> 01:43:50,128
''When you became sage,
Mother Earth felt very happy.''

1202
01:43:50,265 --> 01:43:53,132
And like that before my eyes,
one year was completed.

1203
01:43:54,702 --> 01:43:57,967
Gajapathi! l have to get my
daughter operated in a week.

1204
01:43:58,106 --> 01:43:59,334
l have to go!

1205
01:43:59,741 --> 01:44:01,436
How can you go off suddenly?

1206
01:44:01,743 --> 01:44:03,677
What will happen here? You can't go!

1207
01:44:03,811 --> 01:44:06,211
l told you before that
l will go after a year.

1208
01:44:06,314 --> 01:44:08,339
And you agreed to it.
- Hey!

1209
01:44:09,150 --> 01:44:11,618
lt's the matter of my
daughter's life and death.

1210
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,320
Okay! Okay! l have an
hour's work in the station.

1211
01:44:14,455 --> 01:44:16,013
We'll talk after l come back.
- That means..

1212
01:44:16,157 --> 01:44:18,921
Don't talk too much. l said
we'll talk after l come back.

1213
01:44:29,637 --> 01:44:30,763
Hello!

1214
01:44:30,872 --> 01:44:32,601
l have to talk to you.

1215
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:33,798
At this hour?

1216
01:44:33,908 --> 01:44:36,809
lt's an important matter,
sage. Please, sage.

1217
01:44:36,911 --> 01:44:38,674
Alright, come!

1218
01:44:41,416 --> 01:44:43,316
l'm in a big problem, sage.

1219
01:44:43,418 --> 01:44:44,476
What is it?

1220
01:44:44,619 --> 01:44:46,746
My daughter is in love with someone.

1221
01:44:46,854 --> 01:44:51,917
She says she wants him. l don't
know what to do. Tell me, sage.

1222
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:54,927
What can we do after
they've liked each other?

1223
01:44:55,596 --> 01:44:59,123
That's correct, sage.
But he is a mechanic.

1224
01:44:59,567 --> 01:45:04,231
l raised up my daughter like a
princess, how can l give her to him?

1225
01:45:04,939 --> 01:45:09,308
But from childhood, l never
said no to her for anything.

1226
01:45:10,078 --> 01:45:13,013
l will do anything for
my daughter's happiness.

1227
01:45:13,881 --> 01:45:19,012
But sage, if there are tears in
her eyes, my heart stops beating.

1228
01:45:19,654 --> 01:45:21,417
Tell me, sage! What should l do now?

1229
01:45:21,556 --> 01:45:23,421
Do one thing. Get her married to him.

1230
01:45:23,524 --> 01:45:27,392
But he has no money,
education or status. How can l..

1231
01:45:30,932 --> 01:45:32,797
What did we bring when we were born?

1232
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:34,834
What will we take when we die?

1233
01:45:34,936 --> 01:45:37,461
Everything that happens
between birth and death is a mystery.

1234
01:45:37,605 --> 01:45:40,073
To know that is the real education.

1235
01:45:40,208 --> 01:45:43,109
Look, Shiva Prasad! You can
give a billion rupees as dowry..

1236
01:45:43,211 --> 01:45:45,111
..and get a son-in-law
that has a trillion rupees.

1237
01:45:45,213 --> 01:45:47,647
But, can you give
happiness to your daughter?

1238
01:45:47,749 --> 01:45:50,081
And who are we to
say no to their love?

1239
01:45:50,351 --> 01:45:52,717
We don't have that right.
Get them married.

1240
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:56,620
Sage! lf you've said it,
it's correct, sage.

1241
01:45:57,025 --> 01:45:59,425
What else do l need apart
from my daughter's happiness?

1242
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:02,961
l will do that, sage. l
will get them married.

1243
01:46:14,108 --> 01:46:17,134
What's the matter? Why did
Shiva Prasad come at this hour?

1244
01:46:17,245 --> 01:46:18,439
l have to go.

1245
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:21,775
Why did Shiva Prasad come here?

1246
01:46:21,916 --> 01:46:23,474
He always has some stupid problem.

1247
01:46:23,651 --> 01:46:25,175
lt seems his daughter
fell in love with someone.

1248
01:46:25,319 --> 01:46:27,184
So he came to ask if he
should get them married or not.

1249
01:46:27,655 --> 01:46:28,815
What did you say?

1250
01:46:28,956 --> 01:46:30,821
What can l say? His
daughter fell in love.

1251
01:46:30,925 --> 01:46:31,983
And he is the one that
should get her married.

1252
01:46:32,126 --> 01:46:33,718
What can we do in between? l
told him to get her married.

1253
01:46:34,929 --> 01:46:37,397
We are carefully building
a house from six months..

1254
01:46:37,498 --> 01:46:39,489
..by arranging one
brick after the other.

1255
01:46:40,635 --> 01:46:45,038
You ruined the whole plan like
a house of cards with one word.

1256
01:46:46,007 --> 01:46:47,599
Hey!

1257
01:46:49,010 --> 01:46:53,174
Do you know why l took so much
effort to trap Shiva Prasad?

1258
01:46:53,614 --> 01:46:54,911
Even l have a son.

1259
01:46:55,016 --> 01:46:56,506
What's the connection
between your son and this?

1260
01:46:56,651 --> 01:46:59,677
Hey! lf my son becomes
Shiva Prasad's son-in-law..

1261
01:46:59,787 --> 01:47:01,448
..l will be the
owner of all his wealth.

1262
01:47:01,556 --> 01:47:03,285
l thought that my whole
life will be well settled.

1263
01:47:03,624 --> 01:47:05,353
But you ruined everything!

1264
01:47:07,428 --> 01:47:10,226
Okay! Okay! Nothing is
out of our hands even now.

1265
01:47:10,331 --> 01:47:12,060
Tell him something and
cancel this wedding.

1266
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:14,532
l can't play these games anymore.

1267
01:47:14,635 --> 01:47:17,001
lf you give me my million,
l will go from here.

1268
01:47:17,105 --> 01:47:18,197
Please let me go.

1269
01:47:18,306 --> 01:47:20,103
Please, do this one thing for me.

1270
01:47:20,208 --> 01:47:21,266
Somehow cancel this wedding.

1271
01:47:21,375 --> 01:47:22,535
l can't do that.

1272
01:47:22,677 --> 01:47:24,611
Please cancel this wedding.
- l can't do that.

1273
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:30,116
Do you think it's a joke
because l'm begging you?

1274
01:47:30,218 --> 01:47:34,746
Where will you go? No one will ask
even if l kill and bury you here.

1275
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:39,291
l'll show your photos to people
and prove that you are a fraud.

1276
01:47:39,727 --> 01:47:41,490
l'll make them believe
that you cheated everyone..

1277
01:47:41,596 --> 01:47:43,928
..all these days and ran
away with all their money.

1278
01:47:45,032 --> 01:47:48,524
You will die here! And
your daughter will die there!

1279
01:47:49,604 --> 01:47:53,802
l don't care if you move
the planets or use the stars.

1280
01:47:53,941 --> 01:47:56,501
His daughter should
become my daughter-in-law.

1281
01:47:56,944 --> 01:47:58,673
lf that happens, l'll give you

1282
01:48:01,916 --> 01:48:07,445
You don't have another choice.
Think carefully about it.

1283
01:48:14,095 --> 01:48:16,529
l don't know what to do.

1284
01:48:16,631 --> 01:48:20,431
l don't feel like
separating two lovers unjustly.

1285
01:48:21,235 --> 01:48:23,430
Hello, sage!
- Hello, sage!

1286
01:48:25,773 --> 01:48:27,968
Come with me!
- What is it, sage? What happened?

1287
01:48:28,075 --> 01:48:29,235
What's the matter,
sage? What happened?

1288
01:48:29,343 --> 01:48:31,834
What happened, sage? Please tell me!
- Sage, tell us.

1289
01:48:33,447 --> 01:48:35,745
Mr. Chandra Kiran ! Mr. Melkote!

1290
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:37,044
Why are you addressing us like that?

1291
01:48:37,151 --> 01:48:38,311
We are your devotees.

1292
01:48:38,419 --> 01:48:39,681
Please listen to me.

1293
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:42,550
l'm not a sage. l'm not a God.

1294
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:44,414
l don't know how to
enter another body.

1295
01:48:44,559 --> 01:48:47,187
l don't have miraculous
powers or super powers.

1296
01:48:47,328 --> 01:48:49,193
l lied when l said that
l came from Dwapara era..

1297
01:48:49,297 --> 01:48:52,289
..and that l am Sri
Krishna's friend. They are lies!

1298
01:48:52,433 --> 01:48:54,594
l'm a normal man like you all.

1299
01:48:54,735 --> 01:48:58,000
Like everyone else, l too
have desires and weaknesses.

1300
01:49:00,007 --> 01:49:02,100
But l didn't do all of this purposely.

1301
01:49:02,210 --> 01:49:04,337
Everything happened
unexpectedly on its own.

1302
01:49:04,679 --> 01:49:07,648
Please! You both have to save me.

1303
01:49:13,487 --> 01:49:17,321
l won, sage. You are testing
us and l passed in the test.

1304
01:49:17,425 --> 01:49:22,158
l passed the test, sage. You said
all that to test our faith, right?

1305
01:49:22,263 --> 01:49:26,529
We understood your purpose.
This is enough for this life.

1306
01:49:26,634 --> 01:49:28,864
This satisfaction is
enough for me, sage.

1307
01:49:31,038 --> 01:49:32,835
Sir, at least you
try to understand me.

1308
01:49:32,974 --> 01:49:35,374
l don't have any powers.
l'm a normal man.

1309
01:49:38,546 --> 01:49:41,947
Even l passed in your test, sage.

1310
01:49:42,083 --> 01:49:44,813
Even for me, this
satisfaction is enough.

1311
01:49:52,793 --> 01:49:53,885
Oh, no!

1312
01:49:54,729 --> 01:49:58,495
l had no other choice
that to listen to Gajapathi.

1313
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,992
He made that plan
with his criminal brain.

1314
01:50:02,670 --> 01:50:04,695
Two birds in one shot.

1315
01:50:04,805 --> 01:50:06,602
He should make Shiva
Prasad's daughter..

1316
01:50:06,707 --> 01:50:08,436
..his daughter-in-law and
take away all his wealth.

1317
01:50:08,843 --> 01:50:14,145
And since l'm in his way, he
should get rid of me permanently.

1318
01:50:14,448 --> 01:50:16,473
And he named it Operation Anthardanam.

1319
01:50:16,584 --> 01:50:19,018
Sage will favor you
with his presence shortly.

1320
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:21,554
We request all the
devotees to show patience.

1321
01:50:22,657 --> 01:50:24,215
Long live! Sage!

1322
01:50:24,325 --> 01:50:25,883
Long live! Sage!

1323
01:50:25,993 --> 01:50:27,426
Long live! Sage!

1324
01:50:27,528 --> 01:50:29,120
Long live! Sage!

1325
01:50:29,263 --> 01:50:30,662
Long live! Sage!

1326
01:50:30,765 --> 01:50:32,255
Long live! Sage!

1327
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:33,867
Long live! Sage!

1328
01:50:34,001 --> 01:50:35,491
Long live! Sage!

1329
01:50:35,603 --> 01:50:37,230
Long live! Sage!

1330
01:50:37,371 --> 01:50:38,895
Long live! Sage!

1331
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,439
Long live! Sage!

1332
01:50:40,541 --> 01:50:42,031
Long live! Sage!

1333
01:50:42,143 --> 01:50:43,610
Long live! Sage!

1334
01:50:43,711 --> 01:50:45,269
Long live! Sage!

1335
01:50:45,379 --> 01:50:46,937
Long live! Sage!

1336
01:50:47,048 --> 01:50:48,481
Long live! Sage!

1337
01:50:48,582 --> 01:50:49,640
Long live! Sage!

1338
01:50:49,784 --> 01:50:51,149
Silence!

1339
01:50:52,687 --> 01:50:57,624
Devotees! l have to tell
you an important thing today.

1340
01:50:58,592 --> 01:51:02,084
According to the command of my
childhood friend, Lord Krishna..

1341
01:51:02,663 --> 01:51:07,225
..all these days, l solved
your problems as per my capacity.

1342
01:51:07,835 --> 01:51:09,928
l cleared your spiritual doubts.

1343
01:51:10,071 --> 01:51:14,235
But now it's time for my Anthardanam.

1344
01:51:15,876 --> 01:51:19,107
lt's time for me to
go from your midst.

1345
01:51:21,315 --> 01:51:25,081
Last night Lord Sri
Krishna spoke to me and said..

1346
01:51:25,553 --> 01:51:29,853
Friend, how long will you
stay among these humans?

1347
01:51:29,990 --> 01:51:36,122
lt's enough. Go to Himalayas and
spend your time in meditation.

1348
01:51:36,964 --> 01:51:41,833
l'll come there myself and
take you to Brindavanam.

1349
01:51:42,203 --> 01:51:47,573
l'll take your leave. You
won't see me again in your life.

1350
01:51:47,675 --> 01:51:50,200
No! Don't leave us!

1351
01:51:50,311 --> 01:51:52,506
No! You shouldn't go!

1352
01:51:52,613 --> 01:51:54,444
Don't leave us, sage!

1353
01:51:54,548 --> 01:51:55,674
No, you can't leave us!

1354
01:51:55,783 --> 01:51:56,807
No, we won't let you go!

1355
01:51:56,984 --> 01:52:00,147
Stop! This is Lord Krishna's command.

1356
01:52:00,254 --> 01:52:01,516
Who are we to say no to him?

1357
01:52:01,655 --> 01:52:05,113
Can we go against the one
that controls the world?

1358
01:52:05,826 --> 01:52:08,192
Finally, l will tell
you just one thing.

1359
01:52:08,329 --> 01:52:10,695
Don't search for God here and there.

1360
01:52:10,798 --> 01:52:13,323
There is no bigger God
than your conscience.

1361
01:52:14,268 --> 01:52:15,997
God is within you.

1362
01:52:16,504 --> 01:52:18,734
Every good deed you do,
every good step you take..

1363
01:52:18,839 --> 01:52:24,607
..every responsibility that you
fulfill unselfishly, everything is God.

1364
01:52:25,312 --> 01:52:28,975
Love the people
around you. Share love.

1365
01:52:29,116 --> 01:52:31,607
Do anything for the
happiness of people.

1366
01:52:31,986 --> 01:52:35,422
May everyone live in happiness!

1367
01:52:38,592 --> 01:52:45,521
''O sage! O sage! You are great!''

1368
01:52:48,836 --> 01:52:58,541
''When you became sage,
Mother Earth felt very happy.''

1369
01:53:04,518 --> 01:53:07,009
Please don't go, sage!

1370
01:53:17,698 --> 01:53:19,393
Sage!

1371
01:53:20,901 --> 01:53:23,461
l've to speak to you, come inside.

1372
01:53:29,643 --> 01:53:32,305
Yes, sage. You said
you've to say something.

1373
01:53:32,446 --> 01:53:33,743
What is it, sage?

1374
01:53:34,215 --> 01:53:36,683
l don't know whether to say it or not.

1375
01:53:37,852 --> 01:53:39,911
lt's not my right to say it.

1376
01:53:40,721 --> 01:53:43,019
But it's not right to keep it too.

1377
01:53:43,123 --> 01:53:46,490
But you are my favorite disciple.
That's why l'm saying it.

1378
01:53:46,627 --> 01:53:49,027
No! Don't go ahead with this wedding!

1379
01:53:49,363 --> 01:53:52,196
Cancel your daughter's
wedding with that man !

1380
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:54,561
Why are you saying that, sage?

1381
01:53:54,668 --> 01:53:57,159
l had a future vision yesterday night.

1382
01:53:57,771 --> 01:54:00,171
l saw your daughter's future.

1383
01:54:00,574 --> 01:54:03,941
lf this wedding takes place,
she won't be happy.

1384
01:54:04,044 --> 01:54:07,536
Your daughter grew up with
lots of love and luxuries.

1385
01:54:07,648 --> 01:54:09,946
But she will have to
suffer utter poverty.

1386
01:54:10,117 --> 01:54:13,245
Sage!
- She will cry as long as she lives.

1387
01:54:13,387 --> 01:54:15,048
Understand why l'm saying this.

1388
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:20,217
My daughter loves him a lot.
l said yes to her yesterday.

1389
01:54:20,327 --> 01:54:23,592
lf l say no to her, she
will be very sad, sage.

1390
01:54:23,731 --> 01:54:26,359
Why do you want to
invite sadness to your house?

1391
01:54:27,301 --> 01:54:30,429
Even after knowing everything,
you might say yes to this wedding.

1392
01:54:30,571 --> 01:54:32,334
But l won't agree to it.

1393
01:54:32,673 --> 01:54:34,436
Alright, tell me the truth.

1394
01:54:34,542 --> 01:54:36,601
Did you like this match?

1395
01:54:36,944 --> 01:54:38,935
l don't like it, sage.

1396
01:54:39,079 --> 01:54:40,979
l agreed to it because you said so.

1397
01:54:41,115 --> 01:54:46,712
You don't like it, l don't
like it, God doesn't like it.

1398
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:50,620
Your daughter won't be happy
after marriage. Why all this?

1399
01:54:50,724 --> 01:54:54,524
No! Stop this marriage!
What is it, Shiva Prasad?

1400
01:54:54,662 --> 01:54:57,495
Now l have you to tell me
what's right and what's wrong.

1401
01:54:57,965 --> 01:54:59,830
What will l do after you go?

1402
01:54:59,934 --> 01:55:02,266
l thought about it.

1403
01:55:02,403 --> 01:55:07,136
And l found a wonderful match
that suits your daughter's stars.

1404
01:55:07,241 --> 01:55:08,538
Who is it, sage?

1405
01:55:08,676 --> 01:55:13,136
One of my favorite disciples,
Gajapathi's son.

1406
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,804
Do you agree to it?

1407
01:55:14,915 --> 01:55:17,907
Sage, you know everything.

1408
01:55:18,385 --> 01:55:20,182
You've seen the future too.

1409
01:55:20,287 --> 01:55:22,983
Whatever you say comes true.
How can it go wrong?

1410
01:55:23,057 --> 01:55:24,888
lt's your wish, sage.

1411
01:55:25,192 --> 01:55:26,591
Veda!

1412
01:55:26,694 --> 01:55:30,152
Yes, sage! - Gajapathi will
be outside. Call him inside.

1413
01:55:37,304 --> 01:55:38,999
Yes, sage.

1414
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:41,103
He is Shiva Prasad.

1415
01:55:43,177 --> 01:55:45,941
Gajapathi, l called you here to ask..

1416
01:55:46,046 --> 01:55:48,947
..if you will take his
daughter as your daughter-in-law.

1417
01:55:49,316 --> 01:55:50,840
Will you accept her?

1418
01:55:50,985 --> 01:55:54,580
Sage, l'll ask my son once and..

1419
01:55:54,722 --> 01:55:58,419
l'm asking you. Will
you accept or not?

1420
01:55:59,994 --> 01:56:01,928
Will you accept or not?

1421
01:56:02,029 --> 01:56:04,589
As you command, sage.

1422
01:56:06,467 --> 01:56:08,401
Now you can leave.

1423
01:56:17,611 --> 01:56:20,603
You look nice! Like a child snatcher!

1424
01:56:20,714 --> 01:56:22,978
My money!

1425
01:56:24,118 --> 01:56:25,881
Go with them, they will give you.

1426
01:56:39,566 --> 01:56:41,625
That's what happened.

1427
01:56:42,936 --> 01:56:45,461
Who are you? Why did l meet you?

1428
01:56:45,606 --> 01:56:48,336
Did you ever see me? l never saw you.

1429
01:56:49,043 --> 01:56:52,103
Why are you and
Gajapathi playing with my life?

1430
01:56:53,247 --> 01:56:56,182
Finished! My life is really messed up!

1431
01:56:56,550 --> 01:56:58,381
Some idiot married my Anjali.

1432
01:56:58,686 --> 01:57:00,517
Why should l live now?

1433
01:57:00,654 --> 01:57:02,952
Why are you sitting there? Get up!
Throw me under some train !

1434
01:57:03,057 --> 01:57:05,890
Anjali is not yet married. Her
wedding is at 3:30 this afternoon.

1435
01:57:06,026 --> 01:57:08,153
And that too, in Hyderabad.
- ln Hyderabad?

1436
01:57:13,067 --> 01:57:14,830
We need to tell this
to Anjali's father.

1437
01:57:15,202 --> 01:57:17,670
Whatever we want to do,
only you can make it possible.

1438
01:57:17,805 --> 01:57:20,330
He will listen only to you. And
he will get me married to Anjali.

1439
01:57:20,641 --> 01:57:21,699
Please come with me. C'mon !

1440
01:57:22,710 --> 01:57:25,338
l can't. l can't come there.

1441
01:57:25,746 --> 01:57:29,113
lf that Gajapathi sees me,
he will shoot me.

1442
01:57:29,416 --> 01:57:33,546
Forget that, if those photos are
leaked, Shiva Prasad will kill me.

1443
01:57:33,987 --> 01:57:35,113
Damn !

1444
01:57:35,556 --> 01:57:37,683
Okay, boss! We both will cut a deal.

1445
01:57:38,192 --> 01:57:40,626
You want to save your daughter.
l want my love to win.

1446
01:57:41,161 --> 01:57:42,219
There's only one way for it.

1447
01:57:47,634 --> 01:57:49,602
This is a very risky plan.

1448
01:57:50,204 --> 01:57:51,296
We should do it.

1449
01:57:54,374 --> 01:57:56,001
Keep this Krishna with you.

1450
01:57:58,145 --> 01:57:59,772
Everything will be good with us.

1451
01:58:00,114 --> 01:58:01,706
Oh no! l won't come, sir!

1452
01:58:01,849 --> 01:58:02,941
Come in !

1453
01:58:03,784 --> 01:58:05,308
Are you calling you for a party?

1454
01:58:05,419 --> 01:58:08,252
Oh God! Hello!

1455
01:58:08,355 --> 01:58:09,413
What did he do?

1456
01:58:09,523 --> 01:58:10,581
He is cheating people.

1457
01:58:10,691 --> 01:58:11,919
Cheating people?
- Yes.

1458
01:58:12,059 --> 01:58:14,084
Yes sir. This fool
says that he is NTR..

1459
01:58:14,194 --> 01:58:15,286
Mahesh Babu.

1460
01:58:15,596 --> 01:58:17,860
He said he's Mahesh Babu
and cheated a foreign girl.

1461
01:58:17,998 --> 01:58:20,990
And then he said that his mother
has cancer, brother has Aids..

1462
01:58:21,135 --> 01:58:22,193
No, swine flu, sir!

1463
01:58:22,536 --> 01:58:24,436
Swine flu, and he named many
other cinema difficulties..

1464
01:58:24,538 --> 01:58:25,869
..and took millions of rupees.

1465
01:58:26,607 --> 01:58:29,303
But when that girl came to
lndia and saw his beauty..

1466
01:58:29,409 --> 01:58:31,673
..she was fully shocked and
filed a cheating case against him.

1467
01:58:31,779 --> 01:58:33,178
That is not cheating, actually..

1468
01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:35,980
What's the matter? Do you
have too much fat in your body?

1469
01:58:36,250 --> 01:58:38,514
Don't you know that
l can't tolerate it..

1470
01:58:38,652 --> 01:58:40,643
..if any girl faces
injustice in my jurisdiction?

1471
01:58:40,754 --> 01:58:41,846
This is not fair, sir.

1472
01:58:41,955 --> 01:58:43,616
That is not your jurisdiction,
it's not our country too.

1473
01:58:43,724 --> 01:58:46,522
lt is America!
- Stop it!

1474
01:58:46,660 --> 01:58:50,027
lf any girl comes to my
station and lodges a complaint...

1475
01:58:50,464 --> 01:58:52,591
..America and Amberpet
are one and the same to me.

1476
01:58:52,733 --> 01:58:56,362
Take him and beat him so much
that he never cheats in his life.

1477
01:58:56,770 --> 01:58:58,362
Oh God!
- You are killing me!

1478
01:58:58,505 --> 01:58:59,938
Oh God!

1479
01:59:00,407 --> 01:59:02,432
Oh God!
- Let's go!

1480
01:59:03,710 --> 01:59:04,734
ls that all?

1481
01:59:04,845 --> 01:59:05,971
l think he wants more.

1482
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:08,748
That's not me. lt's my ringtone.
Cell phone ringtone, sir!

1483
01:59:09,349 --> 01:59:13,479
Movie, sir! Heroine, sir! Hero,
sir! Villain, sir!

1484
01:59:17,991 --> 01:59:19,117
Venkatesh !

1485
01:59:19,693 --> 01:59:20,853
Why are you here?

1486
01:59:21,195 --> 01:59:22,685
They beat me black and blue.

1487
01:59:22,830 --> 01:59:23,922
Cha!
- Oh God!

1488
01:59:24,064 --> 01:59:26,123
Sir, why did you bring my friend here?

1489
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:27,824
What's the matter, sir?

1490
01:59:27,968 --> 01:59:30,129
He's a big international criminal.

1491
01:59:30,237 --> 01:59:32,364
l'm not a criminal without a proof..
- Can't understand these girls.

1492
01:59:32,472 --> 01:59:33,700
He didn't do it purposely, sir.
Please leave him, sir.

1493
01:59:33,807 --> 01:59:34,899
Why does she still
love him after all this?

1494
01:59:35,008 --> 01:59:36,566
What's the matter?
- She wants you to leave him.

1495
01:59:36,710 --> 01:59:39,008
What do you mean?
- She says she loves him deeply.

1496
01:59:39,112 --> 01:59:42,240
Not for his beauty, what
did she say.. for his soul.

1497
01:59:42,316 --> 01:59:43,715
Not soul, sir.. it's my heart.

1498
01:59:44,418 --> 01:59:45,976
l'll skin you.
- She loved him for his heart.

1499
01:59:46,086 --> 01:59:48,111
She is not upset anymore.
She withdrew the case.

1500
01:59:48,255 --> 01:59:49,279
ls that so?

1501
01:59:49,423 --> 01:59:51,618
Sir, trust me. l'll make
sure that this never happens.

1502
01:59:52,526 --> 01:59:54,153
Till yesterday you said
it's love. What happened now?

1503
01:59:54,261 --> 01:59:55,694
You don't get involved unnecessarily.

1504
01:59:55,796 --> 01:59:57,058
l will not get married
to that American girl.

1505
01:59:57,164 --> 01:59:58,222
Why? What's the problem?

1506
01:59:58,365 --> 02:00:00,230
Why? Just as l showed her
Mahesh Babu's photograph..

1507
02:00:00,367 --> 02:00:01,698
..she showed me this girl's photo.

1508
02:00:02,269 --> 02:00:03,634
Jennifer Lopez.
- Did you recognize her?

1509
02:00:03,770 --> 02:00:05,135
Yes.
- l didn't recognize her.

1510
02:00:05,239 --> 02:00:07,469
The one that came is not the one
in this photograph. Look at her!

1511
02:00:09,042 --> 02:00:10,202
Hi!
- Huh?

1512
02:00:10,310 --> 02:00:12,870
Darling, please marry me.

1513
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:28,157
What is this dress?
What is this place?

1514
02:00:28,262 --> 02:00:30,924
Why are the police here?
Why did you bring me here?

1515
02:00:31,231 --> 02:00:33,199
Nothing. Just for a small adventure.

1516
02:00:33,667 --> 02:00:36,602
Adventure? l like
adventures from my childhood.

1517
02:00:36,703 --> 02:00:37,761
Shall we flatten the
tire of this vehicle?

1518
02:00:37,905 --> 02:00:39,031
Or shall we tear the
seat of that vehicle?

1519
02:00:39,139 --> 02:00:40,197
Tell me, what should we do now?

1520
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:42,740
Nothing like that. There are
some photos and negatives..

1521
02:00:42,876 --> 02:00:43,934
..that we need in the
Evidence Room inside the building.

1522
02:00:44,077 --> 02:00:45,408
We'll steal those
and come! That's all!

1523
02:00:45,512 --> 02:00:46,570
What?

1524
02:00:47,648 --> 02:00:48,740
What do you want?

1525
02:00:48,849 --> 02:00:50,043
Sir, we have to meet the DCP.

1526
02:00:50,183 --> 02:00:51,912
lt's not possible to meet him today.
- Good! Let's go! Let's go!

1527
02:00:52,019 --> 02:00:53,111
Shut up!

1528
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:55,120
We have to meet him today, sir.
Don't you understand what l'm saying?

1529
02:00:55,222 --> 02:00:56,280
Hello, sir!
- Good morning, sir!

1530
02:00:56,390 --> 02:00:57,482
Who are you?

1531
02:00:57,624 --> 02:00:59,114
l'm a volunteer from
Wish Maker Foundation.

1532
02:00:59,526 --> 02:01:02,120
He's a cancer patient,
sir. He will die very soon.

1533
02:01:02,663 --> 02:01:05,962
Our Foundation aims to fulfill
the last desires of dying people.

1534
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:08,559
He desires to be an ACP for a day.

1535
02:01:08,902 --> 02:01:11,063
We brought a permission
letter from the Commissioner too.

1536
02:01:20,714 --> 02:01:21,772
Gaurds!
- Sir!

1537
02:01:21,915 --> 02:01:23,507
These two will stay
here for the whole day.

1538
02:01:23,817 --> 02:01:25,375
For today, he is your ACP.

1539
02:01:25,919 --> 02:01:28,683
lt's so nice to be in your
favorite post for a day.

1540
02:01:28,989 --> 02:01:31,856
lf l get a chance, l'll
become the Home Minister..

1541
02:01:31,959 --> 02:01:34,223
..and give myself a
promotion and become an Sl.

1542
02:01:35,295 --> 02:01:36,660
What an idea, sir.

1543
02:01:36,763 --> 02:01:38,663
ACP wants to see this place. Show him.

1544
02:01:38,799 --> 02:01:40,926
This is Strong Room.
- Oh, it's nice.

1545
02:01:42,502 --> 02:01:44,094
Stop! This is Regard Room.

1546
02:01:44,504 --> 02:01:45,971
Oh !
- This is Evidence Room.

1547
02:01:48,976 --> 02:01:50,034
And this is our DCP's room.

1548
02:01:50,577 --> 02:01:51,669
Nice! Super!

1549
02:01:51,778 --> 02:01:53,405
There are weapons in this room.
- ls that so?

1550
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:55,475
Oh no! Don't beat me!
- Sit down !

1551
02:01:55,582 --> 02:01:57,948
No! Please stop!

1552
02:01:58,919 --> 02:02:00,750
ACP sir knows everything.
He's a smart man.

1553
02:02:00,887 --> 02:02:01,911
Yes!

1554
02:02:05,993 --> 02:02:07,085
Should l do all the work?

1555
02:02:07,728 --> 02:02:09,923
My hands are paining because
of beating him for one hour.

1556
02:02:10,230 --> 02:02:11,322
They started again.

1557
02:02:11,431 --> 02:02:13,365
Hey, didn't l beat him
for an hour earlier?

1558
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:14,524
Everyone should do their own work.

1559
02:02:14,835 --> 02:02:16,860
You beat him after making
him lie down on the ice.

1560
02:02:17,004 --> 02:02:18,665
Since he is lying down,
it's very easy.

1561
02:02:18,905 --> 02:02:21,965
Now l tied him up to beat him.
l'm so tired after beating him.

1562
02:02:22,242 --> 02:02:24,369
l shouldn't blame you. l
should blame the ACP..

1563
02:02:24,478 --> 02:02:26,070
..that ordered a cycle
thief to be beaten so badly.

1564
02:02:26,213 --> 02:02:27,271
l don't know all that.

1565
02:02:27,381 --> 02:02:28,439
Learn to respect seniors.
- Stop that!

1566
02:02:32,753 --> 02:02:34,311
Hey, Malli! You go and
beat him for half an hour.

1567
02:02:34,688 --> 02:02:36,918
They are beating him
brutally for stealing a cycle.

1568
02:02:37,057 --> 02:02:38,957
And you want to steal
from the Task Force.

1569
02:02:39,359 --> 02:02:40,917
Nothing will happen.
Nothing will happen to you.

1570
02:02:41,061 --> 02:02:42,323
l will be in trouble!

1571
02:02:42,929 --> 02:02:45,625
Why do you argue with him?
Take a blood pressure pill.

1572
02:02:48,068 --> 02:02:49,160
Where did these guys go?

1573
02:02:51,571 --> 02:02:53,766
There are so many boxes here.
Where do we search?

1574
02:03:14,294 --> 02:03:15,659
Hey, l found a movie script.

1575
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,195
We won't find it even if
we search the whole day.

1576
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:30,069
2010.. 2009.. 2008.

1577
02:03:30,410 --> 02:03:32,071
No, it won't be in these boxes.

1578
02:03:32,179 --> 02:03:34,841
Because they take these boxed
to court regularly for evidence.

1579
02:03:35,816 --> 02:03:37,340
He must have hid it in some old box.

1580
02:03:37,451 --> 02:03:38,645
We should search in
an old year. Correct.

1581
02:03:38,785 --> 02:03:39,945
lt will be in an old box for sure.

1582
02:03:40,821 --> 02:03:47,158
1998.. 97.. 86.. 78.. 77.

1583
02:03:48,095 --> 02:03:49,392
77 is the last one.

1584
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:14,978
Where did you go?

1585
02:04:15,088 --> 02:04:16,919
ACP sir came to this area for a round.

1586
02:04:17,023 --> 02:04:18,718
Alright. Let's go, l'll
show you another block.

1587
02:04:18,825 --> 02:04:22,317
No need. Our ACP sir is tired.
That's enough for today.

1588
02:04:22,429 --> 02:04:23,521
But the lady constables..

1589
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:24,722
What? Are you bored so
soon in a police job?

1590
02:04:24,831 --> 02:04:26,059
l will become a lawyer now.

1591
02:04:44,784 --> 02:04:46,274
Nothing like that. We made
arrangements all of a sudden..

1592
02:04:46,386 --> 02:04:47,512
..because it's an auspicious day.

1593
02:04:47,621 --> 02:04:49,418
You come soon. We are getting delayed.

1594
02:05:06,940 --> 02:05:07,964
Anjali!

1595
02:05:27,494 --> 02:05:29,291
Venkatesham! Please take me from here.

1596
02:05:29,930 --> 02:05:31,625
Please take me from here.

1597
02:05:32,132 --> 02:05:34,191
Where to?
- Wherever you like.

1598
02:05:34,301 --> 02:05:36,360
lf l stay here, they'll get
me married to someone else.

1599
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:38,895
No, l will marry you.

1600
02:05:39,005 --> 02:05:42,771
You don't understand. My
father already took the decision.

1601
02:05:43,810 --> 02:05:46,870
lf he decides something,
he won't listen to anyone.

1602
02:05:46,980 --> 02:05:49,642
He won't let you marry me.
Please, Venkatesham.

1603
02:05:50,450 --> 02:05:51,508
Take me from here.

1604
02:05:51,618 --> 02:05:54,746
Anjali, yesterday if l
knew where you were..

1605
02:05:55,188 --> 02:05:58,589
..l would've definitely
taken you along with me.

1606
02:05:59,793 --> 02:06:01,658
But l met someone yesterday.

1607
02:06:02,295 --> 02:06:03,785
When l saw how anxious
he was for his daughter..

1608
02:06:04,397 --> 02:06:07,093
..and how worried he was for
her safety, l can't do that now.

1609
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:10,226
l saw your father outside.
He is very happy.

1610
02:06:10,804 --> 02:06:15,241
He will give you to me with
that same happiness. Trust me.

1611
02:06:15,342 --> 02:06:18,243
Please try to understand.
That will never happen.

1612
02:06:18,478 --> 02:06:22,380
No, l'm telling you !
Trust me, it will happen.

1613
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:28,382
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1614
02:06:41,034 --> 02:06:42,126
Hey!
- Yes, brother!

1615
02:06:42,235 --> 02:06:44,032
What is happening there?
- Venkatesham came here..

1616
02:06:44,137 --> 02:06:46,071
..to make a scene, brother.
- Drag him and come to me

1617
02:06:48,541 --> 02:06:50,270
Sir! Sir! Sir!

1618
02:06:50,410 --> 02:06:52,435
How did he come in?
- Anjali is my life, sir.

1619
02:06:52,545 --> 02:06:55,275
Take him out. - l'll take good
care of her, please trust me.

1620
02:06:55,382 --> 02:06:56,713
Sir!

1621
02:06:56,816 --> 02:06:57,874
Sir!

1622
02:06:58,585 --> 02:07:00,052
Hail Sri Krishna!

1623
02:07:30,350 --> 02:07:32,580
Sage, you are here!

1624
02:07:36,323 --> 02:07:38,689
l came here to correct my mistake.

1625
02:07:38,792 --> 02:07:42,228
You correct our mistakes,
how can you make a mistake?

1626
02:07:42,362 --> 02:07:44,626
Shiva had mercy on Bhasmasura.

1627
02:07:45,031 --> 02:07:47,829
Yamaraj gave a gift to Sati Savitri.

1628
02:07:47,934 --> 02:07:50,266
Rama doubted Sita.

1629
02:07:50,970 --> 02:07:55,771
lf you start counting,
Gods did innumerable mistakes.

1630
02:07:56,776 --> 02:08:00,507
Making mistakes is not just
human nature, it is our nature too.

1631
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:03,977
Wow, how well you spoke
about right and wrong.

1632
02:08:04,117 --> 02:08:06,585
Vyasa said the same
thing in Bhagawatam..

1633
02:08:09,489 --> 02:08:13,892
And that too l made a mistake
with regard to my favorite disciple.

1634
02:08:14,094 --> 02:08:15,425
With regard to me?
- Yes.

1635
02:08:16,730 --> 02:08:18,220
With regard to your
daughter's marriage.

1636
02:08:18,465 --> 02:08:21,400
Mastan ! Listen
carefully to what l'm saying.

1637
02:08:21,501 --> 02:08:25,938
For the welfare of this world,
for the happiness of my devotees..

1638
02:08:26,573 --> 02:08:29,701
..when l was
meditating on the Himalayas..

1639
02:08:33,246 --> 02:08:36,738
''O Lord Krishna!

1640
02:08:38,251 --> 02:08:42,984
''O Lord Krishna!

1641
02:08:52,432 --> 02:08:56,801
''O Lord Krishna!

1642
02:08:57,404 --> 02:09:01,738
O Mukunda!

1643
02:09:01,875 --> 02:09:09,077
O Murari!''

1644
02:09:09,516 --> 02:09:12,076
Krishna!
- How are you my friend?

1645
02:09:12,886 --> 02:09:15,150
How will l be when l'm away from you?

1646
02:09:15,255 --> 02:09:16,916
l'm surviving like this.

1647
02:09:17,190 --> 02:09:18,452
Don't be sad, my friend.

1648
02:09:18,558 --> 02:09:20,116
From now on you will stay with me.

1649
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:21,750
Come, let's go to Vikuntam.

1650
02:09:24,731 --> 02:09:27,165
That was a funny thing
that happened that day.

1651
02:09:27,267 --> 02:09:29,633
When l looked back, Vasantha, who
started the fight, wasn't there.

1652
02:09:29,736 --> 02:09:31,203
And brother Balaram wasn't there too.

1653
02:09:31,304 --> 02:09:34,398
Even you slipped from there.
lt was just me who was trapped.

1654
02:09:34,507 --> 02:09:36,168
Yes, l remember that.

1655
02:09:36,276 --> 02:09:39,109
After that, mother Yashoda
was really upset with me.

1656
02:09:39,212 --> 02:09:41,976
l was so scared. A mother's
love is mother's love after all.

1657
02:09:42,081 --> 02:09:44,140
Yes, the word love
reminds me of one thing.

1658
02:09:44,250 --> 02:09:45,877
You know Shiva Prasad, right?

1659
02:09:45,985 --> 02:09:47,282
Who is Shiva Prasad?

1660
02:09:47,387 --> 02:09:49,878
Krishna, he is my favorite disciple.

1661
02:09:50,023 --> 02:09:52,014
His daughter fell in
love with someone.

1662
02:09:52,158 --> 02:09:53,887
He asked me if he
should get them married.

1663
02:09:53,993 --> 02:09:55,460
l told him to get them married.

1664
02:09:55,762 --> 02:10:01,394
After that, l saw that girl's future.
lt was not good at all.

1665
02:10:02,268 --> 02:10:03,895
So that's why l asked him
to cancel that marriage.

1666
02:10:04,003 --> 02:10:05,129
My friend!

1667
02:10:06,272 --> 02:10:09,105
Krishna! - How many times
will you make the same mistakes?

1668
02:10:09,209 --> 02:10:11,006
At one time, when me and
Radha loved each other deeply..

1669
02:10:11,110 --> 02:10:13,203
..you were the one who ruined
it and stopped our marriage.

1670
02:10:13,313 --> 02:10:15,406
And that's why you've
changed thousands of bodies..

1671
02:10:15,515 --> 02:10:17,005
..from Dwapara era to this day.

1672
02:10:17,450 --> 02:10:20,385
You should be in Brindavanam,
but you are on the earth.

1673
02:10:20,954 --> 02:10:22,717
Now you've done the same mistake.

1674
02:10:22,822 --> 02:10:24,551
You separated two lovers. Very bad!

1675
02:10:25,391 --> 02:10:30,351
Lord, l did it because l didn't
want Anjali to suffer her whole life.

1676
02:10:31,130 --> 02:10:34,930
What is past? What is present?
And what is future?

1677
02:10:35,368 --> 02:10:38,804
Am l not the past,
present and the future?

1678
02:10:39,839 --> 02:10:43,707
l'm changing that
girl's future right now.

1679
02:10:44,277 --> 02:10:47,371
lf she marries the man she loves,
she will live luxuriously..

1680
02:10:47,514 --> 02:10:50,813
..with all the happiness and
all the wealth in the world.

1681
02:10:51,417 --> 02:10:54,250
Difficulties will not be
able to come near her.

1682
02:10:54,621 --> 02:10:56,020
That's my responsibility.

1683
02:10:58,291 --> 02:11:00,782
Go! Go immediately and
correct your mistake.

1684
02:11:00,927 --> 02:11:03,259
Till then you will be
prohibited from entering Vikuntam.

1685
02:11:03,363 --> 02:11:04,762
Krishna!
- Go!

1686
02:11:07,333 --> 02:11:08,698
Look, Shiva Prasad!

1687
02:11:09,802 --> 02:11:10,860
Sage!

1688
02:11:11,404 --> 02:11:13,634
l never asked you for anything.

1689
02:11:14,474 --> 02:11:16,271
But today l'm asking on my behalf..

1690
02:11:16,509 --> 02:11:19,171
..and on behalf of my friend,
Sri Krishna.

1691
02:11:20,146 --> 02:11:24,606
Get your daughter married to
the one she loves, Venkatesham.

1692
02:11:25,885 --> 02:11:26,943
Sir!

1693
02:11:28,154 --> 02:11:29,246
Go!
- Okay, sir!

1694
02:11:29,956 --> 02:11:33,653
Stop your drama! You are a God
and God himself told you, is it?

1695
02:11:33,793 --> 02:11:36,557
Brother-in-law!
- What are you doing?

1696
02:11:37,063 --> 02:11:38,223
We have a wedding in one hour.

1697
02:11:38,331 --> 02:11:39,491
There are so many
people in the wedding tent.

1698
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:41,897
He is talking rubbish about
Himalaya mountains and Vikuntam.

1699
02:11:42,035 --> 02:11:43,400
What are you talking, Gajapathi?

1700
02:11:43,670 --> 02:11:45,797
Please sir, listen to me.

1701
02:11:46,205 --> 02:11:47,672
l don't say anything without a proof.

1702
02:11:48,374 --> 02:11:50,171
l have complete evidence.

1703
02:11:51,744 --> 02:11:53,302
He didn't cheat just you and me.

1704
02:11:53,846 --> 02:11:56,371
But he cheated many
people with the name of God.

1705
02:11:57,684 --> 02:11:59,481
We received many complaints about him.

1706
02:11:59,719 --> 02:12:02,688
We started an enquiry.
And we got to know that..

1707
02:12:02,956 --> 02:12:06,448
He is the one that killed the
old man in the railway station.

1708
02:12:08,494 --> 02:12:10,826
After that he started the
drama of entering another body.

1709
02:12:11,364 --> 02:12:13,355
Photos regarding that are in this box.

1710
02:12:14,233 --> 02:12:17,066
Since he came to know that his
true identity will be revealed..

1711
02:12:17,170 --> 02:12:20,367
..he tried to escape in the
name of Anthardanam rubbish.

1712
02:12:21,341 --> 02:12:24,504
Finally, l don't know what
he thought, but he came here.

1713
02:12:24,644 --> 02:12:25,872
Hail Sri Krishna!

1714
02:12:25,979 --> 02:12:29,506
Stop it! That's your last Sri Krishna!

1715
02:12:29,782 --> 02:12:30,908
Here is the evidence!

1716
02:12:35,655 --> 02:12:36,713
Sage!

1717
02:12:54,040 --> 02:12:57,134
What is this?
- lt's the power of sage's amulet.

1718
02:13:01,614 --> 02:13:03,844
Sage tested our faith too.

1719
02:13:04,817 --> 02:13:06,910
He told us that he is not God at all.

1720
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:10,617
But we didn't believe him.
Our faith is pure.

1721
02:13:10,723 --> 02:13:13,715
We passed in his test. But you failed.

1722
02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:14,952
You failed.

1723
02:13:18,398 --> 02:13:22,391
The eyes with which you see are
according to the heart that believes.

1724
02:13:22,502 --> 02:13:25,835
We all worshipped the sage as a God.

1725
02:13:26,039 --> 02:13:29,475
But you wanted to
prove that he is a devil.

1726
02:13:29,575 --> 02:13:31,372
Did you see who won?

1727
02:13:31,644 --> 02:13:33,305
Why are we still
talking to him? Beat him!

1728
02:13:33,446 --> 02:13:35,505
C'mon !
- Let's get him! Don't leave him!

1729
02:13:38,051 --> 02:13:39,746
What are you seeing? Go and punch him!

1730
02:13:45,425 --> 02:13:49,384
Beat him! Don't leave him!

1731
02:13:57,570 --> 02:13:58,696
Sage!

1732
02:13:59,639 --> 02:14:01,300
That's me!
- Oh ! - C'mon !

1733
02:14:11,150 --> 02:14:12,447
The keys are with him.

1734
02:14:15,188 --> 02:14:17,679
Try this, sir. lt was in the
box along with photographs.

1735
02:14:24,897 --> 02:14:27,422
Sage has more money than the banks.
- Hold this!

1736
02:14:59,132 --> 02:15:01,362
This million is for me to live.

1737
02:15:01,834 --> 02:15:03,859
And this million is
for my girl's operation.

1738
02:15:04,003 --> 02:15:05,061
That's enough for me.

1739
02:15:06,172 --> 02:15:08,538
Take the remaining money
and give it to Venkatesham.

1740
02:15:08,608 --> 02:15:10,576
Ask him to build a
hospital for small children.

1741
02:15:11,544 --> 02:15:14,069
Tell him that from
plaster to cancer medicines..

1742
02:15:14,180 --> 02:15:15,204
..everything should be
given free of cost there.

1743
02:15:15,381 --> 02:15:16,848
All this money to Venkatesham?

1744
02:15:16,949 --> 02:15:18,541
l trust him completely.

1745
02:15:20,953 --> 02:15:25,447
From that day, no one
saw Prasad alias Sage.

1746
02:15:25,858 --> 02:15:30,386
Maybe no one will know where
he is and what he is doing.

1747
02:15:32,265 --> 02:15:34,961
'Two years later' 'Kohima, Nagaland'

1748
02:15:35,101 --> 02:15:36,125
lt's very fresh, sir.

1749
02:15:40,239 --> 02:15:41,399
Sir!
- Huh?

1750
02:15:41,641 --> 02:15:43,108
We are building a temple,
give donations, sir.

1751
02:15:43,242 --> 02:15:44,573
A temple? For whom?

1752
02:15:44,710 --> 02:15:45,938
For this God, sir.

1753
02:15:49,982 --> 02:15:52,007
Who is he?
- Don't you know him, sir?

1754
02:15:52,151 --> 02:15:54,119
He is Another Body Sage! He
has lots of miraculous powers.

1755
02:15:54,253 --> 02:15:55,345
Where are you building the temple?

1756
02:15:56,122 --> 02:15:58,181
Somewhere nearby, sir.

1757
02:16:04,697 --> 02:16:05,755
Sir!

1758
02:16:05,898 --> 02:16:06,990
Here!

1759
02:16:10,703 --> 02:16:12,034
Dad!
- Huh?

1760
02:16:12,171 --> 02:16:14,298
Why did you give him so much money?

1761
02:16:15,541 --> 02:16:17,975
That same God gave me for your operation.
