00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,700
Father!

4
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,900
Father!

5
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,480
Go!

6
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,700
Go!

7
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:09,180
Oh long distance traveler

8
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:17,590
Do take me along too

9
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,620
I have been left alone

10
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,660
Thief! Please save me!

11
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,030
I'm a traveler who has lost his way.

12
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,300
Everyone left me.

13
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,720
Life has brought me to death's door.

14
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,730
Give me shelter for a night.
Just for a night.

15
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,700
Oh long distance traveler

16
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,820
Do take me along too

17
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,450
I have been left alone

18
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:33,280
Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief!

19
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,650
Thief!

20
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,540
Master, can I dare to
ask what my fault was?

21
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,130
Fault! You are blindly lost...

22
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,720
in the world of light and spirit.

23
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,790
Over here, the dead reside.

24
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,520
Living beings can't stay here.

25
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,430
You mean she...

26
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,830
She's the Goddess.
She's the Almighty.

27
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,370
She had come to assure
this impatient heart.

28
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,740
While supporting you,
I have lost my support.

29
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,530
The ones who were to come have left.

30
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,910
They will never come now.

31
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,360
Please tell me,
where do they come from?

32
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,780
I'll risk my life and get them back.

33
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:47,160
You cannot get them.
Nobody can get them here.

34
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:57,180
They live on the moon.
A man cannot touch them.

35
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,320
My heart shudders on mentioning it.

36
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,390
Forty years ago...

37
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,920
Accept our greetings

38
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,710
Accept my greetings and
the message from the heart

39
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,790
Take the drink of love

40
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,150
Oh traveler on the uran khatola
(uran khatola - magical flying vehicle)

41
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,480
Accept my greetings and
the message from the heart

42
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,660
Take the drink of love

43
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,190
Oh traveler on the uran khatola

44
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,390
Flying with the wind,
in the shadow of the clouds...

45
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,740
to which village will you go?

46
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,940
Down here's the earth.
The world is beautiful

47
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,360
My heart is certain
that you'll come

48
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,810
Accept my greetings and
the message from the heart

49
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,020
Take the drink of love

50
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,400
Oh traveler on the uran khatola

51
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,290
You're flying high.
Your life depends on the wings

52
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,930
There's a storm ahead,
don't move on

53
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,100
The destination is far off.
You're tired and despondant

54
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,620
But you will come.
I know you will come

55
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,740
Accept my greetings and
the message from the heart

56
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,890
Take the drink of love

57
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,410
Oh traveler on the uran khatola

58
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,700
Please come over,
oh traveler on the flight

59
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,660
Oh traveler, please come over

60
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,900
Run! Water! Water!

61
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,310
- Run, run!
- Water!

62
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,600
Soni, he's gasping for breath.

63
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,010
I'll get the medicine.

64
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,976
Nothing to see. C'mon.
We need air. Move.

65
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,930
Move away! Have you no manners?

66
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,180
Who are you?

67
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm not dead I suppose.

68
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,980
What place is this? Who got me here?

69
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,690
Stranger, have you
regained your senses?

70
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,970
- Who are you?
- Me?

71
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,030
My name is Heera but
people have made me miserable.

72
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,260
Who's she? Over there.

73
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,610
Over there! It's a pillar.

74
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,990
But I was seeing something else.

75
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,400
You have survived but
have lost your sight.

76
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,930
Your eye sight is
even better than mine.

77
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,650
She's my sister.
The one who saved your life.

78
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,860
- Can't she speak?
- Yes, she can

79
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,930
But you can't hear her voice.

80
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,930
- Why so?
- It's the law of the land.

81
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,450
Girls over here don't
speak to unknown men.

82
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,200
Barring the man they
choose for their marriage.

83
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,150
- The King has summoned.
- We'll be right there.

84
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,360
The King of this region
has summoned you. Come.

85
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,480
Who's he?

86
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,330
My father. The most
powerful in this kingdom.

87
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,750
The Queen and people of
the kingdom bow to him.

88
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,150
Let's go.

89
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,740
Lord Tanga.

90
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,860
When sin in our
country crosses its limit...

91
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,350
his mouth begins to
spew fire instead of smoke.

92
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,040
And then comes such a storm that...

93
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,180
devastates the whole region.

94
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,240
Heetu!

95
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,800
Oh God! Stranger,
let's get out of here.

96
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,280
This fool has
chosen me as her groom.

97
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,900
- What a woman! Let's go.
- He has fled!

98
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,370
I won't spare you the next time.

99
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,780
The land has a severe
punishment for every offence.

100
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,770
They had taken false oaths.

101
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,710
Any woman who's
suspected of promiscuity...

102
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,590
is made to walk on fire.

103
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,690
Boy, strangers
aren't allowed to stay...

104
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,460
here for more than eight days.

105
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,610
You'll have to go.

106
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,420
Father, all the exit
routes are blocked.

107
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,020
The order to leave
in this condition...

108
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,020
is like a death sentence.

109
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,760
Not an issue.

110
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,530
I fear a life which is
unable to repay one's favor.

111
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,230
They both have saved my life.

112
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,930
Boy, all I have is a blessing and...

113
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,900
not the power to break the law.

114
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,690
You'll have to visit the Queen.

115
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,150
He still has to go.

116
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,340
Shyamu, you should
respect the religious...

117
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,180
feelings before interfering.

118
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,150
I beg your pardon. These strangers
come here to cheat the girls.

119
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,370
I can't give
anyone permission...

120
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,000
to play with the
dignity of the land.

121
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,360
- The Queen has the right to that.
- Oh!

122
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,940
It's for Soni.

123
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,920
Heetu, please take him to the Queen.

124
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,010
The complainant may enter.

125
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,146
Oh Queen, the stranger...

126
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,130
comes to disturb the
peace of the kingdom.

127
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,040
He should be asked
to leave the kingdom.

128
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,780
That shall happen.

129
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,049
Oh!

130
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,190
Tell me.

131
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,220
- I'm a stranger.
- It's evident from the voice.

132
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,990
I wanted permission
to stay on over here.

133
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,760
Why?

134
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,820
As the land and the
people in it are beautiful.

135
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,570
And then there's no
way to return either.

136
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,180
The heart wishes that...

137
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,840
What the heart wants
is difficult to get.

138
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,580
Take him away.

139
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,040
Can I not even request mercy?

140
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,520
No. You're related
to danger and tyranny.

141
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,560
Outsiders are con men.

142
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,800
Free him.

143
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,700
Where do you hail from?

144
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,070
India.

145
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,940
What is famous about that place?

146
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,790
Love and music.

147
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,820
You'll play some?

148
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,440
If I get the permission to stay on.

149
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,730
You have the permission.

150
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,380
You may go.

151
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,750
Stay away from the girls over here.

152
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,920
Our law is very
strict for the outsiders.

153
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,700
You may go.

154
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,610
You are scared?

155
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,910
Don't be.

156
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,760
Things have immensely
improved with your arrival.

157
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,330
Hasn't it?

158
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,190
The moon wasn't that beautiful.

159
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,490
The flowers weren't that fragrant.

160
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,610
You have brought spring into my life.

161
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,160
I hope you won't take
away the peace of mind.

162
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,190
These mountains, this city...

163
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,320
these clouds...

164
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,630
these fountains,
do you like them?

165
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,450
And me?

166
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,110
The moon is the
witness that I like you.

167
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,406
There came a guest at home

168
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,680
He's become a beloved and
there's been no introduction yet

169
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,970
He's very cruel. He's very cruel

170
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,140
There came a guest at home

171
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,130
He first entered the eyes
and then the heart

172
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,910
He brought moonlight into my life

173
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:59,260
He peeps through the
moon's window, standing away

174
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,646
He teases me and troubles me

175
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,920
The mind becomes dishonest

176
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,040
He's very cruel. He's very cruel

177
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,270
There came a guest at home

178
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,040
He's become a beloved and
there's been no introduction yet

179
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,280
He's very cruel. He's very cruel

180
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,640
The naughty one speaks
only through gestures

181
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,730
My heart beats violently

182
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,680
The eyes flutter

183
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,720
The eyes play havoc
and hurt the heart

184
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,810
I happen to lose my sleep

185
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,450
The cruel one pretending to be
innocent shouldn't feel proud

186
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,450
He's very cruel. He's very cruel

187
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,910
There came a guest at home

188
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,470
He's become a beloved and
there's been no introduction yet

189
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,950
He's very cruel. He's very cruel

190
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,240
Heetu, didn't you tell me once
that it's not safe to talk to girls?

191
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,510
But what if the girl
herself happens to talk?

192
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,856
You're asking?

193
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,500
You should get hold
of her feet at once.

194
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,490
You should rub them
on your forehead...

195
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,740
and one should cry a lot
to win over their heart.

196
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,250
But then what about
the rule of your land?

197
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,420
That ends with the
girl's acceptance.

198
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,860
The Queens' approval
order and congratulations.

199
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,710
- I didn't get you.
- Oh!

200
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,180
I hope you have borne in
mind the condition...

201
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,180
of your permission.

202
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,820
What condition?

203
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,300
Why hide the fact?

204
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,260
The guest mansion is decorated
and waiting for you.

205
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,846
- Let's go.
- Please forgive me.

206
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,590
Brother, brother,
you'll have to go.

207
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,270
The Queen's order is not overruled.

208
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,840
Not over there. This is your place.

209
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,970
I do recognize my place.

210
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,220
Outsider, praise me.

211
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,920
It's difficult to praise, praise.

212
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,290
What should I praise?

213
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,900
My hair.

214
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:41,200
Outsider, you are my guest.

215
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,270
Would you do me a favor?

216
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,576
You just have to order.

217
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,780
Sing a song that sets me on fire.

218
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,230
- You want to get burned?
- Yes, stranger.

219
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,310
Sing. Sing a song.

220
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,280
A song that will awaken my desires.

221
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:34,680
Tread the paths of love carefully

222
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:50,910
The one who has reached here
has lost it all

223
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:05,110
Tread the paths of love carefully

224
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:19,730
No one has reached
the destination of love

225
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:37,130
The steps falter after
walking just a little distance

226
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:51,630
Tread the paths of love carefully

227
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:06,320
The Spring looks for us

228
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:26,230
Where have I landed from the sky?

229
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:39,940
Tread the paths of love carefully

230
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:54,030
A heart full of desires
shouldn't break

231
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,700
Don't shift your aim
while shooting the arrow

232
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:24,610
Tread the paths of love carefully

233
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,390
Girl, was it you who shot the arrow?

234
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,990
Yes.

235
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,090
A cruel arrow
escaped from my quiver.

236
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,540
I shot the arrow to save it.

237
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,840
Let her hands be cut off.

238
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,286
Take her away.

239
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,270
Queen, I request mercy
as she's my friend.

240
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,650
A friend! Like what?

241
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,490
She saved my life when I was lying...

242
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,490
in the blazing fire and smoke.

243
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,630
Do you love your friend a lot?

244
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,530
A few people are born to love.

245
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:09,430
- Free her. What's your name?
- Name... yes.

246
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,770
My name's Shibu.

247
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,270
Shibu means love with one's heart.

248
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,070
Oh yes, something like that.

249
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,580
You learn it.

250
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,090
Shibu?

251
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,170
I'm unfortunate.

252
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,480
It's the frogs that get hooked
and not the fish.

253
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,810
Heetu!

254
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,880
Your fish is here.

255
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,220
Oh my! What a
weird nose you possess!

256
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,650
She won't let the innocent live.

257
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,690
Heetu! It's not a rose
but a piece of my heart.

258
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,090
Here, I throw my heart at you.

259
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,920
Heetu! It's not a cabbage
but my tiny lung.

260
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,790
I throw my lungs at you!

261
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,620
Dear, now move away!
You'll start weeping if I hold you.

262
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,200
She's troubling a soul which is
already troubled on the banks.

263
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,890
No games! No games!

264
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:23,969
You don't even cut your nails.
You've scratched my body!

265
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,240
Inauspicious!

266
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,130
Is she a woman or an adhesive!

267
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,160
She's just getting closer!
Move away!

268
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,115
Look, dear, it's too much now!

269
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,339
One shouldn't joke near the
river bank. Please go away.

270
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,720
She stinks!
She doesn't even wash her mouth!

271
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,230
Filthy one! Move away!

272
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,450
Bear! God!

273
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:49,169
Heetu!

274
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:15,380
Listen. Come to the fort
on hearing my voice.

275
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,710
The voice will be from my
heart and life shall pass by.

276
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,920
Stop playing the music.
It's got pain in it and no remedy.

277
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,360
The moon's on a high today.

278
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,010
The waves of the stream
are waiting for the ocean.

279
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:10,840
Tylandi, I love both,
waves and youthfulness.

280
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,380
The security?

281
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,990
Don't worry.

282
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,680
The moonlight will guard me today.

283
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,670
Play safe...

284
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:15,110
with the river's high waves

285
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:24,180
Thousands of hearts will burn
and the water will catch fire

286
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:35,970
Play with neither
the storm nor the banks

287
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:41,460
Come near me
and play with my heart

288
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,830
Don't play with the storms

289
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,080
The waves of passion tell you...

290
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,370
get the boat of love to the shore

291
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:38,780
Walk along in the world of love

292
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:46,490
Play with the destination,
now that you have found the way

293
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:51,910
Come near me
and play with my heart

294
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:55,210
Don't play with the storms

295
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,940
The fire in the heart can't
be extinguished with water

296
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:26,200
It'll keep spreading
if you try doing so

297
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:37,420
Don't bother about
what the world will say

298
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:45,330
Play with difficulty,
if love is difficult

299
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:50,790
Come near me and
play with my heart

300
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:56,470
Play with neither the
storm nor the banks

301
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:30,330
Thank you.
Those clothes are mine.

302
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,120
It's not a voice in your throat,
but magic.

303
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,650
I really liked your song.

304
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,830
I mean that...

305
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,030
I know it all.

306
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,060
What you couldn't express,
you said in song.

307
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:05,570
I sang this song for...

308
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,840
I know.

309
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,150
It was for me.

310
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,780
It was for love. It was for love.

311
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:17,910
- I'm a Queen and I am Love, too.
- You...

312
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,280
I didn't know that you were here...

313
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:24,160
I'm present everywhere.
I'm present in every color.

314
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,540
Especially, when the moon's...

315
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,750
- at it's brilliant best.
- Right.

316
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,840
- I come to be greeted by the waves.
- You did?

317
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:36,630
Even I become a wave
getting mingled with them.

318
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,440
Lend me support.

319
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,330
Look, please don't get me wrong.

320
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,660
- I, actually...
- I'll never get you wrong.

321
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,100
No, no...

322
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,450
- Please listen to me.
- I've heard all I need.

323
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,400
I had come for you but the Queen...

324
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,070
The Queen bought you up.

325
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,170
You made false promises.

326
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,160
You only have a handsome face...

327
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,510
but you don't have a good heart.

328
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,120
You don't have a good heart!
You don't have a good heart!

329
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,346
Soni, don't be crazy.
Try to understand me.

330
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,590
Leave me.

331
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:25,500
I built a palace
and you set it ablaze.

332
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:30,420
I wish there was nothing
like love in this world!

333
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,700
Brother! The stranger is innocent!

334
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,470
Brother! No!

335
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:57,140
He can't be a fool as he has cheated.
He'll have to die.

336
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,550
Brother! No!

337
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,050
- I've chosen the outsider.
- What!

338
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,080
If there is any fault, it is mine.

339
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,990
Why have you
refrained from hitting me?

340
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,280
My life and death depend on her.

341
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,830
Stranger, nobody can separate
the two of you from now on.

342
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:31,840
Play with neither the
storm nor the banks

343
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,340
Come near me and
play with my heart

344
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:40,290
Don't play with the storms and...

345
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,950
- Oh, brother!
- Soni!

346
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,050
- I feel like singing today.
- No, no...

347
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,680
Crazy, not now. I'm afraid you
wouldn't be able to finish it.

348
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,660
- Why not?
- It's because he's an outsider.

349
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,830
First get permission from father.

350
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,320
Then you can sing a
song and even light...

351
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,710
the auspicious lamps.

352
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,980
Oh, brother!

353
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,210
I want such make up today that the...

354
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,250
beloved falls for me
the moment he sees me.

355
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:09,410
Today I want a necklace...

356
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,280
that makes an impact on his heart.

357
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,190
Let me wear it.
It's my victory today.

358
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,060
It's my victory today.

359
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,080
- Who do you think you have won over?
- I won't say.

360
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,550
- Who was he?
- I won't tell!

361
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,210
That's fine.

362
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:44,250
He's the king of a far off country!
Oh yes!

363
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,990
You'll feel jealous on seeing him.

364
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,720
- I'll be jealous?
- Yes.

365
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,700
Even I came here
searching for my sweetheart.

366
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:02,830
- Queen?
- Yes, a queen.

367
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,900
The flower-like cheeks,
pearl-like teeth.

368
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,010
Even you'll feel jealous
when you happen to see her.

369
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,750
Soni.

370
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,330
Give a call as I have come for you.

371
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,060
I, too, have come for you.

372
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,940
I knew that you must be
waiting for me even today.

373
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:41,320
- You see, but...
- What do you want?

374
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,750
We're both here and there's love, too.

375
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,940
- There's somebody else too.
- Who's that?

376
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,220
The Almighty.

377
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:01,000
You fear God.
Don't you fear love?

378
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,700
Come with me.

379
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:08,640
- I, excuse me. I have got to...
- Don't waste time.

380
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,700
I've come to take you.

381
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,840
It's a special guest room of mine.

382
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,310
No other person can come here.

383
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,630
Not even air is
permitted to pass by this.

384
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,470
I light these lamps
and it's I who extinguishes them.

385
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:29,170
- What are you looking at?
- Your grandeur.

386
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:33,670
Of what are you thinking?

387
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,066
The consequences.

388
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:39,090
Don't ponder over it.

389
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:41,480
Those who fear the waves
are stuck at the shore.

390
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,950
Those who jump into
the sea get the pearls.

391
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:53,930
Life is a beautiful toy.
Don't fear it but learn to play.

392
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,570
The game of love
can't be played everywhere.

393
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:06,740
The one who doesn't hold
hands in life usually gets lost.

394
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,780
Come. Let's strike a bargain
for our lives.

395
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,080
A bargain is made for goods,
not human beings.

396
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:20,690
You haven't witnessed
the world's strength.

397
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,840
It can buy everything.

398
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,230
But not the man's heart.

399
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,290
It sells itself for free
if it so desires.

400
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,140
No wealth in the world can
buy it if it decides not to.

401
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,280
You carry attitude.

402
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,500
At first, I think
showing attitude is good.

403
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,570
This is the result
of spying on a palace.

404
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,340
Take her away.

405
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,110
Maid, someone's a
maid of love today.

406
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:18,040
Maid, only music won't do today.

407
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,160
A voice should accompany it too.

408
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:18,340
Don't go leaving my heart

409
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:24,460
Don't get deceived as the
world is very dishonest

410
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,760
Oh beloved, the
world is very dishonest

411
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,430
Strange

412
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:52,510
I'm the first souvenir of love

413
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:04,890
I narrate the heart's
story through the eyes today

414
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:15,590
Listen to me as I beg of you

415
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,420
Dear, I'm requesting you

416
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,976
Be with me all through
life and don't hurt me

417
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,080
Beloved, I don't have respect

418
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:41,280
Oh beloved, the
world is very dishonest

419
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:45,270
Don't go leaving my heart

420
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:51,420
Don't get deceived as the
world is very dishonest

421
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,430
Strange

422
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:07,950
It's difficult to speak
a few nice words here

423
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,940
Never disclose your
secrets to the world

424
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,560
Love here is a charade

425
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:36,130
Nobody's a friend here

426
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,266
The world today has turned vile

427
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:51,970
Make it a better place
as my soul is confused

428
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:57,246
Oh beloved, the
world is very dishonest

429
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:01,100
Don't go leaving my heart

430
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:07,240
Don't get deceived as the
world is very dishonest

431
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:09,280
Strange

432
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:14,630
Cease, maid. The stone didn't melt,
but only became harder.

433
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:16,880
Come, dear.

434
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,480
Have you any idea
what trouble you're in?

435
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:55,770
I'm aware. A woman is almost
dead anyway. Now she got killed.

436
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,430
I've come to save you.

437
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:59,650
The one who killed has
left with the Queen.

438
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,790
He didn't go but you let him go.

439
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,820
Do you see these mute pictures?

440
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:30,390
- I'm even hearing their voice.
- Voice?

441
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,940
But I haven't heard it until now.

442
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:36,670
A heart's voice is heard
through another heart.

443
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,180
Not through ears.

444
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,130
Even your thoughts are nice,
just like your face.

445
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,720
You have seen it.

446
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,010
It'd have been better if I had died!

447
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,460
Take me back!

448
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,120
Queen, what's this?

449
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,680
The gift of love.

450
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:13,490
- I can't accept it.
- Do so.

451
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,100
It's not a ring but my love.

452
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:22,300
The one who accepts it becomes mine.

453
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:28,210
And the one who rejects it
has to lose many things.

454
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,160
Soni, you laugh. Laugh heartily!

455
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:33,130
The outsider now belongs to you.

456
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,130
- It's not possible.
- Why not?

457
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,276
Your brother went there to
check his sister's future.

458
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,860
Even Father has given permission.

459
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,060
Sing! Sing songs of joy!

460
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:46,571
Take this. I have even
brought the bridal costume for you.

461
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,750
I've even lit the auspicious lamps.

462
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:53,410
Extinguish these lamps!
Extinguish these lamps!

463
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:56,800
Soni! Soni!

464
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:59,250
I don't wish to dream.

465
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:08,380
Soni! Soni!

466
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,680
Crazy girl! You're crying
at the time of celebration?

467
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:13,960
C'mon get up.

468
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,400
The same young guard has come...

469
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:19,430
and he has some
important message.

470
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:21,430
Bring him in.

471
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:32,330
- Guard...
- You have come?

472
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,380
- You got permission?
- Sit down.

473
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:35,680
Sit down.

474
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,980
I asked you to stop meeting me.

475
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,020
No! I'll meet the Queen.

476
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,916
I got the permission
with great difficulty.

477
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,780
- That was a favor by you, maid...
- Hey...

478
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,790
Don't address me as a maid!

479
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:51,190
That won't do. Bring it.
Get me my reward.

480
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,790
Oh Lord, I'm ready to even die
for you! What else do you want?

481
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:56,940
Those who kill cannot
die for someone else!

482
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,436
I'm asking, have you gotten married?

483
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:04,310
I keep trying to sell off my
heart but there's no buyer!

484
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,440
What kind of buyer
are you looking for?

485
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,076
Just like you.

486
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,310
You appear a simpleton but you...

487
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:13,790
are quite smart.

488
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,570
Listen, don't mention this to the Queen.

489
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,610
- We'll talk about each other later.
- Okay.

490
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:23,130
Where are you going?
It's a woman's rule over here.

491
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,920
Follow me.

492
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,830
Hey, not that way.

493
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:32,690
Look, don't nod in front of her.

494
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,220
Keep your head bowed.

495
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:39,990
And yes, salute with a little bow.

496
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,580
Move fast.

497
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:52,760
Shibu.

498
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,360
You must've got the
message of the stranger.

499
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,670
My friend has
returned this gift of yours.

500
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:12,600
He has also said that he
can't fulfill your wish.

501
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,130
You can go.

502
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,000
Don't waste time.

503
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,590
The gift has reached the
person it belonged to.

504
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,610
- But who took it away?
- Me!

505
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:04,090
Don't sell yourself so easily.
Your value is much higher.

506
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,680
Get going from here
by tomorrow morning.

507
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,246
This is the last and
final order of the Queen.

508
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:25,850
How can the order be fulfilled?
The roads are blocked.

509
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:27,690
The path to life
must've got blocked.

510
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:29,580
That of death is open I suppose.

511
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:31,696
No matter where you go,
no matter how you go...

512
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,266
just get lost from this kingdom!

513
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:35,330
- Please listen to me.
- I can't listen to anything!

514
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:39,340
You'll be responsible for
the outcome if you don't leave!

515
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:41,340
Take this, the orders of the Queen!

516
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:49,320
Disguised as a man I could do what...

517
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,240
I couldn't as a woman.

518
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,340
The stranger's life's in danger.

519
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,420
The stranger's life's in danger?

520
01:02:56,990 --> 01:03:02,090
Yes. I'm going to light the
lamps with all my joy today.

521
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:09,070
So that he gets blessed
and I become a pauper for life.

522
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:11,230
- Who's that dacoit?
- The Queen.

523
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,450
- The Queen!
- Yes.

524
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,500
The queen can play with
someone's life but not the heart.

525
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,360
You go, you stay with the stranger.

526
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:23,640
I'm going to father.

527
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:37,840
- Two complainants...
- I won't meet anybody today.

528
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:41,620
- The young hunter.
- Tell him to leave.

529
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,670
Even the stranger is with him.

530
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:49,640
Let them come.

531
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:57,220
Why have you come now, stranger?

532
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,180
To ask about the duty of the Queen.

533
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:01,510
One is supposed to obey
the orders in my kingdom...

534
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,480
and not question my decisions.

535
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:05,200
I wish to know the law of the land.

536
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:08,550
I was given the right to
stay till the ship arrived...

537
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,320
and now I'm being denied it.

538
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:12,550
- Is it not an insult to the law of the land?
- No!

539
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:15,990
The people here object to
the freedom you have here.

540
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:19,100
They believe the
outsiders are liars and frauds.

541
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,400
You'll have to stay under my
protection if you wish so.

542
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:25,170
- I can't agree to this condition!
- I do.

543
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:32,860
I have a heart of love.
Not a palace with wealth.

544
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:38,570
Queen, I surrender my friend to you.

545
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,560
Stop. Come here.

546
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,370
This is your reward.

547
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,040
Let it remain with you.

548
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:07,540
Queen, a friend can't
be measured in wealth.

549
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:10,180
What else could it be?

550
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:14,850
Permit me to stay in
the palace. That'll do.

551
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:17,680
What work do you know?

552
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,530
Work! Me?

553
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,340
I can laugh!

554
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:32,500
I can cry, too.

555
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:41,380
Please listen! I can
even narrate good stories.

556
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:44,300
I bring two hearts together.
The hearts!

557
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:46,340
- What else do you know?
- Me?

558
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,420
I can sing.

559
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:24,860
Let a friend stay with
another to accompany him, oh Queen.

560
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,500
It'll be better.

561
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:42,840
Leave! Leave!

562
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:50,890
- You! - Why?
- How could you reach here?

563
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:54,070
- You go away as you're in danger!
- I'm in danger?

564
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:56,646
When will you return?

565
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:59,850
I have not yet
reached my destination.

566
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:04,030
You look after
everything till I return.

567
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:05,860
That's my job.

568
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:09,126
- I die for...
- What are you babbling!

569
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,400
I'm not a girl but a boy!

570
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:15,800
This! That big! Please recognize me!

571
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:19,440
- She's known as Chhamiya.
- Chhamiya?

572
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:23,080
- What nonsense is this!
- No nonsense, my brother!

573
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:24,720
I'm a boy.

574
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,380
I like her a lot.

575
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,300
Open your eyes. Open them.
What's this disease like?

576
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,760
It's not a disease.
This love in motion can be called...

577
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:39,810
- You can name it after any sweet you like.
- Oh! So sweet!

578
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,470
She walks as if she's
going to create a storm.

579
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:45,340
- Soni.
- You have begun to stammer?

580
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:49,290
- Address me as Shibu. Shibu.
- Shibu!

581
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:52,580
Oh Shibu!

582
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,600
- Shibu.
- Shibu. - Shibu!

583
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,850
- Who's he?
- He's my brother.

584
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,410
Brother, the moon
with the name Chhamiya.

585
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:12,040
A weird moon. He's still a kid. Oh!

586
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:15,400
Listen, your
brother has begun to sigh!

587
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,750
It's the fault of the heart.

588
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:23,480
The heart loses
control on seeing you.

589
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,946
- Shibu, your brother looks okay.
- Don't call me brother!

590
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,650
You can do whatever you like...

591
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:31,330
but don't address me as a brother!

592
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:33,400
- As uncle?
- No, that sounds elderly.

593
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:35,255
As grandfather?

594
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,726
Well, we'll decide later.

595
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:42,860
- Come and hug me as it's our family's custom.
- No, brother!

596
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,530
You manage with a hand shake for now.

597
01:08:44,649 --> 01:08:46,809
- You can embrace her after marriage.
- Oh.

598
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,790
Saw that? What a boy! He
doesn't even trust a brother.

599
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,390
No problem. We can
have a handshake then.

600
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:59,040
- Your hands are really soft!
- Even your hand's nice.

601
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:00,750
You better leave now...

602
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,060
as you'll be in trouble
if someone sees you here.

603
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,800
Shibu...

604
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,389
there has to be a
celebration of my wishes today.

605
01:09:14,729 --> 01:09:16,659
Do such magic that
your friend forgets...

606
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,580
everything else and becomes mine.

607
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,040
- What happened?
- Sorry!

608
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:27,470
I broke the glass.

609
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,370
Look, let not the heart break.

610
01:09:31,189 --> 01:09:33,779
Queen, the broken heart
is even more precious.

611
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:36,640
You may go.

612
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:42,050
I have decided to win
today and I will be victorious.

613
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,090
Seclusion.

614
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,200
Why did you call me?

615
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:03,400
To pacify my heart as
I was feeling scared.

616
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:08,970
You feel scared in
spite of all this luxury.

617
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:11,810
I'm can't understand that.

618
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,310
Look into my eyes.

619
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,060
They will explain everything.

620
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:24,730
The white curtains hanging...
I don't see anything else.

621
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:27,300
Do not look at those things.

622
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:31,430
Look for the love.
That's what I wanted to show.

623
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,460
That which is
displayed is something else.

624
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:38,370
It's not love.

625
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,320
Shibu...

626
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:55,020
- Shibu, have you ever fallen in love?
- Sorry?

627
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,190
I did dream but it wasn't fulfilled.

628
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:01,890
Your dream was left unfulfilled.

629
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:04,590
Do help me realize my dream.

630
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:08,440
You did say that you
unite two broken hearts.

631
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:11,270
Fulfill your promise today.

632
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:15,070
How, Queen?

633
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:19,040
Your music has the
sound of love. Sing.

634
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:23,050
Get the flying heart to the ground.

635
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,460
I want to create a
new world of desires.

636
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:34,930
A world like that gets created
on its own. It can't be forced.

637
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,310
- I'll still try anyway.
- Try it.

638
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:42,340
Let your music express
my heart's plight today.

639
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:03,520
How do I describe...

640
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:12,430
the plight of the heart?

641
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:20,180
It's difficult

642
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,230
In the form of sheer innocence...

643
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:55,250
the killer is right in front of me

644
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:04,700
How do I describe
the plight of the heart?

645
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:18,520
Let my boat of hope
reach the shore now

646
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:49,980
Hey storm, you please hold on

647
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:58,650
The shore is right in front of me

648
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:07,460
How do I describe
the plight of the heart?

649
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:22,210
Enthusiasm asks me to move ahead...

650
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:26,060
and sense
advises me to take care

651
01:14:56,540 --> 01:15:01,040
To which should I pay heed?

652
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:09,500
The destination is
right in front of me

653
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:18,940
How do I describe
the plight of the heart?

654
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:23,570
Hey storm, you please hold on

655
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:50,460
Stop singing.

656
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,760
Stop singing this song.

657
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,670
Shibu, you may leave.

658
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:06,600
Stranger, what happened?

659
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:14,730
- There was a storm-like feeling to this song.
- No.

660
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:17,350
The music had my feelings.

661
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:20,510
The words are his
and the cry is mine.

662
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:23,020
What was that for?

663
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,580
The pain of the
heart needs medicine.

664
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:29,720
The heart's pain isn't good.

665
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:33,090
You please call the
royal doctor for that.

666
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,100
A stone!

667
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:50,750
Man, come with me.

668
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,600
Look at my eyes.

669
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:11,420
You too are a man, right?

670
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,780
My eyes can recognize men.

671
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:19,210
- How then did these eyes go wrong?
- Sorry?

672
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:21,310
- Mistake!
- Yes.

673
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:26,530
Tell me the truth.
Are the women blind?

674
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:34,170
Then what's the reason that
all my attempts are falling flat?

675
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,480
Am I not young and beautiful?

676
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,430
Too much.

677
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:45,900
Then why can't the
stranger see the love in my eyes?

678
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:51,870
Love has to go through
fire to attract someone.

679
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:57,580
Oh Queen, even a defeat
in love tastes sweet.

680
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:01,390
Get defeated if you want to win!

681
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:09,426
I have found you after many days.

682
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,300
I won't spare you that easily now.

683
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,730
- Come on.
- But listen to me.

684
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,800
My neck! It'll
break off! Free me now!

685
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:21,320
What is this?! The neck shall...

686
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,780
Heetu! Heetu!

687
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:41,950
Oh God, what have you done?

688
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:45,410
I was just joking and you've
turned into a real donkey!

689
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:48,110
Dear, who cast an evil eye on you?

690
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:52,350
Oh dear donkey,
who has done this to you?

691
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,570
Dear, why do you interfere with it?

692
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:59,020
- He's my dear Heetu.
- What are you saying?

693
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:01,766
He's my donkey. His name is Jeetu.

694
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:03,480
How dare you call him a donkey?

695
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:06,440
- He's Heetu.
- How dare you call him Heetu?

696
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:09,120
He's my donkey. He's name is Jeetu.

697
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,860
Heetu is going over there.
Look over there.

698
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:16,420
He's cheated on me again? Fraud!

699
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:18,196
I'll not spare him.

700
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:20,260
Open the door or
I'll break down the wall!

701
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,960
Come out I said!

702
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:30,190
Where are you? Where are you hiding?

703
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:35,010
- Come out in the open.
- Sister, let this remain a secret.

704
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,550
He's gone to drown
in the river for you.

705
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:41,110
He's gone to drown
in the river? Coward!

706
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:43,070
He has no shame!

707
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,230
Has he gone to drown
in the river? Heetu!

708
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:52,150
Heetu! Heetu!

709
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:14,230
I have brought the stuff and I
can't see brother Heetu today.

710
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,820
Where has he gone?

711
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,230
He's been polishing
his sword since morning.

712
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:21,650
He's just gone out in anger.

713
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,300
Sword? Anyway, never mind.

714
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:27,320
I came here to tell
you that you don't...

715
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,460
worry as the
stranger is having a ball.

716
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:30,776
He's enjoying life.

717
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,230
Since he's gone to the palace
he's forgotten everyone.

718
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:38,410
Forget it! How am I
concerned with the stranger?

719
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:43,350
I'm interested in you.
In fact I'm...

720
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:46,190
Yes go ahead.

721
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,260
- I'm attracted to you.
- Say it again.

722
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:52,070
You'll come to know
about it at the ceremony.

723
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:55,030
I, what can I do for you?

724
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:57,520
Brother isn't present in the house.

725
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,380
Come let's play a game
called Kabaddi.

726
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:05,210
My father died playing that.
Let's play some other game.

727
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:08,040
- Become a horse please.
- A horse!

728
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,480
What joke is this?

729
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:12,250
My maternal grandmother
was very fond of it.

730
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:15,490
- Please oblige. For my sake.
- No, no...

731
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:18,240
I make you swear on me.

732
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,790
Please don't make me swear! People...

733
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:26,570
I'll become one if you insist.
Here! Here I go.

734
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:36,270
Please be considerate!
The bones are breaking!

735
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:38,440
It's a test of love.

736
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,530
That's enough now! Let's...

737
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:43,470
Let's have some discussion on love.

738
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:45,940
- Oh my! Before the ceremony?
- Yes!

739
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,480
Our love is no less
than any ceremony.

740
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,740
Soni!

741
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:55,990
- What's the matter?
- Oh my!

742
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:57,390
Brother has come.

743
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,960
Let this be a secret as
it's a matter of prestige.

744
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:02,440
Please hide me somewhere! Hide me!

745
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:04,550
Okay, come along.

746
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,416
Please come soon. Hurry up.

747
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,366
- Where do I hide? Where do I hide?
- Please get inside.

748
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:12,910
- Okay, okay.
- Please get inside.

749
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:15,510
Please go.
Don't make noise I tell you!

750
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:20,450
Hodal, take up the swords.
I want to avenge the enemies.

751
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:35,560
- Please bear it as it's a time of test.
- It's very painful!

752
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:38,420
Oh my! Please bear it.

753
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:40,900
All the pain will
vanish in the ceremony.

754
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:46,640
I can't take it any longer!
I just have to give up now!

755
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:48,450
Oh my! What now!

756
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:52,140
- Please run away as brother has gone to call the neighbors.
- Okay.

757
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:55,176
Please have a glass of
juice before you leave.

758
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,600
Stop this nonsense now.

759
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:58,500
That rooster has skinned me!

760
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:07,100
Why did you hand over
a friend to an enemy?

761
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:12,370
The enemy is powerful and
only this could save his life.

762
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:15,670
What if you happen
to lose him forever?

763
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:20,430
I prefer to die
belonging to you rather...

764
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:22,020
than belonging to the Queen.

765
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:31,360
Someone's coming.

766
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:53,240
Stranger, why are
you standing outside?

767
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,340
No reason. I was just
standing and... I was...

768
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:58,660
I was just waiting for you.

769
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:00,980
- Let's go inside.
- Inside? No.

770
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:03,660
Just see! There's a
cool breeze outside.

771
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,680
- The clouds in the sky...
- I want to ask something.

772
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:17,600
- Stranger.
- Yes.

773
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:36,210
Yes, Queen.

774
01:24:39,930 --> 01:24:41,150
Your comforts.

775
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:44,740
Nobody else can give you besides me.

776
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:58,440
Wow! What a
beautiful hand! Wonderful!

777
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:01,330
I just feel like
watching it all the while.

778
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:03,720
You look very handsome nowadays.

779
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:07,346
- What happened?
- Nothing...

780
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:09,440
In fact, I can see many
more things clearly here.

781
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,400
What do you see?

782
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:15,310
All the lines in it seem
to be going towards heaven.

783
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,720
- All these lines.
- Get ready.

784
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:21,930
- Ready for what?
- We'll stroll around the river.

785
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:25,400
- We'll even share some sweet words.
- I see!

786
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,350
River, alright.

787
01:26:57,670 --> 01:26:58,870
A thief!

788
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:01,030
Open the door.

789
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:04,770
It's me! It's me!

790
01:27:08,970 --> 01:27:10,210
Your hunter.

791
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,710
- Speak up! Speak up! Why did you shout?
- Thief!

792
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:17,240
He first appeared in my eyes.

793
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,780
Then he entered my
heart through the eyes.

794
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:22,296
He's now standing
right in front of me!

795
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,070
Hey, open your eyes.
Where is he standing?

796
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:29,430
- You only are my heart's thief!
- You fool!

797
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:31,090
You always keep day dreaming!

798
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:32,790
Go! Go and sleep now!

799
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:44,770
Open the door. I asked
you to open the door.

800
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:47,700
- Wrestler, don't take the trouble. He's left.
- He's left?

801
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:50,340
It's good he's run away.

802
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:54,910
- Or else I'd have bashed him up today.
- Oh!

803
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:56,840
- You are really very brave!
- Hear that!

804
01:27:57,390 --> 01:27:59,470
You haven't witnessed my bravery.

805
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:03,090
- Once a girl got attracted to me.
- Really?

806
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,580
A wrestler began to attract her.

807
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:08,570
I didn't pay any attention
and got stomped to the ground.

808
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,330
What do I see on turning back?

809
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:14,330
The wrestler is lying on
the ground and heaving!

810
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:16,760
- What!
- Yes, heaving.

811
01:28:16,810 --> 01:28:19,460
- My heart is pounding!
- No, it isn't.

812
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:22,170
- Let me see if...
- Hey you!

813
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,580
No touching!

814
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:27,220
I'm going now. I've a headache.

815
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:29,150
Come, let me massage your head.

816
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:31,900
- Remove the turban!
- Not the turban! No!

817
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:33,830
- Not the turban!
- Why not?

818
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:37,780
- It's a woman's duty to serve the man.
- Hey you!

819
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,890
It'll be all over if
a woman happens to...

820
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:44,970
remove the turban
from a man's head.

821
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:47,090
- I'm going now.
- Stop.

822
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:49,850
Is it really bothering you?

823
01:28:49,890 --> 01:28:54,020
It was the head earlier and
now it has reached the heart.

824
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:57,290
Come to the river bank.
I'll go for a stroll.

825
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,930
River bank. Let's go.

826
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,270
Let's go.

827
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:18,590
Stay away! Stay away!
Let's get some air.

828
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:20,760
Dear, let him get some air.

829
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,650
I'm asking you to remove the
turban. You'll be relieved.

830
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:27,100
Hey! Had it been
someone else, I'd have hit him.

831
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:29,560
I'll now stab you!

832
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:35,630
Kill me, dear.
The old story will be revived.

833
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:38,320
Look over there.

834
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:42,040
Many years ago,
two lovers used to row their...

835
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:46,270
boat together in the river
and sing a song of love.

836
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:49,950
There was a third girl in
between them all of sudden.

837
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:52,210
The boat capsized.

838
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:55,150
That rock stands as
a witness to their story.

839
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:58,720
Oh! The Queen's come!

840
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:14,620
- Shibu.
- Yes...

841
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:18,640
Why are you here?

842
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:20,710
Sorry, I... I was
cleaning the stuff here.

843
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:25,086
I came to know that Your
Majesty is going to the river.

844
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:28,180
I thought that you might need me.

845
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:32,090
No. I don't need you today.

846
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:35,460
You may go.

847
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:39,240
Please take him as he
knows how to unite two souls...

848
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,090
and unite two separated people.

849
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:43,570
Queen, I can even row the boat.

850
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,590
Shibu, why all these ideas?

851
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:51,170
Me, everything for others.
Nothing for my sake.

852
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:53,460
Okay. Come and sit.

853
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:09,590
You have sat at a distance.

854
01:31:10,570 --> 01:31:14,230
What difference does it
make if the hearts are united?

855
01:31:15,610 --> 01:31:17,230
Say something even more romantic.

856
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,340
What's the need to utter anything...

857
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,890
for the one who's in love?

858
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:29,276
Two lovers lost in
each other's love used...

859
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:31,510
to sing a love
song sitting on a boat.

860
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,260
All of a sudden
another girl happened to...

861
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,240
creep in and the boat capsized.

862
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:40,430
Shibu, take care. I'm afraid we may
get swept away by the currents.

863
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:44,920
My boat will surely reach
the river bank if I sing.

864
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:56,370
My beloved will alight...

865
01:31:56,460 --> 01:32:00,570
at the shore

866
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:09,100
Oh river, flow a little more slowly

867
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:50,790
Flow slowly,
flow slowly, oh river

868
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:10,470
The naughty currents
and the flowing water

869
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,340
The ever flowing river

870
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:34,730
The boat is an old one
and the current is strong

871
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:44,160
The whirlpool does exist.
Oh river, do flow slowly.

872
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:51,060
My beloved will
alight at the shore

873
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:54,550
Oh river, flow a little more slowly

874
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:59,630
Flow slowly. Flow slowly,
oh river

875
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:19,330
The world
acknowledges your force

876
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:31,850
No one has an idea
about the sea in the heart

877
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:40,690
Either I know or it's my beloved

878
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:50,010
Oh river, flow a little more slowly

879
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:57,010
My beloved will
alight at the shore

880
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:00,490
Oh river, flow a little more slowly

881
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:05,470
Flow slowly. Flow slowly,
oh river

882
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:24,710
The boat is being
stopped by the storm

883
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:39,780
He stares silently.
He stares silently

884
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:44,680
The rower is left helpless

885
01:35:44,710 --> 01:35:47,980
The oar slips out of his hand

886
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:57,550
Oh river, flow a little more slowly

887
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,450
Flow slowly. Flow slowly,
oh river

888
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,910
Boy, you once tried to
shoot an arrow at me.

889
01:36:57,210 --> 01:36:58,930
Later, you tried to sink the boat.

890
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:01,410
Speak up! Do you still
have something to say?

891
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:04,390
- No, nothing.
- Take him away.

892
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:14,340
Such guilty ones are fit
only to be hanged.

893
01:37:15,110 --> 01:37:16,890
You'll be whipped by the stranger...

894
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,230
since you're a friend of his.

895
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:25,730
Queen, a weak man can't
face the force of the nature.

896
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,190
Please forgive him.

897
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:31,070
I could've forgiven him
if he had attacked me.

898
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:34,220
He tried to get my beloved drowned.

899
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:39,010
A clever foe is better
than a foolish friend.

900
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:43,820
Begin the punishment.
What's there to think over?

901
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:47,160
- Punish him.
- He's my friend.

902
01:37:48,690 --> 01:37:52,020
A friend can't hit another.
I seek forgiveness.

903
01:37:54,650 --> 01:37:57,170
Take him away. Behead him.

904
01:37:57,770 --> 01:38:01,950
Stop. Queen, I'll myself
punish my naive friend.

905
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:24,990
The naive one has been
punished for his folly.

906
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:28,160
Forgive him now.

907
01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:34,810
It's dangerous for you to stay here.

908
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:37,620
Get lost from the
palace immediately.

909
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:11,180
Soni...

910
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:26,890
I didn't hit you, but
the soul and heart of mine.

911
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:31,060
I'd have lost you if I didn't do so.

912
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:37,770
I can understand.
I know you didn't hit me.

913
01:39:40,630 --> 01:39:43,100
But how can I stay away from you?

914
01:39:44,850 --> 01:39:47,170
You had to go
through the pain for me.

915
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:57,776
These hands have committed a crime...

916
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,250
to love for the sake of life.

917
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,700
I can't ask you to
forgive me for this.

918
01:40:09,010 --> 01:40:10,610
You go away from here.
Somebody's coming.

919
01:40:10,710 --> 01:40:12,210
Will you meet me tomorrow?

920
01:40:13,870 --> 01:40:16,450
You wait for me at the hill when...

921
01:40:17,660 --> 01:40:19,250
the moon will be overhead.

922
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:34,080
The lightning in the form
of clouds. What's the matter?

923
01:40:35,670 --> 01:40:39,200
I'm still alive.

924
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:42,100
You did slavery all your
life but got nothing out of it.

925
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,510
The stranger did win
over the Queen's...

926
01:40:45,730 --> 01:40:47,740
heart by inflicting
you with the hunter.

927
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:52,670
You can still decide for
yourself as to who's what.

928
01:40:53,210 --> 01:41:00,470
He was with me and he
still belongs to me.

929
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,740
Be alert while guarding.

930
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:15,970
Keep awake.

931
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:20,360
This way. This direction.

932
01:41:23,570 --> 01:41:25,010
Go at the door.

933
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:34,590
The one for whom you're waiting
doesn't care for you.

934
01:41:35,490 --> 01:41:37,190
- He won't come.
- He'll come.

935
01:41:40,110 --> 01:41:41,690
The palace walls are built of stone.

936
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:46,030
- Nothing can stop love and death.
- Soni!

937
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:52,600
- You know, you'll have to lose something.
- I know.

938
01:41:54,110 --> 01:41:56,266
I'll have to lose everything.
I even know that he'll come.

939
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:58,010
You'll have to move away
when he comes.

940
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,370
It's a deal. Wait for him!

941
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:10,870
The night has come with...

942
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:18,140
a hope at its heart

943
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:26,730
I am now going with the world...

944
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:35,840
that I have lost

945
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:47,540
The stars are shining bright
and you haven't arrived

946
01:44:00,370 --> 01:44:05,040
I have called upon you

947
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:08,970
Oh beloved!

948
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:22,400
I did call upon you
and you didn't arrive

949
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:51,160
The separated souls
are weeping all the way

950
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:56,310
Oh it's like a caravan

951
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:08,940
The moon has lost its sheen
and the sky is mute

952
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:24,550
The moonlight has left,
getting upset as you haven't come

953
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:28,700
You haven't come

954
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:37,230
The stars are shining bright
and you haven't arrived

955
01:45:37,410 --> 01:45:39,960
It is shining and
you haven't come

956
01:45:55,460 --> 01:46:03,290
Only we two stars are visible now

957
01:46:11,650 --> 01:46:19,420
Please come over as
the love's calling you

958
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:35,050
Everyone's gone to sleep,
but you haven't turned up

959
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:50,630
Oh dear, please come over

960
01:46:56,410 --> 01:47:01,880
The love's calling you

961
01:47:51,770 --> 01:47:54,890
Hey! Come here! Come here!

962
01:47:59,030 --> 01:48:00,200
Go!

963
01:48:36,110 --> 01:48:37,590
Kill them! Kill them!

964
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:48,150
What are you looking at?

965
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:50,050
It's the land's
prestige at stake!

966
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:52,660
Hit them! Kill them!

967
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:01,130
Hit them! Kill them!

968
01:49:06,110 --> 01:49:08,400
Hit them! Kill them!

969
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:25,370
Stop! Please stop!

970
01:49:26,230 --> 01:49:28,500
What mistake
have these two kids committed?

971
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:32,190
- They have stained us!
- They have sinned!

972
01:49:32,810 --> 01:49:36,400
Kill them if they have sinned.
Kill them both.

973
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:40,460
But only the person
who's never committed...

974
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:43,500
a sin in life can
qualify to kill them.

975
01:49:56,870 --> 01:49:59,220
I'll take them to the Queen if you...

976
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:02,240
think they have committed a sin.

977
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:04,730
She'll pass judgement.

978
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:09,020
The priest is coming to meet you.

979
01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:12,800
Bring him in with due
respect and reverence.

980
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:03,570
The savior of the estate, oh Queen...

981
01:51:04,370 --> 01:51:07,380
people have taken
the law unto their...

982
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:12,020
own hands by
punishing a couple in love.

983
01:51:12,990 --> 01:51:17,880
I have come for justice and
the justice lies with you.

984
01:51:19,050 --> 01:51:22,190
If they are proved innocent,
let them be handed...

985
01:51:22,230 --> 01:51:27,060
over to me so that the
faith can take care of them.

986
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:30,620
It'll be so.
Let the accused be presented.

987
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:35,606
I suggest you to
announce the decision...

988
01:51:35,630 --> 01:51:37,210
without having a look at them.

989
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:39,270
Or else, you'll have trouble.

990
01:51:44,430 --> 01:51:45,910
Let them be summoned.

991
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:08,710
A cruel girl was spared of my arrow.

992
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:17,650
He's my friend and a
friend cannot beat another.

993
01:52:20,770 --> 01:52:23,920
Queen, what are you contemplating?

994
01:52:25,930 --> 01:52:30,060
Pass judgement, as they have
come to you for justice.

995
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:34,930
Respected priest, they'll
receive full justice.

996
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:36,650
When will that happen?

997
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:39,640
Today. As you are aware
that there's a certain...

998
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:42,410
procedure to deal
with such accused.

999
01:52:43,370 --> 01:52:45,010
The law of the land
shall take its course.

1000
01:52:45,710 --> 01:52:47,050
Test of fire!

1001
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:02,480
Long live the Queen!

1002
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:04,380
Long live the Queen!

1003
01:53:04,570 --> 01:53:06,160
Long live the Queen!

1004
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:08,280
Long live the Queen!

1005
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:15,710
Your Majesty,
the blaze is at its peak.

1006
01:53:16,050 --> 01:53:17,690
The flames are asking for food!

1007
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:25,100
Test of fire.

1008
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:47,260
It's not a test of fire
but a joke on humanity.

1009
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:51,010
Dear, it's the test
of your love today.

1010
01:53:51,550 --> 01:53:53,566
Prove today that the moon
can get stained but the...

1011
01:53:53,590 --> 01:53:56,810
blood of a Peshwa (king)
can never become contaminated.

1012
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:03,436
- The drug that causes inebriation?
- I've mixed it in.

1013
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:05,460
It'll cause inebriation
the moment she consumes it.

1014
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:26,320
The drink sent by the Queen.
Take it.

1015
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:29,310
May the Almighty help you.

1016
01:55:21,690 --> 01:55:22,790
No!

1017
01:55:53,230 --> 01:55:54,360
No!

1018
01:56:57,870 --> 01:56:59,440
No!

1019
01:57:26,450 --> 01:57:30,250
I'm over and done with! I'm ruined!

1020
01:57:35,510 --> 01:57:36,610
Ajab Singh!

1021
01:57:36,950 --> 01:57:39,470
- What?
- I'm devastated! Move away! - Hey...

1022
01:57:40,010 --> 01:57:41,540
- Have you gone crazy?
- Crazy!

1023
01:57:42,370 --> 01:57:43,870
Yes, I've gone mad!

1024
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:46,220
Had it not been for my madness...

1025
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:48,266
why else would I have
fallen for that con man?

1026
01:57:48,290 --> 01:57:49,530
Who deceived you?

1027
01:57:49,580 --> 01:57:52,760
The one, the girl that
went through the test of fire!

1028
01:57:53,330 --> 01:57:57,020
She came disguised as a man
and swept me off my feet.

1029
01:57:58,060 --> 01:57:59,720
She promised to marry me and went...

1030
01:58:00,030 --> 01:58:01,690
away with some other man.

1031
01:58:02,350 --> 01:58:04,010
Oh! So you want your wish...

1032
01:58:04,070 --> 01:58:05,590
to get married be fulfilled?

1033
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:07,490
But how's that possible?

1034
01:58:07,690 --> 01:58:10,300
I thought she was a boy
but she's a girl.

1035
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,570
- I shall marry you.
- You?

1036
01:58:14,290 --> 01:58:16,570
Jingo you? You?

1037
01:58:16,780 --> 01:58:19,620
- But under one condition.
- I'm ready for any.

1038
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:21,810
You'll have to
change your statement.

1039
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:23,910
You'll have to say
it was the stranger...

1040
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:25,710
and not the girl who conned you.

1041
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:28,090
I'm with you! Fine!

1042
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:30,850
What else do I need
now that you're with me?

1043
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:33,690
- I'm ready!
- Oh!

1044
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:39,830
The bird has been trapped.

1045
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:43,870
- Please sign without a second thought.
- Jingo!

1046
01:58:44,270 --> 01:58:45,970
Take advantage of the opportunity.

1047
01:58:46,710 --> 01:58:50,550
Please sign it.
The rest will be taken care of.

1048
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:56,180
I have granted the
stranger with the...

1049
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:58,880
permission to sit in the ceremony.

1050
01:59:05,290 --> 01:59:08,850
Greetings. Our boss
has complained that...

1051
01:59:09,150 --> 01:59:12,640
the stranger has molested
a girl named Shamiya.

1052
01:59:13,010 --> 01:59:15,980
The accused must be arrested.

1053
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:17,840
Signed by the Queen.

1054
01:59:18,430 --> 01:59:21,800
Priest, the stranger
has been plotted against.

1055
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:24,076
Priest, we are afraid you may get...

1056
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:26,550
stained for the
sake of the stranger.

1057
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:28,606
I believe it's better to
accept death than to...

1058
01:59:28,630 --> 01:59:30,390
lead a life
humiliating an old respected man.

1059
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,520
- Take me along.
- Priest!

1060
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:34,460
The stranger did no such thing!

1061
01:59:34,970 --> 01:59:36,410
Priest, he's innocent!

1062
01:59:37,460 --> 01:59:39,320
When the atmosphere gets heated...

1063
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:43,090
the clouds burst and
there's a cool shower.

1064
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:46,200
The stranger hasn't done any
such thing! He's innocent!

1065
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:50,240
- No! Don't hit her!
- Don't take him away!

1066
01:59:50,410 --> 01:59:51,956
Don't take him away!

1067
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:54,640
Don't take him away!
Don't take him away!

1068
01:59:55,210 --> 01:59:57,320
Don't take him away!
Don't take him away!

1069
01:59:57,540 --> 02:00:03,210
Don't take him away! He's innocent!

1070
02:00:03,630 --> 02:00:06,260
Don't take him away!
Don't take him away!

1071
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:07,660
Don't take him away!

1072
02:00:34,670 --> 02:00:42,670
The only hope that I had
latched onto is also finished

1073
02:00:53,020 --> 02:01:00,950
All because I happened
to miss your hand once

1074
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:05,720
The hope's gone

1075
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:26,670
The world couldn't
see me in happiness

1076
02:01:35,470 --> 02:01:41,550
When they couldn't
force themselves on love...

1077
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:51,760
they snatched away my beloved

1078
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:10,540
Oh my! The beloved

1079
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:18,170
The world has taken
away all my dreams

1080
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:28,120
All because I happened
to miss your hand once

1081
02:02:30,450 --> 02:02:32,700
The hope's gone

1082
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:52,720
The thirsty soul was shown
the sea but got the water now

1083
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:04,790
Oh, owner of the world...

1084
02:03:08,950 --> 02:03:14,660
Oh, owner of the world, even you...

1085
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:25,780
haven't paid any heed to me

1086
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:37,740
You didn't understand
my pain of love

1087
02:03:38,460 --> 02:03:42,870
Oh my! You didn't

1088
02:03:43,210 --> 02:03:51,210
My fate came crashing down
and the luck got crushed

1089
02:03:52,340 --> 02:04:00,340
All because I happened to
miss your hand once

1090
02:04:07,490 --> 02:04:08,920
Stranger, how are you doing?

1091
02:04:10,190 --> 02:04:11,810
I informed you
much earlier that...

1092
02:04:12,740 --> 02:04:15,460
the law of the land is
very strict for strangers.

1093
02:04:20,630 --> 02:04:23,410
The one that crushes
love and calls it a law...

1094
02:04:24,820 --> 02:04:27,690
- is not a Queen but a stain on the country.
- Shut up!

1095
02:04:32,750 --> 02:04:34,580
You have insulted my love.

1096
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:40,620
Do keep in mind that you
can't even marry anybody else.

1097
02:04:41,930 --> 02:04:44,310
I'm a woman and a Queen too.

1098
02:05:06,030 --> 02:05:08,880
Queen, please say it.
Victory or defeat?

1099
02:05:10,070 --> 02:05:11,930
- He's stubborn.
- Then?

1100
02:05:13,310 --> 02:05:14,870
He still refuses to marry me.

1101
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:17,280
Your conscience has
fallen asleep but...

1102
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:19,150
my experience is waking up.

1103
02:05:20,450 --> 02:05:24,150
- I'm still not ready to give in.
- Then?

1104
02:05:24,530 --> 02:05:26,360
The ceremony is the day after tomorrow.

1105
02:05:26,390 --> 02:05:28,671
Summon Soni and show her the
difficulties of the stranger.

1106
02:05:29,190 --> 02:05:33,590
Ask her to garland me if
she wishes to see him alive.

1107
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:35,860
What then?

1108
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:37,990
She loves the stranger.

1109
02:05:39,250 --> 02:05:40,840
She'll give in immediately when...

1110
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:43,000
she sees him in difficulty.

1111
02:05:43,150 --> 02:05:45,280
I'm ready to take up the burden...

1112
02:05:45,380 --> 02:05:48,520
to clear your way
and make you happy.

1113
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:51,090
You're a selfish
and cheap man, too.

1114
02:05:52,510 --> 02:05:55,010
Bring her but with prudence.

1115
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:58,950
I'm always at your service.

1116
02:06:02,570 --> 02:06:03,870
Come! Come in.

1117
02:06:04,170 --> 02:06:05,900
I've explained
everything to the Queen.

1118
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:08,660
Your troubles will be
over once and for all.

1119
02:06:16,070 --> 02:06:19,100
Your Majesty, I can't
see the tears in her eyes.

1120
02:06:19,580 --> 02:06:21,870
If it's for the sake
of my old loyalty then...

1121
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:25,380
I request you to be
lenient towards her.

1122
02:06:36,350 --> 02:06:39,460
Oh, the hunter has come to my door.

1123
02:06:42,950 --> 02:06:45,260
The woman has come to
me in her original form.

1124
02:06:46,370 --> 02:06:48,000
Say what you wish to say.

1125
02:06:48,700 --> 02:06:56,700
Actually, you are not
a woman but a Queen.

1126
02:06:59,690 --> 02:07:06,520
I request you, I beg of you...
the stranger is innocent!

1127
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:08,150
Please set him free.

1128
02:07:08,350 --> 02:07:11,230
Queen, please set him free!
Please free him!

1129
02:07:12,670 --> 02:07:16,800
- I'll free him but there's a condition to it.
- What!

1130
02:07:18,930 --> 02:07:20,170
What condition?

1131
02:07:22,070 --> 02:07:24,790
Promise me that you'll
garland Shangu in the...

1132
02:07:25,310 --> 02:07:30,090
ceremony if at all you
wish to save the stranger.

1133
02:07:30,660 --> 02:07:32,220
If the promise isn't fulfilled, then...

1134
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:34,540
my men will kill the stranger.

1135
02:07:36,470 --> 02:07:38,270
Queen, don't force a
promise on me to...

1136
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:40,390
live taking away my life from me!

1137
02:07:41,210 --> 02:07:43,990
Please don't do so as I
can't live without him!

1138
02:07:45,150 --> 02:07:46,920
Don't you love the stranger?

1139
02:07:48,610 --> 02:07:50,770
More than my life!

1140
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:52,630
Don't you wish him a life?

1141
02:07:54,070 --> 02:07:58,210
More than anything else!
But I wish to marry him!

1142
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:00,810
Queen, I don't wish to lose him!

1143
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:02,790
You have learned to
make others pine...

1144
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:04,430
yet not suffer yourself.

1145
02:08:04,900 --> 02:08:06,490
You told me yesterday that...

1146
02:08:06,550 --> 02:08:08,440
I should be losing
if I wished to win.

1147
02:08:08,980 --> 02:08:10,420
I'm telling you today!

1148
02:08:10,610 --> 02:08:12,420
Give him up
if you wish him to live!

1149
02:08:13,910 --> 02:08:15,630
No, no...

1150
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:17,720
Queen, please have mercy on me!

1151
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:23,540
I'll become senseless of pain!
Queen, I'll lose my senses!

1152
02:08:24,410 --> 02:08:26,710
Please show his face to me!

1153
02:08:26,770 --> 02:08:29,220
Let me see the
stranger's face please!

1154
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:32,130
You can manage to see? See.

1155
02:08:53,700 --> 02:08:55,260
The iron rods have become red hot.

1156
02:08:55,910 --> 02:08:57,500
The knives have been sharpened.

1157
02:08:58,350 --> 02:08:59,970
The verdict will be carried out...

1158
02:09:00,020 --> 02:09:01,930
if you delay any further.

1159
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:04,720
He'll first lose his eyes and then...

1160
02:09:04,790 --> 02:09:06,466
the hands will be chopped off.

1161
02:09:06,490 --> 02:09:08,080
Then his face shall be made ugly.

1162
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:09,840
He won't be able to
hold anyone's hand!

1163
02:09:09,990 --> 02:09:11,550
He won't be able to look at anyone!

1164
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:13,480
He'll never be able to love someone.

1165
02:09:15,730 --> 02:09:19,020
- Oh Goddess, what do I do?
- Don't be so heartless.

1166
02:09:19,730 --> 02:09:21,250
Transform yourself into love!

1167
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,020
Stop this injustice!
Stop this injustice!

1168
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:28,010
I'm ready to accept your condition!

1169
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:31,580
I'm ready to accept your condition!

1170
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:38,110
Hand over the accused to Soni.

1171
02:09:39,210 --> 02:09:40,776
Announce that the maid's claim...

1172
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,196
was found to be baseless.

1173
02:09:42,220 --> 02:09:45,680
Oh! I'm at your service.

1174
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:49,440
This marriage can't take place!
This marriage can't take place!

1175
02:09:49,580 --> 02:09:51,290
- It can't...
- Move away!

1176
02:09:51,710 --> 02:09:53,650
It's tyranny! It's tyranny!

1177
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:57,060
You cheat!
You remember your promise!

1178
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:58,596
I don't remember anything!

1179
02:09:58,620 --> 02:10:01,460
- Is this why I supported you?
- Stay out of it!

1180
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:04,496
I won't let those innocents suffer!

1181
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:06,120
- Do whatever you like!
- No!

1182
02:10:06,310 --> 02:10:07,766
I'll stop you at any cost!

1183
02:10:07,790 --> 02:10:09,430
Stop me if you can!

1184
02:10:11,120 --> 02:10:12,350
Move away!

1185
02:10:19,090 --> 02:10:27,090
Priest! Priest! Priest! Priest!

1186
02:10:29,170 --> 02:10:32,630
Priest! Priest!

1187
02:10:34,970 --> 02:10:36,090
Priest!

1188
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:38,100
Priest, please save Soni!

1189
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:39,756
Priest, please save Soni!

1190
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:43,400
Or else she'll be doomed!
Priest! Priest!

1191
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:46,200
Priest! Priest, please save Soni!

1192
02:10:46,540 --> 02:10:48,580
Priest, please save her or
else Soni will be ruined.

1193
02:10:49,150 --> 02:10:53,130
- Priest!
- Daughter, I couldn't get you.

1194
02:10:55,350 --> 02:10:57,306
Priest, the stranger
was falsely implicated...

1195
02:10:57,330 --> 02:10:58,810
yesterday due to my mistake.

1196
02:10:59,490 --> 02:11:05,360
Today, today the Queen has forced
Soni to garland Shango.

1197
02:11:06,090 --> 02:11:07,490
Priest, please save her!

1198
02:11:07,590 --> 02:11:10,360
Priest, please save her or else
love will get murdered! Priest...

1199
02:11:19,810 --> 02:11:27,810
Oh heart, please don't cry
as it can't change destiny

1200
02:11:58,650 --> 02:12:06,650
Is it that the wishes
come true on weeping?

1201
02:12:06,750 --> 02:12:10,690
Oh heart, don't cry

1202
02:12:20,980 --> 02:12:28,980
I've discovered the results
of falling in love with someone

1203
02:12:39,110 --> 02:12:47,010
I did see the tyranny of fate
and the action of the world

1204
02:12:57,310 --> 02:13:05,310
Love keeps sighing and
Loyalty keeps looking

1205
02:13:05,580 --> 02:13:13,330
Oh heart, please don't cry
as it can't change destiny

1206
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:30,870
Oh heart, I kept taking
your fate towards the shore

1207
02:13:40,940 --> 02:13:44,690
On the conviction in love
and the support of hope...

1208
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:52,910
I didn't have the idea that
it'd come across a storm

1209
02:13:53,170 --> 02:14:01,170
Oh heart, please don't cry
as it can't change destiny

1210
02:14:01,270 --> 02:14:05,590
Oh heart, don't cry

1211
02:14:19,270 --> 02:14:21,551
Queen, the ceremony for my
daughter will be held tomorrow.

1212
02:14:22,010 --> 02:14:24,440
I have brought a
present for the occasion.

1213
02:14:25,330 --> 02:14:27,760
Even just a blessing from you
means a lot to me.

1214
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:31,600
Let me see what else
you have got for me.

1215
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:39,020
Why do you act surprised?
Answer me.

1216
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:45,690
It was her turn today...

1217
02:14:46,760 --> 02:14:50,920
and tomorrow my daughter's love
shall be murdered.

1218
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:54,190
All this shall
happen at your behest.

1219
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:59,150
Do not attack Peshwa.
Or else the city will be ruined!

1220
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:02,920
Priest, I have no idea about it!
I have no idea about it!

1221
02:15:03,690 --> 02:15:06,370
You've forgotten about the
kingdom wearing the crown.

1222
02:15:07,110 --> 02:15:08,636
You remember the sin but you...

1223
02:15:08,660 --> 02:15:10,190
are oblivious to justice.

1224
02:15:10,770 --> 02:15:12,176
You're committing such a crime that...

1225
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:14,570
you'll never be able
to atone for it.

1226
02:15:15,350 --> 02:15:17,280
The tortured souls will curse you!

1227
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:20,290
The broken hearts will curse you!

1228
02:15:20,890 --> 02:15:22,980
You'll never be at
peace with yourself!

1229
02:15:23,700 --> 02:15:26,240
The sun will tell the
world that the Queen...

1230
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:30,660
of the kingdom Shangu,
was a cruel woman.

1231
02:15:31,210 --> 02:15:33,500
She was characterless and merciless!

1232
02:15:35,990 --> 02:15:38,960
I don't wish to hear anything.
You may go.

1233
02:15:39,430 --> 02:15:42,820
This marriage shall
take place for sure!

1234
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:50,250
Save us! Stop this devastation!
The palace has bowed!

1235
02:20:50,550 --> 02:20:53,010
- The Queen is dead!
- She's dead?

1236
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:55,540
Bring her back to life.

1237
02:20:55,900 --> 02:20:58,470
Ask her to show her power today.

1238
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:02,190
Ask her if she can stop this storm...

1239
02:21:02,260 --> 02:21:06,740
with the help of
her army and rule.

1240
02:21:07,090 --> 02:21:10,140
We don't have any hope from
her but we do have hope from you!

1241
02:21:10,390 --> 02:21:12,800
The kingdom can't
save the city today.

1242
02:21:13,010 --> 02:21:15,240
It can no longer save the city!

1243
02:21:16,340 --> 02:21:19,060
Only the Gods can stop the storm.

1244
02:21:19,980 --> 02:21:25,460
The old monk can only pray.
Come. Let us all pray.

1245
02:21:46,170 --> 02:21:51,320
Get up! Now it's time to
sacrifice as prayers won't work.

1246
02:21:52,290 --> 02:21:54,360
Who amongst you all
can sacrifice himself...

1247
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:58,450
for the sake of the country today?

1248
02:21:58,940 --> 02:22:00,710
Priest, I'll sacrifice myself.

1249
02:22:01,380 --> 02:22:02,590
Stranger, you!

1250
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:04,886
I have loved the people here and...

1251
02:22:04,910 --> 02:22:06,880
I've also seen my
love be destroyed.

1252
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:09,120
My country has taught
me that one should...

1253
02:22:09,150 --> 02:22:11,650
be ready to die for
the sake of one's country.

1254
02:22:12,220 --> 02:22:16,700
Priest! Priest!
I'm ready for the sacrifice.

1255
02:22:17,310 --> 02:22:18,570
My daughter!

1256
02:22:18,830 --> 02:22:20,920
I have the right to be
sacrificed for my land!

1257
02:22:20,970 --> 02:22:23,450
Priest, she's married and
she's someone's responsibility.

1258
02:22:23,570 --> 02:22:25,040
My body belongs to someone else.

1259
02:22:25,100 --> 02:22:27,680
- I should be allowed to die.
- Shut up!

1260
02:22:28,190 --> 02:22:31,090
Your body, your soul and
your life are in my control.

1261
02:22:31,830 --> 02:22:33,260
You have now only one duty...

1262
02:22:33,330 --> 02:22:34,740
to obey my orders!

1263
02:22:34,790 --> 02:22:38,950
- And your duty is to get the innocent stranger sacrificed?
- Soni!

1264
02:22:39,390 --> 02:22:42,920
- The stranger, for whom I garlanded you!
- Soni!

1265
02:22:42,980 --> 02:22:44,890
Shangu, you have a right to my body.

1266
02:22:45,050 --> 02:22:47,200
- My soul belongs to someone else!
- Soni!

1267
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:49,430
You are speaking to a man!

1268
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:51,960
Go and sacrifice yourself for
the country if you are a man!

1269
02:22:52,130 --> 02:22:55,270
I promise you that I'll
embrace your dead body!

1270
02:22:55,540 --> 02:22:57,210
I'll spend all my
life remembering you!

1271
02:22:57,340 --> 02:22:59,430
It's right! It's right!

1272
02:22:59,550 --> 02:23:03,640
Do as she says.

1273
02:23:03,910 --> 02:23:07,680
Sacrifice yourself.

1274
02:23:07,830 --> 02:23:14,430
Shangu is a coward!
Shangu is a coward!

1275
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:19,250
Priest, I wish to die.
Please get me sacrificed.

1276
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:21,690
Priest, would you let your
daughter die in this manner?

1277
02:23:21,860 --> 02:23:23,720
Mother Earth has summoned me today!

1278
02:23:23,860 --> 02:23:25,850
A daughter will be
sacrificed for her.

1279
02:23:26,130 --> 02:23:27,560
Not the stranger, Priest.

1280
02:23:27,630 --> 02:23:30,610
Priest, she hasn't seen life
in totality whereas I have.

1281
02:23:30,760 --> 02:23:33,510
No, Priest! The stranger has
no right to be sacrificed!

1282
02:23:33,650 --> 02:23:36,190
Priest, I'm not a stranger.
Please garland me.

1283
02:23:36,660 --> 02:23:39,210
No, Priest! I ask for my right!

1284
02:23:40,150 --> 02:23:43,620
Soni! Priest, that
can't be so! It's cruelty!

1285
02:23:44,040 --> 02:23:48,210
Priest, it's an injustice.
Soni! Soni! Priest!

1286
02:23:49,100 --> 02:23:53,470
Let me know your wish
before you die, my child.

1287
02:23:54,300 --> 02:23:57,740
Priest, I'd like to say
something to the stranger.

1288
02:23:58,590 --> 02:23:59,890
You may go.

1289
02:24:02,110 --> 02:24:03,540
What have you done?

1290
02:24:04,100 --> 02:24:05,670
You could've let me die.

1291
02:24:06,740 --> 02:24:08,640
Do you think I can
live without you?

1292
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:12,620
You... you are under my
oath if you kill yourself!

1293
02:24:14,930 --> 02:24:17,830
I'll never... I'll
never be away from you now!

1294
02:24:18,270 --> 02:24:20,350
How... how can this be possible?

1295
02:24:20,890 --> 02:24:23,960
Look... the body now
belongs to someone else!

1296
02:24:24,970 --> 02:24:27,400
It has become a barrier
between the two of us.

1297
02:24:28,300 --> 02:24:31,740
I'll do away with it
and become all yours.

1298
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:33,870
- Soni, take me along too!
- No!

1299
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:35,900
Two sacrifices aren't possible.

1300
02:24:37,130 --> 02:24:41,380
Let me go, if you
wish to be united with me.

1301
02:24:41,940 --> 02:24:43,580
Let me go! Please don't stop me.

1302
02:24:44,980 --> 02:24:47,730
Remember you once told me...

1303
02:24:48,470 --> 02:24:50,540
That there'll be a storm
the day I become a bride...

1304
02:24:50,740 --> 02:24:54,460
and I'll get lost in that.

1305
02:24:56,790 --> 02:25:01,370
How do I say now? The heart's
broken and the voice's lost.

1306
02:25:05,020 --> 02:25:07,100
Sing, stranger! I
want to keep hearing...

1307
02:25:07,180 --> 02:25:09,940
your voice at the time of my death.

1308
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:12,360
That I keep hearing your voice!

1309
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:15,890
Sing, stranger! Sing! Sing,
stranger! Sing!

1310
02:25:16,750 --> 02:25:17,920
Soni!

1311
02:25:18,190 --> 02:25:22,760
Hear my last wish. Never
attempt to kill yourself!

1312
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:25,460
Be in this very form all your life.

1313
02:25:25,990 --> 02:25:27,650
I promise you that
I'll come whenever...

1314
02:25:28,010 --> 02:25:31,800
you call me with a broken heart.

1315
02:25:32,260 --> 02:25:33,680
I'll come for sure!

1316
02:25:33,950 --> 02:25:35,130
Soni!

1317
02:25:38,980 --> 02:25:45,010
From where you have
begun to move today...

1318
02:25:46,870 --> 02:25:53,540
life's become a stranger to me

1319
02:25:54,320 --> 02:26:00,850
You have found a destination...

1320
02:26:01,870 --> 02:26:08,410
I couldn't even die

1321
02:26:16,770 --> 02:26:21,000
Oh traveler to a far off place...

1322
02:26:21,350 --> 02:26:25,410
do take me along, too

1323
02:26:25,660 --> 02:26:33,660
Do take me along, too,
as I've been left alone

1324
02:26:34,230 --> 02:26:38,330
Oh traveler to a far off place...

1325
02:26:38,580 --> 02:26:42,600
do take me along, too

1326
02:26:51,460 --> 02:26:59,460
You have given me such
pain that I've almost died

1327
02:27:02,170 --> 02:27:06,150
I'm now fed up with the world

1328
02:27:06,410 --> 02:27:10,410
You take me away from here

1329
02:27:14,970 --> 02:27:18,850
Of what use is this world...

1330
02:27:19,150 --> 02:27:23,310
that places no value on life

1331
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:31,520
Do take me along too as
I've been left alone

1332
02:27:32,060 --> 02:27:35,740
Oh traveler to a far off place...

1333
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:40,260
do take me along, too

1334
02:27:40,490 --> 02:27:48,280
Do take me along, too,
as I've been left alone

1335
02:27:57,510 --> 02:28:05,510
Love's path is lonely,
and the eyes don't speak

1336
02:28:08,040 --> 02:28:16,040
The unfulfilled wishes
are about to be buried

1337
02:28:20,810 --> 02:28:28,810
There's devastation all around

1338
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:37,200
Do take me along too as
I've been left alone

1339
02:28:37,540 --> 02:28:41,690
Oh traveler to a far off place...

1340
02:28:41,730 --> 02:28:45,710
do take me along, too

1341
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:53,090
Do take me along, too,
as I've been left alone

1342
02:28:54,130 --> 02:28:58,970
Oh traveler to a far off place...

1343
02:29:02,610 --> 02:29:06,780
do take me along, too

1344
02:29:07,020 --> 02:29:11,850
I've been left alone

1345
02:29:41,360 --> 02:29:42,590
She's come.

1346
02:30:14,240 --> 02:30:18,580
Oh traveler to a far off place...

1347
02:30:19,030 --> 02:30:23,300
do take me along, too

1348
02:30:23,590 --> 02:30:31,590
Do take me along, too,
as I've been left alone
