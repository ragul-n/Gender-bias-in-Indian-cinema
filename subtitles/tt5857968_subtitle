1
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,252
Distant voice: Ok...

2
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:55,072
So....

3
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:56,121
You deserve more?.

4
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:57,181
What?

5
00:03:57,206 --> 00:03:58,516
Hey... am I cheating on you?

6
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,772
No matter what...

7
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:03,831
You shouldn't have
left our marriage.

8
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:04,690
What?

9
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:05,587
Send it.

10
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,674
You think only your brother
knows lawyers?

11
00:04:08,868 --> 00:04:10,386
I will send you the divorce notice
before he sends it to me..

12
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:11,637
Hang up...

13
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:13,078
I said hang up...

14
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:15,722
I said hang up...

15
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:19,679
Hello...

16
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:22,207
Why are you smoking in balcony?

17
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:24,922
How can we live around?

18
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:32,464
Get in…

19
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:11,580
Mmch...What?

20
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:12,539
TV remote is not working.

21
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:13,902
This is not the one.

22
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:15,403
There must be another remote.

23
00:05:15,653 --> 00:05:17,587
Come and get it .

24
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:19,412
Ok go…I will come now.

25
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:56,221
(Ladies chatting)

26
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:57,798
Aaah...

27
00:05:57,823 --> 00:06:01,819
Hey...Can’t you see
me sitting here?

28
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:03,290
Why sitting on the pathway?

29
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:04,903
Look how rude he is.

30
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,725
Hey...

31
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,322
Heyyy..!

32
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,864
Walking with your motorbike?

33
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,240
Need any help?

34
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:32,813
Why man?.

35
00:06:32,838 --> 00:06:34,105
You go on bro..

36
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:55,548
Come this side..

37
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:57,066
Place your chin here..

38
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,334
Open your eyes wider..

39
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:07,887
Don't move....

40
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,317
Retinitis pigmentosa....

41
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:33,528
This is a rare case..

42
00:07:34,302 --> 00:07:36,301
It is known as "tunnel vision".

43
00:07:36,326 --> 00:07:38,584
It feels as if you are looking
through a pipe, right?.

44
00:07:39,518 --> 00:07:40,420
Hmm...yes....

45
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:43,029
How much can you see now?.

46
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:45,253
I can see about this much....

47
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:46,490
Can't see the Table ?.

48
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:48,630
If I look straight, only
you are visible....

49
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:51,146
Mmm...Hmm....

50
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,814
It's around 32 degrees..

51
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,876
Bit extreme for your age..

52
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:56,960
How long its been like this?.

53
00:07:56,985 --> 00:07:58,813
Since my childhood....

54
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:02,412
I always thought, this is
how everyone sees..

55
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:05,059
Didn't you check with
any other doctor?.

56
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,286
Once , I consulted a
doctor in my village..

57
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,862
he gave me some eye drops..

58
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:10,863
Thats it..

59
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:12,137
MBBS....

60
00:08:12,162 --> 00:08:14,591
not an opthalmologist?.

61
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:16,704
Didn’t you check in a
proper eye hospital?.

62
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:18,458
No....

63
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,270
Are your parents blood relatives?

64
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:23,349
Were they relatives
before marriage?.

65
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:24,765
No....

66
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,108
I've never met them..

67
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:30,492
One more report has to come..

68
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:32,345
Come back in the afternoon..

69
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:38,640
Give me a Cigarette?.

70
00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:46,179
Can't you work after
handing it to me?.

71
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,607
What is this then?.

72
00:08:47,632 --> 00:08:49,120
Kept it in front of you, right?

73
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:51,486
Didn’t notice it..

74
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:04,340
Third floor..

75
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:30,130
Hello....

76
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:32,547

Kindly check his ID, receipt hologram
before paying him the money..

88
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:07,039
Thank you sir…

89
00:10:08,677 --> 00:10:10,182
Manager : If it is a missed call

90
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:11,474
STAFF: OK Sir..

91
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,358
Ashok nagar, 3rd avenue..

92
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:36,414

93
00:10:51,103 --> 00:10:51,681
Hello..

94
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:54,188
Hello...Sir, I came for
credit card collection...

95
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:54,891
Ok....

96
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,163
But the house is locked..

97
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,746
Yes...I left already..

98
00:10:57,994 --> 00:10:59,558
But you asked us to come..

99
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,218
I asked you to come by 9.30.

100
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:06,343
You come late but you expect
me to pay on time.

101
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:08,680
What?

102
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:12,136
When will you be back?.

103
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:14,642
It will take an hour..

104
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,467
Ok sir...I will wait..

105
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:56,177
Did you go to collect money
or investigate him?.

106
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:57,959
Why didn't you return when
no one was there?.

107
00:11:58,201 --> 00:11:59,920
Looked like he was there inside.

108
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:01,412
So you called him
and said that

109
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,693
there was someone inside
his locked house?.

110
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:06,599
Why do you care where he is?

111
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:08,453
Your job is to reach customer's
place on time....

112
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,003
That's why we bought you a bike.

113
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,692
Sorry sir....

114
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:13,536
I told him about this
job only by 9 a.m..

115
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,402
why are you supporting him?.

116
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,620
Does it take half an hour
to reach Ashok nagar?.

117
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:19,143
Ravi: Sir....

118
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:19,954
Hmm....

119
00:12:19,978 --> 00:12:21,332
I need 2 hours break..

120
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:22,908
Break? For what?.

121
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,079
2 hours....

122
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,099
I will be back..

123
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:29,787
Its more complicated
then i expected..

124
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:31,990
But i have to tell..

125
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:34,050
This condition will get severe...

126
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:34,996
I mean....

127
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,074
your vision will diminish..

128
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:38,454
Will I get completely blind?

129
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:40,691
Hmmm.....

130
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:42,275
But it may take some
years for that..

131
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,768
For your stage....

132
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:45,565
eye transplant is the
only option....

133
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,319
Eye transplant?.

134
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:50,583
Is there.....

135
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:52,140
No other options..

136
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:55,655
The medicine I am giving is for
the eye irritation alone..

137
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:58,640
Get a second opinion if you need.

138
00:12:58,665 --> 00:13:01,183
The eye transplant will
cost around....

139
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:04,162
Rs. 3,20,000..

140
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:05,964
Quit alcohol....

141
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:07,122
Dont drive..

142
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:43,947
Not taking the bike home?.

143
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:46,505
No...I will go in Auto Rickshaw.

144
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,368
Excuse me....

145
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:10,326
can you please help me
cross the road?.

146
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:47,413
What sir? Is everyone
moving too fast?.

147
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:52,600
Yes..

148
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:03,631
(Ladies Chatting)..

149
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:04,789

Are you fine?.

151
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:08,546
Yes..

152
00:15:08,623 --> 00:15:09,648
Rent is due..

153
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:11,601
Date is 8th already..

154
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:13,060
I haven’t received my salary.

155
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:14,571
will pay as soon as I get it.

156
00:15:14,938 --> 00:15:16,205
Alright then..

157
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:46,862

158
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:49,252
You...Why did you....

159
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:51,174
One call and I'd have
been in your office..

160
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,455

00:16:06,988 --> 00:16:08,521
just come inside..

169
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:05,952
Hey....

170
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,445
Didn't you go in bike?.

171
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,779
I don't drive these days..

172
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:10,530
I go only in Auto Rickshaw..

173
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:12,984

180
00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:41,426
Customer drooling over the phone.

182
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:44,160

00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:59,123
who is he, madam?.

189
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:01,904
This is a landline number, sir...
everyone here has access to it..

190
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:04,051
Give me your mobile
number then…..

191
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:07,260
Ah... my number?.

192
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:08,593
Hello....

193
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:10,272
Sir, collection boy speaking.

194
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,231
Where should I come?.

195
00:18:11,378 --> 00:18:12,226
Sir...!..

196
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:15,686
Why did he hang up?.

197
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:18,511
So you thought he'll
drool over you?.

198
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:33,172
Yeah...Ravi....

199
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:34,777
Come on in....

200
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:36,069
How are your eyes?.

201
00:18:36,094 --> 00:18:37,300
What did the doctor say?.

202
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,718
Sir…give me some water, please.

203
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,090
come in....

204
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:45,586
What did they say at the hospital?

205
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:46,949
I went there..

206
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:48,909
They said eye transplantation
is the only option..

207
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:50,440
Else I might lose my
eyesight completely..

208
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:52,824
Hey.....

209
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:55,176
Nothing bad will happen..

210
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,270
Doctors say things to earn money.

211
00:18:57,295 --> 00:18:59,429
Don’t get confused..

212
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:02,121
Be good and good will come to you.

213
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:16,187
Operation will cost
Rs.3,20,000/-..

214
00:19:16,212 --> 00:19:17,613
I have no idea what to do..

215
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:19,364
(murmurs) Rs.3,20,000/-....

216
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:21,282
Just apply for a loan in
your office, right?.

217
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:25,432
Yeah... want to apply..

218
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:30,770
Sir..outstanding amount
is Rs.15200/-..

219
00:19:33,114 --> 00:19:35,262
Ok...then....

220
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:37,594
I'll pay Rs10000 now..

221
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,418
Why do you leave a balance?.

222
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:41,742
Only then you will come
next month....

223
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:44,660
you are the only person
who visits me...Mmm?.

224
00:19:45,748 --> 00:19:47,557
Did your son call you?.

225
00:19:47,628 --> 00:19:48,739
Yeah...he called me....

226
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,934
before I deposited money
in his account..

227
00:19:57,889 --> 00:19:59,139
Tell me why you
need money first?

228
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,415
Just give it to me....

229
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:01,639
Tell me why you want it...

230
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:07,084
To get drunk...right?

231
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:09,709
Showing off because
you have a job?

232
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:16,568
Don’t complain at home.

233
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,806
Tell me then,

234
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:26,506
how much did you want?

235
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:29,347
Sir...

236
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:31,139
Rs.3,20,000/-

237
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:42,053
I thought you will ask for
the pending salary...

238
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:43,931
but you are asking the entire
revenue of this company.

239
00:20:44,597 --> 00:20:45,931
You do have a good
sense of humour.

240
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:49,579
Vasanthi!

241
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:50,465
Vasanthi - Yes sir,

242
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,323
MANAGER - Get the
collection file.

243
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:52,139
Vasanthi - Coming sir.

244
00:20:57,735 --> 00:20:58,847
Why do you need so much money?

245
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:02,891
Who was that guy?

246
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:06,224
That...

247
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,357
was my elder brother.

248
00:21:08,821 --> 00:21:09,696
What does he do?

249
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,037
He was driving a Taxi before...

250
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:15,768
and now he snatches
money from me.

251
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:18,156
I'm sure he is onto
something bad.

252
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:19,264
Is your dad still working?

253
00:21:21,157 --> 00:21:22,448
He stopped working
long time back.

254
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:32,888
Meet these people before you
come to office tomorrow.

255
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,359
This is the
residential quarters…

256
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,217
you can get down here...

257
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:37,167
Isn't she there?

258
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:39,709
Who are you?

259
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:42,216
I live here...in first floor

260
00:24:43,753 --> 00:24:45,114
She is not in town.

261
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:46,139
No I saw her...

262
00:24:46,474 --> 00:24:47,599
She was here this evening.

263
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:48,222
Hello.

264
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:49,488
Mister...

265
00:24:49,513 --> 00:24:50,180
What do you want?

266
00:24:50,385 --> 00:24:51,635
I told you she is
not in town, right?

267
00:24:55,006 --> 00:24:56,506
Ok...answer the Police then.

268
00:24:57,444 --> 00:25:00,110
One minute...

269
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:01,118
Come inside.

270
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:03,472
Please...

271
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:05,264
Come inside...

272
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,256
I am Vijayprakash.

273
00:25:21,365 --> 00:25:22,240
Ravi.

274
00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:26,970
Call her…I'll leave
once I see her.

275
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,681
I know this girl already.

276
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:41,581
Just a few hours
back, she called

277
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,021
She was very disturbed
before she hung up.

278
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:52,472
So I came to check
what bothered her.

279
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,658
Why should I trust you?

280
00:27:02,013 --> 00:27:04,031
You have to believe me...

281
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,181
If I did kill her.,

282
00:27:05,948 --> 00:27:07,448
I wouldn't be talking
to you like this.

283
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:10,896
What do you want me to do now?

284
00:27:15,464 --> 00:27:16,423
You don’t have to do anything.

285
00:27:17,347 --> 00:27:18,264
Go home,

286
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,954
and I'll leave too.

287
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:24,181
There is no connection between
us and this incident.

288
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:25,246
Why should I lie?

289
00:27:25,271 --> 00:27:26,104
To get caught?

290
00:27:50,396 --> 00:27:51,729
Who is asking you to lie?

291
00:27:52,911 --> 00:27:55,078
I'm only asking you
to remain silent.

292
00:27:58,732 --> 00:28:01,149
You don't have to
do this for free.

293
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:16,245
Name is Swetha.

294
00:29:16,764 --> 00:29:18,472
She was living by herself.

295
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:21,126
She has been staying
here for 3 years

296
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,472
Door number 4

297
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,389
Door lock is unbroken and
nothing seems to be stolen.

298
00:29:28,931 --> 00:29:30,097
Did you note down ground floor?

299
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:34,156
Should I note house
owner details too?

300
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:34,764
Yes sure...

301
00:29:49,431 --> 00:29:51,306
This house is 400 meters
from the main road.

302
00:29:56,681 --> 00:29:58,331
Shall I note as west facing?

303
00:29:58,389 --> 00:29:59,097
Yeah sure.

304
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:15,387
Be careful…

305
00:30:15,412 --> 00:30:15,954
come carefully...

306
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:21,681
Open that door there...

307
00:30:24,472 --> 00:30:25,514
everyone move back...

308
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,892
all the ladies move back..

309
00:30:30,097 --> 00:30:31,097
get in carefully...

310
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:33,306
close the door now

311
00:30:44,222 --> 00:30:46,847
You mentioned that a young guy
used to visit her house...

312
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:48,931
did you tell this man about him?

313
00:30:50,532 --> 00:30:52,739
Why should I tell him that?

314
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:55,181
He is ready to pay me
for being silent...

315
00:30:55,764 --> 00:30:56,431
Why bother then?

316
00:30:57,764 --> 00:30:59,806
Didn't anyone notice you
both in that apartment?

317
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:04,114
I don’t think anyone saw us...

318
00:31:04,294 --> 00:31:05,502
Fine...

319
00:31:05,582 --> 00:31:07,166
how will you contact him?

320
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:08,597
He got my number...

321
00:31:08,764 --> 00:31:09,764
He said he'll call me soon.

322
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:20,665
Why are you being so
nice to a murderer?

323
00:31:22,335 --> 00:31:24,585
He doesn't look like a murderer.

324
00:31:24,915 --> 00:31:26,248
One thing is clear though...

325
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,720
you've decided to get
your operation done.

326
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:31,349
Not really...

327
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,097
Let the police
find out all this.

328
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:38,978
Yes absolutely...

329
00:31:39,555 --> 00:31:40,805
Most convenient excuse for you.

330
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:43,931
Are you telling me
not to get money.

331
00:31:45,188 --> 00:31:46,063
Ravi...

332
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:48,716
There is no Right or Wrong.

333
00:31:49,276 --> 00:31:50,401
You've made a dicision.

334
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,634
You want me to say
the same thing.

335
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:06,534
Needs define Morality.

336
00:32:09,424 --> 00:32:12,322
Careful... its hot.

337
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,389
Constable : How long have
you been living here?

338
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:14,681
Five years, sir…

339
00:32:15,531 --> 00:32:17,156
Were you here on
the day of murder?

340
00:32:17,181 --> 00:32:18,681
No Sir...I Had gone out

341
00:32:19,056 --> 00:32:19,847
And you madam ?

342
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:20,639
Yes sir…I was here

343
00:32:20,664 --> 00:32:22,664
Who all visited
that girl’s house?

344
00:32:22,931 --> 00:32:23,639
There were few.

345
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:24,264
Hey...

346
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:26,951
Sir...We don’t keep
checking on our neighbours.

347
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:28,639
Why did you stop her
from giving information?

348
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:31,291
We have lots of
work to attend to…

349
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:33,282
We don't want to be
involved in all this.

350
00:32:33,597 --> 00:32:35,681
How can we find the murderer
without any cooperation?

351
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:38,847
You never seem to know
what to talk…get inside.

352
00:32:44,854 --> 00:32:45,720
Lemon rice.

353
00:32:45,745 --> 00:32:46,656
I cooked it myself.

354
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:47,806
it has come out good today.

355
00:32:49,585 --> 00:32:50,181
What is this?

356
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:51,389
I am a pure non-vegetarian...

357
00:32:51,592 --> 00:32:52,752
take it back.

358
00:32:52,777 --> 00:32:53,652
Shut up and eat.

359
00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:55,524
I rarely cook this well…

360
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:00,803
Hey...

361
00:33:12,987 --> 00:33:14,446
Why haven’t you married yet?

362
00:33:22,196 --> 00:33:22,821
Hello...

363
00:33:23,091 --> 00:33:24,008
Hello, Ravi!

364
00:33:25,056 --> 00:33:25,889
Yes and you are?

365
00:33:26,717 --> 00:33:27,467

366
00:33:27,602 --> 00:33:28,435
Can we meet.?

367
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:31,932
Yes sir...

368
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:33,181

369
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:35,287

371
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:29,635
Bloody...

372
00:35:29,802 --> 00:35:30,343
Idiot...

373
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:28,543
Thanks!

374
00:36:34,635 --> 00:36:36,843
You've done a big favor for me.

375
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:55,249
How much do you want?

376
00:37:01,106 --> 00:37:04,325
Rs 3,20,000

377
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,337
Happy?

378
00:37:58,538 --> 00:37:59,288
Hello…

379
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:00,739
What happened?

380
00:38:00,927 --> 00:38:01,677
Got the money.

381
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,239
Oh…did he give you the money?

382
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:06,385
Then he is the murderer…

383
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:08,132
Who cares Sir?

384
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:10,025
How much did he give?

385
00:38:10,427 --> 00:38:11,718
He asked me.

386
00:38:12,343 --> 00:38:14,343
You'd have asked what's
needed for the operation.

387
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,209
Sir, how did you guess?

388
00:38:17,885 --> 00:38:19,385
There was no answer
when I called you...

389
00:38:19,802 --> 00:38:21,927
So I thought he might
have killed you too.

390
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:30,369
Mam…

391
00:38:31,606 --> 00:38:33,439
You press clothes for this
entire neighbourhood?

392
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,177
Yes sir…

393
00:38:34,718 --> 00:38:36,968
and for that murdered girl?

394
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:38,989
She never used to
give me clothes, sir…

395
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:40,944
Don’t lie, madam…

396
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:42,302
Why should I lie sir?

397
00:38:56,829 --> 00:38:57,704
Mr. Ravichandran…

398
00:38:58,493 --> 00:38:59,451
Please come.

399
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,552
Operation amount is Rs 4,82,000

400
00:39:10,635 --> 00:39:11,260
How much?

401
00:39:11,968 --> 00:39:13,427
Rs 4,82,000

402
00:39:14,427 --> 00:39:16,218
But the Doctor said Rs.3,20,000

403
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,231
Surgeon fees is Rs.3,22,000 sir.

404
00:39:21,515 --> 00:39:23,765
Anaesthesia fee,
pharmacy, bed charges,

405
00:39:24,036 --> 00:39:26,370
and you've to stay
in ICU for a day.

406
00:39:26,395 --> 00:39:28,728
all this adds upto Rs
4,82,000 seems to be correct.

407
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:31,736
Can I meet the doctor?

408
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,881
Not right now sir.

409
00:39:37,302 --> 00:39:39,510
Operation cannot be done
without anaesthesia…

410
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:41,045
they are usual charges only...

411
00:39:41,093 --> 00:39:42,468
Come back after arranging
the full amount.

412
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:47,760
Mrs. Thanikachalam…

413
00:40:00,384 --> 00:40:01,009
Hello...

414
00:40:01,677 --> 00:40:02,927
Hello Sir, this
is Ravi speaking…

415
00:40:03,552 --> 00:40:04,343
Which Ravi?

416
00:40:08,843 --> 00:40:11,302
We met a couple of days back.

417
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,825
Yeah…tell me.

418
00:40:16,066 --> 00:40:18,357
Sir, I need some extra money.

419
00:40:18,428 --> 00:40:19,345
Ravi…ravi…

420
00:40:20,468 --> 00:40:21,927
you helped me and in return...

421
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:24,132
I paid the amount you asked…

422
00:40:24,385 --> 00:40:25,760
there is nothing
left to discuss.

423
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:28,989
Ok Sir.

424
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:20,968
Did you get drenched in rain?

425
00:41:24,622 --> 00:41:25,788
She was a nice girl…

426
00:41:26,406 --> 00:41:28,101
didn’t even get her
clothes back from me.

427
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:30,345
She died that night itself…

428
00:41:31,124 --> 00:41:32,708
Heard that there was blood
all over the house…

429
00:41:33,135 --> 00:41:34,885
the stench had permeated
the whole area.

430
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,718
No one came to receive
the body it seems.

431
00:41:39,725 --> 00:41:41,309
You knew her right?

432
00:41:48,538 --> 00:41:49,622
Actually…

433
00:41:49,986 --> 00:41:52,236
I saw you near that
house that night.

434
00:42:00,427 --> 00:42:02,052
You must've seen somebody else.

435
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:39,811
Open it completely.

436
00:45:43,223 --> 00:45:44,711
Can I come with my shoes on?

437
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:46,702
RAVI : Thats ok.

438
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,108
Where do you work?

439
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:02,843
Credit card collection firm.

440
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:18,860
What’s your name?

441
00:46:18,885 --> 00:46:19,385
Ravi

442
00:46:21,744 --> 00:46:22,702
Are you a bachelor?

443
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,563
Hmmm . . .

444
00:46:26,204 --> 00:46:27,829
Have you seen that girl before?

445
00:46:28,772 --> 00:46:30,397
I've seen her…but
never got acquainted.

446
00:46:30,635 --> 00:46:31,442
Another police : Sir…

447
00:46:32,635 --> 00:46:33,677
house on top floor is locked.

448
00:46:34,278 --> 00:46:35,986
Check again. They might lock
the door and hide inside.

449
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:37,843
I did sir. No one's there.

450
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:39,926
Move on to the next block then.

451
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:46,044
Constable : Which
bank do you work for?

452
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:47,802
It’s not a bank sir...

453
00:46:47,981 --> 00:46:49,189
Credit card collection firm.

454
00:46:50,061 --> 00:46:52,145
On the day of murder, did you
notice anything abnormal ?

455
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:55,001
Like someone screaming or
loitering around the house?

456
00:46:55,741 --> 00:46:56,658
Mmm hmm

457
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:01,686
Usually, what time you
come home from work?

458
00:47:02,335 --> 00:47:04,252
No fixed time...I can
come anytime I want.

459
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:05,272
Ohh...

460
00:47:05,968 --> 00:47:07,010
What a work!!

461
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,927
You can come and go anytime.

462
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:10,677
Its delightful to hear.

463
00:47:11,764 --> 00:47:12,848
Not like that, sir.

464
00:47:12,927 --> 00:47:14,468
timings depend on
the collections.

465
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:25,818
(on phone) Tell me…

466
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,052
have you reached the station?

467
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:29,802
Fine...

468
00:47:30,825 --> 00:47:32,241
Write a complaint and
give it to the constable.

469
00:47:37,718 --> 00:47:39,260
Hey - write the complaint
as if he hit you.

470
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:44,739
Constable : I am on the
way to the station…

471
00:47:48,923 --> 00:47:50,090
Ravi : Sir?

472
00:47:54,356 --> 00:47:56,856
There was a Person in
her house that day.

473
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:01,452
Hang up…I'll call you back.

474
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:28,249
Sir...

475
00:48:28,695 --> 00:48:30,779
He is the witness in
that girl’s murder case.

476
00:48:35,076 --> 00:48:35,992
Come inside.

477
00:48:51,149 --> 00:48:52,108
Is this the guy you saw?

478
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:10,191
Yes sir.

479
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:11,274
Are you sure?

480
00:49:11,732 --> 00:49:12,898
I'm sure he is the one.

481
00:49:14,936 --> 00:49:15,769
Ok come.

482
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,624
His name is Arun right?

483
00:49:22,649 --> 00:49:23,206
Yes sir.

484
00:49:23,231 --> 00:49:24,398
What did he say
in his statement?

485
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:25,796
Sir…

486
00:49:25,821 --> 00:49:26,488
Lady Police: Good morning sir.

487
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:28,171
He has never seen
that girl it seems…

488
00:49:28,784 --> 00:49:30,409
and he has never been
to that area at all.

489
00:49:30,566 --> 00:49:31,358
Who is standing next to him?

490
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:32,518
His advocate.

491
00:49:33,188 --> 00:49:34,438
They claim they don’t
know anything,

492
00:49:34,774 --> 00:49:36,191
but they bring an
advocate along.

493
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:38,808
(sheepishly) you are right sir…

494
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:43,264
What was the message sent to
this guy from the girl’s phone ?

495
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:45,061
“This is my new number - Swetha”

496
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:47,164
What does he have
to say about it?

497
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:50,149
He claims he didnt reply as it
came from an unknown number.

498
00:49:50,649 --> 00:49:53,108
And the girl bought this SIM
card on the day of murder.

499
00:49:53,608 --> 00:49:55,691
this was the only message
sent from that SIM.

500
00:49:59,058 --> 00:50:00,629
What's your name?

501
00:50:01,722 --> 00:50:02,639
Ravi…

502
00:50:03,149 --> 00:50:04,358
Have you seen this guy
in that place before?

503
00:50:05,246 --> 00:50:06,316
I have seen him a
couple of times…

504
00:50:07,691 --> 00:50:08,649
How were they… together?

505
00:50:09,524 --> 00:50:11,208
They did seem a little intimate…

506
00:50:11,233 --> 00:50:13,399
LITTLE intimate? ….
what does that mean?

507
00:50:14,476 --> 00:50:15,143
Fine...

508
00:50:15,233 --> 00:50:16,608
Give your statement and leave.

509
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,139
Come when we call you…

510
00:50:18,463 --> 00:50:19,338
Ok sir. Thank you

511
00:50:20,347 --> 00:50:22,097
What did other residents
in that apartment say?

512
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:23,901
The girl was not
friendly types...

513
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:26,999
2 or 3 people used to visit
her house regularly…

514
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:30,566
no one seems to know
anything beyond that.

515
00:50:30,936 --> 00:50:31,769
Then?

516
00:50:31,794 --> 00:50:33,341
Even if lightning
strikes next door,

517
00:50:33,785 --> 00:50:35,618
City people would say they
were busy watching TV shows.

518
00:50:39,281 --> 00:50:41,615
They used to fight with each
other often...Should I?

519
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,432
Write everything you saw there.

520
00:51:02,649 --> 00:51:05,733
(Phone Voice) the number you have
called is currently switched off

521
00:51:16,321 --> 00:51:17,113
Anu…

522
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:20,499
I need a phone number.

523
00:51:20,524 --> 00:51:22,149
Vijay Prakash. Age would
be around 45 years.

524
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:24,941
can you search with Company
or Agency details?

525
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:10,069
Sir, Help us sir! Please sir...

526
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:12,230
Help us sir! Please sir...

527
00:52:19,233 --> 00:52:20,649
Sorry! I dont have any coins…

528
00:52:41,397 --> 00:52:42,813
Sir What are doing here?

529
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:45,998
Waiting for a friend...

530
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:47,998
please move

531
00:52:57,151 --> 00:52:57,943
Hello sir...

532
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:06,149
One minute, please.

533
00:53:17,566 --> 00:53:18,441
I am Balan.

534
00:53:29,937 --> 00:53:34,140
You identified 'Arun’ in the
girl’s murder case right?

535
00:53:34,367 --> 00:53:35,284
Yes

536
00:53:36,203 --> 00:53:37,328
Can we sit inside and talk?

537
00:53:39,826 --> 00:53:40,659
Please come..

538
00:53:49,441 --> 00:53:54,316
Parents these days only want
to make money for their kids..

539
00:53:55,108 --> 00:53:57,215
They are not concerned
about anything else..

540
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,074
Consider this case,

541
00:53:58,691 --> 00:54:00,308
he is the only son and

542
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:01,124
very pampered too..

543
00:54:01,858 --> 00:54:03,316
He is accused of murder
at the age of 27.

544
00:54:05,316 --> 00:54:07,233
Were you interested
on that girl.

545
00:54:07,649 --> 00:54:08,358
huh?

546
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:11,477
And you are?

547
00:54:14,445 --> 00:54:16,737
I am Arun’s advocate’s junior..

548
00:54:17,441 --> 00:54:18,191
like a junior...

549
00:54:18,246 --> 00:54:19,246
however you want to call it.

550
00:54:20,776 --> 00:54:22,234
I have seen that
girl few times...

551
00:54:22,711 --> 00:54:23,836
but I don’t really know her.

552
00:54:24,037 --> 00:54:24,953
Why do you ask?

553
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:31,274
Arun never told me
the truth entirely.

554
00:54:31,524 --> 00:54:33,899
I would have advised him to
give the statement accordingly.

555
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:39,889
What truth?

556
00:54:42,141 --> 00:54:42,850
Sir

557
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:46,492
you are the only eye
witness against Arun..

558
00:54:47,399 --> 00:54:48,733
You don’t have to lie,

559
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,231
when asked in court, just say...

560
00:54:51,256 --> 00:54:54,465
you're not sure if it was him
or you saw him from a distance.

561
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:55,781
Say something like that..

562
00:54:59,149 --> 00:55:00,399
Give me your advocate's number…

563
00:55:01,149 --> 00:55:02,046
Let me call him ...

564
00:55:02,071 --> 00:55:03,030
I will talk to him myself...

565
00:55:03,055 --> 00:55:04,097
No, no, let me call
him right now..

566
00:55:08,683 --> 00:55:09,350
Sir

567
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:10,333
Advocate : Tell me Balan.

568
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:11,858
He wants to talk to you sir..

569
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:13,102
Advocate : Ok

570
00:55:17,274 --> 00:55:17,858
Hello..

571
00:55:17,883 --> 00:55:19,175
Advocate : Tell me Mr.
Ravichandran…

572
00:55:22,983 --> 00:55:23,899
Hello!

573
00:55:24,566 --> 00:55:25,691
How can I trust you?

574
00:55:26,024 --> 00:55:27,899
Your junior is not even
giving me your phone number..

575
00:55:28,316 --> 00:55:29,858
Advoate : Listen to me Ravi..

576
00:55:30,531 --> 00:55:32,031
You don’t know
about the police..

577
00:55:32,316 --> 00:55:33,858
When everybody is
being silent...

578
00:55:33,989 --> 00:55:35,614
if you give a testimony,

579
00:55:35,928 --> 00:55:37,594
you will be their
first suspect..

580
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:38,691
Me as well ?

581
00:55:38,691 --> 00:55:39,566
Yes...

582
00:55:39,566 --> 00:55:41,316
that's why I avoid talking
to you directly..

583
00:55:42,108 --> 00:55:42,858
Fine...

584
00:55:42,983 --> 00:55:43,899
how much money can you give?

585
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:46,316
Advocate : Money
is not a concern..

586
00:55:46,496 --> 00:55:47,371
stay on our side.

587
00:55:47,441 --> 00:55:49,386
Tell me an amount...

588
00:55:49,724 --> 00:55:52,003
Advocate : Pass the
phone to Balan.

589
00:55:54,357 --> 00:55:55,963
Is he still on the line…

590
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,781
Advocate : Balan, quote him
the amount we discussed..

591
00:55:59,806 --> 00:56:00,640
Ok sir..

592
00:56:00,665 --> 00:56:02,040
ADVOCATE : Lets discuss later.

593
00:56:02,065 --> 00:56:02,982
Ok sir..

594
00:56:08,066 --> 00:56:08,691
Sir

595
00:56:09,422 --> 00:56:13,464
You cannot expect much for
a trivial eyewitness.

596
00:56:14,649 --> 00:56:15,774
But for you...

597
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:19,024
I can negotiate upto
Rs.50,000…Yeah?

598
00:56:25,774 --> 00:56:27,291
Hold on one minute…

599
00:56:27,479 --> 00:56:28,229
Sir

600
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:30,948
Sir

601
00:56:36,441 --> 00:56:38,149
Tell me how much you expect?

602
00:56:51,038 --> 00:56:53,163
You left without
saying anything?

603
00:56:53,188 --> 00:56:55,896
RAVI : The way he addressed
me was irritating...

604
00:56:55,921 --> 00:56:57,331
and he kept asking
how much I wanted.

605
00:56:57,356 --> 00:56:59,065
You should have asked…

606
00:56:59,589 --> 00:57:01,631
under this circumstances,
they will pay anything.

607
00:57:02,045 --> 00:57:03,045
It’s ok...eat.

608
00:57:03,524 --> 00:57:06,316
How did they find
out where you live?

609
00:57:06,858 --> 00:57:07,774
Dont know,

610
00:57:07,828 --> 00:57:09,745
Police sweared that
even my name wont leak.

611
00:57:10,453 --> 00:57:11,662
They'll say anything...

612
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:14,916
since there's no one to
argue from the girl’s side,

613
00:57:14,941 --> 00:57:18,066
they'd cite random reasons
to close out the case.

614
00:57:20,274 --> 00:57:23,608
Didn't the police find out
about your condition?

615
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:24,983
Why?

616
00:57:25,816 --> 00:57:27,233
You stumble even in
broad daylight...

617
00:57:27,566 --> 00:57:29,066
I don’t stumble in
front of others…

618
00:57:29,483 --> 00:57:31,274
I'll look at it like this
and...pick it up like this.

619
00:57:32,378 --> 00:57:33,670
I thought you were naive...

620
00:57:34,241 --> 00:57:35,866
but you really are smart.

621
00:57:37,274 --> 00:57:38,941
Someone has fled after
committing the murder...

622
00:57:40,733 --> 00:57:42,566
and you used that loophole
to fulfils your needs..

623
00:57:45,427 --> 00:57:47,135
Poor girl. She is the
one who suffered.

624
00:57:51,377 --> 00:57:52,419
Do you want one more Dosa?

625
00:57:52,444 --> 00:57:53,360
No, I’m good..

626
00:57:56,733 --> 00:57:59,108
Sir, the witness Ravi
has come to meet you..

627
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,308
What for?

628
00:58:00,399 --> 00:58:01,399
He wants to talk to
you about something..

629
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:03,066
I thought tomorrow...(thinks)

630
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:05,024
Ok ask him to come

631
00:58:05,535 --> 00:58:06,666
He is alone right?

632
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:07,649
Yes sir.

633
00:58:07,774 --> 00:58:08,524
Fine.

634
00:58:11,277 --> 00:58:12,819
I feel like I've made a mistake.

635
00:58:15,524 --> 00:58:17,413
I'm scared sir.

636
00:58:17,438 --> 00:58:19,640
There wont be any
problem, right?

637
00:58:19,665 --> 00:58:21,915
Why? Did someone contact you?

638
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:25,691
No..

639
00:58:27,441 --> 00:58:28,899
I heard you suspect people

640
00:58:28,899 --> 00:58:30,399
who voluntarily
provide testimony…

641
00:58:31,326 --> 00:58:32,984
Who told you this?

642
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:34,483
Don’t get confused
unnecessarily Ravi…

643
00:58:35,066 --> 00:58:37,691
Even their sexual affair will be
proved in the Postmortem report.

644
00:58:38,046 --> 00:58:39,565
Just be strong and
sure in the court..

645
00:58:39,691 --> 00:58:41,608
I will ensure you dont face
any issues...understood?

646
00:58:55,974 --> 00:58:56,891
Hello, Detective..

647
00:58:56,916 --> 00:58:57,874
RAVI : Hello..

648
00:58:57,899 --> 00:58:58,816
Are you busy?

649
00:58:59,566 --> 00:59:00,858
Was in the middle
of something,..why?

650
00:59:01,234 --> 00:59:04,068
13 numbers matched up with
the name you gave me…

651
00:59:04,733 --> 00:59:05,566
ANU : note it down.

652
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:10,284
Yes, tell me…

653
00:59:13,407 --> 00:59:14,449
15…

654
00:59:27,412 --> 00:59:28,120
Hello…

655
00:59:30,774 --> 00:59:31,514
Is Vijayprakash there?

656
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:32,164
What?

657
00:59:33,066 --> 00:59:34,499
Vijayprakash?

658
00:59:34,524 --> 00:59:35,899
Who are you, who you want?

659
00:59:43,094 --> 00:59:44,219
Vijayprakash?

660
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:49,892
Vijayprakash?

661
00:59:49,917 --> 00:59:51,334
Sorry, wrong number

662
00:59:52,441 --> 00:59:53,233
Vijayprakash?

663
00:59:56,141 --> 00:59:57,058
wrong number

664
01:00:01,649 --> 01:00:02,441
Vijayprakash?

665
01:00:22,292 --> 01:00:23,083
Hello...

666
01:00:23,108 --> 01:00:24,137
Lady on phone : Prakash
group of industries….

667
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,329
Is Vijayprakash there?

668
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:26,834
Lady on phone : And you are….

669
01:00:27,781 --> 01:00:28,865
I am Ravichandran speaking…

670
01:00:41,717 --> 01:00:42,967
I am Ravi speaking…

671
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:47,417
Ravichandran...

672
01:00:51,329 --> 01:00:53,162
Inspector : (to constable) She had
been working here for 2 years…

673
01:00:54,371 --> 01:00:56,079
She was his direct secretary…

674
01:00:57,246 --> 01:00:59,746
He was paying her
Rs.18,000/- as salary..

675
01:00:59,871 --> 01:01:00,454
ok sir.

676
01:01:01,246 --> 01:01:02,287
Then...

677
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:08,371
Where would you both go
for tours regularly?

678
01:01:12,746 --> 01:01:14,037
Those were not tours…

679
01:01:14,258 --> 01:01:15,341
It’s an official trip…

680
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:18,500
Sometimes Singapore and…

681
01:01:21,287 --> 01:01:22,912
How long would these
tours generally be?

682
01:01:24,746 --> 01:01:26,718
2 days…

683
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:31,871
Sometimes 4 days...

684
01:01:35,816 --> 01:01:38,274
Has that girl ever spoken to
you about her personal life?

685
01:01:40,133 --> 01:01:42,633
We don’t talk about such things

686
01:01:43,037 --> 01:01:45,496
But she has called you
almost everyday...

687
01:01:45,871 --> 01:01:47,054
Sir...

688
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:48,579
She is my personal secretary...

689
01:01:49,496 --> 01:01:50,537
At times we have to talk...

690
01:01:56,954 --> 01:01:57,746
Go ahead.

691
01:01:59,912 --> 01:02:02,144
2 mins...Please.

692
01:02:10,746 --> 01:02:13,887
She has made out calls to
another phone number right?

693
01:02:13,954 --> 01:02:15,179
whose name is it in?

694
01:02:15,204 --> 01:02:16,662
The girl's name itself sir...

695
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:17,880
Really?

696
01:02:19,037 --> 01:02:20,221
INSPECTOR : Did you try
calling that number?

697
01:02:20,246 --> 01:02:22,079
CONSTABLE : It's
always switched off,

698
01:02:24,263 --> 01:02:26,346
INSPECTOR : Did his fingerprint
match with any from the house?

699
01:02:26,433 --> 01:02:27,996
CONSTABLE : There were
no other fingerprints in

700
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:29,582
that place apart from
that girl's and Arun's...

701
01:02:32,097 --> 01:02:38,597
He is saying that she is personal and
secretary and he is confusing us.

702
01:03:01,996 --> 01:03:03,704
INSPECTOR : How many years did
you say she worked for you?

703
01:03:06,246 --> 01:03:07,621
2 years..

704
01:03:13,871 --> 01:03:15,121
Ok, sir...thank you...

705
01:03:34,746 --> 01:03:36,811
Who told you to
identify that guy?

706
01:03:39,321 --> 01:03:42,529
Actually I went to the police
station to snitch against you...

707
01:03:44,118 --> 01:03:45,082
but I change my mind as

708
01:03:45,107 --> 01:03:46,649
I could still smell your
money in my hands...

709
01:03:49,915 --> 01:03:52,471
Why did you say you knew him?

710
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:57,451
RAVI : not to speak
against that guy right?

711
01:04:01,792 --> 01:04:03,583
If I get him caught...

712
01:04:03,808 --> 01:04:05,267
you will be the most benefitted.

713
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:08,596
you will be the most benefitted.

714
01:04:08,621 --> 01:04:10,871
He doesn’t look like
he is a murderer.

715
01:04:13,044 --> 01:04:16,086
I just meant he
looks innocent...

716
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:19,679
RAVI : He is a big shot too...

717
01:04:19,704 --> 01:04:21,329
People from his side
came to meet me.

718
01:04:22,121 --> 01:04:22,996
Heard he was the only son...

719
01:04:24,407 --> 01:04:27,699
Poor guy, he shouldn't have
been involved with the girl.

720
01:04:28,371 --> 01:04:30,387
How much did they give?

721
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:31,829
They are ready to
give me any amount...

722
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:33,621
But I refused...

723
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:39,246
I wanted to meet you before
I decide on anything..

724
01:04:42,136 --> 01:04:44,177
I wanted to give you Rs.
5,00,000 the other day.

725
01:05:09,834 --> 01:05:11,554
This is the receipt
for what you paid...

726
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:13,269
Your Serial number is...

727
01:05:13,496 --> 01:05:14,954
Will call you once we
get an eye donor...

728
01:05:15,204 --> 01:05:16,912
And you'll have to come
within 3 hours' notice...

729
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,162
I presume you've been
told all this earlier.

730
01:05:20,204 --> 01:05:21,743
What is that 331?

731
01:05:21,787 --> 01:05:22,868
Your Serial number, sir...

732
01:05:22,893 --> 01:05:24,893
You are the 331st person
in the waiting list

733
01:05:25,996 --> 01:05:28,829
So, will I get it only
after 330 people ?

734
01:05:29,357 --> 01:05:30,274
Yes sir...

735
01:05:31,746 --> 01:05:32,496
So, when will I get that?

736
01:05:33,552 --> 01:05:36,969
I cannot say for sure... It
largely depends on the donor..

737
01:05:37,329 --> 01:05:38,912
It can be 2 years...

738
01:05:39,115 --> 01:05:41,740
and there are even people
waiting for 6 years...

739
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,037
Are you trying to trick me?

740
01:05:43,329 --> 01:05:44,579
You keep saying different
things when I come here.

741
01:05:45,162 --> 01:05:45,704
1 minute...

742
01:05:45,746 --> 01:05:46,454
what happened?

743
01:05:46,496 --> 01:05:48,204
He got angry once I
told him the procedure.

744
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,589
Sir,

745
01:05:49,765 --> 01:05:51,054
We don’t decide it...

746
01:05:51,227 --> 01:05:52,727
Blindness division decide it...

747
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:55,329
Did I pay today to
wait for 6 years?

748
01:05:55,621 --> 01:05:56,596
One minute..

749
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:57,496
Don’t get angry,sir…

750
01:05:57,496 --> 01:05:58,496
Speak here.

751
01:05:58,496 --> 01:05:59,162
Please come over here...

752
01:05:59,996 --> 01:06:00,554
Take your hands off..

753
01:06:00,579 --> 01:06:01,121
Come along, sir..

754
01:06:01,704 --> 01:06:02,246
Take your hands off..

755
01:06:02,412 --> 01:06:02,787
Sorry...

756
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:04,621
Come along, sir..

757
01:06:05,746 --> 01:06:07,898
Why are you shouting sir?

758
01:06:09,442 --> 01:06:11,374
Please come over here...

759
01:06:11,871 --> 01:06:14,871
not just here this is the
procedure everywhere...

760
01:06:15,746 --> 01:06:20,371
Hospitals take money in advcane
so there's no trouble later

761
01:06:20,621 --> 01:06:22,121
You mentioned 2 or 6
years delay only now?

762
01:06:22,183 --> 01:06:23,099
Can't you inform beforehand?

763
01:06:26,996 --> 01:06:28,496
Sir... there is a way
out of all this....

764
01:06:29,037 --> 01:06:30,496
If you spend some
money, your name

765
01:06:30,496 --> 01:06:31,954
can be included within
the first 10 numbers....

766
01:06:46,099 --> 01:06:46,787
How much?

767
01:06:47,162 --> 01:06:47,829
Rs. 5,00,000/-

768
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:49,287
Must paid before operation.

769
01:06:50,246 --> 01:06:50,996
fixed rate..

770
01:06:51,537 --> 01:06:53,246
Arrange the money and I
guarantee your operation...

771
01:07:09,371 --> 01:07:10,121
Watch where you are going..

772
01:07:10,146 --> 01:07:10,854
Sorry brother…

773
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:21,829
Excuse me...

774
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:25,287
My sister’s daughter who is
living in nearby town...

775
01:07:25,996 --> 01:07:28,579
Her husband has a got
a job in our area…

776
01:07:29,493 --> 01:07:31,118
She is looking for
a house right now…

777
01:07:31,246 --> 01:07:34,537
It wouldn’t be nice if she has
to look for a house elsewhere...

778
01:07:35,037 --> 01:07:36,621
Please vacate the house soon.

779
01:07:45,652 --> 01:07:47,902
Your total time here
is 7 years 3 months,

780
01:07:47,927 --> 01:07:50,511
so your Provident Fund
total will be Rs.32,000.

781
01:07:52,204 --> 01:07:54,798
Are you going to quit?

782
01:08:03,425 --> 01:08:05,550
BOSS : Whats your problem now?
Why do you want to quit?

783
01:08:06,857 --> 01:08:08,024
I am unable to work sir..

784
01:08:08,305 --> 01:08:09,694
I am not keeping well..

785
01:08:09,746 --> 01:08:10,454
Take some time off then...

786
01:08:10,987 --> 01:08:12,487
We're giving you less
customers to attend to right?

787
01:08:16,609 --> 01:08:18,746
Are you quitting because I
did not sanction your loan?

788
01:08:18,787 --> 01:08:19,787
Nothing like that sir

789
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:21,996
Okay then…

790
01:08:26,687 --> 01:08:27,555
you can go…

791
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:36,115
You also can leave …

792
01:09:22,454 --> 01:09:25,392
Ravi..come here.

793
01:09:28,977 --> 01:09:30,929
Ravi : Greetings sir...

794
01:09:30,954 --> 01:09:32,454
Ravi, are you coming
back from work?

795
01:09:33,064 --> 01:09:33,621
Yes, sir

796
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:35,037
Do you normally get
back around this time?

797
01:09:35,787 --> 01:09:37,287
No Sir...I came back
earlier than usual.

798
01:09:38,954 --> 01:09:40,662
Can you write down your address
and phone number here?

799
01:09:41,579 --> 01:09:43,287
Sir, I had already
given it to you

800
01:09:43,607 --> 01:09:46,216
It wasn't clear....Write
it again.

801
01:09:47,691 --> 01:09:48,982
Give him a pen…

802
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:09,037
Here…sir...

803
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:17,184
What's the problem
with your eyes?

804
01:10:19,454 --> 01:10:20,704
What are you getting
treated for?

805
01:10:22,996 --> 01:10:24,037
I'm talking to you...

806
01:10:28,302 --> 01:10:30,136
I can only see things that
are in front of me...

807
01:10:31,243 --> 01:10:32,618
Things in the sides
are not visible.

808
01:10:32,954 --> 01:10:34,662
but there is no problem
with my vision.

809
01:10:35,621 --> 01:10:38,579
And whatever i said that
I saw are all true.

810
01:10:43,974 --> 01:10:45,641
Make sure Arun’s people
dont find out about this..

811
01:10:46,329 --> 01:10:48,179
They'll hold onto this
as an argument in court…

812
01:10:48,204 --> 01:10:50,287
Lack of evidence is a big
headache in this case already…

813
01:10:52,204 --> 01:10:53,496
And dont attend
treatment for a while.

814
01:12:22,412 --> 01:12:23,429
Hello..

815
01:12:23,454 --> 01:12:24,454
This is Ravichandran speaking.

816
01:12:29,501 --> 01:12:30,251
Balan : Here..

817
01:12:40,371 --> 01:12:42,846
What ever you did
is correct sir.

818
01:12:42,871 --> 01:12:44,385
If you had not behaved
like that earlier,

819
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:45,577
they would not have
agreed to this amount..

820
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:49,246
Even when you were
talking on the phone..

821
01:12:49,246 --> 01:12:51,037
I thought you were
being very stubborn.

822
01:12:51,621 --> 01:12:54,090
but fantastic move sir..

823
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:55,496
We should be the ones
fixing our rates.

824
01:12:59,094 --> 01:13:00,052
BALAN : Watch the floor..

825
01:13:02,746 --> 01:13:04,496
Advocate and Arun’s
dad are here…

826
01:13:10,704 --> 01:13:11,246
Sir,

827
01:13:11,412 --> 01:13:12,162
Mr.Ravi.

828
01:13:12,954 --> 01:13:14,096
Advocate Seetharaman…

829
01:13:14,121 --> 01:13:14,871
Hello..

830
01:13:15,454 --> 01:13:16,371
This is Arun’s father..

831
01:13:18,121 --> 01:13:19,339
This is Arun…

832
01:13:19,364 --> 01:13:20,956
Of course.

833
01:13:22,621 --> 01:13:23,579
You'd have see him

834
01:13:23,829 --> 01:13:24,621
Please…

835
01:13:25,329 --> 01:13:26,162
Sit down.

836
01:13:26,162 --> 01:13:26,621
It’s ok

837
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:27,325
It's ok, please…

838
01:13:38,746 --> 01:13:40,012
Sir,

839
01:13:40,037 --> 01:13:41,954
They've agreed to give you
five lakhs that you asked for…

840
01:13:43,412 --> 01:13:45,204
Take Rs.75,000 as advance
payment for now...

841
01:13:45,829 --> 01:13:47,912
We will settle the balance
once the case is over…

842
01:13:48,496 --> 01:13:50,079
You agreed to give me the
entire amount today..right?

843
01:13:52,162 --> 01:13:54,554
It is not that we
don’t trust you..

844
01:13:54,579 --> 01:13:57,204
It's difficult to arrange such
a big amount in short notice..

845
01:13:57,954 --> 01:13:59,346
The case is still
going on right?

846
01:13:59,371 --> 01:14:00,287
It'll be settled…

847
01:14:00,954 --> 01:14:01,996
BALAN : Yeah.. That’s it..

848
01:14:02,121 --> 01:14:03,162
No sir…

849
01:14:04,121 --> 01:14:05,554
Mr. Ravichandran,

850
01:14:05,579 --> 01:14:06,287
why don’t we try this?

851
01:14:07,496 --> 01:14:09,496
We can keep the money
in a bank locker..

852
01:14:10,204 --> 01:14:11,829
Let the key be with you..

853
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:13,664
You can take the money yourself
when the case is over…

854
01:14:13,746 --> 01:14:15,537
No sir...Please
give me the cash.

855
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:17,719
ARUN : Dad..

856
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:19,580
She was a bitch..

857
01:14:19,761 --> 01:14:21,636
She was hanging out
with me for my money..

858
01:14:21,954 --> 01:14:24,537
Why are you spending money on
eyewitness for such a lame case…

859
01:14:24,774 --> 01:14:26,191
ARUN's DAD : Hey Arun,
what are you talking ...

860
01:14:26,287 --> 01:14:27,662
It’s ok sir.. I will leave..

861
01:14:27,829 --> 01:14:28,704
No No.. please sit down…

862
01:14:30,388 --> 01:14:31,472
Be patient sir..

863
01:14:40,723 --> 01:14:42,723
There's one lakh in here..

864
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:44,191
Please take it for
the time being.

865
01:14:44,216 --> 01:14:47,299
We will settle the whole
amount once the case is over..

866
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:01,412
Tell me clearly..

867
01:15:01,437 --> 01:15:02,937
What did you see in
the house that day?

868
01:15:05,357 --> 01:15:06,982
When I was returning home,

869
01:15:07,529 --> 01:15:10,404
I saw Arun leaving the girl’s
house in a great hurry..

870
01:15:11,329 --> 01:15:13,329
He looked very angry.

871
01:15:13,821 --> 01:15:14,738
..uh..uh.. then?

872
01:15:15,248 --> 01:15:16,832
RAVI: Then i turn back

873
01:15:17,668 --> 01:15:21,309
RAVI : I saw the girl close
the door and go inside..

874
01:15:21,411 --> 01:15:25,036
Advocate : Ok.. hold on.. so after Arun
left Was the girl still inside the house?

875
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:29,121
Yeah.. She came, closed
the door and went inside.

876
01:15:30,262 --> 01:15:31,221
This is more than enough..

877
01:15:31,246 --> 01:15:32,412
Just say the exact
same thing in court,

878
01:15:32,412 --> 01:15:33,412
I'll handle the rest.

879
01:15:39,848 --> 01:15:42,432
So...you have decided it then.

880
01:15:44,245 --> 01:15:46,661
You are going to bribe and push
back 330 people in the queue.

881
01:15:46,686 --> 01:15:48,353
and get operated for your eye.

882
01:15:50,287 --> 01:15:50,912
Hmmm?

883
01:15:51,621 --> 01:15:53,371
‘Needs define Morality’

884
01:15:53,912 --> 01:15:55,566
You said it yourself.

885
01:15:57,579 --> 01:15:59,246
I also told you to ‘Think Good’.

886
01:16:00,496 --> 01:16:01,429
RAVI : So?

887
01:16:01,454 --> 01:16:03,454
try roaming around
half-blind..then you'll know.

888
01:16:04,579 --> 01:16:06,496
RAVI : You can sit comfortably
in your house and give advice…

889
01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:08,537
spending all your money
on making dolls…

890
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:17,079
I may not be helping others…
But I'm not hurting anybody…

891
01:16:17,409 --> 01:16:19,311
Have you even registered
to donate your eyes?

892
01:16:25,537 --> 01:16:27,246
Say...Will you be alive
another ten years?

893
01:16:34,996 --> 01:16:38,579
Leave here... Don’t
come here again..

894
01:17:00,063 --> 01:17:01,396
Anu…

895
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,189
Why are you standing here?...
No office?

896
01:17:07,496 --> 01:17:09,179
I lost my job

897
01:17:09,415 --> 01:17:10,040
Why?

898
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:14,771
I got you some phone numbers
the other day..right?

899
01:17:15,591 --> 01:17:18,591
The manager saw the paper in which
I had noted down the number…

900
01:17:22,787 --> 01:17:25,621
My brother keeps beating me
up because I lost my job…

901
01:19:13,476 --> 01:19:17,059
I'm not sure if the reason
behind this is them or you.

902
01:19:18,893 --> 01:19:20,268
and I don't want to know.

903
01:19:23,184 --> 01:19:26,201
But when they're ready to pay
Rs.5,00,000 without doing anything.

904
01:19:26,226 --> 01:19:27,643
How much should you pay?

905
01:19:32,283 --> 01:19:36,158
In court, I can prove that I
did not commit the murder..

906
01:19:38,986 --> 01:19:41,777
Your name will be tarnished beyond
repair before the case gets over…

907
01:19:43,447 --> 01:19:45,177
Do you even know
how many big shots

908
01:19:45,202 --> 01:19:46,868
have been brought to shame
due to alleged affairs?

909
01:19:50,102 --> 01:19:51,477
You are not single like me..

910
01:19:52,444 --> 01:19:55,118
Your daughter......she is
around 8 years old right?

911
01:19:55,549 --> 01:19:58,299
What will she think of
you when she finds out?

912
01:20:00,017 --> 01:20:02,433
Your wife.. She seems
to be very happy..

913
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:05,369
you love your
family a lot right?

914
01:20:06,544 --> 01:20:10,284
The money you pay me is the price
you pay for your entire life..

915
01:20:10,314 --> 01:20:12,814
Your's is love marriage right.?

916
01:20:25,285 --> 01:20:26,244
How much money do you want?

917
01:20:27,311 --> 01:20:28,436
Rs 25 lakhs

918
01:20:44,119 --> 01:20:46,630
Do you know the level
of influence I have?

919
01:20:48,249 --> 01:20:49,416
Do I look like a fool?

920
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,191
Bloody bastard..

921
01:20:54,744 --> 01:20:56,869
I'll tear you to bloody pieces…

922
01:20:57,516 --> 01:20:58,518
Son of a *****.

923
01:21:12,183 --> 01:21:16,100
My only mistake was that I
had a relationship with her.

924
01:21:20,291 --> 01:21:24,707
Everytime I was with her, I
wanted it to be the last time.

925
01:21:24,918 --> 01:21:28,053
But I couldn't stop there

926
01:21:28,369 --> 01:21:34,327
I don't know if the reason was my
age or the way she handled me.

927
01:21:35,408 --> 01:21:37,991
Advocate : According
to IPC section 302,

928
01:21:38,632 --> 01:21:43,632
The defence argue that Arun has
killed the girl named Swetha

929
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:45,418
In this regard

930
01:21:45,443 --> 01:21:48,276
Please permit me to call upon the
concerned Police Inspector..

931
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:54,432
Based on the information I got
around 5 am on June 22nd,

932
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:56,584
Me along with 5 constables
from my station

933
01:21:56,559 --> 01:21:57,601
Went to the scene of murder.

934
01:21:57,934 --> 01:21:59,726
We found Swetha’s
dead body there.

935
01:21:59,726 --> 01:22:00,849
Victim’s age 25.

936
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:02,582
Immediately, We brought
in the forensic team

937
01:22:02,607 --> 01:22:04,191
collected finger prints
and other evidence..

938
01:22:04,216 --> 01:22:08,191
I interrogated everybody
who knew the girl,

939
01:22:08,216 --> 01:22:09,466
and collected relevant details.

940
01:22:09,596 --> 01:22:13,388
I filed FIR on April 16 and submitted
the charge sheet to the court..

941
01:22:13,413 --> 01:22:15,621
Based on the letter
received from Inspector.

942
01:22:15,812 --> 01:22:18,395
Me along with three
other doctors,

943
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:21,684
performed postmortem on Swetha’a
body under my guidance.

944
01:22:21,909 --> 01:22:23,201
Based on the report...

945
01:22:23,226 --> 01:22:25,768
The primary reason of death is,

946
01:22:25,768 --> 01:22:28,559
4 inch deep wound on the neck.

947
01:22:29,368 --> 01:22:31,993
Due to a piercing on the
abdomen with a sharp tool,

948
01:22:32,018 --> 01:22:33,976
causing damages to
the intestines.

949
01:22:34,519 --> 01:22:41,934
The victim would've struggled around
half an hour to one hour before death.

950
01:22:42,027 --> 01:22:46,111
I will submitted detailed
postmortem report to the Court.

951
01:22:48,268 --> 01:22:50,309
Advocate : How long have
you known that girl?

952
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,422
For about six months..

953
01:22:52,447 --> 01:22:54,238
how would you describe
your relationship ?

954
01:22:54,351 --> 01:22:55,368
We are just friends.

955
01:22:55,393 --> 01:22:57,059
Is it just friendship or
something beyond that?

956
01:22:58,090 --> 01:22:59,299
It was just friendship.

957
01:22:59,324 --> 01:23:01,782
But we also did have
physical relationship.

958
01:23:02,393 --> 01:23:03,268
Ok

959
01:23:03,293 --> 01:23:04,668
What happened on
the day of murder?

960
01:23:05,488 --> 01:23:07,072
We met as usual on that day.

961
01:23:07,434 --> 01:23:08,018
Then?

962
01:23:08,457 --> 01:23:10,166
We started talking,

963
01:23:12,559 --> 01:23:14,976
but at one point it
turned into a fight.

964
01:23:15,001 --> 01:23:15,918
So, I just left.

965
01:23:16,093 --> 01:23:17,301
What did you guys fight about?

966
01:23:23,676 --> 01:23:25,760
She asked me if we
could get married.

967
01:23:26,012 --> 01:23:27,429
I refused and left the place...

968
01:23:28,468 --> 01:23:29,968
Please make a note
of this your honor..

969
01:23:29,993 --> 01:23:31,451
No no...Nothing like that..

970
01:23:31,476 --> 01:23:32,913
Only answer what you
are asked for..

971
01:23:33,272 --> 01:23:36,230
In police investigation, you
said you didn't know her.

972
01:23:36,434 --> 01:23:37,559
I said that out of fear..

973
01:23:37,707 --> 01:23:38,874
Even now you re doing the same.

974
01:23:38,899 --> 01:23:39,732
No sir...

975
01:23:39,757 --> 01:23:44,132
You fought with her and when she
insisted on marriage you beat her up.

976
01:23:44,791 --> 01:23:47,707
Then you murdered the
girl and fled the house.

977
01:23:48,354 --> 01:23:49,562
This is my opinion.

978
01:23:49,848 --> 01:23:50,432
No…

979
01:23:51,476 --> 01:23:52,643
That's all, your honour..

980
01:23:54,059 --> 01:23:57,559
Fine... How many times have
you seen Arun in that house?

981
01:23:58,226 --> 01:23:59,393
I have seen him multiple times..

982
01:24:00,309 --> 01:24:03,318
At times I've even seen him leave
the house early in the morning..

983
01:24:03,934 --> 01:24:07,934
So, you have been watching
that house day and night?

984
01:24:09,059 --> 01:24:12,976
No.. I smoke in my Balcony…Thats
when I saw all this.

985
01:24:14,351 --> 01:24:17,184
Ok, what happened on
the day of murder?

986
01:24:18,951 --> 01:24:20,618
I was returning home from work

987
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:24,845
and I saw Arun come out of the house
angrily and leave in his car…

988
01:24:25,022 --> 01:24:25,939
After that?

989
01:24:26,434 --> 01:24:27,559
After that, I went home.

990
01:24:29,137 --> 01:24:31,887
Did you not see the girl
come out of the entrance?

991
01:24:32,361 --> 01:24:33,236
Advocate : Objection,
your honour..

992
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:35,851
No, After that there was
no movement in the house

993
01:24:39,226 --> 01:24:39,851
What?

994
01:24:40,434 --> 01:24:41,059
Wait..

995
01:24:47,726 --> 01:24:48,351
Fine...

996
01:24:48,757 --> 01:24:49,965
I'll give you the
money you asked for..

997
01:24:52,869 --> 01:24:54,610
But one condition.

998
01:24:58,651 --> 01:25:01,142
You must leave to a
far away city...

999
01:25:02,979 --> 01:25:05,395
I should never see you
again in my life..

1000
01:25:05,938 --> 01:25:07,396
JUDGE: In Swetha's Murder Case,

1001
01:25:07,421 --> 01:25:11,296
based on the arguments put forth by
the defence and the prosecution,

1002
01:25:11,684 --> 01:25:17,809
Arun has agreed that he had a fight
with Swetha on the day of murder..

1003
01:25:18,398 --> 01:25:21,148
But he claims that
it was just a fight

1004
01:25:21,173 --> 01:25:26,839
and it did not lead to a murder This
is not acceptable by the court.

1005
01:25:26,909 --> 01:25:30,367
Moreover, the defence witness
Ravi has testified that

1006
01:25:30,476 --> 01:25:34,309
he has seen frequent fights
between Swetha and Arun.

1007
01:25:34,681 --> 01:25:38,056
Based on all the evidences and
testimonies presented so far,

1008
01:25:38,476 --> 01:25:42,518
the court believes that there is reasonable
doubt that Arun has committed the murder…

1009
01:25:43,108 --> 01:25:47,983
So the court rules against the
prosecution in this case.

1010
01:25:48,457 --> 01:25:57,249
The accused will be given a lifetime sentence
based on IPC 302 and a fine of Rs.40,000.

1011
01:25:57,601 --> 01:26:03,309
In case of lapse in paying the amount, he has
to serve six months additional jail time.

1012
01:26:54,887 --> 01:26:55,637
What?

1013
01:26:57,715 --> 01:26:59,007
Can you not see
what I am showing?

1014
01:27:01,533 --> 01:27:03,199
Why did you hide this from me?

1015
01:27:15,143 --> 01:27:16,809
Swetha, come get on the bike..

1016
01:27:17,015 --> 01:27:18,557
No that’s ok, I can
go by myself..

1017
01:27:25,518 --> 01:27:26,351
Arun : Hey, wheres your house?

1018
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,511
Just here...

1019
01:27:27,536 --> 01:27:28,161
There?

1020
01:27:28,851 --> 01:27:29,893
Yeah, Come home..

1021
01:27:30,268 --> 01:27:31,331
Some other time..

1022
01:27:33,476 --> 01:27:34,226
Ok, bye.. see you later..

1023
01:27:34,226 --> 01:27:35,143
Hey,

1024
01:27:35,268 --> 01:27:36,059
When can we meet again?

1025
01:27:37,074 --> 01:27:38,454
I will give you a call...

1026
01:28:14,768 --> 01:28:15,601
Ravi

1027
01:28:16,595 --> 01:28:18,053
I did love you for real...

1028
01:28:19,101 --> 01:28:20,184
I'm not denying that..

1029
01:28:23,744 --> 01:28:25,910
But when I think about
living with you

1030
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,293
it does not feel right to me...

1031
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:29,770
That MD (Managing Director)...

1032
01:28:31,309 --> 01:28:33,809
wants me to hang with
him if I need the job..

1033
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:37,264
And Arun...

1034
01:28:37,289 --> 01:28:38,414
After all that he did to me...

1035
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,355
he'll marry only the girl
his parents find for him.

1036
01:28:45,249 --> 01:28:48,541
Even now, I'm not judging you..

1037
01:28:49,979 --> 01:28:51,687
Why? Go ahead and judge me…

1038
01:28:53,295 --> 01:28:54,128
Yes...

1039
01:28:55,101 --> 01:28:56,559
I am a bad girl...

1040
01:29:00,019 --> 01:29:01,644
Please leave all
of this behind...

1041
01:29:01,741 --> 01:29:03,449
i'll accept you for
what you are...

1042
01:29:09,518 --> 01:29:10,852
First of all,

1043
01:29:11,076 --> 01:29:14,409
see if you can fix your
half broken vision…

1044
01:29:14,434 --> 01:29:16,809
Then we can consider about
you giving me a life..

1045
01:29:17,722 --> 01:29:20,594
For your status I shouldn't even
have left you come near me.

1046
01:30:12,434 --> 01:30:17,018
After few years

1047
01:31:16,676 --> 01:31:18,727
What are you thinking about?

1048
01:31:39,237 --> 01:31:40,410
Doctor : Hello,

1049
01:31:43,747 --> 01:31:45,119
You are the patient
with Glaucoma,

1050
01:31:45,642 --> 01:31:47,356
tunnel vision right?

1051
01:31:47,713 --> 01:31:48,463
Yes, Doctor..

1052
01:31:49,566 --> 01:31:50,942
How are you feeling now?

1053
01:31:51,002 --> 01:31:52,668
I have paid the fees and
waiting for the operation now…

1054
01:31:53,434 --> 01:31:54,518
Oh..Have you paid the fees?

1055
01:31:54,893 --> 01:31:55,601
Yes..why?

1056
01:31:56,059 --> 01:31:57,851
Sorry Don't mistake me.

1057
01:31:58,775 --> 01:32:00,743
There are certain things
about the hospital

1058
01:32:00,768 --> 01:32:02,434
that I cannot talk
openly about..

1059
01:32:03,143 --> 01:32:04,601
There was a lot of
pressure from Management

1060
01:32:05,726 --> 01:32:07,018
I don’t work there anymore..

1061
01:32:07,143 --> 01:32:08,851
I suggested you to get a
second opinion.. right?

1062
01:32:09,793 --> 01:32:11,377
Didn’t you ask for one?

1063
01:32:13,159 --> 01:32:13,867
Uh… No…

1064
01:32:14,059 --> 01:32:16,018
There is no cure for
your eye problem…

1065
01:32:16,893 --> 01:32:20,226
Even an eye transplant wont help
as this is a retinal issue.

1066
01:32:22,386 --> 01:32:27,095
(Voice Over) You intend or not?
you have done a mistake.

1067
01:32:28,425 --> 01:32:29,913
You can escape the law for
the crime you committed.

1068
01:32:31,832 --> 01:32:35,096
But your conscience will
start questioning you

1069
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:38,660
one day. See if you can
escape that curse.
