1
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,040
'ACHAYANS'
- "Achayans.."

2
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,200
"Achayans.."

3
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,000
"Achayans.."

4
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,360
"Want to make them stop.."

5
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,960
"Hey."

6
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,440
"Want to make them stop.."

7
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,720
"Shake it. Shake your booty now.."

8
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,680
"Shake it.. Dirty.. Hey, curly!
Shake your booty now."

9
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,120
"Shake your booty now.
Shake it. Dirty.."

10
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,120
"Cut it. Shake your booty now..
Shake it. Dirty.."

11
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,480
"Cut it.
Shake your booty now."

12
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,280
"Achayans.."

13
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,560
"Achayans..
Hey."

14
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,400
"Hey."

15
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,680
"Achayans.."

16
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,720
"Achayans.."

17
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,640
"Achayans.."

18
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,280
The Thottathil family is one among
the most renowned families

19
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,680
of Kochi.

20
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,920
The current head of
this family is Varkey Vavachan

21
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,360
the person who is
wearing his specs right now.

22
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,560
This is his wife,
Mrs. Eliyamma Vavachan.

23
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,440
How do I look?

24
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,800
Their main hobby is taking
photographs every week

25
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,480
wearing the same kind of clothes
and hanging it on the walls.

26
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,840
Eliyamma.
- Yes.

27
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,560
Who will serve our son breakfast
if you go to the church?

28
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,560
I will keep it on the table.

29
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,440
I can't move my neck.

30
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,160
He didn't do it purposefully.
Leave it.

31
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,920
The person lying on the bed
is the son they were talking about.

32
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,400
He wakes up when sunlight
hits his back and disturbs him.

33
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,480
It's morning again.

34
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,800
He is the only son who
was born to the couple

35
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,160
after a lot of prayers
and treatments.

36
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,640
Tony Thottathil.

37
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,400
He follows his daily routine
without fail.

38
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,200
He has breakfast
at 1.30 p.m. - Practice.

39
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,600
It doesn't matter if he's
brushed his teeth or not.

40
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,800
My poor baby.

41
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
He has lunch at sharp 4 p.m.

42
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,480
He goes to work at 6 p.m.

43
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,440
'Wear helmets for safety.'

44
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,040
Cheers.

45
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,520
As you can see, Tony has started
working with his colleagues.

46
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,560
Shall we begin?

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,520
'Smoking and alcohol consumption
are injurious to health.'

48
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,400
It's just a few drinks.

49
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,160
Tony came back early blaming the
government for alcohol scarcity.

50
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,320
Now, the time is sharp 4 a.m.

51
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,880
I am here.

52
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,040
Mom.
- Oh, no!

53
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,280
It's a ghost!
- What?

54
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,160
Son.
- What is it?

55
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,040
Is that you, Son?
I was about to scream!

56
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,400
I am sorry, Mom.
- Not now, Son.

57
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,040
I made a mistake.

58
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,240
I will not drink alcohol anymore.

59
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,600
I won't make this mistake again.

60
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,040
I am telling the truth, Mom.

61
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,880
Let it go, Son.
Did you have something?

62
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,120
I had eight pegs of alcohol.
- Jesus!

63
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,760
Not that. Did you have food?
- No, Mom.

64
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,520
I am hungry.
- Go.

65
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,200
Get him something to eat.
- Yes.

66
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,440
Come on, son. I will make 'Puttu'
and chicken fry. - Chicken..

67
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,240
Son. let me..
- Look at my dad!

68
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,360
Okay.
- Show me your head.

69
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
I will swear upon your head.
- Oh, no.

70
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,720
No, Son.
- No..

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,600
You did the same
thing to me last week.

72
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,480
I couldn't remove
this collar after that.

73
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,800
'Last week'.
- Oh, Mother Mary..

74
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,880
'Last week'
- I won't drink again, Dad.

75
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,080
I swear on you.

76
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,800
Oh, Jesus.

77
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,800
Bite it.

78
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,560
Why are you wearing underwear
on your neck, Dad?

79
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,640
There is someone who has decided
to marry only Tony in her life.

80
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,040
That's Jessica, the only daughter
of the rich Pallikal George.

81
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,480
Jesus!
82
00:07:08:960 --> 00:07:09:840
Jessicca.

82
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,520
Take a look at this photograph.

83
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,840
He owns a cashew nut factory
in Kollam.

84
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,080
He is from a good family.

85
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,560
He is handsome as well.

86
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,880
I don't want him.
I want Tony.

87
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,200
Tony!
You should rather commit suicide.

88
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,120
I won't kill myself.

89
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,600
I will kill you if you don't
get me married to him.

90
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,720
You can marry him.

91
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,400
Don't ask me for my liver
when his fails. - What is this?

92
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,440
Get lost.
- No need. I will give mine.

93
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,280
Do as you please.
- Why does one need two livers?

94
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,600
This person walking in slow motion
is Aby Thottathil.

95
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,200
He is the son of
Tony's eldest uncle.

96
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,800
Hey, he's coming here.
Aby Thottathil!

97
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,960
Scoundrel.
- Come on.

98
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,320
Come on.
- Hey.

99
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,280
Come here.
- Come.

100
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Stop there. You shouldn't ask
for more trouble by going inside.
101
00:08:00:080 --> 00:08:02:840
He is the youth leader
of PC George's party.

101
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,280
A young Turk!

102
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,960
"Run around town, people
trying to get down.." - Hey.

103
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,000
Who is it?

104
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,400
How dare you burn our flag!

105
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,800
"Run around town,
people trying to get down.."

106
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,920
Who dares to fight us!

107
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,920
Hey.
- Come here.

108
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,680
He is a smart guy.

109
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,560
He invites trouble.

110
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,600
Let's go.
- Stop there. Run.

111
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,960
Sir, they burnt our flag.

112
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,520
Come on.
Come to our lair.
113
00:09:02:200 --> 00:09:06:240
What is this?
Do you tear flags like little kids?

113
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,120
You shouldn't. Don't try to mess
with me.

114
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,760
You are way out of your league!
- Let's go.

115
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,720
Come on. We will always
get the support of the public.

116
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,400
"Hard to make it, break it down..
The music will just ooze."

117
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,440
This is Rafi.

118
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,800
He is Tony's and Aby's friend
who spoils them a lot.

119
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,800
We can even call him
their partner in crime.

120
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,960
"We're just cool. Watch us chop
it up and make it feel brutal!"

121
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
"Hard to make it, break it.."

122
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,760
Praise the Lord.
- Now and forever!

123
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,480
Marriage is the only
solution to cure

124
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,520
the addiction to alcohol
and gambling.

125
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,800
He will become responsible if he
gets married. - Laddu..

126
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,760
I want Laddu. - Dear..
- Tony will stop drinking.

127
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,240
Wait and watch.
- It's risky, Father.

128
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,240
Aren't they both dear to us,
George? Everything will be fine.

129
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,240
Yes..
- Shouldn't we ask Roy?

130
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,440
It's necessary.
He is the elder one.

131
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,400
Let's fix the date later.

132
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,320
Okay, Father. - Anyway,
everything's been decided. - Yes.

133
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,120
Where is it?

134
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,360
What are you looking for?

135
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,240
I had kept my bag here.

136
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,400
It has three bottles of wine
for the holy mass.

137
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,960
That is gone.

138
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,280
Mass wine!

139
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,440
Tasteless!

140
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,720
I know how to control
Tony after marriage.

141
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Sister!

142
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,480
Do you really want to
bring this upon yourself?

143
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,520
"Without knowing"

144
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,840
"without dreaming"

145
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,320
"love drenched me like rain."

146
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,960
"When you rest on my chest"

147
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,320
"like a gentle breeze"

148
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,440
"I will caress you, dear."

149
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,800
"When your dreams bloom"

150
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,160
"the silent words gain voice."

151
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,760
"Without knowing"

152
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,960
"without dreaming"

153
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,560
"love drenched me like rain."

154
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,960
"When you rest on my heart.."

155
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,040
Kids should learn from Roy.

156
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,840
He made all these
with his hard work.

157
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,880
Do you know that?

158
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,360
Why is Roy still single?

159
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,160
Because he has brains.
- Shut up. - Okay.

160
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,560
Suzy,
the Holy Mass is at 10 a.m.

161
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,040
Come on time.
- Okay.

162
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,240
Has Roy called?
- There is no news of him.

163
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,720
Tony said his phone
is switched off.

164
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,320
Where is he?

165
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,280
Roy Abraham Mathew
aka Thottathil Roy.

166
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,520
The eldest son
of Thottathil Family.

167
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,720
Role model of his brothers.

168
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,480
It's not him.

169
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,600
Spirit of the forest!

170
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,680
There is no network.
171
00:13:02:360 --> 00:13:03:200
Roy.

171
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,040
It's me, Velu.

172
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,400
Hello.

173
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,160
Who?
Roy?

174
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,040
Everyone, get in. - Sir.
- Roy went into the forest.

175
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,760
He should not take it.
Come on, fast.

176
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,960
Hey, stop!
177
00:14:36:720 --> 00:14:39:240
Spirit of the forest!

177
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,080
Three generations old arrack

178
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,240
lies on the river bed
of Kallada.

179
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,920
God!
- Great!

180
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,600
So this is why you
went to the forest!

181
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,600
Roy!

182
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,880
You are great!

183
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,880
Roy!

184
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,400
Don't cry, dear.

185
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,120
Where will we drink this?
- Everything is ready.

186
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,560
Come on, dear.

187
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,400
Coming.

188
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,120
What is this?
Why are we hunching?

189
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,520
Great!

190
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,000
Are you here?

191
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,400
I thought the boat sunk when
I saw the fire engines.

192
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,360
Such a waste. - Shut up!
- Is everyone all right?

193
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,280
Or the food will go waste.
- Nothing will go wasted.

194
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,160
They never miss a good treat.

195
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,680
They are my brothers.
- It's written on their faces.

196
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,600
Hey, is everything ready?
- Yes.

197
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
High-tech!

198
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,160
There is plenty of food.
- Food is on me.

199
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,520
Do we have wild meat?

200
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,760
No wild meat in the world
can satisfy you!

201
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,600
I have no interest in it!

202
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,520
Oh, God.
Sudharman is a great cook.

203
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,120
But now, he is in hiding.

204
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,760
Hiding?
Why?

205
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,920
A small case.

206
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,520
I cooked Biryani for a wedding
with 300 chickens.

207
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,320
A case for cooking Biryani?
- Why not?

208
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,400
I wanted 300 chickens.
I couldn't find a dealer.

209
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,840
So, I poisoned the chicken.

210
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,720
All 300 died.

211
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,400
I cooked awesome Biryani.

212
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,200
There were no problems.

213
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,040
But the bride's father died.

214
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,720
How come only he died?
A greedy hen had eaten more poison.

215
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,920
The bride's father
ate that chicken.

216
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,960
The hen was careless. At least, he
should've been more careful, right?

217
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,560
Cheers.
- Cheers.

218
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,120
Spirit of the forest!

219
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,960
Should we add water?
- Water! What are you saying?

220
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,120
This is elixir.

221
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,640
There is a scientific way
to drink it.

222
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,880
Watch me. Don't drink it
like how you usually do.

223
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,960
Drink like this.

224
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,280
Jesus!
225
00:17:02:400 --> 00:17:04:000
You can add some water.

225
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,400
Very little.

226
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,320
What?
Who mixes water in arrack?

227
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,880
Water is necessary.
God!

228
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
What do you do, Roy?

229
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,880
Have you heard of Marayur?
- I will.

230
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,680
Half of it belongs to the
government and rest to him.

231
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,280
He has farms there.
- Agriculture!

232
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,360
Pepper and grass.
- Why?

233
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,040
Some cannabis plants
here and there.

234
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,280
Only for household purposes.

235
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,880
He makes great cocktails.

236
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,240
A chronic bachelor.

237
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,320
His biggest weakness is woman.

238
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,600
His favourite holiday spot
is Pattaya, Bangkok.

239
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,760
What does do there?
- Plucking weeds.

240
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,840
"Drink arrack to see
stars in the morning."

241
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,760
"Drink, fight and sleep
when you get tired."

242
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,720
"Music will come to you."

243
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,520
"Chorus will come
to sing along."

244
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,600
"Drink and puke."

245
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,440
"Make your drink your friend."

246
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,320
"Drink it like water."

247
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,240
"And dance till your drop."

248
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:31,040
"Drink till
you lose consciousness."

249
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,440
"Drink arrack to see
stars in the morning."

250
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,240
"Drink, fight and sleep
when you get tired."
251
00:19:14:440 --> 00:19:20:280
"Tomorrow, the world
will be ruled by the ale."

251
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,960
"The day will come where
everyone becomes equal."

252
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,960
A full boat to there."

253
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,760
"Only half will come back."

254
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,880
"Mix the elixir in water."

255
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,600
"And fly to the paradise."

256
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,600
"To dance and be merry"

257
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,040
"make this clear liquid
your best friend."

258
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,840
Everyone's happy.
Thank you.

259
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,960
The groom is a drunkard,
isn't he?
260
00:20:00:160 --> 00:20:01:600
It was her choice.
I couldn't oppose.

260
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,640
Uncle, is it time
for the bride to leave?

261
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,080
Yes, ask them to start.

262
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,040
Oh, Jesus!

263
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,240
It is time for the holy mass,
George.

264
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,200
Where is the groom?

265
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,680
He hasn't come yet, Father.
- It's getting late, George.

266
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,840
Jesus!

267
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,360
Where's my son?

268
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,880
Sir, we looked for him everywhere.

269
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,440
He is nowhere to be seen.

270
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,600
George.

271
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,640
What do we do now?

272
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,320
I don't know.
273
00:21:01:600 --> 00:21:02:880
My God!

273
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,920
You answered my prayers.
I am happy.

274
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,880
I am happy.

275
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,440
What are you saying, George?

276
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,120
Even God doesn't approve
of this wedding.

277
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,120
My daughter is saved.

278
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,720
Thank you, God.
- Dear.

279
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,520
Praise the Lord.
- Daughter.

280
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,560
Oh, no!
Someone fell!

281
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
Who is that?
Who fell?

282
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,400
Who fell in the water?

283
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,480
Oh, no!

284
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,400
It was this barrel.

285
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,640
Oh, Jesus! It's 11' o clock.
The wedding!

286
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,720
Oh, no. Tony!

287
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,480
Get up, Tony. - What's he saying?
The wedding!

288
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,680
Aby, get up.
- No! - It's his wedding today.

289
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,040
I will call Mr. PC.

290
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,440
Stop sleeping. Get up!
It's his wedding today.

291
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,360
Khan. My name is Khan.
- Tony! Tony, come!

292
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,440
Come, dear.
Come.

293
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,440
Mr. Roy, let him sleep.
Today is a Sunday.

294
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,040
It's his wedding today.

295
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,440
Really? He is sleeping as if his
funeral is going on!

296
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,360
Tony, get up.
Get up, sweetheart!

297
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Leave them here.
Let us go and attend the wedding.

298
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,720
I bathed.
You can take a bath.

299
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,520
Fool, it is his wedding.

300
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,160
Do one thing.
Wake them and get them ready.

301
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,040
Let me leave early.

302
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,400
The Spirits of the forest have
betrayed us. - Tony!

303
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,600
He is hurrying as if he wants
to use the washroom!

304
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,200
Tony, wake up.

305
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,880
Today is your last day.
- What?

306
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,440
Yes.
It's your wedding today.

307
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,160
Everyone has left.
That's done.

308
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,080
Christ!

309
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,840
Roy, where were you?
Where is Tony?

310
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,960
He fled.
- What?

311
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,840
He fled.
- What?

312
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,760
I chased him when I heard his car
at 1 a.m. yesterday. - God!

313
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,120
But in vain.
He fled.

314
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,600
They can't be trusted..

315
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,760
Roy, even you couldn't stop..
- Yes, that is my grief.

316
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
He should be..

317
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,080
Praise the Lord.
- Roy, where's.. - Fled.

318
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,640
I don't know. He fled.

319
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,000
How's Jessica?
- She is all fine.

320
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,720
I don't care about the money spent.

321
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
God saved her life.

322
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,120
Where is God?
- What?

323
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,600
I mean, Jessica..
Sorry.

324
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,760
Where is Jessica?

325
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,160
She is inside.
- Okay. - Poor girl.

326
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,720
Jessica, stop crying.

327
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,280
Think that you escaped from
a bigger danger.

328
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,000
Get lost!
329
00:24:05:960 --> 00:24:08:040
I loved him very much.

329
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,520
And yet,
he cheated me, Roy.

330
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,160
I will conduct your wedding.

331
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,040
They should be punished.

332
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,640
Shut your mouth.
- What is this?

333
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,400
Keep quiet.
- Roy.

334
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,800
He is a fraud.

335
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,640
Get lost, drunkard.

336
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,080
They won't reform.

337
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,320
They can't be changed.

338
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,720
Gosh!
I am not able to control my anger.

339
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,240
We should do something.

340
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,120
No need.

341
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,120
No, we should.

342
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,680
Tony and Jessica
should have a good life.

343
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,320
Yes. - We should retain
our family's reputation. - Yes.

344
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,160
What is the solution for that?
- Tell us, Father.

345
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,080
There is a solution for that.

346
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,040
What is it?

347
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,200
Let them come back
after two week's retreat.

348
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,520
Everything will be fine.

349
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,760
A retreat is being held at
Parepally Church.

350
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,440
Isn't that done yet?

351
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,600
The wedding will be held after
they are back from the retreat.

352
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,560
Thank God!
- That's good, Father.

353
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,640
They are too spoilt
for their age.

354
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,480
Roy.
- Yes.

355
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,960
You should look after them.

356
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
Okay. Did you hear him?
- You must also participate in it.

357
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,080
Okay. What?
- Yes.

358
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,160
I can't attend it now.

359
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,840
It is because I am busy
with some plans in Marayur.

360
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,800
Don't say anything.
You must go along with them.

361
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,080
But my agriculture..
- Roy.

362
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,640
They are your cousins.
- Yes.

363
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,520
You are responsible.
- Mom, but agriculture..

364
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,920
You must go, Uncle.
- Yes.

365
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,640
He's in a fix.

366
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,720
Get ready for the journey.
- Okay.

367
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,840
I will make the arrangements there.

368
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,040
Okay, Father.
- Okay.

369
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,240
I am happy, Father.
Please come.

370
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,240
You plan all the pranks together.
Take him along with you.

371
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,400
He might reform.

372
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,240
Me?
Why should I go?

373
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,280
You are correct.
He must be reformed. - Sure.

374
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,760
Tony, take him.
Let's reform him.

375
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Vavachan,
she is my only daughter.

376
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,680
Is it my fault, George?

377
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,440
Gosh!

378
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,520
'Parepally Retreat Centre.'

379
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,880
"Oh, traveller from Zion"

380
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,960
"don't panic when you see
the hurdles.." - Stop there!

381
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,680
Jeez.
She killed the flow.

382
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,240
Tony.
- Roy.

383
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,720
Turn.

384
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,880
Tony.
- Mother.

385
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,720
Come back as a changed man.
May God bless you!

386
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,640
The wedding is on the fourth.
We will start on the third.

387
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,400
No need.
- What? - What?

388
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,760
Don't come on the day
before the wedding.

389
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,480
I can't take the risk again.

390
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,880
What about the facial?
Oh, no!

391
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,360
Come directly to the church
on the fourth.

392
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Praise the Lord.
I was about to tell them the same.

393
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,480
Tony.
- Yes.

394
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,040
Please reform.

395
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,440
I will.

396
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,960
We must face the people
who mocked us. Okay? - Okay.

397
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,080
"Oh, traveller from Zion"

398
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,080
"don't panic when you see
the hurdles that come by."

399
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,480
"God Almighty is with you."

400
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,200
"A person who can control you
is present here also."

401
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,280
You mean, the God?

402
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,600
No, Father Jose Keerikkadan.

403
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,960
Is he related to Keerikkadan Jose?

404
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,200
No.

405
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,240
Praise the Lord.

406
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,760
I am here to help them reform.

407
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,600
Praise the Lord.

408
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,760
You will reform.

409
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,880
So soon?

410
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,960
The drunkards who came before
you, sneaked alcohol in. - How?

411
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,880
Praise the Lord.

412
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,480
Father came to know of it.
They'll face the consequences now.

413
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,400
Never try to fool the father.

414
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,720
God!

415
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,800
"Keerikkadan.."

416
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,080
"Keerikkadan."

417
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,560
"Keerikkadan."
- Did you think I won't know

418
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,120
if you hide the bottle
inside the cupboard?

419
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,280
I will find it out

420
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,960
wherever you hide it.

421
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,920
The bottle is made of plastic.

422
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,440
Praise the Lord, Father.
- "Keerikkadan."

423
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,240
"Keerikkadan.."
- Father, those four have come.

424
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,280
Praise the Lord, Father.

425
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,960
Sounds like a group song
from 'Doordarshan'.

426
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,840
Look, Mr. Roy.
- Not Roy. I am Tony.

427
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,160
Do you know what I have to say,
Mr. Roy?

428
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,040
I am Rafi.

429
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,440
Mr. Roy, you must understand..
- I am Aby. Aby.

430
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,880
Hey, Aby.
- I am Roy.

431
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,680
My God!

432
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,320
People who come here
hardly remember their names.

433
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,360
At least, you guys remember that.

434
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,840
That is a good sign.
- Thank you.

435
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,520
It's not because I have the time
or the resources to reform you.

436
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,080
It's because the vicar general
requested.

437
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,920
Prankster.
- The vicar general?

438
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,080
No, you guys! He wants
me to do it myself.

439
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,360
Geez!
What's that?

440
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,520
Nothing.
It's the phone vibrating.

441
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,720
Hello.

442
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,720
Not tomorrow. The VSOP
is on the day after tomorrow.

443
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,080
What?
- What? - Nice!

444
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,720
Do you want to join?
- Yes. - Sure.

445
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,480
Cheers! - Four people
will be accompanying me.

446
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,520
They are new here.
Okay.

447
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,040
Father, I'm excited about VSOP.

448
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,040
Yes. VSOP stands for 'Valorous
Sebastian's Oblation Party'.

449
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,080
We'll go together.
- Damn.

450
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,160
Father.

451
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,120
I was not aware that you encourage
such talents here.

452
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,280
It's not a talent.

453
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,240
His hands are quivering
as he hasn't drunk.

454
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,440
So I handed him a mridangam.

455
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,920
What about the smaller one
near him?

456
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,880
He asked me if I could I buy him
a 'small'. So, I did.

457
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,760
"Don't cry.."
- He is a poor fellow!

458
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,080
He killed his mother and wife
and threw his father into the well.

459
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,240
There is a reformed person
amongst you.

460
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,160
Yes, Father. - There's one more.
Where is Sugathan?

461
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,120
He is a completely changed man.
Glory!

462
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,560
Tell them.
Let the people know.

463
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,240
I had committed many mistakes.

464
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,320
This priest has made
me who I am today.

465
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,640
Everybody, applaud!

466
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,360
Sugathan was a spoilt man.

467
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,960
Sugathan lead a bad life.
Come on, Sugathan. Tell them.

468
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,520
I used to drink
from morning to night.

469
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,720
I was an alcoholic.
I didn't commit any other sin.

470
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,080
No.. You are lying, Sugathan.
- He is innocent.

471
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,720
You have stolen when
you were drunk. - No, Father.

472
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,320
You have stolen things.
- Yes, Father.

473
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,080
You have done it.
Tell me, Sugathan.

474
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,120
Yes, Father.

475
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,720
Friends, Sugathan was a thief.
- What? - A big thief.

476
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,560
Sugathan has decided not to steal
and has chosen a new life.

477
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,680
Sugathan, you have made
more mistakes. - No, Father.

478
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,280
No. - I understood that you had
coveted someone else's wife.

479
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,640
What? - I have understood.
Tell me, Sugathan. - Once I had.

480
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,800
What? - You desired
someone else's wife.

481
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,880
Sugathan desired another man's wife

482
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,560
and interfered in their personal
life. - What?

483
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,920
Sugathan won't repeat this.
- Yes.

484
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,040
This is his new life. - Father.
- Sugathan.. Tell me.

485
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,480
Sugathan has committed some other
mistakes. You have. Tell me.

486
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,920
Father.
- Sugathan, tell me what you did.

487
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,120
I killed someone!

488
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,960
Sugathan!
- I killed someone, Father.

489
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,040
I killed someone!
- You are kidding!

490
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,560
I shall confess,
Father.

491
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,440
Use this microphone.
- Paul Azad was my close friend.

492
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,560
He didn't invite me
for his marriage.

493
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,000
I smashed the beer bottle while
we were drinking

494
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,320
and stabbed it in his stomach
to take revenge for that.

495
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,960
Look!
I stabbed him with this hand.

496
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,360
He died! I killed him!

497
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,520
The court let me go.

498
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,080
Do you know why? There was no
proof because it happened at night.

499
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,640
I spent a lot of money for it.

500
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,720
But I am a culprit in front
of my conscience, Father.

501
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,120
I killed my close friend.
- Sugathan, please don't cry.

502
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,960
Don't make me cry.
- Don't cry.

503
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,600
Sugathan, you regret it.

504
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,440
That's because you are good
at heart. I forgive you, Sugathan.

505
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,880
Sugathan is a good man.

506
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,240
I feel relieved.
You relieved me, Father.

507
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,080
'The video in which Sugathan
admitted that he killed someone'

508
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,840
'went viral on social media.'

509
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,720
'The court filed a case on its own'

510
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,440
'and asked the police to arrest
Sugathan.' - What? - Please, no.

511
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,840
'The police arrested Sugathan at
the retreat centre this evening.'

512
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,760
You rascal.

513
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,520
'Sugathan threatened Father
Jose Keerikkadan before he left.'

514
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,920
Dear friend, don't say anything
to him. He will trap us. - Yes..

515
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,560
Praise the Lord, Father..
- Yes..

516
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,320
He got more than what he asked for!

517
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,760
Think about Jesus and have it.

518
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,760
I didn't value alcohol when I had
it. What can I do?

519
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,840
That's not the proverb.
- I don't care. I want alcohol.

520
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,760
I want alcohol right now.

521
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,400
I am going to eat.
- Let the fruits come.

522
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,320
I am really hungry.

523
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,360
Don't you want to eat, Tony?
- A tonic?

524
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,640
What tonic?
- I said Tony, not tonic.

525
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,320
I am going to have rice porridge.
- Sit there.

526
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,560
Let them bring the fruits.

527
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,920
It's been a long time.
- When will you get the fruits?

528
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,920
I am not hungry but I can't stop
having porridge, Father.

529
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,320
How will I control
their food intake?

530
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,880
What?
- Don't be scared.

531
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,480
Father is here.
- What?

532
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,920
Father.
- What!

533
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,680
Don't you want food, rebels?

534
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,800
We eat fruits at night.
- Okay.

535
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,040
I am allowing food from outside
because the vicar general

536
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,480
has sent you here and
you are bringing only fruits.

537
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,880
Here.
- Hey..

538
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,280
I have told you many times not
to spit here.

539
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,440
No, Father.
- Go to the backyard..

540
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,720
How dare he spit at
the place where I pee.

541
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,800
Did you read the Bible?

542
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,240
We will do it after having fruits.
- Okay.

543
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,080
Did you pray the rosary?
- We'll do it after having fruits.

544
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,720
Did you switch off the lights when
you came from your room?

545
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,120
We will do it when we
go back after having the fruits.

546
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,000
Did you just give birth or
something to eat so many fruits?

547
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,080
No, Father. We've been eating
fruits every day after we came here.

548
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,080
Actually, it is good.

549
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,640
A natural lifestyle
is always the best.

550
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,760
Did you eat something, Father?

551
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,800
No. I don't eat porridge like them
and fruits like you.

552
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,840
I follow a strict diet.
- Okay.

553
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,920
Father.
- Yes.

554
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,440
I'll keep the pork curry and
Paratha for you in the room.

555
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,280
I didn't get Tandoori Chicken.
- Okay.

556
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,240
I don't eat fruits and porridge.
I eat only pork and Paratha.

557
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,840
Stop there..

558
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,560
Are these fruits?
Oh, Jesus!

559
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,520
I am too hungry.
- Oh, my!

560
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,320
Oh, my! Our fruits..
- What is this?

561
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,440
Fruits! Careful! Slowly..

562
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
Stop..
- Slowly.. - I have a doubt.

563
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,160
I have a small doubt.

564
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,160
What is that?
- Let me check it. - Okay.

565
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,800
You can have it after that.
- You can check everything.

566
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,120
Seriously, watermelon?
- Watermelon.

567
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,200
That's why it was so heavy.
- I'm done!

568
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,720
Did you wait so long for these
two watermelons?

569
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,920
Aren't these fruits?

570
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,600
I see. All of you will have
diarrhoea tomorrow.

571
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,520
Verger, porridge.
- Porridge? - Come..

572
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,960
Roy, I thought it'd be drinks and
food. But it is watermelon. - Yes.

573
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,400
I thought the same. - You can
have it. I don't want that.

574
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,560
You idiot, this isn't an
ordinary watermelon.

575
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,720
It's a speciality from Marayur.
- So what?

576
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,640
So your..

577
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,480
There is a flashback
for this watermelon.

578
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,560
"Mix it!"

579
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,600
"Go. Mix it.."

580
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,600
"Go. Mix it.."

581
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,160
White rum.

582
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,080
Gin, Tequila and Vodka.

583
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,000
"I rap so tight.."

584
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,440
Please go inside quickly, my dear.

585
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,200
"Go. Mix it.."

586
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,840
There are four pints
of alcohol in this fruit

587
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,160
which was inside
the refrigerator for three days.

588
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,160
That is, two full bottles.

589
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,120
Cheers.
- Cheers. - Cheers.

590
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,160
Cheers.

591
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,760
It's too good.
- It's really tasty, Roy.

592
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,320
Cheers.

593
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,080
I can't walk. Let me walk.

594
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,360
Oh, Jesus.

595
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,240
Slowly.

596
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,680
It will help me to walk.
- Let me reach first.

597
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,440
Where are the steps?
- Oh, Jesus.

598
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,520
Stop there.

599
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,640
Take it.
- "We can be a good Samaritan.."

600
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,880
That's not what I meant to do.

601
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,600
"Jesus will always be with me.."

602
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,760
You didn't come for the holy mass.
- We were having fruits.

603
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,080
You stink! - Like you're
here because you drink Horlicks.

604
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,040
Get lost.

605
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,000
'The elixir for the liver.'

606
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,560
'My fingers have started to talk.'

607
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,880
Roy.

608
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,480
What is it, dear?

609
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,400
This was a mistake.
- No.

610
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,040
I've never made a mistake
in mixing. - No.

611
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,960
That's right.

612
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,880
We are sinners.

613
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,160
We have made a mistake.

614
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,320
No. Everyone makes mistakes,
my dear.

615
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,640
Have you heard about
the first sin? - I have seen it.
616
00:37:00:600 --> 00:37:01:960
I saw it five times
in Ajantha Theatre.

616
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,600
Once, Satan disguised himself as
a snake and gave them fruits

617
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,080
to make them commit the first sin.
- Really?

618
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,360
Here, we've become snakes
after having the fruits.

619
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,840
Both are the same.

620
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,080
I want to confess.
- By the by..

621
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,080
Who doesn't give in to temptation?

622
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,520
Yes. People will fall. People
should fall. They must fall.

623
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,800
Roy.
- Oh, no. - They are falling down.

624
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,320
Oh, no.
- We are falling down.

625
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,240
Father Keerikkadan is down.

626
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,160
Get out.
- Oh, no.

627
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,200
Watch out.
- Oh, no.

628
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,640
Oh, no.

629
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,520
Hey.. Go.

630
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,720
Get lost, Bengali.
- Get lost.

631
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,120
Oh, no. He was a Keralite.
- Damn.

632
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,640
Fools! It's not a crime that
we broke a cup and saucer.

633
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,080
That was not a cup and a saucer.

634
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,920
It's the holy wine and Eucharist.

635
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,640
Thank God they didn't kill us.

636
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,440
At last, people who committed the
crime became sinners, didn't they?

637
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,080
What will we do now?

638
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,960
There's no point in living if our
family comes to know of it.

639
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,040
There are 12 days left
for the wedding.

640
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,240
What to do? - Aren't you healthy?
Can't you die?

641
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,160
You can die.

642
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,680
Roy. - Oh, no.
- Roy. - Yes.

643
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,360
God has gifted us 12 days where
nobody will search for us.

644
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,520
What?
- Come.

645
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,320
How about we have some fun?

646
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,280
We shall!

647
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,200
What?

648
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,400
For the next 12 days

649
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,880
we will have fun
like you never had before

650
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,480
together.

651
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,160
What do you call it?
Extreme happiness.

652
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,640
We will pace towards it.

653
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,840
Hey.

654
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,720
Hey, Paul. It's me.

655
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,800
Can you lend me your car
for a couple of days?

656
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,520
Extreme of happiness.

657
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,800
What will that be?
- But one condition.

658
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,280
What? - This will happen
only until New year.

659
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,120
We will put an end to it after
celebrating the new year. - Damn.

660
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,520
Damn. - We will go back home
as good sons

661
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,360
and celebrate Tony's wedding.
Do you agree?

662
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,560
Yes.
- Yes.

663
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,880
"Give us imaginary wings
to fly like birds."

664
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,920
"Let the sky be a boundary
to immerse in ecstasy."

665
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,960
"I want to see the
angels in the cold night."

666
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:55,080
"I want to sing the melodious sweet
symphony flowing from their lips."
667
00:40:06:440 --> 00:40:07:240
Give it to me.

667
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,360
Please give.
- Take this.

668
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,560
Drinks are here.
- One second.

669
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,880
Little bit of vodka.
- Vodka? - Nice.

670
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,680
And mix it.

671
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,560
Mixing.

672
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,720
Hey, no!
That's for me, man.

673
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,040
Cheers. - Cheers.
- Cheers. - Cheers.

674
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,720
Tony.
- Nice.

675
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,840
You will be getting married
after this trip.

676
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,440
Do you've experience in anything
other than drinking?

677
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,840
Your driving skills..
- What do you mean?

678
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,160
Thoomba..
- Thumba.

679
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,160
How do you feel about
rocket launch at Thumba?

680
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,960
What do you mean?

681
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,240
It means..

682
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,440
Roy!
- What?

683
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,080
Tony doesn't know how to drive.

684
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,400
What?

685
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,720
He doesn't know anything.
- Hey!

686
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,400
Is this how you should
talk to your elders?

687
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,360
Do you know how to drive?

688
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,640
I have steering balance.

689
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,200
What about you?

690
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,600
I have passed the driving test.
- Oh, God!

691
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,600
They have grown up.

692
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,080
Tony.
- Yes. - Come here.

693
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,880
Yes.

694
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,640
Are you a virgin?

695
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,520
Well..
Sort of..

696
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,440
Which is this place?

697
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,000
Let me ask google.
One minute. - Can I take a sip?

698
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,760
Kambi.

699
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,480
Kambam, Theni.

700
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,880
Kambam, Theni, Bodimettu,
Andipatti, Chakarapatti.

701
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,400
There is a driving school
somewhere here.

702
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,880
Saroja's driving school is here.

703
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,040
Look,
the holy lamp is lit.

704
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,320
This is a good family.
Let's leave.

705
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,280
Come here.

706
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,480
Two wicks mean

707
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,560
there are two drivers in there.

708
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,440
This is a symbol.

709
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,680
Symbol.

710
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,800
Why don't they change the bell?

711
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,440
Who is it? - It's me.
- Mr. Roy!

712
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,240
Come in.
One, two, three.

713
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,760
Come in, mister.
- Mister!

714
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,120
It's not how they use
'mister' in Kerala.

715
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,200
It's got a good meaning here.

716
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,960
Understood?
Come on.

717
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,480
This decent guy
can live anywhere.

718
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,040
Come on. - He's great.
- She is praying.

719
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,120
Ma'am.
- Who is it?

720
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,600
Roy darling!

721
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,480
Come here.

722
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,880
Are you reading the Bhagavad Gita?

723
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,640
'Kissing on the face
and the lips induce'

724
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,320
'lust..'
- Lust?

725
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,080
Kama Sutra!

726
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,560
Vatsyayana!

727
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,520
Oh, my!

728
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,720
Ma'am, there were two wicks
on the lamp outside.

729
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,520
We used to have 5-8 wicks
in a lamp.

730
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,160
Good old times!

731
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,120
It's gone now!

732
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,440
Lamp..

733
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,840
One, two, three, four.

734
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,320
Fours wicks.

735
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,800
One, two, three, four.

736
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,840
What a beautiful ritual!

737
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,280
The lamps are still lit because
of gentlemen like Roy.

738
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,240
My dear!

739
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,280
Is she all right?

740
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,520
Is she okay?

741
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,960
What can I say..

742
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,240
Right?

743
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,400
Do as you wish.

744
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,200
Go on.
- Tony.

745
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,160
Sorry.
- Get Roy's blessing.

746
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,040
Good.

747
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,120
Leg. - Get it.
- All the best!

748
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,480
Tony.

749
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,120
Get her blessing.

750
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,560
Touch her feet.

751
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,480
Do your best, dear.

752
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,360
He will, won't you?

753
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,640
Roy.

754
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,520
Yes. - Is this his first time?
- Yes.

755
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,280
Dear, give him
the decorated bed!

756
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,400
God, my hands are shaking.

757
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,320
No, Tony.
The manhood..

758
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,240
My name is Tony.

759
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,680
Can I touch you?

760
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,000
Tony.

761
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,240
Take a

762
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,440
deep breath.

763
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,080
What is your name?

764
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,080
What happened?

765
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,840
Oh, no!
What..

766
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,720
Sorry, miss!
- Get lost! - Malayali!

767
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,080
Roy!

768
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,360
Run!

769
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,080
Come on.
- What?

770
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,040
What is it?
Are you done?

771
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,240
Roy, give me the money.
- Don't go.

772
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,600
Here you go.

773
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,480
Get in the car.
Run.

774
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,520
What did you do?
- Come fast.
775
00:46:03:480 --> 00:46:05:08
Did you crush her?

775
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,720
Shut up!

776
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,080
God,
what is going to happen now?

777
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,280
"Baby."

778
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,040
"Baby."

779
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,960
"Baby."

780
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,840
"Baby."
784
00:47:20:680 --> 00:47:22:04
Hey, let's go.

781
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,840
Yes.
- Come on.

782
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,040
No one is here.

783
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,640
Bag.

784
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,960
Come on.

785
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,280
Shall we?

786
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,480
Yes.

787
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,280
"Ecstasy of joy is overflowing
like honey"

788
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,120
"in your dreams."

789
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,520
"The paradise you search for"

790
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,800
"is the world around you."

791
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,720
"Come and drench in the
euphoria of the ecstasy."

792
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,040
"Colourful dreams are blooming
in our eyes."

793
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,560
"The colours are released
with the words and smiles."

794
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:29,760
"Give us imaginary wings
to fly like birds."

795
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:36,640
"Let the sky be a boundary
to get immersed in ecstasy."
796
00:49:41:440 --> 00:49:42:640
One vodka shot.

796
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,960
And wine..
- Red wine. - One glass.

797
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,320
Here you go!
- What is this?

798
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,240
I was calling Jessica..

799
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,440
He calls Jessica
whenever he drinks.

800
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,160
Love!
Roy, take the phone.
801
00:50:14:880 --> 00:50:15:680
Hey.

801
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,920
What's it?

802
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,520
I am sorry.
Why are you staring?

803
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,520
Shall we dance?

804
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,360
Come on.
Dance with me.

805
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,760
Come.
- Leave me.

806
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,480
She hit him without realising
what they're capable of.

807
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,040
Come.

808
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,160
Catch her!

809
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,600
This area is under his control.

810
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,200
They will be killed.
- Move.

811
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,720
Stop it!

812
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,960
Let go!
Leave me!

813
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,120
Don't!

814
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,120
Stay aside.
- Roy.

815
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,160
What is it?

816
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,280
Look. That is cruel.

817
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,600
Don't bother.

818
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,040
Leave me, rascal.

819
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,320
Mr. PC Thomas won't tolerate it.
How dare he hurt a lady.. - Stop.

820
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,600
Listen.
- What is he up to?

821
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:16,960
Leave me!

822
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,480
Oh, no!
- So, that is done!

823
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,800
Hey, come. Let's go.
- Tony.

824
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:23,960
They are immature!

825
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,800
Show them our power.
Stop!

826
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,320
Your moustache.

827
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,160
Move.
828
00:52:12:80 --> 00:52:13:640
Reetha.

828
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:18,880
Get lost!

829
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,480
Come.

830
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,800
Let's go!

831
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,560
Come with me.
- My bike.

832
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:46,880
Let's go.

833
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,560
Come fast. - Shit!
Get in.

834
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,240
My bike.

835
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,760
That's burning. Buy another one.
Move. - Leave my hand.

836
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,920
You are fine.
Aren't you?

837
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,320
Mr. Roy, move.

838
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,600
We must rescue them.
- Why?

839
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:02,960
Poor girls!

840
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,760
Where the hell are they?

841
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,360
Girls, don't worry.
I am here for you.

842
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,840
Come on, boys.

843
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,880
I taught them to fight.

844
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,360
Get in.
- Hurry up! - Come.

845
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,240
Start the vehicle.

846
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,080
The alcohol we drank
went in vain.

847
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,200
Hello. - What?
- Nothing.

848
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,280
Roy..
- Tony.

849
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,840
This is our last new year
before your wedding.

850
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,960
We'll ruin it if we take up
unnecessary responsibilities.

851
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,680
But how can we leave them alone?
- They had a problem. We solved it.

852
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,680
That should end there.

853
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,600
We needn't take the
responsibility.. - Excuse me.

854
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,680
Thank you for saving us
from them.

855
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,680
But you needn't act
as our protectors.

856
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,120
God asked me to rescue you,
and I obeyed.

857
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,000
Now, He asks me to drop you safely
at your destination.

858
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,400
I will drop you for sure.

859
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,640
You want to go Yercaud. Right?
- Yes. - I will.

860
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,920
No worries. Drop us
where we can find vehicles.

861
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,320
We will go on our own.

862
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,760
No. Why would you?

863
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,600
Aren't you going to Yercaud?
We are also on the way to Yercaud.

864
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,600
What a coincidence!
- Aby.

865
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,760
Yes.
They are staying in the same hotel.

866
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,640
Prayaga is alone.
Accompany her.

867
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,040
Go on.

868
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,720
Her hair style is nice.

869
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,720
But.. Yercaud is very far.

870
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,480
Keep quiet.
I like her a lot.

871
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,600
What?
- It's love at first sight.

872
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,960
Please.
I don't want to lose her. - Okay.

873
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,480
We can celebrate the new year
at Yercaud.

874
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,880
Of course!
- Isn't it a good idea?

875
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,400
'Yercaud.
8:45 a.m.'

876
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,880
Hello.
Welcome, ma'am.

877
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,680
Hey. We are Rita and Prayaga
from Kerala.

878
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,840
Yes, ma'am. Your room is ready.
- Okay.

879
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,200
Can you arrange a car tomorrow
at sharp 9 a.m.? - Yes.

880
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,560
To the railway station.
- Sure, ma'am.

881
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,720
Come, ma'am.
- Hello!

882
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,920
What is this? Do you know how long
my wife and I have been waiting?

883
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,720
Sorry, sir. Give me five minutes.
I will get your room ready.
884
00:56:00:080 --> 00:56:00:880
Please come, ma'am.

884
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:05,360
It's just the two of us.
Why are they taking so much time?

885
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,480
Here's your key, ma'am.
- Thanks. - Welcome.

886
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,720
What about their rooms?
- They will manage it.

887
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,520
Excuse me.
Prayaga..

888
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,880
Did you..
Did you get the room?

889
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,360
Yes.

890
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,720
Your room number, please.
- Stop flirting!

891
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,200
It's 501.

892
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,240
Only one room is left, sir.
- Only one?

893
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,760
There's only one room.
- It's okay. - Okay.

894
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,720
Roy doesn't need a separate room.
A partition will do.

895
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,480
Stop it.
- Of course.

896
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,840
There's only one room left.
- That will do.

897
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,200
Excuse me, sir.

898
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,480
Sir. - Yes. - New Year's Eve
celebrations will start at 8 p.m.

899
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,600
It's complimentary.
Please come.

900
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,120
I will.
- Sure.

901
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,200
We can't miss it.

902
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,040
But you must force us to drink.
- Sure.

903
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,560
"New year party!"

904
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,440
"Grab a glass to see the chief!"

905
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,600
"Let's go.
Rock the night!"

906
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,080
"Look at the work of
the love in the air!"

907
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:20,680
"We are like nightingales
singing melodiously at night."

908
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:27,480
"Let's sing together
for a bright tomorrow."

909
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,280
"That's the move of a mastermind."

910
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,840
"Go, live before
we're caught alive."

911
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,440
"So what? It'll pass the time."

912
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,280
"And do you believe?
It's a new year's eve!"

913
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,560
"Every time I see you shine, I must
say girl you look good right now!"

914
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,080
"Madness! The spirits die!"

915
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,760
"And do you believe?
It's a new year's eve!"

916
00:57:54,120 --> 00:58:00,520
"Like the flowers that wilt..
Like the leaves that fall off.."

917
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:06,960
"Days pass by
and a new dawn awakes."

918
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:13,840
"Let's forget every sorrow
and celebrate in joy."

919
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:20,080
"Let's forget every sorrow
and celebrate in joy."

920
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,560
"Let's roll from nine to five! Go,
live before we're caught alive!"

921
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,960
"So what?
It'll pass the time"

922
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,880
"And if you believe
on a new year's eve!"

923
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,480
"Every time I see you shine"

924
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,280
"I must say girl you
look good right now!"

925
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,640
"Madness! The spirits die!"

926
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,400
"And do you believe?
It's a new year's eve!"

927
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,240
"It's the new year party!"

928
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,760
"Grab a glass to see the chief!"

929
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,960
"Let's go.
Rock the night!"

930
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,400
"Look at the work of
the love in the air!"

931
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,200
Where?
At the minister's hotel? Okay.

932
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,160
Connect to Mr. Karthik's landline.
- Okay, sir.

933
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,080
Hello. Police control room.

934
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,520
Tell me.
- Okay. - Yes.

935
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,040
Mr. Karthik's numbers
are switched off.

936
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,280
His landline
is unreachable.

937
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,440
Really?
Come.

938
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,120
Come on! Fast!
Quick.

939
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,560
Get in.
Start the vehicle.
940
01:00:12:600 --> 01:00:14:160
Karthik is praying inside.

940
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,800
"Oh, Lord Shiva.."

941
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,000
"Oh, Lord Shiva.."

942
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,240
Four men and two women, sir.

943
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,240
Any relationship between them?
- No, sir.

944
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,680
How much time will it take from
here to there? - Half an hour, sir.

945
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,280
"Oh, Lord Shiva.."

946
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,360
"Oh, Lord Shiva.."

947
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,880
Sir, they are Keralites. They
booked the room yesterday morning.

948
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,280
Sir, there explanations are very
strange.

949
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,320
Move aside. - Yes.
- Sir.
950
01:02:17:720 --> 01:02:21:12
"Oh, Lord Shiva.."

950
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,760
"Oh, Lord Shiva.."
951
01:03:25:960 --> 01:03:29:600
"Oh, Lord Shiva.."

951
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,680
"Oh, Lord Shiva.."
952
01:04:03:800 --> 01:04:05:840
No. Sit here. Don't get down.

952
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,240
I will go and take a look.
- Okay.

953
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,720
Fernandez.
- Hey, Aravindan.

954
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,280
How did you come here?

955
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,560
Dear, where is Reetha?
- Dad.

956
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,960
Mom.
- Why is she crying, Malini?

957
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,000
What happened to Reetha?

958
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,040
What happened?
- Come with me. Come.

959
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,440
Aravindan, what happened
to my daughter?

960
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,200
Come on.
961
01:05:05:52 --> 01:05:06:960
W-What happened to my daughter?

961
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,680
How did she come here?

962
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,360
Aravindan,
tell me what happened to her.

963
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,320
Reetha.

964
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:17,760
Did you fall down?

965
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:24,040
Hey, s-she said she would come and
take her m-mom for dialysis.

966
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,520
Fernandez.
- Why is she..

967
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,760
Why is she lying like a corpse?
Can't she hear me?

968
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,440
Reetha.
- Hey.. - Dear.

969
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,920
Fernandez.
- Why are you silent?

970
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,560
Hey.
- Reetha.

971
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,720
Hey, move aside.

972
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:36,960
Daughter!

973
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,480
Mom is..
- Fernandez.

974
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,960
Mom.. Your mom is in the car.

975
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,720
Aravindan, she shouldn't see her..

976
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,400
She won't be able to bear it.
Move aside. - Fernandez.

977
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,200
I don't understand why she
travelled this far to come here.

978
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,040
Fernandez.
- Dear.

979
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,160
Why did you come here?

980
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:01,040
Tell me,
how did you guys come this far?

981
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,720
Tell me why you came here.

982
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,680
Come, dear.
- Aravindan.

983
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:06,920
Tell me.

984
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:10,560
How did you come here?
Why did you come here?

985
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,440
Tell me what happened to her?

986
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,040
What?
Nothing happened..

987
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,840
She is getting ready to come
with us.

988
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,800
She asked you to wait in the car.
Come on.

989
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,160
It's so hot.

990
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,760
Sit inside. - Okay.
- Get in.

991
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:39,560
"Oh, Lord Shiva.."

992
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:43,360
"Oh, Lord Shiva.."

993
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,440
Aravindan, Aleena's dialysis
can't be postponed.

994
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,600
I will take her..
Wait a minute.

995
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,680
Sir, I am Reetha's father.

996
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,560
Please come in. Come on.
- Come in.

997
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:53,760
Come on. Sit down.

998
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,240
Sir, I am Fernandez.
I am a retired naval officer.

999
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,840
I don't know how she came here,
sir.
1000
01:07:00:520 --> 01:07:01:720
I don't know what happened.

1000
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,480
There will be many legal
formalities, right?

1001
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,520
I need to take her
corpse to Kerala.

1002
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,960
I will.. I will go early, sir.
- Okay.

1003
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:23,040
I need to take my w-wife
for her dialysis, sir.

1004
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:29,080
I-I just had o-one daughter, sir.

1005
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,960
I want a printout of the details
of all the guests.

1006
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,120
Nobody should go anywhere without
the permission of the police.
1007
01:08:00:440 --> 01:08:03:640
Rafi, what happened? - The place
is surrounded by the police, Roy.

1007
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,640
Apparently,
this is a minister's hotel.

1008
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,080
I don't think we can get out
of here, Roy.

1009
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,200
We are trapped.

1010
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,600
Damn. - Roy.
- Yes.

1011
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,280
Why don't we disclose everything?

1012
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,120
We will be in prison
if we do that.

1013
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:23,880
What can we do..
- Tony.

1014
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,120
You should tell the police
what I tell you.

1015
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,360
We need to leave from here.

1016
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,240
Isn't his wedding
in four days?

1017
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,400
It should happen.

1018
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,160
Prathap.
- Sir.

1019
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:50,040
I want the full footage of the CCTV
camera. Don't miss anything.

1020
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:51,080
Sir.
- What?

1021
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,920
The CCTV camera on the fifth floor
where Reetha and Prayaga stayed

1022
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,920
had been obstructed after 2 a.m.

1023
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,200
Someone has masked it purposefully.
1024
01:09:03:960 --> 01:09:04:760
Sir, it's here.

1024
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,440
It seems like a planned attempt.

1025
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,200
"Oh, Lord Shiva!"

1026
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:37,320
"Oh, Lord Shiva!"

1027
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:59,720
Roy, Tony, Aby, Rafi.
1028
01:10:00:960 --> 01:10:02:080
Happy new year, guys!

1028
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,080
Oh, I guess
it's not a happy new year.

1029
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:06,760
Sit down.

1030
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,200
"Lord Shiva.."

1031
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,440
Sir, we slept at around 1 a.m.,
sir.

1032
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,040
We came to know
about it in the morning.

1033
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,800
We woke up hearing the commotion.

1034
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,840
Sir, we were hung-over after the
New Year's Eve celebrations. - Hey!

1035
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,880
You started talking even before I
asked you any questions. Okay.

1036
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,400
Excuse me.

1037
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,120
Sir.

1038
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,520
She was drunk.

1039
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:00,040
So, she might have slipped and that
would have caused the fall.

1040
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,680
It's murder.

1041
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,320
What happened to your hand, Roy?

1042
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,240
Sir?

1043
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,360
Your hand.
- What?

1044
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,400
This.. I cut myself when a bottle
broke during the party.

1045
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,640
A bottle? - Yes. - You should be
careful since you got cut by glass.

1046
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,280
You should be administered
a TT injection.

1047
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,240
Also, your body language would make

1048
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,600
any policeman dubious.

1049
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,280
So, even I am dubious.

1050
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:37,520
And so, there is a small change in
your programme.

1051
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,320
You are not allowed to leave this
place without my permission.

1052
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,240
Okay?

1053
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,320
Police!

1054
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:52,360
Advocate, suggest me an idea
to get out this mess.

1055
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,880
Jeez!
The police are here as well!

1056
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,720
Let me make something very clear.

1057
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,280
You'd also
end up in trouble if I do.

1058
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,440
Listen. I have an idea.

1059
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:01,800
What if I run away from this place?

1060
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,520
They'll catch you
if you try to run away.

1061
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,480
The commissioner is dangerous.

1062
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,120
He has solved every single case

1063
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,520
which he's investigated.

1064
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:09,960
It's just a matter of ten days.

1065
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,240
He will file the final report
in that period of time.

1066
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,120
He will adopt
any method to solve the case.

1067
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:21,920
Method? Stop praising him
and help me get out of this mess.

1068
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,360
Devise a clever plan

1069
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,480
to escape from that place.

1070
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,280
How on earth can I! Whatever.
Hang up the call.

1071
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,640
Useless advocate!

1072
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,160
Oh, God! The cops are everywhere!
- Did they make reservations

1073
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:36,000
or did they just check in? - They'd
made a reservation for one room.

1074
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,600
What? Yes.
- Sir.

1075
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,320
Hey. - What?
- Jeez!

1076
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,120
Hey..
- What?

1077
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,400
No.

1078
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,800
The policeman.
- Me?

1079
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,960
What?
- Nothing. - What?

1080
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,200
Are you a Malayali?
- What if I am?

1081
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,280
Could you come to my room?
- Pig! I'm not that kind of a guy!

1082
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,200
Find someone else!
- That's not what I meant.

1083
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,080
Then?
- I want to show you something.

1084
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,400
I will show it now.

1085
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,600
Please come.
I'll show it.

1086
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,080
I hope he sees her.

1087
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,480
Hey..

1088
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,040
Stand up.
Look who is here.

1089
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,960
Please come.
Welcome.

1090
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,720
Please sit.. - Stop pretending
to be nice and tell me what it is.

1091
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,360
Would you like tea or coffee?
- Tell me what it is!

1092
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:24,960
Oh, God!

1093
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,440
Hey!
- Help me, sir!

1094
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,400
I lied to my wife that I was going
on a business tour!

1095
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,800
Please forgive me, sir.
Oh, God!

1096
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,320
If she comes to know of this,
she'll hire goons to thrash me!

1097
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:39,680
Damn!

1098
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,640
I don't have anything, sir!

1099
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,200
My wife wears
the pants in our family!

1100
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,400
Take her with you if you want to.
She'll take good care of you!

1101
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,080
Sir. - Hey!
You swine! Stand up.

1102
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,440
Hello.
- Move.

1103
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,360
What? - You may go after giving
your number. - Okay, sir.

1104
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,640
Prayaga
is the prime witness in the case.

1105
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,600
Prayaga isn't in the right state of
mind for us to question her.

1106
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,920
We want her to be with us for
two days till the formalities

1107
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,400
of the case are completed.
- Hey! No!

1108
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,040
Sorry, sir. - No. - I'll make
sure that she is safe.

1109
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,120
We shall complete
the formalities soon

1110
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,320
and I'll bring her to you.
- Yes.

1111
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,160
The four of them are lying.

1112
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,480
It's a well-planned story.

1113
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,760
They go on a journey

1114
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,280
meet two women

1115
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,960
start travelling with them and one
of them gets murdered..

1116
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,720
Sir, there is a story
that connects all of them.

1117
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,160
We need to find what it is

1118
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,560
and for that, all of them
should be in our custody.

1119
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,520
But they shouldn't feel like
they are in police custody.

1120
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:57,080
To be honest,
Roy, I'm a half Malayali.

1121
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,240
My mother, Savithri, is from
Palakkad. She is a Brahmin.

1122
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,680
My father, Venkata Raman,
is a Tamil Brahmin.

1123
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,080
I've come to Cochin
to see the biennale.

1124
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,440
I like Kerala a lot.

1125
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,880
Especially the tapioca, fish curry
and fried covey that you prepare.

1126
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,960
It's anchovy.
- Yes. Anchovy.

1127
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,320
It's crunchy.

1128
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:19,160
And of course, the evergreen
Jagathi Sreekumar.

1129
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,240
But the two of them
don't match, sir.

1130
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,200
When I'm under
the strain of the case

1131
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,160
I watch his scenes.

1132
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,440
Is the case a joke to you as well?

1133
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,280
The case isn't a joke.

1134
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:33,600
Damn serious.

1135
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:42,040
Sir, where are we going?

1136
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,040
To a new place.

1137
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,280
A place that you've
never seen before.

1138
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,240
Must be prison!

1139
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:55,400
"Oh, milk-woman!
Give me some milk."

1140
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:59,640
"Come to me. Did you hear
the song I was singing for you?"

1141
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,320
"Hey, shy girl!"

1142
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,560
Is this an open prison?
- Hello.

1143
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,640
This isn't a prison
but a farmhouse.

1144
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,120
My favourite place.

1145
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,840
Come. I'll show you around.

1146
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,360
Look. It's the perfect place
for a hideout.

1147
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,800
Few rare breeds of cows.

1148
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,640
Pesticide-free vegetables and
fruits. Farming..

1149
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,800
Just a hobby. - Look how calm he is
when we have our back to the wall!

1150
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,360
Did you say something, Rafi?

1151
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,400
No..
I was saying it's a nice place.

1152
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,920
Come.
Hey, where is Nalini?

1153
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,760
At the bungalow, sir.
- Bring Nalini. - Nalini! - Okay.

1154
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,160
Nalini might be his wife.

1155
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,640
Just tell Nalini if you need
anything and it will be done. Come.

1156
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:42,640
Seriously?

1157
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,960
I am going to rock today!

1158
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:46,920
Hi.
- Greetings, sir.

1159
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,520
Nalini, come..
- Jeez! Is he Nalini?

1160
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,600
Yes. Nalinikanthan.
He is a Malayali.

1161
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:56,560
Though you gave me a hint, I didn't
expect that you'd bring four men.

1162
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,200
Prepare delicious
Kerala food for them. - Sure.

1163
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,800
He is a great cook. - I see.
- Nalini's Sambar is delicious!

1164
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,360
That reminds me of something.
Shall I crack a joke?

1165
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,160
Do you know the difference between
Sambar and Rasam? - No.

1166
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:13,400
Rasam has rasa.
But Sambar doesn't have samba.

1167
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,040
Are you done? - That was hilarious!
- Such a bad joke.

1168
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,560
Nalini. - Yes. - God!
- Take their luggage

1169
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,040
and show them their rooms.
- Sure.

1170
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,960
I have some work to do. - Okay.
I shall come at night. - Sir.

1171
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,440
Nalini. - Yes.
- Ready a room.

1172
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,520
Okay, sir,
- One more guest will be here.

1173
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,240
Come on.
- Is this a huge hill or what!

1174
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,600
Call it a Herculean hill
and me, Hercules.

1175
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,680
Consider the lady
over there as Atalanta.

1176
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,880
She is my assistant, Val..
- Valsa!

1177
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,640
Vaduthala Valsa!
- Mr. Roy!

1178
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,600
Why are you here?

1179
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,800
It's been so long since we met.

1180
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,640
I'm glad
that you still remember me.

1181
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,880
How can I forget you!

1182
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,480
I can guess
how they know each other.

1183
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,960
When did you come here?

1184
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,400
That trade
wasn't ideal for me and so

1185
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,160
I retired voluntarily.
- Good.

1186
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,840
Were you working for someone
or an entrepreneur yourself?

1187
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,360
Anyway, I never
entertained morons like you. Move!

1188
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,160
Won't you be here for a while?
- Yes.

1189
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,800
I've some work at the farm.

1190
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,160
See you.

1191
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:22,080
She is really sincere
about her work!

1192
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,080
What? - Yeah, right.
That's obvious.

1193
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,440
Come.
1194
01:19:13:800 --> 01:19:16:480
Listen. - Yes. - Keep a distance
from him though you know him.

1194
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,640
Why?
- They are wicked.

1195
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,880
When I quit something,
I quit for good.

1196
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,920
What if I request you?
- I'll consider the request.

1197
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,320
We got the post-mortem report, sir.

1198
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,360
It might have
been an attempted rape.

1199
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:40,840
A tussle has happened, sir.

1200
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,640
There are marks on her neck.

1201
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,160
As per the post-mortem report,
the death occurred

1202
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,440
between 3 a.m. and 3:30 a.m.
- Yes, sir. Exactly.
1203
01:20:00:560 --> 01:20:01:800
Can I say something, sir?

1203
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,120
Aren't we going to the farmhouse?
- Yes.

1204
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,600
Let's go to 'Lakshmi Vilasam',
the cafe and eat 'Upma'.

1205
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,200
It is delicious.

1206
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,400
Let's go.
- I'll have a Vada too.

1207
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,600
"I'm going to eat 'Upma' and Vada."

1208
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,520
This is the happiest new year
of my life.

1209
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,120
How I wish

1210
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,040
this night never ended!

1211
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,880
What if it lasted
till the end of our lives?

1212
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,960
What a philosophy!

1213
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,920
You are drunk.

1214
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,760
Go and take a shower.

1215
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:50,000
No.
- Reetha, do what I said.

1216
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,640
No.
- Go and take a bath.

1217
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:56,640
Come on.
1218
01:21:05:960 --> 01:21:06:800
Goodnight.

1218
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:07,800
Hey!

1219
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,120
I need another drink.

1220
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,720
I'll be back.
- Reetha!

1221
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,800
No, you are already drunk.

1222
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,600
Only one peg.

1223
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,000
My last peg.

1224
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,080
Go and take a bath.

1225
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,600
Hey!
Reetha.

1226
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,400
Reetha, no!

1227
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,280
Open the door, Reetha.

1228
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,200
At what time did she go out?

1229
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,560
Around 1 a.m., sir.
- Okay.

1230
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:51,200
So, the incident happened
between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m.

1231
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:55,760
Sorry, Prayaga.

1232
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,240
It's a rape attempt.
1233
01:22:17:560 --> 01:22:18:760
A tussle has happened, sir.

1233
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,880
There are strangulation marks
on her neck.

1234
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,600
Around 1 a.m., sir.

1235
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:26,400
Do you doubt anyone among the four?

1236
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,000
"Lord Shiva.."

1237
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,520
"Lord Shiva.."

1238
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,040
Roy.

1239
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:45,120
I always get a positive energy
when I am here.

1240
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:49,120
There is no better place

1241
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:52,760
to reveal the secrets
you are hiding.

1242
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:53,960
Sir.

1243
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,240
We are not hiding anything.

1244
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,920
What we said is true.
1245
01:23:02:920 --> 01:23:06:120
Your wrist got cut
during the party, right?

1245
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:07,840
Yes, sir.

1246
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,360
What you said was a lie.

1247
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,400
According to your testimony,
you went to bed at 1:30 a.m.

1248
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:27,080
But according to the report
from the cyber cell

1249
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:30,400
you had made a phone call
to 9-8-4-9-2-1-1-1-3-2

1250
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,680
from 2 a.m. to 3:30 a.m.

1251
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,240
You were talking to Jessica.

1252
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,720
So, what Roy said was a lie.

1253
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,960
What you said was a lie too.

1254
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:46,560
Of course, unless you sleep-talk.

1255
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,920
Come on, Rafi.
1256
01:24:01:600 --> 01:24:05:960
You said that you were hung-over
and slept before 1:30 a.m.

1256
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,720
But, we have proof

1257
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:13,360
that you went to the bar
at 1:45 a.m.

1258
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,440
That means, what you said is a lie.

1259
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,320
You should tell us what happened.

1260
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,840
Because on the New Year's Eve

1261
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:02,440
you went to Reetha's
and Prayaga's room.

1262
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,720
Sir, I..
- Don't lie.

1263
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:13,920
We've witnesses who saw you talking
to Reetha, in front of their room.

1264
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,960
Reetha, no!
Open the door, Reetha.

1265
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,040
Hi.

1266
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,240
What is it?

1267
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:42,400
It's nothing.

1268
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,160
I want a peg.

1269
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:47,520
Peg!

1270
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:49,760
I'll get you one.

1271
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,920
I've fixed your drink.

1272
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,400
Let's raise a toast.

1273
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:56,760
Cheers.
1274
01:26:04:28 --> 01:26:05:080
Hey.

1274
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,800
I have something to say.

1275
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:11,840
Love, isn't it?

1276
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,160
How do you know?

1277
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:17,920
What else can it be?

1278
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,800
Whenever a girl acts friendly

1279
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,320
you fall in love with her!

1280
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,400
That is not love.

1281
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:31,600
It's lust.

1282
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,440
Lust.

1283
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:35,960
Please don't misunderstand me.

1284
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,080
I am not that kind of man.

1285
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:41,600
Besides that,
I have feelings for Prayaga

1286
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,640
and not you.

1287
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,200
Great!

1288
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:49,600
You must help us, please.
- Aby.

1289
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,880
No one loves anyone in this world.

1290
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,840
We all love only ourselves.

1291
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,960
Selfish moron.
- Do you have to preach tonight?

1292
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:01,080
I will listen to you tomorrow.
- Get lost.

1293
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:04,280
Who knows who all
will be there tomorrow?

1294
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,400
Are you sure you will be here?

1295
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,160
I won't be here.

1296
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,360
Sure.

1297
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,480
You are drunk.

1298
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,160
Go and sleep.

1299
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,320
Get lost.

1300
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,280
One last night to stay awake.

1301
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:27,000
Last sleepless night.

1302
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,520
The last night.

1303
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:34,560
Are you saying
that this is a suicide?

1304
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,560
I felt so.

1305
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,080
But, Aby

1306
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,720
we don't think so.

1307
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,960
If you investigate
suicide cases diligently

1308
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,560
they might become murders.

1309
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:53,840
Some politicians manipulate
like you.
1310
01:28:01:760 --> 01:28:04:760
"Lord Shiva.."

1310
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,720
"Lord Shiva.."

1311
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,920
"Lord Shiva.."

1312
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,800
"Lord Shiva.."

1313
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,120
There it is.

1314
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:28,120
There is no cut on your wrist
after the new year party.

1315
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,480
Then when did you get hurt?

1316
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:38,480
I thought it happened
during the party.

1317
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,480
You now realise that it didn't
happen during the party.

1318
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,240
You can remember it if you try.

1319
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:47,600
I was so drunk that night.

1320
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:51,160
So, I am not able to recall
what happened that night.

1321
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:54,360
Shall I show you something
that might help you remember?
1322
01:29:13:480 --> 01:29:14:720
You forgot when you got hurt.

1322
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,480
But you remembered to dress it.

1323
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,480
What kind of forgetfulness is this?

1324
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,640
Do you have to get shocked
when a phone rings?

1325
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,240
Attend the call.

1326
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:33,800
No, it's okay.
- Attend it.

1327
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:38,560
Hello, Aunt.

1328
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,840
Roy, I am at the retreat centre.

1329
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,000
Are you not here?

1330
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,320
Well..
We left that place.

1331
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,720
We are at a retreat centre
in Tamil Nadu.

1332
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,720
In Tamil Nadu?
- Yes, Aunt.

1333
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,320
This is a better place.

1334
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:55,920
The father who runs this place
is my acquaintance.

1335
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,120
Are you in trouble?

1336
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:00,440
No, Aunt.

1337
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,360
I'll bring them
and reach there for the wedding.

1338
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,640
Okay.
- Where is Tony? - I..

1339
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,400
Roy.

1340
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,040
Greetings to you.
- Excuse me? Oh, yes.

1341
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:17,360
I am Father Gilbert.
- I am Eliyamma, Tony's mother.

1342
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,800
I am the priest
who runs this retreat.

1343
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,720
Praise the Lord.

1344
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,720
For now and forever.

1345
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,960
The four of them
are doing their prayers now.

1346
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,880
All what's remaining
is a confession.

1347
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:35,160
Everything will be fine after that.

1348
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:36,960
Come with me, Roy.

1349
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,960
How much will you give me
if I save you from this case?

1350
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:42,800
Sir..

1351
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,480
How much will you give me
if I save you from this case?

1352
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,320
There's no time to think,
I need a quick answer.

1353
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,240
I.. Eight..

1354
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:57,680
Fifty Lakhs.

1355
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:01,200
Are you sure?
- Sir.

1356
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:06,280
I can be sure of something
since you are

1357
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,520
ready to spend a huge sum of money.

1358
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,240
One among you
has committed this murder.

1359
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:13,080
Thank you.

1360
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,480
Room number? - How dare you ask
me my room number..

1361
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,520
Hey. - ...you asshole!
- What are you..

1362
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,880
Take your hands off me!
- Excuse me? - What the..

1363
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,320
Bastard! - Get here!
- Excuse me? - Don't..

1364
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,120
Hey, stop it! - I'll shoot you!
- Don't.. - You fucker!

1365
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:35,400
She's a martial artist!
- Fuck off!

1366
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:37,280
How dare she?
- Don't you dare mess with me!

1367
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,360
Reetha, I'll.. - I will kill you!
Get lost, you moron!

1368
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,280
This is a new twist to the story.

1369
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,000
Can you recognise them, Rafi?

1370
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,160
Yes. I can recognise them
even if it's dark.

1371
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,800
Would we have to
wait until it's dark?

1372
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,560
I mean I can recognise anytime.
- That's what he meant, sir.

1373
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:57,160
Well..
1374
01:32:04:800 --> 01:32:05:640
That's them, sir.

1374
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:22,680
Come on.
- Sir.

1375
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,480
Sir, the room was taken
in the names of Muthu and Mari.

1376
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,480
The address is at Tirunelveli.

1377
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,320
They left at 5'o clock
without vacating the room

1378
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:32,160
before the
police arrived.

1379
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:34,240
Okay.

1380
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,320
Sir, we have got information from
the Tirunelveli police station.

1381
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,360
The address given there is fake.

1382
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:47,440
They are our way out
from this mess.

1383
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:51,320
We'll be able to escape
if we find them.

1384
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,960
Roy, how are we going to escape?

1385
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,120
They don't look like decent men.

1386
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:00,560
Let's leave by the time
the police question them.

1387
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:02,840
Tony's wedding should take place.

1388
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:05,680
We can take care of the rest later.

1389
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,960
I know what must be done
once we are out of here.

1390
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:12,120
Let me first meet Valsa.
- Excuse me?

1391
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,320
Seriously?
- Valsa?

1392
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:17,600
There he goes to meet Valsa!

1393
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,400
Right when we are in trouble!

1394
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:24,280
Mr. Roy, I am a poor soul

1395
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:25,880
who doesn't want
to hurt anybody.

1396
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,400
That's Valsa?
- That's why

1397
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,160
I co-operated to others' needs.

1398
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,800
Poor girl!
- Don't make me lose control.

1399
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:35,960
I am not here for that.
- Then?

1400
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,520
I need you to phone Sembakakka.
- What for?

1401
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:42,960
Just call her.
- Sembakakka? Who is that?

1402
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:46,840
"The water is so cold."

1403
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:52,760
"The water is so cold."

1404
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:56,360
"The breeze is cold too."

1405
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,960
Ma'am, you have a phone call.
- Who is it?

1406
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,600
It's Valsa from Kerala.

1407
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,480
She has taken voluntary retirement.

1408
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:09,400
My dear? How are you, dear?
- I'm good.

1409
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:12,920
Roy is with me.
I'll put him on the line. - Roy?

1410
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:15,160
Yes. Our old client.

1411
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:18,640
Greetings, sir. - I have sent you
a photograph on WhatsApp.

1412
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,720
Let me know if you recognise him.

1413
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,800
I want to know who he is.
- Okay.

1414
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,120
Kanakam. - Yes.
- Turn on the Wi-Fi.

1415
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:31,560
We get free Wi-Fi there.
That's the advantage of that place.

1416
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:35,120
She knows everyone in that place.

1417
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,840
That's how it is there.

1418
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:41,960
Hello, beautiful.

1419
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:47,800
Did you call us?
- Come.

1420
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,200
Let's take a selfie?
- Sure.

1421
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:56,160
This one is fine, right?
- Yes.

1422
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,480
You are intelligent, Roy.

1423
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:01,040
We must get them
here at the earliest.

1424
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,240
Tony and I will get them here.
- We'll come too.

1425
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,160
No. Manage the things here.

1426
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,360
Get lost!
- Oh, God!

1427
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:52,960
Beat him up!

1428
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:55,480
Go!
1429
01:36:45:560 --> 01:36:48:240
Here are the culprits
you are looking for.

1429
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,080
Iqbal and his friends
had almost reached the border.

1430
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,040
It's me who called them back.

1431
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:57,960
I was sure that you would
only return with them.

1432
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,160
Though you aren't a hero to me

1433
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:02,680
you are their hero.

1434
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,800
They are the criminals
wanted by the police.

1435
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:10,760
But they aren't the culprits
in Reetha's murder case.

1436
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:20,080
The victim in their case
is different.

1437
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:21,280
Iqbal!

1438
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:24,960
Come.

1439
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,800
Isn't that him?

1440
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:39,040
This is Lakshmana.

1441
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,680
The managing director
of Sridevi Group of Companies.

1442
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:45,320
The girl who had accompanied him
at the hotel that day

1443
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:48,400
was a friend of Muthu and Mari.

1444
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:52,600
Their plan was to blackmail them.

1445
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:56,640
There is only one room.
- That's okay. - Okay.
1446
01:38:10:840 --> 01:38:14:920
"Oh, my dear, hug me."

1446
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:16,840
Leave.
- No.

1447
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,880
Here.
- Oh, God!

1448
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:22,080
How is it?
Do you like it?

1449
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:29,720
Produce them before the magistrate.
- Sir.

1450
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:31,040
Go.

1451
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,760
We've been frustrated
for the last few days.

1452
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:36,320
Can you show us the video clip

1453
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:37,720
for some fun?

1454
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:41,480
No, dear. You won't bear it.
- Is it? Okay.

1455
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,440
Roy.

1456
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:52,440
There's no way to escape, Roy.
1457
01:39:02:200 --> 01:39:04:280
Sir, the case is
getting complicated.

1457
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,640
Sir, I doubt Aby.

1458
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,360
You may doubt whomever you want to.

1459
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:10,320
But we need evidence.

1460
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:13,600
Iqbal.
- Sir.

1461
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,680
Shall we go to Kerala?
- Sure, sir.

1462
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:27,080
Stop the car!

1463
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:30,200
Stop!
Follow it. Come on!

1464
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,520
You bloody!

1465
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,280
Hey!
1466
01:40:00:520 --> 01:40:02:160
Arrest her!
- How dare you?

1466
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:03,880
You..

1467
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:11,120
Give it here!

1468
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,280
Sir, it was on July 21st.
I remember it well.

1469
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,720
I want a copy of that F.I.R.

1470
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,640
The case was not charged, sir.

1471
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:30,680
Under the influence of alcohol,
she hit a police officer on duty.

1472
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:34,160
You offered bribe
and closed the case.

1473
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:35,960
Isn't it wrong, Mr. Fernandez?

1474
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:39,160
It is wrong from the point of view
of a naval officer.

1475
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:44,640
But I did something that any father
would do, to save his daughter.

1476
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:47,360
Though you settled the case
it remains a criminal offence.

1477
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:52,560
Sir, please don't label my daughter
as a criminal on the basis

1478
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,040
of a mistake she made.

1479
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:58,400
Things will be easier for you now.

1480
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,960
To hell with your bloody police
narration..

1481
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,240
Mind your words, Mr. Fernandez!

1482
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:03,600
Sir, please.

1483
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:06,560
My wife is inside and she is sick.

1484
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:10,480
It's her, sir.

1485
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:12,880
Excuse me for a minute.
I am sorry.

1486
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,160
I am sorry.

1487
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:37,680
This is her only way to express
her anger and grief.

1488
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:41,120
She will throw things.

1489
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:44,640
She hasn't spoken a word
after our daughter's death.

1490
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,160
She can only move a hand.

1491
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,760
I am sorry.
- It's okay.

1492
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,160
You are bound to do your duty.
I understand that.

1493
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:55,120
You can continue
with your questions.

1494
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:58,680
We got it from Reetha.
1495
01:42:01:440 --> 01:42:04:240
Sir, this is my pistol.
It is a licensed one.

1495
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:05,240
We have verified it.

1496
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:10,280
What problems did she have
to carry a pistol?

1497
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,640
Sir, I don't know.
I don't know anything.

1498
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:16,320
I didn't even know
that she had taken it from me.

1499
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:18,880
I want to check Reetha's room.

1500
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:20,640
Sure, sir. Please come.

1501
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:21,920
Come.
- Please.

1502
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,600
To us, both were our daughters.

1503
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,440
Our daughter was engaged.

1504
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:33,480
But now, it's been cancelled.

1505
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,320
We don't care about it, sir.

1506
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,640
We just want our daughter
to be happy like before.

1507
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:44,400
Don't worry.

1508
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,040
In a day or two,
Prayaga will be back.

1509
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:48,520
When was the engagement?

1510
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:56,880
Where..

1511
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,560
Where is Vinu's house?
1512
01:43:00:040 --> 01:43:00:880
Thalassery.

1512
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:07,640
The wedding is on
the day after tomorrow.

1513
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,960
We should at least leave from here
by tomorrow.

1514
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:14,200
We can't!

1515
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,280
I am destined to be mocked

1516
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:21,600
by family and society once again.

1517
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:32,240
It's Jessica.

1518
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:34,920
Attend the call.

1519
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:39,800
What do I say?
- Answer it.

1520
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:42,880
Hello.
- Hello.

1521
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,880
Tony, father had visited
the retreat centre yesterday.

1522
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:47,640
Good. He needs to be reformed.

1523
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:50,000
He came to know about
all the mischiefs happened there.

1524
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:55,960
Tony, I have reached a threshold.

1525
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:57,480
I can't take it anymore.

1526
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:00,720
Yesterday.. Do you know
what happened here yesterday?

1527
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,400
Your father's friend
and his family is here.

1528
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:04,800
Please serve them coffee.

1529
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,640
Daughter, he is Joy from America.

1530
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,160
She loves America.
- Oh, is it?

1531
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:20,320
Am I right, dear?

1532
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:25,960
Have it.
Mr. Trump is a good guy, isn't he?

1533
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:29,520
I don't think that he will reform.

1534
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,280
If it gets cancelled again

1535
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:35,320
the guy who came today,
will marry you.

1536
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,280
That is not possible, Dad.
- It is!

1537
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:41,520
I am not ready
to get embarrassed again.

1538
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,840
I value my dignity the most.

1539
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:47,800
If you oppose me..

1540
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:54,440
Tony, I swear upon God

1541
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,640
if I have to marry someone else

1542
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,520
I will not stay alive.
- No, Jessica..

1543
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,640
Jessica listen to me.
Hello..

1544
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:05,360
Listen to me.
Jessica.. Hello..

1545
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,960
Tony. Dear.

1546
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:34,400
Dude.
- Yes.

1547
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
She is innocent.

1548
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:38,440
She is a poor girl.

1549
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:43,800
Why did she love me?
I don't understand.

1550
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:48,840
Dear. - Yes.
- I can't do without her.

1551
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:56,480
Dude, I want her.
1552
01:46:08:040 --> 01:46:09:160
This wedding won't be cancelled.

1552
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:14,080
You will go even if I am not there.

1553
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:46,920
What do you want to say, Roy?

1554
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:48,920
The truth or lie?

1555
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:51,200
I will say only the truth.

1556
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:54,200
Good!

1557
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,560
Our testimonies were created.

1558
01:46:58,160 --> 01:47:00,360
It was me who made them say that.

1559
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:05,320
My intention was not to be caught
until Tony's wedding.

1560
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:12,040
What happened on the night
when Aby and Reetha met

1561
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:13,840
was totally different.

1562
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,520
Reetha.
Please don't misunderstand me.

1563
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:18,880
I am not that kind of a man.

1564
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,920
Moreover I love Prayaga
and not you.

1565
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,200
Reetha, please help me.

1566
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:29,720
Don't touch me!

1567
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:33,520
How dare you hit me?

1568
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:37,360
Hey.. Bastard!

1569
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:39,560
I will kill you.

1570
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:44,000
You.. - Leave me.
- Stop it.

1571
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:45,760
Leave him, Rita.
Leave.

1572
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,800
Leave me. - No, Aby.
- Get lost. - No, Aby.

1573
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,800
Dude, she hit me. She is mad.

1574
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,360
Get lost!
- Listen to me.

1575
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,880
Stop it. Aby, leave. - Dude..
- Get lost. - Leave, I say.

1576
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:57,360
Excuse me. Stop there.

1577
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:00,640
Why did you hit him?

1578
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:04,040
That's my wish.
Who the hell are you to ask that?

1579
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:05,320
Reetha.

1580
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:08,080
All men are the same.
Bastards.

1581
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:09,320
Stop it! Mind your words.

1582
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:11,480
Get lost.
- You.. - You..

1583
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:13,720
Leave me.

1584
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:30,680
Reetha.

1585
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:37,520
I was drunk and I didn't know
that she had fallen down.

1586
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:42,240
We realised the truth
only in the morning.

1587
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,520
I'm the one who killed Reetha, sir.

1588
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:50,800
They are innocent.

1589
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:52,560
Please release them.

1590
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:56,320
Tony's wedding is on the day
after tomorrow.

1591
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:57,800
That must happen at any cost, sir.

1592
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,080
Nice. Good.

1593
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:03,600
The story framed by you

1594
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,240
for Tony's wedding to happen
is a good one.

1595
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:07,120
Are you planning to do
a self-sacrifice?

1596
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:10,720
It's not a story. It's the truth.
- That's not the truth, Roy.

1597
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,560
Police is very near to the truth.

1598
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:17,600
We need some time to get
the solid evidence.

1599
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:22,920
Believe me, sir. I am ready
to accept the crime in court.

1600
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:23,880
Don't waste my time.

1601
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:28,240
Sir, you are spoiling my
brother's life. Keep that in mind.

1602
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,680
Are you threatening me?

1603
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:34,880
If a convict confesses the crime,
the court will accept that.

1604
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,720
You have no right
to keep us in custody.

1605
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:40,560
Don't teach me what I should do.

1606
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:43,280
This isn't the place
to show your heroism.

1607
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,720
I am the hero here.

1608
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:03,520
Nafeesa, I will bring
Uthappam and Rasgulla today.

1609
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,960
We found the culprit. - What?
We caught the culprit.

1610
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:07,120
What is he saying?

1611
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:08,800
Sir.

1612
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:12,280
We received the forensic report.

1613
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,400
The blood sample we found from the
terrace is matching to Roy's blood.

1614
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:24,560
I never expected this twist.

1615
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,280
Got it.

1616
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,440
We found the real culprit.

1617
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:30,480
Where are the villains?

1618
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:33,320
Are you sitting and enjoying here?
It's all over.

1619
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:35,920
They found the real culprit.

1620
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:38,200
He asked all of you
to go and watch the movie.

1621
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:39,920
Let's go and watch the movie.
Come.

1622
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,840
He shows the movie
once he finds the culprit.

1623
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:43,840
Sir. - Is everyone here?
- Yes, sir.

1624
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:45,280
Inform me when it's time
for the interval.

1625
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:46,960
Come.
Have a seat.

1626
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Finally Roy accepted it.

1627
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:56,240
Your story is the right one.

1628
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:01,760
The blood we found at the terrace
is yours according to the report.

1629
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:05,520
But I am sure that Roy is innocent.

1630
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,120
Iqbal.
- Sir.

1631
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,360
You took the first aid,
after the crime happened

1632
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:31,160
which you said
that you have done.

1633
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:35,240
This is enough to prove
that you are not guilty.

1634
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:43,480
You took the first aid at
the reception at around 1:45 a.m.

1635
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:46,960
But according to the post-mortem
report the death happened

1636
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,680
between 3:00 a.m. and 3:30 a.m.

1637
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:53,080
I can say that the culprit

1638
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:54,960
in this case is Tony.

1639
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:03,040
It's not me. I don't know anything.
- Sit down!

1640
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:06,040
Down.

1641
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:10,760
Iqbal.

1642
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:25,880
This happened at 3:05 a.m.

1643
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:29,840
Now I will show you,
what happened at 3:30 a.m.

1644
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:48,440
At the time of the incident

1645
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,960
Tony was with Reetha.

1646
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:00,680
No, I didn't kill anyone.

1647
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:04,120
Roy, I didn't kill anyone.
- Tony. - Aby. _ Tony

1648
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:05,960
You will do anything
when you are drunk.

1649
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:08,720
The proof for that is
you had broken the spine

1650
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:11,200
of a prostitute named Geetha
at Theni when you were drunk.

1651
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:12,640
Brother.
- No.

1652
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,040
Sir.

1653
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:18,960
Knowingly or unknowingly
you have taken a life.

1654
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:22,920
Tomorrow, you are not going
to the wedding hall

1655
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:24,600
but to the jail.

1656
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:33,840
Oh, God.

1657
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:36,080
Hey. - No!
Tony.

1658
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:39,000
Brother, it's my wedding tomorrow.
- Tony, please.

1659
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:40,480
Hey.
Listen to me.

1660
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:43,200
Hey. Don't worry.
Nothing wrong will happen.

1661
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,440
Don't be tensed.
- I am with you.

1662
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:48,360
Brother.
- Please.

1663
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:50,360
She won't be able to handle it.

1664
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,160
Why are you standing here?

1665
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:58,560
Didn't you get Tony on phone?

1666
01:53:58,880 --> 01:53:59,960
What did he tell you?
1667
01:54:04:480 --> 01:54:07:840
I won't be able to act like a clown

1667
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:09,040
in front of everyone again.

1668
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:14,920
I know, what I should do.
- Jesicca.

1669
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:16,960
Jesicca.

1670
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:31,400
Leave.
You cannot stay here anymore.

1671
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:39,360
Why are you staring like this?

1672
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:41,160
A vehicle will come here
to take you.

1673
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,520
Sir.

1674
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:01,480
Sir. - Hey, Nalini. You looked
better in the other dress.

1675
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:03,000
Carry on.
- Okay, sir.

1676
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:05,800
Good morning sir.
- Good morning.

1677
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:08,880
Make the arrangements to take
Prayaga to Kerala.- Okay, sir.

1678
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:10,560
Sir, I didn't do anything wrong.

1679
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:13,320
Reetha had fallen down
accidently when

1680
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:14,720
he was talking to
Jessica, over the phone.

1681
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:17,480
It's true that he followed her.

1682
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:20,160
Other than that,
he doesn't know anything else.

1683
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:22,680
Sir. Something wrong is
happening here.

1684
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:25,520
We had just met Reetha and Prayaga
there on that day.

1685
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:27,760
I don't know her.
Then why should I kill her?

1686
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:29,880
Sir, there were some
problems during their trip.

1687
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,400
We don't know anything about it.

1688
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:35,680
Tony, there is nothing suspicious

1689
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:37,080
in their trip together.

1690
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:39,400
I will tell you,
why they planned that trip.

1691
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:45,280
You will belong to Vinu
after 18 days.

1692
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:48,200
After that, we might not
meet again.

1693
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:50,280
Sooner or later,
you will also get married.

1694
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:55,200
Yes, let's go for a trip.

1695
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:58,560
A holiday trip to cherish
for a lifetime.

1696
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:00,600
Let's go and enjoy for a week

1697
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:02,240
and return after
celebrating the new year.

1698
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:03,960
Okay.

1699
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:12,400
Reetha and Prayaga joined you
in that trip.

1700
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:15,680
You know the stories from
there until the New Year's Eve.

1701
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:19,080
Something happened there
after the party

1702
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:22,640
which you are not aware.

1703
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:27,120
My investigation was about that.

1704
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:31,640
First, go and take a shower.

1705
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:34,200
No.
- Go and take a bath.

1706
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:35,800
Go.

1707
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:39,960
I like to oppose
everyone in this world

1708
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:41,640
except you.

1709
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:46,720
I will listen to you.

1710
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:49,320
I will only listen to you.

1711
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:51,480
Reetha go and take a shower.

1712
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:52,800
Go.
1713
01:57:35:480 --> 01:57:36:400
Goodnight.

1713
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:56,080
Hello.
Happy New Year, my dear.

1714
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:58,120
This year is ours.

1715
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:01,280
The year which will unite us.

1716
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:19,400
Get lost.

1717
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:24,680
Who was it?

1718
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:32,400
Bastard.

1719
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:34,760
He doesn't know
how to talk to people.

1720
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:37,120
Hey, what did he tell you?

1721
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:40,240
You don't need him.
- Reetha.

1722
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:41,840
You don't need him.

1723
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:49,360
Hey, Reetha.

1724
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:51,080
Open the door.

1725
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:55,160
What?
I need a peg.

1726
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:58,440
I have feelings for Prayaga
and not you.

1727
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:01,480
Please help me.
- Don't touch me!

1728
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:04,400
Hey leave him.
Reetha.

1729
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:07,920
Why did you thrash him?
That's my wish.

1730
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:09,920
Who the hell are you to ask that?

1731
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:25,600
You!

1732
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:29,520
Reetha didn't die
because of that fall.

1733
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:55,560
Vinu is upset.

1734
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:01,240
Tell him that you were kidding.

1735
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:05,760
No. I am serious.

1736
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:08,800
What are you serious about?

1737
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:11,320
About us not going back?

1738
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:15,360
Or that you won't let us
get married?

1739
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:18,600
What happened to you, Reetha?

1740
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:23,080
Shall we leave tomorrow?

1741
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:25,200
For the next trip.

1742
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:27,120
I have arranged everything.

1743
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:28,920
Are you mad?

1744
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:35,080
You have been behaving strangely
throughout this trip.

1745
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:38,800
There's a limit to everything.

1746
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:41,120
We will go.

1747
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:42,720
We will.

1748
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:43,960
I am not crazy.

1749
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:46,000
I am going back right now.

1750
02:00:48,240 --> 02:00:50,320
You are so drunk and..

1751
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:55,840
Will you go?
Will you leave me and go?

1752
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:58,320
I will!
1753
02:01:16:200 --> 02:01:18:200
Do you remember where you met me
for the first time?

1753
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:20,400
It's time. Come.
- Where is the key?

1754
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:22,920
Lock it.

1755
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:44,800
We moved in next door.

1756
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:47,480
Come out.
- No.

1757
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:50,080
I am locked inside.

1758
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:53,280
God! Are you not well?
- What?

1759
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:54,520
No.

1760
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:58,240
Oh, no! Don't cry.
1761
02:02:06:080 --> 02:02:09:800
You touched my heart that day.

1761
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:17,920
We have been together
ever since then.

1762
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:23,840
We have been together
in thick and thin.

1763
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,480
Didn't I share everything
that I got with you?

1764
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:40,720
I was in pain when you were hurt.

1765
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:43,400
Hey!
- Here..

1766
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:45,880
Come..
- No!

1767
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:48,720
Hey!

1768
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:56,920
I became a rebellious child
for you.
1769
02:03:03:720 --> 02:03:05:480
I don't know what my likes are.

1769
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:09,280
The colour you like,
the school you like

1770
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:12,680
the places you like to go.
Everything was your choice.

1771
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:15,520
I have never gone anywhere
without you.

1772
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:19,520
And now.. If you go with Vinu
all of a sudden..

1773
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:23,960
What will I do?

1774
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:27,960
Without you, I am nothing.

1775
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:29,720
Reetha!

1776
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:32,600
I am serious.

1777
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:36,480
I can't part with you.

1778
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:37,960
We are not parting ways.

1779
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:41,840
Marriage is an inevitable thing
in our lives.

1780
02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:44,160
Why are you being indifferent
for that?

1781
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:47,520
This is not love but madness!

1782
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:51,920
Yes. I am mad.

1783
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:53,960
I am crazy!

1784
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:56,160
I shouldn't have loved you so much.

1785
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,400
Now you want a new life!
1786
02:04:00:440 --> 02:04:03:200
There is no place
for my madness in that.

1786
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:06,960
So I must cease to exist.

1787
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:10,000
I must die.

1788
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:14,840
I would even die for you.

1789
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:18,920
Reetha, no!

1790
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:20,520
Please!

1791
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:22,960
Don't!

1792
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:24,360
Please!

1793
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:30,120
I'm even scared to die without you.

1794
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:31,960
Let's die together.

1795
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:49,440
The emptiness of losing a friend

1796
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:53,360
who was with her
like a shadow for around 16 years.

1797
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:58,520
Her inner feelings surfaced
when she got drunk.

1798
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:02,000
An extreme case of possessiveness.

1799
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:04,360
A Borderline Personality Disorder.

1800
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:13,280
I was sure that this wasn't a case
of suicide from the very beginning.

1801
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:17,320
July 21.
The day of Prayaga's engagement.

1802
02:05:18,240 --> 02:05:20,560
That was the first time
Reetha drove alone

1803
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:22,560
and went on a trip.

1804
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:26,280
She became violent
when she hit a policeman.

1805
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:38,360
She is gone. She left me.

1806
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:41,400
I have no one now.

1807
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:44,200
That information
was the turning point in this case.

1808
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:49,840
The rest was the final play
to make her confess.

1809
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:53,440
I'll say that Tony is the culprit.

1810
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:56,920
You are not going
to the wedding hall tomorrow.

1811
02:05:57,320 --> 02:05:58,400
You'll be going to the jail.
1812
02:06:00:600 --> 02:06:04:120
Sir, I want to talk to you.

1812
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:05,720
Reetha, no!

1813
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:10,960
I'm even scared to die without you.

1814
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:12,840
Let's die together.

1815
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:27,840
My Jessy.

1816
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:29,120
Give me a kiss.

1817
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:38,960
What happened?

1818
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:41,560
Are you fine?
Reetha.

1819
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:43,200
What happened, Reetha?

1820
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:48,160
Wait! Reetha!

1821
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:50,400
Wait up!

1822
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:52,120
Hey! Reetha!
- Tony!

1823
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:56,320
Who is that?
Who is with you?

1824
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:58,840
Jessy..
- Who is Reetha?

1825
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:00,520
Which Reetha?
- Tell me

1826
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:03,480
or I will come to the retreat
with my parents.

1827
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:07,320
Tell me! - Jessy!
It's not what you think!

1828
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:58,280
Let's go?
1829
02:08:03:360 --> 02:08:06:840
Let's go to a place
where no one would separate us?

1829
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:11,200
Come. Let's go.

1830
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:18,800
I am afraid to leave you here.

1831
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:52,760
No! Leave me!
1832
02:09:23:400 --> 02:09:24:720
No!

1832
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:48,960
Your vehicle is ready.

1833
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:51,680
The church is an hour from here.

1834
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:54,960
There is three hours left
for the wedding.

1835
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:57,000
So all the best!

1836
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:59,480
Wish you a happy married life!
- Thank you, sir. - Take care!

1837
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:00,680
Bye!

1838
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:04,040
Hey! - Mr. Karthik.
- Hey, start the car.

1839
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:08,200
That girl.. I mean Prayaga..

1840
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:11,800
Let's see.
Didn't I tell you?

1841
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:15,200
One doesn't become a culprit
just because they are guilty.

1842
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:19,800
My conscience tells me
what's right.

1843
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:22,000
That will be my final report.

1844
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:24,680
That's how it's supposed to be.

1845
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:29,240
A poetic justice..
- "Lord Shiva.."

1846
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:34,440
"Lord Shiva.."

1847
02:10:39,720 --> 02:10:41,600
Reetha, I am sorry.
1848
02:12:00:640 --> 02:12:05:760
"Achayans.."

1848
02:12:08,200 --> 02:12:12,920
"Achayans.."

1849
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:20,960
"Achayans.."

1850
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:34,520
"Want to make this stop.."

1851
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:39,360
"Want to make this stop.."
