2
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:46,577
You dwell in my heart.

3
00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:50,047
Whether its dusk or dawn.

4
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:53,047
Whether in light or darkness.

5
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:55,883
You're always with me.

6
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:59,682
lt was my mother's dying wish..

7
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:04,263
..to take the entire 'Bhajan Mandli'
group along with their family..

8
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:06,563
..on a trip to Badrinath.

9
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:09,601
Please do come.

Please join us on the trip..

12
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:17,171
..and pray for my mother's soul.

13
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:29,046
Why do souls become
restless after they die?

14
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,517
l mean, once you're dead
it's the end of all problems.

15
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:33,684
Why become restless?

16
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,125
That's not it.

17
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:40,726
Suppose the deceased
has a unfulfilled wish.

18
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,665
Then his son will fulfil it.

19
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:44,835
You won't go on the trip.

20
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,329

Her mother was in the
hospital for two years.

22
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:52,669
And he didn't even
come take a look.

23
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:55,009
He was making dollars in America.

24
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:58,017
This charade is for the world.

25
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:00,616
Not for his mother's soul.

26
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,451
No need to look so depressed..

27
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:04,954
..you won't get an off.

28
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,114

00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:29,738
l can't believe
you're coming with us.

32
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:32,442
The children are so happy.

She thinks l'm going
for beholding the Lord.

What's the total?

45
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:17,192
Three dozen, sir.
- Three dozen, right!

46
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:19,928
Then, three Sai Babas bonus.
- What?

47
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,727
They are in a big demand.

48
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:24,667
Send it to the white
Volvo parked there. - Okay.

49

Give me too.

53
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,063
Funny people, they're distributing
alcohol like holy water.

54
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:04,668
What's that?

55
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:07,271
What should l say?

56
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,879
Water of Ganges.

Oh, give me some.

58
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:16,347
Why is it so bitter?

59
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:17,979
Because the Ganges is polluted.

60
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:19,452
Oh!

61
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:28,561

Hello.
- We were fasting.

67

And you gave us alcohol.

68
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:51,950
Alcohol is permitted in fasts.

69
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:54,185
lt's made from sugarcane.

70
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:59,688
lt fills you with energy,
and makes you lightheaded.

71
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,999
Rascal. Keep the phone down.
- You'll never learn.

72
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:05,331
Abusing in the month
of 'Shravan' (pious month).

73
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:09,434
See. Truth sounds
bitter than liquor.

74
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,040
There's a limit to cracking jokes.

75
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:12,133
Papa, please.

76
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:15,314
What you did yesterday,
is a sin in mummy's view.

77
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:18,382
And mummy's fasting
today to repent for it.

l want to know.

79
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:23,447
How can she repent
for my sins by fasting?

80
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:28,083
Sushila, it's like
your phone's on charging..

81
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:29,718
..and my battery's getting charged.

82
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,288
Like wi-fi?

83
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,595
Chintu, careful.

84
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:35,656
Papa.

85
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:37,527
Get down.

86
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:39,595
Papa, we're practising.

87
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:41,297
Today's 'Janmastami'.

88
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:42,897
You've your exams tomorrow.

89
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:44,442
Who will write that?

90
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:46,067
Get down!

91
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:48,079
Why do you always stop
for religious things?

92
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:49,976
He'll be absolutely fine.

93
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:52,007
My son's playing Govinda.

94
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:55,213
My son won't become
Govinda or Chunkey Pandey.

95
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:58,053
He'll grow up to
become a cricketer.

96
00:07:58,124 --> 00:07:59,352
Get down. Get down.

97
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:00,650
Put me down.

98
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:07,361
Mahadev.
- Coming.

99
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:09,634
Let's go.
- Come soon.

100
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:12,236
Listen. Remove the
tag of Rs.250 from..

101
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:14,704
..all the new idols that we bought

102
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:19,469
Just watch how l sell
them for 10-12 thousand.

103
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:22,738
And keep one idol
from each on display.

104
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:24,640
Understand?
- Yes.

105
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,008
Come on.

106
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:32,216
One and only one
piece in the world.

107
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,821
This idol appeared
from the ground..

108
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:38,653
..when the temple at
Badrinath was being built.

109
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:40,431
What are you saying?

110
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:44,299
A great sage from Dwarka
set out for a journey on foot..

111
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:47,170
..and that afternoon
the sun was really scorching..

112
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:48,999
..l gave him a jug
of water to drink.

113
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:52,636
He was so pleased.

114
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:55,204
And gave me this idol.

115
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:58,307
And this idol turned
my luck around.

116
00:08:58,952 --> 00:09:00,783
l bought this, once a rented shop..

117
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:03,516
..and a three room
house in Bhooleshwar.

118
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:05,413
With terrace.

119
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:07,057
With terrace.

120
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:08,182
Amazing!

121
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:11,191
Mr. Kanji, sell this idol to me.

122
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:15,057
l am in big trouble.

123
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:19,004
l'll rot in hell if
l even think of selling my Lord.

124
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:21,639
Sell the Lord?
Look at what he's saying.

125
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,599
Mischievous... Lord.

126
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:26,267
Listen carefully.

127
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:28,079
You can hear His flute.

128
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:30,205
lt's time for him
to play His flute.

129
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,612
What are you saying?
- Try to hear with devotion.

130
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:34,585
Listen. you can hear
the echo of Gokul.

131
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:44,752
Heard it?

132
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:46,795
Can you hear?
- Yes, yes.

133
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:49,130
Now leave.
- Sell this idol to me.

134
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:50,367
Please, Mr. Kanji.

135
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:52,563
l'll let this idol
out of my sight..

136
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,402
..only when that
special person arrives.

137
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:55,839
The chosen one.

138
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:58,104
Who is that?

139
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:01,411
The sage had said that
A great devotee of Sai..

140
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:05,474
..from Rajasthan
will come for His ldol.

141
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:07,746
That's amazing.
- What?

142
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:09,879
That's me.
- No, no.

143
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:11,217
Look, there's my car.

144
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,485
RJ, Rajasthan.

145
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:15,952
And it also has
an 'Om Sai' sticker.

146
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:17,285
That's true.

147
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,897
What did you say your name was?

148
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:21,398
Bhanwar Lal.
- Bhanwar Lal?

149
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:25,166
Mahadev...it's him?

150
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:27,100
Who?
- lt's him?

151
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:30,703
What happened? - The sage
had written your name himself.

152
00:10:31,044 --> 00:10:31,976
Look.

153
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:33,410
Bhanwar Lal.

154
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:36,707
l don't understand
a word that's written here.

155
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:38,078
lt's written in Madrasi.

156
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:41,218
He was a Madrasi. Though
he lived in Dwarka but, look..

157
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:43,286
Great.

158
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:45,123
This idol now belongs to you.

159
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,853
Thank you.

160
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:48,119
Great.

161
00:10:48,227 --> 00:10:50,024
Kanji Money?
- Bhanwar Lal.

162
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:51,927
You only listen,
but don't understand.

163
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:54,459
l said l won't charge
you for this idol..

164
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:56,866
..but l will have to pay the sage.

165
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,435
Yes, of course.

166
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:02,166
Here you go. 100 rupees.

167
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:05,276
Only 100..
- Mahadev. Mahadev.

168
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:08,212
This is a question of devotion.
We cannot force anyone.

169
00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:10,979
Do you how much l had at that time?

170
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,278
Only 20 rupees.

171
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:13,646
Only 20 rupees. Remember?

172
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,778
So do you know what l did?

173
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:18,790
l was wearing a similar gold chain.
And l gave that to him.

174
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:20,886
lt's all about faith.

175
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:22,393
Anything you give is less.

176
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:23,827
Anything you give is less.

177
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,591
Wow. What a thought.

178
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:29,260
Notjust my gold chain,

Now, where will
this idol emerge from?

186
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,112
From the holy land of Mathura,
where else?

187
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:50,247
Glory to Sri Kanji Lalji Mehta.

188

..our business will prosper.

191
00:11:57,363 --> 00:12:00,799
Kanji. This is the God's idol,
don't call it a toy.

192
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:05,029
The Lord is only a delusion.

Why?

get your shop fixed..

203
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:34,193
..rather than going on a Haj.

204
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:35,393
God save me from devils.

205
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:39,063
Your shop will come crashing
down even if anyone sneezes.

206

Rain?

331
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:04,313
My hand's paining.

write my exam tomorrow.

333

in your mouth and write your paper.

You're scolding him.

But what about you?
- What did l do?

337
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:14,815
What?

338
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:17,320
The festivities
were left incomplete.

339
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,924
You've to admit that there's God.

340
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:20,157
You spread the rumour..

341
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:21,563
..and immediately
there was an earthquake.

announcement too seriously.

346

This news just came in
from parts of the country..

347
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:39,147
..that the idol of Sri
Krishna's eating butter.

..butter, buttermilk to
the idol of Krishna. - Oh, God!

352
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:52,293
The rumour has spread so far.

353
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:53,988
Please, eat it.

354
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:56,124
This is low-cholesterol cheese.

355
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:58,166
The Lord's so lucky.

356
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:01,064
Look at the things He's getting.

357
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:03,006
Earlier, people would
keep it in a covered platter..

358
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:04,064
..in front of Him.

359
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:05,972
But now they're feeding Him.

360
00:21:06,712 --> 00:21:07,701
Let Him enjoy.

361
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:09,313
lt's your fault.

362
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:13,878
Mumbai just experienced
a slight earthquake tremor..

363
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:16,513
..of 3.5 Richter scale,
which didn't cause..

364
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,850
..any harm to life or property.

365
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,357
See. Heard that?

366
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:24,028
But a shop in the flea
market has collapsed..

367
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,495
..which was closed at that time.

368
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:28,230
Must be Mohammad's shop.

369
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,129
According to our sources..

370
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:33,932
..the shop was registered to Mr.
Kanji Lalji Mehta.

371
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:40,444
lt's really surprising, because..

372
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:45,745
..there are other old shops in
this market which are still intact.

373
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:49,852
But Kanji Lalji Mehta's shop
has been completely destroyed.

374
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:54,022
This is Shweta Tiwari, with
cameraman Vaibhav Mishra, ABP News.

375
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:56,988
Sister, switch on ABP News quickly.

376
00:21:57,363 --> 00:21:58,261
We saw.

377
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,059
Brother-in-law's shop is gone.
lt's collapsed.

378
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:02,396
Pravin!
- Calm down, father.

379
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:04,666
No, sister.
Come there with the children.

380
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:06,932
l'm coming there with
father and the others. - Yes.

381
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:07,971
Yes, we're coming.

382
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,064
We're coming.

383
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:15,246
The idols of Gods
have gone underneath.

384
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,150
The shop is completely ruined

385
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,923
Doesn't seem like there
was ever a shop here.

386
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:33,422
What are you saying?

387
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,658
We had goods worth 25 lakhs.

388
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:38,302
And we'll have to
pay the scrap dealer..

389
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:39,837
..to have this cleared.

390
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,028
Why pay?

391
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:43,338
We'll give him one
of the broken idols..

392
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:45,570
..and say lt appeared
from the ground in Amarnath.

393
00:22:45,711 --> 00:22:47,542
What are you saying,
brother-in-law?

394
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:49,313
You'll soon be bankrupt.

395
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:51,574
Do you know the losses
you've incurred?

396
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,083
40 lakhs.

397
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:55,146
Goods worth 25 lakhs
bought on credit..

398
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:57,279
..and 15 lakhs spent
on renovation last month.

399
00:22:57,823 --> 00:23:00,314
40 lakhs? Where did
you get that kind of money?

400
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:05,062
We borrowed a part of the
amount by mortgaging the house.

401
00:23:05,998 --> 00:23:09,934
And l borrowed 10
lakhs from a friend.

402
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:11,900
And 5 lakhs from your own pocket..

403
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:15,506
Pravin, you fool.

404
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:17,074
You didn't even ask me.

405
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:21,212
How will we arrange
for such a huge sum?

406
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:24,814
There's hardly 30400
thousand in the bank.

407
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:27,683
And we don't even have jewellery.

408
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:32,289
Sushila. We'll manage.
- How?

409
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:35,621
Why don't you understand?

410
00:23:37,162 --> 00:23:38,925
lf you hadn't spoken
ill about the Lord..

411
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:40,828
..He wouldn't have
caused this earthquake.

412
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:44,260
His justice is silent.

413
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:46,566
Will you please stop preaching?

414
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:50,107
You mean to say, that the Lord..

415
00:23:50,442 --> 00:23:53,639
..who doesn't exist,
razed down my shop..

416
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:55,339
..because l spoke ill about Him?

417
00:23:56,882 --> 00:24:00,318
So, just to prove Himself..

418
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:03,983
..he razed down just
my shop in a fit of rage.

419
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:06,453
And if l still don't
believe in Him..

420
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:09,392
..he will make me
incur more losses? - Yes.

421
00:24:09,461 --> 00:24:10,485
What yes?

422
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:13,294
l still don't believe in You?

423
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:19,466
l haven't incurred any loss.

424
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:24,598
Look.

425
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:30,215
What's he doing?
- What..

426
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:32,513
Everything's lost, Kanji.

427
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:35,448
Only thing left
is this Godrej safe.

428
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:01,835
Rolex.

429
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:05,478
lt's a Rolex.
- No.

430
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:10,683
Mr. Dinesh. lsn't that
a Rolex watch you're wearing?

431
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:14,891
Must be worth 1 .5 -2 lakhs.

432
00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:16,488
lt's worth 10.

433
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:19,920
Mr. Kanji.

434
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:22,898
l am sure you read
the terms and conditions..

435
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,593
..before reading the policy.

436
00:25:25,237 --> 00:25:26,465
Not at all, sir.

437
00:25:26,538 --> 00:25:30,201
Your officer asked me
to sign at the places marked..

438
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:31,503
..and l did so.

439
00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:33,106
How irresponsible you are.

440
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:35,142
What happened, sir?

441
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:36,908
Your policy insures you against..

442
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:42,309
..accidents like theft,
fire, fraud.

443
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:44,319
Right. That's what we opted for.

444
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:46,215
But not against Act of God.

445
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:47,716
Act of God?

446
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:51,390
See, it's written here clearly.

447
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:52,552
Conditions apply.

448
00:25:52,664 --> 00:25:55,997
My glasses.. - ln the event
of loss or damage to the property..

449
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:59,899
..the insurance company
is not liable to pay..

450
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:05,675
..any amount if the damage
is caused by act of God.

451
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:08,413
And here are your signatures.

452
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,539
lt's written in such small letters.

453
00:26:13,118 --> 00:26:14,312
And nobody reads that.

454
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:16,645
What is 'Act of God'?

455
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:19,785
lncidents that are
not caused by humans.

456
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:24,293
Like? - Like earthquake,
Tsunami, Thunder.

457
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,692
You cannot claim
insurance in such cases.

458
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,629
Because these are
natural calamities.

459
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:31,100
But l don't believe in God.

460
00:26:31,203 --> 00:26:32,192
Tell him.

461
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:34,829
l don't care if you do or don't.

462
00:26:35,307 --> 00:26:36,968
You're signatures are right here.

463
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:38,665
l am so sorry.

464
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:41,406
Sorry? What sorry?

465
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,747
Sir.

466
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:44,975
Sir, l've invested my
entire earnings in the shop.

467
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,344
Even my house is mortgaged.

468
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:47,349
And you're saying sorry.

469
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:50,012
l know, but your claim
cannot be approved.

470
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:51,887
You may go now.

471
00:26:55,527 --> 00:27:00,055
No, sir. l won't leave
until my claim isn't approved.

472
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,289
Security.

473
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:05,597
Sir..
Sir, why are you calling security?

474
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:08,299
l'm talking to you decently.
- Yes, sir.

475
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:09,999
Take him away, please.
- Why call the security..

476
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:11,770
Come on.
- Just a minute.

477
00:27:11,843 --> 00:27:13,003
Just a minute.

478
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:14,010
Come on.

479
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,842
You just know how
to swindle our money.

480
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:17,045
Mind your language.

481
00:27:17,115 --> 00:27:19,208
You should be publicly beaten.

482
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:20,444
Throw him out.

483
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,679
Get out! Get out!

484
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:27,323
You get this for
2000 in the flea market.

485
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:31,226
Don't you understand?

486
00:27:31,296 --> 00:27:32,456
lt's Act of God.

487
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:35,459
You want money, don't you?
Go and ask God. Take him away.

488
00:27:35,534 --> 00:27:36,523
Act of God.

489
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,830
Just a second. Just a second.

490
00:27:40,906 --> 00:27:41,895
Leave me.

491
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:44,170
Act of God.

492
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:47,204
So, you believe in God.
- Yes.

493
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:50,906
You believe that God
is present everywhere.

494
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:54,444
ln him, him, that madam, him.

495
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:56,310
God dwells in everyone.
- Yes.

496
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:57,410
And me?

497
00:27:57,923 --> 00:28:00,289
Mr. Dinesh, you believe
that God dwells in me too.

498
00:28:01,827 --> 00:28:02,657
Yes.

499
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:03,750
Thank you.

500
00:28:03,862 --> 00:28:05,352
Act of God. l didn't do it.

501
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,590
God did. lt's 'Act of God'.

502
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:09,890
God slapped him again.
l didn't do it.

503
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:16,336
And now God will shoot you..
And you will die.

504
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:18,472
Later, will your
family get the claim..

505
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:20,238
..or will that be
'Act of God' as well?

506
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:22,112
Tell me.
- No.

507
00:28:22,214 --> 00:28:23,306
Kanji, what are you doing?

508
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:25,178
Why are you scared? Take the gun.

509
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,310
Get down now, come on.

510
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:51,874
The phone's ringing again.

511
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:53,333
Forget it.

512
00:28:54,212 --> 00:28:55,679
You switched of your mobile..

513
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:57,715
..that's why they're
calling on the landline now.

514
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:59,714
Tell them l am not at home.

515
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:03,082
They say if we don't
arrange for the money..

516
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:05,548
..we'll have to vacate
the house in a month.

517
00:29:09,428 --> 00:29:11,658
l had so many dreams.

518
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:14,628
l wanted to make Jigna a pilot.

519
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:16,500
And my son a cricketer.

520
00:29:18,603 --> 00:29:20,798
But soon l'll even lose this house.

521
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:24,765
Everything's lost.

522
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,076
Everything will be fine.

523
00:29:29,614 --> 00:29:31,138
What will be fine?

524
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:34,313
All l have is the shop property.

525
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,983
l'll sell that and
repay the mortgage.

526
00:29:39,124 --> 00:29:43,185
Om Jai Jagdish Hare.

527
00:29:43,462 --> 00:29:45,589
Swami..

528
00:29:46,698 --> 00:29:48,632
Yes. Yes, he's here.

Yes, Nimish. Go ahead.

533
00:30:02,147 --> 00:30:03,910
Did you find a buyer
for that property?

534
00:30:09,654 --> 00:30:10,746
What are you saying?

535
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:11,948
What happened?

536
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:13,149
What happened?

537
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,890
He's saying, there are broken
idols of God on that land..

538
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:19,430
..so it's become inauspicious.

539
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:22,493
The place has become cursed.
- Oh, God!

540
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:24,301
No one will buy this land..

541
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:26,132
..that's the rumour in the market.

542
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:30,699
Nimish. 100 years later,
when people find..

543
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:35,041
..idols of God under that land, the
prices will shoot up by 4 times.

544
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:36,437
Four times.

545
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:39,507
And people will construct
a temple there as well.

546
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:41,250
lf anyone wants the
buy the land he can..

547
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,445

<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

He's gone crazy.

560
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:23,422
You will file a case
against an insurance company..

561
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:24,655
..worth 3000 crores!

562
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,421
l'm sure there are

..who have filed a case
against the insurance company.

Who controls this world?

00:31:54,593 --> 00:32:00,463
Who's that sitting
high up in the sky?

570
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:08,871
Why are You hiding
behind the clouds?

571
00:32:09,874 --> 00:32:14,402
Why are You afraid of being seen?

572
00:32:14,613 --> 00:32:15,875
Kanji.
- Yes.

573
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:17,437
How will you fight the case?

574
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:18,539
That's simple.

575
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:21,308
lf your Lord can
appear in the temple..

576
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:25,117

ln the last riots,
l defended some innocent Hindus.

And my own people did this to me.

Look, l cannot fight your
case in this condition..

658
00:36:32,203 --> 00:36:36,367
..but if the lawyers
refuse to take up your case..

Hanif. Do you believe in Allah?

665
00:36:58,563 --> 00:36:59,723
Of course.

666
00:37:00,298 --> 00:37:02,528
God, Allah, they are all the same.

667
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:06,066
So, l am fighting against Him.

668
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:08,263
So, why are you helping me?

669
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:11,107
You're not the only pleader.

670
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:13,070
Everyone does.

671
00:37:13,978 --> 00:37:16,776
Some pleads to Him,
and some against Him.

672
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:21,784
Where do you want
to send this notice?

673
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:26,848

Address.

No.
- Then.

The judge will dismiss your
case in the first hearing.

676

l mean, l don't have His address..

677
00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:37,898
..but of the places
where people look for Him.

678
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:43,473
You're our benefactor,
our friend.

679
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:45,168
So scare us.

680
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:48,802
Why ruin our present, by telling
us about an unknown future.

681

You're our benefactor,
our friend.

So scare us.

Why ruin our present, by telling
us about an unknown future.

Your saints and sages,
spread shams in Your name.

685
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:07,394
They put a price tag on you.

686
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:11,299

..the owner of that shop,
Kanji Lalji Mehta..

695
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:36,558
..has filed a case against God.

696
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:39,424
This is the reaction of
people over the matter.

697
00:38:39,497 --> 00:38:41,192
Down with..
- Kanji!

698
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:42,492

This case won't be
accepted in the court.

700
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,559
Trust me.

701
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:48,303
Just leave it to me.

702
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:51,334
You won't even have
to come to the court.

703
00:38:52,243 --> 00:38:53,232
Relax.

704
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:06,153
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

705
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,315
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

706
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,819
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

707
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:13,254
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

708
00:39:13,464 --> 00:39:15,329
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

709
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,659
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

710
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:20,938
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

711
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:22,299
Greetings.

712
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:26,341
l feel we should
meet that person once..

713
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:29,777
..and listen to his problems,
and try to understand.

714
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:32,738
Well, l..

715
00:39:46,297 --> 00:39:49,357
Although we all hold
different positions..

716
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:50,900
..in different communities.

717
00:39:53,237 --> 00:39:54,898
But our God is one.

718
00:39:54,972 --> 00:39:55,961
Later.

719
00:39:56,507 --> 00:40:01,308
And today, a human
has accused our God.

720
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:05,374
This is not a personal war.

721
00:40:06,884 --> 00:40:08,613
lnstead, it's a
battle for all humans..

722
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,120
..who have faith in God.

723
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:15,619
So l've decided that l,
Siddeshwar Maharaj..

724
00:40:15,727 --> 00:40:18,696
..and Gopi Maiyya,
will go to the court..

725
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:24,495
..to give that shameless
human a fitting reply.

726
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:29,703
Down with..
- Kanji!

727
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:33,141
Yes, it's a democracy, where
everyone is treated equally.

728
00:40:33,411 --> 00:40:34,844
And now, even God.

729
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:37,975
Even God will have to stand in
the High Court's witness box..

730
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:40,141
..where the most dangerous
criminals stand for trial.

731
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:41,749
Strange, but true.

732
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:44,720
l still say, think about it once.

733
00:40:46,324 --> 00:40:47,586
l already have.

734
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:50,151
Today's the first hearing..

735
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:51,786
..and the judge
will decide whether..

736
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:54,058
..such a case can
be accepted or not.

737
00:41:10,414 --> 00:41:11,438
lt's a good omen.

738
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:14,412
Really nice. Let's go.

739
00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:22,918
Many believers are standing outside
the court shouting slogans against Kanji.

740
00:41:22,994 --> 00:41:24,723
Down with..
- Kanji!

741
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:26,354
Down with..
- Kanji!

742
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:28,226
Down with..
- Kanji!

743
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:29,993
Down with..
- Kanji!

744
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:31,726
Down with..
- Kanji!

745
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:35,301
Many 'dharma gurus'
have come to the court..

746
00:41:35,373 --> 00:41:37,307
..to give a reply of
Kanji's baseless allegations.

747
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:40,242
Very few people have been
allowed in the courtroom as well.

748
00:41:40,745 --> 00:41:42,042
Swami, give me your blessings.

749
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:45,909
Move aside, no one
will touch the swami.

750
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:47,348
Move aside, move aside.

751
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:49,646
Down with..
- Kanji!

752
00:41:49,754 --> 00:41:51,346
Down with..
- Kanji!

753
00:41:51,422 --> 00:41:53,913
Down with..
- Kanji!

754
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:55,618
Down with..
- Kanji!

755
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:57,317
Down with..
- Kanji!

756
00:41:57,862 --> 00:42:00,160
Down with..
- Kanji!

757
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:03,689
Kanji, people say you're
doing this for publicity?

758
00:42:03,768 --> 00:42:05,531
Down with..
- Kanji!

759
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,297
Down with..
- Kanji!

760
00:42:07,371 --> 00:42:09,271
Down with..
- Kanji!

761
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:17,304
You?
- You will sit here.

762
00:42:18,749 --> 00:42:19,977
Sit, sit.

763
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,511
Hey insurance..

764
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,115
How's the Rolex?

765
00:42:28,492 --> 00:42:29,754
Working fine.

766
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:30,816
Relax.

767
00:42:34,098 --> 00:42:35,087
Relax.

768
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:38,267
He's the one who spread
the rumour about God eating butter.

769
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:45,965
All rise.

770
00:42:49,213 --> 00:42:50,407
Kanji, get up.

771
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:12,060
Mr. Kanji Lalji Mehta.
- Yes, sir.

772
00:43:12,703 --> 00:43:16,104
We've been informed that
you'll defend your own case.

773
00:43:16,274 --> 00:43:17,502
Yes..

774
00:43:18,676 --> 00:43:20,735
l don't have any other option,
Your Honour.

775
00:43:21,946 --> 00:43:23,345
The other lawyers are scared.

776
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:26,212
So, l'll have to defend this case..

777
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:27,716
My lordship, this is
a baseless appeal.

778
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:29,777
A publicity stunt.

779
00:43:30,421 --> 00:43:32,753
There's no cause of action
that can be proved in court.

780
00:43:33,624 --> 00:43:37,788
So l suggest, under
order 7 rule no.1 1 ..

781
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:39,496
..of the code of civil procedure.

782
00:43:39,964 --> 00:43:42,023
This case be
straightaway dismissed..

783
00:43:42,366 --> 00:43:43,697
..for out of cause action.

784
00:43:46,037 --> 00:43:49,006
Your Honour,
my English isn't that good..

785
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:52,041
..but l do
understand that he's asking..

786
00:43:52,143 --> 00:43:53,940
..to shut down this
case immediately.

787
00:43:54,011 --> 00:43:55,501
Right? You're right.

788
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:58,345
l don't want to get into
this hassle in the first place.

789
00:43:58,582 --> 00:44:00,311
l'm a Gujarati, businessman.

790
00:44:00,918 --> 00:44:03,580
doesn't make a difference to me.

791
00:44:03,854 --> 00:44:05,287
The insurance people said that..

792
00:44:05,356 --> 00:44:07,017
..God has razed down my shop.

793
00:44:07,325 --> 00:44:09,384
Or, he's the One behind
your shop's destruction.

794
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:11,586
So, l said fine. Ask God
to compensate for my losses.

795
00:44:11,696 --> 00:44:12,594
Case closed.

796
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:14,528
But why will God
raze down your shop?

797
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:17,799
Fool!

798
00:44:17,902 --> 00:44:18,891
Please.

799
00:44:19,203 --> 00:44:21,899
Please come to the
witness box and speak.

800
00:44:27,511 --> 00:44:30,002
May Lord forgive his naiveness.

801
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:34,107
May Lord forgive his naiveness.

802
00:44:34,986 --> 00:44:37,420
May Lord forgive his naiveness.

803
00:44:37,922 --> 00:44:39,753
Why will God raze down my shop?

804
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:43,692
Exactly, why will
God raze down my shop?

805
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:46,696
He has other important
things to do.

806
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,893
So, tell the
insurance company to pay me.

807
00:44:50,501 --> 00:44:51,593
End of matter.

808
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:53,533
Why will the
insurance company pay you?

809
00:44:53,904 --> 00:44:55,633
You've agreed to the
terms and conditions..

810
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,900
..of the insurance company.

811
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:58,208
Exhibit no.1 , sir.

812
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:00,743
Right. Then God will
have to compensate for it.

813
00:45:01,512 --> 00:45:03,343
Call upon,
Lord Ram, Shiva, Ganpati..

814
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:05,438
..Whoever you get
along better with.

815
00:45:05,716 --> 00:45:08,742
Do some of your hocus-pocus, or..
- Fool!

816
00:45:10,154 --> 00:45:13,055
The only way to find
God is through salvation.

817
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:16,416
God won't descend down on earth..

818
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:18,353
..for a ordinary man like you.

819
00:45:19,663 --> 00:45:21,324
He would only if He exists.

820
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:27,164
You're turnover is in millions,
and this is a small settlement.

821
00:45:27,405 --> 00:45:28,201
Just say yes.

822
00:45:28,305 --> 00:45:31,399
l will even give you
cash discount. Really.

823
00:45:34,011 --> 00:45:35,205
l object, Your Honour.

824
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:40,911
Mr. Kanji is calling
service to God a business.

825
00:45:41,052 --> 00:45:44,317
Of course it's business.

826
00:45:45,022 --> 00:45:46,785
Take a visit to
any religious place.

827
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:48,518
First you've to pay for parking.

828
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:51,685
Then, pay for standing
in the smaller queue.

829
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:54,762
Then pay for the flowers,
blanket, candle.

830
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:57,297
And the donation box is
kept right before the idol.

831
00:45:57,368 --> 00:45:59,336
As soon as you bow down,
you've to put something in it.

832
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:02,372
And they even charge
for the offerings of God.

833
00:46:02,907 --> 00:46:06,900
Just like we're charged for
seeing wax statues in the museum.

834
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:10,469
Similarly, they charge us for
seeing the stone idols in temples.

835
00:46:11,715 --> 00:46:13,478
And the priests
have salaries as well.

836
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:15,041
His is less, and his is more.

837
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,087
And you even have
income tax benefits.

838
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:18,686
Right?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

839
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,682
So, where's the service?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

840
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:24,694
And, Your Honour, there's never
recession in this business.

841
00:46:24,762 --> 00:46:25,558
No.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

842
00:46:25,663 --> 00:46:27,893
ln fact, they do better
business during recession.

843
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:29,899
Oh, God! Oh my, God!
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

844
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:31,356
Relax.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

845
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:33,364
Consider that it is a business.

846
00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:35,203
Still, why are you
asking them for compensation?

847
00:46:36,006 --> 00:46:37,405
You pay premiums
for your insurance..

848
00:46:37,508 --> 00:46:39,066
..so you can ask
them for a compensation.

849
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,800
But why will the temple pay you?

850
00:46:41,545 --> 00:46:45,572
Because...l've paid premiums
in their temples as well. - What?

851
00:46:45,749 --> 00:46:46,943
What nonsense?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

852
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:50,313
l knew you won't believe me..

853
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:53,788
..so l have brought
all the proofs along.

854
00:46:54,158 --> 00:46:57,127
Look. These are the
receipts of the premium..

855
00:46:57,194 --> 00:46:59,526
..l've been paying
for the last 18 years.

856
00:47:00,131 --> 00:47:01,530
On my wife's advice.

857
00:47:01,832 --> 00:47:02,821
Look

858
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,562
My first premium
was for 1501 rupees..

859
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:09,369
There's a well-known temple
in the South. l paid it there.

860
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:13,867
Then, l've been paying
1000 rupees every year..

861
00:47:13,944 --> 00:47:15,571
..at Lord Ganesha's stall.

862
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:17,738
lt's called a mandap.

863
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:22,646
And, your honour, my mother-in-law
used to be very sick.

864
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,486
So, the temple
authorities said, Pay us 1 1 ,000..

865
00:47:26,757 --> 00:47:28,657
..perform a veneration
and watch the miracle.

866
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:31,291
We performed the veneration
and my mother-in-law passed away.

867
00:47:32,396 --> 00:47:34,694
That was a good thing,
but l also lost 1 1 ,000.

868
00:47:35,366 --> 00:47:37,561
And they didn't
refund a single rupee.

869
00:47:38,802 --> 00:47:40,895
And then, donation at the mosque..

870
00:47:40,971 --> 00:47:44,134
..blanket at the shrine,
candle at church, alms for beggar..

871
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:46,540
..incense sticks,
veil for Mother Goddess.

872
00:47:46,944 --> 00:47:50,710
ln total l've paid around 10
lakhs in all these stores.

873
00:47:50,781 --> 00:47:51,770
Enough!

874
00:47:52,716 --> 00:47:53,705
Enough!

875
00:47:55,686 --> 00:47:57,745
Don't call it a store.

876
00:47:58,155 --> 00:47:59,816
lt's called a temple.

877
00:48:01,325 --> 00:48:04,294
And people donate
willingly at the temple..

878
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:07,387
..for the peace and
prosperity of their family.

879
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:09,428
Even l gave this amount..

880
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,730
..for the peace and
prosperity of my family.

881
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:13,934
And not for fun.

882
00:48:14,638 --> 00:48:17,266
But your God snatched
all the peace from my life.

883
00:48:17,341 --> 00:48:19,332
Because only God can
cause earthquakes.

884
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,275
Humans cannot do it.

885
00:48:21,545 --> 00:48:24,378
So tell me, don't l've a right
to ask God for compensation?

886
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:25,505
Mr. Kanji.

887
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,677
You've a tiff with God, don't you?
- Yes.

888
00:48:27,985 --> 00:48:29,509
So why don't you ask Him
directly for compensation?

889
00:48:29,653 --> 00:48:30,779
Why are you asking the temples?

890
00:48:32,356 --> 00:48:37,316
Which company supplies
electricity to your home?

891
00:48:38,395 --> 00:48:39,453
Reliance.
- Reliance.

892
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,930
So if there's an
electricity problem in your home..

893
00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:44,194
..you will call up the
Reliance office, won't you?

894
00:48:44,535 --> 00:48:46,469
You won't call
Anil Ambani directly.

895
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:50,797
Mr. Anil,
we've a electricity problem.

896
00:48:52,376 --> 00:48:53,365
Silence.

897
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:55,273
What do you mean?

898
00:48:55,946 --> 00:48:56,970
What do you mean?

899
00:48:57,414 --> 00:49:02,442
These priests, the saints
are officers of God. - No.

900
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:04,146
They aren't officers.

901
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:06,319
Officers are educated people.

902
00:49:06,957 --> 00:49:09,118
They are...

903
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:11,358
They are salesmen, Your Honour.

904
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,091
They are collection agents..

905
00:49:15,165 --> 00:49:16,962
..because they own God's franchise.

906
00:49:17,067 --> 00:49:18,432
Your Honour.

907
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:23,302
This man's an atheist.

908
00:49:25,276 --> 00:49:29,474
He doesn't know what he's saying.

909
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:33,746
But, we are saints.

910
00:49:34,585 --> 00:49:35,882
We will forgive him.

911
00:49:37,187 --> 00:49:42,648
But the world will never
forgive him for this grave sin.

912
00:49:42,726 --> 00:49:45,092
You won't be able to set
foot out of your house..

913
00:49:45,162 --> 00:49:47,460
..if you say anything else.

914
00:49:47,765 --> 00:49:51,201
ls that your concern for me..

915
00:49:51,302 --> 00:49:53,600
..or are you threatening
me in front of the judge?

916
00:49:55,673 --> 00:49:58,540
We...are concerned for you.

917
00:49:58,742 --> 00:50:00,767
They pay me up quickly.
End this matter.

918
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:02,811
My lord, this is enough.

919
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,877
The donation receipts,
the submissions.

920
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:07,946
There's no agency agreement
between God and my clients.

921
00:50:08,986 --> 00:50:10,715
Kanji is saying baseless things.

922
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:14,491
We cannot file a case
against God for such a small thing.

923
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:15,547
Small?

924
00:50:16,794 --> 00:50:18,625
My lord, this isn't small issue.

925
00:50:19,063 --> 00:50:20,655
That shop means everything to me.

926
00:50:21,298 --> 00:50:22,424
My means of earning.

927
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:24,364
The only way to support my family.

928
00:50:25,235 --> 00:50:28,898
And l built that
shop with hard work.

929
00:50:29,506 --> 00:50:31,838
Now, it's just a piece of land.

930
00:50:32,409 --> 00:50:34,274
And no one's ready
to buy that as well.

931
00:50:35,045 --> 00:50:37,946
These people say,
Donate with faith..

932
00:50:38,015 --> 00:50:39,778
..and you'll never be wronged.

933
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:43,445
And the insurance people say
Pay your premiums on time..

934
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,317
..we're there in
your troubled times.

935
00:50:45,522 --> 00:50:48,389
l gave donations and
also paid my premiums.

936
00:50:48,726 --> 00:50:50,626
But none of them are
willing to help me.

937
00:50:51,395 --> 00:50:53,022
l am an ordinary human.

938
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,763
A middle-class man.

939
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:56,257
My family, my wife and children..

940
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:57,800
..will be forced
to live on streets.

941
00:50:58,435 --> 00:50:59,527
No, my lord.

942
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:02,933
You'll have to give me a chance
to defend my case in this court.

943
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:06,376
And the constituency of
lndia gives me the right..

944
00:51:06,477 --> 00:51:08,377
..to voice my plea in this court.

945
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,847
So please, my lord.

946
00:51:20,324 --> 00:51:25,819
One crore is a big amount
for a middle-class businessman.

947
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,822
And especially, when it's
a question of his survival.

948
00:51:31,034 --> 00:51:37,337
So, the court accepts
Kanji Lalji Mehta's case.

949
00:51:44,014 --> 00:51:45,003
Silence.

950
00:51:47,418 --> 00:51:49,409
And only after
carefully examining..

951
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,747
..all the evidences and arguments..

952
00:51:51,822 --> 00:51:53,449
..the court will give
its verdict, whether..

953
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:56,788
..Mr. Mr. Kanji Lal will
get his compensation or not.

954
00:51:57,561 --> 00:51:59,426
And if he does,
then who will pay him?

955
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:03,290
The insurance company or,
the temple.

956
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,594
The court's adjourned for the day.

957
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,000
Wait. Wait.

958
00:52:16,547 --> 00:52:20,210
You can perform all
the veneration you want..

959
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:23,178
..and ring those bells
as many times you wish.

960
00:52:24,288 --> 00:52:27,086
Your God razed down my shop.

961
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:32,827
And now, l will alone
shut down all his shops..

962
00:52:33,163 --> 00:52:35,791
..or my name isn't
Kanji Lalji Mehta.

963
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:39,824
And this isn't my concern for you.

964
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:42,498
lt's a direct warning.

965
00:52:42,973 --> 00:52:44,201
Yes.

966
00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:32,380
You're safe here,
it's a government property.

967
00:53:33,757 --> 00:53:35,315
But how will you escape them?

968
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:47,166
Down with..
- Kanji!

969
00:53:47,237 --> 00:53:48,636
Down with..
- Kanji!

970
00:53:48,739 --> 00:53:50,297
Down with..
- Kanji!

971
00:53:50,374 --> 00:53:52,001
Down with..
- Kanji!

972
00:53:52,109 --> 00:53:53,838
Down with..
- Kanji!

973
00:53:53,944 --> 00:53:55,605
Down with..
- Kanji!

974
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:57,703
Down with..
- Kanji!

975
00:53:57,781 --> 00:54:01,080
Sir. The case has been accepted.

976
00:54:01,151 --> 00:54:02,846
l'm worried about
Sushila and the children.

977
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,080
l'll take a cab, you go.

978
00:54:04,221 --> 00:54:05,848
But how can l leave you alone.

979
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:08,118
l'm going to the police station,
for protection.

980
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:09,658
Drop her home as well. Go.

981
00:54:10,193 --> 00:54:11,160
Be careful, dear.

982
00:54:11,261 --> 00:54:12,990
Go, go, go.

983
00:54:13,664 --> 00:54:15,131
Are the boys ready?

984
00:54:18,535 --> 00:54:19,763
Remember.

985
00:54:20,704 --> 00:54:23,605
Kanji shouldn't get
to see daylight. That's it.

986
00:54:26,543 --> 00:54:27,942
There he is.

987
00:54:55,439 --> 00:54:57,566
Catch him. There he goes.

988
00:54:58,408 --> 00:55:00,000
Don't let him go.

989
00:55:08,385 --> 00:55:10,478
Go...go...go...Govinda.

990
00:55:11,388 --> 00:55:14,016
govinda aala re..

991
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:17,923
Go...go...go...Govinda.

992
00:55:22,933 --> 00:55:24,798
Go...go...go...Govinda.

993
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,370
Go...go...go...Govinda.

994
00:55:49,526 --> 00:55:50,857
Let's sit down and talk.

995
00:55:51,094 --> 00:55:52,618
All l did was file a case.

996
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,530
lf you try to talk
they'll cut you in half.

997
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:56,755
Look behind.

998
00:55:57,067 --> 00:55:58,534
Catch him.

999
00:55:58,602 --> 00:55:59,967
Faster!

1000
00:56:03,473 --> 00:56:04,462
Who are you?

1001
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:06,168
Krishna Vasudev Yadav.

1002
00:56:06,576 --> 00:56:07,474
What?

1003
00:56:07,544 --> 00:56:10,570
Krishna Vasudev Yadav from Gokul.

1004
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:12,671
So you're from UP.

1005
00:56:12,883 --> 00:56:15,374
You can call me Kanhaiyya.

1006
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:16,747
Catch him, catch him.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1007
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:20,645
Catch him.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1008
00:56:26,196 --> 00:56:27,458
Careful.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1009
00:56:45,215 --> 00:56:47,046
Are you a man or a stuntman?

1010
00:56:47,517 --> 00:56:49,109
You can call me a stuntman as well.

1011
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:52,144
But people call
my stunts a miracle.

1012
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:54,757
Miracle.
- Hold on.

1013
00:56:55,225 --> 00:56:57,159
You aren't wearing a helmet either.

1014
00:56:57,761 --> 00:56:58,989
There he is.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1015
00:56:59,062 --> 00:57:00,962
There's a lot of traffic on earth.

1016
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:08,003
Where do you think you're going,
go that way.

1017
00:57:09,873 --> 00:57:11,272
Drive on the road.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1018
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:25,822
Faster!
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1019
00:57:25,922 --> 00:57:27,890
Go...go...go...Govinda.

1020
00:57:30,427 --> 00:57:31,894
That was a narrow escape.

1021
00:57:32,195 --> 00:57:34,220
Now, take me to Brahmanwadi.

1022
00:57:35,665 --> 00:57:40,932
Go straight then take a left,
then right and another left.

1023
00:57:41,505 --> 00:57:43,166
And you'll be home, go on.

1024
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,738
You brought me this far,
so drop me home as well.

1025
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:47,342
My job's to show the way..

1026
00:57:47,444 --> 00:57:49,378
..it's yourjob to
get to the destination.

1027
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:55,515
Keep it.

1028
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:56,313
Thank you so much.

1029
00:57:56,419 --> 00:57:58,114
You're so kind.
- Thank you.

1030
00:57:58,455 --> 00:58:00,855
Take care.
Go...go...go...Govinda.

1031
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:13,197
Papa!
- Sushila.

1032
00:58:13,703 --> 00:58:15,102
ls everything fine?

1033
00:58:15,906 --> 00:58:17,806
Go up and take a look in the house,
you'll know.

1034
00:58:18,275 --> 00:58:19,833
Thankfully we survived, otherwise..

1035
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:21,502
No, l'll talk to the police.

1036
00:58:21,611 --> 00:58:22,441
Don't worry.

1037
00:58:22,512 --> 00:58:27,108
They hurled stones and
acid bottles in our house.

1038
00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:29,878
l don't care lf l die.

1039
00:58:29,986 --> 00:58:31,283
But the children.

1040
00:58:32,022 --> 00:58:34,718
lf Jigna would've
been hit by that acid..

1041
00:58:34,825 --> 00:58:36,190
l won't let anything
happen to them.

1042
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:37,419
l am their father. Please.

1043
00:58:37,494 --> 00:58:38,984
So, understand the
duties of a father.

1044
00:58:39,062 --> 00:58:40,893
Withdraw the case.
- You're a fool.

1045
00:58:41,731 --> 00:58:43,062
l'm about to lose my house.

1046
00:58:45,435 --> 00:58:46,834
Where will we stay?

1047
00:58:47,204 --> 00:58:49,468
On the streets, or in their house?

1048
00:58:50,607 --> 00:58:53,098
Do we have any other option?
Why don't you understand?

1049
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:54,802
Come on, Jigna. Sit in the car.

1050
00:58:56,279 --> 00:58:57,644
He's made a mess of things.

1051
00:58:57,714 --> 00:58:59,306
l won't leave papa.

1052
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:01,884
l'll slap you if you refuse.
- No, mother.

1053
00:59:01,985 --> 00:59:03,816
Come inside, sit inside.

1054
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:07,887
Please..

1055
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:53,895
Hello.

1056
00:59:54,571 --> 00:59:55,560
Hello.

1057
00:59:56,406 --> 00:59:58,203
Who is it?
- Bhagwan (God).

1058
00:59:58,708 --> 00:59:59,697
What?

1059
01:00:00,143 --> 01:00:02,475
lf you were a Muslim,
l would've said Allah.

1060
01:00:02,846 --> 01:00:04,780
lf you were a Christian,
then Jesus Christ.

1061
01:00:05,415 --> 01:00:08,145
You're a Hindu, so Krishna.

1062
01:00:13,456 --> 01:00:14,753
You, here?

1063
01:00:16,126 --> 01:00:19,562
You're an excellent stuntman,
really.

1064
01:00:19,663 --> 01:00:20,391
Very good.

1065
01:00:20,497 --> 01:00:22,488
l'm sure you're
acting is decent as well.

1066
01:00:23,066 --> 01:00:25,899
Why don't you approach
some television channel?

1067
01:00:25,969 --> 01:00:30,497
They keep remaking
Ramayan and Mahabharat.

1068
01:00:30,974 --> 01:00:32,498
Krishna.

1069
01:00:34,177 --> 01:00:36,372
Suited-booted Krishna.

1070
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,404
Here to teach me a lesson.

1071
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:41,410
Look.

1072
01:00:41,985 --> 01:00:43,714
Look there.

1073
01:00:43,887 --> 01:00:45,514
Gods are bare-bodied.

1074
01:00:45,822 --> 01:00:47,119
Like this.

1075
01:00:47,624 --> 01:00:49,956
They're never fully covered.

1076
01:00:51,361 --> 01:00:53,022
That's your wedding photo, right?
- Yes.

1077
01:00:53,129 --> 01:00:54,391
Wearing that traditional attire.

1078
01:00:54,497 --> 01:00:56,727
So, did you only wear
a traditional attire..

1079
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,994
..since your wedding?

1080
01:00:58,101 --> 01:00:59,568
No, right?
- No.

1081
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:02,837
See. That's our older image.

1082
01:01:03,139 --> 01:01:05,437
Conch in one hand,
mace in the other.

1083
01:01:05,508 --> 01:01:07,237
Where are yours?

1084
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:10,302
lf l keep holding them all day,
won't my arms hurt?

1085
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:14,072
Think.

1086
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:17,113
Actually, our latest photos
haven't been updated on Facebook.

1087
01:01:17,587 --> 01:01:19,179
People still use the
older ones, and we let them.

1088
01:01:19,289 --> 01:01:20,256
We don't have a problem.

1089
01:01:20,323 --> 01:01:22,257
Let them.
- That's enough.

1090
01:01:22,492 --> 01:01:24,153
You're boring me now.
Get out, leave.

1091
01:01:27,731 --> 01:01:28,720
Mahadev!

1092
01:01:29,899 --> 01:01:33,835
Mahadev!
- Only you can hear and see me.

1093
01:01:34,738 --> 01:01:36,296
Yes, coming. Coming.

1094
01:01:41,277 --> 01:01:42,209
Mahadev!

1095
01:01:42,312 --> 01:01:43,904
What happened?
What happened, Kanji?

1096
01:01:44,347 --> 01:01:45,177
See him.

1097
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:47,078
He calls himself God.

1098
01:01:47,917 --> 01:01:49,111
l can see him.

1099
01:01:49,419 --> 01:01:50,681
He can see you.

1100
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:53,755
My name's Krishna,
your new neighbour.

1101
01:01:54,557 --> 01:01:55,922
Neighbour?

1102
01:01:56,726 --> 01:01:57,715
Neighbour?

1103
01:01:57,961 --> 01:02:00,327
The person Kanji had
mortgaged his house to..

1104
01:02:00,363 --> 01:02:01,694
..has sold it to me.

1105
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:04,495
Here are the documents.

1106
01:02:07,704 --> 01:02:11,299
And, Kanji bhai,
sorry for thatjoke about God.

1107
01:02:13,309 --> 01:02:14,401
What's this?

1108
01:02:15,078 --> 01:02:17,046
How can he sell my house to him?

1109
01:02:17,313 --> 01:02:19,144
l was about to pay him on time.

1110
01:02:19,249 --> 01:02:20,238
l already paid him.

1111
01:02:20,316 --> 01:02:21,544
This isn't done.

1112
01:02:21,684 --> 01:02:22,878
This is my house.
Nobody can just buy it.

1113
01:02:22,952 --> 01:02:25,386
Relax. Chill.

1114
01:02:25,889 --> 01:02:28,949
When you get your
compensation from God..

1115
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:32,893
..you can repay me, l will leave.

1116
01:02:32,962 --> 01:02:35,954
And anyway, l always leave
after my project is over.

1117
01:02:36,066 --> 01:02:39,399
Why buy the house
when you want to leave?

1118
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:40,961
Are you a agent?

1119
01:02:42,939 --> 01:02:44,406
l am not that low.

1120
01:02:44,741 --> 01:02:46,106
l've a consultancy firm.

1121
01:02:46,543 --> 01:02:48,704
l give advice to people.
- Advice.

1122
01:02:48,778 --> 01:02:50,769
Anyone who thinks of me.

1123
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,541
Public service.
Service open to all.

1124
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:55,344
A solution to every problem.

1125
01:02:55,952 --> 01:02:58,420
Sometimes it gets slightly delayed.

1126
01:02:58,521 --> 01:03:00,216
But...l always get there on time.

1127
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:01,956
There's delay but not denial.

1128
01:03:02,058 --> 01:03:04,026
Just like l came here,
to help Kanji bhai.

1129
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:05,817
Help me?

1130
01:03:05,929 --> 01:03:07,294
l found out about your condition..

1131
01:03:07,363 --> 01:03:08,796
..only after l brought the house.

1132
01:03:09,899 --> 01:03:11,093
The court case, lost your shop..

1133
01:03:11,167 --> 01:03:12,429
..and your wife and children too.

1134
01:03:12,502 --> 01:03:14,402
Kanji bhai, don't worry.

1135
01:03:14,871 --> 01:03:16,133
You can stay here.

1136
01:03:16,973 --> 01:03:19,498
ln return,
l will only use your things.

1137
01:03:19,809 --> 01:03:21,208
Television, fridge, etcetera.

1138
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:26,540
Fine, but remember..

1139
01:03:26,649 --> 01:03:28,617
..one day l will
buy this house back from you.

1140
01:03:28,918 --> 01:03:29,907
So be it!

1141
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,051
l mean, l promise.

1142
01:03:33,623 --> 01:03:35,557
He's a nice man.
- Something you said.

1143
01:03:35,758 --> 01:03:37,623
No, just.. Cheers.

1144
01:03:39,562 --> 01:03:41,723
Calls himself God.
l think he's drunk.

1145
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:45,791
Thank you, for letting
me stay in my own house.

1146
01:03:46,169 --> 01:03:47,329
Thank you so much.

1147
01:03:48,738 --> 01:03:49,727
Thank you.

1148
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:53,607
l will sleep outside
on the terrace.

1149
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:55,476
And you can sleep
wherever you want.

1150
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:56,569
lt's your house.

1151
01:03:57,013 --> 01:03:58,480
Thank you. Goodnight.

1152
01:03:58,948 --> 01:04:00,939
And yes,
the light switch is at the back.

1153
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:02,642
Switch off the lights
before you go to sleep.

1154
01:04:07,323 --> 01:04:08,756
Another power failure.

1155
01:04:10,093 --> 01:04:13,927
No. you switched it off.
- No, l didn't.

1156
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,288
You're drunk.

1157
01:04:15,365 --> 01:04:16,354
So?

1158
01:04:19,035 --> 01:04:20,024
l see.

1159
01:04:31,347 --> 01:04:34,043
Go...go...go...Govinda.

1160
01:04:38,688 --> 01:04:41,248
Go...go...go...Govinda.

1161
01:04:45,929 --> 01:04:48,056
Go...go...go...Govinda.

1162
01:05:12,488 --> 01:05:15,082
Case on God admitted. Paper,
paper, paper.

1163
01:05:15,158 --> 01:05:16,853
High Court has put it's seal on it.

1164
01:05:23,433 --> 01:05:26,129
Through the notice prepared
by advocate Hanif Qureshi..

1165
01:05:26,236 --> 01:05:29,034
..Kanji Lalji Mehta's case
on God has been accepted.

1166
01:05:29,105 --> 01:05:30,231
l think he's mad.

1167
01:05:30,306 --> 01:05:31,466
l'm leaving.

1168
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:32,701
Hey Jigna, what happened?

1169
01:05:39,148 --> 01:05:41,241
See, his wife ran away.

1170
01:05:41,451 --> 01:05:43,043
Who can live with that madman?

1171
01:05:43,219 --> 01:05:45,312
l don't even talk to him.

1172
01:05:45,388 --> 01:05:47,379
Or the Lord might
punish us as well.

1173
01:05:52,328 --> 01:05:55,195
What a splendid bike.
- But, who is he?

1174
01:05:55,398 --> 01:05:57,127
l think he arrived just last night.

1175
01:05:59,202 --> 01:06:02,103
Who's playing this classical music?

1176
01:06:02,205 --> 01:06:06,801
l've heard that the new
guest is really handsome.

1177
01:06:06,876 --> 01:06:08,844
Don't l look handsome?

1178
01:06:09,445 --> 01:06:10,639
Get inside.

1179
01:06:17,687 --> 01:06:19,018
Hey, Hari Prasad.

1180
01:06:21,524 --> 01:06:22,752
Hey, Chaurasiya.

1181
01:06:23,593 --> 01:06:25,288
What's all this?

1182
01:06:26,029 --> 01:06:27,291
l was waking up the birds!

1183
01:06:27,363 --> 01:06:28,352
What? Who?

1184
01:06:28,698 --> 01:06:30,256
l was waking up the birds!

1185
01:06:30,667 --> 01:06:32,328
Practice. l was practising.

1186
01:06:32,869 --> 01:06:34,234
lt's a good thing to
do in the morning.

1187
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:36,497
Don't do it.
Don't do all this in my house.

1188
01:06:38,908 --> 01:06:40,842
lt's your house you can
play anything you want.

1189
01:06:41,344 --> 01:06:42,971
Good morning.
- What?

1190
01:06:43,179 --> 01:06:45,044
Not me,
there's a lady in your house.

1191
01:06:46,482 --> 01:06:47,744
Hello.

1192
01:06:48,351 --> 01:06:49,511
Hello.

1193
01:06:49,652 --> 01:06:51,847
l brought breakfast.

1194
01:06:52,021 --> 01:06:54,080
l thought since sister-in-law
isn't home, so.. - No need.

1195
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:55,784
l'll have bread and butter.

1196
01:06:58,261 --> 01:06:59,387
Where's the butter?

1197
01:07:00,463 --> 01:07:01,452
l ate it.

1198
01:07:04,934 --> 01:07:07,494
There was half a kilo of butter
in there, you ate it all.

1199
01:07:07,737 --> 01:07:09,864
lt's my favourite thing.
So l ate it.

1200
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:11,231
Tell me one thing.

1201
01:07:11,507 --> 01:07:13,304
Why do they make it so salty?

1202
01:07:13,943 --> 01:07:15,410
Just like his name.

1203
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:18,039
Are you all alone?

1204
01:07:18,114 --> 01:07:19,741
Your wife?
- Of course.

1205
01:07:20,016 --> 01:07:21,244
Sixteen thousand..
- What?

1206
01:07:21,317 --> 01:07:22,341
She lives in Sholapur.

1207
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,680
What did you hear?
- Sixteen thousand.

1208
01:07:27,023 --> 01:07:29,423
No, she lives in Sholapur.

1209
01:07:29,759 --> 01:07:31,158
He can't handle one..

1210
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:32,852
..how can l have sixteen thousand.

1211
01:07:32,929 --> 01:07:35,159
Please go. He's a big liar.

1212
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:36,492
He was boring me yesterday.

1213
01:07:36,566 --> 01:07:38,830
Please go.
- Give it.

1214
01:07:41,037 --> 01:07:42,937
lf you eat all that
you'll get a stomach ache.

1215
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,700
First half a kilo of
butter and now this.

1216
01:07:45,141 --> 01:07:46,335
l'll be fine.

1217
01:07:49,379 --> 01:07:51,745
Hello.
- Sir, l'm speaking from ABP News.

1218
01:07:51,848 --> 01:07:53,748
l am standing below your house.

1219
01:07:54,984 --> 01:07:55,973
Sir.

1220
01:07:56,586 --> 01:07:59,487
Look, l don't want to be
a piece of news for you.

1221
01:08:00,123 --> 01:08:01,750
And don't call me again.

1222
01:08:02,492 --> 01:08:04,392
Sir, just one interview.

1223
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:09,529
Since he filed a case
against God, he's become alone.

1224
01:08:11,934 --> 01:08:13,697
One has to tread
on such a path alone.

1225
01:08:14,804 --> 01:08:17,534
Let's see how far our friend goes.

1226
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:22,602
The advocate who
prepared Kanji's notice.

1227
01:08:22,678 --> 01:08:24,236
He lives that way.

1228
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:26,281
Excuse me, advocate Hanif Qureshi.

1229
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:28,015
He lives right there.

1230
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:30,484
Where does advocate
Hanif Qureshi live?

1231
01:08:30,553 --> 01:08:31,952
He lives right there.

1232
01:08:32,221 --> 01:08:34,314
Advocate Hanif Qureshi lives there.

1233
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:43,628
155 letters, and calls too.

1234
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:47,700
Bhuj, Latur, Vishakapatnam.

1235
01:08:48,337 --> 01:08:50,862
Their claims haven't
been approved..

1236
01:08:51,374 --> 01:08:54,537
..for the past few
years due to 'Act of God'.

1237
01:08:55,778 --> 01:08:59,839
All they all want you
to defend their cases.

1238
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:05,644
Son, l've lost my
house in the earthquake.

1239
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:12,052
My son and his wife died too.

1240
01:09:16,265 --> 01:09:17,698
This is my grandson.

1241
01:09:18,267 --> 01:09:20,861
His cancer needs to be operated.

1242
01:09:21,404 --> 01:09:25,670
lf l get the insurance money,
everything will be alright.

1243
01:09:26,676 --> 01:09:28,473
This is Aslam.

1244
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:29,533
Hello.
- Hello.

1245
01:09:29,912 --> 01:09:31,903
He lost everything in the Tsunami.

1246
01:09:32,815 --> 01:09:36,307
He lost all the money he had
saved for his sister's marriage.

1247
01:09:38,921 --> 01:09:40,286
So you file a case too.

1248
01:09:40,356 --> 01:09:41,880
l'll be cast out..

1249
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:45,951
..if l go against
the priest or community.

1250
01:09:46,062 --> 01:09:48,428
Look, Aslam.
You aren't going against anyone.

1251
01:09:49,098 --> 01:09:53,159
Those who taught you religion,
taught you to pray..

1252
01:09:53,469 --> 01:09:57,735
..you're just questioning
them why Allah did this to you.

1253
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:01,768
But, the priest..
- Aslam.

1254
01:10:02,311 --> 01:10:05,109
When you lose your home..

1255
01:10:05,748 --> 01:10:08,546
..will the priest let
you stay in his house?

1256
01:10:09,952 --> 01:10:14,082
Religion is for people,
people aren't made for religion.

1257
01:10:19,762 --> 01:10:23,789
Hanif, how long will it
take to ready their papers?

1258
01:10:24,534 --> 01:10:26,195
As long as it will take me to type.

1259
01:10:27,503 --> 01:10:28,595
Let's begin.

1260
01:10:50,593 --> 01:10:53,494
First one crore, and now
claims worth 400 crores.

1261
01:10:53,696 --> 01:10:54,958
Kanji Mehta!

1262
01:10:55,331 --> 01:10:56,992
Advocate Sardesai
is caught between..

1263
01:10:57,099 --> 01:10:59,192
..the insurance company
and religious organizations.

1264
01:10:59,302 --> 01:11:01,429
For God's sake,
prove that God exists.

1265
01:11:01,704 --> 01:11:03,729
And...and...
make God pay all this!

1266
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:07,307
The temples, mosques, churches,
they will pay everything.

1267
01:11:07,376 --> 01:11:08,365
Kanji.

1268
01:11:09,078 --> 01:11:10,875
Wasn't your fight with your God?

1269
01:11:10,947 --> 01:11:13,211
Silence please!
- So why call me here?

1270
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:18,920
Priest, how can l say
which God of which religion..

1271
01:11:18,988 --> 01:11:23,357
..was behind this earthquake,
or that Tsunami?

1272
01:11:23,793 --> 01:11:25,385
That's your department.

1273
01:11:25,962 --> 01:11:29,159
Your Honour, they're in
constant touch with God.

1274
01:11:29,398 --> 01:11:31,093
They're always in contact.

1275
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:35,301
Why don't you tell me
Who was responsible?

1276
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:38,932
Why would our God harm
people of our own religion?

1277
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,535
God will never do such a thing!

1278
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:42,305
Silence.
- He loves his children!

1279
01:11:42,745 --> 01:11:45,009
Allah doesn't hate
his followers either!

1280
01:11:45,114 --> 01:11:46,877
Relax.
- Please be seated.

1281
01:11:49,285 --> 01:11:53,415
The court needs some time
to study all these cases.

1282
01:11:53,789 --> 01:11:58,522
Anyone related to this
case cannot leave the country.

1283
01:11:58,594 --> 01:11:59,686
What?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1284
01:11:59,762 --> 01:12:00,694
Court is adjourned.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1285
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:02,959
Long live..
- Kanji!
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1286
01:12:03,065 --> 01:12:04,692
Long live..
- Kanji!

1287
01:12:04,767 --> 01:12:06,462
Long live..
- Kanji!

1288
01:12:06,535 --> 01:12:08,025
Long live..
- Kanji!

1289
01:12:08,104 --> 01:12:09,696
Long live..
- Kanji!

1290
01:12:09,839 --> 01:12:11,466
Long live..
- Kanji!

1291
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:13,132
Long live..
- Kanji!

1292
01:12:13,242 --> 01:12:15,506
Long live..
- Kanji!

1293
01:12:15,578 --> 01:12:21,710
This is government property,
you're safe here.

1294
01:12:22,485 --> 01:12:30,483
But how will you escape them,
in temples, churches and mosques?

1295
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:51,776
What are you thinking, Leeladhar?

1296
01:12:52,481 --> 01:12:55,075
This has gone beyond the limit.

1297
01:12:55,785 --> 01:13:01,223
Stop all the shams that you're
running in the name of faith.

1298
01:13:04,727 --> 01:13:06,285
Otherwise, the day isn't far when..

1299
01:13:06,629 --> 01:13:09,928
..no one will even spare
alms in the name of God.

1300
01:13:12,068 --> 01:13:13,057
Thank you.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1301
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:17,239
You don't understand, Leeladhar..
- Thank you.

1302
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:42,755
This is actually a serious matter.

1303
01:13:43,365 --> 01:13:45,526
People are making him a hero..

1304
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:49,264
..and the claim
amount is increasing.

1305
01:13:49,338 --> 01:13:51,602
Will you just tell us about
the problems or do something?

1306
01:13:53,142 --> 01:13:54,666
Next week,
l've a religious programme..

1307
01:13:54,744 --> 01:13:56,405
..on the Star Cruise, in Singapore

1308
01:13:56,946 --> 01:13:59,312
And the judge says
l cannot leave the country.

1309
01:13:59,381 --> 01:14:01,246
Do something.
- l would.

1310
01:14:01,317 --> 01:14:03,444
But it's the court,
not the parliament..

1311
01:14:03,519 --> 01:14:06,420
..where we can break a few
chairs and the job's done.

1312
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:08,187
lt's the court.

1313
01:14:08,624 --> 01:14:09,750
Let me think.

1314
01:14:10,459 --> 01:14:12,051
Well, there's one way.

1315
01:14:12,128 --> 01:14:13,356
l know it's an old idea..

1316
01:14:13,462 --> 01:14:15,453
..but these days
it's a lot in fashion.

1317
01:14:16,465 --> 01:14:18,092
Laxman Mishra guarantees..

1318
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:19,862
..that you'll get
the sympathy of people.

1319
01:14:19,935 --> 01:14:21,300
l guarantee it.

1320
01:14:21,737 --> 01:14:22,726
Thank you.

1321
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:26,306
Lord blessed us with everything.

1322
01:14:27,276 --> 01:14:30,575
The earth, the air, water,
the flora, fauna, everything.

1323
01:14:32,481 --> 01:14:36,781
Did He ever ask us for service tax?
- No?

1324
01:14:37,253 --> 01:14:39,312
Did he ever ask us for sales tax?
- No.

1325
01:14:40,189 --> 01:14:45,525
And today, a madman has
dragged Him to court..

1326
01:14:46,495 --> 01:14:50,488
..so, will we stay quiet?
- No.

1327
01:14:51,534 --> 01:14:52,762
We will fight.

1328
01:14:53,502 --> 01:14:54,969
We will fight together.

1329
01:14:55,738 --> 01:15:00,903
And so, guiding us on
this path, our beloved..

1330
01:15:02,011 --> 01:15:09,941
..and revered Sri Siddeshwar
Maharaj will fast unto death.

1331
01:15:10,753 --> 01:15:12,721
He will go on a hunger strike.

1332
01:15:14,523 --> 01:15:17,083
Glory to..
- Siddeshwar Maharaj

1333
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:21,118
Today's the third day of
Siddeshwar Maharaj's hunger strike.

1334
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:23,564
Many religious
organizations and devotees..

1335
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:27,897
..from different parts of the country
have supported this movement.

1336
01:15:28,337 --> 01:15:30,532
On the other hand,
Kanji Lalji Mehta..

1337
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:33,130
..has refused to talk to the media.

1338
01:15:33,475 --> 01:15:35,102
He won't take a sip of water.

1339
01:15:35,177 --> 01:15:36,337
He won't stop.

1340
01:15:36,979 --> 01:15:38,344
He's an ascetic.

1341
01:15:38,747 --> 01:15:47,746
Repeat after me, Glory
to Ram, glory to Sita-Ram!

1342
01:15:59,335 --> 01:16:02,702
Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna!

1343
01:16:02,805 --> 01:16:05,205
Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna!

1344
01:16:05,274 --> 01:16:07,606
And what does God say?

1345
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:10,504
Awaken the power of your devotion.

1346
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:15,044
And go tell Kanji, you
can do anything you want.

1347
01:16:15,117 --> 01:16:19,679
We will continue..

1348
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:22,753
They're defaming me
taking Krishna's name.

1349
01:16:23,392 --> 01:16:24,620
Mine too.

1350
01:16:25,027 --> 01:16:26,358
What have you got to do with this?

1351
01:16:26,462 --> 01:16:27,451
l do.

1352
01:16:27,763 --> 01:16:30,561
When they're defaming you,
they're defaming me too.

1353
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:32,095
You're my friend after all.

1354
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:35,869
Look, Kanji bhai, it's
the era of publicity.

1355
01:16:36,038 --> 01:16:39,735
These imposters like to show off.

1356
01:16:40,142 --> 01:16:42,201
l am fighting for my right,
that's all.

1357
01:16:42,945 --> 01:16:46,176
And you will win this fight
only when you expose their lies..

1358
01:16:46,582 --> 01:16:50,348
..and that's possible only
when you speak to the people.

1359
01:16:51,453 --> 01:16:55,480
Even Krishna had to
enter the ring to kill Kans.

1360
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:58,525
Enough of your fairytales.

1361
01:16:59,762 --> 01:17:01,889
But l did understand one thing.

1362
01:17:03,098 --> 01:17:08,001
Now watch...
how l expose them and their God.

1363
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:12,864
He's not going to spare me.

1364
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:19,876
Hello, and welcome to
a very special episode..

1365
01:17:19,982 --> 01:17:21,244
..of Oh My God!

1366
01:17:21,483 --> 01:17:23,212
Why is this episode special?

1367
01:17:23,419 --> 01:17:25,979
Because Kanji Lalji Mehta..

1368
01:17:26,055 --> 01:17:30,890
..is finally here to
answer all your questions.

1369
01:17:32,594 --> 01:17:35,825
Many of you think
he's crazy and cynical.

1370
01:17:36,832 --> 01:17:40,268
He's the person who...
filed the case against God.

1371
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:42,860
Kanji bhai, welcome to our show.

1372
01:17:42,972 --> 01:17:44,803
My first question is..

1373
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:47,198
Why are you after all
the religious sects?

1374
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:50,107
You media personnel, l tell you..

1375
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:54,415
Your questions sound
more like allegations..

1376
01:17:54,483 --> 01:17:56,451
..and make us sound guilty.

1377
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:00,848
l respect all religion
and don't believe in any.

1378
01:18:00,956 --> 01:18:02,446
This man will never change.

1379
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:05,026
And if God exists,
he will answer all my questions.

1380
01:18:05,427 --> 01:18:07,952
Notjust that,
he will support me in my fight.

1381
01:18:08,797 --> 01:18:09,786
How?

1382
01:18:12,968 --> 01:18:15,198
When you were small, a small child.

1383
01:18:15,771 --> 01:18:19,002
What would you do to ask
your papa for chocolate?

1384
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:22,840
l mean, would you chant his name.

1385
01:18:22,945 --> 01:18:24,776
Papa, give me chocolates.

1386
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:27,239
Or, did you venerate
him with incense sticks..

1387
01:18:27,349 --> 01:18:29,340
..or throw flowers...
- No, l didn't do any of that.

1388
01:18:29,785 --> 01:18:32,618
l would directly ask him
whatever l wanted. - Exactly.

1389
01:18:32,688 --> 01:18:34,349
Exactly. l'm doing the same thing.

1390
01:18:34,823 --> 01:18:39,624
People have always told me,
that God is like a father-figure.

1391
01:18:39,762 --> 01:18:43,789
Maybe? But how can l believe,
as long as l don't see Him.

1392
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:47,431
You're an atheist,
how can God appear before you?

1393
01:18:49,571 --> 01:18:50,731
Eat. Eat.

1394
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:56,066
Kanji bhai, even l believe that
God's like a father-figure. - Yes.

1395
01:18:56,412 --> 01:18:58,004
So, will he appear before me?

1396
01:18:58,247 --> 01:19:00,306
Do you believe in temples,
idols etcetera?

1397
01:19:00,549 --> 01:19:03,313
Yes, l do.
- Then He won't.

1398
01:19:03,519 --> 01:19:04,508
But why?

1399
01:19:04,753 --> 01:19:06,744
Because you're searching
for Him in temples and idols.

1400
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:08,616
Then why does
He have to come personally?

1401
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:10,418
No, this is wrong.

1402
01:19:10,759 --> 01:19:12,124
God does exist.

1403
01:19:12,194 --> 01:19:14,025
l couldn't find
a decentjob for two years.

1404
01:19:14,129 --> 01:19:17,826
l prayed that if l find a job,
l will shave my head.

1405
01:19:17,933 --> 01:19:19,628
And see, l found a job.

1406
01:19:19,768 --> 01:19:21,827
Oh, you shaved
off the entire thing.

1407
01:19:23,272 --> 01:19:24,637
Just imagine.

1408
01:19:24,873 --> 01:19:28,934
You're all dressed and
leaving for work in the morning..

1409
01:19:29,144 --> 01:19:31,203
..and as soon as
you open your door..

1410
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,804
..you see a pile of hair.

1411
01:19:34,183 --> 01:19:37,277
Black hair, white hair,
some with dandruff.

1412
01:19:37,619 --> 01:19:38,881
Some have lice.

1413
01:19:39,822 --> 01:19:42,017
There's a pile of
every kind of hair.

1414
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:44,254
Tell me how you will feel.

1415
01:19:44,359 --> 01:19:45,826
l won't like it at all.

1416
01:19:46,095 --> 01:19:48,962
lsn't it? So,
imagine how bad God feels.

1417
01:19:49,798 --> 01:19:52,198
God opens his door,
and there's hair scattered around.

1418
01:19:52,468 --> 01:19:55,164
Kanji bhai always
has the right logic.

1419
01:19:55,237 --> 01:19:56,829
Do you know what's
done with all these hairs?

1420
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,502
They are sold.

1421
01:20:01,043 --> 01:20:04,444
These hairs are sold in America,
London, etcetera...

1422
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:08,415
ln short, your faith is sold.

1423
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:09,639
That's it.

1424
01:20:11,453 --> 01:20:12,477
He is right.

1425
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:14,416
He's got a point.

1426
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:17,655
But that money is used to
run schools, orphanages..

1427
01:20:17,726 --> 01:20:19,717
..hospitals, charitable trusts.

1428
01:20:19,828 --> 01:20:21,090
Do you have a problem
with that too?

1429
01:20:21,597 --> 01:20:24,828
lt's just like a tobacco
seller builds a cancer hospital.

1430
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,865
They have to do
these things, madam.

1431
01:20:29,338 --> 01:20:31,135
Because all this
is unaccounted money.

1432
01:20:31,473 --> 01:20:33,873
lf you don't show
any legal transaction..

1433
01:20:33,942 --> 01:20:36,342
..then the lncome Tax
people will put you behind bars.

1434
01:20:37,112 --> 01:20:39,910
l've a problem with their
way of extracting the money.

1435
01:20:40,315 --> 01:20:42,647
Just like the mafia
scares us with a gun..

1436
01:20:42,718 --> 01:20:44,481
..these people scare us
in the name of the Lord.

1437
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:45,485
That's a good one.

1438
01:20:45,554 --> 01:20:47,419
Your child's stars
are unfavourable.

1439
01:20:47,856 --> 01:20:48,754
He's unlucky.

1440
01:20:48,857 --> 01:20:50,654
There's an inauspicious
issue in his horoscope.

1441
01:20:50,726 --> 01:20:52,819
Saturn's influencing his stars...

1442
01:20:52,895 --> 01:20:53,884
What is this?

1443
01:20:54,963 --> 01:20:57,864
He is just born, let him breathe.

1444
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:02,266
And this is where all
their religious hoaxes begin.

1445
01:21:02,604 --> 01:21:05,004
Notjust this lifetime,
but they also scare you..

1446
01:21:05,073 --> 01:21:07,007
..in the name of
your next life. Yes.

1447
01:21:07,276 --> 01:21:09,039
lf you don't do this and this..

1448
01:21:09,111 --> 01:21:11,102
..then you'll become a
dog in your next lifetime.

1449
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:14,913
Or, if you do this,
you'll be born as a insect..

1450
01:21:15,017 --> 01:21:16,006
..and go to hell.

1451
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:19,019
And then, they read out an
entire itinerary of hell.

1452
01:21:19,922 --> 01:21:22,049
You'll be made to
sleep on a bed of nails.

1453
01:21:22,124 --> 01:21:23,785
Thrown in the sea of fire.

1454
01:21:23,859 --> 01:21:25,724
Fried in hot oil.

01:21:26,828 --> 01:21:28,090

<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1456
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,293

<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1457
01:21:37,105 --> 01:21:38,094
Too good.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1458
01:21:40,309 --> 01:21:42,539
So, what's the definition of
religion according to you?

1459
01:21:42,911 --> 01:21:45,106
l believe, where there's religion..

1460
01:21:45,447 --> 01:21:47,142
..there's no place for honesty.

1461
01:21:47,683 --> 01:21:51,210
And where there's truth,
you don't need religion.

1462
01:21:51,286 --> 01:21:52,548
He's absolutely right.

1463
01:21:53,155 --> 01:21:54,520
What's the role..

1464
01:21:54,623 --> 01:21:56,648
..of caste and
religion in a person's life?

1465
01:22:07,603 --> 01:22:09,696
They do just one thing, madam.

1466
01:22:10,038 --> 01:22:12,370
Either it makes them helpless.

1467
01:22:12,441 --> 01:22:13,931
..or a terrorist.

1468
01:22:20,582 --> 01:22:21,640
He's too good.

1469
01:22:21,717 --> 01:22:23,048
He'll never change.
- Sister.

1470
01:22:23,118 --> 01:22:24,676
Oh my God.

1471
01:22:24,853 --> 01:22:27,219
Oh my God, Kanji bhai.

1472
01:22:27,723 --> 01:22:30,817
Really, you've changed
my concept about God.

1473
01:22:30,892 --> 01:22:31,881
Honestly.

1474
01:22:31,994 --> 01:22:33,825
No matter what the
verdict of the court is..

1475
01:22:34,196 --> 01:22:36,255
..the young generation today,
notjust the young..

1476
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:38,891
..but every generation
needs to think like you.

1477
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:39,990
l applaud you.

1478
01:22:40,068 --> 01:22:42,662
Hey, guys. He's my father.

1479
01:22:51,113 --> 01:22:54,810
Sanskrit chants.

1480
01:22:54,883 --> 01:22:56,043
Sanskrit chants.

1481
01:22:56,118 --> 01:22:57,517
Just a minute, priest.

1482
01:22:57,886 --> 01:23:01,481
Explain us the
meaning of these chants.

1483
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:03,890
Priest, your fees is
500 rupees, right.

1484
01:23:03,992 --> 01:23:05,016
We will pay you that.

1485
01:23:05,093 --> 01:23:08,995
We'll pay you 5 rupees for
every mantra you explain.

1486
01:23:09,064 --> 01:23:09,894
Let's go.

1487
01:23:09,998 --> 01:23:11,590
They've seen Kanji
bhai's interview as well.

1488
01:23:11,667 --> 01:23:13,692
Let's go from here, come on.
- Priest.

1489
01:23:15,304 --> 01:23:18,000
Someone placed a big stone
in the middle of the ground.

1490
01:23:18,073 --> 01:23:20,473
And a few people anointed that
stone and adorned it with garlands.

1491
01:23:20,575 --> 01:23:22,372
Now, people call this
the temple of Hanuman..

1492
01:23:22,444 --> 01:23:24,105
..they tie bells here and pray.

1493
01:23:24,212 --> 01:23:27,010
This is the only ground.
Where else can we play?

1494
01:23:27,082 --> 01:23:28,071
lf the BMC doesn't do anything..

1495
01:23:28,183 --> 01:23:30,515
..then we will talk to Kanji bhai..
- Yes, yes..

1496
01:23:30,619 --> 01:23:34,680
No, no. That man spares no one.

1497
01:23:34,856 --> 01:23:36,050
l will move this temple.

1498
01:23:39,795 --> 01:23:42,992
Hail Krishna.

1499
01:23:43,065 --> 01:23:45,863
Hail Krishna.

1500
01:23:46,034 --> 01:23:49,435
Hail Krishna.

1501
01:23:49,671 --> 01:23:52,504
Hail Krishna.

1502
01:23:52,641 --> 01:23:56,236
Hail Krishna.

1503
01:23:56,311 --> 01:23:59,109
Hail Krishna.
- Miracle.

1504
01:23:59,648 --> 01:24:01,775
Swami.
- Yes.

1505
01:24:02,451 --> 01:24:04,248
Relieve me from this hunger-strike.

1506
01:24:04,619 --> 01:24:06,985
Each time l've to go to the
toilet for eating the fritter.

1507
01:24:07,055 --> 01:24:08,579
Manage a few more days..

1508
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:12,084
..otherwise you'll have to
starve for the rest of your life.

1509
01:24:12,728 --> 01:24:15,629
You've rented such a big ground.

1510
01:24:15,697 --> 01:24:17,358
But now nobody comes here.

1511
01:24:17,966 --> 01:24:19,558
The few that are here..

1512
01:24:19,634 --> 01:24:21,158
..are the ones who
rented this dais to us.

1513
01:24:21,503 --> 01:24:24,939
l fear that if people
start believing in Kanji..

1514
01:24:25,073 --> 01:24:26,836
..then they will
lose their faith in us.

1515
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:30,073
What if they stop
coming to the temple?

1516
01:24:30,612 --> 01:24:32,045
That won't happen.

1517
01:24:33,482 --> 01:24:36,212
ln this country,
people visit the temple..

1518
01:24:36,284 --> 01:24:37,945
..more than they visit the school.

1519
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:45,318
The High Court has
accepted 455 cases..

1520
01:24:45,427 --> 01:24:47,987
..but we'll have
to wait and watch..

1521
01:24:48,063 --> 01:24:50,122
..Kanji Lalji Mehta's
argument in the court.

1522
01:24:52,401 --> 01:24:53,663
Siddeshwar Maharaj.

1523
01:24:54,536 --> 01:24:58,199
What's the area of your temple?

1524
01:24:59,541 --> 01:25:00,735
22 acres.

1525
01:25:02,644 --> 01:25:05,204
lt has 322 small temples of God.

1526
01:25:06,248 --> 01:25:09,581
Meaning, there's an entire
shopping mall of Gods inside.

1527
01:25:13,789 --> 01:25:14,778
Silence.

1528
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:20,187
There are 142 priests to serve
the Lord in all these temples.

1529
01:25:20,362 --> 01:25:24,458
Do you know how many
beggars are outside your temple?

1530
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:26,566
What?
- Beggars.

1531
01:25:26,868 --> 01:25:30,998
You remember the 320
idols and 142 priests..

1532
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:36,434
..but you do you know how many
beggars sit outside your temple?

1533
01:25:36,711 --> 01:25:39,737
Your Honour, the beggars
outside their temple..

1534
01:25:39,981 --> 01:25:41,812
..are restricted
from coming inside. No!

1535
01:25:42,217 --> 01:25:44,014
Whether its scorching heat, or
rains, just keep rotting outside.

1536
01:25:44,085 --> 01:25:45,279
Don't set foot inside.

1537
01:25:45,487 --> 01:25:47,387
Don't say no.

1538
01:25:47,456 --> 01:25:49,447
A priest from your
temple told me so.

1539
01:25:50,091 --> 01:25:52,184
And he also said to me..

1540
01:25:52,794 --> 01:25:57,026
..Kanji bhai, if you
want to win this case..

1541
01:25:57,098 --> 01:25:58,656
..then come here every Monday.

1542
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:01,034
So l asked Where should l come.

1543
01:26:01,136 --> 01:26:03,195
He said, Come to
Lord Shiva's temple.

1544
01:26:03,271 --> 01:26:05,865
Offer a bowl of
milk and then watch.

1545
01:26:06,174 --> 01:26:08,608
l thought, fine, let's try it.

1546
01:26:08,944 --> 01:26:10,639
Your Honour, l went
there on a Monday..

1547
01:26:10,779 --> 01:26:14,078
..with a bowl of milk,
standing in the long queue.

1548
01:26:14,182 --> 01:26:16,514
Everyone was holding
bowl in their hands.

1549
01:26:17,385 --> 01:26:19,683
l thought there must be
someone inside to drink the milk.

1550
01:26:19,788 --> 01:26:23,087
All of them aren't fools to
stand in the line holding a jug.

1551
01:26:23,558 --> 01:26:24,422
lt was my turn, Your Honour.

1552
01:26:24,493 --> 01:26:26,484
l went inside, but
there was no in there.

1553
01:26:26,595 --> 01:26:28,392
No one to drink the milk?

1554
01:26:29,231 --> 01:26:31,791
Just then l noticed black stone.

1555
01:26:31,867 --> 01:26:34,165
lt's called 'Shiva's phallus,
you fool.

1556
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:36,466
Yes, there was a 'Shiva's phallus.

1557
01:26:36,571 --> 01:26:38,004
And that stone.

1558
01:26:38,073 --> 01:26:39,836
That stone was
completely immersed in milk.

1559
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:45,168
And right besides the phallus,
through a small drain..

1560
01:26:45,247 --> 01:26:47,442
..the milk was going outside.

1561
01:26:47,516 --> 01:26:50,815
l thought Yes, there must be
someone outside to drink the milk.

1562
01:26:51,219 --> 01:26:52,811
But when l saw there was
no one outside as well.

1563
01:26:53,455 --> 01:26:59,416
All the milk was
going into the sewers.

1564
01:26:59,494 --> 01:27:00,426
The sewers.

1565
01:27:00,529 --> 01:27:01,928
Total waste.

1566
01:27:02,764 --> 01:27:05,665
And there was a beggar
standing right besides the sewer.

1567
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:07,826
He must've been hungry
for the past 4-5 days.

1568
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:09,862
He was shivering.

1569
01:27:10,539 --> 01:27:12,234
Maybe he wanted to drink the milk..

1570
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:13,932
..but he couldn't do
so from the sewers.

1571
01:27:14,242 --> 01:27:16,710
l gave that beggar my bowl of milk.

1572
01:27:17,812 --> 01:27:20,280
And do you know what
he said after he drank the milk?

1573
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:23,381
God bless you!

1574
01:27:30,225 --> 01:27:32,352
lf every person
visiting the temple..

1575
01:27:32,427 --> 01:27:35,954
..gives the milk
to a needy instead..

1576
01:27:36,031 --> 01:27:37,794
..then they will earn more merits.

1577
01:27:37,866 --> 01:27:38,855
Right?

1578
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:47,632
lf you donate
blankets to a poor beggar..

1579
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:52,811
..instead of offering it to shrine,
it will make Allah happy.

1580
01:27:56,217 --> 01:27:59,050
And if you light a candle
in some poor man's hut..

1581
01:27:59,521 --> 01:28:03,355
..instead of the church, they he'll
never have to live in the darkness.

1582
01:28:06,595 --> 01:28:09,894
Don't you believe in God?
- l am God.

1583
01:28:10,465 --> 01:28:12,126
And l am Amitabh Bachchan!

1584
01:28:14,803 --> 01:28:15,895
Look, Kanji.

1585
01:28:17,405 --> 01:28:20,932
Offering milk, candles,
blanket is a tradition.

1586
01:28:21,409 --> 01:28:23,400
Worshipping the Lord.

1587
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,944
But you won't
understand their value..

1588
01:28:28,149 --> 01:28:29,548
..because you are an atheist.

1589
01:28:30,352 --> 01:28:33,185
You're still bounded by
the illusions of this world.

1590
01:28:33,254 --> 01:28:34,653
But you aren't.

1591
01:28:34,789 --> 01:28:37,053
You're at the
threshold of salvation.

1592
01:28:37,158 --> 01:28:40,650
So, why not stop the shams under the
pretext of rituals and traditions?

1593
01:28:41,696 --> 01:28:43,857
Do you know how much oil
is wasted on Saturday..

1594
01:28:43,965 --> 01:28:45,557
..on Lord Shani's idol?

1595
01:28:46,501 --> 01:28:50,904
People stick coins
on the idol like this.

1596
01:28:51,506 --> 01:28:53,474
What will Hanuman do
with all that change?

1597
01:28:53,575 --> 01:28:55,634
Kanji is absolutely right.

1598
01:28:56,511 --> 01:29:00,277
Sai Baba lived in poverty
all his life, for the poor.

1599
01:29:00,749 --> 01:29:02,182
As long as he was alive..

1600
01:29:02,617 --> 01:29:05,780
..he wandered around
for a drop of oil.

1601
01:29:06,221 --> 01:29:07,779
And today, after he's dead.

1602
01:29:08,423 --> 01:29:10,050
Throne worth millions.

1603
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:15,223
Gold crown. What for?

1604
01:29:16,998 --> 01:29:19,228
Tell me one thing.

1605
01:29:20,135 --> 01:29:24,299
Anyone who is a
faithful devotee of the Lord..

1606
01:29:24,706 --> 01:29:28,005
..is blessed with His grace.

1607
01:29:28,176 --> 01:29:29,165
Right?

1608
01:29:30,445 --> 01:29:33,778
Right?
- Yes.

1609
01:29:33,848 --> 01:29:36,908
So tell me,
why does a bus heading..

1610
01:29:37,085 --> 01:29:42,022
..for a trip to Amarnath or
Vaishno Devi falls in the ravine?

1611
01:29:43,058 --> 01:29:44,958
They were going to serve the Lord.

1612
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:48,190
They were going with complete faith
and singing religious discourses.

1613
01:29:48,329 --> 01:29:50,058
So, the Lord called them directly.

1614
01:29:50,465 --> 01:29:53,263
And show me one car
which met with an accident..

1615
01:29:53,334 --> 01:29:56,792
..and doesn't have God's
idol or photo kept inside.

1616
01:29:57,772 --> 01:29:59,467
Speak.
- l object, Your Honour.

1617
01:30:00,675 --> 01:30:04,008
From day 1 this man's
trying to twist the case around.

1618
01:30:04,679 --> 01:30:06,670
Mr. Kanji, this isn't
a debate about good and bad.

1619
01:30:06,915 --> 01:30:08,849
This is the court,
we only believe on proofs here.

1620
01:30:09,217 --> 01:30:12,311
And we have proof, your signatures
on the insurance papers.

1621
01:30:13,221 --> 01:30:14,620
And legally you have no right
to ask for any compensation..

1622
01:30:14,689 --> 01:30:15,713
..from the insurance company.

1623
01:30:15,824 --> 01:30:17,451
And as far as we're concerned.

1624
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:22,058
We don't believe in the
insurance company's conditions.

1625
01:30:23,998 --> 01:30:27,661
lf they say that the
judge caused the earthquake..

1626
01:30:28,002 --> 01:30:29,765
..will the judge have
to pay you compensation?

1627
01:30:29,938 --> 01:30:32,668
Similarly, if God's name
is written on the policy..

1628
01:30:32,907 --> 01:30:35,467
..he isn't liable to
pay the compensation.

1629
01:30:37,645 --> 01:30:39,704
lf you want God to
give you compensation.

1630
01:30:40,415 --> 01:30:42,679
Then prove that God
caused this earthquake.

1631
01:30:43,017 --> 01:30:45,076
He did..
- But, in writing.

1632
01:30:47,355 --> 01:30:49,289
Do you have it...in writing?

1633
01:30:49,958 --> 01:30:51,550
Do you have it? Any proof?

1634
01:30:54,829 --> 01:30:58,287
Your Honour..
- Mr. Kanji, the court of law..

1635
01:30:58,566 --> 01:31:00,557
..cannot give a verdict
on just arguments alone.

1636
01:31:01,569 --> 01:31:06,199
Your arguments maybe
valid for the common people..

1637
01:31:06,708 --> 01:31:11,111
..but if you cannot
prove them, it has no value.

1638
01:31:12,213 --> 01:31:13,646
Do you have any proof?

1639
01:31:17,285 --> 01:31:20,846
No. - ln that case, the
court gives you a month's time..

1640
01:31:20,922 --> 01:31:22,947
..which is your last chance.

1641
01:31:23,892 --> 01:31:26,690
On the next hearing, if you
cannot produce any evidence..

1642
01:31:27,028 --> 01:31:32,125
..then l'm afraid you will have
to rest your case and all others.

1643
01:31:34,302 --> 01:31:35,826
Court is adjourned for the day.

1644
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:39,929
Relax.

1645
01:31:40,842 --> 01:31:42,571
Next time l see you
in this courtroom..

1646
01:31:42,877 --> 01:31:44,970
..l will sue you for defamation,
and you'll lose..

1647
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:46,845
..whatever you have left.

1648
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:49,539
Relax.

1649
01:32:06,801 --> 01:32:09,031
What will you do now? How will
you prove it in the court now?

1650
01:32:09,404 --> 01:32:10,894
Because you're not alone,
Mr. Kanji.

1651
01:32:11,005 --> 01:32:12,472
lt's a matter of crores of rupees.

1652
01:32:12,574 --> 01:32:14,474
Many people have hopes with you.

1653
01:32:14,576 --> 01:32:17,374
Sir, how will you get a proof in writing?
- Sir, what about these people now?

1654
01:32:32,126 --> 01:32:33,855
You aren't playing
your flute today.

1655
01:32:34,629 --> 01:32:36,824
You don't like it,
so l'm sitting quietly.

1656
01:32:37,599 --> 01:32:40,830
l like it. You play it well too.

1657
01:32:41,436 --> 01:32:42,733
Thank you.

1658
01:32:43,338 --> 01:32:45,636
You look worried.
- Yes.

1659
01:32:45,707 --> 01:32:49,302
The court says get us proof,
and in writing.

1660
01:32:49,711 --> 01:32:51,042
How do l get proof?

1661
01:32:51,112 --> 01:32:53,580
There's a consultant sitting
right next to you, ask me.

1662
01:32:55,416 --> 01:32:57,680
This isn't some housing loan issue.

1663
01:32:58,753 --> 01:33:00,015
lt's a court case.

1664
01:33:00,488 --> 01:33:01,420
lt's a big problem.

1665
01:33:01,489 --> 01:33:02,820
l've a suggestion.

1666
01:33:04,792 --> 01:33:05,918
Give me the alcohol.

1667
01:33:07,462 --> 01:33:08,554
You drink this milk.

1668
01:33:09,264 --> 01:33:10,094
You want me to mix them.

1669
01:33:10,198 --> 01:33:12,257
No, no, just drink the milk.

1670
01:33:12,767 --> 01:33:14,291
And l will give you the solution.

1671
01:33:16,804 --> 01:33:19,637
You know, Kanji,
where's the solution..

1672
01:33:19,707 --> 01:33:22,835
..to all the problems,
tensions and trouble written?

1673
01:33:23,177 --> 01:33:25,145
Where?
- ln this book.

1674
01:33:27,415 --> 01:33:28,814
'Shrimad Bhagvad Gita.'

1675
01:33:28,883 --> 01:33:30,874
Have your read it?
- Who can possibly read it?

1676
01:33:30,985 --> 01:33:32,179
lt's such a thick book.

1677
01:33:32,253 --> 01:33:33,515
And not a single photograph.

1678
01:33:33,821 --> 01:33:35,846
How can anyone read it,
it's not interesting at all.

1679
01:33:37,725 --> 01:33:38,987
l used to keep it in my shop.

1680
01:33:39,227 --> 01:33:40,387
But it would fetch a small margin.

1681
01:33:40,662 --> 01:33:42,687
Plus it catches termites.

1682
01:33:42,797 --> 01:33:44,890
lt causes problems.
So l threw it out.

1683
01:33:44,999 --> 01:33:46,227
Threw it?
- Yes, l threw it.

1684
01:33:46,301 --> 01:33:48,064
You threw the Bhagwad Gita out.
- Yes.

1685
01:33:48,136 --> 01:33:49,125
Wow!
- Why?

1686
01:33:51,139 --> 01:33:54,074
Kanji, the Gita,
Bible, Koran has answers..

1687
01:33:54,142 --> 01:33:56,201
..to every problems of humans.

1688
01:33:56,878 --> 01:33:58,903
l know you don't
believe in all this.

1689
01:33:59,681 --> 01:34:03,378
But for your own good,
read this book once.

1690
01:34:05,153 --> 01:34:06,245
And see the result.

1691
01:34:06,587 --> 01:34:08,214
And if the result isn't good..

1692
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:10,321
..then you can throw it out.

1693
01:34:12,393 --> 01:34:15,123
Kanji bhai read it once,
and then see.

1694
01:34:30,445 --> 01:34:35,144
l am not human.

1695
01:34:35,450 --> 01:34:39,113
l am sold in stores.

1696
01:34:40,288 --> 01:34:44,987
l created the world.

1697
01:34:45,259 --> 01:34:49,320
Not with mud,
but with my emotions.

1698
01:34:50,198 --> 01:34:52,530
l am wandering around..

1699
01:34:52,633 --> 01:34:58,401
..looking for my signs,
where are they.

1700
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:03,133
Where are my signs?

1701
01:35:03,211 --> 01:35:05,543
Stop begging in the name of Allah.

1702
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:07,811
Stop begging and do some hard work.

1703
01:35:10,585 --> 01:35:12,610
My signs.

1704
01:35:13,054 --> 01:35:15,545
My signs.

1705
01:35:51,392 --> 01:35:55,852
l was always with
you as your shadow.

1706
01:35:56,230 --> 01:36:01,133
l gave you shade when
the heat was strong.

1707
01:36:01,202 --> 01:36:09,473
l was your
companion in yourjourney.

1708
01:36:10,878 --> 01:36:15,406
Still you're confused.

1709
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:20,210
Looking for your
answers in the question.

1710
01:36:20,688 --> 01:36:24,886
Where are you lost?

1711
01:36:26,761 --> 01:36:31,562
Where are my signs?

1712
01:36:31,632 --> 01:36:36,660
Where are my signs?

1713
01:36:36,771 --> 01:36:38,864
My signs.

1714
01:36:43,644 --> 01:36:46,010
My signs.

1715
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,514
My signs.

1716
01:36:53,421 --> 01:36:55,787
My signs.

1717
01:36:55,857 --> 01:36:58,451
My signs.

1718
01:37:13,007 --> 01:37:14,634
Wear your slippers.
- Oh.

1719
01:37:16,611 --> 01:37:17,635
Thief.

1720
01:37:18,012 --> 01:37:19,377
Those are my slippers.

1721
01:37:20,681 --> 01:37:23,411
Where are my signs?

1722
01:37:23,484 --> 01:37:25,452
Sir, shoe polish.
- No.

1723
01:37:25,553 --> 01:37:27,214
Sir, recognise me.
The beggar outside the shrine.

1724
01:37:27,288 --> 01:37:28,755
You told me to make
an honest living.

1725
01:37:28,823 --> 01:37:30,381
Shake hands, shake hands.

1726
01:37:32,593 --> 01:37:34,185
My signs.

1727
01:37:34,262 --> 01:37:36,560
My signs.

1728
01:37:45,273 --> 01:37:48,037
Today's the last hearing on
the case filed against God.

1729
01:37:48,309 --> 01:37:50,174
The claim amount
is 400 crore rupees.

1730
01:37:50,611 --> 01:37:52,374
Can Kanji bhai win this case?

1731
01:37:52,847 --> 01:37:54,405
We'll have to wait and watch.

1732
01:37:56,684 --> 01:37:58,242
You can please proceed.

1733
01:37:58,819 --> 01:38:01,754
Your Honour,
before Mr. Kanji can express..

1734
01:38:01,923 --> 01:38:04,323
..his sharp and witty
views before the court..

1735
01:38:04,392 --> 01:38:06,986
..without any reference,
l would like to ask..

1736
01:38:07,528 --> 01:38:09,359
..does he have any evidence,
to prove..

1737
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:11,591
..that God has demolished his shop?

1738
01:38:12,466 --> 01:38:16,027
Your Honour,
l require a learned man..

1739
01:38:16,537 --> 01:38:19,836
..for the next
question l'm going to ask.

1740
01:38:20,608 --> 01:38:23,441
So, whoever amongst you is
the learned one can come here.

1741
01:38:24,145 --> 01:38:25,942
The learned one, please come here.

1742
01:38:28,649 --> 01:38:29,980
Please sit down.

1743
01:38:31,652 --> 01:38:34,450
Good. You come here, Swami.

1744
01:38:35,556 --> 01:38:36,545
Come.

1745
01:38:49,437 --> 01:38:53,669
You sages always speak
about the scriptures..

1746
01:38:53,774 --> 01:38:55,264
..in their preaching.

1747
01:38:55,509 --> 01:38:58,307
ls everything written
in the scriptures true?

1748
01:38:58,713 --> 01:38:59,907
Absolutely.

1749
01:39:00,281 --> 01:39:02,272
lt's not written anywhere,
you're saying that.

1750
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:04,212
lt's written in the Gita.

1751
01:39:04,485 --> 01:39:06,646
lt is.
What's written in the Gita?

1752
01:39:07,555 --> 01:39:12,015
Chapter four, verse forty of Gita.

1753
01:39:15,730 --> 01:39:20,667
Sanskrit chants.

1754
01:39:21,602 --> 01:39:26,130
Sanskrit chants.

1755
01:39:26,207 --> 01:39:28,198
Meaning?
- lt means..

1756
01:39:28,476 --> 01:39:35,245
Any illiterate, or faithless
person that doubts the Gita..

1757
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:37,914
..is destined to ruination.

1758
01:39:38,686 --> 01:39:42,816
He stays devoid of
sanctity on earth and on heaven.

1759
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:44,414
Understood?

1760
01:39:46,661 --> 01:39:48,492
He's an interesting character.

1761
01:39:50,498 --> 01:39:56,596
Do you understand anything written
in The Gita or the Scriptures?

1762
01:39:57,071 --> 01:39:59,369
Or are you blindly agreeing..

1763
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,465
..to whatever Leeladhar is saying.

1764
01:40:01,909 --> 01:40:04,241
Your Honour, small
children in school..

1765
01:40:04,312 --> 01:40:05,904
..don't remember the entire prayer.

1766
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:08,405
So they just close
their eyes and...

1767
01:40:08,482 --> 01:40:10,006
Move their lips.

1768
01:40:10,084 --> 01:40:11,847
They move their lips and
you're moving your hands.

1769
01:40:11,919 --> 01:40:13,318
Kanji.

1770
01:40:14,588 --> 01:40:18,718
You've insulted a learned sage.

1771
01:40:18,826 --> 01:40:21,454
So?
- You won't get refuge even in hell.

1772
01:40:21,929 --> 01:40:23,453
How can l?

1773
01:40:24,398 --> 01:40:27,299
You've already
reserved places there.

1774
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,101
How dare you?

1775
01:40:35,142 --> 01:40:36,541
How dare you?

1776
01:40:37,011 --> 01:40:38,706
Atheist!

1777
01:40:41,082 --> 01:40:42,549
Silence.
- Leave me! Leave me!

1778
01:40:42,650 --> 01:40:44,117
What are you doing?

1779
01:40:44,218 --> 01:40:47,119
This is the court, sit down.

1780
01:40:49,123 --> 01:40:51,557
Order, order.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1781
01:40:54,128 --> 01:40:55,527
Sit down everyone.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1782
01:41:01,635 --> 01:41:03,865
Sanskrit chants.

1783
01:41:05,306 --> 01:41:07,274
Sanskrit chants.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1784
01:41:08,008 --> 01:41:10,101
Sanskrit chants.

1785
01:41:10,678 --> 01:41:12,976
Sanskrit chants.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1786
01:41:14,682 --> 01:41:17,082
Chapter 2, verse 56.

1787
01:41:19,487 --> 01:41:24,948
Meaning, a person for whom
happiness and sorrows is equal..

1788
01:41:25,626 --> 01:41:30,893
..and is devoid of anger and fear,
and has a calm mind..

1789
01:41:31,298 --> 01:41:33,266
..is called a learned person.

1790
01:41:39,073 --> 01:41:40,540
They'll teach me Gita?

1791
01:41:41,142 --> 01:41:43,076
They can't teach me, Your Honour.

1792
01:41:43,411 --> 01:41:46,539
Their lQ is lower than
the room temperature.

1793
01:41:49,717 --> 01:41:53,244
l said a few things
to instigate you..

1794
01:41:53,754 --> 01:41:55,221
..you tried to harm me.

1795
01:41:55,489 --> 01:41:58,117
ls this your achievement,
Siddeshwar?

1796
01:41:58,426 --> 01:42:01,589
Mr. Kanji, the issue
isn't his achievement..

1797
01:42:01,662 --> 01:42:03,892
..the issue here is
who razed down your shop?

1798
01:42:04,231 --> 01:42:05,289
God did.

1799
01:42:05,399 --> 01:42:08,459
You're giving a verdict.
That's the judge's duty.

1800
01:42:09,069 --> 01:42:10,900
You just have to prove..

1801
01:42:11,005 --> 01:42:13,303
..that God caused that earthquake.

1802
01:42:13,407 --> 01:42:14,601
Yes, and it's
impossible to prove that.

1803
01:42:14,675 --> 01:42:16,108
Relax, relax, relax.

1804
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:17,837
Nothing is impossible.

1805
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:22,779
Tell me one thing.

1806
01:42:23,217 --> 01:42:26,880
The Lord has narrated the
'Bhagvad Gita'. - Yes.

1807
01:42:26,987 --> 01:42:29,717
And everything said in
the 'Bhagvad Gita' is true.

1808
01:42:30,858 --> 01:42:32,086
Absolutely.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

1809
01:42:32,226 --> 01:42:33,659
Point to be noted, Your Honour.

1810
01:42:34,061 --> 01:42:38,122
So tell me, why did God say in the
eight verse of the ninth chapter..

1811
01:42:38,232 --> 01:42:43,135
..of the 'Gita', l've
created the entire universe..

1812
01:42:43,604 --> 01:42:45,868
..and it will be
destroyed on my will.

1813
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:48,670
The entire creation
follows my will.

1814
01:42:49,243 --> 01:42:52,371
lt is only l, who is responsible..

1815
01:42:52,746 --> 01:42:54,680
..for its creation
and its destruction.

1816
01:42:55,850 --> 01:42:56,839
And look.

1817
01:42:57,518 --> 01:42:59,884
Your Honour, it's been
said in the Bible as well.

1818
01:43:01,088 --> 01:43:03,886
Chapter 54, verse 16.

1819
01:43:06,026 --> 01:43:09,120
See, it is l who have
created the smith..

1820
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:12,456
..who blows the fire of
coals and produces a weapon..

1821
01:43:12,566 --> 01:43:13,897
..fit for his purpose.

1822
01:43:14,368 --> 01:43:18,270
l've also created the
ravager to destroy.

1823
01:43:19,106 --> 01:43:20,266
And see this.

1824
01:43:20,341 --> 01:43:21,899
Also in the Holy Quran.

1825
01:43:22,409 --> 01:43:26,072
Sur-e-Zalzala 99,
verse 108 states that..

1826
01:43:26,447 --> 01:43:29,974
..the entire earth will
be shaken to its core.

1827
01:43:30,451 --> 01:43:34,046
And the earth will
spill out its burden.

1828
01:43:34,321 --> 01:43:37,256
And humans will question,
what's happening.

1829
01:43:37,625 --> 01:43:40,958
And that day, she
will unveil her plight.

1830
01:43:41,195 --> 01:43:45,655
Because the Lord
would've ordered her to do so.

1831
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:46,924
The Lord.

1832
01:43:54,642 --> 01:43:57,509
All these things
mean the same thing..

1833
01:43:58,646 --> 01:44:00,773
..that my shop was razed down..

1834
01:44:00,848 --> 01:44:03,146
..due to the earthquake
caused by God.

1835
01:44:03,217 --> 01:44:06,015
That means it is an act of God.

1836
01:44:06,387 --> 01:44:08,218
lt's His doing.

1837
01:44:08,856 --> 01:44:11,416
And, all those who
have suffered losses..

1838
01:44:11,492 --> 01:44:16,054
..due to Him, will have
to be compensated by God.

1839
01:44:19,967 --> 01:44:22,026
Otherwise, their collection agents.

1840
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:28,203
Your Honour, Mr. Kanji is
trying to confuse Leeladhar..

1841
01:44:28,275 --> 01:44:29,367
..with his words.

1842
01:44:29,443 --> 01:44:30,432
Mr. Sardesai.

1843
01:44:31,478 --> 01:44:33,537
What are you doing?
Let him speak.

1844
01:44:33,747 --> 01:44:36,011
lf it's proven that God exists..

1845
01:44:36,183 --> 01:44:37,844
..then we won't have to pay.

1846
01:44:37,918 --> 01:44:39,180
l see.

1847
01:44:40,054 --> 01:44:42,921
Now you want to blame us completely.
- Be quiet.

1848
01:44:43,023 --> 01:44:45,924
You cannot blame the Lord
to hide your sins. - Be quiet.

1849
01:44:46,026 --> 01:44:48,517
Because only we have
a copyright on God.

1850
01:44:48,629 --> 01:44:50,062
Copyright?
- Silence.

1851
01:44:50,130 --> 01:44:51,825
Just because you
constructed a few temples..

1852
01:44:51,899 --> 01:44:53,298
..you think God belongs to you..

1853
01:44:53,801 --> 01:44:54,859
Beware.

1854
01:44:55,202 --> 01:44:57,067
Our community won't spare you.

1855
01:44:57,137 --> 01:44:58,434
What's he..
- Silence!

1856
01:44:58,505 --> 01:44:59,699
Relax.

1857
01:45:01,275 --> 01:45:05,735
Until today l had heard
that God is venerated..

1858
01:45:05,813 --> 01:45:08,373
..He is worshipped, prayed to.

1859
01:45:08,949 --> 01:45:12,885
But now l see that
Gods have copyrights too.

1860
01:45:15,756 --> 01:45:17,417
God's copyright?

1861
01:45:17,491 --> 01:45:19,982
These people have
turned God into a brand.

1862
01:45:21,495 --> 01:45:25,761
Now l am assured
that God doesn't exist.

1863
01:45:26,467 --> 01:45:27,456
Not possible.

1864
01:45:27,968 --> 01:45:29,833
Because if He really existed..

1865
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:33,367
..he would've rid
the world of imposters like you.

1866
01:45:34,308 --> 01:45:37,971
l've already proven what
l wanted to, Your Honour.

1867
01:45:38,646 --> 01:45:40,614
Now the verdict..

1868
01:45:47,021 --> 01:45:48,784
Mr. Kanji, are you alright?

1869
01:45:49,690 --> 01:45:52,921
Mr. kanji, are you alright?

1870
01:45:54,228 --> 01:45:55,217
Mr. Kanji.

1871
01:45:55,295 --> 01:45:57,024
Kanji bhai! Kanji bhai!

1872
01:45:57,097 --> 01:45:58,621
Kanji bhai! Kanji bhai!

1873
01:45:58,699 --> 01:46:00,758
What's wrong with my brother?

1874
01:46:00,868 --> 01:46:02,563
Someone get water.

1875
01:46:03,037 --> 01:46:04,766
Kanji bhai! Kanji bhai!

1876
01:46:06,006 --> 01:46:07,132
Thank you.
- Call the ambulance.

1877
01:46:07,207 --> 01:46:08,469
Call the ambulance.

1878
01:46:17,184 --> 01:46:18,412
Yes, he's here.

1879
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:20,209
Excuse me.
- Just a minute, just a minute.

1880
01:46:20,287 --> 01:46:23,620
Let me through.
- Please let us pass.

1881
01:46:23,824 --> 01:46:25,655
You cannot go inside.
- No, no, no.

1882
01:46:25,759 --> 01:46:28,023
Please, l said you cannot..
- But he's my husband.

1883
01:46:28,095 --> 01:46:29,392
l want to see him.

1884
01:46:31,999 --> 01:46:34,991
Doctor, is he alright?

1885
01:46:35,636 --> 01:46:37,263
lt's a severe attack of paralysis.

1886
01:46:37,504 --> 01:46:38,903
And now he's gone into coma.

1887
01:46:58,726 --> 01:47:00,284
He's on ventilator and..

1888
01:47:00,961 --> 01:47:02,792
..only God can save him now.

1889
01:47:15,876 --> 01:47:18,174
The 400 crore in compensations
under the 'Act of God'..

1890
01:47:18,245 --> 01:47:19,735
..will now be paid out.

1891
01:47:19,813 --> 01:47:22,941
lt was his wish that
we should pay, so we did.

1892
01:47:23,350 --> 01:47:25,750
Great, Lord.

1893
01:48:14,868 --> 01:48:16,335
Where am l?

1894
01:48:17,471 --> 01:48:18,631
Don't say that.

1895
01:48:21,742 --> 01:48:22,970
You're in the lCU.

1896
01:48:23,443 --> 01:48:25,070
Your wife and children are outside.

1897
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:27,943
No one's allowed inside.

1898
01:48:29,683 --> 01:48:31,048
Then how did you come in?

1899
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:34,819
l came here to wake you up.

1900
01:48:37,991 --> 01:48:39,788
lt's time for you to get up.

1901
01:48:46,466 --> 01:48:48,491
You cussed God from your heart.

1902
01:48:50,470 --> 01:48:51,960
And where's the heart?

1903
01:48:52,472 --> 01:48:53,769
On your left.

1904
01:48:54,441 --> 01:48:57,706
So God has paralysed
your entire left side.

1905
01:48:59,980 --> 01:49:02,505
l am not saying this..

1906
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:07,516
..it's the media outside
spreading this rumour.

1907
01:49:08,722 --> 01:49:11,919
l can cure you if you want.

1908
01:49:13,026 --> 01:49:14,857
So, you're a doctor now.

1909
01:49:15,529 --> 01:49:16,996
l am all in one.

1910
01:49:17,798 --> 01:49:19,629
Want to see a miracle.

1911
01:49:21,802 --> 01:49:27,672
Soaring around on the
bike isn't called miracle.

1912
01:49:27,875 --> 01:49:28,864
l see.

1913
01:49:31,144 --> 01:49:32,168
Here we go.

1914
01:50:19,726 --> 01:50:23,321
Krishna Vasudev Yadav, from Gokul.

1915
01:50:27,267 --> 01:50:28,666
Do you believe now?

1916
01:50:37,077 --> 01:50:40,240
You're my mother, and my father.

1917
01:50:40,547 --> 01:50:43,880
You're my friend,
and my companion.

1918
01:50:44,318 --> 01:50:46,445
l've donned the same
form you always see..

1919
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:50,786
..on televisions,
calendars, movies.

1920
01:50:51,258 --> 01:50:53,317
l've been seen in
this form for ages.

1921
01:50:53,427 --> 01:50:55,224
And l'm standing before
you in that same form.

1922
01:50:57,965 --> 01:51:01,492
But Kanji bhai, l'm not like that.

1923
01:51:03,770 --> 01:51:04,862
You really..

1924
01:51:06,473 --> 01:51:09,465
Forgive me, forgive me.

1925
01:51:10,377 --> 01:51:13,039
Just like a devotee is
incomplete without his God..

1926
01:51:14,614 --> 01:51:19,551
..similarly, God is incomplete
without his true devotee.

1927
01:51:26,259 --> 01:51:28,727
Why didn't you show me
this miracle before?

1928
01:51:31,398 --> 01:51:32,660
That's the problem.

1929
01:51:35,736 --> 01:51:36,725
Friend.

1930
01:51:38,105 --> 01:51:40,232
l am Krishna,
that's why l perform miracles.

1931
01:51:41,942 --> 01:51:45,503
l'm not Krishna,
because l perform miracles.

1932
01:51:47,347 --> 01:51:48,609
That means you're real.

1933
01:51:49,483 --> 01:51:50,745
God exists.

1934
01:51:51,318 --> 01:51:55,220
And God isn't my father-figure,
he's my friend.

1935
01:51:55,288 --> 01:52:00,225
l am everyone's friend,
but no one understands me one.

1936
01:52:00,494 --> 01:52:02,155
People gave you a high position.

1937
01:52:02,529 --> 01:52:04,053
And you staggered.

1938
01:52:04,831 --> 01:52:07,800
Yes, but l am not
like people think of me.

1939
01:52:09,036 --> 01:52:10,401
l've common sense too.

1940
01:52:11,304 --> 01:52:16,298
l am not interested
in people's offerings.

1941
01:52:16,610 --> 01:52:19,670
l want them to
distribute all this to the poor.

1942
01:52:20,414 --> 01:52:25,181
All l care about is their faith,
their love, their belief.

1943
01:52:25,252 --> 01:52:26,514
Just a minute.

1944
01:52:27,287 --> 01:52:28,276
Belief?

1945
01:52:28,822 --> 01:52:30,619
But l never believed in You.

1946
01:52:31,224 --> 01:52:32,555
l was an atheist.

1947
01:52:33,193 --> 01:52:34,820
Why did You show
yourself to only me?

1948
01:52:35,695 --> 01:52:36,923
Kanji bhai, sit down.

1949
01:52:44,304 --> 01:52:45,703
Do you know what atheist means?

1950
01:52:47,741 --> 01:52:50,437
Someone who examines, thinks,
understands..

1951
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:52,102
..and says that this is wrong.

1952
01:52:52,512 --> 01:52:53,638
The Lord doesn't exist.

1953
01:52:53,713 --> 01:52:55,943
He's an atheist.

1954
01:52:56,249 --> 01:52:57,807
That's why l appeared before you.

1955
01:52:58,318 --> 01:53:01,185
Because you did
everything a true atheist does.

1956
01:53:01,455 --> 01:53:05,016
And a true atheist can
become a real believer.

1957
01:53:05,659 --> 01:53:08,219
People come to me for
their own self-interest.

1958
01:53:08,995 --> 01:53:11,225
They come with
different exchange offers.

1959
01:53:11,498 --> 01:53:12,795
Exchange offer?

1960
01:53:13,467 --> 01:53:15,298
Lord, if l pass my SSC exams..

1961
01:53:15,402 --> 01:53:17,370
..l will walk to
Siddhivinayak for 5 Tuesdays.

1962
01:53:18,772 --> 01:53:22,902
lf Dominic's agrees to marry me..

1963
01:53:23,477 --> 01:53:26,605
..l will light 1 1 candles
at Mt. Mary.

1964
01:53:27,314 --> 01:53:30,078
lf my wife gets pregnant..

1965
01:53:30,183 --> 01:53:32,481
..then l will come and
offer a blanket at your shrine.

1966
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:34,519
Different offers.

1967
01:53:35,388 --> 01:53:38,983
And those who can't
blame me for it.

1968
01:53:39,726 --> 01:53:41,660
They say, we couldn't go there..

1969
01:53:41,728 --> 01:53:43,457
..because the Lord didn't call us.

1970
01:53:44,464 --> 01:53:45,988
The Lord didn't call?

1971
01:53:46,199 --> 01:53:47,325
Do they need a invitation card..
- Yes.

1972
01:53:47,434 --> 01:53:48,992
Do you want me to write
you an invitation card?

1973
01:53:49,336 --> 01:53:51,201
Don't l have anything better to do?

1974
01:53:51,838 --> 01:53:54,636
And anyway, Kanji bhai,
l am present in every element.

1975
01:53:55,075 --> 01:53:56,269
l am omnipresent.

1976
01:53:56,343 --> 01:53:57,901
lf you're present everywhere..

1977
01:53:58,011 --> 01:53:59,478
..why have they built temples?

1978
01:53:59,546 --> 01:54:01,411
l've my own house.

1979
01:54:01,848 --> 01:54:04,043
l don't want to live
inside those four walls.

1980
01:54:04,251 --> 01:54:07,243
Then? Why did you
create such a religion?

1981
01:54:07,454 --> 01:54:09,581
l only created humans.

1982
01:54:09,789 --> 01:54:12,849
And humans started religion, caste.

1983
01:54:13,026 --> 01:54:15,085
And it's been going
on for years now..

1984
01:54:15,195 --> 01:54:17,493
..because you need it.

1985
01:54:17,597 --> 01:54:19,656
But one should
discard such a religion.

1986
01:54:21,234 --> 01:54:23,668
Never snatch the religion
from the people.

1987
01:54:24,204 --> 01:54:28,971
lf you take them away,
they will make you their religion.

1988
01:54:31,011 --> 01:54:32,535
You don't believe it, do you?

1989
01:54:36,349 --> 01:54:38,317
You've been in coma for a month.

1990
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:41,778
Let me show you what has happened..

1991
01:54:41,888 --> 01:54:43,480
..in the past one month.

1992
01:54:44,524 --> 01:54:45,616
Look.

1993
01:54:47,227 --> 01:54:50,219
Kanji Prabhu paid me
a visit in my dreams yesterday.

1994
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:55,825
And he said he's
the 1 1th Avatar of Lord Vishnu.

1995
01:54:55,936 --> 01:54:57,233
What's going on?

1996
01:54:58,572 --> 01:55:01,735
Kanji Prabhu appeared
in his four-armed form.

1997
01:55:02,842 --> 01:55:06,209
Holding the mace, the conch..

1998
01:55:07,581 --> 01:55:09,378
People all around the world..

1999
01:55:09,482 --> 01:55:11,347
..are seeing signs
of Kanji's Godly form.

2000
01:55:11,451 --> 01:55:13,043
l was on night duty.

2001
01:55:13,119 --> 01:55:14,746
Ajust closed my eyes.

2002
01:55:14,854 --> 01:55:17,186
And someone slapped me.

2003
01:55:17,390 --> 01:55:20,882
And that's when l heard a voice,
No sleeping on duty.

2004
01:55:20,961 --> 01:55:23,725
Circulate a few miraculous
stories of Kanji in the market..

2005
01:55:24,164 --> 01:55:25,961
..and people will
spread it like wildfire.

2006
01:55:26,499 --> 01:55:30,731
l had seen Kanji Prabhu
flying with his scooter.

2007
01:55:30,804 --> 01:55:32,328
He appeared suddenly.

2008
01:55:32,572 --> 01:55:34,597
10 feet, 15 feet, 20 feet.

2009
01:55:34,774 --> 01:55:36,139
Brother Kanji is God.

2010
01:55:36,409 --> 01:55:37,398
He is God.

2011
01:55:38,545 --> 01:55:41,343
The 'dharma gurus' have accepted
Kanji bhai's Kalki avatar..

2012
01:55:41,414 --> 01:55:43,473
..asked for an
apology and have decided..

2013
01:55:43,550 --> 01:55:46,178
..to pay the claims
worth 400 crore.

2014
01:55:46,586 --> 01:55:50,522
lt was His will that we
should pay, so we did.

2015
01:55:50,657 --> 01:55:52,352
But why are you making him God?

2016
01:55:52,425 --> 01:55:53,949
Who told you that he is God?

2017
01:55:54,027 --> 01:55:58,020
Do you know...when you will die?

2018
01:55:58,965 --> 01:56:00,523
Do you?
- No.

2019
01:56:01,101 --> 01:56:02,830
l don't know either.

2020
01:56:04,104 --> 01:56:08,939
But he has decided his death day.

2021
01:56:11,244 --> 01:56:14,179
On 16th December as soon as
we switch off the ventilator..

2022
01:56:14,281 --> 01:56:15,748
..Kanji's story will be over.

2023
01:56:16,316 --> 01:56:18,511
But this time we've
incurred heavy losses.

2024
01:56:19,085 --> 01:56:20,882
400 crores in insurance claims.

2025
01:56:20,954 --> 01:56:22,182
One crore to the doctor.

2026
01:56:22,289 --> 01:56:24,189
And the expense to
construct the temple.

2027
01:56:24,291 --> 01:56:26,384
lt's a onetime investment,
Mr. Mishra.

2028
01:56:26,493 --> 01:56:28,688
We'll recover it in a year.

2029
01:56:28,995 --> 01:56:34,399
And anyway, we haven't had
a new God for a long time now.

2030
01:56:38,371 --> 01:56:42,171
Hail Lord Kanji Wala.

2031
01:56:42,609 --> 01:56:46,909
Hail Lord Kanji Wala.

2032
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:51,774
Om Lord Kanji Wala.

2033
01:56:52,619 --> 01:56:57,147
Sugar's high,
feeling breathless too.

2034
01:56:57,424 --> 01:57:01,656
Cure my swine flu.
- Cure my swine flu.

2035
01:57:02,696 --> 01:57:05,563
l am going.
- Mahadev, wait.

2036
01:57:05,665 --> 01:57:07,428
Where are you going so hastily?

2037
01:57:07,567 --> 01:57:08,898
Forsake your anger.

2038
01:57:09,436 --> 01:57:11,961
The bed besides
Kanji bhai is empty.

2039
01:57:13,373 --> 01:57:14,897
Do you want me to
reserve that for you?

2040
01:57:14,974 --> 01:57:20,173
He will forsake his
body on his birthday.

2041
01:57:22,148 --> 01:57:27,518
His shrine will be built
right where his shop was.

2042
01:57:27,687 --> 01:57:29,678
That isn't all. Now watch this.

2043
01:57:30,323 --> 01:57:33,087
All arrangements to transport
Kanji bhai's tomb has been made.

2044
01:57:33,226 --> 01:57:34,955
You snatched their business..

2045
01:57:35,061 --> 01:57:37,188
..and they made you their business.

2046
01:57:37,764 --> 01:57:38,594
Yes.

2047
01:57:38,698 --> 01:57:41,724
Kanji bhai,
they've made an estimate..

2048
01:57:41,801 --> 01:57:46,397
..to earn 450 crores
from your temple.

2049
01:57:46,773 --> 01:57:49,503
You're God, you
should've stopped them.

2050
01:57:49,576 --> 01:57:52,306
Friend, l would've ended the
battle of Mahabharat in a second..

2051
01:57:52,379 --> 01:57:53,710
..if l had picked up the weapon.

2052
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:55,179
But that isn't my job.

2053
01:57:55,415 --> 01:57:58,475
My job is to show
people right and wrong.

2054
01:57:58,718 --> 01:58:00,413
This is your temple, your battle.

2055
01:58:00,487 --> 01:58:02,421
You decide what you should do.

2056
01:58:02,722 --> 01:58:06,351
Fight if you want to,
or stay quiet.

2057
01:58:17,303 --> 01:58:18,827
Save him, please doctor.

2058
01:58:18,905 --> 01:58:20,566
We cannot do anything now.

2059
01:58:21,141 --> 01:58:23,769
And anyway, it's his last wish.

2060
01:58:23,877 --> 01:58:26,141
He is God.

2061
01:58:27,881 --> 01:58:29,246
Just a minute.

2062
01:58:29,315 --> 01:58:31,749
Wait here, we'll
bring the dead body out.

2063
01:58:36,790 --> 01:58:41,250
Donate as much as you wish in the donation
box kept in front of Kanji Prabhu..

2064
01:58:41,361 --> 01:58:43,488
..and have your wishes fulfilled.

2065
01:58:45,865 --> 01:58:49,392
The rate for VlP line is Rs. 101 .

2066
01:58:49,502 --> 01:58:51,663
Welcome, welcome, Mahadev.

2067
01:58:52,872 --> 01:58:55,932
Swami, our very own Mahadeveshwar.

2068
01:58:56,943 --> 01:58:58,808
This is called destiny.

2069
01:58:58,945 --> 01:59:03,473
Kanji's chapter's going to
end right where it started.

2070
01:59:14,994 --> 01:59:17,292
Kanji bhai's body has gone
missing from the hospital.

2071
01:59:17,764 --> 01:59:20,892
The hospital
administration has no explanation.

2072
01:59:21,301 --> 01:59:24,236
Offerings made in
clarified butter, only Rs.25.

2073
01:59:24,304 --> 01:59:26,499
Where did Kanji disappear to?

2074
01:59:28,641 --> 01:59:30,905
Call Mr. Mishra.

2075
01:59:32,312 --> 01:59:33,404
There he is.

2076
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:35,539
He isn't Spiderman. Find him.

2077
01:59:37,016 --> 01:59:39,678
l just found out. Don't worry.

2078
01:59:39,786 --> 01:59:41,754
l am there. l'll do something.

2079
01:59:42,522 --> 01:59:47,926
Kanji Prabhu's dead body can arrive
in the truck anytime now. - Go on.

2080
01:59:48,294 --> 01:59:53,891
Everyone please keep calm, everyone
will get a chance to behold him.

2081
01:59:54,934 --> 01:59:57,334
photographs of Sri Kanji Prabhu.

2082
01:59:57,437 --> 02:00:01,737
Kanji Prabhu's autobiography.

2083
02:00:13,353 --> 02:00:15,878
You are a fool.

2084
02:00:15,955 --> 02:00:17,684
l gave orders and you
set out to look for Kanji.

2085
02:00:17,757 --> 02:00:19,019
Who do you think he is?

2086
02:00:20,193 --> 02:00:21,626
Let's get out of here quietly,
otherwise..

2087
02:00:21,694 --> 02:00:23,059
..the people won't spare us.

2088
02:00:23,129 --> 02:00:24,221
Come on.

2089
02:00:45,084 --> 02:00:46,711
Kanji is alive.

2090
02:00:50,390 --> 02:00:51,721
Yes, l am alive.

2091
02:00:57,196 --> 02:00:58,788
What are you staring at?

2092
02:00:59,299 --> 02:01:03,292
l am the same Kanji whom
you've turned into God.

2093
02:01:04,037 --> 02:01:06,597
l don't know whether
you're great or fool.

2094
02:01:07,206 --> 02:01:10,801
l kept telling you don't
turn religion into business..

2095
02:01:10,877 --> 02:01:14,836
..you made him God and
started your business.

2096
02:01:16,349 --> 02:01:17,941
Tell me one thing.

2097
02:01:18,051 --> 02:01:22,078
The world's so beautiful, why
should God live only in temples?

2098
02:01:23,289 --> 02:01:25,484
l say, have faith in Him.

2099
02:01:25,925 --> 02:01:28,485
Believe in Him from your heart
and you will find God.

2100
02:01:29,228 --> 02:01:31,890
Try to find God in humans,
and you will find Him.

2101
02:01:31,965 --> 02:01:33,865
You will find Him in humans.

2102
02:01:34,267 --> 02:01:35,928
Not in these stones.

2103
02:01:37,370 --> 02:01:39,861
Not in these...stones.

2104
02:01:49,182 --> 02:01:51,514
They played with our emotions.

2105
02:01:51,584 --> 02:01:52,846
We won't spare them!

2106
02:01:52,919 --> 02:01:53,977
We won't spare them!

2107
02:01:54,087 --> 02:01:55,714
They spread the rumour
of your death as well.

2108
02:01:55,788 --> 02:01:57,346
They are the imposters.

2109
02:01:57,457 --> 02:01:58,981
Listen.

2110
02:01:59,559 --> 02:02:02,460
You kill two and there
are two hundred more.

2111
02:02:02,595 --> 02:02:04,426
Don't you see it on
television everyday?

2112
02:02:04,597 --> 02:02:06,861
Their real punishment is..

2113
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:09,359
..let them leave respectfully.

2114
02:02:10,803 --> 02:02:13,795
Let them leave in
their expensive cars.

2115
02:02:13,873 --> 02:02:19,368
And no one will set foot in
their temples or hermitages.

2116
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:20,668
Get that.

2117
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:23,105
That will be their real punishment.

2118
02:02:24,150 --> 02:02:25,481
Please leave.

2119
02:02:52,845 --> 02:02:58,477
Faith and belief, are
very addictive, Kanji.

2120
02:02:59,919 --> 02:03:04,322
Once you're addicted to it,
you cannot let go easily.

2121
02:03:05,091 --> 02:03:07,025
All the people that you see here..

2122
02:03:08,127 --> 02:03:12,928
..they are not God-loving people,
they are God-fearing.

2123
02:03:13,666 --> 02:03:17,693
Sooner or later, you might
see them in hermitages again.

2124
02:03:21,541 --> 02:03:22,633
Be fearless!

2125
02:03:33,953 --> 02:03:37,684
So...won't you go along?

2126
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:40,717
Come on, break the idol.

2127
02:03:41,961 --> 02:03:43,826
Papa.
- Where? Where is he?

2128
02:03:43,896 --> 02:03:49,095
l want you to promise that no
one will ever drop a penny..

2129
02:03:49,168 --> 02:03:50,726
..at any of the religious places.

2130
02:03:55,908 --> 02:03:57,170
What are you staring at?

2131
02:03:57,276 --> 02:03:58,743
Break the statue.

2132
02:04:13,793 --> 02:04:16,921
Here, come here.
- Come, l'll introduce you to Krishna.

2133
02:04:17,029 --> 02:04:19,520
What?
- Come that way.

2134
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:26,934
Look, Kanji bhai,
they're felling the statue.

2135
02:04:32,011 --> 02:04:33,911
lt's exactly like you wanted.

2136
02:04:35,214 --> 02:04:36,203
Look..

2137
02:04:56,068 --> 02:04:57,763
Who are you looking for, Kanji?

2138
02:05:00,573 --> 02:05:02,632
Didn't l say l am
present everywhere?

2139
02:05:03,376 --> 02:05:05,469
l am pouring on fields as the rain.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

2140
02:05:06,412 --> 02:05:08,812
And making nests
along with the birds.

2141
02:05:09,549 --> 02:05:12,313
l am also taking lunch
with the ants down there.

2142
02:05:19,458 --> 02:05:20,982
Are you fine?
- Papa.

2143
02:05:21,627 --> 02:05:22,855
Yes, l am fine.

2144
02:05:23,029 --> 02:05:24,826
Whom did you want
us to introduce to?

2145
02:05:28,534 --> 02:05:29,523
No one.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

2146
02:05:30,336 --> 02:05:31,325
No one.

2147
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:35,598
What are you doing, Kanji?

2148
02:05:36,375 --> 02:05:38,707
Don't wear this around
your neck as a talisman.

2149
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:42,307
You finally succeeded
in explaining people..

2150
02:05:42,415 --> 02:05:43,882
..that this is wrong.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

2151
02:05:44,283 --> 02:05:45,272
Throw it.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

2152
02:05:46,252 --> 02:05:47,446
Throw it away.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>
