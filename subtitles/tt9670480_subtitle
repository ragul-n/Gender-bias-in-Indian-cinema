1
00:03:29,472 --> 00:03:30,472
Hello sir.

2
00:04:21,597 --> 00:04:23,139
Gani is here.

3
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:28,633
He let Abhilash go...

4
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,271
But Abhilash wants us to kill him.

5
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:11,555
Abhi!

6
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,264
He’s dead.

7
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:15,305
Bujjamma is all yours now...

8
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:17,245
And Gaddalakonda is mine.

9
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:27,430
Cinema!

10
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:30,097
Cinema is like the skies.

11
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,889
Cinema is an opportunity.

12
00:05:32,305 --> 00:05:33,514
Cinema is happiness.

13
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:35,305
Cinema is an experience.

14
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:36,847
Cinema is victory.

15
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:38,472
Cinema is change.

16
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,115
Cinema is a cigarette that's lit up.

17
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:42,948
Cinema is like a black ticket.

18
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,014
Cinema is tears.

19
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:46,722
Cinema is poetry.

20
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,472
Cinema is a puzzle.

21
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:50,722
Cinema is...

22
00:05:51,838 --> 00:05:52,713
A whistle!

23
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,478
That was superb! Take okay.

24
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,297
-Superb shot, sir!
-Thank you.

25
00:05:58,118 --> 00:06:00,368
Brother, people usually
expect comedy from me.

26
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:02,407
Why'd you choose the serious stuff?

27
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:06,131
I believe you can deliver any emotion.

28
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:08,065
Very daring statement!

29
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:10,730
-Thank you!
-Sir, the director is coming.

30
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:12,336
-Please get ready.
-Okay.

31
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:19,055
Abhi! That was a superb shot.

32
00:06:19,264 --> 00:06:20,305
Hey, thanks!

33
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,019
Alright, guys. Let’s get back to work.

34
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:23,232
Director will be here soon.

35
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:24,554
I'm already here...

36
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:26,457
It’s time for you to leave the set.

37
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:32,597
Another word and I’ll slap you!

38
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:35,516
Do you get what’s going on here, Producer?

39
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:37,950
I asked him to prep for the shot
and he’s shooting a short film.

40
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:39,764
You don’t fit in as an Assistant Director.

41
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,472
What makes you think you can be a Director?

42
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,472
We’re making a big budget film here...

43
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,097
And you’re shooting a short film
on the side.

44
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,722
Sounds like a new concept to me.

45
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,780
First apologize to the Director.

46
00:06:49,722 --> 00:06:50,930
A coffee for Director!

47
00:06:51,992 --> 00:06:52,992
Sir, Take it.

48
00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:54,260
Please take it.

49
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:55,430
Just relax.

50
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,680
Please!

51
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:02,896
It was a mistake, sir.

52
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:04,501
I’ll never repeat this again.

53
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:05,722
I’m...

54
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:07,229
Sorry.

55
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,182
I’m also sorry.

56
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:10,961
You’re sorry? Why, sir?

57
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:12,422
For this!

58
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,218
This generation feels they can get away
with anything with an apology.

59
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:29,876
Spot boy!

60
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:31,930
Bring me tea as well.

61
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:40,680
One is considered lucky to get
a cup of tea in this industry.

62
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:43,639
Don’t belittle what’s handed to you.

63
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,135
Good luck and goodbye!

64
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:55,216
You get to see a loser preach life lessons
only in this industry.

65
00:07:56,364 --> 00:07:58,114
Losers who shut the clapboard today

66
00:07:58,193 --> 00:07:59,985
are also the top directors of the future.

67
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:03,101
I will say this loud and clear...

68
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:06,015
I will become a director within a year.

69
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:08,847
I will make a good film.

70
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:09,744
I'll be watching you...

71
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,139
Let me see how you’ll become a Director.

72
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:13,639
That’s exactly what I mean, sir.

73
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:15,764
You’ll witness me becoming a Director.

74
00:08:16,926 --> 00:08:18,259
You will see it for sure.

75
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,847
Damn it!

76
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,847
Being a top journalist,
I killed my pride...

77
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,139
Went out of my way to review that
director's films, just to get you in.

78
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,430
Look what he's done, uncle.

79
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:33,680
What did I do?

80
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,889
Uncle got you chance to learn direction...

81
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:37,545
You weren’t supposed to shoot there.

82
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:39,430
Forget it. Your academics are good.

83
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:41,597
Move to America and find a job.

84
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:46,643
He’s right...
Find a secure job and settle down.

85
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:50,426
Settling down is not my priority.

86
00:08:50,987 --> 00:08:52,612
I want to live a happy life.

87
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,158
Wow! Is that one of the punch lines
from your film?

88
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:57,297
I don’t get the sense. Can you elaborate?

89
00:08:57,422 --> 00:08:59,463
Making good money helps you settle down.

90
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,210
But doing what you
love makes you happy.

91
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:04,278
Well said!

92
00:09:04,362 --> 00:09:06,945
I always knew you were talented.
But I loved what you did back there.

93
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,329
Mom and dad, this is my Producer.

94
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:10,722
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, ma’am.

95
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:13,014
I watched your short film a while ago.

96
00:09:13,305 --> 00:09:15,930
You snuck behind our backs and
shot it without any resources.

97
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:18,686
I wondered what you’d do
with a little support.

98
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:20,347
I will make a film with you.

99
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:21,752
Take the advance...

100
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:23,389
1,16,000 rupees.

101
00:09:24,722 --> 00:09:26,097
How can I ever repay you?

102
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,326
By giving me a blockbuster film.

103
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,139
Which hero do you have in mind?

104
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:30,972
I’ll stalk him for dates.

105
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,097
There are number of directors
who write scripts for a hero.

106
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,159
But this time, I wrote a story
with the villain in mind.

107
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:39,568
So there’s no protagonist in our film?
- There is, sir.

108
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:41,805
In my film, my villain is...

109
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:44,168
My hero!

110
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,121
I don’t want to mess with you...
You can watch...

111
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,493
I’m done with you.

112
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:03,994
Sir didn't miss any character...

113
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:07,409
He made films on terrorists
and ordinary men.

114
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,805
What do we do now?

115
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,652
A retired don in a farmhouse is boring..

116
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,055
We should find a gangster in action.

117
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,014
In that case, we should meet your uncle.

118
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:23,719
Why do you want to make films
on criminals and glorify them?

119
00:10:23,805 --> 00:10:25,639
Filmmakers like you are spoiling
the society...

120
00:10:25,764 --> 00:10:28,347
Being a journalist,
how could you encourage this?

121
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,430
If only he listened, I wouldn’t have
had to come to you.

122
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,540
Attenborough’s Gandhi was a hit film
worldwide.

123
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,180
Did that turn us into Gandhi?

124
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:40,870
Films like Bharateeyudu and Tagore
didn’t stop people from taking bribes...

125
00:10:41,097 --> 00:10:42,514
Films don’t influence you, sir.

126
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:43,863
It entertains you.

127
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:46,372
I don’t have the intellect
to educate people...

128
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:48,547
So I’m trying entertain them.

129
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:49,420
Good!

130
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:51,751
I know a guy Vetapalem Veerraju.

131
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:54,704
Vetapalem Veerraju!

132
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,072
Wow!

133
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:09,474
What a scene!
I enter the village and...

134
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,264
Boom! A dead body pops up.

135
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:13,264
What a frame! What a shot!

136
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:16,086
Vetapalem seems to be on a roll.

137
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,097
Excuse me. Did Veerraju kill someone?

138
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:23,844
Veerraju has been murdered.

139
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,097
- Bro…
- Yes…

140
00:11:30,427 --> 00:11:32,242
He was supposed to shine
on the silver screen...

141
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,324
But he is on the pyre now.

142
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:36,489
Poor Veerraju!

143
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,238
He’s dead before watching his Biopic.

144
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:39,827
Rest in peace!

145
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:42,264
What are you thinking?

146
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:44,264
You’re thinking about the guy who is dead.

147
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,472
But I’m thinking about the guy who killed.

148
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:49,768
He killed a wicked man like Veerraju.

149
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:53,264
He is very dangerous.

150
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:04,350
Excuse me. What’s the chaos
at the police station?

151
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:06,938
They caught Vetapalem Veerraju’s murderer...

152
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:09,771
His men are demanding to release him.

153
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:12,389
He’s is not the murderer...

154
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:15,930
He’s a mad hermit who witnessed
Vetapalem Veerraju’s murder.

155
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,913
We arrested him to keep him away
from the raging crowd.

156
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,789
Buddy... He looks like an Aghora.

157
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:38,139
Hello!

158
00:12:39,222 --> 00:12:40,139
Master.

159
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:42,972
Hello... Hello...

160
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:44,344
Uncle Beardy!

161
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,264
He’s useless...
I guess he’s really crazy.

162
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:50,358
Sir...

163
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:52,706
Who murdered Vetapalem Veerraju?

164
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,264
Err... How does he look?

165
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:58,213
He’s giving us weird looks. Let’s leave.

166
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:02,150
To the North of the village...

167
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:10,813
When the sun flared up naked...

168
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:16,505
When a deer ran for its life...

169
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:25,592
A lion that preyed set out on a hunt.

170
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:32,639
When he takes a breath...

171
00:13:32,948 --> 00:13:37,698
The air freezes with
terror and shifts flight.

172
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:44,526
When he thumps his foot,
the Earth trembles.

173
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,762
He is not a human being...

174
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,642
He’s one of a kind...

175
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:11,967
Please spare me...

176
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:16,886
I’ll run away from all of this.

177
00:15:17,564 --> 00:15:19,272
I’ll go far away from people.

178
00:15:19,342 --> 00:15:21,824
Shut up, you brute!

179
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:25,852
When nobody knows about your existence...

180
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:27,507
What’s the point in being alive?

181
00:15:27,838 --> 00:15:29,713
You deserve to die!

182
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,264
It was my fault...

183
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:34,264
I'll give you all my wealth...

184
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:36,972
Let me go.

185
00:15:37,085 --> 00:15:38,668
Crazy fellow…

186
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,641
Usually, people earn a lot of money...

187
00:15:42,264 --> 00:15:45,347
But I’ve earned a lot of fear.

188
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:48,711
The fear I see in your eyes...

189
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:51,875
That fear keeps me happy.

190
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:54,939
Kasi! I’m a man of small desires...

191
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,588
Hand me the gun!
I’ll shoot him at once.

192
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:00,990
Hey, you!

193
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:02,930
Stop! Don’t make a fuss.

194
00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:05,014
Don’t stop me,
why are you still talking to him?

195
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,597
Lets just kill him!

196
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:10,650
Can I say the same about you?

197
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,430
Sorry, boss.

198
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,180
Please spare me...

199
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,225
I’m begging you.

200
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:18,472
What are you up to?

201
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:22,277
You pretend to be innocent
when you see me...

202
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,722
And act all macho when I’m away.

203
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:26,590
What did he say?

204
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:30,371
Gani can’t fool around with me.

205
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:33,722
Today I want you to dance...

206
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:35,202
And I want to watch it.

207
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:37,547
Basic moves won’t do.

208
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,434
I want you to do fire dance.

209
00:16:40,305 --> 00:16:41,555
How do they say it...

210
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,722
Yes...

211
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,620
It’s just like playing with fire.

212
00:17:53,514 --> 00:17:55,472
Sir, where did the people go?

213
00:17:56,344 --> 00:17:57,886
We just heard murderer's name...

214
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,972
And hearing it out loud,
everyone ran away.

215
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:02,680
What’s his name, sir?

216
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:03,972
Ganesh!

217
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,775
Gaddalakonda Ganesh!

218
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,687
I've arranged everything for you
at Gaddalakonda.

219
00:18:11,805 --> 00:18:12,847
Happy journey....

220
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:15,097
You’re leaving as an Assistant Director.
I hope you return as a Director.

221
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:16,378
Okay, bye.

222
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:17,557
Bro...!

223
00:18:19,956 --> 00:18:22,123
I’d buy matches and you cigarettes...

224
00:18:22,222 --> 00:18:24,180
I’d buy snacks and you alcohol...

225
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,097
I’d hire a hooker and...
- Hey!

226
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:28,594
You’d pay for her cab.

227
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:32,076
Hyderabad will feel empty without you.
I’ll come along.

228
00:18:32,787 --> 00:18:33,829
I’ll come back soon.

229
00:18:58,294 --> 00:18:59,377
Sir! Sir!

230
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:00,584
Sir!

231
00:19:01,677 --> 00:19:02,624
Hey!

232
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:08,427
- Get in!
- Shut the hell up! Go! Go!

233
00:19:12,948 --> 00:19:13,948
Get down.

234
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:15,555
Bro...

235
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:17,601
We got him, You can kill him.

236
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,680
Who are you guys?

237
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:21,305
Boss is coming!

238
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:29,358
Surprise!

239
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:30,972
Welcome to Gaddalakonda!

240
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:32,597
Kondamalli! It's you?!
- Hey!

241
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:34,545
It’s Konda Mallikarjuna Rao.

242
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:38,087
Kondamalli and Sons, Tamarind Traders,
Gaddalakonda.

243
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:41,435
I planned a small surprise to make
the introduction interesting.

244
00:19:41,592 --> 00:19:43,300
How was the surprise? How’s the josh?

245
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:48,097
- It sucks, just like your tamarind.
- Hey!

246
00:19:51,344 --> 00:19:53,178
Tamarind isn’t just my profession...

247
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:54,915
It’s my emotion.

248
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:58,597
What?!

249
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:01,699
You want to click pictures and videos
of Ganesh without his knowledge?

250
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:03,922
Why do you want to make a movie on him?

251
00:20:03,972 --> 00:20:07,514
Why don’t you make melodramas?

252
00:20:07,784 --> 00:20:10,450
Make these type of films and
family audience will support you.

253
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:18,753
Cheers!

254
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,208
He’s not human...

255
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:25,347
He’s like a monster.

256
00:20:25,722 --> 00:20:26,972
He has a lot of enemies...

257
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:30,390
Even if he doubts someone
is looking for him...

258
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,222
He will kill them.

259
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:35,452
What are you doing?

260
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:37,014
I’m recording your notes.

261
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:38,764
Hell no!

262
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,789
I didn't offend Gaddalakonda Ganesh.

263
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,067
He’s like a God to us.

264
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,916
We all need his blessings
to settle in life.

265
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,835
Who records such stuff?

266
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:49,963
Gaddalakonda Ganesh!

267
00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:52,347
This name sends shivers down your spine.

268
00:20:53,313 --> 00:20:57,308
But to see the second hero
of the film Kondamalli is also scared...

269
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:01,226
It’s surprising me!

270
00:21:01,588 --> 00:21:02,755
Second hero?!

271
00:21:03,657 --> 00:21:05,115
- Me?!
- Yes!

272
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,805
You are.

273
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:16,014
I don't look charming...

274
00:21:17,764 --> 00:21:18,972
But I’m pretty talented.

275
00:21:23,302 --> 00:21:24,677
Will you shoot a film with me?

276
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,101
Of course!

277
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,072
At the border of Telangana and Andhra...

278
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,607
In no man’s land...
Born in Gaddalakonda,

279
00:21:40,956 --> 00:21:43,207
he tried his luck in the film industry...

280
00:21:43,621 --> 00:21:48,534
From trading tamarind
to setting screens on fire.

281
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,572
A man with a huge fan following...

282
00:21:52,793 --> 00:21:57,245
Konda Mallikarjuna Rao alias Kondamalli...

283
00:21:57,354 --> 00:21:59,042
We congratulate you...

284
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:01,475
All the best, Kondamalli!

285
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:04,130
He might be Gaddalakonda Ganesh...

286
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,604
But we’re talking about
Mallikonda Malli here!

287
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:09,764
You’re making a film!
And I’ll help you do it!

288
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:13,695
I have a doubt...

289
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:15,148
Can the second hero sell tamarind?

290
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,264
Yes.

291
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:22,227
Booze and eat as much as you can...

292
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:24,739
On the occasion of my release from jail.

293
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:26,674
Cheers!

294
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:29,445
Brother is on his way.
Come on, hustle!

295
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:31,186
Keep it here.

296
00:22:34,514 --> 00:22:36,680
Who’s coming?
What’s all the fuss about?

297
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:58,710
Oh no!

298
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,597
I can’t believe you guys actually
paid him attention.

299
00:23:01,264 --> 00:23:02,472
Hey, Gani!

300
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:10,574
It’s me. Nallamandu Babji!

301
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,680
Don’t you recognize me?

302
00:23:11,764 --> 00:23:13,847
I’d hang out at Janata Bar
when you were a kid.

303
00:23:14,555 --> 00:23:18,514
I’d give him 2 rupees if he opened
a beer can with his teeth.

304
00:23:20,097 --> 00:23:21,930
This fool didn’t recognize me.

305
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,130
It’s been so long...

306
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:31,532
- How are you doing?
- I’m doing great.

307
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:34,532
Feel free to eat and booze...

308
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:36,043
Bill is on me.

309
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:39,680
No thanks.

310
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,919
I’m doing well with God's blessings...

311
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,143
You carry on.

312
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:47,515
Gani!

313
00:23:47,674 --> 00:23:49,341
No matter how much you grow...

314
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,441
Never forget your roots...

315
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:53,420
If you think you’re still humble...

316
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,217
Open this beer bottle for me...

317
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,097
I’ll give you 2 rupees like old times.

318
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:02,730
What do you say? Huh?

319
00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:04,156
Gani!

320
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:05,743
I can’t take it anymore.

321
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,612
You don’t stress about it.

322
00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:11,597
Hand me the gun and  I’ll fire
the magazine in his throat.

323
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:13,430
Hey! Go get beer.

324
00:24:14,897 --> 00:24:17,572
Hey, opener! Times have changed...

325
00:24:17,744 --> 00:24:20,232
I’ll give you 200 rupees instead...

326
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:23,176
Open the beer bottle.

327
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:33,763
It's just beer, right?

328
00:24:35,295 --> 00:24:37,003
Yes, come...

329
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:42,015
Hey!

330
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,222
What’s wrong?
Are you out of practice?

331
00:24:54,764 --> 00:24:56,347
I haven’t forgotten a thing...

332
00:24:57,389 --> 00:24:59,264
I didn’t want to remember few things...

333
00:25:00,514 --> 00:25:01,764
But I had to remember.

334
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:23,873
Hey!

335
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:25,788
Guys, how much did he agree to pay up?

336
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,275
200 rupees.

337
00:25:34,972 --> 00:25:36,180
My blood and sweat.

338
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:39,125
Hey!

339
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,980
Bet on me and you will win.

340
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,541
Bet against me and you will die.

341
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:55,983
Oh my goodness!

342
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:57,686
- Let’s go. Come on.
- I was right.

343
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,015
The villain in my film is my hero.

344
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,015
"I'm all about pouncing on"

345
00:26:06,637 --> 00:26:09,345
"I'm all about firing bullets"

346
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:12,738
"Killing anyone who's in the way"

347
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:16,052
"And going beyond the limits"

348
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:19,594
"No toddy can get me high"

349
00:26:20,093 --> 00:26:23,009
"No cheap alcohol can give me the rush"

350
00:26:23,502 --> 00:26:26,377
"No weed can push my senses"

351
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:29,302
"But smacking someone is my thing"

352
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:33,238
"That fear gives me the high"

353
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,565
"The high that sucks
the breath out of you"

354
00:26:38,018 --> 00:26:43,168
"That fear is the throne
in your heart I grace"

355
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:46,823
"Fighting is no big deal to me"

356
00:26:48,072 --> 00:26:50,197
"I don't give a damn about my life"

357
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:56,967
"I worship myself as God
Watch out for me"

358
00:27:02,702 --> 00:27:05,869
The paperwork for the contract is ready.

359
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:09,758
Hey, old woman! Stop!

360
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:11,445
Hey!

361
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,210
She’s my mother! My mother!

362
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,654
Only after she is done,
we will begin our work.

363
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,508
- Sir, that document...
- Shhh!

364
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,169
Tell me!
What is this meeting about?

365
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,612
"I'm all about pouncing on"

366
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:36,383
There’s been an attack on Ganesh...

367
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:37,772
He was almost dead.

368
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:41,389
"Killing anyone who's in the way"

369
00:27:41,932 --> 00:27:44,599
"And going beyond the limits"

370
00:27:47,711 --> 00:27:50,419
Hey, you! Are you listening?

371
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:52,854
It's neither there nor here.

372
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:55,776
Your heart is where I reside.

373
00:27:58,188 --> 00:28:01,396
"There's no truth or lie
My word is a testimony"

374
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:04,855
"There's no going forward or backward
My path is your ultimatum"

375
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:08,109
"There's no small or big murder
Every bullet I fire makes a statement"

376
00:28:08,524 --> 00:28:11,857
"There's no life or death
Life is a chase"

377
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:15,718
"I'd strangle you with my mustache
if it comes down to that"

378
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,428
"I'd kill a dead body
if I'm not content"

379
00:28:26,867 --> 00:28:28,573
"That fear gives me the high"

380
00:28:30,253 --> 00:28:32,033
"The high that sucks
the breath out of you"

381
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:38,671
"That fear is the throne
in your heart I grace"

382
00:28:40,373 --> 00:28:42,245
"Fighting is no big deal to me"

383
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:45,646
"I don't give a damn about my life"

384
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,276
"I worship myself as God
Watch out for me"

385
00:28:54,172 --> 00:28:56,797
Who got you the land deal?

386
00:28:56,889 --> 00:28:58,972
- You did it.
- Then why is he here for the inauguration?

387
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:02,164
- He’s a hero, so...
- If he’s the hero, who am I?

388
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,755
- The villain?
- I was just hoping for some publicity.

389
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:06,818
For a month beginning now...

390
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:08,643
You and your men...

391
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:11,765
Should get naked and sell these clothes.

392
00:29:12,174 --> 00:29:13,633
It’s the best publicity you can get.

393
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:18,004
"I'm all about pouncing on"

394
00:29:18,629 --> 00:29:21,337
"I'm all about firing bullets"

395
00:29:22,004 --> 00:29:24,796
"Killing anyone who's in the way"

396
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:28,346
"And going beyond the limits"

397
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:35,045
To my surprise...
He’s much bigger!

398
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,109
More stronger!

399
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:38,946
And most dangerous!

400
00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:41,998
Gani has two main men in his gang...

401
00:29:42,105 --> 00:29:43,011
Kasi...

402
00:29:43,191 --> 00:29:45,784
Gani passes orders and Kasi executes it.

403
00:29:46,355 --> 00:29:47,401
Drinking is his weakness...

404
00:29:47,475 --> 00:29:50,095
He’s out of the world and
into a bar at 9 dot.

405
00:29:50,427 --> 00:29:52,761
Balijayya is the other guy.
Action films are his weakness...

406
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:55,038
I don’t mean the Rambo, Terminator...

407
00:29:55,206 --> 00:29:56,653
He has a unique taste in action films.

408
00:29:57,189 --> 00:29:58,562
There’s one more guy in the gang...

409
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:01,289
Kanthayya! Khanberi Kanthayya!

410
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,912
He does the small stuff like threats...

411
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:05,432
Ganesh owns this theater...

412
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:08,296
This is Operator Chalam... He’s unmarried.

413
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:10,617
Maybe that is why he screens adult films.

414
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:13,632
We should focus on
all these three people.

415
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:17,642
They can help us know
Gani’s professional side.

416
00:30:18,975 --> 00:30:20,975
But to know his personal side...

417
00:30:22,202 --> 00:30:23,493
We need someone closer to him.

418
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,835
Girls! Is she ready?

419
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:35,848
The groom’s family is on the way.

420
00:30:35,913 --> 00:30:37,063
- Grandma...
- Huh?

421
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,493
I don’t want this alliance.

422
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:40,386
What’s wrong with you?

423
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:44,034
You’re always saying no to marriage.

424
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:47,133
I never said I didn’t want marriage.
I just don’t want this marriage.

425
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:49,289
Get married to Ganesh then...

426
00:30:49,396 --> 00:30:51,521
You can live like a queen.

427
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:53,452
Ravan abducted Sita...

428
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,162
His grandma didn’t abduct her for him.

429
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,561
Shut up! This is the right choice for you.
Come on.

430
00:30:58,034 --> 00:31:00,159
I’m not trying to boast but...

431
00:31:00,274 --> 00:31:01,864
You can’t point a single
flaw in the groom.

432
00:31:01,928 --> 00:31:03,678
Try pointing your finger and
he’ll chop it off.

433
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:04,850
That’s right.

434
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,008
You talk about chopping fingers.
What does he do anyway?

435
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,121
He worked under Peddi Reddy
until a while ago...

436
00:31:10,224 --> 00:31:14,058
He murdered a guy at a fair recently...

437
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:15,841
He has his own gang now.

438
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:17,634
He’ll take good care of your granddaughter.

439
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,051
- Am I right?
- Hmm.

440
00:31:19,726 --> 00:31:21,434
You’ve heard enough about us...

441
00:31:21,624 --> 00:31:22,999
Tell us about the bride.

442
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:24,863
Does she cook?

443
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:26,893
Of course!

444
00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:30,025
I run a small hotel, thanks to her.

445
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,318
She’s great at it.

446
00:31:33,312 --> 00:31:35,562
Hey, girl! Do you know music?

447
00:31:35,924 --> 00:31:37,590
Can you sing?

448
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,185
I don’t know what Mujic is.

449
00:31:39,336 --> 00:31:40,461
But I can sing.

450
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,632
Then sing...

451
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,275
Kill it! Rock it!

452
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:46,301
It’s a song for God’s sake.
Stop saying that.

453
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,888
Ask me to sing well.

454
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,859
Rock the song!

455
00:31:50,036 --> 00:31:51,209
What about dance?

456
00:31:51,891 --> 00:31:54,524
Show them a double bonanza, dear.

457
00:31:55,972 --> 00:31:56,972
Go ahead.

458
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:11,585
"Steal all that you can
Steal this beautiful treasure"

459
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:14,208
"Steal something out of other's reach"

460
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,002
"Steal all that you can
Steal this beautiful treasure"

461
00:32:21,377 --> 00:32:23,294
"Steal something out of other's reach"

462
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:25,585
"I'm like the sea"

463
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,252
"You're my sailor"

464
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:33,020
"This is an invite
Steal all that you can"

465
00:32:34,215 --> 00:32:35,631
Whoa!

466
00:32:38,736 --> 00:32:39,845
Idiot!

467
00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:46,320
Our families are here...
I don’t want to bother them.

468
00:32:47,171 --> 00:32:49,171
I’ll do the rest after marriage.

469
00:32:51,698 --> 00:32:53,573
I like her. I like her.

470
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,723
Shut up!

471
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:57,498
We’re looking for a wife for my son.

472
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,617
Not a stage dancer.

473
00:33:00,832 --> 00:33:01,999
To hell with the alliance!

474
00:33:03,013 --> 00:33:04,722
Hey, listen!
We can try a different song.

475
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,872
Don’t leave. Come on!
We can try a different song.

476
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:09,116
It’s no big deal.

477
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:10,921
You...!

478
00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:23,545
What kind of a movie is this?

479
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:25,234
There’s nothing interesting.

480
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:27,020
Tik Tok videos are much better.

481
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,113
How was that Malayalam flick
we watched last time?

482
00:33:29,191 --> 00:33:32,232
Wow! It makes me go weak in the knees.

483
00:33:32,884 --> 00:33:34,524
Let’s watch it again.

484
00:33:38,403 --> 00:33:39,503
Hey! Who the heck are you?

485
00:33:40,076 --> 00:33:41,829
Bro, it’s you?!

486
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:43,276
Can you please move?

487
00:33:43,378 --> 00:33:45,098
Can I have the Malayalam disc?

488
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,258
We can’t just keep boozing...

489
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,255
I’m high already. But he isn’t here yet.

490
00:33:58,301 --> 00:33:59,395
He’ll be here soon.

491
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:20,978
He didn't come for us.

492
00:34:29,557 --> 00:34:30,924
Hey! This isn’t a free ride.

493
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:33,104
Who’s going to buy the tickets?
Your uncle?

494
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:34,178
Go.

495
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,155
Uncle!

496
00:34:40,087 --> 00:34:41,313
Uncle...

497
00:34:43,096 --> 00:34:44,255
I’m not here for the movie.

498
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:51,428
I never expected to see you here.

499
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:53,487
Even I never expected you to come here.

500
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,803
Destiny brought us together here.

501
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:59,095
- Your aunt...
- Doesn’t have to know.

502
00:34:59,777 --> 00:35:02,598
- And my dad...
- Doesn’t have to know either.

503
00:35:04,504 --> 00:35:05,797
Don’t miss the beginning.

504
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,496
I’m worried I can’t finish
the script in time.

505
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:19,151
Stay strong when you’re losing...

506
00:35:19,645 --> 00:35:21,822
Stay humble when you’re winning.

507
00:35:22,149 --> 00:35:25,234
- When you’re in danger...
- Shut up when you are drunk.

508
00:35:26,262 --> 00:35:28,735
I’m trying to get close to Kasi and...

509
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:30,459
You’re annoying me with Facebook quotes.

510
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:32,261
I’m not innocent like you.

511
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:33,747
Just see the show.

512
00:35:34,314 --> 00:35:35,473
- Move!
- Hey!

513
00:35:35,664 --> 00:35:37,664
Ranga! Take the order.

514
00:35:38,078 --> 00:35:40,270
Excuse me! May I come in?

515
00:35:40,448 --> 00:35:41,534
Thank you.

516
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,746
I notice you everyday...

517
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:46,133
You sit all alone and booze...

518
00:35:46,232 --> 00:35:49,782
I want to give you company...
After all, we’re from the same village.

519
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,305
Hey... Sit.

520
00:35:52,601 --> 00:35:54,148
He’s Abhi from Hyderabad.

521
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,316
Brother, order.

522
00:35:56,711 --> 00:35:58,139
- Half brandy.
- Hey!

523
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,873
The bill is on us.

524
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,911
After all, we’re from the same village.

525
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:03,691
Any snacks?

526
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,755
Fish fry and chicken fry.

527
00:36:06,844 --> 00:36:09,090
Non-veg! That is on us too.

528
00:36:09,872 --> 00:36:11,905
After all, we’re from the same village.
Please don’t say no.

529
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:13,225
Swear on me.

530
00:36:21,488 --> 00:36:23,828
Whoa! Look at you!

531
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:27,233
Sweet and cute gentleman.

532
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:30,054
You’re still steady.
- Bloody fool...

533
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,443
You think you’re bloody rich?

534
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:36,788
You think I can’t afford
my own drinks and snacks?

535
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:38,365
- Ranga!
- Bro...

536
00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:40,834
- How much am I due?
- 32,000 rupees, bro.

537
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:42,331
Clear it.

538
00:36:44,455 --> 00:36:46,168
After all, we’re from the same village.

539
00:36:46,341 --> 00:36:48,594
Money is no big deal...
Friendship is more important.

540
00:36:49,361 --> 00:36:50,580
He’ll clear my dues.

541
00:36:53,214 --> 00:36:54,587
Come with me... Clear the bill.

542
00:36:59,953 --> 00:37:02,039
- Hey! Congrats!
- Thank you.

543
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,001
Let’s click a picture.

544
00:37:40,249 --> 00:37:42,009
Where are you from?

545
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:44,784
- Tell me where you’re from.
- Please, let him go for my sake.

546
00:37:44,901 --> 00:37:47,394
Let him go!
What's the issue?

547
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:49,224
Tell me! Where are you from?

548
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,859
I’m going to ask you one last time.
Tell me!

549
00:37:50,942 --> 00:37:52,568
Dommaripalem!

550
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,634
I knew it.

551
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,298
He’s not here to marry your daughter...
He’s here to spy on me.

552
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,514
He’s one of Penchalayya’s men...

553
00:38:01,964 --> 00:38:04,788
He’s here to watch me closely...

554
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:07,248
And find the opportunity to kill me.

555
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,323
Hey!

556
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:11,446
Go tell him...

557
00:38:12,243 --> 00:38:14,605
Ask him not to worry about killing me...

558
00:38:15,537 --> 00:38:19,129
He should be thinking about
saving his own life.

559
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:20,445
Go!

560
00:38:25,149 --> 00:38:26,862
Your issue is solved...

561
00:38:27,028 --> 00:38:30,455
But who’s going to marry my daughter
after this incident?

562
00:38:36,718 --> 00:38:38,718
Hey! Come here.

563
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:40,740
I said come here!

564
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:42,901
- Where are you from?
- I’m a local, bro.

565
00:38:43,062 --> 00:38:44,521
But I’m leaving.
I’ll never come back.

566
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:46,094
Hey! What did you pursue?

567
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:48,467
I’m a graduate, bro.
I got a job during placements

568
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,053
I’m moving. I’ll be gone soon.

569
00:38:50,147 --> 00:38:51,553
Hey! What’s your father’s name?

570
00:38:51,689 --> 00:38:53,241
Subhramanya Murthy.

571
00:38:53,477 --> 00:38:55,350
He works in the bank, doesn’t he?

572
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:56,947
- Yes.
- Wow!

573
00:38:57,443 --> 00:39:00,150
He’s from a banking background.
What say?

574
00:39:06,114 --> 00:39:07,020
Your name?

575
00:39:07,147 --> 00:39:09,073
- Ravi. Ravi Teja.
- I like it.

576
00:39:09,335 --> 00:39:11,589
Actually, I’m Mass Maharaja’s fan.

577
00:39:11,797 --> 00:39:13,177
- Oh, really?
- Hmm.

578
00:39:13,844 --> 00:39:14,844
One selfie?

579
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,160
Hey! Look at the camera.

580
00:39:23,889 --> 00:39:24,895
Hey.

581
00:39:26,493 --> 00:39:27,553
Look...

582
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:29,943
No one can stop the wedding bells
from ringing.

583
00:39:30,171 --> 00:39:32,084
- Don’t you think so?
- What can I say?

584
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:34,264
This wedding feels very weird to me.

585
00:39:35,715 --> 00:39:38,107
Carry on...
Nothing I can do about it.

586
00:39:39,273 --> 00:39:41,366
What do you think about an sexy song
for the second hero?

587
00:39:41,437 --> 00:39:42,237
Think about it.

588
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:43,431
Hello, bro...

589
00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:45,145
- How are you doing?
- Hello.

590
00:39:45,224 --> 00:39:47,617
How did you like the African disc?

591
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:49,799
There was no audio.
I couldn’t hear anything.

592
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:51,461
Why do you need audio for these films?

593
00:39:51,732 --> 00:39:54,734
Crazy fellow!
Audio is my favorite part.

594
00:39:55,118 --> 00:39:57,004
[MOANING]

595
00:40:01,134 --> 00:40:02,221
Shut up!

596
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:05,319
Bro, what about the Japanese disc?

597
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,192
Give it to me.
I’ll watch and let you know.

598
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:08,325
You don't have it?

599
00:40:08,432 --> 00:40:09,944
I put it in your vehicle yesterday.

600
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,027
It has ‘Sagara Sangamam’ label
on the outside.

601
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,768
But the real stuff is inside.

602
00:40:20,097 --> 00:40:23,043
My family is going to watch
‘Sagara Sangamam’ today.

603
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,389
You got me into trouble.

604
00:40:29,465 --> 00:40:31,711
‘Kalatapasvi’ K. Viswanadh’s movie.

605
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:34,085
My husband and I watched it several times.

606
00:40:34,251 --> 00:40:38,368
There are hardly any movies
we can watch with the family anymore.

607
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:39,621
You’re right.

608
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,268
Santhi!

609
00:41:07,527 --> 00:41:09,047
Rascal!

610
00:41:09,665 --> 00:41:13,111
If you ever get me these discs again...

611
00:41:13,326 --> 00:41:15,152
I’m going to smack you to the floor.

612
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,412
Get lost!

613
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:24,972
All doors leading to Ganesh are now closed.

614
00:41:25,465 --> 00:41:27,202
Only God can get us out of this.

615
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:52,110
Don’t you dare mess it up.

616
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:55,749
Why are you taking her pictures?

617
00:41:55,811 --> 00:41:57,538
We’ll be dead...
Ganesh likes her.

618
00:41:57,665 --> 00:41:58,680
Her name is Bujjamma.

619
00:41:58,743 --> 00:42:00,520
Her grandmother is a maid at Ganesh’s home.

620
00:42:00,696 --> 00:42:03,209
She hopes to get her married
to Ganesh someday.

621
00:42:04,129 --> 00:42:05,582
That’s some amazing information...

622
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,468
So if I manage to impress Bujjamma...
She will lead us to Ganesh.

623
00:42:09,275 --> 00:42:11,588
If he finds out about this,
he will kill us both.

624
00:42:11,735 --> 00:42:14,150
Oh no! She’s coming this way.
Come on... Hide from her.

625
00:42:16,315 --> 00:42:19,774
Oh God! Ganesh’s feats
are going viral day by day.

626
00:42:19,978 --> 00:42:22,786
The wedding he performed on the street
is trending in town.

627
00:42:23,003 --> 00:42:26,364
Fearing Ganesh, no guy dares
to even look at me.

628
00:42:27,409 --> 00:42:30,043
Girls my age are flooding their
Instagram feed...

629
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:33,011
While I’m still in the telegram era,
no thanks to my grandma.

630
00:42:33,145 --> 00:42:35,565
I post sexy pictures on Facebook and yet...

631
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:37,144
I don’t have a single like.

632
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:39,907
I hope no girl ever goes through this pain.

633
00:42:40,932 --> 00:42:42,738
Forget about kisses and cuddles...

634
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:44,663
I can’t even get a hug from a guy...

635
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:50,258
Bring a sweet boyfriend into my life...

636
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:54,468
Do this for me and I’ll have him
break 101 coconuts for you.

637
00:42:54,587 --> 00:42:55,941
Oh no!

638
00:42:56,844 --> 00:42:57,984
Oh God!

639
00:42:58,741 --> 00:43:00,506
Abhi! Bujjamma!

640
00:43:06,186 --> 00:43:07,952
He hugged you... Why’d you slap me?

641
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:09,799
Hey, Tamarind! Is he your friend?

642
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:10,969
Yeah!

643
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:13,500
Abhilash!

644
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,261
- You must’ve heard the name.
- Shut up!

645
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:18,288
Sorry, Bujjamma.
He’s new in town. It was a mistake.

646
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:20,798
But you aren’t new here, right?
Don’t you know who I am?

647
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:22,840
- Wait. Let me call Ganesh and...
- Sister! Sister!

648
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:24,495
You don’t have to tell Ganesh now.

649
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,663
I offer my sincere apologies.
I’m begging you.

650
00:43:27,376 --> 00:43:29,049
You’ve been supplying tamarind
since I was a kid.

651
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,564
Stop calling me sister!

652
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,747
I supply to the whole of Gaddalakonda.

653
00:43:32,848 --> 00:43:35,161
- Let’s go to Ganesh.
- Okay! Let’s go.

654
00:43:35,342 --> 00:43:36,505
You hold on.

655
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,430
Sorry... I’ll never call you sister again.

656
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:39,903
You don’t have to apologize.

657
00:43:40,629 --> 00:43:42,702
She must actually thank us for it.

658
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,409
- Thank you?!
- Yeah. Thank us.

659
00:43:44,876 --> 00:43:46,142
She did wish for a hug...

660
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:47,962
God sent me as a blessing.

661
00:43:48,304 --> 00:43:49,792
You can give me my hug back if you mind.

662
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:51,256
Please give me my hug back!

663
00:43:51,343 --> 00:43:52,656
Stop trying to be Shahrukh Khan.

664
00:43:52,818 --> 00:43:54,238
I can’t believe you’re such a flirt.

665
00:43:54,409 --> 00:43:55,862
- Bujjamma...
- Wait. I’ll tell Ganesh.

666
00:43:55,981 --> 00:43:57,668
I know exactly what to do with you two.

667
00:43:57,884 --> 00:43:59,397
Sister! Sister!

668
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:01,473
You ruined it.

669
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:04,937
If she were really going to tell him,
she’d have done it already.

670
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,296
Even if she does tell him,
we’d only get closer to Ganesh.

671
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:09,353
In case she doesn’t,
we’d still get closer to Bujjamma.

672
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:11,988
Heads or tails, we win the toss.

673
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:14,830
Let’s go.

674
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,612
Just make sure you keep me safe.

675
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:34,782
I’m warning you beforehand...

676
00:44:34,935 --> 00:44:37,972
No matter what the decision is...
I don’t want any bloodshed.

677
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:39,935
It should be a peaceful conversation.

678
00:44:40,668 --> 00:44:41,938
Buchanna!

679
00:44:43,921 --> 00:44:45,146
Give brother’s crown.

680
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:51,474
Raise the sword!

681
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:05,878
We nominate Buchi Naidu as the
MLA of Gaddalakonda for this term.

682
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,759
Ganesh is on his way...

683
00:45:08,663 --> 00:45:10,079
Let’s discuss further once he’s here.

684
00:45:10,338 --> 00:45:12,639
This isn’t hooliganism to ask
for Ganesh’s permission.

685
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:14,862
It’s politics.

686
00:45:15,857 --> 00:45:18,179
Buchi Naidu will be the MLA this term.

687
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:20,594
Hail Buchi Naidu!

688
00:45:20,781 --> 00:45:22,388
Hail Buchi Naidu!

689
00:45:22,575 --> 00:45:24,241
Hail Buchi Naidu!

690
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:06,143
My dad has been an MLA all his life.

691
00:46:06,449 --> 00:46:07,869
He wishes to die as an MLA.

692
00:46:08,788 --> 00:46:10,881
Let’s give it to him this one last time.

693
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,018
You’d say that now...

694
00:46:13,272 --> 00:46:14,608
But once he is dead...

695
00:46:14,769 --> 00:46:16,296
You will stand in his name.

696
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,770
I honestly don't wish for it...

697
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,033
Politics is just not my thing.

698
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:22,587
Let’s make him the MLA as long as
he’s with us.

699
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:24,372
This is a genuine request.

700
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,725
Wow!

701
00:46:26,058 --> 00:46:27,720
Are you worried about the fact
that your father is alive?

702
00:46:27,867 --> 00:46:28,740
Do something...

703
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,814
Why don’t you kill him?

704
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,442
All our problems would come to an end.

705
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,316
What do you think?

706
00:46:37,257 --> 00:46:38,277
Kill him!

707
00:46:38,892 --> 00:46:41,726
It’s no big deal.
When he lies down on his bed tonight...

708
00:46:41,972 --> 00:46:44,965
Just grab a pillow and suffocate him...

709
00:46:45,127 --> 00:46:46,726
It only takes 2 minutes.

710
00:46:48,654 --> 00:46:50,247
What say? Are you up for it?

711
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:51,666
What the hell are you talking?

712
00:46:51,785 --> 00:46:54,193
- Hey! Watch your words, kiddo!
- Don’t call me a kiddo.

713
00:46:57,754 --> 00:46:58,700
There you go again.

714
00:46:58,814 --> 00:47:01,452
Like I told you, no matter
what the decision is...

715
00:47:01,629 --> 00:47:03,336
I don’t want any bloodshed.

716
00:47:03,517 --> 00:47:05,025
It should be a peaceful conversation.

717
00:47:05,225 --> 00:47:07,771
Why don’t you say something
when they’re being offensive?

718
00:47:08,973 --> 00:47:11,973
He understands he’ll be dead
if he does.

719
00:47:12,598 --> 00:47:13,937
But you’re still playing a fool.

720
00:47:16,228 --> 00:47:18,423
Buchi Naidu will be the MLA this term.

721
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:20,333
Everyone against it, raise your hand.

722
00:48:08,647 --> 00:48:09,739
Penchalayya!

723
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:12,001
We never raise our hands on someone.

724
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:13,955
Only swords.

725
00:48:14,263 --> 00:48:16,263
Ask him to stand on his feet...

726
00:48:16,638 --> 00:48:18,638
He can think about contesting
in the elections later.

727
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,702
He will be the MLA for this term as well.

728
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:24,770
Gaddalakonda Ganesh endorses it.

729
00:48:34,933 --> 00:48:35,739
Bro...

730
00:48:41,479 --> 00:48:43,268
You have put a lot at stake
for my father...

731
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,033
He’s the reason I am what I am today.

732
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,800
I’d go to any lengths for him.

733
00:48:52,255 --> 00:48:53,656
Take good care of him.

734
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,273
Look after his health.

735
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,063
Health is a tricky word...

736
00:48:58,827 --> 00:49:01,092
He enjoyed his young age to the fullest.

737
00:49:01,824 --> 00:49:04,115
He’s now bed ridden now.

738
00:49:06,218 --> 00:49:08,823
If he was a bit careful then,
he’d pass peacefully.

739
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:12,246
We humans never cease to amaze...

740
00:49:12,906 --> 00:49:16,837
We went from wishing for a peaceful life
to a peaceful death.

741
00:49:18,904 --> 00:49:20,272
One more thing...

742
00:49:20,938 --> 00:49:22,484
Father insisted that I tell you.

743
00:49:24,091 --> 00:49:26,752
Police higher officials are holding
an enquiry on you...

744
00:49:27,516 --> 00:49:29,020
We can’t trust anyone...

745
00:49:29,661 --> 00:49:32,085
People closer to you might
plot against you...

746
00:49:32,685 --> 00:49:33,691
Be careful.

747
00:49:48,996 --> 00:49:50,432
Hey! You got me to the temple.

748
00:49:50,586 --> 00:49:52,098
Will Ganesh visit the temple today?

749
00:49:52,439 --> 00:49:53,700
He’ll definitely come...

750
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:55,453
It’s his mother’s birthday today.

751
00:49:55,647 --> 00:49:57,394
So will his mother come along?

752
00:49:57,668 --> 00:49:59,889
She will not come...
Because they’re not on talking terms.

753
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:01,755
I mean to say she can't speak.

754
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:03,383
That is why she doesn’t come out often.

755
00:50:04,506 --> 00:50:06,506
Lord, audience should go crazy
about my acting.

756
00:50:07,699 --> 00:50:09,198
Come on... Keep walking.

757
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:11,932
We are walking, go find the priest...

758
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:14,077
I’ll find him. You watch your step.

759
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:30,193
Sugar tastes great with coconut.

760
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,100
Add tamarind as well. Idiot!

761
00:50:32,402 --> 00:50:33,902
Hello! Hello!

762
00:50:34,555 --> 00:50:35,802
Hey, Shahrukh Khan!

763
00:50:37,144 --> 00:50:38,017
Me?!

764
00:50:39,277 --> 00:50:40,365
She’s calling you. Go!

765
00:50:41,429 --> 00:50:42,915
You hugged me while I was alone...

766
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:45,261
If you have the guts touch me now.

767
00:50:45,731 --> 00:50:46,722
Touch me.

768
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:48,196
Touch me.

769
00:50:49,144 --> 00:50:50,610
Come on, touch me!

770
00:50:51,011 --> 00:50:52,077
What if I do?

771
00:50:52,741 --> 00:50:53,881
Impossible!

772
00:50:54,228 --> 00:50:56,304
I have Gani with me.

773
00:51:00,227 --> 00:51:02,900
Will you be my friend if I touch you?

774
00:51:03,511 --> 00:51:04,417
And then?

775
00:51:04,525 --> 00:51:06,591
Be friends and...

776
00:51:06,714 --> 00:51:08,074
Hmm. And then?

777
00:51:08,215 --> 00:51:09,861
Show me around your village.

778
00:51:10,709 --> 00:51:12,586
First touch me.

779
00:51:23,745 --> 00:51:25,365
Come on. Go ahead.

780
00:51:26,206 --> 00:51:27,425
Hey! Don’t do it.

781
00:51:41,822 --> 00:51:43,714
Guys! Go get him.

782
00:52:04,584 --> 00:52:06,543
Priest, I’m done with the basic welcome.

783
00:52:06,884 --> 00:52:08,122
Shall I proceed with the feast?

784
00:52:40,753 --> 00:52:44,292
"In the empty avenues of the skies"

785
00:52:44,379 --> 00:52:46,539
"Like the star sparkling bright"

786
00:52:47,052 --> 00:52:50,651
"In the lanes of the pounding heart"

787
00:52:50,778 --> 00:52:52,778
"Like the feelings that start flooding"

788
00:52:53,564 --> 00:52:57,019
"In the times a blessing is showered"

789
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:59,457
"Like the waterfall flowing gracefully"

790
00:53:03,155 --> 00:53:06,155
"World is astonished by the spectacle"

791
00:53:06,322 --> 00:53:10,758
"It witnesses the
waves of life crashing"

792
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:15,091
"You're the poem
You're the story"

793
00:53:15,352 --> 00:53:18,408
"You're the vision
You're the dream"

794
00:53:18,455 --> 00:53:21,647
"You're the wealth
You're the mercy"

795
00:53:21,723 --> 00:53:25,056
"Lead me to my destination"

796
00:53:25,522 --> 00:53:28,981
"In the empty avenues of the skies"

797
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:31,167
"Like the star sparkling bright"

798
00:53:31,912 --> 00:53:35,326
"In the lanes of the pounding heart"

799
00:53:35,595 --> 00:53:37,574
"Like the feelings that start flooding"
- Don't move your hand.

800
00:53:42,988 --> 00:53:46,180
This is a Kingdom. No drama troupe.

801
00:53:46,678 --> 00:53:48,444
You aren’t supposed to do romance
in front of the King.

802
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:50,479
I'm the only one with dedication.

803
00:53:51,594 --> 00:53:53,969
"When you call out for me"

804
00:53:54,742 --> 00:53:57,472
"When you make a sweet gesture"

805
00:53:57,997 --> 00:54:00,691
"Heart has nothing more to ask for"

806
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,313
"It's like a child jumping around"

807
00:54:03,578 --> 00:54:09,599
"Is it the hug that feels
like a celebration?"

808
00:54:09,888 --> 00:54:15,252
"My hopes seem to be taking flight"

809
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:19,168
"You're the poem
You're the story"

810
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:22,365
"You're the vision
You're the dream"

811
00:54:22,584 --> 00:54:25,529
"You're the wealth
You're the mercy"

812
00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:29,590
"Lead me to my destination"

813
00:54:30,693 --> 00:54:31,933
Gani’s childhood photo.

814
00:54:34,259 --> 00:54:36,199
Why do you ask about Ganesh all the time?

815
00:54:36,425 --> 00:54:38,725
Why don't you ask about me?

816
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:42,171
These are just excuses to meet you.

817
00:54:45,872 --> 00:54:48,359
"In all the paths we walk"

818
00:54:49,144 --> 00:54:51,521
"I see our footsteps align"

819
00:54:52,293 --> 00:54:54,793
"Won't the world bear testimony?"

820
00:54:55,603 --> 00:54:57,817
"To our never ending tale"

821
00:54:57,973 --> 00:55:00,974
"As we hold hand in hand"

822
00:55:01,161 --> 00:55:04,155
"Let our friendship blossom"

823
00:55:04,349 --> 00:55:09,138
"Let our hearts take
us to our happy place"

824
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,516
"You're the poem
You're the story"

825
00:55:13,683 --> 00:55:16,897
"You're the vision
You're the dream"

826
00:55:16,965 --> 00:55:19,972
"You're the wealth
You're the mercy"

827
00:55:20,139 --> 00:55:23,530
"Lead me to my destination"

828
00:55:23,972 --> 00:55:27,395
"In the empty avenues of the skies"

829
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:29,943
"Like a star sparkling bright"

830
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:33,710
"In the lanes of the pounding heart"

831
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,806
"Like the feelings that start flooding"

832
00:55:40,047 --> 00:55:43,100
MLA’s son stressed that
we don’t trust anyone.

833
00:55:43,224 --> 00:55:45,943
We should keep an eye on
the tamarind guy and his friend.

834
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:48,454
They offered me alcohol
at the bar recently...

835
00:55:48,663 --> 00:55:51,097
They gave me adult disc and
caused trouble at home...

836
00:55:51,608 --> 00:55:52,821
We should watch them closely...

837
00:55:52,968 --> 00:55:55,636
Forget watching them...
Let me just shoot them.

838
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:56,564
You really think so?

839
00:55:56,665 --> 00:55:58,851
Come on, I can handle these kids.

840
00:55:58,945 --> 00:56:00,412
Alright. Deal it your way.

841
00:56:00,586 --> 00:56:03,429
You’ll see...
I’ll show them hell.

842
00:56:10,815 --> 00:56:15,606
With you by my side...
No one can kill the second hero, uncle...

843
00:56:44,398 --> 00:56:46,273
What is this?
What the hell is this?

844
00:56:46,918 --> 00:56:48,376
Hey, Tamarind! I’m talking to you...

845
00:56:48,523 --> 00:56:49,940
Who is he? Why is he here?

846
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:52,481
I know what to do with you.
- Bro!

847
00:56:53,512 --> 00:56:54,762
Bro, our suspicion was right...

848
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:56,581
They’ve made a big plan.

849
00:56:56,734 --> 00:56:58,391
What? You want me to kill them?

850
00:56:58,739 --> 00:57:00,822
Thanks, bro. They will be my first.

851
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:01,956
Love you, bro!

852
00:57:01,998 --> 00:57:04,040
- No, bro. You’re reading it wrong.
- Shut up!

853
00:57:04,456 --> 00:57:06,456
You think I can’t read?

854
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:07,831
G-A-N... Gun!

855
00:57:08,956 --> 00:57:10,331
K-S-I... Kasi!

856
00:57:10,415 --> 00:57:11,748
F-O-C-S... Fasak!

857
00:57:12,238 --> 00:57:13,571
B-A-L-I... Bali!

858
00:57:13,665 --> 00:57:15,290
What’s that to the corner?
Shooting?

859
00:57:15,456 --> 00:57:18,998
So are you planning to have a shootout
and sacrifice our bodies?

860
00:57:19,123 --> 00:57:20,540
Whom are you going to sacrifice?

861
00:57:20,748 --> 00:57:22,123
Whom are you going to kill?

862
00:57:22,331 --> 00:57:23,581
Our boss?

863
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,853
We didn’t mean shooting bullets.

864
00:57:26,248 --> 00:57:27,373
It’s shooting with the camera.

865
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:29,748
Are you cooking up stories now?

866
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:31,581
We’re really here to narrate a story.

867
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,873
I’m a student from VISCOM.

868
00:57:33,998 --> 00:57:38,540
I’m here to shoot a documentary
on the beauty of villages.

869
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:40,581
I’m supposed to click some pictures.

870
00:57:42,144 --> 00:57:43,498
- Let's go.
- Where?

871
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:47,866
You were going to click pictures, right?
I’ll see how it’s done.

872
00:57:50,415 --> 00:57:51,956
Capture that buffalo...

873
00:57:52,956 --> 00:57:54,248
Hey! What the hell is this?

874
00:57:54,415 --> 00:57:55,623
Just click the picture.

875
00:57:55,746 --> 00:57:56,705
Smile!

876
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,621
Don’t you know how to smile?
Come on, smile!

877
00:58:05,831 --> 00:58:08,206
Why are you clicking pictures
without my consent?

878
00:58:08,331 --> 00:58:09,915
Come on! Pull the film out.

879
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,831
I’ll burn it right here.

880
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,706
You look like a hero with a cigar
in your hand...

881
00:58:14,998 --> 00:58:17,748
You might be cast as the second hero
in some film.

882
00:58:20,165 --> 00:58:22,040
How many second heroes does your film have?

883
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,706
He’s nothing compared to me.

884
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:24,790
Hey!

885
00:58:24,873 --> 00:58:26,081
Sir, I was just kidding.

886
00:58:26,195 --> 00:58:28,528
He’d be the second hero...
Sorry. Second villain...

887
00:58:28,665 --> 00:58:30,331
- Second villain?
- Hold on.

888
00:58:30,581 --> 00:58:31,748
Give me the camera.

889
00:58:35,665 --> 00:58:36,623
Wow!

890
00:58:36,748 --> 00:58:39,581
You clicked great pictures without
inserting the film.

891
00:58:39,718 --> 00:58:41,218
You seem extremely talented.

892
00:58:41,331 --> 00:58:43,956
Come. I’ll make you click
some amazing pictures.

893
00:58:44,091 --> 00:58:45,549
Hey, Thermocol! Let’s go.

894
00:59:04,956 --> 00:59:05,956
Cut it.

895
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,160
Here you go.

896
00:59:16,081 --> 00:59:18,498
Ganesh is here.
Hello, brother.

897
00:59:19,748 --> 00:59:21,156
I was worried you wouldn’t come.

898
00:59:21,248 --> 00:59:22,956
Please come.
Guys, give way.

899
00:59:23,123 --> 00:59:24,498
Move aside...

900
00:59:24,956 --> 00:59:26,290
Please come...
Feed her the cake, brother.

901
00:59:26,456 --> 00:59:27,790
Eat it, sweetheart.

902
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:29,373
Amrutha, eat it.

903
00:59:29,623 --> 00:59:31,540
Come on, sweetheart. Eat it.

904
00:59:31,873 --> 00:59:34,028
Hey! Are you insane?
Why don’t you eat it?

905
00:59:34,075 --> 00:59:34,989
Eat dear.

906
00:59:35,206 --> 00:59:36,165
Shut up!

907
00:59:38,271 --> 00:59:39,438
Stop crying!

908
00:59:39,652 --> 00:59:40,661
Brother, please don’t mind.

909
00:59:40,762 --> 00:59:42,471
She’s a little girl. Don’t be offended.

910
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,567
Brother...

911
00:59:50,706 --> 00:59:51,706
Cheers!

912
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:53,956
Cheers!

913
01:00:05,998 --> 01:00:08,186
I watched a new movie called
‘Guava in the Gown’.

914
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:10,636
Phew! It was amazing!

915
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:26,915
Alright.

916
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,123
Gani is dead.

917
01:00:59,748 --> 01:01:01,206
But he’s nothing like the old Ganesh.

918
01:01:06,498 --> 01:01:07,748
Take him away...

919
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:09,248
He’s dead!

920
01:01:22,025 --> 01:01:22,941
Hello!

921
01:01:23,187 --> 01:01:24,812
You fired all the bullets at him.

922
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:26,398
You haven’t saved any for me.

923
01:01:27,447 --> 01:01:29,031
This reminds me of an old saying...

924
01:01:29,375 --> 01:01:31,041
When you have 4 bullets...

925
01:01:31,403 --> 01:01:33,430
Fire two and save two bullets.

926
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:46,248
Bro, give me one chance.

927
01:01:46,331 --> 01:01:47,498
I’ll kill him.

928
01:01:47,831 --> 01:01:48,873
Ganesh...

929
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:52,613
No alliance is working out for Bujjamma.
You have to marry her.

930
01:01:54,443 --> 01:01:57,169
- Only one chance, bro!
- Hey, you! Drop it.

931
01:01:57,239 --> 01:01:59,198
Come on, bro. I can’t wait any longer.

932
01:01:59,281 --> 01:02:01,573
I haven’t held the gun or murdered
anyone since I got here.

933
01:02:01,665 --> 01:02:03,873
Guys who came after me
are seasoned killers now.

934
01:02:03,998 --> 01:02:07,165
Friends mock me for being such a loser.

935
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,056
I need a boost in my career graph.

936
01:02:09,127 --> 01:02:11,586
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Shut up!

937
01:02:11,956 --> 01:02:12,748
Boss...

938
01:02:13,081 --> 01:02:15,206
let’s have a token system...
Allot tokens to everyone.

939
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:16,902
You commit a murder when your number comes.

940
01:02:17,002 --> 01:02:19,127
That’s better... No more fuss.
What do you say?

941
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:21,650
I have a better idea.
Let’s register a company...

942
01:02:21,748 --> 01:02:23,055
Get you all dressed in uniforms...

943
01:02:23,151 --> 01:02:25,389
And place a hoarding that reads
‘Visit us for the best murders’.

944
01:02:25,581 --> 01:02:27,956
- Superb, bro.
- Tokens, my foot! Bloody idiots!

945
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:30,415
You need guts to commit a murder...

946
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:31,998
Having a gun won’t cut it.

947
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,040
Yeah, right. Watching adult films,
that’s what real men do, right?

948
01:02:34,123 --> 01:02:35,415
- I don’t need you telling me.
- Hey!

949
01:02:35,623 --> 01:02:37,456
Are you out of your minds?
What’s the matter with you?

950
01:02:37,581 --> 01:02:39,456
He started it...

951
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,179
How dare you try to kill Gani?

952
01:02:44,753 --> 01:02:46,961
Well done, Kasi!
You did a great Jon.

953
01:02:47,418 --> 01:02:48,418
Hey!

954
01:02:48,517 --> 01:02:50,457
I want you two to get rid of the body.

955
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:53,938
That’s the punishment for creating chaos.

956
01:02:54,267 --> 01:02:56,350
Gani! I totally forgot to tell you.

957
01:02:56,665 --> 01:02:59,123
Weddings and murders go hand in hand.

958
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:02,040
Hey, first get rid of this old woman.
Good-riddance!

959
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:04,324
She doesn't let me kill in peace.

960
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,956
I’ve been hoping to murder someone
on Gani’s orders since 4 years.

961
01:03:12,099 --> 01:03:15,015
Gani bro noticed my passion and
gave me the name ‘Bullet Raja’.

962
01:03:15,081 --> 01:03:16,873
But you directly pointed a gun at me.

963
01:03:16,956 --> 01:03:18,290
I admire your guts.

964
01:03:18,534 --> 01:03:20,826
And could you please edit Taj Mahal
in the picture with my wife?

965
01:03:21,032 --> 01:03:23,240
I promised to take her there
when we fell in love.

966
01:03:25,408 --> 01:03:26,502
Damn life!

967
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:28,331
We drink to forget everything.

968
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:30,540
But memories hit you hard
when you’re drunk.

969
01:03:38,274 --> 01:03:39,649
It’s him... One second.

970
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:41,132
Hello, brother.

971
01:03:42,081 --> 01:03:43,125
I’m nearby.

972
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:45,916
I’ll be there...
I’m starting right away.

973
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:47,123
Thanks.

974
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,456
First time he called me directly.

975
01:03:49,623 --> 01:03:50,748
Thanks to you.

976
01:03:51,081 --> 01:03:52,094
What’s the matter?

977
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:55,415
Remember Modi sir’s Surgical Strike?

978
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:58,448
Ganesh bro will carry out the same
on the opposition leader tonight.

979
01:03:59,156 --> 01:04:00,364
He’s killing them all.

980
01:04:00,829 --> 01:04:01,787
Kill who?

981
01:04:01,935 --> 01:04:03,268
He can’t give names on the phone.

982
01:04:05,906 --> 01:04:07,573
Whatever... None of my business.

983
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:09,382
You wanted to show the pictures
to your wife, right?

984
01:04:09,474 --> 01:04:10,433
Hold on.

985
01:04:12,803 --> 01:04:14,678
Come fast...
Ganesh is waiting for me.

986
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:15,698
Coming.

987
01:04:15,765 --> 01:04:17,890
You didn’t give birth to a hero...

988
01:04:18,037 --> 01:04:19,329
But a second hero.

989
01:04:19,538 --> 01:04:22,339
I won’t let tears in your eyes.

990
01:04:22,581 --> 01:04:25,623
Hey! The black box I asked you to hide...

991
01:04:25,915 --> 01:04:27,373
- Where is it?
- It’s safe.

992
01:04:27,456 --> 01:04:28,665
I need it urgently... Give it.

993
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,873
I can’t even do my laundry in peace.

994
01:04:31,873 --> 01:04:32,956
What’s in it?

995
01:04:34,779 --> 01:04:35,779
Spy mic.

996
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:37,665
My uncle’s a reporter, remember?

997
01:04:38,123 --> 01:04:39,165
He gifted it to me.

998
01:04:40,581 --> 01:04:42,956
If we plant the receiver in the player

999
01:04:43,461 --> 01:04:44,545
and give it to someone...

1000
01:04:45,667 --> 01:04:49,459
We can listen to them up to 600 meters
through this antenna.

1001
01:04:49,665 --> 01:04:51,165
They are available online now.

1002
01:04:51,509 --> 01:04:53,926
You sound like the anchor
from TSM Teleshopping Network.

1003
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,448
What do we need it for?

1004
01:04:55,873 --> 01:04:58,206
Ganesh has planned to kill someone tonight.

1005
01:04:58,456 --> 01:04:59,998
If we give the receiver to ‘Bullet Raja’...

1006
01:05:00,248 --> 01:05:02,998
We can listen to the murder LIVE
through the antenna.

1007
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:04,206
Is it happening right now?

1008
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:06,071
I’m not done with my laundry yet.

1009
01:05:07,213 --> 01:05:07,963
Damn!

1010
01:05:08,248 --> 01:05:12,873
My second hero is doing his laundry
whilst a murder is in play.

1011
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,873
Here... All your photos are on this.

1012
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,623
Wow! We can watch photos on this?

1013
01:05:18,777 --> 01:05:19,861
You can watch movies as well.

1014
01:05:19,998 --> 01:05:21,706
Keep it for tonight and
return it in the morning.

1015
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:22,665
Sure.

1016
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:24,081
Thanks, boss... I’ll leave then.

1017
01:05:24,165 --> 01:05:25,956
It’s time. Brother is waiting on me.

1018
01:05:26,165 --> 01:05:28,124
Don’t forget to return it.
I have a lot of work to do.

1019
01:05:28,206 --> 01:05:29,237
Alright.

1020
01:05:32,038 --> 01:05:34,104
Hey! Let’s go.
We should stay within 600m of him.

1021
01:05:34,189 --> 01:05:35,364
What about my laundry?

1022
01:05:37,123 --> 01:05:38,415
Burn them.

1023
01:05:38,665 --> 01:05:40,290
Burn them to ashes.

1024
01:05:48,974 --> 01:05:51,141
It can’t be pouring now.

1025
01:05:51,649 --> 01:05:54,816
Rain is on our side. We’ll get it done.

1026
01:05:54,915 --> 01:05:55,998
What’s the matter?

1027
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:58,206
Boss called me directly for the first time.

1028
01:05:58,290 --> 01:05:59,165
What is it about?

1029
01:05:59,248 --> 01:06:02,456
You’re so desperate to hold a gun, right?

1030
01:06:02,836 --> 01:06:05,533
Boss wants you to handle the gun
in today’s plan...

1031
01:06:05,665 --> 01:06:06,859
- Really?
- Yeah.

1032
01:06:06,976 --> 01:06:08,934
You want to shoot people right? Do it!

1033
01:06:09,153 --> 01:06:11,028
Thanks, bro...
Does this mean I’m promoted?

1034
01:06:11,123 --> 01:06:12,748
- Yeah.
- So who are we going to kill?

1035
01:06:12,956 --> 01:06:14,123
Prabhakar.

1036
01:06:14,623 --> 01:06:15,665
Prabhakar?!

1037
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:18,188
‘Just two minutes.’

1038
01:06:20,206 --> 01:06:21,206
Who’s Prabhakar?

1039
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:23,560
He’s a goon from the other village...
He’s their rival.

1040
01:06:24,739 --> 01:06:26,739
He has a guesthouse in Adarsh Nagar...

1041
01:06:26,915 --> 01:06:28,165
He’s coming there tonight.

1042
01:06:30,706 --> 01:06:32,831
Our men have surrounded his guesthouse...

1043
01:06:33,206 --> 01:06:35,123
Our men have spotted him.

1044
01:06:37,487 --> 01:06:40,112
Go fill fuel in Ganesh bro’s vehicle.
We’ve got to rush.

1045
01:06:40,248 --> 01:06:42,123
- Get going... Come fast.
- Okay, bro.

1046
01:06:48,369 --> 01:06:50,036
I know where Adarsh Nagar is
on the Khammam Highway.

1047
01:06:50,248 --> 01:06:51,090
Shall we go?

1048
01:06:52,505 --> 01:06:54,838
If we go right away,
we’ll lose the spy mic signal...

1049
01:06:58,669 --> 01:07:00,502
It’s better we follow his car.

1050
01:07:54,225 --> 01:07:55,475
You always do this.

1051
01:07:57,437 --> 01:07:58,770
- What is it?
- Brother...

1052
01:07:59,177 --> 01:08:00,510
it’s ‘Bullet Raja’ speaking...

1053
01:08:00,814 --> 01:08:03,337
Leave Adarsh Nagar guesthouse right away.

1054
01:08:03,456 --> 01:08:06,665
What are you saying?
Gani and his gang are coming to kill you.

1055
01:08:06,857 --> 01:08:07,899
Oh no!

1056
01:08:08,963 --> 01:08:12,338
‘Bullet Raja’ leaked Gani’s plan
to Prabhakar.

1057
01:08:15,873 --> 01:08:16,831
Jack!

1058
01:08:17,081 --> 01:08:19,540
You leave me hanging all the time. Why?

1059
01:08:20,748 --> 01:08:22,873
Gani’s men are at the tea stall.

1060
01:08:23,456 --> 01:08:24,915
They have punctured your car Tyre.

1061
01:08:25,165 --> 01:08:26,540
Escape from there somehow.

1062
01:08:26,831 --> 01:08:28,915
If you get unlucky, chances are
I might kill you.

1063
01:08:29,373 --> 01:08:30,790
Hang on..

1064
01:08:34,295 --> 01:08:35,753
He delivered a super twist.

1065
01:08:36,708 --> 01:08:38,208
This will be the biggest twist in my film.

1066
01:08:40,499 --> 01:08:42,665
I’ll definitely be the second hero.

1067
01:09:04,748 --> 01:09:09,290
Lord, make sure this murder is hassle-free.

1068
01:09:38,373 --> 01:09:40,290
It’s not a police siren....
Just an ambulance.

1069
01:09:40,831 --> 01:09:41,998
You can enter.

1070
01:10:01,778 --> 01:10:02,570
Hey.

1071
01:10:24,732 --> 01:10:25,982
I can’t hear anything.

1072
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,014
Because they are not talking.

1073
01:10:48,529 --> 01:10:50,362
Brother, Prabhakar is not inside.

1074
01:10:51,785 --> 01:10:53,744
He’s really not in there.
We’ve looked everywhere.

1075
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:54,790
He must've escaped.

1076
01:10:54,915 --> 01:10:57,040
What the hell are you talking about?

1077
01:10:57,215 --> 01:10:58,298
What the hell!

1078
01:10:58,544 --> 01:11:00,169
Prabhakar must have escaped.

1079
01:11:04,623 --> 01:11:05,915
Escaped?!

1080
01:11:06,665 --> 01:11:08,248
Our men have surrounded the house...

1081
01:11:08,706 --> 01:11:10,248
We’ve punctured all his vehicles...

1082
01:11:10,804 --> 01:11:12,845
How did Prabhakar manage to escape?

1083
01:11:13,044 --> 01:11:14,961
How? How is it possible?

1084
01:11:16,254 --> 01:11:17,629
I think he escaped in the ambulance.

1085
01:11:20,597 --> 01:11:22,141
You didn't stop the ambulance?

1086
01:11:22,331 --> 01:11:24,415
We thought it must be an emergency...

1087
01:11:24,652 --> 01:11:25,652
What?

1088
01:11:26,351 --> 01:11:27,309
An emergency, huh?

1089
01:11:28,248 --> 01:11:30,123
What about our emergency?

1090
01:11:30,672 --> 01:11:32,089
What about our emergency?

1091
01:11:32,207 --> 01:11:38,665
Prabhakar’s murder is equally an emergency
as saving a life is.

1092
01:11:39,123 --> 01:11:40,581
Got it? Got it?

1093
01:11:41,165 --> 01:11:43,206
Prabhakar is a genius...

1094
01:11:43,456 --> 01:11:44,831
He escaped in the ambulance.

1095
01:11:45,646 --> 01:11:47,729
Ambulance must not have gone far.
Shall we go get him?

1096
01:11:49,586 --> 01:11:50,643
What?

1097
01:11:51,281 --> 01:11:52,893
Will you catch Prabhakar?

1098
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,706
- Yes...
- It’s Prabhakar.

1099
01:11:59,873 --> 01:12:00,843
Kasi!

1100
01:12:00,965 --> 01:12:02,669
He says he’ll catch Prabhakar.

1101
01:12:03,081 --> 01:12:04,165
Hey, Balija! Heard that?

1102
01:12:04,373 --> 01:12:06,748
He thinks he can catch Prabhakar.

1103
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:18,123
Balija, he doesn’t get it yet.

1104
01:12:19,159 --> 01:12:20,368
Hey, Bullet!

1105
01:12:20,706 --> 01:12:23,081
The sketch wasn’t meant for Prabhakar.

1106
01:12:23,456 --> 01:12:24,653
You were the target.

1107
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:26,260
Brother! Brother!

1108
01:12:38,081 --> 01:12:40,762
- Come. Come.
- Sit down!

1109
01:12:41,216 --> 01:12:42,383
Sit.

1110
01:12:44,165 --> 01:12:45,790
What was it again?
Prabhakar is a genius, huh?

1111
01:12:46,498 --> 01:12:47,665
Ganesh is the boss.

1112
01:12:48,402 --> 01:12:51,777
You can’t be loyal for
at least 10 months...

1113
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:54,331
But you dream of firing bullets
and become a don.

1114
01:12:54,748 --> 01:12:56,998
Brother, I want a gun to kill...

1115
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:58,706
You were annoying!

1116
01:13:00,081 --> 01:13:00,998
Kiddo...

1117
01:13:01,354 --> 01:13:02,929
Remember one thing...

1118
01:13:03,857 --> 01:13:07,732
It is the desperate one who’s often
affected the most.

1119
01:13:08,956 --> 01:13:10,081
It was a mistake...

1120
01:13:10,248 --> 01:13:11,915
I got greedy for money...

1121
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,373
I didn’t plot against you...

1122
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,014
He just wanted me to tip him off...

1123
01:13:15,123 --> 01:13:16,498
That’s all I did... That was it.

1124
01:13:16,706 --> 01:13:17,748
Oh, yeah?

1125
01:13:18,081 --> 01:13:20,331
You confess to tipping him off.

1126
01:13:20,927 --> 01:13:24,385
What about your murder plan
for me at the function?

1127
01:13:24,498 --> 01:13:26,373
He’s cleaning, brother... Go this way.

1128
01:13:28,581 --> 01:13:29,998
He’s coming your way.

1129
01:13:31,973 --> 01:13:35,098
You used your daughter’s birthday
to kill me.

1130
01:13:36,331 --> 01:13:37,790
What do you say now?
- It was a mistake, brother.

1131
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:39,456
I’m begging you...
I swear on my daughter.

1132
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:41,331
Please trust me for once.

1133
01:13:41,582 --> 01:13:43,790
Trust is life, kiddo.

1134
01:13:44,623 --> 01:13:48,081
You can’t earn trust once lost.

1135
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:51,149
Please let me go, brother.

1136
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:53,290
Please! I’m begging you...
Trust me.

1137
01:13:53,415 --> 01:13:55,831
Please, brother.
- Don’t cry, man. Just don’t.

1138
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,498
I might feel sorry for you.

1139
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:00,218
Alright... I won’t kill you.

1140
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:03,586
You’ve been longing for a gun, right?

1141
01:14:04,498 --> 01:14:06,206
Take it and shoot yourself.

1142
01:14:07,248 --> 01:14:08,248
Come on, do it.

1143
01:14:08,831 --> 01:14:09,998
Take it!

1144
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:19,646
Shoot yourself!

1145
01:15:00,248 --> 01:15:01,331
Poor guy!

1146
01:15:01,948 --> 01:15:03,364
They killed ‘Bullet Raja’.

1147
01:15:03,706 --> 01:15:05,748
We can’t stay here for long...
Let’s leave.

1148
01:15:05,873 --> 01:15:07,873
Come, let’s go. Come on!

1149
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:12,331
We found Prabhakar.

1150
01:15:13,662 --> 01:15:14,871
Wow!

1151
01:15:15,433 --> 01:15:17,308
We found the Titanic!

1152
01:15:19,623 --> 01:15:22,581
You can’t face me at the market…

1153
01:15:22,748 --> 01:15:24,706
So you used Penchalayya as cover...

1154
01:15:24,915 --> 01:15:28,165
But you were with a woman this time…
You should show your face…

1155
01:15:28,748 --> 01:15:29,956
How could you be such a coward?

1156
01:15:30,212 --> 01:15:31,796
Penchalayya planned the attack
at the function...

1157
01:15:31,915 --> 01:15:34,290
He led from the front...
I haven’t done anything wrong.

1158
01:15:34,415 --> 01:15:35,415
I swear!

1159
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,080
It’s wrong,

1160
01:15:37,292 --> 01:15:39,709
Killing you for Penchalayya’s plan
is wrong...

1161
01:15:40,081 --> 01:15:41,206
But I'll catch him soon...

1162
01:15:41,397 --> 01:15:44,314
And he’ll blame you for the attack...

1163
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:46,665
I’ll have to go looking for you again.

1164
01:15:48,915 --> 01:15:50,873
I’d still kill you then.

1165
01:15:51,706 --> 01:15:54,456
Killing you now will save me time.

1166
01:15:55,242 --> 01:15:57,075
My Headmaster told me this
when I was a kid.

1167
01:15:57,956 --> 01:16:00,040
Time is money!

1168
01:16:00,665 --> 01:16:03,593
I’ll do it your style…
I’ll wear this mask and kill you.

1169
01:16:12,956 --> 01:16:14,748
They killed Prabhakar.

1170
01:16:16,623 --> 01:16:17,665
Hey!

1171
01:16:18,572 --> 01:16:21,656
I didn’t bring you guys here
to kill these losers...

1172
01:16:22,373 --> 01:16:26,665
If anyone ever tries to plot against me...

1173
01:16:32,706 --> 01:16:34,956
He’ll kill us both. Let’s run away.

1174
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:35,873
Wait!

1175
01:16:37,123 --> 01:16:38,206
It’s a serious scene...

1176
01:16:38,623 --> 01:16:41,248
Let me watch till the end...
I mean, let me listen till the end.

1177
01:16:42,123 --> 01:16:44,665
Dump the bodies at the outskirts.

1178
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:48,998
Hey, what’s that?

1179
01:16:49,301 --> 01:16:50,843
Let’s leave. Come on.

1180
01:16:51,045 --> 01:16:52,253
- Please!
- Wait.

1181
01:16:54,956 --> 01:16:56,206
It’s an music player.

1182
01:16:58,248 --> 01:17:00,540
You can listen to songs and see pictures.

1183
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:04,081
Boss...

1184
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:05,456
It has a mic attached.

1185
01:17:08,831 --> 01:17:11,040
- So what?
- It has a receiver.

1186
01:17:11,873 --> 01:17:13,748
We can listen to everything he talks.

1187
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:18,248
Do you like the ending now?

1188
01:17:18,623 --> 01:17:19,831
Let’s get out of here!

1189
01:17:19,915 --> 01:17:22,790
Generally, police informers and
reporters use these.

1190
01:17:23,373 --> 01:17:25,956
They follow their targets closely
to gather information.

1191
01:17:26,231 --> 01:17:27,814
If I’m right...

1192
01:17:28,034 --> 01:17:30,784
Someone is listening to us right now.

1193
01:17:39,748 --> 01:17:40,790
Hey!

1194
01:17:41,498 --> 01:17:44,790
I don’t care who is listening to me...

1195
01:17:45,757 --> 01:17:47,966
You’ve listened to me talk till now...

1196
01:17:48,266 --> 01:17:49,976
I'll give you 10 minutes...

1197
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:53,873
Listen to whatever you want...

1198
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,498
I’ll kill you in the 11th minute.

1199
01:18:02,498 --> 01:18:03,998
Wherever you are...

1200
01:18:04,831 --> 01:18:09,123
I’ll hunt you down and kill you.

1201
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:11,748
He’ll kill us.

1202
01:18:12,331 --> 01:18:13,498
He will kill us.

1203
01:18:13,665 --> 01:18:14,915
I am coming...

1204
01:18:15,623 --> 01:18:17,206
You are going to die.

1205
01:18:43,024 --> 01:18:45,024
We can’t be here when they come...

1206
01:18:45,248 --> 01:18:46,415
Pack only important stuff.

1207
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:51,790
Mom and dad will find me dead
when they’re back from the pilgrimage.

1208
01:18:52,498 --> 01:18:54,706
Poor guys!
They’ll go looking for me.

1209
01:18:55,873 --> 01:18:57,665
They don’t even get to see me
one last time.

1210
01:19:01,726 --> 01:19:03,768
They found the mic...
But they don’t know us.

1211
01:19:04,748 --> 01:19:06,456
I’ll guard your life with mine.

1212
01:19:07,331 --> 01:19:08,341
Let’s go.

1213
01:19:08,831 --> 01:19:10,254
Where will we run?

1214
01:19:11,998 --> 01:19:14,415
They’ll find us somehow and kill us...

1215
01:19:14,665 --> 01:19:15,998
You’re from a different place...

1216
01:19:16,423 --> 01:19:17,748
You can just disappear...

1217
01:19:17,915 --> 01:19:21,248
But I was born and raised here...
I have to live here.

1218
01:19:22,206 --> 01:19:24,373
But they’ll kill me here.

1219
01:19:25,456 --> 01:19:28,498
I was tempted to be the second hero
despite knowing the stakes.

1220
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:31,530
I should blame myself...
I must die!

1221
01:19:31,623 --> 01:19:32,636
Hey!

1222
01:19:33,956 --> 01:19:35,915
Let’s die in his hands if we must.

1223
01:19:36,892 --> 01:19:38,184
But not like cowards.

1224
01:19:39,831 --> 01:19:40,873
Let’s go.

1225
01:19:42,956 --> 01:19:43,956
Lock it.

1226
01:20:14,248 --> 01:20:16,498
Sir! Sir! Please listen to me once.

1227
01:20:16,581 --> 01:20:18,373
- Please don't kill me!!
- Sir, please!

1228
01:20:35,736 --> 01:20:37,695
You were right about not shooting them...

1229
01:20:37,736 --> 01:20:39,320
They’ve brewed a huge plot.

1230
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:41,361
Someone powerful must be behind them.

1231
01:20:46,195 --> 01:20:47,653
Why are you still talking to them?

1232
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:48,945
Let’s just kill them.

1233
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:07,320
Wait.

1234
01:21:11,528 --> 01:21:12,736
He’s telling the truth.

1235
01:21:15,975 --> 01:21:17,495
Nobody sent us...

1236
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:19,986
I’m a movie director...
I’m here on that business.

1237
01:21:20,153 --> 01:21:22,945
Yes, sir...
I’m the second hero in his film.

1238
01:21:23,471 --> 01:21:24,762
Film director?

1239
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,445
Which films did you make?

1240
01:21:26,611 --> 01:21:27,945
I’ve made few short films...

1241
01:21:28,278 --> 01:21:29,903
I got the chance to debut
as a film director now.

1242
01:21:30,195 --> 01:21:31,611
That is why I came to your village.

1243
01:21:31,778 --> 01:21:34,361
Yes, sir. I’m the second hero in his film.

1244
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:37,820
When you’re lying,
at least make it sound obvious.

1245
01:21:37,986 --> 01:21:40,236
What’s a movie director doing
in our village?

1246
01:21:40,486 --> 01:21:41,986
I’m here to make a movie on you.

1247
01:21:42,903 --> 01:21:44,820
That is why I was collecting
information on you.

1248
01:21:44,903 --> 01:21:46,861
Yes, sir. I’m the second hero in his film.

1249
01:21:46,986 --> 01:21:48,028
Shut up!

1250
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:49,861
What?

1251
01:21:50,653 --> 01:21:51,695
You’re making a movie on me?!

1252
01:21:51,778 --> 01:21:53,570
I want to tell your story.

1253
01:21:54,236 --> 01:21:55,861
I’m in love with your character...

1254
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,111
Your heroism is extraordinary.

1255
01:22:03,028 --> 01:22:06,278
Is the movie like ‘Nayakudu’ and ‘Sarkar’?

1256
01:22:06,368 --> 01:22:08,493
Nah! I’m not a classy director, sir.

1257
01:22:10,403 --> 01:22:13,179
It’s more like ‘Don’ and ‘Dalapathi’...

1258
01:22:31,528 --> 01:22:32,653
Leave them.

1259
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:37,903
Hey! They’re one of us now...

1260
01:22:38,356 --> 01:22:40,040
They’re here to make a film on us…

1261
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:43,742
Make sure they get what they need.

1262
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:47,861
It’s a movie on Gaddalakonda Ganesh...
It must rock!

1263
01:22:49,695 --> 01:22:51,820
- What say?
- Whatever you say, sir.

1264
01:23:13,403 --> 01:23:15,653
The house looks really worn out...
He must’ve occupied it.

1265
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,320
- Who is she?
- That’s Ganesh’s mother.

1266
01:23:30,236 --> 01:23:32,153
Hello... I’m Abhi.

1267
01:23:32,695 --> 01:23:34,195
Everyone in the village resents your son...

1268
01:23:35,278 --> 01:23:37,486
But I’m here to thank you...

1269
01:23:38,403 --> 01:23:39,861
Whilst you brought him to the world...

1270
01:23:40,403 --> 01:23:42,320
His story brought my film to light.

1271
01:23:43,195 --> 01:23:45,028
You must watch my film
first day first show...

1272
01:23:45,778 --> 01:23:47,236
You gave birth to a powerhouse.

1273
01:23:48,361 --> 01:23:49,403
Thanks.

1274
01:24:14,778 --> 01:24:16,236
Hey... ready?

1275
01:24:16,486 --> 01:24:17,306
Ready.

1276
01:24:18,111 --> 01:24:19,153
Photo...

1277
01:24:20,028 --> 01:24:22,028
It’s not a photo shoot...
It’s a video recording.

1278
01:24:26,486 --> 01:24:29,070
Killing a fellow human being is barbaric,

1279
01:24:29,611 --> 01:24:31,403
atrocious and anarchic.

1280
01:24:31,653 --> 01:24:32,945
Did you ever feel the same?

1281
01:24:33,528 --> 01:24:37,195
When you kill a man,
what’s your state of mind?

1282
01:24:37,611 --> 01:24:38,820
Do you have any thoughts?

1283
01:24:40,626 --> 01:24:42,334
You kill a hen if you’re hungry.

1284
01:24:42,681 --> 01:24:44,929
Your kids think you’re a great father.

1285
01:24:45,406 --> 01:24:48,947
But the chicks feel you’re the monster
that killed their father.

1286
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,215
Murder is like killing a hen…

1287
01:24:51,646 --> 01:24:53,813
It’s fair on one side and
unfair on the other.

1288
01:24:54,226 --> 01:24:55,643
You get to choose...

1289
01:24:56,703 --> 01:24:57,745
which side you’re on.

1290
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:02,112
Have you never felt this is wrong?

1291
01:25:02,861 --> 01:25:05,861
I’ve never killed whenever
I had a feeling of guilt.

1292
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:08,903
That is why you guys are still
alive and kicking.

1293
01:25:09,101 --> 01:25:10,893
Amazing morals and ethics!

1294
01:25:11,403 --> 01:25:13,403
How many have you killed till date?

1295
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:17,736
I mean, how many murders
have you committed?

1296
01:25:20,404 --> 01:25:21,427
2...

1297
01:25:23,528 --> 01:25:24,614
5...

1298
01:25:25,111 --> 01:25:26,908
10, 11...

1299
01:25:27,371 --> 01:25:28,441
8...

1300
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:31,124
21, 22...

1301
01:25:31,236 --> 01:25:32,361
- 9...
- 14...

1302
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:33,486
23...

1303
01:25:33,699 --> 01:25:36,241
We killed 14 men at a carnival once.

1304
01:25:38,528 --> 01:25:41,028
Approximately 48 people.

1305
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:44,054
If I had killed you two last night...
It’d have been a half-century.

1306
01:25:44,278 --> 01:25:45,528
Psst! Bad luck!

1307
01:25:47,028 --> 01:25:49,028
When did all of this begin?

1308
01:25:49,195 --> 01:25:50,861
- At what age?
- I was very young...

1309
01:25:51,653 --> 01:25:53,486
I got into it when I was young.
- Whoa!

1310
01:25:53,853 --> 01:25:55,561
So you spent your youth killing people.

1311
01:25:55,913 --> 01:25:57,038
You’re a blessed soul.

1312
01:25:57,361 --> 01:25:59,153
What do you mean, huh?

1313
01:25:59,986 --> 01:26:01,028
Sorry, sir.

1314
01:26:01,986 --> 01:26:04,153
It’s been 30 years…

1315
01:26:04,403 --> 01:26:05,611
I think it’s longer...

1316
01:26:05,736 --> 01:26:07,903
Nah! Gani isn’t that old...
He just looks older.

1317
01:26:08,603 --> 01:26:10,186
Was I born in ’84 or ’86?

1318
01:26:10,835 --> 01:26:12,210
I guess it’s ’89 or ’90.

1319
01:26:12,316 --> 01:26:13,733
I don’t know the details...

1320
01:26:14,434 --> 01:26:15,976
I used to work in a bar back then...

1321
01:26:16,494 --> 01:26:18,744
A full bottle of Old rum costed 38 rupees.

1322
01:26:19,429 --> 01:26:21,929
A pack of cigarettes costed 1.70 rupees.

1323
01:26:22,236 --> 01:26:23,070
In those days.

1324
01:26:23,236 --> 01:26:25,403
It’s alright if you don’t remember
the year...

1325
01:26:26,163 --> 01:26:28,122
I’ll give a new intro to your flashback.

1326
01:26:28,715 --> 01:26:31,924
Because the villages, names,

1327
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:36,611
characters and timeline in this story...

1328
01:26:39,019 --> 01:26:40,728
They’re a work of fiction.

1329
01:26:41,644 --> 01:26:44,103
Full bottle rum costed 38 rupees...

1330
01:26:44,945 --> 01:26:47,320
A pack of cigarettes costed 1.70 rupees...

1331
01:26:47,861 --> 01:26:49,028
Those were the days.

1332
01:26:49,757 --> 01:26:51,840
Father died when I was a kid
from a drinking problem...

1333
01:26:52,361 --> 01:26:55,028
Mom sent me to school by selling coconuts
and flowers at a temple.

1334
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:57,352
- Bye, mom.
- We have to pay to go to school...

1335
01:26:57,529 --> 01:26:59,279
But we’re paid when we go to a bar...

1336
01:26:59,384 --> 01:27:00,988
That is why I’d be in the bar
most of the time.

1337
01:27:01,047 --> 01:27:03,148
- Bring me half brandy.
- Okay, bro.

1338
01:27:05,778 --> 01:27:07,861
Why didn’t you open it?
Where’s the opener?

1339
01:27:09,088 --> 01:27:11,505
Sir... Sir... Don’t hit him...
I’ll open it for you.

1340
01:27:12,870 --> 01:27:15,745
They promised to pay 2 rupees
if I opened the bottle...

1341
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:19,731
2 rupees turned to 20
if I thew the bottle on a car...

1342
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:49,548
Peddayya supported us...

1343
01:27:49,808 --> 01:27:51,968
So we backed him up.

1344
01:27:55,345 --> 01:27:57,192
20 rupess to throw a bottle.

1345
01:27:57,976 --> 01:27:59,536
200 rupees if we break a neck.

1346
01:28:01,839 --> 01:28:03,259
500 rupees if we break a hand.

1347
01:28:06,013 --> 01:28:08,000
1000 rupess if we break a head.

1348
01:28:10,695 --> 01:28:11,736
Stop it.

1349
01:28:12,945 --> 01:28:15,236
You started smashing bottles
when you were 5...

1350
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:18,820
But you did the same till
you were 17 or 18...

1351
01:28:19,236 --> 01:28:20,236
Not happening....

1352
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:21,945
I’m making a movie…

1353
01:28:22,736 --> 01:28:24,945
A hero needs a heroine, right?

1354
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,028
Don’t you have a heroine, I mean...

1355
01:28:29,736 --> 01:28:30,945
A girl in your life?

1356
01:28:31,696 --> 01:28:32,630
No!

1357
01:28:32,903 --> 01:28:34,611
- Gani, what are you saying?
- No!

1358
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,778
- Gani, listen...
- Hey!

1359
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,486
I said no, right? End of story.
Get the hell out.

1360
01:28:39,945 --> 01:28:40,986
Get lost!

1361
01:28:53,111 --> 01:28:55,528
When he insisted there was
no girl in his life...

1362
01:28:56,278 --> 01:28:58,361
It is clear there was someone.

1363
01:28:59,611 --> 01:29:00,736
Who is that girl?

1364
01:29:01,653 --> 01:29:02,778
Where is she?

1365
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:04,570
How does she look?

1366
01:29:08,361 --> 01:29:11,945
The second hero in the film
finds all the answers.

1367
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:18,018
Naughty boy! Continue...

1368
01:29:20,442 --> 01:29:21,817
Who is that girl?

1369
01:29:28,611 --> 01:29:29,903
Gani wants to see you.

1370
01:29:30,554 --> 01:29:31,637
Right now?

1371
01:29:31,723 --> 01:29:33,810
[OLD SONG PLAYING]

1372
01:29:51,759 --> 01:29:53,213
I lied to you this morning...

1373
01:29:55,271 --> 01:29:56,987
There was a girl in my life...

1374
01:29:59,673 --> 01:30:00,673
It’s her.

1375
01:30:04,903 --> 01:30:05,986
Sridevi?!

1376
01:30:13,361 --> 01:30:16,570
No matter how important a settlement was...

1377
01:30:17,195 --> 01:30:21,278
We’d skip everything for a Sridevi film.

1378
01:30:35,028 --> 01:30:36,736
- ‘Beauty Queen’ Sridevi...
- Hail!

1379
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:38,361
- ‘Beauty Queen’ Sridevi...
- Hail!

1380
01:30:38,486 --> 01:30:40,236
- ‘Beauty Queen’ Sridevi...
- Hail!

1381
01:30:40,895 --> 01:30:42,235
Darling!

1382
01:30:51,743 --> 01:30:53,723
Sridevi!

1383
01:30:55,253 --> 01:30:57,820
- Movie was mind-blowing, bro.
- I’m going to watch it a few more times.

1384
01:30:57,945 --> 01:31:00,028
By the way, Shoban Babu was getting
a little too touchy.

1385
01:31:07,911 --> 01:31:11,346
I really didn’t like Shoban Babu
getting intimate...

1386
01:31:11,446 --> 01:31:13,038
It’s just a movie...

1387
01:31:13,286 --> 01:31:15,606
Still, he should maintain his distance.

1388
01:31:16,028 --> 01:31:19,093
This is so not happening.
Let’s go to Madras and give him a warning.

1389
01:31:20,456 --> 01:31:22,790
Hey! Forget about ‘Reel’ Sridevi...
Kite is slipping away.

1390
01:31:23,711 --> 01:31:26,398
Catch it...
Sridevi I won't leave you.

1391
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:30,517
Run faster!
Hey.. Sridevi!

1392
01:32:05,278 --> 01:32:06,695
Devi... Devi...

1393
01:32:07,415 --> 01:32:08,623
Sridevi, listen!

1394
01:32:16,444 --> 01:32:17,630
Sridevi?

1395
01:32:18,018 --> 01:32:19,601
Hey! It’s Sridevi!

1396
01:32:38,945 --> 01:32:41,403
So this Sridevi took her place.

1397
01:32:41,736 --> 01:32:43,445
What happened after that?

1398
01:32:46,133 --> 01:32:47,873
Hey! Get out of here, everyone!

1399
01:32:48,034 --> 01:32:51,028
No more classes here... Get out!

1400
01:32:51,339 --> 01:32:53,855
- Who are you people?
-  Get out!

1401
01:32:54,103 --> 01:32:55,790
Get out of here...

1402
01:33:00,028 --> 01:33:02,695
Everyone’s switching to computers...

1403
01:33:02,784 --> 01:33:04,958
What will I do without this institute?

1404
01:33:09,695 --> 01:33:10,778
You’re right.

1405
01:33:11,153 --> 01:33:13,736
What will I do without this?

1406
01:33:15,028 --> 01:33:16,361
Hey, Type master...

1407
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:19,283
We’ll also be taking classes from tomorrow.

1408
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:22,276
- You guys will learn typing?
- Yeah.

1409
01:33:23,010 --> 01:33:24,344
We’re a different type.

1410
01:33:30,248 --> 01:33:32,289
- Let’s go, guys.
- Hey, Gani!

1411
01:33:34,953 --> 01:33:36,168
Who is he?

1412
01:33:49,186 --> 01:33:51,728
Ganesh bro, this is really heavy.

1413

That’s when the real problem started.

One day King Shanthanu was playing
on the banks of river Ganga.

Stop teasing her.
I will see your end.

why I’m hitting him now.

1587
01:49:18,131 --> 01:49:21,214
"This treasure is all yours, handsome"

1588
01:49:34,410 --> 01:49:37,170
Sridevi wanted to marry me...

1589
01:49:37,441 --> 01:49:41,008
While Peddayya was planning
a murder Gaddalakonda MLA.

1590
01:49:42,327 --> 01:49:44,674
Sridevi’s family found out
about our relationship.

1591
01:49:45,038 --> 01:49:46,358
It was really chaotic.

1592
01:49:49,527 --> 01:49:51,618
Sridevi convinced me to leave town.

1593
01:49:51,825 --> 01:49:53,612
We wanted to elope and get married.

1594
01:49:54,069 --> 01:49:55,253
Right about then...

1595
01:49:56,177 --> 01:49:58,817
- Alright, leave after this murder...
- No.

1596
01:49:59,594 --> 01:50:01,302
I'm quitting it now.

1597
01:50:02,274 --> 01:50:04,744
You’ll find many people like me...

1598
01:50:05,515 --> 01:50:08,835
But I’m all that Devi’s got.

1599
01:50:14,351 --> 01:50:15,705
Please let me go.

1600
01:50:17,771 --> 01:50:18,878
Let's go Kasi.

1601
01:50:22,172 --> 01:50:23,314
Sir!

1602
01:50:24,004 --> 01:50:25,024
Tell me...

1603
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:27,549
Gani wants to quit...

1604
01:50:27,743 --> 01:50:29,743
Anything you can do about that?

1605
01:50:30,038 --> 01:50:31,464
He’s going to the railway station.

1606
01:50:39,796 --> 01:50:41,629
Find him. Go this way.

1607
01:50:43,022 --> 01:50:45,022
Check in the compartment...
- Okay.

1608
01:50:45,122 --> 01:50:46,349
Check there.

1609
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:49,750
- Did you find him?
- No.

1610
01:50:49,976 --> 01:50:51,776
- They are not here also.
- Okay let's go.

1611
01:50:55,823 --> 01:50:56,750
Devi.

1612
01:50:58,754 --> 01:50:59,829
Devi!

1613
01:51:01,345 --> 01:51:02,507
Devi, I’m here!

1614
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:06,120
Gani...

1615
01:51:11,588 --> 01:51:12,834
Devi! Where are you?

1616
01:51:28,957 --> 01:51:30,117
Devi!

1617
01:51:32,882 --> 01:51:35,202
I can’t suffocate you for long...

1618
01:51:36,166 --> 01:51:37,859
I’ll take my hand off now...

1619
01:51:38,452 --> 01:51:42,335
Come with me without calling out for him...

1620
01:51:42,969 --> 01:51:45,157
I’ll make sure Gani is alive.

1621
01:51:49,317 --> 01:51:52,214
If you call him or yell out his name...

1622
01:51:52,736 --> 01:51:55,314
I’ll also make sure he’s dead.

1623
01:52:38,554 --> 01:52:43,030
Make sure Devi doesn't recognize him.

1624
01:53:11,514 --> 01:53:13,213
You never saw her after that?

1625
01:53:14,898 --> 01:53:17,490
Only after she told him to forget her...

1626
01:53:17,815 --> 01:53:19,108
They let Gani go.

1627
01:53:19,441 --> 01:53:20,334
Who did it?

1628
01:53:20,455 --> 01:53:22,258
After harassing me for 3 days,

1629
01:53:22,990 --> 01:53:24,545
they let me go.

1630
01:53:25,769 --> 01:53:27,500
He is Gaddalakonda’s sitting MLA.

1631
01:53:28,029 --> 01:53:29,459
He’s bailing you out.

1632
01:53:30,667 --> 01:53:33,219
I don’t know why you chose to forgive me...

1633
01:53:33,623 --> 01:53:35,633
But you’re the reason I’m alive today.

1634
01:53:36,717 --> 01:53:39,494
I’ll look after the politics
in Gaddalakonda hereafter.

1635
01:53:40,314 --> 01:53:41,735
You look after the settlements.

1636
01:53:42,911 --> 01:53:44,029
One more thing, Ganesh...

1637
01:53:44,423 --> 01:53:47,327
Peddayya tipped off the Cops.

1638
01:53:51,794 --> 01:53:52,855
Peddayya!

1639
01:54:08,886 --> 01:54:11,997
Your Honor...
This case needs no evidence...

1640
01:54:12,512 --> 01:54:15,108
That’s because the accuser’s mother
is the witness.

1641
01:54:15,991 --> 01:54:18,621
Ganesh killed brutally while
his mother was watching.

1642
01:54:18,843 --> 01:54:19,859
Judge sir...

1643
01:54:21,249 --> 01:54:22,495
My mom is mute...

1644
01:54:25,404 --> 01:54:26,647
She can’t speak.

1645
01:54:29,916 --> 01:54:33,148
9 x 2 = 18

1646
01:54:33,271 --> 01:54:35,061
9 x 3 = 27

1647
01:54:35,183 --> 01:54:37,323
9 x 3 = 27

1648
01:54:42,518 --> 01:54:46,891
In this case of Gaddalakonda Ganesh
and Peddayya alias Ramachandra Murthy...

1649
01:54:47,252 --> 01:54:49,698
Due to the lack of strong evidence...

1650
01:54:50,165 --> 01:54:53,857
Ganesh is declared not guilty
and the case is thus closed.

1651
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:58,918
Because I claimed my mother to be mute...

1652
01:54:59,911 --> 01:55:02,643
She hasn’t spoken to me ever since.

1653
01:55:05,062 --> 01:55:07,139
If you had found Sridevi that night...

1654
01:55:08,986 --> 01:55:10,612
You wouldn’t have been the same person.

1655
01:55:10,783 --> 01:55:12,498
Life is so unfair, bro...

1656
01:55:13,197 --> 01:55:15,097
We can only hope for a better life...

1657
01:55:15,801 --> 01:55:17,211
You never know what hits you.

1658
01:55:18,816 --> 01:55:20,517
How’s your research coming along?

1659
01:55:20,685 --> 01:55:22,640
I’m done, uncle...
Script is almost ready.

1660
01:55:23,057 --> 01:55:24,461
I’ll have to start shooting.

1661
01:55:24,890 --> 01:55:27,003
Did you find the information on Ganesh?

1662
01:55:27,167 --> 01:55:28,389
Of course, uncle...

1663
01:55:28,784 --> 01:55:32,419
He told me all about his murders
and other crimes...

1664
01:55:33,009 --> 01:55:34,182
I’ve recorded everything.

1665
01:55:34,270 --> 01:55:35,731
Okay... Come back soon.

1666
01:55:35,931 --> 01:55:36,886
Okay.

1667
01:55:42,015 --> 01:55:43,042
Hello...

1668
01:55:43,322 --> 01:55:44,900
- Is IG available?
- Who are you?

1669
01:55:45,049 --> 01:55:46,652
This is Reporter Madhav Rao speaking...

1670
01:55:46,726 --> 01:55:47,993
One moment, hold on...

1671
01:55:48,522 --> 01:55:50,596
- Hello...
- Hello, sir...

1672
01:55:50,904 --> 01:55:53,006
This is Madhav Rao...
- Yes, tell me...

1673
01:55:53,305 --> 01:55:56,935
The information you wanted
is on tape and video.

1674
01:55:57,141 --> 01:55:58,781
I think you can proceed now.

1675
01:55:59,342 --> 01:56:02,414
I came looking for a gangster’s story...
And surprisingly, I found a love story.

1676
01:56:02,489 --> 01:56:03,763
I’m your lucky charm.

1677
01:56:04,257 --> 01:56:06,067
Is that why you chose to ignore
our love story?

1678
01:56:07,997 --> 01:56:09,479
I don’t want to interfere
in between you two.

1679
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:11,302
I’ll get into trouble.

1680
01:56:14,228 --> 01:56:16,300
Few love stories are meant for movies only.

1681
01:56:16,751 --> 01:56:18,170
They cause pain in real life.

1682
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:20,690
True... It’s painful.

1683
01:56:21,057 --> 01:56:24,714
You used Balijayya, Gani and me
for your story.

1684
01:56:25,388 --> 01:56:27,041
You took advantage. Am I right?

1685
01:56:27,203 --> 01:56:28,875
if I wanted to take advantage of you...

1686
01:56:34,748 --> 01:56:36,228
I like you, Bujjamma...

1687
01:56:36,775 --> 01:56:38,227
But film is my first love.

1688
01:56:39,053 --> 01:56:40,801
I’m committed towards my craft...

1689
01:56:41,896 --> 01:56:44,332
So I can’t commit to our relationship.

1690
01:56:45,019 --> 01:56:46,938
Does this mean the end of our story?

1691
01:56:47,305 --> 01:56:49,201
Let me put it in your words...

1692
01:56:49,429 --> 01:56:51,499
Is this the interval in our love story?

1693
01:56:51,832 --> 01:56:52,919
Or the end?

1694
01:56:54,338 --> 01:56:57,245
Not all stories on paper transcend
on the silver screen.

1695
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:00,181
This isn’t the interval

1696
01:57:01,234 --> 01:57:02,280
or the end.

1697
01:57:02,943 --> 01:57:06,985
It’s a beautiful love story that’s shelved.

1698
01:57:09,164 --> 01:57:12,717
Let me see how you’ll make a movie
after hurting me so much...

1699
01:57:12,883 --> 01:57:14,796
Hey! Hey, Bujjamma!

1700
01:57:20,835 --> 01:57:24,016
Guys! Abhi is leaving to Hyderabad
tomorrow.

1701
01:57:24,873 --> 01:57:27,061
He’s making a movie on me...

1702
01:57:27,622 --> 01:57:30,659
Enjoy the food and alcohol...

1703
01:57:30,997 --> 01:57:32,023
Have fun!

1704
01:57:58,642 --> 01:58:00,568
“I’m a little good”

1705
01:58:00,643 --> 01:58:02,499
“I’m a little evil”

1706
01:58:02,633 --> 01:58:04,559
“This is who I am”

1707
01:58:04,701 --> 01:58:06,594
“Even the moon is flawed”

1708
01:58:06,687 --> 01:58:08,585
“I cause terror”

1709
01:58:08,678 --> 01:58:10,512
“I create chaos”

1710
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:12,466
“Mess with me, kiddo”

1711
01:58:12,526 --> 01:58:14,459
“And I’ll break your bones”

1712
01:58:14,532 --> 01:58:16,333
“Set my heart on fire”

1713
01:58:16,582 --> 01:58:18,515
"Kiss me on the cheek"

1714
01:58:18,691 --> 01:58:22,488
“Bottoms up and forget all worries”

1715
01:58:22,689 --> 01:58:24,474
“Shoot your glances”

1716
01:58:24,628 --> 01:58:26,628
“Set things straight”

1717
01:58:26,697 --> 01:58:30,574
“There’s no right or wrong in this game”

1718
01:58:30,691 --> 01:58:32,577
“Oh, my swaying waist”

1719
01:58:32,691 --> 01:58:35,163
“It grooves to your gaze”

1720
01:58:38,704 --> 01:58:40,583
“Your height is a super hit”

1721
01:58:40,690 --> 01:58:42,616
“Your route is a super hit”

1722
01:58:42,674 --> 01:58:44,623
“Your head weight is a super hit”

1723
01:58:44,694 --> 01:58:46,523
“This movie is a super hit”

1724
01:58:46,603 --> 01:58:48,592
“Your mustache is a super hit”

1725
01:58:48,657 --> 01:58:50,641
"Your machismo is a super hit"

1726
01:58:50,666 --> 01:58:52,571
“Your whistle is a super hit”

1727
01:58:52,696 --> 01:58:54,586
“Your style is a super hit”

1728
01:58:54,693 --> 01:58:56,513
“I’m a little good”

1729
01:58:56,670 --> 01:58:58,519
“I’m a little evil”

1730
01:58:58,664 --> 01:59:00,574
“This is who I am”

1731
01:59:00,705 --> 01:59:02,642
“Even the moon is flawed”

1732
01:59:02,728 --> 01:59:04,597
“I cause terror”

1733
01:59:04,684 --> 01:59:06,547
“I create chaos”

1734
01:59:06,649 --> 01:59:08,529
“Mess with me, kiddo”

1735
01:59:08,659 --> 01:59:10,915
“And I’ll break your bones”

1736
01:59:34,983 --> 01:59:36,605
“Mess with me once”

1737
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:40,608
“I'll destroy your life”

1738
01:59:43,065 --> 01:59:44,709
“It will be the end of you”

1739
01:59:46,674 --> 01:59:50,476
“Peoples fear is your strength”

1740
01:59:50,611 --> 01:59:54,330
“Your courage is your wealth”

1741
01:59:54,906 --> 01:59:58,480
“I win everything I set my eyes on”

1742
01:59:58,547 --> 02:00:00,607
“Your height is a super hit”

1743
02:00:00,675 --> 02:00:02,581
“Your route is a super hit”

1744
02:00:02,675 --> 02:00:04,581
“Your head weight is a super hit”

1745
02:00:04,695 --> 02:00:06,460
“This movie is a super hit”

1746
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:08,567
“Your mustache is a super hit”

1747
02:00:08,681 --> 02:00:10,588
"Your machismo is a super hit"

1748
02:00:10,675 --> 02:00:12,574
“Your whistle is a super hit”

1749
02:00:12,652 --> 02:00:14,465
“Your style is a super hit”

1750
02:00:14,591 --> 02:00:16,544
“I’m a little good”

1751
02:00:16,614 --> 02:00:18,513
“I’m a little evil”

1752
02:00:18,645 --> 02:00:20,356
“This is who I am”

1753
02:00:20,468 --> 02:00:22,571
“Even the moon is flawed”

1754
02:00:22,697 --> 02:00:24,599
“I cause terror”

1755
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:26,528
“I create chaos”

1756
02:00:26,661 --> 02:00:28,543
“Mess with me, kiddo”

1757
02:00:28,611 --> 02:00:30,704
“And I’ll break your bones”

1758
02:00:36,399 --> 02:00:37,425
Get lost!

1759
02:00:40,583 --> 02:00:41,510
Hey, Abhi!

1760
02:00:41,649 --> 02:00:44,184
Who’s the hero in your film?
Pawan Kalyan or Mahesh Babu?

1761
02:00:45,762 --> 02:00:46,775
Hey, old woman!

1762
02:00:47,187 --> 02:00:49,187
You know Ganesh since he was a kid...

1763
02:00:49,381 --> 02:00:51,210
Who would play him better?

1764
02:00:51,387 --> 02:00:53,779
My choices would be Ramarao
and Nageswara Rao...

1765
02:00:53,879 --> 02:00:55,879
Thank god she didn’t say Chittoor Nagayya.

1766
02:00:55,952 --> 02:00:57,187
You choose someone.

1767
02:00:57,354 --> 02:00:59,594
What do I know about present heroes?

1768
02:00:59,769 --> 02:01:00,937
Ask Bujjamma.

1769
02:01:01,237 --> 02:01:03,339
She watches TV all the time.

1770
02:01:08,424 --> 02:01:10,910
It’s your story.
Why would they cast someone else?

1771
02:01:11,096 --> 02:01:12,209
You must be the Hero.

1772
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:26,066
Bujjamma, that’s a superb joke.

1773
02:01:26,212 --> 02:01:28,641
Ganesh playing the hero...? Action!

1774
02:01:31,550 --> 02:01:33,643
Hello... I am not joking.

1775
02:01:34,461 --> 02:01:35,611
Ganesh is nothing less...

1776
02:01:35,712 --> 02:01:37,778
He’s tall, dark and handsome.

1777
02:01:38,364 --> 02:01:40,241
- He looks like a hero.
- Hello.

1778
02:01:40,587 --> 02:01:42,791
Not everyone tall becomes a hero...

1779
02:01:43,212 --> 02:01:44,758
You need talent to act...

1780
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:47,100
You need to have the guts
to stand in front of the camera.

1781
02:01:47,623 --> 02:01:49,916
Once I make up my mind...

1782
02:01:50,389 --> 02:01:54,918
I’ll face anyone and anything.

1783
02:01:56,345 --> 02:01:59,224
I’m the hero in your film!

1784
02:01:59,434 --> 02:02:00,677
This is fixed!

1785
02:02:02,742 --> 02:02:03,815
Hero!

1786
02:02:04,251 --> 02:02:05,760
I’m the hero.

1787
02:02:07,463 --> 02:02:09,553
Gani, what are you talking about?

1788
02:02:09,861 --> 02:02:11,140
With this...

1789
02:02:11,454 --> 02:02:14,074
The whole world will know
who Gaddalakonda Ganesh is.

1790
02:02:14,968 --> 02:02:16,041
People will know...

1791
02:02:16,934 --> 02:02:17,940
They will know me.

1792
02:02:18,305 --> 02:02:20,389

Hey, you!

1794
02:02:22,902 --> 02:02:24,943
You listened to the story I narrated...

1795
02:02:25,281 --> 02:02:27,802
But why should I listen to you?

1796
02:02:28,915 --> 02:02:32,470
I’m not asking if I can be your hero...

1797
02:02:33,399 --> 02:02:35,941
I’m the hero in your film.

1798
02:02:37,009 --> 02:02:39,100
Okay?

1799
02:02:39,563 --> 02:02:40,700
Okay?

1800
02:02:43,073 --> 02:02:45,734
Guys! Director says okay.
Applause!

[CHEERING GANESH]

1802
02:02:49,737 --> 02:02:51,277

- Ganesh!
- Hero!

1806
02:03:09,292 --> 02:03:10,628
What does he think of himself?

1807
02:03:10,875 --> 02:03:12,039
He can’t be a hero overnight.

1808
02:03:12,192 --> 02:03:14,393
He might be good at killing people.
But movies are a different avenue.

1809
02:03:15,414 --> 02:03:17,394
Why don’t you compromise for your debut?

1810
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:19,688
I am in this industry because
I can’t compromise in life.

1811
02:03:20,313 --> 02:03:22,112
How can I compromise with my films?

1812
02:03:23,533 --> 02:03:26,953
Angst kills both ideas and opportunities.

1813
02:03:27,995 --> 02:03:30,121
Oh. I see you are also preaching now.

1814
02:03:32,189 --> 02:03:34,407
Even an adult films operator
is out to teach me.

1815
02:03:36,661 --> 02:03:38,287
This theater also belongs to Ganesh...

1816
02:03:38,990 --> 02:03:40,990
He wanted to renovate it into
a wedding hall...

1817
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:46,637
But I requested him to postpone the plan...
Asked him to wait till I die.

1818
02:03:47,865 --> 02:03:49,830
Dirty or Divine...
Movies should keep playing...

1819
02:03:50,863 --> 02:03:55,062
This heart beats only as long as
the projector runs.

1820
02:03:57,062 --> 02:03:58,900
I'm crazy about films.

1821
02:04:01,107 --> 02:04:03,483
My dad worked as an operator
in the same theater...

1822
02:04:04,345 --> 02:04:06,345
That is when my movie madness begun...

1823
02:04:06,740 --> 02:04:08,607
That madness drove me to Madras...

1824
02:04:08,857 --> 02:04:11,199
That madness made me
an Assistant Director in 6 months.

1825
02:04:11,324 --> 02:04:12,870
And Director in 6 years...

1826
02:04:13,024 --> 02:04:14,205

The story that was coming to life...

1830
02:04:22,608 --> 02:04:24,236
And the Producer said
his brother-in-law is the villain.

1831
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:26,879
I wanted to cast Mr. Ravu Gopal Rao.

1832
02:04:27,013 --> 02:04:28,505
I tried convincing him...
But he never listened to me...

1833
02:04:29,068 --> 02:04:30,385
I didn't want to listen to him...

1834
02:04:30,642 --> 02:04:32,088
I left the office in a rage.

1835
02:04:32,155 --> 02:04:33,815
Damn! What did you do?

1836
02:04:34,022 --> 02:04:37,132
I thought I’d find a new producer...

1837
02:04:37,265 --> 02:04:39,444
I thought I’d find some chance.

1838
02:04:42,376 --> 02:04:44,529
But I never got that chance.

1839
02:04:46,293 --> 02:04:47,579
Before I die...

1840
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:52,860
I wish to hold the megaphone
once and say ‘Action!’

1841
02:04:54,533 --> 02:04:55,500
But...

02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:58,948

We try to lose the hardship.

1847
02:05:12,759 --> 02:05:14,809
We end up losing the opportunity.

There’s no director that hasn’t suffered...

1849
02:05:16,993 --> 02:05:21,552

cry, applaud and whistle.

1851

Don’t make the same mistake I did.

- Uh-huh.
- Am I right, uncle?

I’m asking you to adjust...

1858
02:05:42,382 --> 02:05:45,502
If you quit film making and find a day job,
that’s compromise...

1859
02:05:45,956 --> 02:05:48,268
If you make this film from
a different viewpoint...

1860
02:05:48,588 --> 02:05:49,755

the hero of this film.

We will also learn to act.

1938
02:09:19,106 --> 02:09:21,272
- We’ll give him company.
- Yeah. I’ll also join.

1939
02:09:21,479 --> 02:09:22,672
I know I don’t need it...

1940
02:09:22,806 --> 02:09:25,362
Still, life is a never-ending lesson.
So I’ll join.

1941
02:09:25,556 --> 02:09:28,259
Okay. Interested people, give your names.

1942
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:31,195
But we go on floors only
after Master approves.

1943
02:09:31,430 --> 02:09:33,293
He will approve. Why wouldn’t he?

1944
02:09:33,506 --> 02:09:35,041
We’ll force him to approve.

1945
02:09:38,902 --> 02:09:40,902
Introducing one and only Muni Manikyam sir.

1946
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:42,306
Your acting teacher.

1947
02:09:50,582 --> 02:09:51,610
Good morning, teacher...

1948
02:09:51,677 --> 02:09:53,923
You thought that was a welcome gesture?

1949
02:09:54,630 --> 02:09:55,993
It is a yoga posture.

1950
02:09:58,306 --> 02:09:59,739
So my dear boys...

1951
02:09:59,906 --> 02:10:03,334
In the ‘Rangasthalam (Dais)’ of the world...
We’re all actors.

1952
02:10:03,491 --> 02:10:04,897
But Ramcharan starred in ‘Rangasthalam’.

1953
02:10:05,098 --> 02:10:06,209
Why did you include us?

1954
02:10:06,306 --> 02:10:08,183
Shut your mouth and listen up, okay?

1955
02:10:13,171 --> 02:10:15,237
Idiot! Scoundrel! Rascal!

1956
02:10:15,337 --> 02:10:17,717
How dare you!
Smoking in front of us?!

1957
02:10:19,471 --> 02:10:20,990
You! Come forward!

1958
02:10:21,235 --> 02:10:23,551
How dare you smoke in front of me?

1959
02:10:24,602 --> 02:10:26,369
Hey! Let him go.

1960
02:10:26,708 --> 02:10:28,708
Let him go...
Please. Please.

1961
02:10:28,837 --> 02:10:30,123
Hey... No. No.

1962
02:10:30,450 --> 02:10:32,137
Ganesh sir, please spare him.

1963
02:10:32,374 --> 02:10:33,340
Please.

1964
02:10:38,825 --> 02:10:40,869
It was a mistake, Master. I’m sorry.

1965
02:10:40,991 --> 02:10:44,785
Guys! Cut him some slack
until the training ends.

1966
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:47,574
Does that mean you’ll kill me
after training?

1967
02:10:48,385 --> 02:10:49,597
Please don’t do that sir...

1968
02:10:49,983 --> 02:10:51,686
I’m begging you.

1969
02:10:51,834 --> 02:10:54,782
I’m begging you.
Please don’t kill me.

1970
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:01,205
You guys thought I was scared? Huh?

1971
02:11:01,347 --> 02:11:03,380
I just enacted the emotion of ‘fear’.

1972
02:11:03,521 --> 02:11:05,444
He who fears can never be an actor.

1973
02:11:05,745 --> 02:11:06,934
I’m an artist!

1974
02:11:07,228 --> 02:11:08,540
How many people can you scare?

1975
02:11:08,693 --> 02:11:10,540
10? 100? 1000?

1976
02:11:10,694 --> 02:11:13,524
We’re entertaining millions of people...

1977
02:11:13,751 --> 02:11:16,190
An artist is more powerful
than a factionist.

1978
02:11:16,477 --> 02:11:17,430
Okay?

1979
02:11:17,867 --> 02:11:20,165
Gani... Say the word, I'll kill him here.

1980
02:11:20,311 --> 02:11:21,404
Not now...

1981
02:11:22,419 --> 02:11:24,632
So your classes begin at 4 am.

1982
02:11:25,072 --> 02:11:27,091
Your training starts at 4 sharp.

1983
02:11:27,212 --> 02:11:29,788
Whoa! That’s too early, sir.

1984
02:11:31,209 --> 02:11:32,922
If 4 AM is too early...
3 AM sounds better then.

1985
02:11:33,036 --> 02:11:34,736
Sharp 3 AM. Got it?

1986
02:11:35,258 --> 02:11:36,313
Got it, sir.

1987
02:11:36,417 --> 02:11:38,530
These illiterates didn’t get it, sir.

1988
02:11:39,761 --> 02:11:41,367
I’m talking about acting...

1989
02:11:41,687 --> 02:11:43,124
Not over acting.

1990
02:11:43,456 --> 02:11:45,285
Shut up and be there at 3 AM. Got it?

1991
02:11:45,473 --> 02:11:46,719
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah?

1992
02:11:46,977 --> 02:11:48,056
Yes sir.

1993
02:11:48,288 --> 02:11:49,295
Good.

1994
02:11:49,460 --> 02:11:50,473
Okay sir.

1995
02:11:58,068 --> 02:11:59,154
Stop!

1996
02:12:00,412 --> 02:12:02,532
Now, in slow motion.

1997
02:12:11,460 --> 02:12:12,926
Stop showing off... Step back.

1998
02:12:17,770 --> 02:12:18,782
Anger!

1999
02:12:19,029 --> 02:12:20,142
More anger.

2000
02:12:21,235 --> 02:12:22,501
I want to see anger...

2001
02:12:23,273 --> 02:12:24,614
Extremes of anger!

2002
02:12:24,842 --> 02:12:26,202
Tons of anger!

2003
02:12:26,361 --> 02:12:27,420
Hey!

2004
02:12:28,935 --> 02:12:29,948
Gani sir...

2005
02:12:31,108 --> 02:12:32,281
Cool... Cool.

2006
02:12:32,502 --> 02:12:33,769
It’s okay... It’s okay.

2007
02:12:34,010 --> 02:12:35,236
Sir, are you okay?

2008
02:12:35,603 --> 02:12:37,995
Show me compassion. No anger.

2009
02:12:39,286 --> 02:12:40,523
Love! Love!

2010
02:12:43,364 --> 02:12:45,489
They’re the top villains
in the Telugu film industry...

2011
02:12:46,538 --> 02:12:48,080
Some of them don’t even speak
the language...

2012
02:12:48,488 --> 02:12:50,571
But they know body language.

2013
02:12:50,878 --> 02:12:52,337
That is why they’re successful.

2014
02:12:56,120 --> 02:12:57,536
Sivaji Rao Gayakwad!

2015
02:12:57,628 --> 02:13:00,045
Born in Maharashtra, worked as
a conductor in Karnataka...

2016
02:13:00,212 --> 02:13:02,295
Became a super star in Tamil Nadu.

2017
02:13:02,887 --> 02:13:06,762
Language was not a barrier from him...

2018
02:13:07,387 --> 02:13:09,304
That is why he made the film ‘Basha’, sir.

2019
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:13,554
Abhi, can you handle this?

2020
02:13:13,679 --> 02:13:14,760
Sure, sir.

2021
02:13:15,012 --> 02:13:15,993
Come here.

2022
02:13:20,345 --> 02:13:21,084
Yes?

2023
02:13:21,174 --> 02:13:23,340
‘Bhasha’ means language.

2024
02:13:23,730 --> 02:13:25,605
‘Basha’ is a movie.

2025
02:13:25,806 --> 02:13:27,473
‘Bhasha’ means language.

2026
02:13:28,054 --> 02:13:29,095
Rajnikanth. Rajnikanth.

2027
02:13:29,220 --> 02:13:30,554
Sorry. ‘Basha’ is a film.

2028
02:13:39,009 --> 02:13:39,979
So...

2029
02:13:40,387 --> 02:13:43,762
I have a small drill to practice
body language.

2030
02:13:44,845 --> 02:13:46,679
(a+b)²=

2031
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:49,304
I’m not done yet! I’m not done yet!

2032
02:13:56,470 --> 02:13:59,137
Gani, he’s crossing the line.
Just stay calm.

2033
02:13:59,637 --> 02:14:01,762
(a+b)²=

2034
02:14:02,005 --> 02:14:04,380
a² + b² + 2ab

2035
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:07,054
Simple formula... You must be knowing it.

2036
02:14:08,137 --> 02:14:09,220
For example...

2037
02:14:09,887 --> 02:14:11,095
Abhi...
- Sir?

2038
02:14:11,304 --> 02:14:12,516
Let’s begin the show.

2039
02:14:12,672 --> 02:14:17,338
- Anger!
- (a+b)²=  a² + b² + 2ab

2040
02:14:18,512 --> 02:14:21,345
- Lust!
- (a+b)²=

2041
02:14:21,929 --> 02:14:26,970
a² + b² + 2ab

2042
02:14:27,355 --> 02:14:28,272
Sorrow!

2043
02:14:28,429 --> 02:14:31,345
(a+b)²=

2044
02:14:32,321 --> 02:14:35,693
a² + b² + 2ab

2045
02:14:38,345 --> 02:14:40,345
2ab...

2046
02:14:42,387 --> 02:14:43,095
So, guys!

2047
02:14:43,179 --> 02:14:45,470
If you want coffee or dosa...

2048
02:14:45,595 --> 02:14:47,220
If it’s an enquiry or a threat...

2049
02:14:47,304 --> 02:14:48,595
Be it public or private...

2050
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:51,095
You must follow this formula.

2051
02:14:51,554 --> 02:14:52,679
Choose fast.

2052
02:14:52,845 --> 02:14:53,762
You want her or me?

2053
02:14:53,804 --> 02:14:58,971
(a+b)²=  a² + b² + 2ab

2054
02:14:59,179 --> 02:15:00,262
2ab!

2055
02:15:00,345 --> 02:15:02,847
What the hell are you talking about?
You fool!

2056
02:15:02,970 --> 02:15:04,387
Whole square...

2057
02:15:05,012 --> 02:15:06,345
I get it, sister.

2058
02:15:06,470 --> 02:15:09,470
He means he wants to hire us both
at a wholesale rate.

2059
02:15:09,683 --> 02:15:11,266
2ab!

2060
02:15:11,387 --> 02:15:12,470
2ab!

2061
02:15:12,887 --> 02:15:15,012
a² + b² + 2ab

2062
02:15:17,304 --> 02:15:18,262
60 rupees, bro.

2063
02:15:19,220 --> 02:15:22,387
a+b+b+a=a+b+ab.

2064
02:15:22,470 --> 02:15:23,387
Uh-huh?

2065
02:15:23,845 --> 02:15:25,512
Twinkle twinkle little star.

2066
02:15:25,595 --> 02:15:27,262
Jack and Jill went up the hill.
So what, bro?

2067
02:15:27,371 --> 02:15:28,538
Give me my money.
- Hey.

2068
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:30,179
a+b=

2069
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:32,554
a² + b² + 2ab

2070
02:15:32,750 --> 02:15:34,580
Hmm... Got it, bro...
You can go.

2071
02:15:35,788 --> 02:15:40,038
If we had focused so much in school,
we wouldn’t be into these jobs.

2072
02:15:40,404 --> 02:15:43,238
Couldn’t you find someone else to bother?

2073
02:15:43,387 --> 02:15:44,137
Damn it!

2074
02:15:46,575 --> 02:15:48,158
These are your coaching results.

2075
02:15:51,158 --> 02:15:52,325
First on the list...

2076
02:15:53,700 --> 02:15:54,950
Kondamalli!

2077
02:15:57,684 --> 02:15:58,767
Balijayya!

2078
02:16:00,741 --> 02:16:02,116
Kanthayya!
- I’m here.

2079
02:16:02,533 --> 02:16:03,450
Kasi!

2080
02:16:03,671 --> 02:16:05,046
Suri! Gundappa!

2081
02:16:05,101 --> 02:16:06,351
Samba! KK!

2082
02:16:06,408 --> 02:16:07,783
Seshayya! Yadanna!

2083
02:16:07,893 --> 02:16:08,852
Somudu!

2084
02:16:09,866 --> 02:16:10,762
Yeah!

2085
02:16:11,908 --> 02:16:13,075
- Abhi...
- Sir?

2086
02:16:13,546 --> 02:16:18,546
We can never get them
to give an expression.

2087
02:16:19,116 --> 02:16:20,908
I don’t want them anywhere near
the shooting area.

2088
02:16:21,491 --> 02:16:23,450
They’re a bunch of wooden face morons.

2089
02:16:24,283 --> 02:16:25,491
Coming to Ganesh...

2090
02:16:25,991 --> 02:16:27,456
He’s ferocious.

2091
02:16:29,658 --> 02:16:32,283
He’s ready now...
You can start shooting.

2092
02:16:48,950 --> 02:16:50,158
Why are you wiping the scar?

2093
02:16:50,283 --> 02:16:51,658
Director asked me to cover it up.

2094
02:16:58,366 --> 02:16:59,408
It’s Ganesh bro.

2095
02:17:00,783 --> 02:17:02,491
It’s his debut.

2096
02:17:02,991 --> 02:17:04,241
He’ll have all kinds of silly demands.

2097
02:17:04,309 --> 02:17:06,934
We  won’t comply...
We’ve seen many debutants in my time.

2098
02:17:07,033 --> 02:17:08,408
I know, right? Well said.

2099
02:17:08,491 --> 02:17:09,533
Uncle, come here.

2100
02:17:09,825 --> 02:17:11,116
- Me?
- Come!

2101
02:17:12,033 --> 02:17:13,783
Uncle, I want you to direct the first shot.

2102
02:17:14,116 --> 02:17:15,450
- Me?
- Yes, uncle.

2103
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:17,241
Say ‘Action’ and bless me.

2104
02:17:19,158 --> 02:17:20,033
Hold it, uncle.

2105
02:17:31,116 --> 02:17:32,325
On lights!

2106
02:17:38,241 --> 02:17:39,450
Clap in!

2107
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:44,575
Start sound!

2108
02:17:47,533 --> 02:17:49,450
Roll camera!

2109
02:17:52,741 --> 02:17:54,908
SK Productions...
Production no. 9...

2110
02:17:55,075 --> 02:17:57,200
Opening shot...
All the best to all of us.

2111
02:17:57,450 --> 02:17:58,408
Thank you.

2112
02:17:59,283 --> 02:18:01,075
Action!

2113
02:18:06,491 --> 02:18:08,825
Ganesh! Gaddalakonda Ganesh!

2114
02:18:09,491 --> 02:18:10,283
What do you think?

2115
02:18:10,366 --> 02:18:11,533
Cut!

2116
02:18:27,450 --> 02:18:28,408
Uncle...

2117
02:18:31,116 --> 02:18:32,075
This is enough.

2118
02:18:32,908 --> 02:18:34,700
This is enough for my lifetime.

2119
02:18:44,991 --> 02:18:47,033
He’s a debut director.
He’s showing off.

2120
02:18:47,325 --> 02:18:48,991
Nothing I’ve never seen before.

2121
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:50,283
Welcome, writer sir.

2122
02:18:50,866 --> 02:18:52,658
It’s a really nice character.
I want you to do well.

2123
02:18:52,950 --> 02:18:55,616
You’ve turned a writer into an actor.

2124
02:18:55,658 --> 02:18:56,908
You should bring the best out of me.

2125
02:18:59,283 --> 02:19:00,200
Who’s that?

2126
02:19:00,783 --> 02:19:01,741
Bombay villain, sir.

2127
02:19:01,825 --> 02:19:02,991
He’s memorizing his lines.

2128
02:19:03,575 --> 02:19:05,491
Bombay villains have no lines to say...

2129
02:19:05,741 --> 02:19:08,033
Except for ‘Who is he?
Where is he from?’

2130
02:19:08,158 --> 02:19:09,408
‘Kill him, guys!’

2131
02:19:10,366 --> 02:19:12,116
- Am I right?
- Who is he?

2132
02:19:12,241 --> 02:19:13,325
Kill him, guys!

2133
02:19:14,783 --> 02:19:16,533
Didn’t I tell you? So obvious!

2134
02:19:16,741 --> 02:19:18,116
You’re talking to a writer.

2135
02:19:18,825 --> 02:19:20,658
Sir, the next shot is yours.

2136
02:19:20,908 --> 02:19:22,450
Go get ready.
- Okay. Okay.

2137
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:23,616
Okay.

2138
02:19:23,741 --> 02:19:25,616
Ma’am, your shot is ready.

2139
02:19:26,616 --> 02:19:28,116
I’m not ready yet. Wait for me.

2140
02:19:43,116 --> 02:19:45,246
Valmiki was an ordinary man...

2141
02:19:45,712 --> 02:19:50,474
He transitioned into a sage and
penned the Ramayan...

2142
02:19:51,741 --> 02:19:54,283
So I want our film's title to be 'Valmiki'.

2143
02:19:55,571 --> 02:19:58,655
You should name orphanages
and schools after sages.

2144
02:19:59,024 --> 02:20:00,066
Not films.

2145
02:20:00,325 --> 02:20:01,283
Guys!

2146
02:20:01,741 --> 02:20:05,616
I’ll throw a huge party for whoever
comes up with a nice title.

2147
02:20:05,741 --> 02:20:06,491
I have an idea, bro.

2148
02:20:06,575 --> 02:20:08,700
‘De Thadi Pochamma Gudi’ (Catchy Telugu Phrase)
What do you think?

2149
02:20:09,866 --> 02:20:10,491
Idiot!

2150
02:20:10,575 --> 02:20:12,866
Kanthayya, no phrases for us.

2151
02:20:12,950 --> 02:20:14,450
Think of something else.
- ‘Ganesh!’

2152
02:20:14,658 --> 02:20:16,075
‘Gaddalakonda Ganesh!’

2153
02:20:16,491 --> 02:20:17,866
There’s already a movie called ‘Ganesh’.

2154
02:20:18,908 --> 02:20:20,158
How does ‘Seetimaar’ (blow a whistle) sound?

2155
02:20:20,825 --> 02:20:23,866
When Ganesh bro is on screen,
everyone would blow a whistle.

2156
02:20:25,544 --> 02:20:26,619
Fantastic!

2157
02:20:27,450 --> 02:20:28,575
It sounds fantastic…

2158
02:20:28,783 --> 02:20:31,116
Hey, director! That’s our title. Finalize it.

2159
02:20:31,408 --> 02:20:32,325
‘Seetimaar!’

2160
02:20:33,741 --> 02:20:34,783
Seetimaar?

2161
02:20:34,991 --> 02:20:38,075
If he put the title 'Valmiki',
youth will know his greatness..

2162
02:20:38,533 --> 02:20:42,325
Director, the current generation should
know the greatness of Ganesh.

2163
02:20:42,658 --> 02:20:44,950
Bro, I’d go with ‘Seetimaar’ any day.

2164
02:20:45,908 --> 02:20:47,075
‘Seetimaar!’

2165
02:20:48,450 --> 02:20:49,658
‘Seetimaar!’

2166
02:20:58,783 --> 02:20:59,575
Abhi...

2167
02:21:01,991 --> 02:21:04,408
Is it so hard to make a movie?

2168
02:21:04,783 --> 02:21:05,741
Sorry, Abhi.

2169
02:21:05,866 --> 02:21:08,200
I didn’t know you have
to go through so much.

2170
02:21:08,283 --> 02:21:10,075
Thanks for understanding.

2171
02:21:10,491 --> 02:21:14,908
I hope you understand my feelings too.

2172
02:21:15,408 --> 02:21:18,033
I’m here because I know your heart.

2173
02:21:25,033 --> 02:21:26,241
Don’t you get it?

2174
02:21:26,658 --> 02:21:28,450
Can’t you give a romantic look?
- Take 1!

2175
02:21:29,158 --> 02:21:30,169
Will you come?

2176
02:21:30,366 --> 02:21:31,991
- Feel the love, man.
- Take 9!

2177
02:21:32,491 --> 02:21:34,408
I didn’t expect you’d come.
How’d you manage to, now?

2178
02:21:34,491 --> 02:21:36,116
I want romance!

2179
02:21:36,575 --> 02:21:39,259
I’ll be there if you show up.
Director sir, this is final.

2180
02:21:39,825 --> 02:21:41,741
- Take 21!
- I want love!

2181
02:21:42,241 --> 02:21:44,366
- Take 45!
- Feel from inside.

2182
02:21:44,450 --> 02:21:45,533
Take 50!

2183
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:47,616
50th take.

2184
02:21:50,456 --> 02:21:51,793
When you see a girl in front of you...

2185
02:21:51,908 --> 02:21:53,593
You must be feeling Ilayaraja’s music
in the backdrop.

2186
02:21:53,783 --> 02:21:55,075
I’m a Rajkoti’s fan.

2187
02:21:55,408 --> 02:21:56,158
Huh?

2188
02:21:56,616 --> 02:21:58,450
- Rajkoti!
- Whatever!

2189
02:21:58,533 --> 02:21:59,325
You must be feeling a little romantic.

2190
02:21:59,450 --> 02:22:01,783
I hate you and your beard! Holy shit!

2191
02:22:03,445 --> 02:22:04,820
Can’t you express love?

2192
02:22:05,991 --> 02:22:07,825
Can we do one last shot?

2193
02:22:08,075 --> 02:22:09,282
How many takes are you going to take?

2194
02:22:09,491 --> 02:22:10,624
Clock’s ticking away.

2195
02:22:10,825 --> 02:22:12,908
It’s a back shot anyway.
Use a body double.

2196
02:22:13,075 --> 02:22:14,283
I’ll send the costume.

2197
02:22:28,283 --> 02:22:28,991
Gani...

2198
02:22:29,850 --> 02:22:31,487
Imagine the Devi you are in love with...

2199
02:22:31,950 --> 02:22:33,366
She is here for you..

2200
02:22:33,575 --> 02:22:34,964
Standing in front of you...

2201
02:22:35,218 --> 02:22:38,699
She came here only for you.

2202
02:22:39,991 --> 02:22:42,200
Imagine her as Devi...

2203
02:22:44,658 --> 02:22:47,908
For once... Think of Devi's memories...

2204
02:23:07,033 --> 02:23:07,908
Devi!

2205
02:23:14,325 --> 02:23:15,158
Devi!

2206
02:23:17,075 --> 02:23:17,991
I’m here.

2207
02:23:19,408 --> 02:23:22,200
I left everything behind
just to be here with you.

2208
02:23:24,158 --> 02:23:27,325
I can’t even imagine my life without you.

2209
02:23:28,366 --> 02:23:30,908
I’d lose anything behind for you...

2210
02:23:31,575 --> 02:23:32,783
I’ll never let you go.

2211
02:23:33,991 --> 02:23:35,438
I’ll hold on to you until my last breath.

2212
02:23:37,991 --> 02:23:39,616
Don't leave me, Devi...

2213
02:23:40,491 --> 02:23:41,908
Never leave me again.

2214
02:23:51,950 --> 02:23:52,741
Cut it!

2215
02:23:53,116 --> 02:23:55,033
- Superb!
- Fantastic!

2216
02:23:55,741 --> 02:23:57,283
This is your career’s best shot.

2217
02:24:02,658 --> 02:24:05,075
You did exactly like I told you.
Congrats!

2218
02:24:05,450 --> 02:24:06,366
Thank you!

2219
02:24:14,691 --> 02:24:16,358
They might be cheering you now...

2220
02:24:16,866 --> 02:24:19,200
But I was the first one to see
a hero in you.

2221
02:24:19,450 --> 02:24:20,950
Amazing acting!

2222
02:24:21,366 --> 02:24:23,241
If I were in Devi’s place...

2223
02:24:23,408 --> 02:24:26,241
I’d talk to Abhilash,
change the story and marry you.

2224
02:24:29,783 --> 02:24:31,241
We can’t change a few stories.

2225
02:24:32,908 --> 02:24:36,033
True love has the power to change anyone.

2226
02:24:57,649 --> 02:25:00,983
You can never keep still, can you?

2227
02:25:01,783 --> 02:25:02,741
Hey, Bujjamma!

2228
02:25:04,158 --> 02:25:05,283
You! Come here.

2229
02:25:05,533 --> 02:25:06,783
He’s calling you. Go!

2230
02:25:09,158 --> 02:25:10,491
I got hurt... Feed me.

2231
02:25:10,908 --> 02:25:11,908
- Huh?!
- Feed me!

2232
02:25:23,178 --> 02:25:26,136
'True love has the power to change anyone.'

2233
02:25:34,783 --> 02:25:35,616
Oh no!

2234
02:25:35,929 --> 02:25:36,929
Water.

2235
02:25:44,033 --> 02:25:46,533
There might be men guarding you
at all times...

2236
02:25:46,752 --> 02:25:51,252
But you need someone by your side
to look after you, Ganesh.

2237
02:25:51,810 --> 02:25:53,768
Be it any Kingdom...

2238
02:25:54,086 --> 02:25:56,044
If the Queen isn’t by the throne...

2239
02:25:56,421 --> 02:25:57,864
The King will have no glory.

2240
02:25:58,408 --> 02:25:59,408
Hmm.

2241
02:26:12,241 --> 02:26:13,866
You must have watched Godfather long back.

2242
02:26:13,950 --> 02:26:15,450
Seetimaar will rewrite history tomorrow.

2243
02:26:15,552 --> 02:26:17,677
My photography will speak volumes of it.

2244
02:26:17,908 --> 02:26:18,866
Lucky team!

2245
02:26:19,033 --> 02:26:23,908
We haven’t compromised a bit
on the production.

2246
02:26:24,798 --> 02:26:26,256
Hello, everyone.

2247
02:26:26,491 --> 02:26:27,545
How are you doing?

2248
02:26:28,316 --> 02:26:31,108
I’m so sorry.
I’m still learning Telugu.

2249
02:26:31,408 --> 02:26:32,450
Thank you.

2250
02:26:33,366 --> 02:26:35,450
You’re a Telugu girl, right?
Why’d you pretend to be from the North?

2251
02:26:35,511 --> 02:26:37,386
Isn’t that why you value us?

2252
02:26:37,616 --> 02:26:38,658
Whoa!

2253
02:26:38,740 --> 02:26:40,481
I’ve trained many heroes...

2254
02:26:42,322 --> 02:26:43,780
But this training...

2255
02:26:45,379 --> 02:26:47,546
I can’t forget it in my lifetime.

2256
02:26:49,325 --> 02:26:51,950
I’ll cherish it forever.

2257
02:26:52,075 --> 02:26:53,366
They said I’d be the side hero.

2258
02:26:53,859 --> 02:26:54,866
But I was sidelined...

2259
02:26:55,033 --> 02:26:56,450
I might have failed as an artist...

2260
02:26:56,658 --> 02:26:58,241
But I’m proud to be Abhilash’s friend.

2261
02:26:58,491 --> 02:26:59,793
All the best to the entire team.

2262
02:27:01,866 --> 02:27:03,158
Hello, everyone.

2263
02:27:03,241 --> 02:27:04,866
I don’t want to say anything
about the film.

2264
02:27:05,241 --> 02:27:06,450
Just watch it.

2265
02:27:10,158 --> 02:27:11,741
Gani, you must rock!

2266
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:14,116
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

2267
02:27:14,491 --> 02:27:16,075
Gaddalakonda Ganesh here.

2268
02:27:17,408 --> 02:27:18,825
It’s Gaddalakonda Ganesh!

2269
02:27:19,450 --> 02:27:20,783
Gaddalakonda Ganesh!

2270
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:26,783
Ganesh bro...

2271
02:27:26,975 --> 02:27:30,725
My director Abhilash made me a hero.

2272
02:27:34,075 --> 02:27:37,950
But Bujjamma was the first to see
a hero in me.

2273
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:42,659
- You’re so jealous!
- Get lost!

2274
02:27:42,741 --> 02:27:43,759
Hold on...

2275
02:27:44,741 --> 02:27:47,033
I don’t know how I can ever repay them.

2276
02:27:47,443 --> 02:27:50,901
So I’m going to gift a house
to Abhi in our village.

2277
02:27:53,866 --> 02:27:54,825
Seriously?

2278
02:27:54,991 --> 02:27:58,950
And I’m going to marry Bujjamma
and take her home.

2279
02:28:00,991 --> 02:28:02,325
Yay!

2280
02:28:03,241 --> 02:28:05,283
Gani, you’re a sweetheart.

2281
02:28:05,371 --> 02:28:06,662
Hey, old woman... Are you happy?

2282
02:28:06,761 --> 02:28:08,428
He agreed to the wedding, Bujji.

2283
02:28:10,616 --> 02:28:13,950
I always predicted this.
You’re my sweetheart.

2284
02:28:14,605 --> 02:28:16,644
We’ll get married soon
after the movie releases.

2285
02:28:16,950 --> 02:28:18,158
I’ll be hosting a party
at the same venue.

2286
02:28:20,658 --> 02:28:21,950
My dear...

2287
02:28:22,325 --> 02:28:24,075
Why do you look so upset?

2288
02:28:32,135 --> 02:28:33,635
You heard Ganesh, right?

2289
02:28:33,950 --> 02:28:36,447
I have nothing more to say...

2290
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:38,741
If you don’t marry me..

2291
02:28:39,408 --> 02:28:43,158
I’ll end up dead before
your debut film releases.

2292
02:28:44,261 --> 02:28:45,261
Bujjamma!

2293
02:28:46,325 --> 02:28:47,325
Bujjamma!

2294
02:28:55,491 --> 02:28:58,366
The movie Ganesh bro acted in...
Seetimaar!

2295
02:28:58,496 --> 02:29:00,412
I’m sending 4 tickets each...

2296
02:29:00,684 --> 02:29:02,601
Beers and biryani will be served.
Get going.

2297
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:05,825
We’ll break your bones
if you miss the movie.

2298
02:29:06,783 --> 02:29:09,575
Hey! The whole world is waiting
for Avengers.

2299
02:29:09,866 --> 02:29:11,366
A Hollywood film is about
to hit the screens.

2300
02:29:11,450 --> 02:29:14,116
How can you expect us to
screen some debutant’s film?

2301
02:29:24,007 --> 02:29:26,991
Collect the tickets.
I want you to watch all 4 shows.

2302
02:29:27,075 --> 02:29:27,700
Hurry up.

2303
02:29:27,741 --> 02:29:29,658
Everyone must watch all 4 shows.

2304
02:29:33,700 --> 02:29:35,533
Seetimaar! Seetimaar!

2305
02:29:35,575 --> 02:29:37,533
This title has been ringing in our ears.

2306
02:29:37,616 --> 02:29:41,241
This movie introduces famous gangster
Ganesh as the hero.

2307
02:29:42,450 --> 02:29:45,033
And let’s say... Ganesh! Ganesh! Ganesh!

2308
02:29:45,158 --> 02:29:46,783
A superstar has arrived.

2309
02:29:46,950 --> 02:29:50,200
Today we’re seeing the theatres filled
with his mesmerizing fans.

2310
02:29:50,283 --> 02:29:53,908
Coming to the collections,
it’s breaking records.

2311
02:30:12,108 --> 02:30:14,320
Go inside...
I'll bring my parents and Bujjamma.

2312
02:31:04,151 --> 02:31:06,776
The movie is mind-blowing!
You stole the show.

2313
02:31:11,544 --> 02:31:13,878
Bro, Abhi is running away with Bujjamma.

2314
02:31:15,728 --> 02:31:17,728
I saw them going away in car.

2315
02:31:42,412 --> 02:31:45,239
I fell in love with Devi a while ago...

2316
02:31:46,506 --> 02:31:48,579
I was fooled and betrayed.

2317
02:31:50,478 --> 02:31:52,728
I had feelings for a girl again
after so long...

2318
02:31:54,455 --> 02:31:56,538
A fool betrayed me.

2319
02:31:57,997 --> 02:31:59,455
I was a loser back then.

2320
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:01,354
But now... I’m Ganesh.

2321
02:32:01,457 --> 02:32:02,887
Gaddalakonda Ganesh!

2322
02:32:05,311 --> 02:32:11,004
Guys! Search everywhere
and get him to me. Go!

2323
02:32:11,205 --> 02:32:12,585
I’ll kill Abhilash.

2324
02:32:12,805 --> 02:32:14,180
I was a hero only for the film’s sake.

2325
02:32:14,338 --> 02:32:16,421
I’ll remind everyone
I’m a villain in reality.

2326
02:32:16,638 --> 02:32:18,763
Ganesh, please calm down.

2327
02:32:18,827 --> 02:32:19,702
Hey!

2328
02:32:21,122 --> 02:32:22,247
Hey...

2329
02:32:23,331 --> 02:32:24,373
Old woman!

2330
02:32:24,905 --> 02:32:27,696
You should’ve controlled her
instead of me.

2331
02:32:28,574 --> 02:32:29,714
What is this, Gani?

2332
02:32:29,775 --> 02:32:31,775
You’ve never raised your hand on a woman
in all these years.

2333
02:32:31,879 --> 02:32:34,475
Because a woman has never raised her voice
in front of me in all these years.

2334
02:32:36,834 --> 02:32:40,173
Just because I have make up on,
everyone thinks I’m a clown.

2335
02:32:40,746 --> 02:32:42,246
They don’t have the same fear anymore.

2336
02:32:42,438 --> 02:32:43,438
I’ll show them.

2337
02:32:43,730 --> 02:32:44,850
I’ll show them what I am.

2338
02:32:45,023 --> 02:32:46,874
I’ll make sure they fear me again.

2339
02:32:48,055 --> 02:32:50,472
Once you witness Abhi’s death...

2340
02:32:51,063 --> 02:32:55,007
The name Gaddalakonda Ganesh
must send shivers down your spine.

2341
02:32:55,877 --> 02:32:57,750
Call Vamsi and get the MLA on line.

2342
02:32:57,855 --> 02:32:59,105
MLA passed away, bro.

2343
02:32:59,313 --> 02:33:01,079
I didn’t want to upset you during
the release.

2344
02:33:09,776 --> 02:33:11,781
I can’t believe this happened to you...

2345
02:33:11,889 --> 02:33:14,305
Brother has left us.

2346
02:33:21,567 --> 02:33:22,546
Tea.

2347
02:33:23,394 --> 02:33:26,352
Get me a ginger tea.
My throat is sore from all the crying.

2348
02:33:26,468 --> 02:33:27,568
Okay madam.

2349
02:33:29,455 --> 02:33:31,663
I can’t believe this happened to you...

2350
02:33:49,112 --> 02:33:51,196
He’s the hero in the film ‘Seetimaar’.

2351
02:33:51,268 --> 02:33:53,000
Oh, really? He looks handsome.

2352
02:34:01,313 --> 02:34:05,147
Brother, you’re the hero
in the film ‘Seetimaar’, right?

2353
02:34:05,438 --> 02:34:07,605
Yes, he’s the hero in the film.

2354
02:34:07,772 --> 02:34:09,355
What a film!

2355
02:34:09,480 --> 02:34:12,438
Your performance and action
were just amazing.

2356
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:14,896
It was rocking. You killed it!

2357
02:34:16,569 --> 02:34:19,569
We’ll watch the movie over and over again.

2358
02:34:22,396 --> 02:34:24,934
I can’t believe this happened to you.

2359
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:27,711
Hey! Make sure the funeral is grand.

2360
02:34:28,321 --> 02:34:30,274
Your father has a lot of followers
in the area.

2361
02:34:30,913 --> 02:34:32,205
I don’t want any compromises.

2362
02:34:32,600 --> 02:34:34,066
Let me know if you need anything.

2363
02:34:34,980 --> 02:34:36,177
Don’t talk about the followers, bro.

2364
02:34:36,298 --> 02:34:38,006
They surrounded him when he was alive.

2365
02:34:38,423 --> 02:34:40,298
And now that he’s dead, no one showed up.

2366
02:34:41,230 --> 02:34:43,301
They don’t admire him, bro.

2367
02:34:43,730 --> 02:34:44,772
They just fear him.

2368
02:34:45,063 --> 02:34:47,147
When they fear our existence...

2369
02:34:47,355 --> 02:34:50,213
They’d obviously wish for our death,
not wellness.

2370
02:34:55,873 --> 02:34:58,186
That is why I hate these
gangs and politics.

2371
02:35:04,066 --> 02:35:06,274
When they fear our existence..

2372
02:35:06,372 --> 02:35:08,956
They’d obviously wish for our death,
not wellness.

2373
02:35:11,276 --> 02:35:12,622
Brother, one selfie.

2374
02:35:13,366 --> 02:35:14,633
There he is.

2375
02:35:23,008 --> 02:35:24,716
He's calling again... Talk to him.

2376
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:26,147
Tell me.

2377
02:35:26,386 --> 02:35:28,845
Bro, I’ve watched your film three times.
Three times!

2378
02:35:29,062 --> 02:35:31,784
Watch it 30 times if you want.
Why the heck are you telling me?

2379
02:35:35,471 --> 02:35:36,705
Bro, it’s the SP.

2380
02:35:37,448 --> 02:35:40,168
How’d you do it, brother?

2381
02:35:40,319 --> 02:35:43,948
What do you mean how? I just
followed the Director’s instructions.

2382
02:35:47,506 --> 02:35:49,298
Uncle is that beard original?

2383
02:35:49,438 --> 02:35:51,188
Come. Come pull it. Come on.

2384
02:35:51,711 --> 02:35:54,149
Guys, I don’t want to answer
any more calls.

2385
02:35:54,397 --> 02:35:55,480
Hang up!

2386
02:36:09,946 --> 02:36:10,757
Gani,

2387
02:36:10,932 --> 02:36:12,921
Abhi is going to Tirupati
to marry Bujjamma.

2388
02:36:28,272 --> 02:36:29,335
Ganesh bro...

2389
02:36:33,863 --> 02:36:35,777
Hey! Go back. Go back.

2390
02:36:35,961 --> 02:36:36,801
Go!

2391
02:37:12,119 --> 02:37:15,411
How dare you elope with a girl
I was going to marry?

2392
02:37:16,618 --> 02:37:17,770
I won't spare you.

2393
02:37:17,952 --> 02:37:19,270
Let’s get some clarity, Gani.

2394
02:37:20,145 --> 02:37:22,520
I didn’t elope with the girl
you were going to marry.

2395
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:26,063
You were going to marry the girl
that loved me.

2396
02:37:26,412 --> 02:37:28,374
I know Bujjamma long before you do.

2397
02:37:28,594 --> 02:37:30,277
But I know what’s in her heart.

2398
02:37:30,799 --> 02:37:34,340
You want Bujjamma only out of ego.

2399
02:37:34,720 --> 02:37:37,303
You said such things and made me go mad.

2400
02:37:37,421 --> 02:37:38,629
I made you a hero.

2401
02:37:39,281 --> 02:37:40,684
A hero!

2402
02:37:43,298 --> 02:37:46,465
People who resented you
are now cheering for you.

2403
02:37:46,751 --> 02:37:50,741
People who were disgusted by you are
now clicking pictures with you.

2404
02:37:52,079 --> 02:37:53,412
Film is so powerful

2405
02:37:54,563 --> 02:37:56,147
it changes your life.

2406
02:37:56,982 --> 02:37:59,021
Your ego, hatred and anger...

2407
02:38:00,555 --> 02:38:02,139
Don’t stand a chance.

2408
02:38:02,348 --> 02:38:03,765
But film prevails.

2409
02:38:04,272 --> 02:38:05,730
Film gave you a life.

2410
02:38:06,060 --> 02:38:08,167
If you fool me once, you’re smart.

2411
02:38:08,418 --> 02:38:10,210
But if you fool me twice,
it means I’m a fool.

2412
02:38:10,605 --> 02:38:12,677
What are you guys still looking at?
Kill him!

2413
02:38:20,813 --> 02:38:22,133
Abhi.

2414
02:38:55,355 --> 02:38:56,438
Ganesh bro...

2415
02:38:59,165 --> 02:39:00,081
Who is she?

2416
02:39:00,322 --> 02:39:01,489
Raju’s wife.

2417
02:39:04,980 --> 02:39:05,984
Brother...

2418
02:39:06,067 --> 02:39:07,858
My daughter wanted to see you.

2419
02:39:08,980 --> 02:39:10,901
I haven’t stepped out
since Raju’s passed away.

2420
02:39:11,041 --> 02:39:15,250
When your movie released,
your men made sure we get to watch it.

2421
02:39:15,855 --> 02:39:19,517
Me and my daughter had a lot of fun
after a really long time.

2422
02:39:21,035 --> 02:39:23,744
She recognized you from a distance
and wanted to see you.

2423
02:39:24,220 --> 02:39:26,262
It was Ganesh uncle in the movie. Look.

2424
02:39:29,331 --> 02:39:30,377
I'll see you later.

2425
02:39:34,439 --> 02:39:36,731
- Doesn’t she know?
- No, bro.

2426
02:39:37,693 --> 02:39:42,424
Everyone thinks Prabhakar killed ‘Bullet’ Raja
and you killed Prabhakar.

2427
02:39:46,962 --> 02:39:47,987
Brother...

2428
02:39:49,897 --> 02:39:51,855
My daughter had something to say to you.

2429
02:39:51,980 --> 02:39:53,230
What is it, dear? Tell him.

2430
02:39:53,355 --> 02:39:54,605
What is it? Go ahead.

2431
02:40:01,568 --> 02:40:04,318
You look really good in the movie, uncle.

2432
02:40:34,979 --> 02:40:37,445
Hey... Stop!
Go back...

2433
02:41:23,688 --> 02:41:24,730
Ganesh...

2434
02:41:44,420 --> 02:41:46,670
You look so good in the film.

2435
02:41:49,989 --> 02:41:55,563
You looked magnificent
on the silver screen.

2436
02:41:57,855 --> 02:42:00,659
I couldn’t take my eyes off you.

2437
02:42:02,585 --> 02:42:05,835
People were raving about you.

2438
02:42:11,397 --> 02:42:15,772
I stepped out, as I didn’t want
to cause bad omen.

2439
02:42:18,647 --> 02:42:24,605
I always want you to do something
people appreciate you for.

2440
02:42:27,294 --> 02:42:31,501
Don't do something
where people will cuss you..

2441
02:42:35,543 --> 02:42:41,877
Hope you live a long and prosperous life.

2442
02:43:07,556 --> 02:43:08,501
Mother...

2443
02:43:09,705 --> 02:43:12,871
I lied in court because
I’d be sentenced otherwise.

2444
02:43:14,069 --> 02:43:16,355
But I never expected
you’d stop talking

2445
02:43:16,483 --> 02:43:18,849
and punish me so many years.

2446
02:43:21,731 --> 02:43:24,558
How could you be without talking to me
for so many years.

2447
02:43:27,529 --> 02:43:28,987
My son...!

2448
02:44:46,053 --> 02:44:48,582
You made a mistake by running away
with Bujjamma.

2449
02:44:49,669 --> 02:44:51,735
I felt it right to kill you.

2450
02:44:52,734 --> 02:44:54,609
You ruined my image in Gaddalakonda.

2451
02:44:54,867 --> 02:44:56,992
I felt no wrong in killing you.

2452
02:45:01,714 --> 02:45:02,589
But...

2453
02:45:06,157 --> 02:45:07,094
But...

2454
02:45:08,261 --> 02:45:10,121
My mother never spoke to me all these years...

2455
02:45:11,094 --> 02:45:13,118
But today she spoke to me…

2456
02:45:15,501 --> 02:45:16,930
I killed Bullet Raja...

2457
02:45:18,569 --> 02:45:20,902
But his daughter give me a kiss.

2458
02:45:23,291 --> 02:45:24,832
Now I wonder…

2459
02:45:26,926 --> 02:45:28,196
if it’s right to kill you.

2460
02:45:33,281 --> 02:45:35,615
I heard film brings you money

2461
02:45:36,656 --> 02:45:37,947
I heard film brings fame…

2462
02:45:38,754 --> 02:45:42,587
But I’ve never heard it gives
so much love.

2463
02:45:46,313 --> 02:45:48,355
You showered me with all this love.

2464
02:45:49,584 --> 02:45:52,065
Its feels like I should
give your love back.

2465
02:46:01,108 --> 02:46:02,808
You didn’t come here to tell my story...

2466
02:46:03,934 --> 02:46:05,415
You’re here to change it.

2467
02:46:24,395 --> 02:46:25,812
Take good care of Bujjamma.

2468
02:46:26,883 --> 02:46:28,716
If you hurt her by any chance...

2469
02:46:29,422 --> 02:46:33,485
(a+b)²=  a² + b² + 2ab

2470
02:46:50,026 --> 02:46:51,151
Director sir…

2471
02:46:52,855 --> 02:46:54,355
Do you have Rajamouli’s number?

2472
02:46:57,721 --> 02:46:58,870
I’ll text you.

2473
02:47:02,397 --> 02:47:03,313
Let’s go.

2474
02:47:13,842 --> 02:47:15,425
Got you finally!

2475
02:47:16,866 --> 02:47:18,033
Any last wish?

2476
02:47:18,150 --> 02:47:21,150
Forget about my wishes...
I’ll fulfill your last wish.

2477
02:47:21,885 --> 02:47:23,593
Gaddalakonda is yours now.

2478
02:47:24,105 --> 02:47:24,980
Take it.

2479
02:47:26,355 --> 02:47:27,897
I don't have that courage...

2480
02:47:29,188 --> 02:47:30,980
I can’t put my life at stake.

2481
02:47:31,644 --> 02:47:33,644
I watched your movie recently...

2482
02:47:34,253 --> 02:47:35,337
You were great in it.

2483
02:47:36,010 --> 02:47:38,219
I want you to help me out now...

2484
02:47:38,980 --> 02:47:39,772
Me?

2485
02:47:54,980 --> 02:47:56,438
Cut it. Take okay.

2486
02:47:57,663 --> 02:47:58,572
Wow!

2487
02:47:58,772 --> 02:48:00,759
You did great in your debut film.

2488
02:48:00,938 --> 02:48:01,813
Ganesh…

2489
02:48:02,147 --> 02:48:03,438
Ganesh, you have to change costume
for the next scene.

2490
02:48:03,498 --> 02:48:04,465
Okay.

2491
02:48:04,820 --> 02:48:06,314
You're a Villain. Stop laughing.

2492
02:48:09,694 --> 02:48:10,636
What did I tell you?

2493
02:48:10,769 --> 02:48:12,727
Hold the gun at exactly 45 degrees.

2494
02:48:12,976 --> 02:48:14,851
You are holding at 43 or 47 degrees.

2495
02:48:15,605 --> 02:48:16,813
If you hold it at 45,

2496
02:48:16,980 --> 02:48:18,397
bullet shoots straight into the stomach.

2497
02:48:20,048 --> 02:48:20,839
No...

2498
02:48:22,068 --> 02:48:23,759
I don’t think that’s right...
Let’s do something.

2499
02:48:23,982 --> 02:48:25,854
Hold it at 49 to 49.5 degrees.

2500
02:48:26,409 --> 02:48:27,750
Bullet will directly hit the heart.

2501
02:48:28,442 --> 02:48:29,580
- Okay?
- Done.

2502
02:48:30,063 --> 02:48:31,136
Let’s shoot.

2503
02:48:31,471 --> 02:48:33,207
- Whatever you say.
- You got it, right?

2504
02:48:33,730 --> 02:48:34,855
49.3 degrees.

2505
02:48:36,855 --> 02:48:37,994
Start camera!

2506
02:48:39,594 --> 02:48:40,480
Action!

2507
02:48:41,063 --> 02:48:43,226
This is Gaddalakonda Ganesh’s
criminal record...

2508
02:48:43,352 --> 02:48:45,519
Audio and videotapes with his confessions.

2509
02:48:48,813 --> 02:48:49,868
Thank you.

2510
02:48:50,605 --> 02:48:53,101
I’ve been waiting for really long...
Thank you very much.

2511
02:48:58,438 --> 02:48:59,475
Devi!

2512
02:49:00,693 --> 02:49:01,901
Turn the geyser on.

2513
02:49:25,173 --> 02:49:26,006
Hey!

2514
02:49:27,027 --> 02:49:30,485
You promised you wouldn’t
think of Ganesh ever again.

2515
02:49:31,813 --> 02:49:34,063
You promised you wouldn’t mess with
Ganesh’s ever again...

2516
02:49:36,803 --> 02:49:38,723
She destroyed the evidence.

2517
02:49:39,647 --> 02:49:40,863
- Hello...
- Hello...

2518
02:49:41,147 --> 02:49:42,313
May I speak to Ganesh?

2519
02:49:42,531 --> 02:49:44,565
Sir is in between shot... Who are you?

2520
02:49:45,831 --> 02:49:47,446
Tell him it’s Sridevi.

2521
02:49:50,323 --> 02:49:52,187
No dates boss.

2522
02:49:53,112 --> 02:49:55,627
We are shooting a sequel movie...

2523
02:49:58,035 --> 02:49:58,826
Not possible.

2524
02:50:16,124 --> 02:50:18,706
I'm not asking if you will act
in my film...

2525
02:50:21,113 --> 02:50:23,718
I'm saying... You’re doing it!

2526
02:50:35,055 --> 02:50:37,184
I was just kidding...
Don’t you get it?

2527
02:50:37,441 --> 02:50:39,848
I watched your movie ‘Seetimaar’.
It was great!

2528
02:50:39,938 --> 02:50:41,647
I want our movie to be a bigger hit.

2529
02:50:42,958 --> 02:50:44,333
By the way, who are they?

2530
02:50:44,423 --> 02:50:45,631
Cute boys!

2531
02:50:45,773 --> 02:50:47,148
Cast them in our film.

2532
02:50:47,386 --> 02:50:50,030
Okay, guys? Let's keep in touch...

2533
02:50:51,758 --> 02:50:52,791
See you soon.

2534
02:50:57,772 --> 02:50:59,623
There are no standards anymore...

2535
02:51:01,039 --> 02:51:03,246
Sometimes I feel the art of cinema is dying.

2536
02:51:03,651 --> 02:51:05,493
I will inform powerstar about this issue.

2537
02:51:05,713 --> 02:51:07,580
He will see their end.
