'This is where it all began'

00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:10,043
'It was here, where my life
which was pointless until then,

4
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,947
was completely transform ed'

5
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,057
'I came here from Thrisshur'

00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,763
'There are many who
roam around here,

7
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,357
without any idea on what
to do with their lives'

8
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,361
'That's a blissful feeling'

00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,593

Strike on!
Strike on!

13
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,698
March forward, KSQ!

Catch him!

18
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,767
Stop there!

19
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,935
'It is a rootless tree'

'It's such a small world'

22
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,275
Bro, are there any
rooms available?

23
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,753
AC or non-AC?

24
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,414
A room with a fan
would be fine, bro!

25
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,382
Bro, I've done 50 rounds!

26
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,462
'Or breathless gasps?'

27
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:29,954
'Did you see the flag poles
& the areas in the shade?'

28
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:34,165
'Did you see the plain
lands <i>&</i> the sunny fields?'

29
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,964
Each and every girl is a promise!

30
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:40,943
I swear!

31
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,810
We will decide if we should wear a 'mundu'
(loincloth) in this campus or not!

32
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,144
If anyone tries to stop us, we
should retaliate instantly!

33
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,389
'Those who flew far away,
flapping their wings'

00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,181

'Those who weaved flower
carpets with their smiles'

36
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,959
'Those who burned like fire'

37
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,033
'Those who burned with wisdom'

38
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,797
'Those who shed their blood
and went into oblivion'

39
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,098
We can't tolerate KSQ's
goondaism anymore!

40
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,240
Even if it's one seat for SFY,

41
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,901
we will attain it even if
we have to shed blood here!

42
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,534
- Got it?
- Dude, run! Roopesh is here!

43
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,310
You really want to
shed blood, Subhash?

44
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,477
- Why aren't you going to class?
- I don't go to class!

45
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,008
I am the Principal!

46
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,352
So? Should I stand upside down?

47
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,516
Where did you get this from?

48
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,954
- Joseph!
- Come, dude!

49
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,985
Someone has dropped
elephant dung here!

50
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,126
What the hell should I do if an elephant
shits on your doorstep? Get lost!

51
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,003
'Shit only if necessary'

52
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,472
Hey!

53
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,804
Haven't I told you not to
wear 'm und u' in the cam pus?

54
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:50,135
'Flowers bloom here in every season'

55
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:53,049
Anwar, what's this? Why did
you take credit for his poem?

56
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,047
Why bother about the credit? You
just want people to read it, right?

57
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,849
Brother, it's my poem!

58
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,878
'Flowers bloom here in every season'

59
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,521
'Some fall down,
some bear fruits'

60
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,351
'For Jomy'

61
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,959
'Some fly high in the
paths of the clouds'

62
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:14,559
'Finally, their fragrances
became just a memory'

63
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,373
'They stopped down and moved
on with those memories in our hearts'

64
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,944
- Subhash!
- What is it?

65
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,221
I can't understand anything!

66
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,092
Dude,

67
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,260
who is that?

68
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,795
This?

69
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,986
He's the teacher who taught
me Malayalam in 8th grade.

70
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,159
Mullanezhi Master.

71
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:46,336
Usually, I sit quietly
on the back bench.

72
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,971
One day, Sir came
to me and told me,

73
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,366
'You are good! You will do well'

74
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,006
Till date, I haven't understood
why he told that to me.

75
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,171
What are you studying?

76
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,414
Me? Physics.

77
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,414
Underline the main equations alone.
Give it to me.

78
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,087
I am doing that.
I have underlined them.

79
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,593
- Jomy, what's your main subject?
- Physics.

80
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,626
Sub?

81
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:11,983
Maths!

82
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,225
Then why are you studying
from an Economics book?

83
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,021
So you're studying
from my Physics book?

84
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,433
That's English literature, Jomy!

85
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,606
- Is this English literature?
- Is your condition so pathetic?

86
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,968
Hold the other end.
Tie it!

87
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,104
Not this one.
Keep that board.

88
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,307
I can't be supportive of something,

89
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,114
that you're doing as a group.

90
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,189
Sir, a family's
survival is at stake!

91
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,552
Are you serious?

92
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,554
We're sincere, Sir.

93
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,131
Let me see.

94
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,060
- This guy?
- I want to meet Roopesh Chettan.

95
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,370
What is it?

96
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:05,113
Roopesh Chetta, you know Jomy?
The fatty from our batch?

97
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,172
He is not able to
study, Roopeshetta!

98
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,284
Se?

99
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,548
Yohannan Sir has arranged
a prayer meeting.

100
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,355
You should inaugurate
that, please.

101
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,980
Is it okay if I do it?

102
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:16,959
Well..

103
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,449
If Roopeshettan comes,

104
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,157
it will be inspiring
for the students!

105
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,494
I heard that you're collecting
money from juniors!

106
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,934
It's a meeting which seniors
are attending, right? $0..

107
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,661
It was for that.

108
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,370
After the prayer meeting, we've
planned a feast as well!

109
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:33,676
The girls are coming?

110
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,639
We were intending to
give tea <i>&</i> snacks.

111
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,204
- There will be tea?
- Yes!

112
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,637
And snacks as well!

113
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:40,672
Then we'll come!

114
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,084
Won't you come, Roopeshetta?

115
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,180
So you'll be coming, right?
Okay!

116
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,182
- For quite sometime,

117
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,196
Jomy is not able to give his
full attention to studies.

118
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,093
He is haunted by responsibilities
and mental turmoils.

119
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,730
I'm not exaggerating, friends.

120
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,958
He has 5 sisters who are
of marriage-able age.

121
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,937
Five!

122
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,228
For the inauguration of our new club
- Bermuda Triangle,

123
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:08,143
and for the inauguration of the club's
first endeavour - Jomy's studies,

124
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:12,238
I welcome our undeniable leader, Shri
Roopesh Chettan to the dais.

125
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,048
- Now he'll start off
with his Mekkala speech.

126
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:20,445
In our education field, which is
possessed by the ghost of Mekkala,

127
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,359
the waves of change
that were built!

128
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,783
It is time for us to open our
third eyes and be cautious,

129
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,553
against the move by the Government
to destroy us through violence,

130
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,228
through their
Thuglaq-ian reforms!

131
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,398
When this hostel began
functioning in 1906,

132
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,461
there were 2 separate hostels!

133
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,440
Isn't it 1908?

134
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,603
- Is it 8 or 9?
- What if it's 89?

135
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,010
- It was somewhere in the middle.
- Whatever it maybe!

136
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,105
When it started
functioning ages ago,

137
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,740
one hostel was for Hindus,

138
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,643
and the other one
was for Christians.

139
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,608
A lot of changes have
happened since then!

140
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,247
But even now, there are 2 hostels!

141
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,291
This one for boys and
that one for girls!

142
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:58,519
I sincerely hope <i>&</i> pray that these two
combine to become one single hostel!

143
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:04,762
I am inaugurating Jomy's studies, which
has been initiated by this club!

144
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,603
I hope God blesses him.

145
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,137
Bow your head!

146
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,802
We're going to start with the
cultural activities now.

147
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,374
Firstly, it's a folk song!

148
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,834
Nambola, sing in style, man!

149
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,714
Hey! You will sing only after cutting
your hair& having a bath!

150
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,717
Didn't you hear me?
Get lost!

151
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,253
'Rasna' is here.

152
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,361
- Chetta, please take one.

153
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,498
Come, dude!

154
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,700
What is this?

155
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,890
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

156
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,282
Such a useless program!

157
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,445
- Listen to the rest.
- Tell me Shiyaz Ikka.

158
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,420
She was a long time
desire of mine, right?

159
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,691
It happened yesterday!

160
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,127
And?

161
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,552
Do you know what she told
me after we were done?

162
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,320
Not to start this so
late in life, right?

163
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,459
How did you know that?

164
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,567
Fill this.

165
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,703
One more glass.

166
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,097
Oh. This is empty already?

167
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,575
Pour one more glass!

168
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,273
- Do you have any money left from the fund?
- I don't know, Chetta!

169
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,515
Eating only with others' cash,
bloody a-hole!

170
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:43,522
Eating only with others' cash,
bloody a-hole!

171
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,638
Hey!

172
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:50,833
What did you just say?

173
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,307
I said you may drink <i>&</i> leave, Chetta!

174
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,639
I will chop your head, you swine!
Say it 50 times!

175
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,703
- What?
- I said you may drink <i>&</i> leave, Chetta!

176
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:58,881
Say <i>m</i>

177
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,708
- Say it aloud!
- What happened?

178
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,409
I said he can drink & leave.
For that, he is".

179
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,817
Say it 50 times!

180
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,650
What's the problem?

181
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,656
- I asked him to drink <i>&</i> leave.
- Didn't he say sorry?

182
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,150
Who are you to interfere in this?

183
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,129
Don't hit him, Shibu!

184
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,561
- Who do you think you are?
- Shibu!

185
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,653
What's the problem?

186
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,260
Don't think you can mess with
me because I ate at your feast!

187
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,591
- Wait <i>&</i> watch what I'm going to do!

188
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,697
- Wait <i>&</i> watch!
- Ya! We'll see! Get going!

189
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,273
- Get lost!
- Enough! Stop it!!

190
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,147
Oh my god!

191
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,773
- What are you doing?
- What's the problem?

192
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,374
Roopesh, we have
to beat them up!

193
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,712
There you go again!

194
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,147
You just keep blabbering
all the time!

195
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,278
They tried to mess with me,
we have to bash them up!

196
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,879
- I was"
- Hey Monappan, what is it?

197
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,791
- Where's my 'Fire' magazine?
- That's not there!

198
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,793
My dear Ikka, make him understand!

199
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:46,862
What's the problem?

200
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:47,985
Nothing, Shiyaz Ikka.

201
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,654
Silly kids <i>&</i> their silly fights!

202
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,827
The kids are not like earlier!

203
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,732
We are in an urgent discussion!
Get going!

204
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,431
We will be discussing till sunrise.
Don't disturb us again!

205
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,774
Phew! It's all a mess now!

206
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,275
So loud!

207
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,442
Hold this!

208
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:01,476
Eat this piece.

209
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,311
The juniors did a great job!

210
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,448
But, that weed-head is furious!

211
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,577
There are chances for a fight to start.

212
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,744
Will you be able to bear
a pounding now, Subhash?

213
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:12,681
Let them come to fight!

214
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,189
We will break their heads!

215
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:17,893
Really?

216
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,260
Eat one more piece!

217
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,290
That kid is saying that he'll break
the heads of those who'll fight them!

218
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,464
- He is bragging!
- That kid is asking for a pounding!

219
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,840
After finishing the chicken, I'll knock
the living daylights out of him!

220
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,877
- Are you sure?
- Don't you know me well?

221
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,707
I just want to see it happening!

222
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:37,707
Fight after dinner!

223
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,270
There's a fight after dinner.

224
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,716
Dude, there's a
fight after dinner.

225
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,982
There's a fight after dinner!

226
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,721
There's a fight after dinner.

227
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,623
- Only after dinner, right?
- I hope it happens!

228
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,699
Subhash!

229
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,700
What's the plan? They
are standing outside.

230
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,470
We will break their arms <i>&</i> legs!

231
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:03,706
Sure?

232
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,398
If this was our Irinjalakkuda,

233
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,345
- I would've smashed them to pulp!
- Shut up!

234
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,672
It hasn't started?

235
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,841
They're saying they will
break your arms <i>&</i> legs!

236
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,350
I went in to give them a dose.
They are silly kids, dude!

237
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,874
Ask them to come out, dude!

238
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,684
I'll show them whose
bones will be broken!

239
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:19,745
It'll start now!

240
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,346
Huh? What's the problem outside?

241
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,883
We're going to bash
up the juniors!

242
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,851
- Don't leave any clues.
- Done!

243
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,661
- Bye, Ikka!
- Fight well, son!

244
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,258
They've come with iron rods!

245
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,302
We are brave!

246
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,562
And ready to bear it!

247
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,838
Ready to kill?

248
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,439
Ready to bear,

249
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,067
and ready to kill!

250
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,606
This is going to be awesome!

251
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,613
Come!

252
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,837
Rajesh Chettan, sit here!

253
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:47,816
Sit down!

254
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:49,879
It's a problem that we started!

255
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,742
We will finish it ourselves!

256
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:52,721
Hey! Subhash!

257
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,616
That weed-head is crazy!

258
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,350
You don't have to fight unnecessarily!

259
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,688
We can't back off now.

260
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:58,921
Hey Sahjay, come!

261
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,896
They said they will kill you! And if
you're lucky, you won't lose a hand!

262
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,862
We should finish them!

263
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,403
Shall I bring the tools then?

264
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:09,571
They're here?

265
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,008
Come!

266
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,847
You start! We'll take care of the rest!

267
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:19,915
Me?

268
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,007
- How can that be?
- Just start it!

269
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,451
You fool! He is elder to me!

270
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,487
That's why!

271
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,123
- Go!
- He is shit scared of me!

272
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,416
He might run away!

273
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,458
Go!

274
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,395
If you don't mind,

275
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,932
shall we fight
tomorrow afternoon?

276
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,694
It's already night now.

277
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,694
It is said that wars are
not fought at night.

278
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,606
We don't mind fighting
during the night.

279
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:46,742
Is it?

280
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,741
Dude, it's like that in Kannur.

281
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,601
There're no days <i>&</i>
nights for fights!

282
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:51,603
- What a place!
- Hey!

283
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,115
Isn't it?

284
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,710
Move away!

285
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,841
- Move, you swine!
- The power is gone!

286
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,118
Don't start fighting! You
might hit the wrong person!

287
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,124
Hello?

288
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,158
KSEB?

289
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,926
I'm calling from
Maharaja College.

290
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,723
There's a power cut
here at the hostel.

291
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,487
Will it come now?

292
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,126
There's a grand program
happening here.

293
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,135
Hello?

294
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,399
Bro, we just want
power at the hostel!

295
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,629
They also lost power?

296
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,735
I hope I can see it
from the beginning!

297
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,472
- Roopesh, lock the door!

298
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,771
- For our safety!

299
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,503
- That's not the problem, Shiyaz Ikka!

300
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,744
- I can't find my 'mundu'.

301
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,728
Bunch of lunatics!

302
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,990

Stand up!

305
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,021
Tell me!

IUPAC name of laughing gas.

307
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,518
Didn't you understand?

308
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,989
IUPAC name of laughing gas.

309
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,634
What is it?
Tell me!

310
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,835
'56 pieces of boiled potatoes'

311
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:28,877
Get out!

312
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,046
Sorry Sir!

313
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,008
You guys stay here <i>&</i>
enjoy the torture!

314
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,524
Hey!

315
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,596
Me?

316
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:48,664
Come!

317
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:52,996
I hope it hasn't started!

318
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,537
What? Didn't you go to
class for first hour?

319
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,563
He asked me to get out.

320
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,542
Why?

321
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:01,901
Just for smiling.

322
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,242
Hereafter, I should never see
you smiling in this campus!

323
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,150
'Even though Sir asked me not to smile,

324
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,711
I still saw many kinds of
smiles in the college'

325
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:13,912
'Sheepish smile,

00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,924
'None of these were
the actual smile'

331
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,288
'This is the real deal,
the real smile, dude!'

332
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,910
'And, I really liked her song'

Dude, I saw your girl.

336
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,153
She looks really dinky!

337
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,223
Dinky?

338
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,553
I mean, she's pretty!

339
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:50,751
Did you tell her?

340
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:51,793
No! I haven't.

341
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,090
Tell her as soon as possible!

342
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,824
Or else, smarter guys
will take her away!

343
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,298
An“!

344

Next time when you come
for the arts festival,

I will be dressed in white.

347

And I expect that you will
also be dressed in white.

00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,752
Dude, you can wear my Iungi if you want to.
But don't get it starched!

00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,023
Don't laugh!

00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:24,950
- Dude!
- What?

354
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,093
Shall I also get Ajayettan to
write a love letter for me?

355
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,798
Talk to her directly, dude!

356
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,366
Dude!

357
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,694
If I go directly"

358
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,862
Then, shall I tell her?

359
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:35,961
Subhash, phone for you!

360
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,061
Huh?

361
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,662
- Phone for you!
- Write that as well!

362
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:39,730
That will work!

363
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:40,709
Jomy!

364
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:42,703
You go talk to her for me.

365
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,604
- And say that I love her!
- Dude,

366
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,204
If a third person gets
involved in a romance,

367
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,809
it will always end
up being screwed up!

368
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,819
And if you love her,
go say that to her!

369
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,286
That burden will
be off your chest!

370
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,658
If I go say that directly...

371
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:58,727
No, man!

372
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,591
Right now, I have at least
the hope that she likes me.

373
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,167
If I go <i>&</i> tell her directly,

374
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,634
if she says that she doesn't
like me, on my face,

375
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,199
I will be shattered, dude!

376
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,272
That's all!

377
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,766
Then I'll end up being
a wreck like Ajayettan,

378
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,868
drinking and smoking
all the time!

379
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,610
Ajayettan can at least sketch well!

380
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:18,670
I don't even know that!

381
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:19,909
I'll just be a plain wreck!

382
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,684
(Anu's song plays)

383
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,389
Awesome!

384
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:30,759
Stop the damn song!

385
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,385
If I hear that song again,
I'll break that tape recorder!

386
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,364
Don't bother!

387
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,133
Him <i>&</i> his bloody song!

388
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,435
If we have to talk about life,

389
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,931
it is just a momentary moment!

390
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,269
I'm not interested!

391
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,074
Don't waste your
time following me!

392
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:51,813
It's okay!

393
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:52,903
There she is!

394
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,384
I've proposed to 11 girls.
You are the 12th one.

395
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,940
If you also reject me,

396
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,209
If you don't want to say it
in front of me, it's okay.

397
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,746
Take her to the canteen,

398
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,052
have a tea and say it!

399
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,089
- Tell her!
- Anu, one minute!

400
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:05,921
I want to say something.

401
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,062
What?

402
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,460
I really like you.
I swear!

403
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:11,767
I swear on God!

404
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:14,936
I like you too!

405
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:16,772
How's it?

406
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,031
What do you want now?

407
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:19,474
Really?

408
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,089
She'll do it just
like 'Panchali'?

409
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,788
Not here, on the stage!

410
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,867
Don't forget to call me
when you disrobe her!

411
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:47,860
Don't fall down!

412
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,803
Roopesh, she is taking
part in the arts fest.

413
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,228
Looks like you're
really nervous!

414
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,329
Yea! True!

415
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,308
Just bless her!

416
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,307
These are all old
traditions, right?

417
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:57,835
It's not like that nowadays!

418
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:58,836
Hey, leave her!

419
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,145
That's not necessary!

420
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:01,980
Anyway, all the best!
Don't worry! OK?

421
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,483
Are you relieved now?

422
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,988
She's a first year student.

423
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,178
She is hell bent on
taking part in 4 items.

424
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,056
- She is close to me.
- Which all items?

425
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,983
Bharatnatyam, Mohiniyattam,
Kuchipudi, Folk Dance.

426
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:13,962
Amazing!

427
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,224
So many items at hand, huh?

428
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,062
Chetta, I had A grade for all
subjects during pre-degree.

429
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,500
Anyway, give me that application.
I'll let you know.

430
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,102
It's a good thing.
We'll think about it.

431
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,208
Chetta, shall we do a programme
in college and then..

432
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,505
It's a good idea.
Let's think about it!

433
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,347
Give it! Let me see!

434
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,749
No phone number.
Everything else is there.

435
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,411
She doesn't have to come
for this arts fest!

436
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:42,390
Why?

437
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,549
Let her come. What's this?

438
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,082
She looks really arrogant!

439
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,824
Her bloody Kuchipudi!

440
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,194
Many people who smile at you,

441
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,563
are people who gossip about
you behind your back!

442
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:59,040
Find out who all are gossiping
about me, and let me know.

443
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,538
Then I'll know who they are!

444
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,777
I won't say it!

445
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,573
Even I'll become a
gossiper then!

446
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:07,011
I've told her that you'll set
everything right. She is waiting there.

447
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,980
This is the right
time for us to act!

448
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,520
It's not right if only KSQ
supporters are allowed on stage!

449
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,217
- How many items does she want to do?
- Four, I think.

450
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,255
If she wins at least
one item among them,

451
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,190
she will be coming back
holding an SFY flag!

452
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,489
That's correct!

453
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,556
You wait here <i>&</i> warn
me if someone comes!

454
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:30,401
Mono-act, Mohiniyattam, Elocution,
Story Narration, right? 4 items!

455
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,597
Check if your initials
are correct, Ardra.

456
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,405
Here you go!
For mono-act!

457
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,606
Jomy, this girl is taking
part in mono-act!

458
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,240
You're doing that?

459
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:40,838
My dear Jomy,

460
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,872
you do one thing.

461
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:46,583
Try items like Sanskrit Poetry or Yakshagana
which won't have many people participating

462
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,089
OK!

463
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,121
- B.A. History, right?
- Subhash!

464
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,320
I've fixed Yakshagana!

465
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,828
I'll go get another form.

466
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,630
The date of birth
is correct, right?

467
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,630
Can you please make a
neat copy of this?

468
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:00,635
And,

469
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,930
only few people know
about this double entry.

470
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,303
No one should know
this apart from us.

471
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,312
<i>- Krishna“, fight'?
- Yes.</i>

472
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,041
I've seen you <i>& a</i> girl sitting
together at many places.

473
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,020
Se?

474
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:20,986
Is it right to sit
together like that?

475
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,618
If we sit together,

476
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,920
is it wrong, Sir?

477
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:25,593
It's not wrong?

478
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,951
- It's not wrong?
- Great!

479
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,090
It might not be wrong!

480
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,126
Keep it away.
Someone's coming!

481
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:37,105
Keep it away!

482
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,303
It was you?
Bloody!

483
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,477
Haritha, get those forms!
And fill the rest.

484
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,341
Ardra, you have to do 4 items
to be a 'Kalathilakam' (all-rounder)

485
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,440
- What?
- I told her!

486
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,017
Okay.

487
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,240
For Bharatnatyam...

488
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,187
- I told Anu that I love her!
- OK.

489
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,287
So it's better that you do it..

490
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,018
Dude, I told her
that I love her!

491
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,318
And what did she say?

492
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,689
She told me that
she loves me too.

493
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,626
- So soon?
- Ya!

494
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,427
Then she went away!

495
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:05,623
She must be kidding!

496
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,000
Dude, she said it on my face,
that she loves me!

497
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,070
Get lost!

498
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,938
He was there with me.
Ask him!

499
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,005
Hey!

500
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,097
Did she.. Did she say
that she loves him?

501
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,510
She says that to everyone.
Get lost, dude!

502
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:17,945
You get lost!

503
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:19,242
- That's Yakshagana, check it!

504
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,282
Dude,

505
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,211
It's not like what he said.

506
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,708
She rejected Jose Baby <i>&</i>
said this on my face.

507
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,377
- That she loves you?
- And she asked me what to do next!

508
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,153
- What should I do next with this?
- Hello?

509
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,988
Can't you see that
I'm talking to him?

510
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,928
Dude, check this form!

511
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,928
- Jomy, one minute!
- Please! Please!

512
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,192
- Dude, Kannada. Please!
- What the hell! Get lost!

513
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:38,733
You tell me!

514
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,365
Dude, how do I take
this to the next level?

515
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,405
Dude,

516
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:47,538
the most basic aspect in
romance is proximity.

517
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,705
So maintain that.

518
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:53,012
Dude, now tell me in a way
that I can understand it.

519
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,208
What I meant was, closeness!

520
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:56,573
That is,

521
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,713
she should feel your presence
around her all the time.

522
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,011
So wherever she goes, you
also have to go there.

523
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:01,990
Got it?

524
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:03,517
Where is she now?

525
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:05,994
- Where is she now?
- I'll search!

526
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,358
Go! Go search &find out!

527
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,530
- Get lost you monkey!
- You also get going!

528
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:11,566
I should go?

529
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,074
Come here!

530
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:20,735
Are you acting in the play?

531
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,277
Then get lost!

532
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,745
Get lost!

533
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,540
Bloody nuisance!

534
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,281
Well, why am I going back?

535
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,091
I'll finish him..

536
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:39,061
<i>Chem, Anu asked
me to come here.</i>

537
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,361
Does this thing bite?

538
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,435
Chetta, three teas!

539
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,138
What was the beginning
of that song?

540
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,418
Hello!

541
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:04,452
Hello!

542
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,053
How was the play?

543
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,519
I sat there for a while.

544
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,422
You are acting amazingly
well in the play!

545
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:14,496
Thank you!

546
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,595
Who is that guy who
acted as Bhima?

547
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:18,633
That gull--

548
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,196
He was the best actor
at Calicut University.

549
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,329
But he's not that great!

550
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,633
Something is..

551
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,037
Something is missing, right?
I thought so!

552
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,504
You sing really well!

553
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:32,836
When you sang that 'Ghanashyamd
song, I was there.

554
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:33,815
You were there?

555
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:36,484
And,

556
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,278
do you like Western m usic?

557
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,586
- Yes! I like it!
- Is it?

558
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,146
Then shall I make you listen
to the song we rehearsed?

559
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,125
Ya!

560
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:46,594
Here VOu go!

561
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,298
Who is your favourite artist?

562
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,498
- No one in particular.
- Is it?

563
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:55,804
I'll play it.

564
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,833
What's the name of this song?

565
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,142
Gosh! Talk softly!

566
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:05,346
OOPs!

567
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,780
What's the name of this song?

568
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,717
It's name is 'Seasons
of Life' by Westlife.

569
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,647
I didn't realize I was loud
because this was playing"

570
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,688
Of course!

571
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,884
This is a song which
has a party mood!

572
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,259
It has a party mood!

573
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,756
I like soft songs mostly.

574
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,389
- Me too!
- Is it?

575
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,865
- Shall I play that then?
- Ya!

576
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,254
- Where were you?
- I went to take a shit.

577
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:52,861
Dude!

578
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:54,262
Come here!

579
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:55,622
Isn't this my T-shirt?

580
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,220
Isn't this my tee?

581
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,564
Let me wear it once, man!

582
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,557
You wear it. But can't you
ask me before wearing?

583
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,128
It's because I don't
have any, Paul!

584
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,763
Then buy some tees
like this one!

585
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,365
- I don't have the money, man!
- Your damn sentiments!

586
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,635
Subhash, call for you!

587
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,902
Subhash, call for you!

588
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,639
Subhash, call for you!

589
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,372
Phone call! Go!

590
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,950
Whose book is this? You must've
stolen it from someone!

591
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,294
This was lying here, Paul!
I won't eat it!

592
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,390
The call isn't for me.

593
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,831
Not for you?
Then for whom?

594
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:33,868
It's for you!

595
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,303
Who is it?

596
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:40,542
It's An u, dude!

597
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,269
At this time?
Huh?

598
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:47,541
Maybe she wants to discuss our future,
with me. (imitating Mohanlars voice)

599
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,575
Please don't misunderstand me!

600
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,649
So you don't need us now?

601
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:53,555
Carry on!

602
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,412
Jomv. let's jam!

603
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,290
Let me see how your

- Hello Paul, it's me, Anu!
- Oh! Anu, tell me!

608
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,290
How come you've called?

609
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,021
Nothing! What are you doing?

610
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,021
- Nothing! I was just
chilling in the hostel.

611
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:36,554
What are you doing, An u?

612
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,390
I am also in the hostel.

613
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,961
- Did you have dinner'?
- Ya!

614
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,534
Hey Paul, can you
do me a favour?

615
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:45,607
Yes. Tell me!

616
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,366
- Can you arrange a camera?

617
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,440
We want to get our
programme covered.

618
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,036
I'll need it only when it's
time for the program me!

619
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,277
Only if you have one.

620
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,449
I have it with me.
I'll get it!

621
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:58,748
- I'll get the camera!
- Is it?

622
00:37:58,876 --> 00:37:59,854
Thank you!

623
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:01,511
It's okay!

624
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,746
- Okay then, shall I hang up?

625
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:03,817
Anu, don't hang up!

626
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,326
I want to ask something.

627
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,324
What's your favourite colour'?

628
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,863
My favourite colour..

629
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:11,966
Is Violet!

630
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,797
Really?
Is it Violet?

631
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,892
Mine too!
Same pinch!

632
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,304

709
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,798
'For the next arts festival,

710
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,773
I will be dressed in white.'

711
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,442
'I hope you will also
come dressed in white'

712
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,370
When did you reach, Reina?

713
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,873
I reached in the morning.

714
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,743
Which programme are you doing?

715
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,812
Programme" Well.. I'm singing!

716
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,918
You're singing? Nice.
- This is Jomy!

717
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,255
Hi!
<i>~</i> Hi!

718
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,085
<i>This is Saab“.</i>

719
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:22,895
We are friends.

720
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,164
And we're neighours as well.

721
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,489
Is it?

722
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,766
Our date of birth is the same!
- So?

723
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,337
We were even baptized together.

724
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,496
We studied together
in LP school as well.

725
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:34,976
Why are we like this?

726
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,100
Jomy! Hey!

727
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,474
Which programme are you doing?

728
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:39,876
Where's the closest toddy shop?

729
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,379
An“!

730
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,825
Got it?
- Yes.

731
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,794
From where?
- It's my friend's camera.

732
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:58,332
This is zoom.

733
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,326
And this is focus.
You know, right?

734
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,063
And I've already loaded the film.

735
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:06,499
<i>She's gone, Chem'.!</i>

736
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:07,742
Who?

737
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:08,798
Reina!

738
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:09,777
Myhaa?

739
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:10,971
Not Mynaa.
Reina!

740
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:12,939
Where did she go?

741
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,372
During the last arts fest, she told me
that we'll meet for this arts fest.

742
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:17,406
And did you meet her?

743
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,478
I went dressed in white to meet her, and"

744
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:20,487
And?

745
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:22,912
Tell me!

746
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,221
She went with some other guy!

747
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:28,359
You don't even have money to buy a
bottle of toddy. Who will come with you?

748
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:29,957
Get lost!

749
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:30,998
<i>Great'.!</i>

750
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,464
I'll mind my own business!

751
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:37,972
I'm leaving!

752
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:40,030
Pay the money!
- No! I don't have to do that!

753
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,371
Pay the money & go!

754
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:48,315
(singing a Boney M song)

755
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,479
She is singing well, right?

756
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:52,780
Oh! You're back?

757
00:46:58,949 --> 00:46:59,927
Dude!

758
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,194
There's a lot of
love in her eyes!

759
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:04,587
Each one of them will have love!

760
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,295
But it will be for random guys!

761
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,596
Her bloody song!

762
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,062
What happened to him?

763
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:20,543
You &your damn claps!

764
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,810
Babilona! Ya right!

765
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:27,081
Chetta, please move.

766
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,823
Next is Ardra's programme.

767
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,552
Next one?
Let's go bring her. Come!

768
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:32,560
Let's

769
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,428
This is my 14th proposal.

770
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:39,328
All of you are tensed, right?

771
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:40,990
Don't worry!

772
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,595
I have sorted everything out!

773
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:45,901
You're 104, right?

774
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,007
Get going!

775
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:48,843
Don't worry!

776
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:51,173
- Do well!
- Monappan, I could only touch her hair.

777
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:53,280
Who is this?

778
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:54,849
Hey!

779
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,275
Why are you here?

780
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,844
He lands up wherever there are girls!
Bloody rat! Get going!

781
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:03,151
Hey! Not that way!
This way!

782
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:05,584
Look at his bloody crown!

783
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,655
Where do such losers come from?

784
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:12,129
They've announced your number.
112, right? Go!

785
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,460
Hey, all the best!

786
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,444
Let the arts fest get over. I'll
smash that weed-head's face.

787
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,516
If she wins the first
prize, it will be awesome!

788
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,247
Fifty!

789
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,106
5O

790
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:06,348
Paul, come outside.

791
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,144
Let the play get done.

792
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:09,385
I noticed a couple of times.

793
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,323
He has been talking to Anu.

794
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,418
What if someone talks to her?

795
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,418
What's the problem?
- Jomy,

796
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,558
I saw Anu talking to that
guy a couple of times.

797
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,725
I sense something wrong.

798
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,197
If you can, come outwith Paul.
I'll be waiting outside.

799
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,597
We should ask her!

800
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,560
It won't be right if you don't ask her!

801
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:25,539
Dude!

802
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,336
I trust her! Then why
should I ask her!

803
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:30,232
You should ask! - If there's something
like that, I'll know it first.

804
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,371
No! You must ask her!

805
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:34,708
I want to ask her!

806
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,113
Come! Get up!
- Okay. We'll ask!

807
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:39,120
Where are you guys going?
- We'll be right back.

808
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,346
- 20 minutes have passed.

809
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:45,253
- This is the amazing
climax of our play.

810
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:49,194
- Thanks to everyone who
co-operated with 'The Ladder'.

811
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:53,131
- Law College's next play
will be performed next year.

812
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,598
Where were you all this while?

813
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,659
I was backstage.

814
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,672
You didn't see my programme, right?
- I saw it!

815
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,500
Come!
- I'm coming! Leave my hand!

816
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,643
Come!

817
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:06,546
Hurry up! She will leave!
- I'm coming!

818
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,216
Ask her!

819
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,250
Come!

820
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:11,986
An“!

821
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:13,350
She's also in white.
- Hi Paul!

822
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,021
You ask her.

823
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:16,617
Are you leaving?
- Yes.

824
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,420
Oops! I forgot to
return your camera.

825
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,091
Some more film is left in it.

826
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,032
Thank you. It was very useful!

827
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,100
It's okay.

828
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,630
Paul, this is Vivek.

829
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,202
Haven't I told you about Paul?
- Yes.

830
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:33,773
Vivek is my lover.

831
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,671
We're not waiting till all
the programmes are done.

832
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,579
We'll meet in college, Paul.

833
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:39,780
Bye.

834
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:41,608
Did you see our programme?

835
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,275
Yes!
- Oh! You saw it?

836
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:44,711
Okay.
Good night!

837
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:45,786
Good night!

838
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,184
Paul, can you get the film
washed <i>&</i> make prints for me?

839
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,530
Okay.

840
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:58,455
Okay. Thank you!

841
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,767
Bye!
- Bye.

842
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:08,099
TMV

843
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:10,641
- Am I not better than him?

844
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,240
- Tell me, master!

845
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:13,672
I am the better person!

846
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,582
I am better than him!

847
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:19,377
- Why are you saying that
he is better than me?

848
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,689
Will this get over anytime soon?
- Never, Bheeman!

849
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,656
- I will prove it to you!

850
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:26,186
- Look into his eyes.

851
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:27,828
- He is blind.

852
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:29,463
Master!

853
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,665
Master!

854
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:34,135
- Look! He is far
more superior to you!

855
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,659
- And not someone who has achieved
only a half-victory like you!

856
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,298
- Half-Victory isn't
enough, Bheeman!

857
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,377
'Let everything be destroyed'

858
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,411
Monappan Chetta,

859
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,844
Monappan Chetta,
- Tell me, dude.

860
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,487
If we're in love with a girl,

861
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,686
It's okay even if she
doesn't love us back;

862
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:00,527
But..

863
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:04,298
The heartbreak that happens when we
hear that she loves someone else..

864
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:14,201
'Oh my dear boyfriend'

865
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:16,799
'Oh my dear girlfriend'

866
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,211
Stop your damn song!

867
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,214
It makes me even sadder!

868
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:21,543
No! Don't sing!

869
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:23,650
What happened?

870
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,448
It is said that women
are like balloons.

871
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,557
If you keep it in your
hands and open them,

872
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:30,783
it will fly away!

873
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,554
And if you try to
hold it tighter,

874
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:33,794
it will burst!

875
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:36,286
What happened?
- Gone!

876
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:37,364
Who?

877
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:38,432
She's gone!

878
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:39,766
<i>W h“?
An“?</i>

879
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:41,267
She betrayed him!

880
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,133
You're there for me, right?

881
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:46,872
Yes! I'm there for you!
Don't worry!

882
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,368
You should contest in the election!

883
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:50,410
You should win!

884
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,945
I will shout slogans for you!

885
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,141
Won't you do it, Chetta?

886
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:55,771
Won't you do it?

887
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:56,842
I have to think about it!

888
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,440
Hail, Subhash!

889
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:00,614
Hey Paul, women are
a special species!

890
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,255
Even if she's your
wife or a girlfriend,

891
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,813
mother or sister,

892
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:06,225
all of them are sluts!

893
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,887
That's the universal truth!
- No!

894
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,388
My mother is not a slut!

895
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:12,160
What's special about your mom?
Even she's a slut!

896
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:14,591
You'll curse my mother?

897
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:17,765
Bloody b@$tard! Don't talk
nonsense when you're drunk!

898
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:18,805
Kill him!

899
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,465
Pick him up!

900
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:22,298
Get up!

901
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,301
<i>I will</i> smash him to pulp!
- Get lost!

902
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,476
Go out, you drunkard!

903
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:28,916
You sit down!

904
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:30,542
What is this, dude?

905
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:34,646
He comes to our room, drinks our booze,
eats our food, and curses my mom!

906
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,781
Should I kiss him for that?

907
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,782
Actually, I think his
mom is not such a slut.

908
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,820
He is really angry. He will kill you.
Get going!

909
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,486
This is why that
girl dumped you!

910
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:46,296
He invited me and bashed me up!

911
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,290
III-

912
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,463
Lie down.
Enough!

913
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:00,005
Jomy, get up <i>&</i> go sleep.

914
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,680
Krishnanl!
Hey Krishnan!

915
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:07,885
You go there and see if she
is ready for folk dance.

916
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,421
She is ready there.

917
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:10,657
Ardra!

918
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,715
Subhash, she's going!
- Where is she going?

919
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,525
When did you come, dad?
- Just now.

920
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,025
Subhashetta, these are my parents.

921
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,232
Parents?

922
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,800
Who gave you permission
to come out now?

923
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:22,666
Don't you know that Roopesh shouldn't see
you until you finish your programme?

924
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:23,796
Dude, take her inside.

925
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:26,729
Ardra, come!
- Dude!

926
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,607
You come here!
Take them inside.

927
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,501
<i>Come, Chem'.
- Phase.</i>

928
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,739
This is the 4th gear, and
this is the reverse gear.

929
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,507
Don't you know which
is the reverse gear'?

930
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:35,879
I'll show it to you.
Just hold it..

931
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:36,974
Hey ROOpesh!

932
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,281
ThatArdra has done 3-4
programmes on stage.

933
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:41,410
What program mes?

934
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:42,981
You're busy with your
programme here, right?

935
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,024
Aren't you coming?

936
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:46,627
You wait here.

937
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,693
I'll be right back.
- I'm so pissed off!

938
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,400
Ardra's turn may be after
a couple of programmes.

939
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,065
You can sit here!

940
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:08,199
TMV

941
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:20,054
How is it?
- We'll put an end to this! Come!

942
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:26,097
Who are the committee
members here?

943
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:27,826
What's the problem?

944
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:29,393
Who gave permission for
that girl to dance here?

945
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,803
She gave us an application.
That's why she is dancing!

946
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:34,738
How can she give you an application
without the chairman's knowledge?

947
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,835
You will let people participate
without giving applications?

948
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,447
Roopesh, that's different.
This is different.

949
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,939
Come, watch the show,
enjoy it and go back!

950
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,442
I will go <i>&</i> get this stopped.
You wanna see it?

951
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:48,777
You can give such challenges back in
college. We are doing this programme.

952
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,621
If you want to watch
it, watch it <i>&</i> leave!

953
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:57,488
You don't try to mess with us here!
- You're not fit to stand against Roopesh!

954
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,788
You will be coming back
to that same college!

955
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,097
Stop it!
<i>'</i> R°0pesh!

956
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:03,831
What is it?
Get lost!

957
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:05,964
If you can, come here and do it!

958
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,604
Who does he think he is?
Ask him to get lost! Idiot!

959
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:16,010
Dude, clap for her!

960
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:27,649
If there are any stout-hearted
guys from KSQ, come backstage!

961
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,425
SFY guys are waiting for you!

962
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:37,831
- My dear friends,

963
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:41,772
- The MG University Arts Fest
has reached its finale.

964
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:45,139
To inaugurate the closing ceremony,

965
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,669
we have amongst us, a talented
artist and moreover,

966
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,505
a left-wing supporter;

967
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:51,144
I welcome our dear
comrade Jayaraj Warrier,

968
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:53,153
to speak a few words.

969
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:00,118
Who is this bloody fool?

970
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:03,630
Hail SFY!

971
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:07,022
Hail SFY!

972
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:08,001
Hail...

973

Hail KSQ!

975
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:19,612
I wish that this Arts Fest by
Mahatma Gandhi University,

976
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:22,750
is able to create great
artists of the future,

977
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:24,749
from the bottom of my heart!

978
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,849
I'm announcing the name of the
'Kala Thilakam' (all-round winner)

979
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,151

When she comes, we have to put this on her.
This is our first victory!

987
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,255
Hold this garland.

988
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,955
We will get some respect
in college now!

989
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:14,936
I want to talk to those guys after this!

990
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:16,999
Subhash, Ardra has left!

991
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,060
With whom?

992
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,039
Over there!

993
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:22,197
Hail KSQ!!

We won the all-rounder cup!

996
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:33,019
Hail KSQ!

997
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,300
Hey, this is the last vehicle
going to our college. Come, hop on!

998
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,849
Subhash, don't worry! We'll get
it back for the sports fest!

999
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:08,548
We don't care if we win or lose!
To hell with the winners!

1000
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:09,645
Bro, let's go!

1001
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:10,946
Let's go!
- Okay Bye. Red Salute!

1002
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:14,292
We don't care if we win or lose!
To hell with the winners!

1003
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,032
He's having a headache.
- What happened?

1004
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:28,870
Get up!
- He had a headache!

1005
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:31,334
Get up!
- I think he has a bad headache!

1006
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:32,779
Go change your clothes!

1007
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:33,813
Hurry up!

1008
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,848
Who ever... Hold this.
Wear your glasses.

1009
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:37,673
Wear it!

1010
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,621
You're waiting for heartbreaks, to
make people buy booze for you, right?

1011
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:42,117
Hold this!
Get going!

1012
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:44,146
He said he was feeling"
- Get changed!

1013
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:47,094
I'm not coming to college. I can't
face her. - Who's going to college?

1014
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:50,285
I can't face her.
- Why are you drinking? You shut up!

1015
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:53,188
What do you want to prove by drinking
& putting up this tragic hero act?

1016
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:56,170
She's walking around happily over there!
- You get changed quickly!

1017
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,363
Hey!
Get going!

1018
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:00,168
- Go fast!
- Where are we going?

1019
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:01,608
I'll tell you!

1020
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:03,675
Should I go?
- GO!

1021
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,706
You can wear it outside.

1022
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:08,775
If I leave Ernakulam, I don't
have any room to stay.

1023
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,205
No other room..

1024
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:12,174
There's a better room
right next to this one.

1025
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:13,279
Go <i>&</i> drink over there.

1026
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:14,876
Okay?
Wait!

1027
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:17,179
Isn't that my watch?
- I was checking the time earlier..

1028
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,716
What?
Earlier?

1029
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,590
I was checking time.
- Don't wear that shirt.

1030
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,194
We're going to do something else.

1031
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:24,260
Wear one of my shirts!

1032
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,697
Something else? What is it?

1033
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:28,133
Subhash, even you will be heartbroken!
You will call me then!

1034
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:29,329
Okay! I'll call you then!

1035
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:31,204
This one?

1036
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:34,908
Shall we go?

1037
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:36,905
This is decent.
Suits you.

1038
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:38,940
Just because I
grew my hair long,

1039
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:40,272
these officers,

1040
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:41,882
put me in the lock-up,

1041
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,780
and they beat me like a dog!

1042
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,615
The broke my leg as well!

1043
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:48,410
And the sole reason was
that I grew my hair long!

1044
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,389
Tell me!

1045
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:51,118
What wrong did I do?

1046
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:53,216
My body!
My freedom!

1047
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:54,420
I will grow my hair long!

1048
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:56,355
If my moustache grows,
I'll grow it long too!

1049
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:03,203
Comrades,

1050
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:05,731
my dear townsmen,

1051
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:10,971
law is not meant to disrupt
individual freedom!'

1052
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:15,139
If growing a beard or a
moustache is a crime,

1053
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,448
the number of criminals
here would keep increasing!

1054
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:23,053
Even if they arrest all the people who
have gathered here <i>&</i> put them in jail,

1055
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:26,087
none of us are going
to back out!

1056
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:28,917
You can start
constructing a new jail!

1057
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:30,158
That will be better for you!

1058
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:33,290
Such atrocities will
not be allowed here.

1059
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,360
This place is different!

1060
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:38,136
The wind that blows there,
does not blow here!

1061
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:43,175
This storm originated from the
top of a cliff in Pinarayi

1062
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:46,209
in December, 1939 at Pinarayi.

1063
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:52,315
Through this storm, we will uproot
all your masks of fake morality.

1064
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:55,412
That has been the
history of this party.

1065
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:57,090
Red Salute!

1066
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:58,313
Everyone, clap!

1067
01:01:58,314 --> 01:01:59,292
Now let's begin!

1068
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:04,791
Salutes!

1069
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,923
Comrade, these are students of
Maharaja college. This is Subhash!

1070
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:09,460
Greetings comrade!
- This is Rajesh.

1071
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:10,902
This is Paul.
- Greetings, Sir.

1073
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:25,485
'Officers, Sirs <i>&</i> Bosses,
we are also with him!'

1074
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:29,915
'We are also with him'

1075
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:34,316
'Officers, Sirs <i>&</i> Bosses,
we are also with him!'

1076
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:38,390
'We are also with him'

01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:40,355
'We will walk on the roads,

We will make have fun on the fields,

We will walk on the roads,

01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:46,898
We will have fun on the fields,

1081
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:48,965
We will get wet in the rain,

1082
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:51,011
We will go for a walk during winter,

1083
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:52,901
We will grow our beards,

1084
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:53,972
our moustaches,

1085
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,879
and grow our hair till our knees!'

1086

'That is our choice!'

1087
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:00,384
'We will do it!'

1088
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:04,117
'Should we write the hair
on our body in your name, O' Sir?'

1089
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:08,383
'Should we write the roads that our
forefathers built, in your name, O' Sir?'

1090
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:13,356
'What's wrong if saints dressed
in white swindle crores?'

1091
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:17,800
'You have us to pick on,
whenever you feel like it!'

1092
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:21,837
'That disgusting fascist
stick in your hand,

1093
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:26,311
that's not meant to suppress
ourfreedom in our land!'

1094
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:30,373
'This is our land, our
road, our garden!'

1095
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:34,818
'We know how to live here'

1096
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:38,825

'We will do it!'

'That is our choice'

1106
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:57,103
'We will do it!'

1107
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,811
Nice parotta!

1108
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:06,920
Jomy!

1109
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:08,512
You should join the
election work!

1110
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,080
To stick the posters?
- Yes!

1111
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:11,250
I will be there!

1112
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:12,918
Sure?
- Definitely!

1113
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:14,416
How is it this time?
Full panel, right?

1114
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,483
Yes. Full panel.

1115
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:18,353
Last time, 2 people filed nominations
& went missing when it was time!

1116
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,487
That won't happen this time!

1117
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:20,592
This time, I'm there, right?

1118
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:23,397
Shall we ask Rajesh to contest?

1119
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:26,236
They ripped him apart last time.

1120
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,497
Don't force him.

1121
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,303
Then who else?
- We have new kids, right?

1122
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,511
You promise, right?
- Yes!

1123
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,635
Hey! All of you should be
there for election work.

1124
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,237
We have a lot of work! Got it?

1125
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:36,216
We'll be there!

1126
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,478
You should help us actively in
sticking posters and all.

1127
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,519
Yes!

1128
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:43,678
Don't order anything more!

1129
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,090
- OK. One more parotta!
- Subhash,

1130
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,087
If you change the
history of the college,

1131
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,684
you can achieve a
position in the party!

1132
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:52,063
After 5 years, our party
will go reach another level!

1133
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:55,225
Many who have hoisted flags in
Maharaja, are central ministers now.

1134
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,429
<i>Watch out, Sun“ Chetta'.!</i>

1135
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:01,000
I will re-write the history of
Maharaja College this time.

1136
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:03,910
Come!

1137
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,478
Hey!

1138
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:07,113
Dude!

1139
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:10,311
Come! Let's go make some posters.

1140
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,477
No! Ever since they pulled our
clothes off last time, we're afraid!

1141
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:14,676
We're not coming!

1142
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:15,917
Poster'?

1143
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:17,112
You mean name-slip?

1144
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:18,990
Name-slip?
Sheesh!

1145
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:20,959
Dude, at least you remembered!

1146
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:22,350
Those guys are not coming!

1147
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:23,989
Didn't we tell everyone?

1148
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,021
We'll go! You have money
for the tickets, right? - Tickets?

1149
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:27,355
Ya! For the movie!
- Which movie?

1150
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:28,391
'Oil Bath'

1151
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:29,492
'Oil Bath?'
- Ya!

1152
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:32,027
We'll go for the movie
if you have money!

1153
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:34,129
So you haven't come to stick posters?
- My dear bro!

1154
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,132
We have to go urgently!
See you later in the night!

1155
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:40,374
Dude, can you come after the movie?

1156
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,006
No, dude! We will be tired!

1157
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:44,512
'Time is a witness'

1158
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:46,384
'History is a witness'

1159
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:49,353
'To the martyr of the battlefield'
How is it?

1160
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,389
That's nice!

1161
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:51,491
Write that!

1162
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,448
Write it in red ink!
- Dude!

1163
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,019
No one's coming to help us, dude!

1164
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,562
We'll write it ourselves.
That's better!

1165
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,360
We don't need anyone!
We'll write ourselves!

1166
01:05:58,421 --> 01:05:59,695
Did you write what I told you?

1167
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,532
Long Live the Revolution!

1168
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:15,675
Take me along, at least to stick posters.
- No, Chetta. You wait here.

1169
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:17,951
Paul, come!

1170
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:21,443
We've to stick them on pillars that
are visible while entering the campus.

1171
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,082
We'll stick them on all those pillars!

1172
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:24,584
Shall we start here?

1173
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:27,653
You apply the glue!

1174
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:33,596
Shall I stick one here?
- Of course!

1175
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:34,734
Next we will..

1176
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:35,768
Over here!

1177
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:37,003
Stick it here!

1178
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:39,372
That's it!

1179
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,263
The glue is over!

1180
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:43,365
We'll need some more!

1181
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:45,734
Didn't I ask you if you've
taken enough flour'?

1182
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:47,544
Dude, who tore
off that poster?

1183
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,548
Gosh! Who tore it?

1184
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:53,252
Who did it?

1185
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,117
The posters here are also torn!

1186
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:58,283
Who did this nonsense?

1187
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:01,122
All the posters we stuck are torn!

1188
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,495
Enough!

1189
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:04,224
I know what to do next!
Come!

1190
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:06,332
Subhash,

1191
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:09,026
I think they're planning
to mess with us.

1192
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:10,792
Shut up, dude!

1193
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:12,670
We'll get guys from
Kokkan Colony <i>&</i> Aruna.

1194
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:14,435
They will rip them apart!
Paul,

1195
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:15,641
you write it!

1196
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:30,488
Let me see who tears this!

1197
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,451
Who wrote this on the
wall <i>&</i> made it filthy?

1198
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:36,262
Wipe it off!

1199
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,354
If so, isn't that
also filthy, Chetta?

1200
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:42,097
That? Just because someone did
it long back, you'll do it?

1201
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:45,230
Let the people who wrote that wipe it
off first! After that, I'll wipe this off!

1202
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:46,466
You won't rub it off othenlvise?

1203
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,372
- That will be a problem, Chetta.
- Rub it off!

1204
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:50,165
Without wiping that off,
I won't wipe this.

1205
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:51,406
You can't wipe it off?
- No!

1206
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:52,500
Then I'll wipe it off!

1207
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:54,310
Didn't I tell you that
I won't wipe it off?

1208
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,547
Dude, enough!
- Son of a swine!

1209
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:58,050
I'll show you what I can do!

1210
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,312
Show it!

1211
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,355
Let me see what you'll do!
- Get going!

1212
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:02,688
Get lost!

1213
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:04,587
Who asked you to kick him?

1214
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:07,793
We shouldn't cause any
problems until the elections.

1215
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,591
He must've torn off
all our posters.

1216
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,393
And he's trying to mess with us?
- I know!

1217
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:13,365
Now those guys will come <i>&</i> start a fight!

1218
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:14,400
Shucks!
- Don't bother!

1219
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:20,558
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

1220
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:45,531
One minute.

1221
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,636
I'm going to ask a
question to all of you.

1222
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:51,864
You better answer
me as good kids!

1223
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,869
Who made the wall
outside filthy?

1224
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:01,813
If you say it soon,
we will leave soon.

1225
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:04,710
Or else, we'll get in
and bash up everyone!

1226
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,686
They are not saying.
Come, guys!

1227
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:09,722
What do we do?

1228
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:19,721
Was it you?

1229
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:20,666
LS if you?

1230
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,563
Or do you know who did it?

1231
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:25,771
Huh?

1232
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:27,740
It's not him!

1233
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:29,275
Then?

1234
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:31,444
I wrote it!

1235
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:33,771
Didn't I tell you?
I knew it!

1236
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:35,414
Whoever it is,

1237
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,709
enter the class only
after cleaning the wall.

1238
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:40,385
Go!

1239
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:45,791
Go, man!

1240
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:56,761
Aren't you going?

1241
01:09:58,894 --> 01:09:59,872
What?

1242
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:10,283
Study, kids!
- Thank you!

1243
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:11,317
Come!

1244
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,259
Can you give me a piece of cake?

1245
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,460
Why didn't you eat it
when I offered?

1246
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:27,967
Aren't you going to class?

1247
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:29,824
I'm not that interested in Physics.

1248
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:30,803
Got it!

1249
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:33,465
You better wipe it off
<i>&</i> go back to class.

1250
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:34,540
We'll go!

1251
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:36,664
We'll go back to class!

1252
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,975
Good for you if you wipe it.
- We don't intend to wipe it.

1253
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:43,316
Hey Subhash!

1254
01:10:44,306 --> 01:10:45,284
Subhash!

1255
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:49,555
Very nice!

1256
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:54,658
Isn't it time to wipe it off?

1257
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:57,956
We were thinking how
we should wipe it off.

1258
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,263
If you don't know how
to wipe, don't write!

1259
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,464
Enter the hostel only after
wiping off what you wrote.

1260
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,998
Their bloody literature
on the walls!

1261
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:09,869
What's the problem?
- We don't have to bother about it!

1262
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:15,681
What happened?

1263
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:22,011
Don't look at him.
- Keep quiet.

1264
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,450
Will it start anytime soon?

1265
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,388
Such a lousy bike!

1266
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:36,865
The bike will start only
if you turn the key.

1267
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:42,467
Get in only after you wipe it off!
Got it?

1268
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:43,743
Bloody!

1269
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:46,278
These guys are hell bent
on getting beaten up!

1270
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:51,407
Boss!
- Huh?

1271
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:53,415
What happened to your face?

1272
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:54,880
I just laughed once.

1273
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:56,322
What laugh?

1274
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,452
I laughed at Roopesh.

1275
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:00,826
My dear,

1276
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:03,487
Maharaja College is not
your Paragon Restaurant.

1277
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,454
You should never react!
You know?

1278
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:08,799
Jose Chetta, pack 2 food
packets for our room.

1279
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:10,503
Where are they?
- They will come!

1280
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:11,570
I'll bring it!

1281
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:12,905
Dude,

1282
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,740
we become so cheesy when
we're in love, right?

1283
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,404
While I was in love with Anu,

1284
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,771
what all did I do!

1285
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:26,616
Walking behind her, writing
her name on my notebook;

1286
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,421
Good that it's over!

1287
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:30,715
I am relieved now.

1288
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,558
Dude!
- Ya.

1289
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,324
You're still feeling
quite sad, right?

1290
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:36,960
Yes. A little bit.

1291
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:42,424
It will be gone soon.

1292
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,935
You laugh, dude!

1293
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,104
Hey!

1294
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,161
It's past 11 PM. Aren't
you going to the hostel?

1295
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:48,505
We went for a night show.

1296
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:49,842
Which movie?

1297
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:50,976
'Oil Bath'

1298
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:52,511
How is it?

1299
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,713
Watchable.

1300
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:55,614
Get back soon.

1301
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:58,113
Aren't you coming to the hostel?

1302
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,047
We will come in sometime.

1303
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:04,647
Come, dude!
- You carry on.

1304
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:24,604
- Hey, Paul!

1305
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:26,145
Come!

1306
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:27,446
What is it?

1307
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:31,584
Dude,

1308
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:35,587
have you felt a 70's mood in this
cam pus at any point of time?

1309
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:38,922
But I wasn't even
born during the 70's.

1310
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:43,426
It was during the 70's
that SFY was founded here.

1311
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,897
Comrade Kochaniyan!

1312
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:48,998
The romance back in those
times was glorious!

1313
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,132
The time of emergency,

1314
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:53,934
romancing while
hiding from others;

1315
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:56,505
People would die for
love and revolution!

1316
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,769
Who is this Kochaniyan?

1317
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:00,946
Kochaniyan,

1318
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:02,945
was the Che Guevara
of this college.

1319
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:06,619
Che Guevara was also like you.
Completely irresponsible.

1320
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:11,480
He underwent a transformation
when he reached Mexico.

1321
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:15,559
Have you ever walked
alone in this campus?

1322
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:16,729
No.

1323
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:18,759
Try doing that once in a while.

1324
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:22,228
You would feel that Che
Guevara <i>&</i> Kochaniyan,

1325
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:25,027
are still around us over here.

1326
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,915
Dude, they are coming to hit us!
Run!

1327
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:36,949
What?

1328
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:38,745
Run, Paul! Run!

1329
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:42,482
Who are they?
- Just keep running!

1330
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:48,616
Dude, there are people
coming from there!

1331
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:49,595
Run!

1332
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:51,997
Stop!

1333
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:56,569
Catch them!

1334
01:14:58,861 --> 01:14:59,839
Stop!

01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:11,999
Hey, come here!

1338
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,035
He will be here!

1340
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:22,043
They should be somewhere here.
- Come!

1341
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:23,352
We should finish them today!

1352
01:18:58,767 --> 01:18:59,939
My dear student friends,

1353
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:03,979
Today, freedom has been denied
right in front of our eyes.

1354
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:06,373
In this campus ruled by KSQ,

1355
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:07,978
goondaism has become the norm.

1356
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:11,387
Just because we wrote a thought
on the wall yesterday,

1357
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:14,823
10 of them thrashed both
of us up like dogs!

1358
01:19:15,217 --> 01:19:17,197
You should understand one thing.
This is a campus.

1359
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:20,762
Unions have been formed here,
to spread good ideologies!

1360
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,868
The same blood that runs in
your veins, runs in ours too.

1361
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:25,332
What are you staring at?

1362
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:26,394
WHAT?

1363
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:29,874
And if that blood has been shed here today,
we will fight back strongly against it!

1364
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:33,069
One minute.
I'll be right back.

1365
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:38,110
Why did he slap you?
- Just because I looked at him.

1366
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:39,746
Because you looked?

1367
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:40,786
Dude,

1368
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:42,386
Do you want to get back at him?
- Yes!

1369
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:44,890
Right now?
- Right now!

1370
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:48,988

01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:43,438
Hey! Beat them up!

1412
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:48,341
Didn't you hear a
sound from somewhere?

1413
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:50,644
No! From where? I didn't hear.
- I heard it, dude!

1414
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:51,974
I didn't hear it!

1415
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:53,674
What sound?
- I heard it!

1416
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:55,416
You come here.

1417
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:57,616
I heard a sound, dude.
- What sound?

1418
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:12,932
Jomy!
- Who is it at this time?

1419
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:13,972
Hey!

1420
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:15,632
Open the door! It's me!

1421
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:20,345
Come!

1422
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:22,036
Dude,

1423
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:23,516
Are you all right?
- I'm all right!

1424
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:25,017
I'm okay.

1425
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:26,342
Where is Krish nan?

1426
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:27,614
Wasn't he with you?

1427
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:29,246
Not with me. He ran
somewhere else!

1428
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:31,412
What all was he doing?

1429
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:33,359
Breaking the flag and all!
He must have escaped!

1430
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:35,387
Whatever!
Hope he's safe!

1431
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:37,928
He must have escaped, right?
- Definitely!

1432
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:40,132
They are really furious.

1433
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:47,272
Subhash!

1434
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:51,075
Hey, it's me!
Open the door!

1435
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:53,400
The situation outside is really bad.

1436
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:54,379
Come with me!

1437
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:57,141
Hey kids! You better get
going from here quickly!

1438
01:22:57,238 --> 01:22:59,684
They have planned to
kill you before sunrise!

1439
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:01,415
What will you do now?

1440
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:03,684
Let them kill us
if they want to!

1441
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:06,156
We can't be completely
destroyed like that.

1442
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:09,283
For an ideology that we believe in,

1443
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:11,230
we might have go into hiding.

1444
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:14,197
That is to hit back
much more strongly!

1445
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:16,428
I didn't say this.

1446
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:18,529
Che Guevara said this.

1447
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:19,663
Where will we go?

1448
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:20,706
Somewhere!

1449
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:22,400
But where will you go
during this night?

1450
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:24,771
Hey blacky, they are
looking for you especially!

1451
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:26,273
But I didn't do anything!

1452
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:28,211
Where's my bag?
- Pack all your stuff quickly!

1453
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:30,449
Come!

1454
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:35,614
Get going quickly!

1455
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:36,688
Come!

1456
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:44,229
You can kill me!

1457
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:45,628
But you cannot defeat me!

1458
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:48,096
Why are you saying this to me?
Tell it to them!

1459
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:49,766
You want to scare me or what?

1460
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:53,794
Where are you guys going,
with these bags and all?

1461
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:55,433
We are staying away
for the time being.

1462
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:56,663
At Jomy's place.

1463
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:58,632
Subhash, if it's a fight,
you have to fight them!

1464
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:00,112
Running away is not a good idea.

1465
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:01,613
<i>Raflesh Chem,</i>

1466
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,281
we are not hiding
because we're scared.

1467
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:06,473
But to bounce back
even more strongly!

1468
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:07,452
We will be back!

1469
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:25,828
Chechi!
(Elder Sister)

1470
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:30,405
This is my eldest sister.
Jessy Chechi.

1471
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:31,808
This is my second sister.

1472
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:33,211
Jimsy Chechi.

1473
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:34,835
This is my third sister.

1474
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:36,136
Jasmine Chechi.

1475
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:37,671
This is my fourth sister.

1476
01:24:37,672 --> 01:24:38,650
<i>Juicy Chechi.</i>

1477
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,308
This is a Chechi
from the next house.

1478
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:42,344
Jameela Chechi.

1479
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:46,313
Jomy.

1480
01:24:46,314 --> 01:24:48,453
Are these your sisters who
are of marriage-able age?

1481
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:50,291
I was born after all of them.

1482
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:52,092
As soon as he saw my
face, my dad died!

1483
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:53,131
Poor thing!

1484
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:56,301
And the entire responsibility
of this house came upon me!

1485
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,638
Paul,

1486
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:02,698
I'm afraid if we will have to take up
the responsibility of this family now!

1487
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:03,867
You can lie down here, right?

1488
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:05,677
Ya. It's fine.

1489
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,302
Are there mosquitoes?
- Yes.

1490
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:08,836
Do you have a mosquito coil?

1491
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:09,815
No.

1492
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:11,116
Very nice!

1493
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:15,320
Don't you want the blanket?
- Yes.

1494
01:25:17,812 --> 01:25:18,790
<i>Hey JOHN'-!</i>

1495
01:25:20,548 --> 01:25:22,789
None of your sisters are married?

1496
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:26,789
I have to finish studies,
get a job, earn money

1497
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:28,722
and get them married one by one.

1498
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:30,703
All of them are living
with that hope!

1499
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:34,874
If that's the case, you will have
to earn quite a lot of money, Jomy.

1500
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:37,275
True!

1501
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:42,202
Did you know? They've come here
after breaking the flag in college!

1502
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:43,181
Where are they?

1503
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:46,151
If they have escaped, tell them that
they needn't come back to college!

1504
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:48,244
We will rip them apart!

1505
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:50,555
Come!

1506
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:54,217
They've left!
We're safe!

1507
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:55,560
Hey!

1508
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:57,457
I called you only!

1509
01:25:57,552 --> 01:25:59,759
You're threatening us
early in the morning?

1510
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:01,388
We have tough men here as well!

1511
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:02,367
Oh my God!

1512
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:05,398
Jomy, come down!

1513
01:26:05,593 --> 01:26:07,231
Slice that swine to chops!

1514
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:12,140
Oh God! They were leaving
and she called them back!

1515
01:26:17,772 --> 01:26:19,274
Chop that pig into pieces!

1516
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:25,423
Who wants to hit us?

1517
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,426
If you hit us, you
better kill us before leaving.

1518
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:29,462
Or I'll come to your houses
& chop you into pieces!

1519
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:30,795
Get lost!

1520
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:33,265
Get lost!

1521
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:36,300
- This is not going to stop here!

1522
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:38,928
Can't you go after
Mother Mary's festival?

1523
01:26:38,993 --> 01:26:40,973
Ya right! Attending a
festival in between all this?

1524
01:26:41,329 --> 01:26:43,707
Where will you go
during this midnight?

1525
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:44,935
Where are we going?

1526
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:46,809
To North Kerala.

1527
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:49,373
There's a place where nobody
will come looking for us,

1528
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:51,280
and where we don't have
to be scared of anyone!

1529
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:52,612
The land of warriors!

1530
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,187
Kannun

1531
01:26:55,276 --> 01:26:56,276
Let's

1532
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:57,654
Bye!

1533
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:02,860
Sisters, I'm leaving!

1534
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:04,954
Make the sign of the
cross <i>&</i> go to sleep!

1535
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:08,799
There won't be any troubles here
like you had at Jomy's place.

1536
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,528
This place is different!

1537
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:12,633
Even though it's
greenery on the outside,

1538
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:13,994
deep inside, it is red!

1539
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:14,995
This is Kannur!

1540
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:16,997
<i>My house is dose by, Raflesh Chem.
Thafiparamba.</i>

1541
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:19,410
- And my dad was transferred from here.
- I know that.

1542
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,706
So there's no one here.

1543
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:24,573
So we are neighbours,
right Rajesh Chetta?

1544
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:26,478
From the same town!

1545
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:31,812
This house is really old,
isn't it, Rajesh Chetta?

1546
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:33,019
It's my grandmother's house.

1547
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:38,752
Is this what they
call 'Theyyam'?

1548
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:40,255
'Parasshinikkadavu Muthappan'

1549
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:41,527
The God of the people of Kannur.

1550
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:44,661
Then who is this?

1551
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:51,807
Ayillyath Kuttiari Gopalan

1552
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:53,878
Another God of the
people of Kannur.

1553
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:57,871
This fool doesn't know who AKG is?
He should be slapped!

1554
01:27:57,872 --> 01:27:58,976
You don't know AKG?

1555
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,340
I haven't seen him.

1556
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:01,877
But I have only heard about him.
That's why!

1557
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:06,890
Mom, these are my
juniors from college.

1558
01:28:07,415 --> 01:28:08,393
This is Paul.

1559
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:10,557
This is Subhash <i>&</i> this is Jomy.

1560
01:28:10,885 --> 01:28:12,694
Get some tea, mom.
Some snacks as well!

1561
01:28:12,854 --> 01:28:13,832
Okay!

1562
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:15,890
By the way, since
we broke the flag,

1563
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:17,867
can we go back to
college to get our TCs?

1564
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:19,294
Why do you want a TC?

1565
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:21,501
No one's going to get a TC.

1566
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:23,997
If you're so scared, why did
you go to break the flag?

1567
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:25,409
But I didn't break it!

1568
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:27,742
Then why did you come here with
them if you haven't done it?

1569
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:28,813
Can't you go back?

1570
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:31,510
If led from my town
and came to Kannur.

1571
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:34,451
Now if I say that I didn't break
the flag, will people believe me?

1572
01:28:35,877 --> 01:28:38,357
I didn't break the flag!
I can't get a TC.

1573
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:39,846
That's not the
problem right now!

1574
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:41,690
We must go back to campus
for the elections.

1575
01:28:41,749 --> 01:28:43,490
Since the university has
declared elections,

1576
01:28:43,584 --> 01:28:45,586
they won't touch you
until it's over.

1577
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,455
But didn't you say that you got
thulped after the elections,

1578
01:28:48,456 --> 01:28:49,856
for filing a nomination last year?

1579
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:52,337
They took care of me royally
until the elections were over.

1580
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:53,405
I was really pampered!

1581
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:54,971
But as soon as the
election was over,

1582
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:57,735
they beat me up. And I don't
even remember how I escaped!

1583
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,470

It's me, Krishnan.

Krishnan, why didn't
you come here?

1589
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:39,345
I came to my hometown because of
the issue of breaking the flag.

1590
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,983
Why did you escape from college?

1591

I came here this morning
when Subhash called me.

1592

And I didn't want to get
killed by staying there.

Aren't you coming?

No Rajesh Chetta.
I'm not coming to Kannur.

I'm at my hometown, and I'm part

Okay! Go ahead!

1598

Strike?

1603
01:30:04,799 --> 01:30:06,676
We have to contest the
elections, right? - Who is it?

1604
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:08,135
It's Krishnan! You want to talk?

1605
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:09,672
He must be hiding in
his house, right?

1606
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:12,115
I knew this when I saw him breaking
that flag! That he'll escape!

No dude. He's taking part
in some strike there.

Dude, are you coming to
bathe in the pond?

1609
01:30:15,877 --> 01:30:18,016
- Dude, pass the phone to Paul.

They are going to bathe
in the pond, dude.

what I'm saying is that,

1617
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:37,032
you should be on the
panel this time.

1618
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:38,610
All of us should contest.

1619
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:40,444
Let my case be.

1620
01:30:40,535 --> 01:30:42,845
We have to figure out who the
chairman candidate is, first.

1621
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,506
What's the confusion in that?

1622
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:46,877
Paul should be the candidate
for the Chairman post.

1623
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:48,787
Paul?

1624
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:51,044
Paul is a popular figure
among the students now.

1625
01:30:51,045 --> 01:30:52,183
By breaking the flag.

1626
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:55,248
But he doesn't have any idea
how the party functions!

1627
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:57,024
We'll get the votes of
unbiased students,

01:30:57,084 --> 01:30:59,530
only when a person without
a party background contests.

And you will be General Secretary.

01:37:59,306 --> 01:38:03,152
even if anyone swears at our parents,
we have to stay quiet <i>&</i> smile!

1756
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:05,615
Shiyaz Ikka, I want to say something!

1757
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:07,989
What? If it's about Shikandi, no!
- This is a..

1758
01:38:08,515 --> 01:38:10,617
I have a doubt if
this is a group conspiracy!

1759
01:38:10,618 --> 01:38:11,596
My God!

1760
01:38:13,187 --> 01:38:18,227
Have a lot of hopes on this year's
elections at Maharaja College.

1761
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:21,333
This time, we are contesting for
the full panel after many years.

1762
01:38:21,662 --> 01:38:25,974
Red revolutionary waves are going to hit
strongly against KSQ for the first time!

1763
01:38:26,133 --> 01:38:28,636
That too, under the leadership
of comrade Subhash.

1764
01:38:28,969 --> 01:38:30,539
Revolutionary salutes
to all of you!

1765
01:38:30,704 --> 01:38:34,207
Now I invite the district
secretary to speak a few words.

1766
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:36,154
Comrade, please.

1767
01:38:39,346 --> 01:38:40,324
Comrades,

1768
01:38:41,548 --> 01:38:44,893
KSQ is ruling over the
Maharaja College cam pus

1769
01:38:44,952 --> 01:38:47,933
through violence and goondaism.

1770
01:38:48,622 --> 01:38:50,523
KSQ has been winning the
elections for years,

1771
01:38:50,524 --> 01:38:52,504
without any opposition,

1772
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:56,073
and by beating up anyone
who stood against them.

1773
01:38:57,231 --> 01:39:01,680
So when I see the SFY comrades who have
come forward to change this status quo,

1774
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:04,007
I truly feel very proud!

1775
01:39:05,005 --> 01:39:10,182
I promise you that you will have
all the support from our party.

1776
01:39:10,678 --> 01:39:12,919
My revolutionary salutes to you!

1777
01:39:13,747 --> 01:39:14,725
Red Salute!

1778
01:39:15,249 --> 01:39:16,922
We should be concentrating
on our campaign.

1779
01:39:17,017 --> 01:39:18,655
They are higher in number,
and have good funds as well!

1780
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:21,495
We should show that we're more
powerful than them if we unite.

1781
01:39:22,156 --> 01:39:23,134
Hey Subhash!

1782
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:24,368
Just a minute.

1783
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:26,063
You guys carry on.

1784
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:28,231
I'll come.
- OK. See you in the hostel.

1785
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:29,607
<i>Sun“ Chetta,</i>

1786
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:30,970
you'll come quickly, right?

1787
01:39:40,407 --> 01:39:41,408
Did they leave?
- Yes.

1788
01:39:43,544 --> 01:39:45,023
So? Will you win the elections?

1789
01:39:45,546 --> 01:39:46,524
We will win!

1790
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:47,680
We should win.

1791
01:39:47,681 --> 01:39:48,682
What if you don't win?

1792
01:39:50,117 --> 01:39:52,222
If we lose, none of us will
step inside the campus.

1793
01:39:52,419 --> 01:39:54,399
You know what will happen
if you lose, right?

1794
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:57,536
SFY would never step
inside Maharaja College.

1795
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:00,069
That's only if we lose, right?

1796
01:40:01,128 --> 01:40:03,768
I'm going to tell you a secret
I heard from the party.

1797
01:40:04,565 --> 01:40:06,101
What the party is
saying is that,

1798
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:08,703
if our party needs to have a
strong foundation in your college,

1799
01:40:09,269 --> 01:40:11,010
we need a martyr for that.

1800
01:40:11,472 --> 01:40:13,213
What did you say?
I didn't get you.

1801
01:40:14,641 --> 01:40:15,619
Dude,

1802
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:17,780
The party is saying that,

1803
01:40:18,445 --> 01:40:20,118
Paul should be that martyr.

1804
01:40:20,214 --> 01:40:21,781
What are you saying?
- Don't shout!

1805
01:40:21,782 --> 01:40:23,227
If not Paul, they will kill you!

1806
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:25,354
If I try to save you
both, I will be killed!

1807
01:40:27,588 --> 01:40:29,789
We will have to obey
the party's orders!

1808
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:31,599
It's for us to win
the election, right?

1809
01:40:31,658 --> 01:40:32,636
Think about it.

1810
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:37,099
<i>I'll just..
I..</i>

1811
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:39,436
I'll just be back.

1812
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:44,867
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

1813
01:40:52,112 --> 01:40:53,489
When you got down to fight,

1814
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:55,117
instead of calling
your mother's name,

1815
01:40:55,182 --> 01:40:56,682
you said 'Long Live
the Revolution',

1816
01:40:56,683 --> 01:40:58,094
a thousand salutes to you!

1817
01:40:58,152 --> 01:41:00,359
But if I get beaten, I'll
call out for my mommy! I swear!

1818
01:41:00,421 --> 01:41:02,055
You don't have to come.
That's better!

1819
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:03,228
I have another idea.

1820
01:41:03,323 --> 01:41:06,634
Shall we clean up
this entire college?

1821
01:41:07,327 --> 01:41:08,305
25 acres?

1822
01:41:08,362 --> 01:41:09,500
It will take one year.

1823
01:41:09,797 --> 01:41:11,276
What about its half?

1824
01:41:11,331 --> 01:41:13,709
We'll clean the entire drainage system.
- That'll be stinky!

1825
01:41:15,235 --> 01:41:16,805
The stink of cleaning the
drainage is better than

1826
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:18,508
the stink
of losing the election.

1827
01:41:18,572 --> 01:41:19,642
That's correct!

1828
01:41:20,174 --> 01:41:21,619
Write that other line.

1829
01:41:23,811 --> 01:41:24,811
Sanjay.

1830
01:41:24,812 --> 01:41:25,790
See who it is.

1831
01:41:27,681 --> 01:41:28,682
Will it be them?

1832
01:41:34,354 --> 01:41:35,332
Subhash,

1833
01:41:35,456 --> 01:41:37,290
I have prepared an
amazing speech.

1834
01:41:37,291 --> 01:41:39,292
You don't know the effect
of my speech, right?

1835
01:41:39,293 --> 01:41:41,637
While I was studying for
pre-degree in Payyannur College,

1836
01:41:41,695 --> 01:41:43,675
the union there was
under KSQ's rule!

1837
01:41:44,164 --> 01:41:45,698
To conquer the union there,

1838
01:41:45,699 --> 01:41:47,838
I went to every class and
gave an awesome speech.

1839
01:41:48,702 --> 01:41:50,841
Why aren't you excited
after I told you so much?

1840
01:41:51,205 --> 01:41:53,242
Did that Roopesh do
something on your way back?

1841
01:41:55,375 --> 01:41:56,353
Hey!

1842
01:41:56,577 --> 01:41:57,555
No!

1843
01:41:58,345 --> 01:41:59,712
Don't be tensed about
the elections.

1844
01:41:59,713 --> 01:42:01,283
We will definitely win!

1845
01:42:05,552 --> 01:42:06,530
Check who it is!

1846
01:42:06,587 --> 01:42:07,565
It's for you.

1847
01:42:07,688 --> 01:42:09,463
For me?
- Ya. For you! Go!

1848
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:11,426
Who's going to call me now?

1849
01:42:11,725 --> 01:42:13,432
They won't even let
me brag about myself.

1850
01:42:15,496 --> 01:42:16,662
His speech!

1851
01:42:16,663 --> 01:42:17,767
No need for that!

1852
01:42:17,865 --> 01:42:20,675
Ya right! Payyannur College!
It's all bullshit!

1853
01:42:20,834 --> 01:42:23,838
Who will vote for this face which
looks like numerals are written on it?

1854
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:27,642
For him, some folk song or
folk dance would be best!

1855
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:30,782
Subhash, the call is for you.

1856
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:38,129
Do you know?

1857
01:42:38,252 --> 01:42:39,424
Elocution is an art form!

1858
01:42:39,486 --> 01:42:40,931
What's the point in
saying that to you?

1859
01:42:41,889 --> 01:42:45,391
But my opinion is that folk songs would
be better for you than a speech.

1860
01:42:45,392 --> 01:42:47,770
No need of any folk song, man!
I don't have the mood for that.

1861
01:42:51,932 --> 01:42:53,570
Hey Paul, shall I recite a poem?

1862
01:42:56,203 --> 01:42:58,204
'March forward bravely,

1863
01:42:58,205 --> 01:43:01,778
with the future generations
as your witnesses'

1864
01:43:02,476 --> 01:43:08,552
'Fly the red flag in your hand
high in the sky, and shout'

1865
01:43:08,815 --> 01:43:14,697
'Fly the red flag in your hand
high in the sky, and shout'

1866
01:43:14,922 --> 01:43:17,698
'Long Live the Revolution!'

1867
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:21,428
'Long Live the Revolution!'

1868
01:43:25,432 --> 01:43:26,843
You should maintain peace.

1869
01:43:28,435 --> 01:43:32,178
Among the nominations for
the Chairman's position,

1870
01:43:32,673 --> 01:43:34,778
firstly, Roopesh.
Electoral 610.

1871
01:43:35,008 --> 01:43:38,319
The are 2 criminal cases filed against
Roopesh at central police station.

1872
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:44,224
He is not eligible to contest the
election while these cases are in court!

1873
01:43:44,284 --> 01:43:45,284
Hey!

1874
01:43:45,285 --> 01:43:47,420
Only if it's proved that it's
a criminal case, it's valid!

1875
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:48,695
That's why the case is in court!

1876
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:51,235
So he agreed that there
are cases against him!

1877
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:52,992
That's why it is being
fought in court.

1878
01:43:52,993 --> 01:43:54,472
You prove it first!

1879
01:43:54,861 --> 01:43:56,238
Subhash, stop it!

1880
01:43:57,497 --> 01:43:58,475
ROOpesh!

1881
01:43:58,565 --> 01:43:59,543
Let's see.

1882
01:43:59,866 --> 01:44:00,844
Sir, keep this.

1883
01:44:03,003 --> 01:44:04,983
Electoral number 608,

1884
01:44:05,939 --> 01:44:06,917
Paul Varghese.

1885
01:44:08,342 --> 01:44:09,342
Sir,

1886
01:44:09,343 --> 01:44:11,380
I want to check his nomination.

1887
01:44:11,712 --> 01:44:13,282
Give it, Sir. We want to check it.

1888
01:44:13,347 --> 01:44:14,690
I can't hand over the nomination.

1889
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:16,625
But you can show it, right?
- Look!

1890
01:44:16,683 --> 01:44:17,683
Sir,

1891
01:44:17,684 --> 01:44:18,822
Sir, check his name.

1892
01:44:18,919 --> 01:44:21,365
See what his fathefs name is.
- Paul Varghese.

1893
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:23,426
But who is this Paul Urghese?

1894
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:25,024
Tell me the truth!
- We won't allow this!

1895
01:44:25,025 --> 01:44:27,437
We can't change our
father's name like him.

1896
01:44:27,494 --> 01:44:29,997
If there's a spelling mistake, the
nomination cannot be accepted.

1897
01:44:30,330 --> 01:44:32,970
You will have to withdraw it!
- I didn't make this rule!

1898
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,706
Don't say anything!
Just get lost from here!

1899
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:38,249
One minute!

1900
01:44:38,305 --> 01:44:39,978
Don't bring up such silly
matters, Monappan!

1901
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:41,407
Don't shout!

1902
01:44:41,408 --> 01:44:42,887
Sir, this cannot be accepted.

1903
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:45,044
This already has a
spelling mistake.

1904
01:44:45,045 --> 01:44:46,718
This nomination must be rejected!

1905
01:44:47,414 --> 01:44:48,449
What is it, Roopesh?

1906
01:44:48,515 --> 01:44:51,860
Pointing out spelling mistakes and
punctuations like nursery kids?

1907
01:44:54,588 --> 01:44:55,965
Are you scared to
contest against us?

1908
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:57,562
Should we back off?

1909
01:44:57,991 --> 01:44:58,969
No!

1910
01:44:59,326 --> 01:45:00,304
You contest!

1911
01:45:01,995 --> 01:45:02,973
Do whatever!

1912
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:04,275
Move!

1913
01:45:04,731 --> 01:45:06,369
It's because you
supported him, Sir.

1914
01:45:07,734 --> 01:45:09,270
Sir, read the next one.

1915
01:45:15,842 --> 01:45:16,820
Ajayan Chetta,

1916
01:45:17,044 --> 01:45:20,082
this whole portion
should be changed.

1917
01:45:20,414 --> 01:45:22,052
This looks like a navy cut.

1918
01:45:22,616 --> 01:45:23,594
Ajayan Chetta,

1919
01:45:24,117 --> 01:45:25,289
that's not good enough.

1920
01:45:25,585 --> 01:45:26,563
A little..

1921
01:45:28,588 --> 01:45:29,566
No. It's okay.

1922
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:30,862
Continue drawing.
It's correct!

1923
01:45:30,991 --> 01:45:31,969
Keep drawing.

1924
01:45:33,093 --> 01:45:34,071
Jomy,
- Yes.

1925
01:45:34,594 --> 01:45:35,664
Come here.
- Tell me.

1926
01:45:36,763 --> 01:45:38,470
Take this candidate list of ours

1927
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:40,402
to the ladies hostel,

1928
01:45:40,767 --> 01:45:42,110
and get 200 copies written.

1929
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:43,508
Or else, make it 300.

1930
01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:47,008
Our candidates' names should be
registered in the minds of girls first.

1931
01:45:47,074 --> 01:45:48,883
Is it? Then I'll get 400 copies written!

1932
01:45:48,942 --> 01:45:50,615
Wait <i>&</i> watch!
- Then make it 500.

1933
01:45:50,911 --> 01:45:51,889
Subhash,

1934
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:54,059
drawing our own pictures like this,

1935
01:45:54,114 --> 01:45:55,752
is not part of our
political culture.

1936
01:45:55,816 --> 01:45:57,817
We should earn our places
in the hearts of students,

1937
01:45:57,818 --> 01:45:59,151
by giving speeches
<i>&</i> working for it!

1938
01:45:59,152 --> 01:46:00,756
This is a right wing
culture, Subhash.

1939
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:01,999
<i>Raflesh Chem,</i>

1940
01:46:02,122 --> 01:46:04,102
some right wing culture
is necessary here.

1941
01:46:04,458 --> 01:46:06,495
Whatever you say, I
cannot agree to this.

1942
01:46:09,696 --> 01:46:10,674
<i>Raflesh Chem,</i>

1943
01:46:12,532 --> 01:46:14,034
this is not like campaigning outside.

1944
01:46:14,534 --> 01:46:16,411
It's a game we have to
play inside this campus!

1945
01:46:16,503 --> 01:46:18,346
A game we're playing to win!

1946
01:46:18,905 --> 01:46:21,146
If they keep 4 boards,
we should keep 8 boards.

1947
01:46:21,675 --> 01:46:23,916
Paul's face should be
all over the cam pus!

1948
01:46:24,478 --> 01:46:26,617
Only SFY should be in
the minds of everyone.

1949
01:46:26,747 --> 01:46:28,158
Only then, we can win this election.

1950
01:46:29,116 --> 01:46:30,459
We're just keeping a picture.

1951
01:46:30,684 --> 01:46:32,391
We're not changing
our ideologies!

1952
01:46:37,591 --> 01:46:40,435
Where can we keep
this, Rajesh Chetta?

1953
01:46:40,961 --> 01:46:43,729
It's good if we keep one at centre
circle, so that everyone can see.

1954
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:45,767
We should keep boards wherever
we can get visibility!

1955
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:47,435
The front gate of the cam pus,

1956
01:46:47,501 --> 01:46:48,741
in front of the library,

1957
01:46:49,069 --> 01:46:51,170
the angel pond in the centre
of the centre circle;

1958
01:46:51,171 --> 01:46:53,151
and if we keep one in
front of zoology lab,

1959
01:46:53,206 --> 01:46:55,447
it will get a proper view
from the ladies' hostel.

1960
01:46:55,809 --> 01:46:58,077
And you know the staircase
at the silent verandah,

1961
01:46:58,078 --> 01:46:59,648
that's where all the
couples hang out.

1962
01:46:59,713 --> 01:47:00,691
Don't forget that.

1963
01:47:00,747 --> 01:47:02,090
Our rain tree, strike tree,

1964
01:47:02,616 --> 01:47:03,686
the grandma tree,

1965
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:05,918
and everyone who bunks class
would be at the canteen.

1966
01:47:05,919 --> 01:47:07,159
So keep one at the canteen too.

1967
01:47:07,454 --> 01:47:10,162
So we should keep boards
wherever there is visibility!

1968
01:47:10,524 --> 01:47:12,128
Wherever we keep it,
they will tear it off!

1969
01:47:13,593 --> 01:47:15,004
If they tear it, we
will keep it again!

1970
01:47:15,061 --> 01:47:16,938
<i>Mayan Chetta, draw
some extra boards'.!</i>

1971
01:47:19,866 --> 01:47:20,867
Not just boards;

1972
01:47:21,168 --> 01:47:24,581
pamphlets, leaflets; everything that the
students receive, should have our names!

1973
01:47:24,638 --> 01:47:25,616
And our faces!

1974
01:47:31,611 --> 01:47:33,488
Until now it was their
dictatorship, right?

1975
01:47:34,214 --> 01:47:35,488
All are fed up!

1976
01:47:35,682 --> 01:47:37,161
A change is necessary.

1977
01:47:44,057 --> 01:47:45,035
Vote for change!

1978
01:47:46,726 --> 01:47:48,433
That's the idea we
should project!

1979
01:47:49,896 --> 01:47:51,239
That should be our slogan!

1980
01:47:52,632 --> 01:47:53,702
Vote for change!

1981
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:59,301
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

1982
01:48:10,917 --> 01:48:13,719
In our education field, which is
possessed by the ghost of Mekkala,

1983
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,893
the waves of change
that were built!

1984
01:48:16,656 --> 01:48:18,924
It is time for us to open our
third eyes and be cautious,

1985
01:48:18,925 --> 01:48:21,531
against the move by the Government
to destroy us with violence.

1986
01:48:21,595 --> 01:48:23,040
Through their
Thugluq-Ian reforms!

1987
01:48:35,942 --> 01:48:36,920
Excuse me!

1988
01:48:36,977 --> 01:48:40,584
Can you tell me what is KSQ's stand
on private educational institutions?

1989
01:48:42,015 --> 01:48:45,017
If we surrender private professional
education to businessmen,

1990
01:48:45,018 --> 01:48:48,295
we won't let the health minister
<i>&</i> education minister to step outside!

1991
01:48:49,756 --> 01:48:50,928
Did you study anything?

1992
01:48:55,228 --> 01:48:56,206
Paul!

1993
01:48:56,796 --> 01:48:58,104
We didn't meet after that day!

1994
01:48:58,164 --> 01:49:00,075
So you decided to get beaten up?
- What?

1995
01:49:00,133 --> 01:49:01,874
I didn't get you!
- You're contesting the election, right?

1996
01:49:01,935 --> 01:49:03,642
Yes.
- Don't you want my vote?

1997
01:49:04,304 --> 01:49:07,046
I don't want to waste time by asking
for a vote which I won't get.

1998
01:49:07,307 --> 01:49:08,945
You're sure that you
won't get my vote?

1999
01:49:09,309 --> 01:49:11,311
The voters can change
their mind any time!

2000
01:49:11,778 --> 01:49:14,190
I don't want the vote of people
who keep changing their minds!

2001
01:49:15,181 --> 01:49:16,785
What's your favourite
colour now?

2002
01:49:17,284 --> 01:49:18,262
Red!

2003
01:49:18,351 --> 01:49:20,152
Huh? It was violet
earlier, right?

2004
01:49:20,153 --> 01:49:21,131
It was violet.

2005
01:49:21,821 --> 01:49:22,856
But now it's red.

2006
01:49:36,303 --> 01:49:40,615
The same movement which the National Party
protected from the approaching storm!

2007
01:49:41,675 --> 01:49:44,810
Can you tell me your opinion
on Neo colonialist media?

2008
01:49:44,811 --> 01:49:46,017
- He's trapped again!

2009
01:49:47,147 --> 01:49:49,982
Since the election behavioural
rule still exists,

2010
01:49:49,983 --> 01:49:51,894
I am not answering this
question right now.

2011
01:49:53,186 --> 01:49:55,689
After the election, KSQ
will respond to this question!

2012
01:49:57,791 --> 01:49:59,998
And the answer for you.
I'll give it to you right now!

2013
01:50:01,828 --> 01:50:02,863
For me?
- Come!

2014
01:50:04,297 --> 01:50:05,275
Come!

2015
01:50:07,167 --> 01:50:10,148
There's a new addition to Thugluq-Ian
reforms. I'll show you what that is.

2016
01:50:12,072 --> 01:50:13,710
I'll tell you something!

2017
01:50:14,941 --> 01:50:15,919
That is,

2018
01:50:16,209 --> 01:50:17,813
don't take it personally!

2019
01:50:18,378 --> 01:50:22,019
Just ask the question
we told you to ask!

2020
01:50:22,082 --> 01:50:24,028
Don't try to contribute more!
Got it?

2021
01:50:24,718 --> 01:50:26,819
Dude, next is zoology class.

2022
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:28,053
It was out of enthusiasm!

2023
01:50:28,054 --> 01:50:30,864
Why should you have the
enthusiasm that I don't have? Scoundrel!

2024
01:50:32,759 --> 01:50:34,363
Are there losers like
him over there as well?

2025
01:50:34,628 --> 01:50:36,335
There won't be losers
like him anywhere else!

2026
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:39,367
Shut up! We have just one board.
- This place will get a proper view.

2027
01:50:39,766 --> 01:50:40,744
Should we keep it here?

2028
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:43,280
Turn it this side. So that people
coming from there can also see.

2029
01:50:43,336 --> 01:50:44,747
Okay. I'll keep it on the tree.

2030
01:50:44,804 --> 01:50:46,147
Don't tie that one.
Tie this one.

2031
01:50:47,207 --> 01:50:49,778
Why are you keeping your photo here?
Did you go missing?

2032
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:51,210
Take it off!

2033
01:50:51,211 --> 01:50:53,191
As if this college belongs to your dad!
Get lost!

2034
01:50:53,246 --> 01:50:55,692
Rajesh, we booked this tree!

2035
01:50:56,082 --> 01:50:57,789
Yes! We booked this tree!

2036
01:50:57,884 --> 01:50:59,761
Then you should write your name on it!

2037
01:50:59,819 --> 01:51:02,087
You'll shit your pants if we
start hitting you guys again!

2038
01:51:02,088 --> 01:51:04,159
Subhash, you better
take this off!

2039
01:51:04,324 --> 01:51:05,658
We'll shift it.

2040
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:07,798
Subhash, we'll forget that
this is election time!

2041
01:51:07,927 --> 01:51:09,461
Take it down!

2042
01:51:09,462 --> 01:51:11,930
Subhash, how can we shift it
because they're saying so?

2043
01:51:11,931 --> 01:51:12,909
Shift it!

2044
01:51:12,966 --> 01:51:14,070
We have to take stand!

2045
01:51:14,167 --> 01:51:15,874
What are you staring at?
Get lost!

2046
01:51:15,935 --> 01:51:18,337
I told Roopesh long back itself
that we should kill these guys!

2047
01:51:18,338 --> 01:51:19,942
We'll keep it somewhere else.

2048
01:51:20,907 --> 01:51:23,080
I will pop his eyes out!

2049
01:51:25,111 --> 01:51:27,079
We should keep one
under the strike tree. Come!

2050
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:28,058
Keep it here!

2051
01:51:29,082 --> 01:51:30,288
Dude, turn it this side.

2052
01:51:31,217 --> 01:51:32,662
Turn it! Come on!

2053
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:42,106
Keep it in a way that
it's seen from the front!

2054
01:51:42,162 --> 01:51:44,768
Turn it a little more. Only then
it will be seen while entering.

2055
01:51:44,831 --> 01:51:46,811
Hey, what's this?

2056
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,400
Roopesh, this is the
strike tree, rig ht?

2057
01:51:48,401 --> 01:51:49,778
Take it off!

2058
01:51:50,303 --> 01:51:52,112
Isn't this our college as well?

2059
01:51:52,172 --> 01:51:53,344
We want to keep it here.

2060
01:51:53,406 --> 01:51:54,476
Not possible, dear!

2061
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:56,975
We must keep this board
where people can see it!

2062
01:51:56,976 --> 01:51:59,078
Keep it anywhere else.
You can't keep it here!

2063
01:51:59,079 --> 01:52:00,854
Roopesh, we'll sort this out.

2064
01:52:00,914 --> 01:52:02,393
Take it off! Hurry up!

2065
01:52:02,782 --> 01:52:03,760
Paul!

2066
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:07,962
They can stop us only from
keeping the boards, right?

2067
01:52:08,054 --> 01:52:09,192
There's another option!

2068
01:52:09,255 --> 01:52:10,233
We'll shift it!

2069
01:52:11,091 --> 01:52:12,399
Dude, shift it!

2070
01:52:12,826 --> 01:52:15,102
Roopesh, time will avenge you!
Wait <i>&</i> watch!

2071
01:52:15,428 --> 01:52:17,032
Avenge me right now!
Come!

2072
01:52:17,097 --> 01:52:18,167
Don't keep it for later.

2073
01:52:18,264 --> 01:52:19,498
He wants to avenge!

2074
01:52:19,499 --> 01:52:20,944
Keep it behind the toilet!

2075
01:52:21,167 --> 01:52:23,078
Send a notice. We'll
come <i>&</i> see!

2076
01:52:28,374 --> 01:52:30,285
This is enough!
Let that board be there.

2077
01:52:45,859 --> 01:52:47,392
Nice, right?
- Whose picture is this?

2078
01:52:47,393 --> 01:52:48,371
Our Paul's!

2079
01:52:48,928 --> 01:52:50,805
But this doesn't resemble him!

2080
01:52:50,997 --> 01:52:51,975
It's Paul only!

2081
01:52:52,031 --> 01:52:54,307
Just that his shape was
changed a little bit.

2082
01:52:54,968 --> 01:52:56,174
That's nice!

2083
01:52:56,369 --> 01:52:58,076
Anyway his face's shape
is gonna change.

2084
01:52:58,905 --> 01:53:00,782
Well, I didn't mean that.

2085
01:53:11,217 --> 01:53:12,195
Be careful!

2086
01:53:44,918 --> 01:53:45,896
Here VOu go!

2087
01:53:46,519 --> 01:53:47,497
Hold this.

2088
01:53:52,926 --> 01:53:53,904
I'll hold it!

2089
01:54:02,535 --> 01:54:03,513
Come!

2090
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:07,918
Watch out!

2091
01:54:09,242 --> 01:54:10,220
Enough!

2092
01:54:18,651 --> 01:54:19,629
Put it inside!

2093
01:54:24,757 --> 01:54:29,757
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

2094
01:54:53,987 --> 01:54:56,058

Move away!

2096
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:01,968

2097
01:55:02,095 --> 01:55:03,597
They burned the
whole place down!

2098
01:55:08,635 --> 01:55:09,978
We won't leave anyone!

2099
01:55:10,236 --> 01:55:11,510
Hey Principal!

2100
01:55:11,704 --> 01:55:14,116
If you don't take action,
we'll show you what happens!

2101
01:55:14,374 --> 01:55:17,480
Roopesh, I've been telling you.
That we shouldn't have let them go!

2102
01:55:18,945 --> 01:55:20,583
See this!
We'll be back!

2103
01:55:24,384 --> 01:55:26,118
KSQ's strike will intensify.

2104
01:55:26,119 --> 01:55:28,387
At that point of time, I
will send him to join them!

2105
01:55:28,388 --> 01:55:29,594
You both should be here.

2106
01:55:29,956 --> 01:55:31,356
See if anyone is coming!

2107
01:55:31,357 --> 01:55:32,335
Come! Let's go!

2108
01:55:32,659 --> 01:55:34,502
Going there right now
would be a huge mistake.

2109
01:55:35,261 --> 01:55:36,239
<i>Raflesh Chem,</i>

2110
01:55:36,562 --> 01:55:38,667
it will be a problem only if
we don't go there now!

2111
01:55:38,998 --> 01:55:40,409
Subhash, don't be stupid!

2112
01:55:40,466 --> 01:55:43,106
They've gone crazy because their
union office was burned down!

2113
01:55:43,536 --> 01:55:51,245
Come, let's fight the war!

2114
01:55:53,379 --> 01:55:57,486
Scoundrels of SFY!

2115
01:55:57,550 --> 01:55:59,996
Subhash, my opinion is that we
shouldn't start a fight now.

2116
01:56:00,219 --> 01:56:01,926
If we don't go there now,

2117
01:56:02,021 --> 01:56:04,092
they will definitely think
that we burned that place.

2118
01:56:04,223 --> 01:56:05,634
Subhash, your enthusiasm is good!

2119
01:56:05,692 --> 01:56:07,359
But if we go now,
we'll be murdered!

2120
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:08,998
It's such a huge issue!
- Rajesh, we will be blamed for this!

2121
01:56:09,095 --> 01:56:10,073
Subhash, come!

2122
01:56:10,129 --> 01:56:12,200
Those who're interested to
come with me, can come!

2123
01:56:21,174 --> 01:56:24,443
Protest! Protest!

2124
01:56:24,444 --> 01:56:26,355
KSQ's protest!

2125
01:56:26,412 --> 01:56:27,652
Stop it!

2126
01:56:27,714 --> 01:56:29,660
KSQ's protest!

2127
01:56:40,259 --> 01:56:42,068
My dear student friends,

2128
01:56:42,395 --> 01:56:49,973
our KSQ's union office which every student
of this college has been using regularly,

2129
01:56:50,036 --> 01:56:55,281
those scoundrels of SFY have burned
it down, hiding in darkness!

2130
01:56:55,441 --> 01:56:58,547
They have done this because
of their jealousy towards us!

2131
01:56:58,611 --> 01:57:01,683
I saw them burning it during the night!
They burned it down!

2132
01:57:01,781 --> 01:57:03,317
When did you see me burning it?

2133
01:57:03,383 --> 01:57:05,090
Tell me!
How dare you lie about me?

2134
01:57:05,284 --> 01:57:06,422
Let it get more fierce!

2135
01:57:09,055 --> 01:57:10,329
Go! Go!

2136
01:57:15,061 --> 01:57:16,597
Hey, come back!

2137
01:57:21,534 --> 01:57:23,241
When did you see me burning it?

2138
01:57:23,302 --> 01:57:24,440
Hey!

2139
01:57:25,304 --> 01:57:26,282
Shut up!

2140
01:57:26,806 --> 01:57:28,251
All of you shut up!

2141
01:57:31,511 --> 01:57:32,489
Our plan failed!

2142
01:57:32,845 --> 01:57:34,791
There's no point in
shouting inside the campus.

2143
01:57:34,847 --> 01:57:36,448
Give us a written complaint.
We will investigate.

2144
01:57:36,449 --> 01:57:37,792
We don't have any
complaint, Sir.

2145
01:57:38,284 --> 01:57:39,786
Do you have any complaint?
- No!

2146
01:57:40,286 --> 01:57:41,526
For you, Sir?
- No!

2147
01:57:42,321 --> 01:57:43,527
No one has any complaint!

2148
01:57:44,824 --> 01:57:47,361
It's a campus, Sir.
Don't create trouble. Leave it!

2149
01:57:47,827 --> 01:57:48,805
Come!

2150
01:58:17,123 --> 01:58:18,101
Come!

2151
01:58:28,868 --> 01:58:31,144
Where the hell were you guys?

2152
01:58:31,704 --> 01:58:33,206
Did you find out who did this?

2153
01:58:33,439 --> 01:58:35,146
Those kids from SFY.

2154
01:58:35,208 --> 01:58:36,516
They burned the entire place?

2155
01:58:36,676 --> 01:58:38,815
My dear lkka, they burned
even our underwear!

2156
01:58:38,878 --> 01:58:42,223
Why do you need underwear now? Go out
naked. Let them burn the rest too!

2157
01:58:42,281 --> 01:58:43,783
We can't step out
without retaliating!

2158
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:44,828
Such a shame!

2159
01:58:45,451 --> 01:58:46,862
Aren't you ashamed
to say all this?

2160
01:58:47,386 --> 01:58:50,094
If it was during my time, their heads
would've rolled on the floor!

2161
01:58:50,289 --> 01:58:52,424
I will get them thrashed today!
No doubt about that!

2162
01:58:52,425 --> 01:58:53,699
Go! Chop their heads off!

2163
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:56,662
Shiyaz Ikka, there's no
point in getting angry!

2164
01:58:56,729 --> 01:58:57,833
Let the election get over.

2165
01:58:57,897 --> 01:58:59,331
I know what to do with him!

2166
01:58:59,332 --> 01:59:00,538
Will it be anytime soon?

2167
01:59:02,869 --> 01:59:04,678
I have arranged people
to beat them up.

2168
01:59:05,304 --> 01:59:07,443
But we can't do anything
until the election is over.

2169
01:59:07,673 --> 01:59:09,778
We'll get all this
converted into votes.

2170
01:59:09,842 --> 01:59:11,515
They burned it, right?
Let them burn it!

2171
01:59:11,611 --> 01:59:13,591
The blue flags were
all burned down!

2172
01:59:13,646 --> 01:59:16,252
If we go there and thrash
them right now like you said,

2173
01:59:16,382 --> 01:59:19,226
he will get all these votes
converted into his pocket!

2174
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:20,724
What will you do then?

2175
01:59:20,853 --> 01:59:22,420
What to do?
What will I do?

2176
01:59:22,421 --> 01:59:24,256
We'll fail miserably.
Then burn this as well!

2177
01:59:24,257 --> 01:59:26,931
We have to break the arms <i>&</i> legs of
those who burned the union office!

2178
01:59:27,193 --> 01:59:29,537
Roopesh has become a
pacifist these days.

2179
01:59:29,595 --> 01:59:31,596
If we move forward
cleverly just this once,

2180
01:59:31,597 --> 01:59:33,167
we will always have
this in our hands.

2181
01:59:33,966 --> 01:59:35,946
They played much bigger
games than we expected!

2182
01:59:39,739 --> 01:59:40,717
<i>Raflesh Chem,</i>

2183
01:59:41,407 --> 01:59:43,944
that sympathy would earn us the
support of all the students.

2184
01:59:44,410 --> 01:59:46,890
Every vote after that would be
for this individual called Paul!

2185
01:59:47,713 --> 01:59:49,420
After we win, we will
hoist a red flag here!

2186
01:59:49,615 --> 01:59:50,719
First personally,

2187
01:59:50,917 --> 01:59:52,157
then politically.

2188
01:59:52,318 --> 01:59:54,264
This doesn't suit our party, man!

2189
01:59:55,388 --> 01:59:57,595
And now I think that
you're a back-stabber!

2190
01:59:58,591 --> 02:00:00,468
This is a game we're
playing only to win!

2191
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:02,432
Nobody else should know this!

2192
02:00:08,768 --> 02:00:09,838
What's your plan?

2193
02:00:11,904 --> 02:00:13,638
Anyway, we've come
so far, Sh iyaz Ikka.

2194
02:00:13,639 --> 02:00:15,414
We'll wait till the
election is over.

2195
02:00:15,675 --> 02:00:17,484
Why do you want to wait till then?

2196
02:00:17,643 --> 02:00:20,886
We should do something! They
shouldn't think that we're schmucks!

2197
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:22,959
Whatever happens, I'll take care!

2198
02:00:23,716 --> 02:00:24,694
Shiyaz Ikka,

2199
02:00:24,750 --> 02:00:27,594
I had decided his fate on
the day he broke our flag!

2200
02:00:28,487 --> 02:00:30,797
Wait until the election
is over, Shiyaz Ikka.

2201
02:00:31,023 --> 02:00:32,468
After that, we'll finish them!

2202
02:00:35,895 --> 02:00:39,240
No one should raise their
hands against us hereafter!

2203
02:00:40,032 --> 02:00:42,444
What we're going to do should
prove that to everyone!

2204
02:00:52,578 --> 02:00:54,683
'Meet the candidate' function
is happening tomorrow.

2205
02:00:56,349 --> 02:00:59,694
This is our last chance to say
something to the entire campus.

2206
02:01:00,353 --> 02:01:02,959
There's no point in saying
random things to defame them.

2207
02:01:03,022 --> 02:01:04,592
The points we make should be solid.

2208
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:10,002
About them torturing us inside the cam pus
because we wrote 'SFY' on the wall;

2209
02:01:10,763 --> 02:01:14,599
And the girl who we took to participate in
the arts festival with a lot of difficulty,

2210
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:16,409
They made her switch
sides after she won!

2211
02:01:16,769 --> 02:01:18,009
Apart from all this,

2212
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:19,716
there's something
that we must say.

2213
02:01:20,339 --> 02:01:23,479
You should say that Roopesh himself
burned down their union office,

2214
02:01:23,576 --> 02:01:25,715
to put the blame on us!

2215
02:01:28,047 --> 02:01:31,893
But we don't have any proof to
say that Roopesh did it, right?

2216
02:01:31,984 --> 02:01:33,793
The allegation is against us.

2217
02:01:34,086 --> 02:01:35,588
We should get that
off our shoulders.

2218
02:01:35,688 --> 02:01:37,889
They are using that as their
strongest weapon against us.

2219
02:01:37,890 --> 02:01:40,625
If we prove that we are innocent and
the allegation becomes against them,

2220
02:01:40,626 --> 02:01:42,697
that will be the strongest
factor to get us votes.

2221
02:01:45,298 --> 02:01:48,370
Your speech tomorrow
will decide ourfate!

2222
02:01:49,302 --> 02:01:54,302

Everyone, please remain silent.

Hail SFY!

First of all,

2234
02:02:54,033 --> 02:02:57,446
- For the 'Meet the candidate' programme.
- Keep quiet!

2235
02:02:59,839 --> 02:03:01,910
Long Live the Revolution!

2236
02:03:02,141 --> 02:03:04,052
For 'Meet the candidate', firstly,

2237
02:03:04,110 --> 02:03:08,490
I invite Mr.Roopesh who's contesting
as the chairman candidate for KSQ,

2238
02:03:09,515 --> 02:03:12,553
to speak a few words to you!

2239
02:03:12,685 --> 02:03:14,756
'We won't step back'

2240
02:03:15,488 --> 02:03:17,434
'Ever step we take
is a step forward'

2241
02:03:17,490 --> 02:03:19,401
Hail KSQ!

2242
02:03:19,492 --> 02:03:21,096
Hail Roopesh!

2243
02:03:24,964 --> 02:03:26,841
Hail Roopesh!

2244
02:03:27,166 --> 02:03:29,578
Hail Roopesh!

2245
02:03:30,503 --> 02:03:31,948
My dear student friends,

2246
02:03:32,638 --> 02:03:34,879
I am contesting as the
chairman candidate this time,

2247
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:37,477
from the progressive educational party
- KSQ!

2248
02:03:38,944 --> 02:03:42,983
Some parties and leaders who suddenly
sprout during the elections alone,

2249
02:03:43,416 --> 02:03:49,162
have come forward against me
and KSQ with many allegations.

2250
02:03:50,022 --> 02:03:52,924
I humbly request you to respond to
such people through the ballot,

2251
02:03:52,925 --> 02:03:56,461
and to make me, who stands for
permanent progressive ideologies,

2252
02:03:56,462 --> 02:03:59,602
and democratic values,
contesting from KSQ party;

2253
02:03:59,665 --> 02:04:02,145
win the Chairman post
in this election!

2254
02:04:02,902 --> 02:04:04,142
Hail KSQ!

2255
02:04:04,203 --> 02:04:05,580
Hail India!

2256
02:04:05,971 --> 02:04:08,178
Hail KSQ!

2257
02:04:11,744 --> 02:04:14,054
Next, I invite the SFY candidate,

2258
02:04:14,513 --> 02:04:15,890
Mr.Paul Varghese,

2259
02:04:15,948 --> 02:04:16,926
to speak a few words.

2260
02:04:17,049 --> 02:04:18,824
- Salute!
- Please keep silence!

2261
02:04:19,518 --> 02:04:21,520
A hundred red salutes!

2262
02:04:21,887 --> 02:04:23,025
Get lost!

2263
02:04:25,724 --> 02:04:27,533
A hundred red salutes!

2264
02:04:32,198 --> 02:04:35,873
Hail SFY!

2265
02:04:36,268 --> 02:04:38,839
Long Live the Revolution!

2266
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:43,178
My dear student friends,

2267
02:04:44,109 --> 02:04:46,521
when I come on to this stage to speak,

2268
02:04:46,745 --> 02:04:48,019
you might howl at me,

2269
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:49,488
you might mock me!

2270
02:04:49,548 --> 02:04:50,526
Get lost!

2271
02:04:52,485 --> 02:04:54,226
This year, when the
election ends,

2272
02:04:55,554 --> 02:04:57,500
if a flag is going to rise
in this college,

2273
02:04:57,590 --> 02:04:59,763
that will be the red flag of SFY!

2274
02:05:02,161 --> 02:05:03,731
For the past few years,

2275
02:05:03,796 --> 02:05:06,764
a barbaric rule by KSQ
under Roopesh's leadership

2276
02:05:06,765 --> 02:05:09,109
has been happening here.

2277
02:05:10,236 --> 02:05:13,774
To put an end to this
political anarchy;

2278
02:05:14,039 --> 02:05:18,510
that's my goal along with each candidate
who's contesting from SFY's panel.

2279
02:05:19,111 --> 02:05:20,749
During the previous
college arts festival,

2280
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:25,750
many talented artists were
not allowed to compete,

2281
02:05:25,751 --> 02:05:28,698
just because they
were SFY supporters.

2282
02:05:29,088 --> 02:05:31,034
As part of a plan to defame us,

2283
02:05:31,857 --> 02:05:34,064
they burned down their
own union office,

2284
02:05:34,126 --> 02:05:36,197
and tried to put
the blame on us!

2285
02:05:36,295 --> 02:05:37,933
Who burned it?
- You did it!

2286
02:05:51,143 --> 02:05:52,747
Subhash, stop them!

2287
02:05:55,881 --> 02:05:57,326
They will kill him!

2288
02:06:01,053 --> 02:06:02,157
I didn't bring them!

2289
02:07:09,288 --> 02:07:11,666
Roopesh, ask your men
to stop hitting him!

2290
02:07:14,893 --> 02:07:16,338
My dear student friends,

2291
02:07:16,395 --> 02:07:18,966
please allow me to make an
important announcement.

2292
02:07:20,165 --> 02:07:23,301
SFY had decided to make Subhash
the chairman candidate initially.

2293
02:07:23,302 --> 02:07:26,715
And then, under a special circumstance,
Paul had to become the candidate.

2294
02:07:26,839 --> 02:07:29,407
This Subhash was the one who
burned the union office

2295
02:07:29,408 --> 02:07:32,753
so that Roopesh <i>&</i> friends
will have a grudge on Paul!

2296
02:07:36,782 --> 02:07:38,056
If you don't believe me,

2297
02:07:38,217 --> 02:07:39,719
Subhash is standing right here.

2298
02:07:39,785 --> 02:07:41,196
Let Subhash speak the truth!

2299
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:43,128
My dear student friends,

2300
02:07:43,188 --> 02:07:46,090
I didnfiét confess all
this to get votes.

2301
02:07:46,091 --> 02:07:49,961
But I don't want my dear comrade
to be beaten like a dog.

2302
02:07:49,962 --> 02:07:51,635
Roopesh, it's not
like you think!

2303
02:07:51,697 --> 02:07:52,869
You scoundrel!
- I can explain!

2304
02:07:52,931 --> 02:07:53,932
Stop there, you!

2305
02:08:16,288 --> 02:08:21,288
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

2306
02:08:45,818 --> 02:08:46,951
You will get just 2 votes!

2307
02:08:46,952 --> 02:08:48,454
And a lot of poundings
after the election.

2308
02:08:49,188 --> 02:08:50,166
Roopesh,

2309
02:08:50,355 --> 02:08:53,199
there will be hundreds who
would join you to beat me up.

2310
02:08:53,492 --> 02:08:55,494
But when I get
beaten up all alone,

2311
02:08:55,828 --> 02:08:57,330
I just want one person
to stand up for me.

2312
02:08:57,763 --> 02:08:59,071
I need that one vote alone!

2313
02:09:10,042 --> 02:09:11,020
Hey!

2314
02:09:11,543 --> 02:09:13,352
Did you vote?
- Yes. I did.

2315
02:09:13,812 --> 02:09:15,519
Won't our party win?
- Of course!

2316
02:09:15,748 --> 02:09:17,318
By the way, whom
did you vote for?

2317
02:09:17,983 --> 02:09:19,183
By the way, who are you?

2318
02:09:19,184 --> 02:09:20,162
<i>Great'.!</i>

2319
02:09:28,026 --> 02:09:29,937
The election counting has commenced.

2320
02:09:30,262 --> 02:09:35,837
All the students are requested to move out
of the premises of the polling station.

2321
02:09:36,969 --> 02:09:41,475
Hail KSQ!

2322
02:09:41,907 --> 02:09:42,885
Hey.

2323
02:09:43,242 --> 02:09:45,076
I will count Paul's votes.

2324
02:09:45,077 --> 02:09:46,181
I'm really tired.

2325
02:09:46,245 --> 02:09:47,952
Counting Paul's votes
won't take too long!

2326
02:09:49,848 --> 02:09:50,792
Roopesh.

2327
02:09:52,885 --> 02:09:53,863
Roopesh.

2328
02:09:54,219 --> 02:09:55,197
Paul.

2329
02:09:58,490 --> 02:09:59,468
Roopesh.

2330
02:09:59,558 --> 02:10:00,536
Paul.

2331
02:10:09,968 --> 02:10:10,946
Paul, again.

2332
02:10:11,036 --> 02:10:12,071
Paul, again.

2333
02:10:12,237 --> 02:10:15,343
Roopesh, the fight that happened
during 'Meet the candidate',

2334
02:10:15,407 --> 02:10:17,216
that wasn't done by your Shiyaz Ikka.

2335
02:10:17,576 --> 02:10:19,112
That was Subhash's plan!

2336
02:10:33,091 --> 02:10:36,402
For Subhash, his ideology is more
important than his own life!

2337
02:10:36,995 --> 02:10:38,529
This is an end to your dictatorship.

2338
02:10:38,530 --> 02:10:41,204
Hereafter, it will be democracy,
that will be in practice here.

2339
02:10:49,274 --> 02:10:51,550
Roopesh, keeping Shikhandi in front"
- Shut up!

2340
02:10:56,114 --> 02:10:57,092
Stop it!

2341
02:10:59,418 --> 02:11:00,920
Is this our party?

2342
02:11:01,386 --> 02:11:02,386
Comrade,

2343
02:11:02,387 --> 02:11:04,367
there was someone called
Raghavettan near my house.

2344
02:11:05,224 --> 02:11:06,828
Everyone used to
call him comrade.

2345
02:11:07,926 --> 02:11:09,963
Whoever he met, he had
only one thing to ask -

2346
02:11:10,462 --> 02:11:12,373
whether that person has
eaten something or not!

2347
02:11:12,531 --> 02:11:14,602
Even if it is to a person
who's coming to kill him!

2348
02:11:15,234 --> 02:11:18,078
I held the red flag for the first
time inspired by that Raghavettan!

2349
02:11:18,136 --> 02:11:19,979
And when my blood boiled,
I shouted slogans!

2350
02:11:21,139 --> 02:11:22,140
Since when did the party"

2351
02:11:22,941 --> 02:11:24,978
Since when did the party
start manufacturing martyrs?

2352
02:11:27,012 --> 02:11:28,650
If so, I'll be the
first martyr, comrade!

2353
02:11:29,514 --> 02:11:30,618
Subhash, sit down.

2354
02:11:31,650 --> 02:11:32,628
What's your problem?

2355
02:11:34,686 --> 02:11:36,597
Why did the party
decide to kill Paul?

2356
02:11:38,190 --> 02:11:39,294
Who decided that?

2357
02:11:40,092 --> 02:11:41,162
What was decided?

2358
02:11:41,293 --> 02:11:42,601
Don't act in front
of me, comrade.

2359
02:11:42,661 --> 02:11:44,106
<i>Sun“ Chem“ 'Md
me evenjthhg'.!</i>

2360
02:11:44,363 --> 02:11:45,933
Is Sunil the party?

2361
02:11:46,465 --> 02:11:48,138
Is he the party's ideology?

2362
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:50,971
He got a party membership
only very recently.

2363
02:11:51,036 --> 02:11:53,277
And you think he's the
best comrade in the party?

2364
02:11:54,239 --> 02:11:56,116
You mentioned about a Raghavettan, right?

2365
02:11:57,042 --> 02:11:59,318
Thousands of such Raghavettans

2366
02:11:59,378 --> 02:12:00,948
are the strength of this party!

2367
02:12:01,513 --> 02:12:04,494
So don't try to judge this party
from the stories fabricated by

2368
02:12:05,117 --> 02:12:07,097
age-old newspapers!

2369
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:11,126
The party has no idea about the
plan you mentioned right now!

2370
02:12:13,158 --> 02:12:14,501
Maybe you don't
know it, comrade.

2371
02:12:15,027 --> 02:12:17,228
When we said that this party is
more important than an individual,

2372
02:12:17,229 --> 02:12:18,936
comrade Raghavan corrected us

2373
02:12:18,997 --> 02:12:21,603
<i>&</i> told that personal relationships
are more important than the party!

2374
02:12:21,667 --> 02:12:24,204
And if the same party has
decided to kill my friend,

2375
02:12:24,269 --> 02:12:25,270
I don't need this party!

2376
02:12:25,370 --> 02:12:26,644
Get lost!
- Subhash, wait!

2377
02:12:28,707 --> 02:12:30,608
If there's a problem
in a family,

2378
02:12:30,609 --> 02:12:32,987
we have to get rid of the person
who created that problem.

2379
02:12:33,178 --> 02:12:34,657
And not people like him!

2380
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:38,652
People like Sunil shouldn't
be allowed to join the party!

2381
02:12:42,554 --> 02:12:45,501
Our party's job is not to
get more people to join us!

2382
02:12:46,458 --> 02:12:49,701
Wejust need 2 people who can
do anything for us!

2383
02:12:50,395 --> 02:12:51,738
To hold the red flag,

2384
02:12:52,064 --> 02:12:53,600
just one hand is needed!

2385
02:12:54,666 --> 02:12:55,644
Subhash,

2386
02:12:57,235 --> 02:13:00,341
this party is in need
of people like you now!

2387
02:13:23,662 --> 02:13:26,233
In this year's college
union election,

2388
02:13:26,365 --> 02:13:30,609
KSQ's chairman
candidate, Mr.Roopesh,

2389
02:13:32,704 --> 02:13:35,241
has been beaten by a
margin of 425 votes,

2390

has won the election!
