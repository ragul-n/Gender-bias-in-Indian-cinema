1
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,298
"You're the feeling,
lam your image."

2
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,737
"You're the antidote,
lam ailing."

3
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:13,140
"You're generous..and
lam selfish."

4
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,670
"You're the song,
lam the words."

5
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,374
"You're the prayer,
lam the duty."

6
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,615
"You're free,
and I am chained."

7
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,352
"You're the dusk,
and I am the praise."

8
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,950
"You're sanctity,
lam the pain."

9
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:35,022
"When I met you,
I had the entire world."

10
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,768
"You're the dream,
and I am reality."

11
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,498
"I admit you're my fate."

12
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,600
"I feel drawn towards you."

13
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:50,909
"It's your grace.."

14
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:55,711
"..that pulled me
out of the darkness."

15
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:01,449
"It's your grace.."

16
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:06,288
"..that changed me completely."

17
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,072
"You're the feeling,
lam your image."

18
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,544
"You're the antidote,
lam ailing."

19
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:26,606
"You're generous..and
lam selfish."

20
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,578
"You're the song,
lam the words."

21
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,146
"You're the prayer,
lam the duty."

22
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:37,386
"You're free,
and I am chained."

23
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:41,193
"You're the dusk,
and I am the praise."

24
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,666
"You're sanctity,
lam the pain."

25
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:48,896
"When I met you,
I had the entire world."

26
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,631
"You're the dream,
and I am reality."

27
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,269
"I admit you're my fate."

28
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:59,508
"I feel drawn towards you."

29
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:04,487
"It's your grace.."

30
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:09,786
"..that pulled me
out of the darkness."

31
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:15,394
"It's your grace.."

32
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:20,128
"..that changed me completely."

33
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,049
"My love..you're my tormentor."

34
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,019
"You're my deluge and my dawn."

35
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,318
"lam your path."

36
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,258
"You're the boat,
lam the shore."

37
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,561
"My love..you're my tormentor."

38
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,757
"You're my deluge and my dawn."

39
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,759
"lam your path."

40
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,768
"You're the boat,
lam the shore."

41
00:04:55,061 --> 00:05:00,033
"It's your grace.."

42
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,074
"..that pulled me
out of the darkness."

43
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:10,511
"It's your grace.."

44
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,390
"..that changed me completely."

45
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:20,825
"It's your grace.."

46
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:26,263
"..that pulled me
out of the darkness."

47
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:31,836
"It's your grace.."

48
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:37,241
"..that changed me completely."

49
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,608
Sheila, you?

50
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:46,822
What's this?

51
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,317
You r g race.

52
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,290
MY grace?

53
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,856
Nice poster, isn't it?

54
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,689
This film
will release next week.

55
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,863
But right now, you're here to watch
Shaukeens(Romantic at heart)"

56
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,630
...so let's focus on that.

57
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,866
Delhi, a fun-loving city.

58
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,802
Frankly speaking,
this city has..

59
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,501
...more twists and
turns than my films.

60
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,808
You'll find romance,
but at someone's tomb.

61
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,680
Drama, at temples.

62
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,615
Comedy,
at some memorial service.

63
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,049
And fights
are common on streets.

64
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,725
And what makes this
city so fun-loving..

65
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,526
...are the men.

66
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,836
Take them for instance.

67
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,773
Lali, KD and Pinky.

68
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,937
They've all turned 60..

69
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,513
...but their nature hasn't changed.

70
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,376
The sight of a girl..

71
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,418
...still makes their tail wag.

72
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,422
The reason
behind their condition"

73
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,682
...is their loneliness.

74
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,200
Lali.

75
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,430
There's a serious dearth
of hair and fun in their lives.

76
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,267
Technically speaking,
he has a big family.

77
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,470
A shoe-store
at Connaught Place.

78
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,946
And respect in the society.

79
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,617
But still lonely at heart.

80
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,125
You'll ask why.

81
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,769
His wife
has turned religious..

82
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,138
...and distanced herself
from married life.

83
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,211
Due to which
Lali has been showing..

84
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,338
...a strong
interest in fashion.

85
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,783
Lali's younger sister,
Chanchal.

86
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,014
Poor girl got divorced
a week after her marriage.

87
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:05,895
And son..

88
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,188
He's a real sample.

89
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,393
He deliberately
gets pictures taken"

90
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,437
...for posters
at his father's shop..

91
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,696
Mom, my milk.

92
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,735
And thinks he's a model.

93
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,684
Anyway, Lali is not
interested in his son.

94
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,118
But he's very
interested in women.

95
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,254
Fed up of the austerity
in his house..

96
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,494
...Lali's found some
sanctity at his store.

97
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,539
Frontier Boot House for Men..

98
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,635
...is now Ladies Shoe House.

99
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,472
And finally Lali's life
has become a bit colorful.

100
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:05,447
"There is no relief from this pain."

101
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:11,352
"Are you a lover or a butcher?"

102
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,435
Similarly, his friend Pinky..

103
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,971
...is dealing with
an utterly boring life.

104
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,731
Harishankar Goyal.

105
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,504
His life is more like
an unfulfilled dream.

106
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,211
He had to take care of his
father's business at a young age..

107
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,908
...and couldn't
complete his education.

108
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,776
As soon as he was old enough
his father got him married.

109
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,047
So no girlfriends.

110
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,653
He had kids
right after marriage.

111
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,786
So no fun with the missus.

112
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,023
When his sons grew up..

113
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,290
...he thought he'll go
globetrotting with his wife.

114
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,893
But his wife went to
the heavenly abode instead.

115
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,670
By the way, Mr. Goyal is the
richest amongst his three friends.

116
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,806
He's the king of Catch
Spices at Chandni Chowk.

117
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,638
Two sons and their wives.

118
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,177
In fact,
he's even a grandpa now.

119
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,709
But he's unhappy.

120
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,550
And so he's
got a grumpy nature.

121
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,215
But recently
he's seen a ray of hope.

122
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,416
Hi. Excuse me.

123
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:18,992
"When there is love in the world."

124
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:24,800
"Wonder why this heart asks for more?"

125
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,542
An Angel has descended
right opposite to him.

126
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:32,868
Angie!

127
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,143
I guess Pinky's in
love with this masseuse.

128
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,508
But there's one problem.

129
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,614
'English.'

130
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:46,053
Frankly, Pinkly loves
girls that speak English.

131
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,323
And Angie speaks only English.

132
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,818
But he doesn't know English.

133
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,023
So how can they talk?

134
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:58,297
I guess this love-story
will always be incomplete.

135
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:00,996
I feel sad.

136
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,833
But not for the next one.

137
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,604
Kamal Dheer Sharma, aka..KD.

138
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,806
He's the real image
of Delhi's passion.

139
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,976
He's rich,
stylish, overly-connected.

140
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,247
...and a big gloat.

141
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,447
And why not.
He's a bachelor after all.

142
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,686
He's 60, but his attitude
is not a day over 30.

143
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,426
It's still
really easy for him..

144
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,330
...to befriend females.

145
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,032
Pinky considers him
as his love and sex guru.

146
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:36,971
But the truth is..

147
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,873
"That sex is miles
away from his life.

148
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:44,413
But still..he
runs an NGO for widows.

149
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,582
He's like an angel
for these helpless women.

150
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,820
But for KD, this is an opportunity
to prepare for the real thing.

151
00:11:56,415 --> 00:12:00,124
KD tries these
tricks outside too.

152
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,163
Because in this ambiance..

153
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,964
...he can only be benevolent,
not a lover.

154
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,702
We've heard that
in his younger days..

155
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,710
...KD was in love with someone.

156
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:22,376
"Why to get stuck at one place?"

157
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,948
Later she got married..

158
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,252
...and KD decided
never to get married.

159
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,824
This is just a rumor.

160
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,358
I don't guarantee
this story's true.

161
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,092
You must be wondering
why Akshay Kumar..

162
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:40,897
...that's me, is so interested
in three old perverts of Delhi?

163
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,001
Take a look for yourself.

164
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,868
What's wrong, uncle?

165
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,931
She's like your daughter.

166
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,274
Forget it.. - No, dear.
You don't know these old men.

167
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,882
They come here to get in the mood.

168
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,573
Stop talking rubbish.

169
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,680
You've been doing dirty
things behind the bush..

170
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,946
...and blaming me
of being ill-mannered.

171
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,385
Do you see that?

172
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,182
Such shameless kids these days.

173
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,959
Stop all this. Or I'll have you
thrown out of the park.

174
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,392
Hey old man..

175
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,155
Gentleman. Gentleman.

176
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,425
Stay in your limit!

177
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,023
Gentlemen..please don't fight.

178
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,067
They are sorry. You can continue.

179
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,070
You can please carry on.
They are sorry.

180
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,537
Okay, let's go.

181
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,163
He was misbehaving.

182
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,168
Why did you have to apologize?
- Yes.

183
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,436
We weren't the ones
behind the bushes. - Right.

184
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,771
I would've ruined
that boy's career..

185
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,372
...even before it took off.

186
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:26,949
Do you know who I am?

187
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,848
I don't know about you.
But I know who I am.

188
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,346
How embarrassing was
that cheap behavior of yours.

189
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,445
What cheap, embarrassing behavior?

190
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,388
What did we do? - Not us, you.

191
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,555
Why did you have
to peak in the bushes?

192
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,487
If that boy hadn't interfered"

193
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,254
...he would be sitting on her lap.

194
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,661
Don't be so ridiculous, Lali.

195
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:43,859
I am ridiculous.

196
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,694
I am the Secretary of the
Shopkeeper's Committee of our area.

197
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,699
We can't act so cheaply in the open.

198
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,436
Try to be discreet.

199
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,702
Mr. Lalwani, how are you sir?

200
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,743
Hello, Mr. Sehgal.

201
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,142
It's been a long time
since you've been to my shop.

202
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,681
I definitely will, sir.
When is the committee meeting?

203
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,340
Next Friday..Friday the 13th.

204
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,045
Give my regards to Mrs. Sehgal.

205
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,279
Okay. - Okay, see you.

206
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:03,682
See.

207
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,445
People respect me a lot.

208
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:06,553
Not like you two.

209
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,716
Lali, you're overdoing it now.

210
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:09,982
Look, Pinky.

211
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,488
Abuses and name-calling
may be common in Chandni Chowk.

212
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,527
But not here.

213
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,155
This is an educated society.
Get that?

214
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,929
Why do you stress so much
on education for everything?

215
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,434
I've got an Audi.

216
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,595
So what? - Enough, stop this.

217
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,661
Stop fighting amongst yourselves.

218
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,600
Don't waste a Sunday.

219
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,603
So what's the plan?

220
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:30,678
Tell us.

221
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,679
The plan's right ahead. Come on.

222
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,024
On the right.

223
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,425
On the right. - I did.

224
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,896
2..3..and bend!

225
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,462
2..3..and up!

226
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,361
What a sight?

227
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,739
I can say she's married.

228
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,204
I don't think so. - 200%.

229
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,505
But you know..

230
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,239
Married girls don't
satisfy me anymore.

231
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,547
Look to your left, foreigners.

232
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,718
Ogling secretly is no more fun.

233
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,260
What are you doing?
Put on your spectacles.

234
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,886
...or else people will
know what we're staring at.

235
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,921
How long will we just watch?

236
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,565
Take my advice,
let's get some action tonight.

237
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,829
Action. - What?

238
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,096
There he goes again.

239
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,265
Let him speak, Lali.

240
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,636
What do you mean action?

241
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,266
Escort service.

242
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,468
Girls will come home.

243
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,172
No, it's not safe.

244
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,339
It's absolutely safe, Lali.

245
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,439
This is Delhi.

246
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,245
You can get everything
with just a call.

247
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,250
Lali, you backed out
the last time as well.

248
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,614
Let's try it once.

249
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,179
We might get lucky.
- Only boys do such things.

250
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,545
We're respectable people.

251
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,492
What if someone
spots us at the hotel?

252
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,050
And these days they make MMS clips.

253
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,653
Who's talking about hotel?

254
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,854
My idea, my risk!

255
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,928
The action will take
place at my farm house.

256
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,244
Where the hell are they?

257
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,380
Did you give them
the right address? - 200%

258
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,977
I don't have a good
feeling about this.

259
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,847
Let's cancel this. - No..

260
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,749
Here come the girls.

261
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,522
My babies..

262
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,023
Come on.

263
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,597
Come on.

264
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,261
They are old.

265
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,061
You said it's a bachelor's party.

266
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,731
Not a bachelor's party"

267
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,437
...I said the party is bachelor.

268
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,806
Look

269
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,005
What if they get a heart attack?

270
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,807
Kid, its short work.

271
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,509
Do it, please.

272
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,612
Dude, they're real old.

273
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,450
Who are you calling old?

274
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,621
Come on, turn the car around.

275
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,019
Come on. - Who are you calling old?

276
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,457
Stop the car.
Hey..

277
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,252
Who are you calling old?

278
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,129
Cheap girl.

279
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,461
You call us strong men, old.

280
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,166
KD.

281
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,859
<i>Vicky.</i>

282
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,995
The DCP of Janakpuri is my buddy.

283
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,170
I'll shut down yourjoints.

284
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:13,971
Calling me old.

285
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,411
I won't spare that pimp.

286
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,079
He doesn't know who I am.

287
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,842
Cool down.

288
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,976
A cassata for him.

289
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,982
KD, your planning is never any good.

290
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,915
You weren't in the mood at first.

291
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:29,755
Then you were.

292
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,054
Then you lost it.

293
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,124
As the girls left, so did my mood.

294
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,433
This is the worst Sunday of my life.

295
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,367
We did not do anything
and the rascals called us old.

296
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,961
Pinky.. - Forget it.

297
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,995
Sunday isn't over yet.

298
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,972
It is. - Look around.

299
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,367
Take a look.

300
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,279
That girl gestured towards me..

301
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,246
...and turned towards that tree.

302
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,576
We just flopped badly a minute ago.

303
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,482
Your name should be KLPD, not KD.

304
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,622
Lali, by God, I am not lying.

305
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,385
What do you want to do? - Come on.

306
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,186
No!

307
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:03,919
Come on.

308
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,953
For the sake of our friendship,
let's go.

309
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,291
We'll have to talk to her first.

310
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,390
I am an expert in talking to girls.

311
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,499
Have trust.

312
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:12,899
Come on.

313
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,002
But..what will you say?

314
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:26,345
Hello.

315
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,453
There are three of us.

316
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,048
And we even have a car.

317
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,053
We live close-by.

318
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,552
Darling. - Yes.

319
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,092
I'll just call you back.

320
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,460
Three oldies are trying
to get fresh with me.

321
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:42,631
I'll set them straight first.

322
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,224
What were you saying?
- Who weren't flirting?

323
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:44,960
Police!

324
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,395
Police! - We were just leaving..

325
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,596
Where are you going?

326
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,673
Dear! Dear! Please forgive us!

327
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:50,568
Dear.

328
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,711
Don't touch me. - Calm down!

329
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,937
Calm down, for God's sake.

330
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:56,705
We can Pa}! You-

331
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,843
Pay me? For what?

332
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,415
Who do you think I am?

333
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,644
It was a mistake.

334
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,878
Police! Police!
- What's wrong, madam?

335
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,653
Why are you hugging this old man?

336
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:09,519
Inspector, these three
old men were harassing me.

337
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,559
And this one..

338
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,060
He was saying obscene things.

339
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,758
Inspector,
take them to the police station.

340
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,830
Make them lie down
on ice slabs and beat them.

341
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,132
He's like your father, dear.
You shouldn't say such things.

342
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,365
Again.. - Hold on.

343
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,372
Don't you own a shoe-store at CP.

344
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,135
Yes.

345
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,302
Shoe-store.

346
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,936
Beat him with his own shoes.

347
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,469
Madam, calm down.

348
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,106
Listen up, everyone will have
to come to the police station. - No.

349
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,150
Hari Singh,
get these old men in the van.

350
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,915
Madam, you may leave.

351
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:41,383
Come on.

352
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,359
Inspector,
there was a bit of misunderstanding.

353
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,724
I only asked her..

354
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,392
...whether we can drop her home.
She was all alone.

355
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,031
Its late night.

356
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,395
He's absolutely right.

357
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,470
We're respectable people.

358
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,968
You know me.

359
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,503
It was all a mistake, forgive us.

360
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,974
Mistake? Forgive you?

361
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,640
But..what pill did you all take"

362
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,374
"that made you so
pervert at this age?

363
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,281
You're right.

364
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,543
We'll stay in control.

365
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,209
Lali. Pinky.

366
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,944
We've to work on this. - Yes.

367
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,284
You must be just a few
years older than my father.

368
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,183
These things don't suit you.

369
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,920
Point noted, son.

370
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,153
Bless you.

371
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,657
How much do you have?

372
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:21,987
Check it.

373
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,499
Must be around 10.. - Is that all?

374
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,995
Do you take credit card?

375
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,433
Are you crazy?

376
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,003
Come on, get lost.

377
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:37,645
And listen,
I've a free advice for you.

378
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,672
If you're all feeling so erotic"

379
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,640
...then, there's nothing
you can do here.

380
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,909
Go to some foreign country.

381
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,184
These things are legal out there.

382
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,820
Do you know any place
where it's all legal?

383
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,526
Bangkok.

384
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,958
You can find 50 girls
at every 500 meters.

385
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,368
All like those.

386
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,897
Are you sure? - 200%

387
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,339
Delhi's no longer safe for us.

388
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,672
Take my advice,
let's get out of here.

389
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,946
To the capital of debauchery.
Bangkok.

390
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,317
<i>Bunty. Rim.</i>

391
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,115
Bring my food.

392
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,325
Quickly.

393
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,458
Right away, father.
Come on fast.

394
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,125
Lucky, get my pajama.

395
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,563
Blue or white.

396
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:32,658
Bring the blue one.

397
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,469
But..the blue one's wet.

398
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,231
Get the blue one.

399
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,006
Heat the lentil little more.

400
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,467
Or he'll get furious.

401
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:42,305
And I've to talk
to him about Mauritius.

402
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,179
It's wet.

403
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,144
Father, I told you
the blue one's wet.

404
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,284
Get the white one.

405
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,244
Yes.

406
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,480
Where's my food?

407
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,285
Father"

408
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:01,823
You know Bhanu..our
distributer in Mauritius.

409
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,462
He's invited us to Mauritius.

410
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,027
He'll pay all the expenses.

411
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:13,675
If we could go to
Mauritius for a week.

412
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:14,836
Go ahead.

413
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:20,510
And anyway, I am going
on a holiday with KD and Lali.

414
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,377
To Bangkok.

415
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,283
Bangkok?

416
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,151
Bangkok?

417
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,221
Father, Bangkok?

418
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,124
What happened?

419
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,794
Father's going to Bangkok.

420
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,519
What?

421
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,195
Bangkok, at this age?

422
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,296
What's wrong with it?

423
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,161
There's a Buddhist Temple.

424
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,766
Dense forests.

425
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,171
Also one-tusk elephants.

426
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,408
But, father..you can see those"

427
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,137
...in Ram Nagar and Corbett too.

428
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,938
And Ranchi's full
of Buddhist temples.

429
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,680
But why Bangkok?

430
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,041
And father,
everyone will laugh at us.

431
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,752
Everyone knows what
goes on at Bangkok.

432
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,115
But we didn't know.

433
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:02,553
Now that I do, we won't go.

434
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:03,588
<i>Okay'</i>

435
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,225
It needs more salt!

436
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,302
Brother, how's KD?

437
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,202
KD?

438
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,840
He's still the same. Jolly.

439
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,381
He hasn't come home for a long time.

440
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,739
Has he gone out?

441
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,178
He's still in the city for now.

442
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,078
But going out next week.

443
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,085
Where?

444
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,023
On a holiday, with Pinky and me.

445
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,790
Bangkok.

446
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,293
What?

447
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,632
You three are going to Bangkok.

448
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,935
Who's going to Bangkok?
- Your father.

449
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,439
O Lord! O Lord! O Lord!

450
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:51,639
Listen"

451
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,570
Dad, you? - Why? What happened?

452
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,143
What is there?

453
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,408
It's heaven for those
who are starving.

454
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,344
Starving?

455
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:00,540
Starving for what?

456
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,516
You got to be kidding me.

457
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,387
Dad, what will we say..

458
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,513
...if anyone asks where you are.

459
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,583
Bangkok?

460
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:10,352
You don't need to lie.
What's so special about it?

461
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,993
We're going to see
the one-tusk elephant"

462
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,929
...and Buddhist temples.

463
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,022
Is there anything else?

464
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,160
Trip to Bangkok means
characterless certificate.

465
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:20,702
Correct.

466
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,931
O Lord! O Lord! O Lord!

467
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,400
What are you doing?

468
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,943
Brother, if you're going to Bangkok
take sister-in-law along.

469
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,406
Dad, I'll sue you.

470
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,944
Why does a 60 year old
man need to go to Bangkok?

471
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,539
I've never been there, how can you?

472
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,642
Stop that.

473
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:39,549
O Lord! O Lord!

474
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,085
I was going with my friends..

475
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,491
...because the tickets were cheap.

476
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,021
I am not anymore.

477
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,160
HaPPY-

478
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,331
Disgusting.

479
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,436
Embarrassing. Disappointing.

480
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,438
What's wrong?

481
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:01,470
What is he saying?

482
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,304
He's getting furious in English.

483
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,345
Obnoxious.

484
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,411
You're a bachelor.

485
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,210
We've a family.

486
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,285
We need to consider few things.

487
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,654
Why did you get married,
and have kids?

488
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,160
It's futile to make
any plans with you two.

489
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,485
Your spices have made our life hell.

490
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,597
Bollywood heart-throb Akshay Kumar..

491
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,399
...was shooting at Film City"

492
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,473
...when a big horde
of girls charged at him.

493
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,538
Akshay was there to shoot
an ad for Dollar Vests.

494
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,306
But the situation got out of hand..

495
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,506
...and he had to leave
halfway through the shoot.

496
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,709
During this time, Akshay's foot.

497
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,580
...was caught in the door of his car.

498
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:46,316
After which he bashed
up his bodyguard.

499
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,321
The film stars are the
ones who really live it up.

500
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,921
We're nothing compared to them.

501
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:58,327
Akshay's next film's shooting
location will be Mauritius.

502
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,129
...where he'll spend a long time.

503
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,329
Then I'll have to tell Bunty.

504
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,440
He's going there
with daughter-in-law.

505
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,270
For a week.

506
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,068
Mauritius.

507
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,141
Hold on. Bunty. -Yes.

508
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,337
Your Bunty? - Yes.

509
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,745
You see, we export
raw spices to Mauritius.

510
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,545
And our distributer
has sent two invitations.

511
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,683
I mean, for Bunty and his wife.

512
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:22,654
He can even send three.

513
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,924
Yes..

514
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:29,523
Touch!

515
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:30,457
Touch!

516
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,567
Cheers. - Cheers.

517
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:38,330
Bu nty.

518
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,272
Lucky.

519
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,108
Papa, dinner is served.

520
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,613
Papa, white or blue?

521
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,345
Leave that, sit.

522
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,318
Sit here.

523
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:58,325
Bunty, tell Bhanu in Mauritius.

524
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,430
...to send three invites,
instead of two.

525
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,332
No, father. Sonu's still too young.

526
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,627
And there's no point
in taking him along.

527
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,026
He'll spend the week
with his uncle and aunt.

528
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,700
I wasn't talking about Sonu.

529
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:16,006
KD, me and Lali are going
to Mauritius not Ritu and you.

530
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,105
And us?

531
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:21,309
You can go to Ram Nagar
and Jim Corbett National Park.

532
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,511
And you can even visit
Ranchi on your way back.

533
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,120
It's filled with Buddhist temples.

534
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:28,650
What? - Yes.

535
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,756
Go and tell him. - Yes.

536
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,422
Father, blue or white?

537
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,933
You pack the bag.

538
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,527
Yes. - Go.

539
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,432
"Romantic at heart."

540
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,533
"Romantic at heart."

541
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,612
"Romantic at heart."

542
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,195
How do I take this Shilajeet?

543
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,630
You take it with the Holy water.

544
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,667
"I failed university.."

545
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,209
"..cause I was busy being romantic."

546
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:26,745
"I failed university.."

547
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:30,341
"..cause I was busy being romantic."

548
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:34,116
"My pajama string is loose,
everyone knows that."

549
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:37,991
"But I am still busy being romantic."

550
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:41,995
"Now on seeing beauty,
I pull the cheeks."

551
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,660
"I'll throw the net
and catch the fish."

552
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,431
"Now I see the girl and understand."

553
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:53,067
"Whether she will give love
or not at midnight."

554
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,974
"Romantic at heart."

555
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,875
"Romantic at heart."

556
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,075
"We're still romantic at heart."

557
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,315
"Romantic at heart."

558
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,114
"Romantic at heart."

559
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,349
"We're still romantic at heart."

560
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,723
"Romantic at heart."

561
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,518
"Romantic at heart."

562
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,928
"We're still romantic at heart."

563
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,062
"Romantic..at heart."

564
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,795
"Romantic..at heart."

565
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:22,598
"We're still romantic at heart."

566
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,457
Why are you changing in the car?

567
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,321
You could've waited
until we got to Mauritius.

568
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:51,397
Where will we stay in Mauritius?

569
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,430
At a girl's house. - Girl?

570
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,304
He's talking nonsense again.

571
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,667
No nonsense.

572
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,205
I made reservations
over the internet.

573
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,675
I've rented a girl's house.

574
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,006
You..don't believe me.

575
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:02,976
Look.

576
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,778
Look here.

577
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,812
But..will the girl stay with us?

578
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,575
No, she won't. - Then?

579
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,679
Just like we're out on a holiday..

580
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,091
...so is that girl.

581
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,521
But the house will be all ours.

582
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:18,922
What's the point then?

583
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,960
If the girl isn't there"

584
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,126
Whether the girl's there or not..

585
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,531
...but her scent will still be there.

586
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,263
What good's that?

587
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,633
Are you done already?

588
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:34,207
"When the bangles clinker.."

589
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,801
"..and the anklets tinkle."

590
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,612
"When the bangles clinker.."

591
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,661
Seems like we're in Karol Baug.

592
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,299
They're all Indians.

593
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,001
Years ago,
they all migrated here from Bihar..

594
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,008
...and settled down here.
They are all Indians.

595
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,334
But there will be dirty womes, right?
- 200%.

596
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,276
Come on. Hurry up.

597
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,104
You're too slow.

598
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:17,449
Excuse me.

599
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,078
Welcome! Welcome!

600
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,521
Goyal uncle.
Give me the garland.

601
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,256
Welcome!

602
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,416
Welcome, Goyal uncle.

603
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:27,255
Who are you?

604
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,329
I am Bhanu.

605
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,396
Bunty called up and informed me
that you're coming.

606
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,967
We've been making a living
by selling your spices.

607
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,528
How was your journey?

608
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,270
What's this?

609
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,531
That Bunty's sent spies after us.

610
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:39,902
No more fun.

611
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,342
Look, Pinky.

612
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,841
If you like to stay with them..

613
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,211
...then you can. It's okay.

614
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,807
We'll take your leave.

615
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,351
You'll feel homely
in the family atmosphere.

616
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,215
Please take care of him.

617
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,949
No. No..

618
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:58,292
He's our distributor,
he's honoring all of us.

619
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:02,387
You can go ahead,
we'll meet after few days. - No.

620
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,529
This is not done. - Then what?

621
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:05,999
Look, Bhanu.

622
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,332
Text me your number.

623
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,473
We'll definitely
meet before we leave.

624
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,206
Uncle, I thought we'll
have lunch together"

625
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,902
...and show you the temples around.

626
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,736
Next week, our company's sponsoring..

627
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,135
...an event of the Indian Community.

628
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,046
Quiet!

629
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,312
Quiet!

630
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,443
Look, Bhanu. Don't be stubborn.

631
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,054
We don't want to go anywhere.

632
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:30,024
And remember,
if you tell Bunty about this"

633
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,223
...I'll give distribution
to someone else.

634
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,252
Get that? - Yes.

635
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,260
Did you? - Yes.

636
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,157
"Romantic at heart."

637
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:40,561
Call ataxil!

638
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:42,930
"Romantic at heart."

639
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,567
"Romantic at heart."

640
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,735
"Romantic at heart."

641
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,947
"Romantic at heart."

642
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,319
"Romantic at heart."

643
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:02,880
"Romantic at heart."

644
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,228
WOW!

645
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,066
What a beautiful place.

646
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,038
So artistically done.

647
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,229
Thank you.

648
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:19,768
Nice fragrance too.

649
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:23,268
Lali, there's a feminine smell.

650
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,310
Boss..

651
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,076
Look here.

652
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,054
200%.

653
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,857
What we're doing here..

654
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,335
We haven't done anything
don't make me feel guilty already.

655
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,997
You'll get a chance to some action.

656
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:52,332
Today evening?

657
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,067
What's in the evening?

658
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,675
Look, you two have
never been to a strip club.

659
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,075
I have.

660
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,042
In Moscow.

661
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:04,747
I'll take you two
to a strip club here.

662
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:09,356
Until then..keep your vigor at bay.

663
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,046
Is this the place?

664
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,282
It's written right there,
Banana Club.

665
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,318
Why is it so quiet?

666
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,697
Pinky, such clubs are sound-proof.

667
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,529
To contain their wildness.

668
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,737
Let's be a pan of this wildness.

669
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:56,794
Yes come.

670
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,399
Hello.

671
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,078
Normally how much for three?

672
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,406
1000 each.

673
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:07,709
Any discount?

674
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,176
Are you Indian?

675
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,286
You know Hindi?

676
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:12,520
Yes, we're from India.

677
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,852
Give us a discount,
this is our first time.

678
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,257
500 each.

679
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,685
Did you see howl bargained?

680
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:25,867
Why is it so quiet?

681
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:30,197
I am not getting positive
vibes from this place, KD.

682
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,099
It's the best club of Mauritius.

683
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,302
The girls will come out any minute.

684
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:36,776
Babies!

685
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:37,940
Where?

686
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,878
Come, let's settle down.

687
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,182
Come on.

688
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:51,491
Presenting to you,
from Shaukeen company..

689
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,188
...a Bhojpuri song,
in Bollywood style.

690
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,263
Please enjoy.

691
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:02,234
"Youth is on the dance floor."

692
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:08,674
"Youth is on the dance floor."

693
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:12,076
"Sexy female-snakes are
coiled around the rod."

694
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,150
"Shaking every pan of their body."

695
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,777
"Wearing bikini tops."

696
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,118
"This youth is lolly-pop."

697
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,657
If she takes her clothes off..

698
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,892
...I'll lose interest in women.

699
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,429
Let's go. - No.

700
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,160
She's dancing for us.

701
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,692
It'll upset her.

702
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:38,295
"Do mixi-pop in Bhojpuri."

703
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,809
"Do mixi-pop in Bhojpuri."

704
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,777
"Do mixi-pop in Bhojpuri."

705
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,439
What happened? Did you get tired?

706
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:46,607
I think I fell.

707
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,147
Don't worry, I'll get up.

708
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,183
Lali, walk slowly.

709
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,155
The flight to India leaves at 12.

710
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,019
If we're fortunate,
we'll even get tickets.

711
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,583
India? Have you lost your mind?

712
00:36:58,683 --> 00:36:59,593
I am crazy?

713
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,629
Do you see where we are?

714
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,467
This is your red-light area?

715
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,297
In there it seemed like..

716
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,668
...an elephant was dancing
in a sugarcane field.

717
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:13,036
She bent the iron bar. - No, Lali.

718
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:14,369
She wasn't that bad.

719
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:17,469
Hey stupid,
I know how desperate you are.

720
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:21,309
Even English speaking
dogs can turn you on.

721
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,715
You're wrong. - What wrong?

722
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,820
You're wrong. - What wrong?

723
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,479
Hold on. What are you doing?

724
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,179
What are you doing?

725
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,850
Don't judge the book by its cover.

726
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,920
It's a new place,
and our first night.

727
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,425
Let's explore it a bit.

728
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,429
Lali, give it a chance.

729
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:42,402
The night's still young.

730
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,929
Does anyone have a torch?

731
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,947
O Love God, forgive us.

732
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,185
Hail the God of Love.

733
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:00,884
Hail the God of Love.

734
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:02,417
Hail the God of Love.

735
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,484
Hail the God of Love.

736
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,628
Lali. -Who is it?

737
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:22,970
Look.

738
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,270
Pinky.

739
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:46,758
What's going on?

740
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:49,819
He was clicking your pictures?
- Really? Why?

741
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,562
Forgive me, dear.
We're like your father.

742
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,259
He means he was checking..

743
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,463
...if you're the same
person who owns this house.

744
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,400
Yeah, I am.

745
00:39:58,596 --> 00:39:59,404
Ahana.

746
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,007
I am Lali.

747
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,041
Lali.

748
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:06,481
Hi, I am KD. - Hi.

749
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:07,747
These are my friends.

750
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,445
Introduce me. - Okay.

751
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,211
This is Pinky. - Hey, Pinky.

752
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,380
Our third buddy.
He's a bit weak in English.

753
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,880
You didn't have to say that.

754
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,957
That's okay, I know Hindi.

755
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:19,719
No, no, speak in English.

756
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:20,989
One minute.

757
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:24,999
Indian? - Yes.

758
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,894
Guys, I am really sorry I came back.

759
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,495
Actually, I was going
on a road-trip with a friend.

760
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,772
But last minute something happened..

761
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,436
...and I had to cancel my trip.

762
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,912
I know you've paid
for your entire stay.

763
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,141
Technically, you own this place.
- No.

764
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,843
Actually,
I don't want to disturb you.

765
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,114
I can.. I can sleep anywhere.

766
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,220
I can go to my friend's house.

767
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,853
No, no.. - There's no need
to go to your friend's house.

768
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,452
Lali, can I just explain to her? - Okay.

769
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,696
We've no problem
with you staying here.

770
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,995
In fact, we're very happy.

771
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,397
Oh gosh, guys, thank you. - No.

772
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:06,532
You don't need to thank us.
We should be thanking you.

773
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:10,043
You see, you gave us some..

774
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,511
What's it called? - Enjoyment.

775
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,412
Hold on.

776
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,407
We got some refreshment.

777
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,713
I am sorry.
We felt refreshed.

778
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:21,484
Ahana, it's a really sweet name.

779
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,551
Tell us something about yourself.

780
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,453
Well..l am glad you asked.

781
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:32,430
I am..an earth child.

782
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:35,260
What's she saying?
- She's down-to-earth.

783
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:38,497
With gypsy blood.

784
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,105
But I am actually a fashion
designer by profession.

785
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,538
Fashion designer?

786
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,314
Then we'll get along really well.

787
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,783
Because actually,
I am a shoe-designer by profession.

788
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,318
What's your shoe size?

789
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:54,653
No.

790
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,624
Let me guess.

791
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,021
It's 7.

792
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:01,821
How did you..

793
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,193
God, you're good.

794
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:06,762
You are..

795
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,929
Yeah, right. Rich people.

796
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,241
Designer boots..branded ones.

797
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,832
I run a simple NGO.

798
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:16,202
Social service.

799
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:17,678
For women.

800
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,178
A philanthropist.

801
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,014
After I retire,
that's what I am going to do.

802
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:22,741
WOW!

803
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:27,414
I have a business, of raw spices.

804
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:28,885
It's famous all over the world.

805
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,653
And I also own an Audi.

806
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,957
When I look at you,
I get the vibes of a cook.

807
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:36,461
Right?

808
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:43,738
By the way..Lali's married.

809
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,399
My wife's gone to Himalayas.
- Beautiful.

810
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:48,705
He has a kid..

811
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,642
...and he's of marriageable age.

812
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,042
That's not true.

813
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,539
That's so sweet.

814
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:56,341
Anyway, do you guys want to see
some of my creations?

815
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,382
Sure!

816
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,852
This is my workshop. How is it?

817
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:03,687
Well, it's a little..

818
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,556
All this stuff is recycled.

819
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:10,195
Unique, just like you.

820
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:11,025
Thanks.

821
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,964
I'll show you some of my designs.

822
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,203
Look at this.

823
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,339
Men's Jacket,
made from a dead monkey.

824
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,636

00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,602
And..
Excuse me.

826
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:24,677

00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,309

Thank you very much?

830
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:31,282

831
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:32,284
It's beautiful.

Made from frog's eye.

836
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,763
You're a very..unusual designer.

837
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:48,465
Please keep quiet.

838
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,335
What he's trying to say is that
it's a very unconventional design.

839
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:56,408
So..people buy lot of your obnoxious"
I mean unique designs, right?

840
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:01,080
Actually, I am way ahead of my time.

841
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,717
Most people think it's very cruel.

842
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:07,582
No, no, no. It is a great artwork.

843
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:08,779
Brilliant.

844
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,415

I need to upload this on FB.

858
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,449
But on one condition.

859
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,586
You have to..

00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,764

00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,913
"Everything seems upside down."

870
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,988
"Take a puff..it's Manali's stuff."

Don't know why?

895
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,878
200% it's the Shilajeet.

896
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,053
Why will Shilajeet
give me a headache?

897
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,819
Pinky's ignorant.

898
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:40,118
But what made you
take this cheap stuff?

899
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,892
I was just trying it.

900
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,024
But where is he?

901
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:47,601
Pinky.

902
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,336
Rascal. - No, no.

903
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:52,340
Bloody pervert.
- Lali, you misunderstand me.

904
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,270
Ahana, I'll save
you from this savage.

905
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,607
You rascal.

906
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:59,136
People like you humiliate India.

907
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,746
Leave me, it's not him.

908
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:02,542
Then who?

909
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,253
It's him. -You did it.

910
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,377
Him, you idiot. Him.

911
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:09,686
It's him.

912
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:12,356
Oh..

913
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,827
Thank God. We misunderstood.

914
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:16,990
Sorry, Pinky.

915
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:18,695
Sorry, we blundered.

916
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,234
You were wearing a towel, and..

917
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,263
When I have promised..
- There would be a problem because of you.

918
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:25,238
Stop it!

919
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,533
All of you out!

920
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,871
You guyS are Pigs-

921
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,439
All men are pigs.

922
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,472
Get out! All of you!

923
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:35,513
Ahana.

924
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,514
We're..

925
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,152
We're really very sorry.

926
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,923
It was just misunderstanding.

927
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:48,353
I broke up with Kunal, my boyfriend.

928
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,630
You've a boyfriend? - She had.

929
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:51,629
Broke up.

930
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:55,530
I had planned this
road trip with him.

931
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,798
And stitched a special
outfit for him.

932
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:01,073
But..he made fun of my creation.

933
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,806
He said it was stupid and obnoxious.

934
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:08,905
Yesterday,
I invited my so called friends..

935
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,283
...so that they'll
make me feel better.

936
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,486
<i>But those ham.</i>

937
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,087
They came to my party.

938
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,419
Drank my alcohol.

939
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:18,653
And now they're liking
my ex-boyfriend's pictures on FB.

940
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,451
I've just 11 likes on my status.

941
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,792
...and he has 43.

942
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,500
Baby, let me give you a hug.

943
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,634
You need the warmth.

944
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,036
I don't know why I am discussing..

945
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:34,598
...my personal life with all of you.

946
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:36,536
We really don't know each other.

947
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,403
Don't say that.

948
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,716
We don't just share
a physical relation.

949
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,113
But we also have a
emotional relationship.

950
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,745
Feel it.

951
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:49,753
He's getting too close.

952
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:51,918
Take your hands off.

953
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,529
Ahana, come here.

954
00:50:55,018 --> 00:51:00,229
If you keep crying like this,
you'll wet your dress.

955
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,428
Let her cry.

956
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:04,597
It'll lighten her mind and body.

957
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:09,105
You know what..you're right, Lali.

958
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,210
I won't cry.

959
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,341
In fact, I'll decide something today.

960
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,241
I will never again
take anyone of my age.

961
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:17,678
There's no maturity.

962
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,586
My next boyfriend will be..

963
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,387
...at least 10 years elder to me.

964
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,119
I think 25 will be better.

965
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,690
Think big.

966
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:30,697
But we fall in that category. Right?

967
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:33,668
Why not? I can take anyone of you.

968
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:35,866
What's she saying?

969
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,198
Line's clear, boy.

970
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:40,867
I did everything
in our 2 year relationship.

971
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:45,041
Kunal never even asked
me for a glass of water.

972
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:49,583
Ahana. Would you
like a glass of water?

973
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,210
Lali, you're a sweetheart.

974
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,312
Water's one thing" Move.

975
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,248
What?
- Come on, move.

976
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,290
Water's one thing,
and this closeness is one thing.

977
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,527
200% it will work.

978
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:08,295
You know, Lali..he used
to make me clean this house.

979
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:12,702
What are you doing?

980
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,300
We're in a live-in too.

981
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,870
You guys are so sweet.

982
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,346
You know what,
I felt so much better now.

983
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:23,007
I need some fresh air.

984
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,375
Let's hit the beach.

985
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,578
I need my bikini.

986
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:26,551
Bikini?

987
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,623
You mean..two piece?

988
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,615
You don't expect me to go naked.

989
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,024
Stupid.

990
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:38,089
Don't just stand there, get ready.

991
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:40,595
Should I take the Shilajeet?

992
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:54,843
Hello. What's that? - Underwear.

993
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,452
You expect me to wear
pajamas to the beach?

994
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,210
Didn't you bring swimming trunks?

995
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:02,519
No, those nylon trunks make me itchy.

996
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:04,023
I'll disown him in public.

997
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:04,752
Hey"

998
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:07,727
You knew we were going to Mauritius.

999
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,694
It's filled with beaches..

1000
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:12,629
...so why didn't you
bring swimming trunks?

1001
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:14,699
Should I wear my pajamas?

1002
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:16,394
We'll have to leave him here. - No.

1003
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:18,302
He's right. - No.

1004
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,102
I want to see Ahana in bikini.

1005
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:21,737
I beg you, please.

1006
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,775
Don't be stubborn like a kid.

1007
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,574
We'll take a picture and show you.

1008
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:28,809
Photo is no good.

1009
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,922
Ahana, what is this?
What happened?

1010
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,818
What are you wearing?

1011
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:40,488
Where's your bikini?

1012
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,652
It's exactly what I feared.

1013
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,788
Kunal is dating Tara Shah.

1014
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,964
It's on their FB, their relationship.

1015
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,503
And both were partying
at the Buddha bar last night.

1016
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:51,969
50 people like this status.

1017
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:54,572
And 40 of them are my own friends.

1018
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,971
I want to kill myself.

1019
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,909
Please don't. - Hold on.

1020
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,848
Come on, let's go to
the beach and talk, dear.

1021
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,349
Mister" - I mean Ahana.

1022
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,615
Wear your bikini.

1023
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,884
The cool breeze will
calm your mind and body.

1024
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:12,557
I don't want to go anywhere.

1025
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:14,559
I am in a very bad mood.

1026
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:18,665
Oh my, God.

1027
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,131
And 20 more likes.

1028
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:26,505
Where are you going?

1029
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:29,271
To kill myself and don't follow me.

1030
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:31,374
Wear your bikini.

1031
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,074
"In the lonely days.."

1032
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:39,747
"In the lonely nights, I miss you.."

1033
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:43,956
"Lonely..Lonely.."

1034
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:48,128
"My heart's burning for you."

1035
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,729
"Day-Night I am crying for you."

1036
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,295
"Why did you leave me?"

1037
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,325
"Why did you leave me?"

1038
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,895
"In the lonely days.."

1039
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:03,306
"In the lonely nights, I miss you.."

1040
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,923
"I've no buddy."

1041
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:22,627
"I'm so lonely."

1042
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:26,629
"Your memories haunt
me all the time."

1043
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,996
"In the lonely days.."

1044
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:35,533
"In the lonely nights, I miss you.."

1045
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,708
"In the lonely days.."

1046
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:46,652
"In the lonely nights, I miss you.."

1047
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,915
"Miss you.. - I am lonely-lonely."

1048
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:54,551
"Miss you.. - I am lonely-lonely."

1049
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,358
"Miss you.. - I am lonely-lonely."

1050
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,900
"Miss you.. - I am lonely-lonely."

1051
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,261
I will kill myself.

1052
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:15,843
Take 3!

1053
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:20,721
That's me.

1054
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:22,414
Coming up next is a close-up of me.

1055
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,287
Just watch"

1056
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,554
...how my appearance changes
this story completely

1057
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,769
"He was small when
I brought him home."

1058
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,635
"Fed him milk myself."

1059
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:42,232
"He was a sweet, cute little pup."

1060
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,276
"I made him a bulldog."

1061
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,109
"Then he showed his real color."

1062
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:49,276
"One day his collar was loose."

1063
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:53,113
"He ran after me."

1064
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:56,890
"He bit me so hard on my back."

1065
00:56:57,213 --> 00:57:00,319
"Love is a dog."

1066
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:04,026
"Love is a dog."

1067
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:07,535
"Love is a dog."

1068
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,796
"Love is a dog."

1069
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:30,152
"A beautiful girl
taught me a lesson."

1070
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,955
"I forgot all my duties.."

1071
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:34,186
"..but she turned out to be a liar."

1072
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:41,193
"A beautiful girl
taught me a lesson."

1073
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,066
"I forgot all my duties.."

1074
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,037
"..but she turned out to be a liar."

1075
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:46,697
"She had bowled me over.."

1076
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,765
"..by writing a love
letter with her blood."

1077
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:50,468
"I would live and die for love."

1078
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:52,513
"I had made him the God of my love."

1079
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:55,573
"Till now how many
shoulders he has sat on."

1080
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:59,845
"He has pissed in every lover's ear."

1081
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,957
"Love is a dog."

1082
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:07,016
"Love is a dog."

1083
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:10,230
"Love is a dog."

1084
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,899
"Love is a dog."

1085
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:18,730
"Love is a dog."

1086
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:36,449
"She built her dreams
on the tomb of my desires."

1087
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:40,493
"She fooled me and dumped me."

1088
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,661
"She built her dreams
on the tomb of my desires."

1089
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:51,570
"She fooled me and dumped me."

1090
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:55,269
"I would save every penny
to pay for her leisure."

1091
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,938
"I would take her to
multiplex to show her film."

1092
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:02,140
"You'll regret it one day too."

1093
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:06,182
"You'll sing this song one day too."

1094
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:09,390
"Love is a dog."

1095
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,616
"Love is a dog."

1096
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,731
"Love is a dog."

1097
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,424
"Love is a dog."

1098
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:24,128
"Love is a dog."

1099
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:26,102
"Love is a dog."

1100
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,279
Right, love is a dog
and men are romantic at heart.

1101
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:40,447
If your desires have awakened too"

1102
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:42,418
...then fulfill them.

1103
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,489
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

1104
00:59:50,517 --> 00:59:52,326
Excuse me, have you seen?

1105
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,821
No.

1106
00:59:54,087 --> 00:59:56,567
"In the lonely days.."

1107
00:59:56,657 --> 01:00:02,573
"In the lonely nights,
I miss you.."

1108
01:00:02,663 --> 01:00:04,574
"Lonely..Lonely.."

1109
01:00:05,065 --> 01:00:06,544
"lam Lonely..Lonely.."

1110
01:00:07,401 --> 01:00:09,904
"In the lonely days.."

1111
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:16,077
"In the lonely nights,
I miss you.."

1112
01:00:18,111 --> 01:00:20,557
"In the lonely days.."

1113
01:00:20,681 --> 01:00:26,529
"In the lonely nights,
I miss you.."

1114
01:00:37,397 --> 01:00:38,603
"Miss you."

1115
01:00:38,732 --> 01:00:40,006
"Lonely..Lonely.."

1116
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,044
"Miss you."

1117
01:00:41,134 --> 01:00:42,613
"lam Lonely..Lonely.."

1118
01:00:42,736 --> 01:00:44,044
"Miss you."

1119
01:00:44,137 --> 01:00:45,343
"Lonely..Lonely.."

1120
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,349
"Miss you."

1121
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,249
"lam Lonely..Lonely.."

1122
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:55,023
I wonder where she is.

1123
01:00:56,416 --> 01:00:58,623
Did she actually commit suicide?

1124
01:00:58,919 --> 01:00:59,954
Don't say that?

1125
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:03,661
You two hugged her,
I didn't even touch her.

1126
01:01:04,424 --> 01:01:08,463
I mean we didn't
get to know each other.

1127
01:01:09,563 --> 01:01:11,440
If anything happens to her,
we'll be in a mess.

1128
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,011
Everyone knows we stay with her.

1129
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:18,071
Come on.

1130
01:01:19,506 --> 01:01:20,985
Let's pack.

1131
01:01:21,341 --> 01:01:23,514
We'll leave for India.
- I'll book the tickets.

1132
01:01:23,577 --> 01:01:29,653
"You're my sanctity."

1133
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,190
Ahana. - Come on.

1134
01:01:33,053 --> 01:01:34,054
Baby.

1135
01:01:34,154 --> 01:01:35,929
Andi, I have to meet Akshay Kumar.

1136
01:01:36,023 --> 01:01:37,297
I don't care what you do?

1137
01:01:37,391 --> 01:01:39,667
You have such a big event
management company.

1138
01:01:39,927 --> 01:01:41,634
I am sure you can
work something out.

1139
01:01:42,029 --> 01:01:43,667
Okay. Thanks.
I'll call you later.

1140
01:01:44,564 --> 01:01:45,565
Bye.

1141
01:01:48,635 --> 01:01:51,081
Ahana. - Oh my, God.

1142
01:01:51,171 --> 01:01:53,173
You guys will not
believe what happened.

1143
01:01:53,273 --> 01:01:54,877
We were really scared.

1144
01:01:54,975 --> 01:01:56,613
Thank God, my baby.

1145
01:01:56,877 --> 01:01:57,787
I am so haPPY-

1146
01:01:57,878 --> 01:01:59,323
Let her go.

1147
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,984
But what happened, Ahana?

1148
01:02:01,081 --> 01:02:03,061
It was like a dream
come true, Lali.

1149
01:02:03,183 --> 01:02:05,322
I saw Akshay in person.

1150
01:02:05,419 --> 01:02:06,397
He's in Mauritius.

1151
01:02:06,486 --> 01:02:07,863
I see. - We heard that too.

1152
01:02:07,955 --> 01:02:08,990
And you didn't tell me.

1153
01:02:09,189 --> 01:02:11,135
We didn't know you're
such a big fan.

1154
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:12,063
Fan?

1155
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:14,537
Dude. He's half my life.

1156
01:02:15,362 --> 01:02:16,466
Look.

1157
01:02:19,399 --> 01:02:21,504
Some like collecting stamps.

1158
01:02:21,601 --> 01:02:22,909
...and some like collecting coins.

1159
01:02:23,136 --> 01:02:25,207
Mine..is Akshay Kumar.

1160
01:02:25,605 --> 01:02:26,845
Akshay Kumar's photo.

1161
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,216
He's the one who inspired
me to become a designer.

1162
01:02:30,877 --> 01:02:31,753
Engagement photo?

1163
01:02:31,812 --> 01:02:32,790
I love him.

1164
01:02:32,879 --> 01:02:34,586
I even went to Mumbai to meet him.

1165
01:02:34,848 --> 01:02:35,849
But nothing happened.

1166
01:02:36,016 --> 01:02:37,927
It's very difficult to meet him.

1167
01:02:38,085 --> 01:02:41,157
Are you so desperate
for Akshay Kumar?

1168
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:44,594
Desperate?

1169
01:02:45,525 --> 01:02:47,835
Dude. If someone
introduces me to Akshay..

1170
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:50,238
...I will do anything for him.
I mean..

1171
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:52,332
Who do I have to sleep
with to meet Akshay?

1172
01:02:52,499 --> 01:02:54,206
I am so excited.

1173
01:03:02,642 --> 01:03:05,486
"Who do I have to sleep
with to meet Akshay."

1174
01:03:08,982 --> 01:03:11,121
She can do anything to meet Akshay.

1175
01:03:12,986 --> 01:03:15,523
I guess she didn't mean it. - No.

1176
01:03:15,622 --> 01:03:16,396
She meant it.

1177
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:18,436
She'll do what she said.

1178
01:03:18,558 --> 01:03:20,538
200%. - Really?

1179
01:03:48,155 --> 01:03:49,600
Indian? - Move aside.

1180
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:00,407
Hello, Indian.

1181
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,706
Move aside.

1182
01:04:05,372 --> 01:04:07,318
Indian? - Yes.

1183
01:04:07,874 --> 01:04:09,251
Want to meet Akshay Kumar?

1184
01:04:09,342 --> 01:04:13,654
No. Not me. But my friend does.

1185
01:04:18,819 --> 01:04:20,264
Good morning, Ahana.

1186
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:22,058
What's so good about this morning?

1187
01:04:22,155 --> 01:04:24,294
Right in the morning.

1188
01:04:24,391 --> 01:04:26,166
My baby. Let me give you a hug.

1189
01:04:26,259 --> 01:04:27,567
Please KD, not now.

1190
01:04:27,661 --> 01:04:29,538
Andi's not answering his phone.

1191
01:04:29,896 --> 01:04:32,137
He promised to
introduce me to Akshay.

1192
01:04:32,632 --> 01:04:33,633
Bloody liar.

1193
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,677
Ahana, have you seen Lali?

1194
01:04:35,902 --> 01:04:37,404
Forget about Lali.

1195
01:04:37,604 --> 01:04:38,344
Come on, Ahana.

1196
01:04:38,438 --> 01:04:39,439
Don't spoil your mood.

1197
01:04:39,606 --> 01:04:42,052
Listen to me. Get into bikini mood.

1198
01:04:42,142 --> 01:04:43,143
And we'll hit the beach.

1199
01:04:43,243 --> 01:04:44,620
It'll change your mood too.

1200
01:04:44,945 --> 01:04:46,356
What about Akshay? - Relax.

1201
01:04:46,446 --> 01:04:47,618
I am there.

1202
01:04:47,981 --> 01:04:49,324
We will hit the beach.

1203
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:51,919
And we'll have
breakfast at the beach.

1204
01:04:52,018 --> 01:04:55,625
Ratatouille.
Baked beans. Focaccia bread.

1205
01:04:55,889 --> 01:04:57,232
Muffins and whipped cream.

1206
01:04:57,324 --> 01:04:59,497
And..pumpkin pie.

1207
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,905
KD. - Yeah.

1208
01:05:02,129 --> 01:05:03,107
Where's Lali?

1209
01:05:03,196 --> 01:05:07,440
Forget about Lali,
go get your swimming trunks.

1210
01:05:10,237 --> 01:05:11,238
I'll introduce you to him.

1211
01:05:11,371 --> 01:05:14,113
I'll even get you popcorn and cold
drink outside the Akshay's tent.

1212
01:05:14,207 --> 01:05:15,208
Thank you, son.

1213
01:05:15,642 --> 01:05:19,522
You're doing so much for me.
It's overwhelming.

1214
01:05:20,547 --> 01:05:23,084
Uncle..l am not doing this for you.

1215
01:05:23,383 --> 01:05:24,453
It will cost you.

1216
01:05:24,518 --> 01:05:25,963
100,000 per person.

1217
01:05:26,253 --> 01:05:28,631
I want to meet Akshay Kumar,
not the Prime Minister.

1218
01:05:28,755 --> 01:05:30,962
You can meet the
Prime Minister for free.

1219
01:05:31,024 --> 01:05:32,469
You're meeting Akshay Kumar.

1220
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,869
Take it or leave it.
- Okay, I will take it.

1221
01:05:36,963 --> 01:05:39,705
Cash or card? - Cash.

1222
01:05:40,133 --> 01:05:43,945
The pink one's nice.
- The blue one is better.

1223
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:45,572
No way.

1224
01:05:45,906 --> 01:05:50,048
Blue bikini, blue ocean,
blue sky..and more blue..

1225
01:05:50,143 --> 01:05:51,053
It's too much blue.

1226
01:05:51,144 --> 01:05:52,145
Pink is better.

1227
01:05:52,212 --> 01:05:53,919
It should cover the body too.

1228
01:05:54,314 --> 01:05:56,294
Her body's like..

1229
01:05:57,184 --> 01:05:58,629
Okay, okay..

1230
01:05:59,252 --> 01:06:01,630
We'll try both one by one.

1231
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,856
Finally.

1232
01:06:04,157 --> 01:06:06,330
Andi, where the hell are you?

1233
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,632
It's not Andi, its Lali speaking.

1234
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:12,007
Hey Lali, where are you?

1235
01:06:12,098 --> 01:06:13,202
We're going to the beach.

1236
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:17,007
Forget the beach,
listen to me carefully.

1237
01:06:17,304 --> 01:06:19,648
Are KD and Pinky with you?

1238
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:21,317
Yeah, they're right here with me.

1239
01:06:21,408 --> 01:06:23,319
Don't repeat what I'm about to say.

1240
01:06:24,344 --> 01:06:25,789
I am on Akshay Kumar's set.

1241
01:06:25,912 --> 01:06:28,825
Are you serious? How?

1242
01:06:28,915 --> 01:06:30,553
If you want to meet Akshay Kumar..

1243
01:06:31,017 --> 01:06:32,360
...then come immediately on the set.

1244
01:06:32,953 --> 01:06:35,126
I'll text you the address.

1245
01:06:35,889 --> 01:06:37,493
Really?
Pinky, pinch me.

1246
01:06:39,092 --> 01:06:40,969
I can't believe it.
- Shall I do it again?

1247
01:06:41,361 --> 01:06:44,001
Lali, you're the best.

1248
01:06:44,164 --> 01:06:44,835
I'm coming.

1249
01:06:44,931 --> 01:06:47,468
Listen, the shooting's
about to begin.

1250
01:06:47,701 --> 01:06:50,511
And listen,
don't tell KD and Pinky about this.

1251
01:06:51,104 --> 01:06:52,105
O Kay; bye'

1252
01:06:55,275 --> 01:06:56,549
Oh my, God.

1253
01:06:56,977 --> 01:06:58,513
You guys carry on to the beach..

1254
01:06:58,612 --> 01:07:01,149
...and I'll see you later.

1255
01:07:06,286 --> 01:07:09,893
Pinky..something's wrong.

1256
01:07:10,557 --> 01:07:15,870
Lali calls and she..hops,
skips and jumps to him.

1257
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,304
Lali.

1258
01:07:21,768 --> 01:07:22,872
Lali.

1259
01:07:22,969 --> 01:07:23,879
Lali.

1260
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:25,074
Let her through.

1261
01:07:26,473 --> 01:07:27,747
Let her through.
What are you doing?

1262
01:07:27,907 --> 01:07:29,318
Oh my God, Lali you..

1263
01:07:29,409 --> 01:07:30,649
I can't believe this"

1264
01:07:30,977 --> 01:07:31,978
Thank you.

1265
01:07:33,913 --> 01:07:35,085
Have a cold drink.

1266
01:07:35,348 --> 01:07:36,383
It's from Akshay's fridge.

1267
01:07:36,549 --> 01:07:37,550
Sir, who is this?

1268
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:39,921
She wants her picture taken.

1269
01:07:40,487 --> 01:07:42,524
My friend. - I can understand.

1270
01:07:42,622 --> 01:07:43,657
I can't believe this.

1271
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:45,663
I am sitting outside
Akshay's makeup room.

1272
01:07:46,526 --> 01:07:48,403
And sipping soft drink
from his fridge. - Of course.

1273
01:07:49,562 --> 01:07:51,064
I got to put this on FB.

1274
01:07:54,868 --> 01:07:59,214
Lali..deceived me. -You?

1275
01:08:00,273 --> 01:08:01,274
With us?

1276
01:08:01,841 --> 01:08:05,914
Pinky, you're not a
contender in Ahana's case.

1277
01:08:06,546 --> 01:08:07,547
Why not?

1278
01:08:07,914 --> 01:08:09,916
I am a man too, a pervert.

1279
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:11,256
And shameless, like you two.

1280
01:08:11,351 --> 01:08:13,524
I am a contender too.

1281
01:08:18,692 --> 01:08:23,573
My bro..hold it
like this and zoom in.

1282
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:25,309
That's when you'll
get the VIP shot.

1283
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:36,050
Are you filming me? - No.

1284
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:38,480
Candid shoot.

1285
01:08:38,812 --> 01:08:40,018
Please don't delete that.

1286
01:08:40,113 --> 01:08:41,251
This video is all I have.

1287
01:08:41,314 --> 01:08:43,055
You perverts. - No..

1288
01:08:43,149 --> 01:08:46,130
No, we are needy, hungry..

1289
01:08:46,386 --> 01:08:47,558
Where's Akshay?

1290
01:08:47,887 --> 01:08:48,888
Out buying a sari.

1291
01:08:49,022 --> 01:08:50,831
Sir, he's Akshay Kumar.

1292
01:08:50,924 --> 01:08:52,164
You will have to wait.

1293
01:08:52,258 --> 01:08:53,601
He won't just enter like this.

1294
01:08:53,693 --> 01:08:54,967
Action.

1295
01:10:05,498 --> 01:10:07,671
Cut it!

1296
01:10:07,834 --> 01:10:08,608
Cut it!

1297
01:10:08,668 --> 01:10:14,380
What a fantabulous shot! Superb!

1298
01:10:21,247 --> 01:10:23,693
Mind-blowing, Akki. What a shot.

1299
01:10:23,983 --> 01:10:25,189
You gave me goose-bumps.

1300
01:10:25,285 --> 01:10:27,128
See for yourself.
Would you like to see the monitor?

1301
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:28,255
Anything wrong with the shot?

1302
01:10:28,354 --> 01:10:30,493
It's a promo shot.

1303
01:10:30,557 --> 01:10:31,968
Then why do I need to see it?

1304
01:10:32,659 --> 01:10:34,229
I haven't been doing anything
else for the last 20 years.

1305
01:10:34,327 --> 01:10:36,500
Climbing up and down
the helicopter. What else.

1306
01:10:36,763 --> 01:10:38,970
Kuku, get my coconut water.

1307
01:10:41,234 --> 01:10:42,235
Thank you.

1308
01:10:42,969 --> 01:10:44,710
It's too light.

1309
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:46,275
Make it properly.

1310
01:10:46,706 --> 01:10:48,208
I got goose-bumps.

1311
01:10:48,475 --> 01:10:49,476
Touch it.

1312
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:58,358
It's better now.

1313
01:10:58,451 --> 01:11:00,556
Always make it strong.
It should give me that feeling.

1314
01:11:01,855 --> 01:11:02,925
Akshay, help.

1315
01:11:04,991 --> 01:11:07,130
Akshay. - What happened?

1316
01:11:07,427 --> 01:11:08,963
Akshay sir, just a minute.

1317
01:11:09,062 --> 01:11:10,234
Just a small endorsement.

1318
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:12,003
He's the biggest
builder of Mauritius.

1319
01:11:12,098 --> 01:11:13,372
Kishore Samtani. Shake hands.

1320
01:11:13,466 --> 01:11:15,343
No, no, that will cost extra.

1321
01:11:15,435 --> 01:11:18,473
Hurry up, quickly. Fast.

1322
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:20,107
Take a picture.

1323
01:11:20,206 --> 01:11:21,048
Just three pictures.

1324
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:21,880
One.

1325
01:11:21,975 --> 01:11:22,976
One more, sir.

1326
01:11:23,142 --> 01:11:24,553
Very good.
Last one.

1327
01:11:24,644 --> 01:11:25,679
Very good.
Last one.

1328
01:11:25,912 --> 01:11:27,050
Very good.

1329
01:11:27,146 --> 01:11:28,454
Don't forget the check.

1330
01:11:28,548 --> 01:11:29,652
Where are you going, sir?

1331
01:11:29,849 --> 01:11:30,850
One more endorsement.

1332
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:32,054
Come, baby. Come forward.

1333
01:11:32,118 --> 01:11:34,098
She's from the most famous
restaurant in Mauritius.

1334
01:11:34,287 --> 01:11:36,961
Two photos.
Fast. With her.

1335
01:11:38,324 --> 01:11:41,601
The lobster eating pose.
That's always good.

1336
01:11:41,694 --> 01:11:43,173
She's the owner's girlfriend.

1337
01:11:43,296 --> 01:11:44,400
She wanted to be in the frame.

1338
01:11:44,497 --> 01:11:45,669
No, I am a lesbian.

1339
01:11:45,732 --> 01:11:46,733
What?

1340
01:11:46,933 --> 01:11:49,311
The things these
people say these days.

1341
01:11:49,402 --> 01:11:51,905
Anyway, last endorsement.
Mauritius International School.

1342
01:11:52,005 --> 01:11:53,916
Come on, kids.
Sir doesn't have time.

1343
01:11:53,973 --> 01:11:55,975
Take a picture with few kids.

1344
01:11:56,242 --> 01:11:57,186
And that's it.

1345
01:11:57,277 --> 01:11:58,779
Let's go quickly.
Come on, kids.

1346
01:12:00,413 --> 01:12:02,620
Smile. Smile.
Go back to school.

1347
01:12:02,782 --> 01:12:03,954
School is open.
Go back to school.

1348
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:05,393
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

1349
01:12:05,485 --> 01:12:06,293
Very good.

1350
01:12:06,386 --> 01:12:08,457
We are going to make lots of money
but one final endorsement.

1351
01:12:08,555 --> 01:12:10,000
This is the best one. - I am tired.

1352
01:12:10,223 --> 01:12:11,702
Sir.. - I am tired.

1353
01:12:11,758 --> 01:12:14,068
Akshay Kumar, I hate you.

1354
01:12:15,962 --> 01:12:17,168
But the world loves you.

1355
01:12:17,297 --> 01:12:18,503
The world loves you.

1356
01:12:18,598 --> 01:12:20,373
Shall I make the call?
Final endorsement.

1357
01:12:20,934 --> 01:12:22,311
Hello. Vipin.

1358
01:12:22,435 --> 01:12:24,142
Hold on.
He's in a bad mood..

1359
01:12:24,404 --> 01:12:25,542
...it's the heroine's fault.

1360
01:12:25,605 --> 01:12:26,913
I don't know what happened.

1361
01:12:47,226 --> 01:12:48,534
No, I've not seen your pictures.

1362
01:12:48,628 --> 01:12:49,902
I told you I don't
want to see your pictures.

1363
01:12:49,996 --> 01:12:51,339
Please hold.

1364
01:12:51,664 --> 01:12:53,109
Oh God.

1365
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:55,237
The world's cheapest,
lowest director"

1366
01:12:55,335 --> 01:12:56,837
"Baljeet Basu's calling, sir.
- Give me the phone.

1367
01:12:56,936 --> 01:12:57,914
Should I say no?

1368
01:12:58,004 --> 01:12:59,176
Give me the phone.

1369
01:12:59,539 --> 01:13:00,540
Hold this.

1370
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:02,542
No, sir.. - Sir.

1371
01:13:02,675 --> 01:13:03,949
Sir, Akshay Kumar speaking.

1372
01:13:04,344 --> 01:13:05,345
Yes, sir.

1373
01:13:06,245 --> 01:13:07,952
Sir, I am completely prepared.

1374
01:13:08,381 --> 01:13:09,382
Just come see me.

1375
01:13:09,682 --> 01:13:10,683
Yes, sir.

1376
01:13:10,783 --> 01:13:13,195
That chart is all ready.

1377
01:13:13,486 --> 01:13:15,363
Your Shubojeet is
getting ready, sir.

1378
01:13:16,656 --> 01:13:17,657
Ask me anything.

1379
01:13:18,024 --> 01:13:19,332
<i>Fear.</i>

1380
01:13:20,827 --> 01:13:21,897
Ridicule.

1381
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:25,302
Disgust.

1382
01:13:30,203 --> 01:13:31,443
I am eagerly waiting for you, sir.

1383
01:13:31,571 --> 01:13:33,016
Please come. Okay, sir.

1384
01:13:33,106 --> 01:13:34,107
See you. Bye.

1385
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:37,048
Sir, please.
don't waste your time with him.

1386
01:13:37,143 --> 01:13:38,383
He's completely mad.
Don't waste time.

1387
01:13:38,478 --> 01:13:41,015
A Bengali director
needs a Bengali actor.

1388
01:13:41,114 --> 01:13:43,094
I'll call Mr.
Rahul Bose, he's free these days.

1389
01:13:43,182 --> 01:13:44,286
Stop it.

1390
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:45,520
Stop it right now.

1391
01:13:46,085 --> 01:13:48,224
Do you know the director
you're talking about?

1392
01:13:48,354 --> 01:13:50,095
Yes. - He's won 5 National Awards.

1393
01:13:50,189 --> 01:13:51,862
5.. - 5 National Awards.

1394
01:13:52,058 --> 01:13:55,062
He's Akshay Kumar's
ticket to National Award.

1395
01:13:55,161 --> 01:13:56,367
Imagine your boss..

1396
01:13:56,663 --> 01:13:58,301
His photograph,
National Award winner.

1397
01:13:58,398 --> 01:13:59,399
Akshay Kumar.

1398
01:13:59,499 --> 01:14:02,810
Sir, what good will
a National Award do?

1399
01:14:02,902 --> 01:14:03,710
Tell me honestly.

1400
01:14:03,736 --> 01:14:05,374
Two minute interview
on the National channel.

1401
01:14:05,471 --> 01:14:07,246
Waste of time. - Shut up.

1402
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:10,878
Your focus should
be on the 200 crores club.

1403
01:14:10,943 --> 01:14:12,286
You must look there, sir.

1404
01:14:12,412 --> 01:14:13,891
You are a star.

1405
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,081
You're a champion.

1406
01:14:15,181 --> 01:14:16,319
You're a Khiladi (Player).

1407
01:14:16,382 --> 01:14:18,259
Don't do that, sir. Don't do that.

1408
01:14:18,351 --> 01:14:19,921
You're looking very unnatural, sir.

1409
01:14:19,986 --> 01:14:21,624
You're number 1.
You're the Khiladi.

1410
01:14:21,854 --> 01:14:23,561
You're the no.1 Akshay Kumar.

1411
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:24,896
No.2..Salman Khan.

1412
01:14:24,991 --> 01:14:26,061
No.3..Shahrukh Khan.

1413
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:29,197
No.4.. Jacky Bhagnani.

1414
01:14:29,295 --> 01:14:30,103
He's catching up.

1415
01:14:30,196 --> 01:14:30,833
I'm worried.

1416
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:32,432
Jacky Bhagnani is catching up.

1417
01:14:32,532 --> 01:14:34,705
It's a flop!
Wonderful.

1418
01:14:35,702 --> 01:14:36,703
Flop.

1419
01:14:37,537 --> 01:14:40,313
What kind of a title
is Kerala Charlie for a film?

1420
01:14:42,341 --> 01:14:44,651
Who cares if it's a good film?

1421
01:14:44,944 --> 01:14:46,890
Good films are only meant for DVD.

1422
01:14:47,447 --> 01:14:49,859
Right..call me later.

1423
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:51,622
John's film..

1424
01:14:52,285 --> 01:14:53,923
The reports are mixed. - Mixed?

1425
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:55,192
Tell me something.

1426
01:14:55,488 --> 01:14:57,331
You can't tolerate
to see others happy?

1427
01:14:57,590 --> 01:15:00,901
Akki, lfeel really
sad when a film flops.

1428
01:15:00,993 --> 01:15:01,994
Really?

1429
01:15:02,261 --> 01:15:03,296
I swear.

1430
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:05,773
I swear on that light.

1431
01:15:09,268 --> 01:15:10,269
Hello.

1432
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:11,571
Yes.

1433
01:15:12,004 --> 01:15:13,005
What?

1434
01:15:13,973 --> 01:15:15,509
No show in Satara.

1435
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:17,710
Yes.

1436
01:15:18,177 --> 01:15:20,623
Tell me Dubai's
collection by tonight.

1437
01:15:21,581 --> 01:15:22,651
Fine, I'll call you later.

1438
01:15:24,884 --> 01:15:26,591
It won't even do 100 crores.

1439
01:15:26,786 --> 01:15:28,766
We'll do it, sir. We'll do it.

1440
01:15:28,955 --> 01:15:30,195
I have everything planned.

1441
01:15:30,289 --> 01:15:33,133
We'll host a big event
with the Indian Community here.

1442
01:15:33,192 --> 01:15:34,535
We'll make 200 crores..

1443
01:15:34,627 --> 01:15:36,470
300 crores at least.

1444
01:15:36,696 --> 01:15:39,199
No, this time we'll cross 400..
- Shut up..

1445
01:15:39,298 --> 01:15:40,777
<i>100, 200, 300 crates.</i>

1446
01:15:41,434 --> 01:15:42,913
You two are driving me nuts.

1447
01:15:43,402 --> 01:15:44,676
I am fed up of this.

1448
01:15:45,471 --> 01:15:46,472
Tell me something, KK.

1449
01:15:47,073 --> 01:15:48,450
How many films did I do for you?

1450
01:15:49,275 --> 01:15:50,049
Three.

1451
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,144
And what did I do?

1452
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:54,118
In every film either I'm
jumping from the helicopter.

1453
01:15:54,347 --> 01:15:56,953
Or running after the heroine,
or the train.

1454
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:59,962
Or cars..even running
after item girl.

1455
01:16:00,253 --> 01:16:01,789
Did you make me do anything real?

1456
01:16:03,022 --> 01:16:05,263
You know something, if you
don't make me do something new..

1457
01:16:05,358 --> 01:16:06,837
...I will quit this bloody industry.

1458
01:16:06,926 --> 01:16:08,872
Don't say that.

1459
01:16:08,928 --> 01:16:11,204
Saraswati's always
on the set. - Who?

1460
01:16:11,264 --> 01:16:12,504
Lady luck.

1461
01:16:12,665 --> 01:16:15,111
It might just come true.

1462
01:16:15,168 --> 01:16:16,647
Take your words back, Akki please.

1463
01:16:16,736 --> 01:16:17,771
Akshay.. - Ji.

1464
01:16:17,904 --> 01:16:19,212
What? - Ji.

1465
01:16:19,272 --> 01:16:20,478
Ji. - Say again, Ji.

1466
01:16:20,573 --> 01:16:21,643
AkshaYl-i-

1467
01:16:21,741 --> 01:16:23,448
Sir, your shot's ready.

1468
01:16:23,543 --> 01:16:24,544
Ready?

1469
01:16:24,744 --> 01:16:26,189
What a unique film?

1470
01:16:26,546 --> 01:16:28,890
The shot's ready,
and the director's right here.

1471
01:16:30,683 --> 01:16:32,594
Stop all this nonsense.

1472
01:16:33,085 --> 01:16:35,065
Good news, sir.
Another endorsement.

1473
01:16:35,154 --> 01:16:37,065
Helicopter" Sir..
Sir, hold on.

1474
01:16:38,191 --> 01:16:39,192
Akshay.

1475
01:16:40,426 --> 01:16:41,427
Lali. Take.

1476
01:16:41,527 --> 01:16:43,200
Fast. - Who the hell are you?

1477
01:16:44,597 --> 01:16:46,634
Sir, my family. He's my uncle.

1478
01:16:46,766 --> 01:16:48,177
Uncle, okay. You'll get a discount.

1479
01:16:48,267 --> 01:16:50,304
Akshay, I am your biggest fan.

1480
01:16:50,403 --> 01:16:52,246
I've seen all your movies.

1481
01:16:52,438 --> 01:16:54,475
I also have your pictures.
In fact, you were the one..

1482
01:16:54,707 --> 01:16:57,381
...who inspired me
to become a designer.

1483
01:16:57,944 --> 01:17:00,220
Actually,
I made these sunglasses for you.

1484
01:17:00,646 --> 01:17:01,920
If you wear them..

1485
01:17:02,515 --> 01:17:03,550
What am I asking?

1486
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,384
Lali, click.

1487
01:17:07,553 --> 01:17:09,863
Akshay,
you're looking nice in these.

1488
01:17:10,223 --> 01:17:11,600
Doesn't the material
seem different?

1489
01:17:12,091 --> 01:17:14,162
Obviously.
They're made up of my toenails.

1490
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:16,331
I've made them
with my own toenails.

1491
01:17:16,429 --> 01:17:18,272
Uncle, your daughter
wasn't funny at all.

1492
01:17:18,364 --> 01:17:20,037
She's not my daughter.
- Then who is she?

1493
01:17:20,132 --> 01:17:21,634
We're friends. - More than friends.

1494
01:17:22,501 --> 01:17:23,241
Akshay.

1495
01:17:23,336 --> 01:17:24,280
Akshay, I love you.

1496
01:17:24,337 --> 01:17:26,943
You're a Rockstar.

1497
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:28,341
I told you.

1498
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:32,245
No, no, Andi.

1499
01:17:32,345 --> 01:17:35,986
There are already
40 likes on my status.

1500
01:17:36,148 --> 01:17:36,956
Since I posted that picture"

1501
01:17:37,016 --> 01:17:39,360
...Kunal and Tara have gone offline.

1502
01:17:39,685 --> 01:17:41,528
They must be burning with jealousy.

1503
01:17:42,054 --> 01:17:43,897
Oh my, God. So cool.

1504
01:17:44,523 --> 01:17:46,127
Okay, I got to go.

1505
01:17:46,492 --> 01:17:47,436
Chow.

1506
01:17:50,096 --> 01:17:51,131
Lali.

1507
01:17:51,497 --> 01:17:52,498
Happy?

1508
01:17:53,432 --> 01:17:54,103
Happy?

1509
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,680
I am on cloud 9.

1510
01:17:56,769 --> 01:17:59,147
You're the best. - Thank you.

1511
01:18:01,407 --> 01:18:03,284
Remember you said
something the other day.

1512
01:18:03,876 --> 01:18:04,877
What did I say?

1513
01:18:05,511 --> 01:18:06,649
You forgot.

1514
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:10,586
You said whoever introduces
you to Akshay Kumar..

1515
01:18:11,384 --> 01:18:12,556
I feel shy?

1516
01:18:13,352 --> 01:18:15,195
I don't remember. Say it.

1517
01:18:16,789 --> 01:18:18,860
Where's my return gift, Ahana?

1518
01:18:22,528 --> 01:18:23,529
Come here.

1519
01:18:23,863 --> 01:18:24,864
<i>Okay'</i>

1520
01:18:29,535 --> 01:18:30,536
And..

1521
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:32,271
...your gift.

1522
01:18:33,172 --> 01:18:34,242
New title.

1523
01:18:34,941 --> 01:18:35,942
Rockstar.

1524
01:18:36,142 --> 01:18:38,213
Lali the Rockstar.

1525
01:18:39,312 --> 01:18:41,121
Lali the Rockstar.

1526
01:18:41,414 --> 01:18:42,415
Cheers

1527
01:18:44,216 --> 01:18:45,126
Pinky.

1528
01:18:45,184 --> 01:18:46,254
Make another peg for me.

1529
01:18:46,986 --> 01:18:49,762
It's alcohol, not sherbet.

1530
01:18:50,056 --> 01:18:51,262
Gulping aWaY-

1531
01:18:51,691 --> 01:18:53,170
Stop lecturing.

1532
01:18:53,225 --> 01:18:55,535
Make me a peg.

1533
01:18:56,262 --> 01:18:57,639
No.

1534
01:18:58,831 --> 01:19:00,003
Hey guys.

1535
01:19:00,066 --> 01:19:02,808
Friends, Romans and countrymen.

1536
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:07,440
Careful.

1537
01:19:13,112 --> 01:19:14,113
Where were you?

1538
01:19:14,246 --> 01:19:16,920
What did you do with this child?

1539
01:19:17,016 --> 01:19:18,495
Are you crazy?

1540
01:19:18,918 --> 01:19:22,525
I took Ahana to see
Akshay Kumar's shooting.

1541
01:19:23,289 --> 01:19:24,495
Shooting?

1542
01:19:24,623 --> 01:19:26,466
Lali, don't be modest.

1543
01:19:26,859 --> 01:19:31,103
Guys, Lali introduced
me to Akshay Kumar.

1544
01:19:33,232 --> 01:19:34,836
Lali, no..

1545
01:19:37,203 --> 01:19:39,740
He's no longer Lali.

1546
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:42,686
He's a Rockstar. - I am a Rockstar.

1547
01:19:42,742 --> 01:19:44,517
Rockstar Lali.

1548
01:19:44,577 --> 01:19:45,817
<i>Rockstar Lam!</i>

1549
01:19:48,781 --> 01:19:53,958
That ugly looking face,
and Rockstar.

1550
01:19:55,888 --> 01:19:59,836
I'm all over FB because of Lali.

1551
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:04,098
But the shooting must
have ended in 3-4 hours.

1552
01:20:05,164 --> 01:20:06,768
Where did you go after that?

1553
01:20:07,033 --> 01:20:09,013
Actually" - Hold on.

1554
01:20:09,101 --> 01:20:10,546
Ahana, you must be tired.

1555
01:20:10,603 --> 01:20:12,105
I think you should go and sleep.

1556
01:20:12,171 --> 01:20:15,584
No, I am having fun.
- No. Be a good girl.

1557
01:20:15,775 --> 01:20:18,085
Lali the Rockstar's saying this.

1558
01:20:18,277 --> 01:20:21,053
What did she do to get tired?

1559
01:20:21,614 --> 01:20:22,718
I'll tell you, hold on.

1560
01:20:22,882 --> 01:20:23,883
Come on.

1561
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:26,123
Careful.

1562
01:20:26,986 --> 01:20:28,761
You're right, I will go to sleep.

1563
01:20:29,321 --> 01:20:31,164
My back is paining.

1564
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:33,796
Goodnight, boys.
- Goodnight.

1565
01:20:34,026 --> 01:20:36,199
And you, Rockstar.

1566
01:20:39,298 --> 01:20:40,299
Naughty girl.

1567
01:20:40,366 --> 01:20:43,643
So what's happening
with this lady finger?

1568
01:20:43,936 --> 01:20:45,108
Lady finger?

1569
01:20:45,805 --> 01:20:48,945
You were really shrewd.

1570
01:20:49,175 --> 01:20:52,019
You made schemes in the night.

1571
01:20:52,511 --> 01:20:53,683
Amazing.

1572
01:20:53,746 --> 01:20:54,952
Don't be jealous.

1573
01:20:55,514 --> 01:20:57,585
All three had equal opportunity.

1574
01:20:57,983 --> 01:21:00,827
I was smart and won the game.

1575
01:21:01,153 --> 01:21:03,258
You're not smart, but a traitor.

1576
01:21:03,889 --> 01:21:06,961
Tell me what you
did after the shooting?

1577
01:21:07,159 --> 01:21:08,695
You see..it was my promise..

1578
01:21:08,761 --> 01:21:10,604
...to introduce her to Akshay Kumar.

1579
01:21:10,863 --> 01:21:12,137
I fulfilled that.

1580
01:21:12,465 --> 01:21:14,411
And then her promise..

1581
01:21:14,533 --> 01:21:15,534
What?

1582
01:21:15,768 --> 01:21:17,543
I must admit.

1583
01:21:18,137 --> 01:21:19,707
She's true to her words.

1584
01:21:20,439 --> 01:21:21,850
Okay, goodnight.

1585
01:21:23,576 --> 01:21:25,817
My back's paining too.

1586
01:21:26,645 --> 01:21:29,023
Lal I Rockstar, good n ig ht.

1587
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:32,324
Oh my, God!

1588
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:40,027
Make me a drink.

1589
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,361
You do it.

1590
01:21:42,461 --> 01:21:45,135
Don't waste time,
lam on a ISD call.

1591
01:21:45,264 --> 01:21:46,902
For the last time I am asking you.

1592
01:21:47,032 --> 01:21:48,978
What's the name of
Akshay Kumar's uncle..

1593
01:21:49,135 --> 01:21:51,809
...who lives at Chandni Chowk?

1594
01:21:51,871 --> 01:21:54,750
He's a distant uncle.

1595
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,820
You always said he's special.

1596
01:21:57,076 --> 01:22:00,148
He's your friend too.
- That's true.

1597
01:22:00,312 --> 01:22:01,450
But he's a distant uncle.

1598
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:02,524
Fine, tell me his name?

1599
01:22:02,581 --> 01:22:03,992
Manu.
Manu Kukreja..

1600
01:22:04,216 --> 01:22:06,196
He owns a sari shop
at Chawdi Bazaar.

1601
01:22:06,919 --> 01:22:08,023
He's really respected.

1602
01:22:08,087 --> 01:22:11,694
Fine, call him now and
tell him to talk to Akshay Kumar.

1603
01:22:11,757 --> 01:22:14,966
And tell him to invite me for tea.

1604
01:22:15,127 --> 01:22:19,576
I need to urgently introduce
someone to Akshay Kumar.

1605
01:22:19,632 --> 01:22:21,236
But he's not in Delhi.

1606
01:22:21,767 --> 01:22:24,008
He's gone to Vaishno Devi.

1607
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:25,271
Hail Goddess!

1608
01:22:29,441 --> 01:22:32,285
Ahana. Where's my omelet, darling?

1609
01:22:32,444 --> 01:22:33,752
I am hungry?

1610
01:22:34,046 --> 01:22:35,354
Just two minutes, Rockstar.

1611
01:22:35,514 --> 01:22:36,686
Okay Rockstar.

1612
01:22:36,849 --> 01:22:38,328
Would you like a piece of bread?

1613
01:22:38,517 --> 01:22:40,292
How about a slap?

1614
01:22:40,653 --> 01:22:41,654
Jealous.

1615
01:22:42,188 --> 01:22:45,192
Ahana. - Here we go.

1616
01:22:45,424 --> 01:22:48,496
A very special omelet,
for my Rockstar.

1617
01:22:48,594 --> 01:22:49,470
Rockstar.

1618
01:22:49,562 --> 01:22:51,735
Ocean Snail's omelet. Eat it.

1619
01:22:54,266 --> 01:22:56,268
Snail? You mean turtle?

1620
01:22:57,536 --> 01:22:59,709
No. I am not hungry,
I won't eat it.

1621
01:22:59,972 --> 01:23:02,316
Why not? Eat it.

1622
01:23:02,374 --> 01:23:04,149
Ahana, feed him yourself.

1623
01:23:04,443 --> 01:23:06,821
I don't want it.
lam not hungry.

1624
01:23:07,179 --> 01:23:09,887
I am allergic to omelet.

1625
01:23:12,751 --> 01:23:15,459
I'll come.

1626
01:23:15,554 --> 01:23:17,625
I'll come, son. Definitely.

1627
01:23:17,756 --> 01:23:19,599
Bless you, son.

1628
01:23:19,658 --> 01:23:20,898
And listen.

1629
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:24,471
If you ever need
money in Mauritius.

1630
01:23:24,563 --> 01:23:25,871
...then call uncle KD.

1631
01:23:26,131 --> 01:23:28,008
Okay, son?
Okay. Hail Goddess.

1632
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,238
Hail Goddess.

1633
01:23:29,435 --> 01:23:31,972
Hello. Breakfast?

1634
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:35,378
I can guess from your faces..

1635
01:23:35,608 --> 01:23:37,212
"That Ahana made breakfast.

1636
01:23:37,276 --> 01:23:38,812
That's right. You try it too.

1637
01:23:38,944 --> 01:23:40,753
Thank you, but I am full.

1638
01:23:40,779 --> 01:23:43,385
Finished jogging? - Yes, I did.

1639
01:23:43,616 --> 01:23:45,095
And I even talked to Rajiv.

1640
01:23:45,351 --> 01:23:47,558
I wonder how he found my number..

1641
01:23:47,686 --> 01:23:49,427
...and also that I am in Mauritius.

1642
01:23:49,588 --> 01:23:50,498
Who Rajiv?

1643
01:23:50,556 --> 01:23:51,864
Rajiv Bhatia.

1644
01:23:53,325 --> 01:23:56,101
You guys call him..Akshay Kumar.

1645
01:23:56,328 --> 01:23:57,898
What? Akshay?

1646
01:23:58,297 --> 01:24:00,004
What's going on?

1647
01:24:00,132 --> 01:24:01,736
What Akshay?

1648
01:24:01,834 --> 01:24:03,211
He's Raju for me.

1649
01:24:03,469 --> 01:24:05,745
He was saying..uncle KD,
I hate you.

1650
01:24:05,938 --> 01:24:08,316
You're in Mauritius
and you didn't tell me.

1651
01:24:08,507 --> 01:24:10,214
You have to come for tea.

1652
01:24:10,409 --> 01:24:13,652
He was insisting.
My sweet boy.

1653
01:24:13,746 --> 01:24:18,889
So you will have
tea with Akshay Kumar?

1654
01:24:19,051 --> 01:24:21,759
He's inviting me
to his personal chamber.

1655
01:24:21,854 --> 01:24:23,856
Not outside like other fans.

1656
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:29,163
KD..you're a Rockstar.

1657
01:24:29,962 --> 01:24:32,602
Rockstar,
please can I come along with you?

1658
01:24:32,831 --> 01:24:34,139
What's going on?

1659
01:24:34,266 --> 01:24:36,769
I am not a Rockstar, he is.

1660
01:24:37,269 --> 01:24:39,374
Forget about him. - Ahana.

1661
01:24:39,638 --> 01:24:40,742
It was a joke.

1662
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:44,147
Please, can I come along? - Okay.

1663
01:24:44,843 --> 01:24:46,948
But what will I get in return?

1664
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:49,587
More than what Lali got.

1665
01:24:51,283 --> 01:24:53,092
What's going on?

1666
01:25:02,061 --> 01:25:03,199
You're a bassvku:

1667
01:25:04,863 --> 01:25:05,807
Ranjit sir.

1668
01:25:05,864 --> 01:25:07,866
You women-beater.
- Mind your language.

1669
01:25:07,933 --> 01:25:09,674
This is Akshay Kumar.

1670
01:25:10,035 --> 01:25:11,639
Akshay. Akshay who?

1671
01:25:11,937 --> 01:25:13,143
I am talking to Shubhojit.

1672
01:25:13,639 --> 01:25:17,018
Listen, you're not
Akshay Kumar for me.

1673
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:19,153
You're my Shubhojit.

1674
01:25:19,912 --> 01:25:21,050
My character.

1675
01:25:23,282 --> 01:25:24,590
My character.

1676
01:25:29,688 --> 01:25:31,998
So Shubojit doesn't play golf.

1677
01:25:33,125 --> 01:25:37,096
When will you understand
my Shubhojit? When?

1678
01:25:37,596 --> 01:25:39,166
Sir, I'm trying my
best to understand him.

1679
01:25:39,231 --> 01:25:40,608
The book that you gave me..

1680
01:25:40,666 --> 01:25:42,703
...on Shubhojifs life history,
I read it all night.

1681
01:25:42,835 --> 01:25:44,007
Sir, it contains information"

1682
01:25:44,136 --> 01:25:48,278
"about Shubhojifs father,
grandfather, uncle, nephew, everyone..

1683
01:25:49,842 --> 01:25:51,879
But nothing on Shubhojit.

1684
01:25:52,077 --> 01:25:55,889
To understand Shubhojit,
you need to know his history.

1685
01:25:56,215 --> 01:25:59,685
Get in this history
and grab Shubhojifs soul.

1686
01:26:00,085 --> 01:26:01,063
Relax.

1687
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:04,863
I promise you, soon I'll
grab everything about him.

1688
01:26:05,124 --> 01:26:05,966
I promise you.

1689
01:26:06,024 --> 01:26:09,699
Look, Shubhojit is
an evil and lowly man.

1690
01:26:09,828 --> 01:26:12,900
He's dark on the inside.

1691
01:26:13,799 --> 01:26:16,803
He's basically..HKB.

1692
01:26:17,436 --> 01:26:18,176
What?

1693
01:26:18,237 --> 01:26:19,716
'Hawas Ka Pujari.'

1694
01:26:20,105 --> 01:26:21,243
Now relax.

1695
01:26:24,743 --> 01:26:25,380
Action.

1696
01:26:25,444 --> 01:26:27,583
Sir, this is the plot
of the famous Hollywood film..

1697
01:26:27,646 --> 01:26:28,920
"Talented Mr. Ripley.

1698
01:26:29,047 --> 01:26:30,219
You think I am copying.

1699
01:26:30,382 --> 01:26:31,326
I am copying?

1700
01:26:31,383 --> 01:26:33,727
That's why managers
always remain managers.

1701
01:26:33,852 --> 01:26:35,422
Sir, don't mind him.

1702
01:26:35,487 --> 01:26:37,057
Go, go. -Yes, sir.

1703
01:26:37,122 --> 01:26:38,863
Leave my Shubhojit alone.

1704
01:26:38,924 --> 01:26:40,096
Sir.. - Please.

1705
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:41,160
Out.

1706
01:26:42,261 --> 01:26:44,867
I really apologize.
Sorry about that.

1707
01:26:45,497 --> 01:26:46,373
No entry, boss.

1708
01:26:46,432 --> 01:26:48,878
Tell Rajiv,
uncle KD's here to meet him.

1709
01:26:49,468 --> 01:26:51,675
Rajiv who? - Don't irritate me.

1710
01:26:51,837 --> 01:26:54,613
Tell Akshay Kumar that
his KD uncle from Delhi..

1711
01:26:54,673 --> 01:26:56,152
...is here to see him.

1712
01:26:57,376 --> 01:26:58,855
Tell Akshay sir
that his uncle's here.

1713
01:26:58,977 --> 01:27:00,888
Totally awesome.

1714
01:27:00,979 --> 01:27:02,185
Hail Goddess.

1715
01:27:02,247 --> 01:27:03,419
Son. - Yes.

1716
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:05,654
Stop reading,
concentrate on your job.

1717
01:27:06,084 --> 01:27:07,290
Where's Akshay Kumar's van?

1718
01:27:07,553 --> 01:27:09,157
Sir, we don't have vans,
only tents.

1719
01:27:09,321 --> 01:27:10,823
Fine, where's Akshay Kumar's tent?

1720
01:27:11,156 --> 01:27:12,134
This side.

1721
01:27:12,224 --> 01:27:14,067
Okay. Come on.

1722
01:27:14,626 --> 01:27:16,902
Son, concentrate on your job.

1723
01:27:16,962 --> 01:27:19,101
Work hard, and you'll be a star soon.
- Yes, sir.

1724
01:27:19,865 --> 01:27:21,003
And who are you?

1725
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,143
Tell him, son.

1726
01:27:23,202 --> 01:27:24,943
Uncle KD, Akshay sir's guest.

1727
01:27:25,604 --> 01:27:26,912
You? - What?

1728
01:27:28,874 --> 01:27:29,875
What?

1729
01:27:30,609 --> 01:27:31,679
Tea or coffee?

1730
01:27:33,178 --> 01:27:33,747
<i>Water.</i>

1731
01:27:33,812 --> 01:27:34,813
First water.

1732
01:27:35,013 --> 01:27:35,991
You tell me, I will send it.

1733
01:27:36,048 --> 01:27:37,322
You're local.

1734
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:39,154
That looks constipated.

1735
01:27:39,485 --> 01:27:40,759
Lose some of it.

1736
01:27:40,853 --> 01:27:42,594
Bring that dirty feeling.

1737
01:27:44,923 --> 01:27:45,924
Dirtier.

1738
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:47,399
Dirtier.

1739
01:27:47,459 --> 01:27:48,961
Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! Dirty!

1740
01:27:49,027 --> 01:27:50,097
Hey"

1741
01:27:50,162 --> 01:27:52,802
Very nice.

1742
01:27:52,865 --> 01:27:54,435
Great.

1743
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:57,240
Don't move.

1744
01:27:58,670 --> 01:28:02,584
Now..look at yourself
in the mirror.

1745
01:28:03,108 --> 01:28:05,816
Sir, I can't breathe.

1746
01:28:06,078 --> 01:28:08,422
This face will become your reality.

1747
01:28:08,647 --> 01:28:10,923
Fits!
Sir's getting the fits.

1748
01:28:11,016 --> 01:28:13,929
Hey.. shut up.

1749
01:28:14,486 --> 01:28:16,090
We're working on my expression"

1750
01:28:16,221 --> 01:28:17,564
...and you think I am getting fits.

1751
01:28:18,190 --> 01:28:19,328
Such a great director.

1752
01:28:21,693 --> 01:28:22,228
Idiot.

1753
01:28:22,294 --> 01:28:22,829
Oh, God.

1754
01:28:22,895 --> 01:28:25,569
So sorry to disturb you.
Your uncle's here to see you.

1755
01:28:26,265 --> 01:28:28,211
My uncle? - Yes, uncle KD.

1756
01:28:28,567 --> 01:28:31,047
What KD? - Yes, uncle KD.

1757
01:28:35,574 --> 01:28:37,645
Akshay Kumar doesn't
have an uncle as well.

1758
01:28:37,743 --> 01:28:39,586
You do, he's waiting.

1759
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:45,628
Shubhojit.

1760
01:28:45,684 --> 01:28:46,992
Script is your God.

1761
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:49,622
If you don't take care of it,
it won't take care of you.

1762
01:28:49,955 --> 01:28:51,025
Respect. - Mistake.

1763
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:53,460
Calm down. - Go.

1764
01:28:59,331 --> 01:29:02,835
Ahana, you enjoying?

1765
01:29:03,402 --> 01:29:04,574
I am going crazy.

1766
01:29:04,636 --> 01:29:06,946
I am in Akshay's
personal makeup room.

1767
01:29:07,005 --> 01:29:08,951
KD..click me!

1768
01:29:11,476 --> 01:29:12,546
Okay, babe.

1769
01:29:24,289 --> 01:29:25,632
Show me.

1770
01:29:26,592 --> 01:29:28,299
Come on. - First hug me.

1771
01:29:30,729 --> 01:29:31,434
Naughty KD.

1772
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:32,531
What's going on?

1773
01:29:32,998 --> 01:29:34,204
Akshay!

1774
01:29:34,967 --> 01:29:35,502
You?

1775
01:29:35,567 --> 01:29:36,739
I got something for you.

1776
01:29:36,835 --> 01:29:38,746
Rajiv, my son.

1777
01:29:38,904 --> 01:29:40,577
You insisted so much.

1778
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:41,947
So I am here for tea.

1779
01:29:42,007 --> 01:29:43,452
Tea? - No, thanks.

1780
01:29:43,508 --> 01:29:45,078
Tea gives me acidity.

1781
01:29:45,577 --> 01:29:48,456
By the way, Manu Kukareja..

1782
01:29:48,513 --> 01:29:50,322
...from Manu Bazaar says hello.

1783
01:29:51,016 --> 01:29:52,256
Who is Manu Kukareja?

1784
01:29:53,085 --> 01:29:55,463
You haven't patched up
with Manu uncle yet, Rajiv?

1785
01:29:55,621 --> 01:29:57,191
What's Rajiv?

1786
01:29:57,255 --> 01:29:59,997
Fine, Raju. How sweet.

1787
01:30:00,058 --> 01:30:01,264
How sweet, wonderful.

1788
01:30:01,326 --> 01:30:03,636
Don't just stand there, hug him.

1789
01:30:04,262 --> 01:30:05,969
KD, click us. -Yeah.

1790
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:07,237
Is he your father?

1791
01:30:07,766 --> 01:30:08,574
No, dude.

1792
01:30:08,667 --> 01:30:11,546
If he's my father and your uncle
then we would be brother-sister.

1793
01:30:11,603 --> 01:30:12,604
That's just gross.

1794
01:30:13,005 --> 01:30:14,109
We're just friends.

1795
01:30:14,172 --> 01:30:15,515
No, more than friends.

1796
01:30:15,574 --> 01:30:16,450
Hold my leg.

1797
01:30:16,541 --> 01:30:17,849
Rajiv, hold it.

1798
01:30:18,677 --> 01:30:19,655
Click us, quickly.

1799
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:22,988
Akshay, I designed this scarf.

1800
01:30:23,081 --> 01:30:26,028
I created it from pigeon feathers.

1801
01:30:26,218 --> 01:30:28,755
Mony..Rakesh..Sharma.

1802
01:30:28,787 --> 01:30:30,289
Son, we can party later.

1803
01:30:30,355 --> 01:30:31,459
No need for a party.

1804
01:30:31,523 --> 01:30:33,230
You don't need to
touch my feet either.

1805
01:30:33,291 --> 01:30:34,827
Please, no need for any formality.

1806
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:35,961
We'll leave.
Come on.

1807
01:30:36,028 --> 01:30:37,803
Come on. Let's go.

1808
01:30:38,096 --> 01:30:40,076
Akshay, I love you.

1809
01:30:40,132 --> 01:30:43,011
Come on.
No problem.

1810
01:30:44,603 --> 01:30:47,311
Rajiv.. - Are you leaving,
or should I throw you out?

1811
01:30:47,472 --> 01:30:49,577
No, we've got our
own transportation.

1812
01:30:49,641 --> 01:30:50,642
Good.

1813
01:30:51,276 --> 01:30:53,119
If you need anything in Delhi..

1814
01:30:53,178 --> 01:30:54,179
Damodar.

1815
01:30:55,213 --> 01:30:56,214
Yes, sir.

1816
01:30:57,149 --> 01:31:03,191
Next time I see this
girl on my set, I'll slap you.

1817
01:31:03,755 --> 01:31:05,701
On second thoughts,
I'll slap you anyway.

1818
01:31:07,192 --> 01:31:09,001
Go, get the coconut water.

1819
01:31:09,127 --> 01:31:09,571
Out.

1820
01:31:09,628 --> 01:31:10,971
Kuku, coconut.

1821
01:31:12,631 --> 01:31:16,204
KD..they are already
200 likes on my status.

1822
01:31:16,268 --> 01:31:17,713
Look at the comments.

1823
01:31:17,769 --> 01:31:20,807
See. Raju respects me so much.

1824
01:31:21,573 --> 01:31:24,315
You see,
our kids are very cultured.

1825
01:31:24,376 --> 01:31:25,480
Traditional.

1826
01:31:26,978 --> 01:31:30,721
KD, you think Akshay
liked the scarf I designed?

1827
01:31:31,583 --> 01:31:35,998
Of course, you're a great designer.

1828
01:31:37,289 --> 01:31:39,792
He must have gone crazy by now.

1829
01:31:46,932 --> 01:31:48,172
I did it, KD.

1830
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,577
I gave Akshay the
best design of my life.

1831
01:31:55,741 --> 01:31:59,518
<i>AhanaAhana is a Rockstar.</i>

1832
01:32:00,145 --> 01:32:01,715
What about me?

1833
01:32:02,714 --> 01:32:03,886
What am I?

1834
01:32:05,417 --> 01:32:06,418
You?

1835
01:32:08,453 --> 01:32:14,028
KD..you are..a Rockstar.
I love you.

1836
01:32:14,359 --> 01:32:15,599
Now give me a hug.

1837
01:32:16,027 --> 01:32:17,028
Oh, God!

1838
01:32:17,996 --> 01:32:19,100
Oh, God!

1839
01:32:19,898 --> 01:32:23,471
Stop it, dear. Don't make my cry.

1840
01:32:23,602 --> 01:32:25,411
KD, I am too drunk.

1841
01:32:25,504 --> 01:32:26,915
Let's go to the beach. Come on.

1842
01:32:27,773 --> 01:32:28,774
Come on.

1843
01:32:29,074 --> 01:32:31,987
I will float away, Ahana.
- Come on.

1844
01:32:32,377 --> 01:32:35,824
"Have you ever seen.."

1845
01:32:36,114 --> 01:32:39,721
"..anyone's heart going away."

1846
01:32:39,851 --> 01:32:40,761
Come on, KD.

1847
01:32:40,786 --> 01:32:46,361
"There goes my heart..who's
upset with me."

1848
01:32:46,858 --> 01:32:49,896
"There goes my heart."

1849
01:33:31,136 --> 01:33:32,342
What are you two doing here?

1850
01:33:33,138 --> 01:33:36,711
Ahana called and asked for a towel.

1851
01:33:36,875 --> 01:33:39,253
What's going on here?

1852
01:33:40,612 --> 01:33:42,751
You can see what's going on?
Take a look.

1853
01:34:00,298 --> 01:34:04,440
That's the meaning of my life.

1854
01:34:04,569 --> 01:34:07,072
KD, how did you do it?

1855
01:34:07,339 --> 01:34:08,977
Rascals, you don't know me.

1856
01:34:09,441 --> 01:34:12,888
The other name for arrangement
is Kamal Dheer Sharma.

1857
01:34:12,944 --> 01:34:14,014
KD.

1858
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:19,851
Hey. guys-

1859
01:34:21,453 --> 01:34:23,160
Thanks, Pinky.
Give me the towel. - No.

1860
01:34:23,221 --> 01:34:24,564
You don't need it.

1861
01:34:24,623 --> 01:34:25,966
There's a cool breeze blowing.

1862
01:34:26,157 --> 01:34:27,932
You'll dry up yourself.

1863
01:34:28,693 --> 01:34:29,763
Sorry, Pinky.

1864
01:34:29,861 --> 01:34:31,340
I am going up, I am tired.

1865
01:34:32,197 --> 01:34:34,268
Bye KD, I love you Rockstar.

1866
01:34:34,599 --> 01:34:36,977
Bring my clothes. - Okay.

1867
01:34:37,035 --> 01:34:38,605
Pinky, get her slippers.

1868
01:34:40,105 --> 01:34:42,176
Don't be shocked,
I'll tell you everything.

1869
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:44,117
You pick up the underwear
and the slippers.

1870
01:34:45,944 --> 01:34:46,888
Yeah, baby.

1871
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:52,751
KD.

1872
01:34:54,286 --> 01:34:55,629
You were right.

1873
01:34:56,554 --> 01:34:57,931
This girl's really fast.

1874
01:34:58,623 --> 01:35:00,796
First me, then you.

1875
01:35:03,662 --> 01:35:08,668
Lali, this is generation X.

1876
01:35:09,167 --> 01:35:10,908
No big deal in sex.

1877
01:35:11,136 --> 01:35:14,310
This is just time pass for them.

1878
01:35:14,806 --> 01:35:16,843
Food's horrible, let's have sex.

1879
01:35:18,677 --> 01:35:21,089
Movie's so boring, let's have sex.

1880
01:35:21,146 --> 01:35:23,456
How cute puppy, want to have sex?

1881
01:35:27,085 --> 01:35:28,621
You two should be ashamed.

1882
01:35:29,254 --> 01:35:33,532
One is married..and the other.

1883
01:35:33,959 --> 01:35:35,267
It's futile to talk to you.

1884
01:35:35,527 --> 01:35:36,665
What's wrong with you now?

1885
01:35:36,728 --> 01:35:37,536
Nothing.

1886
01:35:37,595 --> 01:35:40,166
Mr. Goyal's lost his mind
after watching Ahana in a bikini.

1887
01:35:40,332 --> 01:35:43,973
No..l am gearing up too.

1888
01:35:44,903 --> 01:35:45,904
For what?

1889
01:35:46,071 --> 01:35:49,951
I am a contender
too in Ahana's case.

1890
01:35:50,141 --> 01:35:52,178
Pinky! Pinky! Pinky!

1891
01:35:52,243 --> 01:35:55,554
Don't you ever think about it!

1892
01:35:55,914 --> 01:35:57,325
Pinky.

1893
01:35:57,716 --> 01:36:00,629
Ahana's like the Gucci
and Armani showroom.

1894
01:36:00,986 --> 01:36:03,398
...and you're a bag of spices.

1895
01:36:03,488 --> 01:36:06,526
Lali, you're overdoing it now.

1896
01:36:06,958 --> 01:36:10,269
Pinky. Ahana is my love.

1897
01:36:11,296 --> 01:36:17,941
I can't tolerate an old
man like you looking at her.

1898
01:36:18,403 --> 01:36:22,874
I swear on my dead grandma,
Shakuntala Devi.

1899
01:36:22,941 --> 01:36:27,788
If I don't make Ahana
sit on my lap in 24 hours..

1900
01:36:28,246 --> 01:36:31,159
...then my name isn't
Harishankar Goyal aka Pinky.

1901
01:36:31,216 --> 01:36:32,286
Keep it dog.

1902
01:36:36,821 --> 01:36:37,925
Cheers!

1903
01:36:42,227 --> 01:36:44,605
What happened, uncle?
Why did you call me so urgently?

1904
01:36:44,863 --> 01:36:47,207
You know Akshay
Kumar's in Mauritius.

1905
01:36:47,499 --> 01:36:50,002
So do anything you can,
and introduce me to him.

1906
01:36:50,769 --> 01:36:52,271
Uncle, you're really fortunate.

1907
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:54,177
Remember I told
you that our company..

1908
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:56,276
...is sponsoring a program
for the Indian Community.

1909
01:36:56,341 --> 01:36:57,046
Yes. Yes.

1910
01:36:57,108 --> 01:36:58,951
The chief guest for
that is Akshay Kumar.

1911
01:36:59,110 --> 01:37:01,181
Just tell me how many passes
you want. I'll arrange for it.

1912
01:37:01,613 --> 01:37:03,786
No. No passes.

1913
01:37:03,882 --> 01:37:04,724
No passes.

1914
01:37:04,783 --> 01:37:07,593
I'll be the other chief
guest of that event.

1915
01:37:07,819 --> 01:37:10,231
I'll sit next to Akshay Kumar.

1916
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:14,626
Shut up.

1917
01:37:15,827 --> 01:37:17,568
That's so absurd.

1918
01:37:17,862 --> 01:37:18,863
It's impossible.

1919
01:37:18,930 --> 01:37:20,432
Impossible? I see.

1920
01:37:20,665 --> 01:37:24,112
Then I'm giving the dealership
to Chhada and Chhada.

1921
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:25,806
Uncle, that's blackmail.

1922
01:37:25,870 --> 01:37:28,180
Yes, hello Chhada sir..
- Okay, done.

1923
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:28,979
Done.

1924
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,145
Fine, you're our chief guest no.2.

1925
01:37:31,209 --> 01:37:33,746
I'll sit next to Akshay Kumar.

1926
01:37:34,579 --> 01:37:39,255
And..also arrange for one
VIP and two general passes.

1927
01:37:43,188 --> 01:37:44,189
Ahana.

1928
01:37:50,395 --> 01:37:53,638
You haven't caught on
to Shubhojifs character.

1929
01:37:53,832 --> 01:37:55,470
Sir, I am trying.

1930
01:37:55,533 --> 01:37:57,308
I am trying my level best.

1931
01:37:57,435 --> 01:37:58,436
I am trying-

1932
01:37:58,570 --> 01:37:59,571
<i>Okay'</i>

1933
01:38:00,572 --> 01:38:01,642
Do you know method acting?

1934
01:38:02,507 --> 01:38:03,542
That's fine.

1935
01:38:03,641 --> 01:38:05,348
I'll give you some motivation.

1936
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:10,381
Here.

1937
01:38:12,517 --> 01:38:14,622
Imagine that he's a lowly man.

1938
01:38:15,653 --> 01:38:16,859
Your enemy.

1939
01:38:18,123 --> 01:38:19,898
He murdered your mother.

1940
01:38:20,892 --> 01:38:22,428
He killed your mother.

1941
01:38:23,461 --> 01:38:25,236
Now you've to yell at him.

1942
01:38:26,064 --> 01:38:27,873
Do it.

1943
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:34,416
Rascal. My mother's.
- Anger.

1944
01:38:35,907 --> 01:38:39,116
Sir, look at his face.
It's so cute.

1945
01:38:39,444 --> 01:38:41,355
How can I get angry on him?

1946
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:43,681
Give him back.

1947
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:47,261
You can't do anything.

1948
01:38:47,385 --> 01:38:49,922
You can only do Khiladi films.
Khiladi.

1949
01:38:50,155 --> 01:38:51,395
You can't even get angry.

1950
01:39:00,231 --> 01:39:03,178
What..what are you doing?
- Nothing.

1951
01:39:03,301 --> 01:39:04,780
My back's itching.

1952
01:39:05,036 --> 01:39:06,242
Just scratching my back.

1953
01:39:16,347 --> 01:39:18,850
Seems like Pinky has
planned something big.

1954
01:39:19,083 --> 01:39:20,585
Right?
- That's fine..

1955
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:24,362
...but I hope he
doesn't mess up in over-excitement.

1956
01:39:24,856 --> 01:39:26,836
Oh my, God.
Guys, look at Kunal's status.

1957
01:39:26,891 --> 01:39:28,564
He's coming for the same event.

1958
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:30,296
This will be so much fun.

1959
01:39:30,895 --> 01:39:31,703
But where's Pinky?

1960
01:39:31,763 --> 01:39:32,798
Here I am, Ahana.

1961
01:39:33,865 --> 01:39:34,935
Oh my, God.

1962
01:39:40,872 --> 01:39:44,319
Pinky, you look awesome.
What's going on?

1963
01:39:44,943 --> 01:39:46,752
I did this for you.

1964
01:39:46,911 --> 01:39:48,618
To introduce you to Akshay Kumar.

1965
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:50,682
Really? How?

1966
01:39:50,748 --> 01:39:52,625
He's the other chief
guest of our event.

1967
01:39:53,251 --> 01:39:55,128
Not just me,
you're the chief guest too.

1968
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:57,257
Akshay Kumar, will garland us both.

1969
01:39:57,655 --> 01:39:58,759
What are you saying?

1970
01:39:58,823 --> 01:40:01,201
Oh my, God. Thanks.

1971
01:40:01,259 --> 01:40:02,465
Thanks? No thanks.

1972
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:05,370
I want full service,
better than KD and Lali.

1973
01:40:05,563 --> 01:40:06,906
What do you mean?

1974
01:40:07,298 --> 01:40:08,140
Full service..

1975
01:40:08,233 --> 01:40:11,237
Akshay Kumar sounds
like he's quite irritated.

1976
01:40:11,436 --> 01:40:13,848
Nothing should go wrong..
Whatever happens.

1977
01:40:14,072 --> 01:40:15,642
Hey..who is he?

1978
01:40:15,873 --> 01:40:17,750
Magician.
Fantastic.

1979
01:40:17,809 --> 01:40:19,550
Akshay Kumar loves magic.

1980
01:40:19,611 --> 01:40:21,318
Don't forget the rabbit trick.

1981
01:40:21,379 --> 01:40:22,187
Don't forget.

1982
01:40:22,247 --> 01:40:24,454
He's here.
Out of the way.

1983
01:40:24,515 --> 01:40:25,516
Security.

1984
01:40:30,655 --> 01:40:32,532
I asked you not
to take a photograph.

1985
01:40:33,291 --> 01:40:34,531
Why is she taking my photograph?

1986
01:40:34,959 --> 01:40:36,461
I can do this character.

1987
01:40:36,527 --> 01:40:37,699
God, he's drunk.

1988
01:40:37,762 --> 01:40:41,209
Hi, Rajiv.
- I'll never get a National Award.

1989
01:40:41,299 --> 01:40:42,539
Listen, forget about that. Focus?

1990
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:44,705
Focus where?

1991
01:40:45,136 --> 01:40:46,706
Ranjit Basu gave me a dog..

1992
01:40:46,771 --> 01:40:48,648
...and said he's my mother's killer.

1993
01:40:48,706 --> 01:40:50,413
Oh, God.
- You should've seen that dog.

1994
01:40:50,508 --> 01:40:51,418
He's so damn cute..

1995
01:40:51,476 --> 01:40:52,284
Your eyes..

1996
01:40:52,343 --> 01:40:54,414
Wear your glasses, please.
I'm going to have a heart attack.

1997
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:55,981
Listen.
Let's focus here.

1998
01:40:56,147 --> 01:40:57,751
Forget about Ranjit Basu.
Forget about him.

1999
01:40:57,815 --> 01:40:59,226
Focus about 200 crores club.

2000
01:40:59,284 --> 01:41:00,354
Okay.
Let's go.

2001
01:41:00,585 --> 01:41:02,155
Stage is that side.

2002
01:41:02,353 --> 01:41:03,661
Why do they keep moving the stage?

2003
01:41:03,721 --> 01:41:04,893
Ladies and Gentlemen"

2004
01:41:05,123 --> 01:41:07,694
...with a big round of
applause please welcome..

2005
01:41:08,293 --> 01:41:10,273
The lady's heart throb,
the superstar"

2006
01:41:10,395 --> 01:41:11,703
Mr. Akshay Kumar.

2007
01:41:31,416 --> 01:41:32,417
Sir.

2008
01:41:36,254 --> 01:41:38,530
And our guest of
honor for tonight"

2009
01:41:39,123 --> 01:41:41,364
...the King of raw spices.

2010
01:41:41,759 --> 01:41:43,397
Mr. Harishankar Goyal.

2011
01:41:44,696 --> 01:41:45,697
Clap!

2012
01:41:56,607 --> 01:41:57,608
Garland!

2013
01:41:58,242 --> 01:41:59,243
Garland!

2014
01:42:00,311 --> 01:42:03,224
I would like to request Mr.
Akshay..

2015
01:42:03,648 --> 01:42:08,563
...to honor our
guest and his friend.

2016
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:11,466
Applause,

2017
01:42:11,756 --> 01:42:13,167
What nonsense is this?

2018
01:42:13,257 --> 01:42:14,497
This was not in the deal.

2019
01:42:14,659 --> 01:42:15,797
There's nothing I can do.

2020
01:42:15,893 --> 01:42:18,601
Either Akshay sir honors my guest
or my deal gets cancelled.

2021
01:42:18,663 --> 01:42:20,404
Please understand"
- You're trying to blackmail me..

2022
01:42:20,465 --> 01:42:22,775
...in front of the media.
- Sir, please. Try to understand.

2023
01:42:22,834 --> 01:42:24,211
Someone's blackmailing
me too. Please.

2024
01:42:24,268 --> 01:42:25,178
I can't allow this.

2025
01:42:25,236 --> 01:42:26,271
Sir. Sir. Sir.

2026
01:42:26,337 --> 01:42:28,681
Look, sir.. we will have to do
something, many people have come here.

2027
01:42:28,806 --> 01:42:29,807
Akshay.

2028
01:42:30,508 --> 01:42:32,385
I will break your legs.

2029
01:42:32,443 --> 01:42:33,979
Sir, the media's here.

2030
01:42:34,245 --> 01:42:35,280
You'll have to do it.

2031
01:42:37,915 --> 01:42:38,916
Akshay.

2032
01:42:39,283 --> 01:42:40,284
Good to see you again.

2033
01:42:40,351 --> 01:42:41,728
I've another gift for you.

2034
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:43,899
My biggest creation.

2035
01:42:44,555 --> 01:42:46,831
Isn't she the same girl that
comes on the sets? - Yes, sir.

2036
01:42:47,458 --> 01:42:51,702
If she tries to touch me, I'll
slap her in front of the media.

2037
01:42:51,963 --> 01:42:54,500
She's a bloody stalker"
- Not necessary.

2038
01:42:56,267 --> 01:42:57,769
Akshay garlands me.

2039
01:42:58,936 --> 01:43:01,712
He garlands him.
- I will shoot you.

2040
01:43:01,973 --> 01:43:02,974
Garland.

2041
01:43:03,474 --> 01:43:05,511
You can shoot me, sir.
But garland him.

2042
01:43:05,676 --> 01:43:07,053
Pinky.

2043
01:43:07,745 --> 01:43:09,918
Look at Kunal's condition.
He's so jealous.

2044
01:43:10,081 --> 01:43:10,889
I am thrilled.

2045
01:43:10,948 --> 01:43:12,621
Girl, focus on me.

2046
01:43:13,017 --> 01:43:14,018
Garland..Garland..

2047
01:43:16,554 --> 01:43:19,728
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I would like to request.

2048
01:43:19,791 --> 01:43:23,398
...Mr. Akshay Kumar to
honor our guest and his friend.

2049
01:43:23,795 --> 01:43:25,468
Sir, please do it.

2050
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:27,676
Sir, just for a few minutes.

2051
01:43:27,932 --> 01:43:29,434
Hey, give me the garland.

2052
01:43:29,867 --> 01:43:32,609
Sir, we will have to do. We
don't have a choice.

2053
01:43:32,670 --> 01:43:33,978
Sir, please come.

2054
01:43:36,441 --> 01:43:37,715
Sir, come.

2055
01:43:38,109 --> 01:43:39,213
Garland whom?

2056
01:43:39,444 --> 01:43:40,787
Sir, the one who is sitting.

2057
01:43:44,148 --> 01:43:46,958
'Akshay,
I've designed this scarf..'

2058
01:43:47,485 --> 01:43:50,329
'..from pigeon feathers.'

2059
01:43:50,655 --> 01:43:52,328
'You don't know how to get angry.'

2060
01:43:52,390 --> 01:43:54,495
'You can only do Khiladi films.'

2061
01:43:54,559 --> 01:43:56,232
'Listen to me, sir.'
'Let's focus here.'

2062
01:43:56,294 --> 01:43:57,864
Forget about Ranjit Basu.

2063
01:43:57,929 --> 01:43:59,408
'Focus on 200 crores club.'

2064
01:43:59,464 --> 01:44:00,499
<i>'Okay? Let's go.'</i>

2065
01:44:01,532 --> 01:44:04,308
Sir, please. You have to do it.

2066
01:44:07,071 --> 01:44:09,347
Put the garland,
the girl has come to meet you.

2067
01:44:09,674 --> 01:44:12,587
You do your job,
so I can do mine with her.

2068
01:44:12,944 --> 01:44:14,446
Pinky, what are you talking about?

2069
01:44:14,512 --> 01:44:16,549
What job? - What's wrong?

2070
01:44:17,114 --> 01:44:19,617
You said you'll sleep with anyone..

2071
01:44:19,684 --> 01:44:21,288
...who introduces
you to Akshay Kumar.

2072
01:44:21,552 --> 01:44:22,895
KD and Lali's turn is up.

2073
01:44:23,154 --> 01:44:24,258
Now it's my turn.

2074
01:44:25,423 --> 01:44:25,833
Pinky.

2075
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:27,494
Pervert old man.

2076
01:44:27,558 --> 01:44:29,401
Sir, control. - What control?

2077
01:44:30,094 --> 01:44:32,973
I know old perverts
like you really well.

2078
01:44:33,331 --> 01:44:35,311
HKP! - HKP?

2079
01:44:35,399 --> 01:44:36,969
'Hawas Ke Pujari.'
- Akshay.

2080
01:44:37,034 --> 01:44:38,035
Shut up!

2081
01:44:38,836 --> 01:44:41,248
I know women like you too.

2082
01:44:42,373 --> 01:44:44,876
She goes around with
a different old man each day.

2083
01:44:44,942 --> 01:44:46,285
I am not that kind of girl.

2084
01:44:46,344 --> 01:44:47,789
Akshay, I am a designer.

2085
01:44:47,845 --> 01:44:50,382
What designer? You don't
know anything about designing.

2086
01:44:50,448 --> 01:44:51,791
Let me tell you about her.

2087
01:44:51,983 --> 01:44:52,984
She's mad.

2088
01:44:53,718 --> 01:44:55,629
This woman is mad.

2089
01:44:55,853 --> 01:44:57,560
Where are you running away?

2090
01:44:57,755 --> 01:44:59,962
Hey"

2091
01:45:00,191 --> 01:45:01,226
Hold on.

2092
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:03,937
Old man no. 1.

2093
01:45:04,228 --> 01:45:05,468
Old man no. 2.

2094
01:45:05,796 --> 01:45:06,934
Old man no. 3.

2095
01:45:07,765 --> 01:45:09,574
What are your names? - KD.

2096
01:45:09,734 --> 01:45:10,303
Lali.

2097
01:45:10,401 --> 01:45:12,881
He owns a shoe-store.
Shoe-store?

2098
01:45:13,037 --> 01:45:16,644
Take shoes from that
store and clobber them.

2099
01:45:16,941 --> 01:45:17,942
Perverts.

2100
01:45:18,476 --> 01:45:22,947
You can land in
your graves anytime.

2101
01:45:23,581 --> 01:45:26,323
But still run behind women.

2102
01:45:26,551 --> 01:45:28,963
They are romantic for girls.

2103
01:45:30,521 --> 01:45:32,296
That girl standing next to you..

2104
01:45:32,356 --> 01:45:34,063
...is your daughter's age,
right? - Yes.

2105
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:35,433
Still you lust her.

2106
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:37,037
Think about sex.

2107
01:45:37,228 --> 01:45:38,969
And make faces.

2108
01:45:39,363 --> 01:45:40,671
You should be ashamed.

2109
01:45:41,599 --> 01:45:43,840
I feel their faces
should be blackened..

2110
01:45:43,968 --> 01:45:46,175
...make them sit on a donkey, and..

2111
01:45:46,304 --> 01:45:48,147
What city are you from?
- Delhi.

2112
01:45:48,205 --> 01:45:49,548
What Delhi? Forget Delhi?

2113
01:45:49,607 --> 01:45:51,348
You all should be
thrown out of India.

2114
01:45:51,409 --> 01:45:54,856
But sir, even you're
making a humiliating scene.

2115
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,081
Scene.

2116
01:45:57,949 --> 01:45:59,451
They are being perverts"

2117
01:45:59,517 --> 01:46:00,894
...and I am making a scene?

2118
01:46:01,118 --> 01:46:02,927
Akshay, are you drunk?

2119
01:46:03,287 --> 01:46:05,289
Come up, lady. Come up.

2120
01:46:05,556 --> 01:46:06,660
Ask me again.

2121
01:46:07,058 --> 01:46:08,833
Akshay, are you drunk?

2122
01:46:08,926 --> 01:46:10,496
Yes, I am drunk.

2123
01:46:11,829 --> 01:46:17,404
I am drunk, but it's
from my own hard earned money.

2124
01:46:17,635 --> 01:46:19,444
I don't owe anyone anything.

2125
01:46:19,570 --> 01:46:20,674
Get that.

2126
01:46:21,405 --> 01:46:22,782
I don't care about anyone.

2127
01:46:23,107 --> 01:46:25,553
Enough of this life of
suffering and drinking in secret.

2128
01:46:27,578 --> 01:46:30,991
I am an alcoholic.

2129
01:46:31,983 --> 01:46:33,985
You want a pose.

2130
01:46:34,285 --> 01:46:35,286
Take a pose!

2131
01:46:39,624 --> 01:46:40,864
Great.

2132
01:46:40,992 --> 01:46:42,938
Shubhojifs angry!

2133
01:46:42,994 --> 01:46:43,995
Great.

2134
01:46:45,930 --> 01:46:46,874
Very nice.

2135
01:46:50,868 --> 01:46:53,849
No sir.. No sir..

2136
01:46:54,605 --> 01:46:55,948
I found you.

2137
01:46:57,341 --> 01:47:00,618
Filmstar Akshay Kumar
abuses in public.

2138
01:47:00,745 --> 01:47:03,191
Akshay Kumar abused three old men..

2139
01:47:03,347 --> 01:47:07,591
...at a Indian community
event in Mauritius.

2140
01:47:08,285 --> 01:47:11,266
And also accused
a female of sex-trade.

2141
01:47:11,689 --> 01:47:13,327
He's not like that.

2142
01:47:13,791 --> 01:47:15,668
I know, I am his wife.

2143
01:47:15,726 --> 01:47:18,468
Our father's mental
condition isn't stable.

2144
01:47:18,629 --> 01:47:21,576
This is his friend KD's fault.

2145
01:47:21,732 --> 01:47:23,234
KD uncle and Lali uncle.

2146
01:47:23,668 --> 01:47:25,909
These two have an eye for our shop.

2147
01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:29,911
I am saying this,
Lali is not romantic.

2148
01:47:30,541 --> 01:47:32,282
Akshay Kumar, in a drunken state.

2149
01:47:33,344 --> 01:47:34,414
What have I done?

2150
01:47:36,414 --> 01:47:37,620
All men are pigs. -Ahana.

2151
01:47:37,682 --> 01:47:40,253
Let me..
- You all think from your pants.

2152
01:47:40,484 --> 01:47:42,054
KD. -You disgust me.

2153
01:47:42,153 --> 01:47:43,154
Leave her.

2154
01:47:44,221 --> 01:47:45,461
Her anger is justified.

2155
01:47:47,925 --> 01:47:48,926
Let's go.

2156
01:47:51,662 --> 01:47:53,437
Delhi's on fire.

2157
01:47:53,864 --> 01:47:55,901
Our news is everywhere.

2158
01:47:56,233 --> 01:47:57,678
Three lecherous men.

2159
01:47:57,802 --> 01:47:59,304
How will we go home?

2160
01:47:59,470 --> 01:48:01,507
Everything will be fine.
We've to be positive.

2161
01:48:01,572 --> 01:48:02,949
This is your fault.

2162
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:04,580
That's Akshay Kumar.

2163
01:48:04,642 --> 01:48:08,556
Run. - Run, run.

2164
01:48:10,114 --> 01:48:11,115
Open the door.

2165
01:48:11,415 --> 01:48:12,587
Open the door.

2166
01:48:14,985 --> 01:48:16,487
Have you three lost your mind?

2167
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:17,860
Why are you all running?

2168
01:48:17,988 --> 01:48:19,433
You will kill us.

2169
01:48:19,924 --> 01:48:21,733
I came here to apologize.

2170
01:48:21,859 --> 01:48:23,429
<i>Say 50"'!-</i>

2171
01:48:24,295 --> 01:48:25,774
I said too much yesterday.

2172
01:48:26,764 --> 01:48:28,903
And where's Ahana?
I want to apologize to her too.

2173
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:31,243
Ahana isn't talking to us.

2174
01:48:32,169 --> 01:48:35,343
Mr. Akshay Kumar,
we made a big mistake.

2175
01:48:35,806 --> 01:48:37,911
That girl was humiliated
because of us.

2176
01:48:38,375 --> 01:48:39,820
Honestly, she doesn't even know..

2177
01:48:39,877 --> 01:48:42,153
...about the cheap
things we said about her.

2178
01:48:43,114 --> 01:48:43,956
You know.

2179
01:48:44,048 --> 01:48:45,925
I can clearly guess
from your faces..

2180
01:48:45,983 --> 01:48:48,122
"That you were all born perverts.

2181
01:48:48,285 --> 01:48:50,959
Excuse me, sir. I am not a pervert.

2182
01:48:51,622 --> 01:48:53,431
This KD got me in this mess.

2183
01:48:53,758 --> 01:48:56,034
I am a respectable man.
Everyone knows me.

2184
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:57,933
I am the secretary of my society.

2185
01:48:58,062 --> 01:49:00,167
Lali, you mean I am a cheap thug.

2186
01:49:00,231 --> 01:49:01,232
Absolutely.

2187
01:49:02,299 --> 01:49:04,404
You dragged me and
Pinky in your cheap plan..

2188
01:49:04,502 --> 01:49:06,413
...for your own pleasure.

2189
01:49:06,837 --> 01:49:08,783
You used our shoulder
to fire your gun.

2190
01:49:09,039 --> 01:49:11,315
And that's why we're in Mauritius.

2191
01:49:11,942 --> 01:49:13,046
We're family men.

2192
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:14,817
We've kids and grandkids.

2193
01:49:15,412 --> 01:49:16,823
Can't you control yourself?

2194
01:49:16,947 --> 01:49:19,587
But no, you don't know
anything about family values.

2195
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:21,152
Lali, you're saying too much.

2196
01:49:21,218 --> 01:49:22,822
What Lali?
- You're saying too much.

2197
01:49:24,221 --> 01:49:26,565
Do you know why
KD never got married?

2198
01:49:26,657 --> 01:49:27,658
Let it be.

2199
01:49:27,792 --> 01:49:28,862
Let me speak. - Forget it.

2200
01:49:28,959 --> 01:49:30,199
Let me speak today!

2201
01:49:33,531 --> 01:49:36,569
KD loved someone. - Maybe.

2202
01:49:36,634 --> 01:49:39,274
That girl was your sister Chanchal.

2203
01:49:40,504 --> 01:49:42,313
Interesting, twist in the story.

2204
01:49:42,373 --> 01:49:44,512
Mr. Akshay, wear your glasses.

2205
01:49:50,347 --> 01:49:52,156
He remained a bachelor..

2206
01:49:52,249 --> 01:49:55,958
...for the promise that we'll never
flirt with each other's sister.

2207
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:57,731
The one you're calling cheap..

2208
01:49:57,788 --> 01:50:01,395
"Strangled his love for
the sake of our friendship.

2209
01:50:05,863 --> 01:50:10,107
We were friends, we still are..

2210
01:50:10,801 --> 01:50:12,576
...and we'll still be friends.

2211
01:50:13,137 --> 01:50:14,309
Good or bad.

2212
01:50:14,371 --> 01:50:16,476
We'll always stay together.
Remember?

2213
01:50:18,976 --> 01:50:19,977
Are you crazy?

2214
01:50:20,878 --> 01:50:22,949
You took that childhood
promise so seriously.

2215
01:50:23,948 --> 01:50:26,724
Chanchal got divorced.

2216
01:50:27,384 --> 01:50:30,263
And you're searching
for love in Mauritius.

2217
01:50:30,788 --> 01:50:32,267
You should've told me before.

2218
01:50:34,592 --> 01:50:36,401
You three are great.

2219
01:50:37,027 --> 01:50:38,506
Even after 100 mistakes.

2220
01:50:38,562 --> 01:50:40,633
...your single good
deed won my heart.

2221
01:50:40,764 --> 01:50:41,765
What?

2222
01:50:42,032 --> 01:50:44,774
Come on,
let's rectify our mistakes.

2223
01:50:45,035 --> 01:50:47,413
Come on, I'll help you. - Please.

2224
01:50:51,876 --> 01:50:53,253
How dare you come back?

2225
01:50:53,777 --> 01:50:55,484
Get lost. - Ahana.

2226
01:50:58,249 --> 01:51:00,388
Lali, Pinky and
KD told me every1hing.

2227
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:03,924
I don't know..

2228
01:51:05,522 --> 01:51:07,001
...what I said on stage yesterday.

2229
01:51:07,458 --> 01:51:08,459
I apologize.

2230
01:51:08,559 --> 01:51:09,731
I am really sorry about it.

2231
01:51:10,461 --> 01:51:13,840
You just said "Men are pigs".

2232
01:51:14,665 --> 01:51:15,769
We're not pigs.

2233
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,604
We' re H KP.

2234
01:51:19,403 --> 01:51:21,178
'Hawas Ke Pujari'. - No.

2235
01:51:21,272 --> 01:51:22,478
'Haste Khelte Puppies'.

2236
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:23,841
Just look at them.

2237
01:51:24,608 --> 01:51:25,916
Look at their faces.

2238
01:51:28,979 --> 01:51:34,258
I want you to come for
my press conference tomorrow.

2239
01:51:35,686 --> 01:51:37,688
Don't say no. You have to come.

2240
01:51:39,757 --> 01:51:41,794
Give me a chance to
rectify my mistake, please.

2241
01:51:44,828 --> 01:51:45,829
What's the dress code?

2242
01:51:46,563 --> 01:51:49,100
Formal..or casual?

2243
01:51:50,134 --> 01:51:51,238
That's the spirit?

2244
01:51:51,835 --> 01:51:53,337
Good evening, everyone.

2245
01:51:53,804 --> 01:51:55,249
Few hours ago..

2246
01:51:55,739 --> 01:51:58,879
...I created a big
stir back in India.

2247
01:51:59,376 --> 01:52:00,480
Well, that's what we wanted.

2248
01:52:01,712 --> 01:52:04,659
This was all a well
planned marketing campaign.

2249
01:52:04,815 --> 01:52:06,726
What? - Absolutely.

2250
01:52:06,917 --> 01:52:08,328
This was a marketing campaign..

2251
01:52:08,385 --> 01:52:09,659
...for my next film.

2252
01:52:10,154 --> 01:52:12,395
And the film is called 'Alcoholic'.

2253
01:52:12,489 --> 01:52:13,832
What a name.
What a name.

2254
01:52:16,593 --> 01:52:19,699
And now..those who made
this campaign successful.

2255
01:52:20,497 --> 01:52:24,741
Humiliated themselves
in front of millions of people.

2256
01:52:25,235 --> 01:52:29,581
Let me introduce you to
my three really lovely uncles.

2257
01:52:29,773 --> 01:52:31,377
Meet KD uncle.

2258
01:52:32,443 --> 01:52:33,513
What a fine man.

2259
01:52:33,844 --> 01:52:35,255
I want to tell everyone..

2260
01:52:35,312 --> 01:52:38,259
...KD uncle's responsible
for everything I am..

2261
01:52:38,882 --> 01:52:40,259
"Everything I learnt.

2262
01:52:41,385 --> 01:52:42,489
Thank you, KD uncle.

2263
01:52:42,786 --> 01:52:44,026
Rajiv..l..

2264
01:52:45,189 --> 01:52:46,600
I have no words, son.

2265
01:52:46,957 --> 01:52:48,959
Thank you, son. - So sweet.

2266
01:52:49,393 --> 01:52:50,428
So sweet.

2267
01:52:50,594 --> 01:52:52,904
And that's Lali uncle.

2268
01:52:53,664 --> 01:52:56,304
Fashion, style, class.

2269
01:52:57,167 --> 01:53:00,148
He's my style icon.
Love you, Lali uncle.

2270
01:53:00,337 --> 01:53:01,315
Love you. - Thank you.

2271
01:53:01,372 --> 01:53:07,254
And..the spice King
from Chawdi Bazaar.

2272
01:53:08,145 --> 01:53:09,146
Pinky uncle.

2273
01:53:09,346 --> 01:53:13,624
You all know I am a chef,
I love cooking.

2274
01:53:14,318 --> 01:53:16,559
And it was possible because of him.

2275
01:53:17,654 --> 01:53:18,598
Him.

2276
01:53:18,655 --> 01:53:19,827
Give him a big hand.

2277
01:53:20,591 --> 01:53:22,400
Thank God he was saved.

2278
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:26,336
And now the girl..who
got herself humiliated"

2279
01:53:26,397 --> 01:53:27,876
...in front of millions of people.

2280
01:53:28,165 --> 01:53:29,701
And still stayed strong.

2281
01:53:29,867 --> 01:53:32,905
Please welcome..one and only..

2282
01:53:33,203 --> 01:53:35,183
Ahana Basin.

2283
01:53:39,476 --> 01:53:40,546
Ahana Basin.

2284
01:53:40,711 --> 01:53:43,658
Friends, I would like
to tell you another thing.

2285
01:53:43,814 --> 01:53:47,887
She is in my next film..heroine.

2286
01:53:48,118 --> 01:53:49,222
WOW!

2287
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,024
Akshay, what are you saying?

2288
01:53:51,088 --> 01:53:52,328
I can't act.

2289
01:53:53,424 --> 01:53:55,062
You don't know designing either.

2290
01:53:56,093 --> 01:53:57,834
And anyway,
those who don't know anything".

2291
01:53:57,895 --> 01:53:59,033
...become an actor.

2292
01:53:59,096 --> 01:54:00,734
Look at me..
what is there to laugh about that?

2293
01:54:01,098 --> 01:54:03,544
Take 39..

2294
01:54:08,405 --> 01:54:13,013
Raj..l am pregnant"

2295
01:54:14,378 --> 01:54:15,914
Akshay, I can't do this.

2296
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:20,094
What's my motivation?
- She's impossible.

2297
01:54:22,319 --> 01:54:25,892
"The summer party freaking crazy."

2298
01:54:26,056 --> 01:54:27,865
"I am standing straight
although I'm drunk."

2299
01:54:27,958 --> 01:54:29,869
"Because I am an alcoholic."

2300
01:54:29,993 --> 01:54:31,939
"Yes, I am an alcoholic."

2301
01:54:33,497 --> 01:54:35,875
"Yes, I am an alcoholic."

2302
01:54:37,101 --> 01:54:40,742
"The summer party freaking crazy."

2303
01:54:40,804 --> 01:54:42,784
"Yes, I am an alcoholic."

2304
01:54:42,906 --> 01:54:44,647
"Yes, I am an alcoholic."

2305
01:54:58,956 --> 01:55:00,833
"Alcoholic."

2306
01:55:00,958 --> 01:55:01,959
Chanchal.

2307
01:55:03,861 --> 01:55:04,862
Kamal.

2308
01:55:06,396 --> 01:55:08,205
"Alcoholic."

2309
01:55:08,465 --> 01:55:10,138
Raise the mic.

2310
01:55:10,234 --> 01:55:11,645
I feel like it's
going to fall on me.

2311
01:55:11,702 --> 01:55:13,704
Kunnu, get me a double peg,
on rocks.

2312
01:55:13,871 --> 01:55:16,215
"Alcoholic."

2313
01:55:17,541 --> 01:55:19,987
"Alcoholic."

2314
01:55:21,278 --> 01:55:23,622
"Alcoholic."

2315
01:55:24,948 --> 01:55:26,723
"Alcoholic."

2316
01:55:27,651 --> 01:55:31,258
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2317
01:55:31,321 --> 01:55:32,527
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2318
01:55:32,589 --> 01:55:33,624
I think I need earrings.

2319
01:55:33,690 --> 01:55:35,260
Give me my earrings quickly.

2320
01:55:35,325 --> 01:55:37,601
This is a difficult dialogue.
Can we change it?

2321
01:55:37,661 --> 01:55:39,766
Kunnu, get me something new.

2322
01:55:54,611 --> 01:55:58,115
"I drink alcohol like milk."

2323
01:55:58,382 --> 01:56:01,761
"I always make a
big peg for myself."

2324
01:56:01,985 --> 01:56:05,398
"I drink alcohol like milk."

2325
01:56:05,589 --> 01:56:09,127
"I always make a
big peg for myself."

2326
01:56:09,426 --> 01:56:12,964
"I never measure my peg."

2327
01:56:13,197 --> 01:56:15,473
"I drink from my own money."

2328
01:56:15,532 --> 01:56:16,943
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2329
01:56:17,134 --> 01:56:18,807
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2330
01:56:20,571 --> 01:56:22,551
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2331
01:56:24,274 --> 01:56:27,721
"The summer party freaking crazy."

2332
01:56:27,978 --> 01:56:29,855
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2333
01:56:30,013 --> 01:56:31,390
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2334
01:56:31,448 --> 01:56:33,826
"Alcoholic."

2335
01:56:35,052 --> 01:56:37,225
"Alcoholic."

2336
01:56:38,722 --> 01:56:40,963
"Alcoholic."

2337
01:56:42,492 --> 01:56:44,972
"Alcoholic."

2338
01:56:46,196 --> 01:56:48,335
"Alcoholic."

2339
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:52,041
"Alcoholic."

2340
01:56:53,537 --> 01:56:55,642
"Alcoholic."

2341
01:56:57,274 --> 01:56:59,151
"Alcoholic."

2342
01:56:59,943 --> 01:57:02,685
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2343
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:06,786
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2344
01:57:07,417 --> 01:57:10,193
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2345
01:57:11,822 --> 01:57:15,497
"Baby it's true, I love to party."

2346
01:57:15,559 --> 01:57:19,132
"That's exactly why I've
such a big stock at home."

2347
01:57:19,196 --> 01:57:22,837
"Baby it's true, I love to party."

2348
01:57:22,899 --> 01:57:26,813
"That's exactly why I've
such a big stock at home."

2349
01:57:27,037 --> 01:57:30,610
"I never measure my peg."

2350
01:57:30,741 --> 01:57:33,017
"I drink from my own money."

2351
01:57:33,110 --> 01:57:34,555
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2352
01:57:34,645 --> 01:57:36,420
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2353
01:57:38,148 --> 01:57:40,287
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2354
01:57:41,752 --> 01:57:45,131
"The summer party freaking crazy."

2355
01:57:45,555 --> 01:57:47,296
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2356
01:57:47,557 --> 01:57:49,503
"Yes, I'm an alcoholic."

2357
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:52,271
Okay, one more time.

2358
01:57:55,766 --> 01:57:56,767
I'll chant Om.

2359
01:58:00,771 --> 01:58:07,188
Om!

2360
01:58:08,845 --> 01:58:09,846
I am ready.

2361
01:58:10,514 --> 01:58:14,189
Raj, I am pregnant..with
your child.

2362
01:58:15,385 --> 01:58:16,386
Action.

2363
01:58:17,854 --> 01:58:18,855
Raj"

2364
01:58:20,390 --> 01:58:21,733
I forgot my line.

2365
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:25,367
No, no. I'll do it again.

2366
01:58:26,630 --> 01:58:28,200
Akshay, you don't
mind waiting, right?

2367
01:58:28,699 --> 01:58:31,942
Kunnu, bring me that
snake charmer's basket.

2368
01:58:32,235 --> 01:58:33,407
Shoo those snakes on me.

2369
01:58:33,704 --> 01:58:34,739
They will bite me.

2370
01:58:35,038 --> 01:58:37,018
At least that poison
will give me some fun.

2371
01:58:37,107 --> 01:58:37,812
How's my hair?

2372
01:58:37,874 --> 01:58:39,353
This w**** is driving me crazy.

2373
01:58:39,476 --> 01:58:40,682
I am tired of seeing her.

2374
01:58:41,044 --> 01:58:42,455
Why did I go to Mauritius?

2375
01:58:42,813 --> 01:58:44,554
I'll kill her some day.

2376
01:58:44,614 --> 01:58:46,457
My sari's falling.
