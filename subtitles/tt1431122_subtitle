l said switch off the cameras.

3
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,630
Thank you, Brother.

4
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,102

..is going to be the
center for the whole world.

8
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,581
Welcome, madam.

9
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,558
Get up.

10
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:48,959
Move.

11
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,558
Freeze.

12
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,404
Nobody moves.

13
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,604
Khokha.

14
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,683
Look..

15
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,820
Lara, get the car.

16
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,529
Hey, bossy.

17
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,805
You aren't doing the right thing.

18
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,040
You won't be able to escape.

19
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,913
lf you say anything else..

20
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,052
..then you won't survive, Minister.

21
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,759
Well done.

22
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,963
But you were firing blindly.

23
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,658
What if one of the
bullets had hit me?

24
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,067
You would've died if
Marcos wanted to kill you.

25
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,097
lf l wanted to kill you..
then you wouldn't have survived.

26
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,806
Hey, my camera.

27
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,638
No photography allowed
at the minister's place.

28
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,481
You won't forsake your
passion for direction.

29
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,952
Stop it.

30
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,817
DC.
- Sorry, boss.

31
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,189
Since l was struck by lightening..

32
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,762
..the current is still inside.

33
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,954
But l forget.

34
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,589
Sorry for that.

35
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,034
What next?
- Look, Marcos.

36
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,237
Till the news of the heist
doesn't die down play cool.

37
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,902
You'll get your share
after l make the deal.

38
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,754
''The beautiful ambience.''

39
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,585
''The scenic valleys.''

40
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,183
''Where have we wandered to?''

41
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,023
What a place.

42
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:33,691
What fresh air.

43
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,125
Wonder how people live..

44
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,261
..all their lives in the hustle
and bustle of the city? - Yes.

45
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,563
Yes, Raj. There's
so much peace here.

46
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,532
No tension or problem.

47
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,802
l have a suggestion.

48
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,078
Let's buy a grape orchard.

49
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,248
We'll drink and
serve others as well.

50
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,309
Save me, save me.

51
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,815
Their child is stuck
in my luggage boot.

52
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,015
Get him out.

53
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,751
But how did he get
stuck in your luggage boot?

54
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,919
l'll tell you that later, first
save me. - Okay, we're coming.

55
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,087
What?

56
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,892
We aren't here to do social work.

57
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,630
Look..

58
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,930
..he's a child after all.

59
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,931
Whether it's human or a gorilla.

60
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,234
Keep a smile on your face.

61
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,169
They should think that
we're here to save their child.

62
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,609
Come quickly.

63
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,805
Hello.

64
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,842
Look there.

65
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,884
They're smiling.
They're here to save him.

66
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,213
We're here to help.

67
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,358
We'll get him out.

68
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,934
Thank you. You saved my life.

69
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,171
We didn't save you..
but that gorilla's child.

70
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,338
Aren't you ashamed?

71
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:56,945
You steal baby animals.

72
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,949
No, no, l didn't steal the baby.

73
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,109
There were bananas
in the luggage boot..

74
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,277
..and that's why
the baby climbed in.

75
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,649
And the boot closed shut.

76
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,848
And just like you two,
they thought that l..

77
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,720
Are you two tourists?

78
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,727
ls there a hotel, motel
or a place to stay nearby?

79
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,660
There's nothing around here.

80
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,322
But my village is closeby.

81
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,923
You can spend the night at my house.

82
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,102
l am late.

83
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,701
That's good.

84
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,934
Savitri, see that they
have proper breakfast, okay.

85
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,836
l'm leaving. l am in a hurry.

86
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,070
Bye, darling.

87
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,076
Careful. Careful.

88
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,115
Sister-in-law, you
can speak good Hindi.

89
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,209
Living with him, the entire
village and l have learnt Hindi..

90
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,686
..but we couldn't
learn English yet.

91
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,288
Oh, meet my children.

92
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,291
This is Varun,
he's taken after him.

93
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,187
This is Rosy,
she's taken after me.

94
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,857
And he's Jackson.

95
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,400
Who has Jackson taken after?

96
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,067
Madam. Tea.

97
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,871
Thanks.

98
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,035
You two continue
with your breakfast.

99
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,442
The function has started.

100
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:01,804
Please excuse me.

101
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,179
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've done me a favour..

102
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,277
..by depositing your
hard-earned money in this bank..

103
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:13,347
..and putting your faith in me
and l thank everyone for that.

104
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,156
Pack the luggage.

105
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,822
And l'll get a taxi.
- Okay.

106
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:29,037
Your hard-earned money
is locked in this bank..

107
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:31,302
..and l am the key.

108
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,211
Come on.

109
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,378
What are you staring at?

110
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,217
Run. Quickly.

111
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,120
What have you done

112
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,822
You robbed the bank.
- Yes.

113
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,956
When you speak, it
decreases your speed. Run.

114
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,762
No one will come forward, get that.

115
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,296
You had decided that we
won't do anything wrong.

116
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,736
We were going to change, isn't it?

117
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,501
That's only if the
world lets us change.

118
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,509
The security guard left
the money unattended..

119
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,277
..and was drinking Pepsi.

120
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,437
What could l do?

121
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,142
Sharpen your.. knives and blades!

122
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,047
Sharpen you knives and blades!

123
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:19,121
Sharpen your knives and blades!

124
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,490
Sharpen your knives and blades!

125
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,473
l have a gun.
- Please don't kill me.

126
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,010
Move fast or else l'll kill you.

127
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,840
Raj, quickly.

128
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,441
Bye-bye.

129
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,041
l've made it outside.

130
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,180
Catch them.
- Running won't help..

131
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,989
Catch them.

132
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,983
Thief.

133
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,286
Come on, Dhanno. Move.

134
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,001
Yash, you got me
trapped in a big mess today.

135
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,994
Faster.

136
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,937
How long do you want to
conduct sting operations..

137
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,979
..for petty amounts, petty thief.

138
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,140
l am better off as a petty thief.

139
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,012
Petty thieves get
minor sentences, get that.

140
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,109
l'm locked up for 15
days and then released.

141
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,312
When you get locked up..

142
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,286
..you won't come out for 15 years.

143
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,826
That's why l never got
into a partnership with you?

144
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,823
What are you doing?

145
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,830
Have you gone crazy?
You're throwing away the money.

146
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,196
This is the only way
to stop them, you thief.

147
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,895

184
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,392
''Create an ambience for us.''

185
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,659
''Make my heart beat
as hard as the drums.''

186
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,167
''Lord, l am thankful to you.''

187
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,670
''Now you do justice.''

188
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,366
''We're your devotees after all.''

189
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,410
''Forgive us if we're at fault.''

190
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,139
''Your condition is different.''

191
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,579
''You have a different gait.''

192
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,617
''You have a unique smile.''

193
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,278
''Anyone who sees you
says the same thing.''

194
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,720
''We've hit the jackpot.''

195
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,418
''We're loaded with money.''

196
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,086
''Luck has supported us.''

197
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,188
''And the babes are impressed.''

198
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,215
We thrashed him black and blue..

199
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,615
..even then he didn't say anything.

200
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,118
He didn't utter a word.

201
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,415
Kill him.

202
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,557
Scoundrels. Rascals.

203
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,564
You think l ruined the village.

204
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,725
You. What did you tell the police?

205
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,359
Those thieves are my friends.

206
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,662
l called them from the city.

207
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:34,830
They're my friends!

208
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,399
And you?

209
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:37,801
What were you saying?

210
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,805
That because l couldn't rob
every house in the village..

211
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,841
..l opened a bank
and robbed everyone.

212
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,379
Zandu Lal, l was only doing my duty.

213
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,816
Doing your duty.

214
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,178
Give me the gun. Give me the gun.

215
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,482
Here.
- Here.

216
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,713
That one is empty.

217
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,127
l have only two options left now.

218
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:01,331
Either l murder a few of
you and get locked up again.

219
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,430
Or else l catch those
two scoundrels at Durban..

220
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,504
..and bring them back here.
- Durban?

221
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,367
Yes, they're from Durban.

222
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,198
l found a train ticket for Durban..

223
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,709
..in the bag, which
they had left at my house.

224
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,371
Those two fled, so he'll flee too.

225
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,411
Everything l own is right here.

226
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,208
My wife and children.

227
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,479
My home. Everyone.

228
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,885
Where else will l go if
l don't come back here?

229
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:28,818
Tell me what should l do?

230
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,122
Go to Durban.

231
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,287
Go to Durban.

232
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,455
Go to Durban.

233
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:33,690
Go to Durban.

234
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,210
Sir, did you see anything?

235
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,681
That's it.
- What?

236
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,214
Get ready for action.

237
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,483
l am ready, sir.

238
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:01,854
But, sir, backup hasn't arrived yet.

239
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,451
We can't wait for backup..

240
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,195
..or else diamond thief Marcos
will escape from our clutches.

241
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,330
Carefully.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,413
Sir.

243
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,517
ldiot.

244
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,319
Sir.

245
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,488
Nobody moves.

246
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,825
Super-cop Arjun Singh.
- Oh God.

247
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,765
Out. Out you girls!

248
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,202
lnternational criminal Marcos.

249
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,942
You made a big mistake
by coming to Durban.

250
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,912
Because l am a part of
the police force here.

251
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,306
Everybody, hands up.

252
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,698
l normally don't
engage in an encounter..

253
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,801
..if the criminal gives up easily.

254
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:24,375
l suggest that you
throw down your weapons.

255
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,742
Or else l'll turn this
sea red with your blood.

256
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,280
Open the door.

257
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,351
You're a lucky man, Arjun Singh.

258
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,786
You're fated to die by my hands.

259
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,785
Papa. Papa.
- Grandpa.

260
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,513
ls he fine?
- He survived.

261
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,646
Yes, ma'am. The doctor
has taken 12 bullets..

262
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,486
..out of the 14 that he was hit by.
- 12 bullets.

263
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,856
And the two others? - His
life could've been endangered..

264
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,553
..if they had
tried to take them out.

265
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,960
So..
- Both of them are in the stomach.

266
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,827
But no problem, no problem.

267
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,025
Why, Grandpa?

268
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,528
Are they chocolate toffees..

269
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,296
..that will melt away in
the stomach? - Tuktuk.

270
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,735
No, dear, they won't melt.

271
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,633
But when those bullets
travel in his stomach..

272
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,868
..he will get tickled.
- Tickled?

273
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,035
Yes, tickled.

274
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,437
And because of that..

275
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,945
..he won't be able to
control his laughter..

276
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,447
..irrespective of how tense he is.

277
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,575
- Oh, God. - Commissioner,
l want to talk to you.

278
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,377
Even during the operation, in
a state of unconsciousness..

279
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,991
..Arjun was saying,
''My wife shouldn't find out..''

280
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,559
''..or else they'll shoot me.''

281
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,695
Actually my daughter
Kajal is suffering..

282
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,022
..from a split personality disorder.

283
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,929
But there must be a
big reason behind that.

284
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,092
The reason is inside, Doctor.

285
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:58,627
That fool Arjun.

286
00:18:58,737 --> 00:18:59,863
She thought he's a hero.

287
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,764
But after their marriage..

288
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,899
..she found out that he's
no hero, but a big failure.

289
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,909
That poor girl's
dreams were shattered.

290
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,811
She kept her
frustration in her heart.

291
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,712
And because of that she
developed this ailment.

292
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,915
And now the condition is, Doctor..

293
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:20,447
..that Kajal has fits at
least once a day for ten minutes.

294
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,754
And when she has the fits..

295
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,091
..she wants to kill Arjun.
- Oh no.

296
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,522
Oh yes.

297
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,659
l have to attend an
important meeting.

298
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,732
But my staff is right here.

299
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,903
Excuse me, sir. Time forjuice.

300
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,842
Orange.
- Right.

301
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,072
No one in my family has
ever had orange juice.

302
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:48,441
We only have pomegranate juice.
- Right.

303
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,816
No problem, sir.

304
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,398
Mummy.

305
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,906
You want pomegranate juice?

306
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,475
Has anyone in your family
ever seen a pomegranate?

307
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,175
You're laughing.

308
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,609
Am l joking?

309
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,084
l am not laughing, Kajal.

310
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,449
l mean Kamini.

311
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,750
l am feeling..
ticklish in the stomach.

312
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:26,949
l see.

313
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,960
l'll take care of your tickle.

314
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,428
Or else, because of the
bullets in your stomach..

315
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,930
..you'll keep laughing
in front of my Kajal..

316
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,829
..and that poor
girl will keep crying.

317
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,902
Bullets? ln my stomach.

318
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,801
How could you survive after
being hit by so many bullets?

319
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,438
lf you had died..

320
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,941
..then at least Kajal would've
been free from your clutches.

321
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,806
l will kill you today.

322
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,977
Why did you go to catch
Marcos alone? Tell me.

323
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,950
You're a police officer, but
you got beaten up by criminals.

324
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,540
Weren't you ashamed?

325
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,547
l say.. l say, Kajal.

326
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,850
Kajal, let's forget the past.

327
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,150
l am dead.
- Mummy.

328
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,557
Save me. Save me.

329
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,958
Doctor.
- Boss. But you were bedridden.

330
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,900
O my God!

331
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,540
Sir barely survived.

332
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,813
My wife left me.

333
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,749
l'm not scared of dying.

334
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,084
l feel like jumping
out of this window.

335
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,188
Save me.

336
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,728
Help.

337
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,866
But you wanted to die.

338
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,565
l have small children.

339
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,242
l can't give them a mother's love..

340
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,704
..but l can get them a new mother.

341
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,972
Save me.

342
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,672
Don't move. Someone save him.

343
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:57,840
Please.
- Boss.

344
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,007
Save him.

345
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,587
How did this..

346
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:08,985
What are you doing here?

347
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,755
Actually,
Sister-in-law, there was a storm..

348
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,022
..but luckily sir survived again.

349
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,626
And what are you doing with this?

350
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:16,826
Who brought this?

351
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:17,959
Throw it away.

352
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,029
Who is it?

353
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:22,931
Oh, Lord.

354
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,802
Someone threw a wreath on me
as soon as l entered this city.

355
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,807
Seems like the entire
city knows those rascals.

356
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,642
Come in.

357
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,653
Stand at the back.

358
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,082
Sir.

359
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,986
Yash.
- Get well soon, sir.

360
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:46,755
Thank you, sir.

361
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,595
Congratulations, you survived.
- Thank you.

362
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,672
l don't want your flowers.

363
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,700
Sir, you can accept
his flowers but not mine?

364
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,003
Shut up.

365
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,011
Cheater, thief, blackmailer.

366
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,181
You live with such a great man.

367
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,579
Do some social work.
Do something big.

368
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,914
Be like him.
- l am better off the way l am.

369
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,748
One day you'll die by my hands.

370
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,346
Yash, ask him to get out..
of my sight.

371
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,147
l said go.
- Leave.

372
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,721
Something happens
every time.. l see him.

373
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,956
Control yourself, sir.

374
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,363
lf you move, your
stitches will open up, sir.

375
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,598
Control, sir.
Control, sir. Control.

376
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,901
Hi, Raj.

377
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:30,933
Naughty boy.

378
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,242
Hi, darling.

379
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,374
How are you?

380
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,010
Who's he?
- Rascal.

381
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,948
Congratulations.

382
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,877
Hi.
- Hi.

383
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,623
Raj, you.. here?

384
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,156
You didn't send this
month's installment.

385
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,123
l was slightly busy due to
my brother's engagement.

386
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,991
That's why..
- l thought.. you forgot.

387
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,132
You do remember your promise,
don't you, darling?

388
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:58,259
Of course, you'll
be my next actress.

389
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,667
No. - Congrats!

390
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,863
Thank you.

391
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,667
Why are you showing it again?

392
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,866
l'll.. send it tomorrow.

393
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,772
l get bored after 10
minutes in a party.

394
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,205
Meet me right now.

395
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,907
Sanjana. Sanjana.

396
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,210
Sanjana. Sanjana.

397
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,410
Where are you?

398
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,893
Hi.
- Hi. What's wrong?

399
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,695
All your friends are searching
for you and you're hiding here.

400
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:34,169
The girl who's getting
engaged is my best friend.

401
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,066
l am not her enemy
that l'll go sit there.

402
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,373
Enemy? l didn't understand?

403
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,809
Oh, God.

404
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,438
lf l go and sit there..

405
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,715
..then won't that boy
choose me over my friend.

406
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,976
Your friend is quite
beautiful as well.

407
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,052
l saw her.
- Tell me something.

408
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,081
What would you choose
between a television and plasma?

409
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,347
Plasma.

410
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,788
And between an lndica and Ferrari.
- Ferrari.

411
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:54,950
That is the difference.

412
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,455
She's the
television and l am plasma.

413
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,893
She's lndica and l am Ferrari.

414
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,090
l see.

415
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,061
So you think you're the
most beautiful.. - ''l think.''

416
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,262
What do you mean?

417
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,930
Just a minute

418
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,332
Take a close look at me.

419
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:22,413
You're beautiful, but
not as much as you think.

420
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,753
l have a shack at Sunset beach.

421
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,824
You can find me there everyday.
- What?

422
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,392
You don't find me that beautiful..

423
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,018
..so you won't come there either.

424
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,328
We'll see.

425
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,771
l think that girl's half crazy.
- Oh no, she's completely insane.

426
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,135
But she's made me crazy as well.

427
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,740
Who's creating a
commotion at midnight?

428
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,245
Seems like a new tenant.

429
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,873
He's not visible in the dark.

430
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,075
Hello, my friend?

431
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,215
What's this commotion?
- l am chopping wood.

432
00:25:57,422 --> 00:26:00,152
ls this the time to chop wood?
- lt's cold now..

433
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,249
..so should l chop
wood in the morning?

434
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,191
During the day, l was
shivering with cold.

435
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,287
What if l freeze to death at night?

436
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,059
Will you take me to
the crematorium?

437
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,159
Won't you think about
the neighbors?

438
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,897
The neighbors didn't
think about me.

439
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,097
My heater broke down.

440
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,366
Did anyone lend me another one?

441
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:18,908
These misers didn't even
give me a piece of wood.

442
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,302
You give it.

443
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,004
And l will stop
chopping wood. You give it.

444
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,774
The heater in our
house is working perfectly.

445
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,247
There's no wood in our house.

446
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,910
There must be a chair, sofa,
table.. dining table at home.

447
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,247
Anything at all. Give me that.

448
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,287
l'll manage with that.
- Give it.

449
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,981
See. When l asked
for your furniture..

450
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,389
..you couldn't say a thing.

451
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,951
Hey, should l come down?

452
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:43,197
No. We don't call
strangers home at this hour. Go.

453
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,825
l don't like this man.

454
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:45,994
He can cause us
trouble in the future.

455
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,368
Should l teach him a lesson?
- Forget it.

456
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,298
He's a frustrated man.

457
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,009
He must have some problem as well.

458
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,441
Tell me something.

459
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:01,008
ls that girl really beautiful?
- She is.

460
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,013
But l made a mistake.

461
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,592
l didn't praise her.
- You did the right thing.

462
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,220
The more negative you behave..

463
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,488
..she'll be more impressed.

464
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:12,927
One more thing.

465
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,564
She should think that..

466
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:17,198
..that several girls
are crazy over you.

467
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,309
l knew it.

468
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,078
What is this?

469
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,244
What is this?

470
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:37,446
My heart.

471
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,920
Can't you girls think of anything..

472
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,458
..other than love and heart?

473
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,856
Explain to your friends.

474
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,855
What does he think of himself?

475
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,023
There's something about him..

476
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,494
..that's why 150 girls
are crazy about him.

477
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,406
Excuse me.
- Thank God.

478
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,340
We won't have to give
this month's installment.

479
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,071
Oh God, now you don't say
that you're in love with me.

480
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,409
Please.
- Me, with you?

481
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,609
No way.
- God is great.

482
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,214
At least l found one girl..

483
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,013
..who thinks about
other things than love.

484
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,153
What's bad about her?
- What's good about her?

485
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,485
She thinks she's beautiful.

486
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,526
Beauty should be..
- Like me.

487
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,659
No. You have shortcomings as well.
- Like?

488
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:26,300
Look, your face is fine at the top..

489
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,964
..but the problem starts
as we come down, isn't it?

490
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,108
The nose could be sharper.

491
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,477
Actually, you know beauty
isn't about the face alone.

492
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,918
No, no, it's just about the face.

493
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,480
Look at your face. You
look so handsome. - l know.

494
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:51,187
l am very handsome.
- Bye.

495
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,632
Bye.

496
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,637
Hello.
- Hello, hello, hello.

497
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:09,203
Look.. l am not
responsible for whatever happened.

498
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,645
You are responsible.

499
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,710
Your entire face has been
blackened. - No, no, no.

500
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,315
My friend did it.
- Friend.

501
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:18,547
Those two scoundrels met
me as friends as well..

502
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,352
..and dishonored me in
front of the entire village.

503
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:24,151
And that's why, whenever l
see someone with a black face..

504
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,129
..l see myself.

505
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,358
See. See.

506
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,524
No, no, no.

507
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,367
l will clean it, okay.
- No.

508
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,002
lt's my face. l like it black.

509
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,006
What's your problem?
- l do have a problem.

510
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:40,702
Ever since l've been dishonored,
l hate black faces.

511
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:46,240
You hate black.
- l hate black.

512
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,046
He hates black.

513
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,248
What's wrong with you? What the..

514
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:53,415
He hates black.

515
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,221
No, no, no..
- You hate black.

516
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,522
No, l.. - Obama is the president
of America and you still hate us?

517
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,688
You still hate us.

518
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,596
Look.. l said.. black face.

519
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,268
Not the full body.

520
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,538
He hates black. He hates black.
He hates black.

521
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,166
So bad.

522
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,343
Excuse me, why is there a
crowd gathered around here?

523
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,107
Some Afro-American
people beat up an lndian.

524
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,113
This used to happen in Australia.

525
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:24,513
lt has started here as well.

526
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:25,780
Great.

527
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,124
Seems like he's
been badly beaten up.

528
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,354
Get up, Brother.

529
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:33,521
Get up.

530
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,534
You recognized me?

531
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,040
Who won't recognize an angel?

532
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,043
You're the only one who
stepped forth to help me.

533
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:52,041
Can't you see?
- My sight's distorted.

534
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,144
Those scoundrels
beat me up so badly.

535
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,778
How many fingers?

536
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,684
First take off your socks.

537
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,661
Why are you joking with me?
- That's good.

538
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,697
Come. Let's take you to
the hospital, Zandu Lal.

539
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,460
Just a minute.

540
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,432
How do you know my name?

541
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,795
Your news was in the newspapers.

542
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:17,272
You robbed a bank in the village,
isn't it? - No.

543
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,410
- lt's been published here
as well. - What's going on?

544
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,239
Why is there a crowd?
What's happening?

545
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,144
Clear! Clear!

546
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,305
Come on, move.

547
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,675
Yash. You here? - Sir.

548
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,415
How's your social work?
- Doing fine, sir.

549
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:32,784
And your friend.

550
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,358
That cheater, thief, blackmailer.

551
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,620
What is this, Yash?

552
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,822
You're such a decent man.

553
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,859
Why do you keep the
company of that blackmailer?

554
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,257
Leave him.

555
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:46,326
Sir, can you leave your dog?
- No, no, no way.

556
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,832
So. He's human after all.

557
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,700
l've raised him.

558
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,342
l'm trying to reform him,
sir, and l'll succeed.

559
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:54,206
Hey, you can
reform the world later..

560
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,404
..first take care of my condition.

561
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,140
Yes, come on.
- Sir, l..

562
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,647
No, l am going that way.
l'll drop him there.

563
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,683
Okay, bye.
- Okay, sir.

564
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:01,843
Thank you.

565
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,814
Yash, where were you?

566
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,618
You know Zandu Lal is in the city.

567
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:09,522
You met him as well.
- What do you mean? You too.

568
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,822
This bank heist will
ruin our lives.

569
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,422
Damn this neighbor..

570
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,734
Why are you disposing
your skirt in our house?

571
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,301
Skirt? You're mistaking
my loincloth for a skirt.

572
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,441
l was keeping it out to dry. There
was a gush of wind and it flew away.

573
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:29,536
Hey. Dry your clothes inside.

574
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,673
lf you have a problem
with my wet clothes..

575
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,445
..then l'll send them to your home.

576
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,180
Dry them, iron them and
send it back on a hangar.

577
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,153
Do you think we're washer-men?

578
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,451
What should we do with him?

579
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:41,852
Tear it.
- Tear it?

580
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,222
Tear it.

581
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,894
No, no.

582
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,397
That was my honeymoon loincloth.

583
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,728
Scoundrels.

584
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,167
This city has troubled me a lot.

585
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,433
Oh, God. lt hit him.

586
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:58,668
He's gone today.

587
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,367
l won't spare him.

588
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,906
Why are you hiding inside now?

589
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,342
Come out.

590
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,782
l am not hiding.

591
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,211
l am searching for my gun.

592
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:13,179
l came here to murder two people.

593
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,656
lf l have to kill four,
there's no problem.

594
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,521
Come back, Raj. He's hiding.

595
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,687
l am sparing you for
the sake of my friend.

596
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:22,595
Who are you trying to scare?

597
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,529
Come on, l'll deal
with both of you.

598
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:25,727
Come on.

599
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,436
He's coming. He
will do what he said.

600
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,903
Come down, we're here.

601
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,311
Deal with us.

602
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:41,418
Can't you find the gun?
- l've found my gun but..

603
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,718
Today is Tuesday.

604
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,449
And l don't commit
murders on a Tuesday.

605
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:47,990
You're fortunate.

606
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,916
You survived.

607
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,523
Let's go. Come on.

608
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,788
Firstly, Zandu is in
the city and now him.

609
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,389
Why are you worried?

610
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,364
lt's a big city.
How can he find us?

611
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,300
He'll wander around
for a few days and leave.

612
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:01,895
He isn't hovering
around us, come on.

613
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,397
You.

614
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,864
Why did you all come here?
- We had to.

615
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:34,561
You don't come meet us
or attend our calls.

616
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,367
l have so many things on my plate.

617
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,566
l don't even get time to breathe.

618
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:38,903
But you've got time to play.

619
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,802
Who are you talking to?

620
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:41,970
Mind your language.

621
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,672
Don't shout at Marcos.

622
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:50,778
Marcos, you've been
working with us for years.

623
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,681
Why are you so impatient today?

624
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,916
Those diamonds are worth millions.

625
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:55,953
lt can change anyone's intentions.

626
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,395
And it's been so long
since l gave you the diamonds.

627
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,020
Marcos, it's a big deal.

628
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,764
lt's bound to take time.
- Two days.

629
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:03,924
l give you only two days.

630
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:09,637
The third day.. will be your last.

631
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,715
This man can be a problem for you.

632
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:28,456
And you know l don't like problems.

633
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,932
Richard, l need your
casino at any cost.

634
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:43,941
Marcos, the Riveir is the most
expensive casino in all of Vegas.

635
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,000
You'll get your money in two days.

636
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,407
Two days.

637
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,410
Go, go.
- Move, come on.

638
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:01,491
Boss, they are minister's men. Run.

639
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,957
Come on. Come on. Come on, fast.

640
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,584
Come on. Come on, fast.

641
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,629
Seems like the
movie has started, sir.

642
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,465
Listen to the sound quality, Naidu.

643
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,596
lt seems like
someone's shooting outside.

644
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,136
Someone is really shooting.

645
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,039
But we don't have backup again, sir.

646
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,773
We don't need it.

647
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,113
Come on. Move fast. Naidu.

648
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,958
Sir, sir, sir, sir.

649
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,052
Naidu. Naidu.

650
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,894
Superman. Naidu.

651
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,702
Sir, bullets are being
fired from both sides, sir.

652
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,933
lf l get hit l will die, sir.

653
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,010
Please cover me, sir.

654
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,705
lf l cover you, who will cover me?

655
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,941
Sir, you're used to taking bullets.

656
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,617
There are already
two bullets inside.

657
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,777
lt won't make a difference if
you're hit by a few more, sir.

658
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,851
Come on, move. Move. Move. Move.

659
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,688
Help! Help!

660
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,590
Help!

661
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:30,673
Marcos.

662
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:37,781
Thank you, thank you.

663
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,583
Sir!
- Get lost.

664
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,650
Sir.

665
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:50,161
Sir, any amount of
praise is less for you.

666
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:55,198
lt seems like a lion is
holding its prey in its claws.

667
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:59,099
Yash, Arjun caught Marcos.

668
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,144
Strange. Even l
couldn't understand that.

669
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:03,679
Yes, sir. l am coming tomorrow.

670
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,107
And l am completely assured..

671
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,945
..that you'll take
care of me for good.

672
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,583
Thank you. Thank you.

673
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,816
''l won't leave you today..''

674
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,556
Excuse me, there's
a power failure..

675
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:17,889
..and l can't see
anything in the dark.

676
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,197
My house is closeby.
Will you take me there?

677
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:21,723
l have an important work tomorrow.

678
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:22,890
l need to leave early.

679
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,797
Come.
- Thank you.

680
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,132
By the way, what's the job..

681
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,172
..that's making you jump with
joy even before it's finished?

682
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,542
Two people are
going to die tomorrow.

683
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,242
Two people are going to die.
- Yes.

684
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,638
And you're celebrating.
- Why shouldn't l?

685
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,846
They were both rascals.

686
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,611
They came to my
village and robbed my bank.

687
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,523
lt's him. lt's him.
- What?

688
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,888
l mean.. Uncle, how
did you find out..

689
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,585
..that those two
rascals live in this city?

690
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,926
Those fools.. left
their bag in my house.

691
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,965
You left the bag there?
- Yes.

692
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,896
And tomorrow those two
will be in my clutches.

693
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,971
How is that?
- Their photographs were in the bag.

694
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,164
There were photographs in the bag?
- Yes.

695
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,968
No.
- No, he's right.

696
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,167
There weren't any
photographs in the bag.

697
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,107
l remember their faces clearly.

698
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,813
l've captured it in my eyes,
like a wounded snake does.

699
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,616
l thought of getting their
sketches made by an artist.

700
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,881
But Mr. Arjun advised me that..
- Who Mr. Arjun?

701
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,988
Police inspector Mr. Arjun.

702
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,780
He's a famous inspector.

703
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,653
He said, ''Don't worry, don't worry.''

704
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:25,752
''The police records
have the photographs..''

705
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,262
''..of all the
criminals of the city.''

706
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,696
Come home and l'll show it to you.

707
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,096
lt must surely have my photograph.

708
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,201
Feels like l've come to my home.

709
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,703
That's the one. That's the one.

710
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,567
You live in that house?

711
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,736
And that house which you see..

712
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,634
That's where those
two scoundrels live.

713
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,936
Come out!

714
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,747
You dare call my loincloth a skirt!

715
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,615
Tomorrow l am going
to see the inspector..

716
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,743
..and turn your pants into a skirt.

717
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,112
Yes.

718
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,783
Once l get hold of
those two scoundrels..

719
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,052
..then l'll deal with these two.

720
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,020
Thank you. Thank you.

721
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,221
Good night.

722
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:04,893
When he finds out
we'll have nowhere to run.

723
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,799
Madam, where should l
throw this bouquet? - Throw it?

724
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,166
Keep it here.

725
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:15,245
What's wrong, Naidu?
- My photo wasn't published.

726
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,338
Of course it will be published.

727
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,376
You do something brave as well.

728
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,307
What did sir do?

729
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,380
We fell on Marcos together.

730
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,347
Fell on him, what do you mean?

731
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,747
Marcos was lying unconscious.

732
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:31,324
Sirjust kept his feet on
him and got his photos clicked.

733
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,691
l was there as well.

734
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,128
But he pushed me away.

735
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,191
Look.

736
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,792
That half-a-head you see is mine.

737
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,035
..did something brave..

738
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,081
Mr. Zandu Lal, you came to the
right place. Yourjob will be done.

739
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,277
Thank you.

740
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,420
Oh, God.
- What happened?

741
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,950
As soon as l thought of
those two scoundrels..

742
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:05,187
..their images
flashed before my eyes.

743
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,124
lt seemed as if they
just walked past this way.

744
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,234
Which way?
- This way. Behind you.

745
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,397
What's the point of stealing here?

746
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,297
That's how the inspector will be
degraded in front of Zandu Lal.

747
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,034
He's been rewarded handsomely..

748
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,734
..for capturing Marcos.
- Yes.

749
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,004
The money is in this safe.

750
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:25,838
l admit it wasn'tjust difficult,
but impossible to catch Marcos.

751
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,143
But l.. l've been
planning for the past one year.

752
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,413
Hello, Sister-in-law. Hello.

753
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,349
You're fortunate to have a husband
like him. - lt was my duty, sir.

754
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:34,754
He isn'tjust your husband but God.

755
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:35,985
Look.

756
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,424
He's a brave man. A brave man.

757
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:38,820
Look.

758
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,755
Sister-in-law.
- Why you..

759
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,799
What's this?

760
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,297
From which angle does he look brave?

761
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,872
Brave. - No. No.

762
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,001
Run. Run. Hide. - Help!

763
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,073
lnside the cupboard.

764
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,784
Hide quickly, hide.

765
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,011
Not there.

766
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,882
lnside. Quickly.

767
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:06,115
Help! Help!

768
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,054
Help!
- Open the door.

769
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,758
There's place here.

770
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,159
Only for one, come on.
- Okay.

771
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,927
What's going on outside?

772
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,128
Sister-in-law has been
graced by the 'Devi' (Goddess).

773
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:22,430
Which one? Sridevi.

774
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,871
The Goddess of death.

775
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,305
Papa, quiet.

776
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:33,475
Bullets are speaking.

777
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,757
Seems like she's in this room.

778
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,893
Throw him out.
- Who? Who?

779
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,155
You.

780
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,095
Help! Help!

781
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,214
How much more will you deceive me?

782
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:11,320
Kajal made sweet porridge and you..

783
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:13,915
Eat the porridge.

784
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,286
lt's hot. lt's hot.

785
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:18,088
Eat it hot.
- Eat it, Papa.

786
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:21,323
Eat it, Papa.
- Otherwise we'll have to have it.

787
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,226
Eat it.

788
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,395
Eat some more.

789
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:36,838
Why are you eating like this?

790
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,241
And so hot. - She's fine now.

791
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,874
l'll feed you properly.

792
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,549
Ma'am.

793
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,012
There's been a robbery.
- There's been a robbery.

794
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,282
What? Robbery?

795
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:50,959
Papa, there's been a robbery.

796
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,392
The reward for
catching Marcos is gone.

797
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:55,497
lnform the police.
- Police?

798
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:56,861
Yes, police.

799
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,401
You're a police inspector
and l am the commissioner.

800
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,337
We'll be defamed.

801
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,973
Brother, you need more help.

802
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:09,540
At least keep a dog that
barks on seeing the thieves..

803
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,909
..and not when they leave.

804
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,844
And keep some bodyguards too..

805
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,847
..who can protect
you from your wife.

806
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:19,051
And stop publishing fake
photographs in the newspapers.

807
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,553
People get happy pointlessly.

808
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:23,152
Brave man.

809
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,419
You're not even half the man.

810
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,293
Police officer.

811
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:28,524
You aren't worthy of
being in the post office.

812
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:34,162
Whenever Kajal turns into
Kamini l have to face slander.

813
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,872
lf l didn't love Kajal..

814
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,234
..l would've strangled her to death.

815
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,244
What's wrong? Why are you laughing?

816
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,145
Ms. Universe's photo
has been published.

817
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,618
Look.

818
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,021
They make just anyone..
Ms. Universe.

819
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,148
Somebody help! Somebody help!

820
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:56,383
Wait girls.

821
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,961
Somebody stop them.

822
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,290
Oh, my God.

823
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:04,663
Stop! O God! Stop!
Somebody stop them.

824
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,534
Somebody help!

825
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,601
l want to die. Leave me.
- Come out, come out.

826
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,474
No, l don't want to live.
- Why do you want to die?

827
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,570
Leave me.
- Come out.

828
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:19,406
Shut up!

829
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:22,052
Why are all you girls
committing mass suicide?

830
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,351
Because of him.

831
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,525
All of us love him so much.

832
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:33,151
And today we found out
that he loves some Sanjana.

833
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,156
Sanjana.
- Yes.

834
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,256
He says she's the most
beautiful girl in the world.

835
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,494
Look at me. What's missing in me?

836
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:41,001
l am Ms. Durban.

837
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,198
How did you become?

838
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,003
What?

839
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,442
l mean how did you get fooled?

840
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,571
What's so special about him?
- Take a closer look.

841
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,012
He's got everything.

842
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:55,147
My heart starts
pounding in his presence.

843
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,943
But if he loves Sanjana..

844
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,043
..then why hasn't he told her yet?

845
00:45:58,155 --> 00:45:59,247
He will tell her.

846
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,153
Do you know about
his ego, his arrogance?

847
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,353
He'd rather die
than say 'l love you'.

848
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,189
Sanjana will have to say it.

849
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,003
Come on, round them up. - Come on.

850
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,629
Break it up, come on break it up.

851
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,333
Freeze. Catch them.

852
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,103
Come on, take them inside.

853
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:27,243
Sir, l am not one of them.

854
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,118
l come from a decent home.
- l see.

855
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,478
Where is your home?

856
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:34,022
'lf this scoundrel
finds out the truth..'

857
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,648
'..then l'll have to spend
the entire night in prison.'

858
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,355
You're from a decent
family and you don't go home.

859
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:42,154
Tell me, would you
prefer the lock-up or my home?

860
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,626
Sir? - Don't worry, my
wife's visiting her parents.

861
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:51,333
Don't stare, Naidu, you
know l am a decent man.

862
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,543
But.. my girlfriend before Kajal..

863
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:59,041
..looked.. just like her.

864
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,645
Come, baby. Come.

865
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,617
Your girlfriend was manly.

866
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,790
Careful, the wig might come off.
- What?

867
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,799
l mean.. l might go out of breath.

868
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:27,371
Oh my.. that's the
grace which.. wives lack.

869
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,438
Come.

870
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,181
My dear..

871
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:37,313
You have a beautiful
wife and a cute child.

872
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:40,053
Why do you men always do this?

873
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,825
Men are dogs.
- Yes.

874
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,819
But l am helpless.

875
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:50,700
l haven't received my
wife's love for years.

876
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,132
What?

877
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:55,066
One day we were making love..

878
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:56,806
..and she had a fit.

879
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,630
Split personality.

880
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,713
l didn't realize
when she broke my head..

881
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,308
..when blood starting oozing out.

882
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,710
After that day, l couldn't muster
up the courage to go up to my wife.

883
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,754
Oh my.

884
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,821
You're really very sad.

885
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:19,351
Come on, come on. Come.

886
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,227
We'll see what happens.

887
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,158
What do you mean by
'we'll see what happens'?

888
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,199
l have AlDS.

889
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,236
AlDS.

890
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:33,801
Where are you going?

891
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,640
To switch off the lights?
- No, Sister.

892
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,574
To get a taxi for you?

893
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,115
Yes, yes, yes.

894
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:44,880
Surprise.

895
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,656
How did you come back home?

896
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,453
And Tuktuk?
- What could l do?

897
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:50,685
l was getting bored without you.

898
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:52,321
But that Tuktuk..

899
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,294
She insisted on
staying with her grandpa.

900
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,490
So l left her there.

901
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,157
Anyway, l'll freshen up.

902
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:59,632
Don't go inside.
- Why?

903
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,567
There's someone inside.
- Who?

904
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,537
Sister. l mean she's my sister.

905
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:05,905
Sister? What do you mean?

906
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:07,301
Hey!

907
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,146
He's your sister?

908
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:13,781
l am his friend, Sister-in-law.

909
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,650
Actually he doesn't have a sister.

910
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,617
Once l tied him the
sacred thread of 'Rakhi'.

911
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:19,914
Since then he's been
calling me his sister.

912
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,582
Thanks for the clothes, Arjun.

913
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:22,750
Mine got slightly spoiled.

914
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:24,285
So nice to meet you.
- Yes.

915
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:25,861
l am leaving.
- Nice meeting you.

916
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,865
l am your father, get that.

917
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:32,496
Okay.
- Okay.

918
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:34,326
Bye.
- Bye.

919
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:42,769
Hi, Raj.

920
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:44,870
Aren't you attending the wedding?
- Whose wedding?

921
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,442
Sanjana's.

922
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,408
Come on, we're getting late.

923
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:49,610
Let's go, let's go.

924
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,622
Sanjana.

925
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,470
Hi.

926
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,546
Hi.
- Sorry, for this. - lt's okay.

927
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:21,240
You didn't invite
me to your wedding.

928
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:22,782
lt all happened so suddenly.

929
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:24,649
l forgot to invite so many friends.

930
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,284
Who is the lucky one?

931
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,520
He's your choice. Must be handsome.

932
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,588
No, he's okay.

933
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:32,857
You can consider it as a compromise.

934
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,362
Compromise?
- Of course.

935
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,799
There's no one made for me.

936
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,662
But he has one quality.

937
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,670
He doesn't have an ego or arrogance.

938
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:47,233
All the time he just keeps saying,
''l love you, Sanjana.''

939
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:48,603
Just because he says 'l love you'..

940
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,804
..you agreed to marry him?

941
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,245
No, he does.
- Even l..

942
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:54,681
Yes, you were saying something.

943
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:56,845
lt's too late.

944
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,443
We aren't married yet.

945
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,620
lt can be cancelled as well.

946
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:03,393
What?
- You don't know me.

947
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:04,824
l am very crazy.

948
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:07,622
And if l find someone better,
who loves me more..

949
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,596
..then why not.

950
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,929
Sanjana, l..l also really love you.

951
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:15,264
Really.
- Yes, l love you very much.

952
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,970
But how did you suddenly..
- Not suddenly.

953
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:21,338
Remember when we met the first time.

954
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:24,708
''Television,
plasma. lndica, Ferrari.''

955
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,041
That's when it happened.

956
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,442
l swear that l love you.

957
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,050
He said, ''l love you.''

958
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,286
Let me get married now.

959
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:35,416
She's getting married.

960
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:36,856
l asked her to get
two gowns stitched.

961
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,550
l have to make
someone say l love you.

962
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,820
Come on.

963
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,727
She really is crazy.

964
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,565
Papa, Raj is here.

965
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:51,340
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

966
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,499
Come in.

967
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:56,037
Did you have to fall for
the commissioner's daughter?

968
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:57,573
Commissioner?

969
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:58,875
You petty thief, have you ever..

970
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:01,448
..seen anyone other than
the constable or inspector?

971
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:05,516
l am Yash. Raj's elder brother.

972
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:06,781
Raj? Yash Raj.
- No, no, no.

973
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,824
We don't have any
connection with them.

974
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:11,460
We're Ambani's.
- Ambani's.

975
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:14,359
No, no, we don't have any
connection with them either.

976
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:16,391
They're lndians
and we're foreigners.

977
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,831
NRl's.
- Oh, l see.

978
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:19,026
Sit down, sit down.

979
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,467
Papa, Raj was saying..

980
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,037
..that he'll buy Reliance
as soon as we get married.

981
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:26,934
Sit down, sir.

982
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:30,739
Hello, sir. - Hello!

983
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:35,346
You?

984
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,416
Ram Lal, you didn't
come see me this month.

985
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,484
l haven't received my salary yet.

986
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,488
You know my servant.

987
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,719
Actually my younger
brother does social work.

988
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,793
He has sympathy for poor people.

989
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:50,430
Like servants, maids,
cooks, driver.

990
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,434
He's the support system
of the poor.

991
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:53,861
He takes away their money.

992
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,664
To make a fixed deposit.

993
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,967
l can't believe it.

994
00:52:58,542 --> 00:52:59,668
Do you have poison?

995
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:00,868
Will cyanide do?

996
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:02,410
lt will do fine.

997
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,147
Let's mix it in Raj's
milkshake and give it to him.

998
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,074
Grandpa. Grandpa.

999
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:09,451
Sister and
brother-in-law are here as well.

1000
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,556
Yash.

1001
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,659
Only God can save you now.

1002
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:20,954
Where did he go?

1003
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,631
My brother is very religious.

1004
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:24,594
When he sees a temple..

1005
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,692
Yash, you?
- Sir.

1006
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:28,695
You know him.

1007
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:32,067
Kajal, he's a big
social worker of the city.

1008
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:34,837
Greetings. - You were saying that
your brother is a social worker.

1009
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,003
He too, sir.

1010
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,044
He's a smaller one,
and l am slightly bigger.

1011
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:40,412
Save me from this
rascal today, God.

1012
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,178
Yash, you never told me that
you have a younger brother.

1013
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,883
You never asked me, sir.

1014
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:45,913
Sir.

1015
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:47,887
l swear on Sanjana, l will
stop everything from today.

1016
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,117
Stealing, blackmailing..

1017
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,854
You're getting the most
beautiful girl in the world..

1018
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,759
..what else are you asking God for?

1019
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,558
You!

1020
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:01,569
Scoundrel, rascal, how dare you!

1021
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,469
'Oh my.. that's the
grace which.. wives lack.'

1022
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,903
l have the entire clip.

1023
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:11,670
You carry out raids and
take cheap woman home.

1024
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,806
Sanjana!
- Quiet!

1025
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,541
lf you say anything
else l will beat you.

1026
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:16,845
You never come to see your friend.

1027
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:22,151
And he's here to ask for my
sister-in-law's hand in marriage.

1028
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,624
And without telling me.

1029
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,691
Kajal, did you recognize him?
- l know.

1030
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:28,491
Of course she'll recognize me.
- How are you, Sister-in-law?

1031
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,826
Hi. My God.

1032
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:30,991
That's surprising.

1033
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,591
Everyone knows each other.

1034
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,862
l know him too. There's
another one coming for you.

1035
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:36,768
This is special for Raj.

1036
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,202
Raj, this is for you especially.

1037
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:40,635
You forgot, didn't you, Ram Lal?

1038
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:44,145
lt's Sunday today.
lt's my day of fasting.

1039
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:47,116
'Scoundrel, curse you.'

1040
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:48,514
Sit down, sit down.
Please sit down.

1041
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,210
'lf this scoundrel becomes
a part of this family..'

1042
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,180
'..he'll ruin everyone.'

1043
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:55,487
The commissioner doesn't see
anyone without an appointment.

1044
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:56,951
Okay, will you do me a favor?

1045
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:59,926
Will you deliver these
two photographs to him?

1046
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,122
These two are inside.

1047
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,689
Yes.

1048
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,866
And sir's younger daughter
is getting married to him.

1049
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:12,905
So, is this final?
- No problem from my side.

1050
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:14,643
Just Kajal and Arjun..

1051
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:15,902
What do you say, Arjun?

1052
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,513
l..l was thinking, Father..

1053
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:20,909
Thank God, it didn't break.

1054
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,074
Whatever is inside is safe. Safe.

1055
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:24,517
You were thinking about something.

1056
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:25,713
What's there to think?

1057
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,086
We often lose good
boys if we think.

1058
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,587
Like you.

1059
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:30,887
That's means this
alliance has been finalized.

1060
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,757
Let's have sweets.

1061
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,727
Have sweets.
- These are fritters.

1062
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,126
Oh, sorry, sorry.

1063
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:38,025
Have sweets.

1064
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:39,567
Have sweets.

1065
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:47,100
What?

1066
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,541
What are you staring at?

1067
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,042
What did you think?

1068
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:54,048
You will run away from the
village and come to the city..

1069
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,811
..and l won't find you two.

1070
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,818
You..
- Me. l am..

1071
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,753
Uncle. Uncle.
- Uncle.

1072
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,290
Uncle, we love you.

1073
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,184
Nephew. Nephew.

1074
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:05,953
What did you think?

1075
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:07,324
Uncle must be dead.

1076
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,095
You two came here to
talk about your alliance.

1077
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,291
You didn't even tell me.

1078
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,728
We made a mistake, uncle.
- Mistake, mistake. - lt hurts.

1079
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,334
Uncle, aren't you the one..

1080
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:19,841
..whose bank was robbed by
two scoundrels? - Yes, yes.

1081
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,704
Did you find them?
- l found them.

1082
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:23,973
The money?
- l'll get that as well.

1083
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,272
lt's fine if they
give it peacefully.

1084
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,148
Otherwise, l've got the
police department with me.

1085
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:31,345
We'll hang them
upside down and beat them.

1086
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:32,916
Heard that. Heard that.

1087
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,183
Uncle, let's not talk about this.

1088
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,588
Meet your daughter-in-law.

1089
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,753
Hello, Uncle.
- Bless you, dear.

1090
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:42,629
When have you
scheduled the engagement for?

1091
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,063
Tomorrow is Sanjana's birthday.

1092
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,657
With your permission tomorrow..

1093
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,600
Fine, fine, fine. l accept.

1094
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:56,801
You exist. You exist.

1095
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,075
l had lost faith in You.

1096
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,045
But He's there.
- Yes, He's there..

1097
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:10,090
Sometimes human beings
go crazy with happiness.

1098
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:11,717
Also with sorrow.

1099
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:13,253
Even l did.

1100
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:21,360
First tell me.. where is my money?

1101
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,033
We spent it.

1102
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:26,032
You spent it.

1103
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,003
All of it?

1104
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,179
Actually, Uncle, we
robbed only one bank.

1105
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:34,114
lf we had robbed two or four banks..

1106
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:35,309
..we would've spent that as well.

1107
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:36,845
We're big spenders .

1108
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:42,991
How will he get engaged?

1109
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,059
Uncle, don't drag my
engagement into this.

1110
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:49,287
You're already in this
and so is your engagement.

1111
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:53,994
Raj, there's just one
way to stop his laughter.

1112
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:57,032
No. No, l won't steal.

1113
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,233
He won't steal..

1114
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:01,037
Where are you going?

1115
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:02,437
Stay here and talk to me.

1116
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:05,804
Yash, l just swore
on Sanjana inside..

1117
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,906
..that l won't do anything
wrong again after today.

1118
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,684
After today.
- Yes.

1119
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:12,046
This day won't end
until 12 o'clock midnight.

1120
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,246
We'll finish the job by 1 1 o'clock.

1121
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:16,317
Listen.

1122
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:18,155
l have a foolproof plan..

1123
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,354
..of stealing at
the minister's house.

1124
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,023
Uncle.
- Yes.

1125
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,393
You go home and we'll get the money.

1126
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:30,898
Home?

1127
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:36,110
You don't know my home.
l don't know your home.

1128
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,241
Uncle.. - Don't try to
fool me. Go fool someone else.

1129
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,916
Until l get my money..

1130
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:50,322
..l am going to tail
you two like your shadow.

1131
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:51,919
Understand.

1132
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:55,322
Think that l am your boss now.

1133
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:59,433
And you'll do as l say. Get that?

1134
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:01,895
Okay.
- Okay, boss.

1135
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,097
Okay.

1136
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,100
See that.

1137
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:13,145
Criminal Marcos commits
suicide in jail. Funny.

1138
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:15,149
For the last time l'm asking you,
where are the diamonds?

1139
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:17,785
Or else this will be
tomorrow's breaking news.

1140
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:19,145
How's that?

1141
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,315
You'll be finished.

1142
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,318
Funny.

1143
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:55,556
Take us out now. Quick.

1144
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,400
Stop them! He's Marcos!

1145
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,380
You said there are just two dogs.

1146
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:27,949
Where did the third one come from?

1147
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:30,445
The third one must be new. Come on.

1148
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:34,148
We climbed up a 40-feet
wall and the gate is open.

1149
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:36,157
Look. ls that the guard?

1150
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,618
He's sleeping.

1151
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:39,952
lf he's sleeping,
go wake him up. Go.

1152
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,237
Your saviours are dead.

1153
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:53,433
Marcos.

1154
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:56,103
Please.

1155
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:05,245
Marcos.

1156
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,493
The minister has a bank
right here in his house.

1157
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:47,596
Yash, l suggest that you
take only what we need.

1158
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:49,289
Here, go and count it.

1159
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:50,490
We won't count.

1160
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,726
Did you count
while robbing the bank?

1161
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:54,264
l am the manager, l know
this was the amount. Take it.

1162
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:57,970
Where are the diamonds?

1163
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:00,064
Upstairs, in the safe.

1164
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,568
Give it.

1165
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:03,270
Give it.
- Look, boss.

1166
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,208
You'll have to take
the evening flight..

1167
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:07,305
..to your village, instead
of the morning train. - Why?

1168
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,610
Tomorrow's my engagement.

1169
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:10,549
What will people say?
''Where is uncle?''

1170
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,318
Then l'll have to
attend your wedding as well.

1171
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:15,454
There's time for the wedding.

1172
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,453
We'll say that uncle is dead.

1173
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:20,386
Seems like someone's coming.

1174
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:21,588
lf someone's coming
then let's run. Run.

1175
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,060
Come on.
- Bring him.

1176
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:33,734
Marcos.

1177
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,201
Marcos.

1178
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,144
Marcos.

1179
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:39,209
Marcos, there's been a robbery.
- What?

1180
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:41,348
Marcos, there's been a robbery.

1181
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:43,485
Someone took my money
along with the diamonds?

1182
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:47,620
l know you'll make excuses.

1183
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:51,420
l've committed mass
bloodshed for these diamonds.

1184
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,789
And now you say, ''Marcos, my
belongings have been stolen..''

1185
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:55,393
''..along with the diamonds.''

1186
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,658
Do we.. look like idiots?

1187
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:01,170
l want my diamonds.

1188
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,464
l want my diamonds.
- Marcos.

1189
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,640
l want it!

1190
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:07,541
l want it!

1191
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:09,440
Stop him.

1192
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:12,080
Marcos, stop. What are you doing?
- l want it.

1193
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,546
He'll die.
- l want it.

1194
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:15,310
lf he dies, we
won't get the diamonds.

1195
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,649
We won't get the diamonds.

1196
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:21,717
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, old man.

1197
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,217
Sorry.

1198
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,659
DC. Give him a jolt.

1199
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:30,163
Come here, Minister. No.

1200
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,137
Get up.

1201
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:43,837
Boss, he's dead.

1202
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,712
He's dead. Boss..

1203
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:53,652
Boss, you told me so.

1204
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:55,155
l told you to give him a jolt..

1205
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,089
..l could've killed him too, fool.

1206
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:00,659
Boss. Boss.

1207
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:05,360
You can't die.

1208
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:08,503
We're ruined.

1209
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:12,196
lt was a mistake, boss.

1210
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:15,639
Why are you crying like that?

1211
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,110
Was he your father?
- No.

1212
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:21,681
Did he have to die today?

1213
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,886
Police officials have a personal
life as well. - Definitely, sir.

1214
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,346
Sanjana is getting engaged.

1215
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:28,855
There's so much to do and..
he's lying here.

1216
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:30,624
Tell me, did you
find the murder weapon..

1217
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,861
The wire they used
to electrocute him?

1218
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,687
No, sir. The murderer
didn't leave behind any clue.

1219
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:38,892
Naidu. Criminals first
leave evidence behind..

1220
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:40,896
..and then commit the crime.

1221
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,296
You only need the eyes to see it.

1222
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,608
Sir. Sir.

1223
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:52,574
Sir. Sir.

1224
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:54,405
What, sir?

1225
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,411
Did you think that l fell?
- Yes.

1226
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:58,382
l intentionally went inside.

1227
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:00,714
To take this.

1228
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,158
Whoever opened this safe..

1229
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:04,620
..his picture must be in this.

1230
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:07,228
Get it developed and
meet me there directly.

''Drink country or English.''

1242
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:37,241

your intoxicating eyes.''

Yash, why are the
police coming towards us?

1263
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:37,931
You're going to be the
commissioner's son-in-law.

1264
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:41,740
So the police are
bound to congratulate you.

1265
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:53,715
What's this joke, Mr. Arjun?

1266
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,081
What have we done?

1267
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:57,649
Minister Sanyal's murder.

1268
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:59,019
Murder? - What?

1269
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:00,651
Murder?

1270
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,455
Mr. Arjun, we didn't
commit any murder.

1271
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:03,896
We only went there to steal.

1272
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:05,466
What nonsense are you speaking?

1273
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:06,728
They're accusing us of murder..

1274
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:08,063
..that's why l am
telling them the truth.

1275
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:09,535
Shut up. Shut up, please.

1276
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,137
He's gone crazy with happiness.
- Yes.

1277
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:16,911
Mr. Arjun, you know
what a decent man l am.

1278
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:19,513
Decent? This is your decency.

1279
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,083
Take these glasses off.

1280
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,145
Let me see your real face.

1281
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:29,950
Boss.

1282
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:34,418
Uncle? So you're their boss.

1283
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:37,693
No, l am neither their
uncle nor their boss.

1284
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:39,424
l am total loss, sir.

1285
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:42,537
My wife, children, and the
entire village is waiting for me.

1286
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:44,703
And it's time for my flight as well.

1287
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:45,899
Sir, please let me go.

1288
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:47,100
l haven't done anything.

1289
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:53,109
Look, sir. Take a look yourself.

1290
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:54,807
We only committed a
robbery and not murder.

1291
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,980
Mr. Arjun, you've
known me for years.

1292
01:10:57,219 --> 01:11:00,052
l am a petty thief, l
blackmail people. Remember.

1293
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,553
Remember, sir.

1294
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:05,993
Tell that to the court
and not here.

1295
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,585
Take them away. - Yes, sir.

1296
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:09,789
Sister, look what
brother-in-law has done.

1297
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:15,534
You knew that.. he was a thief,
a blackmailer..

1298
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:19,472
..but still you..
- Papa, l say let's forget the past.

1299
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:22,576
And think that l took the
right action at the right time..

1300
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:23,770
..and saved Sanjana's life.

1301
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:26,871
You ruined it as well, rascal.

1302
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:29,142
Wait!

1303
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:30,718
Take me along.

1304
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:32,745
Take me along.

1305
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:34,855
Arjun.

1306
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:38,085
What a break!

1307
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:56,540
Until yesterday l
had only robbed a bank.

1308
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:58,779
And today l've also
committed a murder.

1309
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:01,672
A minister's murder.

1310
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:06,578
Boss, you're confessing
in front of the police.

1311
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:09,624
Did you commit the murder?
- l didn't rob the bank either.

1312
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:11,817
But l've been accused of it.

1313
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:15,019
Scoundrels. l'm stuck
in this because of you.

1314

You two got me stuck in this.

1315
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:19,734
lt's your bank which he
robbed and l got stuck in it.

1316
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:23,794
l was getting engaged,
but instead l got arrested.

1317
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:28,468
You're putting the
entire blame on me.

1318
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:30,538
You wanted that crazy girl.

1319
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:31,704
You wanted the money.

1320
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,476
And l am stuck in all this,
trying to save you two.

1321
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,878
l know that we three are stuck.

1322
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,711
But l don't understand..

1323
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,551
..who's
responsible for it after all?

1324
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,752
Why did it stop?

1325
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,191
Spot (Spot-boy). Call everyone.
- There's a shooting going on.

1326
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:48,224
Here, have sweets. Here.

1327
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:51,158
That rascal
blackmailer has been arrested.

1328
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:53,894
And his friend. The decent
one who wore spectacles.

1329
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,230
He turned out to be a bigger conman.

1330
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,095
Murderer. They'll be hanged.

1331
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,696
Hanged.

1332
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:00,907

You're distributing sweets.

He'll ruin your life
before getting hanged.

1336
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:11,748
No, no, please.

1337
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:14,914
l've thought of a
scene for your film.

1338
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:16,923
Come and meet us at
the police station.

1339
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,690
What's wrong, sir?
Why are you so angry?

1340
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:29,066
Those three ruined me.

1341
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:31,706
The entire family is
asking me weird questions.

1342
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:33,035
What answers should l give them?

1343
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:35,601
Bring them to the torture room.
- Yes, sir.

1344
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:42,841
ls there a shooting.
- Yes, sir.

1345
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:50,725
Actually, sir, the
director of this film..

1346
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:52,623
..was looking for an
honest police officer.

1347
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:56,027
And l said our sir would be
absolutely perfect for this role.

1348
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:59,895
Would you like to work in films?
- Of course l would.

1349
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:02,994
Do you have the passion?
- Who doesn't?

1350
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:04,602
Can you act?

1351
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:06,869
lt's the hero's role, sir.

1352
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,533
What does he have to do after all?

1353
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:10,802
Explain to him the
scene that l told you.

1354
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:12,608
ls the lighting ready, Bhaskar?

1355
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:14,705
Sir, there are three
inmates locked up here..

1356
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:16,580
..and they've been
charged with murder.

1357
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:18,550
But you know they're innocent.

1358
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:20,622
You let those three flee from here.

1359
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,788
lt's a nice scene.
- Nice, isn't it?

1360
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:29,896
But who are these
three innocent inmates?

1361
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:31,226
lt's them, sir.

1362
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:40,731
Them. Thief, blackmailer, murderer.
They're innocent.

1363
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,676
They.. they wouldn't be
innocent even in their childhood.

1364
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,144
But they are in the film.

1365
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:46,839
ln films what happens
doesn't happen actually..

1366
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:48,746
..and what doesn't
happen is what happens.

1367
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:51,786
They're culprits, but in
your view they're innocent.

1368
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:54,082
You hate them but you
also have to love them.

1369
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:56,987
This is a test of your acting.
Can you do it?

1370
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:58,719
No, he can't do it.
- No way.

1371
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:00,021
He'll fail.
- He'll fail.

Mr. Director, say cut.

1411
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:46,217
Sir, the director
fled with the artists.

1412
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:50,023
Yes, sir.
- Ran away?

1413
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:52,452
Thank you, Mr. OP.

1414
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,256
Thank you very much.
You've done us a favor.

1415
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:57,160
l'll give you back all your tapes.

1416
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:00,928
First give me back my family.
- What family?

1417
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:04,563
Yes. Your men kidnapped
them in order to save you.

1418
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,473
Who?
- Our men?

1419
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:09,137
That's him.

1420
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:11,870
Welcome.
- Marcos.

1421
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:16,546
Hi, babies.
- Hello, boys.

1422
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:17,982
Khokha.

1423
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,219
Once.. in a blue moon.

1424
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:29,158
Your family will reach home safely.

1425
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,390
You go.

1426
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:35,093
Poor babies.

1427
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:37,629
Good shot.

1428
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:40,874
Where are the diamonds?
- Diamonds.

1429
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:43,500
What's this new
problem of the diamonds?

1430
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:45,071
Which diamonds?

1431
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,341
The same diamonds you stole
from the minister's safe..

1432
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:50,213
..before we could get them.

1433
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:57,117
Sir, there's a confusion.

1434
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:58,621
We committed the theft.

1435
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:01,157
But we didn't steal any diamonds.

1436
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:05,456
The minister said that the
diamonds were in the safe.

1437
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:10,266
And these.. these scoundrels
say there were no diamonds.

1438
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:17,034
Can l say something, Mr. Marcos?
- Yes.

1439
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,612
You're their boss, speak.

1440
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:20,578
There's no driver of the bus.

1441
01:20:20,682 --> 01:20:24,243
You can all ask questions,
but let someone drive. Please.

1442
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:25,546
The diamonds were worth millions..

1443
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,451
..and we stole them
with great difficulty.

1444
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:30,150
And you got it very easily.

1445
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:34,159
So naturally you
won't tell us easily.

1446
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:35,388
That's true.

1447
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:38,933
lf the diamonds are worth
millions then no one will say it.

1448
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:42,102
Marcos, the bus is
heading towards the ravines.

1449
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:43,296
Marcos.

1450
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:45,370
Dumbo.
- Yes, boss.

1451
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:47,065
Dumbo.

1452
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:49,109
l'll tell you, quickly.
- Yes.

1453
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:50,644
Dumbo.

1454
01:20:50,745 --> 01:20:53,179
Stop it.

1455
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:01,247
Darling. Where are you?

1456
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,620
She's getting a completely
different type of a fit today.

1457
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:05,957
This is the third attack.

1458
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:08,325
And what about the attack on me?

1459
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:12,660
The criminals ran away and
you didn't even realize.

1460
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:14,394
l realized. l realized.

1461
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:16,470
l could've caught them as well.

1462
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:18,539
But the director didn't say cut.

1463
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,006
What could l have done?
Ruin the shot.

1464
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:23,339
What was the need to be a hero?

1465
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:26,676
Kajal, l say let's forget the past.

1466
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:29,311
Run. Run.

1467
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:33,319
Run. - Run.

1468
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:36,749
No. l am your daddy. Arjun's there.

1469
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:48,196
No. No.

1470
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:02,446
Father-in-law, you are here?

1471
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:04,251
She's here.

1472
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:07,620
Father-in-law, run.. Run.

1473
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:10,156
Run. Run. - Under water.

1474
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:11,322
Jump.

1475
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:18,125
Arjun.

1476
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:22,201
Arjun.

1477
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:25,600
Do something?
- Why?

1478
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:30,440
You've defamed me in the
entire police department..

1479
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:33,412
..by fixing that murderer's
alliance with my daughter.

1480
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:37,076
l say let's forget the past, Papa.

1481
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:39,312
Forget it, now.

1482
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:42,322
Arjun. - Arjun's dead.

1483
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:46,086
l never waited for the
train at the station.

1484
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:48,059
But today l am waiting for
the train lying on the tracks.

1485
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:50,324
My wife. My children.

1486
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,661
He's here.

1487
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:57,702
Our savior is here.

1488
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:03,406
Come on. Come.

1489
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:06,146
Our savior is here.

1490
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:07,575
Come.

1491
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:15,779
Excuse me, what are you doing?

1492
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:17,380
l am dying. Don't you see?

1493
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,119
l am committing suicide.

1494
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:21,492
What fate!

1495
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:24,527
Our savior is
committing suicide himself.

1496
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:26,598
Brother, you can go ahead and die.

1497
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:29,670
But first save us.
- Why you..

1498
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:32,399
Do You see?

1499
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:34,602
ls this world worth living in?

1500
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:35,835
People like these..

1501
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:37,506
Why should l stay alive?

1502
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:39,202
Everyone wants to live.

1503
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:41,874
But no one's asking the
dying person why he wants to die.

1504
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:44,151
We were going to ask after
you'd have saved us, sir.

1505
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:45,685
No, no, we'll ask first.
- Yes.

1506
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:47,778
Brother, why are you trying to die?

1507
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,720
My entire family was
killed by a bomb in Afghanistan.

1508
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:58,162
Lord.
- Parents, wife, young children.

1509
01:23:58,266 --> 01:24:00,200
They hurled a bomb and..

1510
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:04,169
l have their photograph. - No,
no. We believe you. We believe you.

1511
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:07,799
But.. we didn't kill them.
- But you didn't save them either.

1512
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:09,171
Then why do you want to stay alive?

1513
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:10,335
And what will you
do by staying alive?

1514
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:13,243
Even if you survive today tomorrow
you'll be killed by a bullet.

1515
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:14,406
Or blown up by a bomb day after.

1516
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:17,212
So it's better that
you die peacefully today.

1517
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:18,808
Right, right. - That's correct.
- lt's a nice deal.

1518
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,182
Goodbye.

1519
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:21,414
What now?

1520
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:24,515
lf it's a slow train,
we'll be minced slowly.

1521
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:28,790
And if it's a fast train..
then we'll become mincemeat.

1522
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:31,292
Come on. Come on.

1523
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,492
No, no!

1524
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:35,761
No. - Come on.

1525
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,835
Release us. - Release us.

1526
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:41,670
He wants to die.
- No!

1527
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:48,213
Which track are you running it on?

1528
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:49,647
l haven't done anything..
- Stop the..

1529
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,446
You saved me again.

1530
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:54,349
You know if l come up there,
l'll ask many questions.

1531
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:55,684
ldiots.

1532
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:58,350
What the hell are you doing?

1533
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:01,918
No.

1534
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:03,862
That's fate.

1535
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:07,262
Who wants to die and who's dying.

1536
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:12,337
No.

1537
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,499
Reverse. Reverse. Reverse.

1538
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,509
Stop the train.

1539
01:25:16,811 --> 01:25:20,406
Stop the train.

1540
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:29,818
Diamonds.

1541
01:25:29,924 --> 01:25:32,586
You doubt me?
- Who else?

1542
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:34,787
You took the money out of the safe.

1543
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:37,524
l gave the bag to boss.
Right in front of you.

1544
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:41,664
Don't raise your hand on me.

1545
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:44,997
Thieves. Do you
think l'm like you two?

1546
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,834
l am an honest man.

1547
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:49,501
l swear on you, l
don't have the diamonds.

1548
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:51,977
And l swear on my wife and children.

1549
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,804
Then where are the diamonds?

1550
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:56,850
Marcos doesn't have them.
You guys have them.

1551
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:59,647
lf l don't have them, then
where have the diamonds gone?

1552
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:03,381
Can l.. say something?
- Say it.

1553
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:06,626
Please don't get angry.
- Say it.

1554
01:26:07,061 --> 01:26:09,928
We swore, so you swear too.

1555
01:26:13,635 --> 01:26:17,537
Boss, l don't have
any relation with you..

1556
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:20,404
..but you're a nice man.

1557
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:24,307
And he's.. he's
always been close to me.

1558
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:26,913
My friend, my brother, my life.

1559
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:32,714
l swear on you two, l
don't have the diamonds.

1560
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:36,756
''You're a villain and not a hero.''

1561
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:40,794
''Arjun, you're a pain in the neck.''

1562
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:43,954
Arjun, you've made the case worse.

1563
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:45,430
What is this?

1564
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:47,865
Earlier she'd have only one
fit in a day for 10 minutes.

1565
01:26:47,969 --> 01:26:49,732
And now she gets
three-four fits a day..

1566
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:51,862
..which lasts two-three hours.

1567
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:53,938
You broke her sister's engagement.

1568
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,634
Tarnished her father's honor.

1569
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:57,005
Got your daughter
dropped out of school.

1570
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:59,511
Let's forget the past, Doctor.

1571
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:00,876
Now tell me how will
she get better?

1572
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:02,813
She won't get better now.

1573
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:04,885
lt's impossible for
her to get better now.

1574
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:06,351
No, no, Doctor.

1575
01:27:06,454 --> 01:27:08,718
At least get her back to
her earlier condition.

1576
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:10,882
Where she had one fit in a day
for 10 minutes. - Yes, Doctor.

1577
01:27:10,992 --> 01:27:12,892
We're used to it now.

1578
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:15,554
Give her shock treatment.

1579
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:19,394
Do something she
doesn't expect at all.

1580
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,434
Give her happiness. Happiness.

1581
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:23,026
You broke her sister's engagement,
didn't you?

1582
01:27:23,137 --> 01:27:24,729
Now you get her sister married.

1583
01:27:24,839 --> 01:27:28,036
But with whom?
- With any cat or dog.

1584
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:30,033
l mean with anyone.

1585
01:27:30,144 --> 01:27:33,773
Anyone. The D.l. G's son
is not too bad. Rahul.

1586
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:35,439
He also likes Sanjana.

1587
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:38,041
But will Sanjana agree?
- Papa.

1588
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:40,677
People who're betrayed in
love commit murders, suicide..

1589
01:27:40,788 --> 01:27:41,880
..so marriage is not difficult.

1590
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:43,981
We'll convince her. You
just prepare for the wedding.

1591
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,081
Arjun.

1592
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:46,893
No.

1593
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:52,093
l won't let this happen.
- And l won't let you go.

1594
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,662
Look, Yash has gone out to get food.

1595
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:54,962
Let him come back, then
we can think of something.

1596
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:57,469
l don't have time
to think. Let me go.

1597
01:27:57,572 --> 01:27:59,096
l won't let you go.
The police are there.

1598
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:00,806
They'll kill you.

1599
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:03,069
What will l do without Sanjana?

1600
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:05,145
l won't let her marry anyone
else as long as l am alive.

1601
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:06,879
Raj! Raj!

1602
01:28:08,182 --> 01:28:11,015
He's gone out to get food,
wonder when he'll return.

1603
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:13,781
And he's gone to get
shot and won't return again.

1604
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:15,913
Raj. Raj.

1605
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:23,425
No, no, don't cry.

1606
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:24,862
You're looking so nice.

1607
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:26,160
The makeup will get spoilt.

1608
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:28,799
That's why l am crying inside.

1609
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,936
Forget that deceiver.

1610
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:35,066
ln spite of whoever he was
he was still my first love.

1611
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:38,968
l see him all the time.

1612
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:43,847
Oh, God.
- What happened?

1613
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:46,916
Even now l can imagine
him walking up to me.

1614
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:48,454
Yeah, right.

1615
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:52,118
You're not imagining, it's him.

1616
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:55,993
How dare he!

1617
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:58,792
Mr. D.l.G. He's the boy.

1618
01:29:01,536 --> 01:29:02,833
You're getting married.

1619
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:04,835
How else should l punish you?

1620
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:07,772
l accept any
punishment but not this one.

1621
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:10,204
Come with me or else..
- Or else?

1622
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:11,603
Or else what will you do?

1623
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:14,204
Or else what, son? - Why
are you silent? Say it.

1624
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:15,812
What will you do?

1625
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,808
l will shoot.

1626
01:29:18,753 --> 01:29:19,947
You will shoot.

1627
01:29:20,054 --> 01:29:24,150
Shoot. - How could you
think that l'd shoot at you?

1628
01:29:27,161 --> 01:29:30,961
Raj. You can't do that.

1629
01:29:31,065 --> 01:29:34,466
You know how crazy l am.

1630
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:38,095
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1631
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:41,505
l don't keep my gun
loaded because of someone.

1632
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:44,542
Hey, boys, arrest him.

1633
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:47,503
Great.

1634
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:52,016
Papa, what happened?
- Not here, but there.

1635
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,850
But my revolver is never empty.

1636
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:59,049
lf anyone tries to move, l
will kill the groom first.

1637
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,628
And then the guests one by one.

1638
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:04,857
l think you don't
know what you are doing.

1639
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:08,493
We've done so many
things without telling anyone.

1640
01:30:08,603 --> 01:30:11,902
l didn't become a
boss by doing nothing.

1641
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:14,540
What is this bag?

1642
01:30:14,642 --> 01:30:16,576
lt was lying
upstairs so l picked it up.

1643
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:19,209
l'll have to give
daughter-in-law some gift.

1644
01:30:19,647 --> 01:30:20,978
l have another plan.

1645
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:23,016
Do you? - Yes.
- Try it.

1646
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:27,113
You've taken the D.l.
G's son hostage. - D.l. G?

1647
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:28,950
Do you know what can
be the consequences?

1648
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:31,217
You told me that they're
getting Sanjana married..

1649
01:30:31,325 --> 01:30:33,623
..to some laundryman's son.
- Yes.

1650
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:36,060
Mr. D.l. G's surname
is 'Dhobi' (Laundryman).

1651
01:30:38,299 --> 01:30:41,632
What else will you
make me do, scoundrels?

1652
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:44,895
Father, l've
switched off the lights.

1653
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:47,201
They can't see us now.
Catch them. Catch them.

1654
01:30:47,308 --> 01:30:50,573
No one will move.

1655
01:30:50,678 --> 01:30:51,736
Sorry. - Hey! Relax.

1656
01:30:51,846 --> 01:30:54,542
Situation under control.
Calm down, relax.

1657
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:56,977
She isn't Sanju, sir.

1658
01:30:57,084 --> 01:30:58,551
Daddy, where is Sanjana?

1659
01:30:58,653 --> 01:31:00,712
Where is Sanjana? -
Where have they gone?

1660
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:02,255
l think they fled.

1661
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:28,844
Petrol. Petrol.

1662
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:30,247
Not on the face. Not on the face.

1663
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:32,251
Pour it anywhere but the face.
- Not on the face.

1664
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:34,682
Not on the face.

1665
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:36,850
There's still time.

1666
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:41,019
Look. Here's the
minister's murder recording. Look.

1667
01:31:41,128 --> 01:31:44,325
Take the evidence of your
innocence and give us the diamonds.

1668
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:47,829
How many times do l tell you
we don't have the diamonds?

1669
01:31:47,935 --> 01:31:49,926
But l have an idea.

1670
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:53,732
Give us this tape so that we
can prove ourselves innocent.

1671
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:55,809
And then we can search
for the diamonds together.

1672
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:58,777
We're dealing with scoundrels.

1673
01:31:59,113 --> 01:32:01,013
They won't listen like this.

1674
01:32:01,415 --> 01:32:05,112
Hey.
- Dumbo, massage him properly.

1675
01:32:05,286 --> 01:32:06,617
Why me?

1676
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:08,655
You get a lot of ideas.

1677
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:12,624
The petrol will go to your
brain and burn all your ideas.

1678
01:32:12,727 --> 01:32:14,194
What are you staring at?

1679
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:15,353
Look, this isn't drenched.

1680
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:16,823
Pour it here.

1681
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:22,828
Here.

1682
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:24,268
We'll be fine, boss.

1683
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,306
Until we have the diamonds.

1684
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:28,274
But we don't have the diamonds.
- Yes.

1685
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:33,211
Till they think that we have
the diamonds they can't kill us.

1686
01:32:33,314 --> 01:32:36,215
Right. Right. Right.
- We won't kill you.

1687
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,147
We will only set you ablaze.

1688
01:32:38,452 --> 01:32:41,319
We'll set you ablaze
and she'll douse it.

1689
01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:45,281
We'll set you ablaze
again and she'll douse it.

1690
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:47,088
Boss, l've got a suggestion.

1691
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:49,921
Why doesn't she set us
ablaze and you douse us?

1692
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:51,826
She'll set us ablaze
again and you douse us.

1693
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:52,991
What difference will that make?

1694
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,967
You won't get burnt?
- Of course l will.

1695
01:32:56,203 --> 01:33:00,003
But it won't have that
smouldering sensation.

1696
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:02,834
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

1697
01:33:02,944 --> 01:33:05,139
ls it necessary for
everything to have a meaning?

1698
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:06,975
But what does it mean?

1699
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:08,173
Just a minute.

1700
01:33:08,282 --> 01:33:10,409
lt won't have that
smouldering sensation.

1701
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:12,185
lt won't have..

1702
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,944
Boss.
- What are you repeating for?

1703
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:15,352
Set him ablaze. l'll do it.

1704
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:21,185
Hey!
- Khokha. - What are you doing?

1705
01:33:21,295 --> 01:33:24,321
Douse this fire! - Water.

1706
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:27,060
What the hell!
- l am burning! Bring water.

1707
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:31,161
l can't turn it on. - l'll
help you. God, l am also on fire.

1708
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:33,331
Pour water.

1709
01:33:33,908 --> 01:33:36,240
Oh God! - Oh God!

1710
01:33:36,344 --> 01:33:38,175
l can't turn it on.

1711
01:33:41,015 --> 01:33:44,473
Help! Help! Douse it. Douse it.

1712
01:33:47,154 --> 01:33:48,781
Come on.

1713
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:51,380
Water. We need water.

1714
01:33:51,492 --> 01:33:53,858
Come after me.

1715
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:02,166
Scoundrels, we won't spare you.

1716
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:05,305
Hey, hey. - Hey. - Help us please!

1717
01:34:05,406 --> 01:34:09,172
Hello, the one wearing the coat.
Hey, man with the cap.

1718
01:34:10,978 --> 01:34:12,912
Our boss is a don.

1719
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:17,447
Come on.
- Keep swimming.

1720
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:18,950
Come on, swim.

1721
01:34:24,358 --> 01:34:25,950
Boss, we're safe.

1722
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:27,789
Why are you crying if we are safe?

1723
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:30,964
There's a hole in the boat.

1724
01:34:31,966 --> 01:34:33,934
Hey you, do you want to die?

1725
01:34:34,035 --> 01:34:35,525
What should l stay alive for, madam?

1726
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:38,464
Couldn't you tell us that
there's a hole in the boat?

1727
01:34:38,572 --> 01:34:40,005
We could've gone to another boat.

1728
01:34:40,107 --> 01:34:41,506
He's crazy, plug the hole.

1729
01:34:41,809 --> 01:34:43,299
Plug the hole. - Yes, l am crazy.

1730
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:45,811
My entire family was
killed in lraq, where were you?

1731
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:47,537
But what's our fault?

1732
01:34:47,848 --> 01:34:50,112
The entire world knows
whose mistake it is.

1733
01:34:50,217 --> 01:34:51,514
But you're clinging on to him.

1734
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:53,810
Did you ask him why he's
killing people? Now you all die.

1735
01:34:53,921 --> 01:34:56,788
Scoundrel, we won't die yet.

1736
01:34:56,891 --> 01:34:59,485
Why you.. - Fool, what's
that heading towards us?

1737
01:35:00,127 --> 01:35:03,494
Stop. Stop.

1738
01:35:11,272 --> 01:35:12,933
Sign on these papers.

1739
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,871
What? What should l do?

1740
01:35:15,142 --> 01:35:17,372
Sign on these papers, son.

1741
01:35:17,478 --> 01:35:19,446
You didn't have to
make papers, Father.

1742
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:22,880
Could we achieve
anything by shouting till date?

1743
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:25,349
And also, my health is not well.

1744
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:28,317
What was the need to
prepare the documents, father?

1745
01:35:29,857 --> 01:35:32,553
Anyway, after you l am
going to own everything.

1746
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,885
The house, property.. Right, Kajal?

1747
01:35:34,995 --> 01:35:38,158
These isn't my will.

1748
01:35:38,265 --> 01:35:43,498
l am talking about
your divorce with Kajal.

1749
01:35:44,305 --> 01:35:47,502
How could you say
something l can never even imagine?

1750
01:35:48,476 --> 01:35:51,843
lf you're the commissioner
then l am an inspector. Senior.

1751
01:35:52,113 --> 01:35:55,879
And nobody in this world can
make me sign against my will.

1752
01:35:55,983 --> 01:35:57,177
Sign it!

1753
01:36:00,387 --> 01:36:01,945
Sign it!

1754
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:06,593
You don't keep a loaded gun..

1755
01:36:07,628 --> 01:36:09,619
..and consider
yourself to be a big hunter.

1756
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:13,093
Kajal. - You can't even hit
one bird with two stones..

1757
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,191
..and you try to hit
two birds with one stone.

1758
01:36:15,302 --> 01:36:18,635
Grandpa. Mummy is getting a
new kind of fit. - Yes, dear.

1759
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:20,634
Sign it.
- Kajal, Kajal.

1760
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:22,067
What Kajal?

1761
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:24,337
That criminal
abducted Kajal's sister..

1762
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:26,470
..and you just watched.
- l.. l.. l..

1763
01:36:27,148 --> 01:36:29,207
Sign it.
- l'll do it.. l'll do it.

1764
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,013
Mistake. lt's burnt my mistake.

1765
01:36:35,122 --> 01:36:37,215
l am dead.
- Arjun!

1766
01:36:56,644 --> 01:37:00,444
Kamini. Kamini. l say
let's forget the past.

1767
01:37:01,448 --> 01:37:02,642
Past. Past.

1768
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:05,244
You like covering up
the past, don't you?

1769
01:37:05,352 --> 01:37:06,979
No. No.
- Here.

1770
01:37:07,087 --> 01:37:09,078
Here.

1771
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:18,190
Grandpa, please save my father.
- Let him die.

1772
01:37:18,299 --> 01:37:20,563
He's a pain in the neck.
- Grandpa.

1773
01:37:41,655 --> 01:37:42,952
Yash.

1774
01:37:43,057 --> 01:37:45,218
These innocent people
got involved unnecessarily.

1775
01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:48,989
She's innocent. lsn't
he innocent as well?

1776
01:37:49,096 --> 01:37:50,620
He hasn't harmed anyone.

1777
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:52,494
He just took us home once..

1778
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:54,465
..and then lost
his house and family.

1779
01:37:54,568 --> 01:37:58,197
Just think about his
family's condition without him.

1780
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:01,364
Raj, let's make a promise.

1781
01:38:02,476 --> 01:38:04,740
lf he's killed in an encounter..

1782
01:38:05,045 --> 01:38:08,981
..then we'll raise his children.
- Done.

1783
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:12,012
And what about the wife?
- She'll get married again.

1784
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:15,179
She's smart.
- Quiet, you scoundrels.

1785
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:16,551
Quiet.
- What happened, Uncle?

1786
01:38:16,657 --> 01:38:17,715
Did you hear?

1787
01:38:18,025 --> 01:38:21,984
They're saying that
they'll kill me in an encounter..

1788
01:38:22,096 --> 01:38:24,428
..and get my wife remarried.

1789
01:38:24,531 --> 01:38:28,058
Rascals. l curse you.

1790
01:38:28,168 --> 01:38:30,329
You think l'll die and
you two will survive?

1791
01:38:30,437 --> 01:38:31,734
ls it?

1792
01:38:35,075 --> 01:38:38,044
Who was it? - Billa. Murderer.
- Billa.

1793
01:38:38,145 --> 01:38:40,170
They're still after us.

1794
01:38:41,248 --> 01:38:43,011
There's someone upstairs. Come on.

1795
01:38:43,117 --> 01:38:44,209
What will we do?
- What are we going to do?

1796
01:38:44,318 --> 01:38:46,252
Wait, let me think.

1797
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:50,520
Hey, you..

1798
01:38:59,099 --> 01:39:02,125
Who's there?
- Should l throw a hand grenade?

1799
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:06,467
No, no. We've laid mines. - Mines.

1800
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:09,040
Whoever steps on it
will get blown up.

1801
01:39:09,143 --> 01:39:10,542
Sofia, careful.

1802
01:39:10,644 --> 01:39:14,307
Oh, God. This scud
missile is really amazing.

1803
01:39:14,415 --> 01:39:16,406
Should l blow up
that tank and test it?

1804
01:39:16,517 --> 01:39:17,643
No, why are you wasting it?

1805
01:39:17,751 --> 01:39:21,209
We've sold one diamond and
bought these arms to kill Marcos.

1806
01:39:21,322 --> 01:39:22,619
You did the right thing.

1807
01:39:22,723 --> 01:39:24,816
Otherwise Marcos
wouldn't have spared us.

1808
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:26,649
He's a dangerous man.

1809
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:28,487
What dangerous?

1810
01:39:28,595 --> 01:39:30,187
He's a big balloon.

1811
01:39:31,265 --> 01:39:34,564
He lays us on the tracks and
the train comes after him.

1812
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:37,660
He pours petrol on us
and gets burnt himself.

1813
01:39:37,771 --> 01:39:41,605
That's because of his four foolish
accomplices. - We are insulted.

1814
01:39:42,109 --> 01:39:45,272
And the fifth one?
- She's a queen.

1815
01:39:45,379 --> 01:39:48,576
l've seen love in her eyes for me.
- Yes.

1816
01:39:48,682 --> 01:39:52,083
On the yacht, she was
making gestures at me secretly.

1817
01:39:52,186 --> 01:39:54,814
Then she's sister-in-law.
- No.

1818
01:39:55,122 --> 01:39:56,646
Come on, pick up the weapons.

1819
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:58,850
Be careful with the bazooka.

1820
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:02,788
And listen don't forget
that we've laid the mines.

1821
01:40:17,244 --> 01:40:19,610
Boss, they left.

1822
01:40:19,713 --> 01:40:21,476
But how will we get out?

1823
01:40:23,317 --> 01:40:24,545
Marcos.

1824
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:27,612
Run.

1825
01:40:27,721 --> 01:40:30,884
Follow them, come on. Move it.

1826
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:35,795
Wow, lovely.

1827
01:40:42,936 --> 01:40:44,904
Let's go inside. lnside.

1828
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,918
All arrangements done.
- Yes, sir.

1829
01:41:05,793 --> 01:41:09,229
Why is there such
a big reward on me?

1830
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:12,191
Because you're the boss.
- Boss.

1831
01:41:13,467 --> 01:41:15,230
This.. is a police station, Raj.

1832
01:41:15,335 --> 01:41:17,428
This.. is a police
station, come on.

1833
01:41:23,444 --> 01:41:27,642
Greetings. - Wow! What a
lucky police station this is?

1834
01:41:27,848 --> 01:41:29,247
The opening's tomorrow..

1835
01:41:29,349 --> 01:41:30,907
..and the criminals
have arrived today.

1836
01:41:31,218 --> 01:41:33,311
Where are the rest?
- Right here.

1837
01:41:34,955 --> 01:41:36,252
They ran away.

1838
01:41:36,356 --> 01:41:38,415
But l didn't run. But l didn't run.

1839
01:41:38,525 --> 01:41:39,583
You're tired as well.

1840
01:41:39,693 --> 01:41:42,218
Yes, l am tired. But l didn't run.

1841
01:41:42,329 --> 01:41:44,456
l didn't run. And
why should l run, sir?

1842
01:41:44,565 --> 01:41:46,465
When l haven't done
anything then why should l run?

1843
01:41:46,567 --> 01:41:47,659
l am innocent, sir.

1844
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:48,962
We'll find out how
innocent you are..

1845
01:41:49,269 --> 01:41:51,260
..as soon as we
reach the headquarters.

1846
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:52,531
How is that, sir?

1847
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:55,733
We've got a machine, a lie detector.

1848
01:41:55,843 --> 01:41:58,778
And it can detect
lies and the truth.

1849
01:41:59,379 --> 01:42:01,313
You have such a machine?
- Yes.

1850
01:42:01,415 --> 01:42:03,349
Sir, why didn't
you say that earlier?

1851
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:05,441
Sir, l kept running and running.

1852
01:42:05,552 --> 01:42:08,578
Sir, take me to that
machine right now. Come, sir.

1853
01:42:08,722 --> 01:42:09,882
This machine isn't working.

1854
01:42:10,524 --> 01:42:12,287
lt's stating wrong as
right and right as wrong.

1855
01:42:12,392 --> 01:42:13,757
Repair it quickly.

1856
01:42:13,861 --> 01:42:16,591
Or else some honest man will
get beaten up by our boss.

1857
01:42:16,697 --> 01:42:17,959
Sir.

1858
01:42:20,767 --> 01:42:22,291
So, this is the machine.

1859
01:42:22,402 --> 01:42:23,562
Sit down.

1860
01:42:35,682 --> 01:42:37,707
Sir, this.. - No
disturbance during interrogation.

1861
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:39,877
But, sir, this..
- Shut up.

1862
01:42:40,053 --> 01:42:42,613
Or else l'll make you sit here.
- Sit down, sit down.

1863
01:42:42,723 --> 01:42:44,281
Sir is getting disturbed. Sit down.

1864
01:42:53,567 --> 01:42:54,829
Hello, hello.

1865
01:42:55,068 --> 01:42:57,866
What is your name?
- Zandu Lal.

1866
01:42:57,971 --> 01:43:00,371
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

1867
01:43:01,742 --> 01:43:02,868
Who is the boss?

1868
01:43:02,976 --> 01:43:05,706
Boss, l..
- Right, right, right.

1869
01:43:05,946 --> 01:43:08,540
Good. And how long have
you been running this gang?

1870
01:43:08,649 --> 01:43:13,018
Gang? l run a bank.

1871
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:15,584
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

1872
01:43:17,491 --> 01:43:20,654
Are you a man or a woman?

1873
01:43:20,761 --> 01:43:21,989
l..

1874
01:43:25,699 --> 01:43:28,896
l am a woman.
- Right. Right. Right.

1875
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:32,600
l had my doubt.

1876
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:35,539
But your machine
is working properly.

1877
01:43:35,776 --> 01:43:39,576
You're being tested
and not the machine.

1878
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:50,420
How many women are you having an
affair with other than your wife?

1879
01:43:51,391 --> 01:43:53,018
Other than my wife..

1880
01:43:54,094 --> 01:43:58,360
Other than my wife l have
an affair with all women.

1881
01:43:58,465 --> 01:44:00,660
Right. Right. Right.

1882
01:44:04,972 --> 01:44:07,770
That means sorrow in the
house and merriment outside.

1883
01:44:08,609 --> 01:44:09,803
What is this, sir?

1884
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:11,400
Sugarcane.

1885
01:44:11,511 --> 01:44:13,376
Silent assassin.
- Silent assassin.

1886
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,948
lt leaves no mark behind
but causes a lot of pain.

1887
01:44:19,686 --> 01:44:21,017
lf you..

1888
01:44:25,092 --> 01:44:27,890
Hello. Hello, Kajal darling.

1889
01:44:28,629 --> 01:44:29,789
What?

1890
01:44:30,063 --> 01:44:31,530
Tuktuk is missing.

1891
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:33,126
lt's been two hours.

1892
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:35,127
She's nowhere to be found.

1893
01:44:35,636 --> 01:44:36,830
Kajal..

1894
01:44:37,137 --> 01:44:39,628
Kajal, don't worry.

1895
01:44:44,678 --> 01:44:45,736
Why are you laughing?

1896
01:44:45,846 --> 01:44:53,116
An underworld boss.. who
murdered the minister..

1897
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:56,082
..robbed a bank, you
think you can beat him up..

1898
01:44:56,456 --> 01:44:58,424
..on grounds of right and wrong.

1899
01:44:58,525 --> 01:45:01,653
And your children
can roam around freely.

1900
01:45:01,762 --> 01:45:03,059
What do you mean?

1901
01:45:03,497 --> 01:45:09,402
l mean.. my children
have kidnapped your child.

1902
01:45:09,503 --> 01:45:12,131
Right.
- Look, boss.

1903
01:45:12,673 --> 01:45:16,973
l say let's forget the past.
- l see.

1904
01:45:17,077 --> 01:45:19,102
l just say that.

1905
01:45:19,746 --> 01:45:21,145
Don't harm my child, please.

1906
01:45:21,448 --> 01:45:23,473
Your child will be absolutely safe.

1907
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:26,484
You've released me and
also given me a car.

1908
01:45:26,586 --> 01:45:28,451
l will call my gang members..

1909
01:45:28,555 --> 01:45:30,648
..and inform them to
take your child back home.

1910
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:34,825
This boss is just..
- Why did you disconnect it.

1911
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:36,929
He'll be safe in the police station.

1912
01:45:38,131 --> 01:45:40,497
l told them.
- But, sir, you didn't say anything.

1913
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:43,433
l am the boss, l talk in codes.

1914
01:45:43,537 --> 01:45:47,598
''l love my heart..''

1915
01:45:47,708 --> 01:45:48,936
Hello, Kajal.

1916
01:45:49,042 --> 01:45:50,600
Don't worry, Kajal.

1917
01:45:50,711 --> 01:45:52,611
Tuktuk will come home soon.

1918
01:45:52,946 --> 01:45:54,846
What? She's at home.

1919
01:45:55,115 --> 01:45:58,107
She's at home. - Really?
- Yes, Naidu.

1920
01:45:58,218 --> 01:46:00,152
Kaja, l..

1921
01:46:01,955 --> 01:46:03,217
Zandu Lal.

1922
01:46:03,523 --> 01:46:04,888
You fooled me?

1923
01:46:08,662 --> 01:46:09,822
Move aside.

1924
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:21,734
Papa.

1925
01:46:21,842 --> 01:46:23,639
Papa, are you fine?

1926
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:25,602
Why are you yelling at me?

1927
01:46:25,712 --> 01:46:26,906
You should look where you're going.

1928
01:46:27,013 --> 01:46:28,207
You should look where
you were going, sir.

1929
01:46:28,515 --> 01:46:29,777
lt's your mistake. Yes, sir.

1930
01:46:29,883 --> 01:46:32,875
Let's forget the past,
call the ambulance, Naidu.

1931
01:46:32,986 --> 01:46:34,180
Ambulance.

1932
01:46:42,129 --> 01:46:45,064
Raj. Raj. Raj.

1933
01:46:47,734 --> 01:46:49,031
Sanjana.

1934
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:54,968
Boss.

1935
01:46:56,309 --> 01:46:57,936
Tell me something.

1936
01:46:58,678 --> 01:47:01,977
ls your incoming
free in your mobile?

1937
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:03,879
Yes.
- lt is, isn't it?

1938
01:47:03,984 --> 01:47:05,952
Then.. then why did
you disconnect my call?

1939
01:47:06,553 --> 01:47:07,884
l would've been
charged for the call.

1940
01:47:07,988 --> 01:47:10,548
Why did you disconnect my call?
- Uncle, don't hit Raj..

1941
01:47:10,791 --> 01:47:12,884
Quiet. l will slap you. Quiet.

1942
01:47:13,293 --> 01:47:14,658
Scoundrels.

1943
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:16,752
Boss.
- You handed the diamond to me..

1944
01:47:16,863 --> 01:47:18,194
Don't hit us, boss.

1945
01:47:18,598 --> 01:47:21,726
You didn't think
what would happen to me.

1946
01:47:32,312 --> 01:47:35,873
What is this?
- lt's a diamond. Diamond.

1947
01:47:35,982 --> 01:47:37,973
l can see that, fool.

1948
01:47:38,084 --> 01:47:39,574
But what are you doing with it?

1949
01:47:39,686 --> 01:47:41,153
l had them.

1950
01:47:41,254 --> 01:47:43,722
Didn't l tell you the other day?

1951
01:47:43,824 --> 01:47:46,258
That's how we
brought the fake weapons.

1952
01:47:46,359 --> 01:47:48,793
And what about when you swore on us?

1953
01:47:48,895 --> 01:47:50,886
Are you two dead?

1954
01:47:51,064 --> 01:47:54,192
Boss, please release me. l want
to say something as well, please.

1955
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:55,962
Release him.

1956
01:47:56,069 --> 01:47:57,696
Release me, please.

1957
01:47:59,673 --> 01:48:02,335
Hey!
- Boss, the sugarcane. - No.

1958
01:48:02,642 --> 01:48:03,973
Boss, no.
- Boss, me too.

1959
01:48:04,077 --> 01:48:05,135
How many pieces should
l break one sugarcane into?

1960
01:48:05,245 --> 01:48:06,303
Daughter-in-law, no..

1961
01:48:06,613 --> 01:48:07,671
Daughter-in-law, you can't hit me.

1962
01:48:07,781 --> 01:48:09,646
l am your brother-in-law.
- You're her brother-in-law.

1963
01:48:09,749 --> 01:48:10,841
You're her brother-in-law.

1964
01:48:10,951 --> 01:48:14,045
What if she had suffered burns
the other day? - Answer him.

1965
01:48:14,287 --> 01:48:15,652
We've got the diamonds.

1966
01:48:15,755 --> 01:48:16,915
We could've gotten
plastic surgery done.

1967
01:48:17,023 --> 01:48:18,251
What if your father-in-law
had lost his arms and legs..

1968
01:48:18,358 --> 01:48:19,689
..because of the train?

1969
01:48:19,793 --> 01:48:21,192
Boss, we have the diamonds.

1970
01:48:21,294 --> 01:48:23,159
We could've gotten new ones.

1971
01:48:24,397 --> 01:48:25,796
How many more diamonds do you have?

1972
01:48:25,899 --> 01:48:28,265
That's all that l have.
- He's lying.

1973
01:48:28,368 --> 01:48:30,268
He's a liar.
- Boss. - Yes.

1974
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:32,201
Let's take his
clothes off and search him.

1975
01:48:32,305 --> 01:48:33,738
No, no, no, not in
front of daughter-in-law.

1976
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,171
Daughter-in-law, turn around.

1977
01:48:35,275 --> 01:48:36,367
Turn around.

1978
01:48:36,676 --> 01:48:39,110
Let's take his clothes off.
- Boss. Boss.

1979
01:48:39,212 --> 01:48:41,612
l will strip him. - No, boss.

1980
01:48:41,715 --> 01:48:46,914
Raj, what are you doing!
Raj, leave me.

1981
01:48:52,325 --> 01:48:55,692
With these diamonds l can
open up hundreds of banks.

1982
01:48:55,795 --> 01:48:59,287
l can bribe the judge,
police and the minister.

1983
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:01,094
A few diamonds will be enough.

1984
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:03,396
Only one diamond
will be enough, Boss.

1985
01:49:04,838 --> 01:49:06,931
l've done all the calculations.

1986
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:09,368
Come here, let me
explain to you. Come here.

1987
01:49:09,676 --> 01:49:13,703
Boss, it's not more valuable than
my love and your wife and children.

1988
01:49:13,813 --> 01:49:15,144
You want to go back to your
village, don't you? - Yes.

1989
01:49:15,248 --> 01:49:16,977
Fine, then let's
give them to Marcos..

1990
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:18,141
..and take the
evidence of our innocence.

1991
01:49:18,251 --> 01:49:19,309
Of course, of course.

1992
01:49:19,419 --> 01:49:21,979
lt's better to bribe everyone, boss.

1993
01:49:22,088 --> 01:49:23,646
Otherwise he'll take the diamonds..

1994
01:49:23,757 --> 01:49:25,782
..kill everyone and won't
even handover the evidence.

1995
01:49:25,892 --> 01:49:26,984
Be quiet.
- Shut up.

1996
01:49:27,093 --> 01:49:31,029
Keep your mouth shut. - Listen to
me, boss. Boss. Boss. Listen to me.

1997
01:49:31,197 --> 01:49:32,664
Be quiet.
- Be quiet.

1998
01:49:35,869 --> 01:49:37,302
Yash was right.

1999
01:49:37,404 --> 01:49:39,201
We can't trust Marcos.

2000
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:40,737
Then what should we do?

2001
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:42,307
We can't approach the police.

2002
01:49:42,409 --> 01:49:44,036
They'll shoot us at sight.

2003
01:49:44,144 --> 01:49:45,907
We can get the police's help.

2004
01:49:46,446 --> 01:49:47,743
There's one way.

2005
01:49:47,847 --> 01:49:48,973
Do you want anything else, dear?

2006
01:49:49,082 --> 01:49:51,175
Mother never buys me balloons.

2007
01:49:51,284 --> 01:49:53,013
Uncle will buy it for you.

2008
01:49:53,186 --> 01:49:54,380
Why uncle?

2009
01:49:54,487 --> 01:49:55,749
Buy a little extra.

2010
01:49:55,855 --> 01:49:58,790
As a child, you
would argue with daddy..

2011
01:49:58,892 --> 01:50:01,019
..to fulfil every
small wish of mine.

2012
01:50:01,127 --> 01:50:03,322
And today when it's
the question of my life..

2013
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:05,261
..can't you convince daddy?

2014
01:50:05,365 --> 01:50:09,267
Here's your candy.
- And here's your balloon.

2015
01:50:09,369 --> 01:50:10,802
lf we can impress the child..

2016
01:50:10,904 --> 01:50:12,895
..the mother will be
automatically impressed.

2017
01:50:16,509 --> 01:50:19,103
Sister Sanjana. Sister Sanjana.

2018
01:50:19,512 --> 01:50:21,207
Tuktuk.

2019
01:50:21,748 --> 01:50:25,479
Save me! Save me, sister!

2020
01:50:25,785 --> 01:50:28,379
What did you do? - You
asked me to buy extra balloons.

2021
01:50:28,488 --> 01:50:30,183
But so many that
the child flew away!

2022
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:32,451
Save her.
- Save me.

2023
01:50:32,759 --> 01:50:34,226
God.

2024
01:50:34,327 --> 01:50:36,989
Someone save me.

2025
01:50:41,968 --> 01:50:44,232
Mummy. Mummy, save.

2026
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:50,034
Give me.. - Mummy.

2027
01:50:50,143 --> 01:50:52,134
You're trying to kill my child.

2028
01:50:52,245 --> 01:50:54,975
l am saving her, l'm not
killing her. - Okay. - Blue.

2029
01:50:55,382 --> 01:50:57,247
Yellow.

2030
01:50:58,451 --> 01:51:00,419
Red. Red.

2031
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:07,216
Your aim is good.
- l just realized that.

2032
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:11,520
Mummy. Mummy.

2033
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:14,291
Thank God.

2034
01:51:14,401 --> 01:51:16,096
You know how scared mother was.

2035
01:51:16,202 --> 01:51:17,863
Who gave you the balloons?

2036
01:51:22,976 --> 01:51:24,466
She was playing with us?

2037
01:51:24,577 --> 01:51:26,135
Who gave you the balloons?

2038
01:51:26,246 --> 01:51:28,180
Tell me, dear, who
gave you the balloons?

2039
01:51:28,281 --> 01:51:30,249
l think the child can't speak
because of the shock. - Yes.

2040
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:33,285
l think it's not right
to question her right now.

2041
01:51:33,453 --> 01:51:34,784
Thank you, Raj.

2042
01:51:34,888 --> 01:51:36,287
lf it hadn't been for you..

2043
01:51:36,389 --> 01:51:40,120
..then l wonder where my
child would've been flying today.

2044
01:51:40,226 --> 01:51:44,026
You two saved my child that's
why l'm ready to forget the past.

2045
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:46,496
But who knocked daddy down?

2046
01:51:46,599 --> 01:51:47,930
Some enemy.

2047
01:51:48,034 --> 01:51:49,934
We haven't found
that car driver yet.

2048
01:51:50,036 --> 01:51:52,266
But your brother-in-law and the
police are still searching for them.

2049
01:51:52,372 --> 01:51:54,806
You know, Sanju,
they tried to kill him..

2050
01:51:54,908 --> 01:51:56,375
lsn't it enough that he survived?

2051
01:51:56,476 --> 01:51:59,536
He's more shocked
than hurt, that's all.

2052
01:51:59,846 --> 01:52:01,541
Daddy wants to say something.

2053
01:52:03,883 --> 01:52:05,145
But he can't speak.

2054
01:52:05,351 --> 01:52:06,841
Then let him write it.

2055
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:09,880
He isn't dying that we'll
make him write his will.

2056
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:13,051
Sister, why is he
pointing towards brother-in-law?

2057
01:52:13,159 --> 01:52:15,491
He's asking me to help these two.

2058
01:52:15,595 --> 01:52:18,120
Oh, he'll help us.
- Father-in-law..

2059
01:52:18,231 --> 01:52:22,065
Sister, give him a strong
dose of 500 cc and let him rest.

2060
01:52:22,168 --> 01:52:24,033
Yes, sir.
- Sanjana. - Okay.

2061
01:52:24,137 --> 01:52:26,002
Take papa to his room
after the injection.

2062
01:52:26,573 --> 01:52:28,268
Daddy. Daddy, please cooperate.
- Daddy, relax.

2063
01:52:28,374 --> 01:52:30,308
Daddy, take the injection.

2064
01:52:32,145 --> 01:52:33,476
Now here's my plan.

2065
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:37,106
There's a transmitter in this pen.

2066
01:52:38,017 --> 01:52:41,316
This time l will kill
three birds with one stone.

2067
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:43,082
You won't have to give the diamonds.

2068
01:52:43,189 --> 01:52:45,623
l will get the evidence of
your innocence from Marcos..

2069
01:52:45,925 --> 01:52:48,120
..and then arrest him

2070
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:55,629
Mike testing. One, two,
three. lnspector, are you ready?

2071
01:52:56,035 --> 01:52:58,367
Yes. Yes. Don't worry.
Don't worry, boys.

2072
01:52:58,471 --> 01:53:00,939
'Operation three birds' is ready.

2073
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:06,244
Calm down. Calm down.

2074
01:53:06,646 --> 01:53:08,614
Welcome, babies.

2075
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:15,385
Just you two?

2076
01:53:15,555 --> 01:53:17,887
Where is the third one?
The tall one?

2077
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:23,095
l am asking because he's dangerous.
Something could be fishy.

2078
01:53:23,196 --> 01:53:26,165
No, no, this isn't any plan.
- Diamonds.

2079
01:53:26,499 --> 01:53:28,433
Evidence.

2080
01:53:28,535 --> 01:53:30,059
Yes, the evidence.

2081
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:33,503
We need evidence to prove
that you murdered the minister.

2082
01:53:33,606 --> 01:53:35,096
Come on, let's go. Come on.

2083
01:53:35,208 --> 01:53:36,470
Everybody down.

2084
01:53:37,243 --> 01:53:39,302
Sir, sir. The dog's going that way.

2085
01:53:39,412 --> 01:53:40,936
Am l the officer or is the dog?

2086
01:53:41,047 --> 01:53:43,242
Sir, you are.
- Then follow me.

2087
01:53:47,253 --> 01:53:48,618
That's fine.

2088
01:53:51,457 --> 01:53:54,426
Let's go. Thank you very much.

2089
01:53:54,594 --> 01:53:55,993
Wait.

2090
01:53:56,462 --> 01:53:57,690
Where are the rest of the diamonds?

2091
01:53:58,164 --> 01:53:59,495
Rest of them? What?

2092
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:01,066
Diamonds.

2093
01:54:01,434 --> 01:54:03,493
That's all.
- They're not.

2094
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:06,297
This is just half.
- Cut, cut.

2095
01:54:07,407 --> 01:54:08,965
We're trapped.

2096
01:54:09,075 --> 01:54:11,100
We're trapped.

2097
01:54:11,578 --> 01:54:14,069
Don't worry, don't worry, l
am coming. We're almost there.

2098
01:54:17,483 --> 01:54:18,950
Hello, hello.

2099
01:54:19,052 --> 01:54:21,145
There's a microphone.

2100
01:54:23,089 --> 01:54:24,556
Sir, there's no one here, sir.

2101
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:31,196
Naidu, look they're so stupid.

2102
01:54:31,297 --> 01:54:32,457
They went inside the wrong building.

2103
01:54:32,565 --> 01:54:34,123
We're in the wrong building, sir.

2104
01:54:34,234 --> 01:54:36,361
We should've followed
the dog and not you.

2105
01:54:36,569 --> 01:54:38,969
O God! Where have
you brought us, Sanju?

2106
01:54:39,072 --> 01:54:40,232
ls this a place to meet someone?

2107
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:42,274
l should've never listened to..

2108
01:54:43,343 --> 01:54:45,072
Daughter-in-law, you?
- To hell with daughter-in-law.

2109
01:54:45,178 --> 01:54:46,372
lt's all your fault.

2110
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:48,606
Raj and uncle haven't
returned after meeting Marcos yet.

2111
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:52,344
Arjun hasn't returned either.
- l see, Arjun went along as well.

2112
01:54:52,452 --> 01:54:54,113
lf it didn't concern you, Sanju..

2113
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:55,687
..then l wouldn't have sent
him on this dangerous mission.

2114
01:54:55,788 --> 01:54:59,053
Don't worry, they'll be
absolutely fine, okay.

2115
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:00,552
Why haven't they called yet?

2116
01:55:04,497 --> 01:55:07,989
Hello.
- You rascal, scoundrel, cheater.

2117
01:55:08,101 --> 01:55:11,400
lt's them.
- Speaker. Speaker.

2118
01:55:12,438 --> 01:55:14,497
You're bound to get
stuck if you take only half.

2119
01:55:14,607 --> 01:55:16,507
Couldn't you tell us
that we're taking only half?

2120
01:55:16,609 --> 01:55:18,236
You gagged my mouth.

2121
01:55:18,344 --> 01:55:20,676
You didn't let me speak.
- Tell me something..

2122
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:22,748
..where did you hide
the rest of the diamonds?

2123
01:55:23,049 --> 01:55:25,347
Daughter-in-law and
sister are right here.

2124
01:55:25,451 --> 01:55:26,577
Let it stay hidden.

2125
01:55:26,686 --> 01:55:28,381
Just do as l say.

2126
01:55:28,488 --> 01:55:32,219
Bring the diamonds here or
else they won't spare me and boss.

2127
01:55:33,393 --> 01:55:35,384
Did they kill Arjun?

2128
01:55:35,495 --> 01:55:37,292
He got us into this.

2129
01:55:37,397 --> 01:55:39,422
He sent us ahead and he went
inside the other building.

2130
01:55:39,532 --> 01:55:41,193
He hasn't got here.

2131
01:55:41,301 --> 01:55:44,202
He must be hiding
somewhere out of shame.

2132
01:55:44,304 --> 01:55:45,794
The coward.

2133
01:55:48,141 --> 01:55:49,301
Sister!
- What?

2134
01:55:49,409 --> 01:55:50,535
Sister!
- What happened?

2135
01:55:50,643 --> 01:55:53,077
Please stay fine.
- l am fine.

2136
01:55:53,379 --> 01:55:54,607
Stay fine. Stay fine.

2137
01:55:55,248 --> 01:55:56,772
Hello.
- Yes, go ahead.

2138
01:55:57,083 --> 01:55:58,277
Hello, Yash.

2139
01:55:58,384 --> 01:56:00,352
What's wrong with your voice, boss?

2140
01:56:00,453 --> 01:56:05,550
Not boss, consider that
it's your father speaking.

2141
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:07,558
l am in trouble, son.

2142
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:10,356
These people
thrashed your father badly.

2143
01:56:12,365 --> 01:56:15,129
For the first time
someone called me son.

2144
01:56:16,369 --> 01:56:18,667
ls it okay if l call you papa?

2145
01:56:18,771 --> 01:56:21,399
Do you speak from your heart, son?
- No, Papa.

2146
01:56:21,507 --> 01:56:24,271
l am speaking from my
mouth but l really mean it.

2147
01:56:24,477 --> 01:56:27,742
l suggest you bring
the diamonds quickly.

2148
01:56:28,348 --> 01:56:30,680
Your papa has to go back
to his village, isn't it?

2149
01:56:30,783 --> 01:56:32,648
Come on.
- l am coming right away, Papa.

2150
01:56:32,752 --> 01:56:34,276
Right away.

2151
01:57:19,298 --> 01:57:20,458
Papa.

2152
01:57:24,203 --> 01:57:26,763
ldiot! What are you doing?

2153
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:29,401
What did l do?
- What did you do?

2154
01:57:29,509 --> 01:57:30,703
You dropped so many
things on my head..

2155
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:32,368
..and now you're
asking what you did.

2156
01:57:32,478 --> 01:57:34,241
You banged up my head. - Shut up!

2157
01:57:35,181 --> 01:57:38,275
lt's a chain and not a thread.
lt's a chain.

2158
01:57:38,651 --> 01:57:40,585
Tell me where the key is.

2159
01:57:40,686 --> 01:57:43,211
With Sofia. - What? - With Sofia.

2160
01:57:43,322 --> 01:57:44,619
Sofia?

2161
01:57:48,494 --> 01:57:51,156
Hey! Hey! - What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

2162
01:57:51,264 --> 01:57:53,425
Cutting the chain! lt
can be cut with the axe.

2163
01:57:55,601 --> 01:57:56,932
Are you doing it for
the first time? - Yes.

2164
01:57:57,236 --> 01:57:59,727
Son, get some practice first.

2165
01:58:05,678 --> 01:58:07,475
Hit it, hit it.

2166
01:58:12,285 --> 01:58:13,445
Let it be, son.

2167
01:58:13,553 --> 01:58:15,578
lt's better to remain tied up.

2168
01:58:15,855 --> 01:58:18,323
Your father won't
look nice without hands.

2169
01:58:18,424 --> 01:58:20,949
Papa, let me practice some more.

2170
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:24,354
No, son.

2171
01:58:38,611 --> 01:58:39,839
Marcos!

2172
01:58:41,681 --> 01:58:43,649

Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

2174
01:58:46,886 --> 01:58:48,251

2175
01:58:48,354 --> 01:58:49,878
l'll just get the key and come back.

2176
01:58:49,989 --> 01:58:52,719
And papa? - He's
going to get the key.

2177
01:58:55,761 --> 01:58:57,353
Something's wrong.

2178
01:59:02,335 --> 01:59:03,734
Where is Sofia?

2179
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,966
Where is Sofia?

2180
01:59:08,407 --> 01:59:11,433
Boss, that tall guy took Sofia.

2181
01:59:11,611 --> 01:59:12,737
What?
- He took her away?

2182
01:59:12,845 --> 01:59:14,870
But he came to free his papa.

2183
01:59:14,981 --> 01:59:16,744
lnstead he took the girl away.

2184
01:59:16,849 --> 01:59:20,307
See, he deceived us as
well and notjust you.

2185
01:59:23,589 --> 01:59:25,819
Press it. What are
you staring at me for?

2186
01:59:25,925 --> 01:59:28,689
Keep pressing it till they
don't give us the address.

2187

Keep pressing it.

2188

Hello. - Do you want
the girl or the diamonds?

2189

Hey. l thought you came here to
return the rest of the diamonds..

2190
01:59:41,374 --> 01:59:42,898
..and free your friends.

2191
01:59:43,009 --> 01:59:45,637
l didn't come there
to give the diamonds..

2192
01:59:45,745 --> 01:59:47,770
..but to take the
rest of the diamonds.

2193
01:59:48,347 --> 01:59:50,008
That's why l abducted your girl.

2194
01:59:50,316 --> 01:59:52,341
Where is Sophie?
- What did you say?

2195
01:59:52,885 --> 01:59:55,877
lt won't make any difference
to you even if l kill Sophia.

2196
01:59:55,988 --> 01:59:57,717
You just need the diamonds.

2197
01:59:57,823 --> 01:59:59,347
What are you saying..
- Marcos, you rascal.

2198
01:59:59,458 --> 02:00:00,550
You want to kill me.
- Cool down.

2199
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:01,786
Cool down, baby.
- l will kill you.

2200
02:00:01,894 --> 02:00:04,692
Cool down, baby.
- Take care of her.

2201
02:00:06,632 --> 02:00:07,860
Did you hear?

2202
02:00:09,001 --> 02:00:11,663
Come with my men and the
diamonds to the 'Dhaba' (lnn).

2203
02:00:11,771 --> 02:00:15,002
The deal will be made there.
lf you try to act smart..

2204
02:00:16,042 --> 02:00:18,738
..then l'll grind your
diamonds into powder.

2205
02:00:18,844 --> 02:00:20,744
And you can make bread from it.

2206
02:00:20,846 --> 02:00:22,006
Without the vegetables.

2207
02:00:28,821 --> 02:00:30,015
Yes, boss.

2208
02:00:30,389 --> 02:00:31,879
Gather everyone.

2209
02:00:31,991 --> 02:00:34,892
But, boss, it can be dangerous..

2210
02:00:34,994 --> 02:00:37,792
..to go to the place
where he has called us.

2211
02:00:37,897 --> 02:00:39,421

2212
02:00:39,799 --> 02:00:42,632

'Baisaki' festival at the 'Dhaba'..

We'll go there dressed
as a Sardar as well..

2215
02:00:48,474 --> 02:00:49,964
..so that they don't recognize us.

2216
02:00:50,076 --> 02:00:51,407
Sardar?

2217

How can l, sister and
Sophie dress like a Sardar?

Father, give me one last chance.

This time l will kill
five birds with one stone.

2225

Marcos has four accomplices.

2226

2263
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:03,660
''The Jatt's look so majestic.''

2264
02:05:03,762 --> 02:05:06,322
''Punjabi, the merry Punjabi's.''

2265
02:05:06,899 --> 02:05:09,766
''Punjabi, the merry Punjabi's.''

2266
02:05:10,102 --> 02:05:13,594
''Punjabi, the merry Punjabi's.''

2267
02:05:13,806 --> 02:05:17,105
''Punjabi, the merry Punjabi's.''

2268
02:05:17,643 --> 02:05:20,771
''Standing tall with
a broad chest-chest.''

2269
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:24,281
''Everyone says they're best-best.''

2270
02:05:24,683 --> 02:05:26,776
''The Jatt's look so majestic.''

2271
02:05:26,986 --> 02:05:29,784
''Punjabi, the merry Punjabi's.''

2272
02:05:30,189 --> 02:05:32,987
''Punjabi, the merry Punjabi's.''

2273
02:05:33,259 --> 02:05:36,786
''Punjabi, the merry Punjabi's.''

2274
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:44,029
''Punjabi, the merry Punjabi's.''

2275
02:05:52,344 --> 02:05:54,869
Standing tall with a
broad chest-chest.

2276
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:57,941
Everyone says they're best-best.

2277
02:05:58,083 --> 02:05:59,175
Boss.

2278
02:06:00,152 --> 02:06:02,211
lt's him. He's the one
from the railway tracks.

2279
02:06:02,321 --> 02:06:04,380
Punjabi, the merry Punjabi's.

2280
02:06:04,690 --> 02:06:05,782
What is he doing here?

2281
02:06:05,958 --> 02:06:07,789
Punjabi, the merry Punjabi's.

2282
02:06:07,893 --> 02:06:10,327
Brother-in-law, who is he?
- The angel of death.

2283
02:06:11,297 --> 02:06:14,892
Death always hovers around him.

2284
02:06:16,335 --> 02:06:19,771
Give me a last glass
of 'Lassi' (Buttermilk).

2285
02:06:21,073 --> 02:06:22,700
Brother-in-law, he's
asking for his last 'Lassi'.

2286
02:06:22,808 --> 02:06:26,209
Raja, get him some
'Lassi-wassi' with extra butter.

2287
02:06:26,312 --> 02:06:27,711
Hey, rascal.

2288
02:06:28,414 --> 02:06:30,712
l only ordered for
'Lassi' what is 'wassi'?

2289
02:06:31,183 --> 02:06:35,051
'Mutton-shatton', 'Murga-surga',
'Chai-shai', Parathe-sharathe'.

2290
02:06:35,821 --> 02:06:37,379
You always mention two
things but feed only one.

2291
02:06:37,489 --> 02:06:40,083
Scoundrel, stop talking nonsense.

2292
02:06:40,292 --> 02:06:42,385
Or else l swear l will kill you.

2293
02:06:42,761 --> 02:06:45,093
What do you say? Let's kill him?
- Yes, let's kill him.

2294
02:06:45,197 --> 02:06:47,165
How can you kill me? Death
couldn't kill me himself.

2295
02:06:47,399 --> 02:06:49,162
But this time l've made
foolproof arrangements.

2296
02:06:49,735 --> 02:06:53,000
l will surely die, but all
of you will die with me.

2297
02:06:53,339 --> 02:06:54,897
Death is very closeby.

2298
02:06:55,007 --> 02:06:56,099
Closeby?

2299
02:06:58,010 --> 02:06:59,739
What are you looking around for?

2300
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:01,769
lt's coming from above.

2301
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:02,938
l have unscrewed all
the bolts of the ceiling.

2302
02:07:21,967 --> 02:07:23,901
Go. Go to heaven.

2303
02:07:28,874 --> 02:07:29,966
Help us.

2304
02:07:30,075 --> 02:07:31,133
Hold it tight.

2305
02:07:31,243 --> 02:07:32,335
Or else we'll die.

2306
02:07:35,114 --> 02:07:36,945
You all warded off death again.

2307
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:40,310
But, you won't be able to
do it for long. - Quiet.

2308
02:07:40,419 --> 02:07:43,217
You always try to
die wherever we are.

2309
02:07:43,389 --> 02:07:44,947
How will l go to my village now?

2310
02:07:46,058 --> 02:07:47,855
Papa.
- lf l die..

2311
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:49,257
Don't say that, Papa.

2312
02:07:51,196 --> 02:07:53,130
Your son is still alive.

2313
02:07:53,232 --> 02:07:55,291
Son. Why you..

2314
02:07:55,401 --> 02:07:57,096
l don't mean anything.

2315
02:07:57,803 --> 02:08:01,170
Did you come to save your
papa or to abduct the girl?

2316
02:08:01,373 --> 02:08:02,431
lf l hadn't done that..

2317
02:08:02,541 --> 02:08:04,771
..then Marcos would've
killed our entire family.

2318
02:08:04,977 --> 02:08:07,138
What family?
- You're my papa.

2319
02:08:07,479 --> 02:08:09,413
He isn't my friend
but my younger brother.

2320
02:08:09,515 --> 02:08:11,380
Your brother is dead.

2321
02:08:11,583 --> 02:08:13,107
For the sake of the diamonds..

2322
02:08:13,218 --> 02:08:14,446
..you told them to kill us.

2323
02:08:14,820 --> 02:08:15,980
Keep your diamonds with you.

2324
02:08:16,855 --> 02:08:18,288
No, Raj.
Brother-in-law didn't say that.

2325
02:08:19,358 --> 02:08:23,419
She is right. Marcos wanted to kill
me for the diamonds. - No. Sophie.

2326
02:08:23,529 --> 02:08:25,929
That scoundrel was
instigating you against me..

2327
02:08:26,031 --> 02:08:28,363
..that's why l
instigated his men against him.

2328
02:08:29,201 --> 02:08:31,362
Half the diamonds that are
there with them are worth millions.

2329
02:08:31,470 --> 02:08:33,199
But not more precious than you.

2330
02:08:33,305 --> 02:08:34,897
They've got diamonds
worth millions.

2331
02:08:35,874 --> 02:08:37,000
Dying cancelled.

2332
02:08:37,176 --> 02:08:38,973
Come on, give the diamonds.

2333
02:08:39,078 --> 02:08:41,069
Hey, l'll kill you if
you touch the diamonds.

2334
02:08:41,313 --> 02:08:44,111
You'll kill me if
your hands are free.

2335
02:08:44,349 --> 02:08:46,146
Come on.
- Hey.

2336
02:08:46,251 --> 02:08:48,344
Boss, don't let him
check your back-pocket.

2337
02:08:48,454 --> 02:08:50,422
Hey, shut up!
- Thank you. One minute. - Hey!

2338
02:08:53,892 --> 02:08:55,860
Money is an evil thing.

2339
02:08:58,597 --> 02:09:00,861
Look, if you come ahead..
l'll kick you.

2340
02:09:00,966 --> 02:09:02,365
You will go ten feet down. Got it?

2341
02:09:02,468 --> 02:09:05,198
You'll kick me away but
this ceiling will fall on you.

2342
02:09:06,305 --> 02:09:07,397
Thank you.

2343
02:09:08,974 --> 02:09:10,236
Why you..

2344
02:09:11,110 --> 02:09:13,135
Brother, don't let him go.

2345
02:09:13,312 --> 02:09:14,904
Don't worry.

2346
02:09:15,013 --> 02:09:16,378
We won't spare him.

2347
02:09:20,586 --> 02:09:22,281
Hold it. l'm coming. -
l'll hold it. You go.

2348
02:09:22,387 --> 02:09:23,513
Hold on.

2349
02:09:40,906 --> 02:09:42,897
Grandpa.
- Dad.

2350
02:09:43,142 --> 02:09:45,633
Save me. Save me.

2351
02:09:48,013 --> 02:09:49,947
Beat him. Beat him.

2352
02:09:52,451 --> 02:09:54,146
What are you staring at?

2353
02:09:54,353 --> 02:09:57,584
Help us up or else we'll die.

2354
02:09:57,689 --> 02:09:59,486
lf we come there we'll die too.

2355
02:09:59,591 --> 02:10:02,219
Are Sardars afraid of dying?

2356
02:10:02,694 --> 02:10:04,662
He's absolutely right.

2357
02:10:04,963 --> 02:10:07,090
'Jo Bole So Nihaal' (What
you utter, shall be fulfilled).

2358
02:10:07,199 --> 02:10:09,429
'Sat Sri Akaal'
(Eternal is the Lord).

2359
02:10:13,138 --> 02:10:16,107
'Jo Bole So Nihaal' (What
you utter, shall be fulfilled).

2360
02:10:16,208 --> 02:10:19,177
'Sat Sri Akaal'
(Eternal is the Lord).

2361
02:10:20,546 --> 02:10:22,377
Father, why are you hanging here?

2362
02:10:22,581 --> 02:10:25,015
Stay quiet. Don't take a hasty
decision. Think with a cool head.

2363
02:10:25,117 --> 02:10:26,175
Hey, idiot, catch me.

2364
02:10:26,285 --> 02:10:29,379
Relax. Relax or l'll hit you.

2365
02:10:39,598 --> 02:10:41,498
What sort of a boss we have got?

2366
02:10:59,017 --> 02:11:00,143
Don't move.

2367
02:11:01,086 --> 02:11:02,178
You too.

2368
02:11:07,092 --> 02:11:08,150
Give me the diamonds, come on.

2369
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:10,091
Papa. We've got the diamonds.

2370
02:11:10,195 --> 02:11:11,719
Hey, you fool.

2371
02:11:12,130 --> 02:11:13,461
Give it to me. Give it to me.

2372
02:11:14,032 --> 02:11:15,090
Throw it.

2373
02:11:15,734 --> 02:11:17,167
Throw it.

2374
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:19,262
Throw it.

2375
02:11:22,641 --> 02:11:23,733
l've got them.

2376
02:11:25,043 --> 02:11:29,036
Marcos. l've heard that
there's a reward on your head.

2377
02:11:29,181 --> 02:11:30,375
Boss, don't tell him.

2378
02:11:39,391 --> 02:11:41,552
Son.
- Papa, run.

2379
02:12:15,527 --> 02:12:16,619
Shoot them.

2380
02:12:18,163 --> 02:12:19,221
Marcous.

2381
02:12:25,237 --> 02:12:27,034
Why you..

2382
02:12:49,795 --> 02:12:51,092
lt's the same one. -
lt's the same one.

2383
02:12:55,133 --> 02:12:56,293
Thank you.

2384
02:13:00,839 --> 02:13:02,739
No problem.

2385
02:13:16,355 --> 02:13:17,549
Raj.

2386
02:13:19,624 --> 02:13:20,750
Catch it.

2387
02:13:22,227 --> 02:13:23,387
Give it here.

2388
02:13:27,532 --> 02:13:28,624
Pick it up.

2389
02:13:29,334 --> 02:13:30,426
Pick it up.

2390
02:13:43,482 --> 02:13:44,574
Uncle.

2391
02:13:45,317 --> 02:13:46,409
Old man.

2392
02:13:56,595 --> 02:13:57,755
Give me. Give me.

2393
02:13:59,197 --> 02:14:00,528
Tuktuk. Hey!

2394
02:14:00,799 --> 02:14:01,891
Come on.

2395
02:14:42,674 --> 02:14:44,642
Listen, you fool.

2396
02:14:44,743 --> 02:14:47,211
'Lassi' is just 'lassi' after all.

2397
02:14:47,412 --> 02:14:49,846
And 'wassi' is our love.
You make fun of us.

2398
02:14:49,981 --> 02:14:52,506
l know, l know.
You're all very honest.

2399
02:14:52,617 --> 02:14:55,211
l was only instigating all
of you so that you kill me.

2400
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:57,288
But why do you want to die?

2401
02:14:57,389 --> 02:14:59,220
What should l stay alive for?

2402
02:14:59,524 --> 02:15:02,755
My family was crushed
under a tanker in Rajapatti.

2403
02:15:02,861 --> 02:15:03,953
l had their photo.

2404
02:15:04,262 --> 02:15:05,661
Just a minute. Just a minute.

2405
02:15:05,764 --> 02:15:08,426
You said that your
family was in Afghanistan.

2406
02:15:08,533 --> 02:15:10,592
Yes, but he said lraq to us.

2407
02:15:10,702 --> 02:15:11,794
Where is your family?

2408
02:15:11,903 --> 02:15:14,428
Your family, my family..
Doesn't humanity have any family?

2409
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:16,834
No matter who dies in
any corner of the world..

2410
02:15:16,942 --> 02:15:18,500
..but it's humanity
that's murdered after all.

2411
02:15:18,610 --> 02:15:19,838
That's right.
- That's why l am dying.

2412
02:15:19,945 --> 02:15:22,379
But l can live. lf l
get these diamonds.

2413
02:15:22,481 --> 02:15:23,971
But what will you do
with the diamonds?

2414
02:15:24,282 --> 02:15:25,840
l'll give it to America..

2415
02:15:26,017 --> 02:15:28,349
..and tell them to
maintain peace all over the world.

2416
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:30,750
You are right. - He should get
the diamonds. - That's right.

2417
02:15:30,856 --> 02:15:32,323
But, brother,
where are the diamonds?

2418
02:15:32,424 --> 02:15:34,324
He has one bag.

2419
02:15:34,426 --> 02:15:37,862
Catch him. Catch him.

2420
02:16:06,291 --> 02:16:07,952
No.

2421
02:16:19,638 --> 02:16:20,935
Diamonds.

2422
02:16:26,478 --> 02:16:28,912
The fishes are
swallowing the diamonds.

2423
02:16:36,388 --> 02:16:39,983
Boss. - Diamonds.
- Boss.

2424
02:16:40,492 --> 02:16:44,792
Where are you all going?
The tank will explode.

2425
02:16:49,668 --> 02:16:53,069
The fishes swallowed the
diamonds and went into the ocean.

2426
02:16:53,538 --> 02:16:56,371
All the diamonds are gone.

2427
02:16:56,474 --> 02:16:58,066
Boss, our diamonds are gone.

2428
02:16:58,376 --> 02:17:00,071
The fish have the diamonds now.

2429
02:17:00,378 --> 02:17:01,936
Boss, don't cry.

2430
02:17:02,113 --> 02:17:04,581
We've lost the
diamonds and the girl.

2431
02:17:06,518 --> 02:17:10,682
No one knows till date where
Sophiya went after this incident.

2432
02:17:12,057 --> 02:17:17,723
Marcos and his friends got
punished. 440 years prison term.

2433
