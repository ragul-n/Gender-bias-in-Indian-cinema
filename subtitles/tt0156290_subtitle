00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,345
Khanna here.

2
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:44,517
I'm Kapoor speaking.

3
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,842
When did you come?
- Just now and..

4
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:49,579
..I called you immediately.
- How are you?

5
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:52,342
Fine. Come here,
maybe something will happen here..

6
00:00:52,456 --> 00:00:55,076
Not today. I've to go to Mr. Sen's party.

7
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:57,524
You come along too.
- Sen? Who Sen?

8
00:00:57,722 --> 00:01:00,079
He's the editor of such a big newspaper,
don't you know him?

9
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:04,756
You mean Aman Sen! Okay.
- His marriage anniversary party.

10
00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:06,261
Marriage anniversary party?

11
00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:09,939
Since how long is he married?
- This is the 6th marriage anniversary.

12
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,239
6th marriage anniversary?

13
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:34,482
Hello.
- Meena here.

14
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:37,383
I'm Paresh.
- Where were you yesterday?

15
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:39,903
Leave it.
Tell me what is your plan today?

16
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:45,777
My parents are going for the marriage
anniversary of Mr. and Mrs. Sen.

17
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,021
Okay.
- Call me after 10 minutes..

18
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:49,749
..I'll tell you everything.
- Okay.

19
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,441
Do call!
- Okay.

20
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,302
Okay. Bye.

21
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:15,447
Hello, Mr. Sinha.
- Hello.

22
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:17,169
Congratulation.
- Thank you.

23
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:19,764
My wife is there.

24
00:02:19,842 --> 00:02:20,885
Please come.
- Thank you.

25
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,438
Hello.
- Hello.

26
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:35,124
Congrats. Sorry for delay.

27
00:02:35,664 --> 00:02:38,466
Son was alone as nanny didn't come.

28
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:46,042
Whatever you say, your son is very cute.
- That is there.

29
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:47,941
But he's become very naughty.

30
00:02:48,243 --> 00:02:49,571
He is always with the nanny.

31
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:52,151
I never take him with me.
- I see.

32
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:56,681
I'm very busy in parties.
That's why I have to go.

33
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:57,829
What to do?

34
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,235
He's not keeping well.

35
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:06,299
What to do, he's very naughty.

36
00:03:06,377 --> 00:03:08,136
I never take him anywhere.

37
00:03:08,214 --> 00:03:11,987
But as nanny's not there, I got him.

38
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,835
Same routine job.

39
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,840
Please line to Mr. Saxena.

40
00:04:47,422 --> 00:04:48,864
Come. The dinner is ready.

41
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:18,299
Have something.

42
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:21,008
You are not having anything at all.

43
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:22,710
Please have it.

44
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,264
That's okay.

45
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:36,903
No, Mr. Saxena.
But it is demarcation not discrimination.

46
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:39,571
Yes, that's right.

47
00:06:40,257 --> 00:06:41,315
Yes.

48
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:47,210
Yes, And check it clearly.

49
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:48,414
It's very important.

50
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:24,104
Hello.
- Hello.

51
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,207
I'm Mrs. Sinha speaking.

52
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:30,414
Actually, my son..

53
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:34,680
Yes. he's here. He's sleeping now.

54
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,244
I'll send him to you tomorrow morning.

55
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:39,860
My son's nanny is here.

56
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,630
And she cannot sleep without him.

57
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,066
So, I'll come to take him.

58
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:50,311
Okay.
- Thank a lot.

59
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:28,788
Okay, Hari. Go and sleep.

60
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,320
It's too late.

61
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:34,475
It's just 2'O clock.

62
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:41,427
What should I do?
There is so much work to do.

63
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:47,291
Sir, I think, your world moves
in a different manner.

64
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:48,713
Why?

65
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:55,469
Now see, God has made days
to work and nights to rest.

66
00:11:56,342 --> 00:12:01,188
But you don't seem to notice
if it's day or night. Only work.

67
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,847
Why does a person work?

68
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,255
So that he gets some rest.

69
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,037
But if there is no rest
then why should he work?

70
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:14,628
Hari, work never seems to happen.

71
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,821
Everything gets done in life,
except work!

72
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:23,792
Whatever you say, rule is a rule.

73
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:28,639
And when you work for the whole day
you should sleep for at least 8 hours.

74
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:37,097
Hari, according to you,
a person should sleep for 7 to 8 hours!

75
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,186
Yes.

76
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:45,296
So it's necessary to sleep
for 1 and 1/3rd of the day.

77
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:46,656
Yes.

78
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:48,898
Okay, Okay.

79
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:52,240
Come on. Let's calculate.

80
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:58,530
Now think of a person
whose age is 60 years.

81
00:12:58,607 --> 00:12:59,609
Ok.
- Yes.

82
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:07,963
Your accordingly, he'll be sleeping
for 20 years of his life.

83
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:13,490
He'll keep bathing for 2-3 years.

84
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:17,203
He'll eat for 3 to 4 years.

85
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:20,088
2 years for life style.

86
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,952
And if he doesn't have a car, then..

87
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:29,673
..he will spend 5 years
just waiting for the bus.

88
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:41,010
So after calculations you'll see
he gets 5 to 6 years for himself.

89
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:46,387
So if you wanted to do everything
for yourself why did you marry?

90
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,019
I'll lock this room tomorrow.

91
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:52,059
I've never seen this.

92
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:54,818
You work here day and night
and madam is..

93
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,480
That's why I am working here.

94
00:13:58,414 --> 00:14:01,776
Think if I work in that room
for the whole night..

95
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,810
..then won't your madam
get angry on me?

96
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,395
But what is the need to work
for that long?

97
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,448
Every work should happen in its own time.
- Okay. Go and sleep.

98
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:12,953
It's too late.

99
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:25,143
Close the door.

100
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:51,160
Atul, go keep it on the trolley.

101
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,563
How many times
I've told you not to do this.

102
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,189
Give me that. Go.

103
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:02,066
Listen, I won't come for the lunch today.

104
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,329
Bye Meeta.

105
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:10,349
Sir is not coming for the lunch.
What should I prepare for you?

106
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,598
You all can cook for yourselves.
I won't have anything.

107
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,636
Are you alright?

108
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:24,852
Yes.

109
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:28,803
Anything else.

110
00:18:32,562 --> 00:18:36,606
Listen, everyone should be
here till 4 O' clock.

111
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:39,201
Don't go anywhere.
- Okay.

112
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:46,187
I forgot,
they have written a letter that..

113
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:56,465
Thank you very much.
But I don't know about his schedule.

114
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,637
He'll come, if he's free.

115
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:02,719
Thank you for remembering us.

116
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:03,954
Bye.

117
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,033
What are you reading?

118
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,749
Come.

119
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,908
All day he is busy in book.
- Oh man, I couldn't shave.

120
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,814
Atul, come. Let's play.

121
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:47,206
I won't play.
- Forget him, weird man.

122
00:20:47,284 --> 00:20:49,843
What are you saying?
- Nothing special.

123
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:52,250
I don't feel good in this house.

124
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,338
Who likes it? I too left that hotel job
and came to this house.

125
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,129
I'll work as a family member
of the house.

126
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:01,332
But even this house is like a hotel.

127
00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:03,668
There is no relationship.

128
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:07,062
I'm here since last 4 years but..

129
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:09,646
..sir doesn't know my name till today..

130
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:12,822
..nor did I come to know
anything about sir or madam.

131
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:15,531
All I've heard is the bell.

132
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,153
If it rings this way sir wants tea.

133
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:22,059
If this way, then madam wants tea.

134
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:25,214
If it rings this way
then sir wants breakfast..

135
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:27,704
If this way then
we should call the driver.

136
00:21:27,944 --> 00:21:29,811
Leave it, man. Let's play cards.

137
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:42,930
What happened?

138
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:46,843
Listen, I've been blessed with a baby boy.
- Good.

139
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:48,824
Please pray for me too.

140
00:21:48,992 --> 00:21:53,578
Congratulations. That's a good news.
Hurry up and go get some sweets.

141
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:57,584
First we'll offer a feast
and then pray for you as well.

142
00:22:01,534 --> 00:22:02,820
Okay. Bye. Thank you.

143
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,542
Residence.

144
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,616
7:30 pm.

145
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,107
Hello, Meeta.

146
00:22:22,635 --> 00:22:25,385
Do you remember,
we met a painter in Paris!

147
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:27,674
Moshe Aundre..

148
00:22:29,275 --> 00:22:31,235
We visited his house.

149
00:22:32,865 --> 00:22:36,445
The one you said makes
good landscapes..

150
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,489
..but looks like a businessman.

151
00:22:38,884 --> 00:22:40,003
Not looks like the artist.

152
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:41,425
Do you remember?

153
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,646
He has come here yesterday.

154
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:46,725
And I've invited him for dinner
day after tomorrow. Okay?

155
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:48,375
Excuse me.
- Hold on. Yes.

156
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,534
The people you'd called
for interview have come.

157
00:22:51,612 --> 00:22:52,665
Okay. I'll come.

158
00:22:53,362 --> 00:22:55,987
Listen I called some people
for the interview.

159
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,512
I'll have to go.

160
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,421
Fine? Okay.

161
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,611
I've settled all your dues.

162
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:23,733
Take this salary for 2 months.

163
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:27,960
I hope you'll get some job soon.

164
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,382
Madam.
- Do you want more money?

165
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:53,482
What are you doing?

166
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:56,469
You won't find sincere servants
like them in these days.

167
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:58,612
I don't need your advice.
- But Madam..

168
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,704
Hari, you've started to speak
too much these days.

169
00:24:00,924 --> 00:24:02,054
Yes.

170
00:24:02,163 --> 00:24:03,465
I'll speak.

171
00:24:03,723 --> 00:24:04,676
Hari!

172
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:07,191
Sir was very young when I came here.

173
00:24:07,451 --> 00:24:10,314
And you said to take the salary
for 2 months and leave.

174
00:24:11,476 --> 00:24:13,478
Have you seen a dream?

175
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:16,288
Have you seen it grow in your hands?

176
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,107
You're the boss,
you may tell me to leave.

177
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:21,732
But how will I leave?

178
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:24,575
How should I tell you this?

179
00:24:25,427 --> 00:24:27,439
You have never been a horse for someone.

180
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,199
I'm the old horse of sir.

181
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,659
Hari.
- No, no.

182
00:24:33,293 --> 00:24:35,441
You can't ask me to leave.

183
00:24:35,971 --> 00:24:38,024
Even sir can't ask me to leave.

184
00:24:38,565 --> 00:24:41,345
I'll leave this house only
when I'll die.

185
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:43,680
This is my home!
- Home?

186
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:47,229
Is this a home?

187
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:51,796
You may never have seen a hotel.

188
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:59,621
Had you seen one, you would know
that this house is a very good hotel.

189
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:03,502
Where you get everything.

190
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:05,993
But still there is something missing.

191
00:25:06,544 --> 00:25:07,612
Affection.

192
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,449
That's why you..
- Yes Hari.

193
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:13,590
I'm bored of this life in this hotel.

194
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:17,306
Now I want a home. I want my own family.

195
00:25:18,044 --> 00:25:20,325
If this is the case,
then even I'll leave.

196
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:23,699
Don't. If you were only a servant then..

197
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:26,158
..you'd have gone along
with the rest of them.

198
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:28,868
I made a mistake.
Forgive me please.

199
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,811
What are you saying?
You are the boss.

200
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,320
We are leaving.
Please come here.

201
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:38,758
They are leaving.
May I go to see them, daughter in law.

202
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:43,699
Daughter in law.

203
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,793
What are you doing?
- Hari.

204
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,669
Yes, daughter in law.

205
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:19,349
Daughter-in-law?
Since when are you his daughter in law?

206
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,936
I'd given you the list. Where is it?

207
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,447
Go and get it.

208
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,940
And tell them to give
the bill of last month.

209
00:26:29,252 --> 00:26:30,445
Okay.

210
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:38,156
So you were saying?

211
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:40,314
Where have all the people gone?

212
00:26:40,636 --> 00:26:43,148
Why are you missing them?

213
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,240
This is not the answer.

214
00:26:47,051 --> 00:26:48,981
I don't know about the questions
and the answers.

215
00:26:49,293 --> 00:26:50,755
But still I'll ask you one question.

216
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:52,176
Ask me.

217
00:26:53,184 --> 00:26:55,995
When all of them are here
and I'm not there.

218
00:26:56,411 --> 00:26:58,548
Do you miss me?

219
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,069
May be not!

220
00:27:07,568 --> 00:27:09,923
As I'm just a decoration peace
of this house.

221
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:11,749
Not a necessity.

222
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,099
Aman, I've removed
all the servants except for Hari..

223
00:27:16,141 --> 00:27:17,745
..without your permission.

224
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:23,462
What? But how will this big family
run without the servants?

225
00:27:24,808 --> 00:27:26,506
So big is the family.

226
00:27:27,387 --> 00:27:29,506
One is you and the other one is me.

227
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:35,610
1 and 1 should've been 1
but it's better as 2.

228
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:42,034
You've kept this in such
a way that it looks as 11.

229
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:46,819
You won't find these nice
and efficient servants again.

230
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,873
I know.
That's the reason I removed them.

231
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,263
As you please. It's your family.

232
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:55,265
My family?

233
00:27:57,996 --> 00:28:01,202
I took 6 years to understand
the same thing.

234
00:28:01,705 --> 00:28:05,420
But Aman, do you call this a family?

235
00:28:06,122 --> 00:28:08,695
Why is this not a family?

236
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:18,642
If the family
I've come from is a family.

237
00:28:19,988 --> 00:28:22,893
Then this isn't a family.

238
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:27,356
What is it,
that you don't have in this house?

239
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:33,915
Only love and affection.

240
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:39,333
There were many things missing
in that family.

241
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:41,583
But not affection.

242
00:28:43,142 --> 00:28:46,722
When I was 12, my mother died.

243
00:28:48,955 --> 00:28:52,649
Try to imagine my condition.

244
00:28:54,861 --> 00:29:00,184
But when I saw my father,
I forgot all about losing her.

245
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:04,594
And in that young age,
I had to take my mother's place.

246
00:29:07,106 --> 00:29:10,063
I tried to do a lot for my father.

247
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:12,871
But how measurably I feeled.

248
00:29:14,113 --> 00:29:20,474
Aman, you couldn't prepare lentils like
my mother or make the bed.

249
00:29:21,365 --> 00:29:24,307
I couldn't do anything
the way my mother used to do.

250
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:32,763
She used to do the things easily
which were hard for me.

251
00:29:34,888 --> 00:29:36,889
Still my father said..

252
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:43,062
..you can't do the things
the way she did them.

253
00:29:45,697 --> 00:29:49,920
Aman, think!
If I die tomorrow..

254
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,392
..then will you feel the same way..

255
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,990
..my father used to feel for my mother.

256
00:30:01,056 --> 00:30:04,034
Aman.
- Oh, Meeta.

257
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:21,564
Hari, what is this?

258
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:24,698
When I rang the bell,
sir opened the door for me.

259
00:30:24,927 --> 00:30:27,116
This must be the thing everyone must be
asking madam..

260
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:30,925
..because when sir ringed the door bell,
she opened the door for him.

261
00:30:31,102 --> 00:30:32,990
Did the sun rise in the west today?

262
00:30:33,068 --> 00:30:34,827
No, in the east.

263
00:30:34,905 --> 00:30:36,300
I've seen with my own eyes.

264
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:39,995
But even I've seen sir opening the door.

265
00:30:40,073 --> 00:30:41,718
Still you didn't get it.

266
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:43,648
No.
- Stupid!

267
00:30:43,846 --> 00:30:46,720
When you go home.
Who opens the door for you?

268
00:30:46,969 --> 00:30:48,058
My wife!

269
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:50,622
And now if I come to your house,
and you're home..

270
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,103
..then who'll open the door for me?
- I will.

271
00:30:53,181 --> 00:30:57,669
Similarly when sir rang the bell
she opened the door..

272
00:30:57,746 --> 00:31:01,749
..and when you rang the bell,
sir opened the door.

273
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:04,862
I see. Where are the servants?

274
00:31:05,236 --> 00:31:08,027
They've left.
- Left?

275
00:31:08,105 --> 00:31:10,964
And now if you don't give me the cigarette
you'll also have to leave.

276
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:13,289
Take this.

277
00:31:21,883 --> 00:31:23,200
What are you doing? Leave it.

278
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,455
Can't you see.

279
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,050
I don't like this habit. Leave it.

280
00:31:27,446 --> 00:31:28,711
Even I don't like this.

281
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:29,853
Stand up.

282
00:31:30,507 --> 00:31:31,824
I'll have to stand up.

283
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:35,933
Because I've some other plans.

284
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:37,812
What plans?

285
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,711
I want to sit on your head.

286
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,240
But if I sit suddenly then won't you
be in trouble?

287
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:47,205
So I've decided to be modest.

288
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:49,987
Why not go step by step?

289
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:52,394
So did you like this idea?

290
00:32:15,273 --> 00:32:16,694
Are you still sitting here?

291
00:32:16,772 --> 00:32:17,919
I was searching for you..

292
00:33:42,512 --> 00:33:43,518
Hari.
- Yes.

293
00:33:43,596 --> 00:33:45,126
How much milk in tea?

294
00:33:46,342 --> 00:33:47,430
Enough.

295
00:33:48,469 --> 00:33:51,924
Put more sugar in it.
- I know that.

296
00:34:13,293 --> 00:34:14,475
Good morning sir.

297
00:34:19,717 --> 00:34:21,304
Good morning sir.

298
00:34:25,902 --> 00:34:27,303
Bed-tea is ready.

299
00:35:14,932 --> 00:35:17,235
Will this stain go merely by washing?

300
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:32,294
Hari, Hari.

301
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:35,034
I'm coming, daughter-in-law.

302
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,759
Give me one glass water.

303
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,524
One glass water.

304
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:04,551
Daughter in law, you take care
of the kitchen for some time.

305
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:05,568
Where are you going?

306
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:07,883
It's time for sir to leave for the office.

307
00:36:08,642 --> 00:36:11,485
Listen, you make some tea, please.

308
00:36:25,153 --> 00:36:28,442
One should do his own job,
others look stupid doing it.

309
00:36:29,013 --> 00:36:32,749
What's the meaning?
- Don't ask sir.

310
00:36:37,648 --> 00:36:38,331
Drink this.

311
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:39,473
No thanks.

312
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,822
Then why did you ask for it?

313
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,109
Because I wanted to change the clothes.

314
00:36:43,823 --> 00:36:45,587
To change clothes?

315
00:36:46,688 --> 00:36:48,866
Oh great!

316
00:36:49,894 --> 00:36:54,232
After eating hundred mice, the cat repents
by going to the Haj [pilgrimage].

317
00:37:08,543 --> 00:37:09,498
Wear this.

318
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,704
Hurry.

319
00:37:26,085 --> 00:37:27,640
What has happened to your cheeks?

320
00:37:28,918 --> 00:37:32,269
Editor sir, this is my cheek,
not a snack.

321
00:37:32,347 --> 00:37:34,844
That's fine, but still.

322
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,753
Stop being childish!

323
00:37:36,982 --> 00:37:38,725
Come for the breakfast.

324
00:37:47,817 --> 00:37:49,030
What are you doing here?

325
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,847
You called.

326
00:37:51,843 --> 00:37:53,680
Did you come before
I called you or after that?

327
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:55,215
Between that.

328
00:37:57,998 --> 00:38:00,499
If the driver is here, give him the keys.

329
00:38:00,576 --> 00:38:01,713
Okay.
- Listen, Hari.

330
00:38:02,066 --> 00:38:03,674
And you didn't bring
the grocery from the stores.

331
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:05,687
Go and get it.
- Ok.

332
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:07,109
I'll find out right away.

333
00:39:00,725 --> 00:39:01,980
Lunch at 1:15 pm sharp.

334
00:39:24,803 --> 00:39:26,680
Hari.
- Yes, daughter in law.

335
00:39:27,387 --> 00:39:28,652
Hari, you didn't bring
ginger and chillies?

336
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:30,022
They are there.

337
00:40:39,717 --> 00:40:45,092
"If my heart was mine.."

338
00:40:48,331 --> 00:40:52,595
"I would catch it on the eyelid.."

339
00:40:56,313 --> 00:41:00,878
"..carry it on my lips."

340
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:08,849
"I'd have divinity in my hands."

341
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,395
"If only my heart.."

342
00:41:17,372 --> 00:41:21,857
"I'd crush the Sun.."

343
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:29,371
"..and apply it like sandalwood."

344
00:41:34,135 --> 00:41:38,597
"By taking the body of gold.."

345
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:46,381
"..I'd burn like the sandalwood."

346
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:55,027
"The mirror would have been.."

347
00:41:59,201 --> 00:42:02,978
"..flattered by this fair face."

348
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:05,604
"If only my heart.."

349
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:22,873
"The clouds have poured
into the sea for so long."

350
00:42:27,669 --> 00:42:32,920
"There is a drop like a moon.."

351
00:42:35,858 --> 00:42:39,822
"..which didn't go to the sea."

352
00:42:43,892 --> 00:42:48,333
"If it went to two hands and.."

353
00:42:52,246 --> 00:42:56,221
"..what would happen if it fell down?"

354
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:00,049
"Then divinity would be
there in my hands."

355
00:43:00,498 --> 00:43:04,077
"If my heart was mine.."

356
00:43:04,712 --> 00:43:09,381
"I would catch it on the eyelids.."

357
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:18,887
"Then divinity would be
there in my hands."

358
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,475
"If only my heart.."

359
00:43:37,642 --> 00:43:39,904
Do you want to say that
you won't come for lunch?

360
00:43:39,982 --> 00:43:41,004
I can't tolerate.

361
00:43:41,182 --> 00:43:44,906
Hello. Is it 362595.

362
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,795
That's right.

363
00:43:47,097 --> 00:43:48,445
Can I speak to Mrs. Sen please.

364
00:43:48,913 --> 00:43:49,825
Speaking.

365
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:53,883
Meeta, I'm Shashi here.

366
00:43:56,563 --> 00:43:58,430
Where did you get my number?

367
00:43:58,508 --> 00:44:00,028
From the directory.

368
00:44:00,484 --> 00:44:01,490
What do you want?

369
00:44:01,813 --> 00:44:03,234
I want to meet you.

370
00:44:06,483 --> 00:44:08,029
I don't want to meet you.

371
00:44:08,653 --> 00:44:10,270
Why? Are you afraid?

372
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:12,015
You surprised me.

373
00:44:12,513 --> 00:44:14,516
But I must meet you.

374
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:19,663
If it's that important.

375
00:44:19,861 --> 00:44:22,424
Come in the evening
when he's at home.

376
00:44:23,047 --> 00:44:25,122
But I wanted to meet you alone.

377
00:44:25,725 --> 00:44:27,904
But I don't want that.

378
00:44:30,343 --> 00:44:32,875
I'm coming at 4'o clock.

379
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:36,248
Hello? Hello?

380
00:45:41,946 --> 00:45:43,118
Hello.
- Meeta.

381
00:45:44,903 --> 00:45:48,285
I am sorry, Meeta. I'll be late.

382
00:45:48,992 --> 00:45:50,361
Till what time?

383
00:45:51,037 --> 00:45:52,509
Might be till 2.15 pm.

384
00:45:52,894 --> 00:45:53,806
Okay.

385
00:45:54,005 --> 00:45:56,110
If feel hungry, eat the food.

386
00:45:56,496 --> 00:45:58,218
No. I will eat the food with you.

387
00:46:01,073 --> 00:46:03,064
You are not angry, are you?
- No.

388
00:46:06,251 --> 00:46:07,848
You are not upset, are you?
- No.

389
00:46:09,562 --> 00:46:11,304
I'll come as soon as the work gets over.

390
00:46:11,866 --> 00:46:12,892
Okay.

391
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:15,051
Bye.
- Bye.

392
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:22,960
Should I serve the lunch?

393
00:46:25,192 --> 00:46:27,256
Sir will come at 2.30 pm.

394
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:53,740
I've got a splendid idea
for today's dinner.

395
00:46:53,818 --> 00:46:54,685
Is it?
- Yes.

396
00:46:54,862 --> 00:47:00,299
When we go to foreign countries
like Rome, Italy, France etc.

397
00:47:00,377 --> 00:47:05,292
Those people treat us according
to their culture and tradition..

398
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:08,489
..but when they come to our nation
we treat them according..

399
00:47:08,566 --> 00:47:10,108
..to their customs and traditions!

400
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:11,421
This is right.

401
00:47:11,463 --> 00:47:12,817
What right?
- Is it not?

402
00:47:13,016 --> 00:47:14,291
No, that's what I'm saying.

403
00:47:15,444 --> 00:47:17,467
Then we should do something.
- Exactly.

404
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:22,470
So today's dinner will be served
in a traditional Indian manner.

405
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,151
We'll sit on the ground.

406
00:47:24,453 --> 00:47:25,448
How's idea?

407
00:47:26,258 --> 00:47:27,243
Good.

408
00:47:27,452 --> 00:47:30,232
But a little problem is there.
- What?

409
00:47:31,095 --> 00:47:34,456
Suppose he's wearing a tight pant?

410
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:35,847
It'll be great fun.

411
00:47:36,076 --> 00:47:38,950
When he'll have to do
all the exercise he'll know..

412
00:47:39,028 --> 00:47:41,078
..how simple the Indian culture is.

413
00:47:42,137 --> 00:47:44,917
Good. Now do one thing.
- What?

414
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:47,335
Wash your hands.
- No.

415
00:47:47,844 --> 00:47:49,586
Alu-parathas will get cold.

416
00:47:49,664 --> 00:47:52,565
I'll wash my hands immediately.

417
00:48:18,566 --> 00:48:20,122
You start. I'll take it.

418
00:48:27,979 --> 00:48:30,064
Whose idea was this to make parathas?

419
00:48:30,252 --> 00:48:31,278
Daughter in law's.

420
00:48:31,356 --> 00:48:32,855
Did she prepare it herself.
- Yes.

421
00:48:34,518 --> 00:48:35,285
Wrong number.

422
00:48:35,363 --> 00:48:36,271
I'll check the kitchen.

423
00:48:40,341 --> 00:48:41,792
Whose call was that?
- Don't know.

424
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:42,831
Some stupid man called.

425
00:48:42,909 --> 00:48:44,937
From the Ambassador Hotel.

426
00:48:57,808 --> 00:48:58,938
Splendid!

427
00:49:00,028 --> 00:49:01,429
I'll take the call.

428
00:49:20,018 --> 00:49:21,138
What?

429
00:49:21,844 --> 00:49:23,266
Sorry, wrong number.

430
00:49:28,984 --> 00:49:34,670
How will these people know that I'm
eating the Alu-parathas made by my wife.

431
00:49:36,467 --> 00:49:38,044
You also have some.

432
00:49:38,502 --> 00:49:39,331
You eat it.

433
00:49:39,373 --> 00:49:40,760
I am eating.

434
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:46,461
After so many years
I'm having these Parathas.

435
00:49:46,796 --> 00:49:50,925
You know this Hari, His wife..

436
00:49:51,002 --> 00:49:54,941
I know. Don't talk while eating.

437
00:50:01,128 --> 00:50:03,090
What's there to laugh so much?

438
00:50:03,298 --> 00:50:05,735
I remembered my father.

439
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:09,546
He'd be very angry
when anyone used to speak on table.

440
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:14,143
What are you doing?

441
00:50:14,694 --> 00:50:18,107
Now I know that you have made it
and that they are good.

442
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:19,622
But it is my stomach.

443
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:22,985
If I'll eat 2
then you should have atleast 6.

444
00:50:25,196 --> 00:50:29,263
Now-a-days only two
or three are enough.

445
00:50:29,846 --> 00:50:31,672
I was talking of the Parathas!

446
00:50:31,984 --> 00:50:33,550
Me too!

447
00:50:34,713 --> 00:50:40,192
Is this grow more food
but eat as less as a cat.

448
00:51:00,971 --> 00:51:03,315
You are spoiling me.

449
00:51:04,354 --> 00:51:08,795
If this honour continues for long
then I won't be of any use.

450
00:51:08,873 --> 00:51:10,165
What do you mean?

451
00:51:10,353 --> 00:51:14,067
I mean, that by having such
a nice food can anyone work?

452
00:51:14,566 --> 00:51:16,402
I feel like I should sleep right now.

453
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,646
Take this.
- What's this?

454
00:51:35,104 --> 00:51:37,417
You wanted to sleep, so sleep.

455
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,365
Someday you'll put me out of work.

456
00:51:43,442 --> 00:51:45,201
You only said it.

457
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,474
I'm sorry.

458
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,858
Tell me one thing,
should I call a cook for tonight?

459
00:51:51,129 --> 00:51:53,950
For what?
You've called only one person.

460
00:51:54,326 --> 00:51:55,820
I and Hari will manage.

461
00:51:57,212 --> 00:51:58,922
I forgot to tell you.
- What?

462
00:51:59,089 --> 00:52:00,999
I've called four more people!

463
00:52:01,457 --> 00:52:03,396
So what?
- Okay, let's do one thing.

464
00:52:03,906 --> 00:52:05,046
I'll take leave today.

465
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,457
Also, let me tell you that my holiday
today was spent in Meeta's kitchen.

466
00:52:10,434 --> 00:52:12,861
Sleep if you want to.

467
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:14,324
Why are you making excuses?

468
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,319
You can't help me in the kitchen,
but only cause trouble.

469
00:52:18,787 --> 00:52:20,716
But..
- No talk now.

470
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:23,861
You leave for the office..

471
00:52:24,163 --> 00:52:27,919
..so that I can handle
the situation on my own.

472
00:52:28,656 --> 00:52:30,950
Okay as you please.

473
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:32,921
I am leaving.

474
00:52:32,998 --> 00:52:38,307
I'll reach home with
the guest exactly at 8.30. Bye.

475
00:52:38,485 --> 00:52:39,812
Bye.

476
00:52:43,591 --> 00:52:46,662
Hari, you didn't eat anything?

477
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,998
I'll have it. What's the hurry?

478
00:52:49,076 --> 00:52:51,739
Don't you want to go to
Shanta's place in Colaba?

479
00:52:52,258 --> 00:52:55,413
It takes two hours to reach there.

480
00:52:55,490 --> 00:53:01,151
And today the guest are coming
how are we going to cook the food?

481
00:53:01,229 --> 00:53:03,133
Don't worry, I'll handle.

482
00:53:03,211 --> 00:53:05,676
You eat fast.
And I'll write the letter for you.

483
00:53:05,895 --> 00:53:07,294
And see..

484
00:53:07,372 --> 00:53:08,260
Hurry up.

485
00:53:20,019 --> 00:53:27,615
"Somebody quietly reveal to
in her dreams.."

486
00:53:27,865 --> 00:53:30,936
"..that I'm coming."

487
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:36,707
"How do I know who's coming?"

488
00:53:38,202 --> 00:53:40,910
"Somebody quietly.."

489
00:53:43,547 --> 00:53:44,771
Yes.

490
00:53:45,819 --> 00:53:48,247
Won't you call me inside?
- Why are you here?

491
00:53:49,285 --> 00:53:52,793
We don't behave in this manner
even with the enemy.

492
00:53:53,115 --> 00:53:54,619
Why are you here?

493
00:53:56,602 --> 00:53:59,839
Don't worry by thinking about the past.

494
00:53:59,917 --> 00:54:04,281
I'm not worried. I've forgotten the past.

495
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:10,706
Meeta, don't behave this way.

496
00:54:12,264 --> 00:54:14,651
I want to respect you.

497
00:54:16,426 --> 00:54:20,566
Let's once again meet like strangers,
and know each other.

498
00:54:21,522 --> 00:54:23,037
Like two wise humans.

499
00:54:24,002 --> 00:54:25,818
Come let's go inside.

500
00:54:28,693 --> 00:54:30,013
Beautiful.

501
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,564
Really beautiful.

502
00:54:37,764 --> 00:54:38,925
Excellent.

503
00:54:42,164 --> 00:54:43,637
Give me one glass of water.

504
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:48,809
"How do I know who's coming?"

505
00:54:50,626 --> 00:54:53,344
"Somebody quietly.."

506
00:55:00,993 --> 00:55:08,859
"My thirsty heart seeks
the fire of love."

507
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:19,197
"The monsoon is trapped in my eyes,
my lips unable to utter it."

508
00:55:19,533 --> 00:55:23,349
"By the time the words spilled out,
it was night."

509
00:55:23,661 --> 00:55:28,020
"The rain of love left me alone."

510
00:55:28,098 --> 00:55:31,818
"By the time the words spilled out,
it was night."

511
00:55:32,193 --> 00:55:33,977
How do I sing so late in the night?

512
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:39,529
"See, yet somebody sings."

513
00:55:40,298 --> 00:55:45,486
"How do I know who sings?"

514
00:55:48,569 --> 00:55:51,848
I'm very pleased to see you happy.

515
00:55:52,035 --> 00:55:53,529
When did you see me happy?

516
00:55:53,872 --> 00:55:56,206
The time you got angry with me!

517
00:55:56,674 --> 00:55:57,825
What do you mean?

518
00:55:58,158 --> 00:56:02,567
It's simple.
If you wouldn't be happy then..

519
00:56:03,337 --> 00:56:05,516
..you wouldn't have got angry
with me this way!

520
00:56:05,797 --> 00:56:07,518
Stop the nonsense.

521
00:56:07,738 --> 00:56:09,180
Come to the point.

522
00:56:09,907 --> 00:56:11,037
Really.

523
00:56:11,464 --> 00:56:13,144
We've met after so many days..

524
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:18,281
..but instead of asking about each other,
we are speaking nonsense.

525
00:56:19,765 --> 00:56:24,227
Won't you sit down?
- Please Shashi, I'm going to have guests.

526
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:27,080
If this is the case then I'll leave.

527
00:56:27,475 --> 00:56:29,882
But why had you come here?

528
00:56:30,536 --> 00:56:34,832
I'm feeling hesitated..

529
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,853
You did not hesitate while coming.

530
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,399
What are you hesitating about now?

531
00:56:40,532 --> 00:56:42,263
You're right.

532
00:56:42,897 --> 00:56:45,730
I was here in Mumbai for last two days.

533
00:56:46,188 --> 00:56:47,661
I had come here for an interview.

534
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,061
The interview too
was conducted yesterday.

535
00:56:49,498 --> 00:56:51,386
Your husband Mr. Sen..

536
00:56:52,155 --> 00:56:53,949
You want him to help you?

537
00:56:54,543 --> 00:56:58,246
No. I want you to help me.

538
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,789
We can get that place
if you recommend.

539
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:03,851
Everything depends on Mr. Sen!

540
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:06,383
I don't interfere in his official matters.

541
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:07,586
What's the meaning?

542
00:57:07,664 --> 00:57:11,074
It's simple.
I won't do a favour for you.

543
00:57:13,649 --> 00:57:15,371
That's what I feared.

544
00:57:16,067 --> 00:57:18,484
The respect is gone,
and my work is also not done.

545
00:57:19,555 --> 00:57:22,418
This is the biggest tragedy
of people like me.

546
00:57:23,498 --> 00:57:25,926
I'll leave now.

547
00:57:27,255 --> 00:57:28,883
I bothered you unnecessarily.

548
00:57:49,614 --> 00:57:51,398
Hey, this marvelous.

549
00:57:52,693 --> 00:57:54,208
That is beautiful.

550
00:57:54,728 --> 00:57:56,314
You have a very nice place.

551
00:57:56,596 --> 00:57:57,923
Thank you.

552
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,244
Well, what was your first impression
when you are landed our country?

553
00:58:02,874 --> 00:58:04,835
I tell you honestly, Mr. Sen.

554
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:06,714
It is very difficult to say.

555
00:58:07,773 --> 00:58:09,453
You know I am artist.

556
00:58:09,724 --> 00:58:11,746
I would much rather
paint my impression.

557
00:58:13,591 --> 00:58:15,407
Well, something must have stuck you.

558
00:58:15,761 --> 00:58:18,603
Which you could not only
just paint but talk about also.

559
00:58:20,425 --> 00:58:24,928
Well, you know.
I arrive very early in the morning.

560
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,771
It's strange between darkness in Mumbai.

561
00:58:31,158 --> 00:58:32,786
The color of the sky.

562
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:36,331
It was so beautiful.

563
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,760
Try this.

564
00:58:40,992 --> 00:58:42,174
That's a beautiful.

565
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:50,617
Come in Sir.

566
00:58:50,659 --> 00:58:53,102
How are you Hari?
- what a pleasant surprise.

567
00:58:53,144 --> 00:58:53,989
Where were you for so many days?

568
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,544
I'd gone to Calcutta. How's your life?
How are you?

569
00:58:57,637 --> 00:58:59,489
Fine. As usual. Getting fat.

570
00:59:00,061 --> 00:59:01,887
Let me introduce you to my guests.

571
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:04,248
This is Dr. Collin, Mr. Mukherjee.
- Hello.

572
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:06,724
Mr. Mukherjee.
- Hello.

573
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,551
And this is Moshe Aundre.

574
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,529
Nice to meet you. How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

575
00:59:11,571 --> 00:59:13,880
He is Mr. Subir Sen.
One of our finest singer.

576
00:59:13,973 --> 00:59:15,734
I see Indian singer.

577
00:59:16,243 --> 00:59:17,207
I see.

578
00:59:17,764 --> 00:59:21,780
You see, one of my favorite
songs from Tagore.

579
00:59:22,212 --> 00:59:23,717
Do you know any of the day?

580
00:59:24,279 --> 00:59:26,498
Yes I know some of them.
- Really.

581
00:59:26,899 --> 00:59:28,466
Then please ask him to sing for us.

582
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:29,823
Yes, please start.

583
00:59:30,825 --> 00:59:33,978
But without harmonium.
Bring the harmonium for me.

584
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:34,601
One moment.

585
00:59:34,643 --> 00:59:36,807
Hari.
- Coming.

586
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:42,113
Go bring the harmonium from
our neighbour Mr. Jarrivala.

587
00:59:42,516 --> 00:59:43,210
Go.

588
00:59:43,803 --> 00:59:44,944
Oh, okay.

589
00:59:48,229 --> 00:59:51,549
Hello, how are you?
- Hello, how are you?

590
00:59:51,661 --> 00:59:53,254
When did you come?
- I came just day before yesterday.

591
00:59:53,613 --> 00:59:55,740
Should I bring drink for you?
- Oh, please.

592
00:59:57,565 --> 00:59:59,608
Well you see this Mr. Mukherjee..

593
00:59:59,686 --> 01:00:01,740
..he is wonderful..

594
01:00:01,782 --> 01:00:05,130
We cannot called is the musical spot,
we cannot called is the dramatic spot.

595
01:00:05,885 --> 01:00:07,234
Well, it's a spot..

596
01:00:21,287 --> 01:00:27,554
"That day both of us were swinging
in the sky together."

597
01:00:27,997 --> 01:00:32,490
"There were no restrictions
for us that day."

598
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:40,142
"Why do you come to my mind
every now and then."

599
01:00:40,189 --> 01:00:47,604
"Why don't you forget me?"

600
01:00:49,094 --> 01:00:55,071
"That day both of us were swinging
in the sky together."

601
01:00:55,466 --> 01:01:00,374
"There were no restrictions
for us that day."

602
01:01:01,149 --> 01:01:07,375
"Do you know you were
the wind that day."

603
01:01:07,605 --> 01:01:13,291
"I remember every moment of that day."

604
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:19,673
"Do you know you were
the wind that day."

605
01:01:19,949 --> 01:01:25,833
"I remember every moment of that day."

606
01:01:25,896 --> 01:01:35,574
"Looking up at the skies..
Doesn't bring a smile to your face?"

607
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:41,015
"Why don't you forget me?"

608
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:48,818
"That day both of us were
swinging in the sky together."

609
01:01:49,162 --> 01:01:53,728
"There were no restrictions
for us that day."

610
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:12,708
"On the way,
the moon had set foot in the sky."

611
01:02:13,547 --> 01:02:19,845
"We both saw each other, and.."

612
01:02:20,495 --> 01:02:22,974
Why did you serve it on the table?

613
01:02:23,497 --> 01:02:26,290
We were going to serve according
to the Indian tradition.

614
01:02:26,332 --> 01:02:30,315
I know. But he's worn tight trousers.

615
01:02:30,429 --> 01:02:32,747
The way he's drinking,
he'll out.

616
01:02:33,063 --> 01:02:35,625
Let it be this way. Go call him.

617
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:40,701
I insist.
- I insist.

618
01:02:43,663 --> 01:02:46,070
Why not you try this?
- Okay.

619
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:47,332
Please.

620
01:02:47,469 --> 01:02:48,512
It's delicious.

621
01:02:48,554 --> 01:02:49,418
Really?

622
01:02:52,225 --> 01:02:53,783
Take some more.
- No, thanks.

623
01:02:54,725 --> 01:02:57,299
How about this?
- No, no. It's enough for me.

624
01:02:58,577 --> 01:02:59,842
Try to this.

625
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:00,752
Okay.

626
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:02,008
You insist.
- I insist.

627
01:03:03,223 --> 01:03:04,740
Thank you very much.

628
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,493
Good night.
- Good night.

629
01:03:44,575 --> 01:03:47,065
Yes? Send him in.

630
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:03,591
May I come in, sir?
- Yes, please come in.

631
01:04:07,352 --> 01:04:10,020
Have a sit.
- Thank you sir.

632
01:04:15,943 --> 01:04:18,537
Mr. Sharma, you are very lucky man.

633
01:04:20,197 --> 01:04:21,629
Let you tell you Mr. Sharma.

634
01:04:21,926 --> 01:04:25,299
I'd got 52 applications for this job.

635
01:04:25,925 --> 01:04:29,671
There was only one applicant
who didn't ask for favours.

636
01:04:30,165 --> 01:04:30,980
Due to this..

637
01:04:31,022 --> 01:04:32,243
Not due to this.

638
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:35,966
I read your application,
saw the cuttings.

639
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:41,921
Took your interview. And then I got to
know that you don't need any favour.

640
01:04:42,613 --> 01:04:45,218
So I am very happy to give you the job.

641
01:04:47,005 --> 01:04:51,608
But even you asked for the favour?

642
01:04:52,193 --> 01:04:54,389
Actually..

643
01:04:54,431 --> 01:04:57,001
Don't worry. You are very lucky.

644
01:04:57,606 --> 01:05:01,832
You asked for favour,
and got the job without the favour.

645
01:05:02,922 --> 01:05:05,454
After coming to this city, I thought..

646
01:05:05,649 --> 01:05:09,604
That you need favour
with the capabilities.

647
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:13,112
Let you tell you one thing.

648
01:05:14,704 --> 01:05:20,542
If I wanted to give this job as
a favour then I wouldn't be happy.

649
01:05:21,365 --> 01:05:24,095
I would try hard to see you happy, Sir.

650
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:26,026
Is it?

651
01:05:26,592 --> 01:05:27,972
Can you speak the dialogues too.

652
01:05:28,193 --> 01:05:29,458
Oh, sir.

653
01:05:29,952 --> 01:05:32,892
Anyway.. come I'll show you the press.

654
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:36,176
This is one of the most modern
press in the country.

655
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,285
Good.
- Thank you sir.

656
01:07:40,908 --> 01:07:43,105
Do you like Brecht?
- Isn't it, great?

657
01:07:43,394 --> 01:07:45,350
I've read all his plays.

658
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,453
I watched 2 plays
when I'd been to Europe.

659
01:07:47,622 --> 01:07:48,928
Which ones sir?

660
01:07:49,463 --> 01:07:52,119
One was Marakerich,
and the other was..

661
01:07:52,197 --> 01:07:53,250
Kokatian..

662
01:07:57,482 --> 01:07:58,779
Yes. Speaking.

663
01:08:14,838 --> 01:08:16,448
Today also you're late.

664
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:20,142
Sorry.

665
01:08:20,274 --> 01:08:22,227
I left from the office very soon.

666
01:08:22,506 --> 01:08:24,420
I'm coming after dropping Shashi.

667
01:08:24,676 --> 01:08:26,171
I was there at his place.

668
01:08:26,339 --> 01:08:29,718
When I entered his room I remembered
my bachelor life.

669
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:32,303
Sorry.

670
01:08:43,662 --> 01:08:48,706
Did you read the mid dayer that
Shashi had written day before.

671
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,522
Everyone was talking about it today.

672
01:08:52,993 --> 01:08:55,734
I told you. He got a bright future.

673
01:08:56,916 --> 01:09:01,426
I've given him an assignment of
the tomorrow's editorial.

674
01:09:01,729 --> 01:09:04,805
And he's going to make
a great job out of it.

675
01:09:05,193 --> 01:09:08,436
Finally who's..

676
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:23,507
Did you wake up?
Take this tea.

677
01:09:23,549 --> 01:09:26,244
Read this.
Look how good he has written.

678
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:27,681
Read.

679
01:09:28,562 --> 01:09:29,786
So challenging.

680
01:09:30,819 --> 01:09:32,387
Drink the tea, it will get cold.

681
01:09:32,747 --> 01:09:34,630
I've never written like this myself.

682
01:09:36,202 --> 01:09:37,562
What a pride!

683
01:09:37,852 --> 01:09:39,034
Not of pride.

684
01:09:39,303 --> 01:09:41,321
After all Shashi is my discovery..

685
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,640
..and I am proud of him.

686
01:09:43,707 --> 01:09:45,391
Drink the tea, it will get cold.

687
01:09:47,881 --> 01:09:50,548
I forget him to congratulate.

688
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:55,644
Shashi, one minute.

689
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,805
Sir for the third page..
- Yes we'll have to plan again.

690
01:09:58,882 --> 01:10:02,321
You'll look after it.
I've some important meetings.

691
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:03,272
Right, sir.

692
01:10:04,905 --> 01:10:06,171
So really it's sad.

693
01:10:07,032 --> 01:10:07,952
Really?

694
01:10:13,387 --> 01:10:15,029
But you..

695
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:17,985
Oh, yes.

696
01:10:18,991 --> 01:10:21,702
But there is some limit
to our patience too.

697
01:10:21,932 --> 01:10:23,617
It's getting late.

698
01:10:24,632 --> 01:10:26,474
No, it's nothing like that.

699
01:10:27,197 --> 01:10:29,728
You are most welcome.
Certainly. Bye-bye.

700
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,406
You're so late. Who was it?

701
01:10:34,484 --> 01:10:36,196
Mrs. Mathur.
- Who?

702
01:10:36,439 --> 01:10:39,430
Your news editor.
- Okay. The same old thing?

703
01:10:40,133 --> 01:10:42,204
I don't understand.
Why don't you remove him?

704
01:10:42,665 --> 01:10:43,920
He has ruined her life.

705
01:10:43,998 --> 01:10:46,349
That's their issue.

706
01:10:46,538 --> 01:10:47,500
Why should I fall between them?

707
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:49,394
Moreover, who am I to get out of it.

708
01:10:49,624 --> 01:10:52,438
But still, he should be punished.

709
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:55,704
Mr. Mathur may not be totally wrong.

710
01:10:55,882 --> 01:10:58,989
And even if he is, by talking with us
the issue won't be resolved.

711
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,062
She must be telling me
this due to some purpose.

712
01:11:01,272 --> 01:11:03,081
Okay. Do it fast, Shashi's waiting.

713
01:11:03,159 --> 01:11:03,940
That Smita..

714
01:11:04,017 --> 01:11:06,399
I don't understand, why should he wait?

715
01:11:06,735 --> 01:11:08,116
Can't he go inside?

716
01:11:08,193 --> 01:11:10,261
Because our ticket is with him.

717
01:11:10,339 --> 01:11:13,118
Why is our ticket with him?

718
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,054
You want to fight?

719
01:11:15,725 --> 01:11:16,509
No.

720
01:11:18,383 --> 01:11:20,862
I want to watch the movie with you.

721
01:11:21,689 --> 01:11:23,687
Take your purse. Come here.

722
01:11:27,592 --> 01:11:29,673
Fine. Good.

723
01:11:31,276 --> 01:11:33,766
Did you like yesterday's movie?

724
01:11:33,966 --> 01:11:35,743
It was very good, Sir.

725
01:11:36,363 --> 01:11:38,538
Sorry we left in the middle.

726
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:41,092
Meeta was not well.
- I see.

727
01:11:41,773 --> 01:11:43,237
So I'll leave.
- Listen.

728
01:11:44,264 --> 01:11:46,032
We'll go together today.

729
01:11:47,413 --> 01:11:49,276
Complete your work till 6.

730
01:11:49,842 --> 01:11:50,752
Right, sir.

731
01:12:01,229 --> 01:12:04,953
Shashi, we'll have to understand
the problem between..

732
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:09,747
..Mysore and Maharashtra,
before writing about it.

733
01:12:10,606 --> 01:12:14,477
The problem is just as delicate as
the problem..

734
01:12:14,771 --> 01:12:16,915
..between husband and wife.

735
01:12:17,827 --> 01:12:21,802
This is right sir, but we'll have..
- Leave these problems.

736
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,352
Editorials etc.

737
01:12:23,614 --> 01:12:25,046
Leave the official matters in the office.

738
01:12:25,124 --> 01:12:26,396
We've stepped out,
it's 5.30 already.

739
01:12:26,474 --> 01:12:28,678
So no more office or business talks.

740
01:12:28,951 --> 01:12:29,912
Alright, sir.

741
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:12,970
What happened?
Why did you stop the car?

742
01:13:13,393 --> 01:13:16,793
Why did you stop singing?
- Do you like the song?

743
01:13:17,003 --> 01:13:18,970
Isn't it's a beautiful song?
- Yes.

744
01:13:20,175 --> 01:13:21,534
This is my favorite song.

745
01:13:21,839 --> 01:13:23,042
Really?

746
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:26,777
We have the same liking.
- Even I think so.

747
01:13:27,438 --> 01:13:30,408
If you say, may I gift you this record?

748
01:13:31,948 --> 01:13:34,699
I think, is this sung by Manna De?

749
01:13:34,909 --> 01:13:37,095
Yes.
- I must be having it.

750
01:13:37,861 --> 01:13:39,325
Yes it is there with me.

751
01:13:39,557 --> 01:13:43,438
You know Shashi I have 1000 records.

752
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,054
When I have the mood to listen
to a particular song..

753
01:13:46,132 --> 01:13:52,185
..then I have to first search it
when I find it after a great effort..

754
01:13:52,372 --> 01:13:56,274
..then I have to put it on
the record player.

755
01:13:57,168 --> 01:13:58,956
Switch it on.

756
01:13:59,502 --> 01:14:03,655
There is a irritating sound.
And then I can listen to the song.

757
01:14:03,733 --> 01:14:05,915
By that time, the mood to listen
to the song is totally lost.

758
01:14:07,737 --> 01:14:10,971
Hence when someone hums the tune
I love it.

759
01:14:11,515 --> 01:14:12,968
Naturally, sir.

760
01:14:13,472 --> 01:14:14,988
Why naturally?

761
01:14:15,283 --> 01:14:19,216
Yes. When Mrs. Sen herself sings so well..

762
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:20,816
Mrs. Sen..

763
01:14:23,287 --> 01:14:25,296
You mean my wife?

764
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:28,717
My wife?
- Yes.

765
01:14:30,947 --> 01:14:32,056
Mrs. Sen.

766
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,149
My wife.

767
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,545
She sings?

768
01:14:36,996 --> 01:14:37,864
She sings well!

769
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,599
Mrs. Sen.

770
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:45,294
Meeta.

771
01:14:45,954 --> 01:14:46,822
My wife.

772
01:14:47,753 --> 01:14:48,872
She sings?

773
01:14:49,972 --> 01:14:51,101
What?

774
01:14:55,214 --> 01:14:57,578
My wife? She is good singer?

775
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:00,258
Meeta is good singer?

776
01:15:15,025 --> 01:15:16,415
What the..

777
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,141
What is this nonsense?

778
01:15:20,218 --> 01:15:22,392
What?
- What the hell!

779
01:15:22,922 --> 01:15:24,332
But..
- But.. what?

780
01:15:24,997 --> 01:15:26,616
I am asking you what is going on?

781
01:15:27,841 --> 01:15:28,795
Tell me one thing.

782
01:15:29,211 --> 01:15:31,057
For how many years are we married now?

783
01:15:31,951 --> 01:15:33,185
For 6 years. Why?

784
01:15:33,263 --> 01:15:38,695
We're married for the past 6 years now.

785
01:15:39,436 --> 01:15:42,378
Till when are you going to hide
these things from me?

786
01:15:42,713 --> 01:15:43,262
What?

787
01:15:43,304 --> 01:15:45,021
Why did you hide this from me?

788
01:15:45,246 --> 01:15:46,614
What?
- What do you mean?

789
01:15:47,093 --> 01:15:51,482
Why did you hide this from me?
That you sing well.

790
01:15:54,648 --> 01:15:56,972
I got to know this from Shashi.

791
01:15:57,554 --> 01:15:59,691
Look he's gone.

792
01:16:00,304 --> 01:16:01,839
Stupid man.

793
01:16:06,344 --> 01:16:07,340
Alright.

794
01:16:07,454 --> 01:16:08,259
Now you tell me.

795
01:16:08,301 --> 01:16:10,698
What is all this nonsense?
- What?

796
01:16:10,776 --> 01:16:12,061
What do you mean?

797
01:16:13,619 --> 01:16:14,926
But..
- But what?

798
01:16:15,145 --> 01:16:16,887
Since how many years are we married?

799
01:16:18,362 --> 01:16:19,209
6 years.

800
01:16:19,287 --> 01:16:22,811
We're married for the past 6 years now.

801
01:16:23,165 --> 01:16:26,039
But still you don't know how to behave
with your wife in front of strangers?

802
01:16:26,117 --> 01:16:27,648
Okay.

803
01:16:29,008 --> 01:16:30,647
Is Shashi a stranger?

804
01:16:31,852 --> 01:16:32,961
Is Shashi a stranger?

805
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:35,109
I am stupid? Sing a song.

806
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:37,205
Go and wash your hands.
I'll make tea.

807
01:16:38,889 --> 01:16:40,766
First sing then the tea.

808
01:16:41,098 --> 01:16:42,197
Wash your face.

809
01:16:42,274 --> 01:16:44,169
Okay. One minute.

810
01:16:47,896 --> 01:16:49,131
Have this.

811
01:16:54,704 --> 01:16:57,630
Okay I am done, now sing.

812
01:16:57,859 --> 01:16:58,876
I will.

813
01:17:00,267 --> 01:17:02,434
Then what are you waiting for?

814
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:05,267
Sir will have his tea
while I sing for him.

815
01:17:05,884 --> 01:17:07,201
The what about mine tea?

816
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:09,577
Oh yes. You also drinking tea.

817
01:17:09,993 --> 01:17:11,269
Do it fast.

818
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:16,551
What happened?

819
01:17:17,248 --> 01:17:20,505
We both will have tea,
and someone else'll sing.

820
01:17:29,017 --> 01:17:30,459
We also have this song?

821
01:17:30,536 --> 01:17:32,690
It's a beautiful song.
- Of course it's beautiful.

822
01:17:33,117 --> 01:17:35,036
Shashi was going to present me this.

823
01:17:37,247 --> 01:17:41,958
And then I came to know
that even you sing well.

824
01:17:42,332 --> 01:17:43,971
Where did you listen to this?
- Shashi was singing.

825
01:17:44,978 --> 01:17:48,942
The only thing wrong was that
he has a very bad voice like me.

826
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:51,349
Hari.

827
01:17:51,516 --> 01:17:54,203
Hari.
- I think fuse is gone. I'll see sir.

828
01:17:54,281 --> 01:17:56,559
Tell me one thing.

829
01:17:57,007 --> 01:18:00,960
How did you feel
when Shashi told you I am sings well?

830
01:18:01,241 --> 01:18:03,087
Don't ask me.

831
01:18:03,441 --> 01:18:06,045
Had it been anybody else,
who knows what would've happened!

832
01:18:06,462 --> 01:18:10,497
I didn't think any further,
because it was Shashi.

833
01:18:12,055 --> 01:18:13,466
You didn't think anything else?

834
01:18:13,543 --> 01:18:14,804
What else will I think?

835
01:18:15,171 --> 01:18:16,830
I see.

836
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:20,172
I can't think about Shashi
the way you're asking me to.

837
01:18:20,411 --> 01:18:22,673
By the way Shashi after all our Shashi.

838
01:18:23,297 --> 01:18:25,434
The meaning of Shashi is moon, right?
- Yes.

839
01:18:26,016 --> 01:18:27,883
It also is blemished right?

840
01:18:30,054 --> 01:18:34,110
It is his half name.

841
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,098
Those who just know him think that way.

842
01:18:40,836 --> 01:18:43,389
But I know Shashibhushan.

843
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,340
Do you know the meaning?

844
01:18:46,119 --> 01:18:47,124
Lord Shiva.

845
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:49,398
I know.
- What?

846
01:18:49,907 --> 01:18:52,989
That he's now become Amarbhushan.

847
01:18:53,218 --> 01:18:56,694
Come here. Who's this Amarbhushan?

848
01:19:39,839 --> 01:19:47,279
"My beloved, don't call me as your life."

849
01:19:48,286 --> 01:19:52,405
"My beloved."

850
01:19:53,881 --> 01:19:58,944
"My beloved, don't call me as your life."

851
01:19:59,338 --> 01:20:03,727
"My beloved."

852
01:20:13,756 --> 01:20:18,934
"Don't call me your life
even unknowingly as.."

853
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:24,578
"..life doesn't remain forever."

854
01:20:25,097 --> 01:20:29,549
"Don't call me your life
even unknowingly as.."

855
01:20:30,131 --> 01:20:35,019
"..life doesn't remain forever."

856
01:20:35,528 --> 01:20:45,469
"How do the strangers know
why one will go away knowingly."

857
01:20:45,667 --> 01:20:53,398
"My beloved, don't call me as your life."

858
01:20:53,711 --> 01:20:57,788
"My beloved."

859
01:21:07,897 --> 01:21:18,855
"It has rained so many times
from these eyes."

860
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:29,264
"It has rained so many times
from these eyes."

861
01:21:29,587 --> 01:21:39,528
"But two drops didn't fall
from these wet eyelids."

862
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:47,239
"My beloved, don't call me as your life."

863
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:52,366
"My beloved."

864
01:22:02,247 --> 01:22:13,091
"When the lips touch even
our breaths also write words."

865
01:22:13,403 --> 01:22:23,168
"When the lips touch even
our breaths also write words."

866
01:22:23,595 --> 01:22:33,308
"So tell me those words from your eyes."

867
01:22:33,386 --> 01:22:40,718
"My beloved, don't call me as your life."

868
01:22:41,217 --> 01:22:45,222
"My beloved."

869
01:22:46,582 --> 01:22:51,033
"My beloved, don't call me as your life."

870
01:22:51,846 --> 01:22:56,381
"My beloved."

871
01:23:17,356 --> 01:23:19,046
Nothing much.

872
01:23:21,517 --> 01:23:24,215
But Mr. Sen how did you get wet?

873
01:23:24,476 --> 01:23:25,980
It rained at night.

874
01:23:26,614 --> 01:23:28,461
Had you gone out?

875
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:31,137
No, doctor.

876
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:33,566
Actually..

877
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:39,453
Bring tea for the doctor.
- Okay.

878
01:23:42,223 --> 01:23:44,796
So then you got wet in this room?

879
01:23:47,661 --> 01:23:49,383
You can assume so, doctor.

880
01:23:49,945 --> 01:23:57,364
Actually in the rain we both..
You tell him.

881
01:23:58,008 --> 01:24:00,290
Stop it.
- Why should I stop?

882
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:08,250
In the rains there was
a filmy scene yesterday!

883
01:24:09,414 --> 01:24:10,647
You understand.

884
01:24:12,165 --> 01:24:13,398
Doctor.
- Yes.

885
01:24:13,576 --> 01:24:16,357
But you can cure him
without knowing the reason!

886
01:24:16,596 --> 01:24:21,816
It's much better to treat him
after knowing the reason.

887
01:24:22,034 --> 01:24:22,947
Isn't it?

888
01:24:24,204 --> 01:24:28,738
It's good. I've always come here
for lunch or dinner..

889
01:24:29,174 --> 01:24:30,627
..for a change it's good.

890
01:24:30,805 --> 01:24:35,049
Cure me fast.
I'll call you for dinner again.

891
01:24:35,182 --> 01:24:36,225
It may be flu.

892
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:38,991
Take the medicine
and get cured in 7 to 8 days.

893
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:41,742
It's too long.

894
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:45,644
Ok. then don't take the medicine
and get cured in one week.

895
01:24:49,473 --> 01:24:51,434
Go and see who is it.
- Hari is there.

896
01:24:56,729 --> 01:24:59,634
No one's there except for the doctor.

897
01:25:01,441 --> 01:25:03,535
Sir, Shashi has come.

898
01:25:04,242 --> 01:25:09,014
Come in, Shashi.
Dr. Kohli, this is Shashi.

899
01:25:09,092 --> 01:25:09,959
Hello.

900
01:25:10,251 --> 01:25:11,557
He works with me.

901
01:25:11,807 --> 01:25:13,964
He's your future patient.

902
01:25:15,886 --> 01:25:18,946
But why future, even now..

903
01:25:19,024 --> 01:25:20,037
But, I am not patient now.

904
01:25:20,214 --> 01:25:24,810
I feel that you read till late at night.

905
01:25:25,257 --> 01:25:26,907
It's not good for health.

906
01:25:26,984 --> 01:25:28,690
Thanks for the suggestion, doctor.

907
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:31,742
Doctor, my work is such that I have to.

908
01:25:32,013 --> 01:25:34,668
How will it get over?

909
01:25:35,915 --> 01:25:39,328
Where are you going?
- To bring tea.

910
01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:47,475
If he asks,
tell that I'm in the bathroom.

911
01:26:03,468 --> 01:26:04,806
Daughter in law, Sir!

912
01:26:05,866 --> 01:26:07,920
What is this?
Why did you get up from the bed?

913
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:11,583
What are you cooking?

914
01:26:11,813 --> 01:26:14,687
Whatever. You'll get only syrup.

915
01:26:14,765 --> 01:26:18,703
Go away. I'll come.

916
01:26:36,202 --> 01:26:37,229
What are you searching?

917
01:27:05,449 --> 01:27:11,229
Don't you feel that there
are very few stars in the sky?

918
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:18,669
Yes. This city looks so marvelous
from the height.

919
01:27:19,646 --> 01:27:25,093
But what happens below everyone knows.

920
01:27:25,717 --> 01:27:30,315
How are you feeling today?
- Fine. Quite okay.

921
01:27:32,235 --> 01:27:33,573
Did you read today's news paper?

922
01:27:33,651 --> 01:27:36,488
I have. Sir the news..

923
01:27:36,566 --> 01:27:41,418
I don't understand why couldn't we cover
this important news?

924
01:27:42,612 --> 01:27:43,929
This is never done.

925
01:27:44,907 --> 01:27:47,957
I don't know what
has happened to Mr. Mathur?

926
01:27:51,196 --> 01:27:54,059
Do you remember last monday..

927
01:27:54,299 --> 01:27:55,938
It's very sad Sir.

928
01:27:56,395 --> 01:27:59,840
You may not be knowing that Mr. Mathur got
from his wife.

929
01:28:01,159 --> 01:28:03,763
What?
- May be they'll get a divorce.

930
01:28:07,594 --> 01:28:10,592
Strange. Both are smart.

931
01:28:11,226 --> 01:28:14,339
Both are good natured. All speak that.

932
01:28:15,762 --> 01:28:25,714
Still don't get this that
they are so good to their friends.

933
01:28:26,078 --> 01:28:28,931
Then why can't they be good
to each other.

934
01:28:32,161 --> 01:28:42,631
Sir, I think while meeting
with friends we make effort.

935
01:28:43,797 --> 01:28:47,968
The acquaintance changes
to friendship then it grows..

936
01:28:48,205 --> 01:28:49,543
It strengthens further.

937
01:28:49,804 --> 01:28:53,289
So there is a gradual change
in every relation.

938
01:28:54,183 --> 01:29:01,198
But the relation of husband
and wife is taken for granted.

939
01:29:02,215 --> 01:29:05,629
There is no effort
to develop this relation..

940
01:29:06,709 --> 01:29:19,422
..which results in a kind of feeling
of anger, anguish and emptiness.

941
01:29:20,482 --> 01:29:25,400
And no other option
is left but to get separated.

942
01:29:30,364 --> 01:29:34,868
Shashi, the girl you'll marry..

943
01:29:35,719 --> 01:29:38,904
..will be a lucky girl.

944
01:29:39,901 --> 01:29:41,800
When will you marry?
- I'll leave now.

945
01:29:41,963 --> 01:29:46,218
Don't. Have your dinner with us.
Meeta, Shashi will eat here.

946
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,759
Spare me today, I've to go out.

947
01:29:51,151 --> 01:29:54,502
Out? Who is she?

948
01:29:54,762 --> 01:29:58,186
Nothing like that,
and if so you'll know it.

949
01:30:04,216 --> 01:30:06,509
Drink this.
- No.

950
01:30:06,551 --> 01:30:09,733
Drink this darling.
- This is bitter.

951
01:30:10,837 --> 01:30:12,071
Drink it.

952
01:30:19,638 --> 01:30:20,934
Drink this water.

953
01:30:27,775 --> 01:30:29,496
Sit.
- I've lots of work to do.

954
01:30:29,574 --> 01:30:31,925
Sit.
- Let me go.

955
01:30:33,731 --> 01:30:36,065
Okay then let me hear the song,..
- Which one?

956
01:30:36,305 --> 01:30:38,494
That..

957
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:40,953
Now again somewhere,
the flower has bloomed.

958
01:30:42,065 --> 01:30:43,372
I'll sing right away.

959
01:31:07,244 --> 01:31:12,441
"Now again somewhere.."

960
01:31:23,717 --> 01:31:29,736
"Now again somewhere,
the flower has bloomed."

961
01:31:29,976 --> 01:31:34,644
"Don't call it love."

962
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:40,509
"Now again somewhere,
the flower has bloomed."

963
01:31:40,810 --> 01:31:45,905
"Don't call it love."

964
01:31:45,983 --> 01:31:51,437
"Now again somewhere
a lamp been lighted up."

965
01:31:51,645 --> 01:31:56,491
"Don't call it the destination."

966
01:31:56,533 --> 01:31:58,997
"Now again somewhere.."

967
01:32:18,815 --> 01:32:24,117
"The ocean of love is thirsty again."

968
01:32:24,346 --> 01:32:29,441
"Why does it seek blessings?"

969
01:32:29,693 --> 01:32:34,455
"The ocean of love is thirsty again."

970
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:39,778
"Why does it seek blessings?"

971
01:32:39,856 --> 01:32:45,622
"If the waves have come together."

972
01:32:46,048 --> 01:32:50,696
"Don't call it as a storm."

973
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:56,622
"Now again somewhere,
the flower has bloomed."

974
01:32:56,883 --> 01:33:01,645
"Don't call it love."

975
01:33:01,723 --> 01:33:04,417
"Now again somewhere.."

976
01:33:24,271 --> 01:33:35,209
"Why do people dream
which we have only created?"

977
01:33:35,287 --> 01:33:45,277
"Why do people dream
which we have only created?"

978
01:33:45,692 --> 01:33:56,537
"If the mind wanders
then don't call it love."

979
01:33:56,579 --> 01:34:02,490
"Now again somewhere,
the flower has bloomed."

980
01:34:02,744 --> 01:34:07,487
"Don't call it love."

981
01:34:07,565 --> 01:34:13,340
"Now again somewhere
a lamp been lighted up."

982
01:34:13,642 --> 01:34:18,364
"Don't call it the destination."

983
01:34:18,441 --> 01:34:21,270
"Now again somewhere.."

984
01:34:48,919 --> 01:34:50,760
This is correct. Give it.

985
01:34:51,278 --> 01:34:54,781
And give your article also in this.
- Okay.

986
01:34:55,259 --> 01:34:56,482
But that article is on the third page..

987
01:34:56,535 --> 01:34:59,211
Give it to Mr. Mathur,
he'll handle it.

988
01:35:00,231 --> 01:35:02,129
If there's any problem,
I'll manage.

989
01:35:02,411 --> 01:35:04,309
From tomorrow onwards
I'll come to the office.

990
01:35:04,601 --> 01:35:07,008
You should've taken some rest.
Work is going well.

991
01:35:07,714 --> 01:35:09,810
No. I'm alright.

992
01:35:10,474 --> 01:35:12,570
Actually since last two
days I don't have fever.

993
01:35:12,821 --> 01:35:14,574
I'm just on rest.

994
01:35:16,059 --> 01:35:17,210
What's the time?

995
01:35:17,677 --> 01:35:18,891
It's 8.30 now.

996
01:35:20,407 --> 01:35:22,804
I'll leave.
- No sit down.

997
01:35:23,115 --> 01:35:24,702
You're going home only.

998
01:35:26,011 --> 01:35:27,504
Do you have a matchstick?

999
01:35:29,373 --> 01:35:30,441
Here.

1000
01:35:37,905 --> 01:35:40,270
This is the last day of the sickness.

1001
01:35:40,541 --> 01:35:42,169
Office will start again tomorrow.

1002
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:47,409
Shashi,
these days went away so fast that..

1003
01:35:47,577 --> 01:35:49,070
..I was not even aware of it.

1004
01:35:49,778 --> 01:35:55,340
It felt as if.. Do you know
we are married for past 6 years..

1005
01:35:55,859 --> 01:36:02,334
..but I could've never known
her as I've in these 6 days.

1006
01:36:03,789 --> 01:36:08,914
Even if the person
grows old or modern..

1007
01:36:09,226 --> 01:36:13,699
..he turns into a child when he's ill.

1008
01:36:15,483 --> 01:36:19,280
That time he needs a motherly person.

1009
01:36:20,153 --> 01:36:25,974
And I knew Meeta as
a mother then a nurse..

1010
01:36:27,012 --> 01:36:31,267
..friend, lover and woman..

1011
01:36:34,184 --> 01:36:38,833
I never knew that a
wife can be so much more.

1012
01:36:40,899 --> 01:36:45,101
I think that a person should fall
sick as soon as he gets married.

1013
01:36:46,047 --> 01:36:48,318
Am I boring you?
- No sir.

1014
01:36:49,036 --> 01:36:58,406
Tell me one thing. A man can do all this
if he wants to know about a woman.

1015
01:36:59,155 --> 01:37:02,807
What does a woman do
if she wants to know about the man?

1016
01:37:05,372 --> 01:37:10,404
Shashi, you ask this to your wife
when you marry?

1017
01:37:11,121 --> 01:37:12,126
I'll leave.

1018
01:37:12,204 --> 01:37:14,182
Leaving?
- Yes, good night.

1019
01:37:22,308 --> 01:37:23,470
Listen..

1020
01:37:26,989 --> 01:37:28,908
Why do you stay for so long?

1021
01:37:30,642 --> 01:37:33,370
You are smart. Don't you know.

1022
01:37:33,798 --> 01:37:38,622
Remember you said that you are
content when you see me happy?

1023
01:38:12,188 --> 01:38:13,287
Naturally, sir.

1024
01:38:14,208 --> 01:38:15,702
Why naturally?

1025
01:38:16,001 --> 01:38:19,622
Yes. When Mrs. Sen herself
sings so well..

1026
01:38:20,511 --> 01:38:21,600
Mrs. Sen..

1027
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:26,332
You mean my wife?

1028
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:28,937
My wife?

1029
01:38:28,979 --> 01:38:30,199
You didn't think anything else?

1030
01:38:30,558 --> 01:38:31,802
What else will I think?

1031
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:33,743
I see.

1032
01:38:34,056 --> 01:38:37,302
I can't think about Shashi
the way you're asking me to.

1033
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:39,918
By the way Shashi after all our Shashi.

1034
01:38:40,366 --> 01:38:42,732
The meaning of Shashi is moon, right?
- Yes.

1035
01:38:43,033 --> 01:38:44,827
It also is blemished right?

1036
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:51,265
It is his half name.

1037
01:38:52,903 --> 01:38:57,188
Those who just know him think that way.

1038
01:38:57,873 --> 01:39:00,312
But I know Shashibhushan.

1039
01:39:00,645 --> 01:39:02,252
Do you know the meaning?

1040
01:39:03,072 --> 01:39:04,171
Lord Shiva.

1041
01:39:04,257 --> 01:39:06,504
I know.
- What?

1042
01:39:06,892 --> 01:39:09,942
That he's now become Amarbhushan.

1043
01:39:10,193 --> 01:39:14,146
Come here. Who's this Amarbhushan?

1044
01:40:29,457 --> 01:40:32,632
I won't have coffee,
I'm not going to the office.

1045
01:40:35,838 --> 01:40:37,851
Ask Shashi to come here.

1046
01:40:46,062 --> 01:40:47,575
Didn't you hear, what I just said to you?

1047
01:40:50,207 --> 01:40:52,562
I've given you the phone
call whomsoever you want.

1048
01:40:53,950 --> 01:41:00,000
Meeta, I didn't tell you to bring
the phone but to ring him.

1049
01:41:01,006 --> 01:41:02,416
Do you think that I haven't heard?

1050
01:41:03,103 --> 01:41:04,773
If you have,
then why don't you do it?

1051
01:41:07,006 --> 01:41:10,533
Listen,
Shashi is your assistant and I..

1052
01:41:11,736 --> 01:41:15,720
If you can't call him
due to your position..

1053
01:41:15,944 --> 01:41:17,281
Then I can't do it either.

1054
01:41:17,587 --> 01:41:19,465
I'm sending Hari.
He'll call for you.

1055
01:41:19,770 --> 01:41:22,261
Meeta, I want you to call him up.

1056
01:41:36,502 --> 01:41:37,569
Shashi here.

1057
01:41:37,647 --> 01:41:39,303
I'm calling from editor
Aman Sen's house.

1058
01:41:40,508 --> 01:41:42,064
You come over now itself.

1059
01:42:45,768 --> 01:42:48,258
Listen..
- Sir is in his room.

1060
01:43:12,721 --> 01:43:14,338
Are you ill again, sir?

1061
01:43:15,927 --> 01:43:18,199
No, it's nothing like that.

1062
01:43:29,399 --> 01:43:31,224
I had called you because,..

1063
01:43:34,319 --> 01:43:36,133
There certain things in life..

1064
01:43:37,281 --> 01:43:38,266
Sit down.

1065
01:43:47,730 --> 01:43:50,241
There's pain, a lot of pain.

1066
01:43:51,422 --> 01:43:53,445
It happens after the flu.

1067
01:43:55,179 --> 01:43:59,464
I don't know
it never happened like this before.

1068
01:44:02,941 --> 01:44:04,539
I was saying,..

1069
01:44:06,729 --> 01:44:11,793
I'd called you..
What's the time?

1070
01:44:13,196 --> 01:44:14,533
It's 9.15

1071
01:44:14,845 --> 01:44:15,664
9.15.

1072
01:44:18,271 --> 01:44:19,431
Phone ringing.

1073
01:44:22,899 --> 01:44:25,378
Hello. Wrong number.

1074
01:44:29,292 --> 01:44:31,315
Now a days there are too
many wrong numbers.

1075
01:44:35,675 --> 01:44:39,202
Shashi I'd called you..

1076
01:44:40,149 --> 01:44:42,690
That..

1077
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,783
Listen, come here.

1078
01:44:46,967 --> 01:44:49,634
I'm busy.
- Leave it and come here.

1079
01:44:54,782 --> 01:44:57,396
What happened?
- I said I'm busy!

1080
01:44:57,647 --> 01:44:59,264
To hell with your business.

1081
01:45:01,123 --> 01:45:02,865
Didn't you listen, Meeta?

1082
01:45:03,478 --> 01:45:04,847
Daughter in law, you go.

1083
01:45:05,076 --> 01:45:06,466
Can't you hear me? Damn it!

1084
01:45:07,484 --> 01:45:08,708
Can't you hear..

1085
01:45:19,949 --> 01:45:22,241
Okay, you can go now.

1086
01:45:36,803 --> 01:45:38,628
Should I leave now?

1087
01:45:40,374 --> 01:45:43,330
If you say I'll call you
after reaching office.

1088
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:45,603
It's already 9.30

1089
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:49,142
Okay.

1090
01:45:56,439 --> 01:45:57,642
Good day, sir.

1091
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:21,335
Who closed the door?

1092
01:46:22,685 --> 01:46:24,739
I asked, who closed the door?

1093
01:46:28,902 --> 01:46:30,821
Who closed the door?

1094
01:46:32,452 --> 01:46:35,741
Didn't you hear it, Meeta?
Who closed the door?

1095
01:46:37,931 --> 01:46:39,383
Why don't you answer?

1096
01:46:48,807 --> 01:46:50,321
What has happened to you?

1097
01:46:50,831 --> 01:46:52,573
That is what I want to know.

1098
01:46:53,394 --> 01:46:55,158
This is not the answer to my question!

1099
01:46:56,259 --> 01:46:57,544
Answer?

1100
01:46:58,158 --> 01:46:59,339
Answer to which question?

1101
01:46:59,417 --> 01:47:00,709
Didn't you listen?

1102
01:47:02,713 --> 01:47:06,562
Do you want to know
who closed the door?

1103
01:47:07,455 --> 01:47:08,928
Are you mad?

1104
01:47:10,527 --> 01:47:14,667
You had asked.
Who closed the door?

1105
01:47:17,999 --> 01:47:21,007
Why? Don't you want the answer?

1106
01:47:26,073 --> 01:47:27,578
How strange!

1107
01:47:28,927 --> 01:47:32,070
You want the answer
without asking a question.

1108
01:47:33,743 --> 01:47:39,948
You are also like those men
who want every answer..

1109
01:47:41,578 --> 01:47:43,249
..but don't want to answer any question.

1110
01:47:46,301 --> 01:47:48,157
You are a big editor.

1111
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:52,568
You teach administration
to the government.

1112
01:47:53,525 --> 01:47:55,714
Tell the teachers how to teach!

1113
01:47:57,438 --> 01:48:00,082
Teach the students how to learn.

1114
01:48:01,111 --> 01:48:02,968
Should they take part in politics or not?

1115
01:48:05,252 --> 01:48:10,357
You tell everyone what
to do and what not to do!

1116
01:48:13,369 --> 01:48:17,695
You have an editorial
for every problem in the world.

1117
01:48:19,429 --> 01:48:22,697
But do you have a editorial
for your own problem?

1118
01:48:23,664 --> 01:48:25,001
My problem?

1119
01:48:25,521 --> 01:48:27,358
Our problem?

1120
01:48:30,266 --> 01:48:32,787
A man chooses his own way..

1121
01:48:33,888 --> 01:48:38,630
..but a woman has to follow the way..

1122
01:48:39,845 --> 01:48:41,951
..which someone else has chosen for her!

1123
01:48:44,453 --> 01:48:51,832
I'm also one of those thousand girls
who walked the same way.

1124
01:48:53,847 --> 01:48:55,309
A tradition!

1125
01:48:56,837 --> 01:49:00,270
Which is made stronger
by every generation.

1126
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:07,546
After leaving my mother's womb
I wanted to walk.

1127
01:49:08,815 --> 01:49:12,373
But a hand came my way and said..

1128
01:49:13,235 --> 01:49:15,372
Come this way not that way.

1129
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:22,533
When I sat down to have food
I was told, eat this not that.

1130
01:49:24,619 --> 01:49:30,503
When I started learning
they told me, learn this not that.

1131
01:49:33,555 --> 01:49:35,765
I lost my mother when I was just 12.

1132
01:49:38,911 --> 01:49:45,365
After that 13, 14, 15, and then 16.

1133
01:49:46,903 --> 01:49:49,579
I didn't know how this years passed by.

1134
01:49:52,133 --> 01:49:56,740
And then suddenly
I found my new face.

1135
01:49:58,972 --> 01:50:03,278
I could feel that I'd grown young.

1136
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:11,425
But then no one told me what
I should do and what not to do.

1137
01:50:15,142 --> 01:50:18,400
A different kind of thirst was born in me.

1138
01:50:20,465 --> 01:50:22,259
I thought..

1139
01:50:26,503 --> 01:50:27,851
In those days..

1140
01:50:31,235 --> 01:50:33,092
I met Shashi!

1141
01:50:35,576 --> 01:50:37,475
We started meeting.

1142
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:42,851
Sometimes for a moment or two.

1143
01:50:44,563 --> 01:50:50,820
And I understood that this thirst
is turning into love.

1144
01:50:51,672 --> 01:50:52,969
And then..

1145
01:50:53,727 --> 01:50:56,207
..this decent society told me.

1146
01:50:58,097 --> 01:51:00,483
That we should hide our love.

1147
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:02,112
I agreed.

1148
01:51:03,245 --> 01:51:08,484
If we met in four months
then we used to chat.

1149
01:51:12,948 --> 01:51:19,341
If you calculate those few
moments it won't add to 6 hours.

1150
01:51:22,164 --> 01:51:25,546
But whatever Shashi gave me
in those 6 hours..

1151
01:51:28,059 --> 01:51:29,718
He didn't even touch me.

1152
01:51:31,338 --> 01:51:36,288
Still, whatever Shashi gave me
in those 6 hours..

1153
01:51:40,109 --> 01:51:44,051
You couldn't give that to me
in the married life of 6 years.

1154
01:51:46,605 --> 01:51:51,491
I used to get impatient to meet him.

1155
01:51:53,194 --> 01:52:00,739
I never felt so eager or
that impatience for you in these years.

1156
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:03,686
But why?

1157
01:52:06,936 --> 01:52:09,228
Because you gave me everything!

1158
01:52:09,727 --> 01:52:15,248
But you calmed my thirst.

1159
01:52:22,276 --> 01:52:23,675
Aman..

1160
01:52:47,505 --> 01:52:48,708
Hello.

1161
01:52:49,685 --> 01:52:50,763
Speaking.

1162
01:52:52,383 --> 01:52:54,582
Yes, I am fine.

1163
01:52:55,829 --> 01:52:57,717
I'll just come to the office.

1164
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:03,716
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1165
01:53:04,973 --> 01:53:07,743
7, 8, 9..

1166
01:53:07,931 --> 01:53:09,165
Good morning.
- Good morning.

1167
01:53:10,349 --> 01:53:11,770
Sir has called you.

1168
01:53:29,663 --> 01:53:30,628
Yes, sir.

1169
01:53:32,818 --> 01:53:34,343
What's the time?

1170
01:53:39,596 --> 01:53:41,172
I said what's the time?

1171
01:53:42,782 --> 01:53:44,556
I think, sir. Are you tense?

1172
01:53:45,024 --> 01:53:47,918
Yes I'm. And do you know why?

1173
01:53:50,493 --> 01:53:51,842
Do you!

1174
01:53:58,609 --> 01:54:03,579
If you were an ordinary man
I'd have told you the reason.

1175
01:54:05,542 --> 01:54:10,014
Everyone, somewhere in life
becomes an ordinary man.

1176
01:54:10,855 --> 01:54:13,957
This moment I'm an ordinary man
and I'm tense due to you.

1177
01:54:14,643 --> 01:54:18,139
I may not be a reason
but can be a excuse.

1178
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:21,159
Leave the differences between the
reason or an excuse let that be, it's you.

1179
01:54:22,302 --> 01:54:24,813
No sir. It's not me.

1180
01:54:27,211 --> 01:54:28,496
But..
- What?

1181
01:54:29,099 --> 01:54:32,213
I don't know what to say?
- Don't say anything.

1182
01:54:36,759 --> 01:54:37,900
Sign this.

1183
01:55:17,161 --> 01:55:18,281
Sit down.

1184
01:55:26,274 --> 01:55:28,079
Tell me one thing.

1185
01:55:29,605 --> 01:55:31,389
When did you write this resignation?

1186
01:55:31,857 --> 01:55:34,700
This morning.
After coming back from your place.

1187
01:55:36,205 --> 01:55:37,284
Why?

1188
01:55:38,562 --> 01:55:42,910
Sir I thought.

1189
01:55:43,959 --> 01:55:47,736
That I must be the reason
for your differences..

1190
01:55:48,297 --> 01:55:51,711
How can it be the reason for
the thing which doesn't exist.

1191
01:55:51,898 --> 01:55:54,015
I also didn't understand that..

1192
01:55:55,022 --> 01:55:58,633
How can the past interfere
with the present?

1193
01:56:12,292 --> 01:56:13,723
Go. Do your work.

1194
01:56:16,703 --> 01:56:17,999
Okay sit down.

1195
01:56:20,927 --> 01:56:23,043
Today I'll tell you a dialogue.

1196
01:56:24,517 --> 01:56:29,892
Past interferes with our present only..

1197
01:56:30,890 --> 01:56:34,854
..when we don't live
the present to the fullest.

1198
01:56:40,385 --> 01:56:42,948
Hari!
- Yes.

1199
01:56:43,861 --> 01:56:47,316
Call sir and ask him
when'll he come for lunch?

1200
01:56:47,394 --> 01:56:47,966
Okay.

1201
01:56:48,044 --> 01:56:49,911
Listen to me, Sir.
Now you should go home.

1202
01:56:50,597 --> 01:56:54,031
Why? Okay.

1203
01:56:55,631 --> 01:57:01,067
Shashi you are smart and sensitive.

1204
01:57:01,556 --> 01:57:03,828
But you're not yet married.

1205
01:57:04,110 --> 01:57:04,897
Sir.

1206
01:57:05,396 --> 01:57:06,879
You are still bachelor.

1207
01:57:07,814 --> 01:57:08,706
Go. Do your work.

1208
01:57:15,204 --> 01:57:22,167
Sir, madam is asking
when will you come for lunch?

1209
01:57:25,957 --> 01:57:27,346
Okay.

1210
01:57:57,901 --> 01:57:58,979
Hello.

1211
01:58:01,565 --> 01:58:02,882
Wrong number.

1212
01:58:14,050 --> 01:58:18,014
Why don't you call him
at the office and ask him?

1213
01:58:37,227 --> 01:58:38,284
If some..

1214
01:58:38,545 --> 01:58:42,674
Don't be worried, he'll come.

1215
01:58:43,453 --> 01:58:45,674
He must have some work.

1216
01:58:46,795 --> 01:58:47,998
He'll come.

1217
01:59:06,504 --> 01:59:07,592
Good night.
- Good night.

1218
01:59:07,905 --> 01:59:08,901
It's quite late, Sir.

1219
01:59:08,979 --> 01:59:10,707
Come with me to my house.

1220
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:11,553
Sir..

1221
01:59:11,631 --> 01:59:14,017
Yes, come with me.
We will have dinner together.

1222
01:59:14,424 --> 01:59:17,059
No. Both of you have together.
Spare me today.

1223
01:59:17,137 --> 01:59:18,989
Why some other time?
Why not now?

1224
01:59:42,249 --> 01:59:44,107
Drop me here.

1225
01:59:44,907 --> 01:59:47,313
Are you going to watch a movie?
- Yes sir.

1226
01:59:48,247 --> 01:59:49,389
Which movie?

1227
01:59:49,742 --> 01:59:51,651
Whatever it is.
I just want to watch a movie.

1228
01:59:53,510 --> 01:59:55,117
Here.

1229
01:59:55,523 --> 01:59:57,846
Goodnight.
- Goodnight. We'll meet tomorrow.

1230
02:00:15,076 --> 02:00:17,026
Hari, come let's teach your sir a lesson.

1231
02:00:17,104 --> 02:00:18,832
Has he come.
- Yes he has.

1232
02:00:19,165 --> 02:00:20,513
You troubled me all day..

1233
02:00:20,591 --> 02:00:26,532
Sit outside as if some accident
has taken place.

1234
02:00:26,610 --> 02:00:29,574
Don't speak anything.
If he asks you just..

1235
02:00:29,651 --> 02:00:35,416
..look at down, got it?
Hari, go now. Go.

1236
02:01:33,438 --> 02:01:34,859
What's this joke?

1237
02:01:35,057 --> 02:01:36,177
When will you leave this childishness.

1238
02:01:36,255 --> 02:01:38,491
Let's go and eat out. I'm hungry.

1239
02:01:38,569 --> 02:01:40,390
Be serious at least sometimes.

1240
02:01:40,468 --> 02:01:42,030
After eating the food.
- Then go and eat.

1241
02:01:42,108 --> 02:01:42,995
Come.

1242
02:01:43,537 --> 02:01:44,843
You go, you are hungry!

1243
02:01:44,921 --> 02:01:46,234
Not you?
- No.

1244
02:01:46,484 --> 02:01:49,275
Oh god! Now a days we both
don't feel hungry at the same time.

1245
02:01:49,878 --> 02:01:51,932
Please come.
- I am not hungry.

1246
02:01:53,272 --> 02:01:56,022
Okay, harass me as much as you want.

1247
02:01:56,541 --> 02:01:58,014
What did you say?

1248
02:01:58,284 --> 02:01:59,737
I harass you.
- Yes.

1249
02:01:59,966 --> 02:02:02,062
Do you remember what
did you say this morning?

1250
02:02:02,519 --> 02:02:05,466
So you only remember what I said
this morning?

1251
02:02:05,654 --> 02:02:07,916
Why don't you understand?

1252
02:02:09,111 --> 02:02:11,123
You only know how
to complain..

1253
02:02:11,944 --> 02:02:16,095
Do you know,
how much responsibility is on me?

1254
02:02:16,417 --> 02:02:23,598
Do you know what
I've to do to be on this position?

1255
02:02:23,972 --> 02:02:27,489
Do you have any idea what
a creative person has to do to be here?

1256
02:02:28,798 --> 02:02:31,319
This only a creative person will know!
- Yes.

1257
02:02:31,397 --> 02:02:34,360
Creativity will be known to
a creative person, no one else.

1258
02:02:34,438 --> 02:02:35,813
Not even you.

1259
02:02:36,748 --> 02:02:42,019
Now a days the most important thing
for a creative person is his job..

1260
02:02:42,218 --> 02:02:45,839
..his competition is with
no one else but himself.

1261
02:02:46,411 --> 02:02:49,461
Today's work should be better
than yesterday's and..

1262
02:02:49,539 --> 02:02:51,454
..tomorrow's work should be
better than today's.

1263
02:02:51,532 --> 02:02:53,966
Every day it should be better and better.

1264
02:02:54,153 --> 02:02:57,723
Only then can he reach
where he aims to reach.

1265
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,570
Where?
- On your head.

1266
02:03:00,048 --> 02:03:03,482
Okay, reach wherever you want to reach..

1267
02:03:03,649 --> 02:03:06,107
..but reach the dining table first.

1268
02:03:06,285 --> 02:03:08,743
Change your clothes wash
the hands and come.

1269
02:03:09,098 --> 02:03:11,660
Hari, serve the dinner.

1270
02:03:12,584 --> 02:03:14,026
Yes, I'm doing the same,
daughter in law.

1271
02:03:18,552 --> 02:03:22,038
Leave this to me and serve the dinner.
Go fast.

1272
02:03:39,495 --> 02:03:41,259
But, Meeta..

1273
02:03:41,488 --> 02:03:43,448
First sit down.
Eat the food and then we'll talk.

1274
02:03:43,709 --> 02:03:44,704
Sit down.

1275
02:04:05,420 --> 02:04:07,650
Whenever I want to speak...

1276
02:04:07,870 --> 02:04:10,681
Eat first.
We can talk for the whole night.

1277
02:04:12,758 --> 02:04:15,870
Where is my Roti?
- Hari, bring Rotis for him.

1278
02:04:16,349 --> 02:04:18,507
It's been so many years, don't you
know that bread is served first.

1279
02:04:19,317 --> 02:04:20,946
Careful. Roti is hot.

1280
02:04:21,154 --> 02:04:22,689
Wait I will give you.

1281
02:04:33,524 --> 02:04:35,350
Again you started thinking.

1282
02:04:35,517 --> 02:04:37,343
At least eat properly.

1283
02:04:47,089 --> 02:04:48,281
Whenever I want to speak..

1284
02:04:48,359 --> 02:04:50,222
First.. Have this water.

1285
02:04:52,590 --> 02:04:54,218
Drink some more.
- Enough.

1286
02:04:54,295 --> 02:04:55,630
Please.
- It's enough.

1287
02:04:58,328 --> 02:04:59,501
What are you doing?

1288
02:05:09,059 --> 02:05:10,283
It's enough.

1289
02:05:18,347 --> 02:05:20,120
What's this?
You didn't eat to your fill.

1290
02:05:20,297 --> 02:05:21,853
How do you know
if I haven't had my fill?

1291
02:05:22,145 --> 02:05:23,680
Okay. Give it to me
I will wash your hand.

1292
02:05:40,234 --> 02:05:43,576
So much anger.
Yes, see your face in the mirror.

1293
02:05:43,805 --> 02:05:45,537
You seem pale.

1294
02:05:46,027 --> 02:05:49,056
If I was the doctor,
I wouldn't have let you go to the office.

1295
02:05:49,223 --> 02:05:52,024
You take a rest. Sleep then.
We'll talk in the morning.

1296
02:05:52,203 --> 02:05:53,924
No, we'll talk now.

1297
02:05:54,319 --> 02:05:57,381
Let it be if I'm sick. I can think
much better than you..

1298
02:05:57,459 --> 02:05:58,678
..and know much better than you can.

1299
02:05:58,756 --> 02:06:00,234
And I want to let you know the same.

1300
02:06:00,312 --> 02:06:02,953
Did you get it?
- Okay. I got it.

1301
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:05,060
You were trying to tell this
for so long?

1302
02:06:05,703 --> 02:06:06,529
It's so simple!

1303
02:06:06,607 --> 02:06:09,335
I don't understand why you
don't want to listen to me?

1304
02:06:09,761 --> 02:06:14,503
Aman, If I say that I've understood
whatever you said..

1305
02:06:14,753 --> 02:06:18,458
I see, I've not even said it
and you got to know it.

1306
02:06:18,728 --> 02:06:20,430
Since when you become so smart?

1307
02:06:20,597 --> 02:06:21,882
It is the miracle.

1308
02:06:22,060 --> 02:06:23,719
Meeta.
- Yes Sir.

1309
02:06:27,062 --> 02:06:32,655
Till the time I don't finish it
you'll sit mum and listen to me.

1310
02:06:32,874 --> 02:06:34,772
Why are you spoiling your mood?

1311
02:06:35,157 --> 02:06:36,506
I've understood everything.

1312
02:06:36,787 --> 02:06:38,353
What?
- Everything.

1313
02:06:38,541 --> 02:06:41,176
What everything?
- The same thing that you want to tell me.

1314
02:06:42,058 --> 02:06:43,397
What am I telling you?

1315
02:06:44,156 --> 02:06:49,085
Don't you think we're talking too much?

1316
02:06:49,282 --> 02:06:51,585
Yes, due to your nonsense.

1317
02:06:51,752 --> 02:06:53,329
Okay. No more nonsense.
Promise.

1318
02:06:53,527 --> 02:06:55,903
Go to sleep now. I'll sleep now.

1319
02:06:56,070 --> 02:06:56,982
Why did you put off the light?

1320
02:06:57,222 --> 02:06:58,103
Put on.

1321
02:06:59,847 --> 02:07:02,286
What is the relation of the light?

1322
02:07:02,494 --> 02:07:03,749
We can talk in the dark.

1323
02:07:03,826 --> 02:07:06,176
No. We can't talk in the dark.

1324
02:07:06,478 --> 02:07:08,304
Say, what have you understood?

1325
02:07:08,678 --> 02:07:10,566
Didn't I say 'everything'?

1326
02:07:10,796 --> 02:07:13,285
Is this an answer?
- What?

1327
02:07:13,816 --> 02:07:15,050
Do you say
this can't be the answer!

1328
02:07:15,258 --> 02:07:18,277
I've never spoken anything better.

1329
02:07:18,355 --> 02:07:20,156
And you are saying that...
- Meeta.

1330
02:07:22,295 --> 02:07:23,478
Okay.

1331
02:07:27,277 --> 02:07:32,112
Aman, I've understood that
you have understood.

1332
02:07:33,483 --> 02:07:34,405
What?

1333
02:07:35,071 --> 02:07:38,649
I told you that I understood
that you have understood.

1334
02:07:39,034 --> 02:07:40,694
Have you understood?

1335
02:08:41,648 --> 02:08:44,719
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1336
02:08:46,267 --> 02:08:47,843
Again arguing.

1337
02:08:48,062 --> 02:08:50,531
Now tell me, boy or girl.

1338
02:08:53,667 --> 02:08:54,693
Both.

1339
02:08:55,831 --> 02:08:56,748
God promise.

1340
02:08:57,621 --> 02:08:58,740
Only one at a time.

1341
02:08:59,188 --> 02:09:02,964
It's 11.30 at night now.

1342
02:09:03,847 --> 02:09:06,555
This is the end of our last programme.

1343
02:09:07,464 --> 02:09:12,445
We will be here at your service
again tomorrow morning at 6:55.

1344
02:09:12,835 --> 02:09:16,010
See you until then,
Jai Hind (Hail India)!
