1
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,875
This story is now about to end.

2
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Though not as we imagined.

3
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,000
But we got to do what we got to do.

4
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,750
You're with me, right?

5
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,166
I knew you would say that.

6
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,125
I love you.

7
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,625
Who are you talking to, you freak?

8
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:19,416
Shut the fuck up!

9
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,250
Help! Anyone there?

10
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,875
Help! This psycho is trying to kill me.

11
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,791
Trying to scare me with your psycho stare?

12
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,041
I can do better. Here.

13
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,583
What do you plan to do with that?
File my nails?

14
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,208
One more word...

15
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,916
and I swear I'll kill you right now!

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,041
Then kill me!
That's better than this daily torture!

17
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,916
You haven't seen torture...

18
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,125
until I've shown you.

19
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,166
Wow!

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,083
It's only been an hour since I left home,
and I'm already missing you.

21
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,166
<i>Shona.</i>

22
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,250
<i>please, look at me.</i>

23
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,958
<i>Were you crying?</i>

24
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,041
<i>Don't lie.</i>

25
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:55,166
<i>I know you're upset
because I'm leaving you alone.</i>

26
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,208
I'm not upset.

27
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,375
<i>Why don't you just agree that
you're scared to be in the house alone?</i>

28
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,458
I'm...

29
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,041
not alone.

30
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,208
<i>What do you mean, not alone?</i>

31
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,166
Someone's spending the night over.

32
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,708
<i>Who?</i>

33
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,583
- You don't know him.
<i>- Him?</i>

34
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:22,541
<i>Listen, the flight
will start boarding in five minutes.</i>

35
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,833
<i>So if you're pulling my leg,
please stop it right now,</i>

36
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,541
<i>or I'll be miserable the entire flight.</i>

37
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,125
I'm not joking!

38
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,666
<i>What's his name?</i>

39
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,291
I don't know yet.

40
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,541
<i>What the fuck is wrong with you?</i>

41
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,375
<i>You're letting a stranger in the house?</i>

42
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,208
<i>And when you know
what's been happening in our town.</i>

43
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,416
<i>He could be dangerous.</i>

44
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,625
You want to meet him?

45
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,500
<i>He's already in the house?</i>

46
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,541
<i>He came as soon as I left?</i>

47
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,166
<i>You're talking as if
he was already in the house when I left.</i>

48
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,083
<i>What the heck!</i>

49
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,875
<i>- Where was he hiding?</i>
- You really want to know?

50
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,916
<i>Yes, god dammit, I want to know!</i>

51
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,458
Here.

52
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,916
He's been hiding here.

53
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,291
I've checked thrice.

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,208
It's positive. Surprise!

55
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,083
<i>Fuck it!</i>

56
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,583
Joy!

57
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,666
Joy, please come back.

58
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,750
Joy.

59
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,708
Please.

60
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:06,750
<i>So, you thought
only you've a flair for drama?</i>

61
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,750
<i>Congratulations, ma'am!</i>

62
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,333
<i>Thank you, guys.</i>

63
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:15,416
<i>I don't feel like leaving you
both, but what to do.</i>

64
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,333
Yeah, we understand. It's okay.

65
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,125
We both will be waiting for you.

66
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,625
- We love you.
<i>- Love you too.</i>

67
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,083
Mrs. Mukherjee.

68
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
May I come in?

69
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,291
My husband is not in.

70
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:54,958
I know.

71
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:56,958
That's why I'm here.

72
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,208
Don't worry.

73
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,125
I'm here on duty.

74
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,166
Regarding the missing girls' case.
Investigation is going on.

75
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,291
It's very late.
Please come at a decent time.

76
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,708
Now, get out!

77
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,041
It seems you didn't recognize me.

78
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,708
Inspector Imran Shahid.

79
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,708
Ah, nice place!

80
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,125
Don't worry.

81
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,750
There's nothing I can do to you now
that we haven't already done before.

82
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,291
What do you want?

83
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,958
What's the point of asking now?

84
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,416
I've made my drink.

85
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,333
If you've come for a drink,
please have it fast and leave.

86
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,708
I'm married now. People will talk!

87
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,750
I swear on you...

88
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,916
I'll leave as soon as I finish this drink.

89
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,125
Your promise.

90
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,083
Will it help, Sona...

91
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,958
if I swear on your baby?

92
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,500
So, this is where you sleep these days.

93
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,500
You must have heard
of the missing girls, Sona.

94
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,625
Yes.

95
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,583
- What do you know?
- That six girls are missing.

96
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,416
But why are you asking me all this?

97
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,833
Who else should I ask
about your husband's deeds?

98
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,083
That's enough. Get out of my house.

99
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,541
Look Sona, just help me nail him.
I promise you...

100
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,541
I'll not let you destroy my family!
Just get out!

101
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,416
You stole this from my house?

102
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,375
What are you up to?

103
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,458
Just want to verify something.

104
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,083
If you believe your husband,
you've nothing to worry about.

105
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,791
What... what?

106
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:33,958
Who's this kid?

107
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,958
My husband.

108
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,500
This is the doctor's property.

109
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,125
This is where Inspector asked me to come.

110
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,666
Sir!

111
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,125
Sir!

112
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,958
Sir!

113
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,791
Where's the Inspector?

114
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,083
What's the matter, sir?

115
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,625
Sir, we found nothing.

116
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,375
Sir, where are we going?

117
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,500
When you're too close
to the problem and can't find a solution,

118
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,958
go away and look at it
from a new perspective.

119
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,958
How many girls were missing?

120
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,416
Six.

121
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,791
We've found one. So how many remaining?

122
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,750
Five.

123
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,666
What do you see in fives around?

124
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,333
Five potted plants.

125
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,666
Let's dig under them.

126
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,958
Now, let's get that bastard.

127
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,041
Madam...

128
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,458
What?

129
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,291
We considered the doctor such a good man.

130
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,958
I don't want to work here anymore.

131
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,166
Hello?

132
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,291
- Doctor.
- Hello. How are you?

133
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,291
What is this?

134
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,416
Killer Dr. Death Monster Die!

135
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,583
You've got five minutes.

136
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,000
Only five minutes?

137
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,666
Yes. This is a special provision

138
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,750
as we couldn't bring
him out in regular visiting hours.

139
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,750
People are waiting to lynch him.

140
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,416
Please.

141
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,625
<i>Please don't cry, shona.</i>

142
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,416
<i>This is all a mistake.</i>

143
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,625
As soon as they realize their mistake,
they'll immediately let me go.

144
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,500
<i>What's bothering you, shona?</i>

145
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,708
You believe me, don't you?

146
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,791
Yes.

147
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,208
I believe you.

148
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,958
I know you're innocent.

149
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,041
You've been framed.

150
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,416
But who would want to frame me?

151
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,833
I'm just a doctor.

152
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,500
I don't even have any enemies.

153
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,583
I want to...

154
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,791
I went to the best lawyers in town.

155
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,750
No one is willing to take our case.

156
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,250
What do we do?

157
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,750
I've no clue.
I've never needed a lawyer before.

158
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,166
Then we are left with only one option.

159
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:08,583
Public defender.

160
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:09,666
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

161
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,000
There was this patient,

162
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,666
from Haldwani.

163
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,458
A very senior lawyer.

164
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,625
Mr. Rastogi.

165
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,125
I had once done him a favor.
He might help.

166
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,083
A criminal lawyer?

167
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:26,166
I don't know. But even if he isn't,
he should be able to recommend someone.

168
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,250
You'll find his number in my computer.

169
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,541
Time's up.

170
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,208
Which computer? Home or office?

171
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,291
Office, okay?

172
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,208
What's his full name?

173
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,916
I called him Mr. Rastogi.
That's all I remember.

174
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,666
Take care of yourself.

175
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:54,583
SONA MATERNITY HOME

176
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:09,500

ADVOCATE BRIJ RASTOGI
Criminal Lawyer

178
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,809
- I'm here to meet Mr. Rastogi.
- You've got an appointment?

179
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,958
- No. I tried calling...
- He's not meeting anyone.

180
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,166
- See, it's a matter of life and...
- Clear the gate.

181
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,166
Clear the gate.

182
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,125
Why don't you let me complete...

183
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,416
Now what's your problem?

184
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,625
Why can't anyone let me
complete one fucking sentence?

185
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,333
Listen, it's a matter of life and death.

186
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,541
Please convey to Mr. Rastogi.

187
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,375
Mrityunjoy Mukherjee's wife
is here to see him.

188
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,666
Dr. Mrityunjoy Mukherjee's wife?

189
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,250
Greetings, madam.

190
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,416
You know him?

191
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,791
Very well, actually.

192
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,583
I am Mrs. Rastogi.

193
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,708
- Nice to meet you.
- Come on.

194
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,250
Baby, Mrs. Mukherjee is here.

195
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,166
Where's my doctor?

196
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,583
In prison.

197
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,583
It's all over the news.

198
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,208
I thought you would be aware.

199
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,083
Since my cardiac arrest,

200
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,375
I've no idea
what's going on outside this room.

201
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,476
<i>The police have accused him
of being the serial killer</i>

202
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,958
<i>responsible for the murder
of six innocent unmarried pregnant women.</i>

203
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,750
<i>Each of the six missing girls
were found in the farm-house</i>

204
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,875
<i>of well-renowned gynecologist, Dr. Mri...</i>

205
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,416
<i>All the bodies were dismembered</i>

206
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,875
<i>and six fetuses
were also found in the basement of...</i>

207
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,166
<i>The city is in a complete state of shock.</i>

208
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,666
<i>And all the lawyers in the city</i>

209
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,291
<i>have decided to not take the case
of Dr. Mrityunjoy Mukherjee.</i>

210
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,125
Joy is innocent.

211
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,041
He didn't kill anyone.

212
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,750
I know.

213
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,833
My doctor couldn't kill a fly

214
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,416
if his life depended on it.

215
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,500
So you'll help us?

216
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,416
- Won't go to school today?
- Didn't feel like it.

217
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,666
Bad boy.

218
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,625
I'll have to be of help.

219
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,833
That's the least I can do
for him for giving me

220
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,833
this bundle of joy at my age.

221
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,416
I'll immediately put my team on the case.

222
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:09,875
But first things first,

223
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,458
we apply for bail.

224
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,666
But how will you go
to court in this condition?

225
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,041
If I can't go, we'll get the court here.

226
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Okay.

227
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,958
Death to Dr. Mukherjee!

228
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:33,208
Death to Dr. Mukherjee!

229
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:37,375
- Punish the guilty!
- Hang the killer!

230
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,458
- Punish the guilty!
- Hang the killer!

231
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:44,541
- Punish the guilty!
- Hang the killer!

232
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,416
S. TIWARI Judge

233
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,875
Defense, how does your client plead?

234
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,666
<i>Not guilty, Your Honor.</i>

235
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,541
<i>We plead not guilty and we move for bail.</i>

236
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,625
<i>Excuse me for appearing like this,
Your Honor.</i>

237
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,375
<i>But you're aware of my condition.</i>

238
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,666
<i>So I crave Your Honor's leave
to make an exception this one time.</i>

239
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,166
Wasn't expecting a normal entry
from you, Mr. Rastogi. You can carry on.

240
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,250
<i>Thank you, Your Honor.</i>

241
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,083
Prosecution?

242
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,541
Prosecution!

243
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,500
Yes, Your Honor.

244
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,916
Your Honor, actually...

245
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,875
We ask that the defendant
be remanded without bail.

246
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,458
<i>We object, Your Honor.</i>

247
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,583
<i>The defendant is a surgeon,</i>

248
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,125
<i>a respected member of the society.</i>

249
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,958
<i>His property was misused by someone.</i>

250
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,166
<i>There's no evidence
to suggest he's involved.</i>

251
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,250
There is, Your Honor.

252
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,791
Fingerprints from cigarette butts
found at the crime scene.

253
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,541
DNA from hair samples,
also found at the crime scene.

254
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,333
All match with the accused

255
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,875
and prove his involvement.

256
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,666
The bail application is rejected.

257
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,083
The defendant will remain
in custody without bail.

258
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,375
Sona.

259
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,291
Sona.

260
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:23,791
Doctor, you won't get away with this.

261
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:24,875
Beat him up!

262
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,375
Joy!

263
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,166
What do we do now?

264
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:37,958
I've gone through all the confidential
reports my team sourced.

265
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,250
All the evidence

266
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,125
points towards your husband.

267
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,500
All the victims
were single pregnant girls,

268
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:55,416
who were aborted before being killed,

269
00:23:56,291 --> 00:24:00,000
And their fetuses were kept as trophies.

270
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,916
This is something
only a gynecologist could do.

271
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,250
Are you also giving up on him?

272
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,416
Mrs. Mukherjee...

273
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,666
I'm a very expensive lawyer.

274
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:17,458
And expensive lawyers
are mostly defense attorneys.

275
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Because only the ones
who need defending can afford us.

276
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,333
Look.

277
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:31,708
I don't care
if your husband is guilty or not.

278
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:36,666
But I can be of help to him and you

279
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,416
only if I know the truth.

280
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,041
Believe me...

281
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,458
Joy is innocent.

282
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:45,791
Exactly this.

283
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:49,458
How can you be so sure?

284
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:54,208
Because I know who's guilty.

285
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,541
- Who?
- My ex-boyfriend.

286
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:01,000
This entire incident started
since he came to our town.

287
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,625
He's getting back at me.

288
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,541
The evidence he submitted in court today,
he had stolen from our house.

289
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,625
He has framed Joy!

290
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:12,708
He was in court?

291
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,250
He's the cop

292
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,791
who gave evidence to the prosecution.

293
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,125
Oh...

294
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:22,541
That explains it.

295
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:29,083
That explains how the evidence
was manipulated with such legal precision.

296
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,333
As for the abortions,
he could have paid any quack to do it.

297
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,458
But what do we do now?

298
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,041
Can you prove...

299
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:47,791
that this cop framed Dr. Mukherjee?

300
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,333
No.

301
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,875
Then technically, there's just one way.

302
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:03,583
- But practically, that's not for you.
- Why?

303
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:06,166
Because when legal options
are exhausted...

304
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:09,500
other options must be explored.

305
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:13,875
I don't understand.

306
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:18,791
Let's say, a witness is threatening
to send my client to prison.

307
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,541
Under such circumstance, I might suggest

308
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:30,041
if the witness disappears, it'll help.

309
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,541
Then it's up to them,

310
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:38,416
whether they want to take that path.

311
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,166
But...

312
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:43,708
that's illegal.

313
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,458
You'll be surprised

314
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:52,958
at what people will do
to save their loved ones from prison.

315
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:01,958
So what do you suggest for me?

316
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,083
This path is not for you.

317
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,958
This entire situation is because of me.

318
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,208
I'll do anything to set it right.

319
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:11,666
If you insist.

320
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:13,875
But remember...

321
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:16,791
you asked for it.

322
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:26,416
We must prove

323
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:30,208
that the serial killer is still out there.

324
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
How?

325
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,458
He must strike again.

326
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:42,125
But that won't happen.

327
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,166
His purpose is achieved.

328
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,875
If he doesn't,

329
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,583
then someone else must.

330
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:51,791
Who?

331
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,333
Whoever...

332
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:58,458
wants to get Dr. Mukherjee out of prison.

333
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:08,958
You mean...

334
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:11,791
me?

335
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:15,375
Forget it.

336
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:17,916
Forget that I even brought it up.

337
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:21,458
I warned, this is not for you.

338
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:24,958
But I promise you,

339
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:28,666
I won't let your husband
be sentenced to death.

340
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:35,291
Whatever it takes, I'll make sure
he only gets life imprisonment.

341
00:28:58,416 --> 00:28:59,625
What happened?

342
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Joy.

343
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:07,833
But a full barricade
should be here, okay?

344
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:10,375
Mrityunjoy Mukherjee? I'm his wife.

345
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,000
Oh, my God! How did this happen?

346
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,416
Some jail inmates attacked.

347
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:22,916
It was an attempt to murder.

348
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,541
Someone must have paid them to kill him.

349
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:28,375
But who?

350
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:32,416
In such cases, it's usually
the victim's family.

351
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:36,458
This time he survived,
but next time he won't.

352
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,458
<i>Hi, I'm Mrityunjoy.</i>

353
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:40,625
<i>I'm a gynecologist.</i>

354
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:44,000
<i>And a male gynecologist
is like a bald hair stylist.</i>

355
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:53,666
You like tattoos?

356
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,750
Yup.

357
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:01,708
I made this myself.

358
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:05,125
I'm a part-time tattoo artist.

359
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,250
If you ever want one, let me know.

360
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
No.

361
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:12,000
I don't like tattoos on my body.

362
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:13,916
Why?

363
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:15,791
What's wrong with tattoos?

364
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:16,875
Well...

365
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:19,541
why make graffiti...

366
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:22,375
on the Taj Mahal?

367
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,458
Listen, you're trying too hard.

368
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,833
But I'm sorry, I can't marry you.

369
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:33,708
Watch out!

370
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,458
Hey!

371
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:38,833
What?

372
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,541
You're in luck, bro.

373
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,916
I'm in a good mood.

374
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,041
I've just sent an asshole

375
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,458
to prison.

376
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:57,458
So letting you go off with a warning!

377
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,291
Warning!

378
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:07,375
If a cop is killed in a hit-and-run

379
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:10,458
will that prove
that the serial killer is still out?

380
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:13,416
<i>Of course not.</i>

381
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:17,541
<i>Serial murder means the victim
has to be of the same profile.</i>

382
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:21,375
<i>In our case, single pregnant girls.</i>

383
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,666
<i>And all killed in the same fashion.</i>

384
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,625
<i>In our case, after abortion.</i>

385
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,833
<i>But why do you ask?</i>

386
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:35,458
I'll do whatever it takes
to prove my husband innocent.

387
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,166
I'm on.

388
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:49,458
<i>My parents want to get me married.
They made me meet a guy.</i>

389
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:52,875
If you don't like him, tell them so.
They won't force you to marry anyone.

390
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:57,458
Yes.
But they won't let me marry you either.

391
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,125
Why, what's wrong with me?

392
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,833
Because they both are surgeons.

393
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:04,000
So they want me also
to marry a surgeon. And you...

394
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm sorry, but you're just a cop.

395
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,125
Hey! So what?

396
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:11,375
Ultimately, we both save lives.

397
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,458
Shut up.

398
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:15,000
Unless you do something now,
our relationship is over.

399
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,375
Sona, what do you want me to do?

400
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:19,208
Let's elope and get married.

401
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:20,250
Are you crazy?

402
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,791
You're your parents' only child.
They'll be heartbroken.

403
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:26,041
Don't make excuses!
You want to marry me or not?

404
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:29,375
I do, but it's too early, it's too sudden.
I need some time to think.

405
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,500
Time to think?

406
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:34,416
While we were dating for so many years,
you never thought even once?

407
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,083
Were you using me?

408
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,833
What do you mean, using you?

409
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,333
Are you a candle
that I used and diminished?

410
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,250
- Sick!
- Sona!

411
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,125
Where are we going?

412
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,083
You wanted to run away
and get married. Run!

413
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:00,416
MASS MARRIAGE CEREMONY

414
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:42,666
Oh, fuck!

415
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,583
Hello, Dr. Deepa Chauhan's clinic?

416
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:25,500
Sona Mukherjee. I need an appointment.

417
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,000
For tomorrow, please.

418
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:30,541
Today?

419
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,541
At 12 PM? Let me check.

420
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,208
I'm so sorry. I can't make it today.

421
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,958
Can you please try for tomorrow?

422
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:49,708
The day after tomorrow?

423
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:52,166
Yes, I'll take that.

424
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:05,958
Hi, I'm Sona Mukherjee.
I've a 12 o'clock with Dr. Deepa Chauhan.

425
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:08,958
Didn't you call this morning?

426
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:12,208
Yes. I wanted time for tomorrow,
but you asked me to come today.

427
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:13,865
Thank you. That was very sweet.

428
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:16,708
You're mistaken, ma'am.
You wanted an appointment for tomorrow,

429
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:19,125
I offered you today,
but you chose day after.

430
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,333
Here it is clearly written.

431
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,166
Oh, I see.

432
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:29,791
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

433
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,458
Can you please ask the doctor
if she can see me today?

434
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,041
Please. It's really important.

435
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:40,125
I'm sorry, ma'am.
She's attending the last patient.

436
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,958
Then she has to leave for a surgery.

437
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:48,625
I'm sure the doctor is smart enough
to make her own decisions.

438
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,416
She doesn't need you to make them for her.

439
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,500
So go inside, and ask her!

440
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,500
I'll just check, ma'am.

441
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:21,166
You can meet the doctor.

442
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:23,541
Fuck!

443
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:43,625
Hello, baby.

444
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:46,208
This is mommy.

445
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:53,041
From now on, I'll be discussing
with you about my plans to save daddy.

446
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:56,708
So I don't go mad all alone.

447
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:04,875
We've three pregnant women from our town.

448
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:08,666
But the one we're looking
for has to be single.

449
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,750
So...

450
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:13,458
let's hope,
at least one of them has been naughty.

451
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,416
- Hello?
- <i>Yes?</i>

452
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:27,041
May I speak to Richa Gupta?

453
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,833
<i>Speaking. Who's this?</i>

454
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:33,083

<i>Feb 20th. Where's this resort?</i>

458
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,625

459
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,625

460
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:55,958

461
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:59,583

00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:11,333
<i>But do I've to come with my husband,
or can I come with someone else?</i>

466
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:12,625
Bitch!

467
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:23,791
This is our last hope.

468
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:27,666
Please, God.

469
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:29,625
Hello?

470
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:30,958
<i>What's up?</i>

471
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,833
May I speak to Anushka Tiwari?

472
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:36,375

473
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:39,625

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,166
We're offering a free stay

475

May I please know,

476
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:47,375
<i>Are you serious?</i>

477
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:48,541
Yes, I'm serious.

478
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:51,208
<i>Listen dipshit, never call me again.</i>

479
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:54,291
<i>Or I'll tell my neighbor.
He's a serial killer.</i>

480
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,583
<i>He'll cut you to little pieces.</i>

481
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:02,386
How many more serial killers
are there in...

482
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,083
<i>- Anushka.
- Hi.</i>

483
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:07,267
<i>- Hi. I didn't see you in class last week.
- Hi.</i>

484
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,125
Anushka Tiwari.

485
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:11,875
My student.

486
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:15,000
<i>Okay students, so now let's note down
a normal pulse rate will be...</i>

487
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:16,625
My neighbor.

488
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:24,958
Why do all the conflicts
have to be in my story?

489
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:42,416
Anushka, child, don't be late
in the evening. Come home early.

490
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,791
Yes I know, mom. Bye!

491
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:33,708
Baby! What is it?

492
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:35,333
- Sid.
- What happened?

493
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:36,416
Sid, I...

494
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:42,125
You're pregnant? What?

495
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:44,708
Why didn't you tell me this before?

496
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,500
I just don't want to talk
to you anymore. Right?

497
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:51,708
Just fuck off!

498
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Shit. No!

499
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,250
Move!

500
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,916
Shit!

501
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:49,416
Asshole.

502
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:51,416
Are you okay?

503
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,333
Yeah.

504
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:54,666
- Are you okay? Relax.
- Yeah.

505
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:05,500
Why didn't you move?

506
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:13,333
Were you trying to kill yourself?

507
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:17,208
Ma'am, please don't tell anyone.

508
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:19,958
Don't worry.

509
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:23,125
I can't tell anyone.
No one talks to me anymore.

510
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,583
Ma'am, I owe you.

511
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:35,541
What?

512
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:37,833
My life.

513
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,375
You saved my life.

514
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,250
Don't worry,
I'll take it back later when I need it.

515
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:56,833
You're funny.

516
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:09,041
Thanks.

517
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:10,375
- Bye.
- See you, Ma'am.

518
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:25,458
Ready!

519
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,208
- Hey!
- Hey!

520
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:36,958
Now I'm convinced

521
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:39,916
you're not on my side.

522
00:43:58,958 --> 00:43:59,958
Taekwondo.

523
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,041
Madam.

524
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:31,333
Shanta?

525
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:35,166
Sorry, I got carried away
by what everyone were saying.

526
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:38,416
Please let me continue working for you.

527
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:40,875
I'll never...

528
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:43,500
Okay, go in and do your work. Go.

529
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:56,916
Doggy.

530
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:59,708
Doggy, look. Doggy.

531
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:02,958
Doggy, come. Yes. Come.

532
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:05,666
Get it.

533
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:07,833
Doggy eat. Eat, doggy.

534
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:12,583
Yummy. Eat. Come on.

535
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:17,375
Come. Eat, eat it. Yes, good doggy.

536
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:19,625
What happened?

537
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:21,041
Nothing, madam.

538
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:24,416
Shanta, don't touch
any bottle in the kitchen.

539
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,541
Okay, madam.

540
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,208
Shanta!

541
00:45:57,458 --> 00:46:00,750
Shanta, I had told you
not to touch any bottle in the kitchen.

542
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,083
Careful.

543
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,583
Someone is following me.

544
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:31,750
Did you see a black SUV at the corner?

545
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:36,541
Maybe he got scared on seeing you.

546
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:38,250
Yeah.

547
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:49,000
Sir, you're not getting late, right?

548
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,963
You don't mind waiting
for a few minutes, right?

549
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:01,375
Listen, don't worry, okay?
I'm a Taekwondo black belt.

550
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:03,916
If a fight breaks out, I'll save you.

551
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,166
What the fuck?

552
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:04,833
Why did she stop here?

553
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:07,750
Oh, fucking bitch!

554
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:37,166
Good morning, Angad.

555
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,041
Good morning, sir.

556
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:46,375
Sir, anything special today?

557
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,166
Absolutely.

558
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,500
I'm going to the headquarters
to ask for a transfer.

559
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,791
Are you leaving us, sir?

560
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,125
Are you upset with us?

561
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:59,333
No. It's just that I've achieved
the purpose I had come here for.

562
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,791
The missing girls' case?

563
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:03,166
But sir, you said,

564
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:06,583
you came here because you loved this town.

565
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:10,625
That too. But my primary objective
was solving the missing girls' case.

566
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:11,875
Okay, sir.

567
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:14,708
But sir, as far as I remember,

568
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:17,583
the girls started going missing
only after your posting here.

569
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:20,041
So how could you have...?

570
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:27,125
Sir.

571
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:32,333
Hello, police station.

572
00:52:34,291 --> 00:52:35,291
Yes.

573
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:42,166
Sir! Another girl is missing.

574
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,750
Shut up.

575
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:52,875
Yes.

576
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,250
No.

577
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Eat.

578
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:07,208
Sleep.

579
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:14,458
Serial killer.

580
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:19,125
I'll kill you.

581
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:25,000
Look, the Inspector has arrived.

582
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,833
Sir, the family is inside.

583
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:28,875
When did you last see her?

584
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,208
Yesterday evening,
while she was leaving for Taekwondo.

585
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,750
Don't worry, she must be
at a friend's place. She'll be back.

586
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,708
We've already checked
with all her friends.

587
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:44,291
And she's never stayed out before
without informing us.

588
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:47,625
What was the response
when you called her?

589
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:52,416
I called her last night
to ask what she wants for dinner.

590
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,833
Her phone kept ringing,
but she didn't pick up.

591
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,750
I tried again, many times.

592
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:58,958
But it's switched off.

593
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:03,291
SONA MATERNITY HOME

594
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Who's it?

595
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,250
<i>Serial killer.</i>

596
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:54,083
Why have you brought me here?
What do you want?

597
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:58,000
Are you gay?

598
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:00,291
Of course, you're gay.

599
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:02,208
You're wearing women's perfume.

600
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:06,041
You can't get pregnant,

601
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:09,416
so you're taking out
your frustration on those who can.

602
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:12,791
But how did you know I'm pregnant?

603
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:15,166
No one knows except the gynecologist.

604
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:19,458
Do you work there?

605
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:34,958
Eat.

606
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:36,875
Okay.

607
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:38,708
Release my hands.

608
00:55:48,666 --> 00:55:50,041
I'll kill you.

609
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,208
You cry like a woman.

610
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:02,208
Hello?

611
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:07,916
Hello? Are you there?

612
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:13,666
I'm hungry, I want to eat more.

613
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,875
I promise, I won't bite.

614
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:16,958
<i>Hello?</i>

615
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,375
- This doesn't look like her room.
- This is who she really is.

616
00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:28,291
After our son's death,
she tried to become our son as well.

617
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:42,958
Do you know Sid?

618
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:46,875
<i>Hello and welcome to the next chapter
of my surgical tutorials.</i>

619
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:50,666
<i>Today we are dealing
with the surgical procedure</i>

620
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,291
<i>using local anesthesia.</i>

621
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,250
<i>So, meet my team here.</i>

622
00:56:58,666 --> 00:56:59,666
<i>Shall we begin?</i>

623
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:02,958
"Today after gathering so much courage,
I finally told Sid...

624
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:05,125
about my pregnancy."

625
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:09,250
Anushka's diary reveals a lot about you.

626
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,250
- What's your version?
- Sir, I've been a complete jerk, sir.

627
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:17,375
When Anushka needed me the most...

628
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:19,791
I dumped her, sir.

629
00:57:21,666 --> 00:57:23,500
But what else could I do, sir?

630
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:26,291
The pregnancy news was too sudden.

631
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:27,791
I was scared, sir.

632
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:31,583
But now, I've realized
I can't live without her, sir.

633
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:33,208
I want to marry her.

634
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:36,583
- Sir, please find her. Please!
- Relax.

635
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:39,291
Relax. I will find her.

636
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,666
Did she ever mention any place
she could've gone to?

637
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:47,833
She wanted to go to a new city every day.

638
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:51,125
But that's because
she'd never been out of this town before.

639
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:55,083
- Did she ever threaten suicide?
- Why would she do that?

640
00:57:55,166 --> 00:57:58,250
She's pregnant.
Shame, fear of humiliation, etc.

641
00:57:58,333 --> 00:57:59,666
No way, sir.

642
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:03,041
Anushka never gave a rat's ass
about what people think.

643
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:05,500
When I suggested abortion,

644
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:08,000
she said she'll have the baby
with or without me.

645
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:09,958
But will never abort.

646
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,333
Hey!

647
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,916
Listen, I'm so sorry I commented
on your sexual preference.

648
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:17,875
I've nothing against gays.

649
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,875
In fact, I feel safe with you.

650
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,333
Will you forgive me? Please.

651
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
<i>Yes.</i>

652
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:29,541
Great. See, that's a start.

653
00:58:29,791 --> 00:58:30,791
Now we are talking.

654
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,125
Actually, I think you're a great guy.

655
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:35,833
We just got off
on the wrong foot, you know.

656
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:39,500
I'm really sorry
I kicked your ass and all of that

657
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,416
but I really want to make up for it.

658
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:43,083
Friends?

659
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:44,500
But first, tell me...

660
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:47,250
where are you taking me?

661
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,750
Why aren't you replying?

662
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,291
Now, we're friends, right?

663
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:51,541
What's the problem now?

664
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:52,625
Let me guess.

665
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:55,333
You're taking me out for some fresh air,
right?

666
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,041
Thank God!
You really are a true friend.

667
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:01,791
I was getting suffocated in there.

668
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:03,958
Hello?

669
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:08,125
What's this smell?

670
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:10,875
We're in a fucking hospital? Huh?

671
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:13,250
Why have you brought me to a hospital?

672
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,916
And why is it so quiet here?

673
00:59:16,416 --> 00:59:17,416
Is anyone there?

674
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:21,041
Anyone there? Hello, doctor?

675
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:24,250
Nurse? Hello, patient?

676
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:28,708
Help! Is anyone
in this God damned hospital?

677
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:30,791
Somebody please fucking help me.

678
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:32,458
<i>Surgical abortion...</i>

679
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:33,375
What the fuck?

680
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:35,333
<i>...using local anasthesia.</i>

681
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:37,833
You're learning to perform
abortion from an online tutorial?

682
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:39,250
Are you fucking crazy?

683
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:42,000
Surgeons spend six fucking years
to learn this.

684
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:43,833
You can't fucking do it like this.

685
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:47,416
Okay, please don't kill my baby.

686
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,250
For god's sake, have a heart. Please.

687
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:53,375
I beg of you, please let me go.
I swear, I'll never tell anyone about you.

688
00:59:53,458 --> 00:59:57,375
I'll say, I had run away,
realized my mistake, and returned back.

689
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,500
Please.

690
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:00,750
Please.

691
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:14,625
What if the girl escapes from the killer
and tells everyone about it?

692
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:27,083
<i>Does she know who you are?</i>

693
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,500
No!

694
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,833
She doesn't even know I'm a woman.

695
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,666
<i>Technically, it'll work.</i>

696
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,416
<i>But I wouldn't advise.</i>

697
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:43,125
<i>More criminals have got caught
trying to right their wrong</i>

698
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:45,250
<i>than while committing the actual crime.</i>

699
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:46,791
I'm not a criminal.

700
01:00:47,916 --> 01:00:50,083
I can't do this. I'm letting her go.

701
01:00:50,791 --> 01:00:56,333
But I will make sure,
she tells everyone about the killer.

702
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:06,541
I'm letting you go.

703
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,125
But on one condition.

704
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:15,541
You must tell everyone about me.

705
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:21,500
That fraud in prison is spoiling my image.

706
01:01:43,958 --> 01:01:45,458
Surprise, motherfucker.

707
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,250
Ma'am?

708
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:10,208
What are you doing here?

709
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:15,708
I... I came to save you.

710
01:02:19,166 --> 01:02:20,166
Where's the killer?

711
01:02:23,291 --> 01:02:25,708
I saw him going down
the stairs and sneaked in.

712
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:27,750
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

713
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:34,791
Same perfume.

714
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:35,875
Yes.

715
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:38,583
What perfume?

716
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:41,541
The one the killer was wearing.

717
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:46,250
Maybe his perfume
is still lingering in the room.

718
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:50,291
Or... maybe we both use the same brand.

719
01:02:51,791 --> 01:02:52,791
It's possible.

720
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,250
We should call for help.

721
01:02:57,291 --> 01:02:58,291
No!

722
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:00,250
Wait.

723
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:06,333
<i>Serial killer.</i>

724
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,250
<i>I'll kill you.</i>

725
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,291
Fucking bitch.

726
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:14,375
<i>Quiet!</i>

727
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,625
No, wait!

728
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:54,458
You fucking bitch.

729
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:04,791
This story is now about to end.

730
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:10,208
Though not as we imagined.

731
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:15,916
But we got to do what we got to do.

732
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:20,333
You're with me, right?

733
01:04:25,666 --> 01:04:27,916
I knew you would say that.

734
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:30,458
I love you.

735
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:32,125
Who are you talking to, you freak?

736
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:36,208
Shut the fuck up!

737
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:37,833
Help! Is anyone there?

738
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,625
Help! This psycho is trying to kill me!

739
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Trying to scare me with your psycho stare?

740
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:49,791
I can do better. Here.

741
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:07,125
What do you plan to do with that?
File my nails?

742
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:08,708
One more word...

743
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,458
and I swear I'll kill you right now!

744
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,583
Then kill me!
That's better than this daily torture!

745
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:26,250
You haven't seen torture...

746
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:36,666
until I've shown you.

747
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:43,208
Sir, we can't rely on you anymore.

748
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:46,000
We've decided to form our own vigilante.

749
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:48,291
There's no need to panic.

750
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:51,208
I assure you, I'll find this girl.

751
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:53,875
Like you found the others?

752
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:55,250
That was different.

753
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,125
And that killer is now in jail.

754
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:00,666
Who knows if Dr. Mukherjee
is even the killer?

755
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:02,875
I've complete evidence against him.

756
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:04,083
What about the evidence

757
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:06,958
of another girl missing from our town?
How do you explain that?

758
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:09,583
This girl has personal issues.
She may have run away.

759
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:11,000
May have run away.

760
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:12,875
Or maybe the killer is still out there.

761
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:16,583
And our innocent doctor is behind bars
because of your sloppiness.

762
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:20,125
Your doctor is not innocent. There's no
room for doubt in my investigation.

763
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:21,583
Sir!

764
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:24,291
Move. Sir, there was a call.

765
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:25,625
Who called, Angad?

766
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:29,041
The caller claimed
to be the serial killer.

767
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:33,583
And he said, you can find
the missing girl at the same place.

768
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:55,750
Anushka!

769
01:07:56,166 --> 01:07:58,000
Anushka!

770
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:02,833
This can't happen.

771
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,833
You can't leave me like this.

772
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:19,125
Good morning, ma'am.

773
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:21,625
- Ma'am.
- Hi, Ma'am.

774
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:41,666
<i>Divine!</i>

775
01:08:42,625 --> 01:08:45,458
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

776
01:08:45,541 --> 01:08:48,125
- Good morning, sir.
- So nice to see you back, sir.

777
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:20,708
- Defense?
- Your Honor.

778
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:28,291
Now that there has been another murder
while my client was in custody,

779
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:32,958
it's established that the serial killer
is still out there.

780
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:35,125
And my client is innocent.

781
01:09:35,916 --> 01:09:41,041
So, we ask
that the defendant be granted bail.

782
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:42,416
Prosecution?

783
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:47,458
But we have produced evidence
against him, Your Honor.

784
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,250
Madam, please.

785
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:53,791
That's an argument for another time.

786
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:56,500
We are not asking
for the verdict of innocence.

787
01:09:56,916 --> 01:09:58,458
All we are asking for is bail.

788
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:07,208
Okay, the defendant is granted bail.

789
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:36,916
- I want to show you something.
- Now?

790
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,291
It's important. It's really important.

791
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,375
What's going on, Sona?

792
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,166
I think I know what's happening.

793
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,958
The staff has organized
a surprise party for me, right?

794
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:50,833
You're really building the suspense.

795
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:52,625
Sona.

796
01:10:55,875 --> 01:10:56,708
The basement?

797
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:58,625
Can't be a party.

798
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:00,708
That's so...

799
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:04,416
Wow.

800
01:11:05,708 --> 01:11:06,958
There's a room here too?

801
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,083
I had no clue.

802
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:11,708
We could've put another bed...

803
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,809
This is the girl
whose body has supposedly been found.

804
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:17,875
What the fuck, Sona?

805
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:21,166
This...

806
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:26,541
I don't understand.

807
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:33,041
There was only one way
to prove your innocence.

808
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:39,416
Then I didn't want to do it. I was just...

809
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:46,166
So if she's still here...

810
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:49,250
whose body was that?

811
01:11:54,416 --> 01:11:57,375
That's just an unclaimed body and fetus

812
01:11:57,458 --> 01:11:58,916
I sourced from the hospital.

813
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:04,750
From where we regularly source
bodies for our college experiments.

814
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:11,583
Then my makeup and tattoo skills
came handy to make it resemble this girl.

815
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:16,166
I'm sorry.

816
01:12:19,833 --> 01:12:21,000
<i>Shona.</i>

817
01:12:22,791 --> 01:12:24,000
My baby.

818
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:31,833
I feel so miserable
for having put you through all this.

819
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
<i>Shona.</i>

820
01:12:38,416 --> 01:12:40,875
Nothing will happen. We are together.

821
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:44,291
But what do we do now, Joy?

822
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:47,791
What do we do with this girl?
She's seen me.

823
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,916
<i>Shona, baby.</i>

824
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:57,291
We must think
of a solution very calmly. Okay?

825
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:06,250
I can't believe I'm going to say this,
but thank God you're here.

826
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:08,375
You know, it's been driving me nuts.

827
01:13:08,875 --> 01:13:10,416
Why haven't you killed me yet?

828
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:12,250
It's all your fault!

829
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:16,875
I was letting you go, when you
had to act smart and try to escape.

830
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,166
Stupid girl!

831
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:23,125
If you hadn't seen me,
you wouldn't be my problem anymore.

832
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:29,041
But now, I don't know what to do with you.

833
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,041
Oh yeah, it's all my fault.

834
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:34,041
Then why are you feeding me?

835
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,416
Let me die.

836
01:13:36,916 --> 01:13:38,625
This is not for you.

837
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:43,416
It's for the baby inside you.

838
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:14,708
BAR

839
01:14:16,666 --> 01:14:17,708
No more service.

840
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:22,500
Why? What's the matter?
You're out of stock?

841
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,625
We are out of respect for you.

842
01:14:24,708 --> 01:14:28,458
The person who framed our beloved
doctor is not welcome here anymore.

843
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:32,291
Look, I understand your feelings.

844
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,791
But please don't do this tonight.

845
01:14:35,916 --> 01:14:37,250
I badly need to drink today.

846
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:39,791
And I don't want anyone
to stop me from drinking!

847
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:42,083
Bash the bastard!

848
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:48,250
Hey, baby. This is dada.

849
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:50,916
Dada.

850
01:14:52,916 --> 01:14:53,916
Listen.

851
01:14:54,916 --> 01:14:56,583
I've thought of a nice name for you.

852
01:14:57,208 --> 01:14:58,583
Let me know what you think.

853
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:01,375
Antim.

854
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:03,833
Antim.

855
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,458
What if it's a girl?

856
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:14,166
Girl?

857
01:15:16,041 --> 01:15:17,500
Haven't thought of that.

858
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,000
We'll call her Anushka.

859
01:15:26,416 --> 01:15:27,416
Anushka.

860
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:04,333
Help!

861
01:16:06,958 --> 01:16:08,541
I'm stuck in the basement.

862
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:12,708
Yes, I can hear you.
You're in the right direction.

863
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:14,916
Just a little ahead. I'm right here.

864
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:19,500
Who's it?

865
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Who's that?

866
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,666
I think it's the killer.

867
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:47,875
Hide.

868
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:49,833
Fuck that bitch. I'm going to kill her.

869
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:52,875
Hide. Get a rod.

870
01:16:57,416 --> 01:16:59,208
Not there, you fool. She'll see you.

871
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:00,375
Hide in the cupboard.

872
01:17:06,333 --> 01:17:07,333
Fuck.

873
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:18,875
Oh, shit!

874
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:39,625
Joy?

875
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:43,416
<i>The person you are calling, is not
answering.</i>

876
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,750
<i>Please try...</i>

877
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:48,875
Hello, Mrs. Serial Killer.

878
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:53,625
Did I scare you? I wanted to wake you,

879
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:55,708
but you were sleeping like a baby.

880
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:56,833
Come in. Come.

881
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:59,333
So I didn't disturb you.

882
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:00,875
Quiet!

883
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:04,000
Come in, shona.

884
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:05,875
Come in, baby.

885
01:19:07,791 --> 01:19:08,791
Come on.

886
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:10,958
Come in.

887
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:13,166
Come.

888
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:19,041
Joy?

889
01:19:21,208 --> 01:19:22,333
what are you doing here?

890
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:27,791
I realized, she needs a surgery.

891
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:31,458
What surgery?

892
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:39,291
Abortion.

893
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:43,333
Why?

894
01:19:45,833 --> 01:19:47,416
Because she's a whore.

895
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:50,041
Just like my birth mother.

896
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:51,833
But you don't even know her.

897
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:55,375
You didn't even know your birth mother.

898
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:56,916
I know them all.

899
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:03,000
They're all the same.

900
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:09,041
Fucking whores!

901
01:20:11,291 --> 01:20:13,750
Whores who get pregnant out of wedlock.

902
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:19,375
Then either abort the innocent child,
or dump it after it's born,

903
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:24,250
for some pervert to adopt and molest them!

904
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:27,291
I understand bad things
might have happened to you.

905
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:33,625
But that doesn't give
you the right to punish anyone.

906
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:36,125
I'm not punishing anyone.

907
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,041
Who am I?

908
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:41,125
That their God will do.

909
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:45,458
I'm only arranging their meeting.

910
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:46,941
And what about those unborn babies?

911
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,125
I keep them safely.

912
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:54,708
In my bottles.

913
01:20:57,375 --> 01:21:00,458
They're safer in my bottles
than in this cruel world.

914
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:11,916
I know what you're thinking.

915
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:17,291
This is your moment of choice.

916
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,416
But remember...

917
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:27,500
you have the freedom of choice,

918
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:30,708
but not the freedom of consequence.

919
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:37,291
Don't!

920
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,250
Joy!

921
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:04,458
Joy!

922
01:22:07,166 --> 01:22:08,291
Joy!

923
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:10,500
To hell with Joy.

924
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:13,541
My name is Mrityunjoy.

925
01:22:14,583 --> 01:22:16,916
If you insist on shortening it,
call me Mrityu.

926
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,791
Joy, Joy, Joy.

927
01:22:19,166 --> 01:22:22,041
I'm not a fuckin' ice cream!

928
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:24,291
Call me Mrityu.

929
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:28,041
- Mrityu.
- Yeah.

930
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:33,333
Oh, the sweet sound of death.

931
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:46,875
Yes, hello, sir.

932
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:51,458
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

933
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:54,666
Shona? She's right here.

934
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:58,375
Wait a second. Speak to her.

935
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:02,291
<i>How are you, Sona?</i>

936
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:03,791
Help!

937
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:07,875
Yes, sir, she can't talk right now.

938
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:10,833
No, not cold.

939
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:18,125
She's got a little knife through her hand.

940
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:20,333
Yes, she got to know.

941
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:22,958
About you?

942
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:29,125
Well, I think...

943
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:31,666
she does now.

944
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:41,500
No, sir. No, don't worry.
Don't worry, sir.

945
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:44,125
She won't tell anyone.

946
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:45,541
I'll take care of her.

947
01:23:47,291 --> 01:23:48,375
Good night.

948
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:58,041
Rastogi and I go a long way.
He has got me out of trouble before.

949
01:24:02,291 --> 01:24:05,833
Shona, you must be feeling

950
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:09,416
like you're watching the climax
of 'Sixth Sense', right?

951
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:15,583
But you know, <i>Sixth Sense</i>
is more fun the second time.

952
01:24:16,666 --> 01:24:18,791
That's when you realize

953
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:23,500
how everything was right
in front of you all the time.

954
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,666
But you never realized it.

955
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:35,000
Sit down. Relax.

956
01:24:35,458 --> 01:24:39,708
Replay all our scenes and enjoy.

957
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:41,125
Thank you.

958
01:24:44,083 --> 01:24:45,791
- Thank you.
- No.

959
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:49,708
Joy!

960
01:24:58,708 --> 01:25:00,833
Let's rock and roll.

961
01:25:04,083 --> 01:25:06,666
Stop! Please stop. Don't do that.

962
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:08,916
Don’t! Don't do it.

963
01:25:09,583 --> 01:25:10,583
- No.
- Please!

964
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:14,875
Please, stop!

965
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:16,250
Stop!

966
01:25:42,166 --> 01:25:43,375
- Who's it?
- Sid.

967
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:49,625
You know, that's one of the most
common names in our country today.

968
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:52,541
- So, a little clarity might help.
- I'm Anushka's boyfriend.

969
01:25:55,625 --> 01:25:57,500
I'm stuck here. The door is jammed.

970
01:25:57,583 --> 01:25:59,500
Please let me out. Please.

971
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:40,375
You know what? I was always a shy kid.

972
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,791
Can you believe that shy kid

973
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:51,250
is now going to perform
in front of an audience of two?

974
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:53,958
Wow.

975
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Wish me good luck.

976
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:02,750
Where's my scalpel? Scalpel?

977
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:10,333
I guess I'll have to get another one.

978
01:27:11,791 --> 01:27:12,916
Okay, it's all right.

979
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:15,500
Okay guys, behave yourselves.

980
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:16,625
No mischief.

981
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,083
Pin-drop silence.

982
01:27:22,708 --> 01:27:23,708
Okay, guys?

983
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:33,958
What a mess.

984
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:14,916
Get up.

985
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:18,125
Get up. Quick.

986
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:19,750
Move back.

987
01:28:20,666 --> 01:28:21,875
Keep moving.

988
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:24,625
Pick up that chair.

989
01:28:26,583 --> 01:28:28,875
Sit down.

990
01:28:39,791 --> 01:28:40,791
Hands behind.

991
01:28:47,166 --> 01:28:50,500
Shona, I hope
there are no more guests coming.

992
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:52,416
I've run out of chairs.

993
01:28:54,791 --> 01:28:57,833
Mr. Rastogi spoke a lot about you.

994
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:01,250
Glad we got a chance to meet.

995
01:29:02,875 --> 01:29:05,375
I was wondering how you knew...

996
01:29:34,083 --> 01:29:35,083
My sister.

997
01:29:41,208 --> 01:29:42,375
Afreen.

998
01:29:45,916 --> 01:29:46,916
She was your sister?

999
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:55,791
And I thought
our love triangle is going on.

1000
01:29:58,958 --> 01:30:00,958
You were only trying
to avenge your sister's death.

1001
01:30:09,916 --> 01:30:13,375
But I still don't get...

1002
01:30:15,291 --> 01:30:18,125
how did you find me?

1003
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
What's funny?

1004
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:24,250
Nothing, doctor.

1005
01:30:26,416 --> 01:30:27,666
Just remembered a joke.

1006
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:28,750
Really?

1007
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:32,625
Must be really funny,
if it made you laugh at a time like this.

1008
01:30:33,125 --> 01:30:34,125
Very funny.

1009
01:30:35,291 --> 01:30:36,125
Want to listen?

1010
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:38,125
Oh, fuck!

1011
01:30:38,958 --> 01:30:40,291
I love comedy.

1012
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:45,000
Let's start. Come on. Can't wait.

1013
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:51,083
I was in love with Sona.

1014
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:54,333
I wanted to marry her.

1015
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:58,708
That's not fair.

1016
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,875
Sounds like romance. You promised comedy.

1017
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:05,208
- This is not fair.
- Have patience, doctor.

1018
01:31:06,125 --> 01:31:07,125
It's coming.

1019
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:12,208
But before I could marry Sona...

1020
01:31:14,083 --> 01:31:16,291
I got the news of my sister's murder.

1021
01:31:20,416 --> 01:31:23,583
When I rushed back home
and investigated, I learned...

1022
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:29,375
she had recently met a gynecologist,
which was odd...

1023
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:32,708
as she was unmarried.

1024
01:31:34,791 --> 01:31:35,791
Fuck.

1025
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:40,666
Doctor?

1026
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:46,333
Excuse me, Doctor.

1027
01:31:54,833 --> 01:31:57,625
So you're that cop?

1028
01:31:59,583 --> 01:32:00,583
You didn't die?

1029
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:02,208
No, doctor.

1030
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:07,000
But thanks to you,
I was in coma for two years.

1031
01:32:09,708 --> 01:32:10,708
Thriller.

1032
01:32:12,375 --> 01:32:15,208
Look, I'm losing patience.

1033
01:32:16,708 --> 01:32:18,041
Where's the comedy?

1034
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:19,583
Coming soon, doctor.

1035
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:25,958
When I regained consciousness, the first
thing I did was try to contact Sona.

1036
01:32:29,416 --> 01:32:34,166
But I learnt, she had to marry
the guy her parents had chosen.

1037
01:32:35,666 --> 01:32:38,333
Tragedy. Okay.

1038
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:42,291
He has given everything but comedy.

1039
01:32:43,041 --> 01:32:45,250
Where is the fucking comedy?

1040
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:49,708
Where is the comedy? I want comedy!

1041
01:32:49,791 --> 01:32:51,375
Calm down, doctor. This is the spice.

1042
01:32:51,458 --> 01:32:53,958
It has everything. Now comes the comedy.

1043
01:32:58,458 --> 01:33:00,291
Though sad about losing her...

1044
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:05,291
I was happy that now I could
dedicate all my time after you.

1045
01:33:07,833 --> 01:33:10,916
I learnt you had settled in this town.

1046
01:33:13,291 --> 01:33:15,833
But didn't have any evidence on you.

1047
01:33:17,541 --> 01:33:20,583
So I took my posting here,
to catch you in the act.

1048
01:33:22,916 --> 01:33:24,791
But after coming here, what do I see?

1049
01:33:26,458 --> 01:33:30,875
The love of my life
had married the hate of my life.

1050
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:35,375
What a fucking joke!

1051
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:10,958
Oh, dear!

1052
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,250
Oh!

1053
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:13,583
Oh, fuck.

1054
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:15,375
Very funny.

1055
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:22,000
But what's even more funny

1056
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:26,208
is you still never found
any evidence against me.

1057
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:29,583
I was fed up of waiting for it.

1058
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:33,583
So I planted them and nailed you.

1059
01:34:33,666 --> 01:34:37,833
Okay. That's enough.

1060
01:34:38,541 --> 01:34:40,250
That's enough.

1061
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:45,291
So now,

1062
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:51,583
now that romance,
thriller, tragedy and comedy is over...

1063
01:34:52,708 --> 01:34:53,708
Okay?

1064
01:34:55,333 --> 01:34:56,625
Time for some...

1065
01:34:58,166 --> 01:34:59,166
Action.

1066
01:35:05,458 --> 01:35:08,666
And since a Bengali is at the helm
of this action sequence,

1067
01:35:09,208 --> 01:35:13,333
Mrityunjoy Mukherjee... that is, <i>moi,</i>

1068
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:17,875
artistic aesthetics
are of prime importance.

1069
01:35:18,375 --> 01:35:20,041
Appropriate lighting.

1070
01:35:23,708 --> 01:35:26,291
Appropriate music.

1071
01:36:34,833 --> 01:36:36,291
Hey! Wait!

1072
01:36:40,333 --> 01:36:41,333
Hey, scoundrel.

1073
01:36:44,583 --> 01:36:47,458
Free Sid. Take Anushka to the hospital.
Hurry!

1074
01:36:57,625 --> 01:36:58,708
Fast! Move!

1075
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:00,375
You'll be okay, baby.

1076
01:37:01,333 --> 01:37:02,333
Take her.

1077
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:05,541
Quick. Quick, let's get out.

1078
01:37:10,416 --> 01:37:12,708
No! Joy!

1079
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:27,958
Joy!

1080
01:37:48,041 --> 01:37:50,666
- Are you okay, baby? Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1081
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:20,416
My b...

1082
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:23,625
My baby.

1083
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:34,500
Your child has paid
the price for your sins.

1084
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:40,375
And... I've paid for mine.

1085
01:38:47,416 --> 01:38:51,333
My baby.

1086
01:38:55,416 --> 01:38:57,291
My baby!

1087
01:39:01,791 --> 01:39:02,791
You whore!

1088
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:46,583
Anushka?

1089
01:39:47,833 --> 01:39:48,833
She's fine.

1090
01:40:04,708 --> 01:40:06,333
You'll be discharged in a week.

1091
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,166
You seem to be in a hurry
to take me to prison.

1092
01:40:18,291 --> 01:40:19,541
You're not going to prison.

1093
01:40:21,625 --> 01:40:23,583
Anushka is not pressing charges.

1094
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:27,500
Why?

1095
01:40:27,791 --> 01:40:29,791
Because you saved my life.

1096
01:40:33,458 --> 01:40:34,708
And if it were not for you,

1097
01:40:34,791 --> 01:40:37,458
this idiot
would never have realized my worth.

1098
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:39,375
Guilty as charged.

1099
01:40:40,041 --> 01:40:41,250
All thanks to you.

1100
01:40:42,958 --> 01:40:44,000
We're getting married.

1101
01:40:46,166 --> 01:40:47,000
And...

1102
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:51,291
maybe you two
should also think of starting a new life.

1103
01:40:58,208 --> 01:40:59,208
Hello?

1104
01:41:03,541 --> 01:41:04,541
How are you feeling?

1105
01:41:05,833 --> 01:41:06,833
Fine, doctor.

1106
01:41:08,708 --> 01:41:11,125
Nothing can make up for your loss.

1107
01:41:12,666 --> 01:41:16,041
But if it's any consolation, it's entirely
possible for you to get pregnant again.

1108
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:19,583
Thank you, doctor.

1109
01:41:19,666 --> 01:41:21,958
- Excuse me, doctor.
- Yes?

1110
01:41:23,166 --> 01:41:24,791
Has the body gone for postmortem?

1111
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
What body?

1112
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:29,583
The dead body I had brought along.

1113
01:41:30,791 --> 01:41:31,791
Oh, that one.

1114
01:41:32,666 --> 01:41:34,583
He's not dead. We managed to save him.

1115
01:41:38,541 --> 01:41:39,541
Fuck.

1116
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:41,541
Where's he now?

1117
01:41:54,041 --> 01:41:55,166
Excuse me.

1118
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,000
Where's this patient?

1119
01:41:57,916 --> 01:41:58,916
He was right here.

1120
01:41:59,375 --> 01:42:00,791
How can he disappear?

1121
01:42:01,208 --> 01:42:02,333
He was unconscious.

1122
01:42:17,833 --> 01:42:19,166
Did anyone see you?

1123
01:42:21,041 --> 01:42:22,041
Nope.
