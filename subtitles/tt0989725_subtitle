1
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,868
Open the door, the bell has rung!

2
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,493
The bell has rung!

3
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:32,048
Wash the clothes.

4
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,056
Today is your date, right.

5
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,821
Yes, l will get home
cooked food to eat.

6
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,703
lts early morning. And already they
are squabbling for the bathroom.

7
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,710
l think today there
will be a heavy rush.

8
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:00,779
Now watch the fun!

9
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,828
Look! My rule reigns in the prison.
- That is true.

10
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,021
Bhai! Look!

11
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,456
Why are you staring?

12
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:26,472
l see! l see! So he is
the new undertrial.

13
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,403
376.

14
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,580
Scoundrel!

15
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,417
He is in trouble! Now watch the fun!

16
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:45,374
Leave him! Leave him! Leave him!

17
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,780
Wait! Wait!

18
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,429
Sir, he has been brought yesterday.

19
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,800
Undertrial prisoner. 307, 376.

20
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,600
lf you keep him here, the
prisoners will kill him.

21
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,676
Shift him to the safe yard
right now. - Yes, sir.

22
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,341
Jailor sir, whether you keep
him in the safe yard..

23
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,814
..or Scotland yard.. we will
not spare this scoundrel!

24
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,851
You won't even reach the High Oourt.

25
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,011
You will die in this prison itself.

26
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,681
You will die in this prison itself!
Oonsiders himself very smart!

27
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,882
We will have fun!

28
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,687
ldiot! Get inside! Oome on!

29
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,785
He deserves this.

30
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:07,662
But unfortunately.. his
protection is our duty.

31
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,274
Keep him in cell number 5.

32
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,641
Okay, sir.
- Good morning, Jailor sir.

33
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,580
Wow! Even in the prison,
your morning is good!

34
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,447
What to do, sir? l have
to accept my fate.

35
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,723
Scoundrel! l have to tell him!

36
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,817
2 pairs of clothes are left.

37
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,418
Wash one and wear the other.

38
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:42,763
These prisoners.. they
ruin my clothes.

39
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,564
ls this a prison or what?

40
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,366
Round the clock there is only
cooking. lt's spreading like a virus.

41
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,633
Oome on!

42
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,044
Nadir sir is praying.

43
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,284
Nadir sir, he is Sagar Hussain.

44
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,656
He was in the general ward.

45
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,524
There the prisoners
are after his life.

46
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:16,693
He raped his 3 real daughters
incessantly for 8 years.

47
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,531
Scoundrel!

48
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,296
Oome on!

49
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,285
'Scoundrel! You commit
immoral deeds!'

50
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,293
'Now l will show you!'

51
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,421
'Scoundrel! You cast lustful
eyes on your daughters!'

52
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,433
'Now see what l do to you! Oome!'

53
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,299
'Lock him up!'

54
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:56,338
'Scoundrel! Was there a
dearth of prostitutes..

55
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,433
..that you started raping
your daughters!'

56
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,773
'Now l will show you the
outcome of raping!'

57
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,406
'You dare to rape!'

58
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,413
Bala's mother-in-law has come.

59
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,614
What do you mean?

60
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:13,283
Bala's mother-in-law
means Ohapan Bhog.

61
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,484
What do you mean?

62
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,222
Meaning 'Shrikant', 'Basundi',
'Ladoo', 'Jalebi'..

63
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,527
..'Ohiranjee', 'Sakarbhat',
'Sudaras' (Types of sweets).

64
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,759
Quickly eat it!

65
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,360
Sagar Hussain, eat it quickly!

66
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,404
You have to go to
the court. Oome on!

67
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,841
Hey, give me 2 loaves of bread more.

68
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,637
You won't lose anything.
lt is government food.

69
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,575
Hey! Hey!

70
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,805
Hey, virus!

71
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,280
Greetings.
- Greetings.

72
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,407
Shall l get something for you?

73
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,419
No, thanks. That boy has
gone to get it. - Okay.

74
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,620
Session court's prisoners, come on.

75
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:50,560
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

76
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,568
Oome on! Sit here!

77
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:02,538
Oome on! Don't try to
act smart! Get inside!

78
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:08,539
Look, if you told animal to
become human, it will refuse.

79
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:09,842
Saying l don't want to be a human.

80
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,610
l will have to take the
rounds of the court.

81
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,685
Such is the fear of the court.
- But..

82
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,784
We will fight. Vishnoi sir
will fight your case.

83
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,356
How will he not fight if l said?

84
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,722
But he is a famous attorney.
lncentive will also be high. - What?

85
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,296
Fees! Fees!

86
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,228
lts not that after taking the fees,
he will take you to the judge..

87
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,766
..and the decision will be made.

88
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:32,565
No! No, no, no! This is the court!

89
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,933
lts procedure is different.

90
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,773
Don't assume that court has
only lawyers and judge.

91
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,810
No! Other people are also involved.

92
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,279
Like the person who
sells stamp paper..

93
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,713
..the typists.. the peon.. etc.

94
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:48,548
And they wear clothes. Olothes
that has pocket.

95
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:52,653
They all squeeze the client well.

96
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,022
Then they present him in front
of the judge. Understood?

97
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,727
And the decision is not
taken immediately.

98
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:01,765
There is proceeding. There
is cross examination.

99
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,732
You get tired of talking!

100
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,860
Only after that the judge
takes a decision.

101
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,338
And don't think that the decision
will be taken in your favour.

102
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,342
What? Because here if
there is justice..

103
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,344
..then there is injustice too.

104
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,711
Understood?
- No.

105
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,716
Justice and injustice
are two brothers.

106
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,919
Evidence act is their father.

107
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,422
And lndian penal code
is their mother.

108
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,683
And this court is their
parental home.

109
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,358
Understood? And we need witnesses.

110
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,726
And to buy fake witness,
you need money.

111
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,093
You have to bribe them.

112
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,729
The expense will be 1 lakh.

113
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,359
Give 25,000 rupees in advance.

114
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,998
Sir, my friend is an ordinary
man working in Javi factory.

115
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,367
lf he is an ordinary man,
then why did..

116
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,499
..he commit such a serious crime?

117
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,409
He should have seen his status
and then committed the crime.

118
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,538
You do one thing.
Find somebody else.

119
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,673
l don't have the time.

120
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,751
l have 5,000 rupees.

121
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,650
5,000 rupees! l will
even take 500 rupees!

122
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,987
But you see.. our Vishnoi sir.
- Yes.

123
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,686
He won't come to the court till the
time you don't show him money.

124
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,427
What is this? Bundles of 1 rupee.

125
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,833
Have you got it in charity!

126
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,663
Or you are a beggar in some shrine?

127
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,963
No problem. Just take what you get.
- Oome on!

128
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,430
Where is my client?

129
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,564
Oome.

130
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,872
Sir, he is my friend Sagar Hussain.

131
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,075
You have to fight his case.

132
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,981
You have committed 3 rapes!

133
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,351
Even if you had committed 30 rapes..

134
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,617
..still Vishnoi sir
would have saved you.

135
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,090
Listen!
- Yes.

136
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,821
Let's divide our work.

137
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,362
You concentrate on cash. l will
concentrate on the case.

138
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,643
Your Honour, he is Sagar Hussain.

139
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,476
The hearing date has to be fixed.

140
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,640
Where is the file?

141
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,709
Your Honour, the registrar has
asked for the case file.

142
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,289
Because of public interest in
the case and the media hype..

143
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,291
..the prosecution had appealed
to the Home department..

144
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,362
..that a lady judge should
handle this case.

145
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,591
For this justice J.R. Reddy
has been appointed.

146
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,564
And today is her off, Your Honour.

147
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,461
Monday the 15th.

148
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,629
Thank you, Your Honour.

149
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,762
Oome on!

150
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,505
Here comes the father
of 3 daughters.

151
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,636
Dear father..

152
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,078
Father.

153
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,485
Sir, he has been wounded
in the police custody.

154
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,917
Send him to the OM.

155
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,352
And send his injury and testimony
report to the court.

156
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,356
lf anything happened to him here..

157
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,426
..then the jail authorities
will be held responsible.

158
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,427
Take him to the hospital, Major.

159
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,953
Stand straight.
- Sir, it tickles.

160
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,760
Stand straight.

161
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:48,891
Go!

162
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,025
Go!

163
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,925
Oome here!

164
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,095
Hey, stop!

165
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,865
Pappu, come here!

166
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,937
Sir.
- What is in this?

167
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,910
Sir.. sir.. sir.. its urine.

168
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,448
Major!
- Yes, sir! - Oheck him!

169
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,574
What is it?

170
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:06,708
Sir, its urine.

171
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,014
Sir, its urine.
- But check it.

172
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,486
Show it!
- Sir, its urine. - Show me!

173
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,453
Sir, this is oil.

174
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,361
Were you taking it
for the prisoners?

175
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,367
Scoundrel!
- Answer!

176
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,800
Will you sell it to the prisoners!

177
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:25,926
Keep a tab on him!

178
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,299
Oome on! Oome on!

179
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,963
You carry oil in the prison!

180
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,932
He has come! What happened?

181
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:35,513
Listen! Sagar's case will be
handled by justice J.R. Reddy.

182
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,412
Now he will get life sentence!
Nobody can save him!

183
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:39,711
You are so sure!

184
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,480
l am here with whose grace?

185
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,353
l was travelling to Thane
by a local train.

186
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,583
A beautiful girl was
standing in front.

187
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,626
l hit a peanut on her back.

188
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,662
The constable was standing behind.
He put me behind bars.

189
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,659
'The court declares
6 months sentence.'

190
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:59,101
'But, justice. l had only
thrown a peanut on her.'

191
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,603
'l didn't even touch her.'

192
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,229
'lf you had touched her,
l would have given..

193
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,602
..imprisonment term of 4 years.'

194
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,006
'But, justice..
- Shut up!'

195
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,607
'What do you people think
of women? A Barbie doll!'

196
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,281
'Whenever you want, you tease her..

197
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,975
..throw acid on her.. rape her.'

198
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,343
'Take him away!'

199
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,477
Just think.

200
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:21,788
lf l had pinched her bum, then l
would have been locked for life.

201
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:25,727
Nobody can save Sagar. He is gone!

202
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,524
Now watch the fun!

203
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,765
Hey! What is going on!
What is going on!

204
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,337
Get inside! Get inside!

205
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,498
Hey!
- Major sir.

206
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:36,665
What happened?

207
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,471
Major sir, will you please
post my letter?

208
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,404
You have written it to your wife?

209
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,038
Who else will l write, sir?

210
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,611
l am staying here for
the past 6 months.

211
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,550
Who else will remember me?

212
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,851
Fine. l will take it to
the gate. Go away. Go.

213
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,515
God bless you.

214
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,355
Get lost!
- Thanks.

215
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,520
Hey!

216
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,523
Sir!

217
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,227
A prisoner named Nattu Jambondia..

218
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,632
..has given this letter to post.

219
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,294
Sir, sign on it.

220
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,338
This is in Gujarati. Solanki!

221
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,809
Yes, sir.
- Oome here.

222
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,013
Read it and tell me what
is written in it.

223
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,418
Sir, now l will recite it in Hindi.

224
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,959
Lachi.. l miss you a lot.

225
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,690
On the stone floor, l twist
and turn and spend the night.

226
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:33,958
l don't know when
l will be released.

227
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,992
You must be short of money.

228
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,296
Listen, the yellow bag of food
grains that l had brought from..

229
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,962
..Junagardh, l had buried it
in the field with the well.

230
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,300
Dig it out.

231
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,500
And listen, don't show off
the food grains too much.

232
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,476
Sell each grain and
live like a queen.

233
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,416
And in front of others, pretend
as if you are a pauper.

234
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,678
l hope you have understood
the meaning of the letter.

235
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,720
Your husband, Nattu Jambondia.

236
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,763
Greetings. Mr. Tasawade
from crime branch.

237
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,461
Yes.

238
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,770
l am in hurry.

239
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,898
What an atmosphere!

240
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,840
The entire law and order
is gathered here!

241
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:23,904
Scoundrel! The government officer
himself is in prison as a deceiver.

242
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,907
Spreading like a virus!

243
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,283
Death is better than
this humiliation.

244
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,620
Sir! Sir, please be strong!

245
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:34,750
How!

246
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,690
Nobody outside dared to utter
one such word to us!

247
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:45,430
Hey! Outside too you were
a coward in front of me.

248
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:49,499
Forgot? Nadir, explain to him.

249
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,342
This is a prison! Not a rail!

250
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,345
We are not travelling here.
We are undertrial.

251
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,539
Understood? Explain to him!

252
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:05,748
Mr. Nimare.. l consider this not
as a prison, but as a rail.

253
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,919
We all are undertrial travellers.

254
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,224
Our train is stationed
at the station..

255
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,821
..as it has not got the signal.

256
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,230
After getting the signal..
everybody will..

257
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,530
..go towards their destination.

258
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:29,274
Sir.. if you think like this.. then
this journey will be covered easily.

259
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,814
Sit sometimes at least!

260
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,353
The rest is God's will.

261
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,819
God's will! You are
right, Mr. Nadir.

262
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,589
You are right. The
rest is God's will.

263
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,024
Where we have landed up!

264
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,768
Earlier we would walk proudly,
wearing our uniform.

265
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,006
Outside. And today we are in prison.

266
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,341
Earlier those who
were afraid of us..

267
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,208
..today we are amidst them.

268
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:06,448
We can't sleep at night!

269
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,752
Mr. Nimare.. l can't sleep.

270
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,281
How can we sleep?

271
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,350
We have been falsely accused.

272
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:22,666
Bribe takers.. corruption!
Am l corrupt!

273
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,735
Tell me! Tell me! Am l corrupt!

274
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,870
And where will you not
find corruption?

275
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,905
lf you want a nice job.. corruption.

276
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,813
Give bribe. You want a nice
posting. Give bribe.

277
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,286
l only genuinely helped
somebody in a case..

278
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:48,985
..and l was accused of taking bribe!

279
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,695
Sir.. its our mistake too.

280
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,301
Our psychology is such
that we always..

281
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,699
..consider the complainant
as innocent.

282
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,702
When in fact we should
think how honest he is.

283
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,741
Hey! What?

284
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,470
That scoundrel 376 is coming.

285
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,602
Oome.

286
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,907
We will first bash him.

287
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,378
Hey, beard man!

288
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,620
That day we didn't thrash
you completely.

289
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,386
Today we will thrash
him black and blue!

290
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,524
Look.. don't lock horns with me.

291
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:31,367
You know.. what l am accused
of, don't you?

292
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,839
l don't belong to anybody.
Think about it.

293
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,337
We have already thought!

294
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,876
We have got the chance! Now
we won't spare you! - Stop!

295
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:47,444
So many times l have told you
guys.. don't behave like this.

296
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,521
Nadir sir, you don't interfere.

297
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,020
l am not interfering.

298
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,017
You both are interfering.

299
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:58,292
Look.. we all are equals here.

300
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:04,433
lf he has been accused.. then
you too have been accused.

301
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,839
lf he has committed any crime..
then God will take the decision.

302
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,769
Why are you interfering
in God's affair?

303
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,542
Go. Go!

304
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,986
That scoundrel escaped today too.

305
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,484
Sagar escaped because of Nadir.

306
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,930
Nadir is becoming Sagar's
sympathiser.

307
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:36,364
Jailor sir has told Nadir
to take his side.

308
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,492
ls that so?
- Yes.

309
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,901
Hey!
- Go and bring Munna.

310
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,027
Yes, Bhai. l will just send him.

311
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,499
No Jailor will be able to save him.

312
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,476
He will die in this yard
itself. Understood!

313
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,603
Bhai, you called me.

314
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:53,577
Munna.. now whenever you will
go to the safe yard..

315
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:54,709
Yes.

316
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:57,849
Give this to Mausim.

317
00:20:58,523 --> 00:20:59,717
Get lost!

318
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,451
ls it done?
- Yes, Bhai.

319
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,823
Oome, Munna.

320
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,624
Greetings.
- Greetings.

321
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,028
How are you?
- Fine.

322
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,827
Major is standing.

323
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,903
Attack Sagar when
you get the chance.

324
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,539
Sagar Hussain Vs State
of Maharashtra.

325
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,344
The prosecution has charged
you of section 307 meaning..

326
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,476
..attempt of murder and
section 376 meaning rape.

327
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,884
Do you want to say anything?

328
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,425
Say.. all the evidences
against me are false.

329
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,859
l am innocent. Say it!

330
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,697
Mr. Apte.. silence please!

331
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,426
Sorry.

332
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,631
l am innocent.

333
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,605
Public prosecutor, Mr. Anand Verma.

334
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,432
Yes, Your Honour.

335
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:56,837
Have you given the defence witness
list and the other documents?

336
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,074
Yes, Your Honour.

337
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,346
Mr. Verma, present the
witness within 3 days.

338
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,944
l want to end this case
within 20 days.

339
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,584
Do you know what a daughter means?

340
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,718
Daughter is a fragment of the
mother, not a thing of lust.

341
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:42,655
They are considered lucky.
And you raped them.

342
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:49,696
Your daughters didn't come to know
when they lost their childhood.

343
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:54,494
Their teeth had still not fully
grown.. and you raped them.

344
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,072
l despise you, Sagar Hussain.

345
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,432
l despise you!

346
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,280
lf law didn't give you the
severest punishment..

347
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,545
..then this will be
a disgrace of law.

348
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:08,949
lt will be its humiliation.

349
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,288
lf l had to take the decision,
l would have..

350
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,915
..hanged you on the noose.

351
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:20,358
Still.. still life imprisonment
is for sure.

352
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,433
And that too neat life.

353
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,838
You will squirm in the prison
for your breathe.

354
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,733
But you will not come
out of the prison.

355
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,046
Bhai! Bhai! Sagar is returning
from the court!

356
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,060
Bhai! Bhai! The police
force is coming!

357
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,775
Everybody enter the cell one by one!

358
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,379
Move! Move! Move!

359
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,679
Side! Side!

360
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,807
What happened?

361
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,010
What all things they have hidden!

362
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,279
What will you find in my cell, sir?

363
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,411
Move the pot.

364
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,783
Move it!

365
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,288
Nothing is there, sir!
Listen to me, sir.

366
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,291
Mobile phone!

367
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,485
And wiring for the charging!

368
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,422
Sir! Telephone exchange!

369
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,360
What all things you have hidden!

370
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,489
Blade!

371
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,294
Did you keep it to murder somebody?

372
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,425
Oome on!

373
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:31,559
Oome outside! Oome on!

374
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,301
What to do? lt's the influence
of the ambience.

375
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,340
lf you stayed amidst criminals,
then forget using abusive words..

376
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,909
..you will even start murdering.

377
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,708
l will tell you something new.

378
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,577
God created this entire world.

379
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:45,707
Then he rested.

380
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,752
Then he created the plants,
trees and birds.

381
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,082
Then he rested.

382
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,647
Then he created men.
Again he rested.

383
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,356
Then he created those women.

384
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,361
After that neither did God rest..

385
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,658
..nor men got the chance to rest.

386
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,303
Hey! Nimare! Laugh! lt was a joke!

387
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:11,767
Worship time! Worship time!

388
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,539
Nadir sir. Worship time!
Didn't you hear?

389
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,009
Pakiya!
- Yes, sir!

390
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,079
Are you cooking?
- Yes, sir.

391
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,644
Make some tea for me too.

392
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,812
Will virus do?
- What is this virus?

393
00:25:56,922 --> 00:26:00,449
l am burning that chef's
toothbrush and cooking.

394
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,454
Spreading like a virus!

395
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,224
Hey, you!

396
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,697
The governor is calling!
- Go!

397
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,359
Hey, you!

398
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:11,963
lnspector!

399
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,305
Since when l am shouting!

400
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,409
Why are you yelling so much?
Am l deaf? What happened?

401
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,511
Give this to the person
in the vicinity cell.

402
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:25,339
Yes, governor sir. You are
the boss. l am the servant.

403
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,919
Major! Oan't you even
do this much for me?

404
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,288
You are here because
of us prisoners.

405
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,756
And you have a job that
earns you money.

406
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,520
lt would have been better if
there had been no prisoners.

407
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,927
At least we wouldn't
have to do this job.

408
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:44,730
Here. Eat it. Eat it. Have fun!

409
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,970
Eat it. You are lucky!

410
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,368
You guys are not being punished.

411
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,309
We are being punished.

412
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,642
You guys escape from the city
life and come here to breathe.

413
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,209
Major.. only the person who
is serving a sentence..

414
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,686
..knows the pain of being punished.

415
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,416
That is what l am saying!

416
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,517
You guys are here in this cell.

417
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,458
And we are inside the boundary line.

418
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,355
Both are serving a sentence.

419
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,234
When l had come from Sattar to
Mumbai to join the police force..

420
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,270
..l had thought.. l
will go to Mumbai..

421
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,806
..and lead a comfortable life.

422
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:24,873
What is this!

423
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:30,815
At that time who knew? That this
is the plight of policemen.

424
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:35,281
l have been staying in Mumbai
for the past 3 years..

425
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,787
..but l have still
not seen Ohowpatty.

426
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,291
From here to quarter.
From quarter to here.

427
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:46,296
We have been imprisoned
in this life.

428
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,273
From here.

429
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,485
Look, sir. We have reached
our destination.

430
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:16,924
Look.. liked the place?

431
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,290
lsn't it fabulous?
- Yes.

432
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,761
And my factory is here.

433
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,524
And look there, tall buildings.

434
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:24,829
And this is our workplace.

435
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,733
And yes, from tomorrow don't wear
yellow shirt and black pant. - Why?

436
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,006
People will call you a cab
in Mumbai. Understood.

437
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,809
Why a cab?
- Oome.

438
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,878
And look, this entire
hamlet is ours.

439
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,640
Look this is our factory.

440
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,682
Greetings, Mohammed-bhai.
- Greetings.

441
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,580
l had spoken to you. He is
my friend Sagar Hussain.

442
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:46,017
From today you will spend
your entire day here.

443
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,225
lmdad.
- Yes.

444
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,359
l have been noticing it everyday.

445
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,227
Why do all the workers go inside..

446
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,823
..everyday at this particular time?

447
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:36,273
Eyes get tired of doing
this sewing work.

448
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:37,568
Have they gone to rest?

449
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,540
Not rest, they have gone to
make themselves anxious.

450
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,471
Anxious?

451
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,912
Oome, l will show you too.
- What?

452
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,917
Your eyes will shine
after seeing it.

453
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:51,287
Oome. Oome.
- Let's go.

454
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,290
Today l will show you
the magic. Oome.

455
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,988
Oome, l will show you. Look.

456
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:02,428
She is like Meena Kumari.

457
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,799
Let me see Meena Kumari.

458
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,069
Listen, let me also see it.

459
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,709
You too have come!

460
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,781
l am also a man. Move!

461
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:19,416
Oome! Oome!

462
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,347
Look! lf you saw it for 2 minutes..

463
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,887
..you won't have to wear
specs for 2 years.

464
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,013
Oome on! Look!

465
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,733
Oh God! Oh God!

466
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,106
Oh God after a long time!

467
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,487
Hey! What happened?

468
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,990
Get lost! Scoundrel! Standing here!

469
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,707
What?

470
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:04,481
Actually.. you take a
bath in the morning..

471
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,482
Why? You don't take bath!

472
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,758
No.. l do take a bath.

473
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,430
So what problem do you
have with my bathing?

474
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,658
No..
- What!

475
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,595
That hole.

476
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,495
Hole?
- Yes.

477
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:24,841
There is a hole on the
wall of your flat.

478
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,346
So when you take a bath
in the morning..

479
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,643
..everybody sees you.

480
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:38,422
Who sees me!
- No. The workers of the factory.

481
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:42,050
You all men are scoundrels!
- l..

482
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,755
You sniff a woman staying
alone like a dog.

483
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:46,887
Listen to me.

484
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,091
lf the door is shut, you
make a hole in the wall!

485
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,065
No, l didn't make a hole.
- Get lost!

486
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,494
l will make you naked here itself!

487
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,072
These people don't even allow
a woman to live alone!

488
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,442
They make a hole in the
wall and watch the show!

489
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,554
Hey! Why did you bow down
your head after seeing me?

490
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,454
l am going to have lunch.

491
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,897
Listen! Do you bow down your head
when you go to have lunch?

492
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,426
Fine, tell me one thing.

493
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,961
How long you all have been
peeping in my house?

494
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,040
l don't know. l have been working
here for the past 15 days.

495
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,641
What did you see in these 15 days?

496
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,366
What?

497
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,845
Peeping from the wall.

498
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:38,943
Seeing you take a bath.

499
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,816
The workers were saying that
you have closed the hole.

500
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,089
Yes. Now you too won't
be able to see.

501
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,750
l don't want to see! l am a man!

502
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,490
Still l don't like to see other's
daughter-in-law or wife.

503
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:58,099
Men like to see only other's
daughter-in-law or wife.

504
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,530
By the way l am not anybody's
daughter-in-law or wife.

505
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,705
l am single.

506
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,808
lf you ever feel like it,
then let me know.

507
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,012
l will open the hole for you.

508
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,347
What happened?

509
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,816
Shinde, why do you make a
noise when we are asleep?

510
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,546
My duty has changed.

511
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,281
l am just checking
whether somebody..

512
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,549
..died in the last officer's duty.

513
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,284
Hey! lf nobody died in the
last officer's duty..

514
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,986
..then will you kill during
your duty time?

515
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,298
Go to sleep! Go to sleep!

516
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,864
Now what will l sleep?

517
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,337
Now l will get to sleep
only after death!

518
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,340
Spreading like a virus!

519
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,736
Oome Ohameli, in the garden..

520
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,780
What?
- Nadir sir's meal.

521
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:56,511
Yes, yes! After all doctor has
given special prescription.

522
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:57,849
And even the court has
given the order.

523
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,054
l will have to frisk you.

524
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:02,884
Fine.

525
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,228
Nadir sir, greetings.
- Greetings.

526
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,856
Here is your breakfast.

527
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,236
Nadir sir, anything else?

528
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,935
No.
- Greetings.

529
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:27,710
Sagar.

530
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,346
Oome.

531
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,767
Sit. Sit.

532
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,607
Sit comfortably.

533
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,347
Eat it.

534
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:25,242
Sagar.. when l was outside.. be it
breakfast time or supper time..

535
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:30,780
..somebody would always be with me.

536
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,352
Here there are many people.

537
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:42,917
But everybody is enduring
their sorrow alone.

538
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,355
Drink tea.

539
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,872
Sagar. Stop crying, Sagar.

540
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,285
Since the time l have been caught..

541
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:49,291
..people have only beaten me.

542
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:57,024
Somebody kicked me.
Somebody punched me.

543
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,794
Somebody taunted me.

544
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:09,211
And the remaining people
hit me with their gaze.

545
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:12,612
And they made my body half dead.

546
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,746
l have become just a body.

547
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:28,226
l have received so many
beatings of hatred..

548
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:34,965
..that even a messiah
would have died by now.

549
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,269
But l didn't die.

550
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,346
Am l such a big culprit?

551
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:50,717
That even death would become
impure by touching me.

552
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,296
Look.. if you have done something..

553
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:03,299
..or if you have not done anything..

554
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:08,338
..only you and God know that.

555
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:15,337
lf you have committed a
crime or if you have..

556
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:19,906
..not committed a crime.. still
ask for forgiveness from Him.

557
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:31,419
Sagar.. there is no greater
forgiver than Him.

558
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:35,824
Sir, you are right.

559
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,595
What right!

560
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:44,538
Nadir! Good morning, Nadir!
- Morning.

561
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,109
Having breakfast?

562
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,677
We have already eaten.
The same routine meal.

563
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:56,418
Mr. Nadir.. whether a person
is guilty or innocent..

564
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,818
..there is no difference
in their tears.

565
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,281
Tears don't reveal whether a
person is guilty, innocent..

566
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,654
..honest or dishonest.

567
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:08,729
And he.. he is a monster. Scoundrel!

568
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:14,294
Who are we to decide that?

569
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,472
Have tea.

570
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,773
No.
- l don't want it.

571
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:24,539
Dongre.

572
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,744
Everybody is gathered here!

573
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,546
Strange! Didn't see you
for the past 2 days.

574
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,677
l was on a leave, sir.
- Leave? - Yes.

575
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,415
So you had a leave.

576
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,991
Then you must have drunk at home.

577
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,754
Nothing, sir. l had beer.

578
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:38,954
What are you saying!

579
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,588
Yes, sir. That Shetty of Kalapani.

580
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:42,723
Shetty of Kalapani? Yes!

581
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,857
He told me.

582
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:47,404
To come to meet him when he
is released.. at his bar.

583
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,772
He got released and l got a leave.
Both at the same day.

584
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,703
Then 2 days..

585
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,142
Oold beer in hand and wonderful
sight at the bar.

586
00:41:55,513 --> 00:42:01,474
What an entertainment!

587
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,519
What fun!

588
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,515
l was going there. Then l
remembered l have to go for duty.

589
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,956
Hey! Why are you staring?

590
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:15,922
Haven't you also done all this?

591
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,797
But l did it with bar girls
not with my own daughters!

592
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,654
Orow ran away with the anklets.

593
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:43,090
Orow ran away with the anklets.

594
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:47,493
My ominous beloved didn't wake up.

595
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:54,732
Orow ran away with the nose-ring.

596
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:58,865
My ominous beloved didn't wake up.

597
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,345
What happened? What
are you looking at?

598
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:12,889
Nothing, Major sir. Where does
this water go? - Outside.

599
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,424
ls that so? This water
goes outside? - Yes.

600
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,017
But you had said that nobody
can go out of the prison.

601
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,488
And the water is going
out in front of you.

602
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,826
And you can't do anything.

603
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,991
Get lost!

604
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,564
Hey, Major!
- What!

605
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:29,798
What happened to worshipping time?

606
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,500
No time. We are searching
for a missing prisoner.

607
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:33,632
Understood!

608
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,301
You are wasting your
time searching..

609
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,505
..for somebody who doesn't
want to stay inside.

610
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,707
Keep quiet, virus!

611
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,777
Scoundrel! No food!

612
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,012
And on top of that he
is saying keep quiet!

613
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,021
Spreading like a virus!

614
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:50,921
The prisoner was from which yard?

615
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,937
Help!

616
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,475
ls somebody there?

617
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,506
Help!

618
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:11,672
Jailor sir, he is running
away from the ditch.

619
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,349
Get me out!

620
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,343
Oome here!

621
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,783
One by one get down.

622
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,358

623
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,483
And get him out!

624
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:24,618
Go in! Oome on!

625
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:25,752
Go in! Go in!

Hurry up!

627
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,021
Oome on! - l won't go! My
clothes will be ruined!

628
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,457

629
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:30,658
Get in!

630
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:31,792
You will vomit everything!

631
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:32,926
Get in!

632
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:36,633
From where they escape!

633
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:38,435
God knows how far he must have gone!

634
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:39,599
Bring him back!

635
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:40,732
Don't run away with him! Understood!

636
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:43,671
Now watch the fun!

637
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,411
Hey, use your strength!

638
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:53,951
Oome out! Quickly!

639
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:01,864
Don't beat him!

640
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,489
Hey! Hey!

641
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:05,662
Doctor.

642
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:08,293
So much time has passed away.

643
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,428
The rest will also pass away.

644
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,508
You don't have to wile away time.
You have to live it.

645
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:14,637
Sagar.

646
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,439
Oome.

647
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,349
Sit.

648
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,296
What happened? You had gone
to the court, hadn't you?

649
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,357
Tell me.

650
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,962
Today my elder daughter testified.

651
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:48,339
'When we all would go
to sleep in the night..

652
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:52,347
..then father would come drunk..

653
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,076
..and.. and he would rape me.'

654
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,349
'lf l screamed he would
shut my mouth..

655
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:00,287
..and threaten to kill me.'

656
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,750
'Father has raped all
three of us sisters.'

657
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:09,766
'He has stripped us from
our respect and honour.'

658
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,727
'Our father has degraded us.'

659
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,573
Mr. Nadir, he is a big criminal.

660
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,810
He has raped his daughters.
We feel ashamed to hear it.

661
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,910
No, doctor. l think he is innocent.

662
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:34,582
No, no! Daughters will never insult
their father like this.

663
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:35,783
They will never accuse him.

664
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,358
Mr. Nadir, l have kept
your breakfast.

665
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:38,951
l am in a hurry today.

666
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:40,755
There is a program in the prison.

667
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:42,355
What is that?

668
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:46,027
This is your last night with us.

669
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,224
This is your last night with us.

670
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:12,853
This is your last night with us.

671
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:16,763
From tomorrow you are
no longer a prisoner.

672
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,831
From tomorrow you are
no longer a prisoner.

673
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:27,671
No bondages and Major's squabble.

674
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:31,339
No bondages and Major's squabble.

675
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:34,884
Tomorrow you are going to leave.

676
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,417
Tomorrow you are going to leave.

677
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,620
What all things he
will do outside!

678
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:49,631
What all things he
will do outside!

679
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:53,430
This is your last night with us.

680
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:11,353
He will eat sweets.

681
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:15,282
He will lock eyes with
sister-in-law.

682
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,953
He will switch off the light
in the evening itself.

683
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:22,623
He will switch off the light
in the evening itself.

684
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:26,430
There no Major will
come to wake you up.

685
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,233
This is called Shri Balaji's
mother-in-law!

686
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:31,636
Shri Balaji's mother-in-law!

687
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,403
Shri Balaji's mother-in-law!

688
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,273
Shri Balaji's mother-in-law!

689
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:36,971
Shri Balaji's mother-in-law!

690
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,741
Shri Balaji's mother-in-law!

691
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,283
Shri Balaji's mother-in-law!

692
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:54,791
From tomorrow your lifestyle
will change.

693
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:59,434
He will take bribe
to buy intoxicants.

694
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:02,664
There will be no problem.

695
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:06,537
Outside he will drink to
his heart's content.

696
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:10,340
Outside he will drink to
his heart's content.

697
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,541
Drunkard, dance and sway.

698
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:17,279
Drunkard, dance and sway.

699
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:20,754
The policeman will
not go for a leave.

700
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:24,452
The policeman will
not go for a leave.

701

Say LA1 , LA2. Forgot
Naigoan, Worli?

702
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,233
That is what l am saying.

703
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,828
LA1 , LA2 will not go for a leave.

704
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,670
They will not make us
sit idle for sorting.

705
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:44,509
He will not make his family crave.

706
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:50,416
He will not make his family crave.

707
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:55,753
He has got lucky.

708
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:59,351
He has got lucky.

709
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:02,899
He has got lucky.

710
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,631
He has got lucky.

711
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,433
This is your last night with us.

712
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:13,873
This is your last night with us.

713
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:17,911
From tomorrow you are
no longer a prisoner.

714
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:24,782
From tomorrow you are
no longer a prisoner.

715
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:28,722
No bondages and Major's squabble.

716
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:32,352
Tomorrow you are going to leave.

717
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,659
What all things he
will do outside!

718
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:39,725
What all things he
will do outside!

719
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,528
What happened to him?

720
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:56,676
l will meet my daughter
after a long time.

721
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:59,688
When she will ask
me where you were?

722
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,657
What will l tell her?

723
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,695
Why are you getting emotional?

724
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:12,425
l have thought that
l will earn money.

725
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:18,406
l will enrol my daughter in
an English medium school.

726
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:21,033
l will enrol her.

727
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,845
l will enrol her.

728
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:26,415
Will you take extortion
money for the donation?

729
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,040
Hey, Amitabh Bachchan.

730
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:30,579
Don't give a speech.

731
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,348
Don't give a speech.

732
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:34,014
Don't give a speech.

733
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,853
Don't give a speech.

734
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:37,654
Don't give a speech.

735
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,729
Don't give a speech.

736
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,027
This is your last night with us.

737
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:46,796
This is your last night with us.

738
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,697
From tomorrow you are
no longer a prisoner.

739
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,872
From tomorrow you are
no longer a prisoner.

740
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:01,508
No bondages and Major's squabble.

741
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:05,019
Tomorrow you are going to leave.

742
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:08,687
What all things he
will do outside!

743
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:09,822
What all things he
will do outside!

744
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:27,342
Oome, old man. Today l will
rejuvenate your eyes.

745
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:28,536
Oome.

746
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,404
Oome on! Go inside!

747
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:36,714
Who will go inside?

748
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,946
Hey! Oome ahead! You!

749
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,959
Listen.. l will prescribe
some medicine.

750
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,923
Take the white pill in the morning.

751
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:51,957
Take the yellow pill
in the afternoon.

752
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,493
And in the evening..

753
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,571
Take the blue pill before
going to sleep.

754
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,599
You doctors!

755
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:01,233
No matter what the ailment is..
you give the same three pills!

756
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:04,339
Tell me one thing honestly.

757
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:08,277
Are these pills really genuine..

758
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,616
..or you are fooling everybody?

759
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:13,847
Am l the doctor or
you are the doctor?

760
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,615
Do l have to take the pills
or you have to take it?

761
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,289
The reason of the ulcer
in my stomach..

762
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,885
..is the food and medicine
of this place.

763
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:24,433
lf l had any other pill, my
ulcer will lead to cancer.

764
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,434
l don't want your medicine!

765
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:28,626
Doctor will give me the medicine!

766
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,569
Next!
- The same medicine! The same pill!

767
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:32,642
The same pill for every ailment!

768
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,607
What a prison!
- What happened to you?

769
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,043
Nothing, doctor. l am fine.

770
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:40,348
But if nothing will happen,
then there will be problem.

771
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:41,610
What is going on?

772
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,949
The meal that l get here,
l don't eat that meal.

773
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,488
ln fact that meal is eating me.

774
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,354
And if you really want me
to live then please..

775
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:52,690
..prescribe milk and bread for me.

776
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,093
This is a prison not a poultry farm.

777
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:58,566
Doctor, l am an officer's son.
And my father is very wealthy.

778
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,295
You will prescribe milk for me.

779
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:03,463
And my father will send the
money for milk at your place.

780
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,507
Sorry. l can't do this.

781
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:06,667
You will become rich.

782
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,472
lt will be government's milk and
you will receive the payment.

783
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,513
That too double the market price.

784
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,776
Please. l belong to
a well to do family.

785
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:21,717
Let me see it.

786
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,507
Hey, you!

787
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,583
Nab him! Otherwise he
will create a problem!

788
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:51,717
Oh God! Oh God! Save me!

789
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:55,689
ls somebody there! Save
me! Oh God! Save me!

790
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,089
Leave me! You scoundrel!

791
00:54:57,193 --> 00:55:00,287
Save me! Leave me! Leave me!

792
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:06,363
Are you hurt?

793
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,438
No! But right now you
are touching me!

794
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:12,235
This is the plight during daytime!

795
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,673
l don't know what will happen
during the night!

796
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,276
What has still not
happened with us..

797
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,348
..l think it will happen now!

798
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:20,473
Yes!

799
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,347
All the prisoners are scoundrels!

800
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:24,477
Yes!

801
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:27,420
Go and do something
for these prisoners!

802
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:28,616
Major.
- What?

803
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,354
l have to go to the doctor.

804
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:32,655
Why? What happened?

805
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,560
There is a burning sensation
at my genital area.

806
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,361
lt feels as if it's on fire.

807
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:39,594
ls that so?
- Yes.

808
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:42,337
So you too have started getting..

809
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:43,997
..a burning sensation
at your genital area.

810
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:47,769
What do you mean?

811
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:50,976
l mean l can't leave this yard.

812
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,746
Go to the doctor when the next
shift constable will come.

813
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,408
You have a burning sensation.

814
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:04,821
Hey! Why did Major say this?

815
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,228
l don't have any other problem.

816
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:09,355
Oome here.

817
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:10,524
What other problem?

818
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:13,693
What do you think? You have
syphilis or gonorrhoea?

819
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,229
This is the result of
asafoetida that..

820
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,967
..is added abundantly in the food.

821
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,299
Look, right now the burning sensation
is in the front part, right?

822
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:22,604
Yes.

823
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,703
After 3 days, it will
be on the back side.

824
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,348
After that, the burning sensation
will be on both the sides.

825
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:29,475
Oh!

826
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:31,281
After that everything
will cool down!

827
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,687
ls this asafoetida so dangerous?

828
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:37,282
Danger! lf you gave it to a lion..

829
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:40,295
..it will meow like
a cat for a month.

830
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:42,358
The race horse will
be out from the race.

831
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:45,923
Asafoetida has ruined many people.

832
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:47,297
Oh God!

833
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:50,338
They have spread like
a virus! Let's go.

834
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,429
Bhai.
- Yes.

835
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,563
Tell me something.

836
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:56,605
This Parsi guy asks everybody
what crime have you committed.

837
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:59,614
Now tell me. What crime
has he committed?

838
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,206
You don't know?
- No.

839
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:02,375
He was a judge.

840
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:03,884
He is in prison for being corrupt.

841
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,412
Have your tea.

842
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:14,219
As soon as l touched
both her cheeks..

843
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:19,358
..l felt as if my hands
have touched flowers.

844
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,362
A bit manly.

845
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:23,567
A bit feminine.

846
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:27,435
Tonight she will come in my
dreams.. and she will tickle me.

847
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:28,738
Now you guys go! Go!

848
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:30,979
l will go to sleep.

849
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:37,615
1 .. 2.. 3.. 4.

850
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,948
Hey! Don't want to come! Oome on!

851
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,604
'Mother!'

852
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:42,608
'Mother!'

853
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:45,752
You shove the policeman!

854
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,550
Scoundrel! Oome on!

855
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:49,687
Lock him up!
- Lock him up!

856
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:58,893
'Oover your head. And
quietly come with me.'

857
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:00,899
'Don't look at anybody.'

858
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,430
'And don't say anything to anybody.'

859
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:16,275
No father.

860
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,344
No father.

861
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:29,697
lf all 4 of you don't listen
to me, l will kill you all!

862
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,360
He is not our father,
he is an animal.

863
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:38,235
He raped us, slept with
us by using force..

864
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:42,777
..by abusing us, by gagging
us with the veil.

865
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:47,946
We considered him as
our father, and he.

866
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:52,883
He considered us a woman
and kept raping us.

867
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,289
lf we will open our mouth
he will kill us..

868
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:58,883
..with that thought
we only kept crying.

869
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:01,289
Quietly, like a living corpse.

870
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,294
But when he tried to force
younger sister Rubina..

871
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,962
..we could not keep quiet anymore
we broke our silence.

872
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:15,310
We are afraid to see his face.

873
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:47,406
Your Honour, by seeing the
condition of this child..

874
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,501
..the court must have realised how

875
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:53,546
brutally she must have been raped.

876
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:58,417
A child that grows under the
protection of her father..

877
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:01,888
..that child is afraid
to see her father.

878
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:06,293
Your Honour l think, questioning
this child any more..

879
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:09,888
..would be making this
child cry more.

880
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:14,493
Next witness.

881
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:19,365
Your honour, my next witness
is Mr. Vijay Amre.

882
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:21,340
Please, Mr. Amre.

883
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:31,419
Your Honour, Mr. Amre
is a social worker..

884
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:35,355
..he is respected a lot in Mumbra
and people trust him.

885
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:39,957
Mr. Amre, what do you know
about Sagar Hussain?

886
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:43,430
You Honour, considering
Sagar Hussain a human..

887
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,763
..is an insult to human kind.

888
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:51,403
ln our society, mother, sister,
daughter, daughter-in-law..

889
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:55,500
..these are the forms of a
woman that are worshiped.

890
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:58,613
But this man has put a stigma on it.

891
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:03,541
Your Honour, l don't have any
personal enmity with Sagar Hussain.

892
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:07,287
One day sister Sabina came to me..

893
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:11,349
..and she told me that this person..

894
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,692
..has been raping his daughters
for the past 8 years.

895
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:20,564
l was shocked to hear that.

896
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,566
l could not sleep for 2 days.

897
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:27,702
l tried to explain
to him, but he beat

898
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,810
me up and threw me out of the house.

899
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,078
Your Honour as a social worker
l could not keep quiet.

900
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:40,344
l took sister Sabina and the
children to the police station..

901
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:44,085
..lodged a complaint against him
and.. and he was arrested.

902
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,684
Thank you your Honour.

903
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,764
Mr. Verma, you may call
your next witness.

904
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:54,363
Your Honour, my last witness
is Mrs. Sagar Hussain..

905
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:58,964
..but l don't think that court
needs her testimony.

906
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:02,942
No Mr. Verma, she is the
key witness in this case.

907
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,738
The court will hear her testimony
on the next date.

908
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:07,406
My last witness is Miss..

909
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,618
Keep quiet! Why are you shouting?

910
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:21,894
Do you want to wake everyone up?

911
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:27,559
He does not keep quiet! Keep quiet
or l will break your head.

912
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:34,633
Break it! Break it! Break
it! Break it! Break it!

913
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:46,813
Why did you injure your head?

914
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:54,087
l have a burden that l
cannot carry anymore.

915
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,357
You could have also died this way.

916
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:01,569
But l am not dying.

917
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:05,297
The more l get beaten up,
the more l live.

918
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:10,344
The fool doesn't know that you
cannot break bars with your head..

919
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:11,470
..you break your head with the bar.

920
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:14,281
They are spread all over like virus.

921
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:26,019
Did you see Nadir, he
is repenting it now.

922
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:32,297
Orime itself punishes
the culprit, it does.

923
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,359
Now nothing can happen..

924
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:38,030
..now he doesn't have any other
way but to bang his head.

925
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,363
He doesn't have any other way.

926
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:41,910
Visitor, Sagar Hussain!

927
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,497
l am going but
why are you glowering?

928
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:19,538
Greetings.

929
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,276
They are Orime Branch officers..

930
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:23,409
..they have come to interrogate you.

931
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:28,483
Now why do you want to
interrogate me sir.

932
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:33,284
When l was caught, you took
me on remand for 21 days..

933
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:34,886
..and had asked so many questions.

934
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:37,363
You beat me up so much, remember.

935
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,828
Where are the goods?
- Which goods.

936
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:41,428
Do you recognise this letter?

937
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:48,342
l had written this letter to my
wife, you did not post it still.

938
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:50,311
This letter was sent to the police..

939
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,347
..because we had doubts
regarding its content.

940
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:57,608
Sir, l won't write a love
letter at this age.

941
01:05:57,853 --> 01:05:59,343
What is a bundle of
yellow food grain..

942
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,286
..that you have hidden
in the fields.

943
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:04,893
lt is the same gold that you had
stolen in Junagadh, isn't it?

944
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:07,895
Gold? - You think that the Mumbai
crime branch is full of fools.

945
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:10,557
You will write in code,
and we won't understand!

946
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:14,628
We ploughed your entire field,
but we could not find the gold.

947
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:15,826
Where is the gold?

948
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:19,240
You ploughed my entire field.

949
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,844
Lord Jalaram, it is all because
of your blessings.

950
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,410
Thank you very much sir.

951
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:30,351
The thing is that sir..

952
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:35,823
..last month my wife
had come to meet me.

953
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,424
She said she does not have money
to have the fields ploughed.

954
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,898
lf the fields are not ploughed,
the children will die of hunger.

955
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,902
Then l used my wit.

956
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:52,300
l knew thatjailor sir
will read my letter..

957
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,375
..will have it investigated.

958
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:58,405
And will plough my entire field
in the greed of the gold.

959
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,284
Why you..
- Mind your language sir.

960
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:05,216
Right now l am not
in police custody..

961
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:07,346
..l am in jail custody,
isn't it sir.

962
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:09,415
First of all..

963
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,755
..you are interrogating me without
the courts permission.

964
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:15,226
lf l will tell everything
to the judge..

965
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:17,629
..then yourjobs will be in trouble.

966
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:22,971
You did one good thing,
you ploughed my field.

967
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:30,538
Oome on, the senior is coming
on an inspection!

968
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,873
The senior is coming on
an inspection! Go in!

969
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:34,745
Don't tell me when
you get beaten up!

970
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:35,874
Doesn't even let us breathe freely.

971
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:38,613
They just let us out, and already
they want us to go in.

972
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,279
They are spread all over like virus.

973
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:42,682
Let it be, why are you
boring me. Oome on.

974
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:45,488
Go, go. - You go in your virus
infected cell, l am going.

975
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:47,757
Bye.
- Bye.

976
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:03,209
Nadir sir, please read this.

977
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,338
What is this?

978
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:10,479
lt is something that l have
written, but l cannot say it.

979
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:14,807
Sagar, keep seated.

980
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:19,882
Look, l have read what
you have gone through.

981
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:24,722
l have written this letter,
give it to your lawyer.

982
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:28,829
My lawyer does not
come to the court.

983
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:29,955
Why?

984
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,233
He had asked for 25,000 as advance..

985
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:36,566
..but lmdad could give
him only 5,000.

986
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,567
Then who handles your case?

987
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,434
Apte, his assistant.

988
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:47,678
Look, don't worry you request the
judge he will call you lawyer.

989
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:50,285
But there is one thing..

990
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:54,413
..this letter should reach
your lawyer anyhow.

991
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:55,747
Okay.

992
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,291
Your Honour, because of
some personal problems..

993
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:03,957
..my client could not come
to the court today.

994
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:08,433
l request to the court to grant
her permission till tomorrow.

996
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:14,831
Yes.

01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:27,012
Your lawyer..
- Mr. Ravi Vishnoi.

1000
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:31,620
But, we have Mr. Apte's
lawyer certificate.

01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:34,418
No, my lawyer is Mr. Ravi Vishnoi.

01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:39,898
Escorting let him meet
Mr. Ravi Vishnoi.

1003
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,427
Please call him here Judge ma'am..

1004
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:46,871
..they are always in a hurry
to take me to jail.

1005
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,805
They will take me to
the jail directly.

1006
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:57,613
Okay, tell him that
l want to meet him.

1007
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:03,619
Madam you called me.

01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,558
My client.
- Sagar Hussain.

l don't know any Sagar Hussain.

1011
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:18,766
What is this case?

1012
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,834
This is a case of 307 and 376.

1013
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:25,808
This man has raped his
three daughters.

1014
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:29,943
Not only the accusations, but his
crimes have been proven too.

1015
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,352
Only one witness remains and
l have even told madam..

1016
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,888
..that there is no need
for that witness.

1017
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:42,359
Ma'am, a lawyer fights either
for fame for fortune..

1018
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:46,560
..but in this case..
- You won't get anything.

1019
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:47,693
lnstead you will lose everything..

1020
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:49,963
..you have earned till now
and your career too.

1021
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:53,540
There is nothing left in this its
all over, he cannot be saved.

1022
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:57,010
Sorry ma'am, l will
not fight this case.

1023
01:11:57,846 --> 01:11:59,609
l have not asked you
to fight the case.

1024
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:04,476
l have called you here on the
clients request, meet him once.

1025
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:06,611
Okay.

01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,624
Sir, he is Sagar Hussain sir.

1029
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:21,302
Sir, he wanted you to fight his
case, but he did not have money.

1030
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:23,428
So l did not let him come to you.

1031
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:25,767
This should never happen again.
- Sorry sir.

1032
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:29,942
And you, l am not
fighting your case!

1033
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:32,810
And never ever take my name
in this court again.

1034
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:34,881
Sir, l will give you the money.

1035
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:36,678
Quiet. - Who is he?

1036
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:39,948
He, he, he finances him sir.

1037
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:43,684
Sir, you don't fight my case
but please read this letter.

1038
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:45,350
When l am not fighting your case..

01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:46,485
..why should l read this letter.

1040
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:50,827
On human grounds.
- On human grounds.

1041
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,434
You are talking about humanity,
it doesn't sound good.

1042
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,470
lt gets insulted.

1043
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:59,404
For the sake of humanity.
Apte, take care of him.

1044
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:01,339
Take him.
- What is this misbehaviour?

1045
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:02,432
Please read it.

1046
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:09,276
Nothing will happen.

1047
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,882
Nadir sir, nothing can happen.

1048
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:14,285
Sagar, when nothing happens..

1049
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:18,486
..then think that a lot of
things are going to happen.

1050
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:22,419
Have faith in Allah, Sagar.

1051
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,760
Sagar Hussain, meeting.

1052
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:05,271
Nadir sir.
- Oome Sagar, sit.

1053
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:07,740
Mr. Vishnoi is ready
to fight my case.

1054
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:11,742
Whether he gets money or not,
this is all because of you.

1055
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:13,338
Sit.

1056
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:20,486
Look, l did not do anything,
this is all Allah's blessing.

1057
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:28,285
Tell me one thing, why didn't
you tell me all this earlier.

1058
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:34,300
lt was not important earlier.
- And now.

1059
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:37,296
Now it has become very important.

1060
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:41,942
lmdad had come to meet me.

1061
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:45,737
Listen, you stupid people!

1062
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:47,406
l will jump from the tree
and give up my life.

1063
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:48,744
l will commit suicide!

1064
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:52,754
Ohandu, don't be mad!
Oome down! Oome down!

1065
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:55,881
Shut up! You people have made
me rot in jail for three years.

1066
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:57,424
And you say that don't be mad?

1067
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:58,754
What? What is my crime?

1068
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:01,356
Just this much that for
my mother's sake..

1069
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:04,022
..l did not allow my
father to remarry?

1070
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,634
You people say thatjail
is to reform a person.

1071
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:08,733
But you kept me amidst
the criminals..

1072
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:09,997
..and you have made me wayward.

1073
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:11,402
Hey, come down!

1074
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:13,397
We will go and tell Jailor sir.

1075
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:16,076
And then he will release
you. Understood?

1076
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,475
You think l am a fool?

1077
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:20,007
On your saying the Jailor
will release me?

1078
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:23,150
Go and tell the Jailor
to fix the date for me.

1079
01:15:23,585 --> 01:15:26,418
When he is ready to fix the date,
then only l will come down.

1080
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:27,679
Hey, you come down.

1081
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,680
Otherwise, there will be one more
case charged against you.

1082
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:30,815
And your punishment
will be extended..

1083
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:31,950
..for another six months.
Understood?

1084
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:34,892
Let it be! How much will be
the punishment for my crime?

1085
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,463
At the most six months?

1086
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:37,998
And if they charge
a case against me.

1087
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,089
Then six months more!

1088
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:40,462
Total one year!

1089
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:41,558
But l am rotting here for
the past three years.

1090
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:43,804
You go and do what you want;
l will not come down.

1091
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,939
First you go and fix my date
then l will come down.

1092
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,065
We will see how you don't come down?

1093
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,540
No, l will not come down.
- You go and get a ladder.

1094
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:50,009
lt has spread like virus.

1095
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:51,803
Did you see, doctor sir..

1096
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:55,016
This is one whose date
does not get fixed.

1097
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:58,419
And he is the other one, whose
decision will be given..

1098
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,078
..in a month's time.

1099
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:01,678
His wife is the last witness!

1100
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:04,952
Mrs. Sabina Sagar Hussain!

1101
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:09,497
Madam Judge, l object to the way
l am addressed by the lawyer.

1102
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:13,130
l do not want to have any
relation with that man.

1103
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:16,404
So much so, that l would
not want his name..

1104
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:18,530
..to be attached to my name.

1105
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:23,001
l should be called by my
name as Sabina Begum.

1106
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:28,616
But.. by your saying the reality
is not going to change.

1107
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:32,413
Okay, if you want it that way,
then to keep your respect..

1108
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:35,820
..l will address you
by your name only.

1109
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:38,549
Boss, the female is gorgeous!

1110
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:42,757
You fool, she is a whore and
that too an expensive one.

1111
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:44,430
Understood!

1112
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:47,091
Okay so, Sabina Begum..

1113
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:51,071
The statement that you have
given to the police.

1114
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:58,411
That the accused has raped
your three daughters

1115
01:16:58,714 --> 01:16:59,738
ls it the truth?

1116
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:03,875
Unfortunately it is the truth!

1117
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:09,814
Oan you tell the court, what you
know regarding this matter?

1118
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,359
Lawyer sir, l will definitely
tell the court.

1119
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:17,365
A man is the respect and honor
and everything to a woman.

1120
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:22,666
lt is this man who gives a lady
respect in the society.

1121
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:26,597
lf a lady is the earth,
then the man is her sky.

1122
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:30,409
The moment a lady goes into
the arms of her man..

1123
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:32,002
..she forgets all her sorrows.

1124
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:37,417
Only that woman knows how
humiliating it is for her to talk..

1125
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:42,957
..against her husband, who
is experiencing all this.

1126
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:47,394
This person who is sitting
in the witness box..

1127
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,963
..was once upon a time my husband.

1128
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:52,759
But today he is not a human
being, he is a devil.

1129
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:58,997
He not only ruined my life, but
also the lives of my daughters.

1130
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:06,476
A husband and a father is a
protection for his wife and children.

1131
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:11,350
When he is at home, there
is a sense of peace..

1132
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:13,421
..and protection in the house.

1133
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:17,357
But the moment he used to enter
the house, we used to feel..

1134
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,620
..as if some terrorist has
come into our house.

1135
01:18:20,962 --> 01:18:23,954
The whole house used to become
restless and worried.

1136
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:27,900
My daughters used to get nervous.

1137
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,664
They would search for a place
in the house to hide.

1138
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:35,803
Because of this shameless fellow
we cannot face anyone.

1139
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:38,871
We have lost our self respect.

1140
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:41,677
lf this is what a father is?

1141
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:45,745
Then l pray to God, that no
father should be alive.

1142
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,750
Because instead of having such
a mean and a scoundrel father.

1143
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:51,086
lt is better that they
don't have one!

1144
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,760
Boss, what she is saying is right.

1145
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:58,662
Keep quiet! Don't get influenced
by her words.

1146
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,928
Just see what happens further.

1147
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:06,066
Your witness, please!
- Yes.

1148
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:12,346
May God never give
such a heartless..

1149
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:13,744
..father or a husband to anyone.

1150
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:16,547
He is not a human being;
he is an animal.

1151
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:20,351
And it is so sorrowful that a wife
has to stand in the court..

1152
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:24,687
..and confess all the
secrets of her husband.

1153
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:26,556
lt is a very sad thing. lsn't it?

1154
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:30,358
Sabina Begum, do you know
any person by the name..

1155
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:31,625
..of Rehmat Sheikh?

1156
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:35,464
What? No.. .

1157
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:41,133
..No!
- Okay!

1158
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:47,679
And do you know Sajid Ali and
his wife Saira from Lucknow?

1159
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:51,886
No! No! No!
- Never mind.

1160
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:55,545
Now l will ask you a
very simple question.

1161
01:19:56,725 --> 01:20:00,889
Were you married before you
married Sagar Hussain?

1162
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,727
l did not understand?

1163
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:08,368
What is there in this that
you do not understand?

1164
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:13,465
What l want to say is
that were you married..

1165
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:18,740
..before you married Sagar Hussain.
Yes or no. - Yes!

1166
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:20,742
That's all, Your Honor!

1167
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,410
Sabina Begum was already married..

1168
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:29,479
..when she was marrying my client,
Sagar Hussain. Yes.

1169
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:32,416
Her first husband's name
is Rehamat Sheikh.

1170
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:35,954
And coincidentally that person
is present in the court today.

1171
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,557
Please sit down.

1172
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,936
And this is their marriage
certificate.

1173
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,736
They both had a daughter too.

1174
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:53,005
Her name is Saila. And this
is Saila's birth certificate.

1175
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:55,072
Please show this to madam Judge.

1176
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:56,610
lt will be a favor on us.

1177
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:08,355
Till Bano's birth, they both kept
Sagar Hussain in the dark..

1178
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:13,399
..they did not tell him
that she was married..

1179
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:15,662
..and that they had a daughter.

1180
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:21,735
Sabina!
- Yes!

1181
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:23,674
She has got into the habit
of roaming outside.

1182
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:25,874
l will just take her
out for a stroll.

1183
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:27,878
Yes! Okay! Okay!

1184
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:30,607
Oome on; dear we will go out. l
will take you out for a stroll.

1185
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:31,743
Keep this milk.

1186
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:37,417
Oome; come on out! My dear
will go out for a stroll.

1187
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:39,627
Look here; now you don't cry here.

1188
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:41,661
See there is a cool wind blowing.

1189
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:44,693
Everything is open! My child is
very good! My child is very good.

1190
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,733
Sister, please listen! Sister!
- Yes!

1191
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:47,927
Where does Sabina stay?

1192
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:49,799
She stays there!
- Thank you!

1193
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:54,065
Who is that?

1194
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:00,072
Okay! So here you are
enjoying your life?

1195
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:03,348
Are you forced into this, or are
you doing business at your will?

1196
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:05,881
Mind your language!

1197
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:07,851
You are teaching me how to talk?

1198
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:10,356
You wretched lady! You
change husbands..

1199
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:11,550
..as you change your clothes.

1200
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:14,660
To talk with you respectfully means
it is an insult of respect.

1201
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,357
Hey you! Just get out of here!

1202
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:20,834
l myself feel degraded to
stand in front of you.

1203
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:24,401
This child, whom you
gave birth and..

1204
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:26,064
..left her with me and went away.

1205
01:22:26,908 --> 01:22:29,399
l have come here to give
you your child back.

1206
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:33,477
Why? ls she not your child?

1207
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:36,148
Am l the only one responsible
for her birth?

1208
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:40,912
We conceived her together!

1209
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:43,022
You were enjoying being my husband.

1210
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:47,461
And now that you have to
look after the child..

1211
01:22:47,562 --> 01:22:49,553
..you have given up?

1212
01:22:50,098 --> 01:22:51,895
Oome on! Go away from here!

1213
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:53,865
Otherwise, l will shout and
gather all the people.

1214
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:55,865
And the people will break your head.

1215
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:59,905
And listen! Now l am
no more your wife.

1216
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:03,342
l may do prostitution or
l become a mistress..

1217
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:05,413
..you do not come and
cry on my grave.

1218
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,338
Now just get lost from here!

1219
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,608
l say get out, you jerk!

1220
01:23:10,051 --> 01:23:14,351
Get lost from here! And don't ever
show your face to me again.

1221
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:15,955
They come to ruin my life!

1222
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:00,064
Oome, my dear! Oome inside!

1223
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:14,081
Sabina, we will take
care of this child.

1224
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:20,947
From today we are her
father and mother.

1225
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:32,728
My Lord. l will just say this..

1226
01:24:32,934 --> 01:24:35,994
What is the relation of
all this with rape?

1227
01:24:37,172 --> 01:24:40,403
All this is related to this. l
will just prove it, Your Honor.

1228
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:41,600
Please have a seat!

1229
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:49,881
This is the xerox copy of the
statement of her credit cards.

1230
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:53,817
These are the bills
of her mobile phones.

1231
01:24:56,458 --> 01:25:00,360
And this is.. there is a fifteen
storey building in Ohembur.

1232
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:06,132
Where she had purchased a five
bedroom flat three years ago.

1233
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:09,664
These are the documents. Please
give them to Madam Judge.

1234
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:17,468
And her expensive dress, her
jewellery, these personals..

1235
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:19,740
..and the expensive perfumes.

1236
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:22,413
The income that she had shown..

1237
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:24,485
..all this does not match with that.

1238
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:27,416
So, Sabina Begum! From
which business..

1239
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:29,080
..did you derive this money?

1240
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:31,419
ln your statement
you had said that..

1241
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:33,551
..you stay in a rental flat.

1242
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,554
You do not even have
a phone at home.

1243
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:37,961
But here all the matter
is the other way round.

1244
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:42,528
Wow! Wow! Very good! Very good!

1245
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:47,467
You have proved your client
innocent in just five minutes.

1246
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:49,872
l have not understood
what you want to say?

1247
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,468
The same way l too have
not understood..

1248
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:53,604
..what you want to prove?

1249
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:58,676
May be what you have said
about Sabina Begum is true.

1250
01:25:59,187 --> 01:26:06,423
But what is the relation of
that matter with this case?

1251
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:08,362
Yes, Mr. Vishnoi; what is the
relation of these things..

1252
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:10,794
..with this case?

1253
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:12,498
There is some relation, madam Judge!

1254
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:15,129
ln the world whenever there
is crime committed.

1255
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:17,370
There.. there is no defence lawyer..

1256
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:20,804
..neither there is a public
prosecutor present there.

1257
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:22,570
Neither there is a judge
present there.

1258
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:25,409
We lawyers with our evidence
and proof establish..

1259
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:29,074
..the character of the criminal
or the witness.

1260
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:32,476
Today even l want to portray
this woman's character..

1261
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:33,611
..in front of you.

1262
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:36,488
This lady did not tell
her second husband..

1263
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:38,957
..about her first marriage.

1264
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:42,462
l asked her three questions.

1265
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:45,499
She gave me false answers
to two of my questions.

1266
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:48,668
That means this lady
is a two-timer liar.

1267
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:53,407
Your Honor, when a
man goes wayward..

1268
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:56,875
..then only a part of the
society is disturbed.

1269
01:26:57,845 --> 01:26:59,472
But when a woman goes wayward..

1270
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:01,742
..then the whole society
gets spoilt.

1271
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:07,021
Because God has given women
the power to conceive.

1272
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:09,013
When a woman goes wayward..

1273
01:27:09,123 --> 01:27:10,488
..then the coming generation
goes wayward.

1274
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:14,754
And this.. she too is
a characterless woman.

1275
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:19,397
She married the second time
without taking divorce..

1276
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,660
..from the first husband.

1277
01:27:21,102 --> 01:27:25,664
No law, or society or religion
gives you that right.

1278
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:29,408
l do not know whether
Sagar Hussain..

1279
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:30,875
..has raped his daughters or not.

1280
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:34,413
But l know this much that
this lady has been raping..

1281
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:37,609
..Sagar Hussain continuously
for the past 20 years.

1282
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:47,360
Lawyer sir, you too are
trying to punish us?

1283
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:49,756
We are poor!

1284
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:56,131
And to be poor is the world's
biggest helplessness.

1285
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:00,471
You are not aware of my state.

1286
01:28:01,509 --> 01:28:05,741
Helplessness makes us compromise
with so many things.

1287
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:09,341
lf you do not talk lovingly
to the shop keeper..

1288
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:12,351
..then you do not get
the food grains.

1289
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:14,351
lf you do not be polite
with the milkman..

1290
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:17,015
..then he brings up old accounts.

1291
01:28:17,725 --> 01:28:22,025
l have to sell myself give up
myself in every step of life.

1292
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:28,460
Only after that my children
and l get food to eat.

1293
01:28:30,772 --> 01:28:32,740
Boss, that poor lady
is saying the truth.

1294
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:36,401
Hey fool! She is accepting
to her being a whore.

1295
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:41,412
Did Sagar Hussain rape his
stepdaughter, Saila too?

1296
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:47,411
Your Honor, this means
that Sagar Hussain..

1297
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:53,017
..must be accused for raping not
three daughters, but four daughters.

1298
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:57,564
Saila Wajid Ali too should be
involved in this case. - No!

1299
01:28:57,832 --> 01:29:01,700
No! She was not raped!
- Why?

1300
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:05,404
Why didn't he rape her?
She was his stepdaughter.

1301
01:29:05,973 --> 01:29:07,600
Why don't you ask him that question?

1302
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:10,476
At that time he was
possessed by a devil.

1303
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:14,012
Your Honor! May it be three,
four, two or one.

1304
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:16,845
A rape is a rape! A rape is a rape!

1305
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:20,851
And this criminal should
be punished for that.

1306
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:25,882
This is a good point! The defence
has caught a good point.

1307
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:27,550
Hey keep quiet!

1308
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:33,060
When did you first come
to know about this rape?

1309
01:29:34,902 --> 01:29:36,699
The first day, 8 years back.

1310
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:41,133
When l got up from
sleep in the night.

1311
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:47,004
What happened?

1312
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:49,413
No! Nothing.. nothing..
you go to sleep.

1313
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:04,424
Bano! Bano!

1314
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:27,483
Bano!
- Father!

1315
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:31,683
You are trying to misbehave
with my daughter?

1316
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:37,528
You scoundrel! With my daughter..
- Murder! Murder!

1317
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:38,997
Hey, why are you hitting me?
- What have l done?

1318
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:41,931
She does not come to
me just like that.

1319
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:43,935
She takes money from me;
she takes cash from me.

1320
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:45,402
And the amount of money
that l give her..

1321
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:48,532
..in that much money, l can go and
have fun with any call girl.

1322
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,407
You jerk!

1323
01:31:00,655 --> 01:31:01,679
Where is she?

1324
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:04,353
She has given up shame and virtue.

1325
01:31:07,028 --> 01:31:08,359
What has happened?

1326
01:31:08,496 --> 01:31:10,396
Ask her! What was she doing
with that rickshaw driver?

1327
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:12,557
What was she doing?
- Keep quiet you shameless woman.

1328
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:14,395
What was she doing?

1329
01:31:14,936 --> 01:31:17,131
Bano loves the rickshaw driver.

1330
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:19,402
Do you think of yourself
to be a king..

1331
01:31:19,507 --> 01:31:21,737
..that a prince will come to
ask for your daughters hand?

1332
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:24,406
She will get married to some
driver, rickshaw driver..

1333
01:31:24,512 --> 01:31:28,073
..or someone like
you who sells Zari.

1334
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:34,144
l have myself.. myself chosen
that rickshaw driver for Bano.

1335
01:31:34,922 --> 01:31:36,947
He has his own Rickshaw;
he has his own room.

1336
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:39,488
She has come of age now.

1337
01:31:40,094 --> 01:31:41,425
You could not even give them food..

1338
01:31:41,562 --> 01:31:43,621
..nor clothes to cover their body.

1339
01:31:44,098 --> 01:31:48,501
Beggars should not pose
as egoistic people.

1340
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:53,797
People laugh! They make fun!

1341
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:55,799
Oome, Bano!

1342
01:31:58,813 --> 01:32:02,340
The rickshaw driver Jaffar
and not Sagar Hussain..

1343
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:03,678
..had raped Bano.

1344
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:07,685
This scoundrel will not allow my
daughter to rest in her grave too.

1345
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:12,619
Now she is dead! Please leave her!
Please keep her out of this.

1346
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:17,357
What all accusations are
put on my dead daughter?

1347
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:18,998
What all accusations?

1348
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:20,864
Why doesn't this ground open up?

1349
01:32:20,968 --> 01:32:23,596
Why doesn't the sky
rip apart? Oh my God!

1350
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:26,667
Why don't you give him death, so
that the sins will be less here?

1351
01:32:32,914 --> 01:32:34,472
Oh my God!

1352
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:41,677
Lawyer sir, you too.. you too are
becoming a part of his deeds.

1353
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:44,154
You just give me the answers
to my questions.

1354
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,027
What answers can l give
for made up stories?

1355
01:32:47,161 --> 01:32:49,356
So is this too a made up story
that your daughter, Bano..

1356
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:52,398
..4 years back ran away
with Jaffar by stealing..

1357
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,024
..60,000 rupees from the house.

1358
01:32:54,835 --> 01:32:56,860
No lnspector sir! My daughter
is not like that.

1359
01:32:57,104 --> 01:32:58,401
This scoundrel must have
instigated my daughter..

1360
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:00,872
..and then compelled her
to elope with him.

1361
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:03,070
Give him the most severe punishment.

1362
01:33:03,444 --> 01:33:05,469
And immediately put him behind
bars, lnspector sir!

1363
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,344
Hey, Sagar Hussain; what
your daughter has done..

1364
01:33:08,449 --> 01:33:10,815
..for that she will be punished.

1365
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,817
But why don't you understand?

1366
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:15,879
lf the people in your community..

1367
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:17,423
..come to know about this, then
you and your daughter..

1368
01:33:17,525 --> 01:33:20,426
..will be degraded in
front of everyone.

1369
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:22,023
Then who will marry her?

1370
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:24,957
So it is better that you finish
off the matter here itself.

1371
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:29,934
And the 60,000 that your daughter
had taken and ran away.

1372
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:31,528
Out of that she spent 12,000..

1373
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:34,403
..and the rest we have
recovered 48,000.

1374
01:33:34,508 --> 01:33:35,998
No! No, Sir, l do
not want the money.

1375
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:38,805
You write down the report and
immediately handcuff him.

1376
01:33:39,046 --> 01:33:41,071
And beat him till he dies, sir.

1377
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:42,877
Amre sir, make him understand.

1378
01:33:44,852 --> 01:33:45,876
Have you gone mad?

1379
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:48,344
This is the question
of your daughter.

1380
01:33:48,656 --> 01:33:50,351
What if the people come to
know that your daughter..

1381
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:51,755
..had eloped with a rickshaw
driver, then?

1382
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:54,594
You won't be able to walk
head held high on the road.

1383
01:33:55,029 --> 01:33:57,862
lnspector sir, we do not want
to make any complaint.

1384
01:33:57,965 --> 01:33:59,728
As it is we do not have anything.

1385
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:04,036
Now if our virtue too goes
then we will be nowhere.

1386
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:05,829
Please don't do it!

1387
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:08,609
Your wife is right.

1388
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:10,469
Sagar Hussain, come here!

1389
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:15,346
Sign here, pick up your
money and your daughter..

1390
01:34:15,449 --> 01:34:17,474
..and go away from here.

1391
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:22,088
Now this is no more a made up story.

1392
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:24,356
This receipt is the proof
that Bano had eloped..

1393
01:34:24,458 --> 01:34:27,825
..with Jaffar taking
the money with her.

1394
01:34:29,563 --> 01:34:32,862
There was a police case, and they
had written a complaint too.

1395
01:34:43,577 --> 01:34:49,538
Now Bano is dead! l do not want
to degrade her anymore.

1396
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:52,677
She is in a good place
wherever she is.

1397
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:54,544
Only we are suffering.

1398
01:34:55,456 --> 01:34:57,754
l do not want to make her sad.

1399
01:34:59,727 --> 01:35:01,627
Why don't you understand?

1400
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:04,421
That why she must have
eloped from the house?

1401
01:35:04,565 --> 01:35:06,556
That is what we do not understand?

1402
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:08,066
That why did she run
away from the house?

1403
01:35:08,769 --> 01:35:10,794
Just because of this wicked father!

1404
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:15,540
He was the one who compelled
Bano to take such steps.

1405
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:18,407
He was not getting them married..

1406
01:35:18,512 --> 01:35:20,810
..because he wanted to use them.

1407
01:35:21,682 --> 01:35:23,411
That poor girl, what could
she do besides..

1408
01:35:23,517 --> 01:35:24,541
..running away from the house?

1409
01:35:25,453 --> 01:35:27,011
Tell me one thing, Sabina Begum.

1410
01:35:27,455 --> 01:35:29,423
When you had made
a police complaint.

1411
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:30,683
Then had you written this too?

1412
01:35:31,525 --> 01:35:34,460
That Bano was fed up of the bad
deeds of the wicked father..

1413
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:36,154
..and so she ran away from home?

1414
01:35:36,764 --> 01:35:39,528
Mr. Vaishoi! Sabina Begum
is a simple housewife..

1415
01:35:39,633 --> 01:35:42,534
..and not a lawyer like you,
who can understand..

1416
01:35:42,636 --> 01:35:45,070
..the finest details of the law.

1417
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:48,406
Yes l agree that she made
a grave mistake..

1418
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:54,744
..by not complaining about the
rape done by Sagar Hussain.

1419
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:58,415
But why don't you understand,
that today too..

1420
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:00,350
..this crime is done
on a large extent..

1421
01:36:00,454 --> 01:36:02,684
..but the reporting of
the same is not done.

1422
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,948
At times because of the
prestige of the family.

1423
01:36:05,059 --> 01:36:06,356
Or at times because of fright.

1424
01:36:06,994 --> 01:36:09,428
But that does not mean that
in this particular case..

1425
01:36:09,563 --> 01:36:11,690
..the rape has not taken place.

1426
01:36:11,832 --> 01:36:13,129
The rape has taken place!

1427
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:15,868
And the seriousness of the
crime is very well present.

1428
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:18,400
That is why l request
you Mr. Vishnoi.

1429
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:20,403
That you come to the point
and ask her questions.

1430
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:31,408
Hey Madhubala!

1431
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:16,726
Hey Madhubala!

1432
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:26,406
The crow took away my bindi!

1433
01:37:26,774 --> 01:37:29,868
The crow took away my bindi.

1434
01:37:29,977 --> 01:37:33,811
Then my unfortunate
beloved got up.

1435
01:37:37,785 --> 01:37:41,084
The crow took away my bindi!

1436
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:45,022
Then my unfortunate
beloved got up.

1437
01:37:45,659 --> 01:37:48,753
The crow took away my bindi!

1438
01:37:48,896 --> 01:37:52,662
Then my unfortunate
beloved got up.

1439
01:37:57,037 --> 01:38:00,131
The crow took away my nose ring.

1440
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:03,802
The crow took away my nose ring.

1441
01:38:03,911 --> 01:38:07,813
Then my unfortunate
beloved got up.

1442
01:38:11,652 --> 01:38:15,349
The crow took away my bindi!

1443
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:19,415
Then my unfortunate
beloved got up.

1444
01:38:36,977 --> 01:38:40,140
He was sleeping with
a blanket over him.

1445
01:38:40,547 --> 01:38:43,744
He was engrossed in the
dreams of the mistress.

1446
01:38:48,122 --> 01:38:51,091
He was sleeping with
a blanket over him.

1447
01:38:51,725 --> 01:38:54,956
He was engrossed in the
dreams of the mistress.

1448
01:38:55,629 --> 01:38:58,928
l went on tinkling my anklets
the whole night.

1449
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:02,594
l tried to wake him up all night.

1450
01:39:03,437 --> 01:39:06,463
l went on tinkling my anklets
the whole night.

1451
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:10,003
l tried to wake him up all night.

1452
01:39:14,515 --> 01:39:17,746
The crow took away my anklets.

1453
01:39:18,385 --> 01:39:21,354
The crow took away my anklets.

1454
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:25,414
Then my unfortunate
beloved got up.

1455
01:39:29,029 --> 01:39:32,624
The crow took away my bindi!

1456
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:36,860
Then my unfortunate
beloved got up.

1457
01:39:37,104 --> 01:39:40,073
The crow took away my nose ring.

1458
01:39:40,174 --> 01:39:44,406
Then my unfortunate
beloved got up.

1459
01:40:03,564 --> 01:40:04,861
Hey Madhubala!

1460
01:40:15,142 --> 01:40:22,071
This my full bloomed youth,
was a little ignorant.

1461
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:33,423
This my full bloomed youth,
was a little ignorant.

1462
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:37,158
l was tired of protecting it.

1463
01:40:37,831 --> 01:40:40,823
l gave him my youth.

1464
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:44,664
l was tired of protecting it.

1465
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:49,603
l gave him my youth.

1466
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:56,079
When the crow took me away.

1467
01:40:56,683 --> 01:40:59,743
When the crow took me away.

1468
01:40:59,853 --> 01:41:03,619
Then my unfortunate
beloved got up.

1469
01:41:07,828 --> 01:41:10,888
When the crow took me away.

1470
01:41:11,031 --> 01:41:14,967
Then my unfortunate
beloved got up.

1471
01:41:30,584 --> 01:41:31,949
Hey Madhubala!

1472
01:41:33,787 --> 01:41:35,880
Don't you feel ashamed
to dance in the bar?

1473
01:41:35,989 --> 01:41:37,980
So what? We get the money.

1474
01:41:38,459 --> 01:41:39,892
We have grown up so much.
- What have you given us?

1475
01:41:40,627 --> 01:41:42,822
Not enough to eat, nor
clothes to wear.

1476
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:46,529
What did l give? What did l give?

1477
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:51,393
Just for clothes, you go and
dance in the bar half naked.

1478
01:41:51,705 --> 01:41:54,071
You are not at all worried about
your father's prestige.

1479
01:41:54,174 --> 01:41:57,405
Which prestige? Which prestige
are you talking about?

1480
01:41:57,845 --> 01:42:00,814
lf she does not sing and
dance and earn money.

1481
01:42:00,914 --> 01:42:02,677
Then these three would have
to go without clothes.

1482
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:05,948
First you try and live with respect.

1483
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:09,487
Then you advice others
to live with respect.

1484
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:16,354
These girls must have not
eaten anything till now.

1485
01:42:16,563 --> 01:42:19,088
Oome my dear; we will
eat food. Oome; come.

1486
01:42:19,433 --> 01:42:22,596
Today l have made your
favorite semolina.

1487
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:28,074
Why lawyer sir? ls it
bad to be a bar dancer?

1488
01:42:29,076 --> 01:42:30,543
Or is it against the law?

1489
01:42:30,844 --> 01:42:34,405
lf you would have to go hungry,
then you would..

1490
01:42:34,515 --> 01:42:36,483
..not have asked me this question.

1491
01:42:37,184 --> 01:42:39,414
You would not have asked
me this question..

1492
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,546
..if you would have struggled
to live each moment.

1493
01:42:43,557 --> 01:42:47,618
Sabina Begum, you are a victim
of misunderstanding.

1494
01:42:49,129 --> 01:42:53,793
Even my childhood experienced
poverty.

1495
01:42:55,035 --> 01:42:57,401
We used to stay together
in a 150 sq. feet room..

1496
01:42:57,504 --> 01:43:00,337
..in a ram shackled house,
with my parents..

1497
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:02,874
..and four brothers and sisters.

1498
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:06,813
My father was a nominal clerk
in a Municipal corporation.

1499
01:43:06,914 --> 01:43:08,882
And he did not believe in bribe.

1500
01:43:09,383 --> 01:43:13,410
His salary was so less, that it
was as if you have to try..

1501
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:16,421
..and cover your body with
a small handkerchief.

1502
01:43:17,391 --> 01:43:19,359
The electricity used to
always be disconnected.

1503
01:43:19,826 --> 01:43:21,521
Very often there used to
be no light in the house.

1504
01:43:21,895 --> 01:43:23,362
lt was the favor of the Lord
that the brightness..

1505
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:25,488
..of the street light used
to come inside the house.

1506
01:43:25,832 --> 01:43:27,527
ln that light, l have
completed my education.

1507
01:43:27,935 --> 01:43:31,371
And l did not even do this
that in my college days..

1508
01:43:31,505 --> 01:43:34,406
..go to the gambler's den situated
at the corner of the lane..

1509
01:43:34,508 --> 01:43:36,533
..and do a job there
of selling tickets.

1510
01:43:37,511 --> 01:43:39,479
Madam, a person has to do
such work in which the..

1511
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:41,810
..prestige and honor
should remain intact.

1512
01:43:42,182 --> 01:43:44,412
Each and every person from
the society should learn..

1513
01:43:48,121 --> 01:43:50,021
Should not start doing
immoral deeds.

1514
01:43:51,124 --> 01:43:52,352
We have already received the money.

1515
01:43:52,659 --> 01:43:54,559
After going there, you don't
ask for money. - Yes.

1516
01:43:54,895 --> 01:43:56,362
He is our old customer.

1517
01:43:56,697 --> 01:43:57,891
He is a very big businessman.

1518
01:43:58,165 --> 01:43:59,996
Don't give him a chance to complain.

1519
01:44:00,434 --> 01:44:02,425
And if he tells you to stay
the night, then stay back.

1520
01:44:02,569 --> 01:44:03,593
Yes!
- Okay?

1521
01:44:03,971 --> 01:44:05,939
Driver, take her!
- Oome!

1522
01:44:08,976 --> 01:44:12,468
Oome on, Sabina Begum; l will
show you a new light today.

1523
01:44:37,037 --> 01:44:38,470
Father!

1524
01:44:40,907 --> 01:44:44,673
Put a veil on your head and
quietly come home with me.

1525
01:44:44,845 --> 01:44:48,747
Don't look at anyone, and
don't speak to anyone.

1526
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:54,417
Hey listen! Of you have
finished with her..

1527
01:44:54,521 --> 01:44:56,421
..then leave her with me, so that
l too will finish my work.

1528
01:45:01,561 --> 01:45:05,463
May you rot in hell!
A burden to everyone.

1529
01:45:05,565 --> 01:45:07,499
You are looking at me
with wide open eyes?

1530
01:45:11,838 --> 01:45:13,567
He does not even die!

1531
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:16,408
Just because of this scoundrel
we have to face..

1532
01:45:16,510 --> 01:45:20,071
..so much humiliation..
so much shame.

1533
01:45:20,781 --> 01:45:25,548
Amre sir, you had told us that we
would getjustice in the court.

1534
01:45:25,652 --> 01:45:27,916
ls this what is called justice?

1535
01:45:28,522 --> 01:45:31,491
Here leave alone getting justice..

1536
01:45:31,591 --> 01:45:35,027
..but we are accused
of shameful deeds.

1537
01:45:36,096 --> 01:45:39,623
My child must be restless
in her grave.

1538
01:45:39,833 --> 01:45:42,825
She did not get peace
even after dying.

1539
01:45:44,237 --> 01:45:49,539
Madam Judge, you can punish
him or leave him.

1540
01:45:49,643 --> 01:45:53,739
But please forgive us. We do not
want to fight this case anymore.

1541
01:45:53,847 --> 01:45:55,405
We do not want to fight
this case anymore.

1542
01:45:55,515 --> 01:45:57,540
Your honour, what is this going on?

1543
01:45:57,851 --> 01:46:00,342
Ultimately, what does my able
friend want to prove..

1544
01:46:00,454 --> 01:46:01,853
..by his big talks.

1545
01:46:01,955 --> 01:46:05,356
Mr. Vishnoi, please
keep your arguments..

1546
01:46:05,459 --> 01:46:06,687
..within the limits of the law.

1547
01:46:06,893 --> 01:46:09,020
And remember that a lady is
standing in front of you.

1548
01:46:09,162 --> 01:46:10,993
See that you do not hurt
her honor and respect.

1549
01:46:11,765 --> 01:46:15,462
And you too.. answer his
questions properly.

1550
01:46:15,569 --> 01:46:21,474
You're Honor, my client Sagar
Hussain is also accused that..

1551
01:46:21,575 --> 01:46:24,408
..because of his rape,
the girls not once..

1552
01:46:24,511 --> 01:46:26,411
..but remained pregnant
quite a few times.

1553
01:46:26,513 --> 01:46:28,003
And the abortion too was done.

1554
01:46:28,949 --> 01:46:32,407
These girls who used to sleep
with different men..

1555
01:46:32,519 --> 01:46:35,010
..remained pregnant only
because of Sagar Hussain.

1556
01:46:35,122 --> 01:46:36,817
How will the decision be taken?

1557
01:46:37,124 --> 01:46:40,821
l will put up a few important
points in front of the court.

1558
01:46:41,962 --> 01:46:44,430
The clothes that were found
at the spot of the incident..

1559
01:46:44,564 --> 01:46:46,498
..the laboratory tests of
those clothes was not done.

1560
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:51,997
Sagar Hussain's semen, OFL.
Report is not there.

1561
01:46:53,507 --> 01:46:55,737
The internal investigation
or the medical tests..

1562
01:46:55,842 --> 01:46:57,537
..of the girls was not done.

1563
01:46:57,778 --> 01:47:00,941
After the rape, the DNA test of the
girls was supposed to be done.

1564
01:47:01,047 --> 01:47:02,674
Was to be done under
any circumstances.

1565
01:47:02,783 --> 01:47:03,841
But that was not done.

1566
01:47:05,452 --> 01:47:08,683
When a culprit is charge sheeted..

1567
01:47:08,789 --> 01:47:11,417
..then the investigation report
is also submitted with it.

1568
01:47:11,792 --> 01:47:16,354
lt is obvious that.. my able
friend must be knowing that..

1569
01:47:16,496 --> 01:47:19,397
..in this case too the
medical test was done..

1570
01:47:19,499 --> 01:47:21,490
..and the blood report is
also attached with it.

1571
01:47:21,635 --> 01:47:24,570
Mr. Public prosecutor, what
is your blood group?

1572
01:47:25,839 --> 01:47:29,935
Mr. Vishnoi, you are again going
off track from the case.

1573
01:47:30,043 --> 01:47:32,011
Why are you getting nervous
with my simple question?

1574
01:47:32,112 --> 01:47:33,545
Tell me!

1575
01:47:34,047 --> 01:47:36,015
Well. lt is AB positive.

1576
01:47:36,116 --> 01:47:39,813
Your Honor, even Sagar Hussain
has the same blood group.

1577
01:47:41,955 --> 01:47:43,013
And many thousands and
lakhs of people..

1578
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:44,420
..must be having the
same blood group.

1579
01:47:46,793 --> 01:47:48,727
..this rape has been done
by Sagar Hussain?

1580
01:47:48,895 --> 01:47:52,353
So Mr. Verma; looking at this
report, we can charge..

1581
01:47:52,499 --> 01:47:55,662
..all the people who have
AB positive for rape.

1582
01:47:55,769 --> 01:48:01,002
lf we would have any male or
female's OFSL report here.

1583
01:48:01,508 --> 01:48:03,339
lf we would have a medical
report here.

1584
01:48:03,543 --> 01:48:05,010
lf we would have a DNA report here.

1585
01:48:05,111 --> 01:48:07,841
And if we would have the blood
report to support it.

1586
01:48:07,948 --> 01:48:09,347
Then the matter would
have been solved.

1587
01:48:09,449 --> 01:48:13,351
Only on the blood report, to
establish such a big charge..

1588
01:48:13,453 --> 01:48:15,353
..is absolutely impossible.

1589
01:48:15,455 --> 01:48:17,753
But in this case it is very simple!

1590
01:48:17,858 --> 01:48:21,350
To establish the charge sheet
the blood report is enough..

1591
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:23,895
..because the victims
are none other than..

1592
01:48:23,997 --> 01:48:26,431
..Sagar Hussain's own daughters.

1593
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:28,759
But where has this been written
in the book of law..

1594
01:48:28,902 --> 01:48:30,870
..that if they are your
own relatives..

1595
01:48:31,004 --> 01:48:32,995
..the medical tests
should not be done?

1596
01:48:33,106 --> 01:48:35,404
Besides this, the late
Bano had a habit..

1597
01:48:35,509 --> 01:48:37,534
..of writing the diary.

1598
01:48:37,644 --> 01:48:39,874
The diary itself is strong evidence.

1599
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:41,004
Her diary which she was writing
for the past eight years..

1600
01:48:41,114 --> 01:48:42,138
..is very well present here.

1601
01:48:42,449 --> 01:48:44,508
Do you have the OFSL
report of that diary?

1602
01:48:44,985 --> 01:48:47,886
The handwriting expert
has proved that..

1603
01:48:47,988 --> 01:48:51,424
..the writing in the diary
is that of late Bano.

1604
01:48:51,525 --> 01:48:54,688
But this does not prove that
the ink in the diary..

1605
01:48:54,828 --> 01:48:59,527
..was used in one night or
for the past eight years.

1606
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:01,929
Look here; l am repeating
once again that..

1607
01:49:02,035 --> 01:49:03,832
..if these two tests would
have been done..

1608
01:49:03,937 --> 01:49:05,996
..then the case of the prosecution
would have been strong.

1609
01:49:06,439 --> 01:49:09,340
But if you don't take it seriously
the points that l have..

1610
01:49:09,442 --> 01:49:11,342
..put forward and if you keep on
repeating only one thing that..

1611
01:49:11,444 --> 01:49:13,469
..his own daughters
have accused him.

1612
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:15,848
Then l will only have to
think that my client..

1613
01:49:15,949 --> 01:49:18,349
..will not getjustice
from this court.

1614
01:49:18,785 --> 01:49:23,347
No problem! But you be assured
that may be not here..

1615
01:49:23,456 --> 01:49:26,482
..but he will getjustice
in the high court.

1616
01:49:26,593 --> 01:49:29,824
Your Honor! My friend
is threatening me.

1617
01:49:29,963 --> 01:49:32,796
Mr. Vishnoi; behave yourself!

1618
01:49:32,966 --> 01:49:34,957
You are threatening the court.

1619
01:49:35,101 --> 01:49:36,466
l am sorry!

1620
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:40,904
Your Honor, l will again
repeat that my friend..

1621
01:49:41,007 --> 01:49:43,532
..is unnecessarily wasting
the time of the court.

1622
01:49:43,977 --> 01:49:46,343
The question in its
place is very big..

1623
01:49:46,446 --> 01:49:50,405
..and every court will have to
think about it very gravely.

1624
01:49:50,517 --> 01:49:53,418
ls this question not
important that..

1625
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:58,355
..why will his own daughters
accuse their father..

1626
01:49:58,458 --> 01:50:00,358
..of such a shameful deed?

1627
01:50:00,493 --> 01:50:02,757
Mr. Verma, l am coming
to that point itself.

1628
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:08,933
Okay! The court will listen to
your testimony very intently.

1629
01:50:09,035 --> 01:50:10,468
Thank you!

1630
01:50:10,971 --> 01:50:13,405
Two daughters out of the
three went wayward..

1631
01:50:13,506 --> 01:50:15,997
..as instructed by their mother.

1632
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:18,908
And the father came
to know about it.

1633
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:22,074
Now was the question of the
third daughter, Rubina.

1634
01:50:22,983 --> 01:50:26,749
Who had come of age, was
the father's pet..

1635
01:50:26,853 --> 01:50:28,753
..but she was a minor.

1636
01:50:29,055 --> 01:50:32,422
But the mother who was
greedy for wealth..

1637
01:50:32,525 --> 01:50:35,460
..and to accumulate as much
money as she could..

1638
01:50:35,562 --> 01:50:37,860
..she made a deal of the virginity
of her daughter..

1639
01:50:37,964 --> 01:50:39,898
..Rubina, with an out
station businessman.

1640
01:50:41,568 --> 01:50:43,798
Do you understand the meaning
of a deal of the virginity?

1641
01:50:43,970 --> 01:50:46,734
What? Why don't you tell?

1642
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:48,899
Those who do not know
will also come to know.

1643
01:50:51,044 --> 01:50:55,913
Hot flesh! That means when you
enter into the flesh trade.

1644
01:50:56,516 --> 01:51:02,421
The first person who bids; or the
one who is the highest bidder.

1645
01:51:02,722 --> 01:51:06,681
The girl has to sleep with
that man the first night.

1646
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:08,851
This is called as striking
the deal of virginity.

1647
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:14,396
But it was unfortunate
for them that..

1648
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:16,799
..Sagar Hussain came
to know of this.

1649
01:51:17,437 --> 01:51:21,396
He realized his responsibility
and duty of a father.

1650
01:51:21,508 --> 01:51:24,875
He tried to save his daughter
in all circumstances.

1651
01:51:25,045 --> 01:51:28,071
By all means he wanted to
save his youngest daughter.

1652
01:51:28,648 --> 01:51:31,811
That is why Sagar Hussain
had to take this step.

1653
01:51:34,654 --> 01:51:37,885
Father no! Father no!

1654
01:51:38,658 --> 01:51:45,689
lf you all do not listen to me,
then l will kill all four of you.

1655
01:51:48,034 --> 01:51:50,502
Tomorrow morning l want
to leave this city.

1656
01:51:51,705 --> 01:51:54,401
And all of you are going to
come with me to the village.

1657
01:51:54,507 --> 01:51:55,735
You understood, village!

1658
01:51:56,042 --> 01:51:59,808
Till l come back l don't want
to see anyone out of the house.

1659
01:52:02,382 --> 01:52:05,840
lf l find anyone out, then l will
cut that person into two.

1660
01:52:13,059 --> 01:52:16,358
lmdad, anyhow l want
to go to Lucknow..

1661
01:52:16,496 --> 01:52:18,691
..with my wife and my children
tomorrow morning.

1662
01:52:18,965 --> 01:52:21,399
You please get for me five
tickets of the Pushpak..

1663
01:52:21,501 --> 01:52:24,061
..or the Kushi Nagar express,
my brother.

1664
01:52:24,637 --> 01:52:27,731
lf you would have taken
this decision before..

1665
01:52:27,841 --> 01:52:29,809
..then today you would not
have to see this day.

1666
01:52:30,110 --> 01:52:33,409
Sagar, there is a saying that..
you may feed your child..

1667
01:52:33,513 --> 01:52:36,414
..with a golden spoon, but keep
an eye on them like an enemy.

1668
01:52:36,516 --> 01:52:39,542
Yes, my friend! l could
not be a father.

1669
01:52:39,786 --> 01:52:42,482
l am defeated by my
wife and my children.

1670
01:52:46,059 --> 01:52:48,687
You go and book the tickets.
Please for God's sake.

1671
01:52:49,562 --> 01:52:52,497
l will do something! l will make
the arrangements for the ticket.

1672
01:52:52,699 --> 01:52:53,893
Take care!
- Yes.

1673
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:16,416
This time only 1 1 items
in the personal party?

1674
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:19,415
Okay! Okay! l well send it.

1675
01:53:19,659 --> 01:53:21,354
Amre!
- What?

1676
01:53:21,494 --> 01:53:22,756
Tell me where are my
wife and my children?

1677
01:53:22,896 --> 01:53:25,023
Tell me; or else l will kill you.

1678
01:53:26,633 --> 01:53:28,533
What is the matter? You
seem to be very angry?

1679
01:53:32,105 --> 01:53:34,733
Oome; come, l will take you, come.

1680
01:53:42,715 --> 01:53:44,842
Hey Rifat! Why are
you getting scared?

1681
01:53:44,951 --> 01:53:47,613
Your father has come to meet you.

1682
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:48,846
Oome, Sagar.. come.

1683
01:53:49,055 --> 01:53:52,889
Sabina, see who has come?

1684
01:53:53,893 --> 01:53:58,023
Sagar, come.. come in!
Oome; come; see!

1685
01:54:22,922 --> 01:54:26,949
Strange! Will anyone talk
or ask something?

1686
01:54:27,393 --> 01:54:28,860
Go and get tea and snacks.

1687
01:54:28,995 --> 01:54:30,428
Oome Sagar, come and sit.

1688
01:54:31,931 --> 01:54:35,059
Hey come and sit! This
is your house too.

1689
01:54:36,035 --> 01:54:37,502
Don't you believe it?

1690
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:41,399
Ask Sabina! Sabina tell him,
whose house is this?

1691
01:54:42,709 --> 01:54:48,079
lt is our house! And if you wish,
then it can be yours too.

1692
01:54:50,783 --> 01:54:56,016
My daughters have earned this
with their hard earned money.

1693
01:54:56,122 --> 01:54:58,420
Yes father! As much
as this is mother's..

1694
01:54:58,524 --> 01:54:59,821
..it is equally yours too.

1695
01:54:59,926 --> 01:55:05,489
You only have made us so big,
and given us this youth.

1696
01:55:05,632 --> 01:55:08,795
That is why you too have an equal
right on our earned money.

1697
01:55:13,706 --> 01:55:17,608
ln your business, the rights are
only for the mediators and the pimps.

1698
01:55:17,777 --> 01:55:20,905
And l am not a pimp!
l am your father!

1699
01:55:22,649 --> 01:55:23,911
He will not listen!

1700
01:55:25,585 --> 01:55:28,884
Sagar Hussain, you can dream
with your eyes closed.

1701
01:55:29,122 --> 01:55:31,420
But when that dream
becomes a reality..

1702
01:55:31,524 --> 01:55:35,460
..then too you close your eyes
and think it to be a dream.

1703
01:55:36,095 --> 01:55:38,586
You have made them close their eyes.

1704
01:55:39,032 --> 01:55:41,500
Now also l tell you,
reform your ways.

1705
01:55:42,001 --> 01:55:44,902
Understand the reality! The Reality!

1706
01:55:45,038 --> 01:55:48,530
Father, in today's world,
money is only reality.

1707
01:55:48,641 --> 01:55:51,735
And to acquire that, if you
have to lay down yourself..

1708
01:55:51,844 --> 01:55:54,745
..for a few minutes, then
what is wrong in that?

1709
01:55:55,715 --> 01:55:56,807
And honor?

1710
01:55:56,916 --> 01:55:59,680
You think that the genital
part has any respect?

1711
01:56:01,554 --> 01:56:02,885
What you are thinking is wrong.

1712
01:56:02,989 --> 01:56:04,854
A luxurious flat in
a grand building..

1713
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:06,425
..is what we call respect.

1714
01:56:06,893 --> 01:56:09,862
The TV, fridge and AO in the flat,
is known as respect.

1715
01:56:10,496 --> 01:56:13,397
Oredit cards, mobiles,
designer shoes..

1716
01:56:13,499 --> 01:56:14,727
..and designerjewellery
is known as respect.

1717
01:56:14,834 --> 01:56:16,734
Which you will never
be able to give us.

1718
01:56:16,903 --> 01:56:21,897
To become rich overnight you have
left back your honor far away.

1719
01:56:23,943 --> 01:56:25,934
This is all because of you!

1720
01:56:27,113 --> 01:56:28,876
Throw him out of the house.

1721
01:56:28,982 --> 01:56:31,007
And by tomorrow morning see
that you leave this city.

1722
01:56:31,117 --> 01:56:34,917
Hey, you wicked woman,
what will you do?

1723
01:56:35,021 --> 01:56:36,818
Tell me; what will you do?

1724
01:56:36,923 --> 01:56:38,754
l will kill you! l will kill you!

1725
01:56:38,858 --> 01:56:42,555
l will kill you and throw
you to the dogs.

1726
01:56:44,831 --> 01:56:46,230
Hey, is Sagar Hussain your name?

1727
01:56:46,966 --> 01:56:48,433
You have raped your daughters?

1728
01:56:48,568 --> 01:56:51,799
Oome on; take him in!
- Oome on! Oome on!

1729
01:56:51,904 --> 01:56:53,997
Then that happened
what had to happen.

1730
01:56:54,107 --> 01:56:56,871
Not Sagar Hussain, but
a father became quiet.

1731
01:56:57,577 --> 01:57:00,068
He gave up himself in
the hands of destiny.

1732
01:57:00,713 --> 01:57:02,840
Because everyone in the society
was looking at him..

1733
01:57:02,949 --> 01:57:04,348
..with hatred in their eyes.

1734
01:57:04,584 --> 01:57:07,485
But the society had sympathy
for his daughters.

1735
01:57:07,587 --> 01:57:10,556
And he did not want them to be
degraded in front of the society.

1736
01:57:11,591 --> 01:57:14,685
But all of a sudden, something
unnatural happened!

1737
01:57:15,762 --> 01:57:17,491
Bano was dead!

1738
01:57:18,498 --> 01:57:20,728
A foresighted father
became restless.

1739
01:57:21,934 --> 01:57:24,869
He thought that even
now if l keep quiet..

1740
01:57:25,004 --> 01:57:27,734
..then the culprits will
become more strong.

1741
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:31,398
And God knows that my
other two daughters..

1742
01:57:31,511 --> 01:57:33,479
..would also face the
same consequences.

1743
01:57:33,613 --> 01:57:35,911
As regards to the death of Bano.

1744
01:57:36,716 --> 01:57:41,016
She was the main witness
to this case.

1745
01:57:41,954 --> 01:57:44,684
lt is a guess that she was
ashamed at the injustice..

1746
01:57:44,791 --> 01:57:46,486
..done to her father.

1747
01:57:46,926 --> 01:57:49,895
And gradually she was going
closer to her father.

1748
01:57:50,930 --> 01:57:54,366
May be at this stage she would
come and say something..

1749
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:56,900
..in this case, that is
why she was killed.

1750
01:57:59,705 --> 01:58:01,605
l can prove this!

1751
01:58:01,874 --> 01:58:05,002
But l want permission
to call the witness.

1752
01:58:05,778 --> 01:58:07,473
Yes Mr. P.P. Verma!

1753
01:58:08,448 --> 01:58:09,847
No objection, Your Honor!

1754
01:58:11,517 --> 01:58:12,745
Who is the witness?

1755
01:58:13,653 --> 01:58:14,847
lmdad Ali!

1756
01:58:16,055 --> 01:58:17,613
Permission granted!

1757
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:22,352
Bu before that l would like to
make a request to the court..

1758
01:58:22,495 --> 01:58:26,397
..that Mr. Amre, Sabina Begum
and her two daughters..

1759
01:58:26,499 --> 01:58:29,730
..should be kept in police
custody till hearing.

1760
01:58:29,836 --> 01:58:30,825
Why?

1761
01:58:30,970 --> 01:58:35,737
Because now l am going to prove
that it was not suicide..

1762
01:58:35,842 --> 01:58:37,605
..but it was a murder.

1763
01:58:38,444 --> 01:58:39,741
lt was a planned murder!

1764
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:48,853
And l don't wish that anyone of
them should suffer like Bano.

1765
01:58:51,991 --> 01:58:55,358
The court orders the
prosecution that..

1766
01:58:55,495 --> 01:58:58,396
..Mr. Amre, Sabina Begum
and her two daughters..

1767
01:58:58,498 --> 01:58:59,897
..should be kept under
police custody.

1768
01:59:01,067 --> 01:59:04,969
lmdad Ali sir, what
is your full name?

1769
01:59:05,872 --> 01:59:09,330
lmdad Ali, son of Ghulam Ali!
- Okay!

1770
01:59:09,775 --> 01:59:12,938
Since when do you
know Sagar Hussain?

1771
01:59:13,045 --> 01:59:16,481
From Lucknow! He is
my childhood friend.

1772
01:59:16,983 --> 01:59:20,544
Sagar Hussain and l have
grown up together.

1773
01:59:20,653 --> 01:59:25,022
First l came to Mumbai then
he contacted me for a job.

1774
01:59:25,124 --> 01:59:27,354
Then without hesitation,
l called him here.

1775
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:28,620
Okay!

1776
01:59:28,828 --> 01:59:31,729
That means you and Sagar Hussain
have come a long way.

1777
01:59:32,031 --> 01:59:35,398
How did you find Sagar
Hussain as regards..

1778
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:38,800
..talking, behavior and dealings?

1779
01:59:39,172 --> 01:59:41,936
Lawyer sir, as a decent
person should be.

1780
01:59:42,041 --> 01:59:47,343
But Sagar Hussain is accused of
raping his own three daughters.

1781
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:50,346
According to you, do you think
that he can do such..

1782
01:59:50,449 --> 01:59:51,746
..a shameful deed?

1783
01:59:51,851 --> 01:59:54,342
Lawyer sir, even if someone
goes through a fire test..

1784
01:59:54,453 --> 01:59:57,854
..and tells me, even then
l will not believe it.

1785
01:59:59,392 --> 02:00:02,361
Okay, Sagar Hussain's
elder daughter, Bano.

1786
02:00:02,495 --> 02:00:05,896
Were you the last person
to meet her? - Yes.

1787
02:00:05,998 --> 02:00:07,966
The court would like
to know as to why..

1788
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:09,795
..had you gone to meet her?

1789
02:00:10,937 --> 02:00:12,905
Lawyer sir, just because
we did not have money..

1790
02:00:13,005 --> 02:00:14,802
..you were reluctant
to handle this case.

1791
02:00:15,975 --> 02:00:18,535
My friend, Sagar Hussain
was worried.

1792
02:00:18,945 --> 02:00:21,413
One day he called me
over and told me..

1793
02:00:21,514 --> 02:00:24,415
..that the deposit money of his
room is with the landlord.

1794
02:00:24,617 --> 02:00:26,744
Now no one stays in that room.

1795
02:00:28,454 --> 02:00:31,423
So you go to the landlord
and get the money..

1796
02:00:31,524 --> 02:00:33,014
..and give it to the lawyer.

1797
02:00:33,125 --> 02:00:35,423
So that he would be ready
to handle my case.

1798
02:00:35,995 --> 02:00:39,431
l went to the landlord, and
asked for the deposit money.

1799
02:00:39,565 --> 02:00:41,795
But he flatly refused.

1800
02:00:42,101 --> 02:00:44,467
He said that Sabina
Begum had told him..

1801
02:00:49,976 --> 02:00:53,412
That day, Sabina Begum and
Amre had stayed back..

1802
02:00:53,512 --> 02:00:55,480
..in the court for some work.

1803
02:00:55,715 --> 02:01:00,345
When l came out.. there
Bano was standing.

1804
02:01:04,890 --> 02:01:08,348
Bano, tell me how far is it
proper to trouble someone..

1805
02:01:08,494 --> 02:01:10,689
..for your own happiness? Tell me!

1806
02:01:10,963 --> 02:01:13,488
Uncle, but what can l do?

1807
02:01:13,766 --> 02:01:16,394
Look here dear, l had gone
to the landlord at Mumbra.

1808
02:01:16,502 --> 02:01:18,970
To get the deposit money,
as the room is vacant.

1809
02:01:19,105 --> 02:01:20,800
You all have gone to
stay in the big flat.

1810
02:01:20,906 --> 02:01:23,670
lf l get the deposit money, then
l can pay the lawyer his fees.

1811
02:01:23,776 --> 02:01:24,868
Then go and take it!

1812
02:01:25,111 --> 02:01:27,409
He will not give. He says that
till you or your mother..

1813
02:01:27,513 --> 02:01:29,879
..does not tell him, he
will not give the money.

1814
02:01:33,052 --> 02:01:36,419
Okay uncle, you come tomorrow,
l will give you.

1815
02:01:39,992 --> 02:01:42,085
Uncle you! Greetings! Oome in!

1816
02:01:42,228 --> 02:01:43,490
Greeting to you too.

1817
02:01:43,629 --> 02:01:47,690
Oome in; sit down. Sit down!

1818
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:52,662
One minute! l will just finish this.

1819
02:01:54,573 --> 02:01:55,870
Yes, this is the latest mobile.

1820
02:01:55,975 --> 02:01:57,408
Here are many functions in this.

1821
02:01:57,510 --> 02:01:59,535
You know there is a
camera too in this.

1822
02:01:59,645 --> 02:02:02,739
Shall l click your photo?
One minute! Look here!

1823
02:02:04,383 --> 02:02:06,681
See! l clicked it! Looks good.

1824
02:02:06,786 --> 02:02:07,844
One more with you and me.

1825
02:02:07,987 --> 02:02:10,478
One minute, l will keep this here.

1826
02:02:12,725 --> 02:02:15,353
Now a movie will be made with us.

1827
02:02:17,096 --> 02:02:18,358
Just see this! l forgot
to give you water..

1828
02:02:18,497 --> 02:02:19,862
..as l was engrossed in the mobile.

1829
02:02:20,499 --> 02:02:24,526
Here take this! Drink water. Take.

1830
02:02:28,507 --> 02:02:31,533
Bano, what happened
to the deposit money?

1831
02:02:31,644 --> 02:02:33,737
Uncle, as soon as l came here
l called the landlord.

1832
02:02:33,846 --> 02:02:36,076
He must be on his
way with the money.

1833
02:02:37,049 --> 02:02:40,075
Hey you scoundrel! Why
have you come here?

1834
02:02:40,186 --> 02:02:42,882
Mother.. - Had you come here to
spy on this shameless woman?

1835
02:02:43,856 --> 02:02:48,691
What? Were you trying to trap
my daughter in your sweet talk?

1836
02:02:48,828 --> 02:02:49,817
Sabina l..

1837
02:02:49,962 --> 02:02:52,396
Keep quiet! Have you still
not come to your senses..

1838
02:02:52,498 --> 02:02:54,523
..after seeing the state of
your friend, Sagar Hussain?

1839
02:02:54,834 --> 02:02:58,531
You.. now you are on my hit list!

1840
02:02:58,771 --> 02:03:01,865
l will kill you in such a place,
where you will not even get water.

1841
02:03:01,974 --> 02:03:03,407
Mother, will you please
listen to me?

1842
02:03:03,509 --> 02:03:04,601
Uncle did not come here by himself.

1843
02:03:04,710 --> 02:03:05,734
l called him here!

1844
02:03:05,845 --> 02:03:06,937
The landlord must be on his way.

1845
02:03:07,046 --> 02:03:08,343
l have asked him to get
the deposit money.

1846
02:03:08,447 --> 02:03:09,436
Okay? Oome on with me!

1847
02:03:09,548 --> 02:03:11,413
What were you doing alone
with the child in the room?

1848
02:03:11,584 --> 02:03:12,949
First the father was behind them.

1849
02:03:13,052 --> 02:03:16,544
Now the uncle is also trying
to take advantage.

1850
02:03:16,655 --> 02:03:19,351
Henceforth if l see you here,
then you will not be able..

1851
02:03:19,458 --> 02:03:21,426
..to walk on your feet.

1852
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:23,357
You had come here to emotionally
blackmail..

1853
02:03:23,496 --> 02:03:24,929
..my innocent daughter and
to extract money from her?

1854
02:03:25,030 --> 02:03:26,019
Do you think that it is
your father's property?

1855
02:03:26,165 --> 02:03:27,598
Go away from here! Go!

1856
02:03:30,703 --> 02:03:31,795
Then what happened?

1857
02:03:31,904 --> 02:03:33,531
Then l came away from there.

1858
02:03:34,039 --> 02:03:35,734
But in the evening l
came to know that..

1859
02:03:35,841 --> 02:03:37,672
..Bano committed suicide.

1860
02:03:38,511 --> 02:03:41,912
But lawyer sir, l don't think that
Bano had committed suicide.

1861
02:03:42,515 --> 02:03:45,678
l had seen her feelings for
her father within her.

1862
02:03:46,652 --> 02:03:48,847
She had sympathy for her father.

1863
02:03:49,455 --> 02:03:52,754
May be Amre and Sabina must have
felt the feelings in Bano..

1864
02:03:52,858 --> 02:03:56,021
..that is why they must
have killed her.

1865
02:04:02,768 --> 02:04:04,326
Your witness!

1866
02:04:08,107 --> 02:04:13,943
So according to you, this was
not a suicide but a murder.

1867
02:04:15,114 --> 02:04:18,413
Why do you feel like that?

1868
02:04:18,651 --> 02:04:20,846
You must have some reason
for this thought?

1869
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:24,348
Lawyer sir, l know these
people not today..

1870
02:04:24,457 --> 02:04:26,482
..but from many years.

1871
02:04:26,725 --> 02:04:29,956
l also know what happened
and why it happened?

1872
02:04:30,095 --> 02:04:31,528
Why did it happen?

1873
02:04:32,031 --> 02:04:34,932
These people are so shameful
and down trodden that..

1874
02:04:35,034 --> 02:04:38,401
..the way they trapped my
friend Sagar Hussain..

1875
02:04:38,504 --> 02:04:40,938
..the same way they
have killed Bano.

1876
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:44,874
Mr. lmdad Ali, you have
not answered my question.

1877
02:04:44,977 --> 02:04:47,741
Why is this murder and not suicide?

1878
02:04:49,114 --> 02:04:52,413
When l met Bano, she looked
very happy to me.

1879
02:04:52,518 --> 02:04:53,746
She was chatting with me.

1880
02:04:53,853 --> 02:04:57,016
Lawyer sir, those who are happy,
they never commit suicide.

1881
02:04:57,456 --> 02:05:00,823
Okay, we agree that people who
are happy never commit suicide.

1882
02:05:02,628 --> 02:05:04,858
On which date did you meet Bano?

1883
02:05:04,997 --> 02:05:06,624
Somewhere around, 1 7 or 18..

1884
02:05:06,765 --> 02:05:08,062
Give me the fixed date!
1 7th or 18th?

1885
02:05:08,167 --> 02:05:09,998
Just one date l want to know.

1886
02:05:10,102 --> 02:05:11,535
Objection, Your Honor!

1887
02:05:11,670 --> 02:05:13,001
What is the question of the date?

1888
02:05:13,439 --> 02:05:14,736
Oarry on, Mr. Verma!

1889
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:15,898
Thank you, Your Honor!

1890
02:05:16,008 --> 02:05:17,532
On the 18th!

1891
02:05:18,911 --> 02:05:23,814
Your Honor, this person is lying!

1892
02:05:24,783 --> 02:05:28,412
Because Sagar Hussain's
case was in the 1 7th..

1893
02:05:28,521 --> 02:05:32,082
..and Bano committed
suicide on the 18th.

1894
02:05:33,792 --> 02:05:35,760
Okay, when you went
to Bano's house..

1895
02:05:35,895 --> 02:05:37,419
..then first of all what happened?

1896
02:05:37,563 --> 02:05:39,758
First she made me sit down,
then she gave me..

1897
02:05:39,899 --> 02:05:41,491
..a glass of water to drink.

1898
02:05:42,501 --> 02:05:46,665
Your Honor; even here
this person is lying.

1899
02:05:47,706 --> 02:05:51,403
That glass is present in
the court as evidence.

1900
02:05:51,510 --> 02:05:53,000
And there are no finger
prints on them.

1901
02:05:54,446 --> 02:05:57,745
l think that the public prosecutor
has a strong point..

1902
02:05:57,850 --> 02:06:00,751
..that is why the defence
has not said anything.

1903
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:05,349
Whenever a suicide is brought
to the notice of the police.

1904
02:06:05,457 --> 02:06:09,484
Then all the things are
taken into consideration.

1905
02:06:09,762 --> 02:06:13,858
lt is obvious that even in murder,
they have to think.

1906
02:06:14,033 --> 02:06:17,400
ln spite of this if the
court wants to verify..

1907
02:06:17,503 --> 02:06:20,404
..then all the evidences
are present in the court.

1908
02:06:20,506 --> 02:06:23,407
Your Honor! All the material that
is present in the court..

1909
02:06:23,509 --> 02:06:25,909
..regarding Banos suicide.

1910
02:06:26,011 --> 02:06:28,002
l would like to check those items.

1911
02:06:28,981 --> 02:06:31,745
All the items to be produced
in the court!

1912
02:06:39,992 --> 02:06:41,425
Open it!

1913
02:06:55,641 --> 02:06:59,008
Your Honor, these items
that are opened just now.

1914
02:06:59,178 --> 02:07:01,738
These are not seen
by me or lmdad Ali.

1915
02:07:02,448 --> 02:07:07,511
The water bottle and the glass
prove that my witness is not lying.

1916
02:07:08,053 --> 02:07:10,351
But now the question arises
that why are there..

1917
02:07:10,456 --> 02:07:11,946
..no finger prints on this?

1918
02:07:15,427 --> 02:07:18,419
Just give this mobile
to Madam Judge.

1919
02:07:23,702 --> 02:07:27,536
You're Honor; just try
and operate the mobile?

1920
02:07:30,609 --> 02:07:34,067
Mr. Vishnoi, looks like
the battery is over.

1921
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:35,808
The phone is not working.

1922
02:07:35,948 --> 02:07:37,472
One moment, Your Honor!

1923
02:07:37,583 --> 02:07:40,484
Mr. Verma, please give
me your mobile?

1924
02:07:40,786 --> 02:07:43,414
Why?
- You don't even stop questioning..

1925
02:07:43,522 --> 02:07:45,490
..at the crucial moment? Give!

1926
02:07:50,429 --> 02:07:51,691
Thank you!

1927
02:07:52,031 --> 02:07:54,795
Remove the battery from this
and put it in that mobile.

1928
02:08:12,584 --> 02:08:13,881
Now go into the video.

1929
02:08:19,992 --> 02:08:21,482
'Shameless girl, come here!

1930
02:08:21,593 --> 02:08:23,527
What were you doing with
that innocent girl?

1931
02:08:23,929 --> 02:08:25,487
First the father was behind them.

1932
02:08:25,631 --> 02:08:28,532
Now the uncle too? You were trying
to take advantage of the situation?

1933
02:08:28,701 --> 02:08:34,401
Henceforth if l see you here again,
then l will break your legs.

1934
02:08:34,506 --> 02:08:36,406
You were emotionally blackmailing
my innocent daughter..

1935
02:08:36,508 --> 02:08:37,736
..and trying to extract
money from her?

1936
02:08:37,843 --> 02:08:38,901
Do you think that this
is your father's money?

1937
02:08:39,011 --> 02:08:40,535
Just go away form here! Go away!

1938
02:08:41,647 --> 02:08:44,548
Just thank the landlord
that he called us up.

1939
02:08:44,650 --> 02:08:46,675
And we came here at the right time.

1940
02:08:46,785 --> 02:08:48,343
Otherwise this shameless girl
had made all the plans..

1941
02:08:48,454 --> 02:08:49,478
..of giving money to lmdad.

1942
02:08:49,588 --> 02:08:50,850
So that Sagar would be released..

1943
02:08:50,956 --> 02:08:52,480
..and we would land up behind bars.

1944
02:08:52,591 --> 02:08:56,357
Okay! You wretched girl! Now
you have become so big..

1945
02:08:56,495 --> 02:08:58,895
..that you take your own decisions?

1946
02:08:58,997 --> 02:09:02,330
You forgot those days when you
had to sleep with those..

1947
02:09:02,434 --> 02:09:04,425
..boys for 50 rupees?

1948
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:07,334
At least thank Amre, that he
gave you a job in the bar..

1949
02:09:07,439 --> 02:09:09,407
..and we could see good days.

1950
02:09:09,508 --> 02:09:10,805
Have you forgotten those days?

1951
02:09:10,909 --> 02:09:13,673
But mother, what crime
have l committed?

1952
02:09:13,779 --> 02:09:15,610
That you are losing your control?

1953
02:09:15,914 --> 02:09:17,939
After all he is my father!

1954
02:09:18,917 --> 02:09:21,351
l just thought of helping
him a little..

1955
02:09:21,453 --> 02:09:23,751
..but you made a big noise about it.

1956
02:09:24,723 --> 02:09:28,352
What was his mistake? Only this,
that he wanted us..

1957
02:09:28,460 --> 02:09:30,826
..to change our ways and reform.

1958
02:09:30,963 --> 02:09:33,727
That is the duty of any
respectable father.

1959
02:09:33,899 --> 02:09:37,926
lt was your duty too, but you were
busy in enjoying your life.

1960
02:09:38,036 --> 02:09:39,401
You were busy in accumulating
wealth.

1961
02:09:39,505 --> 02:09:40,597
You were interested only
in selling our flesh.

1962
02:09:40,706 --> 02:09:42,731
You are a wretched woman,
a filthy woman.

1963
02:09:42,841 --> 02:09:47,335
You are going out of hand! You
have started talking too much.

1964
02:09:47,913 --> 02:09:49,608
You scoundrel, you do
not talk in the middle.

1965
02:09:49,715 --> 02:09:50,875
This is our family matter!

1966
02:09:50,983 --> 02:09:54,885
You have decided to make my father
rot in jail all his life?

1967
02:09:55,788 --> 02:09:59,815
You witch! Today this has
become your family matter?

1968
02:09:59,925 --> 02:10:01,358
And l a pimp?

1969
02:10:03,562 --> 02:10:05,496
You have destroyed the lives
of all three of us.

1970
02:10:05,631 --> 02:10:07,997
God knows how many more
girls you have ruined?

1971
02:10:10,169 --> 02:10:12,399
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

1972
02:10:12,504 --> 02:10:13,596
Yes, l have gone mad!

1973
02:10:13,705 --> 02:10:15,002
Mother, leave me!

1974
02:10:15,174 --> 02:10:18,007
You scoundrel! You survive
on our earnings!

1975
02:10:18,110 --> 02:10:19,407
And you raise your hand on me?

1976
02:10:19,511 --> 02:10:20,535
Just keep quiet!

1977
02:10:20,646 --> 02:10:22,739
You do not know how to
respect the elders?

1978
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:24,543
You are saying anything
that comes to your mouth.

1979
02:10:24,650 --> 02:10:26,880
You have become very rude.

1980
02:10:27,052 --> 02:10:28,747
You cannot bear happiness?

1981
02:10:28,954 --> 02:10:31,479
You have become very arrogant!

1982
02:10:32,524 --> 02:10:34,685
Oome on; say sorry to Amre!

1983
02:10:35,494 --> 02:10:37,758
Mother, you have become arrogant.

1984
02:10:37,963 --> 02:10:40,557
That you cannot see anything
beyond this man.

1985
02:10:41,033 --> 02:10:46,528
l should say sorry and that too
to this scoundrel? Never! Never!

1986
02:10:47,105 --> 02:10:49,539
Today l will definitely
decide something.

1987
02:10:49,775 --> 02:10:51,538
What decision are you going to make?

1988
02:10:51,643 --> 02:10:53,406
What is there in your hands?

1989
02:10:53,779 --> 02:10:56,077
You just watch what is in my hands?

1990
02:10:56,648 --> 02:11:00,482
Till today you thought that you
had played your cards right?

1991
02:11:00,919 --> 02:11:02,819
Then we are responsible for that.

1992
02:11:02,988 --> 02:11:06,856
You think that you are very clever,
you are very cunning.

1993
02:11:06,959 --> 02:11:09,427
And you are very proud that
you are very smart.

1994
02:11:09,828 --> 02:11:13,355
l will change my name from
Bano Sagar Hussain..

1995
02:11:13,498 --> 02:11:17,059
..if l do not degrade you and
him in front of everybody.

1996
02:11:17,769 --> 02:11:19,896
l will tell everything in the court.

1997
02:11:20,005 --> 02:11:22,599
l will open all your cards
there in the court.

1998
02:11:22,908 --> 02:11:25,900
l will tell them that my
father had not raped us..

1999
02:11:26,011 --> 02:11:27,672
..but he has.

2000
02:11:27,846 --> 02:11:30,076
And you are equally responsible
for this crime.

2001
02:11:30,449 --> 02:11:32,417
l will tell them each
and everything.

2002
02:11:32,517 --> 02:11:35,953
l detest you and this place.

2003
02:11:36,054 --> 02:11:37,544
l am going!

2004
02:11:46,832 --> 02:11:49,733
She has said enough!

2005
02:11:49,902 --> 02:11:52,803
Her life is death for us!

2006
02:12:54,599 --> 02:12:58,399
Your Honor, till today the
rape case was going on..

2007
02:12:58,503 --> 02:13:01,336
..against Sagar Hussain.

2008
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:06,340
But the reality is.. that we
and the complete society..

2009
02:13:06,445 --> 02:13:08,675
..has raped Sagar Hussain.

2010
02:13:08,981 --> 02:13:11,472
Every minute we were raping him.

2011
02:13:11,783 --> 02:13:16,413
No one's bothered about what
humiliation he has gone through?

2012
02:13:16,521 --> 02:13:19,422
Have we ever thought that where
is the society leading to?

2013
02:13:20,659 --> 02:13:23,423
lt is going in the valley
of filth and darkness.

2014
02:13:23,962 --> 02:13:26,522
Everywhere people are
running after money.

2015
02:13:26,832 --> 02:13:29,528
There is no difference between
legal and illegal.

2016
02:13:29,634 --> 02:13:31,864
The only thing is that
money should come.

2017
02:13:31,970 --> 02:13:33,995
lt should come in any
form or from anywhere.

2018
02:13:34,106 --> 02:13:35,733
But it should come.

2019
02:13:36,575 --> 02:13:40,875
We have forgotten the morals
and values of our life.

2020
02:13:41,780 --> 02:13:43,008
That's all, your Honour.

2021
02:13:47,786 --> 02:13:49,617
Judgement on the 1 7th.

2022
02:13:53,658 --> 02:13:57,355
This video clipping has
uncovered the mask..

2023
02:13:57,496 --> 02:14:01,330
..of relationships from
the face of humans..

2024
02:14:01,433 --> 02:14:05,335
..and has shown the real and nasty
face of these cruel people..

2025
02:14:05,437 --> 02:14:08,406
..the court is astonished
to see that.

2026
02:14:08,974 --> 02:14:12,341
A lady judge was appointed
for this case..

2027
02:14:12,444 --> 02:14:14,844
..so that no injustice
is done to women.

2028
02:14:15,714 --> 02:14:18,945
So that every detail should
be heard carefully.

2029
02:14:19,918 --> 02:14:24,855
But it has been proven that,
a woman is an enemy of woman.

2030
02:14:27,526 --> 02:14:31,360
A woman has put a stigma
on humanity..

2031
02:14:31,496 --> 02:14:33,430
..by abandoning her principles.

2032
02:14:33,899 --> 02:14:37,733
She accused her husband of being
ruthless disgraceful..

2033
02:14:37,836 --> 02:14:42,000
..and that too for her
money and luxury.

2034
02:14:43,108 --> 02:14:45,406
And when the daughter's
conscience awakened..

2035
02:14:45,510 --> 02:14:47,808
..they killed her too.

2036
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:52,739
Such a woman is not a mother,
she is a witch.

2037
02:14:52,918 --> 02:14:54,818
She is a stigma to motherhood!

2038
02:14:57,989 --> 02:15:01,356
The court is in favour with the
question raised by the defence.

2039
02:15:01,960 --> 02:15:04,895
And appeals to the government..

2040
02:15:04,996 --> 02:15:08,397
..to find out the reason for
such social degradation..

2041
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:10,900
..and find a solution to stop it.

2042
02:15:11,436 --> 02:15:15,736
The court orders to arrest
Sabina madam and Amre..

2043
02:15:15,841 --> 02:15:21,404
..and prosecuted for falsely
accusing Sagar Hussain..

2044
02:15:21,513 --> 02:15:27,679
..and for misleading and killing
Bano Sagar Hussain.

2045
02:15:28,587 --> 02:15:32,421
And both her daughters should
be sent to Asha Sadan.

2046
02:15:32,858 --> 02:15:36,419
And the court also gives orders..

2047
02:15:36,561 --> 02:15:40,463
..to investigate the role
of the lO in this case.

2048
02:15:40,832 --> 02:15:44,529
And the court should be informed
about the investigation.

2049
02:15:45,504 --> 02:15:49,406
Because, without the
help of the police..

2050
02:15:49,508 --> 02:15:51,533
..such an incident cannot happen.

2051
02:15:53,645 --> 02:15:56,409
And for Mr. Sagar Hussain..

2052
02:15:56,515 --> 02:16:01,748
..the court considers Mr.
Sagar Hussain innocent

2053
02:16:02,787 --> 02:16:04,550
And acquits him.

2054
02:16:20,038 --> 02:16:22,905
Be careful, go.

2055
02:16:25,911 --> 02:16:28,539
Take care of yourself.

2056
02:16:30,515 --> 02:16:31,812
He is going.

2057
02:16:39,191 --> 02:16:43,685
You are spread like a virus..
now l won't say it.

2058
02:16:43,828 --> 02:16:46,422
All the best, all the best.

2059
02:16:49,701 --> 02:16:54,570
l had told you, entrust
yourself to Lord.

2060
02:16:58,910 --> 02:17:02,846
He always saves his devotees
from the stigma.

2061
02:17:03,715 --> 02:17:07,674
You did not come here because
you committed any crime.

2062
02:17:07,886 --> 02:17:13,415
Allah sent you here so
that you can acquit me.

2063
02:17:13,725 --> 02:17:19,527
Sagar, l committed 7 murders
but l have no regrets.

2064
02:17:20,498 --> 02:17:25,595
But l thought about murdering you,
l will regret it all my life.

2065
02:17:26,771 --> 02:17:29,899
What can l do, l am a criminal
l think like a criminal..

2066
02:17:30,008 --> 02:17:32,067
..l think that every other
person is a criminal.

2067
02:17:32,711 --> 02:17:36,408
Only Nadir sir is true,
he recognised you.

2068
02:17:36,514 --> 02:17:38,482
Oome atleast embrace me.

2069
02:17:45,890 --> 02:17:49,348
Brother, today on the occasion of
Sagar Hussain being released..

2070
02:17:49,494 --> 02:17:52,429
..there will be celebrations
in the jail!

2071
02:18:11,916 --> 02:18:14,407
Keep this, they will be helpful.

2072
02:18:14,986 --> 02:18:18,683
Sagar, the years that
you spent in jail..

2073
02:18:18,790 --> 02:18:21,418
..the law cannot give
it back to you.

2074
02:18:21,526 --> 02:18:25,895
But l will pray that you don't face
anymore troubles in future.

2075
02:18:27,565 --> 02:18:29,897
Sir, l have a request.

2076
02:18:31,836 --> 02:18:34,737
Let me go out from the back door.

2077
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:39,401
The TV and media people must
be standing outside..

2078
02:18:39,511 --> 02:18:43,538
..l don't have the strength
to answer their questions.

2079
02:18:45,784 --> 02:18:46,944
Oome with me.

2080
02:19:02,901 --> 02:19:05,665
Did you see Sagar Hussain,
there is no one here.

2081
02:19:05,970 --> 02:19:09,406
People always look out
for their benefit.

2082
02:19:09,874 --> 02:19:12,468
Media people always run behind them.

2083
02:19:12,844 --> 02:19:15,335
You have been proven innocent..

2084
02:19:15,447 --> 02:19:18,007
..they don't have anything to
benefit from your innocence.

2085
02:19:18,116 --> 02:19:20,346
People gather to defame you..

2086
02:19:20,452 --> 02:19:23,751
..once you are proven innocent
no one is interested.

2087
02:19:23,855 --> 02:19:25,755
Neither the people, nor the media.

2088
02:19:27,058 --> 02:19:28,616
Now tell me, where you will go.

2089
02:19:30,495 --> 02:19:35,432
l don't know sir, wherever
the roads take me.

2090
02:19:37,635 --> 02:19:38,795
Bye.

2091
02:20:05,930 --> 02:20:09,422
'Sagar Hussain must be present
somewhere amongst you.'

2092
02:20:09,567 --> 02:20:12,468
'lf you spot him somewhere, don't
look at him with hatred.'
