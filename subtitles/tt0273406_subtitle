00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:18,640
Catch her! Don't let her escape!

3
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:22,156
Is somebody there! Help me!

4
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:23,377
Catch her!

5
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:32,505
Help!

6
00:03:33,852 --> 00:03:34,916
Catch her!

7
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:53,707
Come. Come.
We rule this place. Come.

8
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:57,537
I don't know, sir. I don't know
where that girl ran away.

9
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,572
I don't know, sir.

10
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:09,583
Look Shano, don't do this drama.

11
00:04:10,435 --> 00:04:13,984
Speak up. Where is the girl?

12
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:20,661
Don't be afraid.
Did you have something to eat? Now, say.

13
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:25,511
I don't know, sir.
- If you speak up, then you'll survive.

14
00:04:25,591 --> 00:04:26,899
I'm telling the truth, sir.

15
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:29,494
I didn't help her in escaping.
God promise.

16
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:32,744
So you won't say! You won't say!

17
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:34,078
Greetings, Baburao-ji.

18
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:37,536
How are you?
- Fine.

19
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,211
I'd told you about them
in the morning.

20
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,433
They live in Mumbai.
- Greetings.

21
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,953
They're very rich.
They've come to buy a girl.

22
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:45,677
Hey, give him his money.
And a bit to me too.

23
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:48,286
Hey, Kancha.

24
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:53,017
Come here. There. Stand properly.

25
00:04:53,097 --> 00:04:54,286
Come and have a look.

26
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:55,666
We don't charge for
just seeing them.

27
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:02,525
Leave me! Leave me! Leave me!

28
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:06,994
Leave me! Leave me! Leave me!
- Come here!

29
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:11,286
Go there!

30
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,619
Baburao-bhai, here is your money.
Let's go.

31
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:26,036
Rudra.
- Yes.

32
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:28,265
Go and lock her up.
- No!

33
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:29,068
Come..
- No!

34
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:30,079
Come..
- No!

35
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:33,131
Come! Come!
- Leave me!

36
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:38,121
Hey, Kancha.
Deposit the money in the bank. - Fine.

37
00:05:47,844 --> 00:05:49,411
No, sir. No, sir.

38
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:55,455
Forgive me! Forgive me!

39
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:46,161
6 o'clock a.m. 6 o'clock a.m.
6 o'clock a.m.

40
00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:46,411
What is this, granny? You scared me.

41
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:48,953
I didn't scare you. I woke you up.

42
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:52,494
I have to play new tricks
to wake you up everyday.

43
00:07:52,744 --> 00:07:55,578
Come on, get ready quickly.
You have to go for a jog.

44
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:58,495
Sapna has already called 4 times.
She's waiting for you.

45
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:00,294
Oh, granny. You're so sweet!

46
00:08:00,374 --> 00:08:03,328
Enough of flattering.
Now hurry up. Come on.

47
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:05,286
Okay.
- Good girl.

48
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:10,411
Listen I've told you so many
times not to give a penny..

49
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:12,661
..to Pooja's father from
the office money.

50
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,244
He splurges the money in
gambling and drinking.

51
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:16,744
Where is he right now?

52
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,515
Why did you take such a long
time in opening the door?

53
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:28,204
Is every person sleeping here?

54
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:29,994
No one is in their senses.

55
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:33,073
Where have you splurged the money
that you took from the office?

56
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:38,940
Even you splurge so much.
Beauty parlour.. kitty party.

57
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:40,727
Have I asked you to give
account for that?

58
00:08:41,185 --> 00:08:43,190
Who are you to ask for the accounts?

59
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:45,102
It's all my father's money.

60
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:50,372
I'm not your father's servant.
I'm your husband.

61
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:54,187
If henceforth you ever dare
to talk to me like this..

62
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,841
..then I'll not spare you.
Understood!

63
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,020
What's the matter, Sapna?

64
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:08,664
Hi, Sapna. Hi, Pooja.
- Hi, Kailash.

65
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:10,197
God knows what has happened to her.

66
00:09:10,277 --> 00:09:11,860
Since morning she is so dejected.

67
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:13,402
I can't understand anything.

68
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:17,527
What's the matter, Sapna?
- Brother knows about our love.

69
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:20,011
And he wants to get me married
to someone else.

70
00:09:20,277 --> 00:09:23,111
Oh my God!
But how can we solve this problem?

71
00:09:23,457 --> 00:09:26,148
My friend can help us
solve this problem.

72
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,548
But who is this person?
- Chandar.

73
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:41,360
Shut up!

74
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,547
"There is talk.."

75
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:39,584
Thank you, child!

76
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:40,968
"There is talk.."

77
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:43,919
"There are talks about us.."

78
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:45,571
"On the streets, beloved.."

79
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:49,957
"There are talks about us
on the streets, beloved.."

80
00:10:50,536 --> 00:10:54,791
"We are faltering, crazy people,
our steps are faltering.."

81
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:59,384
"We don't care about anything,
we are carefree.."

82
00:10:59,464 --> 00:11:03,327
"There are talks about us
on the streets, beloved.."

83
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:07,591
"There are talks about us
on the streets, beloved.."

84
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,819
Stop it!

85
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:40,610
What do you guys think
of yourselves!

86
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:42,444
What do you know about music!

87
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:44,572
You don't know anything
about tunes and rhythm!

88
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:46,572
You don't know about
heart and heartbeats!

89
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:50,533
You just shake your
bodies like a madman!

90
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:51,985
You don't have any strength
in your hands and legs!

91
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:53,152
We're no less than anybody!

92
00:11:55,385 --> 00:12:00,203
Hey, boss..
this fellow just insulted us.

93
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:04,614
Hey, what are you
droning about boss!

94
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:08,592
Tell your boss, if he is a true man..
then play this thing.

95
00:12:09,402 --> 00:12:12,829
Boss, our reputation is at stake.
Play this thing.

96
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:21,277
Look at him.

97
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:25,845
He's holding the instrument
as if it is some dead snake.

98
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:46,658
"You start it.."

99
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:51,957
"You start it.."

100
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:57,589
"You start playing the song of love.."

101
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:02,125
"You start playing the song of love.."

102
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:06,509
"Listening to which
this heart sways.."

103
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:11,637
"Listening to which this heart sways,
lover become crazy.."

104
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:14,257
"We lovers become crazy.."

105
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:18,790
"You start playing the song of love.."

106
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,633
"You start playing the song of love.."

107
00:13:52,768 --> 00:14:00,379
"A beautiful girl will
come into my dreams one day.."

108
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:09,828
"She will talk coyly,
she will steal my sleep.."

109
00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:15,526
"She will torment
she will make me yearn.."

110
00:14:15,883 --> 00:14:20,575
"She will give me some pain.."

111
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:25,634
"She will smilingly torture us.."

112
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:28,131
"You start it.."

113
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:32,953
"You start it.."

114
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:39,636
"You start playing the song of love.."

115
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:44,101
"You start playing the song of love.."

116
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:48,819
"Listening to which
this heart sways.."

117
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:53,782
"Listening to which this heart sways,
lover become crazy.."

118
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:56,517
"We lovers become crazy.."

119
00:14:56,674 --> 00:15:00,863
"You start playing the song of love.."

120
00:15:01,372 --> 00:15:05,718
"You start playing the song of love.."

121
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:25,882
Hey, who is it?

122
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:32,490
Brother.

123
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:38,745
Sapna, go and sit in the car.
- But, brother..

124
00:15:38,825 --> 00:15:39,985
I said go and sit in the car!

125
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:45,360
Hi!

126
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:51,095
What fun! This is Bruce Lee!
This is Jackie Chan!

127
00:15:51,296 --> 00:15:53,652
This is Shahrukh Khan!
This is Salman Khan!

128
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,359
What was this?

129
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,649
Dharmendra.

130
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:02,443
I don't want to play with you.

131
00:16:02,523 --> 00:16:04,735
You punch me so badly
like Dharmendra.

132
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:06,735
Sorry.
- No, sorry.

133
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:07,902
If you want to apologize,
then give me 100 rupees.

134
00:16:07,985 --> 00:16:09,069
Take this.

135
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:13,027
Is it okay?
- Okay.

136
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,152
Okay.
- Chandar.

137
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:20,735
At this age only you need men!

138
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:25,652
Brother, I love Kailash.
And I want to marry him.

139
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,187
I'll take decisions of your life!
Understood?

140
00:16:32,764 --> 00:16:36,360
Yes. This task is so difficult.
It is very risky.

141
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:38,069
Yes. Her brother is an inspector.

142
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,989
But he was suspended.

143
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:41,277
It means without throwing
the weight of him..

144
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,860
..being in the police,
he thrashed Kailash badly.

145
00:16:43,108 --> 00:16:47,110
Hang on. I have.. thank you.

146
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,384
I have a superb plan.
Let Sapna marry.

147
00:16:51,522 --> 00:16:52,735
What are you saying!
- Listen to me.

148
00:16:52,954 --> 00:16:55,424
There is a Sapna who
lives in my building.

149
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:59,651
We'll fix her up with him.
So Kailash will have Sapna.

150
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,694
And we won't have
to do anything too.

151
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:02,860
Great! Superb!

152
00:17:02,944 --> 00:17:05,569
Hang on. Hang on.
We'll abduct Sapna.

153
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:06,902
What!
- You're mad!

154
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:13,171
Listen. Tomorrow is my sister's wedding.

155
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,654
That guy will surely make
the mistake of coming here.

156
00:17:16,277 --> 00:17:17,777
Break that rascal's hands and legs.

157
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,860
And I'll handle everything later.

158
00:17:22,117 --> 00:17:24,360
Chandar, there is tension here.
- Tension?

159
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,947
Yes. That inspector has hired goons.

160
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:31,790
Hey, where are you going?
- Hey, go upstairs.

161
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:35,456
Look Pooja. Go and explain to Sapna.

162
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:39,360
Tell her to marry the guy
whom I've chosen for her.

163
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:42,859
If she refused,
then the consequence will be bad.

164
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:44,652
You understood what you have to do?
- Yes.

165
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:45,819
All the best.
- Okay.

166
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:51,073
Sapna, what will you do?
- I don't know.

167
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:18,360
Rascal!

168
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:30,360
If you are a true man,
then stay there.

169
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:36,819
Yes. I'm a true man.

170
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:41,860
You just come down.
I won't spare you.

171
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,360
Rascal!

172
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:45,463
Catch them!

173
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,930
Come. Come.

174
00:18:51,786 --> 00:18:53,006
Come on, let's go.

175
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:03,027
Stop! Stop..

176
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:06,985
Who is Sapna? Who is Sapna?
- She.

177
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:09,402
I'm Sapna.
- Come on, hurry up. Let's go. Come on.

178
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:10,652
Come on. Let's go.
- Come.

179
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:16,096
Oh no!

180
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:40,277
Come on. Run! I said run! Come on!

181
00:19:54,774 --> 00:19:55,492
Duck!

182
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,485
Pooja, hurry up! Let's run!

183
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,569
You! You hit a girl!

184
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:26,064
Sorry, sir.

185
00:20:27,128 --> 00:20:31,980
Sorry! Sorry..

186
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:37,435
Are you okay? Are you okay!
- Yeah.

187
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:39,610
Then, come on. Come on, let's run!
- Come.

188
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:01,444
No, Chandar. He is my brother.
Let's go from here.

189
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,110
Chandar, let's go.
- Please, let's go.

190
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:04,485
Come on, hurry up.

191
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:14,902
Welcome. Welcome.

192
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:16,694
Congratulations, Kailash.

193
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,069
Bathroom is over there.

194
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,277
I'm welcoming them.
- What is this?

195
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:24,050
Give an offering of 500 rupees only
then you can enter the house.

196
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,322
500?
- Yes.

197
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:28,069
This is women's duty.
But no problem.

198
00:21:30,303 --> 00:21:31,911
Now say.

199
00:21:32,577 --> 00:21:36,569
I can do anything for 500 rupees,
even be a woman.

200
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:39,485
Give me 500 rupees.

201
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:42,480
500 rupees is nothing.
Take 1000 rupees.

202
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,319
May your pair always be protected!

203
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:47,694
May God give you a long
life! Hey, Kamala..

204
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,194
He has brought the police
along with him.

205
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:00,444
Don't worry. Relax.

206
00:22:04,277 --> 00:22:09,027
Brother, I married him with my own will.
Don't create a scene here.

207
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:11,735
And don't try to ruin our happiness.

208
00:22:18,444 --> 00:22:20,569
Don't think that the story is over.

209
00:22:21,444 --> 00:22:23,839
Henceforth be cautious from me.

210
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:30,277
The day I get a hold on you..
I'll kill you.

211
00:22:33,447 --> 00:22:34,459
Best of luck.

212
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:42,110
Inspector sir.

213
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:47,610
Look, my pant is lying
outside your house.

214
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:49,944
Dry clean it and send it to me.

215
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:53,735
I'm wearing a loincloth.
Does it look good?

216
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:57,697
You!
- Sir, no! Sir, no!

217
00:22:57,905 --> 00:22:59,110
Sir, no!
- Leave me!

218
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:07,071
Did I say something wrong?

219
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:13,737
Did you like our arrangement?
- It's great.

220
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,881
Isn't it nice?
- Hey, what are you doing? Get out.

221
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,429
Come, Kailash. You too come with us.

222
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:18,980
Hey, where are you taking him?
You all leave.

223
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,762
You too come.
- Yes, we're leaving. Come..

224
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:23,554
Okay, Kailash.
I wish you all the best.

225
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:25,575
And take care of yourself. Okay.
- Thank you very much.

226
00:23:25,912 --> 00:23:28,615
Chandar. Thanks for everything.

227
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,459
Hey, don't be emotional. Okay.

228
00:23:31,902 --> 00:23:33,264
I wish you a happy married life.

229
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:34,726
Take care.

230
00:23:36,274 --> 00:23:37,312
Take care.

231
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:44,613
Jasbeer.
- Yes, Chandar.

232
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:47,321
Listen. You take 4 of them with
you in the car. - Okay.

233
00:23:47,404 --> 00:23:49,238
And for the rest.. take this.
Leave them in a cab.

234
00:23:49,321 --> 00:23:50,342
Okay.
- Bye, Chandar.

235
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:51,847
Take care.
- Bye. See you.

236
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:54,203
Bye.
- Bye.

237
00:23:57,234 --> 00:23:59,779
Excuse me, can you please
drop me home?

238
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,524
Yes, he'll drop you.

239
00:24:01,863 --> 00:24:02,946
But I don't know her address.

240
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:04,279
She must be residing near your home.

241
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:05,641
Ask somebody on the
road for the address.

242
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:06,907
You go and sit in the car.

243
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:08,374
Thanks.

244
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:11,789
Where have you got me stuck!
- I've given you a chance.

245
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:14,256
Stop the car in some isolated spot.
- Shut up.

246
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:16,016
Aren't you ashamed
to say such things?

247
00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:21,238
Alert! Be alert! To contact you..

248
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:26,321
My contact number is 6392848.
- 6392871.

249
00:24:26,404 --> 00:24:27,488
48..
- Alert!

250
00:24:27,571 --> 00:24:30,385
48, buddy. I'm sick of his
habit of forgetting.

251
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:42,463
So where do you live?

252
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,519
GM road. I mean.. MG road.
Bungalow no 27. - Okay.

253
00:24:50,374 --> 00:24:52,748
Do you mind if I play some music?
- No.

254
00:25:01,782 --> 00:25:02,712
We've reached my house.

255
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:10,893
Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

256
00:25:14,363 --> 00:25:15,587
My name is Pooja.

257
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:17,873
Nice meeting you.

258
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:21,596
I want to..
- Okay, bye.

259
00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:24,936
Bye.

260
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:52,238
Hey! Wait! I've got it for you! Wait!

261
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:53,973
I've got your favourite biscuits.

262
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:57,866
Take this. Eat it. Well done, buddy.

263
00:25:58,075 --> 00:26:02,779
How is dad's mood?
Tell me. How is it?

264
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:06,447
Where are you going? Answer me.

265
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:15,891
A red cap. Meaning dad is angry.

266
00:26:17,946 --> 00:26:22,276
Oh my God! Now how will
I go inside my house?

267
00:26:23,196 --> 00:26:25,196
Hey! Where are you going?

268
00:26:27,363 --> 00:26:28,946
What are you digging?

269
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:32,896
Hey! Rocky!

270
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:37,363
Well done, buddy! Well done!

271
00:26:49,613 --> 00:26:53,227
Dad! You!
- Yes, your father.

272
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:56,617
You're a thief. And your buddy
dog is also a thief.

273
00:26:56,863 --> 00:26:58,699
You'll get one spanking.
And he will get 2.

274
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:00,363
One.. two.. get lost.

275
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:03,946
Like Shammi Kapoor of
'Dil tera diwana'..

276
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:06,154
..you were secretly
entering your house.

277
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:07,529
And you thought that
I'll not come to know?

278
00:27:07,613 --> 00:27:09,446
Dad, I'm famished.
Please give me chicken or mutton.

279
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:11,821
Forget meals! I'll not spare you!
- But, dad.

280
00:27:11,904 --> 00:27:13,946
Shut up! First with your friends' help..

281
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:16,647
..you abduct a suspended
inspector's sister.

282
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:18,738
Then you get her married
with her lover.

283
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:19,988
Am I a lawyer or you!

284
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,050
You should have told me.

285
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,571
I would have lawfully
solved everything.

286
00:27:22,654 --> 00:27:24,563
Hang on! Hang on!
- What happened?

287
00:27:25,113 --> 00:27:29,101
When you're serious,
you look just like Dilip Kumar.

288
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:31,074
"Our eyes met."

289
00:27:31,154 --> 00:27:32,485
Really?
- Correct.

290
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:34,240
But I want to ask you..

291
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:37,051
With those worry lines
on your forehead..

292
00:27:37,218 --> 00:27:38,533
..you look just like Raj Kappor.

293
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:43,854
Like in 'Sangam'.
- No, 'Shri 420'.

294
00:27:47,272 --> 00:27:48,255
My son.

295
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:52,330
How many bottles of alcohol
have you drunk?

296
00:27:53,613 --> 00:27:55,112
One?
- Dozen.

297
00:27:55,762 --> 00:27:59,946
What one dozen! Are you mad!
Go and take a bath! Go!

298
00:28:09,026 --> 00:28:18,583
"There is no lover like you.."

299
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:29,302
"You are the identity of love.."

300
00:28:58,384 --> 00:29:08,885
"I see love in your eyes,
I see you as a lover, a beloved.."

301
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:22,975
"I see love in your eyes,
I see you as a lover, a beloved.."

302
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:27,555
"O my beloved, I swear on your love.."

303
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:36,351
"O my beloved, I swear on your love,
I see a friend who could die for love.."

304
00:29:36,431 --> 00:29:47,028
"I see love in your eyes,
I see an innocent acceptance.."

305
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:25,930
"Now I wish I remain lost,
I keep sleeping in your arms.."

306
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:30,279
"I too feel like straightening
your entangled hair.."

307
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:34,205
"..and keep drowning
in those blue eyes.."

308
00:30:34,285 --> 00:30:43,457
"Let there be no more
distances between us.."

309
00:30:43,851 --> 00:30:49,165
"There is peace in restlessness too.."

310
00:30:49,245 --> 00:30:54,701
"I see an innocent acceptance.."

311
00:30:54,781 --> 00:31:05,123
"I see love in your eyes,
I see you as a lover, a beloved.."

312
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:09,793
"O my beloved, I swear on your love.."

313
00:31:09,873 --> 00:31:14,162
"O my beloved, I swear on your love.."

314
00:31:14,242 --> 00:31:18,525
"I see a friend who
could die for love.."

315
00:31:18,605 --> 00:31:29,209
"I see love in your eyes,
I see you as a lover, a beloved.."

316
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,832
6392848.

317
00:32:15,874 --> 00:32:18,498
Should I eat apple or banana?
Apple or banana?

318
00:32:18,582 --> 00:32:24,998
Hello. Hello.. hello.. hello..

319
00:32:25,663 --> 00:32:26,563
God knows who it is!

320
00:32:26,998 --> 00:32:29,363
What happened, dad!
You disconnected the call!

321
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:30,638
Who was she?

322
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:33,036
Aren't you ashamed to talk
to your dad like this?

323
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:36,847
Dad, we're cooperative kids of
Navjeen co-operative housing society.

324
00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:40,332
Shall we find a girlfriend for you?

325
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:45,248
Shut up! It's a sin to think about this!
Fool! Idiots!

326
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:48,748
"It is my first love."

327
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,174
Hello.

328
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:53,020
Hello..

329
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:55,524
Hello..

330
00:32:56,714 --> 00:32:57,583
Hello.

331
00:33:01,949 --> 00:33:03,526
Who?
- I.

332
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,781
Who I?

333
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,881
I meaning I.
- Whom do you want?

334
00:33:10,176 --> 00:33:11,998
Chandu.
- Sorry, wrong number.

335
00:33:12,082 --> 00:33:14,256
There is no Chandu here.
My name is Chandar.

336
00:33:14,611 --> 00:33:20,317
I know. But I like Chandu.
And I'll call you Chandu only.

337
00:33:20,574 --> 00:33:21,529
But who are you?

338
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:23,970
Dream girl.

339
00:33:24,415 --> 00:33:25,232
Dream girl?

340
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:28,808
Yes. Dream girl.

341
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,459
Strange. I don't even know you.

342
00:33:31,714 --> 00:33:33,596
But I know everything about you.

343
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:35,082
Your name is Chandar Kapoor.

344
00:33:35,165 --> 00:33:36,665
Your father's name is
Dilip Dev Kapoor.

345
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,332
He is an advocate,
civil and criminal.

346
00:33:38,495 --> 00:33:41,955
Your height is 5'11.
And your weight is 72 kgs. Correct?

347
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:46,544
Yes. Correct. - Hey, Chandu.
Why are you scratching your head?

348
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,707
A beautiful young girl
is talking to you.

349
00:33:52,327 --> 00:33:55,726
Talk romantically.
Like darling, let's go to Juhu beach.

350
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:58,854
Let's go for coffee.
Will you come to Khandala?

351
00:33:59,108 --> 00:34:00,846
Hey, what are you saying!

352
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,167
I'm talking about my heart.
- Pooja!

353
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,665
Oh my God! Daddy.
Chandu, okay.. bye.

354
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:09,608
Hello..

355
00:34:13,082 --> 00:34:15,248
Who is this dream girl?
- I don't know.

356
00:34:15,332 --> 00:34:17,498
But I can find out.
Give me 2000 rupees.

357
00:34:17,582 --> 00:34:18,665
Close your eyes.
- Yes.

358
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,748
This was 1000 on one cheek.
And 1000 more on the other cheek.

359
00:34:23,832 --> 00:34:25,185
No! No!
- Where are you running!

360
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,106
Here, sir. One more card for 2000.

361
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,425
Don't take the cards.
First keep the money.

362
00:34:32,582 --> 00:34:34,539
Yes, I'll give you.
First play the game.

363
00:34:34,915 --> 00:34:37,291
You don't have money
and you're playing.

364
00:34:37,623 --> 00:34:41,540
Now show.
- Here. 5, 6, 7.

365
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:45,436
Stop! Ace, 3, 2.

366
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:47,248
Oh shit!

367
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:48,342
What about the money?

368
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:50,248
I'll pay you later.
- Sit!

369
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,915
Did you fill in the petrol?
- No, I filled it with oil.

370
00:34:54,998 --> 00:34:58,107
What rubbish!
- Take your old car away from here!

371
00:34:58,942 --> 00:35:00,032
Chandar.

372
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:06,464
Hey. Hey, quickly fill in the petrol.

373
00:35:06,964 --> 00:35:08,656
How many litres, sir?

374
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,915
When did you open this pump?

375
00:35:12,998 --> 00:35:17,869
No, I lost 2000 rupees in gambling
with a petrol pump owner.

376
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,040
And he has told me to work
here to pay off the debts.

377
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,123
How many times
I've told you not to gamble.

378
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:26,165
Even Pandavas had lost
Draupati in gambling.

379
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:28,096
Today I've lost.
But tomorrow I'll win.

380
00:35:37,334 --> 00:35:40,710
Yes, I'll fill in.
Everyday you quarrel.

381
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:42,329
He won't reform.

382
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:45,540
Hello, Jai speaking.
- Hello, give the phone to Chandar.

383
00:35:45,915 --> 00:35:48,667
You don't want to talk to Jai.
- Hey, cockroach.

384
00:35:50,332 --> 00:35:52,788
Quickly give the phone to Chandar.
- Yes.

385
00:35:53,457 --> 00:35:55,373
Hey Chandar... A call for you.
- For me?

386
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:57,726
Yes. Some girl..
who calls you cockroach.

387
00:35:58,439 --> 00:35:58,998
Hello.

388
00:36:00,554 --> 00:36:01,915
Hi, Chandu.

389
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:10,415
You?
- Yes. Sweetheart. You're filling petrol?

390
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:11,748
Yes.

391
00:36:12,498 --> 00:36:15,654
But without petrol,
you've set my heart ablaze..

392
00:36:16,075 --> 00:36:17,790
..and even the ocean can't douse it.

393
00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:20,720
Hey, don't you have any other work?

394
00:36:21,688 --> 00:36:26,207
Yes. To bring you closer to me.
To make you mine.

395
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:27,373
What do you mean?

396
00:36:28,131 --> 00:36:33,826
I mean.. wherever you go,
my shadow will be with you.

397
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:38,835
What? - You're body,
I'm the shadow. Don't believe me?

398
00:36:38,915 --> 00:36:40,149
Look on the ground.

399
00:36:51,006 --> 00:36:55,778
Oh, my Chandu.
You can't find me so easily. Bye.

400
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,207
Who was she?
- I don't know.

401
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,337
For God's sake, give me something.

402
00:37:01,537 --> 00:37:03,467
Here, take 100 rupees.

403
00:37:04,082 --> 00:37:08,317
Don't ever give me 100 rupees, dear.
- Why?

404
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:11,002
Even I used to give
100 rupees as alms.

405
00:37:11,082 --> 00:37:12,707
Now look what condition I am in.

406
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:20,057
Does anybody speak the truth
in today's world? Fool!

407
00:37:20,244 --> 00:37:22,271
You're a beggar.
And you'll die as a beggar.

408
00:37:22,444 --> 00:37:23,765
You will get a tail.

409
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:30,957
What is this?
- Soda.

410
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:33,665
Where is the bottle?
- In that room.

411
00:37:33,748 --> 00:37:35,215
Where is the bottle!

412
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,290
You spoilt my mood!
Is this a house or hell!

413
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,415
Nobody cares for me!

414
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:45,856
And what do you care for?
Only your alcohol.

415
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:47,915
In spite of being the managing
director of the company..

416
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:49,508
..you didn't come for the meeting.

417
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:52,802
All the members were asking
why your husband hasn't come.

418
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:54,801
I was humiliated.

419
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:59,627
So you don't regret my not
coming for the meeting.

420
00:37:59,707 --> 00:38:04,748
You regret somebody asking
why have I come.

421
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:08,425
I spite my fate for giving
me such a husband.

422
00:38:08,915 --> 00:38:10,963
You're my husband just for namesake.

423
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,415
You are as good as not being there.

424
00:38:13,498 --> 00:38:15,149
What did you say! What did you say!

425
00:38:24,332 --> 00:38:26,905
What are you doing! Get lost!

426
00:38:30,748 --> 00:38:37,127
The match is beginning.
Here is the first ball.

427
00:38:37,207 --> 00:38:38,540
Chandar, throw the ball quickly.

428
00:38:38,623 --> 00:38:40,665
Chandar, throw the ball fast.
- What are you doing?

429
00:38:42,038 --> 00:38:45,457
Here comes the son..
and he threw the ball.

430
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,332
Out! Out..
- No!

431
00:38:47,587 --> 00:38:53,353
No! No..
- Out!

432
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:54,582
Ask the umpire.

433
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,790
Say out for LBW.

434
00:39:00,265 --> 00:39:01,953
I'll not spare you if you give out.

435
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:05,869
If you don't give LBW,
then I'll stop your quota of milk and bread.

436
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:09,915
And if you out me,
then I'll throw you out of the house.

437
00:39:18,415 --> 00:39:21,236
Look at this, match fixing has
started on the streets too.

438
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:26,582
Dear, for my sake,
give me one more chance. - No..

439
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,540
No, no dad.
Don't make me emotional. Okay.

440
00:39:28,623 --> 00:39:29,707
Okay.
- Last chance.

441
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,915
Okay. Second last chance.
- Dad!

442
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:33,415
Okay, last chance. Let's continue.

443
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,915
Out! Out! Out..

444
00:39:56,998 --> 00:40:01,915
Out!
- No! I disagree!

445
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:03,759
You're out!

446
00:40:04,457 --> 00:40:07,135
Hello.
- Hello, Chandu.

447
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:13,017
You look so sexy in half pants.

448
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,915
Why are you feeling shy like a girl?

449
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,290
From where are you calling?
Why don't you appear before me?

450
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,540
I'm love. I can't be seen.

451
00:40:24,373 --> 00:40:26,373
Look, have mercy on me and
disconnect the call.

452
00:40:26,582 --> 00:40:27,748
And please let me play.

453
00:40:28,582 --> 00:40:31,415
Hey Chandu, why are you playing
cricket like a kid?

454
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:36,165
If you want to play,
then play with my long black tresses.

455
00:40:37,165 --> 00:40:39,540
Play with my silky veil.

456
00:40:40,623 --> 00:40:44,207
Come in my dreams and
play with my thoughts.

457
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:53,707
Chandu, you're listening to my romantic
talks with so much interest.

458
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:57,957
No, this is not so.
- You liar!

459
00:40:58,465 --> 00:41:01,748
I know that even your
heart is tickling.

460
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,915
So you fell in love with me.
- No, I didn't fell.

461
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,546
What if I make you fall?
- No, you can't.

462
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:11,347
Shall I make you fall?
- Go ahead.

463
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:12,332
So take this.

464
00:41:15,485 --> 00:41:16,790
Oh my God!

465
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,405
So Chandu, you fell.
- Yes.

466
00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:27,339
Shit!

467
00:41:28,707 --> 00:41:31,998
Yippee! Chandar,
your problem is solved.

468
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:33,332
Look at this, caller ID.

469
00:41:34,123 --> 00:41:35,207
Now when your dream girl will call..

470
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,498
..then we'll come
to know her number.

471
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:40,207
And she will be caught.
- Wow! What an idea!

472
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,740
Yes, give me 2000 rupees.
- How much will you rob me!

473
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,764
You take all my pocket money.

474
00:41:47,044 --> 00:41:47,743
Hello.

475
00:41:48,123 --> 00:41:49,915
It is not telephone ring,
but the doorbell.

476
00:41:54,108 --> 00:41:54,998
Harmeet, you?

477
00:41:55,078 --> 00:41:57,955
Yes. Chandar,
is your telephone working?

478
00:41:58,248 --> 00:41:59,707
There is a call for you on my phone.

479
00:41:59,844 --> 00:42:01,332
My call on your phone?
- Yes.

480
00:42:01,754 --> 00:42:02,915
Give it to me.
- Go ahead and talk.

481
00:42:03,668 --> 00:42:05,497
Hello.
- Hi, Chandu.

482
00:42:06,134 --> 00:42:07,815
You want to know my number?

483
00:42:08,086 --> 00:42:09,607
You've installed caller ID.

484
00:42:11,168 --> 00:42:13,998
What happened?
- She is smarter than us.

485
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:16,518
She knows that we've installed
caller ID. - Shit!

486
00:42:17,457 --> 00:42:22,212
Chandu, you're eager to meet me,
aren't you?

487
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:26,302
No, no, no. This is not true.

488
00:42:26,457 --> 00:42:29,248
Yes it is true.
Now write down my number.

489
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:31,915
Jai, write down the number quickly.
- Yes.

490
00:42:31,998 --> 00:42:34,806
Yes.
- 362436.

491
00:42:35,191 --> 00:42:39,290
362436. This number is of which area?

492
00:42:39,373 --> 00:42:42,005
This is her figure's number.

493
00:42:42,152 --> 00:42:42,963
What?
- Yes.

494
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,488
I hope you'll remember this number.

495
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:51,957
Good night. Sweet dreams.
Bye, Chandu.

496
00:42:53,584 --> 00:42:56,915
Hello. Hello.. dream girl..
dream girl.

497
00:42:56,998 --> 00:42:59,364
Chandar.. Chandar, what happened?

498
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:01,326
Nothing. She disconnected the call.

499
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:06,134
Chandar, what are you doing!

500
00:43:06,332 --> 00:43:07,623
You're banging the wall at night!

501
00:43:08,665 --> 00:43:09,748
I'll have to get him married now.

502
00:43:10,594 --> 00:43:11,863
Fool!

503
00:43:18,357 --> 00:43:21,308
Jai, tell me. How is it?
- It's superb. Buy it.

504
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:24,321
What is this? Remove it.
- I was doing the trial.

505
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,348
When will you reform!

506
00:43:25,428 --> 00:43:28,220
Yippee! I had nice fun.
- Where were you?

507
00:43:30,262 --> 00:43:32,988
Let me tell you something.
The bathroom here is strange.

508
00:43:33,223 --> 00:43:37,720
There is no tap or commode.
There is only mirror all around.

509
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:40,149
I did it on the ground only.
- What!

510
00:43:40,303 --> 00:43:42,723
Fool! You peed in the changing room.

511
00:43:43,095 --> 00:43:46,659
It was an emergency. So I did it.
- Well done.

512
00:43:49,387 --> 00:43:52,053
Chandar, Sapna's friend.
Let's go and talk to her.

513
00:43:52,137 --> 00:43:54,131
Are you mad!
- Yes. Hi!

514
00:43:58,282 --> 00:43:58,947
Hello.

515
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:05,873
Hello.

516
00:44:07,104 --> 00:44:07,754
Hello.

517
00:44:10,762 --> 00:44:15,137
She ran away.
She behaved as if she had never met you.

518
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:20,749
A wealthy girl always
behaves rudely.

519
00:44:21,053 --> 00:44:22,887
Paging for Chandar. Call for you.

520
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,803
Please come to the customer
service counter.

521
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,293
Call for me? I'll just come.

522
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:28,928
Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

523
00:44:29,012 --> 00:44:30,720
Is there a call for me?
- Are you Mr. Chandar?

524
00:44:30,803 --> 00:44:31,887
Yes.
- Here, sir.

525
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:34,778
Hello.
- Hey, Chandu.

526
00:44:37,036 --> 00:44:38,940
You?
- Yes.

527
00:44:39,352 --> 00:44:41,403
You're flirting with a girl
in the departmental store.

528
00:44:41,775 --> 00:44:44,303
First you greeted her,
then you showed your style.

529
00:44:44,763 --> 00:44:46,351
I'm keeping a watch on you.

530
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,904
Why? Are you jealous?

531
00:44:52,652 --> 00:44:58,358
Yes. If you even glanced at any
other girl, then I'll kill you.

532
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:01,603
Whatever. The girl was gorgeous.

533
00:45:02,152 --> 00:45:04,863
What tresses. What way of walk.

534
00:45:05,542 --> 00:45:08,102
I think so.. I love that girl.

535
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:14,150
Hey, if you see my beauty,
then you'll go mad.

536
00:45:14,436 --> 00:45:18,484
Really? So appear before me
and show me your beauty.

537
00:45:19,352 --> 00:45:23,294
Fine. I'll give you
my glimpse today.

538
00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:25,436
Turn around and see the mirror.

539
00:45:48,894 --> 00:45:51,186
So Chandu.. did you get a shock?

540
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:53,242
What do you want?

541
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:57,436
I.. I love you.

542
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:07,977
Chandu, I love you.

543
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:16,913
I love you, Chandu.

544
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:59,529
"O beautiful, I like your attitude.."

545
00:46:59,773 --> 00:47:04,084
"Your style sets me on fire.."

546
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:09,867
"O beautiful, I like your attitude.."

547
00:47:10,007 --> 00:47:14,748
"Your style sets me on fire.."

548
00:47:14,828 --> 00:47:19,651
"I love you, my heart says this.."

549
00:47:19,731 --> 00:47:24,922
"You stay in my heart.."

550
00:47:25,002 --> 00:47:30,151
"Your love flows in my breaths.."

551
00:47:30,231 --> 00:47:35,192
"O beautiful, I like your attitude.."

552
00:47:35,462 --> 00:47:41,219
"Your style sets me on fire.."

553
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:11,502
"Look what my heart says.."

554
00:48:13,962 --> 00:48:19,016
"Look what my heart says.."

555
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:24,206
"It lives on seeing you
and dies to see your face.."

556
00:48:24,286 --> 00:48:29,246
"Even I sigh when I'm
away from you beloved.."

557
00:48:29,326 --> 00:48:34,586
"My heart loves you,
but I am scared of saying it.."

558
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:38,846
"Saying this you have injured me.."

559
00:48:38,926 --> 00:48:44,446
"O beautiful, I like your attitude.."

560
00:48:44,759 --> 00:48:50,381
"Your style sets me on fire.."

561
00:49:05,259 --> 00:49:11,138
"There are many beauties
in the world but none like you.."

562
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:17,846
"There are many beauties
in the world but none like you.."

563
00:49:18,126 --> 00:49:23,166
"There must be many Majnu's
in this world, but none like me.."

564
00:49:23,246 --> 00:49:28,046
"Seeing your craziness,
I believe you.."

565
00:49:28,394 --> 00:49:33,286
"Your heart is of a true lover,
beloved, I've realized this.."

566
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:37,920
"In your love my dear,
I've become crazy.."

567
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,434
"O beautiful, I like your attitude.."

568
00:49:43,754 --> 00:49:48,566
"Your style sets me on fire.."

569
00:49:48,646 --> 00:49:53,380
"I love you, my heart says this.."

570
00:49:53,597 --> 00:49:58,597
"You stay in my heart.."

571
00:49:58,786 --> 00:50:03,326
"Your love flows in my breaths.."

572
00:50:03,406 --> 00:50:08,926
"O beautiful, I like your attitude.."

573
00:50:09,287 --> 00:50:14,666
"Your style sets me on fire.."

574
00:50:45,685 --> 00:50:47,102
'Chandu, I love you.'

575
00:50:48,156 --> 00:50:49,561
'I love you, Chandu.'

576
00:50:54,227 --> 00:50:55,561
'I love you.'

577
00:51:05,352 --> 00:51:06,894
'Chandu, I love you.'

578
00:51:09,935 --> 00:51:12,115
'I love you, Chandu.'

579
00:51:20,227 --> 00:51:22,897
Chandar dear,
bring the breakfast quickly.

580
00:51:23,059 --> 00:51:24,852
Stop. You've already eaten
a dozen bananas.

581
00:51:24,935 --> 00:51:26,823
Fine. I'll eat apples now.
- Put it down.

582
00:51:33,311 --> 00:51:35,708
Dear, here. Your father is here.

583
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,502
Learn. Learn from my son as
to how to serve your father.

584
00:51:39,582 --> 00:51:43,186
What sandwich you've made!
I'm sure it will be tasty.

585
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:44,597
God bless you. Thank you.

586
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:21,858
Yes. Use your strength.
- Haya..

587
00:52:23,754 --> 00:52:24,612
Continue eating.

588
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,980
Dear, was it hen's egg?

589
00:52:36,173 --> 00:52:38,186
Why? Did you feel that it
was a crocodile's egg?

590
00:52:38,269 --> 00:52:41,522
No, dinosaurs. Fool.
Where is my watch?

591
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:42,561
Here.

592
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:48,301
Son, this is egg, not watch.

593
00:52:49,657 --> 00:52:51,519
This is egg?
Then where is the omelette, dad?

594
00:52:52,352 --> 00:52:53,794
I eat that, son.

595
00:52:54,935 --> 00:52:57,676
I think along with the omelette I..

596
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,269
Why is the clock's alarm sound
coming from my stomach?

597
00:53:06,352 --> 00:53:07,436
Because you eat omelette.

598
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:10,178
What? You gave me watch
along with the omelette?

599
00:53:10,436 --> 00:53:11,519
Now how do I shut this alarm clock?

600
00:53:11,603 --> 00:53:12,970
It rings after every 15 minutes.

601
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:16,102
Do one thing. Eat banana.
It will come out till morning.

602
00:53:16,186 --> 00:53:17,423
Shut up! Shut up!

603
00:53:17,603 --> 00:53:19,935
Chandar, what has happened to you?

604
00:53:20,019 --> 00:53:22,311
He has lost his peace.
- He has fallen in love.

605
00:53:22,391 --> 00:53:23,719
You mean he is in love.
- Yes, sir.

606
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:26,359
Now I'll have to first
solve this case.

607
00:53:26,439 --> 00:53:27,943
Otherwise today he gave
me watch to eat..

608
00:53:28,023 --> 00:53:30,688
..tomorrow he'll give me fan,
then cupboard.

609
00:53:30,768 --> 00:53:31,852
And then one day the
furniture of this..

610
00:53:31,935 --> 00:53:33,019
..whole house will be in my stomach.

611
00:53:33,102 --> 00:53:34,685
No, it's dangerous thing.

612
00:53:34,768 --> 00:53:36,661
But who is this girl?
- I don't know.

613
00:53:36,741 --> 00:53:38,227
What's her name?
- I don't know, dad.

614
00:53:38,311 --> 00:53:40,019
Then have you fallen
in love with a ghost.

615
00:53:40,102 --> 00:53:41,477
You don't know her name,
her whereabouts.

616
00:53:41,561 --> 00:53:42,810
Where do you meet this girl?

617
00:53:42,894 --> 00:53:44,852
Her dream girl never
meets him, uncle.

618
00:53:44,935 --> 00:53:47,311
She just talks to him on the phone.

619
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:50,392
At what time does she calls?
- Every morning at 10 o'clock.

620
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,935
It's 10 o'clock.
But she has still not called.

621
00:53:54,144 --> 00:53:55,935
Here is her call.

622
00:53:56,019 --> 00:53:58,436
Today you won't talk.
Only I will talk.

623
00:53:58,519 --> 00:53:59,685
Now I'll make this girl
accept her love..

624
00:53:59,768 --> 00:54:02,269
..make her the daughter-in-law
of this house.

625
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:04,685
Daughter-in-law, father-in-law
is coming.

626
00:54:04,768 --> 00:54:06,186
Coming, coming, coming.

627
00:54:08,102 --> 00:54:11,040
Hello. Oh, sorry. Hello, dear.

628
00:54:11,269 --> 00:54:13,309
Hello. Give the phone to Chandu.

629
00:54:13,603 --> 00:54:16,269
Chandu is not at home.
He has gone for his marriage.

630
00:54:16,352 --> 00:54:20,013
Dad! - What! Chandu is getting married?
With whom?

631
00:54:20,317 --> 00:54:22,619
The girl who calls him day
and night. Dream girl.

632
00:54:22,769 --> 00:54:23,521
Oh no!

633
00:54:23,698 --> 00:54:26,198
But I'm that dream girl.

634
00:54:28,394 --> 00:54:31,894
Strange. You used to call him and
he is marrying somebody else.

635
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,227
Dad, what are you doing?

636
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,889
Let me handle this case.
And shut up.

637
00:54:35,128 --> 00:54:38,477
Yes. - I won't let this happen.
I love Chandu.

638
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:41,254
Do you have any evidence of love?
- No.

639
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,147
Any eye witness?
- No.

640
00:54:43,365 --> 00:54:44,939
Any agreement of love?
- No!

641
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,436
Then you've lost this case.
And another girl wins.

642
00:54:48,648 --> 00:54:49,227
What do you mean?

643
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,367
Dad...

644
00:54:50,603 --> 00:54:52,894
I mean that Chandar is going
to marry in Anand Hall.

645
00:54:52,977 --> 00:54:54,887
Within an hour his wedding
night will begin.

646
00:54:54,967 --> 00:54:57,108
I can't give any more information.
Bye, thank you.

647
00:54:57,188 --> 00:54:57,959
Are you mad!

648
00:54:58,039 --> 00:55:00,436
Dad, you destroyed my home
even before it was settled.

649
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:03,500
In fact I helped you.
Now look how she'll run and come.

650
00:55:05,144 --> 00:55:09,685
I'll see how he gets married.

651
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:13,477
Dear, where are you going?

652
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:15,768
Granny, sit in the car. I'll tell you.
- Fine.

653
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:22,277
Dad.
- Yes.

654
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:24,523
At last I'm going to get married.

655
00:55:24,603 --> 00:55:26,685
Dear, whenever I try
to get you married..

656
00:55:26,768 --> 00:55:29,304
..there is always a hurdle.

657
00:55:29,613 --> 00:55:30,436
Will it happen today too?

658
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:32,102
What?
- Nothing. - Nothing.

659
00:55:32,186 --> 00:55:33,624
No, something is surely wrong.

660
00:55:33,768 --> 00:55:36,019
I'm the bride's father.
I have the right to know.

661
00:55:36,102 --> 00:55:38,782
No, actually the matter is that
whenever I try to get him married..

662
00:55:38,862 --> 00:55:40,022
..there is always some hurdle.

663
00:55:40,102 --> 00:55:41,708
He was supposed to get
married in Bihar.

664
00:55:41,788 --> 00:55:44,227
There was a flood there and the
bride and her parents died.

665
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:46,633
What! - He was going to
get married at Lathure.

666
00:55:46,713 --> 00:55:47,561
And there was an earthquake.

667
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:50,486
Many people got buried and
they are still not found.

668
00:55:50,566 --> 00:55:51,679
O my God!

669
00:55:51,759 --> 00:55:53,357
He was going to get
married in Mumbai.

670
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:54,998
There was a bomb blast and
everybody disappeared.

671
00:55:55,257 --> 00:55:59,170
O my God! Why didn't you
tell me this before?

672
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,632
If we'd told you this before, then
wouldn't you have run away?

673
00:56:00,712 --> 00:56:02,603
What?
- It is his fate. - Yes.

674
00:56:02,684 --> 00:56:04,685
But if something like
this happens here..

675
00:56:04,765 --> 00:56:07,105
..then I will be ruined.

676
00:56:07,185 --> 00:56:08,144
You will be ruined only once.

677
00:56:08,227 --> 00:56:09,707
We have been ruined so many times.
- What!

678
00:56:09,994 --> 00:56:11,788
Today nothing bad will happen.

679
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,685
Pundit-ji has said till
the time we don't show..

680
00:56:13,768 --> 00:56:16,186
..his unlucky face to anybody,
it will be auspicious time.

681
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:17,436
Son, wear this flowery veil.

682
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:21,567
Yes, wear it. Otherwise flood,
earthquake, bomb blast..

683
00:56:22,935 --> 00:56:24,563
What happened? What happened?

684
00:56:25,603 --> 00:56:28,805
Nothing, my bald father-in-law.

685
00:56:29,089 --> 00:56:31,685
Guests are bursting
crackers outside.

686
00:56:31,768 --> 00:56:35,231
Okay.
- Good luck. Good luck. Good luck.

687
00:56:35,311 --> 00:56:37,799
How are you laughing? Continue.

688
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:39,605
Greetings!
- Greetings!

689
00:56:39,685 --> 00:56:41,417
How are you?
How is everybody at home? - Dad.

690
00:56:41,497 --> 00:56:42,949
Greetings.
- Hello.

691
00:56:43,115 --> 00:56:44,582
Greetings!
- Greetings!

692
00:56:46,156 --> 00:56:48,329
Come. Careful. Careful.

693
00:56:56,932 --> 00:56:58,777
From where do you buy your grocery?

694
00:56:59,229 --> 00:57:04,805
One shop is not sufficient.
So I have to buy it from 2-3 shops.

695
00:57:07,603 --> 00:57:08,975
You are very healthy.

696
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:11,612
After marriage you will
have to control yourself.

697
00:57:14,907 --> 00:57:15,977
You used to sleep
in every marriage..

698
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:16,897
..and you used to
make me stay awake.

699
00:57:16,977 --> 00:57:19,363
Before anything bad happens,
start reading the mantras.

700
00:57:20,302 --> 00:57:22,227
You stay here.
I'll go and handle him.

701
00:57:22,311 --> 00:57:24,272
But granny, how will
you recognise him?

702
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,436
Of course I'll recognise him.

703
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:27,351
That fool must be wearing
the flowery veil.

704
00:57:33,685 --> 00:57:36,065
Dad. How will you recognise her?

705
00:57:36,227 --> 00:57:40,048
I've given her a big shock.
She'll come and shout out your name.

706
00:57:40,366 --> 00:57:41,394
Chandar!

707
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:49,330
Son, what is this?
- Dad.

708
00:57:49,477 --> 00:57:52,727
She's so old.
Is she your dream girl?

709
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:55,886
Uncle, she's not dream girl.
She's drum girl.

710
00:57:56,218 --> 00:58:00,586
Bad choice, Chandar. Bad choice.
- It happens.

711
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:05,149
Girl's voice might be sweet,
but in reality she's very sharp.

712
00:58:05,352 --> 00:58:06,436
Chandar!

713
00:58:06,768 --> 00:58:10,098
Hey, Chandar!
- What happened?

714
00:58:10,336 --> 00:58:13,139
Why are you hiding you face?
- Dad said not to show my face.

715
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:14,699
I'll not spare your dad.

716
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:16,647
You had an affair with
my granddaughter.

717
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:18,436
And for marriage, you
found another girl.

718
00:58:18,519 --> 00:58:20,505
I didn't choose the girl,
my dad did. Talk to him.

719
00:58:20,977 --> 00:58:23,293
You use do flirt with her on
the phone. What about that?

720
00:58:23,373 --> 00:58:27,231
Dad is the one who flirts
on the phone.

721
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:31,639
Now I understood.
You're dad's girlfriend. Dad, handle her.

722
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:32,603
The auspicious time of my
wedding is passing away.

723
00:58:32,684 --> 00:58:37,238
Idiot! I'll see how you marry.
You'll marry only dream girl.

724
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:40,229
Don't you love dream girl?

725
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:45,336
Hey, what a man you are! Pooja!
Pooja, come here!

726
00:58:45,416 --> 00:58:46,352
Come quickly.

727
00:58:46,436 --> 00:58:47,519
The auspicious time of my
wedding is passing away.

728
00:58:47,603 --> 00:58:47,973
Shut up!

729
00:58:58,606 --> 00:59:01,935
She is Sapna's friend.
- I like her.

730
00:59:02,019 --> 00:59:03,281
You're lucky, buddy.

731
00:59:04,561 --> 00:59:08,210
Pooja, look at him.
You were madly in love with him?

732
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:11,970
This disloyal fellow who's
marrying somebody else.

733
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:20,161
It is not his fault. Fault is mine.
I only was madly in love with him.

734
00:59:20,935 --> 00:59:24,326
The truth is that he never loved me.

735
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:27,300
I only was running after shadow.

736
00:59:30,996 --> 00:59:35,269
Stop! Let her suffer a bit more.
Then only will there be sweet union.

737
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:36,561
Dad.
- Shut up.

738
00:59:38,269 --> 00:59:42,837
Dad, shall I change the party?
- That fatso will not spare you.

739
00:59:42,917 --> 00:59:45,814
Dad, we have to take risk in love.

740
00:59:45,894 --> 00:59:47,766
Where are you going
forsaking me, darling?

741
00:59:49,047 --> 00:59:50,685
When a gorgeous girl is before me..

742
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:53,495
..then why will I marry
a witch like you?

743
00:59:54,269 --> 00:59:58,778
Hey, you'll have to
marry my daughter.

744
00:59:58,858 --> 01:00:03,344
Hey, you stay out of this.
Otherwise I'll not spare you.

745
01:00:03,424 --> 01:00:06,021
Now nobody can stop me.

746
01:00:06,533 --> 01:00:09,431
Forgive me, sister.
- Sister?

747
01:00:12,386 --> 01:00:18,558
Dear. - No, Chandar, no.
I thought you were a true lover.

748
01:00:19,477 --> 01:00:22,709
I'd thought that you can
do anything to have me.

749
01:00:23,685 --> 01:00:25,546
You'll love me a lot.

750
01:00:28,183 --> 01:00:32,113
You were everything for me.

751
01:00:34,977 --> 01:00:38,102
But today, you're going
to marry somebody else.

752
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:45,599
But I'll love you till the day I die.
I'll love you till I die.

753
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,685
I'll love you till I die.

754
01:00:49,751 --> 01:00:50,436
Chandar

755
01:00:53,685 --> 01:00:58,685
Dear, enough. Don't cry.

756
01:00:59,104 --> 01:01:04,048
Your each tear is an ocean for me.

757
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:07,032
And this Chandar has drowned in it.

758
01:01:08,085 --> 01:01:12,819
This is not love. It I love forever.

759
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:17,852
I'm your lover of many lifetimes.
Lover. Lover.

760
01:01:18,685 --> 01:01:19,768
Lover.

761
01:01:22,282 --> 01:01:26,068
Pooja, how did you fell in
love with this dark fellow?

762
01:01:26,405 --> 01:01:27,703
Didn't you find anybody else?

763
01:01:28,274 --> 01:01:33,489
I'm not a dark fellow.
I'm a dark melody.

764
01:01:34,685 --> 01:01:36,269
What happened? Pooja. Pooja.

765
01:01:36,352 --> 01:01:37,436
Hey, why are you shouting?

766
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:41,239
You're not Chandar.
- I'm Chandar. What happened?

767
01:01:41,611 --> 01:01:43,227
You're not my Chandar.

768
01:01:43,311 --> 01:01:45,295
What do you mean? I've
already left the bride.

769
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,980
Come, what are you doing?

770
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,117
Hey, don't touch me.
I'll break your head.

771
01:01:56,062 --> 01:01:56,979
Hey, dream girl.

772
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:20,002
Chandu, why did you play
this prank on me?

773
01:02:20,659 --> 01:02:23,239
You used to play pranks on
the phone, here I played.

774
01:02:23,747 --> 01:02:27,384
Now stop this game.
I found my daughter-in-law.

775
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:30,154
Now no need to romance
covertly on the phone.

776
01:02:30,234 --> 01:02:32,179
Whatever you want to do,
do it openly.

777
01:02:32,484 --> 01:02:34,318
You all can leave.
The wedding is cancelled.

778
01:02:34,401 --> 01:02:35,484
Dad.
- Very bad.

779
01:02:36,026 --> 01:02:38,184
Since the last 15 years, there
has been twist in my marriage.

780
01:02:38,526 --> 01:02:39,817
But this twist was great.

781
01:02:40,108 --> 01:02:41,276
Son, what will you do now?

782
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,279
Apologize to the old party.
What else?

783
01:02:43,622 --> 01:02:44,598
Does she think that I'm mad!

784
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:51,018
She was trying to fool me!
How did they come in?

785
01:02:51,276 --> 01:02:52,617
Who invited them in?

786
01:02:53,073 --> 01:02:55,121
They want to ruin an
innocent girl's life.

787
01:02:55,276 --> 01:02:58,172
We all should be ashamed!
You, I and she!

788
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:01,842
Come, my witch. I mean, beautiful.

789
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:06,876
Beautiful! I'll become
a witch and show you!

790
01:03:12,859 --> 01:03:15,511
Dad! She's a witch!

791
01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:22,234
They've become devils. Save us God!

792
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:25,318
Run, son. Otherwise they'll kill us.

793
01:04:17,213 --> 01:04:27,846
"O my beloved, my dear,
I am yours, I am lost in your love.."

794
01:04:27,926 --> 01:04:38,837
"O my beloved, my dear,
I am yours, I am lost in your love.."

795
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:49,752
"I swear on God, you swear on God,
we'll never leave each other.."

796
01:04:49,832 --> 01:04:54,093
"O my beloved.."

797
01:05:23,115 --> 01:05:28,549
"I am the King and you're the Queen.."

798
01:05:28,629 --> 01:05:33,575
"The love story should be such.."

799
01:05:34,182 --> 01:05:39,237
"There should be smiles on the lips.."

800
01:05:39,534 --> 01:05:44,143
"There shouldn't
be tears in the eyes.."

801
01:05:44,223 --> 01:05:49,521
"It stays in the heart,
the heart beat says.."

802
01:05:49,601 --> 01:05:54,940
"Say again,
all that you have said just now.."

803
01:05:55,020 --> 01:06:05,778
"O my beloved, my dear,
I am yours, I am lost in your love.."

804
01:06:05,858 --> 01:06:16,642
"O my beloved, my dear,
I am yours, I am lost in your love.."

805
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:27,453
"I swear on God, you swear on God,
we'll never leave each other.."

806
01:06:27,533 --> 01:06:30,206
"O my beloved.."

807
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:34,358
"My dear"

808
01:07:26,204 --> 01:07:29,220
Hey! What are you doing
here at midnight?

809
01:07:29,466 --> 01:07:33,687
Look, Mathur.
- Not Mathur. Say inspector Mathur.

810
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:38,306
From where have you abducted her?
She is hot.

811
01:07:46,731 --> 01:07:50,328
For grabbing the collar of
on duty police officer..

812
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:52,503
..I arrest you.

813
01:08:01,262 --> 01:08:02,241
Thank you, inspector.

814
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:06,583
Chandu!
- Come, rascal! Come!

815
01:08:06,663 --> 01:08:09,457
Hang on, inspector! Hang on. Please.

816
01:08:10,037 --> 01:08:13,352
I'm advocate, Kapoor.
And he is my son Chandar. - So?

817
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:16,040
Answer the call.
- What if I don't answer it?

818
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,516
Inspector, please answer the call.

819
01:08:17,596 --> 01:08:18,693
Subhedar-ji.

820
01:08:20,776 --> 01:08:24,011
Answer the call. Answer it.
Since when the phone is ringing.

821
01:08:24,091 --> 01:08:25,642
Maybe it's a call from superiors.

822
01:08:25,808 --> 01:08:27,328
With great difficulty I've
got you on duty again..

823
01:08:27,411 --> 01:08:29,403
..by requesting brother-in-law.

824
01:08:29,483 --> 01:08:31,238
Answer it. Fine. I'll answer it.

825
01:08:32,292 --> 01:08:34,574
Hello. Yes, brother-in-law.

826
01:08:34,769 --> 01:08:38,116
Yes, how are? Greetings.
How is my sister?

827
01:08:38,196 --> 01:08:39,662
Yes.. Fine.

828
01:08:40,048 --> 01:08:40,985
Who Subhedar-ji?

829
01:08:41,322 --> 01:08:45,821
Yes. Subhedar-ji, your father..
your superior's call.

830
01:08:45,905 --> 01:08:47,754
Have this. Come on, quickly.

831
01:08:49,404 --> 01:08:54,640
Sir, this is Mathur. But sir..
but I.. okay, sir.

832
01:08:55,738 --> 01:08:57,191
You may go.
- Come, son.

833
01:08:58,696 --> 01:09:01,047
Hey! You escaped from my
hand for the 2nd time.

834
01:09:01,327 --> 01:09:02,571
But it won't happen
for the 3rd time.

835
01:09:02,654 --> 01:09:05,518
Chandar! No, Chandar! Let's go.

836
01:09:06,738 --> 01:09:10,313
Subhedar-ji, listen to me and
don't lock horns with him.

837
01:09:10,571 --> 01:09:14,404
I think this guy is dangerous.
You might have to repent it.

838
01:09:14,487 --> 01:09:15,760
Bhawandar.
- Bhawandar.

839
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,404
Just shut up.
- Shut up. Okay.

840
01:09:17,613 --> 01:09:19,238
You come home late at night.

841
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,988
You openly romance with
a guy on the streets.

842
01:09:21,071 --> 01:09:22,571
You roam with cheap guys.

843
01:09:24,613 --> 01:09:26,416
This was bound to happen.
And why will it not happen?

844
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:29,155
After all you've raised her.
- Stop this taunt!

845
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:32,404
Pooja, if you marry any
guy without thinking..

846
01:09:32,487 --> 01:09:34,738
..then your plight will
be the same as mine.

847
01:09:34,821 --> 01:09:35,905
You shut up!

848
01:09:36,321 --> 01:09:39,952
Henceforth you won't meet that guy!
Understood!

849
01:09:40,322 --> 01:09:43,516
What does he have! Nothing!

850
01:09:44,568 --> 01:09:48,529
Daddy, what did you have
when you'd married mummy?

851
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,566
Ill-mannered! You argue with me!

852
01:09:53,779 --> 01:09:55,389
Now you won't leave this house!

853
01:09:55,949 --> 01:09:58,532
You'll stay here only!
This is my decision!

854
01:10:12,155 --> 01:10:14,155
Where is your son?
- He is not at home.

855
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:16,081
Tell him that Rudra had come.

856
01:10:16,529 --> 01:10:21,097
If he doesn't return my money in
a week, then I'll not spare him!

857
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,508
Understood!
- Yes.

858
01:10:22,882 --> 01:10:23,565
Come!

859
01:10:31,753 --> 01:10:32,863
What is all this, dear?

860
01:10:33,351 --> 01:10:34,779
Nothing. I'd lost some
money in gambling.

861
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:37,095
How many times I've told
you don't gamble.

862
01:10:37,288 --> 01:10:38,825
Now how will you repay this money?

863
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:41,370
Mother, you don't worry.
I'll repay it.

864
01:10:41,744 --> 01:10:42,738
Now where are you going?

865
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:44,395
To make the arrangements.
Where else?

866
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:55,828
Pooja.

867
01:10:59,702 --> 01:11:00,489
Chandu.

868
01:11:04,413 --> 01:11:05,497
Chandu.

869
01:11:11,608 --> 01:11:12,884
No, Pooja.
- Chandu.

870
01:11:13,342 --> 01:11:19,549
No. No, Pooja. Relax.
Relax. Come here.

871
01:11:25,287 --> 01:11:27,434
Did you get too much of scolding?
- Yes.

872
01:11:29,996 --> 01:11:31,157
Come on, Pooja.

873
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:35,076
Dream girl don't cry like this.

874
01:11:36,121 --> 01:11:39,829
Come on. I think you're
not my dream girl.

875
01:11:39,913 --> 01:11:40,996
Some other girl is my dream girl.

876
01:11:42,496 --> 01:11:44,749
Chandu. Chandu, are you fine?

877
01:11:44,829 --> 01:11:47,186
I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Chandu.

878
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,819
Are your parents at home?

879
01:11:51,485 --> 01:11:53,543
They've gone out.
- Fantastic!

880
01:11:53,993 --> 01:11:56,038
Quickly wear this dress and
get ready. We're going out.

881
01:11:56,121 --> 01:11:57,294
We can't go out.

882
01:11:57,374 --> 01:11:58,579
Mummy daddy will be
back within an hour.

883
01:11:58,662 --> 01:12:00,615
We'll be back before them.
Come on, now.

884
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:02,330
No, Chandu.
- Please.

885
01:12:03,121 --> 01:12:04,996
Okay. I'll quickly go and change.

886
01:12:05,842 --> 01:12:08,203
Change here only.
- What are you saying, Chandu?

887
01:12:08,644 --> 01:12:10,572
Why? Are you feeling
shy of the fishes?

888
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:15,226
No, I'm afraid of this crocodile.
Understood!

889
01:12:16,163 --> 01:12:20,457
Okay. But come quickly. We have
only an hour.. no 50 minutes..

890
01:12:20,674 --> 01:12:23,434
Come on, hurry up.. 40 minutes..
no 30 minutes.

891
01:12:23,514 --> 01:12:25,434
25 minutes.
Come on, Pooja. Hurry up.

892
01:12:25,514 --> 01:12:26,454
Chandu, please.

893
01:12:37,385 --> 01:12:41,039
Hey, dream girl. Looking gorgeous.

894
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:44,245
These earrings belonged
to my mother.

895
01:12:45,774 --> 01:12:47,536
It was her wish that her
daughter-in-law should wear it.

896
01:12:58,733 --> 01:12:59,912
Where have you brought me?

897
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,800
What's the time?
- Around 12 o'clock.

898
01:13:03,188 --> 01:13:03,870
Oh.

899
01:13:09,912 --> 01:13:12,037
What are you doing, Chandu?
- I'm just wiling away my time.

900
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,453
You could have done
that at home too.

901
01:13:13,536 --> 01:13:15,710
What was the need to come here?
Let's go home.

902
01:13:17,661 --> 01:13:20,453
Get out!
- Chandu, what prank is this!

903
01:13:20,987 --> 01:13:22,745
Not prank. Come out.

904
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,204
Chandu.
- Come out.

905
01:13:29,828 --> 01:13:32,245
Hold this.
- But.. - Hold this!

906
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:44,954
Happy birthday.. to Pooja.

907
01:13:45,484 --> 01:13:48,662
26th August. Happy birthday, Pooja.

908
01:15:08,578 --> 01:15:12,245
Chandu, nobody has loved me so much.

909
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:16,204
Even mummy daddy forgot that
today is my birthday.

910
01:15:17,287 --> 01:15:19,578
But you didn't forget.

911
01:15:20,662 --> 01:15:22,204
Always love me like this.

912
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:24,204
Always love me like this.

913
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,787
Never part with me, Chandu.
I won't be able to live without you.

914
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:35,079
I won't be able to live.
I won't be able to live.

915
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:37,703
I won't be able to live.

916
01:15:51,578 --> 01:15:53,495
Chandar! Chandar!

917
01:15:54,918 --> 01:15:58,832
Chandar, Pooja's parents are
getting Pooja engaged.

918
01:15:58,912 --> 01:16:01,329
And the guy's family has already
reached their home.

919
01:16:06,994 --> 01:16:08,411
Greetings.
- Greetings.

920
01:16:08,491 --> 01:16:10,204
Welcome. Greetings.

921
01:16:12,217 --> 01:16:13,328
Greetings, sister-in-law.
- Greetings.

922
01:16:13,408 --> 01:16:14,138
Hello, dear.
- Greetings.

923
01:16:14,218 --> 01:16:16,240
Did you have any problem
in coming here? - No.

924
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,719
Sit and have some sweets.
- Sure.

925
01:16:17,799 --> 01:16:19,112
Pooja's mother is bringing
Pooja here.

926
01:16:19,192 --> 01:16:20,227
Okay.
- They'll be here in 5 minutes.

927
01:16:20,387 --> 01:16:23,012
What nonsense!
The guy's family has come.

928
01:16:23,429 --> 01:16:24,950
Do you want to disgrace us?

929
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:26,962
Aren't you aware of
your father's anger?

930
01:16:29,721 --> 01:16:33,909
Yes, I know very well. You people
can do whatever you want.

931
01:16:34,429 --> 01:16:36,138
I'll not marry this guy.

932
01:16:38,554 --> 01:16:39,637
Chandar, listen to me!

933
01:16:43,471 --> 01:16:45,465
Hey, who is the bridegroom?

934
01:16:45,761 --> 01:16:47,340
Dear, he is the bridegroom.

935
01:16:47,721 --> 01:16:49,096
Get up. Get up!

936
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:56,220
Look, I and Pooja love
each other a lot.

937
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:58,220
And we've decided to get
married to each other.

938
01:16:59,019 --> 01:16:59,679
Understood!

939
01:17:00,598 --> 01:17:02,445
But Pooja's marriage
is fixed with me.

940
01:17:02,762 --> 01:17:06,971
You'll marry Pooja! Get out of here!

941
01:17:07,054 --> 01:17:09,679
Hey! A cheap lawyer's son!

942
01:17:10,138 --> 01:17:12,804
How dare you come here
and boss around!

943
01:17:14,242 --> 01:17:16,345
You've come to break my
daughter's marriage!

944
01:17:18,229 --> 01:17:20,387
I'll break your head! Rascal!

945
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:26,893
Hey, don't abuse!
- Yes, I'll do so! Rascal!

946
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:35,895
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

947
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:40,303
Chandar, what madness is this!
- Pooja, I was..

948
01:17:40,387 --> 01:17:41,983
How dare you touch my father!

949
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:43,155
Pooja, listen to me.

950
01:17:43,235 --> 01:17:46,662
I don't want to listen to anything!
Get out of here!

951
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:51,220
We've taken the oath to
live and die together.

952
01:17:52,012 --> 01:17:56,174
If you marry anyone else,
then I'll kill you.

953
01:17:56,887 --> 01:17:58,656
And I'll kill myself too.

954
01:18:07,846 --> 01:18:09,268
Why do you always misunderstand
things?

955
01:18:09,633 --> 01:18:11,220
She told you to go away
so as to stop..

956
01:18:11,303 --> 01:18:12,762
..your and her father's fight.

957
01:18:12,846 --> 01:18:14,976
I wasn't fighting,
his dad started it, dad.

958
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:16,971
But, son..
- He fell on his own.

959
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:20,451
And she was angry with me!
She told me to get out!

960
01:18:23,138 --> 01:18:25,932
Hello.
- Hello, Chandu..

961
01:18:26,012 --> 01:18:29,437
Don't you dare to call me again!
- Chandu.

962
01:18:31,429 --> 01:18:33,606
You say that Pooja didn't
stand by you.

963
01:18:34,138 --> 01:18:36,220
If tomorrow somebody comes
here and beat me..

964
01:18:36,303 --> 01:18:38,220
..will you do nothing?

965
01:18:38,303 --> 01:18:39,387
He has a point, Chandar.

966
01:18:42,713 --> 01:18:43,163
Hello.

967
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:45,637
Tell her to forget Chandar.

968
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,894
And marry the guy whom her
father has chosen for her.

969
01:18:48,303 --> 01:18:49,606
Chandar, listen to me.

970
01:18:49,805 --> 01:18:51,971
Hello, Chandu! Chandu!

971
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:54,138
Pooja, this is Jai, not Chandu.

972
01:18:54,303 --> 01:18:57,641
Jai, Jai, I want to meet Chandu.

973
01:18:57,721 --> 01:19:00,858
I want to talk to him urgently.
Please, Jai.

974
01:19:01,138 --> 01:19:04,016
Forget that. He doesn't even
want to listen to your name.

975
01:19:04,096 --> 01:19:05,386
He is very angry.

976
01:19:05,846 --> 01:19:09,138
No matter what, Jai. I want
to meet Chandu. Please.

977
01:19:12,429 --> 01:19:15,821
Okay, I'll fix up the meeting.
I'm coming to pick you up.

978
01:19:16,008 --> 01:19:16,929
Yes, right now.

979
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:55,012
Jai, where have you brought me?

980
01:19:55,336 --> 01:19:57,481
I'd told you that I want
to meet Chandu urgently.

981
01:19:58,429 --> 01:20:00,173
That's why I've got you here.

982
01:20:00,253 --> 01:20:03,515
Chandu is so angry that he can
do anything if he sees you.

983
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:06,220
I'd told Chandu's dad
to explain it to him..

984
01:20:06,303 --> 01:20:08,565
..let him cool down and
then get him here.

985
01:20:08,953 --> 01:20:10,721
Jai, the mistake is mine.

986
01:20:11,637 --> 01:20:15,220
I saw Chandu hitting dad and
I told him to get out.

987
01:20:15,846 --> 01:20:18,220
But grandma told me about
the misbehaviour..

988
01:20:18,303 --> 01:20:20,096
..that dad did with Chandu.

989
01:20:21,096 --> 01:20:24,365
So I want to meet Chandu
and apologize, Jai.

990
01:20:24,804 --> 01:20:26,475
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

991
01:20:27,138 --> 01:20:31,284
Jai, I'm worried.
God knows what will happen.

992
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:01,744
I'm sorry, Pooja.

993
01:21:06,648 --> 01:21:10,345
Jai, what are you doing?
- Take her away.

994
01:21:10,971 --> 01:21:14,679
No! No! No!

995
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:16,220
Chandu!

996
01:21:41,552 --> 01:21:43,679
Let's go.
- Leave me.

997
01:21:56,595 --> 01:22:01,262
Player. You're a big player.
What a game you played!

998
01:22:01,887 --> 01:22:03,620
Till yesterday you were my debtor.

999
01:22:04,082 --> 01:22:06,971
Today I'm your debtor. Rudra.

1000
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:13,285
Only this much?
- This is just the advance.

1001
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,525
You'll get the remaining
after the good is sold.

1002
01:22:15,826 --> 01:22:16,387
Thank you.

1003
01:22:17,637 --> 01:22:19,012
Let me tell you one thing.
- Yes.

1004
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:24,189
This one is a hot babe.
I'll have fun with her.

1005
01:22:25,262 --> 01:22:27,220
Baburao, it shouldn't be
that the girl escapes..

1006
01:22:27,303 --> 01:22:29,025
..from your grip.. otherwise I'll..

1007
01:22:30,452 --> 01:22:33,998
It might be easy to snatch meat
from crocodile's mouth.

1008
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:37,345
But the one whom Baburao catches..

1009
01:22:38,341 --> 01:22:42,220
..no one has ever been
able to free her.

1010
01:22:43,303 --> 01:22:45,759
I was just..
- Rudra, let's go.

1011
01:22:58,345 --> 01:23:05,595
Dream girl.. dream girl..
dream girl..

1012
01:23:06,966 --> 01:23:08,554
Dream girl..

1013
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:31,650
Yes, this is the right place.
Come on, get out.

1014
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:34,979
Don't waste time.
Time is money. Come.

1015
01:23:36,313 --> 01:23:38,637
Take this. My play of 2000 rupees.

1016
01:23:38,814 --> 01:23:40,936
What's the matter?
Today, you're playing big.

1017
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:43,827
If you want to play,
then play otherwise leave.

1018
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:47,025
Fine. 2000 for me.

1019
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:50,147
Greetings. Greetings, sir.

1020
01:23:50,231 --> 01:23:52,785
Hey, why did it take
you so much time?

1021
01:23:52,939 --> 01:23:55,951
Sir, it takes time to
bring a hot babe.

1022
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:59,054
Hey, uncover your veil. Come on.

1023
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:02,765
Show your beauty to sir.
No need to be so simple.

1024
01:24:03,147 --> 01:24:04,939
Take a look, sir. What a hot
babe I've got for you!

1025
01:24:05,022 --> 01:24:08,093
Yes, you're right. Take this.

1026
01:24:10,313 --> 01:24:15,147
Thanks, sir. But I didn't know
that you're such a big dealer.

1027
01:24:15,313 --> 01:24:18,021
I used to sell ordinary
girls to Baburao.

1028
01:24:18,189 --> 01:24:20,380
You've sold him a beauty.

1029
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:24,707
I took advantage of two lovers'
quarrel. And I earned money.

1030
01:24:25,147 --> 01:24:26,313
In my family everybody says that..

1031
01:24:26,396 --> 01:24:30,316
..they've not seen a
worst rascal than me.

1032
01:24:30,396 --> 01:24:33,891
But I think that I've not seen
a worst rascal than you.

1033
01:24:35,288 --> 01:24:36,244
What did you say?

1034
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:40,400
Don't feel bad, sir. Nowadays
only rascals are at the top.

1035
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,383
Good people can't achieve anything.

1036
01:24:43,888 --> 01:24:44,675
Eat..

1037
01:24:49,689 --> 01:24:53,619
'Chandu, nobody has
loved me so much.'

1038
01:24:54,308 --> 01:24:56,905
'Even mummy daddy forgot that
today is my birthday.'

1039
01:24:57,701 --> 01:24:59,983
'But you didn't forget.'

1040
01:25:01,147 --> 01:25:02,938
'Always love me like this.'

1041
01:25:03,563 --> 01:25:04,772
'Always love me like this.'

1042
01:25:06,064 --> 01:25:11,027
'Never part with me, Chandu.
I won't be able to live without you.'

1043
01:25:11,396 --> 01:25:13,064
'I won't be able to live.'

1044
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:18,852
'I'll go. I'll go to my Pooja'.

1045
01:25:31,777 --> 01:25:33,978
Catch him! Catch the rascal!

1046
01:25:36,515 --> 01:25:39,105
Put him in the car!

1047
01:26:12,791 --> 01:26:14,432
You were walking with
an air of swagger.

1048
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:17,399
Today you've come under the
grip of law and order.

1049
01:26:18,231 --> 01:26:20,216
You thought that you're a big hero.

1050
01:26:20,605 --> 01:26:23,073
You could abduct any
girl from her house.

1051
01:26:23,939 --> 01:26:29,100
And get her married. Does your
father rules this country?

1052
01:26:30,595 --> 01:26:34,269
Today I'll break your bones.

1053
01:26:35,147 --> 01:26:39,051
Tell me the truth.
Where is the girl? - Who?

1054
01:26:39,605 --> 01:26:43,358
Stop this drama.
And tell me where is Pooja?

1055
01:26:43,438 --> 01:26:45,233
Pooja? What happened to Pooja?

1056
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:46,647
What happened to Pooja?

1057
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:48,051
Don't do drama.

1058
01:26:48,881 --> 01:26:50,680
Pooja has been missing since
yesterday morning.

1059
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:53,329
Tell me the truth.
Where have you hid my daughter?

1060
01:26:53,772 --> 01:26:56,414
What are you all saying?
I can't understand.

1061
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:57,909
What has happened to Pooja?

1062
01:26:58,162 --> 01:26:59,721
He won't speak up like this!

1063
01:27:02,419 --> 01:27:06,902
Look, I don't know anything.
I don't know anything.

1064
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:11,313
Beat him hardly.

1065
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,647
Beat him and he'll remember
everything.

1066
01:28:19,555 --> 01:28:20,411
Stop!

1067
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,018
Hey, dog. Stop!

1068
01:28:34,426 --> 01:28:36,474
Give the keys otherwise
I'll fire the bullet!

1069
01:28:42,231 --> 01:28:43,313
Oh, shit!

1070
01:28:44,006 --> 01:28:45,480
Go and get the key from
there, Bhawandar.

1071
01:28:45,563 --> 01:28:47,650
Why should I get it?
I've taken a bath.

1072
01:28:47,730 --> 01:28:50,105
You bath only once in a week.
You go and get it.

1073
01:28:50,189 --> 01:28:51,731
At least under this excuse
you'll take a bath.

1074
01:28:52,064 --> 01:28:53,980
Bhawandar Singh, go and get the key.

1075
01:28:54,064 --> 01:28:56,851
Why should I get it?
- Why? I'm DIG's brother-in-law.

1076
01:28:56,931 --> 01:28:58,105
Shit!

1077
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:20,307
He is into shit now.

1078
01:29:28,147 --> 01:29:30,064
What happened, Subhedar-ji?

1079
01:29:31,022 --> 01:29:34,212
Now you've disgraced yourself.

1080
01:29:34,438 --> 01:29:37,802
I didn't know that you'll
fell in dung.

1081
01:29:38,189 --> 01:29:40,313
Listen to me and leave this case.

1082
01:29:40,563 --> 01:29:43,075
Otherwise next time you'll
fall in gutter.

1083
01:29:43,522 --> 01:29:45,137
Shall I say something,
Bhawandar Singh? - Yes.

1084
01:29:45,457 --> 01:29:46,721
Go to hell!

1085
01:30:04,398 --> 01:30:09,206
"My beloved will come..
he will take me to Dubai."

1086
01:30:14,155 --> 01:30:16,231
O my God! You're afraid of me?

1087
01:30:16,563 --> 01:30:21,702
Why are you afraid of me?
I'm that. Eat this.

1088
01:30:31,347 --> 01:30:36,488
Open the door! Open the
door! Open the door!

1089
01:30:59,056 --> 01:31:03,064
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll not spare you! - Leave me!

1090
01:31:03,605 --> 01:31:05,605
Hey! Leave him!

1091
01:31:08,605 --> 01:31:13,024
Stop fluttering around!
Otherwise I'll cut you wings!

1092
01:31:24,064 --> 01:31:27,472
Take this! Hit her and teach her
the tradition of this place!

1093
01:31:39,355 --> 01:31:42,313
Stop! If you hit delicate
body so much..

1094
01:31:42,589 --> 01:31:43,909
..then it will leave behind marks!

1095
01:31:44,231 --> 01:31:47,909
Then who will buy her.
Her price will reduce.

1096
01:31:49,064 --> 01:31:50,313
Stop her food and water.

1097
01:31:51,158 --> 01:31:54,517
Only then will she understand
and speak our language.

1098
01:32:06,522 --> 01:32:08,890
I want to go to Chandu.

1099
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:12,167
I want to go home.

1100
01:32:13,076 --> 01:32:15,174
I want to go home.

1101
01:32:32,846 --> 01:32:33,770
Hello.

1102
01:32:34,038 --> 01:32:34,765
Dad.

1103
01:32:35,096 --> 01:32:36,684
Chandu, where are you?

1104
01:32:38,346 --> 01:32:39,513
I was wandering here and there..

1105
01:32:39,849 --> 01:32:41,406
..the whole night searching for you.

1106
01:32:42,874 --> 01:32:44,016
Are you fine?

1107
01:32:44,197 --> 01:32:47,468
I'm fine wherever I am.
But Pooja is missing.

1108
01:32:47,697 --> 01:32:51,238
And inspector Mathur and Pooja's
dad are accusing me.

1109
01:32:51,364 --> 01:32:52,998
Son, I know that you're innocent.

1110
01:32:53,364 --> 01:32:55,072
Surrender yourself to the police.

1111
01:32:55,655 --> 01:32:57,242
I'll prove that you're innocent.

1112
01:32:57,322 --> 01:32:59,575
It is not important to prove
my innocence, dad.

1113
01:32:59,655 --> 01:33:01,323
What is important is to find Pooja.

1114
01:33:01,744 --> 01:33:03,034
Give me your blessings.

1115
01:33:03,530 --> 01:33:05,739
So that I can safely bring
your to-be daughter-in-law.

1116
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:13,152
Son, my blessings are always
with you. May God bless you!

1117
01:33:14,298 --> 01:33:15,930
I love you, dad.

1118
01:33:16,729 --> 01:33:18,083
I love you too, son.

1119
01:34:01,489 --> 01:34:03,978
Pooja, where are you?

1120
01:34:05,327 --> 01:34:06,719
Where are you?

1121
01:34:09,114 --> 01:34:10,048
Leave me.
- Come!

1122
01:34:10,128 --> 01:34:12,494
Leave me! Leave me!

1123
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:14,431
Pooja.

1124
01:34:14,618 --> 01:34:16,367
Leave me!
- Come.

1125
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:17,637
Pooja!

1126
01:34:17,717 --> 01:34:18,769
Leave me!

1127
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:22,780
Leave me!

1128
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:35,820
Thanks, thanks.

1129
01:34:46,751 --> 01:34:47,280
'Pooja.'

1130
01:34:57,697 --> 01:35:00,575
Pooja!

1131
01:35:02,121 --> 01:35:04,739
Pooja!

1132
01:35:07,614 --> 01:35:09,061
Pooja!

1133
01:35:09,572 --> 01:35:10,655
Hi!

1134
01:35:20,739 --> 01:35:22,489
What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

1135
01:35:22,989 --> 01:35:26,030
I know. You've got a gift for me.
- Yes.

1136
01:35:26,489 --> 01:35:29,443
Then give it to me. Give.
- First close your eyes.

1137
01:35:30,472 --> 01:35:32,288
Yes.
- Don't open it.

1138
01:35:35,851 --> 01:35:36,777
You!

1139
01:35:37,655 --> 01:35:39,734
Come here. I won't spare you!

1140
01:35:41,239 --> 01:35:45,520
Okay! Okay! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1141
01:35:47,197 --> 01:35:49,100
Now remove me from my face. Come on.

1142
01:36:01,349 --> 01:36:06,316
"What do you know,
how much I love you."

1143
01:36:06,396 --> 01:36:11,440
"I only wait for you."

1144
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:16,469
"This is our craziness."

1145
01:36:16,549 --> 01:36:20,987
"I don't feel relieved
till I see you."

1146
01:36:21,067 --> 01:36:27,869
"Come and embrace me."

1147
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:32,932
"What do you know,
how much I love you."

1148
01:36:33,012 --> 01:36:38,094
"I only wait for you."

1149
01:36:38,174 --> 01:36:43,086
"This is our craziness."

1150
01:36:43,166 --> 01:36:47,496
"I don't feel relieved
till I see you."

1151
01:36:47,576 --> 01:36:54,592
"Come and embrace me."

1152
01:37:03,933 --> 01:37:09,090
"Never before was..

1153
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:13,989
..my heart so mad in love."

1154
01:37:14,152 --> 01:37:19,322
"What is love, I deciphered..

1155
01:37:19,402 --> 01:37:24,429
..after I found you."

1156
01:37:24,716 --> 01:37:29,727
"I saw you, I fell in love with you,
I became yours."

1157
01:37:29,807 --> 01:37:34,424
"Beloved,
I got immersed in your dreams."

1158
01:37:34,504 --> 01:37:41,467
"Come let me kiss
you again and again."

1159
01:37:41,547 --> 01:37:46,282
"What do you know,
how much I love you."

1160
01:37:46,621 --> 01:37:51,665
"I only wait for you."

1161
01:37:51,745 --> 01:37:56,605
"This is our craziness."

1162
01:37:56,685 --> 01:38:01,141
"I don't feel relieved
till I see you."

1163
01:38:01,221 --> 01:38:08,035
"Come and embrace me."

1164
01:38:25,182 --> 01:38:30,210
"What a lovely romantic
weather it is!"

1165
01:38:30,290 --> 01:38:35,209
"The moonlight is in my embrace."

1166
01:38:35,596 --> 01:38:40,371
"What is dispersed here and there..

1167
01:38:40,451 --> 01:38:45,851
..is the light of love."

1168
01:38:45,931 --> 01:38:50,899
"The world of my
love is on your basis."

1169
01:38:50,979 --> 01:38:55,829
"Nobody gets a lover like you."

1170
01:38:55,909 --> 01:39:02,688
"I'm willing to die for you, beloved."

1171
01:39:02,768 --> 01:39:07,309
"What do you know,
how much I love you."

1172
01:39:07,389 --> 01:39:12,829
"I only wait for you."

1173
01:39:12,909 --> 01:39:17,949
"This is our craziness."

1174
01:39:18,029 --> 01:39:22,509
"I don't feel relieved
till I see you."

1175
01:39:22,589 --> 01:39:29,621
"Come and embrace me."

1176
01:40:07,823 --> 01:40:09,906
Get up! Get up!
- No!

1177
01:40:09,989 --> 01:40:13,322
Come!
- Leave me! Leave me! Leave me!

1178
01:40:13,405 --> 01:40:14,823
Where are you taking me!
- Come!

1179
01:40:14,906 --> 01:40:19,240
Leave me! Leave me!
Leave me! Leave me!

1180
01:40:19,739 --> 01:40:22,249
Come. Leave me!
- Come. Leave me!

1181
01:40:22,329 --> 01:40:26,614
Hey! Leave her! This is the
way to bring a delicate girl!

1182
01:40:28,364 --> 01:40:35,073
No, come here. Sit, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come. Come!

1183
01:41:05,739 --> 01:41:08,284
So? Are you all dazzled
by her beauty?

1184
01:41:08,364 --> 01:41:11,781
Hey, Sheikh. Say the price.

1185
01:41:14,184 --> 01:41:15,073
5 lakhs.

1186
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:19,340
10 lakhs.

1187
01:41:22,508 --> 01:41:23,405
15 lakhs.

1188
01:41:27,232 --> 01:41:29,322
No, no. This deal can't happen.

1189
01:41:29,892 --> 01:41:33,546
20 lakhs. - No. You all can't
afford to buy to this girl.

1190
01:41:33,626 --> 01:41:36,198
Why are you asking such a
high price for this girl!

1191
01:41:52,451 --> 01:41:55,478
Say, say. How much do you want
for this girl? Say, say.

1192
01:41:58,985 --> 01:42:02,725
50 lakhs.
- Done, done.

1193
01:42:04,092 --> 01:42:07,240
Now this girl is mine.
I'll marry her.

1194
01:42:07,576 --> 01:42:09,364
And I'll take her to my country.

1195
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:12,212
With 48 hours bring the payment.

1196
01:42:12,974 --> 01:42:15,198
Till then I'll arrange for
her fake passport and visa.

1197
01:42:15,752 --> 01:42:18,262
Thanks. Thanks a lot, Baburao.

1198
01:42:18,342 --> 01:42:21,575
Thanks a lot. You completed my wish.

1199
01:42:48,544 --> 01:42:52,243
What's happening with me?
What is happening?

1200
01:42:53,657 --> 01:42:57,322
These people sold me!
They made my deal!

1201
01:43:20,014 --> 01:43:22,642
Yes. Tell me.
- Where is your son Jai?

1202
01:43:22,722 --> 01:43:24,642
Actually he has not come back
home since last night.

1203
01:43:24,722 --> 01:43:27,928
Tell him to come to the police
station and meet me.

1204
01:43:28,223 --> 01:43:29,761
Otherwise the consequences
will not be good.

1205
01:43:29,972 --> 01:43:31,671
Did you understand?
- Yes, sir.

1206
01:43:43,266 --> 01:43:44,393
Tell me, where is Chandar?

1207
01:43:44,473 --> 01:43:45,805
Tell me. Tell me.

1208
01:43:46,348 --> 01:43:48,306
Tell me, you idiot! Otherwise
I will pull off your skin!

1209
01:43:48,389 --> 01:43:49,931
Tell me.
- I don't know, sir. - I don't know.

1210
01:43:50,014 --> 01:43:51,722
Hey! You tell me. Tell me.
Where is Chandar?

1211
01:43:51,805 --> 01:43:53,056
I don't know, sir. Tell me.

1212
01:43:53,139 --> 01:43:55,473
Otherwise you will be imprisoned
all your life.

1213
01:43:56,722 --> 01:43:59,469
Hey! Tell me where is Chandar?

1214
01:44:00,011 --> 01:44:03,190
I will tell you. I will tell you.
But in the side. - Let's go.

1215
01:44:03,556 --> 01:44:08,026
Tell me. Tell me.
- I will tell you in your ears. Tell me.

1216
01:44:09,431 --> 01:44:20,264
I don't know!!!!

1217
01:44:25,313 --> 01:44:27,528
Hey! What is wrong with you?

1218
01:44:27,847 --> 01:44:29,097
Yeah! What is wrong with you?

1219
01:44:29,514 --> 01:44:31,059
Why did you scream so loudly?

1220
01:44:31,139 --> 01:44:32,223
If you don't know then
you must say clearly..

1221
01:44:32,306 --> 01:44:33,573
..that you don't know.

1222
01:44:35,056 --> 01:44:37,656
From when I am telling all
of you that I don't know.

1223
01:44:38,097 --> 01:44:40,362
I don't know.
But nobody listens to me.

1224
01:44:40,569 --> 01:44:42,611
So I thought that you would be deaf.

1225
01:44:43,139 --> 01:44:45,706
That is why, I yelled loudly.
- Rascal.

1226
01:44:48,306 --> 01:44:50,410
Hit me! Hit me!

1227
01:44:51,257 --> 01:44:55,132
Today I will teach you
a very good lesson.

1228
01:44:55,431 --> 01:44:57,473
Will you teach me a lesson?
You rascal!

1229
01:45:08,097 --> 01:45:10,181
You have searched Pooja everywhere.

1230
01:45:10,389 --> 01:45:11,694
You looked out for her
in the entire city.

1231
01:45:12,327 --> 01:45:13,865
But you were unable
to find her anywhere.

1232
01:45:14,181 --> 01:45:16,831
I think that it was the
decision of her parent's.

1233
01:45:17,097 --> 01:45:21,112
Your anger on that day.
She was unable to tolerate all that.

1234
01:45:23,223 --> 01:45:26,041
Chandar, is it so that
Pooja might have..

1235
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:27,633
..committed suicide?

1236
01:45:29,383 --> 01:45:30,473
No!

1237
01:45:31,591 --> 01:45:33,188
She had promised me that
if she would survive..

1238
01:45:33,804 --> 01:45:35,329
..then it would be with me.

1239
01:45:35,972 --> 01:45:37,097
If she would die then also
it would be with me only.

1240
01:45:37,931 --> 01:45:41,753
No! No! I did not mean to say this.

1241
01:45:42,181 --> 01:45:43,725
Actually..
- She is alive.

1242
01:45:47,349 --> 01:45:49,139
My heart says so.

1243
01:45:52,306 --> 01:45:54,137
She is definitely in some problem.

1244
01:45:54,717 --> 01:45:56,518
Yes. Even I feel the same.

1245
01:45:56,598 --> 01:45:57,722
Nowadays, the number
of kidnapping cases..

1246
01:45:57,805 --> 01:45:59,016
..has increased so
much in this city.

1247
01:45:59,431 --> 01:46:00,722
It is possible that somebody
might have kidnapped her..

1248
01:46:00,805 --> 01:46:02,665
..for the greed of money.

1249
01:46:03,617 --> 01:46:05,223
You are right.
- Yes, Chandar.

1250
01:46:05,306 --> 01:46:06,722
And I know such a person
who can give us..

1251
01:46:06,805 --> 01:46:08,467
..the correct information
about all this?

1252
01:46:08,764 --> 01:46:10,543
Where will we find him?
- In Sun Light club!

1253
01:46:45,715 --> 01:46:50,854
"My cheeks are very fair.
My walk is very pretentious."

1254
01:46:54,476 --> 01:46:59,388
"Look at my thin waist.
All the lovers have gone crazy."

1255
01:47:03,245 --> 01:47:07,596
"My cheeks are very fair.
My walk is very pretentious."

1256
01:47:07,676 --> 01:47:12,269
"Look at my thin waist.
All the lovers have gone crazy."

1257
01:47:12,349 --> 01:47:16,435
"Take out your veil.
Just take out your veil."

1258
01:47:16,515 --> 01:47:20,731
"Let everyone in this
gathering enjoy themselves."

1259
01:47:20,921 --> 01:47:22,909
"Take out your veil.
Just take out your veil."

1260
01:47:22,989 --> 01:47:25,254
"Show us some magic.
Just show us some magic."

1261
01:47:25,334 --> 01:47:29,629
"My cheeks are very fair.
My walk is very pretentious."

1262
01:47:29,709 --> 01:47:34,685
"Look at my thin waist.
All the lovers have gone crazy."

1263
01:47:46,878 --> 01:47:49,056
"My veil is of velvet cloth."

1264
01:47:49,136 --> 01:47:51,315
"My sarong is properly embroidered."

1265
01:47:51,395 --> 01:47:53,549
"Nobody can value it."

1266
01:47:53,629 --> 01:47:55,789
"My beauty is very expensive."

1267
01:47:55,869 --> 01:47:57,808
"Just move your veil a little."

1268
01:47:57,888 --> 01:48:00,353
"Turn around your sarong once."

1269
01:48:00,433 --> 01:48:02,377
"We will give you
whatever you ask for."

1270
01:48:02,457 --> 01:48:04,623
"Intoxicate us through your eyes."

1271
01:48:04,703 --> 01:48:05,898
"I will give you the
earrings of my ears."

1272
01:48:05,978 --> 01:48:06,970
"I will give you the
pleasure of my luscious lips."

1273
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:08,098
"I will give you
the youth of my cheeks."

1274
01:48:08,178 --> 01:48:09,233
"I will give you all the pleasures."

1275
01:48:09,313 --> 01:48:13,398
"Take out your veil.
Just take out your veil."

1276
01:48:13,649 --> 01:48:17,884
"Let everyone in this
gathering enjoy themselves."

1277
01:48:17,964 --> 01:48:19,981
"Take out your veil.
Just take out your veil."

1278
01:48:20,061 --> 01:48:22,298
"Show us some magic.
Just show us some magic."

1279
01:48:22,378 --> 01:48:26,817
"My cheeks are very fair.
My walk is very pretentious."

1280
01:48:26,897 --> 01:48:31,594
"Look at my thin waist.
All the lovers have gone crazy."

1281
01:48:57,175 --> 01:49:01,498
"Let the sensuous desires
be controlled, my lover."

1282
01:49:01,578 --> 01:49:03,744
"I will surely show
you all the magic."

1283
01:49:03,824 --> 01:49:05,917
"Let the night be more romantic."

1284
01:49:05,997 --> 01:49:08,218
"Do not make us suffer like this."

1285
01:49:08,298 --> 01:49:10,324
"Let us take you in our arms."

1286
01:49:10,404 --> 01:49:12,657
"We will give you lots of reward."

1287
01:49:12,737 --> 01:49:14,938
"Allow us to do
whatever we want to do."

1288
01:49:15,018 --> 01:49:16,218
"I will make you suffer a little."

1289
01:49:16,298 --> 01:49:17,275
"I will torment you a little."

1290
01:49:17,355 --> 01:49:19,458
"I will decorate the bed for you.
I surely will quench your thirst."

1291
01:49:19,538 --> 01:49:23,668
"Take out your veil.
Just take out your veil."

1292
01:49:23,988 --> 01:49:28,329
"Let everyone in this
gathering enjoy themselves."

1293
01:49:28,409 --> 01:49:30,262
"Take out your veil.
Just take out your veil."

1294
01:49:30,342 --> 01:49:32,694
"Show us some magic.
Just show us some magic."

1295
01:49:32,774 --> 01:49:37,094
"My cheeks are very fair.
My walk is very pretentious."

1296
01:49:37,174 --> 01:49:42,045
"Look at my thin waist.
All the lovers have gone crazy."

1297
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:47,598
'This earring belongs to Pooja!'

1298
01:50:21,139 --> 01:50:22,223
Jai, tell me where is Pooja?

1299
01:50:23,847 --> 01:50:27,675
Jai! You are my childhood friend.
Don't do this to me!

1300
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:30,972
Tell me, where is Pooja? Please.

1301
01:50:31,972 --> 01:50:32,857
Jai!

1302
01:50:33,998 --> 01:50:36,097
Jai, listen to me.
- Chandar!

1303
01:50:38,431 --> 01:50:40,972
Hey, Chandar! Don't move!

1304
01:50:41,514 --> 01:50:42,598
Or else I will shoot you.

1305
01:50:47,010 --> 01:50:49,706
Now your escaping has
come to an end, dear.

1306
01:50:50,014 --> 01:50:51,097
Inspector, listen to me at least.

1307
01:50:51,181 --> 01:50:52,017
I am innocent.

1308
01:50:52,097 --> 01:50:55,497
Now whatever you have to say,
go up and speak to God.

1309
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:58,652
Because I am going to
kill you very soon now.

1310
01:51:01,181 --> 01:51:03,869
Dear, remember the Almighty.

1311
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:09,722
Remember the Almighty.

1312
01:51:12,193 --> 01:51:13,056
Remember the Almighty.

1313
01:51:16,972 --> 01:51:18,226
Hey! What are you doing? You rascal!

1314
01:51:18,556 --> 01:51:23,026
Hey!.. You rascal!

1315
01:51:37,097 --> 01:51:39,872
Hey, father! Father, I have got
married, father. - Yes, child.

1316
01:51:40,014 --> 01:51:41,097
And on top of that, the problem
that was supposed..

1317
01:51:41,181 --> 01:51:42,264
..to arrive even that has not
yet come. - It has not come!

1318
01:51:42,348 --> 01:51:43,864
I am very happy, father.

1319
01:51:51,669 --> 01:51:52,593
Oh god!

1320
01:51:52,673 --> 01:51:54,334
Father, what is this sound?

1321
01:51:54,414 --> 01:51:57,223
A six-feet tall man has
fallen on your wife.

1322
01:51:57,821 --> 01:51:59,722
A six-feet man has fallen
on my wife! - Yes, son.

1323
01:52:01,097 --> 01:52:03,348
Hey, brother! Why did
you fall from above?

1324
01:52:03,431 --> 01:52:04,889
Did you have to fall
on my wife only?

1325
01:52:04,972 --> 01:52:06,514
You know how much I love my wife.

1326
01:52:06,598 --> 01:52:07,931
I love my wife.

1327
01:52:09,849 --> 01:52:10,640
Excuse me. Please move aside.

1328
01:52:11,069 --> 01:52:12,306
Pandit-ji, where is my wife?
- It is she only.

1329
01:52:12,389 --> 01:52:14,931
It's me.
- Don't joke with me. Go away.

1330
01:52:15,014 --> 01:52:16,097
Where is my wife?
- She is your wife.

1331
01:52:16,181 --> 01:52:17,264
I am only your wife.

1332
01:52:27,362 --> 01:52:30,851
Inspector, you have made my
tall wife so short now.

1333
01:52:30,931 --> 01:52:32,747
Come on. Make her tall once again.
- How should I?

1334
01:52:32,827 --> 01:52:34,096
In the same way, as you
had made her short.

1335
01:52:34,176 --> 01:52:34,972
Make her tall now. I cannot do it!

1336
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:38,369
Don't touch a policeman! Or
else I will imprison you.

1337
01:52:39,348 --> 01:52:41,082
He is threatening me of a policeman!

1338
01:52:41,649 --> 01:52:43,649
He has ruined me!

1339
01:52:44,139 --> 01:52:45,722
But I will not spare you.

1340
01:52:45,802 --> 01:52:48,223
As Reena Roy had made a
note of all the heroes..

1341
01:52:48,306 --> 01:52:50,223
..in the film 'Nagin',
in the same way..

1342
01:52:50,306 --> 01:52:52,312
..even I have made a note of you.

1343
01:52:52,471 --> 01:52:54,263
I will not spare you.

1344
01:52:54,478 --> 01:52:56,431
My dear husband. Come on.

1345
01:52:56,796 --> 01:52:58,056
Lets go and celebrate our honeymoon.

1346
01:52:58,348 --> 01:53:00,348
Do you want to celebrate
a honeymoon? - Yes.

1347
01:53:00,431 --> 01:53:02,514
Look at your size. You
have become so short.

1348
01:53:02,598 --> 01:53:04,125
And the kids that you will give
birth to will be so tiny.

1349
01:53:04,205 --> 01:53:05,405
They will run around
in the entire area.

1350
01:53:05,485 --> 01:53:06,306
They will hide inside the holes.

1351
01:53:06,389 --> 01:53:07,431
Who will search for them?

1352
01:53:07,514 --> 01:53:08,889
Your father or my father!

1353
01:53:09,534 --> 01:53:10,223
Come on. Lets go.

1354
01:53:10,306 --> 01:53:11,389
Where do I come with you?

1355
01:53:11,473 --> 01:53:12,556
This is not done.
It's just not done.

1356
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:13,722
Somebody please explain to her.

1357
01:53:13,805 --> 01:53:16,473
Hey, Pandit! Say such prayers
that she will become tall now.

1358
01:53:16,556 --> 01:53:17,805
It is not possible.
- It is not possible.

1359
01:53:17,889 --> 01:53:19,306
Then go away from here. Get lost!

1360
01:53:19,389 --> 01:53:20,805
My dear husband! My dear husband!

1361
01:53:28,406 --> 01:53:28,931
Don't cry!

1362
01:53:34,325 --> 01:53:38,279
When daughter Pooja was with us..

1363
01:53:39,655 --> 01:53:42,306
..then we never realized
her importance.

1364
01:53:43,348 --> 01:53:44,931
Maybe.. Maybe that is why,
God has given us..

1365
01:53:45,014 --> 01:53:46,722
..this punishment.

1366
01:53:47,378 --> 01:53:49,722
He has vanished our daughter Pooja.

1367
01:53:50,595 --> 01:53:54,075
Oh my God! Please protect our child!

1368
01:53:54,885 --> 01:53:57,141
Please protect our child!

1369
01:53:59,348 --> 01:54:01,793
I never even thought that
my childhood friend..

1370
01:54:01,980 --> 01:54:04,473
..my childhood buddy would
betray me this way.

1371
01:54:05,278 --> 01:54:09,348
I don't know that where
has he hidden my Pooja?

1372
01:54:09,805 --> 01:54:11,514
But in order to search Pooja,
it is necessary for us..

1373
01:54:11,598 --> 01:54:12,722
..to search that Jai first.

1374
01:54:13,223 --> 01:54:16,598
Let that rascal be anywhere!
I will surely search him.

1375
01:54:17,014 --> 01:54:19,056
Why, Gadru? What information
have you brought?

1376
01:54:19,139 --> 01:54:20,931
Sir, the information is
this that my neighbour..

1377
01:54:21,014 --> 01:54:22,962
..is going to run away tonight.

1378
01:54:23,139 --> 01:54:24,556
Is that girl a minor or an adult?

1379
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,660
She is an adult, sir.

1380
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:26,719
So then what is the complaint?

1381
01:54:26,799 --> 01:54:28,348
The complaint is this that earlier..

1382
01:54:28,431 --> 01:54:30,014
..she was supposed to
run away with me.

1383
01:54:30,097 --> 01:54:32,014
Today she is running away
with someone else.

1384
01:54:32,097 --> 01:54:33,473
Hey, you drunkard! How
will you manage..

1385
01:54:33,556 --> 01:54:34,722
..to run away with a girl?

1386
01:54:34,889 --> 01:54:38,598
You will die on the way back now.
- Sir! Sir!

1387
01:54:38,895 --> 01:54:41,556
Sir. Please save me, sir.

1388
01:54:41,805 --> 01:54:44,139
You are Chandar's friend, isn't it?

1389
01:54:44,327 --> 01:54:45,598
I am not. But I was.

1390
01:54:45,889 --> 01:54:48,624
I had only given you that
information yesterday.

1391
01:54:48,852 --> 01:54:49,678
Oh, I see.

1392
01:54:49,758 --> 01:54:51,389
And he knows about it now.

1393
01:54:51,754 --> 01:54:53,139
That is why, he is after me now.

1394
01:54:54,014 --> 01:54:57,931
So you want protection, isn't it?
- Yes.

1395
01:54:58,307 --> 01:55:00,624
Protection as well as
Chandar's arrest!

1396
01:55:00,889 --> 01:55:03,410
Sir, I am that prey with whose
help you can get hold of him.

1397
01:55:03,490 --> 01:55:04,722
Just a minute! Just a minute!
Just a minute!

1398
01:55:05,236 --> 01:55:06,598
Subhedar-ji!
- Yes.

1399
01:55:06,722 --> 01:55:08,348
Sir, it should not happen
that in the process..

1400
01:55:08,431 --> 01:55:09,722
..of getting hold of him
through his help..

1401
01:55:09,805 --> 01:55:11,473
..a middleman might fall in danger.

1402
01:55:11,556 --> 01:55:12,905
What do you mean?
- I mean you.

1403
01:55:14,306 --> 01:55:16,473
Out! Get out! - It's fine with
me if you want me to get out.

1404
01:55:16,556 --> 01:55:18,163
Anyway, I wanted to drink
tea from a very long time.

1405
01:55:18,243 --> 01:55:19,473
Who will stand here
and waste his time?

1406
01:55:19,556 --> 01:55:23,431
Look Jai, now I will
make such a plan..

1407
01:55:23,841 --> 01:55:25,389
..that he will not at
all be able to escape.

1408
01:55:26,056 --> 01:55:27,729
Why, Gadru? You understood that
what you have to do. Isn't it?

1409
01:55:27,809 --> 01:55:29,556
I have understood it, sir.
I have understood it.

1410
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:31,139
His game is over.

1411
01:55:31,972 --> 01:55:33,223
But we will definitely have
to think of some way..

1412
01:55:33,306 --> 01:55:34,483
..in order to find Jai, isn't it?

1413
01:55:34,563 --> 01:55:37,722
Sir! I can show you the way.

1414
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:40,348
Because the place where
he is hiding..

1415
01:55:40,697 --> 01:55:43,537
..I know that path that
lane and that house too.

1416
01:55:43,617 --> 01:55:44,316
Who are you?

1417
01:55:44,475 --> 01:55:46,139
My name is Gadru Khabri.

1418
01:55:46,223 --> 01:55:48,514
If I will get 1000 rupees then
I will inform the lion..

1419
01:55:48,598 --> 01:55:50,556
..about the whereabouts of his prey.

1420
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:51,889
And if the information
will be wrong then?

1421
01:55:51,972 --> 01:55:53,948
Then you can kill me anytime.

1422
01:55:54,086 --> 01:55:56,009
Immediately give me some money.

1423
01:56:01,123 --> 01:56:01,931
Yes!

1424
01:56:24,435 --> 01:56:25,598
You rascal. I will..

1425
01:56:33,606 --> 01:56:35,176
You were searching your
friend, isn't it?

1426
01:56:35,492 --> 01:56:37,348
Don't worry! Jai is
absolutely safe..

1427
01:56:37,431 --> 01:56:40,170
..in my secret informer
Gadru's house.

1428
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:44,348
But right now, you are
very unsafe, my dear.

1429
01:56:45,587 --> 01:56:47,805
Just look around and
see. Look around.

1430
01:56:56,348 --> 01:56:59,348
I had told you that one day
you would definitely..

1431
01:56:59,431 --> 01:57:00,722
..come under my control.

1432
01:57:01,139 --> 01:57:03,107
So then today, I will
not only hit you.

1433
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:05,640
But I will hit you until you die.

1434
01:57:05,722 --> 01:57:06,805
You rascal!

1435
01:57:12,968 --> 01:57:13,805
You!

1436
01:57:14,929 --> 01:57:18,056
Why, inspector sir? You are
completely shocked, isn't it?

1437
01:57:18,657 --> 01:57:20,598
Don't be surprised! I
will explain it to you.

1438
01:57:20,822 --> 01:57:24,632
Look. Two kilos of cotton.
And this 2 inches heel.

1439
01:57:24,712 --> 01:57:28,139
And this tape recorder
has fooled you.

1440
01:57:28,376 --> 01:57:30,889
This is known as tit for tat.

1441
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:34,630
You rascal! You have known about
Jai's whereabouts from me.

1442
01:57:34,845 --> 01:57:36,931
But before you can convey this
information to Chandar..

1443
01:57:37,014 --> 01:57:38,722
..I will ruin you completely.

1444
01:57:38,802 --> 01:57:40,306
Just a minute! Just a minute!

1445
01:57:40,473 --> 01:57:42,514
Chandar already has
this information.

1446
01:57:42,598 --> 01:57:44,212
Who has conveyed this information?
- You have.

1447
01:57:44,292 --> 01:57:45,514
Me?
- Yes!

1448
01:57:45,594 --> 01:57:49,640
You just said that Jai is
safe at Gadru's house.

1449
01:57:50,139 --> 01:57:54,306
And Chandar has heard it
through the mobile phone.

1450
01:57:54,766 --> 01:57:55,473
It is switched on.

1451
01:57:55,712 --> 01:57:57,805
At least say hello to Chandar.

1452
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,598
Subhedar-ji, I had thought that
this guy is just threatening you.

1453
01:58:02,722 --> 01:58:05,056
But he has indeed taught
you a lesson today.

1454
01:58:05,348 --> 01:58:06,889
Now tell us what will happen ahead?

1455
01:58:06,969 --> 01:58:08,722
I will tell you. I will tell you.
- Yes.

1456
01:58:08,931 --> 01:58:10,654
I have taught one lesson to your..

1457
01:58:10,734 --> 01:58:12,516
Subhedar-ji!
- Yes.

1458
01:58:12,596 --> 01:58:14,931
And the second..
- Lesson. Lesson.

1459
01:58:15,169 --> 01:58:18,539
Yeah! Chandar will teach it to Jai.

1460
01:58:18,931 --> 01:58:20,056
Jai!

1461
01:58:25,334 --> 01:58:26,223
Jai!

1462
01:58:46,345 --> 01:58:47,223
Jai!

1463
01:58:53,929 --> 01:58:55,722
Tell me. Tell me. Tell
me where is Pooja?

1464
01:58:55,805 --> 01:58:56,889
Tell me.

1465
01:59:06,417 --> 01:59:07,348
No, Chandar!

1466
01:59:23,514 --> 01:59:25,640
Tell me. Tell me where is my Pooja?

1467
01:59:26,151 --> 01:59:29,223
Otherwise I will kill you.
Tell me. Tell me. - I will..

1468
01:59:29,306 --> 01:59:30,473
I will tell you.

1469
01:59:30,805 --> 01:59:35,181
I have sold your Pooja to
the prostitute's market.

1470
02:00:06,281 --> 02:00:08,240
Let go of me! Let go of me!

1471
02:00:08,323 --> 02:00:11,572
Let go of me!
- Come on. Come on.

1472
02:00:11,656 --> 02:00:13,114
Let go of me!

1473
02:00:24,493 --> 02:00:25,781
Who have you brought over here?

1474
02:00:27,575 --> 02:00:31,073
Who is he?
- He has.. He has come here for Pooja.

1475
02:00:31,345 --> 02:00:34,115
He has hit me a lot.
Do not spare him!

1476
02:00:34,476 --> 02:00:37,906
Baburao, hand over my Pooja to me.

1477
02:00:37,986 --> 02:00:42,073
Hey! Let it be Pooja
or anybody else.

1478
02:00:43,582 --> 02:00:47,365
Those girls who come here once,
they never return back.

1479
02:00:48,489 --> 02:00:49,262
Did you understand?

1480
02:00:51,073 --> 02:00:51,788
Come on. Leave now.

1481
02:00:52,781 --> 02:00:53,864
Hey, leave!

1482
02:00:57,610 --> 02:01:00,489
Hey, Baburao! Let go of my Pooja!

1483
02:01:01,059 --> 02:01:02,470
Let go of my Pooja!

1484
02:01:02,550 --> 02:01:06,906
Pooja! Pooja!

1485
02:01:07,824 --> 02:01:10,198
Pooja!
- Chandar!

1486
02:01:10,281 --> 02:01:11,750
Pooja! Pooja!
- Chandu!

1487
02:01:11,940 --> 02:01:15,823
Chandu! Chandu!

1488
02:01:17,572 --> 02:01:20,489
Chandu!
- Pooja!

1489
02:01:20,572 --> 02:01:22,407
Let go of me. Let go of me.

1490
02:01:22,489 --> 02:01:24,823
Take her away! Take her away!

1491
02:01:25,008 --> 02:01:28,596
No! Pooja!
- Let go of me.

1492
02:01:28,676 --> 02:01:31,365
Pooja!
- Let go of me.

1493
02:01:31,489 --> 02:01:37,489
Chandu! Chandu!
- Pooja! Pooja!

1494
02:01:38,037 --> 02:01:39,489
Pooja!

1495
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:42,279
No! Chandu!

1496
02:02:10,828 --> 02:02:11,873
Catch him.

1497
02:02:12,094 --> 02:02:12,918
Get up.

1498
02:03:26,350 --> 02:03:27,505
Come on. Run away from here!

1499
02:03:57,962 --> 02:04:00,003
Chandar! Chandar!

1500
02:04:01,070 --> 02:04:02,170
Chandar! Chandar!
- Pooja!

1501
02:04:02,254 --> 02:04:03,336
Chandar! Chandar! Chandar!

1502
02:04:03,419 --> 02:04:05,837
What happened to you?
- Pooja! My Pooja!

1503
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:07,003
Chandar! Chandar!

1504
02:04:07,087 --> 02:04:08,418
Control yourself, Chandar!

1505
02:04:08,613 --> 02:04:09,837
Pooja!
- Chandar! Chandar!

1506
02:04:11,921 --> 02:04:12,898
Chandar!

1507
02:04:14,148 --> 02:04:15,208
Is anybody here?

1508
02:04:28,837 --> 02:04:30,003
Dear Chandar!
- Chandar!

1509
02:04:43,196 --> 02:04:44,753
Dear Chandar, what is all this?

1510
02:04:44,837 --> 02:04:46,321
How did all this happen? Chandar!

1511
02:04:52,336 --> 02:04:54,123
Chandar! Dear Chandar!

1512
02:04:56,526 --> 02:04:57,488
Chandar!

1513
02:05:51,690 --> 02:06:02,444
"Lover! You have made me a lover!"

1514
02:06:02,962 --> 02:06:13,832
"Lover! You have made me a lover!"

1515
02:06:14,324 --> 02:06:16,962
"My heart is with you."

1516
02:06:17,042 --> 02:06:20,307
"Your heart is with me."

1517
02:06:20,387 --> 02:06:25,722
"What is this strange thing?"

1518
02:06:25,802 --> 02:06:30,386
"My darling, this is only love."

1519
02:06:31,869 --> 02:06:36,607
"My darling, this is only love."

1520
02:06:38,274 --> 02:06:40,042
Chandar! Chandar! Chandar!
- What is happening to you, son?

1521
02:07:03,387 --> 02:07:09,105
"Never give me the poison
of separation, my sweetheart."

1522
02:07:09,185 --> 02:07:11,761
"Now I neither want
to die without you."

1523
02:07:11,841 --> 02:07:14,816
"Nor do I want to
survive without you."

1524
02:07:17,642 --> 02:07:28,613
"Survive! I don't want
to survive alone now."

1525
02:07:28,693 --> 02:07:31,324
"On the pleasant paths of love."

1526
02:07:31,404 --> 02:07:34,840
"In the pleasant and joyful shelter."

1527
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:40,288
"There is the wall of this world."

1528
02:07:40,368 --> 02:07:45,564
"My darling, this is only love."

1529
02:07:45,644 --> 02:07:56,753
"Lover! You have made me a lover!"

1530
02:07:56,833 --> 02:07:59,513
"My heart is with you."

1531
02:07:59,593 --> 02:08:02,669
"Your heart is with me."

1532
02:08:02,961 --> 02:08:08,212
"What is this strange thing?"

1533
02:08:08,292 --> 02:08:12,202
"My darling, this is only love."

1534
02:08:14,128 --> 02:08:19,162
"My darling, this is only love"

1535
02:08:41,962 --> 02:08:44,545
Pooja! They have taken away my Pooja!
- Hold on.

1536
02:08:44,628 --> 02:08:46,087
Hold on, Chandar!
- No!

1537
02:08:46,170 --> 02:08:49,419
Pooja! Pooja!
- Dear Chandar. My Chandar!

1538
02:08:49,503 --> 02:08:52,837
Chandar relax.
- No, Chandar! No!

1539
02:08:59,545 --> 02:09:04,692
Sir, yours.. Your sister's..

1540
02:09:04,772 --> 02:09:07,913
Your sister's.. Your sister's..

1541
02:09:07,993 --> 02:09:10,837
Why are you after his sister?

1542
02:09:11,170 --> 02:09:12,503
Is his sister going to
give birth to a child?

1543
02:09:12,586 --> 02:09:13,670
What is this rubbish?

1544
02:09:13,753 --> 02:09:15,141
He is not saying anything
ahead of that. - Shut up!

1545
02:09:15,221 --> 02:09:17,753
Go ahead.
- Tell me what were you saying?

1546
02:09:17,833 --> 02:09:21,336
That Chandar is hiding
at your sister's house.

1547
02:09:21,419 --> 02:09:23,503
You go immediately and
get hold of him.

1548
02:09:23,586 --> 02:09:25,087
Well done, Gadru! Well done!

1549
02:09:27,087 --> 02:09:29,128
Now I will not spare him.

1550
02:09:30,336 --> 02:09:32,087
Bhawandar Singh, come with me!
- Lets go.

1551
02:09:33,087 --> 02:09:33,947
Subhedar-ji!
- Yes.

1552
02:09:34,027 --> 02:09:35,628
Are you intending to walk
up till there? - Why?

1553
02:09:35,711 --> 02:09:36,795
Because the keys to the jeep
are left inside only.

1554
02:09:36,875 --> 02:09:37,396
Then go and bring it.

1555
02:09:37,476 --> 02:09:38,517
So you should have told me earlier.
You did not tell me.

1556
02:09:38,597 --> 02:09:39,520
So go and bring it now.

1557
02:09:39,983 --> 02:09:40,840
Sir.
- Yes.

1558
02:09:40,979 --> 02:09:43,986
My commission.
- Yes. Take this.

1559
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:46,795
Bhawandar Singh, hurry up!
- Here I am.

1560
02:09:46,878 --> 02:09:48,879
So then why were you taking so long?
- I was solving your problem.

1561
02:09:48,959 --> 02:09:49,906
So come on. Lets go now.
- Yes. Let's go.

1562
02:09:50,994 --> 02:09:53,003
Wait! You go from here.

1563
02:09:53,087 --> 02:09:54,628
You go from here.
- Bhawandar Singh!

1564
02:10:10,087 --> 02:10:11,419
You rascal! Are you showing
me the bananas?

1565
02:10:11,503 --> 02:10:12,447
Tell me, where is Chandar?

1566
02:10:12,527 --> 02:10:14,795
I had received a call from
the police station only.

1567
02:10:14,948 --> 02:10:16,336
Asking Chandar to
run away from here.

1568
02:10:16,595 --> 02:10:17,503
So he ran away from here.

1569
02:10:17,586 --> 02:10:20,419
Who had called up?
- I had called up, sir.

1570
02:10:20,837 --> 02:10:23,116
Why? - Because Subhedar-ji,
whenever you have..

1571
02:10:23,483 --> 02:10:27,503
..come across that boy, you
have always lost to him.

1572
02:10:27,586 --> 02:10:29,393
So I don't like it.

1573
02:10:29,473 --> 02:10:32,628
Hey, Bhawandar Singh!
You have helped a criminal.

1574
02:10:33,212 --> 02:10:37,336
No! Subhedar-ji, no! I have
not supported a criminal.

1575
02:10:38,031 --> 02:10:40,545
I have supported an innocent man.

1576
02:10:41,336 --> 02:10:45,586
You must not speak only
about law, Subhedar-ji!

1577
02:10:46,049 --> 02:10:48,087
In front of me, you
have accepted bribe..

1578
02:10:48,170 --> 02:10:50,153
..and let the robbers,
murderers and goons go.

1579
02:10:50,233 --> 02:10:51,962
I have seen it myself.

1580
02:10:52,670 --> 02:10:54,336
Under the cover of law,
you are just taking..

1581
02:10:54,419 --> 02:10:56,045
..your personal revenge.

1582
02:10:56,220 --> 02:11:01,212
Bhawandar Singh! If I want then
I can suspend you right now.

1583
02:11:01,336 --> 02:11:03,753
How will you suspend me?

1584
02:11:04,032 --> 02:11:06,336
Hey! I have made you an
inspector by referring..

1585
02:11:06,419 --> 02:11:08,503
..your name to my brother-in-law
again and again.

1586
02:11:08,962 --> 02:11:11,336
What is the value of
a constable's post?

1587
02:11:11,574 --> 02:11:15,336
Under your cover, I will not accept
the post of an ACP also.

1588
02:11:15,503 --> 02:11:17,419
I will sit on the footpath
with a stall.

1589
02:11:17,837 --> 02:11:19,545
And I will sell the bananas.

1590
02:11:19,962 --> 02:11:21,503
But I will not be a slave to you.

1591
02:11:21,753 --> 02:11:23,995
Hold this stick! And goodbye!

1592
02:11:24,075 --> 02:11:26,087
Bhawandar Singh!
Bhawandar Singh! Listen to me.

1593
02:11:26,170 --> 02:11:27,254
Bhawandar Singh!

1594
02:11:28,886 --> 02:11:29,503
Come.

1595
02:11:36,419 --> 02:11:37,503
Where did Chandar go?

1596
02:11:40,184 --> 02:11:43,503
Hello Rudra! Ask Sheikh to bring
the money and come there.

1597
02:11:44,503 --> 02:11:45,670
Yes. To the same place.

1598
02:11:46,184 --> 02:11:47,837
The passport and the
money are ready.

1599
02:11:48,212 --> 02:11:49,837
I am coming in a short while
along with that girl.

1600
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:50,805
All right!

1601
02:11:51,359 --> 02:11:53,787
Vaishali! Hey Vaishali!

1602
02:11:55,116 --> 02:11:55,773
Yes.

1603
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:59,854
Take this. Ask that girl to
wear a veil and come.

1604
02:12:01,091 --> 02:12:01,618
Yes.

1605
02:12:15,660 --> 02:12:17,034
Hey! Bring her here!

1606
02:12:17,114 --> 02:12:18,807
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1607
02:12:22,212 --> 02:12:23,503
Are you acting too smart?

1608
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:24,591
Sit inside the car.

1609
02:12:31,753 --> 02:12:33,419
A jeweller recognizes
his diamond very well.

1610
02:12:34,056 --> 02:12:35,283
And I recognise my girls very well.

1611
02:12:38,346 --> 02:12:40,212
Who has how much blood in her veins?

1612
02:12:40,503 --> 02:12:42,419
I know it very well.

1613
02:12:44,087 --> 02:12:46,128
There is only one way of saving
yourself from Baburao.

1614
02:12:46,981 --> 02:12:48,336
The way of death!

1615
02:12:49,078 --> 02:12:50,609
Pooja, run away!

1616
02:12:52,477 --> 02:12:53,942
Pooja, run away!

1617
02:12:54,545 --> 02:12:58,920
You rascal! I will not let you
ruin another girl's life.

1618
02:12:59,319 --> 02:13:00,920
Pooja, run away!

1619
02:13:01,818 --> 02:13:03,336
Pooja, run away!

1620
02:13:13,336 --> 02:13:14,753
Vaishali!

1621
02:13:24,006 --> 02:13:25,419
Chandar!

1622
02:13:32,293 --> 02:13:33,882
Pooja!
- What happened to Pooja?

1623
02:13:34,251 --> 02:13:37,082
They have taken away Pooja.
- Where?

1624
02:13:38,843 --> 02:13:41,675
Rudra, Samira Manzil.

1625
02:13:42,118 --> 02:13:43,470
Save her.

1626
02:13:50,660 --> 02:13:54,411
Take this passport.
Now she is Shareefa Begum.

1627
02:13:55,244 --> 02:13:57,827
Take her away! And enjoy yourself!

1628
02:13:57,910 --> 02:14:00,161
Thank you, Baburao.
Thank you very much.

1629
02:14:00,244 --> 02:14:01,952
Sheikh sir, your work is done.

1630
02:14:02,119 --> 02:14:03,382
What about our payment?

1631
02:14:03,462 --> 02:14:05,023
Your payment! Here, it is.

1632
02:14:05,103 --> 02:14:08,065
Count it. It is complete 50 lakhs.

1633
02:14:08,703 --> 02:14:09,827
Now the payment is done.

1634
02:14:10,004 --> 02:14:13,104
Where is my sweetheart?
- Rudra!

1635
02:14:13,743 --> 02:14:16,286
Hey! Bring the girl over here.
- Let go of me.

1636
02:14:16,743 --> 02:14:18,910
I will not go anywhere.
I will not go anywhere.

1637
02:14:18,994 --> 02:14:20,628
Let go of me. Let go of me.

1638
02:14:22,928 --> 02:14:24,445
I will kill you!

1639
02:14:27,944 --> 02:14:29,958
Let go of me. Let go of me.

1640
02:14:33,180 --> 02:14:36,261
I will not spare you.
I will not spare you.

1641
02:14:38,841 --> 02:14:42,286
Jai, just stop her from
speaking anymore.

1642
02:14:48,721 --> 02:14:49,199
No!

1643
02:14:50,934 --> 02:14:51,641
No!

1644
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:55,161
Please. No! No!

1645
02:14:55,580 --> 02:14:56,536
No!

1646
02:15:10,793 --> 02:15:13,740
I will kill you! I will..

1647
02:15:14,188 --> 02:15:15,472
I will kill you!

1648
02:15:33,869 --> 02:15:35,599
Sheikh sir.
- Thank you.

1649
02:15:46,896 --> 02:15:47,910
Move the car away!

1650
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:49,994
Hey! Move the car away!

1651
02:15:52,349 --> 02:15:53,869
Hey! Take it away! Move your car!

1652
02:15:56,074 --> 02:15:57,004
Move your car!

1653
02:15:59,285 --> 02:16:00,286
Move your car!

1654
02:16:01,743 --> 02:16:02,869
Move your car!

1655
02:16:14,869 --> 02:16:16,743
Look, who is it?

1656
02:16:35,540 --> 02:16:37,916
Tell me where is Pooja?
- I don't know.

1657
02:16:37,996 --> 02:16:38,726
Tell me.

1658
02:16:39,099 --> 02:16:40,183
I will tell you. I will tell you.

1659
02:16:40,266 --> 02:16:42,498
Baburao has sold Pooja to Sheikh.

1660
02:16:42,706 --> 02:16:45,517
He is taking her abroad
in the flight at 2.30.

1661
02:17:13,652 --> 02:17:16,642
Yeah! I have finally hanged you up.

1662
02:17:16,725 --> 02:17:17,808
You rascal!

1663
02:17:22,901 --> 02:17:24,225
Hey! Who are you?

1664
02:17:24,388 --> 02:17:26,517
I am the same person on whose
wife you had fallen down.

1665
02:17:26,686 --> 02:17:28,433
And like the heroine Reena
Roy of the film 'Nagin'..

1666
02:17:28,517 --> 02:17:30,517
..even I have pictured
you in my eye.

1667
02:17:30,678 --> 02:17:32,562
That is why, even I have hanged you.

1668
02:17:32,642 --> 02:17:34,350
First you come here
and make her tall.

1669
02:17:34,601 --> 02:17:36,016
Hey! Because of you, my honeymoon..

1670
02:17:36,099 --> 02:17:37,183
..has been postponed.

1671
02:17:37,266 --> 02:17:38,350
You come and make her tall.

1672
02:17:38,433 --> 02:17:39,955
Otherwise, I will hang you.

1673
02:17:40,035 --> 02:17:42,683
Put me down!
- Put you down!

1674
02:17:42,767 --> 02:17:44,642
Hey! I will send you to
heaven from there itself.

1675
02:17:44,725 --> 02:17:46,163
You don't know me well!

1676
02:17:46,507 --> 02:17:48,540
Look, I am.. I am telling you..

1677
02:17:48,620 --> 02:17:50,209
What are you telling me?
Are you my father?

1678
02:17:50,289 --> 02:17:51,517
Hey! It is not the time
to say anything.

1679
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:52,286
It is the time to do something.

1680
02:17:52,366 --> 02:17:54,266
And I will do it right now, right
here. You don't know me well!

1681
02:17:54,350 --> 02:17:55,433
My husband, what is this rubbish?

1682
02:17:55,517 --> 02:17:56,443
Will you just keep talking to him?

1683
02:17:56,523 --> 02:17:57,267
Please do something.

1684
02:17:58,016 --> 02:18:00,266
Hey! You have made her size short.

1685
02:18:00,346 --> 02:18:01,600
But her mouth is still very big.

1686
02:18:01,683 --> 02:18:03,433
She speaks so much. I
have lots of problems.

1687
02:18:03,517 --> 02:18:04,683
Do you know about that?
- My dear husband!

1688
02:18:04,767 --> 02:18:07,642
Shut up! If you will say
another word now..

1689
02:18:07,725 --> 02:18:10,433
..then I will kill you right here.

1690
02:18:10,513 --> 02:18:11,642
You don't know me well!

1691
02:18:15,222 --> 02:18:16,433
Oh my God! What happened?

1692
02:18:16,513 --> 02:18:17,767
What has happened?

1693
02:18:17,847 --> 02:18:18,934
I have become short.

1694
02:18:19,016 --> 02:18:20,013
Absolutely perfect!

1695
02:18:20,093 --> 02:18:22,016
