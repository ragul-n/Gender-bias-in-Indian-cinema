1
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,850
PULICHARLLA, 25 KMS AWAY
FROM NAGARJUNA SAGAR.

2
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,786
Oh dear!

3
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,445
I am lying in the lap
of tides, expecting you!

4
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,626
I am immersed in the river of minds!

5
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,491
I am drenched in the rain of perspirations

6
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,310
The flesh in heart is blazing!

7
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,642
The yearning is a flame
and has kindled passion!

8
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:49,151
Memories about you showered like a mist

9
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,819
All coming days will not be ours

10
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,191
Memories alone would be my gift

11
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,719
You are my breath, acknowledge it!

12
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,053
Come to me like a pleasant drop!

13
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:07,893
The universe is like a hell without you!

14
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:14,734
Sympathise with me
No evidence about you!

15
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:21,574
Every moment my mind looks for you!

16
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:28,414
Why are you silent?
Don't keep a distance

17
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:34,423
You are running away
from me! Is it fair dear?

18
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,292
There are wounds of passion with in

19
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,628
Future days would be torrid

20
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:24,470
Is this love or revolution?
Do you know what it is?

21
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:31,310
You are far away like a distant lamp
My burdened life has been cursed!

22
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:38,150
Sweet heart! My dear!
Come on, at least today!

23
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:44,820
Be a dream in my eye!
Be in my hug at least for a minute!

24
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:50,833
I want to take rest!
Will you come dear?

25
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,058
I liked Policeman's job.

26
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,053
But, a life was exposed
to danger because of me.

27
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,895
I must get up... no...
I'm not able to.

28
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,397
There are 2 bullets in my body.

29
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,228
I think it would've
ruptured my intentions.

30
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,900
They have wounded them.
It is terribly painful.

31
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,075
I mustn't die.

32
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,569
He would've kidnapped Maya

33
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,404
I must definitely save her.

34
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,243
Get up!

35
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,074
I must get up.
Get up.

36
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,085
My name is Ram Chandra.

37
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:25,753
Ram Chandra I.P.S.

38
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,087
My life is dedicated to the three letters
following my name.

39
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,091
My penance!

40
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,089
My 24 year penance!

41
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,759
I was selected in I.P.S.
At that age.

42
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,436
My life was meandering
into a rut till then.

43
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,100
Then, It changed drastically.

44
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,101
At 27, I joined as ASP in
Kakinada, Vigilance Department

45
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,777
After that a lot of transfers
in different cities

46
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,940
I loved my profession
And I received the prestige for that job

47
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,613
Then one day, Hyderabad city, Crime branch

48
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,458
June 24th. The beginning day for all

49
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,461
To stop the crimes in the city...

50
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,630
...we launched Criminal Intelligence Unit

51
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,468
As an officer on special duty
I took in-charge of the CIU

52
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,462
I formed a team

53
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,466
Rajesh, worked with me in Kakinada

54
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,805
Srikanth, My batch mate in Academy
He is a good friend too

55
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,811
Jagan. Last year Academy's topper
My junior in Vijayawada

56
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,483
We four, were together on training
in the commando batch

57
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,489
We feared nothing.

58
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,488
They called us "Calves"
in the department.

59
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,172
We searched every nook and corner
of Hyderabad and gathered information...

60
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,667
...about the rowdies and criminals
who were not on record

61
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,512
This dossier contains Andhra's
five important gangsters' information

62
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,847
Individual information
about each of them

63
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,192
Dass. Until now,
no Police record has his photo

64
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,527
This is an exclusive video
shot by an informer

65
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,365
Das. He is responsible for 3 murders
and 2 kidnaps in the last two months

66
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,530
He is the dangerous fellow of them all

67
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,869
All the rowdies in the city
would flee if we kill him

68
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,865
Mental Krishna. A rapist!

69
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,538
He only molested a girl who
was returning from her school

70
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,544
Oblesh! He is the supplier of bombs
and rowdies to gangsters in the state

71
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,542
'Guktka' Sambha. He hails from
Madurai district in Tamil Nadu...

72
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,544
...and selling drugs
in the name of 'Gutkha'

73
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,888
He kidnaps kids and
uses as drug peddlers

74
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,891
Another one is Shankar.
Encroaching is his main activity

75
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:40,888
He belongs to Madapuram area

76
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,057
He is Seshav Reddy.
A sadist!

77
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,225
He harasses girls and if they
don't budge, he kills them mercilessly

78
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,733
That file has got their movements,
criminal activities and...

79
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,904
...information about them
required for this case

80
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,067
Even during our meeting now,
our team is watching them

81
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,577
We're awaiting your instructions.

82
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,579
That Das is important to us

83
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,073
You can take a call
on the spot about others

84
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,245
But Das should die

85
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,085
You should boost your
self confidence for this operation

86
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,255
The bullet that you are going to use
would change your life entirely

87
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,923
After you kill that gangster,
their accomplices...

88
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,261
...would become foes to you

89
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,926
They would definitely trail you

90
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,262
And most of the time
your life wouldn't be their target...

91
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,261
...but your courage
and your beloved ones

92
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:24,932
We are ready for the hunt, sir!

93
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,432
I'm nearing Darga.
Bring the money.

94
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,771
If you inform the Police, I'll kill you!

95
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,499
There may be at least 5 people inside.

96
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,666
Why've come here like supermen?
We could've brought 4 more men

97
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,005
- Try to adjust man!
- Ok

98
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,355
Sambha brother, Police...

99
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,691
Come fast

100
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,776
Police dog!
What's your name?

101
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,116
They've told about you.
You won't go out alive from here.

102
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,788
Son of a widow!
Come on!

103
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,458
You scoundrel...

104
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,000
You rascal...

105
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,514
Come on Seshu Reddy! You said that you
would flee if you're taken to the court

106
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,011
Now we'll see
who'll run away

107
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,350
Your wife came yesterday
She cried about you

108
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,019
She told, it would be
dangerous if you come out

109
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,018
Your daughter would be
happy if you die

110
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,354
This is for them
Go, go!

111
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,198
How dare you harass
your own daughter?

112
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,234
A vehicle is coming
I think that's the one

113
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,573
Ram, that is the right vehicle

114
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,075
- Will it will stop there
exactly as he said? - Certainly

115
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,429
This time we should give a
colour TV to your informer

116
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,756
He has given correct information

117
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,766
It's ok. Come let's go

118
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:55,930
I am not coming

119
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,430
Rajesh is waiting for us
He cannot handle it alone

120
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,108
Rajesh! Don't stay there.
Take an auto and go

121
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,275
We are not going to arrest him today

122
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,610
What's your intention?
Why shouldn't we arrest him?

123
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,949
Why should we?

124
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,948
This Mental Krishna is a
serial killer... Rapist!

125
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,280
He will come out is we arrest him

126
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,115
Police has no cases filed against him

127
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,292
He has a Political background
There is no evidence and witness

128
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,790
We can arrest him now, but Devi, the
13 year old girl, who was molested by him

129
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,964
She can't come from the
hospital bed to depose him

130
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,298
She is hapless

131
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,139
I saw her a week before
She is lying like a corpse

132
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,638
No use arresting him now

133
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,475
What shall we do now?

134
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:44,812
Let's kill him

135
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:48,983
Is he dead?

136
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,986
Escape from here

137
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,655
He is dead sir!

138
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,989
If he's arrested, Government has
to spend money

139
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,332
We must use a vehicle,
and fill it up with diesel...

140
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,826
...4 of our department people
in uniform must secure them

141
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,000
...Court... case... Judge...
These are all unnecessary expenses

142
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,002
Now, just a bullet!

143
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,503
At my cost!

144
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,504
Just Rs. 50!

145
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,844
Devi would feel happy to hear this

146
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,175
We've done with him,
haven't we?

147
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,841
Have you understood
what you have done?

148
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,183
Human rights & life aren't
respected in this country.

149
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,519
It is not your problem alone
to save the human rights

150
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,017
Our department is to save only that

151
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,187
Not only the rights, it is our
duty to save people's life

152
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,853
The guys whom you're sympathizing,
only are the spoiling human rights

153
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,861
That's why I stopped their interference
and saved the human rights

154
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,694
In our Constitution, people's rights are
more important than the rogue's rights

155
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,204
And above all, we don't have
any personal enmity between us

156
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,872
Moreover we are taking risk
in each operation

157
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,703
We've got information that Oblesh's
accomplices are planning to kill us

158
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,212
Is this the gratitude we
get for doing our duty?

159
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,379
To tell frankly, as far as I am
concerned they are not humans

160
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,383
They are Animals

161
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,723
Despite hearing all this,
if you want to punish us...

162
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,886
...punish us SPCA Act.
We'll accept it

163
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,070
All four of us were transferred
to different departments.

164
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,239
I was transferred from the
Crime Branch to Control room

165
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,077
I was sorry only for one thing.
I couldn't get Dass

166
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,242
I had a hunch that he
would come after me.

167
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,409
Control Room!
An easy job.

168
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,585
But, PoliceDepartment is like that.

169
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,584
No job is permanent.

170
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,420
In which ever branch you are, do your
duty sincerely, is my motto.

171
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,921
3 months in crime branch, is hell

172
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,927
It's like a sitting on land mines

173
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,766
Enough of this fear of
dying every moment.

174
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,269
We can live happily
for another few days

175
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,600
Now look at my hubby!

176
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,435
He'll be with me instead of the evenings

177
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,440
How many times should I repeat it?
I am a late police incharge

178
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,608
Whatever it may be

179
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,276
Haven't you fulfilled
the task given to you?

180
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,283
No, not yet over.

181
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,118
I am hungry, shall we
eat somewhere?

182
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,958
I want to eat a wedding feast

183
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,794
Ram, why don't you get married?

184
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,797
What dear? Are you asking me to
marry for having a wedding feast?

185
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,466
Anyway why are you asking me?
Ask Srikanth

186
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,299
He is roaming with a girl! Ask him
whether he's planning to marry her?

187
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,143
I am like Lord Sri Ramachandra

188
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:26,808
You know about me dear!

189
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,814
Anyway ask Jagan.
He is sending SMS to a girl.

190
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,479
He'll forget everything if
he gets a reply from her

191
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,651
- Is it true? - Yes
I spoke to her

192
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,485
But, it'll take sometime for marriage
She asked me to develop my complexion

193
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,320
All girls cannot be like Sandhya

194
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,490
Next encounter is yours
I'll arrange a real wedding feast

195
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,160
Anyway there are thinking to marry

196
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,829
Why are you escaping from the marriage?

197
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:49,830
I'm a Ioner!

198
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,499
I don't have any relatives.

199
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,167
But I am happy

200
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,335
There are many officers
with wives & children.

201
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,334
Unlike them,
I have the independence

202
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,845
I've courage to
face anyone... anywhere.

203
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,848
Then, one day, Maya stepped
into my life like a dream

204
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,342
Maya... my beautiful Maya.

205
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,850
Her gait is like tidal waves

206
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,849
She is a beautiful riddle

207
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,192
She is a miracle

208
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,868
It is a cold night

209
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,198
It is a colour of love

210
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,545
It is a colour
A colour of merry

211
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,887
It is a colour
A colour of merry

212
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:59,064
Which sculptors dream are you?
Which heart's desire are you?

213
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:15,917
Are you a vowel in the alphabets?
Are you the jasmine in the plaits?

214
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:26,925
Are you the rainbow in the rain clouds?
Are you a spring flower?

215
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:15,807
Is this fragrance yours?
Is my ecstasy true?

216
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:21,975
You are lighter
than the 'Bondu' Jasmine!

217
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:28,319
Even if I close my eyes
I see you!

218
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:36,662
While singing about you
I become spellbound!

219
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,668
Are you the new wonder of wonders?

220
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,670
You characterize beauty!

221
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:45,893
Your words are sweet
You movements are pretty

222
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:51,906
Sky bows down
because it loves you!

223
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:58,238
Clouds love you and bestow a sari for you!

224
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:06,585
Oh humming bird! Don't run like that!

225
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,420
I feel happy to see you smiling!

226
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,420
It's like a musical rendition!

227
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,977
I had met girls in my life,
but nobody disturbed me like her.

228
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,648
Hey! Take a U-turn.
- Sir, Take a U-turn fast.

229
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:13,820
Leave me! Wait!

230
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,326
What are you doing here?

231
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:24,831
Wastrels!

232
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,831
Are you all students?
Which college?

233
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,666
Hey! Come here

234
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,836
Your tooth is broken!
Go home like this

235
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,342
What about you? Don't look like that

236
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,678
How dare you tease the girls?

237
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,017
What about you?
How old are you?

238
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,184
If I give a blow...

239
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,020
- Come let's go!
- Get lost

240
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,032
Go

241
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,696
Come on

242
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,536
I saw her for the first time that day.

243
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:06,533
I can never forget the anger and
fear writ large in her eyes.

244
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:15,882
Again her...

245
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:20,888
Many years after leaving college
I gave a second look to a girl...

246
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,906
I don't believe in fate.

247
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,914
But, again and again...
...she's coming.

248
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,086
Are you coming?

249
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,954
Your anklet.
I found it in the lift

250
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,291
That is not mine

251
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:33,793
You also know that

252
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,975
That's mine.
It fell in the lift

253
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,139
Is it yours?

254
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,658
Tell that I've reached the spot.
Clear them all!

255
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,655
No one must stand there.

256
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,666
Who are they? Is this done by
Gopal and his accomplices?

257
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,494
- Is this Gopal a rowdy?
Do you know him? - No sir

258
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,500
You won't say even if you knew

259
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:14,834
Give me a pack of King's cigarettes

260
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,843
- No need sir!
- Are we friends?

261
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,353
- Give me quickly.
- Ok madam

262
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,040
Are you residing here?
Where's your house?

263
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,712
Give me a coconut.

264
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,550
I'm asking you only.

265
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,223
I asked where's your house

266
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,889
Do I know you?
I don't need to answer you.

267
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,558
Give it quickly

268
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,833
She doesn't like me.
I liked that.

269
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,740
Take Rs.100. I'll take the
change later. - Okay, madam.

270
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,734
I'm no expert about girls.
But, I felt a girl must be like her.

271
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,754
- Where is your license?
- I have the license but at home

272
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,923
- You should not use this road
Why have you come?

273
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:39,919
I thought it is a short cut

274
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,085
Give me ten minutes
and I'll be back with license

275
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,761
Nobody can wait for you
We have lots of work

276
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,089
Constable, ask him
to pay the fine

277
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,765
I don't have money now!
Don't insult me in front of the girl

278
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,094
I am working in a software company
If you've doubts, look at my ID

279
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,929
- Take it sir! - I don't
bother where you work

280
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,100
First show me the license

281
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,444
I saw her again 2 weeks later.

282
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,281
What's the problem?

283
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,950
He doesn't have a license
and papers for the vehicle

284
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,283
If asked, he tells
cock and bull stories

285
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,458
- What is your name?
- My name is Raja

286
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,626
I know about you sir

287
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,628
We both together solved a
land problem, do you remember?

288
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,464
What's your name?

289
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:33,467
Where's your house?
No.3, Krishna Nagar, Jubilee Hills.

290
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,639
You refused to tell me earlier.

291
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,820
Where are you coming from. We're
coming after watching a movie.

292
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:44,818
Do you've tickets?

293
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:45,985
That tickets...

294
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,485
There was an offer for a juice
against the ticket's counterfoil

295
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,320
We replaced it for a juice

296
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,656
- Are you brother and sister?
- No sir, we are friends

297
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,499
Friends means?
- That means just friends

298
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,332
Why are you using this road?

299
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,832
Why did you cross them?

300
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,504
You were using it as it is a shortcut

301
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,015
Give him the keys

302
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,198
I've taken commissioner's signature.
Don't wait for him.

303
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,099
He's little busy with Chief guests. You
go and present this file in the Court.

304
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,365
I'll talk to you in the evening.

305
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,540
After that I met her
a month later.

306
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,220
My name is Maya.
- I know. I remember.

307
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,893
I want to say sorry to you.
I had been a little harsh.

308
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,232
I didn't know then that
you were a Police Officer.

309
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,228
I understood it from your dirty look.

310
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,895
Did you think I was chasing you under
the pretext of returning the chain?

311
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,606
So, you've realized that a Police Officer
will not behave cheaply. Isn't it?

312
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,751
There's a special respect
for Police, isn't there?

313
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,080
Good! Go ahead... ask.

314
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,752
- What?
- You wanted to apologise.

315
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,923
It's good not to talk to strangers
but, never underestimate others.

316
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,104
What're you doing here?

317
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,940
Teacher in Vignan Vidyalaya...

318
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,980
What are the subjects you teach?

319
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:58,621
Maths for 12th standard is very difficult.

320
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,625
What's your qualification?
- Msc. Maths... IIT Madras.

321
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,387
IIT students can get good jobs in America.

322
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,955
- How come you're a teacher here?
- I like teaching profession.

323
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,053
Sir, I'm Maya speaking.
Do you remember me?

324
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,388
Vignan Vidyalaya.

325
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,857
I do remember you...
Tell me

326
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,856
I'm calling from the school,
we've a problem here.

327
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,409
- Sorry for calling you here.
- No problem, tell me.

328
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,870
She's my student Roshini.

329
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,552
Her house is in Miyapur
Her neighbourhood isn't good.

330
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,085
A boy there is teasing her everyday.

331
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,884
And he is forcing her
to roam with him

332
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,048
Yesterday he had hit her
along with four guys

333
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,057
She is scared and didn't
inform her parents also

334
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,560
They are waiting for her
after her school hours

335
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,890
What do you want us to do?

336
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:51,058
Can a Police action solve this?
She shouldn't face any problem.

337
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,569
Which area?

338
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:58,909
Are they here, Roshini?

339
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,108
They're sitting on the wall

340
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,569
That guy who is wearing an Orange T shirt

341
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,247
Go there!

342
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,446
Don't be scared. I'm here.

343
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,748
Go back casually. Don't let
them know I'm here.

344
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,106
That girl

345
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,038
Hey, girl!
Come here

346
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,475
Why are you not stopping?

347
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,614
If you don't, I'll barge in your house
and pour acid on your mother's face.

348
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,952
Come...

349
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,114
Why are you late from school?

350
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,954
Come... Why're you going away,
when we were waiting for you?

351
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,121
Don't you like me?
Look at my face and tell me?

352
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,624
Will you lose anything if
you go out with me?

353
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,631
Why're you making me angry?

354
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,970
- Lf I get angry, Boys, tell her.
- What does he lack?

355
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,478
He'll drink a full beer bottle non-stop

356
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,114
Brother, why do you still talk?
Pour acid on her face.

357
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:13,114
Sami, give the bottle.

358
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:16,485
Give it

359
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,484
Take the bottle brother

360
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,493
No

361
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,488
- No. - Do you
know what is this?

362
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:26,823
Do you know what'll
happen if I pour it?

363
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:30,662
- Pour it brother.
- Shall I pour?

364
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,666
Don't wait, pour it

365
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,691
Who are you?

366
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,857
Run away
Oh gosh!

367
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,865
- Come here
- I'll beg you sir

368
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:10,031
It's just plain water.
It was all for fun only sir

369
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,209
To threaten her I
said that it is an acid

370
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,170
I swear.

371
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,906
I am telling the truth
It's just water

372
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,040
Look I am drinking it sir

373
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,249
Just for fun

374
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,886
No bullet. Just empty pistol.
Got scared?

375
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,399
- Yes sir
- You...

376
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,072
Come on.
Did you call me?

377
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,404
Come here man.

378
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,070
Don't beat me.
I am a pilgrim

379
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,083
- I am a pilgrim
- So what?

380
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,751
I'll kill you rouges
Go away.

381
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,095
Roshini, go home.

382
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,627
You'll not have problems in future.

383
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,264
I'll put two men
on guard from tomorrow

384
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,271
I'll get down here.

385
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,612
- What if it had been really acid?
- My face would've got disfigured.

386
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,942
I can't even imagine it

387
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,961
Only now you were thanking God!

388
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:45,299
After that, her face and her eyes used
to haunt me now & then like a painting

389
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,019
I was sitting with a friend in that
coffee shop. I saw you.

390
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,986
I've come to take you
for a cup of coffee.

391
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,833
I'm on duty now.

392
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,335
CM is crossing this road,
I must be here.

393
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,011
Then, join us after CM crosses
this road. We'll wait for you.

394
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,175
Will you come?

395
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:32,678
I don't know how much time it'll take.

396
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,348
Don't wait for me.

397
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:03,543
- Who is she? Your friend?
- Mind your business Ansari

398
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,583
Go fast!

399
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:48,415
Tears that seldom come from my eyes
fell on her forehead that day

400
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,753
I've seen many people
hurt in accidents.

401
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:54,757
Grizzly murders. Disgusting scenes.
Nothing ever disturbed me.

402
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,263
But, when I saw her severely hurt,
I couldn't bear it

403
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,270
Her name is Maya.
She's a Teacher in Vignan school

404
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,938
- Inform them. - Give them my mobile
number if necessary. - Ok

405
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:05,938
I forgot to say!
Today is Sunday.

406
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,778
Call the Principal at his
house if nobody is in the school!

407
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,774
Her sister's house is
at Nagarjuna sagar!

408
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,449
They've left for Bangalore
and no one is there

409
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,618
We are trying to contact them!

410
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,784
Try to inform this to them!

411
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:45,642
Impressive lover!

412
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:46,816
Fix that saline bottle!

413
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,486
We'll have wait for
another 24 hours

414
00:44:53,023 --> 00:45:01,488
Impressive lover!

415
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,175
Dear oh dear!

416
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:21,010
Dear oh dear!

417
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,527
- How are you?
- How are you?

418
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:37,863
It's very painful.

419
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,371
Nothing will happen!
You'll be alright.

420
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,866
I'll inform the doctor

421
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,879
Any way you weren't there
when CM passed that way.

422
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,317
You were taking me to the
hospital in your car.

423
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:00,881
Couldn't you've joined me for
a coffee when I invited you?

424
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,888
Why're you serious?
I just said it for fun.

425
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,559
I was seeing you and missed to
see what was coming opposite me.

426
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,570
No fault with that water Tanker

427
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,248
- Is doctor coming?
- He'll come

428
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:30,918
He only admitted Maya!
Come on

429
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:36,750
She's Swathi, Maya's sister.
Maya's brother in law. DCP Ramachandra

430
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,758
- How is she now? - A small
head injury and a hand fracture.

431
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:41,760
You may go and see her.

432
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:42,928
Come on

433
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,441
Sit down!

434
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,948
#NAME?

435
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,291
- I'll come later
- Ok

436
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,953
- It seems you're spending
more time at the hospital. - Not like that!

437
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,798
I went twice to see her.
I didn't see her at the second time

438
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,974
But, I'm always thinking about her
even when I'm working.

439
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:32,978
Nothing like that.

440
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,985
I feel I am the responsible
for that accident! That's all.

441
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:40,314
I don't like that!

442
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,991
I've decided not to see her again.

443
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:53,166
I should be angry with you! You never
met me after that in the hospital!

444
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,667
I got discharged a month ago!
But you never made a phone call!

445
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:01,500
I was wondering whether
I am expecting too much from you!

446
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,346
Not like that!

447
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,187
You've come to meet me. Couldn't you
bring a flower bouquet?

448
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,023
Why do you take out a gun?

449
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:30,203
You may be a Police Officer
Everyone may be scared of you.

450
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,209
But, you don't know how to
talk or move with a girl.

451
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:37,371
- Accept it?
- I agree

452
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,384
You're very uncomfortable.

453
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,578
I'll be back in a 15 mins
Is it ok?

454
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,748
Even your sister is uncomfortable
whenever she sees me.

455
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,759
I observed it in the hospital.
Did you ask her why?

456
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,595
I know. You're a
police officer, that's why.

457
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,265
You're sitting here and
talking to me, that's why

458
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,099
Wrong-doers or criminals can
feel uncomfortable on seeing me.

459
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,099
Why should your sister...?

460
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:35,769
Are you saying my sister is a criminal?

461
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,102
That's what I wanted to say.
Please tell this to your sister also.

462
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,774
Is it? I'll see.

463
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,445
We'll see.

464
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,942
Let me see how normal a person
you're in future.

465
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,859
- I am Maya! -Tell me
- I want to meet you

466
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,463
Thanks for accepting
my invitation.

467
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,299
Why're you so formal?

468
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,967
- You might be busy today.
- I am not busy today

469
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,474
You wouldn't come if you are busy!

470
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,640
Is the city peaceful?

471
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,148
It'll be peaceful,
if you're here.

472
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,158
I find only 4 walls around me
even in my dreams

473
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:32,521
That's why I decided to
come out and I did!

474
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,198
I am planning to go
Nagarjuna Sagar tomorrow!

475
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,528
My sister and Brother in
law were there only!

476
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,000
Sister is there now!

477
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:45,837
I want to see her! Normally I'll
go there every Saturday!

478
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,178
Bus travel would take three hours
I am going tomorrow

479
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,687
Can you come with me?

480
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,684
There is one beautiful place!
It would be good if you accompany me

481
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,193
You said that you are not busy

482
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,600
Your fragrance dear, is a morale booster!

483
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:17,763
This is the eleventh wonder!
It is like embracing rain drops!

484
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:24,777
Our acquaintance is blissful!

485
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:29,611
It is my first experience!
Unforgettable!

486
00:51:54,845 --> 00:52:01,978
Don't give a furtive look and disturb me!
Like a fishing bait...

487
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:09,986
Don't entice me with your talk
Don't taunt me!

488
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,330
Shall I tell the truth?

489
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:26,998
Shall I tell the truth?
Shall I tell my mind?

490
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:31,011
My mind is filled with joy!

491
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:34,911
Never before I felt this joy!

492
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:39,010
I am not sure!
I think it is love!

493
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:47,193
What would it be called?

494
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:55,201
Is it love?
With whom shall I elucidate?

495
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:37,745
Never heard before the
music emanating from her lips

496
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:46,083
It would stir even a
serene person's nerves gradually - Hello!

497
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:49,588
I don't know what has happened!
I think it is love!

498
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,594
My style has changed!

499
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:57,763
I don't know what is this intoxication?
What is this desire?

500
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:01,768
My young mind is asking you only!

501
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:13,446
You have changed me with your talks
and gave me courage to love

502
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:22,122
You have come in my eyes
and have pushed me!

503
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:44,146
I don't know a place
beautiful than this in the world!

504
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:45,811
I also don't like to know about it!

505
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:47,647
This wood house is ours!

506
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:50,482
When my parents were here
we visit here every weekend

507
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,990
This house has seen my
happiness, sorrow and everything

508
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:56,325
I wanted you to come here

509
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:04,164
Oh humming bird! You made me
realize this panic is also a desire

510
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:13,003
You are a boon to make
my dreams come true

511
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:20,672
This world is new!
Looks like it is new born!

512
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:28,018
I was changed because of you!
I am crazy about you

513
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,757
- I want to talk to you.
- What's it!

514
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:46,435
An incident on the day
I met with an accident.

515
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:50,936
Your shirt was drenched
with my blood.

516
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:53,275
You tied a kerchief
to stop the bleeding.

517
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:57,605
You ordered the driver
Ansari to go fast.

518
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,950
I know everything
I was watching it all

519
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:04,950
Your eyes were filled with tears

520
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:09,454
Why?

521
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,458
Everything before me turned dark.

522
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:22,498
But, I knew I wouldn't die.
I made a prayer at that time

523
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:25,966
When I regain consciousness
I wanted to see you.

524
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,307
It happened exactly like that

525
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:30,138
You were in front of me then

526
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:36,815
When I feel that, my life has
been started newly from that time!

527
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:46,656
I'm telling you unabashedly
Actually I never feel shy.

528
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:48,159
I love you.

529
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:55,003
No. Don't say you love me...

530
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:01,567
Before you said about your love,
there was a special feeling between us.

531
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,202
That was very nice.
Let us maintain status quo.

532
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:11,509
It was my mistake.
I should've expected this.

533
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:15,688
I don't have any great reason.
I've got used to living alone.

534
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,856
There's no place for another
person in my home.

535
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:25,693
Did I ask your opinion about me?

536
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,205
Did I ask you accept my love?

537
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,037
I opened my heart to you.

538
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,044
I expected such a reply from you.

539
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:40,712
Time's up!
Let's go

540
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:57,059
She was changing my world
in front of my eyes. I didn't like that.

541
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:02,734
I thought of going away from her.
But, I couldn't.

542
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,756
- How are you?
- I am fine

543
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:22,921
Have you started going to school again?

544
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,094
Yes, for the past 2 weeks.

545
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,757
Have you come to meet me?

546
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:30,258
I know no one else here.

547
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,263
Ok, Let us talk! Come.

548
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,620
I'm unable to concentrate.

549
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,129
I'm unable to take classes.
I've forgotten my mathematics.

550
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:04,463
I've lost appetite,
I'm sleepless.

551
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:07,803
I've come to tell you,
it's because of you only.

552
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:16,805
I had decided not to meet or talk
to you. But I couldn't be like that!

553
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:21,810
I like you. I've come here to ask
you to accept my love.

554
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:40,661
You said earlier that you were
a normal person.

555
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,837
You're not a normal person.

556
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,176
Had you been one, you wouldn't
have rejected my love.

557
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:19,875
I love you.

558
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:24,406
You're not a normal person.

559
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,708
Had you been one, you wouldn't
have rejected my love.

560
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:43,755
DCP sir, I'm surprised
to find you here.

561
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:47,065
I know no one else here.

562
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:50,929
I've so much to talk to you. Shall we?

563
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:53,573
Come.

564
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:03,577
Maya, what do you want?

565
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:08,253
- I didn't get you.
- What do you want us to do together?

566
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,760
I want to marry you.

567
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:22,931
I must spend my life with you.
I want to be with you.

568
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:25,437
I want to talk to you happily.
I want to fight with you.

569
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:26,938
I want to cry resting
on your shoulders.

570
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,270
I must be mad about you
always like I'm today.

571
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:33,615
I want at least 3 children from you.

572
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,450
They must be like you in
appearance & character.

573
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:37,479
I must see these eyes, always.

574
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:43,615
- Then, one fine day I want to die.
That's all. - Why?

575
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:47,625
I'm not a happy go lucky man.

576
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:57,803
My life is at risk, always.
Why do you want me?

577
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:01,306
You wouldn't understand
if I tell you.

578
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:06,146
We'll marry.

579
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:15,988
I like you very much.

580
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:19,718
Ever since I saw you
for the first time...

581
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:24,659
But I had fought with my heart.
I don't want to hide it anywhere.

582
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:27,662
We'll marry in a month's time.
Okay?

583
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:46,852
A drop of tear in her eyes.
A flash of happiness on her face.

584
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:49,850
She gave a contentedlook
I can never forget it.

585
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:54,021
I decided right then to live with her.

586
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:04,704
Next day... Srikanth, Rajesh, Jagan and me,
were transferred to the crime branch.

587
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:10,038
First, we re-opened gangster Dass's file.
Operation Dass kicked off.

588
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:17,042
10 days prior to this.
Panda entered my life on that time.

589
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,378
Panda! Born and brought
up in Berampur in Orissa...

590
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:24,890
At 19, he killed his father and
ran away to Mumbai.

591
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:33,724
8 years later... Mumbai Police is after him
with 32 criminal cases against him.

592
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:44,239
15 extortions, 9 murders, 5 kidnappings
2 rapes and 2 kidnaps, one bank robbery.

593
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:51,609
Finally, he murdered a
local MLA Ashwin Naik.

594
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,748
- Who are you? - Where is Ashwin Naik?
- Who are you? - I came to kill him

595
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:02,090
- Anybody please help us!
- Dad!

596
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:07,099
Panda was arrested
He were there for 6 months 8 days...

597
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:09,100
...on the 9th day he escaped.

598
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,269
Sensation was created in Mumbai city

599
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:17,943
Panda reached Hyderabad
after escaping from Mumbai.

600
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:24,612
When we re-opened Dass's file,
we went through his history.

601
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,279
There was only one
information we don't know!

602
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,117
Crime branch which was searching
Dass's missing brother...

603
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:31,625
...was Panda,
who had fled from Mumbai.

604
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,137
Brother is coming!

605
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,137
Greetings!

606
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:49,978
Panda Brother!

607
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,477
This is our place.

608
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:57,016
All are our boys. They'll give
their lives for me. For you too

609
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,012
6 months imprisonment was like hell

610
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:07,986
When I heard you were in jail,
I was be numbed.

611
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:09,161
I ran out of ideas.

612
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:12,167
- Police has increased the
pressure on me here also. - Police!

613
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:14,335
I just sat like that.

614
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:16,171
What would the police will do us?

615
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:22,838
One police officer by name Shinde,
in Mumbai, dared to beat me in jail.

616
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:27,005
He'll die in another 30 minutes.
Do you know how?

617
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,509
There won't be a scratch on his body.

618
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:31,516
Salim, tell him.

619
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,020
He has a 15 year old son.

620
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:36,191
They'll kidnap him in another 30 minutes,
confine him for 2 days...

621
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:38,188
...and give a torrid time to Shinde.

622
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:41,363
Later they'll send his
son's body in a parcel.

623
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:43,691
He'll realise it then
Damn Shinde!

624
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:45,560
This will send a message
to all police people.

625
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:49,693
They'll think twice before hitting us.
They'll fear us

626
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:52,069
There're few people here.

627
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:55,036
They'll get sense only if we give them
a few shocks like this.

628
01:06:55,244 --> 01:07:00,546
They are sending message to me
to get out from this town! Rascal!

629
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:06,047
- We'll do it. - Panda has come. Shall
we put up a cut-out for our Panda?

630
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:08,089
That too opposite
Commissioner's office.

631
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:13,550
I've a cut-out for him here!

632
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:18,559
- Who's this?
- I've kidnapped your son.

633
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:21,232
If you want him alive, pay a
ransom of 25 lakhs and take him.

634
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:24,903
Don't go to police station!
Then, it'll not be a kidnap case.

635
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,735
Arrange the ransom,
I'll call you again!

636
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:29,911
Change the sim card!

637
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:34,745
- Will Seetharaman be having cash?
- He's rolling in money.

638
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,910
Despite so many warnings,
he has gone to police,

639
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:41,582
- Arun, what's your age?
- Eleven

640
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:44,092
I think your father
isn't concerned about you.

641
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:47,253
Seetharam doesn't know
about ourselves! We'll show him!

642
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:56,761
Who is that?
What is this? Stop!

643
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,849
Stupid! I told you at once
but that too in a clear terms.

644
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:12,283
I told you not to go to police. We'll
settle it between us. But, you didn't care.

645
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:17,050
Arun who should have been playing
in your verandah is dead now.

646
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,285
You wanted it.

647
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:24,463
You killed my son.
I'll tell you one thing... Leave me!

648
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,468
Stop it! How many people are
there in your house now?

649
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:30,298
People have come to
offer condolences for your son...

650
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:33,307
Did anyone think why your
daughter isn't around crying?

651
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,307
Where's your daughter Rani?
Where's she?

652
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:36,638
Blackguard!

653
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:40,982
Shut up!
Don't shout!

654
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:43,485
Your daughter Rani is with us now.

655
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:48,149
Seetharaman, pay Rs.30 lakhs
and get her released. Don't call the cops.

656
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:55,490
30 bundles of Rs.1000 notes.100
notes is one bundle, brother.

657
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:01,669
He did not heard it earlier!

658
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:06,201
He realised it only after
we kidnapped his daughter.

659
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:09,003
Simple... but it's powerful

660
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:12,877
Beautiful girl, wasn't she?

661
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:19,017
Our boys were itching to enjoy
that girl. But I didn't allow it

662
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:21,689
Never force a girl.

663
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:25,883
She must come of her own.
They must spend their lives at our feet.

664
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:30,528
Brother, whichever city we go,
we must rule over it.

665
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,029
We must create sensation. We must
make this city know our real identity.

666
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:41,031
Crimes started hitting like sea waves.
Hyderabad city was shivered.

667
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:45,870
Dass, in 3 months,
kidnapped 6 people, 4 Extortion...

668
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:49,217
...11 robberies and 13 murders!

669
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:51,884
No please!

670
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:59,716
Don't kill me! I'll give
whatever you ask! Don't kill me

671
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:04,560
He is scared!

672
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:12,403
- How's the vehicle?
- Superb brother, flying like a jet.

673
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:14,575
Jet flies only in the top
This is a car

674
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:19,108
This would be a good place to ours!
A Muslim couple is staying here

675
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:22,148
They won't care about us!
We can pay Rs.1000 per month

676
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:23,482
Brother is coming

677
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:27,077
My department didn't about...

678
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:29,756
Panda's brain behind Dass's crimes.

679
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:35,920
Vizag, Rajamundry, Warangal,
now Hyderabad. We've became Emperors

680
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:39,267
All this only after your arrival, Panda!

681
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:48,944
We aimed at Dass
We decided to terminate him.

682
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:54,609
- Where are you? - I am in Secunderabad
Station -Not in Secunderabad!

683
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:55,945
Come to Kachiguda station

684
01:10:58,153 --> 01:11:00,621
- Is the information correct?
- It's correct

685
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:03,281
They're meeting at Kachiguda station
not at Secunderabad station.

686
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:04,789
Vasu Sait has arrived just now

687
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:10,851
Panda look, Police!

688
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:15,530
Public are there!

689
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:06,076
Dass... You are surrounded.

690
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:09,580
- Ram, weren't you waiting
for this moment? - Yes

691
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:15,454
Like in Ankusham movie, should we hand cuff
him and drag him on the streets.

692
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:18,253
No... we'll kill him.
Ram we'll kill him here.

693
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:23,090
We asked you to quit this place
Did you pay heed? You didn't.

694
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:25,600
Now, you're going to die.

695
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:30,768
Or else we'll arrest him. He'll reveal
few VIP's names. We'll kill them.

696
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,771
There's a large customer support team
behind him.

697
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:37,772
Who needs VIP's names.
Jagan, ask him if he believes in God.

698
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,280
If so, ask him to offer his last prayers
or else tell him to close his eyes

699
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:45,480
He appears to be a theist. I don't feel
like letting him go alive from here.

700
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:49,123
Dass, are you scared?

701
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:52,292
If you're so scared, why did you
come from Orissa to Andhra?

702
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:24,848
Dass, who held this city to ransom
for the past 5 years.

703
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:27,325
A criminal who gave testing
times to the department.

704
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:30,496
He's no more now.
I was feeling proud.

705
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:33,835
I never regretted or felt
pity for killing him.

706
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:37,836
I had only one thought.
This city must be peaceful.

707
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:53,347
But, we never knew that
Panda was there at that time.

708
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,550
Panda, what's all this?
How did it happen?

709
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:30,721
We should avenge
for Dass's death right now

710
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:33,224
All Police Officers must hide in fear.

711
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:35,896
An incident should happen like that
and it must be a ruthless, right now

712
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:37,659
Order us! We'll do
whatever you say

713
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:42,567
Where will be Vasu Sait now?
- We'll find him

714
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:44,729
Police got the information from Vasu!

715
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:48,240
Dass, didn't care about Vasu.
He was never afraid of us.

716
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:51,071
He was not under our control.
That has done all the damage.

717
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:56,608
Vasu Sait must die. His entire
family must meet a ghastly death.

718
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:59,084
- Kill all of them!
- We'll do it. Come.

719
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:03,751
Who is the Police dog?
Who are they?

720
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:05,256
I need their names

721
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:06,586
I want to know where they are staying.

722
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:09,093
Who is the guy who was
like a desperado at that time?

723
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:12,433
- I want to talk to him
- His name is Ram Chandra

724
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:16,004
Ram Chandra, Srikanth, Rajesh, Jagan.
They're a team

725
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:17,765
This encounter has done
under their supervision

726
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,931
Only they were following
Dass for the past 6 months

727
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:24,106
First, By tomorrow's dawn,
let it be anyone in Ram Chandra's house.

728
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:30,276
Father, mother, brothers, sisters,
wife, children... no one must be left alive.

729
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,887
For brother Dass.
It should happen.

730
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:37,788
I must talk to Ram Chandra
While this is happening and he is crying

731
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:40,019
Panda, he doesn't have anyone
you had mentioned now.

732
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:42,960
He is a Ione man.
I know that. We'll kill the whole team

733
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:47,457
We can do what you said!
There's a girl. I've seen her.

734
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:49,969
They were talking to each other near
Commissioner's office.

735
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:52,632
I knew she is his flame!
We'll kill her!

736
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:31,235
Sorry, I was busy last week.

737
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,508
- I read it in newspaper.
Are you free now? - Let's go

738
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:42,516
Panda, look there

739
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:53,428
Weapons are ready on us
Shall we kill her?

740
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:41,074
Shall we make a call to Panda?

741
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:49,754
This is my hide out.
Generally I never invite anyone home.

742
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:53,594
But, why it is so dark?

743
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:55,923
I like it only if it is like this!

744
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:02,092
It's good now. I didn't mean,
it must be like this only.

745
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:03,933
I say it'll be good
if it is like this.

746
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:07,135
Watch, your life will become
colourful hereafter.

747
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:09,800
Even a police officer
would also look good if it is so

748
01:19:14,983 --> 01:19:18,510
Rascal! Scoundrel!
You are responsible for Dass's murder!

749
01:19:18,653 --> 01:19:20,951
Hey, Salim, Sudha...
Chop everyone.

750
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:24,116
- Kill him!
- Go in

751
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:28,451
What are you doing?

752
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:31,290
Who are you?

753
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:36,971
I'll kill you

754
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:45,980
I never laughed this much in my life!
Speak some more

755
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:49,809
There will some
additional benefits if you marry me

756
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,149
Our children will easily get
admitted in my school.

757
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:58,986
No need to apply in advance.
No need to pay donation.

758
01:19:59,494 --> 01:20:03,157
- You needn't stand in queue.
- Really? Then?

759
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:08,996
I'm a qualified Mathematician.
In simple words Maths genius.

760
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:14,165
No need of tuition in Maths for our kids.
You too needn't trouble yourself.

761
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,201
Anyway you don't know!

762
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:24,182
I'll take care of it! Because,
Maths is very important, isn't it?

763
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:31,188
Then, I'm a good singer.
I've learnt classical music.

764
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:37,024
- I know to play Guitar also.
- Really? - Yes

765
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,367
Swith off the tape recorder!

766
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:42,700
So, I'll save some expenses!

767
01:20:59,421 --> 01:21:00,888
Where were you all these days?

768
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:04,392
I was here only.
You didn't see me.

769
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:13,730
- Ram, I'm Jagan speaking.
- Tell me

770
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:16,894
Somebody massacred Vasu's family members!

771
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:20,604
They killed everyone in the hotel
where we had kept them secretly

772
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:24,275
- Who?
- I think Dass's boys.

773
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:27,582
They've killed 5 people
How did they know about this place?

774
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:30,248
Did they got the information
from the department...

775
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:32,751
Ok. I am coming there

776
01:21:49,804 --> 01:21:53,103
- Who's that? - Do you think
that you are smart? Idiot!

777
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:55,938
Who are you?
Tell me your name.

778
01:21:56,144 --> 01:21:58,271
Did you get news about Vasu?

779
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:02,940
It'll take 3 months to clean the
blood stains from his house walls.

780
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:07,118
The biggest mistake in
your life was killing Dass.

781
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:11,653
You shot him dead like a street dog.
You must tell the answer for that

782
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,785
Hey, come to the point.

783
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:17,453
Read my lips.
You'll fear.

784
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:20,796
You'll cry...
You'll feel the pain.

785
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:24,460
You'll regret for
choosing police job.

786
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:30,009
The girl who's in your house now,
that moon-faced, isn't she your concubine?

787
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:33,638
Rascal! I'll kidnap her
before your eyes. Watch it!

788
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:37,682
After that, I'll make you
go from pillar to post. I'll make you cry.

789
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:43,480
I'll rape her and I'll drop her
corpse infront of your house. Watch it

790
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:48,818
I'll kill all the policemen, who
were with you while killing Dass

791
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:50,657
Rascal, It's a challenge.

792
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:54,991
After that I'll talk to you
when you're left alone.

793
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:59,004
Scoundrel! I can kill all the officers
and you today itself

794
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,665
But, you must know that
such an enemy exists.

795
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:05,177
You must fear me. That's why
I've called to inform you.

796
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:10,174
This will happen. It'll happen,
but slowly and before morning...

797
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:14,049
...any time in front of your eyes
You just watch.

798
01:23:49,424 --> 01:23:51,392
Go casually and check outside
if there's anybody standing in our street.

799
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:54,220
- Check it up!
- Ok sir

800
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:10,403
There's an auto parked.

801
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:13,072
Yes. It's parked on the street corner.

802
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:17,241
- Sir, any problem? - Nothing
A phone call threat.

803
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:18,750
Anyway, you both be alert.

804
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:27,421
I am not coming there!
You immediately come to Srikanth's house

805
01:24:27,629 --> 01:24:28,960
Tell Rajesh to come there

806
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:37,838
- What's happening? - I've little work.
I must go. - I'll go home.

807
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,932
No. You come with me.
I'll take you to a place. Come.

808
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:47,546
I'm DCP Ram speaking.
Listen carefully what I am saying.

809
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:49,444
I need our 5 boys
immediately near my house.

810
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:51,945
Not in Police jeep.
Ask them to come in an auto

811
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,686
Ask them to stay at road number 12
which is two streets before to my house.

812
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:56,290
I'll be there within half an hour.

813
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:04,131
Is this how you normally
go out of the house?

814
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:23,472
- Tell me Panda! - Is he inside?
- Yes Panda.

815
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:25,979
- That girl.
- She's also inside... with him.

816
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:29,549
- What about the security?
- 2 constables are there...

817
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:32,148
Any other security, movement of
police vehicles or men. - Nothing.

818
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,657
Can we attack him now?

819
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:38,487
- I think we can!
- Scoundrel, tell me correctly

820
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,701
- Shall we attack now or not?
- We can do that. Sure!

821
01:25:42,036 --> 01:25:47,167
If he goes out, follow him
and inform me on phone.

822
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:50,674
I'm on my way in 20 minutes.

823
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:54,174
Threats are not uncommon
in a policeman's life.

824
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:56,340
But, I was sure it was
not an empty threat.

825
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:59,042
I don't know who he was.
He has already attacked Vasu.

826
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,017
Next he had aimed Maya.

827
01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:03,522
I have a hunch that he'll attack
my house same night.

828
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:05,385
I'm prepared for a counter-attack.

829
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:07,190
Come.

830
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:15,365
- Are you going out? - Yes.
We'll be back in an hour

831
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:18,698
I've many things to tell her about you

832
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:27,548
- What happened Ram?
- A phone call! He never told his name

833
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:31,545
I think he's close to Dass
He only has killed Vasu sait!

834
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:36,383
I could feel anger in his voice
He is following me from the morning

835
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:38,552
- He threatened to kidnap Maya
- Maya?

836
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:41,891
First Maya, then you
and then me!

837
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:44,891
His men are watching my house
from an auto

838
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:49,900
He'll definitely come.
His words are saying that

839
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:52,899
He'll definitely make an
attempt tonight. I must see who that is.

840
01:26:55,276 --> 01:26:59,076
- I've requested for 5 boys,
we are 4, isn't that enough? - Enough

841
01:26:59,447 --> 01:27:01,915
- lf he fails to turn up.
- We'll catch the guys who are in the auto

842
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:12,255
I've spoiled your sleep.

843
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,087
Assume this as an
action episode and enjoy it

844
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:15,762
Forgive me if
it turns out to be a serial.

845
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:14,150
Third house from the left

846
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:19,656
Didn't I say he'll come?

847
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:11,876
Come on Panda! Don't stay!

848
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:15,879
Come, listen to me

849
01:29:17,418 --> 01:29:18,385
Don't leave even a single fellow!

850
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:53,086
Control 4, they are coming
your way! Block them!

851
01:31:07,361 --> 01:31:08,157
Can't you look properly?

852
01:32:12,093 --> 01:32:15,893
Hey police! Have your
bullets exhausted? Scoundrel!

853
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:20,732
Do you know who am I? I'm Panda.
Have you heard about me?

854
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:24,731
Mumbai will shiver if they heard my name

855
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:30,737
Maharashtra police couldn't do anything
Why have you come here?

856
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,578
Now you'll die,
Come on

857
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:24,789
You should pay the ransom of
Dass's death! You must die

858
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:29,794
You stay at my feet or die.
All the city police should surrender to me.

859
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:34,808
I'll take that girl away.

860
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:22,075
Mumbai police have filed
32 cases against him.

861
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:25,919
Dass's home town is Berampur!

862
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:30,579
I got some doubt and I enquired
with Berampur's JCP Patnayak...

863
01:35:31,792 --> 01:35:35,592
...he gave an information that
he is the brother of Dass

864
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:38,598
When we shot Dass in the encounter
Panda was also there.

865
01:35:39,233 --> 01:35:42,100
So, now he wants to
avenge for Dass's death.

866
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:43,600
I'll arrange security
for Maya's protection.

867
01:35:43,804 --> 01:35:44,600
Ram, you give me a letter
regarding this.

868
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:48,098
- Does Maya know about this problem?
- No, sir.

869
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:52,438
You all should be very careful.
This guy seems to capable of anything.

870
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:54,607
I'll arrange an additional security
cover for everyone.

871
01:35:54,815 --> 01:35:57,613
Now, he's a wounded beast
because of your counter attack.

872
01:35:57,918 --> 01:36:00,113
What would be his next step?
- He does not have that much patience!

873
01:36:00,321 --> 01:36:02,289
He'll come definitely with rage

874
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:05,454
If he decides, he can hit us,
anywhere... any time...

875
01:36:11,499 --> 01:36:14,957
It got delayed! Sorry dear, were
you sleeping? - Got drenched? - No, sweat.

876
01:36:15,169 --> 01:36:17,296
Ram, I'll go to bed.
Let's talk in the morning.

877
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:21,970
Take care of him and bring
the water bottle while you are coming

878
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:25,137
He looks tired!
I disturbed your sleep!

879
01:36:25,346 --> 01:36:28,315
- Where is Maya?
- She's sleeping upstairs.

880
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:40,657
- D.C. P sir... what're you doing here?
- Sorry, Maya did I disturb you?

881
01:36:41,028 --> 01:36:41,824
I didn't sleep at all.

882
01:36:43,531 --> 01:36:45,328
You sleep.
I'll sleep in the sofa downstairs

883
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:47,826
We've to go from here at 5 a.m.
I came here to tell this.

884
01:36:48,869 --> 01:36:52,566
Where are you going?
Sit down.

885
01:36:55,042 --> 01:36:55,838
Sit down

886
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:05,519
- Aren't you sleepy?
- Why don't you talk with me for sometime?

887
01:37:06,053 --> 01:37:09,853
Was your job successful?
Tell me

888
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:13,857
You're in a problem
because of me

889
01:37:17,064 --> 01:37:19,862
Till such time, if you stay
in a safe place, I'll be comfortable.

890
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:21,866
Shall I lie on your shoulders?

891
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:24,867
I don't find any other
safe place than that.

892
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:14,417
Maya, it's serious!
We should be careful.

893
01:38:14,955 --> 01:38:16,923
I'll wake you up 5 'o' clock.
You sleep.

894
01:38:21,295 --> 01:38:24,423
What danger can I face in your presence?
Won't you save me, hitting everyone?

895
01:38:25,132 --> 01:38:26,099
There's danger only for your enemies!

896
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:42,778
- Do you know how
old am I? - 24 yrs.

897
01:38:44,151 --> 01:38:46,449
- Ask me, why did I
ask this? - Why?

898
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:52,121
I'm waiting for this kiss for 24 yrs.
Now, I can't wait for even for a second.

899
01:39:17,685 --> 01:39:19,653
I think I'll start living
with you from today itself.

900
01:39:20,688 --> 01:39:22,656
You rejected that day!
But you talk otherwise now.

901
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:24,657
We can't trust police's words!

902
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:46,005
Where is the guts you had
while killing Dass? Now, show me!

903
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:50,951
I want to know some details!
Where have you kept that girl

904
01:39:51,385 --> 01:39:54,684
Tell the where is the resident
of the remaining officers. Tell me fool!

905
01:39:55,055 --> 01:39:59,014
Tell me! I don't have patience
You'll die if you won't say that!

906
01:39:59,226 --> 01:40:00,022
Tell me idiot!

907
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:07,593
- Won't you sleep? - It's 4.00 A.M.
What's the use of sleeping now?

908
01:40:08,402 --> 01:40:10,700
You said, we've to go somewhere
at 5. I've school tomorrow.

909
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:13,699
Take off from the school for some time.
The situation is not good.

910
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:26,550
My name is Panda! I told you before that
many things will happen before dawn!

911
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:28,886
I am in your friend Jagan's house

912
01:40:29,757 --> 01:40:32,055
If Police get scared,
he would become an ordinary man

913
01:40:32,993 --> 01:40:34,221
Now your friend situation is the same

914
01:40:34,928 --> 01:40:36,054
Do you want to watch it?

915
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,064
Why the door is open?

916
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:44,297
It's all because of Dass's encounter.

917
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:47,296
Why should Jagan die for that?

918
01:41:48,168 --> 01:41:49,294
Take this body to Osmania Hospital!

919
01:41:51,505 --> 01:41:54,303
He is an young chap!
He had dreamed a lot about his future

920
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:55,304
We did our job!

921
01:41:57,177 --> 01:41:59,975
Who's he? Did he
consider police so vulnerable?

922
01:42:00,848 --> 01:42:01,644
Can't we do anything?

923
01:42:03,283 --> 01:42:06,150
How dare he kills a police officer
on his own house?

924
01:42:07,354 --> 01:42:08,150
We should not leave him!

925
01:42:12,025 --> 01:42:16,325
I can understand your feelings!
But, don't take any decision in a hurry!

926
01:42:18,866 --> 01:42:20,333
Where are Maya and Sandhya?

927
01:42:22,035 --> 01:42:24,333
After I came here, I made a call
to the control room inspector...

928
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:25,998
...and have sent them to your office

929
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:29,008
We can't keep them here Ram.
We'll send to some other place!

930
01:42:30,477 --> 01:42:32,001
Tomorrow, I'll arrange a meeting
with the intelligence force

931
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,006
I'll arrange the additional force!

932
01:42:34,715 --> 01:42:35,682
We should inform this to DGP

933
01:42:37,217 --> 01:42:40,675
- Do Jagan have any realtives?
- No one like that!

934
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:44,681
- We are everything to him!
- Make arrangements for his funeral!

935
01:43:20,761 --> 01:43:21,557
Start the car

936
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:35,568
Brother, police!
Run away!

937
01:43:38,779 --> 01:43:40,246
Saleem Brother!
Police!

938
01:43:42,783 --> 01:43:43,579
Oh gosh!

939
01:44:18,652 --> 01:44:19,448
Leave me!

940
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:44,808
He's 'Penknife' Srinu

941
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:46,646
Sharp knife Srinu.

942
01:44:46,847 --> 01:44:48,314
- Where is Panda?
- I don't know

943
01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:52,148
If you want to arrest me.
I'll become an approver.

944
01:44:52,853 --> 01:44:53,649
Who is going to arrest you?

945
01:45:12,706 --> 01:45:13,502
Panda brother is arriving!

946
01:45:18,145 --> 01:45:22,343
Panda, they've killed my brother...
- Don't worry, I'll take care.

947
01:45:22,883 --> 01:45:27,183
- Take him inside.
- Don't cry! - Nothing to worry!

948
01:45:38,732 --> 01:45:41,030
You nasty police!
Don't you get sense at least now?

949
01:45:41,568 --> 01:45:44,196
Now only I've killed your man!
Don't you get sense?

950
01:45:45,405 --> 01:45:47,873
Where is your girl friend?
Isn't she with you?

951
01:45:48,241 --> 01:45:51,039
She is with me!
Will you come and watch?

952
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:55,378
Why are you lying, stupid?
Wait for me. I'll come

953
01:45:55,749 --> 01:45:58,217
Ok. Come right now!
I'll wait for you!

954
01:45:58,418 --> 01:46:01,387
I don't want you,
but I want your team!

955
01:46:01,755 --> 01:46:04,383
Then I want your girl friend and
I want all who are close to you

956
01:46:04,591 --> 01:46:08,049
After your dear ones die, and you're
left alone, on the time you are sobbing...

957
01:46:08,428 --> 01:46:10,055
...then I want to talk to you
sitting in front of you!

958
01:46:10,263 --> 01:46:13,562
- I am coming! - Why should
you come? Nasty fellow

959
01:46:13,767 --> 01:46:15,394
Tell me where are you?
I'll come

960
01:46:19,773 --> 01:46:21,741
- What happened? - You said
you wanted to talk to me

961
01:46:22,275 --> 01:46:24,243
That we have talked in
afternoon, that I am going to Sagar

962
01:46:24,778 --> 01:46:25,574
About that only!

963
01:46:27,447 --> 01:46:28,914
It's only 3 days, since
Maya left this place.

964
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:32,751
Situation is not good here
Are you going?

965
01:46:34,287 --> 01:46:36,915
I can't stay here like a coward
by sending her there.

966
01:46:37,891 --> 01:46:41,588
She must be with me!
I've decided after a long thought!

967
01:46:42,462 --> 01:46:44,259
I'm going to marry Maya tomorrow.

968
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:50,263
After I stay for one day with her,
I'll bring her back with me!

969
01:46:50,804 --> 01:46:53,432
Maya should be with me in my house.
It would be safe for her

970
01:46:54,307 --> 01:46:57,276
Where are you going to get married?
Won't you tell me?

971
01:46:58,145 --> 01:47:01,444
I know it only when I go there
Might be in her house or in some temple.

972
01:47:01,815 --> 01:47:03,282
Anyway, I'll call up and tell you

973
01:47:06,987 --> 01:47:07,954
Just now, I've informed Rajesh

974
01:47:08,321 --> 01:47:09,618
I was thinking to tell this to you
But, you've come

975
01:47:10,157 --> 01:47:11,124
Shouldn't we come for your marriage?

976
01:47:11,391 --> 01:47:14,121
No. All of us shouldn't be
together at one place.

977
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:17,958
It would be better if you
stay here in this situation!

978
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:20,297
I'll bring Maya here
after the next day of our marriage

979
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,295
Then we'll have a party together!

980
01:47:23,937 --> 01:47:25,632
I want to talk to Sandhya
Give me her phone number

981
01:47:26,573 --> 01:47:27,801
Sandhya is staying with her friend

982
01:47:28,341 --> 01:47:29,137
There is no phone there

983
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:32,307
It won't be good.
I want to inform her! How?

984
01:47:32,512 --> 01:47:34,980
She'll call me after sometime
I'll tell her to talk to you!

985
01:47:36,349 --> 01:47:40,479
After you go there,
call me about your whereabouts

986
01:47:41,521 --> 01:47:42,317
Sit down

987
01:47:50,096 --> 01:47:50,892
Sit down

988
01:48:19,392 --> 01:48:23,351
I cannot forget the murder of Jagan!
He should not have died

989
01:48:24,397 --> 01:48:26,024
I am get raged whenever
I think about that!

990
01:48:26,733 --> 01:48:27,859
We should kill him

991
01:48:57,497 --> 01:49:01,558
Next day, July 3rd evening,
We got married

992
01:49:02,168 --> 01:49:03,635
Her people agreed to it happily

993
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:06,968
Of all the marriages I have seen,
ours was the best

994
01:49:19,185 --> 01:49:24,987
It would attract me even
if my eyes are closed

995
01:49:25,458 --> 01:49:33,661
For singing a song praising
my eyes couldn't get words!

996
01:49:33,867 --> 01:49:36,995
Are you the new
wonder of wonders?

997
01:49:37,704 --> 01:49:40,502
Definition of beauty is 'You'!

998
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:25,547
How are you?
What happened?

999
01:50:25,919 --> 01:50:27,887
Marriage was held at
6 o clock in the evening

1000
01:50:30,323 --> 01:50:33,383
Rajesh also wished you.
Where are you? Are you at home?

1001
01:50:33,927 --> 01:50:37,556
No. They had a property
20 km away from Sagar

1002
01:50:39,032 --> 01:50:41,398
It's a beautiful place.
We'll be here in this evening

1003
01:50:42,268 --> 01:50:45,169
- When'll you be back?
- Tomorrow evening, I'll be back with Maya

1004
01:50:45,438 --> 01:50:48,066
- Sandhya hasn't called to me
- She called me just now

1005
01:50:48,274 --> 01:50:50,071
I told her to call you!
She'll call you immediately

1006
01:50:50,276 --> 01:50:51,072
Keep your mobile on

1007
01:51:02,789 --> 01:51:03,653
What are you doing?

1008
01:51:09,629 --> 01:51:10,425
Come

1009
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:21,940
- Are you happy?
- Why?

1010
01:51:22,709 --> 01:51:25,269
But never seems like that
There is some afflict on your eyes!

1011
01:51:25,712 --> 01:51:28,943
- Is it about Jagan?
- He is a very good friend

1012
01:51:29,549 --> 01:51:30,607
That should not have happened to him

1013
01:51:35,655 --> 01:51:39,455
Leave that! Are you happy?
That's what I want

1014
01:51:48,001 --> 01:51:51,300
- Shall I tell one thing? - What?
- You are very handsome

1015
01:51:54,007 --> 01:51:57,807
- Many of them would say this to you
- I don't know about that...

1016
01:51:58,411 --> 01:51:59,469
...But I know one thing.

1017
01:52:01,848 --> 01:52:02,872
You are so beautiful

1018
01:52:10,023 --> 01:52:11,047
This mind is crazy!

1019
01:52:12,358 --> 01:52:15,327
I though it would be enough if
I am with you for three births

1020
01:52:16,529 --> 01:52:19,828
But, now I am thinking that the moment
which I spending with you now is enough

1021
01:52:21,201 --> 01:52:22,668
I am ready to die even now

1022
01:52:43,556 --> 01:52:48,687
Oh handsome!
Take my beauties!

1023
01:52:48,895 --> 01:52:54,026
Hug me tight!
All the beauties are for you!

1024
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:59,531
Oh handsome!
Ajasmine is calling you!

1025
01:52:59,739 --> 01:53:05,041
Handsome! Catch the areca
nut on the flower cot!

1026
01:53:05,245 --> 01:53:10,547
Desires flow like Godavari

1027
01:53:10,750 --> 01:53:15,710
This glamour doll is all yours

1028
01:53:15,955 --> 01:53:21,222
Play and sing with me tonight

1029
01:54:03,469 --> 01:54:13,105
I've kept some places for you
which are not exposed to air

1030
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:19,111
My beauty and glamour are only for you

1031
01:54:19,819 --> 01:54:29,126
Waiting for a long time
for a consort to hug me

1032
01:54:30,163 --> 01:54:35,294
My youth and life is only for you

1033
01:54:36,002 --> 01:54:41,304
Why were you away for so long?

1034
01:54:41,507 --> 01:54:47,139
Moments of happiness
are in front of us

1035
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:37,527
Your physique creates craves
to my fondles and my sari

1036
01:55:38,064 --> 01:55:42,694
I never felt like this before

1037
01:55:46,572 --> 01:55:56,038
Your affection created a thrust for
my breath and my growing desire

1038
01:55:57,083 --> 01:56:01,884
I am forgetting this world

1039
01:56:02,755 --> 01:56:08,057
My silence vanished
when I am with you

1040
01:56:08,261 --> 01:56:14,063
This eternal bliss makes me sing

1041
01:58:41,581 --> 01:58:45,881
Didn't I tell you, I'll come?

1042
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:55,727
Hit him and throw him in the water.

1043
01:58:57,663 --> 01:58:58,459
Hit him

1044
01:58:59,432 --> 01:59:00,228
Hit him

1045
01:59:01,934 --> 01:59:02,730
Come

1046
01:59:04,770 --> 01:59:06,670
- Leave me
- Come

1047
01:59:07,773 --> 01:59:08,569
Hit him

1048
01:59:37,637 --> 01:59:38,695
Kill this scoundrel!

1049
01:59:41,474 --> 01:59:42,600
Why do you make a fuss?

1050
01:59:57,657 --> 01:59:58,453
What?
Come on!

1051
02:00:04,830 --> 02:00:07,958
What?
Want to die?

1052
02:00:37,697 --> 02:00:42,066
This is for brother Dass
Bring her, we'll go

1053
02:01:22,742 --> 02:01:23,538
Look there!

1054
02:01:30,249 --> 02:01:31,716
He is breathing
Come and help me

1055
02:01:32,351 --> 02:01:33,215
Search for Maya

1056
02:03:15,287 --> 02:03:18,313
Will you be able to dance?
Will you be able to watch?

1057
02:03:18,457 --> 02:03:21,756
Will you be able to stop?
Is it a floral chaplet?

1058
02:03:30,903 --> 02:03:40,107
Is it a warmhearted feeling?
Or a gala music in young mind?

1059
02:03:40,479 --> 02:03:43,676
Is this a boon to the eye?

1060
02:03:43,816 --> 02:03:49,618
Is it an adolescent beauty?
Is it a shrouded glamour?

1061
02:03:49,822 --> 02:03:55,783
It is a new palanquin's desire
Come with your adolescence!

1062
02:04:21,187 --> 02:04:30,152
If 'vasthu' at home needs total change
I can do it for you!

1063
02:04:33,699 --> 02:04:39,331
The beauty before you,
will lessen your desire!

1064
02:04:39,538 --> 02:04:42,336
Will you wage war on my lap?

1065
02:04:45,878 --> 02:04:51,839
The beautiful girl was hot!
When time waged a war

1066
02:04:52,218 --> 02:04:57,178
Are you hesitating to mingle?

1067
02:05:35,761 --> 02:05:41,063
Oh, Love!
Oh adolescent!

1068
02:05:48,274 --> 02:05:54,235
Mind perceives a Cupid!
Body languishing in separation!

1069
02:05:54,413 --> 02:05:57,405
Created some desire in my mind

1070
02:06:00,786 --> 02:06:06,588
Love is everything
It is heavenly bliss!

1071
02:06:06,792 --> 02:06:09,590
It is an yearning of the adolescent!

1072
02:06:13,132 --> 02:06:19,093
Floral bed provoked to wage war
The milky sculpture wants to proceed!

1073
02:06:19,471 --> 02:06:24,773
Is the little dream so ecstatic?

1074
02:06:59,011 --> 02:07:02,845
Is it a desire?

1075
02:07:33,679 --> 02:07:37,638
Shall we talk?
Are you in a mood to talk?

1076
02:07:49,695 --> 02:07:52,858
Shouldn't I touch you?
Ok. Leave it

1077
02:07:56,368 --> 02:07:57,494
You can't move

1078
02:07:59,705 --> 02:08:02,674
I can do anything
Can you bear it?

1079
02:08:03,709 --> 02:08:05,540
Can DCP Ramchandar bear it?

1080
02:08:15,721 --> 02:08:19,020
Are you an American product?
You don't look like a Telugu

1081
02:08:19,391 --> 02:08:22,519
That color, counters and...

1082
02:08:26,398 --> 02:08:29,196
But I never eat spittle food!

1083
02:08:30,402 --> 02:08:32,700
Both of you celebrated nuptial night
yesterday, didn't you?

1084
02:08:33,572 --> 02:08:34,869
Was it good?

1085
02:08:39,912 --> 02:08:41,880
You don't need this, remove it.

1086
02:08:42,081 --> 02:08:44,049
Are you need this nuptial thread?
I say remove it

1087
02:08:44,616 --> 02:08:48,052
Will he come?
Speak out

1088
02:08:50,089 --> 02:08:51,556
What would he do if he comes here?

1089
02:08:58,897 --> 02:09:00,228
With whom he is playing?

1090
02:09:01,767 --> 02:09:03,234
Four people were doing brutal acts

1091
02:09:03,435 --> 02:09:07,895
Having a gun, they thought that
they could kill anyone at any cost.

1092
02:09:08,974 --> 02:09:10,407
This would be a good lesson for them

1093
02:09:11,043 --> 02:09:14,410
Hereafter, every single policeman
will be scared to come forward.

1094
02:09:14,980 --> 02:09:18,245
Will any kid choose his career as a police
after hearing this news?

1095
02:09:19,785 --> 02:09:23,243
Within a snap, all went wrong,
did you see that?

1096
02:09:24,456 --> 02:09:28,825
That is what life is
For all the humans, including the Ram

1097
02:10:06,965 --> 02:10:09,456
I don't want this injection
I don't have time to talk to you

1098
02:10:13,172 --> 02:10:14,469
I have to go urgently from this place

1099
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:16,634
You can't go in this situation

1100
02:10:30,856 --> 02:10:32,824
Take the injection. Otherwise,
the condition would be serious to you

1101
02:10:35,861 --> 02:10:37,988
Just a minute. Relax your self

1102
02:10:41,533 --> 02:10:43,831
What is going on here?
I can't understand

1103
02:10:43,969 --> 02:10:46,665
- Get out for two minutes
- I have to give an injection

1104
02:10:46,772 --> 02:10:48,171
Get out for at least two minutes

1105
02:11:10,662 --> 02:11:14,189
Why Srikanth?
Is this for Sandhya?

1106
02:11:26,745 --> 02:11:28,042
I betrayed you.

1107
02:11:32,584 --> 02:11:34,211
I blemished my job.

1108
02:11:39,258 --> 02:11:40,725
They took away my Sandhya.

1109
02:11:42,427 --> 02:11:43,894
I only left her at the airport

1110
02:11:45,264 --> 02:11:46,891
I don't know how she got caught by them.

1111
02:11:48,667 --> 02:11:52,228
They called me.
They hit her infront of me.

1112
02:11:53,272 --> 02:11:54,569
They said, if I don't co-operate
with them...

1113
02:11:54,773 --> 02:11:57,571
...they'll slash Sandhya's head and
send a parcel of her head

1114
02:11:57,943 --> 02:12:01,071
At that time I felt she is
important than anything else

1115
02:12:03,448 --> 02:12:05,746
- Get back
- Don't do anything to her

1116
02:12:05,951 --> 02:12:07,680
- What do you want?
- Move

1117
02:12:07,786 --> 02:12:08,753
Tell me what I have to do?

1118
02:12:10,956 --> 02:12:12,116
I only exchanged your gun.

1119
02:12:12,958 --> 02:12:15,586
I only informed them about your
staying place on your nuptial night.

1120
02:12:17,963 --> 02:12:19,590
I didn't know what
I was doing.

1121
02:12:20,632 --> 02:12:21,792
They stayed in my house

1122
02:12:22,968 --> 02:12:26,096
They allowed Sandhya to talk to
me once every hour.

1123
02:12:26,972 --> 02:12:28,769
Suddenly, they left the place
early in the morning 4 o clock.

1124
02:12:30,309 --> 02:12:32,607
Only then, I realised.

1125
02:12:33,312 --> 02:12:35,109
I called Rajesh and told him everything.

1126
02:12:38,150 --> 02:12:40,948
We decided to come to your place
immediately. We informed the commissioner.

1127
02:12:41,820 --> 02:12:46,780
I phoned you on the way.
But, you never responded.

1128
02:12:52,331 --> 02:12:54,128
What are you doing?

1129
02:12:58,870 --> 02:13:01,964
I couldn't be a friend
or a policeman.

1130
02:13:08,847 --> 02:13:12,476
When I think about it now,
even my Sandhya won't forgive me

1131
02:13:14,353 --> 02:13:17,481
I can't be forgiven!
Don't forgive me, Ram

1132
02:13:47,552 --> 02:13:52,182
Please, leave me.
Let me go from here.

1133
02:13:52,391 --> 02:13:54,359
Let me go

1134
02:13:55,060 --> 02:13:58,029
Shut up! I'll kill you!

1135
02:14:02,901 --> 02:14:05,529
I am Panda speaking
How are you?

1136
02:14:07,239 --> 02:14:09,537
Who'll take care for the city,
if all police officials stay there?

1137
02:14:09,908 --> 02:14:13,207
- What do want?
- I know you are a wastrel

1138
02:14:13,412 --> 02:14:17,712
No use talking to you
Give the phone to Ram, quickly!

1139
02:14:47,446 --> 02:14:48,413
Speak with him

1140
02:14:51,450 --> 02:14:55,910
Can you hear me, Maya?

1141
02:14:58,457 --> 02:14:59,583
I am alright, Maya!

1142
02:15:06,631 --> 02:15:10,089
- You don't be scared. - Enough!
- I'll come to save you

1143
02:15:12,471 --> 02:15:14,939
You are a real man!
You've survived it

1144
02:15:15,474 --> 02:15:17,271
Do you remember what I told you?

1145
02:15:17,375 --> 02:15:20,435
That is I'll send your girl back
after she satisfies me!

1146
02:15:21,980 --> 02:15:25,780
Now, we'll stop that.
That also in my style!

1147
02:15:26,151 --> 02:15:27,948
There is an area called
Zaherabad which is...

1148
02:15:28,220 --> 02:15:30,780
...100 km away from Hyderabad,
in Mumbai highway!

1149
02:15:31,156 --> 02:15:32,953
If you want her, come there!

1150
02:15:33,825 --> 02:15:37,454
Don't come alone! Bring that
2 of your policemen with you

1151
02:15:38,330 --> 02:15:41,458
Ram Chandra, if you have guts...
If you want these girls,

1152
02:15:41,833 --> 02:15:43,960
Come to Zaherabad!
You three alone

1153
02:15:46,004 --> 02:15:47,130
What did he say?

1154
02:15:49,508 --> 02:15:53,342
Maya is with him. He called
me to come there. We should go

1155
02:16:01,419 --> 02:16:04,820
He said that he'll kill your whole team
Then why are you going alone?

1156
02:16:06,358 --> 02:16:08,986
This should be handled carefully
In this situation...

1157
02:16:10,028 --> 02:16:10,824
We should go

1158
02:16:11,530 --> 02:16:14,829
This battle was started by us
We should end it

1159
02:16:48,567 --> 02:16:49,363
Come

1160
02:16:54,072 --> 02:16:55,369
It's time for you to go!

1161
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:58,206
Your beautiful face should
watch by your husband!

1162
02:16:58,310 --> 02:16:59,368
Start to go

1163
02:17:07,085 --> 02:17:09,076
Freshen up

1164
02:17:10,255 --> 02:17:12,723
You should look like an angel

1165
02:17:14,926 --> 02:17:16,393
I'll take you to a place

1166
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:04,498
- I know what would be on that
- Nothing would be in it

1167
02:19:08,540 --> 02:19:11,839
Who is he? Should we surrender to him?

1168
02:19:14,212 --> 02:19:15,509
Can't we do anything to him?

1169
02:20:02,594 --> 02:20:07,054
Ram, check whether it's Sandhya.

1170
02:20:10,435 --> 02:20:12,062
Ram, check whether it's Sandhya

1171
02:20:18,610 --> 02:20:21,738
That is Sandhya, isn't it?

1172
02:20:29,287 --> 02:20:30,276
She is my Sandhya, isn't it?

1173
02:20:34,125 --> 02:20:37,925
Oh gosh! All went wrong

1174
02:20:38,963 --> 02:20:40,089
All went wrong, isn't it?

1175
02:20:44,469 --> 02:20:49,600
I betrayed you, Ram.
I've betrayed myself

1176
02:20:51,476 --> 02:20:53,103
Ram, Maya was kidnapped because of me

1177
02:20:54,979 --> 02:20:56,276
They've killed Sandhya, Ram!

1178
02:20:57,982 --> 02:20:59,449
They sliced her head, isn't it?

1179
02:21:26,845 --> 02:21:29,336
- I want to see her face
- No

1180
02:21:31,349 --> 02:21:33,340
- I want see what they did
to her face! - No

1181
02:22:17,729 --> 02:22:19,196
Oh gosh!

1182
02:23:03,274 --> 02:23:05,003
Hey, how long you'll watch a headless body?

1183
02:23:05,109 --> 02:23:08,078
Isn't it disgusting?
Take it away. Quickly!

1184
02:23:08,279 --> 02:23:09,075
Give me the phone

1185
02:23:11,282 --> 02:23:14,080
Tell me Bose!
It is me, come quickly

1186
02:23:14,185 --> 02:23:15,777
What happened was greater
than we expected, Panda

1187
02:23:15,954 --> 02:23:18,787
That black guy killed himself
after seeing his wife's head

1188
02:23:18,890 --> 02:23:21,085
Ram Chandar vexed because of that
We have won

1189
02:23:21,192 --> 02:23:22,090
That's great

1190
02:23:35,974 --> 02:23:36,770
Stop the Jeep

1191
02:23:45,817 --> 02:23:47,614
Somebody would be there to watch us!

1192
02:23:50,321 --> 02:23:51,151
I'll be back

1193
02:23:52,490 --> 02:23:56,620
That's what I am telling. Yes.
Nobody can harm us

1194
02:24:31,029 --> 02:24:31,996
Walk

1195
02:24:37,502 --> 02:24:38,332
Be careful

1196
02:25:02,727 --> 02:25:03,694
He is Dass's henchman

1197
02:25:03,961 --> 02:25:05,360
He knows where they've kept Maya.

1198
02:25:06,597 --> 02:25:09,862
As it is election time we don't
have that much force right now

1199
02:25:11,402 --> 02:25:13,870
Otherwise, we should take
special permission with the CM. - No

1200
02:25:14,872 --> 02:25:16,362
I'll take them with me,
irrespective of number of persons

1201
02:25:16,474 --> 02:25:18,032
Today evening, they are changing
Maya to some other place

1202
02:25:18,142 --> 02:25:19,234
We should be there before that

1203
02:25:35,626 --> 02:25:38,060
Do you know Nagamani?
She had a big bungalow.

1204
02:25:38,863 --> 02:25:41,923
Bungalow full of prostitutes.
I'm going to leave you there.

1205
02:25:42,266 --> 02:25:44,393
There's a great demand
for your type of girls.

1206
02:25:45,436 --> 02:25:47,904
First, all big shots
in the city will relish you.

1207
02:25:48,439 --> 02:25:51,067
Then, all other men would play with you.

1208
02:25:51,609 --> 02:25:54,237
Then, I'll phone and inform
Ram about your place.

1209
02:25:54,445 --> 02:25:58,745
He'll suffer & die by seeing you.
That is what I want

1210
02:25:59,450 --> 02:26:01,418
- Where is Bose?
- He is yet to come

1211
02:26:01,619 --> 02:26:02,916
Where has this mad fellow gone?

1212
02:26:04,622 --> 02:26:05,418
Hold her

1213
02:26:10,795 --> 02:26:11,762
Hold her tightly

1214
02:26:19,270 --> 02:26:20,931
Leave her
Take this

1215
02:26:38,489 --> 02:26:41,287
Shut up Nagamani!
Don't act smart with me

1216
02:26:41,492 --> 02:26:43,119
I won't come to
the place where you call me

1217
02:26:43,494 --> 02:26:44,984
You come to the place,
where I ask you to come!

1218
02:26:45,329 --> 02:26:47,797
I am starting to come there
You get ready to come there

1219
02:26:47,965 --> 02:26:50,456
You must be there within half an hour
I'll call you back

1220
02:26:50,835 --> 02:26:52,462
Do you understand?
Put the phone down

1221
02:26:52,837 --> 02:26:55,704
I can't bear their torture
Cheaters...

1222
02:27:21,866 --> 02:27:24,835
- What vehicle have you arranged?
- I've arranged a water tanker

1223
02:27:25,036 --> 02:27:26,333
That would be the safe for us
Yes, brother

1224
02:27:26,637 --> 02:27:28,832
If we board the tanker at
Koti we can go to Vizag

1225
02:27:29,140 --> 02:27:31,506
- Next day morning 4 o clock
is the boat -Ok

1226
02:27:34,645 --> 02:27:37,842
Brother police!
Run away

1227
02:27:54,065 --> 02:27:54,861
Come on!

1228
02:28:08,412 --> 02:28:09,879
Go, don't wait

1229
02:28:18,422 --> 02:28:19,389
What are you doing, Panda?

1230
02:29:47,345 --> 02:29:48,141
You will be alright

1231
02:29:53,684 --> 02:29:57,142
Look at me
I am here

1232
02:29:57,855 --> 02:30:02,656
Open your eyes. I am taking
you to the Hospital

1233
02:30:29,887 --> 02:30:30,683
After going to Vishakapatnam...

1234
02:30:37,728 --> 02:30:39,025
VISHAKAPATNAM
30 Km

1235
02:30:56,747 --> 02:31:00,706
Old Coastal area
Vishakapatnam

1236
02:31:06,924 --> 02:31:08,721
Where is this boat?
It is yet to come

1237
02:31:10,327 --> 02:31:12,955
- It seems, it'll take 1/2 an hour.
- We will wait

1238
02:31:21,105 --> 02:31:21,901
Go

1239
02:31:33,451 --> 02:31:34,247
Move

1240
02:31:37,455 --> 02:31:39,923
Kill him
He won't come here

1241
02:32:24,168 --> 02:32:24,964
Come on

1242
02:32:26,337 --> 02:32:27,702
Come on.

1243
02:32:28,005 --> 02:32:31,304
Now, is it painful to you?
Come on

1244
02:32:31,675 --> 02:32:33,643
Now, Ram Chandra, DCP is a Ioner

1245
02:32:35,346 --> 02:32:36,142
Come on

1246
02:33:38,576 --> 02:33:43,275
Come on
Get up, man.

1247
02:33:57,261 --> 02:33:58,728
Have you now understood about police!

1248
02:34:44,141 --> 02:34:46,939
Come on...
Get up

1249
02:34:48,579 --> 02:34:51,776
You want to talk to me personally.
I've come here alone. Let's talk.

1250
02:34:52,149 --> 02:34:57,610
Scoundrel! Talk me.
Tell me some thing

1251
02:34:57,821 --> 02:35:03,123
I have come here. Tell me
Nasty fellow!

1252
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:10,624
How many of you?

1253
02:35:13,103 --> 02:35:18,473
For whom?
Dass is a worm!

1254
02:35:20,844 --> 02:35:23,972
You've come for him.
I'll ruin you also.

1255
02:35:25,849 --> 02:35:27,476
If some one else comes for you,
I'll kill him also.

1256
02:37:17,628 --> 02:37:23,089
AFTER 3 MONTHS...
