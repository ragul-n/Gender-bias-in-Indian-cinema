00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,542


3
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,375
What's this, man?

4
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,417
Load has come, sir.
- Why didn't you come at 3 or 4 am?

5
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:02,458
What, sir? Please come, sir.
Got late, sir.

6
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,375
What's this, man? Stinking like hell!

7
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,375
Can't allow you in? Go away.

8
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,250
Of late you're dumping too much,
people are raising objections.

9
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:34,667
Limit your trash.
- Keep this, sir. Take it, sir.

10
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,250
I'll manage here,
get how much ever trash you can,

11
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,375
check post is all yours!

12
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:45,458
Come on, start the vehicle.

13
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:49,708
Move quickly.

14
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:51,458
Get going.

15
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:55,458
Go...go...

16
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,667
Someone please call his home.

17
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:08,042
Please give way!

18
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,875
Move...move...move...

19
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,458
Back...go back.

20
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:25,875
Sir?

21
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:27,875
Please come back.

22
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,583
Hey baby, please move.

23
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,458
No sir...sir...

24
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:44,583
Tell me.

25
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,042
I'll thrash you.
- Sir! Please leave me.

26
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,667
If you make noise...

27
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,042
Sir!

28
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,042
I'll thrash you.

29
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,583
Sir, may be 50 years old.

30
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:58,792
What else?

31
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,000
No marks on body, sir.

32
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:07,000
He vomited blood.

33
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,167
May be suicide, sir.

34
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,375
Maha, manage it properly.

35
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,667
Okay, sir.

36
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,458
I'll manage it, sir.

37
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:18,458
I'll finish it cleanly
and call you later.

38
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,250
There's no evidence of fight also.

39
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,250
Who saw it first?

40
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:29,875
We don't know anything, sir.
- I'm asking you, right?

41
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:31,583
I saw it, sir.

42
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,042
Take his statement and
bring him to station.

43
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:37,917
Okay, sir.

44
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,042
Call ambulance and
ask them to clear the body.

45
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,583
Hey eye witness, come here.

46
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,000
How long, Gomathi? Come quickly.
- Coming, hubby.

47
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:51,375
I've plenty of work outside.

48
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,875
Come quickly.
- What great work? Useless work.

49
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:56,875
All you'll do is discuss
about useless issues, right?

50
00:07:57,042 --> 00:08:01,375
If you think and talk about country only,
where's the time for your family?

51
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:07,042
Politicians are little scared of
few social conscious people like us.

52
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,875
Give me the shirt,
how long will you iron it?

53
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,667
Take it.

54
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,500
You like about society issues only when
they talk on TV soaps and Big Boss.

55
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,000
You may even claim to have
got us freedom too.

56
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,875
Okay, go carefully.

57
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:24,875
Hey, come...
- Leave me, please.

58
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:25,875
You said urgent, right?

59
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:28,042
I can do it later leisurely.

60
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,042
This comes first!
- Yuck! Leave me.

61
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,708
Leave me I say!

62
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,042
Why are you pushing me?

63
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,667
Gomathi...Gomathi...

64
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,375
Hey, Gomathi!
What happened, Gomathi?

65
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,250
Wait...I'm coming...
nothing happened to you...

66
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,000
Gomathi!

67
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,583
What happened to you?

68
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:07,667
What happened to you, Gomathi?

69
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:32,000
Greetings, sir.

70
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,667
How is your health now?
Is it okay?

71
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:35,875
Taking regular medicines, right?

72
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,667
What? Are you okay now?

73
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:39,667
Guna!

74
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:42,667
Hello!
- Greetings, doctor.

75
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,708
Are you better now, Guna?
Is your health okay now?

76
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,583
Yes.
- Good.

77
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,250
Nothing to worry, you'll be fine.
- Okay, doctor.

78
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:01,167
Brother!
- Yes.

79
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:06,458
Guna and his friends are trying
to create revolution in village.

80
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,167
What? Revolution?
- Yes, brother.

81
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,917
We mustn't allow it.

82
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,167
If we let such elements
to do good to the society,

83
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:18,458
they'll dictate terms for us
to use pot or use toilet paper.

84
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,875
You're right, brother.
- Brother, you're rocking.

85
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,375
You're talking politics too.

86
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,458
Keep quiet, man.

87
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:27,000
It's honourable if one minds
his own business.

88
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,917
Do we need politics?
You deal cards, man.

89
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:39,500
Hail victorious brother!
Hail victorious brother!

90
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:45,000
Hail victorious Kaalian!
Hail victorious Kaalian!

91
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,458
Hey, Guna, come.

92
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,708
Brother! Where are the boys?
- Look here, band!

93
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,250
Guna brother...Guna brother!

94
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:14,250
Normally I'm a good man but
if there's a challenge, I take it.

95
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:23,875
Who is up there? Who is down here?

96
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,708
See all lives as equal...

97
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:32,083
To the possible extent, share love...
Carry on overcoming challenges...

98
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:47,875
Must come in the proper way...

99
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,583
Okay sir, I'll take care of it.

100
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,458
Without putting us through hardship.

101
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:05,792
Bless us strength, power and
victory with your grace, Amen.

102
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:11,917
Ramu from station told me police man's
son is going to take us to task.

103
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,667
Bless us Holy Spirit...

104
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:28,000
Why are you dull, brother Guna?

105
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:34,167
Nothing, Gomathi is unwell.
That's why I'm worried.

106
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:38,250
Nothing will happen to her,
why are you worrying so much, Guna?

107
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,875
Buddy, enough! Don't talk too much.

108
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't make fun of him,
concentrate on game.

109
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,875
But something to eat.

110
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,875
Hello Lenin!
How is your leader's film?

111
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:55,375
Why do you ask me that?

112
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:59,708
Right from the first punch line in
opening scene to song, fight and comedy.

113
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:02,000
My leader just rocks in
every scene he appears.

114
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:03,000
Still?

115
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:07,708
Not just that he rocks in the
romantic scenes with dream girl.

116
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,875
What a romance! Sensational!

117
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:14,458
That's okay!
When will your leader enter politics?

118
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,667
Brother, don't talk about
unnecessary things.

119
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,167
What is unnecessary?

120
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,708
How many more years?

121
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,250
You asked it right, brother.
I too had same doubt for many years.

122
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,875
Hey, no need of any trouble.
Come, let's go.

123
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,000
Keep quiet.
- Hey police!

124
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,667
Hey see, what's going on there?

125
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,375
Hey, what are you boys doing here?

126
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,667
Hey porcupine! Are you a playboy?

127
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,458
Trying to trap girls munching
puffed rice balls.

128
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,042
Why are you talking to them?

129
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,875
Get everyone into the vehicle.
- Hey, get into the vehicle.

130
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,875
What did we do, sir?
Hands off me, sir.

131
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,042
Get into the vehicle,
you puffed rice ball.

132
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,875
We didn't do anything, sir.
- Who asked you to come here?

133
00:13:58,042 --> 00:13:59,042
Do you know what problem
is going on here?

134
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,708
How many times I've told you
not to come here? Come home.

135
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:03,042
What's the problem here, sir?

136
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,042
No petrol in vehicle,
will you fill it?

137
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,458
Sir, please sir...

138
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:08,875
No problem, father.
- Leave me.

139
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:09,875
You go home,
I'll talk to him and come.

140
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:13,917
Father, I said go home,
this fool first picked up the fight.

141
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,042
How dare you call me fool!
- Get everyone into the vehicle.

142
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,875
Sir...sir...please leave them.

143
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:19,875
Sir...no sir...I beg falling
at your feet, sir.

144
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:21,458
Get up, father.
Why are you falling at his feet?

145
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,875
Sir, it's life of boys,
please leave them, sir.

146
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:25,875
He'll not come here again.
- I said no, father, please get up.

147
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:28,042
Sir, I'll take care of him,
please leave him, sir.

148
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,875
Why are you falling
at his feet, father?

149
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:31,042
Whatever be the problem,
let's take it head on, father.

150
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,667
Sir...
- Don't cry, father.

151
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,250
Sir...sir...sir...
- I told you, father, please get up.

152
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,042
Get up, father...let's go.

153
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,458
Please listen to me, father...
come, let's go.

154
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:48,792
Sir, I beg you.
Please leave him, sir.

155
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:57,250
Don't dump slaughterhouse waste here!

156
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:03,708
Don't dump medical waste here!

157
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:07,500
Is my village dump yard for you?

158
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,875
Have you taken bribe
to make it dump yard?

159
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:13,708
Stop it...stop it...

160
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:16,875
Make a promise....make a promise...

161
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:20,167
Promise livelihood for us!

162
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:25,708
Ban it...ban it...
Stop it...stop it...

163
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:31,875
Allow us to live!
Allow us to live!

164
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:33,042
Enough of it!

165
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,458
Have you got permission to protest?

166
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:40,458
We thought you'd protect us
but are you threatening us?

167
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,875
Sir, go and call your senior officer.

168
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,875
Hey Guna! Are you bossing over me?

169
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:47,500
Sir, our lifeline is this earth.

170
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:51,708
They're polluting it with dumping
slaughterhouse waste and chemicals.

171
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:57,167
It's stinking so much that school children
and women have to close noses passing it.

172
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,000
We've complained to every officer.

173
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,875
Nobody has taken any action till date.

174
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:04,917
Not just that people are getting affected
with contagious diseases because of it.

175
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:09,625
We too are living here only,
how come you get disease but not us?

176
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,875
Why are you troubling us?

177
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:14,875
There are concerned officers
to look after it.

178
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,458
Are you creating problem
by playing politics?

179
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:20,875
If fighting for right is politics,
we'll surely do it, sir.

180
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:28,875
We condemn Police inaction!

181
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:35,250
Don't threaten working class!
Don't threaten working class!

182
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:41,583
Go...go away, I'll forgive you all.
Go...mind your work.

183
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:51,042
Sword that is sharp on
both sides can cut easily.

184
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:56,875
It has power to split man from soul.

185
00:16:57,042 --> 00:17:01,375
It has strength to cut anything.

186
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:07,000
We look at thoughts and principles.

187
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:11,000
Abraham...4 chapter, 12 verse.

188
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,458
Sorry, father.
We didn't do anything.

189
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:20,250
I didn't know police would
humiliate us like this.

190
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,250
Everyone present there know this.

191
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,250
But nobody was able to talk
because of police, father.

192
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,000
Don't I know about my son?

193
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,667
We mustn't go against
the people in power.

194
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:43,458
How many places that
police officer would've worked?

195
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,250
All we know is this village only.

196
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,792
Our land is important to us.

197
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,667
Let's take a back step.

198
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,667
We don't lose anything doing that.

199
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,667
I know you and Guna very well.

200
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,250
You must learn about politics
at this age.

201
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,667
But you must be wise enough to
know on whom it should be used.

202
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:14,375
Had you or Guna done
anything that day?

203
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,458
Police would've played politics
to turn public against you.

204
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,375
Understand this, son.

205
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:32,167
Son, you're my world.

206
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:37,167
If anything happens to you,
I can't bear it, son.

207
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,792
Take care.

208
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,375
Sorry, father.

209
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,792
Looks like you're in deep thought.

210
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,583
I'm asking you, right? Answer me.

211
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,583
Nothing!

212
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:56,917
Gomathi!

213
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,792
What happened to you?

214
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,667
Gomathi...
- Yes.

215
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:08,583
Whether I'm alive or dead,
the smile on your face mustn't fade.

216
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,583
You must be fine, that's enough.

217
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,917
Gomathi, don't cry please.

218
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,583
Gomathi, don't cry.

219
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,792
I'm talking to you, right?

220
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:54,667
Look at me!

221
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,667
Don't ever talk like this
for fun also.

222
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,375
Look at me, please.

223
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:08,000
Don't cry.

224
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,667
Look at me...smile please.

225
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:13,667
Smile please.

226
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:30,708
Unit one, Coral Draw Basics.

227
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:32,750
Unit two, Drawing and Selecting,

228
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,625
Unit three, Working with task,

229
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,625
Unit four, Working with units.

230
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,125
Lesson started with unit one and two.

231
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,250
Madam, may I come in?

232
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:45,250
Yes, come in.

233
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:12,292
Hey....hey, bro!
What man?

234
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,625
You're not answering my phone calls.

235
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,625
Attitude? Trying to
belittle friendship?

236
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:22,833
No, brother.
Never seen my father crying.

237
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:29,625
He stood before the village in tears
for my sake, it still haunts me.

238
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:35,958
What happened that day wasn't
an insult to your father only,

239
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:37,250
for all of us too!

240
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,958
Let's give that policeman
a fitting reply at right time.

241
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,625
But for that avoiding us is not right.

242
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,542
Who is the girl?
- Who?

243
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,417
I practically raised you
from childhood.

244
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,958
So, you've grown up to date a girl
without my knowledge.

245
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,750
She's studying with you, right?
- Yes, brother.

246
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,625
We're coming to college tomorrow.
- Okay, brother.

247
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:14,917
Let's talk and settle it.
Happy?

248
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:17,833
Don't sit here and day dream,
go home, boy.

249
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:37,750
Hello!
- Have you reached college, Gomathi?

250
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,625
Yes, I've reached college.

251
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,708
Meet and talk to her.
Okay?

252
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:44,708
I'll take care of it.
- Okay, I'll cut it.

253
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:45,708
Okay.

254
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,625
Sister-in-law, she's coming.

255
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:55,917
Sister, please stop for a moment.

256
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,500
My name is Gomathi.
Lenin's sister-in-law.

257
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:02,917
I'll come to the point straight.

258
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:06,917
He likes you very much.
He wants to tell you about this.

259
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,708
For now, just your opinion
is enough.

260
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:11,292
Elders in family with discuss
and fix it later.

261
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,625
What do you say?

262
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,625
Won't he come and tell me directly?

263
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,750
When I enter class and go out
or while eating in canteen,

264
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:18,750
when I wait for bus in bus stand,

265
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,292
he follows me everywhere but
won't talk to me directly, right?

266
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,250
You tell him to come and
talk to me directly.

267
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:27,542
We'll talk over it.
Come girls, let's go.

268
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:32,708
What did she say, sister-in-law?

269
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:34,958
She made fun of you.

270
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,125
What are you saying, sister-in-law?

271
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:38,917
Hey dumbo! She wants you
to talk to her directly.

272
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,250
I didn't get it.
- Didn't get it?

273
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:43,500
She symbolically said she too loves you.

274
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:47,083
What else?
Looks like you've found a love!

275
00:24:55,417 --> 00:25:03,917
O dear, one who entered
my heart through eyes...

276
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:13,292
You're beating in my heart
after making it skip a beat...

277
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:43,292
O dear, one who entered
my heart through eyes...

278
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,708
You're beating in my heart
after making it skip a beat...

279
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:49,917
O girl, you're playing havoc
with my life...

280
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,250
My world is enchanted on
seeing you...

281
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:56,250
O dear, one who entered
my heart through eyes...

282
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:59,292
I'll wait for your love all my life...

283
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,292
Like harvesting paddy,
you took away my heart...

284
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:07,042
But please don't go away
from me, I'll die...

285
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,625
O dear, one who entered
my heart through eyes...

286
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:14,625
You're beating in my heart
after making it skip a beat...

287
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:47,250
Beautiful like classical Tamil...
Epic romantic poem...

288
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:53,625
A marvelous painting in sari...

289
00:26:53,833 --> 00:27:00,125
My heart is after you...
Flying high into sky like kite...

290
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:06,708
I'll always be around you
like the string of top...

291
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,958
O girl, you're playing havoc
with my life...

292
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,125
My world is enchanted on seeing you...

293
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:16,292
O dear, one who entered
my heart through eyes...

294
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:22,708
I'll wait for your love all my life...

295
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:25,917
O dear, one who entered
my heart through eyes...

296
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:29,917
You're beating in my heart
after making it skip a beat...

297
00:27:54,708 --> 00:28:00,958
You've created ripples in the
serene life of a country boy...

298
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:07,417
O beauty, I will wait all my life
for your smile...

299
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:13,542
You've hurt my heart, O dear...
May I apply you as balm?

300
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:20,292
You've entered my life boisterously...
I'll take care of you well...

301
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,292
O dear, one who entered
my heart through eyes...

302
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,708
You're beating in my heart
after making it skip a beat...

303
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:29,917
O girl, you're playing havoc
with my life...

304
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,958
I'll wait for your love all my life...

305
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:36,292
O dear, one who entered
my heart through eyes...

306
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,250
I'll wait for your love all my life...

307
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:42,292
Like harvesting paddy,
you took away my heart...

308
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,708
But please don't go away
from me, I'll die...

309
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:50,417
O dear, one who entered
my heart through eyes...

310
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:54,625
You're my love after
making it skip a beat...

311
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,917
Brother Guna!
- Come, bro.

312
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:10,250
Isai, come in.
- Please come in.

313
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,500
What brings you here unannounced?

314
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,750
You look more handsome
when I see you with sister.

315
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:18,958
You discuss, I'll get you coffee.

316
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:20,125
Wait, I'll also come.

317
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,917
Both of you and fix something.

318
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:28,708
Your home is traditional and very cute.

319
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:31,292
Do you like Lenin very much?

320
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,250
Trust me, I'll die without Lenin.

321
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,958
I'll look after him like his mother.

322
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:38,917
Why are you getting so emotional?

323
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:43,500
Keep your Lenin to yourself,
serve coffee to them.

324
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:49,125
I've given petition in Collector's office,
I think they'll not dump here anymore.

325
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:50,917
Brother, have it.

326
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:55,042
You too.
- What's this?- Coffee.

327
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:57,708
To drink, right?
Drink it carefully, boy.

328
00:29:57,917 --> 00:30:00,250
Lenin, you're very fortunate.

329
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:13,917
Guna...Guna...

330
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,625
Guna!

331
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:17,833
Hey!

332
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:19,917
Guna!

333
00:30:22,292 --> 00:30:23,917
Hey Guna, open the door.

334
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,917
Guna!

335
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:30,417
Wait, I'm coming.

336
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:31,250
Hey!

337
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,125
Guna!
- Wait, man.

338
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,750
Looks like you'll break open the door.

339
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:39,417
Hey Kamarasu! Is it you?

340
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:41,333
What brings you here at this hour?

341
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,167
Buddy, Kerala guys have started it again.
- What are you saying?

342
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:48,125
Yes, buddy.
They're entering with two lorry loads.

343
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:53,042
Stinking like hell.
You come, buddy. Let's stop them.

344
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:54,958
They'll do anything if there's
no one to stop them.

345
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,042
Wait, I'm coming.

346
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,125
Careful, it may blow into a big issue.

347
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:04,167
You sleep silently,
I know what to do with them.

348
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:07,042
If we leave them,
they'll bury us alive.

349
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:14,958
Hello, father.
- Tell me, dear.

350
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,417
Why are you calling
at this hour, Gomathi?

351
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:20,125
Father, Guna is going out.
Looks like there's a problem.

352
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:23,125
Please go and check, father.
- What are you saying, dear?

353
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:27,417
Kamarasu brother told him Kerala guys
were dumping some trash.

354
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:29,625
Why is he getting involved into this?

355
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:39,833
We mustn't spare them tonight. Come.
- Come quickly.

356
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:42,750
Where are they?
- Tonight, we must put an end to this.

357
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,292
Come quickly.
Look there, that lorry, right?

358
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,292
Yes, buddy, that's the vehicle.

359
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,417
Look, they're dumping trash stealthily
after village is sleeping.

360
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:49,625
Come on.

361
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:51,708
They're going overboard as
there's no one to stop them.

362
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:53,250
Brother, please don't beat us.

363
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:57,625
We didn't do it, brother.
- You're ruining the place.

364
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:58,917
Please leave us, brother.
- Will you kill people here?

365
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:02,250
Kamarasu, see what nasty things
they're dumping here.

366
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:06,500
They'll come back for vehicle, right?
Let's take them to task then.

367
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:08,417
They're dumping trash here
to ruin this place.

368
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:09,625
Should we remain silent spectator?

369
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,625
What should we do with them, brother?
- We must do something with them.

370
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:25,958
Buddy, they've dumped left overs
of chicken and meat products.

371
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:31,708
Not just slaughter house waste
but medical waste too.

372
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,250
We mustn't spare them, brother.

373
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:38,500
That bloody Councillor...

374
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,167
Where are you going, Guna?

375
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:46,750
We went to the border of
the village, brother.

376
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,958
Why?
- They've started to dump trash again.

377
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,125
Who?
- Those Kerala guys.

378
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:51,958
Kerala guys?
What are you saying?

379
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:52,917
What's there to say?

380
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:54,750
If we don't protest,
they'll turn this into dump yard.

381
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,708
We must watch it silently.

382
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:59,875
What's this, Guna?

383
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:02,167
Why are you getting involved
into this unnecessarily?

384
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:07,500
I already knew they would start
dumping after village goes to sleep.

385
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,708
Why are you taking risk?

386
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,125
We voted for them, right?

387
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,125
That's why they're making us run
all over place at night like dogs.

388
00:33:16,292 --> 00:33:19,125
Our MLA and Councillor have
to answer for this.

389
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:21,500
Councillor is responsible for this.

390
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,125
We all know this but
who can dare ask him?

391
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:25,292
We must ask him.

392
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,292
We must do something to make them
think about voters while taking bribe.

393
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,708
If we spare them,

394
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:33,250
they wouldn't even blink an eye
to run over us with a bulldozer.

395
00:33:33,417 --> 00:33:37,750
They'll not just kill us,
they'll build grave and swear on it.

396
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,750
What can we do, Kamarasu?
Only get angry on them.

397
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:46,292
Only if we question their every action,
politicians will fear us.

398
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,417
Why unnecessary discussion?
Come, let's go to his home.

399
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:52,500
Let's hold him by his collar,
only then he'll get some sense.

400
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,500
Mustn't spare Councillor.

401
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:59,917
Hey Councillor! Come out!

402
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,750
Come out...come out, man!

403
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:02,917
Come out...come out, man!

404
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,250
He'll sleep like a dead man now!

405
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:12,125
Come out I say!
- Hey come out, man!

406
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:14,042
Hey, come out, man!

407
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:24,625
You can wake a sleeping man
but not who is acting sleep.

408
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,250
Hey, come out, man!

409
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:29,167
When they for votes,
they'll bow and beg us humbly.

410
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:33,292
But we go to them for help,
they'll ignore us as strangers.

411
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,958
We all know this well.

412
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:36,708
What the hell are you talking about?

413
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:39,500
We're shouting here, right?
Come out, man!

414
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,125
Hey Councillor, come out.

415
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:44,125
Come out I say,
hiding in home like a woman.

416
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:45,167
Come out, man.

417
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,917
Are you letting them dump trash
at mid-night?

418
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:56,250
Are you coming out or
want us to come in?

419
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:59,500
He'll sit silently inside like a doll.

420
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:02,625
No use of shouting here.
Come, let's go.

421
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:04,417
All we got from shouting is dry throat.

422
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:08,750
You'll come to us some day, right?
We'll take you to task then.

423
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,958
Why are you sitting silently, brother?

424
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:38,708
Kamarasu humiliated you in public.

425
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:43,917
With police cordon around you,
he called you a coward, brother.

426
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:47,042
He humiliated us in public, brother.

427
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:54,125
Guna went with people at
mid-night to councillor's house.

428
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:56,750
So, Councillor is furious on him.

429
00:35:56,958 --> 00:36:01,833
If we finish him now,
no one will suspect us.

430
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,625
Let's pay and get boys
from outside to do it.

431
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:12,125
We must instill fear in people
about facing dire consequences.

432
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:14,917
This fool was the first
to start the trouble.

433
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:27,167
Can I foresee people would
attack my home at mid-night?

434
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:31,250
Guna was responsible for it.

435
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,708
We let him to involve in
this issue, right?

436
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:38,167
That's why he running
like a bull in China.

437
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,917
Guna is young blood,
it'll talk politics.

438
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:48,708
For our experience,
we mustn't let him into politics.

439
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:54,708
Sir!

440
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:05,708
Everything was fine till now, sir.

441
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:08,500
I trusted only you, sir.

442
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,250
You must fix this issue for me.

443
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:14,250
Don't worry, sir.
I'll not run away.

444
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,417
They weren't wrong,
it's you who did it.

445
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:22,250
When you do something wrong,
ancestors said, do it secretly .

446
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:23,833
Did they say it for nothing?

447
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,167
Elders' words are God's words!

448
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,625
We must understand and follow it.

449
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,708
What's the use of looking at me?
I'm talking to you, Chettan.

450
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,958
Tell me, why you are here?

451
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:35,833
Okay, sir.

452
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:39,750
I'm happy, you said it.
That's okay, sir.

453
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,958
But a small problem, sir.

454
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:44,125
From tonight, extra two lorry loads
would be dumped.

455
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:47,500
Sir, you must clear it from check post.

456
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:53,250
Chettan, it isn't easy like you think.
Problem has taken a turn.

457
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:57,167
Even kids are talking about it
using Facebook and WhatsApp.

458
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,708
Just a misstep and
we'll lose everything.

459
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:05,250
Hereafter every step we take must
be taken very carefully, brother.

460
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,708
You won't face any problem, sir.

461
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:09,250
Everything will go on finely.

462
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:12,250
I'll take responsibility,
take money without pondering, sir.

463
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:14,125
What are you thinking about, sir?

464
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,625
Take it, sir.

465
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,125
Take it, sir.

466
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:20,042
I'm taking risk again for you only.

467
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:36,125
Maha, before matter leaks out,
finish the job.

468
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:40,042
There's talk in village
about dumping trash.

469
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:42,083
I've called the doctor
to run a camp.

470
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:45,042
That's right, brother.

471
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,125
We can't support Kerala guys
going against our people.

472
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:50,625
You arrange the camp.

473
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:54,500
Let's divert people's attention
without marring your name, brother.

474
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,917
I'll give some money, finish it.

475
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:01,500
Maha, it has four.
Finish the job.

476
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:04,125
Okay, sir.
You've given the order, right?

477
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:05,625
I'll do as you say.

478
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,250
Stay aloof from Guna and
village problem.

479
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:19,500
But do it when I tell you, okay?
- Okay, sir.

480
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,208
Councillor and Police are trying
to divert people's attention.

481
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:29,375
Greetings to everyone!

482
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:34,750
Our sir has take special permission
to arrange medical camp here.

483
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:41,958
If all of you give your blood samples,
it'll help us to treat you properly.

484
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,292
Brother, please stop.

485
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:45,958
What are they doing there?
- I don't know, brother.

486
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:46,958
Please co-operate with us.

487
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:58,958
What's this?
No one is turning up.

488
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,375
Let's go and see it, brother.

489
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:30,417
What's going on here, madam?

490
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:33,750
Look sir, people of your village
are not co-operating with us.

491
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:37,208
We can do further treatment only
if they give us blood samples.

492
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:40,417
At least you explain to them, sir.

493
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:50,542
Brother Murthy, sister Geetha,
all of you listen carefully.

494
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,167
Authorities have sent doctors
to check our health.

495
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:54,750
We asked for our rights
with Councillor, right?

496
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:56,750
That's why they're here.

497
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:59,167
What if we don't co-operate with them?

498
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,083
All of you please try to understand.

499
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,542
Your anger is justified.

500
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,375
Spit anger and please come
to the camp.

501
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:07,375
Sister, please come.
Brother, please come.

502
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:10,958
They're here for our struggle, right?
Why have second thoughts now?

503
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,750
Madam, start your work.
- Okay, sir.

504
00:41:54,208 --> 00:42:02,875
Councillor's enmity with Guna and boys.
Appukutty planned to use this advantage.

505
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,167
Brother!
Come in and sit, brother.

506
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:36,542
Would boys finish the job cleanly?

507
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,875
Brother, don't let fear take over you,
go home and sleep peacefully.

508
00:43:50,542 --> 00:43:53,875
Boys finished it perfectly,
job is done, don't worry, brother.

509
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,500
Run...run...run...

510
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,750
Run!

511
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:09,875
Problem would get solved clearly, right?

512
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:11,958
Sure, nothing will happen, brother.

513
00:45:12,542 --> 00:45:15,083
Nothing will go wrong, right?
- It'll not, brother.

514
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,542
As planned by Appukutty,

515
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:35,875
this incident increased Guna and
boys' anger on Councillor.

516
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:38,750
What mistake have we done?

517
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:42,417
We raised voice for our basic right.

518
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,542
Did we go against the govt.?

519
00:46:46,458 --> 00:46:48,167
Did we strip naked to protest?

520
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,958
Or did we hold some politician
by his collar?

521
00:46:53,292 --> 00:46:55,875
A man is waiting with weapon to kill us.

522
00:46:56,042 --> 00:46:57,375
Today the weapon was in his hand,

523
00:46:57,542 --> 00:46:59,167
how can anyone assure that
Guna wouldn't be the next victim?

524
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:01,208
We went to and raised voice
in Councillor's house, right?

525
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:02,208
He retaliated now.

526
00:47:02,417 --> 00:47:05,375
We mustn't leave it.
They'll not let us live here.

527
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:09,417
Brother, is a village it is considered as
wrong for us to talk about politics.

528
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:12,083
No use in fighting weapons.

529
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,542
We voted for them, right?

530
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,417
For voting them,
we've to save ourselves.

531
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:23,375
Hey anti-Indian, you escaped this time,
next time they'll finish you perfectly.

532
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:24,208
Beware!

533
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:27,750
Brother! Would they dare hack him?

534
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:31,208
Is he lady's finger or brinjal
for them to cut easily?

535
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:33,000
Entire village is stinking,

536
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,750
if anyone dares question it,
would they hack him?

537
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:37,750
Today the weapon almost killed him,

538
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:43,083
I pray to God that no one else
must become a victim to it.

539
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:47,875
My prayers for years has
saved you this time.

540
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:55,417
Why are you crying, father?

541
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:58,750
We women are there for him
as sisters and mothers.

542
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,500
Why are you crying?

543
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:29,417
Gomathi!

544
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:18,208
Losing Gomathi plunged Guna's life
into darkness of intoxication.

545
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:20,958
It shattered his life.

546
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:47,417
Get that waste fellow.

547
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:50,750
Come on, man.

548
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,875
You dumped trash and
ruined this village.

549
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:03,417
How many times we may warn,
won't you listen to us?

550
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,292
Will you keep on coming?

551
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:10,375
No one here may dare ask you but
I'll keep on asking to stop till end.

552
00:50:10,542 --> 00:50:11,958
What man?

553
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,875
As him to come,
I'll take on anyone it may be.

554
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:19,083
Isn't there anyone to stop you?

555
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:20,417
Hello sir!

556
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:23,750
Please don't create a scene
by getting drunk.

557
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:26,417
Sir, don't...
- Ask him to come immediately.

558
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:28,417
Ask him to come immediately.
- Okay, sir.

559
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:29,875
I'll wait here.

560
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:32,417
Did you ask him to come?

561
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:36,375
Tell him to come or else
I'll burn down the vehicle.

562
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:37,667
I'm telling you respectfully,
go away, please.

563
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:40,542
If sir comes here,
you'll be in trouble. Get going.

564
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:44,417
You mustn't speak now,
you asked him to come, right?

565
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:47,292
Let him come, I'll talk to him.

566
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:50,375
If I stand here...here he comes...

567
00:50:50,542 --> 00:50:52,208
He and his damn...

568
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:56,208
Sir is here, please go away silently.
- He's here, right? Keep quiet, man.

569
00:50:56,417 --> 00:50:58,083
He's here, right? Keep quiet, man.

570
00:50:58,292 --> 00:50:59,667
Please stand aside.

571
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:02,375
Welcome Councillor...come...come...

572
00:51:02,542 --> 00:51:05,167
Every village needs
a councillor like you.

573
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:11,542
Won't you show even little loyalty
to this village and it's people?

574
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,958
You've come here for his bribe.

575
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:21,375
No one may dare ask you but
I'll come to ask for the society.

576
00:51:21,542 --> 00:51:22,958
I'll stand on it till the end.

577
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:25,292
He's creating problem for
dumping waste here, sir.

578
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,417
Young blood is forcing him to rebel.

579
00:51:30,542 --> 00:51:34,083
Hey, shut and go away.
If not I'll thrash you.

580
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:35,750
Why are you talking to him, brother?

581
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:37,375
We'll finish him.
- Finish me?

582
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:41,750
Hey politicians!
Won't you spare even one home?

583
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:43,750
Why do you need so much money?

584
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:46,750
We voted for you hoping
for better life.

585
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:48,417
Traitors!

586
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,875
Councillor who was waiting
for an opportune time,

587
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:59,875
he decided to instill fear
in entire village by killing Guna.

588
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:12,750
Guna...Guna...
Hey Lenin! Come here.

589
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:16,000
What happened to you, Guna?
Get up! Who did this?

590
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:17,750
Get up, Guna.

591
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:20,500
Who is it, father?

592
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:21,500
Look at him, son.

593
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:23,542
Guna get up.
- Brother Guna!

594
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:26,083
Brother Guna...brother...

595
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:27,375
Brother Guna...

596
00:54:56,917 --> 00:54:59,250
I don't know how to console you.

597
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:04,250
Nobody expected it would
happen like this to Guna.

598
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:08,250
No one can fill his gap.

599
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:11,458
But how many more days
will you mourn for him?

600
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,667
Why don't you try to change yourself?

601
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:16,708
Even situations arise in life
when we've to miss people,

602
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:18,583
we've to accept the reality.

603
00:55:18,792 --> 00:55:21,667
I'm not any wiser to advice you.

604
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:25,250
But I can't bear to see my Lenin
in this condition.

605
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:26,583
Please.

606
00:55:26,792 --> 00:55:28,542
Try to change yourself.

607
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:41,917
Brother, why are you like this?

608
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:46,917
Guna's death is hurting me a lot.

609
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:54,042
We should've bumped him off,
but someone else killed Guna.

610
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:58,042
Though he may be our enemy,

611
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:03,042
when this village faces any problem,
he's the first guy to come out bravely.

612
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:07,167
I've saved it working hard, sir.

613
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:11,167
Sir...sir, I'll pay it.
Please sir...please...

614
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:16,833
No sir...please leave me, sir!

615
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:30,042
When financer took away my vehicle
for failing to pay installment,

616
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:33,667
Guna pledged his wife's jewels
to redeem it.

617
00:56:34,417 --> 00:56:36,333
How is he related to help me?

618
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:42,042
Even close relatives deny help
when we go seeking.

619
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,958
He's very good man.

620
00:56:45,417 --> 00:56:48,125
We should've helped him
when he was alive.

621
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:05,333
Isai, please come in.

622
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:07,917
No problem, I'll go now.
I'll come some other day.

623
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:09,458
I said come in.

624
00:57:18,917 --> 00:57:21,667
Father...father...

625
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:26,333
She's Isai Arasi.
- Greetings, uncle.

626
00:57:32,792 --> 00:57:33,667
Please sit down, dear.

627
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:38,458
Sit there.

628
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:52,667
Go, talk to him.

629
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:17,167
Sorry uncle, I had to meet you
without intimation.

630
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:23,542
No dear, infact I feel bad to
meet you in this situation.

631
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:26,042
What can we do?

632
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:28,958
Did we expect this to happen?

633
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:31,125
It was God's decision.

634
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:37,583
No uncle, Guna's death has
affected Lenin very much.

635
00:58:37,792 --> 00:58:39,583
He's very disturbed.

636
00:58:39,792 --> 00:58:45,042
Guna's death isn't just loss to Lenin,
it's a loss to entire village.

637
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:50,167
Look at that house, his wife died
and then he too died.

638
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:52,458
A home without inhabitants.

639
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:59,042
If this place faces any problem,
he'll be at the forefront to take on.

640
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:02,667
He talked about politics saying
we must fight for our rights.

641
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,458
But they killed him like a street dog.

642
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:11,333
I'm still to get over it.

643
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,333
May his soul rest in peace.

644
00:59:17,417 --> 00:59:19,542
Forget about that, you've come
to house for the first time,

645
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:20,542
what would you like to have, dear?

646
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:23,667
Oh no problem, uncle.
I'm getting late. I'll take leave.

647
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:31,583
Boys told me Lenin loves you after me.

648
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:35,333
I raised him without denying anything.

649
00:59:36,542 --> 00:59:39,250
I don't know how his mother would've
raised him if she was alive.

650
00:59:39,917 --> 00:59:42,667
You must look after him well after me.

651
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:45,042
Okay.

652
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:40,542
Child is crying, please see him.

653
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:42,917
Mosquito menace, father.
I'll check him.

654
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:46,167
You put the child out in open
and say mosquitoes.

655
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:47,583
Take him inside.

656
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:55,167
Stink and mosquitoes from dump yard,

657
01:00:55,417 --> 01:01:01,458
the area witnessed many
mysterious deaths.

658
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:05,042
A part of these deaths,

659
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:13,250
it didn't spare Arumugam who took loan
from usury for daughter's marriage.

660
01:01:25,625 --> 01:01:28,458
Oh no, my child will be hungry.

661
01:02:17,792 --> 01:02:20,042
People of Thannilangadu village decided,

662
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:23,250
to show their anger on politicians,

663
01:02:23,458 --> 01:02:26,375
laying siege of the road
with dead bodies,

664
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:28,042
decided to fight in protest!

665
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:40,042
Hey, stop!

666
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:42,708
How many times we warned you?

667
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:45,125
Would we face this situation
if you had been little reasonable?

668
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:49,333
How many lives!

669
01:02:49,917 --> 01:02:51,333
You played politics with it.

670
01:02:51,542 --> 01:02:54,167
They'll play politics for life
or death.

671
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:56,583
When they come seeking votes,
they'll bow and beg us,

672
01:02:56,792 --> 01:02:58,833
after winning, if we face any problem,

673
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:01,042
even if we fall at their feet,
they don't even care to see.

674
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:04,708
Why not spend rest of
our lives as usual?

675
01:03:04,917 --> 01:03:06,542
There are rules for discussion also.

676
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:08,583
I've informed higher authorities
about your problem.

677
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:09,875
I'll correct it.

678
01:03:10,042 --> 01:03:12,375
Who is higher authority?

679
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:15,708
Who gave permission to Kerala guys
to dump wastage here?

680
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,667
Your higher authority gave
the permission, right?

681
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:20,917
It's not the fault of
Kerala people but you.

682
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:23,542
Power of rule is in you
politicians' hands.

683
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:25,542
Are his lorries crossing check post
without your permission?

684
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:29,708
You're sucking our blood for
the currency notes he gives.

685
01:03:29,917 --> 01:03:33,458
Even weapons have mercy!

686
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:40,375
Your family mustn't face the
fate of these dead.

687
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,667
At least for that take action on them.

688
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:44,542
Let this pain go away with us.

689
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:46,708
How many more deaths
would stop your politics?

690
01:03:46,917 --> 01:03:49,542
You don't even consider
as humans, right?

691
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:53,333
You can't give us basic health services,
how can you console us?

692
01:03:54,667 --> 01:04:00,333
So many people died because of slaughter
house and medical waste dumped by Kerala.

693
01:04:00,542 --> 01:04:04,708
We're living in fear of death without
knowing why we're dying and for what!

694
01:04:04,917 --> 01:04:06,375
We voted for you, right?

695
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:10,042
That's why we're on streets
losing many in family.

696
01:04:10,792 --> 01:04:15,542
Bloody sinners, mother, child and
head of family have died like orphans.

697
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:17,542
You killed them unjustly.

698
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:20,542
If you spare us alive,
we'll vote again.

699
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:23,375
If you kill us too,
who would vote for you?

700
01:04:23,542 --> 01:04:25,542
Bloody killers!

701
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:30,167
At least spare us to vote for you.
I beg you, sir.

702
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:32,542
Grandma, calm down.
- Please don't cry, sister.

703
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:34,917
Solve the problem in a week.

704
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:38,250
If not we'll spread message to entire
Tamil Nadu through Facebook, Whatsapp,

705
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,250
and fight for our rights.

706
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:43,458
Whether we support govt.
or rebel against it,

707
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:45,708
it's in your hands, who rule over us.
Beware!

708
01:04:45,917 --> 01:04:50,333
Enough of voting for you
and bowing before you.

709
01:04:50,542 --> 01:04:52,542
Please allow us to live in peace,
that's enough for us.

710
01:04:57,708 --> 01:05:00,542
What Sivam? It seems you're
sniffing for money here.

711
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:01,708
Nothing like that, brother.

712
01:05:01,917 --> 01:05:04,250
My enemy has spread this news, brother.

713
01:05:04,917 --> 01:05:11,375
The day people realize we're playing
politics with all their problems,

714
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:13,167
that'll be the end of our political life.

715
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:18,833
Politicians who ruled before us played
politics with basic elements also.

716
01:05:19,042 --> 01:05:23,542
If people realize we too are similar,
it doesn't augur well for us, Sivam.

717
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:27,042
Don't play politics in wastage dumping,

718
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:31,042
try to be loyal to the people
who had voted for you. Go!

719
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:55,250
Sister, please stop.

720
01:05:57,667 --> 01:05:58,708
Where are you going, sister?

721
01:05:58,917 --> 01:06:00,333
What happened, sister?

722
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,042
Where are you going?

723
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:07,542
Instead of dying with disease here,
better to live elsewhere peacefully.

724
01:06:07,708 --> 01:06:08,708
What's this, sister?

725
01:06:08,917 --> 01:06:14,833
I've lost confidence after seeing
an elderly man's body on road.

726
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:27,542
To protect future and this kid,
we'll go away to some other place.

727
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:29,917
Why are you talking so dejectedly?

728
01:06:31,417 --> 01:06:34,333
Your roots are here but
want to go away from here.

729
01:06:35,917 --> 01:06:37,667
We're here for you, sister.

730
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:42,667
We went against Councillor
and MLA for your sake, sister.

731
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:47,375
Then, what respect do we've
for our native place?

732
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:48,708
Sister, please think over.

733
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:52,333
How can you disown native place
and go away, sister?

734
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:56,250
Let's fight, this is your land.
How can walk away from it?

735
01:06:58,917 --> 01:07:00,917
Don't go sister, we're there for you.

736
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:03,542
Come, let's go.
- Sister, one minute please.

737
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:04,667
Sister!

738
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:16,042
Lenin, what can you do
if they decide to go?

739
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:20,250
Some times life's situation decides!

740
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:23,042
You come...come.

741
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:24,667
Come I say!

742
01:07:27,542 --> 01:07:28,333
Come in.

743
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:31,458
Father!

744
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:36,250
Father!

745
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:41,667
Father!

746
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:44,042
Father!

747
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:32,333
Father...

748
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:36,333
Father...

749
01:08:37,917 --> 01:08:40,042
What happened, Lenin?

750
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:45,333
Isai, look at him...

751
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:46,333
Father!

752
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:53,125
Father...father...father...

753
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:17,542
Father, talk to me once...

754
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:21,542
Father, look at me once...

755
01:09:21,708 --> 01:09:26,708
What death promises always gives it...

756
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:31,833
What life promises never gives it...

757
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:37,167
Come back alive again, father...

758
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:42,250
Give me back my smile, father...

759
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:47,042
Father, talk to me once...

760
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:10,042
You fathered me...

761
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:13,542
You were my mother also till now...

762
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:18,708
I became a beast...
You made me a human again...

763
01:10:18,917 --> 01:10:23,917
My world too died along with you...

764
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:29,458
Your last words would kill me...

765
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:31,667
Father...

766
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:43,042
Father, I'm hungry.

767
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:57,250
Do whatever makes you happy!

768
01:10:57,542 --> 01:10:59,583
But don't become a slave
to that happiness.

769
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:19,542
Those who commit mistakes
are not bad people.

770
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:23,250
But when a good man commits it,
he becomes a bad man.

771
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:30,042
I'm confident my son will
not commit mistakes.

772
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:37,833
I've raised my son as a good man
and God's child.

773
01:11:38,042 --> 01:11:43,125
Home is my father...

774
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:48,333
Word of love is my father...

775
01:11:48,542 --> 01:11:53,583
I'm a beast, father...

776
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:58,833
You're God, father...

777
01:11:59,042 --> 01:12:02,542
Father, talk to me once...

778
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:06,542
Father, look at me once...

779
01:12:06,708 --> 01:12:11,708
What death promises always gives it...

780
01:12:11,917 --> 01:12:17,042
What life promises never gives it...

781
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:22,542
Come back alive again, father...

782
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:29,042
Give me back my smile, father...

783
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:32,333
Buddy, look at me.

784
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:38,583
We feel very bad to see you
in this condition.

785
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:44,042
Time and situations
keep on rotating in circle.

786
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:47,458
We must just follow it.

787
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:51,667
I don't have age or
experience to advice you.

788
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:03,333
Come, buddy.

789
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:11,042
Take 4 idlies.
- Brother, two omelettes.

790
01:13:13,917 --> 01:13:15,542
Hey, pull over the bike.

791
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:17,917
Why, buddy? Come on, tell me.

792
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,250
Order two full bottles.

793
01:13:21,583 --> 01:13:23,458
Take it, man.
- Take it, sir.

794
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:40,667
Sir, party is coming angrily.

795
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,250
Okay, let him come.

796
01:13:50,917 --> 01:13:52,333
Come, brother.

797
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:55,250
Life always gives us sudden
unexpected shocks.

798
01:13:55,458 --> 01:13:57,458
We must get over it.

799
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,792
What to do now?

800
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:03,083
Come, let's go.

801
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:10,083
Lenin's anger created a new problem.

802
01:15:42,542 --> 01:15:45,125
Bloody! What do you think of yourself?
- Brother, don't hit me.

803
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,792
He did it unwittingly, brother.

804
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,875
What bloody unwittingly?

805
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:52,250
Murder!

806
01:15:53,792 --> 01:15:55,000
That too a police man!

807
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:56,792
Would they leave us so easily?

808
01:15:57,667 --> 01:16:01,875
Oh no, gone! Everything is gone.
They'll not let us live here.

809
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:04,083
We're ordinary people.

810
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:08,125
Food problem, job problem,
home problem.

811
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:10,958
We're daily wage earners who
struggle every day for livelihood.

812
01:16:11,208 --> 01:16:13,750
Infact we've to wage a war
everyday to keep us alive.

813
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,458
What's the use of talking now, brother?

814
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:17,958
Let bygones be bygones.

815
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:20,083
Let's think about what has to be done!

816
01:16:29,958 --> 01:16:30,792
Brother!

817
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:35,458
Buddy, don't cry.

818
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:38,958
We're there for you.
Would we let you down?

819
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:40,875
Brother, look at him.

820
01:16:41,208 --> 01:16:42,458
You tell him, brother.

821
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:43,750
Don't think too much, brother.

822
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,917
Who else is there for him
other than we, brother.

823
01:17:19,292 --> 01:17:21,000
Come in, Suresh.
- Come in, Salim.

824
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,083
I've informed the matter to Appukutty.

825
01:17:26,292 --> 01:17:28,833
He's waiting in auto near
Municipal office.

826
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:33,125
It's safe for Lenin to stay
there for tonight.

827
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:40,833
What are you saying, Salim?
We're at loggerheads with each other.

828
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,292
What if he betrays the boy as revenge?

829
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:48,083
Did he kill any ordinary man?

830
01:17:48,417 --> 01:17:49,208
Police officer.

831
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,208
Kamarasu, I'm telling for our good only.

832
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:55,333
Whatever it may be,
Appukutty is from our villge.

833
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:56,875
Though he may have
betrayed us many times,

834
01:17:57,083 --> 01:18:00,417
won't there be a little loyalty
hidden deep inside his heart?

835
01:18:02,417 --> 01:18:05,500
We can't live in exile discarding
everyone as traitor or enemy.

836
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:09,708
Lenin is Christian,
Suresh is Hindu,

837
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:11,208
I'm a Muslim,

838
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:14,000
did we meet here at mid-night
for religion or caste?

839
01:18:14,208 --> 01:18:18,542
He has a problem.
That's why we're standing united.

840
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:20,500
Love has brought us together.

841
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:25,500
Man came into this world first,
not caste or religion.

842
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:27,333
Kamarasu, think about what is to be done.

843
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:29,500
We must do something by morning.

844
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:32,083
Okay Salim, check and inform on phone.

845
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:41,833
Suresh, go carefully.
Police are on rounds.

846
01:18:52,667 --> 01:18:54,208
Why did you do like this?

847
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:58,208
Already there are many
problems in village.

848
01:18:58,417 --> 01:18:59,500
You added one more.

849
01:19:00,542 --> 01:19:04,625
Brother, nobody expected
he would do like this.

850
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:07,000
Brother, forget about the past.

851
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:09,667
Brother, you must get him
out of this problem.

852
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:13,208
Why are you insisting on it?
He's like my younger brother.

853
01:19:13,792 --> 01:19:14,667
I'll see it.

854
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,542
For whom should I live now, brother?

855
01:19:20,083 --> 01:19:22,625
Our Guna, what was his crime?

856
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:28,000
He fought for the rights of people.

857
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:30,000
Ruling class didn't like it.

858
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:31,292
How can they like it?

859
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:33,667
Govt. here worries about
maintaining 300 feet statue,

860
01:19:33,875 --> 01:19:37,333
never cares to get a ladder
to douse fire at 30 feet,

861
01:19:37,542 --> 01:19:38,625
that's how our Govts. work here!

862
01:19:38,792 --> 01:19:40,500
My Guna didn't die, brother.

863
01:19:40,667 --> 01:19:44,500
He's here only,
I'll do what he wanted to do.

864
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:49,875
Lenin, if we stand against power,
it'll ruin us.

865
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:51,667
We must think and
talk about politics.

866
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:54,875
Our blood is young.
The heat mustn't cool down.

867
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:57,208
Got it? Let's think over it.

868
01:19:57,417 --> 01:20:01,125
Brother, you didn't kill ordinary man.
Police officer.

869
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:03,625
That's more than enough
to put us in jail for life.

870
01:20:04,417 --> 01:20:05,500
First be safe for tonight.

871
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:09,292
We can think about future tomorrow.
Got it?

872
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:27,625
Why are you crying?

873
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:35,208
I asked you a question, right?

874
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:39,875
Why did you do like this?

875
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:43,208
Will you please stop talking about it?

876
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:00,417
Let's go to some other place.

877
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:04,083
Leaving this village and everything
behind to some place peacefully.

878
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:07,500
Then...don't bother about whatever
may happen to anyone here.

879
01:21:09,667 --> 01:21:11,292
You must live peacefully,
that's what you want, right?

880
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:16,417
I don't need you.

881
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:22,792
My village, my land and my people.

882
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,208
Friendship is important to me.

883
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:27,875
Then, you don't want me, right?

884
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:30,417
Answer me, I asked you
a question, right?

885
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:43,625
Okay, I'm going.
- Go.

886
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:45,417
Go away.

887
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:47,667
Don't you ever come back again.

888
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:49,417
Go.

889
01:21:51,667 --> 01:21:52,667
Go away.

890
01:21:53,083 --> 01:22:03,542
Is it mistake of love or eyes?

891
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:13,000
Is it heart's mistake that
never forgets anything?

892
01:22:14,208 --> 01:22:17,292
My love...

893
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:23,000
I'm living in fire...

894
01:22:23,208 --> 01:22:29,500
Why are you living in hatred?

895
01:22:40,542 --> 01:22:45,625
Love pain in heart is sweet...

896
01:22:45,792 --> 01:22:51,333
My missing eyes are on fire...

897
01:22:51,542 --> 01:23:01,500
I've become feast to duty...
But I'm hungry for love...

898
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:12,083
I've become feast to duty...
But I'm hungry for love...

899
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:33,625
Love is beyond body,
a deep intense feeling of affection...

900
01:23:33,792 --> 01:23:39,125
My heart is searching
for life away from body...

901
01:23:39,333 --> 01:23:41,667
What you say is true, my love...

902
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:44,542
I second what you say...

903
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:49,667
Call of duty is beyond love...

904
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:54,667
Eyes are oozing love
instead of tears...

905
01:23:54,875 --> 01:24:00,125
I don't want your shadow...
I don't want your eyes...

906
01:24:00,333 --> 01:24:03,500
Your voice is enough...
- Enough...enough...

907
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:06,667
Don't torture teasing me......

908
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:11,500
O dear, don't kill me with your love...

909
01:24:11,667 --> 01:24:14,000
Don't kill me...don't kill me...

910
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:19,500
Don't torture teasing me......

911
01:24:19,667 --> 01:24:24,292
O dear, don't kill me
with your love...

912
01:24:24,583 --> 01:24:28,083
Love pain in my heart...

913
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:53,667
Your sensitive soft touches...
romance that touched you...

914
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:59,000
Those livid moments are
still fresh in my heart...

915
01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:04,500
Yesterday's lilting songs...
gentle flowery rain...

916
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:09,542
They are ever fresh in my heart...

917
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:14,625
I'm no more what I used to be...

918
01:25:14,792 --> 01:25:23,500
I'm you...you're me...
Where's separation for us?

919
01:25:23,667 --> 01:25:28,667
Don't say this and
go away from me...

920
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:33,542
Don't kill me staying away...

921
01:25:34,208 --> 01:25:37,333
Don't say this and
go away from me...

922
01:25:37,542 --> 01:25:44,208
Don't kill me staying away...

923
01:25:44,542 --> 01:25:49,667
Love pain in heart is sweet...

924
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:55,500
My missing eyes are on fire...

925
01:25:55,667 --> 01:26:06,000
I've become feast to duty...
But I'm hungry for love...

926
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:18,417
I've become feast to duty...
But I'm hungry for love...

927
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:47,083
Brother Sagayam!

928
01:26:49,667 --> 01:26:52,875
I'm thinking about surrendering
him in station.

929
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:55,542
He killed a police officer.

930
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:58,417
It's risky to surrender with police.

931
01:27:04,542 --> 01:27:07,417
Can we surrender him in court with AB?

932
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:13,208
Sagayam, you must save him
at any cost.

933
01:27:13,875 --> 01:27:17,667
You must free him from this problem.

934
01:27:18,417 --> 01:27:21,292
What's this?
Why are you requesting, bhai?

935
01:27:21,792 --> 01:27:23,208
I'm here to serve you.

936
01:27:24,208 --> 01:27:27,417
What he did is crime,
but situation forced it on him.

937
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:31,625
Do one thing, come to
court tomorrow morning.

938
01:27:31,792 --> 01:27:33,000
Let's surrender him.

939
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:36,208
I'll keep the details ready.

940
01:27:36,667 --> 01:27:37,500
Okay, bhai?

941
01:27:37,667 --> 01:27:39,292
I'm leaving trusting you.

942
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:02,208
Lenin!

943
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:06,417
What's it, son?

944
01:28:08,667 --> 01:28:10,000
Why are you so scared?

945
01:28:13,583 --> 01:28:15,292
Father is with you only, son.

946
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,000
Why are you scared, son?

947
01:28:19,583 --> 01:28:21,917
Father...father...

948
01:28:22,167 --> 01:28:23,625
Those who commit crimes must be afraid.

949
01:28:25,417 --> 01:28:30,208
Son, everything will be fine.

950
01:28:31,667 --> 01:28:35,292
I've raised my son as good man
and God's child.

951
01:28:37,292 --> 01:28:38,542
Truth is on your side.

952
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,500
No need to fear anyone.

953
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,083
No need to fear anyone.

954
01:28:44,542 --> 01:28:46,083
Truth is on your side.

955
01:29:08,417 --> 01:29:10,083
Come brother Sagayam.
- Greetings.

956
01:29:10,667 --> 01:29:13,875
Greetings, bhai.
- Everything will be fine, right brother?

957
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:17,208
Don't worry, bhai.
I've prepared papers perfectly.

958
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:19,083
I'll come back after
meeting magistrate.

959
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:20,625
Let's hope for the best.

960
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:22,292
Come, Selvam.

961
01:29:44,792 --> 01:29:47,292
Why are you indifferent, Sagayam?

962
01:29:47,792 --> 01:29:49,083
What happened, brother?

963
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,875
Bhai, our expectations turned
topsy-turvy here.

964
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:56,333
I planned for a surrender here.

965
01:29:56,542 --> 01:29:59,625
But they surrendered another
man as accused.

966
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,292
I think some VIP is behind
Lenin's case, bhai.

967
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,208
What are you saying, brother?

968
01:30:14,417 --> 01:30:16,083
We've to be very careful from now.

969
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:19,208
Lenin, be careful.

970
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:24,000
Bhai, keep Lenin safe for
next two days.

971
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:31,542
Brother, no more problems.

972
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:33,292
All your problems got solved amicably.

973
01:30:33,542 --> 01:30:38,333
Salim, I've made a vow to carry
Karagam if everything goes on fine.

974
01:30:38,542 --> 01:30:39,667
Goddess Mother will take
care of everything.

975
01:30:39,875 --> 01:30:41,667
Don't worry, be happy.

976
01:30:41,875 --> 01:30:44,667
Let's rock tomorrow's
festival in temple.

977
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:52,500
Cheating...cheating...cheating...

978
01:30:52,667 --> 01:30:54,542
Look, how well he cheated them...

979
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:57,000
Stealing from others to feed
one's own child...

980
01:30:57,208 --> 01:30:58,500
Leaving other children
in dire straits...

981
01:30:58,667 --> 01:31:00,083
Cheating...

982
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:06,625
Stealing 1000s of crores and
paying Rs.1000 for a vote...

983
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:08,667
Left the state thirsting for water...

984
01:31:08,875 --> 01:31:10,083
Cheating...

985
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,667
Price rise...cheating...

986
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:15,875
Farmers....cheating...

987
01:31:16,083 --> 01:31:17,125
Poor...cheating...

988
01:31:17,375 --> 01:31:18,500
Caste clashes...cheating...

989
01:31:18,667 --> 01:31:21,208
Cheating everyone to flourish...

990
01:31:27,875 --> 01:31:36,208
Cheating...cheating...cheating...

991
01:31:47,667 --> 01:31:49,292
Hey mister...

992
01:31:51,375 --> 01:31:53,500
Dare come seeking votes now...

993
01:31:53,667 --> 01:31:56,000
Dare watching this film...

994
01:31:56,208 --> 01:32:00,667
Don't try to act smart with us...
Times are changing, don't go overboard...

995
01:32:00,875 --> 01:32:05,333
Don't you dare enter our streets...
Don't celebrate, you can't win...

996
01:32:05,583 --> 01:32:07,333
Bloody rascal...

997
01:32:07,542 --> 01:32:10,125
Don't cheat us...

998
01:32:10,333 --> 01:32:19,333
Cheating...cheating...O cheating....

999
01:32:19,542 --> 01:32:21,500
Feelings?
I'm asking, are you feeling bad?

1000
01:32:21,667 --> 01:32:23,875
I'm feeling bad, come on, play!

1001
01:32:24,667 --> 01:32:31,500
Cheating...cheating...cheating....

1002
01:32:31,667 --> 01:32:33,500
Here he comes to cheat you...

1003
01:32:33,667 --> 01:32:36,875
Here he comes to cheat you...

1004
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:43,875
Here he comes to cheat you...

1005
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,208
Gone...done...

1006
01:32:57,333 --> 01:32:59,500
Is this enough or you want more?

1007
01:32:59,667 --> 01:33:01,792
Is this enough or you want more?

1008
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,125
Is this enough or you want more?

1009
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:06,625
Hey!

1010
01:34:07,667 --> 01:34:09,208
Are boys ready?

1011
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:13,208
Plan mustn't fail at any cost.

1012
01:34:29,292 --> 01:34:33,000
Isai...Isai...

1013
01:34:53,208 --> 01:34:54,167
Come.

1014
01:34:54,667 --> 01:34:56,583
When did you come?
- Just now.

1015
01:35:15,583 --> 01:35:17,208
Hey, leader is here, come quickly.

1016
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:20,208
Greetings...greetings.

1017
01:35:20,667 --> 01:35:21,583
Greetings.

1018
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:22,625
Greetings, madam.

1019
01:35:24,875 --> 01:35:25,667
Welcome Durai!

1020
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:26,667
Welcome...
- Greetings, Durai.

1021
01:35:26,875 --> 01:35:28,208
Hey, give me that.

1022
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,042
Greetings, brother.

1023
01:35:30,292 --> 01:35:32,500
I heard you're doing good
for the village.

1024
01:35:32,667 --> 01:35:34,667
I'm very happy, leader.
- Put it.

1025
01:35:34,875 --> 01:35:36,875
Your coming is indeed a
great honour for this festival.

1026
01:35:37,083 --> 01:35:38,500
I'm very happy.

1027
01:35:38,667 --> 01:35:40,583
Greetings leader.
- Come, let's go.

1028
01:35:46,667 --> 01:35:48,000
Move...move...
- Greetings.

1029
01:35:48,208 --> 01:35:50,083
Move...move...move...

1030
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,292
Honour leader with garland.

1031
01:38:38,875 --> 01:38:43,292
Hey run...this side...go quickly...

1032
01:40:00,083 --> 01:40:01,875
What happened, buddy?

1033
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:08,000
Nothing!

1034
01:40:09,375 --> 01:40:10,875
It was all handiwork of Councillor.

1035
01:40:11,083 --> 01:40:12,792
We mustn't spare him, buddy.
Come.

1036
01:40:18,667 --> 01:40:20,083
Come, let's go.

1037
01:40:48,667 --> 01:40:50,625
Hey Councillor! Come out, man!

1038
01:40:54,583 --> 01:40:55,875
Hey come out , man!

1039
01:41:39,417 --> 01:41:40,875
Kamarasu!

1040
01:41:42,583 --> 01:41:46,000
Buddy...buddy...

1041
01:41:54,667 --> 01:41:58,083
Buddy...forgive me..

1042
01:42:03,542 --> 01:42:04,583
Leave me.

1043
01:42:44,583 --> 01:42:47,667
Tell me, why are you after me?

1044
01:42:47,875 --> 01:42:51,667
No sir, I want to talk to him.

1045
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:54,083
No problem, tell me, whatever it is.

1046
01:42:54,292 --> 01:42:56,667
No sir, for earlier medical camp,

1047
01:42:56,875 --> 01:43:01,167
people agreed to give blood samples
only after he talked to them.

1048
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:04,417
So, I need to talk to him, sir.

1049
01:43:05,792 --> 01:43:09,500
We both are close friends,
tell me, whatever it may be.

1050
01:43:09,667 --> 01:43:10,875
I'll take care of everything.

1051
01:43:11,667 --> 01:43:15,792
Sir, in the blood samples
collected in your village,

1052
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,292
30% of them have been
infected with virus, sir.

1053
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:35,583
What are you saying?

1054
01:43:36,625 --> 01:43:42,583
Councillor of that village bribed
doctors to hide this fact, sir.

1055
01:43:48,333 --> 01:43:51,000
All the affected need
to be treated, sir.

1056
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:54,875
Don't know who else is affected
with virus in this village?

1057
01:43:55,083 --> 01:43:57,208
We must take blood samples immediately.

1058
01:43:57,417 --> 01:44:01,208
I don't know how serious
this problem is!

1059
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:05,417
But I fear something big
is about to happen.

1060
01:44:08,083 --> 01:44:15,208
Why I felt like telling you is, one of
the victim was just a 3 year old child.

1061
01:44:35,875 --> 01:44:43,583
You must make it a big issue with
Govt. circles and find a solution.

1062
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:46,000
There's no other way for it, sir.

1063
01:44:47,542 --> 01:44:50,208
Locals never realize the
power of local God.

1064
01:44:59,667 --> 01:45:06,000
Sir, if we stand by friend like Karna,
we'll be in streets for a morsel of food.

1065
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,875
I must live...live happily.

1066
01:45:12,667 --> 01:45:14,292
Just tell me, what should I do?

1067
01:45:18,792 --> 01:45:21,292
Using avarice of Kamarasu,

1068
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:26,292
Councillor ensured no one ever
dared to take on politicians.

1069
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:22,292
Betrayal of Kamarasu shows us that
we can never ever take on politicians.

1070
01:48:22,667 --> 01:48:34,208
