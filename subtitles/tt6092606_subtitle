1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The film you are about to see
was born under the sound of the stars.

2
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:54,178
For those who have wronged us
and are no longer here

3
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:59,808
The film you just saw was based

4
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:03,588
on true events in France,
in the dead of winter 1996

5
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:08,772
from an investigation led by Serge Catoire.

6
00:02:53,394 --> 00:02:54,938
Being is a fleeting illusion

7
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:57,148
What does dance represent to you?

8
00:02:57,565 --> 00:02:58,983
It's everything.

9
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:02,611
Dancing's everything to me.

10
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:05,029
It's all I have.

11
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,907
If you couldn't dance,
what would you do?

12
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:11,910
Suicide.

13
00:03:12,244 --> 00:03:16,164
When on a stage and dancing,

14
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:19,917
you feel free. No boundaries and judgment

15
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:22,794
there is just us, our body, our feeling

16
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:24,671
I find marijuana

17
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:28,133
is a great muscle relaxant.

18
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:30,801
When you feel dance differently,

19
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:32,762
it makes you more sensitive,

20
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:38,307
certain muscles and certain body sensations.

21
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:41,185
When I dance, I can be someone else

22
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:43,396
I could not be elsewhere.

23
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:44,730
That's it.

24
00:03:45,313 --> 00:03:46,481
Alright.

25
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:48,733
Does your family support you?

26
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,861
Yes.
My mother, my father, and all.

27
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:54,196
- Do they know you dance?
- Yes.

28
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:56,657
- Do they come see you dance?
- No.

29
00:03:57,073 --> 00:03:58,533
I'd rather they didn't.

30
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,869
- What would they say?
- They'd be a bit shocked.

31
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:06,165
Are you willing to
do anything to succeed?

32
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,000
What do you mean?

33
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,335
Would you...

34
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:15,839
Well, in a professional environment...

35
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:19,009
you want to please...

36
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,179
I'd do anything.

37
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,763
Meaning what?

38
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,931
Anything.

39
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:27,683
I don't know what you might ask,

40
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:32,145
but I'm motivated and it's a big break

41
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:35,315
to work with a choreographer like you.

42
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:39,944
This could greatly help my development.

43
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,903
I'm ready for anything.

44
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,864
- So I can ask anything from you?
- Anything.

45
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:46,907
My worst nightmare?

46
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:50,368
To find myself alone.

47
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:53,538
With nothing and no one around me.
Alone.

48
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:56,415
Do you have a motto?

49
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,127
"What doesn't kill me, makes me stronger."

50
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:02,295
Do you believe in heaven?

51
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:03,463
Yes.

52
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:05,798
Why?

53
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:08,468
Because I want to believe in it.

54
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:10,469
And what's heaven like?

55
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:12,471
Everything's right.

56
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:14,514
How do you mean?

57
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:19,685
Only beauty. No problems.
No chaos over there.

58
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,395
I am from Berlin,

59
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:25,523
but I'm happy to leave.

60
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,194
It became too much.
The art scene there is too much

61
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:34,323
I really want to do what I love,

62
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,742
without... being fucked up.

63
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:42,705
There's a lot of drugs in Berlin.
It's too much.

64
00:05:43,122 --> 00:05:47,000
My ex-roommate,
I don't talk to him anymore...

65
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:51,379
Before I moved out,
he started to take acid in his eyes.

66
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:53,088
Like actual drops.

67
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,511
So I decided to get away
from all that, because...

68
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:03,014
I don't want to
end up like Christiane F.

69
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,683
I like to blow off steam, and...

70
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,813
I have my own secret garden...

71
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:17,234
I like to visit it during parties.

72
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:20,487
I tried a rail of coke one time.

73
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:25,283
You asked me to be honest, so...

74
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:28,035
Yes, I tried it with a girlfriend.

75
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:30,328
My worst nightmare?

76
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:37,209
I'm very afraid of the dark.

77
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:39,044
Really intensely.

78
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:41,963
When you do things differently,

79
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,340
either it works or it doesn't.

80
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:48,218
In my experience it...

81
00:06:48,635 --> 00:06:50,470
often didn't work out.

82
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:53,306
I jump right in.

83
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:57,726
If there's a problem, I'll fix it
and move right along.

84
00:06:58,144 --> 00:06:59,895
What was the worst thing you did

85
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:01,354
to a guy in a fight?

86
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,482
I smashed his face.

87
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:07,276
He broke two teeth.

88
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:11,780
A cut on his forehead.
He passed out.

89
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:13,824
He was in a coma for two days.

90
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,202
- Are you sorry?
- Not really. That's life.

91
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:20,580
- Do you take drugs?
- No, no, never.

92
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:24,541
No drugs.
I'm more into women.

93
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:27,036
What do you think
about the other dancers?

94
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:28,627
There's a nice mix.

95
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:30,879
It looks promising.

96
00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:32,673
How do you mean?

97
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,050
Well, the chicks are good-looking.

98
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:39,512
- Your cousin is your partner in crime?
- Yeah, we cruise chicks together.

99
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:41,055
Guys too?

100
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:42,681
Guys, well...

101
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:48,103
With guys... that depends.

102
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:53,148
I haven't worked with gays.

103
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:55,525
I'm a bit nervous, but...

104
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,277
it's not a problem.

105
00:07:57,861 --> 00:08:00,238
I'm waiting for that first connection.

106
00:08:00,404 --> 00:08:04,032
I've heard stories,
but I want to see for myself.

107
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,245
Sure, it makes me a little nervous

108
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:11,122
But I like the thrill of the unknown

109
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:14,291
As siblings we're close, obviously.

110
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:18,754
With dance we have something in common,

111
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:22,090
which... brings us closer.

112
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:26,176
We'll tour France and the U.S.
How do you like that?

113
00:08:26,343 --> 00:08:28,720
I've been to New York before, so...

114
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:31,640
Well, that's awesome!

115
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:35,184
- We've never been to the U.S. together.
- Sure, but I've been to New York.

116
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:36,894
Really? With who?

117
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,480
You have to see the U.S.

118
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:44,191
Especially for black culture, it's awesome.

119
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:45,860
America?

120
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:50,030
America... It's heaven on earth.

121
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,616
- Have you been before?
- Never.

122
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,160
I come from a hell.

123
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:58,412
Where is hell?

124
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:02,582
We're lucky in France, with support

125
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:05,668
dance is at an incredibly high level.

126
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:09,505
It'd be interesting
to bring it to other countries,

127
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:14,426
like America or other places
that are at a lower level, I think.

128
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:17,762
France really supports us.

129
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:22,015
With its radiant culture and music

130
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:25,060
it really gives us opportunities

131
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:29,146
to develop and do top-level work

132
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:31,648
with a French stamp on it.

133
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:21,190
Present: A Proudly French Film

134
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,942
God is with us!

135
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:24,322
Now let the party begin!

136
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:32,704
I'm in love with your kid!

137
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:35,498
- That's my Tito.
- He's great. May I dance with him?

138
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:38,126
Sure, go ahead.
I made sangria.

139
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:39,793
- Thank you.
- See you later.

140
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,380
So what did you think?

141
00:15:43,546 --> 00:15:47,133
Fantastic! Fantastic!
Just the two girls in the middle who...

142
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:51,553
I know... I'll work with them.
We need some fun now, everyone's tired.

143
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,016
Sure, it's hard
but for 3 days work, it's fantastic!

144
00:15:56,182 --> 00:15:59,184
- Who you talking about?
- You. Come talk with me.

145
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:07,609
C'mon David!

146
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:09,944
You do this every time!

147
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:26,416
- Sangria?
- I don't drink.

148
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,418
- Oh, of course.
- You knew that.

149
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:30,378
It's cool, that's cool.

150
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:35,299
- A drink?
- No thank you.

151
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:37,551
- Are you sure?
- I don't feel well.

152
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,641
Here.

153
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:47,475
Thank you.

154
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:56,317
What is it? What do you want?

155
00:16:57,359 --> 00:17:00,361
I told you to stop.
Remember yesterday? Please.

156
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:02,572
- No one sees us.
- Are you kidding me?

157
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:06,701
- Are you happy? What do you want?
- Just to be with you.

158
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:10,495
- When can I see you?
- You see me now. Go dance.

159
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:19,336
You! You!

160
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:23,047
That solo, every single time, it's so good!

161
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:24,215
Thank you.

162
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:26,425
- You're so good.
- You liked it?

163
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:31,054
I couldn't be happier.
Thank you guys, you're amazing.

164
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:32,222
You...

165
00:17:32,388 --> 00:17:35,933
- Sorry. - It's OK.
Your attitude is perfect.

166
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:39,644
- There's something between you and Omar.
- What are you talking about?

167
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:43,022
- Tough practice, eh?
- Yeah.

168
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:45,524
- I'm watching you. Be careful.
- Yeah, yeah.

169
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,992
Hey, daddy, sound is great!

170
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,828
- Not drinking?
- No.

171
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,872
- Try with her.
- I don't drink, you know that.

172
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,459
- Quit sulking.
- I'm not sulking, I'm just tired.

173
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:09,462
- Quit sulking!
- I'm not sulking! I'm just tired!

174
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:11,213
You're always tired!

175
00:18:13,632 --> 00:18:15,842
- Help me down?
- Come on down.

176
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:23,932
I made sangria for the dancers.

177
00:18:24,432 --> 00:18:28,145
It's alcohol, it's not good for you.
This is not juice, alright?

178
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:29,937
Leave him be!

179
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:32,564
Come, dance with me, Tito!

180
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:38,319
Dance with me!

181
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,424
Daddy, turn it up please!

182
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,008
And how was it?

183
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:07,428
It was great!
As always.

184
00:19:18,145 --> 00:19:19,688
What are you up to?

185
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:23,775
Remember our dance?

186
00:19:27,903 --> 00:19:31,114
This way, then like this...

187
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:34,283
Then like that.

188
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:36,577
Good! Do I get a hug?

189
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:39,705
One more?

190
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:42,248
One more?

191
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,253
Now you get tickled!

192
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,090
Where's your mom?

193
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:32,708
I'm getting changed.

194
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:48,138
- What was that before?
- What?

195
00:20:48,304 --> 00:20:50,723
- With your brother?
- That's how Taylor is.

196
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,684
- Don't push him.
- He was pushing me!

197
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:25,127
- You and me.
- No.

198
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,633
- Gross. Why are you drinking that?
- Give it here then.

199
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:36,387
David!

200
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:41,808
Selva... What's happening?

201
00:21:50,316 --> 00:21:52,400
I'm worried for the kid.

202
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:55,945
Why? He went to bed, he's fine.

203
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:57,572
Is everything OK?

204
00:21:58,573 --> 00:22:00,199
Not a care in the world.

205
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,796
It's not a good environment for a child.

206
00:22:18,673 --> 00:22:20,299
Why bring that up?

207
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:24,553
He's very well.
He's happy, he's well raised.

208
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,471
No.

209
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:30,683
Yes, he's a good kid.
She was right not to abort.

210
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:37,313
The sangria is amazing!
Pure awesome!

211
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,650
Did you ever have an abortion?

212
00:22:47,197 --> 00:22:49,031
It's good to have a choice.

213
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:52,326
Don't you think?

214
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,622
Being born is a unique opportunity

215
00:22:56,997 --> 00:22:59,374
You know mommy used to dance?

216
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,335
She danced. When I look at you,
I see myself when I was little.

217
00:23:03,503 --> 00:23:06,588
I hope you'll be a dancer, like mommy.

218
00:23:07,214 --> 00:23:10,174
- Yes.
- Did you enjoy these 3 days?

219
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:13,761
We don't see each other much, do we?
Today I made the effort.

220
00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:15,679
- I'm a good mother?
- Yes.

221
00:23:15,846 --> 00:23:17,305
Give me a kiss.

222
00:23:20,392 --> 00:23:22,685
Close your eyes, go to sleep.

223
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,812
Eyes closed.
Go to sleep.

224
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:29,065
I'll come back because I love you.

225
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,442
I love you, Tito.

226
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:35,363
- That big flag is getting to me.
- I don't like it.

227
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,198
I like all flags,
don't get me wrong.

228
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:43,411
The colors and everything, it's all good.
But that same one in your face...

229
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:47,080
Change the decorations, please.

230
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,626
- All those crosses, it's heavy.
- You won't catch anything.

231
00:23:52,794 --> 00:23:54,629
Don't get on your high horse.

232
00:23:56,422 --> 00:23:57,423
God is great.

233
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,258
"God is with us."

234
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:02,678
What's God got to do with dancing?

235
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:05,013
No. I strongly disagree.

236
00:24:05,638 --> 00:24:07,139
What about you?

237
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:09,516
Still the same.

238
00:24:09,934 --> 00:24:11,143
How's your father?

239
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,228
Still in a coma.
We wait and wait.

240
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:15,855
How long has it been?

241
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:19,942
Nearly six months.

242
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:22,194
- That's really long.
- Yeah.

243
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:27,031
If things aren't going well,
for me it's complicated

244
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:30,492
to take drugs unless...

245
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:33,203
it's in a really safe place.

246
00:24:33,954 --> 00:24:37,832
And I thought, with my friend...
It would be safe.

247
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:38,999
Sorry?

248
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:43,545
I thought it was safe with him, but you
never know where stuff comes from.

249
00:24:44,088 --> 00:24:47,340
See that one? I did her yesterday.

250
00:24:48,007 --> 00:24:50,634
- Yesterday, dude.
- Wow.

251
00:24:52,303 --> 00:24:53,846
It wasn't all that.

252
00:24:55,472 --> 00:24:57,640
I'd like to have two blondes.

253
00:24:58,141 --> 00:25:00,685
Stop acting like I don't exist.

254
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:13,529
You're so fuckin' fake.

255
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:16,365
I'm not fake, you're boring.

256
00:25:17,157 --> 00:25:21,619
Lesbian things never work out.
They'll miss fucking, for sure.

257
00:25:24,497 --> 00:25:26,248
The little and big one together!
Oh man!

258
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,251
Aye, c'mon.

259
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:35,464
Since you asked if I'll marry...
Do you want kids?

260
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:40,010
No, I don't care, don't think about it.
Everyone asks such stupid questions.

261
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:43,179
Saying "Watch out, he's this or that way."
I really don't care!

262
00:25:43,346 --> 00:25:46,641
A connection happens, I roll with it.
That's all.

263
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:48,558
On to better things. Next.

264
00:25:55,231 --> 00:25:59,317
She's hooked.
Always something up her nose.

265
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:00,944
Real bad.

266
00:26:01,778 --> 00:26:02,779
Terrible.

267
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,282
- So you said you want to marry?
- Yes.

268
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:08,075
- I heard correctly?
- Yes.

269
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:10,619
- How many times?
- Well once, of course!

270
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,747
I'd want four times at least.

271
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:16,999
Better to do it a few times.

272
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:20,252
New surroundings, new person,
new things.

273
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,879
You see how she acts at her age?

274
00:26:23,963 --> 00:26:27,842
Honestly, I think he's
totally manipulating her.

275
00:26:29,218 --> 00:26:31,637
He's a horndog,
he's tried with all the girls.

276
00:26:31,804 --> 00:26:35,848
He's ambitious, why do you think
he's with the choreographer?

277
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:37,767
He goes with anyone.

278
00:26:38,434 --> 00:26:41,562
With the choreographer, he just wants work.

279
00:26:42,229 --> 00:26:44,648
We're lucky with all these women around us.

280
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:49,985
Brother! Omar! Wake up!
Get out of your little shell!

281
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:52,279
You don't drink, don't do anything...

282
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:54,948
I've had all the women here.

283
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:59,077
That David gives you venereal disease
just by looking at him.

284
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,829
- You're a bit hard!
- That's my friend!

285
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,040
He's nice, but...

286
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,791
he really should...

287
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:10,002
I'm sure he has herpes.
He looks so filthy.

288
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:12,296
Just looking at him...

289
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:16,091
- Stop this!
- It's also exciting, though,

290
00:27:16,257 --> 00:27:20,595
- I'll admit he's an asshole.
- But he can be charming.

291
00:27:20,761 --> 00:27:23,723
- Since you know, is he good in bed?
- Yeah, he's got it.

292
00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:27,017
- Sometimes it's all just an act...
- No, no, really.

293
00:27:27,184 --> 00:27:31,562
- Have you tried it together?
- No, but he did something next to me, and...

294
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,939
- Oh... alright.
- You have little orgies?

295
00:27:34,107 --> 00:27:35,816
He was a champ, I was shocked.

296
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:38,318
Tell me about Gazelle.

297
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:41,113
Just a little, for my curiosity.

298
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,322
Please.

299
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,992
Some small thing. Don't need
all the pussy and anal details

300
00:27:46,158 --> 00:27:49,453
Just something that gets her going.

301
00:27:50,328 --> 00:27:54,415
- Your life is yours, mine is mine.
- Your life is part of my life though.

302
00:27:54,582 --> 00:27:56,125
You're so annoying.

303
00:27:56,291 --> 00:28:00,837
- I don't understand your attitude.
- No, I don't understand yours.

304
00:28:01,004 --> 00:28:03,381
What does Omar have, that others don't?

305
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,008
- He has everything.
- Oh yeah?

306
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:06,759
He's got it all.

307
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:09,803
You know what?
I'd like to nail her.

308
00:28:10,303 --> 00:28:12,014
You're like that with everyone.

309
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,057
Seriously, I'd like to nail her.

310
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:19,103
- You're really lucky, buddy.
- You're not as built as I am.

311
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:24,774
- That solves a lot.
- Maybe we could do a three-way.

312
00:28:25,191 --> 00:28:27,902
Just tell her, "Tonight's the last night",

313
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:33,365
we're getting kind of boring,

314
00:28:33,865 --> 00:28:35,450
it's not like it was before...

315
00:28:35,617 --> 00:28:40,204
Groups are trendy, try wider horizons...
Then you make it happen.

316
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:43,290
- What's bothering you?
- You together. I don't like the guy.

317
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:46,584
- We act like friends, but no.
- What do you care?

318
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:49,086
Well, I'm your big brother.

319
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:52,006
I'm 20. I'm not a baby anymore.

320
00:28:52,173 --> 00:28:53,299
So what?

321
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:55,926
It's disrespectful to me.

322
00:28:56,092 --> 00:29:00,971
- Plus he seems awkward.
- Maybe he is with you.

323
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:03,974
- What does that mean?
- That's what it means.

324
00:29:04,391 --> 00:29:06,685
You're not my father nor mother,
just a big brother.

325
00:29:06,851 --> 00:29:09,270
- And so?
- You're 25, I'm 20. I'm an adult.

326
00:29:09,437 --> 00:29:11,105
But what you're doing here...

327
00:29:11,522 --> 00:29:13,065
you're too young for this.

328
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:15,734
- For what?
- What you're doing with Omar.

329
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:19,487
- And you know what we do?
- I see enough.

330
00:29:19,654 --> 00:29:23,074
- I don't need details.
- You ever get a blowjob.

331
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,536
So what? Because I have
doesn't mean you can blow him any time.

332
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:34,208
- It doesn't work that way.
- After nine months, things happen.

333
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:37,877
- Nine months together already?
- Didn't he tell you?

334
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,754
That's funny to you?

335
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:42,756
Bizarre things must've happened here.

336
00:29:42,924 --> 00:29:45,092
Honestly, I get this eerie vibe.

337
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:48,595
Ritual sacrifices or something.

338
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:51,223
How? Like religious sects?

339
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:56,477
Yeah, you can imagine!
Walk in here with this huge flag flying?

340
00:29:56,978 --> 00:29:58,354
This is unreal!

341
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,857
I don't like the mood of this group.
Everyone's acting weird.

342
00:30:03,024 --> 00:30:06,777
This school building amplifies that.

343
00:30:06,944 --> 00:30:10,572
It enhances weirdness 10 times, I think.

344
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:13,282
Even if they're weird, I'd fuck them.

345
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:17,286
I'm telling you.

346
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:21,581
- Strange or not, I'd bang 'em good.
- You're right, you're right.

347
00:30:21,748 --> 00:30:24,459
- Even if a ghost shows up...
- On the flag!

348
00:30:24,626 --> 00:30:29,088
Then we fuck it on the flag!
Ghost or not, it gets fucked!

349
00:30:29,505 --> 00:30:33,967
I'm fed up of fathers and brothers
dictating to us

350
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:36,511
who we can go out with.

351
00:30:36,677 --> 00:30:39,889
- There aren't only men in life.
- That's for sure.

352
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:43,808
Some women are pretty cool.

353
00:30:44,726 --> 00:30:46,144
For example?

354
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,937
Well, look around,
there are some hotties here.

355
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:50,814
Don't you think?

356
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:52,149
And me?

357
00:30:52,315 --> 00:30:54,734
You know, I told you already.

358
00:30:55,277 --> 00:30:59,947
- Why talk about it then?
- We're not, it's just...

359
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,075
You'll do really dirty things.

360
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:06,745
I'd like that.

361
00:31:07,162 --> 00:31:10,122
I'm beating up those two
guys up tonight, I'll bet.

362
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:14,418
- They asked for it.
- That's for sure.

363
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:18,171
I'm starting to feel no pain.

364
00:31:18,672 --> 00:31:21,174
I could do crazy things.

365
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,885
You're too impulsive,
that's your problem.

366
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:28,471
- Control your cock.
- Look, you only live once.

367
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:32,266
When you have such a big one,
you have to use it.

368
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:33,935
It's a gift!

369
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,479
I should share it with others.

370
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,321
They must use strap-on dildos.

371
00:31:49,197 --> 00:31:51,741
I don't like this talk.

372
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:54,243
Psyche, I'd fuck her.

373
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:58,330
I'd do her good.
Her moves really turn me on.

374
00:31:58,496 --> 00:32:01,333
- Right on the floor.
- Serious. Wet or dry.

375
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:03,501
On bare knees.

376
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:07,379
No lube, nothing.
Wet or not, I wouldn't stop.

377
00:32:07,546 --> 00:32:08,922
I don't stop for anything.

378
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,925
If she bucks, you slap her, no choice.

379
00:32:12,758 --> 00:32:15,052
<i>It's party time!</i>

380
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:20,682
That type? Right to
the back of her throat.

381
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:24,518
No mercy.

382
00:32:24,686 --> 00:32:25,994
- She has to cry!
- She has to cry.

383
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:27,563
I love her.

384
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:32,900
Despite her flaws, her moods

385
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,527
I love her.

386
00:32:36,696 --> 00:32:38,822
You going back to her?

387
00:32:39,906 --> 00:32:42,075
I hope so.

388
00:32:42,576 --> 00:32:45,286
Too bad she's expecting a baby.

389
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:46,954
From another.

390
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:50,582
Not her "sweet butterfly,"
as she calls me.

391
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:53,543
- She's pregnant?
- Yes, she's pregnant.

392
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,629
- From another?
- Yes.

393
00:32:58,422 --> 00:33:02,551
Imagine, the man of your dreams...

394
00:33:04,177 --> 00:33:05,803
loves another.

395
00:33:06,221 --> 00:33:09,056
- Little Lou pretty hot.
- She takes in the ass?

396
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:11,767
Sure, I think so.

397
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:13,394
She's deep into that.

398
00:33:14,311 --> 00:33:16,062
Dry or with lube?

399
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:17,813
Dry, man!

400
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,527
You catch her,

401
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:26,780
spread her arms apart...

402
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:32,660
- Get real.
- That's how it works.

403
00:33:32,826 --> 00:33:35,120
Dry. - Dry!
- No lube.

404
00:33:36,663 --> 00:33:39,749
I don't like that.
I prefer shea butter, you know it?

405
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:43,460
- Shea butter is the best.
- It really slides nicely.

406
00:33:43,878 --> 00:33:46,797
I have to pull her hair.
That's the best.

407
00:33:46,963 --> 00:33:50,883
But I bang her, I fuck her...

408
00:33:51,342 --> 00:33:52,718
That one? Oh...

409
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:54,887
She's good.

410
00:33:55,054 --> 00:33:57,722
- You light her right up.
- Such a nice little ass.

411
00:33:57,889 --> 00:33:59,641
I take care of business.

412
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,644
But, she's not all that.

413
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:06,355
- Yeah, I see that.
- I'm way into Selva.

414
00:34:07,815 --> 00:34:11,943
- When she walks, I want to screw her down.
- The way she looks and speaks...

415
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:14,320
- I'm crazy for her.
- You're nuts...

416
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:16,989
I get it, though, you want to show her who...

417
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:20,408
Show her I've got this horn, you see?

418
00:34:20,576 --> 00:34:24,245
With her, some day, after rehearsal

419
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:27,122
you follow her to her room.

420
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:29,874
You show it to her.

421
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:31,668
Just show it.

422
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,420
Just show her.

423
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:37,965
- You mean my cock?
- You have to.

424
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:40,258
- She'll go right at it.
- That's it!

425
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:43,720
Then you have to put it
in her ass directly.

426
00:34:43,886 --> 00:34:45,930
- Don't even hesitate.
- No hesitation.

427
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:49,766
I'm not mad, but you're not listening.

428
00:34:50,184 --> 00:34:51,768
So after a while...

429
00:34:51,935 --> 00:34:54,437
I'm just not into it.

430
00:34:54,604 --> 00:34:56,522
- What?
- All the waiting.

431
00:34:56,689 --> 00:35:00,609
- A little wait is good...
- It's better to wait.

432
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:05,905
You're young. You're rich.
You'll get plenty of cock.

433
00:35:06,364 --> 00:35:10,201
- You're crazy. - You don't have
to do everything immediately.

434
00:35:10,618 --> 00:35:12,495
Take your time.
Don't be like the others.

435
00:35:12,661 --> 00:35:14,913
I'll have David in two days.

436
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:19,542
- David won't go with you.
- You'll see...

437
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:23,170
- Selva won't let it happen.
- Who cares about Selva?

438
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:26,757
Not sure you understand but,
who cares what Selva thinks?

439
00:35:27,673 --> 00:35:28,966
Who is she anyway?

440
00:35:29,384 --> 00:35:33,053
With David, hop hop, then it's done.

441
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,473
Do as you wish.
You always do things your way.

442
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,019
- I told you that from the start.
- That's why you're still a virgin.

443
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,187
Not for long.

444
00:35:43,354 --> 00:35:45,564
- Sure, with David it won't be.
- That's right.

445
00:35:45,981 --> 00:35:49,151
- You can tell he's a virgin.
- It needs to happen.

446
00:35:49,317 --> 00:35:52,779
He must get his ass reamed.

447
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,031
With a stick.

448
00:35:57,908 --> 00:35:58,909
A big bat.

449
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:04,163
You know, they scream at first,
then they want more.

450
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,582
I stay away from that back door.
It's not my thing.

451
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,877
- If it smells like shit, I stay away.
- Stop all that!

452
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:13,922
Not the ass.

453
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,590
You know what you do?
You lick it.

454
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,508
- What?
- The asshole.

455
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:24,055
- No way.
- Lick.

456
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:26,891
- Put your tongue in it.
- Even if it stinks?

457
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:28,767
Don't worry, dude.

458
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:31,812
- That's nature!
- Seriously?

459
00:36:31,978 --> 00:36:33,438
Just part of the job.

460
00:36:33,604 --> 00:36:35,773
Does shit ever come out?

461
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,026
No, but things happen.

462
00:36:39,568 --> 00:36:41,236
Just part of the job.

463
00:36:42,195 --> 00:36:46,699
You go there,
you know what can happen.

464
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:49,327
If it happens, don't be surprised.

465
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:54,038
It's a gamble.
In, out, in, out...

466
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:00,044
I put Tito to bed.
I can't take any more.

467
00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:03,046
- Pass me a cig.
- Your kid is a sweetheart.

468
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:07,007
We're good when we start out, we're young.

469
00:37:07,175 --> 00:37:08,468
And then...

470
00:37:10,302 --> 00:37:12,721
you get fucked in some corner,

471
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:14,556
then you get pregnant.

472
00:37:14,723 --> 00:37:16,516
What then?

473
00:37:16,683 --> 00:37:20,436
Your worst mistake needs to become
your greatest success.

474
00:37:21,312 --> 00:37:24,356
I don't even know when
the van is coming tomorrow.

475
00:37:24,522 --> 00:37:26,066
And everybody dances happily.

476
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:29,401
The only success in my life
is this sangria.

477
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:31,487
It <i>is</i> really good.

478
00:37:35,115 --> 00:37:36,241
There you have it.

479
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:59,959
For France, people!

480
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:02,545
We'll blow the Americans away!

481
00:46:02,711 --> 00:46:04,755
Annihilate them!

482
00:46:06,048 --> 00:46:08,258
It's war!

483
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,055
Brought you:

484
00:46:35,573 --> 00:46:36,949
Dancing to music by:

485
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,757
Filmed by:

486
00:47:26,657 --> 00:47:28,450
It's hot in here!

487
00:47:29,284 --> 00:47:31,120
Booty parade!

488
00:47:32,912 --> 00:47:35,456
- Lou, do you want my glass?
- No thanks.

489
00:47:36,374 --> 00:47:38,792
You know what?
The sangria is halal.

490
00:47:39,335 --> 00:47:40,503
Oh shit.

491
00:47:50,302 --> 00:47:51,803
I feel weird.

492
00:47:52,304 --> 00:47:53,889
Go drink some water.

493
00:48:09,903 --> 00:48:11,154
Selva wants it?

494
00:48:11,904 --> 00:48:13,864
Give me some coke, please.

495
00:48:14,031 --> 00:48:15,490
Give me some coke.

496
00:48:15,657 --> 00:48:17,159
I don't have any.

497
00:48:17,617 --> 00:48:19,285
Ask the junkie.

498
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:31,212
- Sweetheart, please give me some coke.
- I have none left.

499
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:34,506
- I heard you did.
- No more, leave it be.

500
00:48:35,507 --> 00:48:36,800
Everything alright?

501
00:48:36,966 --> 00:48:38,718
- All good.
- Give me a light.

502
00:48:40,637 --> 00:48:42,555
Daddy? Daddy, look!
Look, look, look...

503
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:45,349
Over there, watch.

504
00:49:00,195 --> 00:49:01,237
What you are doing?

505
00:49:01,404 --> 00:49:02,155
Gazelle!

506
00:49:02,322 --> 00:49:03,698
It's hot as hell.

507
00:49:03,864 --> 00:49:06,742
- Damn it, he's here.
- Something's happening.

508
00:49:09,661 --> 00:49:10,870
Gazelle!

509
00:49:11,037 --> 00:49:12,497
I'm going.

510
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,651
Bravo!

511
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,029
Now it's a party!

512
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,409
Daddy?

513
00:50:02,414 --> 00:50:03,874
What's going on here?

514
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,126
It's a party.
Don't worry.

515
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:10,337
Go have fun. You deserve it.
Dance, my beauty.

516
00:50:10,505 --> 00:50:11,714
A party...

517
00:50:40,113 --> 00:50:41,572
What have you done?

518
00:50:42,281 --> 00:50:43,741
What are you talking about?

519
00:50:44,616 --> 00:50:46,326
I didn't do anything.

520
00:50:58,586 --> 00:50:59,587
Selva!

521
00:51:00,047 --> 00:51:01,548
I didn't do anything.

522
00:51:03,382 --> 00:51:05,342
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

523
00:51:06,843 --> 00:51:09,262
- She's not feeling well?
- I don't know.

524
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:11,848
Selva?

525
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:14,767
Are you alright?

526
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:18,895
You're all too drunk.
I'm going to bed.

527
00:51:34,826 --> 00:51:36,786
Hey, do you want to clean up?

528
00:51:49,755 --> 00:51:51,840
What is it?
Not feeling well?

529
00:51:59,513 --> 00:52:00,556
Selva?

530
00:52:07,437 --> 00:52:09,230
Anyone else feel strange?

531
00:52:09,396 --> 00:52:13,317
What have you done?
What's in the sangria? I'm not well.

532
00:52:13,484 --> 00:52:14,943
What are you talking about?

533
00:52:15,694 --> 00:52:17,153
I didn't do anything.

534
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,864
- What have you done?
- What's with everyone?

535
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,031
Daddy!

536
00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:24,493
That bitch spiked the drinks.

537
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:29,205
Something is in the sangria.
It wasn't me. I drank it too.

538
00:52:29,372 --> 00:52:32,250
- That's why I feel so bad.
- It wasn't me.

539
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:33,959
What did you put in there?

540
00:52:34,126 --> 00:52:37,837
- There's the bitter bitch.
- I drank it too!

541
00:52:39,088 --> 00:52:40,548
Stop!

542
00:52:41,215 --> 00:52:44,760
Listen to her!
It was someone who didn't drink it.

543
00:52:44,926 --> 00:52:47,846
I know who it was!
It was Omar, that son of a bitch!

544
00:52:48,013 --> 00:52:49,889
- Get real!
- It wasn't him!

545
00:52:50,056 --> 00:52:53,225
- He didn't drink sangria!
- You put LSD in it?

546
00:52:53,392 --> 00:52:56,061
- I'm fucked up because of you!
- Why did you do that?

547
00:52:56,895 --> 00:52:58,688
- What did you do?
- It wasn't me!

548
00:52:58,855 --> 00:52:59,856
It was him!

549
00:53:00,023 --> 00:53:01,149
Let him go!

550
00:53:01,315 --> 00:53:03,192
Stop! Stop!

551
00:53:16,537 --> 00:53:17,579
Asshole!

552
00:53:19,498 --> 00:53:20,666
Open up!

553
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:22,667
Let me go!

554
00:53:33,509 --> 00:53:35,386
- LSD is acid?
- I don't know!

555
00:53:35,553 --> 00:53:37,930
- Is there an antidote?
- Coke.

556
00:53:41,558 --> 00:53:43,643
Give us, we need some.

557
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,603
I have nothing, go away!

558
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:48,439
- So it was not you?
- No.

559
00:53:48,605 --> 00:53:51,358
- For sure?
- We're all taking off.

560
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,402
We're all high, don't you see?

561
00:53:57,822 --> 00:53:59,573
- You alright?
- No! Are you crazy?

562
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,284
- Have you seen your son?
- Oh fuck.

563
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:09,582
Don't drink that!
You can't drink that. We're leaving.

564
00:54:09,748 --> 00:54:12,250
- No mommy!
- They're all crazy here.

565
00:54:13,376 --> 00:54:14,794
Mommy, no!

566
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,879
Please calm down!

567
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:20,049
Stop tugging! Come!

568
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,136
Come on.
Stop it now.

569
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,015
Mommy...

570
00:54:31,308 --> 00:54:32,309
No...

571
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:36,563
No, mommy, you're mean!

572
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:40,399
- No, I love you and want to protect you.
- You don't love me!

573
00:54:40,941 --> 00:54:42,568
You're mean!

574
00:54:45,904 --> 00:54:47,822
Listen to me.

575
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:50,783
You don't touch that.

576
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,994
It'll kill you if you do.

577
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,454
- No mommy!
- Don't touch.

578
00:54:56,455 --> 00:54:58,039
Don't leave me alone!

579
00:54:59,082 --> 00:55:01,209
Open the door, Mommy!

580
00:55:02,418 --> 00:55:07,422
I can't. I'll come back,
I'll fix this, don't worry.

581
00:55:08,131 --> 00:55:11,760
I'll be back. I love you.
Calm down, please.

582
00:55:11,926 --> 00:55:13,386
What are you doing there?

583
00:55:15,554 --> 00:55:17,765
- I'm protecting him from you.
- From us?

584
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:19,432
From all of you!

585
00:55:40,284 --> 00:55:41,743
Fuck you!

586
00:55:43,536 --> 00:55:47,665
Fuck yourself, stupid hooker!
Useless bitch!

587
00:56:01,134 --> 00:56:02,177
Selva?

588
00:56:02,928 --> 00:56:03,929
Selva!

589
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:08,724
I'm talking to you.

590
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,353
Do you hear me?

591
00:56:14,438 --> 00:56:15,939
I need you.

592
00:56:33,245 --> 00:56:34,705
I'm sorry.

593
00:56:41,126 --> 00:56:42,586
What's wrong with you?

594
00:56:44,713 --> 00:56:47,549
- I'm not feeling well.
- Did you drink too?

595
00:56:48,049 --> 00:56:49,550
No I didn't drink.

596
00:56:52,845 --> 00:56:54,888
Why don't you feel well then?

597
00:57:02,603 --> 00:57:04,021
Are you alright?

598
00:57:05,147 --> 00:57:08,984
They put something in the sangria.
It was Emmanuelle, I don't know

599
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:11,027
What's with everyone?

600
00:57:12,111 --> 00:57:14,113
What's with all of you?

601
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:17,407
Why don't you feel well?

602
00:57:21,327 --> 00:57:24,330
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yes.

603
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:26,582
Always.

604
00:57:27,457 --> 00:57:28,708
Selva.

605
00:57:29,876 --> 00:57:32,211
Can you keep a secret for me?

606
00:57:33,212 --> 00:57:35,006
Can you please do that?

607
00:57:38,384 --> 00:57:39,635
Of course.

608
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:40,969
I...

609
00:57:44,472 --> 00:57:48,308
I have a little something
growing in my tummy.

610
00:57:53,813 --> 00:57:54,856
What?

611
00:57:56,149 --> 00:57:57,816
I'm pregnant, Selva!

612
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:02,404
Shit.

613
00:58:04,906 --> 00:58:05,907
Yes.

614
00:58:07,533 --> 00:58:08,617
Shit.

615
00:58:10,494 --> 00:58:12,120
What will you do?

616
00:58:12,287 --> 00:58:13,705
I don't know.

617
00:58:15,956 --> 00:58:17,417
Who's the father?

618
00:58:18,793 --> 00:58:20,252
I don't know.

619
00:58:22,046 --> 00:58:23,713
I don't know who it is.

620
00:58:25,131 --> 00:58:26,883
I'm fucked up.

621
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:28,676
Aren't you?

622
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:30,135
No, we're fine.

623
00:58:30,303 --> 00:58:31,595
You're fine?

624
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:37,475
- Could you leave us alone?
- Why?

625
00:58:37,642 --> 00:58:39,226
She's being weird.

626
00:58:41,062 --> 00:58:42,854
You didn't drink anything.

627
00:58:43,647 --> 00:58:45,356
No she didn't.

628
00:58:46,024 --> 00:58:47,608
She doesn't feel well.

629
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:51,446
- I don't feel well either.
- Could you please...

630
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:55,699
- Strange. Why didn't you drink?
- Because I'm not feeling well!

631
00:58:57,241 --> 00:59:01,287
- You drugged us, didn't you?
- No, it wasn't her.

632
00:59:02,871 --> 00:59:04,331
Dom, please!

633
00:59:04,498 --> 00:59:06,541
- You did it.
- Stop it now.

634
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:08,168
You're talking nonsense.

635
00:59:09,043 --> 00:59:11,295
- Are you crazy?
- You did it.

636
00:59:11,462 --> 00:59:13,589
You're all sick.
Go dance.

637
00:59:13,755 --> 00:59:16,592
I threw Omar outside, because

638
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:19,552
Because of you.

639
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:22,222
- Why didn't you drink?
- She's pregnant!

640
00:59:22,388 --> 00:59:24,264
- Give us two seconds.
- Pregnant?

641
00:59:24,431 --> 00:59:26,683
Pregnant, you fake bitch?

642
00:59:31,479 --> 00:59:33,106
False bastard.

643
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,733
Stupid cow.

644
00:59:37,192 --> 00:59:38,610
Little slut.

645
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:51,621
Call an ambulance, please!

646
00:59:53,831 --> 00:59:55,958
Will nobody help me?

647
01:00:05,299 --> 01:00:06,300
Lou?

648
01:00:08,636 --> 01:00:10,053
What is it, Lou?

649
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:13,181
What have you done?

650
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:38,494
You're really a bitch.

651
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:40,621
You had some all that time.

652
01:00:41,121 --> 01:00:43,540
- Give me some.
- Leave me alone.

653
01:01:02,932 --> 01:01:03,933
Lou!

654
01:01:05,892 --> 01:01:07,436
- Wait!
- Let me go!

655
01:01:07,894 --> 01:01:09,270
Leave me alone!

656
01:01:12,773 --> 01:01:13,941
Dom!

657
01:01:14,107 --> 01:01:15,567
I'll kill you!

658
01:01:16,193 --> 01:01:17,860
Dom, I'll kill you!

659
01:01:21,989 --> 01:01:24,450
Mom, there are cockroaches!

660
01:01:33,207 --> 01:01:36,251
This is a nightmare.

661
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:44,092
What's happening?
What's going on here?

662
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:47,761
Dom!

663
01:01:48,636 --> 01:01:50,138
Can anybody...

664
01:02:00,313 --> 01:02:02,440
Do you want to see my anaconda?

665
01:02:05,818 --> 01:02:08,028
Where is Dom?
Where is Dom?

666
01:02:14,868 --> 01:02:17,411
Hey Taylor, look at your sister!

667
01:02:18,329 --> 01:02:19,830
Look at her!

668
01:02:27,169 --> 01:02:28,420
Why'd you do that?

669
01:02:35,801 --> 01:02:37,512
Why did you do that?

670
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:42,391
- She hit me!
- Look!

671
01:02:42,557 --> 01:02:47,728
We threw out the wrong guy.
Omar didn't poison us, she did.

672
01:02:48,396 --> 01:02:50,231
- You drugged us?
- Yes, it was her.

673
01:02:50,398 --> 01:02:54,317
- What are you talking saying?
- And she says she's pregnant.

674
01:02:54,484 --> 01:02:56,194
Who are you pregnant with?

675
01:02:56,361 --> 01:02:58,571
By who?
Who would want you?

676
01:02:58,738 --> 01:03:02,408
- You lie! Ever since the audition!
- Who did you fuck?

677
01:03:02,574 --> 01:03:05,076
You're pregnant?
You're the accomplice!

678
01:03:05,243 --> 01:03:08,246
Not at all!
Keep your mouth shut!

679
01:03:08,788 --> 01:03:12,374
I don't know what you're talking about!
What are you talking about?

680
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:14,626
It's David's son!

681
01:03:14,793 --> 01:03:16,253
Leave me alone!

682
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:22,175
Come on, do her!

683
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:26,303
What will you do?

684
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:31,098
You'll hit me again?
She hit me!

685
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,893
Come on, kill yourself!

686
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:37,896
Shut up!
Back off!

687
01:03:39,022 --> 01:03:41,482
- Come on!
- I'm taking you for an abortion!

688
01:03:41,649 --> 01:03:42,733
Gazelle!

689
01:04:05,044 --> 01:04:08,214
- So, now the baby's dead.
- Kill it!

690
01:04:08,797 --> 01:04:10,966
Now kill yourself!

691
01:04:11,883 --> 01:04:13,593
Come on!

692
01:04:14,594 --> 01:04:16,471
Do it! Do it!

693
01:04:31,859 --> 01:04:34,319
- Stop it!
- No, we won't stop.

694
01:04:34,486 --> 01:04:36,362
Please stop.

695
01:04:37,488 --> 01:04:38,948
Gazelle!

696
01:04:43,409 --> 01:04:44,494
Lou!

697
01:04:45,078 --> 01:04:47,330
Don't do that.
Do not do that!

698
01:04:47,747 --> 01:04:50,290
- Leave me!
- It's not your fault.

699
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:54,711
Leave her!
Leave her, Eve!

700
01:05:05,137 --> 01:05:07,597
I don't want you, don't you get it?

701
01:05:16,437 --> 01:05:18,231
Come on, let's get out of here.

702
01:05:24,361 --> 01:05:26,155
I'm sorry, Selva.

703
01:05:34,537 --> 01:05:35,538
Mommy!

704
01:05:36,914 --> 01:05:38,081
Mommy!

705
01:05:45,046 --> 01:05:47,172
I'm sorry, Selva.

706
01:09:39,035 --> 01:09:40,536
Hey, Tito...

707
01:09:41,454 --> 01:09:43,748
Please stop shouting.

708
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:49,335
We'll go away together.

709
01:09:49,502 --> 01:09:52,921
I will find the key again, don't worry.

710
01:09:53,339 --> 01:09:54,798
Open the door.

711
01:09:55,298 --> 01:09:57,425
I lost the key.

712
01:09:58,885 --> 01:10:00,887
- Go find it.
- I lost the key.

713
01:10:01,053 --> 01:10:02,471
Go find it!

714
01:10:02,639 --> 01:10:04,098
I'm afraid!

715
01:10:04,932 --> 01:10:07,518
Let me out, I'm scared!

716
01:10:08,477 --> 01:10:09,560
Selva?

717
01:10:10,645 --> 01:10:13,398
I'm afraid.
Please open the door!

718
01:10:13,564 --> 01:10:15,065
Everything's alright.

719
01:10:18,068 --> 01:10:20,111
Something is moving in here.

720
01:10:22,822 --> 01:10:24,323
This is a party...

721
01:10:26,617 --> 01:10:29,369
There are surprises, balloons...

722
01:10:59,019 --> 01:11:00,979
Mommy! Mommy!

723
01:11:03,648 --> 01:11:05,233
Mommy!

724
01:12:18,336 --> 01:12:20,671
The key is here somewhere...

725
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:37,310
- Come on, you son of a bitch!
- You pig!

726
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:39,855
Come with him.

727
01:12:41,731 --> 01:12:44,442
Come on, get it done!
Finish him!

728
01:12:56,869 --> 01:12:58,245
You dog!

729
01:12:58,996 --> 01:13:01,873
Give me a knife, I'll kill him too!

730
01:13:03,207 --> 01:13:05,293
That's enough, stop!

731
01:13:22,349 --> 01:13:23,809
You're sick.

732
01:13:26,561 --> 01:13:28,271
There.
As punishment.

733
01:13:29,063 --> 01:13:30,940
You don't want to play with me?

734
01:13:42,825 --> 01:13:44,034
What are you doing?

735
01:13:44,201 --> 01:13:46,286
- Give me that!
- What are you talking about?

736
01:13:46,453 --> 01:13:48,371
- The lipstick!
- That hurts!

737
01:13:48,538 --> 01:13:50,247
- Let go damn it!
- That hurts!

738
01:13:50,873 --> 01:13:52,624
There, for fuck's sake!

739
01:13:54,918 --> 01:13:56,086
Asshole!

740
01:13:56,252 --> 01:14:00,423
You little fuck.
You mess with me?

741
01:14:07,011 --> 01:14:09,263
Bastard!
Asshole!

742
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,725
Leave him alone!

743
01:14:27,738 --> 01:14:29,948
Please help me.

744
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:32,658
Please...

745
01:14:37,913 --> 01:14:38,955
Please!

746
01:14:40,332 --> 01:14:41,374
Please...

747
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:21,533
Selva, come with me.

748
01:16:07,405 --> 01:16:09,407
Oh shit, Tito fried up!

749
01:16:14,494 --> 01:16:16,705
Oh fuck, I killed him.

750
01:16:16,871 --> 01:16:18,164
Fried up! Gone!

751
01:16:18,748 --> 01:16:19,874
Tito!

752
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:23,419
- Stop screaming!
- Music!

753
01:16:25,045 --> 01:16:28,173
- Music!
- I'll get my ghetto blaster.

754
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:33,886
Yeah, I'll put it on.

755
01:16:56,489 --> 01:16:58,073
Open, Tito!

756
01:16:58,532 --> 01:16:59,992
- Selva!
- Open up!

757
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:01,201
Come!

758
01:17:33,896 --> 01:17:35,438
Come on!

759
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,299
- What are you doing?
- The blood...

760
01:18:08,049 --> 01:18:10,217
The blood, the blood...

761
01:19:57,558 --> 01:19:58,559
Selva.

762
01:20:00,728 --> 01:20:02,729
Get out! Get out!

763
01:20:17,784 --> 01:20:20,286
What do you want?
Why...

764
01:20:20,452 --> 01:20:21,913
What do you want?

765
01:20:23,747 --> 01:20:25,457
Get out.

766
01:20:25,624 --> 01:20:28,043
I don't want to see you.

767
01:20:28,209 --> 01:20:29,919
I don't want to see you!

768
01:20:46,349 --> 01:20:48,018
Leave the girls alone.

769
01:21:19,587 --> 01:21:21,588
Baby, don't cry.

770
01:21:22,964 --> 01:21:24,591
My little baby.

771
01:21:29,428 --> 01:21:30,887
Everything will work out.

772
01:21:32,305 --> 01:21:34,975
- We're at home.
- Daddy, I'm scared.

773
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:40,645
- What's going on here?
- We're at home.

774
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,647
Riley?

775
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:47,443
- You get out.
- Get lost.

776
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,112
Get out of here!

777
01:21:51,363 --> 01:21:52,614
Get lost!

778
01:22:10,671 --> 01:22:12,840
Don't do that.
Get away, damn it!

779
01:22:15,008 --> 01:22:16,468
You wanker!

780
01:22:16,635 --> 01:22:17,719
Gazelle!

781
01:22:21,222 --> 01:22:22,223
Gazelle!

782
01:22:23,223 --> 01:22:24,307
Wait!

783
01:22:31,188 --> 01:22:32,314
Wait!

784
01:22:35,692 --> 01:22:37,527
It's too dangerous!

785
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:44,324
Gazelle, wait.
It's too dangerous!

786
01:22:44,491 --> 01:22:45,993
I'll kill myself!

787
01:22:46,618 --> 01:22:48,537
I only want to protect you.

788
01:22:48,703 --> 01:22:50,204
I'm coming, Tito!

789
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:55,959
Gazelle!

790
01:22:56,126 --> 01:22:57,711
Wait for me, Gazelle!

791
01:23:01,756 --> 01:23:02,757
Gazelle!

792
01:23:04,091 --> 01:23:06,927
Hold me close, Gazelle.
I know we can't do that.

793
01:23:07,094 --> 01:23:08,262
Let me go.

794
01:23:49,296 --> 01:23:51,673
- I'm sorry, Gazelle.
- Let me go.

795
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,426
- We go away together.
- Look at what you did to Omar!

796
01:23:55,594 --> 01:23:58,721
Only you that matter.
Tell me you love me.

797
01:23:58,887 --> 01:24:00,306
Let me go.

798
01:24:00,556 --> 01:24:02,641
Mommy!
What you are doing?

799
01:24:02,808 --> 01:24:05,935
- I love you, Gazelle.
- I'll tell mom and dad.

800
01:24:06,478 --> 01:24:08,437
I just want to go.

801
01:24:09,355 --> 01:24:10,689
- I love you.
- No!

802
01:24:11,898 --> 01:24:12,899
Gazelle!

803
01:24:13,775 --> 01:24:15,235
Let me go!

804
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:21,490
- Help!
- I'm here, don't scream. I'm here.

805
01:24:21,657 --> 01:24:22,657
Let me go!

806
01:24:23,075 --> 01:24:25,994
- You're a liar.
- I'm not. I love you.

807
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,496
You're disgusting.

808
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:30,539
We'll go wherever you want.
Want to go to New York?

809
01:24:30,706 --> 01:24:32,833
- Let me go.
- I want to be with you.

810
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,337
- You can only be with me
- Everyone's watching. Please, not here!

811
01:24:39,046 --> 01:24:40,047
Not here!

812
01:25:44,686 --> 01:25:46,270
What's wrong with you?

813
01:25:52,609 --> 01:25:54,069
Hold me close, Gazelle.

814
01:25:54,819 --> 01:25:56,362
You're my everything.

815
01:25:56,987 --> 01:25:58,448
Come with me.

816
01:25:59,239 --> 01:26:01,325
We'll go to the room, Gazelle.

817
01:26:05,078 --> 01:26:06,579
We'll go to the room.

818
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:08,581
The room.

819
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:15,003
You're everything to me, Gazelle.
Everything.

820
01:27:35,321 --> 01:27:36,321
Please...

821
01:30:04,406 --> 01:30:06,240
Do it! Do it!

822
01:30:07,616 --> 01:30:08,617
Do it!

823
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:11,620
Do it! Do it!

824
01:30:14,831 --> 01:30:17,792
Living is a collective impossibility

825
01:32:36,618 --> 01:32:38,119
Look at this.

826
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:46,376
Madame?

827
01:32:48,210 --> 01:32:49,503
Madame?

828
01:32:56,634 --> 01:32:58,136
She's gone.

829
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:41,464
Death is an extraordinary experience

830
01:34:11,448 --> 01:34:12,991
Nothing happened.

831
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:16,119
- What?
- Nothing happened.

832
01:34:16,994 --> 01:34:18,454
What are you talking about?

833
01:34:21,373 --> 01:34:22,707
Don't tell dad.

834
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:24,959
Don't tell dad.
