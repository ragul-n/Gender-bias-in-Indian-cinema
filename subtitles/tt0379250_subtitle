I will burn your whole family.

1918
02:24:21,845 --> 02:24:25,243
- I won't spare that wretch!
- Where are you going?

1919
02:24:26,505 --> 02:24:28,171
You have gained conscious
with such difficulty!

1920
02:24:28,296 --> 02:24:30,283
You are wounded! That is my job.

1921
02:24:30,530 --> 02:24:31,732
No, dad! Let me go!

1922
02:24:46,514 --> 02:24:48,184
This locket...

1923
02:24:49,262 --> 02:24:50,541
How did you get this?

1924
02:24:50,889 --> 02:24:53,010
This is the locket of my
accepted sister, Ganga.

1925
02:24:53,836 --> 02:24:55,733
- Ganga?
- Yes.

1926
02:24:56,499 --> 02:24:58,843
Ganga is not your accepted
sister, you fool.

1927
02:24:59,355 --> 02:25:00,978
She is your real sister.

1928
02:25:01,548 --> 02:25:02,774
She is my daughter.

1929

02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:07,018
Ganga is our daughter.

1931
02:25:07,871 --> 02:25:11,101
Bhawani Singh,
which trick are you playing now?

1932
02:25:11,226 --> 02:25:13,339
BHAVANI: I am not playing any trick,
Thakur.

1933
02:25:13,753 --> 02:25:15,397
You are playing a trick.

1934
02:25:15,695 --> 02:25:17,356
You can't turn the truth into false.

1935
02:25:17,547 --> 02:25:19,899
You can't call other
children your siblings.

1936
02:25:20,081 --> 02:25:23,296
What proof do you have that
Ganga is not our child?

1937
02:25:28,325 --> 02:25:30,763
Does this locket not belong to Ganga?

1938
02:25:36,575 --> 02:25:39,309
Swear to the Goddess Durga...

1939
02:25:39,700 --> 02:25:42,940
...that you have given birth to Ganga.

1940
02:25:43,519 --> 02:25:46,479
BHAVANI: And your blood
is running in her veins.

1941
02:25:46,604 --> 02:25:49,197
Who are you to account for blood?

1942
02:25:49,461 --> 02:25:52,314
Give me a proper answer
to my proper question.

1943
02:25:52,459 --> 02:25:53,391
MRS. HARNAM: Bhawani!

1944
02:25:54,697 --> 02:25:57,736
Don't take a false
swear on Goddess Durga.

1945
02:25:59,088 --> 02:26:02,186
Remember... even you are a mother.

1946
02:26:07,708 --> 02:26:12,746
Yes... yes. This is the truth.
I haven't borne Ganga.

1947
02:26:13,913 --> 02:26:17,404
And even this is true that
the child had this locket.

1948
02:26:18,475 --> 02:26:21,603
We got the child as she
was moving in the Ganges.

1949
02:26:22,750 --> 02:26:24,476
Since that day...

1950
02:26:25,173 --> 02:26:27,539
...we reared her as our daughter.

1951
02:26:28,323 --> 02:26:33,239
We forgot our child's
sorrow in her smiles.

1952
02:26:33,905 --> 02:26:36,590
Ganga is my child.

1953
02:26:37,746 --> 02:26:40,125
As soon as you took your curse back...

1954
02:26:40,457 --> 02:26:43,878
...I got Ganga's both
brothers, Shiv and Shanker too.

1955

Will you snatch Ganga from us?

Bhawani...

1958
02:26:54,059 --> 02:26:56,376
will you make us childless once again?

1959
02:26:56,551 --> 02:27:01,114
Thakur... you had got my
child from the Ganges.

1960
02:27:01,796 --> 02:27:04,617
It has become Ganges's boon for you.

1961

She was your child previously and...

1962
02:27:07,715 --> 02:27:10,220
...she is your child even today.

1963
02:27:10,604 --> 02:27:14,492
Bhawani, giving Ganga back...

1964
02:27:14,878 --> 02:27:16,658
...you have given us our life back.

1965
02:27:16,841 --> 02:27:18,320
But...

1966
02:27:18,928 --> 02:27:21,436
Jwala Singh has taken Ganga's mother...

1967
02:27:21,561 --> 02:27:23,754
...saying that, if you want Radha back...

1968
02:27:23,879 --> 02:27:25,879
...then give Ganga to him.

talk, how will she embrace me?
