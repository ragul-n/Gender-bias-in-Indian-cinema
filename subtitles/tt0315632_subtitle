1
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:32,624
As long as we are on the road...

2
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,609
Hi!
- Thank you

3
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,141
Queen Elizabeth finally arrives!

4
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,546
It's almost 3 and
the show begins at 3!

5
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,152
"Laxmi, you always do this!"

6
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,450
"Arvind, what's the matter?
You look handsome today"

7
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,423
Don't flatter me.
Why are you late?

8
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,551
"If you listen to that story,
you'll miss the story of the film"

9
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,960
What a boring film!

10
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,565
You should thank me

11
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,977
You're watching less of it
thanks to my delaying you

12
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,372
Now we know it's boring

13
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,982
Don't make excuses for your mistake

14
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,446
Did I tell you that
you look cute in a temper?

15
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,686
5 thousand 6 hundred and 56 times

16
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,257
I see. That's why
you're always in a rage!

17
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,920
Now I know...
- Me? There's a limit...!

18
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,191
Please let us watch the film

19
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,942
What...?
- Who was late last Saturday?

20
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,642
I had a punctured tyre.
It was a genuine problem

21
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,511
Genuine problem?
I purposely come late

22
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,711
I can't have a problem
but yours is genuine...

23
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,288
Romeo Juliet...
go out and fight

24
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,952
Sorry boss. Shut up

25
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,560
"No, you tell me..."

26
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,370
I can't have a problem.
Only you can have a problem

27
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,974
You are the problem

28
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:06,972
I'm the problem?
So what should I do?

29
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,644
Sit down! Let us watch the film!

30
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,676
This is a great system

31
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,681
You make the mistake
and get angry too!

32
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,416
"I made the mistake?
- No, we did"

33
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,591
We're disturbing you guys

34
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,655
Speak louder.
What are you saying?

35
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,921
Look at me and tell me
what are you saying?

36
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,532
"Nothing, good god!"

37
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,062
The truth is you
love to make me wait

38
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,162
And don't smile.
- Of course

39
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,936
Waiting is another word for love

40
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,941
I might end up waiting all my life!

41
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,446
Stay angry but wasting 3
hours for this stupid film...!

42
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,415
I'm wasting your time?
Who asked you to come?

43
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,957
Who bought the tickets?
Did I buy them?

44
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,019
I'm being traumatized...
- Is that my fault?

45
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,154
"I don't want to see it!
- No, we'll see it again"

46
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,962
Cut this movie.
Their story is more interesting

47
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:14,373
I sniff you on the roads

48
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:20,645
"Life warns me, I'll
waste my time wandering"

49
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,416
Is this love?

50
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,592
Is this love?

51
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,921
"Yes, it is love"

52
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,931
"Yes, it is love!"

53
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:39,936
I sniff you out on the roads

54
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:46,344
I waste life wandering around

55
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:52,947
Is this love?

56
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:58,622
"Yes, it is love"

57
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,311
Is it love?

58
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,634
You are incurably sick

59
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,001
Because you run far from love

60
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:26,902
Let those watching us rouse

61
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,246
Let bygones be bygones

62
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,577
We are prepared

63
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,956
I love this... yumm...

64
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,631
I want to get married

65
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,368
Who is stopping you?
Is somebody stopping you?

66
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,471
Stop joking.
I mean your Dad

67
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,113
"I'm with Arvind, eating ice cream"

68
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,989
The one whom I love

69
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,255
Ok Dad

70
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,331
What did he say?
- He said he loves you and hi

71
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,005
What else do I say?
You know how he is

72
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,599
Your Papa...!

73
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,533
Just because he's a cop
he bullies everyone!

74
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,238
He looks more like an underworld
Don and less like a cop!

75
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,007
Laxmi is a kid.
Show him your birth certificate!

76
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:13,011
Kid! I don't understand
what I should do!

77
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,009
48

78
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,353
You said this 48 times

79
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,356
I am talking about our future

80
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,952
Can't you be serious for 2 minutes?

81
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,563
Thinking about it is making my head
ache and it doesn't matter to you!

82
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,661
Don't you know how much I love you?

83
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,473
Answer me.
- Yes but...

84
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,472
Nothing else matters to me

85
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,473
When we know Papa wont' agree...

86
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,983
What's the point talking about it?
We have to take the decision

87
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,978
But what the hell is to be done?

88
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,213
49

89
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,619
Shall we elope?

90
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,952
Go straight to Jodhpur. Get married
and take the photograph to Delhi

91
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,223
To your Dad

92
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,959
He will be hopping mad
The Jodhpur heat will cool him off

93
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,234
Anyway you...
- When?

94
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,980
The strength of a storm

95
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,741
The roar of lightning

96
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:58,190
We have to tear apart the clouds

97
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:05,393
"We have to sacrifice
everything for love"

98
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,993
We have the passion of the sea

99
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,005
We can ignite you

100
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,938
"We have to bring
the moon down to earth"

101
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:27,347
"We have to sacrifice
everything for love"

102
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,970
Wiping our tracks

103
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,634
We have to get ahead

104
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:02,982
"On the way, we'll
change the world"

105
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,322
We have the survival of a storm

106
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,295
The flight of birds

107
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:16,532
We must reach the skies

108
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,440
We do not fear anyone

109
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,638
"Accept it there's none
like us in the world"

110
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,974
We are strong as rocks

111
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,984
We have the determination

112
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:12,680
We have to meet the challenges

113
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,260
"We have to make all
sacrifices for love"

114
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,139
"Though our house is 426
years old, it's beautiful"

115
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,177
"One your Dad sets eyes
on it, he'll forget everything"

116
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,315
Many famous people have lived in it

117
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,716
When George the 5th first
came hunting to India...

118
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,529
What are you doing?

119
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,264
The first lesson of driving. Never
sleep sitting next to the driver

120
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,926
Accidents might be caused

121
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,736
I told you not to sleep. But you can
keep your head on my shoulder

122
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,210
Won't this disturb
you while driving?

123
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,346
Disturb...? Makes it easier

124
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,952
Easy...?

125
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,616
Can't see anything!

126
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,367
I'll see only if you get up.
You're crazy!

127
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,699
That was close!

128
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,944
"Hey, which road leads to Rajgarh?"

129
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,216
Bandipur...

130
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,357
No... I want to know
the road to Rajgarh

131
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,364
I want to go to Bandipur

132
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,629
He looks like your relative

133
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,228
What can I do if you
want to go to Bandipur?

134
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,968
I want to go to Rajgarh.
Do you know the road to Rajgarh?

135
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,912
Go straight...
- Straight from here?

136
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,317
Yes. Then turn right

137
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,520
No left... you'll see a temple

138
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,590
"From the temple, go down..."

139
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,929
You'll see an inn.
Don't stop there

140
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,163
You'll see a well there

141
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,506
With no water.
It's dry

142
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:55,337
From there travel down.
You'll see a field

143
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,575
"No water in the field too.
- Dry, is it?"

144
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,516
You're a thief.
You steal water

145
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,617
You stole my water!

146
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:10,292
Why did you steal water?
- Is he mad?

147
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,962
"Tell me, why!
You stole the water!"

148
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,918
Whose car is that?
- I'll ask

149
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,458
Whom?
- The car or the road

150
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,935
Where's the driver?
Can't see him

151
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,947
I wonder...
I'd just kept him here

152
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,474
Stupid!
- Come on

153
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,256
Now who is this?
- Bunty. My childhood pal

154
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,401
You ask such funny questions.
- What's he doing in this wilderness?

155
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,534
Asking for a lift?
Shall we help him?

156
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,571
Are you mad?
I don't think so

157
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,342
Who else will he
find in the wilderness?

158
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,004
"Come on, let's take him"

159
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,546
Hi.
- Hi

160
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,391
I'm exhausted.
My car had a breakdown

161
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,288
We saw it.
Come on in

162
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:34,966
On every crossroad...

163
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,969
one finds a killer road

164
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,257
You saw the spot my car broke down?
- Yes. Quite a solitary place

165
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:59,987
"Solitary? No sign of humans.
Just camels, no men"

166
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,766
My name is Babu

167
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,004
Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

168
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,741
Trying to go

169
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:15,342
Trying...?
- We're a little lost

170
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,481
Little...
- Where are you coming from?

171
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,546
Delhi.
- Husband and wife?

172
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,017
Not yet

173
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,146
Girl friend!

174
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,552
Love can be great
in this wilderness

175
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,395
What say?

176
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,558
"Smoke?
- No, I don't smoke"

177
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,495
Please don't smoke.
Laxmi has a problem

178
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,969
"Sorry, allergy"

179
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,976
No problem. I'll open the window

180
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,576
Switch off the air condition.
- What are you doing?

181
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:54,976
I told you she has a problem.
- I'm blowing the smoke out

182
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,379
But...
- You've come out...

183
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,648
Enjoy the breeze.
- I'll blow out...

184
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,484
Okay.
- Look...

185
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,395
"Feel anything? You...?
- Okay, smoke on"

186
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,950
"Once you're caught,
you're in deep trouble"

187
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,586
Put that off!

188
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,614
Put something else.
I don't like this

189
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,952
But I like it

190
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,633
You like it?
- No

191
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,300
She likes old K L Saigal songs

192
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,037
Me too.
- He won't let us hear

193
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,731
One has to bear
anything in love

194
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,468
I'm tolerating him for 2 years.
- Then why don't you leave him?

195
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,642
Did anyone tell you
you speak a lot?

196
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:02,444
"Yes, my friends' girl friend"

197
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,979
These days she's in
the mental hospital

198
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,994
You should have gone along.
- I'll use your car to get there

199
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,934
Terribly famished

200
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:30,437
"Excuse me, feed this poor man"

201
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,452
I'm very hungry.
- What can I do?

202
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:38,287
You're driving such a big car.
You must have some food

203
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:39,521
Nothing

204
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,491
"There are biscuits in the
packet behind, eat them"

205
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,963
Am I a dog?
- What?

206
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,255
Dogs eat biscuits

207
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,962
Do something

208
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,133
"Okay, stop at the motel up front.
I'll grab a bite"

209
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:58,306
I'll drop you off and we'll proceed

210
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:01,635
You were to take me to Rajgarh.
- But we're getting late

211
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:06,273
I want to smoke but
you have a problem

212
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,376
I want to hear a song
but you have a problem

213
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,455
I am hungry. Again
you have a problem

214
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,116
What are you saying?
- A man walks for miles...

215
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,986
You saw it...
- Is it my fault?

216
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,652
"And you say, you can't
stop for me to eat"

217
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,260
"Arvind, stop.
You can have coffee"

218
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,933
Stop Arvind.
- I'm stopping

219
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,962
Come on. Join me

220
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,957
In private. With the girl friend

221
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,327
Boy!
- Sir is calling you

222
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,964
Yes sir?
- What can I get?

223
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:07,302
Whatever you want.
- One Qutub Minar with cream

224
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,309
Can't get that

225
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,983
"Then why did you say,
whatever I want?"

226
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:15,975
Sorry sir

227
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,918
"One chicken, 4 baked bread"

228
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,449
One buttermilk

229
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,591
One coffee and for sir...

230
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,924
Ask him. Go on

231
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,939
Did I ask you to give him a lift?
- I had no idea he'd be so obnoxious

232
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,944
Dig in. Great chicken

233
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,941
"Delicious, I'll
pay you 2 bucks extra"

234
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:45,672
Sit down

235
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,346
Take your bags out of my car

236
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,955
We're going to Bassi not Rajgarh

237
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,128
Was the coffee so bad?

238
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,955
They are in different directions

239
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,225
You don't follow

240
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,304
We're going to Bassi not Rajgarh.
Our plan has changed

241
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,299
Take your bags.
- This is cheating

242
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,702
What?
- This is cheating

243
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,147
I have eaten lunch. I am stuffed.
Now I can't walk

244
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,417
"And you say, you're
going to Bassi not Rajgarh"

245
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,587
"Look, I am leaving now"

246
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,914
Take your bags and ask
somebody else for a lift

247
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,419
I see... it's about the car

248
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,598
Since my car broke down
I have to obey others

249
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:39,197
"Let me tell you, whether Rajgarh
or Bassi you have to go straight"

250
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,929
Right? Drop me off there

251
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,406
I'm leaving now. Ask
somebody else for a lift

252
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:51,210
I am requesting you.
Why don't' you understand?

253
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,951
This is a desert.
There's only sand and camels here

254
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,610
Just stones.
No sign of human beings

255
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,046
My car broke down.
Now what do I do?

256
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,615
Who will help me?
There are no shops here

257
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,187
Tooth paste and tooth brush
aren't available here

258
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,287
It's been 24 hours
since I brushed my teeth

259
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:09,457
The people here store water
but don't bathe in it

260
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,297
For months they drink it

261
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,628
Hello... excuse me

262
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,700
I'll drop you at the next turn.
Come on

263
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,110
What about this?

264
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,377
What?

265
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,915
The chicken is yummy
Please... I can't leave it

266
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,143
Give me two minutes

267
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,090
Get me some buttermilk
Boss wont' wait for me

268
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,434
A lotus in a pond

269
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,604
Dream girl

270
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,370
Somewhere I'll find her

271
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,477
Soon in the future

272
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,212
What are you doing?
Sit straight

273
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,709
I'm praising her beauty

274
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,112
Your girl friend is pretty

275
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,948
"Man, you're so lucky!"

276
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,619
You bastard! What a babe!

277
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,224
What? What did you say?

278
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,432
What did you say?
- Didn't ask you to stop the car

279
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,598
Get off!

280
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,298
Why are you getting angry?

281
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,173
I asked you to get off.
- What? What is wrong?

282
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,178
Get off!
- If I don't...?

283
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,448
If I don't...?

284
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,325
Got you!

285
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,259
Now who gets off here? You!

286
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,097
Laxmi and I are leaving

287
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:54,261
"Laxmi, sit in the
driver's seat. Hurry"

288
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,267
Move back

289
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,238
Back...

290
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:04,278
"Talk to me. Don't look at her.
- Arvind, don't do anything!"

291
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,446
Back!

292
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,942
Talk to me.
- Yes. - Obey him!

293
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,317
I'll manage it.
- But he has a gun!

294
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,947
Just shut up!
- Everyone quiet

295
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,284
Now only I will speak.
Babu will speak

296
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,957
What do you want?
- Don't you know what I want?

297
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,463
Can't you understand?

298
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,966
This is a gun.
Not a toy

299
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:33,267
It shoots bullets not water jets.
And the body turns into a dead body

300
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,977
"Laxmi, sit in the driver's seat"

301
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,646
Listen to me...
- Nobody will speak

302
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,379
We're getting late.
We must leave

303
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,283
Drive the car

304
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,011
You've got the car

305
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:21,420
"If you want money, it is in the bag...
- Did I ask for it?"

306
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:24,288
I am bad at heart but not for money

307
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,963
What do you want?
- A driver

308
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,356
I can't drive

309
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,963
"But you said, your car
had a breakdown behind..."

310
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,570
It's a long story

311
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:40,371
Let us first know and
understand each other

312
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,170
Let me go. We'll give
you whatever you want...

313
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,651
Don't be scared.
I won't rape you

314
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,177
Why are you getting in?

315
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,980
My wife has been kidnapped
- I can't help you. Get off!

316
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,987
A hood kidnapped my wife!

317
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,950
Don't try to escape

318
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,944
For miles there's
no place to hide

319
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,553
The bullets in this...

320
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,955
Quietly... silently...

321
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,965
If you disobey it...

322
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,436
Just a minute

323
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,345
How much fuel?
- Want to be an actor?

324
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,939
How... how do you know?

325
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,477
Fill the tank.
- Yes sir

326
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,277
How did you come this way?

327
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,546
For a film shooting

328
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,718
What do you do?

329
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,430
I'm a director

330
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,366
Which... movies have you directed?

331
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,369
I am Devdas

332
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,307
But Sanjay Leela
Bhansali directed it!

333
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,444
That's me

334
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,644
Yes... the beard...
- When did you see?

335
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:08,143
On TV.
- Everything changes with time

336
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,314
Yes...
- Removed the beard from the side

337
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,515
and shifted it to the centre

338
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:14,981
New look

339
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:15,991
New heroine

340
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,391
New hero.
- Whom have you taken?

341
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,598
The new heroin is in the car

342
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:26,329
I'm looking for a hero

343
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:31,341
I only work for the money.
I love acting

344
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,939
My friends says
I resemble Shahrukh Khan

345
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:37,376
It's very good that
you're working with newcomers.

346
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,275
I can dance.
Shall I demonstrate?

347
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:42,641
Okay

348
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,720
Clean the car while dancing

349
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,968
Yes madam? What is it?

350
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,506
Look...
- Why? You're the heroine

351
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,670
"Sir, don't beat me.
That's not right"

352
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,638
Will this do?
- It's not his fault

353
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,972
I called him. He did nothing...

354
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,480
I've seen enough of
canons and guns

355
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,977
This is not good

356
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,447
I'd warned you...
- We are Rajputs

357
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,615
We fought many
battles with the Mughals

358
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:25,360
My name is Bhanwar Singh. I
have a double barreled gun at home

359
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,362
Then get it

360
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,932
This is bullying!
I won't let your shooting take place

361
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,691
What film is this?

362
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,930
Shooting in the petrol pump!
It will catch fire!

363
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,439
I don't want the role!
Never wanted it!

364
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,934
Just go away

365
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,942
Don't smoke...

366
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:51,950
Inhale. Now exhale through the nose.
Continue

367
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,956
I'll show you when you return!

368
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,429
Listen to old songs?

369
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,973
This is Kishore Kumar

370
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:53,940
What's wrong?
- I don't want to talk

371
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,279
Shot bullets!

372
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,618
Are you drunk?
- Shot me but I escaped

373
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,452
Are you drunk?
- No!

374
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,458
Who shot?
- Sanjay Leela Bhansali

375
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,223
Film director.
- Was a girl with him?

376
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,623
The heroine was with him.
She signalled to me so I went to her

377
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,290
Whipped out a gun!
- Where did they go?

378
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,958
That way.
- Sure? Let's go!

379
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,727
Go!
- You're not drunk?

380
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:17,440
Ask him why he shot at me
And make him pay for the fuel

381
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,909
I'll never see his film!

382
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,922
College love is no love

383
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,320
Merely time pass

384
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:44,125
I too was in college.
For 2 years. In the first year

385
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,935
I know the Arvind type well

386
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,502
Clinging on the motor cycle.
Braking suddenly to get the current

387
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:57,472
A new release...
Let's go watch the film

388
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,214
Another film begins
in the darkened hall

389
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,213
A certificate

390
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,947
The moment you can get
a friend's vacant room...

391
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,957
"Say, I love you and
have the honey moon"

392
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,955
"The next day, no memories"

393
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,297
Stupid rascal!

394
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,565
Tell me...

395
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,172
If I too had been in college...

396
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,582
Whom would you pick?
Him or me?

397
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,445
I love Arvind.
- No... you don't get it

398
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:42,518
"When you fell in love with Arvind,
I wasn't there"

399
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,193
How would you know if
Arvind is better than me?

400
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,589
You had no choice then

401
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:54,137
Assume you entered college...

402
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,463
and saw both of us

403
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,933
Whom would you choose?
- What are you saying?

404
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,269
Confused you

405
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,942
Thinking about it
when it's time to make a choice

406
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,381
It's a matter of choice

407
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:08,003
"Hey, come here.
What's going on?"

408
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:11,243
That's what I'm asking
myself for the past 3 months

409
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:15,374
What is going on?
- How so?

410
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,016
How so?
- Yes. The truck?

411
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,756
"Yes, I'm not talking about myself.
- You mean my truck?"

412
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,951
When I bought the truck
from Kartar Singh...

413
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:29,659
He said it would run straight.
- When he said that...

414
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,428
Then how so?
- His words don't matter

415
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,371
The axle broke in the first month.
Then the oil problem

416
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,965
"Axle breaking, oil problem..."

417
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:45,472
But how so...?
- Have you ever driven a truck?

418
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:53,320
Don't listen to him!
Pick the gun!

419
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,301
Don't! Get inside!

420
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,942
Where is he?

421
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,126
He's run away!

422
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,952
She's Laxmi.
- Hello

423
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:41,120
Hello.
- Thanks

424
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:44,629
No... start calling me Sunny Singh

425
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,165
Of Gadar. Didn't see it?

426
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,239
The villain kidnaps Sunny's wife

427
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,502
Here the matter remains in India

428
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,971
But what did Sunny take?

429
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,980
Truck.
- That's right

430
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,479
Got it?
- Yes

431
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:05,680
Sunny

432
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:12,218
Henceforth don't give anyone a lift

433
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,497
and do invite me for the wedding

434
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:26,466
"Lost a little, gained a little"

435
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:37,347
Everything happened in a moment

436
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:48,293
The rain and warm breeze...

437
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:59,306
The crazy wanderers are on the road

438
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:04,170
He wanted to know whom I'd
choose if you and he were together

439
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:08,708
I didn't know what to tell him

440
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:13,650
Points a gun and asks anyone...
- That's not right

441
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:17,119
I was actually thinking
- What?

442
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,919
"When I met you,
he was not this Babu"

443
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:24,263
Now I have a choice.
You or Babu

444
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,599
True. Difficult choice

445
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,938
But I killed my
desires and named you!

446
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,536
That's not right

447
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,540
Did you spare a thought for Babu?
He must be so hurt

448
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,350
I didn't think.
He must be hurt

449
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,284
Very

450
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:46,546
What shall we do?
Turn back and apologise to him?

451
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,949
Yes. Good idea

452
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,958
Given a thought to yourself?
- I'll be rid...

453
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,959
That is why you screamed
before the entire college

454
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:05,632
I made one mistake and
I'm still paying for it

455
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,975
Madam... I too didn't have a choice

456
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:32,926
I have come!

457
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:36,196
I'm back

458
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,082
"Arvind, drive fast!"

459
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,951
That was Inderpal's truck.
But Babu was in it...

460
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,432
He...

461
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:25,965
Did he... lnderpal?

462
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,975
There's nobody here.
Wonder where he is...

463
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,650
Maybe both of them were together...
- Who?

464
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:00,181
Babu and Inderpal.
- Are you nuts?

465
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,688
I met him in the middle of the road.
He gave me a lift

466
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:05,325
He's a truck driver.
He helped me

467
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:08,587
"If Babu had killed him,
we'd find his body"

468
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,990
Babu too isn't here

469
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,993
We have nothing to do with them.
Let's go to Rajgarh

470
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:18,505
All right.
But let's file a complaint

471
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,304
What is it?
- Is this a police station?

472
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,140
Railway station. Didn't
see the board outside?

473
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,641
I want to write a report

474
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,984
What about?

475
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,980
We were on our way from Delhi...

476
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:09,716
We...?
- Me and my wife

477
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,154
Where is she?
- In the car

478
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:15,422
So? - We were going to Rajgarh.
- What are you doing here?

479
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,565
That's what I'm
trying to tell. May I?

480
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,532
Okay.
- We were going to Rajgarh

481
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,935
We met a man called Babu.
His car broke down

482
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,471
We gave him a lift.
- And he fled with your car

483
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:27,541
"No, I have my car.
Now will you please listen?"

484
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:29,502
He kidnapped my wife!

485
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,005
This is a police
not railway station

486
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,948
"Whatever.
- No, police station"

487
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:39,320
Then I followed them in a truck.
- Truck? How?

488
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,284
I took a lift.
- Where is he?

489
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,422
Will you listen to me?

490
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,095
Then the truck driver
helped me rescue my wife

491
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,161
Then Laxmi and I left

492
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,664
Suddenly his truck followed us
and Babu was in it!

493
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,629
But you said you hit him
and he ran away...

494
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:57,298
How do I know? We'd left!
- Saved your life and fled

495
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:01,510
I did go back to look for him.
But he wasn't there. Got that?

496
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:07,981
How was the marriage?
- Great

497
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,646
What great food!

498
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,979
Ratan Singh ate 2 chickens!

499
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,683
And he ate 2 dozen sweets

500
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,923
Now will you write the report?

501
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:28,270
"Write his report.
- Yes, follow me"

502
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,435
You're laughing?

503
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,948
I'm only finding
loonies on the road

504
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,953
Finally when they returned
they were talking of parties

505
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:48,951
You're laughing?
The police station is like a zoo

506
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,950
All cops are the same!
- What?

507
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:57,366
"No, some are good.
Like your respected Dad"

508
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:01,199
Forget this. Now what do we do?

509
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:02,502
What can we do?

510
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,966
It's almost night.
We'll leave early in the morning

511
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,606
It's the name of the hotel

512
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,413
Can we get a room?

513
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:19,922
"If not a room, will you
get a camera in a hotel?"

514
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:25,194
What would you want?
A/C or non?

515
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:29,359
Single or double?

516
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:32,559
Meaning trouble

517
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,333
Nothing... name

518
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:42,943
Are you from
Prithviraj Chauhan's family?

519
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:47,942
Your name?
- The Queen of Jhansi

520
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,319
Write it.
- Shall I lock it?

521
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:55,355
Got the key to unlock?
- Good joke

522
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,915
What are you looking at?

523
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,920
Is this teak?

524
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,533
I'm looking at...

525
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,335
I'm thinking...

526
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:53,279
what material has God made you?

527
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:32,249
A delicate satiny body...

528
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:38,354
is stealing my peace of mind

529
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:44,491
The one who created you is great

530
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:50,935
You are incomparable

531
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,133
The night is silent

532
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,381
We are together

533
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:01,644
There's a look in your eyes

534
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:04,951
...that will make us do wrong

535
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:08,355
Don't show me your passion

536
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:48,928
The journey of the night is great

537
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:54,302
Your eyes raise tumult in my heart

538
00:57:56,005 --> 00:58:01,466
Red hot passion

539
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:06,946
I leave you to yourself

540
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:13,555
Don't torment me

541
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:16,551
Your words hold no water

542
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:19,960
You may try as hard as you please

543
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:24,963
I won't get taken in

544
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:04,500
We've found solitude in solitude

545
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:10,178
what's the point?

546
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:17,348
You are so graceful

547
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:22,488
Angels too would lose control

548
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,526
You don't lose control

549
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:28,960
Be a little patient

550
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:32,200
My heart is not in my hands

551
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:35,433
How long will I have to wait?

552
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:40,169
Don't torment me

553
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:46,980
Play these tricks elsewhere

554
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:28,946
"So you're leaving?
- No, coming"

555
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,190
On behalf of the
managing committee...

556
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,560
I'd like to know how
you found the hotel

557
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:39,625
"Sure, write"

558
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:45,503
And room service?

559
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,670
Excellent

560
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,506
And the beds?
- Comfortable

561
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,320
The food?
- Very tasty. Isn't it?

562
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,658
We liked everything.
- There was no problem

563
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:11,399
Anything you didn't like?

564
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,526
Anything...?
- You!

565
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,977
What are you upto?

566
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:00,639
I'm mad about you

567
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:07,420
Enough. I'm still alive

568
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:14,986
I'm not so evil
and I'm still waiting

569
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:16,996
Stop raving

570
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:20,434
"If I wanted,
I could've killed him"

571
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:22,937
"He isn't human,
he's a beast"

572
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:25,436
Stop the car

573
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:27,933
I won't.
- You won't?

574
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,703
No. What will you do?

575
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:36,174
Want to shoot?
- Stop the car

576
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:39,452
"No Arvind...
- Go on, shoot"

577
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:42,423
Pulling a gun on a girl?

578
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:45,291
"Go on, shoot! Coward!
Shoot! What are you waiting for?"

579
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:56,437
"You want to let him kill you?
Instead, let me kill you"

580
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:01,973
Put that gun down.
I'm stopping

581
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,573
"Put the gun away,
I'm stopping"

582
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,408
I'm stopping

583
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:12,648
Out... out
