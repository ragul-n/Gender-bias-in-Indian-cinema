1
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,102
Sarbjit.

2
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,840
Sarbjit

3
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,144
Sarbjit.

4
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,310
Sarbjit.

5
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,319
Brother

6
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,843
Sarbjit.

7
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,818
Brother
- Sarbjit.

8
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,085
Brother...

9
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,759
Sarbjit...

10
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,195
Any clue?

11
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,325
We were very drunk sister

12
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,393
But I swear, I remember
he said he was going home...

13
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,163
If Sarbjit had left for home,
shouldn't he have reached by now?!

14
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,674
Stop wasting time and
go find my brother!

15
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,202
Sarbjit... Sarbjit...
- Yes.

16
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,341
Sarbjit...

17
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,120
Brother...

18
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:03,814
My brother,
have you seen him anywhere?

19
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,253
No, we haven't seen him...sorry

20
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,757
Call someone else and see

21
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,160
Sarbjit...

22
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,330
Stop here...

23
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,388
Stop stop STOP

24
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,929
I think its him

25
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,331
Sarbjit is that you?

26
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,667
Hey, who are you?

27
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,173
Get lost... let me sleep...

28
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,731

S it him?...

29
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,175
Where is my brother?

30
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,178
Brother...

31
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,405
I've looked in all neighboring
fields and villages.

32
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,208
Even called our friends.

33
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,447
No clue at all.

34
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,956
He's never had enemies either.

35
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,321
What next now, sister?

36
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,689
But what's the harm in lodging
a First Investigation Report ?

37
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,887
Relax Dalbir...
It's only been 5 days...

38
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,793
That's exactly what
I've been trying to say.

39
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,730
These young men who
live near the Borders...

40
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,790
Their not interested in farming anymore...

41
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,928
Spying and smuggling
Excites them instead.

42
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,404
Sarbjifs not one of them.

43
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,429
He's responsible. He's a family man.

44
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,943
Madam...these so-called family-men...

45
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,808
They're the ones who flee first.

46
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,211
And why am I am
explaining this to you?

47
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,841
Hasn't your relationship with your husband
been through something similar?

48
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,909
Sardarji...you've known
Sarbjit since he was a kid.

49
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,188
All this is beyond
their reach and knowledge.

50
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,950
For the sake of these kids help us...

51
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,353
How... how can we help with this?

52
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,329
I am sure he's got a mistress
in one of the neighboring villages.

53
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,229
Aunty...please you don't analyze.

54
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,825
Why? Have I offended you?

55
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,237
You've no one to look forward to.

56
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,830
At least let your
brother's family flourish...

57
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,908
Let's go, sister.

58
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:36,247
‘You've no one to look forward to.‘

59
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,816
‘At least let your brother
settle down happily.‘

60
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,218
Hey they are here...

61
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:46,247
Brother in law,
Mandev and Sister Dalbir are here...

62
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:50,887
Hey, Dalbir. Bless you.

63
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,327
Heard the good news. Many congrats...

64
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,959
Congrats, Mandev.

65
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,997
Got this good news after 6 years.
I bet you will have a baby boy.

66
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:02,268
Absolutely. - Dance everyone.
My prayer is heard.

67
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:06,776
Where's Dalbir?

68
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,040
Look for Sarbjit
and you will find Dalbir.

69
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:20,286
"Celebrations taken over my mind...
I've lost myself to this joy...

70
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:23,851
"The tune of love staned
resonating in my heart..."

71
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:27,023
"
 like this excitement within..."

72
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:30,534
"
 think I am in 
ove."

73
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:35,336
"My hean tells me
to cross all limits today."

74
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,800
"
've lost myself to this joy...."

75
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,443
"
 lost my heart..."

76
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,565
"
f you say yes to me...
like your nose ring..."

77
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,340
"...or the button on your top."

78
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:12,002
"l'll always be with you, beloved."

79
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,076
"Why...do you tease girls?"

80
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,105
"Don't follow me around."

81
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,546
"
 will repon you."

82
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:26,524
"My head's crazy about your beauty."

83
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,595
"
've lost myself to this joy...."

84
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,125
"
've lost myself to this joy...."

85
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,137
"
 lost my heart..."

86
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,981
"We've been blessed with this
happiness after a long time."

87
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,357
"The auspicious night has arrived,
I can hear the drums resonating."

88
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,556
"Come on, beat those drums harder."

89
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:10,465
"Shed all your inhibitions...
and shake that waist."

90
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,135
"
 am so h8PPY---
so-so haPPY"

91
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:20,378
"Happiness has graced our home."

92
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,548
"
'm dancing...so are my friends."

93
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,553
"She's dancing up a storm."

94
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:33,614
"Let's all have a blast."

95
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,622
"
've lost myself to this joy...."

96
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,628
"
 lost my heart..."

97
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,199
"
've lost myself to this joy...."

98
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,075
"
 lost my heart..."

99
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,709
There's no life left.

100
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,483
She's dead...

101
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,724
Hand her over to me, Dalbir.

102
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,641
Hand her.

103
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,236
Hand her to him.

104
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,583
Go, my child.

105
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,815
Almighty will make things right.

106
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,251
Don't worry

107
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,126
This counyard will soon
have a kid playing in it.

108
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,561
Almighty will soon bless
you both with parenthood again...

109
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,302
She's already a mother, to him.

110
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,638
I'm the one left abandoned.

111
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,310
Stop! Dalbir!

112
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,122
Don't be a lunatic.
- I'll have to leave at any cost.

113
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,818
My brother's in the hospital.

114
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,717
He's got severe jaundice.

115
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,262
Why don't you understand?
- Yes I cannot understand!!!

116
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,595
You are incessantly praying...
Fasting like crazy for him.

117
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,124
Doesn't he has a family
to look after him?

118
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,603
Still you want to leave
your house and family for him?

119
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,636
He's my only brother.

120
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,266
He's almighty's boon to me.

121
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,138
I've literally raised him.

122
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,644
Nothing can change my mind.

123
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,611
Let go my hand.

124
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:46,683
If today I let go of your hand...
then I will never ever hold it again

125
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,266
Come on everyone...
please stop working.

126
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,802
There's going to be a curfew.

127
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:06,860
Stop work please

128
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:08,662
Madam...

129
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,140
Madam...there's going to be a curfew.

130
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,198
Everyone's going home.

131
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,872
If you don't leave now,
you'll miss the bus.

132
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,239
By the way...you cou
d've
taken another week off.

133
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:22,251
Don't worry...Sarbjit will be found.

134
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,788
‘Only God has the answers
to cenain questions."

135
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,148
‘Tomorrow morning, a procession will
be leaving for the Golden temple.‘

136
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,387
You should go to.
Maybe your prayers will be heard."

137
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:42,705
"The tears in my eyes..."

138
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,939
"...have all dried up."

139
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:55,852
"My abode's empty, since
you're not here."

140
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,664
"O Lord...bring him back again."

141
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,294
"The one that's lost."

142
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:16,431
"O Lord...bring him back again."

143
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:20,444
"The season of colors seem faded."

144
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,242
"The tears in my eyes have dried up."

145
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:28,377
"Who strummed those strings."

146
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,216
"The lanes are completely drenched."

147
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,780
"Obstructions on the road."

148
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:38,693
"Stop my feet from marching ahead."

149
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:43,358
"Bring back those bonds
that slipped through my hands."

150
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,959
"O Lord...bring him back again."

151
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,762
"The one that's lost."

152
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:53,869
"O Lord...bring him back again."

153
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,504
"O Lord...bring him back again."

154
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,307
"The one that's lost."

155
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:04,514
"O Lord...bring him back again."

156
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:08,248
"O Lord...bring him back again."

157
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:15,356
"O Lord." -"O Lord...bring
him back again."

158
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:20,997
"O Lord...bring him back again."

159
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:25,874
"O Lord...bring him back again."

160
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,867
Pakistan!

161
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,610
Letter! Letter! Letter! Letter!

162
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,448
Give me the letter.

163
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,782
The postman came in the afternoon.

164
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,587
With a letter for
someone from Pakistan.

165
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,491
Without Name, I didn't touch it.

166
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,961
Since then she's been
ranting letter! Letterl...

167
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,496
Where are you going?

168
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,967
The Post Office must
have closed by now!

169
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,968
Uncle!

170
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,842
Uncle!
- What's the problem, dear?

171
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:06,508
Uncle...l'll be really
grateful to you

172
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,843
Someone sent a bearer
letter for us from Pakistan.

173
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,411
Please give it to me

174
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,018
Hold on.

175
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:17,860
Yes...here it is.

176
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,463
Sarbjit...

177
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,851
"28th August, 1990."

178
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,892
"
n the past eight months..."

179
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,489
"...
've lived that
Particular day 8000 times."

180
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,562
Oh!!! You...

181
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:06,570
Why don't you take my picture when
lam in a nice pose.

182
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,540
When I'm decked up.

183
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,472
Sukh, my sweetheart...

184
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,815
You just have to put some
Lipstick on to look beautiful...

185
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:19,788
Sukh...Baby Nikki wet the bed again..
- Coming.

186
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,792
Come fast, my child.

187
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,051
My child...

188
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,930
My sweet darling.

189
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,900
Aunt.
- Grandpa, wear your specs.

190
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,027
Come on...stop fooling around.

191
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,594
Look after your daughter Swapan,
I've to get to the office.

192
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,604
Take the camera.

193
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,797
And click a family photo.

194
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,607
Nikki.
- Take this.

195
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,936
Useless...don't you

196
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,574
My wrestling tournament's next week...

197
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,813
Yeah...a

 you're going
to do is fool around.

198
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,144
Hey...

199
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:52,648
You wait and watch

200
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,986
The entire village will
raise me up on their shoulders and...

201
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,719
Everyone will salute me.

202
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,955
And not just my wife...

203
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,622
...but people will also address
you by my name.

204
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,667
Look there comes Sarbjifs sister...

205
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,669
Look there comes Sarbjifs sister

206
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:06,635
Let it be.

207
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,661
Come on, drop me to the office,
I am getting late.

208
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,638
Come on.
- One photo...

209
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,697
Office.

210
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:12,104
Office.

211
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,974
Take Swapan along too, for a ride.

212
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:18,676
Come on, dear...
we're going to play office-office.

213
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,740
Come on...go with daddy.

214
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,547
Return soon after dropping me.

215
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:26,818
Sukh ...make bitter
gourd for lunch today.

216
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,159
Defeat him.

217
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:41,994
Come here.

218
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,772
Hey you Sarbjit!

219
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:50,575
You don't remember anything
else when it comes to wrestling.

220
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,708
Come home today...
I won't spare you.

221
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,148
Wait!

222
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:56,585
You're in big trouble.

223
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,644
Shame on you.

224
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,019
The apple of your eye...

225
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,114
...is sitting outside
without anything to eat.

226
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,051
Sukh's an outsider...

227
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,193
...but Dalbir you are my sister.

228
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,595
Come on ladies... Open the door.

229
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,136
Sarbjit Singh Attwars
not going to climb the wall...

230
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,196
Don't even think about it.

231
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,200
No one will dare open the door.

232
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,737
Do we look like fools to you...

233
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,007
I'll count till 10...

234
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,776
After that I won't
come even if you beg me to.

235
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,611
Sukh...Hope you are listening?

236
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,187
You'll have to raise
both the kids alone.

237
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,223
Yes...don't worry.

238
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,716
I won't give you a reason to complain.

239
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:35,885
Exactly.

240
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,757
Stay out there.

241
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:41,026
You're all going to regret this.
I mean it.

242
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,791
One...

243
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:43,924
Two...

244
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,626
Three...

245
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,169
Four...

246
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:51,231
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!
Get lost.

247
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,003
Fine...

248
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,841
Remember...
 am going.

249
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:01,777
Okay...
ove to everyone else.

250
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:06,119
And to the e
ders...goodbye!
- Look, sister.

251
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,216
Shameless, you're in trouble now.

252
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,924
Keep some bitter gourds for me.

253
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,191
Go to hell.

254
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,666
Let me sleep you rascal.

255
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,903
I must go home.

256
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:31,209
If Dalbir doesn't
see me in the morning...

257
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,978
...then she'll clobber you for good.

258
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,677
Fine.

259
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,709
Let me sleep now.

260
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,147
You get the scooter.

261
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:30,063
Sarbjit...you're out of fuel.

262
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,332
So what?

263
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,109
Let's fill some.

264
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,824
Instead lets fill the full tank.

265
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:05,968
"Hail Lord Shankar."

266
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:09,036
"Saves you from every trouble."

267
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:12,981
"
 drink in thy name."

268
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,114
"
 swear.

269
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,902
"Hail Lord Shankar."

270
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,039
"Saves you from every trouble."

271
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:47,340
"
 drink in thy name."

272
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,080
Who are you?
- Who are you?

273
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:51,184
Come on.

274
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,347
You're here to spy on us.

275
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,358
What are you doing
in the middle of the night?

276
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,156
I haven't done any1hing.

277
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,093
Catch him.

278
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,990
Take him. Come on.

279
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,997
It took me 3 days to understand

280
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,074
that I had left for home..

281
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,068
but had reached Lahore.

282
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,844
Same language.
Same type of dressing.

283
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,006
Even their faces are same.

284
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:20,942
They seemed to be one of us.

285
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:25,282
I don't understand
why they are so angry with me.

286
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,454
ls anyone listening?

287
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,284
I haven't done any1hing!

288
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:07,093
You've got the wrong man!

289
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:29,379
Do you remember your name now?

290
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,180
You're Ranjit Singh,
aren't you?

291
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,185
I am Sarbjit!

292

I am Sarbjit!

293
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,191
Let me go.

294
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,265
Sir, I haven't done any1hing.

295
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,470
You've got the wrong man...

296
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,032
‘A lot happened...‘

297
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,432
‘Whether it happened
for days...or months...‘

298
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,666
'...

299
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,139
‘Neither do I want

I haven't done any1hing.

304
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,366
Forgive me for God sake.

305
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,963
You're Ranjit Singh, aren't you?
- No, sir.

you were behind those five
bomb blasts, weren't you! - No, sir...

307
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,208
There were so many casualties.

How can we forgive you?
- I haven't done any1hing.

309

Listen...

00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,482
It should help him remember better.

311
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,278
Lift him up...

312
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,155
String him up... he knows every1hing.

313
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,991
Hit him.

314
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,212
I haven't done any1hing.

315
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,409
Did you remember your name now?

316
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,241
You're Ranjit Singh, aren't you?

317

Now read this.

319
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,491
I can't read Urdu, sir.

320
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:33,223
Repeat after me...whi
e
looking into the camera.

321
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,062
My name's Ranjit Singh!

322
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:38,426
My name's Ranjit Singh!

323
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,060
‘I shouldn't have said it.‘

324
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,128
‘But their were others
and their screams.‘

325
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:44,367
'..are still echoing in my ears.‘

326
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,373
‘I gave up in just eight months.‘

327
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,779
‘No one is more helpless
than a scared guy‘

328
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:53,549
Where are you from?

329
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,141
India.

330
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,185
On what charges?

331
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,519
I don't know.
- And your family?

332
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,151
They've no clue.

333
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,717
He doesn't even know.

334
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:10,089
Come on... you've to be
present at the coun today.

335
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,432
There will be justice today.

336

I will try..

337
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:30,718
..my best.

338
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,618
Keep moving.
- Every1hing will be fine, don't worry.

339
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,118
Ma‘! 90d bless!

340
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:37,854
I've been accused
of killing her mother.

341
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,180
‘I came across a
few kind people here...‘

342
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,195
‘I don't know when
my next hearing is...‘

343
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:20,636
‘Hopefully before this letter reaches you...
I should return home as a free man...‘

344
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:26,733
‘I could never imagine,
Pakistan is so far from home...‘

345
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,209
‘And to return from
there was so tough‘

346
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,472
‘But you don't worry...‘

347
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,549
'Everyone's lending a
helping hand in our village‘

348
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,579
‘We are in talk with
supreme police officials‘

349
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,352
Trying to understand,
who is this "Ranjit Singh"...

350
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,547
And why should you
pay for his evil deed

351
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,719
Sister...
 was coming to see you.

352
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,355
Just like the rest,
this letter was returned too.

353
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,230
Returned?

354
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:07,508
Aunty, they're showing
Sarbjit on the television.

355
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:09,351
Sarbjit.

356
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,722
The government is planning

357
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,617
What were they saying?
Was he released?

358
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,522
Sister, He was laughing.
Looking brave as ever.

359
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:20,586
Every1hing was written in Urdu.

360
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,394
Was he hum?

361
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:26,469
Don't worry...they'

 re-telecast it.

362
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,699
Don't worry, sit down.
Come, sit.

363
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:31,397
I'm leaving.

364
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,711
Why did you deny?

365
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:37,576
Sister.

366
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,671
I will set the TV here.

367
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,349
You, sit here and watch.
- Okay.

368
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:02,467
What happened, Maqsood?

369
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,500
My grandpa gets the Urdu
Newspapers from there

370
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,652
What are they saying in here?

371
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:17,446
Did they release him?

372
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,049
Tell me...

373
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,353
What's written?

374
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:23,755
Tell me what's written here?

375
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,556
Ranjit Singh
been sentenced to death.

376
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:26,652
Huh!

377
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,330
No!

378
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:40,669
Death Sentence to Ranjit Singh Mattu...
not Sarbjit.

379
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:49,752
Ranjit Singh Mattu...not Sarbjit.

380
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,451
Ranjit Singh..

381
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,561
Not Sarbjit.

382
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:15,803
Where have you been?

383
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,609
We were so worried all night.

384
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,842
The Wall's collapsed.

385
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:21,612
This one's got fever.

386
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:23,516
I'm not that young anymore...

387
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:24,710
...nor do I have any courage left.

388
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,390
Have mercy on me, dear.

389
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,858
Have mercy on me.

390
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,651
Who's this?

391
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,662
Can you read Urdu, father?

392
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:42,497
What's this nonsense?

393
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:45,132
Sarbjifs photo?
‘Sentenced to Death‘

394
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,437
Indian terrorist Ranjit Singh's
been sentenced...

395
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:53,876
..to death for conducting
5 bomb blasts in Pakistan.

396
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,813
But he's my Sarbjit.

397
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:02,157
Supreme coun has announced,
sentence to death.

398
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,425
This is not possible.

399
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,658
What nonsense is this?

400
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,859
The date for the death penalty is..

401
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,433
..yet not finalized in this case.

402
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:25,404
Lawyer of the accused is Mr. Abdulla Hasan.

403
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:32,487
They've only announced
the punishment... not the date yet.

404
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,885
You can still stop thisl!

405
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,823
I am helpless, father.

406
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:38,890
Your are witnessing everything...

407
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:43,764
His wife, his daughters...his house...

408
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,929
Even/thing's shattering to ground...

409
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,468
...and there's nothing I can do.

410
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:55,968
As kids if I ever beat him...
you used to confront me

411
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,944
You would go against the
whole village just to protect him.

412
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:00,673
You can do it.

413
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,215
You'll bring him back home.

414
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,549
This problem is way bigger
than what my courage can handle.

415
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:09,748
very big.

416
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:17,832
Undaunted courage can conquer
every obstacle in its way, dear.

417
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:22,666
Don't worry about us at all.

418
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:24,972
My pension will suppon us.

419
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,971
Just...bring my son back home please.

420
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,042
Father...

421
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,480
Father...

422
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:11,753
Come on...get going. Keep moving.

423
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,015
Madam...

424
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,720
Madam, how much longer are you going
to keep running after these ministers?

425
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,552
I've explained you before.

426
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:22,957
Sarbjifs stuck in a false case...

427
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:24,897
That too in Pakistan.

428
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:28,903
These low-level ministers
and MLAs can't help you.

429
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,798
This is a PM level issue.
Understand.

430
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:41,706
Roti.

431
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,542
Here, son.

432
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,619
Roti...

433
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,122
Ranjit!

434
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:52,753
Ranjit!

435
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,758
Sarbjit.

436
00:35:56,955 --> 00:36:02,064
Why are you people obsessed
with seeing me hanged <i>as</i> Ranjit?

437
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,575
Stay Ranjit for today.

438
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,873
Here...

439
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,770
Eat your roti.

440
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,110
Roti!

441
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:15,015
Roti!

442
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,670
‘I can hardly sleep."

443
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:16,369
‘Then I think maybe
you're awake as well."

444
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:21,375
‘And I keep thinking
about you till it's dawn.‘

445
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:55,916
‘Whether I live through this,
or I don't.‘

446
00:37:56,141 --> 00:38:02,990
"
 wish that our love stays intact."

447
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:11,762
"Whether the earth
or sky exists or not."

448
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:18,235
‘I wish that our love stays intact.‘

449
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:40,260
"
 am afraid of losing you."

450
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:44,265
"
f I ever meet God,
I will say to him."

451
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,997
"
 don't want the two worlds."

452
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:51,233
"Tell me.."

453
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:56,142
"Since you're with me."

454
00:38:56,735 --> 00:39:00,273
"
 have no desires."

455
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:07,121
"My prayers have been answered."

456
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:15,095
"Whether the moon
keeps shining or not."

457
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:22,836
"
 wish that our love stays intact."

458
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,210
I want to meet the Prime Minister.

459
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,904
I've explained you
so many times before...

460
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,243
...yet you keep coming back every day.

461
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,304
Please leave.

462
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:36,319
But...
- Madam...it's not possible.

463
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,149
Why not?

464
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,881
He's the Prime Minister
of the country.

465
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,150
Why can't he meet his own people?

466
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:44,523
He can...but first you
must take an appointment.

467
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:45,557
Appointment?

468
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,951
H ow?

469
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,157
Do one thing.

470
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:49,994
There's a small shop on the corner.

471
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:52,058
Buy a small telephone
directory from there.

472
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:55,001
It's got numbers of all the
ministers and their secretaries.

473
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,937
Call them...

474
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:52,890
Dear.

475
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,953
Greetings.
- Greetings.

476
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,994
How long are you going to stay here,
away from your family?

477
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:01,963
As long as I don't get an appointment?

478
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:05,030
Getting an appointment
could also take months.

479
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,304
This is like a battle,
it won't end in a day or two.

480
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,077
Think about it.

481
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,109
Vahe Guru.

482
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,330
He's in a parliament
session at this hour

483
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,075
Get up. Get up.

484
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,272
PM's gone on a foreign tour

485
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:49,977
Please call on the 23rd of August,
afternoon 2pm

486
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:52,016
‘I've been sentenced to death...‘

487
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,113
'...but the date's
not been fixed yet.‘

488
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:58,424
‘Although the wait is
enough to kill a man.‘

489
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,059
‘Here when they want to
play with someone's peace of mind...

490
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:05,260
...they give them a little happiness.

491
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:10,468
Neither is it dark
here...nor is it lonely.

492
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:14,136
You can also see the
moon through the window

493
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:19,072
Waiting for the moon has made me
realize that 6 more months have passed.

494
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:24,350
I see my little Nikki's face
In the full moon.

495
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:29,690
May God bless you with His grace,
my sister!

496
00:42:30,448 --> 00:42:31,483
What happened?

497
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:56,317
Please, sit.

498
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,315
"We'll see what we can do."

499
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,285
That's it.

500
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,696
It took 8 months
to get an appointment.

501
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,326
And the meeting lasted
for only 3 minutes.

502
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:15,501
And they say "We'll
see what we can do."?

503
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,370
That's the limit of patience.

504
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:21,238
Father, they said they'll
see what they can do.

505
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,470
That means they will do something.

506
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:25,640
Right, sister?

507
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,484
And now...?

508
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,010
Say something.

509
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:36,321
These clothes were
Rotting in the suitcases.

510
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,424
Can't buy new clothes for Girls...

511
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,525
I thought I'll at least
stitch them something beautiful.

512
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,537
Stop it!

513
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:53,774
Stop it!

514
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,783
We'll call the young one Poonam.

515
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,389
Poonam.

516
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,524
'Poonam.'

517
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:20,562
‘my hean is filled with immense joy knowing
you've named the young one Poonam.‘

518
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:33,406
‘This joy gives me strength
to endure the fact...‘

519
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,417
'...that I've been thrown into
solitude by the new Superintendent.‘

520
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:43,383
‘With Indians and especially
me he has special hatred.‘

521
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:50,122
‘Few pages from your
last letter were missing.‘

522
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:55,332
‘I wonder if I'll
get anymore letters from you.‘

523
00:45:27,692 --> 00:45:31,799
Have a read, you'll find
peace... its written in Hindi

524
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:34,641
Allah is with kind people,

525
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,571
Allah believes in Kindness,

526
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,406
One who helps others,
Allah is with him,

527
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,481
Allah believes in Humanity

528
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:45,617
Uncle...

529
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,581
Give these to Ranjit.

530
00:45:47,645 --> 00:45:50,387
You know... from where
you entered Pakistan...

531
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,452
...they've put up
a border there now...

532
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:56,158
I wished they had thought
of this 3 years back...

533
00:45:57,655 --> 00:45:59,692
‘I was never able
to stay alone at home...‘

534
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,896
'...even when you guys
went to the market.‘

535
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:09,711
‘And now... far from my actual life...
spent so many years alone‘

536
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:12,637
‘My daughters must
be going to school now.‘

537
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:15,515
‘I don't even know
how they must look.‘

538
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,687
‘Do they look more like Sukh...or me?‘

539
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:25,726
' My Sukh, my beloved... Don't forget
to deck yourself up for my sake.‘

540
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,784
Can I take this?

541
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,523
What's all that noise?

542
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,867
Today is the festival
of 'Diwa
i', dear.

543
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:38,229
On this day we burst
crackers...eat sweets...

544
00:46:38,696 --> 00:46:41,939
...wear nice clothes
and visit our kin.

545
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:43,568
Us too?

546
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:45,679
Yes, we too.

547
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,210
Grandpa... Grandpa.

548
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:52,220
We'll burst crackers...
and eat sweets.

549
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:54,882
Wow, red bangles.
It looks very pretty.

550
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:56,524
Father!

551
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:57,491
Mother!

552
00:46:57,515 --> 00:46:58,459
Father!

553
00:46:58,583 --> 00:46:59,618
Father!

554
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:02,998
Father!

555
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,747
PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee has announced

556
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:25,011
That India Has tested 3 Nuclear
blasts at Pokhran in Rajasthan,

557
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,580
Pakistan tested 6
Nuclear blasts yesterday...

558
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:32,818
...their PM says that this is their
reply to 
ndia?s 5 Nuclear tests...

559
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,521
due to this,
situation at LOC has tensed up...

560
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,725
...both nation have
staned bombardment...

561
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,632
India and Pakistan are at war,
at Kargil sector Of Jammu and Kashmir.

562
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,821
Amazing, sir.

563
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,863
It seems the date of my
Hanging has been fixed?

564
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:16,670
Guess you'll bathe me,
clean me before releasing from this life.

565
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:19,765
Today is the festival of Eld.
- So was it last year.

566
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:22,333
And a year before that too.

567
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:25,040
But what has changed for me.

568
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,844
Don't be a philosopher, Ranjit.

569
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:29,314
The Superintendent's
in a merry mood today.

570
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:34,649
Will you fulfill one request?
- Go ahead.

571
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,593
The last picture my family
saw of me was 10 years ago.

572
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,861
And in the past three years
we haven't even exchanged letters.

573
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,967
Please send a picture
of me to my family.

574
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,335
At least they'll know that I am alive.

575
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:06,817
Morning 11:29 AM,
Parliament faced firing...

576
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:11,053
terrorist entered the
parliament and opened fire...

577
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,395
After the parliament attack
they have made our lives difficult

578
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,693
Let us go atleast...
we are regular visitors.

579
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:17,733
Please let us go...
we come here often

580
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:18,630
Listen to me, sir.

581
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:21,369
Sir. Sir.

582
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:22,997
CM sir.

583
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,004
Let me meet him.

584
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:29,410
CM sir.
- Stay back.

585
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:31,946
CM sir.

586
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,980
This is Dalbir.
Sarbjifs sister.

587
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:36,643
Who's she?

588
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:38,918
Go back.
- Listen to me, sir.

589
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,989
I want to speak to him.

590
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:43,882
CM sir.

591
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,822
What are you doing? I know her.

592
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:48,726
Sir...

593
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,823
CM sir.
- It's okay...it's alright.

594
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:56,396
CM sir.

595
00:49:57,762 --> 00:49:58,832
Mr. Kalra...

596
00:50:00,898 --> 00:50:06,075
Mr. Ka
ra...
 wanted to give the
New Chief Minister the PM's letter.

597
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,650
Sister this letter
is many years old now...

598
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,414
Many CMs and political
Panies came in power...and left.

599
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:14,418
The country has bigger
issues to deal with.

600
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:17,448
I may not be as
imponant as the country.

601
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:19,158
And I may only have
one issue to discuss.

602
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,420
But that issue is my only brother.

603
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,793
The new CM will have to listen to me.

604
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:26,931
After all he's the innocent
kid of this very country .

605
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:28,061
Innocent!

606
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:31,029
He's a terrorist. A terrorist.

607
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:35,666
Your brother has humiliated
us in the eyes of Pakistan.

608
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,473
We can't point fingers
at them anymore.

609
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,978
Your brother has brought
shame upon our country.

610
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,709
Take a look.

611
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,853
And take her away from my sight.

612
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,995
We won't move from here.

613
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:08,900
We won't move from here.

614
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,030
We won't move from here.

615
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,573
We won't move from here.

616
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:15,801
We won't move from here.

617
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:21,073
We won't move from here.

618
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:30,019
Yes, madam.

619
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,184
They just published
that he's a terrorist.

620
00:52:34,218 --> 00:52:37,028
Humiliated his family.

621
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,831
Just once...

622
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:42,901
You cou
d've asked us the truth once.

623
00:52:44,562 --> 00:52:46,599
See...testimony from six people.

624
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,035
Read it carefully.

625
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:49,807
See.

626
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,113
He's a responsible guy, a family-man.

627
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,340
He's got a family.

628
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:59,847
Since 12 years Innocent
Sarbjit is In Pakistan Jail...

629
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,984
...and here his Family is
going through extreme difficulties...

630
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:05,049
In a small village of Punjab,
in India...

631
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:07,095
...a family is on fast unto death.

632
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:08,960
For Sarbjit Singh, a simple farmer..

633
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,930
..who has been incarcerated.

634
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:12,932
..in a Pakistani Jail.

635
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:16,062
Small village in Punjab,
Bhikhiwind has come together as one.

636
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,267
Sarbjit Singh from Bhikhiwind, Amritsar
announced sentenced to death.

637
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:27,111
..by the supreme coun of Pakistan.
It's case of wrong condemnation.

638
00:53:27,138 --> 00:53:28,879
That man is rotting in jail.

639
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:33,150
But unfortunately our government
isn't concerned about him at all.

640
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:34,621
Sister 'Da
bir!

641
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,084
Sister Dalbir!

642
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,251
You've a call from Canada.

643
00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:40,152
Canada?
- Yes?

644
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:41,056
Who? Why?

645
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:42,256
It's the Human Rights people.

646
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,299
They say they can
do something for you.

647
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:45,891
Talk to them.

648
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,368
Yes...

649
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:54,907
Hello.

650
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:58,646
Yes, brother.

651
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,647
Yes, it's me.

652
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:06,176
You'll go to meet him?

653
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,952
You'll go meet Sarbjit?

654
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,923
They're going to meet him.

655
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,319
Make some light.

656
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,431
I've already given orders
to take the chains off.

657
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,458
Take them off.

658
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,465
And empty that.

659
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,961
And do it daily.

660
00:54:58,095 --> 00:54:59,472
Or we'll lose all foreign aid.

661
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:21,158
Things wont be like they were before.

662
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,329
Have faith in God.

663
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:27,993
Indian?

664
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:30,466
No. I am Pakistani.

665
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:33,970
But all humans are same to me.

666
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:35,301
lshwar Singh.

667
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,374
Your family has sent these.

668
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,816
You all can't go up...

669
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,145
You don't worry,
I'll take care of the speech

670
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,057
Brothers and Sisters, numerous
innocent Indians since 1971

671
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:02,097
...are locked in Pakistani Jails...

672
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:05,231
And our government is
doing nothing about this...

673
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:07,291
Since past many years...

674
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:10,861
...young sons of our country
return as dead bodies from Pakistan...

675
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,405
But our Government hasn't
raised this issue with them...

676
00:57:13,497 --> 00:57:15,340
Aunt feels so distant from us...

677
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:18,141
So many innocent cross
the border unknowingly...

678
00:57:18,202 --> 00:57:21,308
And spend rest of their lives in
solitary confinement in theirjails...

679
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:23,576
But our government
hasn't raised this issue...

680
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,251
Because this government is Dumb

681
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:27,084
Mr. Dhillon, say something about Sarbjit

682
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:33,392
Our party will not allow any sister of
this country to cry out of desperation

683
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,554
Please applaud...

684
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,394
Come sister... come.
- But Sarbjit.

685
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:42,367
I want to say few
words for Sarbjiﬂs sake...

686
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:54,146
Its written In the Quran...

687
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:59,645
That Punishing an innocent...
or killing an innocent

688
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,289
ls killing the whole of humanity

689
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:06,550
I Trust all Allah's followers...

690
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,192
And I have trust...

691
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:12,397
In President Of
Pakistan Brother Ashraf

692
00:58:12,423 --> 00:58:14,425
That he's a true Muslim...

693
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,431
And my Sarbjit is Innocent

694
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,375
He'll never be sentenced to death...

695
00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:24,639
He will return back home...

696
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:26,937
With all integrity he'll return...

697
00:58:27,404 --> 00:58:30,351
All accusations on him are false...

698
00:58:32,276 --> 00:58:33,550
He's the son of this country

699
00:58:33,644 --> 00:58:35,646
He's your brother...

700
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:38,256
I am not the only one fighting for him

701
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,422
I am well aware...

702
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:46,560
that every brother and every sister
of my country is with me in this fight...

703
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:50,297
Everyone should
sign his release petition

704
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:55,433
This injustice with him
will not continue any further...

705
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:58,941
Please raise your voice for Sarbjit

706
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:01,545
And raise it so loud

707
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:06,178
That it reaches every
Pakistanis hean...

708
00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:07,444
Long Live India...

709
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:13,290
The President of Pakistan, Mr. Ashraf in his
efforts towards a better India Pakistan relation...

710
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:17,992
...has decided to release a Indian
inmate rotting in Pakistani jail...

711
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:21,726
...for the last 35 years,
whose name is Sardar Singh.

712
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:23,300
My name is Sardar Singh.

713
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,365
Sardar Singh, can you please
tell us that 35 years ago...

714
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:29,433
...how did you cross the Indian
border and reach Pakistan?

715
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:32,377
I was a spy in Pakistan.

716
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:37,243
After his statement, the situation
in Pakistan is quite critical.

717
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,713
Look at the consequences
of doing a good deed towards them.

718
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:43,014
He claimed to be innocent,
but turned out to be a spy after all.

719
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,749
They are all spies, throw them out.

720
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:48,656
Sarbjit is my father's murderer.

721
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:51,630
He ruined our lives.

722
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:55,595
If he's released,
then we'll kill ourselves.

723
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:57,433
We'll kill ourselves.

724
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:03,336
Dear, today is about celebrations.

725
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:05,010
Anyway... Son, get your computer.

726
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:07,674
Show your aunt what
mail she wants to see.

727
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:10,477
Show me, son.

728
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,291
Hello.

729
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:24,662
Sister, are you watching the news.
- No I am not Around a television.

730
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:26,666
Wonder what the news is!
But you please watch.

731
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:27,691
What?

732
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,306
You Please raise
the volume of your Set.

733
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,770
President Ashraf shattered...

734
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:38,343
...the hopes and wait of Indian
prisoner Sarbjifs family.

735
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:43,283
Considering the current situation in Pakistan,
President Ashraf has taken an important decision...

736
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:47,686
...that has shattered all expectations
of Sarbjifs long wait and hopes.

737
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:51,621
Sarbjit, who's been in
Pakistani jail for 18 years...

738
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:57,597
...his death sentence will be carried
out 30 days from now, on 1st May.

739
01:01:22,379 --> 01:01:23,756
You're his lawyer.

740
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:26,123
How can you give up?

741
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:29,495
All I've been hearing are arguments,
excuses and regrets.

742
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,361
But no one's putting in any effon.

743
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,829
We still have 15 more days,
Mr. Abdullah.

744
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,371
If there's nothing you can do...

745
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:39,465
...then at least get us the visas.

746
01:01:39,563 --> 01:01:43,340
We four women, we shall fight
with your government for justice.

747
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:47,709
Otherwise I am warning you... the same day
he is hung we'll also hang ourselves...

748
01:01:50,574 --> 01:01:51,882
Poonam, have you lost your mind?

749
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:53,485
He's our father.
- No!

750
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,682
What are you doing?
- He's not our father!

751
01:01:55,779 --> 01:01:56,780
Are you mad?
- He's not our father!

752
01:01:56,847 --> 01:01:58,849
I am tired of trying
to find my father...

753
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:00,595
...in these old rags and pictures.

754
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:03,655
At least you have memories of him.

755
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,733
I don't even have a
single picture with him.

756
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:09,561
What was supposed to happen
15 days 
ater...
 did it right now.

757
01:02:09,793 --> 01:02:11,136
His final rites.

758
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:14,870
Stop it, aunt. Stop it!

759
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:16,634
Nothings over dear.
- Stop it.

760
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,441
I won't let him die.

761
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,709
Don't force us to lead
this incomplete life, live in denial

762
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:22,740
My mom's not even a complete widow.

763
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:25,480
Let her peacefully mourn for
her husband for once and move on.

764
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:28,822
You couldn't hold onto
your husband and family.

765
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:31,926
But please spare our
family from this tenure.

766
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,162
Please set our family free.

767
01:02:36,887 --> 01:02:39,891
Poonam, see we do have a picture.

768
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:44,398
Look at this. There's
a picture of you with him.

769
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:47,803
Don't cry, my child.

770
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:28,845
We still have 15 days!

771
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:36,489
What happened?

772
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,723
There's some jam up ahead, sir.

773
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,536
Once they stamp your passpon...
you can enter Pakistan.

774
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:57,868
That's it.

775
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,749
That's it!
But this stamp took 18 years.

776
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,778
Here...it's stamped.

777
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:14,991
Listen Da
bir...we couldn't
be together, but that's fine.

778
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:17,525
relations don't break so easily.

779
01:04:17,788 --> 01:04:19,995
Sarbjit grew up right before my eyes.

780
01:04:20,757 --> 01:04:22,828
I couldn't let his
daughters come alone.

781
01:04:52,823 --> 01:04:53,893
Come.

782
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:56,370
Come on, get down.

783
01:04:57,527 --> 01:04:59,529
You can rest in this Guest
House until the permission arrives.

784
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,069
When will we get permission?

785
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:03,034
Our visas are only for 6 days.

786
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:04,572
We must go back on the 28th.

787
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:06,807
Oh that's sadl! Back on the 28th?

788
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,508
I wish the Visa was
for two more days...

789
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:12,451
...
t would be nice to have
you at the execution on 1st.

790
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:21,458
Come on, keep moving.

791
01:05:22,552 --> 01:05:26,398
President of Pakistan, Mr. Ashraf.

792
01:05:26,623 --> 01:05:29,433
As you know...

793
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,873
Sistermthe stuffed
bread have turned stale.

794
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,638
It's hard to keep them
fresh all day in summer.

795
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:38,402
How will we keep
it fresh for two days?

796
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:40,470
We threw away the sweetmeat yesterday.

797
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,345
Just these...bitter-gourds...

798
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:43,577
Swapan, taste these please.
- Yes.

799
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,119
Are they fine?

800
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,424
So?

801
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,460
I mean...any problem?

802
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:56,926
Problem?

803
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,434
What can be worse than this...

804
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,959
that we're just
few steps away from him...

805
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:06,066
...but we still couldn't
meet him for two days

806
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:09,474
We

...not your same old sob stories.

807
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:12,545
Let us fix a time for tomorrow! Okay?

808
01:06:12,903 --> 01:06:14,075
You can meet him.

809
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,582
Happy?

810
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,116
Tomorrow!

811
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:25,058
Sukh.

812
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:28,652
The bitter gourd's are fine.
They're fine.

813
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:34,162
I still have four days.

814
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:35,665
I still have four days.

815
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,439
Yes, four days.

816
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:42,968
But your family's coming
to meet you tomorrow morning.

817
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,173
Don't you want to get ready?

818
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:47,911
Family?

819
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:51,618
My family?

820
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:55,079
Here? To see me.

821
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:01,688
Are you telling the truth?

822
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,038
Don't make me angry, Ranjit!

823
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:15,509
They're coming, aren't they?
- Yes, in a few hours.

824
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:20,036
Tea...p
ease serve them tea
when they get here. - We will.

825
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:22,982
Can...
 make it myself?

826
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,681
Get in.

827
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:10,620
Come.

828
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:12,528
Come. There..

829
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:27,242
Take that off.
What's in this?

830
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,744
Did you put something in it?

831
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:33,219
Did you?

832
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,588
Show me what's in your hair.

833
01:08:42,085 --> 01:08:42,722
Open your bag.

834
01:08:42,819 --> 01:08:45,823
Open your bag.
What's in your bag?

835
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:56,072
Lower your eyes.

836
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:16,661
What's in this? Poison?

837
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:23,737
Eat it and prove it.

838
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:26,329
Eat it.

839
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:32,644
Come on.

840
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:42,781
This will stay with me. Take it later.

841
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:03,827
Won't you talk to me?

842
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:08,275
I've been waiting to hear your voice.

843
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:11,709
Are you okay?

844
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:15,882
I am now.

845
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:23,188
Be strong.

846
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:24,885
Strong.

847
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:26,756
What for?

848
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:29,897
This cell ate up your youth.

849
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,296
Really?

850
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:35,302
It's been ages since
I last saw the mirror.

851
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:38,862
Few of your hairs turned grey.

852
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:44,734
Otherwise my brother looks the best.

853
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,210
Let it be.

854
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:52,910
Did your hair turn grey under the sun?

855
01:11:56,846 --> 01:12:02,228
Sukh...you still look the same.

856
01:12:02,252 --> 01:12:05,256
You only forgot to
wear lipstick for me.

857
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:17,772
Hello, brother Mandev

858
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:28,013
Thallu.

859
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:30,347
Poonam.

860
01:12:31,281 --> 01:12:32,351
Poonam.

861
01:12:33,316 --> 01:12:34,488
My Nikki.

862
01:12:35,285 --> 01:12:37,526
She's just like you.

863
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:40,460
Don't you feed her?

864
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:46,497
Tha

u...we still have time.

865
01:12:47,297 --> 01:12:52,474
Come here, children.
Let me take a good look.

866
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:03,289
God bless you both.

867
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:07,553
Dalbir my sister...

868
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:10,461
You saved my family.

869
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:12,389
Shut up.
- Save them.

870
01:13:12,455 --> 01:13:13,365
Shut up.

871
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,369
Don't do this.

872
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:21,931
I've made tea for all of you.

873
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:35,952
My desire's been fulfilled.

874
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:37,083
Nice.

875
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,922
I've brought these for you.

876
01:13:47,023 --> 01:13:49,128
We

...every1hing else went stale.

877
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:53,098
No containers allowed inside.

878
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:11,119
Eat.

879
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:13,052
Eat.

880
01:14:13,983 --> 01:14:17,453
You took really long
to feed me these bitter gourd.

881
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,907
I've brought Rakhi!

882
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:47,150
Satnam Waheguru
(Wonderful Lord)

883
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:50,395
‘Bow down to You!‘

884
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,032
Take this.

885
01:14:54,624 --> 01:14:56,501
I weaved this from the finest cotton.

886
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,606
It'll keep you warm during winter.

887
01:15:01,197 --> 01:15:02,471
Winter?

888
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,480
You'll come back home
way before the winters.

889
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:10,047
You learnt it.

890
01:15:10,907 --> 01:15:13,114
I had nothing else to do.

891
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:16,918
Come on, time's up.

892
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:17,980
What time up?

893
01:15:18,047 --> 01:15:18,457
The time is up.

894
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,016
We didn't even talk to him properly?

895
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:21,527
Come on...get up.
- Just two more minutes.

896
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:22,927
Get up. Time's up.

897
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:24,521
Just two more minutes.
- Get up.

898
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:26,590
Two more minutes.
- Come on. Move I say.

899
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:29,192
Come on...get up.
- I won't go. I won't go.

900
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:30,635
Please go.
- Just two more minutes.

901
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:33,173
They'll stan to misbehave,
and I can't do nothing.

902
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:35,675
At least I got to see you.
- I am there.

903
01:15:35,932 --> 01:15:38,208
I don't have any more courage.
- Time is up. Let's go.

904
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:40,508
You will come back.
Nothing will happen to you.

905
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:41,537
I won't go.

906
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:44,015
Please turn around
and look at me once.

907
01:15:44,073 --> 01:15:45,609
Please look at me once.

908
01:15:45,675 --> 01:15:47,086
Wait.

909
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:49,679
Enough...
et's go.
- Stop staring at me, and get out.

910
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,150
You'll come back home.

911
01:15:52,248 --> 01:15:54,728
Brother.
- Stop shouting now.

912
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:57,124
Sardarji,
don't just stand there. Keep moving.

913
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:59,056
Do you want to settle down here?

914
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:01,260
Let's go.
- Let's go...madam.

915
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:03,094
Come on.

916
01:16:03,493 --> 01:16:04,233
We are going.

917
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:05,465
Close the door properly.

918
01:16:05,495 --> 01:16:11,741
47 minutes,
we only spent 47 minutes with him.

919
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:16,580
We only spent 47 minutes.

920
01:16:42,999 --> 01:16:45,775
You sent a pleato the President
to pardon Sarbjit, right?

921
01:16:47,003 --> 01:16:48,243
This is their answer to that.

922
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,111
Then I want to hear their answer.

923
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:59,123
Hang Sarbjit. Hang Sarbjit.

924
01:16:59,148 --> 01:17:00,786
My brother's innocent.

925
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:04,088
You won't get an answer.
- My brother's innocent!

926
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:07,191
Madam, this isn't right.
- I want to talk to him.

927
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,633
These people don't know the truth.
- Take her away.

928
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:12,230
The people of Pakistan
don't know the truth.

929
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:13,534
He's innocent!

930
01:17:13,563 --> 01:17:15,042
Dalbir, they won't understand.
Come on.

931
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:16,610
Someone tell them the truth.

932
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:17,633
You please go.

933
01:17:18,601 --> 01:17:21,343
I lost my father in that incident.

934
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,311
I only said what the
police asked me to say.

935
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:26,347
They said he's Ranjit Singh.
He carried out all the blasts.

936
01:17:26,576 --> 01:17:29,147
Kalim Ali is the only
witness in this case.

937
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:30,555
And he has disavowed his statement.

938
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:32,591
Do you see that?

939
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,151
That this TV interview
has no imponance.

940
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:36,821
The statement can only
be changed in the court.

941
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:38,656
Then take him to coun.

942
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:39,665
Stop his death sentence.

943
01:17:39,689 --> 01:17:41,225
Today is Sunday, madam.

944
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:44,703
And this country's government
will change in three days.

945
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,603
Until then we can't file a new appeal.

946
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,369
This is a conspiracy.

947
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:51,744
You people are ignoring
evidence of his innocence.

948
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:54,782
Your anger is justified, madam...
- Let that be.

949
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,650
Let it be, Abdullah sir.

950
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,208
Here's the pardon letter.

951
01:17:58,608 --> 01:18:00,610
Ashraf sir has given
you an opportunity.

952
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:04,624
If those 27 families sign
on your brother's pardon letter...

953
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:07,158
...then Sarbjit can
be pardoned as well.

954
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,186
You're leaving in two days,
aren't you?

955
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:11,596
You can try this as well.

956
01:18:16,392 --> 01:18:18,872
The Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid Delhi,
Sayyed Ahmed Bukhari...

957
01:18:19,095 --> 01:18:20,597
...has mentioned in his appeal that...

958
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:24,806
...Sayyed Ahmed Jalal, requests the
people and the President of Pakistan...

959
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:28,774
...that they view Sarbjifs
case through humanitarian view.

960
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:39,750
Madam.

961
01:18:40,249 --> 01:18:41,387
Madam... one of them
is here to see you.

962
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,191
But he's refusing to come inside.

963
01:18:43,252 --> 01:18:44,731
He's sitting at the balcony,
and waiting for you.

964
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:09,254
His name was Bilal. My brother.

965
01:19:09,345 --> 01:19:11,655
He was only 21.

966
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:15,923
I didn't even have his
entire body for the burial.

967
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:23,199
God will decide your
brother's punishment.

968
01:19:23,392 --> 01:19:24,427
Not us.

969
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,205
But he's innocent.

970
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:28,742
My brother's innocent.

971
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:32,907
Sister, only the families are
innocent...on both the sides.

972
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:35,381
And yet they are the ones punished.

973
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:43,349
Dalbir ma'am!
Dalbir ma'am! Dalbir ma'am!

974
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:45,323
Dalbir ma'am!

975
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:48,251
Madam. The new
government of Pakistan...

976
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:49,887
...has put a stay on death penalty.

977
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:54,234
Sister...they've
put an indefinite stay.

978
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:59,296
It means Sarbjifs death
sentenced has been postponed for now.

979
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:02,702
This means...papa's coming home?

980
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:06,911
Not yet...but he definitely will.
- Mother.

981
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:15,545
India's largest city Mumbai
was taken at the seize last night.

982
01:20:15,745 --> 01:20:17,554
..by suspected Pakistani terrorists.

983
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:19,521
Crores of innocent
citizens were ruthlessly.

984
01:20:19,749 --> 01:20:21,524
..murdered and several are suspected.

985
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:22,995
..to be still held hostage.

986
01:20:23,219 --> 01:20:25,495
Whole world is left in shock.

987
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:27,363
..as Indian democracy is under attack.

988
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:28,730
No one will.

989
01:20:28,891 --> 01:20:29,995
You listen to me.

990
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:33,531
You won't board this
stupid bus and go there.

991
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:37,409
This stupid bus will
depan today, mother.

992
01:20:37,767 --> 01:20:39,747
And anyway...today is Bakar-Eid.

993
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:40,769
This day calls for sacrifices...

994
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,281
Go Backl! Go Backl!

995
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:43,372
Go Backl! Go Backl!

996
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:45,316
I'm sure you're filled with anger too.

997
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:47,383
Don't you want to express your anger?

998
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:51,781
Anger is what I've been
expressing all these years.

999
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,793
Go Backl! Go Backl!

1000
01:20:53,816 --> 01:20:55,352
Go Backl! Go Backl!

1001
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,760
Go Backl! Go Backl!

1002
01:20:56,819 --> 01:20:58,298
Go Backl! Go Backl!

1003
01:20:58,387 --> 01:20:59,957
Go back!

1004
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:01,968
ls this a joke?
Only one man.

1005
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:04,868
We tolerated so much
and gathered here for peace.

1006
01:21:04,894 --> 01:21:07,033
And this is their answer.
Only one man.

1007
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:10,970
Go back! Go back!

1008
01:21:13,803 --> 01:21:17,410
Go back!

1009
01:21:17,506 --> 01:21:19,349
Go back!

1010
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:21,046
Go back!

1011
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:23,290
Go back!

1012
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:26,053
Whether it's one torch
or one hundred thousand

1013
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:31,056
All you need is one
spark to ignite it.

1014
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,992
Whether it's love or hatred...

1015
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,993
...one hean is enough
for it to thrive in .

1016
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:37,901
Let it be...

1017
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,803
Hands which hold guns in them...

1018
01:21:39,829 --> 01:21:41,604
...their hearts only desire hatred.

1019
01:21:44,433 --> 01:21:46,071
Greetings, India.

1020
01:21:46,969 --> 01:21:49,347
My name's Awais Sheikh.

1021
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:52,444
I am a small lawyer from Lahore.

1022
01:21:52,475 --> 01:21:57,083
Thanks to Allah I've never been
associated with guns or bullets yet.

1023
01:21:57,346 --> 01:22:01,852
I knew no one's coming
alongmyet I came here all alone.

1024
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:04,091
Because I am sure...

1025
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:09,366
...a single voice raised for peace speaks
louder then a thousand voices raised for enmity.

1026
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:21,911
I've heard a lot of Sarbjifs case.

1027
01:22:22,905 --> 01:22:25,943
Don't worry. I'll meet his lawyer.

1028
01:22:26,876 --> 01:22:28,514
And I promise you...

1029
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:30,852
...he'

 now have a kin in Pakistan.

1030
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:38,421
Amidst the sound of bullets and firing,
with a message of peace.

1031
01:22:43,893 --> 01:22:46,635
Ranjifs lawyer, Abdullah Hasan...

1032
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:49,040
...didn't appear for the
last three hearings, and...

1033
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:50,133
...he won't this time either.

1034
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:51,911
But sir, this is absolutely wrong.

1035
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:54,114
This way the appeal will
get annulled automatically.

1036
01:22:54,503 --> 01:22:57,143
And anyway, this is Sarbjifs
last chance to freedom.

1037
01:22:57,406 --> 01:22:58,146
Ranjit!

1038
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:00,687
All I am asking for is another date.

1039
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:03,383
It's just a date for you,
but for him...

1040
01:23:03,512 --> 01:23:05,651
...it means some more time to live.

1041
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:10,153
Mr. Sheikh,
you're not his appointed lawyer...

1042
01:23:10,386 --> 01:23:12,992
...nor are you his relative...
- Call it a human bond.

1043
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:17,398
Unfortunately, these things
don't exist in our country anymore.

1044
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:20,168
I am rejecting this appeal.

1045
01:23:20,396 --> 01:23:23,639
But his lawyer has only 48 hours...

1046
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:26,043
...to file one last petition.

1047
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:28,103
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

1048
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:31,474
If you like to play messiah,
then take up some other issue.

1049
01:23:31,941 --> 01:23:33,614
You can't save this Indian.

1050
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,011
We tried our best...
- The problem is...

1051
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:39,115
...you tried him as an Indian,
and not your client.

1052
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:42,924
You cou
d've at least
been honest to your profession.

1053
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:44,931
Then you show your
humanity and honesty.

1054
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:45,988
Why lust him?

1055
01:23:46,055 --> 01:23:48,001
There are many other Indian
infidels rotting in our jail.

1056
01:23:48,457 --> 01:23:49,936
Be their messiah.

1057
01:23:49,959 --> 01:23:50,994
Here you go.

1058
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:53,005
Here's some more.

1059
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:54,132
And this too.

1060
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:55,607
I have some more files.

1061
01:23:56,432 --> 01:23:58,070
Take them and go.

1062
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:04,983
It's from Pakistan.
- Pakistan?

1063
01:24:05,174 --> 01:24:07,552
Hello.
- Hello, sister.

1064
01:24:07,643 --> 01:24:08,951
Awais Sheikh speaking.

1065
01:24:08,978 --> 01:24:09,979
Remember me.

1066
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:13,026
We need to file a
new appeal for Sarbjit.

1067
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:15,058
We have only 24 hours.

1068
01:24:15,084 --> 01:24:18,031
So email me the power of
attorney as soon as possible.

1069
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,191
0K8‘!-

1070
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:23,570
ls every1hing okay, aunt?

1071
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:24,970
Let's go.

1072
01:24:25,027 --> 01:24:26,199
I'm saying it again...

1073
01:24:26,495 --> 01:24:29,032
I cannot allow you to meet that man.

1074
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,066
We've not received any
application from his lawyer.

1075
01:24:31,133 --> 01:24:32,703
Sir, that lawyer's been terminated.

1076
01:24:32,768 --> 01:24:33,712
I am his new lawyer.

1077
01:24:33,769 --> 01:24:37,148
You have papers.
- that's what I have come to get signed.

1078
01:24:37,673 --> 01:24:40,745
We cannot allow you to take any
papers inside without coun orders.

1079
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:41,784
Get that?

1080
01:24:42,011 --> 01:24:43,081
Agreed.

1081
01:24:43,479 --> 01:24:48,485
That means...
 can go inside
without any papers. Right?

1082
01:24:50,486 --> 01:24:51,590
This is the death sentence barrack.

1083
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:55,695
And this stench is of fear.

1084
01:24:55,991 --> 01:24:57,868
Come on, walk fast.

1085
01:24:57,893 --> 01:25:00,772
Half of them have
already lost their mind.

1086
01:25:01,864 --> 01:25:03,810
And the rest live in solitude.

1087
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,875
Meaning in solitary.

1088
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,582
Great.

1089
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:13,511
You don't give them death...
but instead take their life away.

1090
01:25:21,717 --> 01:25:22,661
Sarbjit.

1091
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:31,698
Last time only my family
addressed me with this name in here.

1092
01:25:33,095 --> 01:25:34,836
I am no stranger, brother.

1093
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:36,668
My name's Awais Sheikh.

1094
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:38,572
And I am your new lawyer.

1095
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:42,578
We've very less time.
So just trust me.

1096
01:25:42,771 --> 01:25:43,715
Lawyer?

1097
01:25:43,772 --> 01:25:45,718
I need your signatures on these.

1098
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:04,103
Sit down for a minute.

1099
01:26:05,561 --> 01:26:07,302
I don't get visitors too often.

1100
01:26:09,565 --> 01:26:12,011
I promise you,
brother...
'

 return soon.

1101
01:26:12,635 --> 01:26:15,639
And when I do...
'

 bring good news.

1102
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:20,714
Take care.

1103
01:26:22,711 --> 01:26:23,689
Let's come to the point.

1104
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:25,956
I heard something about you, sister.

1105
01:26:26,148 --> 01:26:28,150
If you decide to do something...

1106
01:26:28,584 --> 01:26:30,586
...you don't let
go until doomsday. Huh?

1107
01:26:31,587 --> 01:26:32,930
Who?

1108
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:36,360
Ranjit Singh..

1109
01:26:36,592 --> 01:26:38,128
If Ranjit Singh...
committed the crime...

1110
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:40,639
...then he's the one
who should be punished.

1111
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:44,667
You have all the evidence to prove that
he's Sarbjit, but no one believes it.

1112
01:26:44,967 --> 01:26:48,039
It's clear that no one wants
to admit their mistake.

1113
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:50,844
No one's trying to
find the real Ranjit Singh

1114
01:26:53,642 --> 01:26:54,882
It belongs to my son.

1115
01:26:54,977 --> 01:26:55,978
But it'll come in handy to you.

1116
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:56,852
Thanks.

1117
01:26:56,912 --> 01:26:59,654
Introduce your aunt to Mr. Google.

1118
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:00,951
Google?

1119
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:03,823
I've heard that Google can
find anything except for God.

1120
01:27:07,089 --> 01:27:07,794
Brother.
- Yes.

1121
01:27:07,856 --> 01:27:11,633
Brother, this rogue is hiding right here.

1122
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:16,164
Dalbir, I have information about
the real culprit, and I can send it to you.

1123
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:19,405
He has also been accused of the
1990 bomb blast in Lahore, Pakistan.

1124
01:27:19,635 --> 01:27:20,909
But Sarbjit Singh is serving sentence.

1125
01:27:21,003 --> 01:27:25,782
Who is this man posing as Ranjit Singh
aka Mumtaj Sarik aka Anmol Singh.

1126
01:27:25,841 --> 01:27:27,946
A reponerma terrorist
or a businessman?

1127
01:27:28,043 --> 01:27:28,817
He is a double agent.

1128
01:27:28,877 --> 01:27:30,220
Pakistani Sakil Asad
Sheikh has said...

1129
01:27:30,646 --> 01:27:32,216
...that he will soon
conjure some evidence...

1130
01:27:32,648 --> 01:27:35,652
...and on the basis of those evidence,
he'll appeal to reopen the case.

1131
01:27:36,652 --> 01:27:39,656
Please don't... Please stop

1132
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,860
Awais Sheikh, you must die...

1133
01:27:41,957 --> 01:27:43,937
Bloody Traitor...

1134
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:46,834
He's fighting for an Indian

1135
01:27:46,962 --> 01:27:48,805
Bloody Traitor...!

1136
01:27:48,864 --> 01:27:53,040
Awais Sheikh, you must die...

1137
01:27:53,135 --> 01:27:58,141
Oh this is crazy... how funny to see
a lawyer practicing judicial duties...

1138
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:01,915
what difference does it make
if your client is Guilty or Innocent

1139
01:28:01,977 --> 01:28:07,893
we should only look at him as an Indian,
and he should be punished for that

1140
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:11,125
burn this traitor down...

1141
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:15,690
How can he forget our 62
year old hatred towards India

1142
01:28:15,724 --> 01:28:16,930
Burn this traitor down

1143
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:18,095
Lets set an example...

1144
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:22,732
So that no one ever
dares to fight for humanity

1145
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:26,077
Awais Sheikh, you must die

1146
01:28:26,101 --> 01:28:28,240
Humanity, you must die

1147
01:28:28,704 --> 01:28:32,311
Sir please come with me
Sir please let leave

1148
01:28:44,887 --> 01:28:48,027
You're back.

1149
01:28:52,861 --> 01:28:55,933
How did you bring it?

1150
01:28:58,066 --> 01:29:00,205
You've grown up.

1151
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:28,138
"
 sleep with pains."

1152
01:29:28,897 --> 01:29:32,845
"For you, they are raindrops."

1153
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:37,078
"They are actually my tears."

1154
01:29:37,172 --> 01:29:41,086
"For you, they are raindrops."

1155
01:29:41,143 --> 01:29:45,091
"They are actually my tears."

1156
01:29:45,147 --> 01:29:53,089
"
'm waiting on the path."

1157
01:29:53,955 --> 01:29:58,233
"
f I had wings,
I'd have flown to you."

1158
01:29:58,327 --> 01:30:02,139
"
 wouldn't even take a halt."

1159
01:30:02,197 --> 01:30:06,202
"What kind of punishment is this?"

1160
01:30:06,268 --> 01:30:09,875
"
 feel checked..."

1161
01:30:09,938 --> 01:30:13,977
"..these days."

1162
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:18,184
"..these days."

1163
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:23,593
"..these days."

1164
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:32,898
"
 sleep with pains."

1165
01:30:34,997 --> 01:30:44,008
"
 sleep with pains."

1166
01:31:02,224 --> 01:31:04,204
Madam, Ranjit Singh

1167
01:31:04,259 --> 01:31:06,136
...has been arrested
on charges of fraudulent in Chandigarh.

1168
01:31:06,194 --> 01:31:07,969
He'll be presented in coun tomorrow.

1169
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:14,914
Go straight from there.

1170
01:31:19,274 --> 01:31:21,413
Ranjit Singh Mattu

1171
01:31:21,877 --> 01:31:22,878
Take this... leave me.

1172
01:31:22,911 --> 01:31:24,413
Hey!! Who are these two...

1173
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,925
I will not spare you.

1174
01:31:26,949 --> 01:31:28,451
What are you doing?
- Leave me.

1175
01:31:28,884 --> 01:31:29,362
You Rascal...

1176
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:30,395
Are you mad?

1177
01:31:30,452 --> 01:31:31,954
Stop them...

1178
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:34,024
Can you Sleep peacefully at night

1179
01:31:34,389 --> 01:31:36,300
Can you eat peacefully

1180
01:31:36,892 --> 01:31:41,272
One innocent man... is paying for
your evil deeds since past 20 years...

1181
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:43,434
Don't you fear Almighty...

1182
01:31:44,132 --> 01:31:46,373
You shameless Rascal...

1183
01:31:46,468 --> 01:31:48,209
Now you won't be spared...

1184
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:51,211
I've have all evidences in place...

1185
01:31:51,473 --> 01:31:54,147
I'll make sure you
are hanged for your deeds...

1186
01:31:55,176 --> 01:32:00,148
Oh Sisterl! me and the evidences against
me have been roaming free for a long time...

1187
01:32:00,182 --> 01:32:01,923
But did anything ever happen!!!

1188
01:32:02,918 --> 01:32:04,397
Nothing will happen! !

1189
01:32:04,453 --> 01:32:08,924
They didn't arrest
me... I got myself arrested...

1190
01:32:09,124 --> 01:32:13,971
My well wishers are immune
from your curses and proofs...

1191
01:32:13,995 --> 01:32:15,201
Come, let's go...

1192
01:32:27,943 --> 01:32:31,152
They gave me back my identity,
but not my freedom.

1193
01:32:32,347 --> 01:32:35,191
They caught him,
Ranjit Singhl!

1194
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:38,026
What more evidence
does your government need...

1195
01:32:38,086 --> 01:32:39,190
...for my innocence.

1196
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:41,028
Brother, have politicians and government
ever admitted to their mistakes...

1197
01:32:41,089 --> 01:32:43,035
...that they'll admit now

1198
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:45,334
The Indians let him
free in just four days.

1199
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:47,066
If they had arrested him here,
I would've...

1200
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:49,233
Anyway...we won't give up.

1201
01:32:49,431 --> 01:32:51,206
The Courage's left me instead.

1202
01:32:51,266 --> 01:32:54,076
All I have now is my stubbornness.

1203
01:32:54,202 --> 01:32:56,011
I am stubborn too.

1204
01:32:57,172 --> 01:32:59,174
No matter how high
the destination is...

1205
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:02,178
...the path's always
under our feet only.

1206
01:33:04,279 --> 01:33:09,456
Mr. Sheikh...do you believe in fate?

1207
01:33:10,151 --> 01:33:14,190
These fate lines are very stubborn.

1208
01:33:16,558 --> 01:33:22,304
You can clench them...
but never control them.

1209
01:33:22,364 --> 01:33:28,178
Fate is for everyone
Even for those who don't have arms.

1210
01:33:30,005 --> 01:33:32,485
Listen, remember Sukhbir.

1211
01:33:33,241 --> 01:33:35,243
From barrack no.11.

1212
01:33:35,277 --> 01:33:37,018
He's become Salman now.

1213
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:40,386
He comes out in open
air five times a day.

1214
01:33:40,482 --> 01:33:41,790
To pray-

1215
01:33:42,183 --> 01:33:45,096
And I've heard that he'll
be set free on next Eid.

1216
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,027
If you want, I can...

1217
01:33:47,055 --> 01:33:49,467
May my God also bless him too.

1218
01:33:51,493 --> 01:33:54,372
I just got my identity back.

1219
01:33:54,596 --> 01:33:56,803
Now I won't give it back.

1220
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:10,085
Myself...

1221
01:34:13,515 --> 01:34:16,257
Sarbjit Singh Atwal.

1222
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:18,557
Son of...

1223
01:34:22,557 --> 01:34:25,128
Sulakkhan Singh Atwal.

1224
01:34:25,627 --> 01:34:30,235
Vi

age...Bhikhiwind. India.

1225
01:34:32,467 --> 01:34:34,447
India's supreme coun has annulled
the mercy petition.

1226
01:34:34,469 --> 01:34:37,609
..of Ajmal Kasab, the main accused
of 26/11 Mumbai attack.

1227
01:34:38,073 --> 01:34:40,314
Now the date of Ajmal Kasab's
death penalty is final.

1228
01:34:40,342 --> 01:34:42,151
I've been coming here for six months.

1229
01:34:42,177 --> 01:34:43,178
Will I ever get to see him?

1230
01:34:43,278 --> 01:34:44,586
You don't get it, Mr. Sheikh.

1231
01:34:45,147 --> 01:34:47,127
We can't let you in
Without the court's order.

1232
01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:48,593
Come with me.
- ljust want to give him his medicines...

1233
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:50,288
Come with me.
- Sir...

1234
01:34:51,086 --> 01:34:54,499
I'll show Father all
my wedding pictures. - Yes.

1235
01:34:55,123 --> 01:34:56,295
Come.

1236
01:34:56,658 --> 01:34:59,104
Brother, did you get the job done?

1237
01:34:59,127 --> 01:35:02,336
I could get only one visa.
- One?

1238
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:07,476
God knows what I had to
go through for your visa alone.

1239
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:11,116
I tried my best for the rest,
but unfonunately.

1240
01:35:13,575 --> 01:35:15,316
They are joking with us.

1241
01:35:15,343 --> 01:35:16,287
Unbelievable.

1242
01:35:17,112 --> 01:35:18,682
Just because India passed
the verdict on Ajmal Kasab...

1243
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:20,420
...we've to face the consequences.

1244
01:35:22,183 --> 01:35:23,890
But how can I go alone?

1245
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,721
What Will I tell Sarbjit?

1246
01:35:28,323 --> 01:35:31,133
They are his wife and children?

1247
01:35:31,159 --> 01:35:33,662
They have a right to meet him.
- Let it be, sister.

1248
01:35:34,696 --> 01:35:38,701
Please sister, his wife and kids
have only lived off hope till now.

1249
01:35:39,634 --> 01:35:41,671
When have they got the chance
practice their rights. - No, no.

1250
01:35:42,137 --> 01:35:43,480
You'll get your rights soon.

1251
01:35:43,538 --> 01:35:47,281
And I promise...
I'll bring Sarbjit here soon.

1252
01:35:47,342 --> 01:35:49,379
You just see.
- See what?

1253
01:35:50,311 --> 01:35:52,313
Eyes have no life left,
they've become rocks.

1254
01:35:53,548 --> 01:35:55,186
Now its only both of you.

1255
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:57,220
Who have to fight this battle

1256
01:35:58,386 --> 01:36:00,491
For us it?s again a long wait.

1257
01:36:05,293 --> 01:36:07,204
‘I am here for a month.‘

1258
01:36:07,395 --> 01:36:09,534
‘I'll come see you at any cost.‘

1259
01:36:10,565 --> 01:36:11,703
Brother...‘

1260
01:36:13,401 --> 01:36:18,612
'Look...Swapan's looking
so cute in her wedding dress.‘

1261
01:36:19,574 --> 01:36:21,952
‘She sent all her wedding photos too.‘

1262
01:36:23,578 --> 01:36:25,717
I don't get anything here anymore.

1263
01:36:28,183 --> 01:36:30,220
Just paying for my deeds.

1264
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:38,236
What crime did I commit so grave...
that I've been cursed like this.

1265
01:36:38,259 --> 01:36:41,240
What are you saying?

1266
01:36:42,497 --> 01:36:48,504
Your fami
y...the entire
Country is praying for you.

1267
01:36:49,604 --> 01:36:52,448
That's why you're
still safe and sound.

1268
01:36:57,545 --> 01:36:58,751
I am safe and sound.

1269
01:37:02,617 --> 01:37:04,756
I am safe and sound.

1270
01:37:06,788 --> 01:37:08,426
I am safe and sound!

1271
01:37:09,257 --> 01:37:11,294
You call this safe and sound.

1272
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:16,468
It's been 21 years since
I last hugged someone.

1273
01:37:17,399 --> 01:37:20,471
In 21 years I've bathed only 11 times.

1274
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:24,806
I am caged like a animal...
my life has no meaning...

1275
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:26,580
And You call that safe and sound!

1276
01:37:28,243 --> 01:37:30,280
I couldn't sleep for days.

1277
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:33,690
My entire life revolves
in front of my eyes.

1278
01:37:35,383 --> 01:37:38,023
What was my mistake, sister?
- No, no...

1279
01:37:38,253 --> 01:37:39,823
What was my mistake, sister?

1280
01:37:40,255 --> 01:37:43,634
I live that moment over
and over again for years...

1281
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,398
I will go crazy.
- No, no...

1282
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:48,669
I don't want to go crazy.
- For God sake, No.

1283
01:37:48,763 --> 01:37:50,367
Don't do it.
- Save me.

1284
01:37:50,432 --> 01:37:51,638
I won't let anything happen to you.

1285
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:55,579
Save me. Save me.
- No, brother.

1286
01:37:56,504 --> 01:37:59,417
I will go crazy.
- No, brother.

1287
01:37:59,474 --> 01:38:01,715
Save me. Save me.

1288
01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:03,847
Be strong.
I won't let anything happen to you.

1289
01:38:04,279 --> 01:38:06,350
Save me.

1290
01:38:23,698 --> 01:38:25,405
Sheikh sir.

1291
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:27,805
Sheikh sir, stay back.

1292
01:38:27,869 --> 01:38:31,442
Stay back Sheikh sir.

1293
01:38:43,718 --> 01:38:46,528
Forgive me, but you'll have to walk.

1294
01:38:47,388 --> 01:38:48,696
You can catch a bus up ahead.

1295
01:38:49,724 --> 01:38:54,332
You can step down if you want.
I won't have any regrets.

1296
01:38:55,397 --> 01:38:56,637
Will you?

1297
01:38:57,766 --> 01:38:58,836
No!

1298
01:38:59,567 --> 01:39:03,674
But I'm fighting for my brother.

1299
01:39:04,706 --> 01:39:05,707
Me too.

1300
01:39:06,908 --> 01:39:08,114
Come.

1301
01:39:08,743 --> 01:39:11,724
Do you think Mr. Ansari will
be the messiah...you're waiting for?

1302
01:39:11,746 --> 01:39:14,750
Your country is giving
death sentence to our people...

1303
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:16,921
...and you've come here
to get Sarbjit acquitted.

1304
01:39:17,752 --> 01:39:18,662
No...

1305
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:21,491
Please lets all stop
pointing fingers...

1306
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:23,936
Life is too shon to waste.

1307
01:39:24,459 --> 01:39:26,905
After that...
we'll all be reduced to dust.

1308
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:28,736
Wow, Dalbir.

1309
01:39:28,763 --> 01:39:31,539
Does RAW train their
agents in poetry as well?

1310
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:35,945
Common people like us cou
d've
never said something like this.

1311
01:39:36,604 --> 01:39:40,142
Why do both our countries only
share a relation of doubt?

1312
01:39:41,442 --> 01:39:43,444
We're connected by land.

1313
01:39:43,878 --> 01:39:47,155
We're connected by
the lush corn fields.

1314
01:39:47,616 --> 01:39:50,392
When did these rifts
crop up in our relations?

1315
01:39:50,418 --> 01:39:52,159
Why is every Indian an enemy...

1316
01:39:52,553 --> 01:39:54,931
...and every Pakistani a terrorist?

1317
01:39:56,958 --> 01:40:01,805
Be it in anger,
but try to embrace us once at least.

1318
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:04,803
You'll find a brother,
and not a enemy.

1319
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,705
Sarbjifs your brother.

1320
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:11,479
What's this hatred
towards your brother?

1321
01:40:12,607 --> 01:40:18,614
Mr. Ansari...he's just not
mine but he's your brother too.

1322
01:40:19,414 --> 01:40:22,725
Blood is neither Umber, nor Green

1323
01:40:23,418 --> 01:40:26,422
We share the common
red in our blood...

1324
01:40:28,623 --> 01:40:30,432
Will The people of Pakistan hear

1325
01:40:30,491 --> 01:40:31,970
...This sisters Plea

1326
01:40:36,831 --> 01:40:38,435
Brother.

1327
01:40:40,568 --> 01:40:41,706
Brother.

1328
01:40:42,737 --> 01:40:44,444
Sit down. Sit down.

1329
01:40:44,472 --> 01:40:46,952
Let's eat together...
I cooked.

1330
01:40:47,008 --> 01:40:48,510
Sit down. Sit down.

1331
01:40:53,447 --> 01:40:54,585
Here.

1332
01:41:03,558 --> 01:41:06,539
You've become quite
famous around here.

1333
01:41:07,462 --> 01:41:12,468
Everyone talks quite
respectfully about you in jail.

1334
01:41:14,802 --> 01:41:15,974
Look.

1335
01:41:18,806 --> 01:41:19,910
Look.

1336
01:41:21,476 --> 01:41:27,552
They gather newspapers for me.
- They are great.

1337
01:41:28,883 --> 01:41:29,987
Look.

1338
01:41:37,692 --> 01:41:41,868
Anyway...my destiny can't be changed.

1339
01:41:42,764 --> 01:41:47,736
But you have power now.
You've the stature.

1340
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:50,578
You can help someone else...
- Power?

1341
01:41:51,105 --> 01:41:52,709
Stature?

1342
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:55,885
If I could do something...

1343
01:41:56,644 --> 01:41:59,284
...we would be sitting
in our home instead.

1344
01:41:59,981 --> 01:42:05,021
I've grown old banging one door after
another. Answering to everyone's questions.

1345
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,898
I give a speech...and
listen to their claps.

1346
01:42:09,757 --> 01:42:12,101
I give another speech and people applaud...
I give more speeches and people applaud more.

1347
01:42:14,529 --> 01:42:15,064
This...

1348
01:42:15,096 --> 01:42:19,101
These newspapers...
this news, they're useless.

1349
01:42:19,534 --> 01:42:20,604
Bunch of joke.

1350
01:42:22,003 --> 01:42:23,573
I am a joke too.

1351
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:29,614
I couldn't do any1hing, brother.

1352
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:33,982
I couldn't do anything
in all these years.

1353
01:42:35,916 --> 01:42:36,826
Hey...

1354
01:42:38,119 --> 01:42:42,625
You Crazy!!!
You made me Sarbjit again.

1355
01:42:43,758 --> 01:42:44,828
My name.

1356
01:42:46,027 --> 01:42:51,602
Sarbjit.
It's soaring all around the world.

1357
01:42:51,933 --> 01:42:53,344
Free.

1358
01:42:57,972 --> 01:43:03,081
Sarbjifs sister...wow!

1359
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:13,121
Look here.

1360
01:43:14,922 --> 01:43:18,665
This Pakistani was 11 years old...

1361
01:43:18,726 --> 01:43:21,798
...when he separated from his
family at Delhi Railway station.

1362
01:43:23,998 --> 01:43:25,375
He's got paralyses.

1363
01:43:26,134 --> 01:43:30,879
Yet he's been locked up
all these years in Tihar jail.

1364
01:43:35,176 --> 01:43:38,020
Return him to his mother.

1365
01:43:44,886 --> 01:43:46,695
Promise me.

1366
01:43:48,056 --> 01:43:49,899
You tell everyone...

1367
01:43:50,191 --> 01:43:53,798
...that they should look
at me as their brother.

1368
01:43:55,196 --> 01:43:57,938
Then you look at him as your Sarbjit.

1369
01:44:02,670 --> 01:44:05,742
No...
et's eat.

1370
01:44:06,808 --> 01:44:09,015
I made it with such love, eat it.

1371
01:44:19,987 --> 01:44:21,989
Here. You eat too.

1372
01:44:26,193 --> 01:44:27,831
Give me.

1373
01:44:30,198 --> 01:44:33,077
You'll be going back
through the border.

1374
01:44:33,868 --> 01:44:36,144
But before you go,
I thought I should show you a place...

1375
01:44:36,204 --> 01:44:37,774
...where there are no borders yet.

1376
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:45,921
"Everyone prostrates in faith."

1377
01:44:47,148 --> 01:44:53,895
"But I'm going to bow from my heart."

1378
01:44:54,355 --> 01:45:00,328
"
'm going to mend my broken fate..."

1379
01:45:01,395 --> 01:45:09,906
"...at Your threshold before I 
eave."

1380
01:45:28,088 --> 01:45:31,262
"l came here because You called.

1381
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:33,361
"
 am grateful."

1382
01:45:33,427 --> 01:45:36,840
"Then eradicate these borders..."

1383
01:45:36,864 --> 01:45:39,037
"...that exist between us."

1384
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:42,013
"O benevolent One."

1385
01:45:42,070 --> 01:45:44,414
"O benevolent One."

1386
01:45:44,472 --> 01:45:49,444
Pakistani President Mr. Ansari arrived
at Ajmer Sharif Along with his son Hilal.

1387
01:45:49,477 --> 01:45:52,458
In their efforts to better
their relations with Pakistan...

1388
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,484
...
ndia has decided
to release Khalil Chisti.

1389
01:45:54,882 --> 01:45:56,884
Hopes are not high
for Sarbjifs release as well.

1390
01:45:56,951 --> 01:45:59,864
"O benevolent One."

1391
01:45:59,921 --> 01:46:02,868
"O benevolent One."

1392
01:46:02,924 --> 01:46:06,371
"O benevolent One."

1393
01:46:06,461 --> 01:46:08,463
"
've decided this today."

1394
01:46:08,896 --> 01:46:12,309
Father's being released tomorrow!
? "At your doorsteps.."

1395
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:17,975
Father's being released tomorrow!
? "..
've shed tears."

1396
01:46:18,105 --> 01:46:24,215
Father's being released tomorrow!
? "
've no complains. Have tried all the tricks."

1397
01:46:27,014 --> 01:46:29,927
"You can turn years
of imprisonment..."

1398
01:46:29,984 --> 01:46:32,965
"...into freedom in a moment."

1399
01:46:32,987 --> 01:46:35,991
"My nature's to commit crimes..."

1400
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:38,366
"...and it's Your habit
to forgive them."

1401
01:46:38,459 --> 01:46:41,235
"O benevolent One."

1402
01:46:41,295 --> 01:46:44,174
"O benevolent One."

1403
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:59,491
"There's a incense
burning inside me..."

1404
01:46:59,513 --> 01:47:03,120
"...
'm lost in your fragrance."

1405
01:47:05,386 --> 01:47:08,333
"
 feel fresh like the spring..."

1406
01:47:08,356 --> 01:47:11,929
"...and chirpy like the birds."

1407
01:47:14,362 --> 01:47:17,343
"
 can see through and through."

1408
01:47:17,365 --> 01:47:20,312
"
've become Your mirror."

1409
01:47:20,367 --> 01:47:25,510
"
've met myself at
every nook and corner."

1410
01:47:26,207 --> 01:47:29,051
"With Your grace
I'll meet my beloved."

1411
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:32,353
"Feels like heaven's
been laid under my feet."

1412
01:47:32,446 --> 01:47:34,517
"O benevolent One."

1413
01:47:34,982 --> 01:47:37,519
"O benevolent One."

1414
01:47:37,551 --> 01:47:40,430
"O benevolent One."

1415
01:47:40,487 --> 01:47:43,400
"O benevolent One."

1416
01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:46,300
"O benevolent One."

1417
01:47:46,427 --> 01:47:50,068
"O benevolent One."

1418
01:47:50,097 --> 01:47:52,338
"O benevolent One."

1419
01:47:52,399 --> 01:47:55,403
"O benevolent One."

1420
01:47:56,003 --> 01:48:01,282
"O benevolent One."

1421
01:48:01,342 --> 01:48:04,255
"O benevolent One."

1422
01:48:04,312 --> 01:48:07,316
"O benevolent One."

1423
01:48:07,381 --> 01:48:10,225
"O benevolent One."

1424
01:48:10,251 --> 01:48:13,255
"O benevolent One."

1425
01:48:13,287 --> 01:48:16,097
"O benevolent One."

1426
01:48:16,123 --> 01:48:19,127
"O benevolent One."

1427
01:48:19,227 --> 01:48:22,140
"O benevolent One."

1428
01:48:22,196 --> 01:48:26,076
"O benevolent One."

1429
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:29,411
"O benevolent One."

1430
01:48:29,470 --> 01:48:32,451
"O benevolent One."

1431
01:48:33,307 --> 01:48:34,377
Hello.

1432
01:48:35,443 --> 01:48:37,116
Hello?

1433
01:48:37,277 --> 01:48:38,312
What are you saying?

1434
01:48:38,579 --> 01:48:40,354
Such a bad joke?

1435
01:48:40,414 --> 01:48:42,519
Not Sarbjit, its Surjit.

1436
01:48:42,650 --> 01:48:45,392
Serving sentence in
Lakhpath jail for bomb blasts...

1437
01:48:45,452 --> 01:48:48,296
...
ndian citizen
Sarbjifs release story...

1438
01:48:48,322 --> 01:48:52,134
...turned upside down due to sensitive conditions
on Babur Abdullans decision.

1439
01:48:54,562 --> 01:48:58,135
Late night, president Asif
Ali Zardari's spokesperson...

1440
01:48:58,165 --> 01:49:00,202
...Farat Ullah Babur informed us

1441
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:04,612
That Pakishtan will be releasing
Surjit Singh and not Sarbjit.

1442
01:49:04,672 --> 01:49:08,085
Even Surjit Singh was locked
up in Pakistan's Lakhpat jail.

1443
01:49:08,142 --> 01:49:13,114
While clearing the misconceptions
on Sarbjifs release, President Zardari said...

1444
01:49:13,147 --> 01:49:15,286
I think there has been
some miscommunication.

1445
01:49:15,349 --> 01:49:17,625
First of all, this is not about
asking for forgiveness.

1446
01:49:18,085 --> 01:49:21,498
Secondly, Surjit is being released,
and not Sarbjit.

1447
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:55,464
Aunty. Aunt‘!-

1448
01:49:55,522 --> 01:49:56,694
Aunty isn't opening the door.

1449
01:49:57,124 --> 01:49:58,228
Aunty. Aunt‘!-

1450
01:49:58,326 --> 01:50:00,203
Aunty isn't opening the door.

1451
01:50:00,227 --> 01:50:01,501
Aunt‘!-

1452
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:03,597
Open the door.

1453
01:50:03,664 --> 01:50:05,575
Aunty!

1454
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,572
Aunty!

1455
01:50:08,369 --> 01:50:11,179
Sister...
- Aunty.

1456
01:50:18,512 --> 01:50:20,514
You've become more
imponant than us, right?

1457
01:50:24,184 --> 01:50:29,395
Your battle, your sorrows...
they're bigger than us.

1458
01:50:31,158 --> 01:50:33,604
You even tried to
make a sacrifice today.

1459
01:50:35,529 --> 01:50:37,509
Da
bir's so great.

1460
01:50:37,731 --> 01:50:40,678
She gave up her life for her brother.

1461
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:45,442
Applauds...praises.

1462
01:50:46,373 --> 01:50:48,649
This sister is a fine
example for this world.

1463
01:50:51,445 --> 01:50:53,721
I am his wife.

1464
01:50:55,682 --> 01:50:59,425
Even I thought of ending every1hing.

1465
01:51:00,421 --> 01:51:04,233
Liberate myself from
these responsibilities.

1466
01:51:04,425 --> 01:51:10,171
But...you kept saying,
that you'll bring him back home.

1467
01:51:11,332 --> 01:51:13,278
And I kept listening.

1468
01:51:16,437 --> 01:51:21,352
But my husband didn't come home.
- Sukh.

1469
01:51:21,609 --> 01:51:27,321
That man who was released
todaymwas locked up for 32 years.

1470
01:51:28,282 --> 01:51:31,559
He was released 21 years
after he had served his sentence.

1471
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:35,726
Even his family had
forgotten all about him.

1472
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:38,792
But he's back home now...

1473
01:51:40,795 --> 01:51:42,502
...not my husband.

1474
01:51:43,764 --> 01:51:46,472
I know I made a mistake.

1475
01:51:50,471 --> 01:51:53,543
But...Sarbjit's issue isn't so big.

1476
01:51:53,641 --> 01:51:55,484
Why don't you understand?

1477
01:51:55,776 --> 01:52:00,782
Sarbjifs alive today
because it's such a big issue.

1478
01:52:01,649 --> 01:52:05,722
Today One man was released because of
him...tomorrow they'll release more.

1479
01:52:06,286 --> 01:52:11,258
Only because you didn't
make the mistake of keeping quiet.

1480
01:52:13,728 --> 01:52:19,269
You kept this battle alive.
You kept me alive.

1481
01:52:20,568 --> 01:52:24,744
But remember...
 am only breathing.

1482
01:52:25,439 --> 01:52:28,579
My life comes back with Sarbjit.

1483
01:52:29,877 --> 01:52:31,788
So don't you dare...

1484
01:52:32,413 --> 01:52:35,826
Don't you dare step back now.

1485
01:52:36,583 --> 01:52:37,823
Beware!

1486
01:52:48,495 --> 01:52:51,499
Brother, file a petition.

1487
01:52:51,532 --> 01:52:54,604
Sister I hope you understand
this is our last chance

1488
01:52:56,303 --> 01:52:58,613
Then let's put our
hean and soul to it.

1489
01:53:04,878 --> 01:53:05,856
Mr. Ravindra.

1490
01:53:05,879 --> 01:53:09,452
Sarbjifs family has been
on a hunger-strike since four days.

1491
01:53:09,516 --> 01:53:10,893
Did you come here
to give them assurance?

1492
01:53:11,318 --> 01:53:13,662
Mr. Ravindra, lwant to ask...

1493
01:53:23,397 --> 01:53:28,904
Mr. Ravindra...the entire
country's with Sarbjit.

1494
01:53:29,903 --> 01:53:31,905
Why not the government?

1495
01:53:31,938 --> 01:53:35,579
I promise you...even the
government's with you now.

1496
01:53:36,510 --> 01:53:38,490
In breaking news.

1497
01:53:38,545 --> 01:53:41,685
Ajmal Amir Kasab was hanged today.

1498
01:53:41,749 --> 01:53:43,888
Conditions critical in Pakistan.

1499
01:53:44,351 --> 01:53:47,355
We must to stop the
bloodshed on both the sides.

1500
01:53:47,387 --> 01:53:50,368
Even we have some criminals...

1501
01:53:50,424 --> 01:53:52,461
...whom Pakistan wants released.

1502
01:53:52,559 --> 01:53:55,836
What if we demand Afzal Guru's
freedom in return for Sarbjit?

1503
01:53:55,929 --> 01:53:59,809
One person who is responsible
for the attack at our parliament...

1504
01:53:59,933 --> 01:54:02,573
We don't want our fathers
freedom at the cost of his release...

1505
01:54:02,603 --> 01:54:05,743
Our beloved country is wonhy
of several such fathers sacrifice...

1506
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:09,377
International community has
condemned the hanging of Afzal Guru.

1507
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:11,447
Can't stand Indian democracy.

1508
01:54:11,545 --> 01:54:14,719
Indians declared Ajmal Kasab as terrorist
and hanged him within one year...

1509
01:54:14,781 --> 01:54:19,560
Then why have we still not
hanged Terrorist Sarbjit Singh...

1510
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:21,463
Blood should be repaid with blood!

1511
01:54:23,857 --> 01:54:25,564
That's our Chambail Singh.

1512
01:54:26,393 --> 01:54:27,770
More infidels will fall.

1513
01:54:28,462 --> 01:54:30,908
They'll kill one... we'll kill ten

1514
01:54:35,536 --> 01:54:36,810
Hurry UP-

1515
01:54:38,405 --> 01:54:40,385
Why don't you do it
at home before you leave?

1516
01:54:40,407 --> 01:54:41,545
You have to get busy anywhere.

1517
01:54:41,641 --> 01:54:42,585
Sit.

1518
01:54:42,643 --> 01:54:44,714
Do you have any idea...
I've to drop you at school...

1519
01:54:44,812 --> 01:54:45,882
...and get to the jail by 9.

1520
01:54:46,313 --> 01:54:49,317
I won't move until the Indian
High Commission doesn't arrive.

1521
01:54:49,516 --> 01:54:51,689
This is a limit.
Man is not safe even in jail.

1522
01:54:58,525 --> 01:54:59,526
Basheer

1523
01:55:03,597 --> 01:55:06,874
Basheer. Where are you taking me?

1524
01:55:06,934 --> 01:55:11,508
Basheer.

1525
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:16,418
I've lived my last 23years...
with the same hope...

1526
01:55:16,477 --> 01:55:19,924
That one day Sarbjit
will return to his country...

1527
01:55:20,347 --> 01:55:23,351
And sister has kept this hope alive.

1528
01:55:23,384 --> 01:55:26,558
I saw it 5 years ago.

1529
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:34,395
‘I've spent so many years in darkness,
that I dream even with my eyes open.

1530
01:55:37,597 --> 01:55:40,737
Today is the day when I am released.

1531
01:55:42,936 --> 01:55:48,943
Today I will return home...
to my people... to my land

1532
01:55:51,945 --> 01:55:54,357
Then by evening...

1533
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:56,761
I console myself again...

1534
01:55:58,752 --> 01:56:02,632
Tomorrow will be that day...

1535
01:56:03,623 --> 01:56:05,864
When I'll roam free...

1536
01:56:55,175 --> 01:56:55,676
Take this...

1537
01:56:55,742 --> 01:56:57,813
We have succeeded

1538
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:05,022
Come on, let's go.

1539
01:57:05,085 --> 01:57:08,191
Oh Allah...

1540
01:57:51,865 --> 01:57:53,640
Move back.

1541
01:57:55,635 --> 01:57:57,911
Move back.

1542
01:57:58,138 --> 01:58:00,516
I am his lawyer.

1543
01:58:04,044 --> 01:58:05,887
It's impossible to go inside.

1544
01:58:12,486 --> 01:58:13,191
Tell him.

1545
01:58:13,253 --> 01:58:15,028
It's impossible to go inside.

1546
01:58:15,089 --> 01:58:16,534
The situation is really bad.

1547
01:58:16,623 --> 01:58:19,536
The Taliban have issued
death warrants for all of them.

1548
01:58:19,593 --> 01:58:20,503
Go back.

1549
01:58:20,527 --> 01:58:21,904
Go...go back.

1550
01:58:21,961 --> 01:58:23,634
Please stay back. Please.

1551
01:58:25,198 --> 01:58:26,268
Aunt‘!-

1552
01:58:26,533 --> 01:58:28,035
Aunty.
- Sister...

1553
01:58:28,101 --> 01:58:29,637
Go back.

1554
01:58:29,703 --> 01:58:30,943
Stop it.
- Please stay back.

1555
01:58:30,971 --> 01:58:31,972
Stop it.

1556
01:58:32,706 --> 01:58:33,912
Stop it!

1557
01:58:38,011 --> 01:58:39,513
Stop it!

1558
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:41,684
Stop this madness.

1559
01:58:42,182 --> 01:58:44,662
At least let someone be human.

1560
01:58:45,919 --> 01:58:47,990
Shame on your anger!

1561
01:58:48,989 --> 01:58:50,969
Shame on your revenge!

1562
01:58:52,726 --> 01:58:54,637
You talk about justice!

1563
01:58:56,529 --> 01:58:58,975
You did what you wanted to.

1564
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:04,009
You staged an attack on a helpless,
unarmed prisoner inside the jail.

1565
01:59:04,171 --> 01:59:05,707
You call this justice?

1566
01:59:06,072 --> 01:59:08,052
It's a shame.

1567
01:59:10,677 --> 01:59:13,681
And now you've issued death
warrants for the four of us.

1568
01:59:14,214 --> 01:59:16,251
Go tell your Taliban...

1569
01:59:17,016 --> 01:59:18,723
Tell us the place and time.

1570
01:59:18,952 --> 01:59:20,989
This Sikhni will be there!

1571
01:59:22,756 --> 01:59:26,226
All you know is to stab in the back.

1572
01:59:27,261 --> 01:59:31,607
But we Indians never
learned to turn our backs!

1573
01:59:32,699 --> 01:59:34,076
I am right here.

1574
01:59:35,969 --> 01:59:40,008
If you have the courage,
then shoot me now.

1575
01:59:41,074 --> 01:59:42,348
Do you have the courage?

1576
01:59:43,243 --> 01:59:44,244
Do you?

1577
01:59:46,179 --> 01:59:47,749
Come, Sukh.

1578
01:59:49,216 --> 01:59:50,286
Move!

1579
01:59:54,054 --> 01:59:55,658
Move!

1580
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:22,650
You cannot go inside.

1581
02:00:22,749 --> 02:00:24,751
Sir, he's my brother too.
- Only family member.

1582
02:00:55,815 --> 02:00:57,226
You saw your brother, didn't you?

1583
02:00:57,284 --> 02:00:59,423
Leave now, time's up.

1584
02:01:00,053 --> 02:01:01,760
Come on, let us do our job.

1585
02:01:12,799 --> 02:01:19,080
Now you'll come back
to your country...

1586
02:01:21,241 --> 02:01:23,187
...your home.

1587
02:01:33,086 --> 02:01:37,193
Please come to my
house and stay there.

1588
02:01:38,258 --> 02:01:39,862
We're going to Delhi.

1589
02:01:40,093 --> 02:01:43,336
We'll request the government...
to treat papa at home.

1590
02:01:43,397 --> 02:01:44,774
Nothings right here.

1591
02:01:44,864 --> 02:01:46,070
Sister?

1592
02:01:46,466 --> 02:01:51,176
Do you know, his fingers moved.
I saw it myself.

1593
02:01:51,304 --> 02:01:53,147
But they say coma...

1594
02:01:53,473 --> 02:01:55,111
He can be treated here too.

1595
02:01:55,175 --> 02:01:56,347
Please try to understand.

1596
02:01:57,710 --> 02:01:59,815
Sister.

1597
02:02:01,314 --> 02:02:02,850
It's fine if you don't want to stay.

1598
02:02:02,916 --> 02:02:04,725
But don't worry about anything here.

1599
02:02:17,497 --> 02:02:19,374
There's a death warrant
issued in your name.

1600
02:02:19,432 --> 02:02:22,208
It's best that you leave
Pakistan along with your family.

1601
02:02:22,435 --> 02:02:25,507
This is my country...
and I won't run away from here.

1602
02:02:26,873 --> 02:02:30,446
Think like a father.

1603
02:03:10,784 --> 02:03:12,821
I promised him...

1604
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:15,798
...he'

 come back home.

1605
02:03:19,526 --> 02:03:21,164
Bring him back.

1606
02:03:24,364 --> 02:03:25,570
Bring him back.

1607
02:03:26,433 --> 02:03:28,344
The images you see on screen...

1608
02:03:28,401 --> 02:03:29,971
