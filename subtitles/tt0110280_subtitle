1
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:33,449
Salutations, Mr. Bheeshm Narain.
- Salutations, brother!

2
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:35,925
ls everything fine at home?
- Yes, thanks to God.

3
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:37,185
All right.

4
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:39,198
What happened to the
case about your land?

5
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:40,756
What has to happen,
Mr. Bheeshm Narain?

6
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:42,926
They are giving me date after date.

7
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:46,203
And l am tired going to
the court every now and then.

8
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:48,800
Can l tell you something?
- Yes, yes.

9
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,243
You along with Mr. Gandhi,
fought with bullets and sticks..

10
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:54,177
..and achieved freedom
for us from the British.

11
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:58,181
But the British rule
was better any day.

12
00:03:58,485 --> 00:03:59,816
Work was done immediately.

13
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:03,182
Nowadays, you have to
bribe to get your work done.

14
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,751
God knows what will
happen of this country.

15
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:17,863
l touch your feet, mother.
- Live long! Come, sit here

16
00:04:18,138 --> 00:04:19,469
Just like your grandfather, you..

17
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:22,599
..should also make
the family proud.

18
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,541
Here, take these offerings.
Very good!

19
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:29,915
Did you take your father's
blessings? - l will, mother.

20
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:32,481
First mother's blessings,
then father's blessings.

21
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:42,386
Son. - You know l don't like milk.

22
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:44,623
You will have to drink the milk.

23
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:47,861
lf you don't drink milk,
how will you grow strong?

24
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:50,732
Come on drink. Very good.
- Daughter-in-law.

25
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:57,272
Listen, is Pratap ready?
- l am ready, grandpa.

26
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:58,936
Regards grandpa.
- Live long.

27
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:01,340
But you will not drop me
off to school today.

28
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:04,144
l'll go to school myself.
You rest here.

29
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:09,351
He is exactly like his father,
the same habits.

30
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:11,820
Grandpa, don't you know
that you should never hit here.

31
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:14,890
You know the small brain lies here

32
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:16,890
lf you hit there, a person dies.

33
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:21,156
Okay, l made a mistake.
Go, go to school. You are late.

34
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:24,395
Okay, grandpa.
Mother, l am going. - Okay, son.

35
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:34,512
My young son died
serving the country.

36
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:38,140
Now l have only one dream.

37
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,518
That this freedom
fighter Bheeshm Narain..

38
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,423
..Tilak's grandson,
makes the family proud worldwide.

39
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:53,466
Wealthy one,
looks like today your luck is good.

40
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:54,864
You are getting all the money.

41
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:58,329
What has happened in your eyes?

42
00:05:58,471 --> 00:05:59,870
What will happen in my eyes?

43
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,836
There is something wrong.
Look at me.

44
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:06,875
Now look into my eyes.

45
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:20,517
You will now do as l say

46
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:22,754
Throw No.3. Hey, we won!

47
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:30,199
ldiot, gambles!

48
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,203
So you are the one who
has taught my son to gamble!

49
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:36,868
No, aunty, no. - l am not
going to listen to you today.

50
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,802
l went to the school
and l came to know..

51
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:40,641
..that my son has not gone
to school since twenty days!

52
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:41,806
Today l have come to know that..

53
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:44,111
..in your school this
is what is being taught.

54
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:47,450
What is the matter, father?
You look very upset.

55
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,147
Daughter-in-law,
it has become evening.

56
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:51,482
Pratap has not come home yet.

57
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,225
He'll come, father.
After school Pratap..

58
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,818
..goes for tuitions
to the master's house.

59
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:57,362
He was saying exams are nearing.

60
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:00,297
This time he will score
the highest marks in school.

61
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:03,358
He will. He will surely do that.

62
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:07,238
Daughter-in-law,
his eyes shine with confidence.

63
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,600
l tell you he will
one day become famous.

64
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,268
People far and wide
will be talking about him.

65
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:16,382
Yes, people will talk about him.

66
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:18,814
But not because of his good deeds.

67
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:20,113
But because of his bad deeds.

68
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:22,279
Master, please say good things.

69
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:23,617
What are you saying, master?

70
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,284
l am telling you the truth,
Mr. Bheeshm Narain.

71
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:30,295
l am trying to open your eyes.

72
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,728
You are talking about tuitions.

73
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,700
l have come to tell
you that for the..

74
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:38,260
..last twenty days,
he has not stepped in the school.

75
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:47,141
Sister Durga, Pratap met
me outside the village yesterday.

76
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:49,374
l asked him why he
was not coming to school.

77
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:53,484
So he told me grandpa
is very serious.

78
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,484
l am looking after
my grandpa day and night.

79
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,123
Hearing this, l came to enquire
after Mr. Bheeshm's health.

80
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:03,592
After coming here l find
the story is something else.

81
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:06,062
Master,
what rubbish are you talking?

82
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:07,360
Master is not talking rubbish,
sister Durga.

83
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:08,525
He is telling the truth.

84
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:11,764
Your son Pratap has taught
all the children to gamble.

85
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:15,097
Pratap has started gambling too?

86
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:20,238
A child from my family.
And that too gambling?

87
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:22,372
Yes, grandpa, near the river..

88
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:26,407
..in the ruins,
he gambles and also smokes.

89
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,588
Champa, what are you saying?

90
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:32,216
lf l am telling lies,
then l will rot in hell.

91
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:36,126
He himself is a scoundrel and
he is spoiling my only child also.

92
00:08:36,196 --> 00:08:38,562
Sister Durga, there is still time.

93
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:40,360
Correct your dear child.

94
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,264
Otherwise,
after years, there will be..

95
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,530
..a dacoit in this community
and that will be your son.

96
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:47,504
Oh God! Look at how the father,
grandfather were.

97
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:48,802
And look at how this
scoundrel grandson is.

98
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:53,141
Looks like he will spoil
the Tilak family's name.

99
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:01,179
Father! Father!

100
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:04,813
Father!

101
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:11,155
No! No! No!

102
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,794
A horrible thing has happened.

103
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:16,699
You are playing here and
your grandpa has expired there.

104
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,868
You are crying as
if your father has died.

105
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:21,366
lf he has died, so what?

106
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:22,738
Everybody has to
die someday, right?

107
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:24,606
You will die, l will die.

108
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:26,611
He is saved from the troubles
of this world, poor thing.

109
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:28,303
He has come to give me the news!

110
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:31,373
Strange boy! Don't you
know you have light the pyre?

111
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:34,451
lf l don't light the pyre,
will my grandpa not burn?

112
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:36,784
You stop worrying about
me and do your work.

113
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:40,522
Grandpa has gone to sleep forever.
You also go home and sleep.

114
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:50,602
Call the grandson
to light the pyre.

115
00:09:57,477 --> 00:10:00,378
Priest, l will light the pyre.

116
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,876
Mother?

117
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:41,211
You scoundrel!
lf you ever dare to say the..

118
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:43,582
..pure name of mother
from your lips..

119
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:44,782
..then l will cut your tongue.

120
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:49,351
From today neither you are my son,
nor am l your mother.

121
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:55,364
Today, these hands have
lit two pyres. - Mother!

122
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:59,494
What dreams your grandfather
and l had seen for you.

123
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:04,635
All those dreams have burnt
in the pyre. Did you hear?

124
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:07,574
Go away from my sight.
You are the murderer.

125
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,616
You have killed him.

126
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:12,708
l will not let you live.
l'll not let you live.

127
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:15,310
Sister Durga, let him go,
are you going to kill him?

128
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:18,323
Yes, l am going to kill him.
l will teach him a lesson.

129
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:21,588
lf you have my blood in your veins,
then go away from here.

130
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:24,289
Take your ashamed face
and don't ever come back.

131
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:32,234
lf you have drunk my milk,
then l give you the promise of..

132
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:34,364
..that milk, never come
back again in this village.

133
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,841
Don't even show me
your unlucky face again.

134
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:42,581
Just think that your mother
also died with your grandpa.

135
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:44,776
And you are also dead for me.

136
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:58,262
Look this is very nice, very good.

137
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:04,270
Don't go in the water, Atul.
Atul, don't go.

138
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:09,438
Don't go in the water, Atul.

139
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:13,741
Save Atul! Someone save him!

140
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:22,652
Somebody help me, somebody help me.

141
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:26,817
Save him! - Somebody help me!

142
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:38,365
Mr. Laxmidas, come outside!
Mr. Laxmidas, come outside.

143
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:39,837
Something horrible has happened.

144
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:43,433
What happened?
Why are you shouting so much?

145
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:47,468
Your son! No, he has not died.

146
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:51,643
Here he is. - Father, father!

147
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:54,709
What has happened to him?
What happened to my son?

148
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:57,320
What has happened to him?

149
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,482
He was drowning in the water, sir.

150
00:12:58,524 --> 00:12:59,923
This brave boy has saved him.

151
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:05,429
Son, l am so much in your debt.

152
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:09,362
That l cannot repay
it even with my life.

153
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:12,498
Here, take this reward.

154
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:16,436
Take this. Take this.

155
00:13:18,411 --> 00:13:21,847
Take this reward and go
have sweets in my son's name.

156
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:24,513
Hey, Mr. Dhaniya!
You are a real miser.

157
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:26,412
You are giving me five rupees?

158
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:28,454
l have saved the life of your son.

159
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:32,287
l will take full five hundred
rupees. Not a penny less or more.

160
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:37,159
You will take five hundred rupees?
Not a penny less or more? - Yes!

161
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:39,196
Mr. Dhaniya!
Don't hit me here, understand?

162
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:41,699
Why? - Here lies the small brain
of a person and a person dies.

163
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:43,894
What small and big?
You don't have any brains.

164
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:46,203
You don't have any humanity in you!

165
00:13:46,272 --> 00:13:48,365
For saving a life,
you will take five hundred rupees?

166
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:50,238
Mr. Dhaniya, l'm not going to..

167
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:51,674
..understand your
talk about humanity.

168
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:54,770
Just give me five green notes
of hundred quietly, then l'll go.

169
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,212
And if l don't give you?

170
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:58,910
No problem.
Tomorrow when l meet your son..

171
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:01,585
..l will tie a big stone round
his neck and drown him in the well.

172
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:06,182
And you can eat sweets
with this money. Miser!

173
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:10,728
Wait, wait!
Where are you going after counting?

174
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:15,324
Dear, here are your
five green notes.

175
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:17,435
l have understood your accounts.

176
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:21,496
And listen, don't come back
in this area to save anyone. Okay?

177
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:23,838
l have never done anything
even for my father.

178
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,400
Then who the hell are you?

179
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:27,742
Go, my father, go!

180
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:34,483
'Laxmidas,
look at the guts of the boy.'

181
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:39,552
'Look! A boy who can take
away your money, can do anything.

182
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:42,884
'He is very useful.
l shouldn't let him go.'

183
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:45,393
Hey! Come here.

184
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:47,724
Where do you stay?

185
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,268
Now l'm standing here, so
just think that this is my house.

186
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:54,571
Understood, understood!
You are alone in this world, right?

187
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,207
Who has no one in this world,
has Laxmidas.

188
00:14:58,844 --> 00:15:02,211
See, this community is mine,
so from today you are also mine.

189
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:04,245
From today you are my son.

190
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:07,144
And from today, you will
collect the rent of this community.

191
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:10,451
Here, Dhaniya. This month's
rent from the community.

192
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,514
Thirty two thousand eight hundred
eighty rupees and seventy five paise.

193
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:15,319
lt is less by seventy five paise.

194
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:17,419
Here it is. And it is less also
by one hundred and fifty rupees.

195
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:18,656
That Megha Dixit must have
not given it. - No, she has not.

196
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:21,666
l knew it. When this girl
first came to this community.

197
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:23,224
Alone. - Yes, alone.

198
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:26,430
l thought what will she eat,
where will she live.

199
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:28,735
You pitied her. - Where
will she stay, l pitied her.

200
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:31,299
This is what l did wrong, right?

201
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:33,572
Now when l ask her for the rent.
- She asks for papers.

202
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:34,670
She asks for papers.

203
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:37,238
She tells me your huts are.
- lllegal. - Yes, illegal.

204
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:39,716
l will write in the newspapers.
- l will go to the police.

205
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:41,480
lt is better to
be careful of such..

206
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:42,885
..people.
Yes, better to be careful.

207
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:44,248
Who is scared of such people?

208
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:45,881
But whenever she meets,
she starts lecturing.

209
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:48,786
One day if l get the chance,
l will show her.

210
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,692
Okay, you leave that,
talk about our ration.

211
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:52,923
What if l don't give you?

212
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,303
Did you forget?
Big stone, son, well? - Shut up!

213
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,329
Dhaniya, you should not hit here.

214
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:02,602
Yes, l know,
small brains lie there.

215
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:05,736
l know small brains lie there.
l am hitting you from childhood.

216
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:06,802
Have you died till now?

217
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:11,715
Here, take your five
green notes and have fun. Go.

218
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:17,155
Father, and my pocket money?
- Yes, come, come.

219
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,487
Come, you too come. He
has given me five hundred rupees.

220
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:21,390
See how it feels. See!

221
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:24,185
You idiot, the whole
day you don't do any work.

222
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:25,787
The whole day you are
polishing your motorbike.

223
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,135
Take this.
- What is this, hundred?

224
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:33,798
You are lucky. My father
used to give me ten rupees only.

225
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:37,299
You are lucky. Where will
you get a father like this?

226
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:39,708
Have fun, go have fun.

227
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:52,782
Wish his mother was alive today.

228
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:57,421
He has to bury his love
due to his father's miserliness.

229
00:16:57,496 --> 00:17:00,522
What can l do? Have you
seen such a miserly father? - No.

230
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:02,800
ls he going to take the
money with him when he dies? - No.

231
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:04,598
My mother died when l was a child.

232
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,729
l am the only son. And
only hundred rupees in my pocket?

233
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:08,569
ln today's world, what
can one do with hundred rupees?

234
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:10,768
Nothing. - To save money, he
didn't send me to college. - Yes.

235
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,301
Now he is going to
spoil my love life also.

236
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:14,368
How can he spoil your love life?

237
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:17,439
l will show you. Come here.
All of Mamta's love letters.

238
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,484
Each love letter costs
twenty five rupees.

239
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:21,746
She had spent twenty
five thousand for my birthday.

240
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:24,289
Now with hundred rupees,
how can l celebrate my birthday?

241
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:27,151
Can you manage with
these five hundred rupees?

242
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:28,215
What can l do with five hundred?

243
00:17:28,294 --> 00:17:29,625
This is nice,
when l am trying to help..

244
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:30,719
..you are taking
advantage of my kindness.

245
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:32,127
You don't understand..

246
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:33,756
..she is the daughter
of city's famous builder, Yograj.

247
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,596
She spends five hundred
rupees in a minute.

248
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:38,161
Please do something.

249
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:41,396
Convince father and
get five thousand rupees.

250
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,304
He will never say no to you.

251
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:46,470
Oh, Mamta's future husband.
You know your father very well.

252
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:48,376
lf his hair falls, he will
make toothbrush out of that..

253
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:50,244
..and brush his teeth with that.

254
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:51,749
Getting five thousand
out of him is like..

255
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:54,251
..snatching a hungry lion's meal.

256
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,514
l think he was born on 'Dhanteras'.

257
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:58,751
For everything,
he says, Laxmi, Laxmi, Laxmi.

258
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:00,291
lf you sending the
Goddess of wealth..

259
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,792
..send it in the form
of a daughter-in-law.

260
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:05,228
So that she comes
home and stays forever.

261
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:09,792
And blacken the face
of those who eye it, Goddess!

262
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:12,798
Hail Laxmi Narayan!

263
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:22,478
Pratap, you have stolen the money.

264
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:24,477
What are you saying?

265
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,848
l have lightened your father's
burden for a good cause.

266
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,108
And you call it stealing?

267
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:30,417
lf he dies, you are the
sole nominee of all this wealth.

268
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:32,480
Putting hands in one's
own pocket is not stealing.

269
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,854
lf father comes to know.
- lt will..

270
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:36,287
..be trouble. You don't know him.

271
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:38,262
l know him. He doesn't count money.
He weighs it.

272
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,298
He says if you count money,
it will become less.

273
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:43,096
The rent that comes every
month he keeps it like that.

274
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:49,837
Don't think, friend. Go spend.
Spend the money for Mamta.

275
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:53,109
We'll see what happens.

276
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:55,238
But you will also have
to come for the party.

277
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:57,748
Do one thing.
Take this chain, put on a shirt..

278
00:18:57,817 --> 00:18:59,307
..from the cupboard
and become sexy.

279
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:01,250
But where are we going?
- Love Rap.

280
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:04,514
You want to me to dance
like Michael Jackson? - Come on.

281
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:06,054
Love rap.

282
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:11,118
Love rap.

283
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:15,761
Love rap.

284
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,839
When l looked into your eyes.

285
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:58,406
Sometimes 101 sometimes 102.

286
00:19:58,477 --> 00:20:00,741
l've fever since that day.

287
00:20:00,813 --> 00:20:03,338
Sometimes 101 sometimes 102.

288
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:06,249
Go and call the doctor fast.

289
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:08,252
Show him my nerves.
Tell him about my condition.

290
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,618
Go and call the doctor fast.

291
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:13,749
Show him my nerves.
Tell him about my condition.

292
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,544
Wow!

293
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:45,215
Why does my heart beat fast?

294
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,521
lt's nothing but fever of love.

295
00:20:47,593 --> 00:20:50,221
Why does my heart beat fast?

296
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:52,662
lt's nothing but fever of love.
Beating!

297
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:55,230
My heart is beating.

298
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,827
Beating! My pulse is missing.

299
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,305
Beating! l think l'm collapsing.

300
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:02,337
Beating! Oh no l'm gone.

301
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:04,535
When l saw into your eyes.

Show him my nerves.
Tell him about my condition.

Why does my heart beat fast?

310

lt's nothing but fever of love.

311
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:34,164

We don't want money
we don't want fame.

315
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,720
We don't bungalow
we don't want car.

00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,693
We want only love,

Dance, my beloved.

321
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,510
Don't ask why l'm restless. Don't

322
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:26,785
Hello. - Hello.

Will you dance with me?

324
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:33,920
Hey! Look into my eyes

You know my age, its 30+9.

331
00:22:57,489 --> 00:22:59,650
Oh that means you are old wine.

332

No one knows what see.

333
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:04,458
Do not look at my age.

334
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,794
Don't look at me, you enchantress.

336

One day you'll be crazy for me.

00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:19,339
Come on. Come on.

339
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:28,849
Move aside. Don't mess with me.
Don't come near me, naughty women.

340
00:23:29,188 --> 00:23:31,782
Don't mess with me.
Don't come near me.

341
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:33,791
Move aside, naughty women.
Move aside

342
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:36,487
When l saw into your eyes.

343
00:23:36,562 --> 00:23:38,860
Sometimes 101 sometimes 102.

344
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:41,365
l've fever since that day.

345
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:44,129
Sometimes 101 sometimes 102.

346
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:46,398
Go and call the doctor fast.

347
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:48,702
Show him my nerves.
Tell him about my condition.

348
00:23:48,874 --> 00:23:51,274
Go and call the doctor fast.

349
00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:53,843
Show him my nerves.
Tell him about my condition.

350
00:23:53,912 --> 00:23:56,142
Why does my heart beat fast?

351
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:58,547
lt's nothing but fever of love.

352
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:00,881
Why does my heart beat fast?

353
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:03,348
lt's nothing but fever of love.

354
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:05,720
There should be no
generation gap in love.

355
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,316
Today we'll come together
and sing.

356
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:10,222
Love rap.

357
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:14,727
Love rap.

358
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:19,665
Love rap.

359
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:32,542
Come inside.

360
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:39,449
Sister, sister,
now only you can save us.

361
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:41,421
Police is against us,
law is against us, government..

362
00:24:41,627 --> 00:24:43,618
..officials are against us,
politicians are against us.

363
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:45,727
Please save us tribal, sister.

364
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:50,460
Sister, they are thinking
of opening a hotel there.

365
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:52,731
Till when will you people
live like this in fear?

366
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:55,397
What else can we
helpless people do?

367
00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:58,743
Police and goons together
will destroy the whole village.

368
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:01,408
Even if protest,
to whom should we do it?

369
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:04,144
This, this is your protest!

370
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:06,216
Tomorrow as soon as this
article is published in..

371
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:08,219
..the newspaper,
all the politicians will be shaken.

372
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:09,845
And all these people
who are begging..

373
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:12,090
..to you now will be your saviors.

374
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:15,593
Very good!
Journalist madam, very good!

375
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:17,128
She is going to save
the huts of the poor..

376
00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:19,130
..on the base of a newspaper.
Very good!

377
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:20,697
But those times are gone.

378
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:22,358
When people used to think
of the newspaper as mighty.

379
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:23,833
Now the newspaper
is just a business.

380
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:26,832
To earn money, they publish
any rubbish in the newspaper.

381
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:29,840
Warning of Balasaheb! Advani
is sentenced for indefinite exile!

382
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,308
lmam has been captured!

383
00:25:31,343 --> 00:25:33,106
All this rubbish will be there
in your newspaper now. - This is..

384
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:34,577
But all this is yours -
Did you know that small boys..

385
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:35,704
..shit in your newspaper
in the morning?

386
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:37,373
This is your misunderstanding.

387
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:38,843
The newspaper is very mighty.

388
00:25:39,151 --> 00:25:40,482
lt has the strength to
change the power of a nation.

389
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:43,713
lt brings revolution in
the minds of people who fear.

390
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:45,814
Where has the power
changed since 1947?

391
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:47,222
People who have not changed even..

392
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:48,316
..after reading the Gita,
Ramayana, Koran.

393
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:50,258
What revolution are they going to
bring after reading your newspaper?

394
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:52,320
They are in the habit
of sleeping from years.

395
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:53,557
Let them sleep! Let them sleep!

396
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:55,695
You just speak big things.

397
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:58,634
lf you have the guts, come forward.
Help the helpless. Awaken them.

398
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:01,639
You can only awaken live people,
not the dead.

399
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:03,231
Who is alive here?

400
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:05,509
There should be
no generation gap in love.

401
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:07,408
Today we'll sing together.

402
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,508
Love rap.

403
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,390
Sister Neha, my husband
has to go the factory to work.

404
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:25,225
Please let me fill the water first.
- Okay, fill it.

405
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:32,295
Sister, no one has to
go to work in your house.

406
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:33,702
ln our house all
have to go to work.

407
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:36,434
Please let me fill
the water first. - Okay.

408
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:58,855
Hey, you baldy, do only
that much good which is needed.

409
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:02,433
lf you do too much good,
you will remain thirsty.

410
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:14,144
Mr. Kalyan? - What is it?
-You are going to the toilet?

411
00:27:14,212 --> 00:27:15,543
Atleast give me a cigarette.

412
00:27:15,614 --> 00:27:17,275
l have only one cigarette, dear.

413
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:19,441
That too, l have taken
it from neighbour Mr. Hussein.

414
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:21,076
Then give that to me.

415
00:27:21,153 --> 00:27:23,587
lf l give it to you,
then l will have a problem there.

416
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:26,749
Why don't you understand? -
l understood, l understood, beggar.

417
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:29,726
Borrows and smokes,
cannot even buy a pack.

418
00:27:29,895 --> 00:27:32,455
Move, move, let me go first.

419
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:37,696
lf you don't allow me to go
first then l will have a problem.

420
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:40,761
He has run away with my bucket.
What will l do?

421
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,330
Mother, l am feeling hungry.
Come, mother.

422
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:45,467
Just coming.
Let me fill the water first.

423
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:48,470
Good morning, madam journalist.

424
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:51,209
Stupid! Eats and talks rubbish!

425
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:58,250
How are you, sister Neha?
- l am fine. First you fill.

426
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:03,794
That is also over.

427
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,066
See, today also
you didn't get water.

428
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:13,627
You come on time, even then.

429
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:16,402
And l come afterwards, even then.

430
00:28:21,413 --> 00:28:25,747
See baldy! l told you,
its right to walk with the times.

431
00:28:25,851 --> 00:28:27,751
People who walk ahead
of time are also thirsty.

432
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:29,377
And who come late are also thirsty.

433
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:31,513
See how l am. Always on time.

434
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:35,659
Mother, come.
l am hungry. - Coming.

435
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:38,719
See, baldy.
The future of our country.

436
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:40,459
Hungry and without clothes too.

437
00:28:40,532 --> 00:28:42,796
Here people get up in
the morning and ask for food.

438
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:45,098
Not for newspaper.

439
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:49,663
You are so smart!
Whatever you are telling me.

440
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:51,299
Why don't you tell the
people and make them understand.

441
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:53,241
Has it come in the
newspaper that l am smart?

442
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,279
Whatever comes
in my mouth l say it.

443
00:28:55,347 --> 00:28:58,373
But Pratap,
there is truth in whatever you say.

444
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,384
There is fire hidden
in whatever you say.

445
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,086
Why are you laughing?

446
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:03,781
lf you would tell these
things to the people..

447
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:05,648
..then why would l need
to write all this in a newspaper?

448
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:08,556
You say that the poor
don't read the newspaper.

449
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:10,456
But they can at
least hear your voice.

450
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:16,166
Listen to their voice now.
Now the good words will start.

451
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:20,295
ldiot, fool! Had you
gone to fill water or flirt?

452
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:22,829
Tell me, why don't you get water?

453
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:25,599
Everybody gets water.
How come you don't get it?

454
00:29:26,244 --> 00:29:28,644
Now how will you wash clothes,
utensils?

455
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:30,271
Help my mother, help my mother.

456
00:29:30,348 --> 00:29:32,213
Otherwise, aunt will kill her.

457
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:34,381
Listen Chhotu,
you can ask a person for help once.

458
00:29:34,453 --> 00:29:35,818
Every time if you ask for help,
you will get used to it.

459
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:37,646
Then for your whole life
you will be begging for help.

460
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:39,087
She is your mother.
Help her yourself.

461
00:29:39,157 --> 00:29:40,681
l am so small. What can l do?

462
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,126
You have broken bulbs on the road,
right? - Yes.

463
00:29:44,196 --> 00:29:45,185
Then why are you thinking so much?

464
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:46,525
Pick up a stone and
imagine that witch's..

465
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:47,656
..head to be the electric bulb,
and hit her.

466
00:29:47,732 --> 00:29:49,563
Problem will be solved forever.
Come on! Run.

467
00:29:52,404 --> 00:29:57,432
ldiot! You have killed my
brother and now you are on my head.

468
00:29:57,876 --> 00:29:59,366
Who hit me? Who hit me?

469
00:29:59,444 --> 00:30:01,173
What happened, sister?
- Leave me, you witch.

470
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,713
Who hit me?
Who hit me? Oh God, l am hurt!

471
00:30:06,518 --> 00:30:07,815
He has killed me.

472
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,287
You know how to do good,
and punish also.

473
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,885
You know very well whatjustice is?

474
00:30:14,392 --> 00:30:16,553
Then why are you
laughing for everything?

475
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:18,719
Awake, and awaken others also.

476
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:20,765
Again you are talking
about awakening.

477
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:22,891
Journalist madam,
l am falling at your feet.

478
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:24,226
Just let me eat simple food.

479
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:25,530
l don't want to be Gandhi,
l don't..

480
00:30:25,604 --> 00:30:26,662
..want to be Subhash Chandra Bose.

481
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:28,365
l am hungry. Just let me eat food.

482
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,566
Why are you after me?

483
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:33,443
She is ought to make
me a social worker.

484
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:34,604
Have you lost it?

485
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,306
She doesn't allow
me to have my breakfast.

486
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:39,272
Good morning, daddy.

487
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:47,784
Good morning, daddy.
- Yes, good morning.

488
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:51,556
lt is morning,
but you are still not awake.

489
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,258
8 o'clock.

490
00:30:55,934 --> 00:31:01,839
Daughter, if l don't get proper
sleep, my whole day goes bad.

491
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,535
Atleast make my day good first.

492
00:31:05,177 --> 00:31:08,476
l need some money. My college
is going on a trip to Shimla.

493
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:09,910
Money?

494
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:15,142
Here are the keys to the safe.

495
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,815
Take as much money as you want.
Thank you, daddy. - Go.

496
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,157
Hello? - Wake up from your sleep.

497
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:32,465
Wake up, Yograj.
And read today's newspaper.

498
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:35,271
Now your dream of making a hotel..

499
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,466
..in Khandwa village
will remain just a dream.

500
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:37,873
Being a minister, you are giving..

501
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:40,468
..me such a bad news
early in the morning.

502
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:41,809
You should be ashamed, Deshmukh.

503
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:43,403
Who has come in between us?

504
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:46,348
The journalist lady, Megha Dixit.
Who else?

505
00:31:47,352 --> 00:31:49,411
ln every newspaper of today,
with headlines..

506
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:53,389
..there is a big article for
the help of tribals. Read, read!

507
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:56,316
And you know she is
talked about even in Delhi.

508
00:31:56,728 --> 00:31:59,561
Just now l have received
a call for the help of Khandwa..

509
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:01,360
..village,
on the hotline from Delhi.

510
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:04,158
Now l will have to send
police to that village.

511
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:06,600
Then, is there no way
to remove the community?

512
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:09,469
There is only one way, Yograj.

513
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:12,403
And that is, Chatur Singh Chita.

514
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:46,868
Who was that?

515
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:48,412
Why has everybody become
quiet after seeing him?

516
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,572
Don't you know him? - No.

517
00:32:49,648 --> 00:32:51,240
That was Chatur Singh Chita!
- Really?

518
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:53,147
The don of the criminal world!

519
00:32:53,218 --> 00:32:54,549
Did you see the number
of his car? - No.

520
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:58,919
AlK No.1. - Meaning?
- lt means All lndia King No.1.

521
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,556
Really? - Wherever he goes,
there is silence.

522
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:05,085
Lucky number. 10 for 1. 10 for 1.

523
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:07,831
Come on!

524
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:13,266
Why did you stop, you rascal?

525
00:33:13,338 --> 00:33:14,566
lt was my number.

526
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:15,697
Quiet. - What?

527
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:33,148
Who was this rascal?

528
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:35,325
Someone new, Mr. Chatur Singh.

529
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:37,222
He had come just today to the club.

530
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:40,854
That is why he didn't know
about your rules and regulations.

531
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:46,434
Dayal, every person
who comes here should know.

532
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:52,241
That Chatur Singh Chita
doesn't like noise. - Yes, sir.

533
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:00,441
But Chandrasen, are you sure..

534
00:34:00,518 --> 00:34:02,509
..Chatur Singh will
solve our problem?

535
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:04,418
What are you..? - Quiet.

536
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,081
What are you talking
about solving, Yograj?

537
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,328
You have to think. Sit, sit.

538
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:14,454
Nowadays, a minister like
me doesn't go to God so much.

539
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,860
And more to Chatur Singh's door.

540
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:18,829
He is my godfather.

541
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:21,432
Chandrasen is talking
the absolute truth, Yograj.

542
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:23,398
According to Chatur
Singh's dictates.

543
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:24,601
Our ministry changes.

544
00:34:24,676 --> 00:34:28,373
Deshmukh,
who else do you want to change?

545
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:31,779
Salutations, sir!
- Salutations. Sit, sit.

546
00:34:32,317 --> 00:34:33,648
What is the matter?

547
00:34:33,785 --> 00:34:36,583
Early in the morning, the heads
of two parties are in my house.

548
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:39,523
Everything is alright
in the country, l hope!

549
00:34:39,557 --> 00:34:46,121
Meet him. This is our city's
famous builder, Mr. Yograj.

550
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:50,634
Very good man.
- Salutations! - Salutations!

551
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,604
Yes, minister and builder together?

552
00:34:56,474 --> 00:34:58,271
That means there is some problem.

553
00:34:58,343 --> 00:34:59,901
Not a big problem,
Mr. Chatur Singh.

554
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:02,511
lt is a problem of Khandwa
village's tribal community.

555
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:04,508
The awakening of tribals there..

556
00:35:04,582 --> 00:35:06,106
..has awakened the government.

557
00:35:06,184 --> 00:35:08,584
That is why l have been asked
to send a police force there.

558
00:35:08,653 --> 00:35:11,121
On the other hand,
Mr. Yograj's programme of..

559
00:35:11,189 --> 00:35:14,283
..Honeymoon Hotel is already fixed.

560
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:17,893
This is not a question of crores,
but millions and millions.

561
00:35:18,396 --> 00:35:22,230
And just like always,
you will have an equal share in it.

562
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,359
So what is the problem then?

563
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:28,602
You remove the police,
l'll remove the tribals.

564
00:35:28,673 --> 00:35:32,336
But how can we remove the police?

565
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,501
The police has been sent by
Mr. Deshmukh himself.

566
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:36,240
But what else could l have done?

567
00:35:36,848 --> 00:35:39,840
l had got orders from above,
what could l have done?

568
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:43,245
Sending police anywhere
is the work of politicians.

569
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:47,680
And removing them is the
work of smart people like us.

570
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,793
What? What did you say?

571
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:57,692
Such a major incident
has occurred in the city.

572
00:35:57,769 --> 00:35:59,327
And you are worried
about Khandwa village.

573
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:00,597
What kind of a
commissioner are you?

574
00:36:01,105 --> 00:36:03,232
Listen, listen to me.

575
00:36:03,308 --> 00:36:07,802
Put the full police force
for peace and security of the city.

576
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,105
And the police force that
you have sent to Khandwa village.

577
00:36:11,182 --> 00:36:13,548
Call them back here.
That is my order.

578
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:15,779
But in this condition if
anything happens there, then?

579
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:18,180
Whenever it happens there,
we'll see.

580
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:21,316
Now it is happening here,
you see here, think of here.

581
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:23,688
And don't try to explain to me.

582
00:36:24,162 --> 00:36:25,754
Just remove the police from
Khandwa village. That is all.

583
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:36,165
Stop! Before you drive
the tractor on this community.

584
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:37,833
You will have to
go over my dead body!

585
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:40,407
Ms. Megha, please save us.

586
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:42,536
See this, they are
scaring us with their guns.

587
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:43,672
And making us homeless.

588
00:36:43,748 --> 00:36:45,181
They are destroying our community.

589
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,152
Help us, Ms.
Megha. Yes, help us, Ms. Megha.

590
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,585
You all are cowards!

591
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:54,216
The whole village can't
get together and face 10-15 goons.

592
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:57,159
Hey you brave girl,
if l just give..

593
00:36:57,228 --> 00:36:58,718
..you one, you'll be knocked out!

594
00:36:59,197 --> 00:37:00,289
Who are you to come in between us?

595
00:37:00,365 --> 00:37:02,162
Pakya, she is the same journalist.

596
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:03,632
Yes, l am the same journalist.

597
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:05,134
And your threatening
is not going to work here.

598
00:37:05,203 --> 00:37:06,636
You hired goons!

599
00:37:06,704 --> 00:37:08,262
Come on get out from here!

600
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:18,109
Let the bull dozer go and
destroy the whole community.

601
00:37:57,455 --> 00:38:01,391
Salutations! - Salutations, come.

602
00:38:02,126 --> 00:38:03,491
Did you see the might of the pen?

603
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:07,053
lf the press rights any rubbish..

604
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:08,496
..even they are beaten up nowadays.

605
00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:13,101
Looks like after your writing,
wrong people have awakened.

606
00:38:14,205 --> 00:38:15,331
What did you get?

607
00:38:16,107 --> 00:38:18,337
A cot in a municipal hospital.

608
00:38:18,643 --> 00:38:20,770
Here not the doctor but
mosquito tests your blood.

609
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:24,478
lf you protest,
this is what happens.

610
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:25,538
And if you go on
a hunger strike, then.

611
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:27,608
The police comes and pours
sweet lime juice in your mouth.

612
00:38:28,186 --> 00:38:29,380
Why don't you let it go?

613
00:38:29,487 --> 00:38:32,786
Do a safe job.
Typing. Do you know typing?

614
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:35,453
Have you come to
see me or taunt me?

615
00:38:35,526 --> 00:38:37,187
No, not to taunt.
l have come to tell you.

616
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:41,387
You had gone to that
tribals in Khandwa, right?

617
00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:42,865
To see that place? - Yes.

618
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:45,499
Now it has become a flat land.

619
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:48,228
Children are playing
on that land now.

620
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,804
After some days,
a resort will come up, a big hotel.

621
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:55,201
Foreigners will come..
to study lndian culture.

622
00:38:55,513 --> 00:38:59,244
Then, they will click the
photos of our naked tribals.

623
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:04,387
And will show,
darling, this is lndia. Bad taste.

624
00:39:04,656 --> 00:39:06,055
What are you trying to say?

625
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:07,523
What should l say?

626
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:11,556
Atul, sit,
this is between all of us.

627
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:16,160
Sit. - Actually. - What?

628
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:20,498
Actually, the problem is..

629
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:24,438
What actually? Talk in Hindi.

630
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:27,501
Actually, if it snows in Shimla,
he will commit suicide.

631
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:30,413
lf it snows in Shimla,
he will commit suicide?

632
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:32,449
Yes, Mamta has gone to Shimla.

633
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:34,109
lf it snows, she will feel cold.

634
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:35,482
lf she feels cold, he will be sad.

635
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:36,815
lf he is sad,
he will commit suicide. - Oh!

636
00:39:37,088 --> 00:39:40,251
He wants to go there.
The money for fare? The bus fare.

637
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:45,392
Fare? You want the bus fare?
You want a loan?

638
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:51,163
No, not loan.
- Then? - Here, fruits. Rs.30.

639
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:54,398
Thank you.
Thank you. How sweet, why did you?

640
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:59,576
This is was my duty. l have
paid Rs.30 for it. What is Rs.30?

641
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:03,671
The thing of not paying
rent is lawfully wrong. - Yes.

642
00:40:03,748 --> 00:40:06,581
And you have not paid the rent
for last 3 years, so l thought..

643
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:08,243
Have you come to teach me the law?

644
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,345
ln this state of mine,
you have come to collect your rent?

645
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:14,289
Get out from here,
get out from here!

646
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:17,759
You bloody fool, get out from here!

647
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:19,160
Didn't l tell you it
would not serve any purpose?

648
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,288
Unnecessarily our thirty
rupees was also wasted.

649
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:22,628
Strange girl, instead of flowers,
she throws fruits.

650
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:24,428
Now what will happen
about my going to Shimla?

651
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,861
Dr. Vishwnath? - Yes.

652
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,864
Dr. Vishwanath!
- Yes, what is the matter?

653
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:32,273
Dr. Vishwanath!

654
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:33,605
You are the one who
comes to Abhinav chemists..

655
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:34,906
..and sells injections
and medicines stealthily..

656
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:36,703
..from the hospital right?
- Keep quiet!

657
00:40:36,781 --> 00:40:38,544
Don't say a word,
l know everything.

658
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:40,777
You sell blood from the hospital.
l will tell everyone.

659
00:40:40,852 --> 00:40:42,251
Don't open your mouth.

660
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,412
lf you don't want me to open
my mouth, then open your purse.

661
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:44,512
How much do you have?

662
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:45,647
Only 500.

663
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:47,850
You idiot you earn
so much and keep so little.

664
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:49,256
Don't tell outside, please.
Just go.

665
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:50,589
l usually don't take money from..

666
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:52,687
..dirty persons like you
but what to do, l am in need.

667
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:55,390
500. - What will l
do with only this much?

668
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:56,899
Don't worry,
l will take you everywhere. Come.

669
00:40:58,503 --> 00:41:02,269
Lucky number. One for ten. Try it.

670
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,503
Come on. One for ten.

671
00:41:10,448 --> 00:41:12,109
Here also there is a baldy.

672
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:16,750
Madam, looks like today
luck is not in your favour.

673
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:19,381
Come on Pratap,
let's go somewhere else.

674
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:21,755
Wait, let's try with 500. lf
we win, fine, otherwise it's okay.

675
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:23,589
All that we have grabbed is 500.

676
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:25,151
lf we lose even that, we won't
have money for the petrol too.

677
00:41:25,229 --> 00:41:26,560
Who looks for petrol at night?

678
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:29,526
You also have got Dhaniya's habit.

679
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,567
Don't you know
the small brain lies here?

680
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:31,727
Yes, l know.
- Let's go.

681
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:35,199
Hey Baldy! - Yes.

682
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:38,307
Wearing spectacles in the
day and fooling people, is it?

683
00:41:38,676 --> 00:41:39,870
ls your eyesight alright?

684
00:41:40,144 --> 00:41:42,237
My eyesight is perfectly alright.

685
00:41:42,313 --> 00:41:44,304
l feel there is a
problem in your eyes.

686
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:46,614
What rubbish are you talking?
Who are you?

687
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:47,875
Don't you know him?

688
00:41:48,286 --> 00:41:53,519
He is the city's well-known
eye specialist, Dr. Jhunjhunwala.

689
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:57,320
Dr. Jhunjhunwala?
Please forgive me, doctor.

690
00:41:57,395 --> 00:41:59,625
Please tell me what
is wrong with my eyes?

691
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:01,665
Look into my eyes.

692
00:42:07,104 --> 00:42:10,267
Now you will do as l say.

693
00:42:15,513 --> 00:42:19,210
Atul, put the 500.

694
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:23,383
So this is my 500 on number 31.

695
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:33,462
31, 1 on 3, turn the wheel.

696
00:42:52,216 --> 00:42:53,808
We won!

697
00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:56,619
Give, give. - Here is your 5000.

698
00:42:57,188 --> 00:42:59,656
Baldy, how much is it for 5000?

699
00:42:59,891 --> 00:43:01,882
50,000. - Atul. - Yes.

700
00:43:02,193 --> 00:43:04,684
Then turn the wheel
of 5,000 on number 33.

701
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:25,910
You won 50,000!
You will go to Shimla.

702
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:31,382
You won 50,000. You will sing now.

703
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,747
Flowers! Buds!

704
00:44:05,256 --> 00:44:07,417
Moon and stars.

705
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:10,420
Flowers! Buds!

706
00:44:10,528 --> 00:44:12,655
Moon and stars.

707
00:44:13,397 --> 00:44:16,889

Your names.

712
00:44:28,846 --> 00:44:31,178
Fragrance and wind.

713
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:33,849
Colors and scenery.

714
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:36,244
Fragrance and wind.

715
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,854
Colors and scenery.

716
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:43,221
What are they?

717
00:44:44,662 --> 00:44:47,256
Your names.

718
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:49,799
Your names.

719
00:44:50,134 --> 00:44:52,625
Your names.

720
00:44:52,703 --> 00:44:54,898
Your names.

721
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:31,569
Be careful in the journey of love.

722
00:45:31,642 --> 00:45:36,875
Friends,
l know how to control myself.

723
00:45:42,186 --> 00:45:47,351
Support me when l fall down.

724
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:52,795
Don't act crazy.

725
00:45:52,897 --> 00:45:57,800
The sweet dream seems a reality.

726
00:45:58,335 --> 00:46:02,795
l like staying in your arms.

727
00:46:08,345 --> 00:46:10,677
Sunshine. Clouds.

728
00:46:10,848 --> 00:46:13,373
Shade and sun.

729
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:15,883
Sunshine. Clouds.

730
00:46:16,253 --> 00:46:18,619
Shade and sun.

731
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:22,719
What are they?

732
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:26,695
Your names.

733
00:46:26,831 --> 00:46:29,561
Your names.

734
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,260
Your names.

735
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:34,529
Your names.

736
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:10,836
My innocence fooled me.

737
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:16,478
Your image is always in my eyes.

738
00:47:21,552 --> 00:47:26,819
How long will you love me this way?

739
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:32,158
As long as sun shines in the sky.

740
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:37,323
Don't make false promises.

741
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:42,504
Always get ready only for me.

742
00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:49,609
River and lotus.

743
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:52,611
Waves and the shores.

744
00:47:53,117 --> 00:47:55,278
River and lotus.

745
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:58,147
Waves and the shores.

746
00:47:58,422 --> 00:48:02,324
What are they?

747
00:48:03,694 --> 00:48:06,162
Your names.

748
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:08,663
Your names.

749
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:11,567
Your names.

750
00:48:11,635 --> 00:48:13,830
Your names.

751
00:48:14,104 --> 00:48:16,197
Flowers.

752
00:48:16,507 --> 00:48:18,839
Moon and the stars.

753
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,440
Fragrance and wind.

754
00:48:21,779 --> 00:48:24,247
Colors and scenery.

755
00:48:24,615 --> 00:48:28,278
What are they?

756
00:48:29,753 --> 00:48:32,415
Your names.

757
00:48:32,523 --> 00:48:35,117
Your names.

758
00:48:35,192 --> 00:48:37,752
Your names.

759
00:48:38,128 --> 00:48:40,187
Your names.

760
00:48:49,873 --> 00:48:52,137
Our Shimla trip is
going to be a remembrance.

761
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:56,209
And there, l don't know
how Pratap is doing with Dad.

762
00:48:56,313 --> 00:49:00,374
You have cheated me. Where
is my 5000? Where is my money?

763
00:49:00,451 --> 00:49:01,782
l stole the money.
But for a good cause.

764
00:49:01,852 --> 00:49:03,683
What good cause? What good cause?

765
00:49:03,754 --> 00:49:06,655
You will become a rich man.

766
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,350
What rich man? You will
turn a rich man to a poor man.

767
00:49:09,426 --> 00:49:10,688
Get out! - Listen to me.

768
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:13,662
You will not live in my house.
Get out!

769
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:15,699
Let me eat first,
and then push me out. - Get out!

770
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:17,666
There is no food or water
for you in my house. Get out!

771
00:49:26,777 --> 00:49:29,507
Salutations, lsmail-bhai!
- Salutations, Kalyan-bhai!

772
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:35,150
Kalyan-bhai,
someone has said the truth.

773
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:39,153
lf your stomach is empty.
Then your sleep also goes away.

774
00:49:39,223 --> 00:49:42,852
Who are you taunting?
l have not come to beg from you.

775
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:44,788
Lakhs of people sleep
on an empty stomach.

776
00:49:45,129 --> 00:49:46,790
lf l sleep on an empty
stomach one day, l will not die.

777
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:48,725
And don't talk too much.

778
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,199
l will remove the few strands
of hair left on your head.

779
00:49:51,669 --> 00:49:52,795
Go, you go.

780
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:57,871
Pratap! - Yes.
- Will you have a cigarette?

781
00:49:58,142 --> 00:49:59,166
Once l asked him for a cigarette.

782
00:49:59,243 --> 00:50:00,403
Now you think l am a beggar.

783
00:50:00,444 --> 00:50:03,345
Here, keep this whole pack.
You will need it in the morning.

784
00:50:03,414 --> 00:50:04,472
Keep it, keep it.

785
00:50:04,548 --> 00:50:06,607
l had gone mad trying
to wake up a sleeping tiger.

786
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:07,912
Want a cigarette!

787
00:50:10,654 --> 00:50:12,383
l have brought food for you.

788
00:50:24,568 --> 00:50:26,934
Have you eaten?
- Yes, mother had half and..

789
00:50:27,204 --> 00:50:29,695
And half of her share
she sent it for me, right?

790
00:50:31,308 --> 00:50:32,570
Listen, Chhotu,
till today l have not..

791
00:50:32,643 --> 00:50:34,372
..taken anyone
else's share of food.

792
00:50:35,179 --> 00:50:37,170
Go feed your mother
with your own hands. Go!

793
00:50:37,214 --> 00:50:38,374
Can l ask you one thing, uncle?

794
00:50:39,817 --> 00:50:41,876
What did you say? - Uncle.

795
00:50:44,822 --> 00:50:46,312
Very good, Chhotu!

796
00:50:46,824 --> 00:50:50,726
l had forgotten relations.
You reminded me.

797
00:50:52,463 --> 00:50:54,328
Okay, Chhotu,
ask what you want to know.

798
00:50:54,598 --> 00:50:56,657
During childhood, if your mother..

799
00:50:56,734 --> 00:50:59,225
..must have told you stories,
please tell me some.

800
00:51:14,184 --> 00:51:15,446
Go feed your mother. Go!

801
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:16,713
Tell me a story, please!

802
00:51:17,521 --> 00:51:19,819
Leave me!
- Go away from here, you witch!

803
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,357
l'll see how you
don't go from here!

804
00:51:21,425 --> 00:51:25,828
Mother! Leave my mother.

805
00:51:25,896 --> 00:51:28,558
Put her in the jeep.
- Rescue my mother.

806
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:30,897
Help me!

807
00:51:31,168 --> 00:51:34,194
Those people took away my mother.
Please save her.

808
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,399
Save my mother.
Otherwise, they will take her away.

809
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:41,501
Save my mother. Save my mother.

810
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:53,954
l spit on you!

811
00:51:54,658 --> 00:51:56,853
ln front of everyone
a widow is being shamed.

812
00:51:57,528 --> 00:51:59,462
And you are laughing away to glory!

813
00:51:59,563 --> 00:52:01,258
Uncle, save my mother, uncle.

814
00:52:01,331 --> 00:52:03,094
What will he save me?

815
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:06,569
He is just laughing
at a woman's helplessness.

816
00:52:07,704 --> 00:52:09,763
Even a woman will not
be ashamed to become a..

817
00:52:10,307 --> 00:52:13,902
..prostitute rather than
if she sees his poisonous laugh.

818
00:52:14,178 --> 00:52:16,840
Keep quiet! You should be ashamed.

819
00:52:16,914 --> 00:52:19,246
Today l'll save you.
Who will save you tomorrow?

820
00:52:22,486 --> 00:52:25,216
A woman does not sit in
a brothel because she is helpless.

821
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:27,382
But because she does
not want to fight.

822
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:32,227
Everyone has become habitual
of living like a dog.

823
00:52:32,629 --> 00:52:34,859
lf you want to live in dignity, then
learn to fight your own battles.

824
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:39,565
God has given you hands.
You start begging.

825
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:41,263
You have a mouth so you
start shouting for help.

826
00:52:41,338 --> 00:52:43,272
Help. Help.
Who will come to help you?

827
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:46,309
You have teeth not only to eat.
Bite him.

828
00:52:46,376 --> 00:52:48,367
Pick up that stick. Break his head.

829
00:52:48,445 --> 00:52:50,606
And we will watch the fun.
Why journalist, madam?

830
00:52:55,352 --> 00:52:58,412
You want to sell a woman?

831
00:53:01,525 --> 00:53:03,220
l will not spare you.

832
00:53:03,293 --> 00:53:07,491
Scoundrels! ldiot!

833
00:53:13,237 --> 00:53:16,536
You have troubled me a lot.
You were going to sell me! - Leave me.

834
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:21,374
You were beating me! From
tomorrow you will fill the water.

835
00:53:21,445 --> 00:53:24,812
Yes, l will go.
Leave me, leave me.. Help me.

836
00:53:24,882 --> 00:53:28,215
Where are you going? Open the door.

837
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:31,512
Come let's watch.
lt's really a miracle.

838
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:34,250
See, Pratap. Did you see
the strength of your voice?

839
00:53:34,391 --> 00:53:37,292
Only you can bring a
revolution in their lives.

840
00:53:37,361 --> 00:53:41,297
Forget revolution! Here to light
a cigarette, l borrow matches.

841
00:53:41,365 --> 00:53:43,629
You are talking about revolution,
Who is it? - Your father, come.

842
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,191
Come on everybody go home.

843
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:49,135
Kalyan, lsmail. He has
got spoilt because of you all.

844
00:53:49,206 --> 00:53:50,730
l am your accountant.
What are you doing?

845
00:53:50,908 --> 00:53:53,638
What were you doing there?
Always with goons.

846
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:55,644
You idiot!
Don't you get to eat food?

847
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:58,510
What are you doing? - Don't hit here.
My small brains lie there.

848
00:53:58,582 --> 00:53:59,742
A man can die.

849
00:53:59,816 --> 00:54:02,341
l have not eaten food
because of you. Come on.

850
00:54:05,522 --> 00:54:06,614
Why are you laughing?

851
00:54:07,157 --> 00:54:08,146
Why are you laughing?

852
00:54:08,225 --> 00:54:09,783
l can't understand your character.

853
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,191
Then don't understand.

854
00:54:11,261 --> 00:54:16,221
Tell me one thing. Have you
both been gambling with my money?

855
00:54:16,266 --> 00:54:18,791
No, no. - Have not been drinking?

856
00:54:18,869 --> 00:54:23,363
No, no. - You smell of cigarette.
Close your mouth.

857
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,801
Are you going to prostitutes?

858
00:54:25,842 --> 00:54:29,471
Madam journalist, see how he
is talking bad things to a child?

859
00:54:29,546 --> 00:54:33,243
Quiet, quiet!
Don't do such bad things, okay!

860
00:54:33,784 --> 00:54:36,446
Then have you put
my money in films?

861
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:40,589
One crores is confirmed.
Come, let's eat food and sing.

862
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:42,850
You are my only daughter Mamta.

863
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,727
That is why l know
that if you have..

864
00:54:46,797 --> 00:54:48,788
..chosen a boy then
he must be a diamond.

865
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:52,158
ls he a business magnate
or industrialist?

866
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:56,401
No, daddy. Not any of them.

867
00:54:56,573 --> 00:54:59,201
Then surely he must
be an officers' son.

868
00:54:59,543 --> 00:55:02,706
An income tax officer's,
custom collector's or

869
00:55:02,779 --> 00:55:06,806
..police commissioner's
or maybe a Major General's?

870
00:55:07,851 --> 00:55:09,580
He is not a son
of any of these, too.

871
00:55:09,653 --> 00:55:13,111
Really? Then he must
be a minister's, doctor..

872
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:16,626
..or engineer's son? - No.

873
00:55:18,095 --> 00:55:21,496
Then whose son is he?
He is from a poor family.

874
00:55:21,565 --> 00:55:25,296
He lives in a hut.
- Yes. - What do you mean?

875
00:55:25,702 --> 00:55:28,603
City's famous builder
Yograj's only daughter.

876
00:55:28,872 --> 00:55:31,306
Will become a bride
and go to live in a hut?

877
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:34,133
Not at all! This is impossible!

878
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:38,177
Daddy, you must have heard
the name of Laxmi community?

879
00:55:38,348 --> 00:55:41,215
Yes, l have heard.
lt is a rotten hutment..

880
00:55:41,284 --> 00:55:42,478
..in the middle of the city.

881
00:55:42,552 --> 00:55:44,247
He lives there, doesn't he?

882
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:46,486
You are saying the
name of Laxmi community.

883
00:55:46,556 --> 00:55:49,116
As if all the rich
men in the city live there!

884
00:55:49,926 --> 00:55:55,193
Daddy, he is the son of
Laxmi community's head, Laxmidas.

885
00:55:55,265 --> 00:56:02,296
He is our Lachhu's son. But
you were saying he lives in a hut.

886
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:06,435
He is the owner of Laxmi community!

887
00:56:07,244 --> 00:56:10,611
Very good, child!
l appreciate your choice.

888
00:56:11,148 --> 00:56:13,810
Just think that your
marriage is fixed. - Yes!?

889
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:16,678
l'll go tomorrow itself
and talk to Lachhu.

890
00:56:16,887 --> 00:56:20,288
So you are happy?
- Thank you, daddy. Thanks.

891
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:29,721
Well done, child, well done!
You have hit the jackpot.

892
00:56:31,401 --> 00:56:34,199
To turn Laxmi community into a..

893
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:36,262
..Yograj community is
a very old dream of mine.

894
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,509
Because of you l can see
that dream turning to reality.

895
00:56:45,282 --> 00:56:50,777
Lachhu! - Yogu!
- Lachhu, my dear friend!

896
00:56:50,854 --> 00:56:54,483
You look the same, thin as always.

897
00:56:54,725 --> 00:56:58,593
l thought that when a man
makes money, he becomes fat.

898
00:56:59,663 --> 00:57:01,597
Seeing you l'm
recalling our childhood.

899
00:57:01,665 --> 00:57:04,691
Remember? You used to
make small houses from mud.

900
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:09,704
And today! Today you are the
city's most famous builder Yograj!

901
00:57:10,874 --> 00:57:13,138
Leave all that.
Look here. This is Gyanchand.

902
00:57:13,443 --> 00:57:17,539
Yes, l have heard a lot
about Gyanchand's knowledge.

903
00:57:17,614 --> 00:57:21,550
ln your business, is there
any work outside his knowledge?

904
00:57:21,618 --> 00:57:22,642
lsn't it true?

905
00:57:23,553 --> 00:57:26,488
Keep the comb inside!
He has got a very bad habit.

906
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:32,521
Come, come. Come, sit.

907
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:38,123
So friend tell me, what will
you have, tea or something cold?

908
00:57:38,201 --> 00:57:40,635
Nothing. - l will have oval tine.
- We don't have it at home.

909
00:57:40,704 --> 00:57:42,535
This is another bad habit of his.

910
00:57:43,406 --> 00:57:47,172
See, Lachhu.
You know me from childhood? - Yes.

911
00:57:47,444 --> 00:57:49,537
l don't have the habit
of talking in circles. - Yes.

912
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,772
You have a son and
l have a daughter.

913
00:57:53,216 --> 00:57:58,848
Whatever is yours is mine.
And whatever is mine is yours.

914
00:58:00,657 --> 00:58:06,095
That means whatever is yours
is mine? - Yes. - How is that?

915
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:07,728
lt is a straight forward matter.

916
00:58:08,198 --> 00:58:10,189
All my property is my daughter's.

917
00:58:10,267 --> 00:58:11,700
And after her marriage.

918
00:58:11,768 --> 00:58:13,326
l mean to say everything
will be my son-in-law's.

919
00:58:13,403 --> 00:58:15,598
Look friend,
if you talk about give and take..

920
00:58:15,672 --> 00:58:16,798
..we will not get along.

921
00:58:16,873 --> 00:58:19,603
That is why l have thrown
my son out of the house.

922
00:58:19,676 --> 00:58:21,769
Your daughter is like my daughter.

923
00:58:21,845 --> 00:58:23,574
Send her in one pair of clothes.

924
00:58:23,647 --> 00:58:27,242
l don't want a single penny
in dowry. Do you understand? - No.

925
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:30,616
That's great! And all
that l have earned all my life.

926
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:32,154
For whom is it? - l don't know.

927
00:58:32,222 --> 00:58:37,387
l have decided. l will be
giving Mamta one crore in cash.

928
00:58:40,831 --> 00:58:45,165
One crore in cash?
- 40-50 lakhs worth jewellery.

929
00:58:45,569 --> 00:58:48,868
A small bungalow, worth 3 crores.

930
00:58:49,339 --> 00:58:51,239
All this l have put
in my daughter's name.

931
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:55,474
40-50 lakhs worth jewellery,
that means one and half crores.

932
00:58:55,712 --> 00:58:59,239
And 3 crores worth bungalow.
4 and half crores!

933
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:03,853
Rest there must be Atleast
2-3 crores in her bank account.

934
00:59:04,354 --> 00:59:07,255
Now being a father l cannot
look after all that, right?

935
00:59:07,557 --> 00:59:11,288
3 crores' bank balance?
7 and a half crores!

936
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:15,422
l have spent money on other's
wedding all my life. - Yes.

937
00:59:15,465 --> 00:59:18,491
Now they will also give
at my daughter's wedding, right?

938
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:20,160
Yes, of course! Why won't they?

939
00:59:20,237 --> 00:59:23,638
That may be around 40-50 lakhs.

940
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:28,304
40-50 lakhs in gift!
7 and half crores and 50?

941
00:59:28,345 --> 00:59:30,336
That means she is
going to bring 8 crores!

942
00:59:30,647 --> 00:59:34,640
Now you don't say no and
break the two lovers' heart.

943
00:59:34,718 --> 00:59:36,652
How can l say no, buddy?

944
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,689
But yes or no will
be decided by you, right?

945
00:59:39,756 --> 00:59:41,587
l can do anything for my daughter.

946
00:59:41,658 --> 00:59:45,253
Whenever you say yes, we will
get both of them married. - Right.

947
00:59:52,102 --> 00:59:55,333
My scarf got blown away my dear.

948
00:59:55,405 --> 00:59:58,431
lt has exposed your body.

949
00:59:59,709 --> 01:00:05,375
The weather has teased me.
The wind has gone crazy.

950
01:00:05,582 --> 01:00:08,710
lt has exposed your body.

951
01:00:08,785 --> 01:00:12,653
My scarf got blown away my dear.

952
01:00:13,356 --> 01:00:19,261
The weather has teased me.
The wind has gone crazy.

953
01:00:32,275 --> 01:00:38,339
My beloved. Come here.
My heart is crazy.

954
01:00:42,152 --> 01:00:48,216
My beloved. Come here.
My heart is crazy.

955
01:00:48,491 --> 01:00:55,420
Look at me. Tease me.
The atmosphere is lovely.

956
01:00:55,632 --> 01:01:02,299
Beloved, this is
the first monsoon of our love.

957
01:01:02,405 --> 01:01:08,708
Heart is crazy for love.

958
01:01:08,912 --> 01:01:12,404
My heart is getting swayed..

959
01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:14,517
lt's not in control.

960
01:01:14,584 --> 01:01:18,247
My scarf got blown away my dear.

961
01:01:18,388 --> 01:01:21,357
lt has exposed your body.

962
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:28,757
The weather has teased me.
The wind has gone crazy.

963
01:01:59,763 --> 01:02:06,464
l'm beautiful. You are young.
We should not commit any mistake.

964
01:02:06,636 --> 01:02:12,836
What has happened? What can l do?
My impatience keeps increasing.

965
01:02:16,713 --> 01:02:23,448
l'm beautiful. You are young.
We should not commit any mistake.

966
01:02:23,586 --> 01:02:30,116
What has happened? What can l do?
My impatience keeps increasing.

967
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:37,232
There is magic in this crazy love.

968
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:43,762
Our bodies are crazy
and heart is not in control.

969
01:02:43,873 --> 01:02:49,436
Don't tease me. Just tell me,
how l shall satisfy this urge.

970
01:02:49,512 --> 01:02:53,346
My scarf got blown away my dear.

971
01:02:53,783 --> 01:02:59,585
The weather has teased me.
The wind has gone crazy.

972
01:02:59,722 --> 01:03:02,850
My scarf got blown away my dear.

973
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:06,219
lt has exposed your body.

974
01:03:06,296 --> 01:03:09,732
My scarf got blown away my dear.

975
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:13,394
lt has exposed your body.

976
01:03:17,907 --> 01:03:20,842
Great Yograj!
What a move you have made!

977
01:03:21,277 --> 01:03:25,611
l thought that in politics
even God cannot beat politicians.

978
01:03:25,782 --> 01:03:29,513
But you have gone even ahead
of politicians. What a move!

979
01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:35,347
l have made my move. But now
all the cards are in your hands.

980
01:03:35,658 --> 01:03:38,149
lf you wish on Laxmidas' estate.

981
01:03:38,228 --> 01:03:40,253
Yograj community
can be made easily.

982
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:43,595
What can be made Yograj?
Think that it is made. Why Chandru?

983
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:46,499
You are out of your senses,
Deshmukh!

984
01:03:46,569 --> 01:03:49,163
ls that an open ground of cricket..

985
01:03:49,672 --> 01:03:51,663
..that you will go
there and make a building?

986
01:03:52,342 --> 01:03:59,510
l don't know how you became
the Minister of this state.

987
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,150
How can you remove people..

988
01:04:02,218 --> 01:04:03,515
..who have been living
there for forty years?

989
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:05,645
What could not be
done in forty years..

990
01:04:05,722 --> 01:04:07,485
..will be done in 40 minutes.

991
01:04:07,557 --> 01:04:08,785
Al least you all don't fight.

992
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:10,883
No, Mr. Chatur, no! Not now please.

993
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:12,856
Election is on the head now.

994
01:04:13,263 --> 01:04:14,662
And that area is my vote bank.

995
01:04:15,198 --> 01:04:17,496
Whatever you want to do,
do it after the elections, please!

996
01:04:17,567 --> 01:04:19,831
This will not do. This will not do.

997
01:04:20,336 --> 01:04:22,861
Such problems keep
happening during elections.

998
01:04:23,473 --> 01:04:26,772
Work will be done, brother.
You didn't understand?

999
01:04:27,243 --> 01:04:30,337
You defame me and l'll defame you.

1000
01:04:31,314 --> 01:04:34,715
From years patriotic people
like us have been doing this.

1001
01:04:34,918 --> 01:04:37,386
l will create riots.

1002
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:42,123
Nobody can beat me in the
whole of lndia in creating riots.

1003
01:04:42,192 --> 01:04:44,752
Enough of praising. Now
let's discuss what we have to do.

1004
01:04:44,827 --> 01:04:48,627
After a couple of meetings
for election, a big explosion!

1005
01:04:48,765 --> 01:04:51,165
Brothers and sisters!

1006
01:04:51,568 --> 01:04:55,595
After independence,
so many elections came and went.

1007
01:04:56,172 --> 01:04:59,630
Politicians came and
gave many speeches and went.

1008
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:05,079
But this time we have brought the..

1009
01:05:05,148 --> 01:05:07,378
..leaders of opposition
parties in front of you.

1010
01:05:08,151 --> 01:05:11,848
This is the leader
of Janta Jagriti Party.

1011
01:05:12,622 --> 01:05:14,419
Mr. Babanrao Deshmukh.

1012
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:21,227
And his sign is drowning ship.

1013
01:05:21,464 --> 01:05:23,694
That is why he has come to save..

1014
01:05:23,766 --> 01:05:25,859
..the drowning ship of our country.

1015
01:05:26,169 --> 01:05:27,693
Clap your hands!

1016
01:05:29,339 --> 01:05:30,806
Listen, listen.

1017
01:05:31,608 --> 01:05:34,907
This is the revolutionary
leader of Krantikari Party.

1018
01:05:35,211 --> 01:05:37,179
Shri Chandrasen Azad.

1019
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:41,349
His sign is burnt bread.

1020
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:45,717
He promises to feed
all the poor of the country.

1021
01:05:45,788 --> 01:05:48,313
And will eat himself.

1022
01:05:48,391 --> 01:05:50,359
Clap your hands!

1023
01:05:52,362 --> 01:05:54,387
Friends, brothers and sisters.

1024
01:05:55,131 --> 01:05:56,758
Friends, brothers and sisters.

1025
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:01,534
From last so many years
you all have elected us.

1026
01:06:02,438 --> 01:06:04,372
And we have also kept winning.

1027
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:10,771
You all know very well for
that what all we have given you.

1028
01:06:10,847 --> 01:06:14,442
He is telling lies.
He is telling all lies.

1029
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:18,414
They are talking
like a taped cassette.

1030
01:06:19,622 --> 01:06:22,318
But you all should
not believe in their talk.

1031
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:25,519
lf these people have
given you anything.

1032
01:06:26,095 --> 01:06:28,723
Then it is poverty, unemployment..

1033
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:31,562
..hunger, corruption!

1034
01:06:33,569 --> 01:06:36,732
This will not work.
This government will not work.

1035
01:06:36,806 --> 01:06:41,675
My blood is boiling listening
to this Kranti Party's dual talk.

1036
01:06:42,478 --> 01:06:47,211
Mr. Chandrasen Azad l am
asking you just one question.

1037
01:06:47,784 --> 01:06:53,347
To obtain seat and power
what all tricks you have not used.

1038
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:55,624
Religion, caste and God knows..

1039
01:06:55,692 --> 01:06:59,287
..what else problems
you create and fool people.

1040
01:06:59,662 --> 01:07:02,358
But now. - We are not
going to be fools any longer.

1041
01:07:02,432 --> 01:07:04,730
Neither by you, nor by them.

1042
01:07:04,801 --> 01:07:06,666
Can we have an applause!

1043
01:07:10,373 --> 01:07:14,469
This will not work.
Mr. Deshmukh. This won't work.

1044
01:07:15,645 --> 01:07:24,349
Just once give the reins of
the country in our hands and see.

1045
01:07:25,588 --> 01:07:29,080
And then give us the
chance to serve the country.

1046
01:07:29,158 --> 01:07:35,188
Serving the country
he will make so much profit.

1047
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:37,824
That the whole country
will be ruined.

1048
01:08:28,418 --> 01:08:30,716
Pratap! - Yes.
- See, the community is in flames!

1049
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:34,846
Pratap! - What happened?

1050
01:08:35,124 --> 01:08:37,319
Mr. Laxmidas,
they have killed my wife!

1051
01:08:37,727 --> 01:08:39,524
Who!? - See they are all agitated.

1052
01:08:39,595 --> 01:08:41,825
Hindus and Muslims
are killing each other.

1053
01:08:42,098 --> 01:08:44,225
Help me soon, Mr. Laxmidas!

1054
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,892
Come inside. - Atul, come.

1055
01:09:10,426 --> 01:09:11,791
What is this happening?

1056
01:09:12,462 --> 01:09:13,724
l can't understand anything.
- l am going..

1057
01:09:13,796 --> 01:09:15,093
..to call the fire brigade.

1058
01:09:27,643 --> 01:09:29,611
Catch him!

1059
01:09:31,781 --> 01:09:34,579
Hello? l am speaking
from Laxmi community. - Yes?

1060
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:36,675
Please come soon. There
is a fire all round over here.

1061
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:40,280
Yes, l know. There is fire
all round and many have died.

1062
01:09:40,356 --> 01:09:41,380
But when will you come!?

1063
01:09:41,457 --> 01:09:42,651
When the tankers come,
we will come.

1064
01:09:42,725 --> 01:09:45,660
By then everything will
turn to ashes. Come soon please!

1065
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:48,720
Sir, there are also riots
happening in Laxmi community.

1066
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:50,265
We have a message on the
wireless from headquarters.

1067
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:51,493
We must reach there soon.

1068
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:53,432
To hell with the message
from headquarters!

1069
01:09:53,636 --> 01:09:56,901
Let a few thousands die.
Let the whole community burn.

1070
01:09:57,173 --> 01:10:00,108
Then we will go. Go. And listen.

1071
01:10:00,176 --> 01:10:01,666
Switch off the wireless machine.

1072
01:10:01,844 --> 01:10:05,439
lf anybody asks you, say that
the machine was not working. Go.

1073
01:10:06,749 --> 01:10:09,877
Our gain is in letting
the Laxmi community burn.

1074
01:10:10,853 --> 01:10:13,822
Pratap! Pratap!
- Oh, my child is getting burnt.

1075
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:16,825
Please do anything
to save my child. My child!

1076
01:10:16,893 --> 01:10:19,225
My child!

1077
01:10:20,763 --> 01:10:23,493
My child!

1078
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:43,418
Atul, take this one to
the hospital soon. Take him.

1079
01:10:43,486 --> 01:10:44,919
Move, move.

1080
01:10:45,187 --> 01:10:47,747
Chhotu, get up son. Get up.

1081
01:10:48,157 --> 01:10:50,625
Sister Kamli!
Come out, there is a fire.

1082
01:10:51,894 --> 01:10:55,830
Sister Kamli!
Come out. Come soon, sister.

1083
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:58,657
Sister Kamli, come out soon.

1084
01:11:05,508 --> 01:11:13,279
Chhotu! Chhotu!
What has happened to my.. Chhotu!

1085
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:18,680
Pratap-bhai, please save my Chhotu.

1086
01:11:18,754 --> 01:11:20,449
What has happened to my Chhotu?

1087
01:11:20,523 --> 01:11:27,861
l cannot live without him.
Save him, save my Chhotu.

1088
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:29,859
What has happened?

1089
01:11:40,242 --> 01:11:43,177
He is to pester you to
tell him stories, right?..

1090
01:11:43,846 --> 01:11:45,575
..Now tell him a story.

1091
01:11:45,648 --> 01:11:49,812
Maybe he will get up.
Please tell him.

1092
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:55,381
What did my son do to anyone?
They burnt him.

1093
01:11:56,425 --> 01:11:59,155
l have lost everything of mine.

1094
01:11:59,629 --> 01:12:02,189
What has happened to my child?

1095
01:12:02,798 --> 01:12:06,757
Why is he not saying anything?

1096
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:11,298
Why is he not saying anything?

1097
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:54,713
My child!

1098
01:13:37,226 --> 01:13:39,456
Today there is so much
light in our place, right Pratap?

1099
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:47,625
What business is this, Pratap?

1100
01:13:48,704 --> 01:13:53,437
Who has killed whom,
burnt whom, nobody knows.

1101
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:00,804
This body's mother, that body's..

1102
01:14:03,552 --> 01:14:08,854
..wife must be crying somewhere.

1103
01:14:12,895 --> 01:14:14,795
That body's children
may have become orphans today.

1104
01:14:20,402 --> 01:14:22,165
Many of them might have
slept with starvation tonight.

1105
01:14:25,641 --> 01:14:29,702
And the people who have turned..

1106
01:14:31,547 --> 01:14:32,878
..this place into a
grave-yard must be rejoicing.

1107
01:14:39,622 --> 01:14:41,852
Pratap, there is not enough place..

1108
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:45,256
..to burn or bury
at the grave-yard.

1109
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:55,295
Queue! There is a queue!

1110
01:14:55,905 --> 01:14:58,430
Queue! Queue!

1111
01:14:58,507 --> 01:15:00,532
When we are alive,
there is a queue for ration.

1112
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:03,234
After dying, a queue for burning.

1113
01:15:03,512 --> 01:15:05,878
Tomorrow, the government
will decide on their price.

1114
01:15:06,148 --> 01:15:09,117
Half burnt, 50,000.
Full burnt, 1 lakhs.

1115
01:15:09,251 --> 01:15:12,652
Slashed hand 15,000.
House burnt.. 25,000.

1116
01:15:16,725 --> 01:15:20,286
Why are you not laughing?
Laugh. Laugh loudly.

1117
01:15:20,362 --> 01:15:21,829
You have the habit
of laughing, right?

1118
01:15:22,398 --> 01:15:24,491
This matter doesn't end here,
Pratap.

1119
01:15:24,567 --> 01:15:26,467
Today it has happened here.
Tomorrow it will happen there.

1120
01:15:26,535 --> 01:15:28,696
And then some place else.

1121
01:15:29,305 --> 01:15:32,297
You were saying that
these people are sleeping.

1122
01:15:32,374 --> 01:15:34,239
These people were sleeping,
don't awaken them.

1123
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:35,675
Don't awaken them.
They are sleeping, Pratap.

1124
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:38,542
Now no one can awaken them.
Neither you nor me.

1125
01:15:38,781 --> 01:15:42,512
Their body is dead.
But your soul is dead.

1126
01:15:42,585 --> 01:15:44,917
What will you awaken your soul?

1127
01:15:45,187 --> 01:15:47,883
How come are you going to bring the
light of revolution in yourself?

1128
01:15:48,157 --> 01:15:50,387
What are you going
to bring from the one..

1129
01:15:50,459 --> 01:15:52,825
..who had played
this game of death!

1130
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:56,663
Laugh, Pratap. Laugh, Pratap.

1131
01:15:56,732 --> 01:15:59,929
l am eager to hear your laugh.
Laugh, laugh.

1132
01:16:00,135 --> 01:16:05,573
Laugh loudly.
Laugh. l am laughing for you.

1133
01:16:11,447 --> 01:16:13,711
Pratap will bring
about a revolution!?

1134
01:17:10,339 --> 01:17:14,139
Tell the truth.
Who are you? Hindu or Muslim?

1135
01:17:23,886 --> 01:17:31,691
lf you are a Hindu then
think l am a Muslim and kill me.

1136
01:17:33,762 --> 01:17:39,496
And if you are a Muslim then..

1137
01:17:42,438 --> 01:17:44,599
..think l am a Hindu and kill me.

1138
01:18:08,397 --> 01:18:12,197
Cheers! Sit, sit.

1139
01:18:17,239 --> 01:18:20,766
Did you see Mr. Deshmukh?
This is what you call politics.

1140
01:18:21,343 --> 01:18:23,106
There was a fire in one community.

1141
01:18:23,145 --> 01:18:24,669
And the whole city is burning.

1142
01:18:25,681 --> 01:18:27,706
Agreed, Chatur, agreed!

1143
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:30,218
That is why leaders like us,
together with..

1144
01:18:30,452 --> 01:18:34,616
..underworld mafia like
you are ahead in politics.

1145
01:18:36,492 --> 01:18:38,653
But Mr. Deshmukh, why do you..

1146
01:18:38,694 --> 01:18:40,662
..forget faithful people
in uniform like us?

1147
01:18:40,896 --> 01:18:43,729
How can we forget people like you?

1148
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:46,464
That is why in all our work.

1149
01:18:46,502 --> 01:18:49,369
We keep a share for
faithful people like you.

1150
01:18:49,538 --> 01:18:51,335
Right, Mr. Yograj?

1151
01:18:51,373 --> 01:18:54,831
Now when Yograj community
will be built on Laxmi community.

1152
01:18:55,344 --> 01:18:58,643
We will all become millionaires.

1153
01:18:58,714 --> 01:19:02,150
Yograj, don't think we will become.
Think that we already are.

1154
01:19:03,419 --> 01:19:06,286
Listen! Take all this. All this.

1155
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:08,289
lf they had cut me up.

1156
01:19:08,323 --> 01:19:10,120
Of what use would all this be?

1157
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:17,531
They have burnt small children,
cut women.

1158
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,533
l have spent 40 years
of my life with them.

1159
01:19:21,804 --> 01:19:23,635
They have grown up in front of me.

1160
01:19:23,705 --> 01:19:28,199
l can't bear to see their
suffering. You take all this.

1161
01:19:28,277 --> 01:19:32,737
Build the whole community
with this money.

1162
01:19:37,519 --> 01:19:40,454
Why are you looking at me?
Why are you looking?

1163
01:19:40,823 --> 01:19:44,623
Take all this. Take all this.

1164
01:19:49,832 --> 01:19:55,771
Do you know? ln this city,
everyone had come with a dream.

1165
01:19:58,173 --> 01:20:00,164
l had given them a shelter.

1166
01:20:01,577 --> 01:20:05,570
l had not asked them whether
you are a Hindu or Muslim.

1167
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:10,848
Who are the cruel people
who have put the fire?

1168
01:20:12,221 --> 01:20:14,382
Humanity has burnt
and turned to ashes.

1169
01:20:18,327 --> 01:20:21,763
Dhaniya,
my father died in childhood.

1170
01:20:22,764 --> 01:20:24,493
Maybe that is why l
did not understand the..

1171
01:20:24,533 --> 01:20:25,898
..relationship of a father and son.

1172
01:20:26,535 --> 01:20:30,301
Today that has also been fulfilled.

1173
01:20:31,306 --> 01:20:34,139
Dhaniya, you are my father.

1174
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:40,647
You called me a father, right?

1175
01:20:41,683 --> 01:20:44,618
Then as an older son promise me.

1176
01:20:45,154 --> 01:20:48,817
Wherever l die you
must light my pyre.

1177
01:20:48,891 --> 01:20:50,358
Shut up.

1178
01:21:20,622 --> 01:21:22,487
Why none of you
are saying anything?

1179
01:21:22,758 --> 01:21:24,316
Am l saying something wrong?

1180
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,489
Don't you people believe in me?

1181
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:30,558
l have been living in this
community from so many years.

1182
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:32,666
l have seen fights
in this community.

1183
01:21:32,868 --> 01:21:34,426
l have seen mother-in-law
and daughter-in-law fighting.

1184
01:21:34,503 --> 01:21:35,936
l have seen Brothers fighting.

1185
01:21:36,338 --> 01:21:39,239
ln children's matters l
have seen you elders fighting.

1186
01:21:39,474 --> 01:21:41,635
But l have never seen anyone
fighting in the name of religion.

1187
01:21:42,544 --> 01:21:44,444
So today this Hindu and Muslim.

1188
01:21:44,746 --> 01:21:46,714
From where has these
Hindus and Muslims come?

1189
01:21:50,452 --> 01:21:51,851
Why don't you all understand?

1190
01:21:52,421 --> 01:21:54,412
The people who have
burnt our community..

1191
01:21:54,489 --> 01:21:55,854
..were neither Hindus nor Muslims.

1192
01:21:57,793 --> 01:22:01,160
They were goons bought
by a few traitor politicians.

1193
01:22:02,331 --> 01:22:03,821
Every politician wants this.

1194
01:22:03,899 --> 01:22:06,527
That we hate each other
in the name of religion.

1195
01:22:06,602 --> 01:22:08,661
That we kill each
other and shed blood.

1196
01:22:08,737 --> 01:22:11,331
And they will sit
and watch the fun.

1197
01:22:12,341 --> 01:22:14,138
We will not allow this to happen.

1198
01:22:17,546 --> 01:22:20,276
Stop this lecture of yours.
You want to know the truth.

1199
01:22:20,349 --> 01:22:24,809
Come with me. Come here.

1200
01:22:24,886 --> 01:22:26,444
These are my innocent children.

1201
01:22:26,521 --> 01:22:29,456
Ask them who has killed my wife.

1202
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:32,821
Ask them who killed their mother.

1203
01:22:32,894 --> 01:22:35,761
Ask him. Who has killed
your mother, child?

1204
01:22:35,797 --> 01:22:37,822
A Hindu has killed.

1205
01:22:37,899 --> 01:22:39,526
Did you hear that?

1206
01:22:48,377 --> 01:22:49,708
Tell me one thing.

1207
01:22:49,778 --> 01:22:52,542
Who has taught these innocent
children about Hindus and Muslim?

1208
01:22:52,814 --> 01:22:55,339
You, who can't even say their name!

1209
01:22:55,384 --> 01:22:56,612
And you have taught them about..

1210
01:22:56,652 --> 01:22:58,142
..their mother's murderer
and about religion?

1211
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:02,117
See, lsmail. ln the minds
of these innocent children..

1212
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:04,385
..you are feeding
hatred from childhood.

1213
01:23:04,426 --> 01:23:07,486
Come here!
Who is this?

1214
01:23:07,696 --> 01:23:09,459
Kalyan-ji.
- Kalyanji-bhai is a Hindu.

1215
01:23:09,531 --> 01:23:12,432
Who is this? - Ganga-bhabhi.

1216
01:23:12,467 --> 01:23:14,731
Ganga-bhabhi. Who is looking
after your kids? - Ganga-bhabhi.

1217
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:16,795
Ganga-bhabhi. She is a Hindu,
then why didn't they cut her.

1218
01:23:17,673 --> 01:23:20,141
Come here.
l will show you the truth.

1219
01:23:30,285 --> 01:23:33,448
Here. This is Muslim's
blood and this is Hindu's blood.

1220
01:23:33,655 --> 01:23:37,614
Tell me which is Muslim's
blood and Hindu's blood in this.

1221
01:23:38,193 --> 01:23:40,320
Tell me!
When the one who has made you..

1222
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:42,260
..has not made any difference,
then who are you to do that?

1223
01:23:42,331 --> 01:23:44,424
This journalist madam
is telling the truth.

1224
01:23:44,499 --> 01:23:46,763
Her bitter truth doesn't
go into your brains.

1225
01:23:46,835 --> 01:23:49,531
Who has killed whom?
Who has burnt whom?

1226
01:23:49,604 --> 01:23:51,731
Till yesterday we were taking
part in each other's festivals.

1227
01:23:51,807 --> 01:23:53,399
Sharing each other's
joys and sorrows.

1228
01:23:53,475 --> 01:23:57,241
Why were you taking Ganesha
and going in the water?

1229
01:23:57,379 --> 01:24:00,678
Hail Lord Ganesha!
Why were you dancing?

1230
01:24:07,556 --> 01:24:09,615
Who taught this to you?

1231
01:24:09,725 --> 01:24:12,216
Now you want to
bury your brethren..

1232
01:24:12,294 --> 01:24:13,852
..in the plot of a few traitors!

1233
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:18,630
Pratap, forgive me.
l had gone wrong. l had gone wrong.

1234
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:21,601
Pratap, forgive me.

1235
01:24:34,383 --> 01:24:39,184
Here they come
to offer condolences.

1236
01:24:39,454 --> 01:24:41,513
Along with the television people,
the press.

1237
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:43,421
So that in tomorrow's newspapers..

1238
01:24:43,492 --> 01:24:46,586
..their photos appear
on the front page.

1239
01:24:48,597 --> 01:24:51,259
They donate two drops of blood.

1240
01:24:51,333 --> 01:24:52,823
And make such a noise
about it in the newspaper.

1241
01:24:52,901 --> 01:24:55,495
Like they have shed
their blood for the poor.

1242
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:57,504
These rascals will sell
their own daughter and sister..

1243
01:24:57,572 --> 01:24:59,335
..for the sake of obtaining power.

1244
01:24:59,841 --> 01:25:01,274
Nothing everything is alright.

1245
01:25:03,111 --> 01:25:04,806
Don't take another step,
otherwise..

1246
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,643
..l'll break your leg
and hang it round your neck.

1247
01:25:07,149 --> 01:25:09,276
Today you have tried
to kill Ram and Allah.

1248
01:25:09,351 --> 01:25:10,784
But remember one thing.

1249
01:25:10,852 --> 01:25:13,377
We may call God by different names.

1250
01:25:13,455 --> 01:25:17,186
But our religion is one.
Our caste is one. Humanity.

1251
01:25:17,292 --> 01:25:19,760
Cunning people like you cannot..

1252
01:25:19,828 --> 01:25:22,126
..poison our minds
in the name of religion.

1253
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:26,464
What are you talking?
We have come to help the poor.

1254
01:25:26,535 --> 01:25:28,127
See brothers and sisters.

1255
01:25:28,203 --> 01:25:30,899
There is sympathy
in our hearts for you.

1256
01:25:31,139 --> 01:25:32,504
That is why we have come here.

1257
01:25:32,607 --> 01:25:34,370
We don't want your sympathy!

1258
01:25:34,443 --> 01:25:38,174
Yes, we don't want your sympathy!

1259
01:25:38,246 --> 01:25:41,613
What!? You are turning
the poor against us?

1260
01:25:41,716 --> 01:25:44,310
This will not do. This will not do.

1261
01:25:44,386 --> 01:25:45,751
You rascal!

1262
01:25:46,855 --> 01:25:52,225
Public is going crazy.
Let's run from here.

1263
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:04,395
Sir, in this file all
the reports are there.

1264
01:26:04,473 --> 01:26:08,239
By which you will know
who was behind these riots.

1265
01:26:08,577 --> 01:26:10,340
And the astounding
thing is this, sir.

1266
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:13,448
That in this,
a few of our police officers..

1267
01:26:13,515 --> 01:26:14,709
..who are traitors and
politicians are together.

1268
01:26:14,783 --> 01:26:17,183
This is why even the
law's hands are tied.

1269
01:26:17,452 --> 01:26:20,080
Sir, if Commissioner
is strict then..

1270
01:26:20,255 --> 01:26:21,654
..there is pressure from above.

1271
01:26:21,723 --> 01:26:25,625
You forget the pressure
from above Commissioner.

1272
01:26:25,827 --> 01:26:29,228
Above all is our administration,
our law.

1273
01:26:29,264 --> 01:26:30,731
Above all is our administration,
our law.

1274
01:26:31,132 --> 01:26:33,657
No prime minister,
nor a politician..

1275
01:26:34,169 --> 01:26:38,265
..nor an officer nor
a citizen is above the law.

1276
01:26:38,306 --> 01:26:42,572
But, sir..
- l know that nowadays in politics.

1277
01:26:42,744 --> 01:26:44,871
ln the place of good leaders,
certain..

1278
01:26:45,146 --> 01:26:46,579
..unsocial elements
have also got in.

1279
01:26:46,815 --> 01:26:50,273
Because of whom today politics..

1280
01:26:50,352 --> 01:26:52,479
..and other good leaders'
names also get spoilt.

1281
01:26:52,854 --> 01:26:55,550
But l am giving you full right to..

1282
01:26:55,624 --> 01:26:58,787
..remove lawlessness
from administration.

1283
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:01,624
lf you face any obstacle
or problem in that..

1284
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:04,594
..then you can meet
the Home Minister for that.

1285
01:27:04,799 --> 01:27:06,289
Thank you, sir.

1286
01:27:07,168 --> 01:27:09,796
The matter has reached Delhi
Mr. Chatur Singh.

1287
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:13,063
And from Delhi to my
city and then to my house.

1288
01:27:13,141 --> 01:27:15,302
We will cut the
tongue of the person..

1289
01:27:15,544 --> 01:27:17,739
..who has taken
the matter to Delhi.

1290
01:27:17,812 --> 01:27:21,509
Just tell me,
who had gone to Delhi?

1291
01:27:21,816 --> 01:27:24,876
One of our Commissioners
had gone with them.

1292
01:27:25,153 --> 01:27:27,348
But. - What but? Talk clearly.

1293
01:27:27,622 --> 01:27:30,785
All this is the work
of that Megha Dixit. - Yes.

1294
01:27:31,159 --> 01:27:33,150
Who has been writing continuously
in the newspapers.

1295
01:27:33,228 --> 01:27:35,128
And making a big fire out of this..

1296
01:27:35,196 --> 01:27:36,891
..which will engulf me tomorrow.

1297
01:27:37,165 --> 01:27:41,534
And that beggar.
What is his name? - Pratap

1298
01:27:41,703 --> 01:27:43,466
Pratap should be killed.

1299
01:27:43,605 --> 01:27:46,301
lf Pratap is killed,
we will be saved.

1300
01:27:46,374 --> 01:27:48,308
And he will burn
in the fire and die.

1301
01:27:48,443 --> 01:27:51,674
And l am telling you the
support of Pratap is Megha Dixit.

1302
01:27:51,746 --> 01:27:54,408
lf Megha Dixit is killed.
- Stop this nonsense.

1303
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:56,847
You all have broken my ear drum.

1304
01:27:57,886 --> 01:27:59,786
Everybody is giving speeches.

1305
01:28:01,156 --> 01:28:04,182
Don't you know Chatur
Singh doesn't like loud noise?

1306
01:28:05,527 --> 01:28:10,089
Ankush, find out
about this Dixit girl.

1307
01:28:11,299 --> 01:28:15,565
Let me also see
who has reached Delhi.

1308
01:28:15,837 --> 01:28:17,395
What she is.

1309
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:27,512
Enough of your drama.
Stop writing and listen to me.

1310
01:28:48,536 --> 01:28:50,902
Oh! So it is you.

1311
01:28:51,473 --> 01:28:55,705
We thought that after so much
happening you will die of shame.

1312
01:28:56,144 --> 01:28:57,736
You are. - You rascal!

1313
01:28:57,812 --> 01:28:59,712
lf you talk too much
then l will cut your tongue.

1314
01:29:06,121 --> 01:29:07,713
You will cut my tongue?

1315
01:29:27,308 --> 01:29:31,108
Pratap, Pratap, leave them.
They are very dangerous people.

1316
01:29:34,649 --> 01:29:36,241
Pratap, leave them.

1317
01:29:57,138 --> 01:29:58,730
Please make him understand.

1318
01:29:58,807 --> 01:30:01,332
Pratap, leave them.
Leave them, Pratap.

1319
01:30:16,925 --> 01:30:18,187
Pratap.

1320
01:30:40,782 --> 01:30:45,344
Leave me, leave me, leave me!

1321
01:30:46,755 --> 01:30:50,191
Leave me!
- Who are you? - Leave me!

1322
01:30:50,391 --> 01:30:53,383
A cheap goon calls
you a whore! Who are you!

1323
01:30:53,595 --> 01:30:57,395
What is your true identity!
Who are you! Who are you!

1324
01:30:57,599 --> 01:31:01,501
'Holi'! 'Holi'! 'Holi'!

1325
01:31:04,672 --> 01:31:05,832
The 'Holi' of blood!

1326
01:31:56,224 --> 01:31:59,887
Jingle. Jingle. Jingle.

1327
01:31:59,961 --> 01:32:04,261
l love yourjingling sound.

1328
01:32:04,332 --> 01:32:07,824

l love yourjingling sound.

1330
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:16,370
Fair lady. Beautiful lady,
sways in such a way.

1331
01:32:16,444 --> 01:32:20,710
A lightening strikes
my mind and body.

1332
01:32:20,782 --> 01:32:23,945
Don't spray.
Don't spray. Don't spray.

1333
01:32:24,018 --> 01:32:28,785
Don't spray colors on me this way.

1334
01:32:28,823 --> 01:32:32,281
Don't spray. Don't spray.
Don't spray.

1335
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:36,797
Don't spray colors on me this way.

1336
01:32:36,864 --> 01:32:41,130
My blouse gets wet, my sari
gets wet and so does my skirt.

1337
01:32:41,169 --> 01:32:45,128
How will l show it off?
My skirt is very expensive.

1338
01:32:45,206 --> 01:32:48,801
Jingle. Jingle. Jingle.

01:32:48,876 --> 01:32:53,142

1340
01:33:18,006 --> 01:33:22,067
The anklets sweetly

01:33:22,143 --> 01:33:26,204
lt sounds like a song
sung by cuckoo.

1342
01:33:30,218 --> 01:33:34,154
The anklets sweetly
jingle on your ankles.

1343
01:33:34,222 --> 01:33:37,885
lt sounds like
a song sung by cuckoo.

1344
01:33:37,959 --> 01:33:41,725
Lovely. Lovely my queen.

1345
01:33:41,796 --> 01:33:46,233
Your body looks lovely.

1346
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:49,827
Lovely. Lovely my queen.

Your body looks lovely.

1348
01:33:54,475 --> 01:33:58,707
My blouse gets wet, my sari
gets wet and so does my skirt.

1349
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:02,807
How will l show it off?
My skirt is very expensive.

1350
01:34:02,884 --> 01:34:06,012
Don't spray.
Don't spray. Don't spray.

1351
01:34:06,087 --> 01:34:10,751
Don't spray colors on me this way.

1352
01:34:39,153 --> 01:34:43,146
During this season
everything seems pleasant.

1353
01:34:43,224 --> 01:34:47,854
Even the aged have become young,
such a season has come.

1354
01:34:47,895 --> 01:34:51,956
Don't tease me this way, Casanova.

1355
01:34:52,033 --> 01:34:55,969
Why do you wet my fair body?

1356
01:35:00,041 --> 01:35:03,943
Don't tease me this way, Casanova.

1357
01:35:04,011 --> 01:35:07,913
Why do you wet my fair body?

1358
01:35:07,982 --> 01:35:11,281
Your charm. Your charm your charm.

1359
01:35:11,352 --> 01:35:15,789
Your charm creates a magic.

1360
01:35:15,857 --> 01:35:19,452
Your charm. Your charm your charm.

1361
01:35:19,727 --> 01:35:24,130
Your charm creates a magic.

1362
01:35:24,198 --> 01:35:28,157
The fair lady, beautiful lady
sways in such a way.

1363
01:35:28,236 --> 01:35:32,434
A lightening strikes
my mind and body.

1364
01:35:32,707 --> 01:35:36,302
Jingle. Jingle. Jingle.

1365
01:35:37,378 --> 01:35:39,005
Leave me! Leave me!

1366
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:42,277
What's going on?

1367
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:46,787
Leave her! Rascal!
Leave her! l say, leave her.

1368
01:35:46,854 --> 01:35:47,980
Move aside. Leave her.

1369
01:35:48,055 --> 01:35:50,148
Leave her! l said leave her!

1370
01:35:50,858 --> 01:35:52,883
You both take away the girl!
l'll handle him!

1371
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,257
Come! - He'll kill him.

1372
01:36:01,435 --> 01:36:04,029
Will no one stop him?

1373
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:13,974
Rascal!

1374
01:36:15,082 --> 01:36:17,346
Beware if you touched my daughter!

1375
01:36:17,718 --> 01:36:19,811
Leave my daughter alone! - Mother!

1376
01:36:24,692 --> 01:36:27,286
The power of pen gives you a high,
doesn't it!

1377
01:36:28,229 --> 01:36:30,322
You write anything
in your newspaper!

1378
01:36:31,065 --> 01:36:33,693
l'll write! l'll surely write!

1379
01:36:34,235 --> 01:36:38,934
lf l am alive, then l'll surely
write against traitors like you!

1380
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:41,301
Yes! Write! Surely write!

1381
01:36:41,709 --> 01:36:44,303
Write about this show
in tomorrow's newspaper!

1382
01:36:44,845 --> 01:36:51,080
Today in front of your eyes,
l'll rape your daughter!

1383
01:36:59,227 --> 01:37:04,995
Leave me alone!
- Rascal - Leave her!

1384
01:37:05,066 --> 01:37:06,863
Mother!

1385
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:36,789
You can show the
result of your mistake!

1386
01:37:36,864 --> 01:37:40,322
l'll show you the result! Rascal!

1387
01:37:41,302 --> 01:37:44,237
Now l'll make your life hell!

1388
01:38:27,815 --> 01:38:29,874
Judge, maybe you remember.

1389
01:38:30,217 --> 01:38:34,984
3 years ago, you'd given
this gold medal to first class..

1390
01:38:35,056 --> 01:38:38,082
..first student Megha Dixit of M.K.
Gandhi Law college.

1391
01:38:38,225 --> 01:38:41,786
Today that gold medalist
wants to tell you that..

1392
01:38:41,862 --> 01:38:45,389
..this man standing here
is a stigma on the society.

1393
01:38:45,433 --> 01:38:47,162
He is a rapist! He is a murderer!

1394
01:38:47,401 --> 01:38:52,930
He raped me! Before my eyes,
he killed my parents!

1395
01:38:53,007 --> 01:38:56,204
This man doesn't have the right
to live in our society, Your Honor!

1396
01:38:56,277 --> 01:38:58,438
Objection, Your Honor!
- Please let me finish!

1397
01:38:58,679 --> 01:39:01,079
Mr. Mirchandani, let her speak.

1398
01:39:01,415 --> 01:39:03,781
l know what Mr. Mirchandani
is going to say.

1399
01:39:03,984 --> 01:39:06,248
Because even l'd studied law.

1400
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:09,118
And l know that what
is written in books..

1401
01:39:09,190 --> 01:39:11,249
..doesn't have practical
application in the court.

1402
01:39:12,126 --> 01:39:13,991
Now Mr. Mirchandani will demand..

1403
01:39:14,028 --> 01:39:15,256
..for witnesses and evidences!

1404
01:39:15,329 --> 01:39:18,093
After all this law and order is
based on its hollow foundation only!

1405
01:39:18,432 --> 01:39:21,230
He is amongst those
lawyers whose profession..

1406
01:39:21,302 --> 01:39:23,634
..is to convert truth
into lie and lie into truth.

1407
01:39:23,904 --> 01:39:25,735
He is not trustworthy.

1408
01:39:25,806 --> 01:39:28,104
He can even say that
on the day of the incident..

1409
01:39:28,175 --> 01:39:29,904
..Chatur Singh was
not in this country!

1410
01:39:29,977 --> 01:39:31,308
Exactly, Your Honor!

1411
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,974
Then what are you waiting for!

1412
01:39:33,047 --> 01:39:34,378
Give the judge those fake passport,
fake ticket..

1413
01:39:34,448 --> 01:39:37,815
..and fake hotel bills
where Chatur Singh was staying!

1414
01:39:37,885 --> 01:39:39,147
So that the decision can
be made as soon as possible!

1415
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:41,415
Those evidences are in this file,
Your Honor.

1416
01:39:41,789 --> 01:39:43,848
These are the evidences
that will prove him innocent.

1417
01:39:43,924 --> 01:39:46,085
Brilliant, Mr.
Mirchandani! Brilliant!

1418
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:55,029
Ms. Megha Dixit,
after all what do you want to say?

1419
01:39:55,102 --> 01:39:56,763
Judge, l just want
you to strangulate..

1420
01:39:57,104 --> 01:39:59,299
..these fake evidences.

1421
01:39:59,707 --> 01:40:01,299
And make the right
decision so that..

1422
01:40:01,442 --> 01:40:04,843
..rascals like Chatur Singh
are never born in the future.

1423
01:40:05,079 --> 01:40:08,981
So that he doesn't have the
courage to play with others' lives.

1424
01:40:09,049 --> 01:40:12,382
Your Honor, Ms. Megha Dixit
is a gold medalist in law.

1425
01:40:12,653 --> 01:40:14,883
She gives strong points.

1426
01:40:14,955 --> 01:40:17,185
But she forgot that
poignant arguments..

1427
01:40:17,258 --> 01:40:19,249
..are not taken into
consideration in the court.

1428
01:40:19,693 --> 01:40:24,357
By fighting cases for traitors
who sells the country, smugglers..

1429
01:40:24,432 --> 01:40:27,663
..criminals, you've sold
yourself for the sake of money.

1430
01:40:28,235 --> 01:40:30,260
Do lawyers like you.. do lawyers..

1431
01:40:30,337 --> 01:40:31,998
..like you have a heart,
Mr. Mirchandani?

1432
01:40:32,072 --> 01:40:34,336
Even whores are
much better than you.

1433
01:40:34,775 --> 01:40:37,175
They do sell.. but only their body.

1434
01:40:37,244 --> 01:40:40,179
They don't sell their country,
their conscience.

1435
01:40:40,247 --> 01:40:43,808
Few lawyers like you are
contempt for the court and law.

1436
01:40:43,984 --> 01:40:46,976
lf l had my way then l would
have snatched all your medals away!

1437
01:40:47,054 --> 01:40:49,079
Ms. Megha, control yourself!

1438
01:40:49,223 --> 01:40:52,852
Control! What do l control myself!

1439
01:40:52,927 --> 01:40:57,864
lf a woman, who has been raped,
has to implore forjustice..

1440
01:40:57,932 --> 01:41:00,765
..then such law and
judge should feel ashamed!

1441
01:41:00,835 --> 01:41:03,030
Ms. Megha,
this is contempt of the court!

1442
01:41:03,204 --> 01:41:05,365
Have you come to ask
forjustice or snatch it!

1443
01:41:05,439 --> 01:41:08,738
Judge, who said thatjustice,
is given when we ask for it!

1444
01:41:08,976 --> 01:41:12,036
Justice is not given
by asking or by snatching!

1445
01:41:12,112 --> 01:41:14,444
Today justice is only sold!

1446
01:41:14,715 --> 01:41:19,049
That's why rascals like
Chatur Singh lead a proud life!

1447
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:20,450
For them law is just
like a handkerchief..

1448
01:41:20,721 --> 01:41:21,779
..to be kept in the pocket!

1449
01:41:21,856 --> 01:41:24,120
Your Honor, Ms.
Megha Dixit is wasting..

1450
01:41:24,191 --> 01:41:26,352
..the court's time by
talking about useless things.

1451
01:41:26,427 --> 01:41:29,828
So l would like to request
the court to give the decision.

1452
01:41:29,997 --> 01:41:33,956
What decision will he make!
What decision will he make!

1453
01:41:35,002 --> 01:41:36,799
l give the decision!

1454
01:41:37,838 --> 01:41:41,467
On the basis of the
evidences and witnesses..

1455
01:41:42,977 --> 01:41:47,414
..the court has taken the
decision that Shri Chatur Singh..

1456
01:41:47,982 --> 01:41:51,110
..the social worker, is not guilty.

1457
01:41:52,119 --> 01:41:55,486
So he is acquitted!

1458
01:41:56,257 --> 01:41:58,452
lsn't this your decision, judge?

1459
01:42:02,296 --> 01:42:03,991
l was right.

1460
01:42:04,064 --> 01:42:07,795
Judge released Chatur
Singh on the basis..

1461
01:42:08,202 --> 01:42:10,102
..of fake evidences and witnesses.

1462
01:42:10,170 --> 01:42:13,003
And l, standing in the witness box,
could only look..

1463
01:42:13,073 --> 01:42:15,940
..at the crippled law
and order of our country.

1464
01:42:32,726 --> 01:42:34,387
Even you live alone
in this community.

1465
01:42:35,362 --> 01:42:36,761
Don't you have a kin?

1466
01:42:36,897 --> 01:42:39,263
Yes, l do. l have a mother..
l don't know about brothers.

1467
01:42:39,433 --> 01:42:40,991
And? - You.

1468
01:42:48,509 --> 01:42:49,999
l've never robbed anybody,
l don't depend..

1469
01:42:50,077 --> 01:42:51,339
..on anybody for my
livelihood and l don't drink.

1470
01:42:51,412 --> 01:42:52,743
l smoke cigarette.
My mouth reeks with tobacco.

1471
01:42:52,813 --> 01:42:53,871
So think about it.

1472
01:43:33,787 --> 01:43:35,778
Saw that? They all were killed.

1473
01:43:36,957 --> 01:43:40,723
They were going
to abduct Megha Dixit.

1474
01:43:40,995 --> 01:43:42,963
And they came here tied in sacks.

1475
01:43:44,064 --> 01:43:49,730
Vashiroa, think of a way
to teach that rascal a lesson..

1476
01:43:50,104 --> 01:43:53,870
..so as to frighten
the whole locality.

1477
01:43:54,241 --> 01:43:58,177
Mr. Laxmidas,
wipe the sweat of your brow.

1478
01:43:58,946 --> 01:44:01,915
And ponder over what l'm saying.

1479
01:44:03,450 --> 01:44:04,747
Understood!

1480
01:44:04,985 --> 01:44:06,043
l'll take your leave.

1481
01:44:32,146 --> 01:44:34,080
What's the matter, father?
Who was that man?

1482
01:44:35,249 --> 01:44:37,683
l've never seen him here before.

1483
01:44:37,985 --> 01:44:40,283
Why do you want to know
about all these things?

1484
01:44:40,854 --> 01:44:42,822
Can't a stranger come to meet me?

1485
01:44:42,890 --> 01:44:44,721
Yes, father. Why not.

1486
01:44:45,159 --> 01:44:47,457
But why are you covered
in sweat after meeting him?

1487
01:44:48,328 --> 01:44:49,852
Tell me the truth,
what's the matter?

1488
01:44:49,930 --> 01:44:52,990
Nothing. Nothing to worry about.

1489
01:44:53,867 --> 01:44:56,267
Your stammering reveals that
you're hiding something from me.

1490
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:57,994
Father, you have to tell the truth.

1491
01:44:58,072 --> 01:44:59,198
You are under the
oath of your only son.

1492
01:44:59,273 --> 01:45:04,210
Nothing. Who said that
l have only 1 son? l have 2 sons.

1493
01:45:04,278 --> 01:45:06,803
You are the youngest
and Pratap is the eldest son.

1494
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:09,144
Dhaniya, tell me the truth.
What's the matter?

1495
01:45:10,384 --> 01:45:12,818
Your 2 sons are alive.
Tell us, what's the matter?

1496
01:45:13,253 --> 01:45:18,213
No.. he is just.. nothing. Nothing.

1497
01:45:21,328 --> 01:45:27,324
Actually..
2 things make a person blind.

1498
01:45:28,402 --> 01:45:30,233
Property and wealth.

1499
01:45:31,371 --> 01:45:34,067
He fell in love with
Yograj's daughter.

1500
01:45:35,476 --> 01:45:40,675
And we 2 fathers did
a business deal out of it.

1501
01:45:40,881 --> 01:45:43,975
She is good girl. The girl is nice.

1502
01:45:45,185 --> 01:45:53,285
Yograj is a bigwig.
And l'm just an ordinary trader.

1503
01:45:54,995 --> 01:45:58,431
l'm trapped in his game.

1504
01:46:00,234 --> 01:46:05,331
Now in this game either
l'll lose my community or my life.

1505
01:46:05,405 --> 01:46:07,930
No, father. Till the time we're
alive nothing will happen to you.

1506
01:46:08,008 --> 01:46:09,066
Who are they? Give us their names.

1507
01:46:09,143 --> 01:46:12,806
Dear, you have no
inkling of their power.

1508
01:46:13,747 --> 01:46:16,011
The whole country
bows its head before him.

1509
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:18,741
lt is not in our limits.
- Forget that!

1510
01:46:18,819 --> 01:46:20,218
You first give me the
name and the whereabouts!

1511
01:46:20,287 --> 01:46:21,754
Yes, l will give it to you. - Look.
- l will give it to you later.

1512
01:46:21,789 --> 01:46:24,223
You first go and order for tea. Go.

1513
01:46:26,426 --> 01:46:29,691
Pratap.. l think father
is hiding the actual thing.

1514
01:46:30,364 --> 01:46:34,733
l can never believe this, Atul.
l know my father very well.

1515
01:46:35,102 --> 01:46:38,003
He can never do
this for my happiness.

1516
01:46:38,071 --> 01:46:40,335
And then,
we don't have any death of wealth.

1517
01:46:40,374 --> 01:46:43,207
Mamta, if you know your father..

1518
01:46:43,277 --> 01:46:45,245
..then even l know
my father very well.

1519
01:46:45,412 --> 01:46:50,042
He will never lie.
l'm afraid that our love..

1520
01:46:50,117 --> 01:46:52,915
Nothing will happen to our love,
Atul. Nothing.

1521
01:46:57,324 --> 01:46:58,882
And listen to one thing.

1522
01:46:59,927 --> 01:47:02,953
lf my father has made
a business of my love..

1523
01:47:03,230 --> 01:47:05,960
..then for the sake of my love,
l can abandon everything.

1524
01:47:06,033 --> 01:47:07,193
And everything..

1525
01:48:23,911 --> 01:48:26,937
You.. why did you call me?

1526
01:48:27,247 --> 01:48:31,980
Laxmidas.. there are
many people who snatch away..

1527
01:48:32,753 --> 01:48:35,779
..the thing for which
they develop a liking.

1528
01:48:36,423 --> 01:48:41,952
But l'm not like them.
l buy the thing that l like.

1529
01:48:43,063 --> 01:48:45,156
l like your Laxmi community.

1530
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,890
l want to build
a huge complex over..

1531
01:48:47,968 --> 01:48:49,367
..there in partnership with Yograj.

1532
01:48:50,737 --> 01:48:56,004
ln these suitcase..
is 3 crores cash.

1533
01:48:57,244 --> 01:49:00,145
And along with the agreement,
there is a cheque of 2 crores.

1534
01:49:01,415 --> 01:49:06,045
The price is right according
to the municipality valuation.

1535
01:49:07,821 --> 01:49:12,656
Now sign on the agreement.
Collect your money and enjoy.

1536
01:49:13,093 --> 01:49:14,993
But.. this..

1537
01:49:37,918 --> 01:49:40,409
You want to say something?

1538
01:51:24,825 --> 01:51:27,385
Stop! Nobody will touch the body!

1539
01:51:27,761 --> 01:51:30,958
This is a police case!
Yadhav, click the snaps!

1540
01:51:36,002 --> 01:51:38,436
l think he committed suicide.

1541
01:51:39,773 --> 01:51:42,708
Can't you see!
He has been killed and then hanged!

1542
01:51:42,776 --> 01:51:44,937
We can't reach to that conclusion.

1543
01:51:45,011 --> 01:51:46,945
Constable, lower the corpse.

1544
01:52:03,296 --> 01:52:06,163
lnspector, look.
ls there any mark on his neck?

1545
01:52:08,835 --> 01:52:11,201
When a person commits suicide,
there is a mark on his neck..

1546
01:52:11,271 --> 01:52:12,761
..and his tongue is pulled out!

1547
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:16,409
We can clearly see that he
has been killed and then hanged.

1548
01:52:16,676 --> 01:52:19,167
Ms. Megha, please.
Let us complete our investigations.

1549
01:52:19,246 --> 01:52:20,838
Yes, continue with
your investigation.

1550
01:52:20,881 --> 01:52:23,714
Order tea for lsmail.
Bring a chair for him.

1551
01:52:23,783 --> 01:52:25,375
Write, write whatever you want.

1552
01:52:25,952 --> 01:52:28,113
And then you can stack
it in some warehouse of..

1553
01:52:28,188 --> 01:52:29,815
..the police station to rot,
where countless cases are rotting.

1554
01:52:29,890 --> 01:52:31,221
Write, go ahead and write.

1555
01:52:31,825 --> 01:52:33,292
lt is futile to flare up.

1556
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:35,155
What had to happen, had happened.

1557
01:52:35,228 --> 01:52:37,389
Even l regret Laxmidas' death.

1558
01:52:37,464 --> 01:52:40,991
Don't remorse so much,
otherwise my Dhaniya will get up.

1559
01:52:42,102 --> 01:52:44,969
Mr. Pratap, please keep
your mouth shut and keep quiet!

1560
01:52:46,006 --> 01:52:47,371
What do you mean keep quiet!

1561
01:52:48,041 --> 01:52:49,440
What do you think about yourself!

1562
01:52:50,343 --> 01:52:52,140
Just by wearing this
uniform and the cap..

1563
01:52:52,212 --> 01:52:53,702
..you've become the
protector of law and order.

1564
01:52:53,947 --> 01:52:56,040
Assert law and order from here.

1565
01:52:56,116 --> 01:52:58,880
First erase the flowing
treachery from your blood.

1566
01:52:59,352 --> 01:53:01,115
You've come to investigate!

1567
01:53:01,188 --> 01:53:05,090
Court is yours, law is yours.
All of them are in this!

1568
01:53:05,725 --> 01:53:07,386
What will the culprit
write the report?

1569
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:09,428
We'll have to take the corpse to
the hospital for the post-mortem.

1570
01:53:09,696 --> 01:53:12,688
Constable!
- Hey! Hey! Constable, be careful.

1571
01:53:12,766 --> 01:53:13,926
Look, here is a small brain.

1572
01:53:13,967 --> 01:53:15,958
lf you hit that part
then a person can die..

1573
01:53:53,206 --> 01:53:54,696
Come ahead to light the pyre.

1574
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:09,880
'As my eldest son, promise me.'

1575
01:54:09,956 --> 01:54:13,050
'Wherever l die,
you only will light my pyre.'

1576
01:54:21,101 --> 01:54:25,094
Pratap.. fulfill father's wish.

1577
01:54:57,370 --> 01:55:00,396
l'm there. l'm there.

1578
01:55:15,322 --> 01:55:18,223
What nonsense!
l'm your father's murderer!

1579
01:55:18,291 --> 01:55:20,020
Yes, because of
you my father is dead.

1580
01:55:20,994 --> 01:55:22,393
What father had told
me might not be sufficient..

1581
01:55:22,829 --> 01:55:25,389
..for the court
to prove you guilty.

1582
01:55:25,899 --> 01:55:27,457
But it is sufficient
to open my eyes.

1583
01:55:28,168 --> 01:55:29,897
From today all the ties,
that you had bonded..

1584
01:55:30,103 --> 01:55:32,094
..with us for the greed of money,
are broken.

1585
01:55:32,939 --> 01:55:34,031
Atul, stop!

1586
01:55:39,979 --> 01:55:44,211
Heard him! You saw the true
face of people dwelling in huts!

1587
01:55:44,284 --> 01:55:45,410
Yes, daddy.

1588
01:55:46,086 --> 01:55:49,146
The reality of people dwelling
in huts and villas too.

1589
01:55:49,422 --> 01:55:52,289
What.. what do you mean?
- lt is crystal clear.

1590
01:55:53,026 --> 01:55:57,292
Like how listening to his
father has opened Atul's eyes..

1591
01:55:57,797 --> 01:56:01,790
..similarly your and Chatur
Singh's land agreement..

1592
01:56:01,868 --> 01:56:03,130
..opened up my eyes.

1593
01:56:05,271 --> 01:56:07,136
Compared to such a deceiver
and billionaire father..

1594
01:56:07,941 --> 01:56:10,136
..a poor husband's
hut is much better.

1595
01:56:10,844 --> 01:56:13,335
At least its walls
are not painted with blood.

1596
01:56:14,381 --> 01:56:15,780
Let's go, Atul.

1597
01:56:17,951 --> 01:56:20,317
He is the most unfortunate
father in the world.

1598
01:56:21,187 --> 01:56:23,348
He is an affluent man.

1599
01:56:23,857 --> 01:56:27,349
But he will never be freed from
the loan of giving the bride away.

1600
01:56:27,994 --> 01:56:28,983
Never.

1601
01:56:29,696 --> 01:56:32,756
Dear! Dear! Dear, listen to me!

1602
01:56:33,433 --> 01:56:37,096
Where are you going searching
for your life in those ashes?

1603
01:56:40,940 --> 01:56:46,242
Hail Lord Ram!
Hail Lord Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1604
01:56:46,312 --> 01:56:50,078
Hail Lord Ram!
Hail Lord Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1605
01:56:50,283 --> 01:56:52,877
Keep it down. Carefully.

1606
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:10,096
Pratap. - What?

1607
01:57:12,071 --> 01:57:14,062
He is the same man who
had come to meet father that day.

1608
01:57:16,743 --> 01:57:19,871
Yes, l'm the same man who is
responsible for your father's death.

1609
01:57:22,882 --> 01:57:24,645
Now it is your turn.

1610
01:57:26,386 --> 01:57:28,411
Because Chatur Singh
has taken the oath..

1611
01:57:28,688 --> 01:57:30,178
..that he will smear the
ashes of both of your pyres..

1612
01:57:30,256 --> 01:57:31,723
..and then only will he eat food.

1613
01:57:32,959 --> 01:57:34,324
Here is your pyre.

1614
01:57:37,997 --> 01:57:42,661
Then why are you waiting?
Start with the eldest son.

1615
01:59:28,942 --> 01:59:30,807
Why are you anxious, Deshmukh?

1616
01:59:31,244 --> 01:59:33,405
By now they must
have turned into ashes.

1617
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:37,008
You don't trust your friends?

1618
01:59:38,251 --> 01:59:41,379
Now stop this speech,
my ear drums are tearing.

1619
01:59:41,654 --> 01:59:42,882
Enough.

1620
01:59:48,394 --> 01:59:49,827
Ramdeen!

1621
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:57,360
Who is it? - Don't shout!
And listen carefully!

1622
01:59:57,904 --> 01:59:59,997
You had asked for my ashes
to be smeared on your forehead.

1623
02:00:00,073 --> 02:00:02,473
l've send your cronies' ashes.
Smear it on your whole body.

1624
02:00:02,742 --> 02:00:05,176
Calm down! Calm down!

1625
02:00:06,045 --> 02:00:11,108
You don't have the guts to
light Chatur Singh's cronies' pyre.

1626
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:12,342
Calm down!

1627
02:00:12,619 --> 02:00:14,917
lf you don't believe me,
then crush those ashes and see.

1628
02:00:14,988 --> 02:00:17,218
You will find the memento
of your cronies in it.

1629
02:00:36,809 --> 02:00:39,107
Rascal!

1630
02:00:39,946 --> 02:00:42,676
You have put your
hand in the burning fire.

1631
02:00:43,449 --> 02:00:47,852
Now l will burn you in
such a way that your kin..

1632
02:00:48,087 --> 02:00:52,922
..won't even have your
ashes to immerse in the Ganga.

1633
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:54,687
Forget about burning me!

1634
02:00:54,761 --> 02:00:56,228
l will kill you in
such a way that you will..

1635
02:00:56,295 --> 02:00:58,229
..not even have land or the sky!

1636
02:00:59,465 --> 02:01:00,454
Atul-bhai! - Atul-bhai!

1637
02:01:00,733 --> 02:01:02,030
Atul-bhai,
an amazing thing has happened!

1638
02:01:02,101 --> 02:01:03,659
Come out and see what has happened!

1639
02:01:03,736 --> 02:01:04,896
What happened, brother Kalyan!

1640
02:01:04,971 --> 02:01:06,438
A notice has been put up.

1641
02:01:06,706 --> 02:01:08,469
Within 24 hours we have
to evacuate the community!

1642
02:01:08,741 --> 02:01:10,834
ls it somebody's heritage
that we will have to evacuate it!

1643
02:01:11,010 --> 02:01:12,875
We'll have to evacuate it.

1644
02:01:13,079 --> 02:01:15,206
Because Chatur Singh is
the owner of this community now.

1645
02:01:15,448 --> 02:01:16,915
Mr. Laxmidas has
sold the community!

1646
02:01:16,983 --> 02:01:18,245
And we came here after
reading the notice.

1647
02:01:18,317 --> 02:01:20,444
To hell with that
notice and Chatur Singh!

1648
02:01:20,853 --> 02:01:22,252
l'll just read the notice
and see it to it that..

1649
02:01:22,321 --> 02:01:23,948
No, Atul.
You won't do anything like that.

1650
02:01:24,023 --> 02:01:25,456
lt will adversely affect our case.

1651
02:01:25,692 --> 02:01:28,183
lf they've tried to evacuate
this place by using lawful means.

1652
02:01:28,261 --> 02:01:30,889
Then even we will take the
support of the law. Come with me.

1653
02:01:33,366 --> 02:01:35,163
Law and order is for everybody.

1654
02:01:35,968 --> 02:01:39,028
But in the eye of the
court what is illegal..

1655
02:01:39,505 --> 02:01:42,838
..for that l can't
do anything as ajudge.

1656
02:01:45,211 --> 02:01:47,372
This stay order is impossible!

1657
02:01:47,447 --> 02:01:50,041
Butjudge sir, if my father
had sold this property..

1658
02:01:50,116 --> 02:01:52,209
..to Chatur Singh then
l would at least have an inkling.

1659
02:01:52,285 --> 02:01:53,912
l would have had got the documents.

1660
02:01:54,287 --> 02:01:57,814
Judge sir, by using law
you put up the notice of making..

1661
02:01:57,890 --> 02:02:00,290
..thousands of people
homeless within 24 hours.

1662
02:02:00,359 --> 02:02:03,089
Then there has to be
some law to stop it too.

1663
02:02:03,162 --> 02:02:06,723
Ms. Megha, lawyers are
there to give suggestions.

1664
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:09,998
Judge's work is just
to give the decision.

1665
02:02:10,069 --> 02:02:13,266
l know. l know it very well,
judge sir.

1666
02:02:13,706 --> 02:02:16,300
This time too you took the bribe..

1667
02:02:16,676 --> 02:02:19,304
..and very cleverly gave
your decision on Friday evening.

1668
02:02:19,979 --> 02:02:21,776
Today is Saturday,
tomorrow is Sunday.

1669
02:02:21,848 --> 02:02:23,372
And day after tomorrow is
the public holiday of 'Navratri'.

1670
02:02:24,917 --> 02:02:26,885
But do keep one thing in mind,
judge sir.

1671
02:02:27,153 --> 02:02:30,850
The screams and curse
of poor people are potent.

1672
02:02:30,923 --> 02:02:33,050
And when God will
make the decision..

1673
02:02:33,426 --> 02:02:34,950
..then even you won't
be able to escape.

1674
02:02:35,027 --> 02:02:37,086
Chatur Singh, l don't know whether
God will forgive you or not!

1675
02:02:37,163 --> 02:02:39,222
But nobody can save you from me.

1676
02:02:39,298 --> 02:02:42,358
lf you are your father's son,
then appear before me once!

1677
02:02:44,804 --> 02:02:50,333
You bark a lot.
And l don't like dogs who bark.

1678
02:02:52,779 --> 02:02:57,341
lf you are your father's son,
then come to Mahalaxmi.

1679
02:02:57,817 --> 02:03:01,981
l go there every year to
worship the Goddess on 'Navratri'.

1680
02:03:02,054 --> 02:03:04,488
You can ask for as
many boons as you want.

1681
02:03:04,757 --> 02:03:06,384
This will be the last
worship of your life.

1682
02:03:29,982 --> 02:03:34,681
Hail Goddess Ambe(lndian goddess),
the mother of the world.

1683
02:03:34,754 --> 02:03:38,212
The world exists because of you.

1684
02:03:38,457 --> 02:03:42,450
Hail goddess Ambe,
the mother of the world

1685
02:03:42,728 --> 02:03:46,391
The world exists because of you.

1686
02:03:46,766 --> 02:03:50,361
No one can understand your miracles.

1687
02:03:50,436 --> 02:03:54,236
No one is beyond
your control, mother.

1688
02:03:54,740 --> 02:03:58,369
Hail goddess Ambe,
the mother of the world

1689
02:03:58,444 --> 02:04:02,437
The world exists because of you.

1690
02:04:02,715 --> 02:04:06,344
No one can understand your miracles.

1691
02:04:06,419 --> 02:04:10,253
No one is beyond
your control, mother.

1692
02:04:15,194 --> 02:04:17,458
Why have you come here?
Go away from here.

1693
02:04:50,696 --> 02:04:54,723
One who is in trouble
and in problems.

1694
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:58,497
You help him out.

1695
02:05:02,508 --> 02:05:04,806
You are the benefactor
of the world.

1696
02:05:04,844 --> 02:05:10,339
You solve everyone's problems.

1697
02:05:10,816 --> 02:05:14,718
You fill the emptiness
in everyone's life.

1698
02:05:14,787 --> 02:05:18,814
No one knows
how you will bless anyone.

1699
02:05:18,891 --> 02:05:22,759
No one can understand
your miracles.

1700
02:05:22,795 --> 02:05:26,390
No one is beyond
your control, mother.

1701
02:05:26,465 --> 02:05:30,424
Hail goddess Ambe,
the mother of the world

1702
02:05:30,836 --> 02:05:34,863
The world exists because of you.

1703
02:05:34,907 --> 02:05:38,900
No one can understand your miracles.

1704
02:05:38,978 --> 02:05:42,744
No one is beyond
your control, mother.

1705
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:19,080
You come as light in darkness.

1706
02:06:19,151 --> 02:06:23,144
You show way to
the ones who've strayed.

1707
02:06:27,126 --> 02:06:31,028
Protect your believers.

1708
02:06:31,097 --> 02:06:35,158
Wipe out the evil today.

1709
02:06:35,234 --> 02:06:43,164
Punish the torturer in such a way
that there is no sign left of them.

1710
02:06:43,242 --> 02:06:47,144
No one can understand
your miracles.

1711
02:06:47,213 --> 02:06:50,979
No one is beyond
your control, mother.

1712
02:06:51,050 --> 02:06:55,077
Hail goddess Ambe,
the mother of the world

1713
02:06:55,221 --> 02:06:59,055
The world exists because of you.

1714
02:06:59,091 --> 02:07:03,323
No one can understand
your miracles.

1715
02:07:03,396 --> 02:07:06,991
No one is beyond
your control, mother.

1716
02:07:52,011 --> 02:07:56,277
Hey queen goddess.
Hail goddess.

1717
02:07:56,348 --> 02:07:59,749
l've come to light
lamps before you.

1718
02:07:59,819 --> 02:08:07,692
Powerful Goddess, mother Kali,
l've come to pacify you.

1719
02:08:18,838 --> 02:08:22,968
Hey Mother Durga(lndian goddess) and
Chandi(another name of the goddess).

1720
02:08:23,042 --> 02:08:26,671
l'll sing praises of you today.

1721
02:08:26,745 --> 02:08:34,413
Every year
l'll offer flowers to you.

1722
02:08:45,731 --> 02:08:49,895
lt'll stop at your doorsteps.

1723
02:08:49,969 --> 02:08:53,166
Even if a storm comes.

1724
02:08:53,239 --> 02:08:57,175
Your blessings are with me.

1725
02:08:57,243 --> 02:09:01,304
Who can harm me?

1726
02:09:12,124 --> 02:09:14,058
What! Chatur Singh's murder!

1727
02:09:14,326 --> 02:09:15,816
Oh my God!

1728
02:09:15,861 --> 02:09:21,822
Oh my God!
He is killed! Who killed him?

1729
02:09:21,867 --> 02:09:23,767
Forget all these talks.

1730
02:09:23,802 --> 02:09:25,997
l'm worried as to what
will happen to this city?

1731
02:09:26,071 --> 02:09:27,265
What about all of us?

1732
02:09:27,339 --> 02:09:28,931
Don't argue, commissioner.

1733
02:09:29,175 --> 02:09:32,201
The person who can light
the pyre of a dangerous man..

1734
02:09:32,278 --> 02:09:34,712
..like Chatur Singh,
he can kill us very easily.

1735
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:36,441
But this will not happen, sir.

1736
02:09:36,682 --> 02:09:37,842
Listen to me, commissioner.

1737
02:09:37,917 --> 02:09:39,350
Tomorrow in T.V centre,
we all are going to be..

1738
02:09:39,418 --> 02:09:42,353
..interviewed in the
'Janta ki adalat' program.

1739
02:09:42,421 --> 02:09:45,913
Put up such security that even
a bird can't flutter its wings.

1740
02:09:45,991 --> 02:09:47,049
Understood!

1741
02:10:02,841 --> 02:10:05,332
Hey, Kadar!
You stand here. - Yes, sir.

1742
02:10:05,411 --> 02:10:06,969
Pandu, go back.

1743
02:10:10,649 --> 02:10:13,641
Today in 'Janta ki adalat'
before the public are..

1744
02:10:13,719 --> 02:10:16,847
..the minister,
Mr. Babanrao Deshmukh..

1745
02:10:17,256 --> 02:10:19,986
..the opposition leader,
Mr. Chandrasen Azad..

1746
02:10:20,359 --> 02:10:23,351
..the protector of law,
inspector Satyawadi Dube..

1747
02:10:23,662 --> 02:10:26,096
..Judge, Mr. Hukum Ali Javed..

1748
02:10:26,398 --> 02:10:29,959
..and the biggest builder
of the city, Yograj..

1749
02:10:30,069 --> 02:10:32,367
..all are here as culprits.

1750
02:10:33,038 --> 02:10:37,737
All of them have been
accused that for the recent..

1751
02:10:37,810 --> 02:10:40,301
..riots and murders in the city,
they were responsible for it.

1752
02:10:41,380 --> 02:10:42,972
ls it true, Mr. Deshmukh?

1753
02:10:43,983 --> 02:10:47,282
People call politics,
law and order and the police..

1754
02:10:47,319 --> 02:10:49,184
..as the 3 monkeys of Gandhi-ji.

1755
02:10:49,388 --> 02:10:51,822
The monkeys who don't hear,
see or say..

1756
02:10:52,358 --> 02:10:56,124
..even though everything
is happening before them.

1757
02:10:56,862 --> 02:10:59,990
Look, we live in
a democratic country.

1758
02:11:00,432 --> 02:11:03,299
And in democracy,
everybody has the right..

1759
02:11:03,669 --> 02:11:07,196
..to ask and say
anything that they want.

1760
02:11:07,773 --> 02:11:10,105
l don't agree with you.

1761
02:11:10,676 --> 02:11:14,043
lf this was true, then
compared with other countries..

1762
02:11:14,380 --> 02:11:17,872
..there wouldn't be so
much peace in our country.

1763
02:11:18,050 --> 02:11:19,745
lf there really is peace,
then why did..

1764
02:11:19,785 --> 02:11:22,253
..the riots happen
last week in our country?

1765
02:11:22,321 --> 02:11:25,222
Sir, all this is the
hand of foreign powers.

1766
02:11:25,291 --> 02:11:26,383
What can we do?

1767
02:11:26,425 --> 02:11:29,326
Look, Minister, whenever
there is a crisis in the country..

1768
02:11:29,395 --> 02:11:31,363
..then this is the standard
answer that ministers give.

1769
02:11:31,430 --> 02:11:33,125
The foreign powers
were involved in it.

1770
02:11:33,265 --> 02:11:36,166
Was the recent earthquake
also because of them?

1771
02:11:37,870 --> 02:11:40,464
Order! Order!
Please, maintain the silence.

1772
02:11:41,273 --> 02:11:43,935
People say that even
the opposition leader..

1773
02:11:44,009 --> 02:11:46,239
..Mr. Chandrasen
was involved in this.

1774
02:11:46,312 --> 02:11:49,941
Here! - All this is rubbish!
l don't agree to it!

1775
02:11:50,182 --> 02:11:52,116
My party's principles
are different.

1776
02:11:52,184 --> 02:11:53,913
His party's principles
are different.

1777
02:11:53,986 --> 02:11:56,921
How can we work together
with these different principles?

1778
02:11:57,323 --> 02:11:59,291
The goons are responsible for it.

1779
02:11:59,358 --> 02:12:01,087
Mr. Chandrasen is right.

1780
02:12:01,393 --> 02:12:03,452
The police are unnecessarily
being slandered.

1781
02:12:03,529 --> 02:12:04,962
This is what you have to say.

1782
02:12:05,030 --> 02:12:07,191
But people say that
at the time of riots..

1783
02:12:07,333 --> 02:12:10,302
..the police didn't reach
at the riot places on time.

1784
02:12:10,336 --> 02:12:12,395
This is the true
identity of our police.

1785
02:12:12,471 --> 02:12:15,167
They reach at the crime
scene after everything is over.

1786
02:12:29,988 --> 02:12:33,321
This is the sad part.
People misunderstand us.

1787
02:12:33,459 --> 02:12:36,257
People don't understand
our policies.

1788
02:12:36,328 --> 02:12:37,488
Now you only tell us.

1789
02:12:37,763 --> 02:12:40,732
lnstead of the huts,
there is a nice, clean colony.

1790
02:12:41,166 --> 02:12:45,159
lnstead of ramshackle village,
resources for our occupation.

1791
02:12:45,237 --> 02:12:47,068
Doesn't the country's
progress lies in this? Tell me.

1792
02:12:47,106 --> 02:12:49,404
But people say that
you people prosper more.

1793
02:12:49,441 --> 02:12:52,740
You all share the wealth
amongst yourselves.

1794
02:13:02,921 --> 02:13:05,151
The political leaders
and the police..

1795
02:13:05,858 --> 02:13:07,155
..have given theirjustifications.

1796
02:13:07,226 --> 02:13:09,319
Would you and Mr.
Yograj like to say anything?

1797
02:13:09,695 --> 02:13:12,255
lf in these matters people
doubt the protectors..

1798
02:13:12,331 --> 02:13:15,892
..of the law,
then what is left to say?

1799
02:13:16,835 --> 02:13:19,395
Look, we are businessmen.

1800
02:13:19,872 --> 02:13:22,705
We don't take goon's
help in our business.

1801
02:13:22,775 --> 02:13:24,970
Who doesn't take the aid of goons,
Mr. Yograj?

1802
02:13:25,177 --> 02:13:27,771
Now even the mafias have
entered the political scenario.

1803
02:13:28,013 --> 02:13:29,878
And even political
leaders are selected..

1804
02:13:29,948 --> 02:13:31,415
..on the basis of
their criminal records.

1805
02:13:31,483 --> 02:13:32,745
Am l right, Deshmukh-ji?

1806
02:13:32,818 --> 02:13:36,219
Before becoming a leader, you
used to smuggle silver from Daman.

1807
02:13:36,388 --> 02:13:40,051
Look, this is a wrong
accusation on me.

1808
02:13:40,125 --> 02:13:42,685
But you were a smuggler or not?

1809
02:13:46,231 --> 02:13:47,892
Even l don't believe this.

1810
02:13:48,100 --> 02:13:50,864
Because people say anything to
slander the image of big leaders.

1811
02:13:50,936 --> 02:13:53,234
Am l right, Mr. Chandrasen? - Yes.

1812
02:13:53,305 --> 02:13:56,069
l have one answer
to all your questions.

1813
02:13:56,275 --> 02:13:59,142
lf we are the culprits
in the public's eyes..

1814
02:13:59,211 --> 02:14:01,236
..then why are they silent?

1815
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:02,879
Answer me.

1816
02:14:03,081 --> 02:14:06,778
Why are they making us win the
elections for the past 15 years?

1817
02:14:07,853 --> 02:14:11,016
Judge, all the accusations
against us are baseless.

1818
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:13,985
This is what l have
to say in my justification.

1819
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:17,957
Now the decision lies
in your and the public's hands.

1820
02:14:18,030 --> 02:14:19,088
Declare it.

1821
02:14:20,766 --> 02:14:23,860
The real court couldn't
punish us hitherto..

1822
02:14:23,936 --> 02:14:25,904
..then what will this
public's court punish us?

1823
02:14:27,706 --> 02:14:29,765
Deshmukh,
very rarely do you speak the truth.

1824
02:15:06,345 --> 02:15:08,176
Do you have to say anything?

1825
02:15:08,213 --> 02:15:10,340
What do l say?
l did what l had to do.

1826
02:15:10,415 --> 02:15:11,973
l thought deeply before
taking this action.

1827
02:15:12,284 --> 02:15:14,684
Now you are the one who has to say.

1828
02:15:14,753 --> 02:15:15,845
l accept your decision.

1829
02:15:20,025 --> 02:15:21,322
Why doesn't he say anything?

1830
02:15:21,393 --> 02:15:22,655
Strange!

1831
02:15:22,728 --> 02:15:23,922
Order! Order!

1832
02:15:23,996 --> 02:15:26,089
'Today the judge, Vishwanath
Singh gave death sentence..

1833
02:15:26,164 --> 02:15:28,928
..to the killer of minister,
Mr. Babanrao Deshmukh..

1834
02:15:28,967 --> 02:15:31,197
..opposition leader,
Mr. Chandrasen Azad..

1835
02:15:31,270 --> 02:15:35,707
..Judge, Mr. Hukum Ali Javed,
inspector Satyawadi Dube..

1836
02:15:35,774 --> 02:15:40,404
..the builder Yograj
and Chatur Singh Chita..

1837
02:15:40,779 --> 02:15:43,304
..Pratap Narayan Tilak'

1838
02:15:56,395 --> 02:15:59,922
Death sentence for the crime
of killing people who are alive.

1839
02:16:01,700 --> 02:16:02,894
You saw, Pakya.

1840
02:16:03,235 --> 02:16:06,864
The blessings of Goddess
and bullet-proofjacket saved me.

1841
02:16:07,406 --> 02:16:11,274
But that rascal will
not die with death sentence.

1842
02:16:11,810 --> 02:16:14,904
Chatur Singh Chita will kill him.

1843
02:16:15,681 --> 02:16:17,376
Find out in which prison he is in!

1844
02:16:28,427 --> 02:16:29,689
Pratap!

1845
02:16:30,429 --> 02:16:32,761
Your date of hanging
has been fixed.

1846
02:16:33,865 --> 02:16:38,199
Do you have any last wish?
lt will be fulfilled.

1847
02:16:39,338 --> 02:16:44,002
l feel choked here. l don't
want to die within these 4 walls.

1848
02:16:44,076 --> 02:16:47,409
Hang me on the 'Kranti'
ground before everybody.

1849
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:50,071
From where the
rebellion had started.

1850
02:16:52,084 --> 02:16:56,783
You should die like a King.

1851
02:16:57,923 --> 02:17:01,188
Sir, somebody has come
to meet Pratap. - Bring her in.

1852
02:17:32,791 --> 02:17:33,883
Mother.

1853
02:17:35,994 --> 02:17:39,327
You've grown old. You've grown old.

1854
02:17:40,866 --> 02:17:44,165
Why are you crying?

1855
02:17:45,137 --> 02:17:48,766
No, these are tears of happiness.

1856
02:17:51,343 --> 02:17:53,834
l'd thought l will not see
your face for the rest of my life.

1857
02:17:56,782 --> 02:17:58,841
But when l read about
you in the newspaper..

1858
02:18:00,018 --> 02:18:01,451
..l couldn't control myself.

1859
02:18:02,854 --> 02:18:04,719
And l came to meet my son.

1860
02:18:06,191 --> 02:18:07,385
How are you?

1861
02:18:10,128 --> 02:18:16,897
Son.. today you've actually
made Tilak family proud.

1862
02:18:18,103 --> 02:18:20,901
l'm delighted. l've very happy.

1863
02:18:22,107 --> 02:18:28,137
Now l will pray to God to make you
my son in every birth. - No, mother.

1864
02:18:28,413 --> 02:18:32,315
l will cry as the wall of some
temple or mosque in next birth.

1865
02:18:34,252 --> 02:18:36,243
The tears of this
life are still remaining.

1866
02:18:41,059 --> 02:18:43,755
l'm sad because l couldn't
do anything for you.

1867
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:50,126
No, son. You did so much,
l got everything.

1868
02:18:50,936 --> 02:18:53,234
Even your grandpa's
soul will rest in peace.

1869
02:18:56,808 --> 02:18:58,867
l have only a single regret.

1870
02:18:59,778 --> 02:19:05,683
There will be no
descendants of Tilak family.

1871
02:19:11,256 --> 02:19:12,382
Look at this.

1872
02:19:13,024 --> 02:19:17,393
l'd kept it for my daughter-in-law.
But now..

1873
02:19:33,245 --> 02:19:36,112
Mother, she is the writer.

1874
02:19:38,850 --> 02:19:40,147
Megha, she writes.

1875
02:19:43,121 --> 02:19:45,885
Will you be the daughter-in-law
of our family for a day?

1876
02:19:48,894 --> 02:19:50,020
Think about it.

1877
02:21:12,244 --> 02:21:15,008
So you all have come
to see the show of my death!

1878
02:21:15,881 --> 02:21:17,314
Now they will hang me.

1879
02:21:17,782 --> 02:21:20,114
My tongue will come out
and my eyes will pop out!

1880
02:21:20,719 --> 02:21:24,018
l will hang for a few moments.
Then he will lower my body.

1881
02:21:24,089 --> 02:21:25,852
And you all will
go to your houses..

1882
02:21:25,924 --> 02:21:27,482
..eat dinner and then go to sleep.

1883
02:21:28,393 --> 02:21:30,725
Some day your unmanliness
and cowardliness..

1884
02:21:30,795 --> 02:21:33,855
..will see the death of
this country with this silence.

1885
02:21:34,099 --> 02:21:37,125
l don't want to say anything.

1886
02:21:37,702 --> 02:21:40,227
lt won't make a
difference in your lives!

1887
02:21:40,305 --> 02:21:42,432
You all are used
to live in darkness.

1888
02:21:42,707 --> 02:21:44,334
You all are used to slavery.

1889
02:21:44,376 --> 02:21:47,038
Previously you served the Kings,
then the British rule..

1890
02:21:47,112 --> 02:21:49,910
..and now few dishonest
leaders and goons.

1891
02:21:50,081 --> 02:21:53,050
They provoke you in the name of
religion and you kill each other.

1892
02:21:53,118 --> 02:21:54,915
Go ahead! Go ahead!

1893
02:21:54,986 --> 02:21:58,080
Even God must be
ashamed to see all this!

1894
02:21:58,390 --> 02:22:00,881
He must be pondering that l'd
created the most beautiful creation.

1895
02:22:00,959 --> 02:22:02,950
Humans! Humans!

1896
02:22:02,994 --> 02:22:05,292
When l looked below,
all l saw was worms.

1897
02:22:05,363 --> 02:22:09,231
Wriggle like worms! Wriggle
like worms! Rot and then die!

1898
02:22:09,301 --> 02:22:11,235
You came and went away!
The game is over!

1899
02:22:11,303 --> 02:22:13,669
You don't know why you lived,
why you died!

1900
02:22:15,473 --> 02:22:17,805
That writer lady wanted
to bring about a revolution!

1901
02:22:17,842 --> 02:22:20,811
With the power of her pen,
she wanted to change the present!

1902
02:22:20,879 --> 02:22:23,347
Who understood?
All are lifeless corpses!

1903
02:22:23,415 --> 02:22:25,713
Whom would she have had awakened!

1904
02:22:25,750 --> 02:22:28,014
l was awakened!
l am dying after doing a good deed.

1905
02:22:28,086 --> 02:22:29,144
l have the solace!

1906
02:22:29,220 --> 02:22:31,120
But remember,
your silence will tomorrow..

1907
02:22:31,189 --> 02:22:32,952
..be the reason of
crying for your children.

1908
02:22:33,024 --> 02:22:36,425
These police officers, political
leaders sold their conscience.

1909
02:22:36,695 --> 02:22:39,687
Where was your conscience
when you were killing each other?

1910
02:22:44,169 --> 02:22:50,267
Our neighboring country might not
be seen on the map in the future.

1911
02:22:50,342 --> 02:22:51,775
lt is forgetting one thing.

1912
02:22:52,077 --> 02:22:55,945
The flour that they eat
also comes from foreign countries.

1913
02:22:56,214 --> 02:22:58,375
They can't even manufacture
a pin in their country.

1914
02:22:58,450 --> 02:23:00,782
And they are weaving the
dream of destroying our country!

1915
02:23:01,286 --> 02:23:02,810
They can weave this dream because..

1916
02:23:02,887 --> 02:23:04,821
..they know that this
is country of corpses!

1917
02:23:04,889 --> 02:23:07,255
Nobody has sympathy
with their country land!

1918
02:23:08,159 --> 02:23:09,990
lt is very easy to
divide this country!

1919
02:23:10,061 --> 02:23:14,293
l'm Hindu! l'm Muslim!
l'm Sikh! l'm this and that!

1920
02:23:15,300 --> 02:23:16,927
Anybody can break a stick.

1921
02:23:17,002 --> 02:23:18,799
But it is difficult
to break a bundle of sticks.

1922
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:21,168
l'd studied in 3rd
standard in my school.

1923
02:23:21,373 --> 02:23:23,841
Why am l explaining to you all!
Why am l explaining!

1924
02:23:23,908 --> 02:23:26,376
l'm mad! l'm a fool!

1925
02:23:26,411 --> 02:23:28,242
Why am l talking to these stones!

1926
02:23:28,313 --> 02:23:31,043
Laugh! Go ahead and laugh!
Celebrate!

1927
02:23:31,116 --> 02:23:33,414
One more man is dying like
a dog for the cause of revolution.

1928
02:23:33,685 --> 02:23:34,709
Somebody else will die tomorrow!

1929
02:23:34,786 --> 02:23:35,946
lt doesn't make
any difference to us!

1930
02:23:36,121 --> 02:23:38,316
We will continue to live!
Am l right!

1931
02:23:38,390 --> 02:23:40,415
Go ahead and live your
lives the way you all want!

1932
02:23:40,692 --> 02:23:42,353
l don't want to
live a eunuch's life!

1933
02:23:42,427 --> 02:23:43,985
Hey! Come on!

1934
02:23:50,735 --> 02:23:53,966
Stop! This execution
has to be stopped!

1935
02:23:56,141 --> 02:23:59,008
The evidences that we
got against those traitors..

1936
02:23:59,277 --> 02:24:03,338
..prove that by killing them
Pratap has made our country proud.

1937
02:24:03,515 --> 02:24:07,007
So the Prime Minister of lndia
exonerated the death sentence.

1938
02:24:09,354 --> 02:24:10,946
Here are the documents.

1939
02:24:22,133 --> 02:24:23,691
Stop this execution!

1940
02:25:08,346 --> 02:25:10,780
Shoot him!
- Hey, beware commissioner!

1941
02:25:10,949 --> 02:25:12,143
There will be dead
bodies everywhere..

1942
02:25:12,217 --> 02:25:13,411
..if you tried to
intervene between us!

1943
02:26:22,453 --> 02:26:25,445
Hail the revolutionist!
Hail the revolutionist!

1944
02:26:25,723 --> 02:26:28,055
Hail the revolutionist!
Hail the revolutionist!

1945
02:26:28,126 --> 02:26:32,256
Hail the revolutionist!
Hail the revolutionist!
