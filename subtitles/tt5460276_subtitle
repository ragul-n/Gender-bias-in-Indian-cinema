1
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,294
How're you?
I'm fine

2
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,467
aren't you feeling excitment
In my voice?

3
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,441
I'll be there on time.

4
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,447
But mrs mukherjee If you'd
be there so It'd be good.

5
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,384
Are you scared with a girl.

6
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,424
If I say lie so no..
But truely a bit.

7
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,462
It's my first time so..

8
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,372
Is someone with you.?
Yes zafar.

9
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,313
What happened?
The chain slipped?

10
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,252
Your old cycle will
never get new twist

11
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,222
now what to do?
Fix It up

12
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:19,489
tell you father to buy you newone,
you know my father..

13
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:25,303
Your father is like parsi.

14
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,472
Pick up the bike.

15
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,444
Now learn It..

16
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,431
Tell me something,
how do you ride the cycle?

17
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:58,493
Trust and confidence,
If both are with, don't see path

18
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,504
how do you catch me
without seeing me.

19
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,312
Have you fixed the code
of everyone..

20
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,428
Did you see?

21
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:37,503
You're white,
but she's more white than you

22
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,309
your kids will not look
like a indian.

23
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,463
She's suprya sharma

24
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,303
rohan and supriya here,
me and you should sit there.

25
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,364
Paobhaji is famous here,
do I order some for you

26
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,310
I'll call the paobhaji for you

27
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,481
that zafar says anything..

28
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:40,304
Whenever mrs mukherjee
talk about you..

29
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,441
She always appreciates you

30
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:51,245
did she tell you about me?
Yes alot.

31
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,515
I'd never think about anyone.
If I wanted to marry

32
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,355
I'm obliged of mukherjee,
so I've come here.

33
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,325
I don't want to marry ever.

34
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,422
You please say no

35
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,526
say anything...
like..

36
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,304
Like you don't like me.

37
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:16,339
Means... I say lie while I don't want to

38
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:22,447
I do work, I earn money,
I'm not dependent on anyone.

39
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:27,343
But In real life,
two negative can't be positive

40
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,223
I don't want to marry too.

41
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:41,255
So... that's what..
Mrs mukherjee and her pressures.

42
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:55,304
I came to know that you're
confident In one meeting

43
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,420
do I say something.

44
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:15,231
The person who trust himself
is the strenght

45
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,305
you and me..
We're not weak.

46
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,302
So why're you scared of coming together.

47
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,209
Because dark can't make dark light.

48
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:41,517
But In the dark, If someone
is with you, so dark can decrease.

49
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:48,197
You've confused me..
Do you want to marry or not?

50
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,395
I want to marry but not now..

51
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,406
I want you to give
you some time.

52
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:04,443
About us.

53
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,483
Will you have some tea...

54
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:22,490
my friend picked her up.

55
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,353
So do we meet tomorrow,
where when?

56
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:20,323
Why?
If you want to ensure so It's important.

57
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,458
I goes to dance classes
on monday friday.

58
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,398
You literally make
people dance on your finger tips.

59
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,411
I understand..

60
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,392
Is It your happy birthday?

61
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:04,460
The love is blind I heared It,
but blind do love It's first time.

62
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,247

What will people think,
If we think what they'll think..

66

So what will they think?

67
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,263
How my shoes do I try more?

68
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,231
One more..

69
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,248
This is okay..
What?

70
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,315
It sounds good.

71
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,323
If you'll wear It,
I'll know how close are you

72
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,452
how far.

73
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,369
Is today a more crowd.

74
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,245
Don't need It.

75
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,248
I'm hungry

76
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,374

I want to go downstairs,

79
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:23,426
Where's the help desk.

80
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,283
There's nobody,
call the security for me.

81
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,227

So much passion.

87
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,333
You call her by yourself.

88
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,430
First your love story,
then mine.

89
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,423
Are you hearing me soup.

90
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,328
Don't know how I leaved your hand.

91
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:41,329
I'm speaking from the stage.

92
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,401

I'm not going anywhere.

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:08,483
There wasn't light,
but I felt darkness today..

100
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,364
I used to live alone.

101
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:20,268
But I felt the loneliness today.

102
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,408
We'll not keep much furniture
In our living room

103
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,251
the swing In balcony

104
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:10,240
the sun sets here In evening.

105
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,313
Parveen knows your tradition

106
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,315
and furnished your bedroom

107
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:57,256

109
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:06,265
Balloons.

110
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,237
What're you doing...

111
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,286
there are many kids In colony.

112
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,286
You're crazy..

113
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,488
Coming.

114
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,352
You can't do this..
It's a sin.

115
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,404
Game over.

116
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,349
How was It?

117
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,346
How do he dub without seeing It.

118
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,315
And In so many voices.

119
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,487
He hears In english,
and speaks In hindi.

120
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,368
Do you know who has come
In studio today?

121
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,272
Who?
Talk to him and guess.

122
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,403
How're you..?

123
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,477
I'm amitabh bachan,
rohan's friend..

124
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,352
How're you

125
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,487
since rohan met me,
he's talking about your beauty

126
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,425
all men are like that..

127
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,367
They don't talk like that
before the wife.

128
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:35,499
It's jiya's complaint too

129
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,315
may your marriage life remain happy

130
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,456
did you hear, how he blessed us.

131
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:58,262
Do amir khan comes
In your studio..?

132
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,293
I'll bring all the khans on
the evening meal.

133
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,333
We're going to eat out.

134
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,417
You gave me dangerous
love bite last night.

135
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,478
I'm dubbing artist,
today I was silent.

136
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,349
As he tell me that, I'm hiding.

137
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,362
Who started.

138
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:41,320
Is that you amit?

139
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,487
I'm scared..
Lets go...

140
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,230
I know him..
Why're you playing hide and seek.

141
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,464
If you want to say something
so come In front of me.

142
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:57,501
How do you recognize me..
Your nose is dangerous..

143
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,503
Get outta my way.
You said come In front.

144
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,477
Okay I leave It.

145
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,383
Listen to me..
I wanted to ask you something.

146
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,390
I tried alot, can't even pick up a maid..

147
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,401
You hit the aim In darkness.

148
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,334
Behave yourself, she's my wife.

149
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,465
Leave me collar.

150
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:39,483
What's this?

151
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:44,215
It seems that our handsome
made the blue film

152
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,493
did you bite her?

153
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,520
Where did you bite her/

154
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,295
I'll see It.

155
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:05,407
Don't take me weak,
I'm saying It first and last time.

156
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,219
What happened supriya,
why're you yelling.

157
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:20,382
Nobody else is there except you both

158
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,296
they're gone.

159
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:47,383
I don't know anything,
what you told me while booking flat.

160
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:52,287
I'll give It In december,
how can you say next year.

161
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,420
I don't know anything.

162
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,391
I want the possesion
In one month or my money.

163
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:15,268
What I should do that night,
whne you slapped that guy

164
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,245
so why you didn't.

165
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,322
What's this?
My fridge is broken down.

166
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,397
Will you keep the milk In your friedge.

167
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,269
Do you know who had come
In studio, amir khan..

168
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,330
I wanted to connect you,
but you didn't pick up the call

169
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,434
you're strange,
It was good chance.

170
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,275
Answer me atleast.

171
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,352
What happened?

172
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,363
Are you allright?

173
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:37,420
On your wife's statement,
we have taken amit In custody.

174
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:42,257
But In that case,
medical report is necessary

175
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:46,326
have to do right now.

176
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,496
Because we can only keep
them In remand In medical report.

177
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,453
She can't identify them
and they didn't speaked.

178
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:17,519
So can't recognize the voice.

179
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,260

We can't live like before.

211
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:49,262
Everything was dream before yesterday.

212
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:08,482
The food is on table,

213
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:01,400
Your wife is so nice that,

00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:03,370
but can't stay silent.

215
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:38,246
I'm really sorry for yesterday.

216
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:42,349
I stayed silent,
because what I'd say.

217
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:51,324
Yesterday I felt weak..

218
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:55,356
I was angry with myself.

219
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:30,403
Your wife was look good.

220
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:40,516

Don't know why I'm feeling that
you'll not vote for me this time.

222
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:57,467
The youngness is like
the horse of race.

223
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:02,276
It starts when gun fires.

224
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,440
The passion circulate more than blood.

225
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:09,342
I was young once.

226
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,277
Like a amit.

227
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:17,386
That woman In your colony,
wife of matre..

228
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:20,487
But couldn't do anything.

229
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:33,499
But amit has support.

230
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,478
Mine.

231
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:41,382
Amit can do what I couldn't do.

232
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:48,390
Police is mine,
I got him released.

233
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:55,430
I'm sad too

234
00:58:56,432 --> 00:59:01,495
It was newly marriage.

00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,506
And she died.

236
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:09,377
But you celebrated the golden night.

237
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,215
But got nothing special.

238
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:23,316
Don't talk to media,
and colony people.

239
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:27,228
As much you'll talk,
as much you'll be dishonored.

240
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,358
That day you didn't hear my voice.

241
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,531
Now listen today,

242
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:01,376

01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:04,412
We'll push you whenever we want to.

245
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:22,307

250
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,366
There's no case of yours..
You're fraud.

251
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:44,337
Don't come next time here.

252
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:49,369

01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,372

258
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:23,438
He's talking rubbish,

259
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:27,298
I'll not do this mistake
again for complaint.

260
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:34,313

You'll not need any f.I.r
or medical check up.

267
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:09,250
Only the need will be
of a postmortem

268
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:50,290

but can't explain.

do you have any witness who can
say that you were at house.

337
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:17,508
What kind of question is that..

338
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:21,513
Do people keep each other
witness before going to sleep?

339
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:26,486
But why're you asking me this?

340
