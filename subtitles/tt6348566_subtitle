1
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:36,140
A path

2
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:39,308
We often think it's the
passage to commute

3
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,248
But here..

4
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:42,708
behind every path
there is a history

5
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:47,381
That history tells us about the
caste and the inequalities

6
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,676
Sometime back streets were named as big
street, small street and crossroads

7
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:54,323
Later slowly they started
incorporating caste names in it.

8
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:58,137
When they separated
paths based on caste

9
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:01,381
It's when violence and
hatred started brewing

10
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:04,371
One such village is
this Pudhur village

11
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:07,578
Opposing this bias is
this senior Kalimuthu

12
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:10,332
He has staged several protests

13
00:02:10,952 --> 00:02:12,266
and written many
book regarding this

14
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:15,481
If people from
Kalimuthu's caste die

15
00:02:15,788 --> 00:02:17,770
They have to take them through
this path to the crematorium

16
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:19,851
If the rain fills the well

17
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:22,603
then they have to walk around
the village for 6 miles

18
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:25,810
If they take this path,
it's much shorter

19
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:27,984
But the village head
does not permit it.

20
00:02:28,137 --> 00:02:30,461
This man Kalimuthu who
protested against this

21
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:32,123
Died 3 days back

22
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:37,812
His comrade Chinnarasu wanted
him to be carried on this path

23
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:40,310
For which he filed a case
in the Court of Madurai

24
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:47,134
Grandma have some tea

25
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:49,982
How long will you
keep him like this?

26
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:51,142
Shouldn't you be
cremating him soon?

27
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:52,988
We will do it soon,
have your tea.

28
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,070
What time is the verdict?

29
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:01,122
It's around 10 am.

30
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:02,762
If it's in our favor

31
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:04,890
We can cremate him by noon.

32
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:11,066
This Court orders that the mortal remains of
Kalimuthu of Madurai district, Pudhur village

33
00:03:11,194 --> 00:03:15,199
Shall be taken through the common pathway and
the police should provide due protection.

34
00:03:25,677 --> 00:03:27,416
Just because the Court orders,
can they use this path?

35
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:29,454
All along they have
only used the other way

36
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,851
Why suddenly they
want this path?

37
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:34,037
Just because the rain water has filled
the wells, can they enter the village?

38
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:35,067
Inferior people.

39
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,139
Now they want to
go with the corpus

40
00:03:37,306 --> 00:03:38,877
Then they will want to come and
seek an alliance with our girls

41
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:40,417
Can we spare them like this?

42
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,556
Kananavelu, since you refused
they sought the help of the Court

43
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:44,793
Now how can you retract?

44
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,653
The village is for
everyone not just you.

45
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:48,387
Even the cattle go
through that path.

46
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,628
Why can't they go?

47
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:51,148
Why should it be
reserved for you?

48
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:54,644
When we are born are we
differentiated on caste and creed?

49
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:57,096
After death it's all
just mortal remains.

50
00:03:57,643 --> 00:04:00,177
So you want us to be like
you, without any norms?

51
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,815
You want me to eat the food
here and clean the hands there?

52
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:04,924
I follow everything.

53
00:04:05,463 --> 00:04:06,302
I am like this

54
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:08,153
Your slipper is
meant for the feet.

55
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:10,296
You can't take pity and
carry it on your head

56
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:11,780
You will become the
laughing stock then.

57
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:16,485
Those who can't get a square meal
are talking about socialism.

58
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:19,982
Subramaniam, you are
born in our caste right?

59
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:25,772
Lawyer, won't your
creed criticize you?

60
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:28,227
We came here, because
you called us

61
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:29,408
I don't think this will
come to a conclusion.

62
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:30,877
You continue talking,
we will leave.

63
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:39,641
See the Court has only directed that the
corpus can go through the common path

64
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:42,125
It's not said that
they should carry it.

65
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:45,397
Selvaraj, talk like a policeman!

66
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:47,700
Then what's the difference
between both of you?

67
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:50,057
No Sir, this is solution to
solve it without any problem

68
00:04:51,898 --> 00:04:52,743
Sir!

69
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:56,072
To take that one man, they might
have to let go of 10 other lives

70
00:04:57,025 --> 00:04:58,563
Tell that man, Chinnarasu.

71
00:05:10,638 --> 00:05:12,557
What? We should hand
him over to you?

72
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:13,967
Is he some orphan?

73
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:17,118
He was one amongst us and gave
his life for our well being.

74
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:19,701
We will perform his rites and
will not give him to you.

75
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:22,215
Chinnarasu don't create
problems, you should let go.

76
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:24,447
We are letting it go

77
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,923
we don't know when
they will give.

78
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:27,840
You are not cooperating.

79
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,661
we have a verdict in our favor.

80
00:05:29,686 --> 00:05:32,311
The Court has only directed that the
corpse can go on the common path,

81
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,965
It does not say you can take it.

82
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:36,643
Can you see how they are
interpreting the order! - Yes.

83
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:40,082
Chinnarasu, if you take him, they are
threatening that they will engage in violence

84
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:41,177
Cut us!

85
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:44,139
Will our weapons be still
till they slit us?

86
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:45,164
Muthu!

87
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:50,449
If you want go back to the
Court and get a revised order,

88
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:51,497
then we will cooperate.

89
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:58,775
Fine Sir.

90
00:05:59,644 --> 00:06:00,934
Do it as you say!

91
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,817
Thanks, Chinnarasu.

92
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,578
Even if we didn't carry,

93
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:28,331
our leader's body came
through their path.

94
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,246
There will be a day

95
00:06:31,678 --> 00:06:34,132
when we can carry it ourselves
through their path.

96
00:08:49,257 --> 00:08:51,676
(chattering)

97
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:54,650
Don't go near the cow

98
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,139
(chattering)

99
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,327
Look at Kittu!

100
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:06,229
It's such a big moment
and look at him.

101
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,333
Come here!

102
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,753
Kittu! Kittu come.

103
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,482
Why is everyone here?
- I don't know.

104
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:17,478
What is it? - Come here

105
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:19,503
What is it?

106
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,450
Come here.

107
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,392
What is it?

108
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,924
You have scored the first
mark in Tamil Nadu

109
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:28,538
You photograph is
on the newspaper.

110
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:36,958
Hey. This is great!
Congratulations.

111
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:39,279
We are very happy.

112
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:43,410
We only read news that someone was
killed or burnt alive from this region.

113
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:45,279
To see a news like this

114
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:46,728
It feels like we have
conquered the world.

115
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:48,877
Don't let go.

116
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:50,043
You should aim higher.

117
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:52,528
You should gather a huge following
that will come with you.

118
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,704
Academics is knowledge.

119
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:55,729
It's external.

120
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:57,249
There is something
more important.

121
00:09:58,716 --> 00:10:00,705
Love and selflessness.
Living for others.

122
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:02,246
Don't forget that.

123
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:05,045
I won't forget anything
that you have taught.

124
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:07,514
Alright what are you
going to do after this?

125
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,294
Chinnarasu, what are you asking?

126
00:10:09,752 --> 00:10:14,584
You are behind the
education of both of them.

127
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:17,101
You tell him please.

128
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:19,232
Yes, brother.

129
00:10:19,354 --> 00:10:20,645
What mother says is true.

130
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,486
You tell me what I
should do further.

131
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:23,604
Why are you asking me?

132
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:26,116
Well. You should
become a Collector.

133
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:29,246
As you are in college,
prepare for your IAS.

134
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:33,593
Also tomorrow we have planned a
felicitation for you in our school.

135
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:36,372
The District Collector is
coming down to felicitate you.

136
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:40,432
We request the esteemed chief
guest- the District Collector

137
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:43,253
To say a few words.

138
00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:46,818
My greeting to all.

139
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:50,299
My hearty congratulations to Krishnakumar for
securing the highest scores in the State

140
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,284
Thank you, Sir. - Welcome.

141
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:58,809
It's no easy task to
secure the State first,

142
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:01,495
hailing from a small
village like Pudhur

143
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,317
That too from a
Government school.

144
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:05,950
More than the wealth
one has earned

145
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:08,702
One should show how much
knowledge they have gained

146
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:11,676
I heard that Chinnarasu

147
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,698
was instrumental
in his education.

148
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:15,754
I am delighted.

149
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:17,824
My congratulations
to you as well.

150
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:20,048
Thank you.

151
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:25,583
After 2 Years

152
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,031
Aunty can I spin it!

153
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,611
Sir, we had asked for 10 women
for transplanting paddy

154
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,259
Sir today, it's totally
8 women working.

155
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:07,007
Mariamma has fallen sick.

156
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:08,032
So...

157
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:09,482
Father! I will leave now.

158
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:10,900
Be careful.

159
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,382
I will manage with
this work force.

160
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,443
If you can be liberal
about the money...

161
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:38,959
To review the water
scarcity in Chennai

162
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:41,068
the Chief minister of Tamil
Nadu M G R will hold talks with

163
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:43,254
The chief minister of Andhra Pradesh MR.
N T Rama Rao

164
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:46,849
They will hold joint discussions
- That's good.

165
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:49,253
The bus is here -
Why are you late?

166
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:51,484
My mother delayed
packing my lunch.

167
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:53,710
Make it fast.

168
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:54,705
How are you? - Fine!

169
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:55,737
Let's leave.

170
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,910
Hey! The bus is not here yet!
- Can we go by cycle?

171
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:02,012
Are you so studious?
- He's looking for something

172
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:05,403
Don't trouble him.
- It's the only option we have.

173
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:07,944
The bus has arrived.

174
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:32,960
He's looking at you.

175
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:34,725
Rani! Wait for a minute.

176
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,106
For what?

177
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:39,999
What's this?

178
00:13:40,197 --> 00:13:41,197
Take this Rani.

179
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,912
You know we are from
different segments.

180
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:45,139
You know what will happen
if my father knows!

181
00:13:45,413 --> 00:13:48,658
What! Your problem is that
I am not from your caste?

182
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:50,587
Yes.

183
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,020
Look Rani.

184
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,698
If you say you don't
like me I will go away.

185
00:13:56,862 --> 00:13:59,364
Till death I will love you

186
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:02,467
You will be my wife.

187
00:14:17,977 --> 00:14:19,246
I can't handle him.

188
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:20,896
I am wondering if I should
complain to my father about him.

189
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:23,998
What! Rani enrolled
in your college

190
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:25,611
What are you saying? - Yes.

191
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:26,675
Fate.

192
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:28,384
Then Subash will start again.

193
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:29,675
He already has.

194
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,545
Surprising! You
both are going out!

195
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,162
Yes after 3 years he's
taking me for a movie!

196
00:14:34,226 --> 00:14:36,765
That's the fate of people's man.

197
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:37,833
Have some tea.

198
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:38,908
Ask for two!

199
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,006
Two..

200
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:44,049
He's some silly guy
offering you tea,

201
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:46,926
you should politely refuse!

202
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:49,861
I feel like.. Always erring.

203
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:51,905
You take brother and
go for the movie.

204
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:53,806
Move!

205
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,370
How much do they owe you?

206
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,271
Rupees 61.

207
00:14:58,072 --> 00:14:59,072
For this!

208
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,014
Tea for the two of us.

209
00:15:03,397 --> 00:15:04,636
and one more round of
tea for all of them.

210
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:07,461
One tea for you?

211
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,118
Have you told the Senior!

212
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:18,019
It he who told me to see you.

213
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:19,678
My stomach is churning.

214
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:22,125
Don't mess up this place.

215
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:24,250
Hold on till brother is here.

216
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:26,699
We can we handle the police

217
00:15:26,912 --> 00:15:28,449
But I can't handle this!

218
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:41,005
Fine I will come during lunch.

219
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:42,173
Thanks.

220
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:45,693
Come Chinnarasu.

221
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,424
I was wondering why you
are not here as yet!

222
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:52,593
What's the reason today?

223
00:15:57,836 --> 00:16:00,551
Your people have pelted
stones on the bus.

224
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:02,948
I have arrested them
on suspicious grounds.

225
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:07,448
Towards the end of every month

226
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:09,106
as you want to close
your case files

227
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:10,914
You arrest our people

228
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:12,597
I will have to come
and seek justice.

229
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:14,629
Your arguments are unjust.

230
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:17,043
This is an ongoing process.

231
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,370
Don't think we will keep
bending to atrocities.

232
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:23,936
One day we decide to stand up,

233
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,445
you will not be spared.

234
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:30,094
What Chinnarasu, your
views are strong.

235
00:16:30,477 --> 00:16:32,182
Your father worked
as a servant for us.

236
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:34,630
It's from the wages
that we paid,

237
00:16:34,845 --> 00:16:36,183
you are sitting and talking.

238
00:16:36,603 --> 00:16:37,970
My father was your servant.

239
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:40,410
Now you are a servant
for all of us.

240
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,350
You don't understand?

241
00:16:43,914 --> 00:16:45,939
This uniform makes
you a servant.

242
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:47,930
A government servant
who works for the us.

243
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:50,945
Your salary is from
the tax payers money.

244
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:53,501
Meaning, we pay you the wages

245
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:56,255
Selvarasu!

246
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,371
You need to delete that
your father is a landlord.

247
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:01,099
You should stop working
for your clan.

248
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:04,237
Hereafter work for the people.

249
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:07,953
Attitude because
you are educated?

250
00:17:10,518 --> 00:17:11,843
Pay the fine and take them.

251
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:14,598
Leave. - Okay, brother.

252
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:17,981
Wear your shirt.

253
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:18,682
They tore it.

254
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:19,691
Chinnarasu!

255
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,721
Today you are there
to save them.

256
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:31,438
There might a time when
you might be here.

257
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:33,507
As you point fingers at me,

258
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:38,011
you might have to fold hands and
talk to me that time will come.

259
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:57,528
I will sit inside you
sit in the corner.

260
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,620
Okay.

261
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,457
You ask her to go there. - Why?

262
00:18:02,627 --> 00:18:03,701
I am telling you.

263
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:06,312
You go there Rathi, come here.

264
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,592
Why? - I am telling you.

265
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:16,351
Why did you say that?

266
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:18,169
She's from the lower strata,

267
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:20,107
we can't allow her
to sit with us.

268
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,420
Where will I go?

269
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:28,919
It was Friday.

270
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:30,209
so I went to the temple.

271
00:18:30,304 --> 00:18:32,264
Did you come to the
temple yesterday?

272
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:35,846
Leave it!

273
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:36,911
Why do we create a problem?

274
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:39,996
We should not leave it.

275
00:18:40,395 --> 00:18:41,912
What's he doing?
- You know about him.

276
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:46,419
Hey! Get up

277
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:48,754
Why? - I am telling you!

278
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,241
You have studied till 12th?

279
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,588
Haven't you read this?

280
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:59,394
UNTOUCHABILITY IS INHUMANE.

281
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:06,155
What are you staring at?

282
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:09,023
Keep your caste out
of the college

283
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:11,288
Else will thrash you.

284
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,102
After paying so much now you
are refusing to go to college?

285
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:24,979
I don't like it, why
are you bothering me?

286
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,980
Why are you angry with mother?

287
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:30,317
You are the first one in the
family to study in a college.

288
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:31,872
Now what do we do if you resist?

289
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,934
Why are you scolding her?

290
00:19:35,552 --> 00:19:36,647
Come here, dear.

291
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:40,151
Sit down.

292
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:49,516
Did the lecturer say something?

293
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:53,247
Did some boys scold you?

294
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:54,954
No.

295
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,638
Don't hold your
emotions, tell me dear.

296
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:00,706
Father.

297
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:04,394
I am scared to go to college.

298
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:06,533
I want to know the reason.

299
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:09,694
She says she's scared.

300
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:11,461
I will take you dear.

301
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:16,225
Hey! That girl - Which girl?

302
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:19,493
You didn't know it
was his daughter!

303
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,518
Didn't you know it?

304
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:22,712
It's going be a huge mess.
- Get down.

305
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,181
Kittu someone has
scolded her in college.

306
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:28,358
Gomathi, show him who that is.

307
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:30,402
Don't worry.

308
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:31,868
Kittu will take
care of everything.

309
00:20:34,214 --> 00:20:35,214
Give way.

310
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,949
See how he's staring.

311
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:15,802
Forget your ego and
apologize to her.

312
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:19,233
If Chinnarasu brother know,
it will become a huge issue.

313
00:21:32,242 --> 00:21:33,715
Gomathi. - Pardon me.

314
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,559
She saying what I wanted to say.

315
00:21:36,784 --> 00:21:39,506
I listened to my
friend and said that.

316
00:21:41,523 --> 00:21:45,659
Please don't tell
this to my father.

317
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:47,417
My father will kill me.

318
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:49,752
So you are not apologizing
form your heart.

319
00:21:49,862 --> 00:21:51,841
You are doing it because
you're scared of your father.

320
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:55,273
No. - Look.. Happiness or sorrow

321
00:21:55,376 --> 00:21:57,696
Tears are the only witness.

322
00:21:58,588 --> 00:22:00,471
If you shed a drop of tear

323
00:22:00,773 --> 00:22:03,677
then all the pain and negativity will vanish
from you heart and you will feel light

324
00:22:04,217 --> 00:22:05,837
Don't be scared I won't
tell your father.

325
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,261
Kittu! Principal is calling us.

326
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:11,913
Try to change for real.

327
00:22:19,643 --> 00:22:20,421
Krishnakumar.

328
00:22:20,517 --> 00:22:24,923
compile the list of students
coming for the dam trip.

329
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:26,057
Okay, sir.

330
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:28,944
Hello!

331
00:22:29,794 --> 00:22:31,169
Palani Murugan college.

332
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,830
Good morning sir!

333
00:22:34,443 --> 00:22:35,443
When Sir?

334
00:22:37,035 --> 00:22:38,035
Okay, sir.

335
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,650
Okay, sir.

336
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:45,066
As we have the exams next month
- An important announcement.

337
00:22:45,987 --> 00:22:47,349
It's with great sorrow
we announce that

338
00:22:47,781 --> 00:22:55,467
Our Honb'le Chief Minister M G
Ramachandran died this morning.

339
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:00,115
I ask all of you to stand
for a moment in silence.

340
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:12,157
Today and tomorrow are declared
as holidays for the college.

341
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:16,032
I request you all to
disperse in peace.

342
00:23:18,884 --> 00:23:21,304
They say the buses
are not plying.

343
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:24,246
Then we have to
rely on our feet.

344
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:30,616
Sister! Let me carry
the child It's alright

345
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,046
It's alright.
- No give the child to me.

346
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:32,812
Hold this.

347
00:23:33,002 --> 00:23:34,344
Go with uncle.

348
00:23:35,692 --> 00:23:36,500
Lift her.

349
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:44,148
You should tell us when
you want to urinate.

350
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:45,783
Don't do it on him.

351
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:48,043
Don't give her ideas.

352
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:49,546
Listen - Tell me.

353
00:23:51,994 --> 00:23:55,498
Why can't we let the women
walk ahead and we trail them?

354
00:23:55,721 --> 00:23:58,008
Don't invite trouble.

355
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,470
Just come. - That true.

356
00:24:03,895 --> 00:24:05,544
Carry my books too.

357
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:07,676
You need assistance for that?

358
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:19,270
I am scared to come on this path alone
- Are we alone!

359
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:25,049
What happened?

360
00:24:25,454 --> 00:24:27,357
A snake!

361
00:24:28,985 --> 00:24:30,998
Grandma!

362
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:32,932
she is bit by a snake.

363
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:35,317
Someone is bit by a snake.

364
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,391
Move..

365
00:24:36,497 --> 00:24:37,772
Come soon.

366
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:40,959
What do we do now?

367
00:24:41,627 --> 00:24:43,452
Someone give me your waistband.

368
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,001
I have mine.

369
00:24:50,111 --> 00:24:51,111
Take it.

370
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:52,839
Tie it hard.

371
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:54,577
Tie it a bit high.

372
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:56,397
Then it won't spread.

373
00:24:56,922 --> 00:24:58,287
It's a very venomous snake.

374
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,007
The venom will creep
to the head soon.

375
00:25:00,121 --> 00:25:02,524
If you can take her to the hospital
in an hour, you can save her.

376
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:03,882
That soon!

377
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:06,864
It's over 6 miles to the
hospital from here.

378
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:09,288
Don't waste time
let's carry her.

379
00:25:09,364 --> 00:25:11,046
They will condemn if we see her

380
00:25:11,073 --> 00:25:12,176
You want us to carry her?

381
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:14,642
Let's carry her.

382
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Be quite.

383
00:25:16,189 --> 00:25:18,065
They should consent first.

384
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:22,303
If we keep aside our
differences and unite

385
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:24,278
we can save this girl's life.

386
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,599
Ask them to carry.

387
00:25:37,415 --> 00:25:38,415
Carry her.

388
00:25:38,893 --> 00:25:39,600
Come on.

389
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:43,245
How will you carry this
young girl for 6 miles?

390
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:07,674
All life is one.

391
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:14,042
Let's unite today.

392
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:17,477
The crows and
sparrows are my caste

393
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:20,219
Said the great poet Bharathi.

394
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:23,277
To win this world with love

395
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,139
Let's redefine destiny

396
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,965
If you have humanity

397
00:26:29,093 --> 00:26:31,507
That will heal all the wounds..

398
00:26:31,976 --> 00:26:33,233
it will heal.

399
00:26:34,338 --> 00:26:37,176
Let's unite, let's unite

400
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,005
Till our hearts bloom.

401
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,346
Let's unite, let's unite

402
00:26:43,014 --> 00:26:45,774
To break the barriers.

403
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:48,124
Let's unite, let's unite

404
00:26:48,748 --> 00:26:51,244
To save mankind.

405
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:52,621
Let's unite.

406
00:27:03,418 --> 00:27:08,495
All life is one.

407
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,125
Let's unite today.

408
00:27:14,863 --> 00:27:17,582
What's high and what's low.

409
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:20,332
Why should we have
this division?

410
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:23,256
With kindness and love

411
00:27:23,321 --> 00:27:26,043
This boundaries will blur.

412
00:27:26,302 --> 00:27:28,915
Fragrance is the
beauty of the flower

413
00:27:29,132 --> 00:27:31,778
Love is the wish of this world

414
00:27:31,927 --> 00:27:33,839
it's the wish.

415
00:27:34,473 --> 00:27:36,840
Let's unite, let's unite

416
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:40,073
Till our hearts bloom

417
00:27:40,252 --> 00:27:42,673
Let's unite, let's unite

418
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:45,590
To break the barriers

419
00:27:45,942 --> 00:27:47,492
Let's unite let's unite

420
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,705
To save mankind.

421
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:17,708
Poor, downtrodden

422
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:20,220
The rain does not
discriminate when it pours.

423
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:23,425
Are you bigger or me

424
00:28:23,465 --> 00:28:26,102
The earth does not revolve
fighting around this

425
00:28:26,522 --> 00:28:29,031
Trees symbolise breeze

426
00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:31,611
Land symbolise abundance

427
00:28:31,994 --> 00:28:34,686
Nature does not know division.

428
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:37,495
It only seeks harmony.

429
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:43,221
Let's learn everything
Mankind mankind

430
00:28:43,453 --> 00:28:48,741
Let's help as much as we
can Let's banish sorrow..

431
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:50,179
sorrow..

432
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:53,931
Let's unite, let's unite

433
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:57,039
Till our hearts bloom

434
00:28:57,287 --> 00:29:00,042
Let's unite, let's unite

435
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:02,885
To break the barriers

436
00:29:03,087 --> 00:29:05,413
Let's unite, let's unite.

437
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,459
To save mankind

438
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:10,540
Let's unite.

439
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,780
It's alright.

440
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:53,049
Lives become one.

441
00:29:53,713 --> 00:29:58,925
A new bond is formed.

442
00:29:59,402 --> 00:30:02,366
When the heart is
filled with love

443
00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:05,205
Even the stone becomes a God.

444
00:30:05,281 --> 00:30:08,072
To show the true affection

445
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:10,755
Tears are sufficient.

446
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,776
Everything will change one day.

447
00:30:13,806 --> 00:30:16,535
Time will show us the way..

448
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:18,516
will show us the way.

449
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,192
You lower clan fellow!

450
00:30:26,217 --> 00:30:29,088
How dare you touch our girl?

451
00:30:29,234 --> 00:30:30,022
Uncle!

452
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,543
If he hadn't carried her, Rani
would have been dead by now.

453
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,550
Let her die. Who are
you to touch her?

454
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:36,791
Will kill you.

455
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,895
I am telling you. Keep quite.

456
00:30:45,685 --> 00:30:46,909
I did it unintentionally.

457
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,644
Please pardon me.

458
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:08,619
Uncle, these boys were scared
to even look at our girls.

459
00:31:09,104 --> 00:31:10,104
Now they have the audacity
to touch and carry them.

460
00:31:10,153 --> 00:31:11,153
Where did they get this courage?

461
00:31:11,545 --> 00:31:13,657
Even when the bus
route was extended,

462
00:31:13,796 --> 00:31:15,180
so many of the, didn't
go for higher education.

463
00:31:23,629 --> 00:31:25,641
Speak to the MLA

464
00:31:26,532 --> 00:31:28,698
and tell him I seek
him assistance

465
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:32,094
Stop the bus service
for their path.

466
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
Sure, sir. Will do.

467
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:39,325
Without the bus, how long can we
walk every day for the school?

468
00:31:41,475 --> 00:31:43,172
If you want me to be
specific about this scheme

469
00:31:43,252 --> 00:31:45,542
It's for the housing and welfare
of the underprivileged.

470
00:31:45,975 --> 00:31:47,954
It comes under the
Central Government.

471
00:31:48,831 --> 00:31:51,188
If your village President
does not corporate

472
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:53,660
you can individually
or collectively join

473
00:31:53,918 --> 00:31:56,503
and avail the scheme

474
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:58,914
and build houses.

475
00:31:59,814 --> 00:32:00,814
You must have heard about it.

476
00:32:00,903 --> 00:32:02,317
The Government is coming forward
to build houses for us.

477
00:32:02,515 --> 00:32:04,174
We must utilize it.

478
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,522
In some villages the Village President
is coming forward to do this.

479
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,223
You know the fate
of our village.

480
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,326
So we are coming forward
to build it ourselves.

481
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:13,970
It's a good scheme Chinnarasu.

482
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:18,208
But if the Government has the
real intention of uplifting us

483
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,389
They will give us the
sum of money in advance

484
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:21,608
and let us built it.

485
00:32:21,725 --> 00:32:23,950
If they give us the
money in advance,

486
00:32:24,141 --> 00:32:25,859
with our poverty and crisis we
might spend it for something else.

487
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:27,528
This could be the views
of the Government.

488
00:32:28,374 --> 00:32:29,904
If you ask us for
RS 25,000 suddenly

489
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,185
how can we manage?

490
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,907
Can't you take a loan
from the society group?

491
00:32:33,315 --> 00:32:35,065
Who will trust us and give loan?

492
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:38,329
Here's an old proverb that says the
God will shower breaking the roof

493
00:32:38,693 --> 00:32:41,280
We are the ones with no roof over
our head so who will give us?

494
00:32:41,743 --> 00:32:43,407
For her marriage

495
00:32:43,956 --> 00:32:45,392
I saved..

496
00:32:46,445 --> 00:32:48,377
RS 8700 in the society.

497
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:49,919
That's all that I have.

498
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:53,866
When it rains the
house leaks all over.

499
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,608
Somehow I will manage
to get the money,

500
00:32:56,776 --> 00:32:58,220
please help me build the house.

501
00:32:58,397 --> 00:33:00,046
I am delighted.

502
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:02,534
as my daughter comes I
will tell her about this.

503
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:05,169
These unreasonable people
have stopped the bus service.

504
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:06,484
It's dark by the time
the girl reaches home.

505
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:11,916
My heart is pounding until
she reaches home safe.

506
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:15,470
It's time for her delivery.

507
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:19,328
I have asked for the bullock
cart, he told he will spare it.

508
00:33:19,353 --> 00:33:20,568
I am going there to fetch it

509
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:23,052
How can you take a woman in
labour on the bullock cart?

510
00:33:23,077 --> 00:33:24,774
What to do? They have
stopped the bus service

511
00:33:25,027 --> 00:33:28,067
We just have to lamenting.

512
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,054
Rest the housing plan,

513
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,218
the children are struggling
without the bus.

514
00:33:32,461 --> 00:33:35,363
Every day there need to walk 9
miles one way to go to school.

515
00:33:35,692 --> 00:33:37,756
First help us with that.

516
00:33:42,742 --> 00:33:43,742
Brother, tea.

517
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:50,151
The have stopped the
bus deliberately.

518
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,405
We can give a
petition to the RTO.

519
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:55,568
If they are unaware
we can do it,

520
00:33:55,694 --> 00:33:57,537
they are totally aware of it.

521
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:00,224
The RTO will say that
he'll look into it.

522
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,510
Nothing will come of it

523
00:34:04,068 --> 00:34:05,920
Why can't we buy an old bus?

524
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:06,686
How?

525
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,399
Let's seek help from
all whom we know.

526
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,288
Our relatives, those who
have settled in the city

527
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,735
Those in Government jobs..

528
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:16,238
Some of your friends..

529
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:20,190
Through Kittu we can reach
out to some students

530
00:34:20,215 --> 00:34:22,378
If there is some shortfall

531
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:23,559
I will fill it for you.

532
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:24,837
Thank you so much.

533
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:27,353
Write is as RS 51 from
pest control shop

534
00:34:30,324 --> 00:34:31,324
Thanks.

535
00:34:32,557 --> 00:34:34,919
How much? - Write is as Rs. 21

536
00:34:35,327 --> 00:34:36,264
Thanks.

Here - Thanks. Do it well.

538
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,682
Thanks.

539
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:49,252
That's all you have? - Yes.

540
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:52,393
Don't give me the change,
give me the notes

541
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:54,496
After giving you
everything what will I do?

542
00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:57,228
Forget about bus, with this
money you can buy a ticket.

543
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:04,671
It's after a long time that
we have all come together.

544
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:06,067
I feel very happy.

545
00:35:06,362 --> 00:35:10,518
Next we should all go like this for
the Principal's daughter's wedding.

546
00:35:11,863 --> 00:35:13,957
Let's tell everyone
when we leave.

547
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,091
Those interested will join.

548
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:16,815
Kittu

549
00:35:17,971 --> 00:35:18,971
One minute.

550
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:23,523
Sorry.

551
00:35:23,979 --> 00:35:26,497
I didn't expect my uncle
to behave like this.

552
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:28,671
It's alright.

553
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:30,343
Also..

554
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,562
I am in love with you

555
00:35:32,587 --> 00:35:34,257
and will only marry you.

556
00:35:34,744 --> 00:35:36,362
Gomathi!

557
00:35:36,387 --> 00:35:38,370
Rani wanted to say
this to Subash.

558
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,663
My heart stealer tell
me what you want

559
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:15,886
I will give you my heart.

560
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:21,691
Looking at you I
feel like conquering

561
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:26,222
Just consent and it shall do.

562
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:31,365
Just a gentle touch

563
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:36,165
and I will surrender fully.

564
00:36:37,682 --> 00:36:42,012
Without coming near
me you husk me

565
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:46,983
My heart stealer tell
me what you want

566
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:51,130
I will give you my heart.

567
00:36:52,785 --> 00:36:56,486
Looking at you I feel
like conquering.

568
00:36:57,858 --> 00:37:01,929
Just consent and it shall do.

569
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:27,971
I like you a lot. Listen to me.

570
00:37:28,662 --> 00:37:31,213
As I wake up and think of you

571
00:37:31,238 --> 00:37:33,830
My legs go in search of you.

572
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:38,359
Like the minced meat
why do you Engulf me?

573
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:42,987
Like rain drops on the haystack
Why do you stay that way?

574
00:37:43,243 --> 00:37:47,726
Like the crow that
encircles the dried fish

575
00:37:48,418 --> 00:37:53,385
My life revolves around you

576
00:37:53,455 --> 00:37:57,919
Take me as your eternal love.

577
00:37:58,495 --> 00:38:02,160
My heart stealer tell
me what you want

578
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:06,997
I will give you my heart.

579
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:44,411
Every day and night I
see you within me.

580
00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:49,491
As I grind I want you to embrace
And kiss me on my forehead.

581
00:38:49,516 --> 00:38:51,996
Without sleeping on the bed

582
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:54,170
Show me your charm.

583
00:38:54,596 --> 00:38:59,119
I will hold you Till the
lines on my palm fade.

584
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:04,003
It's for you that

585
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:08,636
I feed myself with spices.

586
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:13,963
Spread the plantain leaf.. Sprinkle
it with water and keep it ready.

587
00:39:14,315 --> 00:39:19,065
My heart stealer tell
me what you want

588
00:39:19,365 --> 00:39:22,830
I will give you my heart.

589
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,167
Just a gentle touch

590
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:33,577
and I will surrender fully.

591
00:39:34,514 --> 00:39:38,910
Without coming near
me you husk me

592
00:39:39,573 --> 00:39:41,213
My heart stealer..

593
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:46,502
I will give..

594
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:51,067
My heart stealer..

595
00:40:05,953 --> 00:40:07,332
Is it clear now?

596
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:16,452
The glass looks great.

597
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,607
Really?
- Yes.

598
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:22,415
You look like actor Bhagyaraj
- Really?

599
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:25,923
What have you named the new bus?

600
00:40:25,948 --> 00:40:28,221
We have named it
after Kalimuthu Sir!

601
00:40:52,302 --> 00:40:54,547
Fast.
Go.

602
00:40:54,613 --> 00:40:56,819
Hey.
Why are you leaving me?

603
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:57,922
Move, Kittu.

604
00:41:01,486 --> 00:41:02,653
Stop.

605
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:07,252
Now that we have a new bus, we
don't have to walk so much

606
00:41:07,644 --> 00:41:08,644
Get in.

607
00:41:10,498 --> 00:41:11,498
Get in.

608
00:41:13,188 --> 00:41:14,094
Fast.

609
00:41:15,325 --> 00:41:16,242
Look.

610
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:29,535
Kalimuthu Sir Chariot!

611
00:41:31,007 --> 00:41:33,793
These boys used to
pee on their pants

612
00:41:33,818 --> 00:41:36,015
Just see how they
have transformed.

613
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:38,361
It's because of Kamaraj leader.

614
00:41:38,467 --> 00:41:40,861
Giving them education has
made us a pack of fools.

615
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:46,398
These guys used to come
home begging for meals.

616
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,350
Now they have their own
bus transportation

617
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:52,103
What bus? What's the big deal?

618
00:41:52,158 --> 00:41:56,237
If you paint some tin
sheets is it a bus?

619
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:58,634
Whether it's a tin
sheets or a luxury bus..

620
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:00,221
They have a bus of their own now.

621
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:07,603
That Chinnarasu is like a stone on a
plate of rice.. disturbing us constantly.

622
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:11,908
We should have killed him when
we wanted to take the corpse.

623
00:42:12,406 --> 00:42:13,900
It's still not too late.

624
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:19,403
If we do something now

625
00:42:19,826 --> 00:42:21,489
they will call it anguish.

626
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,372
Let's wait for sometime

627
00:42:23,652 --> 00:42:24,954
and plan a mass destruction.

628
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:39,473
It's only an engagement.

629
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:42,108
Don't worry we will
take care of it.

630
00:42:42,304 --> 00:42:44,363
Listen to me.
Don't cry.

631
00:42:56,459 --> 00:42:59,635
In world history the role
of Hitler is very important.

632
00:42:59,668 --> 00:43:00,823
Madam, one minute please.

633
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,947
Please call Krishnakumar.

634
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:04,753
The Principal wants to meet him.

635
00:43:05,407 --> 00:43:06,407
Krishnakumar.

636
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:07,806
Madam
- Go please.

637
00:43:08,093 --> 00:43:10,093
Why suddenly?
- I don't know.

638
00:43:10,209 --> 00:43:11,509
Why is the police there?

639
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,659
What's this?
- Krishnakumar.

640
00:43:14,977 --> 00:43:17,058
You're probably the best
student in this college.

641
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:19,335
If you do like this?
- What did I do?

642
00:43:49,285 --> 00:43:50,912
Where's Rani?

643
00:43:51,366 --> 00:43:52,366
I don't know.

644
00:43:54,202 --> 00:43:58,202
If you don't tell me
I will just strangle you to death now.

645
00:43:58,474 --> 00:43:59,474
Selvaraj.

646
00:44:06,994 --> 00:44:07,994
Take your hands off.

647
00:44:08,908 --> 00:44:10,241
Take your hands off.

648
00:44:15,341 --> 00:44:16,874
Why are you doing this?

649
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:19,215
He has kidnapped the
girl studying with him.

650
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,761
The girl's has
lodged a complaint.

651
00:44:21,886 --> 00:44:23,219
We haven't kidnapped.

652
00:44:23,407 --> 00:44:25,504
She didn't like the groom they
have fixed by her parents

653
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:27,223
She married Subash.

654
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:31,327
Your Collector has
solemnised the wedding.

655
00:44:31,452 --> 00:44:33,672
It's because of rogues like
him that we have crimes.

656
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:35,264
What's the crime?

657
00:44:35,555 --> 00:44:39,367
Is it a crime that the law permits
two adults to marry those they like?

658
00:44:39,614 --> 00:44:43,338
Or is the right to seek
their partner a crime?

659
00:44:44,527 --> 00:44:45,527
What's the mistake here?

660
00:44:45,692 --> 00:44:48,776
Half baked idiots like you
appear for everything.

661
00:44:48,881 --> 00:44:49,881
That's the mistake!

662
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,970
Because you have power
and using it for gains

663
00:44:52,995 --> 00:44:54,203
Are you half baked or is it us?

664
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,866
For you all those in
Authority are all incorrect.

665
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,194
We don't detest those in Authority

666
00:45:00,222 --> 00:45:02,116
We detest Authority.

667
00:45:02,141 --> 00:45:05,038
It's 4 days since we
saw our daughter.

668
00:45:05,063 --> 00:45:07,556
We don't know if our
daughter is alive.

669
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,775
If you want I will
withdraw my complaint.

670
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,105
Please ask them to
show me my daughter.

671
00:45:18,628 --> 00:45:21,580
Bring that girl and Subash
to the printing press.

672
00:45:21,647 --> 00:45:23,419
Here's the key.
- Okay.

673
00:45:23,705 --> 00:45:26,124
Only the girl's parents come with me
Rest of you stay here.

674
00:45:36,431 --> 00:45:37,890
It has become such a big issue.

675
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,991
I can pay whatever they want.

676
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,897
Ask them to leave my daughter.

677
00:45:44,982 --> 00:45:46,382
Keep the cash inside.

678
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:48,329
My daughter does
not know anything.

679
00:45:48,426 --> 00:45:50,798
The have mesmerised her and
cheated her and taken her away.

680
00:45:50,823 --> 00:45:52,196
.Please keep the
cash inside first

681
00:45:52,331 --> 00:45:53,647
No one can mesmerise anyone here.

682
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,429
She was probably afraid to
tell you she was in love

683
00:45:57,862 --> 00:45:59,907
Don't use terms such
as cheating for that.

684
00:46:00,229 --> 00:46:03,444
Saying that they were
mesmerised and taken away is

685
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,605
Degrading our own children.

686
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,661
You think our
children are so weak?

687
00:46:09,705 --> 00:46:12,195
Even if her father
agree, relatives won't.

688
00:46:12,623 --> 00:46:13,608
Subash is here.

689
00:46:31,271 --> 00:46:33,357
My dear! Where did you go?

690
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:43,464
Subash her father
wants to talk to her.

691
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,779
Let her go
- No need brother.

692
00:46:45,968 --> 00:46:48,131
Her father might say something
and change her mind.

693
00:46:48,297 --> 00:46:50,708
If that girl really loves you

694
00:46:50,827 --> 00:46:53,287
Even if the whole world is
against her she won't leave you.

695
00:46:55,498 --> 00:46:56,958
He's your father.

696
00:46:57,036 --> 00:47:00,009
He has brought you up for 20 years
and been through your good and bad.

697
00:47:00,482 --> 00:47:03,345
Don't hurt him even if
he's angry with you.

698
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,560
Go.

699
00:47:35,828 --> 00:47:36,828
What is this?

700
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,296
Why have you done this?

701
00:47:39,904 --> 00:47:43,465
If you didn't like that groom,
you should told me then.

702
00:47:43,581 --> 00:47:47,781
No, since he's from a different clan

703
00:47:48,389 --> 00:47:50,492
I thought you won't agree.

704
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:52,809
What do you mean!

705
00:47:53,465 --> 00:47:58,351
How can I go back to our clan
and participate in our rituals?

706
00:47:58,688 --> 00:48:01,380
Did you think of your sister
who is married there?

707
00:48:01,405 --> 00:48:02,802
Do you know all that
she has to go through?

708
00:48:04,154 --> 00:48:05,154
You...

709
00:48:06,621 --> 00:48:08,173
Forgive me, father.

710
00:48:09,623 --> 00:48:11,964
Even now I can't believe it.

711
00:48:13,063 --> 00:48:15,611
My daughter has broken the norms.

712
00:48:48,363 --> 00:48:49,563
Hey what happened?

713
00:48:49,766 --> 00:48:50,766
What's that?

714
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,830
(screaming and loud crying)

715
00:48:57,187 --> 00:48:58,200
Rani.

716
00:49:28,338 --> 00:49:30,762
You are gone!

717
00:49:32,132 --> 00:49:33,435
It's all gone!

718
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:37,167
It's all gone!

719
00:49:48,623 --> 00:49:49,623
Leave me.

720
00:49:50,281 --> 00:49:52,316
Brother! She's dead, she's gone,

721
00:49:53,498 --> 00:49:54,635
Rani!

722
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:56,491
You left me alone!

723
00:49:57,641 --> 00:49:59,387
AFTER SOME DAYS

724
00:50:17,465 --> 00:50:19,285
Kumar.
- What Gomathi?

725
00:50:19,713 --> 00:50:21,412
How's Subash?

726
00:50:22,597 --> 00:50:24,330
He looks like he's insane.

727
00:50:24,635 --> 00:50:26,557
He tried killing himself twice.

728
00:50:27,513 --> 00:50:28,513
We saved him.

729
00:50:29,765 --> 00:50:32,185
His mother thought he will
really go insane if he's here

730
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,388
So they took him to his
aunt's house in another place.

731
00:50:59,606 --> 00:51:01,476
What document?
- It's that of the farm.

732
00:51:04,224 --> 00:51:05,877
I have got it with my wife's consent.

733
00:51:05,986 --> 00:51:07,319
Don't worry
- Hello

734
00:51:07,457 --> 00:51:09,177
Hello, is Kittu there?

735
00:51:09,502 --> 00:51:10,502
Yes.

736
00:51:11,795 --> 00:51:14,139
Kittu, there's a call for you.

737
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,135
At this time?

738
00:51:22,689 --> 00:51:25,327
Who is it?
- Gomathi here.

739
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:28,948
When you receive money from the
Government, you are going to repay it.

740
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:31,154
Use it till then.

741
00:51:31,179 --> 00:51:32,179
Yes..

742
00:51:33,402 --> 00:51:36,381
Can you come to college
around 8 tomorrow?

743
00:51:37,989 --> 00:51:40,232
I want to talk to you in private.

744
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,280
I will come.

745
00:52:12,314 --> 00:52:14,093
You know why I called you.

746
00:52:19,424 --> 00:52:21,917
I don't know how I can
make you understand.

747
00:52:24,317 --> 00:52:26,017
I need to become a collector first.

748
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,545
I need to do a lot
for these people.

749
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,469
Just as how Chinnarasu brother
helped me with education

750
00:52:29,774 --> 00:52:31,661
I need to educate several others.

751
00:52:31,856 --> 00:52:32,777
My sister's wedding,

752
00:52:32,802 --> 00:52:34,247
a house for my mother,
jobs for my friends.

753
00:52:35,013 --> 00:52:37,194
I have planned my life in
a different way, Gomathi.

754
00:52:38,483 --> 00:52:40,441
It will be long way
before I can get married.

755
00:52:41,646 --> 00:52:42,646
It's alright.

756
00:52:45,489 --> 00:52:47,143
You want to have the
same fate as Rani?

757
00:52:50,072 --> 00:52:51,072
Kittu

758
00:52:51,507 --> 00:52:53,024
I am mad about you.

759
00:52:54,294 --> 00:52:55,574
Don't try to change me.

760
00:52:56,668 --> 00:52:59,068
Listen, your father
has helped us a lot.

761
00:52:59,322 --> 00:53:01,421
He's continuing to help us.

762
00:53:02,181 --> 00:53:04,709
Gomathi is like betraying his trust.

763
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:06,267
Try and understand.

764
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:08,808
My father will definitely agree.

765
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,046
He likes you a lot.

766
00:53:11,071 --> 00:53:12,757
Gomathi! Why don't you
understand my situation!

767
00:53:18,027 --> 00:53:19,765
You like me, don't you?

768
00:53:21,094 --> 00:53:22,094
I can't Gomathi.

769
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:27,375
I can wait till you are ready.

770
00:53:29,523 --> 00:53:31,216
Don't give me No for an answer.

771
00:53:33,656 --> 00:53:34,935
I will die.

772
00:53:48,298 --> 00:53:50,282
I can't forget you.

773
00:53:53,927 --> 00:53:54,927
Gomathi.

774
00:54:31,512 --> 00:54:32,512
Take this.

775
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,565
Look!

776
00:54:39,324 --> 00:54:40,805
If you want me to get married
to you, be direct about it.

777
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:43,446
Don't come up with
some false tales.

778
00:54:44,662 --> 00:54:47,003
If you do this, then even if my parents
agree I won't settle down with you.

779
00:54:47,098 --> 00:54:49,146
He's not able to live with your sister,

780
00:54:49,512 --> 00:54:50,964
you want me send my other
daughter to that hell?

781
00:54:51,212 --> 00:54:53,402
I am not here to seek
your daughter's hand.

782
00:54:54,279 --> 00:54:56,454
I here to warn you that your
daughter is going astray.

783
00:54:57,078 --> 00:54:59,349
He's from the lower clan.

784
00:54:59,949 --> 00:55:03,540
Your brother doesn't mind a
mistress from the lower clan!

785
00:55:03,961 --> 00:55:06,596
It's three months
since he left her.

786
00:55:07,289 --> 00:55:11,600
The elders in the family want to
talk to you about it this Sunday.

787
00:55:11,883 --> 00:55:13,458
I am not coming anywhere
with my daughter.

788
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:14,813
No one needs to talk
to me about it.

789
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:16,127
Come.
- You leave.

790
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:18,152
No it's a girl.

791
00:55:18,492 --> 00:55:20,291
For me I respect my daughters.

792
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,844
I won't listen to those
like you who mince words.

793
00:55:23,184 --> 00:55:24,502
Tell you brother

794
00:55:24,527 --> 00:55:26,366
To at least live well
with his mistress.

795
00:55:26,716 --> 00:55:27,716
Please leave.

796
00:55:48,058 --> 00:55:49,673
They started with the crematorium

797
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:52,533
and then it's bus,
education, competition..

798
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:54,263
and now they have
come up to the bed.

799
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,774
If we let them live

800
00:55:57,001 --> 00:55:58,280
we will have to go.

801
00:55:58,653 --> 00:56:01,076
It's because of Chinnarasu that
they are so overt in their moves.

802
00:56:01,986 --> 00:56:03,511
We should not touch Chinnarasu

803
00:56:03,976 --> 00:56:05,396
but he should be
reduced to nothing.

804
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:07,060
What are you saying?

805
00:56:07,085 --> 00:56:09,363
State first student, Collector Kittu.

806
00:56:10,294 --> 00:56:11,606
He's the pride of the village?

807
00:56:28,061 --> 00:56:32,363
Forgive me for twisting
things in front of uncle

808
00:56:40,628 --> 00:56:42,901
Tomorrow everyone should
come here by 6.

809
00:56:42,992 --> 00:56:44,119
Definitely.

810
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:52,199
Tomorrow bring your wife
to sign for the witness.

811
00:56:53,188 --> 00:56:54,736
I'll leave.
- Kittu!

812
00:56:54,879 --> 00:56:56,100
Let me drop you.

813
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,030
Sure, Chinnarasu.

814
00:56:58,671 --> 00:56:59,671
Let me leave.

815
00:56:59,902 --> 00:57:01,109
Will bring her tomorrow morning.

816
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:12,356
How's your education?

817
00:57:12,906 --> 00:57:13,906
It's going well.

818
00:57:17,864 --> 00:57:19,816
(Chattering)

819
00:57:22,612 --> 00:57:23,918
I will get dropped here.

820
00:57:30,604 --> 00:57:32,347
Fine will see you tomorrow
- Okay.

821
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,953
That's Ramadoss house isn't it?

822
00:57:36,477 --> 00:57:38,164
Yes. - It's his daughter
Malathi's marriage tomorrow

823
00:57:38,243 --> 00:57:40,084
It's his daughter Malathi's
marriage tomorrow.

824
00:57:40,109 --> 00:57:41,109
Yes.

825
00:57:41,855 --> 00:57:43,950
Malathi and Gomathi studied
together until 10th.

826
00:57:44,439 --> 00:57:47,394
This morning as I left she told
she wanted to go for the function.

827
00:57:47,594 --> 00:57:48,794
I forgot about it.

828
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:50,876
Fine will see you in the morning
during the marriage. - Sure.

829
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:52,544
Kittu, one minute.

830
00:57:52,867 --> 00:57:54,348
I brought you here
to talk to you.

831
00:57:55,232 --> 00:57:57,762
I am talking about other things
instead of what I wanted to talk.

832
00:58:00,419 --> 00:58:02,796
My daughter told me
that she loves you

833
00:58:08,174 --> 00:58:11,583
Kittu, there can't be a better
match for my daughter than you.

834
00:58:14,638 --> 00:58:15,771
Fulfill your dreams,

835
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,009
me and my daughter
will wait for you.

836
00:58:18,382 --> 00:58:20,108
I will take leave.

837
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:11,401
Help!

838
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,642
Come

839
00:59:23,013 --> 00:59:24,456
Take the vehicle.

840
00:59:24,855 --> 00:59:27,346
Come soon
Get in.

841
00:59:27,545 --> 00:59:29,376
Move!
Quick!

842
00:59:44,324 --> 00:59:45,324
Brother!

843
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:46,852
It's the postman here.

844
00:59:47,155 --> 00:59:48,962
Someone has hacked Subramani
brother to death.

845
00:59:49,095 --> 00:59:51,727
What?
Yes, he's dead.

846
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,712
Please rush to the hospital.

847
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,886
Chinnarasu stop here
You can't go in.

848
01:00:06,108 --> 01:00:06,994
I want to see him.

849
01:00:07,151 --> 01:00:09,340
I have information that
your men are behind this.

850
01:00:09,668 --> 01:00:11,296
Subramani was murdered
in your area.

851
01:00:11,597 --> 01:00:13,362
His people are very angry.

852
01:00:13,607 --> 01:00:15,048
You better ask your
people to surrender.

853
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:18,673
What's the proof that
our people did this? - Brother!

854
01:00:18,796 --> 01:00:21,248
Brother! They have burnt our bus
down on the village outskirts.

855
01:00:21,408 --> 01:00:23,968
Four of our people are battling for life.

856
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:41,452
Hey stop!

857
01:01:42,151 --> 01:01:44,663
What are you doing?
- Listen.

858
01:01:46,432 --> 01:01:49,866
Selvaraj, why are
your arresting them?

859
01:01:50,004 --> 01:01:51,386
You know it Chinnarasu.

860
01:01:52,411 --> 01:01:54,567
Your comrade Subramani
was murdered by them.

861
01:01:54,592 --> 01:01:55,880
We didn't do anything.

862
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,630
Selvaraj.

863
01:01:58,218 --> 01:01:59,679
You are crossing your limits.

864
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:01,151
Get into the vehicle.

865
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:02,269
See what they are doing to us
Hey! Start the vehicle

866
01:02:02,489 --> 01:02:03,889
Get into the vehicle.

867
01:02:10,921 --> 01:02:13,383
Chinnarasu if found guilty..

868
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:14,939
14 years..

869
01:02:16,473 --> 01:02:18,381
Forget the dreams of him

870
01:02:19,833 --> 01:02:21,400
becoming a Collector.

871
01:02:22,593 --> 01:02:23,946
Ramu! Start the vehicle.

872
01:02:54,302 --> 01:02:57,746
CENTRAL JAIL - MADURAI

873
01:03:19,316 --> 01:03:23,435
The 4 accused Kittu,
Logu, Kumar and Pandi

874
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,056
are ordered conditional
bail by this Court.

875
01:03:43,655 --> 01:03:44,655
Brother!

876
01:03:45,506 --> 01:03:49,005
That SI says this case will drag
for at least 10 years.

877
01:03:50,268 --> 01:03:51,268
Is it true?

878
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:58,916
So my dreams of becoming a Collector

879
01:03:59,056 --> 01:04:01,128
Will remain only a dream?

880
01:04:10,477 --> 01:04:12,284
Through you our people
with have better times,

881
01:04:13,884 --> 01:04:14,884
Things will change.

882
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:17,390
What I like about you,

883
01:04:18,434 --> 01:04:20,163
is your confidence and endurance.

884
01:04:21,105 --> 01:04:22,849
Under no circumstances
let go of that.

885
01:04:26,179 --> 01:04:26,953
Kittu!

886
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:28,713
Even if the law and
authority is common..

887
01:04:29,534 --> 01:04:31,466
They use in their favor.

888
01:04:32,104 --> 01:04:35,423
We don't have the backing a big
politician or political party.

889
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:37,830
Our people..

890
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:40,071
don't have the strength
to stand up together.

891
01:04:40,836 --> 01:04:41,836
We only have..

892
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:43,969
truth and dreams with us.

893
01:04:46,165 --> 01:04:49,453
They have been fed this poison
of caste for several years.

894
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:51,862
To negate this venom..

895
01:04:52,011 --> 01:04:53,981
several people have struggled
and given their lives.

896
01:04:55,239 --> 01:04:56,522
It's through their death..

897
01:04:57,238 --> 01:04:59,156
that you and I have
emerged to question them.

898
01:05:02,574 --> 01:05:04,180
Those who were only listening...

899
01:05:04,872 --> 01:05:05,872
are now questioning.

900
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:09,140
It's not acceptable for them.

901
01:05:11,264 --> 01:05:12,693
Other than the right to vote...

902
01:05:13,529 --> 01:05:14,980
We have no other rights

903
01:05:15,472 --> 01:05:16,486
for our existence
in this country.

904
01:05:18,849 --> 01:05:20,359
Those who are hitting,
are continuing with it.

905
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:22,190
If we hit back,

906
01:05:23,942 --> 01:05:24,942
they call it audacity.

907
01:05:34,444 --> 01:05:35,444
The evil eyes of the people..

908
01:05:36,001 --> 01:05:37,001
The evil eyes of the strangers..

909
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:39,699
All the evil eyes around...

910
01:05:39,808 --> 01:05:42,544
Let all these get away from you.

911
01:05:42,999 --> 01:05:43,999
Spit it up.

912
01:05:45,684 --> 01:05:48,501
Let all the evil spell
get away from today.

913
01:05:49,993 --> 01:05:51,956
I need to lodge a complaint.

914
01:05:51,985 --> 01:05:54,140
Should we sign even in the evening?

915
01:05:54,573 --> 01:05:56,821
Yes, both morning and evening.

916
01:05:57,976 --> 01:05:58,976
Sign here.

917
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:01,873
Where should I sign?

918
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:02,854
Collector Sir!

919
01:06:03,098 --> 01:06:04,098
One minute.

920
01:06:05,218 --> 01:06:06,865
Satish that's the file
for pickpocket cases.

921
01:06:07,365 --> 01:06:08,732
They are murderers.

922
01:06:11,003 --> 01:06:13,455
What are you staring for?
Want to go in again?

923
01:06:13,696 --> 01:06:14,696
Sign and get out.

924
01:06:15,136 --> 01:06:17,036
Change the file and get it signed
- Okay, sir.

925
01:06:18,845 --> 01:06:21,186
Just sign.

926
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:22,325
Let's leave.

927
01:06:24,353 --> 01:06:25,353
Sign here.

928
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:37,749
It's difficult.

929
01:06:38,269 --> 01:06:39,526
But what can we do?

930
01:06:44,345 --> 01:06:46,196
Sivagami.
Gomathi didn't come?

931
01:06:46,405 --> 01:06:49,517
They stopped her from college.

932
01:07:08,698 --> 01:07:10,250
Without committing any mistakes..

933
01:07:10,275 --> 01:07:11,275
our lives are ruined.

934
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,573
The SI has deliberately
pulled us into this case.

935
01:07:28,179 --> 01:07:30,291
We need to do something.

936
01:07:32,675 --> 01:07:34,075
Let's do something.

937
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:37,679
Really.

938
01:07:46,494 --> 01:07:50,248
In our harsh!
One single hit..

939
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:53,288
We will bury you dead!

940
01:07:54,015 --> 01:07:57,772
You will plead endlessly..

941
01:07:57,906 --> 01:08:01,171
We will continue to pin you down..

942
01:08:01,695 --> 01:08:05,166
We will cover your eyes!
Will chop your legs..

943
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:08,862
We will continue to torture you.

944
01:08:09,144 --> 01:08:12,700
We will come in front of you
Pulp your face..

945
01:08:13,017 --> 01:08:16,594
We will hunt you
down till the end.

946
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:20,467
We will make you repent
Will burn you..

947
01:08:20,542 --> 01:08:23,462
And will finish eating you.

948
01:08:24,249 --> 01:08:28,130
Will count
Every single bone..

949
01:08:28,155 --> 01:08:31,251
Will hang them
and break them to pieces..

950
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,635
Will break your teeth
Will spare no effort to make you teeth less..

951
01:08:35,746 --> 01:08:39,010
Will punch you hard
Till you tame down.

952
01:08:39,523 --> 01:08:42,950
You can take back..
everything with interest.

953
01:08:43,191 --> 01:08:47,168
We will rise and give
what we have to give back.

954
01:09:02,395 --> 01:09:04,299
We should discard you
like a trash cloth.

955
01:09:04,324 --> 01:09:06,046
Should burn you
like a log of wood.

956
01:09:06,114 --> 01:09:07,781
Should shoot you in the
middle of the road.

957
01:09:07,806 --> 01:09:09,529
You should just rot.

958
01:09:09,661 --> 01:09:12,757
Your tail shouldn't wag..
Shut up, shut up.

959
01:09:13,511 --> 01:09:16,557
Don't show your strength..
Run, run away..

960
01:09:17,266 --> 01:09:19,019
Join in clusters.
Get together and..

961
01:09:19,144 --> 01:09:21,023
Wade the evil of caste..

962
01:09:21,048 --> 01:09:22,794
Just remove the bigwigs..

963
01:09:22,819 --> 01:09:24,759
Let's this place Prosper.

964
01:09:24,817 --> 01:09:26,675
With this violence
the creepers and climbers.

965
01:09:26,751 --> 01:09:28,936
will not wilt..
You can't you can't.

966
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:29,961
Run away.

967
01:09:30,051 --> 01:09:31,392
He has a gun.

968
01:10:04,272 --> 01:10:05,548
Why is he hitting him so much?

969
01:10:05,573 --> 01:10:07,902
What if he dies?
- He does not listen to us.

970
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:38,817
Sir, please stop.

971
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:40,618
What will be do if he dies?

972
01:10:40,643 --> 01:10:42,010
Let him die.

973
01:11:13,774 --> 01:11:14,558
Sir!

974
01:11:15,564 --> 01:11:17,630
What?
- Our region postman has come.

975
01:11:21,502 --> 01:11:22,502
Greetings, Sir!

976
01:11:22,749 --> 01:11:23,777
What are you doing at this time?

977
01:11:23,802 --> 01:11:26,627
I know this lady, wanted
to take her husband.

978
01:11:34,691 --> 01:11:35,758
You have to come and pay
the fine tomorrow morning.

979
01:11:35,783 --> 01:11:36,783
Do you understand?
- Got it.

980
01:11:37,621 --> 01:11:38,336
Take him.

981
01:11:38,703 --> 01:11:41,557
Thanks, sir.
- Get lost.

982
01:11:44,006 --> 01:11:45,359
Come in the morning.
Got it?

983
01:12:06,093 --> 01:12:08,009
Mom, brother would have
slept at the Press.

984
01:12:08,165 --> 01:12:09,486
Don't be scared, he will be back.

985
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:54,033
Selvaraj, why did you
arrest Kittu last night?

986
01:12:54,847 --> 01:12:55,847
No!

987
01:12:56,629 --> 01:12:57,629
I didn't arrest
anyone like that.

988
01:13:07,904 --> 01:13:09,904
Yes I arrested.

989
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,440
I hit him.

990
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:15,858
How dare he!
Tried assaulting me?

991
01:13:19,897 --> 01:13:21,832
He was spared because
this man came.

992
01:13:21,857 --> 01:13:22,857
Else would have
beaten him to death.

993
01:13:24,008 --> 01:13:25,008
Where's Kittu now?

994
01:13:25,549 --> 01:13:27,051
Let him out at 6 AM.

995
01:13:27,327 --> 01:13:28,327
He has still not come home.

996
01:13:29,409 --> 01:13:30,738
Try searching for him in some hospital.

997
01:13:34,566 --> 01:13:35,566
Will see.

998
01:14:04,657 --> 01:14:07,405
He went to the station to
sign last evening at 6.

999
01:14:07,504 --> 01:14:09,519
Till this evening he has not come home
What does that mean?

1000
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:13,083
From the time he scored the state
first they are eyeing him.

1001
01:14:13,318 --> 01:14:16,894
That's why they framed false charges
on him and sent him to jail.

1002
01:14:18,765 --> 01:14:21,562
Chinnarasu, what if
something happened to Kittu

1003
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,345
in the lockup With the
SI hitting him so much.

1004
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:27,379
What are they saying..?

1005
01:14:27,482 --> 01:14:28,482
It's possible.

1006
01:14:28,842 --> 01:14:30,307
In another village..

1007
01:14:30,384 --> 01:14:34,697
they did something to one man
then claimed that he's absconding.

1008
01:14:34,911 --> 01:14:36,873
Don't be idiotic.
- What's all this?

1009
01:14:36,898 --> 01:14:38,445
I am very scared.

1010
01:14:38,736 --> 01:14:41,140
What happened to my son?
- Don't be scared.

1011
01:14:42,076 --> 01:14:44,536
Kittu will come
- Nothing would have happened.

1012
01:14:44,561 --> 01:14:47,979
That SI is trying to
threaten us through Kittu.

1013
01:14:48,339 --> 01:14:49,674
Nothing would have happened

1014
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:51,625
Don't be scared.
Don't cry.

1015
01:14:54,366 --> 01:14:55,958
We should not be
quite beyond this.

1016
01:15:09,029 --> 01:15:10,505
Mani, what?

1017
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:12,996
Chinnarasu brother wanted
me to pass on a message.

1018
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:15,917
SI Selvaraj had taken Kittu
to the station and beat him.

1019
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:17,924
This unscrupulous man.
He should not be spared.

1020
01:15:17,999 --> 01:15:20,293
We will come.
Let's see if it's them or us tomorrow.

1021
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,443
Bring your parents as well.

1022
01:15:22,468 --> 01:15:23,331
What time should we come?

1023
01:15:23,545 --> 01:15:25,039
Come to the station
before it dawns.

1024
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:50,112
Hello.

1025
01:15:50,137 --> 01:15:51,630
Sir, this is Constable Satish.

1026
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:54,645
Chinnarasu has gathered several of his
people and sitting infront of the station.

1027
01:15:55,026 --> 01:15:56,495
All of them have a
fuel can with them.

1028
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,993
I don't understand
what they are planning.

1029
01:16:01,561 --> 01:16:02,954
What you're doing is
incorrect Chinnarasu.

1030
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:05,284
It's against the law to
gather this as a mob.

1031
01:16:06,434 --> 01:16:09,609
If there's a complaint against him,
give it in writing. I will take action.

1032
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:11,014
We can talk about it.

1033
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:11,974
Ask them to disperse.

1034
01:16:12,065 --> 01:16:13,295
It's disrupting mobility.

1035
01:16:13,703 --> 01:16:15,161
They will listen to you.

1036
01:16:16,565 --> 01:16:17,565
Hey!

1037
01:16:17,878 --> 01:16:19,583
Better disperse.

1038
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,491
Else will shoot you all.

1039
01:16:21,516 --> 01:16:23,360
Shoot us?
Will you?

1040
01:16:23,385 --> 01:16:24,593
Are you trying to threaten us?

1041
01:16:24,618 --> 01:16:26,126
We will burn you along
with the station.

1042
01:16:26,519 --> 01:16:27,956
If Kittu does not
come back alive..

1043
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:29,356
We won't spare you.

1044
01:16:29,523 --> 01:16:31,144
We are being calm because
of Chinnarasu brother!

1045
01:16:37,554 --> 01:16:38,085
Selvaraj, come here.

1046
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:39,312
Is this how you talk in public?

1047
01:16:40,167 --> 01:16:44,412
The student of the arts college
was taken by the police..

1048
01:16:44,662 --> 01:16:47,431
for under the pretext of
questioning By the SI..

1049
01:16:47,547 --> 01:16:50,283
to the police station the
day before yesterday.

1050
01:16:50,553 --> 01:16:52,460
As the student taken for enquiry..

1051
01:16:52,615 --> 01:16:54,186
did not return until last evening..

1052
01:16:54,344 --> 01:16:57,058
The people of the village have
laid seize to the police station.

1053
01:16:57,099 --> 01:17:00,836
This has completely crippled the
road transport along that route.

1054
01:17:00,877 --> 01:17:04,195
That SI claims that boy came to hit him
so he took him into custody to enquire.

1055
01:17:04,363 --> 01:17:06,047
Around 10 of us can beat the SI..

1056
01:17:06,084 --> 01:17:07,613
and claim that we went to enquire
something. What do you say?

1057
01:17:08,328 --> 01:17:10,619
If some valuables are missing
we can complain to the police

1058
01:17:10,814 --> 01:17:11,814
But what do we do if
a person is missing?

1059
01:17:11,925 --> 01:17:13,933
That's too because of the police!

1060
01:17:15,003 --> 01:17:17,342
Just imagine that Kittu
has murdered Subramani.

1061
01:17:17,367 --> 01:17:19,295
Without enquiring properly..

1062
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,577
How can you claim that
the person is missing?

1063
01:17:22,261 --> 01:17:23,224
Assume that he has
committed a crime..

1064
01:17:23,249 --> 01:17:24,301
Can they kill him for that?

1065
01:17:24,326 --> 01:17:26,730
That policeman should
be shamed in public..

1066
01:17:27,135 --> 01:17:29,516
We should hit with broom sticks.

1067
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:31,613
If we are educated they
will hack us to death..

1068
01:17:31,651 --> 01:17:34,715
Knowing this our forefathers
didn't go to schools.

1069
01:17:35,085 --> 01:17:37,498
Kittu brother is a
very nice person.

1070
01:17:37,759 --> 01:17:40,342
When we ask him some doubts he
always answers it with a smile.

1071
01:17:40,367 --> 01:17:41,895
See what they have done to him.

1072
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,504
If my son commits a mistake..

1073
01:17:43,714 --> 01:17:44,939
I ask him to take
Kittu as a role model.

1074
01:17:45,106 --> 01:17:46,833
I want my son to be like him.

1075
01:17:46,858 --> 01:17:49,969
See what they have done
to a boy like that.

1076
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:52,237
The SI will definitely
die a painful death.

1077
01:17:52,398 --> 01:17:54,850
He knows the value of life
and saved that girl Rani.

1078
01:17:55,466 --> 01:17:57,768
For that also they beat him.

1079
01:17:57,793 --> 01:18:01,499
Even if you work tirelessly in their farm
They will only give the frugal remains.

1080
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:04,374
They think endlessly to
give out spoilt food.

1081
01:18:05,366 --> 01:18:07,648
Will they spare us if we seek hot meals?

1082
01:18:08,258 --> 01:18:09,258
Just like this..

1083
01:18:09,738 --> 01:18:11,186
they took my son for an enquiry.

1084
01:18:12,032 --> 01:18:13,646
Till now I don't know
what happened to him.

1085
01:18:15,074 --> 01:18:16,985
We are not after money
and live in poverty.

1086
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:19,671
Now these demons
even want our lives.

1087
01:18:20,689 --> 01:18:24,333
Now you don't respect us after
the Governor rule is imposed.

1088
01:18:25,509 --> 01:18:26,509
Not like that sir.

1089
01:18:27,229 --> 01:18:28,229
That's fine.

1090
01:18:28,508 --> 01:18:30,696
Is that boy really alive or not?

1091
01:18:30,871 --> 01:18:32,435
I am sure they have killed him.

1092
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:33,839
He was bathing the cows..

1093
01:18:34,061 --> 01:18:36,836
he aimed at being the
District Collector.

1094
01:18:36,861 --> 01:18:38,774
So they killed him!

1095
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,797
Greetings!
- Greetings!

1096
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:43,502
I am Nellai Varathan.
- I know you very well.

1097
01:18:43,628 --> 01:18:44,628
I am very happy.

1098
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:50,053
The people who were scattered all
over have united through your speech.

1099
01:18:50,419 --> 01:18:51,976
An educated man like you..

1100
01:18:52,001 --> 01:18:53,333
should head our clan.

1101
01:18:53,831 --> 01:18:55,275
I am behind you.

1102
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,337
Our agitation will succeed.
- Thank you very much.

1103
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:08,013
Hello.

1104
01:19:09,925 --> 01:19:12,375
This is Thangarasu.

1105
01:19:12,455 --> 01:19:13,455
Okay.

1106
01:19:17,268 --> 01:19:19,509
Let me just call him.

1107
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,188
Hello
- This is Vadivel.

1108
01:19:53,534 --> 01:19:54,867
How are you?

1109
01:19:55,225 --> 01:19:56,225
Doing well, brother.

1110
01:19:56,412 --> 01:19:58,461
Brother wants to talk to you.

1111
01:19:58,486 --> 01:19:59,486
Pass it to him.
- Okay.

1112
01:20:40,015 --> 01:20:41,492
Kittu, an idea.

1113
01:20:41,575 --> 01:20:43,445
For you to come out
of this case..

1114
01:20:44,078 --> 01:20:45,078
there's just one way.

1115
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:47,087
What is it?

1116
01:20:47,112 --> 01:20:48,712
To damage us...

1117
01:20:49,269 --> 01:20:50,872
they have used deception
against us several times.

1118
01:20:51,782 --> 01:20:53,100
Once for your benefit..

1119
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:54,992
For the benefit of those
dependent on us..

1120
01:20:56,228 --> 01:20:59,494
Let's use the same
deception just once.

1121
01:21:04,296 --> 01:21:06,476
You are the witness who saw
Kittu being hit by the SI.

1122
01:21:06,575 --> 01:21:07,575
That's all.

1123
01:21:07,853 --> 01:21:09,532
Tomorrow you call the police..

1124
01:21:09,723 --> 01:21:11,298
and inform where the
brewed illicit liquor.

1125
01:21:25,373 --> 01:21:26,530
Brother, how are you?

1126
01:21:26,688 --> 01:21:27,848
I am fine..

1127
01:21:27,873 --> 01:21:29,671
How are you doing ?
- I am fine.

1128
01:21:30,335 --> 01:21:31,335
No problem here.

1129
01:21:32,329 --> 01:21:33,329
Saw the newspaper .

1130
01:21:34,148 --> 01:21:35,361
I am delighted.

1131
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:37,902
Everything is happening
as we planned.

1132
01:21:37,927 --> 01:21:38,927
Not just what we planned..

1133
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:40,465
Things beyond that is happening.

1134
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:42,569
We just set the stage
for an agitation.

1135
01:21:42,755 --> 01:21:44,554
That agitation has
grown enormously..

1136
01:21:44,579 --> 01:21:46,536
and now I am of the faith that our
dreams will soon be a reality.

1137
01:21:47,318 --> 01:21:48,601
Just wait for 5 more days.

1138
01:21:48,873 --> 01:21:50,382
I believe things will
be in our favour.

1139
01:21:51,463 --> 01:21:52,882
Till then you be careful.

1140
01:21:52,907 --> 01:21:54,509
Okay, brother.
Shall I hang up?

1141
01:21:54,534 --> 01:21:55,938
You call me on Saturday.

1142
01:21:56,002 --> 01:21:58,005
I will tell you what should
be our next move. - Okay.

1143
01:22:24,344 --> 01:22:25,344
Hello.

1144
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,540
Hello!

1145
01:22:27,878 --> 01:22:28,878
Hello, who is this?

1146
01:22:30,884 --> 01:22:31,906
Who was it?

1147
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:34,419
Don't know, they just hung up!

1148
01:22:45,075 --> 01:22:45,904
Good morning, Sir.
- Morning.

1149
01:22:45,982 --> 01:22:46,780
What's the status now?

1150
01:22:46,805 --> 01:22:49,564
Sir, they have a strong eye witness who
saw Kittu being beaten up in the station.

1151
01:22:51,082 --> 01:22:52,283
Did you enquire those
in the station?

1152
01:22:52,458 --> 01:22:54,174
I enquired all the constables.

1153
01:22:55,454 --> 01:22:56,778
The SI has released Kittu.

1154
01:22:59,919 --> 01:23:00,672
Chinnarasu, one minute.

1155
01:23:03,914 --> 01:23:06,030
I have also enquired
will all the police here.

1156
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:08,448
The SI had released Kittu.

1157
01:23:08,614 --> 01:23:11,464
Kittu probably got scared with all
the beating and has gone somewhere.

1158
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:13,040
He will definitely come back.

1159
01:23:13,512 --> 01:23:14,539
Sir, excuse us.

1160
01:23:14,564 --> 01:23:16,074
Till we kind Kittu alive..

1161
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:17,408
We will wait.

1162
01:23:17,654 --> 01:23:18,654
Chinnarasu!

1163
01:23:18,931 --> 01:23:21,383
Don't try to become
a leader overnight.

1164
01:23:21,611 --> 01:23:23,514
If your people know
your true colour..

1165
01:23:24,138 --> 01:23:25,456
You will be reduced to nothing.

1166
01:23:25,481 --> 01:23:26,980
Selvaraj!
- Sir!

1167
01:23:29,616 --> 01:23:30,986
'As you point fingers at me..'

1168
01:23:31,245 --> 01:23:34,830
'you might have to fold hands and
talk to me. That time will come.'

1169
01:23:39,896 --> 01:23:42,890
Greetings!
The news is read by Saroj Narayansami.

1170
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:47,501
In connection with the missing youth
of the arts college of Pudhur..

1171
01:23:47,643 --> 01:23:51,209
The SI of that police
station is suspended.

1172
01:23:56,325 --> 01:23:57,325
Brother.

1173
01:23:58,187 --> 01:24:01,688
If I don't find that Kittu and cut in
to pieces and bury him right here..

1174
01:24:03,026 --> 01:24:04,571
I am not born for one father.

1175
01:24:07,017 --> 01:24:08,815
If you don't tell
me where Kittu is..

1176
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,203
I will kill you and
bury you here.

1177
01:24:10,352 --> 01:24:12,340
I really don't know where he is.

1178
01:24:12,836 --> 01:24:13,993
Believe me.

1179
01:24:14,018 --> 01:24:15,995
Pretending?

1180
01:24:16,307 --> 01:24:18,183
You think I am a fool?

1181
01:24:18,549 --> 01:24:19,754
Tell me where's Kittu?

1182
01:24:19,779 --> 01:24:21,849
I swear on my children.
I don't know where he is.

1183
01:24:21,874 --> 01:24:22,874
Leave him.

1184
01:24:23,303 --> 01:24:24,176
He's just the arrow.

1185
01:24:24,324 --> 01:24:25,324
I am telling you, leave him!.

1186
01:24:31,273 --> 01:24:34,748
I will kill that Kittu
who humiliated me.

1187
01:24:36,465 --> 01:24:38,510
It's not vital that
you kill Kittu now.

1188
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:41,629
We can always reduce
him to nothing.

1189
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:46,869
Now we need to prove that the
agitation by Chinnarasu is a mere lie.

1190
01:24:48,422 --> 01:24:51,189
It's only then his own..

1191
01:24:51,356 --> 01:24:53,275
people will turn against him.

1192
01:24:54,148 --> 01:24:56,203
That Chinnarasu should
be humiliated.

1193
01:25:00,163 --> 01:25:01,977
If their agitation succeeds...

1194
01:25:02,341 --> 01:25:04,539
The we all should die in shame.

1195
01:25:06,774 --> 01:25:09,574
Any decision taken by you
in rage will be incorrect.

1196
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:11,020
Don't worry.

1197
01:25:11,285 --> 01:25:12,285
I will take care.

1198
01:25:16,775 --> 01:25:17,984
How do we bring him here?

1199
01:25:18,691 --> 01:25:20,324
This love won't let
them stay idle.

1200
01:25:21,618 --> 01:25:24,201
Wherever he is,
he'll call Gomathi.

1201
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:26,970
Using her as a bait
we should catch him.

1202
01:25:34,334 --> 01:25:35,956
That boy Kittu is a nice boy.

1203
01:25:36,134 --> 01:25:39,009
Only this Chinnarasu motivated
him to do something.

1204
01:25:39,192 --> 01:25:41,588
Isn't there a difference
between anger and rage?

1205
01:25:41,912 --> 01:25:43,870
Heard they sold your farm without
your husband's knowledge.

1206
01:25:44,731 --> 01:25:46,846
No it's in my name...

1207
01:25:47,215 --> 01:25:51,630
he pledged it to help
them build houses.

1208
01:25:55,169 --> 01:25:56,960
Your father has done
so much for them.

1209
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:57,999
Unfaithful people.

1210
01:25:58,173 --> 01:25:59,723
Merciless.

1211
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:02,288
Do you know where that boy Kittu is?

1212
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:06,518
Gomathi, if you know tell us.
We should not spare him

1213
01:26:18,955 --> 01:26:20,203
Pick it up.

1214
01:26:45,651 --> 01:26:46,338
Hello?

1215
01:26:46,842 --> 01:26:48,229
Gomathi ?

1216
01:26:48,443 --> 01:26:50,720
Kittu.
- Talk, find out where he is

1217
01:26:52,693 --> 01:26:53,731
How are you ?

1218
01:26:53,756 --> 01:26:54,756
I am fine.

1219
01:26:54,992 --> 01:26:55,992
I have no problem.

1220
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:57,711
I called to tell you that.

1221
01:26:58,110 --> 01:26:59,110
Ask him where he is?

1222
01:27:00,665 --> 01:27:01,665
Where are you now?

1223
01:27:06,402 --> 01:27:08,765
Kittu, I want to meet you.

1224
01:27:11,989 --> 01:27:14,186
No, I won't tell anyone.

1225
01:27:14,867 --> 01:27:16,809
I think I will go mad
without seeing you.

1226
01:27:28,347 --> 01:27:29,347
Fine.

1227
01:27:30,727 --> 01:27:31,727
I will come tomorrow morning.

1228
01:27:36,038 --> 01:27:37,038
Where is he?

1229
01:27:39,661 --> 01:27:42,368
In a hill station
near Theni , he says.

1230
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:44,641
He is trapped.

1231
01:27:57,945 --> 01:28:01,965
Yesterday, your sister tricked us
saying it's near a hill in Theni.

1232
01:28:03,704 --> 01:28:06,987
Today, the mother and daughter are
tricking us that the girl is missing

1233
01:28:11,465 --> 01:28:12,221
Hey!

1234
01:28:12,442 --> 01:28:14,545
Tell me truth where
she has gone.

1235
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:16,448
Else I won't be a human anymore.

1236
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,332
Why are you panicking now?

1237
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:22,470
We should panic that
my sister is missing.

1238
01:28:25,689 --> 01:28:27,349
We really don't know
where she has gone.

1239
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,520
My dear wife...

1240
01:28:28,916 --> 01:28:30,939
Tell me a convincing lie.

1241
01:28:32,361 --> 01:28:33,723
Why are you staring?

1242
01:28:33,748 --> 01:28:34,738
After all this..

1243
01:28:34,763 --> 01:28:36,196
She's going behind
that murderer?

1244
01:28:36,593 --> 01:28:38,410
We don't know if she has
gone in search of him.

1245
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:42,729
But we know he's not the reason for
my father's death.

1246
01:28:53,252 --> 01:28:55,675
How do you say so?

1247
01:28:59,454 --> 01:29:01,113
You fulfill your
dreams and come.

1248
01:29:01,415 --> 01:29:03,113
Me and my daughter
will wait for you.

1249
01:29:04,101 --> 01:29:05,101
I'll leave.

1250
01:29:43,601 --> 01:29:46,615
Gomathi met Kittu during
her friend's engagement.

1251
01:29:46,774 --> 01:29:48,961
It during that time
when they were talking..

1252
01:29:49,084 --> 01:29:50,244
My father was murdered.

1253
01:29:50,838 --> 01:29:53,042
There's no connection between
Kittu and my father's death.

1254
01:29:56,489 --> 01:29:58,942
She has acted in front of us.

1255
01:29:59,450 --> 01:30:01,175
She has gone in search of him.

1256
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:04,605
KODAIKANAL- PERUMPALLAM

1257
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:22,319
Gomathi, don't cry.

1258
01:30:23,615 --> 01:30:24,883
Gomathi. why are you crying?

1259
01:30:24,908 --> 01:30:26,295
I was so worried..

1260
01:30:26,925 --> 01:30:28,686
that something happened to you.

1261
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:30,248
Nothing happened.

1262
01:30:30,273 --> 01:30:32,170
It's the God that I prayed to..

1263
01:30:32,773 --> 01:30:34,883
that has brought you
in front of me.

1264
01:30:35,686 --> 01:30:36,994
Not your deity..

1265
01:30:37,469 --> 01:30:40,299
Its Chinnarasu brother,
who brought me here.

1266
01:30:54,834 --> 01:30:56,276
You could have told me.

1267
01:30:56,301 --> 01:30:57,629
I was so worried.

1268
01:30:57,973 --> 01:30:58,973
No, Gomathi..

1269
01:30:59,277 --> 01:31:01,047
My mother, sister, friends..

1270
01:31:01,315 --> 01:31:03,973
I was told by Chinnarasu
brother not to tell anyone.

1271
01:31:07,577 --> 01:31:08,577
Where are you staying now?

1272
01:31:09,045 --> 01:31:11,223
With a friend of
Chinnarasu brother.

1273
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,279
Take me with you.

1274
01:31:20,907 --> 01:31:22,526
I won't go back there.

1275
01:31:22,688 --> 01:31:24,577
Gomathi, are you aware of
what you are talking?

1276
01:31:25,401 --> 01:31:26,401
Kittu!

1277
01:31:26,887 --> 01:31:28,355
Every minute I am there..

1278
01:31:28,825 --> 01:31:31,397
I am terrified that they will kill me
Like what they did to my father.

1279
01:31:32,307 --> 01:31:33,934
Please take me with you.

1280
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:57,345
I should come..

1281
01:31:58,582 --> 01:32:02,058
along with you.

1282
01:32:02,528 --> 01:32:06,180
I should seek joy from that.

1283
01:32:06,462 --> 01:32:09,315
I should come..

1284
01:32:10,514 --> 01:32:14,104
As I search, without
realising you should give

1285
01:32:14,546 --> 01:32:18,184
I should be elated with that.

1286
01:32:18,547 --> 01:32:22,318
As I near you day and
night becomes beautiful.

1287
01:32:22,553 --> 01:32:26,228
Learn to love till life melts.
That's all I want.

1288
01:32:26,465 --> 01:32:30,604
I should not be away from you.
Even for a day.

1289
01:32:30,807 --> 01:32:34,581
We will unite.

1290
01:32:34,606 --> 01:32:37,780
I should come with you..

1291
01:32:38,566 --> 01:32:41,824
as your partner.

1292
01:32:42,496 --> 01:32:46,464
Should seek solace from that.

1293
01:33:03,978 --> 01:33:05,531
What that girl says is true.

1294
01:33:05,998 --> 01:33:07,852
It's not safe for her at home.

1295
01:33:08,996 --> 01:33:10,540
Let her be with you.

1296
01:33:10,565 --> 01:33:11,948
Like a tender climber..

1297
01:33:11,993 --> 01:33:18,062
I like to envelop you
in this hill forest.

1298
01:33:18,538 --> 01:33:22,436
Without a glimpse of sorrow..

1299
01:33:22,602 --> 01:33:26,407
I will shield you till
the end of my life.

1300
01:33:26,490 --> 01:33:30,284
Even if the whole place is against me

1301
01:33:30,592 --> 01:33:34,286
I will survive to live with you.

1302
01:33:34,498 --> 01:33:40,443
I your hand I will be
hidden as your palm lines.

1303
01:33:40,546 --> 01:33:42,576
Will forget the whole world.

1304
01:33:42,601 --> 01:33:45,806
I should come with you..

1305
01:34:10,577 --> 01:34:12,984
Till it dawns..

1306
01:34:13,376 --> 01:34:18,376
Will float as the moon
Will shoulder you.

1307
01:34:18,455 --> 01:34:20,081
Even after it dawns..

1308
01:34:20,106 --> 01:34:22,494
Will refuse to leave
as the day dream..

1309
01:34:22,567 --> 01:34:26,409
to hear your stories.

1310
01:34:26,535 --> 01:34:30,027
Even if I scout
for my whole life..

1311
01:34:30,419 --> 01:34:34,485
There is none other
than you for me.

1312
01:34:34,572 --> 01:34:38,330
Don't try to leave my eyes.

1313
01:34:38,469 --> 01:34:42,336
Don't move away from me
My life will be still.

1314
01:34:42,571 --> 01:34:45,506
I should come..

1315
01:34:46,564 --> 01:34:50,040
along with you.

1316
01:34:50,385 --> 01:34:54,037
I should seek joy from that.

1317
01:34:54,533 --> 01:34:58,304
As I near you day and
night becomes beautiful.

1318
01:34:58,368 --> 01:35:02,043
Learn to love till life melts.
That's all I want.

1319
01:35:02,327 --> 01:35:06,466
I should not be away from you.
Even for a day.

1320
01:35:06,583 --> 01:35:10,357
We will unite.

1321
01:35:10,548 --> 01:35:13,722
I should come with you..

1322
01:35:21,196 --> 01:35:23,112
I don't know what you will do.

1323
01:35:23,672 --> 01:35:26,253
Before dusk, not a single person should
be there before the police station.

1324
01:35:26,546 --> 01:35:29,175
Govind, really our boy
didn't do anything right?

1325
01:35:29,476 --> 01:35:30,751
He didn't do anything.

1326
01:35:30,776 --> 01:35:32,736
Alright.
You hang up. I will take care.

1327
01:35:37,498 --> 01:35:39,126
Greetings!
- Greetings!

1328
01:35:39,822 --> 01:35:41,129
Hey, look there.
- What?

1329
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:42,464
See the MLA is here.

1330
01:35:45,509 --> 01:35:48,706
Chinnarasu you should have come to me.

1331
01:35:48,765 --> 01:35:50,070
I heard about it.

1332
01:35:50,633 --> 01:35:52,709
Give your concerns in writing

1333
01:35:53,232 --> 01:35:54,854
I will try to resolve this.

1334
01:35:55,181 --> 01:35:57,075
For that you can gather in public..

1335
01:35:57,530 --> 01:35:58,506
and create an agitation..

1336
01:35:58,974 --> 01:36:00,246
It's against the law and order.

1337
01:36:00,327 --> 01:36:02,288
If the law is in order
why should be protest?

1338
01:36:02,622 --> 01:36:04,046
You are asking it in writing?

1339
01:36:04,071 --> 01:36:05,071
How many times we write?

1340
01:36:05,402 --> 01:36:06,709
We have written petition after petition

1341
01:36:06,814 --> 01:36:08,735
and only left with sore
fingers and dried ink.

1342
01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:11,771
If we gather in groups
it's against the law..

1343
01:36:11,796 --> 01:36:13,420
If we say that the law is

1344
01:36:13,592 --> 01:36:15,584
against us, will you listen?
- Chinnarasu.

1345
01:36:16,321 --> 01:36:18,151
Don't gather a crowd
And don't trigger their emotions.....

1346
01:36:18,486 --> 01:36:20,467
Address your concerns in writing.

1347
01:36:20,492 --> 01:36:21,883
I will pass it to the
Governor and will try..

1348
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:24,787
to have whatever is possible
implemented for you.

1349
01:36:25,645 --> 01:36:28,443
You only say you will do
what's possible for you.

1350
01:36:28,570 --> 01:36:31,212
You are not positive that you can
do something to address our needs

1351
01:36:31,292 --> 01:36:33,192
Don't play with
words, Chinnarasu.

1352
01:36:33,217 --> 01:36:35,016
We can only go by
what records we have.

1353
01:36:35,174 --> 01:36:36,544
Of course, what's on the record.

1354
01:36:36,569 --> 01:36:38,662
Are we asking you to
implement a new law?

1355
01:36:38,687 --> 01:36:40,907
We are asking you to
implement the law properly.

1356
01:36:41,468 --> 01:36:42,954
The concerns that we put forward

1357
01:36:43,358 --> 01:36:45,880
are not against the law
or off the record.

1358
01:36:47,132 --> 01:36:50,195
Our first demand is to
bring Kittu back alive.

1359
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:51,411
They should permanently
relieve Kittu and his friends

1360
01:36:51,436 --> 01:36:53,817
from the false cases
frame against them.

1361
01:36:54,259 --> 01:36:56,056
In our well wisher
Subramani's murder..

1362
01:36:56,568 --> 01:37:00,758
The four real culprits Gunasekar,Ramanathan,
Palaikumar and Srinvasan...

1363
01:37:00,975 --> 01:37:02,491
should be arrested.

1364
01:37:02,752 --> 01:37:03,871
Without any caste bias..

1365
01:37:04,092 --> 01:37:05,237
The dead should be carried..

1366
01:37:05,314 --> 01:37:08,775
on the common path, as
ordered by the Court.

1367
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:12,560
SI Selvaraj who is
constantly working against us

1368
01:37:12,911 --> 01:37:14,434
should be dismissed.

1369
01:37:18,088 --> 01:37:20,440
It's like a provision list.

1370
01:37:20,556 --> 01:37:22,660
They won't listen to us.

1371
01:37:23,019 --> 01:37:24,186
Disperse them using force.

1372
01:37:24,403 --> 01:37:26,563
We can't do that without
Collector's order.

1373
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,153
I am the MLA.

1374
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,349
Just do as I say.

1375
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:32,934
We definitely need the
Collector's order.

1376
01:37:33,263 --> 01:37:33,922
Is it?

1377
01:37:34,166 --> 01:37:36,074
Then ask the Collector immediately.

1378
01:37:37,325 --> 01:37:38,201
Okay, Sir.

1379
01:37:39,052 --> 01:37:39,935
Balaguru (Chief Secretary)

1380
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:40,960
What's happening there?

1381
01:37:41,110 --> 01:37:42,652
We are already have
a President rule.

1382
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,674
In such a situation a boy
is missing in a village

1383
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:46,332
How do we face the
public and the media?

1384
01:37:47,419 --> 01:37:50,093
Actually they are staging a drama.

1385
01:37:50,118 --> 01:37:51,951
I don't think they
are staging a drama.

1386
01:37:52,109 --> 01:37:53,109
I have my doubts on the police.

1387
01:37:53,703 --> 01:37:55,869
I don't know what you will do.
Take immediate action.

1388
01:37:56,421 --> 01:37:58,546
If Home Ministry and Human
Rights commission are involved..

1389
01:37:59,286 --> 01:38:01,286
Then I will have to dismiss you.

1390
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:03,544
Murthy!
- Sir.

1391
01:38:04,054 --> 01:38:06,679
If someone utters the truth
on Kittu's whereabouts..

1392
01:38:07,385 --> 01:38:08,968
This case will be resolved.

1393
01:38:08,993 --> 01:38:09,910
Balu!

1394
01:38:10,002 --> 01:38:11,669
I know you are a
very nice person.

1395
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,538
You are not running after money.

1396
01:38:13,563 --> 01:38:16,605
But for how long will you
Shuttle between the Lower and Higher Courts.

1397
01:38:16,851 --> 01:38:18,184
I will speak to the
Law Minister..

1398
01:38:18,586 --> 01:38:20,461
Will get you the post of
the Public Prosecutor.

1399
01:38:20,931 --> 01:38:21,931
Just one thing.

1400
01:38:22,407 --> 01:38:24,366
Let me know where that Kittu is?

1401
01:38:24,788 --> 01:38:25,788
Hey!
Come here.

1402
01:38:27,388 --> 01:38:29,971
Look!
No one other than us will know about this.

1403
01:38:34,306 --> 01:38:35,306
Take the cash.

1404
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:37,251
Just let me know where he is?

1405
01:38:39,086 --> 01:38:41,586
Come here, ask your
husband to say it out!

1406
01:38:42,006 --> 01:38:43,422
Come inside for a minute.

1407
01:38:44,606 --> 01:38:47,523
Come take the cash.

1408
01:38:47,681 --> 01:38:50,890
He is such an eminent person
- Just tell him.

1409
01:38:51,714 --> 01:38:53,949
Just tell him.
They have given the money.

1410
01:38:53,974 --> 01:38:55,390
Tell them if you know.

1411
01:39:17,252 --> 01:39:19,767
My father in law called me
saying he wanted to talk to me.

1412
01:39:19,829 --> 01:39:22,009
When I went there I
saw them all there.

1413
01:39:22,544 --> 01:39:24,252
Are we the clan lusting after money?

1414
01:39:24,806 --> 01:39:25,806
I told them to get out with money.

1415
01:39:26,179 --> 01:39:28,429
Else will chop.

1416
01:39:28,614 --> 01:39:30,156
Only then they left.

1417
01:39:30,572 --> 01:39:31,572
They are scared.

1418
01:39:31,734 --> 01:39:33,817
They are trying all
tricks that they can.

1419
01:39:34,384 --> 01:39:35,384
First..

1420
01:39:36,051 --> 01:39:37,051
I was firm..

1421
01:39:38,293 --> 01:39:39,293
that I should not say
anything even if they insist.

1422
01:39:41,181 --> 01:39:42,181
Then..

1423
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,666
my wife and mother in law..

1424
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:48,695
took me aside..

1425
01:39:49,408 --> 01:39:50,742
and spoke to me.
Then...

1426
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,583
You told them where Kittu is?
- No..

1427
01:39:55,195 --> 01:39:56,195
No I didn't tell.

1428
01:39:56,382 --> 01:39:57,382
Then?

1429
01:39:58,652 --> 01:39:59,652
But..

1430
01:40:00,867 --> 01:40:04,075
for a minute I was scared that
I will tell them everything.

1431
01:40:06,824 --> 01:40:08,199
I don't think I deserve to..

1432
01:40:09,103 --> 01:40:10,103
stay with you.

1433
01:40:11,657 --> 01:40:12,657
I am leaving.

1434
01:40:12,682 --> 01:40:13,682
Hey!

1435
01:40:14,223 --> 01:40:15,473
Why are you talking about all this?

1436
01:40:15,692 --> 01:40:16,692
You didn't say anything.

1437
01:40:18,650 --> 01:40:19,650
I didn't.

1438
01:40:21,083 --> 01:40:22,458
But, I was lusting for money.

1439
01:40:26,129 --> 01:40:27,296
I am leaving.

1440
01:40:30,575 --> 01:40:31,575
But one thing.

1441
01:40:33,145 --> 01:40:36,270
I will never think
against you, ever!

1442
01:40:55,083 --> 01:40:58,166
All fighters have
lost due to deceit.

1443
01:40:59,711 --> 01:41:03,377
Please don't make us
lose this agitation.

1444
01:41:07,005 --> 01:41:08,755
Greetings!
Headlines.

1445
01:41:09,309 --> 01:41:12,067
The Arts college Student Kittu
alias Krishnakumar is missing..

1446
01:41:12,092 --> 01:41:13,550
Under mysterious circumstances
for over 5 days

1447
01:41:13,575 --> 01:41:15,138
To review the situation..

1448
01:41:15,163 --> 01:41:18,746
the Collector visited the
Police station of Pudhur today.

1449
01:41:20,752 --> 01:41:21,752
He's here.

1450
01:41:22,419 --> 01:41:23,794
Hello.
- Greetings

1451
01:41:24,169 --> 01:41:25,169
I heard about this.

1452
01:41:25,859 --> 01:41:27,192
Give me your petition formally.

1453
01:41:27,586 --> 01:41:29,544
I will take immediate action.
- Thanks

1454
01:41:41,877 --> 01:41:42,877
Kiitu.
- Brother.

1455
01:41:42,991 --> 01:41:44,532
Everything is going
as we planned.

1456
01:41:44,908 --> 01:41:47,533
The Chief Secretary directly
spoke to the Collector.

1457
01:41:48,127 --> 01:41:50,211
Our concerns will be
addressed in 2 to 3 days.

1458
01:41:51,502 --> 01:41:52,961
Really?
- Yes.

1459
01:41:53,127 --> 01:41:55,961
After everything is done.
On Friday,  I will send Balu there.

1460
01:41:56,556 --> 01:41:58,723
You surrender in the
Court of Madurai. - Okay.

1461
01:41:59,166 --> 01:42:00,333
Till then be careful.

1462
01:42:00,851 --> 01:42:02,172
Okay.
- Listen.

1463
01:42:02,197 --> 01:42:03,489
Take good care of that girl.

1464
01:42:06,369 --> 01:42:07,536
Sure.

1465
01:42:09,025 --> 01:42:09,900
What did he say?

1466
01:42:09,925 --> 01:42:10,925
All these problems are
coming to an end.

1467
01:42:11,461 --> 01:42:12,794
He says what we wished
for will come true.

1468
01:42:15,277 --> 01:42:17,101
After it comes true?

1469
01:42:19,910 --> 01:42:20,910
You should tell me.

1470
01:42:24,851 --> 01:42:26,782
Marriage?

1471
01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:44,570
It didn't wink.

1472
01:42:44,994 --> 01:42:45,994
It didn't hold hands.

1473
01:42:46,624 --> 01:42:49,165
It just came inside and
love has engulfed.

1474
01:42:49,614 --> 01:42:50,906
It sings its lullaby.

1475
01:42:51,806 --> 01:42:53,890
It gently wags its tail.

1476
01:42:55,623 --> 01:42:58,661
It didn't wink.
It didn't hold hands.

1477
01:42:58,686 --> 01:43:01,394
It just came inside and
love has engulfed.

1478
01:43:01,598 --> 01:43:03,056
It sings its lullaby.

1479
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:05,997
It gently wags its tail.

1480
01:43:07,515 --> 01:43:12,181
You will listen to
my song, Every day.

1481
01:43:13,585 --> 01:43:16,335
It didn't wink.
It didn't hold hands.

1482
01:43:16,587 --> 01:43:18,879
It will just seek plain lies.

1483
01:43:19,577 --> 01:43:21,281
It will appreciate.

1484
01:43:21,706 --> 01:43:24,039
With you my bundle
of colourful flowers.

1485
01:43:25,617 --> 01:43:28,394
It didn't wink.
It didn't hold hands.

1486
01:43:28,654 --> 01:43:31,597
It will just seek plain lies.

1487
01:43:31,621 --> 01:43:36,663
It will appreciate.
With you my bundle of colourful flowers.

1488
01:43:37,489 --> 01:43:41,989
You will not leave
my nest.

1489
01:43:43,253 --> 01:43:45,836
It's only you that everyday

1490
01:43:45,877 --> 01:43:49,252
That her heart swirls
Like a dust.

1491
01:43:49,277 --> 01:43:51,742
There's a joy..

1492
01:43:51,775 --> 01:43:54,942
That springs easily
with this.

1493
01:43:55,159 --> 01:43:58,951
It will take the sword with love
With lots of love.

1494
01:44:07,626 --> 01:44:08,626
It didn't wink.

1495
01:44:09,079 --> 01:44:10,079
It didn't hold hands.

1496
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:12,955
It just came inside and love has engulfed

1497
01:44:13,597 --> 01:44:18,139
It sings its lullaby.
It gently wags its tail.

1498
01:44:43,765 --> 01:44:46,633
The bells on the feet will
Hear the tune of the drums.

1499
01:44:46,658 --> 01:44:49,491
The Gods descent
down to look at you.

1500
01:44:49,516 --> 01:44:52,570
The bells on the feet will
Hear the tune of the drums.

1501
01:44:52,595 --> 01:44:55,512
The Gods descent
down to look at you.

1502
01:44:55,699 --> 01:44:58,366
I have come in your dreams
without telling you.

1503
01:44:58,615 --> 01:45:01,532
I will not be away
from you in this life.

1504
01:45:01,557 --> 01:45:04,390
I have come in your dreams
without telling you.

1505
01:45:04,606 --> 01:45:07,731
I will not be away
from you in this life.

1506
01:45:07,873 --> 01:45:11,498
This struggling life..

1507
01:45:11,670 --> 01:45:13,295
Will be sheer joy hereafter.

1508
01:45:13,871 --> 01:45:16,246
Even if we shower
abundant wealth

1509
01:45:16,271 --> 01:45:19,237
Won't get a person like you.

1510
01:45:19,849 --> 01:45:22,516
You dived deep
to emerge with the pearl

1511
01:45:22,626 --> 01:45:25,584
My life!

1512
01:45:31,647 --> 01:45:34,355
It didn't  wink
It didn't hold hands.

1513
01:45:34,495 --> 01:45:37,079
It just came inside and
love has engulfed.

1514
01:45:37,556 --> 01:45:41,765
It's sings its lullaby.
It gently wags its tail.

1515
01:45:41,790 --> 01:45:43,415
Wags its tail.

1516
01:45:43,596 --> 01:45:47,679
You will listen to my song,
every day.

1517
01:45:51,839 --> 01:45:55,673
Sir, as I told you Kittu is near
a small place in Kodaikanal.

1518
01:45:56,198 --> 01:45:57,990
My relative a young
girl is also with him.

1519
01:45:58,448 --> 01:46:00,282
If you send the police
and search for him there..

1520
01:46:00,759 --> 01:46:02,467
You will understand that I
am telling you the truth.

1521
01:46:03,278 --> 01:46:04,570
Okay.
I will take immediate action.

1522
01:46:05,235 --> 01:46:07,443
Balu! I want Kittu alive.

1523
01:46:08,188 --> 01:46:09,188
Go!

1524
01:46:27,863 --> 01:46:29,655
Make some tea! Quick!
Sir has to leave.

1525
01:46:31,967 --> 01:46:33,675
You want sugar or palm sugar?

1526
01:46:33,897 --> 01:46:35,397
Bala Brother!
- Palm sugar.

1527
01:46:35,823 --> 01:46:36,823
When did you come?

1528
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:38,870
Come.

1529
01:46:39,381 --> 01:46:40,410
I just came.

1530
01:46:40,435 --> 01:46:42,518
Chinnarasu Brother told me
that you will come tomorrow.

1531
01:46:42,751 --> 01:46:44,417
The Collector signed
this morning.

1532
01:46:44,615 --> 01:46:46,657
All your hardships
will reap its benefit.

1533
01:46:53,110 --> 01:46:54,276
I am so happy.

1534
01:46:55,651 --> 01:46:58,360
Come. We have to be in
the Court before 4 PM.

1535
01:46:58,589 --> 01:46:59,839
Give me five minutes.

1536
01:47:15,901 --> 01:47:16,901
Be safe.

1537
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:18,667
Bye.

1538
01:47:20,806 --> 01:47:21,972
Let's go, brother.

1539
01:48:42,626 --> 01:48:44,126
Which route are we
taking for Madurai?

1540
01:48:44,209 --> 01:48:45,538
From here Vathalagundu..

1541
01:48:45,563 --> 01:48:47,854
Sempatti, Vadipatti and
then we will reach Madurai.

1542
01:49:04,735 --> 01:49:05,735
What happened?

1543
01:49:15,190 --> 01:49:16,190
Brother!

1544
01:49:18,178 --> 01:49:19,303
Gopi.. Raja..

1545
01:49:22,649 --> 01:49:23,982
Ask him to take the Vehicle.

1546
01:49:24,596 --> 01:49:25,596
Brother, take the vehicle.

1547
01:49:27,452 --> 01:49:28,535
Ask him to take it.

1548
01:49:29,755 --> 01:49:31,127
Balu brother.

1549
01:49:31,956 --> 01:49:32,831
Ask..

1550
01:49:34,589 --> 01:49:35,714
Balu Brother..

1551
01:49:35,978 --> 01:49:36,978
Vehicle..

1552
01:49:54,252 --> 01:49:56,002
Get into the vehicle.

1553
01:49:56,251 --> 01:49:58,209
I am telling you to
get into the vehicle.

1554
01:50:03,361 --> 01:50:06,152
Catch him alive.

1555
01:50:06,493 --> 01:50:08,993
Catch him alive.
- Don't leave him.

1556
01:50:09,248 --> 01:50:10,623
Catch him.
Don't spare him.

1557
01:50:11,167 --> 01:50:12,584
Catch him alive.

1558
01:50:19,495 --> 01:50:20,329
Don't leave him.

1559
01:50:20,545 --> 01:50:21,920
Catch him.

1560
01:50:29,448 --> 01:50:30,990
Run..

1561
01:51:10,563 --> 01:51:11,604
Kittu.

1562
01:51:38,368 --> 01:51:40,409
Surround him.

1563
01:52:50,607 --> 01:52:51,440
Gomathi.

1564
01:53:06,894 --> 01:53:09,019
Lawyer Balu betrayed us.

1565
01:53:09,306 --> 01:53:10,306
Lawyer?

1566
01:53:10,549 --> 01:53:11,174
Yes.

1567
01:53:24,588 --> 01:53:25,713
What happened?

1568
01:53:30,568 --> 01:53:31,776
Police.

1569
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:39,509
Come.

1570
01:54:02,578 --> 01:54:04,578
I had my doubts, when
the Collector said

1571
01:54:04,686 --> 01:54:07,322
let it rest for two days,
he was supposed to sign today.

1572
01:54:07,537 --> 01:54:10,454
What do you mean?
- But I least expected Balu to do this.

1573
01:54:10,858 --> 01:54:12,150
It's because of traitors like him..

1574
01:54:12,733 --> 01:54:13,733
that we have lost several times.

1575
01:54:14,478 --> 01:54:17,186
Under no circumstances
should the police catch you.

1576
01:54:17,869 --> 01:54:19,723
Then all entire efforts
will go in vain.

1577
01:54:19,748 --> 01:54:21,373
Alright! You don't panic.

1578
01:54:23,105 --> 01:54:24,939
What we wished for
will come true.

1579
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:28,264
I'll never get caught
to the cops.

1580
01:54:30,324 --> 01:54:32,241
I will hang up now.

1581
01:54:32,439 --> 01:54:33,439
You be alert.

1582
01:55:15,139 --> 01:55:16,556
We need to print posters

1583
01:55:16,764 --> 01:55:17,764
And paste it across the entire State.

1584
01:55:19,550 --> 01:55:20,550
Gomathi has come.

1585
01:55:57,261 --> 01:55:59,888
Kittu! Did you think about
what you are saying?

1586
01:56:00,326 --> 01:56:01,909
I thought about it.

1587
01:56:02,939 --> 01:56:05,897
Our people for ages have
been suppressed and deprived..

1588
01:56:06,045 --> 01:56:09,003
and were hoping that someone
will voice their concerns.

1589
01:56:09,412 --> 01:56:13,027
Now the entire group is
seeing Chinnarasu Brother

1590
01:56:13,052 --> 01:56:14,094
as their leader.

1591
01:56:16,962 --> 01:56:19,795
They believe there is
truth in this agitation.

1592
01:56:21,977 --> 01:56:23,518
I don’t want to go back..

1593
01:56:24,756 --> 01:56:25,987
and make it a lie.

1594
01:56:26,699 --> 01:56:27,699
Look Gomathi!

1595
01:56:27,842 --> 01:56:30,009
I wanted to do so much
after becoming a Collector

1596
01:56:30,785 --> 01:56:32,245
If that has to come true..

1597
01:56:32,576 --> 01:56:34,409
I will have to really disappear.

1598
01:56:35,769 --> 01:56:38,978
Imagine what a lot of good can
happen through Chinnarasu Brother.

1599
01:56:43,558 --> 01:56:44,433
I am leaving.

1600
01:56:51,389 --> 01:56:53,097
Then take me with you.

1601
01:56:55,355 --> 01:56:56,147
Gomathi!

1602
01:56:56,696 --> 01:56:58,029
If I take you with me..

1603
01:56:58,054 --> 01:57:00,596
Then the entire effort
will become meaningless.

1604
01:57:00,951 --> 01:57:03,868
Everyone will talk ill

1605
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:06,564
that I eloped with a girl.

1606
01:57:06,666 --> 01:57:08,337
Try to understand.

1607
01:57:10,868 --> 01:57:12,058
In sometime..

1608
01:57:12,147 --> 01:57:15,605
all our needs will be fulfilled through
the efforts of Chinnarasu Brother.

1609
01:57:15,902 --> 01:57:16,819
I have faith in that.

1610
01:57:17,972 --> 01:57:19,551
Wait till then.

1611
01:57:19,776 --> 01:57:21,026
I will call you after that.

1612
01:57:22,647 --> 01:57:26,105
This is the solution to avenge the
death of your father as well.

1613
01:57:33,732 --> 01:57:34,732
Alright!
Leave.

1614
01:58:19,079 --> 01:58:20,370
Where did he go?

1615
01:58:25,256 --> 01:58:27,173
He didn’t tell me
where he's going.

1616
01:58:27,579 --> 01:58:29,412
He told me to give
you this letter.

1617
01:58:42,982 --> 01:58:46,024
Chinnarasu Brother!
I am writing this letter with great joy

1618
01:58:46,337 --> 01:58:49,337
Our people will have to even
beg for the water they drink.

1619
01:58:49,472 --> 01:58:50,648
they have to bend down

1620
01:58:50,759 --> 01:58:54,009
and remove their footwear and
can't even use the common path

1621
01:58:54,225 --> 01:58:55,683
Don't have access to education.

1622
01:58:55,847 --> 01:58:57,931
The struggle of our people go
through should change Brother!

1623
01:58:58,712 --> 01:59:02,170
Every time someone asks
me about my caste

1624
01:59:02,693 --> 01:59:03,747
I have hesitated

1625
01:59:03,772 --> 01:59:05,590
I was unable to say the caste

1626
01:59:05,615 --> 01:59:07,990
I have withered in pain

1627
01:59:08,165 --> 01:59:10,870
and cried several times
Within me!

1628
01:59:10,895 --> 01:59:14,687
No life born after this should
go through this embarrassment

1629
01:59:14,951 --> 01:59:16,597
There are several struggles that have

1630
01:59:16,622 --> 01:59:17,663
been defeated
because of traitors.

1631
01:59:17,933 --> 01:59:19,683
Inspite of it several struggles

1632
01:59:20,152 --> 01:59:21,761
have won because of sacrifice.

1633
01:59:21,786 --> 01:59:23,161
For our struggle to succeed

1634
01:59:24,035 --> 01:59:25,139
I should die.

1635
01:59:25,164 --> 01:59:26,039
Tell my mother, sister

1636
01:59:26,064 --> 01:59:27,064
and Gomathi

1637
01:59:27,235 --> 01:59:28,735
That I seek their pardon.

1638
01:59:28,995 --> 01:59:30,579
Our struggle should succeed.

1639
01:59:40,021 --> 01:59:40,896
What happened?

1640
01:59:42,268 --> 01:59:43,185
Why are you crying?

1641
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:48,070
What's written in that letter?

1642
01:59:48,849 --> 01:59:49,724
Tell me.

1643
01:59:53,923 --> 01:59:54,798
Tell me!

1644
02:00:07,728 --> 02:00:09,186
Greetings!

1645

The student Kittu missing
for over 15 days

1646

1647
