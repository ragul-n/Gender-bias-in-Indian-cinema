there is a happiness hidden in
missing jenny

6
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:56,190
because today's show producer

7
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,492

8
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:19,677

20
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,177
why you call me?

21
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,876
I have a small wish

22
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,182
i want to file a predition in court

23
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,715
my death predition

24
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,864
its just a small predition

25
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,278
you want me to throw table over you?

26
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,614
You are asking permission from court
to kill yourself?

27
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,092
And today suddenly you took
a big decision

28
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:57,763
there is no case like this in india,
do as i'm saying

29
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,669
you will get your fees

30
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:15,147
bring a packet of condoms and
a beautiful woman

31
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,803
sorry i'm disturbing in the morning

32
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,823
you laugh on it most

33
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:04,400
i'm going to his house for dialisis.
You will also come there, we will talk to him

34
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,183
you have taken a big decision without
asking anyone?

35
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:34,492
Do you think science will do progress

36
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,037
will my hands work?

37
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,648
Your answer is also no

38
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,026
you have shown way of life
to many peoples

39
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,700
i enjoyed a successful life
for 14 years

40
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,140
i dont wanna live with a help of machines

41
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:32,553
you want me to explain in court that
you are mentally sick and you dont want to live

42
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,961
and none of the court in whole world
will listen to you

43
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,894
they will listen

44
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:58,945
because if you lose this case then
my life is a life time imprisonment

45
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,534
both parties are here?

46
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,544
My client has put a request in
court to commit suicide

47
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,954
you are challenging article 21 of
indian contitution

48
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:50,196
i believe time has come to change law

49
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,699
its not so easy like changing clothes

50
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,731

ethonesia appeals

he is asking legally permission of ethonesia

53
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:14,022
you mean to say death is the
solution of all suffering

54
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:20,360
my client could also did this 14 years
ago when he had an accident

55
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:27,027
he tell to his listeners on his radio
show to live life

56
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,973

182
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:12,659
i hope you are understanding here
we are talking about me

183
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:21,962
the pain you are feeling now,
we felt it before

184
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:26,240
we know why you want to take
this step

185
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:32,698
we need your counselling

186
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:38,204
i feel pity on you.
You trap innocent peoples

187
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:44,010
you are a coward and weak person.
I'm telling you to stop it

188
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:07,207
why you daily need to take votes
from peoples

189
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,283
and now before saying good bye
one last call

190
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,434
you recognize me

191
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:40,237
dont tell your assistant to put
down the phone

192
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,507
i have learnt this from you

193
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:51,848
i tell this to my listeners that
stella was my assisstant few years back

194
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:08,567
i also tell that once you distributed
me into 2 parts

195
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:16,174
i'm talking about that day when you had
an accident

196
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:22,583
because of you i married to mark

197
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:30,186
you took promise to dont meet me again

198
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:38,694
this show is for ethinesia,
not for us

199
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:44,467
tell me your vote

200
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:16,243
judge have to listen us

201
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,180
i will not to got court alone this time

202
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,480
i want ethan to come with me

203
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:37,657
now you cant deny it

204
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:49,401
i say sorry for coming without informing

205
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:07,689
you come here to give vote?

206
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:12,823
Its not good to solve it with radio

207
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:16,557
god has given us life

208
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,527
and we dont have any authority to play with it

209
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,071
and he has a right to play with us

210
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:27,675
he can do anything with us.
Our religion dont give permission for it

211
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:32,313
thats why i'm appealing in court
rather than church

212
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:36,610
god tell us to fight with all problems

213
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:44,389
you dont need hand and legs for fight,
trust him

214
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:00,335
i trust god thats why
i'm dying to meet him

215
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,665
are you coming with me?

216
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:39,138
The thing you are going to do is
a bad deed

217
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:43,743
because just now you participated
in this bad deed

218
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,636
we have heard judge is a very
strict man

219
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,231
are you feeling alone?

220
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:03,816
We have heard and read many things
about this case

221
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:07,281
its better that we listen it from
mr mascaren from his mouth

222
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,224
thats why he come to court

223
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:15,164
i want to tell you that after accident,
since 12 years he never come out from house

224
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:21,261
thats why i'm requesting you to allow
mr mascuren to say some words

225
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,620
she is thinking something else

226
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:49,290
court will tell you next hearing

227
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:59,035
prosticuter needs a some more time
but mr mascuren come with full preparation

228
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,588
and this court dont have even
2 minutes for him

229
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:29,930
please sit on your place

230
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:45,349
i can feel how much you will
have problem to come here

231
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:54,025
our next hearing will be in your house

232
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:59,799
we will have lunch together

233
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,341
why you bring me here?

234
01:05:56,485 --> 01:06:00,216
I took whole night to prepare speech
and judge did not listen to it

235
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:24,445
our day is incomplete without
his harsh words

236
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:42,199
how are you?

237
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:47,872
I wanted to meet you

238
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:53,013
i was dying to meet you

239
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:01,784
and you also dont want that i call you

240
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:54,535
we all know that its not an ordinary case

241
01:11:55,077 --> 01:12:01,141
its first time in indian history that court's
hearing is in a person's house

242
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:14,359
he is my client
mr ethan mascaranus

243
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:20,262
he has filed a case for death

244
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:29,838
the suffering that we will never understand

245
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:38,084
dr naik can you tell something about
his present condition

246
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:46,594
his heart has become weak

247
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:53,791
he condition is becoming worst.
With in few days he will also need ventilator

248
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:57,864
is there a hope for recovery?

249
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:07,781
Can you write it on stamp paper?

250
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:09,910
That there is no chance for his recovery

251
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:19,221
so mr mascarus cant be in billions?

252
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:23,059
As a doctor are you satisfied with
his decision

253
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:27,997
my profession tells me to save life

254
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:38,440
and i think mr mascaren is the only person
in this world who is facing this

255
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:52,349
every person's requirement is different

256
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:15,609
we have 1000 of case waiting to be heard

257
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:37,530
you are staying in this house for many years

258
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:41,203
what kinda person he is?

259
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:47,881
A genius person is normally mad

260
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:56,655
he always fun with me and whenver
i made a mistake he scold me

261
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:59,421
what he do when he is angry?

262
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:00,356
Sometimes he tell us to break plates

263
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:46,166
he is mentally sick

264
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:22,800
what kinda relation you have
with him?

265
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:25,412
I'm her nurse since 12 years

266
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:29,481
you are very beautiful as a nurse

267
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:33,279
what is relation of it with this case?

268
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:38,350
When he tell you about this predition?
I read it in newspaper

269
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:48,434
i feel his suffering

270
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:59,105
and you want to take benefit

271
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:04,681
why a beautiful lady like sophia
waste her whole life for a patient?

272
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:11,719
She has already filed divorce
papers with his husband

273
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:16,525
for a patient whom she is seving
for 12 years

274
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:21,291
she is tired of servicing her.
She wants to get rid of it

275
01:17:54,503 --> 01:18:00,703
there is even not 2 months salary
to give to sophia

276
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:46,279
you love him alot

277
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:50,249
then why dont you live with him?

278
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:52,989
He wants me to dont live with him

279
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:56,163
he dont want that i see
him in this condition

280
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:06,530
but i believe he has authority
over his life

281
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:39,874
it belongs to only ethan

282
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:56,322
if your son needs your help
in it then?

283
01:19:56,925 --> 01:20:00,622
Will a mother help his son for his death?

284
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:16,898
I have listened to all witness

285
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:21,271

286
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:30,976
I want to show you a magic trick

287
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:52,499

290
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:32,375

292
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:33,607
do you know how much
you feel bad inside?

293
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:42,681
You couldn't tolerate 60 seconds

294
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:09,977

295
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:14,847

303
01:31:28,282 --> 01:31:30,910
i felt very bad when i heard about
your mother

304
01:31:33,387 --> 01:31:39,883
