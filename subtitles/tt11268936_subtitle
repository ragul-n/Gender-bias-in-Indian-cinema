afraided, Mr. Speaker,

174
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:50,473
that their lands might've 
gone to these people.

175
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:55,251
'Happy Sunday,' did they ever 
make the Sunday a happy one?

176
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:57,389
Their highlight program is,

177
00:20:57,852 --> 00:20:58,901
'Domalapai Dandayatra' 
(attach on mosqutoes)

178
00:20:59,297 --> 00:21:00,641
What the hell are you talking?

179
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:04,004
-Think before you utter! 
-Hold on! It's a fact, Mr. Speaker.

180
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:07,647
[indistinct voices] 
Mr. Speaker, attack on mosquitoes.

181
00:21:07,938 --> 00:21:09,306
-Keep quiet... Keep quiet... 
-Mr. Speaker, what is this?

182
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:10,757
-Keep quiet... 
-Hold on for a minute!

183
00:21:10,776 --> 00:21:11,810
-Okay...! 
-Should we keep quiet while they...

184
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:12,845
-...mock an experienced leader? 
-Let me complete!

185
00:21:12,877 --> 00:21:13,726
I'll give you a chance.

186
00:21:13,926 --> 00:21:14,965
-Mr. Speaker! 
-Let him speak.

187
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,724
Mr. Speaker, in our Kurnool...

188
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:19,210
-You don't have the guts to do! 
-Hold on...!

189
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:20,718
-How dare you mock Mr. Babu! 
-Mr. Speaker.

190
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:23,007
There is a huge cut out 
of Mr. Babu in Kurnool.

191
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:25,583
-It will be very huge like Bahubali. 
-Hmm.

192
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:31,148
It has a huge crown, sword in his 
hands and a mosquito beside the sword.

193
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:35,389
[chaos] Sit down... 
What is this?

194
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:37,745
-Sit down... I'll give you a chance. 
-What kind of governance is this?

195
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:39,894
-I don't understand this! 
-Keep quiet... Keep quiet...

196
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,829
-Keep quiet...! 
-Am I not saying the facts?

197
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:45,393
Yes, sir!

198
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:46,922
Why is it so sour?

199
00:21:46,945 --> 00:21:48,722
-Know the subject and speak! 
-There is a rumour, Mr. Speaker!

200
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:49,719
-Sit down! 
-What is it?

201
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:52,566
The matter is weak but the 
publicity is in peaks!

202
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,410
-Once again, Mr. Speaker! 
-[indistinct voices]

203
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:56,971
-Hold on! Keep quiet...! 
-The matter is weak...

204
00:21:57,171 --> 00:21:59,008
-...but the publicity is in peaks! 
-Keep quiet!

205
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:01,144
-That's all, Mr. Speaker! 
-Sit down...!

206
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:03,598
[crowd shouting]

207
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:05,727
Mrs. Puja, you speak!

208
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:11,830
Mr. Speaker, we follow our leader's path.

209
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:13,588
And that's the reason we are staying calm

210
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:16,530
and tolerating these 'Velugu 
Desam's' non sense!

211
00:22:16,894 --> 00:22:18,886
They just lie all the time!

212
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:23,852
[patting the table]

213
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:29,271
Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Puja is 
well experienced in the films,

214
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,033
and delivering the dialogues...

215
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,476
-...in the assembly as if it's a shooting! 
-Mr. Chowdary!

216
00:22:32,676 --> 00:22:33,499
-How dare you mock the development... 
-Sit down!

217
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,600
-...made by him! 
-Mrs. Puja is speaking, isn't she?

218
00:22:34,862 --> 00:22:37,498
Hey! You'd die if you shout aloud!

219
00:22:37,518 --> 00:22:38,847
-Okay... 
-Shut your mouth and sit down!

220
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,986
-I'm sparing you since it's the assembly! 
-She is not respecting the age!

221
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:42,833
It would've been different if 
it was outside the assembly!

222
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,253
The film hasn't finished 
yet but it has started now!

223
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,756
You'll be finished by 
the interval scene!

224
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:51,472
[chaos]

225
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:52,553
Do you have the eligibility...

226
00:22:52,643 --> 00:22:54,087
-...to compare yourself with Mr. Babu? 
-Keep quiet...

227
00:22:54,462 --> 00:22:55,728
What is she saying Mr. Speaker? 
[calling bell ringing]

228
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,147
Won't you give us a chance Mr. Speaker?

229
00:22:57,283 --> 00:22:58,653
-Huh? 
-Mr. Babu, please speak!

230
00:22:59,202 --> 00:23:01,748
Mr. Speaker, 
what the hell are they talking?

231
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,634
My experience is more than your age!

232
00:23:05,189 --> 00:23:06,806
They are doing charade!

233
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:10,541
Mr. Speaker, even we meant that he is old.

234
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,171
Ask him to go and play 
with his grandchildren.

235
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,475
You speak, Mr. Anil.

236
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:23,152
Mr. Babu, don't irritate us 
by repeating the same things.

237
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:27,161
Mr. Speaker... 
[indistinct voices]

238
00:23:29,394 --> 00:23:32,337
The tenure isn't important,

239
00:23:33,236 --> 00:23:36,480
it's important whether the 
bullet is fired or not.

240
00:23:38,462 --> 00:23:39,130
Hmm!

241
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:46,181
Yours is a lucky 
lottery but mine is history.

242
00:23:50,233 --> 00:23:53,787
You keep watching, 
your history turns into a mystery.

243
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:55,000
-Mr. Speaker. 
-Mr. Babu, you please continue.

244
00:23:55,304 --> 00:23:56,798
I've established the Hi-tech city!

245
00:23:57,277 --> 00:24:01,426
I've built the Outer Ring Road 
and the international airport.

246
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:08,006
I've fostered the Telugu people's pride.

247
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,469
How dare are they to 
talk about my history!

248
00:24:10,954 --> 00:24:13,455
-What the hell are they speaking? 
-Okay, sit down Mr. Babu.

249
00:24:13,628 --> 00:24:17,288
Are you speaking about the pride?

250
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:21,275
It's you who backstabbed that pride!

251
00:24:21,686 --> 00:24:22,876
What are you talking?

252
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,237
Would you speak whatever you feel like?

253
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:28,175
Please keep quiet... Keep quiet... 
[indistinct voices]

254
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:34,211
Please keep quiet... Keep quiet...

255
00:24:34,482 --> 00:24:36,560
-What are you talking? 
-Please, sit down.

256
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:38,845
Mr. Babu, 
please ask your men to sit down.

257
00:24:39,423 --> 00:24:43,272
[crowd shouting]

258
00:24:47,774 --> 00:24:50,551
Let him finish. Sit down, 
he is talking, isn't he?

259
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,802
What the hell are you saying?

260
00:24:52,472 --> 00:24:55,566
Do you ever have the experience of 
handling the government?

261
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:58,358
-Sit down... Sit down... 
-How dare you criticise Mr. Babu?

262
00:24:58,913 --> 00:25:00,731
-By seeing the development by Mr. Babu... 
-Sit down...!

263
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:01,814
-Please, sit down... 
-...and by not being able to cope,

264
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:03,503
-...you are talking so! 
-Sit down... Sit down...

265
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:05,867
-You are not following the assembly rules. 
-Sit down... Sit down...

266
00:25:06,364 --> 00:25:08,567
He is being rude with the 
former chief minister!

267
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:22,969
The development made by Babu...

268
00:25:23,076 --> 00:25:25,528
Do you have the right to 
compare with Mr. Babu?

269
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:31,668
Mr. Speaker... 
[indistinct voices]

270
00:25:33,376 --> 00:25:35,999
Keep quiet... Keep quiet...

271
00:25:37,822 --> 00:25:42,185
[call bell ringing] Keep quiet... 
Keep quiet...

272
00:25:42,746 --> 00:25:44,204
Keep quiet... Keep quiet...

273
00:25:45,913 --> 00:25:48,504
Are you the fifth-grade studying children? 
Huh?

274
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,500
Shouting at each other, 
fighting, plucking hair,

275
00:25:54,064 --> 00:25:57,423
threatening to beat, 
throwing chalk piece at the teacher!

276
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,466
I've seen all of these in 
my fifth standard itself!

277
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:01,961
Have some decency!

278
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,562
Discuss seriously on the public issues.

279
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:08,340
Hmm!

280
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:10,340
[scoffs]

281
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:12,855
-Sir... 
-Hmm...!

282
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:14,356
-Do you want a glass of water? 
-No, thanks.

283
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:24,114
You talk.

284
00:26:31,094 --> 00:26:33,675
Mr. Speaker, 
coming to the Department of Irrigation,

285
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:37,796
10,000 cusecs water which should 
come in a minute or in 20 seconds,

286
00:26:37,974 --> 00:26:40,692
wouldn't come even in an hour in the 
previous government.

287
00:26:40,813 --> 00:26:46,797
-But in our governance... 
-[snoring]

288
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:52,061
[snoring]

289
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:56,452
[snoring]

290
00:27:07,271 --> 00:27:10,809
-Sir... Sir... 
-Keep quiet... Keep quiet...

291
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,539
-Sir, everybody is already quiet. 
-I know.

292
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:17,305
-I told myself to keep quiet! 
-Okay, sir.

293
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:20,937
Mr. Tadipaka of Mana Sena.

294
00:27:22,144 --> 00:27:23,475
Mr. Speaker, let me open the paper.

295
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:25,699
What would you achieve 
by coming here alone?

296
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,243
Alone? 
How could you laugh at me?

297
00:27:29,753 --> 00:27:30,709
Why are you laughing?

298
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,772
He is speaking, isn't he?

299
00:27:33,092 --> 00:27:34,093
Please, keep quiet!

300
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:35,915
Mr. Speaker, ignore that...

301
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:39,164
The numbers are read from 1 to 151.

302
00:27:39,474 --> 00:27:44,235
Similarly, they read from 1 to 
24 but they don't say 'Number 1.'

303
00:27:44,297 --> 00:27:45,825
I am the 'Number 1,' Mr. Speaker.

304
00:27:46,391 --> 00:27:48,769
Why did our leader 
make me win and sent here?

305
00:27:49,227 --> 00:27:51,734
It's to fight against the public issues.

306
00:27:52,697 --> 00:27:55,196
I'm the number one in this assembly.

307
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:57,863
-Why don't you give me a chance? 
-[crowd shouting]

308
00:27:58,145 --> 00:28:03,500
-Mr. Speaker, give me a chance to speak. 
-[crowd shouting]

309
00:28:04,795 --> 00:28:06,868
Mr. CM, you please talk.

310
00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:17,090
Mr. Speaker, 
what Mr. Babu says looks like...

311
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:23,773
'Our ancestors were great, 
so assume we are too'

312
00:28:25,475 --> 00:28:27,676
He stills feels that he is the CM.

313
00:28:27,946 --> 00:28:29,871
Mr. Speaker, tell him that he 
belongs to the opposition party.

314
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:36,836
-Keep quiet... Keep quiet... 
-What the hell are you talking?

315
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:38,636
-Sit down... Sit down... 
-Mr. Speaker...

316
00:28:38,753 --> 00:28:41,071
-You are being impolite with our leader! 
-Keep quiet... Keep quiet...

317
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,403
You don't have respect.

318
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,003
You don't have courtesy!

319
00:28:44,146 --> 00:28:46,057
-The CM is speaking, isn't he? 
-And you say yourself as the rulers!

320
00:28:46,578 --> 00:28:49,580
-And you say you ruled for 80 years... 
-Keep quiet... Keep quiet...

321
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,749
-What are you saying? 
-Sit down... Sit down...

322
00:28:52,949 --> 00:28:55,598
-Hold on... Keep quiet... Keep quiet... 
-Do you think as if it is your Kadapa?

323
00:28:56,143 --> 00:28:58,178
-Mr. Speaker, they don't respect. 
-What are you talking?

324
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,319
Do you ever have the experience 
of handling the government?

325
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:03,060
We need not learn from you!

326
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:09,230
[music mutes voice]

327
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:52,295
[music mutes voice]

328
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,166
-What are you saying? 
-Mr Speaker.

329
00:30:14,344 --> 00:30:14,842
What the hell are you saying?

330
00:30:14,902 --> 00:30:17,362
-What Mr Babu said is like... 
-How can you criticize the elders?

331
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:18,519
What do you know about our leader?

332
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:19,319
-Mr Bhicchamma Naidu... 
-Do you even have...

333
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:21,351
-...eligibility to talk about our leader? 
-Sit down!

334
00:30:21,426 --> 00:30:23,520
-How can you criticize Mr Babu? 
-Sit down!

335
00:30:23,915 --> 00:30:24,545
Sit down!

336
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,502
-Is this any proper behaviour? 
-Sit down!

337
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:29,205
Do you know the assembly etiquette?

338
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:31,665
There's one here who'd get 
scared if you widen your eyes!

339
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,628
Is this the way of 
behaving in the assembly?

340
00:30:33,686 --> 00:30:35,292
-Bulking up is not enough... 
-What are you talking?

341
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:37,106
-Use your brain as well! 
-Is this the way a CM should talk?

342
00:30:37,155 --> 00:30:38,603
You're just a footman.

343
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:45,001
[weeping]

344
00:30:45,897 --> 00:30:47,113
What happened, Biccham?

345
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:51,677
I don't mind if he called me 
a dog or swine or a bull, sir.

346
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:54,100
But he called me a footman, sir!

347
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:58,203
Calm down... Just calm down.

348
00:30:58,246 --> 00:31:01,716
-[weeping] 
-Don't cry.

349
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:03,580
Calm down... Just calm down.

350
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:32,775
[cameras click] I felt very sad after 
watching the assembly sessions on the TV.

351
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:34,949
I couldn't sleep last night.

352
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:37,748
I doubted if our nation 
is really democratic!

353
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:42,600
Instead of discussing the public 
problems in the assembly,

354
00:31:42,656 --> 00:31:44,854
they are chiding each other 
which is a very unfortunate thing.

355
00:31:46,843 --> 00:31:47,834
I'm telling just one thing,

356
00:31:47,926 --> 00:31:49,387
the day I become the CM,

357
00:31:49,718 --> 00:31:54,309
I'll pass a law which would make 
only the CM to talk in the assembly.

358
00:31:54,509 --> 00:31:55,996
Hmm! Be wary of it!

359
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,157
Hail Mana Sena!

360
00:32:01,114 --> 00:32:03,646
Arrange a meeting with all 
our people, in the evening.

361
00:32:04,544 --> 00:32:07,378
We shall think of ways to make 
our party appeasing to the public.

362
00:32:08,106 --> 00:32:08,622
Hmm...

363
00:32:11,023 --> 00:32:12,555
Where is the rest of the security?

364
00:32:13,003 --> 00:32:14,022
Sir, the thing is that...

365
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:26,185
By keeping economic needs 
of the state in mind,

366
00:32:26,442 --> 00:32:28,894
the government felt that 
the Z-category security...

367
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,828
...is not needed for 
the opposition leader.

368
00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:33,967
So, it would provide only 
mandatory minimal security.

369
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,238
I'm sure they've done this 
to humiliate you, father.

370
00:32:42,535 --> 00:32:45,867
Since they've been humiliating you so 
much, can't you do anything about it?

371
00:32:49,796 --> 00:32:53,252
What can we do? 
We have to wait for the right time.

372
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:17,461
[music over voice]

373
00:33:17,972 --> 00:33:23,964
[siren wailing]

374
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:31,104
Don't think you'd free 
after this slap, Obulu.

375
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:34,797
There is an ongoing case 
against you as per law.

376
00:33:41,372 --> 00:33:42,737
I didn't do anything, brother.

377
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,360
Do you think that we came 
to power to do atrocities?

378
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:48,603
Well, try to prove 
yourself innocent in the court.

379
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:49,874
Get out of here.

380
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,236
The thing is that... Umm...

381
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,684
No matter how much I tell you, 
you don't mend your old habits.

382
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:09,306
-I somehow feel that he's reformed. 
-Hmph!

383
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:15,108
-I don't trust. Keep an eye on him. 
-Hmm...

384
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:22,853
What's happening in this state?

385
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:25,233
I feel pained to see these circumstances.

386
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,714
They've ignored Nelson Mandela's words

387
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:30,844
of living in harmony 
irrespective of caste and religion.

388
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:32,855
and committing murders in this manner.

389
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:35,817
And don't think that I would stay mum 
like Velugu Desam Party members.

390
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:40,775
I'm there for every 
person from this caste.

391
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:42,942
Our soldiers are there 
for you. Remember this.

392
00:34:43,452 --> 00:34:44,559
Slowly,

393
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:49,549
high intense tensions 
began internally in Vijayawada.

394
00:34:49,977 --> 00:34:55,450
Whatever happens in any corner of 
the state, the accusers are blaming

395
00:34:55,474 --> 00:34:58,655
the incumbent party as if a stined 
glass shows the other side with stains

396
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:01,571
CROWD: CM... Down... Down..._______

397
00:35:01,661 --> 00:35:02,841
When that's the situation,

398
00:35:02,864 --> 00:35:07,345
Mr Babu, who was ex-CM, is 
going through mental agony

399
00:35:07,436 --> 00:35:13,088
thinking whether his past mistakes are 
responsible for his terrible defeat.

400
00:35:17,203 --> 00:35:18,631
[bangles tinkling]

401
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:21,019
Dear husband... Come, let's have dinner.

402
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,979
Father-in-law, 
how long will you be like this?

403
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,371
Come to the dinner.

404
00:35:42,051 --> 00:35:43,486
Forgive me, Ramani.

405
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:47,053
What happened?

406
00:35:47,474 --> 00:35:49,470
I know your pain, dear.

407
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:01,170
Mr Babu, all our people 
are here to talk to you.

408
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,281
Father-in-law is not in a state to talk.

409
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,267
Mr Babu has to compulsorily talk now.

410
00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:13,267
He should know about 
what's happening in the capital.

411
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:18,869
This isn't the problem of state or 
its people to leave it to itself.

412
00:36:21,338 --> 00:36:23,723
This is our problem. Our party's problem.

413
00:36:31,048 --> 00:36:33,899
Mr Babu, what shall we do?

414
00:36:35,965 --> 00:36:37,357
Brother... I'm talking to you.

415
00:36:39,015 --> 00:36:43,913
The from Kadapa region 
leaders have curbed...

416
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:46,897
our valuable Amaravathi and 
Krishna areas like ghosts.

417
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:52,407
The ghosts wouldn't remain idle, 
they are sucking our blood.

418
00:36:54,207 --> 00:36:55,914
They've put their hotel beside ours.

419
00:36:56,727 --> 00:36:57,495
We have tolerated that.

420
00:36:58,543 --> 00:37:00,966
It is our land and they're 
doing the real estate business.

421
00:37:01,948 --> 00:37:02,994
We have tolerated that as well.

422
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:12,977
They've killed four of our men 
as they weren't obeying them, sir.

423
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,435
All these days, we did politics.

424
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:18,327
But they are indulged only in factionism.

425
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:23,719
They have no diplomacy. 
They just decide that's it.

426
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:26,718
Vijaywada, which used to be 
adorned in yellow colour until recenty,

427
00:37:26,742 --> 00:37:29,278
turned white like a pearl.

428
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,769
Wherever you see, all you can find are 
white shirts and white lungis attire.

429
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:35,745
It's true, brother.

430
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:40,208
We're ensuring that this news isn't 
reaching you as you'd become sad but,

431
00:37:40,977 --> 00:37:46,921
our people are standing behind the doors 
and peeping through holes of windows.

432
00:37:47,585 --> 00:37:50,230
If this continues, our farms 
would also turn white from yellow,

433
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:54,058
and become red due to 
blood, after they chop.

434
00:37:55,168 --> 00:37:56,633
Do something, brother.

435
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:05,302
Look, patience is the key for everything.

436
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,123
Trust me and be patient for few more days.

437
00:38:09,881 --> 00:38:11,974
Everything will come into our hands.

438
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:16,918
I'll take the party as well as 
every one of you, forward.

439
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,995
Tell the same to all our people.

440
00:38:47,331 --> 00:38:49,473
Rama, do something.

441
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:53,133
I wasn't able to bear when 
he was making fun of me.

442
00:38:53,713 --> 00:38:56,494
When he is going against 
me, I wasn't able to tolerate.

443
00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:00,058
Brother, when you, being a 
leader, is saying like this...

444
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:05,872
Rama, I never missed 
any opportunity till now.

445
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:10,767
I've backstabbed the 
chief by using Parvathy.

446
00:39:11,938 --> 00:39:17,923
Why go that far? I have even 
backstabbed the people of Telangana,

447
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:21,379
by grabbing lands in 
the name of Hitech city.

448
00:39:22,472 --> 00:39:26,564
I know very well what it 
is to be in power and

449
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:29,516
its pride, Rama.

450
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:36,308
But do you know who has backstabbed 
me even after having done these things?

451
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:37,774
It is the God.

452
00:39:39,303 --> 00:39:42,908
God gave me a fool as my child and

453
00:39:43,128 --> 00:39:46,124
backstabbed me.

454
00:39:48,006 --> 00:39:53,814
Whenever he goes into his room and 
weeps by covering himself in a blanket,

455
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:56,806
I'm dying because of that, Rama.

456
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,221
Brother, don't worry.

457
00:40:05,297 --> 00:40:06,749
Don't even think of being haste.

458
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:14,883
I'll see that I'll stomp him 
so deep that he can't get up,

459
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,321
and make the junior as CM.

460
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:21,997
Trust me.

461
00:40:23,261 --> 00:40:24,590
I'm with you.

462
00:40:35,635 --> 00:40:39,396
As per Dayaneni Rama's vow to Mr Babu,

463
00:40:39,489 --> 00:40:44,171
he thought of ways to bring

464
00:40:44,247 --> 00:40:46,559
terrible negativity about 
the incumbent governemnt.

465
00:40:47,368 --> 00:40:53,276
On the other side, the CM is 
busy with his government work,

466
00:40:53,352 --> 00:40:55,724
without bothering about the terrible 
plots that are being hatched behind him.

467
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,276
To claim that the accusations 
of Jagannath and his minsters

468
00:40:59,092 --> 00:41:03,380
regarding the Polavaram project to be 
wrong, I've called for this press meet

469
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,500
to answer him in a such way that 
he wouldn't question anymore.

470
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,636
Because there is need for the 
people to know the truth today.

471
00:41:12,836 --> 00:41:15,960
There might be 23 of 
our MLAs in the assembly.

472
00:41:16,506 --> 00:41:17,637
But,

473
00:41:17,729 --> 00:41:22,905
there are some crores of Velugu Desam 
warriors outside who are still alive.

474
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:25,779
What's with defeat? 
[scoffs]

475
00:41:26,342 --> 00:41:30,038
It is like summer season. 
It won't be permanent. [clears throat]

476
00:41:31,485 --> 00:41:34,204
This is the letter given by the department 
officer of the Polarvaram project

477
00:41:34,467 --> 00:41:37,675
stating that it need not be stalled.

478
00:41:39,492 --> 00:41:44,359
This is the letter given by the special 
officer and the chief officer stating

479
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,080
that no fraud had happened in 
the investments of that project.

480
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:57,229
Jagannath Reddy, mend your ways 
and behaviour at least now.

481
00:41:58,372 --> 00:42:04,335
[music mutes whispering]

482
00:42:23,795 --> 00:42:25,332
Respected people, 
I have a question.

483
00:42:26,804 --> 00:42:31,249
When the rowdies who are litterally 
illiterate entered the assembly and

484
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:38,005
speaking obnoxiously to a populist leader 
who is having 40 years of experience

485
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:40,745
and making fun of him,

486
00:42:41,257 --> 00:42:45,938
the CM laughed along with them instead of 
chiding them.

487
00:42:45,946 --> 00:42:50,672
Is that assembly etiquette? 
I'm asking this question to the public.

488
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:57,037
When the people voted 
him and made him as the CM,

489
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:04,676
he demeaned that position 
and the assembly.

490
00:43:05,498 --> 00:43:07,994
This behaviour is very the deceitful.

491
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,744
The people would teach him a lesson.

492
00:43:11,846 --> 00:43:16,159
And we announce that we'll oppose this CM.

493
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:24,227
[camera clicks]

494
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:27,045
Isn't destroying public platforms same as

495
00:43:27,746 --> 00:43:31,174
destroying the sentiment of public?

496
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:36,427
Jagannath Reddy, 
the people are questioning.

497
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,760
Why did we start 'Anna Canteen'?

498
00:43:44,433 --> 00:43:48,485
To ensure that no poor man 
should starve and have good food.

499
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:50,207
You have scrapped that.

500
00:43:51,961 --> 00:43:57,392
How can you eat when you 
have hit on poor man's hunger?

501
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:04,010
We're ready to even 
sacrifice our lives for the people.

502
00:44:04,151 --> 00:44:08,816
Why aren't you providing food to the poor? 
Who has given you the right to scrap it?

503
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:11,232
You have pleaded the 
people to give you one chance,

504
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,621
made them vote to you and scrapped the 
scheme that provides food to the poor.

505
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:19,109
Jagannath Reddy, 
this is my warning to you.

506
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:23,114
Don't you make the poor people starve!

507
00:44:30,932 --> 00:44:36,443
Jagannath Reddy, 
you know better than everyone that

508
00:44:36,517 --> 00:44:39,037
you are afterall a CM due to EVM.

509
00:44:39,913 --> 00:44:43,005
Introspect yourself at least now.

510
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:47,351
Jagannath Reddy, your plots and 
conspiracies are coming to light now.

511
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:48,834
We'll annhilate you.

512
00:44:48,998 --> 00:44:52,294
No MLA of your party 
would come to assembly.

513
00:44:53,163 --> 00:44:57,049
Jagannath Reddy joined hands with those

514
00:44:57,373 --> 00:44:59,386
who have filed cases 
against the Polavaram project.

515
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:04,313
If we stay silent, the public 
would think that we've done wrong...

516
00:45:05,168 --> 00:45:09,589
Moreover, it is a cakewalk for 
them to cheat and betray people.

517
00:45:10,497 --> 00:45:15,025
People might believe that 
he is telling the truth.

518
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:16,519
I too feel the same.

519
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,487
Arrange for a press meet.

520
00:46:06,963 --> 00:46:08,719
[camera clicks]

521
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:46,343
It's been not even ten 
months that I've become the CM.

522
00:46:47,727 --> 00:46:53,682
And within this time, there are a hell lot 
of accusations on me by the opposition.

523
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,788
They claim that I'm trying to 
stall the Polavaram project.

524
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:00,478
The Polavaram project 
is my father's dream.

525
00:47:01,287 --> 00:47:02,680
Will I stall that?

526
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,629
They claim that I've 
admitted rowdies in my party

527
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,885
and made them sit in the assembly.

528
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:15,131
My party has the most number of 
educated leaders in this country.

529
00:47:16,278 --> 00:47:18,104
Another surprising accusation is that,

530
00:47:18,996 --> 00:47:21,256
they claim that I'm making taking 
away the food from the poor man.

531
00:47:21,351 --> 00:47:26,128
When his government who never 
bothered about the farmers

532
00:47:26,448 --> 00:47:27,611
is accusing me about this, I feel sad.

533
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:29,800
They've been accusing me 
of crimes on hourly basis.

534
00:47:32,985 --> 00:47:36,143
Some of them are accusing that me 
and men are behind every murder

535
00:47:36,299 --> 00:47:40,080
and every crime that 
took place in the state.

536
00:47:41,212 --> 00:47:45,187
My silence doesn't 
mean that those are true.

537
00:47:45,652 --> 00:47:49,225
I'm not paying heed to the 
street dogs that are barking.

538
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:52,067
When you blabber 
something about me from now,

539
00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:01,006
don't forget that I'm 
living in Vijayawada too.

540
00:48:06,256 --> 00:48:12,203
[music mutes voice]

541
00:48:54,841 --> 00:48:58,836
We got the power but we 
couldn't get grip in the capital.

542
00:48:59,627 --> 00:49:01,523
Their reign is still running.

543
00:49:04,073 --> 00:49:05,923
We have to do something big for that,

544
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,307
so that the state would 
be inclining towards us.

545
00:49:10,786 --> 00:49:11,810
That freaking Rama...

546
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:16,733
He is blabbering about our leader.

547
00:49:17,736 --> 00:49:19,818
If we kill him...

548
00:49:19,993 --> 00:49:21,354
Obulu is right.

549
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:25,247
Killing 23 of them at once 
will get us rid of this mess.

550
00:49:25,728 --> 00:49:28,003
After that, 
we can concentrate on public service.

551
00:49:28,008 --> 00:49:30,291
What's this? What's he talking?

552
00:49:31,099 --> 00:49:32,210
What did our leader tell us?

553
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:38,003
Not with actions, but we should 
win over them with our counter words.

554
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:03,577
I've called you here to discuss 
an important thing with you.

555
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,842
Bezawada rowdy like you is 
the right person to deal with...

556
00:50:09,934 --> 00:50:11,189
...Kadapa factionists, Bhavani.

557
00:50:16,925 --> 00:50:20,806
The strength of my words aren't 
hitting enough to those people of Kadapa.

558
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:25,613
We have to deal with them 
in their very manner.

559
00:50:26,263 --> 00:50:27,899
I have an idea.

560
00:50:28,976 --> 00:50:34,326
We shall kill one of our men, 
create a fake witness

561
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:36,742
and frame the CM for that.

562
00:50:38,773 --> 00:50:40,025
How is the idea?

563
00:50:40,302 --> 00:50:41,028
Stop!

564
00:50:44,283 --> 00:50:46,796
Hey, what's the progress?

565
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:57,527
Hey...

566
00:50:59,464 --> 00:51:01,758
The murder which are getting it done

567
00:51:03,314 --> 00:51:05,629
should be highly confidential.

568
00:51:07,591 --> 00:51:10,927
Ensure that you arrange 
fool-proof witness and

569
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,567
see to that the CM gets the entire blame.

570
00:51:17,938 --> 00:51:19,545
Call me after the task gets finished.

with hundreds of people watching,

600
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:10,441
the TDP leader and the close 
associate of ex-CM of Andhra Pradesh,

601
00:55:10,485 --> 00:55:12,970
Dayaneni Rama was brutally murdered

602
00:55:13,025 --> 00:55:16,952
and this incident put the 
entire state in jitters.

603
00:55:17,168 --> 00:55:20,835
Even when no one knows 
who is behind this murder,

604
00:55:20,895 --> 00:55:25,832
the opposition ranted that it was 
the work of incumbent government.

605
00:55:25,862 --> 00:55:28,720
Not only that, the people of 
Obulu Reddy's caste and

606
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:33,039

In the last five weeks, this is the 
seventeenth murder in the state.

649
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,483
After this murder, there 
have been several murders

650
00:58:41,723 --> 00:58:43,866
around Vijayawada which 
are still unaccounted.

651
00:58:45,274 --> 00:58:48,138
The people are terrified even 
to enter into the capital city.

652
00:58:49,247 --> 00:58:52,648
We are mainly 
suspecting Kadapa's Obul Reddy

653
00:58:52,672 --> 00:58:55,976
and Bezawada's Gangaveeti.

654
00:58:57,457 --> 00:59:00,470
But they are currently in underground.

655
00:59:01,698 --> 00:59:04,106
I won't be questioning anyomore.

656
00:59:04,694 --> 00:59:07,111
I'll act. I'll act for sure.

657
00:59:08,223 --> 00:59:12,022
We thought rowdyism has been 
exterminated in Vijayawada.

658
00:59:12,312 --> 00:59:13,276
That's true.

659
00:59:13,886 --> 00:59:18,743
But rowdyism got exterminated 
and gave birth to factions.

Everyone is weeping. 
Don't you understand?

You might celebrate today as you've won.

662
00:59:26,537 --> 00:59:30,001
But tomorrow, 
I'll take everyone to task.

I'll make each of you sit, 
break your limbs and

670
01:00:40,525 --> 01:00:41,978
would he kill people?

671
01:00:42,738 --> 01:00:45,210
What kind of politics is this?

672
01:00:46,014 --> 01:00:47,404
All I say is this,

673
01:00:48,322 --> 01:00:51,511
Law and order became 
immaterial in Andhra Pradesh.

674
01:00:53,396 --> 01:00:56,226
AP became the state with 
the highest number of murders.

675
01:00:57,188 --> 01:00:59,416
I have only question for 
the central government.

676
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,497
Revoke the incumbent government.

677
01:01:03,816 --> 01:01:05,476
Conduct by-elections.

678
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:07,904
Given the current circumstances,

679
01:01:09,214 --> 01:01:11,128
The only one who can save AP,

680
01:01:11,917 --> 01:01:13,654
and take it forward is

681
01:01:13,938 --> 01:01:18,036
the Velugu Desam Party.

"There are no swords 
and blood splatter now"

689

"The methods of waging 
war has been changed now"

"A citizen is a king only till he votes"

691
01:02:34,796 --> 01:02:37,065
Why aren't you responding to the 
turmoil happening in the state?

692
01:02:37,165 --> 01:02:39,023
Since Dayaneni Rama is 
an opposition candidate,

693
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:40,837
are you trying to sidetrack the case?

694
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:46,946
No person involved in Dayaneni's 
murder case will be spared.

695
01:02:47,048 --> 01:02:48,782
As accused by former chief minister,

696
01:02:49,449 --> 01:02:53,052
be it my men or whoever it is.

697
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,876
It's on me that I'd see 
them get punishment lawfully.

698
01:02:58,431 --> 01:03:01,908
I'll arrange SIT team to probe this case

699
01:03:02,688 --> 01:03:04,133
and hand this over to the bureaucrats.

[music mutes voice]

702
01:03:36,637 --> 01:03:41,006
To unravel the mystery behind 
Dayaneni Rama's murder,

703
01:03:41,206 --> 01:03:44,580
a renowned officer who's been 
very knowledgeable about crime,

704
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,791
has been appointed as the chief officer 
of Special Investigation Team (SIT).

705
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:48,551
-Madam... 
-Madam, did you find any clues?

706
01:03:48,651 --> 01:03:50,402
Madam, how are you going 
to investigate this case?

707
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:55,614
As per standard investigation procedure.

708
01:03:56,138 --> 01:03:57,452
Madam, did you find any clues?

709
01:04:00,415 --> 01:04:02,091
Yeah. We've found a very important clue.

710
01:04:02,127 --> 01:04:03,705
Overlap of voices: What is it, 
madam? Tell us... Tell us...

711
01:04:05,167 --> 01:04:08,214
It is nothing but 
Dayaneni Rama's dead body.

712
01:04:08,713 --> 01:04:10,163
What's your next plan of action, madam?

713
01:04:15,076 --> 01:04:17,141
Umm... I'll think about post lunch.

714
01:04:17,218 --> 01:04:19,007
-Thank you very much. 
-Madam... Madam... One more question...

715
01:04:19,031 --> 01:04:21,459
Madam... [clamour]

is like a heroin 
in the item number.

721
01:04:48,411 --> 01:04:53,842
What can she do to me, who is the 
reigning rowdy of the entire Vijayawada?

722
01:04:54,042 --> 01:04:57,214
[laughs]

[door creaks open]

724
01:05:14,775 --> 01:05:16,610
I'm the nightmare to the rowdies.

The item has begun, shall we leave?

726
01:05:19,678 --> 01:05:20,924
Hey, what the hell are you talking?

-Move... 
-Hmm...

730
01:05:42,464 --> 01:05:43,033
Move, rascal...

731
01:06:07,408 --> 01:06:09,709
Ram Gopal Varma has tweeted again,

732
01:06:10,152 --> 01:06:11,407
but he was prasining, this time.

733
01:06:12,194 --> 01:06:13,326
-Praising us? 
-Hmm...

734
01:06:14,078 --> 01:06:15,231
Well, what was his tweet?

735
01:06:19,757 --> 01:06:22,732
To pervert people like me who 
considers a woman as a mere sex symbol,

736
01:06:22,832 --> 01:06:24,291
you have given a 
tight-slap by appointing...

737
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:27,207
...a powerful woman officer Swapna

738
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:30,060
as the SIT officer to probe Dayaneni 
Rama's murder and I congratulate

739
01:06:30,147 --> 01:06:33,427
RCV party for doing that.

740
01:06:33,636 --> 01:06:34,171
Huh!

741
01:06:34,376 --> 01:06:38,673
No one knows when and whose side 
that bugger Ram Gopal Varma takes.

742
01:06:38,884 --> 01:06:39,640
Don't trust him.

743
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:45,008
Everyone thinks 'changing sides' 
is done only by politicians.

744
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:51,756
But Ram Gopal Varma was 
born with this quality.

745
01:06:53,126 --> 01:06:55,829
Sometimes, he says he is adoring a woman

746
01:06:56,235 --> 01:06:58,011
and sometimes, he says she's 
just a mere sex symbol.

747
01:06:58,149 --> 01:07:00,760
We don't understand if he 
is praising or chiding.

748
01:07:01,049 --> 01:07:02,712
We've already got hell lot of problems.

749
01:07:03,727 --> 01:07:04,953
We don't want this to add to our woes.

750
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:07,080
[dials] Forget it.

751
01:07:52,012 --> 01:07:53,380
Can I go now?

752
01:07:56,234 --> 01:07:58,801
Are you Bezawada's rowdy?

753
01:07:59,428 --> 01:08:00,098
Hmm...

754
01:08:02,692 --> 01:08:04,883
Do I look a heroine in the item number?

755
01:08:05,284 --> 01:08:06,025
Hmm...

756
01:08:08,379 --> 01:08:11,871
I'm the one who has started rowdyism by 
discontinuing schooling at 10th division.

757
01:08:12,164 --> 01:08:15,677
My brother told me it was a wrong path, 
hence I've entered the film industry.

758
01:08:15,882 --> 01:08:16,693
Remember something.

759
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:18,729
I'm not new to Rowdyism.

760
01:08:19,104 --> 01:08:21,463
Well... Do you think I'll 
get terrified by you?

761
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:24,335
Women have applied warrior tilak 
on my forehead and sent me here.

762
01:08:24,568 --> 01:08:25,509
Why will I get scared by you?

763
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:28,499
Your... police might fail...

764
01:08:29,243 --> 01:08:30,480
Your government might fail.

765
01:08:31,059 --> 01:08:32,621
Law... Even law might fail...

766
01:08:32,963 --> 01:08:34,134
But I won't fail.

767
01:08:35,108 --> 01:08:36,460
This is my warning to all of you.

768
01:08:36,842 --> 01:08:39,262
This is my warning to 
everyone who does rowdyism.

769
01:08:39,451 --> 01:08:41,552
If you try to do rowdyism from now,

770
01:08:42,065 --> 01:08:43,970
I'll strip you and whip you!

771
01:08:44,179 --> 01:08:46,758
-People sloganeering: Jai VDP 
-We've seen their faction history till now

772
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:50,029
But now, we're seeing 
their faction politics.

773
01:08:51,053 --> 01:08:54,089
He came to our place, 
he made his men do this murder and

774
01:08:54,473 --> 01:08:56,458
set up an enquiry committe to probe it.

775
01:08:56,987 --> 01:09:02,304
He's our party worker who is very naive.

776
01:09:02,504 --> 01:09:04,926
Gangaveeti Bhavani is a very good man that

777
01:09:05,513 --> 01:09:07,901
he joined in our party

778
01:09:08,076 --> 01:09:11,490
despite knowing that we're behind 
his father Gangaveeti Ganga's murder.

779
01:09:12,908 --> 01:09:14,779
Mr Chinna Babu, you 
shouldn't talk about such things.

780
01:09:15,544 --> 01:09:17,313
-Oh damn! 
-You might be thinking that we'll stay mum

781
01:09:17,539 --> 01:09:20,097
if you abuse your power 
on these innocent people.

782
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:22,784
They still don't know what 
kind of a person my father is.

783
01:09:22,948 --> 01:09:26,314
"He can take it if you slap him"

784
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:33,113
"He can withstand it if 
you kick him in his loins"

785
01:09:36,585 --> 01:09:39,862
"He can take it if you slap him"

786
01:09:40,608 --> 01:09:43,367
"He can withstand it if 
you kick him in his loins"

787
01:09:43,395 --> 01:09:48,623
"But if you mess with his ego"

788
01:09:48,908 --> 01:09:52,246
-"He'll kill you!" 
-"He'll kill you!"

789
01:09:52,374 --> 01:09:55,661
-"He'll kill you!" 
-"He'll kill you!"

-"He'll kill you... Babu will kill you..." 
-"He'll kill you... Babu will kill you..."

791
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:10,741
"He can take it if you slap him"

"He can withstand it if 
you kick him in his loins"

793

"He'll kill you... He'll kill you... 
He'll kill you..."

794
01:10:28,242 --> 01:10:34,102
"Oh no! He'll kill you... Oh no! 
He'll kill you..."

795
01:10:42,242 --> 01:10:45,018
"When a guy younger than 
him is making fun of him"

796
01:10:45,684 --> 01:10:48,781
"and his several years of experience"

797
01:10:52,436 --> 01:10:55,546
"When he's getting 
taunted by unexpected things"

798
01:10:55,984 --> 01:10:58,898
"and dirt is thrown on him"

"He will wait, plot a sketch"

"and wait for right time to back-stab"

801
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:09,283
"He prays to God to bless him 
with a day where he digs ditch"

802
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:12,820
-"He'll kill you!" 
-"He'll kill you!"

803
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:16,046
-"He'll kill you!" 
-"He'll kill you!"

804
01:11:16,495 --> 01:11:21,614
-"He'll kill you... Babu will kill you..." 
-"He'll kill you... Babu will kill you..."

805
01:11:21,655 --> 01:11:24,492
"When he gets a humiliating defeat"

806
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:27,916
"When he is made to sweat and run"

807
01:11:31,877 --> 01:11:34,734
"When all his hopes to lay hands 
on the money are made to shatter"

808
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:38,340
"When his very own people ditch him"

809
01:11:38,858 --> 01:11:41,772
"He will plot a plan. 
He'll come up with a scheme"

810
01:11:42,225 --> 01:11:45,282
"He lays a trap with 
his unbelievable moves"

811
01:11:45,483 --> 01:11:47,333
"He'll make a map to annihilate 
all his enemies"

812
01:11:47,492 --> 01:11:49,012
"till the last remaining 
person of their family"

813
01:11:49,212 --> 01:11:52,229
-"He'll kill you!" 
-"He'll kill you!"

814
01:11:52,494 --> 01:11:55,695
-"He'll kill you!" 
-"He'll kill you!"

815
01:11:55,895 --> 01:12:01,017
-"He'll kill you... Babu will kill you..." 
-"He'll kill you... Babu will kill you..."

816
01:12:07,622 --> 01:12:09,059
I've never seen or

817
01:12:09,315 --> 01:12:14,161
heard of this kind tawdry 
politics in the last 127 years.

818
01:12:14,362 --> 01:12:16,340
Stooping to low level of politics!

819
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:20,534
People and democracy have 
become like cheap things to

820
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,356
this government.

821
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:23,692
They're considering it as a joke.

822
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:25,100
I have only one thing.

823
01:12:25,783 --> 01:12:30,381
The CM failed to nab the culprits 
in Dayaneni Rama's murder case.

824
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,966
He has to resign immediately.

825
01:12:32,435 --> 01:12:33,415
Otherwise...

826
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,817
People: You'll strip 
everyone and whip them.

827
01:12:36,017 --> 01:12:36,510
Yes.

828
01:12:36,905 --> 01:12:39,049
Madam, what's the status of 
the probe in Rama's murder?

829
01:12:41,131 --> 01:12:42,704
What's the progress of the 
probe in Rama's murder, madam?

830
01:12:44,084 --> 01:12:45,530
In the murder case of 
Dayaneni Rama, we've suspected

831
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:50,406
Gangaveeti Bhavani, the history 
sheeter of Bezawada and arrested him.

832
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,261
When are you going to present the 
culprits in front of media, madam?

833
01:12:54,785 --> 01:12:56,337
When are you going to present 
them in front of media, madam?

834
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:57,290
Hmm...

835
01:12:57,815 --> 01:13:00,597
But... He has escaped from 
the police custody last night.

836

Are you fooling people?

SIT became the lapdog 
of the chief minister.

They are cooking up 
stories citing he has escaped!

840
01:13:13,562 --> 01:13:15,333
The truth is that

841
01:13:15,902 --> 01:13:20,757
they have killed him by torturing him in 
the SIT custody and vanished the body.

842

I won't spare the government,

843
01:13:24,123 --> 01:13:25,855

What's your say on this?

My history tell us what we are.

850
01:14:38,889 --> 01:14:42,286
Though my grandfather got 
murdered in the faction mess,

my father told us to refrain from the 
vengeance which everyone knows.

We have the habit of doing 
anything in a straight forward manner.

When that's how we do things, how do 
you think that we had vanished the body?

866
01:16:21,436 --> 01:16:25,417
Regarding Dayaneni Rama's murder,

867
01:16:26,555 --> 01:16:28,662
though the ex-CM Mr Babu is not behind it,

868
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,947
I can analyse for sure that

dangerous than fingerprints

some thousands of years ago.

If we put aside my analysis and

876
01:17:06,233 --> 01:17:08,663
think as per common man's sense,

877
01:17:08,838 --> 01:17:13,100
the VDP party's conspiracy behind 
this case is that

878
01:17:13,507 --> 01:17:16,620
they want to backstab RCV party.

879
01:17:16,919 --> 01:17:17,636
Is this true?

880
01:17:17,998 --> 01:17:20,709
This is my analysis for today.

01:17:21,617 --> 01:17:22,668
It might change tomorrow.

or did they kill him?

you don't know, brother?

905
01:19:25,781 --> 01:19:31,253
Minions like Jagannath, Babu, 
RCR Pranav Kalyan aren't my rivals.

and passports or ATM's.

1007
01:26:05,701 --> 01:26:07,637
our swords and were 
speaking in our accent.

1008
01:26:08,267 --> 01:26:09,818
And they've covered 
their faces with towels.

1009
01:26:12,185 --> 01:26:15,513
My 10 years of hard work has been 
ruined with just one swish of a sword.

1010
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:19,334
We're in a verge of losing the power

1011
01:26:20,197 --> 01:26:22,519
which we have earned with 10 
years of hard work within 10 months.

1012
01:26:23,265 --> 01:26:25,733
My fear is not about losing power.

1013
01:26:26,652 --> 01:26:28,423
I'm worried about 
losing the trust of people.

1014
01:26:29,732 --> 01:26:33,304
If it is the work of our men, 
the people would hit at us with footwear.

1015
01:26:35,464 --> 01:26:36,835
Call to our hometown

1016
01:26:37,638 --> 01:26:40,766
and enquire where they 
were at the time of murder.

1017
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:44,162
Tell them not to leave 
the town till I tell them.

1018
01:28:20,268 --> 01:28:20,977
Hmm...

1019
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:23,150
This twist is right.

1020
01:28:25,986 --> 01:28:29,746
Why should we care about what 
happens to the political leaders?

1021

1022
01:28:33,148 --> 01:28:35,325
If we join our hands,

1023
01:28:36,854 --> 01:28:38,447
we'll prosper.

01:28:39,303 --> 01:28:40,221

-Cheers.

-People sloganeering: Hail VDP! 
-In Dayaneni Rama's murder case,

1026
01:28:47,159 --> 01:28:49,854
we don't trust SIT officer's probe.

1027
01:28:49,974 --> 01:28:51,193
The SIT officers

1028
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:55,129
and the CM who got 
Gangaveeti Bhavani murdered

1029
01:28:55,876 --> 01:28:59,109
joined hands together and are 
ensuring that Obul Reddy is not traceable.

1030
01:28:59,293 --> 01:29:00,988
My question to the 
central government is that,

1031
01:29:01,938 --> 01:29:07,301
they should appoint CBI 
to investigate this case.

1032
01:29:08,769 --> 01:29:11,328
CBI investigation is 
necessary for this case.

1033

Babu's government toppled.

1034
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,957
If we topple the present chief minister,

1035
01:29:18,376 --> 01:29:23,652
our party flag would be flying 
in the next Andhra elections.

1036
01:29:24,777 --> 01:29:29,961
It is difficult for the people to trust 
the regional parties in this situation.

1037
01:29:30,455 --> 01:29:31,798
Arrange for the press meeting.

by the people of Andhra Pradesh

with a lot of trust,

1042
01:29:58,739 --> 01:30:02,278
the CM and his government

1043
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:07,511
have breached their 
trust within three months.

1044
01:30:08,005 --> 01:30:10,453
They have become a joke before the public.

1045
01:30:11,899 --> 01:30:14,393
They've ruined democracy.

1046
01:30:15,589 --> 01:30:18,651
My friends from Andhra Pradesh... 
I'm with you all.

1047

Don't be scared.

Presidential rule in Andhra Pradesh.

1049

Interim elections would be declared.

1050
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:35,005
I'm handing over the 
Rama murder case to CBI.

That guy RGV's latest tweet from Mumbai.

1052
01:30:39,974 --> 01:30:42,137
You've fired a beautiful 
lady like Swapna Kumari.

1053
01:30:43,038 --> 01:30:44,512
It's okay, it happens sometimes.

1054
01:30:45,531 --> 01:30:48,646
But you should've assigned 
someone more beautiful from the CBI.

1055
01:30:48,978 --> 01:30:50,221
This is my request to the government.

1056
01:30:51,973 --> 01:30:55,516
The entire state is on 
fire about this case...

1057
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:59,239
but this guy is just stuck 
at the beauty of ladies.

1058
01:31:00,453 --> 01:31:02,426
Well, he is a man who adores beauty!

1059

Enough, we too know how to.

-Of course!

with serial murders...

1062

thought everyone is waiting for it.

1063

In the murder case of Dayaneni Rama...

1064
01:31:16,113 --> 01:31:20,234
Chief Minister Jagannatha Reddy is 
being accused as the prime suspect.

1065
01:31:20,434 --> 01:31:23,655

his answer for this now.

has destroyed the democracy?

1070
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:24,838
We are asking just one 
thing to the police...

1071
01:44:28,295 --> 01:44:32,380
please revive the law. 
And work as per law.

1072
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:37,021
with this blow, the chief minister 
must go behind the bars again.

01:54:35,353 --> 01:54:39,795
that they were staying in a house in 
the same lane where Vijay Mallya stayed.

1174
01:54:39,995 --> 01:54:43,213
But when our representative spoke to them,

1175
01:54:43,413 --> 01:54:46,450
They said that they came to 
London just for the shopping.

1176
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:51,079
Amidst these confusing 
and chaotic twists...

1177
01:54:51,279 --> 01:54:55,860
and in these political chaos where no one 
knows what id the truth and what is not

1178
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:58,278
Where no one knows what 
happened or what did not happen...

1179
01:54:58,478 --> 01:55:00,827
Where no one has no 
clue what is happening...

1180
01:55:01,027 --> 01:55:03,638
But what are people actually believing...

1181
01:55:03,838 --> 01:55:08,500
Will be known only after 
these midterm elections.

1182
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:11,899
Your Rambabu, 
along with cameraman Manga.

1183
01:55:13,045 --> 01:55:15,807
AFTER MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

1184
01:55:16,107 --> 01:55:19,506
[crowd cheering]

1185
01:55:29,203 --> 01:55:31,474
I, PP John.

1186
01:55:34,068 --> 01:55:37,388
as the third chief 
minister of Andhra Pradesh

1187
01:55:37,588 --> 01:55:39,858
taking an oath.

1188
01:55:40,558 --> 01:55:45,275
As the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh,

1189
01:55:45,475 --> 01:55:50,983
the first sign I do is, 
that from here after...

1190
01:55:51,183 --> 01:55:53,718
there will be no 
elections once in 5 years.

1191
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:56,391
The next elections will be

1192
01:55:56,791 --> 01:56:02,358
only after I go to Jesus.

1193
01:56:02,576 --> 01:56:03,733
When?

1194
01:56:04,133 --> 01:56:10,098
Only after I go Jesus.

1195
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:12,464
God bless you!

1196
01:56:18,747 --> 01:56:21,332
Argh! Was that a dream?

1197
01:56:21,532 --> 01:56:23,634
There's no swearing ceremony?

1198
01:56:23,834 --> 01:56:26,845
Are there no prime 
ministers of 150 countries?

1199
01:56:27,045 --> 01:56:31,597
The votes that my crores of 
fans have voted is a dream?

1200
01:56:32,197 --> 01:56:34,692
Jyothi... Jyothi...

1201
01:56:35,566 --> 01:56:39,407
Damn, is this a dream? Is this a dream?

1202
01:56:39,607 --> 01:56:41,535
Is this a dream?

1203
01:56:41,735 --> 01:56:44,992
I, VS Jagannath Reddy...

1204
01:56:45,192 --> 01:56:47,851
affirm that I will bear true faith and 
allegiance to the Constitution of India

1205
01:56:49,018 --> 01:56:52,250
Putting all this aside, 
who killed Dayaneni Rama?

1206
01:56:58,482 --> 01:56:59,564
It's me!

1207
01:57:04,093 --> 01:57:06,131
Who the hell believes it? [scoffs]

1208
01:57:37,101 --> 01:57:40,218
Upon the unexpected 
consequences in the state...

1209
01:57:40,418 --> 01:57:42,936
let's find out RGV's response.

1210
01:57:43,136 --> 01:57:45,146
Namasthe RGV sir.

1211
01:57:46,973 --> 01:57:50,864
RGV sir, if you keep your phone 
aside we shall start the interview.

1212
01:57:52,907 --> 01:57:56,770
What is your opinion 
on these consequences?

1213
01:57:57,623 --> 01:58:00,142
In a way, I feel...

1214
01:58:00,342 --> 01:58:05,588
if I look into who all are involved 
in this scam with no partiality

1215
01:58:05,788 --> 01:58:09,243
who's behind this murder and all 
kinds of other crimes involved...

1216
01:58:10,011 --> 01:58:15,098
without considering 
them as his kith and kin...

1217
01:58:15,298 --> 01:58:19,277
he treated all of them equally.

1218
01:58:19,477 --> 01:58:23,399
without showing any mercy, 
punishing them without any bias

1219
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:25,015
is what I liked the most.

1220
01:58:25,215 --> 01:58:29,391
Don't you see clearly that you are biased?

1221
01:58:29,591 --> 01:58:33,485
I already told a lot of times, 
I am no way in favour of any party.

1222
01:58:33,685 --> 01:58:36,317
But this is the fact. You witness it.

1223
01:58:36,517 --> 01:58:39,637
-I mean everyone saw... 
-Tell me this Ram Gopal Varma sir...

1224
01:58:39,837 --> 01:58:45,019
Isn't this statement an example to say 
that you are in favour of that party?

1225
01:58:45,219 --> 01:58:50,555
No because, you just 
saw... in fact we all saw...

1226
01:58:50,755 --> 01:58:52,834
after the midterm election results...

1227
01:58:53,034 --> 01:58:55,079
Jagannath party has secured

1228
01:58:55,279 --> 01:59:00,823
151+23, 174 seats.

1229
01:59:01,106 --> 01:59:06,491
The whole Andhra Pradesh have 
a lot of faith on Jagannath.

1230
01:59:06,691 --> 01:59:09,426
There is no better proof 
than this. Isn't it?

1231
01:59:09,626 --> 01:59:12,932
Say don't say I am in 
favour of that party,

1232
01:59:13,132 --> 01:59:15,892
The whole Andhra Pradesh 
people spoke in favour of him.

1233
01:59:16,092 --> 01:59:19,970
The way he handled this 
scam, proved his integrity.

1234
01:59:20,170 --> 01:59:23,053
The whole nation is talking about it.

1235
01:59:23,253 --> 01:59:26,351
Moreover, a party securing 
174 out of 175 seats...

1236
01:59:26,551 --> 01:59:28,674
has never ever happened in world history.

1237
01:59:29,662 --> 01:59:33,167
But there's something 
surprising here that...

1238
01:59:33,367 --> 01:59:38,796
they secured 174 seats but Babu 
winning one seat is noteworthy.

1239
01:59:40,396 --> 01:59:43,142
But I feel that,

1240
01:59:45,895 --> 01:59:50,498
Babu is involved 
in Rama's murder.

1241
01:59:50,698 --> 01:59:54,999
How can you affirm that 
Babu is involved in it Mr RGV?

1242
01:59:55,199 --> 02:00:00,308
I didn't finish it. Though there 
are rumours that Babu is involved...

1243
02:00:01,477 --> 02:00:05,890
I think that we should 
think that the public think...

1244
02:00:06,090 --> 02:00:11,935
that it happened without 
Babu's knowledge.

1245
02:00:13,222 --> 02:00:16,155
Here is where I get confused...

1246
02:00:16,355 --> 02:00:19,785
Who do you think has murdered Rama?

1247
02:00:19,985 --> 02:00:25,069
I opine that the secrets 
behind Rama's murder...

1248
02:00:25,269 --> 02:00:28,852
will never ever be known 
to anyone. Because...

1249
02:00:29,052 --> 02:00:34,965
No one ever knows the final 
solution to the happenings in politics.

1250
02:00:35,165 --> 02:00:37,389
It just flows with time.

1251
02:00:38,262 --> 02:00:40,467
But coming to that point... the public

1252
02:00:40,667 --> 02:00:46,143
lack the interest to know 
the truth behind these and

1253
02:00:46,343 --> 02:00:49,350
rather find it interesting to discuss 
them in drawing rooms in the cities...

1254
02:00:49,901 --> 02:00:51,981
and under the trees if villages

1255
02:00:52,181 --> 02:00:56,056
They will have big 
discussions with their little brains.

1256
02:00:56,256 --> 02:01:00,762
They feel great about 
themselves and find happiness in that.

1257
02:01:02,184 --> 02:01:06,843
No matter what anyone 
says or tells or analyses

1258
02:01:07,043 --> 02:01:10,528
The one real truth which 
all have to accept is

1259
02:01:10,728 --> 02:01:14,820
whether in politics or cinema or 
media or anywhere for that matter...

1260
02:01:15,417 --> 02:01:18,916
All that people want 
is just entertainment.
