as a solvent in rubber industry...

5
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,785
Mother, please move little further...

6
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,815
Yes... don't move...

7
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,624
Aunty, don't give a wide grin...

8
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:48,759
It's enough if you just smile.

9
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,196
Father, atleast now,
smile a little...

10
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,369
Uncle, you also go and sit.

11
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,805
First take your parents photo...

12
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,367
Take your parents' photo.
- Uncle, you too go and stand.

13
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,867
Valliaya, come on... - I'm coming brother.

Sit down man... - Sit uncle.

Where is mother? - She was there...

17
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,184
Come on... grandma...
- No dear...

18
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,647
I say come...
- I won't.

19
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,550
Come on... grandma...
- Leave me.

20
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,622
<i>Hey, please leave her.
Why are you troubling this oldie?</i>

21
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,165
Aishwarya, what are you doing?

22
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,631
What are you doing?

23
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,733
Seeing family photo?!

24
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,130
During class hours...
sit down...

25
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,065
Damn it!

26
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,868
You come to school because
you are rich, right?

27
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,078
Students, you all listen
to the class.

28
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,798
Oh! Angel of God...
my Guardian dear.

29
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,101
To whom god's love commands me here.

30
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,242
Ever this day, be at my side.

31
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:52,975
To light and god.

32
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,214
...and great.

33
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,560
<i>Convent stop, get down.</i>

34
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:03,988
<i>Oldie, get down.</i>

35
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,055
<i>Start the bus.</i>

36
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,334
<i>Please buy tickets.</i>

37
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:11,829
<i>Give me change.</i>

38
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,004
<i>Ticket please...</i>

39
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:30,648
<i>Hail Lord Muruga!</i>

40
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,948
<i>Hey, it's unbearable.</i>

41
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,788
<i>They're frequently creating
traffic jam in the name of god.</i>

42
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,397
<i>Hail Lord Muruga!</i>

43
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,873
<i>Hey move away and stand.</i>

44
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,285
<i>Look, if you're leaving
your house and coming,</i>

45
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,288
<i>You shouldn't bring even
a speck from your house.</i>

46
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,996
<i>Would Muruga have
come by this time?</i>

47
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,140
Time is up.
She hasn't come yet.

48
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,976
She said that she'll
be here by 5pm.

49
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,050
She asked me to stand infront
of this shop only.

50
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,361
Will she come?

51
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,203
"The one who dives into the sea
will harvest pearls."

52
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,536
"The one who falls in love
will become a beggar."

53
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,872
Starting itself
isn't a good sign...

54
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,236
Can we believe her?

55
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,480
Shit! I shouldn't suspect my Ais.

56
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,813
It's a sin...
Muruga... it's a sin.

57
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,922
Why is he looking at me?

58
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,544
Give money...

59
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,280
Be fast...

60
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,080
Have it.

61
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,118
You stay here.

62
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,765
May I help you?

63
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,666
We've Chudies, Kurthas,
Short Kurthas...

64
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,470
and we've lots of models.

65
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,278
And I think this will
be better for you.

66
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,176
Oh Jeans?! Let me show you, madam.

67
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:27,032
<i>Hail Lord Muruga!</i>

68
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,196
Eat properly.

69
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,029
Don't roam here and there.

70
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,897
I'll go to the temple and come.

71
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,332
Take care of yourself.

72
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,337
I'll be back soon.
- Okay mother.

73
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,673
See you Muruga...

74
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:56,323
<i>Hail Lord Muruga...</i>

75
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,778
Give me the bill.
- Give me price tag.

76
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,419
I can bill only after seeing it.

77
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,650
Wait... let me cut it.

78
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,592
Excuse me...

79
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,790
You take bill this also.

80
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:37,765
Excuse me...

81
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:38,937
Sorry...

82
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,039
Please...

83
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,477
Thank you for coming!

84
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,501
That girl had left her
school uniform. - Is it?

85
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,270
Friend, here situation is worse.

86
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,469
How about there?

87
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,114
We'll send if we've
sufficient tickets, right?

88
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,147
Please hold on the line.
- Sir, when will bus to Madras come?

89
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,111
Boss, they've allotted
seat no: 15 & 16.

90
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,583
It's a special trip.
It's going to start now.

91
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,155
It has gone to pick up
a marriage group.

92
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,154
It'll be coming now.

93
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,656
We too have to full
the bus, haven't we?

94
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,522
It will come.
You go and have tea.

95
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,190
What's it? Has bus come?
Shall we go?

96
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,730
No. It seems it'll take time.

97
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,364
Would you like to have tea?
- Oh god!

98
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,299
That's why I suggested
to go in the morning.

99
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:47,939
You've said it suddenly...

100
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,300
I've to arrange for money, haven't I?

101
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,102
If money is problem for you,
you could've told me, right?

102
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:52,936
I would've brought it.

103
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,079
I loved only you,
not your money!

104
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,148
Nothing less in this!
Only I know my tension.

105
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,612
If anyone see us...

106
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,827
Oh god! Gone...
my uncle... - Where?

107
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:12,895
Opposite side...

108
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,366
Okay, you stay there.

109
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,503
Don't move...
stay there.

110
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:25,773
<i>He's going away.</i>

111
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,211
How long it will take?
- How do I know?

112
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,815
He only said that it'll
take some time.

113
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:35,111
Oh Muruga! I don't know how to
explain my situation.

114
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,614
Do you know how I am tensed
every minute I'm here?

115
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,890
I lied to my parents that
I'm attending a special class.

116
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,890
My grandma will shout
and gather crowd.

117
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,066
Aishwarya...

118
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,028
Where are her slippers?

119
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,304
It's getting late.
She's hasn't come home yet.

120
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,474
Hey, did my grandchild
tell you anything?

121
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,539
Without even putting lights,
what are they doing inside?

122
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,335
Why aren't you replying?

123
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,570
They are least bothered
about my grand daughter.

124
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,113
<i>They are not worried
about my grand child.</i>

125
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,883
Don't you care about your child?
She hasn't come yet!

126
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,651
Hey elder daughter-in-law,
can't you hear me?

127
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:17,926
Where has my grand daughter gone?

128
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,928
They are not searching
my grand daughter.

129
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,230
My grand daughter's slippers are missing.

130
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,026
They haven't switched
on the lights...

131
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,703
Hey foolish women,
what are you doing inside?

132
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:30,101
Sister, she's shouting for
a long time. Control her.

133
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,777
Two foolish women are
keep on watching T.V.

134
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,277
I'll go and fix her up
that deaf oldie...

135
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,746
I'll close your mouth
with a big stone!

136
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,580
Didn't she say she will come
late after her special class?

137
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,278
Then why are you shouting?

138
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,147
Is she your daughter?
Did you give birth to her?

139
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,017
Don't we know to search her?

140
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,523
So, do you have to
stick to that idiot box?

141
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,557
Why are you always watching T. V?

142
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,491
You're blind and deaf...

143
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,187
You don't even allow us to watch TV.

144
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,366
<i>You are good for nothing!</i>

145
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,397
All are dying in
the world except you!

146
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,297
You're hale and healthy!

147
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,200
Let both of your husbands come...

148
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,898
I'll fix you up later.
- Let's see!

149
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,904
Today I'll put an end to this.
Whether I or you should be here.

150
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,478
Hey you foolish women...

151
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:11,647
<i>This house got ruined the moment
you both stepped in.</i>

152
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,478
Have they joined together?

153
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,119
Don't disturb me! Watch...

154
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,846
They're crook.
They're sticking on to the T.V.

155
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:24,124
These two devils are
spoiling the family!

156
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,502
Sir, give me Rs.30.

157
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,671
Hey marriage group,
give me Rs.1400.

158
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,499
For what? All of you get up.

159
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,504
<i>You're changing the
rates frequently.</i>

160
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,676
<i>What's your idea?</i>

161
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,505
<i>There's T. V., push back seat, right?
Talk sensibly.</i>

162
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,338
We don't want all that.

163
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,673
I'll pay the fare,
we'd decided earlier.

164
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,850
<i>Okay, go...
- Don't talk too much.</i>

165
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,348
<i>Hey, start the vehicle.
Time is up.</i>

166
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,679
Okay, sit down...
Hey, start the vehicle.

167
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,515
<i>Wait... it'll start...</i>

168
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,705
I'm much better than him.

169
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,720
Watch the movie.

170
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,050
Our leader's acting is superb.

171
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,223
Ais, why're you crying?

172
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:37,225
Ais, am I not asking you
why are you crying?

173
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,068
Look, tell me why are you crying?

174
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,534
Hey, 28! Give me the balance.
- Are you getting scared?

175
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,175
Okay, shall we get down?

176
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,178
Why do you think like this?

177
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,376
I never stayed away from
my parents even for a day.

178
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,581
That's why I'm crying.

179
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,188
I too never stayed away
from my mother.

180
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,118
Atleast you've a family of
aunty, uncle and grandma...

181
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,492
I've no one other than my mother.

182
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,390
I've left her alone
and come with you.

183
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,390
No use of thinking
about them now.

184
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,426
You wanted me to marry you
eloping to the city.

185
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,698
What am I to do
for you to stop crying?

186
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,765
Can't I even cry?

187
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,600
I'm also a human being, right?

188
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,970
Am I used to all this?

189
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,679
Am I eloping with someone everyday?

190
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,676
Am I eloping with
a girl everyday then?

191
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,678
I'm also new to this.

192
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,320
I'm also scared like you.

193
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,955
I can be brave only when you are.

194
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:34,556
If it's not possible for you,

195
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,126
Come, let's go straight to your father
and tell him about our love.

196
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,061
Have you gone mad?

197
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,627
Are you talking seriously?

198
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,531
If my father comes to know this,
we'll be dead.

199
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,531
First you marry me.

200
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,609
Then we'll go and see how they react.

201
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,802
If you tie her the knot,
will you become her husband?

202
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,909
Shouldn't you've to see
status, money and caste?

203
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,619
Buddy, why there is
so much of crowd?

204
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,654
We'll drink it inside.
Come on...

205
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:09,891
Brother, we've to drink it inside.

206
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,289
Please wait for half an hour.

207
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,092
That daughter's father
doesn't like you.

208
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,136
You give a written statement saying,
you've no connection with that girl.

209
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,271
Why should I?

210
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,468
I've married that girl
with her acceptance.

211
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:24,903
When you work as
a driver in a house,

212
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,771
you should mind only your business.

213
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,204
First that girl only
gave me the love letter.

214
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,507
What you should have done...

215
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,684
You should've told her
father, shouldn't you?

216
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,748
He gave you a job trusting you, right?

217
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,853
Aren't you getting your
monthly salary from him?

218
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,486
You should be loyal to him, shouldn't you?

219
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,852
Okay forget it.
Let bygones be bygones.

220
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,586
There is no use of
discussing about it now.

221
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,255
Give all the things and letters
which that girl had given to you.

222
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,262
After submitting them,

223
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,403
sign this stating
you've no link with her.

224
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,367
Then take as much money as you
want and leave the place.

225
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,040
We're married legally.

226
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,232
Don't try to split us with money.

227
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,370
No, it'll not work out.

228
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,842
Who are you to ask me?

229
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,780
You sign the papers.
- I can't.

230
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,452
I can't write and give you.

231
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:15,321
Hey, put your signature...
sign it...

232
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:20,061
Oh god! - Put your sign...

233
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,733
Sister, it's him...
talk to him... talk...

234
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,924
Who is it on the line?
- It's me only.

235
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,331
How many times I had told you
not to call me in office?

236
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,334
Tell me what's the matter?

237
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,400
Our daughter who had
gone to the school...

238
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,233
Tell me...

239
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,069
She is missing!
- What do you mean?

240
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:36,873
Are you joking?

241
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,982
She went saying special class...

242
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,275
but hasn't come home yet.

243
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,680
Hey Valli...
- What's it? Sister.

244
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:42,911
Are they both at home?

245
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,683
Yes. This oldie is shouting
since evening...

246
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,291
What are they doing inside?

247
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,892
This Oldie hasn't
stopped lamenting.

248
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,531
Is this a new thing?
Oldie always behaves like this only.

249
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,725
No sister. Her shouts,

250
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,369
indicate something
has happened there.

251
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,835
Really? - Her grand daughter
hasn't come home yet.

252
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,444
Looking at this man, it seems
something has happened there.

253
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,114
Oh god! That Killer has come!

254
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,373
I don't know what's going to happen!

255
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,952
Hey, Rajendra, these 2 devils
have lost my grand child.

256
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,349
You both are standing here,

257
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,714
can't you take care
of your only daughter?

258
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,324
What else you do here?

259
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,653
Where has she gone?

260
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,625
I'll kill you. Tell me...

261
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,523
Where is our daughter?
- Please leave us...

262
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,325
I'm asking you, am I not?
Tell me...

263
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,331
The way he's beating them,

264
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,696
It seems it's true that
his daughter has eloped...

265
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,735
Where she has gone? Tell me...

266
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,032
Oh god! Don't beat us.

267
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:39,039
There he has come.
Let's disperse.

268
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,440
Tell me...

269
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,314
Tell me...
- Oh no!

270
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:48,978
Tell me...

271
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,918
Losing your daughter,
you're simply sitting here...

272
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,720
I'll kill both of you.

273
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,323
Leave me...

274
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,698
I say leave me...

275
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,329
Brother, stop it... - Leave me.

276
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,262
I'll rest only after
killing them.

277
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,230
Hey move away...
move away...

278
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,773
Will we get our daughter,
if we beat them?

279
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,410
There's no use of
getting angry in this.

280
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:14,473
We should have patience.

281
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:16,545
Only then, we can take a decision.

282
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,340
This is a matter
concerning a girl.

283
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,650
We should solve it secretly.

284
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,021
You may announce with your shouts
that your daughter has eloped.

285
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,085
Be calm.

286
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,222
First let's find her.

287
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,483
Come on...

288
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:29,891
Come on brother...

289
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:30,818
Come on...

290
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,983
Look at his moustache...
like a caterpillar.

291
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,148
Sorry dear!

292
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,657
I scolded you thinking
about my parents.

293
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,060
You're very short tempered!

294
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,154
Dirty boy!

295
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,295
How did you enter my heart?

296
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,462
<i>Hey Ais, don't want...</i>

297
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,504
<i>Listen to me... hey...</i>

298
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,505
<i>Hey Revathi, spill it on her...</i>

299
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,037
<i>Hey don't run...</i>

300
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,871
<i>Hey stop... you spilt on me, right?</i>

301
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,820
Hey are you all girls?

302
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,557
Can't you hear the
sound of a bike?

303
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,586
If you had blown horn,
we would've given you space.

304
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,095
If I had, I would've
blown horn, right?

305
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,597
You should have horn, right?

306
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,325
This bike's owner didn't
install a horn, right?

307
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:45,230
Stop it man!

308
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,462
You're talking high
driving a borrowed bike?

309
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,608
Borrowed bike? We test ride
on this road only.

310
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,744
Did you find only this
road for test rides?

311
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:57,915
Push it...

312
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,550
Hey push it fast...

313
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,618
Hey, how did you talk like him?
- Then what else can I do?

314
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,288
Hey look at there, post box scene!

315
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,320
Hey, tease someone else!

316
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,552
<i>Where did I meet him again?</i>

317
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,489
<i>That day in the signal...</i>

318
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,540
<i>Why is your vehicle going
like a bullock cart?</i>

319
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,539
Are you going to change the Madras
by quickly going there?

320
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:30,740
Hey no... - What no?

321
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:31,745
Hey buddy, will we reach there on time?

322
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,273
Show ' STOP'... not there...
This side...

323
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,380
Oh god! They've fallen down!

324
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,181
Oh god!

325
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,448
Why are you going over
speed on your bike?

326
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,182
Can't you come slowly?

327
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,156
Go and take a look...
It may lead to a traffic jam.

328
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,056
Clear them.

329
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,256
Hey, I'll give you nicely...

330
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,893
Are you in a race?
Get up man.

331
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,860
When she shows 'STOP',
won't you stop?

332
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:53,727
Get up...

333
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,338
What are you going to do
driving so fast?

334
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,371
Sir, I'm going to Madras
to seek a job.

335
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,907
My friend came to see me off.

336
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,237
<i>Hey go fast...</i>

337
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:03,539
<i>It may lead to a traffic jam.</i>

338
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,374
Look how she's laughing?

339
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,144
Look at her face.

340
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,651
One day you'll fall.

341
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,047
That day I'll fix you up!

342
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,627
When did we meet again?

343
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,462
Why are you looking dull?

344
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:31,032
I'm feeling shy.
- Why?

345
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,608
Hey keep quiet...
- Why?

346
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:33,971
You won't know all these things.

347
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,339
What I don't know?!

348
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:36,980
You know certain things
only on coming of age.

349
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,809
What do you mean?

350
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,380
Tell me...

351
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,745
You won't understand
all these things.

352
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:42,885
You'll know it when you should.

353
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:47,316
Hey...

354
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,692
Look there...

355
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,928
Brother, get up...

356
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,496
Brother, get up...

357
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,899
Why did you take the stool?
You dog...

358
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,336
Get lost!
- Oh god!

359
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,202
Run away...

360
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,306
I'll kill you!

361
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:08,838
Bye.
- Bye.

362
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,242
Tomorrow don't fail to bring Maths book.
- Okay.

363
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:04,794
You've the fear, haven't you?

364
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:06,700
That day you were laughing...

365
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,697
Are we look like fools?

366
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,100
You show your arrogance
to someone else!

367
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,307
Are you behaving like a girl?

368
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,037
Shouldn't you behave decently?

369
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,145
Look at your stupid face and looks!

370
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,180
Aren't you ashamed?

371
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,646
If you play with us,
you'll be clean bowled.

372
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,419
Be careful!

373
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,159
What did I do now?
Why is he scolding me like this?

374
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,696
Come my dear grand child.
- Go grandma.

375
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,499
Why are you getting angry?
Hey what happened?

376
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,435
Dear, have this milk.
- I don't want anything!

377
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,010
Please dear, have this milk.
- Didn't I say no?

378
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,443
Why are you simply going away
without listening her?

379
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,479
Have the milk.

380
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,953
Shit! Rascal! I'll...

381
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,756
Are you behaving like a girl?

382
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,191
Ais, I'm telling you, isn't it?

383
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,862
Please have a little milk.
You're my dear, aren't you?

384
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,997
Oh no! Mother, please leave me alone!

385
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,599
Show your arrogance
to someone else!

386
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,708
Are you behaving like a girl?
Aren't you ashamed?

387
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,242
What happened to her?

388
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,780
Ais, have this milk.

389
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,113
How many times I've to tell
that I don't want milk?

390
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,389
Your father is on the line.
Talk to him.

391
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,890
Have you informed him so soon?

392
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,891
It seems you refused to
take your milk...

393
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:39,288
Nothing like that father.

394
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:40,327
What happened to you?

395
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,124
Did your teacher abuse you?

396
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:43,061
No father.

397
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,063
Did any of your friends scold you?

398
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:45,895
No father.

399
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,036
Did your aunty scold you?

400
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:47,966
Not at all father.

401
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,672
Did any boy teased you?

402
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,569
Hey tell me whatever it is...

403
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,141
I'll rip apart and chew them.

404
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:55,637
No father...

405
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:56,606
Shall I come there?

406
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,874
No need father.
I'll have my milk.

407
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,084
Then you have your milk and study.

408
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,578
I'll come now. - Okay.

409
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,919
Have it.
- You'll obey only your father.

410
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,085
You arrogant girl!

411
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,756
Oh no! Mother...

412
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,656
What happened to my daughter?

413
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,226
Mother...
- Ais... oh god!

414
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:18,593
Dear, what happened to you?

415
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,169
My dear, what happened?

416
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,019
<i>Oh sister Karuppayee...

417

<i>Oh sister Karuppayee...

00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,394
<i>Oh beautiful girl has come to age!</i>

419
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,892
<i>And she's entering the hut.</i>

420
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:58,472
<i>Like the harmonium,
Like the sound of music...</i>

421
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,976
<i>Like the harmonium,
Like the musical drums...</i>

422
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:07,475
<i>Your music is heard
all over the town.</i>

423
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:12,314
<i>Welcome to our function.</i>

424
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:18,224
<i>Welcome and bless this girl!</i>

425
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,267
<i>Sister Karuppayee...</i>

426
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,670
<i>Taking turmeric bath...</i>

427
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,003
<i>Oh beautiful girl has come to age!</i>

428
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,577
<i>And she's entering the hut.</i>

429
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,838
<i>By the sound of anklets,</i>

430
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,345
<i>By breaking the sand and stones,</i>

431
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,416
<i>The one who was dancing around,
has turned into a maiden.</i>

432
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,418
<i>Those who've seen the hall
of 1000 pillars in a half day,</i>

433
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:52,187
<i>lt'll take one month for them
to admire your beauty!</i>

434
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,957
<i>Fiance from Kutchanur has
come to build a hut for you.</i>

435
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,465
<i>Fiance from Usilampatti

436
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,298

437
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,127
<i>Fiance from Kallupatti
has brought with him for you.</i>

438
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,861
<i>You wear them and
show him your beauty.</i>

439
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,630
<i>He's eagerly waiting
for that only!</i>

440
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,573
<i>There're uncountable cash gifts...</i>

441
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,684
<i>There are innumerable goats
all over the place.</i>

442
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,480
<i>Whether it's mutton with rice
or rice with mutton...</i>

443
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,357
<i>on the dinning table,
people are in great confusion.</i>

444
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:14,268
<i>On the top of mango tree...</i>

445
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:19,610
<i>the one who attained puberty
and garlanded...</i>

446
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:27,350
<i>Your fiance wished
to marry you.</i>

447
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:31,994
<i>Let the function end
on a happy note!</i>

448
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,561
<i>Stop being a chatter box.</i>

449
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,365
<i>Stop your naughtiness!</i>

450
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,234
<i>If there's a flower,
bees will pay a visit. Mind it.</i>

451
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,073
<i>If you're a girl,
you should feel shy!</i>

452
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,701
<i>I blossomed at his first look!</i>

453
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:18,270
<i>I've hidden that moment
in my heart!</i>

454
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:22,776
<i>I considered myself a
child till yesterday!</i>

455
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:27,447
<i>I realized my age in his eyes!</i>

456
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:31,952
<i>I blossomed at his first look!</i>

457
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:36,454
<i>I've hidden that moment
in my heart!</i>

458
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:41,121
<i>I considered myself a
child till yesterday!</i>

459
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:46,233
<i>I realized my age in his eyes!</i>

460
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,005
<i>Stop roaming here and there.</i>

461
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,674
<i>Call me, when you
play a game of dice.</i>

462
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,270
<i>Don't sleep alone, remember it!</i>

463
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,174
<i>Keep your family god's
sacred ash on your forehead.</i>

464
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,701
This is the decent behavior
you'd expected of me, right?

465
00:32:58,409 --> 00:32:59,137
Now watch...

466
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,681
Why is he not caring me?

467
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:11,352
I abused her a lot... she's still
smiling like a mad girl.

468
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,284
Is she mad?

469
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:29,395
Long live... Long live...

470
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:33,801
What happened to me?

471
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,245
I'm always thinking about him!

472
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,031
I...

473
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,540
I'll not get separated from you.

474
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,140
I'll never leave you.

475
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:39,675
It's enough mother...

476
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:41,136
Wait...

477
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,471
Hey come on... come...

478
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,306
Ais, have you bought a scooty?

479
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:46,915
When did you buy? - Just now.

480
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,310
Hey, do you know to drive it? - Yes.

481

Thanks.

483
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,821
I'll go with her and come soon.

484
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,089
Hey Sathya, where are you going?

485
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,588
Thanks a lot for giving me
this new scooty to drive.

486
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:01,662
Okay drive carefully.

487
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,334
Hey, it's superb!

488
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,666
Shall I go fast?

489
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,131
Hey where are we going?

490
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,405
You keep moving... I'll tell you.

491
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,904
Tell me where are we going?

492
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,110
Turn right.

493
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:19,745
Stop it... stop it.

494
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,346
I'll... wait. Stop it.

495
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:24,483
Why?

496
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:35,963
Now you start.

497
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,466
It's not starting.

498
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,305
There's a workshop,
shall we go there?

499
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,173
Oh! Is that your plan?

500
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,208
Hey please, we'll go there.

501
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,443
Am I a pickle
for your intoxication!

502
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,018
I don't know where it is going to end!

503
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,910

504
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:02,552

00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,562
Hello, who's Durai here?

507
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:10,901
Our owner's name is Durai.

508
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:12,964
He never comes to the shop.

509
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,404
My brother manages everything!

510
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,574
Hello, I want to get
my bike repaired.

511
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,070
That too, the 'bike' wishes
it should be done by you.

512
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,849
Tell them that we're busy.
So we can't see to it now.

513
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,580
Why are they saying like this?

514
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:32,483
What can we do now?

515
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:36,821
Let's wait and see.
- We'll wait for you.

516
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,431
Ais, come on... come...

517
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:47,365
Sit down.

518
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,764
Today let's stay here itself.

519
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:52,503
Sit...

520
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,716
He is the one!

521
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:12,093
He is the one!

522
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,560
After repairing that bike,

523
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,026
he'll repair our...

524
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,132
No. He'll repair your bike.

525
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:20,732
Hey, don't pinch me.

526
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,734
He is the one!

527
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:29,279
Hey Ais, some one is calling you.

528
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,376
Hey, be quiet.

529
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,275
Are you giving ice to Ais...
we don't want.

530
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,550
Anyone else here want it?

531
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,952
Hey go and have a look...

532
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:38,814
Okay brother.

533
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,150
Brother, wire has come out.
- Hey, fix it and send them.

534
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,895
Why can't you fix it?
You've sent a small boy.

535
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,222
Hey be quiet.

536
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,989
Brother, I'm not able to fix it.
- Shit!

537
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:51,066
Hey move away.

538
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,209
Sir is expert workman!

539
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:00,639
Don't pinch me.

540
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:01,674
I'm not able to see anything.

541
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,913
I can't see it,
if he shows me a little...

542
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,847
Hey, ask them to take the vehicle.
- Okay brother.

543
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:10,782
Come, let's go.

544
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,686
Hey wait. Ask him to test drive
the vehicle and give.

545
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,695
Sir, she wants you to test drive
the vehicle and give.

546
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:19,521
Hey...

547
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:20,363
Shit!

548
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,668
<i>He is the one!</i>

549
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,603
<i>The one who comes in my dream!</i>

550
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,542
<i>The one who lives with my heart!</i>

551
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:39,306
<i>The one who mingled with my soul!</i>

552
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,109
<i>The one who dissolved with my age!</i>

553
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,777
<i>He is the one!</i>

554
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,648
<i>The one who smiles with my lips!</i>

555
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,552
<i>The one who wakes up in my nights.</i>

556
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,384
<i>The one who is craving
to be my life partner!</i>

557
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,391
<i>The one who bears my burden!</i>

558
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,724
<i>Will he lose himself
in the forest of my hair?</i>

559
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:59,391
<i>Is he the one who came
to disintegrate me?</i>

560
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:03,231
<i>Will he win over this
mad girl's heart?</i>

561
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,503
<i>By fulfilling my desires...</i>

562
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,075
<i>Will he stay with me throughout my life? I</i>

563
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,906
<i>He is the one!</i>

564
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:14,575
<i>He is the one who searches honey
in my flowers of full skirt.</i>

565
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,344
<i>Was he born to change my waning
moon into full moon?</i>

566
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:29,158
<i>Will he win over this
mad girl's heart?</i>

567
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,957
Hey, by asking me to
drive your new bike,

568
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,294
you pushed me down.

569
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,064
<i>Bus will stop here for 10 minutes.</i>

570
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,298
<i>You can have your tea and dinner.</i>

571
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,799
Move a little.

572
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,705
<i>Sir, what do you want?</i>

573
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,246
<i>Take the popcorn.</i>

574
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,486
Sir, take your coke and bun.

575
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:37,159
Brother, go that side!

576
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:54,509
Go...

577
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,353
Ais, have this cool drink.
- Don't want.

578
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,520
You didn't eat anything.

579
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:05,858
Atleast have this bun.

580
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:10,265
Don't want Muruga.
- Why? Angry on me?

581
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:12,860
Didn't I tell you I don't want?

582
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:45,894
Still angry on me?

583
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:51,070
If you fight with me,
who will you talk with?

584
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,419
How did she entered my heart?

585
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:14,591
I was my mother's son,
happy with my work.

586
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,646
Hello... hello...

587
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,153
Why are you going away
without taking money?

588
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:15,492
No need, forget it.

589
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,158
Then tell me where
you want to go,

590
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,692
I'll drop you there.

591
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,990
No need, you may go please.

592
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:22,491
Then, take service charge.

593
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,159
Please don't come near me.

594
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,164
Someone may see us.

595
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,997
I don't want free service.

596
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:30,366
You can ride the bike and
I'll sit on the pillion.

597
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,671
Please listen, go away.

598
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,677
For god's sake please go.

599
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,351
Scared?

600
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,013
Hey, Dirty boy!

601
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,516
You've become part of my life!

602
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,353
Nobody can split us apart.

603
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:09,269
Hey, dirty boy.

604
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,240
You've become part of my life!

605
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,382
Nobody can split us apart.
- Hey Wastrel! Watch your way!

606
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,249
Hey, dirty boy.

607
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:26,726
You've become part of my life!

608
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:50,920
Brother... it's petrol!

609
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,918
Hey Who is in the shop?

610
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,585
For vulcanizing tyre
in your shop...

611
00:44:56,794 --> 00:45:00,560
Don't get tensed sir. Brother run,
he's throwing things on us.

612
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:02,465
You get ruined!

613
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:07,103
<i>Don't ride too fast,
I'm sacred.</i>

614
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:08,635
<i>Hold me tight.</i>

615
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,439
<i>That's too much!</i>

616
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,373
<i>Ohl I've fallen down.</i>

617
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,606
<i>Didn't I tell you to
hold me tightly?</i>

618
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,939
<i>You dirty boy!</i>

619
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,273
What happened to you son?

620
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:19,779
Why are you lamenting?

621
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,777
Don't know what's his problem?

622
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:24,010
What happened?
Did you drink last night?

623
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,621
No mother.
- Drugs? - No mother.

624
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:28,584
I've brought you up
with great difficulty,

625
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,350
you too are going your
drunkard father's way...

626
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,552
I didn't drink.
Why are you lamenting?

627
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:37,426
What happened to you then?
- No... a girl...

628
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:38,731
A girl?

629
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,628
Had any dream?

630
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,431
Leave me alone, mother.

631
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:51,378
What are you looking at boy?

632
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,913
That's my vest brother.

633
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:55,809
It is!

634
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,650
So what?

635
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:00,656
Take it.

636
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:15,833
Hey, look after the shop,
I'll come back in a minute.

637
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:16,403
Okay, brother.

638
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:32,612
<i>I've started liking flower, thread,
earth, sky and garbage also...</i>

639
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,620
<i>... all because of her.</i>

640
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:39,557
<i>I've started liking river, moon, water...</i>

641
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,396
<i>Bloody, do your work!</i>

642
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,133
<i>I'll pluck out your eyes, be ware.</i>

643
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:49,969
<i>Her breath has
mesmerized me.</i>

644
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:54,634
<i>My breath is following her!</i>

645
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:59,145
<i>When I look at a scared girl,
fear takes me over.</i>

646
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:03,479
<i>I'm becoming restless.</i>

647
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:07,654
<i>He used to fall asleep,
as soon as he goes to bed.</i>

648
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:12,659
<i>Now he's sleepless all
the night like a mad!</i>

649
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:16,993
<i>He is not used to stand
in the hot sun.</i>

650
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:22,002
<i>But now he's seeing the hot sun.</i>

651
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:29,843
<i>I've started liking flower, thread,
earth, sky and garbage also...</i>

652
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,604
<i>... all because of her.</i>

653
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:31,939
Stop... stop...

654
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:36,680
Keep the change.

655
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:38,443
Hey, I'm calling you...

656
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:39,622
Bloody.

657
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,788
Same old board,
same old broken chair.

658
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:46,253
Same little brat!

659
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:49,695
Where's Murugan?

660
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,094
Brother has gone out.

661
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:52,097
Where has he gone?

662
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:53,196
I don't know.

663
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:56,970
Don't know? You do know,
but trying to hide.

664
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,105
Didn't I say I don't know.

665
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,469
What the hell you're saying?
Bloody face...

666
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,611
Why are you beating a little boy?

667
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:03,802
Is he a little boy?

668
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:04,480
Look at his face,

669
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,876
when he grows he'll commit
20 rapes, 10 murders,

670
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:08,884
he'll bite necks to kill babies.

671
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:09,882
He's a killer.

672
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:11,551
Don't beat me on my head.

673
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:12,687
As if you're great...

674
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,284
Go and order a tea for me.

675
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,051
There's no one to
look after the shop.

676
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,956
Do you need a man look
after this junk shop?

677
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:21,061
Great man of responsibility!

678
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:21,959
Go and get the tea.

679
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:23,361
Money?

680
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,226
Asking me?

681
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,627
I'm your guest,
go and get the tea.

682
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,463
Bloody, he's doing too much.

683
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,409
<i>I've started liking flower, thread,
earth, sky and garbage also...</i>

684
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,986
<i>... all because of her.</i>

685
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:51,751
<i>I've started liking hut, moon, water, fire...</i>

686
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,589
<i>... all because of her.</i>

687
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:04,540
Brother is my boss.

688
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:06,470
He can scold or abuse me.

689
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,440
He may even call me a brat!

690
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:11,743
Bloody! Who are you to
scold or abuse me?

691
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,181
Sucker! You'll come to have free tea.

692
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:15,779
Do I've to get it for you?

693
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,952
Lousy man, disgusting face,
and complexion.

694
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:27,858
Have you added plenty
of sugar to the tea?

695
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:29,526
Yes... plenty!

696
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,293
You're saying as
if you've added it.

697
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,272
Bloody, he never reforms
even after spitting.

698
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,139
Tea with vada.

699
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,145
Tea with cigarette.

700
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,113
Tea with... mango.

701
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:55,984
Tea with savouries.

702
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,353
Does your dirty face need a Pepsi?

703
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:24,611
Are you great Madhavan?

704
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:26,348
This is your Pepsi.

705
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,526
Brother, take Pepsi.

706
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:36,597
What man you've started
respecting me?

707
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,867
Nothing like that brother.

708
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:40,458
You're calling me brother also.

709
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,797
Nothing brother,
just giving respect to your age.

710
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,440
Why is the bottle full?

711
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,609
Brother, this is new Pepsi,
please have it.

712
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,375
Hey, come here.

713
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:53,305
What's it brother?

714
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:54,140
Did you ever drink a Pepsi?

715
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,181
I don't drink brother.

716
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,852
Please have little.
- No, please.

717
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:57,986
The bottle is full,
have little.

718
00:50:58,188 --> 00:50:59,655
You're the guest,
please you have it.

719
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,058
Drink... drink... drink...

720
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:16,526
What's this she's going
to a wine shop?

721
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:17,733
Oh My god!

722
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:23,229
Have Madurai girls
started drinking?

723
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:26,872
She's walking into the bar also.

724
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,472
She doesn't appear like that.

725
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,084
Is she his daughter?

726
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:41,149
Oh my god!

727
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,258
Let me escape.

728
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:20,821
Greetings brother... welcome sir.

729
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,521
Give a drink to her.

730
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,203
Did you bring me
here to drink this?

731
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,203
Thank god, I'm saved.

732
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,966
Is this ice cream?
- Yes sir.

733
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,209
How much business
you do everyday?

734
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,880
Somewhere over Rs. 300 sir...

735
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,443
Over Rs 300?
- Yes sir...

736
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:44,647
No... no need...
stay away from the girl.

737
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,147
For your job and status,

738
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:48,715
do you need that man's daughter?

739
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,383
Mind your work, mad boy.

740
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:55,629
Is it good to go after
her leaving the work?

741
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,624
Work is god.

742
00:53:59,202 --> 00:53:59,896
God!

743
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:03,900
In a split second everything
turned topsy turvy.

744
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,735
Never ever dream
about her also.

745
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,272
What are you looking at me?

746
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:09,410
Do your work boy?

747
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:10,846
What else am I doing then?

748
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:12,576
God!

749
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:19,383
Buddy! When did you come?

750
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,681
You'll ask now leisurely.

751
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:23,926
I didn't stay at home 10 minutes
also after coming from Madras.

752
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,057
I'm sitting here since
morning to meet you.

753
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:27,655
You're coming leisurely now.

754
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:28,795
Look, how many cigarettes
I've smoked?

755
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,327
Looks like a dust bin.

756
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:31,834
What's it? - Nothing.

757
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:33,002
What's it man?

758
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:36,436
Nothing.

759
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,834
You look little different.

760
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,073
You're not in the shop.

761
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:41,538
You're not leaving
any message behind.

762
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:44,543
Got hooked to any girl?

763
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:46,676
Come on, you too!

764
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:47,610
Buddy, I'm warning you.

765
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,178
If you get hooked up,
they will ditch you,

766
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:53,120
and walk out happily
leaving you in lurch.

767
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:54,790
We'll be left in lurch.
Mind it.

768
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,686
Nothing like that buddy.

769
00:54:57,327 --> 00:55:00,854
If you eat salt & drink water,
you'll get hiccups!

770
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,291
Buddy, listen to me.

771
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:05,630
Girls will roam with us
and do as we say.

772
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:08,297
But marry the man,
her family selects.

773
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,067
Our work will get bogged down.

774
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:15,235
So, I'm telling you,

775
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:16,742
work is more important
to us than anything.

776
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,473
Concentrate on coming up in life.

777
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:26,986
I'm talking to you
and you're silent.

778
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:28,583
Did you hear me?

779
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:32,788
Nothing buddy... nothing.

780
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:37,797
I'm talking and
he has vanished away.

781
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:39,993
Where is he going boy?

782
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:42,799
You know but you'll not tell me.

783
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:45,538
Why did you go to
the wine shop?

784
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:46,671
Am I not asking you?

785
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:48,738
Scared...

786
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:49,603
What?

787
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,670
Didn't you get scared
on seeing my father?

788
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:55,012
No... why should I get scared?

789
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:58,415
No, you really got scared,
I saw it on your face.

790
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,680
No... no... that wasn't scare...

791
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:04,458
If that wasn't, will you get
more scared also?

792
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:06,151
Teasing me?

793
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,129
I'm scared of anyone.

794
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:08,854
Is it so?

795
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:09,690
Yes.

796
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:10,456
Really?

797
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:11,533
Yes.

798
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:16,768
Then... can you kiss me bravely
on the road?

799
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:28,716
Hey... hey...

800
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:33,048
Hey stop... stop...

801
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:10,521
What's it?

802
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:13,922
Do you really like me?

803
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:16,698
I like you.

804
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,027
<i>Touching me...</i>

805
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:26,765
<i>Who turned this sand
into a statute?</i>

806
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,443
<i>Touching me...</i>

807
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:33,682
<i>Who planned and won
the butterfly's heart?</i>

808
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:41,119
<i>Falling into your eyes,
I've lost my way!</i>

809
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:48,730
<i>I'm losing myself in you and
becoming a part of your soul!</i>

810
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:57,964
<i>Touching me...</i>

811
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:03,574
<i>Who turned this sand
into a statute?</i>

812
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,407
<i>Touching me...</i>

813
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:11,311
<i>Who planned and won
the butterfly's heart?</i>

814
00:58:55,732 --> 00:59:02,695
<i>I forget whatever I speak with
my mother immediately.</i>

815
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:10,137
<i>Whatever I speak with you
remains in heart forever.</i>

816
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:24,783
<i>My mind will always search
the place of our first meet.</i>

817
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,728
<i>Even after the rain,</i>

818
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:32,232
<i>the branches of the tree will
shower little drops of rain.</i>

819
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:39,739
<i>Love has put a Himalayan
burden on my heart.</i>

820
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:47,174
<i>Love is a pet name to
tortures of the world.</i>

821
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:50,950
Ais, you'll not mind if
I ask a thing, will you?

822
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:51,711
Come out.

823
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,946
Do you really like me?

824
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,781
How many times will you
ask the same thing?

825
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:58,218
No... my friend said...

826
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:58,951
What did he say?

827
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:02,529
Girls in this age will
love passionately,

828
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:05,801
and then coolly marry the
groom selected by the family.

829
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,294
Are you doubting me?
- I didn't believe him.

830
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:11,434
But still I'm an ordinary mechanic...

831
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,136
You're from a rich family...

832
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:19,743
So... l'm scared if this will succeed.

833
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:21,544
Get lost mad boy!

834
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:25,152
<i>Wherever I may go...
Althrough my life...</i>

835
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:28,889
<i>I'll take rest in
your shade my dear...</i>

836
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:32,650
<i>If I face death...
I'll present a bouquet to it...</i>

837
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:36,525
<i>I'll die facing you...</i>

838
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:01,953
<i>Are the eyes wombs?</i>

839
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:05,624
<i>I was born again...</i>

840
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:13,128
<i>I'm carrying you in my heart
like a Kangaroo...</i>

841
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:24,042
<i>When anyone passes me
resembling you...</i>

842
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:27,946
<i>I always think about you...</i>

843
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:31,482
<i>To see your lovely face...</i>

844
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:35,220
<i>I desire to live...</i>

845
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:38,826
<i>Neither came closer
nor went away...</i>

846
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:42,720
<i>Love is a trouble of this heart...</i>

847
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:46,297
<i>Neither there's a start
nor end to it...</i>

848
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:50,400
<i>Love is like god...</i>

849
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:14,089
<i>Touching you...</i>

850
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:19,630
<i>Who turned sand like you
into a statute?</i>

851
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:21,428
<i>Touching you...</i>

852
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:26,673
<i>Who planned and won
your butterfly like heart?</i>

853
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:34,282
<i>Falling into your eyes,
I've lost my way!</i>

854
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:41,947
<i>I'm losing myself in you and
becoming a part of your soul!</i>

855
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:50,956
<i>Touching you...</i>

856
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:56,068
<i>Who turned sand like you
into a statute?</i>

857
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:58,306
<i>Touching you...</i>

858
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:02,304
<i>Who planned and won
your butterfly like heart?</i>

859
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:03,638
Is work going on Muruga?

860
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:04,312
Brother.

861
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:06,976
How many times
do I've to tell you?

862
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,314
Take your vehicle
and come tomorrow.

863
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:08,979
Brother, your vehicle
will be ready now.

864
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:10,812
Mileage is very low.

865
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:12,378
Shall I change the bike?

866
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:13,981
No need... l'll...

867
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:19,692
Flat tyre.

868
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,726
Hey boy, keep it there
and check that bike.

869
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:23,523
Okay brother.

870
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,528
Do it carefully.
- Okay brother.

871
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:37,905
Take it.

872
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:43,809
Boy, take the money.

873
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,317
Put it in the cash box.
- Okay brother.

874
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:07,267
What?

875
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:08,335
Where is Ais?

876
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:09,773
She's not here.

877
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:11,602
She didn't come to the school.

878
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:12,439
Where can I meet her?

879
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:13,945
If you want go to her house.

880
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:25,760
I don't want this mother.

881
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,689
Tell them I don't want
to marry now.

882
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:32,266
I want to study further,
please tell them aunty.

883
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:34,197
Please be patient.
- Why are you silent?

884
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,195
Sister is asking you man...
- Please aunty tell them,

885
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,299
I don't want this marriage.

886
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,941
Why are you sitting silent?

887
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:42,610
Hey, take the girl, let's go.

888
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:43,539
Be patient.

889
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:45,006
Why are you hesitating?

890
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:46,715
I don't have any objection.

891
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:48,975
My daughter wants
to study further...

892
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:50,117
That's why I'm hesitating little...

893
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,480
As if your daughter's studies
is going to fill my coffers.

894
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:55,188
Mother! You're sitting silently,
say something.

895
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,416
Enough of her studying,
accept this proposal.

896
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,117
Our wealth will last
for few generations.

897
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:01,228
Who is he?
My daughter's son!

898
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,794
He's her man, why delay,
why not now?

899
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:04,828
Why are you hesitating?

900
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:06,466
<i>He's having only one daughter.</i>

901
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:08,236
<i>I think his idea is
to educate her well.</i>

902
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:09,563
<i>Uncle, please stop it.</i>

903
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:11,240
<i>This education is more than
enough for girls of our clan.</i>

904
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:12,507
<i>What will she do after studying?</i>

905
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:14,902
<i>Are you watching her
from the childhood?</i>

906
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,611
<i>What was my age when
I married your father?</i>

907
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:18,739
<i>I was ten years old.</i>

908
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:22,008
<i>Didn't I give birth and brought
you up and acquire wealth?</i>

909
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:25,016
<i>She says she wants to study
and you're listening to her.</i>

910
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:27,189
<i>Never heed girls' words.</i>

911
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,254
<i>Do as you wish.</i>

912
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:31,591
Why are you disturbing
with horn here?

913
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:34,158
Repairing the horn...

914
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:35,261
Is it the place to do it?

915
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:36,325
Go that side.

916
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:38,934
What's the problem brother?
- Nothing...

917
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,440
How is your American groom?

918
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:46,602
What is he saying?

919
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:48,107
You like him, don't you?

920
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,470
Why are you going out
in school uniform?

921
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:51,772
Uncle!
- Yes dear.

922
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:53,340
No uncle...
- Go ahead.

923
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:56,073
I want to study further.

924
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,354
They are talking about
stopping my studies,

925
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:01,454
and getting me married.

926
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:05,722
You tell them,
they will listen to you.

927
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:07,296
Please uncle.

928
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,465
You want to study, isn't it?

929
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:14,135
Come.

930
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,633
So many are talking
but you're silent.

931
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:18,439
Studies or marriage which is
important to your daughter?

932
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,131
Mother, stop please.

933
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,703
No need to stop her studies now.

934
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:22,843
You want to stop the marriage?

935
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,034
No need to stop the marriage also.

936
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:25,411
Why are you confusing us?

937
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:28,082
Let the groom tie the knot
and go to America.

938
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:29,543
Meanwhile she'll
complete her studies.

939
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:32,646
When he comes next time,
let him take her to America.

940
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:33,981
What do you say?

941
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,818
If she wants to study further,
let her do it in America.

942
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:38,489
What do you say dear?

943
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:40,659
Exchange the proposals.

944
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:41,658
Are you happy now?

945
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:43,390
You go to the school.

946
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,110
Sathya, my family has
selected a groom for me.

947
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:00,810
I want to meet Murugan.

948
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,747
I can't live without meeting him.

949
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,681
What are you thinking Aishwarya?

950
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:06,787
Look, you are in no way
connected to him.

951
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:08,616
Think about your status
and his status.

952
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:10,121
I thought it was just
to pass the time.

953
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:11,623
You seem to be very serious.

954
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:19,831
Sorry, I couldn't take your
nasty comment on love.

955
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:22,327
Do you know how seriously
we love each other?

956
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:24,139
Sorry Sathya.

957
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,903
I can't stay in my house
another minute also.

958
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,777
They have selected a groom
and fixed my marriage.

959
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:35,375
Take me away to
some place, Muruga.

960
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:39,714
Otherwise they will
forcibly marry off me.

961
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,089
Please Muruga, take me
away to some place.

962
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:48,228
You marry me, only then
no one can separate us.

963
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:54,564
What are you thinking?

964
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:56,537
Why are you unmoved?

965
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,364
Do you really love me or not?

966
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,005
Tell me, do you really
love me or not?

967
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,144
Take me away from here.

968
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:05,776
Or else I'll die.

969
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:06,742
Ais, don't cry.

970
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,081
Bear it for a day.

971
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:10,184
Come.

972
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:19,888
Please don't tell this
to anyone, Sathya.

973
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:22,053
I swear I'll not tell.

974
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:27,358
You saved money with me
to open a shop of your own.

975
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,231
How can I manage if you
demand money immediately?

976
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,063
No sister...

977
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,864
Why do you need
money so urgently?

978
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:33,302
I need very urgently,

979
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:34,373
give me whatever
you can manage.

980
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:36,306
Okay, I'll get whatever I can.

981
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:39,180
Sister, try to get atleast Rs 2000.
- I'll try.

982
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:04,834
I'll take leave.

983
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:40,805
What is it Ais?

984
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:42,673
See that back side.

985
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:45,113
Look there.

986
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:53,847
Sorry sir...
unwittingly touched her...

987
01:09:54,056 --> 01:10:03,863
My leg is gone...
sorry sir... leave it sir...

988
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,100
Muruga... no...

989
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:07,425
I'll chop your leg.

990
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:08,326
Sorry sir...

991
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:28,056
Don't I know the police?

992
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:29,951
Don't I know to
lodge a complaint?

993
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:31,319
Is it the way to talk?

994
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:33,827
What the hell are
you running a school?

995
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:36,896
Calm down.
Why are you shouting at us?

996
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:38,099
Shouting at you?

997
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,894
Is it shouting to seek justice?

998
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:45,597
I came here respecting you,

999
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:47,435
your reply is like...

1000
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,507
Madam, we are illiterate rogues.

1001
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:56,280
We know only to
talk with weapons.

1002
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:58,509
Few consider us as good
and few as bad.

1003
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:00,621
Even our children don't know
what's our profession.

1004
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:01,721
We have grown to
become like this.

1005
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:05,189
We joined our children
here to learn English.

1006
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:07,862
My brother in a fit
of rage abused you,

1007
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:08,961
please don't mistake him.

1008
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:10,563
There's nothing wrong
in asking us,

1009
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:17,667
but his shouts makes
us feel guilty and hurt.

1010
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:19,898
Did you inquire her friends?

1011
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:21,237
No madam.

1012
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:23,639
First inquire them.

1013
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:24,972
I don't know uncle.

1014
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,408
I'll not be a human anymore
...tell me the truth or else...

1015
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,641
I don't know...
I didn't go to school today...

1016
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:30,819
She's very scared.

1017
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,215
She had fever and
didn't go to school.

1018
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:35,353
She is telling you, isn't she?
Why are you threatening her?

1019
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:40,721
Look, your daughter is seen
always with my daughter.

1020
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:43,523
Your daughter knows the
whereabouts of my daughter.

1021
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:46,394
If she tells the truth,
your family will stay alive.

1022
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:50,265
Or else I'll wipe out your family.

1023
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:52,900
She's just a little girl
and you are...

1024
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:57,044
What do you think of yourself?

1025
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:58,744
You are threatening my daughter.

1026
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:00,206
I'll call the police now.

1027
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:01,311
Hey call the police.

1028
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:02,211
What do they think of themselves?

1029
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:03,248
One minute...

1030
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:04,853
Please listen to me.
- What?

1031
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,385
What do you think of yourselves?

1032
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:08,647
Everyone is threatening us.

1033
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:10,154
Please listen to me patiently.

1034
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,951
You too have two daughters.

1035
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:15,355
How anxious you would be if one
doesn't come home till late night?

1036
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:17,054
He has only one daughter.

1037
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:19,698
In that anxiety, without drinking
even a drop of water,

1038
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,392
we are going all
around like mad men,

1039
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:24,666
In that anger my
brother was harsh.

1040
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:27,933
I seek your forgiveness
on his behalf.

1041
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:31,003
Shouldn't we ask you?

1042
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,741
Aishwarya is your friend, isn't she?

1043
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:34,747
You do come to our house, don't you?

1044
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:38,116
She's an innocent little girl,

1045
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,753
thinking about her
is giving me shivers.

1046
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:41,616
Don't know what to do.

1047
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:42,984
Please tell us if
you know anything.

1048
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,092
I beg you.

1049
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,163
We'll not harm you.

1050
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:50,865
Let's go.

1051
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:51,691
Uncle!

1052
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:55,061
What?

1053
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:04,074
Aishwarya... loves a mechanic
known as Murugan...

1054
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:08,007
...they are going to marry...

1055
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:13,945
...so they eloped
