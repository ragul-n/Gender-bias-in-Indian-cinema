1
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:53,935
How did it happen?

2
00:02:57,974 --> 00:03:00,365
When the life we have spent is so good...

3
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:04,262
Our death will also be so.

4
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:07,686
He proved this point with his death today.

5
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,472
Such a huge crowd!

6
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:16,629
He had built a wedding hall on his wife's
name, Sri Rajyalakshmi Wedding hall.

7
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:21,080
Smallest families to the biggest.
Poorest families to the richest.

8
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,481
He did planned great
weddings in that hall.

9
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:30,127
Until today, if someone has
to think of a wedding...

10
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,115
They only think about SR Wedding hall.

11
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:37,838
But his son Dharma is not so good.

12
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:41,735
Don't know what will happen
to that wedding hall now!

13
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:50,768
S.R. WEDDING HALL

14
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:03,831
Ticket! Take your tickets...

15
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:07,539
Ticket!

16
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,706
Pedda Kodavanllapalla... Hold on!

17
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:19,997
Get on...

18
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:27,122
What, grandpa...
Are you going to Dharma's house?

19
00:04:27,164 --> 00:04:30,664
-Yeah.
-Ok, careful. There are stones all over.

20
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:33,331
The bill froze and the road
got left under construction.

21
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,373
Ok, son.

22
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:52,914
God!

23
00:04:55,414 --> 00:04:57,122
Early in the morning!

24
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:08,997
-Hello!
-Hello, this is Sreedhar, sir.

25
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:12,664
I'm calling from Idea.
What network are you using, sir?

26
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:15,997
Of course, Jio.

27
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:18,790
Only Jio works here.

28
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,914
How can you say that, sir?
We put up two towers recently.

29
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:24,247
Change to our network, sir.
You'll have a lot of offers.

30
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:26,790
-I don't want any offer.
-Sir, please listen to me, sir...

31
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:30,539
-Don't call me and that's the offer.
-Sir, you'll have a great signal, sir.

32
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,872
You can watch videos too, sir.
Please listen to me, sir.

33
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,539
-Didn't you hear?
-As if you said something!

34
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:43,498
20 years of marriage and
she has no idea what I want.

35
00:05:43,664 --> 00:05:45,164
She needs me to put it in words!

36
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:50,164
-Prepare some decoction.
-I said yes to everything and made you lazy!

37
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:53,206
What's with your mess
early in the morning!

38
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:56,664
I don't understand...
Shut up and do as I say.

39
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:02,872
What is he doing here?

40
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,247
God, do I have to deal with him now?

41
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:10,247
Dharma, last week...

42
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:13,498
...I have paid you in advance for my
daughter's marriage in your wedding hall.

43
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:17,456
You're from Ramapuram, right?
I remember. Sit sit.

44
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:18,623
The wedding will be grand.

45
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,414
No no, I'm not here to sit
or talk about the wedding.

46
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:24,539
My son-in-law said he don't want to
get married in your wedding hall.

47
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:29,289
With all the alcohol bottles lying
around, who will get married there?

48
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:32,081
-What are you saying?
-Give me my advance back.

49
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:34,289
Are you kidding me? Huh!

50
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:41,289
We are not running a free wedding
hall to keep giving back advances.

51
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:46,289
I don't know all that. I'm not leaving
until you give me my advance back.

52
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,539
-No way! You can leave.
-Do you want some water?

53
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:52,581
I don't need water.
I need my advance back.

54
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:54,581
I'll send the money to your house.
You go now.

55
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:57,039
Here.

56
00:07:03,414 --> 00:07:06,914
I'm dealing with him, right?
Why do you interfere?

57
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:13,122
They just make half fool out of
me and you complete the rest.

58
00:07:13,122 --> 00:07:14,955
-You too made fools out of us.
-You drink.

59
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:17,706
This is the tenth
wedding that went back.

60
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:20,498
You dragged our family onto the road.

61
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:23,748
What are you even doing
in the wedding hall?

62
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,331
-Drinking all the time!
-As if I have no idea...

63
00:07:26,955 --> 00:07:29,706
...what to do and what not to.
You come to manage it then.

64
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:34,081
I don't even have the money for maintenance
and you keep yelling on top of it.

65
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:37,289
Yeah, I know what you
need the maintenance for.

66
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:41,081
All the money goes for your
fake fans and their drinks.

67
00:07:41,122 --> 00:07:43,706
-What else is remaining with us?
-What the hell!

68
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:46,081
Won't you let me live in this house?

69
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:48,581
Talk again and I'll slap you
with a slipper across your face.

70
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:51,331
You don't even have money to
buy any slippers. Get lost!

71
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:53,206
-Hell with him!
-Damn it!

72
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:55,456
I can find no peace in this house.

73
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:02,164
You are angry with me.
Not on that pole.

74
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:04,122
See how you have bent it.

75
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:06,373
Haven't you gone inside yet?

76
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:09,831
-I won't. You get out.
-Damn my bloody life.

77
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:12,955
I can't even stay for one
more minute in this house.

78
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,414
Nothing, Dharma...

79
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:23,247
We are talking about who had the
highest harvest of sugarcane this year.

80
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:26,623
I had a huge harvest in my house.
Go eat!

81
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:30,414
They want all the gossips
in the world. Move!

82
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:32,706
[remix song playing on stereo]

83
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:51,790
He's always strong.
You are the one who bring him down.

84
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:54,997
-You will spoil his life one day.
-Brother...

85
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:58,664
It's not your girlfriend's hips
they touched. It's his girlfriend's.

86
00:08:58,664 --> 00:08:59,790
He feels the pain.

87
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:03,206
Why do you care? Do we need all
this just for a girl's hips?

88
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:07,748
Look at them drink like pigs!

89
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:14,498
Glory to God!
Jesus will take care of everything.

90
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:36,456
Hey, who the hell is he?

91
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:41,122
Brother!

92
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:45,039
Don't you have girlfriends?

93
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:47,498
Or don't they have any hips?

94
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,706
God! Every Tom Dick and Harry talk
about my girlfriend's hips these days!

95
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:57,997
We are having liquor in peace here...

96
00:10:58,206 --> 00:10:59,790
What's with this hips mess now?

97
00:11:07,122 --> 00:11:10,331
Brother, you know how much I like Sindhu.

98
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:14,289
Why do you keep poking
me all the time?

99
00:11:14,831 --> 00:11:17,872
God, what did I even do?

100
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:20,914
She asked me to be her
dance partner and I went.

101
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:25,206
The song is too romantic!

102
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:27,498
Too much!

103
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:30,039
And her hips came into
my hands accidentally.

104
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,831
I just gave it a nice squeeze.

105
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:37,955
What's there in it?

106
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,456
Brother... This is not right.

107
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:45,790
Did I ever disturb your girls?

108
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,414
What's your problem?

109
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,206
How can someone let
a girl like her go?

110
00:11:52,664 --> 00:11:55,997
Her hips... Her beauty... God!

111
00:11:56,955 --> 00:12:00,373
If it was me...
Things would have gone differently.

112
00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:03,748
My friend is still a good boy.
What say, dude?

113
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:07,498
Drink...

114
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:15,331
-Oh Jesus!
-He did it!

115
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:23,247
Guys, you drank my beers for free.
Go hit him.

116
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:43,456
Let's go help him!

117
00:12:43,498 --> 00:12:46,289
He'll help himself... You stay back.

118
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:09,997
Why?

119
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,914
What's with him? Get lost!

120
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:25,539
What?

121
00:13:31,081 --> 00:13:33,289
I have never seen you in college.

122
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:35,790
You are the one who pays condonation.
Not me.

123
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:36,831
Get lost!

124
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:42,997
All this is just because
of the hips! God!

125
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:48,872
-Girlfriend on phone.
-I can understand. Go.

126
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:52,039
-Get lost!
-Yeah, baby... My work is done here.

127
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:25,664
If you ever trying to poke her again...

128
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,247
I'll slap you with a
slipper across your face.

129
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:39,289
Kalyan, you'll die.
Enemies might come into your building.

130
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:49,331
-Get out of that building.
-Brother, come what may...

131
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:57,831
It's ok. I'll revive if it comes to that.

132
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:00,831
Of course! God, I'm down.

133
00:15:01,206 --> 00:15:03,122
-Daniel, revive me.
-No!

134
00:15:03,664 --> 00:15:05,081
The blue zone is coming.

135
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:10,872
Kalyan there they are.
Backside... Yeah, kill them.

136
00:15:11,206 --> 00:15:12,414
They killed me.

137
00:15:12,414 --> 00:15:14,039
Rest in peace, bro.

138
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:24,289
Hey, Kalyan!

139
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:27,706
Why did she came instead of madam?

140
00:15:27,706 --> 00:15:30,206
Now I have to bear with
their weird romance! Damn it.

141
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:35,914
You... Come out.

142
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:55,247
She's scolding you and
you have no shame at all!

143
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:56,289
That's my Sindhu, dude.

144
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,373
Backbench students like you
bring shame to students like us.

145
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:00,914
Hey, just study!

146
00:16:00,914 --> 00:16:04,206
Go go... She will never pass
M1 and will never fall for you.

147
00:16:11,914 --> 00:16:15,331
-You have to talk to your parents.
-Give me some time.

148
00:16:15,623 --> 00:16:19,456
He is mourning mom's death.
I'll talk to him.

149
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:28,373
What's with you? Huh?

150
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,122
I will never fall for you.
You are just a dog in my eyes.

151
00:16:32,164 --> 00:16:34,623
Of course, Sindhu... Treat me like a dog.

152
00:16:34,623 --> 00:16:36,831
Take me into your lap.
Play with my hair.

153
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:39,331
Kiss me now and then.

154
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,373
-Treat me like a dog.
-Damn you!

155
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:46,289
Why can't you talk like a guy
with feelings and self-respect.

156
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:49,206
I do have them, Sindhu.
That's why I'm following you everywhere.

157
00:16:49,706 --> 00:16:51,706
Do you know what you made me into?

158
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:56,790
I don't know even if the
author understands it.

159
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,831
How will one pass this subject?

160
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,914
Who's that?

161
00:17:07,498 --> 00:17:10,914
Sir, my name is Kalyan, sir.
I'm a fresher.

162
00:17:12,914 --> 00:17:14,539
I'm not in a mood to rag you.

163
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:17,914
Come to Lakshmi Vilas mess,
fresh in the morning. Let's plan there.

164
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:24,664
What's that?

165
00:17:24,997 --> 00:17:27,664
-Costly liquor, sir.
-One can study later.

166
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,289
Come sit. Let's have a drink.

167
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:34,831
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

168
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:40,831
Tell me... What's your problem?

169
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:47,623
Sir, I'm in deep love with
Sindhu from the last ten days.

170
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,539
What should I do?

171
00:17:50,748 --> 00:17:53,373
I came to know that you have
your eye on the same girl.

172
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,831
Loan shark Paparoa's daughter Sindhu?

173
00:17:57,373 --> 00:17:58,790
I do...

174
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:06,664
What?

175
00:18:13,164 --> 00:18:14,539
What happened?

176
00:18:14,706 --> 00:18:16,997
For your character and intelligence...

177
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:20,247
I'm scared that she
will fall for you, sir.

178
00:18:20,955 --> 00:18:23,748
-I can't sleep at night.
-What should we do then?

179
00:18:23,955 --> 00:18:25,081
Cheers!

180
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:32,664
Ok...

181
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:36,498
Let's say she falls for my
character and intelligence.

182
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,039
She's in first year and
I'm in the final year.

183
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,081
Yes, sir.

184
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:43,914
So I have to trust her with somebody
for three years after college.

185
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:47,664
Let's do something. You take her.

186
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:51,122
I'll go with someone else. Ok?

187
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:52,706
Thanks, sir!

188
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:56,581
You'll either go for the
feet, or the neck!

189
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:09,664
Maybe the last warning
wasn't enough, dude.

190
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:13,539
He says that Sindhu is his sister-in-law,
and is talking vulgarly about her.

191
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:16,831
This warning should make
him tremble with fear.

192
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:29,414
Hey, mad-max!

193
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:36,748
Give me one quality that can make
Sindhu call you 'Babe'?

194
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:39,456
-She's my sister's daughter.
-Is it?

195
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:41,081
Isn't that enough?

196
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:44,748
Not like that...

197
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:49,164
One quality in you that will make
a beautiful girl call you 'Babe'.

198
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:51,581
I'm fair. My height.

199
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:54,373
I'm richer than anyone in this college.

200
00:19:54,581 --> 00:19:57,623
-What more qualities do you need?
-Is it?

201
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:02,581
-Come. This is Sindu. Your sister-in-law.
-Me? Oh... Hi!

202
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:04,581
I'm ragging her. Go save her.

203
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,623
-Save her.
-Here comes your babe.

204
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:11,414
[commotion]

205
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:14,914
How dare you not to
accept Kalyan's proposal!

206
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,581
-Babe, save me.
-Go save her!

207
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:19,748
Oh, your babe is not man enough!

208
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:22,039
-Save her.
-Go on!

209
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:26,164
-Save me, babe.
-Go on... Save her.

210
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:27,539
Save me!

211
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:30,539
For a beautiful girl to call you 'Babe'...

212
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:33,790
You don't need to be
fair, have height, or money.

213
00:20:34,373 --> 00:20:35,748
You need to be man enough.

214
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:40,831
I don't like Sindhu calling you 'Babe'.

215
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:43,456
Make her call you 'Brother'. Ok?

216
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:46,831
If you are her brother,
I hope you know what I'll be to her.

217
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,247
-Babe!
-Good good good!

218
00:20:53,581 --> 00:20:58,164
You scared guys away from me
from the last three years.

219
00:20:59,706 --> 00:21:02,289
We have to get married to a single
guy and stick with him then.

220
00:21:02,914 --> 00:21:07,081
For being this beautiful,
at least let me have followers now.

221
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:09,997
You even hit my dance partner.

222
00:21:09,997 --> 00:21:11,831
-I'm here to dance with you, right?
-Damn you!

223
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:15,289
-With you?
-Please, Sindhu. I'll dance!

224
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:17,039
Please, Sindhu. Sindhu!

225
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:20,539
Why are you leaving? Please, girl...
Girl, I'll dance with you.

226
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:23,122
Girl? As if I'm your wife or something.

227
00:21:23,122 --> 00:21:24,955
I got fixed that you are my wife.

228
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:26,498
Stop acting extra smart.

229
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:28,664
Sindhu!

230
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:33,997
Please, Sindhu... I'll dance with you!

231
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:36,414
Sindhu...

232
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:37,955
Ok... Stop it now!

233
00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:41,373
Ready?

234
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,414
-What is she even doing?
-No idea.

235
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,081
Look at those hips swing.

236
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:10,164
Nothing is swinging there.

237
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:15,289
No matter how you look,
nothing is swinging, bro.

238
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,831
-Let's leave.
-Hey, stay put.

239
00:22:17,872 --> 00:22:19,748
I worked hard for this opportunity.

240
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:28,122
Thank God!

241
00:22:28,164 --> 00:22:29,955
-Kalyan, come up.
-Me?

242
00:22:31,581 --> 00:22:33,164
-Great chance.
-Go, dude!

243
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,456
Tell me, Sindhu.

244
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:39,539
-Don't get over-excited. Do as I say.
-Ok.

245
00:22:41,623 --> 00:22:45,289
-Go 1 2 3 4 with the first line.
-1 2 3 4...

246
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:46,955
4 too? Ok 4.

247
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:49,331
Go down...

248
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:51,831
Go down...

249
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:53,581
-At the hip...
-At the hip!

250
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:57,955
-For the next line, 5 6 7 8.
-5 6 7 8.

251
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,831
The second step feels so great, Sindhu.

252
00:23:01,206 --> 00:23:03,373
-Play the song.
-Play it, fast.

253
00:23:03,498 --> 00:23:04,748
Of course.

254
00:23:05,914 --> 00:23:06,914
Hey!

255
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:21,623
Ask him to stop.
His face might go into her hips.

256
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:23,748
-[humming]
-Stop!

257
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,997
What are you doing?

258
00:23:26,997 --> 00:23:28,790
Did the head movement got too
much, Sindhu?

259
00:23:29,997 --> 00:23:32,081
I'll do it perfectly this time. Play!

260
00:23:32,122 --> 00:23:34,122
Don't overact. Do as I say.

261
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:35,581
Ok.

262
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:40,664
God damn!

263
00:23:41,414 --> 00:23:42,539
Hey...

264
00:23:49,164 --> 00:23:52,081
Wow! Look at him hit it.

265
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:56,790
-Look at him enjoy.
-Let's go.

266
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:21,498
Let's go.

267
00:24:22,664 --> 00:24:23,872
Anything else, brother?

268
00:24:23,914 --> 00:24:26,664
-Two finger chips. One breezer.
-Ok, brother.

269
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:31,498
This is too much, brother.

270
00:24:31,498 --> 00:24:34,831
-Sorry, brother. Didn't see you there.
-God!

271
00:24:35,914 --> 00:24:40,664
I told you that she's not your type.
Why don't you listen to me?

272
00:24:40,955 --> 00:24:44,164
How can a senior know
the juniors' problems!

273
00:24:44,164 --> 00:24:47,373
What problems? He's following her
shamelessly for the last three years.

274
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,748
Waste of time. Waste of money

275
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:52,539
Brother...

276
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,498
These days, you have to pay 10
- 25 rupees to see flowers in the park.

277
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:02,122
Imagine how much we have to pay to see
the beauty the God created with interest.

278
00:25:02,914 --> 00:25:05,164
It's bad if we scold girls.

279
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:09,456
If the girl scolds you, consider that a
dessert for that night. Why feel shame?

280
00:25:09,498 --> 00:25:12,790
-Stop with all that.
-It's easy to be said than be done.

281
00:27:39,664 --> 00:27:41,122
You are just a kid.

282
00:27:41,164 --> 00:27:43,831
Imagine how many guys would have
proposed to me in my 6th grade!

283
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:45,790
How many in 7th grade!

284
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,039
And how many in 8th!

285
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:50,206
And then the Inter!

286
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:54,373
Me, who didn't fall for any of them...
How do you think I'll fall for you? Huh!

287
00:27:55,872 --> 00:27:57,373
Go.

288
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:08,122
-Tell me, mom.
-Your dad hasn't been home for two days.

289
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,456
-Where are you?
-Heading towards my room, mom.

290
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,623
Call your dad and
ask him to come home.

291
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:15,331
What, bro? Call from home?

292
00:29:16,872 --> 00:29:17,872
Oh, Jesus!

293
00:29:17,914 --> 00:29:20,914
No matter how happy you are, why did
a call from your home make you so sad?

294
00:29:21,955 --> 00:29:23,790
What now?
Do you want me to call your dad?

295
00:29:23,955 --> 00:29:25,414
I don't understand...

296
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:30,872
Just like we can't say how and when
the water enters into the coconut...

297
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:36,331
We can't say when life will be at it's
highest and when it will be at its lowest.

298
00:29:39,414 --> 00:29:40,581
God!

299
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,790
Listen...

300
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:46,664
I am vexed with this song.

301
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,997
I gave the phone to someone
and he set it as the ringtone.

302
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,247
Change it right away.

303
00:29:52,498 --> 00:29:55,331
As if I know how to do it.

304
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:56,664
Nice!

305
00:29:56,914 --> 00:29:59,955
We both are the same... Tata and Birla.

306
00:30:04,748 --> 00:30:08,539
-Hello!
-[breaking]: Uncle, this is Barath speaking.

307
00:30:08,664 --> 00:30:10,414
-Tell me.
-Nothing, uncle.

308
00:30:10,748 --> 00:30:14,623
Aunty called me,
as she couldn't reach Kalyan.

309
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,498
She's so scared that you
haven't been home for two days.

310
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:22,206
In fact, she's crying too.

311
00:30:22,581 --> 00:30:23,748
Hey...

312
00:30:24,664 --> 00:30:29,955
I gave birth to a bloody son,
to whom you have become a friend...

313
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:34,498
His mom asked him to call me and
he didn't want to talk to me.

314
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:39,623
Do you think I don't know that he
asked you to call me, you silly Barath!

315
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:43,539
-Uncle, that's...
-I'm drunk right now...

316
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:48,206
If I come there, I'll slap you with
a slipper across your face. Get lost!

317
00:30:49,997 --> 00:30:52,790
Hey... It's the Sivagami!

318
00:30:53,872 --> 00:30:55,872
It seems like she's crying for me.

319
00:31:00,122 --> 00:31:01,289
What?

320
00:31:03,122 --> 00:31:06,414
Why won't he ever talk about his dad?

321
00:31:06,706 --> 00:31:08,539
-What?
-I don't know!

322
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:12,706
No one knows why his engine fails,
listening to his father's name.

323
00:31:17,122 --> 00:31:18,498
My son...

324
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:23,831
He used to be behind me all day...

325
00:31:27,706 --> 00:31:34,498
He was not able to sleep anywhere
else, except by my side.

326
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:42,039
What dress he looks good in...
How to style his hair...

327
00:31:43,122 --> 00:31:44,581
I know everything so well.

328
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:47,414
With the side ways hair...

329
00:31:49,623 --> 00:31:51,247
He used to look like a hero!

330
00:31:52,997 --> 00:31:54,623
Listen to this...

331
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:59,039
I used to feed him his favorite <i>rasam</i>...

332
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:04,081
It used to drip of his little mouth and
I used to feed it back to him.

333
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:07,039
He used to love it!

334
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,373
I don't what happened.

335
00:32:18,997 --> 00:32:21,955
He stopped talking to me...

336
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,664
I have no idea why!

337
00:32:32,456 --> 00:32:33,706
No!

338
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:38,247
No one should have a son like him!

339
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:45,664
This headache is killing me.

340
00:32:46,623 --> 00:32:50,289
Hand me a peg...
No no, hand me the bottle.

341
00:33:02,515 --> 00:33:05,265
You said your parents will
agree if I have a job, right?

342
00:33:05,765 --> 00:33:08,515
-What's this now?
-I thought my dad will agree.

343
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,140
But you have no idea what's
happening at my home.

344
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:13,390
I'm helpless now.

345
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:16,057
-You have to do something.
-What can I do? Also...

346
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:17,432
-Tarun?
-Sir.

347
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,682
-What's the problem?
-Nothing, sir.

348
00:33:19,849 --> 00:33:21,390
-Meet me in my office.
-Ok, sir.

349
00:33:25,974 --> 00:33:28,140
Here comes your girl. Go!

350
00:33:28,348 --> 00:33:30,557
-She's never this early!
-Today she is...

351
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:38,557
Sindhu... Stop!

352
00:33:39,473 --> 00:33:43,765
-Sindhu, please. Stop! Sindhu...
-Hey!

353
00:33:44,265 --> 00:33:46,557
Where are you going to?
Where's your ID card?

354
00:33:46,682 --> 00:33:48,348
ID! Brother, just two minutes.

355
00:33:48,557 --> 00:33:51,348
-No ID. No entry.
-Just two minutes.

356
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,932
The Principal already
scolded me because of you.

357
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:58,057
Not to the class, just to flirt with her.
I can't find her these days.

358
00:33:58,098 --> 00:34:01,223
You can never woo her.
Go get your ID card.

359
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:04,140
-You say I can't win her?
-Who said you so?

360
00:34:04,181 --> 00:34:06,807
They are made for eachother.
Cute couple!

361
00:34:07,265 --> 00:34:10,974
-How will you attend the class?
-Class? I have a canteen to attend.

362
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:13,390
-Let's go eat something.
-You have to pay the bill.

363
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:32,265
Look at it swing like a
vehicle on a ghat road.

364
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,057
Hi, Sindhu.

365
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:37,765
What? What are you doing,
ragging me early in the morning?

366
00:34:38,265 --> 00:34:40,181
Just to watch your hips swing.

367
00:35:15,557 --> 00:35:18,890
Damn! Is the hostel food so tasty?
Your hips size is growing!

368
00:35:18,932 --> 00:35:20,307
What do you know about my hips?

369
00:35:20,348 --> 00:35:23,057
I know it better than you.
That's the reason I love you.

370
00:35:23,098 --> 00:35:24,557
What do you even know about it?

371
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,682
What do I even know!

372
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:32,181
I saw it for the first time on July 12th
2016, 05:45 PM, on the college steps.

373
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:33,557
Back then it's size is 24.

374
00:35:33,557 --> 00:35:35,974
Back from 2-1 holidays, it grew to 26.

375
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:40,765
You are trying to reduce it,
but all that reduce are your marks now.

376
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:43,181
You use only three brands.
Lee, Levis, Wrangler.

377
00:35:43,223 --> 00:35:45,807
You wore saree to college for 8 times.

378
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:48,849
And you tie it 3cm below your navel.

379
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:51,724
When you sit, it will take two folds
on the right and one on the left.

380
00:35:51,765 --> 00:35:54,473
There is a mole right
next to your navel.

381
00:35:54,515 --> 00:35:57,849
Only I know that it's fake.

382
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,724
I never looked at the black
board, but only at your hips.

383
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:03,724
Even now I wanted to
touch your hips so badly.

384
00:36:19,057 --> 00:36:20,682
Madam!

385
00:36:28,515 --> 00:36:30,307
Enough of gawking. Study!

386
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:37,390
Is your phone on silent?
Call your mom urgently.

387
00:36:47,057 --> 00:36:49,557
-Tell me, mom.
-Come home at once.

388
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:52,724
-What happened, mom.
-Do as I say. Come home.

389
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:31,599
I know you'll see a day like
this with all your habits.

390
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:34,348
-Hell with your life!
-Why are you shouting at me?

391
00:37:35,057 --> 00:37:36,432
Let it go!

392
00:37:37,016 --> 00:37:39,932
Should I go beg the ones
who looted my properties?

393
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:43,682
They are not useless people
like you to give it back.

394
00:37:43,682 --> 00:37:45,057
Yes!

395
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:47,307
I'm a useless fellow.

396
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,682
I know nothing but to eat and sleep.

397
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,181
I'm not asking for your money, right?
I know what to do.

398
00:37:54,974 --> 00:37:56,307
No advice needed.

399
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,057
-Get lost you!
-Hey...

400
00:37:59,181 --> 00:38:03,348
Yeah, walk away.
No one can bring good to you guys.

401
00:38:11,932 --> 00:38:15,515
He blew a lot on his drinking...

402
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,932
And now he's planning to
drag your name through the mud!

403
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:24,016
-What happened?
-Nothing!

404
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:28,890
He stooped to a level where he
put the wedding hall on loan.

405
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,223
-Loan?
-You foolish woman!

406
00:38:31,682 --> 00:38:36,682
He took 25 lakhs from a Loan shark
Paparao, putting the wedding hall papers.

407
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:41,265
He can't be at peace
until he blows that away.

408
00:38:41,724 --> 00:38:43,016
What are you saying?

409
00:38:43,515 --> 00:38:45,974
He will never listen to me,
no matter how much I shout.

410
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,016
This house still has some respect
remaining because of that hall.

411
00:38:51,765 --> 00:38:55,599
Ask him not to drag my dad's name
through mud, losing that too.

412
00:38:57,265 --> 00:39:01,307
Your grandpa asked me only
one thing in his whole life.

413
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,724
To save that wedding hall.

414
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:10,557
He went through hell until his last day.

415
00:39:12,765 --> 00:39:15,348
He knew that this day would come.

416
00:39:15,473 --> 00:39:18,974
That's why he put the
wedding hall in my name.

417
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:24,682
Your dad always thinks
that I shout at him.

418
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:26,682
He will never understand my pain.

419
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,890
To tell you about all this...
You act like you don't care.

420
00:39:33,223 --> 00:39:35,265
I told him close to 20 times by now...

421
00:39:36,348 --> 00:39:39,432
You keep saying that
you'll fly to America.

422
00:39:41,223 --> 00:39:43,932
I'm telling you today...

423
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:48,223
Do you know how great Sri
Rajyalakshmi wedding hall used to be?

424
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:51,599
Listen to me.

425
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:55,682
Save the hall,
at least for your grandpa.

426
00:40:00,473 --> 00:40:02,265
Why is he here?

427
00:40:02,932 --> 00:40:07,265
With both mom and son together,
the dose will be increased today.

428
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,890
Here comes your dad!

429
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,390
As if he beheaded 100 soldiers in war.

430
00:40:16,724 --> 00:40:18,140
Bloody!

431
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,473
-Beheading one head will keep me at peace.
-My head?

432
00:40:21,682 --> 00:40:24,724
Not your Katappa... Sivagami's head!

433
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,765
Why don't you answer my call?

434
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:36,016
Don't you care about
the women back home?

435
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:40,765
-Where are you drinking at?
-She will never let me be at peace.

436
00:40:40,765 --> 00:40:43,599
Keeps nagging all the time!

437
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:48,515
The house will be safe only
when the men are dutiful.

438
00:40:49,057 --> 00:40:53,557
Spending all the money will
throw us onto the roads.

439
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:58,016
Don't know why they
named her Shanti (peace).

440
00:40:58,265 --> 00:41:00,473
That's the one thing
that's missing with her.

441
00:41:01,098 --> 00:41:04,265
Look at him...
Didn't eat properly for two days!

442
00:41:06,057 --> 00:41:08,057
Look at your dad...

443
00:41:08,348 --> 00:41:11,932
Getting ready as if
he's leaving for school.

444
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:16,765
What should I do then?
Shall I dance for you?

445
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,890
Shameless!

446
00:41:21,473 --> 00:41:26,181
You have no value here.
No one sees you as a father or a husband.

447
00:41:26,473 --> 00:41:29,265
You can't stay in this
house for one more second.

448
00:41:30,223 --> 00:41:31,348
Damn it!

449
00:41:33,974 --> 00:41:37,890
See? He forgot to hit his head. Hit it!

450
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,348
-Happy?
-Yeah happy!

451
00:41:42,557 --> 00:41:44,765
Look at his monkey face!

452
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,557
Move.

453
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:09,348
I did a huge mistake,
talking a loan on my only land.

454
00:42:09,473 --> 00:42:11,640
It's not right to cheat me like this.

455
00:42:12,473 --> 00:42:14,974
You gave me a loan of 15 lakhs
for my daughter's education.

456
00:42:15,057 --> 00:42:18,640
-Now it's 1.5 crores.
-What's in the value!

457
00:42:19,682 --> 00:42:23,974
Today is the last date
for your final payment.

458
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,473
Give me my money and take your land.

459
00:42:27,473 --> 00:42:29,473
I failed to collect the amount.

460
00:42:29,557 --> 00:42:32,181
Not even the ones who
owe me are paying.

461
00:42:32,223 --> 00:42:34,307
He's the one who told them not to.

462
00:42:34,348 --> 00:42:39,016
Keep that land and at least give me
the money for my daughter's marriage.

463
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,849
I paid for her education.

464
00:42:42,473 --> 00:42:44,890
Now you ask me to pay for her marriage.

465
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,140
Why did you even give birth to her?

466
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,765
Don't say that. I beg you.

467
00:42:51,932 --> 00:42:53,932
I have nothing else but this land.

468
00:42:53,932 --> 00:42:56,016
He won't listen to you.

469
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,849
Take him away when you can.

470
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:02,599
You can't cheat an old man like
me, Paparao.

471
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:08,432
If you don't have the money,
get her married in a community hall.

472
00:43:08,432 --> 00:43:14,223
If both rich and poor want the same
life, what's the point in it?

473
00:43:16,265 --> 00:43:18,599
Don't know who will
teach them a lesson.

474
00:43:34,515 --> 00:43:37,599
Grandpa, you are planning your
daughter's marriage, is it?

475
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,473
He made a deal with the Loan shark.
That marriage is not happening.

476
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:57,515
-Who are you?
-Heir to the SR Wedding hall, sir.

477
00:43:59,473 --> 00:44:01,807
Oh, you're Dharma's son!

478
00:44:05,265 --> 00:44:07,432
They say that you don't
talk to your dad, right?

479
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,432
These kids have no idea
of growing in life.

480
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:13,557
I want to talk to you.

481
00:44:15,348 --> 00:44:17,515
Why will he talk to a kid?

482
00:44:17,557 --> 00:44:20,432
As if I'm still attending school!

483
00:44:24,181 --> 00:44:28,640
Didn't your father teach you
how to talk to the elders?

484
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:30,932
How to talk to the elderly fools.

485
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,515
Your cheating came to my wedding hall.
I want to talk to you about that.

486
00:44:37,515 --> 00:44:41,765
What's there to talk to me?
Go talk with your dad.

487
00:44:42,348 --> 00:44:45,640
He's the one who took
loan on the wedding hall.

488
00:44:45,765 --> 00:44:47,849
Who the hell are you guys to do that?

489
00:44:48,473 --> 00:44:50,307
That hall is under my mom's name.

490
00:44:52,473 --> 00:44:54,307
Oh, God!

491
00:44:55,223 --> 00:44:57,390
Such a cheat!

492
00:44:58,098 --> 00:45:02,223
I paid him without reading the papers!

493
00:45:02,223 --> 00:45:05,140
Simple, sir.
Just like we make his dad drink...

494
00:45:05,181 --> 00:45:07,307
Let's make his mom drink too.

495
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:30,307
Making mom drink!
Don't you have any sense?

496
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,765
My dad might not ask you
about why you cheated him.

497
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:52,599
But I'm not like my dad.

498
00:46:00,265 --> 00:46:03,640
24/7 you keep talking about
youth not planning to grow.

499
00:46:03,682 --> 00:46:06,348
Won't you want to grow?
Very disappointed, uncle.

500
00:46:06,724 --> 00:46:08,640
Don't poke us. We will grow in life.

501
00:46:14,557 --> 00:46:17,724
Uncle, you might find this sarcastic...

502
00:46:17,932 --> 00:46:20,057
We are really close to each other, uncle.

503
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:37,890
Kill him!

504
00:46:42,265 --> 00:46:45,515
You know Paparao is Sindhu's father
and you still messed with him.

505
00:46:45,765 --> 00:46:50,557
Bro, I don't know what pain inside you
is making you take these decisions.

506
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,765
What will your father say to this?

507
00:47:05,307 --> 00:47:07,682
They got used to tasteless food outside.

508
00:47:08,057 --> 00:47:11,181
Look at them eat!

509
00:47:12,557 --> 00:47:15,557
Don't blame them for eating.
Do you wanna eat?

510
00:47:15,724 --> 00:47:18,807
I don't want to.
Mom and son, you both eat well.

511
00:47:33,223 --> 00:47:35,599
Is he planning Temple Run?

512
00:47:35,724 --> 00:47:38,890
-Hello!
-Sir we are calling from Gramina bank.

513
00:47:38,932 --> 00:47:42,348
We'll give you a loan to
buy cow or sheep, sir.

514
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:44,181
There is a lot of sheep here already.

515
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,515
No thanks!

516
00:47:48,557 --> 00:47:51,016
He keeps having all the nice pieces.

517
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:54,307
-What does your father do?
-He's a father, uncle.

518
00:47:55,016 --> 00:47:58,515
-Talk properly.
-Church father, uncle.

519
00:47:59,098 --> 00:48:01,599
Why is he sending you to college?

520
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,140
-To get educated.
-Then why are you begging here?

521
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:06,974
Eat!

522
00:48:08,515 --> 00:48:12,181
Why are you shouting?
Don't listen to him. You guys eat.

523
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:15,682
Would you please stop!
I'm talking here, right?

524
00:48:15,974 --> 00:48:20,057
If you don't study when you can,
this is how your wife will treat you.

525
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:22,307
You concentrate on studies.

526
00:48:22,557 --> 00:48:26,016
No need to take over the wedding hall.
I'll take care of it.

527
00:48:26,682 --> 00:48:29,682
I know how great care you take.

528
00:48:29,682 --> 00:48:31,932
-Want some <i>rasam</i>?
-On his head!

529
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,724
Why would I? Eat.

530
00:48:33,974 --> 00:48:37,724
You won't listen to anyone
else, but to each other.

531
00:48:37,765 --> 00:48:39,890
-What?
-Nothing!

532
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,682
Don't listen to hi. Do as you wish.

533
00:48:43,682 --> 00:48:45,557
Shut up!
I'll slap you across your face!

534
00:48:47,223 --> 00:48:50,390
-I'm dealing with them, right?
-Such a great dealing!

535
00:48:50,432 --> 00:48:52,057
Damn you!

536
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:56,181
No one values me anymore.
Not even the kids.

537
00:48:56,765 --> 00:48:59,016
I won't stay in this
house even for a second.

538
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,640
Go hit your head now.

539
00:49:09,016 --> 00:49:10,265
Ask me to stop.

540
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:12,807
You eat!

541
00:49:18,557 --> 00:49:22,557
Listen... I have been
watching you for 20 years...

542
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,682
You are strong-headed
than your grandpa.

543
00:49:27,432 --> 00:49:31,682
If you want to do something,
you go do it my hook or crook.

544
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:34,765
Here.

545
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:39,307
From now on,
this wedding hall belongs to you.

546
00:49:40,016 --> 00:49:41,599
Ok? Hmm?

547
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,016
What brings all the geniuses here?

548
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:55,599
Nothing, sir. Everyone is going
out for 4-1 project, right?

549
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,432
We too want to take up
a project here, sir.

550
00:49:58,473 --> 00:50:01,307
-What project?
-Our SR Wedding hall is there, right sir?

551
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:04,849
We want to re-open it
and plan weddings, sir.

552
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:07,932
-Seriously?
-We have business mindsets, sir.

553
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:09,807
So we want to do business.

554
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:12,724
What year you are in?

555
00:50:12,765 --> 00:50:15,098
-6th year, sir.
-6th year!

556
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,724
How many more years are you planning?

557
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,807
As it's not working out,
I want to do business, sir.

558
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,223
Business!

559
00:50:22,223 --> 00:50:25,974
You are the most foolish students I
have ever seen in my entire service.

560
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,390
I'll be the first one to be
happy if you leave the college.

561
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,807
Because at least 40 students
will study well without you here.

562
00:50:35,223 --> 00:50:36,515
Am I right?

563
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:39,807
What can I answer for that, sir?

564
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:41,307
Ok, do as you wish.

565
00:50:42,016 --> 00:50:43,140
Go.

566
00:50:45,307 --> 00:50:47,223
Are you paying condonation again?

567
00:50:47,265 --> 00:50:49,057
We have nothing to do with that now.

568
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,348
How are you doing, grandpa?

569
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:47,390
We are B.Tech students.
Well educated.

570
00:51:47,515 --> 00:51:54,016
We are planning grand weddings in our wedding
hall. First of its kind in Raichut.

571
00:51:54,181 --> 00:51:57,473
We heard that sister is getting married.
Please give us that event.

572
00:51:57,515 --> 00:52:02,016
We'll plan sister's wedding on a
grand scale in SR Wedding hall.

573
00:52:02,016 --> 00:52:05,432
Get the hell out of here.
Who will get married in your wedding hall?

574
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:08,265
Are they here?

575
00:52:08,515 --> 00:52:10,807
They are not the saree selling boys.
Someone else.

576
00:52:11,515 --> 00:52:14,515
-Tell me.
-My name is Kalyan, uncle.

577
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:20,724
Who gets married there? If you want
to, let's have a liquor party.

578
00:52:28,473 --> 00:52:30,807
-Aunty, we are from SR...
-I need nothing.

579
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:38,932
We don't want any washroom cleaner.

580
00:52:40,682 --> 00:52:43,432
This is not the dress effect.
This is our face effect.

581
00:52:43,849 --> 00:52:46,432
Do we look that cheap!

582
00:52:46,473 --> 00:52:49,640
Do we look like someone who
will clean washrooms, aunty?

583
00:52:49,765 --> 00:52:51,432
Not so much.

584
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:53,807
Namasthe, aunty. My name is Kalyan.

585
00:52:55,057 --> 00:52:58,348
We heard that your son is getting married.
If you can hand us that event...

586
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,890
Do you know anything about
the marriage rituals?

587
00:53:01,057 --> 00:53:03,265
Marriage rituals!

588
00:53:03,307 --> 00:53:06,849
You can get married,
but not arrange marriages.

589
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,932
Go learn how to get
someone married. Go.

590
00:54:17,847 --> 00:54:19,014
Come here, son.

591
00:54:19,181 --> 00:54:20,515
What?

592
00:54:20,556 --> 00:54:21,722
Go!

593
00:54:26,098 --> 00:54:29,473
You seem easily 30.
Go get married first.

594
00:54:32,889 --> 00:54:35,181
You seem easily 30!

595
00:54:38,556 --> 00:54:42,014
Bro, don't look at me that seriously.
I feel even funnier.

596
00:54:45,306 --> 00:54:50,264
Did you see the old man last night?
He went back not knowing about a buffet.

597
00:54:50,306 --> 00:54:54,639
They spend lakhs on the wedding,
but no one respects the guests.

598
00:54:55,722 --> 00:54:58,931
Bro, think about who will
give us a wedding event.

599
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,264
Why are we not getting at
least one idea that works!

600
00:55:15,014 --> 00:55:17,722
Hey... I got an idea.

601
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:44,056
Don't look at us like we
are a bunch of idiots.

602
00:55:44,223 --> 00:55:46,556
Thanks for expecting our invitation.

603
00:55:46,556 --> 00:55:48,473
That's not 'Expecting',
it's 'Accepting'.

604
00:55:49,931 --> 00:55:52,098
Sister, can I talk?

605
00:55:52,139 --> 00:55:54,056
Of course,
that's what you are here for, right?

606
00:55:54,098 --> 00:55:55,722
You... What's with her, brother?

607
00:55:56,014 --> 00:56:00,056
You might be wondering what we
are doing out of the college.

608
00:56:00,181 --> 00:56:01,515
We never wondered.

609
00:56:03,389 --> 00:56:06,098
We are planning to arrange
weddings in our hall.

610
00:56:08,473 --> 00:56:09,931
Rajini, what's your problem?

611
00:56:10,056 --> 00:56:12,722
-We are not talking about your wedding.
-Ok, I'll leave then.

612
00:56:12,764 --> 00:56:13,931
Brother, calm down.

613
00:56:13,972 --> 00:56:16,098
Rajini, sit. Please sit.

614
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:20,014
Not just you. Everyone is laughing at
20-year-old guys arranging weddings.

615
00:56:20,014 --> 00:56:22,223
20? He's 24-year-old, right?

616
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:29,014
I understand...
You guys are taking revenge on us.

617
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:31,348
Please listen to me for a while.

618
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:33,806
After that, I'll pray for
you as long as you want.

619
00:56:34,764 --> 00:56:36,556
If you feel like smiling, please control.

620
00:56:37,431 --> 00:56:39,972
Who among you remember
the 90s marriages?

621
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:44,889
You might have seen your relatives
getting married, right? Do you remember?

622
00:56:45,764 --> 00:56:47,597
According to me,
those are the real marriages.

623
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:50,972
These days weddings look
like birthday events.

624
00:56:51,764 --> 00:56:57,764
I used to eat well, flirt with some girls,
and come back home from the wedding.

625
00:56:58,473 --> 00:57:02,431
The minute we planned to take up the
wedding hall and plan weddings...

626
00:57:02,473 --> 00:57:04,639
We took a look at the weddings today.

627
00:57:04,806 --> 00:57:09,181
Not even one of them made us remember
those weddings of our childhood.

628
00:57:09,181 --> 00:57:10,680
The wedding system changed a lot.

629
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:14,972
Why will we even go meet someone
and invite them to the wedding?

630
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:18,264
If they come to the wedding
to bless our children...

631
00:57:18,348 --> 00:57:20,972
We would welcome them
with love and respect...

632
00:57:21,056 --> 00:57:24,348
And give them good food
and great hospitality.

633
00:57:24,431 --> 00:57:28,931
But now, we even send the
invitations through WhatsApp.

634
00:57:29,223 --> 00:57:33,556
Who's receiving them?
Who's taking care if they ate?

635
00:57:33,556 --> 00:57:36,056
And only God knows about
the love and respect.

636
00:57:36,515 --> 00:57:40,764
I still remember,
if someone is getting married...

637
00:57:40,806 --> 00:57:44,389
Everyone used to go see the new bride.

638
00:57:44,431 --> 00:57:49,680
They used to gather around
her and praise her beauty.

639
00:57:49,847 --> 00:57:53,306
Such a greath thing to do!

640
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:56,806
She used to have an introduction
not less than a heroine.

641
00:57:56,889 --> 00:57:58,680
But weddings these days...

642
00:57:58,722 --> 00:58:02,348
No one even has an interest
to look at the couple.

643
00:58:02,597 --> 00:58:07,139
They come in, look at the LCD
screens, and leave.

644
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:11,764
If someone even wanted to go see,
the photographers won't let you.

645
00:58:11,972 --> 00:58:14,639
That's how it is these days.

646
00:58:15,556 --> 00:58:18,056
Do you know about the First Couple?

647
00:58:18,972 --> 00:58:22,764
The very first couple in this universe
are Lord Shiva and Mother Parvathi.

648
00:58:23,181 --> 00:58:27,223
With the bride and groom
on the wedding aisle...

649
00:58:27,389 --> 00:58:31,389
With everyone looking at them, they turn
into Lord Shiva and Mother Parvathi.

650
00:58:31,431 --> 00:58:34,722
That's why they compare the bride
and groom with the First Couple.

651
00:58:35,139 --> 00:58:38,264
Now everyone looks down
on our SR Wedding hall.

652
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:43,764
But once my grandpa built it
on the most auspicious day.

653
00:58:43,806 --> 00:58:48,639
That's why no wedding that took
place there ended in divorce.

654
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:52,639
The same way my grandpa
arranged weddings back then...

655
00:58:52,806 --> 00:58:58,556
We are planning to bring
those olden days back.

656
00:58:58,806 --> 00:59:01,680
Give us a chance.
No one outside has trust in us.

657
00:59:01,847 --> 00:59:04,098
We heard that many of you
are getting married soon.

658
00:59:04,098 --> 00:59:07,680
That's why we are here.
At least you guys should believe in us.

659
00:59:10,556 --> 00:59:12,722
Kalyan, your speech about
weddings felt so nice.

660
00:59:12,764 --> 00:59:14,847
No one wants to marry me.

661
00:59:14,889 --> 00:59:17,515
If someone does, I'll get married
in your wedding hall for sure.

662
00:59:17,556 --> 00:59:19,806
No one is going to accept her.

663
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,348
Why don't you do that?

664
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,056
-Pass this news to your families too, OK?
-Tell your friends too.

665
00:59:26,139 --> 00:59:27,431
Send that short girl's contact.

666
00:59:27,473 --> 00:59:31,264
-Our contact is in there.
-Such a great observation about weddings!

667
00:59:31,722 --> 00:59:33,056
Kalyan...

668
00:59:33,389 --> 00:59:35,056
You stopped caring about me!

669
00:59:35,098 --> 00:59:36,431
Did you eat, Sindhu?

670
00:59:36,597 --> 00:59:38,556
This is how you have
become a dog in my eyes.

671
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,931
Tell me this...
Why did you fight with my dad?

672
00:59:41,014 --> 00:59:44,847
Forget about that. It's been so long...
Talk something about us.

673
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:47,597
There's nothing between
us to talk about.

674
00:59:47,847 --> 00:59:49,264
Nothing!

675
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:51,931
Nothing.

676
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,056
Tell this to everyone in the college.
I'll hook up with some other guy.

677
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:02,139
People think that I'm your lover.

678
01:00:10,764 --> 01:00:14,014
Kalyan, principal sir is calling you.

679
01:00:14,056 --> 01:00:17,223
-Seriously?
-As if I enjoy taking you there.

680
01:00:17,348 --> 01:00:18,847
He's calling you. Come on.

681
01:00:18,847 --> 01:00:20,806
Damn!

682
01:00:20,889 --> 01:00:24,431
Forget about others. First, you think of me
as your lover and everything will be ok.

683
01:00:24,515 --> 01:00:27,764
I'm in the middle of something. I'll
come back and will follow you like a dog.

684
01:00:32,931 --> 01:00:36,348
That's it, Kalyan. I'm not giving you
a wedding. I'm giving you a problem.

685
01:00:36,515 --> 01:00:39,597
You have to solve it and get
the wedding done. Will you?

686
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,597
-We will, sir.
-Think again!

687
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:45,806
[all]: We will, sir.

688
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:52,098
With punctual and good students,
I feel like being the Principal.

689
01:00:52,972 --> 01:00:55,306
With idiots like you...

690
01:00:55,556 --> 01:00:57,806
I feel like they are my friends.

691
01:00:57,889 --> 01:00:59,722
I just got goosebumps, sir.

692
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,139
Is it?

693
01:01:02,515 --> 01:01:04,806
I'll pay half for the wedding. Ok?

694
01:01:06,098 --> 01:01:08,098
-[all]: Thank you, sir.
-Good. You can leave.

695
01:01:10,806 --> 01:01:12,515
Kalyan, one minute.

696
01:01:13,181 --> 01:01:15,389
-Sir?
-One minute. Come sit.

697
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:29,306
My wedding happened in a grand
way, in your wedding hall itself.

698
01:01:30,847 --> 01:01:32,722
Many more weddings have to happen there.

699
01:01:33,722 --> 01:01:37,680
Your wedding hall has to see
the good olden days again.

700
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:42,348
You have to do it.
Only you can do it. All the best!

701
01:01:46,806 --> 01:01:47,972
I will, sir.

702
01:02:01,556 --> 01:02:02,722
Jesus!

703
01:02:05,014 --> 01:02:07,889
Uncle, we are Chandrakala's
friends, uncle.

704
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:09,515
Tell me.

705
01:02:11,098 --> 01:02:14,889
We are here to talk about
Chandrakala and Arun's love.

706
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:18,014
My wife just died.
You want me to go too?

707
01:02:18,098 --> 01:02:19,348
Get lost!

708
01:02:19,431 --> 01:02:21,556
Uncle, please... Uncle!

709
01:02:22,515 --> 01:02:25,348
-Uncle, just a minute.
-Hey, Kalyan...

710
01:02:25,556 --> 01:02:28,098
He became an alcohol addict
after his wife's death.

711
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:30,223
He's not coming out they say. Let's go.

712
01:02:30,389 --> 01:02:31,764
How can we leave him so?

713
01:02:32,098 --> 01:02:34,680
-We have only this option left.
-Let's go.

714
01:02:35,181 --> 01:02:36,306
Uncle!

715
01:02:39,098 --> 01:02:40,847
Uncle, listen to us once, please.

716
01:02:40,889 --> 01:02:42,139
How much is this?

717
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:45,680
-There he is?
-What kind of humans are you. No!

718
01:02:59,181 --> 01:03:01,139
-Uncle...
-You fools!

719
01:03:01,181 --> 01:03:05,680
What will you get from
roaming around me? Fools!

720
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:20,223
Saroja, my dad got me married at 19.

721
01:03:20,473 --> 01:03:22,597
You have gone after another 19 years.

722
01:03:23,139 --> 01:03:25,931
Where will I go at 38 years of age?

723
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:28,806
Our daughter is not even
at an age to get married.

724
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,889
She's already getting matches.

725
01:03:31,889 --> 01:03:33,515
He seems to be emotional right
now, bro.

726
01:03:33,515 --> 01:03:35,764
Give me something that will get me high!

727
01:03:48,972 --> 01:03:50,098
Uncle!

728
01:03:50,264 --> 01:03:51,473
Uncle!

729
01:03:54,139 --> 01:03:55,680
Nice growth!

730
01:03:58,014 --> 01:03:59,306
Uncle...

731
01:03:59,847 --> 01:04:03,889
-God, he's here!
-Who's that? Who the hell is that!

732
01:04:04,181 --> 01:04:09,181
[commotion]

733
01:04:09,639 --> 01:04:11,597
All my high is gone!

734
01:04:19,597 --> 01:04:21,056
Uncle.

735
01:04:23,056 --> 01:04:27,847
[all]: Uncle, five minutes, uncle!

736
01:04:28,056 --> 01:04:29,056
Uncle!

737
01:04:30,056 --> 01:04:31,515
What is he doing here?

738
01:04:35,098 --> 01:04:39,014
Cool... Your son seems like he'll
be a better success than me.

739
01:04:39,473 --> 01:04:41,556
Very close to being a beggar!

740
01:04:41,556 --> 01:04:44,597
The way he's begging!

741
01:04:45,139 --> 01:04:48,515
I told you not to give him our
gold, but you did.

742
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:50,931
I at least gave you a house to stay.

743
01:04:51,931 --> 01:04:55,847
With him in the play...
we are going onto the road soon.

744
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:04,556
You bloody women!

745
01:05:06,389 --> 01:05:10,223
Even if it's raining or scorching
heat, all you need is gossip.

746
01:05:10,348 --> 01:05:12,056
Go to your houses!

747
01:05:21,264 --> 01:05:22,306
Uncle.

748
01:05:30,014 --> 01:05:31,806
You won't even let me
take a leak in peace!

749
01:05:32,098 --> 01:05:36,306
Sir, please, sir.
Give us two minutes to talk to you, sir.

750
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:38,806
Look at my situation!
What do you even want?

751
01:05:38,806 --> 01:05:43,056
-Try to understand...
-Look at the location and the situation!

752
01:05:43,056 --> 01:05:46,847
-What do you want?
-We want five minutes of your time, sir.

753
01:05:47,056 --> 01:05:49,515
Morning... Come to my
house at sharp 10 O'Clock.

754
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:57,764
-I said 10!
-As we don't believe you!

755
01:05:59,431 --> 01:06:02,181
With this dedication,
you would have been a collector.

756
01:06:02,181 --> 01:06:03,306
Yes, uncle.

757
01:06:04,264 --> 01:06:05,931
What? Shouldn't I be a collector?

758
01:06:07,098 --> 01:06:09,056
Ok, go on. What do you want to say?

759
01:06:09,056 --> 01:06:10,639
The emotional part is his, uncle.

760
01:06:14,306 --> 01:06:17,098
Sorry for troubling you, sir.

761
01:06:17,972 --> 01:06:22,348
We can understand how lonely
you got after your wife's death.

762
01:06:23,473 --> 01:06:26,972
As your daughter has to do the
household chores if she's here...

763
01:06:27,098 --> 01:06:29,722
You sent her away to the hostel, sir.

764
01:06:30,139 --> 01:06:35,014
We know that you don't want to
get her married to an orphan, sir.

765
01:06:35,389 --> 01:06:36,597
But...

766
01:06:36,889 --> 01:06:40,264
Even we never thought that
would love each other this much.

767
01:06:40,389 --> 01:06:44,014
We are seeing from the last three years.
They love each other a lot, sir.

768
01:06:44,181 --> 01:06:45,847
And about Arun...

769
01:06:45,931 --> 01:06:48,306
He's the first one who bagged
a job from our college, sir.

770
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:50,056
A very nice person, sir.

771
01:06:50,556 --> 01:06:53,597
You feel lonely in the memories
of your dead wife, sir.

772
01:06:54,515 --> 01:06:56,515
Don't let your daughter
go through the same, sir.

773
01:06:56,556 --> 01:07:00,264
This might sound a little
sarcastic, but...

774
01:07:01,972 --> 01:07:03,223
We are here for them, sir.

775
01:07:04,431 --> 01:07:07,181
She never told me how
much she loves him.

776
01:07:07,181 --> 01:07:08,348
She didn't?

777
01:07:08,389 --> 01:07:12,556
She said she loves him and he's an orphan.
That's it.

778
01:07:15,139 --> 01:07:18,139
Ladies can't open up with
their fathers, right?

779
01:07:19,389 --> 01:07:22,389
Maybe she thought I'm a
drunkard and I have no heart.

780
01:07:23,264 --> 01:07:26,223
-Drunkards are the ones with heart.
-[all]: Right, uncle.

781
01:07:26,431 --> 01:07:28,556
-Do you drink?
-[all]: We do, uncle.

782
01:07:28,556 --> 01:07:31,722
-What brand?
-According to the budget...

783
01:07:31,722 --> 01:07:33,722
Ok. What shall we do now?

784
01:07:33,764 --> 01:07:35,056
[all]: Let's get them married, uncle.

785
01:07:35,098 --> 01:07:38,223
Trivikram wedding hall in
the town is a good hall.

786
01:07:38,431 --> 01:07:39,680
Shall I book it?

787
01:07:43,722 --> 01:07:45,847
What happened?
Why do you look like that?

788
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:16,847
When my grandpa is arranging marriages,
once the names get into the register...

789
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:19,931
No matter what,
he used to get that wedding done.

790
01:08:20,389 --> 01:08:25,764
That's the first rule we
have to follow from now on.

791
01:09:12,972 --> 01:09:14,473
I can't, bro!

792
01:10:08,181 --> 01:10:09,806
Where's the wedding hall?

793
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:13,098
Where else? All the weddings are
happening in SR Wedding hall these days.

794
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:55,680
-Son...
-Tell me...

795
01:10:56,847 --> 01:10:59,680
You dad feel bad that
you don't talk to him.

796
01:11:12,847 --> 01:11:15,014
-Sir, are you the bride's uncle?
-Yeah.

797
01:11:15,014 --> 01:11:17,014
-Come serve the food.
-What are you talking about?

798
01:11:17,556 --> 01:11:19,306
Why will I serve the food?

799
01:11:19,473 --> 01:11:21,806
Did my brother-in-law got
miserly and avoided catering?

800
01:11:22,847 --> 01:11:25,722
Nothing like that, sir.
During your wedding, your niece...

801
01:11:25,889 --> 01:11:28,847
She did little works with
her little hands, remember?

802
01:11:28,972 --> 01:11:31,473
Then why can't you serve
food at her wedding, sir?

803
01:11:31,473 --> 01:11:33,181
Come on, sir.

804
01:12:42,139 --> 01:12:45,056
Damn it! It's a wrong idea to slap her.

805
01:12:45,098 --> 01:12:48,389
She won't answer my calls
or reply to my messages. Damn!

806
01:12:49,597 --> 01:12:51,139
What happened, brother?

807
01:12:52,056 --> 01:12:53,556
Why don't you drink in happiness?

808
01:12:56,931 --> 01:13:01,639
She won't fall for you...
Why be disappointed about all this?

809
01:13:03,348 --> 01:13:04,722
Why won't she fall for me?

810
01:13:05,389 --> 01:13:09,139
Why do you keep saying that
she won't fall for me? Why!

811
01:13:10,556 --> 01:13:12,223
Look at me an answer.

812
01:13:12,264 --> 01:13:15,556
I am saying for your own good.
Do as you wish.

813
01:13:15,972 --> 01:13:17,680
Do you expect me to calm you down?

814
01:13:18,139 --> 01:13:19,972
Tell me. Answer my question!

815
01:13:21,847 --> 01:13:23,264
Tell me, why won't she fall for me?

816
01:13:27,098 --> 01:13:28,972
Tell me, why won't Sindhu fall for me?

817
01:13:29,431 --> 01:13:32,306
Dhinu, come here. Tell me...

818
01:13:32,556 --> 01:13:34,764
-You both are made for each other.
-Tell him that.

819
01:13:35,181 --> 01:13:37,306
-You both are made for each other.
-Say that again.

820
01:13:37,389 --> 01:13:39,056
They both are made for each other.

821
01:13:41,139 --> 01:13:43,473
-Sindhu and me are...
-Made for each other.

822
01:13:43,473 --> 01:13:45,556
-Say it.
-They both are made for each other.

823
01:13:45,597 --> 01:13:48,889
-Make senior understand.
-They are made for each other!

824
01:13:49,597 --> 01:13:54,139
Sindhu and me are made for each other.

825
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,014
You alone are enough to spoil his life.

826
01:13:58,889 --> 01:14:00,515
Pick him up. I'll go pay the bill.

827
01:14:00,556 --> 01:14:04,431
Forget about him. I'm telling you.
You both are made for each other.

828
01:14:05,181 --> 01:14:06,597
Thanks, dude!

829
01:14:07,348 --> 01:14:13,223
Me and Sindhu are made for each other.

830
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,056
Brother...

831
01:14:15,139 --> 01:14:17,931
Move! What are you doing?

832
01:14:20,056 --> 01:14:22,264
-What?
-There's someone here for you.

833
01:14:22,264 --> 01:14:24,722
-Who?
-He said he's your friend.

834
01:14:25,515 --> 01:14:28,515
My friend? Who's he!

835
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,473
Dhinu, how are you!

836
01:15:17,515 --> 01:15:20,223
-Been so long...
-Hey Dhinu... What's that?

837
01:15:20,389 --> 01:15:22,223
How many years it had been!

838
01:15:22,348 --> 01:15:25,431
You used to say that we are best
friends and now you forgot me.

839
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,931
-Rich people!
-Nothing like that, man.

840
01:15:27,972 --> 01:15:31,139
I was trying for your contact and
now I found it. How are you doing?

841
01:15:31,181 --> 01:15:34,056
Good that you got it.
Look at you... Come on!

842
01:15:34,056 --> 01:15:36,306
-Come on, man.

843
01:15:36,806 --> 01:15:40,264
-They say you are arranging marriages.
-Yeah, we just started. Why do you ask?

844
01:15:42,014 --> 01:15:45,264
What? What's the matter?

845
01:15:45,847 --> 01:15:48,473
-Tell me.
-You have to arrange my wedding too.

846
01:15:49,389 --> 01:15:53,139
You... You're getting married. Dude!

847
01:15:53,473 --> 01:15:57,264
You're getting married! I'll introduce
you to my friends. Let's rock this.

848
01:15:58,348 --> 01:16:00,389
I was never this hungover in life.

849
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,722
Thinking about what's
not ours does that, bro.

850
01:16:03,306 --> 01:16:04,473
Let's go.

851
01:16:04,764 --> 01:16:07,223
[chatter]

852
01:16:07,306 --> 01:16:12,264
Guys, he's the childhood friend
I always tell you about. Sankeerth.

853
01:16:12,389 --> 01:16:13,806
When did he tell us?

854
01:16:13,847 --> 01:16:15,348
Same doubt!

855
01:16:15,515 --> 01:16:17,473
I know this is not a great news.

856
01:16:17,515 --> 01:16:20,680
But I do have a great news.
He's getting married.

857
01:16:21,431 --> 01:16:25,556
For me and you guys, he's going to
get married in our SR Wedding hall.

858
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:29,764
We have to rock his wedding. Kalyan...

859
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,889
-Tell us how you'll plan it.
-It's your friend, right? It'll be good.

860
01:16:34,139 --> 01:16:35,473
I can't hear you. Louder!

861
01:16:35,515 --> 01:16:39,014
-We'll rock it.
-That's it. That's my boy...

862
01:16:39,014 --> 01:16:40,556
-Your house name...
-Sattu.

863
01:16:40,764 --> 01:16:44,806
Sattu Sankeerth's wedding should be
remembered for ages. Satti, come here.

864
01:16:44,806 --> 01:16:46,515
Why is he overacting?

865
01:16:47,014 --> 01:16:48,639
Come on...

866
01:16:48,931 --> 01:16:51,680
We have rock my friend's wedding.
Give him the details.

867
01:16:52,764 --> 01:16:55,680
Come on, give the details fast.
Enter them in the register.

868
01:16:56,431 --> 01:16:59,556
Satti, write it in bold letters.

869
01:16:59,722 --> 01:17:02,556
-What the hell!
-Why are you so mad about me?

870
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:06,889
You did so much for me, dude.
We even shared underwear!

871
01:17:09,431 --> 01:17:11,556
Bro, can we see her photo?

872
01:17:11,597 --> 01:17:15,597
He always wants to see photos
of the bride and the groom.

873
01:17:17,389 --> 01:17:22,556
Based on your previous track,
she would be really beautiful.

874
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:24,264
How do you know all that!

875
01:17:32,098 --> 01:17:35,014
I know you haven't seen such a girl
in this entire district, right?

876
01:17:35,056 --> 01:17:36,264
Such a beauty?

877
01:17:36,389 --> 01:17:38,264
That's how my friend's selection is.

878
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:41,931
-Hey, control your excitement.
-How do I control that, brother?

879
01:17:41,972 --> 01:17:44,556
-He's my childhood friend, brother.
-Let me have a look, brother.

880
01:17:45,223 --> 01:17:47,931
Give it. Come on!

881
01:17:54,972 --> 01:17:57,431
What, Kalyan? Do you feel jealous?

882
01:17:59,306 --> 01:18:01,680
Dhinu, take a look at the photo once.

883
01:18:01,722 --> 01:18:03,889
Hey, why should I take
a look at the photo?

884
01:18:03,931 --> 01:18:06,722
-Please do.
-I taught him how to select girls.

885
01:18:06,764 --> 01:18:07,889
Take a look!

886
01:18:08,223 --> 01:18:10,014
Is he still feeling jealous?

887
01:18:10,889 --> 01:18:14,056
Bro, I hope you'll make
the wedding a grand event.

888
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:16,515
I'm telling you, we'll rock.
It will be sick. Come on.

889
01:18:16,764 --> 01:18:19,473
Oh, Lord Jesus! What's with this twist?

890
01:18:21,806 --> 01:18:27,223
Best package ever done in our wedding
hall. Come on, give me a hug...

891
01:18:34,639 --> 01:18:36,597
Bro, I beg you!

892
01:18:36,639 --> 01:18:39,014
I have nothing to do with this.

893
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:44,722
You made a fool out of me,
saying that we are made for each other!

894
01:18:45,056 --> 01:18:49,348
Who the hell is he?
Who's that Sattu Sankeerth?

895
01:18:49,639 --> 01:18:52,306
Shut up!

896
01:18:52,556 --> 01:18:56,515
-Childhood friend. Give me a minute!
-Where are you going!

897
01:18:57,931 --> 01:19:01,473
I kissed you in a towel!
Who the hell is he?

898
01:19:01,515 --> 01:19:03,348
-I have no idea.
-How can Sindhu get married?

899
01:19:03,597 --> 01:19:07,139
-How can she?
-Dude, I have no idea about this.

900
01:19:07,181 --> 01:19:08,931
I have no idea about this!

901
01:19:09,139 --> 01:19:13,181
-He just said he's getting married.
-What the hell!

902
01:19:14,098 --> 01:19:17,847
-I have no idea, dude!
-How can Sindhu get married, dude.

903
01:19:18,056 --> 01:19:20,264
Did he enter the names in the register?

904
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:09,487
Hey, Sindhu...

905
01:20:11,844 --> 01:20:14,172
What, Kalyan? It's been so
long since you came to college.

906
01:20:14,197 --> 01:20:16,540
Her father met with an accident.
Sent her out fast, madam.

907
01:20:16,565 --> 01:20:18,928
-Sindhu...
-I'll go after the lab, madam.

908
01:20:19,013 --> 01:20:21,638
Madam, he's breathing
his last in the hospital.

909
01:20:21,839 --> 01:20:23,948
It seems serious. Go.

910
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:25,917
I'll go in the lunch break, madam.

911
01:20:31,939 --> 01:20:36,001
Girls these days have no respect
towards parents or boyfriends, madam.

912
01:20:39,211 --> 01:20:40,625
Are you kidding me?

913
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:43,402
Do I look so cheap to you,
just because I follow you every day?

914
01:20:44,305 --> 01:20:48,281
You know... I have been in love
with you for the last three years.

915
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:50,542
What?

916
01:20:51,035 --> 01:20:54,566
You are getting married to
someone else in my wedding hall!

917
01:20:54,811 --> 01:20:56,170
Is this a joke?

918
01:20:58,936 --> 01:21:00,530
What the hell!

919
01:21:00,996 --> 01:21:04,262
Step back!
Did I ever tell you that I love you?

920
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:06,508
Stay away from me.

921
01:21:07,605 --> 01:21:10,144
And be in your limits. Don't overact.

922
01:21:10,797 --> 01:21:12,617
You'll always be a dog in my eyes.

923
01:21:17,559 --> 01:21:20,801
True. You treated me like a dog.

924
01:21:22,186 --> 01:21:25,342
It's me who took you for granted.

925
01:21:25,367 --> 01:21:27,515
Good that you have
realized that at least now.

926
01:21:30,676 --> 01:21:34,183
You are getting married to
someone else in my wedding hall!

927
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,798
I'll see...

928
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:40,005
I slapped you as I thought
you are mine. Sorry!

929
01:21:42,838 --> 01:21:44,330
Kalyan!

930
01:21:45,915 --> 01:21:47,087
Kalyan!

931
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:52,130
Kalyan!

932
01:21:53,273 --> 01:21:54,429
Kalyan!

933
01:21:58,773 --> 01:22:03,328
Do my cheek look so free to you...
You keep slapping it all the time!

934
01:22:04,903 --> 01:22:06,606
Won't you ever listen to me?

935
01:22:07,397 --> 01:22:11,069
So you are really planning to get
me married in your wedding hall?

936
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:14,206
Have you ever listened to me?

937
01:22:14,682 --> 01:22:18,244
You'll come, talk about my
hips, shout at me and leave.

938
01:22:19,166 --> 01:22:20,728
You even started
slapping me these days.

939
01:22:21,354 --> 01:22:23,760
You stopped caring about me
from the last two months!

940
01:22:24,295 --> 01:22:26,272
Do you think I want
to have this marriage?

941
01:22:27,483 --> 01:22:28,928
I don't want it.

942
01:22:29,833 --> 01:22:33,004
My dad decided this
the minute I was born.

943
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:36,208
He fixed this even without asking me.

944
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:40,556
I was trying to ask you to
stop this wedding and you...

945
01:23:08,851 --> 01:23:12,445
Sindhu, I can't control this anymore.
Can I touch your hips?

946
01:27:02,644 --> 01:27:06,043
Jesus, why do you show me something
I really don't want to see!

947
01:27:06,808 --> 01:27:09,394
Hey, close that man. Couldn't watch it!

948
01:27:09,593 --> 01:27:11,038
Damn! Tell him, brother...

949
01:27:11,417 --> 01:27:14,722
I drank six beers and told you
with a lot of confidence...

950
01:27:14,967 --> 01:27:17,389
That you will spoil his life one day.

951
01:27:18,678 --> 01:27:21,428
Don't look like that, bro.
I feel pity for you.

952
01:27:21,787 --> 01:27:23,052
Take this...

953
01:27:24,248 --> 01:27:29,443
By the time he's here, say your
grandparents are not well and leave.

954
01:27:29,663 --> 01:27:31,600
[Kalyan singing]

955
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:41,257
Hey, Dhinu...

956
01:27:51,418 --> 01:27:54,903
Dhinu, did I ever ask you for anything?

957
01:27:55,177 --> 01:27:56,560
As per my knowledge, no!

958
01:27:57,792 --> 01:28:00,495
You used to tell me something
all the time. What's that?

959
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,893
You and Sindhu... Made for each other.

960
01:28:04,383 --> 01:28:05,719
That came true, brother.

961
01:28:07,421 --> 01:28:09,296
-Seriously?
-Yeah, brother.

962
01:28:09,762 --> 01:28:13,106
-He sealed it with a hug.
-But she thinks of you like a dog, right?

963
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:16,486
-That's why she kissed me too, brother.
-What the hell!

964
01:28:16,711 --> 01:28:19,227
-Because she loves me.
-What about the wedding with Sattu?

965
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:22,036
-Because her father arranged it.
-Oh my Lord!

966
01:28:22,276 --> 01:28:24,729
So how can this poor boy help you now?

967
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:26,718
This poor boy has to do everything.

968
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:31,817
Dhinu, Sindhu can't tell her dad
that she doesn't want this marriage.

969
01:28:31,842 --> 01:28:34,794
That's how their bonding is.
For me to tell him about it...

970
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,679
You know we are not
on such good terms.

971
01:28:38,176 --> 01:28:43,246
For all this to happen,
your childhood friend Sattu Sankeerth...

972
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:46,541
He has to say that he
don't want this wedding.

973
01:28:47,479 --> 01:28:50,417
This means this wedding should
seem like it's happening...

974
01:28:50,442 --> 01:28:51,876
But it shouldn't.

975
01:28:51,901 --> 01:28:55,444
For that to happen,
you have to tell us what to do.

976
01:28:55,698 --> 01:29:00,652
So he's the one who
decides everything now.

977
01:29:01,539 --> 01:29:05,273
Oh, God! Such a huge responsibility!

978
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:09,549
Will he support his childhood friend?

979
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:12,526
Or the B.Tech friend
he has beers with?

980
01:29:12,551 --> 01:29:14,237
[both]: Tell us!

981
01:29:14,736 --> 01:29:17,830
Can anyone in this world
answer this question?

982
01:29:25,061 --> 01:29:28,404
Is Dharma the same? Or did he change?

983
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,206
No change, sister...

984
01:29:30,822 --> 01:29:33,736
He's even getting worse by the day.

985
01:29:34,515 --> 01:29:38,273
If I say something,
he drinks more than usual that day.

986
01:29:38,935 --> 01:29:40,685
And he keeps fighting with us.

987
01:29:41,905 --> 01:29:43,960
Nothing changed, sister.

988
01:29:44,999 --> 01:29:50,139
Let's talk the truth...
Just as I thought, Kalyan did it.

989
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:53,038
He got successful.

990
01:29:56,821 --> 01:29:59,587
It's raining marriages
in SR Wedding hall.

991
01:30:05,877 --> 01:30:10,002
Nothing, Dharma... My relatives'
daughter's marriage got fixed.

992
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:12,416
My son went to book the wedding hall.

993
01:30:12,924 --> 01:30:14,737
They said the dates are not free.

994
01:30:15,227 --> 01:30:17,212
Can you talk to Kalyan about this?

995
01:30:18,247 --> 01:30:21,099
How much will you eat?
Wash your hand.

996
01:30:27,042 --> 01:30:31,964
We'll stay when we are here the next time.
Brother-in-law...

997
01:30:32,233 --> 01:30:33,929
Take care of our Shanti.

998
01:30:38,802 --> 01:30:43,090
She's saying that she will leave.
Ask them to stay.

999
01:30:43,115 --> 01:30:45,716
Let them go. They have to milk
the cows in the morning, right?

1000
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:48,567
Take care...

1001
01:30:50,321 --> 01:30:54,868
This is what he does all the time.
Bloody!

1002
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,506
Why do you hate my relatives?

1003
01:30:57,531 --> 01:30:59,176
You keep nagging them.

1004
01:30:59,201 --> 01:31:02,151
-Can't you keep calm?
-I can't take their nonsense!

1005
01:31:02,826 --> 01:31:04,763
What did they even say?

1006
01:31:04,824 --> 01:31:08,676
He asked me to talk to my own son,
recommending a bloody wedding.

1007
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:10,935
Stop blaming him now.

1008
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:16,303
He's working hard to make his
grandpa's name great again.

1009
01:31:16,328 --> 01:31:17,975
What did YOU do?

1010
01:31:18,241 --> 01:31:22,561
You drink and die.
My son will make us proud. Get lost!

1011
01:31:22,743 --> 01:31:24,922
-[nagging]
-You get lost!

1012
01:31:25,817 --> 01:31:28,950
He's making his dead grandpa proud...

1013
01:31:29,372 --> 01:31:31,739
But he doesn't care about the
father who's still alive.

1014
01:31:32,388 --> 01:31:35,575
Don't know if he'll even
talk to my dead body!

1015
01:31:38,961 --> 01:31:40,180
Bloody!

1016
01:31:44,963 --> 01:31:48,955
Sindhu is getting engaged.
Why don't you seem to be in panic?

1017
01:31:49,459 --> 01:31:51,787
I used to have 1% doubt until yesterday.

1018
01:31:51,968 --> 01:31:54,656
After the kiss and the
clarity, why get panicked?

1019
01:31:54,859 --> 01:31:57,796
He's thinking too much about just a kiss!

1020
01:31:57,821 --> 01:31:59,523
Is it your daughter
who's getting married?

1021
01:32:00,405 --> 01:32:04,475
-No. Give me your daughter to marry.
-Sorry, the doctor said I can't have kids.

1022
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:06,983
Of course,
it's written all over your face.

1023
01:32:07,443 --> 01:32:08,677
Namasthe, uncle.

1024
01:32:08,935 --> 01:32:10,817
I thought you'll marry my daughter.

1025
01:32:10,939 --> 01:32:13,001
-Let's plan it for next time, uncle.
-Too funny!

1026
01:32:13,413 --> 01:32:14,484
God!

1027
01:32:20,623 --> 01:32:24,857
This is just the engagement!
Imagine the wedding. I'm too excited, bro.

1028
01:32:26,185 --> 01:32:27,301
Thanks, bro.

1029
01:32:27,408 --> 01:32:29,322
-Why does he look dull?
-He looks dull?

1030
01:32:29,347 --> 01:32:30,588
No, I'm good.

1031
01:32:30,917 --> 01:32:34,651
He's been thinking about
what to do and how to do it.

1032
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,322
See, he's not even sleeping well.

1033
01:32:36,527 --> 01:32:38,972
He's mad about me.
He keeps thinking about me all the time.

1034
01:32:39,424 --> 01:32:41,971
Yeah, he's mad about me too.

1035
01:32:42,196 --> 01:32:45,064
He works for my love, 24/7.

1036
01:32:45,089 --> 01:32:48,338
-Bro, you are in sync with me.
-Me? Thanks, bro.

1037
01:32:48,787 --> 01:32:51,365
You didn't see my wife, right?
Come, I'll show you.

1038
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:55,139
Sure, bro.

1039
01:32:57,261 --> 01:33:00,949
He's showing his gonna be wife to him.

1040
01:33:01,408 --> 01:33:02,463
Shut up!

1041
01:33:08,359 --> 01:33:09,719
Those eyes...

1042
01:33:10,803 --> 01:33:12,451
Seems like tasty fruits...

1043
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:15,229
Those lips...

1044
01:33:17,237 --> 01:33:18,636
Seems really great, bro.

1045
01:33:20,437 --> 01:33:21,437
That neck...

1046
01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:25,530
It's as straight as the Sanipet Bridge.

1047
01:33:26,046 --> 01:33:28,445
-Where is it located?
-No the way to our college.

1048
01:33:28,513 --> 01:33:30,294
-I have to see it.
-For sure, bro.

1049
01:33:30,319 --> 01:33:33,332
-You fool!
-Don't take me wrong, bro...

1050
01:33:34,169 --> 01:33:36,552
Her hips look so great, bro!

1051
01:33:39,152 --> 01:33:40,918
Why don't you react to this one?

1052
01:33:43,171 --> 01:33:44,453
What happened, bro?

1053
01:33:44,712 --> 01:33:46,611
Talking about a girl's hips...

1054
01:33:47,163 --> 01:33:48,351
Not right, bro.

1055
01:33:48,376 --> 01:33:50,741
-See who's talking.
-Ok.

1056
01:33:52,064 --> 01:33:56,024
-Ok.
-Your daughter-in-law studies well.

1057
01:33:57,223 --> 01:33:58,973
She's the topper in the college, right?

1058
01:34:00,532 --> 01:34:02,103
Topper of the college!

1059
01:34:02,128 --> 01:34:05,719
She might not pass M1 in this life!

1060
01:34:06,671 --> 01:34:09,827
So Paparao lied about
his daughter's talents...

1061
01:34:09,997 --> 01:34:13,880
So that he can get her married to him.

1062
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:17,360
-That's it.
-God! Where is my friend?

1063
01:34:18,878 --> 01:34:20,550
Where are you planning your honeymoon?

1064
01:34:20,592 --> 01:34:22,983
Planning?
I already booked the tickets.

1065
01:34:23,008 --> 01:34:25,451
-I am fast in things like these.
-Of course, you have to be.

1066
01:34:25,476 --> 01:34:26,662
Where is he?

1067
01:34:27,456 --> 01:34:28,784
Sankeerth...

1068
01:34:28,809 --> 01:34:31,589
-Is that your friend?
-More than that.

1069
01:34:33,375 --> 01:34:35,695
He's everything to me. Coming.

1070
01:34:37,706 --> 01:34:40,909
-Tickets confirmed?
-Yeah. With comfortable hotel stay.

1071
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:44,397
-Have you gone mad? Come with me.
-Where to?

1072
01:34:44,577 --> 01:34:46,303
Seems like friends with benefits.

1073
01:34:46,584 --> 01:34:48,834
Won't you ever change?

1074
01:34:48,991 --> 01:34:51,241
You rich guys have no brains at all!

1075
01:34:51,266 --> 01:34:52,881
Why are you getting frustrated?

1076
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:57,971
Of course, I'm frustrated.
They are cheating you.

1077
01:34:57,996 --> 01:35:00,545
Paparao is cheating you for money.

1078
01:35:00,852 --> 01:35:03,602
Sindhu is not the topper.
She's the dullest of dullers!

1079
01:35:03,627 --> 01:35:09,051
She even failed the college internals.
I beg you, we don't need her...

1080
01:35:13,521 --> 01:35:16,584
Did I ever ask you for any help?

1081
01:35:21,570 --> 01:35:25,328
You say that a couple should look
like made for each other, right?

1082
01:35:25,798 --> 01:35:28,439
-Of course!
-I felt the same with Sindhu.

1083
01:35:28,464 --> 01:35:31,236
That's why I lied to my mom
and getting married to her.

1084
01:35:31,409 --> 01:35:34,432
Please, dude.
You have to get us married, please!

1085
01:35:36,623 --> 01:35:38,574
-Ok. I will.
-Thanks, dude.

1086
01:36:13,895 --> 01:36:16,910
With all the pain in your heart,
how are you even smiling, bro?

1087
01:36:22,074 --> 01:36:25,769
Hey, they just crossed TFC.
Kalyan and Barath are there.

1088
01:36:25,794 --> 01:36:27,242
-Follow them.
-Let's go.

1089
01:36:44,146 --> 01:36:45,567
What happened?

1090
01:36:45,592 --> 01:36:48,384
Bike trouble. Going to get it repaired...

1091
01:36:48,882 --> 01:36:50,030
Brother...

1092
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:55,513
-They stopped the bike.
-We shouldn't miss this chance.

1093
01:36:55,538 --> 01:36:57,069
Barath got off the bike.

1094
01:36:57,094 --> 01:37:00,920
Son, your dad is waiting on the road.

1095
01:37:03,916 --> 01:37:05,565
Kalyan is going alone.

1096
01:37:05,590 --> 01:37:08,324
No matter what... Don't leave him.

1097
01:37:18,074 --> 01:37:19,528
Right right!

1098
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:33,462
Kiran, he stopped the bike at the club.
There's someone there.

1099
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:38,144
-Who's that?
-Seems aged. Maybe his dad.

1100
01:38:41,344 --> 01:38:42,766
What?

1101
01:38:43,489 --> 01:38:48,309
Until you earn money,
even your son won't respect you!

1102
01:38:52,540 --> 01:38:55,290
Your grandpa earned a lot.

1103
01:38:55,846 --> 01:38:58,479
That's why I never knew
the value of money.

1104
01:38:59,247 --> 01:39:01,794
I have spent it like water.

1105
01:39:03,162 --> 01:39:04,889
I gave out money for
everyone who asked.

1106
01:39:06,455 --> 01:39:09,713
But I failed to give you anything.

1107
01:39:10,999 --> 01:39:15,398
But today...
you know the value of money.

1108
01:39:16,696 --> 01:39:19,610
And you are earning well. But...

1109
01:39:20,229 --> 01:39:22,119
How can you stop talking with me?

1110
01:39:25,446 --> 01:39:27,875
How can you... God!

1111
01:39:29,785 --> 01:39:36,839
If your son turns out
to be just like me...

1112
01:39:38,034 --> 01:39:41,230
Will you leave him just like you left me?
How can that be?

1113
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:43,572
Damn this life!

1114
01:40:09,198 --> 01:40:10,480
Who's that?

1115
01:40:13,002 --> 01:40:15,853
I thought only me and my son fight...

1116
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:18,747
Even you guys fight!

1117
01:40:19,358 --> 01:40:20,952
College fights?

1118
01:40:21,233 --> 01:40:24,218
Did he poke a girl or something?

1119
01:40:24,816 --> 01:40:27,926
Of course, he might have.

1120
01:40:30,287 --> 01:40:33,537
Why do you need all
these people to thrash just one!

1121
01:40:36,724 --> 01:40:38,748
Since his childhood...

1122
01:40:39,154 --> 01:40:43,912
I... I have never seen him hit someone.

1123
01:40:45,664 --> 01:40:48,242
What? Can you handle them?

1124
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:53,429
Can you hit at least one of them?

1125
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:55,369
Go on.

1126
01:40:56,354 --> 01:40:57,737
Go!

1127
01:42:39,842 --> 01:42:42,178
This time we have to make
him run before thrashing him.

1128
01:42:49,672 --> 01:42:53,687
-What happened?
-Some college fight. Let's go.

1129
01:43:46,711 --> 01:43:50,172
Hey, even he had men
with him like us.

1130
01:43:50,728 --> 01:43:52,634
He thrashed all of them up.

1131
01:43:53,070 --> 01:43:55,398
I already got detained
twice because of him.

1132
01:43:55,423 --> 01:43:59,035
One more time and my dad will kill me.

1133
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:01,393
-Let's go.
-As if I enjoy this or something!

1134
01:44:12,146 --> 01:44:14,263
Who? Did my uncle send you?

1135
01:44:16,017 --> 01:44:19,720
You just asked us to warn him.
But he thrashed us.

1136
01:44:36,824 --> 01:44:38,074
Brother, tea.

1137
01:44:39,229 --> 01:44:41,643
-How many bookings came in, Satish?
-12, brother.

1138
01:44:41,668 --> 01:44:43,606
-Advances?
-Handed it to Barath brother.

1139
01:44:44,232 --> 01:44:46,732
-All good?
-I'm counting, bro.

1140
01:44:47,017 --> 01:44:48,314
Ok, you go.

1141
01:44:53,583 --> 01:44:55,661
Answer that call. I'm busy.

1142
01:44:55,911 --> 01:44:59,458
We have to pay for the tent
house and he's eating my brains.

1143
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:01,441
Sattu Sankeerth...

1144
01:45:01,466 --> 01:45:02,582
Answer it.

1145
01:45:04,687 --> 01:45:05,992
Dhinu...

1146
01:45:06,235 --> 01:45:09,274
Why are you not answering my calls?
Are you busy?

1147
01:45:10,154 --> 01:45:13,099
Don't you have any other better thing
to do than calling me all the time?

1148
01:45:13,124 --> 01:45:16,466
What happened, Dhinu? You are
behaving differently for the last 5 days!

1149
01:45:16,618 --> 01:45:19,040
That's when the problem started from.

1150
01:45:19,065 --> 01:45:20,603
What problem?

1151
01:45:20,910 --> 01:45:22,660
Tell me what you called for!

1152
01:45:22,685 --> 01:45:25,811
Nothing. I got a chance to
go see a movie with Sindhu.

1153
01:45:26,226 --> 01:45:29,765
-Can you book tickets.
-Don't you have Prime of Netflix?

1154
01:45:29,961 --> 01:45:33,148
-Tell me, I'll send you the credentials.
-Not like that, Dhinu.

1155
01:45:33,173 --> 01:45:36,605
Kushi got re-released.
I want to watch it with Sindhu.

1156
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:39,272
I asked her parents too. They said 'OK'.

1157
01:45:39,297 --> 01:45:42,143
Even Sindhu is interested. But...

1158
01:45:42,387 --> 01:45:44,301
Then you go. What can I do?

1159
01:45:44,326 --> 01:45:48,223
Sindhu's sister is also coming with us.

1160
01:45:48,377 --> 01:45:49,541
So I have to manage her!

1161
01:45:49,566 --> 01:45:53,440
Such a great friend you are.
You get me like that...

1162
01:45:53,709 --> 01:45:55,998
But you failed to understand my emotions!

1163
01:45:56,023 --> 01:45:58,577
How can you say that?
You know I love you.

1164
01:45:58,602 --> 01:46:00,038
Do you want to come along?

1165
01:46:00,063 --> 01:46:01,723
-Tell him.
-I'll come.

1166
01:46:01,748 --> 01:46:02,973
-Hello!
-Tell him.

1167
01:46:02,998 --> 01:46:05,105
Tell him. I'll come.
I don't know what you'll do.

1168
01:46:05,258 --> 01:46:08,601
-Tell him.
-Hey... This fool!

1169
01:46:08,847 --> 01:46:09,945
What shall I say?

1170
01:46:09,970 --> 01:46:12,471
-Who else is coming? Who's he?
-Why do you care? Book the tickets.

1171
01:46:12,734 --> 01:46:15,718
Ok. Matinee show,
Prasad theater, 02:30 PM.

1172
01:46:15,813 --> 01:46:16,874
Be there.

1173
01:46:17,429 --> 01:46:20,710
The theater doesn't
matter to spoil a life!

1174
01:46:20,735 --> 01:46:23,330
Maybe you got mad with
the wedding stress!

1175
01:46:23,613 --> 01:46:25,121
Cool, man! Chill!

1176
01:47:46,635 --> 01:47:49,088
Sindhu, listen to me.

1177
01:47:49,228 --> 01:47:52,520
I can't tell him my problem.
At least you understand.

1178
01:47:52,796 --> 01:47:55,216
How can you romance him?
You are engaged.

1179
01:47:55,415 --> 01:47:58,618
Lovers will have some amount
of romance going on, right?

1180
01:48:03,434 --> 01:48:04,777
What do you say, Kalyan?

1181
01:49:21,741 --> 01:49:23,124
Milk!

1182
01:49:23,827 --> 01:49:25,280
What's with her sister, brother?

1183
01:49:25,897 --> 01:49:27,475
Milk!

1184
01:49:27,585 --> 01:49:29,155
Here comes her mother!

1185
01:49:31,414 --> 01:49:32,539
Milk!

1186
01:51:46,309 --> 01:51:50,323
I feel so happy.
It lost its charm 20 years back.

1187
01:51:50,348 --> 01:51:54,262
Now it's shining again.
All your problems will go away now.

1188
01:51:55,601 --> 01:52:00,523
How can we think our problems
will go away, just with this?

1189
01:52:00,548 --> 01:52:03,213
Is it about Kalyan not talking with you?

1190
01:52:03,238 --> 01:52:04,588
Don't know, brother.

1191
01:52:05,736 --> 01:52:10,017
Don't know what I did.
My own son won't talk to me.

1192
01:52:10,536 --> 01:52:15,911
No matter how much his son
earns, all this is temporary.

1193
01:52:19,788 --> 01:52:21,453
One has to have common sense.

1194
01:52:21,611 --> 01:52:25,900
He blew his father's money. Now he'll
blow his son's money. How will that work?

1195
01:52:28,633 --> 01:52:33,664
Just like the rain on a wild buffalo...
He will never change.

1196
01:52:34,710 --> 01:52:37,499
Worst son for great father.

1197
01:52:40,177 --> 01:52:42,669
Rather than being a father like him...

1198
01:52:42,694 --> 01:52:45,919
-It's better he die.
-Right!

1199
01:52:47,377 --> 01:52:49,861
Hey, Kalyan...

1200
01:52:51,297 --> 01:52:54,742
-Leave me!
-Hey, stop.

1201
01:52:55,125 --> 01:52:58,868
-Dhinu...
-Kalyan!

1202
01:52:59,115 --> 01:53:00,263
What!

1203
01:53:00,318 --> 01:53:04,427
Lakhs of condonation will give
you education, not morals.

1204
01:53:04,976 --> 01:53:06,390
Teach him some.

1205
01:53:06,537 --> 01:53:07,701
Damn!

1206
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:40,128
What's... What's with the fight?

1207
01:53:40,451 --> 01:53:44,420
Nothing. You know your brother-in-law
is a loose tongue, right?

1208
01:53:44,889 --> 01:53:46,053
Kalyan got angry and hit him.

1209
01:53:46,078 --> 01:53:48,161
Will he hit everyone he gets angry on?

1210
01:53:49,435 --> 01:53:52,083
Haven't he had any manners!

1211
01:53:54,721 --> 01:54:00,211
With just some money coming into
his pockets, look at his ego.

1212
01:54:03,315 --> 01:54:06,580
Or does he feel that he earned
back the name that I have lost?

1213
01:54:06,605 --> 01:54:07,943
Nothing like that...

1214
01:54:09,204 --> 01:54:12,884
Money is nothing, it comes and goes.

1215
01:54:15,347 --> 01:54:17,307
The way we live is important, right?

1216
01:54:22,870 --> 01:54:24,394
No matter how much I have lost...

1217
01:54:26,465 --> 01:54:27,825
I ate no one's money.

1218
01:54:30,771 --> 01:54:32,786
How can I tell him that?

1219
01:54:33,189 --> 01:54:35,189
Listen to me...

1220
01:54:42,252 --> 01:54:46,979
Of course, her mom will ask for whatever
she wants. It's me who'll suffer, right?

1221
01:54:54,359 --> 01:54:57,687
Sindhu, a little...

1222
01:55:03,542 --> 01:55:07,432
It doesn't seem like pre-wedding
shoot, but his personal photoshoot!

1223
01:55:11,727 --> 01:55:14,071
I'm interested in the
wedding, not photoshoots.

1224
01:55:14,096 --> 01:55:16,954
I understand how badly
you want the wedding.

1225
01:55:17,487 --> 01:55:20,066
Are all your friends this bad?

1226
01:55:20,185 --> 01:55:21,857
He's the top among all, brother.

1227
01:55:26,066 --> 01:55:28,287
-What happened, bro?
-The battery overheated, bro.

1228
01:55:28,312 --> 01:55:29,670
I'll go cool it down.

1229
01:55:32,746 --> 01:55:35,386
-Hey, look here.
-Shut up and click.

1230
01:55:36,017 --> 01:55:39,408
The pre-wedding shoot is also being done.
Only the wedding is remaining now.

1231
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,762
At least cry a little now.

1232
01:55:42,084 --> 01:55:45,263
If that helps,
I would have made you cry along with me.

1233
01:55:45,558 --> 01:55:47,512
It won't, right? Look.

1234
01:55:48,425 --> 01:55:49,855
Another still? Go on.

1235
01:55:57,492 --> 01:55:58,499
Thanks!

1236
01:56:00,841 --> 01:56:03,231
-Have it.
-I'm not hungry. Move!

1237
01:56:05,772 --> 01:56:09,007
Give it. I ate in the morning.
Too hungry!

1238
01:56:16,332 --> 01:56:17,629
Have this piece, Sindhu.

1239
01:56:20,670 --> 01:56:24,178
-The climate is cool, right?
-But I'm burning up!

1240
01:56:25,071 --> 01:56:26,905
Why is Kalyan behaving oddly?

1241
01:56:26,930 --> 01:56:28,406
If I answer that, you'll die.

1242
01:56:28,572 --> 01:56:29,673
True story!

1243
01:56:31,452 --> 01:56:34,795
-On this peaceful evening.
-Only evening. Not peaceful

1244
01:56:35,047 --> 01:56:37,000
I want to tell you guys something.

1245
01:56:37,646 --> 01:56:40,857
This is not just an arranged marriage.
It's a love marriage.

1246
01:56:41,683 --> 01:56:42,941
What the twist!

1247
01:56:44,198 --> 01:56:47,565
I said no, but they somehow
sent Sindhu's photo to me.

1248
01:56:48,490 --> 01:56:50,138
And I fell for her instantly.

1249
01:57:13,868 --> 01:57:15,134
I love you, Sindhu.

1250
01:57:24,716 --> 01:57:26,825
Poor guy seems serious.

1251
01:57:26,850 --> 01:57:28,825
Of course, my love is just comedy.

1252
01:57:29,061 --> 01:57:32,889
He expressed and I didn't.
I'm burning up. Whom should I talk to?

1253
01:57:32,987 --> 01:57:35,276
Damn it! No one understands my pain.

1254
01:57:37,092 --> 01:57:39,358
What happened, Sindhu?
Did I say anything wrong?

1255
01:57:39,383 --> 01:57:40,553
No.

1256
01:57:41,041 --> 01:57:42,432
I did a mistake.

1257
01:57:42,928 --> 01:57:46,467
I thought you are in this
because of your family, but...

1258
01:57:46,492 --> 01:57:48,736
I don't know that you are this serious.

1259
01:57:50,262 --> 01:57:51,707
I don't want this marriage.

1260
01:57:52,587 --> 01:57:55,829
My dad never gave me the freedom
to express such things to him.

1261
01:58:21,705 --> 01:58:25,181
-You know all about this, right?
-I was just about to tell you...

1262
01:58:25,709 --> 01:58:27,053
But I never listened!

1263
01:58:45,805 --> 01:58:47,125
Why did you do this?

1264
01:58:48,767 --> 01:58:51,571
-I'm talking to you.
-I like Kalyan, dad.

1265
01:58:52,366 --> 01:58:56,522
I couldn't even take in the fact that you
are getting married in his wedding hall!

1266
01:58:57,186 --> 01:59:00,608
How do you think that I
will let you marry him?

1267
01:59:02,706 --> 01:59:06,042
You want a rich man
to be your son-in-law.

1268
01:59:06,376 --> 01:59:09,362
But all that I want is a caring husband.

1269
01:59:09,387 --> 01:59:11,286
How dare you talk back to me!

1270
01:59:11,763 --> 01:59:15,068
-You cheated me.
-Not as much as you cheat others, dad.

1271
01:59:16,459 --> 01:59:19,849
You cheat them in the name of loans.
You send goons onto them.

1272
01:59:20,476 --> 01:59:22,461
Do you think I don't know all that?

1273
01:59:23,741 --> 01:59:26,436
No daughter can say that her
father is a bad man, dad.

1274
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:29,064
-Same with me.
-What's happening here!

1275
01:59:29,756 --> 01:59:31,748
I took good care of them, right?

1276
01:59:31,773 --> 01:59:33,030
You did, dad.

1277
01:59:33,110 --> 01:59:36,188
As much that even your daughter
can't express her pain to you.

1278
01:59:36,213 --> 01:59:40,528
I'm telling you now.
I love Kalyan and I'll marry only him.

1279
01:59:52,249 --> 01:59:54,171
How do you think that I'll let you do it?

1280
01:59:54,433 --> 01:59:56,433
Do I look that useless?

1281
01:59:56,458 --> 02:00:01,700
It's not you. It's him...
I did the mistake of not killing him that day.

1282
02:00:02,468 --> 02:00:03,539
Move!

1283
02:00:05,917 --> 02:00:07,260
Get in.

1284
02:00:07,677 --> 02:00:08,935
No...

1285
02:00:09,383 --> 02:00:12,219
-Do you love someone too?
-No, dad.

1286
02:00:12,244 --> 02:00:13,376
Get inside!

1287
02:00:15,332 --> 02:00:16,980
So Sindhu is yours now, right?

1288
02:00:17,172 --> 02:00:19,844
Barath brother, Kalyan got Sindhu now.

1289
02:00:19,869 --> 02:00:23,019
-You go get that short girl.
-Yeah.

1290
02:00:23,473 --> 02:00:26,789
-She's your best bet.
-I know that.

1291
02:00:26,825 --> 02:00:28,559
Maybe she too won't marry him.

1292
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:33,121
-Of course, she might not.
-But I'll marry her.

1293
02:00:41,269 --> 02:00:43,347
I would have killed you that day...

1294
02:00:44,765 --> 02:00:48,180
Earn a living arranging
weddings in the hall.

1295
02:00:48,205 --> 02:00:50,242
But how dare you trap the bride herself!

1296
02:00:52,075 --> 02:00:54,981
How dare you think you
can get my daughter!

1297
02:00:58,663 --> 02:01:01,241
I thought your father
is the bigger idiot.

1298
02:01:02,325 --> 02:01:04,060
He brought you up the same way.

1299
02:01:07,837 --> 02:01:13,345
One more word about my
wedding hall or my dad...

1300
02:01:13,543 --> 02:01:14,871
Don't you dare!

1301
02:01:16,114 --> 02:01:20,434
From now on... Forget about your daughter,
I won't even come near your house.

1302
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:22,184
[all]: What are you talking?

1303
02:01:23,900 --> 02:01:24,955
Please leave.

1304
02:01:25,612 --> 02:01:28,487
If anything else goes wrong
regarding my daughter...

1305
02:01:29,329 --> 02:01:31,532
I'll kill you all, you idiots!

1306
02:01:34,630 --> 02:01:35,935
Let's go.

1307
02:01:37,395 --> 02:01:38,661
What are you doing, bro?

1308
02:01:40,106 --> 02:01:41,895
Do you even understand?

1309
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:46,686
You love Sindhu, right?
Can you live without her now?

1310
02:01:47,094 --> 02:01:49,711
What did he even say for
you to let go of Sindhu?

1311
02:01:50,691 --> 02:01:55,074
Kalyan, tell us at least now.
What's the pain that's inside your heart?

1312
02:02:46,964 --> 02:02:48,152
Kalyan...

1313
02:02:49,099 --> 02:02:50,639
You told me remember?

1314
02:02:51,170 --> 02:02:53,147
Forget about others thinking...

1315
02:02:53,693 --> 02:02:56,318
First, you think of me as your lover.

1316
02:02:57,476 --> 02:02:58,539
I'm telling you now...

1317
02:03:00,485 --> 02:03:01,610
I love you, Kalyan.

1318
02:03:03,076 --> 02:03:04,256
I need you.

1319
02:03:05,789 --> 02:03:07,117
Do something.

1320
02:03:20,301 --> 02:03:22,520
[Dharma singing a sad song]

1321
02:03:39,283 --> 02:03:40,494
Listen...

1322
02:03:41,745 --> 02:03:43,292
Hey!

1323
02:03:44,157 --> 02:03:46,095
What happened?

1324
02:03:46,344 --> 02:03:47,547
Nothing.

1325
02:03:48,186 --> 02:03:51,397
I can see... Tell me what happened?

1326
02:03:52,950 --> 02:03:55,130
It's about Kalyan...

1327
02:03:55,216 --> 02:03:56,497
Hey!

1328
02:03:57,865 --> 02:03:59,849
Do we need to talk about him now?

1329
02:04:01,471 --> 02:04:05,252
It's been raining after a long time.

1330
02:04:06,482 --> 02:04:08,732
Let's drink in peace.

1331
02:04:09,844 --> 02:04:11,805
Kalyan is not like you think he is.

1332
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:14,581
What? Huh?

1333
02:04:15,939 --> 02:04:17,923
Do you think I misunderstand him?

1334
02:04:19,582 --> 02:04:24,004
You know how much pain
I take because of him.

1335
02:04:24,483 --> 02:04:26,718
He's taking even greater pain than you.

1336
02:04:37,329 --> 02:04:41,059
What happened? Huh?

1337
02:04:49,355 --> 02:04:51,504
Is this where my dad drinks every day?

1338
02:04:54,709 --> 02:04:56,131
Fix me a peg.

1339
02:04:57,738 --> 02:04:58,816
It's ok.

1340
02:05:03,755 --> 02:05:06,294
How many years have
you been with my dad?

1341
02:05:06,874 --> 02:05:10,327
Approximately... 10 years.

1342
02:05:12,289 --> 02:05:14,523
So right after I stopped
talking with him.

1343
02:05:16,859 --> 02:05:18,640
People ask me all the time...

1344
02:05:19,126 --> 02:05:22,751
Why don't I talk to my dad?
Even my mom does.

1345
02:05:24,037 --> 02:05:25,608
But I never felt like answering them.

1346
02:05:27,276 --> 02:05:28,604
But today, you...

1347
02:05:29,923 --> 02:05:32,438
You asked me the same question, and...

1348
02:05:33,244 --> 02:05:34,674
I felt like telling you.

1349
02:05:37,894 --> 02:05:40,426
Everyone will be with us
when we have everything.

1350
02:05:42,108 --> 02:05:47,421
But you know he has nothing with him and
you are taking care of him for 10 years.

1351
02:05:56,325 --> 02:05:59,052
Do you know how I used to be
with my dad before 10 years?

1352
02:05:59,764 --> 02:06:03,381
Damn it...
I used be roam around him all day.

1353
02:06:03,815 --> 02:06:08,447
He had to feed me, put me to
sleep, and even style my hair.

1354
02:06:08,637 --> 02:06:11,801
Even he had to dress me up.
No one else.

1355
02:06:12,038 --> 02:06:15,350
That's how mad I am about my father!

1356
02:06:17,902 --> 02:06:22,714
When I was a kid, I once asked him
2k to buy Diwali crackers...

1357
02:06:22,917 --> 02:06:24,378
He used to give me 4k.

1358
02:06:24,487 --> 02:06:25,894
If I ask why...

1359
02:06:25,919 --> 02:06:28,618
He used to ask me to buy
crackers for my friends too.

1360
02:06:28,924 --> 02:06:33,791
They used to light up the
crackers and praise my dad...

1361
02:06:33,816 --> 02:06:36,229
Such a great feeling it was!

1362
02:06:38,531 --> 02:06:42,156
My dad laughing with his
men, twirling his mustache...

1363
02:06:43,332 --> 02:06:45,684
Such a spectacle it used to be.

1364
02:06:47,887 --> 02:06:50,106
I still remember...

1365
02:06:50,446 --> 02:06:53,478
He once took me to join
me in the school...

1366
02:06:53,503 --> 02:06:56,032
He lit a smoke in the front seat...

1367
02:06:56,173 --> 02:07:00,360
Do you know how it felt,
looking at him from the back seat? God!

1368
02:07:01,323 --> 02:07:04,737
I still get goosebumps,
remembering that.

1369
02:07:05,721 --> 02:07:07,135
That's how I saw him.

1370
02:07:10,911 --> 02:07:12,380
Don't know what happened.

1371
02:07:14,801 --> 02:07:16,152
My grandpa died...

1372
02:07:17,404 --> 02:07:19,154
And things started to change.

1373
02:07:20,899 --> 02:07:22,789
My dad stopped smiling.

1374
02:07:24,254 --> 02:07:28,785
People started blaming him.
Forget about others...

1375
02:07:28,981 --> 02:07:31,372
Relatives and close ones...

1376
02:07:32,386 --> 02:07:36,347
I never understood why
they blamed my dad.

1377
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:42,524
I'm not old enough to
ask him what he did.

1378
02:07:46,167 --> 02:07:49,151
Fights and screams at home, 24/7.

1379
02:07:50,702 --> 02:07:54,397
Like everyone else, I too stopped talking
to him, thinking he did something.

1380
02:07:58,941 --> 02:08:01,496
I understood only after few years...

1381
02:08:02,683 --> 02:08:04,699
What wrong did my dad do?

1382
02:08:06,184 --> 02:08:08,418
That's how my grandpa brought him up.

1383
02:08:09,833 --> 02:08:13,559
He took care of the
wedding hall 24/7, but...

1384
02:08:14,122 --> 02:08:16,786
He left my dad with the servants.

1385
02:08:17,233 --> 02:08:19,335
How will one grow up
with the servants?

1386
02:08:19,739 --> 02:08:23,020
He will know how to
spend, but not to save.

1387
02:08:27,286 --> 02:08:28,848
After understanding all this...

1388
02:08:30,392 --> 02:08:32,720
I tried a lot to talk to him.

1389
02:08:33,421 --> 02:08:35,288
I felt so shameful.

1390
02:08:36,533 --> 02:08:38,494
Even I misunderstood him.

1391
02:08:40,413 --> 02:08:42,796
Every time I tried to talk to him...

1392
02:08:43,856 --> 02:08:46,738
Maybe because of my mad love for him...

1393
02:08:48,901 --> 02:08:51,136
Or the respect...

1394
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:54,825
I never got brave enough to talk.

1395
02:08:58,515 --> 02:09:00,265
My dad is a really good man.

1396
02:09:02,033 --> 02:09:07,681
He helped others but he never
took help or money from anyone.

1397
02:09:13,194 --> 02:09:15,983
That's when I have decided...

1398
02:09:16,196 --> 02:09:20,149
I wanted to see my dad the
same way I once saw him.

1399
02:09:20,790 --> 02:09:24,806
Their legs have to shiver
to look directly at my dad.

1400
02:09:25,085 --> 02:09:27,366
Their perspective
towards him should change.

1401
02:09:27,953 --> 02:09:31,445
That's why I have decided to
go to the US and earn money there.

1402
02:09:32,043 --> 02:09:33,301
But...

1403
02:09:34,196 --> 02:09:35,563
I got to know that...

1404
02:09:35,890 --> 02:09:40,336
My dad's respect is linked
to this wedding hall.

1405
02:09:42,288 --> 02:09:45,452
That's why I'm doing all this.

1406
02:09:49,774 --> 02:09:51,087
By the grace of God...

1407
02:09:52,428 --> 02:09:53,889
And with my grandpa's blessings...

1408
02:09:56,348 --> 02:09:58,004
Everything is going good.

1409
02:09:59,341 --> 02:10:01,505
The way I wanted to see my dad...

1410
02:10:03,071 --> 02:10:04,727
I will see him so, soon.

1411
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:10,019
Like you all think...

1412
02:10:11,167 --> 02:10:17,268
I'm not taking care of this wedding
hall for my grandpa or my mom.

1413
02:10:28,613 --> 02:10:30,121
It's for my dad!

1414
02:10:31,695 --> 02:10:32,961
He has to live great!

1415
02:10:35,449 --> 02:10:37,628
No one should blame him.

1416
02:13:23,309 --> 02:13:25,973
The one who gave birth to
me never understood me.

1417
02:13:28,337 --> 02:13:30,736
The one who married me,
never understood me either.

1418
02:13:32,906 --> 02:13:35,757
But the one I gave birth to...

1419
02:13:38,049 --> 02:13:39,487
My Kalyan...

1420
02:13:42,587 --> 02:13:44,008
He understood me.

1421
02:13:54,564 --> 02:13:56,064
Where is he?

1422
02:14:06,539 --> 02:14:11,000
I told you, right? Touch the son
and the father will come out.

1423
02:14:48,126 --> 02:14:50,024
Bloody!

1424
02:14:51,328 --> 02:14:55,124
Do you have the guts to
look directly into my eyes?

1425
02:14:55,622 --> 02:14:57,872
Look at yourself!

1426
02:14:59,208 --> 02:15:01,122
After my dad died...

1427
02:15:02,231 --> 02:15:05,731
Do you think I don't know that
you looted our properties?

1428
02:15:06,684 --> 02:15:10,434
I left you so, thinking that you
are just a dog that feeds on filth.

1429
02:15:10,504 --> 02:15:12,051
That's how I am!

1430
02:15:14,761 --> 02:15:17,261
What did you say? Huh!

1431
02:15:18,845 --> 02:15:21,806
My son is an useless fellow like me.

1432
02:15:22,017 --> 02:15:23,775
He's not useless.

1433
02:15:24,469 --> 02:15:27,758
With idiots like you
blaming me all day...

1434
02:15:31,748 --> 02:15:33,201
He failed to take it.

1435
02:15:36,451 --> 02:15:38,194
He failed to talk to me.

1436
02:15:40,852 --> 02:15:42,141
He suffered...

1437
02:15:44,070 --> 02:15:45,898
Every single day!

1438
02:15:51,827 --> 02:15:56,632
All these days I felt bad
that he won't talk to me.

1439
02:15:58,364 --> 02:15:59,802
And I remained a cat.

1440
02:16:03,164 --> 02:16:07,273
If all that he wants is
to see me be a tiger...

1441
02:16:08,627 --> 02:16:10,854
Why do I even stay the same?

1442
02:16:12,920 --> 02:16:16,787
I would have killed you if I get to
know that you have sent men onto him.

1443
02:16:21,187 --> 02:16:22,655
Right then...

1444
02:16:31,970 --> 02:16:36,454
I came to know that he
likes your daughter.

1445
02:16:37,054 --> 02:16:38,640
Even she likes him back.

1446
02:16:39,132 --> 02:16:41,366
The very spot you hit him at...

1447
02:16:42,971 --> 02:16:46,135
You have to handover your daughter
to him right at that place tomorrow.

1448
02:16:47,235 --> 02:16:48,672
Or else...

1449
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:53,493
I'll be back by the same time tomorrow.

1450
02:17:03,478 --> 02:17:09,033
I never even touched my son's cheek...

1451
02:17:11,931 --> 02:17:14,056
But you...

1452
02:17:49,715 --> 02:17:53,293
-OK?
-Little higher. Higher...

1453
02:17:55,302 --> 02:17:56,482
Now?

1454
02:17:58,620 --> 02:17:59,674
Son...

1455
02:18:04,962 --> 02:18:07,516
I only came to know last night.

1456
02:18:08,288 --> 02:18:11,116
Even my daughter loves you, a lot.

1457
02:20:44,777 --> 02:20:46,909
No matter if he earn or not...

1458
02:20:46,934 --> 02:20:48,667
No matter if he save money or not...

1459
02:20:48,919 --> 02:20:50,419
My dad is always my king.
