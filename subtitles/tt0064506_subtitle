1
00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:13,362
No!

2
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,461
Mr. Rai, you have
murdered your wife.

3
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,796
It's a lie.
I have not killed her!

4
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:59,464
I don't know anything
about it. I'm innocent.

5
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:02,270
Inspector Saheb, he is lying.
He has killed my sister.

6
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:06,142
Renu, what are you saying?
You know I love her.

7
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:08,545
Mr. Rai, please be quiet.
I want to record her statement.

8
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:10,618
But you're misinterpreting
her statement.

9
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:12,946
Yes, Miss Renu?

10
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:18,191
He married my sister
last year.

11
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:22,160
My brother-in-law is a very
famous painter.

12
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:27,534
From the very beginning, they
quarrelled with each other.

13
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:32,206
My sister liked to
go to parties...

14
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:35,970
but he was always busy
with his paintings

15
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:38,974
and often refused
to go with her.

16
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:47,120
Just before the
murder tonight...

17
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,721
A few minutes before that...

18
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,003
Sushma, your husband is
still not ready.

19
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:10,342
Aren't you ready yet?

20
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:13,411
Didn't you hear
what I'm saying?

21
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,750
Did you say something?
- When will you be ready?

22
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,381
We have got to go to a party.
- Party! What party?

23
00:09:23,993 --> 00:09:27,121
Have you forgotten that Mr. Sinha
had invited us for dinner today?

24
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:31,096
Today is our wedding anniversary.
- Oh yes, I remembered.

25
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:33,326
You go ahead and I'll
follow you shortly.

26
00:09:33,836 --> 00:09:37,328
No, I'll not go alone.
The party is for both of us.

27
00:09:37,507 --> 00:09:40,101
For celebrating our wedding
anniversary. Get ready soon.

28
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,641
It's not possible for me now.
I've got to finish this painting.

29
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:48,306
It's always your painting.
I'm sick of it.

30
00:09:48,484 --> 00:09:51,112
It was a cursed moment
when I married you.

31
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:54,688
I feel humiliated in front
of my friends because of you.

32
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:57,291
I'll see how you will paint tonight.
- Don't be childish.

33
00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:59,688
Give me the brush.
I've to finish the painting.

34
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:00,794
No.

35
00:10:00,963 --> 00:10:02,863
Sushma, you don't understand.
This painting is my life...

36
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:06,296
it's my dream and
means a lot to me.

37
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:10,802
Tomorrow, when it's exhibited
in the International Exhibition...

38
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:12,440
you'll feel proud of me.

39
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:14,837
To hell with your ambitions
and exhibition.

40
00:10:14,977 --> 00:10:17,775
You will not paint tonight.
- What's the matter with you?

41
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:21,383
I have to complete it and will
not leave the room till then.

42
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:24,782
I can be as obstinate as you are.
I'll see how it'll be completed

43
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:28,617
Keep your hands off it. If you goad me
into rage you'll regret it.

44
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,888
Let me work, go away!

45
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:33,789
What do you think of me?
Is it more valuable than me?

46
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:36,363
Yes, a thousand times!
- Is that so?

47
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:38,591
You'll have to choose me
or this painting.

48
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:44,935
You have shattered my dreams.
- No.

49
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,635
You've tried to kill my soul.
I'll not leave you alive.

50
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,334
I'll kill you!

51
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:10,795
When I entered the room,
I saw horror which scared me.

52
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:13,263
A scene which I didn't expect.

53
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,195
There were no words
to explain it.

54
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:20,534
I stood near her and
tried to call out.

55
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:23,944
But she didn't reply.

56
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:27,940
Her eyes had lost their luster

57
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:30,712
Her sweet voice
could never be heard.

58
00:11:32,054 --> 00:11:35,649
My sister was not there.
Before me was only a corpse...

59
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:38,589
No, Inspector, it's a lie.
I've not killed my wife.

60
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:40,888
He has murdered my sister.

61
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:44,328
I've not killed but if
you persist, I'll kill you.

62
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:59,179
Your Honour, this man who
is presented before you...

63
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:03,374
is a killer... a criminal.
He has killed his wife.

64
00:12:03,953 --> 00:12:07,719
Each bit of evidence, every statement
is a proof to the fact.

65
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,790
That he is a murderer.

66
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,790
Yes...
I'm a killer.

67
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:15,328
I've killed my wife!

68
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:40,651
Judge Saheb,
I've not killed my wife.

69
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,423
If anything happens to me,
I will kill you too...

70
00:12:47,663 --> 00:12:51,224
I will kill everyone.

71
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:59,235
This man is not in his senses

72
00:12:59,408 --> 00:13:02,502
He'll be sent to a mental
hospital where he can be examined.

73
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:05,704
The reports of the doctor will
be produced before this court.

74
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:02,302
Come in, you're welcome.
Please be seated.

75
00:14:03,806 --> 00:14:07,401
What brings you here?
- In connection with Dilip Rai.

76
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:09,438
The Court would like to
know how he is?

77
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:13,076
So you're here to know the welfare
of your accused and our patient.

78
00:14:13,282 --> 00:14:14,510
Precisely.

79
00:14:15,284 --> 00:14:20,312
The case has begun and his
mental condition changed.

80
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:24,257
What do you think, doctor?

81
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:30,131
Is Mr. Rai really mad or is he
feigning to escape the noose.

82
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:33,335
We were discussing this very
thing, just before you came.

83
00:14:34,236 --> 00:14:36,500
Excuse me,
I forgot to introduce you.

84
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:38,501
He's inspector...
- Dewan

85
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:43,436
Rai is under his care.
Meet Police Prosecutor Mr. Khanna.

86
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:54,680
You see a lot of Rai.
What do you think of him?

87
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,622
I haven't formed an
opinion as yet.

88
00:14:59,195 --> 00:15:02,926
I have never come across
a more dangerous mental case.

89
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,362
It seems he's not mad,
but I am.

90
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:11,435
He talks good sense that's
baffling.

91
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:19,046
It's nothing new. Every mad man talks
good sense at times.

92
00:15:19,348 --> 00:15:23,114
Is Dilip Rai really
out of his mind?

93
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:30,121
Nothing can be said for sure...
but chances are that he is insane.

94
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,192
Deliberate murder of his wife...

95
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,930
his shrieking and excitement
before and after murder...

96
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,095
All this could only mean...
- that he is mad.

97
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:45,331
Can I meet Dilip Rai?
- Why not?

98
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:55,675
Please send No. 27 here at once.

99
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:04,716
How does Dilip Rai occupy himself?
- A reading fit is on these days.

100
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:06,886
He reads books on law.

101
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:09,094
Perhaps he wants to fight out
his own case.

102
00:16:09,698 --> 00:16:12,633
Let us hope he doesn't wish to
take your place.

103
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:16,831
Do you suggest, that I was mad
before I took to law.

104
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,106
Quite possible.

105
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:32,243
Come in, Rai.

106
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:38,554
The public prosecutor has
come to meet you.

107
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:14,487
It's fine day today,
isn't it?

108
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:20,629
Looks like it's going to rain.
What do you think Rai?

109
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:26,233
Do you like rain, Mr. Rai?

110
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:35,011
I hear you read a lot these days.

111
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:38,318
Very fond of law books, eh!

112
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:45,051
Let us drop this mouse and cat
game. Come to the point.

113
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:50,265
Police prosecutor is here to
inquire after you.

114
00:17:56,739 --> 00:18:00,539
He's not here to inquire
about my well being...

115
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:03,610
but to find out how soon
could I be hanged.

116
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:11,281
Why do you talk like this?
We're your friends.

117
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,581
I've no friends. If it is
proved that I'm not insane...

118
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:17,749
I'll be hanged.

119
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:21,563
And if it's proved that I'm
mad then I shall rot here...

120
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,632
for the rest of my life.
Both of you are my enemies.

121
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:29,503
Both of you are playing
with my life.

122
00:18:29,672 --> 00:18:31,765
The masters of law have
shown their skill...

123
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,170
held me as a killer and got
ready to hang me.

124
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:37,437
Then the psychiatrists showed
their skill and said...

125
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:40,241
I was out of my mind and
locked me in an asylum.

126
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,577
Well, anyway I'm doomed.

127
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:46,812
Rai, you indulge in fancies
that are baseless.

128
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:49,650
Please go and relax you
aren't feeling well.

129
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:54,260
Yes, I'm not well, I'm ailing...
but how can I be well?

130
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,160
Sometimes I'm held mad then as
a killer, again as killer or mad.

131
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:01,326
For God's sake I beg
of you to release me...

132
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,165
or I'll ram through the walls
of the lunatic asylum.

133
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:08,772
Let me go,
or I'll kill somebody.

134
00:19:18,654 --> 00:19:23,614
I'm convinced doctor that
he killed his wife.

135
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:27,353
Must have done it but only in
a fit of madness.

136
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:33,894
Under its spell, he forgets everything.
In anger he can kill anybody.

137
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:36,435
Just now he could have
killed you or me.

138
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:49,974
Doctor, Rai has escaped.

139
00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:51,880
I feared this. Come on.

140
00:21:00,622 --> 00:21:02,920
Rai ran away.
He also took my pistol.

141
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:06,393
Very dangerous man.
Inform everybody.

142
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:08,860
Police, wireless, Radio...
go and warn them on telephone.

143
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:36,812
Khan, what's the matter?
- I've been looking for you.

144
00:22:37,252 --> 00:22:39,447
I was told at your house
that you'd gone to movies.

145
00:22:39,621 --> 00:22:42,556
Then I was told that you were here.
- Why, what's the trouble?

146
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:44,954
Dilip Rai has escaped.
- Run away? Has he?

147
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:21,518
Who's there?

148
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:29,428
Excuse us for bothering you.
Did Dilip Rai come here?

149
00:23:29,771 --> 00:23:32,535
Dilip Rai?
- Yes. He escaped from the asylum.

150
00:23:33,842 --> 00:23:37,175
Escaped? No, no he
hasn't come here.

151
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:39,438
I think he'll come here first.

152
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:42,875
Will he come here?
- Don't be scared.

153
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:44,882
Two policemen have been
posted outside.

154
00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:08,437
This is Bombay Station of
All India Radio.

155
00:24:09,911 --> 00:24:11,902
Here's an important
announcement.

156
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:16,582
A mad man has escaped
from the lunatic asylum.

157
00:24:16,952 --> 00:24:21,582
He's a dangerous man
and has murdered his wife.

158
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,650
You're warned to keep your
doors and windows closed.

159
00:24:28,563 --> 00:24:35,731
He's 5'10", has a wheatish
complexion, and a sharp nose.

160
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:38,536
Overgrown hair on
head and beard.

161
00:24:38,974 --> 00:24:42,137
He's wearing a white
Khadi Kurta and Pajama.

162
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:47,242
The Kurta bears badge
No.27 of the lunatic asylum.

163
00:24:51,853 --> 00:24:56,085
Please inform the police,
telephone number 100,

164
00:25:02,597 --> 00:25:04,497
If you try to scream,
I'll shoot you.

165
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:10,098
You heard on the wireless about
me listen to me carefully...

166
00:25:10,272 --> 00:25:15,642
When I take off my hand,
don't shout, don't yell...

167
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:18,746
If you shriek, I'll shoot you.
Get the keys.

168
00:25:18,947 --> 00:25:19,971
The keys!

169
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:26,281
Listen. If you behave,
I won't harm you.

170
00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:32,624
If you shout,
you're dead. Get it.

171
00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:35,661
What do you want?
- Don't yell; speak softly.

172
00:25:37,432 --> 00:25:39,263
Who else is in
the house tell me?

173
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:40,662
Nobody.

174
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:50,343
Whose photograph is this?
- My husband's.

175
00:25:50,545 --> 00:25:52,445
His name?
- Jagmohan.

176
00:25:52,614 --> 00:25:54,707
Call him.
- I told you, nobody is in.

177
00:25:54,883 --> 00:25:55,907
I said shout.

178
00:25:56,785 --> 00:25:57,752
Louder.

179
00:25:58,186 --> 00:25:59,153
Scream!

180
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:01,513
Deaf, isn't he?
- I told you.

181
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,657
Quiet!

182
00:26:04,926 --> 00:26:06,621
Which room is this?
- Kitchen.

183
00:26:06,795 --> 00:26:07,762
Open it.

184
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:15,698
There's nobody in. Is there?
- No.

185
00:26:23,078 --> 00:26:27,310
Isn't such a pretty lady
afraid of being alone?

186
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:31,052
I'm scared of you...

187
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:34,889
Wait.

188
00:26:37,926 --> 00:26:40,360
You'll wet the sofa.

189
00:26:43,832 --> 00:26:46,164
Jagmohan's clothes must be there.
- Yes.

190
00:26:47,102 --> 00:26:50,196
I can't wear these wet
clothes of the asylum.

191
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:52,067
Where's his room?

192
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:54,868
Please stay here,
I'll fetch the clothes.

193
00:26:58,046 --> 00:26:59,070
Hold it!

194
00:26:59,981 --> 00:27:01,949
I won't let you go alone.

195
00:27:02,117 --> 00:27:04,881
You can't come upstairs.
- Will I let you go alone?

196
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,716
So that you can ring up the police?
- No telephones upstairs, believe me.

197
00:27:09,891 --> 00:27:15,090
No, I'll come up with you.
- No, I'll not let you in my bedroom.

198
00:27:16,932 --> 00:27:17,830
Why not?

199
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:20,731
Would you like a stranger
to go into your wife's room?

200
00:27:20,902 --> 00:27:22,392
Don't you talk about my wife.

201
00:27:23,004 --> 00:27:24,835
Why do you flare up at
the mention of your wife?

202
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,238
Don't talk nonsense.
Go get the clothes.

203
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:21,759
Shall I fire?
You think you're clever.

204
00:28:23,598 --> 00:28:26,761
Please forgive me,
I made a mistake.

205
00:28:27,002 --> 00:28:28,970
Don't repeat such a mistake.

206
00:28:37,078 --> 00:28:40,172
Take the clothes
of your choice.

207
00:28:49,224 --> 00:28:52,193
Your husband has a good wardrobe.
What does he do?

208
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:56,854
He's a Sales Executive
in Kings & Kings.

209
00:29:02,037 --> 00:29:03,868
He seems to have lots
of perquisites.

210
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:22,555
How far is the
railway station from here?

211
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:24,619
Quite close.

212
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,822
How long will it take?
- Five minutes.

213
00:29:37,672 --> 00:29:41,233
There's a bathroom upstairs.

214
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:47,011
You think I'm mad; as I go up,
you'll ring the police.

215
00:29:47,182 --> 00:29:49,980
No, I'll change here.
- In my presence?

216
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:53,981
No, in the kitchen.

217
00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:04,055
Keep talking while I change.

218
00:30:04,232 --> 00:30:05,995
Talking?
- Yes, loudly.

219
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:09,136
I'm not made like you.
- Don't discuss, speak.

220
00:30:09,304 --> 00:30:10,362
What?
- Anything.

221
00:30:10,472 --> 00:30:12,406
What about?
- Talk about your husband...

222
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:18,774
or the weather. Your voice must
be continuously heard.

223
00:30:23,184 --> 00:30:25,277
Alright, I shall speak.

224
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:32,924
Since you came into this house...

225
00:30:33,094 --> 00:30:35,062
I've been thinking what sins
I must have committed...

226
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,290
that I've to face these
consequences.

227
00:30:41,336 --> 00:30:45,363
Why didn't you go to another house?
Why did you come here?

228
00:30:47,075 --> 00:30:50,238
When will you leave?
You haven't told me.

229
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:52,312
I shall leave as soon as
I find an opportunity.

230
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,308
You mean you won't go
if you don't get a chance.

231
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:56,450
I shan't go.

232
00:30:59,354 --> 00:31:01,982
Why don't you speak?
- I'm speaking.

233
00:31:18,807 --> 00:31:23,335
I'm trying to trust you and
you're upto this. This telephone!

234
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:27,948
Please don't. People may call
and if it doesn't ring...

235
00:31:28,116 --> 00:31:31,347
will complain and the
telephone men will come.

236
00:31:34,155 --> 00:31:37,022
If you touch it again,
I'll kill you.

237
00:32:24,172 --> 00:32:28,199
Didn't I tell you not to do anything?
I'll kill you!

238
00:32:31,212 --> 00:32:35,012
It must be the police.
If you say a word about me...

239
00:32:35,183 --> 00:32:37,549
this bullet shall
go through you.

240
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:40,588
The key?

241
00:32:59,641 --> 00:33:01,836
Who is it.
- Dr. Trivedi.

242
00:33:09,384 --> 00:33:11,443
Hello.
- Hello, how are you Rekha?

243
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,685
Inspector Dewan, Mrs. Jagmohan

244
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:19,216
Rekha, is Jagmohan at home?

245
00:33:19,427 --> 00:33:23,386
No, he has gone to Calcutta
and is expected tomorrow.

246
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:25,690
Are you all alone in the house?
- Yes.

247
00:33:27,268 --> 00:33:29,133
Are the doors and windows closed.
- Why?

248
00:33:29,704 --> 00:33:33,071
A mad man has escaped from the asylum.
He's a dangerous man.

249
00:33:33,241 --> 00:33:36,472
He has killed his wife.
Be on your guard.

250
00:33:41,516 --> 00:33:45,145
Doctor, doctor, there...

251
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:48,688
What's the matter?

252
00:33:51,526 --> 00:33:59,160
Nothing. Your mentioning
of the madman scared me.

253
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:02,497
Don't be scared. The Police
is on guard outside.

254
00:34:03,304 --> 00:34:06,102
Inspector Dewan. Take
particular care of this house.

255
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:34,832
I had forgotten my hat.

256
00:34:35,503 --> 00:34:38,267
Will you have tea or coffee?

257
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:40,339
No, thank you, I'm in
a hurry at the moment.

258
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:51,543
Why are you so scared?
- No.

259
00:34:53,788 --> 00:35:00,216
My telephone number. Ring me up
if there's anything untoward.

260
00:35:17,745 --> 00:35:22,307
You offered him coffee. You could've
invited him to sleep with you.

261
00:35:23,484 --> 00:35:27,113
You're alone.
Dewan is a young stalwart.

262
00:35:27,288 --> 00:35:29,313
Don't talk nonsense.
- Shut up!

263
00:35:29,857 --> 00:35:31,449
I understand your game.

264
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:36,689
I've told you time and again,
put off every one who calls. But you...

265
00:35:37,765 --> 00:35:40,791
Put off whoever he may be.
Don't let him in.

266
00:35:45,373 --> 00:35:48,399
Who's there?
- Basanti.

267
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:54,608
Were you asleep?
- I was about to retire.

268
00:35:54,882 --> 00:35:57,942
Munna is unwell. The doctor advised
against solid food.

269
00:35:58,152 --> 00:36:00,279
If he insists, he can
have juice.

270
00:36:00,388 --> 00:36:04,290
Munna likes milk. Where will
I get it now?

271
00:36:04,525 --> 00:36:07,892
I thought you would have it.
So I came.

272
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,363
Hasn't Jagmohan returned yet?
- No, he hasn't returned yet.

273
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:15,991
This is the trouble. Once they leave,
they don't return soon.

274
00:36:16,204 --> 00:36:20,231
Ah, what brought me here? Yes,
my milk must be in the kitchen.

275
00:36:20,408 --> 00:36:22,308
I'll go get it.
- Sure.

276
00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:28,544
Please wait Basanti, I'll go
and get it.

277
00:36:28,783 --> 00:36:32,651
Sure. I'll come with you.

278
00:36:35,757 --> 00:36:42,390
Here's plenty, milk, ghee, grapes...
My son loves all this.

279
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:49,462
You look worried.
Let me tell you...

280
00:36:49,704 --> 00:36:52,070
with a couple of children in the
family, you don't have leisure.

281
00:36:52,306 --> 00:36:55,742
You should have two or three
children quickly.

282
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,471
The Government permits it now.
Do it fast. It may change its mind.

283
00:37:02,216 --> 00:37:03,183
The milk...

284
00:37:04,452 --> 00:37:07,683
I've heard that a mad man has
escaped from the lunatic asylum.

285
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:11,256
Did you hear the wireless?
- Queer folks these radio men.

286
00:37:11,426 --> 00:37:13,951
Amidst devotional music
such announcement.

287
00:37:14,128 --> 00:37:16,562
Curse them!
That cinema hit... how does that go?

288
00:37:16,798 --> 00:37:23,704
"I look for my darling in the kitchen
sometimes & in the cupboard"

289
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:30,333
Dear me, I am boring you at
this hour of the night.

290
00:37:30,511 --> 00:37:34,311
I better be going. Let me take
a few apples for my son.

291
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:44,321
Rekha, do you know that Seth who
lives at the top of the street?

292
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:47,791
His wife has eloped with a swami.
Anyway, it's their business. Isn't it?

293
00:37:47,962 --> 00:37:50,726
And that Pran says he considers Preeti
as his sister.

294
00:37:50,932 --> 00:37:54,834
But, that day I went to his house
and I saw it with my own eyes.

295
00:37:55,002 --> 00:38:00,907
Anyway, I don't care about the world.
I keep my mouth shut. Bye.

296
00:38:03,644 --> 00:38:05,874
Oh yes the umbrella. O.K. Rekha.

297
00:38:06,113 --> 00:38:10,914
You better close the doors, Rekha,
lest that madman walks in.

298
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:26,860
Why did you let her in the kitchen?
- I couldn't help it.

299
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:29,366
What if she had seen me?
- What does it matter to you?

300
00:38:29,537 --> 00:38:33,940
You would've killed us both. You're a
habitual killer. You killed your wife...

301
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,982
What have I done to you,
how have I harmed you?

302
00:38:43,551 --> 00:38:51,583
I sheltered you from the police
and you treat me like a prisoner.

303
00:38:51,826 --> 00:38:56,490
Stop crying! It's by chance that
we're prisoners here or else...

304
00:38:56,697 --> 00:38:59,928
I don't enjoy the role of a jailor
or making you a prisoner.

305
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:05,801
Look, you've done me no harm.
It's a matter of one night.

306
00:39:06,073 --> 00:39:08,098
I'll leave before dawn,

307
00:39:09,343 --> 00:39:15,009
I only hope that this
time passes amicably.

308
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,427
I'm tired.

309
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:32,597
I'm shattered!

310
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:50,172
I don't know who deserves
sympathy, you or I.

311
00:39:51,285 --> 00:39:55,517
Do you still think I'm mad?
- No.

312
00:39:57,959 --> 00:40:02,658
Are we enemies?
- No.

313
00:40:02,997 --> 00:40:07,263
Then why are we under such
great strain?

314
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:13,468
Perhaps this is the result of fear.

315
00:40:13,908 --> 00:40:16,172
Fear is the worst thing
in this world.

316
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:19,613
There seems to be so much
evil going on in the world.

317
00:40:20,414 --> 00:40:24,077
It's all because we're afraid
of one another.

318
00:40:25,052 --> 00:40:32,117
If we begin to love one another this
world would be a beautiful place.

319
00:40:33,794 --> 00:40:36,558
Perhaps you're right.

320
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:49,906
Do you have any cigarettes
in the house?

321
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,121
You look worried.

322
00:41:13,634 --> 00:41:15,727
If you don't mind,
may I ask you something?

323
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,939
Yes.
- Do you drink?

324
00:41:23,911 --> 00:41:25,139
Sometimes.

325
00:41:25,913 --> 00:41:28,177
I have some. Jagmohan drinks.

326
00:41:28,849 --> 00:41:31,010
Where is it?
- In that cupboard.

327
00:41:31,185 --> 00:41:34,621
I don't want it now.
I'll have it later.

328
00:41:48,903 --> 00:41:51,770
You go upstairs and sleep.
- I'll sleep here.

329
00:41:51,939 --> 00:41:54,703
Where will you sleep here?
- On the sofa.

330
00:41:54,942 --> 00:41:56,967
On the sofa? All night?
- Yes.

331
00:41:59,213 --> 00:42:03,115
Aren't you scared of me?
- Not anymore.

332
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:08,786
How strange!
You're very puzzling.

333
00:42:35,149 --> 00:42:37,140
Will you please help
me to move this table.

334
00:43:43,117 --> 00:43:48,578
It's midnight. Shall I switch off the
lights? Else, it'll arouse suspicion.

335
00:44:38,939 --> 00:44:41,806
How about a drink?
- I don't drink.

336
00:44:42,676 --> 00:44:44,143
Won't you give me company?

337
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:47,272
I'll have a soft drink.
- Any soda in the house?

338
00:44:48,115 --> 00:44:49,446
Will water do?
- Fine.

339
00:44:55,389 --> 00:44:56,356
Wait!

340
00:44:58,425 --> 00:45:00,154
You won't escape by the back door,
will you?

341
00:45:00,995 --> 00:45:02,428
Don't you trust me?

342
00:45:03,998 --> 00:45:04,965
Go ahead.

343
00:47:22,703 --> 00:47:28,107
When I was a little boy in
Nainital, during winters...

344
00:47:28,342 --> 00:47:31,607
We used to sit around the
hearth and warm ourselves.

345
00:47:33,213 --> 00:47:37,547
Flames cast our
shadows on the walls.

346
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:41,044
I used to stare at the shadows.

347
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:45,617
I saw queer pictures in them.

348
00:47:46,627 --> 00:47:53,556
I wanted to copy those pictures
on paper in beautiful colours.

349
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:19,354
You're very pretty.

350
00:48:24,264 --> 00:48:25,754
Pretty, did you say pretty.

351
00:48:27,534 --> 00:48:28,660
Not really!

352
00:48:38,145 --> 00:48:39,772
The way you're looking at me.

353
00:48:41,882 --> 00:48:43,975
I wish I could paint you.

354
00:48:48,155 --> 00:48:54,390
What was your wife like?
- She was very beautiful.

355
00:48:55,429 --> 00:48:58,887
Were you fond of her?
- Yes, very much...

356
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:08,131
I loved her. You're fond
of Jagmohan, aren't you?

357
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:17,150
When we were about
to be married...

358
00:49:17,317 --> 00:49:20,582
I thought he was a prince
of fairyland, but...

359
00:49:22,556 --> 00:49:27,425
Soon after the wedding,
the prince disappeared.

360
00:49:28,962 --> 00:49:35,595
And I found instead a cold
dry and lifeless Jagmohan.

361
00:49:37,337 --> 00:49:40,568
Who had no interest in
anything apart from his work.

362
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:45,174
He's away twenty
days in a month...

363
00:49:47,214 --> 00:49:52,618
and I'm here all alone,
longing for him.

364
00:49:54,354 --> 00:49:56,447
Then why did you marry him?

365
00:49:57,357 --> 00:50:01,657
It's always later that
tragedy is discovered.

366
00:50:03,564 --> 00:50:05,122
Yes, you're right.

367
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:12,203
That night when I was painting
the picture of my life...

368
00:50:12,406 --> 00:50:16,809
I had a row with my wife.
It was a small tiff.

369
00:50:17,644 --> 00:50:23,480
I could never imagine that
such a tiff would turn out...

370
00:50:24,418 --> 00:50:26,283
When I returned...

371
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,286
I found... found my
wife's corpse lying there.

372
00:50:30,524 --> 00:50:33,982
I was at my wits end.
I went out of my mind.

373
00:50:34,528 --> 00:50:39,488
I was crazy and moved
around like a rabid dog.

374
00:50:45,305 --> 00:50:49,742
Listen, when did you
laugh last?

375
00:50:51,645 --> 00:50:55,172
I don't remember.
- Don't you ever feel like laughing?

376
00:50:57,484 --> 00:51:00,612
Even if I do, I don't
like it anymore.

377
00:51:01,788 --> 00:51:03,312
Shall I make you laugh?

378
00:51:05,626 --> 00:51:06,593
Why?

379
00:51:07,294 --> 00:51:09,194
It's good to laugh after a cry.

380
00:51:10,964 --> 00:51:13,194
Just see how nice you look.
- Am I looking good?

381
00:51:43,597 --> 00:51:46,088
Has that madman come here?
- No, sir.

382
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:47,223
Khan, let's go.

383
00:53:47,053 --> 00:53:48,179
Who?

384
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:50,556
Who is it?

385
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,467
Whom have you called?
- No one.

386
00:54:44,644 --> 00:54:46,544
Why did you take the keys?
- I got scared.

387
00:54:46,646 --> 00:54:49,740
Got scared, did you?
I see through you game.

388
00:54:50,584 --> 00:54:51,744
Go on.

389
00:54:53,019 --> 00:54:57,149
If you try any tricks,
I'll shoot you... and whoever that is.

390
00:54:58,525 --> 00:54:59,492
Wait...

391
00:55:21,681 --> 00:55:25,640
Inspector you here?
- Are you alright Mrs. Jagmohan?

392
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:26,786
Yes, why?

393
00:55:27,053 --> 00:55:31,456
I heard someone shrieking.
Has Jagmohan returned?

394
00:55:31,925 --> 00:55:32,914
Not yet?

395
00:55:33,693 --> 00:55:35,354
Then who screamed?

396
00:55:35,562 --> 00:55:38,326
Nobody here.
Perhaps you're mistaken.

397
00:55:39,966 --> 00:55:44,426
Were you sleeping here on the sofa?
- Yes. My husband was expected.

398
00:55:44,604 --> 00:55:47,869
And the bell can't be heard
in the bedroom. So I slept here.

399
00:56:08,028 --> 00:56:10,121
Which room is this?
- Kitchen.

400
00:56:26,746 --> 00:56:28,509
And what's that?
- Bedroom.

401
00:56:29,482 --> 00:56:30,847
May I look in?

402
00:56:33,753 --> 00:56:36,586
I've told you, my husband
is not at home.

403
00:56:37,891 --> 00:56:39,791
You shouldn't go into my
bedroom.

404
00:57:22,669 --> 00:57:25,194
The inspector has gone.
- How did you put him off?

405
00:57:25,672 --> 00:57:28,402
Put him off! What do you mean?
- Didn't he search the house?

406
00:57:28,608 --> 00:57:29,700
Why should he?

407
00:57:29,809 --> 00:57:33,108
He heard a man shriek,
didn't he, my shriek?

408
00:57:33,279 --> 00:57:35,907
He got it all wrong.
- Was he deceived too?

409
00:57:36,049 --> 00:57:37,539
What're you trying to get at?
I don't understand.

410
00:57:37,717 --> 00:57:41,585
Didn't he look into your bathroom?
- Why? What is in there?

411
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,526
Why're you looking draggers at me?
What's wrong with you?

412
00:57:49,696 --> 00:57:50,924
You slut!

413
00:57:51,831 --> 00:57:55,733
How dare you hit me!
I could've got you arrested.

414
00:57:55,969 --> 00:57:58,301
I didn't let the inspector
approach the bedroom.

415
00:57:58,471 --> 00:58:02,168
I stood in his way and saved you.
- Not me, but yourself!

416
00:58:02,976 --> 00:58:05,570
Had he come into the bedroom,
he would've gone to the bathroom...

417
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:08,045
the door was open.
- Why are you harping on the bathroom?

418
00:58:08,214 --> 00:58:12,014
I'm not harping,
but stating a fact.

419
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:16,120
Jagmohan's dead body is in the
bathroom. Your husband is lying dead.

420
00:58:16,523 --> 00:58:20,425
What nonsense! You're crazy,
you're out of your senses.

421
00:58:20,627 --> 00:58:24,324
I'm not dreaming, mean slut!
You've murdered your husband...

422
00:58:24,497 --> 00:58:29,127
and hidden his corpse in the bathroom.
Go on and see for yourself.

423
00:58:31,738 --> 00:58:34,969
What shall I see?
Come, see yourself.

424
00:58:47,153 --> 00:58:53,149
No! I saw his dead body with
my own eyes. Yes I did.

425
00:58:53,326 --> 00:58:55,988
You've seen nothing,
you're mad.

426
00:58:56,196 --> 00:58:59,256
Ever since you murdered your
wife and seen her dead body...

427
00:58:59,432 --> 00:59:02,299
You're obsessed with corpse...

428
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:05,597
you see a corpse
wherever you go.

429
00:59:05,772 --> 00:59:09,868
There's no dead body.
Nobody's been murdered.

430
00:59:10,043 --> 00:59:13,672
It's all in your mind your
imagination, your hallucination.

431
00:59:16,349 --> 00:59:23,812
Perhaps you're right, its my
fancy, my illusion.

432
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:26,622
I'm mad.

433
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:35,765
You're a nice person,
but you're mentally disturbed.

434
00:59:36,736 --> 00:59:40,035
Calm down, compose yourself.

435
00:59:44,144 --> 00:59:48,672
Please forgive me.
I've troubled you a great deal.

436
00:59:50,683 --> 00:59:55,347
I hit you, I've really
gone mad.

437
00:59:56,689 --> 01:00:00,455
Perhaps in such a fit,
I murdered my wife.

438
01:00:02,829 --> 01:00:05,354
Renu was right.

439
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:28,084
These are photographs of the
fingerprints on the palate.

440
01:00:31,391 --> 01:00:32,790
Here's something significant.

441
01:00:47,507 --> 01:00:51,341
Have you any clue about him
my brother-in-law.

442
01:00:52,812 --> 01:00:56,373
I feel scared all the time
because I deposed against him.

443
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,383
You deposed against him.
So what?

444
01:00:58,585 --> 01:01:01,918
I'm afraid, he might avenge me since
he was arrested on my accusation.

445
01:01:02,288 --> 01:01:05,314
After my sister, he might
be my enemy.

446
01:01:47,117 --> 01:01:51,247
What's the matter, Inspector?
- I heard you scream on the telephone.

447
01:01:51,855 --> 01:01:55,848
I was scared, the window
blew open. I feared it was him.

448
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:01,119
You're obsessed with Dilip Rai.
- Can't help it.

449
01:02:01,298 --> 01:02:04,495
I testified against him
so I live with this fear.

450
01:02:05,502 --> 01:02:09,871
What's there to be afraid of?
The police are here, so are we.

451
01:02:21,118 --> 01:02:23,211
Is Dilip Rai's room open?
- Why?

452
01:02:23,387 --> 01:02:26,288
Can I look in?
- Yes, go ahead.

453
01:02:54,584 --> 01:02:56,245
Where does this
door lead to?

454
01:02:58,088 --> 01:02:59,316
This is my bedroom.

455
01:03:01,224 --> 01:03:02,623
It doesn't matter,
please come in.

456
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:13,330
This is the bedroom and
that's Rai's studio...

457
01:03:14,204 --> 01:03:18,334
and a door in between...
- You've guessed it wrong, I hate him.

458
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:21,077
Why?

459
01:03:21,545 --> 01:03:26,141
He married my sister for money,
never really cared for her.

460
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:30,014
Hence they always
quarrelled and they...

461
01:03:31,588 --> 01:03:32,555
Take care.

462
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:36,017
It's beautiful.

463
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,353
You're all by yourself,
aren't you?

464
01:03:40,263 --> 01:03:42,993
What else can I do?
- You're so rich...

465
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:46,158
you've a spacious house.
Why don't you get married?

466
01:03:49,406 --> 01:03:53,103
After Sushma's death, I've
lost all interest in life.

467
01:03:57,547 --> 01:03:59,037
It opens into the hall.

468
01:04:02,919 --> 01:04:07,720
Don't be scared.
If there's anything, please ring.

469
01:04:22,439 --> 01:04:24,805
Miss Renu, this is Khanna,
are you alright?

470
01:04:25,075 --> 01:04:26,906
Everything is normal
except that...

471
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:30,878
ever since my brother-in-law
escaped from the lunatic asylum.

472
01:04:32,249 --> 01:04:37,084
Why're you afraid, we're here?

473
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:41,416
There's no need to fear.
Ring if anything happens.

474
01:05:19,496 --> 01:05:22,124
What sound was that?
- A man's scream.

475
01:05:22,499 --> 01:05:24,967
But Jagmohan is not at home.
- And the phone has been cut off.

476
01:06:05,408 --> 01:06:08,377
Hello, Railway Inquiry?
When is 23 up due?

477
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,509
4.35... I hope she isn't
running late.

478
01:06:19,189 --> 01:06:22,852
It's time to bid goodbye
Mrs. Jagmohan.

479
01:06:23,693 --> 01:06:27,754
The train is running on time.
- Can I do anything for you?

480
01:06:29,065 --> 01:06:31,932
I'm sorry for what happened.

481
01:06:32,502 --> 01:06:35,596
Your forgiveness is all
that I care for.

482
01:06:36,006 --> 01:06:38,941
Where will you go?
- I can't say...

483
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:44,770
wherever my luck leads me.
I wish to go far far away.

484
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:51,783
Wife murdered, police, lunatic
asylum, doctor, your house.

485
01:06:52,489 --> 01:06:54,423
They're all suffocating.

486
01:06:54,724 --> 01:06:59,058
I wish to go far away.
I'm suffocating here.

487
01:06:59,796 --> 01:07:06,224
I want to go where I can breathe easily,
reconsider my possibilities.

488
01:07:11,474 --> 01:07:13,567
Who's that?
- Dr. Trivedi.

489
01:07:17,514 --> 01:07:23,248
Of all the times, he had to come now.
Perhaps I'm dogged by bad luck.

490
01:07:34,898 --> 01:07:37,162
Go open the door.

491
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:56,214
Is everything okay, Rekha?
Nothing wrong I hope.

492
01:07:56,386 --> 01:07:58,479
No.
- Is Jagmohan back?

493
01:07:58,655 --> 01:08:01,215
No.
- Then who was on the telephone?

494
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:03,416
On telephone!
- Yes, it was a scream.

495
01:08:03,593 --> 01:08:06,687
There wasn't a soul here.
- Nobody, but how can that be.

496
01:08:06,863 --> 01:08:09,423
The scream was very clear.
Wasn't it Diwan?

497
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,829
Yes, somebody shouted,
put it down.

498
01:08:13,236 --> 01:08:16,433
Was it someone from the neighbourhood?
- There was no neighbour.

499
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,435
Then who was it?
- We couldn't be mistaken.

500
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:23,909
It seemed as if someone was
preventing your speaking.

501
01:08:30,754 --> 01:08:33,314
Wait Rekha, I'll take it.

502
01:08:36,693 --> 01:08:39,218
Trunk call from Calcutta?

503
01:08:40,497 --> 01:08:41,828
Is that Jagmohan?

504
01:08:42,699 --> 01:08:45,725
Sorry! You wish to speak to Jagmohan?

505
01:08:46,703 --> 01:08:49,069
Since three days.
Did you say three?

506
01:08:49,906 --> 01:08:51,874
What! Should I send him
back to Calcutta immediately?

507
01:08:52,842 --> 01:08:57,905
But he's still in Calcutta...
How can that be?

508
01:08:59,716 --> 01:09:02,913
Did you see him off on the
afternoon flight yesterday.

509
01:09:04,888 --> 01:09:10,417
But he hasn't arrived yet.
Jagmohan hasn't reached here yet.

510
01:09:12,796 --> 01:09:15,492
That is strange!
- What is it, Doctor?

511
01:09:15,665 --> 01:09:18,190
The manager of the Calcutta
firm was on phone.

512
01:09:18,401 --> 01:09:20,460
He said that Jagmohan had
returned here.

513
01:09:20,637 --> 01:09:22,434
Returned?
- Yes.

514
01:09:22,605 --> 01:09:25,438
He himself saw him on
the afternoon flight yesterday.

515
01:09:25,608 --> 01:09:28,304
According to this, he should
have been here by six p.m.

516
01:09:28,478 --> 01:09:32,471
But he isn't here, I'm worried.
- It's certainly a matter of anxiety.

517
01:09:32,916 --> 01:09:35,714
If he's back from Calcutta,
then why hasn't he come home?

518
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:45,721
Look at this cigarette stubs
and these two glasses.

519
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:48,724
It shows there
was another man.

520
01:09:50,467 --> 01:09:52,025
A cigarette stub...

521
01:10:00,643 --> 01:10:04,170
Jagmohan is not here then
who can be the other person.

522
01:10:04,347 --> 01:10:05,746
Dilip Rai!
- Dilip Rai?

523
01:10:07,484 --> 01:10:11,215
Look at these clothes. In these
clothes he escaped the asylum.

524
01:10:13,523 --> 01:10:17,425
It means, Dilip Rai made straight
to this house from the asylum.

525
01:10:19,095 --> 01:10:20,756
That's why Rekha is scared.

526
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,766
Rekha, you're trying to conceal
something; you're frightened.

527
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:31,503
I can read your face.
Don't be scared.

528
01:10:31,674 --> 01:10:35,633
Where is Dilip Rai?
Where is that mad man?

529
01:10:36,012 --> 01:10:38,378
Don't worry, he can't
do a thing to you.

530
01:10:38,548 --> 01:10:40,516
Diwan and I are here to
take care of you.

531
01:10:41,017 --> 01:10:44,509
Go on, tell us where he is.
Where's that mad man?

532
01:10:44,687 --> 01:10:47,781
I don't know.

533
01:10:51,661 --> 01:10:54,221
I'll shoot whoever
steps forward.

534
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:17,047
Looks as if he made a good escape.
- Smashed his way through the window.

535
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:23,684
How could he jump from such
a height? Beats me.

536
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:26,420
A mad man will do anything.
Where has he gone?

537
01:11:26,596 --> 01:11:28,530
I know.
- Where? Could you tell us?

538
01:11:28,698 --> 01:11:32,828
Station. He was to leave by 4.35.
- Still time. Let's go Diwan.

539
01:11:36,806 --> 01:11:40,503
If you leave doctor, I will
be left alone again. I'm scared.

540
01:11:40,677 --> 01:11:42,702
Don't be scared.
He won't come here now.

541
01:11:42,879 --> 01:11:46,144
You've sleeping pills,
take one and go to bed.

542
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,905
Not you, but I'll send for
the police, you slut.

543
01:12:53,516 --> 01:12:58,044
I'm convinced that it was
Jagmohan's corpse.

544
01:12:58,354 --> 01:13:00,788
Jagmohan returned from Calcutta
and you murdered him.

545
01:13:00,957 --> 01:13:04,188
I don't know why you did it,
but you killed him.

546
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,158
No, no I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

547
01:13:08,131 --> 01:13:11,589
You knew everything you had
heard on the wireless...

548
01:13:12,035 --> 01:13:14,595
that a mad man had escaped
from the lunatic asylum.

549
01:13:14,804 --> 01:13:17,602
When I came into this house...

550
01:13:17,807 --> 01:13:20,799
you thought you could accuse
me of you husband's murder.

551
01:13:21,044 --> 01:13:27,950
You tried to win me by getting
me drunk and thus confuse me.

552
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:30,881
You could've easily escaped
if you had wanted.

553
01:13:31,054 --> 01:13:34,421
When the doctor and Diwan came in,
you could've told them.

554
01:13:34,624 --> 01:13:39,755
But you didn't which means
you were scared of me.

555
01:13:40,129 --> 01:13:43,690
But it wasn't fright, but pretense.
Tell me where is the corpse?

556
01:13:43,866 --> 01:13:47,700
There was no corpse here,
you're mad. You murdered your wife.

557
01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:51,135
I'm not mad, nor did I
kill my wife.

558
01:13:51,874 --> 01:13:55,970
There has been a murder in this house.
And I saw the corpse with my own eyes.

559
01:13:56,679 --> 01:14:01,173
I don't want any innocent person
to suffer the consequences.

560
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:05,114
I know too well what happens.

561
01:14:05,888 --> 01:14:11,326
I won't leave till
the murder is known. Come with me.

562
01:14:23,806 --> 01:14:24,864
Khanna here.

563
01:14:25,074 --> 01:14:25,904
Tell me.

564
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:30,475
Dilip Rai hasn't been arrested,
what's being done?

565
01:14:31,247 --> 01:14:35,240
Arrest him as soon as possible. You
know what a dangerous killer he is!

566
01:14:35,551 --> 01:14:38,418
We're doing our best and hope
to catch him soon.

567
01:14:42,825 --> 01:14:45,760
It was Khanna on the phone. He wants
Rai arrested as soon as possible.

568
01:14:47,463 --> 01:14:50,694
Why is everybody so
interested in Dilip Rai? Beats me.

569
01:14:51,267 --> 01:14:55,761
Khanna wants him arrested soon.
And Miss Renu wants the same thing.

570
01:14:56,072 --> 01:14:59,041
You know people take keen
interest in a murder case.

571
01:14:59,809 --> 01:15:04,041
It seems a very strange murder to me.
You know Karve...

572
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:09,173
there's a motive behind every murder.
What would Dilip Rai's motive be?

573
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:14,789
His wife was a wealthy woman.
- So what? He himself is a rich man.

574
01:15:16,025 --> 01:15:17,788
There can be another woman.

575
01:15:18,828 --> 01:15:22,229
I made inquiries about his character.
Everyone speaks well of him.

576
01:15:22,932 --> 01:15:26,868
Insanity alone. This can be the cause.
- I don't think he's insane.

577
01:15:27,336 --> 01:15:32,535
We took his wrath for madness. When an
innocent person is unjustly blamed...

578
01:15:32,709 --> 01:15:34,802
and finds himself helpless,
then he loses his temper...

579
01:15:34,911 --> 01:15:38,210
and thus he seems
to be insane.

580
01:15:51,394 --> 01:15:52,554
Look at this.

581
01:15:53,863 --> 01:15:56,093
Seems a part of an ornament.
- Yes, they are pearls.

582
01:15:56,265 --> 01:15:58,699
But of which ornaments?
Nose-ring, earring or a necklace?

583
01:15:58,868 --> 01:16:02,964
Whatever it is, but the fact is that
they were in this palate.

584
01:16:03,906 --> 01:16:09,105
According to photographs, the palate
had finger prints of someone else...

585
01:16:09,345 --> 01:16:11,779
besides Dilip Rai and his wife.

586
01:16:13,883 --> 01:16:18,217
Could these pearls give us any clue?
- It's possible.

587
01:16:19,288 --> 01:16:24,248
I think I've seen these pearls
somewhere. Where?

588
01:16:32,769 --> 01:16:36,136
Where have you seen, what?
I'm coming straight away.

589
01:17:06,202 --> 01:17:08,432
We couldn't trace him anywhere.
We searched the train.

590
01:17:08,604 --> 01:17:11,835
Doctor, please help me. He'll kill me.
He hasn't gone anywhere...

591
01:17:12,008 --> 01:17:13,305
he is still here.
- Where is he?

592
01:17:13,509 --> 01:17:14,976
I'm here.

593
01:17:15,278 --> 01:17:19,180
Stay where you are,
or I'll shoot.

594
01:17:21,117 --> 01:17:23,915
Don't be crazy, Rai.
- I'm not mad.

595
01:17:24,086 --> 01:17:26,782
You people have
taken me to be mad.

596
01:17:26,956 --> 01:17:31,325
Believe me, doctor, I'm not mad.
I'm a victim of bad luck.

597
01:17:32,028 --> 01:17:34,428
One after another I got
involved into incidents.

598
01:17:35,097 --> 01:17:38,396
From my house to the court...
from the court to the asylum.

599
01:17:38,568 --> 01:17:41,230
And from the asylum to
Jagmohan's house.

600
01:17:42,071 --> 01:17:45,404
You know what happened in between
the court and the asylum.

601
01:17:46,142 --> 01:17:51,011
The story from my house to
the court will be clarified.

602
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:58,348
I'll explain what happened from
the court to Jagmohan house.

603
01:17:59,021 --> 01:18:01,888
After that you can do
as you please.

604
01:18:02,124 --> 01:18:06,891
You may hang me or lock me up
forever in an asylum.

605
01:18:07,129 --> 01:18:12,362
Lock him up, doctor, he's insane.
He'll make us crazy too.

606
01:18:14,971 --> 01:18:18,168
Don't be afraid, doctor,
I won't shoot you.

607
01:18:18,274 --> 01:18:23,007
I respect you. Besides being
a good doctor, you're a good man too.

608
01:18:23,346 --> 01:18:26,247
I trust you, here it is.

609
01:18:29,051 --> 01:18:30,382
Hold it, Diwan.

610
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:35,386
Please go ahead with your story Rai.

611
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:39,925
When I was running away
from the asylum...

612
01:18:40,096 --> 01:18:42,360
with the police jeep
in hot pursuit...

613
01:18:42,531 --> 01:18:45,932
the first house I found
was this house.

614
01:18:46,102 --> 01:18:48,593
The door was locked but
the rear window was open.

615
01:18:48,704 --> 01:18:53,869
I jumped in and heard the news
of my escape on the Radio.

616
01:18:53,976 --> 01:18:58,072
Hearing the news, Mrs. Jagmohan
shut the windows.

617
01:18:58,314 --> 01:19:02,148
As she was closing the door,
I jumped and covered her mouth...

618
01:19:02,318 --> 01:19:06,448
and threatened her that if she
spoke about me, I'd kill her.

619
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:11,353
She never spoke a word about me.

620
01:19:11,527 --> 01:19:14,724
When you and Diwan came to give
her the news of my escape.

621
01:19:14,897 --> 01:19:16,865
I was hiding here
in the bedroom.

622
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,567
Then?

623
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:24,501
Then after a short row,
we became friends.

624
01:19:25,141 --> 01:19:27,974
Mrs. Jagmohan offered me
liquor and I drank it.

625
01:19:29,946 --> 01:19:34,315
She sat besides me,
we were tired.

626
01:19:36,185 --> 01:19:39,916
She from her burden and
I from mine.

627
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:45,117
We decided that life is too short...

628
01:19:45,294 --> 01:19:47,319
so we should learn to laugh
and forget our misery.

629
01:19:48,097 --> 01:19:55,003
We laughed. After a while
I went off to sleep.

630
01:19:55,204 --> 01:19:58,662
That's nonsense, that's a lie;
we were never friends.

631
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:01,071
From the moment he came here,
I've been a prisoner.

632
01:20:01,243 --> 01:20:04,804
Let him speak Rekha.
Yes, Rai...

633
01:20:05,481 --> 01:20:09,941
I was tired, I don't know
how long I was asleep...

634
01:20:10,119 --> 01:20:12,883
When I woke up, it was
still before dawn...

635
01:20:14,123 --> 01:20:16,956
I didn't see Mrs. Jagmohan
in the room.

636
01:20:17,126 --> 01:20:19,094
Perturbed, I looked
around for her.

637
01:20:19,261 --> 01:20:22,662
When I stepped in the bathroom,
I was dumb founded.

638
01:20:22,832 --> 01:20:26,495
He's crazy! He's out of his mind!
Don't believe a word of what he says.

639
01:20:28,571 --> 01:20:32,473
Why were you dumb founded, Rai?
What did you see?

640
01:20:33,609 --> 01:20:35,099
Jagmohan's corpse.

641
01:20:35,544 --> 01:20:39,415
Jagmohan's corpse?
No, how can that be?

642
01:20:39,415 --> 01:20:42,441
Believe me, I saw Jagmohan's
corpse with my own eyes.

643
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:45,385
Let's check the bathroom.

644
01:20:49,225 --> 01:20:51,591
Jagmohan's corpse
isn't there now.

645
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:57,054
The corpse was there and
now it's not there.

646
01:20:57,233 --> 01:21:00,691
This is precisely what I mean. It's
all his imagination, hallucination!

647
01:21:00,936 --> 01:21:03,200
I thought so too, doctor.

648
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:06,203
But when you came here and
it was conveyed on the phone...

649
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:09,401
that Jagmohan had returned
from Calcutta. I was convinced that...

650
01:21:09,578 --> 01:21:14,174
he came home and was murdered.
It occurred to me that...

651
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:18,548
If I went away, nobody could
tell that his corpse was here.

652
01:21:18,888 --> 01:21:21,220
I'm the only eye witness.

653
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:25,421
I decided not to leave the
house at my risk.

654
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:32,567
I stayed so that no innocent
person will get involved.

655
01:21:33,702 --> 01:21:37,866
Do you want us to believe your
cock-and-bull stories?

656
01:21:38,074 --> 01:21:42,773
A corpse cannot walk away. If you've
seen it, tell us where is it?

657
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:44,606
The corpse is here.

658
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:51,449
Who is Mrs. Jagmohan?

659
01:21:54,223 --> 01:21:55,747
I'm C.I.D. Inspector Karve.

660
01:22:20,516 --> 01:22:22,916
Can you come and
identify the corpse?

661
01:22:32,194 --> 01:22:35,527
What happened, Jagmohan?
Why've you deserted me?

662
01:22:35,698 --> 01:22:38,166
O God! Who could
have killed you?

663
01:22:40,336 --> 01:22:43,794
Yes, this is the corpse that I saw
in the bathroom, Doctor. This is it.

664
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:52,972
Sinner! You've killed my husband,
you damned murderer!

665
01:22:53,215 --> 01:22:58,118
Take him away, inspector.
He has killed my husband.

666
01:22:58,287 --> 01:23:05,193
He has shattered my home. Take him
away, Inspector. He's a killer!

667
01:23:07,263 --> 01:23:10,323
This is a damned lie.
This woman is a liar.

668
01:23:10,633 --> 01:23:12,260
It's not she, but
you are a liar.

669
01:23:13,369 --> 01:23:16,827
If you permit me, inspector,
I would like to say something.

670
01:23:17,306 --> 01:23:18,273
Go ahead.

671
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:21,432
You know Dilip Rai, don't you?
- Yes.

672
01:23:22,211 --> 01:23:24,338
He was arrested for his
wife's murder.

673
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:26,946
You also know that he was
sent to the lunatic asylum.

674
01:23:27,349 --> 01:23:28,281
Yes, I know.

675
01:23:28,484 --> 01:23:33,285
I think when Dilip Rai escaped
from the lunatic asylum...

676
01:23:33,455 --> 01:23:37,221
and was in search of some hide out,
he met Jagmohan...

677
01:23:37,459 --> 01:23:40,326
who must have heard his name
and identity.

678
01:23:40,496 --> 01:23:43,192
Jagmohan must have tried to
catch him...

679
01:23:43,365 --> 01:23:46,892
and in the ensuing scuffle,
Dilip Rai murdered Jagmohan.

680
01:23:47,002 --> 01:23:48,162
This is a...

681
01:23:48,804 --> 01:23:51,170
What do you think, doctor?

682
01:23:52,374 --> 01:23:59,780
Dilip Rai was in our charge. He was in
a state of insanity when he escaped.

683
01:24:00,516 --> 01:24:05,215
He could have murdered anybody.
- I never set my eyes on him alive.

684
01:24:05,387 --> 01:24:08,185
I saw his corpse for the first time
in the house... in this very bathroom.

685
01:24:08,557 --> 01:24:10,582
How did it find its way out?

686
01:24:12,561 --> 01:24:16,190
I don't know a thing about it.
- Can you recall...

687
01:24:16,365 --> 01:24:18,765
what happened in between when you saw
the corpse and its disappearance?

688
01:24:20,169 --> 01:24:21,397
I can't recall...

689
01:24:39,588 --> 01:24:41,249
Oh yes, I remember.
- What had happened?

690
01:24:47,596 --> 01:24:50,759
The corpse was here.
I tried to run away.

691
01:24:53,569 --> 01:24:55,469
When I reached the door
the bell rang.

692
01:24:55,571 --> 01:24:59,268
Before I could have a word with
Mrs. Jagmohan, the door opened.

693
01:24:59,742 --> 01:25:01,141
I ran and hid in the bedroom.

694
01:25:03,812 --> 01:25:06,645
A man came in through the door.

695
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:09,511
They talked a while, then
went into the kitchen.

696
01:25:09,752 --> 01:25:11,447
Then she came out of the
kitchen...

697
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:14,817
and blocked my view of the
hall completely, from the keyhole.

698
01:25:15,491 --> 01:25:19,325
I thought she was trying
to save me. No!

699
01:25:21,096 --> 01:25:24,862
Actually she was trying to
save herself.

700
01:25:25,801 --> 01:25:30,465
Just at that moment to my bad luck...
a train happened to pass.

701
01:25:30,939 --> 01:25:32,668
It's rattling noise muffled
every sound.

702
01:25:32,908 --> 01:25:35,069
I could neither hear
nor see anything.

703
01:25:37,446 --> 01:25:40,938
Then after a while, the door opened.
The man had left...

704
01:25:41,116 --> 01:25:42,811
and the corpse in the
bathroom disappeared.

705
01:25:43,886 --> 01:25:46,684
The corpse was in this
bathroom, wasn't it?

706
01:25:46,855 --> 01:25:48,413
Yes, this very one.

707
01:27:37,766 --> 01:27:39,791
Do you know the man
who came in here?

708
01:27:39,968 --> 01:27:41,868
Yes, I know him.
- Where is he?

709
01:27:42,037 --> 01:27:44,733
He is here at the moment.
- Who is he?

710
01:27:44,907 --> 01:27:45,737
This one.

711
01:27:45,841 --> 01:27:47,274
Me? This is nonsense.

712
01:27:47,443 --> 01:27:49,502
Whenever I came here,
it was with Dr. Trivedi.

713
01:27:49,678 --> 01:27:53,409
I don't know Mrs. Jagmohan. My coming
here alone is out of question.

714
01:27:56,952 --> 01:27:59,420
Is that so Mrs. Jagmohan?

715
01:27:59,621 --> 01:28:03,523
Yes, the first time I ever
saw him was with the doctor.

716
01:28:03,692 --> 01:28:07,560
Diwan did come here, Inspector.
I saw him with my own eyes.

717
01:28:07,863 --> 01:28:09,694
Mrs. Jagmohan is lying.

718
01:28:09,865 --> 01:28:12,959
Look at this, Inspector.

719
01:28:14,803 --> 01:28:18,830
You've heard the murderer.
Now listen to the murdered.

720
01:28:19,641 --> 01:28:22,838
The victim has the name
and address in his grip.

721
01:28:25,781 --> 01:28:28,648
Here's badge No. 27.

722
01:28:38,894 --> 01:28:41,454
Yes. This badge is of the
lunatic asylum.

723
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:44,463
And this was on Dilip Rai's
shirt when he escaped.

724
01:28:46,435 --> 01:28:49,404
This badge must have got
into Jagmohan's hand.

725
01:28:49,571 --> 01:28:54,099
When Dilip Rai attacked him
and there was a scuffle.

726
01:29:09,791 --> 01:29:11,691
We've heard two stories.

727
01:29:12,094 --> 01:29:15,086
One of the murderer and the
other of the murdered.

728
01:29:16,131 --> 01:29:19,623
The story of the victim is
that he came across the killer.

729
01:29:19,801 --> 01:29:24,295
He was attacked and killed
in the ensuing scuffle.

730
01:29:24,673 --> 01:29:26,197
And the proof is the badge.

731
01:29:27,409 --> 01:29:30,401
The killer's stand is that
he never saw the victim alive...

732
01:29:30,579 --> 01:29:33,514
he only saw his corpse
in the bathroom.

733
01:29:33,749 --> 01:29:37,583
There's nothing else
to prove his innocence.

734
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:44,916
Now we've to find out the truth.
It is important to establish...

735
01:29:45,093 --> 01:29:50,190
whether Jagmohan came into
his house, alive or not.

736
01:30:03,245 --> 01:30:06,612
When did you last see your husband,
Mrs. Jagmohan?

737
01:30:07,583 --> 01:30:10,746
Last week, when he was
leaving for Calcutta.

738
01:30:10,986 --> 01:30:12,613
You never saw
him after that?

739
01:30:14,156 --> 01:30:16,624
No.
- Are you sure?

740
01:30:19,728 --> 01:30:22,253
Then how did this ticket
come here?

741
01:30:22,831 --> 01:30:26,198
I found this in your bathroom.
- I don't know.

742
01:30:29,671 --> 01:30:31,468
This ticket is for the journey
from Calcutta to Bombay.

743
01:30:32,674 --> 01:30:37,441
It bears yesterday's date for the
return journey and Jagmohan's name.

744
01:30:39,014 --> 01:30:43,280
According to this ticket, he should've
been here last evening at six.

745
01:30:50,792 --> 01:30:55,661
This ticket does prove that
Jagmohan came here last evening.

746
01:30:55,831 --> 01:30:59,665
Or how else could the ticket be here?
- Your guess seems to be correct.

747
01:31:00,268 --> 01:31:02,998
There could be another possibility.
- What's that?

748
01:31:03,171 --> 01:31:04,798
It is possible that the
ticket was thrown in later.

749
01:31:04,973 --> 01:31:06,133
Meaning?

750
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:09,601
In the ensuing scuffle between
the murderer and the murdered...

751
01:31:09,778 --> 01:31:12,042
just as the victim was left
with the killer's badge, similarly...

752
01:31:12,214 --> 01:31:15,547
the murderer found
the victim's ticket.

753
01:31:15,784 --> 01:31:19,015
When he came into this house,
he slipped it in the bathroom...

754
01:31:19,187 --> 01:31:23,021
to prove that the corpse
was in this house.

755
01:31:25,127 --> 01:31:28,756
This is a lie invented to entangle me.
I haven't killed anyone.

756
01:31:28,930 --> 01:31:33,026
If I had, I would've escaped.
I didn't because there wouldn't...

757
01:31:33,201 --> 01:31:36,762
have been anybody to bear witness
for the presence of the corpse here.

758
01:31:37,305 --> 01:31:38,897
Another explanation can be that...

759
01:31:39,074 --> 01:31:41,201
after having committed the murder
in a fit of madness...

760
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:46,678
you started thinking a way out
for yourself. And the best way...

761
01:31:46,848 --> 01:31:51,842
would be to hide in this house.
Else, why would you hide here?

762
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:55,786
This is mere coincidence.
- It's not a coincidence but a plan.

763
01:31:58,026 --> 01:32:01,723
I've been watching you closely.
Even since you murdered your wife...

764
01:32:01,897 --> 01:32:04,127
every moment of
yours has been noted.

765
01:32:04,499 --> 01:32:09,129
Just the way you strangled your wife,
you strangled Jagmohan too.

766
01:32:09,304 --> 01:32:11,067
This is a lie! It's nonsense.

767
01:32:12,874 --> 01:32:16,366
Stop acting. I'm inspector Karve,
you ought to know.

768
01:32:16,778 --> 01:32:21,408
I arrest you for murder.
- No! No!

769
01:32:25,153 --> 01:32:26,950
Have you noted down the proceedings?
- In the process.

770
01:32:27,122 --> 01:32:29,249
How long will that take?
- Another five or ten minutes.

771
01:32:30,325 --> 01:32:32,816
See that you get everybody's
signatures, when it's complete.

772
01:32:32,994 --> 01:32:34,757
I'll wait.
- Right Sir.

773
01:32:37,399 --> 01:32:39,094
Mr Rai's gun.

774
01:32:41,069 --> 01:32:43,094
What a queer character
this Rai is! What say, Dewan?

775
01:32:44,673 --> 01:32:47,733
Under a spell of insanity, he murders.
And when he recovers...

776
01:32:47,909 --> 01:32:52,107
he tries to find a way out.
His planning is unrivalled.

777
01:32:53,148 --> 01:32:55,639
In my entire professional career...

778
01:32:55,817 --> 01:32:59,344
I've never come across such a
criminal case of Schizophrenia.

779
01:33:16,037 --> 01:33:17,402
What are you upto now?

780
01:33:18,974 --> 01:33:21,272
Before we leave,
I wish to question Diwan.

781
01:33:21,443 --> 01:33:25,743
Keep your questions for the court now.
- It'll be too late then.

782
01:33:26,047 --> 01:33:28,481
That question can only be
asked here now, not later.

783
01:33:30,919 --> 01:33:32,477
Let him ask. There's no harm.

784
01:33:33,855 --> 01:33:34,822
Go ahead.

785
01:33:40,562 --> 01:33:43,053
Are you sure you never stepped
into this house alone?

786
01:33:43,298 --> 01:33:46,756
Please think and reply.
- I never came here alone.

787
01:33:46,935 --> 01:33:49,529
You're lying.
I'll remind you.

788
01:33:49,704 --> 01:33:51,934
When I came here on my escape
from the asylum last evening...

789
01:33:52,107 --> 01:33:55,804
you first came here with Dr. Trivedi
and then alone later...

790
01:33:56,511 --> 01:33:59,446
after hearing a scream,
I screamed.

791
01:33:59,614 --> 01:34:03,778
It's your flight of fancy.
- Please think more deeply.

792
01:34:04,286 --> 01:34:07,949
You spoke to Mrs. Jagmohan here
and lit your cigarette.

793
01:34:08,123 --> 01:34:10,557
You're mad your
mind is confused.

794
01:34:10,725 --> 01:34:13,592
And your mind is clear...
then why can't you recollect?

795
01:34:14,863 --> 01:34:16,421
You're wasting our time.

796
01:34:18,266 --> 01:34:24,637
When a man becomes helpless,
he invokes God's grace.

797
01:34:25,874 --> 01:34:32,109
I too, with God's grace, put
my empty hands in his pocket.

798
01:34:37,085 --> 01:34:41,283
A man's lapse sometimes
results in God's justice.

799
01:34:42,023 --> 01:34:45,618
See God has helped again.

800
01:34:46,361 --> 01:34:49,922
It's a lighter.
- Ask him, where did he get it?

801
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:54,528
This isn't a matter of interrogation.
Anybody can have it.

802
01:34:54,703 --> 01:34:56,671
It is freely available.
- Yes, I bought it from the market.

803
01:34:56,838 --> 01:34:58,931
This is mine.
- Lies! This lighter belongs to me.

804
01:34:59,341 --> 01:35:02,868
When you came into this house alone
you lit your cigarette...

805
01:35:03,044 --> 01:35:05,012
with this lighter, and by chance
took it with you.

806
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:08,274
This chance is God's justice.

807
01:35:09,918 --> 01:35:12,113
Is there anything special about it
that you say it's yours?

808
01:35:12,287 --> 01:35:14,949
My sister-in-law gave
this lighter to me.

809
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:53,992
I'm speaking on behalf
of Inspector Karve.

810
01:35:54,829 --> 01:36:00,790
He wants you here...
Yes, for a short while.

811
01:36:00,969 --> 01:36:04,200
Come immediately to
22 Gandhi Nagar...

812
01:36:15,150 --> 01:36:18,210
Go up and closely examine the house
before you complete the report.

813
01:36:25,493 --> 01:36:29,293
How strange, doctor,
that this small thing...

814
01:36:29,464 --> 01:36:32,956
which can neither hear,
nor see, nor speak...

815
01:36:33,134 --> 01:36:36,831
is to be a conclusive proof
in this murder case.

816
01:36:37,505 --> 01:36:39,973
This trifle lighter will
prove whether...

817
01:36:40,141 --> 01:36:42,974
Inspector Diwan came alone
to this house.

818
01:36:43,144 --> 01:36:46,545
And whether Rai saw that
corpse or not.

819
01:36:50,151 --> 01:36:51,914
Please come here, Inspector.

820
01:37:16,177 --> 01:37:18,077
Good you've come.

821
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:24,550
Good you arrested him, Inspector.
Don't let him go, never.

822
01:37:26,221 --> 01:37:30,954
Another murder has been committed
and Rai is accused of it.

823
01:37:31,159 --> 01:37:34,094
He must have done it.
He can kill anybody.

824
01:37:34,329 --> 01:37:36,627
This lighter is an important
proof in this murder case.

825
01:37:37,065 --> 01:37:41,161
It can clear up a lot of things.
Can you say anything about it?

826
01:37:41,336 --> 01:37:42,303
Speak up Renu.

827
01:37:45,173 --> 01:37:47,767
Yes, I recognise this lighter.

828
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:53,379
I gave it to him the day
he murdered my sister.

829
01:37:55,150 --> 01:37:57,311
Proof?
- Here's the proof.

830
01:37:57,652 --> 01:37:59,119
My name is engraved on it.

831
01:38:00,221 --> 01:38:03,054
"R' stands for Renu.
- "R' stands for Rekha. Rekha gave me.

832
01:38:03,224 --> 01:38:05,385
Yes, I gave it to him.
- You said you had bought it.

833
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:06,527
Yes, yes. I...

834
01:38:07,028 --> 01:38:09,724
You're forgetting you just
said you never knew her.

835
01:38:10,565 --> 01:38:14,001
Then how do you explain
love and presents?

836
01:38:14,169 --> 01:38:17,502
What do you mean to say?
- I'll explain to you.

837
01:38:18,106 --> 01:38:21,405
The story starting from now
traces Jagmohan's murder.

838
01:38:21,576 --> 01:38:24,136
This can bear another
interpretation.

839
01:38:25,313 --> 01:38:27,474
That you and Mrs. Jagmohan
have illicit affair.

840
01:38:27,582 --> 01:38:29,550
Inspector!
- Shut up and listen.

841
01:38:29,751 --> 01:38:34,745
Jagmohan suspected your
relations with Diwan.

842
01:38:35,256 --> 01:38:37,224
Unexpectedly he returned
last evening and...

843
01:38:37,392 --> 01:38:41,021
saw you and Diwan in a
compromising position...

844
01:38:41,196 --> 01:38:43,357
his suspicions were confirmed.

845
01:38:43,598 --> 01:38:46,158
Both got into a scuffle
and Jagmohan was killed.

846
01:38:46,334 --> 01:38:47,562
This is a lie.

847
01:38:48,636 --> 01:38:52,163
It wasn't dark then, Diwan,
which could cover your crime.

848
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:54,308
So the corpse was hidden
in the bathroom...

849
01:38:54,476 --> 01:38:59,379
with the idea of disposing
it off later.

850
01:38:59,581 --> 01:39:04,041
In the meantime the
unfortunate Dilip Rai came...

851
01:39:04,919 --> 01:39:09,379
who had escaped from the asylum with
the accusation of his wife's murder.

852
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:14,387
Nothing was easier than to
accuse him of Jagmohan's murder.

853
01:39:14,729 --> 01:39:19,530
Right. Then the corpse was thrown out
under the cover of darkness.

854
01:39:20,435 --> 01:39:25,805
But Diwan, you forget that a
murderer always leaves a clue.

855
01:39:26,307 --> 01:39:28,002
This air ticket is that proof.

856
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:31,001
This must have slipped out
of Jagmohan's pocket either...

857
01:39:31,112 --> 01:39:34,138
when his body was taken to the
bathroom or when taken out.

858
01:39:34,315 --> 01:39:38,479
Your story is the result
of your imagination.

859
01:39:38,653 --> 01:39:42,521
You are ignoring the evidence which
clearly proves Rai as the murderer.

860
01:39:42,690 --> 01:39:44,681
What is that?
- The badge of the lunatic asylum...

861
01:39:44,792 --> 01:39:46,692
which was found in the
hand of the corpse.

862
01:39:48,796 --> 01:39:54,428
Even this proclaims that the
murderer is not Rai, but someone else.

863
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:57,101
Please come here inspector.

864
01:40:01,042 --> 01:40:03,567
There is no blood
stains on the badge.

865
01:40:04,145 --> 01:40:05,942
Blood stains!
What do you mean?

866
01:40:06,481 --> 01:40:10,440
When a pin is pierced in the hand of
an alive man, blood spurts out.

867
01:40:12,053 --> 01:40:15,250
The whole pin of this badge
is in Jagmohan's hand.

868
01:40:18,226 --> 01:40:19,454
Yet there are
no blood stains.

869
01:40:21,095 --> 01:40:25,122
This means the badge was thrust
into his hand when he was dead.

870
01:40:26,201 --> 01:40:29,398
The badge was placed
after the murder.

871
01:40:30,438 --> 01:40:36,673
It was easy for them.
As Rai's clothes were here.

872
01:40:38,246 --> 01:40:43,479
It proves, that Mrs. Jagmohan
and Diwan did it.

873
01:40:43,651 --> 01:40:46,620
Beware! Whoever comes forward
shall be shot dead.

874
01:40:49,424 --> 01:40:52,825
It's not easy to catch
inspector Diwan, as you imagine.

875
01:40:53,027 --> 01:40:55,723
Whoever steps forward
shall be shot.

876
01:40:56,297 --> 01:40:59,289
Why do you point your pistol at them?
Punish me for my sins.

877
01:40:59,601 --> 01:41:02,229
It will be right if I'm killed
for my sins. I'm guilty.

878
01:41:02,403 --> 01:41:05,167
Kill me, why don't you shoot?

879
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:10,639
I asked you to shoot!
Yes, shoot me.

880
01:41:15,316 --> 01:41:18,513
You've disgraced
the police uniform.

881
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:21,511
I'll see that you're punished.

882
01:41:23,057 --> 01:41:24,183
Take him away.

883
01:41:35,303 --> 01:41:36,827
I commend your courage.

884
01:41:37,572 --> 01:41:40,268
Despite difficulties in
which you were involved...

885
01:41:40,441 --> 01:41:43,274
you have co-operated with
the law like a good citizen.

886
01:41:43,778 --> 01:41:46,338
If it were in my power
I would release you.

887
01:41:46,514 --> 01:41:49,540
How can you set him free?
He murdered my sister.

888
01:41:49,751 --> 01:41:53,278
No, he's not a murderer. Only
a victim of circumstances.

889
01:41:53,655 --> 01:41:56,419
The first murder took place...

890
01:41:56,591 --> 01:41:59,754
when he left the room
in which it happened.

891
01:42:00,361 --> 01:42:04,161
The other was committed
before he entered the room.

892
01:42:04,666 --> 01:42:08,295
And there were women behind
both the crimes.

893
01:42:08,603 --> 01:42:09,570
Women?

894
01:42:10,071 --> 01:42:13,734
Mrs. Jagmohan in the second
and you in the first.

895
01:42:13,941 --> 01:42:15,374
Me! What do you mean?

896
01:42:17,612 --> 01:42:20,240
Wasn't your sister very rich?
- Yes.

897
01:42:20,415 --> 01:42:22,576
If Rai was hanged
for your sister' murder...

898
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:25,048
who would have inherited
that wealth? You, isn't it?

899
01:42:25,219 --> 01:42:28,086
For this would I murder my sister?
- For that matter, you have done it.

900
01:42:28,323 --> 01:42:33,090
You've taken leave of your senses.
- Certainly not. But you were tempted.

901
01:42:33,361 --> 01:42:35,226
Your room faces Dilip Rai's.

902
01:42:35,396 --> 01:42:38,991
You were there, yet you
didn't save your sister.

903
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:41,168
I was scared.
- No way. You wanted to...

904
01:42:41,336 --> 01:42:43,998
take advantage of the situation. When
your sister and Dilip Rai quarrelled...

905
01:42:44,172 --> 01:42:47,903
he pushed her and went out. You went
into the room and stifled her.

906
01:42:48,076 --> 01:42:49,668
I never entered that room.

907
01:42:49,877 --> 01:42:53,369
You did go into that room.
You killed your sister.

908
01:42:53,581 --> 01:42:54,809
What nonsense!
- Shut up.

909
01:42:56,784 --> 01:42:59,014
Where are your pearls?
- Which pearls?

910
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:01,486
Those set in this bangle.
- Must have been lost.

911
01:43:01,656 --> 01:43:04,625
They have not been lost.
They're here with me. Look.

912
01:43:05,493 --> 01:43:08,519
When you were smothering your sister,
she was trying to free herself and...

913
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:11,756
the pearls fell
into Rai's colour palate.

914
01:43:14,202 --> 01:43:17,228
This is the last link and
conclusive proof of your murder.

915
01:43:17,772 --> 01:43:21,799
Miss Renu, I arrest you
for the murder of your sister.

916
01:43:24,812 --> 01:43:29,306
It appears in the end that
we're all mad except you.

917
01:43:29,917 --> 01:43:33,512
You were the only sane
person among us.

918
01:43:35,556 --> 01:43:37,387
It was by chance that...

919
01:43:37,592 --> 01:43:41,323
Renu killed her sister
and I was accused of it.

920
01:43:43,631 --> 01:43:47,431
I escaped the asylum and
came into this house. It was by chance.

921
01:43:47,969 --> 01:43:53,930
I was accused of Jagmohan's
murder by chance.

922
01:43:54,709 --> 01:43:58,839
But being declared innocent of
all this was not by chance.

923
01:43:59,847 --> 01:44:04,477
A dominating power always
distinguishes truth from false...

924
01:44:04,652 --> 01:44:07,621
and day from night, doctor.

925
01:44:27,608 --> 01:44:30,099
Rekha has atoned for her sins.

926
01:44:40,621 --> 01:44:44,387
Wish our conscience made us
aware of our crimes.

927
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:49,726
Life came to a standstill
and so did the people

928
01:44:49,964 --> 01:44:52,330
But time never waits.

929
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:56,131
Crime and punishment
will go on forever.

930
01:44:56,571 --> 01:45:00,337
Hope the convicts will be
saved from the judgement of man.

931
01:45:00,641 --> 01:45:04,133
But will never be saved
by the judgement of God.
