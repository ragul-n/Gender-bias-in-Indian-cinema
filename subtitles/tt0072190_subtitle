1
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,388
Listen, listen, are you listening?

2
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,351
Again, again...

3
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,160
Alas, what has happened to our child?

4
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,161
He's not sleeping and never smiles anymore.

5
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:58,239
Son, aren't you going to sleep tonight?
Everyone is sleeping, won't you?

6
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,050
I'm drawing pictures.

7
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,284
Ok, but draw them in the morning, you'll
catch cold at night.

8
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,367
I'm drawing a peacock.

9
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,338
I have seen a peacock before.

10
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,010
This is a camel. We used to have camels at
our house.

11
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:31,406
This is my house. I am standing in front of
my house.

12
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,221
This is a picture of a war. I have seen that
war.

13
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,427
And this is the golden fort.

14
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:49,033

23
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:46,177
Alright, when did you first notice this
problem?

24
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,213
Since the last two or three months.

25
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,820
Did you notice if this occurrence happens at
a specific time?

26
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,397
His mind is always somewhere else.

27
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:03,662
I can't seem to send him to school,
and his mind is never on his studies.

28
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,900
He's always thinking and drawing pictures
of where he claims he was born.

29
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:17,407
Have you seen these specific forts,
mountains, camels etc, of which he speaks?

30
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,411
I used to be there.

31
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:20,951
Do you remember when you were there?

32
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,991
And this war, bows, arrows and swords... did
you see all this?

33
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:33,957
I saw it.

34
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,663
Did you fight in the war yourself?

35
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,936
I was a child then.

36
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,835
And, when you grew up?

37
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,878
I have not grown up.

38
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,987
What was your father? A King?

39
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,387
The King was someone else.

40
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,157
So... your Dad?

41
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,799
I used to have a ring on my finger.

42
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,704
A ring, like this?

43
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:13,567
I have seen stones.

44
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,106
Stones? What kind of stones?

45
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,005
Red, blue, yellow... all kinds of them.

46
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,039
Were they expensive stones?
Did they shine and sparkle?

47
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,383
Yes, they did.

48
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,015
These are new things he's saying.

49
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,845
Where were these stones? At your house?

50
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,556
Yes.

51
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,782
Were you rich? Did you have a big house?

52
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,792
No, a small house.

53
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,962
Where were these stones kept? In a safe?

54
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,689
Or were they secretly underground?

55
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,494
I don't think he remembers everything.

56
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,038
Sometimes he remembers certain things
and he says them.

57
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,980
Is he ok with Dr. Hajra taking him
to Rajasthan?

58
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,079
Why don't you ask him?

59
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,019
Do you want to go with the Doctor
to Rajasthan?

60
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,347
I want to see the golden fort.

61
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:07,817
Doctor Uncle will show it to me.

62
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,171
Say cheese.

63
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,737
Why?

64
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,978
Smile... if you smile
the picture will be better.

65
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,543
I do not feel like smiling.

66
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:49,349
There is no doubt that
all of the precious

67
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:55,030
stones that Mukul speaks of
were secretly kept in his house.

68
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:12,848
Hello... Hello?!

69
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,658
Hold on Mister.

70
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,666
HELLO? HELLO?

71
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:22,756
This is Mr. Bose speaking.

72
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:23,831
What is this concerning?

73
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,594
Did you read the newspaper this morning?

74
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,668
Why?

75
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
You should read it.

76
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,739
What's in it?

77
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,673
On the last page, towards the end.

78
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:35,042
It's a good opportunity,
if we can invest wisely, we'll get rich.

79
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,213
Tell me in detail.

80
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,014
You read it, and I'll call you
after 10 minutes.

81
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,921
And listen, you should not shout like this,
it's a public telephone.

82
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,069
It's been 20 minutes already.

83
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,067
Hold on Mister. You should not be
impatient in this matter.

84
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,036
It's a golden opportunity.

85
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,070
Get out the picture... get it out.

86
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:18,050
Similar forehead... nose... hair.

87
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:24,907
Hey kid, turn your
face towards us more...

88
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:26,889
Darn it!

89
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,827
Mukul, look at that kite... there it is!

90
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,348
Could you tell us where 7 Jatindas Lane is?

91
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,052
7? That's the Phatik Family's house.

92
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,158
Could you show us where it is?

93
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,033
We're from Beluchisthan,
we're unfamiliar with Calcutta's streets.

94
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,801
Ok, Let's go.

95
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:19,981
Hello, does Prodosh Mitra live here?

96
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:22,788
Yes, do come in.

97
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,115
Please sit down.

98
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,325
He's here.

99
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,199
You have to wait
another three and a half minutes

100
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,589
What is this? Why are you in such a hurry?
Go slow, otherwise you'll choke!

101
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,096
You see? He did not finish his milk.

102
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,468
He thinks that Phelu's clients
are also his clients.

103
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,832
Does that make any sense? God knows what
these two are up to now.

104
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,145
Our family is filled
with adventurous people.

105
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,480
I've never seen you be adventurous.

106
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,333
I'm the black sheep of
the family... but think

107
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,616
of my two elder brothers.

108
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,286
The middle one could take out
baby foxes from their holes

109
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:34,352
with his bare hand... when
he was only 10.

110
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,589
It is not a surprise that his son, is Phelu.

111
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:43,063
But I'm worried about his schooling
and education.

112
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,004
Is there a teacher like Phelu
at that school, though?

113
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,652
Greetings, you are...?

114
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,049
Yes, please be seated.

115
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,294
My name is Sudeep Dhar.

116
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,858
I own a bookstore on College Street.

117
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,863
Kailash Chowdhury is a frequent buyer and
had good things to say about you.

118
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,268
He referred me your name.

119
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,598
On what matter?

120
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:28,943
The matter being... have you seen this
article?

121
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,512
Yes, I noticed... Is Mukul your...?

122
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,917
Yes, he's my youngest son.

123
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,290
He's very famous now. Is all of what he's
saying true?

124
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,323
Can he really remember his past life?

125
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,001
We don't understand it very much, but Dr.
Hajra says...

126
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,615
This Dr. Hajra... you mean,
Dr. H. Hajra the parapsychologist

127
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:54,061
who just came back from Canada?

128
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,499
We met at the store.

129
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,608
He has talked about going to Rajasthan?

130
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,076
Oh yes, they already left.

131
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,344
Left already?

132
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:07,009
They left yesterday morning by train,
staying over one day in Delhi.

133
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,575
Do you think they went to Jodhpur?

134
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,515
Yes, exactly!

135
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:17,119
Yes, Jodhpur is a possibility,
because it has forts and sand.

136
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,815
Yes, researching parapsychology
with Mukul along

137
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:26,832
one may come to know
about many things.

138
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,339
Well, since you're in
the book business,

139
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,337
you don't have any specific
picture books on Rajasthan?

140
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,182
It may be possible that by looking
at those picture books, your child is

141
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:40,651
imagining his drawing and making
up a story about a past life.

142
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:45,223
In a child's mind, they can have some
strange ways of imagining.

143
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,108
Yes, I understand all that.
But I cannot understand

144
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:48,291
why he draws pictures
in the middle of the night.

145
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,255
In the middle of the night?

146
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:57,490
Yes, even at 2 or 3 AM!
And the minute Dr. Hajra

147
00:13:57,491 --> 00:14:02,740
proposed to show him
the golden fort, he agreed!

148
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,732
The same little boy who
is so attached to his parents

149
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:10,276
in a second agreed
to go off with a stranger.

150
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,498
In fact, we're sad to say
that during the last couple months,

151
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:16,047
we do not even know
who he is anymore.

152
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:22,054
He did not used to be like this,
he was very normal.

153
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,856
Do you think he's not normal anymore?

154
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:31,348
No, no no! Our problem is different
... it has become so severe

155
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:34,003
that we've lost sleep over this.

156
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,940
Is that related to the treasure
he mentioned?

157
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:41,144
Yes, you're exactly right.
Printing it in the paper has made it worse.

158
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,115
He gave a statement to the paper
about the treasure though.

159
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:49,877
Yes, he did report the treasure
was in his own home.

160
00:14:49,878 --> 00:14:55,124
But the paintings of the houses
are very ordinary.

161
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,257
Ok, go on.

162
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:01,742
Another problem is that in our
neighbourhood there is another child

163
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:06,430
named Mukul who is my son's age
and he was kidnapped yesterday.

164
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,335
Inside the neighborhood?

165
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,344
Yes and they returned him just this morning.

166
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:22,544
So you're afraid that
they will kidnap the real Mukul.

167
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:23,883
Yes.

168
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,815
Did this other Mukul tell the kidnappers
where your son has gone?

169
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:35,063
I'm not sure. When they returned the child,
he was unconscious

170
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:40,862
and a newspaper boy recognized him
and notified his parents.

171
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,474
When I heard the news,

172
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:48,035
I came immediately to you.

173
00:15:56,588 --> 00:16:00,736
I know that this is probably outrageous
for an ordinary man like me

174
00:16:00,737 --> 00:16:03,328
to come to a person like you,

175
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,920
but if you're willing to go
there, I'll pay for your costs.

176
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,363
Do you have a telephone?

177
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,430
Yes, in my bookstore.

178
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,433
If you call me after 10:00 AM,
you can reach me.

179
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,279
Ok, I will let you know by this afternoon.

180
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,318
How can I thank you?

181
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,518
I haven't decided yet,
so don't say anything.

182
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,521
Even telling you my story makes me grateful.

183
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:46,597
Tufan Express will leave
from Platform 8 at 9:35 PM.

184
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,483
Ok, our names are listed...
Mr. M. Bose and A. N. Barman.

185
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,099
The study of parapsychology deals with

186
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,328
understanding the abstract
thinking of human mind.

187
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:19,212
Suppose, you are
thinking of an old friend

188
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:24,308
and immediately you receive
a phone call, and it's from him.

189
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,964
People will say it's an accident,

190
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:31,513
but a parapsychologist
would explain it as telepathy.

191
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:40,318
It is because of mental telepathy that your
friend has called you.

192
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,785
Understood?

193
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,286
Yes.

194
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:49,493
If you're thinking that we're going to
Rajasthan on this case,

195
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:53,133
and that you can get out of school
for this, you're wrong.

196
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,471
You will definitely take this case.

197
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,275
How do you know?

198
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,403
Telepathy.

199
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,345
Oh... smart aleck, do you even know how
much work there is?

200
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,597
First of all, we have to create
a small budget.

201
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:11,578
This guy isn't as rich
as Mr. Chowdhury was.

202
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,792
He's not well off like my other clients
who would write me

203
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,327
thousands of rupees
of checks in a second.

204
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,590
Probably, some money from my pocket
will go too.

205
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,362
You always say that money isn't everything.

206
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:31,032
It isn't, but to save a
6 year old boy like this,

207
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:38,149
some money has to be
invested in this matter.

208
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,313
I feel I have to bear the costs.

209
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:52,749
Costs include booking tickets,
changing trains,

210
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:58,159
overnight hotels, picking up
warm clothes from our laundry,

211
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:04,699
it's very cold there and
we also have to go to Sidhu Uncle's House.

212
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,203
Why?

213
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:13,681
I need information regarding
a person named Hemango Hajra.

214
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,817
10 years ago, he was involved
in some kind of mess.

215
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,389
In what matter?

216
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:27,261
I don't remember. That's why I need
to go to him for information.

217
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:53,472
In 1962, in Allahabad,
a man dressed up

218
00:19:53,473 --> 00:19:57,323
as a fake Swami
named Bhabhananda

219
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:05,233
and fooled many people
by hypnotizing them.

220
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:12,222
He opened up a false
business claiming to

221
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:17,606
cure any disease, exactly as it
happened in 18th century Europe.

222
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,584
Himango Hajra went to Allahabad
to visit them.

223
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:26,624
So he caught them in their false business?

224
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:31,661
Yes, as a result, Babhananda Swami fled
with his disciple immediately.

225
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,733
Now I remember.

226
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:39,666
Does this have anything to do with that kid,
Mukul Dhar?

227
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,470
Thank God you did not become a detective,
otherwise, I'd be out of a job.

228
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:52,413
If I wanted, I could have done many things.

229
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:00,408
I kept my mind open to
new possibilities

230
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:03,487
and that keeps me going.

231
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,569
You're meddling in

232
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,285
people's dark matters,

233
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:17,197
but you need to keep your spirits high.

234
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,205
I've also kept my mind open.

235
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:30,186
Who was William James Hirschle?

236
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:35,415
He was an English ICS officer
posted in Bengal.

237
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:41,134
In 1880, he was the first
to publish an article

238
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:44,696
in 'Nature' Journal about how criminals

239
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:47,800
could be caught with fingerprints.

240
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,079
Bravo, Bravo!

241
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,487
Give me your hand.

242
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:56,509
Live long and prosper,
my child.

243
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,495
How do you like this Fort, Mukul?

244
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:16,260
This is not my golden fort.

245
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,928
Do you know what this place is?

246
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,333
Delhi.

247
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:24,517
Do you remember the place where your

248
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:27,312
golden fort was? Try to remember.

249
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,382
No, I don't remember.

250
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,511
Come here, child.

251
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:44,230
They have all come to
meet with you... they

252
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:48,327
are good people. Look what
they have brought for you.

253
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:52,230
Since you are so brave,
I'm giving you this gift.

254
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,466
Great, look what's in here... a pistol.

255
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,539
Be careful, there are bullets inside.

256
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,485
Are you happy?

257
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:13,581
Now, tell them what
they have come here to ask you.

258
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,490
Well, I'll tell you what happened.

259
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,634
Last night, he was playing in the
neighboring alley

260
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:26,938
and went to get the ball
used in his slingshot.

261
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,533
Neelu, my friend, told me to get it.

262
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:29,636
Yes, Neelu said...

263
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,065
Where was Neelu?

264
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,177
On the roof.

265
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,570
He called you by your name?

266
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,204
Yes.

267
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:42,180
Yes, after that, a car came nearby him.

268
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,220
Taxi?

269
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,586
No, a plain car... black.

270
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,623
Two men came out of the car, and told him
to point out a house.

271
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,253
The Phatik's house.

272
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,423
How did the two men look?

273
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,534
They had beards.

274
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,230
Both of them?

275
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,198
Yes... and they said they came from
Beluchistan.

276
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,339
Lies... all lies.

277
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,306
Then?

278
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:10,537
They covered my eyes and mouth
and took me to a house.

279
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,185
Then they asked,
"Where is the golden fort?"

280
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,585
I told them, I did not know, but Mukul does.

281
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,523
Then they asked me what my name was.

282
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,520
I told them my name was Mukul too.

283
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,162
Then they said "mistake, mistake".

284
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:35,172
After that, they asked where
the other Mukul was.

285
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,936
I said that he had gone away.

286
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,443
They asked "where?"

287
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,245
I told them "Jaipur".

288
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,672
You told them Jaipur?

289
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,251
No, no, Jodhpur.

290
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:53,290
After that, they gave me a glass of milk.

291
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,620
I told them that I do not drink milk.

292
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,558
Then they forcefully opened my mouth and
fed it to me.

293
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:04,224
After that, I started feeling sleepy.

294
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,602
Do you see why we are fearful?

295
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:16,872
Here you go, this is
Dr. Hajra's business card.

296
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,077
I have written two lines on the back of it.

297
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,579
Great, that is a wise decision...
and telegram?

298
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:28,652
That has all been
arranged... when you reach

299
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:31,584
there, send me a telegram.

300
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,522
Certainly.

301
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:41,308
"Arriving Jodhpur on the 11th,
to ensure

302
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:47,241
Mukul's safety against
possible criminal activity".

303
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:50,847
Great.

304
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,610
Additionally, I added a "Regards" as well.

305
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,489
It is not what you are thinking.

306
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,361
Mukul, do you want to eat something?

307
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,188
I have your food with me.

308
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,761
I eat bread.

309
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:57,964
Bread?

310
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,563
Round and thick.

311
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,203
Do you eat them now,
or did you use to eat it?

312
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,506
I used to.

313
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,677
Who used to make them? Your mother?

314
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,385
Heh Heh!

315
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:28,661
You rolled a 5, how did you climb the
ladder?

316
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,430
What do you mean 5? I thought it was a 4.

317
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,436
Do my eyes have cataracts now?

318
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:41,139
No, you've drank too much, fix that instead.

319
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,444
Now slide back down again.

320
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,741
Ok.

321
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,416
Tell me Mukul, did you used to have treasure
at your house?

322
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,383
Treasure?

323
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:55,625
You told the reporters that you had hidden
treasure at your house.

324
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,055
No I didn't.

325
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,396
You didn't say that?

326
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,757
Your house did not have red, blue etc
stones?

327
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:06,403
Yes there was. My father used to break
stones.

328
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:08,561
You mean carve stones that would be used
to create jewelry?

329
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:09,571
Yes.

330
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:17,604
Oh I see. A jewelry maker... a gem cutter.

331
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,020
I'm going outside to the corridor.

332
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,527
Go ahead.

333
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:39,667
It's over now, you've been gulped by the
snake. What happened?

334
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,535
I'll be right back.

335
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,605
Ok, just don't be late,
we have to play Ludo.

336
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:51,477
Excuse me.

337
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:00,611
Mukul?

338
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,580
Start your trick now!

339
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,028
Mukul, would you like
to see a magic trick?

340
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:14,894
What magic?

341
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:20,836
Watch...

342
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:23,604
Vanish!

343
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:35,811
I have more... watch again.

344
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,593
You're going to see the golden fort,
I presume?

345
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,124
Yes.

346
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:51,900
Your fort is in Jodhpur, right?

347
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:53,598
I don't know.

348
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,298
He doesn't know.

349
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,298
Expensive stones?

350
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,269
Diamonds, rubies, emeralds?

351
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,413
What's in that bottle?

352
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,246
A shake made of cane sugar,
have you ever tasted it?

353
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,443
I'm going now.

354
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,449
I'll accompany you back.

355
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,300
Where did he go?

356
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,268
Who?

357
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,361
The man who showed me a magic trick.

358
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,563
Wow, in this short time, you saw a magic
trick?

359
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,436
Sit down, now you have to eat.

360
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,300
Oh no!

361
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,240
What happened?

362
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,313
This is that same Hajra that we know.

363
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:39,614
So what?

364
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:44,452
One more glance and he could have
recognised me.

365
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:45,283
So? That was a long time ago!

366
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:50,247
Back in 1962, we had
long beards and longer hair.

367
00:33:50,248 --> 00:33:52,521
I was even wearing a big apron.

368
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:58,261
Oh... I didn't even think about that!

369
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,366
Of course you didn't!

370
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:04,534
We have to soon get this boy
into our grasp,

371
00:34:04,535 --> 00:34:07,305
and then we'll get rid of Hajra!

372
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,099
Yes! He's harassing us too much!

373
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,291
Do you know how many
different businesses

374
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:14,317
I've had to change in the past
10 years because of that man?

375
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:16,510
Yes, yes! At least a couple of hundred.

376
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,452
I don't even have two to three suits!

377
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:25,451
At least you have your own. Everything
I wear is someone else's.

378
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,374
So give it to me.

379
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:41,803
What?

380
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,482
We can't go into a war without weapons.

381
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:52,486
I'm the one that has to do the job.

382
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,554
Who said that you have to kill him with a
gun?

383
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,561
First go and become his friend. That is your
first duty

384
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,591
Hold on!

385
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,333
Did you figure out how you will introduce
yourself?

386
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,335
You don't have to think of those things.

387
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,407
I got a 55 on the Metric Examination.

388
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:11,507
In what subject?

389
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,509
Geography.

390
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:39,634
Here. Look here.
It is better this way.

391
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:44,670
How do you like it?

392
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:50,345
You are not only smart in geographical
issues but also in magic.

393
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,941
I learned all this abroad.

394
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,411
Did you take all of your magic tricks with
you?

395
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,983
There isn't a shortage of children in the
world. I'm only glad to make children happy.

396
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,795
You are going to Jodhpur, right?

397
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,868
There's a fort on the way first...
we'll see that, and then go there.

398
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,297
The golden fort?

399
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,793
It could be...

400
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,133
Where is that again?

401
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,802
Jaipur City... Nahargar fort.

402
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:23,886
I see. In my train compartment
there is a man, Mr. Bagchi,

403
00:36:23,887 --> 00:36:25,975
who is researching about forts.

404
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:28,812
He was mentioning that name.

405
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:32,888
We'll reach Jaipur at 7:30, and after we see
the fort, we'll leave in the evening.

406
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,249
I see.

407
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:52,841
Porter!

408
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,707
We should leave our things at the station.

409
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,815
We couldn't carry our luggage on our backs
on that long climb

410
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,855
Let's go, Porter.

411
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:19,729
Topshe, eat this sweet.

412
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:23,005
The train is delayed and will be arriving
late in Kanpur.

413
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,981
Beautiful scenery!

414
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,052
I'm worried.

415
00:38:03,653 --> 00:38:06,435
Those people perhaps could

416
00:38:06,436 --> 00:38:09,645
be on the same train as Mukul.

417
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:14,590
They won't do anything to him though.

418
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:20,024
They won't do anything now, because Mukul
is their key to the treasure.

419
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,024
And Dr. Hajra?

420
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:28,376
The same people that
kidnapped a 7 year old kid

421
00:38:28,377 --> 00:38:31,602
and left him unconscious
by the side of a road,

422
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:38,638
won't show mercy on
a 50 year old professor.

423
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:47,621
Go ahead, sir. What's wrong?

424
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:48,959
There's something stuck in my shoe.

425
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,663
There isn't a train until the evening.

426
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,317
Did you notice something?

427
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,251
What?

428
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,219
There's another fort.

429
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:17,683
Where?

430
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:18,922
Look over there.

431
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,056
Way over there!

432
00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:26,887
Take out your binoculars to see it.

433
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:34,530
This isn't the golden fort! This is another
fort.

434
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,910
I agree. Let's leave immediately.
We have to see even more forts

435
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,007
Where is he?

436
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,006
Who?

437
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:47,007
Doctor Uncle?

438
00:39:47,008 --> 00:39:48,018
Vanish!

439
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:18,946
Did you do a magic trick?

440
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,409
Yes! Magic!

441
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:22,647
He won't come back?

442
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:28,948
Crazy! He got scared that the camels here
would kick him!

443
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,927
He's a very irresponsible man!

444
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,694
Then who will show me the golden fort?

445
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,562
Why? We'll show you.
Here's the new Dr. Hajra.

446
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,939
Dr. Hajra come and meet Mukul!

447
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:44,930
He is also Dr. Hajra?

448
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,936
Yes, yes. There are hundreds of Dr. Hajra's.

449
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,713
I know another Mukul too.

450
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,953
That's great!

451
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:16,962
Kanpur.

452
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:25,971
Breakfast.

453
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:29,975
Come here.

454
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:35,948
Be careful, it's imported! Put it here.

455
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,457
Put the luggage under the bench.

456
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:04,043
Don't whine, this is enough! Go, go!

457
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:22,929
How far are you both going?

458
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:26,932
Jodhpur.

459
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,980
I am also going there.

460
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:37,010
I want to write a story on Jodhpur.

461
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,013
Something adventurous.

462
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:48,521
Up to date, I have written 27 adventure
novels.

463
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,025
All of them published.

464
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:06,006
Here you go, this is my latest one.

465
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:11,656
It is based on characters
who live in the Gobi Desert:

466
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:13,021
"Daring Villains"

467
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:14,821
Are you Jatayu?

468
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,014
That's my literary name.

469
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:23,033
My real name is Lal Mohan Ganguly.

470
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:29,504
When the evil Ravan kidnapped Sita,

471
00:43:29,505 --> 00:43:34,039
the bird Jatayu came to her rescue.

472
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:38,037
That's why I use this name.

473
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:42,747
Do you know how to speak Bengali?

474
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,019
Yes I do, and I know how to speak it too.

475
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,045
Where did you learn?

476
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:49,526
Calcutta.

477
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,030
You can carry on with your Hindi,
it's quite fine.

478
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:59,661
Darn it, sir!
I'm originally from Garpar, Calcutta.

479
00:43:59,662 --> 00:44:01,400
Do you think I want
to speak Hindi like this?

480
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:07,037
Look at this! I have a Bengali to Hindi
Dictionary too!

481
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:10,809
It seems like you've been traveling a lot?

482
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,378
Yes, since December 15th.

483
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:19,045
I can tell by the colour of your skin
underneath your watchband.

484
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:27,830
Watch? Wow! You just acted like a
well-trained detective.

485
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:29,054
Do you read fictional detective novels?

486
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:30,829
My nephew reads them.

487
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,057
Oh, really?

488
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,061
Yes, I've read many of your books.

489
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:36,472
Oh really? Name them.

490
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:46,072
Very good! This is my latest publication.

491
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:50,076
Here, let me autograph it for you...
what's your name?

492
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:51,687
Topeshranjan Mitra.

493
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:06,059
So, sir, let me take down your name and
address since we just met.

494
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:13,065
Prodosh Mitra. 21, Rajani Sen Road,
Calcutta 70029.

495
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,075
Prodosh Mitra?

496
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:27,080
Aren't you a renowned swimmer?
Crossed the English Channel?

497
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:28,591
No, only Dhakuria Lake.

498
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,597
Why are you going to Jodhpur? A vacation?

499
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:36,599
Something like that.

500
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:40,603
Your face reminds me of my stories' hero.

501
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:42,638
Like Mr. Rudra?

502
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,608
Yes, yes... correct.

503
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,832
Height: 6 feet. Chest: 46 inches.
Waist: 32 inches.

504
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:53,572
Shoulder: 22 inches. Wrist:
8 and a half inches. Does it match?

505
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:55,607
Nope

506
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,281
No? What is your chest size?

507
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,622
Only 26 inches.

508
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:02,617
Waist?

509
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:03,626
Same.

510
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:08,597
Are you a pig?
Your body has no shape then?

511
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,622
Is there a Doctor here?

512
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,629
How much do you know about the Araballi
Mountain Range?

513
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,565
The length is 300 miles.
Height of Mount Abu is 550 feet

514
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:46,333
and there are very
few trees and only rocks and sand.

515
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,132
I'm not talking about that.

516
00:46:49,133 --> 00:46:52,232
I'm asking about the robbers there.

517
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,644
I heard that too.

518
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,648
My next novel will be based on that.
What do you think?

519
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,613
Write a novel if you want,
but don't get in too deep.

520
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:03,147
Really?

521
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:04,619
Definitely.

522
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,650
Even if I have this?

523
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:23,640
This is for self-protection.
I bought it in Nepal.

524
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,413
Do you know how these robbers
punish their enemies?

525
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,654
Chop off their heads?

526
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,657
No, they cut off the nose.

527
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:41,654
Nose?

528
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,660
I'll have to write about this then!

529
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,667
But this weapon is really something, huh?

530
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:57,671
Just ask me how much it costs.

531
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,672
50 rupees and 75 paisa.

532
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,685
The money label is still on the handle
of the souvenir.

533
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,658
You have amazing eyes! I'm impressed.

534
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,058
Would you like to take me
on your adventure?

535
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:20,593
Can you ride on a camel?

536
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,496
Camel? I have to ride a camel?

537
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,064
Probably.

538
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,066
Oh my!

539
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:31,386
The camel is a surprising animal, huh?

540
00:48:31,387 --> 00:48:35,280
It carries its own water
supply in the stomach

541
00:48:35,281 --> 00:48:38,842
and travels miles after
miles in the desert.

542
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:41,581
I already gave that information in my book.

543
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:42,916
Did you read that?

544
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,085
Yes, I did in "Adventures in the Sahara".

545
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,578
Correct.

546
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,090
Did you write that they carry water in their
stomach?

547
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,886
Yes, this is my 6th edition.

548
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,092
For the 7th edition, you should correct it.

549
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,093
What?

550
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:57,805
A camel gets its supply
of water by oxidizing

551
00:48:57,806 --> 00:49:01,069
the fat from its hump,
not from the stomach.

552
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:16,116
Give thanks to god
that you did not break any bones.

553
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,533
Now just rest...

554
00:49:19,534 --> 00:49:24,092
I'll send you food from my home.

555
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:29,096
The child is in danger, Doctor.

556
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,097
How can I rest now?

557
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,101
Don't you know anyone in Jodhpur?

558
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,103
No.

559
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:44,111
Once you get to Jodhpur, inform the police
immediately.

560
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:50,115
The main problem is my passport, ID,

561
00:49:50,116 --> 00:49:53,121
everything is in my suitcase.

562
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:32,124
Circuit House.

563
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,125
Huh?

564
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:34,126
We have a reservation at Circuit House.

565
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,127
Oh I see.

566
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,134
You need new clothes too.

567
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,137
Could you please give me a local outfit?

568
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,139
You want to wear a Rajasthani outfit?

569
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:52,145
It will help me disguise myself.

570
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:56,148
Hey. Help me to move this down.

571
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:04,124
Are you pocketing all the money for
yourself?

572
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,125
Be quiet! The money is all with him, there's
nothing here.

573
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:11,165
Stop dawdling. We have much work to do.
I have to do some serious reading.

574
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:15,169
Oh I see, I don't get any rewards
for this hard work?

575
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:24,143
Mukul, what are you singing?

576
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:38,252
Please sign here, Doctor.

577
00:51:38,253 --> 00:51:44,166
This telegram is for you.

578
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,174
Mukul, let's go.

579
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,177
Are we in the same room?

580
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,178
Yes.

581
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:00,180
You have reservations for Mr. Barman and
Mr. Bose, right?

582
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:04,185
Mr. Barman has thrombosis,
he could not come.

583
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,193
Doctor Uncle did not come?

584
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,165
Send me some tea in my room.

585
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:37,183
Dr. Hajra!

586
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:40,317
Here, look at this.

587
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:50,196
Is this arrival news
of the child's bodyguard?

588
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:55,202
Bodyguard, Detective, Gecko, whatever.
Or Private Investigator?

589
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,204
Prodosh Mitra... do you know him?

590
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:03,210
That's not the question. The question is
whether Dr. Hajra knows him.

591
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,212
Then you'll be caught.

592
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,215
Do we have any other alternatives?

593
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,219
And if he doesn't know him?

594
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,220
We're more or less safe.

595
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,021
Still, there will be a chance
of getting caught.

596
00:53:16,022 --> 00:53:17,223
Yes, there is.

597
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,228
The 11th? That means today.

598
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:27,234
Since they didn't come this morning.

599
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,202
This evening...

600
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:39,212
Let's see who gets eaten. The Scorpion or
the Gecko?

601
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,212
What are you thinking?

602
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,215
I have an empty bottle in my room.

603
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,217
Are you planning to catch this scorpion?

604
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,221
You'll catch it.

605
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:55,928
Do you know how dangerous it is?

606
00:53:57,367 --> 00:54:01,235
Do you want to share half of the property we
get or not?

607
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,237
Ok, give me the bottle.

608
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:22,255
Thank you very much, Doctor.

609
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,813
Do exactly as I told you,

610
00:54:25,814 --> 00:54:30,265
take care of yourself
and I wish you good luck.

611
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:32,265
Thank you, Doctor.

612
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:42,276
Wonderful tea!

613
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:45,244
The tea is ordinary, but the milk is exotic,
probably from a camel.

614
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,246
Camel? Amazing animal!

615
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:10,297
Highly suspicious.

616
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,301
Taxi, sir?

617
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:16,302
Yes, Circuit House.

618
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:18,304
Pick up the luggage.

619
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:20,306
Let's go, we'll drop you off.

620
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:21,307
Ok, but we have to share the price.

621
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:22,441
Sure.

622
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,309
Be careful with the luggage.

623
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:54,306
Please sign here.

624
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:57,309
Dr. Hajra.

625
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,313
What room is Dr. Hajra in?

626
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:02,314
Number one.

627
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:03,315
Where is that room?

628
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,318
The door behind you.

629
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:12,325
For the sir, room number three.

630
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:15,990
Should I go with him?

631
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,228
Yes, and take this.

632
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,597
Are you Bengali?

633
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:28,835
You too?

634
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:31,344
Someone else is Bengali.
He is a witch doctor.

635
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,345
A specialist in past-life experiences.

636
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,282
Do you have a child with you?

637
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:43,355
He says he's 750 years old.

638
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,016
I need to speak to him.

639
00:57:45,017 --> 00:57:46,260
He's in room number one.

640
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:56,369
Greetings. Are you Dr. Hajra?

641
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:57,970
Yes.

642
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,372
Did you receive the telegram
from Mr. Sudhir?

643
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,033
But you are?

644
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:03,375
I am Prodosh Mitra. Here's my card.

645
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,640
I see.

646
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,346
And this is a letter from Mr. Sudhir.

647
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,245
What is the matter?

648
00:58:12,246 --> 00:58:15,354
I'll tell you. Before that, let me acquaint
myself with Mr. Mukul.

649
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:19,358
Look, your two friends are here.

650
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,362
I'm Phelu and this is Topshe.

651
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:25,362
What are you drawing, Mukul?

652
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:29,767
The golden fort.

653
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:33,371
Come, sit down.

654
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:47,388
Come on my dear scorpion.

655
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,363
You haven't noticed anything out of the
ordinary?

656
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:07,374
No, not really. I did not know
in this detail about the child.

657
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,377
It's ok, I'm here.

658
00:59:09,378 --> 00:59:12,413
If anything strange
happens, let me know.

659
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,415
It is my main responsibility.

660
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,616
So you were in Allahabad?

661
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,383
I heard how you captured
that fake Swami there.

662
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,390
It's a long story.

663
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:26,394
Did you go out today?

664
00:59:26,395 --> 00:59:31,398
I took him to see another fort today but he
didn't want to get out of the car even.

665
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,399
I see you have some sand in your shoes.

666
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:35,696
Nahargarh.

667
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:37,998
What is Nahargarh?

668
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,405
There was sand at Nahargarh.

669
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,404
Nahargarh? The Fort near Jaipur?

670
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:48,416
Since we had to come through Jaipur,
we decided to show him a Fort there.

671
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:49,448
Then you changed trains to go there?

672
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:53,420
Yes, we went in the morning, and in the
evening came back.

673
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:54,622
Vanish.

674
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:55,983
Vanish?

675
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:58,023
The bad guy vanished.

676
00:59:58,528 --> 00:59:59,426
Which bad guy, Mukul?

677
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,429
The bad guy who is afraid of camels.

678
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:05,432
And you? You get scared
looking at camels too.

679
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:09,436
I've ridden on camels though.
At my house we had camels.

680
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:20,407
I'm not sure when he transitions from his
past life to present

681
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:22,415
What's your plan tomorrow?

682
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:26,419
We're going to Bekaner fort.
That's my only duty.

683
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,421
Ok, we'll accompany you.

684
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:31,424
Can I borrow this parapsychology journal?

685
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:32,917
Sure.

686
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,225
Let's go, Topshe.

687
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:41,434
One more thing, who is the other Bengali
person in this Circuit House?

688
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:46,439
You, Mukul, and I,
and Mr. Bose, the globetrotter

689
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,442
Oh, you mean the person we met outside?
He's a globetrotter?

690
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:51,444
Yes.

691
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:54,447
Interesting, I'll see you later.

692
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,423
Serious, isn't he?

693
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:14,460
You're talking about Mukul?

694
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:16,466
Yes, he didn't talk to me at all.

695
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,474
He's not in a normal state of mind.

696
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:26,437
He's in a confused state.

697
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:36,139
As long as he's in this
mind frame,

698
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:40,461
it will be hard
to understand him.

699
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:47,038
Leaving his family behind,

700
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:50,163
1400 miles apart...

701
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:55,030
and with a complete stranger

702
01:01:55,031 --> 01:01:59,781
searching for his golden fort.

703
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,922
Why does he speak of this fort so much?
Is it really made of gold?

704
01:02:10,593 --> 01:02:12,424
I don't think anything exists like that.

705
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:14,793
Then?

706
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,430
We have to think cleverly about this.

707
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:23,251
As people state,
"golden boy"

708
01:02:23,252 --> 01:02:27,408
or "golden Bengal"
or "golden crops".

709
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,876
Are they all made of real gold though?

710
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:55,567
Those people didn't come here yet.

711
01:02:56,739 --> 01:03:00,074
Perhaps they didn't
get a train reservation

712
01:03:00,075 --> 01:03:02,575
or they are staying somewhere else.

713
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:05,577
What if they don't come at all?

714
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:07,579
We're free from worries.

715
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:09,582
Brother!

716
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:14,920
Call the attendee.

717
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:21,956
Topshe, come and see.
You won't see such a

718
01:03:21,957 --> 01:03:24,598
dangerous creature from
a close range like this again.

719
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,605
Look at the hook on its tail.

720
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:33,606
What if it bites?

721
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:40,580
Extremely poisonous. Children or elders can
die. Younger people become half-dead.

722
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:45,584
Get the door.

723
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:49,588
How did this get into the room?

724
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,589
I'm not sure.

725
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,595
Make sure this is gone
and bring me a clean glass, please.

726
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:59,598
What happened? I heard some noise here.

727
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:01,600
Look at this.

728
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:05,604
Oh my god! It's a scorpion!

729
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:07,606
Yes, pure Indian scorpion.

730
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,611
Wow. And you're here on vacation right?

731
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,058
It looks like the start

732
01:04:16,059 --> 01:04:19,421
of your vacation is not auspicious.

733
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:21,620
Sit down, sir.

734
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:22,621
Ok.

735
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:27,592
So you're a globetrotter?

736
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:28,593
You already know about me?

737
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:51,616
Which places have you been?

738
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:58,624
Which places have I been?
Where haven't I been is the question.

739
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:02,603
I left home at age 16,
and since last October,

740
01:05:02,604 --> 01:05:04,633
after 26 years I've been home.

741
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:07,632
I'm surprised your Bengali accent hasn't
changed much though.

742
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:16,938
You can lose your Bengali accent in three
months if you wanted... However,

743
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:20,840
if you wanted to keep it,
it could last the rest of your life.

744
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:25,743
I have connections with Bengalis

745
01:05:25,744 --> 01:05:31,659
since I used to trade in ivory
in Kenya with one Bengali partner.

746
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,704
You are going to Bekaner tomorrow, right?

747
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:53,706
Why don't you come with us?

748
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,682
If there's a big group, then I can go.
Are you coming to dinner?

749
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,683
Yes, definitely.

750
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:10,724
I'll see you then.
Now let's see whether my room is safe.

751
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,701
The person who has returned to India after
26 years. Did you see his shoe brand?

752
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:22,701
Isn't that from Indian 'Bata' company?

753
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:24,068
Yes, of course.

754
01:07:24,069 --> 01:07:26,899
I wouldn't be surprised if his jacket
is from the street stores of Calcutta.

755
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:28,173
What do you mean?

756
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,876
We have to keep an eye on him.

757
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,746
Topshe, get out the torch.

758
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:36,374
The problems start here, Topshe.

759
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:12,978
Good morning.

760
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:13,979
Good morning.

761
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:18,984
Are you still ok?

762
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:19,985
Nothing has happened, yet.

763
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:24,956
Good morning, sir.

764
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:25,957
Good morning.

765
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:26,958
The taxi is ready for you, sir

766
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:28,960
Good. Send this telegram by express mail.

767
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:35,876
Let's see what you're carrying.

768
01:09:35,877 --> 01:09:38,972
Ok, go put it in the car.

769
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:01,994
Good morning!

770
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:02,995
Good morning

771
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:07,999
Is this your disguise?

772
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,391
Great place this is...

773
01:10:12,392 --> 01:10:15,975
I challenged the hotel manager
to a game and he refused to play.

774
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:17,976
Lucked out, huh?

775
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:19,804
What?

776
01:10:19,805 --> 01:10:20,977
Not, you... him.

777
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:22,979
Let me introduce you.

778
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:26,368
This is the renowned mystery author,

779
01:10:26,369 --> 01:10:27,987
Lal Mohan Ganguly and this
Mr. Bose, globetrotter.

780
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:35,096
Wow. I have to get to know you better.

781
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:37,996
I bet you've had many exciting experiences
in your life.

782
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:43,002
Except for being the victim of a
cannibal, everything else...

783
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:44,730
Ready?

784
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:48,006
Are we going to see the golden fort today?

785
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:49,307
Yes, Mukul.

786
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:53,011
What is that by your ear?

787
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:54,012
This is a new style.

788
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:55,013
Really?

789
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:56,014
You didn't know?

790
01:10:57,186 --> 01:11:00,019
Let's go then. Mr. Ganguly and Mr. Bose go
in the same car.

791
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:02,020
Jodhpur, right?

792
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,023
Not Jodhpur, Bekaner.

793
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,025
Bekaner? That's...

794
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:08,993
That's where the Fort is.

795
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:10,028
Wow.

796
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:13,031
We'll share the taxi fare,
otherwise I won't go.

797
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:15,033
Ok, sit down.

798
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:19,038
I'd like to buy something at the store to
protect my head.

799
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:38,023
Get me a toothbrush.

800
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:50,034
Yes, yes.

801
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:54,038
I have the same problem as Mr. Bose.

802
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:56,041
What?

803
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:57,042
I have to get something to protect my head.

804
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:01,046
Give me that blue one.

805
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:11,055
Why are you here?

806
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:14,627
I need something for the 300 mile trip too.

807
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:15,988
300 miles?

808
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:17,357
Bekaner is 300 miles.

809
01:12:17,358 --> 01:12:18,363
Oh, I see.

810
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:21,032
What is the total?

811
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:26,337
Have you ever been to Kathmandu?

812
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:29,274
Have you ever been to Kamchatka?

813
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:32,411
I'd like to show you something.

814
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:35,080
Tell me what it is,
since you'd be able to know it.

815
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:42,053
This is an unsafety razor.

816
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:45,056
King Jung Bahadur gave it to me.

817
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:49,061
Wow. I can understand after looking at this
rusted weapon.

818
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:50,061
What did you do with it?

819
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:55,067
Well, sir. Don't you think I should carry
some protection in Rajasthan?

820
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:59,071
Which fighters did you fight with?

821
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:05,077
Driver, are there robbers in Rajasthan?

822
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:06,077
Yes there are, sir.

823
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:07,078
See?

824
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,082
So you want to have some bloodshed in
Rajasthan?

825
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,689
What? No, no!

826
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:17,471
But that would be a good

827
01:13:17,472 --> 01:13:21,095
title for my next book.

828
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,097
"Bloodshed in Rajashtan"

829
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:29,100
I used a dagger like this to kill a wolf.

830
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,104
Where?

831
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:36,075
Tanganika. It was a dense forest
and I was alone.

832
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,077
Tanganika?

833
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,079
Yes, it's in Africa.
You've never heard of it?

834
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,084
I have a novel on Africa.
"Scare in Sahara".

835
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:46,687
That Africa.

836
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:47,678
Then...

837
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:49,915
Hyena?

838
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:55,088
I'm saying, that instead of a wolf,
did you kill a hyena?

839
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:59,097
Hyenas are in China.

840
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:02,100
I killed that wolf myself, and you're
telling me otherwise... Hmph!

841
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:04,103
There aren't wolves in Africa.

842
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,107
There aren't? Have you been there?

843
01:14:09,108 --> 01:14:10,269
No. I never went there.

844
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:11,434
Then how would you know?

845
01:14:11,435 --> 01:14:12,611
There are wolf preserves in Africa.

846
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:27,123
Did you see that type of cactus plant?
Look at that.

847
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:31,730
Every Saturday, this type of cactus
blossoms with flowers.

848
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,486
You do not know things
about your own country,

849
01:14:35,487 --> 01:14:36,669
and here you're arguing
about Africa. Hmph!

850
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:43,141
Are you a parapsychologist?

851
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:49,115
Did you say something?

852
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,650
You must be going to sleep
very late in the night.

853
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:55,120
I have to stay up late writing notes,
that's why.

854
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:03,129
Well, in your field of parapsychology, the
use of hypnotism is very interesting.

855
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,133
So, can new theories really emerge through
hypnotism?

856
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:10,135
That's what they say.

857
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:13,166
Do you know hypnotism?

858
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:15,140
No, do you?

859
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:17,133
Look! A peacock! A peacock!

860
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:45,136
What's the matter? You're not getting out?

861
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:47,138
I have this thing with peacocks...

862
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:48,633
Allergies?

863
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:55,180
Look at this scar. I was at the zoo
holding on to a peacock cage

864
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:57,081
It bit you?

865
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:58,186
Yes, 40 years ago.

866
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:03,154
Wow. National birds.

867
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:13,158
There's one thing I should warn you about.

868
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:20,167
That globetrotter is very suspicious;
you should keep an eye on him.

869
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:26,177
I see. Good thing you
brought it up... Mukul!

870
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:43,195
Why do you keep showing me the wrong
Fort?

871
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:56,644
Mukul, if you would
have told us the name

872
01:16:56,645 --> 01:17:00,179
of the place, we would have
immediately taken you there.

873
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:01,838
I'm hungry now.

874
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:05,183
I kept telling you to eat, and you did not.

875
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:07,185
What's wrong? Is he sick?

876
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:09,187
No, he's very sad.

877
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:10,787
Why?

878
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:12,223
He cannot find his golden fort.

879
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:15,186
Golden fort?

880
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:18,196
You all go look at it. I'll go and feed him.

881
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:21,159
Let's go. I'll tell you
everything while at the fort.

882
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,201
I'll make everything
clear for you on this matter.

883
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:26,601
Let's go, Mr. Bose.

884
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:29,207
You go on ahead. I have to go to the
bathroom.

885
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:45,224
It's as if every road they found, they've
mapped out a fort at each one.

886
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:48,193
How much longer do you want to get
duped? Money is running out.

887
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:51,825
What are you doing?

888
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:53,826
Why are they suspicious about you?

889
01:17:53,837 --> 01:17:54,824
Who?

890
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,235
The detective.

891
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:57,736
I did not make any mistakes in front of him.

892
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,097
Then where?

893
01:17:59,098 --> 01:18:00,439
I didn't know that there were not wolves in
Africa.

894
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,542
Ok, from now on I'll take care of it.
You don't have to worry.

895
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:05,612
We can't waste more time.

896
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:09,214
I understand that. How are you going to
hurry this?

897
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:16,918
There's a way.

898
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:22,227
If I can bring back his
past life experiences with hypnotism.

899
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:24,396
Do you know how to do that?

900
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:30,232
I haven't done it for many years.

901
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:32,540
Don't think about that.
It's like riding a bicycle.

902
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,239
Once you learn, you
can never forget how to ride it.

903
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:37,242
Do it tonight. Now, I'll manage the others.

904
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:54,496
Wow. I never thought
I would meet someone who knew

905
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:58,765
of their past life... and
that other man is a parapsychologist?

906
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:00,765
He's well-renowned.

907
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,334
You can't tell that by looking at him

908
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,323
Could anyone tell by looking
at you, that you're

909
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:08,240
a renowned adventure
genre fiction writer?

910
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:13,779
You are just like the detective character
I write about.

911
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:20,786
Another thing... Highly suspicious.
That man was saying...

912
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:23,584
I was wondering where you were.
How did you like my surprise?

913
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:25,156
What do you mean?

914
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:26,424
That wolf story.

915
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:30,362
About wolves being in Africa, I was testing
your knowledge.

916
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,931
Everyone knows that there are no wolves
there.

917
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:35,766
What do you say?

918
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,934
Besides you and me,
not too many people know.

919
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:40,171
He knows.

920
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:42,773
It's probably in your book, sir.

921
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:45,777
Do you have another copy of "Sitahoron in
Sahara"?

922
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:46,777
"Sitahoron"?

923
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:52,418
You are a very funny person, you know?

924
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:01,894
Eat quickly. Eat quickly.

925
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:20,778
Here. Wipe your face.

926
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:32,925
Don't go too far. I'll be in the car.

927
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:43,941
My mind says nothing but Lord Rama...

928
01:21:58,613 --> 01:21:59,477
Mukul.

929
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,857
Open the door, open the door!

930
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:10,855
What's the matter?

931
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:12,757
He was calling me.

932
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:13,727
Who?

933
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:15,189
A bad man.

934
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,656
Which bad guy? Is he from this life or your
past life?

935
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:32,844
I don't like this whole situation, Topshe.

936
01:22:40,421 --> 01:22:46,361
I kept thinking of a plan,
but it keeps vanishing.

937
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:05,877
Some people... are wearing masks.

938
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:11,985
Some are in the shadows and some are
completely in the dark.

939
01:23:12,854 --> 01:23:13,718
One suspect is Mr. M. Bose.

940
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:19,422
Certainly. He is in the mask
of a globetrotter.

941
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,862
But who he really is... is he one
of those con artists?

942
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,863
And the man on the train with bandages?

943
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:30,935
He spies on the Circuit House at night.

944
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:35,072
Is this the second con artist?

945
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:41,713
Do they want the hidden treasure? Or
something else?

946
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:43,714
Who else?

947
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:46,083
And Dr. Hajra.

948
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:04,169
Dr. Hajra recognised the fake mask
Bhabhananda Swami had.

949
01:24:06,574 --> 01:24:08,405
However, is he also wearing one?

950
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:14,577
It was surprising to see how someone who
specialises in parapsychology,

951
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:21,311
taking a nap next to someone who had the
answers to all of his questions.

952
01:24:25,326 --> 01:24:29,160
Probably, he's too frustrated now.

953
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:31,195
Dr. Hajra?

954
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:37,168
There is someone else who is more
suspicious than him.

955
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:38,168
Who?

956
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:39,803
Mukul's 'Bad Guy'

957
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:47,179
The one who fears camels... and vanished.

958
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:51,182
To where did he vanish? When?

959
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:54,618
Why did Mukul use the word 'vanish'?

960
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:57,187
Why can't we ask Mukul that?

961
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:02,227
Very good, Topshe. I was thinking that same
thing.

962
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:10,302
Besides past life recollections, what else
does this boy know?

963
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,191
Can you tell me what this is, Mukul?

964
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:35,192
Pen.

965
01:25:36,831 --> 01:25:37,695
And now?

966
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:38,862
Light.

967
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:43,435
And in this, you can see the golden fort.

968
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,364
Where is it?

969
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:49,441
This light. Inside this light.

970
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:51,008
Where?

971
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:54,472
Not here. Come with me.

972
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:00,485
Come and sit here.

973
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:10,547
Now, I'll put this light on your face,

974
01:26:10,548 --> 01:26:14,467
and you'll stare at it.

975
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:18,236
Then only I'll see the golden fort?

976
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:20,471
Ready.

977
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:21,739
Ready.

978
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:27,479
Mukul, stare at the light...
keep staring at the light...

979
01:26:29,617 --> 01:26:33,053
Stare...

980
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:36,489
stare... stare

981
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:44,064
Golden fort

982
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:49,503
Golden fort...

983
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:39,517
Mukul, can you hear me?

984
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:41,518
Yes, I can.

985
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:46,524
Where is your golden fort?

986
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:49,527
What is the name of that place?

987
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:53,531
Do you remember?

988
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:57,535
Jaaiiii...

989
01:27:57,672 --> 01:27:58,536
Jaipur.

990
01:27:58,806 --> 01:27:59,670
Shhhhh!

991
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:09,513
Tell me!

992
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:16,521
Jaisalmer.

993
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:20,524
Turn on the lights!

994
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:32,536
Jaisalmer! 200 miles from here!
There is a train as well.

995
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:34,305
At what time?

996
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:35,539
In the morning, at 9:45.

997
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:37,535
That will go to Pokhran which is 80 miles.

998
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:39,543
The rest we have to drive 120 miles.

999
01:28:39,914 --> 01:28:42,542
Why don't you just take the car the whole
way?

1000
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:45,549
No, you'll take the car.

1001
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:48,218
Just listen to my plan.

1002
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:52,141
Tomorrow, I'll take a rest,

1003
01:28:52,142 --> 01:28:54,559
and tell them to go
look at a fort in Jodhpur.

1004
01:28:55,630 --> 01:29:01,051
I'll then go to the
station, and you'll tell them

1005
01:29:01,052 --> 01:29:06,473
that Mukul told Dr. Hajra its
location and he took him there.

1006
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:08,205
Where did they go?

1007
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:09,574
Burmer. Will you remember?

1008
01:29:09,711 --> 01:29:10,575
Burmer?

1009
01:29:10,712 --> 01:29:11,576
Burmer.

1010
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:12,577
Do I have to send them to Burmer?

1011
01:29:12,714 --> 01:29:13,578
They will leave on their own.

1012
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:16,582
What if they ask why Dr. Hajra did not wait
for them?

1013
01:29:17,452 --> 01:29:19,317
Tell them Mukul was in a hurry.

1014
01:29:19,721 --> 01:29:21,940
Ok boss.
Then you'll leave at that time.

1015
01:29:21,941 --> 01:29:25,430
Pokhran? Pokhran. Right in the taxi.
I'll meet you there.

1016
01:29:25,431 --> 01:29:28,559
You'll meet me there then at Jaisalmer?
Yes, Jaisalmer. Ok, boss

1017
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:32,563
Go and put the boy to bed.

1018
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:42,743
Sleep my child, sleep well.
Now I know where's the wealth.

1019
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:08,600
Mukul, can I take your picture?

1020
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:21,578
Good morning.

1021
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:23,574
Did you finish your breakfast?

1022
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:27,585
Yes. Since I get up early, I finished my
workout first.

1023
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,621
You're looking very fit.

1024
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:31,614
What are you doing today?

1025
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:32,728
Rest.

1026
01:30:32,729 --> 01:30:34,685
Mukul needs that too.

1027
01:30:34,686 --> 01:30:38,597
I need some time to
think about things too.

1028
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,623
Anything new?

1029
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:48,005
Yes, actually. Camels, sand,
fort, and peacocks.

1030
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:51,609
Could they not have been
in another country?

1031
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,612
His past life thoughts
may not be from India, even.

1032
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:58,616
I never even thought about that.

1033
01:31:02,256 --> 01:31:05,623
I was thinking I would speak to Mukul today
too.

1034
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:09,593
After you come back,
then we'll sit down together.

1035
01:31:11,265 --> 01:31:15,585
I was thinking about your research interest.
In a country where there are

1036
01:31:15,586 --> 01:31:20,105
so many myths and superstitious beliefs,
is this not adding to it?

1037
01:31:20,106 --> 01:31:22,837
In the end, you'll find
many kids claiming to

1038
01:31:22,838 --> 01:31:27,846
have foresightedness of their past lives,
and you'll be running all over the world.

1039
01:31:35,289 --> 01:31:36,246
Good morning!

1040
01:31:36,247 --> 01:31:37,415
Don't leave that auto.

1041
01:31:37,416 --> 01:31:38,353
What?

1042
01:31:38,354 --> 01:31:39,415
We'll need that.

1043
01:31:39,927 --> 01:31:40,950
In this?

1044
01:31:40,951 --> 01:31:41,857
Yes.

1045
01:31:41,858 --> 01:31:43,057
Ok, please stay here.

1046
01:31:43,058 --> 01:31:44,894
I'm also leaving for Jaipur.

1047
01:31:44,932 --> 01:31:45,660
Leaving?

1048
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:47,624
Yes, this place is too uninteresting for me.

1049
01:32:03,284 --> 01:32:05,650
Topshe, keep on the lookout on the road.

1050
01:32:07,321 --> 01:32:08,250
Why?

1051
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:12,656
If you see a man covered in
a red shawl, tell me immediately.

1052
01:32:14,328 --> 01:32:15,557
What's going on?

1053
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:18,655
Like you, we are trying to figure out the
pieces in the puzzle.

1054
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:22,464
Oh, a mystery?

1055
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:34,094
I've always wanted
to be involved with

1056
01:32:34,095 --> 01:32:37,683
a real detective
solving a real mystery.

1057
01:32:41,055 --> 01:32:42,647
That probably won't happen.

1058
01:32:45,326 --> 01:32:47,658
Mr. Das speaking? Das is not there?

1059
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:54,665
And Dr. Hajra? I see, I see.

1060
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:02,673
The people staying at the Circuit House you
asked about, are not there

1061
01:33:03,811 --> 01:33:07,144
And the small child left the Circuit House
with Dr. Hajra... they don't know where.

1062
01:33:08,349 --> 01:33:13,685
My God! Look, I am Dr. Hajra!

1063
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:18,690
He's an imposter! A criminal!

1064
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:22,694
I'm a renowned parapsychologist.

1065
01:33:23,564 --> 01:33:24,528
What?

1066
01:33:24,529 --> 01:33:26,096
Do you know what telepathy is?

1067
01:33:26,567 --> 01:33:27,556
Telepathy?

1068
01:33:27,557 --> 01:33:28,633
Yes, yes.

1069
01:33:28,634 --> 01:33:29,700
No sir.

1070
01:33:30,338 --> 01:33:31,337
You don't?

1071
01:33:31,339 --> 01:33:32,303
No sir.

1072
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:41,710
I see.

1073
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:45,277
Tell me something, sir.

1074
01:33:46,354 --> 01:33:47,277
What?

1075
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:52,725
Was there ever a war in Jaisalmer?
It's not in the guide books.

1076
01:33:54,362 --> 01:33:56,694
This information is very important to me.

1077
01:33:57,999 --> 01:34:00,365
I know there was. It was a long time ago.

1078
01:34:01,002 --> 01:34:03,368
Allaudin Kirji attacked Jaisalmer.

1079
01:34:08,376 --> 01:34:10,708
Look at the beautiful pottery
made of golden stone!

1080
01:34:13,381 --> 01:34:14,712
Have you ever seen this type of golden stone
before?

1081
01:34:15,616 --> 01:34:16,583
Stop the auto... stop!

1082
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:31,832
Can you show me the golden bowl you have
in the window?

1083
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:43,506
These are quite solid! How much are these?

1084
01:34:44,378 --> 01:34:45,345
Only 25 rupees.

1085
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:47,243
Where did you get this from?

1086
01:34:47,748 --> 01:34:50,717
This is from Jaisalmer. It's great quality.
Please take it.

1087
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:56,808
Jaisalmer? Yellow limestone.

1088
01:34:56,809 --> 01:34:59,719
Lal Mohan, let's go.

1089
01:35:14,742 --> 01:35:18,134
Hey Mister, where are you going?

1090
01:35:18,135 --> 01:35:21,739
They left here almost an hour ago.

1091
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:23,079
Where to?

1092
01:35:23,284 --> 01:35:26,742
The child remembered the name of the
place... I wrote it down for you.

1093
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:35,718
Burmer?

1094
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:38,365
I haven't heard that name before.

1095
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:42,098
Why did they leave in such a hurry?

1096
01:35:42,269 --> 01:35:47,229
The child became restless and even ripped
off the sleeve on his shirt.

1097
01:35:49,276 --> 01:35:50,243
Burmer?

1098
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:58,274
He told me to tell you to follow him
immediately. He's waiting for you.

1099
01:35:58,719 --> 01:35:59,708
The car just arrived too.

1100
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:10,753
The boy has left?

1101
01:36:28,482 --> 01:36:29,449
What's wrong?

1102
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:43,819
Do you want to have some?

1103
01:37:00,281 --> 01:37:02,272
A bowl made of golden limestone.

1104
01:37:32,313 --> 01:37:33,302
Can you show me the guest record book
please?

1105
01:37:43,324 --> 01:37:44,413
Oh my god!

1106
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:49,296
I need a taxi. Jaisalmer and back.

1107
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:54,326
Topshe, tell them to pack some lunches
within a half hour.

1108
01:38:05,346 --> 01:38:08,887
Phelu, it's your test to check

1109
01:38:08,888 --> 01:38:12,309
your telepathic intuition now.

1110
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:17,847
Bhabhananda, your game is over now.

1111
01:38:21,528 --> 01:38:24,965
Earthquake. Floods. Storm...

1112
01:38:24,966 --> 01:38:28,925
it doesn't fit into anything.

1113
01:38:31,338 --> 01:38:32,327
Oh no!

1114
01:38:34,341 --> 01:38:36,332
Topshe, pack your luggage.

1115
01:38:41,982 --> 01:38:42,971
Mr. Lal Mohan...

1116
01:38:43,384 --> 01:38:44,351
Yes?

1117
01:38:44,818 --> 01:38:48,811
By pointing out the golden pottery, you've
helped me immensely.

1118
01:38:50,357 --> 01:38:54,350
That's why I'm fulfilling your wish
by giving you an opportunity.

1119
01:38:55,362 --> 01:38:56,351
Ok.

1120
01:39:03,637 --> 01:39:05,628
Packing your things would take how long?

1121
01:39:06,373 --> 01:39:07,340
Only three minutes.

1122
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:10,343
Oh no.

1123
01:39:11,111 --> 01:39:15,808
I'll tell you everything
when the time is right.

1124
01:39:15,809 --> 01:39:18,108
But right now, keep quiet.

1125
01:39:24,124 --> 01:39:26,115
Could you give me your word?

1126
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:28,350
Yes.

1127
01:39:42,376 --> 01:39:48,372
Oh, so you are planning to go to Jaisalmer?
I'll show you.

1128
01:39:51,018 --> 01:39:53,384
Can I ask where we're going?

1129
01:39:54,154 --> 01:39:55,121
Jaisalmer.

1130
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:58,925
The Rajasthan Bhatti people had a kingdom
there.

1131
01:39:58,926 --> 01:40:02,919
It was in the Thar desert almost 800 years
ago and they had a huge palace.

1132
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:09,993
The pottery you found is made of the same
golden stone that the palace was made from.

1133
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:14,664
So, we can conclude, that the golden fort
is that same palace in Rajasthan.

1134
01:40:16,377 --> 01:40:18,368
And my firm belief is that...

1135
01:40:25,052 --> 01:40:27,020
I want to give you some tips before I leave.

1136
01:40:28,122 --> 01:40:29,111
Go on.

1137
01:40:29,423 --> 01:40:32,182
If the man is less than
five and a half feet,

1138
01:40:32,183 --> 01:40:33,382
you should suspect him.

1139
01:40:34,128 --> 01:40:35,095
I'll see you then.

1140
01:40:35,429 --> 01:40:37,397
You know what my mind is telling me?

1141
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:38,788
What?

1142
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:40,389
We'll see each other again.

1143
01:40:42,403 --> 01:40:44,394
I'll be extremely overjoyed if that happens.

1144
01:40:51,011 --> 01:40:52,000
Brazilian scorpion.

1145
01:40:55,082 --> 01:40:59,075
Brazilian scorpion. Let me write that down

1146
01:41:37,424 --> 01:41:39,415
Lal Mohan. Look there's a camel!

1147
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:48,333
Can I ask you a question about camels?

1148
01:41:48,469 --> 01:41:49,436
Sure.

1149
01:41:51,438 --> 01:41:53,429
Are these wild camels?

1150
01:41:53,707 --> 01:41:54,696
Probably not.

1151
01:41:57,444 --> 01:41:58,433
What do they eat then?

1152
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:02,438
Plants with thorns.

1153
01:42:03,183 --> 01:42:05,174
Do they take out the thorns?

1154
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:07,109
No.

1155
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:23,826
I won't ask a question, but I have something
to say.

1156
01:42:24,304 --> 01:42:25,293
May I?

1157
01:42:25,472 --> 01:42:26,461
Say it.

1158
01:42:28,475 --> 01:42:31,499
I'm hoping that you're carrying

1159
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:36,473
something to protect
yourselves if you are in danger.

1160
01:42:38,218 --> 01:42:40,186
Because, someone has taken my protection.

1161
01:42:40,487 --> 01:42:41,476
Who?

1162
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:48,450
Robbers. There are many robbers in this
robber infested state.

1163
01:42:51,465 --> 01:42:57,223
I only have this...

1164
01:42:57,224 --> 01:43:01,466
as a souvenir.

1165
01:43:02,476 --> 01:43:06,469
Then the robber is not greedy since the
sword holder is very expensive.

1166
01:43:07,481 --> 01:43:09,472
So if you're in danger...

1167
01:43:19,493 --> 01:43:20,482
Are your tires old or something?

1168
01:43:21,228 --> 01:43:23,196
Well, sir, just come out
and see the disaster.

1169
01:43:51,525 --> 01:43:54,517
Yes, yes, I have a telepathic power!

1170
01:43:55,529 --> 01:43:59,488
We came in the right direction, and that's
why someone wants to stop us!

1171
01:44:00,767 --> 01:44:03,736
Topshe, let's move these!

1172
01:44:10,544 --> 01:44:11,511
Mr. Singh, please drive carefully.

1173
01:44:12,546 --> 01:44:14,514
Another tire puncture
will cause us problems.

1174
01:44:17,517 --> 01:44:23,513
No questions. No questions. No questions.

1175
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:30,496
Mr. Lal Mohan?

1176
01:44:31,565 --> 01:44:36,966
Two extremely dangerous men
have taken Mukul to Jaisalmer,

1177
01:44:36,967 --> 01:44:39,529
in hopes of a hidden treasure.

1178
01:44:41,541 --> 01:44:47,537
When we get there,
we may have to fight with them.

1179
01:44:49,549 --> 01:44:52,455
If you're up for the challenge,

1180
01:44:52,456 --> 01:44:57,513
then your next book can
be about this adventure.

1181
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:03,263
Now can I ask you question?

1182
01:45:04,231 --> 01:45:05,220
Yes, you can.

1183
01:45:06,566 --> 01:45:07,533
Are you a detective?

1184
01:45:12,339 --> 01:45:18,335
Yes, but not like the hero in your book.

1185
01:45:22,549 --> 01:45:24,540
Private investigator!

1186
01:45:26,586 --> 01:45:28,554
Topshe is my assistant.

1187
01:45:38,565 --> 01:45:41,557
Are we now chasing dangerous robbers?

1188
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:48,530
Robbers, yes... but they are from Calcutta.

1189
01:45:56,717 --> 01:46:02,587
If you are a little hesitant,
we can drop you off at Pokram.

1190
01:46:02,689 --> 01:46:03,614
Why?

1191
01:46:03,615 --> 01:46:05,087
You'll get a train there.

1192
01:46:05,559 --> 01:46:06,548
And go back?

1193
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:08,923
I'm telling you there's danger ahead.

1194
01:46:09,596 --> 01:46:15,557
Danger? I laugh at the face of danger.

1195
01:46:23,577 --> 01:46:25,568
Mr. Singh! Mr. Singh!

1196
01:46:40,627 --> 01:46:46,361
Who did this? Who gathered this many
shards of glass and put them on the road?

1197
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,261
Why don't you guess?

1198
01:46:49,603 --> 01:46:50,592
What?

1199
01:46:52,106 --> 01:46:57,946
Pheluda! There are no signs
of cities or villages,

1200
01:46:57,947 --> 01:47:00,308
and no train lines either.

1201
01:47:00,914 --> 01:47:04,073
We wouldn't have caught a train anyway... it
has reached Pokhran by now.

1202
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:05,700
It could run late though.

1203
01:47:06,054 --> 01:47:07,137
Mr. Singh!

1204
01:47:07,138 --> 01:47:10,621
If another taxi comes, can
we get a spare tire from them?

1205
01:47:10,658 --> 01:47:13,624
Yes, but not too many cars
drive on this road, sir.

1206
01:47:14,261 --> 01:47:15,626
Where is the nearest train station?

1207
01:47:16,029 --> 01:47:17,963
It is Ramdeora,
which is 8-10 miles from here.

1208
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:20,762
Are you thinking about a train at night?

1209
01:47:21,635 --> 01:47:24,866
The train gets there at 3 in the morning.

1210
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:28,984
If we wait at the
station, the taxi can come

1211
01:47:28,985 --> 01:47:33,068
come and meet us there...
or we can catch the train.

1212
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:33,909
What time will we reach Jaisalmer?

1213
01:47:35,415 --> 01:47:36,746
At 7:30 in the morning.

1214
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:38,082
Do you want to go to Ramdeora?

1215
01:47:39,085 --> 01:47:40,916
Unless the car is fixed,
we should get the train, right?

1216
01:47:41,721 --> 01:47:43,788
Want to ride the camel there? Look!

1217
01:47:53,867 --> 01:47:54,856
Yes, stop them.

1218
01:47:55,869 --> 01:47:57,233
Hey! Stop!

1219
01:47:59,406 --> 01:48:01,431
So Mr. Lal Mohan,
do you want to ride a camel?

1220
01:48:02,042 --> 01:48:03,004
Camel?

1221
01:48:03,009 --> 01:48:03,970
Yes.

1222
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:05,318
Wow.

1223
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:08,846
I never thought all of my
dreams would come true like this.

1224
01:48:09,183 --> 01:48:11,214
It is the power of telepathy. Let's go!

1225
01:48:12,352 --> 01:48:14,684
I wish I could be an Arabian camel rider.

1226
01:48:53,593 --> 01:48:54,924
Make sure you know how to get on the
camel

1227
01:48:58,498 --> 01:49:02,264
They sit down with their front legs folded,
first.

1228
01:49:02,869 --> 01:49:04,166
And when they get up, it's reverse.

1229
01:49:06,306 --> 01:49:08,638
Remember that, and you won't have
problems.

1230
01:49:08,975 --> 01:49:10,636
Watch me. I'm getting on.

1231
01:49:13,713 --> 01:49:15,007
Topshe, get on.

1232
01:49:26,426 --> 01:49:27,757
Are you ok?

1233
01:49:28,228 --> 01:49:30,560
Great! Mr. Lal Mohan, get on.
It's very easy.

1234
01:49:49,049 --> 01:49:52,314
Are you ok? Ok, let's go.

1235
01:49:58,725 --> 01:50:02,684
Mr. Singh, once your tire gets fixed, please
meet us quickly.

1236
01:50:02,963 --> 01:50:04,294
Sure thing! I will!

1237
01:50:20,548 --> 01:50:21,877
This is fun, Pheluda!

1238
01:50:23,551 --> 01:50:24,980
Make sure he's ok behind you.

1239
01:50:31,559 --> 01:50:32,923
Mr. Lal Mohan?

1240
01:50:32,924 --> 01:50:33,825
Yes.

1241
01:50:36,063 --> 01:50:37,694
What is your dream telling you?

1242
01:50:38,166 --> 01:50:40,297
It's telling me this is reality.

1243
01:50:43,171 --> 01:50:45,300
Where you are sitting...

1244
01:50:45,301 --> 01:50:46,201
Yes?

1245
01:50:46,602 --> 01:50:48,705
That hump contains its supply of water.

1246
01:50:49,376 --> 01:50:50,707
What will become of me riding this camel?

1247
01:50:52,379 --> 01:50:53,710
Do you need a hump too?

1248
01:50:55,382 --> 01:50:57,714
I need water! I'm thirsty.

1249
01:51:26,513 --> 01:51:28,242
Pheluda! Train!

1250
01:51:33,486 --> 01:51:34,817
Turn around. We have to stop that train.

1251
01:52:15,595 --> 01:52:16,425
Look it's them!

1252
01:52:31,611 --> 01:52:36,275
Wonderful. Let's go.

1253
01:52:55,301 --> 01:52:56,131
What happened?

1254
01:52:56,302 --> 01:52:57,132
Why?

1255
01:52:57,303 --> 01:52:59,134
I saw them on the camels.

1256
01:53:00,306 --> 01:53:03,139
I told them to go to Burmer and they are
going to Jaisalmer now?

1257
01:53:04,277 --> 01:53:08,145
Look. I think they are going
to Ramdeora, the previous station.

1258
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:11,148
From there, they'll catch the night train,
understand?

1259
01:53:11,285 --> 01:53:13,719
I'll drop you off there,
and after you finish

1260
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:16,153
your work, you come
straight to Jaisalmer.

1261
01:53:16,289 --> 01:53:19,156
You mean our first plan?

1262
01:53:28,868 --> 01:53:29,732
Ok.

1263
01:53:31,871 --> 01:53:33,702
Hold on, hold on! One minute!

1264
01:53:33,973 --> 01:53:34,803
What's the matter?

1265
01:53:35,975 --> 01:53:37,806
Give me some money, my pockets are empty!

1266
01:53:37,977 --> 01:53:38,807
The glass bottles cost me all the money.

1267
01:53:38,978 --> 01:53:39,808
I need to eat dinner.

1268
01:53:41,548 --> 01:53:42,605
Eat?

1269
01:53:42,816 --> 01:53:43,544
Yes! Solid food.

1270
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:45,080
Or drink?

1271
01:53:46,219 --> 01:53:47,310
Just Horlicks.

1272
01:53:50,957 --> 01:53:51,821
Remember it.

1273
01:53:52,959 --> 01:53:53,823
Ok.

1274
01:54:05,972 --> 01:54:11,894
Try to get up. Give me your hand...

1275
01:54:11,895 --> 01:54:17,816
and stand up straight.

1276
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:20,817
There we go! Very good!

1277
01:54:21,988 --> 01:54:23,819
What happened? Did you get a hump too?

1278
01:54:24,157 --> 01:54:25,818
No, I'm feeling fine now.

1279
01:54:26,993 --> 01:54:27,823
Here, eat some sweets.

1280
01:54:27,994 --> 01:54:28,824
Let me recover some more.

1281
01:54:28,995 --> 01:54:29,825
Ok, here, Topshe.

1282
01:54:33,967 --> 01:54:35,832
Topshe, keep an eye on the road.

1283
01:54:36,336 --> 01:54:37,598
For a taxi, right?

1284
01:54:37,971 --> 01:54:39,836
If you see headlights, immediately go there.

1285
01:55:23,016 --> 01:55:27,851
This experience I'm gaining couldn't even
compare to any of my adventure stories.

1286
01:55:30,023 --> 01:55:32,856
Are you saying your experiences are over?

1287
01:55:34,027 --> 01:55:36,860
No, there are no more camels though.

1288
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:37,860
That's right. Then?

1289
01:55:38,031 --> 01:55:42,866
Nothing compares to camel riding.

1290
01:55:43,036 --> 01:55:46,870
Eat this. This is what authentic mountain
robbers eat.

1291
01:55:54,013 --> 01:55:58,882
If I had my weapon now, I'd feel safe.

1292
01:56:00,687 --> 01:56:02,882
That was a very nice dagger.

1293
01:56:04,057 --> 01:56:05,888
Does the detective you write about use a
dagger?

1294
01:56:11,331 --> 01:56:12,161
Ask him.

1295
01:56:14,033 --> 01:56:15,864
So? Topshe?

1296
01:56:16,869 --> 01:56:17,699
Revolver.

1297
01:56:25,044 --> 01:56:27,877
What kind of revolver did he use?

1298
01:56:28,681 --> 01:56:32,913
A revolver is a revolver, it has 6 bullets.
Bang!

1299
01:56:41,027 --> 01:56:45,896
Like this? This is a Colt 32.

1300
01:56:49,068 --> 01:56:49,898
Is this loaded?

1301
01:56:55,074 --> 01:56:56,905
This is where the bullets are kept. Bang!

1302
01:56:58,878 --> 01:57:02,075
This is the trigger... this is the hammer

1303
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:07,884
Besides this, there are several other kinds.

1304
01:57:08,788 --> 01:57:09,652
Really?

1305
01:57:11,057 --> 01:57:14,119
You should know this,

1306
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:18,930
especially if you write about it.

1307
01:59:29,128 --> 01:59:32,996
Lal Mohan, please get up. Topshe, the train
has arrived.

1308
02:00:06,032 --> 02:00:08,000
Topshe, Lal Mohan, get on.

1309
02:00:16,175 --> 02:00:18,006
Where are the lights?

1310
02:00:19,178 --> 02:00:20,008
The lights aren't working, Pheluda.

1311
02:00:23,149 --> 02:00:24,013
There aren't any bulbs.

1312
02:00:24,150 --> 02:00:25,014
It's ok.

1313
02:00:26,152 --> 02:00:27,983
Lal Mohan, look at that wall,
perhaps there is a switch.

1314
02:00:28,154 --> 02:00:28,984
Over here?

1315
02:00:29,155 --> 02:00:29,985
Yes.

1316
02:00:32,158 --> 02:00:33,022
Yes, got it.

1317
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:35,024
Wonderful. Night light?

1318
02:00:38,364 --> 02:00:41,026
Topshe, open the beds. Go to bed too.

1319
02:00:41,267 --> 02:00:44,031
You in the middle, and Lal Mohan on the
other side.

1320
02:00:44,370 --> 02:00:46,031
I can go to that side.

1321
02:00:46,172 --> 02:00:47,036
Listen to what I say.

1322
02:00:48,174 --> 02:00:49,004
I'll sleep here.

1323
02:00:49,175 --> 02:00:50,005
No sir.

1324
02:00:51,177 --> 02:00:53,008
He'll get up early in the morning and do
Yoga.

1325
02:00:53,179 --> 02:00:57,013
There's Yoga. But if someone disturbs us,
I'll take care of that too.

1326
02:00:58,184 --> 02:01:02,018
Wow. Your life is so exciting, huh?

1327
02:01:13,199 --> 02:01:17,033
After I saw your weapon, I'm feeling much
more protected.

1328
02:01:24,210 --> 02:01:27,043
Oh no. There's no lock?

1329
02:01:27,213 --> 02:01:28,043
What? Must be the robbers.

1330
02:04:31,797 --> 02:04:33,059
What happened?

1331
02:04:35,835 --> 02:04:41,137
Bhabhananda's disciple... now your game is
over.

1332
02:04:42,408 --> 02:04:46,061
Get up... get up.

1333
02:04:46,062 --> 02:04:50,144
Hands up. Hands up!

1334
02:04:51,016 --> 02:04:56,386
Back up... back up. Do you know what kind of
punishment you'll get?

1335
02:04:56,922 --> 02:05:01,120
3 months jail, and within 7 days you'll be
hanged.

1336
02:05:02,962 --> 02:05:07,126
Now tell us, what happened
at Nahargarh fort?

1337
02:05:08,667 --> 02:05:10,688
Tell us, tell us.

1338
02:05:10,689 --> 02:05:16,039
We have a lot of time
now... tell us the truth.

1339
02:05:18,777 --> 02:05:20,176
What are you doing?

1340
02:05:45,271 --> 02:05:46,431
He went into another room.

1341
02:05:49,108 --> 02:05:55,080
So? A companion like you
leads only to disaster.

1342
02:05:58,817 --> 02:06:01,183
Our enemy is quite strong.

1343
02:06:06,859 --> 02:06:10,192
So? Are there robbers in Rajasthan or not?

1344
02:06:12,364 --> 02:06:16,698
You don't know what M. Bose is capable of.

1345
02:06:21,273 --> 02:06:23,605
Who's there?

1346
02:06:33,953 --> 02:06:36,183
MR. BOSE; HEY, door!

1347
02:07:09,321 --> 02:07:11,221
Aren't you Mr. Das?

1348
02:07:12,257 --> 02:07:14,316
Or is that your alias?

1349
02:07:16,795 --> 02:07:18,387
Don't you recognise me?

1350
02:07:22,768 --> 02:07:24,633
We've known each other for a long time.

1351
02:07:25,671 --> 02:07:31,608
Since Allahabad, in 1962, do you remember?

1352
02:07:34,346 --> 02:07:35,142
Who is screaming?

1353
02:07:37,950 --> 02:07:39,008
Hopefully that culprit has left

1354
02:07:53,899 --> 02:07:59,235
Topshe. This is the golden fort

1355
02:08:00,806 --> 02:08:02,603
Lal Mohan... get up!

1356
02:08:03,809 --> 02:08:04,776
Camels?!

1357
02:08:05,477 --> 02:08:06,808
Get up! We're in Jaisalmer

1358
02:08:07,212 --> 02:08:07,940
Oh! We're here?

1359
02:08:22,561 --> 02:08:23,721
You wait here.

1360
02:08:32,738 --> 02:08:34,076
Dr Hajra?

1361
02:08:38,177 --> 02:08:42,239
This is my card

1362
02:08:44,149 --> 02:08:46,515
And this is Mr. Sudhir's letter for you.

1363
02:08:55,427 --> 02:08:56,257
Let's go to the waiting room
and I'll tell you everything.

1364
02:08:57,362 --> 02:08:58,192
We want to hear your story too.

1365
02:08:58,964 --> 02:08:59,794
And Mukul?

1366
02:09:01,567 --> 02:09:04,764
He's probably somewhere around this
golden fort.

1367
02:09:05,471 --> 02:09:10,941
We have to wait for a taxi that we hired.
There is no other transportation.

1368
02:09:13,613 --> 02:09:15,352
I can assure you of one thing,

1369
02:09:15,353 --> 02:09:19,585
that my responsibility of bringing
Mukul back home is no less than yours.

1370
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:29,026
Do you recall this, Mukul?

1371
02:09:29,027 --> 02:09:29,891
It's the golden fort.

1372
02:09:32,197 --> 02:09:33,255
And your house?

1373
02:09:34,133 --> 02:09:36,067
Inside the fort there is a city.

1374
02:09:37,336 --> 02:09:39,167
Really? Ok... Let's go.

1375
02:09:51,450 --> 02:09:54,317
There is no hidden treasure? How do you
know?

1376
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:58,954
In my notebook, I have written that he was a
jewelry maker.

1377
02:10:00,659 --> 02:10:05,528
Probably this is the reason he has seen
jewels.

1378
02:10:13,972 --> 02:10:19,016
Mukul!

1379
02:10:36,495 --> 02:10:42,331
What are you doing up there? Get down!

1380
02:10:47,439 --> 02:10:48,269
There was a temple...

1381
02:11:02,154 --> 02:11:04,987
Mr. Singh! Mr. Singh! Stop!

1382
02:11:11,897 --> 02:11:13,762
Pheluda, the cab is here.

1383
02:11:17,102 --> 02:11:17,966
We're leaving now, Dr. Hajra.

1384
02:11:18,637 --> 02:11:22,505
Our belongings are with you, you should get
some rest.

1385
02:11:22,674 --> 02:11:26,508
I just wish that Mukul
will come back safely.

1386
02:11:26,678 --> 02:11:27,508
So long then.

1387
02:11:30,649 --> 02:11:34,517
Oh, one more thing. This might be helpful to
you.

1388
02:11:34,653 --> 02:11:35,483
M. Bose left this.

1389
02:11:38,657 --> 02:11:40,488
Yes! This is mine!

1390
02:11:45,264 --> 02:11:46,094
Temple.

1391
02:11:47,266 --> 02:11:48,096
And your house? Your house?

1392
02:11:56,275 --> 02:11:58,140
This is Ratan's house.

1393
02:11:59,278 --> 02:12:01,143
And this is Giridhari's house.

1394
02:12:02,281 --> 02:12:04,146
We used to play Holi here.

1395
02:12:07,286 --> 02:12:08,116
This is a road.

1396
02:12:08,287 --> 02:12:09,117
What road?

1397
02:12:09,288 --> 02:12:10,118
The road to our house.

1398
02:12:11,290 --> 02:12:13,121
Which one?

1399
02:12:13,292 --> 02:12:16,125
Over there on the right side.

1400
02:12:16,762 --> 02:12:17,592
Let's go then.

1401
02:12:32,277 --> 02:12:36,145
Why are you scaring him? Why are you
scaring him?

1402
02:12:36,281 --> 02:12:40,149
Go away! Go away!

1403
02:12:48,327 --> 02:12:49,157
Don't kill him!

1404
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:58,133
You are bad... you are a bad man!

1405
02:12:59,304 --> 02:13:00,134
Mukul! Mukul!

1406
02:13:09,982 --> 02:13:11,041
Can I come with you?

1407
02:13:11,142 --> 02:13:12,006
Sure.

1408
02:13:21,326 --> 02:13:22,156
Mukul!

1409
02:13:31,336 --> 02:13:33,167
Topshe, you go cover this side, I'll be over
here.

1410
02:14:35,367 --> 02:14:36,197
Good job, Topshe!

1411
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:43,205
You've wasted your time Bhabhananda. There
is no hidden treasure here.

1412
02:14:43,942 --> 02:14:46,775
Whether there is a past life or not.

1413
02:14:49,381 --> 02:14:52,214
Mr. Singh, Let's take him to the police
station.

1414
02:14:52,384 --> 02:14:53,214
Very good, sir.

1415
02:15:05,363 --> 02:15:07,194
Look at that man!

1416
02:15:14,039 --> 02:15:16,234
Get down Mukul, we have to go now.

1417
02:15:17,876 --> 02:15:18,740
Where are we going?

1418
02:15:20,378 --> 02:15:21,242
Wherever you want to go.

1419
02:15:25,383 --> 02:15:27,214
I want to go home... to Calcutta.

1420
02:15:28,386 --> 02:15:33,221
I'll be going there too.
I have to write my 28th book.

1421
02:15:34,392 --> 02:15:36,223
And Phelu and Topshe?

1422
02:15:37,395 --> 02:15:38,225
We're all going back to Calcutta.

1423
02:15:39,397 --> 02:15:45,335
We'll all take you back home safely.
