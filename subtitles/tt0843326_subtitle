1
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,989
This is the first problem
between a father & son.

2
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,394
The attempts made by the child
to walk on it's own isn't wrong.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,833
Fatherfears that he might fall.
It isn't wrong either.

4
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:14,899
But if a father doesn't leave his
son's hand even after 24 years?

5
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,797
All fathers in this world are...

6
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,368
Are you mad to kick my scooter?

7
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,564
Why kick my scooter?

8
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,674
What is your problem?

9
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:51,610
My father.

10
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,406
What did he do?

11
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:54,877
He doesn't give me what I want.

12
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,379
Then, it is sure a problem.

13
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,108
But he gives more than I ask for.

14
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,051
How could that be a problem?

15
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,581
Have you gone mad?

16
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,880
You must be lucky to get a father like him.

17
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,186
You won't understand.

18
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,355
You are also a father.

19
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,556
To understand my problems,
ask the mirrors of Lifestyle trial rooms.

20
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,320
They will explain.

21
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:28,413
No. I don't want this.

22
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,047
I want international brands.
- Okay sir.

23
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:34,278
I want latest trend.

24
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,222
Try this. It's good.

25
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,751
It's for my son & not for me.

26
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,186
He has selected one already.

27
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,464
What will you think if you see
someone wearing this dress?

28
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,967
That's latest fashion.
Youth style.

29
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,503
And now?
- It gives a royal & a dignified look.

30
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,013
What if he tucks in the shirt?

31
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:06,309
What did you say?
-Youth.

32
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,079
Go & change.

33
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,160
I've come to select a shirt for Siddhu.

34
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,367
Wonderful designs.

35
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,068
We didn't have so many
patterns in our days.

36
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,541
It took me 2 hours to select...

37
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,347
Got inner wear?
-Yes sir.

38
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,419
It's tough going.
You agree, don't you?

39
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,749
Still, yourfather's character is different.

40
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,517
This is nothing.

41
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,190
There is lot more.

42
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,128
That one.
- Okay sir.

43
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:02,899
What is this?

44
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,109
Laughing at my problems, ah?

45
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,954
Sorry. Tell me more.

46
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,080
When I ask him for a pencil,
he gets me a parker pen.

47
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,756
I'll ask for a cycle,
he gets me a bike.

48
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,026
I'll ask for jaggery, he gets me
chocolates from America.

49
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,794
He does what he likes most.

50
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,055
Isn't there a solution to this?

51
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,564
Why not?

52
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,569
I've decided to do 2 things
of my choice in life.

53
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,366
Are your problems solved?

54
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:36,634
Now I've more problems.

55
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,845
Why?
-All fathers in this world are...

56
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,290
Sathi, a good servant.

57
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:01,896
I escaped today.

58
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,570
Sir, please get up.
It's too late.

59
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,769
So what?

60
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,910
Everyday must start as we wish.

61
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,268
Father has got up.

62
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,645
Your wish.

63
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,385
Tell her I'm not here.
- Sathi is not here.

64
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,020
Why did you come half way through?

65
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,621
I need at least half of my salary.

66
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,553
I can't tolerate your practical experiments.

67
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,023
Rs. 50 for applying cream.
- That's facial.

68
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,324
Rs. 100 to curl my hair.
- It's called curls.

69
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,328
Rs. 10 to cut my nails.

70
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,334
That's called manicure.
- She takes away my salary.

71
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,632
Either set up a beauty parlourfor her,

72
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,901
or else hang a "Beauty Parlour" board in
front of the house.-Will you shut up?

73
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,839
Brother, come.
I'll do a facial foryou.

74
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,274
How much?
- Rs. 100.

75
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,577
I'll will give Rs. 100 extra.

76
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,113
Remove his facial.

77
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,281
And do a facial again for him.

78
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,577
Sir...

79
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,682
If you come back without having lunch.
Hey Gautham...

80
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,891
You forgot your mobile, darling.

81
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,927
Why don't you talk to me?

82
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,656
Don't you have anything to talk?

83
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,302
Is money more important to you?
- Hang the phone, mom.

84
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,300
Shut up.

85
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:13,766
Siddhu, give me the phone...

86
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,834
Hello America, how are you?

87
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,504
I'm fine.

88
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,336
When are you coming back?

89
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:21,905
I know you won't come.

90
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,507
Get me liquor while coming.

91
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:25,818
Give me the phone.

92
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,480
What did he tell you?

93
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,283
I heard him say something to you.

94
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,662
Got ready so soon?

95
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:44,865
Take this.

96
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:46,899
Superb.

97
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,169
I prepared it.

98
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,705
I mean the song was superb.

99
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:52,769
Move.

100
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,380
Why don't you listen to me?

101
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,674
What?
-You have a great future.

102
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,179
You will become a great singer in future.
- Get lost.

103
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:01,887
Won't you believe me?

104
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:03,550
What is it?

105
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:04,322
Accept it.

106
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,285
Yes I accept that I will become
a great singer in future.

107
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,654
Good.

108
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,361
Are you coming home atleast this month?

109
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:13,498
Okay.

110
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,058
Children are getting ready to school.
- Talking to son-in-law?

111
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:17,526
Yes daddy.

112
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,462
Tell him not to drive fast.
- Okay.

113
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,663
Good morning grandfather.

114
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,341
Good morning father.
- Good morning father-in-law.

115
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,437
Good morning dear.

116
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:30,611
I gave you the Dam construction data file.
- I'm going through it...

117
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,350
I finished reading it last night.

118
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,313
I've filled the tender papers too.
You just sign them.

119
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:36,388
Okay father.

120
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,823
He pledged his life for
a mobile & a car.

121
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:42,661
Siddhu, do you remember
what day is today?

122
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:45,761
Anybody's birthday?

123
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,958
You asked me 6 months time
to come to office.

124
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,834
Today is the last day.

125
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,728
Actually...

126
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,035
Why are you eating so small pieces?

127
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:02,413
Take a big piece.
Dip it in chutney.

128
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,651
Now eat. Good.

129
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,547
Atleast you tell him to eat that way.

130
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,751
I eat like you do.
When I grow up, I will be like you.

131
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:12,447
Uncle...

132
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,885
You will change your opinion
after growing up.

133
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,255
Siddhu, you are coming to office, right?

134
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,187
Office...?

135
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,699
Actually, I'm doing CAD course.

136
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:22,898
I need 3 more months.

137
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,093
You asked me for a year's time
and I gave it.

138
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,298
Then you asked for 6 more months
and I gave it.

139
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:28,736
Now 3 months.

140
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:31,209
Do one thing.

141
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:35,812
Give me a week's time instead.
I will tell you.

142
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,580
I used ask him some more time.

143
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,044
Why is he asking me now?

144
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,689
Shall I tell you what I know
or shall I find out from him?

145
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:44,579
Tell me what you know.

146
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,383
He wants you to marry.
- Marriage...?!

147
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,161
Shit!

148
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,169
Why are you laughing?

149
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,001
Is my problem a joke to you all?

150
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,501
Yourfather is finding a girl foryou.

151
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,838
How could that be a joke?
It is very serious.

152
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:09,944
He is making me go mad!

153
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,480
We had so many dreams.

154
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,350
Everyone of ours is a love marriage.

155
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,845
But he is a disgrace to our gang .

156
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,448
Every gang will have a traitor like you.

157
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,382
Why don't you understand my problems?

158
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,950
Everyone has problems.

159
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,727
Don't they have problems?
Don't I have problems?

160
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,463
Doesn't she have problems?

161
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,693
Aren't we married?
-A girl on your right is gazing at you.

162
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,562
Don't turn.

163
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,903
Why are you smiling at me?

164
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,369
Trying to flatter me? Get lost.

165
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:42,978
You won't come up in life.

166
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,147
You shout at every girl you see.

167
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,509
And say that you want true love.

168
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,243
Insult to our gang.

169
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,681
Marry the girl yourfather has chosen.

170
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:52,947
Mark my words.

171
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,852
2 things in my life must be of my choice.

172
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:57,429
One is my career.

173
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,056
I can't do a job where my job is only to sign.

174
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:02,959
Two is my marriage.

175
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,000
I won't accept any girl as
my life partner unless I like her.

176
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,433
When did the film "Hello Brother"
was released?

177
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,370
Why?
- He has been saying this since then.

178
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,938
I asked you for a loan
to start a business.

179
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,804
You said you've good reach.
What did you do?

180
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,013
You asked for Rs. 2.5 millions
not Rs. 25. I need time.

181
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,218
Got it. Everything needs time.

182
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,049
Atleast he is trying. But you...?

183
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,650
Forget about trapping a girl.

184
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:27,915
Had you ever ogled at any girl?

185
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,788
I don't want to trap a girl.

186
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,523
I'm want to fall in love.

187
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,257
I know about my father very well.

188
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,964
He goes to about 10 shops
to get me a pair of shoes.

189
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,797
He would take a year
to select a girl for me.

190
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,834
But before that I will choose a girl.

191
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,603
Stand by your word.
We will do the rest.

192
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,246
We will somehow find your dream girl.

193
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,209
Hey, girls...!

194
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:31,483
Where can we find a Telugu Juliet?

195
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:39,955
Let's find her & unite them...

196
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,325
Be it any caste, I don't care...

197
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,160
She must be good looking...

198
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,199
Be it any religion, I don't care...

199
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,305
She must have a good heart...

200
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,637
A movie star...

201
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,975
or a tennis star...

202
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:57,145
who do you like?

203
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,557
Isn't the girl in red sari beautiful?

204
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,899
But her husband must agree...

205
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,240
There goes the college topper girl...

206
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,245
I don't need a mobile library...

207
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,352
Here is the cell phone beauty...
- She is always engaged...

208
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,856
Look at the TV anchor...

209
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,054
I hate their silly slang language...

210
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,088
She is a billionaire's daughter...

211
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,091
May be not beautiful...

212
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:21,465
What qualities do you want in her?

213
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,867
Still you aren't clear about your girl?

214
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,834
Before you could find her...

215
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:34,237
you will 101 years old...

216
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:53,520
When in public,
she must address me as hubby...

217
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:57,386
In privacy, she must call me hey boy...

218
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:02,261
When I'm naughty,
she must rap on my head...

219
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:06,267
When I'm tired,
she must caress me...

220
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,466
A little anger...

221
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,669
A little softhearted...

222
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,871
A little selfishness...

223
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,107
She must posses all these qualities...

224
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:23,449
I need a princess who could
make me understand myself...

225
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,320
Yes, I'm telling you the truth.

226
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,994
You have to come to India soon.

227
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,494
But he won't.
- Shut up.

228
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,465
I'll do a special make up on that day.
You must pay me Rs. 5000.

229
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,301
Why do I need a make up on his arrival?

230
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,836
You must look good in the video.

231
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,530
It would be betteryou don't
do the make up.

232
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,810
Madam, you must hike my salary.

233
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,875
Has Bujji raised her make up charges?

234
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,480
Work load increases when one more
person adds up to the family.

235
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,810
Nowadays, the girls are very fast.
-Yes. Superfast.

236
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,350
They address their husbands as hey...

237
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,984
The girls are very dangerous.

238
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,722
The other day, I gave lift to a girl.

239
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,426
She put her hand on my shoulders

240
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,253
and said "Will you give me lift everyday"
Same time & same place.

241
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:44,499
Selecting a good girl from that
lot is not a mean job.

242
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,098
Selecting a girl?
- Take a look.

243
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,773
She is so cute.

244
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,575
We discussed about it just a week back.

245
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,076
Not a week.

246
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,704
We took 6 months to find alliances.

247
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,681
And it took a week to chose
the best from that lot.

248
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,785
I know what to do & when to do.

249
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,079
We're going to see the girl tomorrow.

250
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,452
Mother, why marriage so soon?

251
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,662
Why is he scared of marriage?

252
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:16,564
Tell him.

253
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,432
You are married. I'm married.
And we all are happy.

254
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,400
It's a good alliance.

255
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,405
They feel very lucky to get our alliance.

256
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,605
I think 100 times to take
a decision in my business.

257
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,441
Won't I think 1000 times
about his marriage?

258
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:31,647
Yes, uncle.

259
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,280
Is he in love with any girl?

260
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:37,956
Nothing like that.

261
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,381
Then, what is your problem?

262
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,124
Give me a reason why you
don't want to marry.

263
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,223
Be friendly with me.

264
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:49,862
Say something.

265
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,634
Say what?
- Go.

266
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,540
Uncle...
- I want to talk to you.

267
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,232
Yourfather said you are creating
lot of problems at home.

268
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,239
Meet me later.

269
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,375
You went like a bravado.

270
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,946
Shut up. He will tell you what to do.

271
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,319
Why are you so silent?

272
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:10,385
I'm keep on talking.

273
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,088
Give us a chance to say something.

274
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,259
So, that's it.

275
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,786
We are going to see the girl tomorrow.

276
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:18,925
Sure uncle.

277
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,997
See you.
-We are finished.

278
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,665
Siddhu is Aravind's son.

279
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:29,733
Isn't that enough?

280
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:30,970
If not your son,

281
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,871
I'll get my daughter married
to anyone of your son.

282
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,103
They said it was about seeing the girl,

283
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,749
but they are talking about marriage.

284
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,577
Don't you understand?
Match fixing!

285
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,665
Greetings.
- Come & sit here.

286
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,293
Sit. We have no formalities.

287
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,728
I've 3 daughters including
my daughter-in-law.

288
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,834
You will be my 4th daughter. Sit.

289
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:02,903
Is she okay?

290
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,006
Don't think too much.

291
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:06,971
Select one of the two fingers.

292
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,338
Surprised?

293
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,847
Generally, you are asked to select
one of the two fingers.

294
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,878
This is yourfather's style.

295
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,014
You have no choice.

296
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,182
You must select one.

297
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,116
Forget about choice.
Be positive.

298
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,891
I feel she is the one foryou.

299
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,360
Try talking to her.

300
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,059
Our presence might be embarrassing to them.

301
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,595
They might want to talk in private.

302
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,697
My son has no such formalities...

303
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:38,934
Go & talk to her.

304
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:46,940
Sit down.

305
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,281
It's alright.

306
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:49,751
Please sit.

307
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:50,881
It's alright.

308
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:53,849
My name is Siddharth.

309
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,524
Everyone calls me Siddhu.
- My fathertold me.

310
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:58,993
My qualification...?

311
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,323
My fathertold me that you've finished B.E.

312
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,059
My job...

313
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,405
My fathertold me that you're jobless now.

314
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,875
And what about you?

315
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,171
My father brought me up
in a traditional way.

316
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:17,610
I didn't mean that.

317
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,113
Friends, love...

318
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,617
I was told that such things
aren't good for ourfamilies.

319
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,255
...my fathertold me.

320
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,053
Anything about me?

321
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,052
My fathertold me that
I'm very lucky to marry you.

322
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,966
What else did you fathertell you?

323
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,434
He told me to offer prayers
to God to fix this alliance.

324
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:41,605
Go ahead & offer.

325
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,181
I must thank you for
accepting our alliance.

326
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,179
You are a fun loving person.

327
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,551
He too has lot of energy.

328
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,411
Did you speak to her?

329
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:00,921
What do you say?

330
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,554
I've given the best to my son till now.

331
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,088
And even now also,
I'm giving him your daughter.

332
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:12,760
Subbalakshmi, the only daughter
of Kakarla Koteshwar Rao

333
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:20,944
is engaged to Siddharth,
son of Addala Aravind.

334
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,006
Exchange the proposals.

335
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,629
Everything is over.

336
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,062
All my dreams are shattered.

337
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,707
I agree that your marriage part is over.

338
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,703
Leave your careerto me.
I will make you go mad.

339
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,011
I will kill you.

340
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,518
My fathertold me about yourfamily.

341
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,148
I'm very lucky to marry you.

342
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,049
She is not the right girl for me.

343
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,664
Okay. I'm not the right guy for her.

344
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:13,725
You're right.

345
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,131
Siddhu, you are doing too much.

346
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,833
Have 2 pegs.

347
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:19,694
You said 2...

348
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:26,537
Siddhu, don't feel bad.

349
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,012
Your life will be fine.

350
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,639
Everything is foryour good.

351
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,015
You are a good boy.

352
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,073
Good boy?

353
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:33,508
Am I a good boy?

354
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,011
Am I a good boy?

355
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:38,454
I drink.

356
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:39,951
Am I a good boy?

357
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,485
I'm a rowdy.
- No Siddhu.

358
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:44,591
I'm a rogue.

359
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:46,288
I'm a scoundrel.

360
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,227
You are drunk. Go home.

361
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,164
No. I won't go to that house.

362
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,136
I'll stand on my own legs.

363
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,014
Keep your legs inside.
You'll lose them.

364
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,981
I've lost my life.
My legs mean nothing to me.

365
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,048
Let them go.

366
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,390
What is his problem?

367
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,053
Who is he to decide about my life?

368
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:18,492
What did you say?

369
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:19,986
Don't I have courage?

370
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:21,724
Don't I have guts?

371
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,834
Ask him to come here.

372
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,602
I will tell him that I'm not
interested in this marriage.

373
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,931
Ask him to come here.

374
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,972
Call him.

375
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,406
A bit louder.
He will come.

376
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,876
He is drunk.
-We have come to your house.

377
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,011
Couldn't you tell me this before?

378
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,619
Do I smell liquor?

379
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,002
Didn't I tell you that he will score a goal?

380
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,235
Have milk.

381
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:04,772
Will you have dinner?

382
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,440
Siddhu, come & sit here.

383
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,503
Atleast have milk.
- No mom.

384
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:10,743
Did you drink?

385
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,951
Father...!
- Did you drink milk outside?

386
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,208
Yes father.

387
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,985
How many times to tell you,
it is not healthy.

388
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,584
I won't drink hereafter.

389
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,559
He looks upset forthe past 2 days.
Ask him what is the reason.

390
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,730
What happened?

391
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,156
Nothing.

392
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,469
He is smiling & very happy.
Why do you worry?

393
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:33,838
Will you watch the match?

394
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:35,904
No. Go & sleep.
It might get late.

395
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,773
Look at those girls.

396
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,938
The Gods are here.
- Go & pray foryour husbands.

397
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,050
Are you sending us away to ogle at girls?

398
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,049
Oh no! How could you say
that in a temple?

399
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,616
She looks very beautiful, ah?

400
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,488
Forget what has happened?

401
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:56,752
We married guys ogle at girls.

402
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,518
You are still a bachelor.

403
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:58,696
Why are you inciting him?

404
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,064
He'll start lecturing about
character & so on.

405
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,095
Even now I stand by what I said.

406
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,398
To fall in love, you don't need to
look beautiful or have good physique.

407
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:04,168
You need to have a good character.

408
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:10,703
I butt against the girl's head.

409
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:12,702
Will love spark in me immediately?

410
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,644
Hey you checked shirt!

411
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,411
You...come here.

412
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:25,649
You butted & simply walking away.

413
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,415
Didn't I say "Sorry"?

414
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,154
Won't I get horns if you say sorry?

415
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:30,694
Horns?

416
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:31,519
Yes.

417
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,058
If you butt once, you will get horns.
Do you know that?

418
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:38,193
You don't know that, ah?

419
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:40,433
Okay. Butt again.

420
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:45,108
Butt. I've to pray to god.

421
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:15,430
Come Siddhu, let's go.

422
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,469
Siddhu, let's go.

423
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:20,639
Hey you checked shirt!

424
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,524
Why are you pushing me?

425
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,592
Hey boy! Come in the line.

426
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:50,165
Come...

427
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,713
Why am I offering this without
making a wish to God?

428
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,343
What should I wish for?

429
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,779
I cracked a joke to an idiot
in my college.

430
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,349
He didn't laugh.
Instead he teased me.

431
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,322
He must meet with an accident
without getting hurt.

432
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:14,325
Did anyone see the jar?

433
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,157
You give it to others.

434
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,667
Wow! God offerings.

435
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,236
Give it to me.
I'll eat everything.

436
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:26,800
Will you alone eat this?
- Is it yours?

437
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,468
You tell him...

438
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,213
Siddhu, you tell him.

439
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,140
You shouldn't eat everything.

440
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,408
It's not right.

441
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,313
You missed her?

442
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,317
What now?

443
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:42,852
You friends are there for me to find her.
-You...!

444
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,493
That's her house.

445
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,593
We searched nook & corner
to find her house.

446
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:48,696
When will she come?

447
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,261
How many times will you put
that question to us,

448
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,468
like Ganguly waiting for a place
in the Indian Cricket team.

449
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:54,395
She will come.

450
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,029
But when?

451
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,366
Wonder how many are there in her house.

452
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,235
She needs time to get ready.

453
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,176
She's a girl and she must do
all the household work.

454
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,072
I'm exhausted doing all
the household work.

455
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,580
Her dress, college bag is ready.

456
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,311
Before she finishes her bath...

457
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,518
Did you again bath in cold water?

458
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,621
Calls himself a boxer!

459
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,759
But shouts when hot waterfalls on him.

460
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,489
Comment about me but not my boxing.

461
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,696
You don't understand things
that you don't know.

462
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:26,928
I can understand anything.

463
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:30,332
Look at my medals, trophies
and my well built body.

464
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,075
Took a couple of photos wearing shots,

465
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,746
produced a few fake certificates
and got a job in the temple.

466
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,946
How did they offer job to a drunkard?

467
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:39,244
Which one is good?

468
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:41,285
Green.

469
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,451
Then, why did you ask my suggestion?

470
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,291
I'm coming.

471
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,091
Are you Mr. Kanaka Rao?
-Yes.

472
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,496
The auspicious hour is on
Friday at 10 am.- Is it?

473
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,499
Can we have the bride seeing
ceremony on that day?

474
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:01,703
Bride seeing ceremony?

475
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,929
Didn't Hasini tell you about this?

476
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,004
Hasini...

477
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,344
Have you arranged the bride seeing
ceremony by yourself?

478
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,207
It's foryou & not for me.

479
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:11,481
Me?

480
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,415
My Mathematics lecturer.

481
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,049
Her husband is dead just like my mother.

482
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:21,992
If you both get married, I'll be happy
both at home & in college.

483
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,387
You are talking to much.

484
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:24,725
I'm going to college.

485
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,894
That window will not open.
I've nailed it.

486
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:31,298
Why did you do that?

487
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,572
You see through the window
till I catch the bus.

488
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,405
If someone ogles at me,
you pick up fight with him.

489
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:38,774
I'm fed up with you.

490
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,275
You are still a little girl.
I do all that foryour safety.

491
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,908
I'm not a little girl.

492
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,480
It's called suspicion & not safety.

493
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,820
I doubt the boys not you.

494
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,215
These boys are...

495
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,054
Why did you stop? Go ahead.

496
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,255
I shouldn't say bad words infront
of my daughter. Go.

497
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,956
These boys give you love letters
and later...

498
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:04,891
What?

499
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:09,934
Why didn't you come out to play cricket?
-We have exams today.

500
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,778
Write your exams well.

501
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:30,920
Don't you recognise me?

502
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,293
Oh you! What is it?

503
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,926
We met in the temple the other day.

504
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,698
We didn't talk much on that day.
- So what?

505
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,570
If possible, we can talk,

506
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,107
and if you agree for a cup of coffee.

507
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,310
We can discuss about anything.

508
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,642
What happened?
- Leave it.

509
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:54,341
What happened?

510
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,614
Leave it I say.
- Tell me what happened.

511
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:57,578
She called me idiot.

512
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,456
Called you an idiot?

513
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:00,786
It is you who shout at girls.

514
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:04,826
How could she call you an idiot?
- That's our college bus. Let's go.

515
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:05,720
How many times to tell you?

516
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,363
Why are you after me?
Won't you listen to me?

517
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,625
Though uninterested in studies,
he still teaches us. I'm just like him.

518
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:14,632
You were after her.
She abused you.

519
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:15,863
Why drag me into this now?

520
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,699
Is this how all students behave?

521
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,203
You all are not students.

522
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,613
Students of 2001 batch were the best.

523
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:27,543
There was a boy named Siddhu.

524
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,643
He respects lecturers.
He was very studious.

525
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,148
He disliked girls.

526
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:33,521
He hated love.

527
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:34,990
He was a perfect student.

528
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,285
I can still remember his face.

529
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:38,051
Hi Mr. Lucky!

530
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,328
Who called me?
- Over here.

531
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,599
Hi Siddhu! When did you come?

532
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:43,892
I was just talking about you.

533
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,533
What brought you here? Any doubts?

534
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,259
Yes sir.

535
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:49,300
I saw a girl in a blue dress
coming this way.

536
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,834
Stop laughing.

537
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,045
It must be about some books.

538
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:55,712
No sir.

539
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,138
I invited herfor a coffee.

540
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,406
She chided me.

541
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,859
What's up? What did you call me?

542
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:11,720
Idiot?

543
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:13,828
I met you in the temple.
So, I wanted to meet you again.

544
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,792
Will you conclude that
I'm trying to ogle at you?

545
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,830
I'm not like that.

546
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,061
I'm from this college.
Inquire about me.

547
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,240
Just because we met in the temple,

548
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:24,733
doesn't mean you can come to
my house & invite me for a coffee.

549
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,006
What if my father had seen you?

550
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:26,904
Do you have a father?

551
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,644
What question is that?

552
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,780
Actually...

553
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,750
Everything is fine with boys.

554
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,715
But girls have many problems.

555
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,086
Sorry.

556
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:44,286
Is that it?

557
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:47,690
What else do you want?

558
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,227
If possible, we can talk,

559
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,401
and if you agree for a cup of coffee.

560
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:05,349
How did I agree for coffee without
knowing much about you?

561
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:06,709
How did you agree?

562
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,518
To decide about your character.

563
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:12,317
Where shall we go?

564
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:14,482
Minerva.

565
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,690
Where is it?
- Secunderabad.

566
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,028
Secunderabad...?

567
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,092
Oh my God! There is no driver.

568
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,405
Come & sit.

569
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,103
I missed it again.

570
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,214
Come & sit.

571
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,483
What is your name?

572
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:51,423
What do you do?

573
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,755
I haven't told my name yet.

574
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,027
Tell me.
- Siddhu.

575
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:57,100
Nice name.

576
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:57,993
Ask me my name?

577
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:00,194
What is your name?

578
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:01,830
Ha..ha..Hasini.

579
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,135
Nice name, ah?

580
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,038
How old are you?

581
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:08,234
2 years olderthan you.

582
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,345
Then, why are you wearing such a shirt?

583
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,278
What?
- It's not nice.

584
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,080
You look aged.

585
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,288
Don't I?
- Don't I!

586
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,024
You wanted to talk before having coffee.

587
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,663
Will you talk & shall I?
- Okay. I will talk.

588
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:31,999
I will tell you a joke.

589
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,563
It didn't die because the ant
was wearing a helmet.

590
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:37,833
The joke is over.

591
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,566
Shall we get down from the running bus?

592
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,942
Come. Get down.

593
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,848
It's alright. Jump.

594
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,787
Siddhu, Minerva is on this side.

595
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,124
Here?-You want to have
a good coffee, don't you?

596
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,128
Sultan bhai...
- Hasini dear, I'm coming.

597
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,430
You must come here to have good coffee.

598
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:06,535
Didn't I tell you that Dravid will
score 100 against Pakistan?

599
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:08,134
He is Bhai.
- Greetings.

600
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,100
Who is he?
- My guest.

601
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,499
2 coffees.

602
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,176
2 coffee.
- Special. Clean the cups.- Okay.

603
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,276
You say something...

604
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:23,919
Since we said at the same time,
we'll have guests at home.

605
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:28,347
Do you believe in these
horns & guests' things?

606
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,150
They are nice.

607
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,053
Where do you learn all such things?

608
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,326
From my neighbourhood children.

609
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:34,820
Children?
-Yes.

610
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:35,862
Hot coffee.

611
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,092
How are you Chiru?
- Superb.

612
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,545
Have you decided about my character?

613
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,576
Idiot.

614
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:04,352
What else did she say?

615
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,758
She called me an idiot.

616
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,555
Again?

617
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,230
She only called me an idiot.

618
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,395
Just sit down.

619
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,002
Are you serious?

620
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,230
I don't know what it is.

621
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,207
Fortime being, I'm an idiot.

622
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,646
That's all.

623
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:59,182
When lovers said that they dream
with their eyes wide open...

624
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,912
I thought they were mad...

625
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,813
But now...

626
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:11,219
When lovers say that they
could see moon in the day...

627
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,993
I thought they were crazy...

628
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,791
But now...

629
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:27,008
Shahjahan built Taj Mahal for his love.
I thought he was brainsick...

630
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:31,411
When people said that there is
nothing greaterthan love...

631
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:35,174
I thought they were cheating...

632
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:43,286
Many things have changed
in a short span of time...

633
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:51,361
Even I got drenched
in this love rain...

634
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:35,368
When someone said that he had lived
all his life in her memories...

635
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:39,515
and conquered heaven,
I yelled at him...

636
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,748
But now...

637
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:47,657
When I was told that salary isn't enough
to buy her greeting cards & pay phone bills...

638
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,492
I laughed at them...

639
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,758
But now...

640
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:55,593
When people write in the air...

641
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,030
I thought they were sick...

642
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:03,638
When people stammer often...

643
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:07,332
I thought it was a hangover...

644
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:15,514
Today I found that it was love...

645
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:23,556
Even I got drenched
in this love rain...

646
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:09,838
What starts in eyes & roots in heart
and makes you go wild...

647
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,701
But I didn't believe.

648
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:12,876
But now...

649
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:19,680
There would be someone born foryou...

650
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,647
But I didn't agree...

651
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:22,876
But now...

652
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:29,290
When I was told there exists
an exotic world of love...

653
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,188
I disagreed...

654
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:39,461
Why did I alone miss this joy & happiness?

655
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:47,536
I've never been so happy before...

656
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:55,751
I got drenched myself
in this love rain...

657
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,696
Where shall we go? Ice cream...

658
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:51,405
Siddhu, you are taking a girl out.
Try to be descent.

659
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:11,928
How come you are here?

660
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:14,894
Got some work?
-Yes.

661
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,930
Finish it fast. We'll go out.

662
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:26,076
Why is she behaving like that?

663
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:36,576
Let's go.

664
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:39,754
Is this the work you mentioned about?

665
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,356
Where shall we go now?

666
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,924
Pani poori?
- I will tell the place.

667
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,455
She took me 10 kms. away to have coffee.

668
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:49,462
Gandipet Durga Dhaba.

669
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:51,763
Why go so farto have pani poori?

670
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,100
Brother Shankar is very near by.

671
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:56,264
Brother Shankar...?

672
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,634
How are you Hasini?
-Very fine, Brother Shankar.

673
00:42:59,043 --> 00:42:59,634
Hello Brother Shankar.

674
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:01,969
Who is he?
- Friend.

675
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,811
2 plates.
- Special.

676
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:06,440
Special...?

677
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:08,575
They will clean the plates.

678
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:11,220
Take it, sir.

679
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,355
Thank you.
- Take it, dear.

680
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,793
Did you buy cell phone?
-Yes. 2 days back.

681
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:19,928
Why didn't you give me your number?

682
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,320
You never asked me.

683
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,727
You must give it before they ask for it.

684
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,065
Don't you have a cell phone?

685
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,674
I was offered a cell phone
if I become the company's MD.

686
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:34,872
I said "No".

687
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,072
How should I call you?
Ring-a-roses or Ring-a-ring-a-roses?

688
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,309
Ring-a-ring-a-roses...?!

689
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:43,176
Don't you know what it is?

690
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,218
I will call your number and
cut the call twice.

691
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,754
Answerthe call on the third ring.

692
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,725
It's an Universal Youth Code
to avoid problems.

693
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:52,162
Oh Is it?

694
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,126
We used to call it differently.

695
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:55,888
As what?

696
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,257
1 2 3.

697
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:58,762
1 2 3...?

698
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:03,006
We had many more code languages.

699
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:04,472
Our batch was very good.

700
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:05,739
We used to enjoy a lot.

701
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:06,838
Really?
-Yes.

702
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,944
But I heard that you were
big bore in your batch.

703
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:10,470
Who said that?

704
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,805
I had inquired about you in the college.

705
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,117
You used to stay away from girls.

706
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:16,910
You never spoke to girls.

707
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,145
You must like someone to talk to him.

708
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,687
But you are good to me.

709
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:22,924
What did you like in me?

710
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,186
You do what you like.

711
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:26,255
I like that quality.

712
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,488
Yes, you're right.

713
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:33,129
I have so many friends.

714
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:37,395
They will have a cup of coffee with me.
That's all.

715
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,342
But no one had ever said this.

716
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:42,077
You said it right.

717
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,342
I will call you whenever I go out. Okay.

718
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:46,542
When will you call me?

719
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:47,774
When!?

720
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,879
You neither have to go to college
nor attend any classes.

721
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,323
You have no work.

722
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:55,749
I will call you.

723
00:44:58,162 --> 00:44:59,060
Make it fast.

724
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:00,654
You've been doing this for an hour.

725
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,058
It's almost over.

726
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,924
You talk as if you are very busy.

727
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:05,032
You have no work.

728
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,773
Answerthe phone.
You are free, aren't you?

729
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:16,970
Do I have to do everything in this house?

730
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:27,221
Calling from ICICI BANK.
- It's forfather.

731
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:29,187
Siddhu, it's me.

732
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,220
You...! Tell me.

733
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:34,456
I'm going out shopping.
I thought of taking you with me.

734
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,397
Shopping? Which place?

735
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,202
Sultan Bazaar.
You are free, aren't you?

736
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:41,734
I'm very busy.

737
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:44,572
We will come back in an hour.

738
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,504
Didn't I tell you that I'm busy?
- Really?

739
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,505
Okay. He will be free.
I'll go with him.

740
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:53,512
Who is he?
- Rajesh.

741
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:56,150
Rajesh...is it?

742
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:57,884
Where are you?

743
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,014
Friend's house.
-Who is he?- Rajesh ...

744
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,059
Siddhu, you said you were busy.

745
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,458
Yes, I did say.

746
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,835
Are you both friends?

747
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:15,429
Yourfriend is my friend too.

748
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,706
He asked me where he
could get used books.

749
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:30,652
Go straight.
Take 3rd left, 4th shop.

750
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:33,116
Thank you
- No need of thanks. It's my duty.

751
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,386
He said this 10 times.
- Bye..

752
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,426
He said that I look like an angel
in this white dress.

753
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:40,554
I don't like it.

754
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,795
Why?
- I hate white colour.

755
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,394
It looks good.

756
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:48,669
You said you were coming
here with Rajesh.

757
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,464
Don't talk about him.
He is a useless fellow.

758
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:51,463
What happened?

759
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:54,938
He invited to a flop movie.

760
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:58,673
What are you going to buy now?

761
00:46:58,882 --> 00:46:59,576
Kaleidoscope.

762
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,442
Kaleidoscope?

763
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:04,781
I asked Bablu to give it to me once.
But he didn't.

764
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,022
So, I decided to buy one.

765
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:08,149
Don't worry.

766
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,015
I know this place very well.
I will get it foryou.

767
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,219
Too tough. It is so crowded...

768
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,354
Didn't I tell you I will get it?

769
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:15,431
I will get it foryou.

770
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:38,487
Let's go.

771
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:41,454
I told you won't get it, didn't I?

772
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,459
Wow! Got it?

773
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:45,824
How much?

774
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:46,958
I didn't pay anything.

775
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,756
You stole it?

776
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,530
What's the time now there?

777
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:55,762
Is it?

778
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,597
Here it is 9 am now.

779
00:47:58,141 --> 00:47:59,904
Chintu & Bantu are still sleeping.

780
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:04,743
Stupid phone.

781
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,675
It gets cut when I want to talk
an important matter.

782
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,516
You reduced the telephone bill.

783
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,520
Why are you increasing it?

784
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:14,957
Go.

785
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:16,559
Go.

786
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:19,958
Bujji, Sathi wants make up.

787
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,220
Oh my God!

788
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:40,915
We are calling from Andhra Bank.

789
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,517
Seetha, how are you?

790
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,653
Seetha?
- Tell me.

791
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:45,752
Do you have Maths class today?

792
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,418
Yes, I do have.

793
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:48,658
So, I will wait in the bus stop.

794
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,123
You wait. But I might be late.
-Why?

795
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,125
You can come just like that.

796
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,661
But I have to jump through the window.

797
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,730
I'm going to office.

798
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,160
Don't forget to take your lunch.
- Bye father.

799
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:01,866
Bye father!

800
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,073
I hear songs.

801
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,036
Which channel?

802
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:05,832
Mummy TV.

803
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,667
When did it started airing?

804
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:11,937
It's not TV. My mom is singing.
Do you like to hear?

805
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:13,116
Sure.

806
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:19,819
If you wish to be with me,
I would take you in my embrace.

807
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:25,819
Will I say no if you wish to come?

808
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:29,123
Nice?

809
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:33,295
She was superb.
Your mom has great future.

810
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,801
My friend says that you have great future.

811
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:38,735
I'll be waiting foryou.

812
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:41,137
Did you air my voice?

813
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:45,475
You never listen to me.
You really have a great future.

814
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:46,410
Really?

815
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:53,319
It's pleasing to see you so happy.

816
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:55,150
If I have some problem,
you're there to solve it.

817
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:56,659
What problem?

818
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:00,655
I mean you are there to make me happy.

819
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:03,999
Okay. I have an important meeting.
See you later.

820
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:06,499
Have breakfast.
- No

821
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:10,833
Siddhu, I have headache.
You go to the office.

822
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:12,340
Give this file to Chari,

823
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,567
tell him to check the statements
and send them to audit.

824
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:18,679
There are corrections in S.S. Construction's plan.
Correct them & send it.

825
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,848
Your brother might come late from Bombay.

826
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:24,845
I told Venkat about the iron material.

827
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,023
He is mindless.
He always does the opposite.

828
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:28,782
Look into it too.
- Okay father.

829
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,016
What are you doing?

830
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:33,253
Will you go to office in this dress?

831
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:41,200
Where is Chari uncle?

832
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:42,697
Welcome Siddhu.

833
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,699
We have to send the accounts
statement to Auditor.

834
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:48,309
Father called me just now.
The statements are being printed.

835
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:50,943
You can go to your cabin.
Just sign the papers.

836
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:52,874
Father...

837
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,222
We have to dispatch the designs
to clients immediately.

838
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:00,390
Yourfathertold us.

839
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,489
But there are corrections in it.

840
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:06,889
I have corrected it and
informed yourfather just now.

841
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:21,237
Okay sir. Yes sir.

842
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:22,407
Greetings sir.

843
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:24,312
Was it my father?
-Yes sir.

844
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:26,341
Did he tell you what to do?
-Yes sir.

845
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:27,579
Go ahead.

846
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,531
I can understand yourfeelings.

847
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,101
He is always like that.

848
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:58,941
Do your job.
Try not to act smart.

849
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,118
If you talk about him again,
you may have to find another job.

850
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:11,453
What happened to the loan?

851
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,632
Very good. Excellent.

852
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:23,964
Anyone will sanction loan on
seeing this project report.

853
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:27,306
Fine. What is the security?

854
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:28,970
You must pledge something.

855
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:30,972
We have nothing.

856
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,645
How do I look like to you?

857
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,649
Tell me...actually...

858
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:41,481
We need a security to sanction
a huge loan amount.

859
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:46,321
Come with yourfather.
We will discuss about it.

860
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,498
I will get his signature as a guarantor.

861
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:51,330
What did I say now?

862
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:54,003
Since I look like an idiot,
you approached me for a loan.

863
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,838
Asking for a security has upset you, ah?

864
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,841
Rs. 2.5 millions is nothing to him.
His father can give him billions.

865
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:02,011
Oh really! Who is his father?

866
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,180
Mr. Aravind, M.D.,
Ragasudha constructions.

867
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:07,839
You could have told me this earlier.
- Please sit.- Sit.

868
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:12,949
You could have asked yourfather
to give me a call.

869
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:18,520
So, that is not possible either, right?

870
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:23,859
Is seems someone did Medicine
and opened a medical shop.

871
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,869
When yourfather is the M.D.
of a big construction company,

872
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,628
why do you want to take
loan for Rs. 2.5 millions?

873
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:30,863
and start a new construction company.

874
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:36,637
I want to be myself.

875
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,714
You have touched my heart.

876
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:44,545
Keep in touch. I will try.

877
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:49,217
Oh no!

878
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:56,726
I will win.

879
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,728
Is everything finished?
- It will be over.

880
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:03,139
But I was told that it'll be over.
- Office work is finished.

881
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:05,233
You play.

882
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:07,902
They have been playing since morning.

883
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:10,143
I'm coming...

884
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,247
Will you play now?

885
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:18,149
No. He will play everyone's game.

886
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,422
Come Siddhu.
Let's finish off the game.

887
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,423
Come.
-You pocket the black.

888
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:30,524
Only 3 more coins. The bet is for Rs. 1000.
Please pocket them all.

889
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,437
Stop. What are you trying to pocket?

890
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:43,105
Why don't you try this one?
Keep the strikerthere & slowly hit it.

891
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:45,109
Nice.

892
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:50,445
You play. Pocket the red coin.

893
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,449
Just a minute.
Powder will make it easy.

894
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:58,620
Hit straight.

895
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:01,790
Red is ours.

896
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:09,461
Don't delay. Keep it here & hit.

897
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:12,635
Have confidence.

898
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:23,309
Play. Not from here.

899
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:29,089
He pocketed all coins.

900
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,487
Your son plays so well.
- No.

901
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:32,992
Don't believe him.
He will lose wantonly.

902
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,994
It's cheating. We won.

903
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:43,105
Are you upset?

904
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,601
Actually, what really happened is...

905
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,276
Sorry? For what?

906
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:57,514
You must have waited for me.

907
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,120
So, you didn't come then.

908
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,027
But why?

909
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:06,695
I kept waiting foryou.

910
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:08,855
People wondered why I was waiting there.

911
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,134
I was caught forthe first time.

912
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:15,700
Try to understand.
- Caught?

913
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:20,938
Like always, ljumped out of
the window to meet you.

914
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:22,536
My principal was...

915
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:31,713
Stop laughing.

916
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:34,219
When happened then?

917
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:39,051
My lecturertaught me all the lessons.

918
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,906
She is a devil.
What happened next is...

919
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:54,235
It's enough.- Please listen to me...
- I can't laugh anymore.

920
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:57,413
Please listen to me.
-You can narrate me about the rest later.

921
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,173
I can't laugh anymore.
Hang the phone.

922
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:02,878
You hang the phone.
-You first.

923
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,518
You hang the phone.

924
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:07,916
Why are you so serious today?

925
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:09,857
I never laughed so much in my life.

926
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:13,022
I never worried so much in my life.

927
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,793
How could a girl handle
so many problems?

928
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,523
Why do you hate Maths?

929
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:21,534
What question is that!
Look. It is full of problems.

930
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:29,774
You leave now.

931
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:32,438
I will stay here. It's alright.

932
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:34,876
I say leave now.

933
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,046
What's wrong with you?
- I said go.

934
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,047
Do you know who we are?

935
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:43,055
Your seniors.

936
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,560
Don't you know SVC salute?

937
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,657
Stop it. It's enough.

938
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:52,725
Mangina Seenu.

939
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:54,569
Are you KD Mangina Seenu?

940
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,401
I saw.
-Where?

941
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,904
"KD Mangina Seenu loves Manjula"

942
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:01,234
It's all overthe college walls.

943
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:02,502
Still there?

944
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,408
Shut up.

945
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:07,242
Hasini, you are getting late to class.
Come, I will drop you.

946
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,908
Wait. We need to talk.
We have doubts.

947
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,755
Why should I be here?
-Will you stay here if he tells you?

948
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,750
Sure, I will.

949
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,253
Poor Siddhu.
He waited for me all day.

950
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:22,655
Is that what you told her? Good.

951
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:23,924
What do you mean?

952
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:26,600
You know something.
He was with us all day.

953
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:28,930
We went to Bank to start a own business.

954
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:30,604
Find out from him.

955
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:34,265
Did you lie to me? Did you?

956
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,046
Don't talk to me.

957
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:44,609
Say Sorry. Athousand times.
- Sorry a thousand times.

958
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:48,623
Come.

959
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:52,453
I'm a fool.

960
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:56,629
You were busy asking for
a loan in the bank.

961
00:58:56,833 --> 00:59:00,633
But I thought you had no work.

962
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,134
I'm sorry Siddhu.

963
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:09,979
Hello Mr.Senior, is the line cleared?

964
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:13,077
Mr. Senior, your mom's song was great.

965
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,879
Shall we go to Gandipet on Sunday?

966
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:18,547
Stop there.

967
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:21,314
How did they know about all this?

968
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,157
They are my friends. So, I told them.

969
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:25,491
Have you told them everything?

970
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:27,893
That bus incident...?

971
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,092
Sultan Bazaar Kaleidoscope...?

972
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,165
I told them.
-And that toilet incident...?

973
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:33,560
I forgot.

974
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:37,664
Go & tell them. Go.

975
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:39,671
Don't you have any secrets?

976
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:41,343
Don't you have anything personal?

977
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:42,408
What did I do?

978
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,842
They want to know what is
there between us.

979
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:48,274
What is there between us?
There is nothing.

980
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:49,917
Tell them that there is nothing. Go.

981
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:09,095
What?

982
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:11,705
I wasn't brought up well.
-What?

983
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:13,705
I wasn't brought up well.

984
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:21,376
Thank god! Bye Siddhu.
Bye uncles.- Uncles...?

985
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,552
You are married, aren't you?
- Married?

986
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:27,479
We will meet tomorrow evening.

987
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:31,954
What's happening!

988
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:36,387
You didn't scold her even when
she told them your secrets.

989
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:43,964
But...
- Tell me...

990
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:45,401
Let's meet in the party today evening.

991
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:53,580
Say it again.

992
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:57,742
Though you shouted at her,
she kept quiet. It means love.

993
01:00:57,954 --> 01:00:59,251
I believe your words.

994
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:01,420
Everything is fine. But I...

995
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:05,526
No ifs & buts. Congratulate him.

996
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:07,091
Congratulations boy.

997
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,098
Stop it.

998
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:14,428
Congratulate me.

999
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:17,765
For what reason?
- He made a girl fall...

1000
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:19,441
Then, take herto a hospital.

1001
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:22,777
He made herfall in love.
- Love?

1002
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:26,107
Then we'll congratulate you twice.

1003
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:35,122
You were about to hit me.

1004
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,888
Okay. Congratulate me.

1005
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:45,464
Why isn't he saying anything?
- He doesn't know the reason.

1006
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:46,963
He made a girl fall in love.

1007
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:55,236
Wow! What a girl she is!
I must worship his father.

1008
01:01:57,513 --> 01:01:59,481
Say "Congratulations Siddhu".

1009
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,819
You won't.
Because you are also a father.

1010
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:14,320
Go. Please go.
- He will abuse his father when he is drunk.

1011
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:16,655
Why talk about him now?

1012
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,158
Why talk about him now?

1013
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:19,592
What can he do?

1014
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:22,430
Ask him to come here.
I will wait for him. Idiot...

1015
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,505
Why are you still standing here?
Didn't I tell you to leave?

1016
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:30,509
Ask him to leave.
Do you have a license?

1017
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:34,848
I have lifetime license.

1018
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:36,510
Do you want to know what it is?

1019
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:43,018
Stop your shit & send him.
- Go. Get out.

1020
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:50,532
Leave now. Don't you understand.

1021
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:57,467
Such rogues scare me to
send my daughter out.

1022
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:00,941
Come.
-Where?

1023
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:02,202
Come I say.
-What happened?

1024
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:03,537
Come.
-What happened, Hasini?

1025
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:04,371
What is this?

1026
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,545
When everyone was talking
about you in the college...

1027
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:12,050
Are you blind? Look at my hair.
Draw properly.

1028
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:13,049
You mean the rings.

1029
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:17,292
Overthere.

1030
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:23,792
Will Hasini look dull?
Always smiling.

1031
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:26,401
That's it.

1032
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:27,794
You don't even know this.

1033
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,632
What about love then?
-Ask her.

1034
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:34,102
What are you doing?
-A small fight.

1035
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,743
He drew my face on the wall.
I warned him.

1036
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:39,241
He went pale when I shouted at him.

1037
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:40,671
Why are you so dull?

1038
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,584
I got drunk last night.
- Do you drink?

1039
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:45,711
What brand?
- Old rock.

1040
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:49,091
My father's brand. Why do you drink?

1041
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:51,089
I drink to abuse my father.

1042
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:53,754
I was very happy yesterday...
- Do you abuse yourfather?

1043
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:54,926
What will you abuse?

1044
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,825
Won't you ask me the reason
for my happiness?

1045
01:03:57,066 --> 01:04:00,092
Leave it. What will you abuse?
Bad words?

1046
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:02,931
What bad words?
Please tell me 3 bad words.

1047
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:05,706
Bad words?
What's wrong with you?

1048
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:07,375
You drink & abuse yourfather.

1049
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,101
Won't I like to abuse my drunkard father?

1050
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:10,711
Just 3 bad words, Siddhu.

1051
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:14,541
Aren't you coming to the class?
-You go. I will learn bad words.

1052
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,945
Bad words? I will teach you.

1053
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:20,714
I know all bad words.
I'm the king of bad words. Tell her.

1054
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,287
Shall I talk about your shape?

1055
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:23,617
Shall I admire part by part?

1056
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:27,454
Your lips are like lollipops.
- Enough.

1057
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:31,795
Why are you getting angry?
Get lost you idiot! Macho hero!

1058
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:36,301
How dare you hit him?

1059
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,466
Stop being a hero!

1060
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:41,302
Scoundrels!

1061
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,308
Stop fighting.

1062
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:07,663
Stop beating them.
Please, stop it.

1063
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:15,337
Will you teach her bad words?
- Rajesh is my friend.

1064
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:18,512
Rajesh, he is Siddhu, our senior.

1065
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,508
Does that mean he will hit us?

1066
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:22,009
I will kill you.

1067
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:32,017
Shut up.

1068
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:36,031
I should've hit you instead.
You call everyone yourfriend.

1069
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:38,192
Saw how he spoke. Shit.

1070
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:39,265
What's my fault?

1071
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:40,867
Is being friendly with everyone a crime?

1072
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:45,207
Trusting everyone is wrong.
Everyone is not like you.

1073
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:48,468
Even I'm friendly with you.
Can I trust you?

1074
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:05,718
You're bleeding.
- Blood?

1075
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:10,724
How did you get hurt?

1076
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:17,401
Madam...

1077
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:19,631
Yes, he met with an accident.

1078
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:23,176
We are very worried.
- Mom, I am fine.

1079
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:25,404
I could see that. Sleep.

1080
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,344
Let him take rest.
- I told you to get a car instead of bike.

1081
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:29,916
Nobody listened to me.
See what has happened now.

1082
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,747
Go & find out the latest car in the market.
We will buy one today.

1083
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,427
Your brother-in-law...
-Yes...

1084
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:42,597
What happened?
- He fell somewhere.

1085
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:44,489
How?
- From the bike.

1086
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,600
Careful Siddhu.
- Even I told him to be careful.

1087
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:47,530
You talk.

1088
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:52,168
Did you see...stupid phones.

1089
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:56,168
Met with an accident?
- Hang the phone.

1090
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:11,289
I want to talk to you.

1091
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:15,052
My father asked me to talk to you.

1092
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:20,728
I heard that you met with an accident.

1093
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:22,963
Did you have medicine?

1094
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:23,866
Sister gave me.

1095
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:25,540
Juice.
- Servant gave me.

1096
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:26,969
Food.
- Motherfed me.

1097
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:31,871
I feel sleepy. Bye.

1098
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:49,994
Picked up the phone
on the first ring!

1099
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:51,096
Didn't you go to bed?

1100
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:53,162
Tell me, what is it.

1101
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:56,163
I'm going out for an ice cream.
Come Siddhu.

1102
01:07:56,605 --> 01:08:00,336
Ice cream at this hour?
Going alone?

1103
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,168
That's why I called you.

1104
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,175
I won't come. You also don't go.

1105
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:08,580
How did you father allow you to go out now?

1106
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:11,515
I gave him 4 pegs of your brand liquor.

1107
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:14,445
He won't get up till dawn.
-You also go to bed.

1108
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:16,451
You don't want me to trust everyone.

1109
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:18,124
And you wouldn't come either.

1110
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:19,361
How is this possible?

1111
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:22,030
I'm telling you not to go out
at this hour. Listen to me.

1112
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:24,593
So, you won't come, ah? I'm going.

1113
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:28,036
Go.

1114
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,044
One butter scotch.

1115
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:55,293
You said you won't come.

1116
01:08:58,534 --> 01:08:59,228
Want to eat?

1117
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:02,331
One more.
- Okay.

1118
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:05,232
Give me a small one.
I have only Rs. 10.

1119
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:08,340
Take it sir.

1120
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:12,172
You don't want ice cream?

1121
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:15,413
Give me the bigger one.
- Rs. 25.

1122
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:16,849
Get it from her.

1123
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,748
Ganesh, I'll pay you tomorrow.
- Ganesh...?

1124
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:24,024
Is he also yourfriend?

1125
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:26,685
I told you not to go
Why did you come out?

1126
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:28,420
You said you won't come.
Why did you come then?

1127
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:29,422
I will slap you...

1128
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:31,463
Poor girl...- Ganesh, please...

1129
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:34,199
How could you go when I am talking to you?

1130
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,666
Why did you call me?

1131
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:37,804
Unnecessary tension.

1132
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:39,040
Why should you get tensed?

1133
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:40,501
If something happens to you...

1134
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:41,367
What will happen?

1135
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:42,571
Don't you know?

1136
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:44,744
Listen to what I say.

1137
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:48,183
Okay. I won't come out for
ice creams at night.

1138
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:49,945
Smile once, please.

1139
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:50,818
Go.

1140
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,012
No. Ice cream at midnight?

1141
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,085
I said you can come out.

1142
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,287
Come out but do call me.

1143
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,720
I will take you out.
- Really?

1144
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:00,723
Even at 1 AM?

1145
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:05,295
We have come to your house. Go.

1146
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:06,401
Tell me.

1147
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:17,703
How will you go all alone?

1148
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:18,942
Shall I accompany you?

1149
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:07,151
I dreamt sometime ago...

1150
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:11,732
I fell in love with you somewhere...

1151
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:16,531
You're my imagination...

1152
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:21,399
You're my dream girl...

1153
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:25,942
My heart said you're mine...

1154
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:07,582
When someone asks me
the sweetest thing in my life...

1155
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:12,617
The first thing that would strike
my mind is your name...

1156
01:12:13,228 --> 01:12:18,359
When someone asks me
the happiest thing in my life...

1157
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:21,870
It would be the path you go...

1158
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:26,937
When someone asks me about
the sky's missing blue color...

1159
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:31,245
I would tell them that
it is in your eyes...

1160
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:55,123
I'll curse myself if I fail to express
my feelings to you...

1161
01:13:55,664 --> 01:14:05,005
I'll praise myself if you say
what I want to say...

1162
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:09,634
I'll be myself if you are with me...

1163
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:13,905
else I will go mad...

1164
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,001
It's you people who should be blamed.

1165
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:42,376
You proved him in the name gang's honour.

1166
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:45,409
Now look what he says.
-Are we the reason for him to fall in love?

1167
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:48,447
His fatherfixed his engagement.

1168
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,311
Do you know the problems that may
arise if they come to know about this?

1169
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:51,144
So what?

1170
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:53,812
Do you know his problems?
We know him.

1171
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:55,051
We have been with him since childhood.

1172
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,051
He doesn't know what kind
of a girl he wants.

1173
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:58,087
But now he says he knows.

1174
01:14:58,293 --> 01:14:58,759
Why don't you listen to him?

1175
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:01,225
I'm warning you about the
problems he might have to face.

1176
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,364
What problems?
- Stop it.

1177
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:04,995
What are you talking?

1178
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:11,366
We are worried about your life.
- Bhanu, my...life will be very fine.

1179
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:13,370
I'm a good boy.

1180
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:17,372
If Hasini is with me,
I will be happy all my life.

1181
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:21,271
I love her.

1182
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,314
Does Hasini know this?

1183
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:26,846
I will tell hertomorrow.

1184
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:27,855
Tell me.

1185
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:30,448
I ask you something.
Will you answer me straight?

1186
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:33,025
I thought you called me here
to say something.

1187
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:35,119
But if it is about asking me...
Go ahead.

1188
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:40,793
What's there between us?
I'm talking to you.

1189
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:42,926
What's there between us?

1190
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,066
Nothing.

1191
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:45,672
I'm very serious.

1192
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,398
What's there between us?

1193
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:49,040
That's what I'm asking you.

1194
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:50,503
I will tell you later.

1195
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:52,778
When?
-After 5 years.

1196
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:53,974
Minimum 4 and half year.

1197
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:55,171
I don't have that much time.

1198
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:56,041
Tell me now.

1199
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:57,243
Okay. I will tell you.

1200
01:15:57,686 --> 01:16:00,416
Don't you have secrets?

1201
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:01,954
Don't you have anything personal?

1202
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,120
Just listen to me.
- No. I won't.

1203
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:06,321
Listen to me, I say.

1204
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:07,453
No Siddhu.

1205
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:08,219
Now you'll say something.

1206
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:09,795
And if I tell that to others,
you will shout at me.

1207
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:11,629
Please listen to me, Hasini.

1208
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:12,390
No. I won't.

1209
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:14,033
Listen I say.
- No I won't.

1210
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:15,794
If you don't, I will tell it to everyone.
- Go ahead.

1211
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,938
I will tell it for sure.
- Go ahead.

1212
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,101
Hello, you are very beautiful!
I love you.

1213
01:16:27,549 --> 01:16:28,573
He has told everyone. Idiot.

1214
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,279
Okay, come & tell me.

1215
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:47,833
Come.

1216
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:49,197
Who is she?

1217
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:50,232
Did you tell her?

1218
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:52,404
Did she agree?
- She's my fiance.

1219
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,577
I nevertried to hide it from you.

1220
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:03,882
If I really did, I would've never
told you even now.

1221
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:07,781
The engagement was against my wish.

1222
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:10,388
But still, the engagement stands.

1223
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,224
But that is my problem.

1224
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:13,490
I will handle it.

1225
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:18,129
You don't know how important
you are to my life.

1226
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:21,867
Only after meeting you,
I'm happy forthe first time in my life.

1227
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:24,170
And I want it all my life.

1228
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,503
If you really trust me, think over it.

1229
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:30,010
I will wait foryou.

1230
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:37,648
Have you bought the ticket?

1231
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:39,586
It's your stop to get down.

1232
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:46,892
There you are.
What should I make for dinner?

1233
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:52,923
She looks very upset.

1234
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:53,997
I will prepare something.

1235
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,435
I'm coming.

1236
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,061
Is it the telephone department?

1237
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:29,098
For Telugu, press 2.
- I will crush your neck.

1238
01:20:30,299 --> 01:20:31,232
I don't want to be like this.

1239
01:20:33,137 --> 01:20:38,976
I don't like to keep brooding
over it for hours.

1240
01:20:40,148 --> 01:20:43,119
You said that I do what I like.

1241
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:46,755
You are not interested in
that marriage, are you?

1242
01:20:48,828 --> 01:20:49,658
Then, don't marry.

1243
01:20:51,065 --> 01:20:52,590
Do what you like.

1244
01:20:55,405 --> 01:20:56,600
I trust you.

1245
01:20:57,876 --> 01:21:01,108
Bye.
- Stop Hasini.

1246
01:21:01,848 --> 01:21:02,610
What do you mean?

1247
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,616
I didn't get you.

1248
01:21:07,557 --> 01:21:08,251
Try to be clear.

1249
01:21:08,959 --> 01:21:10,290
How could you go away just like that?

1250
01:21:11,963 --> 01:21:12,692
What do you mean?

1251
01:22:38,765 --> 01:22:40,256
I don't want this shade.
Give me another one.

1252
01:22:40,467 --> 01:22:43,233
What is the new hair dye in the market?

1253
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:45,840
She will charge you too.
- No way.

1254
01:22:46,043 --> 01:22:46,908
What's happening here?

1255
01:22:47,245 --> 01:22:48,234
Is this house or a beauty parlour?

1256
01:22:49,148 --> 01:22:49,705
Clean it.

1257
01:22:57,661 --> 01:22:58,923
Tell him to come to office
from tomorrow.

1258
01:22:59,531 --> 01:23:00,020
What happened?

1259
01:23:00,398 --> 01:23:01,832
Tell him to come to office
from tomorrow.

1260
01:23:02,702 --> 01:23:03,192
What happened?

1261
01:23:03,403 --> 01:23:04,871
Ask him.

1262
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:05,999
Tell them what happened.

1263
01:23:06,474 --> 01:23:07,840
Tell them.

1264
01:23:08,912 --> 01:23:10,471
He is after a girl expressing his love.

1265
01:23:15,923 --> 01:23:16,912
What's wrong with you?

1266
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:18,054
Why are you like this?

1267
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:18,782
Who is she?

1268
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:21,555
What is your problem? Tell me.

1269
01:23:22,499 --> 01:23:24,798
Why are you like this? Say something.

1270
01:23:27,173 --> 01:23:28,162
I love that girl.

1271
01:23:34,118 --> 01:23:35,176
You love that girl!

1272
01:23:36,354 --> 01:23:37,754
Do you rememberyou're already engaged?

1273
01:23:39,225 --> 01:23:40,352
Your marriage is fixed with a girl,

1274
01:23:40,827 --> 01:23:42,693
and you've promised to marry hertoo.
Do you rememberthat?

1275
01:23:42,897 --> 01:23:43,694
We elders decided it.

1276
01:23:44,299 --> 01:23:46,200
Now, you say that...
Didn't you like that girl?

1277
01:23:47,371 --> 01:23:49,966
You could've told me then.
We did ask you, didn't we?

1278
01:23:50,175 --> 01:23:51,268
You could've told us that you didn't like her.

1279
01:23:51,477 --> 01:23:51,943
Tell me.

1280
01:23:52,146 --> 01:23:53,909
I didn't have reasons to
tell you on that day.

1281
01:23:54,215 --> 01:23:55,204
Do you have reasons now?

1282
01:23:55,985 --> 01:23:56,542
What is the reason?

1283
01:23:56,986 --> 01:23:57,885
You like this girl, right?

1284
01:23:58,488 --> 01:24:00,923
I have 100s of reasons to say
that I don't like her.

1285
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:01,917
Shall I tell you all that?

1286
01:24:02,161 --> 01:24:03,891
I've 100s of reasons to say that
I don't like her. Shall I tell you all that?

1287
01:24:04,197 --> 01:24:04,663
Tell me.

1288
01:24:04,865 --> 01:24:06,423
First try to know about her
and then tell your reasons.

1289
01:24:09,505 --> 01:24:09,971
Heard what he said?

1290
01:24:10,674 --> 01:24:12,039
He wants us to know about her.

1291
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:13,040
But how?

1292
01:24:13,578 --> 01:24:16,811
By going to restaurant & theatre
like you did? Tell us how.

1293
01:24:17,184 --> 01:24:18,948
Everyone please come here.

1294
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:20,186
We all will come.

1295
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:22,688
On which road should we all
stand to know about her?

1296
01:24:26,498 --> 01:24:28,991
I don't understand
what you are trying to say.

1297
01:24:29,603 --> 01:24:30,262
Try to be clear.

1298
01:24:30,772 --> 01:24:32,400
What will make us understand about her?

1299
01:24:33,442 --> 01:24:35,001
Father...
- Tell me.

1300
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:38,013
Actually.
- Try to be very clear.

1301
01:24:39,251 --> 01:24:39,946
If necessary...

1302
01:24:41,589 --> 01:24:43,455
I will bring herto our house for a week.

1303
01:24:49,701 --> 01:24:51,499
Do you know what you are talking about?

1304
01:24:52,205 --> 01:24:54,071
About my future.
Please keep quiet.

1305
01:25:10,132 --> 01:25:12,364
Meet her & then give me
one good reason.

1306
01:25:13,504 --> 01:25:14,096
I will forget about her.

1307
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:21,916
Father...

1308
01:25:24,188 --> 01:25:24,654
Bring her here.

1309
01:25:25,023 --> 01:25:26,889
Father...
-What else can I do now?

1310
01:25:28,027 --> 01:25:29,518
He'll feel bad if I tell him
the reason now.

1311
01:25:29,963 --> 01:25:31,431
Is it okay if I tell you the
reason after a week?

1312
01:25:32,501 --> 01:25:33,126
Just 1 week.

1313
01:25:34,537 --> 01:25:35,003
Bring her home.

1314
01:25:38,276 --> 01:25:41,304
Trying to convince him
in a week's time...!

1315
01:25:41,582 --> 01:25:44,883
You could've asked for our suggestions.

1316
01:25:45,387 --> 01:25:49,291
You took a decision where he decides.

1317
01:25:49,493 --> 01:25:52,055
I didn't know how to tell
him about Hasini.

1318
01:25:52,765 --> 01:25:54,825
But I had the courage
to tell him about her.

1319
01:25:55,536 --> 01:25:57,563
I convinced them to bring
her home for a week.

1320
01:25:58,007 --> 01:25:59,498
That's my first victory.

1321
01:25:59,776 --> 01:26:00,538
But still...

1322
01:26:00,878 --> 01:26:03,348
You know about yourfather & Hasini.

1323
01:26:03,582 --> 01:26:04,549
How is this possible?

1324
01:26:05,685 --> 01:26:06,174
It must be possible.

1325
01:26:06,988 --> 01:26:11,393
Won't I get one incident to convince him
that she is the right girl for me?

1326
01:26:11,728 --> 01:26:13,925
But how can Hasini come to your house?

1327
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:15,958
She will come.

1328
01:26:16,435 --> 01:26:16,901
I won't come.

1329
01:26:17,169 --> 01:26:20,868
I'm not asking you to come to theatre,
park orto elope & marry.

1330
01:26:21,143 --> 01:26:21,734
To my house.

1331
01:26:22,444 --> 01:26:26,314
7 days...how can I?
- It's our problem to prove our love, isn't it?

1332
01:26:26,517 --> 01:26:26,984
He is right.

1333
01:26:29,155 --> 01:26:30,053
But still, I won't come.

1334
01:26:45,914 --> 01:26:50,148
Hasini, we have only 2 choices.

1335
01:26:51,056 --> 01:26:52,456
1. I have to take you to my house.

1336
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:55,117
2. I have to leave my house.

1337
01:26:56,564 --> 01:26:58,999
If I leave my house,
I will lose a good family.

1338
01:27:00,036 --> 01:27:03,235
If I take you there, I will be happy
to have given you a good family.

1339
01:27:03,842 --> 01:27:06,471
What should I do now...?
- Talking about yourfamily all the time.

1340
01:27:07,147 --> 01:27:09,343
Don't I have a family?
-Yes, a big family!

1341
01:27:09,551 --> 01:27:11,577
There are only 2 people.
He likes drinking & she likes chatting.

1342
01:27:13,056 --> 01:27:14,820
Hasini, I want you.

1343
01:27:15,661 --> 01:27:17,094
If you want me, trust me & come.

1344
01:27:17,564 --> 01:27:20,056
Okay. But my father must agree to this.

1345
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:22,332
Will you come if he agrees?

1346
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:23,402
But how?

1347
01:27:23,806 --> 01:27:24,568
There is a man forthat.

1348
01:27:25,409 --> 01:27:27,503
Kismat Kumar, M.A., Ph.d.,
making a humble request.

1349
01:27:27,712 --> 01:27:28,577
Still I won't agree.

1350
01:27:28,781 --> 01:27:32,344
You must agree. I've given my word.
- To whom?

1351
01:27:33,454 --> 01:27:34,854
To the college staff.

1352
01:27:35,557 --> 01:27:37,993
I've given them my word to
bring your daughterto the tour.

1353
01:27:38,362 --> 01:27:39,990
I will lose my honour if I don't.

1354
01:27:40,232 --> 01:27:42,224
I will lose my honour if I send her.
- How?

1355
01:27:42,568 --> 01:27:45,835
I think there is a boy
who is after my daughter.

1356
01:27:46,642 --> 01:27:50,671
I receive single calls,
double calls & missed calls.

1357
01:27:51,616 --> 01:27:52,914
Someone in the college must be...

1358
01:27:53,652 --> 01:27:54,915
No. No boy in the college
has that many guts.

1359
01:27:55,121 --> 01:27:56,783
I'm sure he is not from the college.

1360
01:27:57,759 --> 01:27:59,021
How do you know that?

1361
01:28:00,563 --> 01:28:01,826
You suspect a lot.

1362
01:28:02,232 --> 01:28:03,700
I love my daughter.

1363
01:28:03,902 --> 01:28:05,063
It might bring trouble too.

1364
01:28:05,271 --> 01:28:09,607
Why do have doubt when a college
lecturer himself is making a request?

1365
01:28:09,844 --> 01:28:12,110
That's why I doubt more.

1366
01:28:12,649 --> 01:28:16,849
She is my daughter & I'm herfather.
- It's true.

1367
01:28:17,055 --> 01:28:19,321
She could've asked me, couldn't she?

1368
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:21,288
Why are you seeking permission for her?

1369
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:23,492
Because I'm an idiot.
- Could be.

1370
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:25,531
Your daughter won't ask your permission.

1371
01:28:25,936 --> 01:28:26,801
He won't leave me.

1372
01:28:27,004 --> 01:28:28,939
And I'm caught in between.
-Who is he?

1373
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:31,572
Did I say so?
- I heard.

1374
01:28:31,778 --> 01:28:35,147
If I could convince you to give permission
foryour daughterto join this tour,

1375
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:39,717
they gave me this objective
to earn eternal fame in college.

1376
01:28:40,058 --> 01:28:41,651
Forgive me if I was wrong. Bye.

1377
01:28:42,061 --> 01:28:42,652
Stop.

1378
01:28:43,597 --> 01:28:45,589
Do you have a phone?
- It has a numbertoo.

1379
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,425
Write your phone number.
-Why?

1380
01:28:47,636 --> 01:28:50,732
How can I live without talking
to my daughterfor a week?

1381
01:28:50,941 --> 01:28:52,466
So, you are permitting herto join tour.

1382
01:28:52,677 --> 01:28:55,476
Though she decided to go,

1383
01:28:55,816 --> 01:29:00,084
she respected me by seeking
my permission.-Yes.

1384
01:29:00,322 --> 01:29:02,086
As a father, I should keep up my respect.

1385
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:02,758
What do you say?

1386
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:03,927
So, you are sending herto the tour.

1387
01:29:04,997 --> 01:29:06,556
Forget about thanking me.

1388
01:29:06,966 --> 01:29:08,525
I will get a good name among
the students, right?

1389
01:29:08,736 --> 01:29:09,964
If you get caught, your name will
be published in the paper.

1390
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:10,829
Paper?

1391
01:29:11,139 --> 01:29:12,664
I mean the media will get
a news to publish.

1392
01:29:13,342 --> 01:29:15,904
It sounded differently to me.
Take care of her.

1393
01:29:16,114 --> 01:29:16,842
Take care of yourself too.

1394
01:29:17,348 --> 01:29:18,077
Why?

1395
01:29:18,284 --> 01:29:20,480
Who lied to bring her out?
- Me.

1396
01:29:20,954 --> 01:29:22,820
Who will he ask if something goes wrong?
- Me.

1397
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:25,088
So, who has the problems?
- Me.

1398
01:29:27,097 --> 01:29:28,223
Where are you taking herto?

1399
01:29:38,949 --> 01:29:40,440
Father, she is...
- I know...

1400
01:29:43,022 --> 01:29:45,423
She is Harini.
- Hasini, uncle.

1401
01:29:50,901 --> 01:29:52,028
There are certain rules in this house.

1402
01:29:52,604 --> 01:29:53,229
I know.

1403
01:29:55,742 --> 01:29:56,367
He didn't tell me.

1404
01:29:56,576 --> 01:29:58,010
I could sense that by looking you all.

1405
01:29:59,113 --> 01:30:00,809
But they don't apply to you.

1406
01:30:01,918 --> 01:30:04,183
You are our guest.

1407
01:30:04,789 --> 01:30:05,949
So, be yourself..

1408
01:30:07,526 --> 01:30:08,185
...for a week.

1409
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:12,895
Father...
- Introduce herto others.

1410
01:30:21,482 --> 01:30:23,451
She is my mom.
- Greetings aunty.

1411
01:30:24,987 --> 01:30:26,580
Your song was superb.

1412
01:30:27,391 --> 01:30:29,019
I heard it from Siddhu's phone.

1413
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:39,776
She is my sister-in-law.

1414
01:30:49,258 --> 01:30:50,157
Hasini, she is Bujji.

1415
01:30:58,405 --> 01:30:59,737
He did what he said.

1416
01:30:59,974 --> 01:31:00,998
He brought her home.

1417
01:31:01,310 --> 01:31:02,800
He might introduce herto me.

1418
01:31:03,046 --> 01:31:04,947
Keep talking & I will go away.

1419
01:31:05,350 --> 01:31:05,907
Greetings.

1420
01:31:08,955 --> 01:31:09,421
Sister...

1421
01:31:16,934 --> 01:31:18,232
Who is she?

1422
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:19,904
Why did you bring her here?

1423
01:31:20,106 --> 01:31:22,302
There is no one to tell you stories, right?

1424
01:31:22,676 --> 01:31:23,735
So, he brought me here.

1425
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:25,078
Do you know stories?

1426
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,509
I know so many.
Shall I tell you one?

1427
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:29,416
She will tell you later. Come.

1428
01:31:34,461 --> 01:31:34,927
Come in.

1429
01:31:39,503 --> 01:31:40,936
I like your room.

1430
01:31:41,572 --> 01:31:42,698
Today, even I like my room.

1431
01:31:44,376 --> 01:31:46,208
My lover in my room!

1432
01:31:47,948 --> 01:31:50,145
I can't believe it.
- Believe it.

1433
01:32:00,568 --> 01:32:01,467
What did you say?

1434
01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:02,829
He said he loves me.

1435
01:32:03,673 --> 01:32:04,230
Can't you shut up?

1436
01:32:04,441 --> 01:32:06,536
Why did you shout?
- That was when I pinched him.

1437
01:32:07,012 --> 01:32:07,501
Pinched him?

1438
01:32:08,714 --> 01:32:09,681
I haven't introduced herto you.

1439
01:32:10,016 --> 01:32:11,450
She is Hasini, a very good girl.

1440
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:13,816
Sathi, a good servant.

1441
01:32:14,356 --> 01:32:17,759
Ask me anything you want
I will get it foryou.

1442
01:32:17,962 --> 01:32:19,328
I want water immediately.

1443
01:32:19,965 --> 01:32:22,491
She is superb.

1444
01:32:22,735 --> 01:32:23,202
Thank you.

1445
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:25,972
I forgot to tell you something.
They asked you both to come for lunch.

1446
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:28,673
I will get it foryou.

1447
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:31,544
Sathi, keep the water on the table.

1448
01:32:32,084 --> 01:32:33,176
Please talk to me, mom.

1449
01:32:34,621 --> 01:32:36,214
Sathi, did you tell everyone?

1450
01:32:55,954 --> 01:32:56,420
Sit.

1451
01:33:09,108 --> 01:33:11,737
Weren't you taught to use
a cloth while eating?

1452
01:33:12,146 --> 01:33:13,978
I was taught to eat without spilling.

1453
01:33:29,272 --> 01:33:31,070
She offers prayers before eating.

1454
01:33:31,642 --> 01:33:32,109
No.

1455
01:33:33,746 --> 01:33:35,179
There are too many dishes here.

1456
01:33:35,516 --> 01:33:36,744
I may eat more.

1457
01:33:36,984 --> 01:33:41,720
So, I control myself not to eat more.

1458
01:33:51,874 --> 01:33:55,208
Why are you so quiet?
Won't you talk while eating?

1459
01:33:59,586 --> 01:34:01,885
Since you are new to this house,
they're feeling shy.

1460
01:34:04,093 --> 01:34:07,223
Does yourfather know
that you're coming here?

1461
01:34:07,632 --> 01:34:08,292
Yes, he knows.
- No, he doesn't know.

1462
01:34:10,803 --> 01:34:11,667
He doesn't know Siddhu.

1463
01:34:13,073 --> 01:34:14,541
Will he send me if I tell him?

1464
01:34:14,909 --> 01:34:17,003
Forget about my father, will you send?

1465
01:34:20,986 --> 01:34:21,975
Shall I serve gravy?
- Serve.

1466
01:34:22,588 --> 01:34:24,454
Even I shouldn't have agreed
to come here.

1467
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:28,023
But I didn't want hurt Siddhu.
So, I came.

1468
01:34:30,734 --> 01:34:33,705
My father works in Hindu Charitable and
Endowments Dept..

1469
01:34:33,973 --> 01:34:35,999
We can visit all temples free of cost.

1470
01:34:36,243 --> 01:34:37,768
And God offerings?
- Free, Sathi.

1471
01:34:45,457 --> 01:34:47,255
Can I tell you something?

1472
01:34:49,229 --> 01:34:50,993
You are very handsome.

1473
01:34:58,577 --> 01:34:59,704
Do you always talk like this?

1474
01:35:00,613 --> 01:35:01,171
No uncle.

1475
01:35:01,916 --> 01:35:04,546
I'm new to this place.
So, I'm speaking very little.

1476
01:35:04,854 --> 01:35:05,343
Am I right, Siddhu?

1477
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:23,370
Does he love this girl?

1478
01:35:25,385 --> 01:35:26,580
Say something, Lakshmi.

1479
01:35:27,088 --> 01:35:30,116
What can I say when he said
it is about his future?

1480
01:35:30,761 --> 01:35:31,284
No Lakshmi.

1481
01:35:32,396 --> 01:35:33,454
If our children go wrong,
we must advice them.

1482
01:35:33,866 --> 01:35:34,833
We must show them the right path.

1483
01:35:35,334 --> 01:35:37,064
He might not listen to you.

1484
01:35:37,838 --> 01:35:39,534
But we must make him understand.

1485
01:35:40,642 --> 01:35:42,110
That's why I asked him to bring that girl.

1486
01:35:43,781 --> 01:35:48,015
Won't I get a chance to tell him
that she is not the right girl?

1487
01:35:49,923 --> 01:35:50,481
Where are you going?

1488
01:35:50,925 --> 01:35:51,584
Room shifting.

1489
01:35:51,793 --> 01:35:52,351
Going to your room.

1490
01:35:52,728 --> 01:35:54,128
Who is coming to my room?

1491
01:35:54,531 --> 01:35:56,261
Shall I tell you what I know
or shall I find out from him?

1492
01:35:56,467 --> 01:35:57,126
Tell me what you know.

1493
01:35:57,569 --> 01:36:00,232
Yourfather is shifting into your room.
- Father is coming to my room?

1494
01:36:00,473 --> 01:36:01,463
Even I was shell shocked.

1495
01:36:01,809 --> 01:36:04,278
But later I found that it is your
brother & not yourfather.

1496
01:36:04,547 --> 01:36:05,514
What time you're fixing the alarm?

1497
01:36:06,081 --> 01:36:06,571
6 AM.

1498
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:08,209
You won't get up till 7 AM, will you?

1499
01:36:08,853 --> 01:36:09,820
But you will get up at 6 Am.

1500
01:36:10,122 --> 01:36:11,384
I'm not used to it.

1501
01:36:12,759 --> 01:36:13,727
It was sister-in-law who
gave this time-piece.

1502
01:36:16,131 --> 01:36:16,597
Good night.

1503
01:36:21,539 --> 01:36:23,770
I was trying to see through
this in the dark.

1504
01:36:23,976 --> 01:36:24,705
Did you get scared?

1505
01:36:26,414 --> 01:36:26,880
Come.

1506
01:36:27,081 --> 01:36:29,141
I don't need the full bed.
A small corner is enough.

1507
01:36:30,453 --> 01:36:31,385
Are you going out to sleep?

1508
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:33,955
Here.

1509
01:36:35,561 --> 01:36:36,357
What are these for?

1510
01:36:38,465 --> 01:36:39,091
Won't you speak to me?

1511
01:36:48,748 --> 01:36:49,578
Please...

1512
01:37:24,002 --> 01:37:24,662
What are you doing here?

1513
01:37:24,904 --> 01:37:26,634
I couldn't sleep properly.

1514
01:37:27,041 --> 01:37:28,270
And you?
- Me too.

1515
01:37:28,977 --> 01:37:29,443
Why?

1516
01:37:30,146 --> 01:37:32,479
Because we have only 6 days left.

1517
01:37:33,584 --> 01:37:34,744
6 more people to be trapped.

1518
01:37:35,654 --> 01:37:37,885
I was wondering how to bait these fishes.

1519
01:37:38,091 --> 01:37:38,557
Bait?

1520
01:37:39,327 --> 01:37:40,989
Only then we can catch fishes.

1521
01:37:42,364 --> 01:37:43,127
Yes.

1522
01:37:45,169 --> 01:37:46,193
Why are you coming closer?

1523
01:37:47,205 --> 01:37:48,639
I'm very tensed.

1524
01:37:49,075 --> 01:37:49,541
So what?

1525
01:37:51,111 --> 01:37:53,673
I'm very tensed.
- Don't make me tensed.

1526
01:37:57,455 --> 01:38:00,152
Will yourtension go if I come closer?

1527
01:38:01,995 --> 01:38:03,554
A kiss would clear all my tension.

1528
01:38:38,885 --> 01:38:42,323
I painted a picture and it was you...

1529
01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:46,824
It came near and asked me to kiss her...

1530
01:38:47,298 --> 01:38:50,895
When I went near pitying her...

1531
01:38:51,171 --> 01:38:54,700
She said her heart is with you...

1532
01:38:55,343 --> 01:38:59,112
And asked me to kiss you...

1533
01:39:00,085 --> 01:39:03,545
I'm in the age to love
and romance...

1534
01:39:04,391 --> 01:39:08,022
What's wrong if I take interest in it?

1535
01:39:08,565 --> 01:39:12,196
I too love to kiss you...

1536
01:39:12,437 --> 01:39:16,034
But shyness is stopping me...

1537
01:39:16,643 --> 01:39:20,547
It says there's time for it...

1538
01:39:38,344 --> 01:39:42,180
Chill breeze is making
my loverto shiver in cold...

1539
01:39:42,618 --> 01:39:46,420
It told me to entwine you
like a warm hug...

1540
01:39:46,957 --> 01:39:50,918
I know how to keep myself warm
from the cold...

1541
01:39:51,164 --> 01:39:54,932
Stop imagining,
I don't need your help...

1542
01:39:55,404 --> 01:40:03,543
Why are you asking me to leave
when I wish to be with you?

1543
01:40:04,150 --> 01:40:10,787
How benevolent you are on me?

1544
01:40:11,061 --> 01:40:15,467
What can I do?
There's something special in you...

1545
01:40:16,203 --> 01:40:19,971
It pulled me towards you...

1546
01:40:48,586 --> 01:40:52,456
She's beautiful,
the world is after her...

1547
01:40:52,892 --> 01:40:56,625
Keep the world out from following her
is what my heart yearns...

1548
01:40:57,166 --> 01:41:01,036
There's a thing as my companion
which you don't know...

1549
01:41:01,239 --> 01:41:05,541
It's none otherthan
my own shadow...

1550
01:41:05,746 --> 01:41:13,886
Breeze will also get tired
walking with you, my dear...

1551
01:41:14,092 --> 01:41:21,002
No need to get so dejected,
you are my shadow!

1552
01:41:21,337 --> 01:41:25,742
I was waiting to hear
this from you...

1553
01:41:26,211 --> 01:41:29,910
I was dreaming forthis day...

1554
01:42:02,735 --> 01:42:04,431
Coffee.

1555
01:42:04,671 --> 01:42:06,367
Sathi, do you know to read paper?

1556
01:42:06,574 --> 01:42:08,042
No. I hate reading paper.

1557
01:42:08,243 --> 01:42:10,872
Why?
- Because I'm an illiterate.

1558
01:42:11,414 --> 01:42:13,212
Why are your eyes so red?

1559
01:42:13,450 --> 01:42:15,317
I couldn't sleep properly.

1560
01:42:16,322 --> 01:42:18,154
It takes time to get used to this place.

1561
01:42:22,999 --> 01:42:23,966
Yourfather has got up.

1562
01:42:25,636 --> 01:42:27,104
And he has gone for jogging too.

1563
01:42:27,305 --> 01:42:29,103
But he didn't inquire about you.

1564
01:42:30,577 --> 01:42:31,509
Why are your eyes so red?

1565
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:32,912
I couldn't sleep properly.

1566
01:42:34,116 --> 01:42:36,176
Both of them couldn't sleep properly.

1567
01:42:36,386 --> 01:42:38,150
Something fishy...

1568
01:42:38,356 --> 01:42:40,986
Don't try to know what happened.
You won't get sleep.

1569
01:42:50,708 --> 01:42:51,504
Do you want the paper?

1570
01:42:53,012 --> 01:42:53,479
Give it.

1571
01:42:53,747 --> 01:42:55,739
I will give it afterfinishing
the sports column.

1572
01:43:12,742 --> 01:43:13,573
What are you doing?

1573
01:43:15,012 --> 01:43:16,981
How many times will you tell this?
- Until you say it.

1574
01:43:24,394 --> 01:43:25,452
You said you'll tell me stories.

1575
01:43:39,718 --> 01:43:41,914
Sathi...
- Coming.

1576
01:43:44,359 --> 01:43:44,950
Where is the tablet?

1577
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:46,054
Oh my God!

1578
01:43:47,863 --> 01:43:48,592
What is it Siddhu?

1579
01:43:49,299 --> 01:43:49,994
This is my father's BP tablet.

1580
01:43:50,301 --> 01:43:50,960
You are giving it to him today.

1581
01:43:51,168 --> 01:43:51,635
Why?

1582
01:43:52,037 --> 01:43:54,632
Angler...to trap the big fish.

1583
01:43:55,943 --> 01:43:57,741
Sathi, get me my tablet.

1584
01:44:05,057 --> 01:44:05,682
Where were you?

1585
01:44:06,826 --> 01:44:08,124
Don't you know to stand next
to me while I go to office?

1586
01:44:10,265 --> 01:44:11,289
Do what you've do,
that's enough.

1587
01:44:24,621 --> 01:44:28,559
Is this what you call high BP?
First time I'm experiencing it.

1588
01:44:29,328 --> 01:44:32,925
Angling for big fish didn't work out?
How to catch it?

1589
01:44:33,868 --> 01:44:35,199
It's not a fish, it's a shark.

1590
01:44:36,272 --> 01:44:37,968
How about for otherfishes...
- No need for angler,

1591
01:44:39,911 --> 01:44:41,470
Let's lay a net.
- Net?

1592
01:44:42,582 --> 01:44:43,640
Mother is calling you.

1593
01:44:59,575 --> 01:45:00,064
Did you call me?

1594
01:45:22,009 --> 01:45:24,240
Did you see me head butting?

1595
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:28,886
Why did you do it?

1596
01:45:29,087 --> 01:45:31,318
Did you see the head butt outside
orthe one inside?

1597
01:45:32,092 --> 01:45:33,184
Did you butt outside too?

1598
01:45:33,461 --> 01:45:35,623
He did it outside, I butted him inside.

1599
01:45:36,131 --> 01:45:38,191
You'll get horns if you get
butt once, you know that?

1600
01:45:38,568 --> 01:45:42,632
Horns?
I did it now, will she get horns?

1601
01:45:43,476 --> 01:45:46,606
Her husband is poor man!
He can't see her with horns.

1602
01:45:49,485 --> 01:45:50,214
Isn't it good?

1603
01:45:51,121 --> 01:45:52,350
Does Siddhu believe all this?

1604
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:57,059
Believes? He liked this and
chased to ask me for a coffee.

1605
01:45:57,531 --> 01:45:58,829
Is it?
-Yes.

1606
01:45:59,167 --> 01:46:02,605
I took him to Minerva cafe
traveling in a double decker bus,

1607
01:46:02,806 --> 01:46:05,799
and had a coffee with him.
- Not about you, tell us about him.

1608
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:19,891
You know, he bunked a function
to have 'Paanipoori' with me?

1609
01:46:23,772 --> 01:46:26,140
What's going on inside?

1610
01:46:26,777 --> 01:46:28,405
You want me to tell what I know ortell
after knowing going on inside?

1611
01:46:28,613 --> 01:46:29,602
Tell what you know.

1612
01:46:29,882 --> 01:46:30,576
Then I don't know anything.

1613
01:46:31,851 --> 01:46:34,685
Tell me after knowing. Go

1614
01:46:38,394 --> 01:46:42,025
Good boy? Don't say it with Siddhu,
he'll get angry.

1615
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:43,800
He abuses using choicest
epithets when he's angry.

1616
01:46:44,003 --> 01:46:45,266
Siddhu uses bad words?

1617
01:46:46,174 --> 01:46:47,402
Yes, that brings to my memory,

1618
01:46:47,775 --> 01:46:49,802
once in my college...
- In college?

1619
01:46:50,380 --> 01:46:50,937
What?

1620
01:46:51,982 --> 01:46:54,144
Friends!
- Okay friends!

1621
01:46:55,288 --> 01:46:58,851
Excuse me! Do you put hands
and legs now also?

1622
01:46:59,594 --> 01:47:00,755
What's that?

1623
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:04,133
Okay, tell me.

1624
01:47:06,839 --> 01:47:09,274
When few rogues were
teasing me that day,

1625
01:47:09,642 --> 01:47:12,841
he beat them black and blue.

1626
01:47:15,117 --> 01:47:16,710
Oh God! Got hurt Sathi?

1627
01:47:18,356 --> 01:47:19,949
No problem, he'll not mind it.
You carry on.

1628
01:47:22,964 --> 01:47:28,030
Ever since then those rogues
are calling me as Sister.

1629
01:47:30,375 --> 01:47:30,898
What?

1630
01:47:33,079 --> 01:47:33,603
Why are you tensed?

1631
01:47:33,881 --> 01:47:36,544
Unable to tell what I saw.
- No need to tell, keep it in your heart.

1632
01:47:36,885 --> 01:47:38,319
Do you know what's happening inside?

1633
01:47:38,554 --> 01:47:40,284
I know everything because I planned it.

1634
01:47:41,359 --> 01:47:42,348
Is this your plan?

1635
01:47:43,395 --> 01:47:45,364
I thought you were class but
you're downright mass.

1636
01:47:45,865 --> 01:47:48,995
Angler, net, fishing,
they are all mass effects.

1637
01:47:49,371 --> 01:47:50,168
But they do workout well.

1638
01:47:50,706 --> 01:47:52,368
Is she talking about me?

1639
01:47:52,576 --> 01:47:55,775
Not just talking,
she's running a soap opera.

1640
01:47:56,315 --> 01:48:01,449
I know she's very talented.
- Then present her an award.

1641
01:48:01,823 --> 01:48:02,882
Call Hasini out.

1642
01:48:03,693 --> 01:48:05,525
I don't think she'll come out from
the soap opera midway.

1643
01:48:05,729 --> 01:48:06,958
I know how to call her.

1644
01:48:20,419 --> 01:48:21,785
He brought her here to let
his family know about her.

1645
01:48:21,988 --> 01:48:23,286
But they are knowing things
about him instead.

1646
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:24,458
I don't know what's in store.

1647
01:48:33,807 --> 01:48:35,537
Wait, it will stop.

1648
01:48:40,450 --> 01:48:41,247
Wait.

1649
01:48:41,518 --> 01:48:42,348
Wait...wait...it will stop again.

1650
01:48:44,022 --> 01:48:46,322
Don't you know this is
universal lovers' code?

1651
01:48:49,030 --> 01:48:51,523
If I don't lift it now,
it will go on ring.

1652
01:48:55,807 --> 01:48:58,972
Is Hasini there?
I'm calling from ICICI Bank.

1653
01:49:02,451 --> 01:49:02,940
Siddhu!

1654
01:49:03,152 --> 01:49:03,641
Siddhu, it's me!

1655
01:49:04,053 --> 01:49:06,353
Thank God! I thought phone call mad
or make-up mad girl is answering it.

1656
01:49:10,563 --> 01:49:11,792
What did you talk to them?

1657
01:49:12,066 --> 01:49:13,226
I talked about general things.

1658
01:49:13,969 --> 01:49:14,867
I'll tell you later.

1659
01:49:15,070 --> 01:49:16,197
Not later, tell me right now.

1660
01:49:16,572 --> 01:49:18,473
Uncle?
-Yes, don't make noise.

1661
01:49:18,743 --> 01:49:19,732
Can't I avoid it?

1662
01:49:21,447 --> 01:49:22,106
You can't.

1663
01:49:22,916 --> 01:49:25,943
That is...our regular ice cream jaunt...

1664
01:49:26,221 --> 01:49:28,520
Yes, it's been long since
ljumped the wall.

1665
01:49:29,025 --> 01:49:30,789
It's difficult now, but let's make a try.

1666
01:49:31,395 --> 01:49:33,331
How did you catch those fishes?

1667
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:37,629
They say you are a good boy.

1668
01:49:38,039 --> 01:49:39,598
That's how I maintain my image at home.

1669
01:49:42,112 --> 01:49:44,912
How can those frogs in the well
know about the outside world?

1670
01:49:45,884 --> 01:49:49,413
Their world is phone, make up,
kitchen, father. That's all!

1671
01:49:49,658 --> 01:49:50,784
They think that's the life.

1672
01:49:51,594 --> 01:49:52,822
Poor souls, Siddhu.

1673
01:49:53,096 --> 01:49:54,724
I too feel pity on them.

1674
01:49:54,965 --> 01:49:55,455
Poor souls.

1675
01:49:58,637 --> 01:50:01,005
Whatever it is,
our plan has succeeded.

1676
01:50:01,943 --> 01:50:03,343
May I ask you a thing
in this happy mood?

1677
01:50:06,317 --> 01:50:08,718
What is it?
- It's long time since...

1678
01:50:09,387 --> 01:50:10,355
Just only once...

1679
01:50:14,896 --> 01:50:17,196
Siddhu...
-Just once..

1680
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:21,331
Call me idiot!

1681
01:50:24,445 --> 01:50:25,002
Please...

1682
01:50:26,081 --> 01:50:27,275
Siddhu, you're a real idiot.

1683
01:50:37,798 --> 01:50:41,258
Sir...sir...
-Why are you tensed?

1684
01:50:41,538 --> 01:50:43,097
It's time forfather's arrival.

1685
01:50:43,908 --> 01:50:45,206
Why are you so happy?

1686
01:50:45,477 --> 01:50:50,110
It's time fatherto come,
he must know what transpired in kitchen.

1687
01:50:50,318 --> 01:50:52,219
Everything?
-Yes, everything.

1688
01:50:52,655 --> 01:50:56,115
I thought you're real mass,
but you're a front bench favourite.

1689
01:50:58,397 --> 01:50:59,228
Hasini, hold this.

1690
01:51:00,333 --> 01:51:02,462
Where had you been?
- To Seenu's home.

1691
01:51:02,938 --> 01:51:04,804
Sister, look how casually
he's lying to us.

1692
01:51:05,708 --> 01:51:07,643
No, not like that.
May I teach you?

1693
01:51:07,845 --> 01:51:10,474
No need, she needn't jump
over walls after grown up.

1694
01:51:11,451 --> 01:51:12,475
Jump over walls?

1695
01:51:12,686 --> 01:51:13,483
Would you like to have juice sir?

1696
01:51:13,688 --> 01:51:17,717
Serve him ice cream, he has come
from hot sun, that will cool him.

1697
01:51:18,361 --> 01:51:19,158
Ice cream?

1698
01:51:19,363 --> 01:51:21,491
Won't you've ice cream
unless it's midnight?

1699
01:51:25,872 --> 01:51:27,842
Chintu, come.
- Go away.

1700
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:28,676
What?

1701
01:51:28,877 --> 01:51:31,176
I'll also become an idiot
if I go with you.

1702
01:51:32,650 --> 01:51:33,276
Idiot!?

1703
01:51:36,656 --> 01:51:38,181
Everyone is talking and behaving strangely.

1704
01:51:38,392 --> 01:51:40,521
Cool off, how can you be not
aware of your own plan?

1705
01:51:40,730 --> 01:51:41,697
My plan?

1706
01:51:42,064 --> 01:51:44,193
This is the soap opera she was
running in the kitchen.

1707
01:51:44,402 --> 01:51:45,027
This one?

1708
01:51:48,174 --> 01:51:49,642
Why are you tensed?

1709
01:51:50,344 --> 01:51:51,642
Father will be coming at any time.

1710
01:51:57,589 --> 01:51:58,214
Hi father.

1711
01:51:59,091 --> 01:51:59,887
Why are you tensed?

1712
01:52:00,092 --> 01:52:02,654
Nothing father.
- I know it, I'll tell you.

1713
01:52:02,864 --> 01:52:03,558
Actually what had happened was...

1714
01:52:03,765 --> 01:52:05,734
Okay cool, stop your mischief.

1715
01:52:15,550 --> 01:52:16,574
What happened Siddhu?

1716
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:20,750
It all happened because of you.

1717
01:52:21,225 --> 01:52:23,626
When I said about laying net,
you said yes.

1718
01:52:23,829 --> 01:52:26,425
I said yes for net but
will you make me the bait?

1719
01:52:26,734 --> 01:52:28,259
I don't know whetheryou're doing
this wantonly or unwittingly.

1720
01:52:29,137 --> 01:52:32,267
I said very little but you
told a lot in the phone.

1721
01:52:32,476 --> 01:52:33,101
Phone?

1722
01:52:34,846 --> 01:52:36,610
Your sister switched on the speaker.

1723
01:52:41,757 --> 01:52:43,453
Thank God, father doesn't know this.

1724
01:52:43,827 --> 01:52:44,795
What if he knows it?

1725
01:52:46,665 --> 01:52:48,133
I'll take care of everything.

1726
01:52:48,568 --> 01:52:50,628
If you talk to anyone in the family...

1727
01:52:51,506 --> 01:52:53,236
...will you talk to them?
- No.

1728
01:52:59,218 --> 01:53:02,417
Asking me not to talk or
stop putting a pillow next to you,

1729
01:53:02,757 --> 01:53:04,157
nobody can do it to us.

1730
01:53:08,866 --> 01:53:11,996
It smells like apple.
- Cream is apple flavour.

1731
01:53:12,605 --> 01:53:14,665
Don't you've orange flavour?
- Don't talk.

1732
01:53:15,042 --> 01:53:16,339
I'll get bored.

1733
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:20,847
You've to mix, apply, wipe after
it's dry, you've lot to do.

1734
01:53:21,051 --> 01:53:22,781
You've made me sit idle.

1735
01:53:23,054 --> 01:53:26,184
Are you idle?
You've been chattering.

1736
01:53:26,894 --> 01:53:31,698
Bujji, take me to the sofa.
I'll watch TV.

1737
01:53:33,738 --> 01:53:36,708
You're happy-go-lucky character.
- I'm always like that.

1738
01:53:36,943 --> 01:53:39,708
Why don't you start a beauty parlour?

1739
01:53:39,914 --> 01:53:42,145
I asked father,
he told me open it here.

1740
01:53:42,351 --> 01:53:44,820
I'm bored working on the same faces.

1741
01:53:45,022 --> 01:53:47,048
Open it outside.
- I need money for it.

1742
01:53:47,325 --> 01:53:49,226
Try for a loan like Siddhu.

1743
01:53:50,263 --> 01:53:51,891
Is Siddhu trying to get a loan?

1744
01:53:52,099 --> 01:53:53,727
Don't you know this?
- No.

1745
01:53:53,936 --> 01:53:56,064
True, to start a business of his own.

1746
01:53:56,272 --> 01:53:59,243
He has applied to a bank for
a loan of Rs. 2.5 millions.

1747
01:53:59,444 --> 01:54:00,240
Really?

1748
01:54:02,114 --> 01:54:02,740
Father!

1749
01:54:03,116 --> 01:54:04,243
Father?

1750
01:54:06,288 --> 01:54:08,849
Why are you all so scared of father?

1751
01:54:09,059 --> 01:54:11,085
We'll not tell uncle about this.

1752
01:54:11,363 --> 01:54:14,765
I'll ask Siddhu to give you Rs. 2 lakhs
when he gets the loan.

1753
01:54:15,035 --> 01:54:16,936
I'll stand surety foryou.

1754
01:55:05,881 --> 01:55:06,677
What is this?

1755
01:55:07,884 --> 01:55:11,344
Uncle...that's...a new girl there...

1756
01:55:15,729 --> 01:55:16,856
I was asking about this.

1757
01:55:17,398 --> 01:55:18,296
File uncle?

1758
01:55:18,499 --> 01:55:19,967
How can this work out?

1759
01:55:21,972 --> 01:55:23,873
No father...
-Ain't I talking to them?

1760
01:55:25,912 --> 01:55:27,038
Not just Rs. 2.5 million,

1761
01:55:28,082 --> 01:55:29,344
tell him to ask what I can't
earn in my lifetime,

1762
01:55:29,517 --> 01:55:32,180
I'll earn and give him.
Will I earn or not?-You will uncle.

1763
01:55:33,423 --> 01:55:35,221
He has committed a mistake by
doing this without my knowledge.

1764
01:55:36,427 --> 01:55:38,225
If I keep quiet after knowing this,
it will be a blunder.

1765
01:55:38,765 --> 01:55:39,891
It shouldn't happen, what do you say?

1766
01:55:40,601 --> 01:55:41,568
Whateveryou say is right.

1767
01:55:47,946 --> 01:55:48,571
When is your marriage?

1768
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:49,748
Wheneveryou decide, uncle.

1769
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:53,147
That is...my marriage is
on day aftertomorrow.

1770
01:55:53,388 --> 01:55:54,252
Tell him that.

1771
01:55:54,522 --> 01:55:55,751
I'm getting married day aftertomorrow.

1772
01:55:56,191 --> 01:55:56,920
We'll tell him uncle.

1773
01:55:57,794 --> 01:56:02,757
You're his friends,
put some sense into him.

1774
01:56:06,141 --> 01:56:08,838
Thank God! Bye, spare us alive.

1775
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:11,276
We are finished.

1776
01:56:17,191 --> 01:56:18,853
This is what you say as
between devil and the deep sea.

1777
01:56:19,661 --> 01:56:20,526
Who is this girl?

1778
01:56:21,564 --> 01:56:22,293
I beg you.

1779
01:56:24,002 --> 01:56:25,526
What's this Vamsi, Seenu and Ravi?

1780
01:56:27,406 --> 01:56:28,396
When did you come?

1781
01:56:28,709 --> 01:56:31,737
You sent me here, did you bother
to call me at least once?

1782
01:56:31,947 --> 01:56:34,918
I mean I've short term memory loss.

1783
01:56:35,119 --> 01:56:37,418
What would you like to have?
Coffee ortea?

1784
01:56:37,622 --> 01:56:38,486
Is it necessary now?

1785
01:56:38,691 --> 01:56:43,653
You said I'll forget you all
once I come here getting busy.

1786
01:56:43,965 --> 01:56:47,494
Look, I'm idle here.
Wait, I'll get you coffee.

1787
01:56:48,206 --> 01:56:50,835
Sathi, three coffees to uncles.

1788
01:57:03,729 --> 01:57:05,630
Oh my God!
How do you live in that house?

1789
01:57:05,833 --> 01:57:07,198
He made us go crazy in 15 minutes.

1790
01:57:07,836 --> 01:57:08,803
Have you got it now?

1791
01:57:10,073 --> 01:57:11,632
Why did they go away Siddhu?

1792
01:57:11,842 --> 01:57:14,038
I was getting them coffees.
-Are you mad?

1793
01:57:15,281 --> 01:57:16,543
What did I do?

1794
01:57:17,584 --> 01:57:19,883
What have you done?
You've done a great job.

1795
01:57:20,321 --> 01:57:22,382
Is it my mistake to ask your
friends to stay for a coffee?

1796
01:57:22,592 --> 01:57:24,823
Will these fools die if you
don't offerthem coffees?

1797
01:57:25,096 --> 01:57:27,292
I'm already tensed overyour spilling
the beans about the loan matter.

1798
01:57:27,499 --> 01:57:29,229
You said hello to my friends
and embarrassed me again.

1799
01:57:29,436 --> 01:57:30,232
Are you mad?

1800
01:57:30,604 --> 01:57:33,905
How do I know what had
happened inside?

1801
01:57:34,110 --> 01:57:35,408
Yes, you don't know anything,

1802
01:57:35,612 --> 01:57:37,911
you don't know how to behave
and talk to people,

1803
01:57:38,116 --> 01:57:40,586
you don't know why you're here,
you don't know anything, right?

1804
01:57:40,787 --> 01:57:41,845
No Siddhu...

1805
01:57:42,290 --> 01:57:43,086
Hang the phone.

1806
01:57:44,126 --> 01:57:44,922
You do it.

1807
01:57:45,127 --> 01:57:45,593
I told you to hang it.

1808
01:57:45,795 --> 01:57:48,264
Somebody please do it,
I must talk to my second wife.

1809
01:57:52,638 --> 01:57:53,765
I'm confused Lakshmi.

1810
01:57:55,310 --> 01:57:57,438
I thought the girl was his only problem.

1811
01:57:58,748 --> 01:58:01,946
I thought I could explain him
and solve it but today....

1812
01:58:04,157 --> 01:58:07,286
But...one thing is clear.

1813
01:58:08,663 --> 01:58:13,126
The girl isn't his only problem.
There is something else.

1814
01:58:29,630 --> 01:58:30,995
Uncle...uncle.

1815
01:58:34,603 --> 01:58:35,935
I'm really sorry Siddhu.

1816
01:58:37,208 --> 01:58:38,836
If you want touch me once.

1817
01:59:54,761 --> 01:59:56,958
Sathi, see a new uncle has come.

1818
01:59:58,333 --> 02:00:00,803
Oh my God! Why is he here now?

1819
02:00:01,004 --> 02:00:02,302
Father is inside uncle.

1820
02:00:02,507 --> 02:00:04,305
You know him?!

1821
02:00:04,843 --> 02:00:06,311
Welcome, what a surprise!

1822
02:00:07,013 --> 02:00:08,811
Sorry kinsman, I dropped in suddenly.

1823
02:00:09,016 --> 02:00:09,642
No problem.

1824
02:00:10,919 --> 02:00:13,151
Shall I bring you a BP tablet?
-Ask loudly.

1825
02:00:13,357 --> 02:00:15,986
Shall I bring a BP tablet?
- Bring.

1826
02:00:16,261 --> 02:00:18,093
One for me too.
- Tea or coffee?

1827
02:00:18,532 --> 02:00:20,330
I asked for a tablet, not tea or coffee.

1828
02:00:22,538 --> 02:00:23,904
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1829
02:00:26,544 --> 02:00:27,442
Why is he calling me?

1830
02:00:27,779 --> 02:00:29,907
Yourfather-in-law is here.
- Is he here?

1831
02:00:30,383 --> 02:00:31,111
Why did he come now?

1832
02:00:31,318 --> 02:00:33,014
Hasini is playing with kids next to him.

1833
02:00:33,221 --> 02:00:34,518
Why don't you tell me one good news?

1834
02:00:35,057 --> 02:00:36,524
He has brought wedding invitations.

1835
02:00:36,893 --> 02:00:38,019
A good news!

1836
02:00:40,599 --> 02:00:42,534
I came to give the first invitation to you.

1837
02:00:42,735 --> 02:00:43,702
Come son-in-law, please sit.

1838
02:00:44,071 --> 02:00:46,040
Are you fine? Actually...

1839
02:00:46,241 --> 02:00:49,040
Aunty...one more riddle.

1840
02:00:49,513 --> 02:00:52,540
Okay, three ants were going in a queue.

1841
02:00:53,252 --> 02:00:56,051
First ant said,
there are two ants behind me.

1842
02:00:56,423 --> 02:00:59,292
Second ant said,
there's one ant behind me.

1843
02:00:59,862 --> 02:01:03,391
Third ant said,
there are two ants behind me.

1844
02:01:03,767 --> 02:01:04,894
How is it possible?

1845
02:01:05,103 --> 02:01:06,071
How is it possible?

1846
02:01:06,272 --> 02:01:07,570
That's what I too asked.

1847
02:01:08,108 --> 02:01:09,075
Do you know kinsman?

1848
02:01:10,111 --> 02:01:12,740
That is...may be they are
going in a circle.

1849
02:01:14,117 --> 02:01:19,251
No, if they are in a circle, the second ant
should also say two behind it.

1850
02:01:20,461 --> 02:01:21,086
Isn't it?

1851
02:01:22,130 --> 02:01:22,926
Okay, you answer it dear.

1852
02:01:23,131 --> 02:01:24,599
May I? May I?

1853
02:01:25,635 --> 02:01:28,606
Third ant lied!

1854
02:01:30,910 --> 02:01:34,211
Kinsman, we got it wrong,
it seems the ant lied.

1855
02:01:37,587 --> 02:01:38,349
Bye.

1856
02:01:39,056 --> 02:01:40,285
Bye...bye.

1857
02:01:41,993 --> 02:01:45,955
How can an ant lie?
-Your BP tablet.

1858
02:01:46,167 --> 02:01:49,366
No need, the girl eased it with her wit.

1859
02:01:51,175 --> 02:01:52,904
By the way, who is she?

1860
02:01:53,178 --> 02:01:53,644
She is...

1861
02:01:53,845 --> 02:01:54,813
My friend uncle.

1862
02:01:56,015 --> 02:01:58,382
Whoever she may be, she's an angel.
- Isn't she?

1863
02:02:00,021 --> 02:02:02,651
Bye...bye...bye tablet.

1864
02:02:13,543 --> 02:02:14,772
It's Butchi Kanaka Rao!

1865
02:02:16,648 --> 02:02:18,844
If I answer it's problem,
if I don't even then it's a problem.

1866
02:02:19,051 --> 02:02:21,350
My chain of lies has started.
God save me.

1867
02:02:21,722 --> 02:02:24,352
How long do you take
to pick up the phone?

1868
02:02:24,994 --> 02:02:26,189
Give it to my daughter,
I want to talk to her.

1869
02:02:26,396 --> 02:02:28,024
Daughter? Dear, it's dad.

1870
02:02:28,566 --> 02:02:30,865
Daughter...my daughter...not my daughter...

1871
02:02:31,069 --> 02:02:33,539
Every time you cut the call
citing some silly reason,

1872
02:02:33,741 --> 02:02:36,370
today I must talk to my daughter.
Give the phone to her.

1873
02:02:36,579 --> 02:02:40,381
How can I sir?
She's somewhere else and I'm here.

1874
02:02:40,585 --> 02:02:41,381
Why elsewhere?

1875
02:02:41,586 --> 02:02:43,714
That is ...it's an excursion.

1876
02:02:43,923 --> 02:02:46,222
Bird chirpings, parrots singing,

1877
02:02:46,427 --> 02:02:49,226
gushing rivers, waterfalls,
they are enjoying it to the hilt.

1878
02:02:49,432 --> 02:02:51,901
Waterfalls? I don't hear anything.

1879
02:02:52,603 --> 02:02:53,229
You want sound.

1880
02:02:53,772 --> 02:02:55,900
You want to hearthe sound, right?
One minute.

1881
02:02:56,442 --> 02:03:00,745
You'll hearthe sound now.
I've come nearthe waterfalls.

1882
02:03:00,949 --> 02:03:03,145
I've come very close to it. Hear it.

1883
02:03:03,787 --> 02:03:04,755
Can you hear it?

1884
02:03:04,989 --> 02:03:08,757
I can hear it.
My daughter doesn't know to swim.

1885
02:03:09,162 --> 02:03:11,097
Anyway you've come there,
give the phone to my daughter.

1886
02:03:11,299 --> 02:03:12,766
Daughter? I'm in a fix.

1887
02:03:13,869 --> 02:03:16,270
Sir, I feel very shy to go
nearyour daughter.

1888
02:03:16,473 --> 02:03:17,941
Why are you feeling shy
to give herthe phone?

1889
02:03:18,142 --> 02:03:20,442
Because she's taking bath.

1890
02:03:20,647 --> 02:03:23,276
What are you doing nearthe place
my daughter is taking bath?

1891
02:03:23,484 --> 02:03:26,614
You call me often and
suspect me always,

1892
02:03:26,823 --> 02:03:28,917
I don't want to deny you anything,
talk to your daughter now.

1893
02:03:29,159 --> 02:03:31,959
Nothing like that, please don't go
anywhere near my daughter.

1894
02:03:32,164 --> 02:03:33,632
Talk to her sir, let hertake bath.

1895
02:03:33,834 --> 02:03:35,962
Hang up the phone!

1896
02:03:38,006 --> 02:03:40,977
Thank God! I'm out of trouble once again.

1897
02:03:42,581 --> 02:03:46,314
I accepted this when they said
I'll become famous in college.

1898
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:48,148
Not famous but infamous.

1899
02:03:49,057 --> 02:03:50,025
It's very nice.

1900
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:52,528
Very nice father.
-Very nice.

1901
02:03:53,097 --> 02:03:54,530
Come to Board of Directors'
meetings dressed like this.

1902
02:03:55,134 --> 02:03:56,864
How well dressed others
come to the meetings.

1903
02:03:57,170 --> 02:03:59,696
I felt let down by his dress,
so I got him this dress.

1904
02:03:59,907 --> 02:04:00,966
Isn't it good?
- Okay father.

1905
02:04:01,176 --> 02:04:01,767
That's it.

1906
02:04:03,679 --> 02:04:05,545
Siddhu, come here.

1907
02:04:06,751 --> 02:04:07,719
I too got one foryou.

1908
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:09,548
Some day you too have
to come to office.

1909
02:04:11,092 --> 02:04:12,787
It will suit you.

1910
02:04:13,595 --> 02:04:16,064
Siddhu, new coat? Very nice.

1911
02:04:17,001 --> 02:04:18,731
But you don't like white.

1912
02:04:19,938 --> 02:04:21,736
You go inside. It's nice.

1913
02:04:23,610 --> 02:04:25,910
You don't like white, right?
- Go.

1914
02:04:26,615 --> 02:04:27,674
It's really nice, father.

1915
02:04:32,558 --> 02:04:37,999
Are you doing it wantonly
or unwittingly? I don't know.

1916
02:04:39,202 --> 02:04:41,000
Will you behave like
a good son with yourfather?

1917
02:04:44,143 --> 02:04:46,510
Idiot! You are...

1918
02:04:51,988 --> 02:04:53,616
I abused myself.

1919
02:04:54,492 --> 02:04:57,292
You needn't go out
to call me on phone.

1920
02:05:01,769 --> 02:05:04,797
Thank God! You smiled.

1921
02:05:07,846 --> 02:05:09,314
Sathi, get the car ready.

1922
02:05:09,516 --> 02:05:11,644
Don't move.- Look she's trying to
make me a new bride.

1923
02:05:11,852 --> 02:05:13,821
Do it fast, we'll reach only
afterthe marriage.

1924
02:05:14,623 --> 02:05:15,147
Where is Siddhu?

1925
02:05:15,358 --> 02:05:17,657
Father-in-law, Siddhu & my husband have
gone out to buy a gift to Vamsi.

1926
02:05:18,028 --> 02:05:19,894
Hasini is also coming with us, right?

1927
02:05:25,874 --> 02:05:27,900
Aren't you coming to the marriage?

1928
02:05:28,144 --> 02:05:30,010
We are coming.

1929
02:05:32,885 --> 02:05:36,117
They are coming it seems, Sathi,
I'll go along with them,

1930
02:05:36,323 --> 02:05:37,450
I don't need an auto.

1931
02:05:52,481 --> 02:05:54,541
Do you remember all my instructions?

1932
02:05:54,752 --> 02:05:57,722
must be silent, decent and
stay calm. That's all, right?

1933
02:05:57,923 --> 02:05:58,549
All three mean the same, right?

1934
02:05:58,758 --> 02:06:02,093
All three look the same but
very difficult to maintain it.

1935
02:06:02,264 --> 02:06:03,231
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

1936
02:06:03,432 --> 02:06:05,401
I'm very happy that you've graced
the occasion with yourfamily.

1937
02:06:06,437 --> 02:06:07,735
Bujji is finished.

1938
02:06:09,775 --> 02:06:10,571
Am I not telling you?

1939
02:06:22,228 --> 02:06:23,252
Why are you calling me aunt in public?

1940
02:06:23,463 --> 02:06:24,590
Have I embarrassed you?

1941
02:06:24,798 --> 02:06:26,426
Forget about this,

1942
02:06:26,968 --> 02:06:31,101
It looks like Siddhu is trying very hard
to keep embarrassments away.

1943
02:06:31,576 --> 02:06:33,442
I'm trying hard to save
my honour in my own home.

1944
02:06:33,646 --> 02:06:35,444
Forget it, by the way
what's the final result?

1945
02:06:35,815 --> 02:06:37,113
I studied something else and
writing something else.

1946
02:06:37,918 --> 02:06:39,113
I'm confused.

1947
02:06:43,394 --> 02:06:46,126
Don't you like this marriage, Manju?

1948
02:06:46,499 --> 02:06:47,626
Looks like she's out to
spoil my marriage.

1949
02:06:47,834 --> 02:06:49,302
I loved him to marry.

1950
02:06:52,174 --> 02:06:53,472
Why are you so shabbily dressed then?

1951
02:06:53,677 --> 02:06:56,705
Come here.

1952
02:06:57,849 --> 02:07:01,048
Come to do the bridal make up.
- Coming.

1953
02:07:07,699 --> 02:07:08,495
What's this new get up sir?

1954
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:09,827
What else can I do?

1955
02:07:10,035 --> 02:07:12,664
You said love excursion,
I said holiday sight seeing.

1956
02:07:12,873 --> 02:07:13,931
He said be careful.

1957
02:07:14,141 --> 02:07:19,013
That man is calling every hourto
talk to his daughter and killing me.

1958
02:07:19,216 --> 02:07:21,014
Why are you worried sir?
Just two more days only.

1959
02:07:21,219 --> 02:07:23,347
Be free like us.
- Is it?

1960
02:07:24,057 --> 02:07:27,961
After hearing you,
I feel little relieved.

1961
02:07:29,799 --> 02:07:30,356
Where is Manju?

1962
02:07:30,567 --> 02:07:32,092
Where is Hasini?

1963
02:07:32,303 --> 02:07:33,032
Where is Charmi?

1964
02:07:33,238 --> 02:07:35,867
Why did you push me?
Is it forfun?

1965
02:07:36,577 --> 02:07:37,373
No serious.

1966
02:07:37,911 --> 02:07:41,872
Serious is okay, I hate fun.
Already I'm tensed.

1967
02:07:42,419 --> 02:07:43,545
Where is Hasini?

1968
02:07:43,755 --> 02:07:44,551
Where is Trisha?

1969
02:07:44,756 --> 02:07:45,553
Who are you?

1970
02:07:47,192 --> 02:07:50,322
Sathi! A good servant.

1971
02:07:50,765 --> 02:07:52,063
A servant should be like servant.

1972
02:07:52,601 --> 02:07:55,572
Is a lecturer like a lecturer?
- I'll be like this.

1973
02:07:56,508 --> 02:07:57,566
How does he know that I'm a lecturer?

1974
02:07:57,776 --> 02:08:00,906
What's this sir? You didn't invite me
to your son's marriage.

1975
02:08:01,281 --> 02:08:04,411
He didn't invite me too,
how can I invite you?

1976
02:08:05,354 --> 02:08:06,413
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1977
02:08:06,956 --> 02:08:11,419
Why are you conducting your
son's marriage in a temple?

1978
02:08:11,631 --> 02:08:13,259
This is too much for what he has done.

1979
02:08:13,967 --> 02:08:14,935
He eloped with her.

1980
02:08:15,804 --> 02:08:17,432
I caught him in Secunderabad station,

1981
02:08:17,807 --> 02:08:20,107
and arranged this marriage
to save my honour.

1982
02:08:21,914 --> 02:08:23,940
Your son is much better
than my son,

1983
02:08:24,417 --> 02:08:29,619
my son threatened to commit suicide
if I didn't agree to his marriage.

1984
02:08:29,992 --> 02:08:31,790
Will you give in if they threaten you?

1985
02:08:32,062 --> 02:08:34,054
Don't we have the right
to think about their welfare?

1986
02:08:34,265 --> 02:08:37,464
You are too much.
They don't need good or bad.

1987
02:08:38,004 --> 02:08:39,472
Look at them!

1988
02:08:43,848 --> 02:08:45,976
Is there anyone well
behaved amongst hem?

1989
02:08:46,351 --> 02:08:48,582
They forget the world
if they get what they wish.

1990
02:08:49,021 --> 02:08:50,080
Respecting us,

1991
02:08:50,357 --> 02:08:53,157
if they come with the girl and say
I love and want to marry her,

1992
02:08:53,362 --> 02:08:55,490
think about it,
won't we think about it positively?

1993
02:08:55,699 --> 02:08:57,565
Won't we think about it positively,
come on tell me?

1994
02:08:57,768 --> 02:08:59,669
Is there anyone amongst
the crowd like that?

1995
02:09:09,787 --> 02:09:10,685
My clothes are getting soiled.

1996
02:09:13,326 --> 02:09:16,125
Look there, seniors meeting
is in progress.

1997
02:09:16,632 --> 02:09:17,826
What are they discussing?

1998
02:09:18,033 --> 02:09:19,058
What will they be discussing?

1999
02:09:19,435 --> 02:09:21,871
They will be abusing their sons as fools.

2000
02:09:22,073 --> 02:09:24,941
Youth is crazy, love is wrong,
they will be saying,

2001
02:09:25,177 --> 02:09:28,774
if we take a girl and tell,
father I love this girl,

2002
02:09:29,117 --> 02:09:32,282
is there at least one father
to think positively about it?

2003
02:09:39,733 --> 02:09:43,763
It's time fortaking the vows,
we must present the sari, come.

2004
02:09:47,713 --> 02:09:48,372
Did I disturb you?

2005
02:09:49,081 --> 02:09:51,381
No..no...we were discussing
about sons...

2006
02:09:52,286 --> 02:09:53,083
What have they done?

2007
02:09:53,622 --> 02:09:55,215
They did what they wanted to do.

2008
02:09:55,525 --> 02:09:57,585
Which these people didn't like it?
That's all!

2009
02:10:30,579 --> 02:10:31,171
What are you up to?

2010
02:10:31,681 --> 02:10:35,585
Uncle will look ugly with horns.
- Shut up! If you butt him again...

2011
02:10:36,221 --> 02:10:38,053
Leave me...leave me.

2012
02:10:38,558 --> 02:10:40,117
Why do you always boss over me?

2013
02:10:40,928 --> 02:10:41,622
Okay, promise not to butt him.

2014
02:10:42,064 --> 02:10:44,056
I'll try.
- Try?

2015
02:10:44,868 --> 02:10:46,234
Granny, look what he's doing.

2016
02:10:46,437 --> 02:10:48,668
It's common in love.
You carry on son.

2017
02:10:50,243 --> 02:10:52,678
It's time to tie the knot,
play the band.

2018
02:10:55,317 --> 02:10:56,478
Ready...tie the knot.

2019
02:11:05,467 --> 02:11:07,561
How grandly I wished to
celebrate his marriage!

2020
02:11:07,770 --> 02:11:09,762
I had to see this!

2021
02:11:10,407 --> 02:11:11,932
Okay, it's over now, forget it.

2022
02:11:13,913 --> 02:11:14,504
Uncle, come.

2023
02:11:39,252 --> 02:11:41,118
Near Lal Darwaza...

2024
02:11:41,422 --> 02:11:43,448
Near Golkonda fort...

2025
02:11:43,659 --> 02:11:47,654
On the Banks of River Yamuna...
Drums are being played...

2026
02:11:48,133 --> 02:11:52,231
Whether it is Italy or England or our India...

2027
02:11:52,539 --> 02:11:56,501
Love is love wherever it is...

2028
02:11:56,946 --> 02:12:01,180
Oh God! Is it fair?

2029
02:12:01,386 --> 02:12:05,188
Why do elders are always against love?

2030
02:12:05,927 --> 02:12:10,025
Oh God! What's this trouble?

2031
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:14,669
Weren't these elders youth
once upon a time?

2032
02:12:15,441 --> 02:12:16,534
What do you really want to say?

2033
02:13:01,212 --> 02:13:03,204
Did we ask when you beat us?

2034
02:13:03,415 --> 02:13:05,408
Did we ask to thrash you?

2035
02:13:05,620 --> 02:13:09,888
Did we fed you with love
on your request?

2036
02:13:10,093 --> 02:13:12,085
Did we say no?

2037
02:13:12,296 --> 02:13:14,265
Did we pinpoint it to you?

2038
02:13:14,466 --> 02:13:18,872
We never suspected your love
and affection.

2039
02:13:19,073 --> 02:13:22,909
If you really respect us so much,
why all this drama then?

2040
02:13:23,581 --> 02:13:27,349
Will children forget us
afterfalling in love?

2041
02:13:28,054 --> 02:13:31,822
You want us to marry your choice
for bringing up us for 25 years...

2042
02:13:32,427 --> 02:13:36,958
You want us to punish
all ourfuture life forthat...

2043
02:13:38,069 --> 02:13:38,661
So...

2044
02:13:58,968 --> 02:14:01,335
Come aunty...please come aunty.

2045
02:14:01,539 --> 02:14:02,006
No.

2046
02:14:02,207 --> 02:14:04,108
Do you know aunty
is a very good singer?

2047
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:08,510
Mother please...aunty please...

2048
02:14:17,263 --> 02:14:19,255
O greatest flautist!

2049
02:14:19,633 --> 02:14:21,534
Come fast...

2050
02:14:21,771 --> 02:14:25,971
Radha is waiting foryou here...

2051
02:14:26,177 --> 02:14:30,479
O Butterthief!
Don't delay any further...

2052
02:14:30,751 --> 02:14:34,690
I'm chanting your name...

2053
02:14:35,191 --> 02:14:45,437
A virgin is waiting yearning
foryou underthe tree...

2054
02:14:46,242 --> 02:14:49,907
There's a little hidden in my heart...

2055
02:15:07,708 --> 02:15:10,177
They talk about love...

2056
02:15:10,412 --> 02:15:12,381
They chant love mantra...

2057
02:15:12,582 --> 02:15:16,885
You forget reality in
the dreamy youth...

2058
02:15:17,089 --> 02:15:19,149
You create trouble...

2059
02:15:19,359 --> 02:15:21,328
You blare over loud speakers...

2060
02:15:21,663 --> 02:15:25,602
You never accept
young lovers with heart...

2061
02:15:26,037 --> 02:15:29,805
You never give up
your adamant attitude...

2062
02:15:30,477 --> 02:15:34,473
Decide between us or love,
right now...

2063
02:15:34,884 --> 02:15:38,788
We can't compare your affection
with our love for a girl...

2064
02:15:39,357 --> 02:15:43,956
We can't decide between the two eyes...

2065
02:15:55,115 --> 02:15:56,708
Siddhu, Hasini's father!

2066
02:15:59,855 --> 02:16:00,550
Hasini....

2067
02:16:01,859 --> 02:16:03,224
What happened?
-Yourfather.

2068
02:16:05,097 --> 02:16:06,895
Hey buffalo! Why are you falling me?

2069
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:07,931
Go...go...hide.

2070
02:16:12,241 --> 02:16:13,766
Are you drunk?
Go...go away from here.

2071
02:16:14,077 --> 02:16:14,567
Don't come here drunk.

2072
02:16:14,913 --> 02:16:17,382
Who are you falling on me? Go out.

2073
02:16:18,485 --> 02:16:19,110
Why did you come again?

2074
02:16:39,885 --> 02:16:42,218
What happened?
Why are you rushing out?

2075
02:16:42,488 --> 02:16:43,079
My father.

2076
02:16:43,691 --> 02:16:47,025
What's this nuisance? Stop it!

2077
02:17:02,219 --> 02:17:03,277
Who are you?

2078
02:17:04,122 --> 02:17:05,351
Is it you?!

2079
02:17:15,272 --> 02:17:16,205
What did I do?

2080
02:17:16,608 --> 02:17:17,165
What else is left foryou to do?

2081
02:17:18,010 --> 02:17:18,568
What you should've done?

2082
02:17:19,178 --> 02:17:20,271
I told you many things before
going to the marriage.

2083
02:17:20,648 --> 02:17:21,444
Did you follow at least one?

2084
02:17:22,317 --> 02:17:24,252
I thought it's okay if you behave
decently before my dad.

2085
02:17:24,687 --> 02:17:26,918
Despite my warnings,
how dare you butt him?

2086
02:17:28,092 --> 02:17:30,892
Not enough with your antics,
your goddamn fathertoo...

2087
02:17:31,731 --> 02:17:32,664
You're abusing me, right?

2088
02:17:33,100 --> 02:17:34,260
Why are you abusing my father?

2089
02:17:34,670 --> 02:17:35,602
He deserves it.

2090
02:17:36,572 --> 02:17:38,302
He came drunk to the temple
and created a scene.

2091
02:17:38,809 --> 02:17:41,837
Don't you abuse yourfather
after getting drunk?

2092
02:17:43,049 --> 02:17:44,381
Don't talk as if you're a good man.

2093
02:17:46,654 --> 02:17:48,054
Don't talk like this again.

2094
02:18:24,813 --> 02:18:26,714
It's me!

2095
02:18:27,016 --> 02:18:27,779
Don't you have any sense?

2096
02:18:28,886 --> 02:18:29,785
Aren't you satisfied with
the damage already done?

2097
02:18:29,988 --> 02:18:31,047
Do you've to mention about
my drinking habit too?

2098
02:18:31,491 --> 02:18:34,120
I said sorry, please leave it.

2099
02:18:34,462 --> 02:18:36,328
Do you know how my image
was in my home?

2100
02:18:37,133 --> 02:18:38,260
It's totally disfigured now.

2101
02:18:39,102 --> 02:18:41,571
Forthem now I'm a rogue...
a drunkard...

2102
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:43,968
How can you become so cheap instantly?

2103
02:18:44,410 --> 02:18:46,140
Anyway they will come to
know about this someday.

2104
02:18:46,614 --> 02:18:47,240
You don't talk.

2105
02:18:48,150 --> 02:18:51,610
How my parents will bad for not bringing
me up in a disciplined manner?

2106
02:18:52,389 --> 02:18:53,414
Will I have any value with them?

2107
02:18:53,992 --> 02:18:54,960
Will they accept our marriage?

2108
02:18:55,828 --> 02:18:57,126
What's my father's idea is?

2109
02:18:58,266 --> 02:18:59,255
I shudderto think too.

2110
02:18:59,868 --> 02:19:01,460
Won't you think about me?

2111
02:19:01,938 --> 02:19:03,371
I love you, right?
What else do you want?

2112
02:19:03,707 --> 02:19:04,867
Think before you utter anything.

2113
02:19:05,243 --> 02:19:07,235
You did the mistake and
should I think about it?

2114
02:19:07,814 --> 02:19:09,043
Should I?

2115
02:19:11,419 --> 02:19:11,885
What?

2116
02:19:28,846 --> 02:19:30,280
Hasini.
- Come home, son.

2117
02:19:40,030 --> 02:19:42,226
How long will you think? Go home.

2118
02:19:43,001 --> 02:19:44,469
I'm scared to go home.

2119
02:19:45,305 --> 02:19:47,000
Seven day test ends today.

2120
02:19:47,275 --> 02:19:48,742
Can you live without Hasini?

2121
02:19:50,747 --> 02:19:51,771
Why hesitation then? Go home.

2122
02:19:52,617 --> 02:19:54,084
What yourfather decides
tomorrow isn't important,

2123
02:19:54,285 --> 02:19:55,275
what you decide tomorrow
is more important.

2124
02:19:56,723 --> 02:19:57,690
If a necessity arises,
go against him.

2125
02:20:16,820 --> 02:20:17,479
Why are you laughing now?

2126
02:20:17,688 --> 02:20:20,625
Siddhu sirtoo did same like this
when he came to office.

2127
02:20:29,006 --> 02:20:31,601
Your kinsman is on the line,
can I give him the call?

2128
02:20:34,080 --> 02:20:35,548
Say I'm busy and will call him later.

2129
02:20:40,757 --> 02:20:45,527
Father, building work is over,
we've to decide about the painting.

2130
02:20:45,932 --> 02:20:47,833
This is what we use regularly,
it is good,

2131
02:20:48,436 --> 02:20:49,870
this is new product,

2132
02:20:50,072 --> 02:20:53,441
it will be good if it clicks,
if you decide between these two...

2133
02:20:56,282 --> 02:20:57,146
Let's decide it tomorrow.

2134
02:20:59,219 --> 02:21:00,312
Are you thinking about tomorrow?

2135
02:21:03,626 --> 02:21:05,595
He hasn't got used to this like me.

2136
02:21:06,864 --> 02:21:08,891
Anyway whateveryou do
is for our benefit only.

2137
02:21:16,146 --> 02:21:17,272
Gautham.
- Father.

2138
02:21:17,881 --> 02:21:20,909
No need to take risk,
okay the regular old brand.

2139
02:21:44,189 --> 02:21:50,028
Sir...sir...father is calling you.

2140
02:22:24,184 --> 02:22:24,843
Had your breakfast?

2141
02:22:30,828 --> 02:22:35,767
Everybody here knows me
well as a father,

2142
02:22:38,273 --> 02:22:39,604
I'm not alone,

2143
02:22:41,177 --> 02:22:43,340
all of you together is me,

2144
02:22:44,382 --> 02:22:46,078
I'm also not alone, father.

2145
02:22:47,154 --> 02:22:49,055
I know it.
I've understood it.

2146
02:22:50,491 --> 02:22:53,257
I never went wrong as yourfather,
and never will in future too.

2147
02:22:55,833 --> 02:22:56,858
So I've come to a decision.

2148
02:22:58,204 --> 02:22:59,729
I too have come to a decision.
- Let me finish it first.

2149
02:23:01,308 --> 02:23:03,744
First listen to me.
- I started it first, right?

2150
02:23:04,647 --> 02:23:05,205
Father please...

2151
02:23:07,318 --> 02:23:08,512
Can I say something uncle?

2152
02:23:11,824 --> 02:23:12,450
Hasini, one minute.

2153
02:23:13,027 --> 02:23:14,689
Father, I...
- Uncle, I am rejecting him.

2154
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:17,997
I'm leaving.

2155
02:23:27,015 --> 02:23:28,448
I don't know how to talk uncle,

2156
02:23:29,552 --> 02:23:32,489
now also I intruded into
your conversation,

2157
02:23:33,358 --> 02:23:35,259
I don't know whether
this is right or wrong,

2158
02:23:36,897 --> 02:23:40,699
but I feel I'm not suitable for Siddhu.

2159
02:23:44,642 --> 02:23:46,634
When you told him to bring me here,

2160
02:23:47,347 --> 02:23:50,944
I had doubts how you could know
about a person in 7 days,

2161
02:23:52,287 --> 02:23:56,226
but I've come to know after
coming here that we can,

2162
02:23:57,863 --> 02:24:01,163
I don't know what you've
come to know about me,

2163
02:24:02,103 --> 02:24:05,506
but I've come to know
a lot about Siddhu,

2164
02:24:08,445 --> 02:24:10,642
Once he told to me talk
few words if it is possible,

2165
02:24:11,450 --> 02:24:13,248
now he asks me not to utter a word.

2166
02:24:16,692 --> 02:24:19,526
Earlier he used to call on phone
to say sweet nothings,

2167
02:24:20,765 --> 02:24:22,700
now he calls on phone
only to scold me.

2168
02:24:27,575 --> 02:24:29,567
What he liked in me once,

2169
02:24:31,348 --> 02:24:32,873
today he says he doesn't like it.

2170
02:24:37,290 --> 02:24:39,589
But I'm not leaving because
Siddhu is abusing me.

2171
02:24:40,595 --> 02:24:42,723
He used to do it earliertoo.

2172
02:24:44,234 --> 02:24:45,759
It had traces of love in it.

2173
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:48,773
Now it is missing.

2174
02:24:55,085 --> 02:24:59,581
I neverfelt loneliness in my home
when I was alone also,

2175
02:25:00,393 --> 02:25:03,592
though there are so many
people around me here,

2176
02:25:03,898 --> 02:25:05,230
I feel lonely.

2177
02:25:10,609 --> 02:25:14,377
I'm not a hypocrite to behave differently
inside and outside the home.

2178
02:25:15,716 --> 02:25:21,419
I'm scared of becoming a hypocrite
if I stay here, so I'm leaving.

2179
02:25:25,499 --> 02:25:28,732
I came here like a guest and
leaving like a guest.

2180
02:25:30,740 --> 02:25:35,179
If I had hurt anyone here,
please forgive me.

2181
02:25:41,122 --> 02:25:41,612
Bye aunty.

2182
02:25:44,928 --> 02:25:45,918
I got an auto foryou.

2183
02:26:20,784 --> 02:26:21,809
You promised to tell me a story.

2184
02:26:24,423 --> 02:26:26,893
Though it is unbelievable truth...

2185
02:26:27,161 --> 02:26:29,494
Though I know you'll never come back...

2186
02:26:29,764 --> 02:26:33,293
Why isn't my heart accepting the truth?

2187
02:26:35,173 --> 02:26:37,540
Anyone passing before me...

2188
02:26:37,878 --> 02:26:40,177
I think it is you...

2189
02:26:40,515 --> 02:26:45,080
Your image is permanently
etched in my eyes...

2190
02:26:45,756 --> 02:26:48,021
Though I am in crowd...

2191
02:26:48,260 --> 02:26:50,696
I'm still lonely...

2192
02:26:51,098 --> 02:26:56,300
In the world of loneliness
you left behind for me...

2193
02:26:56,573 --> 02:26:58,508
Though eyes are wide open...

2194
02:26:58,843 --> 02:27:01,405
Though you are a past dream...

2195
02:27:01,948 --> 02:27:05,852
I'm still wandering in that dream...

2196
02:27:27,454 --> 02:27:29,582
You said you got 99 marks
in Mathematics,

2197
02:27:31,093 --> 02:27:32,287
I signed it,

2198
02:27:33,530 --> 02:27:35,089
I told you to be docile,

2199
02:27:35,466 --> 02:27:36,297
you said impossible,

2200
02:27:37,804 --> 02:27:39,465
you said you'll live a life
of your own choice,

2201
02:27:39,740 --> 02:27:41,139
I said okay,

2202
02:27:41,676 --> 02:27:44,339
do you know why I gave you
this freedom of choice?

2203
02:27:46,918 --> 02:27:49,479
I trust my daughter.

2204
02:27:51,458 --> 02:27:53,620
You broke it.

2205
02:27:54,896 --> 02:27:58,356
Hereafter I'll follow your orders.

2206
02:27:58,702 --> 02:28:03,540
In the moonlight of
yourfriendship...

2207
02:28:04,378 --> 02:28:09,011
Can I take it as I spent
few days in that bliss?

2208
02:28:09,419 --> 02:28:11,445
In my thoughts...

2209
02:28:11,856 --> 02:28:14,258
In the pain I go through...

2210
02:28:14,861 --> 02:28:19,665
This night of pain is never ending...

2211
02:28:20,536 --> 02:28:22,528
Friendship of smiles...

2212
02:28:23,207 --> 02:28:25,676
Fragrance of bonding...

2213
02:28:25,878 --> 02:28:29,281
The boon of first love
that I lost forever...

2214
02:30:07,135 --> 02:30:08,626
Hello kinsman! It's me.

2215
02:30:09,471 --> 02:30:11,804
Thank God I got you on phone
after 3 days of try.

2216
02:30:13,177 --> 02:30:15,909
Sorry, I forgot in my busy
work schedules.

2217
02:30:16,115 --> 02:30:19,347
My tension is raising everyday,
because I'm father of the bride.

2218
02:30:19,721 --> 02:30:20,779
Marriage date is fast approaching,

2219
02:30:21,056 --> 02:30:22,991
we haven't decided about many things,

2220
02:30:23,193 --> 02:30:24,387
let's meet and decide immediately.

2221
02:30:25,630 --> 02:30:28,156
I'll come & meet you in 2 days,
I'm really sorry sir.

2222
02:30:28,434 --> 02:30:29,231
Okay, bye.

2223
02:30:29,436 --> 02:30:30,095
Okay.

2224
02:30:37,448 --> 02:30:40,908
Why are you so dull?

2225
02:30:42,956 --> 02:30:44,652
You've seen, haven't you?
They are making calls,

2226
02:30:44,960 --> 02:30:46,018
what am I to answerthem?

2227
02:30:47,097 --> 02:30:47,563
They are actually...

2228
02:30:50,067 --> 02:30:51,399
Don't put longface, I hate it.

2229
02:30:51,970 --> 02:30:53,802
Please tell him.

2230
02:30:56,244 --> 02:30:56,835
Tell him.

2231
02:30:58,614 --> 02:31:00,583
Why are you also gloomy as if
something bad had happened?

2232
02:31:03,889 --> 02:31:05,118
Why is everyone so dull?

2233
02:31:07,261 --> 02:31:09,321
What can I do if the girl
leaves on her own?

2234
02:31:10,967 --> 02:31:11,956
I did what I can do.

2235
02:31:12,937 --> 02:31:15,999
Will any father accept for any girl
to stay in home for 7 days?

2236
02:31:16,208 --> 02:31:18,177
Why did I accept? For him.

2237
02:31:20,181 --> 02:31:22,275
She left on her own.
What can I do?

2238
02:31:23,620 --> 02:31:24,678
It's good that she left.

2239
02:31:25,523 --> 02:31:27,048
She couldn't stay here for 7 days.

2240
02:31:27,259 --> 02:31:28,191
Would she live here all her life?

2241
02:31:28,861 --> 02:31:30,887
Siddhu, face reality at least now,

2242
02:31:31,365 --> 02:31:32,492
you don't know what you really want.

2243
02:31:33,635 --> 02:31:34,159
Do you know?

2244
02:31:35,204 --> 02:31:37,834
What?
- Do you really know what he wants?

2245
02:31:38,176 --> 02:31:39,644
Did I bring him up all these years
without knowing that?-Yes.

2246
02:31:40,279 --> 02:31:41,907
What?
- I'll go hammer & tongs at you.

2247
02:31:43,317 --> 02:31:44,648
Why are you talking about the girl?

2248
02:31:45,087 --> 02:31:46,384
What do you know about him?

2249
02:31:46,823 --> 02:31:49,224
Will children behave the same
outside like in home? No.

2250
02:31:49,693 --> 02:31:51,252
Do you know how he
behaves outside this home?

2251
02:31:51,696 --> 02:31:53,722
He jumps walls at midnight,
he tells lies,

2252
02:31:54,034 --> 02:31:55,729
he beats people outside,
he drinks,

2253
02:31:56,004 --> 02:31:57,130
do you know what he does
after a drinking bout?

2254
02:31:57,472 --> 02:31:58,940
Mother!
-After a drinking bout?

2255
02:31:59,208 --> 02:32:00,801
Isn't it enough if I say he drinks?

2256
02:32:01,879 --> 02:32:02,607
Mother, please leave it.

2257
02:32:03,047 --> 02:32:06,109
I'm not talking about yourfuture,
I'm talking about my son's future.

2258
02:32:08,055 --> 02:32:09,614
You did the mistake but
accusing him.- Me?

2259
02:32:09,824 --> 02:32:10,382
Mother please...
-You did...

2260
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:11,858
Did I commit...
- Father...

2261
02:32:13,063 --> 02:32:14,895
Why are you requesting him?
- Mother, please!

2262
02:32:16,435 --> 02:32:18,768
I did the wrong,
I'll come to the office from tomorrow.

2263
02:32:19,406 --> 02:32:20,135
I'll marry the girl you fixed.

2264
02:32:24,447 --> 02:32:26,006
Siddhu, wait.

2265
02:32:27,352 --> 02:32:32,418
She accuses me and you're leaving
accepting it as your mistake.

2266
02:32:32,627 --> 02:32:33,491
What's going on here?

2267
02:32:34,296 --> 02:32:37,357
I always think about this family's welfare,
is that my fault?

2268
02:32:38,335 --> 02:32:41,932
I strive every minute to give my children
a good luxurious life, is that my fault?

2269
02:32:42,375 --> 02:32:45,540
Tell me, what is my fault? Tell me.
- It was all yourfault.

2270
02:32:50,888 --> 02:32:51,513
Me?

2271
02:32:54,627 --> 02:32:55,787
It was all yourfault.

2272
02:32:57,632 --> 02:33:00,568
Enough father...l'm fed up with
what you've done all these years.

2273
02:33:01,371 --> 02:33:03,431
Enough of the things I lost,
I don't want to lose anymore.

2274
02:33:05,377 --> 02:33:06,207
What did you lose?

2275
02:33:07,380 --> 02:33:08,541
Still didn't get it?

2276
02:33:10,184 --> 02:33:12,279
What Hasini had when she
came to this house,

2277
02:33:12,722 --> 02:33:14,623
what she didn't have when she left
this house, that's what I've lost.

2278
02:33:15,693 --> 02:33:16,251
Happiness.

2279
02:33:17,529 --> 02:33:19,624
Father, I lost happiness of
little pleasures because of you.

2280
02:33:21,201 --> 02:33:23,033
You always thought of making
your son a great man,

2281
02:33:23,339 --> 02:33:24,829
and give him a good life,

2282
02:33:25,675 --> 02:33:28,805
but you never cared to know what I want
and how I want to live my life.

2283
02:33:30,450 --> 02:33:32,419
I always think many times
when it is about you.

2284
02:33:32,786 --> 02:33:36,053
You think every time
it is good for him.

2285
02:33:36,792 --> 02:33:38,727
did you think at least once
whether I'll like it?

2286
02:33:40,298 --> 02:33:42,893
You're satisfied with giving
more than what I ask.

2287
02:33:45,773 --> 02:33:50,303
You don't know the pain of denying
what you really want.

2288
02:33:50,714 --> 02:33:51,806
I know it.

2289
02:33:53,351 --> 02:33:56,652
You'll know my likes & dislikes
only if you talk to me, won't you?

2290
02:33:57,892 --> 02:34:00,191
If there's any problem,
you'll talk to my friends,

2291
02:34:00,896 --> 02:34:02,023
talk to me dad!

2292
02:34:02,332 --> 02:34:04,563
Look into my eyes & tell me,
be friendly with me dad.

2293
02:34:06,305 --> 02:34:07,637
That's what I say every time.

2294
02:34:08,441 --> 02:34:10,741
You'll say but neverfollow it.

2295
02:34:12,047 --> 02:34:14,210
Because you like everything
to happen as you wish.

2296
02:34:15,853 --> 02:34:16,319
This shirt!

2297
02:34:17,021 --> 02:34:18,853
You select it, you say it's super.

2298
02:34:19,426 --> 02:34:21,691
You'll convince me that
it is the best for me.

2299
02:34:22,930 --> 02:34:24,159
Do you know how I feel then?

2300
02:34:25,535 --> 02:34:28,734
I felt like tearing it and
shout hoarsely, I don't like it!

2301
02:34:30,643 --> 02:34:33,204
You'll send me to office,
I'll also go.

2302
02:34:34,649 --> 02:34:36,948
But you'll finish the job
before I reach office.

2303
02:34:39,457 --> 02:34:41,449
Staff in the office jeers at me.

2304
02:34:44,697 --> 02:34:47,190
You invite me to play
a game of carom.

2305
02:34:48,671 --> 02:34:51,835
I want to play but you think
of helping me to win.

2306
02:34:52,610 --> 02:34:53,872
You ask me to strike black, white,

2307
02:34:54,079 --> 02:34:55,843
or say be careful with queen,
you hold my hand and...

2308
02:34:58,853 --> 02:35:00,287
If you play my game too yourself,

2309
02:35:01,591 --> 02:35:02,990
why should I play then dad?

2310
02:35:05,363 --> 02:35:07,855
If you teach me how to eat also...

2311
02:35:10,638 --> 02:35:11,696
...it's not going down the throat, dad.

2312
02:35:17,849 --> 02:35:18,372
You don't know.

2313
02:35:19,786 --> 02:35:22,688
Unable to live as you like,
unable to do what I like,

2314
02:35:22,890 --> 02:35:26,089
I'm living a hell of life, dad.

2315
02:35:27,030 --> 02:35:29,022
Frustration, anger, irritation,

2316
02:35:29,634 --> 02:35:32,298
without knowing where and
how to release it from the system,

2317
02:35:34,742 --> 02:35:36,404
one fine day I shouted
at mother also.

2318
02:35:40,384 --> 02:35:42,148
Mother stopped talking
to me since then.

2319
02:35:47,528 --> 02:35:50,294
When my mother can't
understand why I'm like this,

2320
02:35:54,539 --> 02:35:55,837
how can a girl understand me, dad?

2321
02:36:01,283 --> 02:36:01,942
She left.

2322
02:36:03,587 --> 02:36:07,150
She has gone saying
Siddhu is not suitable for her.

2323
02:36:09,462 --> 02:36:14,129
I promised to give a good family
before inviting her here.

2324
02:36:15,338 --> 02:36:19,402
But I'm saying, this family
has lost a good girl.

2325
02:36:20,813 --> 02:36:21,974
Lost!

2326
02:36:32,165 --> 02:36:33,029
What do you want me to do now?

2327
02:36:34,201 --> 02:36:35,031
I must marry the girl you fixed.

2328
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:38,005
I'll marry but I'm telling you
one thing clearly,

2329
02:36:38,808 --> 02:36:41,973
the things you gave me till now,
this shirt, bike, and otherthings,

2330
02:36:42,346 --> 02:36:44,372
those things don't know I hate them,

2331
02:36:45,752 --> 02:36:47,186
but dad the one coming now is a girl,

2332
02:36:48,122 --> 02:36:50,991
someday she'll find I don't like her,

2333
02:36:51,861 --> 02:36:54,331
you'll feel sad then
about spoiling my life,

2334
02:36:56,135 --> 02:36:58,434
you think you've won
as a fathertill now,

2335
02:37:00,341 --> 02:37:04,336
but to make you win I've been
losing for 24 years, dad.

2336
02:37:07,552 --> 02:37:08,747
Afteryears of losing,

2337
02:37:09,856 --> 02:37:12,088
some fine day when I look
back at my life,

2338
02:37:13,461 --> 02:37:14,929
I'll find only you all over my life.

2339
02:37:16,466 --> 02:37:17,194
I'll not be there.

2340
02:37:20,806 --> 02:37:22,069
All these years I wasn't happy, dad.

2341
02:37:23,644 --> 02:37:25,010
I was trying to be happy.

2342
02:37:26,281 --> 02:37:27,249
In future too I'll be like that only.

2343
02:37:28,519 --> 02:37:29,611
But I've a request dad.

2344
02:37:30,788 --> 02:37:34,191
Please don't give that I don't
like and expect me to be happy.

2345
02:37:51,587 --> 02:37:54,786
Father...what happened?
- Dear hubby.

2346
02:37:56,962 --> 02:37:59,193
I was happy thinking
that you all were happy.

2347
02:38:01,603 --> 02:38:03,902
I neverthought I was robbing
your happiness to be happy.

2348
02:38:05,275 --> 02:38:06,139
I don't know.

2349
02:38:08,714 --> 02:38:09,442
I really don't know.

2350
02:38:10,584 --> 02:38:14,522
Getting a 10 million profit in business
wasn't a big deal for me,

2351
02:38:14,723 --> 02:38:18,024
but I told everyone with pride
about buying a good shirt foryou.

2352
02:38:20,732 --> 02:38:25,138
But I neverthought I was hurting
you to enjoy that happiness.

2353
02:38:28,912 --> 02:38:29,776
Sorry son.

2354
02:38:32,016 --> 02:38:37,047
Couldn't you've told this to me?

2355
02:38:40,262 --> 02:38:42,891
Why did you hide so much of
sadness for so long?

2356
02:38:43,468 --> 02:38:44,230
Why didn't you tell me?

2357
02:38:46,071 --> 02:38:47,164
Forthis only.

2358
02:38:48,241 --> 02:38:49,800
I know you'll be sad on hearing this.

2359
02:38:51,313 --> 02:38:53,748
You can tell a father who never
cares about his children.

2360
02:38:54,885 --> 02:38:56,183
You're a great father,

2361
02:38:56,988 --> 02:38:58,957
thinking about us only,

2362
02:38:59,426 --> 02:39:00,723
guiding us through life
holding our hands,

2363
02:39:01,763 --> 02:39:02,752
your happiness was in it.

2364
02:39:04,233 --> 02:39:06,464
I wanted to give that happiness
all your life, dad.

2365
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:10,102
I can't give you up at any cost.

2366
02:39:11,778 --> 02:39:16,946
I tried very hard to free myself from
your hold without your knowledge.

2367
02:39:19,457 --> 02:39:21,892
Dad, you're still holding my hand.

2368
02:39:53,709 --> 02:39:54,176
Sorry son.

2369
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:57,104
You faced all this because of me.

2370
02:39:59,184 --> 02:39:59,879
I'll solve this myself.

2371
02:40:01,255 --> 02:40:02,951
Let's stop this marriage at any cost.

2372
02:40:05,394 --> 02:40:06,452
You be happy with your life.

2373
02:40:07,030 --> 02:40:09,431
Father.
- Go son, I'll take care of everything.

2374
02:40:14,142 --> 02:40:15,838
Apply turmeric to the
wedding invitations.

2375
02:40:18,114 --> 02:40:20,583
Welcome, you've come first time
afterthe engagement,

2376
02:40:20,785 --> 02:40:23,221
I'm very happy.
Look, who is here? Get a coffee.

2377
02:40:23,422 --> 02:40:23,945
Okay.
- Please sit.

2378
02:40:26,226 --> 02:40:27,125
Is everyone fine at home?

2379
02:40:43,086 --> 02:40:45,112
Have you come to talk to her?
You carry on.

2380
02:40:45,557 --> 02:40:46,489
I've come to talk to you.

2381
02:40:47,326 --> 02:40:47,792
Go ahead.

2382
02:40:48,294 --> 02:40:51,788
Uncle, let's cancel this marriage.

2383
02:40:54,737 --> 02:40:55,203
Thanks dear.

2384
02:40:57,107 --> 02:40:59,441
Surprised to see me say
thanks instead of sorry.

2385
02:41:03,017 --> 02:41:04,279
If you hadn't come to our home,

2386
02:41:05,855 --> 02:41:07,153
I wouldn't have come to
know my son so well.

2387
02:41:09,794 --> 02:41:11,160
If you hadn't walked out of home,

2388
02:41:12,799 --> 02:41:14,028
I wouldn't have realised my true self.

2389
02:41:14,935 --> 02:41:17,735
He told me what he has lost in
these 24 years because of me.

2390
02:41:20,010 --> 02:41:23,175
I can't give him back everything,
except you.

2391
02:41:25,051 --> 02:41:29,183
If I give you to him, its like giving him
back the 24 years of lost life.

2392
02:41:31,194 --> 02:41:35,462
As a fatherthis is the
only chance I've to win.

2393
02:41:37,771 --> 02:41:38,499
Will you help me to win?

2394
02:41:41,009 --> 02:41:42,034
I'll not accept any of
your explanation,

2395
02:41:42,344 --> 02:41:43,539
you're young and inexperienced,

2396
02:41:43,813 --> 02:41:44,838
he's old, what happened
to his wisdom?

2397
02:41:45,049 --> 02:41:47,382
Don't abuse him, it was my mistake.

2398
02:41:47,920 --> 02:41:50,322
That's why I'm here,
please listen to me.

2399
02:41:50,557 --> 02:41:51,148
What will you say?

2400
02:41:51,525 --> 02:41:53,585
I'll cut yourthroat, it will be painful,
please bear it, isn't it?

2401
02:41:54,230 --> 02:41:57,291
Look son, a marriage cancellation
will not affect a man's life,

2402
02:41:57,869 --> 02:42:01,136
how much painful it will be for
a woman to cancel a marriage?

2403
02:42:02,475 --> 02:42:02,942
You can't judge it.

2404
02:42:03,277 --> 02:42:05,940
Uncle, you're thinking
about engagement,

2405
02:42:07,517 --> 02:42:09,486
I'm talking about life after marriage,

2406
02:42:11,289 --> 02:42:13,190
life is more important
than engagement, uncle.

2407
02:42:17,165 --> 02:42:18,758
I'm not suitable for Subbalakshmi.

2408
02:42:22,173 --> 02:42:26,236
I tried very much to tell about me
and know about you.

2409
02:42:27,381 --> 02:42:30,978
When I saw you spoke
every word added with father,

2410
02:42:31,687 --> 02:42:33,451
I thought you were also
brought up like me only.

2411
02:42:34,559 --> 02:42:36,755
I felt we'll not be happy
with this marriage.

2412
02:42:38,398 --> 02:42:41,961
I should've told this then,
I'm sorry forthe delay.

2413
02:42:44,307 --> 02:42:45,570
I am really sorry.

2414
02:42:48,013 --> 02:42:50,540
You said okay to this marriage
after hearing yourfather,

2415
02:42:51,752 --> 02:42:55,485
I'm telling you today about myself,
will you say okay?

2416
02:42:55,692 --> 02:42:57,854
What can she say?
She's just a little girl.

2417
02:42:58,662 --> 02:42:59,288
I'll tell father.

2418
02:43:00,165 --> 02:43:04,160
My father got angry for
committing one mistake,

2419
02:43:05,306 --> 02:43:10,872
I've promised him to do as he says.

2420
02:43:11,649 --> 02:43:14,176
Father, till now I did what
you had asked me,

2421
02:43:14,387 --> 02:43:16,219
for once please allow me to say,

2422
02:43:17,726 --> 02:43:22,188
he says he'll not be happy
in this marriage,

2423
02:43:23,535 --> 02:43:24,399
why do you still insist?

2424
02:43:25,704 --> 02:43:26,170
cancel it father,

2425
02:43:27,340 --> 02:43:28,034
I don't want this marriage.

2426
02:43:29,777 --> 02:43:31,906
Won't I get married if he rejects me?

2427
02:43:32,782 --> 02:43:33,772
What do I lack?

2428
02:43:34,118 --> 02:43:35,380
No dear...
- Please father.

2429
02:43:36,188 --> 02:43:36,916
Don't say anything.

2430
02:43:37,723 --> 02:43:39,988
Even if you manage to make him accept,
I'll not marry him.

2431
02:43:43,933 --> 02:43:46,768
Thanks Siddhu for coming out
with this before our marriage.

2432
02:43:53,347 --> 02:43:54,645
I'll talk to yourfather,

2433
02:43:55,685 --> 02:43:57,175
his anger is justified,

2434
02:43:58,288 --> 02:44:00,723
I too got angry when Siddhu
proposed to bring you there,

2435
02:44:01,627 --> 02:44:04,028
I asked should I've to stand on
road to know about you?

2436
02:44:04,832 --> 02:44:05,992
But it has come true.

2437
02:44:07,202 --> 02:44:10,036
My entire family is standing
on the road.

2438
02:44:10,274 --> 02:44:12,505
Foryour sake.
Look there!

2439
02:44:53,640 --> 02:44:56,338
Everything went fine, isn't it?
Why are you still abusing?

2440
02:44:56,979 --> 02:44:59,176
Fine?
The real story started just now.

2441
02:44:59,750 --> 02:45:00,808
These fathers are...

2442
02:45:12,870 --> 02:45:14,998
Fortaking my daughter
to your home for 7 days.

2443
02:45:15,407 --> 02:45:18,970
I felt like chopping your
entire family into pieces.

2444
02:45:19,881 --> 02:45:24,286
But when I see the same family standing
at my doors for my daughter,

2445
02:45:24,990 --> 02:45:25,979
I'm very happy.

2446
02:45:27,193 --> 02:45:29,185
I'm very proud of the
way I brought her up.

2447
02:45:29,730 --> 02:45:32,064
But still I refuse to give my daughter's
hand in marriage to your son.

2448
02:45:32,268 --> 02:45:35,762
I too brought up my son very well.
- Did you really?

2449
02:45:36,674 --> 02:45:38,700
Do you know what your son
says after getting drunk?

2450
02:45:45,254 --> 02:45:45,879
Getting drunk?

2451
02:45:46,188 --> 02:45:47,622
Father...I mean you.

2452
02:45:48,058 --> 02:45:49,048
He abuses wildly.

2453
02:45:53,533 --> 02:45:55,662
Okay, my son is using bad words for me.

2454
02:45:56,538 --> 02:45:57,767
I committed mistake, he abused me.

2455
02:45:57,974 --> 02:45:58,963
Will that make him a bad man?

2456
02:45:59,610 --> 02:46:01,545
As a son when he can't
respect his own father,

2457
02:46:02,147 --> 02:46:04,709
how can he respect his wife
as her husband?

2458
02:46:04,918 --> 02:46:07,080
He will...l'm confident.

2459
02:46:08,223 --> 02:46:11,125
If you want I'll send him
to your house for 7 days,

2460
02:46:11,628 --> 02:46:12,857
if you still say no, I'll accept.

2461
02:46:19,874 --> 02:46:22,173
Are you stuck there?
Is that the girl's house?

2462
02:46:22,678 --> 02:46:25,615
Whatever it is yourfather
did the right thing.

2463
02:46:25,950 --> 02:46:27,350
You proved yourself to be a good son,

2464
02:46:27,553 --> 02:46:29,044
prove yourself to be a good lovertoo.

2465
02:46:29,422 --> 02:46:30,754
Okay Siddhu..
