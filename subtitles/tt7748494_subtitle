2
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,460
Tell me.
- Your order sir.

3
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,150
Just a second.

4
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,360
Kids' chorus tomorrow?

5
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,530
Sure!

6
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,010
Gauri, the pizza's here.
- Yeah?

7
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,330
Only two pieces for me.

8
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,160
Why?
Yeah, go on.

9
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,390
What?
You'll be late??

10
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,160
How many kids?
- Eight.

11
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,410
Age group?

12
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,450
Between 5 and 8.
- Okay.

13
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,090
See you in the morning. Bye.

14
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,010
Gauri!
- Yeah?

15
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,810
Let's get the beer.
- Okay.

16
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,850
And the left over chicken chilly?
- Sure!

17
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,280
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme...

18
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,090
Gimme the beer!
Gimme the beer!

19
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,330
Aha!

20
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,000
I love this sound...

21
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,030
See? Like this..

22
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,080
Cheers!

23
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,130
Bliss!

24
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,560
This is perfect, huh?

25
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,500
Hey, hey!
Keep it right here.

26
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,780
Why?
- It gets soiled on the foor.

27
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,700
You've already ruined the sofa!

28
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,050
Oh, come on!

29
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,990
Get a new one,
what's the big deal!

30
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,800
Hey! The website you
showed me the other day?

31
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,220
Had some cool designs!

32
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,480
Order one on it.

33
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,040
Sure! And we have
the money, right?

34
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,450
Baby! We have
everything planned.

35
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,730
You know... systematic.

36
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,890
Plan, splurge, indulge!

37
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,610
Who's this?

38
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,290
Gauri...

39
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,610
You still can't recognize
the players, can you?

40
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,930
He's wearing a helmet... how can I?

41
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,450
Dumbo!

42
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,100
Shut up.
- Go on with your drawing.

43
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,420
What drawing! It's designing.

44
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,810
Same thing.

45
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,650
Good shot!

46
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,570
Gautam...
- Huh?

47
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,450
Tell me something.
Is Kalamkari good or Chikan?

48
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,120
Chicken, anyday Gauri!
But...

49
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,520
fish is even better.

50
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,130
And if you cook fish with...

51
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,130
Did I say something stupid?
- Nope.

52
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,170
Then why did you laugh?
- Because Chikan is good.

53
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,990
You bet! But why is that funny?
- Watch the match.

54
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,850
Tell me!
- It's nothing!

55
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,410
Why did you laugh?

56
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,610
Just like that.

57
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,250
No...
- Yes...

58
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,630
Tell me why.
- Because you like chicken.

59
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,920
I love chicken.

60
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,290
More than Kalamkari, right?
- Yeah!

61
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,430
Hey, Gautam...

62
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,490
Sweetie, please get the door...

63
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,890
Please wake up.

64
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,770
Wake up!

65
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,970
Last night I opened the door.
Your turn now.

66
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,490
Oh come on Gautam...
Don't do this!

67
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,570
Why can't you get up early?

68
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,220
Let him go back.
- Get up!

69
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,820
Get up!

70
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,530
What's your problem?

71
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,610
What's this Gautam!
Even the TV is still on!

72
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,650
Happy anniversary!

73
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,110
Thank you!

74
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,290
Thank you...

75
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,710
Yay! Gautu! Gautu,
Happy anniversary!

76
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,200
Help! Help!
- My sweetie pie Gautu...

77
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,950
My dramatic character!

78
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,290
Happy anniversary.

79
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,630
Our love story is
3 years old, Mumbai.

80
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,930
Yes sweetheart Pune.

81
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,470
Wonder how I spent
3 years with a crook like you!

82
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,810
It's the charm...

83
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,220
Shut up.

84
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,520
What time is it?
- Huh?

85
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,690
The time?

86
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,180
Must be around 7:30.
- Check.

87
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,690
I gotta go!

88
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,790
Gauri! Where are my...
Got them! Got my jeans!

89
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,430
Gautam?
What's the plan for the evening?

90
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,470
Talking to me?

91
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,170
See anybody else around?

92
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,720
You've picked up the sarcasm
of Punekars well in 3 years.

93
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,140
I love you Gauri.

94
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,130
And make it fast!

95
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,650
The maid has bailed today?
- Yup! Again.

96
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,320
I'm used to it by now.

97
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,930
Having tea?
- No...

98
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,570
I have acidity.

99
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,410
Why?
- You want tea?

100
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,690
Nah! Not your favourite green tea.

101
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,410
Looks like water in the
puddle after rains.

102
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,730
And tastes like that too.
- Ew!

103
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,110
Silly, that's iced tea.

104
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,730
Same family after all.

105
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,250
Sorry distortions of regular tea.

106
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,140
Nothing beats traditional tea
from local tea shops.

107
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,400
I'm ready.
- Eeks!

108
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,450
You're not going to bathe?!

109
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,290
Did you rinse your mouth?

110
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,170
Hey, hey! Why did you push me?

111
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,720
Let's go!
- My cab's here. Bye!

112
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,930
Hey, Gauri!

113
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,950
Come on, what's the hurry...

114
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,210
Hey, just a minute!
- What?

115
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,810
It's okay, go ahead.
- Okay!

116
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,670
Gauri!
- Yeah?

117
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,270
Seen my keys? Can't find them.

118
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,760
They were on the floor with the clothes.
I've put them on the table.

119
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,850
I love you!

120
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Love you.
- Bye!

121
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,830
Hello!

122
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,950
Hello...

123
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,370
Happy anniversary...

124
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,886
Thank you mom, thank you so much!

125
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,130
Have you left already?
- We've left.

126
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,770
Okay.

127
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,180
Your parcel is here.
What did you order?

128
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,620
Those are Gautam's headphones
and my scarves.

129
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,710
Okay.

130
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,320
I've made pudding for you.

131
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,670
I was about to come over.

132
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,680
Would have put it
in your fridge.

133
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,490
But we're dropping
in tonight anyway.

134
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,730
Yeah, but I'd rather bring it over.

135
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,930
We have a Tom cat in the house.
- Tom cat?!

136
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,290
Of course!

137
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,140
Your fathe-in-law raids the fridge
while I'm napping.

138
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,020
Can't trust him
with the pudding.

139
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,530
Now you know who's Tom cat, right?

140
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,330
Yeah okay... Fine.

141
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,600
See you then?

142
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,810
We'll meet in the evening.
- Yes.

143
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,560
Bye, bye.
- Bye...

144
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,430
You've got some reference designs?
- Mother! Look what I found!

145
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,940
Sweetie, Mamma is busy...
Let her work...

146
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,230
Why don't you play...

147
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,410
Radhika, we had selected
this before, right?

148
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,870
Yes.

149
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,610
In this design, a green
border with orange would -

150
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,930
Anushka!

151
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,650
What are you doing???

152
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,900
Come here. Aren't
you a good girl?

153
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,020
Wait here... okay?
And let us work.

154
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,230
I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!

155
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,650
Actually her grandma does
look after her but...

156
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,940
she has gone to a movie
with her friends...

157
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,960
And the maid hasn't shown up.
I'm so sorry!

158
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,110
Calm down, it's okay...

159
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,830
I know how hard it can be...
It's okay.

160
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,890
Should we sit there to
talk about the fabrics?

161
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,420
Uh.. I think you should carry on.

162
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,330
I'll take her home.
- I think Gauri...

163
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,900
How about we do this
after a few days?

164
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,090
Why?
- But...

165
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,200
No. no... Don't worry...

166
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,800
I know, it's very difficult
to handle children...

167
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,200
We'll meet in a
couple of days... okay?

168
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,210
Sorry!
- Bye.

169
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,050
Radhika, what's this!

170
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,490
Babysitting...

171
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,690
Mom, what is Kalamkari?
Chicken or fish?

172
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,530
Hmm... Over to you.

173
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,090
Kalamkari is a type of fabric.

174
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,650
Just like cotton or silk.

175
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,850
Yeah?
- Yeah.

176
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,200
Sounded like Kalamari
from Goa!...Kalamkari!

177
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,690
Ohh!

178
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,240
That's why Gauri laughed at me!

179
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,040
Let her get here, I'll show her!

180
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,210
Mom, Gauri said there
was a parcel...

181
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,890
It's in the room.

182
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,130
So is the fish happening?
- Here.

183
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,740
See if I've finally got it right!
- Of course you would have!

184
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,876
And don't bother about
cleaning up. I'll do it.

185
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,130
Lucky me!

186
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,740
Whoa!

187
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,360
This fell down.

188
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,246
Did you drop it?
Don't worry, I'll pick it up.

189
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,780
Gautam, pick it up!

190
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,100
How can you litter the place like that?
- Exactly!

191
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,230
Your home is a mess too.
How do you live there!

192
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,510
And so much of online shopping!

193
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,970
What do you order I wonder.
- Hi!

194
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,290
Oh, come on in.
- Mom!

195
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,250
I could smell the aroma
of fish outside. - Welcome...

196
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,290
By the way, what exactly
are you complaining about?

197
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,420
Online shopping?
Or being messy?

198
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,810
Online shopping.

199
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,210
And I cleaned up
their home today!

200
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,290
You cleaned up?
- Yes.

201
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,080
Please don't do that!
- Whoa! What's that?

202
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,370
It's a problem Dad.
When things are right there,

203
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,820
it's easy to find them.

204
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,200
If you tidy them up

205
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,120
you can't find anything
when you need it!

206
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,290
Right!
- Don't act smart Gautam!

207
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,840
How do you manage to
live in that mess!

208
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,820
Mom!

209
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,970
Sangeeta didn't come in today.
Usually she cleans up.

210
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,050
That's okay...
Please take this outside.

211
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,780
Mom...
- Yes?

212
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,170
Come here.
I want to tell you something.

213
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,020
What?
- Didn't you tell them yet?

214
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,210
It was finalized this evening.
- What is it?

215
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,170
So the thing is...

216
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,590
We're going to Kenya.

217
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,380
Huh?
- Wonderful!

218
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,650
You know Pakya?

219
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,890
Prakash Joshi.
- I know him!

220
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,720
He's doing a project
for Discovery channel.

221
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,960
Okay!
- So we go to Kenya,

222
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,810
wander around among the tribals

223
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,290
and catch the different sounds...

224
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,570
their musical instruments...

225
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,210
We bring back the recordings.

226
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,710
Great!
- Isn't that impressive?

227
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,150
Absolutely!
- I'll be working...

228
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,880
She's coming for the balloon safari.
- Good for her!

229
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,080
Have a good time.

230
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,930
But... the ticket must be expensive...
- Kind of...

231
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,920
Hope you're saving money...

232
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,290
Yes mommy! Don't worry.

233
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,270
We are sorted Mom.

234
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,360
Your son is not just capable...

235
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,090
He is also wise...
- Have beer.

236
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,440
In fact you should both join us.

237
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,260
Nah! Lot of work to do.

238
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,400
Just remember to do me a favour.

239
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,950
Get me a few spears
on your way back.

240
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,970
When your Mom makes piercing
comments I will pierce back!

241
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,120
I make piercing comments?
- Just kidding darling!

242
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,450
Your tongue is naturally sharp.

243
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,850
Let's set the table.

244
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,690
Mom...
- Huh?

245
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,820
Actually I'll just have
curd and rice. Acidity you see...

246
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,650
Obviously... with pizza
and cuppa noodles everyday...

247
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,410
My stomach is bad too...

248
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,530
You should have curd rice too.
- Come on, Mom!

249
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,010
Who eats curd-rice
when there's fish!

250
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,470
I don't mind eating
fish and going

251
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,150
to the potty a few times more!

252
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,040
It's Sunday tomorrow! Get up late,
crap and then... cricket!

253
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,980
I'll say don't eat fish.

254
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,960
Why?
- You want to play cricket, right?

255
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,280
If I don't, you don't either.
- What nonsense!

256
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,050
I want fish... pass me some.

257
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,010
Hi...

258
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,720
Kaku Gautam kaka doesn't listen!

259
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,730
He doesn't let us bat.

260
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,630
He is out.

261
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,460
Isn't he?
- The second time!

262
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,690
And if we tell him that,
he calls us crooks!

263
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,810
What?
- Crooks!

264
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,770
Gautam!

265
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,940
Hey crybaby!

266
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,650
One minute... One minute!

267
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,420
Yeah?

268
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,740
What's going on?
You're cheating?

269
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,740
Hey Nikya? What are
you doing up there?

270
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,200
She's my wife, not mom,
to complain to!

271
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,200
Come back!

272
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,450
Hope you know you are
much older than them!

273
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,990
You're screwing up
the logic Gauri.

274
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,030
You see... this is not about age.

275
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,280
It's a matter of principle.

276
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,830
When Maratha ruler
Peshwa was my age...

277
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,890
Give them the bat.
Take his bat away.

278
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,440
Okay, listen. I'm going
to Shubhu mavshi's.

279
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,610
Do you need medicine
for your tummy?

280
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,000
The fish has worked.

281
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,550
Come back soon. Till then
I'll give them good.

282
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,250
Nikya, come down.

283
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,050
Watch me strip that cap
off your little head! Get here now!

284
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,780
Come on, don't stand yapping away.

285
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,290
Lovely Saaree!

286
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,650
Ritu is very happy
with your work.

287
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,370
And back there in the U.S.

288
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,120
her clients are happy too.

289
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,490
I have a smart daughter in law.

290
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,170
Lives there and runs
a boutique of Indian Saarees.

291
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,880
Mavshi, come home.
It's been ages.

292
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,970
I want to.

293
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,700
Suhas will be back
from Narmada tour.

294
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,250
Yeah... hats off to her.

295
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,730
So much energy at this age...

296
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,130
Tea?
- No, thanks... I must leave.

297
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,940
I have acidity.

298
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,590
My periods are also
irregular again.

299
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,620
But my treatment had
worked, hadn't it?

300
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,450
Actually yes... but...
maybe work stress...

301
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,650
Have you conceived?

302
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,550
I mean it may not have
occurred to you...

303
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,250
No no no no! Not at all.
Not possible.

304
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,850
Why?
- I mean it's like...

305
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,650
what Gautam says...

306
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,090
Well planned...
We take care...

307
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,250
Listen to me Gauri...

308
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,970
Take a pregnancy test.

309
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,900
You never know!

310
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,750
One minute!

311
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,420
I'm not out. My
stomach is grumbling.

312
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,650
A lot!

313
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,350
So, a toilet break now.
You all go and pee.

314
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,510
After the break,
you bowl, I bat.

315
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,480
Hi! I'm AB.

316
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,800
No, not Amitabh Bachchan.

317
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,240
Gautam and Gauri's accidental baby.
So AB.

318
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,000
In the coming few weeks, I'm
going to chat with you.

319
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,970
And express my opinion.

320
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,530
After all I'm a Punekar. Must
opine even in the womb.

321
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,200
Come out quickly, please!

322
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,390
Coming...

323
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,000
Gauri, I need to crap
urgently, please come out.

324
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,890
Gauri!

325
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,310
Should I run across to Mom's?

326
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,370
Move!

327
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,810
What's going on?

328
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,750
Better watch your tummy.

329
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,990
Or we'll start looking the
same in a few months!

330
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,460
What do you mean?

331
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,390
After all the precautions...

332
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,170
Why're you laughing?

333
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,110
Dumbo!

334
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,980
Gauri!

335
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,170
Gauri...

336
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,650
Don't you mess with me.
Gauri, don't laugh!

337
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,850
Are you serious? Huh?

338
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,890
Nonsense...

339
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,090
Huh?

340
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,950
No, no, no, no, no!

341
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,720
The two are laughing at their
own blunder in such a way...

342
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,820
that it's hard to tell if
they're happy or shocked!

343
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,570
Hey Gauri...

344
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,010
Dumbo...

345
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,810
I can imagine what must be
happening to you.

346
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,410
My tummy feels the
same since morning.

347
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,850
What?

348
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,090
Help! Help!

349
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,890
Will be back.

350
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,090
And don't tell Mom already.

351
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,130
You have a call.

352
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,200
Hello?

353
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,290
What!

354
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,050
Really?

355
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,580
Neeraja was here and

356
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,370
we all went to Sinhgad..

357
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
That night?

358
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,570
Ahh!

359
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,650
We finished the drum practice

360
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,320
had Anna's Misal, and
drank beer...

361
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,690
That was the night!

362
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,450
Gauri... I'm sure it must
have been that night.

363
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,440
Forget it... It has happened now.

364
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,650
That's not done!

365
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,690
We must know when we goofed up!

366
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,570
Okay listen Gauri..

367
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,850
Don't tell anybody
just yet please!

368
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:58,010
Don't breathe a word Gauri.
You get it?

369
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,020
Listen...

370
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,890
Two lines is definitely positive?

371
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,700
Yes.

372
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,740
I'm done for.

373
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,190
Oh, really?

374
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,550
Congratulations!
Heartiest congratulations!

375
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,110
I did suspect...

376
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,230
She hadn't been eating
much last few days.

377
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,720
Is it?...uh...

378
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,090
You know what...

379
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,850
I'll start knitting a
sweater right away.

380
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,080
Tiny socks, bonnet...

381
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,310
I'll make a list of groceries...

382
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:08,440
Must order all the herbs
and condiments...

383
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,730
And we must make a
list of names...

384
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,160
It'll be a flurry later.

385
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,960
What's the name calling about?
- You're right.

386
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:19,420
And yes! Are there
anyGarbhasanskar classes nearby?

387
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,460
Yes, there are!

388
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,800
You know, Aai will be
back from Narmada tour...

389
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,520
Why don't you come over a
couple of days earlier?

390
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,680
Gauri would be thrilled.
- Hey...

391
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,710
One minute...

392
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,060
Really... Leave for
Pune right away!

393
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,980
Who are you inviting?

394
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,430
Let me talk to Gauri's father.

395
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,140
Okay... See you then?

396
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,090
We'll speak later...

397
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,690
Just a minute...

398
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,680
Please ask Gauri not to
post on social media yet...

399
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,770
It's a norm not to announce it

400
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,620
until the first
trimester is over...

401
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,310
I'll tell her not to say anything...
- Yeah...

402
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:55,950
Okay bye...

403
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,100
So now, may I know what
this is all about?

404
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,810
There's good news in the family!

405
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,910
What?!!

406
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,760
Not me!
- Ahh...

407
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,510
Hi!
- Hi!

408
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,440
Singing session!
- Yeah!

409
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,446
Hey! Where are you going?
- Be right there.

410
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,590
Come on.

411
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,140
Sit here.
- Come.

412
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,290
Mom!

413
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,200
Dad... the first one...
- Oh okay...

414
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,630
No, no...

415
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,640
Dad listen! This is great, but...

416
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,460
sing that one...
Kishor Da's... your favourite.

417
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,710
Ohh...

418
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,470
Okay...

419
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,550
Yeah...

420
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,880
What's this Dad?

421
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,970
Hey Kids' Channel!
What's going on?

422
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,120
A little birdie has
already told us...

423
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,900
What?

424
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,880
Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you, soooo much!

425
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,950
For making us grandparents!

426
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,710
Mom, actually...

427
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,110
Congratulations!

428
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,910
I've been there too!

429
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,080
So what if you didn't say it.
We know it!

430
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,110
And...

431
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,830
Why don't you want this child?

432
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,320
Listen... Mavshi...

433
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,860
We want a baby...

434
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,970
But not by accident.

435
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,190
I mean... We want
a planned child.

436
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,670
We always plan everything.

437
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,230
So... We aren't ready yet.

438
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,320
And at this stage, we can't

439
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,710
spare time from work.
- Yes.

440
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,350
Work goes on anyway...

441
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,950
As for sparing time...

442
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,020
both of you have
your parents to help you.

443
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,020
There is Suhas too.
She's still fit enough.

444
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,110
Yeah...

445
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,630
Grandparents are blessings.

446
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,090
Later -
- Mavshi! Later, we'll see...

447
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,280
But right now our space,
our comfort...

448
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,310
is what we can't sacrifice.

449
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,740
I mean we're really
not ready Mavshi.

450
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,470
Plus...
She has a very bright future.

451
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,070
And I have some
financial goals too.

452
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,070
These things will still happen.

453
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,240
You shouldn't delay the baby.

454
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,790
Finally, it's your call.

455
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,910
Gauri... These are the tablets.

456
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,470
I'll prescribe another one too.

457
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,980
These will be...

458
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,120
one in the morning...

459
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,870
and one at bedtime.

460
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,830
Three days.

461
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,790
You'll be free.

462
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,900
But...

463
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,630
before you go for it...
let your parents know.

464
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,070
Yes Mavshi...
Of course.

465
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,730
I think Mom and Dad
will understand.

466
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,270
They'll see our point.

467
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,910
Dad will.

468
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,590
Mom will be a little...

469
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,950
But we'll explain.

470
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,090
Luckily enough we
have to deal only

471
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,620
with my parents as of now.
- Yeah.

472
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,950
Where is Mom?
- In the room.

473
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,270
They're here!

474
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,090
They don't know, do they?
- Not at all!

475
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,470
That's Mom for you!
- Gauri!

476
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:13,990
Coming!

477
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,310
These two have decided
to 'Delete me for all'!

478
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:31,660
Trust them to sit atop Sinhagad
fort and take such drastic decisions!

479
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,430
But my decision is final too.
I will be born.

480
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,750
I have the grit of a Mumbaikar!

481
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,270
Just watch!

482
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,310
Penny for your thought!

483
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,870
Want to know?

484
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,870
You won't laugh?

485
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,950
Gautam!

486
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,020
Can't help it!
That's the way I am.

487
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,510
Okay, I won't laugh.

488
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,230
It's Sungchi.

489
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,960
What?!!
- Yeah!

490
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,550
Man, oh man!

491
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,470
Can't believe this!

492
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,190
You're thinking of Sungchi?!

493
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,830
You still remember?
- Of course!

494
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,390
You had spoken so
tenderly about her.

495
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,190
Dumbo!

496
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,200
Listen!

497
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,750
She must have a few
kids by now, right?

498
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,830
With weird eyebrows...

499
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,510
This is where you had
read out your poem...

500
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,710
Ahh...

501
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,710
Come here baby...

502
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,640
Bliss!

503
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,030
Ajji, how are you?

504
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,670
Great! How about you?
- I'm fine.

505
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,260
Sangeeta!

506
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,570
Please get me a
glass of cold water.

507
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,710
Yes...

508
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,230
God...

509
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,110
The heat is unbearable.

510
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,120
Pune is getting
just as bad as Mumbai.

511
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,640
Yeah.
- It's a furnace.

512
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,910
Put some water in it please.
- Yes.

513
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,190
And...

514
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,110
What's all this!

515
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,790
What a mess!

516
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,980
Don't you ever
tidy up the place?

517
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,910
They've warned me not
to touch anything.

518
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,550
Why bother then.
- Oh...

519
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,430
Get me the water...

520
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,780
These are Moong Laddoos.

521
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,700
Give one to Gauri every day.
- Yes.

522
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:14,940
Got it?
- Yes.

523
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,310
Another thing...

524
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,030
I'm keeping this book in Gauri's room.
- Yes.

525
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,710
Tell her I've kept it for her.
- Yes.

526
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,630
You are turning into
a true Punekar.

527
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,990
No!
- Hey...

528
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,380
Every Punekar has a burning
pride for their history!

529
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,070
You're getting there.
- Not pride.

530
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,570
This is pride.
- No!

531
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,530
It is!
- It isn't! I like it here.

532
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,760
And we have wonderful
memories here!

533
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,670
You can hear the
inner voice here.

534
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,316
This is where I'd
said that to you.

535
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,930
You called me a liar!

536
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,550
Gautam listen...

537
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,010
See, we don't want a baby.

538
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
We're sure.

539
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,660
But our parents are
already thinking ahead.

540
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,700
We must tell them soon.

541
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,130
Ajji!

542
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,740
Ajji hi!

543
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,510
What? You've reached?

544
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,980
She's back?
- We're together.

545
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:38,100
Right away... We'll be there!

546
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,500
Grandma's back!

547
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,630
How come she came earlier?
- She was expected, but I thought...

548
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,690
Luckily the call got through.
- Yeah...

549
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,760
Listen...
- Huh?

550
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,910
Don't tell them we
were on Sinhgad.

551
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,110
Why? You think
I'd worry about that?

552
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,380
I had brought you here
before the wedding!

553
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,600
Are you mad?

554
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,100
Just keep shut.

555
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,620
Okay, I'll keep shut.

556
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,950
But I should know why.

557
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
Gauri!

558
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,670
Gauri?

559
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,890
What is it?
- Was about to fall.

560
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,980
I did nothing!

561
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,440
You're walking too fast.

562
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,270
I agree...

563
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,680
You are young folks with
an independant thinking.

564
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:49,290
But does that mean you
don't talk to us?

565
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,470
Have we become strangers to you?

566
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,030
Aai... I haven't
taken the pill yet.

567
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,910
But...

568
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,830
You were about to though.

569
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,020
Mom...

570
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,910
It's not how you think it is.

571
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,230
Ajji...

572
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,770
It's not that we
don't want a baby.

573
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,020
We don't want itnow, because...

574
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,710
we're not ready yet.

575
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,870
In a couple of years we
will go for it. Definitely.

576
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,950
I mean...

577
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,700
Mavshi, we did speak
about this...

578
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,440
Yes... yes.

579
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,230
Actually Suhas called me,
so I came over.

580
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,780
But about late pregnancy...

581
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,080
it's effects... and chances...

582
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,630
I did tell you about all that.

583
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,830
I hope you're not
worried about us!

584
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:01,110
We're fit enough to babysit.
- Of course!

585
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,380
And it's the first time. So
we'll manage everything.

586
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,530
Where's the problem?
- No Mom...

587
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,750
It's not about who will manage.

588
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,950
She's just saying
it's tradition.

589
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,590
Yes, but that is not the point.

590
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,910
Whether it's
her parents or mine...

591
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:22,490
Or how many people can help
once the baby arrives...

592
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,990
is not the question.

593
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,920
We know you all are with us.

594
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,170
Point is Dad,

595
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,000
we aren't financially
settled yet.

596
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,110
About career...
- Yes!

597
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,750
Our careers too.

598
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,800
Mine and hers too.

599
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:47,070
She too has great prospects.
- But...

600
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,640
So... we felt we would...

601
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,910
achieve our individual
financial targets...

602
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:56,010
What nonsense, financial targets!

603
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,670
You think the baby will demand
money the minute it's born?

604
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,230
The first few years babies
hardly need anything.

605
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,680
Lots of love and a
little food, that's it.

606
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,070
It'll be very happy.

607
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,230
Babies demand nothing.

608
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:15,430
But give you a whole lot.

609
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,830
And here you are,
refusing just that!

610
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,750
What a generation this is!

611
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:28,390
I don't like this at all.
Take it from me.

612
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,570
Yes... That's okay...

613
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,230
What? How is it okay?

614
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,500
After all it's their decision...

615
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:40,070
They have to see it through.
- Really!

616
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,070
How can you say that?

617
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,220
It's about our children..
And then their children.

618
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,190
Do we have no say
in their lives?

619
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:55,360
I suggest we think about
this with a cool head.

620
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,770
Why don't you see if there's
ice cream in the fridge?

621
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,710
Is this the time for ice cream?
- Mother...

622
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,430
Let's calm down a bit.

623
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:10,590
Please... would you
check in the fridge?

624
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,630
Mom...

625
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,020
Need help?

626
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,130
Here.

627
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:50,390
I'll take this. Would you
please bring this?

628
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,110
Aai...

629
00:44:58,930 --> 00:44:59,930
Aai...

630
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,330
Hey...

631
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,700
Bye...

632
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,600
Hi... Good morning.
- Hi...

633
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,330
Hey... all okay?
- Totally!

634
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,440
Hi! Beer?

635
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,240
No?

636
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,480
What's up?
No beer... All okay?

637
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,920
Gauri...

638
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,720
Is it the side effects
of the pills?

639
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,370
Haven't taken them yet.

640
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,520
Last two days, I've
been thinking.

641
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,450
I did the same thing
before the wedding.

642
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,430
Kept everybody on tenterhooks
with my indecision.

643
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,330
I don't want that again.

644
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,000
We take our family for granted.

645
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:02,180
Even this time we thought
they would protest.

646
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,360
But they accepted our decision.

647
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,910
They were all so happy...

648
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,660
And we were convincing them

649
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,480
we would think about
it after 3 years!

650
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,190
Gauri we were not
convincing them.

651
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,520
We were actually going to do so.

652
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,990
As of now, we aren't ready.

653
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,920
Who knows about the future!

654
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,180
What if I don't conceive then?

655
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,840
We've crossed 30!

656
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,310
Are we going to
stay young forever?

657
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,120
Gauri, we are not ready.

658
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,480
Are you getting it?

659
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,550
I don't know about you, but...

660
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,710
subconsciously I have already

661
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,480
begun to accept this baby.

662
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,710
The other day when I
was about to fall...

663
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,390
you know the first
thing that happened?

664
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,610
My hand went to my tummy.

665
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,350
I thought of protecting
the baby before me!

666
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,320
Where did this
feeling come from?

667
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:56,490
And...

668
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:58,290
See...

669
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,670
abortion means...

670
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,176
in a way we are killing someone.

671
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,200
I don't think we should do that.

672
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,030
What do you think?

673
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,160
I think we're going in circles.

674
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,590
I've told you we're not ready.

675
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,000
Now I'm not sure about you...

676
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,240
You're confused...
But I'm not ready.

677
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,720
What more can I say!

678
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,800
Do as you please.

679
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:52,860
You are my favourite!

680
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,100
Mom?
- Good morning!

681
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:00,230
Here he is!

682
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,960
His Highness is here.

683
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,910
Get the sweets.

684
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,840
Congratulations!
- Thank you.

685
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,230
What about?

686
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,460
Congratulations Gautam!

687
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,760
You made the right decision.

688
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:15,910
Gauri called us early
in the morning.

689
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:19,390
Congratulations!
- It really felt good.

690
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,680
I knew you'd change your mind.

691
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,780
Yeah...

692
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:41,360
We spoke at length last night...

693
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,360
You guys are so amazing.

694
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,070
Always there for us.

695
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:50,960
And Ajji...

696
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,680
We would have a baby some day...

697
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,510
Doesn't matter,
now or later... Right?

698
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,240
I'll get it.

699
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:08,320
Hello? Shubhu?

700
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,960
The kids have agreed.

701
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,240
You went there?

702
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:16,360
We're at Gautam's.
Hop across.

703
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,710
Yes, come over.

704
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,330
It was Shubhu.

705
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,360
One minute...
- What?

706
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,180
I want to clarify
something right now...

707
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:30,240
What now?
- We're taking this chance...

708
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:32,890
But it's the only one! Ajji...

709
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,710
Don't talk us into
getting a sibling...

710
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,400
that they'll grow up
together... huh?

711
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,230
Mom -
- We'll see about that later.

712
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,710
Dad, wait!

713
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,100
Our decision is made.

714
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:46,630
Mom, calm him down, please!

715
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,240
Gauri?

716
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:50,800
Okay?

717
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,240
I need tea!

718
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,530
Go ahead.

719
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:59,440
Hey Sangeeta,
please give me tea.

720
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,250
Sangeeta... Check the machine first.
- Yes Tai.

721
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:26,480
We never spoke...

722
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:30,670
But we did say...
that we're a team.

723
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:34,240
We play the innings together.

724
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,320
I didn't tell you
last night Gauri...

725
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,240
But if I don't now,
it'll be too late.

726
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,200
What?

727
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,920
I'm very happy you
took this decision.

728
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,400
I'm very happy.

729
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:08,600
But Gauri it's not going
to be easy for you...

730
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,400
You have to make a lot
more sacrifices than me.

731
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:15,440
Not just for nine months.

732
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,240
It's a long process. Lifelong...

733
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:23,430
We lived for ourselves
all these years.

734
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,260
Suddenly we have to
start living for somebody else.

735
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:27,990
Forever.

736
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,360
Come on in...

737
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:35,530
It's tough for me,
but tougher for you.

738
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:39,490
A lot will change...
Your whole life.

739
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:43,330
I'll always be there of course.

740
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:48,520
But truth remains that
I'm not mentally prepared.

741
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:51,960
But I'm there.

742
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,360
You've thought this
through, right?

743
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,920
Don't scare me...

744
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,600
Hey...

745
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,610
Gautam,... Gauri...

746
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,860
Shubhu Mavshi wants to talk to you.
- Coming.

747
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,400
Congratulations!

748
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,280
You are all very happy...

749
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,400
But Gauri's latest
reports are here.

750
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,600
Let's talk about those... and...

751
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:57,840
you could ask me if
you have queries.

752
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,540
Shubhu Mavshi, is
there a problem?

753
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:07,070
Well... I have Gauri's
ultra sound reports.

754
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:11,520
Just a minute...

755
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,290
It's only five minutes back that

756
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,160
I've geared up for this.

757
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:20,790
Mavshi, if there's a
complication, tell us now.

758
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:23,130
I'm sure it's not too late.

759
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,120
All we can do now...

760
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:32,480
is to face what
we have before us.

761
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:55,960
A second baby has been detected.

762
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:01,390
We have twins!

763
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,430
What are you saying!

764
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:15,880
Hey, come on... this is
where you enter the show!

765
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:27,070
What news!

766
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,720
Thank you, thank you so much!

767
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:33,820
My sweetheart! You're
going to have twins!

768
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,800
What's that saying?

769
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,020
When God gives...

770
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:39,040
it bursts in through the roof!

771
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,990
♫ When God showers his graces ♫

772
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:47,230
♪ It bursts in through the roof ♫

773
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:54,650
♪ It's nothing to
do with your will. ♫

774
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,960
♪ All we must do is take it all ♫

775
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:03,080
♪ with welcoming hands. ♫

776
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,430
♪ Tell me... ♫

777
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:12,020
♪ What is happiness after all... ♫

778
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:16,830
Being a father doesn't start
when the child is born.

779
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:19,510
It starts when the
mother is pregnant.

780
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:21,680
Wow...
- Gautam...

781
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,080
Calm down.

782
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,990
I am calm! Why?

783
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:28,440
Pregnancy - 1st trimester.

784
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,270
Hi...

785
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,480
First time?

786
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,900
It's their first time too!

787
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:35,020
Same here.

788
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,790
Yes Aai?
What's up?

789
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:39,790
Called just like that.

790
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:41,910
I'm making laddoos.

791
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:43,310
Laddoos?
- Yes!

792
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,470
What's the hurry?

793
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,510
Hey, I want them!

794
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:49,930
Hello, Aai?
Which laddoos?

795
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,110
Rawa-besan!

796
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:52,760
Gauri loves them.

797
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:54,190
Awesome!

798
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:57,150
Make them a little soft. Or
they stick in the teeth.

799
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,100
Yes, okay...

800
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:00,780
Send it by taxi courier.
- I will.

801
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,180
Listen, we are at the clinic.

802
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,260
I'll call you later.
- Oh, is it?

803
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,420
Yeah, I will.

804
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,300
Bye...

805
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:11,950
Gauri, have some water.

806
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,140
No, thanks.

807
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:15,630
It says here you must,
before the sonography.

808
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:17,750
Forget that. Read this.

809
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,390
Wake up at 7 every day?
- That's for you.

810
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:30,990
Think you can do it?

811
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:38,270
Gautam... This is
how it's going to be...

812
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:40,270
Yeah... looks like.

813
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,420
You think we can manage?

814
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:43,830
I'd warned you.

815
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,190
Remember what you said?

816
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,910
Abortion means killing someone.

817
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:50,390
And here we have two of them!

818
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:51,950
Two...

819
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,360
Listen...

820
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:57,390
Will my tummy become
very huge because it's twins?

821
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,180
Will I be able to walk?

822
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,190
And sit comfortably?

823
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:03,890
Say something!

824
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,030
What can I say?

825
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,030
I mean...

826
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,980
Does your tummy bother you

827
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:11,470
when you walk or sit?

828
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:17,970
Are you even really worried?

829
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,766
It's a genuine doubt!
- And I don't have a paunch!

830
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:20,950
Yeah?
- Look.

831
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:24,290
Hey, this is good!

832
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,110
Even I can do that
when my tummy grows.

833
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:27,550
What are you doing!

834
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,300
Did you fall on your
head as a kid?!!

835
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:33,230
Gauri Pradhan!
- Yes.

836
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,440
Come with me!

837
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,110
Hello.

838
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,390
Stop running from now on.

839
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:44,070
Sorry.

840
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:46,790
You have twins?

841
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:48,150
Not yet. I'm going to.

842
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:51,110
It's better. Two at one go.

843
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:53,110
Your BP is low.

844
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,370
You got a car?
- Oh yes!

845
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,750
Good. Stop commuting by rickshaw.

846
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,950
What's your diet like?
- My brain for one.

847
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,750
Quit hitting.

848
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,910
And stop biting your nails.

849
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:07,070
Avoid mango and papaya.

850
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:09,380
Just a minute!
Papaya is fine but

851
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:11,260
you get mangoes only
once in a year...

852
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,170
Do babies keep coming
all year round?

853
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:14,510
You're going to be a mother.

854
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,940
It's not good for the baby.

855
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:17,870
Tai, Can I eat mangoes?

856
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:19,710
Eat what you want!

857
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,860
Your job is done.
- Thank you.

858
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,830
Don't eat pizza and stuff!

859
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:26,950
Your report shows
low haemoglobin.

860
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:28,820
Do you eat bitter gourd?
- Eeks!

861
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:29,910
What eeks?

862
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:32,030
Eat bitter gourd... and carrots.

863
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,220
Okay...

864
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,590
Let's check your weight.
Take off your shoes.

865
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:39,750
You're wearing heels?!!

866
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:41,350
Won't do.

867
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:43,190
Wear flat ones.

868
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:44,990
How much?

869
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,500
Just a minute.
- Seventy.

870
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,680
Sixty one.

871
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,310
What other habits?

872
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:50,620
Sleep?

873
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:51,710
Sound.

874
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:54,530
Not that. On your
back or the side?

875
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,780
Oh. On my stomach.

876
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:56,950
Stop doing that.

877
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,190
Sleeping?!

878
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:00,540
Stop sleeping on your stomach.

879
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:02,910
See, your tummy will grow now...

880
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,950
How can you sleep on it?
- Right.

881
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:07,620
How do you manage?

882
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:10,300
Any restrictions on
fighting with the husband?

883
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:12,110
She should avoid
fighting altogether.

884
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:14,140
She could fight with
anybody. Once when...

885
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:15,990
Keep your mind calm and happy.

886
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:19,330
Keep this file. The medicines
are written in there.

887
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,230
Don't forget to take
them regularly.

888
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:22,730
One more thing.

889
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:25,070
Don't keep the seat
belt too tight.

890
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:26,890
That's all?
- That's all.

891
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:30,460
Tai... I'd like to

892
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:32,900
discuss this subject
with you sometime.

893
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,160
Sign here.

894
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,160
Hey!

895
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:48,520
Don't fasten the
seat belt too tight!

896
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:54,180
Home?

897
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,590
Ummm... No.
- Then?

898
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:04,950
Slow! Climb down slowly!

899
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,190
You still find it funny, huh?
- Yeah.

900
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,370
Damn... I feel as
if my life is over!

901
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:15,710
No mangoes?!! Come on!

902
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:17,140
I'd told you.

903
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:18,350
You wanted it.

904
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:20,860
You mean you don't?
- I didn't say that.

905
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:22,310
Yes you did!

906
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:25,710
One minute! Let's clear
exactly what you want to say.

907
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,750
What's there to clear?
One minute!

908
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:30,190
I've already told you.

909
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:33,910
I'm nervous, I'm scared.
And as of now, I'm not ready.

910
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:35,630
Gauri!

911
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,220
Tell me honestly Gauri...

912
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:40,310
You sure you can do this?

913
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,480
What? Childbirth?

914
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:45,390
No! Eating bitter gourd and
carrots next nine months!

915
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:48,420
Can you do it?

916
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:51,910
Look at you!

917
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:05,730
Thank you!

918
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,670
Hey, how can you peek
into somebody's cards like that!

919
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:15,640
Hey, don't look!
- I didn't!

920
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:16,560
How dare you.

921
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:17,800
I didn't.
- She did.

922
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:20,270
This is not chess! Be quick.

923
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,100
He has two jokers?
- Yeah.

924
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:24,190
Hey!

925
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,730
How did you know?

926
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:28,550
Don't see my cards.
- Play your card fast.

927
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,030
Gautam, better learn
to be prompt now.

928
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:37,110
You'll have to do
everything doubly fast.

929
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,500
Ajji...

930
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:43,190
I can't believe
we're having twins.

931
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,970
Peshwe the rulers!

932
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:47,150
Single act, double impact!

933
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:50,460
Your Highness,

934
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:53,190
this double responsibility
is going to single you out.

935
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:56,340
Mom, is it true about
synpathetic pain in twins?

936
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,450
What do you mean?
- It is, isn't it?

937
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:02,860
You'll have to get up twice
in the middle of lunch.

938
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:04,670
Why?
- It's Ajji's theory.

939
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,330
When the mother starts
having her meals,

940
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:08,900
the kid invariably
wants to crap!

941
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:11,180
Ridiculous!

942
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:13,390
Ask Ajji.
- It's true.

943
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,420
All babies do that.

944
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:19,620
They're biologically connected
for 9 months you know...

945
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:21,150
If I ask for a simple
glass of water,

946
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:22,220
she doesn't oblige.

947
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,500
You've had it now.

948
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:24,900
Mom please tell him

949
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:27,070
not to blurt out
before random people.

950
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:29,710
He was teling the watchman!

951
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:32,780
"You know what's coming
up in our family..."

952
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:33,990
Really?

953
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:38,430
Gautam, you are not
supposed to tell so soon. - Why?

954
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,350
Not until the ritual
of 'Chor Otee'.

955
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,390
Chor Otee? What's that?

956
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:46,390
It's a discreet blessing
to the expectant mother.

957
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,910
It's done in the third month.

958
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:53,790
To keep it discreet, it's
performed after dark.

959
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:59,150
The baby's organs start forming
by the third month.

960
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,170
Eyes, nose, ears... hands, legs...

961
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:04,320
The foetus starts taking shape.

962
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:06,180
The baby stabilizes in the womb.

963
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,510
That's why the news should
be kept undisclosed

964
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,830
until 3 months are over.

965
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,120
After the Chor Otee, we
are free to announce.

966
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:19,080
Aw jeez! It'll be one member
less in the group now...

967
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:20,870
Delivery is in Mumbai or Pune?

968
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:22,750
Please select impressive names.

969
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:24,030
Not silly tiny ones.

970
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,030
Gauri,
get as much sleep as you can.

971
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,040
Once the baby comes, the
mother can't sleep well.

972
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:29,870
You were trapped in
'Wife Logic' before!

973
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:32,530
Now she's going
to be 'mother' forever!

974
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:35,950
Listen to 'Garbhsanskar'
CDs for genius babies.

975
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:38,350
Why would Pune
need 'Garbhasanskar'?

976
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,790
Beyond Talegaon even the
winds become virtuous!

977
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:45,680
Would be better if you read textbooks
for grades 1 to 5. More useful.

978
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:50,390
Mom and Dad are constantly
on their mobiles.

979
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:53,630
We're going to get glasses
early, thanks to them!

980
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:58,350
The display light totally
messes up our sleep.

981
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:01,830
And the news of twins has
robbed Dad of his sleep.

982
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:05,470
Hello?

983
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:08,510
Sir, sir...
just a second...

984
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:09,870
Please hold on...

985
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:11,460
Hello?

986
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:14,350
One minute... one minute...
Can you hear me now?

987
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:16,460
This is Gautam here.

988
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:20,230
Sir, Gautam Pradhan...
from Naad Studios.

989
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:21,990
Yes... How are you?

990
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:25,310
You had enquired...
about the studio...

991
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,550
Right... So I am now
doing nights too.

992
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:30,550
Oh yes... absolutely.

993
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:33,040
I was wondering if
your requirement...

994
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,090
is still on.

995
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:38,510
Sure... why not...
We can start tonight.

996
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:40,870
I'm available... okay.

997
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,230
Thank you... Sir...
about the advance...

998
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:48,110
Sure, you could keep
it at the reception.

999
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:50,650
Of course...
Thank you sir, thank you.

1000
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:59,746
Hi Viraj, this is
Gautam Pradhan. I had called

1001
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:02,630
for booking the studio.
Call when you're free. Bye.

1002
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:05,870
Hi!
- Hi...

1003
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,390
Let's go?
- Where to?

1004
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:08,430
Sonography.

1005
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,830
Oh... Oh! Slipped my mind!

1006
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:13,630
You're tired.

1007
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:15,110
I walked.
- Why?

1008
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,590
Exercise.... Shubhu Mavshi
said I must.

1009
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,020
I'll book a cab.

1010
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:21,260
I had.

1011
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:22,790
The driver cancelled.

1012
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:24,460
This can only happen in Pune.

1013
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:28,740
Should we take the scooter?

1014
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:30,880
It'll be easier in the traffic.
- Okay.

1015
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:32,110
I'll get my bag.

1016
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:41,130
What?!! On the scooter? So risky!

1017
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:44,110
Bumpy roads, potholes!

1018
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,350
Like Mumbaikars, we speak
in English every now and then!

1019
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:48,550
Oh, sorry!

1020
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:54,110
Mom and Dad have already shown us
how tough the road ahead will be!

1021
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:04,110
Isn't this from the
musical Matsyagandha?

1022
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:05,750
Matsyagandha!

1023
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:09,060
As far as I remember...

1024
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:13,590
Ashalata Wabgaokar has sung it...

1025
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,740
Aai, I got an idea!

1026
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:20,300
Why don't I get the harmonium...

1027
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:21,590
Later...
- Huh?

1028
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:23,230
Later.

1029
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:28,910
How do you explain this?

1030
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,680
Total lack of responsibility,
or discipline?

1031
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,410
Scooter is risky
in this condition.

1032
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,750
Is that so difficult
to understand?

1033
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,120
What's going on?

1034
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:45,050
It's nothing.
- Nothing?!!

1035
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:51,800
We went for a sonography...

1036
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,310
On the scooter.

1037
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:57,610
The baby's position shifted...

1038
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,420
and the sonogram was not clear.

1039
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:02,190
Are you insane Gautam?

1040
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:07,790
It's not enough to
say you're a father!

1041
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:09,420
You have to behave like one!

1042
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:15,260
Nothing doing Gauri.

1043
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:16,830
Come to stay here.

1044
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,390
I'll take you for
doctor's visits.

1045
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,350
Gautam...

1046
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:26,870
If you can't handle
this, tell us already!

1047
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,790
If I say I can't, then what?
- Gautam!!!

1048
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,260
Hey... okay... You
know what I think...

1049
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:36,810
I'm free. I can accompany her...
What say Gauri?

1050
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,910
Hmm...
- That's it.

1051
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:42,560
Shouldn't he understand
his responsibility? - Oh yes!

1052
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:45,740
Shouldn't he care for his kids?
- Of course!

1053
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:47,350
Is he a kid anymore?
- Not at all!

1054
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:50,470
See?

1055
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,830
That's why I didn't want it now.

1056
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:57,010
Look, I'm doing the best I can.

1057
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,440
Okay listen...

1058
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:01,650
I'm feeling hungry...

1059
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:02,900
Let's eat first...

1060
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,660
We can continue
the debate later.

1061
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:05,950
I'm not hungry.

1062
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,470
Gautam...
- Gautam!

1063
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,420
Aai... Aai...
- I'll be back...

1064
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:12,030
Wait... Where are you going?
Sit.

1065
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:15,550
Please... See about dinner...?

1066
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,630
We must eat... no?

1067
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:22,750
I know...

1068
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:24,750
I'm going to be a careless...

1069
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,510
and terrible father.

1070
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:33,270
Don't laugh! It's true.

1071
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,250
I wanted...

1072
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:41,930
to be a father when I could
give my child everything.

1073
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:45,220
I wanted a baby only after

1074
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:47,340
I could afford all that.

1075
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,630
Just like you!

1076
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:52,710
You gave me everything
I ever asked for.

1077
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:56,990
I gave you each and
everthing you ever wanted?

1078
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:58,590
Pretty much so.

1079
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,370
No... I made you think I did.

1080
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:04,400
Let me tell you something...

1081
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:08,710
since we're talking
about this...

1082
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:11,370
At times I have...

1083
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:14,730
lied to you.

1084
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:18,390
Of course...

1085
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:21,760
Of course because of
the circumstances.

1086
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:24,620
You know what I did?

1087
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:27,300
I just made sure
you would stay in love with

1088
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:31,570
your old possessions,
until the new one arrived.

1089
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:33,630
That's all I did.

1090
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,530
I remember...

1091
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:38,790
you once said...

1092
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,630
'I want a season ball."

1093
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:46,310
I said, " Okay, don't worry!"

1094
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:49,530
Then I played 10 overs with you
with your old ball.

1095
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,230
And I let you win.

1096
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,070
You were thrilled.

1097
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:57,470
You forgot the season ball.

1098
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:59,590
How's that?

1099
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:02,750
And yes...

1100
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,310
I just remembered...

1101
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:07,590
Don't know who filled
you with the idea....

1102
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,600
You threw a tantrum
for an ink pen.

1103
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:13,620
An expensive one at that.

1104
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,630
Know what I did?

1105
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:19,710
I helped you write your
essay with your old pen.

1106
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:23,310
The next morning you
showed it in school.

1107
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:25,890
Your essay won the first prize.

1108
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:29,310
Do you know

1109
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:31,200
what that did?

1110
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:33,910
I forgot about the ink pen...?

1111
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:37,190
Absolutely right.

1112
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:56,030
Am I capable of all this?

1113
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,830
Of course!

1114
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:01,070
Why wouldn't you be?

1115
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:04,100
You'll be great.

1116
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:06,940
In your own words...

1117
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:08,390
you will be

1118
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,070
' a good father'.

1119
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:14,470
You're already getting there.

1120
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:23,950
You're already giving up
your good night's sleep

1121
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:26,110
for night recordings!

1122
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:28,110
Isn't it?

1123
01:14:30,330 --> 01:14:33,180
Sacrificing the afternoon
nap is one thing.

1124
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:37,050
But His Highness giving up
a good night's sleep is...

1125
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,350

Listen...
- Yes.

1155
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,210
Somebody's vomiting.
- Yes.

1156
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:03,300
Who could it be?

1157
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,000
Why would neighbours come
to our home to vomit?

1158
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:07,370
Obviously it's Gauri.

1159
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:09,410
Let's check.
- What for?

1160
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:11,670
Haven't we assigned
the job to Gautam?

1161
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:14,140
He??? He's just like you!

1162
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:15,430
Must be fast asleep.

1163
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,230
Oh come on! The sound
is sure to wake him up.

1164
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,830
I'll go.
- Okay.

1165
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:27,310
Gautam...?

1166
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:31,260
Acidity.

1167
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:34,150
Don't laugh at me like -

1168
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:35,910
He's been working nights...

1169
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:41,180
Easy...

1170
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:42,270
Poor thing...

1171
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:49,110
Oh, so it was you
throwing up last night!

1172
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:51,210
Gautam listen...

1173
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,910
It's good to purge
once every few months.

1174
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:56,750
Clears the system.
- Ajji!

1175
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,660
And you're free to eat
whatever you want.

1176
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:03,070
Mom I want tea.

1177
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:05,040
You had acidity last night.

1178
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,350
Better have this.
- Yes!

1179
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,270
Dad!
- What do you want?

1180
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,360
I don't want this.
- How about tamarind?

1181
01:19:11,730 --> 01:19:13,510
Citrus fruits... what do you want?

1182
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,110
Dad, I'm not pregnant!

1183
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,500
Have this.
- Cravings...

1184
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:19,440
How come you have no cravings?

1185
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:21,750
A friend of mine...

1186
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,350
loved the scent
of the wet earth.

1187
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:27,540
She would eat soil!

1188
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,350
Biting the dust is
what she does too!

1189
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,580
Gautam!

1190
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:35,220
Hey! What was that song?

1191
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:37,150
About the cravings for beedi?

1192
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:40,540
Come on! Such a popular song...
- Yes!

1193
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:41,930
Dad...
- Huh?

1194
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:07,870
Tea?
- You join us.

1195
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,456
Why don't you join too?
- Sing with us.

1196
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,640
Laxmi, get tea for everybody.

1197
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,470
Gauri, sing.
- No...

1198
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,070
Hey Shekhar!

1199
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:28,950
Please stop!
- Why???

1200
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:32,070
Why? We can't
find the right note!

1201
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,030
Because of me???
- Yes!

1202
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:42,300
Ladies please...

1203
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:45,670
Take a pause...
- Why?

1204
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:48,790
Why are you singing known songs?

1205
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:52,710
Let's create something original.

1206
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:56,820
Our own song!
- What do you mean?

1207
01:20:56,910 --> 01:20:59,620
Start with a single line...

1208
01:21:00,610 --> 01:21:02,190
Think of a line...

1209
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:03,510
What say?

1210
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:07,670
Hey Dumbo!

1211
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,400
You supposedly make jingles?

1212
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:11,190
Supposedly?

1213
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,670
You do, don't you?

1214
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,540
Yes!
- Then sing a few words!

1215
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:16,590
Me?
- Gautamrao!

1216
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,030
Please sing.

1217
01:21:20,230 --> 01:21:21,910
Sing Gautamrao...

1218
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:25,080
Jiju, jiju, come on.

1219
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:27,030
Why not!

1220
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,380
Why not.

1221
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:30,050
Something like...

1222
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:32,910
You become Mom, I become Dad...

1223
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,280
As a little someone comes along.

1224
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,190
Gautamrao...

1225
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:39,180
How does it come to you?
- Wow Jiju!

1226
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:41,920
You become Mom, I become Dad...

1227
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:45,430
As a little someone comes along.

1228
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,480
You become Grandma,

1229
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:49,890
I become Grandpa

1230
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:54,640
as a little someone
comes along. - Cool!

1231
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:58,960
Okay! Now let's go ahead...

1232
01:21:59,050 --> 01:22:00,050
Baba!

1233
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:02,410
Hey... don't!

1234
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:04,820
May I?

1235
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,760
Of course!

1236
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:09,700
A new sound

1237
01:22:09,790 --> 01:22:10,790
of tiny little feet

1238
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:11,890
Yes!

1239
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,180
A sprouting seed

1240
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:17,270
flourishes

1241
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:19,470
A sprouting seed flourishes

1242
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:22,200
as a little someone comes along...

1243
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:27,390
There you go!

1244
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,070
You become Mom...

1245
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,150
I become Dad...

1246
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:49,850

How can she come for
the drum practice?

1284
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:45,820
She's going to her mother's!

1285
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:47,550
Listen... From tomorrow,

1286
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,700
let's meet at my place
after practice.

1287
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:52,480
My home is now available 24 hours.

1288
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:54,400
Wow! Nice.
- I'll call you back.

1289
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,120
Planning parties
behind my back, huh?

1290
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:59,950
No, no...
- You look so glad I'm going.

1291
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:02,550
It's not that...
- You've already put my bag

1292
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,120
in the door Gautam!
- Oh come on!

1293
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:05,610
I'm asking you not to go.

1294
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:06,970
Sit here.

1295
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:08,930
Yeah, sit...

1296
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:11,010
Don't go!

1297
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:13,380
It's a custom.

1298
01:27:13,950 --> 01:27:15,410
Aai has been waiting so long.

1299
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:18,130
She's registered me at
ShubhuMavshi's clinic in Mumbai.

1300
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:20,450
Do you want to go?
- Nope.

1301
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:22,740
Then don't go.

1302
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,020
Hey Mumbai...
- Yeah?

1303
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,730
I'll be bored without you.

1304
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:30,000
Liar!

1305
01:27:30,090 --> 01:27:32,500
I know you'll watch
horror movies everyday.

1306
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:33,970
And drink beer everyday.

1307
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:36,260
And since I'm not there
you don't need to throw it away.

1308
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,360
I'm not doing
anything of the sort.

1309
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:41,650
Don't leave me al - Hey, hey!

1310
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:44,820
Please! Don't weep
because you miss me.

1311
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:47,110
And don't call.
- Why?

1312
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:49,330
Don't drink beer without me!

1313
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:50,840
Won't agree with you!

1314
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:00,210
Noooo!

1315
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:02,810
Stop it!

1316
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:05,260
No!

1317
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:07,690
Let's go, we're running late.

1318
01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:11,630
No... No... Please stop.

1319
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:14,090
Let's go.

1320
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:17,690
What are you doing Gauri?

1321
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:22,580
Oh come on...
- Hold it...

1322
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:24,240
Admit you don't want to go.

1323
01:28:24,330 --> 01:28:26,570
Why're you playing
with the door!

1324
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,890
You don't want to go Gauri...
- Hang on a minute...

1325
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:33,130
One minute.
- What are you doing?

1326
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,320
Nothing.

1327
01:28:34,450 --> 01:28:36,330
Gauri what are you doing?
- Nothing.

1328
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:38,880
This - This is cheating!

1329
01:28:38,970 --> 01:28:41,900
I can do it too.
I'll open the door and -

1330
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:43,650
What?

1331
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:46,560
Listen.

1332
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:49,770
I won't be around for a few weeks.
- So?

1333
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:53,000
So you'll open the door everyday.
- Yeah...

1334
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:55,850
You'll score more...

1335
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:57,250
A lot.

1336
01:28:59,010 --> 01:29:02,370
Haven't we decided
I'll never lose in this game?

1337
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:13,230
You'll always win.

1338
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:15,690
We've decided.

1339
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,240
I love you Mumbai.

1340
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:25,360
I love you Pune.

1341
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:00,940
Gautamrao, How was the journey?

1342
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:03,200
Not much traffic.
But we took it easy.

1343
01:30:03,290 --> 01:30:04,690
This is a lot.
Can't eat so much.

1344
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:07,910
I made it especially
for Gautamrao.

1345
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:12,290
You remember, right?
- Perfectly.

1346
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:15,130
What?
- Nothing.

1347
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:17,560
Gautamrao this and
Gautamrao that...

1348
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:19,800
Been hearing this all my life!

1349
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:21,966
You were to visit once,
before our wedding...

1350
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:23,630
Aai called me home early

1351
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,890
asked me to makekheer for you

1352
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:28,680
and you never showed up!

1353
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:31,650
I remember clearly.

1354
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:34,340
What's for dessert tonight?

1355
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:36,300
There's mango pulp,
your favourite.

1356
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,050
Awesome!

1357
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:39,840
Gautamrao, top notch!

1358
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:41,700
Yess!!! Top notch!

1359
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:44,100
Excuse me... Gautam
won't have mango.

1360
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,230
Why?
- He's not allowed.

1361
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,600
Sugar???

1362
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:50,640
No, no!
- What then?

1363
01:30:50,830 --> 01:30:53,440
Didn't the nurse say
mango is not allowed...

1364
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:54,990
We are pregnant.

1365
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:57,120
I can't, so you won't.

1366
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,160
Hey, that's not fair.

1367
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:01,000
Gauri... let him be.

1368
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:04,150
I won't eat mango.
- Baba, I love you.

1369
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:06,740
See? Baba is sacrificing
mango for me!

1370
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:10,560
Aai, I won't either.

1371
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,160
Hey, go ahead, eat.

1372
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,680
Eat.
- Please have.

1373
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:23,820
And...
If I have to give up mangoes...

1374
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,740
I'd rather do it
for my daughter!

1375
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:29,040
Well said Gautamrao.

1376
01:31:29,130 --> 01:31:33,650
The father - daughter
bond is magical.

1377
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:37,280
Gautam... suppose
we have two boys?

1378
01:31:37,370 --> 01:31:39,120
Hmm... Good question.

1379
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:44,130
I won't have to give up mangoes.

1380
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:46,820
Smart answer!

1381
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:49,030
Don't even think of
giving up mangoes.

1382
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,460
Maya, please get
some mango pulp. - Yes.

1383
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:18,880
What's that?

1384
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,870
No, no... I was putting
it back properly..

1385
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:23,420
But what for?

1386
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:25,790
I mean -
- Are you sleeping here?

1387
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,600
Would you please come here?

1388
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:30,490
What is it Sunanda?
- I'l keep it properly.

1389
01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:32,750
Sleep comfortably
in the bedroom.

1390
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:33,960
I don't mind it here at all.

1391
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:37,060
Please tell him.
- It'll be comfortable in the room.

1392
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:38,510
This is absolutely fine.

1393
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,860
What's going on?

1394
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:41,960
He insists on sleeping here!

1395
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:44,440
We're asking him to
sleep in the bedroom.

1396
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:46,010
Rashmi can sleep in our room.

1397
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:47,820
Aai, Baba, listen What's wrong?

1398
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:50,190
I need to leave early
for a recording.

1399
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:51,550
So I thought I'd sleep here.

1400
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:53,200
So you'll just get up and leave?

1401
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:54,680
Did I say that?

1402
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:57,600
You'll leave without telling me?

1403
01:32:57,690 --> 01:32:58,770
I don't want to get killed.

1404
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:02,780
Goodnight.

1405
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,830
Baba... I meant...

1406
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:09,190
Aai, he's not
always like that...

1407
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,640
Yeah! I mean...

1408
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:15,040
Is that the way to speak?
- It was on impulse...

1409
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:18,870
She might come in.

1410
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:21,080
I'll miss you.

1411
01:33:22,190 --> 01:33:23,840
Call at least once everyday.

1412
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:25,320
Silly!

1413
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:29,030
I'll call every hour.
- You mean that?

1414
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:30,600
Promise.

1415
01:33:35,690 --> 01:33:37,080
What're you doing?

1416
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:39,120
You know what...
- Huh?

1417
01:33:39,210 --> 01:33:40,920
Now I know...

1418
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:44,190
how hard it must be to hug me.

1419
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:51,820
I'll see you when I see you.

1420
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:09,820
Thank you! Must go to
the bank after this.

1421
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:11,180
Yes...
- Is Gauri up?

1422
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:12,590
I'll check.
- Good morning.

1423
01:34:12,670 --> 01:34:13,910
Hey, good morning.

1424
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,140
Good, you've had your bath.

1425
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:16,610
I can start the washing machine.

1426
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:18,140
Aai, you haven't changed.

1427
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:20,630
I feel like I've gone
back three years.

1428
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:22,900
What do you mean?
- We have to take an early bath

1429
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:24,550
so that you can run
the washing machine!

1430
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:26,750
Of course!

1431
01:34:28,350 --> 01:34:29,700
Back home, Gautam and I

1432
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:32,230
bathe once every two days.

1433
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,550
What?!!
- Just kidding.

1434
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:37,430
Aai, what should I do?

1435
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:38,950
Anything...

1436
01:34:39,790 --> 01:34:41,390
Find something to do.

1437
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:42,510
What a question!

1438
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:46,350
Bathe once in two days?

1439
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,350
Really... Gautam sometimes just

1440
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:50,190
uses body spray and
leaves for work.

1441
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:35,910
So boring...

1442
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:39,630
Aai...
- Yes?

1443
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:41,050
Please tell me what to do...

1444
01:35:43,710 --> 01:35:44,580
Why're you laughing?

1445
01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:46,950
Reminded me of your childhood.

1446
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:49,190
When school holidays
would begin...

1447
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:52,220
you would enjoy
the first few days.

1448
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:54,340
After that you would
start pestering me.

1449
01:35:54,430 --> 01:35:56,630
"Aai, what should I do?"

1450
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:59,470
I would be stumped.

1451
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,600
And?

1452
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:05,510
Nothing... You have to engage
yourself in something.

1453
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,270
That's what I've been doing.

1454
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:11,670
How long? It's
only been half an hour.

1455
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:12,830
No!...Really?

1456
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:14,830
I'm already bored.

1457
01:36:15,550 --> 01:36:16,750
Bored?

1458
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:20,710
Why don't you learn
a few recipes from me?

1459
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,270
Now?!!

1460
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:25,200
When else?

1461
01:36:26,330 --> 01:36:27,550
Gauri...
- Hmm...

1462
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:28,910
What's this?

1463
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:32,400
You can't make anything
except tea and noodles.

1464
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:34,700
You're going to be a mother.

1465
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:36,990
Are you going to
feed the kids pizza?

1466
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:39,900
This is the right time to
learn what you've missed.

1467
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:43,430
Once the baby comes along -
- okay, okay, tell me what to do.

1468
01:36:44,290 --> 01:36:45,430
Cut the bitter gourd.

1469
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:47,940
Bitter gourd...

1470
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:52,070
What's so funny?
- Aai, one minute...

1471
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:54,550
Help me. Please record my video.

1472
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:57,070
Video? About?
- Me and the bitter gourd.

1473
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:59,020
Are you crazy?

1474
01:36:59,110 --> 01:37:00,970
I thought it was only Rashmi.

1475
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:02,940
I don't know how to...

1476
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:05,660
Aai... Aren't I learning
what I missed out on?

1477
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:07,100
You should too.
- But...

1478
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:08,590
But...
- Hold it firmly.

1479
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:11,250
The bitter gourd and I
should both be seen.

1480
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:13,880
Yes...
- Turn the red button on.

1481
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:15,910
I have.
- You've already started!

1482
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,950
Hold it higher... Straight.

1483
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:19,950
Hi!
- Hi...

1484
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:22,340
Aai, that was for Gautam...
- Oh yes...

1485
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:25,350
Finally I'll be
eating bitter gourd.

1486
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,550
I miss you crybaby!

1487
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,790
Don't call him that!

1488
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,360
Aai, please hold it high!

1489
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:32,760
I really miss that nurse.

1490
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:34,830
Aai talks just like her.

1491
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:37,140
I miss you a lot too.
I love you, I miss you..

1492
01:37:37,230 --> 01:37:38,470
Meet me...

1493
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:40,030
So, what's up?

1494
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,120
Oh, sir...

1495
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:43,620
Should we start?
- Absolutely!

1496
01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:08,590
So? What about boyfriends?

1497
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:10,020
Are you mad?

1498
01:38:10,630 --> 01:38:11,630
Why?

1499
01:38:11,710 --> 01:38:12,990
You don't want to marry?

1500
01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:15,230
I don't want to marry.

1501
01:38:16,270 --> 01:38:18,910
Marriage, responsibilities
and then this???

1502
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Not my cup of tea.

1503
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:22,250
Why would I waste so
many years of career?

1504
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:23,750
You're funny.

1505
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:26,270
I'd like to talk to you
about this. Hang on.

1506
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:28,270
Hi, tell me.
- There's good news.

1507
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:30,470
Again?!! Congratulations.

1508
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,630
Silly! Not that.

1509
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:35,730
All the pregnancy gowns

1510
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:37,940
and one piece dresses
you had designed

1511
01:38:38,030 --> 01:38:39,980
are sold out!
- Really?!!

1512
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:41,820
We're getting 5 odd
enquiries everday.

1513
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:44,590
Hey Gauri... please
design some more.

1514
01:38:44,890 --> 01:38:46,440
There's tremendous demand.

1515
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:48,150
Of course, only if you're free.

1516
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:50,770
You bet I'm free! Let's start.

1517
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:53,190
Take addresses from those
interested, get the fabric

1518
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,580
and send me the boxes.

1519
01:38:54,670 --> 01:38:55,670
And remember.

1520
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:57,380
Don't take worn out
saarees, okay?

1521
01:38:57,470 --> 01:38:59,870
Yes, no problem.
- Bye then.

1522
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:01,910
Let's go home.
- But... wait! Easy...

1523
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,100
I'll tell Aai!
- I'll tell you everything!

1524
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:06,110
Don't run!
- Hurry up...

1525
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:09,470
Just one more page...
- Nothing doing. Get up!

1526
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,630
But I'll tidy up later.
- No I'll do it.

1527
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,100
Aai, aai!
- What happened?

1528
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:14,900
Sit here first.
- Listen...

1529
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:16,500
Calm down... what is it?

1530
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:18,190
I got new work!
- Great!

1531
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:20,710
Really?
- Radhika had called.

1532
01:39:21,070 --> 01:39:22,380
I'd told you about my concept...

1533
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:24,130
Recycle your emotions?
- Yes...

1534
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,100
About pregnancy gowns...
- Yes yes...

1535
01:39:27,190 --> 01:39:28,626
It's got lots of likes
on social media.

1536
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:30,380
Yeah?
- Fantastic demand.

1537
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:32,350
About 7 to 8 enquiries everyday!
- Wonderful!

1538
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:33,900
I'm starting work from tomorrow.

1539
01:39:34,690 --> 01:39:35,550
Lovely!

1540
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:37,630
So Aai, I won't
pester you anymore.

1541
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:40,930
Never mind sweetheart.
- Congratulations!

1542
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:42,840
Oh I remembered!

1543
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:44,820
This is fantastic, but...

1544
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:46,610
I have my singing
class tomorrow.

1545
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:49,620
I had promised my friends
I'd bring you along.

1546
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:51,550
You'll meet them, won't you?

1547
01:39:51,830 --> 01:39:52,860
No way, I'm not going.

1548
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:56,420
You don't have to sing, just -
- That's out of the question...

1549
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:58,040
You give it a miss too.

1550
01:39:58,130 --> 01:40:00,450
Why???
- Devotional songs, come on!

1551
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:02,690
Learn a foreign language instead.
- Right!

1552
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:04,350
Or go with her for Zumba.

1553
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:05,690
Sorry, no!

1554
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:07,420
I'm not going!

1555
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,750
You're not old enough
for devotional songs.

1556
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:13,460
She has been singing God's praises
since college days.

1557
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:14,790
Really?

1558
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:18,000
She was Dev Anand's fan.
Because Dev means God.

1559
01:40:41,630 --> 01:40:43,180
Hello.
- Hi!

1560
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:46,210
Finally, we can talk.

1561
01:40:47,730 --> 01:40:50,260
You know what!
Radhika had called...

1562
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:53,670
Hello?

1563
01:40:53,790 --> 01:40:54,790
Yeah...?

1564
01:40:55,190 --> 01:40:56,590
Were you sleeping?

1565
01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:00,910
Hello!

1566
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:02,920
You're half asleep.

1567
01:41:03,710 --> 01:41:05,340
Go back to sleep.
We'll talk later.

1568
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:07,620
I'll call you back.

1569
01:41:07,710 --> 01:41:09,490
Don't forget.
- Bye...

1570
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:18,550
Mom misses Dad a lot.

1571
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:19,950
So sweet...

1572
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:23,470
Don't worry. In a few
months she'll know

1573
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:26,260
it's more depressing
when the maid

1574
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:28,480
doesn't show up for work.

1575
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:39,870
This is Gauri?
- Yes.

1576
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:42,620
Your face is glowing.

1577
01:41:42,710 --> 01:41:45,870
When the mother's face
glows like this...

1578
01:41:46,130 --> 01:41:47,450
it's a girl...

1579
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:49,690
Definitely!

1580
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:53,830
The shape of the belly also
indicates it's a girl.

1581
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:55,280
Is it true Aai?

1582
01:41:56,230 --> 01:41:57,690
My daughter Mini

1583
01:41:57,780 --> 01:41:59,790
worked till her full term.

1584
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:01,910
The pain started suddenly...

1585
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:03,466
and within minutes she was free.

1586
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:05,510
Free to start working again!

1587
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:08,350
Pregnancy has not affected
your sense of humour.

1588
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:10,110
Must keep myself happy...
- Hello!

1589
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,870
I've decided not to be angry.

1590
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,540
The baby is also happy then.
- Okay, I'l tell her.

1591
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:18,420
The boxes sent by your
friend from Pune are here.

1592
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:19,780
They're here? Yay!

1593
01:42:19,870 --> 01:42:21,380
Why didn't you
pick up the phone?

1594
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:23,380
Gautamrao called twice.

1595
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:26,540
He did?
- Yes. He called home then.

1596
01:42:26,630 --> 01:42:29,080
There are 4 missed calls!

1597
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:30,286
Got drowned out in the singing!

1598
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,740
I had kept it on silent mode.
Told you I'd stay back.

1599
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:34,930
Let's hurry home now. Bye...

1600
01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:40,880
Girl for sure...
- See you then...

1601
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:43,990
Easy Gauri...

1602
01:42:44,190 --> 01:42:45,310
My boxes...

1603
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:47,710
Slow down a bit...

1604
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:50,030
Only one?
- Take a look inside.

1605
01:42:51,150 --> 01:42:53,580
Careful!
- Aai, please give me water.

1606
01:42:53,670 --> 01:42:55,580
May I have some tea?
- Of course!

1607
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:56,990
Thank you...

1608
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:51,230
Yay!

1609
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:55,270
Thank you Dad!
Thank you so much.

1610
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,190
I miss all this so much!

1611
01:43:58,390 --> 01:44:01,160
You do? We miss you too.

1612
01:44:02,010 --> 01:44:04,130
Hope Grandpa is missed?

1613
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:06,650
They're kicking away inside...

1614
01:44:07,270 --> 01:44:08,100
Gauri...

1615
01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:11,730
The house seems so
silent without you.

1616
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:14,780
And Gautam has married
someone else.

1617
01:44:14,870 --> 01:44:16,320
Nonsense!
- Dad!

1618
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:19,230
He's married to his studio now.

1619
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:21,510
He's always at the studio!

1620
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,350
Haven't met him in 2 days.
- Exactly.

1621
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,310
He's not picking up
my calls either.

1622
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,510
Replying to messages
after 2 days.

1623
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,260
He'll call today. I'll
give him an earful.

1624
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:34,540
I'm going to tell tell him, " Gautam,...

1625
01:44:34,630 --> 01:44:37,820
Gauri and the babies
don't miss you at all."

1626
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:38,910
Not at all.

1627
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,230
That's like it.

1628
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,380
Once you are back...

1629
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:47,290
the 6 of us will
team up against him.

1630
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:49,230
What say?
- Right.

1631
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:52,590
Okay... Take care.
- Yeah...

1632
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:54,260
Don't bend forward.

1633
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:56,480
That doesn't seem a
viable option anyway.

1634
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:02,480
Bye Dad... Goodnight.
- Bye...

1635
01:45:35,310 --> 01:45:36,350
You're home...

1636
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:37,890
Ajji...

1637
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:39,990
You didn't sleep?

1638
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:42,610
I was...

1639
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:45,920
Tired?

1640
01:45:48,110 --> 01:45:49,670
There was lots of work.

1641
01:45:52,230 --> 01:45:53,740
Did you call Gauri?

1642
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:03,780
She called twice.

1643
01:46:06,990 --> 01:46:08,310
You're busy...

1644
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:11,470
so you don't realize
how the day passes.

1645
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,920
But she feels lonely and
waits for your call...

1646
01:46:16,730 --> 01:46:17,790
I'll call her tomorrow.

1647
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:20,660
Don't forget.

1648
01:46:20,830 --> 01:46:21,830
I won't.

1649
01:46:22,990 --> 01:46:24,870
Goodnight...
- Goodnight.

1650
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:44,740
Cucumber, celery, carrot...

1651
01:46:44,830 --> 01:46:46,470
Nice!
- Hmm...

1652
01:46:47,130 --> 01:46:49,220
Baba... It's Gautam.
Will take a while.

1653
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:51,470
No problem... I'll go
have coconut water.

1654
01:46:53,150 --> 01:46:54,150
Hi!

1655
01:46:54,610 --> 01:46:56,820
Gauri... Where is my...

1656
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:58,990
mobile charging cable...
the spare one...

1657
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:03,020
In a blue pouch on the
right side in my cupboard.

1658
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:08,400
Your cupboard, right side... blue pouch...
- Right.

1659
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:10,790
Gauri, I love you.

1660
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,090
You're awesome.
Okay listen...

1661
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:14,990
I'll hang up now...
the battery is low.

1662
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:17,690
I'l call you back. I must
first find the cable.

1663
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:20,790
Hey, Gauri...

1664
01:47:21,470 --> 01:47:23,070
Found it... Will call back. Bye.

1665
01:47:23,350 --> 01:47:24,390
Okay...

1666
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:17,070
Mom feels the world is passing her by...

1667
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:21,710
But then she decided to
busy herself in her work.

1668
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:25,260
And to go to Pune one
day to surprise Baba.

1669
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:27,990
No way. You're not going
to Pune in this state.

1670
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:29,780
I'll be back soon.

1671
01:48:29,870 --> 01:48:31,910
Aai!...Won't stress myself out at all.

1672
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:33,620
Do one thing.

1673
01:48:33,710 --> 01:48:37,430
Talk to Gautamrao. If he agrees -
- No! It's a surprise.

1674
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:38,630
Don't tell him.

1675
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:41,790
I'll go and see his reaction.
- Huh?

1676
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:44,350
You said you won't
stress yourself!

1677
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:47,560
Visiting the exhibition...
then meeting him...

1678
01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:50,220
Aren't you going
to say something?

1679
01:48:50,310 --> 01:48:51,950
What if I accompany her?

1680
01:48:52,030 --> 01:48:53,170
See?

1681
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:55,190
Aai, can I go?

1682
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,870
Do as you please!
I'm going to bed.

1683
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,470
Shut the door before
you come to bed.

1684
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:03,140
I'm not happy about this at all.

1685
01:49:06,190 --> 01:49:07,390
Baba!

1686
01:49:10,190 --> 01:49:12,300
Are you done? Can I watch TV?
- Yes.

1687
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:14,570
I'll go pack.
- Go, go!

1688
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:15,670
Goodnight.

1689
01:49:21,150 --> 01:49:22,790
Gauri...
- Yes Baba?

1690
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:24,990
The taxi is here.

1691
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:26,270
Yeah...

1692
01:49:26,630 --> 01:49:28,030
I'll get that.

1693
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:30,630
Easy...

1694
01:49:31,110 --> 01:49:33,080
Baba... Thanks.

1695
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:35,270
Nonsense... careful... come on.

1696
01:49:36,850 --> 01:49:38,960
Get the water bottle.
Must leave on time.

1697
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:40,070
Aai...

1698
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:41,470
Yes... It's all ready.

1699
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:44,430
Keep this water bottle.
No food from outside.

1700
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:46,260
Even water.
- Yeah.

1701
01:49:46,350 --> 01:49:47,780
Did you take the charger?
- Yeah...

1702
01:49:47,870 --> 01:49:49,380
Call once you reach.
- Yup.

1703
01:49:49,470 --> 01:49:51,400
I can't rely on him.
- Aai...

1704
01:49:51,490 --> 01:49:54,070
Don't let Gautam know.
It's a surprise.

1705
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:57,870
Look after her. Strictly
no street food.

1706
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:59,670
Not even me?
- Aai, aai!

1707
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:01,580
I'm feeling a bit giddy.
- Oh my God!

1708
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:03,230
Giddy? Give me that bag...

1709
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:05,030
Sit down.

1710
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:07,380
Sit down and relax.

1711
01:50:07,470 --> 01:50:10,100
Suddenly I felt...
- Get some water quickly!

1712
01:50:10,190 --> 01:50:13,260
Not from the fridge!
- The water bottle is in the bag.

1713
01:50:13,350 --> 01:50:14,350
Yes of course.

1714
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:16,620
That's why I was
against the travel.

1715
01:50:16,710 --> 01:50:17,920
Stay calm.

1716
01:50:18,010 --> 01:50:19,640
Nobody listens to me!

1717
01:50:21,070 --> 01:50:22,750
Careful...

1718
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:24,560
Aai your talking
is stressing me out.

1719
01:50:24,630 --> 01:50:27,860
Of course! But do you
care why I do?

1720
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:29,980
And you support her!

1721
01:50:30,070 --> 01:50:33,340
I'm there for her.
- Is it better? Does it pain?

1722
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:37,630
I'll be on tenterhooks until
everything goes well.

1723
01:50:46,430 --> 01:50:47,660
Talk.
- Who is it?

1724
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:50,410
I had called Shubhu Mavshi.
- What for?!!

1725
01:50:50,950 --> 01:50:52,270
She must know!

1726
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:53,580
I'm not speaking.

1727
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:55,830
Shouldn't we ask her advice?

1728
01:50:56,190 --> 01:50:57,430
Tell her!

1729
01:50:57,630 --> 01:50:59,110
Gauri... speak to her.

1730
01:50:59,550 --> 01:51:01,070
Speak... it's on.

1731
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:06,610
Hello Gauri? What's going on?

1732
01:51:07,070 --> 01:51:08,230
Go easy...

1733
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:12,270
It's two lives in your womb...
Isn't it?

1734
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:14,680
Yes Mavshi.
- Don't get excited.

1735
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:18,270
Don't exert yourself, okay?

1736
01:51:18,950 --> 01:51:19,950
Yes.

1737
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:22,830
I'll be in Mumbai on Sunday.
We'll meet then.

1738
01:51:22,990 --> 01:51:24,350
Yeah...
Okay.

1739
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:26,190
Take care.
- Thank you Mavshi...

1740
01:51:26,690 --> 01:51:28,230
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1741
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:01,950
It's Gautamrao!
- Give it to me!

1742
01:52:03,790 --> 01:52:04,950
Hello Jiju!

1743
01:52:05,170 --> 01:52:06,310
Hey Rashmya!

1744
01:52:06,950 --> 01:52:09,350
What's this! You've
forgotten me.

1745
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:11,750
No way!...Saw the photo of
today's breakfast?

1746
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:13,790
Just now. That's why I called.

1747
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:16,260
Give it to me. I want to speak.

1748
01:52:16,350 --> 01:52:17,630
Talk to Aai.
- Yeah.

1749
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:21,920
Hello, Gautamrao...
- Yes Aai...

1750
01:52:22,230 --> 01:52:24,150
Gauri made breakfast today!

1751
01:52:24,350 --> 01:52:25,900
And it's turned out well.

1752
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:27,190
You know what I'm going to do?

1753
01:52:27,260 --> 01:52:30,310
I'm sending Gauri to your home
more often.

1754
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:34,480
Your idea of teaching
her cooking is awesome!

1755
01:52:35,330 --> 01:52:37,070
Would you like to
speak to her father?

1756
01:52:37,610 --> 01:52:39,030
Just a minute.

1757
01:52:40,070 --> 01:52:42,310
Hello, Gautamrao...
- Yes Baba...

1758
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:44,570
When are you coming to taste
Gauri's breakfast?

1759
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:46,160
Very soon.

1760
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:48,590
Gauri...
- It's delicious.

1761
01:52:48,830 --> 01:52:50,150
Coming.

1762
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:53,080
Baba... my phone battery is low.

1763
01:52:53,170 --> 01:52:56,100
I'll charge it and... Baba..

1764
01:52:57,350 --> 01:53:00,480
What happened?
- Low battery. He'll call again.

1765
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:04,630
Baba... How is breakfast?
Is it so bad?

1766
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:07,340
Great!
- Jiju had called.

1767
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:09,100
Called???

1768
01:53:09,190 --> 01:53:11,150
The battery was low.
Said he'd call again.

1769
01:53:11,310 --> 01:53:12,830
You mean none of you spoke?

1770
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:14,890
We did.

1771
01:53:15,550 --> 01:53:18,140
He called when he saw the
photo of the breakfast.

1772
01:53:19,190 --> 01:53:21,070
All of you spoke?
- Hm.

1773
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:22,800
Today it was low battery, huh?

1774
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:26,600
Damn! How can I forget
to charge the phone...

1775
01:53:27,150 --> 01:53:28,550
What rubbish...

1776
01:53:29,850 --> 01:53:31,390
Now it's not getting through.

1777
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:34,870
He should have charged it
if he wanted to talk to me.

1778
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:38,030
Gauri...
- He could talk to everybody except me!

1779
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:39,980
There's no communication
between us anymore!

1780
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:41,190
Gauri listen...

1781
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:43,750
Aai...

1782
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,920
Why is she so mad?
- You stay quiet!

1783
01:53:46,370 --> 01:53:48,930
Mom has started thinking negative.

1784
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,200
Not good.

1785
01:53:50,670 --> 01:53:52,930
They took all precautions...

1786
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:55,120
but it was positive thinking

1787
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:57,080
that kept us strong.

1788
01:53:57,170 --> 01:53:58,890
I'm so proud of us.

1789
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:01,720
What's that?

1790
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:03,410
Our drums group made

1791
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:05,600
a video for me.

1792
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:07,370
Really?
- Yeah...

1793
01:54:07,970 --> 01:54:10,410
How do you carry those huge drums...
- Hmm...

1794
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:13,240
You were never
interested before.

1795
01:54:13,330 --> 01:54:14,930
We don't have that
tradition here.

1796
01:54:15,710 --> 01:54:17,570
I tried once and fell
in love with it.

1797
01:54:18,330 --> 01:54:20,330
I'm missing it.

1798
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:22,950
Just watch now...

1799
01:54:28,730 --> 01:54:30,090
Henceforth be careful...

1800
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:33,850
Don't start immediately
after the delivery.

1801
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:41,220
Hey...

1802
01:54:42,630 --> 01:54:44,410
Don't get all serious.

1803
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:48,140
I mean... I feel
worried you know.

1804
01:54:53,290 --> 01:54:54,290
Careful...

1805
01:54:58,400 --> 01:54:59,400
Gauri...

1806
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:02,130
It's not you...

1807
01:55:05,170 --> 01:55:06,460
But can't help feeling bad.

1808
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:11,820
Gautam doesn't call...

1809
01:55:14,430 --> 01:55:17,860
I'm missing my Pune,
my routine...

1810
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:22,590
Gautam had said...

1811
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:24,900
I'll have to adapt...

1812
01:55:26,580 --> 01:55:28,160
give up a lot of things...

1813
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:31,660
Said my life would
totally change.

1814
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:33,500
Maybe he was right.

1815
01:55:34,510 --> 01:55:35,690
I knew it too.

1816
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:44,700
With a baby...

1817
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:47,460
it's inevitable Gauri.

1818
01:55:50,860 --> 01:55:51,910
Now...

1819
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:55,220
focus on what you would gain

1820
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:58,750
instead of what you
have to give up.

1821
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,190
Is this what I gain?

1822
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:10,500
Aai, Gautam had told me...

1823
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:14,010
he wasn't ready.

1824
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:17,220
That he couldn't handle it.

1825
01:56:19,870 --> 01:56:21,350
Is he avoiding me?

1826
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:23,740
What?!!

1827
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:26,980
I know he wouldn't do that...

1828
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:30,760
But I get the feeling.
And then I feel bad.

1829
01:56:33,910 --> 01:56:36,680
We don't get to talk.
That feels bad.

1830
01:56:38,750 --> 01:56:40,140
Not expecting too much, am I?

1831
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:43,760
Just one phone call everyday.
But it doesn't happen.

1832
01:56:48,700 --> 01:56:50,620
I miss our interaction.

1833
01:56:51,870 --> 01:56:52,870
And...

1834
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:56,890
If this pregnancy was going to
affect our interaction

1835
01:56:56,980 --> 01:56:59,400
I should have reconsidered it.

1836
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:02,800
Kids,

1837
01:57:02,890 --> 01:57:03,970
Mumbai - Pune...

1838
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:05,940
career... will all happen, but...

1839
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:09,660
without Gautam,
life isn't fun at all.

1840
01:57:13,290 --> 01:57:14,440
I want him.

1841
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:25,630
Aai...

1842
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:27,940
I'll just go downstairs.

1843
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:29,660
Now?
- Yeah.

1844
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:31,860
Rashmi is at the gate.

1845
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:34,470
I mean she's reaching.
We'll walk a bit.

1846
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:37,610
Don't go too far.

1847
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:44,740
Aai...

1848
01:57:47,790 --> 01:57:48,870
I'm okay.

1849
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:39,900
Hi...

1850
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:41,770
Busy?

1851
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:46,460
We always thought we
should be so busy

1852
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:48,460
that it occupies all our time.

1853
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:51,610
You've reached there.

1854
01:58:53,580 --> 01:58:55,500
But I'm finding it
difficult to cope.

1855
01:58:56,860 --> 01:58:59,640
Probably because I'm
not too busy myself.

1856
01:59:00,860 --> 01:59:02,980
And we don't get to talk...

1857
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:07,810
Know something Gautam?

1858
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:10,240
You're my...

1859
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:12,700
power bank!

1860
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:14,820
I mean

1861
01:59:15,810 --> 01:59:16,810
all this...

1862
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:18,740
increased weight,

1863
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:21,420
itching, sleeplessness...

1864
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,660
acidity...

1865
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:24,600
would have been fine

1866
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:26,740
if you were around.

1867
01:59:28,580 --> 01:59:29,940
But you aren't.

1868
01:59:31,950 --> 01:59:33,380
I don't expect much.

1869
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:35,940
Just one phone call everyday.

1870
01:59:36,270 --> 01:59:37,620
But it doesn't happen.

1871
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:40,970
Then I get irritable and -

1872
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:45,150
you'd said you'd
call everyday...

1873
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:48,920
Probably you...

1874
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:52,090
don't get the time.
You must be busy.

1875
01:59:54,010 --> 01:59:55,140
Of course,

1876
01:59:55,650 --> 01:59:57,860
Aai, Baba, Rashmya are there.

1877
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:00,350
But you're not.

1878
02:00:01,710 --> 02:00:03,140
It's no fun.

1879
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:08,010
Gautam...

1880
02:00:10,810 --> 02:00:11,810
You know I'm...

1881
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:13,800
a little scared.

1882
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:16,770
I mean...

1883
02:00:16,860 --> 02:00:18,970
what if something happens to me

1884
02:00:19,930 --> 02:00:21,980
before we meet?

1885
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:26,940
I'm reading a book
on pregnancy...

1886
02:00:27,870 --> 02:00:29,420
It says...

1887
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:31,540
childbirth is...

1888
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:33,420
a new lease of life
for the mother.

1889
02:00:33,830 --> 02:00:36,510
Rashmya said, it means
it's death before that!

1890
02:00:38,190 --> 02:00:40,380
That made me think...

1891
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:43,360
What if something happens
to me during pregnancy?

1892
02:00:46,700 --> 02:00:47,740
Listen.

1893
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:50,060
I don't...

1894
02:00:51,470 --> 02:00:53,070
want to die.

1895
02:00:55,060 --> 02:00:56,190
I want to

1896
02:00:57,180 --> 02:00:59,710
live a long life with
you and the babies.

1897
02:01:05,990 --> 02:01:07,300
In case...

1898
02:01:08,620 --> 02:01:11,000
something happens to
me in pregnancy...

1899
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:14,740
you'd be there for our
children, won't you?

1900
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,570
Never leave their side.

1901
02:01:20,250 --> 02:01:22,050
Don't make them feel ignored.

1902
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:23,500
They'll be helpless.

1903
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:26,500
You'll do so much, won't you?

1904
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:33,140
I miss you a lot...

1905
02:01:33,710 --> 02:01:35,180
So thought of
sending this video.

1906
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:38,700
Everyday I feel

1907
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:40,180
you'll call...

1908
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:42,680
and you'll say,
"Open the door."

1909
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:44,740
And I will

1910
02:01:44,830 --> 02:01:48,900
run to the door and
see you there smiling.

1911
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:51,460
And you know...

1912
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:53,300
no, forget it.

1913
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:55,540
You must be busy.

1914
02:01:55,970 --> 02:01:57,090
And tired.

1915
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:01,120
Bye...

1916
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:27,580
Thank you Mavshi.

1917
02:02:27,670 --> 02:02:29,980
Tell Gauri I'll call her.
- Sure!

1918
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:31,070
Bye.

1919
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:40,350
Gauri, open the door.
- Why?

1920
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:41,980
Gauri, open the door.

1921
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:43,780
One minute!

1922
02:02:45,410 --> 02:02:47,780
You're here!
- Gauri, don't ask silly questions.

1923
02:02:47,870 --> 02:02:48,580
Open the door.

1924
02:02:48,670 --> 02:02:51,060
You freak me out by
sending stupid videos!

1925
02:02:51,150 --> 02:02:52,460
Open the door.

1926
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:54,740
Gautam, you're at the door?

1927
02:02:54,830 --> 02:02:57,730
Gauri, if I reach the
door before you do,

1928
02:02:57,820 --> 02:03:01,180
all the points you
had manipulated

1929
02:03:01,270 --> 02:03:02,940
would be a waste.

1930
02:03:03,150 --> 02:03:06,220
You will lose, I will win!

1931
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:09,780
Wait! Firstly, you come
here without telling me,

1932
02:03:10,070 --> 02:03:13,040
Just you wait! I'll open the
door before you get there!

1933
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:16,080
You sure? Hey, Mumbai!

1934
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:18,270
I'll bet you to it.

1935
02:04:04,390 --> 02:04:05,390
Gauri!

1936
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:15,650
Did Gauri see them?

1937
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:18,500
You...

1938
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:21,110
go see her once.

1939
02:09:25,030 --> 02:09:26,030
What is it?

1940
02:09:31,150 --> 02:09:32,860
What do you mean?

1941
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:39,460
I'll talk to you.

1942
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:42,540
Go in.

1943
02:10:07,190 --> 02:10:08,220
Go.

1944
02:11:16,530 --> 02:11:17,690
What did Shubhu Mavshi mean?

1945
02:11:19,510 --> 02:11:21,620
"See her once."... What was that?

1946
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:26,540
I'm...

1947
02:11:26,630 --> 02:11:28,850
I'm really sorry Gauri...
Last few months...

1948
02:11:28,940 --> 02:11:30,640
I didn't find time
because of work.

1949
02:11:30,730 --> 02:11:32,020
I'm really sorry.

1950
02:11:32,910 --> 02:11:34,900
I know, last few months...

1951
02:11:35,190 --> 02:11:37,780
I neglected you.
I'm really sorry. But -

1952
02:11:39,170 --> 02:11:40,790
But I did tell you Gauri,

1953
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:41,880
I'm not ready.

1954
02:11:41,970 --> 02:11:43,140
And I was not ready.

1955
02:11:44,540 --> 02:11:45,540
But...

1956
02:11:45,970 --> 02:11:47,620
I was trying to be ready.

1957
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:50,740
I was trying to
be a good father,

1958
02:11:50,830 --> 02:11:52,780
I was trying... to be
a good human being.

1959
02:11:53,510 --> 02:11:55,160
Like your father, and mine.

1960
02:11:56,480 --> 02:11:57,556
Always standing behind
their children.

1961
02:11:57,580 --> 02:11:58,970
Always giving.

1962
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:01,420
Heros, to their kids.
I was trying.

1963
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:06,880
Then you sent that video?

1964
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:10,380
You vented out.

1965
02:12:11,980 --> 02:12:13,540
Fine... But...

1966
02:12:15,660 --> 02:12:19,320
But why was I
behaving like that...

1967
02:12:20,670 --> 02:12:23,900
Whom do I tell my
side of it Gauri?

1968
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:27,100
Tell me, whom do I talk to?

1969
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:30,380
Who else but you, Gauri.

1970
02:12:31,470 --> 02:12:33,810
I'll talk to you and
you must listen!

1971
02:12:33,900 --> 02:12:35,340
Because... we are a team.

1972
02:12:36,630 --> 02:12:40,540
Haven't we decided to play
the innings together?

1973
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:45,410
Also, of course, that you
will always win... But -

1974
02:12:45,710 --> 02:12:48,020
does that mean you
always have your own way?

1975
02:12:48,110 --> 02:12:49,130
Everytime?

1976
02:12:55,460 --> 02:12:56,750
You decided to reject me and

1977
02:12:56,840 --> 02:12:59,420
came down from
Mumbai to Pune. All by yourself.

1978
02:13:00,590 --> 02:13:02,880
You decided to... so you refused to marry.

1979
02:13:02,970 --> 02:13:04,140
All by yourself.

1980
02:13:04,230 --> 02:13:05,230
And now...

1981
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:08,010
You decided you wanted the baby.

1982
02:13:08,100 --> 02:13:09,620
All by yourself. Then
you convinced me.

1983
02:13:09,710 --> 02:13:11,580
And now that I'm ready...

1984
02:13:12,270 --> 02:13:15,420
Gauri, Shubhu Mavshi asks
me to 'see you once'?

1985
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:19,420
No!

1986
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:27,850
I'm not ready for this Gauri.

1987
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:45,890
I'm not ready for this.

1988
02:14:08,950 --> 02:14:11,200
If you're going to
leave me like this Mumbai...

1989
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:15,600
what's the point?

1990
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:20,210
Whom do I fight with Gauri?

1991
02:14:21,460 --> 02:14:22,990
You were telling
me in the video...

1992
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:25,820
"Never neglect the children."

1993
02:14:26,020 --> 02:14:27,300
What are you doing?

1994
02:14:28,390 --> 02:14:29,390
Dumbo!

1995
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:35,860
If our love story is going
to end like this...

1996
02:14:39,150 --> 02:14:41,740
how can I tell
Gautam-Gauri's story to the kids?

1997
02:14:44,570 --> 02:14:46,330
Don't leave me Mumbai...

1998
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:51,860
Don't leave me...

1999
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:10,480
You talk so much.

2000
02:15:12,780 --> 02:15:14,310
Don't you get breathless?

2001
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:23,700
And please don't give me that...

2002
02:15:25,540 --> 02:15:27,120
'Made in Pune'...

2003
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:30,340
and the 'Charm' nonsense!

2004
02:15:31,210 --> 02:15:33,910
I have no energy
to hear all that.

2005
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:45,390
I told Shubhu Mavshi

2006
02:15:46,650 --> 02:15:48,110
to freak you out.

2007
02:15:53,010 --> 02:15:55,340
For ignoring
me the last few days!

2008
02:16:00,180 --> 02:16:02,220
I didn't respond for
a few minutes...

2009
02:16:03,060 --> 02:16:04,370
and you brought the house down!

2010
02:16:05,140 --> 02:16:06,290
Dramatic character!

2011
02:16:09,670 --> 02:16:11,830
You mean...

2012
02:16:12,860 --> 02:16:16,100
this was a plot hatched
by you and Shubhu Mavshi?

2013
02:16:16,190 --> 02:16:17,190
Yeah...

2014
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:30,260
Did you fall on your
head as a kid Gauri?!!

2015
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:32,620
Don't you shush me!

2016
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:35,370
What were you thinking?

2017
02:16:35,460 --> 02:16:37,260
I did this because I love you.

2018
02:16:37,350 --> 02:16:39,340
It's not about 'I love you'.

2019
02:16:40,460 --> 02:16:41,500
Are you done?

2020
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:44,700
Gautam, Gauri, you're fighting?!!

2021
02:16:44,790 --> 02:16:46,390
You've become parents now.

2022
02:16:47,050 --> 02:16:49,460
Shubhu Mavshi, what was all this?

2023
02:16:50,870 --> 02:16:52,620
Why did you conspire with her?

2024
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:54,930
Just fun... It was her idea.

2025
02:16:55,020 --> 02:16:56,730
She... she's insane.

2026
02:16:56,820 --> 02:16:58,250
I'll tackle her.

2027
02:16:58,340 --> 02:17:00,380
But you... you made me cry!

2028
02:17:00,470 --> 02:17:01,660
It's healthy.

2029
02:17:05,670 --> 02:17:07,910
Look who's here!
- Hi!

2030
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,810
Hi! Congratulations!

2031
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:11,470
Mom and Dad are here.

2032
02:17:52,690 --> 02:17:55,850
Our vision is still blurred.

2033
02:17:55,940 --> 02:17:59,820
But all the voices which
were so faint until now...

2034
02:18:00,060 --> 02:18:03,300
are closer and clearer.

2035
02:18:03,390 --> 02:18:06,820
Everybody's touch
feels so familiar.

2036
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:09,580
We now have a greater
responsibility.

2037
02:18:12,780 --> 02:18:14,940
To bring the both of them closer...??

2038
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:20,900
Because as much as they were
against giving us birth,

2039
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:25,500
We were determined to
come into this world.??
