1
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:28,023
"Golden dreams
and great heartache,"

2
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:45,447
"churn in the depth of the soul
of this river...called life."

3
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:57,027
"When great mountains lay
in its path,"

4
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:03,658
"it cuts deep gorges through
the rock...to keep flowing!.."

5
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:15,631
"This unstoppable, inexhaustible
river called life..."

6
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:34,136
"It is called
the river of life."

7
00:07:17,697 --> 00:07:19,139
Lord Shiva!

8
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:24,392
For all the sins
I have committed,

9
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,870
if death is the only redemption,
then take my life!...

10
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:30,639
But this boy should live...

11
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:35,597
He should live for his mother
who is waiting for him...

12
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:38,687
he should live to ascend
the throne Mahishmati...

13
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,287
Mahendra Baahubali should live!

14
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:15,002
Dear me!

15
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,210
Hey! What are you
waiting for? Hurry!

16
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:26,447
Hey! Be careful!

17
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,917
What happened?
- I am not sure, master.

18
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,314
With all the jewelry on her,

19
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:55,723
she must have been
a queen or something.

20
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:57,921
She died with her
hand pointing up!

21
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:02,409
Master!

22
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,493
What happened?

23
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:08,212
They must have come
here to kill her.

24
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,698
Looks like she got
the better of them.

25
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:14,461
Master!

26
00:09:18,297 --> 00:09:19,947
My God! A cave!

27
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:22,222
We never knew this existed!

28
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,634
Looks like it goes all the way
to the top of the mountain!

29
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:29,791
If the lady was holding the
baby up, pointing to the top,

30
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,632
Maybe she wanted us
to take it back there!

31
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:33,040
You are out of your mind?

32
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:35,559
They sent soldiers
to kill an infant!

33
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:36,884
What dangers do
you think await him...

34
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,798
if you send him back there!
- But, Sanga..

35
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,645
This is my baby.

36
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:43,567
I have no children...

37
00:09:43,723 --> 00:09:45,372
and the river Goddess
has given this boy to me.

38
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:50,298
If anyone of you object,
I will trample upon your necks.

39
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,541
What are you waiting for?
Close the cave.

40
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:05,192
Shiva!

41
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,833
Shiva!

42
00:10:11,231 --> 00:10:12,880
What are you doing here,
my dear?

43
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:14,599
What is up there, mother?

44
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:24,685
There are ghosts
and demons up there!

45
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:26,695
They prey on
and eat little kids!

46
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:28,488
But I want to go up there,
mother!

47
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:30,814
Don't ever say you want
to go up there! Let us go.

48
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:51,959
How many times have I told you
not to climb up there?

49
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,677
Why do you keep doing it?

50
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:56,284
You are my darling, right?
You won't do it again, right?

51
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:48,172
Looks like he will
make it this time.

52
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:50,451
No way!
Look at the water mountain!

53
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,892
It goes way up into the clouds...

54
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,060
...And how many times has he fallen
from that hundred feet?

55
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:53,893
He always slips and falls
after the first hundred feet.

56
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:55,616
Yeah, he slipped and fell
at least a hundred times.

57
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:58,225
Watch!
He is going to come sliding down again.

58
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,017
Shiva!

59
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:36,581
Your mother is up to something there!

60
00:12:37,496 --> 00:12:44,388
'Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva,
Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva!'

61
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:46,594
That is fifteen!

62
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,558
Pour another 101 times and
your prayers will be answered!

63
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:54,635
Sage, if I do this,
will my son listen to me?

64
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:56,761
Will he stop trying to climb
up that mountain?

65
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,527
Of course!
This is a powerful ritual!

66
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,407
Pour this water over Shiva,
with all your heart,

67
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:05,805
and He will guide your son
onto the right path.

68
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,935
Alright! 0! Sage.
- Hail Shiva!

69
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:11,572
Mother, you are not
getting younger, are you?

70
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,337
It won't help you if you
run around so much!

71
00:13:14,454 --> 00:13:16,704
Out of my way!
- Mother, please listen to me!

72
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:19,139
Why should I?
Do you ever listen to me?

73
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:21,862
Father, can you please
tell her to stop?

74
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:23,791
Sanga?
- What?

75
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,346
Where are the flowers?
- Father! Father!

76
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:27,274
Let go of me!

77
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,790
Alright! Let me do it on your behalf.
Okay?

78
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:32,559
No way!
Lord Shiva won't accept it.

79
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:36,003
The one who took the oath
will have to pour the water!

80
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:39,407
Sire, carry on with what you are doing.
- Hail Lord Shiva!

81
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,008
Mother.
- What is it now?

82
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,332
How about I carry you...

83
00:13:44,444 --> 00:13:46,366
and you can pour the water
over Lord Shiva? Fine?

84
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,616
No way!
Lord Shiva won't accept it.

85
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:51,010
The one who took the oath
will have to pour the water

86
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:53,060
and she has to walk up
to pour the water!

87
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:58,587
Sage, are you and your Shiva
planning to kill my mother?

88
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:01,822
How should I know what
the Lord has in store?

89
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,110
Lord Shiva!

90
00:14:11,671 --> 00:14:13,036
Sanga!

91
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:15,162
See what your lad is up to now!

92
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:16,956
What is it this time?

93
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,773
Shiva, stop!

94
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:30,370
You will go to hell for this
blasphemy! Shiva, stop!

95
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:36,743
Shiva.

96
00:14:53,552 --> 00:14:54,633
Shiva, wait".

97
00:14:56,596 --> 00:15:01,249
"The celestial river agitatedly
moving through His matted hair"

98
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,253
"which makes His head shine
with those soft waves."

99
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,503
"And His forehead shining
like a brilliant fire"

100
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:17,657
"and the crescent of moon which
is an ornament to His head"

101
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,865
"makes my mind love Him
each and every moment."

102
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:29,757
"Who is he and
where he comes from?

103
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,715
"He brought with him eternal
light spreading everywhere."

104
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:39,003
"His strong arms can turn
the tide of history."

105
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:42,650
"River Bhagirathi, Lord Shiva
head towards you."

106
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:47,415
"Look at this great irony."

107
00:16:14,313 --> 00:16:18,999
"The consort of the sportive
daughter of the mountain"

108
00:16:18,998 --> 00:16:25,169
"whose mind rejoices
at Her side long glances."

109
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:30,651
"With the stream of merciful
look which removes hardships"

110
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,900
â€œMakes my mind
take pleasure in Him"

111
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,456
"who wears the directions
as apparel."

112
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,144
"With the lustrous gem"

113
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,422
"on the serpent's hood
in His matted locks."

114
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:44,672
"He, who is with His bride
whose face is decorated"

115
00:16:44,824 --> 00:16:47,915
"by the melting of
red saffron vermillion."

116
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,194
"And who wears on His shoulder
the hide of the elephant"

117
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:56,597
"which was blind
with ferociousness."

118
00:16:56,596 --> 00:16:58,846
"Makes my mind happy
and contented in Him"

119
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:02,169
"who is the leader of demons."

120
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,342
Mother!

121
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:24,751
Not just a thousand
showers for your Lord,

122
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:28,115
He will bathe all the time now.
Are you happy now?

123
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:31,357
Yes..

124
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:30,411
Sage, it played out
just like you predicted!

125
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,975
My son hasn't looked up
at that waterfall since.

126
00:18:35,095 --> 00:18:37,858
Do you ever underestimate
Lord Shiva's power?

127
00:18:38,337 --> 00:18:41,549
But now he sits staring
at the wooden mask

128
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:45,513
that fell on the Shivalingam
from above.

129
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:46,910
Now what is with that?

130
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:51,631
Lord Shiva works
in mysterious ways.

131
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,200
Only He would know.

132
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:54,314
A small doubt.

133
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:56,324
Since my son was
the one who made sure

134
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:57,801
the idol is bathed
all the time.

135
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,400
Will his wish of climbing
up the mountain come true

136
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,841
or will Sanga's
wish of him always

137
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:03,082
staying down here come true?

138
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:06,655
To hell with your doubts.
My son did what he did for me!

139
00:19:07,006 --> 00:19:09,770
My wish will be fulfilled.
Isn't that right?

140
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,816
Lord Shiva does whatever
He thinks. Hail Lord Shiva!

141
00:19:14,814 --> 00:19:16,583
Hail Lord Shiva!

142
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:18,385
What did he say?

143
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,313
Shiva!

144
00:19:26,305 --> 00:19:28,511
How long are you going
to sit holding that wooden mask?

145
00:19:28,507 --> 00:19:30,757
There is somebody up there.

146
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,240
Maybe there is, but your mother
is calling out to you.

147
00:19:33,392 --> 00:19:35,675
Let us go home.
- Go ahead. I will come later.

148
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:37,083
Let us go, boys.

149
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,647
Who are you?
Why did you come to me?

150
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,799
"My heart is lost."

151
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:02,650
"Like a drop in the waves."

152
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:08,292
"I am the one whose
eyes shine amidst the stars"

153
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:11,891
"I am the one who
sings amidst the waterfalls"

154
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:16,584
"My voice echoes through
streams, listen to me!"

155
00:21:18,017 --> 00:21:22,790
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

156
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:28,709
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

157
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:34,722
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

158
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:41,449
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

159
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,119
"I breathe for you..."

160
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:16,115
"and only you"

161
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:22,723
"Come and let us live together."

162
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:28,055
"Let me tell you something,
my love."

163
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:35,183
"I chose you as my soul mate."

164
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:41,790
"Whether I stumble and fall,
with haste I will come."

165
00:22:41,781 --> 00:22:45,986
"I am but a sudden gust of wind.
I stop for no one."

166
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:53,802
"I will break free of every
mountain in no time."

167
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:58,326
"He is strong and without an
equal adversary who can fight."

168
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,292
"His anger will cause
new fears in his foes."

169
00:23:05,724 --> 00:23:10,213
"He is strong and without an
equal adversary who can fight."

170
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:16,584
"His anger will cause
new fears in his foes."

171
00:23:56,696 --> 00:24:01,495
"You come out of blue
with a gift of love."

172
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:13,961
"Drop a word and I swear"

173
00:24:15,314 --> 00:24:19,923
"I will give up my life for you."

174
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:27,415
"Scaling peak impossible, his
blood flows like a rivulet."

175
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:33,338
"His sturdy body, a weapon.
Hail this hero of the world."

176
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:39,507
"Destructive in the air and sky
can win with his roar of war."

177
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:45,425
"A ferocious warrior will become
soft-hearted afterwards."

178
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:48,629
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

179
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,638
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

180
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,838
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

181
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:57,520
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

182
00:24:57,756 --> 00:25:00,608
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

183
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:03,206
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

184
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:07,855
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

185
00:25:09,168 --> 00:25:14,138
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

186
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:20,308
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

187
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:26,269
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

188
00:25:27,186 --> 00:25:28,475
"The persevering one.."

189
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:33,240
"Hey, warrior. Come closer!"

190
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:41,209
"Hey, handsome. You are mine."

191
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:41,984
Hey!

192
00:26:44,463 --> 00:26:46,353
Hey! Stop!

193
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,354
Stop!

194
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,092
Over there!

195
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:28,955
Kasi!

196
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:50,536
It is a trap. Kill them!

197
00:28:07,706 --> 00:28:09,028
Dear God!

198
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:29,813
How come you got this?

199
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,932
One of your men,
sneaked into our kingdom.

200
00:28:32,932 --> 00:28:36,504
He tried to rescue Devasena.
We killed him.

201
00:28:37,255 --> 00:28:39,823
It was tied to his wrist.
l took it from him.

202
00:28:40,138 --> 00:28:41,668
I don't know anything else.

203
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,950
Let me go! Let me..

204
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:55,198
Bury the dead
and leave no traces.

205
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:36,239
Dilip too has attained
martyrdom, chief!

206
00:29:49,368 --> 00:29:52,098
Don't let the drop of tear
breach your eyelids.

207
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:57,023
That monster from the palace
has imprisoned our princess

208
00:29:57,015 --> 00:29:58,664
and has her shackled
right in the town square.

209
00:30:07,947 --> 00:30:11,158
Our Queen Devasena being
treated like cattle in a fair.

210
00:30:17,836 --> 00:30:21,801
Our pride and honour is injured
and we suffer in silence.

211
00:30:21,801 --> 00:30:24,924
It is not time to shed tears.

212
00:30:25,244 --> 00:30:27,013
It is time to breathe fire.

213
00:30:29,688 --> 00:30:31,938
Have you forgotten
your solemn oath?

214
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:34,734
We will remember it
till our last breath.

215
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:35,781
To meet our goal

216
00:30:35,974 --> 00:30:38,060
we will clash with thunder"
- We won't lose courage.

217
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:40,347
Come hell or high water"
- We will be brave!

218
00:30:40,498 --> 00:30:42,420
Or death that splits us in pieces..
- We won't budge!

219
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,950
We shall rescue Devasena!

220
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,076
If we are to achieve our goal..

221
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:05,692
"Attachments become
our weakness..."

222
00:31:06,245 --> 00:31:08,571
"and there is no place for
joy or celebrations."

223
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:10,813
"Our body is for our lost
Motherland, Kuntala Kingdom..."

224
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,979
"and soul exists
only to free Devasena."

225
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:22,064
My leader...

226
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,663
I heard many good things
about a warrior...

227
00:31:24,663 --> 00:31:26,509
called Kattappa of Mahishmati.

228
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:30,429
I heard he is a good man.
Couldn't we ask him to help?

229
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:32,678
Karikala Kattappa Nadaar.

230
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:34,961
He is indeed a good man.

231
00:31:35,673 --> 00:31:38,240
He can help us if he wants to.

232
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:42,609
But he won't...

233
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:47,087
Kattappa is a slave
the throne of Mahishmati.

234
00:31:55,734 --> 00:31:56,902
Kattappa.

235
00:31:58,136 --> 00:32:01,228
A sword trader, Sheik Aslam Khan
from Kabul is here to see you.

236
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:16,355
The ore is extracted from
the depths of Baghdad mines.

237
00:32:16,995 --> 00:32:19,321
Purified in the furnaces
of the Golan mountains.

238
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:22,729
Crafted by the best
blacksmiths in Persia.

239
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:27,414
With this in hand...

240
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:30,296
even a child can slice
through ten banyan trees.

241
00:32:34,172 --> 00:32:35,941
I call this the Sikander.

242
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,657
The Pride of Swords.

243
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:46,913
A wonderful sword.

244
00:32:47,186 --> 00:32:50,911
But forgive me, Aslam,
this cannot match our speed.

245
00:32:52,711 --> 00:32:53,879
How insulting!

246
00:32:57,395 --> 00:33:02,081
Spoken words and spilled blood
can never be taken back.

247
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:07,450
Duel with my sword and
prove the worth of your words.

248
00:33:35,273 --> 00:33:37,195
Does that prove
my point, Kattappa?

249
00:33:59,817 --> 00:34:01,467
I have traveled
across the world

250
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,229
China, Persia, Mongolia, Greece.

251
00:34:03,782 --> 00:34:05,792
But never seen
a warrior like you.

252
00:34:06,265 --> 00:34:09,476
It will be an honour
to break bread with you.

253
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,354
Please come, Kattappa.
- Please forgive me, Aslam.

254
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,000
Slaves here do not
dine with royal guests.

255
00:34:16,995 --> 00:34:18,043
Slave?

256
00:34:19,317 --> 00:34:23,806
You are the head of the armoury,
how can you be a slave?

257
00:34:23,802 --> 00:34:26,445
Yes, Aslam. A slave
like you have never seen before.

258
00:34:26,604 --> 00:34:28,450
He forges the weapons for war.

259
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:31,578
During war, he must protect
the king with his own life.

260
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,974
After the war,
he should still lay by his feet.

261
00:34:37,095 --> 00:34:41,541
Tell me, what will it cost
to buy your freedom?

262
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,624
I will pay 10, even 100 times that
to buy your freedom.

263
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:49,195
You cannot put a price
on this slave, Aslam.

264
00:34:49,508 --> 00:34:53,320
My ancestors pledged that
everyone born in our clan...

265
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:56,836
will serve the throne
of Mahishmati for life.

266
00:34:57,556 --> 00:34:59,926
For a pledge that
a long forgotten ancestor made

267
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:01,840
you still..

268
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,890
People who made the pledge
might be dead

269
00:35:03,882 --> 00:35:07,093
but their word
still lives on, Aslam.

270
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:11,658
For this life, these bonds
will stay tied to this land.

271
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:17,297
If loyalty has a face,
it is you, Kattappa.

272
00:35:18,776 --> 00:35:20,426
If you ever need anything...

273
00:35:20,698 --> 00:35:23,309
please don't ever forget that
you have a life-long friend.

274
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:48,613
Vaishali.

275
00:35:50,689 --> 00:35:52,295
Where are you going?
- I will be right back.

276
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:36,755
We have a golden opportunity

277
00:37:36,915 --> 00:37:38,564
to fulfill the oath
we have taken.

278
00:37:38,837 --> 00:37:41,884
They are celebrating
Bhallaladeva's birthday

279
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,769
on the next new moon.

280
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:46,689
The entire kingdom will be busy
with the celebrations.

281
00:37:49,007 --> 00:37:51,050
The opportunity to
free Queen Devasena...

282
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:54,774
Give me the opportunity, sir!
- Chief, let me go!

283
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:57,143
I offer it to Avanthika,
this time.

284
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:02,504
Avanthika!

285
00:38:13,872 --> 00:38:15,401
What is this, Avanthika?

286
00:38:18,636 --> 00:38:19,958
Where did this come from?

287
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:24,327
You focused on your beauty
more than your oath!

288
00:38:26,044 --> 00:38:30,249
You cannot put your life at stake
since you love yourself so much.

289
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:33,259
You are not worthy
of this honour. Leave us.

290
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:47,073
These tears are not
a reflection of my cowardice

291
00:38:48,507 --> 00:38:50,757
nor do they come from pain.

292
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:57,043
They are a testament
to my boiling blood.

293
00:38:58,716 --> 00:39:01,688
If you can feel their intensity

294
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:05,243
then let me go.

295
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,542
You have to leave in two days.
So get ready.

296
00:39:16,975 --> 00:39:19,225
Be careful and get
the job done, Avanthika.

297
00:39:19,377 --> 00:39:21,508
If you get caught because
of your own neglect...

298
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,783
Bhallaladeva will torture you
mercilessly before he kills you.

299
00:39:52,450 --> 00:40:00,741
"Our Mahishmati Kingdom
shall remain unconquerable."

300
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:10,434
"As long as the sun, moon
and stars are shining there."

301
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:28,571
"Felicity and glory
reigns supreme here."

302
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:35,215
"A flourished kingdom,
happy subjects"

303
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:39,626
"and the home of peace."

304
00:40:48,987 --> 00:40:57,998
"May the glory of Mahishmathi
soar sky high."

305
00:40:57,995 --> 00:41:01,720
"Our flag with the emblem
of the rising sun"

306
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:05,924
"our golden throne
flanked by to stallions."

307
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,036
Your Majesty,
it is just been two days since

308
00:41:34,032 --> 00:41:35,801
we caught that bull
in the forests.

309
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:39,125
We haven't broken it yet.
It is quite dangerous...

310
00:41:39,117 --> 00:41:40,679
Minister!

311
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:46,645
It would take 10 such bulls
to intimidate Bhallaladeva.

312
00:41:47,565 --> 00:41:48,887
Please come.

313
00:42:48,506 --> 00:42:49,708
Stamp it out, Bhalla!

314
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:54,072
Yes!

315
00:43:00,037 --> 00:43:01,086
Kill him, father.

316
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,052
Did you see, grandfather?

317
00:43:14,452 --> 00:43:16,178
His Majesty overpowered
the bull.

318
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:18,263
Glory to the king!

319
00:43:18,256 --> 00:43:20,178
That was a great feat.

320
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,030
Bravo, Your Majesty!

321
00:43:55,653 --> 00:43:56,778
Bhallaladeva!

322
00:44:00,417 --> 00:44:01,378
Father!

323
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:02,984
He did it!

324
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,191
Have you ever seen a mightier warrior!
- No, Prince!

325
00:44:12,631 --> 00:44:16,956
Your loyalty amuses me,
Kattappa.

326
00:44:19,637 --> 00:44:21,166
I know deep in your heart...

327
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,364
you nurture this
desire to kill me.

328
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:28,647
Yet you put your life
on the line to save mine.

329
00:44:29,087 --> 00:44:30,376
How do you do it?

330
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:32,898
How do you manage to do this?

331
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,498
Alright! You deserve it!
Ask for a reward.

332
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:40,106
Ask for anything!

333
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,785
Your Majesty!

334
00:44:44,062 --> 00:44:49,469
You have been holding Devasena
captive for 25 years.

335
00:44:50,948 --> 00:44:52,357
Please release her.

336
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:00,967
So be it.
Since I have given my word.

337
00:45:01,439 --> 00:45:05,164
Go and kill Devasena
and release her!

338
00:45:07,965 --> 00:45:12,978
There is no greater liberation
than death! Go and release her!

339
00:45:15,053 --> 00:45:16,375
No?

340
00:45:17,895 --> 00:45:19,784
Then let her suffer.

341
00:45:20,898 --> 00:45:23,782
Not just another 25 years,
but till she dies.

342
00:45:57,776 --> 00:46:01,424
Hey old hag! Get up!

343
00:46:08,826 --> 00:46:10,071
Hey! Get up.

344
00:46:47,185 --> 00:46:51,990
Hey Devasena! I hope there is
nothing lacking in your torture!

345
00:46:54,992 --> 00:46:58,236
You chose him over me.

346
00:46:59,677 --> 00:47:01,763
So where is he now?

347
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:06,124
Tell me the truth, Devasena.

348
00:47:06,884 --> 00:47:08,610
In all these years...

349
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:13,095
have you ever heard
anyone even utter his name?

350
00:47:15,613 --> 00:47:19,186
On those long and dark night,
amid the desperate silence...

351
00:47:19,738 --> 00:47:22,468
and in the clunk
of your shackles...

352
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,863
did you ever hear his name?

353
00:47:29,707 --> 00:47:30,712
No.

354
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:35,076
Mahishmati has forgotten him,
Devasena.

355
00:47:35,473 --> 00:47:37,920
They neither talk
about him anymore...

356
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,366
and nor do they remember him.

357
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:44,890
There are only two people in
this kingdom that remember him.

358
00:47:45,723 --> 00:47:47,405
You and I.

359
00:47:48,205 --> 00:47:51,493
You remember him as you want
to see him before you die.

360
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:55,216
And I remember him
as I want to kill him again...

361
00:47:55,212 --> 00:47:56,774
with my bare hands.

362
00:47:59,497 --> 00:48:01,703
But both our wishes
will remain unfulfilled.

363
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,256
Lady Devasena!

364
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,184
At least, accept it now.

365
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,022
You just have to say yes...

366
00:49:24,021 --> 00:49:26,424
and I will break these shackles
and set you free.

367
00:49:28,746 --> 00:49:30,876
Do you want to be a prisoner
for all your life?

368
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:34,593
No, Kattappa.

369
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:40,158
My son will come
and he will set me free.

370
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,482
How can your dead child
come back for you?

371
00:49:45,162 --> 00:49:46,691
My son is alive.

372
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:50,529
He will come looking for me!

373
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:52,731
You are suffering
in the name of a son...

374
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,297
who is no longer alive,
My Lady!

375
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:58,704
Please get a grip on yourself.

376
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:01,940
I won't get a chance
like this once again.

377
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,784
The guards on the night shift
will be here any moment.

378
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:06,985
Please agree!

379
00:50:08,225 --> 00:50:09,754
Please accept it.

380
00:50:10,988 --> 00:50:15,160
I am begging you and you
keep doing these silly things!

381
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:31,337
Do you think I am picking twigs
like a mad woman, Kattappa?

382
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,339
This is a funeral pyre!

383
00:50:39,296 --> 00:50:43,349
This is for a funeral pyre
to burn to ashes...

384
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,913
the body and the
blood of Bhallaladeva.

385
00:50:51,068 --> 00:50:52,597
My son will come...

386
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,797
he will drag that animal...
and place him on this pyre.

387
00:50:56,313 --> 00:50:58,684
My son will make me
light the pyre...

388
00:50:58,836 --> 00:51:00,999
while Bhalla is still alive.

389
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:04,329
The death cries of
Bhallaladeva will reverberate...

390
00:51:05,002 --> 00:51:08,246
beyond the walls
of Mahishmati.

391
00:51:09,407 --> 00:51:11,296
My son will come!

392
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,710
What happened, Avanthika?

393
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:29,187
Someone right here tattooed
my hand last night.

394
00:51:31,028 --> 00:51:34,119
He will come back
once he sees me.

395
00:53:15,533 --> 00:53:18,340
Avanthika?
What is on your shoulder?

396
00:53:27,544 --> 00:53:29,947
Avanthi..
- Go ahead, I will see you later!

397
00:53:29,947 --> 00:53:31,192
Avanthi, listen!

398
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:58,336
You saw the painting on your shoulder?
Did you like it?

399
00:54:00,297 --> 00:54:02,668
Why that sour face?
Can you smile a little?

400
00:54:15,312 --> 00:54:16,360
Q" My God!

401
00:54:16,594 --> 00:54:18,483
Hey! What is with the arrows?

402
00:54:18,475 --> 00:54:20,124
You want to kill
this hunk of a man!

403
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,963
Who are you?
- That is better.

404
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:26,928
My name is Shiva.
I come from village Ambuli.

405
00:54:26,924 --> 00:54:28,486
I climbed this huge
mountain just for you..

406
00:54:33,651 --> 00:54:34,776
What a girl!

407
00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:03,040
See, you should listen.
Now you are in a hole.

408
00:55:06,363 --> 00:55:07,324
Avanthika?

409
00:55:16,293 --> 00:55:19,461
Now tell me who are you?
- I am telling the truth.

410
00:55:19,456 --> 00:55:20,865
I climbed up the mountain..
- Shut up.

411
00:55:21,538 --> 00:55:23,789
It is possible only for the
likes of the great Lord Shiva!

412
00:55:23,781 --> 00:55:25,463
That is what I am saying.
I am Shiva!

413
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:32,758
I will tell you.
I will tell you everything.

414
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:38,360
But before that I have
to ask you one thing. - What?

415
00:55:38,355 --> 00:55:42,844
Who are you? Who are you?

416
00:55:49,886 --> 00:55:50,814
You got a sword in your hand.

417
00:55:50,968 --> 00:55:54,212
Not to mention body armour, anger
sparks flying from your eyes.

418
00:55:54,892 --> 00:55:57,339
I am not asking about
this mask of yours!

419
00:55:57,655 --> 00:56:01,227
I want to know the one
that is hidden beyond it.

420
00:56:05,783 --> 00:56:06,831
Shall I tell you?

421
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,593
You are a woman and I am a man.

422
00:56:15,192 --> 00:56:16,841
I have come here to love you.

423
00:56:54,431 --> 00:56:56,517
Now that hurts.

424
00:59:01,678 --> 00:59:02,923
This is mine.

425
00:59:04,361 --> 00:59:06,087
I dropped it near the waterfall.

426
00:59:08,725 --> 00:59:13,575
Did you really scale
the mountains to reach me?

427
00:59:15,732 --> 00:59:16,781
Just for me?

428
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:21,627
I came all the way just to see
the smile behind the mask.

429
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,229
I still don't see it.

430
00:59:48,726 --> 00:59:53,815
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

431
00:59:53,811 --> 00:59:59,305
"Let there be thirst for love
and let our love grow",

432
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:05,904
"Listen to what
my heart echoes."

433
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:10,950
"Let the time stand still
and while love makes us alive."

434
01:00:10,948 --> 01:00:15,753
"The life I lived all
these years has no value"

435
01:00:15,752 --> 01:00:20,166
"But now I want to live for you."

436
01:00:20,597 --> 01:00:25,370
"I made a pact with my heart."

437
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:30,492
"I will be born a hundred times
for you."

438
01:00:30,487 --> 01:00:35,172
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

439
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:40,946
"Let there be thirst for love
and let our love grow",

440
01:01:01,038 --> 01:01:05,527
"I will write our love saga
on the skies."

441
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:10,331
"Let us be together for
the rest of our lives."

442
01:01:10,607 --> 01:01:20,186
"Write it with your eyes and
make my heart your canvas."

443
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:24,141
"Being in love is so lovely."

444
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:29,313
"The life I lived all
these years has no value"

445
01:01:29,306 --> 01:01:34,156
"But now I want to live for you."

446
01:01:34,151 --> 01:01:43,490
"I made a pact with my heart. I will be
born a hundred times for you."

447
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:48,774
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

448
01:01:48,765 --> 01:01:53,691
"I am growing thirsty for love,
let there be love."

449
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:58,820
"Listen to what
my heart echoes."

450
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:04,342
"Let the time stand still
and while love makes us alive."

451
01:02:25,762 --> 01:02:29,334
This is something
the world has never seen.

452
01:02:29,486 --> 01:02:32,173
A hundred foot
tall golden statue.

453
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:35,059
Even the Gods don't
get this honour.

454
01:02:35,411 --> 01:02:37,181
Once this is erected,

455
01:02:37,454 --> 01:02:40,218
your son,
our King Bhallaladeva's prestige...

456
01:02:40,376 --> 01:02:42,463
will live on forever
in the entire world.

457
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:47,825
Are all the arrangements done?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

458
01:02:47,824 --> 01:02:49,834
There will be celebrations galore.

459
01:02:49,986 --> 01:02:53,558
The applause and the din
will be unprecedented, My Lord!

460
01:03:17,094 --> 01:03:18,262
Avanthika..

461
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:55,893
Frisk her!

462
01:04:30,206 --> 01:04:31,375
Attack!

463
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:30,955
Baahubali..

464
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:37,474
My Lord! Forgive me, My Lord!
Please don't kill me!

465
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:41,439
My Lord! Forgive me, my Lord.

466
01:05:48,925 --> 01:05:50,247
Forgive me.

467
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:25,349
Shiva!

468
01:08:13,229 --> 01:08:15,556
Please forgive me, Shiva.

469
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,154
I didn't know what else to do.

470
01:08:19,235 --> 01:08:22,403
I cannot let go of you
nor can I abandon my duty..

471
01:08:22,959 --> 01:08:24,761
You are mine, Avanthika.

472
01:08:25,722 --> 01:08:27,732
Everything that is yours
is mine.

473
01:08:29,686 --> 01:08:31,696
I also share your obligation.

474
01:08:41,537 --> 01:08:43,820
I don't know who Devasena is.

475
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,430
If your goal is to free her

476
01:08:48,665 --> 01:08:50,150
then I will bring her back!

477
01:08:52,108 --> 01:08:53,430
This is my word.

478
01:08:58,515 --> 01:09:03,048
"The pyre is lit and
I feel choked."

479
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:06,764
"Nevertheless there is a
yearning in my heart"

480
01:09:07,604 --> 01:09:16,583
"Will there be sunrise again,
ask these shackles of mine?."

481
01:09:16,572 --> 01:09:20,985
"0 Kingdom! see who
comes your way."

482
01:10:18,274 --> 01:10:21,879
Mahishmati,
you can breathe now.

483
01:10:22,878 --> 01:10:24,725
My son is back.

484
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:27,283
Baahubali is back!

485
01:11:44,881 --> 01:11:46,170
When the king's statue
is erected...

486
01:11:46,163 --> 01:11:47,408
everyone must applaud!

487
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:49,485
When the king's statue
is erected

488
01:11:49,485 --> 01:11:50,894
everyone must applaud!

489
01:12:34,491 --> 01:12:35,856
No worries!

490
01:12:36,172 --> 01:12:38,182
It is a hundred foot statue.

491
01:12:38,174 --> 01:12:40,741
Won't it take a sacrifice
of a hundred heads?

492
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:41,765
Thank you.

493
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:53,617
Baahubali..

494
01:13:54,891 --> 01:13:58,015
Baahubali?
- Baahubali.

495
01:13:58,014 --> 01:14:00,504
Baahubali!
- Baahubali!

496
01:14:00,496 --> 01:14:04,625
Baahubali! Baahubali!

497
01:14:07,704 --> 01:14:10,030
Move it!
- Baahubali! Baahubali!

498
01:14:10,026 --> 01:14:12,636
Baahubali! Baahubali!

499
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:19,123
Baahubali! Baahubali!

500
01:14:19,996 --> 01:14:22,563
Baahubali! Baahubali!

501
01:14:27,403 --> 01:14:31,215
Baahubali! Baahubali!

502
01:14:33,529 --> 01:14:34,697
Hey!

503
01:14:35,331 --> 01:14:36,499
Who was that?

504
01:14:40,617 --> 01:14:45,750
Baahubali! Baahubali!

505
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:17,336
Baahubali! Baahubali!

506
01:15:20,536 --> 01:15:23,583
Baahubali! Baahubali!

507
01:15:26,903 --> 01:15:28,825
Baahubali! Baahubali!

508
01:15:50,446 --> 01:15:51,614
Baahubali!

509
01:15:54,410 --> 01:16:02,908
Baahubali! Baahubali!

510
01:16:39,255 --> 01:16:41,865
It is been fifteen days
since my son left! - Hold this.

511
01:16:42,058 --> 01:16:43,707
He hasn't returned yet.

512
01:16:43,859 --> 01:16:45,628
I wonder if he is alright.

513
01:16:45,781 --> 01:16:47,431
Our son carried Lord Shiva's idol
all by himself,

514
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:48,392
What can happen to him?

515
01:16:48,624 --> 01:16:50,787
If he is alright,
why isn't he back?

516
01:16:50,946 --> 01:16:53,316
Maybe he found his family.

517
01:16:53,469 --> 01:16:55,479
He must have realized
we are his foster parents.

518
01:16:55,631 --> 01:16:58,318
Will he never come? Will he not
call me mother again? - Sanga.

519
01:16:58,514 --> 01:17:00,283
People, hurry up, will you?

520
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:14,777
Come on.

521
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:24,508
Earlier you saw the fire
in my eyes and

522
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:26,506
trusted me to
carry out the mission.

523
01:17:26,662 --> 01:17:29,666
Once again I request you
to have that belief in me.

524
01:17:30,426 --> 01:17:34,391
I know Shiva will rescue
Queen Devasena. Come with me.

525
01:17:37,072 --> 01:17:37,596
Alright!

526
01:17:42,317 --> 01:17:46,250
"Mahasena!"

527
01:17:51,047 --> 01:17:52,456
Who says that Baahubali,

528
01:17:52,608 --> 01:17:55,098
the one who showed us the
righteous path is no more?

529
01:18:01,577 --> 01:18:03,860
I am nothing, but a living dead.

530
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:08,945
You are dead and yet you are
alive in people's heart.

531
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:17,915
Baahubali! Baahubali!

532
01:18:19,035 --> 01:18:22,563
The echo still lingers
in these walls.

533
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:28,489
It felt like it was his statue
that was being erected!

534
01:18:29,325 --> 01:18:31,815
Did the people express their
bottled-up feelings?

535
01:18:35,932 --> 01:18:38,062
Or did they see someone?

536
01:18:39,174 --> 01:18:40,781
No! Impossible!

537
01:18:42,297 --> 01:18:44,624
Let us question the soldiers on duty...

538
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:45,948
as to who uttered the name
and why they did so!

539
01:18:46,141 --> 01:18:47,146
Then the truth will come out,
grandfather.

540
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:27,467
What are you doing here?

541
01:19:27,623 --> 01:19:29,392
L.. - The king has ordered us
to come. Let us go.

542
01:19:41,717 --> 01:19:45,168
Who first uttered the
name of Baahubali in the crowd?

543
01:19:49,845 --> 01:19:52,412
Am I talking to these walls?

544
01:19:52,608 --> 01:19:55,731
Speak! Or I will have
your tongues cut!

545
01:19:56,332 --> 01:20:00,144
I didn't see who, My Lord!
- Stop it!

546
01:20:02,177 --> 01:20:04,547
Bunch of idiots as you are!
Didn't anyone of you see him?

547
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:06,105
I saw him, My Lord!

548
01:20:50,906 --> 01:20:55,198
I have seen those eyes before!

549
01:20:56,352 --> 01:21:00,284
Bhadra! I want him alive.
- Let us go!

550
01:21:14,049 --> 01:21:15,611
Hey, who are you?

551
01:21:31,627 --> 01:21:33,156
He is here! Catch him.

552
01:21:43,519 --> 01:21:44,884
Catch him..

553
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:09,472
That way..

554
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:05,604
Sound the alarm!

555
01:23:22,057 --> 01:23:23,542
I have come to rescue you.

556
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,991
Kattappa, a marauder
has entered the palace

557
01:23:28,223 --> 01:23:29,752
and he set fire
to the King's chambers!

558
01:23:29,905 --> 01:23:31,347
You head north.

559
01:23:49,004 --> 01:23:52,008
Kattappa, Chop off his legs and hands
but I want him alive.

560
01:23:52,208 --> 01:23:54,774
As you say, My Prince!
- I want him alive!

561
01:23:57,533 --> 01:23:58,658
Come on!

562
01:24:06,301 --> 01:24:07,590
The alarm!

563
01:25:14,089 --> 01:25:15,291
Attack!

564
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:16,920
Get up!

565
01:26:19,154 --> 01:26:21,043
You lousy old hag!

566
01:26:23,318 --> 01:26:25,044
All these years of punishment...

567
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,882
for your infidelity
and still no shame!

568
01:26:29,324 --> 01:26:33,169
The moment you see a man,
you take off with him!

569
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:40,159
Kattappa! He is going to kill me!
He is going lo kill me!

570
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:41,677
My Prince!

571
01:27:41,796 --> 01:27:44,002
It is my duty to protect you!

572
01:27:46,401 --> 01:27:48,804
To get to you,

573
01:27:51,046 --> 01:27:52,531
he has to go through me first!

574
01:28:57,192 --> 01:28:58,360
Kattappa!

575
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:00,802
Kattappa!

576
01:29:11,286 --> 01:29:12,411
Devasena!

577
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:16,531
Attack!

578
01:29:16,691 --> 01:29:19,138
They are going for Devasena.
Stop them.

579
01:29:19,253 --> 01:29:20,860
Hail Mahishmati!

580
01:29:51,606 --> 01:29:52,852
Shiva!

581
01:29:58,013 --> 01:29:59,302
Siddha!

582
01:30:11,226 --> 01:30:14,317
"Mahasena!"

583
01:30:17,792 --> 01:30:20,676
"Mahasena!"

584
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:28,087
"Mahasena!"

585
01:31:24,659 --> 01:31:26,024
Anila!

586
01:32:08,063 --> 01:32:11,908
Baahubali!

587
01:33:33,348 --> 01:33:35,916
You resurrected our lost hope.

588
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:37,552
You made a great
warrior out of him

589
01:33:37,712 --> 01:33:38,793
and brought him back to us.

590
01:33:38,954 --> 01:33:43,924
Kingdom of Mahishmati will be
eternally grateful to you.

591
01:34:00,896 --> 01:34:02,665
My mother looks at me

592
01:34:03,498 --> 01:34:05,541
with this sadness and
not the usual affection.

593
01:34:09,024 --> 01:34:10,586
I don't know
who they are...

594
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:12,395
and yet they look at me like
lam their God!

595
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:16,953
And when I see the wounds
that tester on that lady...

596
01:34:17,432 --> 01:34:19,233
I have never met before,

597
01:34:20,835 --> 01:34:24,965
my blood boils and
my soul hurts! Why?

598
01:34:26,321 --> 01:34:27,523
Who am I?

599
01:34:28,843 --> 01:34:33,376
You are the son of our savior
Amarendra Baahubali.

600
01:34:34,729 --> 01:34:37,416
You are the balm
for your mother Devasena

601
01:34:37,612 --> 01:34:39,261
who awaited your return
for 25 years.

602
01:34:41,055 --> 01:34:42,661
You are the fruit of our

603
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:46,350
Queen Mother Sivagami's
ultimate sacrifice.

604
01:34:46,741 --> 01:34:50,192
The story you need to know
began 50 years ago, my son.

605
01:34:50,425 --> 01:34:52,588
This kingdom of Mahishmati
was established

606
01:34:52,747 --> 01:34:55,598
by your grandfather
Maharaja Vikramadeva.

607
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:58,557
Though eider,
Bijjaiadeva was not crowned

608
01:34:58,673 --> 01:35:00,595
because of his conniving nature.

609
01:35:00,755 --> 01:35:05,802
But Bijjaiadeva blamed it only
on his physical disabilities

610
01:35:06,241 --> 01:35:09,212
and it caused
great turmoil in him.

611
01:35:10,605 --> 01:35:14,013
The King died.

612
01:35:14,569 --> 01:35:17,540
He was survived by his subjects

613
01:35:17,692 --> 01:35:20,739
and the queen
who was six months pregnant.

614
01:35:20,895 --> 01:35:24,500
Three months passed by and
Mahishmati continued to mourn.

615
01:35:24,739 --> 01:35:28,070
The King's sister-in-law
and Bijjaladeva's wife, Sivagami

616
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:31,708
took up the reins of the kingdom.

617
01:35:32,787 --> 01:35:34,196
Being an astute woman

618
01:35:34,308 --> 01:35:36,110
she focused on
the welfare of the people

619
01:35:36,271 --> 01:35:38,313
and defense
of the kingdom.

620
01:35:39,434 --> 01:35:42,164
She could hear
the howls of the jackals

621
01:35:42,316 --> 01:35:44,643
making their move
towards the throne.

622
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:51,050
It was a dark new moon night.
The queen was in labour.

623
01:35:57,853 --> 01:35:59,895
We could not save the queen,
My Lady!

624
01:36:04,739 --> 01:36:05,908
It is a boy!

625
01:36:30,324 --> 01:36:31,449
Baahubali!

626
01:36:37,051 --> 01:36:41,300
The empty throne reminds
me of a widow's forehead.

627
01:36:41,456 --> 01:36:44,580
So, I will take the throne and
restore it to its former glory!

628
01:36:44,699 --> 01:36:46,469
Hail him!

629
01:36:46,701 --> 01:36:50,546
You all swore a solemn oath
to be loyal to this throne.

630
01:36:50,705 --> 01:36:53,031
A revolt at a time
when the kingdom mourns

631
01:36:53,228 --> 01:36:55,871
goes against every tenet
of being a Kshatriya, Marthanda!

632
01:36:56,071 --> 01:36:57,720
Being a leader
is the first tenet

633
01:36:57,873 --> 01:36:59,554
of being a Kshatriya,
Minister.

634
01:37:09,404 --> 01:37:10,813
Lady Sivagami?

635
01:37:30,184 --> 01:37:34,072
All those who support this
royal family step to one side.

636
01:37:34,749 --> 01:37:36,999
Who will support a woman,
Sivagami?

637
01:37:47,682 --> 01:37:49,004
Kattappa!

638
01:37:52,967 --> 01:37:55,894
They have soiled Mahishmati
with their revolt.

639
01:37:56,611 --> 01:37:58,413
Wash it off with their blood!

640
01:38:07,141 --> 01:38:08,431
How can you stand and watch...

641
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:10,068
while our people
are being hacked to death?

642
01:38:12,747 --> 01:38:16,635
Move! Kill that
slave and Sivagami!

643
01:38:17,952 --> 01:38:19,798
Kill Kattappa!

644
01:38:37,451 --> 01:38:41,503
You bribed and bought my people!
How conniving!

645
01:38:44,659 --> 01:38:48,591
Not conniving, Marthanda.
It is called the statecraft!

646
01:39:03,598 --> 01:39:06,328
Lady, you are a born
statesman and a warrior

647
01:39:06,481 --> 01:39:07,966
and we had the privilege to witness it.

648
01:39:08,082 --> 01:39:11,567
Please ascend the throne
and rule Mahishmati!

649
01:39:11,726 --> 01:39:14,773
No, Minister.
That is not my place.

650
01:39:14,929 --> 01:39:18,292
Then whose is it? 0!Lady!
- What kind of a question is that, minister?

651
01:39:18,413 --> 01:39:22,826
It belongs to my son,
Bhallaladeva.

652
01:39:23,017 --> 01:39:24,382
Tell him, Sivagami!

653
01:39:43,838 --> 01:39:47,771
Both my sons have
a right to the throne.

654
01:39:48,363 --> 01:39:53,934
The one with more valour,
compassion and wisdom

655
01:39:54,048 --> 01:39:55,937
will be crowned
the king of Mahishmati.

656
01:39:57,771 --> 01:40:00,863
This is my word
and my word is the law!

657
01:40:05,459 --> 01:40:10,259
"You found in her
an ocean of affection."

658
01:40:16,831 --> 01:40:21,630
"May you live long,
my dear Baahubali."

659
01:40:36,771 --> 01:40:41,905
"Ambrosia and venom."

660
01:40:43,618 --> 01:40:50,673
"Mind is where
they both get churned."

661
01:41:02,437 --> 01:41:06,249
"The scion of Mahishmathi"

662
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:10,813
"the heir to the throne
the only one.. Baahubali."

663
01:41:13,848 --> 01:41:17,660
"He roars like a lion in the
battlefield." - Rest for now.

664
01:41:17,892 --> 01:41:21,224
"He is nothing,
but a thunderstorm."

665
01:41:28,262 --> 01:41:30,348
Kattappa! lam very hungry.

666
01:41:30,505 --> 01:41:31,914
Can I have some?

667
01:41:32,066 --> 01:41:33,268
My Prince!

668
01:41:34,028 --> 01:41:36,038
Why are you standing?
Please sit down.

669
01:41:38,552 --> 01:41:39,842
Now give me some.

670
01:41:40,834 --> 01:41:43,445
My Prince!, your mere
presence here is wrong.

671
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:45,486
And then to sit with us
to break bread?

672
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,803
I am hungry.
Your lectures won't help me.

673
01:41:49,604 --> 01:41:50,926
There is a spread
of delicacies ready

674
01:41:51,085 --> 01:41:52,287
for you in your
royal chambers.

675
01:41:52,487 --> 01:41:54,977
I know. What is wrong
with this food?

676
01:41:55,129 --> 01:41:57,095
Just the aroma is
making my mouth water.

677
01:41:57,251 --> 01:41:59,458
You know what is wrong,
My Prince.

678
01:41:59,574 --> 01:42:02,500
You are royalty
and we are slaves.

679
01:42:02,657 --> 01:42:06,021
Alright! As the Prince
of Mahishmathi, I command you.

680
01:42:08,582 --> 01:42:09,750
Feed me, uncle.

681
01:42:43,938 --> 01:42:46,101
"Now has risen the sword
that will condemn."

682
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:48,391
"Now flies the arrow
that will pierce."

683
01:42:48,542 --> 01:42:50,628
"His enemies remain astonished."

684
01:42:50,785 --> 01:42:57,394
"They don't know where
to run or hide."

685
01:43:27,622 --> 01:43:28,824
Bhallaladeva!

686
01:43:39,874 --> 01:43:41,283
Great Bhalla!

687
01:43:42,316 --> 01:43:45,168
When I become the King,
you will be my commander!

688
01:44:07,982 --> 01:44:09,993
Both the princes
have excelled

689
01:44:10,144 --> 01:44:11,553
in their training as
warriors and scholars.

690
01:44:11,705 --> 01:44:13,431
They stand as equals.

691
01:44:13,667 --> 01:44:18,834
How are you going to decide who
will be crowned, Queen Mother?

692
01:44:20,835 --> 01:44:23,762
God has blessed both my
children with equal strengths.

693
01:44:23,918 --> 01:44:25,840
Now he is testing me

694
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:29,565
with the difficult decision
I have to make!

695
01:44:29,684 --> 01:44:33,289
Make their next challenges
much more difficult.

696
01:44:44,818 --> 01:44:47,625
Before she could decide
on who wit! ascend the throne

697
01:44:47,821 --> 01:44:50,672
the Queen Mother was
faced with a new crisis.

698
01:44:50,825 --> 01:44:53,917
the form of one
of their trusted Saketa.

699
01:44:56,591 --> 01:45:00,403
Saketa killed the guards
and stole our military secrets.

700
01:45:02,676 --> 01:45:04,959
Call for the Princes!
- As you wish.

701
01:45:05,559 --> 01:45:08,049
The young Princes searched

702
01:45:08,202 --> 01:45:10,932
for the traitor
in neighbouring kingdoms.

703
01:45:11,085 --> 01:45:13,488
Finally they found out
that he was hiding

704
01:45:13,688 --> 01:45:15,534
in a den of thieves
catted Singapuram.

705
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:17,015
It is a lawless place
where bandits

706
01:45:17,211 --> 01:45:18,379
thieves and murderers
gathered and mingled.

707
01:45:18,533 --> 01:45:20,783
Strangers who drew
attention to themselves

708
01:45:20,935 --> 01:45:23,938
were in mortal danger.

709
01:45:33,187 --> 01:45:35,874
I have never seen you before.
- I just got here.

710
01:45:36,030 --> 01:45:38,160
A hidden dagger! What is it for?

711
01:45:38,352 --> 01:45:39,641
Are you a spy?

712
01:45:45,879 --> 01:45:48,042
If our guards were this good..

713
01:45:48,203 --> 01:45:49,328
We wouldn't have
had the opportunity

714
01:45:49,483 --> 01:45:50,925
to see so many
different Kingdoms.

715
01:45:53,447 --> 01:45:55,053
Swords or smarts?

716
01:45:55,209 --> 01:45:56,651
Whichever is sharper.

717
01:46:04,338 --> 01:46:05,627
Do you have a drink?

718
01:46:12,747 --> 01:46:13,828
Big one?

719
01:46:22,997 --> 01:46:24,242
Much bigger?

720
01:46:31,565 --> 01:46:32,768
Do you have money?

721
01:46:41,456 --> 01:46:44,427
I need something large enough
for all my brothers!

722
01:47:03,316 --> 01:47:05,206
Look what is happening there..

723
01:47:05,319 --> 01:47:06,444
Come on!

724
01:47:11,085 --> 01:47:14,012
Not just booze.
There is a lot more here.

725
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:41,960
"Intoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

726
01:47:42,876 --> 01:47:47,726
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

727
01:47:48,642 --> 01:47:54,213
"Let your lips find mine."

728
01:47:54,408 --> 01:47:59,902
"Come and steal
myself from me."

729
01:48:00,134 --> 01:48:04,426
"You are the charming one."

730
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:10,473
"You are the charming one."

731
01:48:11,705 --> 01:48:14,436
"Your words are as
intoxicating as a bunch"

732
01:48:14,588 --> 01:48:17,318
"of ripe grapes
soaked in honey."

733
01:48:17,432 --> 01:48:22,686
"You know way to my heart,
you are the key to my soul."

734
01:48:23,197 --> 01:48:25,720
"Let me drink
this love potion."

735
01:48:25,839 --> 01:48:28,811
"You are mine, just mine."

736
01:48:28,963 --> 01:48:33,736
"intoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

737
01:48:34,729 --> 01:48:40,223
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

738
01:49:15,049 --> 01:49:20,500
"Take me in your strong arms,
I want to live."

739
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:31,947
"You got the magic,
no one has."

740
01:49:38,071 --> 01:49:43,686
"You are something
I want to lose myself in."

741
01:49:43,837 --> 01:49:49,571
"I want to be your
and make you mine, too."

742
01:49:50,003 --> 01:49:53,531
"Come and enjoy me."

743
01:49:55,249 --> 01:49:59,454
"You are the charming one."

744
01:49:59,573 --> 01:50:00,818
"Yes, I am."

745
01:50:00,974 --> 01:50:05,780
"You are the charming one."

746
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:09,630
"Don't shoot me
with love daggers."

747
01:50:09,783 --> 01:50:12,033
"Please listen to me, my love."

748
01:50:12,707 --> 01:50:15,394
"Let me drink
this love potion."

749
01:50:15,389 --> 01:50:18,393
"You are mine, just mine."

750
01:50:18,392 --> 01:50:23,678
"intoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

751
01:50:24,157 --> 01:50:29,444
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

752
01:51:34,628 --> 01:51:37,599
Instead of being
tortured by you, I should..

753
01:51:37,751 --> 01:51:38,799
Bhalla!

754
01:52:10,704 --> 01:52:12,473
Kattappaâ€œ

755
01:52:41,415 --> 01:52:44,900
Who did you sell our secrets to?
Tell me!

756
01:52:45,379 --> 01:52:46,821
Kalakeya!

757
01:52:50,544 --> 01:52:52,794
The Kalakeyas don't believe
in tactical attack.

758
01:52:53,347 --> 01:52:55,794
There is no limit
to their morbidity.

759
01:52:56,911 --> 01:52:59,073
If they barge into the kingdom

760
01:53:00,033 --> 01:53:02,316
they will kill every
innocent child

761
01:53:03,517 --> 01:53:06,488
and violate every woman.

762
01:53:07,642 --> 01:53:10,208
They will destroy
and burn everything.

763
01:53:11,285 --> 01:53:14,015
This talk might scare
some small kingdoms.

764
01:53:14,368 --> 01:53:16,094
We have a standing
army of 25,000 soldiers.

765
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:17,535
Why should we be scared?

766
01:53:18,172 --> 01:53:22,104
How big is the Kalakeya army?
- One hundred thousand.

767
01:53:57,291 --> 01:53:59,377
When wild bulls barge into the crops

768
01:53:59,573 --> 01:54:04,182
and lands that the Kalakeyas
plunder, are both left barren.

769
01:54:12,746 --> 01:54:15,148
We have to defend our kingdom

770
01:54:15,870 --> 01:54:17,913
and we have to attack our
enemies at the same time.

771
01:54:18,392 --> 01:54:20,554
What military strategy
should we use to attack?

772
01:54:21,395 --> 01:54:22,716
"The trident strategy".

773
01:54:26,199 --> 01:54:30,688
It is one for the textbooks.
No one has ever used it.

774
01:54:30,884 --> 01:54:33,167
You want to go to war
with something untested?

775
01:54:33,326 --> 01:54:34,888
If no one has used it

776
01:54:35,089 --> 01:54:37,175
the Kalakeyas wouldn't
expect it either.

777
01:54:37,331 --> 01:54:39,460
That is why
we should implement it.

778
01:54:39,613 --> 01:54:42,737
I second the plan.
- I approve it.

779
01:54:43,817 --> 01:54:47,422
It is the only way
into our kingdom.

780
01:54:47,581 --> 01:54:52,715
Kattappa, how big a force
do you need to stop them?

781
01:54:53,226 --> 01:54:54,832
Five thousand, Your Highness!

782
01:54:55,509 --> 01:54:59,518
I will use armour and spears
to erect a wall of iron.

783
01:54:59,633 --> 01:55:02,156
I will turn it into an
impregnable fortress.

784
01:55:04,038 --> 01:55:06,725
I will command the forces
to the north.

785
01:55:09,282 --> 01:55:11,772
I will take responsibility
for the south.

786
01:55:13,967 --> 01:55:15,376
According to our sources,

787
01:55:15,529 --> 01:55:17,779
the Kalakeya chief
will stand back

788
01:55:17,931 --> 01:55:20,181
and send half
his army forward.

789
01:55:20,935 --> 01:55:23,742
Our military formation
and our weapons...

790
01:55:24,137 --> 01:55:27,229
will repel that kind
of attack for three hours.

791
01:55:27,661 --> 01:55:32,030
But we have to kill
the chief during that time.

792
01:55:32,186 --> 01:55:35,354
Their army,
without a chief, will scatter!

793
01:55:35,549 --> 01:55:37,952
In the middle of that battle

794
01:55:38,071 --> 01:55:40,234
both princes with
their cavalry

795
01:55:40,394 --> 01:55:43,124
will attack the Chief
from two sides.

796
01:55:43,277 --> 01:55:46,204
It will take them
at least three hours

797
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:48,810
by the time they launch
a counter attack on us.

798
01:55:49,002 --> 01:55:51,373
That will be enough, mother.
Victory will be ours.

799
01:55:51,525 --> 01:55:55,097
Half that time will be enough
to behead him.

800
01:55:55,249 --> 01:55:58,220
Great! This will also
solve the conundrum

801
01:55:58,372 --> 01:56:00,415
of who should be the king.

802
01:56:02,576 --> 01:56:05,306
Yes! The one who kills
the Kalakeya chief

803
01:56:05,458 --> 01:56:07,589
will ascend the
throne of Mahishmathi!

804
01:56:09,302 --> 01:56:11,913
My Lord has
the perfect solution. - Yes.

805
01:56:15,029 --> 01:56:18,437
Divide the rest of the army
equally between the Princes!

806
01:56:20,434 --> 01:56:22,203
Bhalla, Baahu.

807
01:56:22,756 --> 01:56:25,683
This is the opportunity to
pay tribute to your motherland!

808
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:27,404
Accept it.

809
01:56:28,722 --> 01:56:31,486
Hail Mahishmati!
- Hail Mahishmati!

810
01:56:35,449 --> 01:56:38,300
Your uncle has
treated you unfairly.

811
01:56:38,452 --> 01:56:42,460
He has only given you
tools to breach a fort.

812
01:56:42,896 --> 01:56:45,748
Of what use will those
be in an open battlefield?

813
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:48,750
The arrow-machines
and the swords' chariot,

814
01:56:48,902 --> 01:56:50,792
all went to Bhallaladeva!

815
01:56:52,826 --> 01:56:54,869
You should have objected, Baahu!

816
01:56:58,272 --> 01:57:00,795
Your son shall ascend
the throne of Mahishmathi.

817
01:57:01,275 --> 01:57:04,278
You brilliantly hoodwinked
Baahubali! - What hoodwink?

818
01:57:04,758 --> 01:57:08,810
If he can't even demand the
right army, the right weapons

819
01:57:09,643 --> 01:57:11,893
what is he going to do
on the battlefield tomorrow?

820
01:57:13,406 --> 01:57:15,612
I made the strong one
even stronger.

821
01:57:16,370 --> 01:57:19,461
It is not cheating,
it is statecraft!

822
01:57:20,213 --> 01:57:22,704
Hey! Who is it?
- Forgive me, My Lord!

823
01:57:22,855 --> 01:57:24,221
The younger Prince
asked us to pull out

824
01:57:24,417 --> 01:57:25,902
the tents and
bring them to him.

825
01:58:31,605 --> 01:58:34,696
Welcome, Bhallaladeva!

826
01:59:01,675 --> 01:59:07,322
Invincible!
- Invincible!

827
01:59:08,001 --> 01:59:10,087
Welcome, Baahubali!

828
01:59:14,928 --> 01:59:24,344
Baahubali! Baahubali!

829
01:59:24,538 --> 01:59:26,548
Baahubali! Baahubali!

830
01:59:40,634 --> 01:59:43,561
Bahu, it is
a time-honoured ritual.

831
01:59:43,677 --> 01:59:44,518
If you don't
sacrifice the animal

832
01:59:44,677 --> 01:59:46,688
the soldiers will read it as a bad omen.
- Yes, My Prince!

833
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:48,883
If you don't offer the sacrifice

834
01:59:49,042 --> 01:59:50,288
the Goddess will be angry.

835
01:59:50,443 --> 01:59:52,092
Why quench the
Goddess's thirst with

836
01:59:52,245 --> 01:59:53,894
the blood of
this innocent animal

837
01:59:54,248 --> 01:59:56,574
when my own blood
can be offered?

838
01:59:59,212 --> 02:00:01,659
Hail Mahishmati!
- Hail Mahishmati!

839
02:00:01,815 --> 02:00:05,223
Hail Mahishmathi!
Hail Mahishmathi!

840
02:00:05,338 --> 02:00:07,544
Hail Mahishmathi!

841
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:09,750
Hail Mahishmathi!

842
02:00:12,145 --> 02:00:13,226
Hail Mahishmathi!

843
02:00:20,834 --> 02:00:22,920
Mahishmathi will be
forgiving and benevolent!

844
02:00:25,478 --> 02:00:26,888
This is your last chance.

845
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:30,251
Drop your weapons and run
and we will spare your lives.

846
02:00:44,697 --> 02:00:46,587
I heard that you promised
both your sons that

847
02:00:46,739 --> 02:00:49,187
the one who kills me
would be made king.

848
02:00:54,427 --> 02:00:57,037
And if both of them
die at my hands?

849
02:01:13,687 --> 02:01:16,253
I will conquer you
and your kingdom

850
02:01:16,409 --> 02:01:17,611
and then I will have
a son with you.

851
02:01:17,771 --> 02:01:19,300
You can make him the king!

852
02:01:27,861 --> 02:01:29,423
I want him alive.

853
02:01:30,423 --> 02:01:33,591
I want him to be alive
even after his arms and legs

854
02:01:33,747 --> 02:01:36,237
are cut off and he
lies in a pool of blood!

855
02:01:42,875 --> 02:01:47,528
When the vultures pluck out
his eyes and feast on his guts.

856
02:01:48,202 --> 02:01:50,091
He should be alive.

857
02:01:51,485 --> 02:01:53,254
Kattappa!
' My Lady!

858
02:01:53,407 --> 02:01:55,417
Blow the conch
to begin the battle.

859
02:02:25,358 --> 02:02:26,560
It is ready.

860
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:27,604
Arm the weapon.

861
02:02:33,166 --> 02:02:34,334
Fire!

862
02:02:40,013 --> 02:02:41,498
Baahubali's command'.!

863
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,005
Get ready!

864
02:03:10,323 --> 02:03:12,092
Arm the weapons.

865
02:04:16,389 --> 02:04:17,470
Attack!

866
02:05:14,046 --> 02:05:16,089
Attack!

867
02:06:52,745 --> 02:06:55,432
Well done, Baahubali!
- Well done.

868
02:07:23,696 --> 02:07:25,586
Soldiers. Attack.

869
02:07:25,738 --> 02:07:27,224
Attack!

870
02:07:45,638 --> 02:07:48,161
Hold! Hold strong!

871
02:08:03,656 --> 02:08:05,426
Swords group, step forward!

872
02:10:04,617 --> 02:10:06,747
Trident strategy begins!

873
02:12:29,922 --> 02:12:31,211
Stop-

874
02:12:37,130 --> 02:12:38,298
Bhallaladeva!

875
02:12:43,816 --> 02:12:45,018
My Prince?

876
02:12:55,948 --> 02:12:57,794
My Prince!
- Army!

877
02:14:26,038 --> 02:14:28,922
Hold your lines!

878
02:14:36,409 --> 02:14:39,139
Hold your lines! Hold them!

879
02:15:21,414 --> 02:15:23,303
Our defenses are in tatters.

880
02:15:23,695 --> 02:15:25,782
We are seeing an enemy
flag on Mahishmati soil...

881
02:15:25,938 --> 02:15:26,899
for the first time!

882
02:15:27,060 --> 02:15:29,385
This is the death of us. Death!

883
02:15:29,942 --> 02:15:32,465
Death! Death!

884
02:16:20,913 --> 02:16:22,114
Death!

885
02:16:25,237 --> 02:16:26,646
Death!

886
02:16:29,922 --> 02:16:31,244
Soldiers!

887
02:16:38,811 --> 02:16:40,296
What is death?

888
02:16:41,895 --> 02:16:44,145
To think that the
enemy is stronger

889
02:16:44,296 --> 02:16:45,858
than our resolve, is death!

890
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:51,865
Cowardice on the battlefield
is death!

891
02:16:53,706 --> 02:16:57,998
The cruel man insulted our
mother and he is still alive.

892
02:16:59,792 --> 02:17:02,795
Instead of presenting his
decapitated head at her feet

893
02:17:02,955 --> 02:17:05,205
we are turning our backs
to him and that is death!

894
02:17:10,002 --> 02:17:12,974
I will ride on to annihilate
that death!

895
02:17:14,046 --> 02:17:17,978
No rogue can ever harm
my mother or my motherland.

896
02:17:18,210 --> 02:17:22,219
I am about to rip them apart
and proclaim my war cry!

897
02:17:27,419 --> 02:17:29,430
Who is with me?

898
02:17:31,383 --> 02:17:32,673
Me!

899
02:17:32,825 --> 02:17:35,556
Who will die with me?
- Me!

900
02:17:35,788 --> 02:17:40,354
Who will vanquish that
death and live on? - Me!

901
02:17:41,994 --> 02:17:43,239
Me!

902
02:17:43,396 --> 02:17:47,765
Hail Mahishmathi!

903
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:52,005
Hail Mahishmathi!

904
02:18:02,174 --> 02:18:03,736
Hail Mahishmathi!

905
02:18:05,257 --> 02:18:08,621
Hail Mahishmathi!

906
02:18:34,046 --> 02:18:35,215
Sethupathy!

907
02:23:15,567 --> 02:23:17,730
I want him alive when
the vultures pluck out his eyes

908
02:23:17,890 --> 02:23:20,292
and feast on his guts.

909
02:23:21,093 --> 02:23:25,582
His limbs are to be cut off
and his blood should flow!

910
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:50,285
My Son!

911
02:23:51,883 --> 02:23:54,767
Bhallaladeva! Bhallaladeva!

912
02:24:16,948 --> 02:24:18,271
My Son!

913
02:24:18,990 --> 02:24:25,086
My brave son killed
Kalakeya and won the battle!

914
02:24:30,162 --> 02:24:34,007
To the future king,
Bhallaladeva!

915
02:24:34,165 --> 02:24:37,333
Hail Bhallaladeva!
Hail Bhallaladeva!

916
02:24:38,811 --> 02:24:41,061
Bhallaladeva's valour
will be told in Mahishmati

917
02:24:41,213 --> 02:24:43,223
for generations to come!

918
02:24:43,815 --> 02:24:49,222
Tales of his victory will be
etched on shrines and temples.

919
02:24:49,741 --> 02:24:51,991
Today, I proclaim
my son Bhallaladeva

920
02:24:52,144 --> 02:24:55,354
as the commander of the
armed forces of Mahishmathi!

921
02:24:58,630 --> 02:25:02,442
I proclaim Baahubali
as the King of Mahishmathi!

922
02:25:10,763 --> 02:25:13,931
Sivagami,
What sort of a decision is this?

923
02:25:14,086 --> 02:25:18,859
My son, our son,
killed the Kalakeya chief!

924
02:25:19,011 --> 02:25:21,217
You saw it with your own eyes!

925
02:25:22,054 --> 02:25:25,418
He has to be the King! Only he!

926
02:25:25,897 --> 02:25:28,104
The merits of a King
are evaluated not

927
02:25:28,260 --> 02:25:29,985
by the number
of enemies he has killed

928
02:25:30,142 --> 02:25:32,545
but by the number of
his own people he has saved.

929
02:25:33,064 --> 02:25:33,992
During the battle

930
02:25:34,146 --> 02:25:36,996
Bhallaladeva's focus was
only in vanquishing the enemy.

931
02:25:37,188 --> 02:25:40,072
Baahubali,
while killing the enemy

932
02:25:40,271 --> 02:25:42,642
also managed
to save his subjects.

933
02:25:43,596 --> 02:25:46,359
That is the difference
between a soldier and a king.

934
02:25:48,521 --> 02:25:51,884
If you kill a hundred men you will
be called a great warrior.

935
02:25:52,484 --> 02:25:56,688
But if you save one life,
you will be called God!

936
02:26:00,251 --> 02:26:01,813
So, saving a couple
of common men

937
02:26:01,974 --> 02:26:03,383
is now the
qualification to rule?

938
02:26:03,495 --> 02:26:05,778
Baahubali will be
crowned the King of

939
02:26:05,938 --> 02:26:07,947
Mahishmati on
an auspicious day.

940
02:26:08,940 --> 02:26:12,271
That is my word
and my word is law!

941
02:26:16,388 --> 02:26:18,714
Baahubali! Baahubali!

942
02:26:19,271 --> 02:26:23,924
Baahubali! Baahubali!

943
02:26:24,115 --> 02:26:26,004
Baahubali! Baahubali!

944
02:26:26,158 --> 02:26:30,287
Baahubali!
- Baahubali!

945
02:26:30,441 --> 02:26:35,608
Baahubali! Baahubali!

946
02:26:45,737 --> 02:26:47,900
Amarendra Baahubali!

947
02:26:49,021 --> 02:26:52,472
Glory to him!

948
02:26:55,947 --> 02:26:59,071
Amarendra Baahubali!

949
02:26:59,631 --> 02:27:03,279
Glory to him!

950
02:27:03,475 --> 02:27:06,479
Glory to him!

951
02:27:08,680 --> 02:27:11,564
My Shiva is the son
of such a great king!

952
02:27:12,644 --> 02:27:15,211
We are so glad
to hear about him.

953
02:27:16,128 --> 02:27:19,252
I wish we can
see the great man once!

954
02:27:21,652 --> 02:27:23,062
He is no more.

955
02:27:24,655 --> 02:27:26,425
The saviour is no more!

956
02:27:33,385 --> 02:27:35,548
You said no enemy
could come near him.

957
02:27:36,027 --> 02:27:38,158
You said the weapons
were afraid to touch him?

958
02:27:39,671 --> 02:27:41,681
How did such
a great warrior die?

959
02:27:43,515 --> 02:27:46,879
More grievous than
the wound of a sword or a spear

960
02:27:47,759 --> 02:27:49,440
is a stab in the back, Mahendra.

961
02:27:49,882 --> 02:27:52,448
Who? Who was it?

962
02:27:55,606 --> 02:27:56,896
That traitor...

963
02:27:59,051 --> 02:28:00,219
was me!

964
02:28:16,748 --> 02:28:21,548
"Golden dreams
and great heartache."

965
02:28:30,001 --> 02:28:34,801
"churn in the depth of the soul
of this river called life."

966
02:28:41,093 --> 02:28:50,628
"When great mountains
lay in its path."

967
02:28:52,344 --> 02:28:57,144
"It cuts deep gorges through
the rock to keep flowing!"

968
02:29:04,355 --> 02:29:09,155
"This unstoppable, inexhaustible
river called life."

969
02:29:21,612 --> 02:29:27,860
"It is called
the river of life."
