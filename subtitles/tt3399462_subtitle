431
00:41:30,372 --> 00:41:33,170
Unlike other girls, instead of slapping hard, she went away silently...

432
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:36,710
said nothing means she has interest in my proposal

433
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:40,507

434
00:41:41,984 --> 00:41:44,111

Those moments when l proposed herwere rewinding in my mind

907
01:15:55,111 --> 01:15:56,908
the biggesttwist is my dad

908
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,408

909
01:16:00,951 --> 01:16:02,578

01:16:07,257 --> 01:16:10,090
his decisions are always correct

912
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:14,426
l always doubted my dad decisions, but he isthe ultimate

913
01:16:14,731 --> 01:16:17,529
itis a good family except for him

914
01:16:18,001 --> 01:16:19,491
she is a combination of sweet and sour

915
01:16:20,003 --> 01:16:23,530
l am unable to get a clarity on him

916
01:16:23,707 --> 01:16:27,700
will see how she doesnt love me

917
01:16:28,211 --> 01:16:31,476

out ofthe anger on me.

1249
01:38:28,597 --> 01:38:30,189
why will she be angry on you

1250
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,763
kiran you are willingto get married rite?

1251
01:38:33,835 --> 01:38:35,302
Thatisthe reason why
l have come from such a far distance..

you stand by yourwords,
even l like this marriage..

why should you like it?

1255
01:38:41,944 --> 01:38:43,104

Hello you dont change
the topic, its personal

01:38:52,788 --> 01:38:53,914
its personal it seems.

1261
01:38:54,356 --> 01:38:55,755
how can marriage be personal,

1262
01:38:56,224 --> 01:39:00,354
we shouldnt believe girls,they smile
out but hide lots of anger inside

1263
01:39:01,863 --> 01:39:04,696
l amtalking about girls, not you

1264
01:39:05,667 --> 01:39:08,693
what l amtryingto say is
hey karthik, how come you are here?

1265
01:39:08,770 --> 01:39:09,361
Actually Sheela,

1266

He istryingto spoil your marriage on
the basis of your relation with him

1270
01:39:22,718 --> 01:39:25,186
oh, it means, kiran has loved sheela

1271
01:39:25,253 --> 01:39:26,413
hey, karthik would never do that,

1272
01:39:26,655 --> 01:39:32,821
l have already informed kiran about
what happened between me and karthik

1273
01:39:34,262 --> 01:39:36,196
l am done now

1274
01:39:36,264 --> 01:39:38,892

1278
01:39:47,309 --> 01:39:51,405
lthought he has loved you and
between l havent dated sheela

1279
01:39:52,381 --> 01:39:54,975
eatthis chicken, its very tasty

1280
01:39:57,853 --> 01:39:58,979
why are behaving like this,

1281
01:39:59,054 --> 01:40:01,318
should have referred me aswould beithen
there would have been no confusion

1282
01:40:01,390 --> 01:40:02,322
why should l say?

1283
01:40:02,758 --> 01:40:04,453
What is your problem nandu?

1284
01:40:04,893 --> 01:40:07,157

01:40:10,098 --> 01:40:12,225
from day one l am observing
your manipulation,

1286
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,234
you care least about my feelings,

1287
01:40:14,302 --> 01:40:17,999
in spite oftellingthat l dont like you,
you have brought itthis far

1288
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:21,002
tell me one reason why you dont like me

1289
01:40:21,109 --> 01:40:22,872
tell me one reason why l should like you

1290
01:40:22,944 --> 01:40:24,935
love has no reasons, only emotions,

1291
01:40:25,013 --> 01:40:27,709
butto dontlike someone
we gotto have reasons

1292
01:40:27,783 --> 01:40:30,183
l have hundred but l dontfeel
the need of saying itto you

1293
01:40:30,252 --> 01:40:32,777
no needto say itto me,wish
at least you knowthem..

1294
01:40:33,755 --> 01:40:37,191
do l look like a dumb fool, its a waste oftime
to talk aboutthese reasons and logics,

1295

1304
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:26,038
riding on aelephant

1305
01:41:45,594 --> 01:41:47,323

1306
01:42:11,953 --> 01:42:16,856
He is my son in law, he is goingto marry
my sweet daughter and gonnatake care of her,

1307
01:42:16,925 --> 01:42:19,860
he isthe best giftwhich l could give to nandu

1308
01:42:22,164 --> 01:42:25,998
nandu is so lucky to be a daughter
for such a loving father like you

1309
01:42:26,401 --> 01:42:31,361
its not nandus luck, he is lucky enough
to have nandu as his daughter

1310
01:42:33,041 --> 01:42:35,032
so true, i am lucky

1311
01:42:35,977 --> 01:42:38,537
even inthis face book generation,
she has valued my words

1312
01:42:38,613 --> 01:42:43,380
and believes me so much that
she agreedto this marriage,

1313
01:42:43,451 --> 01:42:45,282

if your dad has selected one
out of2000,then he is definitely fit for you.

1317
01:42:59,634 --> 01:43:01,499
why did you switch off your phone

1318
01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:04,004
oh, friends have come
