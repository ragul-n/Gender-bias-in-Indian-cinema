1
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,040
Coffee?
- No.

2
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,240
Milk?

3
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,440
Ayan.

4
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,640
Hi, Ayan.
- Hi Ayan, How are you doing?

5
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
Hi, Hi guys.

6
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,800
Ayan, I just wanted
you to know that,

7
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,760
I really wanna produce
the movie version of your story.

8
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,600
But, you are asking us to
take a very powerful coperation.

9
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,040
I'm here with frank
our financier's lawyer.

10
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,640
And he just wants to make sure that

11
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,920
everything is safe for our backers.

12
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,600
Now, everything you say is true
and we can prove that it's true

13
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,120
then we can make this film.

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,320
Listen, Ayan,
we've just came back from pakistan

15
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,680
and there are some
things in our screenplay

16
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,160
that don't add up for us.

17
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,280
So we just need to make sure that,
we've got the full story.

18
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,760
You understand?
- Yes.

19
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,200
And we're gonna record this incase
we need it as evidence in court.

20
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,240
Nadeem, how do I turn this on?

21
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,720
You're the director.

22
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,360
So...

23
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,880
Ayan, where does your story start?

24
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,040
"Beloved..."

25
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,720
"Your love is beautiful."

26
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,640
"Beloved..."

27
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,640
"My heart flutters."

28
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,480
Do you like Bollywood movies?

29
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,200
Imran!

30
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,200
Congratulations buddy!

31
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,480
I wanted to come
but my boss is a real...

32
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,800
Don't worry.

33
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,600
Zainab.

34
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,400
Congratulations!

35
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,440
Can you turn the
TV around a little bit?

36
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,000
Here, take it.

37
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,680
I've seen it already.

38
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,240
Thank you.

39
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
'Enemy?'

40
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,760
'No, friend.'

41
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,040
'Good luck, good luck.'

42
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,920
'You call this good luck?'

43
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
'Yes.'

44
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,280
'Very soon something good
is going to happen to you...'

45
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,920
Yeah! Movie time.
- Sajid...

46
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,920
Sajid! You silly boy,
come out of there! Come on!

47
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,560
'Hey, good luck!'

48
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,160
Leave them alone.

49
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,280
It's not your room any more.

50
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,320
But Mum, they're watching a movie.

51
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,240
I'll tell your Dad!
- It's not fair.

52
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,560
Ayan, I'm sure it
was a lovely wedding,

53
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,680
but what we really need
to know is how you got the job.

54
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,800
If you want to understand my story,

55
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
you have to understand my life.

56
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,880
My family.

57
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,680
Before all of this began.

58
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,720
'I was a, a salesman for a local,'

59
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,040
Pakistani pharmacuetical company.'

60
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,560
'We used to sell drugs
to the doctors.'

61
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,160
'But the doctors had
no time for us.'

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,680
'The multinatinals were
the only ones they listened to.'

63
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,760
Doctor!

64
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,320
Why burden your patients with
the expensive multinational brands?

65
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,560
Why should they pay
for fancy packaging?

66
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,120
Here, is an antibiotic
manufactured in our country.

67
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,560
I know your products

68
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,200
but no one wants
to buy Pakistani drugs.

69
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
But they're the same

70
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,320
and a fifth of the price.

71
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,200
They're cheaper!

72
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,600
But people don't want to buy
them because they don't trust them.

73
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,720
What about the poor people?

74
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,280
When it comes to their health,

75
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,720
even they are ready to pay
the price for fancy packaging.

76
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,760
Let me leave you some free samples.

77
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,240
Your company might
have money to spare,

78
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,240
but I don't have time to waste.

79
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,160
Doctor, please listen to me.

80
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Ayan!

81
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,520
Yes, Happy-Ji.

82
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,040
Are you happy?

83
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,960
Yes, Happy-Ji.

84
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,680
Do you think I am happy?

85
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,920
You are...
- Do you think I am happy!

86
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,720
You will have your rent
by the end of the week.

87
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,520
In consideration of this case

88
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,720
we would like to state that,

89
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,160
the evidence provided
by the prosecution...

90
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,720
She types very well.

91
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,840
Dinner! Dinner is ready.

92
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,000
Eat, eat, eat...
All we do in this house is eat.

93
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,040
No problem I'll give your
share of dessert to the boys.

94
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,440
Okay.

95
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,760
How was your day?

96
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,480
Nobody wants to buy
local products any more...

97
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,320
I hope tomorrow will
be better than today!

98
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,800
God willing!
- God willing!

99
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Son.

100
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,040
Tomorrow when he goes

101
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,600
to the High Court
with his letter of protest

102
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,080
you go with him

103
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,600
and tell the Judge your
father didn't mean any offence.

104
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,720
Come on, sit down.
Sit, have dinner.

105
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,600
Come on. The food is served.
Come, now.

106
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,080
Move!
- Hurry up. The food is hot.

107
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,320
Eat fast.

108
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,440
Please don't rush us...

109
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,520
Chewing food is as
important as eating it.

110
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,160
So eat it now and save
the chewing for later!

111
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,560
Your father was a lawyer?

112
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,360
No, not officialy.

113
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,440
The government took away his job

114
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,200
and he taught himself
the law to try and win it back.

115
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,360
He loved the legal jargon.

116
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,280
Here you are.

117
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,840
Please take a look at this.

118
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,760
A big multinational
company is looking

119
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,920
for medical representatives.

120
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,000
They're looking
for college graduates.

121
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,840
Read.

122
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,160
Your mum told me,

123
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,520
when your father lost his job,
you left college

124
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
and started working.

125
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,920
Ayan!

126
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,880
Zainab I know these people,
they only want college graduates.

127
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,680
Ayan you are an excellent salesman,
you can sell anything.

128
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,760
Try. What do you have to lose?

129
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,120
Ayan!

130
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,880
Come here children...

131
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,080
Ok, I'll give it a shot.

132
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,000
But I know it's not going to work.

133
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,360
Here, try this one.

134
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,520
I had it made when I was your age.

135
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,480
It should fit you.

136
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
See?

137
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,720
Let me see.

138
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,760
Perfect fit!

139
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,320
You look good!

140
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,800
No.. no...
Take that off. It's all wrong.

141
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,080
It looks like your elder brother's!

142
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,360
Try this one.
- Yes try this one.

143
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,720
Ayan!

144
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,280
These shoes,

145
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,400
they're from Javed's wedding.

146
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,480
He only wore them once.

147
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,840
Try them on.

148
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,680
Now he looks like an executive
with a big multinational company.

149
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,200
Which company is it?

150
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,440
You'll find out soon enough.
- Take this, it's my favourite.

151
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,320
Try to speak in English
when you get there, okay?

152
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,560
Yes... that will impress them.

153
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,040
It's extremely hot!

154
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,080
Darn you!

155
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,760
They say it brings luck.

156
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,920
You must have been through a lot.

157
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
If you have to find your luck...

158
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,720
in bird shit!

159
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,200
Are you going to use
the real company name?

160
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Of course.

161
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,720
It would be helpful not to use ***.

162
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Well,

163
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,280
let's just assume that
we will not use the company name

164
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,880
we will see how it feels.

165
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,080
Okay.

166
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,440
Greetings!
- Greetings!

167
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,120
Are you here for me?
- Yes, sir.

168
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,040
How are you?
- I'm good. How are you? Hi!

169
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,840
Good morning Tigers.

170
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,560
That's what I'm going to call you.

171
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,360
That's what I want you to be.

172
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,960
Tigers.

173
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,680
Good morning Tiger Waleed.

174
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,680
Good morning sir.
- Tiger sir!

175
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,200
Good morning Tiger sir.

176
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,400
Good morning Tiger Ayan.

177
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,040
Good morning Tiger sir.

178
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,760
Growl Tigers.

179
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,480
I said growl!

180
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,520
That is a growl!

181
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,920
A real growl.

182
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,440
Let that growl that is inside you,
come out now.

183
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,040
I need you to give
me your best today.

184
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,320
Only a few of you

185
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,760
are going to make it to
become sales representatives.

186
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,600
You will be selling the
world's best infant formula

187
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,360
with the world's best company...
Lastavita.

188
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,320
So go get 'em.

189
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
What did they ask you?

190
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,080
It was all about "Who do I know?"

191
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,920
Doctors, hospitals, etc.

192
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
I thought they were just
looking for guys with diplomas.

193
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,720
Alright!

194
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,000
So you say you know
all the doctors here?

195
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,640
Yes sir, I spend my days
going from one doctor to another.

196
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,040
Really?

197
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,920
So how well do you know them?

198
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,400
I meet them every
day in all the hospitals.

199
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,360
So do you know them
or do you spend your time

200
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,720
waiting outside their offices?

201
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,000
I know them.

202
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,200
Alright.

203
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,680
So, what can you
tell me about Dr. Wasim?

204
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,160
Wasim...

205
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,800
Who works at the Civil hospital.

206
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,360
Wasim... He's a good doctor.
He has a lot of patients.

207
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,640
Yes. He's a good doctor.

208
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,080
Doctor Wasim works
at the Hassan hospital.

209
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,840
I'm sorry.
There's been a misunderstanding.

210
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,440
We're looking for
people with experience.

211
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,920
Sir...

212
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
2.0!
- Yes,

213
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,000
and then it went off to 2.8%.

214
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,560
Ali-Rasool Medical Store.

215
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,520
Ayub-Aalam Pharmacy.
- Excuse me!

216
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,040
Mustafa-Rashid Pharmacy.
Wasim...

217
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,320
Central Medical Supplies...
- So?

218
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,840
Which do you think is easier?

219
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,600
Working for you and just walking
into all the top doctors' offices

220
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,160
or travelling
hundreds of kilometers

221
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
around every two-bit pharmacy,

222
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,000
selling local products
no-one really wants?

223
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,520
I have to be ten times as good
as these guys to sell this stuff.

224
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,800
Lasta food inc!
This stuff sells itself.

225
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,800
If I can make a living
selling what I sell,

226
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,840
can you imagine what
I would do with your products?

227
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,080
If you don't hire me, you are a...
stupid man.

228
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,560
"Why do I keep wandering"

229
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,880
"around the world?"

230
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,080
Greetings uncle!
- Greetings!

231
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,160
Ayan, did you get the job?

232
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,760
Thanks for the jacket.

233
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,360
Greetings!
- Greetings!

234
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,760
What happened Ayan?
How come you're so late?

235
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,440
We were worried.

236
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,840
The interview didn't go well?

237
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:52,080
"The time has come to bow my head."
- He got the job.

238
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,080
"O my, Almighty!"
- You got it!

239
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,120
"O my, Almighty!" x
- You got the job!

240
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,920
"O my, Almighty!"
- He got the job!

241
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,040
Why are you shouting?
- He got a job with Lasta!

242
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,440
Wow! Ayan, you got the job.

243
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,120
"O my, Almighty!"

244
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,040
I told you, you're my lucky charm.

245
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,760
I always had faith in you.

246
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,200
I'm so happy you got the job.

247
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,560
What is your salary?

248
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
I forgot to ask...

249
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,800
Wow chocolates!
- Its Lasta. They will pay well.

250
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,400
Go away. These are not for you.

251
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,920
Mum let them take
some it's for them.

252
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,920
No, no. We need sweets
for people who come to visit us.

253
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,360
Oh, mom!

254
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,280
Here you go.

255
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,200
Ayan, you said the
advert in the newspaper

256
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,560
was for college graduates.

257
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,120
Yet you got the job, What happened?

258
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,800
I told you,

259
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,520
they were impressed
by how well I know my area.

260
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
But,

261
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,520
even I was surprised
when I got the job.

262
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,920
Thanks.

263
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,640
There is no proof that
he forged the diploma.

264
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,120
I know. That's exactly
what we're up against.

265
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,440
If they say he forged it,

266
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,920
we have to prove otherwise
that's how defirmaton law works:

267
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,920
guilty until proven innocent.

268
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,920
So they can make up anything
and we have to prove it's not true?

269
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,840
Yes, Yes, you do.

270
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,000
Okay.

271
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,040
Don't come inside, go away.

272
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,080
Thank you for the job sir.

273
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,040
I promise I'll work very hard.

274
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,760
You got the job.
Now let's see if you can keep it.

275
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,280
Raja!
- Yes.

276
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Come here!

277
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,440
So this is your base.

278
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,360
Anything you need,
you'll get it here.

279
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,560
Greetings!
- Greetings!

280
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,840
This is Ayan, the new medical
representative for South-East zone.

281
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,720
Welcome.
- Thank you sir.

282
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,720
Go, get the stuff for him.

283
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,760
He's not "sir" to you,
you are "sir" to him.

284
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,560
So this is what you'll be selling.

285
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,080
These are the keys

286
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,600
that will help you unlock
doors to meet doctors...

287
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,720
nurses and pharmacists.

288
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,800
You can even have
some for yourself.

289
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,240
For your relatives,
but close family only.

290
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,120
Sign here.

291
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,920
This is very important for you.

292
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,240
Imprest money! That's
what our accountants call it.

293
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,240
But I call it "impress money"

294
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,680
because we use
it to impress people.

295
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,160
Find out which doctors
have the most patients

296
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,320
befriend them and if need
be spend "impress money" on them.

297
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,800
But remember,

298
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,560
results should accompany
every expenditure.

299
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,240
Sure.

300
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,720
There are four classes of doctor.

301
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Doctor Saleem is triple A.

302
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,040
He has 300 newborns every month.

303
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,520
He has two kids,
and he likes football very much.

304
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,000
He is very religious.
Take good care of him.

305
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,280
Then double A class,
A class, and "just doctors."

306
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,920
"Just doctors" are a waste of time.

307
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,240
Sign up the triple
As and the double As.

308
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,800
Learn everything about them.
Everything means everything!

309
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,440
Befriend them and they
will recommend our products.

310
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,000
It's as simple as that.

311
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,160
Greetings! How are you?
- Greetings!

312
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,040
This one is young,
probably not many patients

313
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,160
and by the way he dresses
you can see he is greedy.

314
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,120
So don't waste your time on him.

315
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,440
Anyway, your job is to make
sure that every baby born here...

316
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,240
is a Lasta baby. Got it?

317
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,200
Farida!

318
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,600
Farida!

319
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,840
Take this.

320
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,560
You didn't have to!

321
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,560
Thanks for your kind gesture.

322
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,800
I'm sorry we kept your
son's shoes for so long!

323
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,680
Why are you talking like this?
Come in, let's have tea.

324
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,400
Oh Taslima, so many gifts?

325
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,920
You know how Ayan is.

326
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,400
Ayan said, "Please Mum,
give these to Aunty Farida."

327
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,240
"I don't care if there's
nothing left for us."

328
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,640
You are very lucky Taslima...

329
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,520
He is God's gift.

330
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,680
What are you doing?

331
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,280
The black boxes mean
those doctors are mine.

332
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,520
Ah, Dr. Nawaz is also mine.

333
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,240
Are you going to growl like this
every time you do this, Mr. Lion?

334
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,160
I'm a Tiger, actually.

335
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,560
Oh, I am sorry.

336
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,480
My mistake, I didn't realize
that was a tiger's growl.

337
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,080
Ayan...

338
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,720
Oh, no Ayan,
not that, please, not that.

339
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,000
Oh, no Ayan,
not that, please, not that.

340
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,200
Oh no Ayan, not that, please...
- Growl tigress, growl!

341
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,720
Ayan!

342
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,400
"Uselessly..."

343
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,000
"It is now you
who has mislead me, my beloved."

344
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,200
We should get our own place.

345
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,480
You don't even know
how much they're paying you

346
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,160
and we're already talking
about getting our own place?

347
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,920
I thought tigers only growled
when they have caught their prey.

348
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,400
Greetings!
- Greetings!

349
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,040
I am from Lasta.

350
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,280
I need some information.

351
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,920
Please speak to
the doctor directly.

352
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,880
I will, of course, but...

353
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,240
Oh, please have this. I know you
work hard all day and all night.

354
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,960
No, thank you.

355
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,040
Please. I get all this for free.

356
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,720
Okay, no problem.

357
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,280
Well... I guess...

358
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,200
I could share it
with my colleagues.

359
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,120
No... this is just for you.
I have more for them.

360
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,520
Thank you.

361
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,120
Your Dr.
Faiz sounds very interesting?

362
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,240
Yes... but don't try
to give him chocolates.

363
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,760
Not even for his birthday?

364
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,560
He doesn't celebrate his birthday.

365
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,040
You can give us his
share of chocolates.

366
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,480
I don't think he eats chocolates.

367
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,360
Would your magic bag happen
to have lipsticks in it too?

368
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,280
I can get some if you need them.

369
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,000
Really?
- Yes.

370
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,440
So tell me...
What does Dr. Faiz like?

371
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,120
What are you doing here?

372
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,760
I have an appointment with you.

373
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,200
Oh...

374
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,480
Looks like it's been
a tough day for you.

375
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,680
We can meet later.

376
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,080
No. It's alright.

377
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,280
In any case,
you are not the last one.

378
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,480
Okay...

379
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,920
Why don't you use these
10 minutes to relax.

380
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,080
Call home or read a paper.
Use these ten minutes as a break.

381
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,400
I'll sit here and check my notes.

382
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,880
Are you sure?

383
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,760
Yes, you guys are heroes,
you save lives...

384
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,240
This is the least I can do.

385
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,720
I forgot...

386
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,400
this is for you.

387
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,400
Please... keep it.

388
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,120
Thank you very much... can I...?

389
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,000
Sure. It's yours.

390
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,360
As a junior doctor
you're very vulnerable.

391
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,200
And it's very flattering,

392
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,680
when a medical reps
knows the music you like.

393
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,960
It's called investing in
people and before you know it,

394
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,960
you're trying to please them

395
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,600
by making sure your hospital
only stocks their products.

396
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,480
And when your hospital
only stocks their product,

397
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,480
then so do all the
surrounding pharmacies.

398
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,800
You have to ask yourself
are you a great guy

399
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,560
or are you so popular because
you have so many patients.

400
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,440
Faiz... I have the same poster.

401
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,440
Well, this is an original photo.

402
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
No!

403
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,360
Where did you get it?

404
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,160
How about a game now?

405
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,320
What? Now? How can I leave?

406
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,520
There are medical representatives
outside waiting for meetings.

407
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,960
Sahil!
- Howzzat?

408
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,320
The English are so boring.
They're playing for a draw.

409
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,600
How are my products selling?

410
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,480
Going well.

411
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,440
And what about the competition?

412
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,400
Seems like they are
playing for a draw as well.

413
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,320
That's not good enough.

414
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,720
I want them out.

415
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,240
I can't just kick them out.

416
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,760
Yes, you can. You just lack faith.

417
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,640
Maybe I could get you
tickets for the final test.

418
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,800
Would that restore your faith?

419
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,360
Greetings!
- Greetings!

420
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,880
I'm glad I ran into you.

421
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,320
I have a proposal for you.

422
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,280
I'm organizing a dinner
for all the pediatricians.

423
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,480
I thought you might
like to sponsor the dinner.

424
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,560
That way you can meet
all the best doctors

425
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,200
and you can make friends
in other hospitals.

426
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,240
You can save a
lot of time this way.

427
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,600
Sure... I think I might
be able to help you with that.

428
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,200
I knew you were the
right man for the job.

429
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,160
Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

430
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,200
Ayan!

431
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,640
I was worried the doctors would
have to pay for their own dinner.

432
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,800
Come, let me introduce you to them.

433
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Come.

434
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,760
You're going to love this.

435
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,440
You will be very happy.

436
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,120
Let me introduce you to someone...

437
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,480
and you will thank me
for the rest of your life.

438
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,320
Dr. Malik...
- Yes.

439
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
May I present Ayan Rashid.
- Greetings!

440
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,120
Greetings!
- He is a Lasta representative.

441
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,520
Okay.
- Ayan, meet Lt. Col. Dr. Malik,

442
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,320
the new Head of
the Military Hospital.

443
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,240
It is a pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.

444
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,760
Can I talk to you about
our range of products?

445
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,680
Why don't you come
to my office next week

446
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,040
we can sit and talk.

447
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,480
Thank you very much!
- You are welcome!

448
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,160
Thank you.
- Come.

449
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,440
Dr. Salim...
- Hi Maggi.

450
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,840
Maggi, this is Ayan.

451
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,120
What is the meaning of
the Lasta sign at the entrance?

452
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,360
Well they have generously
offered to pay for the dinner.

453
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,680
We're not going
to make a presentation

454
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,800
if this is a Lasta event.

455
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,800
But who will pay
for the dinner then?

456
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,000
It's them or us. Take your pick.

457
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,440
Maggi.

458
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,840
Who's that?

459
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,400
Maggi. She works for The Hub.

460
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,720
What do they do?

461
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,640
Nothing much.
They are just a pain in the neck.

462
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,400
Okay if you don't mind
don't pay for the dinner.

463
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,240
But what is their problem?

464
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,320
They work with the UN and
the World Health Organisation.

465
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,840
They just don't like
multinational companies.

466
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,560
That is their problem!

467
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,640
Anyway... you carry on.

468
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,600
I have to meet a few more doctors.

469
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,720
Greetings!
- Greetings!

470
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,560
How are you?

471
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,920
I am going to Karachi

472
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,680
to get a Masters degree
in public health care.

473
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,560
Your friend has been
awarded a scholarship!

474
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,000
That's wonderful. Congratulations.

475
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,480
Thank you.
But you don't look happy.

476
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,680
No I am...

477
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,880
I was just wondering who
will I beat at cricket now.

478
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,520
Oh you wish!

479
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,080
When was the last time
you beat me at my own game?

480
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,880
How were the doctors' wives?

481
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,200
Oh, at first they ignored me.

482
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,440
Then they started talking
about how much their husbands earn,

483
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,400
and when I told them you
are making 30,000 Rupees a month...

484
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,320
They suddenly became friendly.

485
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,560
But I'm not making 30,000.

486
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,120
How will they know?

487
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,960
Now they think that you make
more money than their husbands.

488
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,800
What's the problem with that?

489
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,320
Ayan, I did all this to
build your image... so it's fine.

490
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,040
Let's go.

491
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,200
Oh God!

492
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,200
Oh God! What happened
to my Tiger's growl?

493
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,360
Greetings!

494
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,160
I heard you've become
friends with Lt. Col. Malik.

495
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,400
Too bad you didn't
meet him a few months ago.

496
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,880
Sign here.

497
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,680
Just a formality.

498
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,520
It seems you have a lot
of fans among the doctors.

499
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,200
They seem to have only
good things to say about you.

500
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,840
You are a really lucky fellow.

501
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,120
So... it's time to
expand your frontiers.

502
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,960
I want to conquer this region.

503
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,120
I want Lasta displayed everywhere.

504
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,080
Shops, gas stations,...
pharmacies, etc..

505
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,520
Okay.

506
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,360
Zainab!

507
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,400
Zainab!

508
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,520
Come down...

509
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,960
We were so happy.

510
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,480
Ayan, how long was it until Dr.
Faiz came back from Karachi?

511
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,160
About two years?

512
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,800
Yes.

513
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,480
Our brand is recognised
and used worldwide.

514
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,080
You want the best for your
children and this is the best.

515
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,720
It's now available
in soft packs too.

516
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,520
Zainab, you shouldn't be carrying
Umer while you're pregnant.

517
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,920
I am alright.

518
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,320
What are you doing here?

519
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,280
We are here to take
part in the competition.

520
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,000
I've told you time and again,
we can't enter.

521
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,280
Of course we can...
our child is cutest of them all.

522
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,920
Mum, I am organizing this contest
and my son can't take part in it.

523
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,880
Oh my god! Why? Are you
planning to bribe the judge?

524
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,760
It's about principles!

525
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,680
It's alright.

526
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,160
As long as you follow the rules.

527
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,880
We also know right from wrong!

528
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,080
Greetings Ayan!
- Greetings!

529
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,320
I need some prescription pads.

530
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,760
Sure... come.

531
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,880
Aman, look in the front!
Darling, look ahead.

532
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,880
By God's grace!

533
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,600
He's really cute.

534
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,280
These papers came
in from head office...

535
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,040
And they said it's
mandatory to read them.

536
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,960
More paperwork.

537
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,920
Greetings!
- Greetings!

538
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,400
Please take this.
- What's this?

539
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,440
It's a gift.

540
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,000
You're very kind hearted.
- Anything for you sir.

541
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,880
Do you have any extra gifts?

542
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,360
Yes, of course.

543
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,120
This is for your two boys.

544
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,240
Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

545
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,480
How does he know
I have two children?

546
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,120
Ayan knows everything,
about everybody!

547
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,760
Faiz, you're back?

548
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,560
How are you?
- Fine.

549
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,400
Did you get your Masters degree?
- Yes.

550
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,920
That's great!
When did you get back?

551
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,200
A few weeks ago.

552
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,720
You should have called me.

553
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,320
Listen, I've moved house...
- Congratulations.

554
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,600
We're organizing a conference
on infant nutrition

555
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,360
at the Pearl Continental Hotel...

556
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,360
You should come.

557
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,920
We can catch up there and...
- Dr. Faiz.

558
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,160
She's getting worse. Please come.

559
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,240
Are you still working for Lasta?
- Yes.

560
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,400
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

561
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,880
What happened?

562
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,280
Acute dehydration
caused by diarrhoea.

563
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,120
Is there nothing you can do?

564
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,080
All her internal
organs have collapsed.

565
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,760
All we can do is pray.

566
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,360
I'll go.
- Wait...

567
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,600
I'd like you to stay.

568
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,800
After all,
you work in child nutrition.

569
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,880
This is very common here.
It's the 5th case this month.

570
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,600
Why is it so common?

571
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,440
Because of people like you, Ayan.

572
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,160
What?

573
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,680
This lady here,
she has two other children.

574
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,360
Only this one is unwell.
Do you want to know why?

575
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,840
She breastfed the other kids

576
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,520
and gave this one
your company's formula.

577
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,520
The one you've been
selling so passionately!

578
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,480
Most of my patients are illiterate.

579
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,120
They don't have
access to clean water.

580
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,200
They mix your company's formula

581
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,920
in filthy water and
give it to infants.

582
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,360
The kids get diarrhoea.

583
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,840
Breast milk provides a natural
immunity your formula can't give.

584
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,680
These babies are dying because
of your company's formula.

585
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,880
And this is happening every day.

586
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,680
Why didn't you tell
me about this two years ago?

587
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,640
Because I didn't know
until I went to Karachi.

588
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,920
So, if the doctors
prescribe formula

589
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,360
why would I think there's
a problem with the product?

590
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,200
They prescribe it because
you put pressure on them

591
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,360
by giving them gifts and money.

592
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,600
Look. It's great,
you've learned something.

593
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,640
Now, go, do what you have to do!

594
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,520
Raja.
- Yes, Sir.

595
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,920
Where is Bilal?

596
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,480
He has gone to Lahore
for a few days.

597
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,720
Tell him to call me.

598
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,560
Okay.

599
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,640
'Come on, make it fast. Come on!'

600
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,560
Greetings! - Greetings!

601
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,960
Listen Ayan,
I'm sorry I was tough on you.

602
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,040
When we banned formula
in the Karachi Hospital,

603
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,080
the babies just stopped dying.

604
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,120
It was like a miracle.

605
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,120
Just imagine...

606
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,880
all the mothers have to
do is breastfeed their babies.

607
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,480
Look.

608
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,400
A mother of twins was told

609
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,520
she should feed one
of them with milk formula.

610
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,400
The child that was breastfed,
is healthy and alive.

611
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,200
And the other one

612
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,120
died the day after
this picture was taken.

613
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,160
There was lot of
debate about this photo.

614
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,200
I've seen suggestions
that might be staged.

615
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,800
She posed for the photo
to warn other mothers.

616
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,280
Her daughter died after
the picture was taken.

617
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,320
Faiz is one of your key witnesses,

618
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,640
you are relying on him to validate
important points of your story.

619
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,360
If he endorses this
photograph on screen

620
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,080
and you can't prove
the story behind it,

621
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,720
then you risk undermining
his credibility.

622
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,400
Did he even endrose
in his statement?

623
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,320
No.
- No.

624
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,840
It was only after I went to karachi

625
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,560
and saw how people
really lived in the slums

626
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,920
that I connnected the dots.

627
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,200
But, before that I did exactly
what Ayan was paid to make me do.

628
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,760
I used to prescribe his formula

629
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,480
and helped sell these women
something they didn't even need.

630
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,920
So, after Karachi
I banned the sales reps.

631
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,280
And I showed Ayan the truth.

632
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,760
But, it never occurred to
me that he would do what he did.

633
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,120
What's wrong Ayan?

634
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,640
I am resigning.

635
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,920
What do I tell Bilal?

636
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,200
Someone has rightly said

637
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,480
why live the easy life when
you can make things complicated?

638
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,240
Don't you think I
deserve an explanation?

639
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,600
Babies are dying
because of our products.

640
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,880
How's that for a reason?

641
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,640
Don't tell me you've
fallen for that NGO shit!

642
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,560
It's not our fault Ayan...

643
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,440
if the government gives
filthy water to people.

644
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,920
You knew about this?

645
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,680
I had no clue...

646
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,400
I really have nothing more to say.

647
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,880
Don't try and act innocent Ayan!

648
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,760
You read the Charter...
so you know the rules!

649
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,240
Ayan!

650
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,680
'Lasta doesn't give incentives
to its staff based on sales.'

651
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,560
'Doesn't give financial
or material incentives'

652
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,760
'to health professionals'

653
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,920
'for the purpose of
promoting infant formula...'

654
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,240
'Lasta will take
disciplinary measures'

655
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,240
'against any Lasta personnel'

656
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,720
'who deliberately
violate this policy.'

657
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,920
They gave me money
to do all these things

658
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,280
and here they say they
will punish me if I do them.

659
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,480
I have a cupboard
filled with receipts

660
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,760
and invoices for all the incentives
I'm not supposed to have given out.

661
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,000
I have letters
from Lasta confirming

662
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,080
they allowed me
to buy these things!

663
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,400
If you can prove that you did
all this under their instructions

664
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,960
and you have all the receipts.

665
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,480
There's nothing they can do.

666
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,640
Lasta Foods is one of the
biggest companies in Pakistan.

667
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,640
Our government needs their support.

668
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,600
The Government is always
going to side with them.

669
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,840
So all the things you have
been telling me mean nothing?

670
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,640
I didn't tell you to quit your job

671
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,640
or to attack one of the biggest
food companies in the world Ayan.

672
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,520
So, might is right in your eyes?

673
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,400
I'm just a doctor in a small town.

674
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,920
I can't take responsibility
for the whole country.

675
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,400
They fired you?

676
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,840
No, I quit.

677
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,480
Are you pulling my leg?

678
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,160
Why would someone leave that job?

679
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,600
I'm not pulling your leg.

680
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,800
Here, I have this new range
of antibiotics, made in Pakistan.

681
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,200
They're a fifth of the price.

682
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,280
You know I can't take those.

683
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,320
Thank you.

684
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,680
Yes.

685
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,400
Greetings!

686
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,480
Next!

687
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,320
Read!

688
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,240
'I, being a responsible
citizen of Pakistan,'

689
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,440
'keeping in view the
illegal and unethical ways'

690
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,000
'adopted by your company,'

691
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,640
'hereby direct you
to stop your business'

692
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,920
'of infant food
manufacturing in Pakistan'

693
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,840
'and withdraw all your
infant food products'

694
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,160
'from the Pakistani markets'

695
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,160
'within 15 days of receipt
of this Legal Notice.'

696
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,080
And of course the evidence,
the receipts.

697
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,000
As a precaution,
we will keep them in a safe place.

698
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,040
Why?

699
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,440
We will just send
photocopies with the letters.

700
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,160
When the court demands the
originals, we will hand them over.

701
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,320
Until then, we will keep them safe.

702
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,760
Lock them away.

703
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,040
Greetings!
- Greetings!

704
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,000
Come in!

705
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,920
Greetings!
- Greetings!

706
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,600
Thank you for coming.

707
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,040
Thank you.

708
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,960
These are the statistics
from my hospital in Karachi.

709
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,200
I hope they are useful.

710
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,120
Please let me know
how else I can help you?

711
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,960
With God's grace!

712
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,200
We should put them
all in separate postboxes.

713
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,720
Let's go.

714
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,800
Look what we brought you.

715
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,240
I am trying to save
every Rupee I can

716
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,200
and you're buying rasmalai?

717
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,600
Have some...
Rasmalai... please have some.

718
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,440
How is it?
- It's good.

719
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,520
Do you want some more?

720
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,880
What's the matter?

721
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,760
Take me to the hospital.

722
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,800
How is Zainab?

723
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,040
Faiz says she's okay.
- Greetings!

724
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,320
These two letters came for you.

725
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,400
They're offering
to pay my expenses.

726
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,480
Do they think we are doing
all this for 20,000 Rupees?

727
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,000
We will teach them that
money can't buy everything!

728
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,200
Greetings!

729
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,320
Ayan Rashid?
- Yes.

730
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,720
Congratulations! It's a girl.

731
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,080
Thank God!

732
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,480
Ayan was very angry

733
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,480
that they tried to make him pay for
damage to his company motorcycle.

734
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,360
But, as soon as the
Legal Notice went in,

735
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,960
they agreed to pay the 20,000.

736
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,320
But they didn't
respond to the demands

737
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,120
that they stop marketing
infant formula,

738
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,640
So he sent the notice to
the World Health Organisation.

739
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,840
And that is when things
started to feel very dangerous.

740
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,120
Follow him.
- Okay.

741
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,960
There he is.

742
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,560
Come on!

743
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,080
Hey, you! Stop!

744
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,440
Greetings!
- Ayan!

745
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,000
The WHO has copied your letter to
the local district health officer

746
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,000
alleging unethical
practices by doctors.

747
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,360
So now the whole town
knows what you're up to!

748
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,280
The accusations you have made.
The names you have given.

749
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,880
Everyone's worried.

750
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,520
Doctors are refusing
to meet representatives.

751
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,080
What were you thinking?

752
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,440
I am doing what I think is right!

753
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,880
Yes, but you are forgetting
that you are just a salesman.

754
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,600
Please...

755
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,240
Please leave.

756
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,160
And please don't come back.

757
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,800
Thank you.

758
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,200
Hello!

759
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,480
Faiz!

760
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,120
Are you alright?

761
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,200
They came to my house.

762
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,160
Bilal, and another man.
I think he was his boss.

763
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,160
They said that no
one would be spared...

764
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,840
and that I am risking mine and
my family's life by supporting you.

765
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,640
What?

766
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,840
How do they know you're involved?

767
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,520
I don't know.

768
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,160
Ayan... What's going on?

769
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,920
Nothing. Go to sleep.

770
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:35,920
Hello...

771
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,280
Hi, I am Ayan.

772
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,560
Yes, I remember.
You work for Lasta.

773
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,200
Not anymore.
I used to work for Lasta.

774
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,080
I am Dr. Faiz.

775
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,880
So, how can I help you?

776
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,360
Why did you keep all
these receipts and letters?

777
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,720
They give me money
to impress the doctors.

778
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,480
I have to be able to
prove what I spend it on.

779
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,200
You kept very thorough records.

780
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,720
Is that all you have to say?

781
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,360
We need time to check
your allegations. - Time?

782
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,800
How much time do you need?

783
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,680
How many more babies should
die before you decide to trust me.

784
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,400
I'm not the one who
was selling this stuff.

785
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,920
You are right, I was.

786
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,480
Look, you can leave the receipts...
- I don't think so.

787
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,440
Let's go Faiz.

788
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,720
He is a good man and
he really needs your help.

789
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,640
I'll send you copies.

790
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,200
Hello?

791
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,560
Yes Colonel.

792
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,240
I am fine, how are you?

793
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,040
Yes.

794
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,440
Yes the Pakistani products... yes.

795
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,080
Whenever you say, I will come.

796
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,600
Yes. Thank you.

797
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,560
Goodbye!

798
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,240
Greetings!

799
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,000
Greetings!

800
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,000
Do you want some tea?
- No.

801
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,280
Where are you going?

802
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,560
Stay at home
take care of yourself and kids.

803
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,920
Is everything alright?

804
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,360
Everything is alright.

805
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,080
Dad will stay with you.

806
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,120
Goodbye!

807
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,560
Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

808
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,480
My angel...

809
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,120
I've spent 20 years in the army,

810
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,280
never had any problems,

811
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,080
and now this.

812
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,080
What do you think
you are doing Ayan?

813
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,560
How dare you mention my
name in all your legal nonsense?

814
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,880
I want you to find a
solution to this problem, now.

815
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,120
Colonel, there are
babies dying every year...

816
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,600
Don't mess with us boy.

817
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,880
What are you getting out of this?

818
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,880
Nothing...
- Ayan...

819
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,320
It's not too late.

820
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,880
The company will take you back.

821
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,560
I'm not joking.
- I'm not coming back.

822
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,840
Sorry?

823
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,440
I'm not coming back.

824
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,840
You're mad.
Think about your family, Ayan!

825
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,440
What about my family?

826
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,320
Are you threatening me?

827
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,000
You've accused people
of taking bribes.

828
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,400
You've made a lot of enemies.

829
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,000
I don't have to threaten you.

830
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,360
Do you know what
you're playing with?

831
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,360
You do what you want to do
and I'll do what I have to.

832
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,960
Ayan, stop.

833
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,880
What do you think this is?

834
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,600
A street market? You can
walk in and out as you please?

835
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,080
Colonel, you are a father yourself.

836
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,560
Imagine if your sons died?

837
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,760
Soldier!
- Yes sir!

838
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,800
How would you feel?
- Keep this man under guard.

839
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,800
"O my Almighty!"

840
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:14,400
"O my Almighty!"

841
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:19,080
"O my Almighty!"

842
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,800
"O my Almighty!"

843
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,640
You should choose
your battles carefully.

844
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,600
Sometimes peace is
better than being right.

845
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,520
These people could buy
the whole government of Pakistan,

846
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,080
put it in a box, wrap it up with
ribbons and sell it as a souvenir.

847
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,040
You can fight with them,

848
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,280
but you can't win.

849
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,680
'And this is the diarrhoea ward'

850
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,280
'of the National Institute
of Child Health in Karachi.'

851
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,400
'You may find this scene as
distressing as we did filming it.'

852
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,960
'But it's a common
event in this hospital.

853
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,360
'This little girl
was badly malnourished'

854
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:10,120
'and then dehydrated after
several bouts of diarrhoea.'

855
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,280
'She was so sick,
when other complications set in

856
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,400
'there was little
chance of saving her.'

857
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,800
'There are wards like this in every
hospital we saw here in Karachi.'

858
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,760
'Cases are tragically similar.'

859
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,640
'The pattern is being
repeated around the country.'

860
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,080
What's going on?

861
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,320
Ayan...

862
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,600
Maggi's been through the evidence.
She thinks it's great.

863
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,760
She has spoken to some people.

864
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,240
You should see this video.

865
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,600
Greetings!

866
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,840
First of all apologies
for the other day.

867
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,200
I had no idea until you

868
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,480
presented this
unbelievable material.

869
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,720
This is incredible evidence.

870
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,200
I've never seen this
in 20 years of working

871
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,840
and I just wanted to say that

872
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,080
no one from inside
has ever produced this.

873
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,680
This kind of information
and this is a smoking gun.

874
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,040
What is she doing here?

875
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,560
What do you mean?

876
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,360
Ayan.

877
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,520
What's going on?

878
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,000
I have no idea.

879
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,160
What's wrong?

880
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,880
Zainab, this is too dangerous.

881
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,880
I can't risk your life or the kids.

882
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,240
Don't you dare use
me and our children

883
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,360
as a reason to
not do what is right.

884
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,120
Did you tell her how
dangerous this can be?

885
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,120
How dangerous these people are?

886
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,240
What could happen to my family,
did you tell her?

887
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,400
Ayan...

888
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,600
Ayan.

889
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,440
If you do this,
we might be ruined forever

890
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,520
but if you don't do this,

891
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,560
I won't be able
to respect you again.

892
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,600
I wanted to protect my family,
my children.

893
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,600
Zainab wanted to protect
everyone's else children.

894
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,480
Take care of yourself.
- Don't worry.

895
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,640
Goodbye.

896
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,120
Ayan let's call it a day.

897
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,840
It's probably around lunch
time in Torronto. - Okay.

898
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,040
And it's dinner time here.

899
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,600
Bye.
= Bye.

900
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,320
Listen Ayan.
Speak to you tomorrow.

901
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,000
Hey, Frank do you
wanna stay for a drink?

902
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,200
Ahh... I'm already late.
I'll see you tommorow.

903
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,720
Bye.
- Bye.

904
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,720
We are definitely
changing those names.

905
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,120
Why? - Because we gave him a chance
to tell the truth and he didn't.

906
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,440
What do you mean?

907
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,800
Why would Ayan decide to
fight after he was being threatend?

908
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,360
He realised that his evidence
could make a difference.

909
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,880
Saint Ayan.

910
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,560
Come on, Maggi.

911
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,160
We heard some stories in
pakistan that we can't ignore.

912
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,160
Look we worked on this for months.

913
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,280
We checked and double
checked the documents.

914
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,640
What are you telling me?

915
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,600
I want to hear the truth.

916
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,040
I'm this close to walking
away from this project.

917
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,840
Do you understand?

918
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,160
Maggi you know how this goes.

919
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,080
If there are any holes
in the story they will kill us.

920
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,280
Tell us. What happened?

921
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,600
This is really good.

922
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,920
They authorised a gift of
an air conditioner to a doctor.

923
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,040
Ayan we need a chain of evidence.

924
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,280
Letters from your supervisors,
copies of cheques.

925
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,120
You say they put
cash in your account.

926
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,120
But can you actually
prove you used the cash

927
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,880
to pay for the air conditioner?

928
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,040
But what does it matter?

929
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,040
Bilal approved it, look it says...

930
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,280
'Ok, but sales must go up...'

931
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,720
Can you prove you
spent the money for it?

932
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,280
I'm tired of this.

933
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,320
Greetings!

934
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,920
Greetings!
- Are you okay?

935
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,240
Welcome to my new home!

936
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,280
Hello Maggi...

937
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,560
Dr. Faiz how are you?
- Good.

938
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,160
Look.

939
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,880
Looks great!
- Thank you.

940
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,080
Not sure about the colour yet.
We'll see...

941
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,360
You should talk to Ayan.
- Why?

942
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,600
If we try to publish
this in Pakistan

943
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,000
we can't guarantee his safety.

944
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,800
And this may never
see the light of day.

945
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,240
So...

946
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,000
We need international support.

947
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,920
In the meantime we
need to keep him safe.

948
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:28,560
Yes.

949
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,840
You know what people
are saying about you?

950
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,880
According to them you
are the worst guy around.

951
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:45,200
And they feel you have
a hidden motive behind all this.

952
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,320
Honestly speaking
half the city is looking for you!

953
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,320
Are you okay?

954
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,880
Yes, I am fine...

955
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,480
don't worry about me,
you take care of yourself.

956
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,200
Thanks very much for coming!

957
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,600
Maggi...

958
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,520
What did she want?
- Oh, she's a nurse.

959
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,160
She came to see if
we needed any volunteers.

960
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,640
She's not a nurse.
She's a Lasta executive.

961
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
What? No.

962
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,840
I've seen her before.

963
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,520
"God is the greatest!"

964
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,960
"God is the greatest!"

965
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,880
"God is the greatest!"

966
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,360
Michael is a friend
and a very good journalist

967
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:33,160
and he is going to make a
documentary film on Ayan's story!

968
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,200
We will launch this

969
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,160
the same day as the
film comes out on German TV.

970
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,960
We have a slot for the
film in about a month...

971
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:47,960
But to make a big splash

972
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,960
we need Ayan to come
back with us to Germany

973
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,600
to do the press and the publicity.

974
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,920
I can't leave my family here.

975
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,040
Ayan, it's not going to be long.

976
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,360
How long?

977
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,520
A month, I guess.

978
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,080
For the launch and the publicity,

979
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,040
we need to do for the
whole story to come out.

980
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,520
So be it.

981
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,520
Even if it takes longer.

982
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,000
I will look after the family.

983
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,720
Let's have some tea.

984
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,360
Dad, am I invisible
all of a sudden?

985
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,720
You are my son.
And I am proud of you.

986
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,120
But sometimes you have to let your
parents make decisions for you.

987
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,040
Let's have tea.

988
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,040
This is not about publicity, is it?

989
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,880
No...

990
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,520
If he is here when this goes public

991
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,160
well, there are going to
be a lot of angry people around.

992
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:06,640
When this goes on TV in Europe,
do you think...?

993
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,160
He will come back as a hero.
I promise you.

994
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,920
And everyone will have to listen.

995
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,000
"You are my peace of mind."

996
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:35,520
"You are my serenity."

997
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:45,040
"You are the reason
my life is beautiful."

998
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:50,440
"Although the world is..."

999
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,480
The population is
growing so fast that

1000
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,800
the potential market
for formula is enormous.

1001
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,160
Five million babies are
born in Pakistan every year

1002
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,200
and this number is
just going to increase, so

1003
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,920
the potential hazard that
this could cause is enormous.

1004
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,680
It's not just the filthy water.

1005
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,120
Parents want the western brands
marketed by international companies

1006
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,400
because they make them think

1007
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,120
their kids will be smarter
if they drink formula milk.

1008
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,160
But some mothers can't afford it,
so they dilute it.

1009
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,880
Just one spoonful less,
who's going to notice?

1010
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,120
Well the babies do.

1011
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,240
They lose weight,
they get ill and die.

1012
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,960
The World Health
Organisation claims

1013
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:25,480
breastfeeding could save up
to 1.5 million babies every year.

1014
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,840
1.5 million babies every year.

1015
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:33,480
"O, Lord... Lord have mercy!"

1016
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:38,480
"O, Lord... I bow to You!"

1017
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,920
"O Lord!

1018
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,920
"O Lord!
1.5 million babies every year.

1019
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:48,280
"O, Lord... Lord have mercy!"

1020
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:52,440
"O Lord!

1021
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,200
"I bow to You! O Lord..."

1022
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,320
Pray for me.

1023
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,720
Please do it yourself...

1024
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,040
I am not sure if my
prayers will reach so far!

1025
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,520
Come here...

1026
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,680
Dad, how will you manage?

1027
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:29,720
Don't worry about us.

1028
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,840
I will go back and
collect a few things.

1029
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,680
I mean...

1030
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,160
how can we survive without a VCR?

1031
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,360
Now this is what we call progress!

1032
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,280
Please take care!
- Goodbye!

1033
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,240
Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

1034
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,800
Goodbye!

1035
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,560
'Flight QR615 on the tarmac.'

1036
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,800
'It is taxying...'

1037
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,160
Is that for hire?

1038
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,160
In Germany,
all the taxis are Mercedes?

1039
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,600
Yes.

1040
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,880
But then...
what does your President drive?

1041
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,440
Your car, Mr. President.

1042
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,800
Do you agree your product
should not be used

1043
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,880
where there is
no safe water supply?

1044
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,600
We gave all the evidence
to the institutional people...

1045
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,000
Yes or no.

1046
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:17,000
Yes, but listen, this is
not the point we should talk.

1047
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:20,240
Where the people are so poor
that they are going to dilute it

1048
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,400
and that's going to endanger
health, it should not be used?

1049
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,600
Of course not.

1050
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,520
But like I said before,
this is not the point...

1051
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,440
What is your corporate
responsibility

1052
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,080
to find out the extent
of the use of your product

1053
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,120
in the developing parts of
the world in those circumstances?

1054
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,400
We cannot have that
responsibility. - Why?

1055
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,360
We have a massive product, you see,

1056
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,440
We have thousand of babies dying...

1057
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,000
We have a product...

1058
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,760
Ayan...

1059
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,000
Look...

1060
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,640
"Scandal Um Babymilch"
(Scandal in Baby Milk)

1061
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,200
Oh, this is so good.

1062
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,200
Before this problem...
- Listen... listen...

1063
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,480
The people, the Pakistani people...

1064
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,360
I'm not sitting here
and letting you...

1065
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,960
Who are poor...
- treat me like a criminal.

1066
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:03,880
I am sorry!
- Excuse me!

1067
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,000
I don't want to treat
you like a criminal...

1068
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,640
I just want to come back
to my question... - Excuse me!

1069
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:09,720
One thing is sure, this programme
is going nowhere. - What...

1070
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,880
'Programme promises
devastating new evidence'

1071
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,760
'of multinational companies
putting profits'

1072
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,360
'before the lives of babies."

1073
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,840
Yes...
- Hey, that was great.

1074
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,400
You should be proud of yourself.
This is going to be huge.

1075
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,280
I have to continue with the edit.

1076
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,520
Nervous?

1077
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,680
You're going to be great.

1078
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,320
Trust yourself.

1079
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,080
Come with me please.

1080
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,320
Why?
- Come with me.

1081
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,600
Come with me.
- What is it?

1082
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,000
I don't know.
But we'll find out pretty soon.

1083
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,640
So, what's going on?

1084
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:23,280
Ayan.

1085
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,400
Listen, I want to settle this issue

1086
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,040
but I can't authorise any amount

1087
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,960
as I have to first discuss
with our top management.

1088
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,280
I can't decide on
this issue on my own.

1089
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,600
The company sees your
action as blackmail.

1090
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,320
I want to settle this
issue once and for all.

1091
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,840
And if you don't solve this

1092
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,320
those people who are behind me,
they will take action.

1093
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,360
Do you understand?

1094
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,440
How much does your
management have in mind?

1095
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,280
$60,000 is a big amount and
requires management approval.

1096
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:54,720
Okay,

1097
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,000
Meet me here on Friday
at 3 pm to finalise this.

1098
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,360
Is this your voice?

1099
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,760
And you had no idea?

1100
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,080
Do you think, I would have
gone that far if I'd known?

1101
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,400
Come on! That's crap, we've
been working on this for a month.

1102
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,240
All your evidence is from the man

1103
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,080
you have heard
on that tape Michael.

1104
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,960
Excuse me Günther...

1105
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:27,840
What are we talking about?
What is this about?

1106
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,440
It was before you came back.

1107
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,280
Before you showed me the films.

1108
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:40,120
'These people could buy
the whole government of Pakistan,'

1109
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:43,680
'put it in a box, wrap it up with
ribbons and sell it as a souvenir.'

1110
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,680
'You can fight with them,'

1111
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,200
'but you can't win.'

1112
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:57,560
'But, if you are smart,'

1113
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
'this could all work out
very well for you.'

1114
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,880
'Hello Bilal.'

1115
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,240
'I've spoken to Ayan
I would like you to talk to him.'

1116
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,480
'Ayan.'

1117
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,560
'Listen I want to
settle this issue,'

1118
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,160
'but I can't authorise any amount'

1119
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,200
'as I have to first discuss
with our top management.'

1120
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,520
'I can't decide on
this issue on my own.'

1121
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:34,040
'The company sees your
action as blackmail.'

1122
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,880
'I want to settle this
issue once and for all.'

1123
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:43,960
'And if you don't solve this,'

1124
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,920
'those people who are behind me,
they will take action.'

1125
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,840
'Do you understand?'

1126
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,360
'How much does your
management have in mind?'

1127
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,920
'$60,000 is a big amount and
requires management approval.'

1128
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,560
'Okay, meet me here on
Friday at 3 pm to finalise this.'

1129
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,000
'What's going on?'

1130
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,840
'What is she doing here?
- What do you mean?'

1131
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,600
'Why did you bring her here?'

1132
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,760
'Ayan...
- Tell her to leave... now!'

1133
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:35,560
'If you do this,
we might be ruined forever'

1134
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,680
'but if you don't do this,
I'll never respect you again.'

1135
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,040
You knew there'd
been talk of blackmail.

1136
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,960
"Unsubstantiated"
talk about blackmail.

1137
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:50,400
But not that he actually
set out to get the money.

1138
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,280
But he didn't take the money.
That's the whole point.

1139
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,200
He never took the money!

1140
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,760
Why would Ayan
have sent the Legal Notice

1141
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,120
with all his best evidence
to the World Health Organisation

1142
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,200
if he was planning blackmail?

1143
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,760
I mean look.

1144
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,520
17th of January,

1145
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,520
he writes a letter to
the W.H.O asking for help.

1146
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:29,720
Right?

1147
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,240
28th of january, they write back

1148
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,520
saying there's nothing they can do,
copying in the local doctor.

1149
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:38,080
That's when everyone
finds out about this.

1150
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:40,440
But it's nearly another month,

1151
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,280
before the meeting about the money.

1152
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:46,040
I mean, he'd be the most
incompetent blackmailer in history.

1153
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,720
Hey I've got all
this great stuff on you

1154
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,120
and I'm gonna go public on it
unless you give me money.

1155
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,320
Except I've already
gone public with it.

1156
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,880
I mean it doesn't make sense.

1157
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,920
It doesn't mean he wasn't
going to take a pay off.

1158
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,240
Yeah, but there's
a world of difference

1159
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,960
between considering a pay off

1160
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,120
and masterminding a blackmail plot.

1161
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,120
And meanwhile there were
thirteen international companies

1162
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,240
selling infant formula in Pakistan.

1163
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,880
How do we convince Frank?

1164
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,240
I spent my time buying doctors.

1165
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,000
Why would I have been surprised
when they wanted to buy me?

1166
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,000
But think about it.

1167
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,560
Why did they tape me?

1168
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,840
I mean I was in
a military hospital,

1169
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,920
surrounded by men with guns.

1170
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,320
If they saw my actions as blackmail
why didn't they arrest me?

1171
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,000
Because they didn't want
your eveidence to be heard.

1172
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,760
This is stupid.

1173
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,800
I gave them the perfect reason

1174
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,680
to make sure no-one
would listen to me.

1175
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,200
Ayan.

1176
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,400
Why did you not take the money?

1177
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,280
I went to my father.

1178
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,840
And he told me that

1179
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,120
no son of his would
be so unprincipled.

1180
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,160
And that I would be
a bloody fool to think that

1181
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,200
they would give me $60,000.

1182
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,560
So, I never went back.

1183
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,720
Ayan.

1184
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,680
I want you to know
that I believe you.

1185
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,520
But they stopped the
German T.V with that tape.

1186
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,880
And the same thing will happen
here unless we do something.

1187
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,520
I want to include
everything in the film.

1188
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,920
You gonna show me as a blackmailer
a lia, a foger?

1189
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,440
Maggi told me I
would return a hero.

1190
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,920
Well, I have to go to work soon.

1191
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,720
I make the best donuts in Toronto.

1192
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:45,280
It's a good local company.
With no multinationals involved.

1193
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,120
Ayan.

1194
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,360
I'm a lawyer,
I think this film is a risk.

1195
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,880
But,

1196
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,280
It is do-able, if we do this way.

1197
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,280
But we have few problems.

1198
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:00,800
The blackmail allegations they
will make you look, forgive me,

1199
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,200
they will make you look unreliable.

1200
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,200
And they will say it's anold story.

1201
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,840
This is how old the story is.

1202
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:10,280
I haven't seen my wife
or my children

1203
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,080
in seven years.

1204
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,960
My mother and father died,
I wasn't there.

1205
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,640
Frank, this was happening
in Africa in the 70's.

1206
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,520
All over Asia in the 80's and 90's

1207
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,560
and you just send
a reasearcher to Pakistan

1208
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:27,160
to prove that this is
still happening there now.

1209
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:31,280
It's an old story, that's alive.

1210
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,240
It keeps repeating itself.

1211
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,160
And that's why we
have to make this film.

1212
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,240
Okay, but...

1213
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,400
This has to be referred up.

1214
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,320
To the very top.

1215
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:48,840
You do what you have to do.

1216
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,440
Hey.

1217
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,040
Hi, Frank... How are you doing?

1218
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,320
I am sorry.
They won't take the risk.

1219
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,640
What?

1220
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,160
They could sue
us in the High Court.

1221
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,640
Here or in Paris or Lahore.

1222
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,600
It could cost 100s
of 1000s of pounds,

1223
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:11,640
just to prove it's true.

1224
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:14,040
So Ayan ruins his entire life,

1225
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:17,080
and you are not prepared
to take a legal risk.

1226
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,120
It's my job to assess
that level risk.

1227
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,800
Oh, yes, yes.
And you are wonderful at your job.

1228
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:25,280
But that's exactly what
the multinationals rely on.

1229
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,240
That we obey the rules.

1230
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,200
So they can do whatever they like.

1231
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,600
I filmed babies dying.

1232
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,520
I know this is real.

1233
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,800
I don't care what he did.

1234
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:40,080
You can take Ayan out of this story
but the evidence still stands.

1235
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,920
And if someone in that corporation

1236
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,480
is prepared to go to these
lengths to discredit him,

1237
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,320
what does that tell you?

1238
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,160
This man has risked everything.

1239
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,160
He left his family
in Pakistan and now...

1240
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,960
if you don't show the programme,

1241
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:54,840
he can never go back.

1242
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,360
I'm sorry.

1243
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,960
There's nothing I can do.

1244
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,680
Guenther please!
You can't be serious

1245
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,040
you're letting them pressurise you?

1246
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,320
Who is pressurising you?
Tell me! Who is pressurising you?

1247
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,760
Michael! Please calm down!
- Come on tell me! Tell me now!

1248
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,080
I can't transmit it!

1249
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,200
That's nonsense we
have enough evidence...

1250
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:27,960
"I mourn in my loneliness."

1251
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:36,560
"My beloved,"

1252
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:44,440
"I feel the chill
of our separation."

1253
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:54,880
"I mourn in my loneliness."

1254
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:03,480
"My beloved,"

1255
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:11,880
"I feel the chill
of our separation."

1256
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:21,920
"I miss your lovely voice."

1257
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:30,520
"Your miss your beautiful smile."

1258
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:38,120
"I feel the chill
of our separation."

1259
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:42,440
"This distance"

1260
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:49,040
"fills my heart with tears."

1261
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,560
"Dreams of you"

1262
01:23:57,080 --> 01:24:03,360
"fill my senses."

1263
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:11,160
"I surrender my dreams to you!"

1264
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:22,680
"I mourn in my loneliness."

1265
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:31,440
"My beloved,"

1266
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:39,400
"I feel the chill
of our separation."

1267
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:49,440
"I mourn in my loneliness."

1268
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:57,720
"My beloved,"

1269
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:06,600
"I feel the chill
of our separation."

1270
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:16,640
"I miss your lovely voice."

1271
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:24,800
"Your miss your beautiful smile."

1272
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:32,640
"I feel the chill
of our separation."

1273
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,000
"This distance"

1274
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:41,640
"fills my heart with tears."

1275
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:49,640
"Dreams of you"

1276
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:58,280
"fill my senses."
