1
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,683
What did you say his name was?

2
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:09,683
Ma'am?

3
00:02:11,142 --> 00:02:12,142
His name?

4
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,183
Rocky.

5
00:02:15,142 --> 00:02:16,267
Rocky who?

6
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:18,350
Mental.

7
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,808
I wasn't born yesterday.

8
00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:38,600
You don't have to tell me what to do.

9
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:46,600
They forbade us.

10
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,600
Why are you hiding?

11
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:57,392
Show yourself.

12
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:00,725
Let's do this face to face.

13
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:10,100
Watch out, here I come.

14
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:28,933
Don't delay it any further, sir.

15
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:32,017
Declare me the winner
as per the rules.

16
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:38,017
Sir, media is here.

17
00:04:38,517 --> 00:04:40,267
Throw in the towel
and forfeit the match.

18
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,267
I too have a responsibility.

19
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:45,142
Disqualify Rocky.

20
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:46,767
Declare him the winner.

21
00:04:47,808 --> 00:04:49,308
Don't disqualify him, sir.

22
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:50,725
Rocky will be here soon.

23
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:52,100
I've just spoken to him.

24
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:54,058
Don't disqualify him, sir.

25
00:04:54,517 --> 00:04:55,600
It's the state's finals.

26
00:05:02,808 --> 00:05:06,683
So Patiala, cat caught your tongue?

27
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:10,517
Don't see your high
flying boxer anywhere?

28
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:12,850
Why the sad face chimp?

29
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:15,225
Why?

30
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:17,225
Nothing to say today?

31
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,433
Having a banana, huh?
Don't you wish to have my slap?

32
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,017
I'll have you peeled from head to toe.

33
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:55,267
You monkey, I won't spare any spot.

34
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,392
Don't waste your time here.

35
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,808
Go and guard your boss.

36
00:06:05,642 --> 00:06:07,225
Who's too eager to win the match.

37
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:10,142
The fight will take place soon.

38
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:13,683
Make sure he doesn't faint
before off anxiety.

39
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,558
Today Rocky will teach
you loudmouths a good lesson.

40
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:21,183
He won't be able to do anything.

41
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:24,850
You won't even see his shadow today.

42
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:29,183
Here, I am standing before you.

43
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,225
Let's see what he does.

44
00:06:51,517 --> 00:06:54,267
Brother,
I had asked Satbir to do the job.

45
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:57,350
He had said he'd get rid of him.

46
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:00,267
It's not so easy.

47
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:06,767
Now it is going to
have an insulting end.

48
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:04,975
'Village Fatehgarh Chhanna's resident
Rocky wins Punjab Boxing State final.'

49
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:08,850
'Now all eyes on the state
boxing champion Rajdeep Singh.'

50
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:13,100
'Rajdeep Singh (Rocky),
a rising star of Punjab boxing.'

51
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:17,142
'Punjab's star Rajdeep Singh
enters National quarterfinals.'

52
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:24,683
'Rajdeep Singh defeats last time's winner
with a knockout in the semifinal.'

53
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:00,392
Mr. Shergill,

54
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:04,058
as the sports minister, what would you
like to say about Rocky's achievements?

55
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:08,683
At the moment,
boxing is at its peak in this country.

56
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:13,683
At this level,
there is no competition for us.

57
00:09:14,642 --> 00:09:18,350
Out of the boxers chosen
for the commonwealth games..

58
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,100
..no one can match
up to this boy's talent.

59
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:24,267
Media and opposition only
talk about Punjab's drug addicts.

60
00:09:24,392 --> 00:09:28,683
Now this boy will tell them
what can a youth from Punjab do.

61
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:31,308
We are standing inside Rocky's house.

62
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:35,683
At his mother's maternal village,
Fatehgarh Chhanna.

63
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:39,433
We all know about the fame
Rocky has earned in the boxing world.

64
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:45,683
Come, let's show the life and childhood
of this star outside the limelight.

65
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,767
Kids are born mischievous.

66
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:52,350
I am Rajdeep's uncle.

67
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,100
What can I say about his childhood?

68
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:56,767
He has been a wild child
since the very beginning.

69
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:59,975
Old ladies used to complain
about him to his mother.

70
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,517
He used to sometimes
break someone's head.

71
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,058
Sometimes he would dislocate bones.

72
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:04,475
What can I say?

73
00:10:04,558 --> 00:10:06,267
Our boy used to be responsible
for all the injuries

74
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,933
caused to other kids in the village.

75
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:11,475
It's God's grace that he
has been blessed with such fame.

76
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,225
There is a good possibility
of injuries when it comes to boxing.

77
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,767
Aren't you scared for your son?

78
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,017
Why should I feel scared, dear?

79
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,392
He plays under the
shade provided by Lord.

80
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:21,433
He watches everything.

81
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,558
He used to love to fight.

82
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:25,142
Till the time he
stayed in the village..

83
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,933
..the boys in the village
feared for their well being.

84
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:29,267
He caused so much damage.

85
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:31,725
Cracked a few skulls.

86
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,433
Where's Kala?

87
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:34,517
Where's Kala?

88
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,558
Kala! Come here, oh brave one.

89
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:41,558
Permanently brain damaged
at the hands of Rocky.

90
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,267
Come here, oh brave one. Hurry up.

91
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,142
Look, they are taking
an interview for television.

92
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:48,892
Greet them.
Fold your hands and welcome them.

93
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:51,850
He is shy.

94
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:53,100
It's okay.

95
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:56,058
Don't worry. They just
want to talk to you about Rocky.

96
00:10:56,225 --> 00:10:57,725
About brother?
- Yes.

97
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,517
Hello.

98
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:02,767
Villagers have never
seen a rivalry like ours.

99
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:05,767
Brother Rocky and I have
fought a number of times.

100
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,142
Brother Rocky used
to lift me up like this.

101
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:13,975
Like Lord Krishna had lifted
the mountain on his little finger.

102
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:15,433
Just like that.

103
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:17,475
You don't believe it?

104
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,350
She doesn't believe it.

105
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:20,392
My teeth...

106
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,767
May my brother live
and nice and a happy life.

107
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,725
Love you, brother Rocky.

108
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:30,058
Love you, brother Rocky!

109
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:32,267
Where are you from? - Shut...

110
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:37,350
'A clash between Bikram
Sherpurwala gang and ANSI.'

111
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:42,558
'A clash between Bikram
Sherpurwala gang and ANSI.'

112
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,225
'Boxer 'Rocky' a part
of university shootout.'

113
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:03,058
I have only two years left
until retirement, Mr. Sekhon.

114
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,642
I thought they would
pass without any trouble.

115
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:10,183
But I got the orders from the top.

116
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:12,767
And I have to follow
the orders that I get.

117
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,100
It's a job. I cannot question them.

118
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:22,600
Mr. Sekhon, I was going
to call you in a day or two.

119
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,725
Good that you came on your own.

120
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:28,517
Whatever that happened in
the past few days was unfortunate.

121
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,808
For you as well as for the federation.

122
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,600
Federation was affected in a bad way.

123
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:43,767
The whole world knows about your
contribution to this field, to boxing.

124
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,225
But the stigma on your
name because of this...

125
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:53,433
There are salary arrears
that federation owes me.

126
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:55,183
I had come to give
an application for that.

127
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:05,183
Tainted in a doping racket,
Waryam Singh Sekhon resigns.

128
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:10,142
Indian boxing coach Waryam Singh
Sekhon caught in a doping scandal.

129
00:13:10,392 --> 00:13:13,975
Just a few moments before
the final Commonwealth team selection

130
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:16,892
Waryam Singh accused
of doping allegations

131
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:52,392
Players miss you, sir.

132
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:56,392
The Game needs you.

133
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,392
I have dedicated my life to this game.

134
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:09,017
Rocky is paying for what he did, sir.

135
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,850
You aren't responsible
for his circumstances.

136
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:47,975
This is the Indian National camp,
not your village wrestling pit.

137
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:53,225
Players here play for
their country and their careers.

138
00:14:53,308 --> 00:14:55,558
You don't deserve to be in this camp.

139
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,475
Go away.

140
00:14:57,808 --> 00:15:00,350
Go be a tough guy somewhere else.

141
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,475
Get lost from here.

142
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:02,475
Out!

143
00:15:56,808 --> 00:15:58,975
Preet! Earthquake!
Earthquake! The roof is falling!

144
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,058
I am dead! I am so dead! Earthquake!

145
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:02,683
Where are you going?

146
00:16:03,683 --> 00:16:07,558
Wait! - Let me go, Rocky!
Let me jump, the roof is falling.

147
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,642
Let the roof fall,
I won't let any harm come to you.

148
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:12,850
Rocky, it's not so easy
to come out of the rubbles.

149
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:16,267
Behave yourself.
What is this nonsense?

150
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:25,058
Preet! Sweetheart! I was just joking.

151
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:29,392
You dog. You almost killed me.

152
00:16:29,558 --> 00:16:31,850
You have crossed your
limits of friendship, Rocky.

153
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:34,600
You were the one crossing the limits.

154
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:37,475
Rocky, let me go. Let me jump.

155
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,142
My mansions and pillars are falling.

156
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:44,017
Don't make me curse at this holy hour.

157
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,808
No brother, don't curse me.

158
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,975
"Don't come closer, I don't like you."

159
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:52,642
I don't wish to dwell
in your eyes, woman.

160
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:54,392
Stop the drama and get up.
Let's go running.

161
00:16:54,475 --> 00:16:56,600
I won't move a limb
even if you are dying.

162
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:57,683
Lord Almighty.

163
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:03,267
Baby... hey baby...

164
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:06,683
Go away, you leech.
Don't you have to attend the camp?

165
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:09,975
Baby, I am out of the camp.

166
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:11,725
Coach threw you out?

167
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,975
What happened?

168
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,975
a shootout at the university
happened ... don't remember ...

169
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:25,767
Rocky bro, it's just going
to be us and them ... no one else ...

170
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,142
didn't turn out like that did it?

171
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:29,725
Half the university
turned witness on me.

172
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:33,058
but Devinder bro was
certain there would be no one

173
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:36,767
what the hell's wrong with you? you're
getting way too close to Devinder ...

174
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,725
Don't blame me.

175
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,725
I don't tag you along.

176
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,933
As if you fight only for me
, right?

177
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:47,308
Oh Lord!
What dark times! What dark times!

178
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,308
You fight for them and
then they unjustly accuse you.

179
00:17:50,392 --> 00:17:52,600
Strike these sinners down almighty

180
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:56,642
Scoundrel.
- Get up!

181
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:58,100
Freshen up and change.

182
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,808
I've had enough, Rocky.

183
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:01,183
Go back to your hostel.

184
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:03,225
Don't want to see the sight of you.

185
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:07,933
Oh my, this is what makes
me crazy about you, sweetheart.

186
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:11,767
Let me see how you
don't go for running.

187
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:20,142
Come on baby, get up.

188
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,225
What are you doing, Rocky? Let me go.

189
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:26,767
Rocky! Get me down.
- Let's go.

190
00:18:55,182 --> 00:18:57,391
Hey! Hey! Hey! Did you see that?

191
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:02,974
Hey!

192
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:06,391
They wind is fast,
don't get yourself hurt.

193
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:08,932
He isn't scared. He is fearless.

194
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:10,474
I have seen many boxers.

195
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:13,474
But they are the first ones
I have seen who punch in the air.

196
00:19:13,974 --> 00:19:17,849
Ibadat, in local terms
this is called swanking.

197
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:23,266
I have seen dogs barking,
chasing after cars,

198
00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:26,599
never seen them barking
from inside one.

199
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:31,432
What the hell!

200
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:38,474
You okay, bro? Put your
hand down let me see. - I'm fine.

201
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:41,391
I'm seriously done with
these house parites man,

202
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:42,891
Ibs, let's go to Delhi.

203
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,557
I seriously need to update
my late winter wardrobe

204
00:19:46,016 --> 00:19:47,057
So...

205
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:53,516
Seriously?

206
00:19:57,849 --> 00:19:59,141
You have a penchant for trouble.

207
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:03,182
Stop talking and
learn to use your hands.

208
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:09,391
If you end being confronted,
a good hook will help you.

209
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,141
Really? Any other advice?

210
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:14,807
Keep him on leash. He's crazy.

211
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:16,224
Hey!

212
00:20:16,557 --> 00:20:17,682
How dare you touch her?

213
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:29,182
Ibadat, in local terms
this is called swanking.

214
00:20:30,724 --> 00:20:32,557
You hit him as well
because of me, right?

215
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:34,141
You want to go first?

216
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:37,057
Tell me if you need anything else.

217
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:39,099
We done?

218
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:41,391
You've left an impression.
Can we go now?

219
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:43,807
Let's have another swig.

220
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:45,641
I'm done.

221
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:46,974
Let's go.

222
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:59,807
Brother,
there is a boy from Rotak, Bholu.

223
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:00,766
What's his room number?

224
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:01,224
I don't know.

225
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:02,099
Damn you.

226
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:05,849
He is here since 6 years.
Still no one knows him.

227
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:11,307
Brother,
there is a boy from Rotak, Bholu.

228
00:21:12,016 --> 00:21:12,516
Damn you.

229
00:21:13,891 --> 00:21:16,391
He is here since 6 years.
Still no one knows him.

230
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:19,599
Brother,
there is a boy from Rotak, Bholu.

231
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:20,891
What's his room number?

232
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,099
Damn you.

233
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,724
He is staying in this hotel
since 6 years. Still no one knows him.

234
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,432
Bholu!

235
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:41,974
Bholu!

236
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:44,641
Bholu!

237
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:48,349
Bholu!

238
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,807
Have you lost it?
- Stop saying Bholu!

239
00:21:51,891 --> 00:21:53,349
Shall I call you Lankesh, instead?

240
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,057
Hello, brother.

241
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:03,307
Rajdeep Singh Taliwal.

242
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:08,307
I heard you've take over our group?

243
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:13,141
These recruits are getting too
ambitious . They want success overnight.

244
00:22:13,724 --> 00:22:15,307
That's convenient.

245
00:22:15,516 --> 00:22:17,974
I keep fighting the enemies
and you grab all the headlines.

246
00:22:18,057 --> 00:22:19,724
You cannot grab the headlines
by doing next to nothing.

247
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:24,641
Here's the solution.

248
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:30,807
First of all, sell off the
hyenas you surround yourself with.

249
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:37,057
And get yourself treated.
Your bones are stiff.

250
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:39,641
And if you get a good deal
on courage in the market take it.

251
00:22:40,016 --> 00:22:44,432
I'll pay for it.
From my personal account.

252
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:47,057
Don't act too smart, my boy.

253
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:51,691
Airbags like you love firing shots.

254
00:22:51,857 --> 00:22:55,024
Beating kids in the under
19 age group on steroids

255
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:58,482
You're wrinkling up, my boy

256
00:22:59,524 --> 00:23:00,982
Why don't you forget the
sport and fire shots while you can

257
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:04,774
You might never get
the good times back

258
00:23:05,691 --> 00:23:09,357
This time the chances of
you being selected are difficult.

259
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,774
You think you're cool, darling.

260
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:16,649
This friendship goes back 8 years.

261
00:23:17,024 --> 00:23:18,441
You can kid around. You're forgiven.

262
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:23,441
Tell me dear, how are you doing?

263
00:23:23,524 --> 00:23:25,191
I am doing well, brother.

264
00:23:25,274 --> 00:23:26,857
Swing by in the evening.

265
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:29,441
We'll shoot the shit.

266
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:32,191
He doesn't have time
for wastrels like you.

267
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:34,649
No problem brother,
I'll come in the evening for sure.

268
00:23:37,107 --> 00:23:39,399
Why do you waste your
time on these morons?

269
00:23:39,482 --> 00:23:40,649
Rocky stay in your limits.

270
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:42,316
We guys go way back

271
00:23:42,982 --> 00:23:44,149
I have some reputation over here.

272
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,182
Let him get beaten up.

273
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:56,474
He needs his dose.

274
00:24:12,557 --> 00:24:13,557
Bholu...

275
00:24:13,641 --> 00:24:16,224
Hey Bholu...

276
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:20,224
Why don't look away?

277
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:23,182
Hear me out.

278
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:28,099
Damn you, you just got slapped twice.

279
00:24:28,474 --> 00:24:29,682
It's not a big deal.

280
00:24:29,891 --> 00:24:33,016
You get beaten up
in the ring every day.

281
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:34,932
They were my cousins.

282
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,557
It was someone else,
I would've torn them apart.

283
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:38,641
Oh damn.

284
00:24:41,557 --> 00:24:42,474
Dhaiye, a little

285
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:46,224
My brother,
have at least a little shame.

286
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:48,557
You just got slapped.

287
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:50,182
What were your cousins saying?

288
00:24:50,266 --> 00:24:52,182
Just the usual.

289
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:55,932
My uncle's eldest
son is getting married.

290
00:24:56,182 --> 00:24:59,141
They asked me to come along.
- I said, get...

291
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:02,932
Now should I leave my training
to go dance at a wedding?

292
00:25:04,224 --> 00:25:05,807
Lazybones!

293
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:08,182
You are a no good boxer.

294
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:10,391
You eat the fruits
bought by the government.

295
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:12,266
Your hands are only
good to play cards.

296
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:13,849
What training are you going to miss?

297
00:25:14,016 --> 00:25:16,016
Make yourself useful sometimes.

298
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:17,474
Rimpy.
- Yes?

299
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,849
Get dressed.

300
00:25:19,182 --> 00:25:21,349
We have a wedding to attend.

301
00:25:21,391 --> 00:25:24,016
Come on, get up.

302
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:24,932
Let's go.

303
00:25:25,182 --> 00:25:25,724
Hey!

304
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:29,516
What are you playing?

305
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,849
Play what's trending these days.

306
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:35,307

307
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:38,474

308
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:56,016

309
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:00,349
"All will go bottoms up today."

310
00:26:08,057 --> 00:26:09,849
"All bottles will get uncorked today."

311
00:26:09,932 --> 00:26:11,557
"All will go bottoms up today."

312
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:13,432
"No one should interrupt."

313
00:26:13,516 --> 00:26:15,349
"No one should interrupt."

314
00:26:15,432 --> 00:26:17,849
"All the laws will be broken today."

315
00:26:17,932 --> 00:26:19,349
"It's my friend's wedding."

316
00:26:19,432 --> 00:26:21,349

00:26:28,974 --> 00:26:31,057
"It's my friend's wedding."

322
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,224
"It's a joyous occasion today."

323
00:26:42,307 --> 00:26:44,391
"We will party."

324
00:26:44,474 --> 00:26:46,099
"We won't fear anyone today."

325
00:26:46,182 --> 00:26:48,224
"We will drink and eat."

326
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:57,641
"It's a joyous occasion today."

327
00:26:57,724 --> 00:26:59,641
"We will party."

328
00:26:59,724 --> 00:27:01,557
"We won't fear anyone today."

329
00:27:01,641 --> 00:27:02,974
"We will drink and eat."

330
00:27:03,057 --> 00:27:05,182
"We will drink neat."

331
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:06,932
"We will have fun."

332
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:08,766
"No one should interrupt."

336
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:16,516
"It's my friend's wedding."

337
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,432
"It's my friend's wedding."

338
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:20,349
"It's my friend's wedding."

339
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,307
"It's my friend's wedding."

340
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,182
"It's my friend's wedding."

341
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:26,682
"It's my friend's wedding."

342
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,724
"My father feels proud today."

343
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:41,516
"My brother belongs to
my sister-in-law from today."

344
00:27:49,016 --> 00:27:52,724

"No one should interrupt."

"It's my friend's wedding."

354
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:13,682
"It's my friend's wedding."

355
00:28:13,766 --> 00:28:15,349
"It's my friend's wedding."

356
00:28:15,432 --> 00:28:17,474
"It's my friend's wedding."

357
00:28:17,557 --> 00:28:19,224
"It's my friend's wedding."

358
00:28:19,307 --> 00:28:21,349
"It's my friend's wedding."

359
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:23,016
"It's my friend's wedding."

360
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:25,182
"It's my friend's wedding."

361
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:26,932
"It's my friend's wedding."

362
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:28,682
"It's my friend's wedding."

363
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:30,557
"It's my friend's wedding."

364
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:33,557
"It's my friend's wedding."

365
00:28:35,057 --> 00:28:37,682
Sin! Grave sin!

366
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:40,932
I broke the vow I made to Goddess!

367
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:45,349
I considered you a brother, Rocky.

368
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:50,016
And you gave me alcohol
saying its lemonade.

369
00:28:50,391 --> 00:28:51,682
Goddess!

370
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:53,307
Goddess is calling.

371
00:28:53,724 --> 00:28:54,891
Preet!

372
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:56,349
Preet!

373
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:58,599
My blood pressure is dipping.

374
00:28:58,849 --> 00:29:00,599
It's plunging.

375
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:01,807
Catch it.

376
00:29:02,016 --> 00:29:03,432
Rimpy!

377
00:29:04,224 --> 00:29:05,224
Get the car

378
00:29:05,474 --> 00:29:07,724
You need to hook me up with glucose.

379
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:09,141
Take a banana.

380
00:29:09,224 --> 00:29:10,057
Banana!

381
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,307
Be a brother and slice it up for me.

382
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:14,682
The spice kit is in my bag.

383
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,766
Answer your phone, Rocky.

384
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:25,682
Who is calling that scoundrel
so early in the morning?

385
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,349
Hello, who is it?
WARYAM SINGH - DHAIYE

386
00:29:39,474 --> 00:29:40,557
Hello, sir.

387
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:42,016
Where's Rocky?

388
00:29:43,557 --> 00:29:45,849
He's here, sir. He has gone out.

389
00:29:45,974 --> 00:29:48,599
Waryam Singh tell him if he's
lost the desire to play for India,

390
00:29:48,682 --> 00:29:49,766
he should vacate the room ...

391
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:52,849
the government's not spending
it's money on his pleasure's

392
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:54,974
Okay, sir.

393
00:29:57,641 --> 00:29:59,016
Where's Rocky?

394
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:12,349
Sir, the wall had glass
pieces stuck on the top.

395
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:14,849
Go to the clinic
and get it stitched up.

396
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:16,766
Okay, sir.

397
00:31:27,682 --> 00:31:29,557
Your sister-in-law worries for you.

398
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:31,099
You should go meet her.

399
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,349
Get ready and come downstairs.

400
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:35,307
Youth party members
are waiting for you.

401
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:37,349
White garbs suits you, brother.

402
00:31:40,974 --> 00:31:42,516
Your sharp moustaches are good too.

403
00:31:43,432 --> 00:31:45,682
When you babble in
a fair before a crowd..

404
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:48,266
..you must be getting the
wrong impression of being in power.

405
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,766
I do politics.

406
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:54,016
I don't sulk in the room.

407
00:31:54,807 --> 00:31:58,307
He broke your face and my heart.

408
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:01,349
But we aren't going
to lose our mind over it.

409
00:32:01,391 --> 00:32:04,099
Let him soar high.

410
00:32:04,182 --> 00:32:08,057
You don't hunt in broad daylight.

411
00:32:08,682 --> 00:32:09,849
When the time is right...

412
00:32:10,974 --> 00:32:12,849
When the time is right...

413
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:15,641
I'll make him fall.

414
00:32:16,016 --> 00:32:17,266
Get ready and come downstairs.

415
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:19,599
Youth party members
are waiting for you.

416
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:35,266
Seerat, everyone is staring at you.

417
00:32:35,474 --> 00:32:38,391
Look at their eyes
and tell me what they say.

418
00:32:38,974 --> 00:32:41,182
Wait. You are so scared.

419
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:43,641
I express my feelings
and you think it's funny.

420
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:45,432
I don't.

421
00:32:45,516 --> 00:32:47,682
I like what you say.

422
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:51,474
Didn't your friends teach
you how to talk to girls?

423
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,557
You should be glad they haven't.

424
00:32:57,682 --> 00:32:59,516
Okay then let me teach you.

425
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:01,599
But you'll have to pay me fees, okay?

426
00:33:03,016 --> 00:33:07,849
Assume if a very
sweet and lovely girl..

427
00:33:08,016 --> 00:33:10,557
..asks you your opinion on her looks.

428
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:14,224
Then you should lightly blink and say:

429
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:18,099
"Seerat, I cannot look
away from your face."

430
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:21,682
"How can any words
be enough to define you?"

431
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:23,641
What rubbish.

432
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:26,641
Read the reply in my eyes.
How good is that!

433
00:33:27,516 --> 00:33:30,224
Now I believe for sure
that an idiot like you..

434
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:32,224
..didn't have any
girl as a friend before.

435
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,932
And he sulks again.

436
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:41,641
You get upset at the drop of a hat.

437
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:44,057
Don't you think you
have too much attitude?

438
00:33:45,016 --> 00:33:46,974
It only matches my beauty.

439
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:49,224
Come on preet.

440
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:54,099
From orchard to orchard
we go searching thee

441
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:58,016
our dearest rests in
a vineyard on a tender knee

442
00:33:58,099 --> 00:33:59,057
Keep quiet.

443
00:34:01,182 --> 00:34:04,057
Don't get heartbroken
because of this wrong belief.

444
00:34:04,224 --> 00:34:08,391
What you call an idiot
is loved by sportswomen.

445
00:34:08,724 --> 00:34:10,932
It's me who doesn't care for them.

446
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:17,391
Look at that peacock.

447
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:19,682
What a sample!

448
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,724
Let's go. We are getting late.
Are you done with your tea?

449
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:25,599
Wait, let me enjoy his dance.

450
00:34:27,516 --> 00:34:28,974
Preet! Preet!

451
00:34:29,432 --> 00:34:33,599
Let him go! You buffoon, let him go!

452
00:34:34,224 --> 00:34:37,724
Let him go! Someone help him!
They will kill this poor chap!

453
00:34:37,974 --> 00:34:39,224
No one will come to save him!

454
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:41,516
And they say Punjab
is full of brave people!

455
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,224
She's a firecracker!
- Let him go!

456
00:34:43,307 --> 00:34:45,141
I'll have to call the police.

457
00:34:49,474 --> 00:34:50,391
Get lost!

458
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,807
Hello, is this the police station?

459
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:56,057
I am calling from the University.

460
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:57,974
Wait, girl. My previous case is still
pending! - Give me my phone back!

461
00:34:58,057 --> 00:35:00,182
My previous case is still pending!
- Give me my phone back!

462
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,891
Give it back!

463
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:05,224
Stop staring and
at least call the cops!

464
00:35:05,307 --> 00:35:06,599
Don't you have any
humanity left in you?

465
00:35:06,682 --> 00:35:08,599
Drink your tea and coffee, guys.

466
00:35:08,682 --> 00:35:10,307
Sister is just blabbering.

467
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:11,891
I'll let you go but don't scream.

468
00:35:11,974 --> 00:35:12,891
I'll let you go but don't scream.

469
00:35:12,974 --> 00:35:14,849
Preet is my brother, you idiot.

470
00:35:15,432 --> 00:35:16,182
Thank you!

471
00:35:16,557 --> 00:35:21,307
He hit me, the rascal! - Dhaiya plead her
to stop! - Hit a poor helpless girl!

472
00:35:21,391 --> 00:35:23,974
Sister! Sister! Please don't.

473
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:26,391
Don't scream, police will come.
- You want to dance like a peacock now?

474
00:35:26,432 --> 00:35:28,182
Don't scream, police will come.

475
00:35:28,266 --> 00:35:29,474
There is a drought in the village.

476
00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:30,391
My family is ruined.

477
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,141
There are no fruits left to eat.

478
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,307
My brothers and nephews are starving.

479
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:36,307
All the fields are destroyed.

480
00:35:36,391 --> 00:35:37,557
All the animals are dead.

481
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:39,391
I am not lying.
I am just about to cry.

482
00:35:39,432 --> 00:35:42,474
You don't care about the place or
time, before acting yourself.

483
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,141
Listen to me.
- I'll teach you a lesson.

484
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:45,891
Preet, please listen to me.

485
00:35:45,974 --> 00:35:46,766
You never behave yourself.
- Please listen to me.

486
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:48,349
At least hear me out.
- You scoundrel...

487
00:35:48,432 --> 00:35:51,474
Preet! Listen to me.
You can vent your anger later.

488
00:35:51,557 --> 00:35:52,557
First hear me out.

489
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:55,266
You got a job at the railways, buddy.

490
00:35:55,391 --> 00:35:57,599
You got a job at the railways, Preet!

491
00:35:57,682 --> 00:35:59,474
I just met the director.

492
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:01,932
You've done it!

493
00:36:07,922 --> 00:36:10,214
May I have one more
cappuccino on my table please?

494
00:36:10,297 --> 00:36:10,714
Yes Maam

495
00:36:10,756 --> 00:36:12,256
I want...

496
00:36:16,422 --> 00:36:18,256
Do you sell beer as well?

497
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:20,756
No sir, just tea and coffee

498
00:36:20,922 --> 00:36:24,172
Tea and coffee is just isn't enough.

499
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:27,922
Beer drinkers seem
to be reining these days.

500
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:37,672
Can I have one more cake
that says sorry sent at that table?

501
00:36:37,714 --> 00:36:40,381
Watch out Preet, here I come.

502
00:36:40,672 --> 00:36:43,047
Isn't the peacock going
to peck at the cake?

503
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:45,381
He likes fruits.

504
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:49,006
He goes to market on
Friday to buy bananas and all.

505
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,089
Isn't she the same girl?

506
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,339
She's all dolled up today.

507
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:04,256
Did you inform your family?

508
00:37:04,464 --> 00:37:06,089
No, I didn't.

509
00:37:06,714 --> 00:37:08,631
You are heartless.

510
00:37:08,714 --> 00:37:10,214
Good news has come after a long time.

511
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:13,214
Your sister must have been
praying for her brother's job.

512
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:14,881
Go then I'll go and talk to them.

513
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:16,881
Yes, you go.

514
00:37:17,214 --> 00:37:18,672
We will wait for you.

515
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:21,047
You are the one who
has to cut the cake.

516
00:37:21,922 --> 00:37:23,047
Who is that girl?

517
00:37:26,464 --> 00:37:27,006
Who?

518
00:37:27,256 --> 00:37:29,214
The one who is "all dolled up."

519
00:37:30,006 --> 00:37:31,006
A friend.

520
00:37:31,172 --> 00:37:33,256
Our friend.
- Our?

521
00:37:34,756 --> 00:37:35,506
Yes.

522
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:36,922
Preet's.

523
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:38,756
What kind of a friend?

524
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,881
What do you mean what kind?

525
00:37:40,714 --> 00:37:43,089
Like us. Tea and coffee friend.

526
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:46,256
But she is urban.

527
00:37:52,547 --> 00:37:53,381
Let me tell you...

528
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:58,047
These modern ones like villagers.

529
00:37:59,006 --> 00:38:01,422
Preet is the reason
she became like that.

530
00:38:01,506 --> 00:38:02,922
She was quite dull before.

531
00:38:03,256 --> 00:38:04,964
Not good looking at all.

532
00:38:05,047 --> 00:38:05,964
Stop it.

533
00:38:06,214 --> 00:38:07,547
You are lying.

534
00:38:07,756 --> 00:38:10,589
Well if you don't
want to believe me then...

535
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,464
Sir maam has sent this for you

536
00:38:22,756 --> 00:38:24,631
Why is she saying sorry?

537
00:38:27,547 --> 00:38:28,839
Rocky!

538
00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:31,047
Why aren't you telling me?

539
00:38:32,714 --> 00:38:33,756
Tell me already!

540
00:38:34,672 --> 00:38:37,214
I am sorry I didn't believe you.

541
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:39,797
Rocky...

542
00:38:41,131 --> 00:38:44,006
Rocky, tell me, I am getting upset.

543
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:45,214
Listen to this, girl.

544
00:38:46,547 --> 00:38:48,089
Preet is naïve.

545
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:50,506
He has no bad habits.

546
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:54,547
I am telling you because
you are asking me.

547
00:38:56,214 --> 00:39:02,964
This girl and Preet... they
were together for 2-4 months.

548
00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:05,381
They were getting along well.

549
00:39:07,256 --> 00:39:12,589
Then Preet fell for someone else.

550
00:39:13,756 --> 00:39:15,131
Preet is honest.

551
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:18,964
Preet put his cards on the table.

552
00:39:20,047 --> 00:39:21,422
His cards were good.

553
00:39:22,672 --> 00:39:23,922
Now you tell me...

554
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,339
Can a two of clubs
match up with beauty..

555
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:33,172
god bless me

556
00:39:33,381 --> 00:39:37,172
With queen of shades?

557
00:39:39,214 --> 00:39:42,047
She lost it.

558
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:45,797
Look at this,
the tactics of a broken heart.

559
00:39:46,464 --> 00:39:50,256
Can you win over love
with cakes and patties?

560
00:39:53,547 --> 00:39:54,506
Take it take it.

561
00:39:54,964 --> 00:39:57,839
Set the witch right!

562
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:01,256
Get this straight.

563
00:40:01,547 --> 00:40:03,089
And remember it.

564
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,131
Your tactics won't work.

565
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:13,464
If you do such a thing again.
I'll use my sandals.

566
00:40:13,714 --> 00:40:15,131
Don't assume me to
be a rustic villager.

567
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,547
Rocky, you are a dog.

568
00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:32,547
Why, brother?

569
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:35,881
I am not my father's
son if I don't make you cry.

570
00:40:39,756 --> 00:40:42,964
Preet!
- Hey!

571
00:40:43,214 --> 00:40:44,256
Come here!

572
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:46,631
Come on, buddy! Preet!

573
00:40:46,714 --> 00:40:47,631
Hey!
- He gets upset so easily.

574
00:40:47,714 --> 00:40:48,881
That was my final's assignment.

575
00:40:48,964 --> 00:40:50,756
What did you tell that lunatic?

576
00:40:51,964 --> 00:40:53,006
Don't get hyper.

577
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:54,256
What's your problem?

578
00:40:54,547 --> 00:40:56,131
What nonsense was she talking about?

579
00:40:56,214 --> 00:40:57,631
What did you tell her about me?

580
00:40:57,714 --> 00:40:58,381
Get this straight.

581
00:40:59,547 --> 00:41:00,464
I don't know you.

582
00:41:00,797 --> 00:41:02,214
I met her today.

583
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:03,297
Handle your own matters on your own.

584
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:06,006
You think you are a star?

585
00:41:07,714 --> 00:41:09,422
You must be in your sports hostel.

586
00:41:09,631 --> 00:41:11,881
But I make the city dance to my tunes.

587
00:41:12,214 --> 00:41:13,756
Comparing notes, are we?

588
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,922
I am yet to seek revenge from you.

589
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:19,381
Use your attitude
towards those city chaps.

590
00:41:19,547 --> 00:41:22,047
Those softies might endure it.
I'll crush your arrogance brutally.

591
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:25,631
What my attitude,
alright, you're up then .

592
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:50,006
Tiggi! Tiggi!

593
00:42:54,006 --> 00:42:54,881
Come here, dear.

594
00:42:59,214 --> 00:43:00,839
Outsiders aren't allowed in here.

595
00:43:01,172 --> 00:43:01,714
I know.

596
00:43:01,922 --> 00:43:03,839
You need special
permission to play here.

597
00:43:03,922 --> 00:43:05,172
Do you have the permission?

598
00:43:05,881 --> 00:43:06,444
Yeah.

599
00:43:06,464 --> 00:43:07,547
Who gave you the permission?

600
00:43:08,047 --> 00:43:08,756
Rocky.

601
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:14,256
Rocky also said that I
could play here whenever I want.

602
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,797
No one will trouble me.

603
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:18,756
No, sir. I swear.

604
00:43:59,464 --> 00:44:05,672
"My love,
I don't look good, without you."

605
00:44:05,714 --> 00:44:11,672
"I am worthless, without you."

606
00:44:12,047 --> 00:44:18,297
"My love,
I don't look good, without you."

607
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:24,006
"I am worthless, without you."

608
00:44:24,172 --> 00:44:32,172
"God give an opportunity
to dream about you."

609
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:40,422
"Thank you for coming into my life."

610
00:44:40,506 --> 00:44:48,172
"Thank you for coming into my life."

611
00:44:58,506 --> 00:45:04,881
"You reside in my heart,
instead of the heartbeat."

612
00:45:04,964 --> 00:45:12,631
"I can live without breathing,
but I cannot survive without you."

613
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:20,547
"You reside in my heart,
instead of the heartbeat."

614
00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:27,381
"I can live without breathing,
but I cannot survive without you."

615
00:45:27,797 --> 00:45:34,672
"I never even thought
about living without you."

616
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:43,589
"Thank you for coming into my life."

617
00:45:43,672 --> 00:45:51,464
"Thank you for coming into my life."

618
00:46:14,506 --> 00:46:20,631
"Love flows in my veins, my love."

619
00:46:20,714 --> 00:46:23,631
"In my veins, my love."

620
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:30,089
"People worship God.
You are my God, my love."

621
00:46:30,172 --> 00:46:33,172
"You are my God, my love."

622
00:46:33,256 --> 00:46:39,381
"Love flows in my veins, my love."

623
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:46,589
"People worship God.
You are my God, my love."

624
00:46:46,672 --> 00:46:54,464
"I thank you for making me yours."

625
00:46:56,089 --> 00:47:02,339
"Thank you for coming into my life."

626
00:47:02,422 --> 00:47:10,047
"Thank you for coming into my life."

627
00:47:43,714 --> 00:47:44,297
How's it going?

628
00:47:44,589 --> 00:47:45,106
Hey!

629
00:47:45,464 --> 00:47:46,797
Going to your class on foot?

630
00:47:47,047 --> 00:47:48,506
Don't like cars anymore?

631
00:47:48,714 --> 00:47:49,756
Started liking walking more.

632
00:47:50,006 --> 00:47:52,797
It's a beautiful afternoon
so I thought I might as well...

633
00:47:53,797 --> 00:47:57,839
A beautiful afternoon
is better enjoyed in a car.

634
00:47:58,964 --> 00:47:59,797
Get in.

635
00:48:00,006 --> 00:48:01,756
No, I am happy being on foot.

636
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:03,214
What happened?

637
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,756
Rocky didn't even leave the
scope of us having a conversation?

638
00:48:07,381 --> 00:48:09,547
Shut up, loser.

639
00:48:11,797 --> 00:48:14,047
I met your parents last night.

640
00:48:14,631 --> 00:48:15,881
At Aman's wedding.

641
00:48:16,131 --> 00:48:17,381
Yeah, mom told me.

642
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:21,297
We spoke for quite some time.

643
00:48:22,506 --> 00:48:27,006
They were inquiring about you.

644
00:48:28,297 --> 00:48:34,631
Don't worry, I didn't
tell them anything about Rocky.

645
00:48:35,381 --> 00:48:36,672
What could I tell them?

646
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:40,756
He isn't even worthy of mention.

647
00:48:41,506 --> 00:48:47,214
Surviving on hostel's leftovers.
Worthless goon.

648
00:48:47,756 --> 00:48:50,339
Maninder, stop the car.

649
00:48:51,172 --> 00:48:52,256
Let me out.

650
00:48:54,797 --> 00:48:56,756
I said let me out.

651
00:48:59,089 --> 00:49:01,047
I have hidden your
misdirected desires.

652
00:49:01,131 --> 00:49:03,297
But get this straight.

653
00:49:03,506 --> 00:49:06,506
Storms only blind you with dirt.

654
00:49:07,172 --> 00:49:08,672
They don't caress foreheads.

655
00:49:21,547 --> 00:49:24,339
Come on! Up . Come on.
- Rocky!

656
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:26,506
Rocky!

657
00:49:30,589 --> 00:49:31,797
Do you want to hurt him for real?

658
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:33,631
Come here!
- Move!

659
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:37,464
Baljeet, are you hurt?

660
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:19,464
I've tried every trick
in the book with you.

661
00:50:21,672 --> 00:50:24,422
I feel like I'm banging
my head against a wall.

662
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,797
But you just aren't concerned.

663
00:50:30,047 --> 00:50:35,422
Selectors are being pressured into
not selecting you for Commonwealth.

664
00:50:38,756 --> 00:50:43,172
If they see you behaving
wild and out of control like this..

665
00:50:44,172 --> 00:50:46,089
.they'll throw you out immediately

666
00:50:48,256 --> 00:50:51,339
I have always ignored
your crazy antics.

667
00:50:51,922 --> 00:50:53,256
But you don't seem
to want to mend your ways.

668
00:50:57,131 --> 00:51:02,339
If the limitations of the
sport suffocate you, you can leave.

669
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:06,047
You have a reputation as a hooligan.

670
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,631
Your employer will
quote a good price for you.

671
00:51:16,756 --> 00:51:18,381
Coach, I need your advice.

672
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,422
From the time I
got busy with the camp..

673
00:51:23,506 --> 00:51:25,297
..Preet has gotte closer to Devinder.

674
00:51:26,297 --> 00:51:28,006
He seems to be getting
influenced by him.

675
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:29,339
He isn't listening to me.

676
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:32,756
And you know how Devinder is.

677
00:51:36,964 --> 00:51:39,047
It's new for him.
He has just moved out of your shadow.

678
00:51:40,422 --> 00:51:41,839
Wants to be his own man.

679
00:51:42,131 --> 00:51:43,422
I know Preet well.

680
00:51:44,589 --> 00:51:45,714
He is a sweet kid.

681
00:51:46,214 --> 00:51:47,714
He's a foolish kid.

682
00:51:48,422 --> 00:51:50,006
He doesn't know what's
good or bad for him.

683
00:51:51,631 --> 00:51:53,672
He isn't hotheaded like you.

684
00:51:55,131 --> 00:51:56,131
He will listen to me.

685
00:51:56,422 --> 00:51:57,631
Ask him to meet me.

686
00:52:00,464 --> 00:52:03,631
It's a good thought
to console the heart, Ghalib.

687
00:52:07,714 --> 00:52:10,922
Commonwealth team's final
selection takes place next week.

688
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:14,006
Rajdeep...

689
00:52:15,922 --> 00:52:23,047
The glory you seek hides
in your shadow somewhere..

690
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:27,256
Don't get consumed
by the fire of your demons

691
00:52:28,756 --> 00:52:31,714
Let the fire be your
guiding light, Rajdeep.

692
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:20,854
What are you thinking about?

693
00:53:21,854 --> 00:53:23,146
Can you answer.

694
00:53:23,313 --> 00:53:23,771
Nothing.

695
00:53:25,396 --> 00:53:27,354
Why do you hide everything from me?

696
00:53:27,854 --> 00:53:30,146
Why do you have to
dig deep into everything?

697
00:53:30,479 --> 00:53:31,979
I am a psychology student.

698
00:53:32,063 --> 00:53:33,354
It's in my nature.

699
00:53:33,688 --> 00:53:34,854
Can I ask something?

700
00:53:35,354 --> 00:53:36,604
Don't if you can help it.

701
00:53:36,688 --> 00:53:39,021
University students
have a nickname for you.

702
00:53:39,104 --> 00:53:40,604
I don't like it.

703
00:53:41,479 --> 00:53:42,521
You can call me Rajdeep.

704
00:53:43,188 --> 00:53:44,313
No, it's soemthing else.

705
00:53:44,896 --> 00:53:46,104
Mental?

706
00:53:46,438 --> 00:53:47,604
Why do they call you that?

707
00:53:51,188 --> 00:53:52,271
Who are they?

708
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,479
Devotees.

709
00:54:05,396 --> 00:54:07,396
There's work.
You need to come with.

710
00:54:07,729 --> 00:54:09,771
Learn to fight your own battles.

711
00:54:09,854 --> 00:54:12,063
I'm not kidding around.
It's serious.

712
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:14,771
What are you driving
around this mob for?

713
00:54:15,146 --> 00:54:17,521
Ruin their lives as well.

714
00:54:17,688 --> 00:54:19,104
Stop it, Rocky.

715
00:54:19,479 --> 00:54:21,479
Bikram and 30-35 of his goons
are waiting for us.

716
00:54:23,104 --> 00:54:25,354
I had warned you to
stay away from Preet !

717
00:54:25,521 --> 00:54:26,396
Rocky!

718
00:54:27,729 --> 00:54:30,854
He doesn't play on my command.

719
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:33,854
Our friendship goes back 8 years.

720
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,313
He is true to it.

721
00:54:35,396 --> 00:54:37,688
You've survived on
my alms these 8 years.

722
00:54:38,104 --> 00:54:39,813
It all ends today.

723
00:54:40,438 --> 00:54:42,396
Time you find a new master.

724
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:45,646
The curse of the feminine
touch softens one up.

725
00:54:46,438 --> 00:54:47,771
Has she made you vow not to.

726
00:54:47,854 --> 00:54:48,854
Let me handle this, brother.

727
00:54:48,938 --> 00:54:51,396
Look Rocky,
be a brother and come along today.

728
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:54,354
Only today.
We will teach him a lesson today.

729
00:54:54,438 --> 00:54:55,604
We will never ask you to do it again.

730
00:54:55,688 --> 00:54:58,271
Not today, not anymore, Preet.

731
00:54:58,354 --> 00:55:02,646
Enmity isn't a lover you can
play with and then let go, Rocky.

732
00:55:02,813 --> 00:55:06,354
You marry your enmity and
stay faithful to it for eternity.

733
00:55:06,521 --> 00:55:10,396
If abandoned, enmity will vengefully
eliminate you and carry on.

734
00:55:10,896 --> 00:55:11,938
Let's go, Preet.

735
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:13,438
Preet's not going.

736
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:16,896
Rocky, let go of my hand.

737
00:55:17,396 --> 00:55:19,104
It's clear how much you care about me.

738
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:21,688
Rajdeep Singh Dhaliwal.

739
00:55:21,854 --> 00:55:23,604
Envious of your friends courage?

740
00:55:24,063 --> 00:55:26,479
You always kept him under your shoes.

741
00:55:26,813 --> 00:55:28,688
Let him sprout up for once.

742
00:55:28,771 --> 00:55:31,146
You pit one of yours against
two of Vikram's.

743
00:55:31,438 --> 00:55:32,646
You might just triumph.

744
00:55:33,146 --> 00:55:34,854
If you want to combat
me then let's go.

745
00:55:39,938 --> 00:55:41,104
Rocky, let go of my hand.

746
00:55:41,813 --> 00:55:42,646
Let go of my hand.

747
00:55:42,938 --> 00:55:44,229
Stop trying to be my parent!

748
00:55:44,396 --> 00:55:45,354
Rocky, behave.

749
00:55:45,563 --> 00:55:46,604
Let Preet go.

750
00:55:46,896 --> 00:55:47,688
Let him go.

751
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:51,938
If you're going to make
me beg I can grab your feet.

752
00:55:55,604 --> 00:55:57,521
Stop blowing the trumpet
on our friendship.

753
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,313
I'm not dancing to your tunes anymore.

754
00:56:05,354 --> 00:56:07,271
Rocky, Preet isn't a kid.

755
00:56:07,438 --> 00:56:09,063
You should behave with him properly.

756
00:56:09,479 --> 00:56:11,063
And I am not your boyfriend.

757
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:13,521
Don't make any claims on me.

758
00:56:20,271 --> 00:56:22,271
He loves you.

759
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,313
He is crazy.

760
00:56:26,854 --> 00:56:28,563
But he can die for you.

761
00:56:29,104 --> 00:56:30,021
And I won't?

762
00:56:32,229 --> 00:56:33,979
But today he insulted me.

763
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:38,604
How are you doing, boxer?

764
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:42,104
You have tears in your eyes.

765
00:56:42,604 --> 00:56:43,854
All good?

766
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:49,063
He sometimes throws
punches in the wind.

767
00:56:49,604 --> 00:56:51,938
Sometimes wipes tears with his fists.

768
00:56:52,396 --> 00:56:54,979
What kind of boxer is he?

769
00:56:56,188 --> 00:56:57,979
You don't take a punch to your face!

770
00:56:58,229 --> 00:56:59,896
You blabbermouth!

771
00:57:00,146 --> 00:57:01,646
Oh my!

772
00:57:01,896 --> 00:57:05,563
The firecracker just pierced my heart.

773
00:57:08,938 --> 00:57:12,438
Hey, why are you troubling him?

774
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:17,646
It's a shame.
His brother doesn't even sigh.

775
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:22,438
Mind you, she the tail's wandered
into the fair without the dog.

776
00:57:22,688 --> 00:57:27,563
He's a national boxing star.
He considers him nothing.

777
00:57:31,771 --> 00:57:36,938
Do you have any money in
your pocket to spend at the fair?

778
00:57:37,146 --> 00:57:38,271
Shut up, will you?

779
00:57:38,563 --> 00:57:40,146
He is a senior officer
in the railways.

780
00:57:40,604 --> 00:57:42,479
Look at his pride.

781
00:58:10,646 --> 00:58:12,146
What, you got the fleas?

782
00:58:12,521 --> 00:58:14,563
I need to teach someone a lesson.

783
00:58:14,729 --> 00:58:16,188
Maninder Shergill.

784
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:23,146
Learn to fight your own battles.

785
00:58:23,229 --> 00:58:25,646
I have nothing to
do with Rocky anymore.

786
00:58:26,104 --> 00:58:28,438
You have always been his lapdog.

787
00:58:28,896 --> 00:58:29,938
You can ask him one more time.

788
00:58:30,021 --> 00:58:32,271
I have also always stood by you.

789
00:58:32,563 --> 00:58:33,521
Oh really?

790
00:58:34,021 --> 00:58:35,813
Today you were clinging to his pinky?

791
00:58:39,021 --> 00:58:40,729
Don't make me beg.

792
00:58:41,646 --> 00:58:42,646
Stand by me today.

793
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:45,104
And I'll owe you my life.

794
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,354
Our friendship goes back 8 years.

795
00:58:47,438 --> 00:58:49,354
So should I carry
you around in my arms?

796
00:58:49,813 --> 00:58:53,646
If you have the courage then take the
gun from my room and shoot him down.

797
00:58:54,354 --> 00:58:56,188
Don't weep like a girl.

798
00:58:56,979 --> 00:58:59,938
Falcons don't flutter
around screeching

799
00:58:59,979 --> 00:59:02,563
Falcons catch their
prey by their skulls

800
00:59:03,021 --> 00:59:05,479
Don't end up just
growling like your friend.

801
00:59:06,104 --> 00:59:08,938
You've got to have a bite too.

802
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:11,604
You've rebelled from my orders?

803
00:59:12,354 --> 00:59:15,604
I haven't. Preet has.

804
00:59:16,063 --> 00:59:18,396
He left the company
of dogs and joined a pack of wolves.

805
00:59:19,938 --> 00:59:23,063
I would have invited you too
but you are too damn cold.

806
00:59:23,771 --> 00:59:26,896
And the fire inside you
has been extinguished with love.

807
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:30,688
Winter's upon us, Romeo,
and you're all abandoned and cold.. .

808
00:59:31,938 --> 00:59:33,354
but we will offer you alms

809
00:59:33,438 --> 00:59:36,854
We will give you a
much needed dose of manhood

810
00:59:44,563 --> 00:59:47,188
You get into action
when you get targeted, huh?

811
00:59:48,396 --> 00:59:49,729
Preet, what is this childishness?

812
00:59:49,813 --> 00:59:50,854
You are my life.

813
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:53,688
Your obstinacy is manliness.

814
00:59:54,688 --> 00:59:56,229
And my obstinacy is childishness?

815
00:59:56,771 --> 00:59:57,896
My future belongs to you?

816
00:59:58,104 --> 00:59:59,063
My past belongs to you?

817
00:59:59,146 --> 01:00:01,313
Decisions, friendships,
you have a right over everything?

818
01:00:02,854 --> 01:00:04,771
At least let my life be my own.

819
01:00:05,563 --> 01:00:07,938
don't take away my
right to live it or end it

820
01:00:10,896 --> 01:00:11,688
Preet...

821
01:00:12,354 --> 01:00:12,896
Preet...

822
01:00:14,646 --> 01:00:15,354
Preet...

823
01:00:26,188 --> 01:00:26,896
Preet...

824
01:00:29,104 --> 01:00:32,063
Preet! Please open the door.

825
01:00:33,271 --> 01:00:34,771
Preet Listen to me.
Atleast hear me out.

826
01:00:44,396 --> 01:00:47,979
Waryam Singh Sekhon who was recently
appointed as the Indian boxing Coach today

827
01:00:48,063 --> 01:00:55,313
turned in his resignation when his name
sprung up in a disturbing doping racket ...

828
01:00:55,479 --> 01:01:01,396
the substances in question were banned
by the National Doping agency in 2008 ...

829
01:01:01,479 --> 01:01:04,938
Waryam Singh Sekhon
has been found guilty in a

830
01:01:05,021 --> 01:01:08,104
doping scandal that rocked
the Indian boxing federation today ...

831
01:01:08,438 --> 01:01:10,396
the banned substances
would be ordered from Malaysia

832
01:01:10,479 --> 01:01:14,604
and would be mixed into the diet of
some unsuspecting favoured athletes ...

833
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:18,313
ANSI is yet to come out
with an official statement ...

834
01:01:22,063 --> 01:01:23,396
He is not at the stadium.

835
01:01:24,271 --> 01:01:25,771
He isn't answering his phone either.

836
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:30,521
Is he romancing with that girl?

837
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,146
Go, check his room.

838
01:01:39,438 --> 01:01:40,438
Rocky, are you alright?

839
01:01:46,938 --> 01:01:47,563
Hey.

840
01:01:51,938 --> 01:01:52,771
Hi.

841
01:01:55,854 --> 01:01:56,979
Joker.

842
01:02:02,354 --> 01:02:03,146
What's up?

843
01:02:04,896 --> 01:02:05,646
Ready to rumble?

844
01:02:07,896 --> 01:02:08,646
What happened?

845
01:02:11,938 --> 01:02:13,396
What happened, Rocky?

846
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,396
They aren't keeping me in team India.

847
01:02:15,854 --> 01:02:17,146
What do you mean by
they aren't keeping you?

848
01:02:17,229 --> 01:02:19,063
The final selection is yet to be done.

849
01:02:19,313 --> 01:02:19,979
I won't be selected.

850
01:02:20,854 --> 01:02:22,021
Who told you that?

851
01:02:24,854 --> 01:02:27,313
Okay, don't be sad
over such a small thing.

852
01:02:27,729 --> 01:02:29,188
I'll get you selected.

853
01:02:30,479 --> 01:02:31,146
Okay?

854
01:02:31,938 --> 01:02:33,146
I know the sports minister.

855
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:33,854
I'll talk to him.

856
01:02:34,521 --> 01:02:36,646
I don't need your charity.

857
01:02:41,021 --> 01:02:43,021
I am not doing you a favor.

858
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,688
I just wanna help.

859
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:47,563
Do I stand in askance.

860
01:02:48,271 --> 01:02:51,521
You are India's best
boxer in your weight category.

861
01:02:51,729 --> 01:02:53,979
You have the right
to play in the team.

862
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:58,229
If you get selected, what difference
does it make how you got selected?

863
01:02:58,396 --> 01:03:00,146
Right's aren't passed
around in chariy .

864
01:03:00,771 --> 01:03:01,479
We done?

865
01:03:01,813 --> 01:03:05,938
Listen I'm not Preet who'll quietly
listen to whatever you say.

866
01:03:06,229 --> 01:03:09,146
Do whatever you want to,
see what I care.

867
01:03:12,979 --> 01:03:18,604
Listen, I'm sorry but it
gets so hard to get through to you.

868
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:21,604
I was just trying to...

869
01:03:21,896 --> 01:03:23,896
Ibaadat, i am sorry.

870
01:03:25,354 --> 01:03:28,229
I didn't purposely,
Ibaadat, Don't you dare come near me,

871
01:03:28,313 --> 01:03:35,021
don't, touch me, leave, leave

872
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:36,479
Both players come forward.

873
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:38,521
No hitting below the belt.

874
01:03:38,938 --> 01:03:39,979
No clinching.

875
01:03:40,438 --> 01:03:41,521
I want a clean fight.

876
01:03:41,979 --> 01:03:42,604
Okay?

877
01:03:56,063 --> 01:04:01,396
Life isn't the time
you spend inside the ring.

878
01:04:03,771 --> 01:04:06,104
Life isn't a game outside the ring.

879
01:04:07,104 --> 01:04:09,771
Life sometimes makes you lose.

880
01:04:11,104 --> 01:04:12,896
No matter how prepared you are.

881
01:04:13,354 --> 01:04:17,313
Defeat is important
in the game of life.

882
01:04:19,729 --> 01:04:21,438
Defeat teaches you how to win.

883
01:04:22,979 --> 01:04:29,104
Rajdeep, you are one of
the best boxers in the country.

884
01:04:31,479 --> 01:04:33,396
But you won't get selected, son.

885
01:05:15,938 --> 01:05:21,896
You should always behave
like an India level sportsman.

886
01:05:23,271 --> 01:05:25,938
A novice's carelessness
doesn't suit you.

887
01:05:29,729 --> 01:05:35,021
People want... to see you fall.

888
01:05:39,604 --> 01:05:41,438
Don't fall, son.

889
01:07:09,396 --> 01:07:10,979
Rocky!

890
01:08:21,729 --> 01:08:22,979
No!

891
01:08:23,063 --> 01:08:24,938
Preet!

892
01:08:30,229 --> 01:08:33,438
Preet!

893
01:09:03,146 --> 01:09:06,104
Rocky, our brother is dead.

894
01:09:17,771 --> 01:09:19,479
'I am not my father's
son if I don't make you cry.'

895
01:09:24,188 --> 01:09:26,229
Preet!

896
01:09:26,813 --> 01:09:30,479
He was as dear to me as he was to you.

897
01:09:30,503 --> 01:09:31,303
Why have you left me, complaints
grievances are both a part of life

898
01:10:32,986 --> 01:10:34,736
I don't want to go to the police.

899
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:36,320
Drop me home.

900
01:10:37,153 --> 01:10:38,861
Shouldn't I leave
you with Rocky instead?

901
01:10:45,236 --> 01:10:46,111
Ma'am?

902
01:10:47,486 --> 01:10:48,653
What's the boy's name?

903
01:10:48,736 --> 01:10:49,195
Rocky.

904
01:10:51,445 --> 01:10:52,278
Rocky who?

905
01:10:52,861 --> 01:10:53,986
Mental.

906
01:10:57,570 --> 01:10:58,903
Go wait in the car.

907
01:11:02,236 --> 01:11:04,695
I don't have the status
to reason it with the minister.

908
01:11:04,903 --> 01:11:06,153
But if you could reconsider?

909
01:11:06,445 --> 01:11:07,945
This is just bringing
in trouble to yourself.

910
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,903
You don't have the status
to giving me advice either.

911
01:11:11,986 --> 01:11:15,195
Do your job. Don't try to be a lawyer.

912
01:11:32,278 --> 01:11:36,653
Rocky, everything in
life is falling into place.

913
01:11:37,653 --> 01:11:40,111
I sometimes fear that
someone might ruin it all.

914
01:11:41,778 --> 01:11:44,111
Forget fearing that.

915
01:11:45,611 --> 01:11:47,528
You forget that I can die for you.

916
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:51,778
I convinced Seerat to marry me.

917
01:11:52,153 --> 01:11:53,236
That foolish girl?

918
01:11:53,528 --> 01:11:54,903
She is so talkative.

919
01:11:54,945 --> 01:11:56,486
Don't say a word about her.

920
01:11:58,945 --> 01:12:00,361
You two would look good together.

921
01:12:00,903 --> 01:12:03,236
Squirel and kitten.

922
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:06,570
After commonwealth,
you will be a star in India.

923
01:12:07,695 --> 01:12:09,778
Will you attend your
ordinary friend's wedding?

924
01:12:10,778 --> 01:12:14,195
I'll go to Bholu's uncle's
younger son's wedding too.

925
01:12:14,653 --> 01:12:16,070
These tears weep their
testimonies of our love

926
01:12:16,153 --> 01:12:18,195
I'll go to the grave with you,
sweetheart.

927
01:12:19,986 --> 01:12:25,736
If you would have ordered
I would have given my life for you

928
01:12:26,028 --> 01:12:31,736
But would have never
let you walk out of mine

929
01:12:32,236 --> 01:12:37,820
If you would have ordered
I would have given my life for you

930
01:12:38,403 --> 01:12:44,278
But would have never
let you walk out of mine

931
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:06,195
Why have you left me, complaints
grievances are both a part of life

932
01:13:06,278 --> 01:13:13,028
Losing a beloved permanently
casts a morbid restlessness in life

933
01:13:18,778 --> 01:13:24,653
Why have you left me, complaints
grievances are both a part of life

934
01:13:24,736 --> 01:13:30,903
Losing a beloved permanently
casts a morbid restlessness in life

935
01:13:31,028 --> 01:13:34,070
You had said you would
always be by my side

936
01:13:34,153 --> 01:13:37,070
You lost your word today

937
01:13:37,153 --> 01:13:42,903
These tears weep their
testimonies of our love

938
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:48,945
Why was your friendship so short lived

939
01:13:49,028 --> 01:13:54,403
I would have never
let you walk out of my life

940
01:13:55,153 --> 01:14:00,945
If you would have ordered
I would have given my life for you

941
01:14:01,486 --> 01:14:07,903
But would have never
let you walk out of mine

942
01:14:37,778 --> 01:14:39,611
If breaking iron at the gym

943
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:43,361
..and consuming protein supplements
had the minutest relevance in life..

944
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:46,153
..all the influential people
in our area would decorate..

945
01:14:46,236 --> 01:14:49,945
..you with laurels and
get pictures clicked with you.

946
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:52,528
But if someone asks you to
get on a tractor and split an acre

947
01:14:52,611 --> 01:14:56,653
..in half you would drive
my name into the ground.

948
01:14:57,153 --> 01:14:58,195
To avenge you, Get to it

949
01:14:58,736 --> 01:15:02,153
I had removed all possible obstacles.

950
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:05,570
I would've made the person
who spilled Shergill's blood..

951
01:15:05,736 --> 01:15:07,736
..bleed to death drop by drop.

952
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:10,903
But you don't trust your
brother's promises anymore.

953
01:15:11,695 --> 01:15:13,445
If you wanted to do it the crude way..

954
01:15:13,528 --> 01:15:15,236
..then why did you
make me call the SSP?

955
01:15:15,903 --> 01:15:19,111
You should've taken God's
name and gone for the kill inside the boxing ring itself.

956
01:15:44,445 --> 01:15:45,695
You crossed my instruction.

957
01:15:48,486 --> 01:15:50,445
We didn't talk about killing Rocky.

958
01:15:51,028 --> 01:15:54,736
He was as dear to me as he was to you.

959
01:16:10,528 --> 01:16:11,736
You...

960
01:16:15,945 --> 01:16:18,445
Have a taste of gold, dear.

961
01:16:19,111 --> 01:16:21,361
Our friendship lasted 8 years.

962
01:16:24,986 --> 01:16:28,736
I don't think you are well
versed with politics, Mr. Shergill.

963
01:16:29,195 --> 01:16:31,820
You shouldn't pamper
your subjects too much ...

964
01:16:31,903 --> 01:16:33,195
they get reckless.

965
01:16:33,528 --> 01:16:35,945
Slaving the reckless is child's play.

966
01:16:36,528 --> 01:16:37,820
And not the problem.

967
01:16:39,111 --> 01:16:44,403
The problem is finding an apt punishment
for subjects who dare steal their ruler's prey

968
01:16:45,903 --> 01:16:49,653
These threats can only scare
your party workers, Mr. Shergill.

969
01:16:49,986 --> 01:16:52,778
City bred kids
cannot control wild bulls.

970
01:16:53,278 --> 01:16:55,903
And you should worry
about your position and power.

971
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:58,736
I wiped my enemies
name from the headlines.

972
01:16:59,195 --> 01:17:01,695
Now the law and the
media will get involved.

973
01:17:01,903 --> 01:17:03,611
To find the murderers.

974
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:07,445
Be alert, Mr. Shergill.

975
01:17:07,945 --> 01:17:09,986
Don't be so careless this time.

976
01:17:19,195 --> 01:17:23,070
Your garb looks wrinkled.
You should keep it starched.

977
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:04,070
I'm glad you came.

978
01:18:09,403 --> 01:18:10,570
I was just about to leave.

979
01:18:38,236 --> 01:18:38,903
Rocky...

980
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:54,486
Hey stupid...

981
01:18:55,153 --> 01:18:58,903
This is an Indian star's life.

982
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,111
It won't give up that easy.

983
01:19:12,986 --> 01:19:14,153
Preet...

984
01:20:28,278 --> 01:20:31,153
He's been charged with attempting
to rape a university student.

985
01:20:31,611 --> 01:20:35,861
When the girl tried to stop Rocky,
he brutally attacked her.

986
01:20:36,195 --> 01:20:39,778
An inspiration for Punjab's
youth has shamed all Punjabis today.

987
01:20:39,903 --> 01:20:43,820
Rocky, do you regret what you did?

988
01:20:48,736 --> 01:20:52,236
Share your thoughts
with the people of Punjab.

989
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,695
They trusted you
and you betrayed them.

990
01:20:54,861 --> 01:20:58,486
What relationship did you
have with the girl you tried to rape?

991
01:20:58,986 --> 01:21:00,861
Boxer, gangster or a rapist.

992
01:21:00,903 --> 01:21:03,236
Which character is
ruling you at the movement?

993
01:21:09,111 --> 01:21:13,611
Is this deed a result of illegal
drugs given by Waryam Singh Sekhon?

994
01:21:13,778 --> 01:21:15,111
Rocky?

995
01:21:15,195 --> 01:21:16,153
Rocky, say something.

996
01:21:16,236 --> 01:21:17,195
Rocky? - Rocky, say something.

997
01:21:17,486 --> 01:21:18,820
Rocky, please?

998
01:21:20,528 --> 01:21:24,486
Our ancestors would say that man can brave
storms riding on the shoulders of calamity,..

999
01:21:24,570 --> 01:21:27,153
..and in his determination
even stand up to the gods.

1000
01:21:27,611 --> 01:21:30,528
Mr. Inderpal,
everyone faces difficult times.

1001
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:32,570
You shouldn't lose courage.

1002
01:21:32,695 --> 01:21:35,278
But what courage can one conjour when
your children are in such darkness?

1003
01:21:36,445 --> 01:21:38,945
Parents become helpless.

1004
01:21:39,445 --> 01:21:41,861
Ibadat doesn't say anything.

1005
01:21:42,528 --> 01:21:44,695
She just cries inside her locked room.

1006
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:49,403
Consider my concern legitimate, Mr.
Shergill.

1007
01:21:50,861 --> 01:21:53,486
When even close relatives
are trying to avoid us..

1008
01:21:53,945 --> 01:21:57,278
..you have come forth
with a marriage proposal.

1009
01:21:58,111 --> 01:22:03,861
We cannot take any decision
without talking to Ibadat first.

1010
01:22:04,736 --> 01:22:06,070
Ibadat?

1011
01:22:09,403 --> 01:22:09,986
Ibadat?

1012
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:11,028
Ibadat?

1013
01:22:15,486 --> 01:22:16,528
What's wrong with you?

1014
01:22:16,861 --> 01:22:22,070
Mr. Shergill,
I apologize for my daughter's mistake.

1015
01:22:22,528 --> 01:22:25,111
Sit down, child. Sit down.

1016
01:22:35,986 --> 01:22:36,695
Maninder?

1017
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:41,570
Son, I don't know what's
going on between the two of you.

1018
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:43,986
The glorious heritage of my forefathers
is going to be inherited by this wimp.

1019
01:22:45,486 --> 01:22:51,820
Getting punched and
slapped gives him kicks.

1020
01:22:55,486 --> 01:22:56,903
You're daughters here.

1021
01:22:57,153 --> 01:22:58,528
It's important to address all concerns

1022
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:01,695
To decipher the illegitimate
from the legitimate.

1023
01:23:03,403 --> 01:23:07,111
And to critically consider
the illegitimate one's

1024
01:23:08,695 --> 01:23:11,986
Then we will get her
engaged to my little brother.

1025
01:23:19,445 --> 01:23:20,528
Sign here.

1026
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:29,403
Prisoner's name?

1027
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:30,736
Rajdeep Singh.

1028
01:23:30,903 --> 01:23:32,528
Rajdeep...

1029
01:23:32,611 --> 01:23:33,486
Rocky.

1030
01:23:35,195 --> 01:23:36,236
He is a boxer.

1031
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:43,486
He's just come to his in-law's
a mere four days ago.

1032
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:46,278
Let the family at least
celebrate their rituals.

1033
01:23:47,528 --> 01:23:50,445
Sometimes his mother shows up,
sometimes his grandfather.

1034
01:23:51,361 --> 01:23:54,070
Heed my advice and scram from here.

1035
01:23:54,611 --> 01:23:56,070
He won't meet anyone.

1036
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:57,820
We have passed on many messages.

1037
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:59,153
Go away!

1038
01:24:19,486 --> 01:24:25,528
If you would have ordered
I would have given my life for you

1039
01:24:25,695 --> 01:24:32,028
But would have never
let you walk out of mine

1040
01:24:53,736 --> 01:24:59,736
I would happily spill my blood for you

1041
01:24:59,903 --> 01:25:06,403
Your memories rattle me,
I cry day and night

1042
01:25:12,195 --> 01:25:18,028
I would happily spill my blood for you

1043
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:24,236
Your memories rattle me,
I cry day and night

1044
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:30,361
To whose stubbornness
will I bow my head now

1045
01:25:30,611 --> 01:25:36,320
This encounter of
breaths ends here I guess

1046
01:25:36,403 --> 01:25:42,403
Whose friendship will I turn to now

1047
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:48,445
I would have never
let you walk out of my life

1048
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:54,611
If you would have ordered
I would have given my life for you

1049
01:25:54,903 --> 01:26:00,778
But would have never
let you walk out of mine

1050
01:26:01,028 --> 01:26:06,986
If you would have ordered
I would have given my life for you

1051
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:13,111
But would have never
let you walk out of mine

1052
01:26:13,361 --> 01:26:19,111
But would have never
let you walk out of mine

1053
01:26:19,445 --> 01:26:23,528
Why did you not order me to

1054
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:54,278
What nonsense are you up to?

1055
01:26:59,236 --> 01:27:00,070
Brother...

1056
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:05,986
We were just fooling around,
playing tailing the monkey.

1057
01:27:07,445 --> 01:27:09,153
Should I turn you into a monkey?

1058
01:27:12,153 --> 01:27:13,111
No, brother.

1059
01:27:13,278 --> 01:27:16,195
Today... it's Gagan's turn.

1060
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,986
Brother is here. Be ready.

1061
01:27:22,653 --> 01:27:26,986
Yes, I am here only
to make fun of, right?

1062
01:27:27,486 --> 01:27:31,736
Brother,
if you could take Frooti along...?

1063
01:27:39,236 --> 01:27:40,778
There's one more option.

1064
01:27:42,945 --> 01:27:44,320
There's a new scapegoat.

1065
01:27:44,486 --> 01:27:45,445
Let's use him.

1066
01:27:51,153 --> 01:27:52,403
He's a rapist.

1067
01:27:53,070 --> 01:27:55,070
We'll enjoy devouring him.

1068
01:27:55,278 --> 01:27:57,861
He's tall and well built.

1069
01:27:58,028 --> 01:27:59,820
Let's turn him into a monkey.

1070
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:01,986
Should I turn you into a monkey?

1071
01:28:05,486 --> 01:28:07,111
Let's go already.

1072
01:28:07,945 --> 01:28:10,361
Hey NO.

1073
01:28:23,585 --> 01:28:26,043
Do you feel the heat, champion?

1074
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:28,876
Yes come again.

1075
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:29,751
Really?

1076
01:28:32,876 --> 01:28:36,626
"He has caught the bug!"

1077
01:28:52,626 --> 01:28:53,960
God bless you.

1078
01:28:54,876 --> 01:28:56,918
He's caught his eye.

1079
01:28:57,501 --> 01:28:58,501
It's his turn now.

1080
01:28:58,876 --> 01:29:02,001
And I always await heaven.

1081
01:29:49,251 --> 01:29:52,626
Brother, don't you
think it's getting too trashy here?

1082
01:29:56,793 --> 01:29:57,835
Lift your hooves!

1083
01:29:58,710 --> 01:30:02,835
Why do you ask him?
Hit it hard and move ahead.

1084
01:30:08,876 --> 01:30:10,043
Nonsense.

1085
01:30:13,085 --> 01:30:14,293
'Rocky, let go of my hand.'

1086
01:30:14,918 --> 01:30:16,293
Stop trying to be my parent

1087
01:30:17,293 --> 01:30:19,626
Stop blowing the trumpet
on our friendship

1088
01:30:20,626 --> 01:30:22,460
I'm not dancing to your tunes anymore

1089
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:23,751
Preet, what is this childishness?

1090
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:25,001
You are my life.

1091
01:30:26,001 --> 01:30:28,001
Your obstinacy is manliness.

1092
01:30:29,001 --> 01:30:30,501
And my obstinacy is childishness?

1093
01:30:31,085 --> 01:30:32,210
My future belongs to you?

1094
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,210
My past belongs to you?

1095
01:30:33,293 --> 01:30:35,793
Decisions, friendships,
you have a right over everything?

1096
01:30:37,168 --> 01:30:39,085
At least let my life be my own.

1097
01:30:39,876 --> 01:30:42,918
Don't take away my
right to live it or end it.

1098
01:31:24,418 --> 01:31:30,126
I swear on God,
I am so pleased to see you like this.

1099
01:31:32,335 --> 01:31:37,168
Damn you, you look so
charming in your misery.

1100
01:31:37,751 --> 01:31:41,918
People are dogs.
They take pleasure out of sorrow.

1101
01:31:43,376 --> 01:31:45,793
They say that Rocky pees
and shits in his pants now.

1102
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:51,460
He spends his day scraping
the wall with his nails.

1103
01:31:51,751 --> 01:31:53,751
They love to hurt the injured.

1104
01:31:54,835 --> 01:31:58,876
Ibadat and I are getting married.

1105
01:31:59,918 --> 01:32:01,085
This is the first invite.

1106
01:32:04,126 --> 01:32:05,376
Keep it.

1107
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:08,751
At least pick it up.

1108
01:32:10,085 --> 01:32:13,418
Scoundrel, you made such a big enemy.

1109
01:32:13,501 --> 01:32:15,585
You should payback at least a little.

1110
01:32:17,043 --> 01:32:21,210
If no punches then
how about a cuss or two?

1111
01:32:23,126 --> 01:32:27,085
Or Rocky accept that
you are not a man.

1112
01:32:27,335 --> 01:32:28,876
Beg to me.

1113
01:32:30,835 --> 01:32:33,126
May be then you won't
die like your friend did.

1114
01:32:33,376 --> 01:32:35,710
But you'll really have to beg me.

1115
01:32:36,001 --> 01:32:37,418
Is there any attitude left?

1116
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:47,376
If there is any left, then my men
will take care of it in the prison.

1117
01:32:48,668 --> 01:32:51,751
You just don't try
and stifle your screams.

1118
01:32:53,793 --> 01:32:57,085
I heard your friend
at the end shrieked a lot.

1119
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:06,835
Devinder is rather cruel.

1120
01:33:08,085 --> 01:33:11,793
Imagine, he hanged that poor boy.

1121
01:33:20,251 --> 01:33:21,085
But don't worry.

1122
01:33:22,251 --> 01:33:23,251
I give you my word.

1123
01:33:23,501 --> 01:33:27,293
We won't give you the
death your friend got.

1124
01:33:29,251 --> 01:33:33,585
Your punishment will be more severe.

1125
01:33:58,293 --> 01:34:00,668
Hats off to your make?

1126
01:34:02,918 --> 01:34:05,043
What a monkey!

1127
01:34:06,085 --> 01:34:11,168
You know everyone
teases me with your name.

1128
01:34:11,335 --> 01:34:17,501
Oh yes, Shergill's
brother was here yesterday.

1129
01:34:17,876 --> 01:34:20,710
He asked me to take good care of you.

1130
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:27,085
I think he too loves this deadly face.

1131
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:53,376
He killed him!

1132
01:34:54,501 --> 01:34:57,460
He killed my husband like brother!

1133
01:34:59,376 --> 01:35:01,460
This pervert deserved to die!

1134
01:35:02,626 --> 01:35:04,293
Brother,
we are all here in your support.

1135
01:35:07,585 --> 01:35:10,126
Don't move forward.

1136
01:35:10,835 --> 01:35:13,043
We three aren't going
to take any steps.

1137
01:35:14,376 --> 01:35:16,001
Look Mental...

1138
01:35:16,793 --> 01:35:18,626
Mental, stay...

1139
01:35:19,793 --> 01:35:20,501
Mental...

1140
01:35:20,585 --> 01:35:22,335
At least tell me what his name is!

1141
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:53,335
Everyone calls me Mental.

1142
01:35:54,626 --> 01:35:58,085
You should have asked
why I am called so!

1143
01:36:32,626 --> 01:36:35,293
We will now go and talk to him.

1144
01:36:35,418 --> 01:36:37,460
Sir, please tell us...

1145
01:36:40,293 --> 01:36:41,960
We want to know, sir...

1146
01:36:45,001 --> 01:36:47,585
No regret on his face,
no sadness in his eyes.

1147
01:36:48,126 --> 01:36:51,585
His gait was virile and his
eyes challenged section 354.

1148
01:36:52,210 --> 01:36:54,585
as Rocky's
body language suggested..

1149
01:36:54,668 --> 01:36:56,251
..as he just entered the court.

1150
01:36:56,335 --> 01:36:59,918
Rajdeep Singh alias Rocky
ill-famed at the sports hostel..

1151
01:37:00,001 --> 01:37:02,710
..for womanizing and hooliganism..

1152
01:37:02,793 --> 01:37:07,168
..has come to Patiala
court for his hearing today.

1153
01:37:11,043 --> 01:37:12,376
Rajdeep Singh!

1154
01:37:12,751 --> 01:37:14,126
Rajdeep Singh!

1155
01:37:15,085 --> 01:37:18,126
I don't think you understand
the seriousness of this case.

1156
01:37:18,251 --> 01:37:20,918
If you did, all your attention
would have been here.

1157
01:37:21,835 --> 01:37:25,043
Mr. Brar, the national champion
you are fighting for..

1158
01:37:25,376 --> 01:37:29,585
..forget regretting his crime, he doesn't
even have the realization of committing it.

1159
01:37:33,418 --> 01:37:35,418
Once the wedding day is so close..

1160
01:37:36,126 --> 01:37:40,960
..girls from decent families
don't meet their future husbands.

1161
01:37:41,793 --> 01:37:44,168
And you like a fool were
going to meet your lover?

1162
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:27,418
Your beauty is fading.

1163
01:38:29,001 --> 01:38:35,293
I'll make sure you are
bathed in your lover's blood.

1164
01:38:35,793 --> 01:38:38,085
I can't even imagine,
how pretty you would look then.

1165
01:38:38,168 --> 01:38:39,585
Brother, Rocky...

1166
01:38:49,751 --> 01:38:53,585
Brother, your disk must only
come back after kissing a few fairies?

1167
01:38:59,751 --> 01:39:03,085
Oh yea Will you check yourself, Be
careful not to drop your eyeballs in the act.

1168
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:39,210
I'll tell you.

1169
01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:40,293
I'll tell you.

1170
01:39:40,918 --> 01:39:41,626
I'll tell you.

1171
01:39:43,251 --> 01:39:44,001
I'll tell you.

1172
01:39:57,918 --> 01:40:00,251
Don't take it to your heart, darling.

1173
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:05,293
When the time is tough,
you have to endure swords too.

1174
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:10,251
These were mere words.

1175
01:40:18,376 --> 01:40:19,251
Order me.

1176
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,835
Tell me,
what should I do with Shergill?

1177
01:40:25,376 --> 01:40:28,043
Take your revenge, buddy.

1178
01:40:29,085 --> 01:40:29,626
No?

1179
01:40:30,835 --> 01:40:31,876
You have gone soft?

1180
01:40:35,543 --> 01:40:37,918
I spoke to Maninder Shergill.

1181
01:40:38,085 --> 01:40:40,001
I kept your case before him too.

1182
01:40:43,251 --> 01:40:47,793
He told me he had
bad blood with Rocky.

1183
01:40:49,876 --> 01:40:55,126
Tell me Preet Singh,
how do we go about it?

1184
01:40:59,085 --> 01:41:02,626
Maninder Shergill wants
to resolve this once and for all.

1185
01:41:13,710 --> 01:41:17,168
Husk often gets crushed
along with the wheat.

1186
01:42:17,835 --> 01:42:18,876
Let me go...

1187
01:42:19,793 --> 01:42:20,918
Let me go...

1188
01:42:21,168 --> 01:42:22,626
What are you doing?

1189
01:42:28,585 --> 01:42:31,501
Getting you up in the headlines

1190
01:42:41,668 --> 01:42:44,168
Let me go
Our friendship goes back 8 years.

1191
01:42:44,251 --> 01:42:45,751
Can't abandon you like this.

1192
01:42:47,293 --> 01:42:49,626
You don't get fairer overnight.

1193
01:42:50,501 --> 01:42:51,085
Look at him.

1194
01:42:51,585 --> 01:42:55,585
He has an early morning flight to catch
but boy is he enjoying his facewashes .

1195
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:58,460
He schemed his way into
the Commonwealth games.

1196
01:42:58,793 --> 01:43:01,126
That too to Australia.

1197
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,543
Brother, shall I get a scrubber?

1198
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:08,126
You should scrub
all the darkness away.

1199
01:43:08,376 --> 01:43:09,626
Run away, scoundrels.

1200
01:43:10,001 --> 01:43:12,460
Or I will catch the
color of your ugly faces.

1201
01:43:13,376 --> 01:43:14,251
Okay, brother.

1202
01:43:15,085 --> 01:43:16,210
You have a good one yea.

1203
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:17,710
See you in the morning.

1204
01:43:21,126 --> 01:43:21,835
Good night.

1205
01:44:28,559 --> 01:44:30,143
I lost it all, coach.

1206
01:44:31,768 --> 01:44:34,851
What life and what game.

1207
01:44:38,559 --> 01:44:39,851
Now tell me, what do I win over ...

1208
01:44:41,351 --> 01:44:43,184
Preet

1209
01:45:20,601 --> 01:45:23,351
They took everything from me.

1210
01:45:24,601 --> 01:45:26,143
Made me a criminal.

1211
01:45:26,893 --> 01:45:28,059
No, son.

1212
01:45:30,518 --> 01:45:32,018
Don't lose hope.

1213
01:45:33,309 --> 01:45:37,268
You will surrender to
the police in the morning.

1214
01:45:38,768 --> 01:45:40,059
You shouldn't have run away.

1215
01:45:42,559 --> 01:45:45,434
We will stay within the
boundaries of law and fight.

1216
01:45:48,893 --> 01:45:51,393
I gave up fighting in the ring itself.

1217
01:45:53,393 --> 01:45:55,809
Players win and lose.

1218
01:45:56,851 --> 01:46:01,143
Criminals... kill and die.

1219
01:46:02,309 --> 01:46:04,226
The law can't catch me dead

1220
01:46:05,559 --> 01:46:07,518
And I am not destined to die.

1221
01:46:49,184 --> 01:46:51,351
He is my nephew, Rajdeep.

1222
01:46:52,518 --> 01:46:54,268
He stays with me with his mother.

1223
01:46:55,309 --> 01:46:57,476
His mother has gone
through a tough time.

1224
01:46:58,601 --> 01:47:00,143
Alcohol killed her husband.

1225
01:47:00,226 --> 01:47:01,518
And hooliganism killed her eldest son.

1226
01:47:02,101 --> 01:47:04,309
She now spends her days praying.

1227
01:47:04,434 --> 01:47:07,559
Rajdeep doesn't listen to her.
And he doesn't heed my advice either.

1228
01:47:07,893 --> 01:47:12,726
He fights at home,
at school and in the village.

1229
01:47:12,976 --> 01:47:14,643
If he isn't guided to the right path..

1230
01:47:16,226 --> 01:47:20,601
..he'd ruin his own life and
his mother's like his brother did.

1231
01:47:22,226 --> 01:47:23,476
Help me.

1232
01:47:31,601 --> 01:47:33,309
In which grade are you, Rajdeep?

1233
01:47:33,434 --> 01:47:34,268
Sixth.

1234
01:47:36,726 --> 01:47:37,851
Do you like going to school?

1235
01:47:39,309 --> 01:47:40,893
Do you teach wrestling?

1236
01:47:43,226 --> 01:47:44,601
You like wrestling?

1237
01:47:44,684 --> 01:47:46,268
Mother doesn't let
me watch it at home.

1238
01:47:46,351 --> 01:47:47,559
I watch it at Binder's place.

1239
01:47:48,393 --> 01:47:50,351
No one is here to fight as yet?

1240
01:47:53,809 --> 01:47:54,976
This is boxing, son.

1241
01:47:56,184 --> 01:47:57,309
It isn't fought. It is played.

1242
01:47:57,518 --> 01:47:59,268
You get hurt?

1243
01:47:59,726 --> 01:48:02,351
Yes, sometimes. A little.

1244
01:48:02,643 --> 01:48:04,059
Even your players?

1245
01:48:05,101 --> 01:48:07,434
What punishment do you
give to those who get hurt?

1246
01:48:07,684 --> 01:48:08,601
I don't punish.

1247
01:48:10,309 --> 01:48:11,226
I teach them how to play.

1248
01:48:11,393 --> 01:48:14,768
My brother used to beat
me up when I used to get hurt.

1249
01:48:15,809 --> 01:48:20,768
My brother was shot to death with 8
bullets by two boys from Balian village.

1250
01:48:22,226 --> 01:48:25,684
Will I be able to kill
them if I learn to box?

1251
01:48:31,351 --> 01:48:31,976
What happened?

1252
01:48:32,809 --> 01:48:33,934
Answer it already!

1253
01:48:35,018 --> 01:48:35,601
What does he say?

1254
01:48:36,059 --> 01:48:38,018
The taxi driver is
getting on my nerves.

1255
01:48:38,184 --> 01:48:39,643
Take it in writing. - What?

1256
01:48:39,726 --> 01:48:41,101
He must be applying creams. - Yes.

1257
01:48:41,184 --> 01:48:42,809
Let's go upstairs and get him.
- Let's go.

1258
01:48:43,101 --> 01:48:44,309
Let's go. I'll...

1259
01:48:49,018 --> 01:48:51,351
Brother!

1260
01:48:51,934 --> 01:48:53,934
Brother!

1261
01:49:06,476 --> 01:49:07,018
Hello?

1262
01:49:09,309 --> 01:49:10,643
He is praying.

1263
01:49:25,476 --> 01:49:30,226
They have found two
boys dead in the campus.

1264
01:49:48,809 --> 01:49:51,851
These images are from ANSI campus..

1265
01:49:51,934 --> 01:49:54,559
..where two players
have been found hanging dead

1266
01:49:54,934 --> 01:49:58,684
You must have never seen
Such brutal deaths before.

1267
01:49:59,351 --> 01:50:03,101
Baljeet Singh, who was scheduled to go to
Australia for the Commonwealth games..

1268
01:50:03,684 --> 01:50:06,309
..was found hanging
from a height of 30 feet.

1269
01:50:06,476 --> 01:50:09,893
Whereas Devinder,
a state discus champion..

1270
01:50:09,976 --> 01:50:12,893
..was hung from the top
of a 250 feet tall stadium.

1271
01:50:12,976 --> 01:50:16,143
Police say that Rocky who ran
from police custody yesterday..

1272
01:50:16,226 --> 01:50:19,226
..is responsible for their murders.

1273
01:50:19,518 --> 01:50:22,143
the Patiala SSP has
assured everyone that..

1274
01:50:22,226 --> 01:50:24,934
..the culprit will
be arrested by today evening.

1275
01:50:35,018 --> 01:50:38,226
Maninder has all the
men looking for Rocky.

1276
01:50:38,309 --> 01:50:41,143
Where is Maninder? - He's Out.

1277
01:50:46,101 --> 01:50:47,018
Maninder?

1278
01:50:47,101 --> 01:50:48,476
You are getting married tomorrow.

1279
01:50:48,809 --> 01:50:52,351
Your friends and family
are waiting for you.

1280
01:50:52,559 --> 01:50:55,893
Brother, tell them to wait.

1281
01:50:56,434 --> 01:51:01,143
Maninder is going to kill his
enemy today and dance all night.

1282
01:52:07,143 --> 01:52:10,309
Rocky, why aren't you saying anything?

1283
01:52:10,976 --> 01:52:13,476
I'm talking my heart out.

1284
01:52:14,768 --> 01:52:16,434
But today, you can't hear it.

1285
01:52:17,143 --> 01:52:18,643
You are under my oath.

1286
01:52:18,726 --> 01:52:19,809
Take me away from here.

1287
01:52:20,143 --> 01:52:21,601
I will die.

1288
01:52:21,684 --> 01:52:23,434
I don't want to marry Maninder.

1289
01:52:25,351 --> 01:52:27,976
Your earlier accusation
destroyed my life

1290
01:52:29,434 --> 01:52:31,018
I can't bear responsibility
for your murder

1291
01:52:31,101 --> 01:52:33,184
Rocky, I am so sorry.

1292
01:52:33,268 --> 01:52:35,351
Your entire college
called me by a name.

1293
01:52:35,393 --> 01:52:37,059
You know why they
called me that right!

1294
01:53:09,059 --> 01:53:13,059
Remove your last names
from behind your cars.

1295
01:53:15,893 --> 01:53:19,726
Four men together beat up one person?

1296
01:53:21,726 --> 01:53:23,268
Here is a true Jatt!

1297
01:53:25,518 --> 01:53:28,309
And this is his fight for revenge.

1298
01:53:29,309 --> 01:53:32,101
Judgments by courts cant stop him.

1299
01:53:32,976 --> 01:53:38,393
He will only accept a death warrant
issued by his enemy.

1300
01:53:45,351 --> 01:53:49,101
Scoundrels,
did you pull out his tongue?

1301
01:53:49,768 --> 01:53:52,226
He's not even whimpering.

1302
01:53:58,851 --> 01:54:01,643
You dribble like a dog for sure.

1303
01:54:02,893 --> 01:54:05,393
But you still bite like a puppy.

1304
01:54:18,893 --> 01:54:20,643
What a Jatt.

1305
01:54:21,893 --> 01:54:24,684
Cornered in a trap
yet he holds his head high.

1306
01:54:25,184 --> 01:54:28,934
Bow your head and
show some shame at least.

1307
01:54:29,351 --> 01:54:32,809
And it'll be easier to cut it off.

1308
01:54:33,901 --> 01:54:39,331
Who gets cornered in a trap and who
lays the trap is just a matter of perspective.

1309
01:54:39,351 --> 01:54:46,684
You came sniffing for me with
your head bowed to die at my hands.

1310
01:56:59,851 --> 01:57:03,976
I couldn't burn my brother's pyre

1311
01:57:05,101 --> 01:57:10,351
But here
I burnt your's.

1312
01:57:37,458 --> 01:57:38,916
Kill them all.

1313
01:57:40,458 --> 01:57:43,750
Wait, Bring the girl to me.

1314
01:58:44,208 --> 01:58:45,583
Give me another one.

1315
01:59:57,916 --> 02:00:00,125
She's been waiting
for you to cajole her.

1316
02:00:01,583 --> 02:00:05,291
She isn't getting salve
for her open wounds.

1317
02:00:05,375 --> 02:00:06,708
Rocky!

1318
02:00:08,208 --> 02:00:12,208
My younger brother used
to be just as stubborn.

1319
02:00:14,416 --> 02:00:15,583
Rocky!

1320
02:00:21,333 --> 02:00:25,750
My brother's screams
echo in the darkness.

1321
02:00:27,416 --> 02:00:31,458
I am a Jatt just like you.

1322
02:00:32,083 --> 02:00:34,833
I'll color tomorrow's
dawn with her blood.

1323
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:38,208
Save her if you can.

1324
02:00:39,291 --> 02:00:43,333
My men are eager
to take a bite off her.

1325
02:01:03,583 --> 02:01:05,541
See that now.

1326
02:01:25,416 --> 02:01:33,400
Like sweat I wiped
off all my enemies today

1327
02:01:33,583 --> 02:01:39,291
Like sweat I wiped off
all my enemies today - CATCH HIM

1328
02:01:44,541 --> 02:01:49,833
These honorable warriors
are born from the grain of the earth

1329
02:01:49,916 --> 02:01:55,333
There is only 1 in a 100 who will
fight unto death for his principles

1330
02:01:55,375 --> 02:02:00,666
Those who move mountains verbally are
inept of changing the course of winds

1331
02:02:00,750 --> 02:02:08,716
But I am going to do the impossible
such is my belief in myself

1332
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:16,841
Like sweat I wiped
off all my enemies today

1333
02:02:17,125 --> 02:02:21,250
Like sweat I wiped
off all my enemies today

1334
02:02:21,875 --> 02:02:23,166
Rocky!

1335
02:02:24,541 --> 02:02:26,458
He shouldn't get away now.

1336
02:02:35,541 --> 02:02:38,875
Rocky are you alright?

1337
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:43,375
I knew you'd come Rocky

1338
02:02:52,166 --> 02:02:54,083
"Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

1339
02:02:55,083 --> 02:03:00,583
This is the end for you.
Enough of this!

1340
02:03:07,541 --> 02:03:12,791
A true man will never lose

1341
02:03:12,875 --> 02:03:18,291
Jackal's will run from the
battlefield at the roars of lions

1342
02:03:18,333 --> 02:03:21,083
Lions are lions not
because of their coat

1343
02:03:21,166 --> 02:03:23,875
But their hearts

1344
02:03:23,958 --> 02:03:26,541
Friends this is the concrete truth

1345
02:03:26,625 --> 02:03:29,916
The first and the last statement

1346
02:04:05,083 --> 02:04:07,541
'Rocky, brother...'

1347
02:04:08,625 --> 02:04:10,958
'This is India's star's life.'

1348
02:04:12,708 --> 02:04:13,666
'It won't give up that easily.'

1349
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:16,958
'Not today Preet, not anymore.'

1350
02:04:52,083 --> 02:04:55,375
Did Rocky ever contact
you after that night?

1351
02:04:56,458 --> 02:04:58,916
Any information about
him from anywhere?

1352
02:04:59,250 --> 02:05:01,875
No one knows anything about him.

1353
02:05:03,083 --> 02:05:05,875
Last night police killed
a guy in an encounter.

1354
02:05:06,958 --> 02:05:09,458
Police won't identify his body.

1355
02:05:21,583 --> 02:05:24,125
Police can't catch Rocky dead.

1356
02:05:24,208 --> 02:05:26,333
'And I am not destined to die.'

1357
02:05:26,583 --> 02:05:28,500
And he isn't destined to die.

1358
02:05:55,458 --> 02:05:58,625
Watch out here I come x4

1359
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:02,041
Watch out here I come x4

1360
02:06:02,375 --> 02:06:08,791
Watch out here I come x4

1361
02:06:36,708 --> 02:06:38,833
SO did you feel the heat champions?

1362
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:45,916
"Desi crew!"

1363
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,166
"Desi crew!"

1364
02:06:47,250 --> 02:06:48,750
"Desi crew!"

1365
02:06:48,833 --> 02:06:49,500
"Desi crew!"

1366
02:06:49,625 --> 02:06:52,250
"My buddies are my lifeline..."

1367
02:06:52,333 --> 02:06:55,333
"Look down when you talk to me, foe."

1368
02:06:55,375 --> 02:06:58,125
"My buddies are my lifeline..."

1369
02:06:58,208 --> 02:07:00,333
"Show some respect when
you talk to me, oh dear."

1370
02:07:00,375 --> 02:07:03,166
"My buddies are my lifeline..."

1371
02:07:03,250 --> 02:07:06,000
"Show some respect when
you talk to me, oh dear."

1372
02:07:06,083 --> 02:07:08,666
"Patience is something, I agree."

1373
02:07:08,750 --> 02:07:11,750
"It doesn't last forever,
so you should worry."

1374
02:07:11,833 --> 02:07:14,416
"I don't worry about court,
officials or even hell..."

1375
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:15,458
"I have my buddies..."

1376
02:07:15,583 --> 02:07:18,500
"I have my buddies watching
my back like a loaded gun."

1377
02:07:18,625 --> 02:07:19,916
"I have my buddies..."

1378
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,875
"I have my buddies watching
my back like a loaded gun."

1379
02:07:22,958 --> 02:07:25,041
"I have my buddies..."

1380
02:07:25,125 --> 02:07:27,333
"I have my buddies..."

1381
02:07:38,583 --> 02:07:41,500
"I struck gold when I met you."

1382
02:07:41,625 --> 02:07:44,416
"Now I walk with pride.
Nothing can stop me."

1383
02:07:44,500 --> 02:07:47,208
"I won't let any harm come to you."

1384
02:07:47,291 --> 02:07:49,916
"Your Dhillon seeks support from God."

1385
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,583
"I won't let any harm come to you."

1386
02:07:52,666 --> 02:07:55,208
"Your Dhillon gets support from God."

1387
02:07:55,291 --> 02:07:57,291
"It's God's grace..."

1388
02:07:58,166 --> 02:08:00,458
"It's God's grace, their company."

1389
02:08:00,583 --> 02:08:01,875
"I have my buddies..."

1390
02:08:01,958 --> 02:08:04,416
"I have my buddies watching
my back like a loaded gun."

1391
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:06,166
"I have my buddies..."

1392
02:08:06,333 --> 02:08:08,833
"I have my buddies watching
my back like a loaded gun."

1393
02:08:08,916 --> 02:08:11,000
"I have my buddies..."

1394
02:08:11,583 --> 02:08:13,500
"I have my buddies..."

1395
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:17,041
"I have my buddies watching
my back like a loaded gun."

1396
02:08:17,125 --> 02:08:18,583
"I have my buddies..."

1397
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,375
"I have my buddies watching
my back like a loaded gun."

1398
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:24,208
"I have my buddies..."

1399
02:08:25,083 --> 02:08:27,625
"I tell the truth.
I don't like to fib."

1400
02:08:27,708 --> 02:08:30,291
"May our friendship
stay strong forever."

1401
02:08:30,333 --> 02:08:33,166
"With God's grace, we have fun."

1402
02:08:33,250 --> 02:08:35,791
"We handle whatever comes out way."

1403
02:08:35,875 --> 02:08:38,625
"With God's grace, we have fun."

1404
02:08:38,708 --> 02:08:41,375
"We handle whatever comes out way."

1405
02:08:41,458 --> 02:08:44,041
