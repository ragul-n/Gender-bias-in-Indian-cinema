2
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,583
That's enough, Headman.

3
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:10,583
There's no need of so much water.

4
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,833
But we need a lot of water, SDO Sir.

5
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:19,458
Look, you are already getting
75% of the water supply.

6
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:22,167
Let the poor farmers
also reap a few grains.

7
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,208
They are only left with
25% of the water supply.

8
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,500
We will increase your percentage.

9
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,333
You can then decrease theirs.

10
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,458
Officer, we own more land.

11
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,542
They hardly have 2.5 acres each.

12
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:37,583
But you have comparatively lesser
land near the Canal outlet.

13
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:43,042
Inspector, I don't think that he is
interested in helping us.

14
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:46,250
Now only you will have
to resolve our issue.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,375
Come on headman, This isn't an Algebra
question which needs to be solved.

16
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,250
I have one way to solve it.

17
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:01,042
If you need Canal outlet's water..

18
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,083
..then you'll have to find
a solution to Canal outlet land.

19
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:10,042
Why are you joking, inspector.

20
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,500
Do you know who does the
Canal outlet land belong to?

21
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,000
Jaggi Khuwala.

22
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,042
Jaggi Khuwala.

23
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:31,833
I, Bimla Kumari, welcome you to
the programme " My village, My fields ".

24
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,875
Today we are going to introduce
you to a successful farmer..

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,875
..from district Ludhiana's village
Bullewal Khurd, Jagjeet Singh.

26
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,208
Who is an expert in organic farming.

27
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:43,042
Hello, Mr. Jagjeet Singh.

28
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:46,042
Yes.

29
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,958
Hello to everyone.

30
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,917
Madam, this is my first
time in front of the camera.

31
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:51,500
So, I am a little shy.

32
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:54,458
So ask me the questions quickly.
I will answer them in brief.

33
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,167
- Okay, Mr. Jagjeet Singh.
- Okay, Madam.

34
00:02:56,292 --> 00:03:00,250
Tell us, what is the reason behind
such a big size of this pumpkin?

35
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,375
Forget about the pumpkin.
Ask me about this radish.

36
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,625
Okay, Mr. Jagjeet Singh.

37
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,208
You Tell us about this radish's
extraordinary growth.

38
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:09,625
You haven't asked me about
the name of my radish.

39
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:11,542
Her name is Ms. Radish.

40
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:12,875
- Okay, Mr. Jagjeet Singh.
- Yes, Madam.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,250
Tell us, how can one
grow this type of Ms. Radish.

42
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,542
Don't ask how, ask why.

43
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:19,963
- Ask that.
- Okay.

44
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,792
You leave it.
I will tell you why.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,750
All farmers had been growing
small small radishes.

46
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,458
- If one has to do agriculture, then it should be something advanced.
- Okay.

47
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,375
Like we nurture our children
with food and love..

48
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,292
- ..and then they grow up to be young and healthy..
- Right.

49
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:34,667
Similarly You need to nurture them
also with love and good manure.

50
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,292
And then only,
they reach to this blooming youth.

51
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,833
- Okay.
- Yes, Madam.

52
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:39,917
That was Mr. Jagjeet Singh..

53
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:41,042
No no no, no. We are still to discuss
about the pumpkin.

54
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,458
The one about which
you questioned me earlier.

55
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,708
- No, some other time, maybe.
- Yes, I grow peanuts as well.

56
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:50,250
This was Mr. Jagjeet Singh. Who
told us about his farming inventions.

57
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:51,208
Goodbye.

58
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,292
Goodbye.

59
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:55,500
- Live Long!
- Successful farmer!

60
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,667
- My village..
- My fields.

61
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,708
" White teeth.."

62
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:21,833
" White teeth can't stop smiling."

63
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,042
So, makes sense?

64
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:26,875
Really?

65
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:30,958
No?

66
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,333
Then here it is, a peppy number.

67
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:48,083
" Enjoy the frivolous fun of the fair."

68
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:53,625
" Enjoy the frivolous fun of the fair."

69
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:58,458
Roop, people think we tend to feel
like dancing when they hear music.

70
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,667
These naive ones don't know
that milk also comes like this only.

71
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,458
Roop Kaur..

72
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,333
..don't you think you are getting
more demanding like the movie stars?

73
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:09,583
Taking into consideration
the current situation of Punjab..

74
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,500
You will give milk only on Wednesdays.

75
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,958
When we have power..

76
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,167
I will play the songs.

77
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,542
And then, Roop will produce milk.

78
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,042
Don't question me.

79
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,000
You are from Khurd?

80
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,708
Start the engine, and go back.

81
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,667
Leave.

82
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:43,375
This is a government market.

83
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:47,250
You cannot stop me from
selling my vegetables here.

84
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,750
What do you think of yourself?

85
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,583
Here's Gorkhaland, center point.

86
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,250
Attack.

87
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:25,625
Hands up!

88
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,792
Why did you throw
uncle's cauliflowers?

89
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,005
What's this?

90
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,708
He's their headman's son.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,125
He wanted to enroll in the army,
they thought he left his legs home.

92
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:49,125
Did the headman father him
or manufacture him?

93
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:53,167
Stand here,
I'll go and call your father.

94
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:55,000
Why don't you stand up first?

95
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,583
Go and call whomever you want.

96
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,167
Oh no.

97
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,083
You shouldn't be hesitant.

98
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,750
You should holler.

99
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,083
You were about to get drowned.

100
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,917
You have your farmer
brother here to help you.

101
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:12,208
Now you will have to take a sunbath.

102
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,042
What about you?

103
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,750
Are you getting enough protein?

104
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,542
Here you go.

105
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,417
Kidding, eh?!

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,958
Who performed this black magic?

107
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,125
Oh yes, I have done
this for the growth process.

108
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:31,417
You have only grown
so much in two weeks?

109
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,375
Don't you want to grow
up to be like a pumpkin?

110
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,542
Should I ask aunt to
add you in stuffed flatbread?

111
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:38,542
Scared you!

112
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,375
You go here.

113
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,292
- And ambushing me from behind..
- Let's go.

114
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:52,500
" In my mind she dwells
as a beautiful dream.."

115
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,125
No matter what happens.
I am not going anywhere today.

116
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,667
You couldn't become a soldier..

117
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:11,583
..so you are turning our
village into a battlefield.

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,292
Come with us, quickly.

119
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:15,792
You cannot become a successful
farmer if you keep fighting.

120
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,958
Those guys from Kalan
beat us black and blue.

121
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:18,922
They insulted us as well.

122
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:21,750
This is Jaggi's well and
not Jalaluddin Akbar's court..

123
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:23,500
..where problems of
the troubled are resolved.

124
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,250
Take the Headman with you and
file a report at the police station.

125
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,917
If you keep doing this then you won't
be able to concentrate on farming.

126
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,875
They ruined uncle
Jagat's cauliflowers.

127
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,042
They say they won't let
our vegetables sell in the market.

128
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:34,292
So what should I do?

129
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,792
In the end all the villagers
say the same thing.

130
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,333
" Jaggi is naive. Jaggi is mad."

131
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,250
" You cannot be mad at a mad man."

132
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,292
The village council
isn't as good as you..

133
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:46,000
..when it comes to resolving issues.

134
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,417
Jaggi, they will become
fearless if we don't counter.

135
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,000
- Right.
- Soon they will go after my corn.

136
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,500
And then they will
uproot your radishes.

137
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:56,375
How will we get the
money to harvest the wheat?

138
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,667
Our farmers will commit suicide.

139
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:00,083
We won't even be able
to sow Pearl Millet.

140
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,750
Our cattle will starve to death.

141
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:02,922
Think about it.

142
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,458
What will happen
to your Roop and Preet?

143
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,333
What if we end up fighting?

144
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,375
It's okay if it stays in the village.

145
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,083
But if it reaches
Jalandhar Doordarshan..

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,375
..then my career will fail
like a weak roof does when it rains.

147
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:28,583
I cannot go with you guys.

148
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:29,667
Fine, then.

149
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:32,125
You can save either
your career or your village.

150
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,417
Let's go then.

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,917
Get the tractor ready.
I will go and talk to them.

152
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:12,125
Uncle, if you move the tractor
then you will never move again.

153
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,708
Think about it.

154
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,167
Nimma, let's resolve this right away.

155
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:23,875
Why exaggerate the matter?

156
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,375
Apologize to him and
resolve this here itself.

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,417
Okay, let's resolve it.

158
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:38,208
Draw five lines with your nose.

159
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,750
That's enough to resolve it.

160
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,208
Tell me, how can I help you?

161
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,042
I am talking to him.

162
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,208
This isn't a solution, Nimma.

163
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Soldier, you were
talking about this Jaggi?

164
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,208
You have already beaten them up.

165
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,875
Bimla madam says that too
much fertilizer kills the weeds..

166
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:21,875
..but it also kills
the crop sometimes.

167
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:22,875
Get lost.

168
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,963
Don't push me, brother.

169
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,375
Otherwise, he will show up.

170
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,708
Who will show up?

171
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,083
The successful farmer gives up.

172
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,250
Now this game will last for long.

173
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,000
Manage the situation in the end.

174
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:48,792
The bitch should chew on
the bone which she can swallow.

175
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,583
You shouldn't feel hesitant.

176
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,708
You should call me
whenever you need me.

177
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,667
I am not hesitant, Brother.

178
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:30,583
I am scared of you.

179
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,000
I thought you were only a coward.

180
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,250
You are also mental, Sardaar (SIKH).

181
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,167
We tried telling them before as well.

182
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,292
But they never understand.

183
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,875
"Ji".(TITLE OF RESPECT)

184
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:19,792
Sardaarji.

185
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:26,333
Whenever you say Sardaar,
always include " Ji " with it.

186
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,292
" Sardaarji!"

187
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:42,667
" Sardaarji!"

188
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,083
" He looks smashing in a long top,
sheet and a stick."

189
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,005
" Especially when the
stick held on the shoulders."

190
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,750
" The chicks dressed in
colorful attire fall for it.."

191
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:53,208
" He walks with pride."

192
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,542
" He looks smashing in a long top,
sheet and a stick."

193
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,417
" Especially when the
stick held on the shoulders."

194
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,917
" The chicks dressed in colorful attire
fall for it.."

195
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:02,458
" He walks with pride."

196
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:06,583
" The ones with pride don't
talk about a female with a smile."

197
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,958
" About a female."

198
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,667
" He wishes to rock the
dance floor with her.."

199
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:18,417
" Says so Sardaarji!"

200
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,963
" He wishes to rock
the dance floor with her.."

201
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,750
" Says so Sardaarji!"

202
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,250
" He wishes to rock
the dance floor with her.."

203
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,625
" Says so Sardaarji!"

204
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,750
" You should give
your heart to only one."

205
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,667
" You should don't cheat your beloved."

206
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,250
" Promise me that you
will meet me for sure."

207
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,042
" I don't want the telephonic love."

208
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:57,958
" To wait for someone is not
a habit of your beloved Ranbir.."

209
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:02,375
" Of your beloved Ranbir.."

210
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:07,922
" He wishes to rock
the dance floor with her.."

211
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:09,917
" Says so Sardaarji!"

212
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,167
" He wishes to rock
the dance floor with her.."

213
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,792
" Says so Sardaarji!"

214
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,083
" Toys for the girls."

215
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,083
" Turban for my brother."

216
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,125
" Stole for my sister-in-law."

217
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,667
" And Zilch for the son-in-law."

218
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,750
This song help you
get rid of your anger?

219
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,542
Yes, Doctor.
This helps me get rid of Athra.

220
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,417
Athra?

221
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,250
Yes, I call him Athra.

222
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,458
From when can you see Athra?

223
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,542
I think I was five when
I saw him for the first time.

224
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,833
He used to be around this tall.

225
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,125
He had a small amount
of hair gathered over his head.

226
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,000
" Toys for the girls.
Turban for my brother."

227
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,833
" Stole for my sister-in-law.
And Zilch for the son-in-law."

228
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,458
" Toys for the girls.
Turban for my brother."

229
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,208
He was so cute to look at.

230
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,333
But that idiot is very hot tempered.

231
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:33,625
Do you feel scared
when Athra shows up?

232
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,333
He isn't a ghost that
I would be scared of him.

233
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:37,208
Tell me about it!

234
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,958
Do you shiver when he shows up?

235
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,000
Do you think that I get fits?

236
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,208
I am not unwell.

237
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,417
He shows up when I am very angry.

238
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,667
He also shows up with
stupid advices sometimes.

239
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,625
But I don't give in so easily.

240
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,750
When brought you to Australia?

241
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:56,792
I will have to go.

242
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,125
You don't understand.

243
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:04,208
By go I mean..
You know my uncle in Australia?

244
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,833
He has sent sponsorship for me.

245
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:12,417
Now I will go to Australia!

246
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:16,125
Hold on. Get your airplane down.
You are always so hasty.

247
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:20,458
Babbu, you are really going to leave?

248
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:23,708
Yeah. I am gone.

249
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,917
So now Babbu too will come visit
us every year and get shampoo for us.

250
00:17:58,917 --> 00:17:59,833
Damn you!

251
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,667
" Toys for the girls.
Turban for my brother."

252
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,750
" Stole for my sister-in-law.
And Zilch for the son-in-law."

253
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:13,292
No matter what happens today.
Don't let go of me, okay?

254
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:15,250
" Stole for my sister-in-law.
And Zilch for the son-in-law."

255
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,000
" Toys for the girls.
Turban for my brother."

256
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,375
Half the village is on bed.

257
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:25,042
SHO, don't you follow
law and order here?

258
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:27,833
Our sons barely escaped death.

259
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,792
File big charges, Inspector.

260
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,083
Charges will be filed.

261
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,792
That too today itself.

262
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,417
And the charges will be big as well.

263
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:41,292
He will be charged under section 307,
323, 324 and 326.

264
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,333
Influence quota,
when you charge someone with 307..

265
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,833
..then that person
is also charged with 506.

266
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,458
Yes.
Have patience.

267
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,667
Why are you being hasty?

268
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:53,792
I will charge with more
sections than you are aware of.

269
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,583
" Jaggi is naive."

270
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,458
" Jaggi is mad."

271
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:04,458
" You cannot be mad at a mad man."

272
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:07,625
Uncle, I am not talking about Jaggi.

273
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:13,958
Charges will be made against Dara,
Bhola and Babbu.

274
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,333
- Surjit!
- Yes, sir!

275
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:16,375
Take them inside!

276
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,542
Let's go.

277
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,667
People from both the villages know..

278
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:20,833
..that I am the only one who hit them.

279
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,292
You can file the charges on me.

280
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:24,208
Uncle..

281
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:29,917
You say Jaggi is naive.
Jaggi is mad.

282
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,042
But he seems to be
a very responsible person.

283
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:36,583
Look, he is ready to get himself
arrested for his friends' sake.

284
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:39,833
Well, who hit you?

285
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:44,375
They are lying.

286
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,000
Do you have any eyewitness?

287
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,167
Yes, we do.

288
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:49,000
We witnessed it.

289
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:51,880
Do you think the police is lying?

290
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,833
I understand what you
are trying to do, Inspector.

291
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,708
Now tell me, what will it take for
the police to change its testimony?

292
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:58,000
Listen up.

293
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,542
People from Bullewal
Kalan have decided..

294
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:05,458
..that if you let them have the Canal
outlet land then they can compromise.

295
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:07,542
The Canal outlet land?

296
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:08,625
How is that possible?

297
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,250
We have already given you
more than half of that land.

298
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,500
If we let go of the rest
of it then what will we do?

299
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:14,750
Play drums?

300
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:17,917
Fine then, do one thing.

301
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,500
Pay them the price of the land.

302
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,750
1.5 crore.

303
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:21,792
1.5 crore.

304
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:22,792
It's nothing.

305
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,917
1.5 crore?

306
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,333
It's nothing.
1.5 crore is hardly a sum.

307
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:30,792
We will have to sell half of
the village land to gather 1.5 crores.

308
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,917
Say something reasonable, Inspector.

309
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,375
From where will we
get 1.5 crore so quickly?

310
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,250
No, no, no.

311
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,167
We are not here to cheat you.

312
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,375
We give you six months.

313
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:49,042
This is injustice.

314
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,458
I will take this matter to the MLA.

315
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:57,500
Successful farmer,
now spit around the whole village.

316
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:01,625
Now we will know whether
you can only fight..

317
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,917
Or you also know how
to stand tall after the fight.

318
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:07,375
As police always makes false reports..

319
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:13,792
The fact is, the one who hurts
is the one who shall compensate.

320
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:22,000
If you are man enough
then come with the documents..

321
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,917
..of the land near
Canal outlet before 10:00am.

322
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:29,000
Otherwise, I will press
charges on all three of them.

323
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,125
" Toys for the girls.
Turban for my brother."

324
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,917
" Stole for my sister-in-law.
And Zilch for the son-in-law."

325
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:56,958
Brother Jaggi,
I have brought dinner for you.

326
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,875
Eat it quickly.

327
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,792
It contains Rs. 480.

328
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,417
I wanted to buy a new school uniform.

329
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,125
The old one will last
for another six months or so.

330
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,042
Buy the new uniform.

331
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,958
My father says that only
fortunate ones get a son like Jaggi.

332
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:26,083
My father keeps scolding me.

333
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,458
I too will grow up
to be a successful farmer.

334
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,917
Just like you.

335
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:34,125
Oh no, I forgot to
get rice pudding for you.

336
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,708
I'll go get it right away.

337
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:10,333
Dhurru's father..

338
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:12,542
Mithu's uncle..

339
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,917
Uncle Satta..

340
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:17,708
Why anyone who hangs
from the tree becomes a star?

341
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:21,417
Father, I will throw
all the ropes into the well.

342
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:33,208
Dara Singh,
Kuldeep Singh a.k.a. Bhola..

343
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,500
..and Balwinder Singh a.k.a. Babbu..

344
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:40,292
..don't leave this village
for the next six months.

345
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:43,542
Or else I will break your legs.

346
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,250
Have you signed on the dotted line?

347
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:06,542
Just like his father.

348
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:10,708
He didn't make the right
decision when in trouble.

349
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,167
And neither did he.

350
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,500
One mistake.

351
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:25,792
I still carry the burden of one
wrong decision of his, in my memories.

352
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:28,042
I too am carrying that burden.

353
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:31,125
This is right time
to unburden ourselves.

354
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,958
Decisions are not
always taken from heart.

355
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,833
Some decisions are made
using your mind as well.

356
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,083
Ask him.

357
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:42,458
Ask him,
who will get 1.5 crore rupees?

358
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,458
Babbu, call your uncle in Australia.

359
00:26:57,792 --> 00:26:59,500
Tell him that Jaggi
is coming to Australia.

360
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:09,000
You will have to leave your village,
field and the well.

361
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:14,042
If I can help my family
by going away from them..

362
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,000
..then it is not a bad deal.

363
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,917
I am not very smart, Uncle.

364
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,708
But I know..

365
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,792
..that all decisions
should be taken from heart.

366
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,750
When you use your mind,
what you are doing is business.

367
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:29,625
You have been choused.

368
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:32,375
Yes.

369
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:34,833
One thing is for certain..

370
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:38,625
A Jatt has to suffer
a lot in his life.

371
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:41,250
Nothing to say?

372
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:47,917
I got you.

373
00:28:56,625 --> 00:29:00,000
Jaggi, if you want
to make 1.5 crores..

374
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:02,250
Then you will have to work hard.

375
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,750
I was no line man in the
electricity department..

376
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:06,583
..in my village that
I'd fear hard work.

377
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,250
Uncle, you should go see my fields.

378
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:09,667
I work very hard.

379
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,500
I caught the thief.

380
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:16,792
- Cheating.. cheating.
- Where will you go now?

381
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:18,208
I caught the thief.

382
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:21,667
Mr. Jaggi, did you seek
permission lift me up?

383
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,458
Sorry.

384
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:27,500
Sorry madam.

385
00:29:27,792 --> 00:29:29,583
Welcome to Australia.

386
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:31,708
Now you can.

387
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:35,542
You can lift her.

388
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,083
- Let's go.
- Come let's go.

389
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:41,833
Wonderful.

390
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:44,292
Let's consume from
flatbreads of Australia.

391
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:46,208
- Eat.
- Hello, Shini.

392
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:50,208
Excuse me, it's Shiny.

393
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,000
She is so smart.

394
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,542
She is so naughty.

395
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,583
She has troubled me
with her colorful orbs.

396
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:59,667
- Orbs?
- A ball. A plaything?

397
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:01,875
Orb. A common noun.

398
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:03,833
Punjabi heritage, you know.

399
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,542
Jaggi, they know nothing about it.

400
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,000
All they know is English.

401
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,125
That's good as well.

402
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:11,583
You know Punjabi. She knows English.

403
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:12,875
It is a great amalgam.

404
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:15,167
Now what's this amalgam?

405
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:18,042
Now explain to her
what does amalgam mean.

406
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,125
Combination, dear.

407
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,917
Like the combination of
uncle's moustache with his hat.

408
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:23,750
Like the combination of your mother's
Indian dress with sports shoes.

409
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:25,500
And coke with flatbreads.

410
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,292
I say it is amazing.

411
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,500
Don't feel shy, Ms. Shiny.

412
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,833
Here you go. Chug it.

413
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:33,708
Of course, it is, Mr. Jaggi.

414
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,542
But don't you think you
are getting late for your job..

415
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,000
..by chitchatting with me?

416
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,417
It's your first day of the job, dude.

417
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:42,833
It's difficult.

418
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,958
You have only six months to earn Rs.
1.5 crores.

419
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:50,792
Not difficult, Doctor. Very difficult.

420
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:55,708
It has already been five months.

421
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:57,292
What?

422
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:59,042
What did you do in these five months?

423
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:15,042
" This cruel one won't stop.."

424
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:17,667
Hey, what are you doing?

425
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,417
How is it?

426
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:20,458
Take it down.

427
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,917
They shamelessly show up.
Bloody shameless rustics.

428
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,500
I will slap you.

429
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:26,042
Panda! Panda!

430
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:27,875
Stupid villager.

431
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,875
Stupid?

432
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,083
Yes, stupid.

433
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:31,167
- Villager?
- You.

434
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:33,292
You think you are a great Sardar?

435
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,542
Go for the Panda!

436
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:52,125
We have it under control.

437
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,583
Mr. Jaggi, you are a
successful farmer from Punjab.

438
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:02,917
You should've done something
which you knew quite well.

439
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:04,583
I tried that as well.

440
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:06,000
Thrashing?

441
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:07,417
Farming.

442
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:10,922
- I am going on a Europe trip for ten days.
- Okay.

443
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:12,963
And I think I can leave
the farm in your hands.

444
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,042
Yes, Brother Vicky.

445
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:15,625
But remember one thing, Jaggi.

446
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,542
This is one of the
rising farms of Australia.

447
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:18,917
Don't cause any problem.

448
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:20,208
Okay.

449
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,292
Okay, see you guys.

450
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:22,167
- Okay.
- Enjoy.

451
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,667
Thank you for the job, Brother.

452
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,625
- Good luck.
- Bye.

453
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:29,922
Come, Brother Vicky.

454
00:32:30,042 --> 00:32:31,292
I have a big surprise for you.

455
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,792
What are you feeding the plants?

456
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:42,917
Organic manure. I made it.

457
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:48,583
Dried leaves, used tea powder.
Raw eggs, buttermilk..

458
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:52,833
You will see how good it is, Brother.

459
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:53,750
Have a look.

460
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:01,042
A juice for our plants.

461
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:06,708
Pick up that bag
and use that fertilizer.

462
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,042
Don't ruin my plants.

463
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,833
Boss, he knows what he is doing.

464
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:14,500
He is a genius.

465
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,917
Let him try.

466
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:20,083
Rosemary, I have done my degrees from
Agriculture University of Australia.

467
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,042
So don't try to teach me.

468
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,583
Brother, you will get
double growth for sure.

469
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:27,167
My great grandfather too
used to use the same manure.

470
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:30,833
Bimla madam had praised this manure
in the serial 'My village, My fields.'

471
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,875
You have worked enough. Out now.

472
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,417
Don't fire me.

473
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:36,333
I like this job.

474
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:38,292
I am also a farmer.

475
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,667
To hell with you,
your grandfather..

476
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:43,000
..your great grandfather
and your entire village.

477
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:45,292
And may your Jalandhar
Doordarshan go down the drain.

478
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,583
I won't even tolerate
my grandfather's insult..

479
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:50,042
..and you dared to insult
Jalandhar Doordarshan!

480
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,542
1.5 crores in 20 days.

481
00:33:57,042 --> 00:33:59,125
You can get that only
by stealing from a bank.

482
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,750
Talk softly, Madam.

483
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:05,042
If Athra hears it,
he will go straight to the bank.

484
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,375
Don't worry about the money.

485
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:10,375
You just write a report
which makes the police say..

486
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:12,833
..that Jaggi can work anywhere
now without getting angry.

487
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:16,167
The anger management report
for which court has sent you here..

488
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,042
Yes?

489
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:18,792
I will handle that.

490
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,917
Thank you very much.

491
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:20,958
Don't worry.

492
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:23,000
- Can I leave then?
- Yes.

493
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:26,542
Oh yes, I forgot to tell
you the most important thing.

494
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:29,625
The thing I told you about
" Jaggi is naive, Jaggi is mad?"

495
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,875
You should file that as well.

496
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,917
It comes in handy in official matters.

497
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:35,125
Okay.

498
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,417
Bye. Thank you.

499
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,375
See you on Monday.

500
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,333
Okay. Bye.

501
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:08,375
Stop staring.

502
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,250
This is how girls dress here.

503
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:15,875
Listen up, you rustic!

504
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:18,542
They shamelessly come to Australia.

505
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,625
I am sure you must have
come through Indonesia.

506
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:21,875
In a boat.

507
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:24,292
Bloody illegal.

508
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,000
Ma'am, the ticket for Australia
from New Delhi is for 65,000.

509
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,833
I still have it with me.

510
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:31,542
I will be back here
on Monday for check-up.

511
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,375
If you want, I can show it to you.

512
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,375
Villagers like you even hold
on to movie tickets for two years.

513
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:39,833
You must have kept the
flight tickets in a bank locker.

514
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:45,125
Oh, but you can only get a bank
locker if you have a bank account.

515
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,708
Bloody 10 dollars per hour worker.

516
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,042
" Toys for the girls.
Turban for my brother."

517
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:51,667
" Stole for my sister-in-law.
And Zilch for the son-in-law."

518
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:54,083
" Toys for the girls.
Turban for my brother."

519
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,125
He got scared.

520
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You cannot hide such things.
Such things don't stay hidden.

521
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,792
They slowly make their
way to the village.

522
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:34,458
Did the buffalo give
birth to a three headed calf..

523
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,458
..that the news would
reach my village?

524
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,750
Don't exaggerate everything.

525
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:41,250
I am very upset.

526
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,583
As long as I can remember,
there was no other person over there.

527
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:48,125
Where is your pride?
You left it back in the village?

528
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,958
It's not such a big thing, Brother.

529
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,583
2-4 % of beautiful girls are cruel.

530
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:53,792
She was one of them.

531
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:56,958
1-2% of boys are also
opportunists and impudent.

532
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:59,792
And you are one of them.

533
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:20,042
Tell me, what is the case?

534
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:21,963
- Doctor, Soni is sitting outside.
- Okay.

535
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,625
She is my elder sister's daughter.

536
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,292
" Your time is up. My time is now."

537
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:37,250
" You can see me, girl.
I am shining now."

538
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:39,708
She has an anger
problem since childhood.

539
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:43,000
What's so great if this
is how girls dress in Australia?

540
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:44,583
Your top is worth 5 dollars.

541
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:46,958
Your ripped jeans is worth 10 dollars.

542
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:50,000
It shouldn't be a big
deal if I checked you out.

543
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,167
Weren't you checking me out?

544
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:52,625
Do you have cataract?

545
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,875
We have consulted many doctors.

546
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
But her condition has become
worse since the past one year.

547
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:01,792
You worthless illegal,
you are taunting me?

548
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,042
Whether I come via
Indonesia or Honolulu..

549
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:11,000
..why does it cause you a heart ache?

550
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,375
Okay.

551
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,000
Does she do a job or does she study?

552
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,750
She teaches Judo and Karate to kids.

553
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,667
Whether or not my heart aches,
but yours surely will.

554
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:29,750
Don't worry.

555
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,375
We usually get disturbed patients.

556
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:33,375
Especially men.

557
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:35,583
" Your time is up. My time is now."

558
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,917
" You can see me, girl.
I am shining now."

559
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,792
Doctor, I must say,
Soni is quite sensitive.

560
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:51,292
We have some exercises
to control the anger.

561
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:55,458
Doctor, we have taught Soni
to count backwards from ten to one.

562
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,417
Oh, that's very good.

563
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,042
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

564
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:01,750
Well done, tigress!

565
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,417
Now this will be fun.

566
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:07,333
But she finishes
the count very quickly.

567
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:12,542
Common problem.
Don't worry. Please call her in.

568
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:17,708
" Toys for the girls.
Turban for my brother."

569
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,458
" Stole for my sister-in-law.
And Zilch for the son-in-law."

570
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:21,042
" Toys for the girls.
Turban for my brother."

571
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:22,042
" Stole for my sister-in-law.
And Zilch for the son-in-law."

572
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,292
" Toys for the girls.
Turban for my brother."

573
00:39:26,292 --> 00:39:27,583
I am sorry, Jaggi.

574
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:29,500
I cannot lie any more.

575
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,833
Now you will have to go to court.

576
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:46,958
Dr. Teena, would you like to
say something on behalf of the client?

577
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,125
Yes, Your Honor.

578
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:57,125
You said that you would handle it.

579
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,250
I will.

580
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,875
Your Honor, Jaggi is naive.
Jaggi is mad.

581
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,125
You cannot be mad at a mad man.

582
00:40:08,292 --> 00:40:11,208
Doctor, could you please
explain to me what he is saying?

583
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,083
Yes, Your Honor.

584
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,333
He's simply trying to say that..

585
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:20,167
" I am a mad man and nobody
should be mad at a mad man."

586
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:21,208
Yes.

587
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:29,958
He is laughing.

588
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,167
How cute.

589
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:35,625
This always works.
I have tried it before.

590
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,333
Doctor, please explain this to him.

591
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,208
Thank you.

592
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:49,125
What does the judge say?

593
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,542
Is he happy with me?

594
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:56,250
Judge said that you will
have to do a community service job.

595
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,792
You will have to do a job
in which you have to deal with kids.

596
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,958
To increase your patience level.

597
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:05,583
To control your anger.

598
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:07,458
I will have to become a teacher?

599
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,000
You have to sell ice cream.

600
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:21,042
I have to sell ice cream?

601
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:26,792
Okay. Community punishment.

602
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:30,542
So the judge has given
you community punishment.

603
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:37,750
I always get such kind of people.

604
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:39,417
Fine.

605
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:42,042
I will give you the ice cream truck.

606
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,333
Monthly rent will be 1000 dollars.

607
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:46,958
Can you pay it?

608
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:48,875
'I don't even know whether
or not I will be here for a month.'

609
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:49,875
Speak up.

610
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,833
Yes, I can.

611
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:52,042
Then why don't you say so?

612
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:53,750
- I am now.
- " I am now."

613
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,792
This is the problem
with you fledglings.

614
00:41:56,042 --> 00:41:59,042
You understand neither
Punjabi nor English.

615
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,667
That is indeed a problem.

616
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:03,333
It's not a problem, you will learn.

617
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:05,333
But what's the use of learning it?

618
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:06,792
I didn't gain anything.

619
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:08,125
Can I sit, Auntie?

620
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,583
Sit down. It's meant for sitting.

621
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:11,875
Thank you.

622
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:14,083
So..

623
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:22,875
Son, after my father-in-law,
my husband..

624
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,083
- ..used this truck.
- Okay.

625
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:31,917
- A single scratch on it..
- Okay.

626
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:35,833
Okay, Auntie.

627
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:39,125
Any other condition, Auntie?

628
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:42,083
Hello?

629
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:45,042
I accept your conditions, Auntie.

630
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:52,333
She is dead.

631
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:54,917
I will have to go back to court?

632
00:42:55,292 --> 00:42:56,625
Run, Jaggi Singh.

633
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:59,750
You were leaving the evidence behind.

634
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,292
You will have to pay a fine
if there is a single scratch on it.

635
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,250
Okay, Auntie.

636
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,625
The keys are in front of
the photo next to the fridge.

637
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:13,880
- Take it.
- Okay.

638
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,667
There is a uniform too.

639
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:18,083
You will have to wear it.

640
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:19,625
Move aside.

641
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,292
Hello.
I am Chindo.

642
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:51,083
I welcome you to this truck.

643
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:52,833
I will be your guide.

644
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:55,750
Find out the temperature
outside and also let me know.

645
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:58,208
So that I know, whether I
should take a stole or a blanket.

646
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:01,375
Inside news,
you cannot race in this truck.

647
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:03,458
Because it heats up after hitting 60.

648
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,042
" She sways like a snake."

649
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:20,958
" She steals glances
and laughs a little."

650
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:25,708
" She sways like a snake."

651
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,583
" She steals glances
and laughs a little."

652
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:29,500
" The one who laughs is
the one who gets trapped."

653
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,375
" My heart is making guesses."

654
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,167
" Locally brewed liquor.."

655
00:44:37,292 --> 00:44:39,083
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

656
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,922
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

657
00:44:41,042 --> 00:44:42,875
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

658
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,750
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

659
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:46,708
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

660
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:48,667
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

661
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:52,167
" locally brewed liquor.."

662
00:44:52,792 --> 00:44:54,333
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

663
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,542
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

664
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:13,542
" Catty eyes, rosy cheeks, they target
my heart your eyes are so stealth."

665
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,375
" Listen O' Chick,
my heart skips a beat.."

666
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:22,583
"with bated breath
your presence I seek."

667
00:45:22,917 --> 00:45:26,375
" You pretend to be bold
baby listen just I told.."

668
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,208
" The effect of your beauty.."

669
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:34,292
" Locally brewed liquor.."

670
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:36,208
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

671
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,125
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

672
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,005
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

673
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:41,875
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

674
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,833
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

675
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,963
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

676
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:47,792
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

677
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:49,625
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

678
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,500
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

679
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,458
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

680
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,833
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

681
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,125
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

682
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:08,333
" She swims like a fish."
" She flies like a butterfly."

683
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:14,500
" She wants a husband who
buys her Prada and diamonds."

684
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:19,667
" To keep her impressed,
I boost my chest."

685
00:46:19,792 --> 00:46:23,500
" She feels shy when she looks at me."

686
00:46:23,958 --> 00:46:27,542
" Locally brewed liquor.."

687
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,542
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

688
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,417
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

689
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:33,292
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

690
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:35,250
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

691
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,005
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

692
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,125
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

693
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:41,042
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

694
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:43,005
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

695
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:44,880
" She is like locally brewed liquor.."

696
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,375
" I keep getting into a naughty mood."

697
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:04,500
Jaggi..

698
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:11,042
Five years ago, we suffered
a loss in our transport business.

699
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:17,375
During that period, your
uncle met with someone called Teja.

700
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:21,833
We took a loan of 500,000
dollars from him and got trapped.

701
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:26,625
We paid him every dollar back.

702
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:32,167
His men had come home last
night to take more dollars.

703
00:47:33,708 --> 00:47:34,667
Uncle..

704
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,625
You don't need to be scared of anyone.

705
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,042
Shut up, Jaggi.

706
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:41,208
Issues here don't
get resolved so easily.

707
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:42,875
You are talking like this is Punjab.

708
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,083
That's what I am saying.

709
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:45,292
If you have to suffer
like this here too..

710
00:47:45,417 --> 00:47:46,667
..then what is the
use of coming to Australia?

711
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:48,792
We will report it to the police.

712
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:55,125
Teja has threatened me that if
I go to the police then Shiny will..

713
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:57,833
We cannot go to them.

714
00:47:58,167 --> 00:47:59,458
You don't know him.

715
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:01,625
He is a well-known goon of this city.

716
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,917
You should use your brains sometimes.

717
00:48:27,125 --> 00:48:31,958
We are not petty street
goons who keep threatening people.

718
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:33,375
I am sorry, Brother.

719
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,208
Enough.

720
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:37,042
Stop yapping in
English in front of me.

721
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:39,500
I am already surrounded
by enough English-speaking people.

722
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,625
I feel like shooting you.

723
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:46,500
Why didn't you just kidnap the child?

724
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:49,083
Don't get angry, please.

725
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:51,458
You know that you get
a sprain when you get angry.

726
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:52,750
Don't worry.

727
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:55,667
If we don't get the dollars today..

728
00:48:55,792 --> 00:48:57,708
..then we will kidnap his child.

729
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,083
Change the topic. Change the topic.

730
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,125
Billa Steel owner said that
production isn't taking place.

731
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:06,917
Tell me, what should I do?

732
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:17,042
Scholars say that those who
haven't seen Lahore haven't lived.

733
00:49:17,292 --> 00:49:19,750
And I am someone who
hasn't seen Peshawar.

734
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,833
It's a good thing
that I didn't see it.

735
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:28,750
Teja, today Pathan
will show you how to steal.

736
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:37,292
Uncle, I think we should
postpone this steal.

737
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:39,333
The situation seems tense inside.

738
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:42,083
Situation is always
tense in a goon's hideout.

739
00:49:42,417 --> 00:49:44,292
We haven't come to a piles'
doctor to get medicines..

740
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:46,375
..where we will find
silence and quiet.

741
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:50,417
Uncle, no one talks
at a piles' doctor's clinic?

742
00:49:50,542 --> 00:49:54,250
No, people only sigh.

743
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:58,208
This illness is such that
people can make sad faces..

744
00:49:58,458 --> 00:50:00,667
..but he cannot tell anyone
about it out of shame.

745
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:04,167
Uncle, you know in great
detail about this disease.

746
00:50:05,542 --> 00:50:07,667
Stop your nonsense.

747
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,375
Do you doubt me?

748
00:50:15,792 --> 00:50:17,333
Quickly throw the anesthesia bombs.

749
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:42,250
Who is this idiot? Stupid fellow.

750
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,625
Hey!
Who are you?

751
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:00,458
How did you come inside?

752
00:51:01,042 --> 00:51:03,708
Stop asking for money
from Pratap Singh Transporter.

753
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:05,083
Are you his uncle?

754
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:06,542
No, he is my uncle.

755
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:09,917
I am getting treated for my neck.

756
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:11,125
Your neck will get treated..

757
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,922
..but for broken bones you
will have to take precautions.

758
00:51:13,042 --> 00:51:16,542
If any of your men go to Pratap
Singh's house to ask for money..

759
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:18,792
..then I will also take
the money you have been counting.

760
00:51:18,917 --> 00:51:20,875
And I will also take the
money you still have to count.

761
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:22,208
Do you understand?

762
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:23,917
Did you get me?

763
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:45,042
You summoned me, Mr. Jaggi?

764
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:46,458
Why would I summon you?

765
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:48,625
I am not fighting with anyone
over here that I would summon you.

766
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:51,458
You think you will become
a dacoit if you dress up in black?

767
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:52,625
You made me forget the count.

768
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,542
May I say something? Chill a little.

769
00:51:55,708 --> 00:52:01,000
Even if you count 200 dollars 200
times, it will stay remain the same.

770
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:02,708
These are my dollars.

771
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:04,208
I can count them a thousand times,
if I want.

772
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:05,667
Let's go, you idiot.

773
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:07,042
It's just a five
minutes drive from here.

774
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:10,500
If we take 1.5 crores to
our village then it won't kill Teja.

775
00:52:10,917 --> 00:52:13,125
We won't get a better
opportunity, stupid.

776
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:14,500
Okay, so I am stupid.

777
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:15,917
And you are a scholar.

778
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:18,042
You have libraries
here under your name.

779
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,500
You always keep scheming
of ways of getting me thrashed.

780
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:22,625
I'll die but I won't take money
earned illicitly back to my village.

781
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:25,917
You are saying such
intelligent things.

782
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,625
I hope you don't have blood cancer.

783
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:32,375
That isn't Teja's hard-earned money.

784
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,375
He swindled that money out of people.

785
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,625
Go away.

786
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:36,792
Go out for a stroll or something.

787
00:52:37,042 --> 00:52:38,792
Fresh air will refresh your mind.

788
00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:40,667
It will get rid of
the filth in your mind.

789
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,292
It doesn't hurt me, Brother.

790
00:52:42,417 --> 00:52:43,708
The whole village is waiting for you.

791
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:45,792
There are just a few days left.

792
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:48,458
You will lose Mogi
and also the land there.

793
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:50,792
You are naive yet you
should think about it.

794
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:55,917
It's people's money and
we are giving it back to people.

795
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:01,083
Well now, the decision rests on you.

796
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:03,042
I shall always support you.

797
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:05,125
Summon me whenever you want to.

798
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,125
Well, your wish.

799
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:10,042
Listen..

800
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:13,208
Go away.

801
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:14,625
Whatever.

802
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:23,667
Hello?

803
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:25,375
Can I talk to Jaggi?

804
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:27,500
Uncle, you should look
at the time before you call.

805
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:29,208
Some people also have to sleep.

806
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:31,625
Hang up, Shiny.
Don't make me beat you up.

807
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,625
Yes Brother,
whom do you wish to talk to?

808
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,042
Aslam!

809
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:20,375
Wait.

810
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:21,833
Stop.

811
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:25,542
- Get down.
- Nimma, look over there.

812
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,542
One liter.

813
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:29,625
- Hurry up!
- Why soldier?

814
00:54:30,042 --> 00:54:31,500
Your friend is abroad.

815
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:33,667
Yet you are being
are buying just a liter?

816
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:37,417
He must've sent you many
bags full of dollars by now.

817
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:41,750
You should've linked a pipe directly
from the well the petrol pump.

818
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:54,250
Jaggi?

819
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:56,125
I am coming back with the money.

820
00:54:57,042 --> 00:54:58,500
Really, Brother?

821
00:54:58,625 --> 00:54:59,583
Wonderful.

822
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:04,083
" She comes riding a truck."
" She wishes me good luck."

823
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,583
Listen..

824
00:55:09,792 --> 00:55:10,542
Go on.

825
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:13,667
Get the tenner's ready
to shower them on the stage.

826
00:55:13,792 --> 00:55:15,542
I have lots of money.

827
00:55:17,042 --> 00:55:21,542
We will make a huge poster of yours.

828
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:26,167
Don't forget anything.
I have lots of money.

829
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:34,458
Uncle, stealing isn't
something meant for us.

830
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:38,042
I had told you we should start
the business of making pirated CDs.

831
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:42,750
Now in Pakistan people also
like Tollywood along with Bollywood.

832
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:44,750
Scholars say that those who
haven't seen Lahore haven't been born.

833
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:47,042
And those who haven't seen Peshawar,
they did a good thing.

834
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:48,708
For God's sake, Uncle.

835
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:52,083
We are Pakistanis. We have
seen Lahore as well as Peshawar.

836
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:53,963
Why do you keep repeating that to me?

837
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:56,500
I don't keep telling you.
It just flows out of my mouth.

838
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:58,167
It is my catchphrase.

839
00:55:58,542 --> 00:56:01,583
Uncle Pathan's gang
won't give up so easily.

840
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:02,917
They will charge inside.

841
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:04,000
Let's go.

842
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,792
This means someone had preplanned it.

843
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:22,083
It's the same man
who had come yesterday.

844
00:56:26,792 --> 00:56:28,292
Find this boy immediately.

845
00:56:28,917 --> 00:56:30,208
He is around 26-27 years old.

846
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:32,167
He drives an ice cream truck.

847
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:33,500
Find him quickly.

848
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:37,250
The thief already got robbed.

849
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:41,750
Oh my fate, what I sow
and what do you make me reap.

850
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:45,833
Uncle, I had told you stealing
isn't something meant for us.

851
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:48,125
Then do what you can do.

852
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:50,417
Find the Punjabi boy
who is selling ice creams.

853
00:56:50,542 --> 00:56:51,167
Let's go.

854
00:56:57,167 --> 00:57:01,333
'Aunt..'

855
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:03,458
'The day I had been waiting
for since the past one year has come.'

856
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:04,958
'I'll take care of something
important and come back. Don't worry.'

857
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,875
- Longford.
- Longford.

858
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Wait..I will write.

859
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:20,000
I have fulfilled
the purpose of my visit.

860
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:21,750
I have booked the ticket.

861
00:57:22,042 --> 00:57:23,750
I didn't have much time.

862
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:26,792
I will do a small job
and then go back to India.

863
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,750
I will call once I reach Punjab.

864
00:57:29,042 --> 00:57:30,083
Goodbye.

865
00:57:30,542 --> 00:57:31,917
Lots of love to Shiny.

866
00:57:33,042 --> 00:57:33,792
Hello.

867
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:36,000
Your destination is
thousands of kilometers away.

868
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:38,208
I too have never traveled
such a long distance.

869
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:13,750
Uncle, I have already
eaten eight samosas.

870
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,417
I have punctured six wrong cars.

871
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:16,922
Are you even going to come here?

872
00:58:17,042 --> 00:58:18,417
Police can show up anytime.

873
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:21,125
No, the ice cream truck
is still to come here.

874
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:23,042
Wait..

875
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,792
I know you.

876
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:40,333
Do you have a jack.

877
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,750
You must be feeling a
little embarrassed to ask..

878
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:47,333
..an illegal 10 dollars
per hour worker for a jack.

879
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:48,667
Get lost.

880
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:50,375
No one wants to argue with you.

881
00:58:53,292 --> 00:58:55,250
Listen..

882
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,083
Illegals are also human being, right?

883
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,542
They too have rights.

884
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,458
That's enough of
butter to fry anything.

885
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:10,042
Now left me tell you something
bluntly. I am so sorry.

886
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:11,250
I too don't have a jack.

887
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:15,333
Then, you give me a lift.

888
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:16,208
Hello.

889
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:20,833
What are you doing?

890
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,708
Let's go.

891
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:23,833
Get lost.

892
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:26,583
Get down, I say!

893
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:29,375
She hopped into the
truck like a monkey.

894
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:31,583
Can't you hear me?

895
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:35,917
Six..five.. four..three..

896
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:40,167
Now scratch your head
with your other hand.

897
00:59:42,042 --> 00:59:43,125
Now show me all your teeth.

898
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,083
Scratch your head too.

899
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:47,792
Yes, now you look like a monkey.

900
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,667
Just staying in Australia
doesn't make you smart.

901
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:52,333
You become smart after you wander
around and behave like a monkey.

902
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:59,417
If you don't eat snacks
and Manchurian at a wedding..

903
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:00,958
..then there no use of going to one.

904
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:06,042
Now what?

905
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:08,917
That poor girl wants a lift.

906
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:10,792
Let's give her a lift.

907
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,667
- You will make us late.
- Stop troubling me.

908
01:00:14,042 --> 01:00:15,750
I am just giving her a
lift and not taking her home.

909
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:18,917
- Yes?
- Hi.

910
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:20,208
Hello Sister, where do you wish to go?

911
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,375
Don't get smart with me.

912
01:00:22,667 --> 01:00:23,792
Get out of the van.

913
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:28,833
What does she say?
She wants to sit in the middle?

914
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,917
She says quietly get out of the car.

915
01:00:31,042 --> 01:00:32,625
Otherwise, she will shoot us.

916
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,708
Doomed.

917
01:00:46,667 --> 01:00:47,833
Where are my dollars?

918
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:53,250
Relax.

919
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:55,250
Which dollars?

920
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:56,458
Have you lost your mind?

921
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:01,042
You will have to
give me back my dollars.

922
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,833
I think he has lost his mind.

923
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,917
Which dollars are you talking about?

924
01:01:04,042 --> 01:01:05,625
Will you pay while you
are still alive or after you die?

925
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:11,042
I think you are better off if
you return them while you are alive.

926
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,833
No, these are just words.
It is not so beneficial.

927
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:18,042
Return Teja's 3 lakh dollars!

928
01:01:18,417 --> 01:01:20,750
Tell me,
where are Teja's 3 lakh dollars!

929
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:22,917
Tell me,
where are Teja's 3 lakh dollars!

930
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:26,333
Don't get angry, Brother.
You will get a sprain.

931
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:40,000
What is wrong with him?

932
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:42,625
Change the topic.. Change the topic.

933
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,875
Don't worry, Brother.
We will find your dollars.

934
01:01:46,042 --> 01:01:48,292
You are wearing such
a nice velvet jacket.

935
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:50,375
Calm down.
We will find it.

936
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,333
We will find your dollars, Brother.
We will find them.

937
01:01:53,542 --> 01:01:55,917
Your velvet jacket will get ruined.

938
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:58,000
I think we should go back.

939
01:01:58,125 --> 01:02:01,000
The ice cream man has an
armed man lying on the floor.

940
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:02,792
Our guns don't even
have bullets in them.

941
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,880
- Your money isn't going anywhere.
- We will find them, velvet guy.

942
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,458
Hurry up, Jaggi, please.

943
01:02:06,667 --> 01:02:08,958
Police car.
Forget him. Let's go.

944
01:02:09,167 --> 01:02:10,333
Let's go.

945
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:13,417
Get up.

946
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:16,917
Don't worry.
I'll take you to the hospital.

947
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:22,458
What?

948
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,958
What kind of a business
have you gotten yourself into?

949
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:30,042
I thought you were a hardworking man.

950
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:33,375
If it is bad to help a lonely
girl standing on a deserted street..

951
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:34,667
..then I am bad.

952
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:36,542
I am not talking about that girl.

953
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:37,963
I am talking about those goons.

954
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:39,333
The ones who were
asking you for dollars.

955
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:41,458
I don't know what dollars
where they talking about.

956
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:42,250
Yes, of course.

957
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:45,125
You stole to become rich overnight.
Bloody criminal.

958
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:46,167
Hello..

959
01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:48,542
..I don't have any desire to become
rich by stealing someone's money.

960
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:50,875
I have five acres close to the well.
And two acres near the Mogi.

961
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,458
I have Basmati worth 3.5 lakhs.
And vegetables worth 50,000.

962
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,500
My annual income is 4 lakh rupees.

963
01:02:56,083 --> 01:02:57,667
I lead an honest hard working life.

964
01:02:57,833 --> 01:02:58,583
Hear her talk.

965
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,125
Money doesn't make anyone rich.

966
01:03:00,542 --> 01:03:01,963
Your intentions make you rich.

967
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:03,963
You can shout in
front of someone else.

968
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:06,583
I feel embarrassed
to sit in a truck with you.

969
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:07,875
You feel embarrassed?

970
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,458
Wonderful.

971
01:03:08,667 --> 01:03:10,375
I thought you know
only Judo and Karate.

972
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:11,750
You..!

973
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:13,375
Don't talk to me.

974
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:15,833
Why should I talk to you?

975
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,458
To talk to you, I will have
to climb on top of the truck.

976
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:20,083
Your face is on the third floor.

977
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,708
And you also have this perky nose.

978
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:24,750
Don't bark.

979
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,583
Drop me at the wedding and get lost.

980
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:29,750
Use your brains too like
you use your hands and legs.

981
01:03:30,292 --> 01:03:31,250
You are going to attend a wedding..

982
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:34,000
..dressed as a tractor
workshop mechanic.

983
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:35,875
People don't wear jeans
while attending parties.

984
01:03:40,292 --> 01:03:42,208
I am not going to attend that wedding.

985
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,042
I am going there to call it off.

986
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:54,792
Hello?

987
01:03:55,042 --> 01:03:56,208
Bloody Ms. Arrogant.

988
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:04,875
The one who gets two people
married is a marriage broker.

989
01:04:05,167 --> 01:04:07,083
So what do we call someone
who stops a wedding?

990
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:12,167
It must be getting you good money.

991
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,417
Accept it.

992
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,922
The way you have argued with me.

993
01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:18,000
I shouldn't even thank
you for giving me a lift.

994
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:20,583
- Accept it, you get good money, right?
- Get lost, you idiot.

995
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:24,917
Anyway, I am not
going to get any money.

996
01:04:27,917 --> 01:04:29,375
What's wrong with this tyre now?

997
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,583
Won't you ask me why do
I wish to break this wedding?

998
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:43,000
Do you think that I am crazy?

999
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:44,667
Why would I ask you?

1000
01:04:44,917 --> 01:04:46,167
Go and do your job.

1001
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:49,417
Rajveer is the guy I was engaged to.

1002
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,833
But I didn't get married to him.

1003
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,458
Then he got saved.

1004
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:01,922
You deserve to seek revenge.
Go and seek your revenge.

1005
01:05:02,042 --> 01:05:03,458
No, you can come with me.

1006
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:08,417
You are the pest for which
one needs experts' advice.

1007
01:05:08,542 --> 01:05:10,292
Handle your own business.

1008
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:12,875
You..
You suck..!

1009
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:15,375
At life!

1010
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:16,833
Hardcore!

1011
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:18,708
Go away!
Get lost!

1012
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:21,375
Otherwise, I'll put your nose
in this spanner and make it crocked.

1013
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:22,917
Hear her talk.

1014
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:10,708
You are troubling
the one who helped you.

1015
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,292
I gave you a lift
and you stole my keys!

1016
01:06:30,042 --> 01:06:30,708
Hello.

1017
01:06:32,167 --> 01:06:34,083
A wedding is about
to break in Australia.

1018
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:37,500
Will it be entertaining?

1019
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:42,000
A cold Coca-Cola and a
hot chick stopping a marriage.

1020
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:43,922
It's a long journey.

1021
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:45,750
A little entertainment
will do me no harm.

1022
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,167
Someone serve me a cold Coke.

1023
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:01,833
Hello!

1024
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:04,125
Congratulations.

1025
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,167
Thank you.

1026
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:06,500
You look nervous.

1027
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:09,750
A saw a girl who looked familiar.

1028
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:11,833
Which girl looks familiar to you?

1029
01:07:13,292 --> 01:07:14,125
You are about to get married.

1030
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:16,125
Now stop getting familiar
with other girls.

1031
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,500
She is your sister-in-law.

1032
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,458
Stop following your sister-in-law.

1033
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:21,417
My sister-in-law is sitting
over there. Go there.

1034
01:07:21,542 --> 01:07:22,333
Okay.

1035
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:25,167
Where are you going?
There she is.

1036
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:26,792
That way.

1037
01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:28,833
He has forgotten that
he's the one getting married.

1038
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:33,750
Stop wandering around
and tell me what your plan is.

1039
01:07:36,458 --> 01:07:37,208
Plan?

1040
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:39,292
You don't have a plan?

1041
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:43,292
Now I'll have to
think of a plan as well?

1042
01:07:45,292 --> 01:07:46,542
You still didn't get dressed?

1043
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:48,458
What shit have you ordered for?

1044
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:49,583
The pajamas are short.

1045
01:07:49,792 --> 01:07:51,922
Stop being fuzzy and
go entertain the guests.

1046
01:07:52,042 --> 01:07:53,833
Listen, do you know
how to sing and dance?

1047
01:07:53,958 --> 01:07:55,917
" She learnt to fly under my sky.."

1048
01:07:56,042 --> 01:07:58,125
" Now she wishes builds a nest far away."
- Shut up!

1049
01:07:58,375 --> 01:07:59,583
A wedding is taking place here.

1050
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:00,708
No one has ditched anyone.

1051
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:03,000
Hold this.

1052
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,542
He thinks he is Sandhu Sikandar.

1053
01:08:22,083 --> 01:08:25,417
" You have refused
to wear Indian dresses."

1054
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:31,333
" You prefer to wear
ripped jeans instead."

1055
01:08:33,958 --> 01:08:36,833
" You have refused
to wear Indian dresses."

1056
01:08:37,042 --> 01:08:39,792
" You prefer to wear
ripped jeans instead."

1057
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,542
" How did glass diamonds become pure?"

1058
01:08:45,292 --> 01:08:48,667
" Here, my Pajamas got pulled up."

1059
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,667
" Here, my Pajamas got pulled up."

1060
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:55,250
" Here, my Pajamas got pulled up."

1061
01:09:09,542 --> 01:09:12,333
" Once you started getting
the wind of Chandigarh.."

1062
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:15,375
" You started posing
in front of the mirror."

1063
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:21,292
" You started posing
in front of the mirror."

1064
01:09:21,417 --> 01:09:24,167
" Once you started getting
the wind of Chandigarh.."

1065
01:09:24,292 --> 01:09:27,083
" You started posing
in front of the mirror."

1066
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:30,792
" All of a sudden
your stature changed."

1067
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:36,000
" Here, my Pajamas got pulled up."

1068
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:39,042
" Here, my Pajamas got pulled up."

1069
01:09:39,167 --> 01:09:42,375
" Here, my Pajamas got pulled up."

1070
01:09:57,167 --> 01:09:59,875
" You no longer wear hair extensions."

1071
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,750
" Your words are no
longer as sweet as sugar."

1072
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:11,708
" You no longer wear hair extensions."

1073
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,500
" Your words are no
longer as sweet as sugar."

1074
01:10:14,792 --> 01:10:18,000
" My love for you also changed."

1075
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:23,375
" Here, my Pajamas got pulled up."

1076
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:26,458
" Here, my Pajamas got pulled up."

1077
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:30,000
" Here, my Pajamas got pulled up."

1078
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:01,167
Where is sister-in-law?

1079
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:04,333
Go and find her.

1080
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:09,375
Come.

1081
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,792
Are you guys crazy?

1082
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:13,292
Is this a kidnapping?

1083
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:15,250
What is your name?

1084
01:11:15,542 --> 01:11:16,750
Jaggi Khuwala.

1085
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:19,333
You kidnapped me from my wedding?

1086
01:11:19,542 --> 01:11:20,417
Have you lost your mind?

1087
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:21,458
Are you insane?

1088
01:11:21,917 --> 01:11:23,167
How does she know so much about me?

1089
01:11:23,292 --> 01:11:25,333
The boy you were about
to get married to..

1090
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:27,083
He was married twice before me.

1091
01:11:27,292 --> 01:11:29,333
Don't think that I am lying, please.

1092
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:31,958
Rajveer has been
married thrice before?

1093
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:33,333
Yes, you are number four.

1094
01:11:33,542 --> 01:11:35,333
You won't even get the bronze medal.
Get in.

1095
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,375
No, I was just engaged to him.

1096
01:11:37,583 --> 01:11:41,833
I refused to marry him
after I found out about him.

1097
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:43,583
Congratulations, now you
have chances of getting the bronze.

1098
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:44,750
Get in.

1099
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,750
Rajveer would deceive
me in such a big way..

1100
01:11:50,208 --> 01:11:51,708
I never even dreamt about it.

1101
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:53,042
Will you get in the truck now?

1102
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,333
Help! Help!

1103
01:11:56,542 --> 01:11:58,583
- Has she lost her mind?
- Somebody.. somebody help!

1104
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:00,750
He's kidnapping me.

1105
01:12:04,667 --> 01:12:06,375
We are in no hurry
to get inside the truck.

1106
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:17,167
Go inside.

1107
01:12:18,708 --> 01:12:20,708
Yes, no problem.
We can go inside and talk.

1108
01:12:21,042 --> 01:12:22,708
We are in no hurry
to get inside the truck.

1109
01:12:25,917 --> 01:12:27,375
Stop elbowing me.

1110
01:12:27,792 --> 01:12:29,667
I am not the one
who got married twice.

1111
01:12:29,917 --> 01:12:30,792
Hello.

1112
01:12:31,167 --> 01:12:34,292
What do you think that
I have got married twice?

1113
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:35,583
She thinks so, Brother.

1114
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:37,750
I stayed back only
for entertainment show.

1115
01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:42,750
- Stay there.
- Listen to me.

1116
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:45,375
This is the photograph
of our engagement function.

1117
01:12:49,417 --> 01:12:50,833
She is lying.

1118
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:52,917
I have not been married twice..

1119
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:55,958
I have been married three times.

1120
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:01,667
You were lucky to escape me.

1121
01:13:02,667 --> 01:13:05,458
Anyways, you all must be wondering..

1122
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:07,750
..the reason behind
my multiple marriages.

1123
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,458
I had a feeling that
this would be entertaining.

1124
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:16,958
You keep slogging the whole
day and you only make 100-200 dollars.

1125
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:22,792
It is easier to marry a girl
from Punjab and get 30-40 lakhs gift.

1126
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,792
Then for two years..

1127
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:27,042
Brother, for two years
you have the time of your life.

1128
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:28,292
Okay.

1129
01:13:29,042 --> 01:13:30,625
You get a kick..

1130
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:31,875
Yes.. Yes..

1131
01:13:32,292 --> 01:13:37,917
..when a naive innocent
girl begs you..

1132
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:41,583
- My shoulders are hurting.
- " Rajveer, don't leave me."

1133
01:13:42,958 --> 01:13:44,833
Can I sit down?

1134
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:48,458
That's it. That high..

1135
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:50,667
It's divine!

1136
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:53,125
I just love it sweetheart.

1137
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:56,583
Kill these emotional fools, okay?

1138
01:13:56,875 --> 01:13:58,208
- Okay.
- Okay.

1139
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,500
Sister-in-law left
for the second time?

1140
01:14:12,792 --> 01:14:14,042
Thank you, God.

1141
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:15,708
Thank you, Soni.

1142
01:14:16,042 --> 01:14:17,167
Thank you, Mr. Jaggi.

1143
01:14:17,292 --> 01:14:18,917
You really saved me today.

1144
01:14:19,292 --> 01:14:20,167
Are you done thanking everyone.

1145
01:14:20,792 --> 01:14:21,542
Get down now.

1146
01:14:22,042 --> 01:14:23,000
What?

1147
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:25,875
I would have been
dead because of you two.

1148
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:29,500
Whole village is waiting for
me and here I am stopping weddings.

1149
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:32,250
I am kidnapping brides.

1150
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:33,333
Wonderful.

1151
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:35,375
Now a successful farmer
is dodging bullets.

1152
01:14:35,625 --> 01:14:38,208
But where will I go now, Mr. Jaggi?

1153
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:39,542
I just don't know.

1154
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:41,833
I just sell ice creams.

1155
01:14:41,958 --> 01:14:43,667
I don't run an embroidery business..

1156
01:14:43,792 --> 01:14:45,125
..that I keep gathering females.

1157
01:14:45,292 --> 01:14:46,625
Fish model, get down.

1158
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:47,458
No.

1159
01:14:47,667 --> 01:14:48,667
Didn't you hear me?

1160
01:14:50,542 --> 01:14:53,083
- No, I won't.
- I told you to get down.

1161
01:14:54,125 --> 01:14:56,208
You don't know me, girl!

1162
01:14:57,042 --> 01:14:58,125
You threw my bag out!

1163
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:00,875
I say, get aside
or I will run you over.

1164
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,292
This isn't your village.

1165
01:15:02,417 --> 01:15:03,750
Do that and you will
rot in prison all your life.

1166
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:05,333
Prisons are like second home to us.

1167
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:06,125
Go scare someone else.

1168
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,375
You have been causing commotion..

1169
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,083
..from the time you
have sat inside the truck.

1170
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:11,458
I am helpless otherwise
forget sitting next to you..

1171
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:13,083
..I wouldn't even
talk to someone like you.

1172
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:14,708
As if you are a dentist!

1173
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:15,917
Bloody Ms. Arrogant.

1174
01:15:16,042 --> 01:15:18,708
Get lost, or I will do
what Rajveer intended to do.

1175
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:19,963
You will kill me?

1176
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:21,375
- Wait, I'll show you.
- You..

1177
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:26,458
Let go of each other.

1178
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:28,750
Side please.

1179
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,208
Seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one..

1180
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:35,292
Mr. Jaggi..

1181
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,922
Show me your hand.

1182
01:15:37,042 --> 01:15:37,708
Why?

1183
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,208
Please show me your hand.

1184
01:15:39,792 --> 01:15:41,000
I want to talk to you.

1185
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:43,000
You don't listen to me.

1186
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:46,667
Mr. Jaggi, you shouldn't get so angry.

1187
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:49,292
You should control
your anger a little.

1188
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,375
Just a little.

1189
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:52,833
Now close your eyes.

1190
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:56,000
Close your eyes.

1191
01:15:56,792 --> 01:15:59,458
Take a deep breath.

1192
01:15:59,583 --> 01:16:00,417
More.

1193
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:01,625
Some more.

1194
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:02,542
Some more.

1195
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:04,083
- Some more.
- I cannot anymore.

1196
01:16:04,292 --> 01:16:05,042
Okay, fine.

1197
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:07,583
Now calm yourself down a little.

1198
01:16:08,042 --> 01:16:09,208
Easy.

1199
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:12,292
Take a deep breath.

1200
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:17,875
Very slowly open your eyes.

1201
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:27,625
This humble servant is called Satkar.

1202
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:29,667
Why are you dressed in white?

1203
01:16:33,167 --> 01:16:34,667
Why have I never seen you before?

1204
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:39,125
You never thought about me, Mr. Jaggi.

1205
01:16:48,292 --> 01:16:49,750
Why have you come here now?

1206
01:16:50,292 --> 01:16:51,833
I have come to help you.

1207
01:16:54,292 --> 01:16:57,167
Hello, that is my job.

1208
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:59,875
I don't help in that way.

1209
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:01,583
Then how do you provide help?

1210
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:02,958
With love.

1211
01:17:06,458 --> 01:17:07,625
With love?

1212
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:12,292
Now I have double trouble.

1213
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:14,792
Oh damn.

1214
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:22,292
We will put up a huge poster!

1215
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,208
Hello?

1216
01:17:30,042 --> 01:17:32,000
I am sending it, Mom.
Give me some time.

1217
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:34,750
- Jaggi Khuwala.
- I will send it on both of them.

1218
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,458
An expert on organic farming.

1219
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:39,417
Interview has been shown
on Jalandhar Doordarshan.

1220
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:43,750
A farmer who cultivates crops
is kidnapping other people's bride.

1221
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:48,417
If Bimla madam finds out,
she will think that I am a goner.

1222
01:17:49,667 --> 01:17:50,833
Very stressful job.

1223
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,250
Your mom?

1224
01:17:54,042 --> 01:17:54,875
Yes.

1225
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,833
She must be asking for a photo.

1226
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,250
Of you and her son-in-law.

1227
01:18:00,625 --> 01:18:01,708
Send it.

1228
01:18:02,417 --> 01:18:04,625
I cannot even go back
home if I am not married.

1229
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,167
It's the same case with me.

1230
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:09,833
Anyway, my uncle and aunt won't
let me leave before I get married.

1231
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,958
Shall I say something?

1232
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:18,583
He is not bad either.

1233
01:18:18,792 --> 01:18:19,875
Who? Him?

1234
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:22,125
Jaggi? Are you mad?

1235
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:24,083
Not bad, he is very bad.

1236
01:18:25,042 --> 01:18:28,500
- If would have left us long back if he were bad.
- Oh my God!

1237
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:30,625
I'm in the company of another fool.

1238
01:18:30,917 --> 01:18:32,667
Enough of social work.

1239
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,833
You don't have any
feelings for him, do you?

1240
01:18:35,958 --> 01:18:36,667
Please!

1241
01:18:36,792 --> 01:18:39,667
I would prefer dying
than marrying him.

1242
01:18:42,458 --> 01:18:47,750
One can die for such an honest,
handsome Sikh.

1243
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:50,625
I am going to eat.

1244
01:18:51,292 --> 01:18:52,667
Come with me if you are hungry.

1245
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:54,333
Get down already.

1246
01:18:59,667 --> 01:19:02,583
Eat and then catch
a cab and go home. Okay?

1247
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:04,792
I have a very important work to do.
I'll have to leave. Bye.

1248
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,958
See you.
It was a pleasure to meet you.

1249
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,208
But..

1250
01:19:20,417 --> 01:19:23,833
Okay, we will call a cab.

1251
01:19:24,458 --> 01:19:26,250
But it will be of no use.

1252
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,583
Rajveer will catch us.

1253
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:31,875
Anyway, I don't have any cash with me.

1254
01:19:32,792 --> 01:19:34,750
I had told you to
let her accept gifts.

1255
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,875
But you were in a hurry
to break off her marriage.

1256
01:19:37,042 --> 01:19:38,625
Come with me, I will drop you off.

1257
01:19:39,083 --> 01:19:41,042
Mr. Jaggi.. listen?

1258
01:19:41,292 --> 01:19:42,750
Can I change my clothes?

1259
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:45,958
We might get caught quickly
if I stay dressed like this.

1260
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,167
Look at this.

1261
01:20:14,292 --> 01:20:17,250
One, two, three..

1262
01:20:17,792 --> 01:20:18,792
Four, five.

1263
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:20,750
Five are enough for the journey?

1264
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:21,708
No.

1265
01:20:21,833 --> 01:20:23,792
One handkerchief and
two nail polishes too.

1266
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:26,292
My hard-earned money is in the truck.

1267
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:30,333
I wish to make both of you realize..

1268
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,083
..that I have broken
off her marriage..

1269
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:33,792
I haven't adopted her.

1270
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:36,167
Okay then I won't take the
handkerchief and nail polishes.

1271
01:20:36,292 --> 01:20:37,333
I will manage.

1272
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:39,792
Sister has even footed
the bill for our meals.

1273
01:20:39,917 --> 01:20:41,042
Thank you.

1274
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,750
Hurry up, Dil.

1275
01:20:45,792 --> 01:20:46,708
Diljyot.

1276
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:00,750
Did you look at the time?

1277
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,333
Let's go!

1278
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:05,500
I say, girls are crazy.

1279
01:21:11,625 --> 01:21:14,292
" Things which I oppose, my dear."

1280
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:17,458
" You should agree with me on those,
my dear."

1281
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:20,500
" Things which I oppose, my dear."

1282
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:23,167
" You should agree with me on those,
my dear."

1283
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:26,458
" You are the one I like,
I will marry you."

1284
01:21:26,625 --> 01:21:30,333
" I won't jump off the
walls like thieves, my dear."

1285
01:21:32,542 --> 01:21:35,708
" Things which I oppose, my dear."

1286
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:38,875
" You should agree with me on those,
my dear."

1287
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,792
" Things which I oppose, my dear."

1288
01:21:41,917 --> 01:21:45,250
" You should agree with me on those,
my dear."

1289
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:03,125
" You like my looks.
You like my style."

1290
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:06,667
" You have a right to
every pleasure of mine."

1291
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,542
" Don't worry."

1292
01:22:10,667 --> 01:22:12,208
" Don't mind it."

1293
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:15,917
" I will make you mine,
by hook or crook."

1294
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:24,333
" The day I get married, the whole
market will shut down to celebrate."

1295
01:22:24,542 --> 01:22:27,375
" Things which I oppose, my dear."

1296
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:30,375
" You should agree with me on those,
my dear."

1297
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:33,417
" Things which I oppose, my dear."

1298
01:22:33,542 --> 01:22:36,542
" You should agree with me on those,
my dear."

1299
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,922
" I fulfill my promises."

1300
01:22:50,042 --> 01:22:51,458
" I like my weapons."

1301
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:55,333
" For the world I am star,
son of a Sardaar."

1302
01:22:57,625 --> 01:22:58,958
" I carry on my father's legacy."

1303
01:22:59,083 --> 01:23:00,458
" I am respected in my village."

1304
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:04,583
" I shall always
respect and honor you."

1305
01:23:05,167 --> 01:23:08,083
" Those households were respected.."

1306
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:11,292
"where bullets because of me."

1307
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:14,417
" Things which I oppose, my dear."

1308
01:23:14,542 --> 01:23:17,333
" You should agree with me on those,
my dear."

1309
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:27,667
" She came to meet
me in my truck at dawn."

1310
01:23:27,917 --> 01:23:30,667
" She wishes for my wellbeing."

1311
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:37,000
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Didn't you see?

1312
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:38,625
That lady is standing there all alone.

1313
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,000
I think she needs our help.

1314
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:43,292
I respect your heart which
is more delicate that an eyelid.

1315
01:23:43,417 --> 01:23:45,208
We have stopped the truck
once before for humanity sake.

1316
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:47,625
Not " we ", you had stopped it.

1317
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:50,333
Look how deadly she is,
just like a livewire.

1318
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:52,833
I had stopped the
truck for humanity sake.

1319
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:55,458
So many bullets were fired,
it was like a city lad..

1320
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:56,792
..playing the Contra video game.

1321
01:23:56,917 --> 01:24:00,125
She might have a genuine problem.
Please stop the truck.

1322
01:24:00,333 --> 01:24:03,167
Don't. Last time when he helped someone,
we got into trouble.

1323
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:09,792
Where do you wish to go, Sister?

1324
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,958
Get down.

1325
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:21,333
There is a saying in Peshawar,
if you have loose motions..

1326
01:24:21,792 --> 01:24:23,792
..you shouldn't tie
the drawstring tightly.

1327
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:28,375
If the men carry guns then
you shouldn't eye beautiful women.

1328
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,042
Happy helping now?

1329
01:24:31,708 --> 01:24:34,000
Now who will help us?

1330
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:40,583
God, I promise to be a nice guy.
Please save me and kill her.

1331
01:24:41,167 --> 01:24:43,333
Wonderful.

1332
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:46,833
A beautiful sight
and a wonderful journey.

1333
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:48,208
Millions of dollars..

1334
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:51,583
And two beauties to give you company.

1335
01:24:51,875 --> 01:24:55,000
You should have been in Saudi Arab.

1336
01:24:55,292 --> 01:24:57,083
I won't be able to
get dollars in Saudi Arab.

1337
01:24:57,208 --> 01:24:59,667
If you won't get dollars
there then it doesn't mean..

1338
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,667
..that you would steal Aadandyar
Sattar Khan Niazi's dollars.

1339
01:25:02,792 --> 01:25:04,625
I didn't steal anyone's dollars.

1340
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:07,005
There are just three of you
here and yet you said five names.

1341
01:25:07,125 --> 01:25:07,833
Don't confuse me, Uncle.

1342
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:11,042
Aadandyar Sattar
Khan Niazi is my name.

1343
01:25:11,542 --> 01:25:13,500
They are Asif and Rashid.

1344
01:25:15,042 --> 01:25:16,963
Brother with kohl in his eyes,
you look familiar.

1345
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:17,833
No.

1346
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:18,917
Yes, you are.

1347
01:25:19,917 --> 01:25:22,125
Okay Afsar Nayar Sitar Ali Khan..

1348
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,963
Aadandyar Sattar..

1349
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:25,333
You are making me forget as well.

1350
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:26,083
Forget it.

1351
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:28,542
You address me as uncle
Pathan and end this here itself.

1352
01:25:28,917 --> 01:25:31,333
Uncle Pathan,
I don't have millions of dollars.

1353
01:25:31,667 --> 01:25:33,042
I have just 135 dollars.

1354
01:25:33,167 --> 01:25:34,963
And five dollars worth change.

1355
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:35,625
Okay?

1356
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:38,042
Well, I didn't understand
what you said about the beauties.

1357
01:25:38,167 --> 01:25:41,500
But I think you meant that
I am traveling with two girls.

1358
01:25:41,708 --> 01:25:43,922
But that isn't such a big
crime that you should shoot me.

1359
01:25:44,042 --> 01:25:46,250
You crime isn't so small, kiddo..

1360
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:48,667
..that I should just
reprimand you and let you go.

1361
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,833
He won't listen to us.
Shoot at his thighs.

1362
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:52,042
No, Uncle.

1363
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:55,208
Don't get too hyper, Uncle.
We don't have any bullets with us.

1364
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:58,083
Stop your nonsense.
I am trying to scare them.

1365
01:25:58,417 --> 01:26:01,833
Uncle Pathan, I am not at fault.

1366
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:04,208
He kidnapped me.

1367
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:06,333
I am already in too much problem.

1368
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:07,500
Can I leave, please?

1369
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:08,542
Hello!

1370
01:26:08,792 --> 01:26:10,125
Both of you can leave.

1371
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:11,500
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

1372
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:12,292
Bloody Ms. Arrogant.

1373
01:26:12,583 --> 01:26:13,333
Hey!

1374
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:19,875
I will shoot you,
if I don't get my dollars.

1375
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,833
I will count till five because
I can count only till five.

1376
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:25,583
And I also keep
forgetting in the middle.

1377
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,667
- Five!
- No, Uncle. Start from one.

1378
01:26:29,875 --> 01:26:31,792
I like to count backwards.

1379
01:26:33,917 --> 01:26:34,917
Four!

1380
01:26:35,208 --> 01:26:36,083
Three!

1381
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,292
Two!

1382
01:26:37,417 --> 01:26:38,542
- One!
- Jaggi!

1383
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:43,125
Fire!

1384
01:26:43,625 --> 01:26:45,963
Uncle, I will hit you with
the gun if you say fire again!

1385
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:49,042
Okay, come on, hit me!

1386
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:07,208
Stop!

1387
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:10,958
It heats up if you
go above sixty. Stop!

1388
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:17,542
Mr. Jaggi, are you okay..
Are you fine?

1389
01:27:17,667 --> 01:27:19,708
I'll dust DTT on you, you witch!

1390
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:21,963
What are you doing?

1391
01:27:22,083 --> 01:27:23,417
Enjoying the weather.

1392
01:27:23,625 --> 01:27:25,000
I wonder what crimes did
I commit in my past life that..

1393
01:27:25,125 --> 01:27:26,667
..as a punishment I
let you get inside my truck.

1394
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:29,375
The whole of Australia
is chasing me with guns..

1395
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,750
..as if I have stolen
a marsupial's young one.

1396
01:27:32,292 --> 01:27:34,042
What's a marsupial, you idiot?

1397
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:37,250
The one which jumps with
a young one in its pouch.

1398
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:38,583
Mr. Jaggi, it's a kangaroo.

1399
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:39,708
Yes, that.

1400
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:44,542
Look, armed men are bound to follow
you if you steal millions of dollars.

1401
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:46,458
This is what usually
happens with thieves.

1402
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:49,083
I will tie you behind the ice
cream truck if you call me a thief.

1403
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:50,333
Really?

1404
01:27:50,458 --> 01:27:52,917
Mr. Jaggi, I believe that
you didn't steal the money.

1405
01:27:53,042 --> 01:27:54,750
But there has to be a reason..

1406
01:27:54,875 --> 01:27:56,922
..why so many people are
asking you for the dollars.

1407
01:27:57,042 --> 01:27:59,167
I don't know. I have to give
1.5 crores rupees back to my village.

1408
01:27:59,292 --> 01:28:01,125
Teja is asking me for 3 lakh dollars.

1409
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:03,292
Even Pathan wants dollars from me.

1410
01:28:03,958 --> 01:28:05,625
I am a successful farmer.

1411
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,125
I am not Western Union.

1412
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:10,333
All I know is, that I don't
want to sit in a thief's truck.

1413
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:13,000
I don't know what he sells
under the pretext of ice cream.

1414
01:28:13,292 --> 01:28:14,375
Shall I show you what I sell?

1415
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,167
Wait here.

1416
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:20,542
Here's strawberry.

1417
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:21,833
Here's Vanilla.

1418
01:28:22,042 --> 01:28:23,708
Here, eat mango ice cream.

1419
01:28:23,958 --> 01:28:25,292
Here, eat coffee ice cream.

1420
01:28:44,583 --> 01:28:46,875
Mr. Jaggi, from where
did you get so many dollars?

1421
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:50,292
Dollar!

1422
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,208
I don't wish to sit
in a robber's truck.

1423
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:53,667
Bloody thief.

1424
01:29:27,958 --> 01:29:30,375
Jaggi, don't stop the car,
police is following us.

1425
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:34,500
You have a bag full
of dollars kept back there.

1426
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:35,708
What are you waiting for now?

1427
01:29:35,917 --> 01:29:37,542
Turn the truck around towards home.

1428
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:40,833
According to me that
is a bag full of sin.

1429
01:29:41,083 --> 01:29:43,922
Let him make something of himself.

1430
01:29:44,042 --> 01:29:46,625
If he has the money,
he can buy some land and get married.

1431
01:29:46,833 --> 01:29:48,417
He will lead a successful life.

1432
01:29:48,542 --> 01:29:49,792
Jaggi, don't pay heed to him.

1433
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,625
Take the dollar and let's
go back to our village.

1434
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:53,667
We should follow
the path of patience..

1435
01:29:53,792 --> 01:29:56,042
..and contentment
to be successful in life.

1436
01:29:56,667 --> 01:29:57,708
What nonsense!

1437
01:29:57,833 --> 01:29:59,000
I will lay you down
and beat all patience..

1438
01:29:59,125 --> 01:30:00,458
..and contentment out of you.

1439
01:30:01,292 --> 01:30:05,125
Speak no evil, be polite and humble..

1440
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:07,250
Stop your nonsense.

1441
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:09,458
Leave.

1442
01:30:10,042 --> 01:30:11,083
I don't need you.

1443
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:14,250
Jaggi, my brother, the government
doesn't send the army home..

1444
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:16,458
..just because there
is no war at the border.

1445
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:18,667
It always keeps them at the border.
You never know when you might need them.

1446
01:30:18,792 --> 01:30:20,417
Then take retirement.

1447
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,042
I told you, leave.

1448
01:30:26,292 --> 01:30:27,125
Wonderful.

1449
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:28,875
What a great decision, Mr. Jaggi.

1450
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,333
You made the right decision.

1451
01:30:30,833 --> 01:30:31,750
You too should leave.

1452
01:30:32,167 --> 01:30:34,000
Go and attend a prayer
meeting somewhere.

1453
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:38,333
Both of them have
bloody made me go nuts.

1454
01:30:45,917 --> 01:30:48,250
Run us over!
Why did you stop?

1455
01:30:48,708 --> 01:30:50,292
The whole world is angry.

1456
01:30:50,792 --> 01:30:52,125
What is wrong? Why are you so angry?

1457
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:54,417
A person will be angry
if his house is being sold.

1458
01:30:54,542 --> 01:30:56,375
Go and mind your own business.

1459
01:31:07,583 --> 01:31:10,917
This is Chelsea Johns reporting live
from the Little Angels' Orphanage.

1460
01:31:11,167 --> 01:31:13,833
The auction has now begun.
What a sad day for the community.

1461
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:20,963
Why are you honking?

1462
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:22,917
If you want to give us free
ice creams then go ahead, Bro.

1463
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,625
You are harsh yet
you address me as bro.

1464
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:28,667
You seem to be smart, Sardaarji.

1465
01:31:35,042 --> 01:31:37,792
He too is smart, he includes " Ji"
while addressing someone as Sardaar.

1466
01:31:38,833 --> 01:31:39,880
What would you like, Sardaarji?

1467
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,083
This won't suffice.

1468
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:42,417
Give me the great flavor?

1469
01:31:42,542 --> 01:31:43,542
The great flavor?

1470
01:31:44,292 --> 01:31:46,000
- What?
- Coke float.

1471
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,958
- Coke float?
- Yes, give me Coke float.

1472
01:31:49,875 --> 01:31:51,000
Here's your coke.

1473
01:31:56,833 --> 01:31:58,583
What's going on out there?

1474
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:02,375
The one who used to
finance our office is dead.

1475
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:04,292
And now his son is throwing us out.

1476
01:32:04,542 --> 01:32:06,292
Today our Home is being auctioned.

1477
01:32:20,375 --> 01:32:21,333
Next!

1478
01:32:23,792 --> 01:32:24,875
Next!

1479
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:35,292
Next!

1480
01:32:44,375 --> 01:32:45,958
Wait a minute!

1481
01:33:04,625 --> 01:33:05,500
Sold!

1482
01:33:06,542 --> 01:33:07,500
To the kids!

1483
01:33:15,292 --> 01:33:17,000
Come on! Come on!

1484
01:33:17,208 --> 01:33:18,042
What's wrong?

1485
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:19,917
Sir, did you seriously
donate all that money?

1486
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:22,000
Go away, don't trouble me.

1487
01:33:22,125 --> 01:33:23,583
Thank you. I need to be somewhere.

1488
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:25,542
- I am already late.
- Where you going?

1489
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:27,042
You are poor guy.

1490
01:33:27,167 --> 01:33:28,333
Shall I show you who is a poor guy?

1491
01:33:28,458 --> 01:33:30,625
If I stop the truck, I will slap you.

1492
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,667
You know how the face turns red then.

1493
01:33:32,792 --> 01:33:36,042
I told you to go away.
Get lost or I will hit you.

1494
01:33:36,292 --> 01:33:38,708
- Sir.. please sir..
- Don't follow me.

1495
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,333
Noble Sikh.

1496
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:41,833
Noble Sikh.

1497
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,458
Sardaarji.

1498
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:47,375
Welcome to the special
edition of Sydney Harold.

1499
01:33:47,583 --> 01:33:50,583
How far would you go
to help your fellow man?

1500
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:54,375
This colorful individual
has been all over the news today..

1501
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:58,875
..after a video of his
intervention to save an orphanage..

1502
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,792
..went viral on the internet today.

1503
01:34:02,042 --> 01:34:05,750
Said to be a farmer from
the glorious land of Punjab, India..

1504
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:08,833
He's being addressed as the noble Sikh.

1505
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:10,250
Sardaarji.

1506
01:34:10,958 --> 01:34:13,083
As a result he's a savior,
setting example..

1507
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,917
..of human compassion.

1508
01:34:16,042 --> 01:34:17,333
Sardaarji!

1509
01:34:34,375 --> 01:34:36,500
Hey, why are you so sad?

1510
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:39,500
He didn't tell me what his name was.

1511
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:41,208
Who are you talking about?

1512
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:44,000
Ice cream man.

1513
01:34:56,167 --> 01:34:58,167
Thank God you got a flat tyre.

1514
01:34:58,292 --> 01:34:59,963
Otherwise, I wouldn't find you.

1515
01:35:00,083 --> 01:35:02,583
I don't have any money to give you.

1516
01:35:02,958 --> 01:35:04,875
I have spent all the money that I had.

1517
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,167
I know.

1518
01:35:06,542 --> 01:35:08,750
From the time that
wretch has left the truck..

1519
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:11,083
..with God's grace
everything is going well.

1520
01:35:12,333 --> 01:35:14,042
I too didn't like her.

1521
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:16,042
Did you look at the clothes she wears?

1522
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:18,667
Her shoes don't match with the belt.

1523
01:35:18,792 --> 01:35:20,922
The earrings don't match the top.

1524
01:35:21,042 --> 01:35:23,917
Moreover, her nail paint
doesn't match with anything.

1525
01:35:24,083 --> 01:35:27,208
I didn't tell her anything
on her face but I felt it from within.

1526
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:29,417
Thank God my marriage
didn't take place otherwise..

1527
01:35:29,667 --> 01:35:31,917
..I would have felt
guilty all my life..

1528
01:35:32,042 --> 01:35:34,042
..that I had such strange
people attending my wedding.

1529
01:35:34,167 --> 01:35:36,000
Now which radio frequency is she on?

1530
01:35:36,667 --> 01:35:38,792
You have matched your clothes so well.

1531
01:35:38,917 --> 01:35:40,000
Your shirt matches with your turban.

1532
01:35:40,125 --> 01:35:42,750
People say that boys
no dressing sense.

1533
01:35:42,917 --> 01:35:43,917
Rubbish.

1534
01:35:44,417 --> 01:35:47,458
Girls have to be smart.

1535
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:50,042
Specially,
when it comes to matching things.

1536
01:36:15,458 --> 01:36:16,792
Hello, Jaggi Ice Cream.

1537
01:36:16,917 --> 01:36:19,833
Ice Cream man,
I am the bridegroom speaking.

1538
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:22,208
Brother, I have stopped
selling ice creams.

1539
01:36:22,708 --> 01:36:25,208
I know that when they run
out of ice cream at a wedding..

1540
01:36:25,333 --> 01:36:28,375
..people tend to go
and complain to the groom.

1541
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:31,917
But I am sorry to say that I no longer
give home delivery of ice creams.

1542
01:36:32,042 --> 01:36:36,000
I don't want ice cream,
I want Diljyot.

1543
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:39,000
Soni is with me.

1544
01:36:39,667 --> 01:36:41,083
I will kill Soni.

1545
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:42,917
Brother Rajveer?

1546
01:36:43,042 --> 01:36:44,125
Kill her!

1547
01:36:44,333 --> 01:36:45,625
You have my complete support.

1548
01:36:45,875 --> 01:36:47,917
I didn't interrupt your wedding.

1549
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:49,667
If she had stayed with me..

1550
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:52,167
..then I would've sprinkled
pesticides on her and killed her.

1551
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:53,292
Have you lost your mind?

1552
01:36:53,458 --> 01:36:55,042
Do you think that I am lying?

1553
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:56,708
Here, talk to her.

1554
01:36:57,583 --> 01:36:58,917
Listen to me.

1555
01:36:59,125 --> 01:37:04,042
If you come here then I will kill you.

1556
01:37:07,125 --> 01:37:08,292
Did you hear that?

1557
01:37:09,167 --> 01:37:10,542
Half an hour.

1558
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:12,375
- Ghost Town.
- Who is it?

1559
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:21,250
What happened?

1560
01:37:23,917 --> 01:37:25,042
He says that he will shoot her.

1561
01:37:25,875 --> 01:37:26,625
Don't turn around.

1562
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:28,125
Your destination lies ahead.

1563
01:37:29,708 --> 01:37:32,125
Don't turn around.
Your destination lies ahead.

1564
01:37:34,958 --> 01:37:35,750
Get lost then!

1565
01:37:53,333 --> 01:37:55,958
Look, there comes the entire family.

1566
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:04,042
You kidnapped my
bride from our wedding..

1567
01:38:04,208 --> 01:38:06,292
You can try your best.

1568
01:38:07,708 --> 01:38:10,208
Now I will get married to Diljyot.

1569
01:38:11,292 --> 01:38:14,667
And I will bury both
of you right here.

1570
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,458
- Speak no evil..
- I know.

1571
01:38:19,583 --> 01:38:20,417
" Speak no evil.."

1572
01:38:20,625 --> 01:38:21,875
First look,
how many people are over there.

1573
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,917
They have guns in their hands.

1574
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:25,667
They will first thrash
us black and blue..

1575
01:38:25,792 --> 01:38:27,000
..then kill and bury us here itself.

1576
01:38:28,042 --> 01:38:29,667
Go and rest in the
trunk and send Athra.

1577
01:38:29,958 --> 01:38:30,792
Go away.

1578
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:34,042
Artha, come here.

1579
01:38:35,625 --> 01:38:36,458
Come on, pal.

1580
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:38,963
Has he lost it?

1581
01:38:39,083 --> 01:38:39,958
Artha, Bro?

1582
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:44,708
This journey is very tiring, man.

1583
01:38:44,958 --> 01:38:46,792
I don't feel like getting up.

1584
01:38:46,917 --> 01:38:48,125
Come on, it's war now.

1585
01:38:48,333 --> 01:38:50,250
I am enjoying my retirement.

1586
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:53,125
You have the white one with you.
Take him along.

1587
01:38:53,542 --> 01:38:54,792
Come here.

1588
01:38:55,208 --> 01:38:56,500
No, please don't do that.

1589
01:38:56,625 --> 01:38:58,958
They are very strong.
They won't be hesitant..

1590
01:38:59,083 --> 01:39:00,042
I won't be able to
do thing things at a time.

1591
01:39:00,167 --> 01:39:02,125
I can't get beaten up and
stand with my hands folded like him.

1592
01:39:04,958 --> 01:39:08,208
Fine, I promise that we will
beat up Gill the mini bus owner..

1593
01:39:08,333 --> 01:39:10,083
..when we go back to our village.

1594
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:12,333
No.

1595
01:39:13,208 --> 01:39:15,750
Okay, we will hit people
from Khurd at Gugge Marhi's fair.

1596
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:18,750
Don't get angry, Brother Jaggi.

1597
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,917
Go and tell that to Dil's husband.

1598
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:23,542
Jaggi, shall I go and talk to him?

1599
01:39:23,917 --> 01:39:25,250
I think that is a good idea.

1600
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,625
Because this issue
is between the two of you.

1601
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:28,250
I got trapped unnecessarily.
I am already quite late.

1602
01:39:28,375 --> 01:39:29,000
You go and talk to him.

1603
01:39:29,125 --> 01:39:30,667
Bloody ice cream man!

1604
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:36,208
You ice creaming selling Sardaar!

1605
01:39:38,417 --> 01:39:40,792
What he said was wrong.

1606
01:39:40,917 --> 01:39:41,917
Come here.

1607
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:44,833
Mr. Athra, you take care of him.

1608
01:39:45,333 --> 01:39:49,167
If there's a will, there's a way.

1609
01:39:49,542 --> 01:39:50,542
Come here!

1610
01:39:55,125 --> 01:39:56,000
Go!

1611
01:40:00,333 --> 01:40:04,042
Whether a Sardaar is an
Army Brigadier or a Gatekeeper.

1612
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:09,000
Whether a Sardaar is Canada's
Mayor or a Council Member.

1613
01:40:09,667 --> 01:40:13,958
Whether he owns all the land
from Kabul to Kanjra or farm on rent.

1614
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,042
Whether a Sardaar
is a Prime Minister..

1615
01:40:27,833 --> 01:40:29,417
Or an Ice Cream Man..

1616
01:40:33,708 --> 01:40:35,667
You should always included
"Ji" while addressing a Sardaar.

1617
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,500
You should always included
"Ji" while addressing a Sardaar.

1618
01:41:12,083 --> 01:41:15,875
Let's go,
Sister, we have had enough of drama.

1619
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:24,417
Why are you looking at me?

1620
01:41:24,542 --> 01:41:26,792
I don't care even if he bleeds out.

1621
01:41:27,375 --> 01:41:29,500
Then what should I do?

1622
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:31,458
My dress is brand new.

1623
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:34,042
I didn't buy a hankie because of you.

1624
01:41:35,833 --> 01:41:37,042
Damn you, Khuwala.

1625
01:41:37,917 --> 01:41:39,583
You were fighting for them?

1626
01:41:40,208 --> 01:41:41,750
Hey look, Noble Sikh!

1627
01:41:41,875 --> 01:41:43,667
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God!

1628
01:41:43,917 --> 01:41:44,792
He's the Noble Sikh!

1629
01:41:44,917 --> 01:41:45,667
No I'm not.

1630
01:41:45,792 --> 01:41:47,125
- My God, you are bleeding.
- Are you hurt?

1631
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:48,917
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

1632
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:50,708
I'll fix it.

1633
01:41:50,917 --> 01:41:53,542
Can I take a selfie with you? Please?

1634
01:41:54,125 --> 01:41:55,417
Can I see the ice cream truck?

1635
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:56,917
- Ice cream?
- Yeah, yeah.

1636
01:41:57,042 --> 01:41:59,250
- Okay.
- Yes, I will help you walk.

1637
01:41:59,542 --> 01:42:00,208
Athra was here.

1638
01:42:00,333 --> 01:42:02,208
I feel like asking him
to hit both of you as well.

1639
01:42:03,292 --> 01:42:04,333
Take a rickshaw home.

1640
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:06,542
Yeah!

1641
01:42:06,667 --> 01:42:07,625
Hey, say cheese!

1642
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:11,958
Don't wait until its dark.

1643
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,208
- Bye!
- Bye!

1644
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:15,792
Go home on time.

1645
01:42:15,917 --> 01:42:17,208
Leave them alone.

1646
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,458
" I have lost peace of my mind."

1647
01:42:32,583 --> 01:42:35,708
" I keep kissing your
silky handkerchief."

1648
01:42:35,833 --> 01:42:38,333
" I have lost peace of my mind."

1649
01:42:38,458 --> 01:42:41,167
" I keep kissing your
silky handkerchief."

1650
01:42:41,292 --> 01:42:44,542
" Like a 100 watt bulb,
the fire oh so frisky."

1651
01:42:44,667 --> 01:42:47,083
" Because of you,
everything becomes risky."

1652
01:42:47,208 --> 01:42:50,750
" They keep devising plans
to be with you, missy."

1653
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,292
" I have lost peace of my mind."

1654
01:42:54,583 --> 01:42:57,708
" I keep kissing your
silky handkerchief."

1655
01:42:57,833 --> 01:43:00,208
" I have lost peace of my mind."

1656
01:43:00,333 --> 01:43:04,042
" I keep kissing your
silky handkerchief."

1657
01:43:21,208 --> 01:43:26,583
" The dynamitic kohl in
your eyes enhances your youth."

1658
01:43:26,792 --> 01:43:32,875
" You have made your hair soft
and silky by using deep conditioners."

1659
01:43:33,125 --> 01:43:35,333
" By using deep conditioners."

1660
01:43:35,542 --> 01:43:38,167
" Our conversations
have become golden."

1661
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:41,583
" Just like the corn when ripens."

1662
01:43:41,708 --> 01:43:44,042
" I have lost peace of my mind."

1663
01:43:44,292 --> 01:43:47,458
" I keep kissing your
silky handkerchief."

1664
01:43:58,917 --> 01:44:04,625
" I will gather some courage
and confess my feelings to you."

1665
01:44:04,792 --> 01:44:10,792
" I won't let your fans trouble you,
I will set them aside."

1666
01:44:10,917 --> 01:44:13,417
" I will set them aside."

1667
01:44:13,542 --> 01:44:16,250
" I won't let your lovers survive."

1668
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:19,625
" I am ready to fight."

1669
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:22,125
" I have lost peace of my mind."

1670
01:44:22,292 --> 01:44:25,500
" I keep kissing your
silky handkerchief."

1671
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:27,963
" I have lost peace of my mind."

1672
01:44:28,083 --> 01:44:31,708
" I keep kissing your
silky handkerchief."

1673
01:44:36,375 --> 01:44:38,125
Your destination
is still 50 kilometers..

1674
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:40,167
..that is one hour away from here.

1675
01:44:40,458 --> 01:44:41,922
Even after all this commotion..

1676
01:44:42,042 --> 01:44:43,880
..your destination
is still 50 kilometers..

1677
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,500
..that is one hour away from here.

1678
01:44:47,833 --> 01:44:49,583
I should beat these wretches.

1679
01:44:49,875 --> 01:44:52,333
Because of them madam has
said one hour for the third time.

1680
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:54,583
Forget them, Madam. They are idiots.

1681
01:44:54,708 --> 01:44:56,083
They don't value hard work.

1682
01:44:57,583 --> 01:45:00,167
Now no matter who stands in the way,
I won't stop the truck.

1683
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,083
Soldier!

1684
01:45:07,792 --> 01:45:10,000
Jaggi, can you see me?

1685
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:12,458
Yes, I can.
I can see everything.

1686
01:45:12,583 --> 01:45:13,792
How is Roop?

1687
01:45:13,917 --> 01:45:14,583
Here.

1688
01:45:14,792 --> 01:45:16,708
Wait. Talk to him.

1689
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,792
Wonderful, multicolor hair extensions.

1690
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,417
Colorful anklets!

1691
01:45:21,542 --> 01:45:23,333
Isn't she looking beautiful, Jaggi?

1692
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:26,042
Oh God, she is looking so cute!

1693
01:45:26,167 --> 01:45:27,292
You have pleased me!

1694
01:45:27,417 --> 01:45:28,708
This time when I
come back to village..

1695
01:45:28,833 --> 01:45:30,208
..I will buy you a toy gun, I promise.

1696
01:45:30,708 --> 01:45:34,375
Look how hard my friend
is working for our village.

1697
01:45:34,708 --> 01:45:36,167
We can see that.

1698
01:45:36,333 --> 01:45:38,333
Double hard work.

1699
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,542
They are just passengers.
They asked me for a lift.

1700
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:44,875
Their destination has passed
by but they aren't ready to get down.

1701
01:45:45,042 --> 01:45:45,922
There's more.

1702
01:45:46,042 --> 01:45:47,833
They are stubborn.
They aren't getting off.

1703
01:45:49,958 --> 01:45:51,083
Wait! Wait! Wait!

1704
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:56,792
Get up!

1705
01:45:57,292 --> 01:45:59,250
They are sleeping as if
they are partners in this truck.

1706
01:45:59,375 --> 01:46:01,583
Get down and push the truck,
Lady Gaga.

1707
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:03,880
- Yes, we are going.
- She says what happened?

1708
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,042
- Get down Madam.
- This won't end anything.

1709
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:09,625
Look, there it ends.

1710
01:46:10,167 --> 01:46:11,458
Push it.

1711
01:46:11,583 --> 01:46:12,625
Push harder.

1712
01:46:17,208 --> 01:46:19,000
I think I will have to go and push it.

1713
01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:22,125
Don't you know how to push?

1714
01:46:25,625 --> 01:46:28,042
You should have told
me that you have guests.

1715
01:46:28,750 --> 01:46:30,125
Good that they are here.

1716
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:31,833
Now we don't have to
worry about pushing the truck.

1717
01:46:32,042 --> 01:46:33,500
Come on, girls,
let's go and sit in the truck.

1718
01:46:33,625 --> 01:46:35,250
- Uncle and his gang will push it.
- Okay?

1719
01:46:35,375 --> 01:46:37,583
What are you talking about, handsome?

1720
01:46:37,708 --> 01:46:40,000
I have come here to push you.

1721
01:46:40,292 --> 01:46:41,125
To push to hell.

1722
01:46:41,333 --> 01:46:44,250
It's okay.
One tends to get grumpy in old age.

1723
01:46:44,458 --> 01:46:45,875
I won't give you any trouble, Uncle.

1724
01:46:46,042 --> 01:46:47,667
Do one thing, all of you sit inside.

1725
01:46:47,792 --> 01:46:48,917
Come on girls, let's push it.

1726
01:46:49,083 --> 01:46:50,292
No, no, no.

1727
01:46:51,042 --> 01:46:53,250
This time none of your
smart talks will work.

1728
01:46:54,375 --> 01:46:57,875
This time my gun will do the talking.

1729
01:46:58,208 --> 01:46:59,708
The gun will talk?

1730
01:47:00,583 --> 01:47:02,667
Brother with kohl in his eyes,
don't mind it.

1731
01:47:02,875 --> 01:47:05,250
Whether you agree with me or not,
but you do look familiar.

1732
01:47:06,583 --> 01:47:08,167
What nonsense!

1733
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:10,000
You always say that when we meet.

1734
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:11,458
" You look familiar."

1735
01:47:11,583 --> 01:47:13,917
What's so amusing about
me that I look so familiar?

1736
01:47:14,042 --> 01:47:17,125
If you say that again then
I will shoot you with my empty gun.

1737
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:22,417
What? Can't I get a call?

1738
01:47:22,833 --> 01:47:24,458
I am a successful farmer from Punjab.

1739
01:47:24,583 --> 01:47:26,500
I don't just carry gun around.

1740
01:47:26,625 --> 01:47:27,750
Tell them, Uncle.

1741
01:47:27,917 --> 01:47:30,042
Let him answer it.

1742
01:47:30,333 --> 01:47:32,750
After this, his friends will
be carrying him on their shoulder.

1743
01:47:33,708 --> 01:47:34,125
Hello?

1744
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:37,542
Jaggi, it's me, your Aunt Nagma.

1745
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:40,167
You have become famous in Australia.

1746
01:47:40,292 --> 01:47:42,750
They are talking about
you in every channel.

1747
01:47:42,875 --> 01:47:44,875
You got the title
of Noble Sikh, right?

1748
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:48,583
Son, from where did
you get so many dollars?

1749
01:47:48,792 --> 01:47:50,042
Auntie, I will come home and tell you.

1750
01:47:50,292 --> 01:47:52,042
I am not asking you.

1751
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:56,500
A few suited men with
dark glasses have come here.

1752
01:47:56,625 --> 01:47:57,875
They are questioning me.

1753
01:47:58,125 --> 01:47:59,375
Who are they?

1754
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:01,125
They are troubling me.

1755
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,208
I have done the pest control.

1756
01:48:02,333 --> 01:48:04,125
There are no mosquitoes
or cockroaches at home.

1757
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:07,625
And yet,
they keep looking under the sofa.

1758
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:08,083
Don't worry, Auntie.

1759
01:48:08,208 --> 01:48:09,458
I will tell you everything
once I come to leave the truck.

1760
01:48:09,583 --> 01:48:11,625
I am hanging up now.
I am somewhat busy with something.

1761
01:48:11,792 --> 01:48:12,542
Bye.

1762
01:48:14,875 --> 01:48:16,333
Aunt Nagma too is just..

1763
01:48:29,875 --> 01:48:30,750
Hey!

1764
01:48:34,542 --> 01:48:35,875
Look at me!

1765
01:48:36,917 --> 01:48:39,500
You are Aunt Nagma's son, right?

1766
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:40,875
Who is Aunt Nagma?

1767
01:48:41,333 --> 01:48:42,333
The owner of this truck!

1768
01:48:43,042 --> 01:48:44,583
You kohl eyed,
why aren't you saying anything!

1769
01:48:49,167 --> 01:48:51,333
What is he saying?

1770
01:48:52,625 --> 01:48:54,083
This truck belongs to you?

1771
01:49:00,292 --> 01:49:04,417
Okay, this truck
belongs to Aunt Nagma.

1772
01:49:04,542 --> 01:49:06,125
And he was driving.

1773
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:09,792
You hid this fact from me.

1774
01:49:11,542 --> 01:49:19,708
Either you or Aunt Nagma
knows where its keys are kept.

1775
01:49:26,958 --> 01:49:31,542
The truck visible on CCTV camera
was driven by you and not Jaggi.

1776
01:49:31,667 --> 01:49:35,042
And the person who got down
from the truck was you and not Jaggi.

1777
01:49:35,958 --> 01:49:36,792
You.

1778
01:49:37,792 --> 01:49:40,917
Tell me the truth,
where are the dollars!

1779
01:49:41,208 --> 01:49:44,292
Don't ask, Uncle.
It will make you cry.

1780
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:45,500
Oh no.

1781
01:49:45,792 --> 01:49:48,000
Let me kill him and
end his story, Uncle.

1782
01:49:48,667 --> 01:49:52,083
Why waste a bullet on
him he is a useless beast.

1783
01:49:52,208 --> 01:49:53,750
No Uncle, let me kill him.

1784
01:49:53,875 --> 01:49:56,042
You won't be able to shoot, Brother.

1785
01:49:56,167 --> 01:49:58,000
Because we don't have any bullets.

1786
01:50:02,958 --> 01:50:04,792
I will break everyone's heads now!

1787
01:50:06,083 --> 01:50:07,875
You have got me scared for so long.

1788
01:50:08,292 --> 01:50:09,875
Couldn't you tell me that
you don't have any bullets?

1789
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:13,917
Tell me the truth,
where are the dollars?

1790
01:50:14,417 --> 01:50:16,542
Uncle, I had kept them
in the garage at home.

1791
01:50:23,708 --> 01:50:26,833
I think my mother kept
them in the truck by mistake.

1792
01:50:27,208 --> 01:50:28,917
You tell us, where are the dollars!

1793
01:50:33,208 --> 01:50:34,542
I gave them to kids.

1794
01:50:35,917 --> 01:50:36,917
Amazing!

1795
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:40,625
Well done.
You are incomparable, oh generous one.

1796
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:42,542
Have you lost your mind?

1797
01:50:42,667 --> 01:50:44,375
You give all the money to kids!

1798
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:46,000
You have ruined us.

1799
01:50:49,875 --> 01:50:53,167
You win some and you lose some.

1800
01:50:54,375 --> 01:50:56,333
This is the struggle of life.

1801
01:50:57,625 --> 01:51:00,458
Now I cannot go back
to my country empty-handed.

1802
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:07,333
Don't worry, Uncle.

1803
01:51:07,542 --> 01:51:09,417
You will get to see Peshawar
and you will also go home.

1804
01:51:09,667 --> 01:51:10,792
How will I face them?

1805
01:51:10,917 --> 01:51:12,292
You will show this very face.

1806
01:51:12,417 --> 01:51:15,458
When you have the dollars,
this very face will look handsome.

1807
01:51:17,042 --> 01:51:18,875
I am getting 5 lakh dollars.

1808
01:51:19,167 --> 01:51:20,458
You can take some of it.

1809
01:51:24,208 --> 01:51:25,500
Follow me.

1810
01:51:26,958 --> 01:51:27,875
Get up.

1811
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,208
You were so charged up before.

1812
01:51:29,333 --> 01:51:30,542
And now you are not even moving.

1813
01:51:32,167 --> 01:51:33,792
Now do you two need
separate invitations?

1814
01:51:34,042 --> 01:51:35,500
Come, Lady Gaga.

1815
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:36,958
Get in.

1816
01:51:41,583 --> 01:51:43,000
Why do you look sad now?

1817
01:51:44,583 --> 01:51:47,542
Noble men are God's men.

1818
01:51:48,042 --> 01:51:49,333
Drive the car.

1819
01:51:51,583 --> 01:51:52,750
Jaggi..

1820
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:56,880
Jaggi, from where are
you getting 5 lakh dollars?

1821
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,333
Why are you asking him?

1822
01:51:58,542 --> 01:52:00,208
Don't ask. It will cause bad luck.

1823
01:52:00,667 --> 01:52:03,750
Your destination is
just five kilometers away.

1824
01:52:07,917 --> 01:52:09,000
Amazing!

1825
01:52:09,208 --> 01:52:10,922
Now listen as to how
am I getting 5 lakh dollars.

1826
01:52:11,042 --> 01:52:11,917
Tell us.

1827
01:52:17,208 --> 01:52:18,000
Hello?

1828
01:52:18,375 --> 01:52:19,875
Can I talk to Jaggi?

1829
01:52:20,125 --> 01:52:22,042
Uncle, you should look
at the time before you call.

1830
01:52:22,167 --> 01:52:23,458
Some people also have to sleep.

1831
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,250
Hang up, Shiny.
Don't make me beat you up.

1832
01:52:27,333 --> 01:52:28,917
Yes Brother,
whom do you wish to talk to?

1833
01:52:29,083 --> 01:52:31,625
Jaggi, it's me,
Vicky from the organic farm.

1834
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:33,000
Listen up.

1835
01:52:33,333 --> 01:52:36,333
The plants you used your
homemade manure on..

1836
01:52:37,083 --> 01:52:39,667
..those plants gave
three times more fruits.

1837
01:52:39,917 --> 01:52:42,167
And I made a profit of 5 lakh dollars.

1838
01:52:42,417 --> 01:52:45,333
Your manure is now popular
all across Australia.

1839
01:52:45,625 --> 01:52:48,792
One hundred farmers of Longford
used this manure..

1840
01:52:48,917 --> 01:52:50,542
..and earned three times more profit.

1841
01:52:50,667 --> 01:52:53,250
You are the one who rightly
deserves this money, Brother.

1842
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:54,833
I deserve it?

1843
01:52:55,583 --> 01:52:57,167
They liked my manure?

1844
01:52:57,292 --> 01:53:00,250
Brother Vicky, will these
5 lakh dollars be anywhere..

1845
01:53:00,625 --> 01:53:02,458
..close to 1.5 crores Indian rupees?

1846
01:53:02,958 --> 01:53:05,042
Yes, it's more than that.

1847
01:53:05,208 --> 01:53:06,708
Forget about that.

1848
01:53:06,958 --> 01:53:08,000
You note down the address.

1849
01:53:08,125 --> 01:53:09,667
Yes, I will note it down right away.

1850
01:53:11,042 --> 01:53:13,958
C-496 Longford.

1851
01:53:14,167 --> 01:53:15,333
Longford.

1852
01:53:15,542 --> 01:53:16,963
I have kept a big get-together.

1853
01:53:17,083 --> 01:53:18,500
Please be there, brother.

1854
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:20,333
Okay, Brother.
I will be there on time.

1855
01:53:20,458 --> 01:53:21,500
Okay, bye.

1856
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:23,000
Yes, Brother. Bye.

1857
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:33,208
Your destination is just
100 meters away, on the right side.

1858
01:53:33,792 --> 01:53:35,542
Oh my God!

1859
01:53:39,792 --> 01:53:40,667
It's Babbu!

1860
01:53:42,208 --> 01:53:43,167
Hello, Babbu!

1861
01:53:44,083 --> 01:53:46,792
Babbu! I have reached!

1862
01:53:55,333 --> 01:53:57,542
You have reached your destination.

1863
01:53:57,667 --> 01:53:58,750
Congratulations.

1864
01:53:59,333 --> 01:54:01,458
You have reached your destination.

1865
01:54:01,583 --> 01:54:02,958
Congratulations.

1866
01:54:03,542 --> 01:54:05,542
You have reached your destination.

1867
01:54:05,875 --> 01:54:07,042
Congratulations.

1868
01:54:12,583 --> 01:54:15,958
Soni, there is nothing here.

1869
01:54:18,667 --> 01:54:21,375
Uncle, I think someone
played a joke on Jaggi.

1870
01:54:53,458 --> 01:54:55,333
Brother Jaggi, it's Babbu!
Phone got disconnected.

1871
01:54:55,458 --> 01:54:56,963
Did you pack your bags?

1872
01:54:57,083 --> 01:54:58,375
Come soon, Brother.

1873
01:54:58,792 --> 01:55:01,000
People from Kalan think
that the land now belongs to them.

1874
01:55:01,125 --> 01:55:03,708
But I have made all the
arrangements to teach them a lesson.

1875
01:55:03,833 --> 01:55:04,542
Ask me how!

1876
01:55:04,667 --> 01:55:05,708
Babbu..

1877
01:55:05,875 --> 01:55:07,083
It's me, Bhola, Brother.

1878
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:09,917
I asked put colorful flags
from the big river to our village.

1879
01:55:10,125 --> 01:55:11,542
I couldn't arrange for the money.

1880
01:55:11,708 --> 01:55:13,208
I have also booked a Bhangra Group.

1881
01:55:13,333 --> 01:55:14,833
We will lose the land, Babbu.

1882
01:55:16,625 --> 01:55:18,125
I couldn't arrange for the money.

1883
01:55:18,250 --> 01:55:20,333
I have invited the whole village.

1884
01:55:20,792 --> 01:55:21,750
I am not left with anything.

1885
01:55:21,875 --> 01:55:23,042
What did you say? Dance?

1886
01:55:23,167 --> 01:55:27,042
Everyone has sore muscles
because of dance a lot.

1887
01:55:27,167 --> 01:55:28,708
How will I come back to my village?

1888
01:55:29,042 --> 01:55:31,708
We will throw the
money on their faces.

1889
01:55:31,833 --> 01:55:33,375
I will talk to you later.

1890
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:34,625
Come back soon, brother.

1891
01:55:34,750 --> 01:55:36,750
Yes, come back soon.

1892
01:55:37,542 --> 01:55:39,542
Hurry up back, Jaggi.

1893
01:55:42,417 --> 01:55:44,042
Don't lose hope, son.

1894
01:55:44,750 --> 01:55:47,167
God willing, everything will be fine.

1895
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:51,417
You fool, you don't even know
that you have changed the way I think.

1896
01:55:52,708 --> 01:55:53,875
Your Uncle Pathan..

1897
01:55:56,125 --> 01:55:58,500
..is going back to his country!
His beautiful Pakistan.

1898
01:55:58,750 --> 01:56:01,167
If I stay alive,
then we shall meet you.

1899
01:56:02,958 --> 01:56:04,000
Good bye.

1900
01:56:09,083 --> 01:56:11,375
Let's go back to
our beautiful Pakistan.

1901
01:56:23,667 --> 01:56:24,542
Jaggi!

1902
01:56:28,667 --> 01:56:31,208
Now whatever we do,
we will do it together.

1903
01:56:32,125 --> 01:56:33,125
Yes, Jaggi.

1904
01:56:50,583 --> 01:56:53,083
If he had a spare key in the truck..

1905
01:56:53,208 --> 01:56:55,708
..then why did he come
to the wedding with me?

1906
01:56:56,458 --> 01:56:58,000
He didn't come from me.

1907
01:56:59,125 --> 01:57:00,583
He must have come for you.

1908
01:57:04,792 --> 01:57:06,500
Is that your final order, sir?

1909
01:57:08,917 --> 01:57:10,000
Would you like anything else, mate?

1910
01:57:10,125 --> 01:57:11,667
Get me some phenol.

1911
01:57:12,375 --> 01:57:13,417
Okay.

1912
01:57:16,250 --> 01:57:19,000
Girls, are you going
to the millionaire's party?

1913
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:20,792
No, Ma'am.

1914
01:57:20,917 --> 01:57:22,417
We just need a lift to the bus stand.

1915
01:57:22,542 --> 01:57:24,583
You know he is the
richest farmer around.

1916
01:57:25,083 --> 01:57:26,250
And you know why?

1917
01:57:26,375 --> 01:57:32,167
Because every farmer around here has
used his homemade manure for produce.

1918
01:57:32,458 --> 01:57:34,333
Farmers here have made a big profit.

1919
01:57:34,583 --> 01:57:37,042
They want to share
their profits with him.

1920
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,667
This is my contribution.

1921
01:57:39,792 --> 01:57:41,958
Roger, this is our contribution.

1922
01:57:43,167 --> 01:57:44,042
What..

1923
01:57:49,208 --> 01:57:51,125
Are you thinking what I am thinking?

1924
01:57:53,208 --> 01:57:54,922
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1925
01:57:55,042 --> 01:57:57,708
That's Jaggi's truck.

1926
01:57:57,833 --> 01:57:59,542
There will be a lot of money in that
party. Jaggi's problem will get solved.

1927
01:57:59,667 --> 01:58:00,458
Let's go to the party with his truck.

1928
01:58:00,583 --> 01:58:02,417
He will surely follow us.

1929
01:58:02,542 --> 01:58:03,250
- He's unpredictable. But we can try.
- Get in! Get in!

1930
01:58:04,458 --> 01:58:06,458
See you later!

1931
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:11,667
- Hey!
- Let's go.

1932
01:58:23,875 --> 01:58:24,833
Police!

1933
01:58:25,333 --> 01:58:27,708
You have the right to remain silent.

1934
01:58:27,917 --> 01:58:30,250
Keep your hands where I can see them.

1935
01:58:30,583 --> 01:58:32,542
We don't have the authority to shoot.

1936
01:58:32,833 --> 01:58:34,917
But there just might be an accident.

1937
01:58:35,833 --> 01:58:39,667
Now, I'll read out the laws
of this great country of Australia.

1938
01:58:46,833 --> 01:58:48,125
Hey, don't get up.

1939
01:58:50,417 --> 01:58:51,458
Don't look around.

1940
01:58:52,875 --> 01:58:54,167
Hey, start the car.

1941
01:58:54,583 --> 01:58:57,750
Don't shoot. Come on.

1942
01:58:58,042 --> 01:58:59,333
He's getting away.

1943
01:59:05,917 --> 01:59:06,875
Hello.

1944
01:59:08,875 --> 01:59:11,125
- Our contribution.
- Thank you so much.

1945
01:59:15,125 --> 01:59:16,167
Thank you.

1946
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:20,500
Okay, this is the case.

1947
01:59:21,042 --> 01:59:22,833
This is what the program is.

1948
01:59:22,958 --> 01:59:24,667
They are keeping the money in a bag.

1949
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,250
Look up there.

1950
01:59:49,083 --> 01:59:52,042
And John, make sure
to keep the bag safe.

1951
01:59:52,208 --> 01:59:53,792
- Okay?
- Yes, Ma'am.

1952
01:59:54,875 --> 01:59:57,458
John, make sure
to keep the bag safe.

1953
02:00:05,458 --> 02:00:06,667
Hurry up!

1954
02:00:07,417 --> 02:00:08,792
I can't open it.

1955
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,750
You find a bag to keep the money in.

1956
02:00:13,417 --> 02:00:14,875
Empty it.

1957
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:17,417
Hurry up.

1958
02:00:19,875 --> 02:00:21,750
Here. I will remove the money,
you put them in the bag.

1959
02:00:22,333 --> 02:00:23,042
Hurry up.

1960
02:00:30,792 --> 02:00:31,958
What are they doing upstairs?

1961
02:00:40,625 --> 02:00:42,167
Tea, anyone?

1962
02:00:44,333 --> 02:00:45,292
Tea, anyone?

1963
02:00:45,708 --> 02:00:46,625
Hello.

1964
02:00:49,042 --> 02:00:50,000
Hello.

1965
02:00:53,542 --> 02:00:55,250
- Hi handsome.
- Tea?

1966
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:59,042
Wait, someone is coming.

1967
02:01:04,417 --> 02:01:06,000
What are you two
doing here..stealing?

1968
02:01:06,167 --> 02:01:07,042
No.

1969
02:01:13,125 --> 02:01:14,750
My truck is parked outside.

1970
02:01:15,042 --> 02:01:17,042
If you steal here,
then I will be blamed for it.

1971
02:01:17,208 --> 02:01:18,917
Keep the money you stole back.

1972
02:01:19,125 --> 02:01:20,208
Where is the money?

1973
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:22,750
She has already lost her mind.

1974
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:24,250
She is crazy.

1975
02:01:24,375 --> 02:01:25,875
You are educated, right?
You are a smart girl.

1976
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,167
- You have done a crockery course too, right?
- Yes.

1977
02:01:28,292 --> 02:01:31,292
Keep the money back and
both of you come with me.

1978
02:01:32,125 --> 02:01:33,792
Don't pressurize me..

1979
02:01:34,042 --> 02:01:36,167
Otherwise, I will tell you
where I have kept the dollars.

1980
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:44,917
What are you doing Jaggi.

1981
02:01:45,250 --> 02:01:46,083
Soni, let go of the money!

1982
02:01:46,208 --> 02:01:47,208
This is their money.
This is not our money.

1983
02:01:47,333 --> 02:01:48,542
Let go of the bag, Jaggi.

1984
02:01:48,708 --> 02:01:50,625
I have to go to Punjab, not you!

1985
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:52,750
- Let go!
- You two have come here to cause trouble.

1986
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,000
- Don't do this.
- You are always cribbing. Move aside!

1987
02:01:56,667 --> 02:01:59,625
Dollars are with me, over here.
Let go of it.

1988
02:02:08,333 --> 02:02:10,750
- Oh!
- Where did he come from?

1989
02:02:10,958 --> 02:02:13,042
- Oh my God!, Is he dead?
- What is going on?

1990
02:02:19,083 --> 02:02:20,333
How are you, Jaggi?

1991
02:02:23,375 --> 02:02:24,917
From where did you crash-landed?

1992
02:02:25,792 --> 02:02:26,708
Brother Vicky?

1993
02:02:26,917 --> 02:02:28,875
Everyone has been waiting for you.

1994
02:02:29,208 --> 02:02:33,083
The address that you gave
me there was nothing over there.

1995
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:35,333
I had lost all hope.

1996
02:02:36,333 --> 02:02:40,083
I thought that you took
revenge from me for insulting you.

1997
02:02:42,625 --> 02:02:44,375
No, it's not so.

1998
02:02:44,625 --> 02:02:46,375
And I gave you the right address.

1999
02:02:54,292 --> 02:02:56,417
486..

2000
02:02:56,833 --> 02:02:58,000
Longford.

2001
02:03:00,167 --> 02:03:00,958
It's okay, come on.

2002
02:03:01,958 --> 02:03:03,042
Come on, Bro.

2003
02:03:03,833 --> 02:03:04,667
Come.

2004
02:03:09,042 --> 02:03:10,250
Come here.

2005
02:03:10,833 --> 02:03:12,208
Why are you feeling shy?

2006
02:03:12,458 --> 02:03:13,167
Come here.

2007
02:03:14,375 --> 02:03:17,000
Ladies and gentleman,
may I have your attention please?

2008
02:03:17,333 --> 02:03:18,458
Come here, Bro.

2009
02:03:18,792 --> 02:03:21,458
Let me introduce
you to the guy behind..

2010
02:03:22,417 --> 02:03:23,083
This.

2011
02:03:27,208 --> 02:03:28,083
And this.

2012
02:03:30,792 --> 02:03:34,500
The chief guest,
for whom we all have been waiting for.

2013
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:36,750
Mr. Jaggi!

2014
02:03:45,958 --> 02:03:48,958
Now I would like to request my wife,
Harpreet..

2015
02:03:49,333 --> 02:03:54,708
..to get all contributed cash,
which only belongs to Mr. Jaggi.

2016
02:04:03,875 --> 02:04:05,667
Now I would like
to request Mr. Jaggi..

2017
02:04:05,875 --> 02:04:07,958
..to share his
experiences with you guys.

2018
02:04:08,292 --> 02:04:10,417
- No, I am fine.
- Come here, don't feel shy.

2019
02:04:10,625 --> 02:04:11,500
Come here.

2020
02:04:12,250 --> 02:04:13,583
They are my friends.

2021
02:04:17,333 --> 02:04:18,083
Speak up.

2022
02:04:18,208 --> 02:04:19,708
You are their hero.

2023
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,292
Hello, Farmers.

2024
02:04:24,792 --> 02:04:25,875
Come on Jaggi.

2025
02:04:31,583 --> 02:04:35,042
Myself Jaggi Khuwala,
a successful farmer from Punjab.

2026
02:04:37,208 --> 02:04:40,208
English so-so, Punjabi outpours.

2027
02:04:40,667 --> 02:04:42,125
Means Punjabi overflows.

2028
02:04:45,083 --> 02:04:47,625
Thank you to all of
you for liking the manure.

2029
02:04:47,958 --> 02:04:49,792
You must be thinking that
Jaggi must be someone great..

2030
02:04:49,917 --> 02:04:51,458
..to invest such manure.

2031
02:04:52,458 --> 02:04:54,000
But I have nothing
to hide from all of you.

2032
02:04:54,375 --> 02:05:00,167
Actually, neither my villagers
nor anyone in Australia liked my work.

2033
02:05:01,375 --> 02:05:04,583
But I have experimented
a lot with farming back home.

2034
02:05:04,792 --> 02:05:08,083
" My village My fields"
shows Bimla madam is my fan.

2035
02:05:08,208 --> 02:05:10,250
She came to my village
and rewarded me with a trophy.

2036
02:05:10,667 --> 02:05:13,042
She said that I would
grow up to be very successful.

2037
02:05:14,083 --> 02:05:16,292
I don't know much about
the ways of the world..

2038
02:05:16,625 --> 02:05:18,208
But I know for sure that..

2039
02:05:19,292 --> 02:05:21,542
..a farmer's joy and sorrows
are linked with his field.

2040
02:05:24,375 --> 02:05:26,875
After sowing the seeds, he
thinks about going to in-laws' house.

2041
02:05:27,167 --> 02:05:30,333
When the crops grow, he attends
his sister-in-law's son first Lohri.

2042
02:05:31,042 --> 02:05:33,875
Once he sends his crops to the market,
he feels unburdened.

2043
02:05:34,542 --> 02:05:38,000
If he gets a profit, he is as happy
he would be when his son is born.

2044
02:05:39,125 --> 02:05:42,833
If his crop dries
up or gets destroyed..

2045
02:05:43,958 --> 02:05:46,042
..he feels as if
his breath has dried up.

2046
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,667
A farmer shouldn't
die if his crops die.

2047
02:05:55,458 --> 02:05:57,167
He should instead work harder.

2048
02:06:00,542 --> 02:06:02,833
Because crops can be grown again.

2049
02:06:04,833 --> 02:06:07,042
But a dead person
cannot come back to life.

2050
02:06:10,083 --> 02:06:12,708
A farmer should know
that he has another son too.

2051
02:06:22,083 --> 02:06:24,625
Like crops cannot
survive without a farmer.

2052
02:06:24,750 --> 02:06:27,000
A son too cannot survive
without his father.

2053
02:06:32,292 --> 02:06:40,000
All I want to tell everyone is to love
your harvest as well as your family.

2054
02:06:40,833 --> 02:06:42,083
Love your family.

2055
02:06:54,667 --> 02:06:55,958
I am not done..

2056
02:06:56,208 --> 02:06:58,625
I am not done yet,
and you have already started clapping.

2057
02:06:58,875 --> 02:07:01,292
Now that you have started clapping,
I think I should stop now.

2058
02:07:01,708 --> 02:07:04,083
Don't think that I don't
have anything left to talk about.

2059
02:07:04,292 --> 02:07:07,458
I have so much to say that sometimes
even Roop and Preet give up sometimes.

2060
02:07:07,708 --> 02:07:09,875
Roop and Preet are my buffaloes.

2061
02:07:12,292 --> 02:07:16,083
Due to lack of time,
all I would like to say is..

2062
02:07:16,542 --> 02:07:21,042
..if I can get the money then
I can leave for my village happily.

2063
02:07:21,917 --> 02:07:24,292
Because we have to save our land.

2064
02:07:25,083 --> 02:07:26,792
My villagers are waiting for me.

2065
02:07:30,333 --> 02:07:31,583
Come on, Jaggi!

2066
02:07:44,458 --> 02:07:46,000
Well done, Jaggi!

2067
02:07:47,167 --> 02:07:48,750
You are great.
Well done.

2068
02:08:11,958 --> 02:08:13,250
Brother, is this the money?

2069
02:08:13,750 --> 02:08:15,167
Oh yes. Thank you.

2070
02:08:19,375 --> 02:08:20,792
I feel proud..

2071
02:08:22,792 --> 02:08:24,250
To give all cash..

2072
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:25,833
To Mr.

2073
02:08:36,792 --> 02:08:38,625
Well done, Sardaarji!

2074
02:08:40,042 --> 02:08:41,208
You are great.

2075
02:08:42,625 --> 02:08:47,250
You gave 3 lakh dollars to children.

2076
02:08:47,667 --> 02:08:48,833
You were praised by everyone.

2077
02:08:48,958 --> 02:08:50,625
You became a Noble Sikh.

2078
02:08:52,875 --> 02:08:56,417
What do you think?
Will Teja just let you leave?

2079
02:08:56,833 --> 02:08:58,458
Do you think you can leave unscathed?

2080
02:09:03,583 --> 02:09:05,333
Sometimes it's a yes
and sometimes it's a no.

2081
02:09:06,583 --> 02:09:07,542
He is scared.

2082
02:09:11,292 --> 02:09:12,458
If you have any last wish..?

2083
02:09:12,708 --> 02:09:13,958
I wish to go back to my village.

2084
02:09:14,125 --> 02:09:15,333
Let me finish.

2085
02:09:16,833 --> 02:09:19,083
I was saying if you have
any last wish then forget about it.

2086
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:22,167
I am already falling short
of men and I am loaded with work.

2087
02:09:30,125 --> 02:09:32,792
If you have any last
wish then let me know, Teja.

2088
02:09:33,042 --> 02:09:38,000
Because I have a lot
of men and very less work.

2089
02:09:38,792 --> 02:09:39,833
Pathan, you?

2090
02:09:40,750 --> 02:09:42,875
You seem too eager to conclude this,
aren't you?

2091
02:09:43,042 --> 02:09:45,875
Scholars say that those who
haven't seen Lahore haven't lived.

2092
02:09:46,250 --> 02:09:47,625
And those who haven't seen Peshawar..

2093
02:09:47,958 --> 02:09:49,833
Throw your weapons down.

2094
02:09:50,708 --> 02:09:52,042
Keep them down.

2095
02:09:54,958 --> 02:09:58,042
Both of us invested to
start our taxicab business.

2096
02:09:58,708 --> 02:10:01,333
And Teja,
you ended up becoming its sole owner?

2097
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,375
Give me my share.

2098
02:10:04,083 --> 02:10:07,542
You need a lion's courage
to take your share from Teja.

2099
02:10:08,333 --> 02:10:09,583
Do you have the courage?

2100
02:10:10,875 --> 02:10:11,875
Shoot!

2101
02:10:12,917 --> 02:10:15,042
It is not necessary to
resort to guns for everything.

2102
02:10:15,333 --> 02:10:16,875
We can talk about it
and resolve it as well.

2103
02:10:17,042 --> 02:10:18,958
No, no, no.
Shoot me!

2104
02:10:19,208 --> 02:10:21,958
You don't know what
uncle Pathan can do!

2105
02:10:22,917 --> 02:10:25,458
When there will be a
bullet hole in your brain..

2106
02:10:26,042 --> 02:10:29,417
You will sit and ponder
where the water is coming from!

2107
02:10:29,708 --> 02:10:33,333
But alas, I am helpless.
I don't have any bullets.

2108
02:10:33,542 --> 02:10:34,958
That's better.

2109
02:10:40,333 --> 02:10:41,875
I am pleased to hear that.

2110
02:10:42,125 --> 02:10:45,250
Both a gun without a bullet
and a wedding without a groom..

2111
02:10:46,458 --> 02:10:47,667
Are of no use.

2112
02:10:48,125 --> 02:10:49,333
Make them stand in a line.

2113
02:10:49,458 --> 02:10:51,125
We are already standing in a line.

2114
02:10:51,625 --> 02:10:54,500
Don't talk, Jaggi. He will shoot us.

2115
02:10:55,375 --> 02:10:57,917
If he gets angry, he sprains his neck.

2116
02:11:00,042 --> 02:11:03,208
Mr. Teja, have some shame.

2117
02:11:04,458 --> 02:11:06,042
What kind of a don are you?

2118
02:11:06,250 --> 02:11:08,583
You cannot handle a worthless
man who wears sport shoes..

2119
02:11:08,833 --> 02:11:10,792
- ..and wraps a sheet around his waist?
- Move.

2120
02:11:12,250 --> 02:11:13,167
Now your turn.

2121
02:11:13,958 --> 02:11:17,500
Mr. Teja,
you have brought so many men..

2122
02:11:17,625 --> 02:11:19,667
..as if you are planning
to hijack a plane.

2123
02:11:20,042 --> 02:11:21,583
All you have to do is capture
a poor ice cream vendor!

2124
02:11:21,708 --> 02:11:23,000
Shut up!

2125
02:11:23,208 --> 02:11:24,875
I won't fooled by them!

2126
02:12:03,042 --> 02:12:06,042
If there's a will, there's a way.

2127
02:12:07,042 --> 02:12:09,000
Don't get angry, Mr. Jaggi.

2128
02:12:09,625 --> 02:12:10,750
Trust me, Brother.

2129
02:12:10,875 --> 02:12:15,125
I feel the pain of each
of the punches that hit your face.

2130
02:12:15,375 --> 02:12:16,458
Trust me.

2131
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:25,458
No..

2132
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:33,333
Tell me, in which well
should I drown myself?

2133
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:36,542
Should I punch someone
or apologize to him?

2134
02:12:36,833 --> 02:12:38,833
Hello devotional DVD, come here.

2135
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:47,667
What will it take
for you to leave the boy?

2136
02:12:47,792 --> 02:12:49,375
Which boy?

2137
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:50,625
Jaggi?

2138
02:12:52,292 --> 02:12:54,417
I direct the same question for you.

2139
02:12:54,708 --> 02:12:57,292
What will it take
for you to leave Jaggi?

2140
02:12:58,750 --> 02:13:00,333
As you can see,
this world runs on violence.

2141
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:01,875
This world is unpredictable,
Mr. Athra.

2142
02:13:02,083 --> 02:13:03,667
This world can also run on love.

2143
02:13:28,083 --> 02:13:30,250
You were right, Pathan.

2144
02:13:31,125 --> 02:13:33,125
We cannot gain anything
through violence.

2145
02:13:33,708 --> 02:13:35,042
We can sit and talk over it.

2146
02:13:35,167 --> 02:13:37,875
Start talking.
Say whatever you want to say.

2147
02:13:39,583 --> 02:13:41,042
Take this. Dollars.

2148
02:13:42,167 --> 02:13:44,375
For you to buy bullets.

2149
02:13:46,292 --> 02:13:47,125
Thank you.

2150
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:49,333
Good that you didn't see Peshawar.

2151
02:13:54,167 --> 02:13:55,542
But you have shown it to me?

2152
02:13:57,417 --> 02:13:59,625
Hey, kohl-eyed, take this.

2153
02:14:00,292 --> 02:14:04,875
Ask your mother to freeze the
dollars like she freezes ice creams.

2154
02:14:05,042 --> 02:14:07,125
Teja, I will spill your brains out!

2155
02:14:09,542 --> 02:14:12,005
Don't do that, girl! Go back home.

2156
02:14:12,125 --> 02:14:14,917
Why are you fighting, son?
You are so young.

2157
02:14:16,292 --> 02:14:17,958
Catch that damn Sardaar.

2158
02:14:22,250 --> 02:14:23,417
Sardaarji!

2159
02:14:26,042 --> 02:14:28,000
Never say anything bad.

2160
02:14:28,167 --> 02:14:29,375
You were right.

2161
02:14:29,917 --> 02:14:31,292
He is good.

2162
02:14:31,917 --> 02:14:34,042
Not good, very good.

2163
02:14:36,833 --> 02:14:38,375
Then should I die for him?

2164
02:14:39,417 --> 02:14:40,958
You don't need to die.

2165
02:14:41,667 --> 02:14:43,083
Your life is already set.

2166
02:14:45,375 --> 02:14:48,917
Jaggi and I are like the
left and the right side of the road.

2167
02:14:49,375 --> 02:14:51,000
We can never unite.

2168
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,792
So what if you two cannot unite?

2169
02:14:56,917 --> 02:14:58,333
You two can at least walk together.

2170
02:14:59,458 --> 02:15:00,333
No.

2171
02:15:00,583 --> 02:15:02,875
I know that Jaggi likes you.

2172
02:15:05,792 --> 02:15:09,917
He likes me,
but I don't know whether he loves me.

2173
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,917
You are just too much.
You always like the boy I like.

2174
02:15:15,083 --> 02:15:16,922
This time I am making a sacrifice.

2175
02:15:17,042 --> 02:15:18,208
Don't ever do this again.

2176
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:19,542
He is coming.

2177
02:15:19,875 --> 02:15:23,963
Look, the name he says first,
is the one he really loves.

2178
02:15:24,083 --> 02:15:25,292
- Okay?
- Okay.

2179
02:15:46,208 --> 02:15:48,542
Roop and Preet will be
so happy to see me, you know!

2180
02:15:50,333 --> 02:15:52,042
We won't even lose our land now.

2181
02:15:53,208 --> 02:15:54,708
I thank both of you.

2182
02:15:55,250 --> 02:15:57,125
I apologize if I have
said anything untoward.

2183
02:15:57,333 --> 02:15:58,542
It was a pleasure to meet you.

2184
02:15:59,167 --> 02:16:00,542
If you ever come to Punjab
then do visit my village.

2185
02:16:00,667 --> 02:16:01,875
Bullewal Khurd.

2186
02:16:06,042 --> 02:16:07,042
Post Office Pehel.

2187
02:16:07,875 --> 02:16:08,500
Thank you.

2188
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:09,625
Freeze!

2189
02:16:09,875 --> 02:16:11,875
Put your hands where I can see them!

2190
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,292
Keep them in the air!

2191
02:16:56,917 --> 02:16:59,542
I cannot get through.

2192
02:17:11,625 --> 02:17:16,542
Headman, why are you staring
at the empty road like a lost cattle?

2193
02:17:17,333 --> 02:17:19,750
Does anyone who goes
abroad ever come back?

2194
02:17:21,750 --> 02:17:25,833
I think Jaggi must have taken up
a job of washing utensils at a hotel.

2195
02:17:27,042 --> 02:17:29,750
They don't even know whether
he gets two square meals..

2196
02:17:29,875 --> 02:17:33,792
Yet, they are expecting
him to get 1.5 crore rupees.

2197
02:17:33,917 --> 02:17:35,667
You, Bhangra dancer, come here.
Hold this.

2198
02:17:35,833 --> 02:17:38,000
Come on.
Come on.

2199
02:17:38,875 --> 02:17:41,250
Come on, guys. Join in. Come on.

2200
02:17:42,042 --> 02:17:42,917
Hello?

2201
02:17:43,333 --> 02:17:44,583
Listen up.

2202
02:17:45,167 --> 02:17:47,208
Like everyone knows..

2203
02:17:48,333 --> 02:17:52,708
People of Khurd were given
6 months and 7 days time..

2204
02:17:52,833 --> 02:17:55,292
..to collect 1.5 crore rupees.

2205
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:57,250
And time limit is over.

2206
02:17:57,667 --> 02:18:01,875
There are just 1 minutes
and 10 second left.

2207
02:18:02,250 --> 02:18:05,167
So that Mogi land..

2208
02:18:05,375 --> 02:18:10,708
..which was owned by Jaggi
Khuwala will now be owned by him.

2209
02:18:11,792 --> 02:18:14,458
No one is going to come.
Remove it. Throw it.

2210
02:18:14,833 --> 02:18:16,125
Ten..

2211
02:18:17,542 --> 02:18:18,667
Nine..

2212
02:18:20,042 --> 02:18:21,125
Eight..

2213
02:18:22,833 --> 02:18:24,042
Seven..

2214
02:18:24,792 --> 02:18:25,875
Six..

2215
02:18:26,625 --> 02:18:27,833
Five..

2216
02:18:28,583 --> 02:18:29,667
Four..

2217
02:18:30,333 --> 02:18:31,333
Three..

2218
02:18:32,083 --> 02:18:33,083
Two..

2219
02:18:34,292 --> 02:18:35,292
One..

2220
02:19:05,208 --> 02:19:07,375
You are back!

2221
02:19:10,625 --> 02:19:13,125
Jaggi, calm him down.

2222
02:19:13,375 --> 02:19:15,625
He shrunk to half his size crying.

2223
02:19:15,750 --> 02:19:17,500
But he was already half in size!

2224
02:19:20,958 --> 02:19:23,208
Jaggi..! No!

2225
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,792
Jaggi..!
You were right.

2226
02:19:26,667 --> 02:19:29,292
Right decisions are
taken from the heart.

2227
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:33,333
You can only do business
using your brains.

2228
02:19:46,458 --> 02:19:48,292
Count them,
they will be more than required.

2229
02:19:48,875 --> 02:19:51,042
- So much rupees?
- Dollars.

2230
02:19:51,958 --> 02:19:54,500
Headman, shame and moustaches
are two such things..

2231
02:19:55,875 --> 02:20:00,208
..which either come at the
right time or they don't come at all.

2232
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:02,417
Our manure has become a hit, Uncle!

2233
02:20:03,833 --> 02:20:05,667
This is just from Australia!

2234
02:20:06,292 --> 02:20:08,417
Dollars from America
and Canada are on their way.

2235
02:20:11,375 --> 02:20:13,333
Inspector, you should remember..

2236
02:20:13,750 --> 02:20:18,917
..you should never go back to
the village where you were insulted.

2237
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:56,333
" I'll no longer guard your wheat!"

2238
02:20:57,500 --> 02:20:58,667
Hello, dear!

2239
02:21:01,250 --> 02:21:03,750
Will anyone wish me hello-hi or not?

2240
02:21:09,042 --> 02:21:11,042
Roop, you don't need to be so angry.

2241
02:21:11,208 --> 02:21:12,917
Preet understands me.

2242
02:21:14,125 --> 02:21:14,792
Right?

2243
02:21:16,958 --> 02:21:17,875
Okay then.

2244
02:21:18,625 --> 02:21:20,880
I hit the CRP of
Australia and came here.

2245
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:21,792
For whom did I do that?

2246
02:21:21,917 --> 02:21:23,583
For both of you, you fools!

2247
02:21:25,667 --> 02:21:30,005
Freeze! Put your hands where
I can see them! Keep them in the air!

2248
02:21:30,125 --> 02:21:33,250
Anything you say can
and well can be used against you!

2249
02:21:33,375 --> 02:21:34,458
You are under arrest.

2250
02:21:35,042 --> 02:21:36,833
You're coming with us for interrogation.

2251
02:21:36,958 --> 02:21:38,542
- Have you ever seen Peshawar?
- No.

2252
02:21:38,667 --> 02:21:40,000
Good that you didn't.

2253
02:21:45,083 --> 02:21:46,333
He has come of age.

2254
02:21:46,917 --> 02:21:47,792
Look at his swag.

2255
02:21:47,917 --> 02:21:49,750
- Freeze!
- I will him them!

2256
02:21:50,125 --> 02:21:52,750
This is a very critical situation.

2257
02:21:52,875 --> 02:21:55,583
I think Jaggi and you will handle it.

2258
02:21:55,875 --> 02:21:56,958
I am leaving.

2259
02:22:00,292 --> 02:22:01,208
Stop.

2260
02:22:01,583 --> 02:22:02,667
Put your guns down.

2261
02:22:03,250 --> 02:22:04,500
Talk to your boss.

2262
02:22:04,875 --> 02:22:06,625
Jaggi, I've spoken to their boss.

2263
02:22:06,833 --> 02:22:08,625
They cannot arrest you for any case..

2264
02:22:08,833 --> 02:22:10,208
..because it was not your fault.

2265
02:22:10,333 --> 02:22:12,125
You have earned this money,
and you deserve it.

2266
02:22:12,250 --> 02:22:14,375
- Sorry, man.
- It's alright.

2267
02:22:16,125 --> 02:22:18,417
- Jaggi..
- Yeah, thank you, sir. Sorry for the inconvenience.

2268
02:22:32,250 --> 02:22:37,542
" We got together at Friends'
Junction Bar at night."

2269
02:22:37,667 --> 02:22:43,250
" We got together at Friends'
Junction Bar at night."

2270
02:22:43,375 --> 02:22:44,667
" Oh dear, I.."

2271
02:22:44,833 --> 02:22:46,083
" Oh dear, I.."

2272
02:22:46,208 --> 02:22:52,250
" Oh dear, I threw you out
of my heart and got drunk on brandy."

2273
02:22:52,375 --> 02:22:53,875
" At Friends'.."

2274
02:22:54,875 --> 02:23:00,292
" We got together at Friends'
Junction Bar at night."

2275
02:23:00,542 --> 02:23:06,500
" We got together at Friends'
Junction Bar at night."

2276
02:23:17,708 --> 02:23:23,542
" I get fueled up
and pour my heart out."

2277
02:23:23,792 --> 02:23:29,083
" And then I changed
my Status to Single."

2278
02:23:34,833 --> 02:23:40,500
" I get fueled up
and pour my heart out."

2279
02:23:40,875 --> 02:23:45,958
" And then I changed
my Status to Single."

2280
02:23:46,250 --> 02:23:47,458
" The path to your house.."

2281
02:23:47,583 --> 02:23:49,000
" The path to your house.."

2282
02:23:49,125 --> 02:23:51,792
" I stopped using
the path to your house."

2283
02:23:51,917 --> 02:23:54,963
" I can survive without you."

2284
02:23:55,083 --> 02:23:57,042
" At Friends'.."

2285
02:23:57,625 --> 02:24:03,250
" We got together at Friends'
Junction Bar at night."

2286
02:24:03,417 --> 02:24:09,250
" We got together at Friends'
Junction Bar at night."

2287
02:24:20,917 --> 02:24:25,958
" The mementos and letters,
I burnt them all."

2288
02:24:26,292 --> 02:24:28,875
" If you will have
a good time overseas.."

2289
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,833
" I too will enjoy myself out here."

2290
02:24:38,042 --> 02:24:43,250
" The mementos and letters,
I burnt them all."

2291
02:24:43,375 --> 02:24:46,005
" If you will have
a good time overseas.."

2292
02:24:46,125 --> 02:24:48,963
" I too will enjoy myself out here."

2293
02:24:49,083 --> 02:24:50,333
" I will find myself.."

2294
02:24:50,458 --> 02:24:51,875
" I will find myself.."

2295
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,750
" I will find myself a chick who is
a permanent resident overseas."

2296
02:24:54,875 --> 02:24:57,792
" Someone who is fairer than you."

2297
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,292
" At Friends'.."

2298
02:25:00,625 --> 02:25:06,167
