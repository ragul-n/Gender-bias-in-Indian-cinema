2
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,625
I am under so much stress
and you are not bothered at all!

3
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,708
Who else do I talk to?

4
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:26,500
Papa just survived a heart attack.
I can't tell my parents, can I?

5
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,500
Don't tell them.

6
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:29,500
And?

7
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,916
Don't tell anyone right now.

8
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,333
What do we do then?

9
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,875
We haven't confirmed the pregnancy yet.
Let's get the test done first.

10
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,833
Please check the map.

11
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,750
It has been five weeks Jithin.

12
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,125
Jitin!

13
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,916
What? Isn't that your name anymore?

14
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,666
You said you would only call me 'Jithu',
no matter what.

15
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:04,208
Consider yourself lucky
that I am not swearing right now.

16
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,375
Has the cat got your tongue?

17
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,416
I have been telling you.

18
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,125
Don't play around Jithu.

19
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,083
Honey, we can do everything as you wish.

20
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,875
What if I am pregnant? Address that first.

21
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:12,791
Are you okay?

22
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,166
Maybe it is gas. That bread was a little off.

23
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Apply some heat on the stomach,
you will feel better.

24
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,541
Get me a lemon on the way.

25
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:41,875
Shall we go?

26
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:55,899
<font color="#00ff00">Subtitles Exclusively Arranged By:-</font>
<font color="#ffff00"><b>Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain</b></font>

27
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:02,000
Keep some paper on your tummy
if its hurting.

28
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,875
Get a magazine from the glove box.

29
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:04,083
Do you think we can afford a baby right now?

30
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:13,791
May be not, but we will, if we have to.

31
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,791
You make it sound so easy.

32
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,625
Do you have any idea
what my body will have to go through?

33
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:34,000
Do you think people would leave me alone
if they come to know that I'm pregnant?

34
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:38,291
Can you imagine the social stigma
my family has to face?

35
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,375
If anything happens to my Papa,
I'll make you pay for it.

36
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,208
Why are you talking like this?

37
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,208
Then come up with a solution!

38
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,666
What's the big issue now?

39
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,458
So, we have no issues?

40
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,541
Of course, I shouldn't have expected
anything from you.

41
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,000
Sudha had warned me long ago!

42
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,000
What?

43
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:27,541
If I knew you were such an idiot,
I would have never gotten into this.

44
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:44,583
Maria, you should understand something;
I didn't force you to sleep with me.

45
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:50,125
Whatever we did, we did on mutual consent.

46
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,583
You wanted to chuck condoms
for better intimacy.

47
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,125
But you said that it was not
the time of ovulation.

48
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,333
That can vary a little sometimes.

49
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,291
How am I supposed to know that?

50
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,125
Why are you blaming me for everything?

51
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,375
I haven't gotten my periods.

52
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,958
None of my family knows about us.

53
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,333
And you don't even have a regular job.

54
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,958
My head isn't straight, think about a solution.

55
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,250
Please don't come up with lame excuses like,

56
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,375
We are not sure yet,
we will see when it comes to it etc.

57
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,750
Tell me what will we do if I am pregnant.

58
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,750
If that's the case, I will find a job.

59
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:51,541
And?

60
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:57,000
I will work and we will tell everything
to our parents, that's all!

61
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,916
As if there is a job waiting just for you.

62
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,750
My friends have told me about
a couple of openings.

63
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,666
Which friends?

64
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,041
Ani was talking about one.

65
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,208
Who else?

66
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,291
Ani has mentioned something. That's it.

67
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:27,875
That was in January, before the pandemic.
You are still relying on that?

68
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:39,375
You were the one who asked me to follow my passion
instead of going for a regular job!

69
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:44,208
Even my parents wanted otherwise,
but I listened to you.

70
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:48,083
Had you gotten me pregnant back then?

71
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,208
What should I do now?

72
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:56,041
So you'll create problems
and expect me to find the solutions!

73
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,625
I am getting worked up. Please say something.

74
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,375
Try to keep quiet for some time.
Talking is what gives you stress.

75
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,333
I want to talk it out.

76
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,458
I hope the result will be negative.

77
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,416
In my opinion, even this test is pointless.

78
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,250
I don't need your "opinion" right now.

79
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,041
Why did the stick show positive then?

80
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,416
You are not supposed to read it after 5 mins.

81
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,416
It was only four minutes.

82
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,416
If you were pregnant,
the line would have been clearer.

83
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,916
Then why the hell am I not getting my periods?

84
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,875
There must be other reasons.

85
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,666
Periods can be delayed due to stress.

86
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,875
But, by a whole week?

87
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,958
Most of my friends struggle with
PCOD, PCOS and all.

88
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,083
But I have always had my periods on time.

89
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:25,041
The past six months were really stressful.

90
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,666
Yeah, working from home is
taking a toll on everyone.

91
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:34,041
That's not an issue for me.
Rather, I can work at my own pace now.

92
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,583
What else might be causing stress
four your highness?

93
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:41,333
I am the one who does the cooking
and the cleaning.

94
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,791
And it is me who remembers
to pay the bills on time.

95
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,375
And you are saying that you are stressed!

96
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,666
Have you forgotten the hobos
you brought home?

97
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,500
I had to cook two meals per day for them.

98
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,583
And who else gets
all the necessary grocery on time?

99
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,083
So don't claim to be
the only one doing chores.

100
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:07,250
You did something once
and its a big deal now!

101
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,500
Have you forgotten everything?

102
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:14,416
When we shifted,
all the household works were on me.

103
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:21,708
After office, I had to take care
of housework too.

104
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,291
Then I took over, right?

105
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,375
After all those arguments.

106
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,083
See Maria, I get it.

107
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,458
May be its an occupational hazard
or whatever.

108
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:57,833
But your habit of making stories
is really helping you during arguments.

109
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,083
Now it's all become my fault!

110
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,958
And what fucking right do you have
to judge my profession?

111
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,541
According to you, I'm only a jobless loser!

112
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:13,166
An artist has better integrity than someone
who writes for a tabloid any day.

113
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:18,541
Where did your integrity disappear
while hogging on the tabloid writer?

114
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,958
You better stop this here.

115
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,125
Hello?

116
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,291
I can't think straight.

117
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,541
Cant imagine bringing up a child.

118
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,875
Let alone an abortion.

119
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,541
An ectopic pregnancy can mimic
these symptoms apparently.

120
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:13,708
Didn't you agree a little ago
that we may have misread the result?

121
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,208
I didn't say that.

122
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,791
Why do you always try to evade the issues?

123
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,416
Carry on.

124
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,333
You were saying that an ectopic pregnancy
could show false-positive.

125
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,125
Not that!

126
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:45,458
For God's sake can you stop
diagnosing on Google?

127
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,583
Is Google the problem, right now?

128
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,666
Are you prepared to be a parent?

129
00:19:55,791 --> 00:20:00,041
I cannot assure that I will be an excellent parent
from tomorrow onwards.

130
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,166
People don't become ideal parents overnight.

131
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,916
They get there gradually.

132
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,250
I am not talking about people, but you.

133
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,250
I am okay.

134
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,750
But I am not.

135
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:22,500
I was planning to apply for a PhD abroad
after my masters.

136
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,416
I had so many plans!

137
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,583
You can still do that.

138
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:28,666
Piss off!

139
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,041
You will just loiter around like other men.

140
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,083
And I will be stuck at home
with houseworks and the baby.

141
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,083
Why don't you ever see
how much I care for you?

142
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:56,416
I have been cleaning the house as you said
that you are allergic to dust.

143
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:01,416
You would just twist the narratives
as you please.

144
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:06,000
You would do it when I am your girlfriend.
Wait for us to get married.

145
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,208
You are generalizing way too much.

146
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Wouldn't it be a better idea
never to get married at all?

147
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,666
What makes you think so?

148
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,458
Are you really into marriage?

149
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,250
What's the matter?

150
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,375
It is just a piece of paper anyway.

151
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,833
I'd not call it just a piece of paper.

152
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,625
One should be able to walk out
at any point.

153
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,708
Would you want to walk out?

154
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,291
Maybe, after all, we are all humans.

155
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,916
Maria! what are you even trying to say?

156
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,833
Are you okay with an abortion?

157
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:28,958
In my opinion, a woman has absolute autonomy
over any decision concerning her body.

158
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:36,041
If I have to take all the decisions by myself,
then why the fuck are we together?

159
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:40,375
Why would I need a relationship?
I could just have one night stands instead.

160
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:45,500
Now, why don't you come down to reality
instead of going all theatrical.

161
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:53,458
I will go to any extent for your happiness
and our peace.

162
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,416
I see, what extent would that be?

163
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,125
I will be the one who goes through
a pregnancy and abortion!

164
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,250
Oh my God!! What is your actual question?

165
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,333
Are you okay with the concept of abortion?

166
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,375
If that is what you want, we will get that done.

167
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,583
Did you just agree to keep me quiet?

168
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:33,125
No. I am serious.
Let's do that if that's what you want.

169
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:38,875
But you shouldn't be depressed
or stressed out after that.

170
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,958
So I should handle the complete mental stress
and trauma all by myself!

171
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,541
Maria, can you please stop this blame-game?

172
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,250
It could be false positive, right?

173
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,625
There is a limit to my patience.
Been telling you it is nothing.

174
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:35,916
Don't you understand?

175
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:42,666
Keep your voice down. Why are you shouting?

176
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:46,500
All this shouting has made my stress really worse.

177
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,375
You yourself are responsible
for your BP and stress.

178
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:52,083
You don't fucking care about anyone
but yourself.

179
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:55,291
Everything is about you and your problems.

180
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:28,166
We are going to get the test done.
Let the result tell.

181
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:32,250
You still got plenty of time to start worrying.

182
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:35,375
One should carry the umbrella
only when it is raining.

183
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:41,583
Later, Later..
When are you actually gonna take a decision?

184
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,875
One should be prepared for life.

185
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:49,708
Take a look at your career.

186
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:53,750
Actors like Tovino and Sreenath Bhasi
are all of your age.

187
00:25:57,708 --> 00:26:01,125
At least one of us should be a bit serious
about things.

188
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:05,750
You can't imagine the mental stress
I am going through.

189
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:09,458
You can't stand me being cool and happy.

190
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,250
As a matter of fact,

191
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,250
Your carelessness is exactly my problem.

192
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:20,333
So you'd never ever leave me in peace!

193
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:27,958
Everybody has problems in their life.
We have to manage it together.

194
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:32,583
Start addressing my concerns. What if my family
or colleagues come to know about this?

195
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,583
What the hell do you want from me?

196
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:38,083
Keep your voice down!

197
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:46,000
You just give me a proper answer.
What are we going to do if I am pregnant?

198
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,500
Pregnancy is a biological process.

199
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:53,916
You are not the first woman
to give birth to a baby.

200
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:57,291
You should just follow
what other women have been doing.

201
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:01,541
It is not possible for me
to take over your pregnancy or delivery.

202
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,541
As if you can do that!

203
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,833
You are unable to even handle
a little bit of my excess emotions..

204
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:19,916
All that you can do is
trivialize my pain and my struggles.

205
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:22,125
And you are very good at that.

206
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,708
And he asks me to do like all women.

207
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,791
Now he will teach me
all about pregnancy and childbirth.

208
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:32,375
Can you stop shouting for a minute please?

209
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,708
Here comes Mr.Charles Darwin!

210
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:40,500
I should stop it seems, I am the one shouting?

211
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,125
Who else?

212
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,333
First of all, I just answered your questions.
I was not shouting.

213
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,875
You have no idea how you sound.

214
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:57,333
When I came with a problem to you,
you are telling me that all women deliver.

215
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:00,708
How fucking insensitive!, Dude!

216
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:21,375
We will get married, now stop worrying, okay?

217
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:29,500
If it was that easy to get married,
why are we hiding this relationship?

218
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,958
How can I introduce you at home?

219
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,000
Let us take one step at a time.

220
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:38,708
I will find a job and then we will tell them.

221
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:43,125
Not everything goes according to our plans.

222
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:49,125
For instance, did anyone foresee this pandemic
and that all our lives would get affected?

223
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:53,125
Circumstances change
and those who adapt to it can survive.

224
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:02,750
Is this the way I react when you come to me
with a problem or another?

225
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,125
I handle them with great care.

226
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:09,000
Yes. You pamper me and sing a lullaby too!

227
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:11,083
It is so comforting. You know?

228
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:15,708
Yes. That's exactly what I do.
You know why?

229
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,833
Because you are a fucking man child.

230
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:22,125
I don't want to look after
one more child right now.

231
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:24,000
I will look after the child.

232
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:27,625
Right! Will you breastfeed the baby
every alternate hour too?

233
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:28,916
And change the diapers?

234
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:31,083
Yes I will. Can you put an end to this now?

235
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:36,750
Maria, please learn to take life more practically.

236
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:40,916
Being emotional doesn't mean
you can take it all out on me!

237
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:45,333
Do you think I can't talk like you?
I am just trying to avoid such conversations.

238
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:50,583
Yea, that's why you have dumped
all the stress on me.

239
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:03,458
Do you see that paper cup?
It has been lying there for a week.

240
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:08,833
There is a doughnut box on the backseat
that was bought last month. Remember?

241
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:13,625
You do all the littering
and I have to do all the cleaning.

242
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:17,708
I am pissed off being your slave.

243
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,666
Any idea about the stress you give me?

244
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:29,583
It is pointless to apply makeup
and to polish yourself

245
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:33,333
If the space that we share is not kept clean.

246
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:38,000
I maintain personal hygiene and you don't.
That's not my fault.

247
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:42,333
The problem is with your upbringing.
You haven't learned any civic sense.

248
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:47,916
Oh so you think you are a gentleman?

249
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,708
You smell like a gutter!

250
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:55,250
Yeah yeah! As if this is the first time
I am living with someone!

251
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,583
Nobody has ever had a problem with my smell.

252
00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:01,666
Those women who lived with you
might have been filthy like you too.

253
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,125
You take shower only once in three days.

254
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:07,250
You do not brush until afternoon.

255
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:09,041
You don't even use a deodorant.

256
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:12,750
It's a relief that you use deodorant
even if you don't wipe your ass.

257
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:15,541
You cannot hide your 'civilized self' for long.

258
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:26,875
I have had many relationships,
but not one shitty as this.

259
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:30,833
Yea, I am not a slut
and haven't slept around with many.

260
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:35,916
So? Should one get
special brownie points for that?

261
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:38,500
Which century are you living in?

262
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:44,333
I am driving for fuck sake!

263
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,708
I dont care!

264
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:56,166
Go to your ex's if you miss them so much.

265
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,000
That's better.

266
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,291
Get lost !

267
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:02,541
Piece of shit! fuck off !

268
00:32:02,565 --> 00:33:02,565
<font color="#00ff00">Subtitles Exclusively Arranged By:-</font>
<font color="#ffff00"><b>Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain</b></font>

269
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:55,800
<font color="#00ff00">Subtitles Exclusively Arranged By:-</font>
<font color="#ffff00"><b>Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain</b></font>

270
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:01,833
Want water?

271
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:32,291
Where are you going?

272
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:36,458
My sister, who never call me even for my birthday,
rang me today.

273
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,375
Haven't you heard of sibling rivalry?

274
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:44,708
Of course! People who have siblings
are well aware of sibling rivalry.

275
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:48,666
My brother and I fight with each other
all the time.

276
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:55,500
But the only thing that unite us
is when we plot against our parents.

277
00:39:56,583 --> 00:40:00,416
Do you know why my sister rang me today?

278
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:08,041
She is pregnant and she wanted to tell me that
before telling even her husband.

279
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:10,750
Isn't that cute to have a sibling!

280
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:16,166
Many a times we would have felt
they are a nuisance!

281
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:25,583
But your sibling will be the one whom we can trust
even more than our parents.

282
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:33,583
Share your sibling experience with us today.

283
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,125
Is sibling rivalry a reality?
Or do you share a warm and intense relation?

284
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:45,666
Do call us and share your experience.
Dial 8080 Blue FM.

285
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,166
Achu, no. I don't want to see you again.

286
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:52,500
I may appear as a tough guy to others,
but it is just a mask.

287
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,708
A disguise for existence.

288
00:44:57,583 --> 00:45:01,125
Sometime back, when I had feelings for you,

289
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,083
I could not reveal it.

290
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:13,333
Finally, when I got the courage,
it was too late.

291
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:20,750
I would never forgive myself.

292
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:26,166
But that night, when I shut the door
upon your tears and walked away,

293
00:45:27,416 --> 00:45:33,791
There remained the image of that beautiful young girl
engraved in my mind.

294
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:40,375
That memory is enough for me
to cherish forever.

295
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:19,083
Yeah Vineeth... Whats up?

296
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:23,708
Mathu's marriage is fixed.
Hope you got the invitation?

297
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:27,291
No, i didn't. Cutting down on expenses
during lock-down, i suppose.

298
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:29,291
I have lost my sleep.

299
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:33,125
You were the one waiting for her
to get married.

300
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:37,416
My first ever love, lasted three and a half years,
got traumatized after that.

301
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,916
Nothing worked out after that.
I have no peace.

302
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:50,541
And the worst part is, she is getting married
to my junior at school, Jinu Mohan.

303
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:51,916
So what?

304
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:58,041
I am an ordinary Malayali male.
Not a woke like you.

305
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,333
I am sexually repressed and i have
sexual jealousy towards other men.

306
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:04,833
Especially the one marrying my lover!

307
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:07,625
Ex. That's an important term.
Don't forget that!

308
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:12,500
X and Y are for those who can move on.

309
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:15,708
She will always be my Desdemona!

310
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,458
Just move on. There's nothing else to do.

311
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:27,416
You are a lucky guy with a lovely wife
to fuck and cook for you!

312
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:29,291
Girlfriend.

313
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:34,125
It's been 5-6 months, right?
It's now a marriage.

314
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:38,208
While being single, you are concerned
about only society.

315
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:42,458
But when you are in a relationship,
you can't even think about the society!

316
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:44,916
Grass is always greener on the other side.

317
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:51,458
Too much of sincerity is a problem.
We, emotional men, take it to heart.

318
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,208
My post teenage life can be split into two phases;

319
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:03,041
One, in relationship.
Two, traumatized period after break-up.

320
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:07,416
By the time I slowly move on,
She'd post something against me on facebook again.

321
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,833
And i get depressed for another four weeks!

322
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:11,833
Unnecessary guilt is your problem.

323
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:16,125
Why does it bother you whatever she does?
Her life is all fine from what I know.

324
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:21,000
True, Jinu Mohan is well off and all!

325
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:23,666
You are only 28 now!

326
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,333
What is the relevance?

327
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:32,458
I understand your problem. Mathu is not a person.
She is a concept, a symbol.

328
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:36,375
Figment of imagination!

329
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:42,125
Are you telling me that the probability for a girl
with such gorgeous body and hair is zero?

330
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:45,375
You are proving my point yet again.

331
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:47,833
Whats your point?

332
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:50,708
Your trouble is not in telling goodbye to a girl.

333
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:57,000
If so, you'd have joined some whats app group for poets
or jumped in front of a train.

334
00:48:57,208 --> 00:49:02,333
You don't want to say goodbye to that time.
You don't want to grow basically.

335
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:08,625
That's good. That means
I still got a chance with young chics.

336
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:13,208
But you need permission from your wife
for everything.

337
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:16,458
There are problems in analyzing things
from outside.

338
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:18,833
Man, I gotta go. Call you later.

339
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:26,416
That aunty is coming with us till Putiya road.

340
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:29,041
That place is nearby.

341
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:29,916
Please come.

342
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:31,916
She can take a rikshaw.

343
00:49:35,416 --> 00:49:36,708
Unlock the door.

344
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:50,333
Sorry to be a bother.

345
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:52,708
That's okay.

346
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:58,375
Don't worry. I haven't got corona.

347
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,083
Got a swollen leg!

348
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:13,541
I used to do Ayurveda,
but my son doesn't like it.

349
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,750
He prefers modern medicine.

350
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:24,166
He consulted some doctor
and the doctor suggested a blood test.

351
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:28,833
Your son didn't come?

352
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,541
He is in Dubai.

353
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,791
What does he do?

354
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:35,583
He is a chef.
Working there for eight years now.

355
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:40,083
What did they say?

356
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:43,750
The result will come by evening.

357
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,083
Should we come again for the result?

358
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:53,375
Oh you are concerned about the driving?

359
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,500
They will email me.

360
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:57,250
Alright.

361
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:03,500
If you are pregnant,
don't bend or stretch too much.

362
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:05,833
Don't carry any weight.

363
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:12,875
It is not like before.
Girls are not very healthy these days.

364
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:15,833
Mostly due to lack of physical activity.

365
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:20,791
What do you do son?

366
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:22,291
I am an artist.

367
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:22,791
What?

368
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,500
He is an actor.

369
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,416
In TV?

370
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:31,500
Theaters mainly.
Have done small roles in a couple of films.

371
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,000
Whats your name?

372
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:36,291
Jitin Babusenan.

373
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,041
Oh! I haven't heard before.

374
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:44,250
They are all crazy about movies these days.

375
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:51,791
My sister's sister-in-law's son
is also acting in movies!

376
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:58,541
Well, one has to start by doing small roles
I suppose!

377
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:05,708
But you wouldn't get paid much
unless you become a big star.

378
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:12,875
How do you manage your expenses?

379
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:16,166
We don't spend much.

380
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:20,541
How about you darling,
do you work somewhere?

381
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:22,375
I am a journalist.

382
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:25,708
Oh! You look like one.

383
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:39,458
It is said that if wife earns more than the husband,
conflicts are assured.

384
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:51,416
Times have changed,
anyone would like to have a steady earning job.

385
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:57,666
How did your parents agree to the marriage?

386
00:52:58,166 --> 00:52:59,666
We are not married.

387
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:03,916
Oh, what are they saying?

388
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:05,583
We have not told anyone.

389
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,000
You seem tired.

390
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:16,250
Might be because I gave blood.

391
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,166
You gave two drops of blood, not two bottles!

392
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:23,875
Did I come to you telling that I am tired?

393
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:37,916
Hello

394
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,083
Why didn't you come?

395
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:46,125
Everyone asked about you.

396
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:54,000
Those are just excuses,
marriage is a marriage.

397
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,666
There were about a hundred people.

398
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:06,708
Almost a sixty from their side.

399
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:11,125
They are like that!

400
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,750
She will be 24 years by next year.

401
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:25,916
Studies can be continued after marriage.

402
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:29,666
That's what she said.

403
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:36,333
Everybody knows why they conducted
the wedding in a hurry.

404
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:41,750
Only very few people will know.

405
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:46,750
They can be excused
due to the current circumstances.

406
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:50,541
Yes.

407
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:54,666
Will you come this way sometime soon?

408
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:01,166
My son is doing good, he rings me everyday.

409
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:10,208
Oh! If I had gotten stuck there!

410
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:13,291
I cant think of it.

411
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:19,208
Please stop near that house.

412
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:28,791
It would be hell to stay in a flat for 5-6 months.

413
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,625
She made a primary contact with hundred people!

414
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:30,875
Imagine the test coming out negative
after all these arguments we had.

415
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:37,291
The argument is not about
the test being negative, but positive.

416
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:46,000
Isn't it better to stay calm
expecting it to be negative,

417
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:48,833
Than to get all worked out!

418
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:55,875
Today is not about you Jithu, it is about me.

419
00:56:57,916 --> 00:57:01,708
Can you stop being a narcissist
for like one second?

420
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,291
It is not always about you.

421
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:12,958
I should have seen the red flags long back.

422
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:17,666
Do you remember, when my parents
were harassing me over your message,

423
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:19,375
Where were you? At Munnar!

424
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:21,000
For your cousins wedding!

425
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:26,500
Why are you bringing up old fights now?

426
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:29,833
As if you don't do that.

427
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:36,291
Remember the fuss you made
when I gave a 'like' to Jose Mathew's facebook status?

428
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:37,500
It was "love".

429
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,666
Psycho!

430
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:54,666
Instead of correcting me all the time,
invest half of that time in analyzing yourself.

431
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:56,708
Same applies to you.

432
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:00,916
Hello Sir,

433
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:04,875
Yes Sir, Ajay Sir told me you would call.

434
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:07,333
I couldn't find the time all this while.

435
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:13,375
I was busy with the post production of two films,
going back and forth studios.

436
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:18,625
Okay, I will directly get to the questions
without wasting your time.

437
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:22,291
We can start with your new movie.

438
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,250
First of all, this cannot be called a movie.

439
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:31,875
When every other person is making short movies
and uploading on facebook and tiktok,

440
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:34,416
It is not proper to call this a movie.

441
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:36,875
The right word is cinema.

442
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:41,916
Then the responsibility of making it cinematic
falls on the shoulder of the director.

443
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:46,333
Yes, few words about your new film?

444
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:51,000
This is a feminist film.

445
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:56,791
Not just any feminist film,
rather a feminist film done by a male director.

446
00:58:56,916 --> 00:59:00,583
It is probably the first of that sort
in Malayalam film industry.

447
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:08,583
Can we call this an experimental film,
like your earlier works?

448
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:15,666
The term experiment is used
when we are not sure about what we are doing.

449
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:22,708
I was very sure about the film
by the time I finished writing it.

450
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:27,083
So there is no experiment involved.

451
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,458
Your film involves a scene where two buffaloes
are seen eating grass for a long time.

452
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,333
That takes nearly 5 minutes of the film.

453
00:59:40,458 --> 00:59:45,000
Don't you think such shots
which do not contribute much to the film,

454
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:47,833
Will divert the audience from the cinema?

455
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:52,791
Problem is when you see buffaloes
just as buffaloes.

456
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:59,666
You have to put an effort
to understand what it represents.

457
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,333
I am not blaming you but..

458
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:11,125
If Bergman or Tarkovsky takes a slow film,
no one would question it.

459
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:17,291
It shows the cultural and educational deterioration
of our society.

460
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:24,000
You are a director with
a unique style of film making.

461
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:30,000
Has any film maker inspired you
in developing such a style?

462
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:34,291
Most directors of Malayalam
have either assisted someone in the past,

463
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:36,875
Or studied film making from institutes.

464
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:43,083
I have not received any of such formal training,
so there is no shortage of originality.

465
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:49,375
When others copy from somewhere,
I have common lives to copy from.

466
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:57,458
I have heard you criticizing film schools
in other interviews as well.

467
01:00:57,666 --> 01:00:59,708
May I know why?

468
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:06,833
Cinema is an art form using imagination.
It cannot be taught in a school.

469
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:10,000
It should come naturally.

470
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:16,291
I don't find any use
except spending a lot of time and money.

471
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:25,791
Coming to your new film 'Tabala'
which is supposed to be a feminist film,

472
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:33,291
Being a woman, I am curious to know
how women are presented in the film.

473
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:36,375
Few words about that?

474
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:46,041
Mostly feminists and progressives fail to address
the problems of the common woman.

475
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:48,791
They just want to be like men.

476
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:55,458
But we forget about the areas
where only women can excel.

477
01:01:55,958 --> 01:01:59,208
For example, my grandmother
used to make very good sambar.

478
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:03,000
I have not met anyone
who makes such wonderful sambar.

479
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:06,250
My grandfather on the other hand
was a revenue officer.

480
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:10,541
If my grandmother preferred to be
a revenue officer rather than a housewife,

481
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:14,416
We all would have missed out on
such amazing sambar!

482
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:22,708
How can we be sure that we did not miss
a very efficient revenue officer?

483
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:29,333
Right! Not only my grandfather,
my father was also a government employee.

484
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:33,500
I was the only one who attempted
something differently.

485
01:02:36,583 --> 01:02:39,333
Though your films have gone to many festivals,

486
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:43,708
They don't have many audience back home.

487
01:02:44,666 --> 01:02:50,666
But a commercial drama would always
find audience easily.

488
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:54,916
Do you think this mentality should change?
Who is responsible for this?

489
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:58,583
Of course, It is the Government's fault.

490
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:04,750
If they can't find good films and provide
necessary fund and other help, who else will do?

491
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:08,458
Its all a publicity stunt these days.

492
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:12,666
Rajnikanth and Amitabh Bachan
are still given awards!

493
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,625
One last question.

494
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:24,666
Famous director Sunil Prasad described your cinema
using very harsh words.

495
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:29,333
He used the term 'poverty porn'
on his facebook post.

496
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:33,791
You were described as a person
exploiting peoples' misery.

497
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:37,458
Many other critiques have the same opinion.

498
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:39,875
How do you respond?

499
01:03:41,541 --> 01:03:44,083
Let me ask, who is this Sunil Prasad?

500
01:03:44,541 --> 01:03:47,041
How many of his films have been released?

501
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:50,291
I have never heard of him.

502
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:57,750
What can I comment about people
who try to insult their colleagues?

503
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:00,083
Their intention is not good.

504
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:04,000
On the contrary, they want to silence people
whom they don't like.

505
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:06,958
Everyone knows that.

506
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:09,125
I just have to tell the jealous,

507
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:12,916
I will do cinemas again and I am not going to stop.

508
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:21,375
Okay sir, great. Thank you for your valuable time
and best wishes for your new cinema.

509
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,708
When will you publish this?

510
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,750
Next week sir. I will send you the link.

511
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:33,625
Send me the draft soon,
we can correct any changes before publishing.

512
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,583
Ok sir.

513
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:05,333
Did you see the balm?

514
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,000
I had it in my bag.

515
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:06,333
You didn't have to tell to that aunty
that we are not married.

516
01:06:06,833 --> 01:06:09,791
So what? She left us in peace
at least for some time.

517
01:06:10,916 --> 01:06:13,000
Not because you are giving up on us?

518
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,166
I understand your psychology.

519
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:24,500
Maybe, as she is of my mothers age,
it could be my Oedipal Complex

520
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:29,250
Which made me tell her that I am available.
How about analyzing it that way?

521
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:34,708
That's possible. You can use humor
as means of hiding your embarrassment.

522
01:06:57,208 --> 01:06:59,250
So, Who were you talking to?

523
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:03,958
I was waiting for that question!

524
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,375
Yeah, tell me.

525
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:07,166
It was Vineeth.

526
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,291
Vineeth or Vineetha?

527
01:07:17,791 --> 01:07:20,083
How did he call exactly when I went out?

528
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,333
Whats so special about that time?

529
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,208
He had called me in the morning,
I couldn't answer

530
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:30,083
Where are his chat messages?
Why do you delete them?

531
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:32,208
If there's anything, we talk over phone.

532
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:35,083
If I chat, he spams and then I have to delete.

533
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:44,041
Not because you don't want me to see
the photos and videos of girls he send.

534
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:47,375
It shouldn't concern you
as long as I don't keep them.

535
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:50,916
My problem is that he is sending them.

536
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:55,708
All guys do that. No big deal.

537
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:59,541
I am not sending or keeping it.
Then where is the problem?

538
01:08:00,416 --> 01:08:03,000
But he knows that you are committed.

539
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:05,750
He would be forwarding it to everyone.

540
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:07,041
I don't think so.

541
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,041
You should clearly tell him.

542
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:12,125
Not to send porn.

543
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:14,458
Okay.

544
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:27,958
He and his brohood!

545
01:08:29,916 --> 01:08:32,125
And he claims to be all progressive!

546
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:39,708
And it's okay when you and your girlfriends
shut yourself in the room and kiss each other?

547
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:47,666
That is wrong on so many different levels!

548
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:53,125
You have no clue about a woman's world.

549
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:54,375
No clue.

550
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:09,916
Did you text him asking to call you
and then delete the text? Tell me the truth!

551
01:09:11,416 --> 01:09:15,166
Maria, you are crazy.
I could have just called him if I wanted.

552
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:18,250
It was he who called me.

553
01:09:19,541 --> 01:09:20,375
I promise.

554
01:09:20,375 --> 01:09:21,291
Good for you.

555
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:29,083
I hate that guy!

556
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:31,875
He is not a bother.

557
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:35,666
He is so full of insecurities and jealousy.

558
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,875
Right, you talk as if I am Mr.Ambani!

559
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:40,833
You have a stable relationship!

560
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:43,083
Small, but you have roles in cinema.

561
01:09:43,583 --> 01:09:45,541
They are all jealous, okay?

562
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:48,208
Is there anyone without issues?

563
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,041
That's none of my business.

564
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:53,625
I have cut my friends off whenever you asked.

565
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:58,625
That Sumesh was a friend of 15 years!
I ended it just because of you!

566
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:01,083
You are comparing him to the flirts!

567
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:04,708
Opposite gender would be a problem for you!
I don't believe men.

568
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:07,791
You can have female friends if you want.
I don't care!

569
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,500
But I don't have any.

570
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:12,500
That's not my problem.

571
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:29,333
Will you stop talking to him?

572
01:10:29,916 --> 01:10:30,375
Okay!

573
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:39,333
You can call once in a while if you want.

574
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:42,958
Better to have friends that match our class!

575
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:04,041
I am having a bad headache. Get me a tea.

576
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:10,041
It can be due to dehydration, have some water.

577
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,333
I need tea, not water.

578
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:47,416
Check if there's any bakery on the way.

579
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:49,416
Get it in a paper cup.

580
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:53,833
Let me find a shop.

581
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:55,708
Will find if you look.

582
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,083
Then you look!

583
01:12:40,375 --> 01:12:41,750
Shall I get from here?

584
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:42,208
Yes.

585
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,458
What did mom say?

586
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,291
Dear Ann, when you share a space with others
you have to share a few responsibilities too.

587
01:13:31,416 --> 01:13:34,875
You don't have to take over
all the responsibilities, but..

588
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:37,166
Oh God! What is this Ann?

589
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:02,833
Whatever you say, they are your parents!

590
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:06,375
They will have some concerns.

591
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,541
This is not your Bangalore!

592
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:33,375
You take a break and go to Valpara with him.

593
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:44,500
Don't come here, there are containment zones
and lot of cases everywhere.

594
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:49,250
I don't mean that you have disease;
Outside vehicles are not permitted here.

595
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:55,791
I am outside. Will call you when I am back.

596
01:14:58,375 --> 01:14:59,208
Only tea?

597
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:01,041
What do you mean?

598
01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:05,833
Could have bought something to eat as well.

599
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:08,625
I cannot predict your thoughts.

600
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:10,916
You asked me to buy tea, i bought tea.

601
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:14,833
You just need some common sense for that.

602
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,416
It is fine if you don't appreciate anything,
but why do you blame for everything?

603
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:26,458
As if you bought me a diamond necklace!

604
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:31,083
Shall I get something to eat?

605
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:35,333
The tea will be cold by then. It's fine.

606
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:59,458
It was Ann, she had a huge fight with mom.

607
01:16:00,541 --> 01:16:03,541
Praveen wanted to come home and meet her.
Mom said no.

608
01:16:03,916 --> 01:16:07,750
What else does she expect?
At least she gets to meet him outside!

609
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:12,000
That's what I told her too.
She's blabbering something.

610
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,708
This tea is really good.

611
01:16:32,375 --> 01:16:33,333
You want some?

612
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,833
I don't like tea.

613
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:36,583
Its good.

614
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:41,916
Not just this tea, no tea in the world is good.

615
01:16:42,333 --> 01:16:44,125
Good tea is an oxymoron.

616
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:47,333
Okay Mr. White Guy!

617
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:31,541
Do I look bloated?

618
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:33,208
What?

619
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:39,583
Have I put on weight?
Why do you keep looking at my clothes?

620
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:47,625
Because you look beautiful.

621
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:50,708
Yeah?

622
01:18:16,416 --> 01:18:17,000
Sorry.

623
01:18:46,541 --> 01:18:47,208
Are you ok?

624
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:47,708
Yes.

625
01:19:46,291 --> 01:19:47,458
Got my periods!

626
01:20:54,041 --> 01:20:56,708
Stop near a medical shop, pad is over.

627
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:01,750
Meftal too.

628
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:03,208
We will get it.

629
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:06,916
Mornings...

630
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:11,833
Weave together, into my eyes

631
01:22:12,416 --> 01:22:14,833
Blankets of rain

632
01:22:15,416 --> 01:22:20,625
Amongst the cracks of my bones

633
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:23,833
Bloom

634
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:27,833
Little liberty caps

635
01:22:27,833 --> 01:22:32,333
Your lips,dipped in madness,

636
01:22:33,833 --> 01:22:37,833
Churn out those words

637
01:22:38,833 --> 01:22:41,833
Of the same tone

638
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:45,833
Of the same type

639
01:22:47,416 --> 01:22:52,500
Nights, wrap around

640
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:57,833
Glossy attires, of darkness

641
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:04,125
Snakes, mate in pairs

642
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:09,833
Along the twisted tufts of your dense hair

643
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:17,041
Your lips, dipped in madness,

644
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:21,625
Churn out those words

645
01:23:21,833 --> 01:23:24,750
Of the same tone

646
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:28,625
Of the same type

647
01:23:57,125 --> 01:24:02,291
You use your words as stakes

648
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:07,625
And impale my heart with them.

649
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:13,833
In the same way

650
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:19,166
I forgot to utter my silences

651
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:24,833
The leaves will fall around

652
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:30,833
With trees watching still

653
01:24:31,625 --> 01:24:36,625
Along the window panes, shall crawl-

654
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:43,041
Little termites,with tall legs

655
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:48,833
Your lips, dipped in madness,

656
01:24:49,833 --> 01:24:53,833
Churn out those words

657
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:57,833
Of the same tone

658
01:24:57,833 --> 01:25:01,833
Of the same type

659
01:25:01,857 --> 01:25:31,857
