1
00:01:05,112 --> 00:01:08,104
"100 years ago"

2
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:17,522
"In an Indian family"

3
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:25,122
"A child was born,
who was an ideal of sacrifice"

4
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:28,126
"100 years ago"

5
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:39,135
"Destiny was very cruel
with this child"

6
00:01:41,148 --> 00:01:46,643
"He was a baby
when he lost his mother"

7
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:58,156
"His step-mother
didn't love him"

8
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:05,104
"He had a father, a home,
but he was still an orphan"

9
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:15,514
"The delicate flower never
saw spring, only fall"

10
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:23,113
"A child was born,
who was an ideal of sacrifice"

11
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:26,117
"100 years ago"

12
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:38,128
"He was a kind man who could
not bear to see others in pain"

13
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:45,135
"He always wiped
other people's tears"

14
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,552
"Women were suppressed, people
were still in the dark ages"

15
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:00,490
"Death danced everywhere"

16
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:04,086
"People were hungry"

17
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:14,097
"He became a recluse, when he
saw so much suffering around"

18
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:21,104
"A child was born,
who was an ideal of sacrifice"

19
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:24,112
"100 years ago"

20
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:35,527
"The fear that his son
may become an ascetic"

21
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:43,126
"Made his father get him
engaged to a beautiful girl"

22
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:51,542
"He did not go
against his father"

23
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:54,545
"But sent a letter to the girl"

24
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:58,549
"l tread a difficult path"

25
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:02,087
"My ideal is to serve mankind"

26
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:09,084
"l want to give my love"

27
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:12,090
"To the whole world"

28
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:19,095
"A child was born,
who was an ideal of sacrifice"

29
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:22,100
"100 years ago"

30
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:32,111
"' Dear sir,
greetings"'

31
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:35,519
' My letter must
have surprised you'

32
00:04:37,123 --> 00:04:39,114
' It's possible
you even get angry'

33
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:44,520
' You may consider what l
am writing to be rude'

34
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:53,131
' But hiding anything about
myself will be a sin'

35
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:00,477
' I got engaged to your daughter
only to please my father'

36
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:04,482
' But my life's aim is
to serve mankind'

37
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:08,077
' For which I have a strong
feeling to become an ascetic'

38
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:11,082
'Which hasn't reduced
even after getting engaged'

39
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:15,484
"Which means, he will get
married, and also be an ascetic?"

40
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:18,493
Yes!
What high ideals he has!

41
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:20,290
You keep quiet!

42
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:27,096
I had my suspicions when he
disappeared on the engagement day.

43
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,099
But he hasn't
refused to get married.

44
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,107
That's worst.

45
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:34,509
You people are
unnecessarily arguing.

46
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:38,107
Who knows?
Maybe Kumud likes such a man.

47
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:42,113
"Whether Kumud likes him or not,
looks like you sure like him."

48
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:43,244
Leave!

49
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:46,120
"Kusum, don't tell Kumud
anything about this."

50
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,521
Why should l?

51
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:02,473
"What he should
have asked me,..."

52
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:04,475
... why did he have to
write about it to my family?

53
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,073
"He has asked you, but he
had to write to the family."

54
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:15,079
God! Wonder how even the
food stays in your stomach.

55
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:23,492
"- Why did you tell her?
- I didn't, she heard everything."

56
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:26,088
"- Alright, you go out.
- I'm going."

57
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,501
"And where food is concerned,
I hardly eat anything."

58
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:35,506
"Kumud, don't listen to her
and upset yourself."

59
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:38,100
"Seeing your beautiful face,..."

60
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:40,109
... son-in-law will
forget all his ideals.

61
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,521
"Before the family replies to him,
you send him your reply."

62
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:53,115
Or you'll have
to sit and regret.

63
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,124
You've come again!
Come!

64
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:13,072
"' Dear, my letter..."'

65
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:19,475
Didn't you feel ashamed
stealing your nephew's letter?

66
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:23,487
"And daughter-in-law, have you
also lost your senses..."

67
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,490
... to read your son's letter?

68
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:29,494
How was I to know that a decent
looking girl like Kumud...

69
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:32,497
... will write love letters
to her fiance before marriage?

70
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:39,095
Saraswati is very fortunate
to get such a loving wife.

71
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:45,100
Saw how the
old woman taunted me?

72
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:49,104
"- Read this letter, son.
- Whose letter is it, grandma?"

73
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:51,112
Just read it.

74
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:06,464
Read it aloud.
Let me hear what's written.

75
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:14,472
"' Dear, you will be
surprised to receive my letter"'

76
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:21,479
"' But my heart has made me
helpless, so this step"'

77
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:24,481
Whose letter is this?

78
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:27,476
What kind of letters are
we receiving at home now?

79
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:31,079
Just read it and you
will understand everything.

80
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:36,288
' I have never seen you'

81
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:39,090
' But I have imagined how
you must be a thousand times'

82
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,498
' I have seen you in my dreams'

83
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:44,501
' I know your thoughts
from your books'

84
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:50,499
' Your poems have given me an
insight to your beautiful heart'

85
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,509
For who is this letter?

86
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:02,451
"Grandma,...Saraswati Chander...
This is not my letter."

87
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:05,046
Alright...alright.

88
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:24,475
What is the matter?

89
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:29,471
"lf father comes to know of this,
it will be such an embarrassment."

90
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:32,075
What does this mean?

91
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,085
-This is your fiancee's letter.
-Why did she have to write to me?

92
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:44,495
She's fallen in love with you.

93
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:47,097
I don't like such crap.

94
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,092
I'll forbid her
from doing this again.

95
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:06,114
Kumud's letter reminded me
of that day...

96
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:09,312
... when you'd written
the first love letter to me.

97
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:11,717
Come on! You are a
father of five children now.

98
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,524
How can you
still be so romantic?

99
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:17,528
"Chandrakant,
I'm late for office."

100
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,531
- Please post this letter for me.
- I will.

101
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:26,537
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

102
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:33,134
What now?

103
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,142
Such a long letter!

104
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:44,147
' Dear Kumud'...that's all?

105
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:59,170
"' Miss Kumud, I have
never loved anyone..."'

106
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:03,502
'... nor do I know
how to write love letters'

107
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,510
' I don't like such crap
as love'

108
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:12,517
"' My love lies in serving mankind,
serving the country"'

109
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:16,520
"' Today, when the country is
reeling under slavery & hunger..."'

110
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:20,115
'... India
needs men and women...'

111
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:23,124
'... who give up everything
and get into serving people'

112
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,533
'We should put our entire
effort into serving people'

113
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:34,129
"'So, I hope, you will henceforth
not write such letters to me"'

114
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:42,547
' PS:lf you need to send
some important message...'

115
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:47,142
'... send it on
Chandrakant's address'

116
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:54,558
You are the most crooked
celibate of the world!

117
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:57,152
I'll set you right!

118
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:35,123
"I've sent you a
flower in the letter"

119
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:40,128
"It's not a flower,
but my heart"

120
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,543
"My dearest, write to me..."

121
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:59,150
"... if it is worthy of you"

122
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,493
"There is so much love
hidden in your letters"

123
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:09,501
"As much as there
are pearls in the sea"

124
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:28,111
"l would kiss your hand,
if you were here with me"

125
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:34,116
"I've sent a flower..."

126
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,543
"You must be sleeping"

127
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:55,546
"What dream did you see"

128
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:15,490
"When I opened my eyes,
I was all alone"

129
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:20,095
"l could not realise my dream"

130
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:25,109
"l will eliminate
your loneliness"

131
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:29,106
"Take me as your bride"

132
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:39,524
"After intensifying our love,
don't forget"

133
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:44,529
"lt is you who
taught me to love"

134
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:49,124
"I've sent you a flower..."

135
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,503
"Letters are
not enough any more"

136
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:30,508
"I'll feel at peace only
when I see you now"

137
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:50,528
"That the moon
lands in my courtyard"

138
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,533
"l want those moments"

139
00:15:56,135 --> 00:16:00,128
"How do we meet"

140
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:05,076
"Write me a way"

141
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:15,084
"I'm waiting for you"

142
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:19,481
"Write when you will come home"

143
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:24,495
"I've sent you a flower..."

144
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:39,509
He's coming to our house.

145
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:43,104
Someone must go to receive him.

146
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:46,508
So what if we are not related.
We have to show some humanity.

147
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:48,516
Show humanity to that nut?

148
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:50,313
"lf he wants to
become a recluse,..."

149
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:51,720
... Iet him go to the
jungles and meditate.

150
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,122
Why is he coming here?

151
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:57,527
"Grandpa, Saraswati Chander
has come."

152
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,529
I'll go to the door!

153
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:04,061
"No father, you are hot tempered.
You don't go, I'll go."

154
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:09,064
"Look, make him sit outside,
don't bring him indoors."

155
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:14,478
Let me also see him.
I've heard he's very handsome.

156
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,669
Not at all!

157
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:19,074
"It's a man's qualities,
not his face that matters."

158
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,079
Bless you.

159
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:30,494
You don't seem to be
happy to see me here.

160
00:17:31,097 --> 00:17:33,497
"No, it's not that."

161
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,503
Actually...
It's good you have come.

162
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:43,508
- Who is he?
- He's grandpa.

163
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:53,108
"I'll have to learn to
live from you, grandpa."

164
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,111
Only a man who carries
a sword in his hand...

165
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:56,516
... can survive in this world.

166
00:17:57,123 --> 00:17:58,522
Well said!

167
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:03,461
I saw him and knew that
the boy is very talented.

168
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:06,463
What are you waiting
here for? Come inside.

169
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:09,057
"Surjan Singh,
have his luggage sent up."

170
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:35,082
Hello.

171
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:47,095
Hello.
I've brought breakfast for you.

172
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:48,495
Sit down.

173
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,051
You...

174
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:05,451
"I'm not her. I'm
her younger sister, Kusum."

175
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:07,457
- What!
- Please eat.

176
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:17,458
Come!

177
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,471
"Here, brother-in-law.
Recognise her properly."

178
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:24,065
You didn't even say
' hello' to each other.

179
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:25,208
Hello.

180
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:27,268
"Don't make a mistake now,
brother-in-law."

181
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,075
She's the one who wrote so many
letters to you & called you here.

182
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:32,275
Just shut-up!

183
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:35,079
"You are engaged to her,
and even your marriage..."

184
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:38,082
- Will you keep quiet!
- Why are you feeling shy now?

185
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:42,092
"ln the morning,you were so eager
to know which room he was in."

186
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:44,486
Now sit and talk to him.

187
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:46,087
"- Kusum.
- Coming, Ma!"

188
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:50,090
"Coming, Ma!"

189
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:31,132
"When I was away from you, you
asked me to come and meet you."

190
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:35,545
"Now that I have come,
you are staying away from me."

191
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:40,141
Why are you troubling me?
Please come to me.

192
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:43,144
I have so much
to talk with you.

193
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:47,148
"So much, that even if God
grants me seven lives..."

194
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:49,158
... my talks won't be over.

195
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:54,154
Hello.

196
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:03,505
It's very hot today.
....Come inside.

197
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:08,503
Why are you being
so formal with me?

198
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:11,105
I'm not being formal.

199
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:17,110
"Please take a seat, miss."

200
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,525
"l mean, sit down."

201
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:27,120
'Celibacy'

202
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:31,128
- What book is that?
- It's just a book.

203
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:35,132
"- You have written it?
- Yes, I had."

204
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:39,133
I wanted to remain single
in order to serve mankind.

205
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:44,547
"Why don't you sit down? Sit down,
then we can talk comfortably."

206
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,139
You sit down first.

207
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:02,099
You didn't say
anything on seeing me.

208
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:05,493
"l did.
Seeing you, l..."

209
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:10,098
- Your...
- My what?

210
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,503
The roof of this
room is very nice.

211
00:22:17,116 --> 00:22:18,515
- Roof?
- Sister!

212
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:20,507
I'm going!

213
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,710
But I haven't spoken
anything with you yet.

214
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:24,521
Nor have you said anything.

215
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:27,524
"- Where are you going, sister?
- I'm going."

216
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:32,529
You really are the sweetest
dumb fellow on earth.

217
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:38,526
Four? I will surely
get a seven this time.

218
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:44,143
"1, 2, 3, 4...Once more. If l
don't get it this time..."

219
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:45,132
... I'll stop playing.

220
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:51,141
I must get seven!
...Seven!

221
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,543
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7!
Brother-in-law is..."

222
00:23:04,496 --> 00:23:07,090
- What happened?
- Nothing. You continue.

223
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:09,091
I'll get chilled
sherbet for you.

224
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:12,696
"- Even I am thirsty.
- Wait, even I am coming."

225
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:16,302
"No sister, you sit.
He's badly beaten."

226
00:23:16,508 --> 00:23:19,102
"Serve him some fruits,
he'll come to his sense then."

227
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:36,117
- Why don't you eat something?
- You are not giving me.

228
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:38,519
I am telling you.
Eat that apple.

229
00:23:39,531 --> 00:23:40,520
Give me.

230
00:23:45,137 --> 00:23:47,128
You don't even give alms
to a beggar like that.

231
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,132
- Why do you talk like that?
- Then give me.

232
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:05,079
"Brother-in-law,
drink chilled sherbet."

233
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:31,598
Close the door behind you.

234
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:48,524
What if anyone hears you?
Have you gone crazy?

235
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:53,530
Not yet. But don't blame me
if I do become crazy.

236
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:45,516
"Your body smooth as
sandalwood, your naughty nature"

237
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:50,521
"Your slow smile"

238
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:05,459
"Don't blame me, O world"

239
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:15,071
"lf I become crazy"

240
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,076
"Your body smooth..."

241
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:40,504
"Your eyebrows work as bows"

242
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:45,099
"For your piercing eyes"

243
00:27:57,723 --> 00:28:02,456
"A dot like the
shinning sun on your head"

244
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:07,064
"Your lips hot burning sparks"

245
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:11,459
"Even your shadow"

246
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:21,478
"Can make a lonely heart bloom"

247
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,074
"Your body smooth..."

248
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:51,508
"Your body is beautiful,
your heart is beautiful"

249
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,511
"You are an image of beauty"

250
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:13,464
"Others may not
need you as much"

251
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:18,469
"But I need you very much"

252
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:23,474
"My heart has craved enough"

253
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,074
"Don't make it crave anymore"

254
00:29:33,485 --> 00:29:38,081
"Your body smooth..."

255
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,113
It's so late in the morning.
Why didn't you wake me up?

256
00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:13,519
How could I wake you?
You slept only in the morning.

257
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:19,529
Send a letter that you
have reached safely.

258
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:21,121
Yes.

259
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:27,127
Bless you.

260
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:33,543
I'll take your leave.

261
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:38,139
Ask your father to
reply to my letter soon.

262
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,539
I will.

263
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:41,150
I want to finish off
with my responsibility.

264
00:30:42,154 --> 00:30:43,143
Come.

265
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,152
"Let's go, it's getting late.
The ship will leave."

266
00:31:03,108 --> 00:31:05,508
"What happened, son?
Have you forgotten something?"

267
00:31:06,111 --> 00:31:07,100
Yes.

268
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:10,110
"What did you forget, son?
Tell me, I'll get it for you."

269
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:12,510
Where will you search for it?

270
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:15,518
"You only go and get it, son."

271
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:17,110
Yes.

272
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:37,139
- Why did you come back?
- I want to talk to you.

273
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:41,137
"lf you want to talk to me,
why are you leaving so soon?"

274
00:31:42,147 --> 00:31:45,548
I got a letter from home.
My grandma is not keeping well.

275
00:31:48,553 --> 00:31:53,547
"And anyway, the sooner I go,
the sooner we'll get married."

276
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:58,152
Wonder how long that will be.

277
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:01,496
How will I spend our days
of separation without you?

278
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,091
That is what l
want to talk to you about.

279
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:09,496
"l have to go, though
I hate going without you."

280
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:14,101
My feet have turned to stone.

281
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:20,107
I feel the way Lord Krishna
had eloped Rukmini...

282
00:32:20,252 --> 00:32:22,117
"... Iikewise, even I feel like
taking you away from here."

283
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,112
I haven't stopped you.

284
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,524
There is still time for that.

285
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:32,119
You'll have to come back
as a groom again.

286
00:33:00,158 --> 00:33:04,094
- Do you see that brother?
- I'm seeing everything.

287
00:33:05,096 --> 00:33:07,087
Only the picture has come yet.

288
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:09,498
"When she herself comes,
watch what happens then."

289
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:17,497
Give me way.

290
00:33:21,112 --> 00:33:22,101
Give me way.

291
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:28,108
If my sister doesn't do
anything about this...

292
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,118
... I'll soon have to
go out of this house.

293
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:35,516
"I'm telling you, let me manage
the accounts along with Saraswati."

294
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:38,519
Careful.

295
00:33:45,537 --> 00:33:49,132
She's beautiful.

296
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:53,136
"Grandma,the doctor has forbidden
you from getting out of bed."

297
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:55,143
And you walked up to here?

298
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:57,139
"Come, I'll escort
you to your room."

299
00:33:57,282 --> 00:34:02,481
Forget the doctors. She is
the cure to my illness.

300
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:09,493
I'll be happy to die
after she comes to this house.

301
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:12,085
"Chandrakant, is the ring ready?"

302
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:16,490
How can it not be?

303
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:17,690
Take.

304
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:23,506
I got it made for a bargain
price of Rs.5000.

305
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:25,098
"Look, grandma."

306
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:28,101
It's lovely.

307
00:34:29,114 --> 00:34:30,103
Rs.5000!

308
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:35,518
"Being a mother, you are
complaining about your son to me?"

309
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:38,113
You should feel ashamed!

310
00:34:38,256 --> 00:34:41,521
"Oh yes, I am shameless!
Say whatever else you want to."

311
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:45,528
But get this clear. I don't
trust your son anymore.

312
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,528
He is spending so much money.

313
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:50,724
Atleast you keep
a check on him.

314
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:53,331
Even my Dhanbhai is your son.

315
00:34:53,538 --> 00:34:55,529
Or have you picked
him from the street?

316
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,140
You divide the property
between them now itself.

317
00:34:58,276 --> 00:34:59,743
What nonsense are you talking!

318
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:03,072
Then atleast let Dhuradh
manage the accounts with him.

319
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:05,472
You don't have the time
to look into the accounts.

320
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:08,074
There should atleast be some
elder to monitor Saraswati.

321
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:13,490
"Chandrakant,
I was not destined for love."

322
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:17,084
What happened?
Did your father say something?

323
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:20,496
No one told me anything.

324
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:23,690
I understand everything.

325
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:28,102
"But the problem is,
I cannot fight with your mother."

326
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:34,103
And she won't rest in peace until
she has secured her son's future.

327
00:35:35,113 --> 00:35:38,105
I am happy about that.
Dhanbhai is my brother.

328
00:35:38,516 --> 00:35:42,111
Grandma is serious. You've
been called home immediately.

329
00:36:01,473 --> 00:36:02,462
Grandma.

330
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:09,069
"Son, I have transferred my
entire wealth in your name."

331
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:13,073
"No grandma, I don't want it."

332
00:36:13,685 --> 00:36:16,085
You are very naive.

333
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:22,492
"You are not worldly wise,
but I am."

334
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:28,088
Then transfer the property
in Dhanbhai's name.

335
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:33,503
Or it will ruin the peace
of the family.

336
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:41,102
"This is my last wish, son.
Accept it...Accept it, son."

337
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:10,070
It's Saraswati's letter?
Give it to me.

338
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:13,066
"Kusum, it is not right
to read anyone's letter."

339
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:14,200
Give it to me.

340
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:17,673
"- Give it to me, or else...
- What will you do?"

341
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:21,074
- I'll tell father.
- What will you tell him?

342
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:26,082
"I'll say...whatever I say,
what have you got to with it?"

343
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:28,488
- Give me the letter.
- No.

344
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:36,499
- Naughty!
- This is not Saraswati's letter.

345
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:40,093
It's a letter father has
written about your marriage.

346
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:41,500
Look.

347
00:37:43,107 --> 00:37:45,507
I was going to give it to the
gardener to post it.

348
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:48,706
Why?
Don't want the letter any more?

349
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:51,513
What will I do with that letter?
Give it to the gardener.

350
00:37:51,716 --> 00:37:54,514
Ask me the
marriage date atleast.

351
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:57,119
Why should I ask?
Keep the date to yourself.

352
00:37:57,522 --> 00:38:03,051
As if I am going to
get married to Saraswati.

353
00:38:04,062 --> 00:38:05,461
Listen...when is the marriage?

354
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:12,469
- Listen!
- What is it?

355
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,661
Saraswati's in-laws
have sent a letter.

356
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:17,064
They are asking for
marriage in March.

357
00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:20,472
Then give your consent.
Why are you asking me?

358
00:38:20,678 --> 00:38:23,078
The thought of his marriage
makes my heart pound.

359
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:26,473
- Why?
- She hasn't even come home yet.

360
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:29,485
Only her picture in the house
took one life.

361
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:32,485
Wonder what will happen
when she comes home.

362
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:36,492
"- You talk like fools!
- Oh yes, I am a fool."

363
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:39,086
The knowledgeable
one is going to come.

364
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,097
That is what you say
and suppress my voice.

365
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,491
But I won't stay quiet now.

366
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:48,368
Wonder what magic spell
she has cast...

367
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,497
... you count my
son among the dead.

368
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:52,701
Don't ever say that again.

369
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:55,102
I treat both my sons equally.

370
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:59,515
Nonsense! Grandma bequeathed
all her wealth to him.

371
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:01,449
But you didn't protest.

372
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:04,453
That was mother's wealth. She
gave it to him of her own will.

373
00:39:04,555 --> 00:39:07,456
Did you protest when
she took all my money?

374
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:11,051
You sold shares & invested your
money in loans and lost it.

375
00:39:11,195 --> 00:39:13,060
How is Saraswati to
be blamed for it?

376
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:16,062
Forget all that.

377
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:19,459
Do you know that Saraswati
has got a ring made of Rs.5000.

378
00:39:20,071 --> 00:39:26,476
- Ring of Rs.5000?
- Yes. Rs.5000! For his wife.

379
00:39:26,678 --> 00:39:28,475
I don't believe you.

380
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:31,480
I don't think Saraswati will
spend a penny without asking me.

381
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:35,077
And even the girl's family
is not so cheap...

382
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:37,483
... to put any kind
of burden on us.

383
00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:43,491
Go upstairs & see for yourself.
You'll know who is cheap.

384
00:39:43,695 --> 00:39:45,492
- Come.
- You stay here.

385
00:39:47,098 --> 00:39:48,497
I'll go and see for myself.

386
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:08,508
"Father, you? You should
have called me to your room."

387
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:15,115
I am saddened to see your
ways have changed...

388
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:17,523
... after your
visit to your in-laws.

389
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:20,529
I know youth is blind.

390
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:25,125
A woman can take advantage of it
and also ruin a home.

391
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:28,332
If this is your state
before marriage...

392
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:30,131
... what will happen
when she comes home?

393
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:33,139
"- You are mistaken, father.
- I am not blind."

394
00:40:33,544 --> 00:40:36,138
Aren't you
spending unnecessarily?

395
00:40:36,547 --> 00:40:39,539
Didn't you buy a ring of
Rs.5000 for your fiancee?

396
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,413
Didn't you make mother bequeath
her wealth to you...

397
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:43,349
... at your in-laws's behest?

398
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:46,546
"Father, atleast give me a
chance to explain myself."

399
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:48,557
Please stay quiet.

400
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,152
"You made a mistake. Moreover,
you are arguing with your father."

401
00:40:52,296 --> 00:40:53,558
Let him speak.

402
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:58,168
I want to see how brazen he
can get at his in-law's behest.

403
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:00,161
What will you explain?

404
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:03,099
Didn't you sink your
mother's money in loans?

405
00:41:03,508 --> 00:41:06,102
Didn't you make profits by
investing your money in shares?

406
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:09,503
Did you seek my opinion
while doing all this?

407
00:41:10,114 --> 00:41:11,513
"This is not right, Saraswati."

408
00:41:12,116 --> 00:41:15,108
You must understand a father
who loves his son so much.

409
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,512
I don't even
want to see his face!

410
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:29,531
I think I reprimanded Saraswati
a little too much.

411
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:33,527
Maybe that's why he
didn't come to have dinner.

412
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:36,538
- Shall I call him?
- Yes.

413
00:41:38,142 --> 00:41:40,133
I cannot eat without him.

414
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:43,537
"You eat,
I'll go and call him."

415
00:41:52,557 --> 00:41:54,149
Why didn't you
come to have dinner?

416
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:56,550
What are you punishing
your father for?

417
00:41:58,162 --> 00:41:59,561
"I'm not hungry, mother."

418
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:02,690
"You are not hungry, or you don't
want to eat your father's meals?"

419
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,091
"lf you are so egoistic,
then leave the house too."

420
00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:07,101
Even the house
belongs to your father.

421
00:42:20,117 --> 00:42:22,517
If this is your
state before marriage...

422
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,519
... what will happen when she
comes home as your bride?

423
00:42:25,523 --> 00:42:27,514
What are you punishing
your father for?

424
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,524
Let him speak.

425
00:42:30,127 --> 00:42:34,530
I want to see how brazen he can
get at his in-law's behest.

426
00:42:34,732 --> 00:42:36,723
"lf you are so egoistic,
leave the house too."

427
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:39,125
Even the house belongs
to your father.

428
00:42:39,537 --> 00:42:44,133
I'm not blind....I don't
even want to see his face!

429
00:42:47,545 --> 00:42:50,139
Father doesn't want
to see my face.

430
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:54,140
Mother wants me to leave home.

431
00:42:55,553 --> 00:43:00,149
It will be better if I leave
home to please them all.

432
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:07,089
I will have to
leave even Kumud.

433
00:43:34,525 --> 00:43:38,518
"At this hour?
What is the matter, Chander?"

434
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:48,129
"This is grandma's money,
and her property papers."

435
00:43:50,141 --> 00:43:53,133
Every penny of it is
for people's welfare.

436
00:43:53,544 --> 00:43:56,536
But what happened?
Please come clear.

437
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:01,482
What do I say?

438
00:44:04,088 --> 00:44:06,079
They were such sweet dreams.

439
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:14,088
"l and Kumud, our home,
our small world."

440
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,091
But there is nothing left now.

441
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:24,507
"It's not father's fault, mother
has instigated him against me."

442
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:33,109
"At her behest,the accusations he
levied on Kumud & her family..."

443
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:36,109
"... hearing those, I won't be
able to keep Kumud happy..."

444
00:44:36,253 --> 00:44:38,118
... in that house
after our marriage.

445
00:44:38,522 --> 00:44:45,121
Why? Stay separately
in the Walkeshwar bungalow.

446
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:51,124
"No, I cannot break father's
heart by getting separated."

447
00:44:51,535 --> 00:44:53,127
What are you planning to do?

448
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,132
I have already done
what I had to.

449
00:45:06,484 --> 00:45:09,476
I have written
to Kumud's father...

450
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:13,488
"... that I neither have
money now, nor a home."

451
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:18,087
"lf he likes, he can get Kumud
married into a family..."

452
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:22,088
... where she gets
love and respect.

453
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:25,498
What have you done!
You'll regret this.

454
00:45:25,603 --> 00:45:30,097
"You can get everything in
the world, but not such love."

455
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:37,103
"Yes Chandrakant,
I'd told you one day..."

456
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:39,514
... that I'm not
destined for love.

457
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:44,113
I'm not destined to get
love in my life.

458
00:45:47,124 --> 00:45:48,113
I'll be going.

459
00:45:50,127 --> 00:45:54,120
Where are you going? I won't let
you leave without a decision.

460
00:45:54,532 --> 00:45:58,127
Give a thought to Kumud.

461
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:01,061
"I'm telling you again,
you are being very hasty."

462
00:46:01,272 --> 00:46:03,467
How has Kumud harmed you?

463
00:46:03,674 --> 00:46:05,471
It is you who has
fought with his parents.

464
00:46:05,676 --> 00:46:07,473
Why are you punishing
Kumud for it?

465
00:46:07,678 --> 00:46:10,078
"I'd say, you board
a ship immediately."

466
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:13,079
Go and tell Kumud everything.

467
00:46:14,085 --> 00:46:18,488
"l am confident she loves you,
not your money."

468
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:22,482
What do I do?

469
00:46:24,095 --> 00:46:26,495
"Heed me,
nothing is lost yet."

470
00:46:27,098 --> 00:46:30,499
"Go to Kumud's house.
You'll go, won't you?"

471
00:46:31,102 --> 00:46:32,091
Sister-in-law.

472
00:46:44,515 --> 00:46:47,507
I've heard a letter has arrived.
What date have they fixed?

473
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,519
He's left home.

474
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:58,118
How could this happen!
Why did he do that?

475
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:03,066
There was a tiff in his home.
He hasn't written anything more.

476
00:47:04,068 --> 00:47:08,061
Go and check if he has
written anything more to Kumud.

477
00:47:38,102 --> 00:47:41,094
- Kumud!
- Mother.

478
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:44,506
"Don't cry, dear."

479
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:47,509
Your father will write to them
and get explanations.

480
00:47:48,112 --> 00:47:50,103
God will set everything alright.

481
00:47:50,514 --> 00:47:53,506
"No mother,
I have this scary feeling."

482
00:47:54,118 --> 00:47:57,110
I have a premonition something
untoward is going to happen.

483
00:47:58,122 --> 00:48:00,113
I'm sure something
untoward is going to happen.

484
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:57,513
"Whatever happened, neither
can you ever forget it, nor l."

485
00:48:58,115 --> 00:49:01,050
But we will have to suppress our
feelings and tolerate everything.

486
00:49:01,452 --> 00:49:04,046
Who knows where
I will be tomorrow.

487
00:49:05,055 --> 00:49:07,455
What will happen about my
ideal of serving people.

488
00:49:08,058 --> 00:49:13,052
"We will never meet again,
but hope never dies."

489
00:49:14,064 --> 00:49:17,465
"Now, my life is just a
memory of your true love."

490
00:49:18,068 --> 00:49:22,471
My only wish is that
you are always happy.

491
00:49:23,474 --> 00:49:25,465
"Your unfortunate, Chander."

492
00:49:34,084 --> 00:49:36,075
"Swarnapur's village chief,
Budhidhan..."

493
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,486
"... has sent a proposal
of his son, Pramadhan for Kumud."

494
00:49:41,091 --> 00:49:42,683
"lf we ignore such
a good proposal,..."

495
00:49:43,093 --> 00:49:45,084
... we won't get another
proposal again.

496
00:49:45,229 --> 00:49:48,096
Everyone will ask why the
girl's engagement broke.

497
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:51,496
Kusum's turn will come only
after we get Kumud married.

498
00:49:51,702 --> 00:49:56,105
It is good for Kumud
that she gets married soon.

499
00:49:56,307 --> 00:50:01,108
The poor girl doesn't eat
anything. She just cries all day.

500
00:50:02,112 --> 00:50:05,104
"Daughter-in-law,
what is your opinion?"

501
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:13,522
What do I say.
My daughter is heart broken.

502
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:18,526
When you cannot forget
Saraswati Chander...

503
00:50:19,129 --> 00:50:21,529
"... how can she,
she loved him."

504
00:50:22,132 --> 00:50:25,533
I am sending them
our consent.

505
00:50:26,136 --> 00:50:29,128
"No mother, I will not be
able to live without him."

506
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,543
"Rather than getting me married
to someone else, poison me."

507
00:50:35,145 --> 00:50:40,549
Do you know why ' courage'
is another name of women?

508
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:44,552
Only a woman can forget
her lover...

509
00:50:45,155 --> 00:50:48,556
... and worship her husband
that destiny sent for her.

510
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,560
"That is why, an lndian woman
is considered divine."

511
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:56,158
It is due to a woman's
sacrifice...

512
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,165
... that lndian culture
still survives.

513
00:50:59,169 --> 00:51:01,501
"And then, just think,..."

514
00:51:01,605 --> 00:51:04,506
... your adamance
will ruin Kusum's life.

515
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:09,102
"Until you are married,
we cannot get her married."

516
00:51:10,114 --> 00:51:11,103
Mother!

517
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:44,536
"Bless you, dear."

518
00:52:05,702 --> 00:52:12,505
"Keep your family honour, dear.
Be a devoted wife."

519
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,101
Consider your husband God.

520
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:23,108
Sister!

521
00:52:29,126 --> 00:52:34,530
"Don't cry, Kusum. Our
family happiness lies in this."

522
00:52:35,532 --> 00:52:39,525
- You fulfill their desire.
- Sister.

523
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:44,336
If ever you know
his whereabouts....

524
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:45,530
"Come, dear."

525
00:52:45,742 --> 00:52:52,545
"No one loved him,
everyone shunned him"

526
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:59,555
"There was only one
woman who loved him"

527
00:53:06,096 --> 00:53:09,088
"But look at his fate,
even that woman"

528
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,094
"Married someone else"

529
00:53:14,104 --> 00:53:20,100
"Like a caged bird,
she left perforce"

530
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:31,111
"And a lonely soul,
he kept wandering"

531
00:53:32,523 --> 00:53:38,519
"A child was born,
who was an ideal of sacrifice"

532
00:53:39,129 --> 00:53:42,121
"100 years ago"

533
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,101
Let me see this beautiful face.

534
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:41,107
You don't have
to feel shy with me.

535
00:55:46,123 --> 00:55:50,116
How fortunate I am.

536
00:55:51,128 --> 00:55:55,121
I had never thought even in my
dream that you'd be so beautiful.

537
00:55:57,134 --> 00:56:01,070
I'd heard that you were
engaged to someone else.

538
00:56:01,204 --> 00:56:02,466
But the engagement broke.

539
00:56:05,075 --> 00:56:08,476
Now I feel
how unfortunate he was.

540
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:13,481
- I am your slave.
- Not like that.

541
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:12,064
"l gave up everything I had"

542
00:57:12,275 --> 00:57:16,075
"To get your love"

543
00:57:29,493 --> 00:57:34,089
"Why did your love leave me"

544
00:57:40,504 --> 00:57:44,099
"To wander aimlessly"

545
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:49,510
"To get your love..."

546
00:58:19,476 --> 00:58:24,072
"The tears that
did not brim over"

547
00:58:24,481 --> 00:58:29,475
"The things that l
could not say"

548
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:49,495
"l hide them in my heart"

549
00:58:50,106 --> 00:58:54,099
"They will suffocate
and kill me one day"

550
00:58:55,512 --> 00:58:59,107
"To get your love..."

551
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:38,487
"May you belong to the
one you are married"

552
00:59:39,489 --> 00:59:44,085
"Best wishes for a
happy married life"

553
00:59:58,508 --> 01:00:03,502
"l am sitting on
a pyre of sorrow"

554
01:00:04,114 --> 01:00:08,517
"To burn alive"

555
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,521
"To get your love..."

556
01:01:11,114 --> 01:01:13,105
"Sister-in-law, let's sit there."

557
01:01:24,127 --> 01:01:27,528
"- Sister-in-law, look.
- What happened?"

558
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:31,123
A man is sleeping right
at the edge of the pond.

559
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:34,795
Why do you bother about
a stranger? Come back.

560
01:01:35,138 --> 01:01:38,130
"No sister-in-law, if he
turns, he'll be in the pond."

561
01:01:39,142 --> 01:01:41,542
"Alright, then go and wake him."

562
01:01:45,548 --> 01:01:46,537
Hey you!

563
01:01:50,153 --> 01:01:54,556
Careful!
Or you'll fall in the water.

564
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:04,498
Who is she?

565
01:02:05,502 --> 01:02:07,493
You seem to be new here.

566
01:02:08,505 --> 01:02:10,496
Haven't you heard
of chief Budhidhan?

567
01:02:11,107 --> 01:02:14,099
"She is his son's wife,
my sister-in-law, Kumud Sundari."

568
01:02:18,114 --> 01:02:22,517
"- Why, what happened?
- Nothing."

569
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,519
Navin Chander!

570
01:02:28,525 --> 01:02:31,517
"- Greetings, Chief.
- Where are you from?"

571
01:02:32,128 --> 01:02:33,527
Bombay.

572
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:35,529
What work brings you here?

573
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:38,122
Work?

574
01:02:41,538 --> 01:02:45,133
- I'm getting worldly wise.
- Are you educated?

575
01:02:46,543 --> 01:02:49,137
"I've learnt some English,
and some Sanskrit."

576
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:54,148
- Your name?
- Navin Chander.

577
01:02:55,151 --> 01:02:58,143
- What caste are you?
- Your caste.

578
01:02:58,555 --> 01:03:00,489
Why didn't you say that before?

579
01:03:01,491 --> 01:03:04,483
"From now on, you'll not stay in
the guest house, but our house."

580
01:03:04,694 --> 01:03:08,095
"You are generous,
but I desire to leave today."

581
01:03:08,231 --> 01:03:09,698
How is that possible?

582
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:13,092
"Priest, send his
luggage to our house."

583
01:03:13,236 --> 01:03:14,225
Alright.

584
01:03:21,111 --> 01:03:25,104
"God, no!
Don't test me so."

585
01:03:26,516 --> 01:03:28,507
I will not be
able to take it.

586
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,520
"The one who has
gone from my life,..."

587
01:03:32,622 --> 01:03:35,113
... has no right to
come back into my life.

588
01:03:42,532 --> 01:03:47,526
The food reminds me of the
feast we had in Kumud's house.

589
01:03:48,138 --> 01:03:51,539
And the tasty food has made you
forget to check...

590
01:03:51,641 --> 01:03:53,541
... if the guest
has eaten or not.

591
01:03:53,743 --> 01:03:56,143
"Kumud, get sweets."

592
01:04:01,084 --> 01:04:04,076
"No, thanks.
Even this is too much."

593
01:04:04,487 --> 01:04:07,479
Don't feel shy. You haven't
eaten anything. Take.

594
01:04:09,092 --> 01:04:10,081
Eat.

595
01:04:15,098 --> 01:04:18,499
Perhaps you didn't like the food
cooked by my daughter-in-law.

596
01:04:20,103 --> 01:04:23,095
"Navin Chander, are you married?"

597
01:04:24,107 --> 01:04:27,099
- No.
- You must surely be engaged.

598
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:31,512
His face gives me
a different picture.

599
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:33,514
"She is my daughter, Alak."

600
01:04:34,117 --> 01:04:36,517
Her mother's pampering
has spoilt her.

601
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,317
Your pampering has spoilt
our son even more.

602
01:04:40,523 --> 01:04:44,516
"Pramad, are you abashed
on meeting Navin Chander?"

603
01:04:44,761 --> 01:04:49,130
"He is so much younger to you,
yet he is so educated."

604
01:04:49,532 --> 01:04:53,127
You are not very much
interested in studying?

605
01:04:54,137 --> 01:04:56,537
I'm didn't study at all.

606
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,540
But I have compensated
for what he lacks.

607
01:05:00,143 --> 01:05:02,475
I have got him a
very educated wife.

608
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,072
You must have heard
of Divan Vidya Chatur.

609
01:05:07,483 --> 01:05:10,475
"She's his elder daughter, Kumud."

610
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:17,491
The priest was saying you have
some important work with me.

611
01:05:18,094 --> 01:05:20,494
"Yes son,
I have a lot to talk to you."

612
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:25,499
Sleep here tonight.

613
01:05:26,102 --> 01:05:28,502
Talk to me as late in
the night as you like.

614
01:05:29,105 --> 01:05:31,096
I don't mind leaving very late.

615
01:05:32,108 --> 01:05:37,512
Your talks make me
wish you were my son.

616
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:42,516
Or that my son was like you.

617
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:47,112
"There! Alka has come.
....Come, dear."

618
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:51,525
Navin Chander
will spend the night here.

619
01:05:52,128 --> 01:05:53,117
It's his own house.

620
01:06:00,136 --> 01:06:05,073
It is a known fact
that I am not educated.

621
01:06:06,075 --> 01:06:09,067
But I have become renowned
with my honesty and hard work.

622
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:14,743
"I'd hoped that my son, Pramad
would get an education..."

623
01:06:15,084 --> 01:06:16,073
... and support me.

624
01:06:16,486 --> 01:06:19,080
But my desire
could not be fulfilled.

625
01:06:23,092 --> 01:06:26,084
I will send
you my official papers.

626
01:06:27,096 --> 01:06:30,088
Go thought them
and give me your advise.

627
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,500
Has Pramad returned?

628
01:06:34,103 --> 01:06:36,503
"Yes, he had dinner
and went to sleep."

629
01:06:41,711 --> 01:06:47,513
"What do you see in others"

630
01:06:48,518 --> 01:06:53,114
"That you find lacking in me"

631
01:06:55,124 --> 01:07:01,063
"Despite having me"

632
01:07:02,065 --> 01:07:08,061
"You are interested
in other women"

633
01:07:12,075 --> 01:07:16,478
"You made promises to me, but
gave your heart to someone else"

634
01:07:22,085 --> 01:07:26,488
"You are very unfaithful,
my love"

635
01:07:31,094 --> 01:07:33,494
"You made promises..."

636
01:07:53,116 --> 01:07:58,110
"Where will you find the
heaven of my tresses"

637
01:07:58,321 --> 01:08:02,451
"Where will you find
my kind of looks"

638
01:08:08,064 --> 01:08:12,467
"You'll see,
you'll come back to me"

639
01:08:12,668 --> 01:08:17,071
"You won't find
my grace anywhere else"

640
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:28,483
"Without me,
nothing else will interest you"

641
01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:37,492
"You are very unfaithful..."

642
01:09:06,456 --> 01:09:11,450
"Where is the fervor of
that first look"

643
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:16,462
"Where are the promises
of being with me for life"

644
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:26,067
"You will lose steam"

645
01:09:26,476 --> 01:09:31,072
"Remember, if you change,
so will l"

646
01:09:36,686 --> 01:09:41,487
"Don't say then
that I took revenge"

647
01:09:46,496 --> 01:09:51,092
"You are very unfaithful..."

648
01:10:58,167 --> 01:11:01,102
I dozed off.
I'll warm the dinner.

649
01:11:01,237 --> 01:11:04,502
"It's very late,
I won't have dinner."

650
01:11:05,107 --> 01:11:08,508
"- Why? Have you eaten?
- No, I'm not hungry."

651
01:11:10,112 --> 01:11:13,513
Shatra was caught
in Padma's brothel.

652
01:11:14,317 --> 01:11:17,514
I'd to go to the police station
to get him released.

653
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,521
I never asked you
why you come home late.

654
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:27,118
"Kumud, you are not only
beautiful, but also intelligent."

655
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:30,530
You know my weakness.

656
01:11:31,534 --> 01:11:34,526
It is best that you
never question me about this.

657
01:11:43,145 --> 01:11:48,549
Help!
Father! Mother!

658
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:53,154
Listen! Get up! There are
noises coming from Alak's room.

659
01:11:54,156 --> 01:11:55,555
Alak! What happened?

660
01:12:08,504 --> 01:12:11,496
This window is open.
He must have got in from here.

661
01:12:17,513 --> 01:12:18,502
Be careful.

662
01:13:00,156 --> 01:13:01,487
You scoundrel!
Where are you trying to escape?

663
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,080
Catch him!
Don't let him go!

664
01:13:25,114 --> 01:13:27,105
What is it?
What do you want?

665
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:32,110
Do you want to ruin my reputation
in the eyes of my husband?

666
01:13:33,122 --> 01:13:35,522
"You are mistaken, Kumud."

667
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:39,117
Your duty is not
different from mine.

668
01:13:39,528 --> 01:13:42,520
- Oh my God!
- Don't touch me. Leave me!

669
01:13:43,132 --> 01:13:44,121
Go away!

670
01:13:49,138 --> 01:13:52,130
What's this?
Navin is injured!

671
01:13:52,341 --> 01:13:54,536
Mother! Father! Pramad!

672
01:14:15,097 --> 01:14:20,091
"Navin, are you in tremendous
pain?...Have this medicine."

673
01:14:24,106 --> 01:14:26,097
Pain is my medicine now.

674
01:14:26,509 --> 01:14:30,104
"Don't talk like that.
Get up, take your medicine."

675
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:45,116
I don't want to die.

676
01:14:46,128 --> 01:14:49,529
I don't want to die until
I have atoned for my sin.

677
01:14:54,136 --> 01:14:58,129
"Navin, get up,
take your medicine."

678
01:15:21,497 --> 01:15:25,490
"Sister, Alak!
I am like your brother."

679
01:15:27,102 --> 01:15:30,503
What have I done!
Please forgive me.

680
01:15:31,106 --> 01:15:35,099
I have disgraced myself!
How will I face the world now?

681
01:15:35,311 --> 01:15:38,508
"No sister,
I know your soul is clean."

682
01:15:39,114 --> 01:15:42,515
You are my true brother.
Please forgive me.

683
01:15:43,118 --> 01:15:45,109
"Remove that guilt
from your mind, sister."

684
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:47,520
Give me medicine.

685
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:58,122
- The guest is enjoying himself.
- Why? What happened?

686
01:15:58,534 --> 01:16:02,470
Alak and the guest are
having a lovely time together.

687
01:16:03,472 --> 01:16:05,064
But it's right too.

688
01:16:06,075 --> 01:16:11,479
What's wrong in surrendering your
honor to the one who saved it?

689
01:16:13,082 --> 01:16:16,074
Don't you dare talk
cheap about the guest!

690
01:16:20,089 --> 01:16:24,082
"Alak, how is the guest now?"

691
01:16:24,693 --> 01:16:26,285
"You are too much, sister-in-law."

692
01:16:26,362 --> 01:16:29,490
A good man was almost dying
in your house...

693
01:16:29,598 --> 01:16:31,498
... and you did
not even look him up.

694
01:16:32,101 --> 01:16:34,501
Like as if you have
an old enmity with him.

695
01:16:36,105 --> 01:16:37,504
You are stone hearted.

696
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:43,507
"Keep me as your slave"

697
01:16:44,113 --> 01:16:45,512
Why are you singing my song?

698
01:16:46,115 --> 01:16:49,107
You have become a
little out of tune nowadays.

699
01:16:49,518 --> 01:16:53,113
"Go to your wife,
she's very much in tune."

700
01:16:54,123 --> 01:16:55,522
Damn my wife...

701
01:16:59,128 --> 01:17:00,459
Keep this.

702
01:17:05,067 --> 01:17:07,467
I was asking her where you are.

703
01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:12,472
A letter has come for you
from your parent's home.

704
01:17:16,078 --> 01:17:20,071
I am very tired.
I even have a headache.

705
01:17:22,084 --> 01:17:26,077
"lf you could bring me hot milk,
it would be nice."

706
01:17:31,093 --> 01:17:32,492
Take your letter.

707
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:29,482
Let me go...Iet me go.
I'll scream.

708
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:31,074
Let me go.

709
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:35,079
- Leave me.
- No... - No!

710
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:42,086
I'll scream!
Let me go.

711
01:19:05,054 --> 01:19:07,045
- Where are you going?
- Let me go!

712
01:19:07,456 --> 01:19:09,048
You think I'm a lose woman?

713
01:19:09,258 --> 01:19:12,056
"I'm not Padma,
I'm a respectable woman."

714
01:19:12,461 --> 01:19:14,053
Respectable indeed!

715
01:19:24,073 --> 01:19:26,473
Leave me!
I'm feeling ticklish.

716
01:19:33,482 --> 01:19:35,473
Quiet!
Go..from there!

717
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:39,079
Why from there?
I'll go from here.

718
01:19:40,089 --> 01:19:41,078
But...

719
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:52,490
Why are you holding me?
Keep your husband in check.

720
01:19:53,102 --> 01:19:56,094
Atleast he returns home at
night because of me.

721
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:58,496
Or he would
disgrace his family name...

722
01:19:58,607 --> 01:20:01,098
... by staying the night
at Padma's brothel.

723
01:20:08,517 --> 01:20:12,510
The milk fell down?
Doesn't matter.

724
01:20:13,122 --> 01:20:14,521
Did you read your letter?

725
01:20:15,124 --> 01:20:19,117
I think you should visit
your mother for a few days.

726
01:20:19,528 --> 01:20:22,520
It will be good for you.
You don't keep well.

727
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:33,531
I forgot to give you this
necklace because of that letter.

728
01:20:34,143 --> 01:20:36,543
I've bought it for you.
Like it?

729
01:20:36,645 --> 01:20:38,340
"Come, I'll wear
it for you myself."

730
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:43,143
-Have mercy on me!
-Why are you dirtying my clothes?

731
01:20:43,552 --> 01:20:46,544
- I have to go out.
- Don't leave me and go.

732
01:20:47,156 --> 01:20:49,147
Please don't
leave me alone and go.

733
01:20:57,166 --> 01:20:59,157
"What have you done, Saraswati?"

734
01:21:01,103 --> 01:21:04,095
You handed over an innocent
girl to a brute.

735
01:21:04,506 --> 01:21:06,497
All this has
happened because of you.

736
01:21:07,509 --> 01:21:10,103
How will you
atone for this now?

737
01:21:11,113 --> 01:21:15,106
How will you
leave her here to suffer?

738
01:21:16,118 --> 01:21:20,521
"No, the fire in which you
have left Kumud to burn..."

739
01:21:20,722 --> 01:21:23,623
... you will have to
burn in it for life.

740
01:21:52,154 --> 01:21:57,558
Forgive me if you can.
I only have ruined your life.

741
01:22:00,162 --> 01:22:01,493
Shall I speak to Pramad?

742
01:22:02,097 --> 01:22:04,088
Why are you
interfering in our life?

743
01:22:04,499 --> 01:22:06,490
There is no need
to show me sympathy.

744
01:22:07,102 --> 01:22:08,501
I am very happy.

745
01:22:20,515 --> 01:22:23,507
"Come down, everyone is
waiting for you at the dance."

746
01:22:26,521 --> 01:22:29,513
"- Excuse me, sister.
- Who all do I excuse?"

747
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:35,529
Even Navin was making excuses. I
finally convinced him to join us.

748
01:22:35,731 --> 01:22:39,531
"Now you are making excuses.
Alright, I'll excuse you."

749
01:22:40,135 --> 01:22:41,534
But if the daughter-in-law
of the family...

750
01:22:41,637 --> 01:22:44,538
"... herself doesn't join in the
dance, what will the guests say?"

751
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,540
Change and come down.
We are leaving.

752
01:23:13,101 --> 01:23:17,094
"l am forgetting
my parent's home"

753
01:23:17,306 --> 01:23:20,503
"l love it here
in my husband's home"

754
01:23:27,516 --> 01:23:31,509
"Someone send a
message to my parents"

755
01:23:36,525 --> 01:23:39,517
"l love it here in
my husband's home..."

756
01:24:06,488 --> 01:24:11,084
"My sister-in-law
is like a sister to me"

757
01:24:16,098 --> 01:24:20,501
"My mother-in-law is
the epitome of love"

758
01:24:27,509 --> 01:24:29,101
"Like a father..."

759
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:36,516
"... is my father-in-law"

760
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:40,520
"l love it here in
my husband's home..."

761
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:20,086
"The moon is beautiful,
and so is the sun"

762
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:29,503
"But my husband is the best!"

763
01:25:36,511 --> 01:25:38,502
"Only the eyes understand..."

764
01:25:43,118 --> 01:25:45,313
"... what's in my heart"

765
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,512
"l love it here in
my husband's home..."

766
01:26:21,089 --> 01:26:25,492
"My husband sits
gazing in my eyes"

767
01:26:31,099 --> 01:26:35,502
"He doesn't leave me alone
even for a moment"

768
01:26:42,511 --> 01:26:44,502
"l have..."

769
01:26:48,517 --> 01:26:50,508
"... no complains"

770
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:54,520
"l love it here in
my husband's home..."

771
01:29:50,498 --> 01:29:54,491
"Daughter, this family's
honour is in your hands."

772
01:29:55,103 --> 01:29:57,094
- Your husband is your God.
- Mother!

773
01:30:00,108 --> 01:30:03,100
God! What was I doing!

774
01:30:04,112 --> 01:30:08,105
God! What was I doing!

775
01:30:14,522 --> 01:30:20,119
"O Goddess Amba, you only came as
my mother and saved me."

776
01:30:21,129 --> 01:30:23,529
Pardon me this sin.

777
01:30:25,133 --> 01:30:28,125
What do I do for
Saraswati's happiness?

778
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:31,128
"What do I do, Mother?"

779
01:31:47,148 --> 01:31:48,137
"Get up, Kumud."

780
01:32:01,095 --> 01:32:02,494
"Why did you come here, Kumud?"

781
01:32:03,097 --> 01:32:06,089
What state would you be in
if anyone had seen you here?

782
01:32:07,502 --> 01:32:10,494
What worse state
can I come in now?

783
01:32:10,705 --> 01:32:14,505
"The one who was educated,
left me before marriage."

784
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:20,103
"The one who is illiterate,
left me after marriage."

785
01:32:20,515 --> 01:32:24,110
"No Kumud, you are accusing me."

786
01:32:25,119 --> 01:32:27,519
- l... - I don't want
to hear or say anything.

787
01:32:29,123 --> 01:32:32,524
I'd only come to tell you
to go away from here.

788
01:32:33,528 --> 01:32:38,124
"lf you don't want to go to
Bombay, go to my father's place."

789
01:32:39,534 --> 01:32:41,126
But it's my request.

790
01:32:42,136 --> 01:32:44,536
Don't do to any other woman
what you did to me.

791
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:47,539
I have tolerated it.

792
01:32:48,543 --> 01:32:53,139
But even the strongest of
hearts could have been shattered.

793
01:33:00,774 --> 01:33:05,768
"Kumud, my staying here is
adding to your problems."

794
01:33:05,979 --> 01:33:08,379
So that you are not hurt
more because of me...

795
01:33:08,515 --> 01:33:09,777
... I am leaving.

796
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:58,824
"' Dear sir, please pardon me,
but I am leaving."

797
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:01,358
' If I knew where
I was going...'

798
01:35:01,495 --> 01:35:05,761
'... I would surely tell you.
But please don't worry about me'

799
01:35:06,366 --> 01:35:09,767
' May God bless your family
with peace and happiness'

800
01:35:10,370 --> 01:35:11,769
"'Yours, Navin Chander"'

801
01:35:13,373 --> 01:35:17,366
What happened that
he left so suddenly?

802
01:35:18,378 --> 01:35:21,779
"Kumud, you were in
the adjoining room."

803
01:35:22,382 --> 01:35:26,375
Didn't you also hear anything?
Didn't you realise either?

804
01:35:26,587 --> 01:35:28,578
He has acted very immature.

805
01:35:29,389 --> 01:35:34,793
Times are bad. Bandits are
looting people in broad daylight.

806
01:35:35,395 --> 01:35:38,387
- Do you recognise me?
- No.

807
01:35:38,532 --> 01:35:43,401
You don't recognise your saviour?
He saved your life once.

808
01:35:43,537 --> 01:35:47,803
"l do recognise my saviour,
but not you."

809
01:35:48,408 --> 01:35:49,807
When did you save my life?

810
01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:53,411
You were drowning in
the pond in Badreshwar.

811
01:35:53,547 --> 01:35:55,811
That's when I'd saved you.

812
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:58,816
I've never been to Badreshwar
in my life.

813
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:01,012
Then you must have
been to Ankleshwar.

814
01:36:01,355 --> 01:36:06,349
- Not even in my dreams.
- Then you'll see it now.

815
01:36:18,372 --> 01:36:19,361
Bandits!

816
01:36:30,784 --> 01:36:33,776
You rascal!
You are leaving me alone!

817
01:36:35,389 --> 01:36:37,789
"Look brother,
the rascal has left me alone."

818
01:36:37,891 --> 01:36:40,382
He has?
Give me your ornaments.

819
01:36:40,527 --> 01:36:43,792
"- I won't!
- I said, remove your ornaments!"

820
01:36:43,897 --> 01:36:45,797
"Get lost, rascal!
Leave me!"

821
01:36:58,812 --> 01:36:59,801
Take the cart and go!

822
01:37:08,355 --> 01:37:09,344
Let's go.

823
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:45,781
"O God of Death,
I don't want to die..."

824
01:37:45,892 --> 01:37:48,793
... carrying the burden of sin
of ruining Kumud's life.

825
01:37:49,396 --> 01:37:52,058
Let me atone for my sin.

826
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:54,799
"Thereafter, I won't mind dying."

827
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:21,759
"What is the matter, Mohan Puri?"

828
01:38:22,763 --> 01:38:26,756
"Gurudev, a man is lying here. I
don't know if he's dead or alive."

829
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:34,373
Pick him up.
This is an auspicious moment.

830
01:38:34,775 --> 01:38:38,370
He is definitely a divine soul.
Take him to our hermitage.

831
01:38:38,512 --> 01:38:39,774
"As you wish, Gurudev."

832
01:38:46,386 --> 01:38:47,785
I lost my heart to someone.

833
01:38:52,793 --> 01:38:56,388
- Angry?
- Leave me!

834
01:38:56,997 --> 01:38:58,396
You are late again.

835
01:38:58,799 --> 01:39:01,324
"Don't break my heart, darling."

836
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:02,730
But what could I do?

837
01:39:03,336 --> 01:39:06,737
"Because of that chaste woman,
I'm tied to the house."

838
01:39:08,341 --> 01:39:11,333
I just cannot come
and have fun with you.

839
01:39:14,347 --> 01:39:20,752
"Or tell me, have I ever
gone anywhere without you?"

840
01:39:23,356 --> 01:39:25,756
Then why don't you send your
wife to her parents's home?

841
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:27,759
She just refuses to go.

842
01:39:28,361 --> 01:39:32,354
I'll offer sweets of Rs.5 to
the Goddess if she leaves.

843
01:39:33,366 --> 01:39:36,358
Why of Rs.5?
Offer sweets of only Rs.2.50.

844
01:39:37,771 --> 01:39:39,363
She will hear your
prayers right away!

845
01:39:42,375 --> 01:39:45,367
"Take, Navin's love letter."

846
01:39:46,379 --> 01:39:53,376
He wrote a love letter to you?
I'll kill him if he eyes you!

847
01:40:01,328 --> 01:40:07,733
- In Kumud's name?!
- Yes. What will you do now?

848
01:40:27,354 --> 01:40:32,348
Why are you doing this?
I am a sinner.

849
01:40:32,492 --> 01:40:33,959
Why do you add to my sins?

850
01:40:34,361 --> 01:40:37,353
"And then, I am not your God."

851
01:40:38,365 --> 01:40:42,028
- Your God has left.
- What are you talking!

852
01:40:42,369 --> 01:40:45,361
"Oh yes, why will you understand
what I am saying?"

853
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:48,364
"l am an uneducated,
illiterate bumb."

854
01:40:48,508 --> 01:40:50,772
But you are educated!

855
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:55,781
But I'm not a bad man.

856
01:40:55,982 --> 01:40:58,780
I'll arrange for your departure
to your parents' home tomorrow.

857
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:02,321
You will find another God
for yourself on the way.

858
01:41:03,323 --> 01:41:06,724
There is no dearth of Gods. The
devotee should be devoted enough.

859
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:11,729
Has someone instigated
you against me?

860
01:41:12,332 --> 01:41:13,731
Why don't you come clear?

861
01:41:13,833 --> 01:41:17,325
Because I cannot read clearly.
I'm illiterate after all.

862
01:41:17,537 --> 01:41:19,334
"Take, read it yourself."

863
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:25,734
"lf you meet the same God
on your way, give it to him."

864
01:41:27,347 --> 01:41:33,752
"Forgive me, but I have not
cheated you in any way."

865
01:41:34,354 --> 01:41:36,345
Allow me to stay at your feet.

866
01:41:37,357 --> 01:41:39,757
My life will be worthwhile
only in serving you.

867
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:43,354
"Acting to be a chaste woman, eh?"

868
01:41:43,763 --> 01:41:47,028
You are not worthy of being
this family's daughter-in-law.

869
01:41:47,367 --> 01:41:48,766
You are more cheap than Padma.

870
01:41:49,369 --> 01:41:51,030
Just leave this house
without a word...

871
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:53,362
... if you want to save your
family and your honour.

872
01:41:53,773 --> 01:41:55,764
Or I'll show this
letter to everyone.

873
01:41:55,875 --> 01:41:58,776
"No, please don't do that,
I plead with you."

874
01:42:02,315 --> 01:42:07,309
"lf you cannot permit me to live
with you, chop off my head."

875
01:42:07,721 --> 01:42:09,313
I'll consider myself fortunate.

876
01:42:09,723 --> 01:42:11,714
"What's the matter?
What happened, brother?"

877
01:42:13,326 --> 01:42:16,727
What do I say? You know
mom is not keeping well.

878
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:18,991
I told her not to visit
her parent's home now.

879
01:42:19,332 --> 01:42:20,731
That she can visit them later.

880
01:42:21,334 --> 01:42:22,995
She says she'll behead herself.

881
01:42:23,336 --> 01:42:26,328
"Alright, go.
But don't behead yourself."

882
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:31,734
"Kalika, pack her bags.
She'll visit her parents."

883
01:42:32,345 --> 01:42:35,746
"Alak, ask father to
arrange for a vehicle."

884
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:38,741
Are you happy now?

885
01:42:38,852 --> 01:42:40,754
This cannot be true.
I'm sure it's something else.

886
01:42:40,754 --> 01:42:42,745
"lf you don't believe me,
ask her yourself."

887
01:42:44,357 --> 01:42:47,349
"Come on, tell her,
if it's something else."

888
01:42:48,361 --> 01:42:49,350
Ask her.

889
01:43:21,394 --> 01:43:24,386
"' Dear, Kumud, sending you to
visit your parents..."

890
01:43:24,531 --> 01:43:29,400
'... is just an excuse. He wants
that you leave him forever.'

891
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,401
'That you never return'

892
01:43:33,406 --> 01:43:37,399
' I don't know what will happen
when your mother hears this'

893
01:43:47,821 --> 01:43:49,413
Stop the chariot!

894
01:44:03,369 --> 01:44:05,360
"- Grandfather, you?
- How are you, dear?"

895
01:44:05,772 --> 01:44:08,366
"The journey was risky,
so I brought some men along."

896
01:44:08,508 --> 01:44:12,774
- Are you alright?
- How is everyone at home?

897
01:44:12,879 --> 01:44:15,780
They are all desperate
to know how you are.

898
01:44:16,382 --> 01:44:18,373
"Come, let us take rest here."

899
01:44:57,423 --> 01:44:59,823
"'Acting a very
chaste woman, eh?"'

900
01:45:00,426 --> 01:45:03,759
' You are not worthy of being the
daughter-in-law of this family'

901
01:45:03,863 --> 01:45:05,558
' You are more
cheap than Padma!'

902
01:45:06,366 --> 01:45:09,767
' Leave without a word if you want
to save your family & your honor'

903
01:45:26,986 --> 01:45:28,385
I don't think l
will survive now.

904
01:45:29,389 --> 01:45:30,788
I won't.

905
01:45:31,391 --> 01:45:38,388
"Alak, who will look after my
baby in Kumud absence?"

906
01:45:38,598 --> 01:45:40,793
"Don't talk like that, mother."

907
01:45:41,401 --> 01:45:44,996
Call Pramad. I'll ask him to
bring Kumud home.

908
01:45:46,406 --> 01:45:50,399
I'll be able to die in peace
only after she comes home.

909
01:45:52,412 --> 01:45:56,075
Rs.50 is for Kumud.
Rs.10 for perfume.

910
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:59,817
I spend the rest.
That leave only Rs.25.

911
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:01,546
Which I give you.

912
01:46:01,754 --> 01:46:04,746
You bitch! How dare you sit
on my sister-in-law's bed!

913
01:46:04,958 --> 01:46:06,949
"Why are you telling me,
tell your brother."

914
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,351
You cheap woman!
How dare you!

915
01:46:09,495 --> 01:46:10,757
"Alak, what are you doing!"

916
01:46:12,365 --> 01:46:14,356
What are you doing!
It's not her fault.

917
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:16,559
Not her fault?
Ask me!

918
01:46:16,769 --> 01:46:18,760
"Alak, you don't know,
but it's this bitch..."

919
01:46:18,871 --> 01:46:20,566
... who trapped
your brother...

920
01:46:20,773 --> 01:46:22,365
... and got Kumud
thrown out of the house.

921
01:46:22,508 --> 01:46:24,772
"Because of these two,
Kumud may never return."

922
01:46:24,877 --> 01:46:25,866
You stay out of this!

923
01:46:26,779 --> 01:46:28,371
Leave me.
What are you doing!

924
01:46:30,383 --> 01:46:33,784
What happened?
What is the noise about?

925
01:46:33,886 --> 01:46:36,787
I will never make this
mistake again. Forgive me.

926
01:46:39,792 --> 01:46:41,987
"Mother, this two
pittance of a woman..."

927
01:46:42,395 --> 01:46:44,386
... she and brother have
together thrown Kumud out.

928
01:46:44,530 --> 01:46:47,397
This woman was
sleeping on brother's bed.

929
01:46:49,402 --> 01:46:50,801
I'll kill you!

930
01:46:51,404 --> 01:46:54,805
What trick did you play to get
Kumud thrown out of the house?

931
01:46:54,907 --> 01:46:56,602
"- Why don't you speak?
- Wait, Alak!"

932
01:46:57,410 --> 01:46:59,401
"Mother, she did not do anything."

933
01:46:59,812 --> 01:47:01,336
Kumud herself ran
away from home.

934
01:47:02,348 --> 01:47:04,009
"She's not a good woman, mother."

935
01:47:04,350 --> 01:47:07,751
See! See these letters
of Navin Chander...

936
01:47:08,354 --> 01:47:10,345
... which he wrote to your
brazen daughter-in-law.

937
01:47:10,556 --> 01:47:14,754
Don't you dare say anything
cheap about my Kumud.

938
01:47:15,361 --> 01:47:19,354
"You are not my son, but some sin
I committed in my previous life."

939
01:47:19,565 --> 01:47:21,760
Get out of my sight!

940
01:47:22,368 --> 01:47:24,632
I don't want the shadow of a
debauch man like you...

941
01:47:24,771 --> 01:47:26,363
... to fall on my younger son!

942
01:47:26,572 --> 01:47:29,370
"Alright mother,
I'm leaving."

943
01:47:30,977 --> 01:47:32,968
I myself don't want to
live in this house.

944
01:47:35,381 --> 01:47:37,781
Where are you going after
disgracing the family?

945
01:47:40,586 --> 01:47:43,384
I will not let you play
with the family honour anymore.

946
01:47:43,589 --> 01:47:46,786
I will lock you up
and allow you to rot to death.

947
01:47:47,393 --> 01:47:48,382
You shameless fellow!

948
01:47:50,396 --> 01:47:51,385
Get out!

949
01:47:52,398 --> 01:47:57,802
"I'll die, but never come
to this house again!"

950
01:47:58,404 --> 01:48:00,395
You heard that?
I'll kill myself!

951
01:48:00,473 --> 01:48:06,343
- Get out of my house!
- I'll kill myself.

952
01:48:30,770 --> 01:48:35,764
"Look! Someone is floating.
Go, get her out."

953
01:49:14,347 --> 01:49:16,338
My life is
nothing but darkness...

954
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:19,750
... that suffocates
my conscience.

955
01:49:21,354 --> 01:49:25,347
"Mother Chandravali, why did you
save this unfortunate woman?"

956
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,351
One must never give up hope.

957
01:49:29,762 --> 01:49:33,755
Consider the river you came
floating in as heaven's door.

958
01:49:35,368 --> 01:49:38,360
Now this holy place
is your heaven.

959
01:50:03,329 --> 01:50:06,321
Is he the same great man
who gave up the world...

960
01:50:06,466 --> 01:50:08,331
... for the sake of your love?

961
01:50:11,337 --> 01:50:15,740
Maybe God wants you two to meet.

962
01:50:16,342 --> 01:50:21,336
"Kumud, Saraswati became
an ascetic for your sake."

963
01:50:21,747 --> 01:50:24,341
He can come back
only for your sake.

964
01:50:25,351 --> 01:50:29,754
It is now your duty to bring
him back into worldly life.

965
01:50:30,356 --> 01:50:37,353
"What are you saying, mother!
You know I am married."

966
01:50:38,364 --> 01:50:41,356
How can I even
think of doing that?

967
01:50:41,767 --> 01:50:43,359
"You are mistaken, dear."

968
01:50:43,769 --> 01:50:47,364
"Your real husband is not Pramad,
but Saraswati."

969
01:50:47,507 --> 01:50:48,496
"Mother, no!"

970
01:51:00,386 --> 01:51:02,718
"This is a sin, a crime,
unlawful, Mother!"

971
01:51:04,323 --> 01:51:06,723
I has asked Saraswati
to leave my house.

972
01:51:08,327 --> 01:51:10,727
Not to become an ascetic.

973
01:51:11,330 --> 01:51:14,731
"Give him the sense to
return from this place, Mother!"

974
01:51:14,834 --> 01:51:18,326
Give him happiness.
Take my life in return.

975
01:51:19,338 --> 01:51:20,737
But please save him.

976
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:23,340
- Kumud.
- Mother.

977
01:51:27,747 --> 01:51:29,339
"Calm your mind, dear."

978
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:35,343
Saraswati's sorrow has
taken my peace of mind.

979
01:51:36,355 --> 01:51:39,756
"l can neither live, nor die."

980
01:51:40,359 --> 01:51:41,758
Life is meant to live.

981
01:51:42,361 --> 01:51:45,353
And you have the added
responsibility of such a man...

982
01:51:45,565 --> 01:51:48,363
... who has to do good
for millions of people.

983
01:51:49,368 --> 01:51:51,768
"What can I do, mother?"

984
01:51:52,371 --> 01:51:54,362
He is getting deeper
into ascetic life.

985
01:51:54,574 --> 01:51:58,772
How can I save him?
What do I do?

986
01:51:59,378 --> 01:52:02,313
The fire of separation
burning in a man's heart...

987
01:52:03,316 --> 01:52:05,307
... cannot be
doused with advise.

988
01:52:05,718 --> 01:52:11,315
"Only, love, kindness,
affection, can cool it."

989
01:52:12,325 --> 01:52:15,317
Only you can
convince Saraswati Chander.

990
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:18,319
Me?

991
01:52:23,336 --> 01:52:25,736
"Sage, please forgive me."

992
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:30,741
"Some time ago, at the steps,
with Mother Chandravali..."

993
01:52:32,345 --> 01:52:36,748
"No, I am sure she
was not Kumud."

994
01:52:36,849 --> 01:52:41,752
"- She was Kumud.
- Kumud, and here?"

995
01:52:42,355 --> 01:52:44,346
But she was with her in-laws.

996
01:52:44,490 --> 01:52:49,359
"After you left, her husband
accused her of being immoral."

997
01:52:50,363 --> 01:52:53,764
He broke ties with her
and threw her out of the house.

998
01:52:54,767 --> 01:52:57,759
Such a big injustice was
done to that good woman?

999
01:52:59,372 --> 01:53:02,773
Has she come here to
lead an ascetic life?

1000
01:53:03,376 --> 01:53:05,776
Her heart had turned ascetic
the very day...

1001
01:53:06,379 --> 01:53:09,371
... she was married off
to someone else.

1002
01:53:10,383 --> 01:53:13,375
And when she jumped into the
river to kill herself...

1003
01:53:13,786 --> 01:53:16,380
... Mother Chandravali
saved her.

1004
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:20,791
I am responsible
for all her sorrows.

1005
01:53:21,394 --> 01:53:24,795
Gather yourself and hear this.

1006
01:53:25,798 --> 01:53:29,393
Fate has dealt her another blow.

1007
01:53:30,403 --> 01:53:32,803
Her mother-in-law
and husband have died.

1008
01:53:33,806 --> 01:53:39,403
Husband?
What are you saying!

1009
01:53:39,812 --> 01:53:44,408
And you only will have to
break this bad news to her.

1010
01:53:46,819 --> 01:53:47,808
Me?

1011
01:53:49,422 --> 01:53:51,822
Even Kumud wants
to tell you something.

1012
01:53:52,425 --> 01:53:56,418
Wait for her in the holy
cave of Chiranjeev Singh.

1013
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:59,830
Chandrakant has brought
us very good news.

1014
01:54:00,433 --> 01:54:01,764
Saraswati has been traced.

1015
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:04,962
"- How are you, Chandrakant?
- I'm fine."

1016
01:54:05,371 --> 01:54:08,772
He's living in the hermitage of
Vishnu Baba in Sundergiri hills.

1017
01:54:09,375 --> 01:54:12,572
- I'm going there today itself.
- Even I am going with him.

1018
01:54:12,778 --> 01:54:15,770
It will be so much fun.
It will be a change.

1019
01:54:16,382 --> 01:54:18,373
Why don't we all go?

1020
01:54:18,784 --> 01:54:24,780
We cannot go. Serve refreshments
to Chandrakant. He must be tired.

1021
01:54:28,394 --> 01:54:31,386
You are hiding something
from me. What is the matter?

1022
01:54:31,530 --> 01:54:32,792
Tell me please!

1023
01:54:36,402 --> 01:54:40,805
Saraswati is not alone.
Even Kumud is with him.

1024
01:54:47,413 --> 01:54:49,404
Kumud is with Saraswati!!

1025
01:54:49,815 --> 01:54:53,410
Have courage.

1026
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:56,820
I cannot be as
courageous as you.

1027
01:54:57,823 --> 01:55:01,759
Your daughter is with another
man & you are so calm about it?

1028
01:55:05,364 --> 01:55:08,356
The shameless girl has
brought disgrace to our family.

1029
01:55:09,368 --> 01:55:10,767
Why doesn't she die!

1030
01:55:11,370 --> 01:55:14,771
Why wasn't she born dead!

1031
01:55:15,374 --> 01:55:19,777
How will we face the world?
What do we do about it now?

1032
01:55:20,379 --> 01:55:24,782
"There is only one solution,
that you keep your mouth shut!"

1033
01:55:25,384 --> 01:55:27,375
Why do you have to
tell the whole world?

1034
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:29,044
I am not telling
the whole world.

1035
01:55:29,388 --> 01:55:31,788
I am only saying that we should
sit together and discuss this.

1036
01:55:32,391 --> 01:55:36,384
You people ruined her life
with your advises.

1037
01:55:36,796 --> 01:55:38,787
Let her be happy now.

1038
01:55:39,398 --> 01:55:40,797
She loved Saraswati.

1039
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:43,800
You'll forced her
to marry Pramad.

1040
01:55:43,903 --> 01:55:45,996
You'll didn't
wait for Saraswati.

1041
01:55:46,405 --> 01:55:52,401
"She wept, she pleaded, but you
all crushed her desires forever."

1042
01:55:52,812 --> 01:55:56,407
"For the sake of your happiness,
she tolerated your atrocity."

1043
01:55:56,816 --> 01:55:59,808
But you cannot tolerate
her happiness. I ask why?

1044
01:56:00,019 --> 01:56:01,748
"Today, when her
husband is dead,..."

1045
01:56:01,854 --> 01:56:03,754
... you will have to
quietly tolerate everything.

1046
01:56:04,356 --> 01:56:07,757
Keeping quiet will not
make what is wrong turn right.

1047
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:09,759
So what if her husband is dead?

1048
01:56:09,862 --> 01:56:12,763
Kumud cannot forget
that she is now a widow.

1049
01:56:13,365 --> 01:56:18,359
I want to go to her and
remind her of her duty.

1050
01:56:18,571 --> 01:56:22,371
What duty will
you remind her of?

1051
01:56:23,375 --> 01:56:26,776
If widow remarriage
was wrong...

1052
01:56:27,379 --> 01:56:30,780
"... then Lord Ram,
after killing Ravan..."

1053
01:56:30,883 --> 01:56:34,375
...would have never have got
Mandodari married to Vibhishan.

1054
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:38,786
"Forget all that,
but what about society?"

1055
01:56:39,391 --> 01:56:42,383
"Do you know,
you will lose your job."

1056
01:56:42,561 --> 01:56:44,392
You will not be able to
move out of the house.

1057
01:56:44,797 --> 01:56:46,788
We will be ostracized.

1058
01:56:47,399 --> 01:56:52,803
"lf losing my money,
wealth, honour..."

1059
01:56:53,405 --> 01:56:55,396
... can bring my daughter
some happiness...

1060
01:56:56,408 --> 01:56:58,399
... I am prepared for it.

1061
01:57:08,354 --> 01:57:10,345
It took you so long to speak.

1062
01:57:11,357 --> 01:57:14,349
I thought you had
a lot to say to me.

1063
01:57:15,361 --> 01:57:17,352
Even you
wanted to say something.

1064
01:57:18,364 --> 01:57:20,355
"I'll first listen,
then speak."

1065
01:57:22,368 --> 01:57:25,360
"Besides, now the time is not
passing soon like before."

1066
01:57:26,772 --> 01:57:29,366
"Saying, listening,
everything will be done."

1067
01:57:32,778 --> 01:57:35,372
Looks like you haven't seen
the mirror since many days.

1068
01:57:36,382 --> 01:57:39,374
Wonder which previous life's
enmity you have with yourself.

1069
01:57:40,386 --> 01:57:43,378
"Who knows about previous
or next life, Kumud?"

1070
01:57:44,390 --> 01:57:47,382
We have to pay for our
deeds in this life itself.

1071
01:57:48,394 --> 01:57:50,385
Then live this
life in happiness.

1072
01:57:52,798 --> 01:57:53,787
In happiness?

1073
01:57:56,402 --> 01:58:00,395
Oh!
I forgot about the fruits.

1074
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:02,329
"Take, eat."

1075
01:58:12,351 --> 01:58:13,750
What happened?

1076
01:58:16,355 --> 01:58:17,754
What is left to happen now?

1077
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:25,353
Fate made us meet
everywhere else.

1078
01:58:26,365 --> 01:58:30,768
But didn't make us meet when
we wouldn't have got separated.

1079
01:58:33,772 --> 01:58:36,764
Wonder what sin I'd committed.

1080
01:58:38,377 --> 01:58:40,777
Won't you tell me?

1081
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:45,783
"Kumud, after leaving home,
I was coming to meet you."

1082
01:58:48,387 --> 01:58:50,787
But my boat was
trapped in a storm.

1083
01:58:51,790 --> 01:58:54,782
And I was so late
in reaching you...

1084
01:58:55,394 --> 01:58:57,385
... that I lost you forever.

1085
01:58:58,797 --> 01:59:03,734
I felt then that the
cruel hands of fate...

1086
01:59:04,336 --> 01:59:05,735
... had ripped
one soul into two.

1087
01:59:06,739 --> 01:59:11,733
You never wrote or told me that
you could not reach in time.

1088
01:59:12,344 --> 01:59:16,337
"lf you hadn't asked me,
I wouldn't tell you even today."

1089
01:59:17,349 --> 01:59:19,351
Then what was the reason of
coming and staying...

1090
01:59:19,351 --> 01:59:20,750
... in my in-law's home?

1091
01:59:21,353 --> 01:59:25,756
I wanted to see you happy
and console myself.

1092
01:59:27,359 --> 01:59:31,352
But when I saw you were
a devoted wife...

1093
01:59:31,764 --> 01:59:34,756
... but were yet suffering...

1094
01:59:35,367 --> 01:59:37,358
... I was proud of you.

1095
01:59:40,372 --> 01:59:46,368
I could not even bring
myself to end my life.

1096
01:59:47,379 --> 01:59:49,370
Don't say such things!

1097
01:59:50,382 --> 01:59:54,375
"Believe me, I am very happy."

1098
01:59:55,387 --> 01:59:57,378
"See, I am smiling!"

1099
01:59:59,391 --> 02:00:03,327
And I see tears behind
that smile...

1100
02:00:03,529 --> 02:00:05,326
... that don't
brim your eyes.

1101
02:00:06,331 --> 02:00:11,735
"l am ready for any atonement
that will make you happy, Kumud."

1102
02:00:12,337 --> 02:00:15,329
Even I am ready for
any atonement...

1103
02:00:15,541 --> 02:00:17,338
... that will make you happy.

1104
02:00:18,343 --> 02:00:22,336
I feel very hurt when I realise
that for my sake...

1105
02:00:23,348 --> 02:00:25,339
... you left your home
and are wandering around.

1106
02:00:26,752 --> 02:00:31,746
And I have neither given you
the right to cry...

1107
02:00:31,857 --> 02:00:33,757
... nor to seek pardon.

1108
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:38,352
"- Kumud, l...
- Now you take rest."

1109
02:00:38,764 --> 02:00:40,755
There are many things unsaid.

1110
02:00:41,366 --> 02:00:44,767
"We will say some, and maybe
some are left unsaid."

1111
02:01:37,756 --> 02:01:43,353
"Should I blame myself for
Kumud's state, or fate..."

1112
02:01:44,363 --> 02:01:48,766
"... that made me commit the sin,
and punished her for it."

1113
02:01:49,368 --> 02:01:52,769
"l made a mistake,
and she suffered for it."

1114
02:01:54,373 --> 02:01:59,777
"l gave up my right,
and she had to wallow in tears."

1115
02:02:01,313 --> 02:02:05,306
How do I tell her
that she has been widowed?

1116
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:09,318
That she has lost her husband.
How do I tell her?

1117
02:03:14,386 --> 02:03:18,379
"Chander, I am
under your control here."

1118
02:03:18,790 --> 02:03:21,384
But forget putting me
under your control...

1119
02:03:21,793 --> 02:03:25,388
... you did not even look at me
in a way that I may lose control.

1120
02:03:26,398 --> 02:03:28,798
"You are an angel, and l..."

1121
02:03:31,403 --> 02:03:33,803
... I don't even have the
right to touch your feet.

1122
02:03:35,407 --> 02:03:39,400
"But God knows,
that these are the feet..."

1123
02:03:39,544 --> 02:03:43,412
... at which l'd
wished to spend my life.

1124
02:03:44,416 --> 02:03:45,815
Which didn't happen.

1125
02:04:30,395 --> 02:04:35,799
"Your body smooth as
sandalwood, your naughty nature"

1126
02:04:36,401 --> 02:04:40,394
"Your slow smile"

1127
02:04:51,416 --> 02:04:55,819
"Don't blame me, O world"

1128
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:06,354
"lf my heart goes crazy"

1129
02:05:06,765 --> 02:05:11,361
"Your body smooth..."

1130
02:05:27,386 --> 02:05:32,380
"Those wide eyes
like the wide sky"

1131
02:05:32,791 --> 02:05:37,387
"May I be lost in
them like a bird"

1132
02:05:40,399 --> 02:05:45,393
"lf I have the
pillow of your arms"

1133
02:05:45,804 --> 02:05:50,400
"l could even
sleep on burning coals"

1134
02:05:50,809 --> 02:05:55,405
"My heart is losing control"

1135
02:06:01,353 --> 02:06:06,347
"When I saw your
enchanting style"

1136
02:06:06,758 --> 02:06:11,354
"Your body smooth...."

1137
02:06:32,784 --> 02:06:37,778
"Your body is beautiful,
your heart is beautiful"

1138
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:42,793
"You are an image of beauty"

1139
02:06:45,797 --> 02:06:50,791
"Others may not
need you as much"

1140
02:06:51,403 --> 02:06:55,806
"But I need you very much"

1141
02:06:56,408 --> 02:07:00,742
"My heart has craved enough"

1142
02:07:06,751 --> 02:07:11,347
"Don't make it crave anymore"

1143
02:07:11,756 --> 02:07:16,352
"Your body smooth..."

1144
02:07:54,399 --> 02:07:58,802
"Come dear,
I will myself unite you two."

1145
02:08:01,339 --> 02:08:02,328
"Come, son."

1146
02:08:04,342 --> 02:08:05,331
Take.

1147
02:08:07,345 --> 02:08:09,745
No! This can never be!

1148
02:08:11,349 --> 02:08:13,351
"lndian women, with their
sacrifice..."

1149
02:08:13,351 --> 02:08:15,342
... have always protected
the Aryan traditions.

1150
02:08:15,487 --> 02:08:19,355
"lf a woman marries twice in her
life, our religion will die."

1151
02:08:19,758 --> 02:08:22,750
This cannot happen.
It can never happen!

1152
02:08:23,361 --> 02:08:25,352
No....no!

1153
02:08:25,764 --> 02:08:26,753
"Kumud, you?"

1154
02:08:27,365 --> 02:08:32,359
"Pardon me Chander, I got
carried away by emotions."

1155
02:08:33,371 --> 02:08:38,365
"When I dozed off, I saw a
dream that you and me..."

1156
02:08:41,379 --> 02:08:43,779
And my mother-in-law
was blessing us.

1157
02:08:44,783 --> 02:08:51,382
That we two...what a strange
and impossible dream.

1158
02:08:52,791 --> 02:08:54,782
Even I saw that dream.

1159
02:08:55,393 --> 02:09:00,729
"Maybe because, we may be two
bodies, but our hearts are one."

1160
02:09:02,734 --> 02:09:04,725
"Yet, it was just a dream."

1161
02:09:06,338 --> 02:09:10,741
"lt is my misfortune Chander,
that I could not belong to you."

1162
02:09:11,743 --> 02:09:13,335
"But now,
I will be fortunate,..."

1163
02:09:13,478 --> 02:09:17,744
... if you don't renounce the
world and become an ascetic.

1164
02:09:18,350 --> 02:09:20,750
It's my request.

1165
02:09:21,353 --> 02:09:25,346
"And if you don't listen to me,
it's my command."

1166
02:09:26,358 --> 02:09:29,350
I'll accept your command.

1167
02:09:30,762 --> 02:09:34,755
But you....you...

1168
02:09:37,369 --> 02:09:40,361
I will not be able to do
anything until I see you happy.

1169
02:09:41,373 --> 02:09:45,776
"lf you begin your work,
I'll return home in peace."

1170
02:09:46,378 --> 02:09:49,779
- You'll return home?
- What else?

1171
02:09:50,382 --> 02:09:55,376
"l have a husband,
my in-laws."

1172
02:09:56,388 --> 02:09:59,789
- I'll serve them.
- How is that possible now?

1173
02:10:00,725 --> 02:10:04,718
"Why not?...Oh, I understand."

1174
02:10:05,330 --> 02:10:09,323
But even though my husband
doesn't love me...

1175
02:10:10,335 --> 02:10:12,326
... but he belongs to me.

1176
02:10:12,737 --> 02:10:16,332
"And I know,
he's not bad at heart."

1177
02:10:17,342 --> 02:10:21,335
I'll win him over with
my devotion and service.

1178
02:10:24,349 --> 02:10:31,755
"Kumud, a blow has been dealt..."

1179
02:10:32,757 --> 02:10:35,351
... on your pious
thought and high ideal.

1180
02:10:37,362 --> 02:10:38,761
What do you mean?

1181
02:10:40,365 --> 02:10:42,765
"l tried telling you
several times,..."

1182
02:10:43,768 --> 02:10:46,362
... but couldn't
gather the courage.

1183
02:10:48,373 --> 02:10:53,777
Your mother-in-law and
husband have expired.

1184
02:10:58,383 --> 02:11:06,313
No..no..no..no!

1185
02:11:19,337 --> 02:11:22,329
"Kumud, don't do that."

1186
02:11:24,342 --> 02:11:26,333
Have courage.

1187
02:11:33,351 --> 02:11:36,343
There is very little that
separates...

1188
02:11:36,488 --> 02:11:38,752
... the soul from
the divine soul...

1189
02:11:38,857 --> 02:11:41,348
"... meditation from salvation,
duty from truth."

1190
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:43,349
Yes.

1191
02:11:44,362 --> 02:11:47,354
"Yet, the path to achieve it
is very long."

1192
02:11:49,367 --> 02:11:53,360
"Likewise, though
you and me are one..."

1193
02:11:53,772 --> 02:11:55,763
... we are far
away from each other.

1194
02:11:56,374 --> 02:11:59,775
"lf you like, this distance
between us can be erased forever."

1195
02:12:01,312 --> 02:12:04,304
The blessing given by your
mother-in-law in your dream...

1196
02:12:04,716 --> 02:12:09,710
"Chander, you are
so educated, so knowledgeable."

1197
02:12:10,321 --> 02:12:16,317
Don't you know how sacred
widowhood is?

1198
02:12:17,729 --> 02:12:22,325
"And then think, in your
mission of service to mankind..."

1199
02:12:23,735 --> 02:12:26,329
... marriage to a
widow will be a hurdle.

1200
02:12:27,338 --> 02:12:33,334
"Remember, that in today's world,
a single man, without a wife..."

1201
02:12:33,478 --> 02:12:35,343
... cannot serve the people.

1202
02:12:36,347 --> 02:12:39,748
Then just as we have foster
parents and siblings...

1203
02:12:40,351 --> 02:12:45,755
"...I cannot be your foster wife,
but can be your co-worker."

1204
02:12:47,358 --> 02:12:51,351
"With that relationship, I am
always ready to help you,Chander."

1205
02:12:56,367 --> 02:12:59,768
"Earlier, because of my small
mistake, I could not get you."

1206
02:13:00,371 --> 02:13:02,771
And now you knowingly want to
make that same mistake again...

1207
02:13:02,874 --> 02:13:04,774
... that I committed.

1208
02:13:05,777 --> 02:13:09,770
"l ask, what is your problem
in marrying me?"

1209
02:13:13,384 --> 02:13:17,787
That time is lost when
I had no problem whatsoever.

1210
02:13:19,791 --> 02:13:24,785
Now I can only say that I cannot
get over the fear of society...

1211
02:13:26,397 --> 02:13:28,388
... and a woman's inhibition.

1212
02:13:30,401 --> 02:13:34,804
Heed my advise
and marry some nice girl.

1213
02:13:35,807 --> 02:13:37,798
Who is not a widow like me.

1214
02:13:37,909 --> 02:13:40,810
"No Kumud, that is not possible."

1215
02:13:40,912 --> 02:13:43,813
"Without you,
my future seems bleak."

1216
02:13:44,415 --> 02:13:47,407
Brighten it with
the flame of your duty.

1217
02:13:47,819 --> 02:13:49,411
You are my life's flame.

1218
02:13:49,554 --> 02:13:52,819
"Not my body,
but my heart is all yours."

1219
02:13:54,425 --> 02:13:57,826
The patience & courage with which
you have protected my honour...

1220
02:13:58,429 --> 02:14:00,420
... in my home
before my marriage...

1221
02:14:01,366 --> 02:14:03,357
... in my in-laws home
after my marriage...

1222
02:14:04,369 --> 02:14:06,360
"... and now, over here,
in this solitude..."

1223
02:14:07,372 --> 02:14:09,772
... I will forever be
grateful to you for it.

1224
02:14:12,777 --> 02:14:15,371
You saw me as your lover.

1225
02:14:16,381 --> 02:14:19,373
When I was living to realise
the dream of belonging to you.

1226
02:14:20,385 --> 02:14:22,785
You saw me as a married woman.

1227
02:14:23,388 --> 02:14:25,788
When I was living a
tormenting life.

1228
02:14:26,991 --> 02:14:29,789
And now you are
seeing me as a widow.

1229
02:14:30,395 --> 02:14:32,386
"When I am neither living,
nor dead."

1230
02:14:32,797 --> 02:14:36,790
"- Kumud, we still have time.
- No, Chander."

1231
02:14:38,403 --> 02:14:40,394
We have lost the time.

1232
02:14:41,806 --> 02:14:44,798
"First, you had a right over me."

1233
02:14:45,410 --> 02:14:47,810
Then my husband
had a right over me.

1234
02:14:48,813 --> 02:14:53,409
"Now, only I have
a right over myself."

1235
02:14:53,618 --> 02:14:58,817
"Can't l, with my right,
exercise it over your right?"

1236
02:15:00,425 --> 02:15:05,761
"However much you stoke ash,
you cannot turn it to fire."

1237
02:15:07,765 --> 02:15:11,758
"Before leaving, atleast tell me
if you are giving me hope..."

1238
02:15:12,370 --> 02:15:13,769
... or disappointing me?

1239
02:15:15,373 --> 02:15:17,568
There is very little that
separates...

1240
02:15:17,775 --> 02:15:19,367
... hope from disappointment.

1241
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:24,780
Only what is destined
will happen.

1242
02:15:24,882 --> 02:15:26,782
I cannot see her as a widow now.

1243
02:15:27,385 --> 02:15:29,785
"l want that we get her
married here itself,..."

1244
02:15:29,988 --> 02:15:32,388
"... take the sage's
blessings, and leave for home."

1245
02:15:33,791 --> 02:15:36,988
"But just think,
if Kumud gets married..."

1246
02:15:37,395 --> 02:15:39,795
... won't it shatter
her father-in-law?

1247
02:15:40,398 --> 02:15:44,391
Who will look
after his young son?

1248
02:15:44,802 --> 02:15:48,397
"lt is not us, but her in-laws
who have a right over Kumud now."

1249
02:15:48,606 --> 02:15:53,407
I had come here to hand
over my son to Kumud...

1250
02:15:53,811 --> 02:15:57,804
... and surrender my
lineage and property to her.

1251
02:15:58,816 --> 02:16:03,344
But I cannot be selfish and
ruin my daughter-in-law's life.

1252
02:16:04,355 --> 02:16:06,346
I will manage somehow.

1253
02:16:07,358 --> 02:16:08,757
You all rest assured.

1254
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:14,764
"ln the sage's presence,
I release Kumud from all ties."

1255
02:16:15,366 --> 02:16:18,358
"lf the widowed Kumud gets
married, who will marry Kusum?"

1256
02:16:18,770 --> 02:16:21,364
Kusum will have to spend
all her life as a spinster.

1257
02:16:21,773 --> 02:16:27,769
I will get her a husband
as good as Saraswati.

1258
02:16:28,379 --> 02:16:30,779
"Sister-in-law,
good I found you here."

1259
02:16:30,882 --> 02:16:32,782
"Here, look after your
brother-in-law."

1260
02:16:36,387 --> 02:16:39,788
See! He stopped crying the
moment he came into your arms.

1261
02:16:55,406 --> 02:17:00,742
Sister...in what
attire am I seeing you!

1262
02:17:01,345 --> 02:17:04,337
What have you done to yourself?
What has happened to you?

1263
02:17:10,354 --> 02:17:12,345
"Don't cry, Kusum."

1264
02:17:14,358 --> 02:17:19,352
"Kumud, she is the path that will
lead you & Saraswati to your goal."

1265
02:17:20,364 --> 02:17:22,355
Goddess Amba has rescued you.

1266
02:17:23,367 --> 02:17:27,360
"Kusum, you will have to
do your sister a favour."

1267
02:17:27,772 --> 02:17:29,763
Don't talk like that.

1268
02:17:30,374 --> 02:17:34,777
"For your sake, your happiness,
I can even sacrifice my life."

1269
02:17:36,380 --> 02:17:38,371
You won't turn
back from your promise?

1270
02:17:38,783 --> 02:17:39,772
Try me.

1271
02:17:42,386 --> 02:17:45,378
My dear sister!

1272
02:17:55,399 --> 02:17:58,800
"Chander, take these clothes,
get dressed."

1273
02:17:58,903 --> 02:18:00,734
- Why these clothes?
- It's your marriage today.

1274
02:18:01,339 --> 02:18:02,328
So suddenly?

1275
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:04,935
"But why are you saying my
marriage, say our marriage."

1276
02:18:05,343 --> 02:18:06,742
Even you must get dressed.

1277
02:18:06,844 --> 02:18:09,335
"l am ready,
you get dressed quickly."

1278
02:18:09,547 --> 02:18:11,742
I have lots of things to do.
I'll come to take you.

1279
02:18:12,350 --> 02:18:16,343
"Kumud, look into my eyes
and speak."

1280
02:18:17,355 --> 02:18:18,754
Why is your tone changed?

1281
02:18:19,357 --> 02:18:23,760
"Naturally, it's my
happiest day in life."

1282
02:18:24,362 --> 02:18:26,353
It's the day of your marriage.

1283
02:18:26,764 --> 02:18:30,757
There is no one else who
knows and understands you...

1284
02:18:31,369 --> 02:18:33,360
... better than I do.

1285
02:18:33,771 --> 02:18:36,763
Tell me the truth.
What are you hiding from me?

1286
02:18:38,776 --> 02:18:43,770
I'd thought you'll honour me
by not asking any questions.

1287
02:18:46,384 --> 02:18:51,378
The decision I have taken
is in your and my interest.

1288
02:18:52,390 --> 02:18:55,382
I am getting you
married to Kusum.

1289
02:18:57,395 --> 02:18:59,795
"No, that's impossible!"

1290
02:19:00,398 --> 02:19:04,732
"lf ever there is anyone who l
can accept as my wife, it's you."

1291
02:19:04,835 --> 02:19:05,824
Only you.

1292
02:19:05,937 --> 02:19:07,336
"It's in everyone's
interest, Chander."

1293
02:19:07,471 --> 02:19:09,530
You will return
to worldly life.

1294
02:19:09,740 --> 02:19:11,731
Your parents will
get back their son.

1295
02:19:11,842 --> 02:19:13,742
The world will
get a social worker.

1296
02:19:13,844 --> 02:19:15,744
Kusum will get
a husband like you.

1297
02:19:16,347 --> 02:19:17,746
I will be able
to discharge my duty.

1298
02:19:18,349 --> 02:19:20,749
"l have a little brother-in-law,
and father-in-law."

1299
02:19:20,851 --> 02:19:23,342
They have no one but me.

1300
02:19:23,487 --> 02:19:28,356
"And then, my sister is my image.
She respects you very much."

1301
02:19:28,492 --> 02:19:29,959
She likes you very much.

1302
02:19:30,361 --> 02:19:33,762
"And remember, when you came to
our house for the first time..."

1303
02:19:33,965 --> 02:19:35,956
... you'd thought she was Kumud.

1304
02:19:36,367 --> 02:19:38,767
This is no joke.

1305
02:19:39,370 --> 02:19:43,966
"l cannot do this injustice
to myself, to you, to Kusum."

1306
02:19:45,376 --> 02:19:47,776
I am sad to know you
thought along those lines.

1307
02:19:48,379 --> 02:19:50,779
- But I won't let that happen.
- Atleast listen to me.

1308
02:19:51,782 --> 02:19:54,376
"You'd asked if
with your right,..."

1309
02:19:54,518 --> 02:19:56,986
... you could
exercise it over my right?

1310
02:19:57,388 --> 02:19:59,379
I ask you the same thing today.

1311
02:19:59,790 --> 02:20:01,724
If I have no right over you...

1312
02:20:02,326 --> 02:20:04,726
... what right do you have
to get me married to Kusum?

1313
02:20:04,829 --> 02:20:06,922
I don't have
to express my right.

1314
02:20:07,331 --> 02:20:09,731
I know you accept that
I have a right over you.

1315
02:20:10,334 --> 02:20:13,735
"Trust me, whenever you want..."

1316
02:20:14,338 --> 02:20:17,330
... you will find me besides
you as your co-worker.

1317
02:20:17,742 --> 02:20:19,733
"That's only a feeling, not life."

1318
02:20:20,344 --> 02:20:23,336
"lt is merely a consolation,
not reality."

1319
02:20:24,348 --> 02:20:27,340
"lf I cannot get you as
my wife, then know this..."

1320
02:20:27,485 --> 02:20:32,752
"...that you'd met some Saraswati
in your life, who's no more."

1321
02:20:33,357 --> 02:20:36,349
"Don't be so cruel and
heartless, I plead with you."

1322
02:20:36,494 --> 02:20:37,552
I cannot grant it.

1323
02:20:37,762 --> 02:20:39,753
- I order you!
- I cannot accept it!

1324
02:20:39,864 --> 02:20:44,767
- I beg of you.
- I cannot give.

1325
02:20:48,372 --> 02:20:54,777
"Where are you going,
O ascetic"

1326
02:20:56,781 --> 02:21:00,717
"You are running away from life"

1327
02:21:06,324 --> 02:21:12,320
"For just one heart"

1328
02:21:13,331 --> 02:21:20,328
"You are renouncing the world"

1329
02:21:26,344 --> 02:21:31,748
"Renouncing the
world for someone"

1330
02:21:32,350 --> 02:21:36,753
"ls not possible for man"

1331
02:21:47,765 --> 02:21:52,759
"There are more important
things than love"

1332
02:21:53,371 --> 02:21:57,774
"Love is not
everything in life"

1333
02:21:58,376 --> 02:22:03,313
"Renouncing the world..."

1334
02:22:24,335 --> 02:22:29,739
"So what if we could
not unite physically"

1335
02:22:30,341 --> 02:22:34,744
"It's okay that
our hearts are united"

1336
02:22:42,753 --> 02:22:47,747
"Even if you can get
the fragrance from afar"

1337
02:22:48,359 --> 02:22:53,353
"It's okay if you have
the garden before you"

1338
02:23:01,372 --> 02:23:06,366
"Everyone doesn't get
the moon in the world"

1339
02:23:14,385 --> 02:23:19,379
"Even a lamp is enough
to brighten your world"

1340
