1
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,300
Yes, Roma?
- Vicky has been admitted to hospital.

2
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,200
- He is in the hospital!
.- Yes. - Which hospital?

3
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,100
Broken?

4
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,700
The...
the leg is also broken.

5
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,400
Except his tongue,
he broke everything.

6
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,000
Just tell me
how did this happen!?

7
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,700
A girl was skying at Mount Hut.

8
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,400
The owner of a hotel
tried to abuse her.

9
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,700
Then I tried to save her !

10
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,400
Who are you?
Raju!

11
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,400
- He is an Indian!
Yes

12
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,100
He comes from abroad and
gives us Indians a very bad name!

13
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,700
Tell the doctor to reserve
the bed next to him

14
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,300
What did you say his name was?

15
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
The bachelor is here

16
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,400
I long for love

17
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,800
Pretty girls drive me crazy

18
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
I fall for their eyes

19
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,000
There a star on earth
instead of in the sky

20
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,300
One holds me close to her heart

21
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,200
One is very precious to me

22
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,800
The whole day I was thinking

23
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,200
I captured someones heart

24
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,200
I stayed in the homes
of beautifull girls as their lover

25
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,400
I will give love to the ones
that love me

26
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,600
I will give up my life for her

27
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,700
Still my name is mentioned

28
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,900
There is always someone
to support me

29
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,900
I tease those pretty girls
by seducing them

30
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,300
Why did you come all the way from India
to New Zeeland to die in the ice

31
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,700
You could have killed yourself there
in a cannel of a river!

32
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,600
I'm here to kill someone else
and not myslef!

33
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
You are going to kill someone?
Yes, I am serious.

34
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Your eyes could easily kill!

35
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,100
Don't act foolish
Let me lay my hands on him.

36
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,100
I will break each leg
of this idiot!

37
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,800
Who is this idiot?
- an Indian!

38
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,800
He owns a restaurant

39
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,600
What's his name?

40
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,500
- Do you know him?
I think so...

41
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,500
Take me to him!

42
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,100
I won't spare him!
But what did he do?

43
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,100
Something unforgivable!
I am too ashamed to repeat it again!

44
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,100
You are ashamed to tell.
Won't you be ashamed when you hit him?

45
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,700
He will then surely admit!

46
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,700
I even reserved a bed in hospital
for him already

47
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,600
Who paid using my name?

48
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,500
I will get you locked up

49
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
I will go and confirm he is Raju.

50
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,700
Return quickly.

51
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,700
She really looks desperate

52
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,100
Did she treat you fair?

53
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,900
Be honest and tell you saw it.

54
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Why is this always happening to you?
Who knows why!

55
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,400
Everytime I try to flirt with a girl
I end up being hit.

56
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,700
Girls surround you.

57
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,500
Isn't it possible to exchange our names
just for a day?

58
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,500
I will fullfill all your dreams today

59
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,000
How?
You see that girl?

60
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,500
So, she looks Indian!

61
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,200
She looks fantastic!
Shall I hit on her?

62
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,800
"She will hit on you,
Just wait and see"

63
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,700
No!- I tell you, don't I!
How. - I thoughgt I told you.

64
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,900
- How??? - Let her think
you are Raju, and not Gopal.

65
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,500
Go and tell her that I'm Raju!
But don't spoil it for us.

66
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,000
"I'm Raju, I'm still Raju
and I'll always be Raju!"

67
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,000
I will scream and tear my shirt!

68
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,500
"I will scream Raju!
and tear my shirt".

69
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,500
"You will scream Raju!
And I will tear your clothes".

70
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,200
tear my shirt and clothes...

71
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,200
"Mam, be carefull, he knows
we're at his tail.

72
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,400
He won't escape.

73
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,100
Be carefull! The guy looks dangerous.
I will wait here.

74
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,600
In 2 minutes I'll interfere...

75
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,000
So you are Raju?

76
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,600
Do I look like Aamir Khan?

77
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,200
"I thought you'd be 5 foot tall,
beard... the weird type"

78
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,200
but in the end
you turn out to be a comedian.

79
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
It won't be difficult for me
to kill you!

80
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
Were you impressed you my body
and seize?

81
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,100
Don't you know me?

82
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,300
Half of all the policemen in this country
are helping

83
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,100
- What happened?
He has a gun!

84
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,400
Yes, I can see thet.
But... just a minute.

85
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Your indian yourself.
Why do you wanna kill another?

86
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,900
- What's your problem?
- Be quiet!

87
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Hold her. Not like that.
Put your arms around her

88
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,100
I will not hold a girl in my arms!

89
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,800
I am not that type of guy.

90
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Don't talk that much, or I shoot you!

91
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,300
Do it!
Hold me quickly, otherwise he'll shoot!

92
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,300
No, I'll only hold the girl I love
in my arms.

93
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,000
for I am a different kind of guy.
Just imagine I am the girl.

94
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,000
you will marry.
Hug me, quick!

95
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,100
Ok.
More tight.

96
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,100
Why are you doing this?

97
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,100
I'm doing an experiment.
What sort of experiment?

98
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,800
I only have one bullet. I wanna see
if it can kill 2 people.

99
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,300
No brother!
Be prepared to die.

100
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,700
Be alert with your eyes closed.
Don't open your eyes!

101
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,300
The tension is rising..

102
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,700
He ran off!
He spoilt the mood!

103
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,300
I mean, where will he go?
Besides, what did Raju do?

104
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,200
First catch him.
Than I will tell you.

105
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,900
Where will he go to? He'll need to come
to this restaurant.

106
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,000
We will wait here. Why do you not wanna tell
me why you want to beat him?

107
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,100
He will tell it yourself!

108
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,900
Wait here for 2 minutes.
I'll be back in 5 minutes.

109
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Could you not find another place
to hide?

110
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,400
I have not had anything else than
beatings since this morning.

111
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,400
You will be beaten up in the restaurant.
Why?

112
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,900
She sits right in front of you.

113
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Go away.

114
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,900
You come too. I'm having fun!

115
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
You want to find Raju?
Yes, where is he?

116
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,900
You won't find him here.
I saw him just there.

117
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,400
Where is he?

118
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,800
My love has blossomed

119
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,400
You are pretty and I am young.
My life is with you

120
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,000
Lets start the season of love.

121
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Happy-go-lucky

122
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,100
Go away, don't give me heart-burn

123
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,800
Don't mention my name in vain.
Be a little patient.

124
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,000
Let there be a little distance
between us.

125
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,200
The look in your eyes

126
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,800
courtship in your breaths

127
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,500
the sweet smell..

128
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,500
The king of my dreams

129
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,900
What a fool,
He doesn't pay attention to me.

130
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,400
He does not understand my vulnerability,
nor my pain.

131
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,000
He lost his mind and
has gone completely mad.

132
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Why are you teasing me?

133
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
I won't come in your arms.

134
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,100
Let me go. I need to go.

135
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,400
You are a silly fool.

136
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,300
Where are you going after driving me
this crzay?

137
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,100
Try to give me your heart.

138
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Embrace me and
forget the pain ..

139
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
This looks like my clothes..

140
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,700
It are your clothes.

141
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,400
How did this happen?

142
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,100
This happened at night.

143
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,500
I can't tell you what you did
intoxicated by the Irish Coffee.

144
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,700
What did I do?
You removed your clothes..

145
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,100
And threw them away.

146
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,400
In front of you?
No, I turned around.

147
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,400
Is that true?
Absolutely.

148
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,700
But then you removed my sleeping geer
and put them on..

149
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,600
In front of you?
No, I turned around.

150
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,100
Then it's fine.
Not that I remember anything.

151
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,700
But you tell the truth.
Don't worry, I am a decent person.

152
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,500
I don't even look at myself in the bath tub.
So how can I look at you?

153
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,100
By the way, Urmila..

154
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,700
... the mole on your hips, would look
very beautifull on your lips!

155
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,200
but..

156
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,500
Scoundrel! I won't spare you!

157
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,600
What happened?
you're such a dirty old man!

158
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,100
Will you tell me something, or
will you keep hitting me!?

159
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,200
Who is Gopal? He is Raju.

160
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,300
I hit him so hard,
he won't stand up till morning!

161
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Tomorrow morning? I don't think he will
ever get up again.

162
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,400
What do you mean?
I mean he is gone.

163
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,800
He is dead!

164
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,100
She hits very hard.
Listen to me..

165
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,600
You are dead. Pretend to be
a dead body. Listen!

166
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,800
Only when you are dead, she will tell
why she's after Raju.

167
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,500
Quick, play dead again!

168
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,200
I tried pumping, but no success

169
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,400
Is he really dead?
I think so.

170
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,800
Will the police come here?
Yes.

171
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,600
Will they arrest me?
Yes.

172
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Will they hang me?
Yes

173
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,600
Please, help me. You know I did not
do this on purpose!

174
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,100
What did Raju do?
I will tell you later.

175
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,800
Do something first with 
the body.

176
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,800
Are you crazy? If he kills the body, 
he will be accused for it.

177
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,200
We will be saved!
What? He is my friend!

178
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,800
What?
You don't understand.

179
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,400
Wht ? If he cuts his head of, we will
take the head to one place..

180
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,800
and the body to another place.

181
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,800
How can you say that?
What?

182
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,400
What happened to him?
You hit him...

183
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,300
The soul... the soul gave him a shock.
You too be polite.

184
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,900
Let's get rid of the body,
before someone comes.

185
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,500
Quick!
Before someone comes..

186
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,900
I will turn his finger towards him.
Don't worry.

187
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,900
Sit down quickly!

188
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,100
Quiet! I won't tell you.

189
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,900
Where did you bring us?
What is this?

190
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,600
It's a scrap-heap.
I know that.

191
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,600
What are we doing here with the body?
Very simple.

192
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,600
Cars are redundant
and dumped at the scrap-heap..

193
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,200
The car and the body will be crushed
and nobody will find out.

194
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,900
I said, down!
I asked you to bent down.

195
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,400
Police is coming..

196
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,400
The police is here!

197
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,900
What do we do now? Don't be afraid.
Think of something. What?

198
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,400
I have an idea.
What?

199
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,900
Hold me tight and kiss me.

200
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,700
Kiss me untill the police leaves.

201
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,900
I will only kiss the one I love
and who I will marry!

202
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,900
That's not true!
Did I not take you in my arms?

203
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,900
Pretend I am the one
you love and will marry! No!

204
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The police will arrest us both and
we'll both die. I'm not worried.

205
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,800
Are they gone?
Yes.

206
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,700
They did not see the body?

207
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,800
No. Even dead, he looks very innocent.

208
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,600
As if he is asleep.

209
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
What will we do?
The police has seen him.

210
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It's not good to leave him here.
Lets take him to the hotel.

211
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
After a cup of tea, we will decide
how to get rid of him.

212
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,400
Move to the back!

213
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,700
Dirty body!
Remove the lipstick.

214
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,500
When did this happen?

215
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,700
Nobody is looking, quickly!

216
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,700
Quick!
I am hurrying.

217
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,000
Shall I help? No, I'll manage.
You don't need to worry.

218
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,700
How did the body got bent?

219
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,100
Simple, every body bents when you make it
stand up, and this is a fine body.

220
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,300
I have no expreience, so I did not
know that at all.

221
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,100
Don't talk that loud.
We will be caught.

222
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,100
Put him down first!

223
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,700
His body... it won't go straight.

224
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,600
Tell me why this body is so stiff?

225
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,600
It doesn't matter. The body is cold.
It is cold!

226
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,900
After his dead, it will haunt us.

227
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,600
That happens sometimes.
What are you doing?

228
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,900
What happened? What?

229
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,900
Why are you hitting it?
It will hurt the body!

230
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,100
Why is it starring at me?
Where?

231
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,800
It's a body. Enjoy it.

232
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,500
Did you not see the Zee Horror Show?
I'll do one thing...

233
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,500
I'll put glasses on him.
It will break the eyecontact.

234
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,900
Here.. Did you see Zee Horror?
"Ramsay's film, "Aram se"?"

235
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,400
Look how comfortable he is lying.

236
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,400
I think you are hungry. Yes
I'll bring some food.

237
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
I'm not hungry! How can I 
stay here all by myself?

238
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,100
The body will stay with you.

239
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,600
I've brought you dinner.

240
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,600
You did not tell me what Raju did.

241
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,000
Can I eat first! I'm dying!

242
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,700
Where's the body?
I hid it.

243
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,500
Where?
In the fridge.

244
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,000
In the fridge? He is dead!

245
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,300
Is he dead? Yes!
Of course he is dead!

246
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,000
Try to understand.
The body will turn into ice cream!

247
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,900
If we take it out, it
will stink.

248
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,700
If we leave him in, the fridge
will start stinking.

249
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,000
He is here..
What?

250
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,900
The body is a body..
It has not turned into ice cream yet.

251
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,900
There is hope for him.

252
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,900
Why don't you eat, while I check
the body.

253
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,700
This man must have been very arrogant.
This stiff after his death!

254
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,600
Stand straight, friend.

255
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,100
Look for cover under the covers, 
otherwiste you will die.

256
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,100
I almost have him out.

257
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,800
What are you doing? Are you crazy or what?

258
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,100
We will be killed because of you!
Hide!

259
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,900
Lay still!

260
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,000
What happened? Nothing.
Shameless body! You eat dinner.

261
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,600
Listen..
Yes?

262
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,700
I heared that there are ghosts and spooks
that come out in the dark.

263
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,700
Yes, I heard too.

264
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,300
They don't just come out. I heard
they dance, sing and laugh.

265
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,000
And also eat.

266
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,700
What happened?

267
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,100
The lights went down.

268
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,800
What is happening?
He changed into a ghost!

269
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,300
Come here, Urmila!

270
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,600
This ghost really dances.

271
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,000
Now he will also eat.

272
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,900
Look, he started eating.

273
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,100
What had Raju done?

274
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,000
He changed to a body again!

275
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,300
Yes, the ghost came in the dark
and went when it became light again.

276
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:14,700
Go to bed quickly, because we need to get
rid of the body at dawn.

277
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
By the way, what did Raju do?

278
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,700
Tell me, man!

279
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
The cliff is at the bridge.

280
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,000
I'll get rid of it.
I'll come with you.

281
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,400
No, you just sit here quietly.

282
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,700
It is cold!

283
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,800
I will help you.

284
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,400
What is this? Saw the ghost again?
Take him away! He is starring at me!

285
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,100
&$% this body!
en & *%#

286
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
I will make him tremble!

287
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,400
Come here and jump down!

288
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,100
Why are you screaming?

289
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,700
Who is screaming?

290
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,900
I pushed it from such a height that
every body would have screamed.

291
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,900
But what did Raju do?

292
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,300
What did he do?
Let's go away from here!

293
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,400
It;s so cold! Come!

294
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,900
Thank God, we are safe!

295
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,100
You really helped me a lot.

296
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,200
No need to thank you.
It was my duty

297
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,900
But I wonder how I came to New Zeeland to
start a new life...

298
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,400
..ending up involved in a murder.
But listen..

299
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,800
Don't tell anyone about the murder.
Don't be foolish!

300
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,500
How can anybody else get to know?
Only we know about it.

301
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,400
You don't understand. Tomorrow I might get
married to someone else.

302
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,900
You will marry someone else.
Our children will also get children.

303
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,300
And you will tell them stories on what 
happened when I went abroad...

304
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,800
The law doesn't judge based on age

305
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,500
We can still get caught.
And I am convinced we will get caught!

306
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,200
Think of something! Quick!
There is only one way out.

307
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,700
instead of marrying someone else,
we can marry each other.

308
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,500
You won't tell this story to your children.

309
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,300
And you will forget this story,
to save your husband.

310
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,300
No way.
And even when we would get caught..

311
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,000
we will enter as a couple.

312
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,200
Then just tell me, that you will
marry me!

313
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,100
I told you what is in my heart.
Now tell me what's in yours.

314
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,300
I'll have to think.

315
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,100
You only have 10 seconds.

316
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,900
Raju, you!! What a friend you are!

317
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,100
You threw me away 
for that girl!

318
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,500
I did everything for our friendship!

319
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,800
I changed into a body!

320
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,300
Chamged from Gopal into Raju!

321
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,500
Why do you make monkey gestures?

322
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,400
What do you mean?

323
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,000
What do you think..?

324
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,300
One minute!

325
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,500
Such a disappointment! Why did you
do this to me?

326
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,900
I wanna know what I did, that you
want to kill me!

327
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,400
I thought you were such a good person,
but you turned out a real scoundrel.

328
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,000
But what did I do?

329
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,100
I will tell you, but you need
to come with me.

330
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,000
Ok, let's go.

331
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,900
Sorry for leaving you in the cold.

332
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Don't hit me.
Come out!

333
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,100
Don't hit me!

334
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,100
What did you tell her?

335
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,300
I don't even know her.

336
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,600
Tell the truth. You don't need to be scared
when I'm with you.

337
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,100
What did you tell her? What?

338
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,600
I will beat you up so seriously
that no doctor can heal you.

339
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,600
He didn't do anything!
Who did?

340
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,000
Me!

341
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,700
I don't want diamond, nor gold
or silver.

342
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,700
I just want to be the toy of your heart.

343
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,700
I don't want the sun, nor the moon
or the stars.

344
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,700
I want a bachelor like you.

345
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,700
Your dark braided hair and
your dark brown eyes.

346
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,100
They are crazy and are all 
talking about you.

347
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,800
I want the support of your arms

348
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,800
My rose colored youth is only for you

349
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,800
Oh my life, give me a sign

350
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,300
I wanna loose myself in your dreams

351
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,200
Will you say something, or will you
stand there like that?

352
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,400
Are you going to India?
I've come to visit the airport

353
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,900
The flight will leave shortly and
we will return with our lugage.

354
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,600
Isn't it Gopal? Yes
why are you scolding me?

355
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,900
But will you come back?
No. My girlfriend lives in India.

356
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,100
I will marry her and settle.
There is no reason to come back.

357
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,900
Raju, why are you irritated?

358
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,500
Talk about love.
How?

359
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,700
I've never been in love.
This is the first time.

360
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,900
l don't know how to talk about love.

361
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,600
You don't know? Have you never
seen a movie?

362
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,700
The actress comes to the airport to 
meet the actor. He hugs her.

363
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,200
He's about to kiss her, when an
important announcement is made..

364
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,700
It's time for the flight...
Im sorry

365
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,600
Why are you sorry?
l'm your servant.

366
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,900
Haven't you heard?
You'll miss the flight.

367
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,400
l hand over the body to you.
Hey you dead. Look after her.

368
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,900
Let's go. This is a flight, not a train
that will stop when pulling the cord.

369
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,900
Just go. l need to answer the pilot.

370
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,400
What's up?

371
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,000
Father will kill me.

372
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,800
Because of breaking a glass frame?

373
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,700
Buy a new one before going home.

374
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,500
Where are you going?

375
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,700
Hey, you're crying!

376
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,700
Here is a handkerchief. Dry your tears.

377
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,500
Put that away.

378
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,500
Cry on my shoulder. l will comfort you
with love.

379
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,000
You seem to enjoy wiping other
people's tears.

380
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,400
Friend, you're toom much.

381
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,000
Get out.

382
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,700
Out. Come!

383
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,400
This is a railway, not a garden.
The train is coming.

384
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:39,100
I wait for the train.
Wait on the platform.

385
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,400
You could get killed here.
I want to die!

386
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,500
Are you crazy? Peole don't kill themselves
because of a broken heart, don't they!

387
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,900
And you wanna kill yourself because
the frame broke?!

388
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,100
You don't understand. It's not about
the frame.

389
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,100
You probably told your parents you
would score an 8 on your exams.

390
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,500
And you failed. How will you face 
your family now.

391
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,100
No...? Than this one is correct.

392
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,600
Your family made you marry the ugly son
of a rich man.

393
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,100
And you don't love him.
Well?

394
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,500
Not even that?

395
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,600
Then it must be a matter of love.

396
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,600
You fell in love and he...

397
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,100
Forget about me. We will never meet 
in this life again.

398
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,700
Don't try to meet me again. Ajay.

399
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,200
So you fell in love.

400
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,000
The boy has no courage to talk to you
face to face..

401
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,000
You want to kill yourself because of
the man who wrote this?

402
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,900
l would adivce to marry a boy
your parents choose for you.

403
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,700
But when my parents find out..
How ill they find out?

404
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,700
when you don't tell them!

405
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,500
They will find out in a few days.

406
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,700
l am pregnant.

407
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,000
The one who cheated on you, 
is wrong.

408
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,200
Why you want to punish an inocent
baby for that?

409
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,200
You tell me what I should do.

410
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,200
Tell them the thruth. They will
find a solution.

411
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,900
you don't know my father.

412
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,900
He has a bad mood.

413
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:43,000
His honor means more to him
than his own life!

414
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,100
He will first kill me. Then himself.

415
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,600
We got married in the temple
because we were afraid of him.

416
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,100
There is no other way out.

417
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,900
There is. You can take someone else home
as your husband.

418
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,000
He can stay a few days
and then leave again.

419
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,200
Everybody will curse him, but you'll
be home again.

420
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,700
And your baby will find a family.

421
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,900
It's easy to give advice..
But who in the world..

422
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,600
..would help me?

423
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,100
Search and you'll surely find someone.

424
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,700
Will you help me?

425
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,600
Me..?

426
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,300
These fields are ours.

427
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,000
l have a mother, grandfather..

428
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,300
Grandmother..
All are very kind..

429
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,800
Father is also very kind.
He just has a bad mood sometimes.

430
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,500
Bandits! You didn't tell me
that bandits come to your village!

431
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,600
Mister bandit, why did you leave Chambal
and came to us?

432
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,000
How dare you call sir a bandit?

433
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,200
Thakur is hunting?

434
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,900
The days for huting animals
are over.

435
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,400
l will bring you to court if you
would kill one bird only.

436
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,700
You will be locked up!
What are you doing?

437
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,000
What's the worst thing you can do?
Shoot me?

438
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,800
He is my dad!

439
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,100
My good dad. Don't hunt
for animals.

440
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,900
you could go to jail for that.

441
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,000
Who is he?
My husband...

442
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,400
Mother! Come and see what present
your darling brought you!

443
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,700
What happened, son?
Without lighting a match..

444
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,100
your daughter has set fire 
to our honor.

445
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,900
What did the cild do?
She came back as Mrs.

446
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,200
Every pretty girl will get married
and leave her parental house!

447
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,000
And your daughter got married 
and came back to her parental house!

448
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,400
What will you tell her?
Stand up !

449
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,400
What are you staring?

450
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,400
Won't you give them your blessing?

451
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,800
You got married and... when?

452
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,800
Who is this boy?

453
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,700
He will tell us.
Hey, who are you?

454
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,200
What's your name?
Raju.

455
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,300
You talk as if you are the prince
of somewhere!

456
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,200
What do you do for a living?
I have a eating house.

457
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,300
On the street?
No.

458
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,400
You bake savories?
Or do you sell balls?

459
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,800
By changing the menu, your status
won't change!

460
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,400
Let him speak.
He has no face to speak!

461
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,100
I though my daughter would study
and return with a tittle.

462
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,100
But this is what she brought home!

463
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,100
What is wrong with is?
Please keep quiet, you!

464
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:16,800
Why are you silent? Why don't you tell
that what she did is totally wrong!

465
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,800
Yes, it is wrong, but...
But what?

466
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,500
If she accepted him as her husband,
you should do the same.

467
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,500
you can consider him Sharmila's husband,
but he is not my son-in-law!

468
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,200
Don't worry. l'm with you.

469
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,000
You know what kind of mood your father
can have.

470
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,500
Forget about me, even his father is
too scared to talk to him.

471
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:59,200
I am his daughter. He should have
offended me.

472
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,300
But he did not need to offend Raju
in such a manner!

473
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,300
His outburst is justified.

474
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,300
A mother is extatic when she gets
a baby.

475
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,500
A father is more extatic
when she gets married.

476
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,900
you took away this right from him.

477
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,000
Ofcourse that will drive him crazy.

478
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,900
Dinner is being served. Call Raju.

479
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,400
Be seated, son.

480
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,100
When I was making my morning walk
they villagers asked me..

481
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,400
Thakur, we've heard your daughter
has got married.

482
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,600
l told them you studied together
at the university.

483
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,000
They fell in love and got married.

484
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,600
He is only usefull to run a canteen,
not to attend a university!

485
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,600
Darling, you can also tell your grandfather
how you got married.

486
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,900
Otherwise he will come up everyday with
a new story and drive everybody crazy.

487
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,200
When did you see Sharmila
for the very first time?

488
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,600
On the rail tracks.
Was she about to jump?

489
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,600
I was jumping rope at university.

490
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
Where did you meet for the first time?

491
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,000
ln Poona.

492
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,300
The place is not important.
When did you meet the first time?

493
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,300
It was raining slightly.

494
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,600
Nothing.. why do you intoregate him?

495
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,300
They could have met anywhere.
Hw married my big daughter.

496
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,300
We know about it, but his parents
should also know.

497
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,100
I don't have parents.

498
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,100
Where did you grow up?
ln an orphanage.

499
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,200
Did you hear that?

500
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,000
This is the thruth about him!

501
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:10,500
His life started in an orphanage and
will end in a canteen!

502
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,900
You should proudly tell about the history
of your 400 year old clan!

503
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,600
Your father built a university,
your grandfather a hospital.

504
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,900
Our ancestors were land owners.
They built 5 canals and 2 water wells.

505
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,100
Now he is also member of that family.
He built a canteen!

506
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,700
What did you think 
when you married my daughter?

507
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,900
Compare yourself to us!

508
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,900
Large rivers meet the sea,
no small wells!

509
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,900
Father-in-law, the mighty seas can not
quench the thirst.

510
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:45,200
Even when it's small, it is the well
that offers water to the thirsty.

511
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:13,700
You have to bear a lot
because of me...

512
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,500
Come and sit here.

513
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,000
You should not take the words
of an elder as an insult.

514
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,200
There hides love in their scolding.

515
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,400
You never wondered why God
gave us two ears?

516
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,500
Wasn't one enough?

517
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,000
Why did he give us a pair?
One ear in, the other ear out!

518
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,400
What is important.
Our love story should be the same.

519
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,700
Otherwise we both will tell different
things and we will be caught.

520
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,700
The story should be, that we met
at my orphanage.

521
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,600
And that meeting blossomed to love.

522
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,100
I went to New Sealand to make money
and when I came back..

523
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,100
... out of fear for your father...
we married in a temple.

524
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,800
Son...
Grandfather?

525
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,000
I come to apologize
for the mistakes of Balraj.

526
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,600
Guest are considered holy.
And the way he treated you.

527
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,600
I apologize on behalf of him.
No.....

528
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,400
Tell me, this son..
You mean, your father-in-law?

529
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,600
When did he smile for the last time?

530
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,300
How many years ago?

531
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,800
Can you remember? No...
Me neither..

532
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,400
Does he only have one expression?
Anger.

533
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,300
I will smile for him.

534
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,100
This...

535
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,300
Why two seperate beds?
The truth is...

536
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,800
I get a back pain if I sleep
on the bed.

537
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,000
And she gets pain in her back
when she sleeps down.

538
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,600
So I sleep down
and she sleeps on the bed.

539
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,600
You are lying, aren't you?

540
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,600
Lying to me?

541
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,200
Have you been fighting?

542
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,800
because of her father!

543
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,600
What a father-in-law!

544
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,500
He creates a distance between
his daughter and son-in-law!

545
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,800
I won't spare him!
I will talk to him!

546
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,500
Don't... You will see, today we will have
a tug-of-war!

547
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,400
I am his father. He is not mine!

548
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,300
Watch!
Grandfather.

549
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,600
Where are you?

550
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,200
Yes..?

551
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,200
What is the problem???

552
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,700
I forgot to wish you goodnight.

553
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,900
Mother! Grandma!

554
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,400
Granddad!

555
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,900
Little Misses! You..?

556
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,400
Where is everybody? Nobody to be seen.

557
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,900
They went to the temple.
Why?

558
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:22,900
Sharmila has married. They have taken
her and her husband with them.

559
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,900
She got married.

560
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,900
This temple was built by our ancestors.

561
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,200
The bride and broom were always
brought her after their marriage.

562
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,900
Good day, sir.
Good day.

563
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,500
This is Sharmila's husband, Raju.

564
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,200
Shall I start the prayers?

565
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,600
Come with me.

566
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,900
When did you arrive? Granddad!
When did you arrive?

567
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,800
Later. First tell me when Sharmila
and brother-in-law are.

568
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,300
There.

569
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,600
Place your hand on Nandi and
be blessed by Lord Shiva.

570
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,500
No... no...

571
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,400
Blessed by the look of God?

572
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,000
No, by a Goddess.

573
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,700
This is the younger sister of Sharmila.

574
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,800
And this is Raju, the husband of Sharmila
and your brother-in-law.

575
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:41,000
Goodday, brother-in-law!

576
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,600
No... okay.
What are you doing?

577
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,600
Lord, help me.

578
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,400
Good day.

579
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,900
lnder, stop!

580
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,600
Get up, son.

581
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,700
You threw me off.
The horse did, not me.

582
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,800
you know he throws off anybody
when he hears whistling.

583
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,600
Still you whistled!
Ok.

584
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,800
The younger daughter of Balraj, Urmila
came back from New Zealand.

585
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,700
What can I do.
You morron!!

586
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,100
You could not marry Sharmila.

587
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,500
You can marry Urmila.
No, father.

588
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,700
My marriage with Sharmila was arranged,
but she married someone else.

589
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,700
I don't want to marry someone
from that family!

590
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:37,100
Use your head, nut!

591
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,700
What has Urmila got to do with it?

592
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,600
We just want Balraj's wealth.

593
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:47,100
Put your clothes on, quick. I will talk
to Balraj about you and Urmila.

594
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,800
Dear, bring me a cup of tea.

595
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,100
What is this?
Why don't you talk to me?

596
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,800
What do you wanna talk about,
brother-in-law?

597
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,100
I'm not your brother-in-law!

598
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,100
That's what you call the husband 
of a sister, ooh brother-in-law!

599
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,100
What are you talking about?

600
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,900
Did you have to come now?
What do you mean?

601
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,600
We were talking about something personal.

602
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:16,000
Indeed. I asked if there is a boy
she liked in New Zealand.

603
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,600
Shew should tell me about it, otherwise
she'll end up in the same situation as me.

604
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,500
She is leaving
Go ask her...

605
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,900
Why are you following me?

606
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,600
I don't wanna talk to you!

607
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,100
Come for breakfast.

608
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,500
Go ahead, brother-in-law!
No, I'm not hungry.

609
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,600
I know you are not hungry after
all those hooks.

610
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,100
Why do you take everything
so serious?

611
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,200
Your father sees you like this and
that irritates him even more.

612
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,900
When you smile, he at least thinks
that his daughter is happy.

613
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,500
When you eat, I will feel satisfied.

614
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,800
Why do you accept this
acid haze?

615
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,000
No... no!

616
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,200
The whole will come!

617
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,000
Your grimy old dad will come!

618
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,900
Open the door!
Urmila, open the door!

619
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,700
Don't give your life for me, please!

620
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,200
If you do something without listening to me,
I will never forgive myself.

621
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,900
Don't do it.

622
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,200
Why did you use insecticide?

623
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,800
I wanted to kill a cock-roach!

624
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,200
I won't kill myself because of you!

625
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,000
You're already killing me, 
by calling me brother-in-law!

626
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,500
What happened?

627
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,000
Brother-in-law slipped.

628
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:01,200
My brother decided to follow a man
that can't even take two stepps!

629
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,600
I will wet him.

630
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:13,100
Wha is happening. Guests are her.
Why are you irritated?

631
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,600
Congratulations.

632
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,200
Welcome.

633
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,900
We heard your eldest daughter
got married.

634
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,200
So we came over to wish them all the best.

635
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,100
We didn't know about the wedding.

636
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,900
We also didn't know.

637
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,800
It goes fast nowadays.

638
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,300
Today they fall in love, tomorrow
they are married. Who will know?

639
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,600
Where is your brother-in-law?

640
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,300
Let's meet him.
He is here somewhere..

641
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,800
Here is our son-in-law.

642
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,100
What does he do?

643
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,300
Roasting..
Would you like something?

644
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,800
Talk too much...

645
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,800
Meet Manmohan, he is a 
big man in these parts...

646
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,300
His son...

647
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,800
In fact Balraj's eldest daughter was 
promised to his son.

648
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,600
But you married her.

649
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,300
I would like my son to marry 
your younger daughter, Urmila.

650
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,300
Talk to Balraj. I have no objection.

651
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,300
I object.
Why?

652
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,600
I choose myself who I married.
Urmila should also choose herself.

653
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,800
She won't marry Tom or Dick.

654
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,800
I will decide who she'll marry.

655
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,300
and if you have to marry...
I will ask my family..

656
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,100
Will that be okay, brother-in-law?

657
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,800
It is very hot here.

658
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,000
No danger.

659
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,800
Do you know, this is my favorite horse.

660
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,700
She is beautifull.
It is a horse.

661
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,300
You seduce the girl by using
the horse?

662
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,000
Why did you come here?

663
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,300
I've come to tell you the difference
between a horse and a donkey.

664
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,700
Don't try to bore me!
I don't try , I just do!

665
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:09,000
Do you think you are very strong?
Yes. Okay, let's see.

666
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,700
One hand is not enough?
I will put you in your place with one hand.

667
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,800
Hit me on my hand.

668
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,000
Hit very hard!

669
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,700
Put your hand up. Where?
It doesn't matter... on your face.

670
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,900
Why are you crying?

671
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,000
He hit me!

672
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,000
Uncle, we were just playing.
I hit and he started crying!

673
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,900
Tell me what happened.
You tell him.

674
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,000
He said, put your hand on your face.
I said, hit me.

675
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,400
When I hit him, he took away
his hand. Show him now.

676
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,700
This is exactly what happened.

677
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,100
Father! He hit me again!

678
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,400
Now I get it!

679
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,900
Now you hold your hand like that. My son
will hit. Where is the wall?

680
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,100
Hold your hand on your face.
My son will hit you.

681
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,100
It is important not only to have muscles,
but you need brains as well.

682
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,400
He has both, can be called
a complete man.

683
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,400
What are you thinking?

684
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,700
Nothing.
Tell me.

685
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,400
We played together when little children.

686
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:35,700
We shared everything, but you did not
tell me this news!

687
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,300
I wanted to tell you
when you would return.

688
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,100
Okay, tell me...
where did you meet each other?

689
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,100
How did you fall in love?

690
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,500
We met at his orphanage.

691
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,100
And since then love blossomed.

692
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,500
Then he left for New Zealand.
He came back a few days ago.

693
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,000
We got married in a temple,
out of fear for father's anger.

694
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,300
But at least you got the man
you love.

695
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,000
People deceive each other in love nowadays.

696
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,500
What are you talking about?

697
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:18,700
Nothing. If I understand well, 
you are talking about me.

698
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:23,900
She complained, that we didn't tell her
anything about us.

699
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,300
If you would have told her,
how would we have become one?

700
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,900
She would tell father and he would not
have let us gotten married.

701
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,200
But I met you in New Zealand.
I have known you.

702
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,500
Now we're togehter for life.
Take your time to get to know me.

703
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:39,500
It's about my sister, so
I worry about her.

704
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,500
But I know East Indians who marry here
and then go abroad..

705
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,500
..and pretend to be single and
then deceive other girls.

706
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:51,500
He is not one of them.
He called me every day from there.

707
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,000
Didn't you?

708
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,400
Did he?
I am in love.

709
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,500
I will never let go of the hand
of the one I love.

710
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:04,300
Just watch. You will know.
I have discovered that!

711
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,900
I have to go. I was the barrier between 
two lovers for a while.

712
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,900
Hug..?

713
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,300
Did I act ok?

714
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,500
Did I not overdo it?
No.

715
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,000
She is convinced,
we love each other.

716
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,300
Nothing can be done now.

717
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,600
Where will she sleep?

718
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,200
Where does Urmila sleep?

719
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,600
Good God! Don't leave me!

720
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,300
My throat has dried...

721
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,100
What is wrong?
Water.

722
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,100
Here..

723
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,600
Where is she?

724
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,400
Here she is.

725
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,700
Don't say anything.
Come quietly.

726
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,700
Come.

727
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,700
Don't let anyone see us.

728
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,700
Who is it? Who?

729
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:30,500
What's this. look at this..
The one you call son-in-law..

730
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,100
is having an affair with a servant.. !!

731
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:36,100
What?.. he is not with..

732
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,500
He will fall when he wakes up.
Fall when he wakes up!

733
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,400
Sleepwalking.
I don't know my way..

734
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:44,500
Wake up!

735
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,700
Dear girl, guide him to his room.

736
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,200
Me?
He will bump into something and fall.

737
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,200
He is falling!!!

738
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:58,400
Listen to me.

739
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,700
I won't listen..
Listen to me..

740
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,300
My love, listn to me.

741
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,100
Try guessing what is in my heart.

742
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,700
Care for me, love me.

743
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,300
Don't follow me around.

744
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,200
Break this false relation.

745
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:27,600
Don't give in and love me..

746
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:10,200
I enjoy teasing you.

747
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:24,700
Pray this joy will not become
a punishment for you.

748
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:29,300
Don't change your colors.

749
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:34,200
You will never make me yours.
Look, and don't be jealous of me.

750
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:38,900
You have conquered me with your beauty.

751
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:33,900
You will remember all your life.
I will treat you in such way..

752
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,700
I long to touch these pink cheecks...

753
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,600
I will show you the stars in daylight.
Don't deny your love.

754
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,600
Don't fight with me.
Let's go back to being friends.

755
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,900
Go away, don't come closer.
Don't try to talk big to me.

756
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,800
Listen to me.

757
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,500
Just listen to me. All your complaints
will be eliminated.

758
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,500
Let go of my hand!
Someone might see!

759
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,800
I was yours, am yours and
will always be yours.

760
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
you're making a mistake. I came here
for a good cause.

761
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,700
And I got stuck.

762
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
If Sharmila gets to know about us,
she will be hurt!

763
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,000
That is why I will get married
and leave this house!

764
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,500
Listen. I am not Sharmila husband.
I don't wanna hear!

765
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,500
I have no relatonship with Sharmila.

766
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:25,000
If you're not Sharmila husband,
what is your relation to Urmila.

767
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:29,700
Granddad..
I understand..

768
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,000
This is you..
Yes.

769
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,500
and this is Urmila.
Yes.

770
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,000
This is Sharmila.
Yes.

771
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,500
You love Urmila
Yes.

772
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,900
You came here as Sharmila's husband.
Yes.

773
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,000
Urmila's heart is broken.
Yes.

774
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,300
Nothing can be done.
It's not difficult for you.

775
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,100
Won't your son understand
when you explain it to him?

776
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,900
Me? Explain to him?
You want me to be beaten up?

777
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,600
Are you afraid for your son?
No, but I am for his gun!

778
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,900
Very shameful!

779
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:04,100
He is your son. Will he shoot you
when you tell him the thruth?

780
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,800
I know he is my son.

781
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,800
And he knows he is my son.

782
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:12,100
But does the gun know,
who the father is?

783
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,500
If it fires, I will die for nothing.

784
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,400
No, I can't do this.

785
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,500
What's your name?

786
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,900
Do you know what Singh means? Lion.

787
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,800
King of the animals.
You are a circus lion.

788
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,900
..that bows by the sound of the whip.

789
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:31,100
If you are a real lion, 
than go tell the hyena..

790
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:32,800
that you are the master of the house!

791
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:38,100
You encourage me.
No, it's the thruth.

792
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,900
I will bring down the house
with a roar!

793
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,500
Bring it down!

794
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,100
Shall I? Yes!
Shall I st an example?

795
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,600
Why is he yelling?

796
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:13,100
What's happening?
Don't you hear me calling you?

797
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,800
Come here.

798
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,500
What's up?
Look down and talk to me!

799
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,200
I had to accept a lot.

800
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,800
But not anymore.

801
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:31,100
One more word in a loud voice 
and I'll trhow you out!!

802
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:39,200
Are you drunk?
I was, but today I am sober.

803
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,000
You always ralk about family, honor
and power!

804
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:47,200
Do you ever think about people?
Do you care about them at all?

805
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:52,500
Do you know you're responsible 
for ruining Raju's life?

806
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,200
Speak up...
Shall I..?

807
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,800
Urmila loves Raju. 

808
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:04,200
Talk sense. Raju Sharmila's husband.

809
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,900
No, Sharmila's husband 
is someone else.

810
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,200
He cheateed on her,
and ran away.

811
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:14,200
She wanted to kill herself,
but Raju saved her life.

812
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:19,000
Out of fear for your anger, 
she brought him as her husband.

813
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,500
That's the truth!

814
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,500
Does father tell the truth?

815
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,200
Yes.
Did you hear?

816
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,200
Now I will decide.

817
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:41,000
Me..Vishwanath Pratap Singh!

818
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,700
The master of this house. Your father!!

819
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:50,200
I will give Urmila's hand in marriage
to Raju.

820
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:56,600
Come here.

821
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,900
Come here, child.
I'm here, come.

822
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,000
I am standing here.

823
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:13,300
Come.. come with me.

824
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:17,100
Come son.
Come out.

825
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:24,300
Here, take care of her.

826
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,300
Happy?
Yes.

827
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:35,100
I gave Urmila to him...
I have united them...

828
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,300
Will you only unite us in your dreams,
or also in real life?

829
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,100
Where is Urmila?
Inside.

830
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,800
I have united you both.
in your dreams.

831
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,700
Not in real life.

832
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,300
I will do this tomorrow.

833
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:55,300
Don't! The sleeping lion
awoke after years!

834
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,700
Today we won't spare him.
Come, let's go... granddad!

835
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:59,300
You go first. I will follow!

836
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,700
You come with me.
Absolutely!

837
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,300
We will wake him up!
Yes!

838
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,800
Why are you shouting?

839
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,800
I wanna have dinner.

840
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,300
Now?
No..

841
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,800
I wanna talk..
About what?

842
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,300
Wedding, wedding dress...

843
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:46,200
My hair grew long..
Which hair?

844
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,000
He beats his head.
Who?

845
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,800
He's gone.

846
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,400
He came back.
He does this..

847
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,900
I wanna play...
What are you doing?

848
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,400
Marriage..
I want to discuss something.

849
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:09,000
I wanna talk about marriage..
Whose marriage?

850
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,100
Mine ofcourse. Whose else?

851
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,000
What?
My brain doesn't work.

852
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,700
You could have asked Urmila first,
before you arranged her marriage.

853
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,400
I have announced my decision,
I did not ask your advice!

854
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,400
Whose marriage are you discussing?

855
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,900
Yours and Inder.

856
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:41,700
Listen carefully. Your refusal
won't change my decision.

857
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,100
There is no question of refusing.

858
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,400
You probably thought a lot
about the fate of your child.

859
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,800
What are you doing?

860
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,100
Who are you going to marry?
Why? What's wrong with him?

861
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,900
Nothing wrong, but also not good.

862
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:04,400
Your not good also. He has a house,
wealth and honor.

863
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,900
He has a family.

864
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:08,900
Don't follow me.

865
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,100
I mean, he is not right for Urmila.

866
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,900
Nor are you right for Sharmila.

867
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,400
In future you will not interfere
in our business.

868
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,000
Old man, this concerns my heart
and not your family.

869
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,500
Where did she go?

870
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,700
Granddad..
Yes?

871
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:40,300
Do you see that scarecrow?
Yes. The scarecrow.

872
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:45,000
Take it away and take its place.
At least you will scare the birds.

873
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,000
Talk with respect.

874
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,500
you did not give me the opportunity
to pay respect to you.

875
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,300
I thought you were the elder of the family,
but you are just old.

876
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,000
You're provoking me?

877
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,500
No, I dishonor you.
What?

878
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,100
Try to understand

879
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,000
What did you say your name was?
You forgot my name! Stone..

880
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,500
Yes, it's one or another lion.

881
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,800
Singh means lion.

882
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,200
But I don't understand, how you
turned out to be a circus lion.

883
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,200
you're unable to do anything.

884
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,500
Watch me and see what I'll do!

885
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,800
No, nothing needs to be done.
Just you watch!

886
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,300
Ok.
No, do something!

887
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,500
I can not do anything. You can.
I am old. you are not.

888
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,500
I am a circus lion.

889
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,500
You will give me a chance! You!!
Do something.

890
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,500
Come here.
Why did you bring me here?

891
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,400
I want to tell you a story.

892
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:45,900
Story?

893
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,500
A boy and a girl loved each other.

894
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,900
One day he saw a girl,
wanting to kill herself.

895
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,500
The boy saved her, and asked
why she wanted to kill herself.

896
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,900
She told him that the boy she loved,
had deceived her.

897
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,900
I can't face my family.

898
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,000
He felt sorry for her. He went to her house
as her husband.

899
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:17,000
But strange coincidence. That house
belonged to the girl he had loved.

900
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,200
This girl turned out to be the elder
sister of that girl.

901
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,000
This story sounds familiar.

902
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:32,200
Because I'm the boy, you are my beloved
and Sharmila the sister!

903
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,200
Yes, love, it is true.

904
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,200
He came here to help her.

905
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,300
Have some shame.
I'm standing here!

906
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,400
I am holding you after such a long time!

907
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,900
Don't you feel any shame?

908
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:52,200
The task of the homing pigeon is just to
deliver the letter and then leave.

909
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,900
Am I just the mailman? Then I will
take the letter back.

910
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,300
Don't!

911
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:59,100
I will turn away. Shameless!

912
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,300
Finished?
Not yet.

913
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:28,600
The girl has grown up.

914
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,300
She's friendly with me.

915
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:45,700
Everybody loves her.

916
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,700
She is the queen of all hearts.

917
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:05,700
The youth of this boy has blossomed.

918
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,700
He's the life of all pretty girls.

919
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:22,200
Everybody loves him.

920
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:28,400
He is the pride of all beauty.

921
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,700
Let me put a blush on your cheeks.

922
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,600
Let me lift those curls of yours.

923
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,100
Let me live my life in your arms.

924
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,600
I want to give you all my love.

925
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,400
I wanna hold you tight.

926
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,400
You are the words in my heart.

927
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,500
A little joy, a little fun.

928
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,800
None of it is my mistake.

929
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:28,300
My crazy heart is filled with love.

930
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,300
You also have intentions.

931
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:37,500
Your words scare me.

932
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:43,700
You are a little naughty.

933
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,600
Why do I talk to this iliterate?

934
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:38,900
You most likely do not know that ..
Guard ..what?

935
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:43,400
Guard? Shall I call the owner 
of this beautifull mansion?

936
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:44,900
Who are you?

937
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,900
How do you dare to ask me
for an introduction

938
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,600
I am a friend of Raju. Where is he?

939
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,200
He went to hell!

940
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:56,700
You cheap skate. Is that how you talk
about your master!

941
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:58,900
I will get you fired immediately!

942
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:01,400
I will clean you of this world!

943
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:03,700
He killed me!

944
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,900
Why did you come here?
I've told you not to come here!

945
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:11,600
Save me from this woman!
You rodent!!

946
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,100
Step forward!
Why? To be shot?

947
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,900
You won't escape.. !
He is my friend, Gopal.

948
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:18,700
We worked together in New Zealand.

949
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,800
Why didn' you tell that you have been
cooking together?

950
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,300
What's wrong?
We heard gun shots.

951
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:29,300
Look at this! There was one already, 
now another one popped up!

952
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,400
He is his friend.

953
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,600
They will make pav-vada and idli-bhajiya!

954
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,200
They will make our house
into a canteen!

955
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,400
The villagers were afraid 
to walk along our house.

956
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,300
Now they will sit here
and eat savories for a rupee!

957
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
What kind of guard is he?

958
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,800
You have the daghter of this clodhopper?

959
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
I'll tell you later. First let me introduce
you to grandmother.

960
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,500
Grandmother...

961
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
He always makes such mistakes.

962
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,300
Now, your sister-in-law.
Yes!

963
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:06,000
As if I don't know her.
Come, don't mess up.

964
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,800
She's my wife. How can she be
sister-in-law?

965
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I was dead, became a ghost.
was in the fridge and came out..

966
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I have danced..
Jet lag, he's not well..

967
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
I will take him inside
so he can recover. Come

968
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
don't you know...who is he?
His friend.

969
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,500
Do you know him?
Very well.

970
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,700
Dinner is lovely.

971
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,500
Do you like it? After so many days
I'm eating something good again.

972
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,700
Don't you know who cooked it?

973
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,400
Who?
We cooked it.

974
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:54,400
Our efforts paid off.

975
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,400
You cooked very nice.

976
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:05,000
I am very happy. Share this.

977
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:08,000
What are you doing?
He is our son-in-law.

978
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:12,500
I have tipped the cook,
not the son-in-law.

979
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:15,700
The cook of Mughal Hotel
also cooks very nice.

980
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:17,800
Does that mean, I also should accept
him as son-in-law?

981
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:21,000
you gave a 10 rupee tip.
At least eat the food.

982
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,700
When will this old man change?

983
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:27,500
This unfaithful cranny will never change.

984
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,100
unfaithful?
Yes, I added the salt myself.

985
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:33,600
I would have added 7 kilo's of salt
if I would have known him before.

986
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:36,400
He should receive a surprise visit
by the tax office.

987
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:52,900
Search the building.
Take all jewlery you can find.

988
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:54,300
Come.

989
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,200
Go to the stables.

990
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,300
Measure the horses.
Take a look at them.

991
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,400
Report everything.
But who are you?

992
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:04,600
Tax office. Understood?
but don't worry.

993
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,300
Take off all the jewlery you wear
and put it here.

994
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,100
Your watch too.

995
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:14,100
What's happening?
Who are you?

996
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:20,900
Who are we! Sardar Singh Ahluwalia!
Commissionar of the tax office! Understood?

997
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,200
Lower your tone! l can report you
for making tax rounds everyday..

998
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:28,200
on horse.

999
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:33,000
One question, what do you feed your horses?
Grass. I grows on the fields.

1000
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,400
The fields! How did you get them?
Inherited.

1001
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,000
Really? And this chain also?

1002
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,000
Don't you dare to touch me!

1003
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,900
Otherwise I'll shoot you!

1004
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:45,000
What brings you here?

1005
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:51,200
What are you doing here?
This friend has a large wealth.

1006
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,700
And he pays no income taxes!

1007
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:56,900
And he threatens
to kill a tax officer!

1008
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:00,100
Those two are my witnesses.
I will lock him away!

1009
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:02,200
He is my father-in-law.
Be quiet!

1010
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,700
Yes.
Yes?

1011
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:07,100
The friend of son-in-low! Be seated.
Take a cup of tea.

1012
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:11,000
No need. He's a friend.
Ahlu, go from here.

1013
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,500
As it is, they don't love me. After this,
they will start shouting at me.

1014
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,500
I will let you go 
if you apologize to Raju.

1015
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:25,700
Ok, if you don't wanna apologize,
a hig will also do.

1016
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,300
Balraj, what are you thinking?
Come on, hug him.

1017
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,200
Tell.

1018
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:36,000
He is an arogant men. I will erase
his vanity.

1019
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,800
Ahlu, you talk too much.
This is my chance.

1020
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,100
Let me talk!
He always puts me down!

1021
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,500
I cook for him, he calls me cook
and gives me a tipp!

1022
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:52,300
When I came her, he shot at me...
could have killed me!

1023
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:56,600
And he tells me to sell peanuts!
What do you think I am?

1024
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:58,400
Where did he go?

1025
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:05,300
Why are you shooting all the time?
Don't you have any sense of humor?

1026
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:08,000
I was just joking...
Hey, I'm leaving...

1027
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:20,300
Listen to my father-in-law...
I will beat you up...

1028
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:23,500
I will point the gun at you.

1029
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,000
You will suffer,
because you made me suffer.

1030
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:28,300
Don't you stare at me,
Don't shout at me...

1031
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,400
You are always fighting,
You are so arrogant.

1032
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:32,800
I will break you into three pieces!

1033
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:38,000
No fighting...

1034
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:42,500
Bring heart together with love.

1035
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,900
You saw me..
You know me.

1036
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,900
You know what my gun can do.

1037
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:07,200
Let me see, who can stand up to me.

1038
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:09,400
Don't stand in my way.
Don't try confronting me.

1039
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:16,200
He makes a fool out of you.
He makes you dance to his tune.

1040
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:21,400
Don't be...

1041
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:25,800
Go on, embrace him...

1042
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,300
Trying to call me?

1043
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,500
Are you trying to wake up a sleeping lion?

1044
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,700
you fox! You'll regret this.

1045
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:52,300
Try whatever you want...

1046
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,400
Today or tomorrow, you will bring me
a horse.

1047
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:56,900
You will ask me,
to dress as a groom.

1048
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:59,400
You will sing and dance,
when you accept me as son-in-law.

1049
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:03,600
You called me a fox.
you just slapped me.

1050
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,900
You shout..

1051
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:10,200
Nobody will save you.
I will kill you.

1052
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,400
TOday you will die!

1053
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,900
There is no way out.

1054
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:20,200
Don't let the gun go off...

1055
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:24,600
Not with your family

1056
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:45,000
What are you trying to prove?

1057
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:49,400
you want your daughter to become
a widow?

1058
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,500
We will tell the ..
aboriginals

1059
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:55,600
We will call the police..
We will send you to prison.

1060
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:58,000
You will end forever 
at the millstone.

1061
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:01,400
Millstone.

1062
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:09,800
Bloody old miser..
Giving me nightmares!

1063
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:12,900
Making me sweat!

1064
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:19,800
What are you doing here?
Nothing.. Thinking.

1065
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,400
You and thinking? What?

1066
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:26,600
Did you wash your son's face with glue
when he was little?

1067
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:29,400
Why?
His skin is stuck.

1068
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:31,900
Next to anger, he does not show
any other expression.

1069
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:35,000
He is the first man, who does not
know joy in life.

1070
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:38,500
Why don't you accept defeat?
It takes one final showdown...

1071
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:41,100
to decide on winner or looser.
That really won't happen here.

1072
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,300
Do you know how to handle a horse?
you want him to become cab driver?

1073
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:50,500
Prithvi Singh, the archery foe of Balraj.
His horses always win ..

1074
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:54,500
the yearly horse carriage contest.
Balraj's horses loose...

1075
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:59,500
If you could win the contest for him..
you will make him happy.

1076
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:03,100
Granddad.. in that case,
consider it done.

1077
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:06,200
Where are my father-in-laws horses?
Here.

1078
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:07,800
Horse? She is?

1079
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:23,500
The mare is alike his owner!

1080
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:26,500
Not easy to handle..
... is that tso?

1081
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:28,200
To hell with the bloody mare!

1082
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:37,100
Where is it now?

1083
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,200
Hey, did you see my horse?

1084
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,500
Yes, it is here.

1085
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:46,500
Go away. you won't get the horse.

1086
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,100
I won't get it... ?
As if his father ownes the horse.

1087
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:02,200
Thank you for keeping my horse.
This  female got lost...

1088
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:05,100
You can't take this horse..
Why not?

1089
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:11,500
Why only the horse? No intruder
ever leaves this place alive.

1090
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:13,800
I will,
and I will take the horse with me.

1091
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Tie this devils child up with the horse.

1092
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:25,500
Don't. Why don't you just give me the horse,
and spare yourself a beating...

1093
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:27,400
You want the horse?

1094
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:30,500
You want it?

1095
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,100
Keep it....

1096
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,300
What's happening?

1097
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:54,500
They refuse to give back
our horse.

1098
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,500
How dare you bring my horse here?

1099
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,100
I didn't. The horse threw me off,
and ran off, ending up here.

1100
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:03,000
Why do you sit on a horse,
if you don't know how to ride?

1101
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:06,900
Give me my horse.

1102
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,600
On two conditions.
Go ahead.

1103
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,600
One, if you win the chariots contest
this year...

1104
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:17,500
..you can take back the horse.
And secondly?

1105
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:24,100
You will have to apologize, 
for the behaviour of this young man.

1106
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:30,100
Shut up! If you try to offend me,
I am your worst enemy!

1107
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:34,800
You are very proud of your winning horses?
I will teach you a lesson!

1108
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,500
I will win the race this year
and give back the horse to uncle.

1109
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:41,100
Bravo, son!

1110
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:46,100
Did you see? It's in his genes.
An offence makes his blood boil.

1111
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:51,500
To me, you're the perfect son-in-law.
The day after tomorrow..

1112
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,400
... you'll be engaged to Urmila.
Ler's go.

1113
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:08,400
Is it time to come?
What can I do?

1114
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:10,700
I need to avoid father.
He can shoot me!

1115
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,500
What is he? A father or Satan?
What did you say?

1116
01:43:13,700 --> 01:43:15,700
When I say something nice about him,
why do I always end up..

1117
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:17,500
with things like this?
Things like...what?

1118
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:29,900
Here comes the donkey.

1119
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:31,500
Deal with him.

1120
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:38,200
What do you think about this?
..in preparation of the engagement..

1121
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:40,300
I want to give you this rose
and I wanna kiss you!

1122
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:44,600
Lights! Why do they need to go out
now? When will they be switched on again?

1123
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,800
After you're gone.
After I'm gone?

1124
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:50,600
But who said so?
Me.

1125
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:54,300
What happened to your voice?
The contamination of last night.

1126
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:58,800
I'm not paying attention.
I just wanna kiss you.

1127
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,700
First go clean your mouth.
How.. I can't see in the dark.

1128
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:04,600
Take a walk.
Where?

1129
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:06,500
Right, left and then just walk.

1130
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:09,200
Hold this flower.
Here, give it.

1131
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:12,800
Yes, go away.

1132
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,700
Urmila, it's very dark here.
Do as I tell.

1133
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,800
Walk on... a little to the right.

1134
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:25,200
A little to the left..

1135
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:28,700
And drop it.

1136
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,100
Done..

1137
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:33,600
Wash your face in the water.

1138
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:37,900
Don't get up yet.

1139
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:41,100
Crawl to me
if you wanna kiss me.

1140
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:45,500
Close your eyes and keep coming.

1141
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:50,500
Keep coming... a little to the left.

1142
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,300
a little to the left.

1143
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:56,200
Raise your head a littlebit.

1144
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,600
That's allright.

1145
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:01,800
Are lipps are just two 
thumbs away.

1146
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,200
Are your lips ingected?
Thery are swollen!

1147
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:22,900
Mare?

1148
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,200
What are you doing?
Kissing horses in the dark?

1149
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:35,000
No! l came here to kiss Urmila.
..but instead kissed a mare.

1150
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,300
I've never done this before.
I don't know how ..

1151
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:40,400
ldiot! Kissing is an art!

1152
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:43,000
Let me show you.
Urmila, come here.

1153
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:46,200
First, take the ladies hand.
No, not you... let me do it.

1154
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:49,700
So you take her hand, 
and pull her to you.

1155
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:51,700
Turn her around and
then kiss her!

1156
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:58,200
I understand! I've got it!
Did you understand?

1157
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:03,200
You've kissed my love!
Oh yes!

1158
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:09,800
How dare you make fun of my son?
Did you not tell him?

1159
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:13,200
Yes, last night I mistook a horse
for Urmila, and kissed it.

1160
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Then I told him, that kissing your
beloved is an art.

1161
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,900
And what did you say?
I said I didn't know..teach me how.

1162
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:23,300
And what did you show him?
I made a presentation.

1163
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,100
How..?
Put down the cup.

1164
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,200
Step back, please.

1165
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:28,300
I took Urmila's hand..
pulled her towards me..

1166
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,500
turned her around... 
and then kissed.

1167
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:32,400
Father! He kissed her again!

1168
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:37,400
Damn it! Why do you do that?
What's the problem?

1169
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:40,100
Last night I mistook a horse for
Urmila, and kissed it!

1170
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:43,100
I pitty the mare!

1171
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,800
What happened?
I told him that...

1172
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:51,100
..kissing your beloved is an Art.
Okay, and then?

1173
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:53,000
He said: I don't know...show me.

1174
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:55,100
And what did you tell him?
I took Urmila's hand...

1175
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:57,100
pulled her towards me..
turned her around..

1176
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:59,500
He kissed her again! Again!

1177
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,100
Why don't you hit him?

1178
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:02,400
Be quiet!

1179
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,200
Raju, what if you were my son?

1180
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,300
Why would I?

1181
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:12,900
No problem in presuming, is there?
Come here and stand next to me.

1182
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,400
Donkey! Come here!

1183
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Tell me what happened last night.
..I said, a horse instead of Urmila..

1184
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:20,200
and kissed her.
Correct. Then what?

1185
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:23,400
I told him kissing your beloved
is an Art.

1186
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:27,100
And then what did you say?
I said.. I don't know, show me.

1187
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,900
Now you, Raju.
What happened last nigt?

1188
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,500
Step back, please.

1189
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:34,900
I took Urmila's hand..
pulled her towards me..

1190
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,900
turned her around
and kissed.

1191
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:40,000
ldiot!

1192
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:50,900
Father, what's the problem?
I think..

1193
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:53,700
I just found out, that you think!
Keep quiet!

1194
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:58,700
This is giving me a headache.
Although he is Sharmila's husband...

1195
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:02,000
... I think Raju is having an affair
with Urmila.

1196
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,900
So what?
Urmila is the girl he will marry!

1197
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:08,100
What if the affair goes on after marriage...
Then what?

1198
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:10,400
We are worried
about the wealth ofThakur Sahib!

1199
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:13,800
God! I can't change this!

1200
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:20,600
But once Urmila is engaged,
I will take care of this Raju.

1201
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:01,100
Unmarried boys.

1202
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:03,200
full of expectation.

1203
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:05,900
Hearts beat faster..

1204
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:07,900
He says..

1205
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:10,600
This is the boy I want...

1206
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:32,600
Unmarried girls..

1207
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,900
full of expectation.

1208
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:42,100
This is the girl I want.

1209
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,700
You're torturing me.

1210
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:10,900
I can't bear it.

1211
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,400
I can not even tell you..

1212
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:15,700
How I long for your love..

1213
01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:24,500
This heartless world will kill us.

1214
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:29,000
Let them see us die
for each other.

1215
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:31,600
The moment I saw you..

1216
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:33,900
I said..

1217
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:36,300
... that's the girl I want..

1218
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:32,200
They built walls.

1219
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:34,400
They conspire against us.

1220
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:36,800
when lovers unite.

1221
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,400
everybody gets jealous.

1222
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:45,800
Don't bother about them.

1223
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:48,100
Let them do whatever they want.

1224
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:50,300
They can only be jealous.

1225
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:52,500
Let them burn in the fire
of their jealousy.

1226
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:55,200
When I found you....

1227
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:57,200
I said...

1228
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:59,900
This is the boy I want...

1229
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,600
Started... Here comes father!

1230
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:44,200
Who are you to advice me?
After all, you are my sister-in-law.

1231
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:47,800
What's happening?

1232
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,600
Ask him father, who is he
to interfer in our family business?

1233
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:53,400
I was telling her...
Keep your mouth shut!

1234
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:55,900
Go ahead, darling.
I said..

1235
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:59,800
..by marrying him, Sharmilla
damaged your honour.

1236
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:06,500
But I want to honor you.
When Inders horse will win..

1237
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:11,100
the whole village will celebrate you.
Only then, I will get engaged to Inder.

1238
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:17,900
That's my daughter! So concerned
about her fathers prestige!

1239
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:22,000
Why use a donkey as an opponent 
to a horse? You will be sorry.

1240
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:26,100
Shut up! The engagement will only happen
after the race.

1241
01:53:36,700 --> 01:53:39,600
welcome to the yearly races.

1242
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:43,500
The last 2 years, 
my horses won.

1243
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:47,600
And I am convinced also this year,
my horses will win.

1244
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:57,400
We will see after the race.

1245
01:53:57,500 --> 01:54:01,500
My son is competing 
fot the first time.

1246
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:20,700
That's our boy!
Keep looking.

1247
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:22,500
Keep looking!

1248
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:33,600
You, ... ? Go away from here.

1249
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:26,600
Seen? My boy!!

1250
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:30,600
Come on, son!

1251
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:42,600
Father! You ruined it for me!

1252
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:44,800
How will I now marry Urmila?!

1253
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:47,900
What did I do?!

1254
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:09,800
You cheat!

1255
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:27,200
Bravo, my son!

1256
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:29,800
Come, give me a hug!
The wonder of all wonders!

1257
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,400
You made Thakur Balraj Singh 
very proud!

1258
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:39,000
And I don't mind
admiting my mistakes in public.

1259
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:44,200
I never accepted
that Sharmila married you ...

1260
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:49,100
..I never accepted you as my son-in-law.
But I was wrong.

1261
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:55,600
Today, I tell everybody
that on Saturday...

1262
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:58,900
the marriage of Raju and Sharmila will
take place with all honors ..

1263
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:01,900
Everybody is invited.

1264
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:04,300
Bless you, son.

1265
02:00:10,100 --> 02:00:11,400
We are done!

1266
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:15,900
And what about the announcement of
Urmila's marriage with lnder?

1267
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:22,700
l can't approave of a fallen man
and looser as my son-in-law.

1268
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:35,500
You always wanted to knwo when I would be happy.
when I would smile.

1269
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:39,600
Look at me! I am happy!
But where is your smile?

1270
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:42,000
What is this smile?
Do I know that word?

1271
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,400
That's what I like most about you!

1272
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,700
Get ready, quickly!

1273
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:51,200
Why don't you help him dress?
There's a lot to do.

1274
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:55,900
Come and sit.

1275
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,900
Let me also help him.

1276
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:07,600
See how sweet she is?
Happy girl! She is the first girl..

1277
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:10,600
..that helps her lover
to marry her sister!

1278
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:13,900
What else should I do?
I don't understand anything!

1279
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:17,900
Don't pin your hopes on me.
I am a rusty old gun..

1280
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:21,200
.. without fire oin, only worth
to be hanged on a wall.

1281
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:28,400
What do you think to do?
I give you an idea.

1282
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:31,300
Elope with her.

1283
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:35,600
What are you saying, granddad?
What about your 400 year old inheritance?

1284
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:38,300
To hell with inheritance!

1285
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:42,100
And who should I give it to, untill
the 2 of you are married? Elope!

1286
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:46,200
No! we did not do anything wrong,
God will be on our side.

1287
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,500
God will certainly listen to us!

1288
02:01:49,300 --> 02:01:50,800
What is the problem now?

1289
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:53,700
God above heard everything!
What do you mean?

1290
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,700
Sharmila heard everything!

1291
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:16,100
What are you trying to do?
Are you crazy?

1292
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:18,100
Leave me alone! Let me die!

1293
02:02:19,900 --> 02:02:25,900
That is what I deserve. I was about
to rob my litle sister!

1294
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:30,900
I did this to see you happy
and for the honor of your family.

1295
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:33,800
And you here, you ruined everything!

1296
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,000
I am so unhappy, ain't it, Raju?

1297
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:44,400
It was my misfortune that he left me.
And now... .

1298
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:52,300
there is no chance that he will come back!
Show me the picture.

1299
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:57,100
Sharmila, I saw him somewhere..

1300
02:02:57,900 --> 02:02:59,900
was it at Prithvi Singh farm?

1301
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,400
That is his son.

1302
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:10,300
What is this whisering about?

1303
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:14,300
Discouraged?

1304
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:20,100
Get ready and come down.
The guests are arriving! 2 minutes.

1305
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:25,900
Granddad, we have very little time.
Take good care of my girl.

1306
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:29,100
I'll bring her husband. Whatever happens!
I'll come too.

1307
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:32,000
No granddad. What's the use of a gun
without bullets in a war?

1308
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:35,000
I am angry.

1309
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:37,300
Listen to me.. Raju!

1310
02:03:51,700 --> 02:03:55,400
You..? I was you somewhere.
Yes, I came for the horse.

1311
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:57,500
Come with me, I came for you.
For me?

1312
02:03:57,600 --> 02:04:00,000
Yes. This is a disgrace.

1313
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:02,700
Here you are... hiding away.
And sharmila is dying because of you.

1314
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:06,100
Do you know, she is carrying your baby.
How do you know Sharmila?

1315
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:09,900
I know all about you.
You know nothing.

1316
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:14,800
I love Sharmila very much.
But our fathers are enemies.

1317
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:18,800
He locked me up,
because I wanna marry Sharmila.

1318
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:21,400
You want to marry Sharmila?
Yes.

1319
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:24,100
That solves my problem. Let us go from here.
Where is the exit?

1320
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:28,900
Call the groom.
The auspicious time is passing.

1321
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:32,400
Father, callr, Raju.
Yes... immediately.

1322
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:36,200
Granddad, what will heppen now?
Don't worry.

1323
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:39,000
I have complete faith in Raju.
He will be here with Ajay..

1324
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:41,000
before the time has passed.

1325
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:49,000
Where are you going?
You can't stop me today, father.

1326
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:51,700
l am leaving!
And take him with me.

1327
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:56,500
You could not take the horse..
You think you can take my son?

1328
02:04:56,600 --> 02:04:58,800
Yes, I will and I know.

1329
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:02,000
and you hired bandits will try to stop me
and they will take a beating.

1330
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:04,500
And I know it, while you don't.
And tomorrow Sharmila will be...

1331
02:05:04,700 --> 02:05:06,900
called your daughter-in-law.
I know, but you don't.

1332
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:09,200
I will beat all the others, but I won't hurt you
since 

1333
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:14,000
you will be her fahter-in-law.
I just know that, you would not know!

1334
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,700
Come Ajay, let's go from here!

1335
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,500
Catch that scoundrel!

1336
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:31,200
Thakur Shahib, call the groom.
The auspicious time is passing by..

1337
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:33,900
Father, call Raju down.
Waht are you waiting for?

1338
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,900
He would come, if he was here.

1339
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:37,600
What do you mean?

1340
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:41,700
He fooled both your daughters,
and is now missing without a trace.

1341
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:47,100
What nonsense!

1342
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:50,200
What's the use of grabbing my collar?
It is the truth.

1343
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:52,200
He's lying. Raju is getting ready.

1344
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:55,200
What's taking so much time?

1345
02:05:55,900 --> 02:05:58,600
I will kill you!
Before you shoot...

1346
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:02,100
..why don't you look yourself?
ls he there? Or did he disappear?

1347
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:04,200
He's lying!
Stay quiet!

1348
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,900
Why are you mother? Ask around
where Raju is.

1349
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:27,600
Ask the one, who is carrying a baby out of 
this marriage. Ask your daughter.

1350
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:35,900
Ask the one who shared her lover 
with her sister. The younger one!

1351
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:42,600
Ask the one who guided your daughters.
Ask your father.

1352
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:44,800
He knew all along.

1353
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:06,400
The family, the honor, you were talking about.
It all got lost.

1354
02:07:06,700 --> 02:07:10,000
Who are you now gonna shoot, Thakur Sahib?

1355
02:07:57,700 --> 02:07:59,300
You drive without keys?

1356
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:05,800
Catch that scoundrel!

1357
02:08:31,700 --> 02:08:35,100
Even if you offer both your daughters to me,
I would never marry into this kind of family.

1358
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:37,400
Say something, father.
This can't be!

1359
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:41,900
You greet families with reputation.
lnstead of breaking bread..

1360
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:44,800
in the company of scandalous peolple,
I'll rather attend a funural!

1361
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,600
What honor do they have?
Let's go, people.

1362
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:15,800
Nobody ever before dared to point
one finger at my family,..

1363
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:20,600
The status of more than 400 year
had crumbled.

1364
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:24,400
For each member of the family,
this is the moment to die.

1365
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,300
This gun, I just carried it aroud in my arms.
I ahve never used it.

1366
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:34,100
Today I will and there will be dead bodies
everywhere... Only dead bodies!

1367
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
No!

1368
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:45,100
Ajay, ask your blessings.

1369
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:03,100
What are you waiting for?
Aim! And kill everyone!

1370
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:08,500
All your life you  have been sitting in your
ivory tower of false prestige.

1371
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:13,700
Do you see the result? Your children don't love you.
They are scared of you.

1372
02:10:14,700 --> 02:10:19,100
Had you loved them, instead of
pointing your gun at them...

1373
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:24,000
..you would not have had to see this day.
Raju is not Sharmila's husband.

1374
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,800
This is her husband, Ajay.

1375
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:36,300
Raju loves Urmila. Sharmila wanted to kill
herself, but Raju saved her.

1376
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:39,500
He pretended to be her husband
and came living with us.

1377
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:43,200
so people would not point a finger at you.

1378
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:46,400
ls this the way you pay him back?

1379
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:48,500
Granddad...
Let me speak, son.

1380
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:51,400
For the first time in my life,
I get the chance to be heard.

1381
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:54,500
No granddad, please keep calm.
I need to leave...

1382
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:58,500
Once I have left, there is nothing to be mad
about for him anymore.

1383
02:10:59,300 --> 02:11:01,200
Besides, I have fullfilled my tasks here.

1384
02:11:01,900 --> 02:11:06,500
And for an orphan like me,
these relationships have been wonderful.

1385
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:15,700
A granddad, a grandmother, a mother,
a good friend and even an anry father.

1386
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,800
But brfore I go, 
I will tell you something.

1387
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:21,700
Vishwanath Pratap Singh.
That is what you are.

1388
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:25,300
The lion!

1389
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,400
King of the wild!

1390
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:31,600
Not the one of the circus.

1391
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:54,300
Where are you going?

1392
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:57,100
When I arrived, you shot at me. 
Now that I'm leaving, you are still shooting at me!

1393
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:05,900
Nobody in our 400 year old heritage,
anyone left his lover

1394
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:10,900
Do you think you can leave Urmila now?
