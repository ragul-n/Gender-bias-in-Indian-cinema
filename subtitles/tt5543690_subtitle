1
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:05,820
Sir, Deva here!

2
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:07,643
Accident case, sir.

3
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:11,733
It happened in our area, I've
admitted victim in BGS hospital.

4
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,307
I'm little suspicious, can you
please come down here, sir?

5
00:03:14,897 --> 00:03:17,108
I'll be there immediately.

6
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:18,600
No need, I'll come.

7
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:42,362
When did the
incident take place?

8
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:43,886
When did it happen?-10:40

9
00:03:45,148 --> 00:03:46,364
A small collision, sir.

10
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:48,243
He came across the car.

11
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:49,889
Drunken driving?

12
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:53,410
Old aged man?

13
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:54,854
Critical stage.

14
00:04:06,436 --> 00:04:09,726
Sir, his name is Ganapathy.

15
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,337
He's security guard with FSL.

16
00:04:19,386 --> 00:04:21,416
A small bleeding in brain.

17
00:04:23,286 --> 00:04:25,259
Nothing can be said
as of now, sir.

18
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:32,412
Did you visit accident spot?

19
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:35,740
Car driver himself
brought him here.

20
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:40,005
Accident looks clean, sir
but I smell something else.

21
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,896
Is Jhansi in?- Yes, sir.

22
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:14,983
Ganapathy has been working
here for many years.

23
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:18,383
Such an incident never
happened earlier.

24
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:20,543
The only evidence we've got is
a phone call from Ganapathy.

25
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,022
What did Ganapathy tell?

26
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,299
He called us at 10:20. pm
just before accident,

27
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:28,221
he was very anxious,

28
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:31,299
he told us to send police immediately
and shouted about somebody.

29
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:34,882
When we tried to call him back,
he never attended the call.

30
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:38,588
May be he saw something there and
ran away outside in fear, sir.

31
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:40,309
What could it be?- No idea, sir.

32
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:43,565
Wasn't there anyone
else with him?

33
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,086
Since it was night shift,
only Ganapathy was on duty.

34
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:49,420
So, not many details.

35
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,952
Don't know what exact it is, but
there's something in this, sir.

36
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:59,882
There's link between strange incident that
happened here and Ganapathy's accident!

37
00:06:01,907 --> 00:06:04,441
A body went missing
from mortuary.

38
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:27,464
It was a female
body.Her name was Maya.

39
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:37,199
Who certified the
death certificate?

40
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:41,712
Other than forensic experts nobody
else touched this body, sir.

41
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,413
Did you inform Dr.Brinda?

42
00:07:09,932 --> 00:07:14,434
Due to disconnection in circuit all
cameras are switched off except one.

43
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,280
Ganapathy got scared
after seeing something.

44
00:07:21,386 --> 00:07:24,585
He entered as soon
as camera went dead.

45
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:33,379
He went inside to check
what had happened there.

46
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:39,998
Only this was recorded
after minutes, sir.

47
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,270
When all cameras went dead,
how could one camera be live?

48
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,302
Most probably they
may be here only.

49
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:56,149
Arrange security
around the campus.

50
00:07:58,392 --> 00:08:00,743
There must be a strong reason for
security guard to run in fear.

51
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,774
Someone may have
taken the dead body.

52
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:06,604
No chance, sir there's only one
way to enter the mortuary.

53
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:08,596
There's no other way.

54
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:12,479
We can't enter security room now, sir.
- Why?

55
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:14,760
Pass code is changed.

56
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:22,369
Called hackers team
to break the code.

57
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:29,471
Tell me details of
missing dead body.

58
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,218
She was chairman of
Pharmaceutico Pharmaceuticals.

59
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:36,562
MD Akshay Ramnath
is her husband.

60
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,320
Not only this, she had shares
in many other companies.

61
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:41,414
No heirs.

62
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:42,681
She had one elder and
one younger sister.

63
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:51,522
According to reports the dead Maya
has returned today from Los Angeles.

64
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:20,372
Play marriage band!

65
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:22,949
What's it, Maya?

66
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:25,750
I don't like you.I don't
like this marriage.

67
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:29,003
I arranged it after
you said yes, right?

68
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:30,538
It was then, not now.

69
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:39,311
All are watching us,
don't embarrass me now.

70
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:08,336
Only Maya could be so mischievous
even at times like this.

71
00:10:08,785 --> 00:10:13,585
She made everyone around her so
happy, should she meet such an end?

72
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:26,488
How is Akshay?- Akshay is
totally upset, father.

73
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:29,342
I feel very sad to see
him in this condition.

74
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,413
Please take care of him
till I come there.

75
00:10:31,524 --> 00:10:33,140
I'm here, father,I'll
take care of him.

76
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,165
Come soon.

77
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,206
Guests are leaving.

78
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:01,483
Shall I stay back?

79
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:04,977
No.

80
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:09,011
All of you go to
Sheetal's house.

81
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:14,114
Come back after Maya's body
reaches home after post mortem.

82
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:15,880
I'll stay back.

83
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,501
Please leave me alone
for some time.

84
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:01,274
Why did you come without
any information?

85
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:04,948
I couldn't stay alone there. That's
why I'm here.- No problem, right?

86
00:12:05,337 --> 00:12:06,970
I've fixed everything cleanly.

87
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,281
Everything for you only.

88
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:14,999
Shall we marry right now?

89
00:12:15,222 --> 00:12:17,890
Why urgency? I'm
here only, right?

90
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:21,644
Not just you, we both are
going to stay here only.

91
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:27,159
I feel like celebrating the
happiness that Maya's dead.

92
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:35,968
What do you want?
- Get me anything.

93
00:12:37,442 --> 00:12:40,632
If you give me poison
now it's nectar to me.

94
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:43,808
Then, I'll give you
that...deadly!

95
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:11,179
A thin line...

96
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:17,804
Sharply fell in my heart...

97
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,539
Time has ripened...

98
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:25,002
New vistas opened up...

99
00:13:25,027 --> 00:13:28,228
Brimming with truth...

100
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:34,905
Your shadow has turned real...

101
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:41,468
Shadow! Tell me, you're real...

102
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:50,024
Many a musical instruments
were silent till now...

103
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:56,831
It is playing music now...

104
00:14:56,856 --> 00:15:03,512
I'm carrying you, O my beauty...
Safely treasuring you like a book...

105
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:10,416
You appeared with dew
and entered my eyes...

106
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:16,473
I was waiting for this day...

107
00:15:16,686 --> 00:15:22,286
I was waiting in the
path for you...

108
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:36,702
Won't our hearts merge like darkness....
Won't my desires get fulfilled...

109
00:16:22,184 --> 00:16:24,960
Why don't you answer the call?

110
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,057
They're calling to
offer condolences.

111
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:29,102
Should I act if they feel sad?

112
00:16:29,477 --> 00:16:30,721
I'll act tomorrow morning.

113
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:36,392
Akshay, please answer the call.

114
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:41,694
I'm ACP Dev here.

115
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:44,069
Tell me, sir.

116
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:46,913
Can you please come
to forensic lab now?

117
00:16:46,978 --> 00:16:50,390
Why? I gave my statement to your
juniors today afternoon, right?

118
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,746
You gave statement but
this is different problem.

119
00:16:53,324 --> 00:16:54,363
What's the problem?

120
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,933
Your wife's body is missing
from FSL mortuary.

121
00:16:58,437 --> 00:17:00,813
What are you saying?

122
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,128
Body missing?

123
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:06,957
Are you playing game?

124
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:10,347
Why are you getting
tensed?Come immediately.

125
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:12,917
I'm too tired.I'll meet
you tomorrow morning.

126
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:15,980
If you don't come now,we may
have to come to pick you up.

127
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:19,160
No need, I'll be there.

128
00:17:24,504 --> 00:17:26,011
At this hour?

129
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:28,307
Maya's body missing.-
Maya's body missing?

130
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:30,211
Where? - How would I know?

131
00:17:30,236 --> 00:17:33,274
It is true that
she's dead, right?

132
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:37,641
I planned and executed it.

133
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:55,223
Do you've to go now?

134
00:17:55,628 --> 00:17:57,066
Don't go.

135
00:17:57,212 --> 00:17:59,441
Could it be police trap?

136
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:04,675
If I don't go now,
they may suspect me.

137
00:18:47,615 --> 00:18:51,311
Sorry for calling
you at this hour.

138
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:52,969
What's going on here, sir?

139
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:55,945
Prime report to us says your
wife's body is missing.

140
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:59,678
How could it happen here?
Isn't there security here?

141
00:18:59,896 --> 00:19:01,399
Yes, a security guard
Ganapathy was here.

142
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:04,254
But he has met with an accident.

143
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,982
Accident? - Yes.

144
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:07,529
I think he saw your wife's
body being taken away.

145
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:10,450
He ran away in fear and
met with an accident.

146
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,419
He's in coma in BGS.

147
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,936
I really can't understand
what you're trying to say!

148
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,736
How can it happen in a
place like this?

149
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:21,205
Actually incident like this
had happened earlier too.

150
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,394
Like drug trafficking,
organ trafficking.

151
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:27,114
They steal dead bodies and
sell the stolen organs.

152
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:30,075
If so, they'll not steal
just one body.

153
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:33,417
Is your wife having any enemy?

154
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:34,877
No...no...Maya has no
problem with anyone.

155
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:38,402
From you?

156
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:46,839
I mean your enemy...
to trouble you...

157
00:19:46,864 --> 00:19:47,720
May hurt her...

158
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,262
Nothing like that, sir.

159
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:52,743
To disturb your family peace...
- Ask family members.

160
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:55,793
Then her sisters...
- We inquired them.

161
00:19:57,043 --> 00:19:58,523
They say nothing like this.

162
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:03,398
Your wife's life is insured
for Rs.10 crores.

163
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:04,471
You're the nominee.

164
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:09,213
Moreover for her property and
shares, there's no one else.

165
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:11,885
It's just you.

166
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:14,263
May be someone doesn't want
it to come to you...

167
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,123
I don't think there's
anyone like that.

168
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:20,564
Is there any problem with
your land line phone?

169
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:22,498
No, sir.

170
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:25,552
I called your land line,
nobody answered it.

171
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:30,208
Then, we called your sister to get
your personal number to call you.

172
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:32,690
Were you not in house then?

173
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,172
I went out to buy pain
killers for head ache.

174
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:44,617
You own such a large pharmaceutical company
but went out at mid night for tablets...

175
00:20:45,337 --> 00:20:46,362
I'm surprized.

176
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,854
I'm little tired.But okay.

177
00:20:55,043 --> 00:20:58,284
Sir, Dr.Brinda is here.

178
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,123
Found anything about
missing Maya's body?

179
00:21:45,202 --> 00:21:47,061
No. - Tell me the truth.

180
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:48,343
No!

181
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:49,264
Listen carefully without
getting tensed.

182
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:50,365
What's it, Akshay?

183
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,100
It seems an incident has
happened in mortuary.

184
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,307
Guard who saw this ran out in
fear and met with an accident,

185
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,390
he's now in BGS,

186
00:21:56,656 --> 00:21:58,330
I don't believe whatever
the police say,

187
00:21:58,355 --> 00:21:59,491
you go there and confirm
it immediately,

188
00:22:00,097 --> 00:22:01,245
Security guard's name
is Ganapathy.

189
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:07,229
You've contacts in all hospitals, right?
Why not inquire about Ganapathy yourself?

190
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:08,828
I can't go out from here.

191
00:22:08,956 --> 00:22:12,056
What happened? Did
they arrest you?

192
00:22:12,493 --> 00:22:14,444
No, just an inquiry.

193
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:16,201
You check and call me.

194
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:40,009
You can't smoke here.

195
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,759
Forensic expert is
waiting outside.

196
00:22:51,845 --> 00:22:53,429
According to your statement,

197
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:56,122
your wife came back from Los
Angeles today morning, right?

198
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:57,335
Yes, doctor.

199
00:22:57,773 --> 00:23:01,030
I think she's scared of
flight journey, right?

200
00:23:01,685 --> 00:23:05,060
She even tried meditation
to overcome this fear.

201
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:11,035
It's common to get heart attacks
during long flight journey.

202
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:14,340
Yes, there's chance.

203
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,349
Did she have any heart
attacks earlier?

204
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,005
No, doctor.

205
00:23:20,822 --> 00:23:24,713
There's no way she can
get heart attacks.

206
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:31,401
We can say surely only after her
post mortem reports are ready.

207
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:34,401
Did she have any Parkinson’s problem?
- No, doctor.

208
00:23:36,088 --> 00:23:38,436
Schizophrenia? - No, doctor.

209
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:40,981
Did she have fits?

210
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:43,233
Family doctor gave you her
medical records, right?

211
00:23:43,258 --> 00:23:45,491
Why are you asking me
so many questions?

212
00:23:45,516 --> 00:23:48,298
Okay, there are records but is
doctor's living with her?

213
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:50,290
You're living with her, right?

214
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:56,306
There's chance that many things happen in
home which may not be in medical records.

215
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:58,202
You may know about it.

216
00:23:58,227 --> 00:24:01,319
As her husbandtell me if
there's anything like that.

217
00:24:01,694 --> 00:24:06,140
You know why I'm asking you this, I
suspect it could be catalepsy.

218
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:08,574
Catalepsy? What does it mean?

219
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:12,605
It means...a machine sometimes
shuts down immediately,

220
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:16,810
our heart too stops
working suddenly,

221
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:20,410
at times it may start
working again,

222
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:22,993
you may have seen this
news in paper or on TV,

223
00:24:23,018 --> 00:24:26,594
about dead people coming
back alive suddenly,

224
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,924
Is there any chance Maya
may have regained life?

225
00:24:31,004 --> 00:24:32,789
There is every chance.

226
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,268
Is there any possibility
of happening this?

227
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:52,659
If she did, Maya should've
yelled for help.

228
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:57,191
How can Maya's body go
missing from here?

229
00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:00,225
If we think logically someone
should've taken away the body.

230
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,886
I too think so.

231
00:25:05,526 --> 00:25:06,491
Who would benefit from this?

232
00:25:07,683 --> 00:25:12,483
According to forensic science, every death
is murder until it is proven otherwise.

233
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:15,454
No.

234
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:20,774
We can induce heart attack
with stress and drugs.

235
00:25:21,477 --> 00:25:24,086
But it can be found only
in post mortem.

236
00:25:25,808 --> 00:25:29,017
So, we need body for post mortem.

237
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:38,271
How was his behaviour when
you talked to him?

238
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:47,099
How can he be?

239
00:25:49,337 --> 00:25:51,068
Even after years of
my wife's death,

240
00:25:51,741 --> 00:25:54,349
I'm unable to forget her
for a day or moment.

241
00:25:56,192 --> 00:25:58,248
His wife is dead for
just  hours only.

242
00:25:59,443 --> 00:26:00,899
Body is missing too.

243
00:26:00,924 --> 00:26:02,257
How cool he is!

244
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:34,574
It's been long time
since I saw you.

245
00:26:34,683 --> 00:26:36,095
How are you doing, Shakthi?

246
00:26:39,573 --> 00:26:42,196
How is your daughter Amrutha?

247
00:26:42,449 --> 00:26:46,073
She's fine. She's doing
IPS in Delhi.

248
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:48,652
So far?

249
00:26:49,226 --> 00:26:51,433
Don't you find difficult
to live alone?

250
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,142
Difficult...my daughter
too is just like me.

251
00:26:56,337 --> 00:26:58,766
It was my wife's wish that she
becomes a police officer.

252
00:26:59,442 --> 00:27:01,228
She'll back after
training shortly,

253
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,426
I'll arrange lunch,
please do come.

254
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:06,739
I'll definitely come.

255
00:27:12,283 --> 00:27:13,723
Keep this carefully.

256
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,894
Where are you going?

257
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,194
Where are they?
- Please be seated inside.

258
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:21,995
Please don't come out.

259
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:24,329
Do you know what the time is now?

260
00:27:24,531 --> 00:27:26,227
You know my situation, right?

261
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:28,688
Why are you wasting my time
making me sit there?

262
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:32,223
Please be calm, DCP
is investigating.

263
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,992
Body is missing, you're
investigating.

264
00:27:35,017 --> 00:27:36,274
What would I do sitting here?

265
00:27:36,345 --> 00:27:38,108
Call your boss, I need to go home.

266
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:48,069
Akshay, please sit inside.

267
00:30:53,948 --> 00:30:55,197
Where's your glass?

268
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,604
Early morning at  AM?

269
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:04,862
Must celebrate US tour
success, right?

270
00:31:06,295 --> 00:31:07,804
Get your glass.

271
00:31:08,012 --> 00:31:11,422
After I'm back from office,
we've the whole night.

272
00:31:12,577 --> 00:31:14,916
I must go to lab.

273
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:22,012
I returned home today only.

274
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,230
Why are you leaving
me alone in home?

275
00:31:24,947 --> 00:31:27,043
I've an important appointment.

276
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:28,942
I know you're Company's director.

277
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:34,255
Nobody has any right to object you from
taking any number of holidays.

278
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,052
Except me.

279
00:31:37,077 --> 00:31:39,533
You know very well about me, Maya.

280
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,816
Whatever I do, I always
do it sincerely.

281
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:00,930
What are you saying, Maya?

282
00:33:03,223 --> 00:33:05,141
I've decided to fire him.

283
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,725
Type Akshay's termination
letter immediately.

284
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,937
Don't play, Maya. I said
I need to go to lab.

285
00:33:18,335 --> 00:33:19,935
This is my company.

286
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,794
I've plenty of work in office.

287
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:38,758
I'm your wife.

288
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,611
The only job you've now is...

289
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:43,748
To be with me only.

290
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:45,919
You're free now.

291
00:33:56,678 --> 00:33:57,803
What?

292
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:08,092
You're still like a child!

293
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:10,554
I didn't make any call.

294
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:19,319
Come home early tonight.

295
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,403
Let's go out for dinner.

296
00:34:21,428 --> 00:34:22,552
You'd be asleep.

297
00:34:24,004 --> 00:34:26,607
I mean you travelled
over 10  hours.

298
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,343
Better you sleep.

299
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:35,226
You're coming, you're
taking me out.

300
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,023
What are you doing here?

301
00:34:57,202 --> 00:34:59,000
I heard noise, so I came here.

302
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:03,062
Fuse was off, they rectified it.

303
00:35:14,878 --> 00:35:16,514
How come the locker is open?

304
00:35:20,437 --> 00:35:21,749
How did the box in
locker reach here?

305
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:26,397
We kept Maya's belongings
in this box.

306
00:35:26,422 --> 00:35:27,595
Check thoroughly.

307
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:33,962
Cell phone is missing.

308
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,143
I didn't take it.

309
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,486
Did any corpse here take it away?

310
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:44,033
If you had taken, please return it.
- Why would I take Maya's phone?

311
00:35:47,475 --> 00:35:49,793
Take it out.

312
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:51,059
Take it out.

313
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:52,951
Empty your pockets now.

314
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:07,812
My phone.

315
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:11,423
That's all?

316
00:36:16,732 --> 00:36:17,609
What?

317
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,813
Do what I said!

318
00:36:19,415 --> 00:36:20,773
Why? - I need to search you.

319
00:36:23,494 --> 00:36:25,328
I came here just like that...

320
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:27,570
You're doing the wrong thing.

321
00:36:27,784 --> 00:36:29,683
Please listen to me.

322
00:36:32,216 --> 00:36:33,621
Please listen to me.

323
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:48,446
What's this?- I don't know.

324
00:36:48,677 --> 00:36:50,189
I found it on floor, I
kept in my pocket.

325
00:36:50,214 --> 00:36:52,061
Will you keep in pocket
whatever you find on floor?

326
00:36:52,304 --> 00:36:54,089
It has your company label too.

327
00:36:55,468 --> 00:36:58,331
My company supplies to many hospitals.
It could be one of them.

328
00:37:02,478 --> 00:37:04,140
It's a toxin.- What type of toxin?

329
00:37:04,165 --> 00:37:05,981
I don't know.- What
for they use it?

330
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:08,575
My company manufactures many toxins,
I'm not an expert on this.

331
00:37:08,745 --> 00:37:11,278
I don't know anything about this.

332
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:27,798
Call from my sister.

333
00:37:31,942 --> 00:37:35,353
Tell me, Anitha.
- Akshay, I'm outside the hospital.

334
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:38,986
The name of guard is Ganapathy, right?
- Yes.

335
00:37:39,643 --> 00:37:41,729
Police information was right.

336
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:43,565
He has been admitted here.

337
00:37:43,682 --> 00:37:45,790
Maya's body is still missing, I
think police will find it soon.

338
00:37:45,815 --> 00:37:48,553
Are you facing any problem there?

339
00:37:49,585 --> 00:37:50,536
I'll call you later.

340
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:52,245
Why are you changing my name?

341
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:55,432
Is anyone there with you?

342
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:00,310
Is your inquiry over?

343
00:38:02,391 --> 00:38:03,376
I'll take leave now.

344
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:04,873
You can after giving
final statement.

345
00:38:06,377 --> 00:38:07,580
Can I at least use rest room?

346
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:24,661
I'll wait outside.

347
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:36,670
Tell me, Akshay.

348
00:38:36,827 --> 00:38:38,342
I don't have time to
talk to you, Bhoomi.

349
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:40,318
Give me details about
security guard.

350
00:38:40,343 --> 00:38:43,349
He's still in coma, not yet
regained consciousness.

351
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:49,138
Something went wrong here.
Somebody knows our plan.

352
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:52,202
They opened mortuary locker
and took away Maya's phone.

353
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:54,283
What are you saying?

354
00:38:54,613 --> 00:38:56,265
I don't get you.

355
00:38:56,433 --> 00:39:00,085
Not only that BL bottle is here,
which I hide it elsewhere.

356
00:39:00,614 --> 00:39:02,670
Only we both know about this.

357
00:39:03,178 --> 00:39:05,602
Did you talk about
this with anyone?

358
00:39:07,551 --> 00:39:10,846
Is it something I can
discuss with other people?

359
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:14,257
Who else do I know
here other than you?

360
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:16,973
Are you suspecting me, Akshay?

361
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:20,637
Something is going on here, our
plan mustn't fail at any cost.

362
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:22,198
I don't know what to do.

363
00:39:22,832 --> 00:39:24,887
When will you be back?

364
00:39:24,912 --> 00:39:26,547
I'm scared.

365
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,628
Leave the place immediately.

366
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,087
I'll take care of body matter.

367
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:54,065
It's late night,
you go home, sir.

368
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,357
I'll handle this case.

369
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,333
No, this case is
little complicated.

370
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:03,358
Better if I'm here
till we find the body.

371
00:42:44,557 --> 00:42:46,357
Why are you so late, Akshay?

372
00:42:47,326 --> 00:42:49,724
A small issue in lab.

373
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:54,709
I called lab.- I went
out to get samples.

374
00:42:58,669 --> 00:43:01,755
I kept phone in my briefcase.

375
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,914
Sorry Maya, I didn't
pick up your call.

376
00:43:16,037 --> 00:43:18,061
What's this fold
under your eyes?

377
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,153
Never saw it.

378
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:24,553
You too got one just like mine.

379
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:26,612
I think I've grown old.

380
00:43:31,477 --> 00:43:34,979
Already we're late, come
let's go to dinner.

381
00:43:35,128 --> 00:43:38,104
Wear my favourite blue suit.

382
00:43:38,893 --> 00:43:40,323
You look very handsome in it.

383
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:44,801
No, I've bought a new black suit.
I'll wear that.

384
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:07,784
I've grown old, right?

385
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:09,986
Everyone grows old.

386
00:44:10,011 --> 00:44:12,962
I appear little over aged.

387
00:44:12,987 --> 00:44:17,228
That's why you've started
coming late to home.

388
00:44:20,028 --> 00:44:21,690
I'm scared, Akshay.

389
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,458
I fear you may leave me.

390
00:44:25,156 --> 00:44:26,652
You won't leave me, right?

391
00:44:27,015 --> 00:44:28,372
Why do you think
like that, Maya?

392
00:44:28,397 --> 00:44:30,973
Whenever I hear this
song, I feel like that.

393
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:34,298
Why do you listen to it then?

394
00:44:34,323 --> 00:44:39,782
The way you're behaving with me makes
me listen to that song quite often.

395
00:44:42,185 --> 00:44:45,364
Maya, I'll not leave you.

396
00:46:23,384 --> 00:46:24,798
Are you done? What
are you doing?

397
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:25,791
I feel like throwing up.

398
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:28,083
Come quickly, we found a clue.

399
00:47:00,169 --> 00:47:01,599
What are you doing?

400
00:47:02,077 --> 00:47:03,101
What are you doing?

401
00:47:03,898 --> 00:47:05,194
Are you smoking cigarette?

402
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,234
No...just a minute...

403
00:47:07,267 --> 00:47:10,851
Sir wants you there,
come quickly.

404
00:47:18,828 --> 00:47:20,228
Come out quickly.

405
00:47:34,734 --> 00:47:37,360
What's the clue?
- DCP sir will tell you.

406
00:47:39,113 --> 00:47:41,032
It never happened
like this earlier.

407
00:47:41,057 --> 00:47:43,032
Despite so much security...
- What you say is not right?

408
00:47:43,467 --> 00:47:44,771
Have you opened the lock?

409
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:47,561
Lock is opened, DCP
wants you there.

410
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:49,602
Why did you bring me here?

411
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:52,923
Sir called you.

412
00:48:00,155 --> 00:48:03,022
Where's your sir?- He's inside.
You go.

413
00:48:29,662 --> 00:48:31,998
Entire building's CCTV
is controlled from here.

414
00:48:38,402 --> 00:48:42,498
This air duct goes to
roof, they broke it open,

415
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,508
using it as fox hole,
they entered the room.

416
00:48:46,897 --> 00:48:50,897
They cut the camera circuit
and stole your wife's body.

417
00:49:02,915 --> 00:49:04,376
Do you get anything from it?

418
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:06,344
No. - Why?

419
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:11,461
Look, they changed
the date also.

420
00:49:14,063 --> 00:49:16,708
People who stole your wife's
body must have done this.

421
00:49:17,803 --> 00:49:22,817
This is secure door,
it has pass code.

422
00:49:32,121 --> 00:49:34,053
Control panel has
been manipulated.

423
00:49:34,774 --> 00:49:37,046
Pass code has been
changed tonight only.

424
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:39,859
Do you know the pass code?

425
00:50:43,526 --> 00:50:46,156
What are you doing here, Maya?
- I came here to meet you.

426
00:50:47,425 --> 00:50:50,874
Ragini opened the door for me.
Don't scold her.

427
00:50:52,567 --> 00:50:54,187
You were supposed to come tomorrow.
- Finished my work in just one day.

428
00:50:54,212 --> 00:50:58,234
I couldn't stop myself
from without seeing you.

429
00:51:08,562 --> 00:51:10,026
I saw your password.

430
00:51:13,963 --> 00:51:15,059
Are you following me?

431
00:51:15,234 --> 00:51:16,354
Forget it.

432
00:51:16,512 --> 00:51:19,008
Why are you using
dates for password?

433
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:21,609
How do you know it is date?

434
00:51:22,085 --> 00:51:25,203
Darling, all your
passwords are dates.

435
00:51:26,439 --> 00:51:30,141
The day we've a fight, you
use that date as password.

436
00:51:30,961 --> 00:51:32,056
Why?

437
00:51:33,147 --> 00:51:34,142
To remember it.

438
00:51:35,845 --> 00:51:37,973
It's better to
forget few things.

439
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:41,578
I like to keep memories.

440
00:51:57,411 --> 00:52:00,151
I'm hungry, shall
we go for lunch?

441
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:04,294
I'm not hungry.

442
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:08,847
I'm hungry, won't
you take me out?

443
00:52:09,428 --> 00:52:10,550
You should've told me earlier.

444
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:15,878
Should I take your appointment
to have lunch with you?

445
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,053
Finish your work and come.

446
00:52:23,775 --> 00:52:24,943
Okay.

447
00:52:27,935 --> 00:52:29,911
Let's go out for lunch.

448
00:52:29,936 --> 00:52:31,184
Shall we go in your car?

449
00:52:37,106 --> 00:52:38,418
What are you doing, Maya?

450
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,374
Shall we go on a drive?

451
00:53:10,433 --> 00:53:13,583
There's no doubt they used
this lift to take the body.

452
00:53:15,034 --> 00:53:16,650
But we've to find who did it?

453
00:53:17,126 --> 00:53:18,428
Got any clue?

454
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:23,443
Got information about footprints on staircase
leading from emergency to roof top.

455
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:29,839
What's your shoe size?

456
00:53:29,864 --> 00:53:31,664
What's your shoe size?

457
00:53:46,052 --> 00:53:47,668
Power trip, sir.We're
checking, sir.

458
00:53:48,492 --> 00:53:50,381
Fire alarms are switched on.

459
00:53:50,406 --> 00:53:51,828
Water sprinklers are open.

460
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:54,859
We're checking for the fault.

461
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:57,515
Everything will be ready
in few minutes, sir.

462
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,679
Let's wait in reception
till they get ready this.

463
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:20,952
I can't talk to you, Bhoomi,
don't call me again.

464
00:54:21,312 --> 00:54:22,688
Someone has used the date
we met as pass code here.

465
00:54:22,713 --> 00:54:24,947
Bhoomi, please listen...

466
00:54:26,254 --> 00:54:30,478
What happened, Akshay?

467
00:54:37,464 --> 00:54:39,683
Can you hear me, Akshay?

468
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,797
Some has used the date we
met as pass code here.

469
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:11,562
Listen to me, Bhoomi...

470
00:55:38,529 --> 00:55:41,995
What happened, Akshay?

471
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:43,843
Maya is still alive.
- Still alive?

472
00:55:45,139 --> 00:55:46,555
Yes, plan has misfired.

473
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:47,906
She's playing with me.

474
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:50,062
She's alive, Bhoomi.

475
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:52,750
Maya has seen the
message you sent me.

476
00:55:52,815 --> 00:55:55,351
How can she see now the
message I sent you long back?

477
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,992
Maya knows what we both
had done together.

478
00:55:58,017 --> 00:55:59,609
She'll not spare you.

479
00:55:59,634 --> 00:56:03,090
She's playing a drama here that I'm
responsible for her body going missing.

480
00:56:03,783 --> 00:56:06,711
Moreover Maya is not
alive as per records.

481
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:09,363
She can do anything.
Nobody can harm her.

482
00:56:09,518 --> 00:56:10,285
Got it?

483
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:12,199
I'm scared.

484
00:56:12,334 --> 00:56:14,199
We don't want anyone's property.

485
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,768
I want only you.

486
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:19,432
Don't get tensed,
I need to go now.

487
00:56:20,165 --> 00:56:21,978
I'll call you myself
after sometime.

488
00:56:37,037 --> 00:56:38,693
I think it's your
sister on phone.

489
00:56:39,356 --> 00:56:40,817
Yes, sir.

490
00:56:40,936 --> 00:56:43,442
She wants me to go home
because it's too late.

491
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,457
Give me the phone.

492
00:56:47,702 --> 00:56:48,575
Why?

493
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,467
Let it be with me
till inquiry is over.

494
00:57:07,502 --> 00:57:09,838
We're watching his movements.

495
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,305
He made calls from his phone.

496
00:57:12,776 --> 00:57:14,352
All calls were to
the same number.

497
00:57:14,907 --> 00:57:16,586
That phone is also
on his name only.

498
00:57:16,611 --> 00:57:20,187
Why didn't you trace
that call then?

499
00:57:20,389 --> 00:57:23,045
We'll trace out as
soon as possible, sir.

500
00:57:24,062 --> 00:57:26,718
Sir, we've activated
security cameras.

501
00:57:27,344 --> 00:57:29,848
Don't know who but they've
switched on fire alarms.

502
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:33,090
Found this cigarette butt
near wash room sensor.

503
00:57:36,784 --> 00:57:38,492
He was smelling cigarette.

504
00:57:40,454 --> 00:57:41,743
Look at this!- Tell me.

505
00:57:41,768 --> 00:57:43,611
BL report is here.

506
00:57:43,636 --> 00:57:46,845
It seems this medicine is used
rarely to induce cardiac arrest.

507
00:57:48,042 --> 00:57:51,587
If anti-dose is not given within
hours, sure to get heart attack.

508
00:57:51,814 --> 00:57:55,006
After that nobody can prove
what lead to heart attack.

509
00:57:55,562 --> 00:57:56,150
How?

510
00:57:56,175 --> 00:57:59,311
Once it mixes with blood,
it dissolves completely.

511
00:58:09,484 --> 00:58:10,484
Get FIR ready.

512
00:58:12,627 --> 00:58:15,316
Lock him in room with camera.
Observe all his movements.

513
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:21,199
Maya?!

514
01:03:51,433 --> 01:03:52,433
Who is it?

515
01:03:52,693 --> 01:03:54,209
Maya? Who is it?

516
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:56,730
Who are you? - I'm Pavithra.

517
01:03:56,804 --> 01:03:58,900
From Move & Pick restaurant.

518
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,209
Somebody left this phone here.

519
01:04:01,234 --> 01:04:03,370
Pavithra, that phone
belongs to my wife.

520
01:04:04,183 --> 01:04:06,076
I and Maya visit your
restaurant quite often.

521
01:04:06,101 --> 01:04:08,748
I'm Akshay here.-
Is it you, sir?

522
01:04:10,963 --> 01:04:12,115
Please tell me, sir.

523
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:13,505
How did you get this phone?

524
01:04:13,658 --> 01:04:15,942
She forgot the
phone in bathroom.

525
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:18,372
Found it while cleaning it.

526
01:04:18,397 --> 01:04:20,453
When? - May be hour back.

527
01:04:20,831 --> 01:04:22,770
If so, did Maya come there?

528
01:04:22,795 --> 01:04:25,255
Madam may have come
but I didn't see her.

529
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,283
Why did Maya go there?

530
01:04:32,967 --> 01:04:36,517
Can you please check the call
list and tell who had called her?

531
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:41,780
Call list is empty but call is
connected through conference call.

532
01:04:41,805 --> 01:04:43,138
Conference call?

533
01:05:04,451 --> 01:05:06,226
We didn't order wine.

534
01:05:08,444 --> 01:05:10,561
You're our regular
customer, right?

535
01:05:10,586 --> 01:05:12,408
So, this is complimentary
drink from us.

536
01:05:20,551 --> 01:05:23,116
Can I know what this
celebration is for?

537
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:26,194
I've signed new
business agreement.

538
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:31,319
I'm going to Los
Angeles in weeks.

539
01:05:34,325 --> 01:05:36,357
You achieve whatever
you think, right?

540
01:05:39,912 --> 01:05:42,829
Why don't you also
join me to US trip?

541
01:05:42,931 --> 01:05:47,149
I'll not get scared if you
travel along with me.

542
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,559
I've got everything ready
to register a new patent.

543
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:02,458
Just a minute.

544
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:51,916
Who is he?
- You don't need to know.

545
01:06:52,988 --> 01:06:54,985
I think you were
talking about me.

546
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:56,903
I don't like to
tell you about it.

547
01:06:57,356 --> 01:06:59,038
Tell me.

548
01:06:59,063 --> 01:07:01,629
If I tell, you may regret.

549
01:07:01,812 --> 01:07:03,188
He's my lawyer Krishna Prasad.

550
01:07:04,371 --> 01:07:05,520
Lawyer?

551
01:07:08,137 --> 01:07:10,020
Isn't your sister
Sheetal your lawyer?

552
01:07:11,196 --> 01:07:12,497
She's my company advisor.

553
01:07:14,188 --> 01:07:16,344
What will this man do?

554
01:07:21,088 --> 01:07:21,787
Sign this.

555
01:07:28,967 --> 01:07:31,063
Did you buy any new
property again on my name?

556
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,439
No. - Then?

557
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,045
Divorce.- Divorce?

558
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:40,086
You've become big
bore to me, so...

559
01:07:40,111 --> 01:07:41,567
Don't play, Maya.
- Am I playing with you?

560
01:07:49,814 --> 01:07:51,641
Did you believe it?

561
01:07:51,778 --> 01:07:53,962
How easily you get
cheated, Akshay?

562
01:07:56,074 --> 01:07:58,835
You like slaves like me, right?

563
01:07:59,598 --> 01:08:03,101
Not everyone but only you.

564
01:08:04,258 --> 01:08:08,464
This is not divorce papers
but insurance policy.

565
01:08:08,489 --> 01:08:12,534
Till now my sisters were the
nominees for Rs.10 crore insurance.

566
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:19,862
You're my heir to my property
and business after me.

567
01:08:21,796 --> 01:08:24,965
I'll be very happy if
you join me to US trip.

568
01:08:26,026 --> 01:08:27,826
You'll join me, right?

569
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:50,462
Bhoomi, I'm Akshay here.

570
01:08:50,557 --> 01:08:51,687
Whose number this is?

571
01:08:51,712 --> 01:08:53,248
Police confiscated my phone,
I found another phone here.

572
01:08:53,273 --> 01:08:55,726
Where are you now?

573
01:08:55,758 --> 01:08:59,082
I'm just entering flat now.
Entering lift.

574
01:09:04,313 --> 01:09:06,134
Maya's phone went
missing from mortuary.

575
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:09,533
But this phone has
only her call list.

576
01:09:10,008 --> 01:09:12,127
Then, whose phone is it?

577
01:09:12,605 --> 01:09:14,680
Krishna Prasad.- Krishna Prasad?

578
01:09:14,862 --> 01:09:17,313
I told you that Maya introduced him
to me in Move and Pick restaurant.

579
01:09:17,784 --> 01:09:18,984
He is.

580
01:09:19,009 --> 01:09:22,081
Krishna Prasad is lying
as corpse before me.

581
01:09:22,337 --> 01:09:25,517
Till now I had a doubt
that Maya is alive.

582
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:28,892
Now I can surely
say she's alive.

583
01:09:28,917 --> 01:09:33,373
Because she locked me up here
with a mobile phone in body bag.

584
01:09:33,687 --> 01:09:37,035
If we know his details, we
can guess Maya's next move.

585
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,993
What should I do now?

586
01:10:24,778 --> 01:10:32,371
Fly...fly...fly
around the world...

587
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:39,690
Birds will give their
wings to us...

588
01:10:41,979 --> 01:10:48,354
Gift...my life is
your birthday gift...

589
01:10:49,026 --> 01:10:54,582
Happiness is never
ending like sea waves...

590
01:11:07,838 --> 01:11:16,049
Is there any life like this?

591
01:11:16,432 --> 01:11:24,027
With a life partner like her,
life is taller than Himalaya...

592
01:11:25,098 --> 01:11:31,114
Flying high... growing
up step by step..

593
01:11:32,115 --> 01:11:38,011
Win laurels all
over the world...

594
01:11:42,301 --> 01:11:46,301
Could've saved if she was
brought few minutes earlier.

595
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:49,198
Sir, Maya's company's full details
given by her sister Sheetal.

596
01:12:49,223 --> 01:12:51,606
Everything is in this file.

597
01:12:54,365 --> 01:12:57,755
Sheetal is not just an advocate but
company's financial advisor too.

598
01:12:58,563 --> 01:13:00,670
Krishna Prasad's name
is mentioned in it.

599
01:13:00,695 --> 01:13:03,116
Recently Rs. lakhs were
transferred to his account.

600
01:13:03,141 --> 01:13:05,936
But she says she doesn't know
reason for this transaction.

601
01:13:06,489 --> 01:13:11,315
His phone is dead, can I
check personally, sir?

602
01:13:15,871 --> 01:13:18,153
Have you arrested me, sir?

603
01:13:18,178 --> 01:13:20,914
You'll be under my custody
till we find your wife's body.

604
01:13:20,954 --> 01:13:22,728
On what basis you've
taken me into custody?

605
01:13:23,825 --> 01:13:26,970
I think you gave your wife a shot
of BL to induce heart attack.

606
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:30,486
May be you hid the body to avoid
getting detected in autopsy.

607
01:13:30,511 --> 01:13:33,048
Why would I kill my wife?
- You must answer that.

608
01:13:33,073 --> 01:13:34,746
What's the reason
for suspecting me?

609
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:38,387
Your behaviour,a bottle
of BL in your pocket.

610
01:13:38,786 --> 01:13:43,058
That bottle doesn't belong to me.
- But it was manufactured by your company.

611
01:13:43,639 --> 01:13:44,934
Your wife died
with heart attack.

612
01:13:45,941 --> 01:13:47,129
Am I an idiot?

613
01:13:47,177 --> 01:13:50,176
To run around with BL in pocket
after administering it to my wife.

614
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:53,887
BL dissolves in blood in hours.

615
01:13:53,912 --> 01:13:56,856
It can't be found in
post mortem also.

616
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,312
Earlier you said you don't
know anything about it.

617
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:04,304
Now you're speaking
like an expert.

618
01:14:08,999 --> 01:14:11,648
How many times you may ask
about body, I don't know!

619
01:14:12,162 --> 01:14:14,330
You don't know or
you can't tell?

620
01:14:19,275 --> 01:14:20,283
What do you want?

621
01:14:53,509 --> 01:14:55,180
Where did you meet your
wife first time?

622
01:14:57,921 --> 01:14:59,118
Why rake up past, sir?

623
01:14:59,143 --> 01:15:01,639
Because you both
had differences.

624
01:15:02,589 --> 01:15:03,891
Differences?

625
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,032
In age..in status...

626
01:15:05,057 --> 01:15:06,883
In everything.

627
01:15:10,273 --> 01:15:11,372
Come on, tell me.

628
01:15:14,255 --> 01:15:15,536
It was in ,

629
01:15:15,561 --> 01:15:19,737
2004,Bangkok World Medical
conference, I met her there.

630
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:24,020
She played a prank on me
in our first meet.

631
01:15:48,813 --> 01:15:52,760
Who is this poetry in velvet?

632
01:15:55,299 --> 01:16:01,868
The chirping bird in my heart...

633
01:16:02,048 --> 01:16:06,283
A dream that is enticing...

634
01:16:06,658 --> 01:16:12,174
The night sought a kiss...

635
01:16:15,295 --> 01:16:20,231
You hit me like a
cloud of desire...

636
01:16:20,606 --> 01:16:25,172
You celebrated the first
drizzle of kisses...

637
01:16:27,876 --> 01:16:35,121
Flowers are all on fire
through the night...

638
01:16:52,396 --> 01:16:56,738
Is her body made from honey?

639
01:16:57,114 --> 01:16:59,773
Is she my destination?

640
01:16:59,798 --> 01:17:02,334
Weaved with love and passion...

641
01:17:02,556 --> 01:17:08,109
With a passion for search...

642
01:17:08,181 --> 01:17:10,302
What's this desire that is
taking over my heart?

643
01:17:10,327 --> 01:17:13,185
Is it tune of love?

644
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:18,544
You've taken over my heart...

645
01:17:18,569 --> 01:17:24,105
My heart is playing
your music only...

646
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:26,844
Her tresses are blooming flowers...
Her shoulders are home to love...

647
01:17:26,869 --> 01:17:32,548
She's treasure of youth...

648
01:17:37,664 --> 01:17:40,141
Did you love your wife
more or her property?

649
01:17:42,509 --> 01:17:45,081
Do police have right to
ask any question?

650
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:51,651
Tell me, how did you come to
know your wife's death?

651
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:54,605
I've told you everything in
my statement, right sir?

652
01:17:54,629 --> 01:17:58,179
No problem, you can tell me also.

653
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:03,334
When I came back from office,
Maya was sleeping on sofa.

654
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:05,200
I thought she was sleeping.

655
01:18:05,225 --> 01:18:07,773
But got suspicious after seeing her
sleeping with slippers, so I woke her.

656
01:18:07,798 --> 01:18:11,005
She didn't respond. I
called ambulance.

657
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:13,583
Okay, when did you
last see your wife?

658
01:18:14,073 --> 01:18:14,929
I mean when she was alive.

659
01:18:14,954 --> 01:18:16,036
Morning.

660
01:18:16,061 --> 01:18:17,717
She had just returned from US.

661
01:18:18,474 --> 01:18:20,067
When did she go to US?

662
01:18:20,092 --> 01:18:21,748
She went a month ago
for business.

663
01:18:22,045 --> 01:18:23,382
One month!

664
01:18:29,687 --> 01:18:31,796
So, even if wife comes
home after a month,

665
01:18:32,349 --> 01:18:35,324
you say you went to office without
spending time with her.

666
01:18:35,441 --> 01:18:37,398
Am I right?

667
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,629
Why do you suspect me so much?

668
01:18:40,754 --> 01:18:43,191
Maya would be having jet lag, so I went
to office to give her time to rest.

669
01:18:45,594 --> 01:18:47,996
I loved my wife till
her last breath.

670
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:49,373
Loved till is past tense.
Now?

671
01:18:54,812 --> 01:18:56,670
Did your love stop
with her breath?

672
01:18:58,537 --> 01:19:01,264
Doctor says Maya could've got heart
attack because of long flight journey.

673
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:04,386
Why don't you consider it?

674
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:08,738
When my men called, you
weren't there in home.

675
01:19:09,038 --> 01:19:10,972
You said you went out to get
medicine for head ache, right?

676
01:19:11,082 --> 01:19:12,347
Yes.

677
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:14,378
You came straight here from there, right?
- Yes.

678
01:19:15,509 --> 01:19:20,466
Where are the tablets?

679
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:24,498
Why don't you believe
whatever I say?

680
01:19:24,523 --> 01:19:27,177
Not just me, your wife too
didn't believe you.

681
01:19:27,202 --> 01:19:31,200
3  months ago, she engaged a detective
agency to watch over you.

682
01:19:32,112 --> 01:19:34,568
Why should my wife suspect me?
What's the proof?

683
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:37,263
Payment receipt to him is here.

684
01:19:39,113 --> 01:19:41,158
May be she believed you had
an extra marital affair.

685
01:19:41,988 --> 01:19:44,908
,If her suspicion is true
and if she divorces you,

686
01:19:45,087 --> 01:19:46,620
you won't get a penny
from her property,

687
01:19:46,939 --> 01:19:51,252
but the question is, did the detective
knew everything about you?

688
01:19:52,168 --> 01:19:53,225
I think he must have known.

689
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:57,108
So, before detective meets your
wife to tell the truth,

690
01:19:58,069 --> 01:19:59,165
you killed your wife.

691
01:19:59,618 --> 01:20:00,743
Am I right?

692
01:20:07,037 --> 01:20:08,813
My team has gone to
Krishna Prasad's home.

693
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,370
Krishna Prasad...?
- Truth will be out in few minutes.

694
01:20:12,395 --> 01:20:14,620
Krishna Prasad is not a
detective but Maya's lawyer.

695
01:20:14,645 --> 01:20:16,089
He's dead, sir.

696
01:20:21,986 --> 01:20:24,093
Look at this! Krishna Prasad!

697
01:20:29,202 --> 01:20:31,357
Ashok!

698
01:20:37,106 --> 01:20:38,639
What are you doing?

699
01:21:12,204 --> 01:21:14,660
Tell me.

700
01:21:15,308 --> 01:21:17,121
I'm in Krishna Prasad's office.

701
01:21:17,146 --> 01:21:18,722
Visited his home too.

702
01:21:18,747 --> 01:21:22,023
His whereabouts are unknown.

703
01:21:24,107 --> 01:21:26,018
Go to Akshay's home and
check thoroughly.

704
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:36,269
Jhansi, any news about Ganapathy?
- No details yet, sir.

705
01:21:36,527 --> 01:21:37,660
ASI is there.

706
01:22:57,947 --> 01:22:59,055
Tell me, Bhoomi.

707
01:22:59,545 --> 01:23:01,555
I inquired thoroughly.

708
01:23:01,867 --> 01:23:04,321
Krishna Prasad is not a
lawyer but detective.

709
01:23:04,414 --> 01:23:05,888
Any details about him?

710
01:23:05,913 --> 01:23:08,649
No, but I found an envelope near flat
door when I returned from hospital.

711
01:23:08,674 --> 01:23:10,795
I checked it, it contained
a pen drive.

712
01:23:10,842 --> 01:23:14,860
Did the envelop had
Krishna Prasad's name?

713
01:23:14,885 --> 01:23:16,524
No...no...but pen drive had a
folder named Krishna Prasad.

714
01:23:16,549 --> 01:23:19,134
I'll send the folder to you.

715
01:23:23,641 --> 01:23:25,441
I've sent it, check it.

716
01:23:40,422 --> 01:23:41,286
Did you see it?

717
01:23:41,311 --> 01:23:46,231
I don't know who it was but they've
recorded our phone conversations too.

718
01:23:46,928 --> 01:23:48,235
I'll send it, listen to it.

719
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:52,603
Bhoomi, Maya is going to Los
Angeles for a month.

720
01:23:53,311 --> 01:23:55,807
As soon as she returns, I'll
mix BL18  in her wine.

721
01:23:56,003 --> 01:23:58,190
She'll get a heart attack.

722
01:23:58,215 --> 01:24:02,158
I'll prove that she got heart attack due
to stress of long flight journey.

723
01:24:05,982 --> 01:24:08,238
Maya knows everything.

724
01:24:09,956 --> 01:24:11,603
She may have sent us this.

725
01:24:11,628 --> 01:24:14,626
She's come after you now, please
leave the place immediately.

726
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:16,665
How can I go alone...
- Try to understand me, Bhoomi.

727
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:18,687
Your safety is the most
important thing now.

728
01:24:18,744 --> 01:24:20,962
You leave the place now,
I'll join you later.

729
01:24:20,987 --> 01:24:23,704
Won't they leave you
until you confess?

730
01:24:24,126 --> 01:24:26,275
Don't talk illogically.

731
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:29,013
We're not criminals
till Maya is alive.

732
01:24:29,038 --> 01:24:32,053
I'll not discuss about
you with anyone.

733
01:24:32,262 --> 01:24:35,662
No, we shouldn't have met at all.

734
01:24:41,221 --> 01:24:43,316
I'll do anything for you.

735
01:24:44,138 --> 01:24:46,746
I'm too scared, Akshay.

736
01:24:51,153 --> 01:24:53,003
What's that noise?

737
01:24:53,028 --> 01:24:54,462
Lift stopped.

738
01:24:54,936 --> 01:24:56,363
Stopped? Who else is with you?

739
01:24:56,565 --> 01:24:58,839
There's no one with me in lift.

740
01:24:59,388 --> 01:25:00,903
I'm scared.

741
01:25:00,928 --> 01:25:03,559
Bhoomi, press emergency button.

742
01:25:06,426 --> 01:25:08,680
Lift is moving now.

743
01:25:09,364 --> 01:25:12,321
You're fine, right?
- I fear something might happen to me.

744
01:25:12,698 --> 01:25:14,234
I'm not alone here, I feel a
shadow is passing me here.

745
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:17,760
I'm so scared.

746
01:25:21,884 --> 01:25:23,855
Come to airport quickly.

747
01:25:23,971 --> 01:25:26,214
You go, I'll follow you.

748
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:28,575
I'll wait for you in
airport Coffee Day.

749
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:31,273
It's raining heavily.

750
01:26:10,368 --> 01:26:11,119
Where are you going?

751
01:26:11,144 --> 01:26:12,400
I must go.

752
01:26:12,425 --> 01:26:14,939
I'm the officer here, you're
under my custody.

753
01:26:14,964 --> 01:26:16,922
One person is in trouble, needs my
help, please try to understand.

754
01:26:16,947 --> 01:26:18,576
I must go. - Who?

755
01:26:18,746 --> 01:26:21,837
I don't need to answer you.
I must go, that's it.

756
01:26:22,352 --> 01:26:24,046
Just go inside.- Why
should I go inside?

757
01:26:24,071 --> 01:26:25,390
What have I done to
keep me under custody?

758
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:26,374
You go in, I'll tell you.

759
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:28,405
If I think I can...

760
01:26:28,588 --> 01:26:31,121
What man! I'm
trying to tell you!

761
01:26:47,297 --> 01:26:48,288
Call me if there's
any important news.

762
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:56,046
I've sent my team to
the address you gave.

763
01:26:56,929 --> 01:26:58,320
What had happened?

764
01:27:02,636 --> 01:27:03,488
Tell me.

765
01:27:10,586 --> 01:27:13,794
Her name is Bhoomi...Bhoomika.

766
01:27:20,052 --> 01:27:22,513
I went to a college
as guest lecturer.

767
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,193
I met Bhoomika there.

768
01:27:53,327 --> 01:27:55,338
She met me after the class.

769
01:27:55,363 --> 01:27:56,939
Asked me if she missed
anything important.

770
01:27:57,861 --> 01:27:58,778
I lied to her saying yes.

771
01:28:00,616 --> 01:28:02,749
I came to class late today.

772
01:28:16,371 --> 01:28:18,167
She was very weak in chemistry.

773
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:21,612
I started to help her.

774
01:28:21,825 --> 01:28:24,278
Without our knowledge love
blossomed between us.

775
01:28:25,769 --> 01:28:29,122
We started to meet
regularly outside.

776
01:28:31,796 --> 01:28:35,196
I felt my life refreshing
after I met Bhoomi.

777
01:28:52,366 --> 01:28:55,082
I told her everything
that happened in my life.

778
01:28:55,107 --> 01:28:58,540
When she came to know I was
married, Bhoomi was very upset.

779
01:29:03,402 --> 01:29:05,025
After that she never met me.

780
01:29:05,155 --> 01:29:07,189
I almost went mad
without meeting her.

781
01:29:08,355 --> 01:29:11,371
I couldn't live anymore
without Bhoomi.

782
01:29:12,130 --> 01:29:14,659
How many times should I call you?
Why are you avoiding me?

783
01:29:14,684 --> 01:29:17,003
You lied to me.
- I can't live without you.

784
01:29:17,028 --> 01:29:19,183
Decide between me and Maya.
- Look at me.

785
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:22,995
We're going to live together.
You're important to me.

786
01:29:26,146 --> 01:29:28,619
I convinced her that
I'll marry her.

787
01:29:36,508 --> 01:29:39,324
But it wasn't as
easy as I thought.

788
01:29:40,484 --> 01:29:44,515
Maya was watching me.

789
01:29:46,523 --> 01:29:50,750
She used to call times every day to
know where I was and whom I met.

790
01:30:09,658 --> 01:30:12,605
I decided to eliminate Maya
without creating any doubt.

791
01:30:13,124 --> 01:30:15,358
I convinced Bhoomi
to accept this plan.

792
01:30:15,608 --> 01:30:19,569
I planned to murder Maya camouflaging
it as natural heart attack.

793
01:30:21,338 --> 01:30:22,815
But she didn't die.

794
01:30:24,879 --> 01:30:27,874
At least I'm safe
in your custody.

795
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:32,015
Bhoomi is the next
target of Maya.

796
01:30:34,218 --> 01:30:37,286
Save her first, sir.

797
01:30:44,187 --> 01:30:45,456
I can't understand one thing.

798
01:30:46,631 --> 01:30:50,612
You planned and executed
your wife's murder so well.

799
01:30:52,025 --> 01:30:54,882
She's still alive...

800
01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:00,311
Maya is too smart!

801
01:31:00,975 --> 01:31:02,854
After getting
suspicious about me,

802
01:31:02,879 --> 01:31:05,855
she followed to find where I was
going and whom I was meeting.

803
01:31:06,829 --> 01:31:09,741
She came to know about Bhoomika.

804
01:31:11,609 --> 01:31:14,701
She understands very well
even my smallest gestures.

805
01:31:19,068 --> 01:31:23,529
She may have changed the wine
glass I gave her with BL .

806
01:31:27,549 --> 01:31:29,294
It appears logical to hear.

807
01:31:29,424 --> 01:31:32,680
But how can you say your
wife is alive with this?

808
01:31:32,884 --> 01:31:36,280
No...no...sir...Maya is alive.

809
01:31:37,036 --> 01:31:40,241
Maya may have taken Neurolyptic
medicine for catalepsy.

810
01:31:40,546 --> 01:31:42,186
Maya knows everything.

811
01:31:42,211 --> 01:31:44,045
What's neurolyptic medicine?

812
01:31:44,655 --> 01:31:46,005
If it is diluted in blood,

813
01:31:46,398 --> 01:31:48,121
it'll slowdown the
activity of lungs,

814
01:31:48,146 --> 01:31:49,818
heart will stop working.

815
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,657
Once it's agent gets into body,
metabolism will take place,

816
01:31:51,846 --> 01:31:53,115
body will come back
to normal condition.

817
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:55,677
Isn't it risky to do like this?

818
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:59,208
Not for Maya, it's
just a prank to her.

819
01:31:59,841 --> 01:32:01,224
She hates carrying.

820
01:32:02,552 --> 01:32:04,648
Losing I've told you
the complete truth.

821
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:07,238
Please inquire about
Bhoomi's safety, sir.

822
01:32:19,876 --> 01:32:22,598
ACP has called from
Akshay's home.

823
01:32:27,043 --> 01:32:30,035
Found plan of FSL
in Akshay's home.

824
01:32:30,785 --> 01:32:35,214
He has a blue print ready about how
to breach FSL building security.

825
01:32:36,565 --> 01:32:41,167
His Jaguar has items
necessary to dig earth.

826
01:32:41,771 --> 01:32:43,227
It has a shoe also.

827
01:32:43,854 --> 01:32:44,645
Size 10.

828
01:32:45,058 --> 01:32:48,045
One important breakthrough, sir.

829
01:32:49,903 --> 01:32:52,241
Found .38 revolver in his home.

830
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,336
Three bullets are
missing from it.

831
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:56,937
Looks like it was
fired recently.

832
01:32:56,962 --> 01:32:59,179
Any news about Maya's body?
- Not yet found it.

833
01:32:59,536 --> 01:33:01,358
We're searching, sir.

834
01:33:04,922 --> 01:33:06,858
Ganapathy has regained
consciousness, sir.

835
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:08,711
Did he talk to you?
- He did, sir.

836
01:34:57,784 --> 01:34:59,541
Hello control room, my
name is Ganapathy!

837
01:34:59,566 --> 01:35:03,102
Security guard with
Forensic laboratory.

838
01:35:03,185 --> 01:35:04,942
A body here...body is...

839
01:35:04,966 --> 01:35:08,062
Strange things are
happening here, sir.

840
01:35:08,086 --> 01:35:09,619
I'm too scared, sir.

841
01:35:39,242 --> 01:35:42,262
Found these bullets now, it was
fired from . revolver,

842
01:35:42,286 --> 01:35:43,355
the same revolver we
found in your home.

843
01:35:49,279 --> 01:35:52,371
That's not my revolver.
It belongs to Maya.

844
01:35:52,935 --> 01:35:55,056
Your wife is dead.
- You haven't yet proved it.

845
01:35:55,456 --> 01:35:57,197
Body has not yet been found.
You'll never find it.

846
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:00,626
You killed your wife
and stole her body.

847
01:36:01,401 --> 01:36:03,421
Maya's game plan is to make
you think like that.

848
01:36:03,447 --> 01:36:04,900
Can't you understand this?

849
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:06,621
Maya is responsible
for everything.

850
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,501
Krishna Prasad is helping her.

851
01:36:08,526 --> 01:36:11,326
She's playing this
game with his help.

852
01:36:49,066 --> 01:36:50,493
Maya is still alive.

853
01:36:50,692 --> 01:36:52,492
No, you stole her body.

854
01:37:06,189 --> 01:37:08,282
You've this building's
plan in your home.

855
01:37:09,041 --> 01:37:10,817
You confused and scared
security guard.

856
01:37:11,376 --> 01:37:12,974
He met with an accident.

857
01:37:12,999 --> 01:37:16,841
When so many evidences are against
you, am I fool to believe you?

858
01:37:16,866 --> 01:37:20,818
No sir, everything
happening here is drama.

859
01:37:21,425 --> 01:37:24,774
Perfect drama played by Maya
to trap me with confusion.

860
01:37:25,015 --> 01:37:26,329
Trust me, sir.

861
01:37:26,354 --> 01:37:28,509
This accident too
is part of drama.

862
01:37:28,534 --> 01:37:30,801
I've told you everything, sir.

863
01:37:49,901 --> 01:37:52,598
Sir, please save Bhoomika.

864
01:38:15,228 --> 01:38:16,304
Is it?

865
01:38:16,329 --> 01:38:17,640
Inside dam?

866
01:38:17,762 --> 01:38:19,835
I'll be there immediately
along with sir.

867
01:38:20,156 --> 01:38:21,156
Be ready.

868
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:49,993
Fished out the body, sir.

869
01:39:32,521 --> 01:39:33,521
Maya!

870
01:39:54,153 --> 01:39:57,603
No one by the name Bhoomika was
found in the address you gave.

871
01:40:00,011 --> 01:40:03,310
The flat is locked
for many years.

872
01:40:05,609 --> 01:40:06,614
We inquired neighbours.

873
01:40:08,168 --> 01:40:12,149
There's no student by the name
Bhoomika in the college you told us.

874
01:40:18,174 --> 01:40:23,938
Bhoomika is a character you
created to kill your wife.

875
01:40:26,773 --> 01:40:29,173
Everything was your imagination.

876
01:40:47,814 --> 01:40:49,460
Clear the body.

877
01:40:49,485 --> 01:40:50,941
You people...
- Reverse and get the ambulance.

878
01:40:50,966 --> 01:40:52,945
Clear the body.

879
01:40:53,874 --> 01:40:56,292
Careful...take it.

880
01:40:56,317 --> 01:40:59,269
Call Dr.Brinda and inform
about finding Maya's body.

881
01:40:59,553 --> 01:41:01,152
Tell her to arrange for
immediate post mortem.

882
01:41:07,674 --> 01:41:08,755
Deva, tell them to
prepare strong FIR.

883
01:41:10,292 --> 01:41:12,228
He mustn't escape under
any circumstances.

884
01:41:12,339 --> 01:41:14,206
He... - I'll take care.

885
01:41:54,315 --> 01:41:55,168
Come.

886
01:42:10,819 --> 01:42:11,952
You're lying!

887
01:42:26,732 --> 01:42:27,899
You're lying!

888
01:42:27,924 --> 01:42:30,057
You've abducted my Bhoomika.

889
01:42:41,111 --> 01:42:45,676
I'll not let you
harm my Bhoomika.

890
01:42:51,294 --> 01:42:52,777
I'll not let them harm you...

891
01:43:17,259 --> 01:43:18,869
I'll not allow them
to harm you...

892
01:43:19,658 --> 01:43:21,554
You can't walk, right?

893
01:43:23,045 --> 01:43:26,902
Your plight makes me
remember my wife.

894
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:37,558
You don't worry, Shakthi. She'll
walk perfectly in months.

895
01:43:42,044 --> 01:43:44,926
More than our medicine, your
care made her recovery quickly.

896
01:43:45,247 --> 01:43:47,647
I never expected this to happen.

897
01:44:14,019 --> 01:44:15,602
Why are you looking at me?

898
01:44:15,627 --> 01:44:18,243
You'll walk normally
in few more days.

899
01:44:23,016 --> 01:44:26,380
You took care of me all
these years like a child.

900
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:31,360
Hereafter I'll take care
of you like a mother.

901
01:44:59,578 --> 01:45:00,624
My daughter too was in car.

902
01:45:11,506 --> 01:45:12,330
Father!

903
01:45:13,054 --> 01:45:19,293
Don't fear...Sandhya...

904
01:45:22,677 --> 01:45:25,973
Driver of the jeep
that hit us was drunk.

905
01:45:28,317 --> 01:45:30,186
We were fighting for life.

906
01:45:30,211 --> 01:45:33,704
Without any humanity, they
left us to die like animals.

907
01:45:38,442 --> 01:45:40,138
Don't go, uncle...

908
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:42,690
Save us!

909
01:45:47,521 --> 01:45:54,508
Mother!

910
01:46:00,177 --> 01:46:01,671
Father!

911
01:46:05,319 --> 01:46:06,685
Don't get scared, dear.
- Okay, father.

912
01:46:25,745 --> 01:46:28,713
Mother...mother...

913
01:46:31,024 --> 01:46:32,560
What happened to mother?

914
01:46:34,005 --> 01:46:36,821
Mother!

915
01:46:36,846 --> 01:46:43,664
Mother!

916
01:46:44,764 --> 01:46:48,663
My wife died before
ambulance reached us.

917
01:46:54,357 --> 01:46:56,053
I tried to remember
the jeep's number.

918
01:46:57,413 --> 01:46:58,496
I couldn't.

919
01:46:59,906 --> 01:47:03,215
My daughter went into
coma for years in shock.

920
01:47:05,293 --> 01:47:08,215
She told me the jeep's number
after she became normal.

921
01:47:09,405 --> 01:47:12,581
Maya, I think this vehicle
is accident prone.

922
01:47:12,729 --> 01:47:14,720
Last week too we ran over
a man on platform, right?

923
01:47:14,745 --> 01:47:16,902
Is it new to us?
- Uncle, please help us.

924
01:47:17,862 --> 01:47:20,299
I'll just check, Maya.
- Where are you going?

925
01:47:21,715 --> 01:47:23,981
Is this important to us? We've
to attend party, get going.

926
01:47:24,255 --> 01:47:27,115
Uncle, don't go away.
- Child is witness.

927
01:47:27,458 --> 01:47:30,234
If we finish the child too...
- She'll die anyway.

928
01:47:30,259 --> 01:47:31,093
We're getting late.

929
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:32,921
Please save us.

930
01:47:36,294 --> 01:47:39,882
No more kick, I must have
another full bottle.

931
01:47:46,381 --> 01:47:47,464
I'll tell you in detail.

932
01:47:52,317 --> 01:47:54,067
Bhoomika! - She's my daughter.

933
01:47:54,242 --> 01:47:56,373
She's Amrutha not Bhoomika.

934
01:48:02,628 --> 01:48:04,839
If you pick the call, answer it.

935
01:48:11,582 --> 01:48:14,529
It was me who stole your
wife's body from mortuary.

936
01:48:18,282 --> 01:48:21,053
After my daughter gave car
number, I traced you.

937
01:48:21,463 --> 01:48:24,759
I was eager to get you punished for
killing my wife with drunken driving.

938
01:48:25,107 --> 01:48:28,138
But since accident
happened years ago,

939
01:48:29,224 --> 01:48:34,013
it'll be very difficult to prove
now that you were driving drunk.

940
01:48:34,669 --> 01:48:38,351
Moreover you may use your
influence to get out.

941
01:48:39,304 --> 01:48:40,957
Body missing?

942
01:48:40,982 --> 01:48:42,638
You planned and executed
your wife's murder so well.

943
01:48:42,765 --> 01:48:46,284
You said Maya is dead.

944
01:48:48,830 --> 01:48:50,022
My daughter was then.

945
01:48:51,448 --> 01:48:55,065
She asked me one thing, they hit us
by breaking traffic rules, right?

946
01:48:56,065 --> 01:48:57,458
They killed mother, right?

947
01:48:57,680 --> 01:49:01,215
You're a police officer, can't
you punish the criminals?

948
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:05,396
I didn't have an answer
for her question then.

949
01:49:05,421 --> 01:49:09,954
Had you at least called ambulance,
my wife would be alive now.

950
01:49:56,721 --> 01:49:59,264
You escaped from
the accident spot.

951
01:49:59,289 --> 01:50:01,913
My heart was writhing
with revenge.

952
01:50:01,938 --> 01:50:04,866
But we decided to take
revenge after years.

953
01:50:04,891 --> 01:50:09,024
First part of it is to make
Amrutha act like your lover.

954
01:50:48,306 --> 01:50:50,402
You started believing
everything after that.

955
01:50:50,863 --> 01:50:52,043
Including whatever Amrutha said.

956
01:50:53,087 --> 01:50:56,383
She came close to you
to find the truth.

957
01:50:56,821 --> 01:50:59,011
She informed me after
knowing the truth.

958
01:50:59,036 --> 01:51:02,216
Ever since then you were
just a doll in our hands.

959
01:51:04,653 --> 01:51:07,828
Ganapathy ran out in
fear because of me.

960
01:51:15,315 --> 01:51:22,552
I made you believe Krishna Prasad is detective
by sending photos and voice recording.

961
01:51:31,217 --> 01:51:35,152
All my investigations
till now were fake.

962
01:51:36,351 --> 01:51:39,691
Now that body has
also been found.

963
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:43,817
According to law
you're a criminal.

964
01:51:48,059 --> 01:51:51,994
Look there, see for the
last time your wife's body.

965
01:51:52,098 --> 01:51:58,932
Because in few more minutes, they'll
load you too as body in van.

966
01:52:11,767 --> 01:52:14,012
We made you kill your wife.

967
01:52:25,001 --> 01:52:29,429
How you managed to escape without
evidence after killing my wife,

968
01:52:29,979 --> 01:52:34,398
likewise we too made a plan to kill you
both without leaving any evidence.

969
01:52:41,921 --> 01:52:46,054
Its 8 hours now since BL has
dissolved in your blood.

970
01:53:00,270 --> 01:53:02,230
You'll get a heart attack
in few more minutes.

971
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:09,052
As you said reason for heart attack
can't be found in post mortem also.
