Your father's retiring in a month.

16
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,417

You'll know when you'll
have to pay the rent.

30
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,958
No rent! I'll get my own place.

31
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:31,417
We spent a lifetime moving from
one railway-quarters to another.

32

How will you get your own place?

33
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,042

But you haven't fixed that yet.

37

Such a selfish kid!

38
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,542
I told you I'll get it fixed.

43
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:11,750
I am getting late for work.

44
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:14,083
How many times will
I keep altering this gown?

45
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,958
Every time you try it, it's loose.

46
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:17,708
What's the hurry?
There's still time.

47
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:20,958
"Still time!"
Look after the dress, girl.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,750
And that BMC keeps
sending eviction notice.

-Yesterday also they sent one, you know.
-Yeah, yeah.

50
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,417
There's chalk all over the house.

51
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,167
All because of that bloody Mario.

52
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,625
Full day jumping,
pumping, with his wife on the bed.

53
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh Mario!

54
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,042
Give that to me.

55
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:46,125

Mom!

57
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,333
One day they will come crashing
down in the middle of it.

58
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:51,833
Then why don't you leave?

59
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:54,542
Go to Canada. Live with Uncle Willy.

60
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,417
So many times he's asked you to come.

61
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,875
I'll find a place on rent.

62
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,250
I can afford it now.

63
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,167

Yeah, but when?

65
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,208
This building will become my grave.
Only then will you say "I do"?

I don't.

What's your plan B?

173
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,125

And, if you can't give
me a quarterly plan by then...

176
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:11,625
then I have a plan for you.

177
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:17,333
<i>I've no choice but</i>
<i>to tell you, you're fired.</i>

178
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,208
Why does she treat you like a slave?

179
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:26,167
That's not true.
She's a really nice person.

180
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,083
It's just--

181
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,458
-He's getting screwed in the morning.
-Come on.

182
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:32,750
<i>-You're so yummy.</i>
<i>-Don't bite.</i>

183
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:36,042
-Come on.
-Rashi, someone might walk in on us.

184
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,625
Good morning, boss.

185
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,417
Good morning, slave.

186
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:50,708
No, Rashi.
Please.

187
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:55,208
Good morning, baby.
You're still awake?

188
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,750
<i>But out there, it's...</i>

189
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:00,292
<i>Of course, I'll come in your dreams.</i>

190
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,625
<i>Okay, I am in the office. Bye.</i>

191
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:06,500
What happened?

192
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,875
Rashi, what are you doing?

193
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:13,333
Rashi, this isn't a joke.

194
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:15,333
You know, this is very
insulting for me.

195
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,750
Do you know how
insulting this is for me?

196
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:22,292
Why don't you tell Kashin about us?

197
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,458
Tell him what?

198
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,708
That right after he went
to London for three years

199
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:30,167
I started an affair
with an office mechanic.

200
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,125
Rashi.

201
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,542
I am a software engineer.

202
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,458
I've applied for a home loan.

203
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,167
Once we have our own place

204
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,542
you won't have to stay
at Kashin's place anymore.

205
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,167
I saw an article
in the newspaper today.

206
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,208
We just need to get married.

207
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,042
We'll apply for this place together.

208
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,708
We'll pay the installments
from my salary, and then--

209
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,750
Kashin's returning in a couple
of days to surprise me.

210
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,917
I'll tell him everything.

211
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,958
If he's coming to
surprise you then

212
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:04,125
how do you know he's coming?

213
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,667
Sanjay, I synced his email account.
What else?

214
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:14,458
Listen.

215
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:19,042
Shall we go to Jason's wedding
reception together in the evening?

216
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,292
Please.

217
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,125
You know publicly we can't go.

218
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,875
But I can come home
after the reception, right?

219
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,958
I mean, there's no curfew
for me today, right?

220
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:32,000
-Sanjay Chaturvedi!
-Yes, boss.

221
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:36,875
Stop wasting precious office hours.

222
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,208
Get out!

223
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,458
So?

224
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,458
What do you think?

225
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:59,000
Baby, this is for poor people.

226
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,125
-No!
-Yeah!

227
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,083
Who said?

228
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,917
Sam, it's for people like you and me.

229
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,833
No, it's for underprivileged people.

230
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:10,000
You know, people who
can't afford their own place.

231
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,625
They deserve such
government schemes

232
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,542
not you and me.

233
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,792
-I mean, we have our own--
-Your dad's place.

234
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:19,042
Sam, baby...

235
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,708
we should have our own house, right?

236
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,417
Nice nameplate outside. Huh?

237
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,833
D'souza-Masquita residence.

238
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,542
One second.
Why D'souza?

239
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:36,833
After marriage, you'll be Masquita.
You'll move into my house.

240
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,417
You'll be Masquita, I'll be Masquita.

241
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,625
We'll all be Masquitas.

242
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,167
No, Sam! I don't want to.

243
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,042
I want my own little place.
No matter how small it is.

244
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,875
What little place? This?

245
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:52,958
This...

246
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,958
I know about this scheme.
I know about it.

247
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,375
Just today, I gave Ramesh an
advance for the same thing.

248
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,292
Thank you, sir.

249
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,083
Ramesh, keep your hands
on the steering wheel.

250
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:03,083
-Sorry.
-Look ahead.

251
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:05,292
-Sam, just--
-Don't think about this.

252
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,500
You go to the party, enjoy yourself. Okay?

253
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,417
Just have a good time.

254
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,333
-Ramesh.
-Yes, sir.

255
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:10,958
Come back later to pickup madam.

256
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:11,875
-Okay?
-Okay, sir.

257
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,875
Sam, just once listen to--

258
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:15,625
Relax.

259
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,167
No sex yet, right?

260
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,458
She's screwing with you
and you're letting her.

261
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:32,583
Girls need security, man.

262
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:34,125
She's living comfortably
at Kashin's place

263
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,125
and you know
about my situation.

264
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,500
What does sex have to do with a house?

265
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,042
It's got everything
to do with a house.

266
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,667
Most relationships
start at Juhu Beach

267
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,250
and end at Bandstand.

268
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,250
When I have my own place

269
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,958
there will be a flat-screen
TV in the living room.

270
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:49,750
A king-size bed in the bedroom and
then we'll have lots of sex.

271
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:53,958
I love her.
I truly love her!

272
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,458
She's the one, bro.

273
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:01,375
Bro, who's this one?

274
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,125
That's Tina.

275
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:10,958
She is wearing make-up so you aren't
recognizing her.

276
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:15,042
Not her, the one next to her.

277
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:20,625
<i>And now, Ladies and Gentlemen</i>

278
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:24,500

282
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,792
That's when I told him,
it's either my way or the highway.

283
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:40,167
Outstanding! It was really...

284
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,958
<i>Chick-chick-chick-chick!</i>
<i>Chicken Dance!</i>

285
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,250
Rashi ma'am.

286
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:48,333
Could you please fetch
me a glass of Chenin Blanc?

287
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:51,333
<i>I want to see all the lovely</i>
<i>couples on the dance floor.</i>

<i>-Now is a good time to find a partner.</i>
-Thanks.

289
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,542
No one does this better than you.

290
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,083
That's too kind. That's too kind.

291
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:00,292
-Oh, come on.
-But who's he?

292
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,042
<i>I think he's a guy</i>
<i>from the IT Department.</i>

293
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:07,042
<i>The beautiful lady at the end of</i>
<i>the line, she's up for grabs.</i>

294
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:08,833
Give me your other hand.

295
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,833

Sorry?

Chenin.
Chenin Blanc.

350
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,750
-What's this?
-Chenin Blanc.

351
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:42,708
<i>"Open the secrets in your heart, beloved"</i>

352
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:50,208
<i>"Open the secrets in your heart, beloved"</i>

353
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:58,125
<i>"Let me know if you</i>
<i>Can do it or not, beloved"</i>

354
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:05,083
<i>"Open the secrets in your heart, beloved"</i>

355
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:07,417
I want you to feel something.

356
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:12,708
<i>"Can do it or not, beloved"</i>

357
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:18,375
<i>"Open the secrets in your heart"</i>

358
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,417
I've got gas.

359
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:23,625
<i>"Do you want to sleep?"</i>

360
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,000
I see.

361
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,958
-Slave.
-Boss.

362
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,542
Lift me in your arms
and take me to my room.

363
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,750
Of course, boss.

364
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,792
<i>"Or do you want to keep looking at me?"</i>

365
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:40,375
I know what you want.

366
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,750
I want it too.

367
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:48,750
But not here.

368
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,833
Not now.

369
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:55,042
But why?

370
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:57,458
This is Kashin's home.

371
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,000
His bed.

372
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:09,042
It doesn't feel right here.

373
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,917
Sanju! Can't we just cuddle up?

374
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,083
We've been cuddling all this time.

375
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,667
Who is this now?

376
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:49,042
Some or the other relative
is always dropping in.

377
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:52,542
No place to sleep in my own home.

378
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,333
You've been drinking, haven't you?

379
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:00,417
-Who is that?
-Uncle Gajju.

380
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,167
If I catch you drinking again

381
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,833
I'll break your legs.

382
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:05,417
-Where should I sleep now?
-Why?

383
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,625
When you were little

384
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,250
you always wanted
to sleep next to uncle Gajju.

385
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,750
Now go and sleep next to him.

386
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,542
But when he--

387
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,292
Go on.

388
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:29,625
Careful! He has just gone to bed.

389
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,958
Just a few more days.

390
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,958
When I get my own place...

391
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:37,583
you wouldn't have a problem anymore.

392
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,417
Isn't this place your home?

393
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,375
Really?

394
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,417
This place is leased
to us by the Railways.

395
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,375
The rooms are smaller
than a train compartment.

396
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:47,792
Try driving a nail in the wall,
it will come crashing down.

397
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,958
They will kick us
out once father retires.

398
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:52,167
And you call this home.

399
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,125
Home is made up of the
people who live in it.

400
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,917
Not by the size of the
rooms and the walls.

401
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,125
There are way too many people.
That’s the problem.

402
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:02,250
What are you saying?

403
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,833
If that's the case, why don't
you get your own place?

404
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,208
Soon.

405
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:08,125
I've even applied for a loan.

406
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:11,042
It's not easy to get loans. Otherwise,
everyone would've bought their own home.

407
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:15,458
Mom, I work for a bank.
I'll definitely get a loan.

408
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,083
Why won't I get a loan?

409
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,417
Hello! Why won't I get
a 5 million loan?

410
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,958
How would I know?
Ask someone from the department.

411
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:24,667
I'll fix the department.

412
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,667
<i>Unauthorized.</i>

413
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:33,958
<i>Authorized.</i>

414
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:37,292
Wait!

415
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,583
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

416
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,958
-I had applied for a home loan--
-Hi.

417
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:41,875
Hi.

418
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,708
-Hi.
-Hi.

419
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:48,750
-How come you're here?
-Yeah. Karina D'Souza, second floor.

420
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,875
-Oh! Home loan.
-Don't you remember?

421
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,667
Of course. Home loan, second floor.

422
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,167
IT, top floor.

423
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,208
Come.

424
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,542
-Are you upset?
-No.

425
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,667
Oh yeah. I had applied
for a home loan...

426
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,625
but someone rejected it.

427
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:15,333
-Rejected it?
-Yeah.

428
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,458
How is it possible?
Employees get a preference.

429
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,250
Employees get a preference, exactly.

430
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,042
Sanjay Chaturvedi!

431
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,625
Sanjay Chaturvedi.

432
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,667
You know, I was wondering.

433
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,625
I work for this bank...

434
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,542
so I should've got preference.
Getting a loan should've been easy.

435
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,042
But, when it got rejected

436
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,875
I thought there must be a mistake.

437
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:36,417
I thought I'll check it myself.

438
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,167
But these people have no manners.

439
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,792
People in our office
don't understand hierarchy.

440
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,542
I rejected this loan.

441
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:50,792
-Sorry.
-No, don't be.

442
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:53,708
But why?

443
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:57,375
Your salary is 50,000 rupees.

444
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,458
The maximum that you get
in hand must be 45,000--

445
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:00,375
46,000.

446
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,500
-How can you get a loan of 5 million?
-Why not?

447
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:10,417
-I will pay the installments.
-But how?

448
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:14,417
40,000 will be your
monthly installment.

449
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:19,000
-How will you run your house in 6,000?
-I'll do it.

450
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:20,875
You don't have to worry.

451
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:23,042
I won't eat.
I'll live on water and air.

452
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:23,958
I'll do it.

453
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:25,875
Sanjay, don't get upset.

454
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,167
Please check this again.

455
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,458
See, all my IT returns are in order.

456
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:32,417
Here's my insurance policy form.

457
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,875
And, these are all my bank statements.

458
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,208
Please check it once.

459
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:38,625
I've checked everything,
Sanjay, it's just...

460
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,917
It's policy, I can't really,
I can't...

461
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:42,417
I can't help you.

462
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:57,500
I had job offers
from the best IT firms.

463
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:02,917
But I opted to fix servers
in the technical department instead.

464
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:05,583
Do you know why?

465
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:08,042
I thought that if I work in this bank

466
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:10,708
it'll be easier for
me to get a home-loan.

467
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:12,583
I'll get a preference, like you said.

468
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:14,667
So what is this?

469
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:19,625
Sanjay, why are you
getting upset with me?

470
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,958
-I'm just doing my job.
-No, you're not doing your job.

471
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:28,583
You think, these bunch of
stamps have given you

472
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:32,292
the power to decide who's going
to stay in the city.

473
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,625
No problem. You're doing your job.

474
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:35,917
Let me tell you one thing.

475
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,833
These rubber stamps,
or some bank stooge

476
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:39,667
won't decide whether
I should live here or not.

477
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,583
Hey!

478
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:43,125
I am not a stooge, okay.
Watch your tongue.

479
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,000
He's crazy.

480
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,250
Listen, you take this rickshaw,
I'll take another one.

481
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,000
No, it's okay.

482
00:27:58,458 --> 00:27:59,792
I'm really sorry.

483
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,792
I was upset because I didn't get
the loan and I blurted nonsense.

484
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,208
And, now this...

485
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:09,917
I am sorry.

486
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:12,083
Can I take you out for coffee?

487
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,417
I know it's a little...

488
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,583
It's near by.

489
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:18,875
Just a little far...

490
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:22,917
Please, don't be angry.

491
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:26,708
You called me a stooge.

492
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,875
Yeah.

493
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,250
I meant, employee.

494
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:36,208
Sanjay, employee.
Karina...

495
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,000
Employee.

496
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,333
You see...

497
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:47,125
I've lived in every railway quarter
from Dahisar to Mumbai Central.

498
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:50,417
But now, I want a permanent
address in this city.

499
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,417
Nothing else.

500
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:53,250
What?

501
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:57,125
Have you seen this ad?

502
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,958
-Jeevan Saathi--
-Housing Scheme!

503
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,250
Of course, I have.

504
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,083
That’s why I applied for the loan.

505
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:08,417
I was going to take the
lottery form too, but...

506
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,708
-It's pointless now.
-Why? It's still possible.

507
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:15,000
Why are you doing it alone?

508
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,208
Why don't you apply
for a joint loan with your...

509
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,417
-Are you married?
-No.

510
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:23,292
Any girlfriend?

511
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:24,542
Sir.

512
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:26,958
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

513
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,375
Maybe.

514
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:31,958
Why?

515
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:35,333
Then make up your mind
and apply for it together.

516
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:37,167
Pay the EMIs together.

517
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:38,792
Is that possible?

518
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,625
Nowadays, all husbands and
wives run their home together.

519
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:42,542
You know.

520
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:44,917
They share all the responsibilities 50-50.

521
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,917
Go to work, come home,
and do the dishes together.

522
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,417
Put the clothes out to dry together.

523
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:53,500
Chill together on Sundays.
Order a takeout.

524
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,125
Why? Why takeout?

525
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,917
Cooking together is also romantic.

526
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,250
But who's going to cook every day?

527
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,250
Not every day. Alternate days.

528
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:05,042
You can cook on some days,
and on the other days, I--

529
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:09,417
I mean, your girlfriend.

530
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:13,375
What did you say her name was?

531
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,042
I didn't tell you her name yet.

532
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:20,167
Sorry, this scheme
is only for married couples.

533
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:22,917
-So, I...
-Doesn't matter.

534
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,083
I can even get married for the house.

535
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,792
-What?
-What?

536
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:30,167
I'm just joking.

537
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,917
<i>Are you and Samuel applying too?</i>

538
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:34,458
No, he lives with his parents.

539
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:36,625
He has three servants at home.

540
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,208
You're so lucky.

541
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:41,083
No home loan, no cooking
or doing the dishes.

542
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,583
But, that's my dream.

543
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:47,458
It's your dream to make
your husband do the dishes?

544
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,125
No.

545
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:52,083
My own little place.

546
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:54,333
Sharing all the
responsibilities equally

547
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:56,083
-but here--
-It's one-sided.

548
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:12,542
This is me.

549
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,708
42 rupees.

550
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,375
Sorry?

551
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,958
The rickshaw fare, 50-50.
How can you forget your dream?

552
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh, sorry. Yes.

553
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,917
I am joking.

554
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:25,292
See you tomorrow.

555
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:26,917
-Bye.
-Bye.

556
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:27,875
Karina...

557
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:32,708
I've been practicing
every day in the bathroom.

558
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,667
What?

559
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,792
Whenever we dance,
your phone starts to ring.

560
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,417
Yeah, I...

561
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:16,833
My status will get updated today.
So...

562
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:18,875
-Oh!
-Yeah.

563
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:21,083
All the best.

564
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:22,583
I'll see you.
Bye, thanks.

565
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:23,625
Bye.

566
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,333
Rashi, we'll have our own place.

567
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,458
Our names will be on the nameplate.

568
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:34,958
And we'll share everything 50-50.

569
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:38,125
We'll have sex twice on Sundays,
lots of food and deep conversations.

570
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,333
This is it! This is it!

571
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,417
Rashi, you have to decide now.

572
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,625
You have to decide now.

573
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:44,000
It's Kashin or me.

574
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:44,958
Kashin or me!

575
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,167
Kashin or me!

576
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:49,208
-Hi, Kashin.
-Hey, Sanjay!

577
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:51,500
So good to finally meet you, man.

578
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:53,625
Rashi's been waiting for you.

579
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:57,583
Aww. You got me my favorite flowers.

580
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:01,167
See. You don't even know
what my favorite flowers are.

581
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,042
Sanjay, make tea for everyone.

582
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:07,708
Hey! He's not your employee here.

583
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:09,375
He's my friend.

584
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:10,375
Go.

585
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:12,083
Go and get wine for everyone.

586
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,333
This is his house, too.

587
00:33:14,417 --> 00:33:16,250
There's no need for this formality.

588
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,875
Sorry.

589
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,875
An irritating habit since childhood.

590
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:29,667
You know, Sanjay, I am really happy

591
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,958
-that Rashi found you.
-Yeah, right...

592
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:37,500
No. What do you mean?

593
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,708
I was really insecure.

594
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:42,667
Who is this guy?
Why is he getting so close?

595
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,000
She explained to me that you're
like her best friend.

596
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:47,792
Like a brother.

597
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,458
But I still didn't believe her.

598
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,833
I wanted to punch you in the face.

599
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,500
-But then she sent me your picture.
-I see.

600
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,250
And I finally got it.

601
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:10,583
What? What did you understand?

602
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,708
Baby!

603
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,083
<i>Bless us, O Lord</i>

604
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:25,208
and these thy gifts
which we are about to receive--

605
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:29,833
<i>from thy bounty,</i>
<i>through Christ our Lord. Amen.</i>

606
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:31,000
Aww.

607
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:35,083
-All okay, dear?
-Yeah, all good.

608
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:40,083
I have an announcement to make.

609
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:44,000
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

610
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,500
I got a call.

611
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:51,167
-From where, son?
-From up.

612
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:56,000
From within! From within!

613
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:58,292
<i>See, I can't live like you guys.</i>

614
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:00,292
<i>First earn money, then more money.</i>

615
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,792
Buy property, spend your
life fighting for that property.

616
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:04,500
Then you die fighting
for that property.

617
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:05,500
I can't live like this.

618
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,208
There are millions
of people in our country

619
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:09,667
-who need our help.
-Is he becoming a priest?

620
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,375
You're going to become a priest?

621
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,458
I am not becoming a priest, I...

622
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,667
-I formed an NGO. We're going to be
-NGO?

623
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,417
-traveling across the country.
-What's an NGO?

624
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:21,417
Imphal, Kohima, Guwahati, and
then that other state, down south...

625
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,708
I think it's Orissa.

626
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:23,750
Orissa!

627
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:26,708
I told everyone that they are getting
married after Easter this year.

628
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,625
I thought you were going
to propose to her today.

629
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:30,000
-That was the idea.
-Mom!

630
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:32,417
I wanted to do all that only, Aunty.
Will you marry me?

631
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,875
Not aunty.
But Karina, will you marry me?

632
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,333
<i>You know, after three months.</i>

633
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:37,458
<i>Three months?</i>

634
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:40,875
See, because, I know. But that
will give her time to wind up her job.

635
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:42,833
And then she doesn't
have to rot in that bank

636
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:44,167
and work for those leeches anymore.

637
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,000
-Bloodsuckers.
-Banks are the worst.

638
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:46,917
I hate banks.

639
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Look, son. That house
is falling down on our heads.

640
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,042
-You know that.
-I know.

641
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,750
If you want to change
the world, you go.

642
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:56,958
Who is stopping you?

643
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,125
-But go after the wedding.
-Aunty...

644
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:01,750
we will get married,
as soon I am back.

645
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:02,833
You have my word.

646
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:03,875
-Mom!
<i>-You don't worry.</i>

647
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,208
<i>-I'll speak to Father Lori.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

648
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:07,750
<i>-We'll all speak to Father Lori.</i>
<i>-I have to leave.</i>

649
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,958
Karina!

650
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:15,042
-She's nervous or what?
-No, just shy.

651
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:17,333
Karina!

652
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,458
Not nice to walk out in
the middle of dinner, like this.

653
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:20,417
What will they say?

654
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,583
Karina, girl,
why are you walking so fast?

655
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,750
What do you think?
I am a dog, or what?

656
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,458
Handing my leash over to someone else.

657
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:28,542
How does he get to decide when
I get married, where I should work

658
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:29,792
how I should lead my life?

659
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,042
What if he leaves me, then?

660
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:33,958
What are you going to do?

661
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,000
-What are you going to do?
-Enough, come home.

662
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,042
I don't want to become you.

663
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,375
Living in your brother's house.

664
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:44,042
This charity.
Bloody helpless, homeless.

665
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:46,375
Yeah!
Big you've become.

666
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:49,333
Standing on the road
and being arrogant!

667
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,542
You know what days I removed?

668
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,667
I slogged day and night so
that you could go to school and all.

669
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,333
And now you turn around and
say you don't want to be me?

670
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,208
You will never be me.

671
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:04,083
I could've had a different life.
I could've got married again.

672
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:05,875
But I chose you!

673
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:10,250
I want to see you walking
down the aisle in that lovely dress

674
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,375
settling with one decent chap.

675
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,458
Is that too much for a mother to ask?

676
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:17,500
Don't want to be me!

677
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,000
You'll never be me!

678
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:33,250
-Are you approving Sanjay's loan?
-What are you doing?

679
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,292
It's someone else's.

680
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:39,708
You disapproved his loan,
but I guess you've approved the guy.

681
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:44,792
I saw you two leave together.

682
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,500
Tina, mind your own business.

683
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:51,083
You're sounding upset.
As if Sam proposed to you.

684
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:56,958
Did he? Really?

685
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:59,167
Leave.

686
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,250
Fine, don't tell me.

687
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,167
Actually, now I've understood
your concept of 50-50.

688
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:13,000
Romance with Sanjay,
and marriage with Sam.

689
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,958
Great!

690
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:27,833
Tomorrow is the last date.

691
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:30,292
What for?

692
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,583
Jeevan Saathi Housing Scheme.

693
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:42,458
But you two broke-up, right?

694
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,583
Samuel's going to Imphal, right?

695
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:53,292
Then he's going to Sikkim, then Kohima.

696
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,292
Those guys must be really lucky

697
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,875
who will get their own house.

698
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,417
Actually, the lucky ones are those

699
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,417
who are seeing this dream together,
you know.

700
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:05,000
The dream of their own home.

701
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:07,625
Wouldn't it be great if we...

702
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:10,750
I mean, wouldn't
that be really simple?

703
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:26,000
Can't we apply for a joint loan?

704
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:28,667
I mean, let's fill the form together.

705
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:31,125
If we win the lottery,
what more can we ask for?

706
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:35,042
-Sanjay, it's for married couples.
-Yeah, I know.

707
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,750
All I am saying is,
let's fill the form.

708
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:37,917
And submit it.

709
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
One minute.
Are you proposing marriage to me...

710
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:44,750
-in a rickshaw?
-Yeah!

711
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:47,667
No, I am not proposing to you.

712
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:50,458
All I am saying is,
let's fill the form.

713
00:39:50,542 --> 00:39:51,458
And, if we get it

714
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:53,833
-we'll decide what to do with it.
-Do what?

715
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,625
What?

716
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,167
We'll workout a deal, Karina.

717
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,833
Like how, what, how much...

718
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:03,250
All I am trying to say is that this
is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

719
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,875
We won't get this scheme,
this location, this home again.

720
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:07,167
Sanjay...

721
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:11,542
What are you saying?
What are you saying?

722
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:16,458
-All this, for a house?
-No.

723
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,125
-Sorry.
-No.

724
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,417
No? Yeah.

725
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:24,583
It's a 550 sq.ft. home, so...

726
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:27,708
Sorry.

727
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,167
550 built up?

728
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,083
Carpet area.

729
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,542
And two separate washrooms.

730
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:49,083
Balcony.

731
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:51,292
Modular kitchen.

732
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:55,042
With clips in the passage
for drying clothes.

733
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:16,958
Karina...

734
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:25,875
Lift?

735
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:28,917
-Two.
-Parking?

736
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Stilt.

737
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:32,167
With a jungle gym for kids.

738
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,625
Karina, I am just saying
let's apply for it.

739
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:39,417
We won't get it so easily.

740
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:42,125
And, if you have your own home

741
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,917
you'll be able to live your
life on your own terms.

742
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:50,958
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

743
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:55,500
Hey...

744
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:06,708
I have a surprise for you.

745
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:16,375
Surprise!

746
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:20,042
What's this?

747
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:22,542
What? This is your little place.

748
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:24,750
I've been working on this for a while.

749
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:27,708
Look, I got the sewing
machine, and the...

750
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:29,000
Look.

751
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:30,792
Desk.

752
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:33,292
You know, you can work here.
Aunty Blossom can work there.

753
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:35,750
Listen, I am really
sorry about yesterday.

754
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:38,917
I made that announcement,
and I threw everyone off.

755
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,167
I know you want to get married soon

756
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,292
because your house is falling
on your head, but now you have this.

757
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:46,000
You know, you're very own space.

758
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:48,917
You and Aunty Blossom
can move in immediately.

759
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
You have complete privacy.

760
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:51,292
Your own entrance.

761
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:52,833
And, once we get married

762
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:55,458
Aunty Blossom can move to Canada.

763
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:57,208
And we can...

764
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:00,125
These windows don't open?

765
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:01,917
They are jammed.

766
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:04,375
But, you don't need to.

767
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,667
There's AC. So...

768
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:10,167
You don't need to open the windows.

769
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:11,542
And...

770
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,208
Ta-dah!

771
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:20,125
Our nameplate 'Kar-Sam'.

772
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:22,750
It's our names, Karina and Samuel.

773
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,458
-I can see that.
-I put your name first.

774
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:26,042
Yeah, I can see that too.

775
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:26,958
Babe...

776
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,792
I'll always look after you.

777
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,208
You don't have to worry about
a thing till I am there.

778
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:38,875
And when you're not there?

779
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:40,792
When I am not there...

780
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:00,125
-Yes?
-Where were you, Raju?

781
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:03,208
I told you to come immediately
when you hear the bell.

782
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:05,833
You just ruined it all.
Go!

783
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:07,500
-Go away.
-Sorry, sir.

784
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:13,042
Anyway, so when I am not there,
he's there.

785
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:15,625
-Great!
-Isn't it?

786
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:18,542
Yes! Great!

787
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:33,542
<i>She went for a meeting.</i>
<i>You don't remember that.</i>

788
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:34,917
<i>She doesn't have a boyfriend.</i>

789
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
<i>No boyfriends.</i>

790
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:37,875
We still have three hours left.

791
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:51,583
Jeevan Saathi office?

792
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:08,375
Sign here, on your photograph.

793
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:10,958
Half here and half on the photograph.

794
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:22,000
-Doesn't this feel strange?
-Why?

795
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:26,458
I mean, are we doing the right thing?

796
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:27,833
The right thing?

797
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,750
What we're doing is mind-blowing.

798
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:33,792
We...
Hold on. I got it, bro.

799
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:35,708
<i>Check if everyone has the PAN card.</i>

800
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:38,167
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

801
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,250
-No problem.
<i>-It's a very essential scheme.</i>

802
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:43,542
<i>The following documents are mandatory.</i>
<i>Marriage certificate.</i>

803
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:46,000
-400,000 demand draft.
<i>-PAN card...</i>

804
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:47,708
Marriage Certificate.

805
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:51,333
But we don't have
a marriage certificate.

806
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,333
-Neither do we have the money.
-Yeah, that...

807
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:56,125
<i>Yes, you can keep</i>
<i>the snacks here.</i>

808
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:59,125
Take this receipt and go.

809
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:07,000
-There is one way.
-What?

810
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:11,583
Sanjay, now I realized

811
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:15,958
why that pick-pocketer's
story melted your heart.

812
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:18,167
Everyone in Mumbai has
a problem with space.

813
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:22,792
-Correct.
-But, only a few have a heart like you.

814
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,875
I will do your job. Give me the file.

815
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,208
Here's the form.

816
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,292
Along with all the papers in the file.

817
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:31,292
And, in whose name
will be the ownership?

818
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:33,417
-Single or Joint?
-Joint.

819
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,500
We'll share it 50-50.

820
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,833
Love marriage?

821
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:41,208
Planning to elope, aren't you?

822
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:44,333
Nice, but don't tell anyone.

823
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:48,792
-Give me the cheque.
-Well, the cheque--

824
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:50,542
-It is necessary for the deposit.
-Correct.

825
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,250
If you don't get the house,
the money will be refunded.

826
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:54,917
-Yeah, but now--
-Mr. Rehmat, I'll get it in a week's time.

827
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,958
This is official work.

828
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:04,417
-What about the marriage certificate?
-It's not there.

829
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:08,917
Actually, we just got married.
So...

830
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:11,375
The marriage certificate
hasn't arrived yet.

831
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:12,500
Exactly.

832
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,000
Sanjay...

833
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:17,667
I've been working
here for 15 years now.

834
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,333
<i>I can judge from the face</i>

835
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:21,833
<i>whether a person's married,</i>
<i>or if he's divorced</i>

836
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:23,708
<i>or if he's in a</i>
<i>live-in relationship.</i>

837
00:47:23,792 --> 00:47:25,250
Not to worry.

838
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:27,292
When God creates a problem

839
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:30,000
we always find a solution.

840
00:47:30,292 --> 00:47:33,208
Just do as I say.

841
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:37,875
<i>It's all perfect, son.</i>

842
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:38,833
<i>The entire process is computerized.</i>

843
00:47:38,917 --> 00:47:39,875
<i>It'll close down at 6:00 p.m.</i>

844
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,333
Their love-story will end right here.

845
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:42,458
Run! Run!

846
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:46,333
Now, have a sweet.

847
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:49,542
We just submitted the application.

848
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:51,000
-Once we get the house, we'll--
-No, no.

849
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:53,083
You two can have a home together

850
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:55,000
only when you two get together.

851
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:57,083
What?

852
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,375
Look, he has taken the form to

853
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,167
get a date for the
marriage registration.

854
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:04,542
Next, he's taking the
file to the housing department.

855
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:06,958
And once you get a
marriage registration date

856
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:10,292
in the next couple of weeks,
you must get married.

857
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:13,500
If you get lucky, your form
will move from here to there.

858
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:16,667
And then, happily ever after.

859
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:19,125
Go. Go.

860
00:48:19,542 --> 00:48:22,792
Mr. Kamlesh, the file is ready.

861
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:32,917
Don't worry, it won't come to that.

862
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:38,875
If we get the house,
we'll complete all the formalities.

863
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,542
And the divorce registration is right
next to the marriage registration.

864
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:59,250
Listen, don't worry.

865
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:03,417
Tomorrow, after work,
we'll work out a deal.

866
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,958
In case we get the home.

867
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:07,167
And, if we don't

868
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,208
at least we'll know that we tried.

869
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,042
Karina.

870
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:15,375
Thank you.

871
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:17,417
And congratulations!

872
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,250
Listen...

873
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:27,250
You'll have to manage the deposit money.

874
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,250
My mother handles my finances, so--

875
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,875
You don't worry, I'll talk to the HRD.

876
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:33,375
Rashi ma'am loves me.

877
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:37,167
Bye.

878
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:40,833
Don't act smart!

879
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:43,083
If Kashin had found out about us

880
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:45,292
you would've been dead.

881
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:47,500
Honor killing is very
common in our community.

882
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:48,875
Rashi, please. I...

883
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:50,792
I don't want to talk about that.

884
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:54,167
I wanted to discuss
something personal.

885
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:57,208
-I--
-You love someone else.

886
00:49:57,375 --> 00:50:00,125
-No. No, I--
-You're going to marry her.

887
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:02,125
Yeah. No, it's just--

888
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,292
You're here to invite me to the wedding.

889
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,208
Rashi!

890
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:10,542
I want to borrow 400,000
from my personal provident fund.

891
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,167
Because I'm buying my own home.

892
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,125
I just need your signature.

893
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:16,958
You're getting a home with her.

894
00:50:17,042 --> 00:50:18,792
You couldn't wait for me, Sanjay.

895
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,750
Rashi, I waited for you
for three years.

896
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,625
-You and Kashin--
-Listen, Kashin and me--

897
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:25,833
I don't want to interfere
between you two, Rashi.

898
00:50:26,417 --> 00:50:31,000
I really, really need this house.

899
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,792
I also really need you, Sanjay.

900
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:38,792
My slave.

901
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:42,708
<i>Fine.</i>

902
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:44,667
<i>And let's say that if we do get the house</i>

903
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,875
-you can apply for a home loan.
-Yeah.

904
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,417
And according to the
current market rate

905
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,833
I mean, if you can afford it

906
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:52,792
you can pay me my share, right?

907
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:54,625
Or, if I want
to keep the house

908
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:56,792
I'll pay you your share,
or something like that.

909
00:50:56,875 --> 00:50:58,250
-We'll work it out.
-Yeah.

910
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:00,833
And, if we both can't afford it

911
00:51:00,917 --> 00:51:03,500
or if we can't find a partner, we'll
sell it at the market rate.

912
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:04,958
-At least we'll get half the price.
-Half price, correct.

913
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:05,875
Correct.

914
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,417
And, we can even rent
out the place whenever we want.

915
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:09,958
Because we won't find a
property like this again, Karina.

916
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:11,792
-True.
-This...

917
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:13,667
Sorry, I guess that's your drink.

918
00:51:13,792 --> 00:51:15,750
No, it's not mine either.

919
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:18,375
-It's complimentary, ma'am.
-Why?

920
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:23,208
-Happy Valentine's Day.
-Aww. So sweet!

921
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,333
Thank you.

922
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:27,292
-No, we aren't...
-No.

923
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:30,708
-We're not...
-Sir, complimentary means, its free.

924
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:33,917
Idiot, I know that
complimentary means free.

925
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:35,583
Leave.

926
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:54,917
-Shall we get a cab instead?
-No, no.

927
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,750
I love traveling by train.

928
00:51:56,875 --> 00:52:00,458
When I'm with Samuel,
we always take the car

929
00:52:00,542 --> 00:52:02,583
so I've lost touch, that's it.

930
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:03,583
Well, you can go to the

931
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:06,958
-ladies compartment at the next station.
-No.

932
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:08,792
I'll be with you.

933
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:18,542
Sanju! How are you?

934
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,542
Uncle Mishra, I'm absolutely fine.

935
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:23,042
Come here.

936
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:24,042
Come on.

937
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:25,750
Madam, make some space. He's staff.

938
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,708
It's alright,
I'll be getting down soon.

939
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:29,208
Everyone's got to get down somewhere.

940
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:30,958
I am not taking this train home.

941
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,042
Where are you working these days?

942
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,667
Same place, Centrum IT Department.

943
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,792
Private. Good. Very good.

944
00:52:41,917 --> 00:52:46,625
-What's your salary?
-The pay's decent, okay.

945
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:50,792
You should get a bike now.
It'll be more comfortable.

946
00:52:53,542 --> 00:52:56,292
<i>Hey! Come on, move ahead!</i>

947
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:08,125
It's alright.
He's staff.

948
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,000
-I'm going to the head office tomorrow.
-I see.

949
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:13,292
I'll meet up with your father.

950
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:15,333
I'll tell him that we met.

951
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,417
Good.

952
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:31,542
Some people just don't
care where they are.

953
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:43,667
Yeah, at the cafe, the park

954
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,458
in the rickshaw or the train.

955
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:50,833
It's really awkward in the train.

956
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,792
But they really don't have a choice.

957
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:55,458
There's lack of space in the city.

958
00:53:55,542 --> 00:53:58,125
For you know, kissing.

959
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:01,792
Kissing?

960
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:06,042
Because, as the tradition
of the Raghu clan goes

961
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08,375
<i>'Give your life, but</i>
<i>never give up a kiss.'</i>

962
00:54:27,708 --> 00:54:29,208
-Karina!
-No!

963
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:31,083
It's okay.

964
00:54:31,792 --> 00:54:33,542
It happens.

965
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:38,333
Look, this is not part of the deal.

966
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:46,000
-But I had a good time.
-Yeah, me too.

967
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,042
And you're cute.

968
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,125
Happy Valentine's Day, bye.

969
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:14,583
Do you remember Mr. Dubey?

970
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:16,750
He owns a soap factory.

971
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:19,083
-And stone quarrys too.
-Yeah.

972
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:23,125
He's got a daughter, Tripti.
She's studied at Kota.

973
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,875
She is so beautiful.

974
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:30,417
I sent him your picture on WhatsApp.

975
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:31,750
The girl likes you.

976
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:34,958
Take a look at her DP picture

977
00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:37,250
and tell me what you think,
so that we can talk further.

978
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:40,750
This is crazy, Mom.
I don't want to see anyone's photo.

979
00:55:41,917 --> 00:55:43,792
Don't try to retire me too.

980
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,333
Have a look, you'll change your mind.

981
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:48,000
She's really good looking.

982
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:50,250
<i>Why don't you sit and talk?</i>

983
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:51,833
I'm washing my hands.

984
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:53,875
<i>You don't need to wash</i>
<i>your hands to see the photo.</i>

985
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:54,833
<i>Take a look.</i>

986
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:58,500
<i>Come and eat, so that</i>
<i>I can finish my work.</i>

987
00:55:58,667 --> 00:56:00,083
<i>Coming.</i>

988
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:03,750
<i>I won't leave until</i>
<i>you haven't eaten.</i>

989
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:07,042
You start snoring then.

990
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:08,333
While I am waiting here.

991
00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:11,458
<i>Even the other day, when</i>
<i>I was fixing the key...</i>

992
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:15,500
-Hi.
-Hi.

993
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:17,917
<i>-Sanju.</i>
-Coming.

994
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,833
I really need to talk to you.

995
00:56:24,208 --> 00:56:27,583
Can we sneak into your room?

996
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:30,667
My room? I don't have a room.

997
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:35,708
-I sleep right here in the hall.
-Oh! Cute.

998
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:37,250
<i>Sanju!</i>

999
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,000
Are you washing your hands or bathing?

1000
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:40,708
Coming, Mom.

1001
00:56:40,792 --> 00:56:43,500
<i>Until I don't fix that one key</i>
<i>I'm going to eat salty things.</i>

1002
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:48,000
You know, Sam and I...

1003
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:53,792
We... We hadn't done it.

1004
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:58,708
Till now.

1005
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:06,167
But, before he left
for Imphal today...

1006
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:11,583
He... he wanted to make out, and--

1007
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:18,625
But... I said no.

1008
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:26,833
-Because, I cheated, and--
-No, Karina. You didn't cheat.

1009
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:30,250
It just happened.

1010
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:34,958
Look you were right.
This was not the part of our deal, and...

1011
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:39,917
-I don't have any right to, you know...
-No.

1012
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,500
I said no to Samuel because
I thought I'd be cheating on you.

1013
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:48,792
I should go.

1014
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,083
-Karina.
-I don't know if this is right, or--

1015
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:52,208
It's great.

1016
00:57:52,458 --> 00:57:54,000
It's great, because...

1017
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,792
my relationship status
is now single, so...

1018
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:04,417
Even my status is single.

1019
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:08,042
Did you break-up with Samuel?

1020
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,833
Yes.

1021
00:58:13,917 --> 00:58:17,875
But why did you take such
a long pause before saying 'yes'?

1022
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,625
I mean, I've written
everything in the letter.

1023
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,417
No, Karina.
I'll jump down from here.

1024
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,833
I am done playing
this unsure game in life.

1025
00:58:26,917 --> 00:58:28,375
I want to be sure now, please.

1026
00:58:28,458 --> 00:58:30,917
Sanjay, I'm standing
at your terrace

1027
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,167
at this hour.
What else do you want?

1028
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,000
I don't have feelings for him,
I've feelings for...

1029
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,917
Can... Can you feel it?

1030
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,375
Of course, I do.

1031
00:58:44,917 --> 00:58:47,375
It's the oldest and the most
common feeling in the world.

1032
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:51,500
But it feels new every time.

01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:46,375
I don't know. Are you sure about--

1048
01:00:46,458 --> 01:00:47,625
<i>I found it! I found it!</i>

1049
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:50,375
Is that Sanjay?

1050
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:52,500
-What's happening?
-I don't know what's happening.

1051
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:54,375
We won't find a more perfect place.

1052
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:55,292
-Sanjay...
-Sanjay?

1053
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:56,333
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

1054
01:00:56,417 --> 01:00:58,083
I can't clock out before 6.
What are you doing?

1055
01:00:58,167 --> 01:00:59,458
I'm the IT guy,
I'll clock out for you.

1056
01:00:59,542 --> 01:01:00,875
-Bye, Tina.
-Bye.

1057
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:02,792
Bye!

1058
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,167
-Sanjay, where are we going?
-Hurry up!

1059
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:10,417
-You've kept me waiting for so long.
-Sorry! Sorry!

1060
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,042
-Start it up.
-Sure.

1061
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:14,208
Come on.

1062
01:01:14,292 --> 01:01:16,083
Are you mad?

1063
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:17,500
I'm not going anywhere in this.

1064
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:18,875
I am going home.

1065
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:22,583
That's where I'm taking you.

1066
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:38,000
Welcome to D'Souza
and Chaturvedi Residence.

1067
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:43,417
This building is under the
Jeevan Saathi scheme we had applied for.

1068
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:48,000
And this, this will be our home.

1069
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,458
Top floor.

1070
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:56,083
But we can also get the
first floor in the lucky draw.

1071
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:58,042
We won't necessarily get this place.

1072
01:01:58,125 --> 01:02:00,042
Let's dream big, middle-class.

1073
01:02:17,042 --> 01:02:22,333
<i>"Whenever the rains will come uninvited"</i>

1074
01:02:22,542 --> 01:02:27,833

1075
01:02:27,917 --> 01:02:33,417
<i>"And get drenched in the mild fragrance"</i>

1076
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:38,792

01:02:51,042 --> 01:02:53,833

01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:56,458

01:02:56,667 --> 01:02:59,417
<i>"Sanctuary</i>

1082
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,958

<i>"Sanctuary</i>

1084
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:07,500
<i>"A sanctuary like home"</i>

1085
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:17,958
This is amazing.

1086
01:03:21,917 --> 01:03:23,208
It is.

1087
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:31,500
This whole thing. This house.

1088
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,000
Its perfect.

1089
01:03:37,667 --> 01:03:40,792
Not the house. This...

1090
01:03:42,292 --> 01:03:44,667
This is amazing. Us!

1091
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:51,833
Are you sure?

1092
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:59,958
Yes, I am sure.

1093
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,792
This wasn't part of the deal.

1094
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:17,792
You'll have to pay
dearly for this deal.

1095
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:23,000
-No.
-One second.

1096
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:24,667
No, Karina.

1097
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:26,250
It's mom.

1098
01:04:28,292 --> 01:04:31,417
<i>Hello, Mom.</i>
<i>Yeah, I am coming. I'm at Tina's.</i>

1099
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,833
And, what about the 400,000 cheque?

1100
01:04:37,042 --> 01:04:39,125
I'll get that.

1101
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:44,875
Perfect.

1102
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:54,083
Rashi, what are you doing?

1103
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:55,500
Why?

1104
01:04:58,125 --> 01:04:59,458
Can't I even kiss you now?

1105
01:04:59,542 --> 01:05:01,167
No, Rashi, but...

1106
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:06,500
-I am sorry, but you know.
-No, I am sorry.

1107
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:11,458
I've been chasing
the management for a week...

1108
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,917
so that you can get your cheque.

1109
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:16,208
When will I get the cheque?

1110
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:18,958
When will I get the cheque?

1111
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:21,667
Do you even remember that
it's my birthday on Sunday?

1112
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:23,500
I am absolutely alone now.

1113
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:28,000
-No one to celebrate with either.
-No, Rashi, it's not like that.

1114
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:29,208
So what is it?

1115
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:30,792
What can you do?

1116
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:33,833
Will you throw a surprise party for
me in front of your entire department?

1117
01:05:33,917 --> 01:05:35,708
-My department--
-Done.

1118
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,917
That's a great idea.

1119
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:39,417
Yeah.

1120
01:05:40,042 --> 01:05:42,958
You know, that way I'll
bond with some other people.

1121
01:05:43,792 --> 01:05:46,708
And I'll even handover your cheque.

1122
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:48,250
Return gift.

1123
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:52,000
I love surprises.

1124
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:55,083
Surprise!

1125
01:06:09,417 --> 01:06:12,375
I didn't let you
come close to me for three years.

1126
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:14,958
But, Rashi, we were quite close.

1127
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:16,625
But we didn't have sex, right?

1128
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,125
I was being loyal.

1129
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:22,708
And he's fooling around
with that white girl!

1130
01:06:22,792 --> 01:06:23,875
How do you--

1131
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:26,708
Synced emails.

1132
01:06:26,792 --> 01:06:28,458
Her name is Vannesa.

1133
01:06:29,167 --> 01:06:30,292
Vannesa!

1134
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,583
The emails are really
disturbing, Sanjay.

1135
01:06:32,792 --> 01:06:34,667
I don't want to live here anymore.

1136
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:38,542
I don't want Kashin's
obligations anymore.

1137
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,042
I've told Dad

1138
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,333
and he's looking
for a home in Bandra.

1139
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:50,167
All I need is a companion,
to share it with.

1140
01:06:50,542 --> 01:06:51,583
<i>Sanjay!</i>

1141
01:06:53,417 --> 01:06:54,583
Yeah.

1142
01:06:54,667 --> 01:06:56,958
Rashi ma'am...

1143
01:06:57,208 --> 01:06:59,167
if I could get my cheque.

1144
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:03,000
Sanjay, the entire house is a mess.
Will you give me a hand?

1145
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:04,708
Yeah. Let's do it together.

1146
01:07:04,792 --> 01:07:05,917
We'll get it done faster.

1147
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:07,458
-Sunny.
-Yes, ma'am.

1148
01:07:07,542 --> 01:07:10,000
You're drunk. You should go home.

1149
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:12,542
-We'll do it.
-Ma'am, I am a teetotaller.

1150
01:07:12,625 --> 01:07:13,500
Yeah.

1151
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:17,333
-Sunny.
-Yes, ma'am.

1152
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:20,708
You're drunk. You should go home now.

1153
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:22,625
Correct, ma'am.

1154
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:24,583
<i>"Everything's in order..."</i>

1155
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,958
No, I am really...

1156
01:07:31,292 --> 01:07:32,583
I was wrong, wasn't I?

1157
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:35,958
I didn't let you come close to me.

1158
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:38,792
Isn't that why you left me?

1159
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:42,583
What are you doing, Rashi?
I can't.

1160
01:07:42,667 --> 01:07:43,583
Why?

1161
01:07:45,042 --> 01:07:48,208
It was okay when I was
with someone else, right?

1162
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:50,417
And now when I need you

1163
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,833
you're pretending to be loyal?

1164
01:07:51,917 --> 01:07:53,708
Relax, it's just sex.

1165
01:07:54,292 --> 01:07:55,375
Sex?

1166
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:58,083
No, Rashi, I just want my cheque.

1167
01:08:06,042 --> 01:08:07,792
Come and get it.

1168
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,417

01:08:51,042 --> 01:08:55,000

1173
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:58,375

<i>Your phone was unreachable since morning.</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

1178

<i>Can you hear me? Hello?</i>

1179
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:10,333
Yeah, I got the cheque.

1180
01:09:10,417 --> 01:09:13,833
<i>That's fantastic, Sanjay!</i>
<i>Because we also won the house!</i>

1181
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:18,042
<i>It's the one we wanted,</i>
<i>on the top floor, Sanjay!</i>

1182
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:20,000
<i>Just like we had imagined.</i>

<i>The very same flat.</i>

01:09:22,292 --> 01:09:24,500
<i>You did it, Sanjay! You did it!</i>

1185
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:27,333
Yes, I did it.

1186
01:09:37,125 --> 01:09:42,458
Friends, a very dear friend
of mine is retiring today.

1187
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:46,250
<i>I've always been a fan</i>
<i>of his heavenly voice.</i>

1188
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,833
And so, I would request you...

1189
01:09:49,542 --> 01:09:51,708
to welcome him with
a huge round of applause.

1190
01:09:52,042 --> 01:09:53,833
Mr. Bhaskar Chaturvedi.

1191
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:06,792
I would request Bhaskar...

1192
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:09,667
to say a few words.

1193
01:10:17,417 --> 01:10:19,000
Ladies and Gentlemen...

1194
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,208
-Mr. Mishra.
-Yes.

1195
01:10:21,292 --> 01:10:22,875
-There are your few words.
-What are you saying?

1196
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:25,167
-Can I retire now?
-Not yet, please.

1197
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,042
Just a couple of words more.

1198
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:32,042
I've been observing
these railway tracks...

1199
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:37,250
for the past 30 years.

1200
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:40,292
They are like the
lines on your palms...

1201
01:10:40,542 --> 01:10:42,958
-which never fade away.
-Wow! What a thought!

1202
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:50,125
I came to Mumbai, 30 years ago

1203
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:51,667
to become a singer.

1204
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:55,000
But I became a railway
announcer instead.

1205
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,542
Yet, I don't have any regrets.

1206
01:10:58,667 --> 01:11:01,750
Because, I had a
pretty important job.

1207
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:03,917
That's what my wife says.

1208
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,792
She consoled me that I
had a pretty important job.

1209
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:12,708
We, at least, help the passengers

1210
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:15,750
to get one step closer
to their destination.

1211
01:11:16,792 --> 01:11:21,083
But the passengers,
are like our children.

1212
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:25,167
They yell and scream,
say absurd things, hurl abuses.

1213
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:28,167
In fact, they even quarrel with us.

1214
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:30,458
But I never had any
complaints with them.

1215
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:32,333
Our only advice to them is

1216
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:37,292
"Son, don't stand
on the wrong platform."

1217
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:42,500
"Or else you'll miss your train,
and you'll be left stranded forever."

1218
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:43,792
-Amazing thought
-Thank you.

1219
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:47,667
Hold on, just a minute.

1220
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,792
Bhaskar, please one last announcement.

1221
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:53,083
Mr. Mishra, I guess you
won't rest until I am dead.

1222
01:11:53,167 --> 01:11:54,375
No, no.

1223
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:55,625
Please.

1224
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:36,958
The ‘Fa’ key is working.

1225
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:52,583
<i>"I am just a traveler"</i>

1226
01:12:52,792 --> 01:12:58,000
<i>"Without a home, or a destination"</i>

1227
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:04,542
<i>"I've to keep walking"</i>

1228
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:11,000
<i>"Just keep walking"</i>

1229
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:13,917
Your attention please, passengers.

1230
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:18,458
22209 DN Duronto Express

1231
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:23,417
<i>will be arriving on platform number</i>
<i>9 instead of platform number 8.</i>

1232
01:13:25,583 --> 01:13:26,667
Thank you.

1233
01:13:31,292 --> 01:13:33,542
Do pay us a visit
whenever you're in Kanpur.

1234
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:34,667
Of course.

1235
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:36,625
<i>Yeah and don't make excuses.</i>

1236
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:38,833
What the hell are you saying!

1237
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,375
I knew it that very night...

1238
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:45,750
-I was only there to collect my cheque.
-Who told you to mate after that?

1239
01:13:45,917 --> 01:13:48,583
Stop cracking stupid jokes
and help me out.

1240
01:13:50,542 --> 01:13:51,625
Tina.

1241
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:56,458
-I'll tell Karina everything.
-Absolutely.

1242
01:13:56,667 --> 01:13:58,083
You shouldn't hide this.

1243
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,792
Hey! Hello?

1244
01:14:00,125 --> 01:14:02,625
Your dreams will come crashing down.

1245
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:05,833
You can forget the house,
the king-size bed, and lots of...

1246
01:14:06,292 --> 01:14:10,792
-And Tina, what if I tell you everything
-Then we'll break up.

1247
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:12,750
Then why are you giving
him such a stupid idea?

1248
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:17,583
What if tomorrow, I tell
you that I got drunk and stupid?

1249
01:14:17,667 --> 01:14:19,167
Then I'll say why did you tell me?

1250
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:20,250
What are you saying?

1251
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:22,458
What is he saying?
Are you out of your mind?

1252
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:23,583
Sanjay!

1253
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,208
Look, maybe Karina will break up
with you after hearing the truth.

1254
01:14:28,542 --> 01:14:31,125
-And you might even lose your home.
-Of course.

1255
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:33,917
But, are you willing to
form your relationship

1256
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,750
with Karina on the basis
of a lie, for a house?

1257
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:39,833
Take my advice and be honest with her.

1258
01:14:44,542 --> 01:14:46,500
A cheque for 400,000!

1259
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:49,333
A cheque for 400,000.

1260
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,667
Where the hell did you keep this?

1261
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:55,583
Well, at least you got it.

1262
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,083
Like I said, Sanjay...

1263
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:01,083
we'll celebrate when
you'll get the house.

1264
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:03,250
<i>Not with chocolates.</i>

1265
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:05,542
We'll celebrate with
chocolate brownies.

1266
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:09,167
-What's a brownie?
-These are brownies. I made these.

1267
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:10,500
Looks tempting.

1268
01:15:10,583 --> 01:15:11,875
Gotya, what are you doing?

1269
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:13,708
Go give the cheque to Mrs. Deshpande.

1270
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:14,708
Take it, take it.

1271
01:15:14,792 --> 01:15:17,292
Run! Run!

1272
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:22,417
Sanjay, now you better
get married in two weeks.

1273
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:24,167
And, throw a wedding party.

1274
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,208
Your families must be really happy.

1275
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:32,292
Karina, we need to...

1276
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:34,792
Karina, everything that happened...

1277
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:39,042
Like the Jeevan Saathi lucky draw,
the house, the kiss...

1278
01:15:40,042 --> 01:15:42,417
We didn't get any
time to discuss about it.

1279
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:50,167
And we...
You know, it's not a deal.

1280
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,167
So, I was thinking

1281
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:56,708
that there are some things
I want to share with you.

1282
01:15:57,042 --> 01:15:58,750
-I mean--
-Sanjay...

1283
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:03,625
My home.

1284
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:11,292
My name's on it. Karina D'Souza.

1285
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:15,292
My dream.

1286
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:17,625
Our dream.

1287
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,458
Look, Sanjay Chaturvedi.

1288
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:27,167
-Aren't you happy?
-Yeah, of course, I am. Very!

1289
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:31,042
And that's why, Karina,
I was saying that...

1290
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:34,583
we're going to start anew, you know.

1291
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:38,375
So I want to tell you
everything about my past.

1292
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,208
Mom.

1293
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:42,625
Hi, Mom.

1294
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:44,458
Yeah.

1295
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:48,708
Mom, I...
I am coming.

1296
01:16:49,292 --> 01:16:50,667
Yeah, I am coming.

1297
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:58,042
Sanjay Chaturvedi,
congratulations for the home!

1298
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:03,042
6:30 p.m...

1299
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:04,625
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

1300
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:09,583
-Hi.
-Hi.

1301
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:18,125
Rashi, what are you doing?

1302
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:20,375
Kashin and I broke up.

1303
01:17:22,042 --> 01:17:25,625
-I told him everything about us.
-Told him what?

1304
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:28,917
-This.
-Rashi!

1305
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:31,625
Now Kashin will never interfere.

1306
01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:34,292
-This...
-It's just you and me now.

1307
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,417
Rashi, I got that
home in the lucky draw.

1308
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,167
Do you remember, I had applied for
the home loan? It got approved.

1309
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:44,583
-So now, I just need to get married.
-I know.

1310
01:17:45,042 --> 01:17:46,917
You made a deal with
that girl for the house.

1311
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:47,958
What is her name?

1312
01:17:48,042 --> 01:17:49,958
-Kari--
-Anyway, it doesn't matter.

1313
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:53,625
I know you always dreamed
of buying your own home.

1314
01:17:54,167 --> 01:17:55,958
Isn't that why you're
doing all this, Sanju?

1315
01:17:56,042 --> 01:17:57,458
The marriage, the loan.

1316
01:17:58,792 --> 01:18:00,333
We do have our own home now.

1317
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:03,208
And, it's much bigger
than that cheap pigeon-hole.

1318
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:06,792
Our names will be on the agreement.

1319
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:10,833
Okay, we'll transfer
it to your name if you want.

1320
01:18:11,042 --> 01:18:12,417
No biggie.

1321
01:18:15,167 --> 01:18:17,583
Rashi, let's not hold up the lift.

1322
01:18:17,667 --> 01:18:19,000
What will people think?

1323
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:20,042
Sanjay!

1324
01:18:20,833 --> 01:18:22,375
What are you thinking?

1325
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,583
Wasn't this your dream?

1326
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:28,375
You've always wanted me,
and now you have me

1327
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:29,875
and now I love you!

1328
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:33,042
What is the problem?

1329
01:18:36,542 --> 01:18:38,292
I don't love you, Rashi.

1330
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:48,167
And you love her.

1331
01:18:55,792 --> 01:18:57,875
-What's this?
-It's a letter.

1332
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:00,375
-You read it?
-I also read it.

1333
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:03,500
-What's wrong with you?
-Yeah, Karina, what's wrong with you?

1334
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:05,167
-What's wrong with you?
-What's wrong with you?

1335
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:07,042
Everybody stop saying
"What's wrong with you?"

1336
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:08,375
You answer me, Karina, first.

1337
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:10,333
Karina, talk to me.

1338
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:11,500
We love each other.

1339
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:13,292
You didn't even come
with me to Imphal.

1340
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:15,125
I don't want to go to Imphal with you.

1341
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:16,417
I don't want to go anywhere with you.

1342
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,000
Mom, we discussed this before.

1343
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:19,125
I need my own space.

1344
01:19:19,208 --> 01:19:21,333
I cannot live with your parents,
I need to make my own decision.

1345
01:19:21,417 --> 01:19:23,708
-I have a career to think about.
-But, my girl--

1346
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,583
And, Mom, I may not be
able to save this world

1347
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:27,542
but I need to be
responsible for my own life.

1348
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:29,250
And, Sam, I don't love you!

1349
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,250
I don't think I ever did.

1350
01:19:33,458 --> 01:19:37,167
-Then what were you doing for so long?
-Mom, it was just a compromise.

1351
01:19:37,333 --> 01:19:39,042
You look like you're more
in love with him than I am.

1352
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:39,958
There is nothing between us.

1353
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:42,167
-No love, no sex.
-Enough now, enough!

1354
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:44,083
-You're talking rubbish!
-What rubbish I am talking?

1355
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:45,000
Tell her, if I am
talking rubbish.

1356
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:47,000
Karina, you know we
can't do it before marriage.

1357
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:49,667
Everybody, please stop talking
about S-E-X.

1358
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,375
And I gave you your own space.

1359
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:52,750
I gave you 'Kar-Sam'.

1360
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:55,542
And, Aunty, after marriage we
can have as much S-E-X as you want.

1361
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:58,750
Stop it! Sam, stop it!

1362
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:02,417
-Karina--
-Mom, I'm getting married to Sanjay.

1363
01:20:03,542 --> 01:20:06,833
Sanjay? Who is Sanjay now?

1364
01:20:07,042 --> 01:20:08,417
Yeah, who is Sanjay now?

1365
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:10,000
Again you're repeating
what I'm saying.

1366
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:11,958
I am getting irritated.
Who is Sanjay?

1367
01:20:12,042 --> 01:20:13,333
-Sam!
-Sam! Sam!

1368
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:16,292
-Sam, listen.
-Sam! Sam! Sam!

1369
01:20:16,667 --> 01:20:19,458
I am really sorry about all this.

1370
01:20:19,542 --> 01:20:20,958
You're a very nice guy.

1371
01:20:21,042 --> 01:20:23,292
It's just that, we're
two very different people

1372
01:20:23,375 --> 01:20:25,458
wanting different things from life.

1373
01:20:25,625 --> 01:20:28,542
You want a Mrs. Masqita, right?

1374
01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:31,167
Who'll take care of your home,
take care of your parents.

1375
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:32,333
Who'll take care of you.

1376
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:35,458
But I can't be that person.

1377
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:39,958
-I am sure you'll find someone.
-It's okay.

1378
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:41,750
Sam...

1379
01:20:43,458 --> 01:20:47,708
Aunty, I gave it my best.
But you broke my heart.

1380
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:51,000
I am angry.
I am upset.

1381
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:53,333
I am shattered.

1382
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:57,375
But I don't just say anything...

1383
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,792
that I am going
to regret in the future.

1384
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:01,667
Best of luck with your life...

1385
01:21:02,667 --> 01:21:05,708
-and that Hindu boy of yours.
-Sam!

1386
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,583
-What's the name of that fellow?
-Mom...

1387
01:21:12,708 --> 01:21:15,042
-I'll... I'll tell you.
-You said, Sanjay, right?

1388
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:17,167
-Sanjay what?
-Sit.

1389
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:18,375
What?

1390
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:22,500
Sanjay Chaturvedi.

1391
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:23,458
Chaturvedi?

1392
01:21:23,542 --> 01:21:24,917
What's Chaturvedi?

1393
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:27,875
-He's a Hindu?
-Mom...

1394
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:30,792
-Oh my Jesus!
-Mom!

1395
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:34,000
What you simply...
Your blood pressure will go up, Mom!

1396
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:35,667
Then why are you doing this to me?

1397
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,167
Do you want to kill me or what?

1398
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:39,250
-Mom, I...
-Such a good Christian boy.

1399
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:40,667
Mom, I love Sanjay.

1400
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:43,000
I love him.
I can actually see myself

1401
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:45,125
spending a lifetime with him,
not with Sam.

1402
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:46,667
As nice as he is.

1403
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:48,167
You wanted a decent boy, right?

1404
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:50,542
-You wanted a decent boy.
-Yes.

1405
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:52,042
Sanjay is that guy, Mom.

1406
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:54,333
He sees the world as I do.

1407
01:21:54,417 --> 01:21:56,250
And, we even got a home loan together.

1408
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:58,500
We applied for a house together
and we got it.

1409
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:00,708
Oh my Jesus!

1410
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,125
Mom?

1411
01:22:02,625 --> 01:22:03,583
Mom?

1412
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:05,375
Mommy?
Mom?

1413
01:22:05,458 --> 01:22:07,375
Don't worry, I am not
going to die so soon.

1414
01:22:09,667 --> 01:22:11,792
First I want to see that boy of yours.

1415
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:15,250
Since when did you become friendly to him?

1416
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:17,417
Since one month, Aunty.

1417
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:23,333
And when did you apply
for a house together?

1418
01:22:23,417 --> 01:22:24,417
Two days ago.

1419
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:27,542
And, when did you two fall in love,
this morning?

1420
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:28,500
Mom!

1421
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:33,458
I got some chicken patice,
he'll eat, right?

1422
01:22:33,542 --> 01:22:34,708
No, Aunty, I'm a vegetarian.

1423
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:37,750
And fish?

1424
01:22:40,292 --> 01:22:41,583
No, Aunty.

1425
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:43,750
But she loves fish.

1426
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,375
-My Jesus, you're going to convert--
-No, Mom.

1427
01:22:47,458 --> 01:22:48,292
No, Aunty.

1428
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:49,583
-And children.
-Whose?

1429
01:22:49,667 --> 01:22:51,375
Mom, can you please stop this now?

1430
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:55,875
No, I won't stop it. You've to
ask all these things from the beginning.

1431
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:59,208
He's from another religion.

1432
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:01,167
Do you know how they live?

1433
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:02,500
Their customs.

1434
01:23:03,792 --> 01:23:05,833
It's one thing to fall
in love with them, but

1435
01:23:06,417 --> 01:23:08,417
another thing to live with them.

1436
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:14,875
-Children...
-Children, Aunty?

1437
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:19,375
-Will he be a Hindu, or a Christian?
-We'll figure it out later, Mom.

1438
01:23:19,917 --> 01:23:22,917
Later when? When it's too late?

1439
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:31,000
-Do you believe in God?
-No, Aunty, I am not much of a believer.

1440
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,042
Good, she doesn't either.

1441
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:37,208
Can we please stop this
interrogation, Mom?

1442
01:23:37,292 --> 01:23:38,750
No, we cannot!

1443
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:41,083
What will I say to Father Lori?

1444
01:23:43,792 --> 01:23:47,042
First she was friendly to Sam.
Then she broke off with him.

1445
01:23:47,125 --> 01:23:49,208
Now she's friendly
to one Hindu boy.

1446
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,583
-Look, Sanjeev--
-Sanjay, Aunty.

1447
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,250
Sanjay.

1448
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:58,625
You two have already decided everything.

1449
01:24:00,042 --> 01:24:02,583
About your marriage and everything else.

1450
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,792
But that's not how we do things.

1451
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:09,458
I've made a lot of sacrifices for her...

1452
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:12,583
but she ignored all of it.

1453
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:17,125
Maybe she doesn't care for me.

1454
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:19,833
But, she's my only child.

1455
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:23,292
If anything happens to her,
what am I going to do?

1456
01:24:23,375 --> 01:24:25,500
-Mom...
-Aunty...

1457
01:24:27,542 --> 01:24:32,833
I am a Chaturvedi,
and she is a D'Souza.

1458
01:24:34,417 --> 01:24:37,875
I like cottage cheese
and she loves fish.

1459
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:42,042
But that will never come between us.

1460
01:24:42,792 --> 01:24:46,292
We'll take really
good care of each other.

1461
01:24:46,542 --> 01:24:50,500
I mean, we'll probably
quarrel sometimes.

1462
01:24:50,583 --> 01:24:51,417
Maybe.

1463
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:55,208
But the reason will never be our
religion and that's my promise, Aunty.

1464
01:24:55,792 --> 01:25:00,667
And our children can worship Jesus,
or Lord Hanuman, or Sachin Tendulkar.

1465
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:03,125
We'll let the kids decide that.

1466
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:07,667
Aunty, for now we just
want to get married.

1467
01:25:08,542 --> 01:25:09,500
That's it.

1468
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:12,583
And we only need your blessings.

1469
01:25:18,375 --> 01:25:21,542
-Did you take your parents' blessings?
-Of course, Aunty.

1470
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:26,958
I'll never allow
a meat-eater in my home.

1471
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:31,208
When did you do this? This?

1472
01:25:32,583 --> 01:25:34,083
Will it be in your name?

1473
01:25:35,125 --> 01:25:37,500
Yours and that girl's?

1474
01:25:37,667 --> 01:25:40,333
Did you read her name? D'Souza.

1475
01:25:40,667 --> 01:25:42,625
Why are you saying that?

1476
01:25:43,167 --> 01:25:44,625
I thought you will be happy.

1477
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:45,958
Why tell us now?

1478
01:25:46,042 --> 01:25:47,792
You could've told us
after you two got married.

1479
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:49,042
"You'll be happy!"

1480
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:50,917
Did you two get married?

1481
01:25:52,958 --> 01:25:54,000
<i>Did you?</i>

1482
01:25:55,167 --> 01:25:57,750
If I had, then why would I be introducing
you two to her mother, tomorrow?

1483
01:25:57,833 --> 01:26:00,417
-Where did you meet her?
-At my office.

1484
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:03,500
-Is she fair?
-See for yourself, tomorrow.

1485
01:26:03,583 --> 01:26:05,583
I know all about your dream home.

1486
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:08,875
But why borrow from someone else?

1487
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:10,708
Why didn't you come to me?

1488
01:26:10,792 --> 01:26:13,000
I could have given you the money.

1489
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:14,792
You fool!

1490
01:26:15,917 --> 01:26:18,542
You never did anything
when you had a job.

1491
01:26:18,792 --> 01:26:20,875
Stop bragging after you're retired.

1492
01:26:21,625 --> 01:26:22,625
Hey!

1493
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:24,375
Don't change sides.

1494
01:26:24,458 --> 01:26:26,667
Nothing like this has
ever happened in our family.

1495
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:31,958
The Chaturvedi family name
makes the headlines every day, doesn’t it?

1496
01:26:32,458 --> 01:26:35,833
Don't be angry. What's done is done.

1497
01:26:36,542 --> 01:26:39,208
Accept it as God's will.

1498
01:26:39,667 --> 01:26:40,500
<i>And you...</i>

1499
01:26:40,958 --> 01:26:42,250
<i>don't be upset.</i>

1500
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:43,500
<i>Come here.</i>

1501
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:49,625
You're the first Chaturvedi
in four generations

1502
01:26:49,833 --> 01:26:52,375
who will have his own home.

1503
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:54,500
Stop cursing Chaturvedis.

1504
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:57,167
This boy will humiliate us some day.

1505
01:26:57,250 --> 01:27:01,708
-Papa, at least meet her once.
-I don't want to meet anyone.

1506
01:27:01,958 --> 01:27:06,625
<i>"The blushing eyes"</i>

1507
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:11,833
<i>"The glasses filled to the brim"</i>

1508
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:18,458
<i>"Let me drink"</i>

1509
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:24,333
<i>"Tomorrow's so unpredictable"</i>

1510
01:27:25,042 --> 01:27:30,958
<i>"Let me be fearless tonight"</i>

1511
01:27:31,042 --> 01:27:38,958
<i>"Let me live freely tonight"</i>

1512
01:27:39,625 --> 01:27:41,833
So lovely!

1513
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:46,500
-You've got a great voice.
-Thank you!

1514
01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:49,750
Why do I feel that I've
heard your voice before?

1515
01:27:50,667 --> 01:27:52,500
Does he sing on the radio?

1516
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:54,292
Not the radio.

1517
01:27:54,542 --> 01:27:56,958
Then why do I think I've heard...

1518
01:27:57,042 --> 01:28:01,042
You must have heard
his voice at Dadar train station.

1519
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:03,042
He was a Railway Announcer.

1520
01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:04,083
Oh!

1521
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:07,625
Right, of course.

1522
01:28:07,792 --> 01:28:09,667
Of course, of course, yes.

1523
01:28:09,958 --> 01:28:13,125
Every time I traveled
from Mezgaon to Maim--

1524
01:28:13,208 --> 01:28:15,250
-Mazgaon to Mahim
-In the train, yes.

1525
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:17,167
That's where I heard your voice.

1526
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:19,875
It sounded very different.

1527
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:23,292
Not like those lady announcers.

1528
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:25,958
The train at platform number 9...

1529
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:28,917
So irritating, like crows.

1530
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:30,625
-Crows!
-Crows!

1531
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:32,125
Crow!

1532
01:28:33,583 --> 01:28:35,167
She referred to them as crows!

1533
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:40,292
Please try this, I made these.

1534
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,542
Brownies.
Egg-less, it's egg-less.

1535
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:44,458
Here you go.

1536
01:28:45,958 --> 01:28:47,042
You also have.

1537
01:28:47,292 --> 01:28:50,708
Mrs. D'Souza,
it was really fun meeting you.

1538
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:52,167
And, Karishma, dear.

1539
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:54,542
-It's Karina--
-I'm even more happy to meet you.

1540
01:28:55,042 --> 01:28:58,042
But we're strictly vegetarians.

1541
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:01,250
Yes, and we're strictly
non-vegetarians.

1542
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:03,167
No one eats vegetarian food?

1543
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:05,208
Then how is this going to work?

1544
01:29:05,292 --> 01:29:08,125
Right, that's what I told her.
How will this work?

1545
01:29:08,208 --> 01:29:10,708
Well, they will build
their own little home.

1546
01:29:10,792 --> 01:29:12,792
And their own ground rules. So what?

1547
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:14,875
Their home? Their home?

1548
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:16,833
And if they don't have a home,
won't they get married?

1549
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:19,667
-No, uncle. That's not it.
-Then what?

1550
01:29:20,208 --> 01:29:21,500
He is right.

1551
01:29:21,958 --> 01:29:24,167
Won't you two get married
if you don't have a home?

1552
01:29:24,583 --> 01:29:26,875
Are you marrying for
the flat, or for love?

1553
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:28,792
-You both love each other, right?
-Of course, I do.

1554
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:30,167
I love him, Mom.

1555
01:29:31,208 --> 01:29:34,417
-Sanju, you say it too.
-Huh?

1556
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:35,708
What huh?

1557
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:38,917
He's exactly like his father.

1558
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:43,875
Blossom, don't you worry at all.

1559
01:29:43,958 --> 01:29:45,417
Congratulations.

1560
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:47,250
Sorry, Mrs. Chaturvedi.

1561
01:29:47,333 --> 01:29:50,042
But no one in my family has
ever got married like this.

1562
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:52,833
Nobody in our family either, but...

1563
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:56,208
When the husband and wife are ready, what
can the Qazi do?

1564
01:29:56,833 --> 01:29:59,083
-Qazi?
-Priest.

1565
01:30:00,917 --> 01:30:03,500
<i>Let's go to Mrs. D'souza's home and</i>

1566
01:30:03,583 --> 01:30:04,958
<i>light the holy lantern of good luck.</i>

1567
01:30:05,042 --> 01:30:07,750
<i>-Then we'll discuss further.</i>
<i>-Absolutely.</i>

1568
01:30:07,833 --> 01:30:10,250
<i>I have to talk to Father Lori.</i>

1569
01:30:11,125 --> 01:30:12,125
<i>Come.</i>

1570
01:30:12,208 --> 01:30:15,542
-Karina, listen--
-Stop, stop, stop here.

1571
01:30:16,417 --> 01:30:17,250
Don't open your eyes.

1572
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:18,875
Don't open your eyes.

1573
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:27,417
Welcome to the Chaturvedi
And D'Souza residency.

1574
01:30:29,292 --> 01:30:30,333
Ta-dah!

1575
01:30:31,167 --> 01:30:34,208
There was an auction at the church of
the furniture from the old Parish

1576
01:30:34,292 --> 01:30:35,667
and I bought all of it.

1577
01:30:36,333 --> 01:30:37,542
What do you think?

1578
01:30:38,417 --> 01:30:41,458
Bed. Fridge.

1579
01:30:41,542 --> 01:30:45,708
TV is your responsibility.

1580
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:47,042
Why?

1581
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:50,625
Because we must share
everything 50-50.

1582
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:53,458
Isn't that right, Mr. Chaturvedi?

1583
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,625
Come.

1584
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:12,750
I still don't remember
what had happened.

1585
01:31:14,708 --> 01:31:16,875
But I didn't want to
hide anything from you.

1586
01:31:22,625 --> 01:31:24,333
-Karina, I love--
-Stop!

1587
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,167
Don't say it.

1588
01:31:32,542 --> 01:31:33,958
I got carried away.

1589
01:31:36,583 --> 01:31:39,542
My dream, my independence...

1590
01:31:42,417 --> 01:31:43,292
And then...

1591
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:48,500
Let's keep this as a deal.

1592
01:31:49,958 --> 01:31:52,167
And not get into the hassles of love.

1593
01:31:57,958 --> 01:31:59,833
Now if I tell Mom...

1594
01:32:01,875 --> 01:32:03,917
Shit! Sanjay!

1595
01:32:05,792 --> 01:32:06,750
Shit!

1596
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:14,042
-Sanjay, you made me dependent again.
-No, Karina.

1597
01:32:14,542 --> 01:32:15,667
Karina, girl.

1598
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:18,083
<i>Come here.</i>

1599
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:19,917
Come.

1600
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:23,458
-So that's what the furniture is for?
-Yeah.

1601
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:31,583
Come.

1602
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:39,542
-And this is Sanjay...
-Chaturvedi.

1603
01:32:39,625 --> 01:32:41,625
<i>-Nice to meet you, Sanjay.</i>
<i>-Same here, Father.</i>

1604
01:32:41,708 --> 01:32:43,750
<i>So Mum's telling me that</i>
<i>you two work together.</i>

1605
01:32:43,833 --> 01:32:46,333
<i>-What do you do, Sanjay?</i>
<i>-I am a software engineer.</i>

1606
01:32:48,292 --> 01:32:51,625
Admitting honestly doesn't
make the crime forgivable.

1607
01:32:51,958 --> 01:32:52,875
How convenient!

1608
01:32:53,083 --> 01:32:55,875
First, you kill someone,
and then confess honestly

1609
01:32:56,125 --> 01:32:57,375
so you should be forgiven.

1610
01:32:57,542 --> 01:33:01,542
It was a stupid mistake. An accident.
And these things do happen, right?

1611
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:05,750
Even you ended up on
Sanjay's terrace, accidentally.

1612
01:33:06,542 --> 01:33:09,208
You kissed him while you
were seeing someone, right?

1613
01:33:10,917 --> 01:33:12,333
That was different.

1614
01:33:12,708 --> 01:33:14,292
I wrote everything
in the letter to Samuel.

1615
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:16,125
Really? Letter?

1616
01:33:17,875 --> 01:33:18,958
What do you...

1617
01:33:21,292 --> 01:33:23,708
What do you mean? Huh?

1618
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:28,083
Him cheating on me is justified?
It's fine?

1619
01:33:29,042 --> 01:33:32,625
-I deserve this.
-No, you deserve better.

1620
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:35,250
You deserve that house.
You deserve Sanjay.

1621
01:33:36,625 --> 01:33:39,667
But don't ruin everything
for a stupid mistake.

1622
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,875
Don't forgive him so easily.

1623
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:49,542
Let him feel guilty for a while.

1624
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:51,542
He should be shit scared!

1625
01:33:52,375 --> 01:33:53,833
And then you can forgive him.

1626
01:33:55,917 --> 01:33:58,583
Now, do I send this
form ahead, or not?

1627
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:02,542
D'souza-Chaturvedi Residence.

1628
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:04,417
Here.
Right here.

1629
01:34:04,667 --> 01:34:05,750
Move aside, will you?

1630
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:07,000
Wait! Just wait!

1631
01:34:07,083 --> 01:34:08,083
-Wait!
-I said move.

1632
01:34:08,167 --> 01:34:10,167
Or else D'Souza and
Chaturvedi will fall down.

1633
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:11,083
Now I'll have to move

1634
01:34:11,167 --> 01:34:14,208
or she will spill
the color on my clothes.

1635
01:34:14,292 --> 01:34:15,875
-Perfect.
-Come, son.

1636
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:20,667
-What does she have to do?
-Kick it.

1637
01:34:20,917 --> 01:34:22,208
Kick it?

1638
01:34:22,292 --> 01:34:23,500
Yes, kick.

1639
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:25,750
I mean you just need to topple it.

1640
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:27,000
Come on.

1641
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:29,250
No, no.
That's bad omen.

1642
01:34:30,875 --> 01:34:32,000
Use your right leg.

1643
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:34,083
-Is your daughter lefty?
-No, no.

1644
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:36,458
Karina, right.

1645
01:34:41,833 --> 01:34:43,167
Congratulations.

1646
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:46,125
-I guess that's too much force.
-She played football in school.

1647
01:34:46,875 --> 01:34:49,167
She broke all the records. Amazing!

1648
01:34:57,292 --> 01:34:58,875
No!

1649
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:01,250
Sorry, sorry.

1650
01:35:09,833 --> 01:35:10,917
<i>No, Rehmat.</i>

1651
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,333
He's my only son.

1652
01:35:12,417 --> 01:35:14,667
I don't like this idea
of getting married in the court.

1653
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,667
As Rehmat said earlier

1654
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:20,042
the last day to submit the marriage
certificate is the day after tomorrow.

1655
01:35:20,167 --> 01:35:22,500
Once their marriage is registered

1656
01:35:22,708 --> 01:35:24,833
we'll have a grand wedding later.

1657
01:35:25,208 --> 01:35:26,917
-Right.
-Yes, that's right.

1658
01:35:27,458 --> 01:35:30,167
Sorry, I heard "grand wedding."

1659
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:33,458
But Karina doesn't like any of that,
you know.

1660
01:35:33,542 --> 01:35:36,333
We have very simple weddings.

1661
01:35:37,292 --> 01:35:38,958
Sanjay also doesn't want.

1662
01:35:39,042 --> 01:35:41,042
Fine, we'll have a simple wedding.

1663
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:43,542
A handful of guests from your side,
and a few from ours.

1664
01:35:43,625 --> 01:35:45,625
-Food, drinks and trumpets.
-Band?

1665
01:35:45,708 --> 01:35:48,875
What are you saying? How can
we have trumpets blaring at the court?

1666
01:35:48,958 --> 01:35:52,083
We'll call the registrar
at a wedding hall.

1667
01:35:52,167 --> 01:35:54,083
How will you get a hall in two days?

1668
01:35:54,167 --> 01:35:55,458
This isn't Kanpur

1669
01:35:55,542 --> 01:35:58,000
where you can get married
in your own courtyard.

1670
01:35:58,750 --> 01:36:02,625
-Sister, what an idea.
-Huh?

1671
01:36:02,708 --> 01:36:07,708
Just say the word, and we'll get
them married in their own courtyard.

1672
01:36:08,125 --> 01:36:10,208
Yeah. Here?

1673
01:36:10,292 --> 01:36:12,625
Yes, that will be great.

1674
01:36:12,708 --> 01:36:15,917
They will get married right here,
and settle down here.

1675
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,417
But don't tell those idiots. Or
else they will meddle with our plans.

1676
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:22,083
-It will be a surprise.
-Surprise, right.

1677
01:36:22,167 --> 01:36:24,292
And it'll be really simple, right?

1678
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:27,542
What's backyard?

1679
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:31,292
Karina.

1680
01:36:31,375 --> 01:36:33,375
Sanjay, I don't want to
talk about it right now.

1681
01:36:33,458 --> 01:36:34,292
What is this?

1682
01:36:34,375 --> 01:36:36,250
Karina, I want to marry you.

1683
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,375
And I really want to marry
you. Not this charade.

1684
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:42,208
Not by lying to everyone. This deal...

1685
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:44,125
This is not how I want to do it.

1686
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:46,167
I want a proper one, please.

1687
01:36:46,458 --> 01:36:47,625
No, I...

1688
01:36:47,833 --> 01:36:50,542
-I don't want to do this.
-Karina.

1689
01:36:52,958 --> 01:36:55,167
Karina, will you...

1690
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,583
You already laid down your weapons?

1691
01:37:00,167 --> 01:37:03,250
Come, dear, we must get
on with the rituals. Come on.

1692
01:37:09,667 --> 01:37:11,500
-What is it?
<i>-Come down to the office right now.</i>

1693
01:37:11,583 --> 01:37:13,375
<i>-I must talk to you.</i>
-I can't come now.

1694
01:37:13,458 --> 01:37:16,792
-I have a house-warming--
<i>-It's about the night we had sex.</i>

1695
01:37:18,417 --> 01:37:20,167
-Hello?
-How about my stole?

1696
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:21,333
Yes. Yes, it will do.

1697
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:24,958
It's a ritual.

1698
01:37:25,042 --> 01:37:28,708
And after this ritual,
she's no longer your daughter.

1699
01:37:28,958 --> 01:37:33,750
It's just like giving token at the
time of house registration.

1700
01:37:37,083 --> 01:37:40,167
-I had a dream.
-What dream?

1701
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:46,750
A child... in my womb.

1702
01:37:50,042 --> 01:37:51,042
Is that it?

1703
01:37:52,042 --> 01:37:55,042
I mean, did you call me
down here to tell me this dream?

1704
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,833
-Rashi, I left my house--
-Sanjay, I haven't got my periods.

1705
01:38:03,542 --> 01:38:04,542
What?

1706
01:38:05,125 --> 01:38:08,667
No, no, no.
Rashi, I remember, that night...

1707
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:10,792
That night...

1708
01:38:12,167 --> 01:38:13,708
Rashi, it's a bad dream.

1709
01:38:13,875 --> 01:38:15,000
Just a bad dream, forget everything.

1710
01:38:15,083 --> 01:38:16,458
You don't remember anything.

1711
01:38:16,542 --> 01:38:19,625
You were so drunk that night
and you didn't even use protection.

1712
01:38:20,125 --> 01:38:20,958
No.

1713
01:38:23,167 --> 01:38:25,875
No, this can't happen to me.

1714
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:26,792
Yeah.

1715
01:38:26,875 --> 01:38:29,542
-What's going to happen to me?
-Relax, it's not what you think.

1716
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:31,167
How do you know?

1717
01:38:32,792 --> 01:38:35,250
Fix an appointment
with a good gynecologist.

1718
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:37,708
-We'll go together.
-Why me?

1719
01:38:37,792 --> 01:38:40,292
-Because you're going to be a father.
-I am not going to be anyone's father.

1720
01:38:40,375 --> 01:38:43,000
Sanjay Chaturvedi,
this is your responsibility!

1721
01:39:04,542 --> 01:39:06,250
-First time?
-What?

1722
01:39:06,875 --> 01:39:08,625
Is this your first time?

1723
01:39:10,708 --> 01:39:15,708
-This is my fourth.
-Congratulations.

1724
01:39:15,792 --> 01:39:18,125
It's only for the first time...

1725
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:20,417
you know, the bleeding,
the delivery, the puking.

1726
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:23,417
-After that, it's rather convenient.
-Okay.

1727
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:29,583
-Your wife is really gorgeous.
-No... yes...

1728
01:39:29,833 --> 01:39:31,042
But she's really weak.

1729
01:39:31,833 --> 01:39:34,792
You must tell her to stop
dieting in this condition.

1730
01:39:34,875 --> 01:39:35,708
She must eat properly.

1731
01:39:35,792 --> 01:39:37,625
We're not sure yet.

1732
01:39:38,125 --> 01:39:40,417
You will be. I'll pray to God.

1733
01:39:40,583 --> 01:39:43,375
100 percent, you'll
get your baby too.

1734
01:39:43,458 --> 01:39:45,917
Thank you, doctor.
Thank you so much.

1735
01:39:53,042 --> 01:39:54,083
Baby.

1736
01:39:57,292 --> 01:39:58,292
Daddy.

1737
01:40:00,667 --> 01:40:02,125
Congratulations.

1738
01:40:02,458 --> 01:40:03,583
No! You don't get it.

1739
01:40:03,667 --> 01:40:05,083
-Where's the report?
-This is...

1740
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:07,792
But there's no harm
in getting a second opinion.

1741
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:09,625
Don't you trust me?
Don't you trust me?

1742
01:40:09,708 --> 01:40:11,125
You didn't let me meet the doctor.

1743
01:40:11,208 --> 01:40:13,458
-You know, last night I felt something.
-What?

1744
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:16,125
I think our baby was kicking me.

1745
01:40:16,708 --> 01:40:18,167
It was really painful, Sanjay.

1746
01:40:18,333 --> 01:40:20,417
You've got gas.

1747
01:40:20,583 --> 01:40:21,583
How is it possible?

1748
01:40:21,667 --> 01:40:22,833
I mean, I am not God

1749
01:40:22,917 --> 01:40:24,625
to bless you with a ready-made kid.

1750
01:40:25,417 --> 01:40:28,958
It's a child, not a money plant
to grow fully in a week.

1751
01:40:29,042 --> 01:40:30,208
Move your hand, it's nothing.

1752
01:40:30,292 --> 01:40:32,792
Sanjay, stop it!
You're hurting our baby.

1753
01:40:32,875 --> 01:40:34,250
There is no baby.

1754
01:40:34,333 --> 01:40:36,750
Ma'am, plan B.

1755
01:40:37,667 --> 01:40:38,667
Hi.

1756
01:40:40,083 --> 01:40:42,500
Karina, they are having a meeting
about 'Project Baby'. Let's go.

1757
01:40:46,792 --> 01:40:48,167
<i>-Karina!</i>
<i>-Karina!</i>

1758
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:50,958
Karina, stay away from him.
He's a cheater.

1759
01:40:51,042 --> 01:40:52,917
-He's the father of my child.
-Rashi, shut up!

1760
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,417
Karina, she's lying. I swear.

1761
01:40:54,542 --> 01:40:56,083
We just went to see a gynecologist.

1762
01:40:56,167 --> 01:40:57,375
I am pregnant with his child.

1763
01:40:57,458 --> 01:40:59,417
I think it's a boy and
I'll name him--

1764
01:40:59,542 --> 01:41:00,375
Hi, Kashin.

1765
01:41:03,833 --> 01:41:05,833
<i>-Stop it!</i>
<i>-Run, Sanjay!</i>

1766
01:41:08,167 --> 01:41:09,000
Kashin...

1767
01:41:09,542 --> 01:41:10,583
<i>Run, Sanjay!</i>

1768
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:13,208
<i>Kashin...</i>
<i>Kashin, listen to me.</i>

1769
01:41:13,625 --> 01:41:15,833
I was lying, I am not pregnant.

1770
01:41:15,917 --> 01:41:18,458
-She was lying, she's not... What?
-Don't lie!

1771
01:41:18,542 --> 01:41:20,417
-She's actually telling the truth.
-Just shut up!

1772
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,417
Kashin, this loser
got drunk and passed out.

1773
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:24,750
I just sent those photos
to make you jealous.

1774
01:41:24,833 --> 01:41:26,667
-Rashi, you're a psycho!
-Who are you?

1775
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:28,375
-I am Sunny.
-Who is Vanessa?

1776
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:29,458
-Vanessa?
-The mistress.

1777
01:41:29,542 --> 01:41:30,792
She sends you those vulgar emails.

1778
01:41:30,875 --> 01:41:32,875
-Bro, she reads all your emails.
-Shut up!

1779
01:41:33,083 --> 01:41:34,667
Get down, dude.

1780
01:41:34,958 --> 01:41:36,750
Rashi, you're so stupid.

1781
01:41:37,333 --> 01:41:38,417
My email got hacked.

1782
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,917
Vanessa is some 60-year-old woman

1783
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,833
who keeps sending me weird emails.

1784
01:41:41,917 --> 01:41:45,083
Baby, I was so insecure.
I love you.

1785
01:41:46,208 --> 01:41:47,583
I will kill you!

1786
01:41:51,083 --> 01:41:52,917
Sorry, sorry!

1787
01:41:58,292 --> 01:42:00,708
Hey, did you show
him the approval letter?

1788
01:42:03,542 --> 01:42:05,792
-Karina?
-Why do you do these things?

1789
01:42:06,375 --> 01:42:08,583
I don't know what happened
to me after reading your emails.

1790
01:42:08,667 --> 01:42:10,042
I thought I lost you.

1791
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:13,750
So why lie to me about your pregnancy?
Bro, she took me to the gynac.

1792
01:42:13,833 --> 01:42:15,125
I've never been there in my life.

1793
01:42:15,208 --> 01:42:16,833
Because you were my plan B.

1794
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,625
But later, even you got
distracted by another girl.

1795
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:22,042
You two didn't even think about me.

1796
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,833
I was so alone.

1797
01:42:28,125 --> 01:42:32,208
You two are so selfish. So selfish!

1798
01:42:32,458 --> 01:42:34,083
You're so selfish!

1799
01:42:34,167 --> 01:42:35,583
Forget me, Sanjay.

1800
01:42:36,167 --> 01:42:40,250
I know it won't be easy.
But, I only love Kashin.

1801
01:42:40,333 --> 01:42:42,083
And everybody just get back to work!

1802
01:42:42,333 --> 01:42:44,583
Hey! First you have
to tell everything to--

1803
01:42:44,667 --> 01:42:45,500
Karina?

1804
01:42:45,583 --> 01:42:46,833
<i>Karina, what happened?</i>

1805
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:47,833
Karina?

1806
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:50,083
Karina!

1807
01:42:50,167 --> 01:42:51,000
Karina!

1808
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:54,167
Karina!

1809
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:58,583
Karina!

1810
01:42:59,458 --> 01:43:00,292
Karina!

1811
01:43:00,375 --> 01:43:01,708
Karina!
Karina!

1812
01:43:01,833 --> 01:43:03,083
You heard everything, didn't you?

1813
01:43:03,208 --> 01:43:04,583
Nothing happened.

1814
01:43:04,667 --> 01:43:07,708
What didn't happened,
could've happened just as easily.

1815
01:43:07,792 --> 01:43:08,875
But listen...

1816
01:43:08,958 --> 01:43:11,042
I swear, I was only there to
collect my cheque.

1817
01:43:11,125 --> 01:43:13,875
Just to collect your cheque?

1818
01:43:14,167 --> 01:43:15,250
What if I say that

1819
01:43:15,417 --> 01:43:18,125
I went over to my boss's
place to get our home loan approved

1820
01:43:18,208 --> 01:43:20,708
I got drunk,
and I don't remember what happened

1821
01:43:20,792 --> 01:43:21,958
will you be okay with that?

1822
01:43:22,083 --> 01:43:25,375
-But nothing like that happened.
-It's all wrong, Sanjay.

1823
01:43:25,542 --> 01:43:26,375
Everything.

1824
01:43:27,667 --> 01:43:30,125
The very foundation of
our relationship is wrong.

1825
01:43:31,292 --> 01:43:34,500
People first fall in love,
then get married and then buy a house.

1826
01:43:35,958 --> 01:43:38,333
-But we began all wrong.
-Karina...

1827
01:43:39,167 --> 01:43:41,083
First the house, then
marriage, and then...

1828
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:44,042
I guess you never loved me.

1829
01:43:44,458 --> 01:43:49,333
-Hey! That's not true, Karina.
-Then what is it?

1830
01:43:50,875 --> 01:43:54,208
You said that you can even
get married for the house.

1831
01:43:54,542 --> 01:43:58,167
-I was just joking.
-You weren't joking.

1832
01:43:58,958 --> 01:44:00,333
I thought it was a joke.

1833
01:44:02,208 --> 01:44:05,375
And that was probably the
only time you were truthful to me.

1834
01:44:06,625 --> 01:44:08,458
You want to hear the truth, Karina?

1835
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:13,292
The truth is you're just
being stubborn right now, okay?

1836
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:17,458
And it was pretty easy
for me to hide all this from you.

1837
01:44:17,625 --> 01:44:19,417
But I decided to tell you the truth.

1838
01:44:21,458 --> 01:44:25,583
Oh wow! What a great guy you are!

1839
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:27,792
Someone give him a Noble Prize.

1840
01:44:27,875 --> 01:44:29,250
No, you listen to me first.

1841
01:44:31,167 --> 01:44:33,292
I didn't make this deal alone, Karina.

1842
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:35,625
You made this deal with me.

1843
01:44:36,625 --> 01:44:39,333
And this 50-50 that you
keep chanting all day

1844
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:42,417
it's not just about cooking
or doing the dishes together.

1845
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,125
It's also got 50-50 trust.

1846
01:44:44,208 --> 01:44:46,167
And currently,
it's zero from your side.

1847
01:44:46,667 --> 01:44:51,250
Yes, my trust in you is zero.

1848
01:44:53,792 --> 01:44:56,375
And let this remain a deal.

1849
01:44:56,875 --> 01:44:59,042
We'll go to the court tomorrow
and get married for our families.

1850
01:44:59,208 --> 01:45:02,875
Take a selfie and sell
this home in a month.

1851
01:45:04,750 --> 01:45:05,750
What do you mean?

1852
01:45:05,917 --> 01:45:09,208
It means, I don't want to have
anything to do with this house.

1853
01:45:09,417 --> 01:45:12,250
This bloody house
now means nothing to me.

1854
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,458
Karina, this house
means everything to me, okay?

1855
01:45:15,958 --> 01:45:17,542
I’ve worked my entire life for it

1856
01:45:17,625 --> 01:45:19,167
and I won't let it go so easily.

1857
01:45:24,875 --> 01:45:26,208
Exactly my point.

1858
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:33,250
It was the house, not love.

1859
01:45:36,125 --> 01:45:37,792
I am selling my house...

1860
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:43,042
if you want it,
then you got to buy it from me.

It's joint ownership,
you must do that.

Wouldn't have been a problem,
if it was single ownership.

No, what if one party
wants to back out

1891
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:44,625
is there a way out?

1892
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:46,583
Back out? What do you mean?

1893
01:47:46,917 --> 01:47:50,125
Listen, bro.
Who is he?

1894
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:52,292
And, you should be
convincing Karina--

1895
01:47:52,375 --> 01:47:54,250
-Sunny, please.
-But--

1896
01:47:55,333 --> 01:47:57,958
Mr. Rehmat, is there a way?

1897
01:47:58,417 --> 01:48:00,958
What's going on? Is this a joke?

1898
01:48:01,125 --> 01:48:02,583
Aren't you two getting
married tomorrow?

1899
01:48:03,042 --> 01:48:03,958
Is there a problem?

1900
01:48:04,167 --> 01:48:09,667
Mr. Rehmat, I just want
to know if there's a way.

1901
01:48:19,375 --> 01:48:20,375
Listen carefully.

1902
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,667
You must get her signature

1903
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:31,625
on a no-objection certificate, for
the property to be single-ownership.

1904
01:48:32,458 --> 01:48:33,833
Then the house is yours.

1905
01:48:34,208 --> 01:48:36,083
-So the NOC--
-What the hell are you--

1906
01:48:36,167 --> 01:48:38,208
Stop interfering.

1907
01:48:38,417 --> 01:48:41,833
What's done is done now.
I can't lose the house.

1908
01:48:42,375 --> 01:48:43,708
Are you going to stoop
so low for a house?

1909
01:48:43,792 --> 01:48:44,708
I don't need your advice!

1910
01:48:46,042 --> 01:48:48,500
I know what I am doing, please.

1911
01:48:48,917 --> 01:48:49,750
Get lost.

1912
01:48:55,333 --> 01:48:56,583
Sorry.

1913
01:48:57,208 --> 01:48:59,583
I'll manage the paperwork

1914
01:48:59,792 --> 01:49:06,167
but you must get her signatures,
and submit it tomorrow.

1915
01:49:06,792 --> 01:49:10,042
Otherwise,
both of you won't get the home.

1916
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:17,000
Sanjay, this is a personal matter.

1917
01:49:18,417 --> 01:49:19,625
Try to solve it gently.

1918
01:49:28,042 --> 01:49:33,750
Mr. Rehmat,
there's no way to solve it gently.

1919
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,583
<i>"It exists in every heart"</i>

1920
01:49:38,667 --> 01:49:45,833
<i>"Even more valuable than</i>
<i>All the riches in the world"</i>

1921
01:49:46,250 --> 01:49:48,833
<i>"Everyone's accepted this slavery"</i>

1922
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,875
<i>"And you should give in too"</i>

1923
01:49:55,333 --> 01:49:56,542
What's going on?

1924
01:49:56,708 --> 01:49:58,333
New couples will
be coming in tomorrow.

1925
01:49:58,500 --> 01:49:59,792
One of the couples
is getting married here.

1926
01:49:59,875 --> 01:50:04,750
<i>"The road of love is very difficult"</i>

1927
01:50:04,833 --> 01:50:10,458
<i>"One who braves the storm,</i>
<i>Finds his shore"</i>

1928
01:50:18,917 --> 01:50:19,833
<i>Mom.</i>

1929
01:50:24,042 --> 01:50:24,875
Come. Come.

1930
01:50:32,625 --> 01:50:34,500
Okay, done.

1931
01:50:35,208 --> 01:50:36,958
Okay.

1932
01:50:38,583 --> 01:50:40,208
Look straight. Look.

1933
01:50:43,333 --> 01:50:45,500
Why are you making me wear all this?

1934
01:50:45,833 --> 01:50:48,042
Because there's a fancy dress
competition in the church.

1935
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:49,625
What do you mean, why?

1936
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,583
It's your wedding day.
What else do you want to wear?

1937
01:50:53,375 --> 01:50:57,167
But it's just a simple signing thing, Mom.

1938
01:50:57,333 --> 01:50:59,583
It's a marriage, Karina girl.

1939
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,167
From today you'll be man and wife.

1940
01:51:05,667 --> 01:51:11,292
You'll get your independence,
your house, your...

1941
01:51:11,583 --> 01:51:14,125
decent man, your way.

1942
01:51:16,208 --> 01:51:19,042
-You don't have to become me.
-Mom, don't--

1943
01:51:19,125 --> 01:51:22,167
No, no, no.
You shouldn't become me.

1944
01:51:26,125 --> 01:51:28,625
I am so proud of you, my girl.

1945
01:51:29,542 --> 01:51:32,083
You know, when I come
to visit you from Canada

1946
01:51:32,208 --> 01:51:34,792
I won't have to stay
in someone else' house.

1947
01:51:36,042 --> 01:51:38,792
I'll stay in my daughter's own house.

1948
01:51:40,167 --> 01:51:41,500
Now, look straight.

1949
01:51:43,292 --> 01:51:44,500
Perfect.

1950
01:51:51,583 --> 01:51:53,167
Mario's blessings.

1951
01:52:16,083 --> 01:52:17,542
Who are you?

1952
01:52:22,333 --> 01:52:23,667
Milkman.

1953
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,083
Tell Karina that the milkman's here.

1954
01:52:26,625 --> 01:52:27,708
I'll call her.

1955
01:52:27,792 --> 01:52:31,000
Mr. Rehmat,
what are you doing here?

1956
01:52:31,208 --> 01:52:34,542
Karina madam, come with
me to the building right now.

1957
01:52:34,625 --> 01:52:35,458
Why?

1958
01:52:35,542 --> 01:52:36,875
Sanjay has messed up everything.

1959
01:52:37,333 --> 01:52:40,292
He's cheating you and me.

1960
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:44,000
He's forged your signatures

1961
01:52:44,083 --> 01:52:46,167
and keeping the apartment for himself.

1962
01:52:46,333 --> 01:52:47,792
What do you mean?

1963
01:52:50,083 --> 01:52:51,000
How do you know?

1964
01:52:51,083 --> 01:52:53,250
Karina madam, stop pretending.

1965
01:52:53,333 --> 01:52:55,458
I know all about your deal.

1966
01:52:55,833 --> 01:52:56,917
Come to the building immediately.

1967
01:52:57,167 --> 01:52:58,292
I've called Sanjay too.

1968
01:52:59,167 --> 01:53:03,583
Mr. Rehmat,
I haven't told anyone about the deal.

1969
01:53:03,667 --> 01:53:05,000
Everyone's sleeping.

1970
01:53:05,083 --> 01:53:07,125
-Nobody should know--
-So wake them up.

1971
01:53:07,208 --> 01:53:08,375
I'll tell Mrs. Blossom.

1972
01:53:08,458 --> 01:53:09,750
I'll tell Mrs. Blossom.

1973
01:53:09,833 --> 01:53:11,375
He's cheating her too.

1974
01:53:11,458 --> 01:53:15,333
I thought this was all about love
and so I helped you two.

1975
01:53:15,417 --> 01:53:16,458
And now I am stuck.

1976
01:53:16,542 --> 01:53:19,250
I signed the documents taking a risk.

1977
01:53:19,333 --> 01:53:21,042
I'll have to shut my shop.

1978
01:53:21,125 --> 01:53:23,125
No, no.
What about my reputation?

1979
01:53:23,208 --> 01:53:25,375
Please speak softly.
Why are you screaming?

1980
01:53:25,458 --> 01:53:26,792
-I am not scared of anyone.
-Hey!

1981
01:53:26,875 --> 01:53:29,125
Are you guys fighting?

1982
01:53:29,208 --> 01:53:30,875
Candice baby, go to sleep. Go.

1983
01:53:30,958 --> 01:53:32,583
Mr. Rehmat,
let's go down and talk.

1984
01:53:32,667 --> 01:53:33,708
No, no, not downstairs.

1985
01:53:33,792 --> 01:53:36,042
I don't want to talk here.

1986
01:53:36,167 --> 01:53:37,292
Come with me to the building.

1987
01:53:37,375 --> 01:53:39,417
I am telling mom.

1988
01:53:39,625 --> 01:53:41,000
Mom!

1989
01:53:41,083 --> 01:53:42,792
Candice, go to sleep. Go.

1990
01:53:42,875 --> 01:53:44,250
I called you a dozen times--

1991
01:53:44,333 --> 01:53:45,875
I understand.

1992
01:53:48,333 --> 01:53:49,958
Candice? Candice!

1993
01:53:52,042 --> 01:53:55,708
If you ring the bell,
you'll wake up your mom.

1994
01:54:06,167 --> 01:54:08,208
You go upstairs while
I go visit the site office.

1995
01:54:08,458 --> 01:54:10,083
You two own the house 50-50.

1996
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:12,000
Don't spare Sanjay so easily, okay?

1997
01:54:16,583 --> 01:54:18,583
-Victor, you saw Karina?
-No, Aunty.

1998
01:54:18,667 --> 01:54:19,958
-Listen!
-One minute.

1999
01:54:20,708 --> 01:54:22,583
-Clarissa, you saw Karina?
-No.

2000
01:54:22,667 --> 01:54:23,500
Listen.

2001
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,875
I told you she ran
away with the milkman.

2002
01:54:28,375 --> 01:54:29,917
I'll slap your face, Candice.

2003
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:31,917
Who taught you that?

2004
01:54:32,625 --> 01:54:35,333
They are from UP,
but they are not milkmen, okay.

2005
01:54:37,833 --> 01:54:40,667
Tell him to stop,
tell him to stop.

2006
01:54:41,167 --> 01:54:45,250
Stop! Stop!

2007
01:54:45,333 --> 01:54:46,708
Where is he? Where is Sanju?

2008
01:54:46,792 --> 01:54:48,250
-Sanju.
-Don't know, uncle.

2009
01:54:48,333 --> 01:54:49,625
I don't see uncle Gajju either.

2010
01:54:49,708 --> 01:54:51,125
They must be quarreling
for the bathroom.

2011
01:54:51,208 --> 01:54:52,042
Go and call them.

2012
01:54:52,125 --> 01:54:53,542
-I'll go.
-No, come here.

2013
01:54:53,708 --> 01:54:55,625
You get inside. Always running around.

2014
01:54:55,875 --> 01:54:56,708
Get in, everyone.

2015
01:54:56,792 --> 01:54:59,250
-But sister, where is Sanju?
-He must be already on the bus.

2016
01:54:59,333 --> 01:55:01,833
Come on.
Stop taking selfies and let's go.

2017
01:55:18,708 --> 01:55:20,750
<i>-Sanju! Sanju!</i>
-Yeah?

2018
01:55:20,875 --> 01:55:21,708
Sanju!

2019
01:55:22,125 --> 01:55:24,625
What are you doing here like this?

2020
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,917
I thought you left with them.

2021
01:55:27,375 --> 01:55:29,542
Left? But where?
Where are you all going?

2022
01:55:29,625 --> 01:55:31,542
To your wedding, of course.
Where else?

2023
01:55:31,625 --> 01:55:34,417
Sister, we got dressed up

2024
01:55:34,542 --> 01:55:36,833
but forgot all about the groom.

2025
01:55:36,917 --> 01:55:38,333
But the registration is at 11:00 a.m.

2026
01:55:38,417 --> 01:55:39,667
Why are you going there so soon?

2027
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:42,750
We've called the registrar
at Jeevan Saathi.

2028
01:55:43,208 --> 01:55:44,458
Your surprise gift.

2029
01:55:44,542 --> 01:55:47,958
Your father was saying,
marriages are never done in courts.

2030
01:55:48,042 --> 01:55:49,875
How can our only son

2031
01:55:49,958 --> 01:55:51,875
get married without
any pomp and grandeur?

2032
01:55:52,875 --> 01:55:54,875
-Mom...
-Go and get ready.

2033
01:55:54,958 --> 01:55:56,375
-Yeah, but--
-The bride's family is coming too.

2034
01:55:56,458 --> 01:55:58,083
-Go on.
-Mom!

2035
01:55:59,750 --> 01:56:02,583
Hey, Sanju.
Where were you?

2036
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:04,458
I thought you're in the bathroom.

2037
01:56:04,625 --> 01:56:05,708
Come on and quickly get ready.

2038
01:56:05,792 --> 01:56:07,083
Wear the turban first.

2039
01:56:07,167 --> 01:56:08,458
Are you sure, Blossom

2040
01:56:08,542 --> 01:56:12,750
-that it was Sanjay fellow she went with?
-Who else will she go with?

2041
01:56:13,208 --> 01:56:15,375
If she reaches the court,
I don't know what we'll do.

2042
01:56:15,458 --> 01:56:18,292
But it was the milkman.

2043
01:56:23,917 --> 01:56:25,250
I am wearing it, uncle.

2044
01:56:25,333 --> 01:56:27,333
-Papa!
-Put on the buttons.

2045
01:56:29,958 --> 01:56:30,917
What are you doing, uncle?

2046
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,750
You need to wear the pyjamas, son.

2047
01:56:32,833 --> 01:56:34,583
Are you expecting me to wear
it while riding a bike?

2048
01:56:34,667 --> 01:56:37,250
-Papa!
-You've grown up in front of me.

2049
01:56:37,417 --> 01:56:38,708
<i>Please, let go of my pants.</i>

2050
01:56:38,792 --> 01:56:40,542
What are you two doing?

2051
01:56:40,625 --> 01:56:42,583
What are you doing?
Why did you stop the bike?

2052
01:56:43,458 --> 01:56:44,333
Uncle!

2053
01:56:44,417 --> 01:56:45,792
-Uncle, what are you doing?
-Return the keys.

2054
01:56:45,875 --> 01:56:48,167
-Not until you wear your pyjamas.
-Uncle!

2055
01:56:48,250 --> 01:56:50,333
Stop acting like a kid.
The bus is leaving! Papa!

2056
01:56:50,417 --> 01:56:51,250
Pyjama.

2057
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:53,333
Here you go.

2058
01:56:53,417 --> 01:56:56,208
Here, wear it quickly.

2059
01:56:56,583 --> 01:57:00,083
-Please sit.
-Now you're looking like a groom.

2060
01:57:00,375 --> 01:57:01,458
No luck yet.

2061
01:57:02,292 --> 01:57:04,667
Where is she? Oh my God, this girl!

2062
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:06,083
She's driving me mad.

2063
01:57:49,708 --> 01:57:54,125
<i>Hi, Karina.</i>
<i>Sorry for calling you here like this.</i>

2064
01:57:54,917 --> 01:57:56,917
<i>I've transferred</i>
<i>this house in your name.</i>

2065
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,583
<i>My NOC is on the table.</i>

2066
01:57:59,792 --> 01:58:02,750
<i>Mr. Rehmat will take care of everything.</i>
<i>Don't worry.</i>

2067
01:58:04,542 --> 01:58:06,917
<i>I'll keep paying my</i>
<i>share of the installments</i>

2068
01:58:07,083 --> 01:58:09,208
<i>until you don't find your 50-50 partner.</i>

2069
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,833
<i>I know you might never forgive me.</i>

2070
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:20,500
<i>But I didn't want your dream to</i>
<i>be shattered because of me.</i>

2071
01:58:20,583 --> 01:58:21,583
<i>So...</i>

2072
01:58:21,667 --> 01:58:25,042
<i>And today is the last day</i>
<i>of possession, so I just thought...</i>

2073
01:58:26,375 --> 01:58:27,875
<i>Karina, I am really sorry.</i>

2074
01:58:30,583 --> 01:58:33,667
<i>And I love you.</i>
<i>I really do.</i>

2075
01:58:36,042 --> 01:58:39,500
<i>I guess it's the first</i>
<i>time I said it to you.</i>

2076
01:58:44,042 --> 01:58:46,917
<i>You must applaud my timing.</i>

2077
01:58:47,708 --> 01:58:50,625
<i>I proposed marriage in the rickshaw.</i>

2078
01:58:50,917 --> 01:58:53,292
<i>And I'm saying</i>
<i>"I love you" through the TV.</i>

2079
01:59:00,583 --> 01:59:02,500
<i>So, it's no more a deal.</i>

2080
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:18,667
Mom?

2081
01:59:18,958 --> 01:59:21,542
<i>-No misbehavior allowed here.</i>
<i>-Everything is allowed.</i>

2082
01:59:21,625 --> 01:59:22,875
It's all allowed.

2083
01:59:23,042 --> 01:59:24,000
Dance!

2084
01:59:28,792 --> 01:59:29,625
It's all allowed.

2085
01:59:29,708 --> 01:59:31,833
Let me go, spare me.

2086
01:59:32,042 --> 01:59:33,417
They've lost their mind.

2087
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:36,292
Blossom, I can't take this anymore.

2088
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:37,750
I think I'm going to faint.

2089
01:59:37,833 --> 01:59:39,917
Nobody is going to faint
at my daughter's wedding.

2090
01:59:40,042 --> 01:59:41,208
Please, Father, look after her.

2091
01:59:41,292 --> 01:59:43,375
I'm just going to take
care of this nonsense just now.

2092
01:59:43,542 --> 01:59:44,708
Mr. Chaturvedi!

2093
01:59:44,792 --> 01:59:46,167
Hello.

2094
01:59:46,583 --> 01:59:48,292
I agreed to this wedding

2095
01:59:48,375 --> 01:59:51,542
because you said,
it will be a simple wedding.

2096
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,125
And look at this. You've the
entire wedding procession.

2097
01:59:54,208 --> 01:59:56,042
It's not the entire procession
We didn't bring the horse.

2098
01:59:56,125 --> 01:59:58,417
We're only dancing for good omen.

2099
01:59:59,125 --> 02:00:01,583
But my people are standing
quietly in a corner.

2100
02:00:01,833 --> 02:00:03,042
What will they think? Please.

2101
02:00:03,125 --> 02:00:04,667
-I mean this is a nuisance.
-Nonsense?

2102
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:07,125
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is really unbelievable.

2103
02:00:07,208 --> 02:00:10,458
She didn't welcome us or follow
any of the rituals or traditions.

2104
02:00:10,542 --> 02:00:12,583
And now she's humiliating
Bramhin Pandits?

2105
02:00:12,667 --> 02:00:14,417
What do you guys want?
Do you want us to leave?

2106
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:15,917
-Is that what you want?
-No, no.

2107
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,208
-No, sister.
-Where are you going?

2108
02:00:18,292 --> 02:00:19,208
Where are you going?

2109
02:00:19,292 --> 02:00:20,458
She's insulting us.

2110
02:00:20,542 --> 02:00:22,625
This isn't Kanpur, try to understand.

2111
02:00:22,792 --> 02:00:24,500
I agreed to this wedding

2112
02:00:24,583 --> 02:00:26,292
because you said,
it will be a simple wedding.

2113
02:00:26,375 --> 02:00:27,875
But this is a simple wedding.

2114
02:00:27,958 --> 02:00:30,250
But you've brought a Pandit as well.

2115
02:00:30,333 --> 02:00:32,333
Are you going to have a
Hindu wedding or what?

2116
02:00:32,417 --> 02:00:33,250
No, no.

2117
02:00:33,333 --> 02:00:34,417
-What will I say to them?
-No, no.

2118
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:36,583
He's our relative.

2119
02:00:37,208 --> 02:00:38,958
-What?
-Relative! Relative!

2120
02:00:40,375 --> 02:00:41,833
But he said he's a Pandit.

2121
02:00:41,917 --> 02:00:44,542
All our friends and
relatives are Pandits.

2122
02:00:44,625 --> 02:00:46,042
You're too much.

2123
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:49,375
<i>Who else did you expect</i>
<i>we'll bring along?</i>

2124
02:00:51,958 --> 02:00:54,125
-Karina!
-Mr. Rehmat, what's going on?

2125
02:00:55,417 --> 02:00:57,333
What happened upstairs
was Sanjay's idea.

2126
02:00:57,583 --> 02:00:58,542
And whatever's going on downstairs

2127
02:00:58,625 --> 02:01:00,167
is your parents' idea.

2128
02:01:00,417 --> 02:01:02,000
I only helped because I
wanted this matter to be resolved.

2129
02:01:02,083 --> 02:01:03,208
Karina, listen to me.

2130
02:01:03,292 --> 02:01:05,208
I agreed to this wedding because--

2131
02:01:05,292 --> 02:01:06,125
Papa, what are you doing?

2132
02:01:06,208 --> 02:01:08,375
-Shut up now.
-There comes that stupid boy.

2133
02:01:09,208 --> 02:01:10,333
Stop this.

2134
02:01:10,625 --> 02:01:11,750
Where is Karina?

2135
02:01:11,833 --> 02:01:13,125
She left with you in the morning,
didn't she?

2136
02:01:13,208 --> 02:01:14,917
Aunty, I'll tell you everything.
First, let me just--

2137
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,208
Candice told me she
ran away with the milkman.

2138
02:01:17,292 --> 02:01:19,792
Look, now she's calling
our son milkman.

2139
02:01:20,958 --> 02:01:23,458
Stop all this!
No one's getting married!

2140
02:01:29,167 --> 02:01:32,250
Sanju, what are you saying
in front of our relatives?

2141
02:01:32,333 --> 02:01:33,750
Mom, I don't care

2142
02:01:33,833 --> 02:01:35,750
what these relatives
or you are going to think.

2143
02:01:35,833 --> 02:01:36,875
Honestly.

2144
02:01:37,542 --> 02:01:41,042
I made this wedding about you
and this house.

2145
02:01:44,583 --> 02:01:47,750
But the one person,
I want to spend my life with

2146
02:01:47,833 --> 02:01:49,208
I couldn't tell
her how much I love her.

2147
02:01:51,583 --> 02:01:52,625
There she is.

2148
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,542
Where were you? Come here, girl!

2149
02:01:57,375 --> 02:01:58,500
Let me explain.

2150
02:01:58,708 --> 02:02:01,250
I'll explain, it's not what you all...

2151
02:02:01,333 --> 02:02:03,167
Karina, I'm so, so, so sorry.

2152
02:02:03,250 --> 02:02:05,708
I had no idea that they were
coming here, like this.

2153
02:02:06,667 --> 02:02:08,917
-Listen, you don't have to marry me.
-Hey!

2154
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,292
Stop provoking her.

2155
02:02:10,375 --> 02:02:12,500
Papa, please be quiet!

2156
02:02:12,583 --> 02:02:14,667
Karina, at least tell
me what's happening?

2157
02:02:14,750 --> 02:02:16,583
Mom, just two minutes.

2158
02:02:17,042 --> 02:02:18,750
Just give me two minutes
with Sanjay, please.

2159
02:02:18,833 --> 02:02:21,042
-Let them talk.
-Your daughter-in-law's really feisty.

2160
02:02:21,125 --> 02:02:22,375
Giving orders even
before they get married.

2161
02:02:22,458 --> 02:02:23,750
Shut up!

2162
02:02:28,375 --> 02:02:30,750
Karina, I would always
look at others' homes.

2163
02:02:31,625 --> 02:02:33,167
I always thought, that...

2164
02:02:33,958 --> 02:02:37,667
when I'll have my own home,
I'll have a flat-screen TV

2165
02:02:37,792 --> 02:02:39,500
and a king-size bed.

2166
02:02:39,917 --> 02:02:42,208
And then I'll be the
happiest person on this earth.

2167
02:02:42,750 --> 02:02:44,792
I did everything
I could for that house.

2168
02:02:45,125 --> 02:02:46,625
I never thought whether
it's right or wrong.

2169
02:02:46,708 --> 02:02:48,083
Never.

2170
02:02:49,250 --> 02:02:51,000
But I was always wrong.

2171
02:02:53,625 --> 02:02:56,042
I wanted a house and not a home.

2172
02:02:57,875 --> 02:03:00,750
And by the time I
realized the difference...

2173
02:03:01,625 --> 02:03:03,250
it was too late.

2174
02:03:04,083 --> 02:03:05,500
Karina, you were right.

2175
02:03:08,167 --> 02:03:10,583
I wish I could fix the
foundation of this relation.

2176
02:03:12,125 --> 02:03:15,042
I want to begin with love,
then marriage

2177
02:03:15,125 --> 02:03:16,375
and then...

2178
02:03:18,542 --> 02:03:21,375
Because there is only one
things that's right in my life, Karina.

2179
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:24,958
And that's you.

2180
02:03:26,583 --> 02:03:29,042
Without you,
this place is not a home.

2181
02:03:29,208 --> 02:03:31,167
It's just a 550 sq. ft. house.

2182
02:03:31,375 --> 02:03:35,583
For which, I couldn't
realize how much I love you.

2183
02:03:39,708 --> 02:03:40,750
You made a mistake, brother-in-law.

2184
02:03:40,833 --> 02:03:42,917
Should've chosen
Mr. Shukla's daughter instead.

2185
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:43,833
Is there a problem?

2186
02:03:43,917 --> 02:03:45,583
-No, no.
-But he doesn't...

2187
02:03:45,667 --> 02:03:47,042
But he didn't agree.

2188
02:03:47,167 --> 02:03:49,125
Okay, so you thought that

2189
02:03:49,208 --> 02:03:51,167
by transferring the house
in my name, and furnishing it

2190
02:03:51,250 --> 02:03:52,500
you will make yourself the hero?

2191
02:03:54,292 --> 02:03:57,625
Will that flat-screen TV and
king-size bed keep me happy?

2192
02:03:57,708 --> 02:03:59,750
No, Karina. No.

2193
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:03,583
I didn't want your dreams
to be shattered because of me.

2194
02:04:03,667 --> 02:04:06,625
Sanjay, this house was my dream.

2195
02:04:09,167 --> 02:04:10,458
But I always dreamt about

2196
02:04:10,625 --> 02:04:13,958
two names on that
nameplate outside the door.

2197
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,333
Two people that stay together

2198
02:04:17,417 --> 02:04:19,417
in good times, and in bad.

2199
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:22,083
In sickness and in health.

2200
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,375
Two people who want
to stay together

2201
02:04:26,458 --> 02:04:28,458
because they love each other.

2202
02:04:29,625 --> 02:04:31,875
That's all I wanted.

2203
02:04:31,958 --> 02:04:33,625
That's all I want too.

2204
02:04:34,042 --> 02:04:35,667
Karina, I love you.

2205
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,500
I really, really do.

2206
02:04:41,208 --> 02:04:43,375
And not for this house,
or anyone else.

2207
02:04:45,333 --> 02:04:49,292
I just want to be your 50-50 partner,
that's it.

2208
02:04:54,417 --> 02:04:57,125
It's a bad omen to wear white.

2209
02:04:57,500 --> 02:04:58,458
What's happening?

2210
02:04:58,542 --> 02:05:00,417
Everything's fine, Blossom.

2211
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:09,417
No, Sanjay. It's not possible now.

2212
02:05:09,667 --> 02:05:12,292
-Karina, please.
-Because...

2213
02:05:13,625 --> 02:05:16,208
you've transferred
the house in my name.

2214
02:05:17,917 --> 02:05:22,458
So if you want to stay with me,
in my house...

2215
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,583
then this can't be a 50-50 deal.

2216
02:05:29,708 --> 02:05:32,625
Now, I'll have 100 percent say...

2217
02:05:34,750 --> 02:05:37,958
and you'll obey 100 percent.

2218
02:05:44,917 --> 02:05:46,542
Like I said...

2219
02:05:46,875 --> 02:05:49,042
I can get married for the house.

2220
02:05:53,542 --> 02:05:55,208
Sister, she's a handful too.

2221
02:05:55,292 --> 02:05:56,583
Brother-in-law, I am leaving.

2222
02:05:56,667 --> 02:05:58,583
Mother's insulting us,
and the daughter's slapping our son.

2223
02:05:58,667 --> 02:05:59,875
I am leaving.

2224
02:06:07,708 --> 02:06:09,333
It's okay.
It's all okay.

2225
02:06:11,875 --> 02:06:13,708
<i>They resemble Lord Shiva</i>
<i>and Goddess Parvati.</i>

2226
02:06:13,792 --> 02:06:14,792
Everything's okay.

2227
02:06:14,875 --> 02:06:18,500
Play! Play!
It's my nephew's wedding.

2228
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,250
<i>-Sanjay!</i>
-Yeah, coming.

2229
02:07:41,625 --> 02:07:44,000
<i>Gattu!</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

2230
02:07:44,083 --> 02:07:45,292
<i>Your father's done.</i>

2231
02:07:45,375 --> 02:07:46,500
<i>The bathroom's vacant now.</i>

2232
02:07:46,583 --> 02:07:47,917
What's the point now?

2233
02:07:48,208 --> 02:07:49,667
There's no pressure anymore.
