00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:46,905
I had a friend,
Friend? He lied to his wife,

381
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,543
that he spent his night with Anthony
Gomsalves,

382
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,712
But actually he saved a girl's life,

383
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,984
They both spend some time together,

384
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:02,686
Girl was feeling uncomfortable so
she turned on the TV.

385
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,355
And then...
There was a hot seen running on TV,

386
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,023
Gire become more uncomfortable.

That night your friend was not with
that girl but that was you,

00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,572
Do you have a parrot?

391
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,818
I can tell you the further story.

392
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:37,816
After started hot scene on TV, you
watch the girl's geography,

393
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,454
and then you forgot your married life
history.

394
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:46,028

Nice place for living.

00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,553
Tell me, why did you call me to send
a courier,

445
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,488
To confirm this thing,

446
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,795
that my husband Gopal were along with
you or not on friday night.

447
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:45,238
Why you are asking me? Ask your
husband, what did he said?

448
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:50,979
That he was with you,
Amazing!

449
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:54,178
Now would you believe on your husband
or a stranger like me,

450
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:59,215
Can we talk in the front on servant?
He is lucky.

451
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:01,148
For whom?
My brother,

452
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:06,728
Look! Anthony Jee,
Gopal and you

Actually...
Actually ekta jee you have an illness,

454
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:13,766
Illness of doubt.

455
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:17,837
If someone praise for your interior
then that's your art work,

456
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:21,468
but if someone praise for your
husband then doubt,

457
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:25,175
If you become lil but late then bad
luck,

458
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,511
but if your husband become late then
doubt,

459
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:32,444
If your husband loves you then
that's your right.

460
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:35,717
But is he said someone to Hello then

461
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,488
doubt!

462
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,090
Doubt!
What the f**k?

463
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:44,331
Doubt has demolished many families,

464
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:50,363
I am sorry but this doubt virues
entered in your all veins.

465
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:54,472
That's why I am saying that doubt,
What the f**k?

466
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:59,104
Oye Anthony you!
My friend.

467
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,718
What was that?
We always meet like this,

468
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:10,985
since school time,
Oh!

469
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,192
How come you are here?

470
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:17,799
Don't ask,
Tell!

471
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:23,171
Forget it, I am shying to telling you

472
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:27,674
Have you done something?
Forget it, it's a family matter.

473
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:32,481
Tell!
Sister in law called me by courier,

474
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:36,708
But her doubt has gone away,
doubt?

475
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:42,723
She wanted to verify that we were
together on that night or not,

476
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:48,125
Don't be angry, leave it,
Actually Gopal.

477
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:49,596
Shut up!

478
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:58,272
Now only I will speak and you will
hear.

479
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:04,912
Three years ago,
I got your company.

480
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,944
I felt in love with you,
but ofcourse.

481
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,314
Love must be happened,

482
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:18,551
because we already gave you heart,
but your madness.

483
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:21,961
Suppose this joly man a hurted man.

484
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:27,094
Thought I did something wrong,

485
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:33,967
On your doubt platform, our
marriage thread,

486
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,241
become like flowers and burry.

487
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,012
What wound you gave this man,

488
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:49,920
don't put salt on my wounds,

489
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:56,395
Friend didn't remain friend.

490
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:01,228
Love didn't remain love,
Enough Gopu!

491
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:04,801
I am sorry! I doubted on you,
Leave me alone.

492
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:16,307
Doubt!
What the f**k?

493
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,284
I am laughing to think about that
courier man,

494
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,354
Don't know where he would be
wandering?

495
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,014

If you will listen then you will be

622
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:28,243
What are you saying,
A man who died,

01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,636

624
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:33,637

628
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:35,233
Vegetables.

629
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,840
Gopal.
What's up?

630
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:45,347
You're being romantic today.

631
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:48,689
I'm being romantic since the
day I saw you.

632
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:51,888
Remember...
our first meeting.

633
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:58,693
You were looking so beautiful...

634
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,231
And our second meeting was in
a TV showroom.

635
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,574
I was there to buy TV.

636
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:12,275
You weren't looking less smart
either.

637
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:15,777
The moment you took off your
glasses.

638
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:18,884
I kept looking at you.

639
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:24,291
After that you also had pink eyes
for four days.

640
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:26,684
You had pink eyes.

641
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:31,564
Remember when I went to Mumbai
and you came after me.

642
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:36,594
And we spent all night on roof
of the bus.

643
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:39,332
We drowned in eachother.

644
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,268
The whole city was drowned that day.

645
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:45,309
It was 26th july.

646
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:48,141
Remember we went to the movies.

647
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:53,044
Baawariya.

648
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,622
And when the hero was standing
at window in a towel.

649
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,221
You're staring at him so much.

650
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:02,420
Ekta...
Again!

651
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:05,132
No one can come between us.

652
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:10,336
That's another thing that your father
has sent us this silent movie.

653
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:15,739
And you family isn't less either
they sent him.

654
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,218
Movie isn't finish yet.

655
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:34,553
Today I'm not here as in-law I'm
here as a brave police officer.

656
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:38,664
And investing the night when you
were missing.

657
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:41,264
Because someone was murdered that
night.

658
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:43,565
The night when I came here.

659
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:47,333
Blue cross street where that
murdered happened.

660
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,544
A dead body was found on that
deadly night.

661
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:53,245
And do you know Mr. Gopal who's
dead body was it?

662
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:58,816
And it isn't another night.

663
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:01,747
It's the night before which you...

664
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:04,982
...threatened Subhod to kill him.

665
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:10,055
Gopal is innocent.

666
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:12,728
And you shouldn't suspect him either.

667
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,309
Gopal was with his friend,
Anthony Gosalves.

668
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:24,873
Where did Anothony come from?

669
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:26,076
In our house.

670
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:28,448
TV without a volume.
Never shuts up.

671
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:31,819
Send Anthony to the police station.

672
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:33,345
For the statement.

673
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:59,640
You lie more than your hieght.

674
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:01,748
But now I have told the truth.

675
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:02,945
But you lied earlier.

676
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,928
And you've been lying, lying and lying.

677
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:25,568
He's not with me.

678
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:39,018
Gopal sent you?

679
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:44,120
Take his statement.

680
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:47,289
And liars will be punished.

681
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:06,714
Boss, I've given the fake statement
but...

682
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:10,949
Because whenever you get out of
one problem another comes along.

683
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,280
Nothing will happen,
Why are you so scared.

684
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:16,818
The way I've handled Ekta.
I'll handle Madhav too.

685
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:42,080
What are you looking at?

686
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:45,878
She's out of your league.

687
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:06,268
Who's she looking at?

688
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:09,776
Cell phones without ring tone
also hit these days.

689
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:12,102
Go...

690
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:30,791
Let's ruin it.
I mean make it.

691
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:43,535
And he's lucky.
He has no sir name.

692
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,986
Why not?
Let me...

693
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:56,286
If Lara Dutta is married to
Brayan Lara...

694
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:57,750
Then what would be her name?

695
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:02,189

696
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:04,231

699
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:23,513

01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,677
He said that he likes sunsets.

701
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:27,148
With his wife.

702
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,150
Lucky.
Why are you quiete?

703
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:53,881

01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:55,081
...saying...

705
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:04,190
...He's a hair stylist that's

706
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:14,927
I was saying that...

707
01:22:06,788 --> 01:22:08,756
Why are you standing there?
Come forward please.

708
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:12,353

I read lips.

709
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:13,656
I'm deaf.

710
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:22,896
Who says that love is blind?

711
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:30,142
Boss, if black returns is made.

01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,740

713
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:00,535
My girl is waiting for me at the

714
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:01,374

715
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,418

726
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:02,635

727
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:07,198
Anthony Gonsalves.

728
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:09,576
What's happening?

729
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:11,042

01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:20,886
Do you know who's he hugging?

732
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:23,350
Must be his wife.

733
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:24,991
She's not his wife.

734
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,424
His wife is Julie.

735
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:28,792
One who came at house the other
day. You weren't home.

736
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:31,025
These are the same shoe's which
you beat me with.

737
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,292
That Anthony came out be a
very loose character.

738
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:38,365
He and Gopla are together.

739
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:39,733
Meaning?

740
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,036
They were both with different girls
that night.

741
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:45,173
He and Julie.

742
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:47,137
And Gopal lied to me.

743
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:49,183
That they were together.

744
01:24:50,518 --> 01:24:52,679
So... how are we going to
confirm that news?

745
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:03,427
Where's Anothony's house?

746
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:04,654
Up there.

747
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:12,634
What kind of women are you?

748
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:15,541
You got so frustrated that you followed
my husband here.

749
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:18,710
We're not like your husband.

750
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:21,675
Your husband is playing.

751
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,239
I'm sure.

752
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:25,410
That both our husbands are cheating
on us.

753
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:28,911
I'm just here to find out that...

754
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:31,247
...what exactly happened that night?

755
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:34,088
One second.
Let me call him out.

756
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,286
Hey Anthony.
Come out.

757
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:44,338
Why are you standing there?

758
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:46,767
Call your sir.
What kind of servent you have?

759
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:47,870
Not servent.

760
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:50,576
He's my husband.

761
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:55,106
You're Anthony?

762
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:59,111
Are you going to tell anyone now?
That you're Anthony.

763
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:16,265
Why are you making your servent
your husband?

764
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:18,534
I swear on Jesus.

765
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:21,637
He's my husband Anthony Gosalves.

766
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:36,917
I'm Anthony Gosalves.
Got beat up when I told the truth.

767
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:38,889
Got beat up here when I lied.

768
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,765
Do whatever you want.

769
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:06,085
If he's Anthony.

770
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:08,719
Then...

771
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:20,129
But Meera likes you only.

772
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:24,362
And now you also have a repectable
job.

773
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:07,304
Why are you so shocked?

774
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,079
Groom is leaving.
Few changes but...

775
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:12,444
Police when instead of Doli.

776
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:14,451
Groom is leaving instead of bride.

777
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:19,051
But what did I do?

778
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:20,628
You didn't do anything.

779
01:28:21,562 --> 01:28:22,460
You're name is Anthony Gonsalves.
Right?

780
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:24,095
Anthony is here.

781
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:27,232
Amar and Akbar will be here too.
We'll watch the movie together.

782
01:28:43,785 --> 01:28:44,149
Why are you crying?

783
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:52,650
First you threatend to kill.

784
01:28:57,265 --> 01:28:58,823
After that...
On the night of murder.

785
01:28:59,334 --> 01:28:59,823
You're missing.

786
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:04,361
After that you showed wrong Anthony
to the right wife.

787
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:09,473
You had wrong Anthony write a
wrong statement.

788
01:29:12,246 --> 01:29:12,974
And you know what's insteresting?

789
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:17,506
This case came to the police office
who's your enemy.

790
01:29:21,656 --> 01:29:25,057
You're going up is confimed.

791
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:29,058
Boss, because of your fun we're
all stuck here.

792
01:29:37,605 --> 01:29:38,333
Truth is...

793
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:41,975
I saved a girl's life that night.

794
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:45,810
And on my friend's yatch.

795
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:48,512
I was with her.

796
01:29:50,618 --> 01:29:52,085
What girl?
Where's the girl?

797
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:55,417
Can be found if looked for.

798
01:30:00,461 --> 01:30:01,758
Give you 15 minutes.
Go find her.

799
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,889
Am I stupid.
Give you time. Scoundrals.

800
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:39,931
Open.

801
01:30:43,204 --> 01:30:43,693
3 days.

802
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:46,971
Wish we were more.
Would've had more days, right?

803
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:47,602
I'm here.

804
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:53,474
If she's not found in 3 days.

805
01:30:57,285 --> 01:30:58,809
That I don't love Esha that much.

806
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:01,179
How much I...

807
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:02,514
...hate you.

808
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:04,783
Wow.

809
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:07,127
3 days.

810
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,073
Madhav has told me everything
on the phone.

811
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:33,977
But why leave the house because
of this?

812
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:41,093
I'm not leaving.
You're leaving.

813
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:44,056
It's not my stuff.

814
01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:45,327
It's your stuff.

815
01:31:47,468 --> 01:31:48,435
Until that girl is found.

816
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,034
You'll sleep outside.

817
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:56,342
I'm your husband.

818
01:31:57,445 --> 01:31:57,843
Remember.

819
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:00,170
Girl in 3 days...

820
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:02,975
or this 3 years of marriage.

821
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:21,968
Good timing.

822
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:23,436
See...

823
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:29,642
In-law lustful and his friend
double lustful.

824
01:32:31,779 --> 01:32:32,871
Need your help.
What's up?

825
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:35,480
I was here with a girl last friday.

826
01:32:36,584 --> 01:32:38,609
I'm looking for her. Can't find her.
Did she come here?

827
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:40,413
No.

828
01:32:41,155 --> 01:32:42,645
But you were here friday night.

829
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:46,786
That's why everything is so messed
up here.

830
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:52,096
Hey listen to this...
Why are you looking away?

831
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,501
Your sister's husband is playing
with other girls.

832
01:32:56,037 --> 01:32:57,299
And I have to involved for nothing.

833
01:32:57,838 --> 01:32:59,271
What's the matter?
What has he done?

834
01:33:05,713 --> 01:33:07,806
Say it. Say it on the face.
Why do you say it behind his back?

835
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:10,946
Nothing, boss.
Phone.

836
01:33:17,491 --> 01:33:18,719
Why did the police arrest you?

837
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:24,824
Did you rape anyone?

838
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:27,194
Meera look...
I'm not stuck alone in this.

839
01:33:27,835 --> 01:33:29,359
Meaning...
Gang rape!

840
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:33,005
Gang rape!
What are you saying?

841
01:33:33,908 --> 01:33:35,102
I swear I'm innocent.

842
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:40,004
It's the first time in my family history
that police...

843
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,010
...came to the house.

844
01:33:42,483 --> 01:33:45,748
Look... you know I never lie.
You know that.

845
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:50,353
Actually my boss is stuck in
a girls situation.

846
01:33:50,825 --> 01:33:52,816
And I'm stuck because I was
getting him out of it.

847
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:56,426
Just once I find that whore.

848
01:33:56,897 --> 01:33:58,091
After that every problem will end.

849
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:02,358
Boss.
You're strange.

850
01:34:02,737 --> 01:34:06,036
Couldn't you ask her for her number,
address or anything that night.

851
01:34:24,392 --> 01:34:25,450
Boss.
That girl will be there too.

852
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:28,151
But it's written here.
Only women no men.

853
01:35:51,345 --> 01:35:53,575
Then are you going to kick
him out?

854
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:01,118
Are you going to kick me out
of the house too?

855
01:36:02,289 --> 01:36:03,586
No...
Why would I kick you out?

856
01:36:09,029 --> 01:36:09,688
Gopal Bhaiya should be ashamed.

857
01:36:10,664 --> 01:36:12,564
I'm feeling ashamed that he's my
brother.

858
01:37:00,614 --> 01:37:00,909
Ekta, your phone fell off.

859
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:09,354
It was Gopal's voice!

860
01:37:11,258 --> 01:37:12,452
Yes.
It was Gopal's voice.

861
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,385
Gopal's voice.

862
01:37:20,968 --> 01:37:22,435
Gopal knows them too.

863
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:28,369
Brother has lost his shame.

864
01:37:29,109 --> 01:37:29,666
He knows them too.

865
01:37:41,322 --> 01:37:41,879
How you're going to do it here?

866
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,714
Will have to go the the ladies
bathroom.

867
01:37:59,173 --> 01:38:00,765
Mine didn't recognize me.
How will your girl recognize you?

868
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:05,773
Hey.
Go to his.

869
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:09,444
You'll get caught if you go in "his".
Go in "her".

870
01:38:45,853 --> 01:38:47,218
Seems like it's going to snow
in the mall.

871
01:38:52,493 --> 01:38:52,891
He's Madhav.

872
01:38:54,128 --> 01:38:54,594
How do you know?

873
01:38:55,396 --> 01:38:56,590
He's done it before.

874
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:27,056
Only one night is left.

875
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:29,453
After that we'll have to do this
all in jail.

876
01:39:30,731 --> 01:39:35,725
It's been two day and we haven't
found whore of yours.

877
01:39:38,305 --> 01:39:39,602
If she's not found.

878
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:42,174
How will this night end?

879
01:39:57,791 --> 01:39:58,348
I'm feeling so bad.

880
01:39:58,892 --> 01:39:59,381
All because of you.

881
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:01,359
Now I'll have to take the credit for
this.

882
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:07,958
Did you find that girl of yours?

883
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:13,435
Shall I go see my girl?

884
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:18,605
I know she's is your sister.

885
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,038
But who would let go of a chance
like this?

886
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:31,717
What happened, Gopal?
You look tensed.

887
01:45:33,894 --> 01:45:35,657
Sobhod Mehra's provident fund
file is ready.

888
01:45:36,596 --> 01:45:36,994
Your sign.

889
01:45:38,065 --> 01:45:39,157
Have it put in my cabin.

890
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:42,334
What do you think?
Who killed him?

891
01:45:44,137 --> 01:45:45,399
He didn't have any enemy.

892
01:45:46,273 --> 01:45:46,796
Except you.

893
01:45:49,042 --> 01:45:49,838
Didn't you?

894
01:45:51,378 --> 01:45:54,279
You're the only one who used to
always fight with him.

895
01:45:57,150 --> 01:45:57,946
I'm justjoking, Gopal.

896
01:45:58,985 --> 01:45:59,849
Send me the file.

897
01:46:12,899 --> 01:46:13,297
Is Laxman here?

898
01:46:28,415 --> 01:46:32,545
Now start typing my promotion letter
with my appointment letter.

899
01:46:33,186 --> 01:46:33,515
What for?

900
01:46:36,256 --> 01:46:39,157
The girl you had fun with
all night long.

901
01:46:40,026 --> 01:46:40,720
She's sitting in front of me.

902
01:46:41,762 --> 01:46:42,421
I'm speaking from her place.

903
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:44,155
Where did you find that girl?

904
01:46:45,298 --> 01:46:47,163
Enough questions.
Write down the address.

905
01:47:14,127 --> 01:47:14,616
She's not that girl.

906
01:47:22,569 --> 01:47:23,661
What are you talking about?

907
01:47:28,074 --> 01:47:28,403
Look at me.

908
01:47:29,509 --> 01:47:33,502
Remember when we came on
the road.

909
01:47:34,881 --> 01:47:38,112
Some thugs came at me.

910
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:39,945
And then you...

911
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:41,609
and after that...

912
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:48,955
we went on the yatch.

913
01:48:05,011 --> 01:48:06,603
Have you had plastic surgery?

914
01:48:11,718 --> 01:48:12,309
Story is correct.

915
01:48:13,687 --> 01:48:14,381
But cast is wrong.

916
01:48:18,959 --> 01:48:20,290
He still hasn't forgotten her face.

917
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:23,595
She must be unforgetable.

918
01:48:26,266 --> 01:48:28,461
She's not that girl.
Only you know that.

919
01:48:29,402 --> 01:48:30,164
Madhav doesn't know that.

920
01:48:31,238 --> 01:48:32,136
She's give that statement.

921
01:48:33,173 --> 01:48:34,105
Madhav's problem.

922
01:48:37,744 --> 01:48:39,075
Night on the yatch story.

923
01:48:47,687 --> 01:48:48,881
Boss, if I can become Anthony then...

924
01:48:50,023 --> 01:48:51,650
...why can't munni become that girl?

925
01:48:52,792 --> 01:48:54,384
You just need to give her 3 lacs.

926
01:48:58,832 --> 01:49:00,265
You said 2 lacs earliar.

927
01:49:01,167 --> 01:49:02,395
1 lac for my get up!

928
01:49:04,804 --> 01:49:05,930
I was going for 2 lacs but...

929
01:49:06,706 --> 01:49:07,934
He said that we should tell you
3 lacs.

930
01:49:08,909 --> 01:49:10,001
And distribute 1 in ourselves.

931
01:49:15,782 --> 01:49:18,683
You keep the whole 1 lac.
I don't want to be part of this.

932
01:49:19,953 --> 01:49:21,011
He said that, boss.

933
01:50:01,628 --> 01:50:02,287
Tell me how am I looking?

934
01:50:03,029 --> 01:50:03,552
Bomb.

935
01:50:08,101 --> 01:50:09,159
How are you my baawariya?

936
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:11,032
I'm going cold without you.

937
01:50:11,871 --> 01:50:12,701
Then hear this warm news.

938
01:50:15,308 --> 01:50:16,206
Money has been arranged.

939
01:50:16,676 --> 01:50:17,301
What are you saying!?

940
01:50:19,379 --> 01:50:21,347
Money has been arranged.
That's what I'm saying.

941
01:50:23,216 --> 01:50:26,014
You'll be free and then...

942
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:00,884
How relax you guys are.

943
01:51:01,821 --> 01:51:03,686
Resting, eating apples.

944
01:51:06,326 --> 01:51:07,850
Your movie climax has come.

945
01:51:09,262 --> 01:51:11,127
Movie isn't finshed yet.

946
01:51:11,698 --> 01:51:13,325
Does your movie starts
after the climax?

947
01:51:14,868 --> 01:51:15,857
I found the girl.

948
01:51:38,224 --> 01:51:39,748
I'm not saying that...
Munni is saying that.

949
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:44,863
Did I say anything?
No.

950
01:51:48,601 --> 01:51:49,568
Did I say anything?
No.

951
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:52,097
You did so many frauds in the
company.

952
01:51:52,572 --> 01:51:54,096
Did I say anything?
No.

953
01:51:55,208 --> 01:51:56,800
After killing Sobhod Mehra...

954
01:52:00,046 --> 01:52:02,446
You want me to become a false
witness.

955
01:52:04,317 --> 01:52:05,079
That I was with you that night.

956
01:52:10,023 --> 01:52:11,490
And I'm leaving this city.

957
01:52:21,434 --> 01:52:22,423
I'm here brother.

958
01:52:22,769 --> 01:52:23,758
But no one would let go of a
chance like that.

959
01:52:33,246 --> 01:52:33,905
I didn't do anything.

960
01:52:35,315 --> 01:52:37,875
I'm sure that Sobhod Mehra's killer
has kidnaped Munni.

961
01:52:38,651 --> 01:52:39,083
To set me up.

962
01:52:40,086 --> 01:52:42,884
Say thank you to that killer
for me.

963
01:52:48,094 --> 01:52:49,925
Indian woman is after all
indian woman.

964
01:52:50,864 --> 01:52:51,694
Fight aside.

965
01:52:52,198 --> 01:52:52,960
Husband first.

966
01:52:53,767 --> 01:52:56,099
She's brought a lawer with her
to bail me out.

967
01:52:57,036 --> 01:52:57,695
Why are you bailing him out?

968
01:53:02,709 --> 01:53:04,802
He's not a crimnal lawyer.
He's a divorce lawyer.

969
01:53:06,479 --> 01:53:07,138
Now you need to dicide.

970
01:53:08,248 --> 01:53:08,873
That you want this mutualy or...

971
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:10,143
...in court.

972
01:53:12,519 --> 01:53:13,986
Divorce case with crimnal case.

973
01:53:14,587 --> 01:53:15,747
Buy one get one free.

974
01:53:18,358 --> 01:53:20,758
I swear I didn't murder anyone.

975
01:53:26,266 --> 01:53:27,324
You're feeling very Ionely, right?

976
01:53:28,234 --> 01:53:33,069
I'll go and get both of your
friends over here.

977
01:54:01,935 --> 01:54:04,199
I'm talking about you.
C company D company

978
01:54:04,604 --> 01:54:05,468
What company is it?

979
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:07,738
What racket are you running?

980
01:54:09,442 --> 01:54:11,171
Meera I've never even touched
a tennis racket.

981
01:54:11,744 --> 01:54:13,405
I'm telling the truth.
Say something.

982
01:54:16,649 --> 01:54:17,673
Forget it.
Let me explain.

983
01:54:19,986 --> 01:54:21,317
Need to tell you the truth.

984
01:54:23,056 --> 01:54:26,423
Actualy it's all because of my
boss and his sister's husband.

985
01:54:29,562 --> 01:54:32,360
Police suspects that my boss has
killed some one last friday.

986
01:54:33,299 --> 01:54:36,268
And boss says that he was at
the disco that night.

987
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:40,328
When he was leaving, some thugs were
after a girl at blue cross street.

988
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:43,135
And then he saved that girl.

989
01:54:44,577 --> 01:54:47,045
He took care of that scared girl.

990
01:54:47,413 --> 01:54:49,540
After that they both went on the
yatch at Malegaon Beach.

991
01:54:50,783 --> 01:54:52,648
Yes but...
how do you know all this?

992
01:54:53,786 --> 01:54:54,343
Did they make a film about it?

993
01:54:55,388 --> 01:54:56,412
I'm that girl.

994
01:55:38,064 --> 01:55:38,587
Tell me it's a lie.

995
01:55:42,068 --> 01:55:42,432
It's the truth.

996
01:55:55,648 --> 01:55:56,672
You should be happy.

997
01:55:59,752 --> 01:56:02,346
The girl your looking for is
standing in front of you.

998
01:56:11,798 --> 01:56:12,787
You and Gopal.

999
01:56:13,833 --> 01:56:15,027
That night...
On the yatch.

1000
01:56:28,448 --> 01:56:31,212
A man and a women spends a night
together at a place...

1001
01:56:31,851 --> 01:56:33,011
...that doesn't mean there's something
between them...

1002
01:56:35,521 --> 01:56:37,011
You're suspecting me!

1003
01:56:41,594 --> 01:56:43,084
I'm going to the police station
to give my statement.

1004
01:56:45,031 --> 01:56:45,554
And one more thing...

1005
01:56:48,968 --> 01:56:51,368
If you love then learn also to trust.

1006
01:56:53,306 --> 01:56:56,400
If you don't trust me that you
dont need to marry me.

1007
01:56:57,076 --> 01:57:00,534
I don't want us be like Gopal and
his wife.

1008
01:57:17,697 --> 01:57:18,629
I made a mistake, Meera...

1009
01:57:19,499 --> 01:57:21,126
I will never suspect you again.

1010
01:57:26,339 --> 01:57:26,896
Please put this on.

1011
01:57:31,244 --> 01:57:31,642
Who gave you this one?

1012
01:57:35,581 --> 01:57:36,070
Let's go to the police station.

1013
01:57:37,417 --> 01:57:37,906
Why are you laughing?

1014
01:58:05,411 --> 01:58:07,106
Where's is my Munni?
Have you lost your daughter?

1015
01:58:07,647 --> 01:58:09,274
Not daughter.
My big Munni.

1016
01:58:10,183 --> 01:58:10,842
Vasooli's Munni.

1017
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:16,847
Look! We don't know about Munni,

1018
01:58:17,023 --> 01:58:21,824
You gave me your mobile number when
I will find her I'll give you miss call.

1019
01:58:22,462 --> 01:58:26,262
Since mu munni came to your netwrok
she is out of reach.

1020
01:58:26,566 --> 01:58:27,999
Who is this?

1021
01:58:29,135 --> 01:58:32,764
Look! She is not munni, what are you
doing, you can't do this,

1022
01:58:32,905 --> 01:58:36,432
You can't take law in your hands,
So her name is law,

1023
01:58:36,742 --> 01:58:40,143
Now watch Wasuli's law, send my munni
and take your law,

1024
01:58:42,148 --> 01:58:45,379
I have a gun and I will kill you,

1025
01:58:46,986 --> 01:58:51,685
My mobile number is 90022001.

1026
01:58:57,396 --> 01:59:01,127
I've already said,
Inspector!

1027
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:07,102
I'll shoot you,
I found that girl.

1028
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:09,674
Who girl?
Meera!

1029
01:59:09,876 --> 01:59:13,004
Who Meera,
Who were along with Gopal that night,

1030
01:59:15,548 --> 01:59:17,948
Her name is Munni!
No! That was our setting.

1031
01:59:18,084 --> 01:59:21,611
Then whose setting is with Meera,
She is my personal setting,

1032
01:59:21,954 --> 01:59:25,412
Send meera, send meera,
Wasuli took the meera,

1033
01:59:25,892 --> 01:59:28,224
Now who is Wasuli?
He is munni's boy friend,

1034
01:59:29,328 --> 01:59:32,923
If he is a boyfriend of Munni so he
should take munni why meera,

1035
01:59:33,065 --> 01:59:34,657
because he needs munni,

1036
01:59:40,173 --> 01:59:43,074
It's enough!
Baby! Not now.

1037
01:59:43,743 --> 01:59:45,734
Would you put my entire family in
prison,

1038
01:59:45,912 --> 01:59:49,473
I want to put them in mental hospital
but I just have jail,

1039
01:59:49,649 --> 01:59:51,674
Why you are voicing getting echo,

1040
01:59:52,518 --> 01:59:54,509
Gopal is my brother,
So sad,

1041
01:59:54,754 --> 01:59:58,520
And he is in tension, and besides you
help him,

1042
01:59:58,824 --> 02:00:00,849
you're always after him,
I am sorry,

1043
02:00:01,427 --> 02:00:06,023
Take out Gopal Bhaiya,
He is already out,

1044
02:00:06,332 --> 02:00:09,062
MD Sawant bailed for him and took
him out,

1045
02:00:09,769 --> 02:00:11,669
then we should go there,
Why?

1046
02:00:11,871 --> 02:00:14,897
Because when boss exit from one
problem then he enters another

1047
02:00:18,277 --> 02:00:20,871
Thanks for the bail sir,
Anytime Gopal.

1048
02:00:22,181 --> 02:00:24,945
But where we are going?
Lovers point,

1049
02:00:41,067 --> 02:00:45,436
He is boss and big boss,
but why they are going to lovers point

1050
02:00:48,674 --> 02:00:52,633
Ekta bhabhi always thought that boss
has an affair with girls,

1051
02:00:57,483 --> 02:00:59,849
Bhabhi! Come quickly to lovers point.

1052
02:01:00,119 --> 02:01:02,849
You don't know what bhaiyya did,
Hello! Wasuli Bhai.

1053
02:01:03,055 --> 02:01:07,082
You bring meera to lovers point,
Whom you wants to talk,

1054
02:01:29,148 --> 02:01:30,513
Sir why you took me here,

1055
02:01:31,217 --> 02:01:34,209
Before knowing the reason to come
here, I want to show you something,

1056
02:01:59,111 --> 02:02:01,773
It's for you,
read it,

1057
02:02:07,053 --> 02:02:11,786
Me Gopal admits in my senses that
I have

1058
02:02:15,294 --> 02:02:17,489
I have killed Subut Mehra,
Subut Mehra.

1059
02:02:20,199 --> 02:02:23,100
Because he knew that I smuggle drugs

1060
02:02:23,669 --> 02:02:28,003
but now I realize my mistake and
that's why

1061
02:02:28,674 --> 02:02:30,369
I am committing suicide,
Suicide?

1062
02:02:31,677 --> 02:02:34,703
You committing suicide gopal,
I didn't wrote this letter,

1063
02:02:35,047 --> 02:02:36,776
but hand writing is yours,

1064
02:02:38,584 --> 02:02:42,486
hand writing is mine but I didn't
wrote it,

1065
02:02:44,023 --> 02:02:46,184
But how would you prove this thing
after death,

1066
02:02:50,629 --> 02:02:53,564
Subut Mehra find out that Sawant
smuggles drugs,

1067
02:03:28,134 --> 02:03:30,796
that's why I export him up,

1068
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:35,263
You were the murder suspect that's
why to change it to truth

1069
02:03:36,475 --> 02:03:39,842
I diappeared Munni and plan this
letter.

1070
02:03:45,084 --> 02:03:47,917
I knew that drugs smuggles in golden
fishery.

1071
02:03:48,654 --> 02:03:52,556
That's fine, it means Brother is
innocent, Shit man.

1072
02:03:56,762 --> 02:04:00,163
Munni! My meera's passport, her
Wasuli is also coming,

1073
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:01,864
Hanger of death.

1074
02:04:09,675 --> 02:04:11,643
Even you can open it,

1075
02:04:15,047 --> 02:04:17,641
Come on, rather Brother will be hang
on death,

1076
02:04:20,219 --> 02:04:21,277
but the problem is,

1077
02:04:22,087 --> 02:04:25,454
I wasted my bullets on them, so I
have a gun but not bullets,

1078
02:05:13,072 --> 02:05:17,133
Leave my husband, however he is but
he is my husband,

1079
02:05:20,479 --> 02:05:23,175
It's good that you came here,

1080
02:05:23,782 --> 02:05:26,444
Where I didn't find you,
I am here my Saawariya.

1081
02:05:26,652 --> 02:05:31,749
I am the girl who spent a night with
gopal, and I like him,

1082
02:05:33,826 --> 02:05:34,918
Not you,

1083
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:40,359
Ekta she is girl with whom I spent a
night,

1084
02:05:42,501 --> 02:05:45,993
Yes! Inspector I am the girl with
who spent a night with him,

1085
02:05:50,609 --> 02:05:52,873
He is your brother, Flirt,

1086
02:05:54,446 --> 02:05:59,145
Why I didn't die to hear it and if I
didn't die then now I will die,

1087
02:06:00,886 --> 02:06:01,818
Ekta!

1088
02:06:03,589 --> 02:06:06,649
This hanger is not for you, give me
your hand and come down,

1089
02:06:06,926 --> 02:06:09,918
What are you doing? Have you gone mad
Save my bhabhi.

1090
02:06:10,362 --> 02:06:13,695
Why? She is losing her life,
I already told her to leave gopal,

1091
02:06:14,266 --> 02:06:16,166
But she never listen to me,
Silly girl.

1092
02:06:17,503 --> 02:06:21,064
Send Gopal up,

1093
02:06:23,075 --> 02:06:26,067
One was a rental,
And another girl?

1094
02:06:30,516 --> 02:06:33,349
I was with another girl but,
You don't have any answer,

1095
02:06:42,795 --> 02:06:46,458
Wow Boss Wow,
Bad butterfly.

1096
02:06:48,067 --> 02:06:49,898
Gopal was also with meera,

1097
02:06:55,341 --> 02:06:59,607
Finally you said truth,
What rubbish, I ain't do nothing,

1098
02:06:59,778 --> 02:07:03,771
then whenever I asked you from that
night then why do you laugh?

1099
02:07:07,052 --> 02:07:10,112

1100
02:07:14,793 --> 02:07:17,660
Bhabhi! You come down, I'll hang

My son! Come down I am the boss of
your boss, let me hang gopal,

1102
02:07:27,973 --> 02:07:30,498
Get away to hell with boss,

1103
02:07:39,785 --> 02:07:43,881
I should have to die that I love a
guy like you,

1104
02:07:44,089 --> 02:07:47,081
I conveyance you a lot but you always
doubt on me,

1105
02:07:51,363 --> 02:07:54,526
One minute! Tell the truth before
death,

1106
02:07:56,068 --> 02:08:02,166
Ekta! I swear nothing happened with
me and Gopal that night,

1107
02:08:02,608 --> 02:08:04,701
See!
Your husband is innocent,

1108
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:12,378
But what happend with that witch,
I don't know about that,

1109
02:08:19,058 --> 02:08:21,788
Recovery is close from today,

1110
02:08:22,294 --> 02:08:25,889
I understand, this swine didn't
left your munni,

1111
02:08:30,469 --> 02:08:33,461
I can only request you,

1112
02:08:39,945 --> 02:08:44,609
I loved you to suppose innocent and
you betray me to suppose poor,

1113
02:08:49,054 --> 02:08:52,820
I will die, fow whom I did all

02:08:52,925 --> 02:08:56,725
that wasuli doubts on me,
I hate you,

1115
02:08:57,696 --> 02:09:01,257
But before death I want to clearify
something.

1116
02:09:03,102 --> 02:09:06,833
I don't have an affair with your
brother,

1117
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:11,171
and to do all this this brother pay
to me,

I was always innocent but not anymore,

1119
02:09:31,363 --> 02:09:34,730
You idiots, don't move.

1120
02:09:35,033 --> 02:09:37,866
Police has surrounded this place from
one corner,

1121
02:09:39,138 --> 02:09:43,268
I have a gun and I will shoot you,
This is cheating,

1122
02:09:43,842 --> 02:09:45,810
You said you don't have bullets,

1123
02:09:50,015 --> 02:09:51,983
What was the need to tell them,

1124
02:09:52,251 --> 02:09:55,948
You are such an punk and I am a
bigger punk than you that I loved you

1125
02:09:59,491 --> 02:10:01,425
Where are you going?

1126
02:10:08,333 --> 02:10:10,927
You make my sister cry,
Bullet is not inside that gun,

1127
02:10:18,177 --> 02:10:20,270
Someone tell me what's going on,

1128
02:10:21,613 --> 02:10:26,880
What's going on, I told you to bring
some people here,

1129
02:10:29,621 --> 02:10:34,490
Now I have been decided, only man
will die and that's me,

1130
02:10:34,726 --> 02:10:38,560
I will help you,
I want peace,

1131
02:10:48,373 --> 02:10:51,604
Now why are you angry?
Gopal is innocent, Madhav,

1132
02:10:52,911 --> 02:10:57,143
I am a serial watcher but my husband
is not a serial killer,

1133
02:10:58,350 --> 02:11:01,786
Boss! You forgot your anger, if police
officer will come in your family then

1134
02:11:01,954 --> 02:11:03,581
can face many problems like that.

1135
02:11:04,523 --> 02:11:07,959
Come on shake your brother with
brother, then you'll get my hand.

1136
02:11:25,477 --> 02:11:27,968
Sorry! Ekta, I lied to you.

1137
02:11:28,680 --> 02:11:31,046
You lied to me because I always
doubt on you.

1138
02:11:32,084 --> 02:11:36,282
Gopal! I promise I will never see
these serials again.

1139
02:11:38,724 --> 02:11:43,024
This serials are always contageous,
You know what happend to the serial

02:14:26,058 --> 02:14:32,395
