1
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,725
I never imagined you would come.

2
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,658
How did you manage? - Don't ask.

3
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,529
I made an excuse that it's
a college educational tour.

4
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,125
Yet, dad was reluctant.

5
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,703
But somehow I managed
to convince him.

6
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,602
Trust me. It's a really nice place.

7
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,539
Really? - Yeah.

8
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,279
Wow! It's beautiful.

9
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,408
Now do you see"

10
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,078
...why I was saying
no for Lonavla and Khandala?

11
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,751
Whose property is this?

12
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,350
Nikhil. - Who?

13
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,017
Saby's friend Nikhil.

14
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,691
It's his uncle's property.

15
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,128
They come here sometimes on a holiday.

16
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,562
The entire property?

17
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,092
No. Only up till here.

18
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,727
The property on the
other side of the fence..

19
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:04,970
"Belongs to someone else.

20
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,538
Some Casablanca.

21
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,738
By the way not a bad choice.

22
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,645
Sometimes dad's expectations scare me.

23
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,712
You know.

24
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,356
He was the best
footballer of his time.

25
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,251
He was the striker for Churchill Club.

26
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,222
But..

27
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,465
When his dad passed away"

28
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,298
The family responsibility.

29
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,064
He had to leave everything.

30
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,404
...and take up a job in a bank.

31
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,072
But you should see
the glow on his face"

32
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,617
...when he sees me play.

33
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,587
Do you know,
I can do anything for papa.

34
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,350
I just want to see him happy.

35
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,085
I owe him that much.

36
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,555
If he hadn't adopted me..

37
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,031
I don't know where I would be.

38
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,665
Can I ask you something?

39
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,438
Just promise me you won't say no.

40
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:19,510
What?

41
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,610
Will you please swim
with me in that lake?

42
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:31,220
I can't believe I lied at home,
put up a scene"

43
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,258
...to come with a duffer like you.

44
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,039
I am done.

45
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,704
I'm super tired.

46
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,709
Come on. Don't be a spoil-span.

47
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,477
I'll see you inside, okay.

48
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,179
Come on.

49
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,545
Come back.

50
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,317
Come fast.

51
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,220
You will miss me.

52
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,524
Let us pray. Lord Jesus Christ.

53
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,216
The three days you laid in the tomb.

54
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,553
You made holy the graves
of all those who believed in you.

55
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,565
And even though their
bodies lay in the earth..

56
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,698
...they trust that they,
like you will rise again.

57
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,169
Given our sister Pearl
rests in this grave.

58
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:06,509
Until that you,
the resurrection and the life..

59
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,147
...will raise her up in glory.

60
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,345
There she may be in the light
of your presence, Lord Jesus.

61
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,178
And the kingdom where
you live forever and ever.

62
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:19,658
Amen.

63
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,245
Since Almighty God
called our sister Pearl..

64
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,413
...from this life to himself.

65
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,456
We commit her body to the
earth from which it was made.

66
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:56,123
Christ was the first
to rise from the dead.

67
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:59,028
And we know that He will
raise up our mortal bodies"

68
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,362
...to be like his in glory.

69
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,501
We commend our sister
Pearl to the Lord.

70
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,697
May the Lord receive
her into His peace"

71
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:12,238
...and raise up her body
from the last day.

72
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,466
Wouldn't this Christmas
tree look better..

73
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,005
...If we put up lights?

74
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,546
Yes, Prakash.
- Hi, John. How's it going?

75
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,104
Good. How are you?

76
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,614
As usual, cooking.

77
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,584
Cooking up stories. - Good morning.

78
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,745
I called to remind you..
- Hi, Prakash.

79
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,786
Remember about this evening? - What?

80
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,025
What about this evening?

81
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,118
It's my wedding anniversary,
you forgot again.

82
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,222
No, no, no..

83
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,096
I remember. I do.

84
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,358
I can tell that you do.

85
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,266
Look, John. No ditching this time.

86
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,701
You and Maria have to come.
- Yeah, we will try.

87
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,442
There's no trying.

88
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,545
Come on.

89
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,603
We haven't met for so long.

90
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,114
You guys are coming, sharp 8 o'clock.

91
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,174
That's it.

92
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,353
Prakash.

93
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,424
Some relations are so strange.

94
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,026
Can't believe they have survived
25 years with all their fights

95
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,758
Today's their anniversary.

96
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,628
They've invited us.

97
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,407
Maria, I think we should go.

98
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,669
I think we should go.

99
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,182
I really think we should go.

100
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,424
Maria.

101
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,333
Maria, please.
Don't do this to yourself.

102
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,398
It's been two years,
you haven't stepped out of home.

103
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,804
You never meet anyone.

104
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,070
Come on, let's go over to Prakash's.

105
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,113
Maybe you will feel better.

106
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,274
I had a dream last night.

107
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,217
The same one again.

108
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,750
It was my fault.

109
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,545
It was my fault. - Come on.

110
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,420
I shouldn't have let her go.
- Come on.

111
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,151
I am so sorry.

112
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,985
I am so sorry.

113
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:21,199
How long are you going
to torture yourself like this?

114
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,069
It was not your fault.

115
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,728
It was not your fault.

116
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,497
It was God's will.

117
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:33,168
She's gone. But we're alive.

118
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,571
We should be grateful.

119
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,344
We're alive.
We should have faith in God.

120
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,213
Have faith in God and then
He treats you like sh*t. - No.

121
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:44,189
No, don't say that.

122
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,064
Listen, I've to go.

123
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,534
I'll be back by 6:30.

124
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,363
7 o'clock.

125
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,605
7 o'clock. We're leaving.

126
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,342
We're going that's final.

127
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,545
Put on a nice dress, okay.

128
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,738
Red colour or something.

129
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,717
Bye. Love you.

130
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,475
Good morning, ma'am.

131
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,451
Courier for Mr. John Day.

132
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,025
Thank you.

133
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,461
Excuse me, madam.

134
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,564
Can I get a glass of drinking water, please?

135
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,633
Sure.

136
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,136
Mr. Ghosh, I am really sorry.

137
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,107
This is not possible.

138
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,371
Sir, everything's possible.

139
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,640
The market takes 2%, you can take 4%.

140
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:17,710
Mr. Ghosh!

141
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,276
You're an old customer of our bank.

142
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,980
You shouldn't be saying things like this.

143
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,022
Look, everything lies in your hands.

144
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,759
You can benefit from this too"
- Please leave.

145
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,526
Otherwise I will have to call the police.

146
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,426
And I don't want to do that.

147
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,698
And next time don't come to me..

148
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,531
...with such fraudulent,
disgusting proposals.

149
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,660
Yeah, Maria.
- Your wife's been tied on your bed.

150
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,220
She's in my captive.

151
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:07,496
What?

152
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,032
Who the hell are you?

153
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,003
Who is speaking? - Osama Bin Laden.

154
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,235
Did that make a difference?

155
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,472
What do you want?

156
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,080
Cooperation.

157
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:25,980
Listen.

158
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,981
My accomplice will come see you. Sandy.

159
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,319
He'll tell you what you need to do.

160
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,251
Hello. Hello.

161
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,450
Hello.

162
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,028
I want to talk to Maria, please.

163
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,109
Good afternoon, sir.

164
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,118
Hand me the JK Enterprises file.

165
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,723
Here, sir. - Thanks.

166
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,335
I think its me you are waiting for.

167
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,029
I am Sandy.

168
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,653
It's time for you to make the call.

169
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,572
Yes, you can all leave.

170
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,444
I'm busy with something. I'll lock up.

171
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,144
Mr. John Day. Shall we begin?

172
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,214
I'll have to do it, madam.

173
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,253
What to do?

174
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,560
You've seen my face.

175
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,687
How are you, ACP sir?

176
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,061
Why haven't you done Khan sir's job yet?

177
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,524
Look, sir.

178
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,101
You know... new mayor.

179
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,070
New members of the urban commission.

180
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,634
New risk.

181
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,069
So I want new payment as well.

182
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,342
I've a simple code.

183
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,275
Take bribe honestly.

184
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,677
And do your job honestly.

185
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:02,552
Anyway Khan sir isn't paying
from his own pocket.

186
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,591
Al hunain are very rich.

187
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,599
Don't feel bad.

188
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,732
I am a big man, with big hunger..

189
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,135
...and a bigger stomach.

190
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:19,110
Take my advice,
and grow your hunger as well.

191
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,315
You've a valid point.

192
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,281
How about some 'Biryani'?

193
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,062
What are you doing?

194
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,464
Aren't you eating? - I'm fasting today.

195
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,635
It's Thursday.

196
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,737
You're 50..

197
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,741
No, I..

198
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,522
Enough. I am full.

199
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,389
My stomach's full.

200
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:21,535
Sir. Did the 'Biryani'
make you change your mind?

201
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,070
Go on, eat it.

202
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,670
This is for you.

203
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,136
No, sir.

204
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,143
My stomach's full.

205
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,144
So soon?

206
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:31,011
Yes.

207
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:37,450
You just said "Big man,
with a big stomach, bigger hunger".

208
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,388
This is for me. - Only for you.

209
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,456
Just two spoons. That's it.

210
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,298
Enough.

211
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:57,308
Last two. - No, sir. I'm full.

212
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,167
Rascal.

213
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:03,237
I said...two more spoons.

214
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,726
Come on, finish it.

215
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,290
I'm not supposed to eat oily food.

216
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:50,190
Come on.

217
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,759
Let's have sweets. Of your choice.

218
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:00,369
Eat it.

219
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:02,963
Eat it..

220
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,703
Look, Gautam"

221
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:23,993
More!

222
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:46,045
Water! Water!

223
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,728
Restrict yourself
to lentil and rice, Wagle.

224
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,404
'Biryani' doesn't suit you.

225
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,755
Situated in Mumbai city's Chembur area..

226
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,286
...Royal Citizen Cooperative Bank
was robbed last night.

227
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,759
No one knows how and when
the robbery was committed.

228
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,654
According to sources,
when the security personnel's..

229
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:31,992
...opened the bank in the morning..

230
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,087
"They found the bank manager..

231
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,529
...and the guard injured.

232
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,033
The police are conducting
their investigation.

233
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,035
"But they haven't found a clue yet.

234
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,572
It's clear that,
the hoodlums in the city..

235
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:44,098
...managed to give the police
and the administration the slip.

236
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,209
We discussed this matter..

237
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,472
...with the Joint Commissioner of Police"

238
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,536
"Semen Mishra and he said"

239
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,241
Careful.

240
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,482
Please, sir. You cannot come inside.

241
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,354
This is the ICU. - I..

242
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,449
I'm her husband. -I understand.

243
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,222
I just want to see her.

244
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,625
What has happened to her?
- Please don't disturb her.

245
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:05,595
What has happened to her?

246
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:06,995
Brain's severely damaged.

247
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,123
She's in a state of coma.

248
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,065
The police said it was a minor injury.

249
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,293
Please.

250
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,734
Maria.. - Please don't touch her.

251
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,494
Don't disturb her.
- But..

252
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,199
She can hear, she can see"

253
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,264
"but she cannot respond.

254
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,138
She can hear me?

255
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:21,179
Please don't touch her.
Please don't disturb her. - Maria.

256
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,303
Please, sir.

257
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,677
Mr. John, please.

258
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,443
I just want to talk"
- Don't disturb her. Please, sir.

259
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:30,087
Come, sir. Please. Mr. John.

260
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,055
Maria. - Please, sir.
We're trying our best.

261
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,557
Maria, I'm here. - Sir, please.

262
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,456
Maria, I'm here.

263
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,721
Sir, please don't disturb her.

264
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:36,722
Please.

265
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,258
I'm very sorry, Mr. John.

266
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,593
I know this isn't the time"

267
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,569
"but I'll have to ask
you some routine questions.

268
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,732
Now? - I am sorry.

269
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,674
Did you see any of the robbers?

270
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,107
Anyone?

271
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,474
Anything that you remember?

272
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,378
Any mark on the face?
Any cut? Any mark?

273
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,577
Any evidence that
can help us nab them?

274
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,675
Please.

275
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,718
L.. - I am sorry, Mr.
John, but you can't go home.

276
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,083
Why? - It's a crime-scene"

277
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,955
...and it's not safe enough for you.

278
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,518
Okay, I...will stay here..
- You cannot stay here.

279
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,620
Mr. John, I am so sorry. Please.
- What am I supposed to do?

280
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,392
Why don't you check into a hotel?

281
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:18,630
I'll take you to my friend's hotel.
I'll ask you the rest of the questions there.

282
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,238
I am so sorry, Mr. John. Please.

283
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,168
Come. Please.

284
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,184
Do you have any clue what's going on?

285
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,014
No.

286
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:11,483
What's going on?

287
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,126
You don't know because"

288
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,094
...like always you're drunk.

289
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,191
How many times do I have to tell you?

290
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,067
B***ch! Don't you get it?

291
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,571
I got a call from
the bank this morning.

292
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,610
They were saying something
about a bank-robbery.

293
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,738
I don't remember clearly.

294
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,378
I was way too drunk.

295
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,016
I wasn't in my senses.

296
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,021
Sorry.

297
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,386
If you want to live, stop drinking.

298
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,291
What's the point of staying alive?

299
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,164
To be scared every moment"

300
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:02,407
"that one day you will leave me,
like everyone else.

301
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,975
You will leave me, Gautam, right?

302
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,380
No.

303
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:15,544
You're lying. You're lying.

304
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,149
Do you love me?

305
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,551
Don't start your crap"

306
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,184
Say you love me.

307
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:25,658
You love me, don't you?

308
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:27,429
J ust say it..

309
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:30,628
B***ch! Why did I
save you from the drug scam?

310
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,237
I should've let you rot in jail.

311
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,007
You still haven't
answered my question.

312
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,581
Now listen to me clearly.

313
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,657
You have to go to the
bank day-after-tomorrow".

314
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,422
...and claim your belongings.

315
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,458
You know... how important.

316
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,229
"The Casablanca documents are for us.

317
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,130
Stay in your senses.

318
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,001
And get that treated.

319
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,217
All the phones and
surveillance cameras"

320
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,089
...were already destroyed, sir.

321
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,591
It was a good planning.

322
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,462
But I think they're novices.

323
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,292
They didn't touch some of the lockers.

324
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,471
They were in a hurry, Scoundrels.

325
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,074
The bank manager
doesn't know much, sir.

326
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,370
They tried to kill his wife..

327
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:52,178
"So that they can't
give a description.

328
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,347
Poor thing.

329
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:02,125
They made his life a mess.

330
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,293
He's already living
an unfortunate life.

331
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,741
Do you have any special interest"

332
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,567
...in the bank robbery case, sir?

333
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,011
Nothing special.

334
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,681
When this bank was being built..

335
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,690
...my mom worked here as a labourer.

336
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,452
Labourer...

337
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,029
You sir...

338
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,429
Let it be, sir.

339
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:44,797
I get it.

340
00:31:56,247 --> 00:32:00,081
Sir...will I take bribe from you?

341
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,317
Whores never work for free.

342
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,652
Keep it.

343
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:25,270
My father used to say,
"Money's a dirty thing".

344
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:32,243
So, every time I touch money,
I wash my hands.

345
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,328
'Here. Have juice.'

346
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:53,098
'She's not going on that tour.
That's it.'

347
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,466
'She's 19. She's grown-up.'

348
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,305
'She's not a child anymore.'

349
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,508
'Stop this... possessiveness.'

350
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:01,739
'Let her life her own way.'

351
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,572
'Come on, don't be selfish.
Come on.. - I..'

352
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,707
'Don't. You go cheer her up.'

353
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:17,017
'Pearl. You can go on your tour
or anywhere you want.'

354
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,520
'Dad, thank you, thank you.'

355
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:22,191
'Thank you, daddy.
I love you so much.'

356
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:46,243
Sir. Here's the address
to Mahalaxmi Corporation.

357
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,341
And the residence address"

358
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,546
<i>"of its owner Mr. Framed Pathak.</i>

359
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:51,644
By the way, sir, there
hasn't been any transaction.

360
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,089
...In their account
for the past one year.

361
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:57,685
We tried contacting them,
but no response.

362
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,428
You're aware, sir, that people often"

363
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,034
...do this for saving income tax.

364
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,630
Sir, I think this
company has closed down.

365
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,496
He didn't pay his rent for six months.

366
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,631
Wonder where he disappeared to?

367
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,568
In the end,
I rented out his room to someone else.

368
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:18,114
And...his family? - What family?

369
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,608
He only had a wife.

370
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:22,745
But she left him because
of his habit of drinking.

371
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,619
Yes. He does have a drinking buddy.

372
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,387
Krishnan.

373
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,721
Maybe he can tell you something.

374
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,388
Where can I find him?

375
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,456
He's always at Metro Bar.

376
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,034
Krishnan.

377
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,639
When Krishnan comes here,
give this to him.

378
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,109
Ask him to call on this number.

379
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,741
Who are you, sir?

380
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,081
I'm his friend.

381
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,341
Old friend.

382
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,189
Who...Krishnan?

383
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,665
Who are you?

384
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,025
My name's Michael.

385
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,973
You've to think twice
before giving your name.

386
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,077
Go on. What do you want from me?

387
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,008
I went to see Pramod
Pathak this morning.

388
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,316
But he doesn't stay there any longer.

389
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,087
His landlord told me..

390
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:37,425
...only you can tell
me about his whereabouts.

391
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,732
What do you want from him?

392
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,307
I want to make a real-estate deal.

393
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,042
There are others in the queue.

394
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,703
They are looking for him.

395
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,076
Do you have 25,000?

396
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:01,449
I'll take you to him.

397
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,109
25,000!

398
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,046
Okay.

399
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,657
One minute.

400
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,960
25,000 for his whereabouts"

401
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:13,093
...and 25,000 for
not telling your name.

402
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,589
Do you accept?

403
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,463
Then come see me tomorrow.

404
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,367
"At Vashi subway with 50,000,
at 4 o'clock.

405
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:48,389
Michael?

406
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:51,499
Krishnan? - Yes.

407
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,130
Did you get the money? - Yes.

408
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,165
Feels strange.

409
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,209
A deal between two
strangers is always strange.

410
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:06,948
Yes.

411
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:09,547
Give it.

412
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,152
Is it all here?

413
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,722
<i>Where is Framed Pathak?</i>

414
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,659
He died three months ago.

415
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,497
Why ask me for money?

416
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,227
Are you concerned
about Pramod Pathak"

417
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,339
...or Mahalaxmi Corporation?

418
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,973
How do you know about
Mahalaxmi Corporation?

419
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:37,213
The only interesting thing
in Pramod's useless life..

420
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,306
"Was Mahalaxmi Corporation.

421
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:45,282
What do you know about
Mahalaxmi Corporation?

422
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:51,083
It was a bogus...company. - Bogus?

423
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,497
Think about it.

424
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,762
A drunk peon Pramod turns owner of..

425
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,470
...a company worth 80 million.

426
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,003
Wouldn't you call that bogus?

427
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,199
What? I didn't get it.

428
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,109
It's simple.

429
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,637
Someone else was behind
the dastardly acts..

430
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,111
...and used Mahalaxmi as front.

431
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,349
And who was the scapegoat?

432
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:16,477
<i>Framed.</i>

433
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,179
The company closed overnight.

434
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,547
Shutdown.

435
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,727
Who did the income-tax
and police came after?

436
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,596
One night he suddenly called me.

437
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,393
He said, "My life's in danger."

438
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:29,661
I said, "What can I do."

439
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,529
He said, "I want money."

440
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:36,034
"Lend me some money,
and I'll leave this city forever."

441
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,532
I said, "Okay."

442
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,271
I called him at Metro.

443
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,469
Metro Bar.

444
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,270
I waited.

445
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,375
But he didn't come.

446
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,705
Why?

447
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,183
Why?

448
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,381
He was run-over by a truck.

449
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:04,032
Who are behind Mahalaxmi Corporation?

450
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,165
I don't know, neither did Pramod.

451
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:19,477
But I can tell you that,
they are dangerous people.

452
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,577
Don't get yourself into this.

453
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:28,215
You see if they get a whiff..

454
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,586
"That you're inquiring
about their company"

455
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:35,462
...you will be run-over by a truck too.

456
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,362
I told you, all I knew.

457
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,370
You paid me money, I don't
want anything bad for you.

458
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,507
I'm leaving.

459
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,049
We won't meet again, Michael.

460
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,813
I value my life, buddy.

461
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,031
You know what.

462
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,265
You're an animal.

463
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,596
The most dangerous animal
in the world are humans.

464
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:20,541
And I love this animal.
- Me too.

465
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,746
I mean the animal inside me.

466
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,746
My mom called up today.

467
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:33,721
What was she saying?

468
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:39,692
She was asking when am
I getting married, having a child.

469
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:43,500
So what did you say?

470
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:47,032
I said I'll ask you.

471
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,537
What should I say?

472
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,707
I share a strange relationship
with this world.

473
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:07,221
We both hate each other equally.

474
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,363
I don't know who my parents are.

475
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:23,432
I only knew...
Father Mathews from the orphanage.

476
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,249
I was 9 years old..

477
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:41,649
...when he called me to his room.

478
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,492
He said"

479
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,127
"Don't worry my child."

480
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,364
"It will not hurt."

481
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,473
I was small"

482
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,446
...weak, couldn't do anything.

483
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:11,245
Weakness is the worst disease
in this world.

484
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:21,256
After joining the police force,
I went to see the priest.

485
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,199
But he was dead.

486
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:36,276
I didn't get the answers to my questions.

487
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,543
How can I answer yours?

488
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,218
And I don't want
to give anything to this world.

489
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,294
Love.

490
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:58,792
Forgiveness or a child.

491
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,215
Yes.

492
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:15,411
Gautam sir, Moosa was just here.

493
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,215
He was inquiring about
your business dealings..

494
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,449
...with Anees Pathan.

495
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,424
I didn't tell him anything.

496
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,490
But I sense somethings wrong.

497
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:28,527
What's wrong?

498
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,333
<i>Somethings wrong.</i>

499
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,509
<i>Somethings wrong.</i>

500
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,207
Surely God is good to the upright.

501
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,250
To those who are pure in heart.

502
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,480
But as for me, my feet almost stumbled.

503
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,453
I nearly lost my foothold.

504
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,513
For I was envious of the arrogant"

505
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,320
...when I saw them prosper
in their wickedness.

506
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,492
For they suffer no pain and they're strong"

507
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,157
...in sound of body.

508
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:04,667
Free from troubles common to mortals.

509
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,571
They are not stricken by human ills.

510
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,472
That is why pride becomes their necklace..

511
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,442
...and violence the robe that covers them.

512
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,547
Malice flows out from their pampered fatness.

513
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,310
Evil oozes from their corrupt minds.

514
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,575
They scoff and speak with malice.

515
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:24,450
And in their arrogance
they threaten oppression.

516
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,214
They mouths claim heaven for themselves"

517
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,419
...and their tongues
take control of the earth.

518
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,722
People therefore look up to them..

519
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,465
...and lap up every word they utter.

520
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,397
How will God ever find out, they say.

521
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,062
Is everything known to the most High?

522
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,772
Such are the wicked, always carefree..

523
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,634
...while they rake in riches.

524
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:48,205
In vain, I've kept my heart clean"

525
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:51,213
...and washed my hands in innocence.

526
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,080
Good to see you, sir.

527
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,019
I thought we'll never meet again.

528
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,623
Drink? - No, thanks.

529
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,661
I know you don't like me too much.

530
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:15,000
But if you share a drink with me..

531
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,336
...I'll feel that you've forgiven me.

532
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,500
No, really. Thank you.

533
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:22,676
So, what brought you here?

534
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:29,152
Mr. Ghosh, actually. -Yes.

535
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,389
Go on.

536
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,592
Maybe I shouldn't have come here, I am sorry.

537
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,569
I guess I disturbed you.

538
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,400
I'll leave. - Mr. John.

539
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:56,642
Mr. Ghosh.

540
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,548
I accept your proposal.

541
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,053
But I want something in return.

542
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,333
Beautiful car.

543
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,536
How much for this car, Moosa?

544
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,073
Rascal.

545
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:27,441
Scoundrel. Untie me.

546
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,414
Do you ever dream Moosa?

547
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:36,147
Did you ever see a dream..

548
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,315
...where you're running and suddenly.

549
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,283
...you cannot run anymore.

550
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,555
Gautam, this isn't right. - I see.

551
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:50,625
But don't worry, Moosa.

552
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,370
You won't see this dream again.

553
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,266
Because once I choose my target"

554
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:05,240
"then he can never dream again.

555
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:09,277
You will have to pay for betraying Khan sir.

556
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:15,358
Rascal! Even dogs stay loyal all their life.

557
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:20,189
But remember this betrayal"

558
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:41,518
Your blood's overflowing with loyalty.

559
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,148
Fool.

560
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:54,356
A dog's always a dog,
no matter how loyal he is.

561
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:56,992
He never becomes the master.

562
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,979
Hello, Gautam sir.

563
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:14,348
Anees Pathan. From Dubai.

564
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,044
Get to the point.

565
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:21,483
That's exactly what I like about you.

566
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,025
The deal with AG Group is final.

567
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:26,730
And the money's ready.

568
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:31,124
Just handover the Casablanca documents.

569
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,197
Then Khan will be in my clutches"

570
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:37,502
...and Al Hunain will belong to AG Group.

571
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:41,974
And you will have Rs. 40 million.

572
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,515
No, 50.

573
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:52,986
50?

574
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:56,390
The deal was for 40.

575
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,754
I am making the deal, not you.

576
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:00,757
50.

577
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:07,502
Deal done.

578
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,019
What do you think?

579
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,491
Will the documents be at the bank?

580
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,741
I've done your job.

581
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,651
I hope you will do mine too.

582
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,087
Goodnight.

583
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:01,647
John.

584
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,121
You're forgetting the important thing.

585
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,193
Count it. - No.

586
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:11,132
It's one million.

587
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,504
Thank you. - And...don't worry.

588
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,673
This will stay between us.

589
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:23,108
Just get my job done. - It will be done.

590
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:27,473
Thank you.

591
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,969
You can go. Next.

592
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,110
Tabassum Habi bi.

593
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:14,454
Account no?
- 1114357070.

594
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:17,159
Locker no?
- 216.

595
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,597
What was in your locker?

596
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:23,664
Just some documents.

597
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,326
Property related.

598
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,396
They were kept in a file.

599
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,139
What was the colour of the file?

600
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:31,698
Was anything written on it?

601
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,443
Brown colour file.

602
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,013
Casablanca.

603
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,614
Okay. Please go into
the reclaim room and collect it.

604
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,413
Ma'am, please sit here. I'll just check.

605
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,250
Check your belongings.

606
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,006
What? Do you have a problem?

607
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:34,122
Shinde. I want the Royal Citizen Bank robbers.

608
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,388
Yes, sir.

609
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:36,657
And, listen.

610
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:38,666
You have to do this unofficially.

611
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,462
You will get your price.

612
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:44,132
Just wait and see...Shinde's talent.

613
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:52,079
Gautam. We should get out
of this city as soon as we can.

614
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,007
Maybe, out of the country.

615
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,017
Let's leave.

616
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:58,180
Let's go to Dubai, Singapore..

617
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:11,134
Let's run away before Khan sir finds out.

618
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:15,468
We can live comfortably
with the money that we have.

619
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,133
How long can we run?

620
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,403
<i>Understand this.</i>

621
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,308
The file's intact,
only the papers are missing.

622
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:26,310
Someone wants to implicate me.

623
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:30,577
But who is this new enemy,
I want to find out.

624
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:37,056
Just remember one thing.

625
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,456
I can't see you die.

626
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:49,570
Yes, Shafiq.

627
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:52,040
Khan sir's calling you, Gautam.

628
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:54,037
He wants to talk to you.

629
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:56,101
Come home quickly.

630
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:58,446
I'm coming.

631
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,680
You think Khan sir
has come to know about it?

632
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:44,217
Hello.

633
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,292
Don't you hear the chants?

634
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,157
You'll have to wait 10 minutes.

635
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:59,594
Why do you commit suicide
like this every Friday?

636
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:11,399
It's not suicide or torture,
I just embrace death.

637
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,345
I embrace the pains of life.

638
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:22,710
Pain and life have a deep relation.

639
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:31,158
And no one can escape this pain.

640
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:36,328
It is we who choose pain, Khan sir.

641
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:40,729
Gautam, remember the day"

642
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:44,071
...when you came to me seeking help?

643
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:47,241
As a suspended officer.

644
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:53,580
It's been years since that day.

645
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:59,249
But you're just as arrogant.

646
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:05,016
Since that day I've had a wish.

647
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:08,329
I want to see you shatter.

648
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,490
I want to see you cry, break-down.

649
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:16,128
I want to see tears in your eyes.

650
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:20,775
I want to see a glimpse
of humanity in these eyes.

651
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,549
Tears make humans weak, Khan sir.

652
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,484
Sometimes this tears and pain"

653
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:32,715
"gives us inner strength.

654
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,452
Brings us closer to God.

655
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:40,189
I don't believe in God.

656
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:45,657
You don't believe in Him,
you've to know Him.

657
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:51,232
I don't want to know
anyone other than myself.

658
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:54,508
I am my own Creator.

659
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:59,046
These days you've
been seeing Anees a lot.

660
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:03,742
It's business, Khan sir.

661
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,611
Anees's father and uncle..

662
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,616
...were the taint in our business.

663
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,288
They were traitors.

664
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,163
They couldn't kill me..

665
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:18,193
Instead, they killed my family.

666
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:23,639
I shed lots of blood.

667
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:29,472
I didn't spare anyone
except for women and children.

668
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:33,481
That rascaPs one of them.

669
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:38,281
And now he's been threatening.

670
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:40,652
...my investors in Dubai.

671
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:45,284
They shouldn't face any problem.

672
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:47,729
They're doing business
because they trust me.

673
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:52,628
Its better that Anees understands this.

674
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:58,032
I've sworn not to shed anymore blood.

675
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,066
Put some sense into him.

676
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,545
I'll try, Khan sir.

677
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:18,049
My father used to say"

678
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:21,458
...if you want to burden someone"

679
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:27,227
...then entrust him
with all your faith.

680
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:49,258
I want to see the Casablanca
estates property documents.

681
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:51,592
Bring an application in writing.

682
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:53,388
Get it signed by the authorities.

683
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:54,758
Then you'll get it.

684
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:57,758
That's the procedure.
It will take two weeks. - Two weeks.

685
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:00,025
Maybe...“ can take four.

686
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,528
Suresh. I ordered tea.

687
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,073
Get it quickly.

688
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:11,510
I think... you dropped your envelope here.

689
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,180
I see.

690
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,277
I've been looking for it.

691
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:22,384
Casablanca Estate.

692
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:24,390
Casablanca Estate.

693
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:26,629
Casablanca Estate.

694
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:29,292
Casablanca"

695
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:32,193
Here's Casablanca Estate.

696
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:35,537
Here's the file.

697
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:36,503
Hurry UP-

698
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:38,438
Our boss will be arriving any moment.

699
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,310
The car that they
used for the robbery"

700
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:17,970
"was found in Manori.

701
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:19,581
Through our inquiry, we found out..

702
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,139
"That it was a stolen vehicle.

703
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:25,216
We've finished interrogating"

704
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:28,582
"most of the people that
deal in stolen vehicles in Mumbai.

705
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,083
J ust two left.

706
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:34,762
As soon as we find them,
we'll get a lead.

707
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,599
Don't worry, sir.

708
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:39,599
My informers are at work.

709
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:43,639
What are their names?
- Yadav and Jameel.

710
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:48,009
One's from Byculla and
the other is from Malwani.

711
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:58,150
Are you okay? - Yeah.

712
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,453
Was Khan sir suspicious?

713
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:03,483
No.

714
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:07,496
I want to see you now?

715
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:08,697
Not now.

716
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,229
I'll be late.

717
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:12,501
I see.

718
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,471
Do you know where I am?

719
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:18,030
On the terrace.

720
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:21,741
And everything appears
very tiny from here.

721
01:06:22,244 --> 01:06:23,678
Then jump-

722
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,573
Not once, but twice.

723
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:28,581
Because the terrace is not too high.

724
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:35,018
Sir, I was saying"
- Shinde, hurry up.

725
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:38,084
You're working on bribe,
not salary.

726
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:49,629
Come on. Come in and sleep.

727
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:51,495
But I like it here.

728
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:01,502
Don't take my baby away.

729
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:04,006
Come on.

730
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:19,387
You left my child back there.
- It's okay.

731
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:33,540
Gautam, is it that
difficult to have a family?

732
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,048
It's quite late, get some sleep.

733
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:50,321
My mother had a dream
to have a family.

734
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,725
But her dream was never fulfilled.

735
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:57,732
It remained a dream.

736
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:03,001
She died.

737
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,100
But she passed on her dream to me.

738
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:12,705
And now, my dreams will
never be fulfilled too.

739
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:15,611
Never.

740
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,509
Hello, Gautam sir.

741
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:50,275
I told you not to come here.

742
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,151
What to do, Gautam sir?

743
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:54,714
I had to.

744
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,389
These days you don't
even answer my calls.

745
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:13,404
Make it quick.

746
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:17,546
Casablanca documents.

747
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,310
AG Group's ready with the money.

748
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:26,556
I swear your name will never be leaked.

749
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,625
Once I get my hands
on those documents"

750
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,390
"then Casablanca
project will be ours.

751
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:37,657
Just me and AG Group.

752
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:41,730
Al Hunain and Khan
sir will dance to my tunes.

753
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:44,432
And strip too.

754
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:50,109
I will kill Sikandar
Hayat Khan publicly.

755
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:55,546
It's all in your hands, Gautam sir.

756
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,386
You will get the documents.

757
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:02,180
When?

758
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:11,555
In a week.

759
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:17,070
Okay.

760
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:23,210
I can wait few days more.

761
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:34,454
I'll call again seven days later.

762
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:40,454
Not you, but Sikandar Hayat Khan.

763
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:47,596
Good bye.

764
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:19,160
Hello, uncle. - Hello.

765
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:27,741
Uncle, this is the estate
owner's phone number.

766
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,039
His name is Priyank Dubey.

767
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,414
And these days he stays in Pune.

768
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,210
Thank you.

769
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:38,184
Uncle.. - Enough.

770
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:40,783
Don't say anything.

771
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,753
I hate you, you know that.

772
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:50,527
Because she lied to me because of you.

773
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:52,491
And see what happened.

774
01:12:56,271 --> 01:13:01,004
And I hate you because
she loved you more than me.

775
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:05,977
Sometimes I feel I didn't know her.

776
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,675
You didn't know her, uncle.

777
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:13,013
You think I've no
regrets about her death.

778
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:18,150
She meant everything to me.

779
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:21,490
And music... meant everything to her..

780
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,191
...not your bloody football.

781
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:27,293
She played for your happiness.

782
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:31,271
Because she wanted to fulfill your dreams"

783
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:32,997
...instead of hers.

784
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:34,767
And that's the truth, uncle.

785
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,514
I was selfish.

786
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:17,415
I didn't realise that
she was doing all this..

787
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:20,645
"Because she felt
that she owed me.

788
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:27,496
Now it's my time.

789
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,262
Now it's my time.

790
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,769
Everyone has to pay.

791
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:39,704
I'll make sure
everybody pays for this.

792
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:58,754
Liyaqat.

793
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:01,691
Liyaqat.

794
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:15,674
Shinde sir.

795
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,116
Wow! Great.

796
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:26,477
For the first time I realised"

797
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:30,082
"that silence is a beautiful thing.

798
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:31,420
What's wrong, Shinde sir?

799
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:32,991
All the way here.

800
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:35,695
What brings you here? - I had to.

801
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,496
You got to keep seeing good people.

802
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:41,335
And there aren't too
many good people left.

803
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:44,766
One's Baba Ramdev
and the other one is you.

804
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:48,773
Why don't you say everything clearly?

805
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:49,772
What do you know about"

806
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:51,602
"the Royal Citizen Bank robbery?

807
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:56,647
What robbery?

808
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,248
I don't know anything.

809
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:04,959
Look. Personally,
I don't have a problem with lies.

810
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:07,524
But he does.

811
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:09,188
Who?

812
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:59,111
Few people come to you
with a bank robbery plan.

813
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:02,415
But you refuse to go with them.

814
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:05,143
But you get them a stolen van..

815
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:07,087
...with the help of
your old accomplice Yadav.

816
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:09,313
You even lend them
your drilling machine.

817
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:11,157
You're right.

818
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:12,954
You' re right, Liyaqat.

819
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:14,620
You don't know anything.

820
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,702
I'll tell you, sir. I'll tell you.

821
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,536
Quickly.

822
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:28,568
O bi kwa.

823
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:32,078
O bi kwa, who?

824
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,480
I met him injail.

825
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:37,250
He's a small-time drug-peddler.

826
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:41,511
He asked me to help
him out in the robbery.

827
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:43,621
I did help him.

828
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:45,488
But I wasn't involved in the robbery.

829
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,686
I wasn't involved in the robbery.

830
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:47,723
I wasn't involved in the robbery.

831
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:49,054
I wasn't involved in the robbery.

832
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:50,394
I wasn't involved in the robbery.

833
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:54,033
Who's there?

834
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,099
Sir...it's my son.

835
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:58,635
Keep an eye on him.

836
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:01,064
Sir...sir, please tell him.

837
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:02,300
It's my son.

838
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:04,139
He's just nine years old.

839
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:06,374
Sir. He helps me out in my work.

840
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:10,144
Sir. He's just a kid.

841
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:11,944
Sir. Please spare him.

842
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,351
Sir, he's my son.

843
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:14,981
Stop, sir.

844
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:16,718
Sir, please tell him.

845
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:18,357
Shinde sir, please explain to him.

846
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:20,589
Sir..

847
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:22,187
Sir, listen to me..

848
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:23,629
Sir...he's just a kid.

849
01:18:24,099 --> 01:18:26,295
I swear.

850
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:11,572
Rascal. Couldn't you say it earlier?

851
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:16,144
Who's going to tell
me about Obikwa's whereabouts?

852
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:18,346
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you. - Rascal"

853
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:20,012
You or your father?

854
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:22,250
Manori. Jayanagar.

855
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:25,093
Cottage no.72. Yes, sir.

856
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:27,659
Cottage no.72.

857
01:19:38,473 --> 01:19:39,668
Liyaqat, when you went to jail..

858
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:41,709
...your wife was four months pregnant.

859
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:44,571
Where did you get
this nine year old kid?

860
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:46,104
Meaning?

861
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:51,045
Sir...Liyaqat has
the habits of the nobles.

862
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:52,476
That's why his wife
was having an affair..

863
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:54,215
...with someone else.

864
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:58,457
He's really fond of young kids.

865
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:38,361
Sir..

866
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:39,195
Sir..

867
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:40,325
No, sir.

868
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:04,056
What did you do, sir?

869
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:37,352
Don't be scared.

870
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,422
Everything5 over.

871
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:04,547
You leave, sir. I'll fix things here.

872
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:10,052
Look after the kid.

873
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:02,102
Khan sir wants to meet you.

874
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:04,060
Tell him I'll see him in the evening.

875
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:06,540
Khan sir wants to see you now.

876
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,476
Where?
- Moosa's home.

877
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:46,064
What is it?

878
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:48,008
I want stuff.

879
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:50,478
Stuff? - Yes.

880
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:54,739
I don't have any stuff.

881
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:55,608
Get lost.

882
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:00,516
I told you man I don't have any stuff.

883
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:04,354
Stop disturbing.
- Listen. Liyaqat sent me.

884
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:05,687
Liyaqat?

885
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:08,493
I've never seen you before?

886
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:10,496
<i>Firsbﬂmef? - Yeah.</i>

887
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:13,459
Come in.

888
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:18,537
How's Liyaqat?

889
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:20,404
Fine.

890
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:24,667
How much do you want? - 10 grams.

891
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:27,408
10 grams! That will cost you 40 Grand.

892
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:29,143
Okay.

893
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:32,016
Bathroom?

894
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:35,450
New timer, f'***ing chicken S**t.

895
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:36,718
Go there.

896
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:44,191
There was a call from Al Hunain.

897
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,098
In the last month"

898
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:51,198
...AG Group has given
Anees large amounts.

899
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:54,105
In billions.

900
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:59,278
Threatening our investors.

901
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:03,507
Joining hands with the AG Group.

902
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,154
What does he want?

903
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:14,459
Al Hunain's business rival, AG Group.

904
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:21,435
And AG Group can have
just one interest in Mumbai.

905
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:24,966
And that is Casablanca project.

906
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:34,208
Moosa's death and Casablanca
are surely connected.

907
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:43,082
What do I answer Moosa's widow and children.

908
01:27:48,563 --> 01:27:52,659
Find out. . .where's Anees.

909
01:27:57,238 --> 01:27:59,138
The winds are going to change now.

910
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:49,255
Are you done?

911
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:52,187
Shell out the money.

912
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:57,461
Hurry UP-

913
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:02,168
What do you have there?

914
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:06,098
Who the **** are you?

915
01:29:06,307 --> 01:29:09,038
The bank manager.

916
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:13,205
Royal Citizen Bank. - What?

917
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:15,241
What the **** do you want?

918
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,217
What do you want?

919
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:23,013
Who was in my house that day?

920
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:25,156
Who was in my house?

921
01:29:28,496 --> 01:29:31,431
Who was that ba****d in my house?

922
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:32,632
It was Ranade.

923
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:33,997
Ranade.

924
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:35,596
Where is he?

925
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:37,195
Where is he?

926
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:40,238
He's...in room 113.

927
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:42,072
Saroja Lodge, Dahisar.

928
01:29:42,577 --> 01:29:43,738
Please don't kill me.

929
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:46,105
I am sorry. I am sorry.

930
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:48,314
I am sorry. Please don't kill me.

931
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:49,976
Please don't do that.

932
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:51,615
I am sorry.

933
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:28,681
Shinde. Obikwa's dead.

934
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:32,454
I think they're killing
each other for the money.

935
01:30:33,761 --> 01:30:35,354
The blood's still fresh.

936
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:37,154
Do one thing.

937
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:40,166
Setup check-posts all around Manori.

938
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:42,698
N ow!

939
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:05,452
What the"

940
01:31:06,594 --> 01:31:07,425
Mambo.

941
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:08,623
Wretch.

942
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:18,296
Who is it?

943
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,201
I'm not done yet.

944
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:29,007
Who is it?

945
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:31,109
Bu",
c h!

946
01:31:32,753 --> 01:31:34,414
Rascal"

947
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:02,414
What's your wife's name?

948
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:04,745
Rita.

949
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,583
Love marriage?

950
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:12,025
Love-marriage?

951
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,253
How long?

952
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:16,426
Five years.

953
01:32:21,569 --> 01:32:23,560
How old is your kid?

954
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,030
Three years.

955
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:30,210
What's her name?

956
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:36,211
Lovely.

957
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:43,216
If I shoot you now..

958
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:45,784
"What will happen to them?

959
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:54,294
I don't have time, Mambo.

960
01:32:56,771 --> 01:32:59,297
Either you or them.

961
01:33:00,608 --> 01:33:02,042
Decide.

962
01:33:07,281 --> 01:33:10,307
There's a rundown factory at Dahisar.

963
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:14,184
That's where you will find them.

964
01:33:27,535 --> 01:33:29,731
Everyone's not fortunate
enough to have a family.

965
01:34:28,763 --> 01:34:30,424
Stop, stop.

966
01:34:31,732 --> 01:34:34,326
Check them quickly.

967
01:34:40,107 --> 01:34:41,700
Let them go.

968
01:34:43,144 --> 01:34:44,475
Stop.

969
01:34:44,779 --> 01:34:46,247
Step out.

970
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:49,680
Show me your license.

971
01:34:55,489 --> 01:34:56,615
It's okay.

972
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:58,125
Where are you coming
from at this hour?

973
01:34:58,192 --> 01:35:00,456
There was a prayer meeting
at my friend's place.

974
01:35:00,494 --> 01:35:01,655
Christmas season.

975
01:35:01,729 --> 01:35:04,130
So late?
- Had to go.

976
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:06,963
Sir. There's nothing in the car.

977
01:35:07,168 --> 01:35:09,034
Except for this Bible.

978
01:35:12,339 --> 01:35:14,671
Sir, we've been waiting
here for so long.

979
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:19,436
I wonder what they must
be doing with the money.

980
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:24,545
Why did you join the
police force, Shinde?

981
01:35:25,252 --> 01:35:26,481
It's a funny story.

982
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:30,491
In my childhood,
I saw Bachchan's 'Zanzeer'.

983
01:35:31,258 --> 01:35:32,692
I really liked it.

984
01:35:33,027 --> 01:35:37,464
That's when I decided I'll
be an honest police officer.

985
01:35:40,468 --> 01:35:43,438
I never realised
when I turned corrupt.

986
01:35:44,672 --> 01:35:46,265
And when I did..

987
01:35:47,374 --> 01:35:49,365
...I thought this is best.

988
01:35:55,282 --> 01:35:57,046
Life's really strange, sir.

989
01:35:58,686 --> 01:36:03,089
A three-hour movie changed my life.

990
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:10,026
Sir, if you don't mind
can I ask why did you join?

991
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:16,228
My story's somewhat similar.

992
01:36:18,572 --> 01:36:20,336
The only difference is..

993
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:26,644
...It took three hours
to change your life.

994
01:36:31,185 --> 01:36:33,677
And three minutes to change mine.

995
01:36:35,489 --> 01:36:38,322
It's a pretty bad situation, Prakash.

996
01:36:38,392 --> 01:36:41,191
I should explain to
you from the beginning.

997
01:36:43,531 --> 01:36:47,627
25 kilometres away from Lonavla,
about five years ago.

998
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:50,604
There was about 8000
acres of forest land..

999
01:36:50,671 --> 01:36:52,298
...which the government reclassified"

1000
01:36:52,373 --> 01:36:54,432
...and classified
it as agricultural land.

1001
01:36:54,575 --> 01:36:56,475
Now as soon as this happened..

1002
01:36:57,278 --> 01:37:00,475
...a Dubai based real
estate firm called Al Hunain..

1003
01:37:00,614 --> 01:37:03,311
...with the help of
Sikander Hayat Khan and..

1004
01:37:03,384 --> 01:37:07,412
...ACP Gautam produced 70 fake farmers.

1005
01:37:07,555 --> 01:37:08,579
They took their signatures"

1006
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:10,090
...and took possession of 6000 acres.

1007
01:37:10,191 --> 01:37:12,455
And renamed it Casablanca.

1008
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:15,425
This thing was a bloody scam, Prakash.

1009
01:37:15,529 --> 01:37:17,122
There were no such farmers.

1010
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:19,326
They only existed on papers.

1011
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:22,061
But this bloody thing
gets even worse, Prakash.

1012
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:24,638
Two years ago that place caught fire.

1013
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:27,566
They called it a fire-accident"

1014
01:37:27,641 --> 01:37:29,405
...and the case was closed.

1015
01:37:29,977 --> 01:37:31,342
But the truth was that"

1016
01:37:31,412 --> 01:37:34,006
...Al Hunain had intentionally
set that place ablaze.

1017
01:37:34,114 --> 01:37:35,172
And these ba****ds.

1018
01:37:35,249 --> 01:37:37,217
They didn't just claim
the insurance, but"

1019
01:37:37,284 --> 01:37:39,378
...as soon as this place was included"

1020
01:37:39,453 --> 01:37:41,615
...in urban development, they okayed..

1021
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:44,158
...a petition for Casablanca Township.

1022
01:37:44,558 --> 01:37:46,322
Who ever questioned about
this fire-accident"

1023
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,454
there mouths were shut.

1024
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:51,529
Few were bribed.

1025
01:37:51,665 --> 01:37:53,599
Like Thomas Xavier,
fire department chief.

1026
01:37:53,667 --> 01:37:55,658
And few were threatened.

1027
01:37:55,736 --> 01:38:00,003
Like Mr. Priyank Dubey,
owner of the estates where pearl died.

1028
01:38:00,507 --> 01:38:02,373
And all these transactions were..

1029
01:38:02,443 --> 01:38:04,036
...carried out under the pretext"

1030
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:05,579
...of a bogus company
called Mahalaxmi Realtors"

1031
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:07,478
...which was setup by Al Hunain.

1032
01:38:07,648 --> 01:38:09,639
This is not just Al Hunain, Prakash.

1033
01:38:11,285 --> 01:38:13,014
The entire state machinery.

1034
01:38:13,487 --> 01:38:16,718
...and the entire disgraceful,
corrupt system"

1035
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:18,425
...is a part of this scam.

1036
01:38:19,226 --> 01:38:20,523
This file has the name and details"

1037
01:38:20,594 --> 01:38:23,086
...of all the people
connected to this scam.

1038
01:38:23,664 --> 01:38:29,501
Evidence to some legal
and mostly illegal transactions.

1039
01:38:30,471 --> 01:38:31,529
But..

1040
01:38:32,306 --> 01:38:33,432
...John.

1041
01:38:34,441 --> 01:38:37,274
Why don't we take this to the police?

1042
01:38:40,514 --> 01:38:45,543
Because I don't want justice,
I want destruction.

1043
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:49,352
Who else knows about it?

1044
01:38:51,191 --> 01:38:52,454
Me and..

1045
01:38:52,993 --> 01:38:55,655
...my special correspondent
Prakash Nair.

1046
01:39:00,467 --> 01:39:02,697
Give Joshi his account number.

1047
01:39:04,705 --> 01:39:06,605
We'll make Prakash happy.

1048
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:08,398
Sure.

1049
01:39:10,210 --> 01:39:12,235
By the way, what does John Day want?

1050
01:39:14,515 --> 01:39:18,042
I heard that he doesn't want justice,
but destruction.

1051
01:39:23,223 --> 01:39:24,657
John Day.

1052
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:46,212
Obikwa and Ranade are dead.

1053
01:39:47,114 --> 01:39:50,709
Take your share
and get out of the city.

1054
01:39:51,719 --> 01:39:53,551
If one's caught we'll all get caught?

1055
01:39:54,288 --> 01:39:55,619
Did you find out who killed them?

1056
01:39:55,689 --> 01:39:58,386
Don't worry, we'll find out now.

1057
01:39:58,559 --> 01:40:00,425
We thought you killed them.

1058
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:02,155
For their shares.

1059
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:15,008
Where are the documents?

1060
01:40:15,142 --> 01:40:17,008
Documents? What documents?

1061
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:20,276
Casablanca Estate!

1062
01:40:20,347 --> 01:40:22,645
What Casablanca documents?

1063
01:40:23,217 --> 01:40:24,776
Sir..

1064
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:26,514
Sir, is this the same Casablanca"

1065
01:40:26,587 --> 01:40:28,385
...where there was a
fire accident two years ago?

1066
01:40:28,455 --> 01:40:30,446
Where a girl died?

1067
01:40:31,025 --> 01:40:32,083
Yes. why?

1068
01:40:32,226 --> 01:40:34,024
Oh no! Sir.

1069
01:40:34,361 --> 01:40:35,590
Exactly.

1070
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:38,799
She was his daughter.
The bank manager's.

1071
01:40:39,299 --> 01:40:40,664
John Day, sir.

1072
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:45,263
You mean..

1073
01:40:47,074 --> 01:40:50,442
Rascal. Why didn't
you tell me earlier?

1074
01:40:50,511 --> 01:40:51,501
Sir, how would I know..

1075
01:40:51,578 --> 01:40:53,171
...which documents you were looking for?

1076
01:40:53,247 --> 01:40:55,409
I asked you before,
but you didn't say.

1077
01:40:55,516 --> 01:40:56,745
What could I do?

1078
01:41:03,257 --> 01:41:04,622
Rascal"

1079
01:41:05,659 --> 01:41:08,651
That scoundrel bank manager..

1080
01:41:10,631 --> 01:41:12,599
Got us all killed.

1081
01:41:26,747 --> 01:41:27,771
Wasn't that right, sir?

1082
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:29,443
Put the money in the bag.

1083
01:42:27,107 --> 01:42:29,439
Scoundrel.

1084
01:42:32,646 --> 01:42:34,637
You people will never change.

1085
01:42:37,784 --> 01:42:41,015
You can't kill me with your service revolver.

1086
01:42:43,023 --> 01:42:44,286
There will be an enquiry.

1087
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:49,186
I'm not a fool like you..

1088
01:42:49,496 --> 01:42:51,521
...to bring my service revolver here.

1089
01:43:56,697 --> 01:43:58,290
I'm looking for John Day.

1090
01:43:58,699 --> 01:44:00,724
He just went down
wearing a grey jacket.

1091
01:44:29,463 --> 01:44:33,161
Come on, uncle. First the documents,
then we'll go see Khan sir.

1092
01:44:34,001 --> 01:44:35,594
Come on.
Ratan, hurry up.

1093
01:44:35,669 --> 01:44:37,068
Get in.

1094
01:44:57,658 --> 01:44:59,717
Tabassum, listen to me carefully.

1095
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:02,586
Wake up and listen to me very carefully.

1096
01:45:03,063 --> 01:45:04,963
Go to our Alibaugh bungalow tonight.

1097
01:45:05,032 --> 01:45:07,023
And don't tell anyone
where you're going.

1098
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:09,194
And don't answer
anyone's call, please!

1099
01:45:09,436 --> 01:45:11,495
Do not drink. Please!

1100
01:45:11,571 --> 01:45:12,629
Tonight's the night.

1101
01:45:12,973 --> 01:45:14,463
We might have to
get out of here tonight.

1102
01:45:14,608 --> 01:45:16,167
Are you okay?

1103
01:45:17,110 --> 01:45:18,305
I don't know.

1104
01:45:26,386 --> 01:45:27,615
Stop here.

1105
01:45:28,755 --> 01:45:30,382
Why stop here?

1106
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:33,025
The documents are with my friend.

1107
01:45:33,193 --> 01:45:34,524
He lives here.

1108
01:45:38,098 --> 01:45:41,295
Anwar, go along. - Okay.

1109
01:45:41,635 --> 01:45:43,103
Keep a lookout.

1110
01:46:04,124 --> 01:46:05,148
Hurry UP-

1111
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:27,394
Hit him!

1112
01:48:38,111 --> 01:48:39,010
Enough.

1113
01:48:46,086 --> 01:48:46,985
Speak up!

1114
01:48:47,153 --> 01:48:48,552
Where are the documents?

1115
01:48:48,655 --> 01:48:50,384
Speak up!
Speak up!

1116
01:50:28,555 --> 01:50:30,785
Come here.
Are you alone?

1117
01:50:31,224 --> 01:50:33,386
Here you go, sir.
your work is done.

1118
01:50:33,693 --> 01:50:35,559
Here are your tickets to Bangkok.

1119
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:36,790
As soon as you get down at Bangkok..

1120
01:50:37,063 --> 01:50:38,656
...my man will give
you tickets to China.

1121
01:50:38,732 --> 01:50:40,530
And from China to Bahamas.

1122
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:42,398
You can show this note there.

1123
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:45,063
You'll get your money delivered.

1124
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:55,705
Only you know where I am heading.

1125
01:51:07,093 --> 01:51:08,561
Don't worry.

1126
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:11,629
You're lucky.

1127
01:51:14,601 --> 01:51:15,500
Sir.

1128
01:51:16,002 --> 01:51:17,094
I found out.

1129
01:51:17,203 --> 01:51:20,468
John Day.
He overpowered Shafiq and his men.

1130
01:51:20,774 --> 01:51:22,264
He escaped.

1131
01:51:22,509 --> 01:51:24,273
Shafiq's in hospital.

1132
01:52:31,711 --> 01:52:33,008
I had to do it, John.

1133
01:52:34,414 --> 01:52:39,352
Otherwise they would've killed me.

1134
01:52:40,019 --> 01:52:41,578
L.. Sorry"

1135
01:52:41,688 --> 01:52:43,486
I had no choice.

1136
01:52:45,725 --> 01:52:50,686
Associate Editor's post...or death.

1137
01:52:52,232 --> 01:52:53,256
Surly--

1138
01:52:53,333 --> 01:52:56,462
You say...what could I do?

1139
01:53:00,306 --> 01:53:02,274
All I want to know is..

1140
01:53:03,576 --> 01:53:05,476
...whom did you sell yourself to?

1141
01:53:09,082 --> 01:53:10,379
His name.

1142
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:38,399
In the last five years,
you've received Rs. 12 billion..

1143
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:41,778
...from an organization
called Al Hunain.

1144
01:53:45,018 --> 01:53:46,110
Remember?

1145
01:53:48,221 --> 01:53:50,053
You were the mayor of the city then.

1146
01:53:52,325 --> 01:53:54,623
I've your bank account number..

1147
01:53:56,196 --> 01:53:59,029
...and all the details
of those transactions.

1148
01:54:04,237 --> 01:54:05,363
Please.

1149
01:54:09,542 --> 01:54:10,634
What do you want?

1150
01:54:10,710 --> 01:54:13,543
I want to meet your boss.

1151
01:54:15,081 --> 01:54:16,310
Call him.

1152
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:22,318
And stop sweating like a pig.

1153
01:54:26,192 --> 01:54:28,217
No one's ever talked to me like this.

1154
01:54:28,361 --> 01:54:31,126
There's a first time for everything,
Deshmukh.

1155
01:54:32,398 --> 01:54:34,025
Call him.

1156
01:54:36,669 --> 01:54:39,263
Shall I remind you the name?

1157
01:54:40,173 --> 01:54:41,538
Si kander Hayat Khan.

1158
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:35,755
Any specific reason to meet here?

1159
01:55:37,697 --> 01:55:41,190
The story should end where it started.

1160
01:55:43,636 --> 01:55:46,469
I deeply regret your daughter's death.

1161
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:50,537
Unintentionally,
I committed a big crime.

1162
01:55:52,211 --> 01:55:54,771
I didn't know she
was there at that moment.

1163
01:55:56,215 --> 01:55:58,274
Yet you're responsible for her death.

1164
01:56:01,387 --> 01:56:06,188
Your daughter's death will
always be a burden on my soul.

1165
01:56:08,328 --> 01:56:09,693
Shall we get to the point?

1166
01:56:12,031 --> 01:56:13,089
Okay.

1167
01:56:22,575 --> 01:56:24,441
When is your husband coming?

1168
01:56:31,718 --> 01:56:33,550
Does he love you?

1169
01:56:38,391 --> 01:56:40,621
If he really loves you..

1170
01:56:40,693 --> 01:56:43,663
"Then he will return my documents.

1171
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:52,768
People do everything for love.

1172
01:56:55,108 --> 01:56:56,098
Everything.

1173
01:57:23,202 --> 01:57:25,967
There's someone who
loves me just as much.

1174
01:57:30,643 --> 01:57:32,577
Her name is Tabassum.

1175
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:39,417
She loves me like crazy.

1176
01:57:48,461 --> 01:57:50,190
And I do too.

1177
01:57:55,334 --> 01:57:57,132
But I can't tell her.

1178
01:58:00,306 --> 01:58:02,104
I'm afraid that"

1179
01:58:05,011 --> 01:58:07,139
...it might make me weak.

1180
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:16,646
But once I'm out of this mess.

1181
01:58:21,094 --> 01:58:23,290
Then even I'll have a family.

1182
01:58:25,398 --> 01:58:26,991
Just like you.

1183
01:58:37,376 --> 01:58:39,242
Hello. - Gautam, don't come here.

1184
01:58:39,312 --> 01:58:41,280
Who's there? - Me.

1185
01:58:41,714 --> 01:58:45,582
John Day. Manager, Royal Citizen Bank.

1186
01:58:46,552 --> 01:58:49,214
I've your Casablanca documents.

1187
01:58:49,388 --> 01:58:51,652
Don't hurt Tabassum.

1188
01:58:52,125 --> 01:58:53,752
I'm with your wife in the hospital.

1189
01:58:54,026 --> 01:58:55,323
I can do anything.

1190
01:58:55,461 --> 01:58:58,556
You cannot do anything
and you know that.

1191
01:58:59,765 --> 01:59:01,961
If you want to talk, come here.

1192
02:00:00,326 --> 02:00:01,088
Why?

1193
02:00:02,762 --> 02:00:06,721
He had a reason to do all this.

1194
02:00:08,568 --> 02:00:10,058
What about you?

1195
02:00:12,505 --> 02:00:14,371
What do you think I should do now?

1196
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:38,443
If you're finally satisfied,
then leave.

1197
02:03:39,378 --> 02:03:41,369
Before anyone sees you.

1198
02:03:43,215 --> 02:03:45,274
The job's not done, Khan sir.

1199
02:03:47,019 --> 02:03:50,546
And you were never going
to get those documents.

1200
02:03:53,259 --> 02:03:55,523
I am surely at peace today

1201
02:03:56,762 --> 02:04:00,426
but looking at you
I feel disturbed, I pity you.

1202
02:04:02,034 --> 02:04:03,559
Go ahead shoot.

1203
02:04:04,203 --> 02:04:06,262
Free me from this burden.

1204
02:04:07,306 --> 02:04:13,302
But be ready to carry a
new burden on your soul.

1205
02:04:15,347 --> 02:04:20,114
Because today's my end..

1206
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:23,548
...and your beginning.

1207
02:04:25,057 --> 02:04:26,252
Shoot.
