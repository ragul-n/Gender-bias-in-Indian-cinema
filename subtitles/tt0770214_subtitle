1
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,835
11th September, 2001.

2
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:07,413
The twin towers came down in New York.

3
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:12,078
And suddenly, the world's attention
turned to Afghanistan.

4
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:15,917
A country ravaged by war, for 23 years.

5
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:20,495
With Osama bin Laden and
the Taliban by their sides...

6
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:23,661
...the U.S. started bombing Afghanistan.

7
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:28,033
The Taliban were a group of
religious extremists...

8
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:32,266
...who had occupied Afghanistan with
Military support from Pakistan.

9
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:38,339
It reported that Pakistani soldiers
had also entered Afghanistan...

10
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,512
...to fight alongside the Taliban.

11
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,253
After 9/11, Pakistan deserted the Taliban...

12
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,048
...and the northern alliance Mujahiddeen,
took over Kabul.

13
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:56,430
A country that had been closed
to the world for long six years...

14
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:58,158
...suddenly opened up!

15
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:02,536
Thousands of Journalists went in by
any means possible.

16
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:06,703
To capture this exciting time,
in the history of Afghanistan.

17
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:11,411
Among them were Suhel and Jai.

18
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,834
So dude... Are you enjoying being
a war reporter?

19
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:38,462
Balls, I'm enjoying this!

20
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:40,238
If only we'd listened to our parents...

21
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:42,367
...should've become a doctor...
or an engineer...

22
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:44,877
But no... we had to go and
become journalists!

23
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:50,118
Why did you have to tell the boss...

24
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,620
...that we would get an interview
with the Taliban... or die trying...

25
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,281
Now you'll die... definitely!

26
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:59,592
Hey, how was I to know that
our lives will really be at risk!

27
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,827
These guys carry guns like
we carry mobile phones...

28
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,233
One of them even had a rocket launcher,
did you see?

29
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:09,237
Not even 3 days since we got into
this Afghanistan...

30
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,531
...and here we are stuck in this mess.

31
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:24,638
Who are you guys?

32
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:27,480
We want to go to Kabul!

33
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,482
Where are you from?

34
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,818
Ah... India. Hindustan. - Oh,
Hindustan!

35
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:37,484
Amitabh Bachchan... (Indian Superstar)

36
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:39,392
Amitabh Bachchan! Yes!

37
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,096
Aamir Khan... Shahrukh Khan... (Indian Actors)

38
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,265
Aamir Khan... Shahrukh Khan... correct.

39
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,191
Dharmendra... Jeetendra... (Indian Actors)

40
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:49,597
Yes... Dharmendra... Jeetendra...
Does this guy only like men?

41
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,404
Yeah... That's what I've heard about them.

42
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,173
Kabul? - Kabul?

43
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,838
Hello... hello... we need to go to Kabul...

44
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:05,514
Hello... bring the vehicle... understand?

45
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:29,437
Let's go to Kabul.

46
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:31,444
Doesn't this place have taxis?

47
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:32,755
Hotel Kabul.

48
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,090
Looks like a 5 star...

49
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:51,540
You're gonna get me killed one of these days.

50
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:53,539
Why did you have to promise the boss...

51
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:55,614
Stop repeating yourself!

52
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:57,341
Why not?

53
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:00,949
You be the hero if you must...
Why are you after my life?

54
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:04,826
And this bloody Khyber... he's the one
who got us stuck in this mess...

55
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,492
What did I do?

56
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:11,397
The first day you met us you said
you would take us to the Taliban...

57
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:15,496
You guys went on and on about
wanting to meet the Taliban...

58
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:16,364
Now meet them.

59
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:33,210
At it, again?

60
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:52,298
Come on... Want to exercise?

61
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:15,362
Come... Let's go... I've contacted
some Mujahideen

62
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,829
who have held some Pakistani Taliban.

63
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:20,425
They've hidden these guys
in the mountains. C'mon...

64
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,706
Will they let us interview them?

65
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:39,077
Of course! That's why they've
been kept alive...

66
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:43,124
...for interviews... in exchange of money.

67
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,352
If caught alive, a Talib is priceless these days.

68
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:49,161
How much will they charge?

69
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,590
I was told 200 dollars.

70
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:53,694
That's a bit too much, man!

71
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:56,638
But we do need the interview.

72
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,406
OK, what else will they do for 200 dollars?

73
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,469
I guess they might dance for you
on the mountain tops!

74
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,811
Let's go...!

75
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,370
Do you think these guys will come?

76
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:44,216
They should be here anytime.

77
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:49,448
But they have to be cautious.

78
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,988
This stuff is risky!

79
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,561
No one should know they've got
some Taliban prisoners.

80
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,211
Are these the guys?

81
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:17,516
Doctor, I can't see a thing!

82
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:22,557
Doctor, I can't see a thing!

83
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:38,698
Khyber, ask them how much further?

84
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:41,809
What? -Ask them how far is this place?

85
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:44,140
No... They'll get angry.

86
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,543
Screw them. Why are you so scared?
They won't shoot you for asking.

87
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:52,478
Mujahid brother... how far is it?

88
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:41,703
What happened?

89
00:13:44,006 --> 00:13:46,133
Looks like the Taliban prisoners have run away...

90
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:47,933
Our Taliban?

91
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:50,870
You mean the ones we paid for?
- Yes!

92
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,875
Will they refund our money?

93
00:13:57,686 --> 00:13:58,277
I'll ask...

94
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:00,152
Will they even come back?

95
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:04,951
Shit, this is real bad luck!

96
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:09,961
What the hell...

97
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:19,398
Talib...

98
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,155
There go 200 dollars...

99
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:39,361
The camera... Are you mad?

100
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:44,821
You asked them for a refund!
Do you want us killed?

101
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:46,159
Why shouldn't I?

102
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:49,565
And You! Why didn't you take a shot?

103
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:51,203
At least we would have proof
that we saw a Talib.

104
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:54,001
What? You need to be alive to
show the proof. And you?

105
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:55,073
Why didn't you interview him?
You should have asked him.

106
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:56,437
Where are you running away,
Mr. Taliban?

107
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,012
Who would you like to shoot first?

108
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:02,206
Me or my mad friend who is shooting you?"

109
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:06,417
You have lost it! Refund! Refund!

110
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:21,101
What the hell is that?

111
00:15:22,237 --> 00:15:25,536
The opening shot of our story...
Buzkashi.

112
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,050
Buzkashi is being played first time
in Kabul after 8 years.

113
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,916
The Taliban had banned this sport.

114
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:45,660
Why?

115
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:49,029
They said it's too violent!

116
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,328
Those Taliban guys were a riot...

117
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:55,604
Come. Let's get into the field and shoot.

118
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:59,565
Be careful. People also get killed in this.

119
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:02,069
What? You get killed when you go to pee...

120
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:03,175
...you get killed when you go to play...?

121
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:05,213
What the hell can you do here?

122
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:16,549
Suhel, you stay right behind me.

123
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:19,419
Through the camera I can't judge
their distance from me.

124
00:16:19,795 --> 00:16:20,853
Just warn me, okay?

125
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,620
Come, I am there. - I am there!

126
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,697
Come on... let's go over there and shoot!

127
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,833
You want me killed!
- C'mon, let's go!

128
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:10,578
Suhel, that pack of horses is headed this way.
- Be careful.

129
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,851
Hey guys... Watch out!

130
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,251
What the hell!

131
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,609
You want to kill me?

132
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,582
I told you guys to be careful! People die in this.

133
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,087
I saw that Talib in the crowd.

134
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,087
You are so shit scared that
you are beginning to hallucinate!

135
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:58,859
You couldn't see the whole army of horses...

136
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:02,857
...and you saw that bloody Talib?

137
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:04,330
Jai... Believe me... I saw that man.

138
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,166
Screw it. Those horses could have killed me...

139
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:08,732
I'm leaving this job.

140
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,848
Oh... Indian Cigarette! -Yes.

141
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,357
Can I have one please?

142
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,227
Thank you.

143
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:18,239
Hey you Santa Claus...
taken my cigarette...

144
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:19,237
...now send me the kebabs fast.

145
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:21,534
I hope everybody here doesn't do this.

146
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:25,238
Why are you such a scrooge?
It's just a cigarette!

147
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:29,844
You know the problem... I have only
one carton of cigarettes.

148
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,117
Any other brand hurts my throat.

149
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:38,216
Do I look like a cigarette wending
machine to him?

150
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:50,832
Khyber... why do only women beg
on the streets?

151
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,934
They don't have an option.

152
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:58,778
Almost half the women are widows.

153
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,514
The Taliban stopped all women from working.

154
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:11,116
They were not allowed to leave home unless
escorted by a male relative.

155
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:15,728
If a woman was spotted alone on the streets...

156
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:20,198
...they would beat her like an animal.
Bastards.

157
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,866
That's why I hate them so much.

158
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,668
Some of them are still hiding around.

159
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:32,338
If we catch them, we will beat
them to death. Scoundrels!

160
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:38,246
Can we please do an interview
before you kill them? Thank you.

161
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:44,449
General Musharraf has dubbed
the recent public uprisings...

162
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,457
...as a conspiracy by radical groups.

163
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:52,892
He said that most Pakistani political
groups are unhappy...

164
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:57,800
...with his decision to help American
in the war against terrorism.

165
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,464
These groups have joined the Afghan refugees...

166
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,302
...to protest against the government...

167
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,978
...but their efforts have been unsuccessful.

168
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:09,640
See how quickly the Pakistan government
has dumped the Taliban.

169
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,415
They created the Taliban...

170
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:16,489
and now they say they will help the Americans
in destroying the Taliban.

171
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:20,489
Bloody liars... they are killing their
own people.

172
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,323
In Afghanistan's Kunduz area...

173
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,432
...more than 50 Taliban have been killed by
the Northern Alliance Mujahidin.

174
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:27,829
Down with the Taliban! -Allah is great!

175
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:48,854
President Musharraf is unhappy
about institutions like madrassas...

176
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,356
...and masjids being used for
anti religious activities.

177
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,528
In the battle that's been going
on for three days...

178
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,857
...near Mazar-e-Sharif in Afghanistan...

179
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,363
...more than 200 Taliban have been killed.

180
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,697
Hear that?

181
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,131
God alone knows how many amongst
them were our men...

182
00:22:04,606 --> 00:22:07,871
And the guys sitting in Islamabad
are telling the world...

183
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,711
...that none of our men are in Afghanistan.

184
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,046
And there, across the border...

185
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,881
...the Afghans are hunting them
down like wild animals.

186
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,044
And our government is doing
nothing to protect them.

187
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:22,620
The American dollar is worth much more
than fellow countrymen.

188
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:26,791
You have only 4 months of service left.

189
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,660
Why bother yourself over politics?

190
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:33,457
We can do nothing about it.

191
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:43,974
There! The bloody American Special Forces...

192
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:44,977
...have brought another truckload!

193
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,048
The bastards herd them like cattle...

194
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,256
God knows how many of our men
are in these Taliban...

195
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,606
Is he asking us to fire?

196
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:17,270
Careful! Make sure you don't get him.

197
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,191
Khyber, I completely agree with you.

198
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:39,124
The Taliban did some really horrible things...

199
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,700
...but not respecting women is the worst.

200
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:44,804
How can you not respect women...?
Oh boy! What a hot babe...

201
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:45,973
I bet she's coming this way!

202
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:47,971
What a smile!

203
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,743
You guys seem to be the center
of attraction wherever you go.

204
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,811
That was some great dodging
you did on the field. - Thank you.

205
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:56,141
Hi! I'm Jessica Beckham from Reuters.

206
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,320
Suhel. That's...-Jai. -Jai. Khyber.

207
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,486
We work for a news channel,
back home in India.

208
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:08,152
Really? That's cool... Not much really
left to cover now, is it?

209
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:11,091
I mean, Taliban regime collapsing...

210
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:14,268
...life coming to normal in the war
torn Afghanistan.

211
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,931
US government sending more troops...
usual stories... aren't they?

212
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:22,569
I mean rookies do that kinda stuff...
don't they?

213
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,007
And I believe all this is anyway
not half shocking or horrifying...

214
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,012
...as what went on here in the last five years.

215
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,344
Please give her something to eat...

216
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,851
...or she won't stop speaking. - Sorry?

217
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,191
No... he just wants to know,
what will you have for dinner.

218
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:40,688
Didn't realize we have a choice here.

219
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:46,857
Kebabs for breakfast, Kebabs for
Lunch, Kebabs for dinner!

220
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,195
And oh... if you want a snack...
Kebabs again!

221
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,865
Kebab... naan.

222
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,640
So, have you guys done war before?

223
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,546
No. this is our first time...
we are rookies.

224
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:10,655
So what do you think will make an
interesting story to do in post 9/11 Kabul?

225
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,387
Well... get Osama I guess...

226
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,794
...or if not Osama, then a chat
with Mullah Omar.

227
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:21,332
That will give your network some ratings.

228
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,572
As far as I am concerned...
I'll be content.

229
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,904
Over and done with this blessed place if...

230
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,741
...if I can get up close with a Taliban fugitive.

231
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:34,815
But they've all disappeared, either dead,
or in hiding. - Rubbish!

232
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,352
We found one... the bloody guy almost got us
killed at the Buzkashi.

233
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,361
Kebabs for dinner.

234
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,830
So, your name is Jessica Beckham.

235
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:54,358
Nice name. do you play football?

236
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,361
So where did you guys see this Taliban?

237
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,840
C'mon guys. How does one get
to these Taliban?

238
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,603
He's talking bullshit as usual.

239
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,276
Don't take him seriously.

240
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,446
If you'll excuse us, we should
really be leaving.

241
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,618
We have an early morning shoot tomorrow.
- Oh, really? Where?

242
00:26:14,022 --> 00:26:19,722
Sufi singing at the mosque...
it's really fan... nice.

243
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:29,970
Thanks again for saving our lives.
Bye. - Bye.

244
00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:34,875
Man, can't we take her along?

245
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,978
You are always horny... you see a white
woman and get all excited!

246
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:42,409
Dude... A flower blooms in the desert and
you ask what color it is?

247
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:44,407
At least we are seeing a woman.

248
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,817
All the local stuff has been packed up...

249
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,887
...in Burkha by the bloody Taliban!

250
00:26:49,457 --> 00:26:50,822
What does Horny mean?

251
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:53,420
One whose brain is not in his head
but down below!

252
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,821
Why are you looking at me?

253
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,323
Why did you have to reveal all
our plans to her?

254
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,227
Why? Are we taking an exam here?

255
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,994
Yes... It is an exam

256
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:04,094
If we don't take back an exclusive
story from here...

257
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,336
...you will spend the rest of your life
shooting boring...

258
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,008
...press conferences of fat politicians.

259
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:13,674
Jai. In life, you get just one shot
at war reporting.

260
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,782
We have got it... Understand man!

261
00:27:19,654 --> 00:27:21,679
Go away from here! - 1 second.

262
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:29,246
Super footage man! These guys go
into this weird trance.

263
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,255
Yeah... better than what the trance
music we listen.

264
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:34,595
Oh Shit!

265
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:39,325
Keep driving. Don't stop the car.

266
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,277
Take the car towards the Pakistan border.

267
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,606
If anyone stops and inquires...

268
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:56,613
...tell them you're news reporters
And I'm your guide.

269
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:01,118
If you make one wrong move,
I will shoot you.

270
00:29:02,056 --> 00:29:03,284
I'm not scared of dying...

271
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:07,118
...and believe me, I'll kill all of
you before I die.

272
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,130
But we're only journalists...
Why are you taking us?

273
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,459
I don't need to repeat myself.
Do exactly what I say.

274
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,971
If you need the car, please take it.
Why do you need us?

275
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,972
Shut up and keep driving!

276
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:32,817
It'll take us one full day to reach the border.
We don't have enough fuel.

277
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,982
Stop cribbing you idiot and keep driving!

278
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,171
Hyder! You need to hurry up.

279
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,072
Dirt in filter. Take 5 minute.

280
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:04,114
Hey guys! How rude!

281
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,081
What's a woman doing at the back
of their car?

282
00:30:10,825 --> 00:30:13,623
Please get it started soon,
we must follow them.

283
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,201
Look in front.

284
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,343
You stay here.

285
00:31:08,716 --> 00:31:09,580
You go.

286
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,252
Remember what I told you.

287
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:19,920
If I see anything suspicious I will
kill these two. Go. - Damn it!

288
00:31:41,883 --> 00:31:43,783
Stop! Where are you headed?

289
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:48,454
Hello. Do you Speak Hindi?

290
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:53,055
Hindi... Yes... Yes... - Oh god.

291
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:55,460
We are journalists from India...

292
00:31:55,763 --> 00:32:00,791
We want to go towards the border.
Will you please lift the roadblock?

293
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,128
Yes... Yes...

294
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,641
Will you remove it? -Yes... Yes

295
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:12,636
You don't understand a word...
Do you?

296
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,405
Yes... Yes...

297
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:17,483
What's up, friend? Where have you been?

298
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,210
When are we going to Kabul next?

299
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:24,082
How've you been? Are you keeping well?

300
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,824
What the bloody hell is he doing?
Who's that guy?

301
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,230
No, we've only met him once before.

302
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:37,994
He's not a friend... They kiss here for no
rhyme or reason!

303
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,333
Why have you kept him waiting here?

304
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:46,611
God knows. I kept nodding Yes...
Yes like they do in their films.

305
00:32:46,814 --> 00:32:50,250
Shut up! Look before you start
speaking to people.

306
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,583
Where's your friend?

307
00:32:56,491 --> 00:32:58,959
Is he in the car? Let's say
hello to him.

308
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:05,196
Why are they coming here? I told him
I don't want trouble!

309
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,267
Everything will be fine.
Suhel will handle it.

310
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,299
I think he just wants to say Hello.

311
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:20,372
How are you? Are you keeping well?

312
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,309
That is our guide. We need to make a move.

313
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:26,214
Will you please remove the roadblock?

314
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,889
Hey! Lift the roadblock.

315
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:41,059
Lift the roadblock and let these guys go!
- Thank you.

316
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:09,420
Give me one cigarette.

317
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,429
I don't want to give him my cigarettes.

318
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,493
Tell him about your throat.

319
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,433
Cigarette!

320
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,119
Thank you.

321
00:34:43,598 --> 00:34:46,362
Where is this cigarette from? - India.

322
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,706
It's nice. - I know.

323
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:07,652
You guys don't need to be scared!
You only need to drop me to the border...

324
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,985
But how can we...?

325
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,263
You are journalists... nobody will stop
you on the way.

326
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:23,326
If you act sensibly... you'll be able
to reach home alive

327
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:27,841
No problem... we'll do as you say.

328
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,015
Jai...

329
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:38,950
Roll one shot at least!

330
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,285
Ya right... you ask the questions,
I'll roll the camera.

331
00:35:43,491 --> 00:35:45,288
I am serious. - So am I

332
00:35:55,636 --> 00:36:00,539
I'm Jai... I'm a cameraman from India.
What's your name?

333
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,207
Imran... Imran Khan Afridi

334
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:14,385
Very powerful name... Imran Khan...
(Pakistani Cricketer)

335
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:17,722
Do you play cricket?

336
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:23,729
Why? Does everybody in India named
Sachin (Indian Cricketer) go around with a bat?

337
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,723
No... I was only asking...

338
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:35,000
But Imran Khan is a great cricketer...
wasn't he?

339
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,737
Yes he was the greatest all rounder
in the world!

340
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,575
Ya... he was pretty good

341
00:36:43,684 --> 00:36:46,676
He was No. 1... the best in the world.

342
00:36:48,055 --> 00:36:53,186
Now that's a bit too much. No. 1 was always
Kapil Dev. (Indian Cricketer)

343
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:55,760
Number 1 all-rounder. -Who...?

344
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:01,932
Kapil Dev... Kapil brother...
number 1 all-rounder.

345
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,603
What nonsense are you talking about?

346
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,772
Kapil's nothing in front of Imran Khan!

347
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:08,767
How would you know? You had
banned TV.

348
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:13,273
Kapil's records are better than Imran in every field.

349
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,780
Records mean nothing. Imran was No. 1!

350
00:37:17,084 --> 00:37:17,709
What shit are you talking?

351
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:20,444
Everybody knows that Kapil was a better
all rounder. Isn't that true?

352
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,122
How the hell does it matter
who was number one.

353
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,290
They are both retired now...
aren't they?

354
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:27,550
What you mean, how does it matter?
Of course it matters...

355
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:30,390
Cricket is a bloody waste of time man!

356
00:37:30,598 --> 00:37:33,294
11 players stand on the field, scratching
their crotches all the time.

357
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:37,399
See... even your friend doesn't
know about Kapil.

358
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:38,739
This bugger has no clue about anything!

359
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,307
All he does is body building all day long.

360
00:37:42,877 --> 00:37:43,866
Look ahead.

361
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,819
Kapil Dev is a better player...
Bloody traitor!

362
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,658
Throw this out.

363
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:41,533
This was one of the most fertile lands
in Afghanistan.

364
00:38:42,803 --> 00:38:46,034
The grapes from here were exported
all over the world.

365
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:51,710
Nothing remains today... it's all over!

366
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:56,707
These guys destroyed everything.

367
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,281
What did they gain from destroying
my beautiful country?

368
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:06,224
Why blame others? You guys
have been fighting...

369
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,794
...amongst yourselves for the last 25 years?

370
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:15,094
Had Pakistan not interfered, Afghanistan
wouldn't look like this today.

371
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:18,328
Well, Pakistan has also provided shelter...

372
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:19,733
...to you guys for the past 20 years.

373
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,407
You have been eating our food for free
and then you talk about war.

374
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,544
We didn't start the war, you did!

375
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:28,237
Shut up... and keep driving.

376
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:35,854
Why should I shut up? It's a fact?
You started the war?

377
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:39,288
Now tell me bastard...
who started this war?

378
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:48,257
Yes... We Afghans started it ourselves...

379
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:58,106
Bastard... talks too much.
Now shut up and keep driving.

380
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:02,573
Cigarette!

381
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,398
Here goes another American bomber!

382
00:40:27,942 --> 00:40:29,739
That's the 12th since morning.

383
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,213
I just had a talk with the Colonel.

384
00:40:36,884 --> 00:40:40,820
We've been given strict orders to seal the border.

385
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:43,147
All of you will have to be alert.

386
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:46,588
But Sir, our men are still crossing the border.

387
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,922
And who told you that the ones crossing
the border are our men?

388
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:57,402
Not a single Pakistani is in Afghanistan.
Is that clear?

389
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:11,943
The Colonel has got the same order
from the High Command.

390
00:41:13,154 --> 00:41:15,122
Make sure this post is ready by evening.

391
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,864
There goes... our bloody High Command!

392
00:41:28,702 --> 00:41:30,067
Stop here!

393
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:34,841
Take the keys out and come with me.

394
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,640
You two stay here!

395
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:43,414
Move.

396
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,213
What the hell is he doing?

397
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:53,223
He's pissing?

398
00:42:12,012 --> 00:42:13,036
Oh hell... he'll get us killed!

399
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:19,917
Get into the car... fast!

400
00:42:35,836 --> 00:42:38,168
Do any of you know how to drive?

401
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,535
Do you know how to drive or not?

402
00:42:44,912 --> 00:42:46,937
We don't even have a license.

403
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:49,612
I swear...

404
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:10,234
Get inside the car!

405
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:34,458
Why are you taking our passports?

406
00:43:35,996 --> 00:43:38,521
I don't need to answer anything.

407
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:45,498
Jai Kapoor...

408
00:43:53,314 --> 00:43:54,611
Suhel Khan...

409
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:06,923
After the recent bombing in Kandahar...

410
00:44:07,127 --> 00:44:09,652
...the American bombers have now started
targeting areas near Jalalabad.

411
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:11,023
Bastards!

412
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:15,527
Now that they don't need us,
they're dropping bombs on us...

413
00:44:16,337 --> 00:44:18,828
That too from 30,000 feet above...

414
00:44:19,506 --> 00:44:21,497
Come down and fight, you bastards!

415
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,609
This guy's crazy!

416
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,877
They'll drop a bomb on us!

417
00:44:29,817 --> 00:44:33,480
Where the hell are you headed?
Get back on the road!

418
00:44:33,787 --> 00:44:35,448
This is also a similar route.

419
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,817
If we get back on the road, the Americans
will bomb us!

420
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:38,787
Shut up!

421
00:44:38,992 --> 00:44:41,222
Hello, are we going in the right direction?

422
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,392
You said this is the way to Pakistan.

423
00:44:44,331 --> 00:44:46,526
We're going on and on, and we haven't
seen them yet.

424
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:48,399
Is it dangerous around here?

425
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:52,504
Khyber is right. You don't know the power
of American technology.

426
00:44:52,706 --> 00:44:57,473
I'm not scared of your Americans!
What's the big deal about them?

427
00:44:57,978 --> 00:44:59,946
I thought the Americans were yours
till yesterday...?

428
00:45:01,048 --> 00:45:03,016
Now he realizes...

429
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:09,922
The Americans are loyal to no one.
- Shut up.

430
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,084
You chaps seemed very happy
taking money...

431
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,123
...from the Americans to fight the Russians?

432
00:45:14,328 --> 00:45:17,729
Yes we did... but only to defend our country.

433
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:19,362
Unlike you guys...

434
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,200
...who took money from the Americans...
and then...?

435
00:45:22,403 --> 00:45:25,930
Please! There's no point in fighting like this.

436
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,439
You're sensible. Tell your driver to shut up
and keep driving.

437
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,370
We need to halt for the night.

438
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:38,449
This bastard always has a problem!
We can't stop. Keep driving.

439
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,314
My brother... Please don't start
all over again...

440
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:45,587
Why don't you just do as you are told?

441
00:45:45,926 --> 00:45:46,984
How can I?

442
00:45:47,728 --> 00:45:51,027
The Americans bomb every car
that moves at night.

443
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,266
And if we escape the Americans,
the Hazara will surely get us.

444
00:45:54,468 --> 00:45:55,799
Now who is this Hazara?

445
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,770
The Hazara Mujahidin control this area.

446
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:06,643
These guys are the most brutal criminals
in Afghanistan.

447
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:14,115
In order to save bullets they ram a nail
into your head to kill you.

448
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,947
It's cheaper that way.

449
00:46:17,424 --> 00:46:22,623
Ya right... The longest nail should go
into your head!

450
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,992
Who is that?

451
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,833
I don't know! This area shouldn't
have a check post.

452
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,501
Slow the car down.

453
00:46:47,788 --> 00:46:49,346
I can't believe it. He ran away.

454
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,189
Khyber, what a horror story...
He got so scared that he ran away.

455
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:59,359
But it's a true story. The guys ahead
are actually Hazara.

456
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,363
You are joking... right? - No.

457
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:18,548
We were kidnapped by a Talib. And I think
he saw you and ran away.

458
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,379
So... he must be somewhere around here.

459
00:47:21,822 --> 00:47:23,050
What's he saying?

460
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:28,217
They are journalists from India, and we had
been kidnapped by a Talib.

461
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:29,895
He ran away upon seeing you.

462
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,223
Correct. He ran away.

463
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,232
Journalists. India.

464
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:52,582
Keep smiling at them... but I suspect
something is seriously wrong here.

465
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,582
Why are you saying that?
Is this smile fine?

466
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:17,435
Shit!

467
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,783
We have to take them to the commander

468
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:34,293
Commander...? But these guys
are journalists.

469
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,621
Don't argue. We have to take them.

470
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,632
They say they are the local commander's men.

471
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:49,806
They want to file your report on the Talib.
- Come.

472
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,313
Not you... just these two.

473
00:48:56,516 --> 00:49:01,647
They want just the two of you to follow them.
I'll have to stay here.

474
00:49:03,256 --> 00:49:05,850
Suhel... be careful.

475
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,831
Suhel, pull your jacket down from behind.
- Why?

476
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,830
Do you have to ask "why" for everything?
Pull it down, will you? -Why?

477
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,499
Forget it!

478
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,689
What's up?

479
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,200
Move!

480
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,579
They were Hazara gunmen.

481
00:50:35,148 --> 00:50:36,080
They would have looted you...

482
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:41,585
...driven a nail into your heads, and sold
your car in Pakistan.

483
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,752
Give me a cigarette.

484
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:55,594
Thanks for saving our lives.

485
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,438
No need to thank me.

486
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:12,778
I need you alive in order to reach the border.

487
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:17,957
You sonofabitch!

488
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,123
What's the difference between you
and these bastards?

489
00:51:21,895 --> 00:51:25,262
You both kill to suit yourselves.

490
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,966
Bastard, you pissed on me.

491
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,962
Now I'll shoot you and leave you
here with these dogs.

492
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:37,974
But before you die, let's hear from you...
who started this war...?

493
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,645
Speak up, you Bastard!

494
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,975
We did! -Who?

495
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,482
Pakistan!

496
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:50,990
Take his gun away.

497
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:03,825
Release the lock! -Where is it?

498
00:52:05,105 --> 00:52:08,165
OK. Forget it. Might go off by mistake...

499
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,180
Now let's hear you, you dog...

500
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,008
...who was the best all rounder...
Kapil or Imran?

501
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,685
Jai, this is no time to fool around.

502
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,186
I'm not fooling around. Tell me bastard!
Kapil Dev or Imran Khan?

503
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,686
Kapil Dev.

504
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:35,061
I will take this bastard to Kabul and
hand him over to the Americans.

505
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,693
I'll get a reward. - No. We won't
be able to sleep...

506
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,373
...won't be able to pee...
Let's leave him here.

507
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,710
Let's tie him up and leave him here.

508
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:46,879
Give me your gun.

509
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,745
Go ahead... do your thing.

510
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:38,764
Mind blowing!

511
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,940
How do these Americans reach everywhere?

512
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,940
Look, Taliban.

513
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,628
Do it now at least! - Can I?

514
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,457
Shoot! You horny bastard!

515
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,983
OK. Enough shooting!

516
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,821
Can I get one last cigarette?

517
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,994
What? You have already had
so many of my cigarettes.

518
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,168
What if I get a sore throat? - Grant a
dying man his last wish...

519
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,675
Haider, you carry on with the car.
I will come back with these guys...

520
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,682
...If that's fine with you guys?
- Oh no problem at all.

521
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,684
The seat next to me is absolutely empty...

522
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,857
I must really thank you guys.

523
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,356
I was pretty sure they were
going to rape me.

524
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,859
Naah! I think they were more
interested in your driver.

525
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:54,055
Khyber! You're a hero! -Jai, at least
now your cigarettes are safe.

526
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:57,566
Yeah! The bastard must be puffing
his last cigarette.

527
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,568
Bastards, they ate all my chocolates.

528
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:07,242
Thank God, they did not mess up
my camera and passport.

529
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,245
Passport! - Passport?

530
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:14,079
That bastard's still got our passports.
- Let it be... Get new ones made.

531
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:15,855
It's not a suit I'm talking about.

532
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:16,784
They're passports.

533
00:56:17,023 --> 00:56:18,581
How do we leave this hellhole
without passports?

534
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,259
Even if we get out, how do
we enter India?

535
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,586
No, let's go back and get them.

536
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,263
What? Are you mad? You want to go
back to that maniac?

537
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,432
So what? It's been only 5 minutes
since we left him.

538
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,100
He's all tied up anyway.

539
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,268
I told you we should have shot
the bastard.

540
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,272
This time we'll kill the bastard.

541
00:56:42,715 --> 00:56:44,945
But why did you give your passports
to a guy like that?

542
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,116
Here, she's started her interview again...

543
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,117
...let's take her back and tie her up again.

544
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:52,950
What did he say? - Nothing.

545
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,626
Shit!

546
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:03,295
The bastard's gone! I told you
we should kill him.

547
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:04,799
I've lost my reward too!

548
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,468
Grant a dying man his last wish...

549
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:14,980
What do we do now?

550
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,143
We'll have to go to the Indian Embassy.

551
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:19,978
That was bombed long time back!

552
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,319
Let's get out of here.

553
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,151
Their men must be headed this way...

554
00:57:26,426 --> 00:57:30,658
...I think that's why he also ran away.
Let's go.

555
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,000
I told you to leave the passports
back in the hotel.

556
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:42,004
Hotel? You call that war monument a hotel?

557
00:57:42,242 --> 00:57:44,176
There's no ceiling in that place!

558
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,353
Oh! Shit!

559
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,220
Tell that bastard to hand over his pistol.

560
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:38,890
Stop the car!

561
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:48,229
Get out! All of you! Get your cameras along.

562
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,734
Shoot his pics!

563
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,440
Shoot his pics... just like you shot mine!

564
00:59:43,529 --> 00:59:44,621
Who is this white woman?

565
00:59:46,065 --> 00:59:47,396
She is an American journalist.

566
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:52,631
Can't take her along. It's too dangerous
to have her with us.

567
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:58,637
I will have to leave her here.
But we can't leave her alive!

568
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,811
Tell him I have a Pakistani visa.

569
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,246
This can justify our going towards the border.

570
01:00:05,652 --> 01:00:09,213
What did she say?
- She says she has a Pakistani visa.

571
01:00:09,889 --> 01:00:10,355
If somebody inquires...

572
01:00:10,556 --> 01:00:12,490
...we can say we need to drop
her to the border.

573
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,752
Does she know how to drive?

574
01:00:18,164 --> 01:00:20,655
She's American... she must know...

575
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:23,761
Car...? drive?

576
01:00:24,003 --> 01:00:25,766
Drive? Does he mean drive?

577
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,104
We're dead!

578
01:00:28,574 --> 01:00:30,701
Of course I drive, I am an American!

579
01:00:42,655 --> 01:00:48,685
Imran Sahab. He's the only one who knows
the way to the border.

580
01:01:05,812 --> 01:01:09,304
Can you see that smoke ahead?
- Stop the car!

581
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:18,284
Diesel! Fill her up.

582
01:01:29,869 --> 01:01:32,303
This is what happens when you
drive in the night.

583
01:01:33,339 --> 01:01:35,307
The Americans must have bombed
these trucks.

584
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:52,749
It's Coke! - No, it's not coke.

585
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:59,559
What? It's Coke.
- It's too sweet, it's Pepsi.

586
01:01:59,866 --> 01:02:02,528
What's the difference?
They are both the same bloody thing.

587
01:02:03,236 --> 01:02:08,435
What's the difference?
Why are you so vague in life?

588
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,106
Imran Khan and Kapil are the same thing!

589
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,777
Coke and Pepsi are the same thing!

590
01:02:15,214 --> 01:02:18,081
Jessica listen. You are an American.

591
01:02:18,451 --> 01:02:20,851
Can you tell us if this is
Coke or Pepsi?

592
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,015
I don't drink either.

593
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:26,181
You don't drink Coke?
What sort of American are you?

594
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:29,994
A sensible sort.

595
01:02:41,707 --> 01:02:43,368
I told you its Pepsi!

596
01:02:55,054 --> 01:02:56,817
The war is all about this...

597
01:02:57,056 --> 01:03:01,891
...the Americans will do anything to
sell their Coke and Pepsi...

598
01:03:02,094 --> 01:03:03,527
...this is exactly what they do. Suck all
the oil out of a country...

599
01:03:03,729 --> 01:03:06,061
...and then fill it with Coke and Pepsi...

600
01:03:06,899 --> 01:03:10,562
Why's he yelling at me?
I don't even like Coke... or Pepsi.

601
01:03:10,803 --> 01:03:14,466
It's all about money isn't it?
For you Americans?

602
01:03:20,646 --> 01:03:22,079
I also want money.

603
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:26,549
How much do you get for these
photographs of Taliban?

604
01:03:27,687 --> 01:03:28,676
What's he saying?

605
01:03:28,921 --> 01:03:31,412
He's asking how much you get
for these photographs.

606
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:36,358
How many dollars for photograph
of Taliban?

607
01:03:38,297 --> 01:03:43,599
I don't know. Maybe 5, maybe 6 hundred...
- How much?

608
01:03:44,103 --> 01:03:47,095
She says 500 to 600 dollars.

609
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:51,175
All right... I will take 300 dollars!

610
01:03:52,011 --> 01:03:55,208
What? - He wants 300 dollars.

611
01:03:57,350 --> 01:04:01,411
If you don't give money,
then I will snatch your camera.

612
01:04:26,512 --> 01:04:29,606
We are from a poor country like yours.

613
01:04:32,518 --> 01:04:34,179
We don't even get so much salary.
I swear!

614
01:04:35,187 --> 01:04:37,246
This guy hasn't even got his salary
for the last two months.

615
01:04:38,858 --> 01:04:39,688
Isn't it?

616
01:05:35,081 --> 01:05:38,573
So Suhel, won't you offer your prayers?

617
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,258
Oh! Of course... you are an Indian Muslim...

618
01:05:49,295 --> 01:05:51,490
...what would you know about Islam...?

619
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:57,263
You're right, what would we know
about Islam?

620
01:05:59,005 --> 01:06:01,337
You are the guardians of our faith...

621
01:06:02,642 --> 01:06:06,408
You keep an AK56 on your side
and then pray.

622
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:30,085
His name isn't Imran.
He is from the Pakistani army.

623
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,527
I can give him more money if he wants.

624
01:07:56,055 --> 01:07:57,682
Salaam! Where is the American journalist?

625
01:07:58,724 --> 01:08:00,214
She's coming with the Indian journalists.

626
01:08:00,626 --> 01:08:01,820
Commander! The American journalist is not here.

627
01:08:02,027 --> 01:08:04,518
He says that she is coming with
the Indian journalists.

628
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:06,197
They're not here? He came alone?
- Yes!

629
01:08:06,398 --> 01:08:12,030
Hold him back till the journalists reach here.
Ask him to park his car.

630
01:08:12,571 --> 01:08:16,234
Park your car there and get down.

631
01:08:33,959 --> 01:08:36,393
If his name is not Imran,
why did he fight so much?

632
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:44,225
Whose photograph was that?

633
01:08:45,771 --> 01:08:47,295
There she begins her interview again!

634
01:08:47,807 --> 01:08:49,536
Not only will she get herself killed,
but us too!

635
01:08:50,176 --> 01:08:51,404
Whose photograph was that?

636
01:08:57,082 --> 01:08:58,606
This was my daughter...

637
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:00,275
Was?

638
01:09:04,523 --> 01:09:05,512
Zoya.

639
01:09:10,196 --> 01:09:12,289
Haven't seen her in six years.

640
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:14,089
Why?

641
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:19,334
How could I? I have been fighting
this war for 6 years

642
01:09:19,538 --> 01:09:21,972
What's he saying? -We'll tell you later.

643
01:09:22,675 --> 01:09:23,972
Is she in Pakistan?

644
01:09:25,711 --> 01:09:27,770
No. She stays here in Afghanistan.

645
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:35,543
I got her married in a village,
this side of the border.

646
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:42,292
Our village is very close to the border
on the other side.

647
01:09:43,395 --> 01:09:45,420
So why didn't you ever meet her?

648
01:09:47,466 --> 01:09:49,457
I tried once,

649
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:55,005
But she refused to meet.

650
01:09:59,545 --> 01:10:05,245
Because I was in the Taliban, and
she didn't approve of this.

651
01:10:08,387 --> 01:10:10,753
She did not like their way of thinking...

652
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:13,751
...their behavior towards women...

653
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:17,920
...using force in the name of religion...

654
01:10:21,367 --> 01:10:23,494
Were you OK with all that?

655
01:10:23,869 --> 01:10:24,893
No!

656
01:10:27,273 --> 01:10:29,639
My views were different.

657
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:34,377
Then why were you with them?
- I was not with them.

658
01:10:36,715 --> 01:10:38,148
I was only doing my duty.

659
01:10:38,617 --> 01:10:43,350
You've got to obey orders in the Army.
It's my right to do my duty.

660
01:10:43,789 --> 01:10:45,689
What kind of duty, Imran sir?

661
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:49,123
Performing that you have to be ashamed
of your own children?

662
01:10:56,101 --> 01:10:57,534
Go to sleep.

663
01:10:58,938 --> 01:11:03,932
We're very near the border. We'll leave
early tomorrow.

664
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:16,984
I was sure he's gonna shoot me.

665
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:20,554
Yeah, you crossed the line today.

666
01:11:25,965 --> 01:11:29,162
You almost seem to enjoy these wars.

667
01:11:29,668 --> 01:11:35,834
Me? Well... after every trip to
these hell holes...

668
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:41,274
...I promise myself never to return. But...

669
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:42,845
But you break your promise!

670
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:49,752
And you know why? To sell
some more gore.

671
01:11:50,823 --> 01:11:53,519
Some more inhuman horror
stories to the world...

672
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:56,889
...that chose to do nothing when this
place was burning.

673
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,799
And you know why I am doing it?

674
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:12,104
I hope publisher's will line up for my book...
when I write all this.

675
01:12:14,346 --> 01:12:16,576
But what else do you think reporters can do?

676
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:30,222
Nothing, I guess. Other than knowing
in their hearts...

677
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:37,057
That whatever they do... is not enough.

678
01:12:53,385 --> 01:12:54,409
What have you done?

679
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:04,395
Where are the reporters?
They haven't come as yet. It's really late.

680
01:13:04,663 --> 01:13:07,962
There's a small problem.
When the Indian reporters saved...

681
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:09,759
...us from the Hazara,
there was a Talib with them.

682
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:12,698
Talib?
Why didn't you tell that to me before?

683
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:16,439
There were a lot of people.

684
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:18,200
I thought they'll tie the Talib up.
But I think they're in trouble.

685
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:20,310
Tomorrow early morning, we must go there.

686
01:13:43,068 --> 01:13:44,467
Get in!

687
01:13:46,605 --> 01:13:47,970
Come on, guys!

688
01:14:11,163 --> 01:14:13,427
We must drive out of this area fast.

689
01:14:13,966 --> 01:14:15,263
What happened now?

690
01:14:15,734 --> 01:14:18,703
This village is famous in Afghanistan
as the village of thieves.

691
01:14:18,904 --> 01:14:19,598
Why?

692
01:14:20,139 --> 01:14:25,873
When they see a foreigner in a car,
they push a donkey onto the road.

693
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,445
The moment the car hits the donkey...

694
01:14:28,647 --> 01:14:30,376
...the entire village comes running out...

695
01:14:30,582 --> 01:14:31,549
...screaming and shouting...

696
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:33,684
It was a special donkey... a priceless donkey...

697
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:40,883
He had studied in a school.
- An educated donkey!

698
01:14:41,093 --> 01:14:41,957
And then?

699
01:14:42,161 --> 01:14:45,460
Then they strip you of all your money...
and sometimes...

700
01:14:45,664 --> 01:14:47,723
...even your clothes.

701
01:14:47,933 --> 01:14:49,992
Great! That's all we needed!

702
01:14:51,003 --> 01:14:54,097
But we don't need to worry. -Why?

703
01:14:54,306 --> 01:14:56,297
Because ever since the Taliban collapsed...

704
01:14:57,209 --> 01:15:00,804
...so many English journalists
have passed this way...

705
01:15:01,513 --> 01:15:04,311
...that all the donkeys in the village must be over...

706
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:10,616
Some still remain... Now they drive cars...

707
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,515
Looks like a suicide bomber.

708
01:16:10,449 --> 01:16:11,780
Bloody terrorist!

709
01:16:13,085 --> 01:16:15,315
Shit! Sorry... it wasn't meant for you.

710
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:50,154
Where are they? Show me!

711
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:51,549
They were right here.

712
01:16:53,058 --> 01:16:55,492
Where are they? I don't see anyone around.

713
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:58,094
I don't know where they've gone. -You're lying!

714
01:16:58,297 --> 01:16:59,924
No! I swear to God they were here.

715
01:17:03,969 --> 01:17:04,993
Move!

716
01:17:40,839 --> 01:17:46,573
"Whatever I received, I accepted as destiny..."

717
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:56,451
"Whatever I received, I accepted as destiny..."

718
01:17:56,655 --> 01:18:02,218
"I accepted as destiny..."

719
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:10,868
"What got lost, I kept forgetting that..."

720
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:16,598
"What got lost, I kept forgetting that..."

721
01:18:16,808 --> 01:18:20,209
"Every worry I decided to blow away as smoke..."

722
01:18:29,888 --> 01:18:32,356
Perfect mood for a cigarette!

723
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:36,355
Sure! Sure!

724
01:18:50,242 --> 01:18:54,076
Amazing! You're fond of Hindi songs?

725
01:18:54,279 --> 01:18:55,541
Old Hindi film songs are my weakness...

726
01:18:55,747 --> 01:18:57,112
...used to stealthily listen to Indian Radio as a kid...

727
01:18:59,017 --> 01:19:02,453
Later I saw a lot of your films also.

728
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:05,979
Didn't the Taliban ban Hindi films?

729
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:09,688
They were uncultured idiots.

730
01:19:12,931 --> 01:19:14,421
I have been saying for years...

731
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:22,433
Give us Madhuri Dixit (Indian Actress)
and take Kashmir...

732
01:19:24,776 --> 01:19:27,040
She's gone now. Married and settled in America.

733
01:19:28,046 --> 01:19:32,244
Everything nice that we have finally
goes away to America.

734
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:04,704
What's the matter? What's going on here?

735
01:20:04,916 --> 01:20:06,645
Some Taliban were trying to escape
towards the border.

736
01:20:06,852 --> 01:20:07,682
We've captured them.

737
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:09,285
Talib? -Yes, Talib!

738
01:20:11,623 --> 01:20:14,649
These guys have captured two Taliban...

739
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:16,953
...who were trying to escape towards the border.

740
01:20:17,162 --> 01:20:19,289
They are killing them with their bare hands.

741
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,865
Who are they?

742
01:20:23,468 --> 01:20:25,299
Indian journalists!

743
01:20:25,637 --> 01:20:28,970
Indian journalists? Come take some pictures.

744
01:20:29,174 --> 01:20:31,540
He says you should come out and shoot.

745
01:21:27,766 --> 01:21:28,630
What do you say Suhel?

746
01:21:31,436 --> 01:21:32,528
Should we tell them about him?

747
01:21:36,207 --> 01:21:38,971
No, Jai. Let's get out of here.

748
01:21:51,456 --> 01:21:52,718
You guys should go to Torkhan.

749
01:21:52,924 --> 01:21:54,221
You'll get more pictures of Taliban there.

750
01:21:54,426 --> 01:21:56,894
The American's have just bombed that area.

751
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:03,794
He's saying we must go to Torkham.

752
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:06,232
Many Taliban soldiers were hiding there...

753
01:22:06,438 --> 01:22:07,871
...and the Americans have bombed that area heavily.

754
01:22:08,073 --> 01:22:12,635
Hundreds have died.
He says you will get great shots.

755
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:20,083
Ask them the way to Torkham.

756
01:22:23,488 --> 01:22:24,785
I think we're lost!

757
01:22:25,457 --> 01:22:29,484
No, he said keep going down the straight road.

758
01:22:29,995 --> 01:22:31,826
This road looks straight to you?

759
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:33,722
Dude! Do you think you will find a
road straighter than this here?

760
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:34,927
You have a point.

761
01:22:44,809 --> 01:22:46,868
By the way, Imran Sahab,
why are we going to Torkham?

762
01:22:47,412 --> 01:22:50,609
My daughter's village is in Torkham.

763
01:22:52,651 --> 01:22:54,949
Do you know exactly where the village is located?

764
01:22:55,153 --> 01:22:56,415
I have a faint idea...

765
01:22:58,723 --> 01:23:00,486
But how will I meet her?

766
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,623
It can be dangerous for her.

767
01:23:05,163 --> 01:23:08,724
A man can't ask for a woman's whereabouts here.

768
01:23:09,634 --> 01:23:12,364
Then meet her the same way you met us.

769
01:23:16,174 --> 01:23:19,473
Burkha! - No I can't do that.

770
01:23:19,678 --> 01:23:20,702
Why not?

771
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:25,077
You were happily running all around
Kabul in that Burkha.

772
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:26,876
No its different here.

773
01:23:27,886 --> 01:23:32,414
If I get caught, my daughter Zoya will be in trouble.

774
01:23:34,325 --> 01:23:35,485
Then what do we do?

775
01:23:37,295 --> 01:23:38,387
What's he saying?

776
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:45,065
What?

777
01:23:52,744 --> 01:23:54,644
I can't believe I am doing this.

778
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,260
Oh shit! I am, so sorry.

779
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,090
I knew she could play football.

780
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,696
Oh shit! I am so sorry. Are you okay?

781
01:24:18,903 --> 01:24:20,598
What are you doing?

782
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:23,535
What are you doing? Stop it!

783
01:24:28,246 --> 01:24:28,837
I got hurt!

784
01:24:29,047 --> 01:24:30,878
I am so sorry.

785
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,376
Aunty!

786
01:24:33,852 --> 01:24:34,580
You know her?

787
01:24:34,786 --> 01:24:38,153
She lives there!

788
01:24:40,258 --> 01:24:42,590
Can you take me to her?

789
01:24:42,794 --> 01:24:45,285
Come on, let's go.

790
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:52,231
We should have handed over the
bastard to that mob.

791
01:24:56,541 --> 01:24:59,840
But you seemed more interested
in singing with him instead!

792
01:25:02,781 --> 01:25:04,214
He still had a gun on him.

793
01:25:04,649 --> 01:25:06,947
He could have easily taken down
10 to 15 of those villagers.

794
01:25:12,991 --> 01:25:13,923
What's going on here?

795
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:16,355
The two Taliban were escaping.
We caught hold of them.

796
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:22,525
Is he one of them?

797
01:25:23,968 --> 01:25:26,994
Have a look at the other one!
- No, none of them is the guy.

798
01:25:28,139 --> 01:25:31,074
Have you seen an American lady
with 4 men drive past?

799
01:25:31,276 --> 01:25:32,800
Yes! -Which direction?

800
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:36,879
They've gone towards Torkham
- Torkham? Let's rush!

801
01:26:25,029 --> 01:26:28,590
I can't believe even these bastards
have daughters!

802
01:28:01,793 --> 01:28:03,590
Why didn't you speak to your daughter?

803
01:28:07,031 --> 01:28:11,491
You guys are fortunate...

804
01:28:13,171 --> 01:28:15,264
...you belong to a different world.

805
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,336
You will never understand...

806
01:28:23,948 --> 01:28:25,074
Imran Sahab...

807
01:28:27,819 --> 01:28:29,184
...deep down you are not such a bad guy...

808
01:28:30,588 --> 01:28:32,283
Yes...

809
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:35,022
And maybe if you weren't a Talib...

810
01:28:35,226 --> 01:28:37,820
...we might have even been friends...

811
01:28:41,299 --> 01:28:43,267
Yes... like you guys say in India...

812
01:28:44,969 --> 01:28:46,334
In another lifetime, perhaps...

813
01:29:04,889 --> 01:29:08,052
Where are you running? Stop!

814
01:29:47,832 --> 01:29:49,697
This firing seems to be happening nearby.

815
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:55,467
When did it start?
- A little while ago...

816
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:59,272
Okay. Stay alert!

817
01:30:07,919 --> 01:30:08,943
Commander! - Yes!

818
01:30:09,153 --> 01:30:12,953
A Talib has taken two Indian journalists
behind those rocks!

819
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:15,455
We'll get them back. Guys, let's go!

820
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:32,169
Indian journalists...! This bloody car!

821
01:30:32,443 --> 01:30:34,138
What are you doing?

822
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:36,974
Tell him now!

823
01:30:37,748 --> 01:30:38,908
Listen!

824
01:30:40,251 --> 01:30:44,745
This is the local Mujahidin commander.

825
01:30:46,090 --> 01:30:52,393
If you hand the Indian journalists over,
he will let you go.

826
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:58,091
Let them go, you bastard!

827
01:31:00,605 --> 01:31:02,869
The border is 5 minutes away.

828
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:07,269
I'm too close now to give up.

829
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:11,441
Either I cross the border, or all of us die.

830
01:31:14,819 --> 01:31:16,286
Listen here...

831
01:31:17,688 --> 01:31:21,180
...If you and your men...
don't leave this area in 5 minutes...

832
01:31:21,392 --> 01:31:25,419
I'm going to shoot these guys one by one...

833
01:31:41,312 --> 01:31:42,973
Don't be stupid, Imran Sahab.

834
01:31:43,514 --> 01:31:46,483
If you leave us, the commander will let you go.

835
01:31:47,418 --> 01:31:52,253
You really believe that these
Afghans will let me live?

836
01:31:52,456 --> 01:31:54,549
Me? A Talib!

837
01:31:56,861 --> 01:31:58,328
But you're not like the Taliban.

838
01:31:58,963 --> 01:32:01,397
Really...? And you will explain this to them?

839
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:04,159
Have you forgotten what they did
to those two guys in the village?

840
01:32:05,536 --> 01:32:07,561
Do you think my fate will be
any better than that?

841
01:32:17,448 --> 01:32:21,578
Don't fire like that!
Didn't he say he'll shoot them if you fire?

842
01:32:24,188 --> 01:32:28,249
But then it's impossible for you
to escape from here.

843
01:32:34,732 --> 01:32:37,496
Bastard!

844
01:33:00,191 --> 01:33:01,123
Is that the last magazine?

845
01:33:10,268 --> 01:33:11,997
Why don't you leave us and run away?

846
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:18,902
If I stop firing these guys will be here
in less than a minute.

847
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:21,704
And it will take me at least
10 minutes to reach that hill.

848
01:33:33,291 --> 01:33:36,124
Imran Sahab, give me your gun.

849
01:33:40,998 --> 01:33:42,898
Give me the gun and run to your country
as fast as you can.

850
01:33:43,367 --> 01:33:47,599
I will keep firing in the air towards them
for the next 10 minutes.

851
01:33:48,005 --> 01:33:49,302
They won't move ahead.

852
01:33:50,808 --> 01:33:52,605
If I hand you the gun...

853
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:57,279
...won't you shoot me?

854
01:33:59,216 --> 01:34:02,481
You have no option but to trust me.

855
01:34:03,921 --> 01:34:06,890
If you stay, you will surely die.

856
01:34:08,392 --> 01:34:12,123
But if you give me the gun,
you might just have a chance.

857
01:34:27,278 --> 01:34:29,303
Hey! Go from behind.

858
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:12,350
Just a moment Mr. Taliban.

859
01:35:13,557 --> 01:35:15,684
Here's a little gift from India?

860
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:29,004
Don't smoke any other cigarette...
you might get a sore throat.

861
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:43,545
You have helped me reach home...

862
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:45,717
...but you guys also need to go back, don't you?

863
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:12,141
Why's he firing in the air?

864
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:13,847
Can I, please?

865
01:36:32,169 --> 01:36:33,966
Is this enough? - This is enough.

866
01:36:34,505 --> 01:36:35,802
He must have reached Lahore by now.

867
01:36:44,482 --> 01:36:46,643
Commander! The Talib is not here!

868
01:37:36,567 --> 01:37:38,501
Why is this chap running straight towards us?

869
01:37:39,169 --> 01:37:40,431
Sir, he could be one of our men!

870
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:41,567
How often do I need to repeat myself?

871
01:37:42,406 --> 01:37:46,069
None of our men are on that side of the border!

872
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:57,077
He's seems to be headed here.
Give him a warning shot! - Sir?

873
01:37:57,321 --> 01:37:58,049
Fire...

874
01:38:24,582 --> 01:38:25,571
What the hell is he saying?

875
01:38:26,817 --> 01:38:29,047
I think he's trying to tell us something...

876
01:38:29,453 --> 01:38:33,446
I'm Subedar Major Jaan Mohammed...
Frontier Guards...

877
01:38:34,224 --> 01:38:35,316
Should we allow him near the post?

878
01:38:35,893 --> 01:38:38,760
No need. Fire another warning shot!

879
01:38:39,530 --> 01:38:43,193
Sir, he is unarmed! - Fire!

880
01:38:48,038 --> 01:38:49,471
Why are you firing?

881
01:38:50,474 --> 01:38:52,840
Are you mad? Listen to me, please!

882
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:58,910
I'm... Subedar Major Jaan Mohammed...

883
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:06,813
I'm... Subedar Major Jaan Mohammed...

884
01:39:11,128 --> 01:39:12,117
He has come too close...

885
01:39:13,464 --> 01:39:16,262
If he tries to cross the water,
shoot him down!

886
01:39:16,567 --> 01:39:18,296
Sir, it seems he's one of us!

887
01:39:18,502 --> 01:39:21,062
Our men are not in Afghanistan...

888
01:39:21,538 --> 01:39:22,232
Fire!

889
01:40:25,636 --> 01:40:29,197
So this was the story of our Journey
with the enemy.

890
01:40:31,041 --> 01:40:33,236
But why was he the enemy?

891
01:40:35,312 --> 01:40:40,875
I mean, for 2 days we were just 5 guys
traveling together in Kabul Express.

892
01:40:42,519 --> 01:40:45,420
We all felt fear, we all felt anger.

893
01:40:46,657 --> 01:40:50,593
All of us enjoyed singing and
we all enjoyed cricket.

894
01:40:51,995 --> 01:40:53,895
Well... almost all.

895
01:40:55,099 --> 01:40:59,468
Our following days in Kabul were
not even remotely as exciting as...

896
01:40:59,703 --> 01:41:01,261
...the two days we spent with Imran.

897
01:41:01,805 --> 01:41:05,536
But in our report that we made for
television, we had to cut out...

898
01:41:05,743 --> 01:41:09,008
...most of what we had seen
And experienced with Imran.

899
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:14,777
After all Taliban is still the enemy
and how could we tell the...

900
01:41:14,985 --> 01:41:18,045
...audience that we almost
made friends with one?

901
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:20,816
I don't know what finally happened to Imran...

902
01:41:21,725 --> 01:41:27,891
...but I hope he reached home
and is happy wherever he is.

903
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:41,307
What?
