1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,170
The professional Mourner

2
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:12,315
Gifting a cow is a most beneficient act

3
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:22,452
It assures one salvation

4
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:30,090
Go. Take it away

5
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:32,062
You gifted a cow

6
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,327
You will attain heaven

7
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:37,599
And 11 Brahmins are to be fed at the temple

8
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:43,733
Why 11?
Would five lessen my accumulated virtue?

9
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:47,677
Get lost! You hind of a dirty buffalo!

10
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:52,083
As you command...

11
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,417
I've been put out of my own house...

12
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,489
And thrown here to rot under this pavilion!

13
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,684
May thieves take his accursed mother!

14
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:03,624
I know very well...

15
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:09,564
No one'll cry over my corpse
when I die tomorrow

16
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:12,157
"Father, you'll get perfectly well"

17
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:14,499
I sent for the city doctor.
He should be here soon

18
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:19,700
"Oh, your city doctor'll bring
the fabled Sanjivani..."

19
00:06:21,011 --> 00:06:23,103
...like some god!

20
00:06:23,212 --> 00:06:25,305
It's I who am paying for all your sins!

21
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:27,314
Where's that wretched Kalia gone!

22
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,974
"Hey, Kalia!"

23
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:32,052
"You hind of a buffalo! Yes, Hukum (liege)"

24
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:34,917
"Couldn't I call out from here, you fool"

25
00:06:35,023 --> 00:06:38,583
Go there and call him

26
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:42,924
Even this wretched death
doesn't come too soon!

27
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:47,258
"Kalia... Hey, Kalia... come quickly"

28
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,197
He's making merry

29
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:54,328
"His life isn't hanging by a thread, is it!"

30
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,272
"Were you dead, you wretch!"

31
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,276
You stuck to me like a shadow
when I was alive

32
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:04,142
"And now, you vanish out of sight!"

33
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:07,217
"I'm but your dog, sir. Where'll I go"

34
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:10,149
"May God give you long life. Command me, sir"

35
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:13,416
Come here...

36
00:07:13,523 --> 00:07:15,683
Sit here by my side

37
00:07:17,392 --> 00:07:21,886
"Look, I don't think
I'll ever get up from my bed"

38
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:25,363
That Pandit may say anything

39
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:27,024
He just babbles

40
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:31,433
"Clutching a calf"s tail,
I had invited the god of death"

41
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:34,507
But even he hasn't come

42
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:36,836
I won't die so easily...

43
00:07:36,942 --> 00:07:40,173
...because the god of death
has no time for me

44
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,304
And you'll also see...

45
00:07:42,414 --> 00:07:46,373
"I gasp out my breath,
and they'll distribute sweets!"

46
00:07:46,484 --> 00:07:48,645
God forbid!

47
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,515
The young Master is most worried about you

48
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,249
"Very worried, I'm sure!"

49
00:07:53,357 --> 00:07:54,653
Just you wait and see...

50
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:59,661
He'll not shed a drop of a tear when I'm dead

51
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:06,124
"You sent for me, Hukum (liege)?"

52
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,861
Will you cry when I die?

53
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:11,335
"How can you say such a thing, Hukum!"

54
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:12,599
Tell me why you called me...

55
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:16,403
"Oh, yes... As I was saying...
You too won't cry"

56
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:20,536
Fetch a Rudali (Professional mourner)
From the village...

57
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:24,410
...a special one who leads
the mourning in rich houses

58
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:26,883
"Now, don't fetch an expensive one..."

59
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:29,078
Get someone cheaper

60
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:33,687
"At least, she'll cry over my death"

61
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:38,627
She'll mourn... even she's hired for it...
But she'll cry

62
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,957
"Well, you heard me"

63
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:44,363
Go now. Why're you still sitting here!?

64
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:47,025
"Hey, Munim (Accountant)...! Hukum?"

65
00:08:47,137 --> 00:08:48,832
Will you cry when I die?

66
00:08:48,938 --> 00:08:51,633
I feel like crying now!

67
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:54,903
No... Your wretched face always look weepy!

68
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:10,121
I won't be a burden on you

69
00:09:10,223 --> 00:09:13,715
I'll help cook and clean.
And bring vegetables

70
00:09:14,093 --> 00:09:18,325
I mourned at a wake before coming here.
I've money

71
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:23,394
May be...
I'll have to stay here with you for a while

72
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:28,197
Can't trust the Zamindar to die soon

73
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:32,672
Even life is a matter of chance...

74
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:37,007
Who can say what happens after death...!

75
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,490
May I ask you something?

76
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,493
Who gave you this name
Shanichari (Saturnine)?

77
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:05,169
Shanichari...
The folks here started calling me that...

78
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,431
Unlucky to be born on Saturday...

79
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,700
Accursed because...

80
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:13,370
she ate up her father
as soon as she was born!

81
00:10:24,554 --> 00:10:26,988
Didn't your Ma give you a name?

82
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,051
When did I ever see my Ma's face...!

83
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:35,455
She ran away after I was born...

84
00:10:35,563 --> 00:10:40,125
...with some actor from a touring company

85
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:44,263
It's said she was a born wanderer

86
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,399
You think it'll rain?

87
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,273
I grew up... I was fair and pretty

88
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:59,677
A drunk won me in a game...
and brought me to this place

89
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:02,353
He married me...

90
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:07,480
And ever since...
this has been my heaven and hell

91
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:13,822
Where have you come from?

92
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:17,162
From Dongri...

93
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:20,366
Those who're dying send for me

94
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:21,299
"I'm a Rudali (professional mourner),
you know..."

95
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:26,170
Here today and elsewhere tomorrow

96
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:37,978
Looks like it'll rain

97
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:25,219
You don't seem to belong here...

98
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:29,156
...but come from elsewhere

99
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,628
Sometimes I wonder if you're really mine!

100
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:39,227
You're born to a wanderer like my mother

101
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:45,902
I forgot!
I've to take home medicine for Dadi (Grandma)

102
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,477
"Let's stay for a while, Ma"

103
00:12:47,545 --> 00:12:51,571
"We've been here for so long.
We'll come again, Budhua"

104
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:53,114
"Dance, Ma!"

105
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:54,514
Are you crazy!? Please dance

106
00:12:54,616 --> 00:12:56,380
"Oh, I'll fall off! Dance, Ma"

107
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:59,181
"You've got used to play-acting,
heven't you!"

108
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:01,119
"Should your Dadi know, she'll hit me"

109
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:02,281
Please dance

110
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:05,986
"You'll come home if I dance? Yes, I will"

111
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:21,203
"Oh well, I'm dancing with my son!"

112
00:13:21,308 --> 00:13:23,673
"What happened, Ma?"

113
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:31,015
"I fell down, you crazy boy! Let's go..."

114
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:35,883
"Oh, it looks like it's going to rain"

115
00:13:37,454 --> 00:13:41,151
She'll rain abuses... as she does everyday

116
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:44,351
"So you're home, you witch! Yes"

117
00:13:44,427 --> 00:13:47,362
Did you bring my medicine? Yes

118
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:50,361
She won't even let me breathe...

119
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:54,629
What happened? Who broke this pot?

120
00:13:57,872 --> 00:13:59,100
I did.

121
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,567
What could I do...! I was dying of thirst

122
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,845
"Was anyone at home to give me water,
tell me!"

123
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,914
I had to get up myself... And I fell down

124
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:16,511
But what am I to do?
Tell your son to sit beside you

125
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,851
Then who'll work in the Zamindar's fields!?

126
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:22,857
It's I who slog and slave!
Does he do anything!

127
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,484
He'll be lying drunk...

128
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:28,521
Then I go searching...
at the temple and the liquor den...

129
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:33,797
Oh! And here he practically stood by my side
for a week!

130
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:39,535
Well do I know!
You'll be at peace only when I die!

131
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:43,270
"Forever maligning my son, are you!
You accursed!"

132
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:47,610
The Zamindar's men will whip him one day

133
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:49,172
He'll know then!

134
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,241
May the worms eat your tongue!

135
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:54,549
"You always speak evil,
you black-tongued bitch!"

136
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:55,747
That's why you're named...

137
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:57,653
"Yes, Shanichari!"

138
00:14:57,723 --> 00:15:02,820
Born on a Saturday
to eat up her father at her birth...

139
00:15:02,895 --> 00:15:04,361
"Accursed wretch, I know!"

140
00:15:04,463 --> 00:15:07,955
Let Ganju come home.
See if I don't have him skin you!

141
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:11,501
"Budhua, come and eat your bread."

142
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:13,969
Still picking your nose?

143
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,438
"Coming, Ma"

144
00:15:16,507 --> 00:15:20,967
What did the Vaid (herbal doctor) say?

145
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:23,511
He gave medicine. I'll give you

146
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:26,309
Will the medicine make grandma all right?

147
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,644
God forbid...

148
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,651
The clouds're really thundering tonight

149
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,178
"Yes, they only thunder. When will it rain"

150
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:50,795
The fever's still high... hasn't come down

151
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:53,167
When'll Ganju come home...

152
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:57,140
It's two days since I saw his face...

153
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,609
"Why do you worry? Now, sleep well"

154
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:05,741
I'll go search for him in the evening
...Don't worry

155
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,356
Ganju...!

156
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:20,087
"Have you seen Ganju? - No, I haven't"

157
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,497
Oh God! Where'll I search for
this drunken sot!

158
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,625
Ganju...!

159
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:35,641
Tanne Singh...

160
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,504
Tanne Singh...

161
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:41,174
You saw Budhua's father anywhere?

162
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:43,145
Ganju? He was here the past 2 days

163
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:45,116
Must've run away in fear this morning

164
00:16:45,185 --> 00:16:45,843
"You're lying! - No, it's the truth"

165
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:50,854
There was a theft at the Zamindar's.
They suspect him

166
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:54,391
His Ma is so ill and there's no news of him

167
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,051
Send him home if he comes

168
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:59,119
And you send him too

169
00:19:18,684 --> 00:19:22,381
"Ma, come and see!"

170
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:25,980
It's raining so heavily after years...

171
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,787
This barren earth is soaked!
I danced like one possessed

172
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:31,258
Look at my clothes!

173
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:37,266
They cling as if they don't want to
leave my skin

174
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:41,261
"Look, Ma... Ma, look..."

175
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:39,946
Ganju...!

176
00:20:44,758 --> 00:20:47,317
"Panditji, did you see my husband?"

177
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:49,885
He's not come home for 2 days. What happened?

178
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:52,954
My mother-in-law... I'm searching for him

179
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:56,194
"Well, keep searching!
He won't be home for 6 months"

180
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:59,794
He's in a police lock up.
He stole from the Zamindar.

181
00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:04,740
"Go, you accursed wretch! ...God forbid..."

182
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:09,973
Kamli... Chanchali...

183
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:14,484
Kamli...! Shanichari?

184
00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:16,609
My Ma-in-law is dead

185
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:18,152
This time of the night!

186
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,280
It's a sin to keep the body overnight.
I must cremate her

187
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:25,485
"If the Pandit comes to know,
he'll make me spend 1O rupees"

188
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,723
There isn't a grain to eat but folks'll
be ready to say...

189
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:32,959
...perform all sorts of rites! Come quickly

190
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:19,037
I didn't cry...

191
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:22,340
Not a tear would moisten my eyes...

192
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:28,403
Even time was against me

193
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:35,012
"Oh, don't you have to go there?"

194
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:38,351
I will go... after a while

195
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:41,625
"He isn't going to die this night, is he"

196
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,660
And if he had died...

197
00:22:43,727 --> 00:22:47,686
You'd have seen vultures circling in the sky

198
00:22:55,805 --> 00:22:57,772
"Beg pardon, my liege"

199
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:06,444
Bhikni...

200
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:10,374
"There's no lack of food at Shanichari's,
I hope"

201
00:23:10,484 --> 00:23:13,647
"No, Hukum. I have everything there"

202
00:23:13,754 --> 00:23:16,244
"Shanichari is well, I hope?"

203
00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:18,916
"Yes, Hukum"

204
00:23:19,025 --> 00:23:26,931
Tell her to come here to the palace
if she needs anything

205
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,794
Tell her to meet me

206
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,496
She's an old retainer of the palace

207
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:37,062
"Yes, Hukum"

208
00:23:49,118 --> 00:23:52,951
"Hey, Shanichari...!"

209
00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:57,955
Look at all the things
I have brought for you!

210
00:23:59,993 --> 00:24:03,792
That mean old Munim really got
what he deserved today!

211
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:08,026
"Here, come and see... one kilo lentils..."

212
00:24:08,134 --> 00:24:11,034
One kilo rice and... then this oil

213
00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:12,900
And 25 rupees cash!

214
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:16,835
We'll make merry now

215
00:24:16,942 --> 00:24:23,176
How did you like... the palace?

216
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,110
The palace was nice...

217
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:34,519
And so was the owner of the palace!

218
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:37,319
He was not much bothered about me...

219
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:40,384
It was you he was worried about!

220
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:44,522
Was there some special attachment...
in your youth?

221
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:47,931
"Come on, tell me"

222
00:24:48,102 --> 00:24:54,199
That smile seems to hover round your lips!
Why?

223
00:24:54,374 --> 00:25:00,539
Look up! Look up when you speak

224
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,420
"Come on, girl.
Let me have some water to drink"

225
00:26:53,877 --> 00:26:57,244
Have you gone crazy!?

226
00:26:57,414 --> 00:26:59,847
Who're you giving water to?

227
00:26:59,949 --> 00:27:02,918
You said... give water.
So I'm giving some water

228
00:27:02,985 --> 00:27:07,114
"I said, give me water.
It's I who am thirsty"

229
00:27:07,222 --> 00:27:08,884
And you give the camel the water!

230
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:12,585
How can I give you water!
I'll have to raise my head

231
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:16,857
Why? Have you sprained your neck?

232
00:27:17,031 --> 00:27:19,056
Yes... look up

233
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:22,335
"Look up, you silly girl"

234
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:25,461
"Look up, I said"

235
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:43,019
Such piercing eyes! ...I find you beautiful

236
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,688
What's your name? Shanichari

237
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,088
Where're you going? Home

238
00:27:49,192 --> 00:27:52,683
Listen... I didn't stop just to look at you

239
00:27:52,795 --> 00:27:54,820
I was thirsty

240
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:59,628
I saw the pot on your head.
Thought you'd give me water

241
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:02,292
My flagon is empty

242
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,632
Your flagon's empty...!

243
00:28:03,738 --> 00:28:05,227
"Yes, give me water"

244
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:08,434
Don't you understand! Lt'll pollute your caste

245
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:10,305
It won't harm me to drink water

246
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:17,713
"If it harms you to give me water,
well then... don't!"

247
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:24,985
"Enough, Hukum?"

248
00:28:25,824 --> 00:28:27,985
"Yes, enough... for now"

249
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:32,791
I'll take you there. Where have you to go?

250
00:28:32,897 --> 00:28:36,264
Barna. Then get on the camel

251
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:38,266
You add glory to the camel

252
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:40,528
You're born to ride the camel

253
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,696
I'll sit forward and you sit behind me

254
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:47,138
"This glory you spoke of will lead...
so, come on"

255
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:50,802
I'll be buried alive
should anyone in the village see me

256
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:52,743
Don't you worry

257
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,078
So long as this Lakshman Singh is alive...

258
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:58,606
No one'll even dare raise his eyes at you!

259
00:28:58,685 --> 00:29:02,018
"Beg your ardon, Hukum!"

260
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:03,077
What's the matter?

261
00:29:03,156 --> 00:29:05,817
"Forgive me, Hukum!"

262
00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:08,485
"Listen to me, will you"

263
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:12,625
Why've you tied me up and brought me here?

264
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:13,630
What've I done!

265
00:29:13,699 --> 00:29:16,633
How do I know! Hukum told me to bring you

266
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:24,640
Come on... Walk

267
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:33,304
"Hukum, he is Ganju. Shanichari's husband"

268
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:42,990
Is Ganju your name?

269
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,116
"Forgive me, Hukum! I beg your pardon"

270
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:49,728
"I've done nothing wrong, Hukum"

271
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,129
"I was working and Kalia brought me here,
all tied up"

272
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:55,793
He beat me up... really thrashed me

273
00:29:55,902 --> 00:29:59,929
Hmm... Have you had liquor?

274
00:30:00,106 --> 00:30:03,268
"No, Hukum. I... I...
I haven't had any liquor"

275
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:07,209
"I swear on my son.
I've given up drink, Hukum!"

276
00:30:07,312 --> 00:30:10,474
I can smell liquor on you!

277
00:30:10,581 --> 00:30:11,808
I... my joints were aching last night

278
00:30:11,915 --> 00:30:15,351
"And I massaged it, Hukum... And then..."

279
00:30:15,452 --> 00:30:17,750
"I... I just took one little gulp,
that's all"

280
00:30:17,854 --> 00:30:23,485
Kalia didn't let me bathe.
That's why there's the smell

281
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:24,821
What's your daily wage?

282
00:30:24,927 --> 00:30:27,157
2 rupees and 8 annas

283
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,558
You drink away the 2 rupees
and give the 8 anna at home

284
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:35,227
"No, Hukum!
You've got it totally upside down!"

285
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:38,827
I give 8 annas at home and

286
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:53,783
The young Malkin (mistress)
Of the palace needs a maid

287
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:59,990
She'll get food and clothes. Send your wife

288
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,854
She won't even need your 8 annas then

289
00:31:23,377 --> 00:31:26,676
I'm Moti. Malkin (mistress)
Has been waiting so long

290
00:31:26,747 --> 00:31:29,544
Come... walk quickly

291
00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:34,815
My heart is humming! Humming?

292
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:37,946
It beats so hard! I'm afraid

293
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:41,549
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Malkin is very kind

294
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,062
That's the way it is with
high born landed Thakurs

295
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,690
"If you ask, you get everything"

296
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,289
But if you don't ask...

297
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,496
She'll not let you touch
even the twig of a tree

298
00:31:54,604 --> 00:31:57,231
And don't you even dare go near the temple

299
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:02,642
lt'll be a calamity
if you touch the image of any god

300
00:32:02,745 --> 00:32:06,771
I'll have a slim waist
if I go up these stairs daily!

301
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:10,908
Did my waist get slim that yours should!
...Come on

302
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,850
"May I enter, Malkin? Come in"

303
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:21,324
Shanichari is here. Who Shanichari?

304
00:32:21,394 --> 00:32:23,828
You had sent for a maid

305
00:32:23,896 --> 00:32:25,022
A maid? For what?

306
00:32:25,098 --> 00:32:27,157
Kunwar Sahib told you about her

307
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:30,669
Shall I send her in?

308
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,670
All right. Send her in. Come

309
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:45,940
"Oh, Moti..."

310
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:51,084
Do they use so much water everyday to bathe?

311
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:53,950
The good fortune of the big folk!

312
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,683
Silly girl! What do they lack?

313
00:32:56,791 --> 00:33:00,283
They have wells and ponds of their own!

314
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:05,697
Poor Budhua!
He must be fetching water himself now...

315
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,959
Be quick now

316
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:09,501
May I just wash my face and hands?

317
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,160
Just a little... Quickly

318
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:22,707
"Hey, Moti... Yes"

319
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:27,717
Tell me this.
You're like us but why do you live with them

320
00:33:27,818 --> 00:33:30,287
Why not live with us

321
00:33:30,355 --> 00:33:34,120
I came here a long time ago.
I was even younger than you

322
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:37,193
I came to serve the elder Malkin

323
00:33:37,294 --> 00:33:39,454
I couldn't bear hunger and poverty...

324
00:33:39,562 --> 00:33:44,999
So what else could I do... I stayed here

325
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,294
Now I'm old

326
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:49,302
Who needs this old bag of bones...!

327
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,135
Yes. What you say is true

328
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,935
Once a woman comes to live here...

329
00:33:55,042 --> 00:33:57,670
Folks don't think well of her

330
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:16,225
"Hey, Shanichari... Yes"

331
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:18,420
We used to play hopscotch as children

332
00:34:18,529 --> 00:34:21,554
Tell me...
what game did you play as a child?

333
00:34:21,665 --> 00:34:23,292
"When did we ever play, Malkin!"

334
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:25,493
Fetched water when it was time to play...

335
00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:27,832
...and worked in fields otherwise

336
00:34:27,937 --> 00:34:31,373
Grandma used to pack me off with bread
and an onion

337
00:34:31,474 --> 00:34:35,170
"And she'd say,
drink water before and after eating..."

338
00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:38,177
That way the belly would feel full!

339
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:42,648
You talk of poverty
when I asked you about playing

340
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,240
But one game we did play... What?

341
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:47,445
We'd hide under the Zamindar's buffaloes...

342
00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:50,384
And suck milk straight from the udder!

343
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:52,458
From our herd?

344
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:53,855
I'm not from this village

345
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,520
I was born in Jasod
on a Saturday and at birth...

346
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:58,062
Kantha Rani...

347
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,924
Go... tell him I'm bathing

348
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,399
And ask him what he wants

349
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:04,867
"Yes, Malkin"

350
00:35:22,385 --> 00:35:24,682
Malkin (mistress) is bathing

351
00:35:24,786 --> 00:35:26,548
"Whenever I meet you, you're drenched"

352
00:35:27,388 --> 00:35:28,754
She asks if you want anything

353
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:29,680
Up...!

354
00:35:31,926 --> 00:35:33,290
Look at me when you speak

355
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,619
You want anything...

356
00:37:46,043 --> 00:37:49,534
Look up! Look up at me

357
00:37:51,046 --> 00:37:53,276
You're breathing fast

358
00:37:53,382 --> 00:37:57,477
"No, Hukum! NO! This is sin, <_Hukum!!"

359
00:37:57,551 --> 00:37:59,952
You poor innocent...

360
00:38:00,055 --> 00:38:03,955
From the day I saw you...

361
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:06,492
I have wanted you

362
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,220
I find you lovely

363
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,824
Hukum! Please give me my Chunni
(Shawl like cloth)

364
00:38:17,802 --> 00:38:18,963
If I don't?

365
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:24,230
"I'm not Moti, Hukum"

366
00:38:25,008 --> 00:38:27,910
Shanichari!!

367
00:38:29,546 --> 00:38:34,040
It's not difficult for a Zamindar
to abduct women

368
00:38:34,151 --> 00:38:38,588
But this Lakshman Singh is not Ramavtar

369
00:38:38,689 --> 00:38:40,849
But you're a Zamindar

370
00:38:41,557 --> 00:38:42,853
I'm a low-caste...

371
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:51,189
"Hukum, lt'll be a sin even
if my shadow falls on you!"

372
00:38:51,365 --> 00:38:54,198
I'll go to hell!

373
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:56,565
Sin... hell...

374
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:01,473
Do you know what sin is?

375
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:03,932
Virtue and sin...

376
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:09,480
They're but false myths
created by Brahmin logic

377
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:17,146
If one were to strictly follow
their teaching...

378
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:18,221
There wouldn't be a bigger sinner than I

379
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:24,689
If this life that
I'm living is one of sin...

380
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:29,628
"Well, what's wrong in that?"

381
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:36,637
"It's much cleaner than your virtuous life,
Shanichari!"

382
00:39:36,738 --> 00:39:38,229
You keep rotting in that filth...

383
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:41,502
"Hungry, naked and diseased..."

384
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:45,442
And assume you're accumulating viture?

385
00:39:45,545 --> 00:39:48,639
What sort of virtue? And for whom?

386
00:39:48,749 --> 00:39:51,445
Have you ever thought of it?

387
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:55,179
Your hell is... where you are!

388
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:12,530
Shanichari...

389
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,671
Think again

390
00:40:16,972 --> 00:40:19,737
I make you this promise

391
00:40:19,842 --> 00:40:23,676
You'll never go hungry or thirsty again

392
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,475
You'll have nothing but good in store

393
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:29,140
But yes. There's one thing

394
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,480
You must give up Budhua and Ganju

395
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:21,388
"Rani, Shanichari serves you most diligently"

396
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:23,656
Serve me sometimes!

397
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,392
"Yours to command, Hukum"

398
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,990
"Well, let it pass"

399
00:41:29,168 --> 00:41:33,866
Each one to his lot...!

400
00:41:37,176 --> 00:41:39,871
Kesar Bai is in Sipla these days

401
00:41:39,978 --> 00:41:41,171
I thought we could call her here...

402
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:46,547
For the baby's birthday. She sings very well

403
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:50,017
"There'll be singing, Rani. One even better!"

404
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,021
But there's no need for Kesar Bai

405
00:41:54,123 --> 00:41:58,957
This Shanichari here... She will sing

406
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:01,154
Kalia told me you've a lovely voice

407
00:42:02,464 --> 00:42:04,694
"How can I, Hukum?"

408
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,570
"You know better what and how to sing,
not I!"

409
00:42:12,672 --> 00:42:14,765
What I meant was...

410
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:18,106
If my shadow falls on the little Thakur...

411
00:42:18,211 --> 00:42:21,771
...on such an auspicious occasion!

412
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:25,643
"Don't you bother about that, Shanichari"

413
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:30,847
"The celebration'll be at night.
And so, no shadows!"

414
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:37,722
"Look,
all this matter of high and low caste..."

415
00:42:37,828 --> 00:42:40,160
...of pollution through shadows...

416
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,666
I neither know about it nor believe in it

417
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:47,792
"Besides, you sing so well!"

418
00:42:47,903 --> 00:42:51,066
Don't you want to share our happiness?

419
00:42:52,507 --> 00:42:54,406
"That's not it, Hukum"

420
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:59,134
Whatever be the matter...

421
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:06,745
You had asked for my command
and this then is my command!

422
00:43:06,853 --> 00:43:08,753
...- Hukum...... -

423
00:46:37,502 --> 00:46:41,802
"Shanichari, what is your desire?"

424
00:46:41,906 --> 00:46:44,636
"Your grace, my liege"

425
00:46:45,642 --> 00:46:47,667
All right

426
00:46:47,978 --> 00:46:51,209
Your hut stands on our ancestral land...

427
00:46:51,315 --> 00:46:55,546
The two acres around it are yours as of today

428
00:47:19,272 --> 00:47:24,903
And that night... I got everything

429
00:47:25,077 --> 00:47:30,036
Kunwar Sahib really set me free

430
00:47:32,283 --> 00:47:35,774
But what I lost that night...

431
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,377
I have never forgotten

432
00:47:37,622 --> 00:47:40,317
You never met him after that night

433
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:48,263
"How well you understand, Bhikni!"

434
00:47:48,364 --> 00:47:51,128
"All these years,
no one even knew this Shanichari"

435
00:47:51,233 --> 00:47:54,998
"And in two days, you..."

436
00:47:55,303 --> 00:47:59,261
Bhikni...

437
00:47:59,773 --> 00:48:02,605
The Thakur Sahib is dying.
Come quickly. He calls you

438
00:48:02,775 --> 00:48:04,471
"Wait, I'll come"

439
00:48:04,645 --> 00:48:06,407
"At once? - Now, at once!"

440
00:48:07,513 --> 00:48:10,949
It's almost night.
Can't he wait till morning?

441
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,883
Are you mad!

442
00:48:13,985 --> 00:48:16,749
Does death look at the clock before it comes?

443
00:48:16,988 --> 00:48:21,356
"Hey, Bhikni! What're you doing? Quick!"

444
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,767
Panditji (priest)...

445
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,777
Give me the holy Ganga water...! Soon

446
00:48:44,879 --> 00:48:46,847
"Munimji, go bring the Ganga water"

447
00:48:47,148 --> 00:48:51,107
My Lord... Ganga water

448
00:48:51,352 --> 00:48:52,648
"It's coming, Hukum"

449
00:48:52,752 --> 00:48:56,313
You've made me sit here for four hours!

450
00:48:56,423 --> 00:49:00,722
Why did you send him to fetch me?

451
00:49:00,826 --> 00:49:05,456
The Thakur isn't going to die so soon...
Give me a light

452
00:49:08,032 --> 00:49:12,991
"Who can save a dying man,
you tell me, Bhikni"

453
00:49:13,971 --> 00:49:16,872
The city doctor you brought here...!

454
00:49:16,974 --> 00:49:23,276
"You've ruined my business, you have!"

455
00:49:26,915 --> 00:49:30,407
Shall I tell you something?

456
00:49:30,518 --> 00:49:36,150
It's a good thing
the Lord prolonged Thakur's life

457
00:49:36,591 --> 00:49:39,150
Shanichari is so good!

458
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,356
"She says, Shanichari
the one born on a Saturday..."

459
00:49:43,464 --> 00:49:45,556
...ate up her father at birth...

460
00:49:45,665 --> 00:49:50,967
"Shanichari the accursed,
withered, wretched, unlucky!"

461
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:14,804
It's the plague!!
The plague has spread!

462
00:58:03,412 --> 00:58:07,370
Why can't I cry!

463
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:12,179
Today I'll cry till my heart breaks

464
00:58:12,485 --> 00:58:19,117
"Cry! Shanichari, cry!"

465
00:58:19,191 --> 00:58:20,590
"Cry!! Shanichari, CRY!!"

466
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:28,198
"CRY! Shanichari, cry!!"

467
00:58:36,707 --> 00:58:38,402
You hear me...!

468
00:58:38,508 --> 00:58:42,877
Shanichari hasn't dried up. She can cry

469
00:58:42,946 --> 00:58:44,537
She'll cry for Ganju's death!

470
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:47,207
You wretched widow!

471
00:58:50,585 --> 00:58:53,213
Have your eyes ever turned moist!

472
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,414
It's 1O days since Ganju died

473
00:58:55,523 --> 00:58:58,685
"Shameless woman,
you haven't performed his funeral rites"

474
00:58:58,792 --> 00:59:01,283
You didn't do it for your Ma-in-law!

475
00:59:01,395 --> 00:59:04,830
Ganju was your husband.
Atleast perform his rites

476
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:08,560
I had made the ritual offer...
of sand and water

477
00:59:08,635 --> 00:59:09,431
"Yes, she did"

478
00:59:09,535 --> 00:59:12,833
God forbid!

479
00:59:12,938 --> 00:59:16,135
You made offerings of sand and water!?

480
00:59:16,208 --> 00:59:18,732
Your seven generations'll rot in hell...

481
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:20,835
...if you don't have me perform the rites!

482
00:59:20,946 --> 00:59:22,310
You'll be cursed!

483
00:59:22,413 --> 00:59:24,904
Ganju'll be damned to hell

484
00:59:25,016 --> 00:59:26,312
"No, Panditji! NO!"

485
00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:28,180
"Please, revoke your curse"

486
00:59:28,286 --> 00:59:30,845
What peace did my man find in this world

487
00:59:30,954 --> 00:59:33,445
"Atleast, may his soul rest in peace"

488
00:59:33,556 --> 00:59:35,046
Take back your curse!

489
00:59:35,158 --> 00:59:39,184
"Get lost, you witch!
Putting on a chaste act, are you!"

490
00:59:39,295 --> 00:59:40,592
It's all your doing

491
00:59:40,696 --> 00:59:44,461
"Nothing happened when he drank everyday,
you wretch"

492
00:59:44,565 --> 00:59:48,729
"The one day he has the temple
Prasad with you, he dies!"

493
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:51,929
All because of you. You accursed wretch!

494
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:53,870
No! What'd you order me?

495
00:59:53,974 --> 00:59:56,408
"My orders? Well then, listen"

496
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:00,276
I'll take 3O rupees
to perform the proper rituals

497
01:00:00,379 --> 01:00:02,074
Not a paisa less!

498
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:05,149
I'll take 5O for both
if you add your Ma-in-laws's rites

499
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:08,617
From where'll I get so much money!

500
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,950
"From wherever, Borrow it...
Or steal it..."

501
01:00:12,056 --> 01:00:14,616
Commit a dacoity... Or beg

502
01:00:14,725 --> 01:00:16,750
And listen!

503
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:18,622
Those two might yet be saved

504
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:22,425
But your soul will not find place
even in hell!

505
01:00:22,532 --> 01:00:26,559
Accursed wretch that you're

506
01:01:02,767 --> 01:01:04,461
"Munimji... Yes, Hukum"

507
01:01:04,568 --> 01:01:09,198
Oh damn! How often have I told you!
Don't let me see...

508
01:01:09,272 --> 01:01:12,867
...these beggarly faces
first thing in the morning!

509
01:01:12,943 --> 01:01:15,001
It ruins the entire day!

510
01:01:15,111 --> 01:01:17,738
"These people are here asking for a loan,
Hukum"

511
01:01:17,846 --> 01:01:19,815
"One wants 1O, another 2O..."

512
01:01:19,915 --> 01:01:23,213
And Shanichari wants a loan of 5O rupees!

513
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,351
Hmmm... loan

514
01:01:27,856 --> 01:01:31,291
You know what a loan means?

515
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:37,018
"Along with the money,
you've to pay interest!"

516
01:01:37,397 --> 01:01:41,561
"Can you pay it?
It sends you back to your Grandma, I bet."

517
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:43,429
Go now

518
01:01:43,535 --> 01:01:47,096
"I said go, didn't I? Get lost"

519
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:49,331
But Shanichari!
You're the owner of your own house

520
01:01:52,411 --> 01:01:55,846
"What'll you do with a loan, eh?"

521
01:01:55,945 --> 01:02:00,041
"Oh, you'll build a palace
over your hut, eh!"

522
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:05,312
"My liege,
my husband died and I must perform..."

523
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,252
...his funeral rites

524
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:10,985
Mohanlal Pundit says
it'll cost me 5O rupees

525
01:02:11,093 --> 01:02:17,121
"But Shanchari,
how'll you ever pay back 5O rupees?"

526
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:21,394
I'll pay back somehow. Just command me

527
01:02:21,501 --> 01:02:23,401
What use are you to me...!

528
01:02:23,634 --> 01:02:28,400
"If you've anything else, tell me"

529
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:35,073
"Hukum, she has the hut which
Kunwar Sahib had gifted her"

530
01:02:35,176 --> 01:02:40,876
"No! Hukum, no!
It's my home. I can't give it up!"

531
01:02:40,982 --> 01:02:43,074
Who else is at home?

532
01:02:43,183 --> 01:02:46,414
No one else... but this my boy. He's eight

533
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:49,488
Hmm... Munimji...

534
01:02:50,324 --> 01:02:54,817
Take them all as bonded labour for 15 years

535
01:02:54,928 --> 01:02:58,887
"I'll die, Hukum! 15 years is very long"

536
01:02:58,997 --> 01:03:02,433
"What'll I eat if I don't even get a wage,
Hukum!"

537
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:05,901
"You have a son, don't you"

538
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:09,098
He'll earn for you. Send him to me

539
01:03:09,206 --> 01:03:13,164
I'll put him on a job

540
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:05,919
Budhua... O Budhua...!

541
01:04:06,322 --> 01:04:09,485
"Where're you hiding, you rascal?"

542
01:04:10,259 --> 01:04:12,726
Have you seen Budhua? Yes

543
01:04:12,794 --> 01:04:15,092
Where is he? Over there

544
01:04:17,499 --> 01:04:22,562
Budhua...! I'll thrash him today!

545
01:04:24,071 --> 01:04:26,595
Let me just find him

546
01:04:30,643 --> 01:04:37,946
"You boys, tell me where he is. Truthfully"

547
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:52,457
"Oh Budhua! Playing pranks on me, are you!"

548
01:04:52,562 --> 01:05:01,594
Why do you tease your poor mother so!

549
01:05:02,038 --> 01:05:05,996
"Oh, let me go, Budhua!"

550
01:05:06,107 --> 01:05:10,168
"What're you doing, Budhua!"

551
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:12,939
You aren't a child anymore

552
01:05:13,013 --> 01:05:18,007
Have you no shame!

553
01:05:28,728 --> 01:05:34,632
Atleast tell me before you go

554
01:05:34,699 --> 01:05:41,900
"Oh Ma, forgive me. I said sorry, didn't l"

555
01:05:42,006 --> 01:05:45,372
"Don't play pranks, son. I worry over you"

556
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:47,966
You worry? - Whether you're alive or no

557
01:05:48,078 --> 01:05:50,545
"Okay, I won't go - Don't you play pranks"

558
01:05:50,612 --> 01:05:55,242
I'll go only when you tell me to go

559
01:05:55,350 --> 01:06:01,686
"Again...! - Oh no, no! I won't go"

560
01:06:01,789 --> 01:06:06,157
What're you doing! Put me down

561
01:06:06,259 --> 01:06:10,958
You've grown heavy in your old age!

562
01:06:12,298 --> 01:06:19,601
Who says it's expensive. Buy it.
Your wife'll be happy

563
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:27,978
"Ah, Shanichari! Come, Lala"

564
01:06:28,046 --> 01:06:30,946
"Show me your quilt. It's warm, I hope"

565
01:06:31,014 --> 01:06:35,110
Are you blind! Why should I show you?
See it yourself

566
01:06:35,219 --> 01:06:38,381
That's why I say give it to me too...

567
01:06:38,488 --> 01:06:40,888
It'll keep away my cold!

568
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:44,857
How about kerosene?
Sprinkle it on yourself and light it!

569
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,793
Lt'll keep away the cold for ever!

570
01:06:47,863 --> 01:06:50,330
"Get lost, you bitch!"

571
01:06:50,397 --> 01:06:53,594
It's demeaning to argue with
the likes of you!

572
01:06:53,667 --> 01:06:57,830
"Shanichari, send Budhua to the
Thakur's palace tomorrow"

573
01:06:57,904 --> 01:06:58,928
"Yes, sir"

574
01:06:59,005 --> 01:07:00,632
"What're you doing here, Ramji?"

575
01:07:00,707 --> 01:07:03,870
Preparing to ward off the winter

576
01:07:03,977 --> 01:07:07,639
"Wonderful!
You've chosen the best place for it, Ramji"

577
01:07:07,713 --> 01:07:09,340
"I must applaud you... well,
I must be going"

578
01:07:09,414 --> 01:07:14,283
We'll meet again. - Here!

579
01:07:14,386 --> 01:07:16,216
"Listen, Shanichari"

580
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,310
I've some bad news for you

581
01:07:18,421 --> 01:07:21,720
When did one ever expect
good news from you!

582
01:07:21,825 --> 01:07:25,658
"Look, Thakur Sahib's days are numbered"

583
01:07:25,728 --> 01:07:27,720
And Kunwar Sahib has decided...

584
01:07:27,831 --> 01:07:31,596
...to sack all workers
and sell off the property

585
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:37,137
And the lot of people like you'll be hell.
Know that?

586
01:07:37,305 --> 01:07:39,830
"What're you saying, Munimji!"

587
01:07:39,941 --> 01:07:43,671
Where will we go! What will we do?

588
01:07:43,744 --> 01:07:44,676
As you well know...

589
01:07:44,745 --> 01:07:48,909
She isn't fit for
the oldest profession in the world now

590
01:07:52,386 --> 01:07:55,980
"Ramji, what you said's worth a million!"

591
01:07:56,088 --> 01:07:58,112
You wretched widow!
Think of something soon...

592
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:00,181
Or you'll starve to death

593
01:08:00,258 --> 01:08:03,250
No one'll lend you even a paisa!

594
01:08:08,699 --> 01:08:12,065
Wonderful! How am I to blame

595
01:08:12,169 --> 01:08:17,162
The Master is seriously ill!
And you're least concerned

596
01:08:17,273 --> 01:08:19,639
You just fill your pockets

597
01:08:19,709 --> 01:08:22,472
You're so worried about me! Why?

598
01:08:22,578 --> 01:08:24,875
You sucked us dry for years!
And pilfered from the Master

599
01:08:24,946 --> 01:08:28,780
So you built a mansion
and filled your coffers

600
01:08:28,883 --> 01:08:32,011
"You think you're a Zamindar, a Thakur!"

601
01:08:32,653 --> 01:08:34,382
Whore! Take care what you say

602
01:08:34,488 --> 01:08:35,852
Whore...!

603
01:08:36,022 --> 01:08:39,583
How can I forget
you're neither a Zamindar...

604
01:08:39,693 --> 01:08:43,128
...nor a lowcaste like me!

605
01:08:43,229 --> 01:08:45,754
"You're a pimp, Munimji!"

606
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:48,129
A pimp whose only religion is
dishonesty...

607
01:08:48,234 --> 01:08:51,464
...who worships money!

608
01:08:51,637 --> 01:08:54,469
I know that we poor will die...

609
01:08:54,572 --> 01:08:57,039
...this Zamindari (feudalism) will end

610
01:08:57,107 --> 01:09:01,544
"But you the pimp will live! Yes,
you misbegotten bastard"

611
01:09:01,645 --> 01:09:03,407
"Shut up, you whore!"

612
01:09:03,512 --> 01:09:05,413
Your tongue grows insolent with age!

613
01:09:05,515 --> 01:09:08,074
Know who you're talking to?

614
01:09:08,184 --> 01:09:11,483
Take care what you say or
I'll cut your tongue out

615
01:09:11,554 --> 01:09:12,486
Please come away

616
01:09:12,588 --> 01:09:14,680
I'll boot her out in public!

617
01:09:14,789 --> 01:09:17,484
Let her be. She has become old

618
01:09:17,591 --> 01:09:23,086
"I said,
don't bandy words with the likes of these!"

619
01:10:01,563 --> 01:10:03,530
Budhua...!

620
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,391
Tell me this one thing

621
01:10:08,569 --> 01:10:21,537
Why do you run off
when you can't be without your Ma?

622
01:10:23,449 --> 01:10:28,215
"It's beyond my control, Ma"

623
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,880
Somebody sings across the dunes...

624
01:10:30,989 --> 01:10:34,617
"And calls me, Ma... So I have to go"

625
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:40,897
I can't understand anything you say

626
01:10:41,397 --> 01:10:45,231
Why do you come back then?

627
01:10:46,202 --> 01:10:48,897
"Because Ma, you call me from here!"

628
01:10:49,137 --> 01:10:53,096
And so I come back to you

629
01:10:54,343 --> 01:10:58,302
"You're crazy, that's why"

630
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:06,510
And yes... you're my son

631
01:11:18,297 --> 01:11:21,060
"Oh, Budhua, you're home...
Stop that playing!"

632
01:11:21,165 --> 01:11:25,261
Lift it up. Let's go to the market...
come here

633
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:29,397
You put me to work already! Get up

634
01:11:29,974 --> 01:11:33,033
"Take care, Budhua!"

635
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:34,940
I can't lift it!

636
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:38,275
Have someone else lift it for you. I can't

637
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:39,473
"Hey you, Budhua... Yes"

638
01:11:39,582 --> 01:11:43,018
Aren't you ashamed!
Do some work sometimes alteast

639
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:45,348
I won't call anyone else. Get up

640
01:11:45,453 --> 01:11:47,886
"Wait, wait! I'll call if you won't"

641
01:11:47,988 --> 01:11:50,958
I shall call...

642
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:06,633
"Is this some joke, Budhua?"

643
01:12:06,738 --> 01:12:09,104
"Get up - It's not a joke, Ma"

644
01:12:09,207 --> 01:12:13,575
Have you gone mad!
You want to make this a brothel!

645
01:12:13,677 --> 01:12:15,441
You didn't marry this whore!?

646
01:12:15,547 --> 01:12:17,537
Have I done anything without asking you?

647
01:12:17,615 --> 01:12:21,380
All right. Throw her out

648
01:12:21,484 --> 01:12:23,850
Throw her out! Out of this house!

649
01:12:23,953 --> 01:12:28,981
"Leave her, Ma! Listen, Ma!
- Throw her out!"

650
01:12:33,694 --> 01:12:37,994
"Sit down and please listen to me, Ma"

651
01:12:38,099 --> 01:12:40,192
Listen! Don't be angry. Please listen

652
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:43,827
"Budhua,
I'll listen to every word you've to say"

653
01:12:43,904 --> 01:12:46,532
Throw this whore out first!

654
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,404
We'll become outcastes should folks see her

655
01:12:49,509 --> 01:12:50,805
Don't you understand?

656
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:52,400
"When were we ever welcome here, Ma"

657
01:12:52,511 --> 01:12:56,607
Everyone knows that
I lie drunk all day at her place

658
01:12:56,715 --> 01:12:58,807
"And come home at night, to you"

659
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:01,750
"Because you pity me... yes, out of pity"

660
01:13:01,853 --> 01:13:03,878
"No, becuase I'm afraid of you..."

661
01:13:03,988 --> 01:13:07,754
...you'll come after me
and flay me before the world

662
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:10,918
"Ma, please listen to this
one thing I've to say"

663
01:13:11,028 --> 01:13:12,221
"Yes, I'm listening to you"

664
01:13:12,328 --> 01:13:16,697
"Please listen, Ma.
Why're you afraid of folks"

665
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,289
Let them bark like dogs

666
01:13:18,367 --> 01:13:20,493
You walk upright and ignore them

667
01:13:20,602 --> 01:13:23,093
Just listen to what your heart says

668
01:13:23,205 --> 01:13:24,638
Budhua... Yes?

669
01:13:24,739 --> 01:13:27,833
My heart says only one thing...
one thing...

670
01:13:27,943 --> 01:13:32,901
"Throw this whore out of the house, now!"

671
01:13:33,012 --> 01:13:35,504
Shall I throw both of them out?

672
01:13:35,616 --> 01:13:39,517
Both!? ...Who are they? ...the two?

673
01:13:39,619 --> 01:13:41,985
Your grandson too is in her womb

674
01:13:42,088 --> 01:13:43,520
She wanted to abort it

675
01:13:43,622 --> 01:13:45,317
"I said, don't be afraid.
Ma'll take you in"

676
01:13:45,424 --> 01:13:53,660
"You'll keep her here,
won't you, Ma! Please Ma"

677
01:13:53,764 --> 01:13:55,925
You persuade my beguiled heart

678
01:15:06,828 --> 01:15:09,261
"Look at the times we're living in, Lala!"

679
01:15:09,363 --> 01:15:12,058
Whores do business openly in the market!

680
01:15:12,132 --> 01:15:13,191
Yes

681
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:17,361
She sells quilts by day and at night...

682
01:15:17,437 --> 01:15:19,735
Something must be done

683
01:15:19,839 --> 01:15:20,601
"Well, Panditji..."

684
01:15:20,707 --> 01:15:25,404
"Earlier, Rajas and Zamindars
used to take care of them"

685
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:28,479
Rajas've lost their kingdoms
and Zamindars their fieldoms

686
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:30,946
We're now forced to fawn over labourers

687
01:15:31,049 --> 01:15:34,143
Who'll care for these whores now!

688
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:40,554
"Hmm... Just look at that wanton Mungri,
will you!"

689
01:15:40,657 --> 01:15:44,023
Isn't she juicy like a ripe mango!

690
01:15:44,126 --> 01:15:47,027
Just pluck and peel it!

691
01:15:47,129 --> 01:15:52,567
Why do you call her a Mango? Ever suck it?

692
01:15:52,668 --> 01:15:57,763
"So you too have lined up, have you, Panditji!"

693
01:15:57,938 --> 01:16:01,840
"Lalji, I want 8 annas worth salt,
sugar and a biscuit"

694
01:16:02,142 --> 01:16:04,041
And I want Mungri!

695
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:06,577
I don't see you in the whore-street now

696
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,237
Where've you set up?

697
01:16:08,348 --> 01:16:11,441
"Hey, softly...
What if my Ma-in-law sees!"

698
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:15,179
Whose Ma-in-law? Yours or mine?

699
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:17,910
Mine. See her over there?

700
01:16:20,825 --> 01:16:24,658
Shanichari is your Ma-in-law! From when?

701
01:16:25,229 --> 01:16:27,322
"I'm married to her son, you know"

702
01:16:27,431 --> 01:16:33,733
So don't you talk smutty to me!
I'm a married woman!

703
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:35,937
"Get lost, you bitch"

704
01:16:36,038 --> 01:16:38,336
The wretched widow has set up a brothel!

705
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:42,341
God forbid!
What immoral times have come to pass!

706
01:16:42,443 --> 01:16:46,812
I must ask the Thakur
to throw the mother and son out

707
01:16:46,914 --> 01:16:48,881
How dare this lowly wretch!

708
01:16:48,982 --> 01:16:52,146
She sneaks a whore into her house
as a daughter-in-law!

709
01:16:52,519 --> 01:16:55,488
Make another one like me
your daugher-in-law

710
01:16:55,589 --> 01:16:58,558
You can't reap more merit than
this in life!

711
01:16:58,659 --> 01:17:01,218
Your 7 generations'll go to heaven!

712
01:17:01,327 --> 01:17:04,888
Say this again and
I'll cut your tongue out!

713
01:17:04,997 --> 01:17:06,896
You'll have to touch me

714
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:09,159
And that's not written in your scriptures

715
01:17:09,234 --> 01:17:12,169
"Aren't I right, Lala?"

716
01:17:13,537 --> 01:17:16,370
Mungri! You go from here

717
01:17:16,473 --> 01:17:23,173
So tell me.
How much sugar and jaggery do you want!

718
01:17:23,813 --> 01:17:27,180
It's a good thing Budhua has come home

719
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:29,581
He's taken care of your old age!

720
01:17:29,685 --> 01:17:32,813
He has brought home an entire shop!

721
01:17:32,888 --> 01:17:34,616
Both'll be happy now...

722
01:17:34,689 --> 01:17:37,056
...you and your son as well

723
01:17:37,159 --> 01:17:39,922
"You take care of your shop, Lala"

724
01:17:40,027 --> 01:17:45,259
How can I! My heart's not in it!

725
01:17:45,365 --> 01:17:48,663
You've kept your goods hidden at home!

726
01:17:48,767 --> 01:17:50,463
I swear on your goods...

727
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:53,663
I'll turn over my entire shop to you
if you let me

728
01:17:53,772 --> 01:17:54,397
Lala...!

729
01:17:54,506 --> 01:17:55,802
Whore Madam!

730
01:17:55,907 --> 01:17:56,271
Let go!

731
01:17:56,374 --> 01:17:58,741
You damned whore...!

732
01:17:58,844 --> 01:18:02,142
You run a whore house
and show off outraged decency!

733
01:18:02,246 --> 01:18:03,611
Shut up!

734
01:18:03,715 --> 01:18:07,115
You've a wife at home and pant
and slaver after whores

735
01:18:07,184 --> 01:18:08,947
You sneak under their skirts!

736
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:12,418
When my son rescues her
and gives her a home and respect

737
01:18:12,522 --> 01:18:14,045
You can't bear it

738
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:18,253
"Whatever he did,
my son did it bravely like a man!"

739
01:18:18,327 --> 01:18:19,658
He didn't hide like ou

740
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:20,888
lmpotent bastards!

741
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:26,360
If I don't have you both mother and son...

742
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:27,957
...thrown out of the village...

743
01:18:28,068 --> 01:18:29,558
Don't call me Mohanlal!

744
01:18:34,073 --> 01:18:37,509
Stop it! Stop playing that!

745
01:18:38,077 --> 01:18:42,172
Didn't I tell you not to
send her to the market!

746
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,714
When do you ever listen or understand!

747
01:18:43,816 --> 01:18:44,782
What happened?

748
01:18:44,883 --> 01:18:46,976
"Ask her! Go on, ask her"

749
01:18:47,085 --> 01:18:50,680
She rubbed our nose in dirt!
The village spits on us

750
01:18:50,756 --> 01:18:52,518
She showed what she is!

751
01:18:52,623 --> 01:18:54,818
What happened? Tell me

752
01:18:54,891 --> 01:18:58,328
What'll she tell you!
Shame has cut her tongue out

753
01:18:58,428 --> 01:19:01,397
She sniffed like a bitch
round Lala and Pandit

754
01:19:01,498 --> 01:19:04,126
With tongue hanging out! Hers and theirs

755
01:19:04,234 --> 01:19:05,064
Ma...!

756
01:19:05,168 --> 01:19:08,603
A whore's always a whore!
With a harlot's ways

757
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:11,935
Harlot! Your Ma's a harlot!
If she says anything more...

758
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,234
Stop it! - You shut up!

759
01:19:14,308 --> 01:19:15,935
I'm a fornicating whore!

760
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:17,010
"Yes, you are!"

761
01:19:17,111 --> 01:19:21,069
She who slurps from every glass
can't be a chaste wife

762
01:19:21,248 --> 01:19:24,149
"You're the only chaste wife on this earth,
aren't you!"

763
01:19:24,251 --> 01:19:28,346
Stop it or I'll slap you!

764
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:32,657
Who're you calling bastard!
He looks a bastard to you?

765
01:19:32,725 --> 01:19:33,691
He looks a bastard...

766
01:19:33,792 --> 01:19:37,023
You whore!
If it weren't for my grandson in your womb...

767
01:19:37,128 --> 01:19:39,096
I'd boot you out!

768
01:19:39,197 --> 01:19:40,027
Come...

769
01:19:41,131 --> 01:19:42,360
Grandson...

770
01:19:42,934 --> 01:19:46,630
How do you know it's your grandson
in my whore's womb

771
01:19:54,609 --> 01:19:56,771
lmpotent bastard!

772
01:19:56,879 --> 01:20:01,110
Crawl back into your Ma's belly
and hide there!

773
01:21:15,413 --> 01:21:17,108
Budhua...!

774
01:21:35,498 --> 01:21:37,260
"Oh, where are you!"

775
01:21:41,036 --> 01:21:42,003
Budhua...!

776
01:21:44,972 --> 01:21:47,133
"Tuliram, did you see my Budhua anywhere?"

777
01:21:47,241 --> 01:21:49,141
Which Budhua?

778
01:21:56,516 --> 01:21:58,813
Where's Mungri? Inside

779
01:21:58,918 --> 01:22:02,081
Mungri... Mungri...
Budhua didn't come back

780
01:22:02,187 --> 01:22:06,351
Mungri! What's happend to her?

781
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:08,482
Mungri aborted her baby

782
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:37,840
Did you have to cut off your own flesh
for what I said!

783
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:44,379
You could've given it to me.
I'd have brought him up

784
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:46,856
But you were worried about your trade

785
01:22:48,494 --> 01:22:51,519
"He was your grandson, Ma"

786
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:23,136
"I lost my grandson... with it,
my blood line"

787
01:24:23,243 --> 01:24:27,736
And my Budhua did never come back

788
01:24:27,846 --> 01:24:31,612
He went off with some touring company...!

789
01:24:31,717 --> 01:24:35,675
Just as my mother had

790
01:24:35,787 --> 01:24:42,749
He inherited my mother's wandering ways

791
01:24:47,197 --> 01:24:49,426
What was your mother's name?

792
01:24:49,598 --> 01:24:54,626
Peewli... folks say that was her name

793
01:24:54,937 --> 01:25:00,704
No one was sad for me...
that my son had run away

794
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:02,367
But Ramavtar Singh was sad...

795
01:25:02,477 --> 01:25:06,435
...for losing his bonded labourer

796
01:25:08,549 --> 01:25:12,986
But I haven't been able to
decide till today...

797
01:25:13,086 --> 01:25:20,321
Was it for good or bad
that Budhua ran away...

798
01:25:21,026 --> 01:25:27,521
When I think of him...
I feel it was a good thing

799
01:25:27,631 --> 01:25:31,795
What was here for him anyway

800
01:25:31,902 --> 01:25:39,000
"He'd share my scraps and die slowly,
inch by inch"

801
01:25:39,109 --> 01:25:44,206
When I think about myself...
I feel what happened was bad

802
01:25:44,314 --> 01:25:49,079
Who'll gather the dust into
which I have mingled

803
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:52,014
"Bhikni... Hey, Bhikni"

804
01:25:56,123 --> 01:25:57,148
You are crying!

805
01:25:57,258 --> 01:26:00,693
No... I'm not crying

806
01:26:01,061 --> 01:26:07,021
You've fallen into the trap of attachment
for me...!

807
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,369
A Rudali cries only when
she's paid to mourn!

808
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:17,630
Cry for me when I die.
But you'll be paid nothing!

809
01:26:22,947 --> 01:26:28,850
Go fetch a comb. I'll comb your hair

810
01:26:29,419 --> 01:26:32,854
You wept on hearing my tale

811
01:26:32,955 --> 01:26:38,722
So much happened to me and yet
I did not cry!

812
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,522
What could I do? I hardly found the time

813
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:48,727
Now I have nothing but time

814
01:26:50,237 --> 01:26:53,399
The tears don't come

815
01:26:53,506 --> 01:26:57,738
Dried up Shanichari! Unfortunate Shanichari

816
01:26:57,844 --> 01:27:05,011
Born on Saturday
and ate up her father at birth!

817
01:27:11,522 --> 01:27:19,087
"Bhikni, I am afraid...
of this attachment for you"

818
01:27:22,932 --> 01:27:26,230
You too will go away

819
01:27:26,334 --> 01:27:29,895
I know...

820
01:27:30,004 --> 01:27:32,905
Whoever was bound to me...

821
01:27:33,007 --> 01:27:39,104
...either died or went away

822
01:27:39,346 --> 01:27:43,043
"Will you too go away?
...yes, go away..."

823
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:48,246
...after Ramavtar dies

824
01:27:48,354 --> 01:27:51,322
This too I shall bear

825
01:27:51,423 --> 01:27:56,520
I have that strength

826
01:27:56,628 --> 01:28:01,792
"And now, I have got used to it"

827
01:28:03,167 --> 01:28:06,932
But memories of you will keep coming...

828
01:28:07,036 --> 01:28:11,665
Will you stay for always...

829
01:28:11,773 --> 01:28:16,801
...here in this house?

830
01:28:18,247 --> 01:28:20,875
"Stay back, Bhikni..."

831
01:28:20,983 --> 01:28:27,820
"Yes, stay here with me"

832
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:49,840
"Bhikni! Hey, Bhikni"

833
01:28:52,342 --> 01:28:54,833
I looked all over and you're here!

834
01:28:54,945 --> 01:28:56,572
Is he dead?

835
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:59,773
Then why're you here?

836
01:29:01,284 --> 01:29:04,980
You don't know when he'll die.
Another job for you

837
01:29:05,086 --> 01:29:05,984
Will you mourn?

838
01:29:06,688 --> 01:29:11,057
That's what I do!
But a Rudali mourns after death

839
01:29:11,159 --> 01:29:12,648
It's unlucky otherwise

840
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:15,456
See how Ramavtar's life is stuck

841
01:29:17,298 --> 01:29:19,060
"Yes, I know. Where do I have to go?"

842
01:29:19,165 --> 01:29:21,827
To Nathuni Singh's house
in this very village

843
01:29:21,901 --> 01:29:24,665
He's Ramavtar's distant relation

844
01:29:24,771 --> 01:29:26,397
But they're estranged

845
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,667
Nathuni Singh died in the night

846
01:29:28,774 --> 01:29:33,336
I thought...
you're here waiting for Ramavtar to die

847
01:29:33,445 --> 01:29:35,675
You may as well earn money...

848
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:38,874
...and pass on some of it to me

849
01:29:39,182 --> 01:29:44,677
You better know that
I don't haggle over my price

850
01:29:44,788 --> 01:29:49,157
"I take 25 rupees, besides jaggery,
oil and flour"

851
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:51,624
To beat my breast and roll on the floor...

852
01:29:51,727 --> 01:29:55,288
Ten rupees a piece... Extra

853
01:29:55,397 --> 01:29:57,557
"If that suits you, tell me and I'll go"

854
01:29:57,665 --> 01:30:03,626
They'll give what you ask.
They've to show the village

855
01:30:03,737 --> 01:30:06,502
"How, under his very nose,
they used his own Rudali..."

856
01:30:06,607 --> 01:30:09,837
...to do the mourning

857
01:30:09,943 --> 01:30:13,379
"Pigs, all of them! Such hypocrites!"

858
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,913
I've contempt for them

859
01:30:16,015 --> 01:30:18,915
They try to humiliate one another
even during death!

860
01:30:19,017 --> 01:30:21,179
"Oh, stop grumbling"

861
01:30:21,286 --> 01:30:22,310
It's yes then?

862
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:24,910
Yes... You go. I'll follow you

863
01:30:25,957 --> 01:30:28,982
"Listen, I'll give you two rupees...
your commission"

864
01:30:29,093 --> 01:30:30,822
Make it five

865
01:30:30,894 --> 01:30:33,590
All right. Take five

866
01:30:38,835 --> 01:30:39,927
OH! My Master! My liege!

867
01:30:40,036 --> 01:30:41,594
"Alas! Oh, God!!"

868
01:30:41,704 --> 01:30:47,005
How cruelly unjust of You!

869
01:30:47,109 --> 01:30:54,207
"Why have You taken my liege so early!
Why, Oh, why!?"

870
01:30:54,315 --> 01:30:57,408
You have made everyone
in this village homelsess!

871
01:30:57,517 --> 01:31:05,288
Oh my Master!! Oh my liege!!

872
01:31:05,392 --> 01:31:07,951
"You bastard, let me go in!
Who are you to stop me!?"

873
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:10,289
Bastard! Alas! Oh my Master!!

874
01:31:10,395 --> 01:31:14,491
But she's Phoolbano!
His keep from whore-street

875
01:31:14,599 --> 01:31:21,766
She was his keep all her life

876
01:31:21,872 --> 01:31:25,831
"O Mayi, you know why they called you..."

877
01:31:25,942 --> 01:31:28,967
And pay you money to mourn him!?

878
01:31:29,678 --> 01:31:32,977
And he used to run even from your shadow
when he lived!

879
01:31:33,082 --> 01:31:36,642
"Because you are pure, that's why"

880
01:31:36,751 --> 01:31:38,844
"You are not a whore, that's why!"

881
01:31:38,953 --> 01:31:44,585
All his life he stayed clung to my body

882
01:31:44,692 --> 01:31:48,990
"And now that he's dead,
let alone touch him..."

883
01:31:49,095 --> 01:31:52,997
I can't even cry over his dead body!

884
01:31:53,166 --> 01:31:54,724
Can she cry...

885
01:31:54,834 --> 01:31:56,994
...the way I can!

886
01:31:57,302 --> 01:32:03,001
How can she ever weep the way I can!

887
01:32:04,041 --> 01:32:05,066
Oh my Master!

888
01:32:05,177 --> 01:32:08,942
Kick this whore out of here!

889
01:32:11,382 --> 01:32:16,341
Where were you all when I served the Master!?

890
01:32:16,453 --> 01:32:19,422
It's an insult to you
when a whore cries over your dead

891
01:32:19,522 --> 01:32:21,148
Is it nothing... of no value...

892
01:32:21,256 --> 01:32:25,022
...how you insulted my body when he lived

893
01:32:35,268 --> 01:32:38,237
You sit. I'll cook

894
01:32:38,338 --> 01:32:43,036
"No, you eat... And I'll serve you food"

895
01:32:45,945 --> 01:32:50,177
You have a house... a family...
I have no one

896
01:32:50,282 --> 01:32:54,980
I have never cooked for anyone or served

897
01:32:55,086 --> 01:32:59,249
Let me do it for a few days

898
01:32:59,356 --> 01:33:04,055
Then I can fulfil this desire too...

899
01:33:04,895 --> 01:33:08,057
Bhikni... May I ask you something?

900
01:33:08,164 --> 01:33:08,926
What?

901
01:33:09,031 --> 01:33:11,261
You've been crying at wakes for years

902
01:33:11,367 --> 01:33:14,733
"You have to weep a lot, I suppose"

903
01:33:14,836 --> 01:33:20,330
How does this stream of tears
flow from your eyes?

904
01:33:20,441 --> 01:33:24,275
That is the miracle...

905
01:33:24,378 --> 01:33:27,813
...how I can summon up
this stream of tears!

906
01:33:27,914 --> 01:33:31,077
Wait... I will show you

907
01:33:33,186 --> 01:33:36,086
Where're you going?

908
01:33:36,589 --> 01:33:42,891
What are you doing?

909
01:33:42,995 --> 01:33:46,953
This is my magic box!

910
01:33:47,064 --> 01:33:48,758
Kohl

911
01:33:50,134 --> 01:33:55,092
No... it has magical tears

912
01:33:55,271 --> 01:33:59,765
I apply a little in my eyes like Kohl...

913
01:34:02,611 --> 01:34:04,169
Water just gushes out!

914
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,247
Oh! How...

915
01:34:06,014 --> 01:34:08,574
"What've you done, Bhikni!"

916
01:34:08,683 --> 01:34:11,379
My head's splitting! I can't see anything!

917
01:34:11,452 --> 01:34:12,418
"Hey, Shanichari..."

918
01:34:12,486 --> 01:34:14,477
Oh Bhikni! You've blinded me!

919
01:34:14,555 --> 01:34:19,049
Oh Shanichari! You look just like a Rudali!

920
01:34:19,159 --> 01:34:20,523
Like a Rudali? How?

921
01:34:20,593 --> 01:34:21,082
Look...

922
01:34:28,701 --> 01:34:32,727
The sorrow in your heart
has hardened like wax

923
01:34:34,505 --> 01:34:38,100
No one has warmed it till now

924
01:34:38,642 --> 01:34:41,873
That's why it has not melted

925
01:34:41,979 --> 01:34:45,141
Your tears have dried up

926
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:52,153
"Cry, Shanichari... Cry"

927
01:34:52,721 --> 01:34:55,815
On the death of those who oppressed you...

928
01:34:55,924 --> 01:34:59,154
...make a pretence of mourning!

929
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:05,425
And... as the dead bodies of these
sinners grow cold...

930
01:35:05,532 --> 01:35:08,023
...so will your strength grow

931
01:35:08,135 --> 01:35:12,297
Find this new strength...
and make a new path...

932
01:35:12,404 --> 01:35:16,636
A way to bring out your contempt

933
01:35:16,742 --> 01:35:18,175
But Bhikni...

934
01:35:24,148 --> 01:35:25,172
"Yes, Bhikni..."

935
01:35:25,617 --> 01:35:28,313
"You can do it, Shanichari! Yes, you can"

936
01:35:28,419 --> 01:35:32,854
"And then, this is not real weeping, is it"

937
01:35:32,955 --> 01:35:35,186
You just have to make a show of it

938
01:35:35,258 --> 01:35:36,349
Have you gone mad?

939
01:35:36,425 --> 01:35:39,053
Mine own have died... and run away

940
01:35:39,228 --> 01:35:41,992
Not a tear came to
this dried up Shanichari's eye

941
01:35:42,064 --> 01:35:44,793
Can I now cry over someone's death!?

942
01:35:44,899 --> 01:35:47,868
Yes. You can cry

943
01:35:48,436 --> 01:35:52,201
You'll become a Rudali

944
01:35:54,108 --> 01:36:00,205
You'll get both money and respect

945
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:03,777
We'll peform at mournings together

946
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:07,148
There'll be two Rudalis
in the place of one!

947
01:36:07,253 --> 01:36:09,152
And then...

948
01:36:09,254 --> 01:36:14,692
"...this hunger, this thirst...
and this loneliness..."

949
01:36:14,859 --> 01:36:21,230
Nothing will remain!...
not this loneliness

950
01:40:10,330 --> 01:40:12,298
Bhikni...

951
01:40:12,398 --> 01:40:15,366
Who? ...Kalia?

952
01:40:18,537 --> 01:40:19,970
Me... Purushottam!

953
01:40:20,071 --> 01:40:21,436
"It's you, Purushottam!"

954
01:40:21,539 --> 01:40:27,170
Bhishamdata is very ill.
He wants you to come at once

955
01:40:27,277 --> 01:40:29,438
"Nothing to fear, is it?"

956
01:40:29,546 --> 01:40:33,277
I can't say but he has been vomiting
since yesterday

957
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:37,649
Come for a day...
and return the day after tomorrow

958
01:40:37,753 --> 01:40:40,051
Make it quick

959
01:40:51,899 --> 01:40:54,060
Quick. There's very little time

960
01:40:54,167 --> 01:40:58,126
Wait. I'll tell Shanichari I'm going

961
01:41:09,648 --> 01:41:10,740
Shanichari...

962
01:41:11,182 --> 01:41:14,412
Shanichari... - Hmm...

963
01:41:14,518 --> 01:41:16,486
I'm going.

964
01:41:18,055 --> 01:41:21,023
All right.

965
01:41:22,526 --> 01:41:25,426
"Oh, Bhikni! So late at night!"

966
01:41:25,528 --> 01:41:28,223
"Where're you going,
all covered in a blanket!?"

967
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:30,298
Someone has come for me

968
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:31,696
I'm going to Dongri

969
01:41:33,868 --> 01:41:36,167
Who's come to take you?

970
01:41:36,538 --> 01:41:38,505
Purushottam

971
01:41:39,006 --> 01:41:40,836
Bhishamdata has sent for me

972
01:41:40,941 --> 01:41:43,775
Bhishamdata...! Who is he?

973
01:41:47,546 --> 01:41:50,311
I'll tell you when I come back

974
01:41:50,417 --> 01:41:53,351
There is so much I have to tell you...

975
01:41:53,419 --> 01:41:56,513
I heard only your tale till now

976
01:41:56,622 --> 01:42:02,253
When you hear mine... you'll surely weep

977
01:42:02,427 --> 01:42:05,395
When'll you return?

978
01:42:05,562 --> 01:42:08,122
The day after tomorrow... By evening

979
01:42:08,231 --> 01:42:11,530
Come back soon

980
01:42:11,635 --> 01:42:14,330
It's only a matter of two days

981
01:42:14,437 --> 01:42:15,597
Sleep now

982
01:42:20,241 --> 01:42:24,871
Go back to sleep... Don't worry

983
01:42:49,801 --> 01:42:51,529
Master!! Hukum!

984
01:43:03,813 --> 01:43:07,509
Go and call the Rudali

985
01:43:08,018 --> 01:43:11,577
"Bhikni... Hey, Bhikni...!"

986
01:43:16,958 --> 01:43:17,925
Kalia...?

987
01:43:18,026 --> 01:43:18,787
What is it?

988
01:43:19,826 --> 01:43:21,590
Hukum is dying...!

989
01:43:21,696 --> 01:43:23,856
But not yet dead!

990
01:43:23,964 --> 01:43:27,730
Come... warm yourself

991
01:43:27,834 --> 01:43:30,063
The young Master has sent for her

992
01:43:30,169 --> 01:43:32,501
But Bhikni has gone to Dongri for two days

993
01:43:32,570 --> 01:43:36,529
Some Bhishamdata sent for her

994
01:43:42,247 --> 01:43:44,214
Bhishamdata...!

995
01:43:44,982 --> 01:43:46,006
You know him?

996
01:43:46,916 --> 01:43:50,408
The whole world knows him

997
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:53,353
He had his own touring company

998
01:43:53,456 --> 01:43:56,289
It had created a stir all over this area

999
01:43:56,392 --> 01:43:59,087
But what has Bhikni to do with
a touring company!

1000
01:43:59,194 --> 01:44:01,094
Didn't she tell you anything?

1001
01:44:01,196 --> 01:44:04,164
"Oh, what did Bhikni ever tell me"

1002
01:44:04,265 --> 01:44:07,030
She only heard my story

1003
01:44:07,135 --> 01:44:10,297
"Well then, you tell me"

1004
01:44:10,538 --> 01:44:14,837
Bhikni was romantic and crazy
after Bhishamdata

1005
01:44:14,941 --> 01:44:18,637
She left her home and family...

1006
01:44:22,614 --> 01:44:24,912
Kept woman! Yes

1007
01:44:27,453 --> 01:44:33,652
Let her come! I'll ask her

1008
01:44:33,758 --> 01:44:37,659
But how did she become a Rudali?

1009
01:44:37,761 --> 01:44:41,026
Then came the bioscope...

1010
01:44:41,131 --> 01:44:43,223
It put an end to touring companies

1011
01:44:43,332 --> 01:44:45,527
They all had to retire

1012
01:44:45,634 --> 01:44:48,933
But one has to earn a living

1013
01:44:49,038 --> 01:44:51,335
So she became a Rudali

1014
01:44:51,439 --> 01:44:56,138
Play-acting there...
And play-acting here too

1015
01:44:56,244 --> 01:44:59,338
Shanichari...

1016
01:44:59,447 --> 01:45:01,346
After the elder Zamindar dies...

1017
01:45:01,448 --> 01:45:06,078
...the young Master will not
live here anymore

1018
01:45:06,186 --> 01:45:10,349
Why not meet him at least once

1019
01:45:37,946 --> 01:45:41,006
"Beg pardon, Hukum - It's okay"

1020
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:43,382
"How are you, Shanichari"

1021
01:45:43,451 --> 01:45:45,386
I'm all right

1022
01:45:45,487 --> 01:45:51,914
I was very sad to hear
about the Thakur Sahib

1023
01:45:53,026 --> 01:45:57,394
All of us have to go one
day or the other...

1024
01:45:57,563 --> 01:46:00,589
Someone goes early... others later

1025
01:46:00,699 --> 01:46:04,327
That's how this world is... a fair

1026
01:46:04,502 --> 01:46:09,462
Why're you standing so far? Come here

1027
01:46:22,251 --> 01:46:25,687
"What have you done to yourself, Hukum!"

1028
01:46:26,989 --> 01:46:29,957
How do you know?

1029
01:46:30,058 --> 01:46:33,289
Have you even looked at me?

1030
01:46:33,461 --> 01:46:36,020
Look up...!

1031
01:46:36,864 --> 01:46:41,766
"Look up, I said"

1032
01:46:49,141 --> 01:46:54,773
Your eyes are exactly the same...

1033
01:46:55,547 --> 01:46:58,914
Honey brown...

1034
01:46:59,017 --> 01:47:03,509
"...like the desert.
I haven't forgotten, have I?"

1035
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:10,785
Budhua...?

1036
01:47:17,566 --> 01:47:20,534
About your daughter-in-law...

1037
01:47:20,635 --> 01:47:23,728
I had so many complaints against her

1038
01:47:23,838 --> 01:47:28,331
Mohanlal... And Lala... they had all...

1039
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:31,138
...wanted me to throw her out of the village

1040
01:47:33,046 --> 01:47:36,742
"How could I let that happen, Shanichari?"

1041
01:47:36,816 --> 01:47:37,805
Hukum...

1042
01:47:42,254 --> 01:47:45,883
"I heard that you were leaving the village,
Hukum"

1043
01:47:47,592 --> 01:47:52,085
"Hukum, someone has come to see Shanichari"

1044
01:47:53,197 --> 01:47:56,165
To see me! Here?

1045
01:47:56,867 --> 01:47:59,892
From Dongri... from Bhishamdata's place

1046
01:48:00,003 --> 01:48:02,436
Call him here

1047
01:48:02,537 --> 01:48:04,836
"Yes, Hukum"

1048
01:48:08,810 --> 01:48:12,439
"This palace seems desolate now,
Shanichari"

1049
01:48:12,547 --> 01:48:15,982
What did I have of my own here anyway...?

1050
01:48:16,083 --> 01:48:19,644
"Beg your pardon, Hukum"

1051
01:48:19,753 --> 01:48:20,845
Shanichari...

1052
01:48:21,087 --> 01:48:24,853
I have bad news for you

1053
01:48:26,892 --> 01:48:29,862
Bhikni died

1054
01:48:32,631 --> 01:48:34,325
The plague took her

1055
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:38,061
"As she was dying,
she said she was not Bhikni..."

1056
01:48:38,569 --> 01:48:41,196
She was Peewli...

1057
01:48:41,772 --> 01:48:47,869
She was your mother

1058
01:48:49,713 --> 01:48:50,509
Ma...!

1059
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:56,540
"The Master has passed away, Hukum"

1060
01:49:26,211 --> 01:49:31,910
Oh! Bhikni is dead!!
She has been taken away!!

1061
01:49:34,684 --> 01:49:35,913
Ma... Ma...!

1062
01:50:11,916 --> 01:50:18,946
Bhikni deceived me!

1063
01:50:21,058 --> 01:50:24,960
She has forsaken me!

1064
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:29,958
"Oh, Bhikni...!"

1065
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,960
Ma... O Ma... My Ma...!!
