1
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:18,322
How, when and in which life we
met to someone

2
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,413
We don't know about that

3
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:24,354
And then how do we meet them again
in which life.

4
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,291
Who are you?

5
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,317
Amazing!
Where did you come from?

6
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,488
How come you are here?

7
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,432
From the platform

8
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,459
What were you doing in bathroom?

9
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,268
Oh!

10
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,429
You are travelling ticket less...
Shut up!

11
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,271
How did you enter in this compartment?

12
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,241
All seats are reserved here

13
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,475
Please make some space

14
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,346
This entire compartment has been
reserved for me

15
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,447
You may leave now

16
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,248
It's impossible

17
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,326
Now I will leave in bombay

18
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,348
What you have done that you are
hiding from everyone

19
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,373
You have booked all the seats

20
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,350
You came here intentionally

21
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,411
You don't know me

22
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,246
Do you know who am I?

23
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:07,460
Govind!

24
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:10,497
Rukhsar!

25
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,370
Have some fruits...

26
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,448
You are creating scene

27
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,324
You are a filmstar

28
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,350
Am I right?

29
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,271
Are you a musician?

30
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,307
You are going to bombay to
try your luck

31
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,409
I also came from Lucknow

32
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,352
Me and my friend eloped from
the house

33
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
I wanted to become an actress

34
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:09,259
One day Raj Khosla saw me
outside the studio and...

35
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,394
And now you are super star

36
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,466

37
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,307

38
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,274
People like you doesn't

39
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,475

or Raj Khosla then...

40
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,271

41
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,359

43
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,484
Please get some mangoes for me

44
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,486
Even the train is also stopped

45
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,335
People always follow your orders...

46
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,239

47
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,435

Why did you laugh?

50
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,436

51
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,312
You became a filmstar to become famous

52
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,312

53
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,507

He came here to meet me

79
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,472

00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,264
To play guitar?

123
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,361
For movies or in hotels...

124
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,341
You can play with band in hotels

125
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,316
Strange man!

126
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,284
Somebody is talking to you and you
are not looking to her

127
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,418
Now what you have seen after that
how could I see you

128
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,425
What I have seen after that you
don't need to shy

129
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,268
You should be ashame to talk to
some guy like this...

130
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,267
Look!
What else you want to look?

131
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,336
Enough!

132
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,241
We shall finish it!

133
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,367
Who is shying?
Me or you?

134
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,241
Look!

135
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,247
There is only one way to finish it

136
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:50,321
Like you have seen me

137
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,413
same as that...

138
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,359
You can't do it!

139
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,522
If my window will be open then...

140
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,386
You won't see it!

141
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,270
Aunty was asking about you
Really!

142
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:36,235
She was saying that who is
that handsome guy?

143
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:37,306
What he does?

144
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,471
All girls in yourfamily is like this?

145
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,473
She was not asking about her self
She was asking for me

146
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,248
And it's not a surprising thing

147
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,410
I am not a girl of 1960

148
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,311
I will take my own decisions.

149
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,356
And you are taking decisions for me

150
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,418
I will decide it first

151
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,462
Have you gotjob?

152
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:07,489
I remember everything

153
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,300
ljust don't remember that why did
I eloped from the house

154
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:16,236
So basically

155
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,399
Those things make us feel like suitcase

156
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,277
those things are actually a lunch box

157
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,413
True!

158
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:03,424
Thankyou!

159
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:05,392
For what?

160
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,225
I will never forget this birthday

161
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:15,305
I should leave now

162
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,270
My train will come in 15 minutes

163
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,389
What's your name?

164
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,339
When will the next train come?

165
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,250
I have to go...

166
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,332
I am sorry I shouldn't fight with you
on your birthday

167
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:03,470
Anyways!
Where you have been?

168
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,452
With who?

169
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:13,489
You don't know them

170
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,357
I know your all friends...

171
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:20,291
Because you don't have time

172
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,403
One day when he wants to happy

173
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,407
Who does like this?

174
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:45,453
We got one fight and you can spend
a night with any girl

175
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,285
She is not an ordinary girl

176
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,482
We didn't fight

177
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:56,432
So you found someone else
in 2 hours

178
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,326
I didn't found someone

179
00:48:58,502 --> 00:48:59,434
It happened!

180
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,261
What do you mean it happened?

181
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,434
Don't call her a slut you don't
even know her

182
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,334
I am not calling her slut but you

183
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:10,437
I thought we shouldn't fight on
your birthday and you...

184
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,396
Who can spend her night with this slut
after the first meeting

185
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,432
but that's okay because we broke up

186
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:35,235
And how come last night you didn't
want to study

187
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,237
You didn't have to go to your work

188
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,467
You had all your time for
that Radha

189
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,469
Who is Raadha between Meera
and Krish!

190
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,376
We understand each other

191
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,279
There is only one way

192
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:21,374
Now don't tell me that you need
time to know someone

193
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:24,251
And I will say no...
Only one meeting is enough!

194
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:30,255
If there is a vibe between 2 people
so it is...

195
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,368
My vibe is only with my
cell operator

196
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:42,430
and nobody send me messages
than that

197
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,280
Thankyou! Bye!
And we won't meet again

198
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,253
You can trust me

199
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,359
But can I trust you?

200
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,218
By the way thanks for coming
on station

201
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,284
When people chat on sms

202
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:35,388
It won't happen with us

203
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:38,419
We will be like oldjeans

204
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:42,328
Perfectly comfortable from
the first meeting

205
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,298
Is everything alright?

206
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:22,438
Who is this Meera?

207
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:26,406
When?

208
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:28,501
That night we met

209
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,250
That night we met you broke
up with her and

210
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,443
you were with me all night,
Whats wrong with you all girls?

211
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,419
I said we broke up

212
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,479
Just 2 hours earlier...

213
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,361
If everything is over between you two
then why she is sending you messages

214
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,431
She is not sending me messages

215
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:08,247
About what?

216
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:13,322
You didn't break up with her

217
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:25,459
Are you calling her right now?

218
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:30,431
Are you still with her?

219
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:03,465
So you still have her photographs
in your mobile

220
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:06,374
I didn't get time to remove it

221
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,247
You didn't get time to remove
her photographs

222
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,373
but you have enough time to flirt
with me on side

223
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,274
You were not on side...

224
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:39,298
You are really enjoying this...

225
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:41,239
Do you think I am enjoying this...

226
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:42,368
But what I am gonna do...

227
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,286
If we would broke up...

228
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:57,220
so would you do this with me

229
01:02:28,474 --> 01:02:30,339
It's too late...

230
01:02:30,442 --> 01:02:31,568
Why he didn't come yet?

231
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:39,339
Somebody is coming

232
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:45,356
Go!

233
01:02:47,426 --> 01:02:49,326
I will be back

234
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,400
Parmindar was fine!

235
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:58,399
So when did I said something else?

236
01:02:59,471 --> 01:03:00,495
So why did you let her go?

237
01:03:01,373 --> 01:03:02,431
You didn't fall in love with her

238
01:03:22,628 --> 01:03:24,596
She came to dry a towel

239
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:26,520
Learn the signs...

240
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:28,327
Her parents would have gone

241
01:03:29,501 --> 01:03:31,469
She is giving you a signal,
She is not like that...

242
01:03:33,372 --> 01:03:34,600
However she is...
But how are you?

243
01:03:35,474 --> 01:03:36,441
I have doubt on you

244
01:03:36,575 --> 01:03:38,338
Are you parts working...

245
01:03:41,547 --> 01:03:42,536
Why you are provoking me?

246
01:03:43,549 --> 01:03:44,607
So do something...

247
01:03:45,417 --> 01:03:46,577
Otherwise someone else will have her...

248
01:04:11,376 --> 01:04:12,400
Girl's mom...

249
01:04:36,435 --> 01:04:37,459
Where are you running?

250
01:04:37,536 --> 01:04:39,595
Come upstairs!
I will slap on yourface

251
01:04:41,406 --> 01:04:42,430
What are you looking at?

252
01:04:42,574 --> 01:04:44,405
You were drying a dried towel?

253
01:04:44,476 --> 01:04:45,534
Where is your scarf...

254
01:04:50,482 --> 01:04:52,609
Whose picture will come on coin
after the freedom?

255
01:04:53,552 --> 01:04:55,417
Nowadays it's some British Minister's
picture on the coin

256
01:04:55,587 --> 01:04:57,487
What is this freedom?

257
01:04:57,589 --> 01:04:59,386
And what will we do with freedom?

258
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:00,516
I am still free...

259
01:05:01,526 --> 01:05:03,323
Who can bound my freedom?

260
01:05:03,395 --> 01:05:04,623
Freedom is in your mind

261
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:11,569
Howeveryou have freedom

262
01:05:12,437 --> 01:05:14,530
But you are with her...
Impossible!

263
01:05:16,408 --> 01:05:17,534
Thank God we didn't get freedom

264
01:05:18,477 --> 01:05:19,501
Otherwise she will go to England

265
01:05:20,479 --> 01:05:21,537
Then what would happened to
my freedom

266
01:05:45,537 --> 01:05:47,437
Do you know english?
Yes!

267
01:05:48,473 --> 01:05:49,531
Speak!

268
01:05:57,616 --> 01:05:59,584
You are flirting with mom or her
daughter?

269
01:06:11,596 --> 01:06:14,394
Once I will get that british girl

270
01:06:17,436 --> 01:06:18,494
Not like our indian girls...

271
01:07:06,385 --> 01:07:07,352
What are you doing here?

272
01:07:09,521 --> 01:07:11,352
I am learning british culture

273
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,448
and I am teaching them our traditions...

274
01:07:15,494 --> 01:07:18,327
Go from here otherwise...
Why you are so scared?

275
01:07:18,463 --> 01:07:19,487
They are screwing our country

276
01:07:19,631 --> 01:07:21,462
and I am screwing them,

277
01:08:09,381 --> 01:08:10,370
Who doesn't know you?

278
01:08:12,617 --> 01:08:14,517
This is foryou!

279
01:09:24,422 --> 01:09:25,446
Hide yourself under the bed

280
01:09:27,492 --> 01:09:28,424
Go!

281
01:09:46,444 --> 01:09:47,376
Who?

282
01:09:47,445 --> 01:09:49,413
That Indian guy...
who was running

283
01:09:50,515 --> 01:09:51,539
Amazing!

284
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:54,545
You six people couldn't catch
an indian guy

285
01:09:57,389 --> 01:09:58,378
Find him!

286
01:10:54,546 --> 01:10:55,570
British were following you

287
01:10:56,514 --> 01:10:57,481
And my papa says...

288
01:10:57,649 --> 01:10:59,549
Enemy of british people is ourfriend

289
01:11:00,518 --> 01:11:01,576
That's why I gave you shelter

290
01:11:02,621 --> 01:11:04,316
You may go now

291
01:11:05,357 --> 01:11:06,551
I know everything about you

292
01:11:08,493 --> 01:11:10,552
Because of your dad's thought we
met today

293
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:14,394
Thanks to your dad from my behalf

294
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:20,395
Where are you going?
If dad will see you

295
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:42,393
I won't need it closer

296
01:11:43,561 --> 01:11:45,495
but if I will have to call you
from the distance...

297
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:47,430
so from which name I shall call you?

298
01:11:47,465 --> 01:11:48,523
Aradhana!

299
01:11:50,402 --> 01:11:52,370
What happened to your voice?

300
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:59,374
Next week we have decided to protest

301
01:12:00,345 --> 01:12:03,314
Party people are coming today

302
01:12:03,515 --> 01:12:05,483
Make all the arrangements...

303
01:23:22,526 --> 01:23:23,458
Come!

304
01:23:24,562 --> 01:23:26,621
How are you?

305
01:23:34,505 --> 01:23:35,597
We will keep walking like this?

306
01:23:36,374 --> 01:23:37,602
Who cares?
Keep walking with everyone

307
01:26:58,576 --> 01:26:59,474
Get up!

308
01:27:42,453 --> 01:27:44,421
It's not a time to meet prisoners...

309
01:27:49,526 --> 01:27:52,495
Few village girls came for
prisoner's hospitality

310
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:55,463
So you also came with them
to meet me

311
01:27:58,569 --> 01:28:01,333
By the way this dress really suits you

312
01:28:07,645 --> 01:28:08,612
Look Jawed!

313
01:28:09,513 --> 01:28:10,537
This love is impossible

314
01:28:11,515 --> 01:28:13,415
You shouldn't love me alot

315
01:28:14,385 --> 01:28:16,444
Nobody should love someone

316
01:28:17,554 --> 01:28:19,385
You are telling this thing to me

317
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:20,522
oryourself

318
01:29:08,505 --> 01:29:10,370
I know you have done it for me

319
01:29:11,475 --> 01:29:14,535
But love doesn't mean to do
something for someone.

320
01:29:14,578 --> 01:29:16,409
So who loves another amongst
both of us

321
01:29:18,582 --> 01:29:19,606
I don't love you

322
01:29:20,517 --> 01:29:21,484
What's your age?

323
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:24,352
22 years!

324
01:29:26,490 --> 01:29:27,548
There is a phrase in our village

325
01:29:28,492 --> 01:29:30,585
If 22 years girl lied to someone
22 times

326
01:29:31,628 --> 01:29:33,425
then her most beloved thing

327
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:35,461
has beloved to Allah

328
01:29:37,367 --> 01:29:38,493
There is no phrase like that...

329
01:29:39,369 --> 01:29:41,462
And I don't love you

330
01:29:41,572 --> 01:29:42,402
One!

331
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:45,369
I said I don't love you

332
01:29:45,609 --> 01:29:46,576
Two!

333
01:29:55,552 --> 01:29:57,520
You should hold the plant
from the roots

334
01:30:02,459 --> 01:30:03,551
We will never be together

335
01:30:04,495 --> 01:30:05,393
Three!

336
01:30:06,396 --> 01:30:07,454
Put some water!
Yes!

337
01:30:09,366 --> 01:30:10,333
Are you thirsty?

338
01:30:12,536 --> 01:30:13,560
How many kids you want?

339
01:30:17,508 --> 01:30:18,600
When we won't get married then
how we will have kids?

340
01:30:19,376 --> 01:30:20,365
Why we won't get married?

341
01:30:21,411 --> 01:30:23,379
When there will be no love between us
then how we will get married

342
01:30:23,447 --> 01:30:24,345
Eight!

343
01:30:25,482 --> 01:30:27,347
No! No! No!

344
01:30:27,584 --> 01:30:28,448
Eleven!

345
01:30:32,623 --> 01:30:34,557
Why you are coming tojail
from past 4 weeks

346
01:30:37,494 --> 01:30:38,461
Twenty!

347
01:30:40,531 --> 01:30:41,429
What?

348
01:30:41,532 --> 01:30:42,590
Before I say something?

349
01:30:50,474 --> 01:30:53,443
Now let your most beloved thing
belove to Allah

350
01:30:55,546 --> 01:30:56,535
Andjust kill me...

351
01:43:18,621 --> 01:43:21,419
Now we will speak cute things

352
01:43:28,531 --> 01:43:30,431
We are like oldjeans

353
01:43:32,435 --> 01:43:33,561
But after that I will tell you that

354
01:43:35,505 --> 01:43:38,474
ljust broke up with 2 girls...

355
01:43:39,542 --> 01:43:40,531
And you will say

356
01:43:42,478 --> 01:43:43,376
I am the third one...

357
01:43:56,626 --> 01:43:58,491
Everything seems goon in beginning

358
01:43:58,595 --> 01:43:59,493
But later...

359
01:44:02,432 --> 01:44:04,400
Same old fights

360
01:44:05,435 --> 01:44:07,460
Again new connection with some
another guy

361
01:44:25,488 --> 01:44:26,580
Tomorrow for the last time...

362
01:44:36,599 --> 01:44:37,566
Who you send the message?

363
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:44,406
And Meera too

364
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:56,378
By the way how did you agree
for this wedding

365
01:45:57,613 --> 01:45:59,376
Jawed's Wedding!

366
01:45:59,615 --> 01:46:00,547
How it happened?

367
01:46:01,617 --> 01:46:03,414
I felt in love once in my life...

368
01:46:04,487 --> 01:46:05,511
And that won't happen again

369
01:46:06,489 --> 01:46:08,423
I thought I shall do something
for my dad's happiness

370
01:46:23,372 --> 01:46:25,340
Shakespear has written something
for every relationship

371
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,572
But totally wrong for me

372
01:46:32,648 --> 01:46:35,515
Whatever happened with me that might
won't happened with Shakespear

373
01:46:38,554 --> 01:46:41,421
My love story actually love stories...

374
01:46:42,425 --> 01:46:43,357
were so complicated

375
01:46:46,496 --> 01:46:48,396
We both loved wrong people

376
01:46:51,567 --> 01:46:54,434
You loved ajobless paying guest

377
01:46:57,573 --> 01:46:59,564
and I assume that movie is a real life

378
01:47:03,346 --> 01:47:04,335
but when the movie was over

379
01:47:13,489 --> 01:47:14,581
We both loved wrong people

380
01:48:20,456 --> 01:48:22,549
I wanted to see you for
the last time

381
01:48:25,461 --> 01:48:26,325
Last time?

382
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:33,365
Jawed Qadri's wedding...

383
01:48:35,371 --> 01:48:36,338
Why I wouldn't come?

384
01:48:39,375 --> 01:48:40,569
This is for dad's happiness

385
01:48:57,593 --> 01:48:58,560
I should leave now...

386
01:49:03,332 --> 01:49:05,300
It's not good for me to stay
here anymore

387
01:49:08,504 --> 01:49:10,404
Congratulations for life and marriage

388
01:49:54,617 --> 01:49:56,585
I think whatever was between us...

389
01:49:58,454 --> 01:49:59,421
Perhaps that was love

390
01:49:59,622 --> 01:50:01,419
But now we both know...

391
01:50:03,626 --> 01:50:04,524
that's not...

392
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:14,535
And Radha if you think that whatever
between us

393
01:50:14,603 --> 01:50:15,501
it's not love

394
01:50:16,372 --> 01:50:16,599
then I won't stop you

395
01:50:20,609 --> 01:50:24,340
Which day I and Meera broke up
that was my birthday

396
01:50:24,513 --> 01:50:27,380
Same day me and Radha met...

397
01:50:29,652 --> 01:50:31,620
And Radha please!
Don't ask me...

398
01:50:32,388 --> 01:50:34,618
that when, how, where...

399
01:50:46,502 --> 01:50:48,595
And if you will go from here...
Like you were going

400
01:50:52,641 --> 01:50:54,472
then I will must meet you somewhere...

401
01:51:02,651 --> 01:51:04,346
Make some space

402
01:51:27,476 --> 01:51:28,602
What you have done like...

403
01:51:30,446 --> 01:51:32,346
You are going in hurry

404
01:51:48,397 --> 01:51:49,386
Do you agree?

405
01:51:53,502 --> 01:51:54,594
Do you agree?

406
01:52:20,362 --> 01:52:21,329
Aradhana!

407
01:52:47,556 --> 01:52:49,353
I want to marry with your daughter

408
01:52:54,630 --> 01:52:56,393
Are you insane?

409
01:52:57,399 --> 01:52:58,457
What are you doing?

410
01:53:03,439 --> 01:53:04,337
Look!

411
01:53:04,607 --> 01:53:06,472
If you want to marry her

412
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:09,410
then you will have to marry
with Mumtaz first

413
01:53:10,346 --> 01:53:12,314
You are allowed for 4 marriages

414
01:53:12,481 --> 01:53:13,413
Let's go!

415
01:53:26,462 --> 01:53:27,588
I will marry with Aradhna four times

416
01:53:34,403 --> 01:53:35,370
Exactly!

417
01:53:35,638 --> 01:53:37,503
Why I hate you Krish?

418
01:53:39,441 --> 01:53:40,499
I love you too...

419
01:53:42,611 --> 01:53:43,543
Rukhsar!

420
01:53:49,552 --> 01:53:50,416
Govind!
