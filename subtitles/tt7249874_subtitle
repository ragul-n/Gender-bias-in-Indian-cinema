<i>Previously on "Imposters"...</i>

2
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:04,999
<i>Hi, Ez.</i>

3
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:08,069
<i>There is no easy way to say it,
but here it is.</i>

4
00:00:08,104 --> 00:00:09,970
<i>You will never see me again.</i>

5
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:15,276
<i>Sooner you accept it,
the better it is for everyone.</i>

6
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:16,811
- Where is she?
- I don't know where...

7
00:00:16,946 --> 00:00:18,279
- Where is she?
- I don't know where...

8
00:00:18,314 --> 00:00:19,980
- Ohh!
- I am her husband.

9
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:23,350
Yes, we married the same woman,
and she took us both.

10
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:25,686
<i>Do you have a picture of Alice?</i>

11
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:27,021
Well, that's her.

12
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,560
Hello, Alice.

13
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:30,774
Hello, Ava.

14
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:34,165
Hi, I'm Ms. Keyes.
You can call me Saffron.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,234
Ms. Keyes,
you are a breath of fresh air.

16
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,536
Well, aren't you
my knight in shining armor?

17
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:39,904
The way I see it, man,
you either want to find her

18
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,239
- or you don't.
- Oh, I do.

19
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,174
Then do whatever it takes.

20
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,575
What are you two zibs doing?

21
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,011
- Go, go, go!
- Oh, my God. Okay, okay.

22
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,279
That did not go well!

23
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:49,681
- This girl...
- Saffron.

24
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,783
Oh, such a pretty name.

25
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,017
And you like her?

26
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,386
<i>She makes me want to be nice.</i>

27
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,422
<i>I think you have good
luck with this girl.</i>

28
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,090
Come on, why don't you sit
with me for a minute?

29
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,758
Saturday I'm having a barbecue,

30
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,427
some friends, some family coming by.

31
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,228
Why don't you join us?

32
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,097
Max is just freaking out
'cause I talked to some guy

33
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,432
at a coffee shop.

34
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,267
<i>The Doctor sent me a message...</i>

35
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,569
<i>that anybody not in the life,
not like us,</i>

36
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:13,404
<i>is a liability.</i>

37
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:18,810
Who the hell are you?

38
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,445
Who the hell are you?

39
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,612
Do you know this woman?

40
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,315
- She's my wife.
- No way.

41
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,955
<i>And I answer the door,
and it's these two guys</i>

42
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,256
I've never seen before.

43
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,726
Like, one of them's kind of macho,

44
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,261
and the other's kind of not.

45
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,564
And they just start barraging
me with these questions,

46
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,265
like, demanding to see her, and...

47
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,334
Who?

48
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,670
CeCe. They were looking for CeCe.

49
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,672
Interesting.

50
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,674
Yeah, and they're telling me
they've come all the way from...

51
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,343
I don't know... someplace...
Indiana or something...

52
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,346
And they're sure... they're, like,
positive she's in my apartment

53
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,149
presently, and they have these
weird surveillance pictures

54
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,418
of her and other pictures of
her where she just looks totally

55
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,953
different, and they keep
calling her these other names,

56
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,021
like Amy and Ava or Alice or something,

57
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,790
which is just totally crazy-making.

58
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:09,026
Well, you actually
don't know her real name.

59
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,062
Yeah, I know, okay. I'm just saying.

60
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:13,598
Go on.

61
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,769
Anyway, then they tell me...

62
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,971
oh, man...

63
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,806
that she conned them too,

64
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,208
same thing, married them,
took all their money, disappeared.

65
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,877
- Really?
- Yeah, I know.

66
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,545
So now I'm starting
to get trigged, right?

67
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,380
So I do the positive
thinking that we worked on,

68
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,882
and I even take out my cards.

69
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,483
Great. That's what they're there for.

70
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,552
Yeah, I start reading
them to these guys loudly.

71
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:35,953
I'm saying, "She's gone.

72
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,355
"She's not here.

73
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,023
She's not coming back."

74
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,660
And still they won't shut up,
so I tell them forcefully,

75
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,395
"Whatever happened to you, I'm sorry.

76
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,130
Like, I'm genuinely sorry,
but I can't help you."

77
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,398
- Yeah, boundaries.
- Right?

78
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,733
I have done work on myself.

79
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,168
I have healed.

80
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,570
I refuse to be part
of some deranged, like,

81
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,639
seriously demented plan to go after her.

82
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,574
- Absolutely not.
- I'm fine. I'm over her.

83
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,809
Yes, you are.

84
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,210
I am fine.

85
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,912
I'm fine.

00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,720
Ma'am, please.

88
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,022
If you could just hear us out.

89
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,021
I told you.

90
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:14,058
It's odd-number alternate
side-street Tuesday.

91
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,760
And we're sorry. We misread the sign.

92
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:16,894
We'd absolutely move the car,
but we can't...

93
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,763
This one locked the keys inside.

94
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:19,997
Well, you didn't tell me
the keys were in the back.

95
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,892
Oh, do we have to have conversations
about everything now?

96
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:23,878
No, we don't have to have
conversations about which kind

97
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:27,271
of face cleanser is
unavailable in farm country.

98
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,539
Wow.

99
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,241
You guys have yourselves a nice day.

100
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,509
Please, ma'am.

101
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,045
Ma'am, ma'am, can we...

102
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,881
Clearly with your forces combined

103
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,983
you won't have any trouble finding her.

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,620
That was sarcasm.

105
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,623
Or do they not have that
where you come from?

106
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,225
- Uh...
- There's obviously no way

107
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,860
you're figuring out
where she is without me,

108
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:53,297
so... I'm in.

109
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

110
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,081
Brought you some coffee.

111
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,616
No, thanks. I already had mine.

112
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:19,223
Hey, I'm sorry if I was terrible Friday.

113
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,625
I don't remember much,

114
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,462
except that you were
a perfect gentleman.

115
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,697
Nothing to apologize for.

116
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,768
But I don't think this is
appropriate conversation

117
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,138
for the workplace.

118
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,408
Understood.

119
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,876
Let me know if you need anything.

120
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,812
You have a gift, you know.

121
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,724
It's true. You're a...

122
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,562
- natural.
- Yeah.

123
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,998
Um, you know, uh...

124
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,833
I am concerned we're not gonna finish

125
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,969
these end-of-quarter filings by Monday.

126
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,969
Well, I'm free this weekend.

127
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,719
It's on. He's taking me out
tomorrow night.

128
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,290
We're right on schedule.

129
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,459
Are we?

130
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:33,030
I told you I'll close
him tomorrow night.

131
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,232
Good.

132
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:41,446
_

133
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,712
What do you mean, I can't join?

134
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,313
What do you have, a club?
Like a boys' club?

135
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,248
- It's not a club.
- But we do have a code.

136
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,617
You guys came to me.

137
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,784
Yes, but we weren't looking for you.

138
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,766
We thought she'd be here.

139
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:56,887
We didn't know she'd
conned you before Richard.

140
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,756
Wait, what? She went from me to you?

141
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,324
Guess she must have thought
something was missing.

142
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,392
HPV?

143
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,160
Guys, come on. Can...

144
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,428
Wait. Did you give her HPV?

145
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,063
No.

146
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,286
- No.
- All I'm saying is,

147
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:08,998
- I can help you guys find her.
- That's not what you said

148
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:10,351
before, and you said
we were delusional...

149
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:11,702
- Pathetic...
- And that you were over her...

150
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:13,160
And you threw flashcards at us.

151
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,352
Do you guys want to find her or not?

152
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:15,656
Because clearly you need some help.

153
00:06:15,656 --> 00:06:17,566
Really? How so? What exactly do we need?

154
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:19,577
Help reading street signs,

155
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,978
someone to make sure
the keys are, you know,

156
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,080
not in the car when you lock it,

157
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,548
something about women.

158
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,350
- Told you, lesbian card.
- Oh, my God.

159
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,419
You guys are so far out of your league;
you have no idea.

160
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,954
- Well, we found you, didn't we?
- You weren't looking for me.

161
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,323
Well, yeah, but... still.

162
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:36,160
So what are you and SpongeBob
Square Jaw gonna do now?

163
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,662
You're sharing a bowl
of chicken noodle soup?

164
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,296
I bet you don't even
have money for lunch.

165
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,465
Hey, we didn't have money
for gas or hotels either,

166
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,867
but we figured it out.

167
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,535
- We don't need your help.
- Yes, you do.

168
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,537
No, we don't.

169
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,773
God, you are so desperate;
it's pathetic.

170
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:49,774
I am not pathetic.

171
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,375
Whoa, whoa.

172
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,377
Hey, Jules, listen,
seriously, no hard feelings,

173
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,479
we've all been through a lot,
but I really think it's best

174
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,114
if we just, you know,
went our separate ways.

175
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,784
No, you don't get
to just barge into my life

176
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,686
right when I was getting better,
when I was, like,

177
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,387
this close to getting over her.

178
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,624
You don't get to do
that and then reject me.

179
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,459
I reject you.

180
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,194
Reject us.

181
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,930
Jeez, man, what a freakin' psycho.

182
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,366
I don't know, man.
I think she's just heartbroken like us.

183
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:16,667
Like us, my ass, dude.

184
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,135
That chick is seriously disturbed.

185
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,870
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

186
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,338
What?

187
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,307
Augh!

188
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,341
You all right?

189
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,043
You hit me, you asshole.

190
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,445
You ran right into the street.
You hit me.

191
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,213
I can't feel my arm. Look what you did.

192
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,649
- You ran right into my car.
- You plowed right into me.

193
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,284
Oh, shit, my phone.

194
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,885
You broke my phone,
and you broke my arm.

195
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,687
All right, let's...
Okay, let's just calm down.

196
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:40,725
- This was not my fault.
- Did anyone see him hit me?

197
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,660
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. You hit her.

198
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:43,961
What? No.

199
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,296
- I... no, no.
- Yeah, you did, man.

200
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,864
I got it on video. You totally hit her.

201
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,365
Hey, someone... someone call the cops.

202
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,500
No, no, no. No, wait.

203
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,639
- I'm calling right now.
- Wait, no.

204
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,041
You do not need to call the cops.

205
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,743
We can handle this. We can handle this.

206
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,344
All right.

207
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,347
Can we? Can we... can we handle this?

208
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,915
- Can we handle it?
- Okay.

209
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,685
Okay? Okay, great.

210
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,686
Augh.

211
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,255
Here, just... just take it.

212
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,723
- Okay.
- Yeah, we're good.

213
00:08:13,582 --> 00:08:15,025
Well, get the hell out of here!

214
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,861
Watch where you're driving, bud.

215
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,730
Augh.

216
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,600
Augh.

217
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,601
You're not serious.

218
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,904
480, 490, 500.

219
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:29,261
Lunch is on me, boys.

220
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,710
Uh, how'd you do that?

221
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,045
You just threw yourself in
front of a car for 500 bucks.

222
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,380
Smacked my hands against the hood.

223
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,215
Didn't even touch me.

224
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,884
What?

225
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,186
How'd you guys get out
of your piano recitals?

226
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,222
So am I in or what?

227
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,860
Make yourselves at home.

228
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,697
Whoa.

229
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,900
This place is seriously large.

230
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,469
How often do you throw yourself
in front of moving cars?

231
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,470
It's not really mine.

232
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,305
Belongs to my parents.

233
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,475
After CeCe took everything,
they cut me off.

234
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,645
But I can live here as
long as I stay in therapy.

235
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,115
That way they can shame me
without feeling like monsters.

236
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,751
So my shrink told me to
throw away everything

237
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,720
that had any association with her.

238
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,490
I got as far as putting it in a bag.

239
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,898
Wow.

240
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,635
Wow.

241
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,118
So this is what you meant when
you said you were an artist?

242
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,755
I wouldn't expect you to get it.

243
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,427
All right, with what I know
about her and what you guys

244
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,762
know about her,
we might just find a clue

245
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,131
to who she really is.

246
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,873
Now let's find this bitch.

247
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,611
Don't call her that.

248
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:15,589
Sorry to disturb, Doctor.

249
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:17,257
There's an urgent call for you.

250
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:18,959
I told you no interruptions.

251
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:20,294
It's Dr. Steppenwolf.

252
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:26,100
Patch it through.

253
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:32,139
Yes.

254
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,041
I'm getting close, Doctor.

255
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:36,610
It's a complicated case,
and I'm not entirely sure yet

256
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:40,114
if the patient is truly infected.

257
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:42,649
<i>We need a prognosis as soon as possible.</i>

258
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,284
<i>If his disease turns out to be fatal,</i>

259
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,086
<i>I would hate for it to spread.</i>

260
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:48,655
I understand, Doctor,
and I'll have it for you very soon.

261
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,061
Very good.

262
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:23,857
Hello.

263
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:37,565
Hey, look who's here.

264
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,732
- Hey.
- You made it.

265
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:40,067
Yeah, I made it.

266
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:41,235
I can't stay too long.

267
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,403
I hope that's okay.

268
00:11:42,438 --> 00:11:44,138
No, I'm glad you came.

269
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:45,706
Yeah, me too.

270
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:47,441
Come on.
Let me introduce you to my friends.

271
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:49,577
Okay.

272
00:11:49,612 --> 00:11:51,412
Got Dave and Sheila.

273
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:52,947
- Hi.
- And this is my buddy Mark.

274
00:11:52,982 --> 00:11:54,582
- Nice to meet you.
- Good friends of mine.

275
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:57,484
In fact, the only friends
I kept from my old life.

276
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,253
You must be Saffron.

277
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:01,822
Ahh, my beautiful pain in the...
I mean, my sister Gina.

278
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:03,257
Hi. Nice to meet you.

279
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,825
- Come here.
- Oh, hi.

280
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:06,393
Mm, oh, look at you.

281
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,429
You are just as stunning as he said.

282
00:12:08,464 --> 00:12:09,730
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, come on.

283
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:11,398
You're giving up the goods now.

284
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:14,001
And this beautiful young lady
here is my Auntie Colleen.

285
00:12:14,036 --> 00:12:15,970
Auntie, this is my friend Saffron.

286
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:18,606
Hi. Nice to meet you.

287
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:19,840
Her name is what?

288
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:21,842
It's Saffron, Auntie, Saffron.

289
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:24,678
What kind of name is that?

290
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:29,817
- We should go get a drink.
- Come on.

291
00:12:29,852 --> 00:12:31,151
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- Yeah, let's get a drink.

292
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:35,990
Ugh, let's just keep going, okay?

293
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:37,324
What about her favorite food?

294
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,592
Lasagna.

295
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:40,160
- Popcorn.
- PÃ¢té.

296
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,263
- Popcorn?
- Yeah, weird, right?

297
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:44,031
She used to eat it one at
a time like a little bird.

298
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:47,201
Oh, put allergic to peanuts
and shellfish up there.

299
00:12:47,236 --> 00:12:48,936
- I don't remember that.
- Are you kidding?

300
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:50,938
She was, like, terrified
even of being near shellfish.

301
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:52,606
It was pretty annoying.

302
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:54,375
Popcorn was really the
only thing that annoyed me.

303
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,609
The only thing? I had, like, 100.

304
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:57,011
Well, yeah, obviously.

305
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:58,612
What do you mean, obviously?

306
00:12:58,648 --> 00:13:00,347
That was her M-O, okay?

307
00:13:00,383 --> 00:13:03,284
For you, she was drama and provocation.

308
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:05,019
For him, she was poise
and sophistication.

309
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:08,155
For me, she was...
everything I ever needed, I guess.

310
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,690
Ugh, please.

311
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:11,859
All, you guys, come on.
Come on. This is stupid.

312
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:13,460
How are we supposed to
know what's even real

313
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:15,029
if she was completely
different with each of us?

314
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:16,864
We just have to find one
thing that rings true

315
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,499
for all of us, all right?

316
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:20,467
She... She couldn't have been
faking everything.

317
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:22,336
Definitely not the sex. That was real.

318
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,104
At least for me, man. She was a freak.

319
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,839
Okay, you know,
I don't want to hear this.

320
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,975
Well, then you definitely
don't want to hear about

321
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,543
the time her and I went to Vegas.

322
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:31,679
Oh, my God, dude.
We met this chick from Zumanity.

323
00:13:31,714 --> 00:13:33,747
That's the one where
they're naked acrobats.

324
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:35,082
Bro, we were in the elevator,

325
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:36,216
and she unzips my fly, swear to God...

326
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:47,227
<i>So she bends over, lifts up her skirt,</i>

327
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:50,431
- and right as I'm about to...
- That's enough.

328
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:51,865
So she can talk about shellfish,

329
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:53,267
but I can't talk about sex?

330
00:13:53,302 --> 00:13:54,568
I thought we were searching
for the truth here.

331
00:13:54,603 --> 00:13:56,036
Well, here's the truth.

332
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:57,705
Just because you got off
doesn't mean she did.

333
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,039
Oh, she got off, sweetheart.

334
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,708
Let me tell you something else.

335
00:14:00,743 --> 00:14:02,876
After you, she was clearly
done playing with toys.

336
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:04,511
Oh, my God. Seriously?

337
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:05,612
Ready for the D.

338
00:14:05,648 --> 00:14:07,681
- Jesus, both of you, stop it.
- Oh, wow.

339
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:09,450
What about stories from her past?

340
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:10,851
Like, did she ever tell you
anything about when she was

341
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:13,520
a kid, stuff about her childhood?

342
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:15,856
You know,
I remember a story about a dog.

343
00:14:15,891 --> 00:14:18,559
- A... A bichon.
- A bichon.

344
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:21,562
Yeah, yeah, she really loved it,
but this one time...

345
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:23,764
- It ran out of the house...
- And into the snow...

346
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,566
- And the dog was all white...
- So they couldn't find it...

347
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:26,934
Because snow is white.

348
00:14:28,838 --> 00:14:31,372
- And she was super sad.
- Right, it was gone for days...

349
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:32,973
- But then it came back...
- Like a miracle.

350
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:34,380
- Just in time for...
- Winter solstice...

351
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,163
- Christmas.
- Hanukkah.

352
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:36,484
Oh, my God. You guys.

353
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,445
Write it down. Write it down.
Write it down. Write it down.

354
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:41,420
"She had a dog."

355
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:48,155
Oh, that's sure as shit not helpful.

356
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,223
No, no, no.

357
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:50,791
See, now you're making
it sound all flaky and...

358
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:52,760
No, first it was yoga.

359
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:54,161
Then it was painting.

360
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:56,163
Then it was building
schools in Cameroon.

361
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:57,798
Yeah, well, hold on. Hold on. Wait.

362
00:14:57,834 --> 00:14:59,600
Are you really gonna give me
shit about building schools?

363
00:14:59,636 --> 00:15:01,168
Tough crowd, man.

364
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,070
Thank you. See, she gets it.

365
00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:04,405
I'm finding my passion.

366
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,035
I'm on a journey here.

367
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,708
Leave me alone.

368
00:15:07,744 --> 00:15:09,043
Okay, fine.

369
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:11,178
You can go eat-pray-love yourself.

370
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:14,148
I am going to just drink your wine.

371
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:17,118
Oh, sorry. His latest thing is wine.

372
00:15:17,153 --> 00:15:19,120
See, now, that's not true.
That's not even true.

373
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:20,988
I've always been into wine.
What are you talking about?

374
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:22,289
Patrick, a year ago,
you didn't know the difference

375
00:15:22,325 --> 00:15:23,958
between a Merlot and a mermaid.

376
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:26,560
Now all of a sudden he's
buying vineyards in Oregon.

377
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:28,229
Oh, yeah, and we're making
some elegant pinots,

378
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:30,264
- I should say.
- Oh, my God.

379
00:15:31,934 --> 00:15:33,467
Yeah, I don't mind a pinot now and then,

380
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:36,337
but I've always been more
of a cab girl myself.

381
00:15:36,372 --> 00:15:39,039
They're just as complex as a pinot

382
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:42,543
but not as delicate and fussy.

383
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:43,711
- Hmm.
- Mm-mm.

384
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:45,980
You say fussy.

385
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:48,473
I say sophisticated.

386
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:54,355
You know, the thing about cabs,

387
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,525
they're the most adaptable of vines.

388
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,926
You can plant them just about anywhere,

389
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:00,427
and as long as you tend it,

390
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:03,097
they'll always give you
something beautiful.

391
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:05,499
We're still talking about wine, right?

392
00:16:05,535 --> 00:16:06,832
Hear, hear.

393
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:11,071
Anybody ever tell you there's
sort of a mystery to you?

394
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:16,577
Like, how do you know
so much about wine?

395
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:18,846
Not very mysterious, really.

396
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:22,550
When you work in a restaurant,
you learn about wine.

397
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:25,019
I can see why he likes you.

398
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:30,958
There's something about him.

399
00:16:30,993 --> 00:16:34,962
I don't know. It's just... easy.

400
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:37,031
Mm-hmm.

401
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:38,699
Maybe it's too easy.

402
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:40,901
Is this something he does,

403
00:16:40,937 --> 00:16:44,705
bring the new girl to the barbecue?

404
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,040
Is my brother a player?

405
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:48,776
Is that what you're asking me?

406
00:16:48,811 --> 00:16:50,578
Hey, a girl has to wonder.

407
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:53,547
Look, if you had asked me that
a year ago,

408
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,783
he's just... he's been through a lot.

409
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:57,585
I mean, we all have.

410
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,355
I don't know how much he's told you,
but he's changed.

411
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:04,124
I think he's into you.

412
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:08,796
And for once, I approve.

413
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:53,173
Are you lost?

414
00:17:56,545 --> 00:17:58,212
Such a big house.

415
00:17:58,247 --> 00:18:01,382
Mm, listen to me...

416
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:03,984
whatever your name is.

417
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,288
My nephew is a really fine young man.

418
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:11,392
But he doesn't know people,
not the way I do.

419
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:43,528
Viv.

420
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:46,792
Oh!

421
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:48,093
Oh, Mr. Heller.

422
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:50,596
You scare me.

423
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,030
I listen to podcast.

424
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:54,066
I finish now.

425
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:58,537
Sorry, I just...
Well, I wanted your opinion.

426
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:01,807
Oh, I see.

427
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:05,644
For business or... something else maybe?

428
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:06,912
Something else maybe.

429
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:08,413
Oh, wonderful.

430
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:10,949
The same woman as before?

431
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:13,785
I can see you like her, this one, yes?

432
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:16,455
Mm, people think she's a certain way,

433
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,058
but she's got something.

434
00:19:20,094 --> 00:19:24,763
Oh, Mr. Heller, you stop my heart.

435
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:27,766
This one here.

436
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,468
Mm, yes.

437
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,270
<i>I'm glad to make a new friend, Saffron.</i>

438
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:32,738
Same here.

439
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:34,239
Yeah.

440
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:35,908
- I'll call you later.
- Oh, you better.

441
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:38,410
Hey, it was so nice to meet you.

442
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,678
All right, Auntie, you ready to go?

443
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:41,580
- Yes.
- Bye, y'all.

444
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:43,348
I am not an invalid, Gina.

445
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:44,783
- Stop...
- Okay, all right.

446
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:46,518
Love you, guys.

447
00:19:46,554 --> 00:19:48,186
Love you.

448
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,523
Whew.

449
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:54,660
Yeah, Auntie does not like me at all.

450
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,995
Oh, don't feel special.
She doesn't like anybody.

451
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:59,364
- Oh, yeah.
- Mean old lady.

452
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:09,308
Yeah, she's just been
having a hard time lately.

453
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:14,513
Lost her sister recently, my mom.

454
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,381
I'm so sorry, Patrick.

455
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:17,816
Yeah.

456
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:20,118
Oh, I love this song.

457
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:24,723
Mm.

458
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:46,211
So what about your family?

459
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:47,825
Your folks?

460
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:52,251
Not much to tell.

461
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:55,887
You know, pretty boring suburban family.

462
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,190
Yeah, are you close with them?

463
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:01,393
I was once.

464
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,696
I don't really see them much anymore.

465
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:07,532
Kind of complicated.

466
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:11,069
Mm, yeah, family is always complicated.

467
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:12,437
Mm-hmm.

468
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:17,442
Do you find most things complicated?

469
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:22,014
Usually.

470
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,882
Yeah.

471
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:29,054
Me, I think that some
things can be pretty simple.

472
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:49,941
- What?
- Uh...

473
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:55,814
Don't say what I think
you're about to say.

474
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:57,363
No, please don't.

475
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:01,053
It's just... I... I'm sorry.

476
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:03,822
I just can't right now.

477
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:05,791
Listen, I spent
the better part of my life

478
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:07,926
pushing good things away.

479
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:10,962
I don't want to live like that anymore.

480
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:16,101
All you have to do is be
open to possibilities.

481
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:18,303
I am...

482
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,305
open to the possibility

483
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:23,909
of being your friend.

484
00:22:23,944 --> 00:22:24,910
Ohh... ohh.

485
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:31,016
Well... no, I can...
I can live with that.

486
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:32,818
I can live with that.

487
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,586
Hey, how about you stay for dinner?

488
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:38,290
We order in, keep it simple...
as friends, obviously.

489
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:39,358
What time is it?

490
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:40,525
Um...

491
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:41,960
Shit.

492
00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:44,162
I'm sorry, I-I-I lost track of time.

493
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,630
I'm so sorry.

494
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,666
I've got to go. I'll see you, um...

495
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,034
Sunday.

496
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:50,836
Yeah.

497
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,363
In here.

498
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:20,031
Oh, hey.

499
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,334
Oh, so sorry I'm late.

500
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:24,536
Oh, you won't believe what happened.

501
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,205
My neighbor had a massive
fire in her kitchen,

502
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:30,876
like, a real fire,
and her cat just had five kittens,

503
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,544
and she couldn't find them all.

504
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,514
I mean, what was I gonna do,
not help her find the kittens?

505
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:37,349
And my phone had died,
and that's why I couldn't call.

506
00:23:37,384 --> 00:23:40,218
Anyways, how are you?

507
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:43,021
I am much better now that you're here.

508
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:46,558
Wow, and what a special place this is.

509
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:50,662
Well, as we have to be discreet, right?

510
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:54,433
Of course. We have lots of work to do.

511
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:57,068
- Wine?
- Yes, please.

512
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:58,170
Thank you.

513
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,242
And that's when I decided to
have my gallbladder removed.

514
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:39,478
You know, the organ
that helps the body digest fat.

515
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:41,213
Yeah, I heard all about it on "Dr. Oz."

516
00:24:41,248 --> 00:24:43,615
It's not a vital organ, though.

517
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,284
Runs in my family,
these gallbladder issues.

518
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,286
Wow, what else
were you gonna do? I mean...

519
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:49,421
It's genetic.

520
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:50,989
Right?

521
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:51,990
Jinx.

522
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:52,799
Oh.

523
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:58,497
You know, this is... it's really nice.

524
00:24:58,532 --> 00:25:01,266
Just being able to sit and talk.

525
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,469
It's rare.

526
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:06,638
It's really... it's rare, but,
you know, when it happens,

527
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,540
it's... it's really special.

528
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,179
Heh, of course, well...

529
00:25:42,643 --> 00:25:44,009
- Saffron.
- Hmm?

530
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:45,877
Do you not like your moo shu?

531
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:50,749
I love it.

532
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:10,182
Hi.

533
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:13,018
Oban, please. Neat.

534
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:22,661
I'm guessing Toledo

535
00:26:22,697 --> 00:26:25,464
or Columbus maybe.

536
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,333
But it's Ohio somewhere.

537
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:28,868
Close, Saint Louis.

538
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:33,639
Ahh, see, I am... I am good at this.

539
00:26:33,674 --> 00:26:34,974
Put hers on mine, please.

540
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:36,976
Oh, that's... that's not necessary.

541
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,164
You know, the hardest thing
about being on the road,

542
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,567
you feel like you never
get to be hospitable.

543
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,069
And it starts to make you
feel like less of a person.

544
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,339
So from one fellow traveler
to another, hmm?

545
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:53,142
Well, thanks.

546
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:55,478
Yeah.

547
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,685
I'm Max.

548
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Geraldine.

549
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:08,491
So this is my son Peter.

550
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,560
And this is Stephanie.

551
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:12,728
She's the youngest.

552
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,163
They look like great kids.

553
00:27:14,198 --> 00:27:15,865
Oh, they're pains in my friggin' ass.

554
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,800
But God, I love 'em.

555
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,071
So how about you? You got any kids?

556
00:27:22,106 --> 00:27:23,439
I had a dog once.

557
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:25,708
Oh, well...

558
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:28,010
No, I just never settled down.

559
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:32,181
I could have a few times,
but something always took me away.

560
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:35,384
It's too late now, you know?

561
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,854
You know, I saw this mug
the other day in the...

562
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,024
the Newark airport gift shop.

563
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,926
You know what it said?

564
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:47,630
It said "If you wanted to,
you would have done it."

565
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:51,033
And I just thought, "Yes,
that's right," you know.

566
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:54,236
I mean, when it comes down to it,
we all choose the life

567
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,872
that we want.

568
00:27:56,908 --> 00:28:02,311
I mean, even if it isn't
the life we say we want.

569
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:03,312
Did you buy the mug?

570
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:05,448
Ahh, I shoulda.

571
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,123
So this is actually the 4.6-liter.

572
00:28:14,158 --> 00:28:17,893
I had the 3.5, but this takes
my horsepower from 350 to 386.

573
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,429
And, you know, I kind of
thought about it, but I thought,

574
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:23,599
sometimes you just,
you know, you've got to...

575
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:24,800
You got to go for it.

576
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,169
Absolutely.

577
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,272
Sometimes you just have
to splurge, you know,

578
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,374
go with what feels right.

579
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:41,650
Mmm.

580
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,289
Mm, Gary...

581
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,958
- Oh, no.
- Thank you so much

582
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,861
for a... such a wonderful evening.

583
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,462
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

584
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,998
- I didn't...
- No, no, it's not you.

585
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:58,134
You're perfect. It's just... it's me.

586
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,336
I... I don't want to rush things.

587
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,837
- Can I walk you to the door?
- Good night.

588
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,152
Shit.

589
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:34,203
I miss you.

590
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,860
- Alice...
- Don't give up, sweetheart.

591
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:43,933
Remember what I used to say?

592
00:29:43,968 --> 00:29:45,267
Yeah.

593
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:47,169
You said that we could do anything,

594
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:50,573
Mm-hmm, and we will,

595
00:29:50,608 --> 00:29:52,775
everything we've always dreamed of.

596
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,577
Yeah.

597
00:29:54,612 --> 00:29:56,946
Tell me the plan again.

598
00:29:56,981 --> 00:30:00,850
I love it when you talk about the plan.

599
00:30:00,885 --> 00:30:04,920
All right, phase one:

600
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:07,490
you're not just a car salesman.

601
00:30:07,525 --> 00:30:10,426
You're the face of the dealership.

602
00:30:10,461 --> 00:30:13,462
You do all the commercials.

603
00:30:13,498 --> 00:30:14,630
I love phase one.

604
00:30:14,665 --> 00:30:15,998
Mm-hmm.

605
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:21,203
Phase two: you run for state senate.

606
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:24,306
State senate sucks.

607
00:30:24,342 --> 00:30:28,410
Phase three: you make powerful friends.

608
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:31,714
Okay, fancy dinners.

609
00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:33,215
I look good in a tux.

610
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:35,951
Yeah, you do.

611
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:39,355
Phase four:

612
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,158
you run for the real senate.

613
00:30:43,861 --> 00:30:47,796
Senator and Mrs. Richard Evans.

614
00:30:47,832 --> 00:30:49,020
That's right.

615
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:56,038
But I can't do any of it without you.

616
00:30:56,073 --> 00:30:58,040
I mean, we were that couple
that everyone looked at

617
00:30:58,075 --> 00:31:01,744
and was just like, "Damn."

618
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:06,015
Why can't it be like that again?

619
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,716
It can.

620
00:31:07,752 --> 00:31:10,819
You're going to find me.

621
00:31:10,855 --> 00:31:13,923
Just have to keep looking.

622
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:16,325
And I promise you will.

623
00:31:18,196 --> 00:31:21,030
I know...

624
00:31:21,065 --> 00:31:23,098
We've got cheesesteaks.

625
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,103
I'm not hungry.

626
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:30,439
What the hell was that?

627
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:31,473
He's gluten-free?

628
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,163
Let me ask you a question.

629
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:53,289
CeCe, Ava, Alice.

630
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:59,429
You ever thought about killing her?

631
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:01,464
I have.

632
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:03,100
I've thought about it.

633
00:32:04,936 --> 00:32:08,571
Before, I never understood how someone

634
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:12,809
could kill another person,
like, take away their life.

635
00:32:12,844 --> 00:32:15,845
But now...

636
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:23,419
My therapist, he says
we're attracted to people

637
00:32:23,455 --> 00:32:25,788
not just because of the
good things about them

638
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:29,158
but also because of their pain.

639
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:34,597
Like, my pain
is attracted to their pain.

640
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:39,902
Do you think she feels pain at all?

641
00:32:39,938 --> 00:32:43,673
Like, if this is what you do,
and if this is your thing,

642
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:47,210
conning people into loving you,
what does that do to you?

643
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:55,018
I still don't understand how
someone can make you love them

644
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:59,789
and then just walk away
like it was nothing.

645
00:32:59,824 --> 00:33:02,458
How do you do that?

646
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:03,969
I don't know.

647
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:07,797
But you know what all the con books say?

648
00:33:07,832 --> 00:33:10,433
- Mm?
- For a successful con,

649
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:13,803
you need a willing mark.

650
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:16,729
We wanted every single lie she told us.

651
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:24,480
But I have to believe someday
it's gonna catch up to her.

652
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:29,145
Yeah.

653
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:23,072
Jesus.

654
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:25,733
Yes, I intercepted Heller's
courier last night,

655
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:26,576
and you were right.

656
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:28,411
<i>That bastard was taking
way more than his cut.</i>

657
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:31,247
The launderer has been
stealing the laundry.

658
00:34:31,283 --> 00:34:33,249
<i>Looks exactly as you suspected, yes.</i>

659
00:34:33,285 --> 00:34:34,617
For how long?

660
00:34:34,653 --> 00:34:37,120
Best I can tell, almost two years.

661
00:34:37,155 --> 00:34:39,322
<i>He could have skimmed close
to 2 million from you.</i>

662
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,827
Scorched earth mode, Max.

663
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:46,296
<i>We get the 2 million back.</i>

664
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:47,997
<i>We take everything he's ever had.</i>

665
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:49,499
<i>We destroy him.</i>

666
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:50,633
Yes.

667
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:52,235
<i>Yes, Doctor.</i>

668
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,572
I have a concern about Maddie.

669
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:58,541
Is she getting distracted?

670
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,009
No, I've got it under control.

671
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:03,446
Huh, I'm not so sure.

672
00:35:03,482 --> 00:35:05,315
Maybe I need to send Lenny Cohen.

673
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,083
No, there's no need for Lenny Cohen.

674
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:09,752
I... I'll... I'll take care of it.

675
00:35:26,505 --> 00:35:29,105
It's hopeless.

676
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:32,175
We tried. We really did.

677
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,544
No, we didn't.

678
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:38,414
But if we give up now, we suck.

679
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:39,048
You know what I think?

680
00:35:39,116 --> 00:35:40,917
I think our lives
are like a murder scene.

681
00:35:40,918 --> 00:35:44,257
Perfectly cleaned up.
No clues left behind.

682
00:35:44,523 --> 00:35:46,122
We need that stuff.

683
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:47,690
What's that stuff that the police use

684
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:48,992
to see where the blood was?

685
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:50,293
Oh, Luminol.

686
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:52,161
Yes, we need some Luminol up in here.

687
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:54,197
Maybe it's better this way.

688
00:35:54,232 --> 00:35:55,798
At least now she can't destroy us

689
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:59,002
with all her inside information.

690
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:00,970
What are you talking about?

691
00:36:01,006 --> 00:36:03,006
The envelope she left in the freezer

692
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,507
after the good-bye video.

693
00:36:04,543 --> 00:36:08,177
She left me an envelope
with information in it.

694
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:11,047
Bad stuff you'd never want anyone to...

695
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:12,715
Why are you looking
at me like I'm crazy?

696
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:15,018
I have literally no idea
what you're talking about.

697
00:36:15,053 --> 00:36:16,158
Yeah, me neither.

698
00:36:16,158 --> 00:36:19,622
You guys are so full of...
I bet whatever's in your folder

699
00:36:19,658 --> 00:36:21,024
is way worse than what's in mine.

700
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:22,759
Yeah, man, who gives a damn?

701
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:24,727
It's all in the past, right?

702
00:36:24,763 --> 00:36:27,096
- Never backwards.
- Always forward.

703
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,567
That's what she'd say to me in French

704
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:32,435
when I was bummed out about work.

705
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,507
She's say that to me when I
had a fight with my family.

706
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,175
I put a little bit of
weight on over the holidays.

707
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,244
I'd beat myself up,
and she would say it to me.

708
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:42,579
Hey, could that mean something?

709
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:44,447
I don't know. It's just a saying.

710
00:36:44,482 --> 00:36:46,049
Yeah, maybe like a fortune cookie or...

711
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:48,217
Yeah, no, but it's a...
what do you call it, a... a...

712
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:49,719
- A motto.
- Yeah.

713
00:36:49,754 --> 00:36:52,155
Yeah.

714
00:36:54,092 --> 00:36:56,693
Looks like it's a translation
of a Latin phrase.

715
00:36:56,728 --> 00:36:57,794
Hey, man, what's the Wi-Fi password?

716
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:01,798
- Could you spell that for me?
- Check it out.

717
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,366
It is a motto...

718
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:04,767
Oh, never mind. I'm on.

719
00:37:04,803 --> 00:37:07,403
For five high schools
plus a Jesuit seminary

720
00:37:07,439 --> 00:37:09,439
and a soup kitchen in Nova Scotia.

721
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:12,241
Guys, what if one of these
places was her school?

722
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:14,611
Oh, that would be huge,
man, track down her roots?

723
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:15,912
How do we narrow this down?

724
00:37:15,947 --> 00:37:17,380
Well, two of these are all-boy schools,

725
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:19,482
so we can scratch those off.

726
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:22,919
I mean, I think we can all agree
she's always been a girl, right?

727
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:29,959
Oh, and here.
This one wasn't even founded

728
00:37:29,995 --> 00:37:30,960
until three years ago.

729
00:37:30,996 --> 00:37:32,295
So that just leaves...

730
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,631
Three schools, one in Texas,
one in Florida,

731
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:35,765
and one in Pennsylvania.

732
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,233
That's still too many.

733
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:38,835
Holy shit.

734
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,269
- Guys, Panther.
- What?

735
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:42,438
St. Agnes Academy in Pottsville,
Pennsylvania.

736
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:43,773
Their mascot is a Panther.

737
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,441
So?

738
00:37:45,477 --> 00:37:47,176
That was her name for me.
She used to call me Panther.

739
00:37:47,212 --> 00:37:49,012
- No, she didn't.
- No, no, hey, she did, okay?

740
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:50,513
I don't mean to offend you guys,
because I know you're both

741
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:51,848
total freakin' prudes, but yes,

742
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:53,783
we had names for each other when we...

743
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:54,951
Dude, we get it.

744
00:37:54,986 --> 00:37:56,919
You guys had great sex.

745
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:59,255
We're not going to a place
called Pottsville for that.

746
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,349
Okay.

747
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:03,760
F...

748
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:05,161
Wait a minute.

749
00:38:05,196 --> 00:38:07,597
In the dog story, the one she told us,

750
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:10,166
in all three versions, it was winter.

751
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:11,276
So?

752
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:15,038
Oh, my God. You're right.

753
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:16,339
What?

754
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:17,940
The dog gets lost in the snow.

755
00:38:17,976 --> 00:38:20,343
- Yeah.
- In the snow. Think about it.

756
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:21,978
- Texas...
- Florida...

757
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:23,846
Pennsylvania.

758
00:38:23,882 --> 00:38:25,148
Pennsylvania. That's what...
That's what I'm saying.

759
00:38:25,183 --> 00:38:26,549
The Panthers are in Pennsylvania.

760
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:27,650
Pottsville, here we come.

761
00:38:27,686 --> 00:38:28,885
- Yes!
- Yes!

762
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,853
Good job, guys. Good job.

763
00:38:37,296 --> 00:38:38,836
Where is Pottsville?

764
00:38:38,871 --> 00:38:40,171
About an hour away from Philadelphia.

765
00:38:40,257 --> 00:38:41,890
- We set off now, we'll be there...
- No, no, no, no, no.

766
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:45,014
- Seriously? Another one?
- It's alternate odd-number

767
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,216
- side-street Thursday.
- Oh, come on. Please?

768
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:48,985
- It's already Thursday?
- Come on.

769
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,140
Shit, man.

770
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,754
We still got to get the
keys out of the car.

771
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,972
Hey, what about a coat hanger?

772
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:54,657
No, we're not using a coat hanger.

773
00:38:54,692 --> 00:38:56,325
Yeah, dude, I read a book about it.

774
00:38:56,361 --> 00:38:57,994
Dude, you unbend it,
and then you slip it down...

775
00:38:58,029 --> 00:38:59,629
Coat hanger your own car.
Absolutely not.

776
00:38:59,664 --> 00:39:01,898
You slip it down... I don't have a car!

777
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:04,000
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

778
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:07,170
What in... Are... This is my car.

779
00:39:07,205 --> 00:39:09,005
And now it's unlocked.

780
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,207
Are you crazy?

781
00:39:11,242 --> 00:39:13,609
Oh, my God.

782
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:15,444
Did you see what she did?

783
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,080
Richard, I've waited two years for this.

784
00:39:18,116 --> 00:39:19,515
We're not wasting any more time.

785
00:39:19,551 --> 00:39:21,317
Now, get in the goddamn car.

786
00:39:23,354 --> 00:39:24,987
Oh, my God.

787
00:39:25,023 --> 00:39:28,157
Addition to the code:
no further damage to personal property.

788
00:39:28,193 --> 00:39:30,092
You guys were serious
about having a code?

789
00:39:30,128 --> 00:39:31,794
Oh, it's real. You're sitting on it.

790
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,430
Additional addition to the code:
no sitting on the code.

791
00:39:34,465 --> 00:39:36,098
What are you gonna put it under glass

792
00:39:36,134 --> 00:39:37,533
at the National Archives?

793
00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:40,269
Can we just have some quiet, please?

794
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:43,139
<i>Here we go.</i>

795
00:40:06,231 --> 00:40:08,164
From the guy over there.

796
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:11,844
No, thanks.

797
00:40:13,548 --> 00:40:15,148
Come on, gorgeous.

798
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:18,151
Oblige me.

799
00:40:18,186 --> 00:40:20,553
Makes me feel like I'm
not drinking alone.

800
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:22,789
Maybe you should find some friends.

801
00:40:22,824 --> 00:40:25,458
Let's you and me be friends, huh?

802
00:40:25,493 --> 00:40:27,894
What's your name, sweetheart?

803
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:30,296
I bet you've got a pretty name.

804
00:40:30,331 --> 00:40:33,900
Go back, sit down,
and mind your own business.

805
00:40:36,571 --> 00:40:38,438
What you gonna do if I don't?

806
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:45,078
Ow. Ahh-ahh!

807
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:49,849
The name's Lenny Cohen.

808
00:40:55,657 --> 00:40:57,223
You bitch!

809
00:40:57,258 --> 00:40:59,826
Get back here!

810
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:01,027
Get back here!

811
