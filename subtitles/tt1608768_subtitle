Welcome, Mr. Dhuri. Have a sea.

56

Your housing loan
has been sanctioned.

57
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,466
I'd need your signatures on a form.

58
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,334
Yes.

59
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,576
Sign next to the cross marks.

60
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,573
And I have to give you a
receipt of your advanced payment.

61
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,673
I'll be back in a moment.

62
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,417
Anand, are you sure you
want to takethis apartment?

63
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,955
Of course.

64
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:40,120
Actually, dad said, "Why
don't you try at Shivaji park?"

65
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,596
He's willing to help us.

66
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,464
I don'twant your father's money.

67
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,434
Sorry.

68
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,038
But why parel?

69
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,676
Becausethere existed
a mill on this land.

70
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:06,048
My fatherworked there for 35 years.

71
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,254
We've been living
together for one year now..

72
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,063
..you didn't tell this to me.

73
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:22,231
I don't know. I take a little
longer timeto trust someone.

74
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,266
Whytoday?

75
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,071
Because I trust you.

76
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,257
Let's go.
- Where?

77
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,197
Just comewith me.

78
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:44,686
Just comewith me.

79
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,560
Anand, why did you
bring me on theterrace?

80
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,567
What's up here
worth watching? - Aah.

81
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,306
This is our house.

82
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,627
Can you seethat tenement?
- Which one?

83
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,321
Right next to that tall building.

84
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,391
The one on the left?
- No, on the right.

85
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,161
Those houses with earthen
tiled roofs. - Yes. Yes.

86
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,330
We'd livethere. Laxmi Cottage.

87
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,700
If you go straight, you'll
cometo the parel T.T. road.

88
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,574
A group of four or
five would go together.

89
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,148
Ifwetook the shortcut,

90
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,549
My school was there.
Shirodkar High School.

91
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,953
That's the K.E.M hospital.

92
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,318
Which one? The one
with earthen tiled roof?

93
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,551
No. That dome-like structure.

94
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,694
Just oppositeto it
is Wadia Hospital.

95
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,120
That stone structure.

96
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,632
You know Wadia Hospital?
- No.

97
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,401
Thewhole of parel took
birth in that hospital.

98
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,062
The moment a girl gets married..

99
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,003
..she'd register
her name over there.

100
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,033
That's so funny.

101
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,602
Yes. I was also born there.

102
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:09,942
The dining hall of our
apartment at Shivaji park..

103
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,550
..we'd all livetogether
in a room half its size.

104
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:19,183
Mother, father,
Naru, Manju, Mohan, I and Anna.

105
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,090
We all were naughty.
We'd wreak havoc.

106
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,060
Everyonewas poor.

107
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,633
And what was the name of
the tenement? Laxmi Cottage.

108
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,433
Manda.
- Yes.

109
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,473
Make some tea.
- Okay.

110
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,340
Writer, what are you writing?

111
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,245
What can I write in this chaos?

112
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,410
Mother, give me that glass.

113
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,617
Listen. Don't use up all the water.
I just filled it. - Okay.

114
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,484
'Right arm over the wicket.
This is the first delivery.'

115
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,457
'And it's a full-toss.
And it was struck..'

116
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,686
Why are you bowling a full-toss,
you shameless?

117
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,365
Give it to me quickly.
What's the delay?

118
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,630
T.ake this.

119
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,609
Idiot, where are you lost?

120
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,948
papa..
- You'll ruin the business.

121
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,586
Instead of ten, you're giving
her a Rs.100 note, you fool.

122
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,692
Who's peeing from up there?

123
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,694
Darn you!

124
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,963
Keep it closeto your heart
and listen to your transistor.

125
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,689
I'll burn it in a
stove once and for all.

126
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,400
Idiot, come out and look how
much water you've spilled.

127
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,003
Mother, I won't clean it.
I'm telling you.

128
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,699
Give methetransistor.

129
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,702
Go away. Zaheer's
wicket has just fallen.

130
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,033
We have a chance to win.

131
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,610
Naru brought that transistor.
It's not yours.

132
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,272
Give it to me. - The cells
are mine. Don't irritate me.

133
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,043
Mohan, give it to me. I have
to listen to 'Vividh Bharati'.

134
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,947
This is a different matter.
Go water the basil plant.

135
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,077
Stop this nonsense!

136
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:30,612
Is this a house or a fish market?

137
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,056
I can't write a
line in this madness.

138
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,020
All these years, he
could write only one line.

139
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:39,397
I'll slap you, Manju.
- Will I take it? - Manju!

140
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,222
Quiet. Let him write.

141
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,267
What is he going to
achieve bywriting?

142
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,131
It's no use writing is this house.

143
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,104
Then find some other place.
Grea writer, are you?

144
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,168
Have you ever earned
even Rs.5 for the house?

145
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,969
Rane's daughter Savita gets Rs.75..

146
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,342
..from the
newspaper for her recipes.

147
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,380
Don't compare those
useless recipes to mywriting?

148
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,580
I'm writing a new play
for the prithvi festival.

149
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,620
It seems we'll watch your play
at prithvi (Earth) in Heaven.

150
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,220
Why recite sermons to donkeys?

151
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,058
There's only money
on your rotten minds.

152
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,388
What else do wethink ifwe
have a freeloader in the house?

153
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,967
If you really feel so bad,
then go take up a job.

154
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,332
Don't talk to me about job again.

155
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,329
I'll go away now.

156
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,170
All daythey talk about job,
money. Money or job.

157
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,015
Manju! Manju!

158
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,079
Manju, give methetransistor.

159
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,682
Manju!
- Oh, Mother!

160
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,980
Sorry.
- Why are you saying sorry?

161
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,050
No, actually..
- What?

162
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,120
Are you wearing only atowel?

163
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,161
Aunt, you'retoo much.
You talk nonsense.

164
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,700
Mother! Mother!

165
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,970
Mother, if awicket
falls in this while..

166
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,632
..I'll break
Manju's legs. I tell you.

167
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,073
T.o hell with your cricket.

168
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,507
Will you take a leave
because ofthe match? - I'm going.

169
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,276
Give metea quickly.
- "Give metea quickly."

170
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,677
He's a cricket fanatic. He
doesn't care about anything else.

171
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,690
Nirupa Roy, Ashok Kumar is here.

172
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,592
What happened?
- I'll tell you.

173
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,464
Will you give a
glass ofwater first?

174
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:24,193
Manju, come in the kitchen!
Give your father a glass ofwater.

175
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,471
Will Mohan's hands rot
and fall if he gives it?

176
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:30,472
Manju, I'll slap you.
- I'll give you afitting reply.

177
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,507
Go ask your father first.
- Go away! - Hey!

178
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,037
Aren't you done with
the morning squabbles?

179
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,582
They don't let me live
in peace even for awhile.

180
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,215
You're lucky. The
youngest son is not home.

181
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:40,653
He didn't give me mutton,
Ganya. Hewas acting arrogant.

182
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:45,090
He didn't give me mutton,
Ganya. Hewas acting arrogant.

183
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,490
How dare Usman do that?
Did he saythat to you?

184
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:53,061
Yes. He's become arrogant
dueto his mutton business.

185
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,696
He refused when I asked him to give.

186
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,332
Did you tell him I wanted it?

187
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:01,098
Then what? - Speak up.

188
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,971
I.. told him. - Then?

189
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,977
But he said, "l don't know Naru."

190
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,104
"l won't givethe mutton."

191
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,413
He slapped me on my cheek.
Look atthe marks.

192
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,542
Where?

193
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,086
It doesn't last so long.
It disappeared.

194
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,951
You didn't tell him?
- I told him..

195
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,389
"lf Naru deals with you,
you'll be in trouble."

196
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,484
So the bearded guy pun..
- punched.

197
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:29,066
punched me in my ribs.
It Hurts here, you know.

198
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,464
There he is sleeping.
- Darn you! Idiot! - Hit him!

199
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,234
Don't you know me? - What happened?

200
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,708
Brother Naru!- You hit my friend!
What happened?

201
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,343
Brother Naru, why
are you hitting him?

202
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,471
What do you mean why?

203
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,947
I sent him to get some mutton.
He didn't give it.

204
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,484
Instead, he hit this kid. Idiot!

205
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,610
Brother Naru, listen to me.

206
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,155
Usman, I'll burn your shop. I won't
wait for the riots. I'm telling you.

207
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,614
Why did you hit him?

208
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,693
He didn't say anything.
Hewas bullying me.

209
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,027
He should have said
that he's Naru's friend.

210
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,656
Didn't you tell him?

211
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:06,128
He shouldn't know that
I'm your right hand.

212
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,706
Are you crazy? You
want to instigate a fight.

213
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,339
He hit me.

214
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,975
Sorry, Usman. Okay,
now give me 2kg mutton.

215
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,444
pack 2kg mutton. - Okay, sir.

216
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,377
I'll go get a shave.
T.ake the mutton home.

217
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,382
Sorry, Usman. Sorry, Brother.

218
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,985
Sorry, buddy.
- Make the pieces small. - Yes.

219
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,448
This is too much?

220
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:27,021
Add liver pieces too.
- Add liver pieces. Quickly.

221
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,684
pack this. - What do you
call that.. - T.esticles?

222
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,324
Add testicles as well.
- Add testicles.

223
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,956
Don't act smart. play properly.

224
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:41,336
"l was flying a kite.."

225
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,565
Hi, padma Khanna.

226
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,634
What is it, idiot?
What did you bring?

227
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,341
Mutton.

228
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:51,949
Aunt, Naru has sent mutton.

229
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:56,385
T.o prepare mutton dry and liver fry.

230
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,355
I'll fry my liver
and serve it to Naru.

231
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,482
Lunch is ready.

232
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:01,616
Listen, have your tea.

233
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,319
I'd have brought it much earlier.

234
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,395
But Usman was acting difficult.

235
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,189
What kind of acting?

236
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:13,965
It's not that kind of acting
as in plays. I was just joking.

237
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,997
You brought the mutton.

238
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,409
Who will bring ginger,
chilies, coriander and tomatoes?

239
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:21,536
Naru's father?

240
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,080
I'll get it. I've been
doing thattill now.

241
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,316
I'll give you all that.

242
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,381
The kid had brought it.
So do prepare it.

243
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,980
We'd also have some.

244
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,119
This greedy woman
is waiting for that.

245
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,491
Quiet. Don't talk nonsense.
- She's right.

246
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,692
When will "His Highness" come?

247
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,625
He's in a saloon getting fresh.

248
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,263
You too join us over lunch. Okay?
- Yes, fine. I'll surely come.

249
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,035
Sister Manju, the sari is wonderful.

250
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,201
Uncle.
- Yes.

251
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,345
Get your pajamawashed sometimes.
- Go away!

252
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,576
May you rot in hell!
- Mohan, sit down and have your tea.

253
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,481
I'll be late atthe office.

254
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,078
When don't you go late?

255
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,984
T.akethis. Drink it quickly, dear.

256
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,686
Yes, serveteato the kids.
Givethem lunchboxes.

257
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,964
Don't give me anything though.

258
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,089
Have patience.

259
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,598
Let theworking people leave.

260
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,225
Really? I'm the only one
unemployed in the family.

261
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,130
And where is she going so decked up?

262
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,140
She's going to learn at Chitra's
beauty parlor. - Really? - Yes.

263
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,711
I'll get paid from the
first of next month.

264
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,945
Mother, I took Rs.12 from the rack.

265
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,611
Manju! Manju!
- I'll give it to you later.

266
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,689
I'd kept the money for theflour.
- Let her go.

267
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,457
These kids won't listen.

268
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,957
You're lucky, girl.

269
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,960
You don't have such nuisance.

270
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,388
I've been waiting for that
nuisance since 12 years.

271
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,466
I didn't mean..

272
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,698
Can't you think before you talk?

273
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,339
By mistake..
- Okay.

274
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,506
Dharmendra. Hema Malini.
I'm leaving.

275
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,335
Okay, bye.

276
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,514
Listen, I'll give you tea.

277
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,675
Dharam.

278
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,685
"When the train
leaves the station.."

279
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,217
What now?

280
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,261
I'll be getting the cassette
at night. 'Ek Duje Ke Liye'.

281
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,488
What do you mean?

282
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,965
Drop by at night and I'll tell you.

283
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,035
Aunt, you'retoo much.
You do that everyday.

284
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,338
What happened?
- Where? Nothing. It's nothing.

285
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,341
What happened?

286
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,418
Did you meet the leader?

287
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,020
What about the money?

288
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,018
It's been six months sincethe
workers have got their salary.

289
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,698
Who will think about
retired workers like me?

290
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,001
But Mr. Khaitan has said
he'll pay all the workers.

291
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,405
That's what I've been
hearing for six months.

292
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,565
I know.

293
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,577
But Mr. Khaitan is a nice man.

294
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,309
But his son-in-law is
very cunning. Idiot.

295
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,148
I had a couple of jewelry left
till lastweek. We sold that too.

296
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,282
It's the same in every family.

297
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,319
You don't get money if you retire.

298
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,287
And you don't get it
even ifyou go to work.

299
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:27,688
Only Lord pandurang knows
what He's written in our fates.

300
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,085
What's that?
- Read it.

301
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,222
Where are you going?

302
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,955
Ganya, come here. Come here.
- Let go of my hand.

303
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,089
They aretaking away our livelihood.

304
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,164
This section will be
shut from tomorrow. Read it.

305
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,427
Hey, what's going on?

306
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,265
Don't shout. I'll slap you.

307
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,395
It's management's orders.

308
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,701
How is that possible?
- Don't ask me anything.

309
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,509
Then who should we ask? Who?
- How would I know?

310
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,634
Sit. Sit down.
- Yes, okay. - Sit right here.

311
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,507
Ganya, call Rane.
- Call Rane!

312
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,945
Call Rane! - Call Rane!
- Shut down the machines.

313
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,951
Hey Dubey! Shut down the machines!
Come on! - Call Rane!

314
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,291
Where's the notice?

315
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,629
Sir, they've put the notice here.

316
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,034
Hey you.. - You see it for yourself
the noticethat they've put.

317
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:46,633
Why are you putting
up all these notices?

318
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,569
Who asked you to
put up these notices?

319
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:52,074
Rane, I was ordered to put
up these notices. I did that.

320
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,412
Why are you angry with me?

321
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:57,318
You management's broker! - Don't
hit me. - Is the union dead or what?

322
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,680
Govind.
- You're putting up notices.

323
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,024
T.akethis and give it to the owner.

324
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,491
Let's go.
- What are you looking at?

325
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,620
Rane, tell him. He can't hit me.

326
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,993
Go away.
- Darn it.

327
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,500
Govind, what's the use
of tearing offthe notice?

328
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,000
Do you want us to remain silent?

329
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,104
Let's talk to the doctor.

330
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,072
This is not the wayto behave.

331
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,476
I think we should take
the matter to the police.

332
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,635
Calm down, Son.

333
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,174
Unions aretough to deal with.

334
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,207
You need to think with a cool head.

335
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,048
By the way, what is the
reaction of the workers?

336
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,485
Sir, processing
workers have become violent.

337
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,952
Now, workers from the
spinning and weaving departments..

338
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,323
..have struck work
and are protesting.

339
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,452
So let them.

340
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:38,620
How long with they strikework?

341
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,961
Look, my son.. - papa, if
we go soft on theworkers..

342
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,001
..theywill dictate terms to us.
- Okay.

343
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:48,066
But let us think how
to tacklethat doctor.

344
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,573
Yes. -Sir. Dr.
Sawant and Rane are here.

345
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:53,702
Okay.

346
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,342
Think of the devil.
- What happened?

347
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,007
The doctor is coming.

348
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,999
Welcome, Doctor. Welcome.

349
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,467
Why are you welcoming me?

350
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,335
Mr. Khaitan, what nonsense is this?
- What happened?

351
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,975
How could you shut down a
departmentwith 200 workers..

352
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,634
..without informing the union?

353
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,642
The workers had an idea.
- Did you ask the union?

354
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:32,080
We informed the old union.
- T.o hell with the old union!

355
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,208
Did you ask us?

356
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,412
Why should we? The mill is ours.
It's making losses since years.

357
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:37,681
Who says it's making losses?

358
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,957
Compared to last year,
24000 meters..

359
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,992
..of more cloth was
produced this year.

360
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,288
What do I do with that cloth?
It doesn't sell in the market.

361
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,056
I've not come to talk to you.

362
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,697
Mr. Khaitan, you're fooling us.

363
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,365
You're outsourcing the
printing of the cloth..

364
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,629
..and are shutting down
the processing department.

365
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,228
Don't we know that the
yarn goes to Bhiwandi?- Yes.

366
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,568
It's your ployto close the mill.

367
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,699
Why shouldn't we close it?

368
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,443
Overheads have gone up. It's
difficult to run the mill.

369
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,603
Let us run it.

370
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,241
We'll make more
profits than you could.

371
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,007
Arewe crazyto give such a
huge property into your hands?

372
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,518
Hey! This mill is not your father's.

373
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,215
We shed our blood and sweat for it.

374
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,247
You built bungalows
out of our hard work.

375
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,689
Govind, calm down.
- Why should l?

376
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,551
What's hetalking about?

377
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,619
He's living off his father-in-law.

378
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,322
Doctor, control him.

379
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,556
Forget about controlling him.

380
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,492
Just tell mewhether you're
starting the department or not.

381
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,327
It's highly impossible.

382
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,232
Fine.

383
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:36,570
Ifthat's your stand, then now
we'll fight outside on the streets.

384
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,141
You'll regret it.

385
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,409
Let's go.

386
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,014
Dogs.

387
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,420
They've become egotistical!

388
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,091
These mill owners
have become arrogant!

389
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:55,631
They have become haughty!

390
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,696
Who built this city?

391
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,200
These mill owners? No!

392
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,408
You have built Mumbai.

393
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,646
This citywas built dueto the
hard work ofthe mill workers.

394
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:15,680
And these mill owners
think thatthey own Mumbai!

395
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,011
Applause!

396
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:24,021
Those idiots don't
need the mills now.

397
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,198
Theywant high-rises.

398
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,229
Theywant 5-star and 7-star hotels.

399
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:36,406
You are now a disease for this city.

400
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:41,971
That's why they are saying
that the mills have gone sick..

401
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,945
..and are shutting
them down in a hurry.

402
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,186
I've heard that the
government will be passing a law.

403
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,312
They are coming up with a rule.

404
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,548
It is called 'DC' or something.

405
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,961
Oncethis rule is enforced,
these mill owners..

406
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:01,032
..will take advantage ofit
and sell the mills and the land.

407
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,967
These jackals are out to
tear this mill land into pieces.

408
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,403
Who owns that land?

409
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,477
T.ell mewho owns it. Their fathers?

410
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:21,975
The government gavethis land
on leaseto them for 99 years.

411
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,684
You provided cloth to
this city of Mumbai.

412
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,586
These mill owners will leave
you naked in this same city.

413
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:33,960
Shame on them! Shame on them!

414
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,967
In the past two years, the
owner of Khaitan mills..

415
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:41,004
..forced 700 workers to retire.

416
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,332
They have not yet been compensated.

417
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,976
Salaries of 1200
workers who work here..

418
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,603
..have not been
paid since six months.

419
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,082
That's exactlywhat's going on
in every other mill in Mumbai.

420
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:56,210
But remember.

421
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:03,422
If you take away our livelihood,
we'll not let you live in peace.

422
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,302
Who says hewon't give?
- We'll take it, no matterwhat!

423
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,965
Who says hewon't give?
- We'll take it, no matterwhat!

424
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:18,703
My dear worker friends.

425
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:22,241
Every mill should have a leader.

426
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,948
My associate Arvind Rane is
successfully..

427
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,951
..Ieading at Khaitan mills.

428
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,587
Stand by him firmly.

429
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:36,319
Arvind Rane, move forward!
We are with you!

430
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:39,691
Who says hewon't give?
- We'll take it, no matterwhat!

431
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:44,594
I helped him get a job in the mill.
He has become a big man.

432
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:49,496
It feels nice. - Long livethe
workers' union! - He's a good man.

433
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,974
Long livetheworkers' union!

434
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,241
What's thetrump card? - Waste.

435
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,003
Darn it!

436
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,209
T.ake care, Shirya. T.ake care.
We'll win this hand.- Yes.

437
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,052
You're playing cards all thetime.

438
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,456
What happened at the mill?
- An attack.

439
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,961
The momentthe doctor stands up,
everyone goes weak in their knees.

440
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,153
It seems we'll get the money soon.

441
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,696
Wewant a party when
you get the money. Okay?

442
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,027
Don't count your
chickens before they hatch.

443
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,299
Theywant to party!
- What are you looking at?

444
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,496
playthetrump card.

445
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:21,629
I'll play it only ifl have it.

446
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,571
That means we're
losing this hand for sure.

447
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:28,171
Here's your beer.
- Have a glass ofbeer.

448
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,241
Wow!
- Who have you duped, Uncle?

449
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,240
Sold two rooms in the
tenement opposite ours.

450
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,544
Whose?
- parab and Dalvi.

451
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:39,146
Who bought them?
- He's a Marwari. He paid cash.

452
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,618
pandu, I've been asking you to
sell my room sincethree months.

453
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,159
But you've been avoiding me.

454
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,395
Man, look at the
condition of your room.

455
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,020
The buyer doesn't
return after seeing it once.

456
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,998
Give it a single
coat of paint atleast.

457
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,327
I don't have a single penny.
How do I paint it?

458
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,596
Mywife earns a little.
I live offher.

459
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,501
I don't have the salary either.

460
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,242
Friend, you'vewaited until now.
Wait a little longer.

461
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,141
Yes, the settlement will
happen in a week or two.

462
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,336
T.o hell with the settlement.

463
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,312
I'll sell my room and
go back to the village.

464
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:10,011
Uncle, 'beedi'.
- Remaining 10 paise?

465
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,452
I ate a chocolate.

466
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:12,614
Is it your father's money?

467
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,488
What are you doing,
Kashi? Why do you hit a kid?

468
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,454
Shameless!
- I value every penny.

469
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:22,090
Then stop smoking. You
made her drop out of school.

470
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,028
Will my father pay her fees?

471
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,968
The teacher sent her home
becausewe couldn't paythe fees.

472
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,698
The mill worker is
as good as a beggar.

473
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,270
And whatwill you do in Konkan?

474
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:35,702
I'll sell toddy.
- Keep your daughter to sell liquor.

475
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,439
What happened?

476
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,007
It hurts.

477
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,016
Haven't you done waxing before this?

478
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,011
No.

479
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,951
So, why are you
getting it donetoday?

480
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,025
I haveto go.
- Who is it?

481
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:51,486
Who else?

482
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,992
That same guy opposite our room.

483
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,189
Jignesh.

484
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,357
Is it thefirst time?

485
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,963
What do you mean?

486
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,626
Waxing and all?

487
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,072
You shouldn't do anything
likethatthefirst time.

488
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,973
You should havetheir moneyfirst..

489
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,338
..and then let them
have what theywant.

490
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,377
Not even a kiss?
- Kiss will do.

491
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:15,676
Where are you meeting?

492
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,479
Bandstand.

493
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,825
"O beloved, come into my arms."

494
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:24,955
"O beloved, come into my arms."

495
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,325
Manju, here. Here!

496
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,357
Come inside the car.

497
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,332
What is it?
- Sorry. Sorry.

498
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:36,601
"My beloved, come and embrace me."

499
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:50,949
How are you?

500
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,313
What will happen to me?

501
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,104
Hey, just a minute!
- What happened?

502
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,615
It's made of gold. 22 carat.

503
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,182
Imported from Dubai.

504
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,059
Really?
- Yes.

505
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,624
What happened?

506
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,698
No. No. Don't. Don't. Listen!
- Let me. - No!

507
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,336
Let me do it, darling.
- Let me go!

508
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,632
What happened?

509
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:47,540
You jump here like a monkey.

510
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,980
And your father doesn't
lend us grocery so easily.

511
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,240
We've always repaid
every pennywe owed.

512
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,209
When my father gets the money..

513
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,684
..I'll throw it at
your father's face.

514
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,949
T.ake back your chain.
- Let it be. - I don't want it.

515
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,026
Let it be.
- I don't want it. - Just a minute.

516
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,586
T.ell my father that
you gave methe money.

517
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:08,994
Really?
- Yes.

518
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,061
By God promise.

519
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,229
I love you.

520
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:22,042
Are you just going to look at me?

521
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,988
Stop!
- What happened?

522
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,458
Not that.
- Why?

523
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,394
Chitra said I shouldn't let
you do everything at first.

524
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,062
I should empty your pockets
first and then let you do it.

525
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,132
What?
- No.. nothing.

526
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,262
T.oday, you can just kiss.

527
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,483
Darn that T.engsarkar!
- What have I done?

528
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,493
Nothing. Sit here.

529
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,960
It's T.engsarkar. He takes
wrong decisions at the right time.

530
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,565
Gopal Sharma for Miandad?

531
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,959
If Miandad doesn't
hit him to the clouds..

532
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,038
..then I'll go
right under your legs.

533
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,334
Mine? - I'll thrash you now.

534
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:27,500
A left hander bowler is good
for Miandad. - lsn't it? - Yes.

535
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,636
For instance, Ghavri.

536
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,236
Mohan, enough of your cricket.

537
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,048
Go keep these
lunchboxes at the mill gates.

538
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:33,979
The siren will sound in a moment.

539
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,949
She suits to be
T.engsarkar's mother. - Why?

540
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,214
She takes wrong
decisions at the right time.

541
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,381
Really?
- Yes.

542
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:43,687
But who's this T.engsarkar?
- Get lost, you idiot!

543
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:47,021
Come here. Come here.
- What are you doing, Mohan?

544
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,061
He doesn't know T.engsarkar.

545
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,966
Why don't you say colonel?
- Come here, you idiot.

546
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,333
If I catch you, I'll break your jaw.

547
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,334
Mohan, why are you
behaving like a kid?

548
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,532
Go deliver the lunchboxes.

549
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,974
Naru is sleeping upstairs. Send him.

550
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,705
Would it make
a difference if you go?

551
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,945
Yes! Yes! He hit a six!
Didn't I tell you?

552
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,676
Hey, idiot! You idiot!

553
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,112
He's trying to teach me.
- Why am I speaking to you?

554
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,981
Naru!
- I heard that. I'm coming.

555
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,954
Are you going to look
into the mirror all day?

556
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,158
What's around your neck?

557
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:23,557
Chain.

558
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:24,963
Where did you get it from?

559
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,028
I got my salary.

560
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:31,274
Darn you! There's no
money in the house.

561
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,301
The debtors aren't lending anymore.

562
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:37,039
Why did you buy this chain?
T.o hell with you.

563
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:40,249
It's imitation jewelry from Dubai.

564
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:43,318
And I paid the grocer's debt.

565
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,022
Really?
- Yes.

566
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,687
I gavethe moneyto his son Jignesh.

567
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,027
My good girl.

568
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,399
Learn something from your sister.

569
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,160
Naru!

570
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,028
Give me the lunchboxes.

571
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,708
Hey, are you too smart?

572
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,674
Had you not been elder to me,
I'd have kicked you.

573
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,018
The policewould havetaken
you away again. - Quiet! Quiet!

574
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,314
Naru, what did you do to the police?

575
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,512
Nothing, Mother.

576
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,480
I'd installed the loudspeakers
on Gandhi's birth anniversary.

577
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:22,218
The policetook me because l
didn't taketheir permission.

578
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,218
Idiot!
- Mother, look at him.

579
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:26,455
Idiot!
- I'm going.

580
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,022
Manju, give me my t-shirt.

581
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,491
Here you are.

582
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,195
Mohan, will you go to the grocer?

583
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,566
There you are!
Mohinder saved our pride.

584
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,199
T.o hell with his cricket!

585
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:39,366
Manju.

586
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,570
I'll go myself.

587
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,043
'pakistan lost another wicket.'

588
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,615
'The umpires have declared lunch.'

589
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,686
That doesn't look
like imitation jewelry.

590
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,247
Where would I get
moneyto buy real gold?

591
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,490
The basil plant outside
didn't grow on its own.

592
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,390
You can seethe
basil plant growing up.

593
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,691
Can't you see your sister?
Shameless!

594
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,551
Hey, speed breaker!

595
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,354
What happened to him?

596
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:35,422
Did he fall down?

597
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,701
No, Brother Naru. I
won't do it again.

598
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,036
Wiill you tell me what happened?
Or should I slap you?

599
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,269
Forget it. Father will beat me up.

600
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,567
Hey, what happened to him?

601
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:49,006
He rented a cycle from Ramya's shop.

602
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,039
He took half an hour more.

603
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,681
Ramya bea him up.

604
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:57,049
Don't tell father.
Otherwise, he'll beat me even more.

605
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,146
T.akethese lunchboxes.
- Yes.

606
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,314
Keep them near the mill gates.

607
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,226
You comewith me.
- No. - Come on! - No, brother.

608
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,989
You comewith me.
- No. - Come on! - No, brother.

609
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,527
Go on. What are you looking at?

610
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,032
Meet me in the evening.

611
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,999
Brother Naru.
Brother Naru, forget it.

612
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,271
Brother Naru, let it go.
Listen. Brother Naru. Move!

613
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:16,635
Brother Naru, listen. Brother Naru.

614
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,436
Quiet, otherwise I'll hit you.
- Naru..

615
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:26,340
Hey, Ramya..

616
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,008
What is it, Brother Naru?

617
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,246
What brings you here today?
- Just likethat.

618
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,122
What do you chargeto
rentthe cycle for an hour?

619
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,260
Rs.1. You know that.

620
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,618
What about half an hour?

621
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,320
Fifty paisa.
- Fifty paisa? - Yes.

622
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,597
pakya, come here.

623
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,160
Come quickly.

624
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,167
T.ake this.

625
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,301
Givethe moneyto Ramya.

626
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:55,502
Give it to him.

627
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,938
He rode the cycle half an hour more.

628
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,308
Did you get the money?
- Yes.

629
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,017
Accounts settled?
- Yes.

630
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,386
You broke his nose. What about that?

631
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,219
Brother Naru, he does that everyday.

632
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,551
Brother Naru, don't hit me.

633
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:12,686
You idiot!

634
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:30,408
Brother, let go off him!
please. - No!

635
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,950
Brother Naru, let go offhim!

636
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,687
Brother Naru.
- Get up!

637
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:44,693
This would prove
costlyto you. - Is that so?

638
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,222
How dare you tell methat!
You don't know me.

639
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,695
Look, Naru, this would prove
costly for you. - Is that so?

640
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,704
Brother Naru..

641
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,634
You idiot!

642
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,008
Let him go. Come on.

643
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,946
If you hit my friend again,
I swear I'll chop your hands!

644
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,677
Let him go!
- You can't do anything to me.

645
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,385
pakya!
- Coming!

646
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,423
pakya!
- I'm coming.

647
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:15,549
Where were you?

648
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,355
Where else? T.aking
my father's beaings.

649
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,598
What are you doing?

650
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,097
T.aking a rebound.

651
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,494
T.ake that thumbing.

652
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,968
After taking that coin,
I'll takethis one.

653
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,701
Should I slap you?
Just do as I told you.

654
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,305
Couldn't you make such an easy shot?

655
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,110
My..
- Thumb is weak. - Right.

656
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,276
Brother Naru, give me a sip.

657
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,579
Your nose is broken.
You'll catch cold.

658
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,418
It would stop paining.

659
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,017
T.ake it.

660
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,624
Hey, are you going to play tomorrow?

661
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,288
Just a minute. I'm thinking.

662
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:55,422
He's thinking.

663
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,027
Is this one sip of yours?

664
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:01,701
It was paining a lot.

665
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,397
You fool!

666
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:05,970
Kid.
- Yes.

667
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,101
Get a beer from Milton.

668
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,037
You're not going to play?
Give methe striker.

669
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:11,672
Look atthis cut.

670
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:18,386
Champion.

671
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:19,680
I'll finish the game now. Just wait.

672
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:23,254
Grea. Now take that thumbing.

673
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,393
Do as you wish.

674
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:28,489
There goes the queen.

675
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,271
Who is Naru?
- I am. Why?

676
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:42,369
Brother parsha has called you.

677
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:45,543
Naru, where are you going?

678
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,048
I'll be right back.
pakya, play in my place.

679
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:50,678
Naru.. alone..
where.. - I'll be back.

680
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,549
Speed-breaker, give methe striker.

681
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,025
Bea me up as much as you want.

682
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:06,966
After I leave from here, if
I don't break your bones..

683
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,472
..then I'll die out of shame,
Ramya. You idiot!

684
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,632
Don't you daretouch him.

685
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,604
You are going to die today.
- put some sense into him.

686
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,237
Don't you understand? Idiot!

687
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,483
How dare you!

688
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,487
You idiot!

689
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,493
Hey!

690
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:37,062
Four beaing up one guy.
Fiight one on one.

691
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,226
You idiot!

692
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,270
Hey!

693
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,341
Come here.

694
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,316
Come here, you idiot. Come here.

695
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,345
Come here!

696
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:06,694
Ifl slap you, you'll piss
bucketfuls in your pants.

697
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:10,125
You keep bullying the poor,
Brother parsha.

698
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:16,169
This guy broke his nose and
you have liquor peacefully.

699
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,967
How dare you talk like that to him.

700
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,510
Hey!

701
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,013
Come here.

702
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,683
Come here.

703
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:53,971
What happened?

704
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,571
Brother, they are
very mischievous kids.

705
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,039
Theywould dupe you too.

706
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:04,386
Are you acting smartwith me?
- Brother..

707
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,988
You beat up that kid?
- No,

708
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:11,693
Get going, you idiot!
- No. No. I'm leaving.

709
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,423
If I see you again,

710
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:22,029
What is this? You should
have said that earlier.

711
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,498
You got beaten up unnecessarily.

712
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,038
I have a reputation as well.

713
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,139
I don't bow to anyone.

714
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:37,579
Look. Ifyou need anything,
then just tell me. Okay?

715
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,949
Here. Drink this whiskey.

716
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:45,323
No. I drink only beer.

717
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,222
Darn you!

718
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,026
Hey, open a beer for him.

719
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,691
Brother parsha,
only one? Not for us?

720
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,030
Hey, pakya. Come here.

721
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,583
He fell down!

722
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:09,015
What happened? - What happened?

723
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,654
What happened?

724
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:10,949
What happened?

725
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,957
Everywherethere is globalization.

726
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:15,953
But it's expected
from the mill owners..

727
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,255
..that they should
think about theworkers.

728
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,497
But it's not so easyto close
all mills in quick succession.

729
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,062
Sir, if you think about it,
then everything will be easy.

730
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,461
But..

731
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,974
Hello. - Hello madam, l
am talking from the mill.

732
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,101
Yes, one minute.

733
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,404
Call for you.
- Who is it?

734
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:37,002
From the mill.

735
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:42,009
Hello.
- Sir, an electrician fell down.

736
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,578
Is he dead? - No, sir.
He's suffered a head injury.

737
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:46,951
Workers havetaken
him to the hospital.

738
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:49,951
Okay. We'll see what
has to be donetomorrow.

739
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,961
Okay, sir. - And please
don't disturb me. - Okay, sir.

740
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,064
So, whatwas I saying?
- Globalisation.

741
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,167
Yes, globalisation. For whom?

742
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,630
Only for multinationals?
Let the others die.

743
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:06,505
So you start a
multinational firm. Who stopped you?

744
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,044
Mr. patkar, I spent my
whole life running the mill.

745
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,302
That's my business.

746
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:14,108
Yes, I'm willing to keep
some departments running.

747
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:18,583
I just need your support.
- You have it.

748
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,589
During the previous strike, the
government was with you. - Yes.

749
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,022
What else do you want?

750
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,024
permission to sell the mill land.

751
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,964
Mr. Mahendra, are you
going to let my government..

752
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:29,555
..complete its term?

753
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,567
There's discontent among
the mill workers already.

754
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,334
And ifwe takethis decision,
then everything will be over.

755
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,038
There's a solution.
- What?

756
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,032
Natasha.

757
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:45,048
Mr. patkar, this
is a foolproof plan.

758
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,343
This is the Khaitan mill.

759
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:52,688
A processing unit is located here.

760
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,082
We won't shut it down.

761
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,625
All the other
departments have been shut down.

762
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:57,955
We'll demolish them.

763
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,993
We'll build a huge
shopping mall there.

764
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:05,126
We'll have bowling alleys,
restaurants and multiplexes.

765
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,596
Three towers of 30
floors each will come up here.

766
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,097
Residential towers.

767
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,707
And we'll have
corporate offices here.

768
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:15,975
We'll make lots of
profits from this.

769
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:19,373
And we'll clear the
workers' dues in a snap.

770
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,450
What about the
increase in unemployment?

771
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,620
Sir, theywill get
work on this project.

772
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:27,017
Shopping malls will
need sales boys and girls.

773
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,958
So many families will
shift in thesetowers.

774
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,620
They will need maids
and security guards.

775
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,323
There's enough work, sir.

776
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,594
Let us earn a little.

777
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,628
Elections are approaching.
You'll need money for the party fund.

778
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,997
Mr. Khaitan, your
son-in-law is very smart.

779
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,237
I'm really scared of him.

780
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,410
Why are you joking, sir?

781
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,977
Sir, can I make you a drink?
- Sure. - Just a minute.

782
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:53,548
Let's continue at the pool side.

783
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,542
Brilliant. Let's go.

784
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:57,210
I'll just join you.
- Sure.

785
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,283
Come on, let's go. - Yes.

786
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,020
Who's with your wife?

787
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,027
Relative?

788
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:12,024
Dessert for you. After dinner.

789
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:14,063
Let's have dinner.
- please, sir.

790
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,508
I am not going to spare
him today. I'll thrash him.

791
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:23,612
Govind, let go!

792
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:26,316
Let go!
- Who does he think he is?

793
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,041
Got 25 stitches on his head.

794
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:29,483
Two fractures in the leg.
One in the hand.

795
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,314
Waman won't be ableto
work for six months.

796
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:32,615
Did he give Rs.10000 as alms?

797
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,389
Why did he climb up
in a drunken state?

798
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:35,549
Waman wasn't drunk.

799
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:36,954
Should I show you
the hospital report?

800
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:39,392
The idiot paid money and got
a report made that suits him.

801
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:40,689
Rane, he's crossing his limits.

802
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:42,022
What can you do?

803
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:43,390
Govind, come on.

804
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:47,036
Mr. Mahendra, you'll have to
increase the compensation.

805
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,172
It can't be done. - Then
we'll haveto go to labour court.

806
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,269
As you wish.
- Oh, really?

807
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:53,643
Why are you arguing with him?

808
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:55,974
So get out.
- Hey! - Govind. Govind.

809
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,205
If I find you alone outside..

810
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,147
..I'll strip you naked and make
you beg atthetraffic signals.

811
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,480
Govind, let it go.
Comewith me. Come on.

812
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,077
He's saying we should go out.

813
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:05,450
Idiot, I'll do him in..
- Govind! Govind!

814
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,687
Come on.
- You stopped me unnecessarily.

815
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,004
Here's the money.

816
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:32,672
Sign here.

817
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,577
You'll be in deep trouble sometime.

818
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:38,250
What happened? - I gave you Rs.
200. And you wrote Rs.2000.

819
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,454
Now sign.
- You aretoo much.

820
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,030
Why are you so
engrossed in this match?

821
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,959
It's the last over ofthe day.
70 runs are needed.

822
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,636
If Mohinder remains not out,
we'll win the match tomorrow.

823
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,295
You're mad about cricket.
Here, do it.

824
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,400
Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

825
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:01,142
What's wrong with you?
- We've lost the match.

826
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,380
He's a fool.. - What was the need
to drive on the second last ball?

827
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:08,017
India will win.
- What nonsense!

828
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:10,016
There's hardly anybody left to bat.
- Yet lndiawill win.

829
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,555
How? - I'll tell you if
you trea me to a beer.

830
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:17,491
Where's my beer? - Forget that.
T.ell me how lndiawill win.

831
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:21,690
What do I tell you?
The match is fixed.

832
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:26,095
Meaning? - Listen, the odds on
pakistan are 15 to one (48:48).

833
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,570
The odds on lndia are 8 to one.

834
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,969
Who will everybody bet on? pakistan.

835
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:36,645
Indiawill win. The
bookies will make a lot ofmoney.

836
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:40,345
Dinkar, what's all
that about 'odds'?

837
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:47,953
Listen, if you bet a rupee on
lndia and lndia happens to win..

838
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:50,686
..then you will get Rs.8.

839
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:53,958
What if I bet Rs.100?
- Rs.800.

840
00:48:54,464 --> 00:49:02,496
Oh, my God. What if I bet Rs.25,000?

841
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,434
Naru's mother! Naru's mother!

842
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:11,942
Naru's mother! Naru's mother!

843
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:13,209
What's wrong? - The police
have come to your place.

844
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:14,341
What?
- What?

845
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,009
Yes, there outside.

846
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,225
What happened?
- Is Mohan your son?

847
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:25,354
Yes. - He has committed
fraud of Rs.25,000 at the bank.

848
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:29,023
Oh, my God. - The case
hasn't been registered yet.

849
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:31,967
Sir has asked you to pay
Rs.25,000 and get your son released.

850
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,226
Dislile Road police station.

851
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:39,967
What do we do now?
- Your family is ruined.

852
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,344
It's my ill luck that I was
born in this family. - Listen..

853
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:48,942
Mother, what are you doing?
- pakya, what happened?

854
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:51,277
The policewere here.
- What are you doing?

855
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,019
We need to do something.

856
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:02,228
Naru's mother. Here's Rs.2000.

857
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:17,940
Come on.
- Should I come along?

858
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:21,474
I mean I am not feeling well.

859
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:26,421
The men in the Dhuri
family are cowards.

860
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:30,625
Come on, Manju.
- No. That's not case.

861
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:32,695
I will come ifthe need arises.

862
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:36,964
Sir, here's some money and jewelry.

863
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:38,964
Madam, what do I do about it?

864
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,967
At the most, this could
be Rs.5000 to Rs.6000.

865
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,096
What about the rest of the money?

866
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:48,172
I'll pay it in installments.
We always pay our dues.

867
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,940
Listen, the bank
manager is a good man.

868
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:53,945
That's the reason he
hasn't filed a case yet.

869
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:57,477
I won't be ableto help you at
all ifyou don't get Rs.25000.

870
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:02,024
Sir, father's gratuity
money is due in a few days.

871
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,023
I'll give it to you oncewe get it.

872
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,624
Mohan isn't a bad guy.
- I never said he's bad.

873
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:16,033
But I can't help you. Listen, go
talk to the bank manager once.

874
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:20,704
Useless man.

875
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,021
Mohan. Mohan.

876
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:48,361
Mother. Mohan.

877
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:52,972
So, the police released you.
- Not just like that.

878
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,443
I paid Rs.25,000.
- Where did you get the money from?

879
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:57,604
What have you got to do with it?

880
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:04,347
I owed you for being born
in this family. I repaid it.

881
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:10,356
Are you going to
remain outside? Come in.

882
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:19,691
I am going out for ten days.
T.o write a play.

883
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,969
Don't creaetroubletill I return.

884
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:39,950
Mother, l..

885
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,968
Mother. - Mother! Idiot. -
What are you doing, Lakshmi?

886
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,561
Why are you avenging your mother?

887
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,168
You made your mother go to
the police station. - Mother!

888
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,639
You made your mother go
to the police station.

889
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,004
Stop it, Mother. - ldiot.

890
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,946
Mother, stop it now..
- ldiot!

891
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,950
Stop it, Mother. Stop it.

892
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:10,952
Leave me! Because ofyou,
I had to suffer..

893
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:12,681
Mother.. Mother, stop it.

894
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,254
You had promised me you won't..

895
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,156
Stop it, Mother!
- Move! Move!

896
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:21,697
Mother..
- Leave me!

897
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:24,558
What are you doing?
- Let him die!

898
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,950
Don't touch me.
- I made a mistake.

899
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,954
Won't you forgive your mother?

900
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,358
You asked meto go die.

901
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:34,961
Yes, I'll do that.
- I was angry at you.

902
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:40,974
Who do I have besides my children?

903
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:50,010
I beat you a lot. Why
didn't I hold myselfback..

904
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:57,288
I hit you a lot.

905
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,501
Mohan is naive.

906
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:12,972
He thought he could get me
married if he got some money.

907
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,545
But he's unlucky.
- Yes.

908
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:23,948
Mohan wants to do something
and something else happens.

909
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:31,683
He's lost his job. I
wonder what he's going to do.

910
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:37,359
Forget Mohan.
- Wait.

911
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,964
Have you got it?
- It spoils the fun.

912
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,368
No. What ifsomething goes wrong?

913
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,701
I am with you. Don't worry.

914
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:51,544
But you'll marry me if
something goes wrong, won't you?

915
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:55,948
Yes. I love you.
- Wait. Wait.

916
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,953
What happened now?
- Switch off the light.

917
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:01,689
Let it be.
- No. I feel shy.

918
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:13,361
Gloryto Lord Dattatray!

919
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:17,964
Gloryto Lord Dattatray!

920
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:24,339
"Shirdi is like pandharpur to me."

921
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,080
"Sai Baba lives there."

922
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,947
"Sai Baba lives there."

923
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:35,685
Chandra Bhaga and brother
pundlik also live there.

924
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:41,086
Brother pundlik also lives there.

925
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:46,567
Everyone come and take Sai
Baba's blessings. -Father. Father.

926
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,968
Father, come home.
Mother's bleeding from the mouth.

927
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:55,443
Everyone come and take
Sai Baba's blessings.

928
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,945
Listen, get the doctor along.

929
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:13,360
Father, mother won't die, right?

930
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,294
Come, dear. Comewith me.

931
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:17,958
Aunt.. -I'll give
you something to eat.

932
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:33,477
Babu has gone to get the doctor.

933
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:37,678
Should I call for an ambulance?
- No.

934
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,946
Everything will be all right, Kashi.

935
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,956
She'll be free ifshe dies.

936
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:52,559
Brother, Ghanshyam turned out to
be courageous. Very courageous.

937
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:55,636
That's because
Anwar's supporting him.

938
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,969
Shoot him in the leg.
- Let's shoot him in the head.

939
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:01,976
No. Shoot him in the leg.

940
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:04,009
If he gets killed, it
will be a police case.

941
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:10,348
Wait. T.akethis.
- Is that gun real?

942
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:13,354
No. It's atoy, hero.

943
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:21,095
Not hero, my name's Speed Breaker.
- Speed breaker?

944
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:24,165
What are you looking at? T.ake it.

945
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,697
But I don't know how to use it.

946
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:27,625
Have I learned at birth?

947
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:32,504
Look, hold it this way. Aim,
and then pull the trigger.

948
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:41,945
Here.
- Let's go. - Come on.

949
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:44,944
Come here.
- Yes.

950
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:52,952
It's 10,000. - 10.. - Look,
he's yet to come to terms with it.

951
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,972
You know what it is, don't you?
- Gun.

952
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:09,943
It's not atoy. Look.
- What's that?

953
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,009
'Goli' (bullet).
- 'Goli'?

954
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,142
That's not meantto be eaen.

955
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,079
Where do you put the bullets?
- Look, there's a hole.

956
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:24,956
Yes. - put the bullets in
the hole and then close it.

957
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,494
It's called 'Ghoda' (gun).

958
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,089
So, the onewho runs at
the beach is a donkey.

959
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,224
Stop your nonsense.

960
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:54,550
Where are you off to?
- I'll come along.

961
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:55,954
Am I offto a marriage shoot?

962
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,028
Go and order fortwo bottles
of liquor.. I'll come. Let's go.

963
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:03,362
L.p. Laxmikant pyarelal.

964
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:07,036
"When one can't.."

965
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:07,370
Ghanshyam sir, how are you?

966
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,099
Ghanshyam sir, how are you?

967
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,298
He has done so manythings for us.

968
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,238
So, I haveto do
something for Him too.

969
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:17,074
You don't have the
moneyto payto parsha.

970
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:19,942
I'll come.
- I'll deliver itthe next week.

971
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:22,609
The others' too would delay,
if I give aweek to you.

972
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:27,019
You explain it to him.
T.ell him not to do this.

973
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:30,217
What are you doing? Listen to me.

974
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:32,089
What are you doing?

975
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,102
Sister-in-law Chhaya, how are you?
- I'm good.

976
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:51,941
Come on.

977
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:56,318
Keep it there, be quick.

978
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,953
So, how are you, Mother lndia?

979
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,516
What have you brought, Naru?

980
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,984
Not much. Some breakfast for all.

981
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,987
What have you done?
- Nothing illegal.

982
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,529
It's my hard earned money, Mother.

983
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:13,625
Where's father?
- He must be outsidethe mill.

984
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:15,704
He must be gambling.
- No problem.

985
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:23,075
pakya, give. This is
quarter for the old man. English.

986
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,609
Naru, I hope you
haven't committed atheft.

987
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:31,951
No, Mother. I have found my calling.

988
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:33,953
Look, stop your
catering service now.

989
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:37,691
Go to the Lord Ganesha pilgrimage
the next week with father.

990
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:43,694
I'll sponsor thetrip.
Here..here's the money.

991
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:47,995
Naru, tell methetruth. You aren't
doing anything illegal, are you?

992
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:50,470
No, Mother. Go make tea. Go.
- You aren't lying, are you?

993
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:53,565
Offer the money to God
first then. Keep it.

994
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,500
Lord, You have blessed my son.
- Thank You, Mr. God.

995
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:56,942
You have blessed us.

996
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:58,573
Listen, have you seen Mohan around?

997
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:00,949
Mohan is at the neighbor's house..

998
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,211
..with his sponsor. Mr. Savardekar.

999
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,951
Oh, God. These children
are hardly ever at home.

1000
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,648
One is always at his aunt's house.

1001
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:10,959
It's been a month.

1002
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,426
And I wonder what the other one
keeps writing. He hasn't come back.

1003
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:16,259
You don't worry now. Look,
I'll sponsor his play now.

1004
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:21,161
Dear. Listen, get a job for Mohan.

1005
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:23,036
I'll send Mohan to Dubai.

1006
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:23,506
First, send Shinde who lives
in room number 15 to heaven.

1007
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,633
First, send Shinde who lives
in room number 15 to heaven.

1008
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,506
Why? What has he done?
- What has he done?

1009
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,208
Go maketea, please. - ldiots.
- Let metell you what happened.

1010
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:34,474
I asked him to give me
Rs.11 for Lord Shiva festival.

1011
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:41,020
He said he would slap me 11 times.
He insulted Shivaji.

1012
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:44,616
He's right. Wherewill a
poor man get Rs.11 from for you?

1013
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:46,627
So, should we cancel Lord
Shiva festival celebrations?

1014
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:47,957
Not at all.

1015
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,964
That's the only festival
a Marathi man celebrates.

1016
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,557
Why should we cancel it?
- What do we do now?

1017
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:55,435
Listen, get money
from the shopkeepers.

1018
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,368
I'll pay if it falls short.
I'll sponsor it.

1019
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:00,033
We'll watch 'Amar

Who stars in it?
- Amitabh Bachpan.

1021
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:05,610
Amitabh Gachpan too stars in it?
- Yes.

1022
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:08,275
'The policewill
banish you from the city.'

1023
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:13,622
'I'll makethis place mine.
Anthony Lane.' 'T.ell me. Am I right?'

1024
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:15,421
'Come on, get the money.'

1025
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:17,682
'You want meto pay you?'
- He's good, isn't he?

1026
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:20,622
'I'll make even your father
pay.' -Manda. Come downstairs.

1027
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:23,028
I'm tired. I'll go to sleep now.

1028
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:27,034
Amitabh Bachchan's on
the screen. He's too good.

1029
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,702
Uncle, should we stop the show?

1030
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:32,372
We'll watch your love story.

1031
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:36,303
Shut up. Idiot.
- You won't reform, you oldie.

1032
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,337
Do your work, you fool.

1033
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:41,414
Come on, dance!

1034
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:48,281
"I've fallen in love with you.'

1035
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:54,689
Uncle!
- Look, he's dancing. -Uncle!

1036
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,488
Shut up. -Amitabh.

1037
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:10,404
I'll slap you.

1038
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:20,349
Shut up. Watch the movie.

1039
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,163
Oh, God. Who did that?

1040
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:41,633
Uncle Shire, thatwas horrible.
You have had rotten eggs it seems.

1041
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:43,069
Shut up.

1042
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:53,418
Where are you offto, Mohan?

1043
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,547
T.o the toilet.
- Go behind the tenement.

1044
01:04:56,993 --> 01:05:00,087
I'm an educated man. I don't
indulge in nonsense like you all.

1045
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:02,687
Keep watching the movie.
- 'So, T.ayyab Ali?' - Giveway.

1046
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:05,961
'You got my friend
Akbar beaen up by goons.'

1047
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,626
'T.ell me. Yes or no?'

1048
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,570
Brother Naru, Mohan
has gone upstairs.

1049
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,709
Upstairs.
- What have you got to do with it?

1050
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,978
She too has gone inside.
- Shut up.

1051
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:20,344
You too want to go?
- No.

1052
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:23,412
Then shut up and watch the movie.

1053
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:29,088
I can see my hand.

1054
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:30,215
'police. Call up the police.'

1055
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,954
It is nice.
- 'What are you staring at?

1056
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:35,496
Call the police.' 'police. police!'

1057
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:52,942
What are you doing?
Are you wrestling with me?

1058
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:54,676
Removethe clothes.

1059
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:58,487
Wait. It will tear. Wait.

1060
01:05:58,587 --> 01:05:59,679
I'll buy you a new one.

1061
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:04,288
Come here.
- Why are you in such a hurry

1062
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:14,431
Mohan. Mohan.

1063
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:21,971
What are you doing? It's hurting.

1064
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:26,675
Mohan.. Mohan. - Wait a minute.

1065
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,349
I can't hold myself back now.
I havewaited long enough.

1066
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:30,942
It's been 12 years to my marriage.

1067
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,952
Mohan. Mohan, I want a baby.

1068
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:38,959
I am tired ofbeing abused.

1069
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:41,962
They don't invite meto venerations.

1070
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,098
Not to functions too.

1071
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:47,962
They keep me away since
I can't beget a child.

1072
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:54,033
I'd been to my sister's
daughter's naming ceremony.

1073
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:55,972
I kissed the baby on her cheek..

1074
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:59,605
..and my sister slapped
me hard across my face.

1075
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:04,953
My husband is a good man.

1076
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:11,148
But God isn't
always kind to good men.

1077
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:15,291
Therefore, I want a baby.

1078
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,234
What happened, Manju?
- Nothing.

1079
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:32,337
I had fritters. That
affected me adversely.

1080
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:34,547
You've been puking since yesterday.

1081
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:36,944
I had the fritters yesterday.

1082
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:39,545
Manju.

1083
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:47,963
I would have been a mother of five..

1084
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,032
..had one child not
died upon its birth.

1085
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:55,029
I'm not educated, but I'm wise.

1086
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,232
Don't talk rubbish, Mother.

1087
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:01,033
The cloth wasn't hung on
the ropethe last month.

1088
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:04,275
The menstrual cycle does
get delayed sometimes.

1089
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,007
The doctor had said that.
- Which doctor?

1090
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:10,352
Well.. Aslani. Aslani told me.

1091
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:12,011
Come. Comewith me. -No.

1092
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:16,217
the dispensary must be closed now.
- Manju!

1093
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:22,225
Mother.? -Listen..
Manju, I'm worried now.

1094
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:25,967
T.ell methetruth. Swear on
God and tell methetruth.

1095
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,962
No, Mother.
- Who did you sleep with?

1096
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:31,503
T.ell me. Have you gone mute?

1097
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:34,236
Who did you sleep with?
- No, Mother..

1098
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:40,414
Who is he? T.ell me. Who is he?
Who is he? - Jignesh.

1099
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:44,346
Jignesh? Who?
- The shopkeeper's son.

1100
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:47,149
Oh, my God. What are you saying,
Naru's mother?

1101
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:50,483
Jignesh is a married man. He
got married five years ago.

1102
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:54,952
He's goneto Rajkot
to get his wife here..

1103
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:56,554
..as she turned 17 recently.

1104
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:58,565
His in-laws are very strict.

1105
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:01,498
Ifthey cometo know about this,
we will be ruined.

1106
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:03,299
Do something, Naru's mother.

1107
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,100
No. I won't do that.
- What are you going to do then?

1108
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:08,972
Go about being an
illegitimate child's mother.

1109
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:11,940
Let Jignesh come. He'd
promised to marry me.

1110
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,607
He's already married. He's
goneto get his wife back.

1111
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:17,015
You are lying. Let's
wait till he returns. - No.

1112
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:20,416
You want your pregnancy to be
visible in a couple of months?

1113
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:21,683
No mother. -Manju..

1114
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:24,617
Manju, what have you done.
- Listen to me..

1115
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:27,491
What have you done? - Listen
to me.. - Move. - Listen to me..

1116
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:29,291
Let it be. It's nothing.
- What did I hear?

1117
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:33,191
I'm talking to her..
Don't beat her. - T.ell.

1118
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:35,164
Move!
- Don't beat her.

1119
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:38,638
She has disgraced us.
- I haven't done anything wrong.

1120
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:40,538
Mohan! Mohan!

1121
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:44,379
Leave me! Don't interfere!

1122
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,215
Leave me! Leave me!

1123
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:55,113
I'll burn her to deah!

1124
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:58,118
I won't go! Set me afire. Do it.

1125
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:56,705
Listen. Listen.

1126
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,080
Mohan. Listen to father.

1127
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,342
What do you want?
- Water. I need water.

1128
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:04,609
He wants water.
- Give it to him then.

1129
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,951
What are you telling me for?
- T.ake water, Father.

1130
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:10,685
Why are you shouting?
- Why don't you give it to him?

1131
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:14,019
Mother, you don't understand. He
should get used to getting up.

1132
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:15,693
How will he recover otherwise?

1133
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:20,965
Rajesh Khanna, don't get up now.
I'll get water for you.

1134
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:32,471
Mother, stop that noise. I'm
not being able to write a word.

1135
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:35,347
Go write at a place
devoid of any noise.

1136
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:37,679
It's futile telling you.
- Slowly..

1137
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:45,217
Anand. - Uncle Rane.
Mother, uncle Rane's here.

1138
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:47,420
Welcome.
- Hey, get up.

1139
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:53,694
Where are you off to now? -
Where can I go? T.o the neighborhood.

1140
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:55,160
Welcome. - Hello.

1141
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:57,363
No master, don't get up.

1142
01:12:58,607 --> 01:12:59,631
What made you come
here all of a sudden?

1143
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:01,232
I hadn't met master.

1144
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:04,474
Govind, take a seat.
- Who's he?

1145
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:07,615
He's Govind Rahate. We
both work for the union.

1146
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:10,952
He stays close by at..
Rangari Badak tenement.

1147
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,146
Is it?
- Yes. - Hello.

1148
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:17,619
Hello. My son knows you.
- Is it? Who?

1149
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:21,958
His name is Ganpat. They
call him.. Speed Breaker.

1150
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:25,223
Oh, you are Ganya's father.
- Yes.

1151
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:29,033
Be seated. I'll get tea. Manju,
givethem water.

1152
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:34,175
Master, how are you?

1153
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:37,268
The gate-meeting isn't
the same in your absence.

1154
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:44,085
Recover quickly.
- Yes. We haveto fight it out now.

1155
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:47,685
What can we do ifyou keep unwell?
- Water. - Yes.

1156
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:04,966
Manju has really grown up.
- Yes. She has.

1157
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:10,609
I am unwell, and on top of that,
the gratuity money hasn't come yet.

1158
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:18,215
Mohan lost his job.
Manju has grown up.

1159
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:25,087
Master, everything will
be all right. Don't cry.

1160
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:31,090
Don't cry.
- Can I tell you something, Rane?

1161
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,360
Yes, tell me.

1162
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:39,969
Once she gets married, I'll be free.

1163
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,958
The groom and the bride
should garland each other now.

1164
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:16,636
Tiiethe nuptial
necklace to the bride.

1165
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:26,019
"Cometo the cross road and
see whose husband is coming."

1166
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:30,558
"Cometo the cross road and
see whose husband is coming."

1167
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:34,356
"Cometo the cross road and
see whose husband is coming."

1168
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:42,030
Sorry. I couldn't be home
earlier on the nuptial night.

1169
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:46,036
I have two wives.

1170
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:53,013
One is you and the other, the union.

1171
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:56,143
The doctor arranged
a gate-meeting today.

1172
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:01,211
Checking the papers, files,
agreements..

1173
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:03,622
Sorry. I apologizeto you again.

1174
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:08,292
You must be hungry, right?
- I had dinner.

1175
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:13,963
Okay. That's good.
- Should I serve food to you?

1176
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:18,706
No. I had fritters near the mill.

1177
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:21,032
The doctor has arranged
for the gate-meeting..

1178
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:22,167
..again for tomorrow morning.

1179
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:27,010
The doctor keeps asking about me.

1180
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:33,019
You look good in that green sari.

1181
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,223
I wanted to tell you something.
- What?

1182
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:41,029
I had an affair beforethe marriage.

1183
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:46,030
And l..
- Master had told me.

1184
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,634
Yet you married me.

1185
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:50,562
You were generous.

1186
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:54,174
You must havethought you
did a favor to me, isn't it?

1187
01:16:55,544 --> 01:17:01,483
No, that's not the case.
What do you mean by that?

1188
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:04,483
Nothing. I want to
tell you something.

1189
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:13,960
I had decided I would die out of
hunger, without getting married..

1190
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:15,962
..but I won't marry a mill worker.

1191
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:24,971
All my mother has
experienced in her life is..

1192
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:32,673
..poverty, stress, two square
meals and a child everytwo years.

1193
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:41,945
Ever since I was sensible enough..

1194
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:44,958
..I've seen herworking hard,
dying a slow death.

1195
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:48,960
T.oday, I have
suffered the same fate.

1196
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:56,363
My heartwould pound
upon hearing the mill siren.

1197
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:01,965
I will haveto get
accustomed to it now.

1198
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:08,944
Don't keep staring at me.
Switch off the light.

1199
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:11,675
And get done with what one
does after marriage. Be quick.

1200
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,148
You might have a
gate-meeting to attend.

1201
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:16,156
I too have to go to the parlor.

1202
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:29,966
Saw that? A lovely strike.

1203
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:31,437
Will you be able to finish the game?

1204
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:36,568
Wait. T.ake that one first. Good.

1205
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:39,947
Not that, take this one. The queen.

1206
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:43,142
Uncle, am I a fool? I
understand the game.

1207
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:45,950
play. play the way you want to.

1208
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:48,215
Don't listen to him.

1209
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:53,217
I had told you. - Sorry. Sorry.

1210
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:54,556
You didn't hear it, didn't you?

1211
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,961
Uncle, come home for lunch.

1212
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,694
It's the last board. We
need five points to win.

1213
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:02,500
Go for lunch. I'll play
the game on your behalf.

1214
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:07,303
You do that everyday.
- What did you say?

1215
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,934
Nothing.
- Don't get on my nerves.

1216
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:12,342
Whywould l? Brother Naru.

1217
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:16,474
What's up, Naru sir?
What's wrong with him?

1218
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:20,688
Forget it. Go for lunch.
- What about you?

1219
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:22,080
I have already had lunch.

1220
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:26,960
"Oh, Basanti.."

1221
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:35,298
Naru, where were you
the last two days?

1222
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:37,564
You are here in time
for lunch. Come on.

1223
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:46,204
What happened, Naru?

1224
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:49,348
Brother, where did
you get Rs.25,000 from?

1225
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:51,209
25,000? What?

1226
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:54,214
Where did you get the
moneyto bail out Mohan from?

1227
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:58,957
What have you gotto do
with it? Do your work.

1228
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:04,096
You idiot! - Have you
gone mad? Have you gone mad?

1229
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:08,101
I am mad? The idiot sold
off his kidney for Rs.25,000.

1230
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:13,505
What? What did you do..
- Don't spare him! - He's lying.

1231
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:16,634
I am lying! Vijay is a
ward-boy at Rade hospital.

1232
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:18,076
You were admitted there
for 15 days, weren't you?

1233
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:23,946
Oh, God. Why? What have you done?

1234
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:26,953
Nothing will happen. One
kidney is enough to live.

1235
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:29,080
You should havetold me! I
would've arranged for the money!

1236
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:31,557
Did you? Did you get the moneythen?

1237
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,493
Did anyone arrange for it? - Father?

1238
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:37,563
Leave me. - Everybodywants to
do something for the family.

1239
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:39,956
I too feel like it. Got it?

1240
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:41,160
I too feel for the family.

1241
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:44,500
I don't earn.

1242
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:51,410
But what do I do?
people don't buy my plays.

1243
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:56,480
So.. so I sold it.

1244
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:12,090
What have done?

1245
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:22,102
Hi, Dad. What made you
come here all of a sudden?

1246
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:25,610
I had to, Son. What are you doing?

1247
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:30,481
We had decided not to wind up
the weaving department, hadn't we?

1248
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:32,476
Yet you gave the machines away.

1249
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:34,417
Dad, it was important
to take that decision.

1250
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:35,954
Do you realize the consequences?

1251
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:38,952
Whatever the consequences be,
they'll be good for us.

1252
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:41,428
Son, the workers have got violent.

1253
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:44,154
They'll be violent for a few days.

1254
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:46,962
But they'll try to
dictate terms if..

1255
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:48,160
..We don't take such
a strong decision.

1256
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,503
It's necessaryto scare them.

1257
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:53,107
Onlythen will they
agree for a compromise.

1258
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:57,003
But Son.. - Chill, Dad.
Let me make you a drink.

1259
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:01,139
We'll find away out.

1260
01:22:04,986 --> 01:22:07,420
Rane, are you going to remain quiet?

1261
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:08,954
Theworkers will go hungry..

1262
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,150
..but there'll be no
further discussions with him.

1263
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:15,090
Rane, such an
extreme stand isn't good.

1264
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,428
You too are favoring them, sir?

1265
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:21,032
You too were a
worker once. Forgot that?

1266
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:22,496
What do you want me to do then?

1267
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:24,698
We have onlytwo demands.

1268
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:28,968
Start all the
departments in the mill..

1269
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:30,203
..and get theworkers their dues.

1270
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:31,676
Both your demands
shall be fulfilled.

1271
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:35,540
But you'll haveto
take a step back for that.

1272
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:38,481
Meaning? - The workers
should get all their dues.

1273
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:43,089
No compromise. But Khaitan
sir is in trouble. - Yes.

1274
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:44,956
Give the no objection certificate..

1275
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,960
..to sell some
part of the mill land.

1276
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:50,220
He'll immediately honor
all the dues oftheworkers.

1277
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:51,560
I promise.

1278
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:01,097
But all the departments
should get started tomorrow.

1279
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:03,710
T.omorrow? Right away.
T.onight. In thethird shift.

1280
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,007
Long live! - Arvind Rane!

1281
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:08,674
Long live! - Worker's Union!

1282
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:14,012
Long live! - Arvind Rane!
Long live! - Worker's Union!

1283
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:19,025
Long live! - Arvind Rane!

1284
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:22,493
Have SWeets

1285
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:23,689
Have SWeets.
- Remember!

1286
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:26,631
This has happened only
because of Arvind sir!

1287
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:28,703
Yes!
- But where's Arvind Rane?

1288
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:30,970
He's goneto the court.

1289
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:33,973
He'll be here any moment now. What?
Look there he is!

1290
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:37,075
Hail Arvind Rane!

1291
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:42,206
Long live! - Worker's Union!

1292
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:44,478
Hail Arvind Rane!

1293
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:47,350
Hail Arvind Rane! -Enough. Enough.

1294
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,217
Where's Govind Rahate, Rane sir?

1295
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:51,155
The papers weren't
readywith the advocate.

1296
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:53,954
I told him to wait there.
T.o getthe papers along.

1297
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:57,156
Hail Arvind Rane!
- Enough. Enough.

1298
01:23:57,265 --> 01:23:59,290
Why are you standing out?
Why didn't you all go in?

1299
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:04,964
The gate hasn't opened yet.
- It hasn't?

1300
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:08,103
Where's the watchman?
- He hasn't come.

1301
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:15,941
Watchman. Watchman.

1302
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:42,100
Deceit! They have deceived us!

1303
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:28,554
Sumi! Sumi! Sumi! Sumi!

1304
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:31,082
Sumi! Whatg happened?

1305
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:38,561
'Hamida. My best friend Hamida.'

1306
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:41,635
'The lock-out wasn't
called off. Itwill, today.'

1307
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:44,967
'lt will, tomorrow. Six
months went by in that manner.'

1308
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,967
'The mills were
closing down one-by-one.'

1309
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:48,969
'lt was being brought down.'

1310
01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:52,672
'The reason I'm writing a letter
is to tell you that I am fine.'

1311
01:25:54,115 --> 01:26:00,350
'The childhood memories, that
taste oftamarind lingers on.'

1312
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:06,957
'l know you were jealous of
me during my engagement..'

1313
01:26:07,061 --> 01:26:13,967
'..when you heard that I would
go to Mumbai after marriage.'

1314
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:20,975
'l always lied to you
that I stay in a palace.'

1315
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:29,081
'ln a room smaller than our
bathroom, I die a slow death.'

1316
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:37,489
'The paltry income of my
husband would hardly suffice.'

1317
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:45,032
'But money was required to
carry out menial tasks.'

1318
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:52,965
'It's been four months since
my children went to school.'

1319
01:26:54,742 --> 01:27:01,409
'No fees, no food.. I
don't know what to do.'

1320
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:07,285
'After all these years, l
pitythose cockroaches.'

1321
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:15,629
'l have realised how
horriblethe insecticidetastes.'

1322
01:27:17,131 --> 01:27:19,099
'l really have.'

1323
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:24,099
'The reason I'm writing a letter
is to tell you that I am fine.'

1324
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:27,965
'Suffering through all that..'

1325
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:31,273
'..theworkers had the
support of Dr. Aaba Sawant.'

1326
01:27:31,713 --> 01:27:34,944
'Dr. Aaba Sawant was
reading the paper..

1327
01:27:35,049 --> 01:27:36,482
..Iike hewould usually, that day.'

1328
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:39,086
'All of a sudden, there
was a cylinder explosion.'

1329
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:44,353
'Nobody knew if itwas an
accident or a planned move.'

1330
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,950
'But theworker was stunned.'

1331
01:27:48,329 --> 01:27:50,354
Shirya, where are you
offto hiding the stove?

1332
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:53,624
No, I'm not hiding it. I'm
taking it to get it repaired.

1333
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,026
What will you cook on it?

1334
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:58,230
'Selling the stove, utensils.
Selling everything in house..'

1335
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:02,968
'Selling even the copper
and metal in the wires..'

1336
01:28:03,077 --> 01:28:05,341
'..theworker survived.'

1337
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:09,013
'Finally, therewas
nothing left to be sold.'

1338
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:17,549
'Or something was left. Yes,
something was left.'

1339
01:28:33,007 --> 01:28:37,671
Do you have a cigarette?
- No. The packet's empty.

1340
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:47,477
Forget it. It's past midnight.
Let's go sleep.

1341
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:51,547
Wait, Shirya. The
children must still be awake.

1342
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:54,691
I told them I would
get something for dinner.

1343
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:58,562
I survived the day.
- How?

1344
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:02,431
I went to mywife's younger sister.

1345
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:06,969
Shewas very angry.
I acted shameless.

1346
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:11,407
I left only after lunch.
- That's great. You're lucky.

1347
01:29:13,981 --> 01:29:16,950
How much? - Rs. 10. - T.ake this.

1348
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:38,697
Shirya. - Yes? - Where does Sangeeta
go to work so late at night?

1349
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:45,544
Work? What nonsense!
She sells her body.

1350
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:56,014
Not even the vegetable-seller
gives my wife a look.

1351
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:05,965
Come on. Let's go home. I'm scared.
- Why be scared?

1352
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:09,434
'The situation of the
workers was terrifying..'

1353
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:15,974
'..and that of their children,
a lot more terrifying.'

1354
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:24,946
What happened?

1355
01:30:25,052 --> 01:30:27,953
Nothing. I've been doing
the rounds since an hour.

1356
01:30:28,055 --> 01:30:29,079
My legs are really hurting.

1357
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:33,688
What else will an unlucky man do?

1358
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:35,695
Ask pandu. Look, he's here.

1359
01:30:36,397 --> 01:30:40,231
Hi, pakya.
- What happened to your hand?

1360
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:42,959
My father bit me.

1361
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:46,300
Your father?
- He's heavily drunk.

1362
01:30:46,674 --> 01:30:47,971
He told mother to serve him food.

1363
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:49,706
How could shewhen
there is nothing to ea?

1364
01:30:50,244 --> 01:30:51,939
So, father slapped
her across her face.

1365
01:30:52,313 --> 01:30:55,146
I lost it. I hit him on his face.

1366
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:59,083
You father? - I would have killed
him, had my mother not stopped me.

1367
01:30:59,654 --> 01:31:05,957
He's right. "Nothing to ea,
nobodyto turn to."

1368
01:31:06,194 --> 01:31:10,358
What about you? - Nothing.
Not even a dog has passed by.

1369
01:31:10,598 --> 01:31:12,691
Great. We haveto
go hungry todaytoo.

1370
01:31:13,201 --> 01:31:18,036
The stomach is burning.
- Hang on.

1371
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,971
There's away.

1372
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:28,472
Come on.

1373
01:31:36,724 --> 01:31:39,352
So, useless fellows.
What's the time?

1374
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:41,695
Have your parents thrown you out?

1375
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:44,959
Thrown us out? They
repent giving us birth.

1376
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:46,294
Who wouldn't repent?

1377
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,699
Drunkard, give me
Rs.40 for scrambled eggs?

1378
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:51,965
Is it your father's money, you fool?

1379
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:54,234
please give us. You have
moneyto splurge on drinks.

1380
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:58,069
Listen, don't touch my pocket.
I'll beat you up otherwise.

1381
01:31:58,246 --> 01:32:02,546
Fool, give him since he asks.
- You called me a fool?

1382
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:04,014
You idiot!

1383
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:12,087
Hit him! Hit him! - Hit him!

1384
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:19,361
Hit him hard!

1385
01:32:20,067 --> 01:32:27,030
Hit him! Come on! Hit him!

1386
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:42,948
Wait. I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

1387
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:44,217
I'll be right back.

1388
01:32:54,268 --> 01:32:56,702
What are you looking at? You idiot!

1389
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:03,073
What are you staring at?
Is it mywedding? Let's go.

1390
01:33:03,277 --> 01:33:07,145
How much money does it have.
- There was only Rs.40 in his wallet.

1391
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:09,944
Hurry up. The scrambled eggs
seller will close shop soon.

1392
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:11,951
'The scrambled eggs
seller didn't close shop.'

1393
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:16,083
'But these guys grew hungrier.'

1394
01:33:17,725 --> 01:33:20,421
Does it has to be told? -'And then?

1395
01:33:20,728 --> 01:33:24,027
No, Brother Naru. I SWear l
haven't taken parsha's money.

1396
01:33:24,198 --> 01:33:25,688
Is his wife lying then?

1397
01:33:26,067 --> 01:33:28,228
She forgot her money in
the train. You stole it.

1398
01:33:28,336 --> 01:33:30,167
T.ell me where the
money is and go home.

1399
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:32,364
Brother Naru, I really
don't havethe money.

1400
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:36,374
You are getting beaten
like a dog for a mere Rs.5000.

1401
01:33:36,477 --> 01:33:40,004
T.ell me. Where's the money?
- You idiot! - pakya! pakya!

1402
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:43,475
I have been observing him
since long. He won't talk.

1403
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:46,018
Give him to me. I'll
make him talk like a parrot.

1404
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:49,146
Nurse your head first.
- It's nothing, Brother Naru.

1405
01:33:49,323 --> 01:33:52,952
The idiot.. I'll kill him!
- T.ake him away.

1406
01:33:53,594 --> 01:33:57,086
Come on. - Leave me.
- sit here and drink beer.

1407
01:33:57,264 --> 01:33:59,232
These guys are beyond reproach.

1408
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:02,300
They have just hit you on the
head now, they will kill you.

1409
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:05,363
Hey, attend to the phone.

1410
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:12,943
T.ell me. Where's the money? -
Hello. Who is it? shalu -Shalu?.Yes.

1411
01:34:13,047 --> 01:34:17,006
Is hethere? - Who?
Naru? - Is Naru there?

1412
01:34:17,118 --> 01:34:20,212
He isn't here. - Where
did he go? - Hewent out.

1413
01:34:20,454 --> 01:34:22,422
Hang up.
- He didn't tell..

1414
01:34:23,991 --> 01:34:27,358
Oh, my God. I just forgot..
- What's the matter with Shalu?

1415
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:31,689
Matter? She had called
meto meet her. I forgot.

1416
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:34,227
Oh, no. It's because of him!

1417
01:34:37,004 --> 01:34:43,068
What do I do? Listen, should I go?
- What about him?

1418
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:44,677
Let him be here. I'll be back soon.

1419
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:47,943
You idiot, why are you
hell-bent on getting beaen?

1420
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:51,280
Should I find out?
- Find out? I'll slap you.

1421
01:34:51,986 --> 01:34:53,954
Listen, I'll be back in an hour.
Look after them.

1422
01:34:54,055 --> 01:34:55,352
Don't let them drink too much.

1423
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:58,083
Bandya, that's enough.
- Okay, brother.

1424
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:01,290
You idiot!
- Listen.

1425
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:06,364
You fool!
- pakya! pakya!

1426
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:19,105
You idiot!
- Go there. Go!

1427
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,046
T.atya, go stand there.

1428
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:25,677
Listen, these aren't boys,
they are animals.

1429
01:35:25,786 --> 01:35:27,048
They'll tear you apart.

1430
01:35:27,254 --> 01:35:28,551
T.ell me. Where's the money?

1431
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:32,025
Listen. Have you lost it?
- Hit him! Hit him.

1432
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:34,287
Don't spare him. Don't
spare him. Hit him. Hit him.

1433
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:05,652
Hey get out. Get out!

1434
01:36:21,509 --> 01:36:23,204
My sister-in-law has 1000 rupees.

1435
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:26,678
Rs.1,000 got spent.
- All right. Go on.

1436
01:36:26,981 --> 01:36:32,009
I spent some of the money.
- More was spent. All right.

1437
01:36:32,219 --> 01:36:37,122
Where's the rest of the money?
- With mywife.

1438
01:36:37,424 --> 01:36:40,154
Oh no. You're making it
difficult to spare you.

1439
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:42,024
Hey.. - Speak up, you!
- No.. no!

1440
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:26,564
pakya..

1441
01:37:41,222 --> 01:37:42,246
How are you sister Manju?

1442
01:37:47,428 --> 01:37:50,158
How come you're late today?

1443
01:37:51,999 --> 01:37:53,398
I wondered ifyou were
going to come at all today.

1444
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:00,405
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1445
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:02,299
Then why are you so quiet?

1446
01:38:05,112 --> 01:38:07,945
I need some money. The thing is..

1447
01:38:08,048 --> 01:38:11,950
..that we haveto pay
father's dispensary bills.

1448
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,382
The medicines are also finished.

1449
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:17,580
The room's rent is due.

1450
01:38:19,994 --> 01:38:21,962
Our old lady came home
yesterday and cried.

1451
01:38:29,003 --> 01:38:32,336
How much do you need?
- At least Rs.5,000.

1452
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:35,966
Oh, God! Where do l
get that much from?

1453
01:38:36,977 --> 01:38:38,410
I probably have Rs.1,000 or so.

1454
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:41,070
That much won't be enough.

1455
01:38:43,717 --> 01:38:45,947
If Naru werethere, it
wouldn't be aworry.

1456
01:38:46,987 --> 01:38:48,011
Where has he gone?

1457
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:51,958
He's been in jail for two months.

1458
01:38:52,526 --> 01:38:54,960
He's been charged with murder.

1459
01:39:01,135 --> 01:39:02,227
What are you going to do now?

1460
01:40:29,223 --> 01:40:34,661
Have something to ea.
- No.

1461
01:40:39,133 --> 01:40:42,967
When my husband comes,
I'll go home with him.

1462
01:40:44,738 --> 01:40:48,435
Rane came awhile back.
- He's here?

1463
01:40:49,243 --> 01:40:50,232
He's sitting inside.

1464
01:41:05,526 --> 01:41:07,494
You're back? You're late.

1465
01:41:08,595 --> 01:41:09,687
We'll leave. We'll
leave in just a moment.

1466
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:14,424
The employers have called us
tomorrow for negotiations?

1467
01:41:15,402 --> 01:41:16,960
I think something
good is going to happen.

1468
01:41:26,513 --> 01:41:30,210
Great. Is it good news?

1469
01:41:33,987 --> 01:41:35,477
We must have a son, all right?

1470
01:41:35,989 --> 01:41:37,957
A daughter means
additional expenses.

1471
01:41:50,003 --> 01:41:51,630
Have you called us
here to make fun of us?

1472
01:41:53,006 --> 01:41:54,633
You'll give theworkers'
pending dues in four weeks.

1473
01:41:54,741 --> 01:41:56,231
You'll only give 7% of the gratuity.

1474
01:41:56,477 --> 01:41:58,411
And we should hand our
resignations to you?

1475
01:41:58,512 --> 01:42:00,946
Even to give this much,
we'll have to take loans.

1476
01:42:01,048 --> 01:42:02,538
Do you think we're fools?

1477
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:05,140
You get new cars everyday.

1478
01:42:06,386 --> 01:42:08,047
You demolish old
bungalows and get new ones built.

1479
01:42:09,223 --> 01:42:10,952
What a mill workers
earns in a lifetime..

1480
01:42:11,058 --> 01:42:13,424
..your four dogs ea
that much worth in a month.

1481
01:42:14,328 --> 01:42:16,956
Rane, there's no
point to this argument.

1482
01:42:17,064 --> 01:42:19,965
I promise you that once
the mill land is sold..

1483
01:42:20,067 --> 01:42:22,558
..I'll paythe
workers' dues immediately.

1484
01:42:22,669 --> 01:42:24,967
Mr. Khaitan, we're
not sure of getting..

1485
01:42:25,072 --> 01:42:26,972
..what is written in this agreement.

1486
01:42:27,074 --> 01:42:28,701
Who is going to believe you?

1487
01:42:29,343 --> 01:42:30,935
You've been stretching
theworkers to the limits..

1488
01:42:31,044 --> 01:42:32,944
..of their patience
for the past six months.

1489
01:42:34,047 --> 01:42:36,607
Workers' wives have
started taking up jobs as maids.

1490
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:39,316
Children have gone astray.
Many have committed suicide.

1491
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,283
And yet, you're making fun ofus?

1492
01:42:42,256 --> 01:42:45,157
We deeply regretwhat
happened to Kashiram.

1493
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:48,962
In fact, I've even
prepared a compensation cheque.

1494
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:51,555
It's in the drawer.
T.ake it now if you wish.

1495
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:52,962
Are weto takethe chequeto build..

1496
01:42:53,066 --> 01:42:54,966
..a shrine in Kashiram's name?
If you had given it on time..

1497
01:42:55,068 --> 01:42:56,968
..it would have at least
saved the lives ofthethree.

1498
01:42:58,305 --> 01:42:59,329
Greedy wretch.

1499
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:03,134
Your father may have
been greedy, you wretch.

1500
01:43:06,246 --> 01:43:07,270
It's quite enough.

1501
01:43:08,081 --> 01:43:11,244
Otherwise, I'll have your
limbs broken and you thrown out.

1502
01:43:11,985 --> 01:43:13,680
Wretched third class beggar.

1503
01:43:18,158 --> 01:43:19,455
Govind! What are you doing?

1504
01:43:21,328 --> 01:43:24,627
Rogue! You call us beggars?
Who made us that?

1505
01:43:25,299 --> 01:43:28,268
Rane, no negotiations now.
please get out.

1506
01:43:29,469 --> 01:43:33,565
Govind! - You'll haveto come
groveling one day, Mr. Khaitan.

1507
01:43:34,007 --> 01:43:35,031
I say, get out!

1508
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,311
Govind! Comethis way.

1509
01:44:18,485 --> 01:44:20,953
It's not enough.
- Five is not enough?

1510
01:44:21,722 --> 01:44:22,950
We'll haveto finish someone off.

1511
01:44:23,056 --> 01:44:24,956
He's just aworthless mill worker.

1512
01:44:25,259 --> 01:44:26,521
Still, we have to finish him off.

1513
01:44:28,528 --> 01:44:31,053
Whatthen?
- Seven.

1514
01:44:37,004 --> 01:44:43,136
Five and a half. Six, last.

1515
01:44:49,983 --> 01:44:52,679
What is that?
- Advance. It's three.

1516
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:58,455
T.ake it. Hey, Varvantya..
- Yes, boss?

1517
01:44:59,226 --> 01:45:03,629
Call up the lawyer. We
haveto get Naru bailed. - Ok.

1518
01:45:05,599 --> 01:45:08,363
Varvantya, don't have beer.
Fiirst, put up thetable.

1519
01:45:08,669 --> 01:45:11,263
Okay.
- 100 from me. - 100 from me.

1520
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:14,364
100 from me.

1521
01:45:15,075 --> 01:45:16,099
Boss parshya, Naru.

1522
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:19,946
Come, Naru. Come. Sit. Have a sea.

1523
01:45:20,047 --> 01:45:21,071
What's going on, Boss parshya?

1524
01:45:21,181 --> 01:45:22,341
You told me you'd
have me out in 15 days..

1525
01:45:22,449 --> 01:45:23,677
..and left meto rot
in jail fortwo months.

1526
01:45:23,984 --> 01:45:25,417
I was having trouble.
- T.rouble!

1527
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:27,953
Would I do it deliberately?

1528
01:45:28,121 --> 01:45:29,247
I had some problems, dear.

1529
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:30,482
Whattrouble, Boss parshya?

1530
01:45:30,724 --> 01:45:32,453
They tortured metwice, you know.

1531
01:45:34,261 --> 01:45:39,096
200. You're all right now,
aren't you? - Yes. I'm okay now.

1532
01:45:39,599 --> 01:45:41,066
We've gotten a
fantastic contract for a hit.

1533
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:43,963
You'll get at least Rs.200,000.

1534
01:45:44,071 --> 01:45:49,008
What? Rs.200,000?
- Yes. It's a hit for a kill.

1535
01:45:50,277 --> 01:45:53,940
A kill? So thetarget
must be a big-shot, right?

1536
01:45:54,047 --> 01:45:58,484
No. It's some mill worker. 200..
- A mill worker? Who?

1537
01:45:58,652 --> 01:46:00,244
That's whatwe couldn't figure out.

1538
01:46:01,488 --> 01:46:03,251
Rs.200,000 for a mill worker?

1539
01:46:03,523 --> 01:46:05,354
It seems theworth of
mill workers has increased.

1540
01:46:05,459 --> 01:46:07,620
Brother Naru!

1541
01:46:09,996 --> 01:46:11,964
Hey pakya, play.

1542
01:46:12,065 --> 01:46:17,162
Brother Naru.. - What is it?
- Uncle's men talk nonsense.

1543
01:46:17,604 --> 01:46:22,166
They say you'll be killing
a mill worker. - It's true.

1544
01:46:22,409 --> 01:46:27,039
What are you saying? A mill worker?

1545
01:46:27,447 --> 01:46:29,608
They're dead anyway.
He'll get free of this life.

1546
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:31,409
We'll be getting afine Rs.200,000.

1547
01:46:31,518 --> 01:46:32,951
We'll take your parents,
my parents..

1548
01:46:33,053 --> 01:46:34,953
..go to the Konkan and settle
down there. What do you say?

1549
01:46:35,422 --> 01:46:39,984
I don't think its okay.
- I don't either.

1550
01:46:40,093 --> 01:46:41,617
We just haveto takethe money.

1551
01:46:42,596 --> 01:46:44,587
Money? What money?

1552
01:46:44,998 --> 01:46:48,092
I won't give
permission in the first place.

1553
01:46:48,301 --> 01:46:52,965
What did you say? What won't
you give? - permission. Yes.

1554
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:56,371
You'll give me
permission now, will you?

1555
01:46:56,476 --> 01:47:00,936
Just because I coddled you as a
friend, you'll tryto rule me?

1556
01:47:03,984 --> 01:47:05,952
It's going to rain.
Movethe carom inside.

1557
01:47:06,219 --> 01:47:07,243
Come on, let's go ea.

1558
01:47:07,354 --> 01:47:08,480
I was telling him sincethen.

1559
01:47:17,998 --> 01:47:22,560
T.ea. Go on.
- You, Sir?

1560
01:47:22,669 --> 01:47:25,035
Do you wanttea? -
Why are you shouting?

1561
01:47:25,539 --> 01:47:29,407
Chandu, what happened?
- We're just having tea.

1562
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:33,375
Don'tworry. Something
good will happen, you'll see.

1563
01:47:33,647 --> 01:47:36,946
How?
- The case is in court today.

1564
01:47:37,417 --> 01:47:39,612
Rane said the verdictwill
surely come in our favour.

1565
01:47:39,986 --> 01:47:42,955
Where's Rane?
- Hewas in court all day.

1566
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:45,252
I finally told him to go home.

1567
01:47:46,259 --> 01:47:48,318
I just wish this whole
mess would be over now.

1568
01:47:48,995 --> 01:47:51,555
The children are getting
out ofhand. - You're right.

1569
01:47:52,999 --> 01:47:55,559
I'm also going to get Speed
breaker a job in the mill.

1570
01:47:55,669 --> 01:47:56,693
In theweaving line.

1571
01:47:57,003 --> 01:47:59,972
His mother said he's
begun to drink these days.

1572
01:48:00,073 --> 01:48:01,165
How are the children wrong, Sir?

1573
01:48:02,008 --> 01:48:03,942
The day before yesterday,
I got drunk..

1574
01:48:04,044 --> 01:48:05,944
..and slapped my wife.
My son punched me.

1575
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:11,478
Speed breaker told me.
Do you have a 'beedi'?

1576
01:49:08,408 --> 01:49:11,536
Govind Rane got shot!

1577
01:49:11,645 --> 01:49:13,272
Hey, run. Call the police.

1578
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,938
Someone killed Govind Rane!

1579
01:49:15,048 --> 01:49:16,072
Call the ambulance.

1580
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:18,278
Call Mr. Rane.

1581
01:49:18,585 --> 01:49:20,052
Somebody shot Govind!

1582
01:49:38,204 --> 01:49:39,228
Don't cry.

1583
01:49:41,241 --> 01:49:42,265
Stop it, Naru.

1584
01:49:43,276 --> 01:49:44,300
Look.. forget what happened.

1585
01:49:46,513 --> 01:49:47,537
Don't worry.

1586
01:49:49,049 --> 01:49:55,215
Govind! Boss parshya, you
should have told me earlier.

1587
01:49:55,322 --> 01:49:56,550
You crazy boy, I didn't know either!

1588
01:49:57,390 --> 01:49:58,618
That Mahendra didn't tell me before.

1589
01:49:58,725 --> 01:50:02,957
Darn Mr. Mahendra! That was
my Speed breaker's father!

1590
01:50:03,063 --> 01:50:10,970
Naru! Naru!
- Speed breaker..

1591
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:15,632
Darn you! You wretch!
You killed my father!

1592
01:50:15,742 --> 01:50:20,406
Hey, let go off him! -
He killed my father.

1593
01:50:22,282 --> 01:50:23,943
I won't spare you!
You killed my father!

1594
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:26,143
Let go off him! - T.ake him away.

1595
01:50:26,252 --> 01:50:33,624
Hey, he's gone nuts. T.ake him away.
- You idiot, I won't spare you!

1596
01:50:33,727 --> 01:50:35,217
I really didn't know!
I SWear on my mother!

1597
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:38,357
T.ake him away. - Hit him!

1598
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,297
I really didn't know!
I SWear on my mother!

1599
01:50:41,401 --> 01:50:42,493
They lied to me.

1600
01:50:43,737 --> 01:50:45,602
I really didn't know! I
didn't know it was your father!

1601
01:50:45,705 --> 01:50:47,104
From now on, we're enemies!

1602
01:50:47,207 --> 01:50:48,231
I'll not spare you!

1603
01:50:51,711 --> 01:50:53,941
Hello? - Boss parshya,
police were informed..

1604
01:50:54,047 --> 01:50:56,277
..that Naru committed the murder.

1605
01:50:56,383 --> 01:50:59,944
What?
- Yes. Inspector Shinde told me.

1606
01:51:00,453 --> 01:51:01,943
All right.
- What is to be done now?

1607
01:51:02,055 --> 01:51:08,119
Hang up now! A new mess.

1608
01:51:08,228 --> 01:51:09,252
What happened, boss?

1609
01:51:09,996 --> 01:51:11,486
police found out
that Naru was the one..

1610
01:51:11,598 --> 01:51:12,690
..who committed the murder.

1611
01:51:13,099 --> 01:51:16,193
How come? - Mr. Mahendra
must have informed them.

1612
01:51:16,436 --> 01:51:17,960
Darn it? - Brother Naru,
what will you do now?

1613
01:51:18,071 --> 01:51:20,699
Boss parshya, what about me now?

1614
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:25,038
Don't worry. I'll handle everything.

1615
01:51:26,646 --> 01:51:28,944
Do one thing. Go into
hiding for 10-12 days.

1616
01:51:30,583 --> 01:51:31,607
Boss parshya, that..

1617
01:51:32,252 --> 01:51:36,951
In 2-4 days, I'll send
Rs.200,000 to your house.

1618
01:51:38,291 --> 01:51:40,122
Come on now, run.

1619
01:51:40,226 --> 01:51:42,091
Come one, let's get

1620
01:51:42,996 --> 01:51:44,623
Brother Naru, what do we do now?

1621
01:51:44,731 --> 01:51:45,959
Don't pause here. Come on,
let's go. Fast. Come on.

1622
01:51:46,066 --> 01:51:47,090
Let's get out of here.

1623
01:51:49,536 --> 01:51:50,696
What do we do now, boss?

1624
01:51:52,005 --> 01:51:53,029
What the heck can we do?

1625
01:51:56,376 --> 01:51:58,207
All right, come on. Move forward,
quickly. - Yes, Sir?

1626
01:51:58,511 --> 01:52:01,344
Go on.. this is your
first installment, okay?

1627
01:52:01,581 --> 01:52:03,947
Come forward. Hurry up.

1628
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:06,618
Come on, tell me your name.

1629
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:07,948
Hey, give him the money.

Dilip Waghate.
- Hey, what are you doing?

1634
01:52:21,601 --> 01:52:22,625
You'retaking the money?

1635
01:52:23,002 --> 01:52:26,961
The management is
fooling us. Listen to me.

1636
01:52:27,073 --> 01:52:30,304
Hey, get lost. - Don'ttake money,
they are fooling us.

1637
01:52:31,344 --> 01:52:33,938
Bhosle, you're also
standing to take the money?

1638
01:52:34,247 --> 01:52:35,942
Listen to me, don't takethis money.

1639
01:52:36,049 --> 01:52:38,415
Rane, leave now or I'll slap you.

1640
01:52:38,718 --> 01:52:40,948
What can I say now?
You'll slap me? Listen to me.

1641
01:52:41,321 --> 01:52:43,255
Ganya, you're also standing in
line hereto takethe money?

1642
01:52:43,356 --> 01:52:45,153
Ganya, this is a ploy ofthe owners.

1643
01:52:45,992 --> 01:52:49,155
The verdict will come in soon.
Have a little patience.

1644
01:52:49,329 --> 01:52:51,957
Listen to me. - Just leave,
Rane. It's you union leaders..

1645
01:52:52,065 --> 01:52:53,589
..who have ruined us.

1646
01:52:54,234 --> 01:52:55,462
What can I say now? Leaders?

1647
01:52:56,002 --> 01:52:57,367
You were in the management with me?

1648
01:52:57,470 --> 01:52:58,562
Weren't you with me in the union?

1649
01:52:58,671 --> 01:53:01,970
Rane, don't make me lose my temper.

1650
01:53:02,075 --> 01:53:03,565
Ifyou have any sense,
go get in line.

1651
01:53:03,643 --> 01:53:05,338
Listen to me, Ganya.
Don't takethe money.

1652
01:53:05,578 --> 01:53:08,570
Rane, I told you not to make
me lose my temper! Get lost!

1653
01:53:08,681 --> 01:53:10,376
Mohan, make your
brother-in-law understand.

1654
01:53:10,483 --> 01:53:13,111
Listen!
- Let him be. He's broken.

1655
01:53:13,987 --> 01:53:15,011
What is it? Move forward.

1656
01:53:15,121 --> 01:53:16,145
Hey, listen to me.

1657
01:53:21,995 --> 01:53:23,485
Anna, you did awrong thing.

1658
01:53:24,130 --> 01:53:26,189
Don't get angry, Rane. Calm down.

1659
01:53:26,432 --> 01:53:27,626
How do I calm down?

1660
01:53:29,002 --> 01:53:32,233
Let everyone else be.
Even you took money?

1661
01:53:32,405 --> 01:53:34,066
You stabbed your
son-in-law in the back?

1662
01:53:34,174 --> 01:53:37,109
Rane, your strike
was bound to get stuck.

1663
01:53:37,210 --> 01:53:39,678
What do you mean by that?
- The Soviet Union has collapsed.

1664
01:53:39,979 --> 01:53:41,674
You leftists haven't
yet realised that?

1665
01:53:42,982 --> 01:53:45,143
You can't fight against capitalism.

1666
01:53:46,052 --> 01:53:47,485
It's timeto put Marxist
principles to rest. Understand?

1667
01:53:47,587 --> 01:53:49,953
Who knows Marxist
principles around here?

1668
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:52,249
And theywill win, rememberthat.

1669
01:53:52,992 --> 01:53:54,960
You've all gone crazy
at the sight of money.

1670
01:53:55,061 --> 01:53:56,085
And the owners are
taking advantage..

1671
01:53:56,196 --> 01:53:57,220
..ofthat very helplessness.

1672
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:58,490
Brother-in-law, why are
you yelling your head off?

1673
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:00,488
I'm yelling?

1674
01:54:01,334 --> 01:54:03,268
My efforts ofnine
months were laid waste!

1675
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:06,038
You couldn't be a little patient?

1676
01:54:06,139 --> 01:54:08,107
How much more
patient should anyone be?

1677
01:54:09,008 --> 01:54:10,032
people committed suicide.

1678
01:54:10,276 --> 01:54:12,005
They got into despicable acts.

1679
01:54:12,579 --> 01:54:13,944
What else? We should
just take bowls in hand..

1680
01:54:14,047 --> 01:54:15,071
..and go out begging.

1681
01:54:15,515 --> 01:54:18,678
Hewon't even let me beg.
He'll starve meto death.

1682
01:54:19,052 --> 01:54:21,612
You traitor! You
wretched woman, you.. - please..

1683
01:54:21,721 --> 01:54:25,350
Let go off her! - Brother-in-law,
that's quite enough ofyour acts now!

1684
01:54:25,658 --> 01:54:26,955
Otherwise, I'll punch you right now.

1685
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:30,395
I? I'm putting up an act? I?

1686
01:54:30,997 --> 01:54:32,692
I'm exhausted doing
other people's work.

1687
01:54:33,633 --> 01:54:37,160
No one thinks me worth anything.
I'm acting?

1688
01:54:38,171 --> 01:54:39,806
He says I'm acting!
You'reworthless, Rane!

1689
01:54:39,806 --> 01:54:41,296
He says I'm acting!
You'reworthless, Rane!

1690
01:54:42,008 --> 01:54:43,407
You're utterly worthless!

1691
01:54:44,577 --> 01:54:46,169
You aren't worth anything at all!

1692
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:50,211
Everything is over now.
Everything is over now.

1693
01:54:50,316 --> 01:54:53,217
Everything is over now.
Everything is over now.

1694
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:57,352
Shameless! - Everything is over now.

1695
01:54:58,324 --> 01:55:00,053
Dear.. sit down.

1696
01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:03,253
Manju, no one values me.

1697
01:55:08,001 --> 01:55:09,025
Enough, Mohan!

1698
01:55:18,344 --> 01:55:19,368
Dhuri?

1699
01:55:19,979 --> 01:55:25,246
Dhuri? Dhuri?
Baba, just have a look.

1700
01:55:26,119 --> 01:55:28,246
Dhuri?
- Father! Dhuri.. Dhuri? - Father?

1701
01:55:28,588 --> 01:55:29,612
Has something happened?
- Father!

1702
01:55:29,722 --> 01:55:34,318
Father.. - Dear, please
say something! Get up.

1703
01:55:35,261 --> 01:55:37,195
Oh Anna. - Hey,
what happened to you?

1704
01:55:37,297 --> 01:55:38,321
Baba, I'll go get a doctor!

1705
01:55:38,431 --> 01:55:41,594
Mohan, go get a doctor.
- Mohan, it's no use.

1706
01:55:41,701 --> 01:55:45,967
T.ell mewhat happened to you?
- Father! Father!

1707
01:56:24,110 --> 01:56:27,944
Don't cry.
Everything will be all right.

1708
01:56:28,047 --> 01:56:31,107
What will be all right, pakya?
My father died!

1709
01:56:31,217 --> 01:56:32,946
I couldn't even go
for his cremation.

1710
01:56:33,987 --> 01:56:36,956
I'm sitting here
terrified like a coward..

1711
01:56:37,056 --> 01:56:40,958
T.oothy! Hey, toothy!
- What is it?

1712
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:45,292
Look at that. - That way.
- Come on. - Oh, God!

1713
01:56:45,398 --> 01:56:47,958
Go tell Naru.
- I'm going.

1714
01:56:48,067 --> 01:56:51,628
Brother Naru..

1715
01:56:51,738 --> 01:56:53,569
Your mother, Mohan and
Manju are coming here.

1716
01:57:18,998 --> 01:57:24,129
Hit me. Hit me! Why are
you looking at me like that?

1717
01:57:25,138 --> 01:57:26,162
I'm worthless.

1718
01:57:27,173 --> 01:57:28,970
I didn't even come for
my father's cremation.

1719
01:57:30,176 --> 01:57:31,473
In greed for a lousy Rs.200,000..

1720
01:57:31,577 --> 01:57:33,602
..I killed Speed
breaker's father. Our Govind.

1721
01:57:35,348 --> 01:57:38,943
You.. Here, takethis.
Shoot me, Mother! Shoot me.

1722
01:57:40,987 --> 01:57:43,956
Shoot you? I won't let you
get out ofthis so quickly.

1723
01:57:45,725 --> 01:57:47,955
Suffer the fruits ofyour own deeds.

1724
01:57:49,395 --> 01:57:51,090
Go walking to hell, you wretch!

1725
01:57:53,499 --> 01:57:55,967
I know I'm going to.
I made a mistake.

1726
01:57:57,003 --> 01:57:58,971
I SWear on you,
I'll be surrendering..

1727
01:57:59,072 --> 01:58:00,096
..to the police
myself in a few days.

1728
01:58:02,408 --> 01:58:04,103
Father's last rites are on Friday.

1729
01:58:05,111 --> 01:58:06,135
Yes. I'll come.

1730
01:58:06,245 --> 01:58:08,611
But don't perform it
on Chowpatty beach.

1731
01:58:08,714 --> 01:58:09,942
policewill be keeping watch there.

1732
01:58:10,383 --> 01:58:12,943
A day earlier, go to Vasu's aunt.

1733
01:58:14,287 --> 01:58:18,053
I'll get there in the morning.
- Come.

1734
01:58:23,596 --> 01:58:28,556
It's 'bhakri (coarseflatbread)
and fritters. Have it. - T.ake it!

1735
01:58:31,537 --> 01:58:32,970
And spend the Rs.200,000..

1736
01:58:33,072 --> 01:58:35,336
..that Boss parshya
sent you with care.

1737
01:58:38,578 --> 01:58:39,670
What Rs.200,000?

1738
01:58:52,225 --> 01:58:55,058
Hello?
- Yes, Mr. Mahendra. Hello.

1739
01:58:55,228 --> 01:58:57,958
Yes, tell me, parshya.
How come you've called?

1740
01:58:58,498 --> 01:59:00,489
It's been eight days since
Govind was finished off.

1741
01:59:00,733 --> 01:59:01,961
Rs.300,000 have still not arrived.

1742
01:59:03,002 --> 01:59:04,629
Was he even worth that much?

1743
01:59:05,304 --> 01:59:06,965
He wasn't even worth
the advance I gave you.

1744
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:10,402
Yes, but we had decided on
Rs.600,000, Mr. Mahendra.

1745
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:12,940
If I pay Rs.600,000
for a useless fellow..

1746
01:59:13,045 --> 01:59:15,946
..what will become of
my prestige? Or yours?

1747
01:59:16,983 --> 01:59:18,382
Will you give Rs.300,000 or not?

1748
01:59:18,985 --> 01:59:21,476
We'll see. Look, these days,
there's a bit of a situation on.

1749
01:59:21,988 --> 01:59:23,956
And don't call me repeaedly.
I don't like it.

1750
01:59:24,056 --> 01:59:25,956
Do you think this is trivial,
Mr. Mahendra?

1751
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:30,020
Darn Mr. Mahendra!
- What happened, boss?

1752
01:59:30,129 --> 01:59:33,098
He's gone back on his word.
He says hewon't pay.

1753
01:59:33,332 --> 01:59:34,560
Let's just kill him.

1754
01:59:35,001 --> 01:59:36,025
Killing him won't
be of any useto us.

1755
01:59:36,736 --> 01:59:37,964
What do we do then?

1756
02:00:54,981 --> 02:00:56,005
It's Rs.300,000.

1757
02:00:58,517 --> 02:01:01,418
If you had given it earlier,
the old man wouldn't have died.

1758
02:01:03,322 --> 02:01:06,689
It's because the old man died
that you got the money fast.

1759
02:01:06,993 --> 02:01:09,120
What? - My father-in-law
was a very good person.

1760
02:01:10,229 --> 02:01:11,457
But he didn't have any foresight.

1761
02:01:12,732 --> 02:01:13,960
He was stuck in the mill's..

1762
02:01:14,066 --> 02:01:16,557
..and mill workers'
problems all his life.

1763
02:01:20,473 --> 02:01:21,963
Itwas causing a loss ofmillions.

1764
02:01:23,976 --> 02:01:27,412
Mr. Mahendra, you're a
more dangerous man than us.

1765
02:01:28,447 --> 02:01:29,471
practical.

1766
02:01:30,983 --> 02:01:33,952
If you stick with mewithout
getting into minor idiocies..

1767
02:01:34,053 --> 02:01:35,077
..you'll go far.

1768
02:01:35,988 --> 02:01:40,948
Yes, boss. Come on, Varvantya.

1769
02:01:44,997 --> 02:01:47,557
He's such an idiot.

1770
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,365
Mr. Mahendra is not a good man.

1771
02:01:49,602 --> 02:01:51,069
He killed his own father-in-law.

1772
02:01:52,004 --> 02:01:53,972
It does well to have such people..
neither as friends nor as enemies.

1773
02:01:54,073 --> 02:01:55,097
Boss, now that
we've got Rs.300,000..

1774
02:01:55,207 --> 02:01:57,937
..Iet's go to Chanchal..
- Do you have nothing elseto do?

1775
02:01:58,044 --> 02:01:59,204
We had gone to see her
dance yesterday, right?

1776
02:01:59,478 --> 02:02:00,945
Why do you want to go everyday?

1777
02:02:02,581 --> 02:02:04,549
Boss, may I go for a moment?

1778
02:02:05,718 --> 02:02:07,083
Stop drinking so much beer.

1779
02:02:07,586 --> 02:02:09,577
You're getting older.
Come back fast.

1780
02:02:10,723 --> 02:02:12,054
His liver is going to
stop working one day.

1781
02:02:24,070 --> 02:02:25,094
Hello, Boss parshya.

1782
02:02:26,005 --> 02:02:28,200
I'll pump you full of bullets.
Get your hand out ofthere.

1783
02:02:32,411 --> 02:02:38,043
Naru, you'll point a gun
at me now? At boss parshya?

1784
02:02:38,984 --> 02:02:40,576
You're my friend.

1785
02:02:42,254 --> 02:02:43,278
Is thatwhy you
disgraced that friendship?

1786
02:02:44,990 --> 02:02:46,014
What are you saying, Naru?

1787
02:02:46,592 --> 02:02:47,957
Would I disgrace friendship?

1788
02:02:48,994 --> 02:02:52,395
Look, I've arranged to get
you out of Govind's murder.

1789
02:02:52,631 --> 02:02:55,964
Really?
- I swear on my mother.

1790
02:02:56,068 --> 02:02:57,501
You were going to
send Rs.200,000 home.

1791
02:02:57,603 --> 02:03:00,197
After you left, I went to
your housetwice, you know.

1792
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:02,971
But the policewere
watching so closely..

1793
02:03:03,075 --> 02:03:04,940
..that I thought it would
needlessly causetrouble.

1794
02:03:05,711 --> 02:03:07,941
Is it written on my
face that I'm a fool?

1795
02:03:09,048 --> 02:03:11,312
Naru, if you don't
believe me, what do l..

1796
02:03:15,521 --> 02:03:18,149
Naru, takethis. It's Rs.300,000.

1797
02:03:18,724 --> 02:03:19,952
Rs.100,000 for the
sake of friendship.

1798
02:03:20,059 --> 02:03:24,621
Count it. T.ake it. Come on,
take it. It's yours.

1799
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:26,561
T.ake it. T.ake it.

1800
02:03:30,302 --> 02:03:32,463
Very good.

1801
02:03:33,672 --> 02:03:38,939
You wretch, you
point a gun at me? At me?

1802
02:03:40,980 --> 02:03:43,540
Give methe bag. Give it here.

1803
02:03:46,986 --> 02:03:49,352
What are you looking at?
pull the trigger.

1804
02:04:09,975 --> 02:04:14,935
Naru, don't kill me. I am sorry.
please, forgive me.

1805
02:04:16,715 --> 02:04:19,309
I'll give you Rs.1 million.

1806
02:04:20,719 --> 02:04:21,947
These Rs.300,000.

1807
02:04:22,988 --> 02:04:25,548
I'll get you the
Rs.700,000 right away.

1808
02:04:26,225 --> 02:04:27,954
I'll just go home and get it, Naru.

1809
02:04:35,601 --> 02:04:39,298
Fifteen. Fifteen.

1810
02:04:41,006 --> 02:04:45,670
You won't see me around. I'll leave.

1811
02:04:47,646 --> 02:04:51,605
One chance. Don't kill me, Naru.

1812
02:05:05,998 --> 02:05:08,489
Hit him. Hit him.

1813
02:05:08,601 --> 02:05:10,501
Come on, let's get out
ofhere. - Hit him harder.

1814
02:05:17,443 --> 02:05:21,937
pakya, here. T.ake this money.
I'll be leaving now.

1815
02:05:24,984 --> 02:05:27,009
I wondered if Naru was
leaving without giving us money.

1816
02:05:27,119 --> 02:05:30,316
What ifhewas? - I'd have
killed him too right here.

1817
02:05:30,656 --> 02:05:32,624
"What if hewas", indeed! Come on.

1818
02:05:32,725 --> 02:05:33,953
Whereto, this way?

1819
02:05:34,994 --> 02:05:36,962
We havethis now, right? So come on.

1820
02:05:37,329 --> 02:05:40,093
"As we go.."

1821
02:06:17,002 --> 02:06:19,095
put water on this now.

1822
02:06:19,738 --> 02:06:21,501
Arethere only two sons, or
are any others still to arrive?

1823
02:06:21,607 --> 02:06:22,631
Our younger
brother is still to come.

1824
02:06:23,008 --> 02:06:24,407
If hewas going to come,
he alreadywould have.

1825
02:06:24,977 --> 02:06:26,945
please start the rites.

1826
02:06:54,406 --> 02:06:57,273
Mother! Mother..

1827
02:06:58,978 --> 02:07:04,382
Forgive me, mother. The police are
after me. That's why I got late.

1828
02:07:04,483 --> 02:07:06,610
Come, pay your respects quickly.

1829
02:07:13,325 --> 02:07:14,349
Sorry.

1830
02:07:17,663 --> 02:07:18,687
Come on.

1831
02:07:26,605 --> 02:07:30,939
Mr. T.ana Duri. Here all your
family members got together..

1832
02:07:31,043 --> 02:07:33,534
..and completed this veneration.

1833
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:50,185
Now, say 'kaav' to the crows.

1834
02:09:35,501 --> 02:09:40,063
Why? Why? We were friends, right?

1835
02:09:40,572 --> 02:09:43,700
Why? Why? T.ell me, you wretch.

1836
02:09:43,976 --> 02:09:47,207
Why did you kill my father?

1837
02:09:48,447 --> 02:09:51,007
I swear on my mother, I didn't know.

1838
02:09:52,651 --> 02:09:54,949
Speed.. sorry..

1839
02:10:05,597 --> 02:10:11,433
Hey, Brother Naru..
get up. Brother Naru..

1840
02:10:11,737 --> 02:10:14,968
Naru.. Brother Naru!

1841
02:10:16,975 --> 02:10:21,071
Hit me. Hit me.

1842
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:25,245
I'm your right hand man, am I not?

1843
02:10:25,384 --> 02:10:30,481
Usman punched me here.

1844
02:10:30,589 --> 02:10:34,457
You go punch Usman. Come on,
Brother Naru! Get up!

1845
02:10:34,993 --> 02:10:37,553
Get up, Brother Naru!

1846
02:10:38,130 --> 02:10:42,965
Forgive me, brother Naru.

1847
02:10:44,603 --> 02:10:48,039
I don't have anyone. Not even
father. Now even you are leaving me.

1848
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:49,937
You are mine. please, get up.

1849
02:10:50,075 --> 02:10:52,100
Get up. T.ell him to.

1850
02:10:52,711 --> 02:10:54,611
T.ell him to get up.

1851
02:10:55,214 --> 02:11:00,083
Get up. Forgive me, my brother.

1852
02:11:00,986 --> 02:11:05,582
Hey mother, tell him to get up.

1853
02:11:07,292 --> 02:11:08,953
Mother, I am sorry.

1854
02:11:09,061 --> 02:11:11,962
The police never found
out who killed Naru.

1855
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:15,624
Because my mother
didn't tell anyone.

1856
02:11:17,202 --> 02:11:18,567
My mother was a strangewoman.

1857
02:11:21,139 --> 02:11:24,939
Tiime went by. Everyone
settled into their own lives.

1858
02:11:26,578 --> 02:11:29,945
That day, forthe first time,
I saw pride for me..

1859
02:11:30,048 --> 02:11:31,948
..in my mother's eyes.
- Where is it?

1860
02:11:32,050 --> 02:11:33,950
Why are you looking here and there?

1861
02:11:34,186 --> 02:11:35,278
Look, it's written here.

1862
02:11:36,088 --> 02:11:39,057
The play's name is
'Barfaallela Jwalamukhi'.

1863
02:11:39,591 --> 02:11:43,118
Writer, Anant Dhuri. producer..

1864
02:11:43,228 --> 02:11:45,958
Let that be. Let the producer be..

1865
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:51,197
You did it, Son. You did
what you said you would.

1866
02:11:53,005 --> 02:11:57,465
See, Dhuri? Our children's
names are in the newspaper.

1867
02:12:00,979 --> 02:12:03,948
Naru, you didn't
produce your brother's play..

1868
02:12:04,049 --> 02:12:05,539
..but someone did.

1869
02:12:06,318 --> 02:12:09,048
Such a big advertisement
has come in the newspaper.

1870
02:12:09,221 --> 02:12:11,621
Mother, set the
newspaper aside and comewith me.

1871
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:14,049
Where?
- I haveto get you a new sari.

1872
02:12:15,227 --> 02:12:17,127
You are going to see my
first program with metomorrow.

1873
02:12:17,229 --> 02:12:20,630
No.. no. I feel shy.

1874
02:12:20,732 --> 02:12:22,222
What do I understand of your play?

1875
02:12:22,334 --> 02:12:23,562
It's fine if you
don't understand, Mother.

1876
02:12:23,669 --> 02:12:24,693
You'll still have to come.

1877
02:12:25,470 --> 02:12:26,960
If you don't come, not
even the play's rehearsals..

1878
02:12:27,072 --> 02:12:28,130
..will take place.
- Fool.

1879
02:12:29,975 --> 02:12:32,375
Come on quickly, Mother. I
haveto go the rehearsal too.

1880
02:12:32,978 --> 02:12:35,208
Aunt, when Mohan comes,
make him some tea.

1881
02:12:35,314 --> 02:12:36,542
Don't worry. I'll give it to him.

1882
02:12:37,516 --> 02:12:39,950
Come on, Mother. Come on.

1883
02:12:41,453 --> 02:12:45,947
Mother! Mother!

1884
02:12:48,527 --> 02:12:54,625
Aunt, get water! Quickly! Mother!

1885
02:12:55,667 --> 02:12:57,191
Mother!

1886
02:13:00,339 --> 02:13:02,330
Mother never came for the play.

1887
02:13:03,008 --> 02:13:03,997
Shewas just looking
at the newspaper..

1888
02:13:04,109 --> 02:13:05,133
..when she passed away.

1889
02:13:10,983 --> 02:13:16,944
Baba.. - Shetoiled hard all
her life. She suffered a lot.

1890
02:13:19,391 --> 02:13:23,953
But she died with a
smile on her face.

1891
02:13:29,601 --> 02:13:32,399
Oh, God! How did you all live?

1892
02:13:36,608 --> 02:13:38,473
We lived in such a protected shell.

1893
02:13:39,644 --> 02:13:46,208
But what people theywere.
Alive. Full oflife.

1894
02:13:46,985 --> 02:13:53,549
No, Mansi. They always lived
under the threat of death.

1895
02:13:55,594 --> 02:13:58,961
They always lived under
the shadow of the rich.

1896
02:14:05,737 --> 02:14:11,334
Come. - Anant, where
do Mohan and Manju stay?

1897
02:14:12,611 --> 02:14:14,943
Do you want to meet them? - Yes.

1898
02:14:15,981 --> 02:14:20,941
Manju stays in a tenement room.
- And Rane?

1899
02:14:21,053 --> 02:14:22,077
No, Rane is still alive.

1900
02:14:22,988 --> 02:14:25,548
Everything happened in
pursuit ofthat case.

1901
02:14:27,325 --> 02:14:28,349
Enough. Stop here.

1902
02:14:28,994 --> 02:14:33,954
This is our tenement.
Lakshmi Cottage.

1903
02:14:37,636 --> 02:14:39,968
Get up now. I'm serving the meal.

1904
02:14:41,406 --> 02:14:43,931
I have an appointment at
2:30pm atthe parlour.

1905
02:14:45,043 --> 02:14:47,944
You'll yell later
that the food was cold.

1906
02:14:50,515 --> 02:14:53,177
Sometimes, I think this
man is quite deaf. Get up.

1907
02:14:53,285 --> 02:14:56,277
Hey..
- Come..

1908
02:14:57,989 --> 02:15:00,958
Baba! You're here
after such a long while!

1909
02:15:01,093 --> 02:15:04,426
I was busy. Manju,
this is Mansi. My..

1910
02:15:04,529 --> 02:15:07,054
I understand. Don't
start telling me in detail.

1911
02:15:07,165 --> 02:15:10,293
I have no time at all.
Come on in, Mansi.

1912
02:15:10,402 --> 02:15:12,563
Darn this tap! Hardly
anywater is coming today.

1913
02:15:12,671 --> 02:15:14,366
And I had to scrub last
night's dirty vessels too.

1914
02:15:15,006 --> 02:15:16,303
Then, in the morning,
therewas the hurry..

1915
02:15:16,408 --> 02:15:17,602
..to prepare lunch.
It's just exhausting.

1916
02:15:17,976 --> 02:15:20,069
And my husband
doesn't even try to help.

1917
02:15:25,083 --> 02:15:28,314
Will you havetea, Mansi?
- No.

1918
02:15:28,587 --> 02:15:30,953
No? Thank God. I haveto
leave for the parlour.

1919
02:15:31,123 --> 02:15:36,026
We'll meet up later and talk, okay?
- okay

1920
02:15:36,128 --> 02:15:39,325
Baba, how are you? - Fiine,
how are you? - Good.

1921
02:15:39,998 --> 02:15:41,022
How come you're here
all of a sudden today?

1922
02:15:41,333 --> 02:15:44,496
He has cometo meet me, not you.
Gulp it down now. - Now..

1923
02:15:47,139 --> 02:15:49,403
You forgot the salt again, Manju.

1924
02:15:50,075 --> 02:15:51,940
Get up and get it yourself.
Acts like Baji Rao.

1925
02:15:52,277 --> 02:15:55,041
please give it, Manju.
- What?

1926
02:15:55,447 --> 02:15:58,075
Every afternoon, I leavework
to serve him his meal at home.

1927
02:15:58,583 --> 02:16:00,949
Can't he get it himself?
Have his hands broken?

1928
02:16:01,987 --> 02:16:03,113
Union leader.

1929
02:16:03,421 --> 02:16:06,185
Your sister has no brains.
- Yes.

1930
02:16:06,525 --> 02:16:08,959
The high court is going to
give its verdict in a month.

1931
02:16:09,594 --> 02:16:11,585
All the workers are going to repent.

1932
02:16:12,998 --> 02:16:17,196
No one has
understood myworthy, you see.

1933
02:16:17,536 --> 02:16:18,560
If they had understood..

1934
02:16:18,670 --> 02:16:20,035
..I wouldn't havethis
millstone around my neck.

1935
02:16:20,138 --> 02:16:23,938
What? What did you say?
- Nothing, my prince.

1936
02:16:24,042 --> 02:16:27,944
Eat in peace. I'll be off, Baba.
Bye, Mansi. - Okay.

1937
02:16:28,046 --> 02:16:29,479
Baba, Mansi is nice.

1938
02:16:29,981 --> 02:16:32,040
What did you see in Baba?

1939
02:16:32,517 --> 02:16:33,950
Rinse out the plate, dear.

1940
02:16:34,619 --> 02:16:37,486
Wiill you have lunch, Baba?
- No, you eat.

1941
02:16:38,223 --> 02:16:39,952
I'm getting late. I'll leave now.

1942
02:16:40,625 --> 02:16:46,621
Come later, after the verdict.
We'll have a drink then.

1943
02:16:46,731 --> 02:16:48,096
All right. Come, Mansi.

1944
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:51,967
One moment.
- You finish yours.

1945
02:16:54,673 --> 02:16:55,970
Hey, give metea.

1946
02:16:56,141 --> 02:16:57,938
Mother, give me chocolate.

1947
02:16:58,043 --> 02:16:59,067
How many chocolates will you eat?

1948
02:16:59,177 --> 02:17:03,011
Uncle, tell mother. She
doesn't let me have chocolates.

1949
02:17:03,648 --> 02:17:05,582
Why do you ask her?
I'll buy it for you.

1950
02:17:06,284 --> 02:17:08,582
Don't, Mohan. It spoils the teeth.

1951
02:17:09,054 --> 02:17:11,215
He's my nephew.
Nothing will happen to him.

1952
02:17:11,456 --> 02:17:13,014
Come, let's go get it.
- Let's go.

1953
02:17:13,992 --> 02:17:17,689
put on a shirtfirst.
- No. It's hot.

1954
02:17:17,996 --> 02:17:19,258
Shall I give you a kick? Come on.

1955
02:17:19,431 --> 02:17:22,025
You have a bad
habit of roaming naked.

1956
02:17:22,133 --> 02:17:23,293
Mother, give me clothes.

1957
02:17:23,401 --> 02:17:24,561
T.ell Mohan to give you clothes.

1958
02:17:24,669 --> 02:17:25,693
Mr. Mohan.

1959
02:17:26,605 --> 02:17:29,369
Who is it? Baba!
- Baba!

1960
02:17:32,510 --> 02:17:34,535
When did you get here?
- A while back.

1961
02:17:35,213 --> 02:17:36,237
I was visiting Manju.

1962
02:17:36,982 --> 02:17:39,007
Your hair has gone so grey.
I'll go get something.

1963
02:17:39,317 --> 02:17:40,944
No, it's a bit late.

1964
02:17:42,587 --> 02:17:47,024
Who is she?
- This is Mansi.

1965
02:17:47,225 --> 02:17:48,419
Hello.
- You got married?

1966
02:17:49,995 --> 02:17:53,954
No I mean.
- Live in? Right?

1967
02:17:55,066 --> 02:17:57,261
What?
- You won't understand.

1968
02:17:58,270 --> 02:17:59,362
I don't see uncle around.

1969
02:17:59,471 --> 02:18:01,962
Hewas here. There he is.

1970
02:18:03,742 --> 02:18:06,302
Well, uncle? How are you?
- Who?

1971
02:18:07,579 --> 02:18:10,946
Oh, God! The writer himself.
Come on inside.

1972
02:18:11,049 --> 02:18:13,244
Hey open a beer.
- No, nottoday. Some other time.

1973
02:18:13,585 --> 02:18:16,281
Have you met my son?

1974
02:18:16,988 --> 02:18:21,118
Yes. I had come last time.
He has been named Naru.

1975
02:18:22,093 --> 02:18:23,424
Naru. I miss him.

1976
02:18:24,129 --> 02:18:27,963
Forget it. But doesn't
he look just like me?

1977
02:18:28,133 --> 02:18:31,432
He looks like me doesn't he?
Sameto same. Carbon copy.

1978
02:18:34,239 --> 02:18:37,970
Again, uncle?
- Better late than never.

1979
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:43,948
I'll be offnow.

1980
02:18:48,620 --> 02:18:51,612
Shall we go, uncle?
- put on a shirt first.

1981
02:18:51,723 --> 02:18:53,953
Mother, give me a shirt.
- Come.

1982
02:18:59,998 --> 02:19:01,625
Uncle, give me a cigarette.

1983
02:19:02,334 --> 02:19:06,065
I have just one. Let's share.

1984
02:19:14,379 --> 02:19:16,939
What an amazing placethis is.

1985
02:19:19,451 --> 02:19:21,476
I think it's a
tomb of living people.

1986
02:19:23,988 --> 02:19:29,221
After a while, buildings
will come up here. Skyscrapers.

1987
02:19:31,596 --> 02:19:32,688
Why are you laughing? T.ell me.

1988
02:19:34,065 --> 02:19:35,965
Now, we say dinosaurs used o exist.

1989
02:19:37,502 --> 02:19:41,097
After a few years, people will
say mill workers used to exist.

1990
02:19:44,209 --> 02:19:47,610
Shall we leave? I feel frightened.
- Come.

1991
02:19:48,213 --> 02:19:49,942
Do you want to see Jignesh?
- Oh, yes.

1992
02:19:52,150 --> 02:19:53,174
There he is.

1993
02:20:07,999 --> 02:20:10,627
Come on.
- Anant, where all the children?

1994
02:20:11,736 --> 02:20:14,364
Vaatanya and Daatadyawere
killed in police encounters.

1995
02:20:18,977 --> 02:20:20,444
