1
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:05,905
Smoking and drinking alcohol 
is injurious to health.

2
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:44,219
Mumbai

3
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:52,922
(Phone rings)

4
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:57,280
Hello! We caught the wrong man. 
Let him go.

5
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,469
Really? 
- Yes. I found out just now.

6
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:01,725
Did you inquire correctly?

7
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:04,244
We checked his whole background. 
It is not him.

8
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:05,519
Let him go. 
- Okay.

9
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,616
What?

10
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:08,654
It is not him, Boss.

11
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:12,016
He.. It is not him?

12
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:13,346
They checked everything.

13
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:14,849
What do we do now, Boss?

14
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:18,556
(Gunshot)

15
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:19,940
(Brakes squeal)

16
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:44,364
Boss, our thrashing 
has left him almost dead.

17
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:45,423
What should we do?

18
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:52,236
Darn!

19
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,182
He escaped!

20
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:59,039
(Snaps finger) I have to find him no 
matter where he is on this earth!

21
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:03,796
I won't spare him! I won't!

22
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,892
(Gunshot)

23
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:20,641
Throw him in the sea.

24
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:27,578
(Groans)

25
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,302
Vishakapatnam

26
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,486
Why should we hide in 
the library to escape class?

27
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:25,583
I can't bear this silence.

28
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:28,135
This silence is better 
than that violence.

29
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:35,827
(Phone rings)

30
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:36,982
Who is that?

31
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:38,135
How many times should 
I tell you to keep..

32
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:39,659
..the phones on silent mode.

33
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:42,308
Buddy! Our library is like 
Sai Baba's Temple on Thursday..

34
00:04:42,686 --> 00:04:43,973
..it is filled with beautiful girls.

35
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:46,080
You want some entertainment now, right?

36
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,161
Hmm, yes.

37
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:48,696
Okay, I will give you a live show. 
Watch it.

38
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:51,074
Yes, come. Come straight.

39
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:53,096
Did you hear everything?

40
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:53,993
(Slaps)

41
00:04:55,074 --> 00:04:56,901
Have you lost it? What are you talking?

42
00:04:57,138 --> 00:04:58,857
Telugu. 
- What is it, dear? What's the matter?

43
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,468
Even though you are here..

44
00:05:00,548 --> 00:05:01,863
..he is shamelessly 
saying vulgar things to me.

45
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:03,246
What? What did you say?

46
00:05:03,326 --> 00:05:05,419
Nothing, madam. 
I just said 'Come straight.'

47
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:08,017
No, madam. He said 'You're hot. 
Come home tonight'..

48
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:09,487
..but now he is changing his words.

49
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:13,304
Even if you stand on a bench 
you'll still be shorter than her.

50
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:16,147
How dare you! Boys like 
you should be severely punished.

51
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:18,182
Yes, madam. We should courageously..

52
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:19,890
..file a 'Nirbhaya' case on such men.

53
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,809
We should publicly 
hang them near the port.

54
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:24,377
Buddy, they are going to hang you.

55
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,193
Slap yourself and say sorry.

56
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,362
Sorry? Why should I? 
I don't say sorry even to my father.

57
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:30,135
If you don't say sorry to her..

58
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:32,211
..this movement that started 
in the college library..

59
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:35,335
..will become a tempest 
and spread to the whole country..

60
00:05:36,124 --> 00:05:37,216
..until you say sorry.

61
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,580
Buddy, you'll be in trouble. Say sorry.

62
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,234
Sorry, sister. Forgive me.

63
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:43,986
I'll never cross your path again.

64
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:45,478
I'll deal with you later.

65
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:48,115
Don't worry, dear. Be brave.

66
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:49,099
Thank you, madam.

67
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:57,655
It was good entertainment, wasn't it?

68
00:05:57,735 --> 00:05:59,136
Yes. 
- I'm so happy.

69
00:05:59,216 --> 00:05:59,981
Excuse me.

70
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,078
What is the rate?

71
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:02,878
11.

72
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:06,503
What? 10,000 for one night?

73
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,789
What?

74
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:10,211
Miss, you've misunderstood me.

75
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,919
Hey! What are you saying?

76
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,984
How dare you ask me what my rate is?

77
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:18,541
If you discuss your 
rate like this in public..

78
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:20,260
..and if everyone hears you..

79
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,703
..I can never get 
married in the future..

80
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,870
..my life will be ruined, 
I'll never find a wife.

81
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,864
Have you gone mad?

82
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:28,864
What is going on here?

83
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:33,275
Sir! She said 'You are cute. 
Will you join me tonight?

84
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:34,637
..My rate is 10,000 rupees.'

85
00:06:34,717 --> 00:06:37,063
What? 10,000 for a night?

86
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:38,890
Yes. 
- Sir, listen to me. He asked..

87
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,962
Quiet.

88
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:43,508
I will settle this matter. 
What did he ask you?

89
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:44,668
He asked 'What is the rate?'

90
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:45,609
What did she say?

91
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:46,819
She said '10,000 rupees.'

92
00:06:46,992 --> 00:06:48,138
Sir, I said 11.

93
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:50,268
Did you hear that, sir? 
She increased her rate already.

94
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:53,230
Oh no! I think this is about call money.

95
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:54,560
I've to be careful.

96
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,137
Look, dear! 
I know that you are the HOD's daughter..

97
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,115
..but you can't disgrace 
his name like this.

98
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:01,867
What you are doing is very wrong.

99
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,630
Don't repeat such mistakes. Go home.

100
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,511
This is called tit for tat.

101
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:08,457
The subject is closed. 
Everyone go to class.

102
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,636
Everyone leave. Get out.

103
00:07:15,214 --> 00:07:17,160
Three main reasons of this theory..

104
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,090
..in this semester..

105
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,117
Excuse me.

106
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,841
Listen! We won't tolerate it anymore.

107
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:23,733
You've to settle this matter today. 
- That's it.

108
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:25,292
I don't understand what you are saying.

109
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:26,838
Enough!

110
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:28,827
Enough is enough!

111
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,937
Suspend Vikrant and throw him out! 
- Yes.

112
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:35,571
Will you tell me the problem 
or continue to waste time?

113
00:07:35,651 --> 00:07:37,147
He is our college topper.

114
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:41,720
Sir! I understood that 
you all are angry with me.

115
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:45,771
We have a class now. 
We'll talk about it later, sir, please.

116
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:49,825
Whoa! Don't act innocent in front of us! 
We know you!

117
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:52,225
We have to settle this 
right here right now!

118
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,852
Okay. Are you sure about it?

119
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:59,024
Our decision is final. 
No one can change it.

120
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,175
Okay. Bablu is ready 
to give you a live telecast..

121
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:05,932
..of the details of this case.

122
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:07,846
Bablu! Bablu, can you hear me?

123
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:09,179
Yes, Vikrant. I can hear you. Go ahead.

124
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,796
So, what information do 
you have about our lecturer..

125
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:13,558
..Romantic Ramanadham?

126
00:08:13,638 --> 00:08:15,925
Vikrant, we have a 
video in our possession..

127
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:17,071
..that shows Ramanadham 
sir's charm and wit.

128
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:18,931
We can see it now. Over to studio.

129
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:23,909
Hi! 
- Hi!

130
00:08:24,374 --> 00:08:27,520
Sir! Don't you think Shailaja 
has put on a little weight?

131
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:30,149
Why wouldn't she? She has no work to do.

132
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:34,549
Since her husband gets tired 
after working all day in office..

133
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:37,025
..I don't think he gets 
intimate with her at night.

134
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,760
You are very naughty.

135
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:40,868
(Laughs)

136
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,576
I have the Physics 
lecture for B.Com students.

137
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:47,247
I'm leaving. 
- Stop it!

138
00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:50,057
What is your age? 
And what are you doing?

139
00:08:50,254 --> 00:08:51,994
Do you think nobody will stop you?

140
00:08:52,254 --> 00:08:53,151
One minute, sir.

141
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:53,929
I don't have time.

142
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:57,292
Bablu! Can you hear 
Vijay Kumar sir's anguish?

143
00:08:57,562 --> 00:08:58,913
I can hear it, Vikrant. 
- Carry on.

144
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:02,878
Where was our sir last 
night between 10 pm to 12 am?

145
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:05,678
Last night our Vijay Kumar 
sir went to Rang Mahal theater..

146
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:07,343
..to watch an amazing movie called..

147
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:09,343
..'Beauty From The Alley 
And A Bed Of Jasmines'..

148
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,317
..which has been successfully 
running for four weeks.

149
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:15,830
It is time for my special class. 
See you later.

150
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:18,371
And talking about you..

151
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:20,230
Sir! 
- Huh?

152
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:22,255
You have extra-ordinary 
skills in multi-tasking.

153
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:24,882
Four girls at the same time.

154
00:09:25,218 --> 00:09:28,072
Hema, Rekha, Jaya and Sushma.

155
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:33,187
24/7 chatting, 
flirting, photo-sharing and so on.

156
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,317
Are you wondering how we know that?

157
00:09:35,793 --> 00:09:37,274
Meet your chatting friends.

158
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:40,809
Hema, Rekha, Jaya and Sushma.

159
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,647
You'll never progress in life, 
useless bloody idiots.

160
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:46,095
Haven't you seen enough 
scandals for today?

161
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:47,241
Why are you still standing here? 
Let's go.

162
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,371
They will ruin us if we stay here. 
Let's go.

163
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:50,787
Superb. 
- (Laughs)

164
00:09:51,136 --> 00:10:18,234
(Music)

165
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:22,071
"Go, let's go.. Like a rocket"

166
00:10:22,151 --> 00:10:25,836
"Go, let's go.. Like a missile"

167
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,739
"Go, let's go.. Like a crashing wave"

168
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:33,509
"Go, let's go.. Like a massive mountain"

169
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:38,536
"Run like soldiers in warfare"

170
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:49,005
"Fly like an eagle 
tearing the skies apart"

171
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:57,603
"You are a hero"

172
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:01,852
"Unleash.. 
Unleash the great courage in your heart"

173
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:06,141
"Play.. Play until you win.."

174
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:23,336
"There's a question and an answer.."

175
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,925
"..and there is research in between."

176
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:26,850
"There's defeat and victory.."

177
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,579
"..and there's training in between."

178
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:30,715
"There's languor and vigor.."

179
00:11:30,795 --> 00:11:32,358
"..and there's 
determination in between."

180
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:35,699
"Did you notice this thing?"

181
00:11:36,282 --> 00:11:43,974
"Every man that is 
born has to die one day"

182
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:47,628
"And there's life in between"

183
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:51,747
"There should be a meaning to that life"

184
00:11:52,890 --> 00:12:00,555
"You are a hero"

185
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:04,738
"Unleash.. 
Unleash the great courage in your heart"

186
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:09,052
"Play.. Play until you win"

187
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:33,943
(Music)

188
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:39,156
"Can we be naughty 
at 60 like we were at 20?"

189
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:42,745
"Can we waste our life 
trying to be a good boy?

190
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:46,604
"Can we miss the fun 
for the world around?"

191
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:50,485
"Can we get back our 
youth once we lose it?"

192
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:54,377
"Even if you are naughty.."

193
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:58,254
"..you'll see that you'll gain victory"

194
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:01,912
"The world will stand in a queue.."

195
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:05,955
"..to click a selfie with you"

196
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,198
Oh no! We are dead.

197
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:21,144
Daddy!

198
00:13:22,788 --> 00:13:27,988
"You are a hero"

199
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:34,567
"Unleash.. 
Unleash the great courage in your heart"

200
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,859
"Play.. Play until you win"

201
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:41,507
(Laughs)

202
00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:43,118
(Gasps)

203
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,955
(Phone rings)

204
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:47,057
Who is it?

205
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:49,252
Let's go.

206
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:51,550
(Phone rings)

207
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,111
What should I tell mom?

208
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:57,149
What should I tell her? 
What should I tell her? - (Phone rings)

209
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:58,613
Hello? Where are you?

210
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,451
Mom, I'm.. 
Bablu got tickets and forced me to..

211
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:05,067
..come to a movie with him.

212
00:14:05,316 --> 00:14:08,040
Movie? Why can't I hear any sounds then?

213
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,171
Is it a silent movie?

214
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:11,927
No, Mom. It started just now.

215
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:13,419
What happened to this city?

216
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:16,025
It is filled with 
stifling smoke and grime.

217
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,544
Why doesn't anyone speak up?

218
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,387
We should put an end 
to this reckless behavior.

219
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,160
Smoking is banned in public places.

220
00:14:22,387 --> 00:14:24,377
Banned in public places. 
It is okay to smoke here.

221
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,485
That ad proves that 
you are in the theater.

222
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,404
Actually, Bablu is a useless fellow.

223
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:32,299
I'm afraid that he'll 
be a bad influence on you.

224
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:34,104
Come home as soon as the movie finishes.

225
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:35,488
Bye, Mom. 
- Bye, Mom.

226
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:38,688
All parents in this world 
feel that their son is a saint and..

227
00:14:38,768 --> 00:14:40,267
..all his friends are useless.

228
00:14:58,173 --> 00:14:59,262
(Claps)

229
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:02,036
There is no end to my son's experiments.

230
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:04,782
He has turned this 
house into a magical den.

231
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:07,117
Wake up, son.

232
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:09,376
Did you forget that you 
have a boxing match today?

233
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:11,690
Daddy! Please!

234
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:14,916
I don't like boxing or karate. 
Leave me alone.

235
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:16,477
(Siren wails)

236
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:17,721
Oh no! Mom is coming.

237
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:21,267
Portrait changed.

238
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,191
She'll kill me if 
she sees the cigarette.

239
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:36,260
Mom! Good morning, Mom!

240
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,957
My darling son! 
- (Chuckles)

241
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,563
Why are you disturbing 
him early in the morning?

242
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:42,945
I am disturbing him? 
Is that what you think?

243
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:43,723
(Laughs)

244
00:15:43,803 --> 00:15:44,772
Both mother and son are the same.

245
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,410
Son is smart, 
his mother is smarter than him.

246
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:50,491
Here, take them.

247
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:52,264
Oh no! 
- Come on, let's go.

248
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:53,994
Bye. 
- Bye.

249
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:32,477
What's up? You said you'll 
bring a player for practice..

250
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:34,303
..but instead you came 
back with a wrestler.

251
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:38,443
To become a wrestler, 
he has to compete with a wrestler.

252
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:40,649
(Laughs)

253
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,951
Poor thing. 
Looks like the boy is scared.

254
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:47,755
You don't know him. He's like a rocket.

255
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:51,290
Once he starts, 
he'll stop only when he wants..

256
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:53,686
..nobody else can stop him.

257
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:56,529
Really? You are no wrestler 
and he is no champion.

258
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,216
Even if you both come at me together..

259
00:16:58,296 --> 00:16:59,697
..you can't harm a 
single hair on my head.

260
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,221
Hey! 
- Huh?

261
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:03,859
He doesn't need to fight. 
I'm enough to take you down.

262
00:17:04,117 --> 00:17:05,436
Come on, then.

263
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:25,962
Yeah!

264
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:27,919
Come on!

265
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,231
Hmm.

266
00:18:30,886 --> 00:18:33,534
(Grunts)

267
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:34,464
Darn!

268
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:49,652
(Laughs)

269
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:55,460
(Groans)

270
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,114
How long can you endure it?

271
00:18:57,514 --> 00:18:59,546
Take my advice and sign the papers.

272
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:01,612
I'd rather die than sign those papers.

273
00:19:01,692 --> 00:19:04,456
I know how to make him sign the papers.

274
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,250
I'll get the documents 
signed and sent to Mumbai.

275
00:19:09,785 --> 00:19:10,726
Give me the knife.

276
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:16,225
(Screams)

277
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,029
I'll sign. 
I'll sign. Paper.. Pen.. Paper..

278
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:22,737
Sign here.

279
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:27,278
Subhani! I'm an MLA. I'm in politics.

280
00:19:27,358 --> 00:19:29,127
You turned me into a goon again.

281
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:30,951
Thank you.

282
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:32,173
Murthy! 
- Yes, sir?

283
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:33,418
Remove the knife from sir's leg..

284
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:35,440
..and get him treated in Care Hospital. 
- Okay, sir.

285
00:19:35,626 --> 00:19:36,759
Give me the documents.

286
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:40,902
Bablu! 
- Yes, Auntie?

287
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:41,799
Do you want an 'Arisa'?

288
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:42,772
I'll eat it without complaining.

289
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,096
Oh dear! 
Why are you eating those 'Dosas'?

290
00:19:47,176 --> 00:19:47,658
Hmm.

291
00:19:47,738 --> 00:19:48,631
They are leftovers from last night.

292
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:50,253
I was going to feed them to the dog.

293
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:52,458
(Coughs and splutter)

294
00:19:54,177 --> 00:19:55,215
You could've told me before.

295
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:56,928
You think only you can play pranks?

296
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,626
Wow! Well played!

297
00:19:58,706 --> 00:20:00,042
(Laughs)

298
00:20:00,122 --> 00:20:01,382
Uncle, I need to ask you one thing.

299
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:03,263
You already asked.

300
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:04,950
I need to ask you two things.

301
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:06,348
You already asked.

302
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:08,099
Oh, is that how you'll play it?

303
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:10,207
Okay, I have to ask you four things.

304
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:11,807
You already asked.

305
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:13,321
When? 
- Just now.

306
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,699
Every family has one weird person.

307
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:19,567
But everyone in this family is weird. 
- Okay. Bye, Mom!

308
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:21,053
Hey, wait a minute.

309
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:22,945
I cooked Malabar Spinach Lentil Soup..

310
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:24,772
..Bitter Gourd Fry 
and Bottle Gourd Curry.

311
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:26,926
Itchy Leaves Fry, Aloe Vera Curry..

312
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,731
..Crown Flower Chutney 
and Soap Nuts Gravy.

313
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:29,650
You should've made those too.

314
00:20:30,115 --> 00:20:31,596
Tell me when you are free.

315
00:20:31,676 --> 00:20:33,566
I'll make them especially for you. 
- Make them for Uncle.

316
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:35,696
Ignore him. Finish your box. 
Don't share it with him.

317
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,036
Oh no! Eat the whole thing. Let's go.

318
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:38,604
We are getting late for class.

319
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:40,638
The temple is right beside your house. 
It's a blessing.

320
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:44,595
I wonder where he is. Find him.

321
00:20:48,357 --> 00:20:49,233
Here he comes.

322
00:20:53,572 --> 00:20:57,248
Your mom works so hard 
to cook strange recipes for you.

323
00:20:57,328 --> 00:20:58,599
And this crazy man 
is always waiting for you.

324
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,323
Poor mom. She cooks these 
dishes so lovingly for me.

325
00:21:02,403 --> 00:21:05,037
I don't want to hurt her, 
and I don't want to throw this food..

326
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,453
..so I give it to him.

327
00:21:06,982 --> 00:21:08,723
Mom is happy because 
she thinks I ate the food.

328
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:11,351
This man is happy because 
he is getting food.

329
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:12,940
All in all, I'm happy.

330
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,670
You didn't ask me to eat that food. 
I'm happy.

331
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:18,465
Nice beggar.

332
00:21:18,984 --> 00:21:19,957
All the best.

333
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,726
Lunch box for him and bags for me. 
Well done.

334
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:26,586
I'll hold it.

335
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,764
Didn't you go the class yet?

336
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:30,316
Are you new to the college 
or have you lost your mind?

337
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:31,963
Don't you know that this 
is Dinesh's parking place?

338
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:32,947
Put up a board. 
- (Slaps)

339
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:34,536
What did you say? Shut up and get lost!

340
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:37,034
They are threatening 
people using Dinesh's name.

341
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:39,563
Go park the bike there. 
Let's see what they do.

342
00:21:39,643 --> 00:21:41,715
No, buddy. 
We are already in Dinesh's bad books.

343
00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:43,708
And his brother is competing 
to become a minister.

344
00:21:43,788 --> 00:21:44,757
Do we really need this now?

345
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:47,092
They are controlling students 
because students fear them.

346
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,038
Remove it. Remove it. Now go.

347
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:54,969
(Brakes squeal)

348
00:21:59,923 --> 00:22:02,572
(Tires squealing)

349
00:22:31,505 --> 00:22:32,402
Hi, Uncle!

350
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:36,348
Hi, Anagha! How are you? How is Delhi?

351
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:38,024
It asked me to go to Andhra immediately, 
so I came.

352
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:41,293
Okay. Will your father 
ever step on this earth..

353
00:22:41,373 --> 00:22:43,250
..or will he retire while 
going around in flights?

354
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,461
(Laughs)

355
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,201
You are his childhood friend.

356
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:48,536
You know him better than me.

357
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:51,115
I came here to stay with my grandma..

358
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:53,418
..until mom and dad 
return from Australia.

359
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:54,164
(Laughs)

360
00:22:54,391 --> 00:22:57,472
That's good. Anyway, 
I have completed all the formalities.

361
00:22:57,552 --> 00:22:59,764
Here you go, 
your final year admission papers.

362
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:00,575
Okay.

363
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:04,044
I've an important meeting. 
I've to make a move.

364
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,233
Take a tour of the college 
and come to the canteen.

365
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:09,428
Shilpa is in class, 
I'll tell her to meet you.

366
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:10,379
Okay.

367
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,573
"This is my first love letter"

368
00:23:17,653 --> 00:23:21,573
"I wrote it because 
I couldn't talk to you"

369
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:25,621
"I couldn't stand before 
you and express my feelings"

370
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:29,751
"I didn't know enough 
words to express them"

371
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:33,659
"I didn't know enough 
words to express them"

372
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:35,097
I love you so much, Divya.

373
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,935
I cannot live without you.

374
00:23:38,762 --> 00:23:40,308
You don't have to give me a reply now.

375
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:42,005
You can think it through 
and give me a reply tomorrow.

376
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:44,019
I'll be waiting in the park for you.

377
00:23:49,165 --> 00:23:54,974
(Laughs)

378
00:23:55,504 --> 00:23:56,682
Why are you laughing?

379
00:23:56,762 --> 00:23:57,558
Nothing.

380
00:23:57,638 --> 00:23:58,401
You can tell me.

381
00:23:58,481 --> 00:23:59,612
Are you going to the park tomorrow?

382
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:02,044
How can I not accept him 
after this thrilling proposal?

383
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:03,417
Give me that card.

384
00:24:07,943 --> 00:24:10,310
The card is worth 70 rupees.

385
00:24:10,613 --> 00:24:14,105
The cost of that rose will be 20 rupees.

386
00:24:14,962 --> 00:24:17,351
That cold drink is 15 rupees.

387
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,622
And the song that he sang..

388
00:24:19,702 --> 00:24:22,778
..he didn't put in any effort 
to write a special song for you.

389
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,927
So, he spent just 105 
rupees to win you over.

390
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:30,981
What else can a man do to propose?

391
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:33,144
Does he have to spend 
thousands and millions?

392
00:24:33,224 --> 00:24:34,960
I'm not talking about money.

393
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,720
A guy's proposal should 
be shockingly amazing.

394
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,828
Your heart should just 
stop beating for a moment.

395
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:42,920
You should feel that 
you are born only for him.

396
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:44,542
Do you have a boyfriend?

397
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:45,482
No.

398
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:46,640
You'll never have one.

399
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,559
I had a strange dream last night.

400
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,954
What?

401
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,300
I'm walking to the 
Himalayas for something.

402
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:53,938
For what?

403
00:24:54,018 --> 00:24:56,902
I'm crawling and jumping. 
I'm surrounded by valleys.

404
00:24:57,421 --> 00:24:59,378
Bone-biting cold. 
But nothing is deterring me.

405
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:00,308
Oh.

406
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:02,437
Then I threw a rope from 
this mountain to that mountain.

407
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:05,346
While I'm crawling, 
crawling, slowly crawling..

408
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,708
..it suddenly broke..

409
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:07,635
What broke?

410
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,386
The rope. 
- Oh, the rope.

411
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:14,662
I went rolling down the 
valley and fell into a river.

412
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:17,851
I heard some voices.

413
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:20,491
I felt as if someone touched me.

414
00:25:20,923 --> 00:25:24,048
I found a ring in the water.

415
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:25,648
I put it on my finger.

416
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,212
What happened next?

417
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:29,942
My dream came to an 
end and I was at home.

418
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:33,455
What are you scared about? 
It's just a dream.

419
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:37,088
That's what I thought at first. 
But when I opened my eyes..

420
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,431
..that ring was really on my finger.

421
00:25:40,426 --> 00:25:41,518
Oh my dog!

422
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:46,631
Moreover, 
ever since I put it on my finger..

423
00:25:47,194 --> 00:25:51,063
..I can see everyone's past, 
present and future.

424
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,479
Wow! I can't believe this.

425
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,722
The ring from his dream 
is really on his finger.

426
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,182
This is amazing, 
surprising and thrilling.

427
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,706
Order this ring right now.

428
00:25:56,786 --> 00:25:58,382
Only 2,299 rupees. 
- Hey!

429
00:25:58,987 --> 00:26:00,126
I'm telling you the truth.

430
00:26:00,206 --> 00:26:02,310
Truth? Really? 
Alright, say something about me.

431
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:04,861
I've known you since 
you were in knickers.

432
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:05,975
There's nothing new to tell.

433
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:07,423
Okay, you need someone new. Right?

434
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,713
Look, a beautiful girl that 
can be on Filmfare cover page.

435
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:12,784
Tell me about her.

436
00:26:13,378 --> 00:26:14,924
Hello! I saw the movie..

437
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:18,384
..'Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka 
Sundari' at least 30 times.

438
00:26:18,464 --> 00:26:19,536
Hello! We are ardent 
fans of the 'Boss' too.

439
00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:20,693
We've seen that movie 105 times.

440
00:26:20,773 --> 00:26:24,704
Okay. Since you claim this is a movie, 
I'll prove it to you.

441
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:30,114
Your name has three syllables.

442
00:26:30,698 --> 00:26:32,687
The first syllable starts with A.

443
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,087
You are the only 
daughter to your parents.

444
00:26:35,336 --> 00:26:37,973
You like puppies. You have one too.

445
00:26:38,255 --> 00:26:40,450
Your favorite number is 7.

446
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:42,212
Your favorite hero is Chiranjeevi.

447
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:43,553
And color black.

448
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:45,769
You've recently moved here.

449
00:26:46,158 --> 00:26:48,764
You've total three 
birthmarks on your body.

450
00:26:48,963 --> 00:26:51,017
One is on your waist on the left side.

451
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,185
The second one is..

452
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:53,493
Stop it!

453
00:26:54,877 --> 00:26:56,347
Hey, Anagha! What's wrong?

454
00:26:57,233 --> 00:27:00,784
Shilpa! He is not a human. 
He's a monster.

455
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:02,546
He's telling each 
and everything about me.

456
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,838
So he played a prank on you too.

457
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,205
What do you mean?

458
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:10,675
He is Vikranth. 
Our college's genius and my best friend.

459
00:27:11,204 --> 00:27:13,215
And he has played pranks 
on almost everyone.

460
00:27:13,637 --> 00:27:14,750
What did you do?

461
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:18,458
Actually, madam's entry 
was like an action sequence.

462
00:27:18,696 --> 00:27:22,627
So I planned this to make 
my intro equally exciting.

463
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,627
As soon as I came, 
I came to know your full name..

464
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:25,935
..using your car number plate.

465
00:27:26,015 --> 00:27:27,881
And your name gave me your Facebook ID.

466
00:27:28,076 --> 00:27:31,146
All these details were 
posted by you on Facebook.

467
00:27:32,747 --> 00:27:34,607
God! You scared the hell out of me.

468
00:27:34,844 --> 00:27:36,434
I've never seen anybody like you.

469
00:27:41,374 --> 00:27:42,639
Daddy told me that you were here.

470
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,440
So I came here directly. 
- That's her!

471
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:46,732
I'm so happy to see you. What's new?

472
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,262
I heard you showed something to my boys.

473
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:54,939
Show it to me too.

474
00:27:55,685 --> 00:27:56,561
Sit down!

475
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:00,842
Who are you? 
Do you know who you are messing with?

476
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,261
Is she your girlfriend?

477
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:10,688
She's a new student.

478
00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:12,125
She doesn't know how things work here. 
Leave her alone.

479
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,342
Mind your business, you son of a..

480
00:28:19,412 --> 00:28:20,872
(Groans)

481
00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:34,228
This is between you and me. 
Don't drag my parents into it.

482
00:28:35,606 --> 00:28:36,665
You!

483
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:51,495
Oh no!

484
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,223
(Bottle smashed)

485
00:29:14,488 --> 00:29:15,915
Stop it!

486
00:29:22,746 --> 00:29:25,146
Is this a college 
or a local liquor shop?

487
00:29:25,226 --> 00:29:27,340
Sir! He started the fight.

488
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,687
No, sir. He was the one who misbehaved..

489
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,758
Shut up! Be silent, you both!

490
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,552
You were here when 
the fight started, right?

491
00:29:31,632 --> 00:29:32,255
Hmm.

492
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,504
Whose fault is it? Who started it?

493
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:37,001
Come on, answer me.

494
00:29:43,837 --> 00:29:44,680
Hey!

495
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:47,243
Sir..

496
00:29:47,323 --> 00:29:49,124
I suspend you from college for a week.

497
00:29:49,466 --> 00:29:50,299
But..

498
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:51,218
Get out!

499
00:29:55,142 --> 00:29:56,115
Hey..

500
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,638
Have you gone crazy? 
You said he's your best friend.

501
00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:02,871
You said he's a good guy.

502
00:30:03,282 --> 00:30:05,811
Why did you turn him into 
a scapegoat for a scoundrel?

503
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:06,882
Why don't you speak?

504
00:30:10,985 --> 00:30:11,839
(Crying)

505
00:30:12,088 --> 00:30:13,969
What's wrong? What happened?

506
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:15,753
I had no choice.

507
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,402
Dinesh is not a human, he's a monster.

508
00:30:19,802 --> 00:30:20,959
One day in a party..

509
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:48,629
(Crying)

510
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:50,413
He's blackmailing me that 
if I don't do as he says..

511
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,845
..he'll turn that video into 
a CD and sell it in the market.

512
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:00,294
Not just me, 
many other girls are his victims too.

513
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:02,966
Why can't you inform uncle 
and file a police complaint?

514
00:31:03,046 --> 00:31:05,452
His brother is a local MLA. 
A heartless goon.

515
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:09,474
From constables to politicians 
everyone is scared of him.

516
00:31:10,404 --> 00:31:14,055
Don't worry. I'll talk to uncle. Okay?

517
00:31:17,828 --> 00:31:19,428
What are you thinking about, Uncle?

518
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:22,982
I don't have the courage for that, dear.

519
00:31:24,647 --> 00:31:26,399
If people find out about this..

520
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:29,069
..they will say that Principal's 
daughter has no principles.

521
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:33,877
Dinesh is a scalawag and 
his brother is a cruel monster.

522
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,920
I can't even beg someone 
to help me in this matter.

523
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:42,623
A small problem.. 
Just a small problem can end lives.

524
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:46,813
But every problem has a solution, sir.

525
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:51,657
She wanted to escape from that problem.

526
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:54,697
But he removed that problem forever.

527
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:05,612
How dare you refuse 
to give tickets to my men?

528
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,979
You are the new manager.

529
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,023
But I'm Jagadamba Jaani. 
I'm the local man.

530
00:32:10,103 --> 00:32:11,471
We sold all the tickets online. 
I have no tickets.

531
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:12,401
Quiet!

532
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:15,383
Only I can do Power Star's 
functions around here.

533
00:32:15,577 --> 00:32:17,577
If you don't give us tickets, 
you'll lose your wickets.

534
00:32:17,657 --> 00:32:19,393
Go get the tickets. Go now.

535
00:32:19,577 --> 00:32:22,420
Long live Jaani! Long live Jaani!

536
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,154
Long live Jaani! Long live Jaani!

537
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:29,446
Long live Jaani! Long live Jaani!

538
00:32:29,526 --> 00:32:37,004
(Drums playing)

539
00:32:37,177 --> 00:32:40,841
(Phone rings)

540
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:41,890
Hello?

541
00:32:42,452 --> 00:32:44,312
Really? Where?

542
00:32:44,939 --> 00:32:45,674
I'm coming right now.

543
00:32:45,754 --> 00:32:46,981
Buddy, please don't go. Please..

544
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:50,127
Let me go. 
I have to settle this matter today.

545
00:32:50,365 --> 00:32:53,241
Listen to me. 
They are not good people. Forget it.

546
00:32:53,436 --> 00:32:54,527
Forget it?

547
00:32:55,003 --> 00:32:59,186
How can you say that? 
Who is he? He's my God.

548
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,732
What's wrong, brother? Who are you?

549
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,997
I'll tell you. We are eagerly 
waiting here to celebrate..

550
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:05,813
..our hero's movie and enjoy it.

551
00:33:05,893 --> 00:33:09,107
But a few people are making 
pirated copies of the movie.

552
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,053
I'm going to kill those 
rascals and sprinkle their blood..

553
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:13,745
..on our hero's cut-out. Is that wrong?

554
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,134
Bravo, brother! You are like pure gold!

555
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:21,007
Don't worry. I'm PK's fan. 
I'm more dangerous than AK47.

556
00:33:21,087 --> 00:33:22,618
Messing with a Power Star's movie..

557
00:33:22,698 --> 00:33:23,991
..is like messing with a power plant.

558
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:25,450
Let's go. Let's teach them a lesson.

559
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,045
No, sir. I don't want 
to cause any trouble to you.

560
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:30,946
Don't worry. We are coming with you. 
You can't say no.

561
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:32,686
(Door bell rings)

562
00:33:35,065 --> 00:33:36,730
Who are you?

563
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:44,297
Search the place. Search every inch. Go.

564
00:33:44,377 --> 00:33:45,670
Okay, sir!

565
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:10,397
(Slaps)

566
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,397
There are two ways to 
watch a newly released movie.

567
00:34:20,662 --> 00:34:22,013
One is to watch it in 
a theater and the other is..

568
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,159
..to watch a pirated copy of it.

569
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,283
We chose the first way. 
You selected the second way.

570
00:34:26,662 --> 00:34:30,218
Once. Just once, 
try to see it our way. Once.

571
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:31,737
I wonder how pirated copies 
are hitting the market..

572
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:33,153
..even before the movie gets released.

573
00:34:34,428 --> 00:34:35,920
I don't know who is doing it.

574
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,364
I get so angry.

575
00:34:39,142 --> 00:34:42,784
We are waging an invisible 
war with an invisible enemy.

576
00:34:43,605 --> 00:34:45,076
Go to the theater to 
watch a movie if possible.

577
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:47,530
Otherwise, 
shut your mouth and sit at home.

578
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,255
But know that we are here.

579
00:34:52,547 --> 00:34:54,060
Forget the man who 
knows how to catch it..

580
00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:56,320
..the man who knows how 
to squeeze it is more important.

581
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:58,590
I'm no longer worried 
that the theater manager..

582
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,190
..won't give us tickets. Done.

583
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,965
Call him.

584
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,727
Okay, sir.

585
00:35:07,122 --> 00:35:08,343
Long live Power Star!

586
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:09,652
Long live Jaani!

587
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,100
Long live Power Star!

588
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,430
Long live Jaani!

589
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,622
Long live Power Star!

590
00:35:13,702 --> 00:35:15,114
Long live Jaani!

591
00:35:15,194 --> 00:35:16,401
Long live Power Star!

592
00:35:48,414 --> 00:35:51,074
You are like pure gold. I hurt you..

593
00:35:52,241 --> 00:35:54,879
..but you saved my reputation 
and also our lives.

594
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,294
I'm very sad that I 
don't have a son like you.

595
00:35:59,862 --> 00:36:01,840
I'm so sorry, Vikranth.

596
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,727
Sir! A student is not 
someone who finishes college..

597
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:06,435
..and walks away with a TC.

598
00:36:06,823 --> 00:36:08,228
He's someone who is willing 
to take care of others..

599
00:36:08,308 --> 00:36:09,461
..as long as he's with them.

600
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:11,180
We are all a family, sir.

601
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,553
Hello! What are you thinking about?

602
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,062
I'm wondering if I should say sorry..

603
00:36:20,365 --> 00:36:24,711
..for getting you suspended 
or thanks for saving my friend.

604
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:27,064
I don't want any of those. 
Just keep smiling like this.

605
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:27,929
No way.

606
00:36:28,837 --> 00:36:30,826
You can keep the smiles, I want a party.

607
00:36:30,906 --> 00:36:32,967
Okay, I'll give you a grand party.

608
00:36:33,172 --> 00:36:34,545
Will you ask me to 
pay the bill at the end?

609
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:35,925
Don't worry about that at all.

610
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,833
Because it is Anagha's 
cousin's engagement party.

611
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:40,595
Please come.

612
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:41,871
Okay.

613
00:37:13,813 --> 00:37:43,181
(Music)

614
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:48,793
"Anagha! Anagha! I dreamt about you"

615
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:53,820
"Anagha! Anagha! I'm with you"

616
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,411
"I wonder how it happened"

617
00:37:58,714 --> 00:38:03,578
"You became a part of me"

618
00:38:04,043 --> 00:38:07,764
"Paradise just dropped to the earth"

619
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:12,175
"It came to me like a smile"

620
00:38:14,132 --> 00:38:17,752
"It is like the waves from a sea of joy"

621
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:22,270
"It drenched me in and out"

622
00:38:24,530 --> 00:39:04,605
(Music)

623
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:09,631
"I met you after a long wait"

624
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:14,734
"It is like I'm standing 
beside a miracle"

625
00:39:14,814 --> 00:39:20,008
"I'm living a hundred 
years in this one moment"

626
00:39:20,088 --> 00:39:25,662
"Should I give a new name 
to the joy inside my heart?"

627
00:39:27,425 --> 00:39:30,539
"Paradise just dropped to the earth"

628
00:39:32,431 --> 00:39:35,577
"It came to me like a smile"

629
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,656
"It is like the waves from a sea of joy"

630
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:42,732
Where are you taking me?

631
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,299
Are you kidnapping me? 
- "It drenched me in and out"

632
00:39:46,379 --> 00:39:47,856
Wait and see.

633
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,190
What is this? Where are we?

634
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:55,611
You'll find out.

635
00:39:56,098 --> 00:39:57,157
Huh? 
- Come.

636
00:39:59,137 --> 00:39:59,796
Come.

637
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:06,099
Be careful.

638
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:16,744
Wow, Vikranth! This is so beautiful.

639
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,788
Did you know about this place before?

640
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:22,090
Where are we?

641
00:40:22,285 --> 00:40:24,966
Switch on the GPS on your 
phone and see for yourself.

642
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:26,598
GPS?

643
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:28,652
Okay.

644
00:40:30,155 --> 00:40:31,376
Unknown island.

645
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,879
This is a nameless island. 
It is very beautiful.

646
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:38,003
So you discovered 
this place like Columbus.

647
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,117
(Laughs)

648
00:41:23,837 --> 00:41:25,135
What are you doing, Vicky?

649
00:41:25,664 --> 00:41:26,529
Hmm.

650
00:41:28,097 --> 00:41:29,026
Sir!

651
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,883
(Laughs)

652
00:41:45,027 --> 00:41:46,822
Anagha Island.

653
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:57,622
Anagha, do you know how much I love you?

654
00:41:57,914 --> 00:41:59,093
As deep as this sea.

655
00:41:59,395 --> 00:42:00,552
As vast as the skies.

656
00:42:00,632 --> 00:42:03,731
As much as the joy 
that is racing in my heart.

657
00:42:03,914 --> 00:42:04,909
I love you, Anagha.

658
00:42:31,776 --> 00:42:33,916
I love you too.

659
00:42:35,743 --> 00:43:26,387
(Music)

660
00:43:26,962 --> 00:43:31,564
"I've put together words 
while thinking about you.."

661
00:43:31,644 --> 00:43:36,552
"..and it came to you 
in the form of a love poem"

662
00:43:36,736 --> 00:43:41,944
"I breathed in fresh 
air while hearing your name.."

663
00:43:42,024 --> 00:43:48,095
"..and it turned into 
life that is flowing in me"

664
00:43:49,264 --> 00:43:52,918
"Paradise just dropped to the earth"

665
00:43:54,258 --> 00:43:57,523
"It came to me like a smile"

666
00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:02,441
"It is like the waves from a sea of joy"

667
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:07,598
"It drenched me in and out"

668
00:44:15,337 --> 00:44:17,240
Stick them to the walls.

669
00:44:17,813 --> 00:44:19,586
You go that side. You go this side.

670
00:44:20,461 --> 00:44:21,629
Don't leave any space on the walls.

671
00:44:22,396 --> 00:44:24,332
Stick them properly.

672
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:25,391
Okay, sir.

673
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:33,313
Come on. 
- Hey, wait.

674
00:44:33,983 --> 00:44:35,540
I'm scared, Vikranth.

675
00:44:36,346 --> 00:44:37,460
Please, I can't come.

676
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,243
Hey, you have nothing to be scared of.

677
00:44:39,323 --> 00:44:40,951
Mom and dad are very jovial persons.

678
00:44:41,031 --> 00:44:42,714
You'll understand it when you meet them.

679
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:44,411
I'm with you. Come on.

680
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:13,839
Yes! 
- We finished first!

681
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,568
We finished first! 
- We finished first!

682
00:45:16,476 --> 00:45:17,566
Vicky! We finished first, didn't we?

683
00:45:17,646 --> 00:45:18,928
Yes, Mom. We finished first.

684
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,680
You tell me, dear. 
Didn't we finish first?

685
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,545
We are first.

686
00:45:21,739 --> 00:45:22,853
No, we are first.

687
00:45:23,047 --> 00:45:23,912
We are first.

688
00:45:23,992 --> 00:45:24,712
We are first.

689
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:25,847
No, we are first.

690
00:45:25,927 --> 00:45:26,723
We are first.

691
00:45:27,545 --> 00:45:28,226
We are first.

692
00:45:28,306 --> 00:45:29,184
We are first.

693
00:45:31,325 --> 00:45:33,714
Mom, she is Anagha..

694
00:45:33,794 --> 00:45:36,211
She is your classmate. 
You like her very much.

695
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:39,758
She likes you too. 
You both are in love. Is that right?

696
00:45:41,293 --> 00:45:43,174
Wait, let him say what he..

697
00:45:43,254 --> 00:45:45,380
Yes, Mom. That's what I wanted to say..

698
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,807
Then listen carefully to me.

699
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,596
I've raised my son with 
a lot of love and affection..

700
00:45:49,676 --> 00:45:51,775
..and I've some expectations 
from his future wife.

701
00:45:52,013 --> 00:45:56,056
Mom, she'll be better 
than your expectations.

702
00:45:56,413 --> 00:45:58,964
Okay, then. I'll ask her 3 questions.

703
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:02,138
If she gives me right answers, 
I'll accept her.

704
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:04,484
You'll play the question 
game in this serious situation?

705
00:46:04,564 --> 00:46:05,609
I'm okay with it, Auntie.

706
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:10,614
First question. I want coffee.

707
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:13,503
Shekhar wants tea. 
What will you make first?

708
00:46:17,763 --> 00:46:18,898
First I'll boil the milk, Auntie.

709
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,392
Second question.

710
00:46:24,246 --> 00:46:26,949
You are traveling through 
a dense forest in a car.

711
00:46:27,338 --> 00:46:28,755
It is raining heavily.

712
00:46:29,284 --> 00:46:31,457
You have only one place in your car.

713
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,820
Shekhar, Vikranth and I'll 
be waiting to catch a ride.

714
00:46:35,004 --> 00:46:37,058
Who will you take in your car?

715
00:46:41,756 --> 00:46:43,129
We'll give the car to you two and..

716
00:46:43,209 --> 00:46:45,692
..we both will come walking, Auntie.

717
00:46:48,967 --> 00:46:49,735
Superb.

718
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:51,054
Third question.

719
00:46:51,437 --> 00:46:52,696
They say that a mother wants 
to satisfy her son's hunger..

720
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:54,112
..but a wife is more 
interested in his wallet.

721
00:46:54,491 --> 00:46:56,091
But what is of interest 
to both mother in law..

722
00:46:56,171 --> 00:46:58,155
..and daughter in law?

723
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,050
Time..

724
00:47:05,299 --> 00:47:06,250
TV serials, Auntie.

725
00:47:08,466 --> 00:47:09,223
Superb, son.

726
00:47:14,768 --> 00:47:19,356
(Laughs)

727
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:22,297
Don't mind me, dear. 
If we are not smart..

728
00:47:22,492 --> 00:47:23,919
..it is very difficult to control them.

729
00:47:24,156 --> 00:47:24,989
Come with me.

730
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:36,504
Your taste is superb, son. 
She's very beautiful.

731
00:47:57,538 --> 00:47:58,587
(Vase shatters)

732
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:07,209
Anagha!

733
00:48:11,038 --> 00:48:11,912
How did it fall?

734
00:48:14,746 --> 00:48:16,054
I told you not to keep it there.

735
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,589
She could've been badly hurt.

736
00:48:17,669 --> 00:48:19,914
Mom, I'll drop Anagha home.

737
00:48:20,854 --> 00:48:22,573
Okay, son. Go safely.

738
00:49:06,904 --> 00:49:08,342
(Sniffs)

739
00:49:13,923 --> 00:49:18,225
(Crying)

740
00:49:31,727 --> 00:49:32,732
What is the MLA's condition?

741
00:49:33,035 --> 00:49:33,911
Very serious, sir.

742
00:49:34,235 --> 00:49:36,505
It can be a big conspiracy.

743
00:49:36,711 --> 00:49:39,781
They used a very dangerous poison. 
It has a name too.

744
00:49:40,062 --> 00:49:40,754
Anthrax.

745
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:42,311
Put the city on high alert.

746
00:49:42,391 --> 00:49:44,235
Do you think the poisoning 
is a political conspiracy?

747
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,408
What is your reaction 
on this as the Health Minister?

748
00:49:46,488 --> 00:49:48,311
This is a very serious situation.

749
00:49:48,722 --> 00:49:52,139
We are investigating 
the case from all angles.

750
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:55,436
The culprits will be punished 
no matter who they are.

751
00:49:58,674 --> 00:50:00,068
Brother! Brother! 
- Yes?

752
00:50:00,148 --> 00:50:01,128
We've to kill someone right now. 
- What happened?

753
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,757
We've to kill him! That's it! 
- Sit down.

754
00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:06,101
A guy hit me in the college.

755
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:07,323
We've to kill him.

756
00:50:07,711 --> 00:50:10,522
I have very high hopes for you..

757
00:50:10,602 --> 00:50:12,089
..but you are determined 
to be a common citizen.

758
00:50:12,306 --> 00:50:16,738
Don't worry. 
Give his details to our men.

759
00:50:16,818 --> 00:50:17,797
They will take care of him.

760
00:50:18,036 --> 00:50:22,901
Go to Mumbai and give them 
these documents and the file.

761
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:24,166
I'll take care of the rest.

762
00:50:28,004 --> 00:50:29,795
He shouldn't be alive when I come back.

763
00:50:33,006 --> 00:50:35,373
Oh dear, how will he live in the future?

764
00:50:35,453 --> 00:50:38,195
(Temple bell ring)

765
00:50:38,508 --> 00:50:39,763
Why are you in such a hurry, Grandma?

766
00:50:39,843 --> 00:50:41,958
Don't worry. God won't run away.

767
00:50:42,336 --> 00:50:44,618
Everyone knows that God won't run away.

768
00:50:44,801 --> 00:50:46,877
That's why all the temples are empty..

769
00:50:47,072 --> 00:50:48,845
..but pubs and clubs are fully packed.

770
00:50:49,104 --> 00:50:51,612
Hurry up. It is time for 
the special prayers. - Hmm.

771
00:51:13,006 --> 00:51:15,549
(Sanskrit chants)

772
00:51:15,629 --> 00:51:17,863
Priest, offer special 
prayers on her name.

773
00:51:35,154 --> 00:51:36,495
What are you doing here?

774
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,765
You can't walk away in 
the middle of a prayer. Let's go.

775
00:51:45,428 --> 00:51:48,282
Grandma! I'll be right back. 
Stay here. Okay?

776
00:51:48,466 --> 00:51:49,471
Where are you going?

777
00:51:51,298 --> 00:51:52,055
Priest!

778
00:51:52,135 --> 00:51:53,082
Yes, dear?

779
00:51:53,162 --> 00:51:55,971
What prayer did you perform just now?

780
00:51:56,051 --> 00:51:58,014
It is not a prayer, dear. 
It is a ritual related to death.

781
00:52:00,036 --> 00:52:02,122
Oh. It must've been for their parents.

782
00:52:02,403 --> 00:52:06,555
No, dear. 
It was for their only son Vikranth.

783
00:52:08,933 --> 00:52:09,841
What?

784
00:52:10,144 --> 00:52:10,977
What did you say his name is?

785
00:52:11,057 --> 00:52:12,696
Vikranth.

786
00:52:29,921 --> 00:52:31,153
Boo!

787
00:52:34,148 --> 00:52:36,450
What's the matter? 
Anything wrong?

788
00:52:37,475 --> 00:52:40,178
I'll ask you a question. 
Will you give me an honest answer?

789
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:43,162
Ask me.

790
00:52:44,621 --> 00:52:47,443
Are your parents your real parents?

791
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:53,508
No, Anagha.

792
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,027
Then?

793
00:52:56,611 --> 00:52:58,254
During the Godavari 
Temple Fair last year..

794
00:52:59,264 --> 00:53:03,751
..I found them lost and crying, 
so I brought them home.

795
00:53:05,437 --> 00:53:09,725
(Laughs)

796
00:53:09,805 --> 00:53:11,682
Vikranth! 
- (Laughs)

797
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:12,893
Vikranth, stop it!

798
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:14,439
Vikranth, please.

799
00:53:14,677 --> 00:53:15,671
Vikranth..

800
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:17,888
Vikranth, stop it!

801
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,228
It is a serious question, 
so don't joke about it.

802
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:27,271
I'm not joking. Your question is a joke.

803
00:53:27,942 --> 00:53:31,281
I saw your mom and dad 
in the temple half an hour ago.

804
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:38,210
They..They did a death 
ritual on your name.

805
00:53:41,194 --> 00:53:44,189
Hey, are you mad? Did you lose it?

806
00:53:44,826 --> 00:53:46,589
I didn't lose it. You've lost it.

807
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:49,140
You are blinded by 
your love for your parents.

808
00:53:50,368 --> 00:53:53,114
I suspected it when the flower 
pot fell down in your house.

809
00:53:53,481 --> 00:53:56,022
Your mom is not an ordinary woman. 
She is wicked.

810
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:57,081
(Slaps)

811
00:53:59,373 --> 00:54:01,254
I won't tolerate it 
if you talk against them.

812
00:54:01,663 --> 00:54:04,344
They are like Gods to me. 
I love them more than my life.

813
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,079
What about me?

814
00:54:08,905 --> 00:54:11,695
Anagha, please. Think with a cool head.

815
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:14,461
Won't they tell me if 
they are going to the temple?

816
00:54:14,786 --> 00:54:16,461
And why will they do 
a death ritual on my name?

817
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:18,223
That sounds so disgusting.

818
00:54:18,991 --> 00:54:20,537
Maybe you were mistaken.

819
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:23,149
Something is definitely not adding up.

820
00:54:24,976 --> 00:54:25,927
I'm really sorry.

821
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,505
Please come out of it.

822
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:32,111
Thank you for understanding me so well. 
I'm sorry.

823
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:41,435
Remember one thing. 
I'm not crazy, Vikranth.

824
00:54:41,738 --> 00:54:43,381
My eyes will never deceive me.

825
00:54:43,976 --> 00:54:48,268
Only God knows the truth.

826
00:55:13,832 --> 00:55:15,578
What's the matter? 
Why are you home so early?

827
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:17,773
You said you are going 
out with your friends.

828
00:55:18,043 --> 00:55:20,183
I came home a while ago. 
Nobody was at home.

829
00:55:20,378 --> 00:55:21,578
Where did you both go?

830
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,502
Your dad's friend Subbarao 
met with an accident.

831
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,547
So we went to the hospital to see him.

832
00:55:27,947 --> 00:55:30,758
All these accidents. 
I'm scared to go out of the house.

833
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:32,931
Is that so? What happened to him?

834
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:36,261
His leg got injured. 
They put him in a cast.

835
00:55:36,544 --> 00:55:38,003
He can't walk for at least one month.

836
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:42,533
Anyway, go call your dad. 
I'll serve food for you both.

837
00:55:42,613 --> 00:55:43,712
Hmm.

838
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:50,164
Sorry, buddy. I can't come out today.

839
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:52,683
I told you I've to go out with my son.

840
00:55:52,763 --> 00:55:54,142
I've to spend time with him.

841
00:55:54,358 --> 00:55:55,710
I'll see you tomorrow. Okay?

842
00:55:56,707 --> 00:55:59,745
When did you come home? 
I'm waiting for you.

843
00:56:00,048 --> 00:56:01,161
Where were you all morning?

844
00:56:01,756 --> 00:56:04,015
My colleague Subbarao 
met with an accident..

845
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,426
..so we went to the hospital to see him.

846
00:56:06,815 --> 00:56:09,380
Nothing serious. Just a small 
hair-line fracture in his hand.

847
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:10,612
He'll be okay.

848
00:56:10,692 --> 00:56:12,526
I'm very hungry. Let's go eat food.

849
00:56:13,023 --> 00:56:15,628
You go ahead. I'll come in a minute. 
- Come soon.

850
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:18,816
Mumbai

851
00:57:28,269 --> 00:57:30,334
Brother, I finished the job. 
I'm coming home.

852
00:57:30,809 --> 00:57:31,977
Do you remember what I told you?

853
00:57:32,341 --> 00:57:33,422
I remember.

854
00:57:33,502 --> 00:57:34,784
Okay. 
- Leave it to me.

855
00:57:34,864 --> 00:57:35,606
Bye.

856
00:57:37,995 --> 00:57:39,184
Hey, stop! Stop!

857
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:49,223
Missing?

858
00:57:49,872 --> 00:57:52,023
1,000,000 rupees 
reward for catching him?

859
00:57:52,743 --> 00:57:55,316
What the! There is definitely 
a mystery behind you.

860
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:03,043
(Brakes squeal)

861
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:12,676
(Door knocks)

862
00:58:13,789 --> 00:58:14,654
We don't need anything, son.

863
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,313
Sir! I'm not here to sell any products.

864
00:58:17,778 --> 00:58:18,611
Who do you want to meet?

865
00:58:18,691 --> 00:58:20,362
The people in the 
photo are my mom and dad.

866
00:58:20,725 --> 00:58:22,617
Based on the serial 
number behind the photo..

867
00:58:22,801 --> 00:58:24,239
..can you give me the 
date and other details..

868
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:27,060
Look, son! 
I shut down the studio 10 years ago.

869
00:58:27,752 --> 00:58:30,271
I don't have any information. Bye, son.

870
00:58:30,769 --> 00:58:31,601
Sir!

871
00:58:35,091 --> 00:58:36,085
Stop!

872
00:58:43,122 --> 00:58:44,916
Are you the one that called? 
- Yes.

873
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:46,592
Come with me.

874
00:58:48,257 --> 00:58:49,953
(Thundering)

875
00:59:04,538 --> 00:59:05,403
Come here.

876
00:59:05,706 --> 00:59:06,711
Wipe yourself.

877
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:08,214
What do you want?

878
00:59:10,306 --> 00:59:11,701
I want the details of this photo, sir.

879
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:14,339
Do you at least know 
the year they got married?

880
00:59:15,258 --> 00:59:21,501
I was born in 1995. 
So it may be 94 or 93.

881
00:59:21,581 --> 00:59:23,663
I'll try to find it. Sit down.

882
00:59:23,743 --> 00:59:24,690
Okay, sir.

883
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:33,277
Tell me. Where is he?

884
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:36,412
Who are you? Why do you want him?

885
00:59:36,714 --> 00:59:38,055
You'll pay 1,000,000 for him?

886
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,406
Hey!

887
00:59:41,285 --> 00:59:43,977
10 million! 10 million rupees!

888
00:59:44,344 --> 00:59:47,501
Don't talk too much. 
Just tell me where he is.

889
00:59:47,581 --> 00:59:49,015
His name is Vikranth.

890
01:00:03,461 --> 01:00:05,678
Boss.

891
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:08,899
Leave me, Boss.

892
01:00:13,046 --> 01:00:14,278
Leave me, Boss.

893
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:16,776
(Phone rings)

894
01:00:16,856 --> 01:00:17,889
(Laughs)

895
01:00:17,969 --> 01:00:18,808
(Phone rings)

896
01:00:18,888 --> 01:00:20,159
Boss, we found him.

897
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:21,576
(Gunshot)

898
01:00:22,931 --> 01:00:24,672
They found him!

899
01:00:24,752 --> 01:00:25,731
(Gunshot)

900
01:00:27,202 --> 01:00:28,823
Kill him!

901
01:00:38,606 --> 01:00:40,130
Tell me the truth! Who are you?

902
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:42,260
How do you know them?

903
01:00:43,081 --> 01:00:44,751
They are really my parents, sir.

904
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:47,140
You can check my driving 
license if you want to.

905
01:00:47,335 --> 01:00:49,173
Where did you get 
that fake license from?

906
01:00:50,394 --> 01:00:51,454
Fake license?

907
01:00:51,627 --> 01:00:53,832
Of course. You said he is your father.

908
01:00:53,912 --> 01:00:56,101
Yes. 
- You said you were born in 1995.

909
01:00:56,523 --> 01:00:58,253
If you were really born in 1995..

910
01:00:58,512 --> 01:01:01,107
..how did I take their 
wedding photos in 1997?

911
01:01:02,101 --> 01:01:03,885
Did your parents get married..

912
01:01:03,965 --> 01:01:05,180
..two years after you were born?

913
01:01:06,758 --> 01:01:08,218
They are not your parents.

914
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:12,985
Get out of here. 
Or I'll have to call the police.

915
01:01:14,131 --> 01:01:14,964
Get out!

916
01:01:22,866 --> 01:01:24,639
I've seen many guys like 
you that stage such dramas..

917
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:28,405
..to get their hands on others' 
wealth and property. Get out!

918
01:01:35,713 --> 01:01:52,443
(Music)

919
01:01:52,616 --> 01:02:03,127
"Did anybody see the 
skies breaking apart?"

920
01:02:05,063 --> 01:02:12,030
"Can you hear the sound 
of a breaking heart?"

921
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:25,644
"When the sweet memories 
of the past stab you.."

922
01:02:27,114 --> 01:02:33,709
"..can you see the 
proof in a broken heart?"

923
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:44,013
"Is my mom's loving morsel just a lie?"

924
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:48,013
"Is my sleeping on my 
dad's chest just a dream?"

925
01:02:48,093 --> 01:02:52,045
"Is this how the lovely 
moon really looks?"

926
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:56,081
"Is this the other face of the truth?"

927
01:02:56,161 --> 01:02:59,940
"A smile turned out 
to be a hidden desert land"

928
01:03:00,124 --> 01:03:03,983
"Love turned out to be 
just a shadow behind the stars"

929
01:03:04,063 --> 01:03:07,963
"How can I have any 
faith in my parents?"

930
01:03:08,043 --> 01:03:13,304
"Is the sea flowing 
out of my eyes like tears?"

931
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:14,774
(Door knocks)

932
01:03:16,525 --> 01:03:17,941
(Door knocks)

933
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:22,449
(Door knocks) 
- Finally he's home.

934
01:03:24,254 --> 01:03:26,081
Auntie, is Vikranth home?

935
01:03:26,258 --> 01:03:27,415
Vikranth is not home..

936
01:03:30,215 --> 01:03:32,755
Vikranth? I don't know. 
You got the wrong address.

937
01:03:36,389 --> 01:03:37,578
What are you doing?

938
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:47,330
Tell me! Where is he?

939
01:04:44,946 --> 01:04:45,951
Hey!

940
01:05:11,298 --> 01:05:12,209
(Gunshot)

941
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:13,993
(Gunshot)

942
01:05:48,321 --> 01:05:50,580
Mom! Mom!

943
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:53,174
(Crying)

944
01:05:53,254 --> 01:05:55,228
Mom! (Crying)

945
01:05:55,974 --> 01:05:57,055
Mom!

946
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,747
Daddy! Daddy!

947
01:05:59,996 --> 01:06:02,147
What happened, Daddy? What is going on?

948
01:06:03,136 --> 01:06:05,720
Son.. Wait a minute.

949
01:06:06,206 --> 01:06:09,709
Let me tell you a truth before I die.

950
01:06:09,789 --> 01:06:12,163
We can talk later. 
Let's go to the hospital first, Daddy.

951
01:06:12,243 --> 01:06:16,043
Listen to me. We don't have much time.

952
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:18,789
You are not our real son.

953
01:06:18,869 --> 01:06:19,837
Who am I, Daddy?

954
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:23,599
Your life is in danger. 
Leave this place immediately.

955
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:26,255
Please, son. Listen to me.

956
01:06:26,335 --> 01:06:28,968
You'll find out everything later. 
First leave.

957
01:06:29,293 --> 01:06:32,028
Don't ask me to go, Daddy. Please.

958
01:06:32,633 --> 01:06:33,714
I love you, son.

959
01:06:33,794 --> 01:06:35,866
(Crying) Daddy.. 
- I love you..

960
01:06:36,562 --> 01:06:38,011
Daddy! Daddy!

961
01:06:38,876 --> 01:06:39,633
Daddy!

962
01:06:39,713 --> 01:06:43,254
(Crying)

963
01:06:43,521 --> 01:06:44,664
(Vehicle approaching)

964
01:06:57,698 --> 01:06:58,703
(Gunshot)

965
01:07:03,795 --> 01:07:06,526
(Gunshot)

966
01:07:24,546 --> 01:07:25,173
(Gunshot)

967
01:07:25,562 --> 01:07:27,162
Faster! Faster!

968
01:07:31,411 --> 01:07:32,244
(Gunshot)

969
01:07:36,176 --> 01:07:38,587
Faster! Faster!

970
01:07:45,255 --> 01:07:48,055
(Tires squealing)

971
01:07:50,379 --> 01:07:51,352
He escaped!

972
01:07:54,066 --> 01:07:54,736
(Gunshot)

973
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:13,989
(Gunshot)

974
01:08:14,595 --> 01:08:15,503
(Gunshot)

975
01:08:16,011 --> 01:08:17,341
(Gunshot)

976
01:08:18,324 --> 01:08:19,351
(Gunshot)

977
01:08:20,572 --> 01:08:21,945
(Gunshot)

978
01:08:22,475 --> 01:08:24,216
(Gunshot)

979
01:08:27,502 --> 01:08:28,649
(Jeep rammed)

980
01:09:06,852 --> 01:09:09,057
Is it? Impossible!

981
01:09:09,371 --> 01:09:10,571
Just few hours back..

982
01:09:10,773 --> 01:09:13,919
..when our men went 
to verify the mass murders..

983
01:09:14,903 --> 01:09:16,232
..that happened in 
a house in Madhurawada..

984
01:09:16,546 --> 01:09:18,265
..they recognized the symbol 
'J' on one of the bodies there.

985
01:09:18,345 --> 01:09:21,173
They confirmed that it 
is Ansari's body and informed us.

986
01:09:21,511 --> 01:09:22,992
Ansari's dead body found in Vizag?

987
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:25,273
Ansari is not just Jehangir's main man..

988
01:09:26,365 --> 01:09:28,657
..the Interpol issued 
a Red Corner notice on him.

989
01:09:29,154 --> 01:09:31,446
Who did you say that 
area's inspector is?

990
01:09:32,099 --> 01:09:36,693
One location. 
Four bullets. Six dead bodies.

991
01:09:37,028 --> 01:09:41,093
Eight stab wounds. 
But only one solution.

992
01:09:42,551 --> 01:09:43,589
This hair.

993
01:09:43,816 --> 01:09:44,681
That is your hair, sir.

994
01:09:45,535 --> 01:09:46,108
Mine?

995
01:09:46,188 --> 01:09:47,114
Yes, sir.

996
01:09:47,676 --> 01:09:48,519
How do you know that?

997
01:09:48,599 --> 01:09:50,843
I was removing it from your shirt..

998
01:09:51,265 --> 01:09:52,195
..but you grabbed it from my hand.

999
01:09:52,275 --> 01:09:53,886
Is this that hair? 
- Yes, sir.

1000
01:09:56,059 --> 01:09:56,892
Sir!

1001
01:09:56,972 --> 01:09:59,800
NIA officer from Hyderabad 
is coming to handle this case.

1002
01:09:59,994 --> 01:10:01,227
They asked you to assist him.

1003
01:10:01,307 --> 01:10:03,216
Why are they sending a NIA 
officer for such a small case?

1004
01:10:06,469 --> 01:10:07,820
How long..

1005
01:10:08,123 --> 01:10:09,107
Sir!

1006
01:10:10,631 --> 01:10:11,809
Are you handling this case?

1007
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,723
Nobody else will be 
able to handle it, sir.

1008
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,694
What are your observations on this case?

1009
01:10:15,986 --> 01:10:17,121
Did you find any clues?

1010
01:10:17,201 --> 01:10:19,867
Sir! I solve the case as 
soon as I see the crime scene.

1011
01:10:20,224 --> 01:10:22,861
This is a piece of cake. 
Just some family problems.

1012
01:10:22,941 --> 01:10:24,987
Around 15 guys came 
and killed the whole family.

1013
01:10:25,067 --> 01:10:27,030
We'll catch them in two or three months.

1014
01:11:07,774 --> 01:11:11,450
Not around 15 men, 
just four or five men.

1015
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:13,147
One member of this family is missing.

1016
01:11:13,904 --> 01:11:15,158
First we've to find him.

1017
01:11:15,915 --> 01:11:18,769
This room is like a 
science-fiction movie set.

1018
01:11:19,353 --> 01:11:21,148
I don't understand this room at all.

1019
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,181
Black belt in karate.

1020
01:11:28,261 --> 01:11:29,932
District champion in boxing.

1021
01:11:30,012 --> 01:11:32,635
Hidden weapons all around the house.

1022
01:11:32,894 --> 01:11:35,251
Looks like they anticipated this attack.

1023
01:11:35,435 --> 01:11:37,761
The house that they lived 
in and the lifestyle they had..

1024
01:11:37,955 --> 01:11:39,155
..are totally different.

1025
01:11:39,609 --> 01:11:40,593
Something fishy.

1026
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:45,242
Tech-guy. Not an ordinary man.

1027
01:11:45,858 --> 01:11:49,039
King of mischief. 
Send the bodies for post-mortem.

1028
01:11:49,288 --> 01:11:50,801
Send the reports to my office. 
- Okay, sir.

1029
01:12:00,137 --> 01:12:01,953
What a horrible death, my brother!

1030
01:12:02,353 --> 01:12:04,559
I'm responsible for your early demise.

1031
01:12:04,861 --> 01:12:07,272
You wouldn't be dead 
if I had killed him that day.

1032
01:12:07,845 --> 01:12:10,307
I won't spare him. I want him.

1033
01:12:11,366 --> 01:12:12,804
I want him!

1034
01:12:13,139 --> 01:12:14,091
Who?

1035
01:12:14,171 --> 01:12:15,410
Durga. A local MLA, sir.

1036
01:12:15,593 --> 01:12:18,188
Where were you? What were you doing?

1037
01:12:18,268 --> 01:12:19,929
I give you four hours time.

1038
01:12:20,429 --> 01:12:23,910
Arrest that guy. Otherwise 
the whole state will be in chaos.

1039
01:12:24,115 --> 01:12:26,504
The dead body will be 
here until you catch him.

1040
01:12:26,584 --> 01:12:28,839
Keep the dead body down. Keep it down.

1041
01:12:29,088 --> 01:12:32,159
We are doing our job. 
Send the body to post-mortem.

1042
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:32,754
Okay, sir.

1043
01:12:32,834 --> 01:12:35,705
Who are you? Do you know who I am?

1044
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,565
I have 300,000 supporters.

1045
01:12:37,738 --> 01:12:38,721
Let me see who will stop me.

1046
01:12:38,801 --> 01:12:42,883
When I find my brother's 
killer I'll shoot him right there.

1047
01:12:42,963 --> 01:12:44,461
You may have thousands of supporters..

1048
01:12:44,541 --> 01:12:46,439
..but I'm responsible 
for 1.2 billion people.

1049
01:12:46,634 --> 01:12:47,693
Take the body.

1050
01:12:47,773 --> 01:12:51,218
Find him. We have to find him first.

1051
01:13:01,513 --> 01:13:02,756
Who are you all?

1052
01:13:04,032 --> 01:13:05,600
Why did you come into my life?

1053
01:13:06,973 --> 01:13:10,032
Why did they mercilessly 
kill my parents?

1054
01:13:10,281 --> 01:13:12,313
Why did you act like 
a crazy man all these days?

1055
01:13:12,393 --> 01:13:13,425
Who are you all?

1056
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:15,403
Who am I?

1057
01:13:17,241 --> 01:13:19,457
I'm not a mad man. I'm your guardian.

1058
01:13:19,976 --> 01:13:23,473
Your servant to keep an eye on you 24/7.

1059
01:13:23,689 --> 01:13:25,397
They were not your real parents.

1060
01:13:25,477 --> 01:13:27,095
You were not their blood.

1061
01:13:27,175 --> 01:13:28,587
Malathi Devi and Chandra Shekhar..

1062
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:31,062
..who you thought were 
your parents all these years..

1063
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:33,800
..were the most wanted 
Naxal leaders in the past.

1064
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,027
You are not Vikranth, 
son of Chandra Shekhar Pasupuleti.

1065
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:43,843
You are Vikranth, 
son of Vikram Simha Uggiraala.

1066
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:51,422
Good evening! 
In the Mumbai bomb blasts case..

1067
01:13:51,502 --> 01:13:53,022
..the police arrested 
the main suspect Ayub..

1068
01:13:53,102 --> 01:13:55,804
..and two others with him this morning.

1069
01:13:56,204 --> 01:13:58,626
You already know that 250 
people were cruelly killed..

1070
01:13:58,706 --> 01:14:00,496
..in the recent bomb blasts.

1071
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,350
The accused were taken 
to Yerawada Jail in Pune.

1072
01:14:03,664 --> 01:14:06,408
The police said that Ayub 
is Mumbai underworld don..

1073
01:14:06,488 --> 01:14:08,808
..Jehangir's brother and 
the heir of his criminal empire.

1074
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:11,921
I told him not to go out in public.

1075
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:13,770
Did he listen to me? What happened now?

1076
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:16,161
They should be out before 
Jehangir sir comes to India.

1077
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:17,891
Otherwise he'll kill me.

1078
01:14:17,971 --> 01:14:19,383
They are not in their in-laws' house.

1079
01:14:19,463 --> 01:14:20,399
They are in Central Jail.

1080
01:14:20,615 --> 01:14:21,848
What do we do now?

1081
01:14:21,928 --> 01:14:25,264
Nobody can save them 
unless they escape from jail.

1082
01:14:59,062 --> 01:14:59,852
Hey!

1083
01:15:02,976 --> 01:15:03,852
Hey!

1084
01:15:07,203 --> 01:15:07,938
Oh no!

1085
01:15:08,743 --> 01:15:10,765
(Keys jangle)

1086
01:15:28,206 --> 01:15:30,875
Hello, brothers!

1087
01:15:32,392 --> 01:15:33,264
(Snaps finger) Here!

1088
01:15:38,161 --> 01:15:39,966
Do you know what a giant wheel is?

1089
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:42,320
I think you know. 
I'm sure you took a ride on it as kids.

1090
01:15:42,514 --> 01:15:45,401
This jail is just like that. 
Once you come in..

1091
01:15:45,481 --> 01:15:46,860
..you can go out only 
when I send you out.

1092
01:15:47,455 --> 01:15:48,741
You can't leave in between.

1093
01:15:49,249 --> 01:15:50,644
You'll die.

1094
01:16:11,074 --> 01:16:11,971
(Whistles)

1095
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:27,492
Mind it!

1096
01:16:38,025 --> 01:16:38,901
Stop it!

1097
01:16:40,533 --> 01:16:43,095
Surrender yourself or I'll shoot you!

1098
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,739
Hey!

1099
01:16:53,819 --> 01:16:57,844
Don't come near. 
Throw the gun. Or I'll kill him.

1100
01:16:57,924 --> 01:16:59,271
I don't care what happens to me, sir.

1101
01:16:59,476 --> 01:17:01,303
It is very dangerous for 
men like him to get out of jail.

1102
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:02,795
Shoot him.

1103
01:17:05,405 --> 01:17:06,421
(Gunshot)

1104
01:17:11,099 --> 01:17:12,342
Shekhar, are you okay? 
- Okay, sir.

1105
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:15,519
Take him to the hospital.

1106
01:17:17,661 --> 01:17:20,148
Shekhar? Don't worry about him, sir.

1107
01:17:20,228 --> 01:17:22,397
I will take care of him. 
Thank you. Thank you so much, sir.

1108
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:24,472
Home Minister.

1109
01:17:25,164 --> 01:17:26,559
You are not an ordinary man.

1110
01:17:26,764 --> 01:17:28,191
You are coolly sitting here..

1111
01:17:28,271 --> 01:17:29,726
..after shooting that 
criminal on the spot.

1112
01:17:30,526 --> 01:17:33,110
But be careful. Your enemy is Jehangir.

1113
01:17:33,304 --> 01:17:35,207
You'll be alright because 
you are from a landlord's family.

1114
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:38,018
If they find that Naxalite, 
they won't spare him.

1115
01:17:38,456 --> 01:17:41,937
That's why I'm sending 
him to a secret location.

1116
01:17:42,017 --> 01:17:42,975
Okay.

1117
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:45,169
Good morning, sir. 
- Yes, please come.

1118
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:46,758
You'll live a hundred years.

1119
01:17:46,838 --> 01:17:47,904
We were just talking about you.

1120
01:17:48,077 --> 01:17:49,202
Sir!

1121
01:17:49,446 --> 01:17:50,992
This is my friend Chakrapani. IG.

1122
01:17:51,072 --> 01:17:52,181
Hello! 
- Hello, sir!

1123
01:17:53,122 --> 01:17:53,911
Are you Shekhar?

1124
01:17:53,991 --> 01:17:55,608
Mr. Chandra Shekhar Azad.

1125
01:17:56,073 --> 01:17:57,165
In his college days, 
he was influenced by..

1126
01:17:57,245 --> 01:17:59,727
..revolutionary ideas, 
so he joined a squad..

1127
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:03,126
..chose non-violence instead 
of violence and rose as a leader.

1128
01:18:03,206 --> 01:18:06,823
And Malathi Devi. 
Martial arts trainer. Sharp shooter.

1129
01:18:06,903 --> 01:18:08,769
She trained about 30 squads.

1130
01:18:09,861 --> 01:18:12,318
After the movement got side-tracked..

1131
01:18:12,664 --> 01:18:14,091
..they couldn't be a part of it, 
they surrendered themselves.

1132
01:18:14,307 --> 01:18:16,707
Don't be surprised, sir. 
That is our sir's talent.

1133
01:18:17,043 --> 01:18:20,513
He has everybody's bio-data in his mind.

1134
01:18:21,151 --> 01:18:23,949
Subbu's bio-data is also 
one of the bio-data's in his brain.

1135
01:18:24,143 --> 01:18:27,408
Yes, madam. I came here 
as a prisoner when I was a kid.

1136
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:30,868
He taught me what life 
is and showed me the right path..

1137
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:32,327
..and made a good man out of me.

1138
01:18:33,157 --> 01:18:35,741
He's my God and I'm his dog.

1139
01:18:35,821 --> 01:18:37,146
Hey, shut up.

1140
01:18:37,341 --> 01:18:38,746
(Laughs)

1141
01:18:38,826 --> 01:18:41,261
We thought we'll be 
in jail all our lives.

1142
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:42,656
But you helped us to be free once again.

1143
01:18:42,736 --> 01:18:44,915
You gave us and our child a new life.

1144
01:18:45,434 --> 01:18:46,818
We'll be forever indebted to you..

1145
01:18:47,077 --> 01:18:49,881
Educate that little boy 
and give him a good life.

1146
01:18:50,173 --> 01:18:50,952
That's enough for me.

1147
01:18:51,032 --> 01:18:52,379
Tomorrow is my son's birthday.

1148
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:54,162
You are going far away.

1149
01:18:54,242 --> 01:18:55,449
I don't know when we'll meet again.

1150
01:18:55,838 --> 01:18:58,087
Come to my son's birthday 
party before leaving.

1151
01:18:58,411 --> 01:19:01,282
Why us, sir? 
Happily spend time with your family.

1152
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,401
Shekhar, you are also my family.

1153
01:19:03,801 --> 01:19:05,898
You are like my brother. 
You are coming. That's it.

1154
01:19:38,127 --> 01:19:41,479
Surprise! Surprise!

1155
01:19:41,559 --> 01:19:45,279
Ten days. I went out 
of town for just ten days..

1156
01:19:46,371 --> 01:19:48,792
..and you gave me such a big surprise.

1157
01:19:50,673 --> 01:19:51,960
After hearing my name..

1158
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:55,391
..15 states spend sleepless nights..

1159
01:19:55,705 --> 01:19:57,629
..4 countries quake with fear..

1160
01:19:58,072 --> 01:20:00,796
..2,000 men wake up in 
their sleep and salute me.

1161
01:20:01,391 --> 01:20:05,220
But I could not save my only brother.

1162
01:20:05,696 --> 01:20:08,345
They shot him down like a dog.

1163
01:20:12,952 --> 01:20:18,888
Who planned to bring him 
out of jail without my knowledge?

1164
01:20:19,417 --> 01:20:20,390
Who is it?

1165
01:20:21,115 --> 01:20:22,120
Who?

1166
01:20:23,286 --> 01:20:24,016
(Gunshot)

1167
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:27,935
Surprise!

1168
01:20:28,918 --> 01:20:31,059
I want the head of 
my brother's murderer..

1169
01:20:31,253 --> 01:20:32,994
..by tomorrow morning.

1170
01:20:33,426 --> 01:20:34,474
Who will bring it?

1171
01:20:34,554 --> 01:20:35,674
I'll bring it.

1172
01:20:46,349 --> 01:20:48,532
I'll bring his head, Father.

1173
01:20:48,921 --> 01:20:51,203
I'll kill the man that killed uncle.

1174
01:20:51,397 --> 01:20:55,257
Bravo, my son! 
You are a tiger born to a tiger!

1175
01:20:55,478 --> 01:20:58,289
The celebration in his 
house should turn into wailing.

1176
01:20:59,564 --> 01:21:02,083
Go, son. Make me proud. Go.

1177
01:21:26,806 --> 01:21:27,697
(Camera clicks)

1178
01:21:29,034 --> 01:21:29,958
(Camera clicks)

1179
01:21:39,451 --> 01:21:41,840
Madam, cake.

1180
01:21:51,209 --> 01:21:53,458
You'll die, you rascal.

1181
01:21:53,538 --> 01:21:55,047
Something is fishy.

1182
01:21:56,852 --> 01:21:57,555
Hey, wait.

1183
01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:00,746
What did you just say?

1184
01:22:12,392 --> 01:22:16,651
(Bomb timer beep)

1185
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:18,779
Hey, stop!

1186
01:22:20,733 --> 01:22:22,397
(Bomb timer beep)

1187
01:22:22,895 --> 01:22:23,792
Who are you?

1188
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,581
What did you just say?

1189
01:22:24,661 --> 01:22:25,727
(Laughs)

1190
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:30,762
(Bomb timer beep)

1191
01:22:31,056 --> 01:22:31,943
Cake!

1192
01:22:32,873 --> 01:22:36,127
(Bomb timer beep)

1193
01:22:36,207 --> 01:22:39,727
(Bomb explosion)

1194
01:22:53,683 --> 01:22:56,440
(Crying)

1195
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:58,883
Mr. Vikram Simha?

1196
01:22:59,348 --> 01:23:02,105
90 percent burns. 
Condition is very critical.

1197
01:23:23,601 --> 01:23:25,374
Will you please promise me something?

1198
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:35,090
Promise me that you'll 
keep him away from all this.

1199
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:47,652
I swear on our love. 
I won't let any harm come to him.

1200
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:53,977
Seetha!

1201
01:23:58,072 --> 01:24:00,883
(Crying)

1202
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:06,521
Vikram Simha! A call for you.

1203
01:24:08,792 --> 01:24:11,462
Surprise! Surprise!

1204
01:24:11,542 --> 01:24:12,559
(Laughs)

1205
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:18,602
Look what a small bullet cost you.

1206
01:24:18,948 --> 01:24:21,857
Poor man, you lost your wife.

1207
01:24:22,283 --> 01:24:26,077
Now take care of your son.

1208
01:24:26,304 --> 01:24:27,893
Your son is in my hands.

1209
01:24:29,461 --> 01:24:33,115
I'll hang him to death, 
put you behind the bars..

1210
01:24:33,442 --> 01:24:34,988
..and make you eat jail food.

1211
01:24:35,068 --> 01:24:37,366
Otherwise I won't be 
called Vikram Simha Uggiraala.

1212
01:24:37,733 --> 01:24:41,582
I'm a forest and you 
are a blade of grass.

1213
01:24:41,831 --> 01:24:43,160
It doesn't matter 
how dense the forest is..

1214
01:24:43,485 --> 01:24:46,026
..a small matchstick can ruin it.

1215
01:24:46,209 --> 01:24:50,750
Touch my son if you have the guts.

1216
01:24:50,830 --> 01:24:52,750
Your ruination will start today.

1217
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,436
Count your time.

1218
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:56,994
(Snaps finger)

1219
01:24:59,334 --> 01:25:03,210
Have you lost it? You have a small son.

1220
01:25:03,394 --> 01:25:05,081
Won't you think about him?

1221
01:25:10,725 --> 01:25:12,757
Shekhar, your son is not dead.

1222
01:25:13,471 --> 01:25:14,844
He is your son from today.

1223
01:25:16,527 --> 01:25:18,895
I'll stay away from him from today.

1224
01:25:19,652 --> 01:25:22,149
Subbu will be with you to help you. 
Please leave.

1225
01:25:23,771 --> 01:25:24,808
Leave.

1226
01:25:26,334 --> 01:25:27,253
Subbu!

1227
01:25:27,333 --> 01:25:28,431
What is this, sir?

1228
01:25:28,961 --> 01:25:29,956
Take care of them.

1229
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:31,512
Okay, sir.

1230
01:25:38,037 --> 01:25:40,253
After hearing the 
arguments of the case..

1231
01:25:40,794 --> 01:25:43,042
..since there is no substantial 
evidence against him..

1232
01:25:43,529 --> 01:25:47,302
..the court finds the 
accused Iqbal not guilty.

1233
01:25:47,805 --> 01:25:50,346
The court gives a 
warning to the police..

1234
01:25:50,638 --> 01:25:53,632
..for arresting an innocent 
16 year old boy in this case..

1235
01:25:53,859 --> 01:25:56,832
..and orders them to 
find the actual culprits.

1236
01:25:57,672 --> 01:25:58,667
Sorry, sir.

1237
01:26:22,347 --> 01:26:23,707
(Brakes squeal)

1238
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:39,704
(Gunshot)

1239
01:26:47,182 --> 01:26:48,371
(Gunshot)

1240
01:26:56,154 --> 01:26:57,008
(Gunshot)

1241
01:26:57,614 --> 01:26:58,803
(Gunshot)

1242
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:03,281
(Gunshot)

1243
01:27:05,302 --> 01:27:06,373
(Gunshot)

1244
01:27:08,243 --> 01:27:09,767
(Gunshot)

1245
01:27:13,836 --> 01:27:16,647
(Explosion)

1246
01:27:22,168 --> 01:27:23,281
My dear boy..

1247
01:27:25,562 --> 01:27:27,162
Sir, we searched everywhere.

1248
01:27:27,497 --> 01:27:30,384
We found this photo, 
but no whereabouts of the kid.

1249
01:27:32,478 --> 01:27:33,743
What a surprise!

1250
01:27:33,823 --> 01:27:36,986
Search. Search every inch.

1251
01:27:37,624 --> 01:27:41,451
Search the whole country. I want him.

1252
01:27:41,531 --> 01:27:44,590
Their souls will not rest in peace..

1253
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:47,422
..until I smear his blood 
on their graves. Find him.

1254
01:27:55,013 --> 01:27:57,478
Jehangir still wants to 
exact revenge after 18 years.

1255
01:27:57,748 --> 01:27:59,456
He is still searching for you.

1256
01:28:00,213 --> 01:28:01,488
He is holding your childhood photo..

1257
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:02,926
..imagining how you will 
look in your adulthood..

1258
01:28:06,469 --> 01:28:08,188
..and frantically searching 
the whole country.

1259
01:28:08,621 --> 01:28:10,610
He has killed men that looked like you.

1260
01:28:13,172 --> 01:28:14,145
He will find you.

1261
01:28:18,353 --> 01:28:21,456
Take this passport. 
There are four visas inside.

1262
01:28:21,759 --> 01:28:24,678
Take those ATM cards. 
Use as much money as you want.

1263
01:28:24,897 --> 01:28:25,870
That's your money.

1264
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:29,795
Go where Jehangir can't find you. 
Take my advice.

1265
01:28:33,081 --> 01:28:34,962
What? I should run away?

1266
01:28:35,473 --> 01:28:37,602
What if he finds me there? 
Should I run again?

1267
01:28:37,862 --> 01:28:40,284
Again and again. How far?

1268
01:28:40,543 --> 01:28:42,586
My parents breathed 
their last in these hands.

1269
01:28:42,911 --> 01:28:45,429
He has turned my life 
upside down in one day.

1270
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:48,041
My dad didn't raise me to be a coward.

1271
01:28:48,121 --> 01:28:49,501
He raised me like a soldier.

1272
01:28:49,717 --> 01:28:51,003
He taught me to fight.

1273
01:28:52,095 --> 01:28:54,355
I won't spare him. I won't.

1274
01:28:54,793 --> 01:28:57,549
I won't run away. I will make him run.

1275
01:28:57,797 --> 01:29:00,716
I will make him curse 
the day he messed with me.

1276
01:29:00,889 --> 01:29:02,802
(Snaps finger) I will show him what 
happens when a naughty boy..

1277
01:29:02,882 --> 01:29:04,327
..turns into a nuclear bomb.

1278
01:29:04,921 --> 01:29:06,835
I don't know who that Vikram Simha is.

1279
01:29:08,002 --> 01:29:09,678
I don't need to know.

1280
01:29:10,031 --> 01:29:14,161
I'm Vikranth, 
son of Chandra Shekhar Pasupuleti.

1281
01:29:16,139 --> 01:29:19,653
Vikranth, don't think 
of going against him all alone.

1282
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:20,847
Listen to me.

1283
01:29:20,927 --> 01:29:22,620
You have known me 
since I was a little kid.

1284
01:29:22,901 --> 01:29:24,053
Is this what you think of me?

1285
01:29:24,301 --> 01:29:26,355
You were with me for 
so long to keep one promise.

1286
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:28,766
You protected me with your life.

1287
01:29:29,015 --> 01:29:30,388
Don't you understand me at all?

1288
01:29:30,468 --> 01:29:31,977
You want me to get scared and run away.

1289
01:29:32,237 --> 01:29:34,486
All these years he has 
been hiding in a hole like a rat.

1290
01:29:34,566 --> 01:29:36,281
That's why nobody could find him.

1291
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:39,676
But now he has to come out for me. 
He has to.

1292
01:29:39,881 --> 01:29:41,330
I'm a trap for him.

1293
01:29:41,924 --> 01:29:44,227
If you still think 
that I'm being foolish..

1294
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,703
..take those cards and leave this city.

1295
01:29:48,081 --> 01:29:50,438
Otherwise stay with me and support me.

1296
01:29:54,345 --> 01:29:55,880
Can I call you uncle?

1297
01:30:05,175 --> 01:30:07,705
I'll tell you everything 
I know about Jehangir.

1298
01:30:08,029 --> 01:30:10,516
You and your friends 
should be very careful.

1299
01:30:11,629 --> 01:30:14,786
He is not a human. 
He is a tiger seeking blood.

1300
01:30:18,431 --> 01:30:19,209
Leave me!

1301
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:22,787
Let me go! I'll never do what you want!

1302
01:30:32,253 --> 01:30:35,745
(Grunts)

1303
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:37,021
Surprise!

1304
01:30:38,228 --> 01:30:40,368
Why do you do only half the job?

1305
01:30:40,448 --> 01:30:44,206
I did everything I could as you said. 
I can't do anything else.

1306
01:30:44,286 --> 01:30:46,412
You didn't do what we want.

1307
01:30:46,779 --> 01:30:50,913
When I used a sample 
of that powder in Hyderabad..

1308
01:30:51,259 --> 01:30:53,713
..not even 100 people died.

1309
01:30:56,134 --> 01:31:01,763
I need more dangerous, 
more lethal, more powerful.

1310
01:31:02,001 --> 01:31:04,898
Aren't you ashamed to 
work for Pakistani dogs..

1311
01:31:04,978 --> 01:31:06,260
..being an Indian?

1312
01:31:07,179 --> 01:31:11,146
Hey, please surprise him. Surprise him.

1313
01:31:11,226 --> 01:31:14,984
(Laughs)

1314
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:23,730
(Screams)

1315
01:31:29,616 --> 01:31:32,373
Who wants the next surprise?

1316
01:31:33,378 --> 01:31:37,681
Don't kill us. 
Don't kill us. We will do as you say.

1317
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:39,735
We'll create what you want.

1318
01:31:40,872 --> 01:31:41,769
What will you make?

1319
01:31:41,849 --> 01:31:44,893
The most dangerous of bio-weapons.

1320
01:31:45,693 --> 01:31:47,012
Botulinum Toxin.

1321
01:31:47,092 --> 01:31:51,457
Wow! Botulinum Toxin! I want that! 
(Gunshot)

1322
01:31:51,663 --> 01:31:54,992
Jehangir Kazgar. 
None of us need an introduction.

1323
01:31:55,295 --> 01:31:57,295
He holds the second place in..

1324
01:31:57,619 --> 01:31:58,679
..World's Ten Most Wanted Criminals.

1325
01:31:58,917 --> 01:32:02,243
He is the main accused 
in serial bomb blasts in 1995.

1326
01:32:02,588 --> 01:32:03,507
Ever since he lost his brother in 1997..

1327
01:32:03,587 --> 01:32:07,550
..while he was escaping from jail and..

1328
01:32:08,058 --> 01:32:09,715
..lost his son in an accident..

1329
01:32:10,169 --> 01:32:13,705
..he has been careful 
to hide his existence..

1330
01:32:13,785 --> 01:32:15,405
..and expanded his criminal empire.

1331
01:32:15,578 --> 01:32:18,140
According to the intelligence from..

1332
01:32:18,508 --> 01:32:19,956
..the United States 
Treasury Department..

1333
01:32:20,151 --> 01:32:21,546
..we came to know that 
he is in good terms..

1334
01:32:21,626 --> 01:32:23,037
..with some terrorist 
groups in Pakistan.

1335
01:32:23,472 --> 01:32:25,807
He has been deceiving 
many countries for so long..

1336
01:32:25,887 --> 01:32:28,456
..but he has been spotted 
in Vizag recently.

1337
01:32:28,867 --> 01:32:30,791
Do you think Jehangir 
has connections with Ansari..

1338
01:32:31,115 --> 01:32:33,353
..whose body was found in Vizag?

1339
01:32:33,433 --> 01:32:36,465
Yes. This might sound 
like a strange story.

1340
01:32:36,545 --> 01:32:38,962
After killing Jehangir's 
brother and son in 1998..

1341
01:32:39,546 --> 01:32:41,416
..Jail Superintendent Vikram Simha..

1342
01:32:41,496 --> 01:32:44,097
..lost his life too 
in the same incident.

1343
01:32:44,627 --> 01:32:46,405
His son Vikranth and 
the son of Chandra Shekhar..

1344
01:32:46,485 --> 01:32:50,210
..and Malathi Devi who 
were killed in Vizag, are one.

1345
01:32:50,859 --> 01:32:52,913
Jehangir must have attacked 
that youth's house..

1346
01:32:53,594 --> 01:32:55,735
..with the intention 
of exacting revenge.

1347
01:32:55,815 --> 01:32:57,351
Since Vikranth's body was not found..

1348
01:32:57,431 --> 01:32:58,757
..maybe he was kidnapped.

1349
01:32:59,038 --> 01:33:02,876
No. He is not an innocent 
youth as we think.

1350
01:33:03,081 --> 01:33:05,124
He is very good at using technology.

1351
01:33:05,204 --> 01:33:07,652
We don't know how he 
escaped from this attack.

1352
01:33:07,976 --> 01:33:10,993
But we have evidence 
that somebody helped him.

1353
01:33:12,268 --> 01:33:14,095
The night that incident 
took place in Vizag..

1354
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,366
..he passed through the 
toll-gates towards Hyderabad..

1355
01:33:16,722 --> 01:33:19,436
..with another man 
as shown in the picture.

1356
01:33:20,593 --> 01:33:25,879
Jehangir and his men 
will try to find this youth.

1357
01:33:26,225 --> 01:33:27,836
This is the right time for us.

1358
01:33:29,206 --> 01:33:31,509
It is very important to 
find out Jehangir's whereabouts..

1359
01:33:32,179 --> 01:33:34,417
..and it is equally important 
to protect this youth.

1360
01:33:34,731 --> 01:33:36,017
Now the questions before us are..

1361
01:33:36,097 --> 01:33:38,374
..Who helped that youth to escape? 
Where is he now?

1362
01:33:38,811 --> 01:33:41,362
Find him. Search every nook and corner.

1363
01:33:41,557 --> 01:33:42,768
Mr. Vittal! 
- Yes, sir!

1364
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:45,935
I want all the details 
about the dead Vikram Simha.

1365
01:33:46,015 --> 01:33:46,660
Okay, sir.

1366
01:33:46,865 --> 01:33:47,589
Be on that mission.

1367
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:48,919
Yes, sir!

1368
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:50,926
(TV switch on)

1369
01:33:51,575 --> 01:33:53,099
Hello, Jehangir!

1370
01:33:53,391 --> 01:33:54,624
Hello!

1371
01:33:54,883 --> 01:33:57,186
Our men have been waiting for years..

1372
01:33:57,607 --> 01:34:00,111
..for the operation that 
you'll be doing in India.

1373
01:34:01,106 --> 01:34:04,003
But you haven't started it yet.

1374
01:34:04,187 --> 01:34:05,917
My operation is so powerful..

1375
01:34:06,089 --> 01:34:07,681
..that you haven't seen 
or heard anything like it before.

1376
01:34:08,113 --> 01:34:10,016
When I use that weapon..

1377
01:34:10,492 --> 01:34:12,686
..not just tens, hundreds or thousands..

1378
01:34:13,075 --> 01:34:15,886
..but millions of people 
will lose their lives.

1379
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:17,247
Surprising?

1380
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:18,480
(Laughs)

1381
01:34:18,869 --> 01:34:20,653
Dr. Khan, please come.

1382
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,161
Biological weapons. 
Harmful biological agents.

1383
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:26,923
Instead of fighting 
with guns and bombs..

1384
01:34:27,474 --> 01:34:30,145
..they use bacteria 
and virus as weapons..

1385
01:34:30,225 --> 01:34:33,377
..and their main goal is 
to kill countless people at once.

1386
01:34:33,561 --> 01:34:35,723
One is Botulinum Toxin.

1387
01:34:37,109 --> 01:34:41,757
Just one gram of it can kill 
at least 1 to 1.5 million people.

1388
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:46,590
With this operation, 
my name will create history and..

1389
01:34:46,844 --> 01:34:50,379
..and I will have a 
permanent place in heaven.

1390
01:34:50,459 --> 01:34:52,109
Bravo, Jehangir!

1391
01:34:52,401 --> 01:34:56,131
We can stand proudly 
before God because of you.

1392
01:34:56,325 --> 01:34:59,956
We will meet you there 
in a week or ten days.

1393
01:35:00,702 --> 01:35:01,566
Bye.

1394
01:35:01,646 --> 01:35:03,588
(Door creak)

1395
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:23,834
I miss you so much.

1396
01:35:24,526 --> 01:35:25,628
I miss you.

1397
01:35:29,472 --> 01:35:31,872
We got rid of our phones as you said. 
What's next?

1398
01:35:35,732 --> 01:35:37,072
Use these from today.

1399
01:35:38,067 --> 01:35:41,631
Our phones may be tapped. 
We have to be careful.

1400
01:35:42,474 --> 01:35:43,869
What do you want to do now?

1401
01:35:44,723 --> 01:35:45,653
Hunt.

1402
01:35:46,226 --> 01:35:47,555
I want to hunt.

1403
01:35:47,836 --> 01:35:51,717
I will hunt down the wild 
beast that has been in hiding..

1404
01:35:51,911 --> 01:35:54,387
..and bring peace to 
the souls of my parents.

1405
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,819
Listen to me, darling.

1406
01:35:57,317 --> 01:36:00,830
It is not safe here. 
Go back to your parents.

1407
01:36:01,314 --> 01:36:03,131
I'll come to you once 
I get this job done.

1408
01:36:03,211 --> 01:36:06,158
Being with you is the safest 
place for me on this earth.

1409
01:36:08,136 --> 01:36:14,560
My life and death is with you. 
I can't stay away from you.

1410
01:36:15,101 --> 01:36:30,337
(Music)

1411
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:37,959
"Should I spread my life 
down so that you can walk on it?"

1412
01:36:38,039 --> 01:36:45,130
"Should I walk with 
you with a million hopes?"

1413
01:36:45,574 --> 01:36:53,126
"I've been born on this earth for you"

1414
01:36:53,206 --> 01:37:00,585
"I won't leave your side 
until death takes me away"

1415
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:08,432
"Should I spread my life 
down so that you can walk on it?"

1416
01:37:08,512 --> 01:37:16,400
"Should I walk with 
you with a million hopes?"

1417
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:38,576
(Music)

1418
01:37:38,781 --> 01:37:42,531
"My heart condemns 
me when I'm not with you"

1419
01:37:42,611 --> 01:37:46,152
"It is constantly filled 
with your thoughts"

1420
01:37:46,336 --> 01:37:50,250
"It is my prisoner now, safe with me"

1421
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:53,644
"It has filled me abounding joy"

1422
01:37:53,941 --> 01:37:57,422
"Let me stay with 
you for a hundred years"

1423
01:37:57,502 --> 01:38:01,271
"Let me prove to you that 
I'll give my life for you"

1424
01:38:01,351 --> 01:38:05,085
"Though I'm surrounded by darkness.."

1425
01:38:05,165 --> 01:38:08,879
"..your eyes are a lamp for me"

1426
01:38:08,959 --> 01:38:12,803
"Though sadness overtakes me.."

1427
01:38:13,009 --> 01:38:16,944
"..your love is a 
path strewn with flowers"

1428
01:38:17,024 --> 01:38:24,576
"Should I spread my life 
down so that you can walk on it?"

1429
01:38:24,656 --> 01:38:32,544
"Should I walk with 
you with a million hopes?"

1430
01:38:32,624 --> 01:38:39,989
(Music)

1431
01:38:51,701 --> 01:38:55,971
Wow! My Hyderabad! 
This place smells so good.

1432
01:38:57,410 --> 01:39:01,226
(Laughs)

1433
01:39:07,389 --> 01:39:09,314
Did you see how great God is?

1434
01:39:09,765 --> 01:39:11,678
I've travelled all around the world..

1435
01:39:11,992 --> 01:39:14,500
..but He made me come to Hyderabad..

1436
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:17,927
..for the two most 
important works in my life.

1437
01:39:18,435 --> 01:39:21,456
One is to start our operation.

1438
01:39:21,812 --> 01:39:22,569
Second is..

1439
01:39:22,796 --> 01:39:24,623
Forgive me. Please forgive me.

1440
01:39:24,991 --> 01:39:28,672
Nobody has ever escaped 
from me till now.

1441
01:39:28,866 --> 01:39:32,899
It happened for the first time. 
Someone is helping him.

1442
01:39:33,147 --> 01:39:36,391
Someone is helping him. 
Just give me one more chance.

1443
01:39:36,585 --> 01:39:37,375
What will you do?

1444
01:39:37,455 --> 01:39:40,369
I'll take the help of 
all our men in the market and..

1445
01:39:40,553 --> 01:39:43,945
..find that guy no 
matter where he's hiding.

1446
01:39:44,025 --> 01:39:45,404
I'll drag him here 
and throw him at your feet.

1447
01:39:45,484 --> 01:39:46,842
(Laughs)

1448
01:39:46,922 --> 01:39:48,485
I'll wait for your surprise.

1449
01:39:54,584 --> 01:39:57,038
Hey! Welcome my dear scientists.

1450
01:39:57,118 --> 01:39:58,854
(Laughs)

1451
01:39:58,934 --> 01:40:01,913
Consider this your house from today.

1452
01:40:02,486 --> 01:40:05,021
You have exactly ten days time.

1453
01:40:05,101 --> 01:40:07,107
Then we'll test one sample.

1454
01:40:07,388 --> 01:40:10,826
A minimum of 1,000 people should die.

1455
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:13,626
Then I will let you go home.

1456
01:40:19,690 --> 01:40:20,468
Jehangir!

1457
01:40:21,398 --> 01:40:23,506
Nobody has seen him 
in the past 15 years..

1458
01:40:23,586 --> 01:40:24,873
..but no matter which 
country he goes to..

1459
01:40:24,953 --> 01:40:26,246
..he has a big network there.

1460
01:40:26,494 --> 01:40:29,359
His men are everywhere 
and they do his work.

1461
01:40:29,846 --> 01:40:34,181
And the one in Hyderabad is Rasul.

1462
01:40:34,527 --> 01:40:37,741
Land grabbing, 
illegal weapons, human trafficking..

1463
01:40:38,758 --> 01:40:39,990
..are his businesses.

1464
01:40:40,498 --> 01:40:43,752
It took a lot of effort 
to get a chance to meet him.

1465
01:41:07,158 --> 01:41:09,287
Who are you? What do you want?

1466
01:41:09,367 --> 01:41:10,314
Jehangir's details.

1467
01:41:10,394 --> 01:41:11,806
You are asking me as easily 
as going to the bank and..

1468
01:41:11,886 --> 01:41:13,276
..asking for new 2,000 rupee notes.

1469
01:41:13,356 --> 01:41:15,266
Did you see Jehangir's face any time?

1470
01:41:15,346 --> 01:41:16,358
(Gunshot)

1471
01:41:16,544 --> 01:41:19,042
(Groans)

1472
01:41:19,842 --> 01:41:22,782
Don't kill me. Please. Please..

1473
01:41:22,862 --> 01:41:26,058
Not just me, nobody knows about him.

1474
01:41:26,138 --> 01:41:29,144
He gets in touch only 
when he has some work with us.

1475
01:41:29,392 --> 01:41:31,284
Who comes to you? Where does he meet?

1476
01:41:31,364 --> 01:41:34,181
Bikku. Jehangir's main man.

1477
01:41:34,495 --> 01:41:36,862
Where is he meeting next? Answer me!

1478
01:41:37,198 --> 01:41:38,019
Will you answer me or no?

1479
01:41:38,099 --> 01:41:39,510
He'll come to Monda Market next Friday.

1480
01:41:39,888 --> 01:41:41,240
I don't know anything else.

1481
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:43,445
I won't leave until I find him.

1482
01:41:43,759 --> 01:41:45,564
You are being observed by the NIA.

1483
01:41:45,644 --> 01:41:48,613
I won't sleep until I kill 
the man that killed my brother.

1484
01:41:48,845 --> 01:41:51,494
If you mess this up, 
you will lose your MLA post..

1485
01:41:51,574 --> 01:41:52,369
..and your life.

1486
01:41:53,699 --> 01:41:56,164
It is not good to get 
involved in this matter.

1487
01:41:56,899 --> 01:41:59,288
Give the job of finding 
him to someone else.

1488
01:41:59,567 --> 01:42:01,264
That's right. Elections are coming up.

1489
01:42:01,344 --> 01:42:02,669
We can't take such risks at this time.

1490
01:42:03,091 --> 01:42:05,351
I know someone who does such jobs, sir.

1491
01:42:06,464 --> 01:42:07,145
Who is he?

1492
01:43:00,395 --> 01:43:02,510
Stop doing petty 
thieveries and burglaries.

1493
01:43:02,921 --> 01:43:03,623
So be it.

1494
01:43:03,703 --> 01:43:05,353
You should be saying okay.

1495
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:08,218
Oh, okay.

1496
01:43:08,488 --> 01:43:09,440
Okay.

1497
01:43:09,775 --> 01:43:11,450
Here, boss. We have to find him.

1498
01:43:32,409 --> 01:43:33,836
Just wait.

1499
01:43:42,114 --> 01:43:43,444
Come on. Give me something.

1500
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:51,254
Monda Market. According to this map..

1501
01:43:51,524 --> 01:43:52,995
..there are three ways into the market.

1502
01:43:53,492 --> 01:43:56,573
If one person can coordinate 
from this tall building..

1503
01:43:57,103 --> 01:43:59,481
..three of us can guard  
these three ways.

1504
01:43:59,561 --> 01:44:01,211
But we've to be very careful.

1505
01:44:01,291 --> 01:44:02,984
We shouldn't miss him at any cost.

1506
01:44:03,157 --> 01:44:05,330
Bablu will keep an 
eye from this building.

1507
01:44:05,633 --> 01:44:08,465
I'll be at Exit A. 
Anagha will be at Exit B..

1508
01:44:10,001 --> 01:44:11,082
..and uncle will be at Exit C.

1509
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:13,807
No matter which way he uses to enter..

1510
01:44:14,034 --> 01:44:16,023
..it will take us 
ten minutes to meet up.

1511
01:44:16,103 --> 01:44:18,499
We should follow him 
closely in those ten minutes.

1512
01:44:18,705 --> 01:44:20,673
We all will be connected 
by a Bluetooth conference call.

1513
01:44:20,753 --> 01:44:22,705
The police are searching for us.

1514
01:44:23,127 --> 01:44:24,446
So we should be very careful.

1515
01:44:28,435 --> 01:44:30,642
Bablu! Are you fully alert?

1516
01:44:30,722 --> 01:44:31,745
Yes, I'm alert.

1517
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:35,540
Okay. Anagha! Uncle! Are you alert?

1518
01:44:36,718 --> 01:44:38,599
I'm ready. 
Don't worry about this entrance.

1519
01:44:38,837 --> 01:44:41,018
As far as I know, 
he'll avoid this open entrance.

1520
01:44:41,098 --> 01:44:44,456
Once he enters inside, 
we'll be onto him.

1521
01:44:44,694 --> 01:44:45,937
But be attentive.

1522
01:44:51,492 --> 01:44:53,081
Guys! Enter the Dragon!

1523
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:54,573
Are you sure?

1524
01:44:54,653 --> 01:44:56,065
I'm a bit doubtful.

1525
01:44:56,562 --> 01:44:59,254
Entrance B, Anagha. 
Follow the black dress bald man.

1526
01:44:59,741 --> 01:45:01,583
Anagha, look at his face and confirm.

1527
01:45:45,348 --> 01:45:47,208
Vikranth, that's Bikku.

1528
01:45:48,646 --> 01:45:49,521
I'm sure.

1529
01:45:49,601 --> 01:45:52,116
Listen, be careful. 
Don't let him see you.

1530
01:45:58,267 --> 01:45:59,867
Guys, we should not lose him.

1531
01:45:59,947 --> 01:46:01,748
Bablu, take the bike, 
come here immediately.

1532
01:46:02,194 --> 01:46:03,491
I'm coming. On my way.

1533
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:07,470
Uncle, we shouldn't 
lose him at any cost.

1534
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:08,615
I'll take care of it.

1535
01:46:10,907 --> 01:46:12,313
Excuse me.

1536
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:20,103
Do you have a lighter?

1537
01:46:38,301 --> 01:46:38,960
Uncle!

1538
01:46:41,133 --> 01:46:41,912
Uncle!

1539
01:46:43,036 --> 01:46:43,706
Uncle!

1540
01:46:44,646 --> 01:46:45,684
I won't let anything happen to you.

1541
01:46:45,976 --> 01:46:49,252
Uncle! Uncle! Get up. You'll be alright.

1542
01:46:49,332 --> 01:46:51,219
Uncle! Uncle!

1543
01:46:52,117 --> 01:46:54,084
Uncle! Uncle!

1544
01:46:54,927 --> 01:46:55,695
Uncle!

1545
01:46:58,064 --> 01:47:01,437
(Crying)

1546
01:47:01,517 --> 01:47:02,864
Uncle..

1547
01:47:11,299 --> 01:47:16,748
(Phone rings)

1548
01:47:17,728 --> 01:47:18,496
Tell me.

1549
01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:20,798
Buddy, I took all his 
things from the hospital.

1550
01:47:21,869 --> 01:47:23,112
But I couldn't find his phone. 
It is missing.

1551
01:47:23,306 --> 01:47:24,193
Did you check properly?

1552
01:47:24,388 --> 01:47:28,089
I checked. 
I think it got lost in the market.

1553
01:47:28,169 --> 01:47:29,148
In the market?

1554
01:47:32,911 --> 01:47:34,673
Oh crap! Something is wrong.

1555
01:47:35,278 --> 01:47:36,565
Anagha, come fast. 
- What happened, Vicky?

1556
01:47:36,645 --> 01:47:38,051
This place is not safe for us.

1557
01:47:38,131 --> 01:47:39,056
What's wrong? 
- Hurry up.

1558
01:47:39,705 --> 01:47:40,883
(Door knocks)

1559
01:47:41,547 --> 01:47:43,039
(Door knocks)

1560
01:47:43,796 --> 01:47:44,963
(Door knocks)

1561
01:47:45,223 --> 01:47:47,028
(Door knocks)

1562
01:47:48,044 --> 01:47:48,952
(Gasps)

1563
01:47:49,125 --> 01:47:51,493
(Door knocks)

1564
01:47:55,491 --> 01:47:56,237
Go, go, go.

1565
01:47:56,317 --> 01:47:57,426
Vicky, be careful. 
- Go, go, go.

1566
01:47:58,172 --> 01:47:59,383
Don't come out until I call you.

1567
01:48:26,115 --> 01:48:27,618
(Gunshot)

1568
01:48:56,459 --> 01:49:02,675
(Phone rings)

1569
01:49:02,978 --> 01:49:04,232
Unknown number?

1570
01:49:04,827 --> 01:49:06,348
Why aren't you answering your phone?

1571
01:49:06,428 --> 01:49:07,526
Did you get drunk and go to sleep?

1572
01:49:07,721 --> 01:49:08,359
Hey!

1573
01:49:09,202 --> 01:49:11,969
He didn't go to sleep, 
I put him to sleep.

1574
01:49:13,321 --> 01:49:14,369
Surprised?

1575
01:49:14,856 --> 01:49:17,660
I'm sure you recognized me. Vikranth.

1576
01:49:18,103 --> 01:49:20,211
Enemy of Jehangir Kazgar.

1577
01:49:22,654 --> 01:49:25,725
Wow, what a surprise.

1578
01:49:27,047 --> 01:49:29,274
You've outdone your father.

1579
01:49:29,901 --> 01:49:33,382
The account that your 
father opened 18 years ago..

1580
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:35,317
..will close with your death.

1581
01:49:35,397 --> 01:49:36,041
Hey!

1582
01:49:36,863 --> 01:49:38,966
Hey! We haven't settled 
the balance in that account yet.

1583
01:49:39,377 --> 01:49:40,955
That will be settled with your death.

1584
01:49:41,035 --> 01:49:46,555
You are a kid. 
Try to save your life. Run away.

1585
01:49:46,635 --> 01:49:50,800
Jehangir, 
I'm not an innocent college kid.

1586
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:54,022
My father raised me 
to be an invincible warrior.

1587
01:49:55,622 --> 01:49:59,718
Your time starts now. 
Count your last minutes.

1588
01:50:00,161 --> 01:50:04,972
(Snaps finger)

1589
01:50:27,131 --> 01:50:28,558
Why did you put the GPS in his mouth?

1590
01:50:28,638 --> 01:50:30,407
Now we can control his every move.

1591
01:50:46,057 --> 01:50:46,533
Yes, sir.

1592
01:50:46,613 --> 01:50:47,679
I need you to go to Kerala immediately.

1593
01:50:47,759 --> 01:50:49,463
Just follow my instructions. Okay?

1594
01:50:49,543 --> 01:50:50,663
Okay, sir. 
- Come on, go ahead.

1595
01:50:51,155 --> 01:50:54,690
We are going to reach 
our goal in one week.

1596
01:50:54,770 --> 01:50:57,112
We have to be very careful.

1597
01:50:57,555 --> 01:51:01,793
The NIA, CID, Task Force, Octopus..

1598
01:51:02,273 --> 01:51:05,106
..are trying very hard to find us.

1599
01:51:05,186 --> 01:51:07,073
It is your duty to make 
sure that our leaders..

1600
01:51:07,153 --> 01:51:12,197
..coming from Pakistan 
won't face any inconveniences.

1601
01:51:18,370 --> 01:51:19,473
Wow!

1602
01:51:19,553 --> 01:51:20,479
(Laughs)

1603
01:51:20,559 --> 01:51:22,273
What a pleasant surprise!

1604
01:51:22,593 --> 01:51:25,425
I have been feeding you 
for years for this very task.

1605
01:51:26,398 --> 01:51:28,971
He is just a kid who doesn't 
even have a moustache yet..

1606
01:51:29,425 --> 01:51:31,468
..and you let him escape.

1607
01:51:31,674 --> 01:51:33,177
There's only one punishment for it.

1608
01:51:34,708 --> 01:51:35,660
(Gunshot)

1609
01:51:39,368 --> 01:51:40,362
(Laughs)

1610
01:51:40,442 --> 01:51:42,232
What an ultimate surprise for me!

1611
01:51:42,312 --> 01:51:44,135
(Laughs)

1612
01:51:44,555 --> 01:51:47,273
Bury him behind the bungalow.

1613
01:51:47,955 --> 01:51:49,998
Call Anthony!

1614
01:51:50,484 --> 01:51:51,901
Come on, Anthony!

1615
01:52:10,743 --> 01:52:11,802
Banjara Hills!

1616
01:52:15,019 --> 01:52:16,544
Where did we come?

1617
01:52:17,733 --> 01:52:20,630
Oh no! What is this place? 
Looks like a forest.

1618
01:52:21,322 --> 01:52:22,717
Is that man a Naxalite?

1619
01:52:22,895 --> 01:52:24,754
The GPS is pointing to this place.

1620
01:52:24,834 --> 01:52:26,127
Something is fishy.

1621
01:52:27,586 --> 01:52:28,959
I think someone is coming. Let's hide.

1622
01:52:29,164 --> 01:52:30,029
Come.

1623
01:52:43,101 --> 01:52:43,901
Come on.

1624
01:52:46,171 --> 01:52:48,128
A security point in 
such a remote location?

1625
01:52:48,501 --> 01:52:50,155
I'm sure he's inside.

1626
01:52:52,036 --> 01:52:54,890
You both stay in the van 
till I come back. Take care.

1627
01:52:55,323 --> 01:52:56,058
Okay.

1628
01:52:58,318 --> 01:52:59,120
(Horn blares)

1629
01:53:01,423 --> 01:53:02,461
Open the gate!

1630
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:17,783
(Brakes squeal)

1631
01:53:20,378 --> 01:53:22,691
Hello, sir! Welcome to India.

1632
01:53:28,942 --> 01:53:32,056
Jehangir! We are happy to meet you.

1633
01:53:32,136 --> 01:53:33,515
(Laughs)

1634
01:53:33,595 --> 01:53:36,748
All our brothers in the 
world are looking to you.

1635
01:53:37,226 --> 01:53:39,896
Everyone is talking about the operation.

1636
01:53:39,976 --> 01:53:42,220
(Laughs)

1637
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:43,810
Thank you. Thank you.

1638
01:53:44,199 --> 01:53:45,712
In exactly one week..

1639
01:53:45,792 --> 01:53:49,147
..the bio-chemical 
gas that we are making..

1640
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:54,002
..will spread in the air to 
turn this country into a graveyard.

1641
01:53:54,082 --> 01:53:55,245
(Laughs)

1642
01:53:55,325 --> 01:53:56,520
Very good.

1643
01:53:58,131 --> 01:54:03,644
We arranged two Bollywood 
stars to entertain you.

1644
01:54:03,724 --> 01:54:05,331
Bollywood stars? 
- Two Bollywood stars?

1645
01:54:05,411 --> 01:54:07,244
Who? 
- It's a surprise!

1646
01:54:07,597 --> 01:54:24,640
(Music)

1647
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:25,721
"Come on!"

1648
01:54:25,889 --> 01:54:34,332
(Music)

1649
01:54:34,412 --> 01:54:38,656
"Oh no! He's calling me"

1650
01:54:41,326 --> 01:54:45,596
"Naughty man! Naughty man!"

1651
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:50,109
"Oh no! I don't know what to do"

1652
01:54:52,736 --> 01:54:57,082
"Naughty man! Naughty man!"

1653
01:54:57,328 --> 01:55:01,868
"He doesn't leave when I ask him to"

1654
01:55:01,948 --> 01:55:06,063
"He is filled with mischievous thoughts"

1655
01:55:06,344 --> 01:55:10,951
"He says he likes my smile"

1656
01:55:11,031 --> 01:55:15,287
"But he doesn't care 
about my good qualities"

1657
01:55:15,367 --> 01:55:19,932
"Hey! Hey, Mister! Hug me tightly"

1658
01:55:20,012 --> 01:55:24,937
"Hey! Hey, Mister! Kill me sweetly"

1659
01:55:25,017 --> 01:56:01,105
(Music)

1660
01:56:01,185 --> 01:56:03,451
"Why do you look at me like that?"

1661
01:56:03,531 --> 01:56:05,516
"Will you come to me?"

1662
01:56:05,596 --> 01:56:08,116
"Why are you running in a hurry?"

1663
01:56:08,196 --> 01:56:09,997
"Will you shut the doors?"

1664
01:56:10,077 --> 01:56:14,630
"Ready the love car, let's speed it up"

1665
01:56:14,710 --> 01:56:19,505
"Show me you strength, 
be naughty with me"

1666
01:56:19,585 --> 01:56:23,916
"Let's feed each other with kisses"

1667
01:56:24,111 --> 01:56:28,680
"Let's satisfy our raging 
lust with this sweetness"

1668
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:33,221
"Hey! Hey, Mister! Hug me tightly"

1669
01:56:33,301 --> 01:56:37,837
"Hey! Hey, Mister! 
Tackle with me sweetly"

1670
01:56:37,917 --> 01:57:14,135
(Music)

1671
01:57:14,215 --> 01:57:18,687
"You can't buy this 
happiness with money"

1672
01:57:18,767 --> 01:57:23,255
"Your manliness gives 
me the utmost pleasure"

1673
01:57:23,335 --> 01:57:27,785
"Let's wage a war until 
one of us comes out victorious"

1674
01:57:27,865 --> 01:57:32,614
"Let's blow a victory trumpet together"

1675
01:57:32,694 --> 01:57:37,252
"Taking things slowly is not my thing"

1676
01:57:37,332 --> 01:57:41,306
"Come to me like a crashing wave"

1677
01:57:41,899 --> 01:57:46,450
"I'll welcome the eagerness in you"

1678
01:57:46,530 --> 01:57:50,959
"Take me on a pleasure ride"

1679
01:57:51,039 --> 01:57:55,512
"Hey! Hey, Mister! Bite me hotly"

1680
01:57:55,592 --> 01:58:00,107
"Hey! Hey, Mister! Kill me sweetly"

1681
01:58:00,187 --> 01:58:09,457
(Music)

1682
01:58:10,494 --> 01:58:11,046
Buddy, what happened?

1683
01:58:11,126 --> 01:58:12,192
We have to leave this place immediately.

1684
01:58:12,365 --> 01:58:13,976
I'll explain everything later. Let's go.

1685
01:58:16,941 --> 01:58:19,384
Oh no! What are the 
police and government doing?

1686
01:58:19,579 --> 01:58:21,655
He can't do this without their support.

1687
01:58:22,152 --> 01:58:26,260
He's planning to use this 
bio-chemical weapon in 4 days.

1688
01:58:27,266 --> 01:58:29,482
It is useless to tell 
the police about it.

1689
01:58:29,562 --> 01:58:31,752
It might spook him off 
and he will be extra careful.

1690
01:58:32,649 --> 01:58:35,449
I wanted to exact revenge 
for killing my parents.

1691
01:58:35,947 --> 01:58:39,647
But he's planning to 
kill many more parents.

1692
01:58:40,825 --> 01:58:43,074
Others might spare his life, I won't.

1693
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:46,306
We need support to stop his barbarism.

1694
01:58:46,923 --> 01:58:48,951
Subbu gave us some cards that day, 
didn't he?

1695
01:58:50,378 --> 01:58:52,216
Here you go, 
there's a bank manager's visiting card.

1696
01:58:52,296 --> 01:58:53,470
He'll definitely help us if we meet him.

1697
01:58:53,550 --> 01:58:56,356
Okay. I'll go to the 
bank and meet the manager..

1698
01:58:56,436 --> 01:58:58,021
..to see if he can help us.

1699
01:58:58,302 --> 01:58:59,405
You both be careful.

1700
01:59:05,643 --> 01:59:06,238
Hello!

1701
01:59:06,318 --> 01:59:08,194
Vikranth just entered 
Everest Bank in Madhapur.

1702
01:59:08,811 --> 01:59:09,297
What?

1703
01:59:09,578 --> 01:59:10,691
He's Everest Bank, sir.

1704
01:59:10,771 --> 01:59:14,334
I'm starting immediately. 
Ask that area's CI to join me.

1705
01:59:30,773 --> 01:59:32,016
Do you remember what I told you?

1706
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:32,794
Yes, boss.

1707
01:59:32,874 --> 01:59:33,929
What will you say after going inside?

1708
01:59:34,009 --> 01:59:34,643
Hats off!

1709
01:59:35,367 --> 01:59:37,843
Not hats off! Say hands up!

1710
01:59:38,156 --> 01:59:40,178
Got it, boss! We should go in, 
switch off the CCTV camera..

1711
01:59:40,258 --> 01:59:42,508
..and catch that youth. 
Then you'll come in, right?

1712
01:59:42,588 --> 01:59:43,762
Exactly.

1713
01:59:43,842 --> 01:59:46,320
If you do it correctly, you'll be well 
settled in your life. (Snaps finger)

1714
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:47,729
Go ahead. 
- Okay, boss.

1715
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:06,446
Come here. 
- Yes, boss?

1716
02:00:07,030 --> 02:00:08,478
Why are you standing in the line?

1717
02:00:08,558 --> 02:00:10,521
Do you think we are 
here to do a fixed deposit?

1718
02:00:10,601 --> 02:00:12,435
No, boss. That youth 
is in the bank manager's room.

1719
02:00:12,658 --> 02:00:14,161
We thought we'll apply 
for a credit card..

1720
02:00:14,241 --> 02:00:15,728
..instead of wasting 
time until he comes out.

1721
02:00:18,388 --> 02:00:20,107
Since the CCTV cameras are too high..

1722
02:00:20,187 --> 02:00:21,501
..we couldn't cut the wires. 
- (Slaps)

1723
02:00:22,049 --> 02:00:22,881
Hands up!

1724
02:00:25,670 --> 02:00:27,324
All of you lie down on the floor!

1725
02:00:31,054 --> 02:00:32,254
Why are you lying down?

1726
02:00:32,334 --> 02:00:33,944
You asked everyone to 
lie down on the floor, boss.

1727
02:00:34,024 --> 02:00:37,609
I didn't mean you. 
Not the ones with the masks.

1728
02:00:37,782 --> 02:00:38,874
Oh, not us.

1729
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:42,777
Why did you stand?

1730
02:00:42,971 --> 02:00:45,680
You said not the ones with the masks.

1731
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:49,421
I meant everyone except 
the ones with guns.

1732
02:00:52,145 --> 02:00:53,399
Why did you stand?

1733
02:00:53,479 --> 02:00:56,507
You said everyone except 
the ones with guns.

1734
02:00:56,724 --> 02:00:58,291
I have a gun.

1735
02:01:00,053 --> 02:01:01,902
Why do you need a gun at this age?

1736
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:04,432
I didn't mean everyone with guns.

1737
02:01:04,704 --> 02:01:07,082
I meant the thieves that rob the bank.

1738
02:01:10,239 --> 02:01:13,590
I beg of you. 
Why are you torturing me this way?

1739
02:01:15,518 --> 02:01:16,729
(Gunshot)

1740
02:01:17,064 --> 02:01:17,939
Who are you?

1741
02:01:19,474 --> 02:01:24,253
Li. Bali. Kabali.

1742
02:01:24,631 --> 02:01:25,333
(Slaps)

1743
02:01:26,889 --> 02:01:27,570
Sir!

1744
02:01:28,478 --> 02:01:29,753
Sir, he's inside.

1745
02:01:30,110 --> 02:01:30,899
Move aside!

1746
02:01:32,305 --> 02:01:33,645
Boss, he slapped you.

1747
02:01:33,725 --> 02:01:34,640
Hold this.

1748
02:01:35,004 --> 02:01:35,674
(Slaps)

1749
02:01:36,318 --> 02:01:39,648
He didn't slap me. 
He just swatted a fly.

1750
02:01:41,994 --> 02:01:43,756
There's too much competition here.

1751
02:01:49,028 --> 02:01:50,044
(Door knocks)

1752
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:51,179
Sir!

1753
02:01:51,374 --> 02:01:51,839
No, no.

1754
02:01:51,919 --> 02:01:52,661
(Door knocks)

1755
02:01:52,741 --> 02:01:55,452
Vikranth, come out. We are not a threat.

1756
02:01:55,532 --> 02:01:56,922
We know everything that happened.

1757
02:01:57,002 --> 02:01:59,192
In fact, we are here to save you.

1758
02:01:59,419 --> 02:02:01,322
Vikranth, listen to me. Come out.

1759
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:03,938
We are not your foes. 
We are your friends.

1760
02:02:04,252 --> 02:02:05,041
Please trust me.

1761
02:02:05,247 --> 02:02:06,057
How can I trust you?

1762
02:02:06,137 --> 02:02:08,317
Do you think we can't 
catch you if we want?

1763
02:02:08,717 --> 02:02:11,625
I have to discuss something with you. 
Please come out.

1764
02:02:29,171 --> 02:02:30,144
Tell me.

1765
02:02:30,224 --> 02:02:32,512
What do you want from me? 
Why are you after me?

1766
02:02:35,333 --> 02:02:36,501
Who saved you that day?

1767
02:02:36,892 --> 02:02:37,811
Where were you all these days?

1768
02:02:37,891 --> 02:02:39,789
What did you do? What are your plans?

1769
02:02:40,038 --> 02:02:41,195
I won't ask you any of those questions.

1770
02:02:41,995 --> 02:02:43,908
But your life is in danger now.

1771
02:02:46,654 --> 02:02:48,316
You need our security.

1772
02:02:48,396 --> 02:02:49,538
Your security?

1773
02:02:49,808 --> 02:02:52,694
Where was your security 
when my parents were killed?

1774
02:02:52,774 --> 02:02:55,808
I know how to protect myself. 
Let me go. I've to go.

1775
02:02:56,046 --> 02:02:57,397
You can't go.

1776
02:02:58,420 --> 02:03:00,711
Forget about any revenge 
dramas you have in mind.

1777
02:03:00,982 --> 02:03:02,603
Sir, a call for you.

1778
02:03:03,803 --> 02:03:04,679
Tell me, Vittal.

1779
02:03:04,759 --> 02:03:05,965
You were right, sir.

1780
02:03:09,153 --> 02:03:10,288
My God!

1781
02:03:11,477 --> 02:03:12,710
Okay.

1782
02:03:14,137 --> 02:03:17,185
Where is he? I want him.

1783
02:03:17,650 --> 02:03:18,807
Where is he?

1784
02:03:18,887 --> 02:03:21,189
Look! I won't say this again.

1785
02:03:21,492 --> 02:03:23,049
Law has its own procedures.

1786
02:03:23,129 --> 02:03:27,957
Sir! You just enforce the law, 
we make the law.

1787
02:03:28,037 --> 02:03:30,733
We are rule makers 
and rule breakers too.

1788
02:03:30,928 --> 02:03:32,863
I want him for ten minutes.

1789
02:03:33,479 --> 02:03:35,133
You need to leave in five minutes.

1790
02:03:35,658 --> 02:03:37,280
(Phone rings)

1791
02:03:37,474 --> 02:03:39,847
That's for you. Without a doubt 
it is for you. - (Phone rings)

1792
02:03:40,112 --> 02:03:42,047
(Phone rings)

1793
02:03:43,442 --> 02:03:45,798
Hello! Good afternoon, sir.

1794
02:03:49,041 --> 02:03:49,798
Okay, sir.

1795
02:03:54,463 --> 02:03:55,642
Ten minutes only.

1796
02:03:56,128 --> 02:03:57,231
Love you, my boy.

1797
02:04:02,290 --> 02:04:03,544
I didn't kill your brother.

1798
02:04:03,717 --> 02:04:04,496
I know.

1799
02:04:05,418 --> 02:04:06,866
I know that the ones 
who killed my brother..

1800
02:04:06,946 --> 02:04:08,715
..killed your parents too.

1801
02:04:09,656 --> 02:04:14,283
I also know that even if I spare them, 
you won't.

1802
02:04:14,683 --> 02:04:15,969
Kill those rascals.

1803
02:04:17,714 --> 02:04:20,417
I will give you any help you want.

1804
02:04:22,644 --> 02:04:23,984
Any help?

1805
02:04:24,064 --> 02:04:25,379
Hundred percent.

1806
02:04:32,262 --> 02:04:34,056
(Gun cocks)

1807
02:04:36,002 --> 02:04:40,841
Just let me go. 
Otherwise I'll kill this MLA.

1808
02:04:41,879 --> 02:04:46,755
You fools! Throw your guns! 
Otherwise he'll kill me!

1809
02:04:47,133 --> 02:04:50,442
Vikranth, don't be foolish. 
I'm saying this for your welfare.

1810
02:04:50,522 --> 02:04:52,150
I don't care about my welfare.

1811
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:53,956
Don't you care about your father too?

1812
02:04:54,036 --> 02:04:57,394
I mean, Vikram Simha. 
Your father is not dead, he's alive.

1813
02:04:58,892 --> 02:05:00,135
I know that you won't believe me.

1814
02:05:00,215 --> 02:05:02,578
Two years before Vikram 
Simha died in an accident..

1815
02:05:03,032 --> 02:05:04,600
..he got injured in a shooting.

1816
02:05:05,194 --> 02:05:08,081
Our records say that there 
is a steel rod in his right leg.

1817
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:10,809
But the post-mortem report of his body..

1818
02:05:10,993 --> 02:05:12,107
..has no evidence of that rod.

1819
02:05:12,539 --> 02:05:14,139
Further investigation 
revealed the whole story.

1820
02:05:14,550 --> 02:05:17,091
Vikram Simha's college education..

1821
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:18,507
..and police training 
took place in Kerala.

1822
02:05:18,587 --> 02:05:21,802
I sent my men there 
for an investigation.

1823
02:05:21,975 --> 02:05:23,272
My suspicions were right.

1824
02:05:23,352 --> 02:05:25,445
My men found out that your 
father has been living there..

1825
02:05:25,525 --> 02:05:27,921
..in a farmhouse all these years.

1826
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:36,800
He might've escaped 
before my men reached there.

1827
02:05:36,984 --> 02:05:39,114
You can say these fairytales 
to little children.

1828
02:05:39,719 --> 02:05:40,768
They will laugh and clap for you.

1829
02:05:41,427 --> 02:05:42,281
Hey, move!

1830
02:05:42,361 --> 02:05:43,946
Move! Move!

1831
02:05:44,843 --> 02:05:45,848
Vikranth!

1832
02:05:46,378 --> 02:05:47,492
Vikranth! 
- Hey! Hey!

1833
02:05:47,572 --> 02:05:48,378
No!

1834
02:05:58,651 --> 02:05:59,614
Who do you want?

1835
02:06:00,641 --> 02:06:01,819
Hey!

1836
02:06:02,062 --> 02:06:02,872
(Gunshot)

1837
02:06:18,963 --> 02:06:21,892
(Phone rings)

1838
02:06:22,065 --> 02:06:22,631
Hello!

1839
02:06:22,711 --> 02:06:23,766
Vicky! 
- Yes?

1840
02:06:23,939 --> 02:06:24,717
Where are you?

1841
02:06:24,797 --> 02:06:27,420
Almost reaching home. 
What happened? Are you okay?

1842
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:30,544
Somebody shot me and took Anagha.

1843
02:06:30,624 --> 02:06:32,858
What? Oh my God! I'm coming there.

1844
02:06:32,938 --> 02:06:36,893
I'm fine. 
Don't worry about me. But Anagha..

1845
02:06:38,893 --> 02:06:41,380
Hey, I saw Anagha. Take care. 
- (Horn blares)

1846
02:07:00,159 --> 02:07:02,386
Call out to him now. Where is he?

1847
02:07:02,592 --> 02:07:04,538
You'll die if he comes here.

1848
02:07:04,708 --> 02:07:06,448
(Laughs)

1849
02:07:07,551 --> 02:07:11,194
His father will have 
to come down to kill me.

1850
02:08:46,648 --> 02:08:47,686
You are..

1851
02:09:06,227 --> 02:09:08,216
Anagha! Are you okay?

1852
02:09:08,551 --> 02:09:10,194
Yeah. 
- Nothing happened to you, right?

1853
02:09:10,769 --> 02:09:11,936
Let's go. Come on.

1854
02:09:12,016 --> 02:09:14,401
Vikranth, wait a minute.

1855
02:09:15,612 --> 02:09:16,834
He saved me.

1856
02:09:20,466 --> 02:09:21,893
But do you know who he is?

1857
02:09:22,213 --> 02:09:23,240
Huh?

1858
02:09:23,996 --> 02:09:26,699
Your father, Vikram Simha.

1859
02:09:29,315 --> 02:09:31,553
Anyone can become a 
father by giving birth..

1860
02:09:32,004 --> 02:09:34,306
..but not everyone deserves 
to be called a Dad.

1861
02:09:36,814 --> 02:09:39,333
My Dad is dead. 
Let's go.

1862
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:47,180
I thought you were a smart man.

1863
02:09:47,753 --> 02:09:51,408
But now I realized 
that you think like a fool.

1864
02:09:51,743 --> 02:09:52,553
What should I know about him?

1865
02:09:52,633 --> 02:09:55,916
That he washed his hands 
off of me before I could speak?

1866
02:09:56,899 --> 02:09:59,148
That he fooled the world 
into thinking that he is dead..

1867
02:09:59,743 --> 02:10:02,240
..and hid somewhere 
to save his own life?

1868
02:10:02,456 --> 02:10:03,332
Stop it, Vikranth!

1869
02:10:03,620 --> 02:10:04,928
Just stop it, for God's sake!

1870
02:10:06,052 --> 02:10:09,144
He is the greatest father in this world.

1871
02:10:09,436 --> 02:10:11,609
What did you say? 
He washed his hands off of you?

1872
02:10:12,485 --> 02:10:16,230
He sacrificed his whole 
life to save your life.

1873
02:10:16,457 --> 02:10:18,608
He knew that those rascals 
will hurt you if they find you..

1874
02:10:18,792 --> 02:10:23,894
..so he stayed far away 
from you all these years.

1875
02:10:23,974 --> 02:10:27,360
Even though he couldn't 
see his son growing up..

1876
02:10:27,933 --> 02:10:31,943
..he was with you in spirit 
and gave you a wonderful life.

1877
02:10:33,241 --> 02:10:35,381
He knows your every move.

1878
02:10:41,306 --> 02:10:43,544
He was behind every step you took.

1879
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:47,411
You are the son of a normal 
PET working in a college.

1880
02:10:48,147 --> 02:10:50,460
Did you ever think about 
how you have this lifestyle..

1881
02:10:50,795 --> 02:10:52,168
..where you can buy anything you want?

1882
02:10:52,774 --> 02:10:54,071
It is because of him.

1883
02:10:54,438 --> 02:10:56,579
Every son sees his father as a hero.

1884
02:10:57,344 --> 02:11:00,187
But you view him as a villain.

1885
02:11:02,414 --> 02:11:05,884
What can any father give his son?

1886
02:11:06,197 --> 02:11:08,468
Only confidence in his future.

1887
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:11,687
In order to give 
you that bright future..

1888
02:11:12,433 --> 02:11:14,531
..he burnt himself like a candle.

1889
02:11:24,386 --> 02:11:25,348
Dad!

1890
02:11:29,208 --> 02:11:32,311
I may not have raised 
you from childhood.

1891
02:11:32,668 --> 02:11:36,462
I may not have been 
a friend to give you advice.

1892
02:11:36,776 --> 02:11:41,857
But I've protected you 
every minute like a bodyguard.

1893
02:11:41,937 --> 02:11:44,755
Forgive me, Dad. I was very wrong.

1894
02:11:46,182 --> 02:11:49,792
I didn't realize that 
I've such an amazing father.

1895
02:11:50,441 --> 02:11:53,208
You sacrificed your whole life for me.

1896
02:11:54,127 --> 02:11:55,976
If I had known this..

1897
02:11:56,056 --> 02:11:59,348
Whatever I did for you as a father, 
it was my duty.

1898
02:11:59,727 --> 02:12:03,517
But whatever you do as my son, 
it is my blessing.

1899
02:12:03,766 --> 02:12:07,128
Live as you want. Do what you want to.

1900
02:12:07,387 --> 02:12:12,555
But before you take a step in your life, 
think it through.

1901
02:12:12,832 --> 02:12:14,778
I'll take care of this mess. You leave.

1902
02:12:14,858 --> 02:12:17,578
Then you also think it 
through before taking a step.

1903
02:12:18,453 --> 02:12:22,410
Because I'll be following 
your footsteps from now on.

1904
02:12:31,792 --> 02:12:35,202
I'll make Jehangir 
pay for separating us.

1905
02:12:35,797 --> 02:12:38,380
I saw him, Dad. He is in Hyderabad.

1906
02:12:38,553 --> 02:12:39,483
Really?

1907
02:12:39,563 --> 02:12:44,106
Tell me where he is. 
I can't sleep until I kill him.

1908
02:12:44,398 --> 02:12:47,966
No, Dad. It is not 
just about our revenge now.

1909
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:49,641
He has joined hands with terrorists..

1910
02:12:49,998 --> 02:12:52,982
..and is planning to kill 
millions of families like us.

1911
02:12:54,042 --> 02:12:56,842
He is making a dangerous 
biological weapon.

1912
02:12:57,469 --> 02:12:58,928
We have just two days time.

1913
02:12:59,123 --> 02:13:00,561
We have to stop it.

1914
02:13:01,802 --> 02:13:04,169
He's in the palace that 
is in the city outskirts.

1915
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:06,667
He'll be half-dead 
if we ruin that place.

1916
02:13:06,747 --> 02:13:09,672
I've a weapon that can stop him.

1917
02:13:14,185 --> 02:13:16,098
Are you wondering how 
he is related to Jehangir?

1918
02:13:16,509 --> 02:13:17,569
He's Jehangir's son.

1919
02:13:19,277 --> 02:13:20,239
(Gunshot)

1920
02:13:23,275 --> 02:13:24,788
(Explosion)

1921
02:13:31,553 --> 02:13:32,667
My God!

1922
02:13:33,899 --> 02:13:35,813
You had him all these years?

1923
02:13:35,893 --> 02:13:40,171
I expected that Jehangir 
will find you one day.

1924
02:13:40,409 --> 02:13:43,760
If he dares to touch you, 
this fellow will lose his life.

1925
02:13:45,251 --> 02:13:47,943
I have another idea. 
But first let's go from here.

1926
02:13:48,023 --> 02:13:48,927
Come.

1927
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:07,388
A sample of the dangerous 
virus you asked for.

1928
02:14:07,797 --> 02:14:10,273
Now India will become a mass grave.

1929
02:14:34,606 --> 02:14:36,061
(Ambulance siren wails)

1930
02:14:59,301 --> 02:15:00,134
Is it?

1931
02:15:00,425 --> 02:15:01,431
We need your support, sir.

1932
02:15:01,885 --> 02:15:03,334
All permissions are granted.

1933
02:15:03,571 --> 02:15:04,436
Thank you, sir.

1934
02:15:04,717 --> 02:15:07,723
Don't worry about protocols. 
Just go and get him.

1935
02:15:25,270 --> 02:15:26,124
(Gunshot)

1936
02:15:29,630 --> 02:15:30,495
(Gunshot)

1937
02:15:33,824 --> 02:15:34,862
(Gunshot)

1938
02:15:35,457 --> 02:15:36,667
(Gunshot)

1939
02:15:37,067 --> 02:15:37,932
(Gunshot)

1940
02:15:41,730 --> 02:15:42,476
(Gunshot)

1941
02:15:43,676 --> 02:15:47,136
(Gunshot)

1942
02:15:54,482 --> 02:15:55,423
(Gunshot)

1943
02:15:56,147 --> 02:15:58,125
(Gunshot)

1944
02:15:58,698 --> 02:16:00,677
(Gunshot)

1945
02:16:01,107 --> 02:16:05,269
(Gunshot)

1946
02:17:00,228 --> 02:17:03,731
Vikranth! Enemy of Jehangir Kazgar.

1947
02:17:06,930 --> 02:17:08,660
Count your last minutes.

1948
02:17:10,057 --> 02:17:12,122
(Snaps finger)

1949
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:19,117
(Gunshot)

1950
02:17:19,430 --> 02:17:20,273
(Gunshot)

1951
02:17:20,932 --> 02:17:22,240
(Gunshot)

1952
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:23,851
(Bottle shatters)

1953
02:17:53,619 --> 02:18:12,782
(Machine beeps)

1954
02:18:18,679 --> 02:18:19,716
You?

1955
02:19:07,783 --> 02:19:12,507
(Machine beeps)

1956
02:19:23,053 --> 02:19:26,977
(Police siren wails)

1957
02:19:32,325 --> 02:19:33,482
Let's move.

1958
02:20:44,795 --> 02:20:47,347
You leave now. I'll take care of it.

1959
02:20:47,714 --> 02:20:51,412
Thank you, sir. 
At least now you understand me.

1960
02:20:52,069 --> 02:20:52,675
It's okay.

1961
02:20:52,755 --> 02:20:54,005
The man that terrorized the country..

1962
02:20:54,815 --> 02:20:56,545
..Jehangir Kazgar is dead.

1963
02:20:56,848 --> 02:21:02,920
He was killed by our police 
in a secret operation yesterday.

1964
02:21:03,191 --> 02:21:05,331
He created a dangerous 
and life-threatening virus.

1965
02:21:05,936 --> 02:21:08,315
We stopped it before it 
could spread to the whole nation.

1966
02:21:08,509 --> 02:21:10,099
We arrested all his followers.

1967
02:21:11,051 --> 02:21:13,300
Now all the citizens can be in peace.

1968
02:21:13,990 --> 02:21:16,639
The story of a ruthless 
beast ended today.

1969
02:21:18,531 --> 02:21:20,055
I'm Pravin Prakash. 
- Hello, sir!

1970
02:21:20,290 --> 02:21:22,053
Is Jehangir's post-mortem report ready?

1971
02:21:22,355 --> 02:21:23,188
It is ready, sir.

1972
02:21:45,863 --> 02:21:46,804
Pen.

1973
02:22:08,477 --> 02:22:11,364
Look your son last time.

1974
02:22:19,754 --> 02:22:21,988
(Laughs) 
- (Car engine starts)

1975
02:22:22,770 --> 02:22:23,786
Brilliant.

1976
02:22:23,866 --> 02:22:25,270
(Explosion)

1977
02:22:47,839 --> 02:22:51,480
I'll put you behind the bars  
and make you eat jail food.

1978
02:22:51,560 --> 02:22:53,826
Otherwise I won't be called  
Vikram Simha Uggiraala.

1979
02:23:35,637 --> 02:23:36,675
"Come on!"

1980
02:23:45,311 --> 02:23:49,517
"Oh no! He's calling me"

1981
02:23:52,165 --> 02:23:56,330
"Naughty man! Naughty man!"

1982
02:23:56,773 --> 02:24:00,827
"Oh no! I don't know what to do"

1983
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:07,917
"Naughty man! Naughty man!"

1984
02:24:08,209 --> 02:24:12,652
"He doesn't leave when I ask him to"

1985
02:24:12,732 --> 02:24:16,974
"He is filled with mischievous thoughts"

1986
02:24:17,054 --> 02:24:21,806
"He says he likes my smile"

1987
02:24:21,886 --> 02:24:26,125
"But he doesn't care 
about my good qualities"

1988
02:24:26,525 --> 02:24:30,871
"Hey! Hey, Mister! Hug me tightly"

1989
02:24:30,951 --> 02:24:35,865
"Hey! Hey, Mister! Kill me sweetly"

1990
02:25:12,146 --> 02:25:14,265
"Why do you look at me like that?"

1991
02:25:14,345 --> 02:25:16,395
"Will you come to me?"

1992
02:25:16,475 --> 02:25:18,253
"Why are you running in a hurry?"

1993
02:25:18,333 --> 02:25:20,934
"Will you shut the doors?"

1994
02:25:21,014 --> 02:25:25,540
"Ready the love car, let's speed it up"

1995
02:25:25,620 --> 02:25:30,410
"Show me you strength, 
be naughty with me"

1996
02:25:30,490 --> 02:25:34,907
"Let's feed each other with kisses"

1997
02:25:34,987 --> 02:25:39,264
"Let's satisfy our raging 
lust with this sweetness"

1998
02:25:39,643 --> 02:25:44,010
"Let's feed each other with kisses"

1999
02:25:44,090 --> 02:25:47,999
"Let's satisfy our raging 
lust with this sweetness"

2000
02:25:48,799 --> 02:25:53,183
"Hey! Hey, Mister! Hug me tightly"

2001
02:25:53,263 --> 02:25:57,788
"Hey! Hey, Mister! 
Tackle with me sweetly"
