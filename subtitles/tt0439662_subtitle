00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,952
Our India is the best...

3
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,459
of all the world by far

4
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:51,626
Our India is the best...

5
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:56,135
...of all the world by far

6
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,309
We are it's buds.

7
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,977
It is our garden, all ours, ours.

8
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,985
Our India is the best...

9
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,990
...of all the world by far

10
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:12,988
This way.

11
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,331
Our tomorrow is based on our today

12
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,836
What we choose to do today will decide...

13
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,240
...what happens to us tomorrow.

14
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,671
The choice isn't between good and evil.

15
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,014
That's easy.

16
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,679
The real choices of life
are choosing between...

17
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:44,687
...the lesser of two evils,
or the greater of two goods.

18
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,622
Now what do you choose,
Zooni, what's your choice?

19
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,928
Oh, leave my little girl alone!

20
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,459
Just listen to your heart dear...

21
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,033
...not your father's philosophy!

22
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,631
Try and take some decisions...

23
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,704
...from the heart rather than the brain, Zulfi

24
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:07,535
If I'd used my brain you wouldn't be here,
Nafisa my love.

25
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,479
So? Zooni?

26
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,285
Papa, Mama, I really can't decide.

27
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,551
I'll do whatever you say.

28
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,954
So that's it. It's decided.

29
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,062
Zooni will not go to Delhi.

30
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:36,064
I found my prince.
When will Zooni find hers?

31
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,974
When will some footballer
hit her head with a ball?

32
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:42,738
Any regrets?

33
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,143
Regrets?

34
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:50,848
I praise God every day that the
great Zulfikar Ali Beg's...

35
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,321
...penalty kick missed the goal...

36
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,092
...and hit me, square on the head.

37
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,922
It was my worst kick ever!

38
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,188
Any regrets?

39
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,428
Regrets?

40
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,266
That's why I tended to you
in the hospital for a week.

41
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,274
We must accept that Zooni...

42
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,707
...may have to live her life without
that special someone.

43
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,779
That perhaps she will never marry.

44
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:24,083
And when we're gone
who will look out for her?

45
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,951
We must give her the
chance to live her life.

46
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,794
We need to support her independence.

47
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,596
Be her strength, not her weakness.

48
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,051
Madam Mehbooba

49
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,154
Bobo, the name is Bobo not Mehbooba

50
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,828
Whatever you command your highness.

51
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,657
By the way, your bags weigh
more than your brain!

52
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,660
Obviously! Haven't you heard that saying?

53
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,393
Which one?
- "The buffalo is bigger than the brain."

54
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,831
No dummy, it's "Is the brain bigger
or the buffalo?"

55
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,008
Fatty! - Not Fatty, Fatima.

56
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,609
Don't know why you girls insist on
distorting perfectly good names.

57
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,746
Yes, Ruby. - Not Ruby, Rubina.

58
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,082
Come on... take the bags at least!

59
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,016
We have to represent Kashmir,
at a Republic Day performance...

60
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,525
...at the President's Palace,
in front of the Chief Minister of Delhi...

61
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,856
...and what do I have to pull this off?

62
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,193
A bunch of wild cats!

63
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,770
If we're a bunch of wild cats
what does that make our leader?

64
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,036
Who said that?

65
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,039
You've carried your knitting?

66
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,646
When we're upset,
we say things to distract

67
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:56,712
"Have you taken your knitting?

68
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,144
Kept your ticket safely?

69
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,878
Don't get off at a station on the way."

70
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,383
God keep you safe.

71
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:08,993
Papa... papa! When papa's upset,
not just his voice

72
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,560
His walk also changes.

73
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:15,063
Yes, and he can't even cry in front of all these girls.

74
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,471
But I have no such problem!

75
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:27,577
I know you have to do this...

76
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,239
...but I don't know why, I'm afraid.

77
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,475
Afraid of what?

78
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,582
Loosing me to some prince?

79
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,253
Oh, I wish!

80
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,923
One look at you,
and he'll be on his knees

81
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,421
Heaven forbid! Will he be a porter?

82
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,149
Kneel to get my bags? - Hush!

83
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,919
Not a porter, not your bags,
he'll take your heart away.

84
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,499
With some poetry maybe...

85
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,768
..."Every once in a while
I get this feeling in my heart...

86
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,334
...that you were made for me, all apart."

87
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,269
"You were living in the
mountains somewhere...

88
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,773
...before there was me."

89
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:02,446
"You have been called down
to this earth, only for me."

90
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,451
God keep you safe, my child,
God keep you safe!

91
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,624
God keep you, mama.

92
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,289
Have a safe journey.

93
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,798
Be sure to say a prayer for me
at the Jama Masjid. - Yes, mama.

94
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,466
Take Zooni for an eye test in the big city...

95
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,396
...and you, Rubina take care of my baby!

96
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,797
Relax Aunty.

97
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,631
Don't worry, I'm here aren't I?

98
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,306
That's what I'm afraid of Fatima.

99
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,634
It's Fatty, aunty.

100
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,971
Bye dear, Bye Zooni!

101
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,048
Mama! Mama!

102
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:39,818
Yes, my child!

103
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,982
If the Prince recites poetry
what should I say?

104
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,493
"May my life's breath find refuge in your heart...

105
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,326
...destroyed in your love may my life depart."

106
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,999
Bye Mama!

107
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,693
Why do you do this?

108
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,130
You can say something as well.

109
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,529
Now listen up Rao.
We're here for just 7 days.

110
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,034
5 days to the show, and 2 for holidaying.

111
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,198
I want to sight- see Delhi,
not your bald head.

112
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,274
Stand straight like a man!

113
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,704
I'm not even a man any more Madam.

114
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,142
After years of bowing to
government officers...

115
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,713
...I have come to this sorry state.

116
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,544
Today if I have children,
even they will be born bent over.

117
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,279
I have no interest in your
family planning program!

118
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:51,478
Where is that tour guide?

119
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,127
I am the Balwaan.
Not the Cartoon Network.

120
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,827
You are exactly what you look like!

121
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,299
Now tell me what's the problem here?

122
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,571
Where do I start?

123
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:10,899
From the head light to the exhaust...

124
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,975
...there are problems and more problems.

125
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,347
I mean your tour guide.
Where on earth is he?

126
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:28,092
"Don't look around the city
Forget the wasteland too"

127
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:34,260
"Behold God's greatest creation.
Rehan is just above you."

128
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,107
You Mr. Romeo. Stop this cheap poetry!

129
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,886
You didn't applaud me, now at least help me

130
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,849
Oh, you're blind.

131
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,893
Yes, you didn't see that?
Are you blind too?

132
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,694
Thank God, I'm not.

133
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,970
That's a nice thing to say to a blind person.

134
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,003
If I was blind, I couldn't have seen...

135
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,640
...the most beautiful thing in the world, you.

136
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:27,210
"Your beauty made God make a mistake,
what more can I say?

137
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,014
So that you don't caste an evil eye on yourself,
he took your eyes away."

138
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,322
Zooni, where are you?

139
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,490
I'm coming Fatty.

140
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,561
Fatty? Is that your name or your dog's?

141
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,494
Come on Balwante...

142
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,498
...hit the gas!

143
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,196
Heavenly!

144
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,441
If wish I was a roll of wool...

145
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,047
If wish I was a roll of wool...

146
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,385
...wrapped around her fingers...

147
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,224
If you were a roll of wool,
with the needles... I'd...

148
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,385
I wish she'd make a sweater out of me,
wear me, even in the summer.

149
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,062
Wow! What a thought!

150
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,396
Zooni, stop encouraging his nonsense.

151
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,340
"I am not the flower jasmine,
I am the flower rose.

152
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,542
I am your lifelong admirer,
not of your friend sitting close."

153
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,349
Hey Mr. Guide, your cheap poetry
is going to get you nowhere.

154
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,751
So, who are you knitting this sweater for?

155
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,589
She's knitting it for a prince,
not for a devil like you.

156
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,096
And if she was interested in you...

157
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,426
...she would speak up not sit silent.

158
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,829
Oh, so she does speak?

159
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,335
I knew she was blind,
thought she was mute too

160
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,842
Zooni! Don't talk to him,
You don't know these men...

161
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,936
Looks like you know men very well.

162
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,844
Stupid guide

163
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:44,185
"If you sit there in silence, regret it you will.

164
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,782
So often after silence love
has awakened, stronger still."

165
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,138
"There is no limit to human desire..."

166
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,634
"There is no limit to human desire, no dearth.

167
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,807
After 2 yards of burial cloth,
we still want 2 yards of earth."

168
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:08,809
Superb!

169
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,641
Superb! Outstanding!

170
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,654
"I'll look pain square in the eye,
face every test laid out for me.

171
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:25,163
For the sake of your friendship,
dear friend, I'll even love my enemy."

172
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,168
Oh yeah, I love your style!

173
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,009
The emperor Shah Jahan once walked
these lanes of the Red Fort.

174
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:47,241
And so did Mumtaz,
his very, very beautiful wife. - Careful!

175
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,689
I can manage myself.

176
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,585
But how will I manage myself, around you.

177
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,527
Shall we?

178
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,865
Bobo, tell me, what does he look like?

179
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:12,373
Killer, girl, a real killer.

180
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,019
He's simply obnoxious!

181
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,554
He looks ok, so I thought
he must be a nice guy...

182
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,822
...but he called me a stupid girl... so...

183
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,395
And forget all his sweet talk...

184
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,896
...the way he looks at women, its shameful!

185
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,970
And he told me he doesn't believe in God,
can you imagine that?

186
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,732
Look even the crows are cawing.
It's a sign.

187
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,501
Stay away from that Rehan guide.

188
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,413
"How can you stay away from me and go?

189
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,912
How can your heart forget me so?

190
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,314
That fragrance on your breath is me.

191
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,349
How ever will you stop, not breathe?"

192
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,930
Great! Fabulous!

193
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,097
Come on, let's go.

194
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:06,923
Come.

195
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:07,153
If the moon was to recommend me.

196
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,328
This is what he'd say to you.

197
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,998
I want to drop the veil of decency.

198
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,169
I want to cross the line with you.

199
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,838
I insist on destroying myself.

200
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,671
On destroying myself in you.

201
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:30,676
If the moon was to recommend me.

202
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,852
This is what he'd say to you.

203
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,520
I want to drop the veil of decency.

204
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,022
I want to cross the line with you.

205
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:10,053
Your charms are like a gentle breeze.

206
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,053
Let them touch me as you pass.

207
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,790
Your every move a graceful branch.

208
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,999
Please move into my heart.

209
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,901
Come into my arms,
any excuse will do.

210
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,734
For I must, I must destroy myself in you.

211
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,742
If the moon was to recommend me.

212
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,915
This is what he'd say to you.

213
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,685
I want to drop the veil of decency.

214
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:45,414
I want to cross the line with you.

215
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,632
If I tell you my true intentions.

216
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,864
I'm sure they'll make you blush.

217
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,634
If I make you hear my heartbeats.

218
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,815
I'm sure they'll leave you flushed.

219
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,479
But I cannot hide my feelings true.

220
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,487
For I must, I must destroy myself in you.

221
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:56,422
If the moon was to recommend me.

222
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,654
This is what he'd say to you.

223
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,161
I want to drop the veil of decency.

224
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,505
I want to cross the line with you.

225
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,103
I insist on destroying myself.

226
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:17,180
On destroying myself in you.

227
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:41,866
Stand straight. Looking at you
I'm getting a backache.

228
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,042
And you Mr. Cartoon Network...

229
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,541
...we have to leave for rehearsal
at exactly 9 AM tomorrow.

230
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,541
So then leave.

231
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,045
It's me. Rehan.

232
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,048
I know. Only you can be so impudent.

233
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,729
I want to be even more impudent.

234
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,564
I want you to run away with me.

235
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,907
I want to show you Delhi.

236
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:26,240
Without your bodyguards,
don't say no, not without thinking at least

237
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,751
You'll anyway be thinking about me so...

238
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,420
God forbid, the crows are cawing.

239
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:46,929
I'll wait for you after the rehearsal tomorrow.
With these crows.

240
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:59,944
You have had more girls in your life
than there is mileage on my bus.

241
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,617
Why do you want this blind girl?

242
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,615
What can I do Balwante,
everyone wants the moon.

243
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,786
There's just one headlight in the sky,
that shows us the way.

244
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,465
Now you want that too?

245
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,469
"They say in love you always loose sleep.

246
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:25,799
I wish someone would love me,
I bloody sleep and sleep and sleep."

247
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,308
Let's go.

248
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,313
Zooni! You must be tired, go to sleep.

249
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,157
I am awake after so many years.

250
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:47,154
I can't sleep now. I can't sleep now.

251
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:57,670
I want to be even more impudent,
I want you to run away with me.

252
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,177
Why aren't you concentrating?

253
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,179
Can I use your phone?

254
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,180
Pick up, mama!

255
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,692
This is one decision you'll have
to take on your own Zooni.

256
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,028
Oh Lord, how silly of me.

257
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,701
Of course there's no point in your...

258
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,200
...going sightseeing when you can't see.

259
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,204
Okay. You can go back to the
hostel after rehearsal.

260
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,215
Fine! At least you'll be away from
that Rehan guide.

261
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:50,058
Brother, tell me something.
You stand here all day.

262
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,891
Don't you wish you were inside
on the President's chair?

263
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,563
Why should I think that?

264
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,234
In the police we regularly get promoted.

265
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,736
But once you're President,
there's no scope of promotion at all!

266
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,902
You're a very jolly man!

267
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,407
All thanks to my grandfather.

268
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,245
Grandfather?
- My grandfather worked for the British.

269
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,916
All day long he would hear them say
'Jolly Good' this and 'Jolly Good' that.

270
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,745
When I was born he was losing his memory.

271
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,921
All he remembered was 'Jolly Good'.

272
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,589
So that's what he named me. Jolly Good.

273
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,092
Yes, yes have a laugh at me.

274
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,760
Even the officers that pass by here say...

275
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,260
..."Jolly Good... Singh" laugh and move on.

276
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:27,759
I think that's great.

277
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,763
Thanks to you, the country
is run in good spirits!

278
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:43,277
"I felt God himself had blessed me.

279
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:48,609
When all she did was to address me."

280
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,960
Look, I sent Rana with Balwaan and the bus.

281
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,795
No, I'm not coming today.

282
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,964
So what if I didn't tell you earlier.
I'm telling you now.

283
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,309
Let's go.
- You left work without permission?

284
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:12,977
So?

285
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,310
My father says that if a person
can't be loyal to their work...

286
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,141
...they can't be trusted for anything.

287
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:25,145
I've left work for you and you're
giving me a speech on loyalty?

288
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,825
My mother says there is
nothing bigger than loyalty.

289
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,987
If you're done with your mother and
father's sermons can we go?

290
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,663
Why am I saying all this to you?

291
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,831
Why are you saying all this to me?

292
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,998
So that I go back to work?

293
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:38,999
Yes.

294
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:50,007
Think about it, if I go today
I won't come back tomorrow.

295
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,515
I'll go back to the guest house,
you'll go back to work.

296
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,347
Tomorrow you'll take the day off
and then we'll go, ok?

297
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:06,353
You've heard what your parents
have said. Now hear me.

298
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,202
If I go today I will not come back tomorrow.

299
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,368
You'll come. Let's go.

300
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:26,540
"I don't live the life of the selfless,
nor do I grab another's wine.

301
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,050
If she has love let her come and declare it...

302
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,555
...to ask her, to follow her, I decline."

303
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:36,890
God be with you.

304
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,414
Greetings Ms. Zooni.

305
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:57,907
Greetings Mr. Jolly

306
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:03,913
You know what happened yesterday?

307
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,090
Yesterday I said good morning to 20 people...

308
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,259
...and they all said good evening to me instead.

309
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,260
How can so many people be wrong?

310
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,930
It was my watch that was wrong.
It stopped in the morning...

311
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,599
...so I said 'good morning' to
people all day long!

312
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,595
I can't see Rehan today.

313
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,433
I can't see him either.

314
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:28,779
I think he's like me.
Completely clean at heart...

315
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,608
...and completely muddled in the head.

316
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,946
"I couldn't quench my thirst with water
so I set off for the bar.

317
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:40,282
I gave up complaining to God about you...

318
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,624
...for He is the most smitten by you, by far."

319
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,133
I'm with you now.

320
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,133
So, how are you going to
show Delhi to a blind girl?

321
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,302
Can you see me?

322
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,473
No.

323
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,154
What's my voice like?

324
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,826
Like the thunder before the storm.

325
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,165
What do I smell like?

326
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:30,664
Like the earth after the first rain.

327
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,343
What do I feel like?

328
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,522
Like a prince in a beggar's clothing

329
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,533
And just like this you will see Delhi.

330
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,870
Watch out! This is the Gateway of Blood.

331
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,711
The emperor Aurangzeb had his brother...

332
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,046
...Dara Shikoh beheaded,
and hung his head up here. - There.

333
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,051
Exactly where you are standing.

334
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,888
And the British government
killed two sons and...

335
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,891
...a grandson of Bahadur Shah Zafar,
right there, behind you.

336
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,225
Please. That's enough.
Let's leave from here.

337
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,233
This is the bloody history of Delhi.

338
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:39,242
The Mughals, the British,
a lot of bloodshed had happened here

339
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:44,078
That's why, till today, tears of
blood flow from these walls.

340
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,579
Scared? What did you think?

341
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,755
I wouldn't get back at you for yesterday?

342
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,087
And what did you think,
I'd get scared so easily?

343
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,087
When I have never seen any colors...

344
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,762
...how can the color of blood scare me?

345
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,121
Now you're scared.

346
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,140
I'm going. I'm going to Delhi,
to get her back.

347
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,138
It's been 4 days.
That's enough to understand life.

348
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,804
What'll be happening to her without us?
Just think?

349
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,989
She's brought up on home food,
she must be starving.

350
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:11,493
The Delhi crowds,
who will look out for her?

351
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,499
I'm not there.

352
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,682
I can't take her agony any more, I'm going.

353
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,852
Are you going for her sake or for your own?

354
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,225
You were right, Rehan.

355
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,394
You did show me Delhi.

356
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,413
They say, the feelings one
gets for the country...

357
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,913
...in front of the Eternal Soldier Flame...

358
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,746
...one gets for love in front of the Taj Mahal.

359
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,252
Feelings, love, that's all just talk.

360
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:49,089
When it comes down to basics
then needs are everything.

361
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,263
Needs of the stomach, needs of the body

362
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,939
So you believe needs are everything...

363
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,438
...and feelings are nothing? - Yes.

364
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,937
So all this time you're spending with me...

365
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,273
...is this also to fulfill some need?

366
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:14,116
You shouldn't tease a man like me.
My needs are great.

367
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,952
Even one chicken is not enough.

368
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,619
Even one girl is not enough.

369
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,810
So, Mr. Rehan, how are things with you?

370
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,810
And how are you Zeenat?

371
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,818
Forgotten how I am?

372
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,316
Come and meet me, I'll remind you.

373
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:52,989
It's my fault actually.
He's been busy with me.

374
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,992
That's what makes Rehan guide so special.

375
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,838
So, when do you plan on
being busy with me again?

376
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,011
"I can't explain the ways
of this market to you,

377
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:12,178
He who is sold, can't ever be a buyer anew."

378
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:20,021
You'll never improve. Ever.
Good evening.

379
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,032
You seem to know her very well.

380
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,041
That's me.

381
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:43,536
I told you I only believe in needs...

382
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,549
...not in feelings or love.

383
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,713
And I only believe in love.

384
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,394
Meeting that guide on the sly.

385
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:07,059
Forget Helen,
I can't believe you lied to me!

386
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,898
This is just why I lied to you.

387
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,904
You're less of a friend and more of a Hitler.

388
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,907
Hitler? I was just protecting you.

389
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,578
Not me. You were protecting
my blindness.

390
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,915
Zooni, how do I explain it to you?
He just isn't right for you.

391
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:30,083
Perhaps, but when I'm with him
I feel happy, feel alive.

392
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:34,428
And this feeling is special.
Very special.

393
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,765
But I don't like that Guide.
Not one bit.

394
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,937
And I don't care what you say.

395
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,936
I'll never let you go with him.
Never.

396
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,110
Turn off your light.

397
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,629
Jolly Singh! Could you please allow
my good luck to come in? Please?

398
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,124
Don't insist.
This tough Sikh has a soft heart.

399
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,131
I'm sorry but rules are rules and
rules are never Jolly Good.

400
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,128
It's ok. I know you're only doing your duty.

401
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,974
But still, I will be singing for him.

402
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,828
People say that after so many years
of Independence...

403
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,161
...our Republic Day has lost all meaning.

404
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,497
That it's just another holiday.

405
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,171
But it's not just a holiday for me.

406
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,337
This day marks the birth of my country.

407
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,511
They say that the state
of our country is like...

408
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,684
...that of our old monuments.

409
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,011
What's beautiful was only in the past.

410
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,855
I am blind so I don't see the
faults in my country...

411
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:12,184
...but why can't those who see,
see the beauty here?

412
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,692
What Emperor Shah Jahan had said
of my home state of Kashmir...

413
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:19,698
...we believe that's true for all of India.

414
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,363
If there is a heaven on earth...

415
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,703
...it is here, it is here, it is here.

416
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:04,404
The earth here changes color at every step.

417
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:08,915
The language here has all the colors best.

418
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,420
The earth here changes color at every step.

419
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:18,084
The language here has all the colors best.

420
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:22,756
The climes wear green on their head.

421
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:27,597
The sky lays a blue sheet over it's bed.

422
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,605
Golden river, Green ocean,
Every part so dressed.

423
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:36,109
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

424
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:40,614
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

425
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,944
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

426
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:50,283
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

427
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:08,302
Motherland, I bow to you.

428
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:17,318
The sun with its rose-tinted
neck plays around.

429
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:25,990
The yellow scarf of flowers
covers the shy ground.

430
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,497
Color in the veil, color on the mound,
bright, bright color all around.

431
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:35,000
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

432
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:40,333
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

433
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:07,361
Bright red faces all around,
smiling and glowing in fervor.

434
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:16,040
Colorful laughter, colorful happiness,
relationships full of color.

435
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,380
Color in promises, color in memories,
color, color, more color.

436
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:24,714
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

437
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:30,052
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

438
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:12,594
The color of love here runs so deep,
once its on it's there for keeps.

439
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:21,772
The color of true love so still
simply glistens does not spill.

440
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,938
Color in charm, color in manner,
all colors full of flavor.

441
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:30,617
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

442
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:35,118
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

443
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,786
The earth here changes color at every step.

444
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:44,297
The language here has all the colors best.

445
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:49,132
The climes wear green on their head.

446
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,470
The sky lays a blue sheet over it's bed.

447
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:57,811
Golden river, Green ocean,
Every part so dressed.

448
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,312
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

449
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,321
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

450
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:15,491
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

451
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:19,825
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

452
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:24,004
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

453
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:29,168
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

454
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,195
Go Zooni, he's waiting outside for you.

455
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,368
He said I am the cutest of all the girls.

456
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,371
After you of course, Zooni. Go.

457
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,371
Stop. You're not going anywhere.

458
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,045
Certainly not like this.

459
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,881
With your hair all over the place.

460
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,879
You haven't even worn your stole properly.

461
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,384
I can't let you go like this.

462
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,553
You're really...

463
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:14,724
Ok, Ok, that's enough of that.

464
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,722
Go now.

465
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,234
Let's go.

466
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:38,741
"The fire is in the sun,
but it's the earth that does the burning.

467
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,586
The eyes fall in love,
but it's the heart.

468
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,083
...that does the suffering."

469
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,590
You're looking exceptionally
beautiful this evening.

470
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,596
Really?

471
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:54,930
You're looking exactly the same to me.

472
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,441
You have brought me here? You?

473
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,447
I thought you don't believe in God.

474
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,620
Will you just keep quiet for a bit?

475
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,287
Shut your eyes now.

476
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,626
Rehan, my eyes are always shut.

477
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,471
Rest your eyelids

478
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,307
They say this blessed water does miracles.

479
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,155
I hope that's true.

480
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,489
No one has ever asked for
such a blessing for me.

481
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,169
I'm not asking for you,
I'm asking for myself.

482
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:12,501
Perhaps if your eyes are open
you'll keep your mouth shut!

483
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,017
It's so loud!

484
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:22,852
This is the real Delhi.

485
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,520
The quiet museums, Red Fort,
that's not the real Delhi.

486
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:29,020
This is the sound of Delhi.
The essence of Delhi

487
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,690
I wish I was deaf as well...

488
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,363
Just a minute. Wait here.

489
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,362
Yes, it's me.

490
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,368
Yes, yes, I got it alright.

491
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,699
Rehan, you're watching me, aren't you?

492
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,549
What's this madness?

493
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,380
I just wanted to show you.

494
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,553
Show what? That you're such a fool?

495
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,714
- I'll call you later.

496
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,057
Boys, and girls you know...

497
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:07,389
...they impress each other
on their first dates. So I too.

498
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,234
Your life is very precious Zooni...

499
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:18,067
...don't waste it on anyone.
Certainly not on me.

500
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,909
My mother says, to gain something
you have to loose something.

501
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,573
Oh God!

502
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,580
Mother says this, father says that...

503
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,753
...where is Zooni in all this?
What does Zooni say?

504
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,915
Nobody's ever asked Zooni

505
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,249
I'm asking you. Tell me.

506
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,092
I like you.

507
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:46,928
Let's go.

508
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,787
Now you're scared.

509
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:20,129
Our destiny has brought us
these precious moments today

510
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:31,813
Look at me up close,
imbibe me in every way

511
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,649
You're still scared.

512
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:44,159
Just in case your fate has
another card to play

513
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:52,496
Think we'll never meet again, just suppose,
not till this lifetime is forever closed

514
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,000
I'll manage from here.

515
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:08,511
Come in to my arms, hold me close,
we may never again have this night's repose

516
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:19,687
Think we'll never meet again, just suppose,
not till this lifetime is forever closed

517
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:31,035
Come in to my arms, hold me close,
we may never again have this night's repose

518
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:41,877
Think we'll never meet again, just suppose,
not till this lifetime is forever closed

519
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:45,381
Where is Rehan the gorgeous?

520
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,553
What's the time, Bobo?

521
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,051
Ten thirty

522
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:54,056
My watch is fine, why is he late?

523
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,058
It's our last day.

524
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:59,894
Maybe he's getting you a gift, so he's late.

525
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:01,896
He himself is a gift.

526
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:05,569
No news?

527
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:07,905
No.

528
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,754
No Fatty. Nothing yet.

529
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,092
Mama.

530
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,262
How are you my child?

531
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:30,591
We saw the performance on TV.

532
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,428
It was fantastic.

533
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,766
When everyone stood up to clap.
Your father and me...

534
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:40,603
I want to speak to you about something.

535
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,778
What is it? Tell me.

536
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,280
When papa and you first met.

537
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:49,448
After he tended to you in the hospital...

538
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:54,454
...if he had suddenly disappeared.
What would you have done?

539
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,957
I would have asked him why
he was misbehaving.

540
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:01,289
And told him to stop his
nonsense immediately.

541
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,126
Misbehaving? Who is misbehaving?

542
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,130
So is that what I should do?

543
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:07,635
Who is he?

544
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:08,463
Who is who?

545
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,804
So do you love him?

546
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,309
Do you love him? What are you saying?
Give me the phone.

547
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,142
Just a minute. - Give me the phone.
I'll deal with this.

548
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,150
So what have you decided?

549
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:29,648
Nothing. I don't think he loves me.

550
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,320
Just remember one thing dear...

551
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,999
...give your life for the one
who gives you his love...

552
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,498
...but give your self-respect only to...

553
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,830
...the one who is willing to be
destroyed for your love.

554
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,013
This is Humayun's tomb.

555
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,512
It was constructed for him
by his wife Hamida.

556
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,515
Take a look at what a wife
made for her husband.

557
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,517
And you can't even make me breakfast.

558
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:02,852
Don't worry, I'll start building
your tomb right away.

559
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,856
Come... - I am blind and you are the
one who can't see me...

560
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:12,194
"If by mistake I have made a mistake...

561
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,030
...then please consider it a
mistake and forget it.

562
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,204
But only forget the mistake...

563
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,873
...even by mistake don't ever forget me."

564
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,376
Heard that? Great!

565
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,208
Take them ahead.

566
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,386
Let's go. - But our guide?

567
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,724
Move it! Look here, the Qutub Minar.

568
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:50,905
No Zooni, Fatty was right.

569
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:57,572
You should love a prince,
not a devil like me.

570
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:05,414
It's too late now.
Now this devil is my prince.

571
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,587
I can't give you anything.

572
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:18,759
Remember I told you, I believe in needs,
not in feelings or love.

573
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:28,767
Women are like cities for me.
I spend some time in one.

574
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,777
I get to know it, get immersed in it and...

575
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,108
...and then move to another city.

576
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:39,520
This is me, and I can't change.

577
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:49,622
Look Rehan, all this stuff about princes
is good in dreams and stories.

578
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,461
In reality I have found you.

579
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,298
We haven't met by chance,
we've met by destiny.

580
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,633
If not the rest of our lives, we can spend...

581
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,311
...the next 12 hours together, can't we?

582
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:09,480
Perhaps that's all we have,
just today, just now.

583
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:21,163
Don't come close to me,
this storm will destroy you.

584
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,838
"May my life's breath find
refuge in your heart

585
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,507
May my life's breath find
refuge in your heart.

586
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,507
Destroyed in your love may my life depart."

587
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:52,526
How can you love me so much?
How can anyone love another so much?

588
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,203
I promise you this Zooni Ali Beg...

589
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:10,871
...the next 12 hours will be the
most beautiful of your life.

590
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,771
The raindrops have a conspiracy.

591
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,607
They have a silent wish, a plea.

592
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,613
The raindrops have a conspiracy.

593
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:24,445
They have a silent wish, a plea.

594
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:28,784
Look, just see.

595
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:35,294
Look, just see.

596
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,630
Softly, slowly this gentle breeze.

597
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,463
Says so much, listen please.

598
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:47,804
Why the distance between you and me.

599
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:52,638
Look, just see.

600
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:59,319
Look, just see.

601
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:36,352
Never again will the winds be this shameless.

602
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:42,354
Never again will our steps falter so blameless.

603
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:48,534
Never again will the winds be this shameless.

604
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:54,366
Never again will our steps falter so blameless.

605
00:56:55,745 --> 00:57:01,047
This rain is not so straight, it has a twist.

606
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:06,051
It's telling us something as it pours and mists.

607
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:11,226
Just understand it.

608
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:17,393
Just understand it.

609
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,068
Softly, slowly this gentle breeze.

610
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:23,238
Says so much, listen please.

611
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:29,405
Why the distance between you and me.

612
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:33,742
Look, just see.

613
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:41,254
Look, just see.

614
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:26,468
Desire, like a fire-fly, glows bright then dim.

615
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:32,297
It's such a sweet predicament that we're in.

616
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:37,973
Desire, like a fire-fly, glows bright then dim.

617
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:43,983
It's such a sweet predicament that we're in.

618
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:51,151
Don't discard the request
from our lips like this.

619
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:55,828
Don't call this wish of
our breathe remiss.

620
00:58:56,366 --> 00:59:00,826
Just touch, Feel this.

621
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:07,336
Just touch, Feel this.

622
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,172
Softly, slowly this gentle breeze.

623
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,345
Says so much, listen please.

624
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:18,852
Why the distance between you and me.

625
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:24,190
Look, just see.

626
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,863
Look, just see.

627
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:29,530
Look, just see.

628
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,365
Look, just see.

629
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:43,705
Look, just see.

630
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:13,041
Rehan! Wake up. Wake up.

631
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:16,939
My train is at 10.
If you don't wake up I'll miss it.

632
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:20,980
I spoke to Fatty and she's bringing
my things to the station.

633
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:25,182
We don't have to go to the guest house.
How much you sleep?

634
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:26,713
Wake up! Don't you have to
go to work as well?

635
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,821
And don't you dare miss work today

636
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,595
See I forgot, Mama had told me
to get the eye test done.

637
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,696
And Papa has asked for a chess set.

638
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:38,492
Can we stop and get one on the way?
Do we have time?

639
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,364
Rehan! Are you listening?

640
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:50,774
Oh, I didn't even say goodbye
to Jolly Good Singh.

641
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:58,611
You please tell him for me.
Here's my address...

642
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,749
Will you write to me?

643
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,551
Your wife's first visit home after marriage?

644
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:25,908
I want to say...

645
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:31,883
No, Rehan. You made no promises
and I will not ask you for anything.

646
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:38,487
I always wanted love to be the
most important thing in my life...

647
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:47,669
...and now, thanks to you, it is.
You were wrong Rehan.

648
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:53,003
I am not destroyed in your storm
I am rejuvenated.

649
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:04,850
Now your picture will
remain with me always.

650
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:14,254
And now I can't leave.

651
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,326
Not until you step off my stole.

652
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:38,546
God be with you Rehan, be happy.

653
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,134
Now can I say I told you so

654
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:29,596
No

655
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:34,840
I won't say it. I'll never say it.

656
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,942
"May my life's breath find
refuge in your heart."

657
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:49,350
"May my life's breath find
refuge in your heart."

658
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,859
"Destroyed in your love
may my life depart."

659
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:10,374
Fatty! If not for me at least
pull the chain for Zooni.

660
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:13,644
With pleasure.

661
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:20,915
What's going on?
What is the guide doing here?

662
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,148
The brave heart is taking the bride.

663
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,300
He wants to marry you?

664
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,841
What? Who is he?
Where is he from?

665
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,444
What does he do? What does he look like?
He wants to marry her!

666
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:46,672
They love each other.

667
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,573
So what did you say?

668
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:52,276
What could I say?
I said he must ask my parents.

669
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:53,352
What did she tell him?

670
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,682
She's our daughter...

671
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,121
...she wouldn't give any answer
without our consent.

672
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:02,456
Zooni, I have complete faith in your choice.

673
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,792
Yes, my darling, tell him yes.

674
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:09,096
And we're coming to Delhi
right away to get you married.

675
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:12,205
Come quickly mama, I miss you.

676
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,039
Now where are you off to?

677
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,870
We're going to Delhi aren't we?
We'll need tickets.

678
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,281
As usual he runs away the moment
there are tears in his eyes.

679
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:27,214
God keep you mama, God keep you.

680
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,823
God keep you my child, God keep you.

681
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,000
Our daughter has found her prince.

682
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,638
She has found her prince.

683
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:54,315
When did you get your eyes checked last?

684
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:57,581
I don't remember.
Many years ago in Srinagar.

685
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:58,651
This is the problem.

686
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:04,582
We doctors go on about checkups
and no one listens.

687
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,088
These days science has
progressed so much.

688
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:10,424
What was impossible 5 years ago
is today possible.

689
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:11,861
What do you mean?

690
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:16,195
Retinal replacement can help you.

691
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:17,872
The chances are very slim...

692
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,935
...I warn you, but there is still a chance.

693
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,702
Are you saying Zooni will be able to see?

694
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,774
There's a chance...

695
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,444
We'll take the chance doctor.

696
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,212
I'll check the first available date.

697
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,194
There won't be any problem doctor?

698
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,467
The operation must go well.

699
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:49,134
Don't worry our best team is on it.

700
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,370
I'll meet you after the operation.

701
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:04,641
Rehan! You're hugging me
for the 10th time.

702
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:11,888
I'm not complaining but please don't worry.
I'll be fine.

703
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:16,995
If you're so worried then why didn't
we wait for mama and papa?

704
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,599
We could have done this after the wedding?

705
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,664
Let's go, it's time.

706
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:31,939
Don't forget to get mama and papa
from the station.

707
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,839
And Jolly Good wants to
come here later as well.

708
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:37,175
You're going to the
President's Palace, right?

709
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:38,353
Yes.

710
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:03,110
I love you very much.

711
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:09,547
I know.

712
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,553
After the bomb blast in Peshawar...

713
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,225
...Pakistan the Independent Kashmir Front
has demanded...

714
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,656
...that both India and
Pakistan leave Kashmir.

715
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:20,886
They want an Independent Kashmir...

716
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:26,399
...or else there will be many more
attacks to come.

717
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:45,252
The Chief Minister is alive...

718
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:49,254
...but as per early reports,
8 security officers have been killed.

719
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,484
And at least 15 others are
badly wounded.

720
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:55,593
The main building has not been
harmed very much...

721
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:59,757
...but the left side of it has been
completely destroyed.

722
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,093
2 terrorists have been captured and...

723
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:04,272
...the IKF have claimed responsibility.

724
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:07,931
Their demand is that India
and Pakistan leave Kashmir.

725
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,941
And let it be an independent country.

726
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,806
My Child

727
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,314
Mama I can see, I can see.

728
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:49,984
Yes, my darling.

729
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:58,150
Papa I can see.
You can cry in front of me now papa.

730
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:06,662
I can see you cry. But where is Rehan?
He's not with you?

731
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,769
Didn't he get you from the station?

732
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:18,504
Papa, where are they taking us?

733
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:24,513
Why has your breathing changed papa?
Why? I don't understand.

734
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,447
Mama, where is Rehan?
Why aren't we waiting for him?

735
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:35,687
Mama why are you crying?
Mama? Papa?

736
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:44,362
Why are you crying mama?
Papa where are we?

737
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,032
Please let me go from here.

738
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,210
Is it necessary to do this now?
- Yes Ma'am.

739
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:49,377
What do we have to do?

740
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:53,378
Why can't we wait for Rehan? Papa,
where are we? Papa?

741
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:55,049
I'm getting suffocated here papa.

742
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,718
Please let's go. Mama let's go. Please.

743
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,386
The bomb blast at the President's Palace.

744
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,612
What do we have to do with that?
We don't know anything.

745
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:09,163
You're still crying mama, please don't.
Please papa get me out. Doctor?

746
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:16,561
I was going to identify him,
but his state was such that I could not.

747
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:19,307
So you have to identify him, Zooni.
Is this Rehan?

748
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:27,580
No! It can't be Rehan. It can't!

749
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:33,016
Please, don't make my daughter
go through this. Please.

750
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:38,189
It's compulsory.

751
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:53,104
Zooni my darling, even this is life.

752
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,376
If only I was a roll of wool

753
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,613
wrapped around her fingers...

754
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:19,294
That fragrance on your breath is me.

755
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:23,463
How ever will you stop, not breathe?

756
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:32,311
How can you love me so much?
How can anyone love another so much?

757
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:41,915
Don't come close to me,
this storm will destroy you.

758
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:55,492
Think about it, if I go today
I won't come back tomorrow.

759
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,848
At this time we are at the
Bureau of Military Intelligence.

760
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,018
There is not much information
forthcoming on the blast...

761
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:13,188
...but here is the head of the
Anti-Terrorist Unit.

762
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:17,086
Mr. Susheel Rawat. Mr. Rawat.
What can you tell us about the blast?

763
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,691
When we know more.
We'll tell you more.

764
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:24,525
But something to go on,
who is responsible.

765
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,696
These media people.

766
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,699
They start 24 hour channels
and then get after us to fill the time.

767
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:30,697
Everything is under control.

768
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,973
Sir, Tyagi has been called from
intelligence agency RAW

769
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:39,106
Tyagi? Now things will be out of control.

770
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:45,446
So Tyagi, case solved yet?

771
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:54,889
So what does your psychology
mumbo-jumbo say?

772
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,225
This is his work.

773
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,902
Who? Who are you talking about?

774
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,568
These two are telling the truth.

775
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:08,239
They haven't seen him.
They were simply given instructions.

776
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,811
The master planner is someone else.

777
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:15,341
Do you need an invitation
to tell me his name? Who is it?

778
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:20,821
This man has changed the face of the IKF.

779
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:27,585
He has taken a rag-tag group
and made it a professional organization.

780
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:30,425
A group on par with the most
deadly in the world.

781
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:37,496
On par with the best
intelligence agencies in the world.

782
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,104
It's because of this man that 8 ships and...

783
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:43,710
...a large part of the Bombay port
are under water.

784
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,838
It's because of this man
that Islamabad airport's...

785
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,878
...new wing was destroyed even
before it could be completed.

786
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:54,518
He has changed the face of terrorism
in India and Pakistan

787
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,126
Those blood shot eyes and...

788
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,961
...fanatical terrorists are a thing of the past.

789
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,800
This man is a thinker. A planner.
No one knows his name.

790
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:15,136
No one knows his past,
or where he comes from.

791
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:16,637
He can be anyone.

792
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:19,837
The man sitting next to you on the train...

793
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:23,811
...or a bank teller, or even the
cigarette seller outside.

794
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:29,818
He is intelligent and he's dangerous,
and he can be anyone.

795
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,160
We have to find him.

796
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:36,491
For if we don't, he can take
terrorism to a level beyond...

797
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:39,333
...our imagination because our
imagination is be nothing like his.

798
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:33,381
I'm sorry Grandfather, the mission
was not entirely successful.

799
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:35,887
I had set everything.

800
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:37,718
Those fools just didn't follow instructions.

801
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:41,893
Not everyone can be like my grandson.
A perfect soldier.

802
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:49,396
But even he slipped this once.
That too for some woman.

803
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:53,237
It's very unusual that
you were carried away like this.

804
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:55,402
And the woman what about her?

805
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:56,407
She is with God.

806
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:00,243
Now listen to me.

807
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,747
You don't have to worry about this soldier sir.

808
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:04,518
My concentration was, is...

809
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,517
...and will always remain
on our independence.

810
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:09,480
I am a soldier and nothing else.

811
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,423
That's all I wanted to hear my son.

812
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:16,530
Now I'll meet you after the Bangkok operation.
May God keep you.

813
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:29,771
You had taken me to my goal, Zooni.

814
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:36,585
Should never have taken you off that train.
But I became weak.

815
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:38,609
And I fell in love with you.

816
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:42,885
I hope you can forgive me.

817
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:46,955
I should never have brought you
into my life. Never.

818
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,042
God be with you, Zooni.

819
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:29,594
You are the Defense Secretary.

820
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:32,969
Do something.
Get that Tyagi off my back!

821
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:35,176
Last year the Al-Qaeda's attempt
on Delhi airport...

822
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,174
...was foiled by Tyagi.

823
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:38,670
She got lucky, once.

824
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,507
And now she thinks she's a
big shot intelligence officer.

825
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,343
I can't do anything now.

826
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:45,679
The Defense Minister himself
has asked her to be on this case.

827
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:48,179
Sir, it's nothing less than the Armageddon.

828
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:51,685
The press shouldn't even get a whiff of this.

829
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,588
This IKF has made our life hell.

830
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:56,796
First the President Palace bombing...

831
01:18:57,332 --> 01:19:00,028
...then Karachi Oil refinery
and last year it was the...

832
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:02,703
...plane hijacking. And now we hear
they've stolen parts from us,

833
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:12,945
Pakistan and Russia and are ready
with a nuclear missile!

834
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:16,781
Sir, This is their way of forcing India
out of Kashmir.

835
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:18,450
When Kashmir's ruler, Hari Singh,
decided to join India...

836
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:22,713
...in 1947, then why this talk of
independence now?

837
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,051
But the Kashmiri's had also been
promised a vote,

838
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:30,222
a referendum to decide
whether they wanted to stay a...

839
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,957
...part of India, join Pakistan
or then be independent.

840
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:37,002
All these years later they are
still to get that referendum.

841
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:38,729
What referendum are you talking about?

842
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:43,841
When half of Kashmir is occupied
by Pakistan, how is it possible?

843
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,306
A referendum needs
to include all of Kashmir,

844
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:47,414
why should it include only half?

845
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,077
This is not an India-Pakistan
issue any more.

846
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:55,084
IKF wants both India and Pakistan
to leave Kashmir.

847
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,593
They want a separate country.
An independent Kashmir.

848
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:03,254
Please, I know the history
of India and Pakistan.

849
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:05,262
Tell me about this bomb.

850
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:09,267
How powerful is this bomb,
Mrs. Tyagi, and what are the dangers?

851
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:12,473
In the last few years over 15,000 people
have been killed in Mumbai,

852
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:19,477
Oklahoma City, New York, Bali,
Madrid and London.

853
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:21,941
And losses have run into millions.

854
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:23,951
But if they use this bomb

855
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:31,723
5 million people can die.
An entire city can be destroyed.

856
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:34,955
That city can also be our capital, New Delhi.

857
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:39,133
We must stop this bomb.
Whatever it takes.

858
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:42,634
But Sir, this bomb is useless for them.

859
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,301
What do you mean?

860
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,872
The missile needs a special,
Indian made trigger.

861
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:51,145
If they don't have that,
they can't use the bomb

862
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:56,148
Only until they get the trigger.
Only until then.

863
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:59,983
Sir, there's nothing to worry about.
Outside of Delhi,

864
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:03,214
We have 6 triggers at various
military bases around the country.

865
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,159
In Rajasthan, Kutch, Darjeeling,

866
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,158
Amritsar, Leh and Kashmir.
They are safe there.

867
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:10,331
I want all the triggers brought to Delhi.

868
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:14,001
In the next 12 hours they will all be here, Sir.

869
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:17,163
Get me the Defense Minister of Pakistan,

870
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:19,506
...I want to share this information with him.

871
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:22,601
We can be sure. Just as we are
taking steps to secure the triggers,

872
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:26,109
IKF's mastermind will be
taking steps to steal them.

873
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:10,557
My unit has a 100% success
rate on missions, Sir.

874
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:13,227
And I will bring this trigger to you myself.

875
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:16,329
Be alert. IKF will be after you at every step.

876
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:17,896
If the weather holds up,
the trigger will be...

877
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:21,227
...with you in 3 hours, Sir.
Glory to India!

878
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:22,233
Glory to India!

879
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:26,233
This is the day every soldier lives for.

880
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:28,274
For a chance to serve his country.

881
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:31,104
The last time you saved me from the IKF.

882
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:34,180
Today we both must save the
country from the IKF.

883
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:40,749
This soldier is ready to take
lives or to give his own life.

884
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:42,356
Anything for his motherland, Sir.

885
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:59,370
Good news. The trigger will be
with us soon. God keep Rehan!

886
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:01,508
God is great!

887
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:14,455
Mummy is fine. How are you?

888
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:16,290
Mummy will save the country

889
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:20,457
I know you wanted custard.
But Grandma has made rice...

890
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,357
...pudding with so much love, so please eat it.

891
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:24,293
What have you brought?
Rice pudding or custard?

892
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:28,193
We've checked the list of officers
coming from Kashmir.

893
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:31,370
How can it not be ok?
I have hand-picked these officers.

894
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:35,474
They are the army's very best, elite forces.

895
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:37,309
Ok, so that's where he is.

896
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:38,173
Who?

897
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,314
An ace officer from the Jat Regiment Sir,
Captain Ranjeev.

898
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:45,043
His wife reported he hadn't called her
for a couple of months.

899
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,823
She wanted to know if he was
on some secret mission.

900
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:54,326
That's wives for you. Am sure she was
after him with some pudding or such.

901
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:55,989
Poor man must have needed a break from...

902
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:57,494
...all that so he didn't call, understandable.

903
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:00,167
He didn't call his wife for two months?
Just find out,

904
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:03,064
was his last mission to do with the IKF?

905
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:10,336
Yes Ma'am. Major Suraj's regiment
was surrounded by the IKF.

906
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,844
At the last moment Captain Ranjeev's
regiment got there and saved them.

907
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:19,016
Everyone from Captain Ranjeev's regiment
was killed. Only he survived.

908
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:25,520
That's him! We have to stop him!

909
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:36,035
Sounds like the base is trying to contact us.
The signal is too weak.

910
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:51,511
It's amazing isn't it? Such a small thing
can take so many lives.

911
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:54,221
Our lives too, in it's defense - So?

912
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:55,886
I'm not afraid of dying Sir,

913
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,218
But it's better to kill for your country
than be killed

914
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:02,385
You want to kill people?
Make them eat your wife's cooking!

915
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:36,759
You are dying the death of a brave soldier.

916
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:44,765
He who dies on the battlefield goes to heaven.
God keep you.

917
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,322
Grandfather. I am not empty handed.

918
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:46,990
Praise be to God! You don't have
just a trigger there with you.

919
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:53,273
It is our decades long dream.
We have sacrificed so much for.

920
01:26:54,042 --> 01:27:05,180
You must get that trigger to us now
at any cost. Kill, or be killed.

921
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:07,513
Yes, grandfather. I will meet you in 3 hours...

922
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:11,021
...At Shikara 1 pick up point. Goodbye.

923
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:15,920
I was right. That was no accident.
He was in the helicopter.

924
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:18,362
Jam all the phone lines in the area...

925
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:21,694
...mobiles, satellite, internet, everything.

926
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,200
I want a communications blackout.

927
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:27,966
We can't jam radio signals,
we have military operations in that area

928
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:33,546
If you can't jam them, you can at least
monitor them, can't you?

929
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:36,383
Search the entire area.

930
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:40,552
How far is the road unit?

931
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:11,886
No! He's still alive.
I don't care how many bodies you saw.

932
01:32:12,293 --> 01:32:15,091
I know Rehan will reach the pick up point.

933
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:20,998
I have not given him permission to die.
He cannot die.

934
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:41,176
Quickly, call Grandpa.
Go. Fast. Papa!

935
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:51,849
Hand me the scissors please.

936
01:33:57,965 --> 01:33:59,262
Who is this, mom?

937
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:03,095
Rehan, I don't know.
Go, please sit over there.

938
01:34:08,075 --> 01:34:10,600
Is he also dead like Grandma?

939
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:12,535
Quiet! Little monkey

940
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:19,278
His pulse is quite weak.
Try the phone. Is it working now?

941
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:24,457
No papa. It's still dead.

942
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:29,451
We've done the best we could.
I'm no doctor.

943
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:31,298
What can we do?

944
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:34,798
You can't go and get a doctor in this weather.

945
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:38,301
Not 50 kilometers in this storm.
No way.

946
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:41,304
Mom! Please leave Rehan.

947
01:34:44,845 --> 01:34:46,312
Nothing darling. Nothing

948
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:50,150
Now it's up to you young man.

949
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:56,812
We can only pray you have
some reason to live.

950
01:35:01,595 --> 01:35:03,495
It can be two days?
It can be two weeks?

951
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:06,659
How can you not know when
the storm will pass?

952
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:10,333
I want an update every hour, you hear?

953
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,263
Can't you do anything right?

954
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:21,508
Till I don't see a body
I can't believe he's dead.

955
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:36,757
Don't do that Rehan.
What are you up to?

956
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:39,563
I can't hear his heartbeat.
There is no heartbeat.

957
01:35:39,767 --> 01:35:43,863
Rehan wants to hear his heartbeat,
like he hears Grandpa's.

958
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:50,036
The heart is not here, it's there.

959
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:32,017
Forgive me Zooni. I have no choice.

960
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:33,871
Do you know the cricketer Rahul Dravid?

961
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:42,307
Rahul Dravid is Rehan's father.

962
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:47,053
Because Rehan's father is dead you see,

963
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:53,386
...so mom said Rehan could choose any father.
So Rehan chose Rahul Dravid.

964
01:38:57,264 --> 01:39:00,392
Are you Mr. Dependiddle like Rahul Dravid?

965
01:39:09,843 --> 01:39:12,903
Can you also be completely
trusted like Rahul Dravid?

966
01:39:15,983 --> 01:39:17,780
That outhouse of yours is falling apart.

967
01:39:17,985 --> 01:39:20,715
Look, look the dead man is awake.

968
01:39:22,156 --> 01:39:23,521
Don't talk like that.

969
01:39:24,425 --> 01:39:30,921
When the weather is better
we'll get it fixed. It's freezing.

970
01:39:34,902 --> 01:39:38,668
Before you thank me.
Come and eat something.

971
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:09,863
Don't drink so much
you'll become a hittototomas.

972
01:40:10,504 --> 01:40:18,104
Not hittototomas, kid. Hippopotomas.
And where did you learn this word?

973
01:40:18,812 --> 01:40:22,578
From Colonel uncle.
Hitto. Hittototomas.

974
01:40:28,622 --> 01:40:31,386
Would you like something?
I'm sorry I didn't get your name.

975
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:40,496
I didn't know there were military
operations here.

976
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:44,867
There are such few of us here.
What will the militants do here?

977
01:40:45,906 --> 01:40:47,498
They can hide.

978
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:56,608
The dead man stinks so Rehan thought...

979
01:41:00,087 --> 01:41:05,389
Strange, when Zooni couldn't see
she didn't bang into a thing.

980
01:41:06,493 --> 01:41:11,430
And now that she can see,
she's constantly walking into things.

981
01:41:14,201 --> 01:41:16,499
Thank you for saving me.

982
01:41:16,703 --> 01:41:21,367
You were lucky, so you survived.
What did I do?

983
01:41:26,013 --> 01:41:29,881
Is it just the 3 of you here?

984
01:41:32,286 --> 01:41:37,622
Zooni's mother died a couple of years ago.

985
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:40,518
And left me all alone.

986
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:47,693
And before that her husband
died in a bomb blast.

987
01:41:49,169 --> 01:41:53,333
I don't know why, but Zooni
blames herself for his death.

988
01:42:02,616 --> 01:42:06,712
When will this storm end?
I must leave from here.

989
01:42:08,322 --> 01:42:11,814
It's hard to say. It might stop
tomorrow or maybe a week.

990
01:42:12,659 --> 01:42:16,493
Don't think of leaving in this
weather though.

991
01:42:17,865 --> 01:42:25,772
Certainly not in your state.
Rest a while. You are our guest.

992
01:42:55,936 --> 01:42:58,097
Dispenser of India's destiny.

993
01:42:58,872 --> 01:43:03,400
You keep teaching me things.
Tell Rehan a story.

994
01:43:03,644 --> 01:43:05,737
...Dispenser of India's destiny

995
01:43:05,946 --> 01:43:09,109
You're not a good mother.
You never tell Rehan stories.

996
01:43:09,316 --> 01:43:10,749
I don't know any stories.

997
01:43:11,585 --> 01:43:15,077
Not me. You. You're a bad boy.
Go. I'm not talking to you.

998
01:43:21,094 --> 01:43:25,861
Rehan loves you more than
you love Rehan.

999
01:43:29,269 --> 01:43:33,433
But mom Rehan already knows
the national anthem.

1000
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:34,368
Let's hear it.

1001
01:43:34,575 --> 01:43:36,440
Thou art the ruler of the minds of
all the people... Dravid,

1002
01:43:36,643 --> 01:43:40,101
...Orissa and Bengal. Dravid, Orissa and Bengal.

1003
01:43:40,314 --> 01:43:41,679
You and your Dravid fixation.

1004
01:43:41,882 --> 01:43:44,009
Dravid, Orissa and Bengal.

1005
01:43:45,819 --> 01:43:47,787
Do you know the national anthem?

1006
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:50,682
No.

1007
01:43:52,459 --> 01:43:55,519
See even the dead man doesn't know
the national anthem.

1008
01:43:55,729 --> 01:44:01,759
Please tell mom, not to teach Rehan.
The phone's dead. Tell her not to teach Rehan.

1009
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:07,564
What's this?

1010
01:44:07,774 --> 01:44:09,503
Which soldier doesn't know
the national anthem?

1011
01:44:09,843 --> 01:44:10,969
Why are you lying to the child?

1012
01:44:11,178 --> 01:44:13,146
I am not here to teach him
the national anthem,

1013
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:16,278
...and I'm not here to play with him.
I don't care if I lied to him...

1014
01:44:16,483 --> 01:44:18,451
...I'm a soldier on a mission not his father!

1015
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:25,687
Come here immediately!

1016
01:45:04,064 --> 01:45:07,795
If you don't eat vegetables
how will you slay the dragon?

1017
01:45:11,905 --> 01:45:17,275
Captain Ranjeev, come and join us.
Tell us about your life.

1018
01:45:17,544 --> 01:45:20,775
I've heard soldiers have
fascinating stories to tell.

1019
01:45:21,782 --> 01:45:25,513
I'm not hungry thank you.
I'll just go to bed.

1020
01:45:26,086 --> 01:45:28,646
Your bed has been made upstairs.
The room on the left.

1021
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:43,533
Dead man made mom cry.

1022
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:47,730
Eat your food.

1023
01:46:02,389 --> 01:46:03,151
What's this?

1024
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:06,656
Mom has sent it for you.
So you'll get better faster...

1025
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,657
...so you can leave faster.

1026
01:46:10,597 --> 01:46:11,564
But what is it?

1027
01:46:11,765 --> 01:46:12,527
Poison.

1028
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:14,597
Milk with turmeric.

1029
01:46:15,068 --> 01:46:19,664
And don't try and throw it in the WC,
it stinks it up and mom finds out.

1030
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:23,036
Don't throw it out either,
the snow gets yellow.

1031
01:46:23,243 --> 01:46:27,270
And in the wash basin the color stains it,
you'll get caught.

1032
01:46:31,618 --> 01:46:35,611
And yes! If you find some other way.

1033
01:46:35,822 --> 01:46:38,222
Please tell Rehan.
Next time Rehan will do the same.

1034
01:46:57,811 --> 01:46:58,835
It really is poison.

1035
01:47:05,919 --> 01:47:15,726
"Come closer now,
I will not come back again and again"

1036
01:47:17,230 --> 01:47:26,366
"Put your arms around me,
so I can cry again and again"

1037
01:47:31,978 --> 01:47:35,414
If only I was a roll of wool...
...wrapped around her fingers...

1038
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:48,889
"Think we will never meet again, just suppose,
not till this lifetime is forever closed"

1039
01:47:49,729 --> 01:48:00,162
"Come into my arms, hold me close,
we may never again have the night's repose."

1040
01:48:00,907 --> 01:48:10,908
"Think we'll never meet again, just suppose,
not till this lifetime is forever closed."

1041
01:48:56,863 --> 01:48:58,626
Thank you.

1042
01:49:54,888 --> 01:49:56,879
Yesterday I was very rude.

1043
01:50:00,293 --> 01:50:03,751
Actually, I'm not very good with children.

1044
01:50:09,302 --> 01:50:16,834
Am not very good with words either.
But I am good with a hammer.

1045
01:50:19,813 --> 01:50:22,077
Not everything can be done alone.

1046
01:50:30,757 --> 01:50:33,590
Rehan doesn't have a father...

1047
01:50:34,828 --> 01:50:38,821
...so he sometimes...
he won't trouble you again.

1048
01:50:43,003 --> 01:50:44,197
He's a good kid.

1049
01:50:50,877 --> 01:50:53,311
So have you forgiven me then?

1050
01:50:59,486 --> 01:51:03,013
Thing is, I spend so much time alone...

1051
01:51:04,057 --> 01:51:06,150
...that I don't know how to behave
in company any more.

1052
01:51:07,661 --> 01:51:11,290
Like this one time I went to my friend
Mihir Wohra's house for a party.

1053
01:51:11,898 --> 01:51:13,991
I asked his wife how she likes
being wife number 2.

1054
01:51:14,934 --> 01:51:19,200
Turns out she was wife number 1 and
had no idea there was a wife number 2.

1055
01:51:23,943 --> 01:51:28,209
After this I decided I would stick to
safe topics.

1056
01:51:28,882 --> 01:51:33,182
So I asked my Colonel how his son
was doing at school?

1057
01:51:33,553 --> 01:51:34,918
Now that's safe? Right?

1058
01:51:35,221 --> 01:51:39,453
Wrong. Just that day his son
had been thrown...

1059
01:51:39,659 --> 01:51:41,718
...out of school, for biting his teacher's bum.

1060
01:51:43,997 --> 01:51:47,433
And not just that.
He was sent back to apologize the...

1061
01:51:47,634 --> 01:51:49,898
...following day and he ended up
biting her other bum.

1062
01:51:56,376 --> 01:51:57,502
Close your eyes.

1063
01:52:20,967 --> 01:52:23,697
Rehan doesn't want to wash his hair.
Rehan will not wash his hair.

1064
01:52:23,903 --> 01:52:27,805
You have to wash your hair or you'll get
such big, big insects in it.

1065
01:52:28,007 --> 01:52:32,239
Let them come Rehan will take the
insects for a walk every day.

1066
01:52:32,445 --> 01:52:33,742
May I help?

1067
01:52:34,814 --> 01:52:36,076
Give it a try.

1068
01:52:36,583 --> 01:52:39,245
I'm not talking to you I'm talking to him.

1069
01:52:44,524 --> 01:52:48,483
He's such a sweet kid.
Why are you bothering him.

1070
01:52:50,063 --> 01:52:51,621
But he has to wash his hair.

1071
01:52:51,831 --> 01:52:53,696
He'll wash it when he feels like it.

1072
01:53:06,179 --> 01:53:07,874
Rehan! Look up.

1073
01:53:09,682 --> 01:53:13,140
You were right.
Everything can't be done alone.

1074
01:53:25,732 --> 01:53:27,393
Dead man is funny.

1075
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:28,965
Don't call him dead man, son.

1076
01:53:29,169 --> 01:53:31,262
Rehan likes the dead man.

1077
01:53:45,185 --> 01:53:46,948
Can I help you?

1078
01:53:48,922 --> 01:53:49,911
I'm fine. Thanks.

1079
01:53:56,996 --> 01:53:59,021
Everything can't be done alone.

1080
01:54:04,571 --> 01:54:06,436
You told us some good stories today.

1081
01:54:11,578 --> 01:54:13,307
Why have you stopped telling stories?

1082
01:54:15,648 --> 01:54:18,446
Your father talks a lot after a
couple of drinks.

1083
01:54:22,355 --> 01:54:30,785
Earlier I couldn't see. Now I've seen
too much to believe in stories.

1084
01:54:34,033 --> 01:54:38,333
Your family must be worried.
You've been missing for a few days.

1085
01:54:39,772 --> 01:54:44,641
I have no family, I never met my parents.
They died when I was 3.

1086
01:54:47,647 --> 01:54:49,046
I'm sorry you're so lonely.

1087
01:54:50,750 --> 01:54:53,218
Not at all. Why do you say that?

1088
01:54:55,455 --> 01:54:57,855
Your smile doesn't reach your eyes.

1089
01:55:04,697 --> 01:55:06,255
A soldier's life is like that.

1090
01:55:08,835 --> 01:55:12,498
There must be someone else
hidden behind that soldier

1091
01:55:15,675 --> 01:55:20,874
Perhaps. But, I don't think
I really understand him.

1092
01:55:23,449 --> 01:55:29,388
Sometimes to understand yourself, you need to
see yourself from someone else's eyes.

1093
01:55:31,858 --> 01:55:35,954
I could never get that close to anyone.

1094
01:55:40,233 --> 01:55:43,760
Why? You couldn't trust anyone?

1095
01:55:46,005 --> 01:55:47,438
I don't trust myself.

1096
01:55:49,943 --> 01:55:52,605
And then every time, a new mission, a new city.

1097
01:55:55,748 --> 01:55:58,114
I couldn't be in any one place for too long

1098
01:56:01,521 --> 01:56:04,319
Sometimes you seem very familiar.

1099
01:56:56,075 --> 01:57:00,034
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief

1100
01:57:00,246 --> 01:57:04,307
The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure.

1101
01:57:08,654 --> 01:57:12,590
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief.

1102
01:57:12,792 --> 01:57:16,455
The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure.

1103
01:57:16,662 --> 01:57:20,996
A difficult song this is, can you sing it for me pure.

1104
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:25,364
Moon blooms sugar sucking
creams the thieving thief.

1105
01:57:25,571 --> 01:57:29,507
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief.

1106
01:57:29,709 --> 01:57:33,839
The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure.

1107
01:57:50,763 --> 01:57:52,754
Surly Khadak Singh simmers
and stutter sputter go the shutters.

1108
01:57:52,965 --> 01:57:55,331
Stutter sputter go the shutters making
surly Khadak Singh simmer.

1109
01:57:57,203 --> 01:58:01,105
Surely Khadak Singh simmers
and stutter sputter go the shutters.

1110
01:58:01,307 --> 01:58:05,937
Stutter sputter go the shutters making
surly Khadak Singh simmer.

1111
01:58:06,179 --> 01:58:10,639
A difficult song this is,
can you sing it for me pure.

1112
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:12,715
Stutter sputter go the shutters.

1113
01:58:12,919 --> 01:58:14,819
Surely Khadak Singh simmers more.

1114
01:58:15,021 --> 01:58:18,980
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief.

1115
01:58:19,192 --> 01:58:23,151
The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure.

1116
01:58:23,362 --> 01:58:27,389
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief.

1117
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:31,798
The silly ant sucks sugar,
illy sugar sucking ant for sure.

1118
01:58:57,263 --> 01:58:58,389
Ripe Papaya upon the ripe tree.

1119
01:58:58,598 --> 01:58:59,826
Tree ripe or ripe Papaya?

1120
01:59:00,032 --> 01:59:01,465
The ripe tree Pinkoo picks.

1121
01:59:01,667 --> 01:59:02,691
Pinkoo picks the ripe Papaya.

1122
01:59:02,902 --> 01:59:03,493
Say it.

1123
01:59:04,670 --> 01:59:08,697
Ripe Papaya upon the ripe tree
picks 'Pinkoo ripe kapda'.

1124
01:59:08,908 --> 01:59:09,602
Kapda? Cloth?

1125
01:59:13,045 --> 01:59:18,711
Ripe Papaya upon the ripe tree,
pick on tree or Papaya ripe?

1126
01:59:18,918 --> 01:59:21,785
Pinkoo picks the ripe tree,
pinkoo picks the Papaya ripe.

1127
01:59:21,988 --> 01:59:26,550
A difficult song this is,
can you sing it for me pure.

1128
01:59:26,759 --> 01:59:28,556
Pinkoo picks the ripe tree...

1129
01:59:28,761 --> 01:59:30,729
Pinkoo picks the Papaya ripe.

1130
01:59:30,930 --> 01:59:34,923
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief.

1131
01:59:35,134 --> 01:59:39,127
The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure.

1132
01:59:39,338 --> 01:59:43,365
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
if fright freaks the thieving thief.

1133
01:59:43,576 --> 01:59:47,068
The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure.

1134
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:51,774
A difficult song this is,
can you sing it for me pure.

1135
01:59:51,984 --> 01:59:53,815
The moon booms blooms, balloons...

1136
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:55,988
...of fright freaks the thieving thief.

1137
01:59:56,189 --> 02:00:00,148
The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief.

1138
02:00:00,359 --> 02:00:04,591
The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure.

1139
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:23,678
Rehan will not call him dead man any more.

1140
02:00:24,016 --> 02:00:25,449
You're my good son.

1141
02:00:25,851 --> 02:00:32,279
Can Rehan call dead man, papa? Please?

1142
02:00:35,061 --> 02:00:35,959
Close your eyes.

1143
02:00:45,738 --> 02:00:53,509
So tell me Captain Ranjeev,
have you ever loved...

1144
02:00:54,413 --> 02:00:58,941
...a woman so deeply that
her smile made you breathless?

1145
02:01:00,186 --> 02:01:01,084
I...

1146
02:01:01,454 --> 02:01:05,390
I loved my Nafisa like that. She was...

1147
02:01:06,025 --> 02:01:06,684
Heavenly!

1148
02:01:06,892 --> 02:01:09,656
Papa, you've started again. I've told you...

1149
02:01:09,862 --> 02:01:11,989
...not to drink in front of mama's photograph.

1150
02:01:14,033 --> 02:01:17,662
"Let me sit and drink on the Mosque ground...

1151
02:01:18,337 --> 02:01:21,704
...or show me a place where God is not found"

1152
02:01:21,907 --> 02:01:24,171
Fantastic! Superb!

1153
02:01:27,546 --> 02:01:32,483
"In this life without you I have no...

1154
02:01:32,685 --> 02:01:34,676
Complaint."

1155
02:01:34,887 --> 02:01:44,353
No complaint, I have no complaint.

1156
02:01:44,664 --> 02:01:47,326
Enough papa, enough.

1157
02:01:48,067 --> 02:01:50,126
What are you doing?
We're having such a nice time.

1158
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:51,496
Let's go, papa.

1159
02:01:51,704 --> 02:02:01,875
Let me finish this drink. "In this life
without you I have no complaint.

1160
02:02:11,090 --> 02:02:21,159
But this life without you is no life anyway..."

1161
02:02:21,367 --> 02:02:26,066
"I wish I could bury my head in
your veil and cry, just cry..."

1162
02:02:34,647 --> 02:02:41,746
"Are you sure your eyes themselves
don't lack in tears, are dry, just dry?"

1163
02:02:44,290 --> 02:02:44,915
The letter 'H'

1164
02:02:51,097 --> 02:02:56,694
"How do you do, dear one?
How do you think, dear one?

1165
02:02:57,870 --> 02:03:00,771
I'm just happy oh ho ho.

1166
02:03:01,507 --> 02:03:04,101
So, you've slipped then aa ha ha."

1167
02:03:07,947 --> 02:03:14,011
"What if I let my heart live in your eyes?

1168
02:03:14,787 --> 02:03:20,589
What if I close my eyes,
and punish your heart?"

1169
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:28,425
"What can I say in praise of
the one who made you?"

1170
02:03:30,803 --> 02:03:37,606
"These nights, this clime,
this river side, this playful breeze"

1171
02:03:39,178 --> 02:03:43,512
"Time has given us such beautiful pain.

1172
02:03:43,983 --> 02:03:49,148
...I am not me anymore and
you are not the same.

1173
02:03:55,394 --> 02:04:00,195
Our hearts tremble now as they meet.

1174
02:04:01,233 --> 02:04:06,967
Like they were never apart for even a beat.

1175
02:04:09,275 --> 02:04:16,306
But you got lost and so did I.

1176
02:04:17,983 --> 02:04:20,110
After our travel together..."

1177
02:04:43,309 --> 02:04:44,640
Now you're scared.

1178
02:04:47,713 --> 02:04:54,084
Who are you? How do you know all this?

1179
02:04:57,890 --> 02:05:04,295
You can't know. What's happening to me?

1180
02:05:07,433 --> 02:05:13,736
I hear him in your voice,
your breath, it's all the same.

1181
02:05:27,786 --> 02:05:30,687
It's me. Rehan.

1182
02:05:40,599 --> 02:05:41,588
Your Rehan.

1183
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:59,879
What I did to you.
I've never forgiven myself for it.

1184
02:06:02,187 --> 02:06:06,817
I promised myself I'd stay away from you.

1185
02:06:09,528 --> 02:06:11,723
I didn't want to cause you more pain.

1186
02:06:17,503 --> 02:06:22,998
Perhaps it was God's justice that
I had to die at your doorstep.

1187
02:06:25,511 --> 02:06:34,112
But you kept me alive.
And now I want to live.

1188
02:06:36,021 --> 02:06:40,924
I want to live for you, for our son.

1189
02:06:45,631 --> 02:06:49,897
Rehan... You are Rehan?

1190
02:06:56,141 --> 02:06:59,508
My real name is Rehan Qadri.

1191
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:01,610
Kashmiri?

1192
02:07:02,648 --> 02:07:03,876
Yes.

1193
02:07:04,283 --> 02:07:05,614
Go on.

1194
02:07:07,186 --> 02:07:09,347
When I met Zooni I was on a mission.

1195
02:07:10,823 --> 02:07:12,814
And that's why you fell in love
with my daughter?

1196
02:07:13,192 --> 02:07:16,923
Promised her marriage?
Was that all a part of your mission?

1197
02:07:18,397 --> 02:07:24,131
That was my weakness.
I was not free to love.

1198
02:07:25,904 --> 02:07:29,635
I am deeply sorry and ashamed
about my selfish love.

1199
02:07:30,209 --> 02:07:34,305
And you've come back to
repeat that mistake?

1200
02:07:36,015 --> 02:07:40,111
My mission is not complete yet.
After this storm, it will be.

1201
02:07:40,352 --> 02:07:44,516
Then I will stay with Zooni
for the rest of my life.

1202
02:07:44,723 --> 02:07:46,884
Mission! Mission!
What is this great mission...

1203
02:07:47,092 --> 02:07:50,323
Because of which you're
playing with all our lives?

1204
02:07:51,096 --> 02:07:52,028
I can't say.

1205
02:07:52,231 --> 02:07:52,856
What?

1206
02:07:54,933 --> 02:07:57,595
I know my silence can go against me.

1207
02:07:58,871 --> 02:08:02,705
But I do not want to lie and
I cannot tell you the truth.

1208
02:08:04,376 --> 02:08:08,904
All I can say in my defense
is that my love is true.

1209
02:08:16,588 --> 02:08:21,651
I have given you a lot of pain,
still I am asking you to fill my wounds.

1210
02:08:23,462 --> 02:08:25,794
I know I'm not worthy of your forgiveness...

1211
02:08:27,566 --> 02:08:35,302
...but I stand before you with the hope
that you will forgive me.

1212
02:08:47,286 --> 02:08:50,449
I would not have left my Nafisa for anything.

1213
02:08:51,824 --> 02:08:55,225
God came in the way otherwise
I would've still been with her.

1214
02:08:56,995 --> 02:09:02,456
There is no reason to believe him,
but there is also no reason not to.

1215
02:09:03,669 --> 02:09:07,901
It was your decision then Zooni
and it's your decision now.

1216
02:09:34,833 --> 02:09:43,263
7 years! 7 years I have lived with the guilt
that I sent you to your death.

1217
02:09:46,345 --> 02:09:52,113
Every day I curse my self for
sending you there.

1218
02:09:54,787 --> 02:09:57,051
Do you know what it's like to live with that?

1219
02:10:03,896 --> 02:10:04,590
Look at this!

1220
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:09,598
When you were off being a great soldier...

1221
02:10:10,469 --> 02:10:12,494
...on your missions this is what I was doing.

1222
02:10:14,673 --> 02:10:21,909
I was taking parts of all these faces,
trying to make one face. Your face.

1223
02:10:22,681 --> 02:10:27,084
So I could have something to cry in front of,
something to show my son.

1224
02:10:27,286 --> 02:10:28,685
To tell him this is your father.

1225
02:10:30,422 --> 02:10:41,560
And now you say all those tears,
all that pain was for nothing? No!

1226
02:10:44,603 --> 02:10:48,300
Why should I open myself to pain again Rehan?
Why should I take you back?

1227
02:10:50,709 --> 02:10:59,674
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't believe you are still dead.

1228
02:11:02,521 --> 02:11:03,749
Give me one good reason.

1229
02:11:10,896 --> 02:11:23,070
I don't have a single good reason.
They are all bad. Each and every one.

1230
02:11:59,177 --> 02:12:03,045
I was taking parts of all these faces,
trying to make one face.

1231
02:12:32,411 --> 02:12:34,003
Why are you going?

1232
02:12:45,958 --> 02:12:49,086
Because I can't play cricket like Rahul Dravid.

1233
02:12:49,294 --> 02:12:53,060
Don't worry. Rehan will teach you.

1234
02:12:57,069 --> 02:13:01,972
I am not dependiddle either.
I can't be trusted.

1235
02:13:02,174 --> 02:13:08,773
No you are dependable for Rehan.
See Rehan has learned how to say dependable.

1236
02:13:09,214 --> 02:13:12,513
Rehan will never trouble you again.

1237
02:13:13,385 --> 02:13:17,344
He won't call you dead man.
He will have a bath himself.

1238
02:13:17,556 --> 02:13:22,152
He will not give you milk and turmeric,
but please don't go.

1239
02:13:35,273 --> 02:13:39,903
Rehan loves you more than you love Rehan.

1240
02:14:08,840 --> 02:14:09,738
Sit properly!

1241
02:14:12,077 --> 02:14:12,702
Eat!

1242
02:14:13,311 --> 02:14:15,040
Why are you venting your anger on him?

1243
02:14:16,615 --> 02:14:20,278
The one who deserves it has left
without saying a word.

1244
02:14:22,654 --> 02:14:26,317
He must be in his room.
Go tell him breakfast is ready.

1245
02:14:26,525 --> 02:14:28,959
I'm not going to stand around
in the kitchen all day for him.

1246
02:14:29,227 --> 02:14:32,219
He's gone. He said goodbye to Rehan.
Not to you.

1247
02:14:41,173 --> 02:14:48,875
No, he can't go. He can't go.

1248
02:15:18,944 --> 02:15:20,707
How dare you leave me again.
How dare you?

1249
02:15:21,213 --> 02:15:29,917
Your life is mine now, do you hear?
You can never leave me and go. Never!

1250
02:15:59,651 --> 02:16:00,379
Papa!

1251
02:16:00,585 --> 02:16:05,420
When I have your hands in mine.

1252
02:16:05,624 --> 02:16:10,584
I have with me the heavens divine.

1253
02:16:10,795 --> 02:16:15,698
When I have your hands in mine.

1254
02:16:15,901 --> 02:16:20,861
I have with me the heavens divine.

1255
02:16:21,106 --> 02:16:26,043
When you're close, this world is naught.

1256
02:16:26,244 --> 02:16:31,011
Destroyed in your love, a triumph sought.

1257
02:16:31,249 --> 02:16:36,084
When I have your hands in mine.

1258
02:16:36,288 --> 02:16:41,282
I have with me the heavens divine.

1259
02:16:41,493 --> 02:16:46,362
When you're close this world is naught.

1260
02:16:46,565 --> 02:16:51,468
Destroyed in your love, a triumph sought.

1261
02:16:51,670 --> 02:16:56,539
When I have your hands in mine.

1262
02:16:56,741 --> 02:17:01,974
I have with me the heavens divine.

1263
02:17:24,669 --> 02:17:27,467
May my life's-breath find refuge in your heart.

1264
02:17:28,573 --> 02:17:31,804
Destroyed in your love may my life depart.

1265
02:17:32,577 --> 02:17:37,480
As close as fragrances are to breath.

1266
02:17:37,682 --> 02:17:42,551
As close as songs are to lips.

1267
02:17:42,754 --> 02:17:47,691
As close as sleepless nights to memories.

1268
02:17:47,892 --> 02:17:52,295
As close as arms are to embraces.

1269
02:17:52,931 --> 02:17:58,028
As close, as close as dreams to eyes.

1270
02:17:58,236 --> 02:18:02,172
Be that close to me, oh love of mine.

1271
02:18:03,375 --> 02:18:08,176
When you're close this world is naught.

1272
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:13,147
Destroyed in your love, a triumph sought.

1273
02:18:13,418 --> 02:18:18,321
When I have your hands in mine.

1274
02:18:18,523 --> 02:18:23,756
I have with me the heavens divine.

1275
02:18:45,083 --> 02:18:49,383
Let my eyes swell with tears, let me cry today.

1276
02:18:50,155 --> 02:18:53,283
Take me in your arms, get drenched today.

1277
02:18:54,626 --> 02:18:59,256
The sea of pain trapped in my heart will explode.

1278
02:18:59,964 --> 02:19:04,128
I have so much pain your veil will be drenched.

1279
02:19:04,569 --> 02:19:09,529
As close as secrets are to heartbeats.

1280
02:19:09,741 --> 02:19:14,508
As close as raindrops are to clouds.

1281
02:19:14,713 --> 02:19:19,616
As close as the moon is to night.

1282
02:19:19,818 --> 02:19:24,312
As close as kohl is to eyes.

1283
02:19:24,989 --> 02:19:30,086
As close, as close as waves to the ocean.

1284
02:19:30,295 --> 02:19:34,994
Be that close to me, oh love of mine.

1285
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:40,203
When you're close this world is naught.

1286
02:19:40,405 --> 02:19:45,104
Destroyed in your love, a triumph sought.

1287
02:19:45,410 --> 02:19:50,438
When I have your hands in mine.

1288
02:19:50,648 --> 02:19:55,517
I have with me the heavens divine.

1289
02:19:56,654 --> 02:20:02,115
My breath was incomplete, heartbeat incomplete,
incomplete was I.

1290
02:20:02,827 --> 02:20:07,787
But now the moon is full, complete in the sky,
and now with you complete am I...

1291
02:20:30,255 --> 02:20:33,315
Give us some good news Aakash.
Can we go any further?

1292
02:20:33,525 --> 02:20:35,652
Sorry ma'am, we'll have to wait
another 2 or 3 days.

1293
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:39,990
But we have to do something Aakash.
We can't just stand around.

1294
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:46,832
No. Not the press. We can't talk to the
media about the bomb yet.

1295
02:20:47,272 --> 02:20:49,172
The order's come directly from Delhi.

1296
02:20:49,374 --> 02:20:53,674
We can't talk about the bomb
but we can talk about him.

1297
02:20:54,379 --> 02:20:59,840
Aakash! Inform the press.
Newspaper, Radio, TV.

1298
02:21:00,385 --> 02:21:03,354
The search is on for a terrorist
hiding in the outskirts of Srinagar.

1299
02:21:03,555 --> 02:21:07,514
This terrorist is badly wounded
and is wearing an army uniform.

1300
02:21:07,725 --> 02:21:09,852
He is also carrying an electronic part.

1301
02:21:10,061 --> 02:21:14,691
If you have any information
on this man please...

1302
02:21:14,899 --> 02:21:17,868
...contact your nearest police station immediately.

1303
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:24,039
Come on Rehan, drink your milk.

1304
02:21:26,311 --> 02:21:30,543
Rehan loves you more than you love Rehan.

1305
02:21:30,915 --> 02:21:37,047
No, I love Rehan much more than that
and he has to drink this milk.

1306
02:21:37,255 --> 02:21:38,222
And what about this Rehan?

1307
02:21:43,928 --> 02:21:44,895
At this time?

1308
02:21:50,935 --> 02:21:52,732
Colonel? At this time?
What's the matter?

1309
02:21:52,937 --> 02:21:56,566
I have risked life and come here
for a very important reason.

1310
02:21:59,811 --> 02:22:01,438
I've run out of rum!

1311
02:22:02,947 --> 02:22:08,078
The games destiny plays with us.
And if one is in the army their...

1312
02:22:08,953 --> 02:22:11,421
...destiny is not in their hands anyway. Cheers!

1313
02:22:16,294 --> 02:22:21,596
Rehan, if you like you can come
to my house and radio your unit.

1314
02:22:21,966 --> 02:22:23,593
You have a radio transmitter?

1315
02:22:24,369 --> 02:22:26,769
Meet the man who lives
in the middle of nowhere...

1316
02:22:26,971 --> 02:22:29,769
...and keeps a radio to keep in touch with people.

1317
02:22:29,974 --> 02:22:33,273
Always wonder why he lives out here.

1318
02:22:33,978 --> 02:22:37,277
It's late today. It'll be dark
by the time you return.

1319
02:22:37,482 --> 02:22:38,278
It's dark already.

1320
02:22:38,483 --> 02:22:40,110
Ok, so it's night already.
Come tomorrow. The weather...

1321
02:22:40,318 --> 02:22:43,617
...should be clearer as well.
Come and radio your unit then.

1322
02:22:43,821 --> 02:22:45,288
There's no need for that.

1323
02:22:45,490 --> 02:22:46,286
Why not?

1324
02:22:46,491 --> 02:22:47,287
He has just returned after 7 years.
I don't want...

1325
02:22:47,492 --> 02:22:49,289
...him to disappear for another 7.

1326
02:22:49,727 --> 02:22:54,630
You are trying to guard a soldier is it?
Rehan, do you want me to radio them?

1327
02:22:54,999 --> 02:22:56,796
No, I'll have to do it myself.

1328
02:22:57,835 --> 02:22:58,631
Of course, of course.

1329
02:22:58,836 --> 02:23:00,963
Let him give his status report then you...

1330
02:23:01,172 --> 02:23:05,131
...can keep him imprisoned here
forever, right Rehan?

1331
02:23:05,677 --> 02:23:08,145
Fine, now no more discussion.
What do they say in Punjabi?

1332
02:23:08,413 --> 02:23:10,142
Let's have a whopper of a drink.

1333
02:23:45,383 --> 02:23:49,683
Where's your father?
He was to take me to colonels' house.

1334
02:23:51,889 --> 02:23:53,186
Do you really have to go?

1335
02:23:55,893 --> 02:23:57,360
Just this last bit of work.

1336
02:23:59,897 --> 02:24:04,357
Papa takes a while to get ready.
He'll be down soon. Papa!

1337
02:24:16,914 --> 02:24:20,873
Once upon a time there was a prince,
and a princess who was blind.

1338
02:24:21,085 --> 02:24:22,712
Mom, you are telling a story?

1339
02:24:25,256 --> 02:24:27,884
One day the princess
met an ordinary man who...

1340
02:24:28,092 --> 02:24:32,051
...followed different monuments
in different cities.

1341
02:24:32,930 --> 02:24:37,230
But the princess saw the prince
hidden in that ordinary man.

1342
02:24:38,102 --> 02:24:39,899
What was the prince's name?

1343
02:24:40,772 --> 02:24:41,397
Rehan.

1344
02:24:51,616 --> 02:24:55,575
The prince saved the princess
from a huge, scary dragon.

1345
02:24:56,454 --> 02:25:01,414
The dragon had a big, red face.
Every time he opened his mouth...

1346
02:25:01,626 --> 02:25:04,254
...gigantic balls of fire would come out of it.

1347
02:25:04,462 --> 02:25:05,929
What was the dragon's name?

1348
02:25:07,965 --> 02:25:09,262
Grandpa!

1349
02:25:11,969 --> 02:25:17,100
Come on Rehan, let's go to the
Colonel's and radio your unit.

1350
02:25:18,142 --> 02:25:20,770
The search is on for a terrorist hiding
in the outskirts of Srinagar.

1351
02:25:20,978 --> 02:25:23,276
This terrorist is wearing an army uniform.

1352
02:25:23,481 --> 02:25:25,449
He is also carrying an electronic part.

1353
02:25:31,155 --> 02:25:34,613
Grandpa, Rehan loves you very much.

1354
02:25:49,173 --> 02:25:53,132
I will have to go for a couple of days
to hand in my resignation.

1355
02:25:54,011 --> 02:25:58,812
Whether or not you're on this mission,
the IKF will definitely loose.

1356
02:25:59,517 --> 02:26:01,485
Terrorists can never win.

1357
02:26:02,186 --> 02:26:05,986
That's the thing. These people are not terrorists.
They are fighting for their independence.

1358
02:26:06,924 --> 02:26:09,825
And who will run this country of theirs?
The IKF?

1359
02:26:10,194 --> 02:26:14,824
No. Whoever the people of Kashmir elect.
In fair elections.

1360
02:26:15,867 --> 02:26:20,327
It seems you're not against the IKF,
you're for of them.

1361
02:26:45,229 --> 02:26:48,858
You are a traitor.
You may be my daughter's husband,

1362
02:26:49,233 --> 02:26:51,701
...but I'll gladly kill you.

1363
02:26:52,236 --> 02:26:56,866
I was doubtful when I saw the news on the TV,
but by then it was too late.

1364
02:26:59,076 --> 02:27:03,206
I had my doubts. But today I was certain...

1365
02:27:03,414 --> 02:27:07,214
...when I found this trigger in your pocket.

1366
02:27:09,587 --> 02:27:13,045
You can't do anything now.
I am going to radio the...

1367
02:27:13,257 --> 02:27:18,559
...military and hand you over.
Colonel! Colonel!

1368
02:27:20,665 --> 02:27:24,567
Please sir, give me that trigger.
All this will be over in a couple of days.

1369
02:27:24,769 --> 02:27:26,896
Then I can stay with Zooni
and Rehan forever.

1370
02:27:27,104 --> 02:27:29,902
I'd rather they be dead.
I'll never give you this. Never.

1371
02:27:42,286 --> 02:27:44,254
Don't you dare, Rehan!

1372
02:27:45,790 --> 02:27:47,257
No!!

1373
02:27:53,464 --> 02:27:57,264
No!!

1374
02:28:20,491 --> 02:28:25,793
My son. Rehan!
God be praised a million times.

1375
02:28:25,997 --> 02:28:30,457
You're alive! Do you have what I want?

1376
02:28:31,669 --> 02:28:33,637
Yes, I have it with me.

1377
02:28:33,871 --> 02:28:34,963
What's the matter?

1378
02:28:35,339 --> 02:28:40,299
I'm tired that's all.
I just want all this to end.

1379
02:28:40,511 --> 02:28:40,977
Look here...

1380
02:28:41,178 --> 02:28:45,308
I know what I have to do.
Come here and take what it is you want.

1381
02:28:47,018 --> 02:28:52,479
The coordinates here are loc rep 34,74...

1382
02:28:54,025 --> 02:28:56,493
...mount 2730, 500 house.

1383
02:28:58,529 --> 02:29:02,829
That was him. Thank God
he hasn't reached his people yet.

1384
02:29:03,034 --> 02:29:05,832
There is very heavy fog right now. We'll try and be...

1385
02:29:06,771 --> 02:29:11,333
...there tomorrow morning.
God be with you.

1386
02:29:23,387 --> 02:29:27,346
Sorry ma'am he gave his location in code.
We'll need some time to break it.

1387
02:29:29,794 --> 02:29:31,352
Give Ranade the code to break.

1388
02:29:31,562 --> 02:29:33,029
Keep the ground search going.

1389
02:29:33,230 --> 02:29:37,030
And continue monitoring the
frequency he called from.

1390
02:29:37,234 --> 02:29:40,863
We only have till tomorrow morning.
Contact the base camp.

1391
02:29:41,072 --> 02:29:43,199
Are they ready with the sketch of the
imposter of Captain Ranjeev?

1392
02:30:04,261 --> 02:30:06,559
Papa!!

1393
02:30:12,436 --> 02:30:15,564
Papa! Someone help us please!

1394
02:30:23,948 --> 02:30:25,916
Mom, what's happened?

1395
02:30:30,454 --> 02:30:33,912
Papa! Papa!

1396
02:30:53,310 --> 02:30:54,607
Mom! What happened?

1397
02:30:56,814 --> 02:30:59,942
Nothing, go watch some TV.

1398
02:31:03,154 --> 02:31:05,122
Rehan. Papa...

1399
02:31:05,322 --> 02:31:09,122
I've just left him at Colonel uncle's.
They're both drinking rum.

1400
02:31:11,495 --> 02:31:14,464
He said he'll stay there tonight.

1401
02:31:17,501 --> 02:31:21,301
The search is on for a terrorist
hiding in the outskirts of Srinagar.

1402
02:31:21,505 --> 02:31:25,805
This terrorist is badly wounded
and is wearing an army uniform.

1403
02:31:26,010 --> 02:31:28,979
He went missing 8 days ago.

1404
02:31:29,180 --> 02:31:31,307
He has an electronic part with him.

1405
02:31:31,515 --> 02:31:34,143
This is a sketch of him provided by the army.

1406
02:31:34,351 --> 02:31:37,980
If you see this man anywhere
please don't try and catch him your self.

1407
02:31:38,189 --> 02:31:39,315
He is armed and dangerous.

1408
02:31:39,523 --> 02:31:41,991
Please contact your nearest police...

1409
02:31:42,193 --> 02:31:44,491
...station immediately.
Or call this number.

1410
02:34:03,834 --> 02:34:07,463
Hello! Hello! Can someone hear me?

1411
02:34:07,838 --> 02:34:09,965
Ma'am someone is sending an
SOS from the same frequency.

1412
02:34:10,174 --> 02:34:12,301
Hello. Hello. Yes we read you.

1413
02:34:12,509 --> 02:34:16,570
Hello, can someone hear me?

1414
02:34:16,780 --> 02:34:18,042
Hello, yes, we can hear you.

1415
02:34:18,249 --> 02:34:22,845
I am Malini Tyagi from the
anti terrorist special forces. Who is this?

1416
02:34:24,021 --> 02:34:31,655
I am Zooni Ali Beg. My husband.
I thought he was dead.

1417
02:34:32,129 --> 02:34:38,125
But he came back 9 days ago.
I think he's the one you are looking for.

1418
02:34:40,204 --> 02:34:45,164
He may have killed my father
and my uncle. Or not.

1419
02:34:46,076 --> 02:34:53,710
I don't know. Just please help us.
I am alone. It's just me and my son.

1420
02:34:53,917 --> 02:34:57,751
Zooni, Zooni don't panic.
And listen to me carefully.

1421
02:34:58,389 --> 02:35:01,586
Does your husband have
some sort of an electronic part?

1422
02:35:01,792 --> 02:35:10,461
Yes, I saw it on TV. It's with me.

1423
02:35:11,068 --> 02:35:18,201
It's him. Your husband is the one
we are looking for. He is the terrorist.

1424
02:35:23,447 --> 02:35:27,781
Listen to me carefully Zooni.
I am going to tell you the most...

1425
02:35:27,985 --> 02:35:30,818
...important thing you will ever hear.
If he leaves with that trigger,

1426
02:35:31,021 --> 02:35:33,581
...if he joins his comrades they will...

1427
02:35:33,991 --> 02:35:38,325
...use a nuclear bomb over our country.

1428
02:35:38,595 --> 02:35:40,859
Millions of Indians will die.

1429
02:35:41,799 --> 02:35:47,328
One of them can be my daughter.
Another can be your son.

1430
02:35:48,772 --> 02:35:50,262
There will be complete destruction...

1431
02:35:50,541 --> 02:35:55,911
...and the only one who can
stop it Zooni, is you!

1432
02:35:57,848 --> 02:36:02,012
But, he is my husband.

1433
02:36:02,219 --> 02:36:04,585
Tell me you will help us Zooni.

1434
02:36:05,989 --> 02:36:10,653
Tell me you will stop him.
Whatever it takes.

1435
02:36:13,564 --> 02:36:14,258
Yes.

1436
02:36:16,300 --> 02:36:19,269
We have your location now Zooni.

1437
02:36:19,536 --> 02:36:20,901
We know where you are...

1438
02:36:21,572 --> 02:36:23,267
...we'll be there tomorrow morning.

1439
02:36:23,474 --> 02:36:24,372
Ok.

1440
02:37:20,697 --> 02:37:27,865
Who are you running away from?
From me? From your Rehan?

1441
02:37:29,273 --> 02:37:33,232
I have only one Rehan. My son.

1442
02:37:36,647 --> 02:37:38,774
Papa? What happened?

1443
02:37:40,818 --> 02:37:43,343
Nothing son. Everything is fine.

1444
02:37:49,493 --> 02:37:53,520
What's the point?
You'll kill him as well.

1445
02:37:55,833 --> 02:37:57,323
I'd rather die first.

1446
02:37:57,901 --> 02:38:00,096
You killed Papa quite easily.

1447
02:38:05,008 --> 02:38:10,207
I didn't kill him.
It was an accident.

1448
02:38:13,617 --> 02:38:14,914
And Colonel Uncle?

1449
02:38:26,697 --> 02:38:28,358
Give me the trigger Zooni.

1450
02:38:29,433 --> 02:38:30,331
No.

1451
02:38:35,105 --> 02:38:36,504
Give me that trigger!

1452
02:38:38,442 --> 02:38:43,277
What will you do?
Kill me as well? Kill me.

1453
02:38:43,881 --> 02:38:48,284
I've already died once because of you,
why not once again.

1454
02:38:50,687 --> 02:38:54,316
Zooni, despite all my lies.

1455
02:38:55,526 --> 02:38:57,756
Despite all the pain I have given you.

1456
02:38:59,029 --> 02:39:04,194
Do you believe that I love you?

1457
02:39:07,704 --> 02:39:08,966
Then for the sake of that love.

1458
02:39:10,240 --> 02:39:15,007
You have to do what I say.
If you don't give me that trigger...

1459
02:39:15,679 --> 02:39:19,376
...then they will torture and
kill Rehan right in front of us.

1460
02:39:20,918 --> 02:39:22,510
Then they'll kill you in front of me.

1461
02:39:23,754 --> 02:39:27,622
Then if they have any mercy,
then they will kill me too

1462
02:39:29,560 --> 02:39:32,028
And the person to do all this
will be no stranger.

1463
02:39:33,096 --> 02:39:37,999
My own grandfather will destroy
his family with his own hands.

1464
02:39:40,070 --> 02:39:41,594
I don't care about myself Zooni,

1465
02:39:42,706 --> 02:39:45,436
but I am not willing to
sacrifice Rehan or you.

1466
02:39:49,012 --> 02:39:59,911
This is the only way we'll be able to
live our lives in peace again.

1467
02:40:03,560 --> 02:40:06,961
And what about the lives of those millions
that will die from the bomb?

1468
02:40:07,431 --> 02:40:12,459
No one will use the bomb. It's just a threat.
The governments...

1469
02:40:12,669 --> 02:40:14,933
...of India and Pakistan will have
no other choice, but to give in.

1470
02:40:21,445 --> 02:40:26,678
After all your lies, how can I believe you now?

1471
02:40:31,555 --> 02:40:32,681
Grandfather

1472
02:40:34,758 --> 02:40:39,058
Or the Indian army whom I called.

1473
02:40:49,806 --> 02:40:52,172
No. Grandfather.

1474
02:40:56,146 --> 02:40:59,547
You can't leave.

1475
02:41:04,921 --> 02:41:11,656
Take care of Rehan and yourself.
I'll be back tomorrow.

1476
02:41:32,349 --> 02:41:39,812
Rehan! Please for our son's sake. Stop!

1477
02:43:37,974 --> 02:43:40,033
Why Rehan? Why?

1478
02:43:45,982 --> 02:43:50,715
Rehan loves you more than you love Rehan.

1479
02:43:50,954 --> 02:43:55,220
Don't say that. Please don't.

1480
02:44:05,602 --> 02:44:10,096
Now I'm not scared.

1481
02:44:38,034 --> 02:44:42,869
When I have your hands in mine

1482
02:44:43,073 --> 02:44:48,010
I have with me heavens divine

1483
02:44:48,211 --> 02:44:53,148
When I have your hands in mine

1484
02:44:53,350 --> 02:44:58,253
I have with me heavens divine

1485
02:44:58,455 --> 02:45:03,392
When you're close this world is naught

1486
02:45:03,593 --> 02:45:08,292
Destroyed in your love, a triumph sought

1487
02:45:09,165 --> 02:45:12,464
It's easy to choose
between right and wrong.

1488
02:45:13,370 --> 02:45:16,066
But to choose the greater of two goods...

1489
02:45:16,273 --> 02:45:22,678
...or the lesser of two evils.
Those are the choices of our life.

1490
02:45:30,253 --> 02:45:32,551
Rehan loves you very much

1491
02:45:36,226 --> 02:45:38,786
And Zooni loves Rehan very much.
