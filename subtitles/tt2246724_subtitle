Ghanchakkar (2013)
By YaSH069 @ ExDR

2
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,076
How is it?

3
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,500
How is what?

4
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,337
What you are eating.

5
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,835
It's salty.

6
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,311
I suggest you cook from tomorrow

7
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:34,810
If I cook, what will you do?

8
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:37,404
I'll watch TV all day...
just like you do.

9
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,501
Hello...

10
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,301
Sanj u...

11
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,944
Yes, mom?

12
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,172
Had dinner?

13
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,910
I'm having right now.

14
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:51,805
Now?

15
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:55,337
Did she cook or call for
a take away?

16
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,141
Trust me, she's no good.

17
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,741
Mom, I'll call you later.

18
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:03,007
Why later?

19
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:05,069
Is the wretch sitting with you?

20
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,235
There goes your mom again.

21
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,740
Mom, I said I'll call later!

22
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,835
Sanju...

23
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,043
Yes?

24
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,908
It's Pandit.

25
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:17,943
Pandit who?

26
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:19,468
Remember Babu?

27
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,469
Babu Fruit?

28
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,208
Yes.

29
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,908
How is he?

30
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,744
He's up in heaven.

31
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,244
How did that happen?

32
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:37,512
He hung himself from the
prison window using his underwear!

33
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:40,105
Why did you call?

34
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,336
Babu spoke highly of you.

35
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,046
He said you are the best.

36
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,737
Good bye.

37
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:46,607
There's this thing...

38
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:47,973
What thing?

39
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,114
I'll tell you when we meet.

40
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:53,068
I don't want to meet.

41
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,172
100 million.

42
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,678
What's that?

43
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:12,803
The population of Bihar!

44
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,974
It's your share.

45
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,311
I don't want it.

46
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,906
Relax, take your time.

47
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,112
Quick job, low risk, bumper jackpot.

48
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:23,202
Think about it...

49
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,038
this is my number.

50
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,007
What do they want?

51
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:00,870
I didn't ask.

52
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:04,907
You didn't ask?

53
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,773
We decided we wouldn't do it again.

54
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:09,934
Didn't we?

55
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,608
We did but...

56
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,204
you wouldn't go to prison for asking!

57
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:16,940
100 million is a big amount!

58
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:21,207
You want money?

59
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:22,712
Who doesn't?

60
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:27,804
We have enough to lead
a good life for a few years.

61
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:28,868
Then what?

62
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:33,179
Lead a good life for a few years
and then...

63
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,677
starve to death?

64
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,041
You want me to take it up,
don't you?

65
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,306
I didn't say that.

66
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:43,277
It's not about what you said.

67
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,313
I'll do it, if you want me to.

68
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,609
You'll have enough to get
a lifetime subscription of...

69
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:51,338
Vogue.

70
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,669
Do you want Femina too?

71
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,609
You and your mother...
It's useless talking to both...

72
00:06:58,667 --> 00:06:59,202
Why do you...

73
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:00,940
wear such loud and weird clothes?

74
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:03,544
Loud?

75
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:04,675
Weird?

76
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,543
This is fashion.

77
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,843
You would know if you
ever went through a magazine.

78
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,846
You've grown old already.

79
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,039
You've lost your mind staying
at home all the time.

80
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:38,045
When can we meet?

81
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,909
That was superfast.

82
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:40,672
Goodbye...

83
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,542
Tomorrow night, 12:30...

84
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,546
Andheri railway station,
platform number one.

85
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:45,671
Wear a red shin.

86
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:46,711
Isn't that too late?

87
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,736
And I don't wear red.

88
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,246
Red shin, Andheri,
platform number one.

89
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:52,170
Don't forget.

90
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:52,904
Hello?

91
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,604
Sanj u...

92
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:23,138
I'm Pandit.

93
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:26,207
This is ldris.

94
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,774
The train will be here soon.
Get in.

95
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,641
Where are we going?

96
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,202
Paradise!

97
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,605
You just have to get in.

98
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:51,911
You have a ticket?

99
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,978
It's okay, neither do we!

100
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:01,671
When you're carrying this...
no one asks for a ticket.

101
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:24,543
Where are we going?

102
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,510
Nowhere.

103
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:34,580
This is our conference room,
where we conduct meetings.

104
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:37,503
In a train?

105
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:39,545
Idris here...

106
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:42,071
was born in a train...

107
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,437
grew up travelling in them...

108
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:48,570
he's sentimental about trains.

109
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:51,145
Not just any train.

110
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,879
Only the Virar Fast.

111
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:55,411
What's the job?

112
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,411
What's the hurry?

113
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,877
Let's get to know each other.

114
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,038
I don't want to.

115
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,008
You better talk or I'm getting off
at the next station.

116
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:05,910
Dude!

117
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,107
Shove your attitude up your behind!

118
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:11,746
Or I'll throw you off before we get
to the next station.

119
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,801
That's enough.

120
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,748
The job's easy if we do it right.

121
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:26,443
On the 5th of every month...

122
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,001
Pandit...

123
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:28,443
One minute.

124
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:40,714
I have a railway pass...
first class.

125
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,745
AnYihing else?

126
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:43,102
Vegetables.

127
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,810
Do you have carrots?

128
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:44,777
No.

129
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,834
What do you have?

130
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,776
Brinjal.

131
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,938
You' re so mean.

132
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:53,774
You want your wife to cook
mashed brinjal at this hour?

133
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,746
I have a first class railway pass...

134
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,773
And I have this...

135
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:01,910
You want to come in?

136
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:03,677
Listen...

137
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:04,711
Brinjal?

138
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:10,709
What?

139
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:12,705
Scram!

140
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,376
On the 5th of every month...

141
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:23,508
200 million is deposited
at ABI Bank to pay salaries.

142
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,911
This time it will be 300 million.

143
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:28,677
It's Diwali...

144
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:31,437
festival bonus.

145
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:35,943
About 40-50 million will be
the regular cash.

146
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:39,843
We can easily take that.

147
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,380
We can easily deactivate
the alarm and CCTV.

148
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:52,915
The cash locker in the bank
is an advanced thing.

149
00:11:56,733 --> 00:12:01,478
It's not easy to break in.

150
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,643
This is where you do your thing.

151
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:16,275
It's not easy.

152
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,803
If it were, the bank
wouldn't keep the cash there.

153
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,334
What's my share?

154
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,460
All three get an equal share.

155
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:38,807
I need some time to think.

156
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:40,642
Okay... how long?

157
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:42,543
About a week.

158
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:43,572
Of course.

159
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:44,873
I mean...

160
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,840
we're talking about breaking
into a bank...

161
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,574
not stealing fruits from
the neighbour's backyard.

162
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:54,614
So, a few days is fine.

163
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,710
And you'll also discuss this
with your wife...

164
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,305
I don't recollect her name though...

165
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:06,903
Neetu...

166
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,678
Neetu!

167
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,710
Right, Neetu.

168
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:14,373
Neetu...

169
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:17,639
You have to ask your wife.

170
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,577
How do you know her name?

171
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,904
Just like we know
about the 350 million.

172
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:39,407
Neetu...

173
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:50,934
Femina?

174
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,610
Cosmo!

175
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:59,471
And keep your unfashionable comments
to yourself.

176
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:01,439
Okay, whatever saves my skin.

177
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:05,539
What's wrong with you?

178
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:07,744
You're eating a raw brinjal.

179
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:12,138
Go and do your favourite thing...
watching TV.

180
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,476
I'll do it?

181
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:19,305
Of course, I'm sure there's
something good on one of the channels.

182
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:20,912
I meant...

183
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,680
the bank job.

184
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,709
I'll do it?

185
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,204
If I say 'yes', you'll think that...

186
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:39,143
I am a greedy wretch who
only thinks about money.

187
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:43,380
And if I say 'no' and give it a thought...

188
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,276
I wonder about all the things
we could do with a 100 million.

189
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,273
Buy a big apartment, a luxury car...

190
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,202
go on a tour of Europe.

191
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:59,737
We can buy a big LED TV for you.

192
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,438
Didn't you want one?

193
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:08,547
How much would a really big TV cost?

194
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,573
Not much...

195
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:12,078
about 300,000-400,000.

196
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:22,343
This big!

197
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:37,168
That's enough!

198
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:38,667
The candy man will be back tomorrow

199
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:17,202
Where's the other one?

200
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,405
I don't know.

201
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:20,011
Check.

202
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:24,539
Wait.

203
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:55,740
You have 45 minutes.

204
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,340
What?

205
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,012
In 45 minutes...

206
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:01,941
these guards will leave
and two others will arrive for their shift.

207
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:03,941
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

208
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:05,674
I'm sorry I didn't.

209
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,536
Anything else you haven't mentioned yet?

210
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,237
Yes.

211
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,335
What?

212
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,641
You have 44 minutes.

213
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:53,441
Who is that?

214
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,220
Let's take a look.

215
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,513
Cops...

216
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:18,935
now we're screwed.

217
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,440
Think of something.

218
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:24,546
Come here... quick.

219
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,977
Wait, wait...

220
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:30,009
Listen, stay locked up with him
in the restroom.

221
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,009
What are you staring at?
Hurry up!

222
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:42,902
Open!

223
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:47,753
What's the matter?

224
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:49,143
Cops.

225
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,578
Cops?

226
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:51,572
How can the cops be here?

227
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:53,005
I called them!

228
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,874
Why are the cops here?

229
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:58,606
I suggest you ask them yourself.

230
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:02,108
The bank has an arrangement
with the cops.

231
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:03,805
On the 5th of every month...

232
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:06,848
they come by the bank
every two hours instead of four.

233
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:11,207
Are you married?

234
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:12,333
Yes.

235
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,003
Children?

236
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:13,841
Yes.

237
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:14,811
You want to see them again?

238
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:15,504
Yes.

239
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:17,479
Then you better do as I say.

240
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,538
You should start working at that terminal.

241
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,373
You work late nights, okay?

242
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:26,445
Why don't you do it?

243
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,980
You think I look like a banker?

244
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,946
You see someone like me in
a bank only when its being robbed!

245
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,172
Listen...

246
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:33,914
I'm not doing it.

247
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,972
Open the gate.

248
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,269
Where were you?

249
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,005
What took you so long?

250
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,910
Sir, I was looking for the keys.

251
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:52,913
Right, looking for the keys.

252
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,138
Who is he?

253
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,270
He's an employee here.

254
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,142
What's his name?

255
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,111
His name... his name is...

256
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:03,237
Utpal.

257
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,041
Don't you have a wife and kids?

258
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,272
I was just leaving.

259
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:10,145
Hurry up or you'll find your kids alone
at home.

260
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:13,841
You want to come in too?

261
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:52,005
I'll be back in two hours.

262
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:54,407
You better go home.

263
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,076
Idris?

264
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:06,841
Idris...

265
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,244
ldris...

266
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:11,336
ldris...

267
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,243
The cop left?

268
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,139
Is he gone?

269
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,805
For the first time you are in
the right place at the right time.

270
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:34,775
Come.

271
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:23,939
We'll meet after three months...

272
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,035
and split our loot.

273
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,075
Why three months?

274
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:33,739
The cops will be on this case
for the next three months.

275
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,037
So we have to lay low.

276
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,320
No pomp or show...

277
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,607
No spending lavishly...

278
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:42,076
No luxurious purchases...

279
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:42,873
Neither for yourself...

280
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:44,310
Nor for your wife.

281
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,977
Not even your neighbour's wife.

282
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:48,843
Lay low... get it?

283
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:50,874
Don't even think about escaping
with the money.

284
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:53,607
Why don't you keep it instead?

285
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:00,538
What?

286
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,007
The thing is...

287
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:10,543
amongst the three of us,
only you have a family.

288
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:15,172
And you would never want it
to fall apart

289
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,610
Where do I hide it?

290
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,709
Where no one will ever find it.

291
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:36,238
See you.

292
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:04,741
Was it these guys?

293
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,477
Yes, sir. It was them.

294
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:10,577
Don't spare them.

295
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:31,571
Sanj u...

296
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,070
there's a call for you.

297
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:35,711
Who is it?

298
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:37,167
Throw it.

299
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:38,940
What if you don't catch it?

300
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,105
No chance,
I used to be a wicket keeper in college.

301
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,636
Wicket keeper?

302
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,077
More like an umpire.

303
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,501
Hello?

304
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,738
It's Pandit.

305
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,508
Pandit who?

306
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,944
Pandit... Pandit...

307
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,676
Pandit who?

308
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:05,409
Pandit!

309
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,001
Pandit!

310
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,067
Why are you screaming?
I'm not deaf.

311
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:13,937
Tonight, 12:30,
Ville Parle railway station.

312
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:16,878
<i>Wrong number.</i>

313
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,478
Who was it?

314
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:19,775
<i>Wrong number.</i>

315
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,840
What happened?

316
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,501
He hung up.

317
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:32,570
Hello...

318
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,010
If you don't meet us tonight,
I will come to your place...

319
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:38,014
and shove the magnum up your behind.

320
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:39,011
Get it?

321
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:40,603
I told you, you've dialed a wrong number.

322
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:42,772
If you call again, I'll inform the cops.

323
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:47,607
What happened?

324
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,706
He hung up.

325
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:07,541
Hello...

326
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,742
Hello...

327
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:10,702
Sanj u...

328
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:11,677
Yes, mom.

329
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,441
Had dinner?

330
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,404
I'm having right now.

331
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,974
You eat so late every night?

332
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:21,741
Mom, I'll call you later.

333
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:27,971
How is it?

334
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:30,067
How is what?

335
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:33,876
What you are eating.

336
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:41,503
There's no salt.

337
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:46,444
What are you doing?
Let me eat.

338
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,776
No salt, more salt...

339
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,713
Tell your mom to send food for you.

340
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:28,643
Sorry.

341
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,401
Look...

342
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:37,670
I'm wearing the night suit you bought.

343
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:53,673
What about the underwear I got for you?

344
00:28:57,467 --> 00:29:02,382
Why don't you find out for yourself?!

345
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,573
Stop!

346
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,277
You know what.

347
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:32,904
Oh come on!

348
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:34,302
No...

349
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:35,937
I don't want to get pregnant.

350
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:40,916
I mean, I can't tell our child
that their father is a thief.

351
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,573
Hurry up now.

352
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:53,477
Got it?

353
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:57,244
It was in there.

354
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,504
What are you doing?

355
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,946
You want Google Maps?

356
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:09,903
What was I looking for?

357
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:24,211
Never mind!

358
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:26,439
We'll try next year!

359
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:07,505
I hope you know I can fire this gun
in the dark too.

360
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,176
Who are you?

361
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:11,208
Chunky Pandey!

362
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:11,677
Get up.

363
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:14,236
Take whatever you want but let us go.

364
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,244
Who are you?

365
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:21,310
Who the hell are they?

366
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:24,407
Let's go.

367
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,636
I'm not coming with you.
Who are you?

368
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:34,934
Let's go.

369
00:31:37,734 --> 00:31:39,338
That's enough.

370
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:40,811
Shall we?

371
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,370
Where are you taking him?

372
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:45,241
At least let me get dressed.

373
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,901
You look beautiful just the way you are.

374
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:49,174
Stay here, I'll figure this.

375
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:49,870
Let's go.

376
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:51,703
If you call the cops,
we'll make sure he goes to heaven.

377
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:52,677
And you'll follow him.

378
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,773
I think he bought an apple orchard
with our money.

379
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:58,334
Come on.

380
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,640
Let's go...

381
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,542
Come on!

382
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:08,643
Come on!

383
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:11,772
This?

384
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,168
Where are we going?

385
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:23,242
At least tell me where you're taking me.

386
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,507
Carrot cake?

387
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:52,211
Salad.

388
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,442
Scram!

389
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,201
Listen...

390
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,544
Where is it?

391
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:11,309
What?

392
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,443
Where is the money?

393
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:29,511
What money?

394
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:43,140
Where did you hide it?

395
00:33:44,334 --> 00:33:46,507
What money are you talking about?

396
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:56,273
Come on...

397
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,346
Come on...

398
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:10,505
Throw him!

399
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,044
Remember anything?

400
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,977
What are you talking about
and who the hell are you?

401
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:16,341
I don't even know you.

402
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,437
Do you know God?

403
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,242
Very soon you will,
because we're sending you to Him.

404
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,109
I don't remember.

405
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:26,239
You better talk or you're dead.

406
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,711
I swear I don't remember.

407
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:30,004
I lost my memory in an accident.

408
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,107
I lost my memory.

409
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:45,541
What?

410
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,103
I neither remember you nor any money.

411
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:55,109
The three of us robbed a bank
and you hid the money, remember?

412
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:57,209
Do you?

413
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:58,940
I don't remember!

414
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:01,977
Even if I did hide the money,
I don't remember where I hid it.

415
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,877
This jerk is pulling a fast one on us.

416
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,970
Pandit...

417
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,445
He is taking us for a ride
and we're falling for it.

418
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,481
I'm on medication,
you can check with the doctor.

419
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:14,574
Okay... let's go to the doctor.

420
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:16,869
Let's go to the doctor's place.

421
00:35:16,934 --> 00:35:18,470
He won't be home.

422
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,048
You don't know where you hid
the money but...

423
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,877
you know the doctor won't be home.

424
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:28,572
What about the hospital?

425
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:29,975
Will he be there?

426
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,444
I don't know.

427
00:35:33,867 --> 00:35:34,507
Call his wife...

428
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:35,477
What?

429
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,570
Call Neetu!

430
00:35:42,867 --> 00:35:43,607
Hello... Sanju...

431
00:35:43,867 --> 00:35:44,504
Neetu...

432
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:46,547
Where are you?
Are you alright?

433
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:47,570
I'm fine.

434
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:50,504
Which hospital did we go
to after my accident?

435
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:51,470
Why?

436
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:53,877
I asked, which hospital did we go
to after my accident?

437
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,909
Fonis, but why?

438
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:57,612
Who are they?

439
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,874
Fortis...

440
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,135
Hello? Sanju?

441
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:02,411
Fortis?

442
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:06,838
We don't have money to eat
and he's getting treated at Fortis!

443
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:09,344
Amitabh Bachchan gets treated at Fonis.

444
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,175
You think you're Amitabh Bachchan?

445
00:36:13,134 --> 00:36:15,273
If we smell something
fishy at the hospital...

446
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:19,041
we'll make sure your post-mortem
happens there.

447
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,970
Pull the emergency chain!

448
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:25,177
Hey you...

449
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,210
pull the chain.

450
00:36:28,134 --> 00:36:28,805
Why?

451
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:31,110
Because someone stole your carrot.

452
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:32,510
AnYihing else?

453
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:33,443
Pull the chain.

454
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:35,444
Listen...

455
00:36:36,934 --> 00:36:38,470
pull the chain.

456
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,336
I would like to see Dr. Gulati.

457
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:49,507
He is sleeping now.

458
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:51,311
Sleeping?

459
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:53,310
He's a doctor...

460
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:55,040
he should be available 24 hours a day.

461
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,810
Wake him up, it's an emergency.

462
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:01,744
I don't think so.

463
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:07,971
What do you have to say now?

464
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,110
Just a minute.

465
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:16,208
Yes?

466
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,040
Doctor, I' m Sanj u...

467
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:25,909
Sanj ay At h ray.

468
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,171
I met with an accident a few months back...

469
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:32,339
you treated me...

470
00:37:36,134 --> 00:37:38,171
Sanjay... Sanjay Athray...

471
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:40,746
I lost my memory...

472
00:37:43,067 --> 00:37:44,410
remember?

473
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,007
He's lost his memory too.

474
00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:53,371
Sanjayw

475
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:54,777
Sanjay Athray!
Correct?

476
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,244
Please sit...

477
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,236
So, what can I do for you?

478
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:03,338
These are my friends.

479
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,001
Hello.

480
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,440
They want to know what's wrong with me...

481
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,272
they are concerned.

482
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:17,977
Just a minute...

483
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,138
Sanjay Athray...

484
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,109
You had hurt your head.

485
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:35,245
You have ante-retrograde amnesia.

486
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,301
<i>Aunty-What'?</i>

487
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:38,412
Not aunty!

488
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:40,905
Ante-retrograde am nesia.

489
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,713
The thing is,
because he hurt his head...

490
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:48,848
he remembers certain things
but not everything.

491
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:52,940
It's called partial memory loss.

492
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,747
It's possible that he could get back
his memory and then lose it again.

493
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:01,672
What now?

494
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,178
What do you mean?

495
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:10,742
I mean, are there any chances
of his memory coming back?

496
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:12,873
There is a chance...

497
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:18,617
but it's also possible that
he might lose his memory completely.

498
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,737
In cases like these anything's possible,
you know...

499
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:38,645
Satisfied? I'm going home.

500
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,841
We want our money.

501
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,935
Are you deaf?

502
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,209
The doctor said
I suffer from memory loss.

503
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:50,008
I don't remember where I hid the money.

504
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,642
Get out of my way.

505
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,906
He's walking away.

506
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,070
Didn't you hear?

507
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,147
He's lost his memory.

508
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,669
Did I tell you where I hid the money?

509
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:11,711
No.

510
00:40:14,234 --> 00:40:15,872
And you didn't ask?

511
00:40:16,634 --> 00:40:18,705
I did... a hundred times.

512
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:23,307
But you said,
the lesser I know the better it is.

513
00:40:29,134 --> 00:40:32,013
Are you going to stay
in there all night?

514
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:07,106
Want to play?

515
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:21,743
What time should I call the carpenter?

516
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:24,576
Carpenter?

517
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:31,647
I thought we were all set to break the bed.

518
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,578
Neetu...

519
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:19,578
Neetu...

520
00:42:24,534 --> 00:42:25,478
Neetu...

521
00:42:27,734 --> 00:42:28,234
Neetu...

522
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,510
Neetu...

523
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:36,675
Neetu...

524
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,610
Neetu...

525
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:40,477
Neetu...

526
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,774
Neetu?

527
00:42:45,867 --> 00:42:46,868
Hello...

528
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:48,975
Neetu is with us.

529
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,580
Sanj u...

530
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,673
You have seven days.

531
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:59,413
Or else Neetu will be
crossing the railway tracks...

532
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:01,108
and a train will mow her down.

533
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,602
You'll have to claim
her body at the morgue.

534
00:43:05,067 --> 00:43:07,911
If you harm Neetu, I won't spare you.

535
00:43:08,067 --> 00:43:09,102
Seven days.

536
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,840
Where is she? I want to talk to her.

537
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,613
Sanj u...

538
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,141
She is safe for seven days.

539
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,813
Listen, your lunch is on the table.

540
00:43:26,867 --> 00:43:27,902
What did you get for him?

541
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:28,877
Chicken Biryani.

542
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,706
Chicken Biryani...

543
00:43:31,134 --> 00:43:32,738
No bones.

544
00:43:34,067 --> 00:43:34,841
No bones.

545
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,773
Hello...

546
00:46:37,634 --> 00:46:39,511
I got tired of ringing the door-bell.

547
00:46:39,534 --> 00:46:40,512
Where were you?

548
00:46:41,334 --> 00:46:41,974
Are you alright?

549
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:42,700
Yeah.

550
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,235
Everything is good.

551
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:46,613
We didn't make her cook.

552
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:50,342
Gave her good stuff to drink and eat...
all without bones.

553
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,973
What is the meaning of this?

554
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:00,373
What is the meaning of this?

555
00:47:01,867 --> 00:47:04,507
There's been a slight change in plans.

556
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,276
We're moving in.

557
00:47:09,467 --> 00:47:13,176
Until we get our money back...

558
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:14,371
we're staying with you.

559
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,539
What? Have you lost it?

560
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,441
We're giving you an opportunity
to be with Neetu.

561
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:23,668
Make the most of it.

562
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:28,410
We aren't living with you because you have
DTH services or comfortable cushions...

563
00:47:28,467 --> 00:47:32,279
we're living here because
we don't trust you, get it?

564
00:47:41,534 --> 00:47:42,672
Only seven days!

565
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,374
Are you reminding yourself or telling us?

566
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,535
Where's our room?

567
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:56,277
It's because of you that I was kidnapped.

568
00:47:56,867 --> 00:48:00,371
Remember where you hid the money,
so that they can go.

569
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,102
And stop throwing around stuff like this.

570
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,237
Why don't you wear a salwar-kameez?

571
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,745
<i>Sabuankameez?</i>

572
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,407
Are you serious?

573
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:16,805
When we got married...

574
00:48:17,067 --> 00:48:20,276
you knew I was fashionable...
ultra-modern.

575
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:22,473
If you wanted a salwar-
kameez wearing prude...

576
00:48:22,534 --> 00:48:24,343
you should've married someone else!

577
00:48:24,734 --> 00:48:26,736
At least until the time
these jerks are here.

578
00:48:27,067 --> 00:48:29,445
Why? What's wrong with this?

579
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:34,240
Latest issue!

580
00:48:35,267 --> 00:48:38,373
You better not comment on my clothes.

581
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,143
What should I cook for them?

582
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,247
This isn't a hotel.

583
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,141
How about I add some disinfectant?

584
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:55,439
It will stink.

585
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,035
Bug killer?

586
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:05,410
What if they force us to eat?

587
00:49:08,134 --> 00:49:10,444
You don't like anything I say or do.

588
00:49:10,634 --> 00:49:13,376
Get out and try to remember
where you hid the money.

589
00:49:16,234 --> 00:49:17,372
Listen...

590
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,546
go easy on the salt.

591
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,605
Why don't you start?

592
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:04,402
What do you think?

593
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:10,540
Needs more salt.

594
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,635
I'd like some pickle.

595
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,080
Pickle with fried rice?

596
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:16,675
This is fried rice?!

597
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:27,511
Neetu... I'll get it.

598
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,440
Where is the pickle?

599
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:41,702
Neetu...

600
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,708
It was in there... you kept it yourself.

601
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:53,110
Before he forgets everything,
we have to get our money.

602
00:50:53,267 --> 00:50:56,680
He can't even find the pickle bottle,
you think he'll find the money?

603
00:50:58,334 --> 00:51:00,541
He thinks he's Salman Khan
from the film Ghajini.

604
00:51:02,133 --> 00:51:05,239
Shahrukh Khan was the actor in Ghajini.

605
00:51:07,967 --> 00:51:09,105
Idiots!

606
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,945
They don't know that Saif Ali Khan
acted in Ghajini.

607
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:12,467
Here.

608
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,340
What?!

609
00:51:29,234 --> 00:51:32,272
Let's go for a drive.

610
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:36,044
N ow?

611
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,478
Why not?

612
00:51:40,067 --> 00:51:44,573
Do you remember the late night
romantic drives...

613
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:48,039
forgotten that too?

614
00:51:50,467 --> 00:51:52,606
You and me...

615
00:51:53,667 --> 00:51:56,011
<i>empty roads...</i>

616
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,046
remember?

617
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:05,905
Let's go... we'll take my car.

618
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,877
Why are you sulking?

619
00:52:38,967 --> 00:52:40,647
Do you remember anything about that night?

620
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:44,012
I mean, where I hid the money...

621
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:46,910
I musfve said something...

622
00:52:47,267 --> 00:52:48,405
Anything at all...

623
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,201
Of course!

624
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,277
When you got home that night
you were very angry.

625
00:53:07,367 --> 00:53:08,505
Angry, but why?

626
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:13,475
A cab driver had bumped into your car
and drove away.

627
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,502
I think you took down the cab number.

628
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,110
Where is it?

629
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,310
I don't know.

630
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,248
Don't you think
you should check your wallet?

631
00:54:01,767 --> 00:54:03,144
NIH-O1 -7313.

632
00:54:06,067 --> 00:54:10,015
If I can locate this cab driver,
I'll find out where I was that night.

633
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:16,912
How will you locate the cab
with just the number?

634
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:26,074
Where can I find this cab?

635
00:54:40,467 --> 00:54:41,912
Where can I find this cab?

636
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:49,073
Go take a seat.

637
00:55:13,367 --> 00:55:15,313
Move it!

638
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,879
Why are you running?

639
00:55:24,933 --> 00:55:26,241
Why are you chasing me?

640
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,972
There's something I want to ask you.

641
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:30,105
I don't know anything.

642
00:55:30,334 --> 00:55:32,371
I made a mistake-
now what do you want?

643
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:33,805
Wait, I need to speak with you.

644
00:55:33,867 --> 00:55:35,073
No...

645
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,704
I need your help.

646
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:38,873
Help? In what way?

647
00:55:38,934 --> 00:55:42,211
Some months ago you bumped into my car
and drove away.

648
00:55:42,267 --> 00:55:44,873
You want the money, right?

649
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,072
No, I don't want any money.

650
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,341
No? Then what do you want?

651
00:55:51,267 --> 00:55:54,680
Can you tell me the locality
where you bumped into my car?

652
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:57,407
Sir, I don't remember
all the cars I bump into.

653
00:55:57,667 --> 00:55:58,941
Which car do you drive?

654
00:56:13,634 --> 00:56:16,240
I bumped into this near
Rajesh Khanna Garden.

655
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,775
There's a garden by that name?

656
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,702
Sir, I didn't name it.

657
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:30,704
Hello...

658
00:56:30,734 --> 00:56:32,008
I got the cab driver.

659
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,976
He bumped into my car
near Rajesh Khanna Garden.

660
00:56:35,634 --> 00:56:37,170
Rajesh Khanna Garden?

661
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,136
What were you doing there?

662
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,745
I don't remember.

663
00:56:41,933 --> 00:56:43,003
Just a minute...

664
00:56:43,334 --> 00:56:44,972
doesn't Uttam live nearby?

665
00:56:45,734 --> 00:56:47,236
Who is Uttam?

666
00:56:47,267 --> 00:56:49,178
Uttam!

667
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:53,014
Uttam Nagpal, your friend from college.

668
00:56:54,267 --> 00:56:55,905
The one who looks like a hero.

669
00:56:56,267 --> 00:56:57,177
Uttam...

670
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,737
Atlantic building...
that's where he lives.

671
00:57:00,867 --> 00:57:02,540
How do you know that?

672
00:57:07,067 --> 00:57:09,547
I won't know where he lives?

673
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,740
We went over for
dinner a few months ago.

674
00:57:13,234 --> 00:57:14,144
Dinner? Really?

675
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:18,643
How would I know if we didn't go?

676
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,737
Where does Uttam Nagpal live?

677
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,801
Who is that?

678
00:57:31,134 --> 00:57:33,546
The one who looks like a hero.

679
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:34,771
Oh, Uttam Nagpal...

680
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:37,244
He doesn't live here anymore.
He moved to Pali Hill.

681
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:39,608
Pali Hill? When?

682
00:57:39,667 --> 00:57:42,170
About two months ago...
he won a jackpot.

683
00:57:42,234 --> 00:57:44,714
He bought a three bedroom apartment
in Pali Hill...

684
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,101
Apsara apartment block.

685
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,740
Is Uttam in?

686
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,575
He is sleeping.
Who are you?

687
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,874
Sanju. Wake him up.

688
00:57:57,934 --> 00:58:00,471
I can't, he will fire me.

689
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,501
Come back later.

690
00:58:03,867 --> 00:58:04,971
Does he bite?

691
00:58:05,067 --> 00:58:05,875
Sometimes.

692
00:58:05,934 --> 00:58:06,912
Will he bite now?

693
00:58:06,967 --> 00:58:08,503
He's done biting for the day.

694
00:58:08,534 --> 00:58:09,808
Wait a minute...

695
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,538
Uttam?

696
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,978
You can't barge in to
someone's home like this...

697
00:58:16,067 --> 00:58:18,513
Sir... listen...

698
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:22,047
Uttam?

699
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:22,942
Sir...

700
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,205
Uttam?

701
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:25,771
Where is his bedroom?

702
00:58:25,867 --> 00:58:26,743
Sir...

703
00:58:28,867 --> 00:58:29,902
Uttam?

704
00:58:31,734 --> 00:58:32,644
Get up.

705
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:44,237
<i>[San] u'?</i>

706
00:58:44,634 --> 00:58:46,011
What brings you here?

707
00:58:46,767 --> 00:58:48,144
You haven't called in a while.

708
00:58:48,167 --> 00:58:52,741
I wanted to... guess I forgot.

709
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:55,039
This is a nice place.

710
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,805
Thanks.

711
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,721
I heard you won the jackpot.

712
00:58:59,867 --> 00:59:02,973
Yes, three months ago.

713
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:04,844
Who told you?

714
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,807
Did we meet three months ago?

715
00:59:07,867 --> 00:59:11,110
You had come to get your imported wine.

716
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,442
Why?

717
00:59:13,534 --> 00:59:15,411
Did I give you a suitcase,
for safekeeping?

718
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:21,045
Suitcase? No...

719
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,939
Was it in the newspaper
that you won the jackpot?

720
00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:25,702
Yes...

721
00:59:26,534 --> 00:59:27,604
Where is the newspaper?

722
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:28,702
Should be around.

723
00:59:29,434 --> 00:59:30,037
I want to see.

724
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,477
N ow?

725
00:59:53,467 --> 00:59:55,777
I'll call you as soon as I find it.

726
00:59:56,567 --> 00:59:58,911
But why do you want it?

727
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,010
Where is Priya?

728
01:00:15,634 --> 01:00:17,011
Priya left me.

729
01:00:17,934 --> 01:00:18,708
Why?

730
01:00:20,567 --> 01:00:23,411
She thought I was having an affair.

731
01:00:24,534 --> 01:00:25,535
With whom?

732
01:00:26,967 --> 01:00:28,037
Never mind...

733
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,421
Where were you all day?

734
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:46,674
Stop acting like my wife.

735
01:00:48,567 --> 01:00:49,170
Where were you?

736
01:00:49,633 --> 01:00:51,112
Whom is this bouquet for?

737
01:00:51,934 --> 01:00:52,742
I'll call you later.

738
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,074
What's going on?

739
01:00:54,834 --> 01:00:56,006
Happy anniversary, honey.

740
01:00:58,034 --> 01:00:59,570
You remembered?

741
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,611
How could I forget
our wedding anniversary?

742
01:01:02,433 --> 01:01:03,537
Happy anniversary.

743
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,742
You remember your wedding anniversary
but not where you hid our money!

744
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,542
I told you this jerk
is taking us for a ride!

745
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,544
You said seven days...
only two are up.

746
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,047
You have five days, get it?

747
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,578
Let go!

748
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,604
Let's eat?

749
01:01:22,334 --> 01:01:24,371
I'm sure everyone is hungry.

750
01:01:35,467 --> 01:01:36,571
How is it?

751
01:01:42,634 --> 01:01:43,476
Good.

752
01:01:46,567 --> 01:01:47,602
It's really good.

753
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,543
I don't think we'll get the money.

754
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,671
Stop being so negative.

755
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,303
Can't you see that I don't remember?

756
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:29,974
In a few days I might
not even remember you.

757
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,004
Sanj u...

758
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,508
I've told you not to
touch me after applying lotion.

759
01:02:35,567 --> 01:02:36,978
Why are you getting angry?

760
01:02:37,334 --> 01:02:38,836
It's good for the skin.

761
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,012
Makes me look five years younger!

762
01:02:42,267 --> 01:02:43,473
Don't you think so?

763
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:47,309
You think those idiots will spare us
because you have good skin?

764
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,573
I don't think it matters to you whether
we get the money or not.

765
01:02:58,267 --> 01:02:59,337
What's that supposed to mean?

766
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,641
I am as concerned about the money
as you are.

767
01:03:03,234 --> 01:03:04,542
You sure don't look concerned.

768
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:08,671
Well, at least one of us
has to remain calm.

769
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,442
Good night.

770
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,440
Doctor...

771
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,271
Why don't you call me anymore?

772
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:30,438
How is my patient feeling today?

773
01:03:30,634 --> 01:03:33,808
Not feeling good at all. I'm in pain.

774
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,902
You are in pain?

775
01:03:36,634 --> 01:03:37,612
Yes.

776
01:03:37,733 --> 01:03:39,212
<i>Where does it hurt'?</i>

777
01:03:40,467 --> 01:03:41,673
All over the body.

778
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:46,581
I had given you medicines yesterday...
don't you feel better?

779
01:03:46,634 --> 01:03:51,379
No, doctor.
I need more of your medicine.

780
01:03:52,467 --> 01:03:54,606
I guess I have to increase the dosage.

781
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:55,771
Please do so.

782
01:03:55,834 --> 01:03:57,541
Come on, open your mouth.

783
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:01,339
If you don't open your mouth,
how can I give the medicine?

784
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:02,471
Hello.

785
01:04:02,734 --> 01:04:03,235
Hello.

786
01:04:03,567 --> 01:04:05,376
A bottle of wine, please.

787
01:04:05,434 --> 01:04:06,469
Red or white?

788
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:07,438
Red.

789
01:04:08,267 --> 01:04:09,177
Address?

790
01:04:09,234 --> 01:04:10,144
Address...

791
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:13,168
just a second.

792
01:04:17,867 --> 01:04:18,845
203...

793
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,240
Building name?

794
01:04:23,867 --> 01:04:25,278
Hold on...

795
01:04:28,467 --> 01:04:29,445
Raj at Apartments...

796
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:30,867
Road?

797
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,000
Road?

798
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,778
D'Mello Road.

799
01:04:40,567 --> 01:04:43,377
Now take off your clothes...

800
01:04:44,234 --> 01:04:44,803
come on...

801
01:04:44,867 --> 01:04:46,210
Just a minute...

802
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,438
I took off my shin.

803
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,170
You took off shin.

804
01:04:51,234 --> 01:04:51,803
Pant?

805
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,500
I am taking them off too.

806
01:04:54,467 --> 01:04:59,109
Now lie down on the stretcher...
come on...

807
01:05:59,634 --> 01:06:02,171
Now the doctor wants a massage.

808
01:06:02,234 --> 01:06:04,077
<i>Where does it hurt, doctor'?</i>

809
01:06:04,134 --> 01:06:06,705
It hurts near my chest...

810
01:06:07,034 --> 01:06:08,240
Just a minute...

811
01:06:08,267 --> 01:06:09,268
Let me pull the cunain.

812
01:06:10,534 --> 01:06:12,241
Hurry up...

813
01:06:13,033 --> 01:06:16,173
it's hurting like crazy...

814
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,101
Hurry up...

815
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,736
The right one...

816
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:25,510
Come on...

817
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:28,512
massage harder...

818
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,308
Sanj u...

819
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,571
Pandit... wake up!

820
01:06:38,633 --> 01:06:39,509
What's the matter?

821
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:41,545
Ran away... ran away...

822
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,443
Sanj u ran away...

823
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:45,569
Why would he run away?

824
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:55,340
Where did he go?

825
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,640
How should I know?

826
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,111
Try calling on his phone...

827
01:07:01,467 --> 01:07:02,275
Pick up!

828
01:07:03,934 --> 01:07:05,454
He is not answering.
What do we do now?

829
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:07,647
Let's wait for him.

830
01:07:09,934 --> 01:07:11,015
What's the meaning of this?

831
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,604
What's the meaning of this?

832
01:07:15,434 --> 01:07:21,476
I hope you didn't do something to me
when I was sleeping, you perven!

833
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:23,442
You?

834
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,640
Actually, I was talking to Chanda.

835
01:07:29,334 --> 01:07:30,972
In your underwear?

836
01:07:31,034 --> 01:07:34,948
We were playing 'doctor, doctor'.

837
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,377
Doctor, doctor?

838
01:07:39,367 --> 01:07:40,971
Doctor, doctor...

839
01:07:44,967 --> 01:07:47,948
Go and get something to eat,
I'm hungry.

840
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,444
Listen...

841
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:52,673
wash your hands!

842
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,811
Sanj u...

843
01:10:29,867 --> 01:10:31,574
Sanj u...

844
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:38,405
Where did he go?

845
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:39,378
He drove away.

846
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:40,968
<i>[That was San] u'?</i>

847
01:10:41,034 --> 01:10:41,842
Yes.

848
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:42,469
Sure it was him?

849
01:10:42,534 --> 01:10:43,512
I'm sure.

850
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,370
Relax, he will come here.

851
01:10:45,434 --> 01:10:47,114
Pandit, I told you he would try to escape.

852
01:10:47,134 --> 01:10:48,112
Where will he go?

853
01:10:48,201 --> 01:10:49,407
His wife is here, and so is his apartment.

854
01:10:49,467 --> 01:10:50,268
He has to come back.

855
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,176
He's coming here.

856
01:10:52,834 --> 01:10:53,835
Wait...

857
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,246
ldris, move away...

858
01:10:59,467 --> 01:11:01,743
ldris, he's crazy, he'll drive over you.

859
01:11:05,734 --> 01:11:07,213
Pull him out of the car.

860
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,435
Beat him up.

861
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:11,371
Break his face.

862
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:12,310
Beat him up.

863
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:14,141
He is testing our patience.

864
01:11:14,234 --> 01:11:15,907
Drag him out.

865
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:20,235
Beat him up.

866
01:11:22,734 --> 01:11:23,439
Beat him up.

867
01:11:24,734 --> 01:11:27,237
Beat him up.

868
01:11:27,767 --> 01:11:29,303
Ask him about the money.

869
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:30,275
Hello doctor?

870
01:11:30,334 --> 01:11:31,312
Where are you?

871
01:11:31,367 --> 01:11:33,779
No, I can't make it today, I'm busy.

872
01:11:36,201 --> 01:11:39,774
You pervert!
Ask him about the money!

873
01:11:39,834 --> 01:11:41,472
You were running away with our money!

874
01:11:41,767 --> 01:11:45,112
Where is our money?

875
01:11:46,467 --> 01:11:47,207
In the car.

876
01:11:47,267 --> 01:11:48,245
In the car.

877
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,278
Take a look...

878
01:11:50,767 --> 01:11:52,747
In the car?

879
01:11:54,034 --> 01:11:55,775
Take a look...

880
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:57,836
You were running away with our money!

881
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:58,878
Take a look...

882
01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:02,336
You were running away with our money!

883
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:05,311
Pandit...

884
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,702
Not there?

885
01:12:07,767 --> 01:12:08,939
Got it.

886
01:12:10,734 --> 01:12:12,077
The money is here.

887
01:12:12,134 --> 01:12:13,169
Got it.

888
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,673
The money is here.

889
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,078
We got our money!

890
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:29,345
We got our money!

891
01:12:46,134 --> 01:12:48,171
Now open it!

892
01:12:48,734 --> 01:12:50,042
It's not opening.

893
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,745
I said, open the suitcase.

894
01:12:54,667 --> 01:12:55,737
Open the suitcase.

895
01:12:56,467 --> 01:12:57,741
I said, it's not opening.

896
01:12:58,034 --> 01:12:59,069
Not opening?

897
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,405
Not opening, huh?

898
01:13:03,034 --> 01:13:04,206
Not opening?

899
01:13:05,034 --> 01:13:06,308
I'll get it opened.

900
01:13:06,367 --> 01:13:08,074
Not opening?

901
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:10,045
I'll get it opened.

902
01:13:10,467 --> 01:13:11,741
Not opening?

903
01:13:12,367 --> 01:13:13,744
Not opening?

904
01:13:19,234 --> 01:13:20,269
What the...

905
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,611
Where's the money?

906
01:13:27,567 --> 01:13:28,773
I wasn't running away.

907
01:13:31,067 --> 01:13:32,603
I forgot where I live.

908
01:13:56,434 --> 01:13:56,969
Hello?

909
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:58,075
Mr. Sanj u?

910
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,510
Who is it?

911
01:13:59,567 --> 01:14:00,671
Si r, I' rn Nlohan.

912
01:14:00,967 --> 01:14:01,672
Mohan who?

913
01:14:01,967 --> 01:14:05,005
Sir, Mohan Ahuja, real estate agent.

914
01:14:05,034 --> 01:14:07,036
Sir, you called me last night.

915
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,206
I couldn't answer because
I was watching a movie.

916
01:14:11,667 --> 01:14:12,611
Mohan?

917
01:14:12,667 --> 01:14:13,627
Sir, don't you remember?

918
01:14:13,634 --> 01:14:17,207
I had taken you to check out a 3
bedroom apartment in Pali Hill...

919
01:14:17,267 --> 01:14:19,076
a few months ago...

920
01:14:23,234 --> 01:14:24,355
Pali Hill... which building?

921
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,073
Sir, Gulmohar building.

922
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,273
Sea view apartment, on the 6th floor.

923
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,177
It's a nice neighbourhood
and Hema Malini lives on the 5th floor.

924
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:35,545
You also said you were
in a hurry to move in...

925
01:14:35,601 --> 01:14:38,605
that's why I had convinced the owner
to accept cash payment.

926
01:14:38,667 --> 01:14:41,307
But you disappeared after that.

927
01:14:41,434 --> 01:14:46,110
If you are still interested,
I will talk to the owner.

928
01:14:46,534 --> 01:14:47,604
No... I'll call you.

929
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:01,608
Neetu?

930
01:15:03,334 --> 01:15:04,176
What?

931
01:15:08,334 --> 01:15:10,371
What happened to your face?

932
01:15:11,467 --> 01:15:12,571
They beat me up.

933
01:15:13,934 --> 01:15:16,278
They beat you up?

934
01:15:18,501 --> 01:15:20,242
I'm going to teach them a lesson.

935
01:15:20,367 --> 01:15:21,607
Neetu...

936
01:15:24,001 --> 01:15:27,949
I was planning on double crossing
Pandit and ldris.

937
01:15:29,134 --> 01:15:30,010
Come again?

938
01:15:30,967 --> 01:15:33,038
I spent the money, all of it.

939
01:15:34,067 --> 01:15:35,341
What?

940
01:15:36,367 --> 01:15:40,213
What did you spend 350 million on?

941
01:15:44,634 --> 01:15:45,510
I don't remember.

942
01:15:46,367 --> 01:15:48,472
How can you not remember?

943
01:15:50,901 --> 01:15:52,437
I was about to double cross them...

944
01:15:53,334 --> 01:15:57,282
How can you be sure you wanted
to double cross them?

945
01:15:58,867 --> 01:16:00,627
I wanted to buy an apartment
with that money.

946
01:16:02,267 --> 01:16:04,338
We were going to buy an apartment...

947
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,878
with our share of the loot.

948
01:16:07,301 --> 01:16:08,439
You know about it?

949
01:16:08,467 --> 01:16:09,411
Yes!

950
01:16:09,467 --> 01:16:11,003
Why didn't we buy it?

951
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:14,412
You met with the accident before
we could buy it.

952
01:16:15,934 --> 01:16:16,537
Sanj u...

953
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:21,412
you can never double cross anyone.

954
01:16:21,934 --> 01:16:24,471
You can never betray anyone.

955
01:16:24,534 --> 01:16:29,847
I know you hid the money somewhere
but now you don't remember.

956
01:16:32,267 --> 01:16:33,245
Sanj u...

957
01:16:50,834 --> 01:16:53,212
Scoundrels...

958
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,308
Get up!

959
01:16:58,367 --> 01:17:00,176
Get out of my house.

960
01:17:00,234 --> 01:17:01,440
What are you doing?

961
01:17:02,134 --> 01:17:04,080
Wake up you monsters!

962
01:17:04,134 --> 01:17:06,239
Why did you hit Sanju?

963
01:17:08,067 --> 01:17:09,808
You live here,
eat with us and you beat him up?

964
01:17:09,867 --> 01:17:10,971
Hit him as well!

965
01:17:12,801 --> 01:17:14,838
Get up!

966
01:17:16,934 --> 01:17:20,381
Hey... what's with the broom?

967
01:17:20,834 --> 01:17:23,906
I'll tell you in a minute.

968
01:17:25,001 --> 01:17:26,810
I'll tell you...

969
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,347
Neetu, please relax, it was a mistake.

970
01:17:31,167 --> 01:17:32,771
No, pack your stuff and leave.

971
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,246
Trust me, it was a mistake,
please forgive us.

972
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,404
I said sorry...

973
01:17:36,467 --> 01:17:37,343
Go and apologise to Sanju.

974
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,108
It won't happen again.

975
01:17:40,167 --> 01:17:41,168
Say something...

976
01:17:41,234 --> 01:17:44,340
Right, the pyramid!

977
01:17:46,034 --> 01:17:49,709
If you even touch my husband again...

978
01:17:49,767 --> 01:17:51,713
I'll cut your hands off.

979
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:54,411
A few more days, Neetu...

980
01:18:01,767 --> 01:18:04,407
How did my magazine get here?

981
01:18:10,134 --> 01:18:11,738
You like women in short dresses?

982
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:15,207
I like women without anything on.

983
01:18:15,867 --> 01:18:17,005
Without anything on, huh?

984
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:19,940
Shut up!

985
01:18:20,034 --> 01:18:22,344
You bloody pervert!

986
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:49,737
I can't take it anymore!

987
01:18:52,034 --> 01:18:53,672
We're still stuck where we started.

988
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57,943
The idiot doesn't remember
where the money is...

989
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:01,773
and the pace at which he
is forgetting things...

990
01:19:02,067 --> 01:19:03,307
soon he'll even forget us.

991
01:19:04,367 --> 01:19:07,177
Pandit, I have an idea.

992
01:19:24,967 --> 01:19:26,173
Baba, will this help?

993
01:19:26,234 --> 01:19:28,874
It will be hard as a tree...
go, hurry up.

994
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,641
Sit down.

995
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:34,274
Sit down.

996
01:19:35,634 --> 01:19:38,046
It's been a long time.
How can I help?

997
01:19:38,101 --> 01:19:39,045
Sit down.

998
01:19:41,101 --> 01:19:42,136
It's really bad.

999
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,042
What's bad?

1000
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:45,239
He is losing his memory.

1001
01:19:45,334 --> 01:19:48,247
He doesn't remember anything,
can you help him?

1002
01:19:48,301 --> 01:19:53,842
I help bring it together
and shake it all up.

1003
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:56,679
You have to help him remember.

1004
01:19:57,867 --> 01:19:58,845
You have lost your mind.

1005
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,743
This Baba has magical powers, he will...

1006
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,108
Magic and voodoo dolls...

1007
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,172
the three of you can go to hell.

1008
01:20:04,267 --> 01:20:05,041
Don't let him get away.

1009
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,637
Baba, mix your potion soon.

1010
01:20:09,067 --> 01:20:10,068
Stop him,

1011
01:20:10,134 --> 01:20:12,808
Don't let him get away.

1012
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,204
Baba, hurry up.

1013
01:20:15,267 --> 01:20:16,268
Get it quickly.

1014
01:20:17,567 --> 01:20:18,568
Quick!

1015
01:20:20,834 --> 01:20:21,676
Let me go.

1016
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:22,906
Make him drink it.

1017
01:20:24,567 --> 01:20:26,274
Open your mouth.

1018
01:20:34,767 --> 01:20:35,768
Drink it up.

1019
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:44,838
How soon will the potion take effect?

1020
01:20:45,567 --> 01:20:46,238
In two hours.

1021
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:49,971
My magic will do the trick and
he will remember everything in two hours.

1022
01:20:53,234 --> 01:20:55,111
I'll remember everything in two hours?

1023
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:09,004
Don't you mock me.

1024
01:21:09,867 --> 01:21:12,848
You'll remember everything
from all your past lives too!

1025
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,538
Two hours.

1026
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,604
Baba... hold on...

1027
01:21:36,534 --> 01:21:37,171
Stop the car.

1028
01:21:37,534 --> 01:21:37,841
What is it?

1029
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,004
Stop the car!

1030
01:21:39,901 --> 01:21:41,222
I remember where I hid the money.

1031
01:21:41,534 --> 01:21:42,034
What?

1032
01:21:43,167 --> 01:21:45,875
I said,
I remember where I hid the money.

1033
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:47,106
Stop the car.

1034
01:21:47,467 --> 01:21:48,468
Stop it right now!

1035
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:51,810
Where is it?

1036
01:21:51,834 --> 01:21:54,474
You can't stop here, you idiot!
Drive to the last lane...

1037
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:57,804
Don't forget...

1038
01:21:59,867 --> 01:22:04,179
Baba, Baba, you are great.
Your magic really works.

1039
01:22:07,467 --> 01:22:08,639
You remember... where is it?

1040
01:22:08,701 --> 01:22:09,941
Where did you hide it?

1041
01:22:10,834 --> 01:22:12,609
In Dilip Kumar's bungalow

1042
01:22:13,567 --> 01:22:15,478
In Dilip Kumar's bungalow

1043
01:22:15,667 --> 01:22:16,707
Baba, you are truly great!

1044
01:22:16,734 --> 01:22:18,543
Dilip Kumar from Mother India?

1045
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,772
Yes, that's right.

1046
01:22:21,034 --> 01:22:23,071
He didn't want to drink the potion...

1047
01:22:25,467 --> 01:22:25,877
but see, it actually worked.

1048
01:22:25,934 --> 01:22:28,847
Come on... let's go there.

1049
01:22:29,767 --> 01:22:30,905
Hey... what happened?

1050
01:22:34,834 --> 01:22:36,472
He is taking us for a ride.

1051
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:37,706
Bloody...

1052
01:22:37,734 --> 01:22:39,042
ldris, let him be...

1053
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:42,604
Magical Baba...
What a jackass!

1054
01:22:43,634 --> 01:22:46,478
Today is one tough day for Capricorns.

1055
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:48,613
Trying to cover all corners could backfire.

1056
01:22:48,667 --> 01:22:51,978
Reclaiming wealth will prove onerous.

1057
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:55,072
Feeding a black dog will bring luck.

1058
01:23:03,067 --> 01:23:06,981
Try to remember,
our lives are at stake here.

1059
01:23:08,001 --> 01:23:11,505
What do you think I've been trying to do?

1060
01:23:13,434 --> 01:23:15,641
How is it that you don't know where
I hid the money?

1061
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,479
I don't know because you didn't tell me.

1062
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:20,610
Really?

1063
01:23:27,867 --> 01:23:29,744
What are you doing?

1064
01:23:32,101 --> 01:23:34,172
Whose number are you looking for?

1065
01:23:35,634 --> 01:23:37,154
I'm checking if any name rings a bell.

1066
01:23:40,167 --> 01:23:40,907
Uttam?

1067
01:23:43,467 --> 01:23:45,845
Uttam was to send the newspaper cutting
of his jackpot win.

1068
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:00,134
Hello.

1069
01:24:00,734 --> 01:24:01,234
Uttam?

1070
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:02,737
No, he is not at home.

1071
01:24:03,634 --> 01:24:04,134
Where is he?

1072
01:24:04,634 --> 01:24:05,476
He went to London.

1073
01:24:06,734 --> 01:24:07,542
When?

1074
01:24:07,567 --> 01:24:08,773
A few days ago.

1075
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:12,044
When is he coming back?

1076
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,470
He is not coming back.

1077
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:15,377
What do you mean?

1078
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:19,580
I mean, he will be living in London now
and he is also selling this apartment.

1079
01:24:20,067 --> 01:24:20,738
Who are you?

1080
01:24:20,801 --> 01:24:22,576
I am Ramesh, housekeeper.

1081
01:24:22,634 --> 01:24:24,636
I will be here until the house is sold.

1082
01:24:25,767 --> 01:24:26,871
Do you have his number in London.

1083
01:24:27,034 --> 01:24:28,945
No, there's no number.

1084
01:24:29,067 --> 01:24:30,637
How can he not have a number?

1085
01:24:30,801 --> 01:24:32,109
How do you talk to him?

1086
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:33,445
You think I'm an idiot?

1087
01:24:33,534 --> 01:24:35,775
When did I say you were an idiot?

1088
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,371
All I said is I don't have his number.

1089
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,445
Uttam has moved to London.

1090
01:24:47,867 --> 01:24:49,972
What? London?

1091
01:24:50,834 --> 01:24:52,541
He didn't even inform!

1092
01:24:53,034 --> 01:24:55,674
I was sure he didn't win the jackpot.

1093
01:24:55,734 --> 01:24:57,042
Bloody liar.

1094
01:24:59,534 --> 01:25:02,879
Sanju, how can you think so?

1095
01:25:03,534 --> 01:25:05,605
He probably has a good reason
to move to London.

1096
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:07,941
Of course!
He has our money.

1097
01:25:08,767 --> 01:25:11,304
What's the matter with you?

1098
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:13,338
You suspect everyone these days.

1099
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,778
Next you will suspect even me!

1100
01:25:32,534 --> 01:25:33,740
May I ask you something?

1101
01:25:40,634 --> 01:25:43,012
You really don't remember
where the money is?

1102
01:25:44,934 --> 01:25:47,437
Or are you pretending?

1103
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:55,846
I am your wife, Sanju.
You know you can tell me.

1104
01:26:08,501 --> 01:26:09,001
Who is it?

1105
01:26:10,667 --> 01:26:11,338
I don't know.

1106
01:26:23,267 --> 01:26:24,803
650 rupees... your wine.

1107
01:26:26,401 --> 01:26:27,243
Wine?

1108
01:26:28,434 --> 01:26:29,674
I didn't call for it.

1109
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:32,505
Sir, this is 203,
Rajat Apartment, isn't it?

1110
01:26:32,567 --> 01:26:34,274
Yes, it is.

1111
01:26:35,601 --> 01:26:37,274
But I didn't call for wine.

1112
01:26:37,367 --> 01:26:40,371
Sir, you specifically asked for
an urgent delivery.

1113
01:26:40,434 --> 01:26:42,937
Why will I call for it,
I don't even drink wine.

1114
01:26:48,267 --> 01:26:49,439
You called for it?

1115
01:26:49,867 --> 01:26:51,175
Since when do you drink?

1116
01:26:52,367 --> 01:26:54,278
Since when do I drink?

1117
01:26:54,601 --> 01:26:55,705
What's wrong with you?

1118
01:26:55,767 --> 01:26:56,727
You have wine every day!

1119
01:26:56,734 --> 01:26:57,906
You called for it.

1120
01:26:58,167 --> 01:26:58,838
Wine? Me?

1121
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:01,506
You're a drunkard!

1122
01:27:01,567 --> 01:27:04,173
Sanju, please try to remember.

1123
01:27:06,434 --> 01:27:07,174
I don't remember.

1124
01:27:07,767 --> 01:27:08,905
How can you not remember?

1125
01:27:09,167 --> 01:27:10,202
I said, I don't.

1126
01:27:11,167 --> 01:27:12,578
What do you mean, you don't?

1127
01:27:12,634 --> 01:27:15,171
You musfve called for it
a few minutes ago.

1128
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,202
I said, I don't remember!

1129
01:27:21,334 --> 01:27:22,813
I don't remember!

1130
01:27:30,767 --> 01:27:33,680
You need rest, why don't you...

1131
01:27:33,734 --> 01:27:36,681
Don't tell me what to do
and what not to!

1132
01:28:06,267 --> 01:28:08,679
If he doesn't remember anything
by tomorrow...

1133
01:28:10,101 --> 01:28:12,308
we'll get rid of them the day after.

1134
01:28:22,234 --> 01:28:26,410
You think you'll remember everything
if you scream at me?

1135
01:28:31,234 --> 01:28:31,734
Yes?

1136
01:28:32,101 --> 01:28:34,103
Hello... Sanju...

1137
01:28:34,134 --> 01:28:34,839
Yes, mom?

1138
01:28:35,334 --> 01:28:36,472
Had dinner?

1139
01:28:36,534 --> 01:28:37,706
Mom, I'll call you later.

1140
01:28:46,267 --> 01:28:47,473
What are you looking for?

1141
01:28:53,767 --> 01:28:56,043
I asked, what are you looking for?

1142
01:28:56,134 --> 01:28:57,442
Where are my pills?

1143
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,045
How should I know?

1144
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:01,573
Stop throwing things around.

1145
01:29:02,034 --> 01:29:03,035
I want my pills!

1146
01:29:03,167 --> 01:29:03,702
Sanju... relax...

1147
01:29:03,767 --> 01:29:05,474
You'll find the pills.

1148
01:29:22,534 --> 01:29:23,274
What's this?

1149
01:29:24,034 --> 01:29:25,638
I kept them there.

1150
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:27,472
You've kept them?

1151
01:29:29,201 --> 01:29:31,044
How did you get them?

1152
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:33,707
What do you mean?

1153
01:29:34,467 --> 01:29:36,140
It's my money.

1154
01:29:42,767 --> 01:29:44,212
Your money?

1155
01:29:45,701 --> 01:29:46,975
Tell me the truth, Neetu.

1156
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,570
What's wrong with you?

1157
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:50,614
I've been saving for three years.

1158
01:29:50,667 --> 01:29:54,046
I told you but
I guess you don't remember.

1159
01:30:07,434 --> 01:30:08,412
Hello?

1160
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:11,044
Hello?

1161
01:30:12,467 --> 01:30:13,445
Hello?

1162
01:30:33,667 --> 01:30:34,475
Hello?

1163
01:30:38,134 --> 01:30:40,011
I'll call you later.

1164
01:30:41,167 --> 01:30:42,475
Who was it?

1165
01:30:42,534 --> 01:30:43,274
Rinki...

1166
01:30:43,967 --> 01:30:44,968
Who is Rinki?

1167
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:48,276
My sister, don't tell me
you've forgotten her as well.

1168
01:30:50,134 --> 01:30:51,135
Call her back.

1169
01:30:52,901 --> 01:30:54,642
I said, call her back.

1170
01:31:05,034 --> 01:31:06,342
She didn't answer.

1171
01:31:06,501 --> 01:31:08,821
She probably put the phone on silent
and went off to sleep.

1172
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:13,068
Call her again.

1173
01:31:13,467 --> 01:31:14,104
No.

1174
01:31:14,601 --> 01:31:15,545
I said, call again.

1175
01:31:15,901 --> 01:31:16,936
And I said, no.

1176
01:31:17,634 --> 01:31:19,910
I've had enough of your nonsense.

1177
01:31:19,967 --> 01:31:22,413
If you don't trust me, just say it.

1178
01:31:22,467 --> 01:31:23,639
I'll go away from here.

1179
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:51,500
A bottle of red wine please...

1180
01:32:52,367 --> 01:32:53,107
address?

1181
01:33:09,967 --> 01:33:10,467
Hello?

1182
01:33:10,934 --> 01:33:12,379
Where is the money?

1183
01:33:17,834 --> 01:33:18,335
Who is this?

1184
01:33:18,934 --> 01:33:20,971
Where is the money?

1185
01:33:23,901 --> 01:33:24,538
Who is this?

1186
01:33:24,567 --> 01:33:27,275
I know you have the money.

1187
01:33:27,534 --> 01:33:31,141
I also know you haven't lost your memory.

1188
01:33:31,867 --> 01:33:34,905
You can fool your wife, but not me.

1189
01:33:34,967 --> 01:33:37,573
Who the hell are you
and what money are you talking about?

1190
01:33:38,434 --> 01:33:39,874
When do I come to collect the money?

1191
01:33:56,967 --> 01:33:58,105
Where are you going?

1192
01:34:00,834 --> 01:34:02,780
Where are you going... this early?

1193
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,040
To see the doctor.

1194
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:05,101
Doctor?

1195
01:34:06,334 --> 01:34:08,109
What will he do?

1196
01:34:08,167 --> 01:34:09,976
He will only prescribe more pills.

1197
01:34:10,401 --> 01:34:12,278
We are running out of time.

1198
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,472
Which hospital was it?

1199
01:34:16,267 --> 01:34:17,245
<i>Poms.</i>

1200
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:18,506
Where is it?

1201
01:34:18,767 --> 01:34:20,007
<i>Sandra.</i>

1202
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,501
Sanj u...

1203
01:34:29,334 --> 01:34:31,109
you forgot the car keys.

1204
01:34:32,767 --> 01:34:34,508
You want me to get lost again?

1205
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:37,335
I'm taking a cab.

1206
01:34:47,034 --> 01:34:48,240
Doctor Gulati?

1207
01:34:49,034 --> 01:34:52,174
Doctor Gulati?
He is no more.

1208
01:34:52,934 --> 01:34:54,004
What do you mean?

1209
01:34:54,267 --> 01:34:55,245
He passed away.

1210
01:34:56,701 --> 01:34:58,703
What... how?

1211
01:34:59,167 --> 01:35:01,909
A car hit him while he was jogging.

1212
01:35:01,967 --> 01:35:04,140
He was declared dead on arrival.

1213
01:35:17,001 --> 01:35:17,501
Hello?

1214
01:35:17,801 --> 01:35:19,303
Doctor Gulati was killed.

1215
01:35:19,734 --> 01:35:20,234
What?

1216
01:35:20,767 --> 01:35:22,110
A car ran over him.

1217
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,004
Who?

1218
01:35:24,267 --> 01:35:25,211
I don't know.

1219
01:35:25,267 --> 01:35:27,110
It could have been an accident.

1220
01:35:27,401 --> 01:35:29,108
It's murder, not an accident.

1221
01:35:29,167 --> 01:35:32,148
I can't believe what you're saying.

1222
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:36,342
A hundred accidents take place every day,
I'm sure this one is too.

1223
01:35:36,734 --> 01:35:38,179
I told you it's murder.

1224
01:35:38,734 --> 01:35:39,269
Oh come on!

1225
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,141
Which bank do we go to?

1226
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:45,144
LDBI.

1227
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:46,906
What's our account number?

1228
01:35:47,034 --> 01:35:47,637
Why?

1229
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:50,913
Is it a crime to ask?

1230
01:35:51,334 --> 01:35:52,278
Just a minute...

1231
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:11,774
Yes, sir?

1232
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:13,837
This is my account number.

1233
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:14,902
Sure sir...

1234
01:36:17,267 --> 01:36:18,143
YES sir?

1235
01:36:18,867 --> 01:36:21,108
I want to know if I also have
a safe deposit locker.

1236
01:36:21,134 --> 01:36:22,272
Sure sir, I'll just check.

1237
01:36:23,867 --> 01:36:27,974
Sanjay Athray, you have a joint account?

1238
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,645
I think so...

1239
01:36:30,667 --> 01:36:31,975
Okay, sir, I'll check.

1240
01:36:33,067 --> 01:36:35,843
Yes sir, the locker is in Neetu's name.

1241
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:37,735
Neetu?

1242
01:36:38,201 --> 01:36:41,045
Sir, Neetu... your wife.

1243
01:36:42,334 --> 01:36:43,005
Yeah...

1244
01:36:43,934 --> 01:36:44,434
Yes sir.

1245
01:36:45,034 --> 01:36:47,878
I want to check the locker.

1246
01:36:47,934 --> 01:36:51,575
I am sorry,
but your wife has to be present for that.

1247
01:36:52,267 --> 01:36:54,611
Why? It's a joint account.

1248
01:36:54,667 --> 01:36:57,841
It is ajoint account,
but the locker is in Neetu's name.

1249
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,910
I don't care...
I want to check the locker.

1250
01:37:00,967 --> 01:37:02,139
I am sorry, sir... but your wife...

1251
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:03,178
What sorry?

1252
01:37:04,901 --> 01:37:06,812
Until you let me check the locker...

1253
01:37:06,867 --> 01:37:07,868
I won't move from here.

1254
01:37:07,934 --> 01:37:10,014
I am sorry,
but your wife has to be present for that.

1255
01:37:10,901 --> 01:37:11,743
I want to check.

1256
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,609
Sir, where are you going?

1257
01:37:13,867 --> 01:37:15,744
Security!

1258
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:18,179
Let me go!

1259
01:37:21,667 --> 01:37:23,704
I will sue all of you.

1260
01:37:25,134 --> 01:37:29,207
Don't deposit your money in this back,
they are Swindlers.

1261
01:37:32,601 --> 01:37:33,602
He is crazy.

1262
01:37:33,667 --> 01:37:35,010
I think his loan must have got rejected

1263
01:37:35,067 --> 01:37:36,137
It's a nice bank.

1264
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:37,912
Let's go.

1265
01:38:01,067 --> 01:38:01,568
Hello?

1266
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:02,808
Where is Neetu?

1267
01:38:03,534 --> 01:38:05,207
It's him, he wants to talk to Neetu.

1268
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:07,178
Where is he?

1269
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,070
Where are you?

1270
01:38:09,934 --> 01:38:10,878
You want the money?

1271
01:38:10,934 --> 01:38:11,605
What?

1272
01:38:11,967 --> 01:38:13,127
Do you want the money or not?

1273
01:38:13,601 --> 01:38:14,671
You got it?

1274
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,180
If you want it, put Neetu on.

1275
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:18,768
He's not telling where the money is.

1276
01:38:18,834 --> 01:38:21,508
Wants to talk to Neetu,
I think he got it.

1277
01:38:21,867 --> 01:38:24,245
It's in his interest to find the money.

1278
01:38:26,601 --> 01:38:27,773
Say she is in the bathroom.

1279
01:38:28,667 --> 01:38:29,667
Neetu is in the bathroom.

1280
01:38:30,067 --> 01:38:31,011
I'll wait...

1281
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:32,835
He will wait...

1282
01:38:32,867 --> 01:38:34,869
Do you have to repeat everything?

1283
01:38:50,434 --> 01:38:52,209
I think it's time to get a new TV.

1284
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:55,874
Me too. I've been thinking about it.

1285
01:38:56,167 --> 01:38:56,770
Which one?

1286
01:38:57,434 --> 01:38:58,435
Sony or Samsung?

1287
01:38:58,834 --> 01:39:00,006
Samsung is better.

1288
01:39:00,534 --> 01:39:01,706
The Samsung speakers are better.

1289
01:39:01,767 --> 01:39:03,713
But the Sony picture quality
is much better.

1290
01:39:03,767 --> 01:39:07,840
I agree,
the Sony picture quality is fabulous.

1291
01:39:08,601 --> 01:39:09,170
True.

1292
01:39:16,101 --> 01:39:17,136
Neetu...

1293
01:39:18,567 --> 01:39:20,638
it's Sanj u.

1294
01:39:29,534 --> 01:39:30,877
Stop staring at me.

1295
01:39:35,201 --> 01:39:35,701
Yes?

1296
01:39:36,067 --> 01:39:38,348
Why didn't you tell me about
the bank safe deposit locker?

1297
01:39:38,834 --> 01:39:39,437
What?

1298
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:41,509
You have a safe deposit
locker in the bank?

1299
01:39:41,567 --> 01:39:42,477
Yes, but why?

1300
01:39:42,834 --> 01:39:44,643
Why didn't you tell me about it?

1301
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:46,043
What rubbish, Sanj u.

1302
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:48,376
Of course, I have told you.

1303
01:39:48,401 --> 01:39:49,937
You never told me.

1304
01:39:50,001 --> 01:39:51,605
I told you.

1305
01:39:51,667 --> 01:39:52,907
You didn't!

1306
01:39:52,967 --> 01:39:54,674
I would remember if you did.

1307
01:39:54,834 --> 01:39:57,610
You don't remember
because you've lost your memory.

1308
01:39:57,667 --> 01:40:00,079
Don't blame everything on my memory.

1309
01:40:00,667 --> 01:40:04,479
Last month you told me you want
to cut your hair short.

1310
01:40:04,534 --> 01:40:05,410
Didn't you?

1311
01:40:07,367 --> 01:40:09,779
How is the bank locker
connected to my hair?

1312
01:40:09,867 --> 01:40:11,744
Answer my question!

1313
01:40:12,567 --> 01:40:13,671
Yes, I told you.

1314
01:40:13,734 --> 01:40:17,409
If I have lost my memory,
how do I remember this?

1315
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,471
I didn't say you've
forgotten everything.

1316
01:40:21,534 --> 01:40:23,639
You remember some things
and some you don't.

1317
01:40:23,701 --> 01:40:24,975
The doctor also said that.

1318
01:40:25,467 --> 01:40:29,108
If you had told me about the locker,
I would remember.

1319
01:40:29,401 --> 01:40:30,402
Why did you keep it from me?

1320
01:40:30,434 --> 01:40:31,572
I had told you.

1321
01:40:31,634 --> 01:40:34,012
You can believe me if you wish
or you can go to hell.

1322
01:40:34,067 --> 01:40:35,808
I can't take your nonsense anymore!

1323
01:40:37,367 --> 01:40:38,207
What's in the locker?

1324
01:40:41,534 --> 01:40:42,569
My jewellery.

1325
01:40:42,634 --> 01:40:43,612
Jewellery?

1326
01:40:43,667 --> 01:40:45,510
My wedding jewellery.

1327
01:40:45,534 --> 01:40:46,638
I want to check.

1328
01:40:46,734 --> 01:40:47,576
Why?

1329
01:40:47,634 --> 01:40:49,477
I want to check what's in the locker.

1330
01:40:49,534 --> 01:40:51,639
I told you it's the wedding jewellery.

1331
01:40:51,734 --> 01:40:52,872
Neetu, I want to check.

1332
01:40:53,734 --> 01:40:55,873
No, I won't open the locker.

1333
01:40:55,934 --> 01:40:58,540
Do you trust me or not?

1334
01:41:03,934 --> 01:41:04,776
Sanj u...

1335
01:41:06,834 --> 01:41:09,872
Do you trust me or not?

1336
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:37,835
Hello?

1337
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:40,773
Don't ever hang up on me.

1338
01:41:42,701 --> 01:41:45,807
Who are you and how did
you get my number?

1339
01:41:46,234 --> 01:41:47,595
When can I come to take the money?

1340
01:41:48,368 --> 01:41:50,314
What money are you talking about?

1341
01:41:50,767 --> 01:41:52,508
I don't have any money.

1342
01:41:52,734 --> 01:41:55,340
And stop calling me over and over.

1343
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:55,969
Fine...

1344
01:41:56,534 --> 01:42:01,415
I'll tell the cops you robbed a bank.

1345
01:42:01,901 --> 01:42:04,381
Then you can rot in jail.

1346
01:42:05,301 --> 01:42:08,680
Do you want to spend your
life rotting in jail?

1347
01:42:10,434 --> 01:42:11,708
Who are you?

1348
01:42:11,767 --> 01:42:14,543
The answer to that question
won't save you.

1349
01:42:16,334 --> 01:42:17,540
I don't have the money.

1350
01:42:18,267 --> 01:42:22,477
You know where the money
is but you don't want to tell.

1351
01:42:23,434 --> 01:42:25,914
I know you want to keep it all.

1352
01:42:25,934 --> 01:42:29,848
I will call you once again.

1353
01:42:30,367 --> 01:42:32,904
If I don't get the money...

1354
01:42:32,967 --> 01:42:36,813
the cops will get your personal details.

1355
01:42:37,367 --> 01:42:39,506
I suggest, you keep your hand inside.

1356
01:42:39,767 --> 01:42:41,610
You could easily get hurt.

1357
01:42:45,234 --> 01:42:47,510
Hello?

1358
01:42:51,501 --> 01:42:52,445
Pull over!

1359
01:42:54,334 --> 01:42:54,971
Pull over!

1360
01:42:55,234 --> 01:42:56,074
Just a minute, sir...

1361
01:43:20,801 --> 01:43:22,246
Who are you looking for?

1362
01:43:35,434 --> 01:43:36,235
A bottle of water...

1363
01:43:38,634 --> 01:43:39,840
What's up?

1364
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:43,870
How did you get hurt?

1365
01:43:44,767 --> 01:43:46,178
Remember me?

1366
01:43:46,734 --> 01:43:47,838
It's me, Mohan.

1367
01:43:48,501 --> 01:43:49,445
Mohan?

1368
01:43:49,501 --> 01:43:51,811
Sir, Mohan Ahuja, real estate agent.

1369
01:43:52,367 --> 01:43:53,327
Sorry, I don't remember.

1370
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:55,710
We spoke two nights ago.

1371
01:43:59,367 --> 01:44:00,471
How's madam...

1372
01:44:01,834 --> 01:44:03,279
she's your wife, right?

1373
01:44:07,367 --> 01:44:08,243
You know her?

1374
01:44:08,301 --> 01:44:09,177
Yes, sir.

1375
01:44:09,267 --> 01:44:10,907
I showed her an apartment
a few weeks ago.

1376
01:44:13,734 --> 01:44:14,644
When?

1377
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:17,312
I think, three weeks ago.

1378
01:44:19,401 --> 01:44:20,277
Was she alone?

1379
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,380
No, there was a gentleman with her.

1380
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:27,643
Are you sure there was a
man with her?

1381
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:30,340
Of course, that's why I remember.

1382
01:44:32,201 --> 01:44:33,646
Can you describe the man?

1383
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,778
He was quite tall and fair.

1384
01:44:37,834 --> 01:44:41,304
He mentioned his name but
I can't remember.

1385
01:44:41,367 --> 01:44:43,244
I mean, it's at the tip
of my tongue but...

1386
01:44:43,834 --> 01:44:45,507
He looks just like a hero.

1387
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:47,700
Uttam?

1388
01:44:48,234 --> 01:44:49,235
Uttam!

1389
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:50,176
That's right, Uttam!

1390
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:52,704
You have an amazing memory.

1391
01:44:54,201 --> 01:44:55,373
They bought the apartment?

1392
01:44:55,434 --> 01:44:57,471
No, sir.
It's an amazing apartment.

1393
01:44:57,534 --> 01:45:01,175
You get a clear view of the
Bandra Sea Link from the window.

1394
01:45:01,567 --> 01:45:03,740
But they wanted a bigger apartment.

1395
01:45:07,134 --> 01:45:08,738
What's wrong, sir?

1396
01:45:12,567 --> 01:45:14,740
Sir, would you like to see that apartment?

1397
01:45:17,834 --> 01:45:19,643
What took you so long?

1398
01:45:19,667 --> 01:45:22,170
Don't tell me you want
me to wait all day...

1399
01:45:22,234 --> 01:45:23,577
Where did I hail your cab this morning?

1400
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:24,476
Why?

1401
01:45:25,734 --> 01:45:26,838
Where did I hail your cab this morning?

1402
01:45:27,101 --> 01:45:28,444
15th Road, Khar...

1403
01:45:28,567 --> 01:45:29,409
Take me back.

1404
01:45:48,567 --> 01:45:49,773
Where can I buy a gun?

1405
01:45:51,034 --> 01:45:53,378
Gun? You mean like a pistol?

1406
01:45:55,434 --> 01:45:56,504
Yes, pistol.

1407
01:45:57,534 --> 01:45:58,535
No, sir.

1408
01:46:14,434 --> 01:46:15,344
Neetu...

1409
01:46:17,434 --> 01:46:18,412
Neetu...

1410
01:46:21,634 --> 01:46:24,547
What do you want?

1411
01:46:26,501 --> 01:46:28,037
Which floor do I live on?

1412
01:46:28,101 --> 01:46:30,047
What happened to your face?

1413
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:31,670
Which floor do I live on?

1414
01:46:32,267 --> 01:46:33,507
2nd floor... right side.

1415
01:46:34,767 --> 01:46:37,509
You want a pain-killer? I have...

1416
01:46:38,401 --> 01:46:39,539
I want a gun...

1417
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:42,078
do you have it?

1418
01:47:11,167 --> 01:47:12,612
Bloody wretch!

1419
01:48:26,134 --> 01:48:27,408
Dear Sanj u...

1420
01:48:27,634 --> 01:48:29,045
we've taken Neetu with us.

1421
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:32,073
If you want her back alive...

1422
01:48:32,134 --> 01:48:36,276
get into the 3rd compartment
of the last train for...

1423
01:48:36,334 --> 01:48:38,280
Virar leaving Jogeshwari station at 1:30.

1424
01:48:38,334 --> 01:48:41,338
Looking forward to seeing you,
Pandit and ldris.

1425
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:42,276
1:30...

1426
01:48:43,367 --> 01:48:45,074
1:30...

1427
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:47,908
7:30...

1428
01:51:56,167 --> 01:51:56,872
Hello...

1429
01:51:57,867 --> 01:51:59,369
When can I come to take the money?

1430
01:52:00,134 --> 01:52:01,841
You're running out of time.

1431
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:48,278
<i>[San] u'?</i>

1432
01:52:51,634 --> 01:52:53,636
You loser, we told you to
get into the third compartment.

1433
01:52:53,734 --> 01:52:54,940
Why didn't you remember?

1434
01:52:57,267 --> 01:52:57,904
Who are you?

1435
01:53:00,967 --> 01:53:01,809
Who are they?

1436
01:53:02,068 --> 01:53:03,274
You don't remember us?

1437
01:53:03,834 --> 01:53:04,710
Remember?

1438
01:53:05,834 --> 01:53:06,744
Have we met before?

1439
01:53:07,934 --> 01:53:11,177
Bloody scoundrel, I won't spare you!

1440
01:53:11,234 --> 01:53:12,355
You're going to regret this.

1441
01:53:12,667 --> 01:53:14,704
Did you hear that?

1442
01:53:14,767 --> 01:53:16,644
He doesn't remember us.

1443
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:18,737
I knew this would happen.

1444
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:21,280
I knew he would forget us
before we could get our money.

1445
01:53:21,334 --> 01:53:22,938
I knew this would happen.

1446
01:53:25,667 --> 01:53:27,169
Why are you staring at me?

1447
01:53:29,201 --> 01:53:29,701
Hey...

1448
01:53:29,734 --> 01:53:30,712
Look here...

1449
01:53:30,767 --> 01:53:32,303
look at me.

1450
01:53:33,001 --> 01:53:36,107
I'm Pandit and this is ldris, remember?

1451
01:53:38,834 --> 01:53:40,939
Okay, now listen carefully.

1452
01:53:41,367 --> 01:53:45,679
The three of us robbed a bank
and you hid the money.

1453
01:53:45,801 --> 01:53:49,749
Then you met with an accident
and lost your memory.

1454
01:53:49,801 --> 01:53:54,216
We are helping you to
remember where you hid the money.

1455
01:53:55,867 --> 01:53:58,143
We have been living at your place.

1456
01:53:58,234 --> 01:53:59,178
Remember?

1457
01:54:01,134 --> 01:54:03,136
All I remember is I'm looking
for some money.

1458
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:05,077
You are looking for our money...
our money.

1459
01:54:05,134 --> 01:54:08,206
Your money?
I don't even know you.

1460
01:54:11,601 --> 01:54:14,138
You don't know us, huh?

1461
01:54:14,867 --> 01:54:16,574
I've had enough of this.

1462
01:54:16,634 --> 01:54:20,582
When I shoot through your wife's head,
you'll remember everything.

1463
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:21,203
Sanj u...

1464
01:54:21,267 --> 01:54:22,974
it's their money.

1465
01:54:23,067 --> 01:54:25,104
You have two minutes...

1466
01:54:25,867 --> 01:54:29,610
Tell me where the money
is or your wife is dead!

1467
01:54:29,667 --> 01:54:31,669
If you kill her,
you'll never get the money.

1468
01:54:34,101 --> 01:54:34,738
What?

1469
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:39,670
She has the money.

1470
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:42,977
She and her boyfriend.

1471
01:54:46,034 --> 01:54:50,210
What nonsense, Sanj u?

1472
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:53,776
Yeah, what nonsense?

1473
01:54:54,501 --> 01:54:56,105
Are you high on something?

1474
01:54:56,201 --> 01:54:57,805
Pandit...

1475
01:54:58,034 --> 01:54:59,911
He is taking us for a ride...

1476
01:55:00,067 --> 01:55:02,240
and we're falling for it.

1477
01:55:02,567 --> 01:55:04,547
The jerk is lying!

1478
01:55:04,567 --> 01:55:07,605
I'm not lying, she has the money.

1479
01:55:07,767 --> 01:55:08,973
What rubbish?

1480
01:55:09,034 --> 01:55:09,978
Don't pretend!

1481
01:55:10,501 --> 01:55:12,021
I know everything about you and Uttam.

1482
01:55:12,901 --> 01:55:14,209
Now who is Uttam?

1483
01:55:15,034 --> 01:55:16,240
My college friend.

1484
01:55:17,601 --> 01:55:19,774
They conned me and took the money.

1485
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:25,945
Do you have any idea what you're saying?

1486
01:55:26,934 --> 01:55:28,140
How could you think like that?

1487
01:55:28,201 --> 01:55:29,771
What's got into you?

1488
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:31,902
Didn't you go with Uttam
to check an apartment?

1489
01:55:32,967 --> 01:55:34,037
Did you go or not?

1490
01:55:35,134 --> 01:55:35,908
No!

1491
01:55:36,234 --> 01:55:38,009
I didn't go with him.

1492
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:43,911
I met him outside the building where
I went to check an apartment for us...

1493
01:55:44,601 --> 01:55:46,547
he came upstairs with me.

1494
01:55:46,601 --> 01:55:48,706
Then why didn't you tell me you met him?

1495
01:55:48,767 --> 01:55:49,871
I told you.

1496
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:51,072
No, you didn't!

1497
01:55:51,134 --> 01:55:53,740
I told you, but you forgot.

1498
01:55:53,767 --> 01:55:55,747
You are lying.

1499
01:55:59,734 --> 01:56:02,442
The money has been transferred
to Uttam who's in London...

1500
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,511
and she will be joining him soon.

1501
01:56:09,601 --> 01:56:10,443
Is this true?

1502
01:56:12,467 --> 01:56:13,104
No, it's not.

1503
01:56:13,834 --> 01:56:15,745
I know nothing about the money.

1504
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:16,972
He is making it up.

1505
01:56:17,034 --> 01:56:18,069
Making it up?

1506
01:56:18,134 --> 01:56:20,944
Are you not going to London
to be with that jerk?

1507
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:21,774
Are you not?

1508
01:56:22,934 --> 01:56:23,742
No!

1509
01:56:24,134 --> 01:56:25,010
Then what's this?

1510
01:56:25,067 --> 01:56:25,841
What is it?

1511
01:56:25,901 --> 01:56:26,879
Look at this...

1512
01:56:28,834 --> 01:56:29,904
credit card statement.

1513
01:56:29,967 --> 01:56:33,039
Neetu bought a ticket for London...

1514
01:56:33,467 --> 01:56:35,572
a one way ticket.

1515
01:56:37,134 --> 01:56:39,478
Date of departure is a week later-
on the 18th.

1516
01:56:39,534 --> 01:56:40,535
Take a look.

1517
01:56:42,767 --> 01:56:47,477
Yes, I am going to London
to see my sister.

1518
01:56:47,934 --> 01:56:50,380
And you bought this ticket, not me.

1519
01:56:50,534 --> 01:56:51,410
Really?

1520
01:56:52,567 --> 01:56:54,877
I don't even know that she has a sister.

1521
01:56:54,934 --> 01:56:57,107
She doesn't have a sister, she is lying.

1522
01:56:57,467 --> 01:57:01,415
Uttam won a jackpot and moved to London.

1523
01:57:01,467 --> 01:57:05,574
She went with him to check an apartment
and now she is fleeing to London.

1524
01:57:05,701 --> 01:57:07,806
Think about it.

1525
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:22,673
Is the money here or in London?

1526
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:28,710
Trust me,
I know nothing about the money.

1527
01:57:28,767 --> 01:57:30,508
I'm going to London to see my sister.

1528
01:57:30,567 --> 01:57:33,707
He knows it but he doesn't remember.

1529
01:57:33,934 --> 01:57:37,472
He doesn't even remember you,
think about it.

1530
01:57:37,534 --> 01:57:38,706
Bloody lying wretch.

1531
01:57:39,567 --> 01:57:43,538
She blamed everything on my memory
and conned me...

1532
01:57:43,601 --> 01:57:45,342
now she's pulling a fast one on you.

1533
01:57:45,667 --> 01:57:49,581
Pandit, nowl am confused...

1534
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:51,941
who is pulling a fast one on whom?

1535
01:57:52,001 --> 01:57:52,775
Sanj u...

1536
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:54,973
Come here... into this compartment.

1537
01:57:55,034 --> 01:57:57,036
I'm not coming there. I'm going home.

1538
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:58,310
Are you coming or not?

1539
01:57:58,367 --> 01:58:02,042
Why did you come here,
if you don't won't to come in here?

1540
01:58:02,301 --> 01:58:06,511
Because I found this at home...

1541
01:58:06,534 --> 01:58:07,672
asking me to come here.

1542
01:58:10,334 --> 01:58:15,579
We left this for you.
We wrote it.

1543
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:17,610
Come here...

1544
01:58:19,334 --> 01:58:20,404
Now come in here.

1545
01:58:21,967 --> 01:58:22,741
I'm going home.

1546
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:26,444
Where do you think you're going?

1547
01:58:26,601 --> 01:58:27,671
Told you to join us.

1548
01:58:27,734 --> 01:58:28,678
Sanj u...

1549
01:58:28,734 --> 01:58:31,613
Get into this compartment...
we warn you...

1550
01:58:31,801 --> 01:58:32,643
Come.

1551
01:58:42,401 --> 01:58:42,902
Tomato?

1552
01:58:50,601 --> 01:58:51,636
Enough is enough.

1553
01:58:52,334 --> 01:58:56,510
Call your boyfriend and tell him
to send the money.

1554
01:58:56,567 --> 01:58:57,307
N ow!

1555
01:58:57,634 --> 01:59:00,308
I told you I don't have the money.

1556
01:59:00,367 --> 01:59:01,539
He said call.

1557
01:59:16,234 --> 01:59:16,735
Sir...

1558
01:59:20,401 --> 01:59:21,277
Sir...

1559
01:59:25,267 --> 01:59:25,870
Sir...

1560
01:59:26,767 --> 01:59:29,304
trust me, please trust me...

1561
01:59:29,367 --> 01:59:30,505
you will get your money.

1562
01:59:32,267 --> 01:59:34,611
Sir, trust me... you will get...

1563
01:59:40,334 --> 01:59:44,476
No, no...

1564
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:54,204
You will get your money.

1565
01:59:56,201 --> 01:59:57,544
Let me go.

1566
01:59:57,601 --> 01:59:59,308
Please forgive me.

1567
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:12,373
Please let us go...

1568
02:00:13,367 --> 02:00:14,812
Don't kill us.

1569
02:00:15,167 --> 02:00:15,702
Please.

1570
02:00:18,234 --> 02:00:19,440
Who are you?

1571
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:21,707
Why do you ask me the same thing...

1572
02:00:21,801 --> 02:00:23,576
'Who are you?'

1573
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:26,869
YOu!

1574
02:00:27,501 --> 02:00:28,571
Yes, it's me.

1575
02:00:29,834 --> 02:00:31,575
Did you think...

1576
02:00:32,567 --> 02:00:34,740
that these two idiots were
behind the robbery?

1577
02:00:36,534 --> 02:00:39,242
I gave them one last chance
but they failed at it.

1578
02:00:42,467 --> 02:00:44,174
You know what their problem was?

1579
02:00:45,434 --> 02:00:50,281
They never let their gun do the talking.

1580
02:00:51,834 --> 02:00:53,507
Please don't kill us.

1581
02:00:53,567 --> 02:00:54,773
Please...

1582
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:57,201
Please...

1583
02:01:12,834 --> 02:01:14,177
What's that?

1584
02:01:14,234 --> 02:01:15,274
What do you think this is?

1585
02:01:15,634 --> 02:01:17,113
A three course dinner?

1586
02:01:18,767 --> 02:01:22,112
Sanj u...

1587
02:01:23,367 --> 02:01:24,573
Sanj u...

1588
02:01:26,301 --> 02:01:27,439
Where is the money?

1589
02:01:31,801 --> 02:01:33,303
What money?

1590
02:01:35,301 --> 02:01:36,678
Where is the money?

1591
02:01:39,234 --> 02:01:41,441
I don't remember any money!

1592
02:01:41,634 --> 02:01:43,170
You don't remem be r?

1593
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:49,376
Do you remember her or
have you forgotten her as well?

1594
02:02:02,668 --> 02:02:03,612
Don't move.

1595
02:02:15,067 --> 02:02:16,102
Now do you remember?

1596
02:02:17,034 --> 02:02:18,172
I said, I don't remember.

1597
02:02:21,467 --> 02:02:23,469
Where is the money?

1598
02:02:24,100 --> 02:02:26,046
I don't know.

1599
02:02:28,134 --> 02:02:29,044
Sanj u...

1600
02:02:37,667 --> 02:02:39,146
Where is the money?

1601
02:02:41,334 --> 02:02:42,711
I told you, I don't remember.

1602
02:03:03,201 --> 02:03:07,240
Are you going to shoot me
like you shot this poor woman?

1603
02:03:08,267 --> 02:03:09,473
Poor woman?

1604
02:03:12,467 --> 02:03:13,741
Poor woman?

1605
02:03:16,267 --> 02:03:18,679
Do you know who this poor woman is?

1606
02:03:24,334 --> 02:03:25,312
I don't know.

1607
02:03:29,601 --> 02:03:32,775
You really don't know who she is?

1608
02:03:33,767 --> 02:03:35,269
Probably someone you know.

1609
02:03:43,267 --> 02:03:45,042
I'll never see my money again.

1610
02:03:46,234 --> 02:03:49,078
You ruined my well thought out plan.

1611
02:03:50,001 --> 02:03:51,275
They paid the price for their mistake.

1612
02:03:51,334 --> 02:03:52,244
And...

1613
02:03:54,001 --> 02:03:55,378
And you...

1614
02:04:01,101 --> 02:04:03,138
You know how I'll punish you?

1615
02:04:05,367 --> 02:04:07,005
I'll let you live.

1616
02:04:21,201 --> 02:04:23,044
You want to take my wallet?

1617
02:04:35,701 --> 02:04:36,509
Banana?

1618
02:04:38,167 --> 02:04:41,979
Banana and fork... to kill me?

1619
02:04:45,967 --> 02:04:49,471
You know the best thing about a banana?

1620
02:04:52,301 --> 02:04:53,609
You don't need to wash it clean.

1621
02:05:06,034 --> 02:05:06,637
Orange...

1622
02:05:07,201 --> 02:05:07,941
What?

1623
02:05:09,934 --> 02:05:11,971
You don't need to wash an orange either.

1624
02:05:14,501 --> 02:05:18,972
One leg in the grave and you've
still got a sense of humour.

1625
02:05:50,334 --> 02:05:51,244
Sanj u...

1626
02:05:57,900 --> 02:05:58,878
Sanj u...

1627
02:06:03,234 --> 02:06:04,355
She is calling out to you...

1628
02:06:58,867 --> 02:06:59,470
Hello...

1629
02:07:00,100 --> 02:07:03,513
Did you go to sleep?

1630
02:07:06,367 --> 02:07:07,209
Who is this?

1631
02:07:07,834 --> 02:07:10,838
Did the wretch make any dinner?

1632
02:07:13,967 --> 02:07:15,810
Is she sitting with you?

1633
02:07:16,834 --> 02:07:17,778
Wretch?

1634
02:07:19,767 --> 02:07:21,178
I guess she didn't make dinner.

1635
02:07:22,067 --> 02:07:26,277
Ever since you married her,
you've been losing weight.

1636
02:07:26,901 --> 02:07:30,849
And that Punjabi woman
is growing fat like a buffalo!

1637
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:32,210
Who is this?

1638
02:07:32,267 --> 02:07:34,144
I'm your mom.

1639
02:07:34,967 --> 02:07:38,176
How many times will you ask?
Are you drunk?

1640
02:07:40,434 --> 02:07:41,105
Mom?

1641
02:07:41,767 --> 02:07:43,178
Yes, your mom.

1642
02:07:44,134 --> 02:07:51,450
I called you so many times but you'd
hang up saying you'll call back.

1643
02:07:52,734 --> 02:07:53,906
Don't hang up now.

1644
02:07:54,734 --> 02:07:55,940
I need to ask you something...

1645
02:07:57,001 --> 02:07:59,038
when are you taking your suitcase?

1646
02:08:00,201 --> 02:08:01,874
Which suitcase?

1647
02:08:03,367 --> 02:08:04,107
Mom?

1648
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:07,371
Suitcase...

1649
02:08:08,167 --> 02:08:10,943
The one you left here three months ago.

1650
02:08:12,367 --> 02:08:14,347
Wait...

1651
02:08:24,734 --> 02:08:26,975
Sanj u...

1652
02:08:27,834 --> 02:08:29,711
What's all that noise?

1653
02:08:30,367 --> 02:08:33,837
Say something... did someone die?

1654
02:08:36,134 --> 02:08:39,081
This is my last warning.

1655
02:08:39,701 --> 02:08:41,374
Come and take this suitcase or...

1656
02:08:41,734 --> 02:08:43,414
