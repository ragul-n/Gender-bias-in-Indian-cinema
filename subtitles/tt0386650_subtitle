1
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:00,249
Hey! stop.

2
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:55,256
You rogue!

3
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:56,925
You're an educated man,
aren't you?

4
00:05:57,634 --> 00:05:58,601
Don't you've any sense?

5
00:05:59,636 --> 00:06:01,263
lf you behave like this in your own
business place,

6
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:02,435
Who'll come to your shop?

7
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,109
Are you planning to close your
business & sit idle at home?

8
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,107
He's your friend, isn't he?

9
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:09,945
ls he involving himself in any
trouble like you?

10
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,439
He's only concerned about his work & home.
Why're you like this?

11
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:21,120
For considering you as my son
you're getting me a great name.

12
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,788
You came from your village saying
that you'll stand on your own.

13
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:27,622
But, you're behaving
like a rogue.

14
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:32,058
What happened, father?

15
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:33,966
Ask him.

16
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:37,140
He would've lifted his head high
if it was for a good cause.

17
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:38,975
What he did was wrong.

18
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:40,635
So, he has hung his head down.

19
00:06:42,512 --> 00:06:44,139
What did you do that made
father so angry?

20
00:06:45,182 --> 00:06:45,978
He won't tell.

21
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,150
He was fighting with some guys
in the coffee shop.

22
00:06:50,854 --> 00:06:52,754
Really!?

23
00:06:58,528 --> 00:07:00,826
lt's my duty to advice you.

24
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:02,760
Only you must advice your friend.

25
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:04,659
Father".

26
00:07:14,611 --> 00:07:17,910
Hey Goutham, stop.

27
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,686
Sorry.

28
00:07:24,054 --> 00:07:25,112
Did my father scold you?

29
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,356
Since it was you, he didn't
take the matter serious.

30
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:29,022
lf he had seen me there.

31
00:07:29,226 --> 00:07:31,524
He would've removed my name from
the family ration card.

32
00:07:33,063 --> 00:07:35,190
l've asked for forgiveness,
haven't I?

33
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:41,867
Why did they come to beat you?
- I & Maha went to a movie.

34
00:07:44,908 --> 00:07:46,034
I know you don't like that.

35
00:07:46,243 --> 00:07:48,211
But l'm helpless.
I had already committed.

36
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:51,039
Can everyone hate girls like you?

37
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:54,047
Tell me, why did they come
to beat you?

38
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:57,212
Didn't I tell you that I & Maha
went to a movie?

39
00:07:57,587 --> 00:07:58,713
The trouble started there only.

40
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:00,552
What to do?

41
00:08:00,757 --> 00:08:02,384
Atleast today, I wanted
to watch the movie.

42
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:06,060
They guy sitting behind was seriously
working out her from under the seat.

43
00:08:06,763 --> 00:08:09,231
It was my lover next to me.
He was alone.

44
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:13,566
I thought that I shouldn't be patient
anymore & smashed him.

45
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:15,397
He took my blows and
walked out silently.

46
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:17,239
After sometime, he came
with 4 others.

47
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:21,065
I didn't knew what to do.
So, I started to run.

48
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:23,742
I ran all the 3 kms., non stop.

49
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:27,575
Aren't ashamed for running?

50
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:30,749
You always tell me that you go
with her to beach & theatres.

51
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:32,088
Don't you've any other work?

52
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:34,583
ls there any better job other
than this at this age?

53
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:39,592
Keep talking like this. He's firing me
thinking that you're a gentleman.

54
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,929
Someday, you'll get caught
and will be in a soup.

55
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:53,075
Get me my wallet and
vehicle keys.

56
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:56,913
Maha, get your father
his vehicle keys.

57
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:58,907
l'm putting in dress.

58
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:01,914
Suresh, give his keys.
- Okay sister.

59
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:05,914
lt's time for the school bus.

60
00:09:06,122 --> 00:09:07,589
What are you doing here without
going to the stop?

61
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,520
When did he go early to
the bus stop?- Go.

62
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:11,921
He has time only to play
video games- Hey stop!

63
00:09:12,963 --> 00:09:13,429
Come here.

64
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,424
Tum back.

65
00:09:19,135 --> 00:09:20,432
Why do you need this
for school?

66
00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:21,937
Go.

67
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:29,441
Get me the lunch bag...
No, l'll take it myself.

68
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,947
Will you come with me,
l'll drop you in your office.

69
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:36,880
No need, father.

70
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,783
My friend will be waiting
for me at the bus stop.

71
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:39,614
You carry on.

72
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,617
Kamakshi, see you bye.
- Okay.

73
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:48,619
Come fast.
- l'm coming, mother.

74
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:54,360
Give me.- Have it.

75
00:09:55,071 --> 00:09:57,198
Eat on time.- See you, mother.

76
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:01,303
lt's coconut rice, eat on time
else, it'll get spoiled.- Okay.

77
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:29,495
Tell me.

78
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,177
So, what do you want me to do?

79
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:38,673
l'm a bachelor,
how about you?

80
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:42,017
l'm married, will you step aside?

81
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:50,519
Thank God! No one saw this.

82
00:10:54,898 --> 00:10:56,866
Yuck! He has upset me
early morning.

83
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,197
I want to smash his face.

84
00:11:08,812 --> 00:11:09,608
Are you playing fool?

85
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:10,713
l'm standing here for
so long time.

86
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:11,938
You're walking away
just like that.

87
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:14,378
Who asked you to stand here?
- Why?

88
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:17,212
lf my father sees you,
l'm finished.

89
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:21,049
Why? Will he ask for any hand loan?
- Do you think it's a joke?

90
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:24,056
l'll stand in that corner.
Go & get your bike fast.

91
00:11:24,928 --> 00:11:25,553
Okay madam.

92
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:40,739
He appears to be a fraud.

93
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:49,009
Once you went away, 5 men came.
- Oh My God! What happened then?

94
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:50,912
I tried to convince them but,
they didn't listen to me.

95
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:53,251
I thought that it's not good
to show mercy on them.

96
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:56,425
So, I beat them black & blue.
After that they started to beg for mercy.

97
00:11:57,293 --> 00:11:58,760
I felt pity & let them go.

98
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:02,757
You're getting angry at the drop of
the hat. Try to control it.

99
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:06,700
I too feel the same.
lt's in my blood.

100
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:08,262
l'll try.

101
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:10,935
You keep giving me some excuse
whenever I advise you.

102
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:19,040
Madam, am I asking
your property?

103
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:20,779
l'm only asking you to give me
Rs 5 more than the actual fare.

104
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:23,114
Why should I pay you Rs 5 more
than the actual fare?

105
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:25,287
You wanted to go to Shenoy nagar.
But, you've come to Anna nagar.

106
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:26,781
Can't you atleast tell her?

107
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:29,955
Why're you talking to her?

108
00:12:30,426 --> 00:12:31,950
I thought of not giving you
even the fare.

109
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:35,358
Why did you think so?
- You didn't drive the auto.

110
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:37,123
You ogled at my daughter
all the way.

111
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:39,131
Why are you accusing me?

112
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:40,131
Did I ogle you?

113
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:42,801
Look, she's saying that you did.

114
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:44,130
Get down! - Why?

115
00:12:45,174 --> 00:12:48,473
Get down, you go to
office by auto.

116
00:12:50,346 --> 00:12:52,814
Since I asked for Rs 5 more.

117
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:53,812
Are you both planning to
get me beaten up?

118
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,317
Keep this also with yourself.

119
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:56,815
Why're you throwing the money?

120
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,317
l'll consider that l've
given for charity.

121
00:12:58,521 --> 00:13:03,151
Look, lt's Kannan.
- Hey Kannan...Kannan.

122
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:05,422
l'm finished.

123
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:09,164
Why're you going so fast?
- l'm getting late to office.

124
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:12,163
So, do you have to go so fast?
lf something happens...

125
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:13,995
Nothing will happen, l'll go.

126
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:17,330
What kind of a boy you're?

127
00:13:17,874 --> 00:13:19,671
Even an auto driver is
ogling at my daughter.

128
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:22,674
You're going to marry her.
Won't you even look at her?

129
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,177
Keep quiet, mom.
He might get scared & run away.

130
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:31,110
It would've been better
if you had not seen me.

131
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:33,852
Okay, l'll leave.

132
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:39,687
Why is he like this?

133
00:13:40,063 --> 00:13:41,860
Don't know how you're going to
manage him after marriage?

134
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,845
Have you dropped her?

135
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:03,217
How can I? My aunt & Sandhya
saw me on the way.

136
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:05,213
Thank God!
I had a great escape.

137
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:06,888
Why're you doing this
shameless job?

138
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,558
You drop her in the morning &
pick her up in the evening.

139
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:11,552
Are you a point to point bus?

140
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:14,226
Look, we must do all this
when we fall in love.

141
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:16,895
lt's a waste to fall in love
if we don't do all this things.

142
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:23,337
We must go to the beach or a movie
once in a week.

143
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:29,908
Another important thing. lf she has a
phone at home, that's much better.

144
00:14:30,446 --> 00:14:33,142
Why there's phone kiosk everywhere?
lsn't it for this?

145
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:39,582
lf we keep talking & extending the call.
lt's a pleasant experience.

146
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:42,015
The only draw back is that
we've to shell out money.

147
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,757
Cell phone, SMS, E-mail, lnternet...

148
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:49,693
There latest technologies are being
developed only for people like us.

149
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:55,498
lt's a kind of penance.
You must experience it.

150
00:14:57,974 --> 00:15:02,604
But you!...you've taken away
pillion seat of your bike also.

151
00:15:03,313 --> 00:15:06,771
You can save petrol if you go by
walk, instead on bike.

152
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:11,116
In America it has been found that
trees & plants also fall in love.

153
00:15:11,654 --> 00:15:15,988
How come you're against love?
You're wasting your life.

154
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:17,218
Stop, you idiot!

155
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:19,621
You're doing rubbish things
in the name of love.

156
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:21,725
You were normal.

157
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:24,466
From where did this love
come all of a sudden?

158
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:34,401
When you go after a girl everyday
in a bus. You call it as love.

159
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:38,405
lf you go to beach or a movie with a girl.
You call that also as love.

160
00:15:41,184 --> 00:15:43,652
lf you keep looking at a
girl from a distance.

161
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:45,513
Do you also call it as love?

162
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:51,084
They don't even have the courage
to express their love.

163
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:55,088
They say that they're talking
through their eyes.

164
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:56,828
How silly!

165
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:59,001
You fall in love even when you hold
a girl from falling down.

166
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:00,661
Don't know what's this nasty thing?

167
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:02,231
Above all this,

168
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:07,165
When we're going on the road.
lf any girl asks for an address.

169
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:08,168
He's finished.

170
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:10,072
After that, he'll start searching
for her address.

171
00:16:11,714 --> 00:16:15,445
I can tolerate all these things.
But look there.

172
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:23,458
Wow! Look how nicely he's kneading her
like making a dough of flour.

173
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:26,854
They came 9o minutes
before you came.

174
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,360
Whether they talk or not. Their hands &
legs are talking for a long time.

175
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:35,264
lf you question why they are doing
like this in a public place.

176
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:38,700
They call themselves as true lovers
and would behave like that only.

177
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:45,378
Your E-mail, Internet has started from
chatting & progressed to dating.

178
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:48,046
Don't consider everyone to be like that.
Look at me.

179
00:16:49,252 --> 00:16:51,379
You!? You're a gentleman.

180
00:16:52,421 --> 00:16:53,888
You roam with a girl sitting
on your bike's pillion.

181
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:58,891
And ogle at girls on the road
by introducing yourself.

182
00:17:02,265 --> 00:17:06,827
Love must come out from heart
& not from your head.

183
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:11,900
Go & do your work.

184
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:16,642
I should've atleast done that
instead for talking to you.

185
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:21,181
We've to go for a night show,
come early.

186
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:22,311
Okay.

187
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:27,582
Don't you want coffee?- No need.
You both drink it together.

188
00:17:42,305 --> 00:17:44,535
Kannan, you take the blue and
l'll take the yellow.

189
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:52,876
Hey, Professor is coming.

190
00:18:13,503 --> 00:18:15,801
Hey, You look like an educated man.

191
00:18:16,005 --> 00:18:18,132
Shouldn't you go aside when a
student is smoking?

192
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:19,634
Why're you staring at me?

193
00:18:19,842 --> 00:18:24,370
Anyway you don't study at college, can't
you atleast respect your teachers?

194
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:27,475
I know that. The bell has rang.
Go to the class.

195
00:18:27,683 --> 00:18:29,480
How'll you come up in life?

196
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:32,821
You'll surely end up
as a waiter.

197
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,497
How come you're here?
- This is my restaurant.

198
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:43,832
ls it?- Yes.- Good.

199
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,258
Are you still with him?

200
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:50,934
You'll come up in life, see you.

201
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:52,174
Sir, you didn't have anything.

202
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,071
No need, my hunger got satiated
the moment I saw him.

203
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:59,014
What did you do now?
- I did nothing.

204
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:08,084
One torture just left,
another is on the way.

205
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:18,029
ls he here?

206
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:19,431
He came in the morning
and went away.

207
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,698
Will you give this file
to Shankaran?

208
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:30,045
Will you go & shall I give it?

209
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,445
No need, l'll give it.

210
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:40,719
Forget about what I told you.
Come home as usual okay?

211
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:41,882
Okay.

212
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,078
Why haven't you come home all these days?
- Are you too busy?

213
00:20:07,283 --> 00:20:10,252
You're seen very rarely at home?
Are you asking me?

214
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:16,155
Goutham has come, get some tea.

215
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:17,759
Then...

216
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:24,762
What is my brother-in-law saying?
He keeps on advising you, isn't he?

217
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:27,435
Nothing like that.
- You'll never give him up.

218
00:20:29,972 --> 00:20:31,371
Uncle, l'll take leave.

219
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:33,369
Wait, I have ordered tea for you,
haven't I?

220
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,437
What are you doing there?
Can't you hear me?

221
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:42,106
Your aunt can't hear properly.
- As if you can hear properly?

222
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:43,444
You never give up.

223
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:44,846
Why're you shouting like this?

224
00:20:45,988 --> 00:20:47,512
When did you come, Goutham?- Just now.

225
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:51,623
How long it has been since I told you
that he has come & ordered for tea.

226
00:20:51,827 --> 00:20:54,125
You come at your leisure and ask him
when did he come.

227
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,388
When did you tell me?

228
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:57,132
How will I hear if you
speak to yourself?

229
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,801
Am I mad to talk to myself?

230
00:21:01,337 --> 00:21:04,795
Has your uncle gone nuts?
- Why will you not talk like that?

231
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:07,369
I was adamant in marrying you,
a world beauty!

232
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:08,736
So you feel like that.

233
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:11,642
Why do you torture me the only
one day I stay at home?

234
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:15,476
Who?...Who's torturing you?
- Oh God! started fighting again!

235
00:21:15,684 --> 00:21:17,982
I don't want tea.
Will you stop fighting?

236
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:20,413
Aunty, go ahead with your work.

237
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,488
Don't act too smart
in front of him.- Go.

238
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:25,092
Looks like she'll beat him.

239
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,158
Come...Come.
Sit down...Sit down.

240
00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:34,332
Read. See you bye.

241
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:43,003
Don't say a word & get beaten up
after my departure?

242
00:21:51,721 --> 00:21:52,187
Come ....

243
00:21:58,227 --> 00:21:59,694
Come, I want to discuss
an important matter.

244
00:22:00,563 --> 00:22:01,359
What's the matter?

245
00:22:02,732 --> 00:22:03,858
Didn't I tell you it's
an important matter?

246
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:06,466
Whatever it is, tell it here only?
Don't spoil my work.

247
00:22:07,737 --> 00:22:09,705
He's Sudhakar, my colleague.

248
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:14,935
He loves a girl very sincerely.

249
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:16,611
She's going to get married
tomorrow with someone else.

250
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:18,006
You must kidnap that girl.

251
00:22:18,314 --> 00:22:20,111
lt's enough if you kidnap the girl.
We'll handle the rest.

252
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:30,621
l'll order for coffee.
Have it fast & leave the place.

253
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,288
What's this?
- Do I look like a henchman?

254
00:22:34,663 --> 00:22:36,290
Can't he kidnap her when
he can fall in love?

255
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:39,293
Does he need a henchman for that?
Standing here shamelessly.

256
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:43,301
Won't we do it if it's
possible for us?

257
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:49,638
Why did you bring me here?
- Keep quiet, l'll show you my lover.

258
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:51,642
He has come to you with
so much confidence.

259
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:53,474
Ask him to go there with
the same confidence.

260
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:56,818
What's going to happen by coming to me?
Am I running a police station?

261
00:22:58,187 --> 00:23:00,485
What's this? You're not
at all serious.

262
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:04,485
Do you know how sincerely I love her?
- I can't live without her.

263
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,657
Look, he's getting emotional.

264
00:23:08,197 --> 00:23:12,395
We can even trust girls who smile.
But never trust crying men.

265
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:14,662
lf he's not able to
solve this problem.

266
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,338
What's he going to do
after marriage?

267
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,169
Leave this as it is.
Let that girl live happily.

268
00:23:21,544 --> 00:23:23,739
Don't say that.
You're coming with me.

269
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:27,273
You don't worry l'll take care.

270
00:23:27,883 --> 00:23:30,078
Look, l've promised,
you're coming.

271
00:23:30,386 --> 00:23:31,614
Come.- Leave me.

272
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:33,347
Come.- Leave me.

273
00:23:33,556 --> 00:23:36,354
Come.- No, listen to me.

274
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:01,045
I was scared that you
might not come.

275
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,377
What're you talking? A good thing is
going to happen in your life.

276
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:04,382
How can we stay back?

277
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,720
You seem to have come early
& had a good feast.

278
00:24:08,924 --> 00:24:09,982
Come on, let me smell your hand.

279
00:24:11,093 --> 00:24:11,559
Sorry.

280
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:15,059
You both stay here.
You come with me.

281
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:16,731
We'll also come. The problem
might get complicated.

282
00:24:16,932 --> 00:24:20,060
He's asking us to stay here so that
the problem doesn't get complicated.

283
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:22,328
Can't you understand that?
- You go ahead.

284
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:23,666
Go...

285
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,909
He's going inside as a bachelor.
But will come out as couple.

286
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,236
Since how long are you in love?
- We must be lucky.

287
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:30,070
For the past 2 months.

288
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,246
Why're you so jealous?

289
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:37,278
Where?

290
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:50,155
What are you thinking about?

291
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,536
You must be polite.

292
00:25:02,745 --> 00:25:07,648
You must adjust with your In-laws.

293
00:25:08,584 --> 00:25:09,380
Whom do you want?

294
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:14,719
l'm asking you only.

295
00:25:14,924 --> 00:25:18,223
This is the bride's room.
Groom's room is upstairs.

296
00:25:18,594 --> 00:25:19,060
I know.

297
00:25:19,762 --> 00:25:20,729
Sudhakar has come.

298
00:25:21,263 --> 00:25:22,662
Who's Sudhakar?

299
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:25,233
Come.

300
00:25:27,603 --> 00:25:30,333
Hey Who're you? You're asking
the bride to come with you.

301
00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:32,001
Please one minute.

302
00:25:38,614 --> 00:25:39,581
Will you raise alarm?

303
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:43,417
Come.

304
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:49,815
Don't go, what am I to answer your
father if he asks me?.

305
00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:10,774
Where's your father?

306
00:26:12,982 --> 00:26:14,279
I asked you, where's your father?

307
00:26:16,318 --> 00:26:18,377
The groom's family will be
here by 5.3o am.

308
00:26:18,654 --> 00:26:20,952
The break fast must be ready
by 5.oo am, understood!

309
00:26:21,156 --> 00:26:24,125
Don't worry about that
sleep peacefully, we'll do it.

310
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,628
What's it dear? Haven't you
gone to bed yet?

311
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:31,530
Who're these people?

312
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,298
Are you her father?- Yes.

313
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:35,466
Yes! Why are you asking that?

314
00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:41,199
I want to talk to you.

315
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:43,971
What's all this?
- Don't know.

316
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:49,310
What have you bought?
- A night lamp.

317
00:26:52,354 --> 00:26:53,878
Oh! Started it again!

318
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,315
Come dear.

319
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:57,821
Sit.

320
00:26:58,694 --> 00:27:01,993
May you live long.
Don't stop, go ahead.

321
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:03,323
They don't have any other job.

322
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:04,757
What're you saying?

323
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:07,896
Tell your father he's asking,
isn't he?

324
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,997
Dear, what's it?

325
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:12,769
She's scared.
l'll tell you.

326
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:16,340
Do you know that your
daughter loves a man?

327
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:18,775
Can't you understand?

328
00:27:21,383 --> 00:27:21,849
Come.

329
00:27:23,218 --> 00:27:26,119
He is Sudhakar, working as
a sales executive.

330
00:27:28,057 --> 00:27:29,024
Come on.

331
00:27:32,728 --> 00:27:33,854
He's feeling shy.

332
00:27:36,231 --> 00:27:38,529
He's your son-in-law.

333
00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:43,864
He looks smart, doesn't he?
- What the hell is this?

334
00:27:44,073 --> 00:27:45,802
Wait, let me finish it.

335
00:27:46,074 --> 00:27:50,704
They are going to get married tomorrow.
So, I came to take the bride.

336
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:56,039
Anyway we're leaving, we should inform
her parents, shouldn't we?

337
00:27:57,086 --> 00:28:00,055
So ....
- Okay, we'll leave.

338
00:28:00,756 --> 00:28:02,223
Hey, are you playing
fool with me?

339
00:28:02,925 --> 00:28:04,392
Do you think you can walk away
from here so easily?

340
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,228
l'll break your neck
if you shout.

341
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,727
I respected you since you're
an elderly man.

342
00:28:14,103 --> 00:28:15,070
But you're shouting too much.

343
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:24,571
Sir .... Sir, please stop.

344
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,840
Take your hands off.
Are you going to convince me?

345
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,747
Whatever it is, talk to them?

346
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:39,526
You sinner! Having done everything
you're standing like an innocent.

347
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:48,933
Look, I don't know who you're.

348
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:51,773
By dawn it's my daughter's marriage.

349
00:28:52,641 --> 00:28:56,600
lf say now, is it fair to take away
my daughter all of a sudden?

350
00:28:57,145 --> 00:29:00,672
You don't have any problem.
You'll happily walk away with her.

351
00:29:01,316 --> 00:29:03,113
We'll have to commit suicide.

352
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:10,118
I don't care about that. I love Lakshmi
and I want her. That's all.

353
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:11,917
What kind of a person are you?

354
00:29:12,161 --> 00:29:15,562
You say that you love her. Couldn't you
tell it earlier?

355
00:29:15,998 --> 00:29:17,363
You kept quiet then.

356
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,130
After we invited people & made all
arrangements by taking a loan.

357
00:29:22,504 --> 00:29:26,235
You'll come with some henchmen &
take away the bride with you.

358
00:29:27,175 --> 00:29:29,803
Should the parents be disgraced?

359
00:29:30,512 --> 00:29:33,640
Except my father I never
fell at anyone's feet.

360
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:36,644
I don't know any way other than
this to save my honour.

361
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:44,657
Sir, I beg you. Please leave my daughter.
Sir, please listen to me.

362
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,589
Lakshmi, are you coming with
me or not?

363
00:29:47,196 --> 00:29:50,825
Sir...Sir, leave my daughter.

364
00:29:53,368 --> 00:29:53,993
One minute".

365
00:30:06,548 --> 00:30:11,508
An elderly man is begging you.
Don't you feel pity on him?

366
00:30:13,388 --> 00:30:16,755
You're in no way related to this family,
but you're taking his daughter away.

367
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:18,522
lsn't it, wrong?

368
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:24,763
You don't know me?

369
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:28,293
I was about to hit your father.
Didn't you feel like stopping me?

370
00:30:30,405 --> 00:30:32,373
Your father had brought you up
for 20 years.

371
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:36,032
He's begging your 2 month old lover
and you're simply watching that.

372
00:30:37,246 --> 00:30:40,443
You're not worried about anyone.
Only your love is important to you.

373
00:30:42,918 --> 00:30:44,215
ls it enough if you fall in love?

374
00:30:49,424 --> 00:30:56,728
Affection, patience & adjusting nature..
Only these are foundations of love.

375
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:00,060
You have none of these.

376
00:31:00,602 --> 00:31:04,129
Are you going to achieve some thing great
after your marriage?

377
00:31:06,108 --> 00:31:09,236
Even if you elope & get married
and give birth to a child.

378
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:12,747
And that child also will put you into
a similar situation.

379
00:31:13,615 --> 00:31:14,582
Don't forget that.

380
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,260
You're sacrificing your parents
for the sake of love.

381
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:32,923
For once...why don't you sacrifice your
love for the sake of your parents?

382
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:45,178
You think you can live happily
by leaving him in sorrows.

383
00:32:43,372 --> 00:32:46,773
Father, forgive me.

384
00:32:49,044 --> 00:32:54,448
I won't leave you...l won't.

385
00:32:56,385 --> 00:32:57,113
Don't cry.

386
00:33:06,394 --> 00:33:11,525
I had committed a mistake. Forgive me.
- Don't cry.

387
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:16,363
May you live happily!

388
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,275
Come, let's go.- Why are you
watching them crying?

389
00:33:38,093 --> 00:33:39,287
Forget it, sir.

390
00:33:39,761 --> 00:33:43,720
ls she the only girl in the world?
You'll get 1000's of such girls.

391
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:47,626
lf not, l'll find a beautiful girl
and get you married to her.

392
00:33:48,103 --> 00:33:49,730
Yuck! Girls always behave like this.

393
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:51,629
Once the father cried,
she ditched you.

394
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:56,577
Why only you both are coming?
What happened?

395
00:33:56,778 --> 00:34:00,407
What happened!?
- Everything got ruined.

396
00:34:01,783 --> 00:34:05,514
lfl had personally begged him he
would've married his daughter to me.

397
00:34:06,121 --> 00:34:08,316
I came to you since
you're my friend.

398
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,419
You asked to take him with me
since he's your friend.

399
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:17,588
Wow! He came & confused
everyone in a beautiful manner.

400
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:23,002
He advised the bride & made her
to go with her father.

401
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:30,009
He is not an ordinary person.
He's a cunning Sakuni in jeans.

402
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:36,276
I can never forget him all my life.

403
00:34:36,818 --> 00:34:39,343
You cunning Sakuni!
Yes, it's you.

404
00:34:39,988 --> 00:34:44,789
I curse you that you'll also fall
in love & feel for it.

405
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:49,558
Get lost.- What happened?
Tell me.

406
00:34:50,165 --> 00:34:53,623
Child reached safely her parents.
But, he's getting angry for that.

407
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:55,632
No, you've done some
mischief inside.

408
00:34:55,837 --> 00:34:56,963
Yes.- Why's he blabbering &
going away?

409
00:34:57,172 --> 00:34:59,640
I told you in the beginning itself
not to call me for such things.

410
00:35:00,008 --> 00:35:02,909
You affectionately called me
and I came. That's all.

411
00:35:03,511 --> 00:35:06,639
Tell me, is he important
to you, or me?

412
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:13,313
Why is he talking like this?
- Don't worry, l'll take care.

413
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:29,933
TAMILINI

414
00:35:30,105 --> 00:35:33,006
Oh Friend! don't get angry.

415
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:37,909
Don't keep yourself
away from love.

416
00:35:38,113 --> 00:35:41,014
Don't go away with mock-anger.

417
00:35:42,117 --> 00:35:45,917
You can never get back your youth.

418
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:53,926
lt'll add colours to eyes & enjoys.
Your heart will develop wings.

419
00:35:54,129 --> 00:35:57,929
It can bear the earth also.

420
00:35:58,133 --> 00:36:02,160
lt'll fly beyond the sky.

421
00:36:18,453 --> 00:36:57,558
TAMILINI

422
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:00,157
It was gifted to us
by Adam & Eve.

423
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,998
It has come to teach us love.

424
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:13,568
We can never live without
falling in love.

425
00:37:14,209 --> 00:37:17,838
lt'll pass current
through your soul.

426
00:37:18,213 --> 00:37:21,842
lt'll bum you alive in
a momentary lapse.

427
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:25,186
lt'll laugh at you turning
a man into a woman.

428
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:30,017
Love marriages are always a failure.

429
00:37:30,225 --> 00:37:37,791
Don't blame love for the mistake
committed by lovers.

430
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:46,038
lf you fall in love,
you'll start flying.

431
00:37:46,441 --> 00:38:29,710
TAMILINI

432
00:38:29,951 --> 00:38:32,249
Once you consume the
venom called love.

433
00:38:29,951 --> 00:38:32,249
There's no anti-venom
to save you.

434
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:45,763
There is nothing more
sorrowful than love.

435
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:53,571
lf not today, some day love
will conquer you.

436
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:57,278
You'll come to know that
love is not a venom.

437
00:38:57,479 --> 00:39:01,939
There's friendship also in this love,
understand it.

438
00:39:02,317 --> 00:39:05,286
Don't live in dreams.

439
00:39:06,154 --> 00:39:10,113
Don't raise love to an epic.

440
00:39:10,325 --> 00:39:13,294
A mirage can't quench your thirst.

441
00:39:14,162 --> 00:39:18,030
Never trust love.

442
00:39:40,655 --> 00:39:41,451
Useless fellow!

443
00:39:41,623 --> 00:39:44,319
They should talk instead of playing
the fool, shouldn't they?

444
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,297
Someone is playing the fool
early morning.

445
00:39:50,498 --> 00:39:51,556
Better keep the phone down.

446
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:56,804
How're you?

447
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:06,147
Who was that?
- Wrong number.

448
00:40:06,347 --> 00:40:07,575
I told you, didn't I?

449
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:21,595
You're expressing your love only on phone.
When're you going to tell him?

450
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:25,922
I can but he's a bit moody type.
l'm scared. He might shout at me.

451
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:28,102
He doesn't like girls at all.

452
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:30,430
Okay, you're not brave enough to
tell him on his face.

453
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:32,162
Does he know that it
was you on phone?

454
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:36,436
lf you don't act fast some other girl
might take him from under your nose.

455
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:38,441
Nothing will happen.
Come on sit.

456
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:41,114
You're always playful.
I don't lose anything.

457
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,809
What're you doing here?

458
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:50,791
Oh God! He'll rip off my skin!

459
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,729
Hey! l'm asking you only.

460
00:40:57,665 --> 00:41:00,634
A friend promised to come here.
l'm waiting for him.

461
00:41:01,936 --> 00:41:03,267
Has your friend promised to
come to the theatre?

462
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,406
No...no. His office is nearby,
so l'm here.

463
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:08,801
Okay come.
- Where?

464
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:10,807
To smoke.

465
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:12,980
Oh! No need. lt's getting
late for you. Go.

466
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:15,406
l'll give company till your
friend comes.

467
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,078
lt's alright you can go.

468
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:18,978
Stop here.

469
00:41:23,024 --> 00:41:24,651
ls this your friend?
- l'm caught.

470
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:27,487
Hey sorry. Don't say anything and
embarrass me.

471
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:28,354
Take it.

472
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:35,995
Never lags behind in courtesy.

473
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:37,663
Come.

474
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:43,006
We'll discuss the rest in the evening.
Take care.

475
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:45,675
You dog!

476
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:52,515
Sit in a seat, where no one is
sitting behind you.

477
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:54,184
Don't come to me for help.

478
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:08,194
What's it?

479
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:34,721
Goutham, your eyes are beautiful.

480
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:58,179
He won't see us.

481
00:43:17,972 --> 00:43:20,600
Did you make a vow to God to push
your vehicle in hot sun?

482
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:23,333
How does it look like to you?
My vehicle had a flat tyre.

483
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:25,439
lf your vehicle had a flat tyre,
go to the work shop.

484
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:26,442
Why did you come here?

485
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:29,282
Don't I know that?
- Then, why did you come here?

486
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:33,548
lt's getting late for my practical.
Now the time is 10 am.

487
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:36,619
And you're torturing me with questions.
l'm already tensed.

488
00:43:36,824 --> 00:43:38,553
Hey, why do you get angry?
What should I do now?

489
00:43:39,327 --> 00:43:40,555
You must drop me.

490
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:49,470
How can we go on this vehicle?

491
00:43:51,005 --> 00:43:51,471
Have it.

492
00:43:52,173 --> 00:43:53,800
She might've wantonly
deflated the tyre.

493
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:54,641
Come.

494
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:07,009
Where is your favourite coolers
which you always sport?

495
00:44:08,423 --> 00:44:09,219
I lost it.

496
00:44:09,423 --> 00:44:11,050
It wouldn't have got lost.

497
00:44:11,259 --> 00:44:13,989
May be some one who loves you
would've taken it.

498
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:15,558
Can you keep quiet?

499
00:44:16,097 --> 00:44:17,121
Hey, stop...

500
00:44:17,932 --> 00:44:20,059
ls it the first time on a bike?

501
00:44:21,269 --> 00:44:23,134
Hug your lover tightly.

502
00:44:23,605 --> 00:44:25,573
Buddy, won't you teach her
all such things?

503
00:44:32,447 --> 00:44:36,008
They're teasing you,
why're you keeping quiet?

504
00:44:36,284 --> 00:44:37,751
You should've beat them
black & blue.

505
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,750
Get down...get down...

506
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,428
I can't fight for a woman.
You go by auto safely.

507
00:44:58,139 --> 00:44:59,936
Then, who else will he fight for?

508
00:45:17,492 --> 00:45:19,119
What's it?
- lt's a business place.

509
00:45:19,327 --> 00:45:20,453
Would you mind dancing over there?
- Get lost.

510
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:22,128
Hey stop...
- Please listen to me.

511
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:25,197
Okay we won't dance.- Please listen
to me. We'll go there & dance.

512
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,799
You dance here".
dance...dance...

513
00:45:33,007 --> 00:45:35,134
He's requesting you, isn't it?
Please go there & dance.

514
00:45:35,343 --> 00:45:37,311
Look, a new chap has come.

515
00:45:37,845 --> 00:45:38,743
Who're you?

516
00:45:39,347 --> 00:45:42,748
Dance...l asked you to dance ....
Dance...Dance.

517
00:45:47,088 --> 00:46:08,239
TAMILINI

518
00:46:08,409 --> 00:46:18,375
Do you know, whether mighty or meek,
death is a great leveller?

519
00:46:19,086 --> 00:46:21,384
You brought nothing while coming
to this earth.

520
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:28,722
And you take nothing while leaving it.
Do you know the facts of life?

521
00:46:29,597 --> 00:46:34,728
Life is not a personal property.

522
00:46:34,936 --> 00:46:39,896
People come & people go. Neither
the past nor the future stays here.

523
00:46:40,274 --> 00:46:45,473
Neither you nor me are immortal.

524
00:47:06,534 --> 00:47:17,342
TAMILINI

525
00:47:17,645 --> 00:47:22,776
We blindly go in search of luxurious life.

526
00:47:22,984 --> 00:47:28,115
We're piling up the sins.

527
00:47:28,322 --> 00:47:33,453
Though we're in the form of humans,
we behave like animals.

528
00:47:33,661 --> 00:47:38,792
We forget about God's judgements
& keep committing crimes.

529
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,131
The lost time will never come back.
Don't lose your vision.

530
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:49,742
lf an earth quake occurs,
everything will be in chaos.

531
00:48:10,731 --> 00:48:34,886
TAMILINI

532
00:48:35,055 --> 00:48:45,192
Things that we learn in the womb
are continued in the cradle also.

533
00:48:45,733 --> 00:48:50,864
When we attain our youth,
we struggle to fall in love.

534
00:48:51,072 --> 00:48:56,203
Once we fall in love,
we dance in stupor of liquor.

535
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:01,541
We dance for name & fame.
We dance for money.

536
00:49:01,749 --> 00:49:06,948
When we die, the entire city dances.

537
00:49:54,101 --> 00:50:12,976
TAMILINI

538
00:50:17,491 --> 00:50:20,949
Look, Selvam left early morning
on an urgent work.

539
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:24,028
There is no one to look after the
restaurant. Where are you taking me to?

540
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,298
l'm asking you.
- Why are you looking at the ceiling?

541
00:50:29,003 --> 00:50:31,471
You've come so far.
Come with me, l'll tell you.

542
00:50:32,173 --> 00:50:34,334
Okay, where did Selvam go?

543
00:50:34,575 --> 00:50:37,339
He said that it's an urgent work.
- I see.

544
00:50:40,848 --> 00:50:42,543
When I questioned him,
he blame on him.

545
00:50:55,196 --> 00:50:56,322
What're you looking at? come.

546
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:00,734
Why did you bring me here?

547
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:03,232
Today is Maha's birthday
she is giving a party.

548
00:51:03,437 --> 00:51:05,405
Will the party be interesting
without you?

549
00:51:05,606 --> 00:51:08,404
As if this is very important for me.
Keep these things with you.

550
00:51:08,609 --> 00:51:10,907
What're you talking?
She might feel bad.

551
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:12,237
She is one of us.

552
00:51:12,446 --> 00:51:15,904
lt's your view & not mine.
l'll make a move.

553
00:51:16,884 --> 00:51:17,680
Leave me.

554
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:25,751
l'll nip your neck when you come there.

555
00:51:34,969 --> 00:51:38,166
I knew that he'll create
problems if he comes.

556
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:39,939
You never listened to me.

557
00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:44,937
How inhuman is he?
- Who's inhuman?

558
00:51:45,312 --> 00:51:46,779
I know you, only for
the past 4 years.

559
00:51:47,148 --> 00:51:48,615
We're friends for the
past 20 years.

560
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,948
lf we've any misunderstanding,
you'll marry someone else.

561
00:51:54,655 --> 00:51:55,383
But he's not like that.

562
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:57,718
Whatever may happen, he'll come searching
for me the next morning.

563
00:51:59,994 --> 00:52:03,521
He's short tempered, that's all.
Why're you making a mess of it?

564
00:52:04,331 --> 00:52:05,628
Never ever talk about him.

565
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:16,635
Take it.

566
00:52:32,092 --> 00:52:33,719
Should l've to tell you individually?
Drink.

567
00:52:34,261 --> 00:52:36,058
The way you behaved wasn't good.

568
00:52:36,263 --> 00:52:37,730
Leave it, it's not the first time.

569
00:52:37,931 --> 00:52:40,559
Don't you know about him. Someday he'll
change his heart, won't he?

570
00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:41,234
l'll hit you.

571
00:52:41,435 --> 00:52:43,232
Why're you hitting him now?

572
00:52:44,104 --> 00:52:45,230
What do you think of yourself?

573
00:52:47,274 --> 00:52:50,072
He says that l'll change my heart?
Am I so fickled?

574
00:52:50,778 --> 00:52:52,245
Are you both going to reform me?

575
00:52:54,448 --> 00:52:56,177
It seems l've disgraced him
before his lover.

576
00:52:56,784 --> 00:52:58,752
Useless!

577
00:52:58,952 --> 00:53:00,078
Don't be stupid..

578
00:53:00,454 --> 00:53:02,081
l'm asking you, why're you behaving
like this with everyone.

579
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:03,984
But you're talking irrelevantly.

580
00:53:05,126 --> 00:53:07,594
Who's talking irrelevantly?
ls it me or you.

581
00:53:08,129 --> 00:53:10,324
You brought some specty.
& asked me to conduct his marriage.

582
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:12,766
You took me to Maha's
birthday party.

583
00:53:13,133 --> 00:53:14,327
Did I come willingly?

584
00:53:15,302 --> 00:53:19,261
You took me with you & when something
happened, you kept complaining about it.

585
00:53:21,142 --> 00:53:23,667
Okay, don't fight unnecessarily
& waste time, drink fast.

586
00:53:24,478 --> 00:53:27,208
While we're talking about something,
what're you thinking about?

587
00:53:29,316 --> 00:53:30,340
Yes, I took you there.

588
00:53:31,151 --> 00:53:33,278
Does that mean that you can
cause trouble?

589
00:53:33,987 --> 00:53:37,684
lf You keep talking like this to everyone,
someday, you'll be shunned.

590
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:40,456
Look, he's cursing me.

591
00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:46,459
Let me be shunned.
You live in a joint family.

592
00:53:47,167 --> 00:53:49,965
Even when you're normal, we can't talk
to you. Now you're boozed up.

593
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:51,364
Will any human talk to you now?

594
00:53:53,007 --> 00:53:56,636
Kanna, stop. Where're you going?
- Somewhere".

595
00:53:56,843 --> 00:53:57,969
Go...Go...

596
00:53:58,345 --> 00:53:59,812
Wherever you might go
you'll have come to me.

597
00:54:00,514 --> 00:54:02,141
No shortage of pride

598
00:54:04,852 --> 00:54:06,046
Where're you going?

599
00:54:06,687 --> 00:54:10,248
What?- We can have another peg..

600
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:13,986
It was a trifle, he made it big.

601
00:54:14,194 --> 00:54:15,661
And stopped me from drinking.

602
00:54:34,214 --> 00:54:35,841
Where were you?

603
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:40,845
Look at him.

604
00:54:42,222 --> 00:54:46,352
It seems you won't be satisfied
unless you're insulted once a month.

605
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,085
Keep quiet.
You keep finding faults in him.

606
00:54:58,572 --> 00:55:01,632
He's coming. Don't create trouble
by provoking him.

607
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,396
When did you come?

608
00:55:28,268 --> 00:55:30,793
Atleast now, your son has the courtesy
to ask.

609
00:55:32,273 --> 00:55:34,241
You behave in the way
he has been saying.

610
00:55:36,276 --> 00:55:39,006
lf I talk to him pleasantly he'll
talk about my marriage.

611
00:55:39,279 --> 00:55:40,405
You've come here for that only,
haven't you?

612
00:55:40,614 --> 00:55:43,811
Are you going to become
a saint with out marrying?

613
00:55:44,952 --> 00:55:48,752
Look mom, l'll inform you
when I want to marry.

614
00:55:48,956 --> 00:55:51,424
Till then, don't talk about it.
This is for you also.

615
00:55:54,161 --> 00:55:58,222
She'll definitely lose.
l'll get Rs 500 today.

616
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:00,229
Don't be so greedy.
- Look there.

617
00:56:00,401 --> 00:56:04,098
She confuses us every time.- She's always
like this.- You're right.

618
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:08,530
She's fit for nothing.
- She's coming.

619
00:56:08,709 --> 00:56:10,301
Give it to me.
- Look there.

620
00:56:12,512 --> 00:56:14,810
He's trying to show off.

621
00:56:15,015 --> 00:56:16,539
Give it to me, l'll go.

622
00:56:17,684 --> 00:56:19,549
Be careful,
he may fall for you.

623
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:25,417
Tell me.- Can you please tell me
where this place is?

624
00:56:28,362 --> 00:56:31,160
Oh! this one... Come with me.
l'll drop you there.

625
00:56:31,365 --> 00:56:32,332
You're finished.

626
00:56:32,532 --> 00:56:35,160
lt's okay, you may've some work.
Just guide me.

627
00:56:35,369 --> 00:56:38,497
l've no work other than this.
Come, get on the vehicle.

628
00:56:38,705 --> 00:56:39,831
l'll go myself.

629
00:56:40,207 --> 00:56:42,004
The days aren't good &
you say you'll go all alone?

630
00:56:42,209 --> 00:56:45,337
Come got on the vehicle.
- No l'll go myself give it to me.

631
00:56:45,545 --> 00:56:48,173
He's not leaving me.
He seems to be a perfect ogler.

632
00:56:48,382 --> 00:56:49,349
Listen to me, madam.

633
00:56:51,051 --> 00:56:51,915
Take it out...

634
00:56:54,388 --> 00:56:55,855
Don't I know about these guys?

635
00:56:57,224 --> 00:57:00,682
You've won. What's the treat?
- We'll have beer.

636
00:57:01,729 --> 00:57:02,787
You're finished.

637
00:57:04,898 --> 00:57:09,198
lf you trap the person whom I point out
to you, you'll get Rs 500 more.

638
00:57:09,403 --> 00:57:10,802
Tell me, who's that?

639
00:57:11,071 --> 00:57:15,531
A man wearing blue shirt with beard...
- Give it to me, l'll try.

640
00:57:20,247 --> 00:57:21,373
Let me hide.

641
00:57:23,917 --> 00:57:25,384
Can you tell me where
this place is?

642
00:57:36,096 --> 00:57:37,563
You rascal, don't tell...

643
00:57:38,098 --> 00:57:41,966
Go straight, take 2nd left
& keep going.

644
00:57:42,269 --> 00:57:43,964
You'll find Chandra Hospital
on the right hand side.

645
00:57:44,771 --> 00:57:47,399
There is a police station,
10 buildings after that.

646
00:57:47,608 --> 00:57:50,634
Go & ask there. They'll take you.
Move away.

647
00:57:51,945 --> 00:57:53,310
Superb!

648
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,246
A friend of your's came for our marriage.
Where she?

649
00:58:01,455 --> 00:58:02,422
I haven't seen her for a long time.

650
00:58:02,622 --> 00:58:03,589
Do you want to see her?

651
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:07,089
She was the only beautiful girl
amongst the crowd. - Yuck!

652
00:58:27,381 --> 00:58:29,178
Newly married?
- Yes, sir.

653
00:58:36,823 --> 00:58:37,949
Silk shirt?- Yes.

654
00:58:40,994 --> 00:58:42,461
Did you get these from
your father-in-law?

655
00:58:44,164 --> 00:58:46,792
Why're you holding
her so tightly?

656
00:58:47,501 --> 00:58:48,468
Are you afraid that she
might run away?

657
00:58:50,837 --> 00:58:53,305
It seems you'll finish everything
on the road instead of home.

658
00:58:53,507 --> 00:58:54,974
Then, what'll you do at home?

659
00:58:57,177 --> 00:58:57,643
What's it?

660
00:58:58,845 --> 00:59:01,245
Whether it's on road, on bike,
in bus, or in a theatre,

661
00:59:01,848 --> 00:59:03,907
I can't tolerate your
mischievous acts.

662
00:59:06,854 --> 00:59:07,821
Shouldn't you be sensible atleast?

663
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:10,148
She's my wife.
How can you scold her?

664
00:59:11,858 --> 00:59:13,985
I know. Did I claim her as my wife?

665
00:59:14,528 --> 00:59:16,928
Take your hands off.

666
00:59:22,202 --> 00:59:23,829
Go...Go...

667
00:59:27,207 --> 00:59:29,607
You must maintain this distance
till you reach home.

668
00:59:30,377 --> 00:59:30,843
Go.

669
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,176
Go man.

670
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,017
This is also nice.

671
00:59:47,727 --> 00:59:52,027
Has your vehicle got punctured again?
He's not here. He's gone out.

672
00:59:52,399 --> 00:59:54,196
I came to see you.
- me?

673
00:59:55,402 --> 00:59:58,530
l've a doubt.
- What's it?

674
00:59:59,072 --> 01:00:02,041
Did Goutham had failure in love?
- Why're you asking that?

675
01:00:02,242 --> 01:00:06,042
Because he doesn't like girls.

676
01:00:06,246 --> 01:00:10,376
He's not crazy about girls
from the beginning.

677
01:00:10,584 --> 01:00:13,712
Do you know, he stands aside when
we ogle at girls in college.

678
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,549
Just for this reason,
a girl was chasing him for 2 years.

679
01:00:18,091 --> 01:00:19,388
He never fell in her trap.

680
01:00:19,593 --> 01:00:21,561
So Goutham hates love, isn't it?

681
01:00:21,762 --> 01:00:25,220
He is not against love.
He'll agree if it is true love.

682
01:00:26,266 --> 01:00:28,791
But why're you asking about all this?

683
01:00:34,441 --> 01:00:35,066
Just like that.

684
01:01:25,659 --> 01:01:27,126
I shouldn't have spoken
like that.

685
01:01:29,829 --> 01:01:31,956
Hereafter I won't talk like that
about you & your lover.

686
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:34,458
It was my mistake.

687
01:01:35,836 --> 01:01:37,133
Shall I ask for forgiveness
from everyone.

688
01:01:37,337 --> 01:01:38,065
Sir, come here.

689
01:01:38,672 --> 01:01:40,299
Ramkumar, you can go.

690
01:01:41,508 --> 01:01:42,634
Why are you disgracing me?

691
01:01:44,344 --> 01:01:45,470
Do you've to beg my pardon?

692
01:01:47,681 --> 01:01:51,082
I feel hurt when others talk bad
about you. Why don't you understand?

693
01:01:51,351 --> 01:01:53,876
Why do you worry when l'm not?

694
01:01:54,688 --> 01:01:56,883
Take half a day leave.
We'll go out.

695
01:01:58,358 --> 01:02:01,486
I had already applied for leave.
- Then what're you thinking about?

696
01:02:02,195 --> 01:02:06,894
She was already upset.
I too shouted at her.

697
01:02:07,534 --> 01:02:09,229
So, I want to see Maha.

698
01:02:11,371 --> 01:02:12,668
I won't go if you disapprove.

699
01:02:19,946 --> 01:02:21,038
Get lost.

700
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:44,498
lt's my bad luck that
l've to be with you.

701
01:02:50,577 --> 01:02:51,771
lt's nice.

702
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,707
I was searching for you in your office
and you're sitting here!

703
01:02:55,248 --> 01:02:56,875
Do you want me to wander around?

704
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,785
What happened?
Why're you like this?

705
01:03:04,257 --> 01:03:05,053
l'm asking you.

706
01:03:05,759 --> 01:03:07,124
l'm very scared.

707
01:03:08,261 --> 01:03:08,784
Why?

708
01:03:10,931 --> 01:03:12,899
What did you say in the restaurant?

709
01:03:15,435 --> 01:03:15,992
What did I say?

710
01:03:16,937 --> 01:03:24,002
You said that l'll marry someone
if we have some misunderstanding.

711
01:03:24,444 --> 01:03:27,140
But l'm scared that you'll leave me.

712
01:03:27,614 --> 01:03:28,137
me?

713
01:03:28,615 --> 01:03:31,140
I said that because I was tensed.
How can you take that so seriously?

714
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:32,747
But I didn't mean that.

715
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:36,680
My family members trust me very much.

716
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:40,817
lf my father comes to know about this.
I don't know what he'll do.

717
01:03:41,461 --> 01:03:46,160
l'm afraid whether we'll be able to get
married crossing all these hurdles.

718
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,600
I don't know about your parents.
But my father never goes against my wish.

719
01:03:50,804 --> 01:03:53,102
lf I take you to my house,
introduce you as my fiance,

720
01:03:53,306 --> 01:03:55,831
My father will consider you as
his daughter-in-law & bless you.

721
01:03:56,143 --> 01:03:57,940
We're very close.

722
01:03:58,311 --> 01:04:01,280
How could you get angry without
understanding this?- Keep quiet.

723
01:04:01,481 --> 01:04:03,506
Anyway you're going to reveal
our love to your father.

724
01:04:04,551 --> 01:04:06,781
Why don't you reveal
it tomorrow itself?

725
01:04:09,322 --> 01:04:10,186
Tomorrow!

726
01:04:11,992 --> 01:04:12,617
l'll tell him.

727
01:04:13,993 --> 01:04:16,962
Father, I love Mahalakshmi.

728
01:04:17,497 --> 01:04:20,295
I want to marry her..
...With your permission.

729
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,626
l'll beat you with slippers.

730
01:04:39,686 --> 01:04:41,813
You spoke so bravely to her.

731
01:04:42,689 --> 01:04:43,656
Express it...

732
01:04:48,361 --> 01:04:50,989
I would've told him
if I could.But I couldn't.

733
01:04:51,364 --> 01:04:54,822
Sir...Sir...
- What's it? Tell me.

734
01:04:55,034 --> 01:04:57,662
Your uncle & aunt have come.
Your father is waiting for you.

735
01:04:58,037 --> 01:05:01,495
What are you going to ask him?
Let us finalize it.

736
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:04,236
Whatever it is, shouldn't we
ask for his approval?

737
01:05:04,544 --> 01:05:06,171
Will he deny?

738
01:05:07,047 --> 01:05:09,447
Here he comes.
Ask him if you want?

739
01:05:14,721 --> 01:05:18,020
We've decided to perform your marriage.

740
01:05:18,558 --> 01:05:19,183
What?

741
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:21,584
You with Sandhya.
Aren't you happy?

742
01:05:23,396 --> 01:05:24,124
Excuse me.

743
01:05:26,066 --> 01:05:27,363
He generally feels shy.

744
01:05:27,567 --> 01:05:29,194
And this is about his marriage,
he'll definitely feel shy.

745
01:05:31,404 --> 01:05:34,703
They've strangled my love & ....

746
01:05:37,744 --> 01:05:41,805
This concerns your life,
think well.

747
01:05:44,251 --> 01:05:45,047
I must tell them.

748
01:05:46,419 --> 01:05:47,477
I must tell them everything.

749
01:05:49,422 --> 01:05:53,381
lf my sister-in-law was alive,
it would've been nice.

750
01:05:54,094 --> 01:05:56,494
Where did you go when elders
are talking to you.

751
01:05:58,765 --> 01:06:00,960
You fix the date.

752
01:06:03,102 --> 01:06:06,071
Are you waiting for his approval?

753
01:06:06,939 --> 01:06:08,065
Do you agree?

754
01:06:10,443 --> 01:06:13,310
He won't go against my wish.
Why're you worried?

755
01:06:13,613 --> 01:06:15,638
He has given his approval.
Let's fix the date.

756
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:43,005
You seem to be very dejected.

757
01:06:44,143 --> 01:06:44,939
Any problem?

758
01:06:46,146 --> 01:06:48,876
I knew it from the way
you're standing.

759
01:06:50,149 --> 01:06:52,617
Tell me do I have to conduct
marriage for anyone?

760
01:06:52,819 --> 01:06:54,548
No. You must stop the marriage.

761
01:06:56,823 --> 01:06:57,619
What're you saying?

762
01:06:57,824 --> 01:06:59,689
They've fixed the alliance
for me with Sandhya.

763
01:06:59,993 --> 01:07:01,893
Really! What a good news.

764
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:10,799
Don't play with me.
l'm totally shattered.

765
01:07:11,504 --> 01:07:13,301
Somehow, stop this marriage.

766
01:07:14,841 --> 01:07:16,638
You're a legend in these matters.

767
01:07:19,512 --> 01:07:22,379
How'll I do that for you?
- Consider my position.

768
01:07:22,849 --> 01:07:24,817
lf you talk to my father,
everything will be solved.

769
01:07:25,852 --> 01:07:26,318
What?

770
01:07:27,353 --> 01:07:27,819
Go.

771
01:07:30,523 --> 01:07:32,491
As if they're discussing
the issue of river Kaveri.

772
01:07:32,692 --> 01:07:35,490
What did you say?
He generally doesn't like me.

773
01:07:35,862 --> 01:07:38,490
lf I do this, I won't even
be able to step in your house.

774
01:07:41,868 --> 01:07:44,598
Whatever he does is only for your good.
marry Sandhya.

775
01:07:46,206 --> 01:07:48,401
l'll marry only Maha.
Can you help me or not?

776
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:00,610
I feel pity for you but...

777
01:08:02,222 --> 01:08:02,950
I can't.

778
01:08:21,074 --> 01:08:22,541
Come here
- What's it?

779
01:08:25,578 --> 01:08:26,545
What's this?

780
01:08:28,748 --> 01:08:29,772
Don't you know English?

781
01:08:31,251 --> 01:08:33,219
I know, but what do
you mean by that.

782
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,387
It means love is dangerous.

783
01:08:35,755 --> 01:08:36,779
Who said that?

784
01:08:38,258 --> 01:08:40,385
Only people who failed in love say that.

785
01:08:40,593 --> 01:08:43,653
Did we learn cycling
without falling down?

786
01:08:44,597 --> 01:08:47,566
Or did we get educated without being
canned by teachers?

787
01:08:49,268 --> 01:08:52,396
Only failure is a stepping
stone to success.

788
01:08:52,939 --> 01:08:54,463
You didn't understand this.

789
01:08:54,774 --> 01:08:57,902
We don't get loan
without toiling hard.

790
01:08:58,111 --> 01:08:59,408
Then how'll you fall in love?

791
01:08:59,946 --> 01:09:02,005
You'll scribble non-sense,
if you find space in auto.

792
01:09:02,281 --> 01:09:03,407
Why're you still standing? Go.

793
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:05,918
Though he's lean,
listen to his advise.

794
01:09:10,623 --> 01:09:12,591
Superb! How're you able to
give such lectures?

795
01:09:12,792 --> 01:09:16,319
Leave that, but don't tell this
to Goutham. Lift it.

796
01:09:35,648 --> 01:09:38,515
What the hell did you drink?
You stink.

797
01:09:41,321 --> 01:09:43,846
He's sitting like an innocent person.

798
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:52,127
Don't vomit.

799
01:10:08,348 --> 01:10:10,407
What's it?
- Don't you know the reason?

800
01:10:10,683 --> 01:10:14,312
That specty. was right.
You're a fox in a pair ofjeans.

801
01:10:14,521 --> 01:10:15,488
lt's true.

802
01:10:19,692 --> 01:10:22,559
Why're you walking away
when l'm talking to you?

803
01:10:24,197 --> 01:10:26,665
He doesn't even care about me.

804
01:10:34,874 --> 01:10:36,341
Listen me & don't get angry.

805
01:10:37,376 --> 01:10:39,241
lf we allow this to continue,
the matter will become serious.

806
01:10:39,712 --> 01:10:41,680
What do you want me to do?
- It is...

807
01:10:42,882 --> 01:10:44,440
He says that he loves Maha.

808
01:10:45,051 --> 01:10:46,916
But he goes behind any girl
he sees on the road.

809
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,587
How can I trust him?
- He's doing it for fun.

810
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:52,687
But I know that he truly
loves that girl.

811
01:10:55,227 --> 01:10:56,524
He'll die if he doesn't get her.

812
01:11:05,905 --> 01:11:07,463
Whoelse is there for him?

813
01:11:23,256 --> 01:11:24,052
Get me a cigarette.

814
01:11:26,593 --> 01:11:28,060
Welcome. What do you want sir?

815
01:11:29,095 --> 01:11:33,054
A cigarette to treat my cold &
Pan Parag to cure my stomach pain.

816
01:11:33,933 --> 01:11:36,060
Looks like a bandicoot.
Look at his taunting.

817
01:11:39,438 --> 01:11:42,236
Shit! Not good.

818
01:11:43,943 --> 01:11:46,241
What else?
- What else could I ask for?

819
01:11:46,446 --> 01:11:50,075
Your love forever, & now Rs 100 as loan.
That's enough.

820
01:11:53,086 --> 01:11:54,951
Got scared!
Okay, take it.

821
01:11:57,323 --> 01:11:59,723
You brainless! How can you keep the
bottles in such places?

822
01:11:59,926 --> 01:12:03,487
You brute! useless! idiot...

823
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:05,622
What's the matter?

824
01:12:05,931 --> 01:12:07,228
ls this wastrel your friend?

825
01:12:07,433 --> 01:12:10,698
Take care of him.
He might get runover by some vehicle.

826
01:12:13,973 --> 01:12:14,837
Don't leave me.

827
01:12:32,592 --> 01:12:36,050
What happened to you?
You've come all of a sudden.

828
01:12:36,329 --> 01:12:37,591
I want to talk to you in private.

829
01:12:38,297 --> 01:12:42,358
In private? Why not?
Come on, sit.

830
01:13:04,657 --> 01:13:08,718
Okay, l'll make a move.
Think well & tell me later.

831
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:15,528
Wait.

832
01:13:19,438 --> 01:13:20,769
Kannan is not what you think he is.

833
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,734
What do you mean?

834
01:13:24,176 --> 01:13:27,168
He is in love with a girl.
- ls he in love?

835
01:13:27,546 --> 01:13:29,138
Does he know to do all such things?

836
01:13:29,415 --> 01:13:32,407
He is going to marry her only.
- Let him carry on.

837
01:13:33,019 --> 01:13:34,714
This is not a matter for you
to be funny.

838
01:13:36,856 --> 01:13:39,518
Your parents have decided
to get you both married.

839
01:13:40,659 --> 01:13:43,355
Don't you know that?
- I swear, I don't know.

840
01:13:43,796 --> 01:13:48,460
But I never thought
of marrying Kannan.

841
01:13:48,734 --> 01:13:51,999
l'll marry only a person like you.

842
01:13:52,338 --> 01:13:53,862
Better you know this.

843
01:14:26,406 --> 01:14:29,239
How can you sleep peacefully
by putting me in a quandary?

844
01:14:33,512 --> 01:14:34,740
Why did you kick me?

845
01:14:35,148 --> 01:14:35,842
Useless!

846
01:14:36,148 --> 01:14:37,672
Just now I met your aunt's daughter.

847
01:14:38,417 --> 01:14:40,408
Why did you meet Sandhya?

848
01:14:42,889 --> 01:14:45,722
Hey! You're clever.

849
01:14:46,959 --> 01:14:50,451
You must've changed her heart
by telling her something.

850
01:14:50,663 --> 01:14:51,789
There was nothing left for me, to change.

851
01:14:52,398 --> 01:14:55,367
Even she's not in interested in this
marriage.- Even she? But why?

852
01:14:55,968 --> 01:14:58,436
She is also in love.
- With whom?

853
01:15:03,175 --> 01:15:03,834
I don't know.

854
01:15:04,277 --> 01:15:05,335
Let him be anyone.

855
01:15:05,678 --> 01:15:08,272
One problem is solved.
Only my father is left.

856
01:15:08,915 --> 01:15:12,078
Your problem is solved
but mine has only started now.

857
01:15:12,885 --> 01:15:14,512
There is a saying that
"A friend in need is friend indeed".

858
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:18,622
You've proved it right.
Thank you. See you.

859
01:15:19,225 --> 01:15:22,456
l've fallen into a trap
by helping him.

860
01:15:22,728 --> 01:15:25,094
Did you call me?
- Get lost, l'll kick you.

861
01:15:22,728 --> 01:15:23,717
You didn't call me?

862
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:31,030
We've eloped from our village
courageously.

863
01:15:31,337 --> 01:15:34,704
What're we going to do now?
- Don't keep worrying.

864
01:15:35,007 --> 01:15:38,875
l'm also scared.
But, am I showing it like you?

865
01:15:39,612 --> 01:15:42,979
Look, there'll be a way out for us.

866
01:15:43,315 --> 01:15:44,373
Eat.

867
01:15:54,693 --> 01:15:56,183
Have you eloped from your village?

868
01:15:58,030 --> 01:15:59,725
Which place?

869
01:16:00,132 --> 01:16:01,326
l've a friend.

870
01:16:01,534 --> 01:16:04,002
lf you tell your problems to him,
you'll get a solution immediately.

871
01:16:06,038 --> 01:16:10,668
He won't unite you but will separate you.
ls it okay?

872
01:16:11,344 --> 01:16:15,576
Why're you teasing us?
- Just for fun.

873
01:16:23,623 --> 01:16:25,181
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

874
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,083
Go.

875
01:16:28,928 --> 01:16:30,759
It seems he notes everything.

876
01:16:31,397 --> 01:16:36,664
Goutham, why're you looking so dull?
Can't you reveal you feelings to me?

877
01:16:37,303 --> 01:16:40,238
Why're you staring?
l've revealed them to you.

878
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:42,202
You haven't replied.

879
01:16:55,654 --> 01:16:57,679
Will I leave you if you come out?

880
01:16:57,957 --> 01:17:00,187
Tell me, you've fallen in love,
haven't you?- No.

881
01:17:01,093 --> 01:17:04,187
Are you walking all alone
without falling in love?- No.

882
01:17:04,563 --> 01:17:06,554
How can we believe you
if you deny that?

883
01:17:06,766 --> 01:17:09,291
I can feel that by
looking at you.- No.

884
01:17:09,502 --> 01:17:13,063
Don't torture him.
Let him come out by himself.

885
01:17:13,272 --> 01:17:14,534
I told you `No',
didn't I?

886
01:17:21,547 --> 01:17:25,984
Boy, if you keep standing here,
you'll get smashed.

887
01:17:43,169 --> 01:17:45,763
Haven't you slept?
- I don't feel like sleeping.

888
01:17:45,971 --> 01:17:49,839
Why?- Do you want me to give
reasons for that?

889
01:17:50,042 --> 01:17:54,445
Look, l'm your mother.
Tell me your problems.

890
01:17:54,847 --> 01:17:56,576
I wanted to tell you before itself?

891
01:17:57,049 --> 01:17:59,745
But, I was scared of you.

892
01:18:04,156 --> 01:18:07,990
Will you run away a day before
marriage or a week before?

893
01:18:08,427 --> 01:18:09,655
Don't be foolish.

894
01:18:09,862 --> 01:18:12,456
It was finalized 20 yrs. back
that you're for him.

895
01:18:12,998 --> 01:18:14,465
lt's not decided now.

896
01:18:15,134 --> 01:18:17,193
I can't deceive that girl.

897
01:18:17,403 --> 01:18:20,201
But we decided only on your approval.
You shook your head then.

898
01:18:20,473 --> 01:18:21,963
You people decided.

899
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:25,438
Won't I like to live with
a person close to my heart?

900
01:18:27,847 --> 01:18:32,045
I was strict with you
for your own good.

901
01:18:32,852 --> 01:18:37,312
You'll conduct our marriage,
bless us & walk away.

902
01:18:38,423 --> 01:18:41,153
Do you want me to live in agony?

903
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:44,658
Father, our marriage should
be performed only by your approval.

904
01:18:44,863 --> 01:18:47,661
Nice. lf everyone
decides on their own,

905
01:18:47,867 --> 01:18:48,993
What're we here for?

906
01:18:49,535 --> 01:18:52,333
What happened?
Why're you so worried?

907
01:18:53,205 --> 01:18:54,832
Don't talk like my husband.

908
01:18:55,875 --> 01:19:01,507
Gone are the days when we use
to match horoscopes & conduct marriages.

909
01:19:02,214 --> 01:19:03,181
lt's past.

910
01:19:03,716 --> 01:19:06,184
Nowadays they love for 10 days,

911
01:19:06,385 --> 01:19:10,344
And get married on the 11th day
in Registrar's Office.

912
01:19:11,891 --> 01:19:16,692
Feel happy that our children
are seeking our approval.

913
01:19:17,463 --> 01:19:18,862
How did you agree to this?

914
01:19:19,065 --> 01:19:25,368
We wanted to unite them
to keep them happy.

915
01:19:25,805 --> 01:19:29,036
But if they're not interested,
why should we force them?

916
01:19:29,742 --> 01:19:32,540
There's nothing wrong in adjusting
ourselves for our children.

917
01:19:37,483 --> 01:19:39,883
Everything will go well,
don't worry.

918
01:19:41,253 --> 01:19:45,053
First try to know whom she loves
& then conduct her marriage.

919
01:19:52,932 --> 01:19:55,230
Greetings".

920
01:19:55,434 --> 01:19:56,401
Headlines.

A girl committed suicide by
falling in front of the train.

927
01:20:21,627 --> 01:20:24,425
Though you forgot me.

928
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:25,756
Wow! Wonderful song.

929
01:20:26,532 --> 01:20:36,066
I didn't forget you.
Though l'm sleeping...

930
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:41,768
Ganesh, I want to talk a lot to you.

931
01:20:43,148 --> 01:20:46,276
I don't know what to say
& how to start.

932
01:20:49,988 --> 01:20:52,286
Do you know
l'm mad about you?

933
01:20:52,758 --> 01:20:54,123
Wow! my favourite.

934
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,523
Am I not beautiful?
Am I not educated?

935
01:20:56,929 --> 01:20:57,953
Am I not sexy?

936
01:20:58,330 --> 01:20:59,456
Or ls my exposure not enough?

937
01:20:59,998 --> 01:21:01,795
What should I do for
you to love me?

938
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,695
Tell me, please.

939
01:21:03,902 --> 01:21:05,369
I love another girl.

940
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:14,643
Take me with you.

941
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:29,154
Why did you switch it off?

942
01:21:30,195 --> 01:21:31,162
Sleep, you stupid.

943
01:21:32,698 --> 01:21:36,828
It seems he won't allow anyone
to love in movies also.

944
01:21:38,037 --> 01:21:39,504
Let me see what he'll do
ifl love in dreams.

945
01:22:02,728 --> 01:22:05,697
Look, life is not so easy
as you think.

946
01:22:06,231 --> 01:22:08,927
Since l'm lame, l'm working in this
restaurant even after my graduation.

947
01:22:09,234 --> 01:22:11,862
When people think twice before
giving me a job because l'm lame.

948
01:22:12,071 --> 01:22:15,199
How can I ask for your hand
from your father?

949
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:22,040
Atleast you live happily by marrying
the groom your parents have selected.

950
01:22:22,247 --> 01:22:23,612
You want me to be happy.

951
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:26,047
Won't you say that we both must be happy?

952
01:22:26,686 --> 01:22:29,883
Tell me to die
but not to leave you.

953
01:22:30,589 --> 01:22:31,886
l'm not prepared for that.

954
01:22:37,096 --> 01:22:39,564
Better than pondering about a life
without a distinct path,

955
01:22:40,099 --> 01:22:43,227
Think about a life in the path
we take now.

956
01:22:43,936 --> 01:22:44,903
Everything will be okay.

957
01:22:45,671 --> 01:22:47,400

958
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:48,734

01:22:59,285 --> 01:23:00,343
Better marry her.

960
01:23:07,793 --> 01:23:08,521
ls this nice?

961
01:23:15,067 --> 01:23:16,728
I shouldn't have asked you.

962
01:23:17,135 --> 01:23:18,329
It seems he's selecting a card.

963
01:23:20,539 --> 01:23:23,269
When you're giving it to your lover,
you must write your own thoughts.

964
01:23:23,475 --> 01:23:25,443
Why do you gift a card
written by someone else?

965
01:23:26,144 --> 01:23:27,270
Think something new.

966
01:23:27,579 --> 01:23:28,944
How could you get such ideas?

967
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:31,682
You're changing.

968
01:23:32,151 --> 01:23:32,947
Shake hands.

969
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:36,947
No one has ever said
such things before.

970
01:23:37,322 --> 01:23:39,790
l'll go home & write a lot.
Shake hands.

971
01:23:42,494 --> 01:23:43,392
Fit for nothing.

972
01:23:46,164 --> 01:23:47,131
Sir, don't you want these cards?

973
01:23:47,899 --> 01:23:50,800
Go. He gave me a golden message.

974
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:52,797
Will anyone buy this anymore?

975
01:23:53,172 --> 01:23:56,471
l'll write at home &
l'll some how make her fall for me.

976
01:24:27,305 --> 01:24:28,602
New Model! Are you interested, sir?

977
01:24:29,308 --> 01:24:30,275
Only one of it's kind.

978
01:24:37,149 --> 01:24:38,946
Hey, are you coming or not?
- Coming, boy.

979
01:24:44,156 --> 01:24:46,454
You spoilt his business,
can't you keep quiet?

980
01:24:46,658 --> 01:24:48,125
How many more days
will they cheat boys?

981
01:24:49,662 --> 01:24:50,128
Hey, come.

982
01:24:52,998 --> 01:24:54,966
Come on, I say.- Wait
l'll check these & come.

983
01:24:55,167 --> 01:24:55,963
Leave as it is, they'll
take care of it.

984
01:24:56,168 --> 01:25:00,969
Slowly, buddy! Don't pull &
throw me into the sea.

985
01:25:12,517 --> 01:25:13,484
Come near, I say.

986
01:25:15,687 --> 01:25:19,145
Do you know how the feeling
will be when you're in love?- No.

987
01:25:22,027 --> 01:25:23,153
Did you ever love anyone?

988
01:25:24,363 --> 01:25:25,990
One can eat crisps only
if one has teeth.

989
01:25:26,531 --> 01:25:27,828
Can I fall in love
when l'm with you?

990
01:25:28,533 --> 01:25:30,330
I too got many offers.

991
01:25:31,036 --> 01:25:32,663
But, I refused all of them
fearing your wrath.

992
01:25:33,472 --> 01:25:34,496
Not that buddy.

993
01:25:35,473 --> 01:25:38,169
Now, we're going straight
in a way.

994
01:25:39,544 --> 01:25:40,340
As we are going ....

995
01:25:40,879 --> 01:25:42,847
Suddenly, something
crosses our path.

996
01:25:43,215 --> 01:25:45,183
Where are we going and what
has crossed our path?

997
01:25:48,053 --> 01:25:51,352
For quite sometime, l've a feeling
that someone is following me.

998
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:55,018
I followed you just one night.
Please forgive me.

999
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,187
Trust me, l'll never
follow you again.

1000
01:25:57,896 --> 01:25:59,693
Don't take revenge on me for that.
- Hey, come here.

1001
01:25:59,898 --> 01:26:01,957
l'll not come.- He's refusing
to understand my feelings.

1002
01:26:02,167 --> 01:26:03,532
Suddenly, he's asking
if I love anyone.

1003
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:06,799
Would he have beaten me
ifl had said, yes?

1004
01:26:07,239 --> 01:26:08,035
I must be very careful.

1005
01:26:40,038 --> 01:27:15,070
TAMILINI

1006
01:27:15,474 --> 01:27:17,874
My love...my love ....

1007
01:27:19,812 --> 01:27:22,781
lt's love poetry in my eyes.

1008
01:27:24,082 --> 01:27:26,448
My love...my love ....

1009
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,448
lt's pain of love in my heart.

1010
01:27:32,658 --> 01:27:36,116
My body has become vast like Sea.

1011
01:27:36,995 --> 01:27:40,123
My life is hitting shore
like waves.

1012
01:27:40,999 --> 01:27:44,457
Dew has seeped into
a little rock.

1013
01:27:45,504 --> 01:27:48,473
...lt's testing my vow
of abstinence.

1014
01:27:49,007 --> 01:27:55,810
Oh Girl friend...
Come, my girl friend.

1015
01:27:57,683 --> 01:28:03,644
My dear girl friend.

1016
01:28:23,141 --> 01:28:48,524
TAMILINI

1017
01:28:49,067 --> 01:28:53,367
The place your eyes had set on, that place
has come under the limelight.

1018
01:28:53,572 --> 01:28:57,030
l've understood that, it's love.

1019
01:28:57,743 --> 01:29:01,873
Looking in a new angle,
talking in a new language.

1020
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:05,538
You've made the hearts
to change its place.

1021
01:29:06,084 --> 01:29:10,145
Oh Beautiful maiden!
Walking beautifully.

1022
01:29:10,355 --> 01:29:14,052
You've seized me with your army.

1023
01:29:14,426 --> 01:29:16,894
Stealing my sleep.

1024
01:29:17,095 --> 01:29:18,392
Oh! Flower, you're creating
new bonds with it.

1025
01:29:18,763 --> 01:29:21,891
You're arresting me with
your smile.

1026
01:29:23,102 --> 01:29:27,562
You made me despair slowly,
you changed me slowly.

1027
01:29:27,773 --> 01:29:31,231
You showed me the other
side of the heart.

1028
01:29:31,777 --> 01:29:33,745
What am I to say now?

1029
01:29:33,945 --> 01:29:35,742
l'm a combination of
nectar & poison.

1030
01:29:36,047 --> 01:29:39,915
l'll soar high into skies
without wings.

1031
01:29:57,102 --> 01:30:40,906
TAMILINI

1032
01:31:38,737 --> 01:31:39,362
l'll call you later.

1033
01:31:51,583 --> 01:31:52,208
What're you interested in, sir?

1034
01:31:53,251 --> 01:31:54,377
That's...here ....

1035
01:31:55,253 --> 01:31:57,380
...A small...beautiful gift.

1036
01:31:58,023 --> 01:31:59,047
You had asked me yesterday,
if l'm interested in it.

1037
01:31:59,257 --> 01:32:02,055
Oh! That one!
A girl has taken it.

1038
01:32:05,263 --> 01:32:06,730
She said her lover had liked it.

1039
01:32:07,265 --> 01:32:08,732
Did you like the same one?

1040
01:32:12,437 --> 01:32:13,904
There're other new models also.
Are you interested?

1041
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:22,906
Who? Goutham?

1042
01:32:23,949 --> 01:32:25,917
Not only he had spoilt my business
above that a phone call also.

1043
01:32:26,117 --> 01:32:26,583
Give me.

1044
01:32:29,454 --> 01:32:31,422
I know very well that
you'll come back here.

1045
01:32:31,956 --> 01:32:34,857
So, I bought the thing for
which you've come now.

1046
01:32:35,894 --> 01:32:36,758
Why're you surprised?

1047
01:33:35,854 --> 01:33:37,754
Unknowingly...
- Can't you watch & walk?

1048
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:39,315
Rogue, rascals.

1049
01:33:39,524 --> 01:33:40,491
They come only to dash
against girls.

1050
01:33:40,825 --> 01:33:42,315
You'll get beaten up.
Look at his face.

1051
01:33:42,527 --> 01:33:45,257
Please forgive me.
- mannerless brute.

1052
01:33:46,364 --> 01:33:48,332
Dashing against me & then says sister.
- Come, let's go.

1053
01:33:55,707 --> 01:33:58,005
First, let's eat something &
go to the internet cafe.

1054
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:59,336
lt's long time l've
not browsed.

1055
01:34:02,714 --> 01:34:05,683
Sorry? You do it & then say sorry.
- Unknowingly, I did.

1056
01:34:06,717 --> 01:34:09,686
Hey, come.
- Please forgive me.

1057
01:34:12,657 --> 01:34:14,522
Buddy, you created a sensation.
How can you do it every time?

1058
01:34:15,226 --> 01:34:16,022
You're lucky.

1059
01:34:17,395 --> 01:34:18,191
Whom did you dare to beat?

1060
01:34:25,236 --> 01:34:27,033
Playing fool with us.
Beat him boys.

1061
01:36:34,198 --> 01:36:35,665
On this Happy Valentine's Day.

1062
01:36:36,034 --> 01:36:41,666
I introduce mr & mrs Navaneetham from
Madurai, who're here to entertain you.

1063
01:36:54,118 --> 01:37:25,281
TAMILINI

1064
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:28,548
We've crossed 6o and
celebrated it grandly.

1065
01:37:28,753 --> 01:37:30,721
But, still we are lovers.

1066
01:37:31,923 --> 01:37:37,225
We started at 20, but our love story
is still going strong.

1067
01:37:37,928 --> 01:37:43,389
lt's Valentine's Day, it's a day
to enthuse everyone.

1068
01:37:43,935 --> 01:37:50,397
We're lovers always.
Let's celebrate love always.

1069
01:38:03,454 --> 01:38:27,973
TAMILINI

1070
01:38:28,479 --> 01:38:31,607
Never found a more beautiful
maiden than you.

1071
01:38:31,916 --> 01:38:34,612
When I searched all
over the country.

1072
01:38:34,819 --> 01:38:37,947
My dear young man.
My dear friend.

1073
01:38:38,156 --> 01:38:43,958
Our bond is unbreakable.
True love will never die.

1074
01:38:44,262 --> 01:38:47,129
lt'll never go the wrong way.

1075
01:38:47,331 --> 01:38:52,633
My heart is flying like a kite
to dance and celebrate.

1076
01:39:14,525 --> 01:39:15,856
He's going to do something.

1077
01:39:16,527 --> 01:39:53,061
TAMILINI

1078
01:39:53,398 --> 01:39:56,526
lf the girl in your heart lights
a lamp in your heart.

1079
01:39:56,734 --> 01:39:59,202
lf it bums eternally,
it's love.

1080
01:39:59,403 --> 01:40:05,535
Marrying her, holding her hand,
it's love, celebrating the union.

1081
01:40:05,744 --> 01:40:08,713
Everyone fall in love.

1082
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:11,878
Don't let it wither away.
Keep it alive & kicking.

1083
01:40:12,249 --> 01:40:18,381
Till you're alive & if you
keep it alive, it's love.

1084
01:41:07,138 --> 01:41:10,596
Doing all this & then sitting here
like an innocent.

1085
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:15,768
I think, this is the only worth while
thing you had done till date.

1086
01:41:17,982 --> 01:41:20,280
She's beautiful,
she's okay to me.

1087
01:41:23,654 --> 01:41:27,283
Shall I call you as younger sister
...No...elder sister?

1088
01:41:28,325 --> 01:41:32,284
No...no...call me just Maha.

1089
01:41:34,432 --> 01:41:35,626
You carry on, l'll be
back in a minute.

1090
01:41:37,001 --> 01:41:38,298
You know cooking very well,
don't you?

1091
01:41:39,170 --> 01:41:41,798
Kannan & his father have got bored
by maid servant's cooking.

1092
01:41:42,106 --> 01:41:43,971
Poor guys, l've escaped.

1093
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:02,985
Don't you want?

1094
01:42:13,038 --> 01:42:15,836
Looks like a young man
can't go out alone.- Why?

1095
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:19,009
Two girls standing there
were ogling at me.

1096
01:42:19,710 --> 01:42:23,339
Ogling at you? lt's really surprising.
- Shut up.

1097
01:42:24,382 --> 01:42:25,508
Don't embarrass me before her.

1098
01:42:31,222 --> 01:42:32,519
You must definitely
come to my home.

1099
01:42:33,391 --> 01:42:34,016
l'll go now.

1100
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:40,854
You never revealed the
identity of your lover.

1101
01:42:43,567 --> 01:42:44,192
l'll tell ....

1102
01:43:46,464 --> 01:43:47,590
What's this?

1103
01:43:50,301 --> 01:43:53,099
Don't let out a word about
it to her...got it?

1104
01:43:58,309 --> 01:43:58,866
Oh My God!

1105
01:44:13,658 --> 01:44:14,784
l'm Sandhya speaking.

1106
01:44:40,351 --> 01:44:41,318
What's he doing?

1107
01:44:41,519 --> 01:44:43,646
Gas man said he'll come
but not yet come.

1108
01:44:43,854 --> 01:44:45,253
They never keep up time.

1109
01:44:50,028 --> 01:44:51,325
Please listen carefully.

1110
01:44:52,362 --> 01:44:54,330
I can't speak for a
long time, got it?

1111
01:45:18,555 --> 01:45:20,022
Tell me, l'm Goutham speaking.

1112
01:45:20,224 --> 01:45:22,692
Come today evening by 7
to Chola Restaurant.

1113
01:45:23,394 --> 01:45:25,521
I want to discuss something
very important with you.

1114
01:45:28,566 --> 01:45:31,364
Don't forget its 7 PM.

1115
01:45:31,735 --> 01:45:32,360
Okay, l'll come.

1116
01:45:35,906 --> 01:45:37,533
Who was on the line?
- Some wrong call.

1117
01:45:37,808 --> 01:45:39,537
How's that only you get
wrong calls always?

1118
01:47:49,206 --> 01:47:50,173
What's all this, buddy?

1119
01:47:50,374 --> 01:47:52,342
What'll you do after
knowing it? move.

1120
01:48:02,386 --> 01:48:04,513
Hello brother, fixing the
pillion seat newly.

1121
01:48:04,721 --> 01:48:07,451
Have you found a girl?
- Boy, mind your work.

1122
01:48:31,749 --> 01:48:35,810
Couldn't meet you for 2 days?
Busy at home?

1123
01:48:36,653 --> 01:48:38,143
Do you really need an
answer for that?

1124
01:48:53,204 --> 01:48:54,569
Lady's finger are not tender.

1125
01:48:54,772 --> 01:48:57,570
Take it, let's go...Come...Come...
- What's this half way?

1126
01:48:57,775 --> 01:48:58,742
Let's do shopping later.
First, let's clear this place.

1127
01:49:00,111 --> 01:49:00,736
Please, call him.

1128
01:49:01,545 --> 01:49:03,740
Dear, he's calling you only.
- Shut up...let's go...

1129
01:49:03,947 --> 01:49:04,845
Sudhakar, why're you
running away? Stop.

1130
01:49:05,049 --> 01:49:05,674
Sudhakar, one minute.

1131
01:49:05,882 --> 01:49:07,577
Dear, your friend is calling you &
you're running away.

1132
01:49:07,784 --> 01:49:09,183
Do you want to live
with me or not?

1133
01:49:10,187 --> 01:49:12,417
lfl meet him, he'll say
something & separate us.

1134
01:49:12,890 --> 01:49:14,084
You don't know about him.
Come, let's go ....

1135
01:49:14,291 --> 01:49:17,089
Why don't you listen to me?
- What happened to him?

1136
01:50:29,366 --> 01:50:32,267
ls it fair to make me
wait so long. Good.

1137
01:50:54,224 --> 01:50:55,020
lsn't that painting beautiful?

1138
01:50:58,061 --> 01:50:58,686
Good.

1139
01:50:59,230 --> 01:51:01,198
You said you wanted to talk
something very important.

1140
01:51:01,898 --> 01:51:03,957
Thank God! Atlast you
had asked it.

1141
01:51:04,401 --> 01:51:07,199
The trouble l'm going through
after falling in love.

1142
01:51:08,071 --> 01:51:08,867
Oh God!

1143
01:51:10,741 --> 01:51:15,701
How many more days can I hide my future
husband from everyone?

1144
01:51:16,246 --> 01:51:20,046
So, l've decided to tell everyone
about him. What do you say?

1145
01:51:21,852 --> 01:51:23,945
Come quickly.
- Wait, l'm coming.

1146
01:51:25,089 --> 01:51:27,387
He's Arvind, my future husband.

1147
01:51:29,259 --> 01:51:32,057
Didn't I say, a man just like you.
He's that man.

1148
01:52:03,794 --> 01:52:04,260
Sit down.

1149
01:52:06,396 --> 01:52:07,590
Sandhya has told me
a lot about you.

1150
01:52:07,798 --> 01:52:10,426
She was adamant that
I must meet you first.

1151
01:52:12,068 --> 01:52:14,263
He was also like you, a love hater.

1152
01:52:14,471 --> 01:52:17,599
Do you know how much I had to go
through to bring a change in him?

1153
01:52:17,808 --> 01:52:18,934
Hey, keep quiet.

1154
01:52:19,877 --> 01:52:22,107
What else then? How many phone
calls I would've made.

1155
01:52:22,479 --> 01:52:25,107
ls love an easy thing?
- You've already won me.

1156
01:52:26,083 --> 01:52:30,452
Hereafter it's me, who's going
to call you...not you...

1157
01:52:33,490 --> 01:52:36,618
I feel relieved after telling you.
lsn't it, Arvind?

1158
01:52:37,994 --> 01:52:39,791
For this you had tortured me.

1159
01:52:39,997 --> 01:52:42,795
Goutham, why've you suddenly
gone off mood?

1160
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:43,832
Nothing like that?

1161
01:52:45,336 --> 01:52:46,234
Where're you going?

1162
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:48,469
Why should I be here as an
hindrance to you both?

1163
01:53:00,851 --> 01:53:03,649
She called me on phone.
...said she loves me.

1164
01:53:04,187 --> 01:53:07,816
Here, she's sitting with
some strange man.

1165
01:53:08,525 --> 01:53:12,484
...And says she's going to marry him.
l'm confused.

1166
01:53:13,096 --> 01:53:38,616
TAMILINI

1167
01:53:39,222 --> 01:53:43,852
Oh Maiden! you pricked my heart
with little thorns.

1168
01:53:44,227 --> 01:53:49,028
With your laser eyes, you have hurt
a young heart.

1169
01:53:49,566 --> 01:53:51,534
Are sorrows the only
companion l've?

1170
01:53:51,902 --> 01:53:54,200
Was I wrong to fall in love?

1171
01:53:57,240 --> 01:54:04,874
My life .... My life ....

1172
01:54:05,415 --> 01:54:09,875
lt's a sin to fall in love.
Womanhood is an illusion.

1173
01:54:10,587 --> 01:54:13,715
Maiden, l've realized this
truth because of you.

1174
01:54:15,859 --> 01:54:20,228
Eyes of women are traps.
All men are innocent.

1175
01:54:20,931 --> 01:54:24,059
Maiden, l've realized this
truth because of you.

1176
01:54:24,535 --> 01:54:57,200
TAMILINI

1177
01:54:57,634 --> 01:55:02,594
Thinking love is just a haste.
You came as a heavy down pour.

1178
01:55:02,806 --> 01:55:05,434
I came out to get drenched
in the rain.

1179
01:55:06,476 --> 01:55:11,277
You lit fire.
I was just a language.

1180
01:55:12,649 --> 01:55:16,949
...l blossomed as music
because of you.

1181
01:55:18,254 --> 01:55:23,453
Oh maiden, you're my life.

1182
01:55:23,827 --> 01:55:28,628
Why did you vanish like a broken dream?
Tell me, my dear.

1183
01:55:29,666 --> 01:55:33,796
Silence spoke.
Couldn't you hear it?

1184
01:55:34,838 --> 01:55:38,797
Couldn't your eyes
recognize my love?

1185
01:56:10,907 --> 01:56:46,803
TAMILINI

1186
01:56:47,244 --> 01:56:49,872
I went alone without
any companion.

1187
01:56:50,747 --> 01:56:52,214
You came as my shadow.

1188
01:56:52,416 --> 01:56:55,647
I became a student in
search of an answer.

1189
01:56:56,186 --> 01:57:01,385
You came in my way as
the answer of my search.

1190
01:57:02,359 --> 01:57:06,056
...Loved in your own way.

1191
01:57:08,098 --> 01:57:13,229
I fell in love and
expressed it.

1192
01:57:13,437 --> 01:57:18,568
But someone else has got your love.
I felt the hurt.

1193
01:57:18,876 --> 01:57:23,472
Love will never perish
till eyes are there.

1194
01:57:24,381 --> 01:57:28,909
men can never win till
women are around here.

1195
01:58:00,751 --> 01:58:44,691
TAMILINI

1196
01:58:45,361 --> 01:58:47,090
Sir, why're you still in
the office so late?

1197
01:58:47,531 --> 01:58:51,490
Any problem at home? l've been watching
you for quite sometime.

1198
01:58:52,035 --> 01:58:53,502
Your face is giving up.

1199
01:58:55,472 --> 01:58:58,498
You're an educated man. Don't feel hurt
that l'm advising you.

1200
01:58:59,476 --> 01:59:02,172
Like on roads, there'll be ups & downs
in a family too.

1201
01:59:02,546 --> 01:59:07,006
We must level it carefully. Don't get
dejected for such trivial things?

1202
01:59:07,718 --> 01:59:10,516
Before the problem goes out
of the hand, settle it.

1203
01:59:19,729 --> 01:59:20,855
Hey, drive carefully boy.

1204
01:59:21,064 --> 01:59:23,862
You came in like a buffalo
and advising me.

1205
01:59:24,067 --> 01:59:26,865
Hey Rascal! Why're you speaking
disrespectfully?

1206
01:59:28,238 --> 01:59:29,364
Hey, why're you beating me?

1207
01:59:36,746 --> 01:59:37,371
Are you drunk?

1208
01:59:39,082 --> 01:59:42,381
Come on, blow out.
Blow .... blow .... blow, man.

1209
02:00:28,966 --> 02:00:29,432
You?

1210
02:00:31,134 --> 02:00:31,759
Where're you going?

1211
02:00:34,637 --> 02:00:35,433
l'm going to see Kannan.

1212
02:00:38,308 --> 02:00:39,605
He has gone out of station
on official work.

1213
02:00:41,811 --> 02:00:43,278
He'll never go out without
informing me.

1214
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:44,879
Do you want him to tell
everything to you?

1215
02:00:45,649 --> 02:00:47,116
Go...mind your work.

1216
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,468
Brother, greetings.
- Where're you going?

1217
02:01:06,836 --> 02:01:08,303
Kannan's bike met with an
accident, isn't it?

1218
02:01:09,839 --> 02:01:10,464
They had sent it to get repaired.

1219
02:01:10,674 --> 02:01:12,141
My boss has sent a message
that bike's ready.

1220
02:01:16,346 --> 02:01:17,813
Okay, you go, l'll inform him.
- Okay, brother.

1221
02:01:41,204 --> 02:01:43,832
What happened?
- I fell from the speeding bike.

1222
02:01:44,374 --> 02:01:47,172
Bloody, tell me the truth,
what happened?

1223
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:52,178
l've told you, haven't I?
- Tell me, bloody fool.

1224
02:01:53,383 --> 02:01:53,940
I don't know.

1225
02:01:54,384 --> 02:01:56,011
Suddenly, 4 people came from
no where & beat me.

1226
02:01:59,056 --> 02:02:00,853
Did you do anything?- No.

1227
02:02:05,561 --> 02:02:07,529
Do you know them?- No.

1228
02:02:11,067 --> 02:02:11,863
Okay, when did this happen?

1229
02:02:12,401 --> 02:02:14,198
2 days ago near Poonga Nagar.

1230
02:02:16,239 --> 02:02:18,537
Look, leave this problem as it is.

1231
02:02:19,076 --> 02:02:20,202
Don't unnecessarily add
fuel to the fire.

1232
02:02:22,545 --> 02:02:24,638
lf we leave it casually,
no one will respect us.

1233
02:02:25,215 --> 02:02:26,739
You may not need your son.

1234
02:02:27,417 --> 02:02:28,384
But for me, my friend
is very important.

1235
02:02:50,172 --> 02:02:50,900
One tea please.

1236
02:03:14,464 --> 02:03:15,761
Any skirmish recently?

1237
02:03:16,899 --> 02:03:19,925
lt's skirmish always here,
which one are you inquiring?

1238
02:03:21,070 --> 02:03:25,097
Saturday evening, a bike rider
was beaten by 4 people.

1239
02:03:25,542 --> 02:03:26,372
Do you know them?

1240
02:03:27,377 --> 02:03:27,866
Who are you?

1241
02:03:29,645 --> 02:03:33,979
You appear to be well educated.
They're very bad people.

1242
02:03:34,351 --> 02:03:35,841
Just leave the place silently.

1243
02:03:37,254 --> 02:03:37,879
His name?

1244
02:03:38,421 --> 02:03:39,615
Please listen to me.

1245
02:03:45,729 --> 02:03:46,252
His name?

1246
02:03:46,896 --> 02:03:49,763
I think, you're inviting
trouble willingly.

1247
02:03:54,771 --> 02:03:56,261
Look, hen is coming...
Come .... come ....

1248
02:03:56,672 --> 02:03:57,297
lf you don't eat ....

1249
02:03:58,541 --> 02:04:01,203
lsn't there a bad guy there, he'll
come suddenly & take you away.

1250
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:25,995
Hey idiot, did you find only my
vehicle to commit suicide?

1251
02:05:01,504 --> 02:05:02,027
What's it, man?

1252
02:05:04,039 --> 02:05:06,872
I beg you, please spare me,
l'll go away.

1253
02:05:07,110 --> 02:05:08,577
I swear, l'll never do
like this again.

1254
02:05:09,245 --> 02:05:10,712
Trust me...no...

1255
02:05:09,245 --> 02:05:10,007
Buddy, pick up this card.

1256
02:05:22,325 --> 02:05:22,882
What's that sound?

1257
02:05:23,126 --> 02:05:24,115
Someone's beating Pandi.

1258
02:06:58,455 --> 02:07:01,583
Hey, don't kill me, if you want
l'll return the Rs.10,000 also.

1259
02:07:02,225 --> 02:07:02,850
Tell me, who was that?

1260
02:07:02,959 --> 02:07:04,051
The girl's father.

1261
02:07:18,742 --> 02:07:20,835
Hey, Who are you?
What do you want?

1262
02:07:21,878 --> 02:07:22,503
Who's this man?

1263
02:07:22,878 --> 02:07:24,175
Hey, Why're you closing
windows also?

1264
02:07:24,381 --> 02:07:26,178
l'm asking you and
what are you doing?

1265
02:07:26,582 --> 02:07:27,514
What do you want?

1266
02:07:27,717 --> 02:07:30,015
Hey, Don't take that.
- Father, what happened?

1267
02:07:30,219 --> 02:07:32,187
Don't take that, don't break it.

1268
02:07:36,592 --> 02:07:38,526
No...no...don't break it. No...

1269
02:07:40,663 --> 02:07:43,723
What have I done to you?
No, please don't.

1270
02:07:44,801 --> 02:07:46,132
You've done it and
moreover shouting at me.

1271
02:07:47,404 --> 02:07:48,336
What do you think of yourself?

1272
02:07:49,805 --> 02:07:50,464
You sinner.

1273
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:54,867
What did you say?

1274
02:07:55,310 --> 02:07:56,106
Are you a rowdy?

1275
02:07:56,312 --> 02:07:59,770
Who's a rowdy?
me or your father?

1276
02:08:03,085 --> 02:08:04,382
Are you such a big man to
send hired rowdies?

1277
02:08:04,620 --> 02:08:05,882
Please don't harm my husband,
spare him.

1278
02:08:06,589 --> 02:08:09,387
Your daughter also roamed
with him, kill her also.

1279
02:08:16,299 --> 02:08:18,290
Sitting here innocently.

1280
02:08:18,801 --> 02:08:19,893
I knew about you earlier itself.

1281
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:21,395
He's mad.

1282
02:08:22,238 --> 02:08:23,136
He got cheated believing you.

1283
02:08:27,443 --> 02:08:29,070
Was it happy to roam with him?

1284
02:08:31,714 --> 02:08:34,205
Your father would've found a groom,
a clerk like himself for you.

1285
02:08:34,951 --> 02:08:35,918
You would've accepted
the proposal.

1286
02:08:36,786 --> 02:08:38,276
You change men as easily
as changing your dress.

1287
02:08:39,989 --> 02:08:42,423
Let me see how many more days
you'll cheat men.

1288
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:46,090
For the anger, l've on you
I like to ....

1289
02:08:48,197 --> 02:08:49,095
Oh God! Save us.

1290
02:08:52,469 --> 02:08:53,595
lf anything happens to him.

1291
02:08:54,971 --> 02:08:56,438
Not one of you will be alive.

1292
02:08:59,242 --> 02:08:59,765
What happened father?

1293
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:13,254
Haven't you gone yet?

1294
02:09:15,492 --> 02:09:16,254
Not able to get sleep.

1295
02:09:16,925 --> 02:09:18,358
You go.- Why?

1296
02:09:18,928 --> 02:09:19,690
You goto sleep.

1297
02:09:20,329 --> 02:09:20,988
We'll go.

1298
02:09:34,944 --> 02:09:37,970
Why is she here?- Hey, wait don't
do any anything in haste.

1299
02:09:38,181 --> 02:09:40,046
Kill me, kill me in one stroke.

1300
02:09:45,087 --> 02:09:46,349
Why're you so arrogant?

1301
02:09:47,523 --> 02:09:49,218
You don't like me
from the beginning.

1302
02:09:50,026 --> 02:09:52,426
Because, you don't like `love'.

1303
02:09:53,729 --> 02:09:55,993
You're cheating yourself
with that feeling.

1304
02:09:56,198 --> 02:09:57,597
What do you know about me?

1305
02:09:57,866 --> 02:09:58,332
I know.

1306
02:09:59,002 --> 02:10:02,938
I know, you've a heart and
it is filled with love.

1307
02:10:03,372 --> 02:10:04,100
I know it.

1308
02:10:07,677 --> 02:10:09,406
The worker who was working
in your restaurant.

1309
02:10:11,314 --> 02:10:15,182
You had sent him along with
his lover stealthily.

1310
02:10:15,384 --> 02:10:16,180
Are you behaving like this
after doing that?

1311
02:10:17,553 --> 02:10:18,679
I had only told her.

1312
02:10:21,123 --> 02:10:23,216
How cheaply you had
talked about me.

1313
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:27,393
Do you know how much
I love Kannan?

1314
02:10:33,269 --> 02:10:35,737
Please forgive me.

1315
02:10:36,739 --> 02:10:39,469
I lost my sense giving in
to other's advice.

1316
02:10:40,543 --> 02:10:42,704
There's no connection between
what had happened & my daughter.

1317
02:10:44,513 --> 02:10:46,344
Any father in my place would do
like this only.

1318
02:10:46,816 --> 02:10:48,875
Infact, if it had been you.
You would also ....

1319
02:11:00,696 --> 02:11:02,163
I want to meet Kannan.

1320
02:11:30,793 --> 02:11:32,090
Maha, how come you're here?

1321
02:11:33,796 --> 02:11:36,128
Hey, l'm fine.
Why're you crying?

1322
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:43,866
Nothing, l'm fine.
Don't cry, Maha.

1323
02:11:45,941 --> 02:11:46,771
Am I not saying, l'm fine?

1324
02:11:48,010 --> 02:11:48,999
l'll be fine in few days.

1325
02:11:51,814 --> 02:11:53,042
Why're you crying?
l'm fine.

1326
02:11:55,918 --> 02:11:57,818
l'm responsible for all this.

1327
02:11:58,054 --> 02:11:59,544
Your father is crying
because of you.

1328
02:11:59,755 --> 02:12:00,221
No problem.

1329
02:12:01,157 --> 02:12:04,058
When l'm not able to bear it,
how could you?

1330
02:12:05,327 --> 02:12:06,487
Maha, don't cry.

1331
02:12:22,278 --> 02:12:24,644
After damaging everything, she's sitting
quite as if nothing's happened.

1332
02:12:33,189 --> 02:12:34,383
Greetings brother.
- Greetings.

1333
02:12:34,690 --> 02:12:35,418
Please sir.

1334
02:12:45,334 --> 02:12:45,823
How're you?

1335
02:12:47,536 --> 02:12:48,332
Hasn't anyone come from
your family?

1336
02:12:48,538 --> 02:12:49,004
No, l've come alone.

1337
02:12:49,204 --> 02:12:51,832
Arvind, father's waiting for you,
come quickly.

1338
02:12:53,343 --> 02:12:55,004
Couldn't you inform about
your late arrival?

1339
02:12:55,244 --> 02:12:56,609
I got vexed waiting for you.

1340
02:12:59,582 --> 02:13:01,106
ls it really her,
who had loved me?

1341
02:13:10,492 --> 02:13:11,925
Dear, your friend.

1342
02:13:13,228 --> 02:13:15,162
Come quietly, can't you understand
if I say once?

1343
02:13:26,909 --> 02:13:28,240
Hey, why're you sitting here?

1344
02:13:28,444 --> 02:13:30,105
No...you carry Oh.
- Go...you Carry Oh.

1345
02:13:52,668 --> 02:13:55,228
Pray the auspicious thread.

1346
02:13:59,775 --> 02:14:00,241
Come...come...

1347
02:14:00,476 --> 02:14:03,809
Am I not asking you?
Wait, you tell me the reason?

1348
02:14:06,949 --> 02:14:09,417
Oh! He's looking
indifferently at me.

1349
02:14:14,056 --> 02:14:16,889
Goutham, don't mistake me,
I found her last night here only.

1350
02:14:17,426 --> 02:14:19,121
Her father is an officer
with Electricity Board.

1351
02:14:19,929 --> 02:14:21,863
No relative of mine will give his
daughter in marriage to me.

1352
02:14:22,598 --> 02:14:23,496
l'll settle with her.

1353
02:14:27,203 --> 02:14:28,636
I beg you, buddy.

1354
02:14:29,305 --> 02:14:32,103
Love must come from here,
it shouldn't come from here.

1355
02:14:32,308 --> 02:14:33,605
Don't break my love by delivering
such dialogues.

1356
02:14:35,077 --> 02:14:36,772
l'll take this as your blessings.

1357
02:14:36,979 --> 02:14:38,105
Fast beat .... Fast beat ....

1358
02:15:01,136 --> 02:15:02,364
You're going to stay in
this city itself.

1359
02:15:02,805 --> 02:15:03,737
Won't we visit you often?

1360
02:15:04,940 --> 02:15:06,669
Then, we'll take leave.
Thanks, l'm happy.

1361
02:15:08,043 --> 02:15:08,668
Where's Kannan?

1362
02:15:09,411 --> 02:15:10,969
He was here only,
where did he go away?

1363
02:15:11,180 --> 02:15:12,044
Just now he was talking
with you.

1364
02:15:13,182 --> 02:15:13,705
I know it.

1365
02:15:14,650 --> 02:15:15,878
What do you want us
to do for that?

1366
02:15:16,152 --> 02:15:16,914
Are you a bachelor?

1367
02:15:17,653 --> 02:15:18,347
l'm a married man.

1368
02:15:24,093 --> 02:15:24,650
Oh, He has come.

1369
02:15:24,860 --> 02:15:27,328
Where did you go?- I was talking
to a friend.- Okay.

1370
02:15:27,663 --> 02:15:29,324
We'll take leave Sandhya,
we'll go...l'll go.

1371
02:15:29,531 --> 02:15:32,557
l'll go Uncle.- l'll go.
- Buddy, l'll go.

1372
02:15:37,406 --> 02:15:37,997
l'll go.

1373
02:15:39,709 --> 02:15:40,334
l'll go.

1374
02:15:41,710 --> 02:15:43,678
Don't relax as your
son is married.

1375
02:15:44,046 --> 02:15:45,445
You must conduct my daughter's
marriage also at the earliest.

1376
02:15:45,647 --> 02:15:46,841
l'll go uncle,
- l'll go brother.

1377
02:15:48,717 --> 02:15:49,911
Okay, brother-in-law.

1378
02:15:52,487 --> 02:15:55,320
You were more affectionate
on my son than me.

1379
02:15:56,158 --> 02:15:58,126
lfl had told anything harsh,
please forgive me.

1380
02:15:58,460 --> 02:15:59,484
Nothing like that.

1381
02:16:00,396 --> 02:16:01,124
l'll go.

1382
02:16:02,231 --> 02:16:02,993
Okay.

1383
02:16:06,568 --> 02:16:07,364
Come, let's go.

1384
02:16:08,904 --> 02:16:10,201
You go ahead. l'll come.

1385
02:16:11,239 --> 02:16:12,069
Come, let's go.

1386
02:16:12,474 --> 02:16:14,874
You desire to get him married.

1387
02:16:15,144 --> 02:16:16,076
...He's keeps on refusing.

1388
02:16:38,267 --> 02:16:40,394
Why do need a bike? You can walk.

1389
02:16:40,702 --> 02:16:41,566
You can save atleast petrol.

1390
02:16:42,271 --> 02:16:44,569
He's Arvind, my future husband.

1391
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:47,205
Didn't I tell you,
a man just like you.

1392
02:16:47,576 --> 02:16:48,065
He's that man.

1393
02:16:48,811 --> 02:16:51,575
Hey, Sakuni, l'm cursing you.

1394
02:16:51,781 --> 02:16:54,511
You'll also fall in love like me
and go through the pain.

1395
02:16:55,118 --> 02:16:56,585
You go against everyone
like this.

1396
02:16:57,019 --> 02:16:58,748
One fine day, you'll find
yourself all alone.

1397
02:16:59,121 --> 02:16:59,780
Not that, man.

1398
02:17:00,456 --> 02:17:03,516
l've a feeling from a long time
that someone's following me.

1399
02:18:26,642 --> 02:18:28,735
I love you for the past 2 years.

1400
02:18:29,644 --> 02:18:32,272
But, why do you always
run away from me?

1401
02:18:33,548 --> 02:18:35,243
l'm confused, how am
I to explain you?

1402
02:18:35,951 --> 02:18:37,748
You've the routine problem which every
college going student faces.

1403
02:18:38,187 --> 02:18:39,085
What can I do for that?

1404
02:18:39,522 --> 02:18:40,511
You don't need to do anything.

1405
02:18:41,257 --> 02:18:42,849
Just say you love me,
that's enough.

1406
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:47,322
Look, this is the last time
we are going to meet.

1407
02:18:47,763 --> 02:18:49,526
You'll be some where and l'll be
else where in future.

1408
02:18:50,198 --> 02:18:52,029
l'm sure, you'll not even
think about me.

1409
02:18:52,835 --> 02:18:55,167
No, l'll not go away from you.

1410
02:18:55,971 --> 02:18:57,336
l'll always think about you only.

1411
02:18:58,306 --> 02:19:01,173
l'll wait till you accept my love.

1412
02:19:01,777 --> 02:19:02,766
Let us see if such a thing happens.

1413
02:19:05,413 --> 02:19:06,380
How are you Goutham?

1414
02:19:15,223 --> 02:19:17,453
Didn't you say, l'll
forget about you?

1415
02:19:18,727 --> 02:19:22,060
l'll never forget you! I can't stop
myself from thinking about you also.

1416
02:19:23,198 --> 02:19:26,292
Still, your eyes are
very beautiful.

1417
02:19:47,122 --> 02:19:49,181
Take this, the thing you
wanted desperately.

1418
02:19:49,692 --> 02:19:50,351
Do you remember?

1419
02:19:56,131 --> 02:19:57,655
She said her lover liked it.

1420
02:19:59,568 --> 02:20:01,695
I can wait even 10 years for you.

1421
02:20:03,039 --> 02:20:04,870
Atleast then, understand my love.

1422
02:20:05,974 --> 02:20:08,033
Till then, l'll keep
on following you.

1423
02:20:34,069 --> 02:20:36,867
Let this be with me as
your remembrance.

1424
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:41,308
Leave her alone, atleast
let that girl be happy.

1425
02:21:05,201 --> 02:21:09,501
Leaving the girl who loves you.
You were searching else where.

1426
02:21:10,338 --> 02:21:10,827
Go.

1427
02:21:24,186 --> 02:21:24,743
Sorry?

1428
02:21:27,089 --> 02:21:28,283
l've asked sorry, haven't I?

1429
02:21:29,725 --> 02:21:31,522
Atleast give a smile now.

1430
02:22:13,535 --> 02:22:18,404
TAMILINI

1431
02:22:18,607 --> 02:22:23,670
No need of living a life
with someone.

1432
02:22:23,879 --> 02:22:28,612
Only you've the right to
lead a life of your choice.

1433
02:22:28,817 --> 02:22:37,418
To reach my lap & sleep
under one bed spread.

1434
02:22:39,027 --> 02:22:44,431
My dear, wipe your tears.

1435
02:22:44,633 --> 02:22:50,265
Sea & sky will fall in
love after us.

1436
02:22:50,472 --> 02:22:54,966
I was always in your heart
I never knew it.

1437
02:22:55,745 --> 02:23:00,114
l've understood the secret of
my being born as a woman.

1438
02:23:00,216 --> 02:23:10,751
TAMILINI

1439
02:23:10,893 --> 02:23:12,622
I don't want your
magnetic eyes.

1440
02:23:13,027 --> 02:23:15,291
lf you're peaceful, that's enough.

1441
02:23:15,631 --> 02:23:20,466
Let our hearts not sleep.
lt's enough if our eyes sleep.

1442
02:23:21,136 --> 02:23:23,161
No hurdles hereafter
in our life.

1443
02:23:23,438 --> 02:23:28,137
We'll go beyond the skies.

1444
02:23:28,743 --> 02:23:30,973
Oh Beautiful!

1445
02:23:31,113 --> 02:23:40,988
