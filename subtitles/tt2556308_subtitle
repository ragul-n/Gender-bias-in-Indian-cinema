1
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,035
Taxi!

2
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,471
Can I have some water, mom?

3
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:03,939
Try this biscuit.

4
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,003
Here.

5
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:11,177
Mom?

6
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:15,141
When is the training going to come?

7
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,873
It's due. It will be here soon.
- Give it to me.

8
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,177
Go and ask its correct arrival time.

9
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:23,214
To know the correct time,
wait for the train.

10
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,009
It will be here soon.
- At least find out where it is!

11
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,014
Where has it reached!
Call him up!

12
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,811
It will be here soon..

13
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,805
Hello?

14
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:50,469
Hi, this is Virat's sister.

15
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:52,075
Yes.
- Where has the train reached?

16
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:55,342
Actually the train has stalled
due to some problem with the engine.

17
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,938
Is my brother close-by?

18
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:58,102
Virat..

19
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,878
Yes, he is playing.

20
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,913
Virat! Virat! Virat!

21
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:05,306
Virat! Virat! Virat!

22
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,973
Virat! Virat! Virat!

23
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:11,109
Virat! Virat! Virat!

24
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:12,905
Yeah!

25
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,239
Come on, Virat!

26
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,106
Come on!

27
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,043
Virat! Virat! Virat!

28
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:25,913
Yes!
- Yeah!

29
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:29,373
Virat! Virat! Virat!

30
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,370
Yes!

31
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,710
Shit! Viral!

32
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:40,377
Yes!
- Come on, you can do it!

33
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,446
Yeah!

34
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:50,178
Yes!

35
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,807
Yes!

36
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:57,076
Virat! Virat! Virat!

37
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:58,077
Yeah!

38
00:05:58,933 --> 00:05:59,877
Yes!

39
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:05,013
Come on, Virat! Come on!

40
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:08,773
Virat! Virat! Virat!

41
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,971
Come on, champion!

42
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:17,248
Where did sir come from?

43
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:19,906
Virat! Come on!
- Look behind you!

44
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:20,945
Come on!
- Look behind you!

45
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,104
Go on!

46
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:23,803
Look behind you!
- What happened?

47
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,103
Captain Virat IC58664 reporting sir!

48
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,040
Damn!

49
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:40,712
Oh God!

50
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:46,202
Sorry, sir.

51
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,679
I didn't know I was standing on muck.

52
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:50,235
Let me wipe it off.

53
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,274
Good block, sir.

54
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:53,677
Sir..

55
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:56,739
The muck.. I, sir..

56
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,869
Sir, the train is signalling us.

57
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:01,843
Sir, you can clean
this up in its bathroom.

58
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,573
Let's go, sir.
Let's go!

59
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,237
Let's go! Hurry up! Let's go!

60
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,246
Hurry up! Let's go!

61
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,312
'Your attention please.'

62
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:22,038
'Jammu to Mumbai,
Soldier Holiday Special Express..'

63
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,104
It's here!
- 'Train No. 12472..

64
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:27,977
...Is arriving on Platform No. 5.'

65
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,273
'Thank you.'

66
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,808
Brother.. Brother..

67
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,603
Everyone's here except Virat.

68
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,977
Where is he?
- There he is! Look, mom!

69
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,979
Brother! Hi, brother!
- Virat!

70
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:53,106
Brother! Let's go!
- Let's go!

71
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,178
How are you?
- I am fine. How about you?

72
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:58,746
Virat!
- Dad!

73
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:00,075
Hello!

74
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,511
Dad, they are my friends.
He's Vishal..

75
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,103
Virat, we don't have time.
Let's go.

76
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,202
Yes, let's go.
- But my friends..

77
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:06,775
We are in a hum].
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

78
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,540
Listen to me..
- Where are you taking him?

79
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,840
I'll see you guys later!
- Hurry up!

80
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,607
I'll talk to you later.
- Call me.

81
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:12,941
Where are we going, dad?

82
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:15,035
Yes. Bye.
- First let's get out of here.

83
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:16,842
Let's go.
- But what's the hum]?

84
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,847
Just come with us.
Get inside. Get inside the taxi.

85
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,208
Let's go.
- Keep the bags there.

86
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,946
Yes, over here.
- Get in.

87
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,172
Come on.

88
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:31,611
Hit the third gear, sir.

89
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:36,111
What's the hum], dad?
Where are we going?

90
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,010
Don't you know?

91
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:39,944
Otherwise,
why would I be asking you?

92
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,844
Shut up and listen.

93
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:44,140
We are going to see a bride for you.

94
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:47,214
The auspicious time
ends in 23 minutes.

95
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:50,243
After 5:00pm the alignment
of the stars will change.

96
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,537
And Shraddha period
begins from tomorrow.

97
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,240
No one will introduce their
daughter to you after that.

98
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,639
We need to see this girl before that.

99
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,977
Otherwise,
you idiot will always remain single.

100
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:03,476
Mom, I'll go wearing
my military outfit?

101
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:04,409
So what?

102
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:08,938
Let's go home,
rest, eat, freshen up and then go.

103
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:12,171
You are not getting any younger, son.

104
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,639
A single day won't change my age.

105
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:17,075
Quiet, all of you.

106
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:19,044
Sorry.
- Hit the fourth gear, sir.

107
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,580
It's a taxi,
and not an aeroplane, sir.

108
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,078
We've reached.
- Your destination.

109
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:24,669
They are here.

110
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:25,734
Hi.
- Hello.

111
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,575
Welcome.
- Welcome.

112
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,135
Hi.
- Hello.

113
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,935
Hello.

114
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,974
Your son didn't come with you?

115
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,738
He is my son.

116
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:40,171
His clothes suggest he has
just returned from a battlefield.

117
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,541
Let's go.
- This way.

118
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,635
Let's go.

119
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,777
This way.
Please come.

120
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,909
Three wickets down
at the door itself.

121
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:52,810
Hi.
- Hello.

122
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,168
Welcome.

123
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:55,605
Jai Hind.

124
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,769
Have a seat.
Please have a seat.

125
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,645
Oh.

126
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:06,511
You are late.

127
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,735
Look at this..

128
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,972
Couldn't help it.
The train got delayed.

129
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,640
Close the buttons at least.
- We couldn't have driven it.

130
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,607
Did you have any trouble
finding out house?

131
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:17,975
No, not at all.

132
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,608
We needed to see the girl
before the auspicious hour ends.

133
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:25,614
That's why we brought him
here directly from the station.

134
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,170
Please Call her.

135
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:28,070
Yes, of course.

136
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,478
Call her.

137
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:30,511
Yes.

138
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:31,845
Saiba.

139
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,470
Saiba!

140
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:42,703
Sister!

141
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,870
She's Saiba?

142
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,146
Oh, thank God.

143
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,840
Thank you.

144
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,742
Saiba sings well.

145
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,676
What would you like to hear?

146
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:44,505
Any nice song will do.

147
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,738
Look at his clothes,

148
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,746
<i>'Jana Gena Mane' sounds pefiem.</i>

149
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,473
She's nice, isn't she?

150
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,337
Do you have her phone number?

151
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:29,445
“Her!" Already!

152
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,777
0226276..
- Just a minute, mom.

153
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,312
022..

154
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:35,739
789.

155
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,610
Hello?

156
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,005
Hi, I am Virat.

157
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:43,439
Silence! That boy has called.

158
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:44,873
Yes, son?

159
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:47,675
Uncle, I wanted to say that
your daughter is very beautiful.

160
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,007
Oh!
- Beautiful.

161
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:52,874
But it seems that
we have different tastes.

162
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:55,914
I don't think we
will make a good match.

163
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:59,773
But I pray that you
find someone better than me.

164
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:01,671
Sorry for the trouble.

165
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:03,576
Stupid! What's your problem!

166
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:04,634
Forget it!

167
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,407
I don't think he
will never get married!

168
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:09,311
Why didn't you like her!
Give me at least one reason!

169
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:10,869
Not one, I have three reasons.

170
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,470
What? - What?
- What?

171
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:14,303
She plait is a metre
long and then some.

172
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,209
That's not an excuse.
- So what?

173
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:19,805
Girls with hair longer than 6 inches
take 1V2 hours to get their hair done.

174
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,370
In her case, she will take six hours!

175
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:24,879
I'll have to wait the
whole day to go for a party.

176
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:27,310
Did I tell you?

177
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:29,308
Did I ask you to get me married?

178
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:30,277
Did I?!

179
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,437
Secondly..

180
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:34,580
She is very shy and timid.

181
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:42,611
Saw that?

182
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,647
She raised her hand on her father.

183
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,643
You should have been
strict from the beginning.

184
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,872
“Hit papa! Hit papa!"

185
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:50,776
You got her into this habit.

186
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:52,344
And what's the third reason?

187
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,313
And the third reason
is that I want a stylish girl.

188
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,869
An impressive girl.

189
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:59,675
She looks like she has
just come from a village.

190
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:08,509
Hey!

191
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,438
What.
What are you doing?

192
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:12,643
Hey!

193
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,646
Why do you need so much money?

194
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,839
I served coffee to six people.

195
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:20,476
This is a tip for that.

196
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,446
Hey..
- Bye!

197
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:27,576
According the post-modem report.

198
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,477
This woman committed suicide
by setting herself on fire.

199
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,275
Impossible.
This isn't a suicide. It's murder.

200
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:37,510
Soles of who commit suicide by setting
themselves on fire never burn.

201
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,308
This..
- Her soles are burnt.

202
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:41,404
Someone killed her,
made her lie down..

203
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:46,473
Pour an accelerant on her, started
a fire and declared it as suicide.

204
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:49,309
Your case is solved.
Just find the murderer.

205
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:52,240
You started already?

206
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,508
When I came to know
that you are coming..

207
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,205
I thought of taking a
leave and going to Madgaon.

208
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:58,440
But my luck simply..

209
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,476
My leave wasn't approved.

210
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:04,515
Just say that I trouble you.
Why are you beating around the bush?

211
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:06,444
Oh really? I should just say it?

212
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,443
Virat, you take a holiday
and come here even] year.

213
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,444
Yes, I do.

214
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,774
You spend your days with me.

215
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:11,743
Yes, I do.

216
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,279
You meddle in my affairs.

217
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,403
Yes, I do.

218
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:19,141
Whenever I am about to get
promoted to being an inspecton.

219
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,574
You ruin my chances and I
get stuck at being a sub-inspector.

220
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:23,805
Listen..

221
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,306
I'll no longer meddle
in your affairs.

222
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:28,574
Happy?
You won't face any problems.

223
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:32,612
Just a minute.
Here.

224
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,279
Solve it.

225
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,438
What's happening?

226
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:41,673
A sports tournament.

227
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,542
We're providing security for it.

228
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:47,137
Hi, Rocky!

229
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,077
Hi, Rocky!

230
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,443
Let's go.
Do you want to provide security?

231
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,740
Do you want to hang out with him?

232
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:57,212
Rocky is retiring tomorrow.

233
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:59,369
Today is his last day on duty.

234
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,272
He is very smart.

235
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:04,246
A few days back there was an
article on him in the Mumbai Mirror.

236
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,038
What's wrong with his paw?

237
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,374
He broke a bone during practice.

238
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,309
Department doesn't need
him because he has a broken bone.

239
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,672
So they are retiring him.

240
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:15,168
Strange, isn't it?

241
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:19,042
You are looked after only
till the time you are needed.

242
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,444
From tomorrow he
will be a street dog.

243
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:24,680
Can I take Rocky with me tomorrow?

244
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,710
Sure.

245
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:30,440
Fine. I'll take him in.

246
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,737
Fantastic.
- Bye, Rocky.

247
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,176
Security is perfect?
- Yes, sir.

248
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:43,004
Don't let anyone in without proper ID.
- Okay, sir.

249
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:50,269
Mukund..
- Yes?

250
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,075
There's a lot of beauty here.

251
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,704
Control your emotions.
I'm on duty.

252
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,246
Yes, sir.

253
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,107
Not so seriously. Control.

254
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:06,442
Beauty reminds me,
we went to see a girl yesterday.

255
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,501
How was she?

256
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:09,343
Don't ask.

257
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,380
I got so bored! Just don't ask!

258
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:14,505
Intercollegiate boxing
championship is about to begin.

259
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:19,482
We first call upon, Saiba Thapar
from St. Xavier's college, Mumbai!

260
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:24,176
She is very delicate.

261
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:27,612
V9"! Shy type, you know..

262
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:51,604
You know the rules. Box.

263
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
Come on, Saiba. Don't give up!

264
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,873
Come on, Saiba!
Saiba, you can do it!

265
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:12,372
You can do it, Saiba!
- Saiba!

266
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:13,571
Come on, Saiba!

267
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:15,169
Better focus!

268
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,137
I don't like this girl at all!

269
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:25,313
One, two..

270
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:28,144
Three, four..

271
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:31,311
Five, six..

272
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,311
Seven, eight.

273
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,569
Nine, ten!

274
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:40,578
And the winner is, Saiba Thapar!

275
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,244
You should marry someone like her.

276
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,211
Saiba! Saiba! Saiba!

277
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:48,476
Right?
- She is the girl I met that day.

278
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:09,510
“L like to wander,
but I am not wayward."

279
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:17,514
“I gave my head free rein,
but I didn't let it spoil me."

280
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:24,479
“Now I feel, without you,
I can no longer survive.”

281
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:31,577
“lf not you,
there shall be no one else.”

282
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:35,280
“Only you rule my thoughts.”

283
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:39,008
“Only you bring me peace."

284
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:42,913
“In this world filled
with fake intoxication..”

285
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:46,540
“Only you give me a high.”

286
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,270
“Only you rule my thoughts.”

287
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:54,042
“Only you bring me peace."

288
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,912
“In this world filled
with fake intoxication..”

289
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:01,813
“Only you give me a high.”

290
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:04,435
“Loving you has made me feel alive.”

291
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,173
“I forget everything,
after looking into your soul.”

292
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:09,180
“This is what your love does to me."

293
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:31,471
“Why you are the only one I desire?

294
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:35,140
“Why can't I see anyone beyond you?”

295
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:39,081
“I wonder what brought
about these changes.”

296
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,274
“I am crazy about you.”

297
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:46,310
“Why have all the games changed?”

298
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:50,338
“Why are all my desires
limited to you?”

299
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,007
“I wonder what brought
about these changes.”

300
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:57,139
“I am crazy about you.”

301
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,941
“Bedazzles me..”

302
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,002
“Your style.”

303
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:02,478
“I like.."

304
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:04,474
“Your style.”

305
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,269
“Chaste is.."

306
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,040
“Your style.”

307
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,139
“Oh, the magical
spell you cast on me!"

308
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,841
“Only you rule my thoughts.”

309
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,438
“Only you bring me peace."

310
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,312
“In this world filled
with fake intoxication..”

311
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:27,076
“Only you give me a high.”

312
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:30,876
“Only you rule my thoughts.”

313
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:34,403
“Only you bring me peace."

314
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:38,244
“In this world filled
with fake intoxication..”

315
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,510
“Only you give me a high.”

316
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,180
“Only you are the one
I have lost my head to."

317
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:00,840
“Whatever I am,
however I am, I am yours.”

318
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,677
“I am the shore where
your desires gather.”

319
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:08,146
“How do I say this?”

320
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,977
“Only for you,
I've come down to this earth.”

321
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:15,742
“I am the signal
of your innocent eyes.”

322
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,407
“I am the shore where
your desires gather.”

323
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:22,846
“How do I say this?”

324
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,345
“You are close to me..”

325
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,107
“Just a little.”

326
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:28,204
“You are my thirst.”

327
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:30,178
“Just a little.”

328
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:31,974
“You are the one that suits me."

329
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:34,070
“Just a little.”

330
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,844
“Now I belong to you.”

331
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,404
“Only you rule my thoughts.”

332
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:45,171
“Only you bring me peace."

333
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:48,908
“In this world filled
with fake intoxication..”

334
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,779
“Only you give me a high.”

335
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,246
“Only you rule my thoughts.”

336
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,009
“Only you bring me peace."

337
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:03,810
“In this world filled
with fake intoxication..”

338
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:07,337
“Only you give me a high.”

339
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,610
“Loving you has made me feel alive.”

340
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,169
“I forget everything,
after looking into your soul.”

341
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:15,874
“This is what your love does to me."

342
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:20,272
No! No! Absolutely not!

343
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,910
Earlier you sought
three faults in her.

344
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,879
Now you feel that she is the moon.

345
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,970
Mom, how will a phone call
make any difference to you?

346
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,706
Your son will get
a chance to settle down.

347
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,303
Try and understand.
Just one phone call.

348
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:32,710
Happy birthday, mom,

349
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:34,838
I celebrated my birthday last month.

350
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:36,605
And you are giving me a gift today!

351
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,044
That too a dog!
- Please, mom.

352
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,807
Consider it a belated
birthday gift. Mom..

353
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:41,039
Your pencil.

354
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:44,009
Hey, make the phone call, please.

355
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,703
Just one call for your brother.
- No.

356
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:46,302
Please?

357
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:48,074
See. Happy birthday-

358
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,772
I hate dogs!

359
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,140
Both of you, get out of here!

360
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,043
Is this a joke?

361
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:57,612
He didn't like me the other day.

362
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:58,839
Now he likes me.

363
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,276
Will it do if again after
marriage he says he doesn't like me?

364
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:05,206
Look, you got your first
proposal when you were 13.

365
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:08,146
I've been getting text
messages since I was 10!

366
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,612
Like you, I too have rejected many.

367
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:14,706
You know, I used to get loads
of text messages when I turned 18.

368
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:19,077
Then as my age progressed
the number of text messages declined.

369
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:23,206
Now the only text messages I get are
from customer care and call centres.

370
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:27,647
Look, you should display some
attitude but then you should give in.

371
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,906
Got it?

372
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,980
Anything you say won't
make any difference to me.

373
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,843
Oh God.

374
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:36,780
You go to buy one article
and you end up buying plenty.

375
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,312
To go shopping with your wife..

376
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:40,274
A person gets bored to death.

377
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:42,271
Please don't get married, Virat.

378
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:43,739
I am telling you.

379
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,307
Hey, this..

380
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,735
Man] Kom..

381
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,880
Isn't she the same boxer?

382
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:56,669
Handsome.

383
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:57,711
He's hot.

384
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,039
Say hi to him.

385
00:24:59,134 --> 00:25:00,772
He's the one I rejected.

386
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,607
What are you doing?

387
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:11,645
Look"

388
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,204
Hey!

389
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,575
I'll fall down!

390
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:46,846
This is a police bike. I am on duty.

391
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:53,712
Hey..
Get down!

392
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:54,837
What happened?
- Get down!

393
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,937
Okay. Okay. Okay!
- How dare he!

394
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:58,202
Move aside!

395
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:00,037
Hey!
Why did you kiss me?

396
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,774
When did I kiss you?

397
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,437
I kissed my mirror.

398
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,535
This mirror belongs to me.

399
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,011
I can do anything
I want to do with it.

400
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,137
The mirror might be yours
but the face in it is mine!

401
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,539
Just a minute. This mirror
belongs to the government.

402
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,772
Hey..
- Hey!

403
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:13,879
I can do anything I
want to do with this mirror.

404
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,506
I can love it, kiss it or break it!

405
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:18,977
Why just you? I'll break it!

406
00:26:19,034 --> 00:26:20,707
Just a minute, madam. No violence!

407
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:21,542
This is a public road.

408
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,079
So? He can kiss in
the middle of the road?

409
00:26:23,133 --> 00:26:24,578
And you? You are a cop, right?

410
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:25,976
Why are you standing
here quietly like a fool?

411
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:27,137
Let's go, Saiba.
- Look, ma'am, you..

412
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,572
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

413
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:29,840
Aren't you ashamed of eve-teasing?

414
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,005
Let's go. Let's go.
- I'll break your jaw!

415
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,104
Let's go.
- Ifl see you here again, I'll kill you!

416
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:35,669
Let's go, girl! Let's go!

417
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:37,406
Get inside.
- Keep moving. Keep moving.

418
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:39,105
Keep moving. Come on!

419
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:41,477
Ask for boxer Saiba!
- Yes, we will.

420
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:42,569
Then you will know who I am.

421
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:44,670
Couldn't you have found
a better place to romance?

422
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,444
Move on, man!
- Hey!

423
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:54,638
She has the keys to my bike!

424
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,908
So what? Push it.
- Push..

425
00:26:58,067 --> 00:27:01,480
If only you wouldn't
have rejected her..

426
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,912
My bike won't have lost its mirror.

427
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,507
Isn't she great, Makiya?

428
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:12,375
She took the bike keys while talking
to us and we didn't even realise.

429
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:15,073
Not while talking,
while verbally abusing us.

430
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,542
Tell me what did my depanmenfs
bike have to do with your quarrel?

431
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:22,844
My purse! My purse!

432
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,346
Has someone seen my purse?
It contains Rs. 5000!

433
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,071
Has someone seen my purse?

434
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:27,074
Hey Romeo,
something happening over there.

435
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,869
Someone has stolen it. I had it with me.
- Come on, go ahead.

436
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:29,934
My purse.. Where is my purse?

437
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:31,708
It contained Rs. 5000 in it!
- Silence!

438
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:32,868
My purse.. Please. Please.
- You want your purse, right?

439
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,901
Yes.
- You will get it.

440
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:35,105
We are with the police.

441
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:36,641
No one will move from their place.

442
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,872
Stop the bus.

443
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:40,709
Ask him to stop the bus.
- I'll get down from the front.

444
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,876
You will get your purse.
Come on. Come on.

445
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,343
Come over here.

446
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,572
Ask everyone to get
down one by one. - Okay.

447
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:47,441
Hurry Up-

448
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,843
Come on everyone,
get off the bus, one by one.

449
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,709
Everyone, get off the bus. Hurry up.
- Come on.

450
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,779
Come on.
- Everyone, get off the bus one by one.

451
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:53,877
This one?
- Come on, get down.

452
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:55,378
Is this the one? - No.

453
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:58,073
Come on, get down.
- Leave. Come on.

454
00:27:58,434 --> 00:27:59,777
Do I look like a thief to you?

455
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,340
This one?
- No. - You can leave.

456
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:04,640
Do one thing.
Go inside and check under the seats.

457
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,508
Yes, sir.
- Okay?

458
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:06,875
Go and check if it is under the seat.

459
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:08,003
Is this the one?

460
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,471
Look"
- No.

461
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:12,271
Come on!
Come on! Get off from the front!

462
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,976
Open her bag.
- She? Open your purse.

463
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,741
You will even check ladies purses?

464
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,507
No, it's not there.

465
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,336
Who's next?
- No. Not this one.

466
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,004
Some of you get down from here.

467
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,775
Yes, come on.
- Not this one.

468
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:28,369
This one?

469
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:39,675
Got it!
Got it! This is my purse!

470
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:41,338
I got my pugsgint it!
e. I
got my pUTSe!

471
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,505
This is the one!
- Virat, we found the purse!

472
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:47,974
Hand him over to the police!
- Hit him!

473
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,471
Virat! What's wrong, Virat?

474
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:55,504
Virat!

475
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:10,207
Hey you..

476
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:11,610
Why.. why did you need to run?

477
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,305
Why were you running?

478
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:14,345
Why did you run?

479
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,737
Why did you run? Yes?
Why did you run?

480
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:20,874
Why are you looking over there?

481
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,701
Hey..

482
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:48,677
Hey!

483
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:59,543
We gathered all the information.

484
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,739
We knew that we would
catch him one day.

485
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,542
Very soon I'll catch all
the terrorists behind this attack.

486
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:07,512
Don't worn].
Mumbai is safe as long as I am here.

487
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,304
I have worked day and night
and caught this terrorist.

488
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:13,507
And it's assumed, their aim
wasn't to blow up just one bus.

489
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:15,376
They have a hidden
agenda behind this.

490
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:17,175
And we need to find that out.

491
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,211
ViraL. Let's go
and give an interview.

492
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:28,137
Let's go.
- Let's go.

493
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:30,743
Not there. Let's go this way.

494
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,539
'Sir, it's often seen
that the Mumbai police..'

495
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,240
'..has been unable to capture
the terrorists behind the blasts.'

496
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,278
'Even if they capture them.'

497
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,473
Instead of questioning him,
they are giving him VIP treatment.

498
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:49,676
Let me assure you, I can
die for the people of this country.

499
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:52,373
He's blabbering as if
he is the one who caught him.

500
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,839
Actually, I should've been there.

501
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,736
But you dragged and brought me here.

502
00:32:00,234 --> 00:32:05,377
Let me assure you, I won't rest
in peace till this case isn't solved.

503
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,776
If I would've been on TV..

504
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:11,805
First of all, my mother-in-law
would've been stunned.

505
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:15,542
I would've gained a lot of respect.

506
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:20,107
I would've become an inspector.

507
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,339
Very soon the will
be brought before the law.

508
00:32:54,234 --> 00:32:57,772
'Among those who died in the bus bomb
blast included women and children.'

509
00:32:57,834 --> 00:33:02,078
'According to the police, the terrorist
caught, Aseem Lala, is behind it.'

510
00:33:02,134 --> 00:33:07,015
'They also state that there can be other
terrorist organisations behind it.'

511
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:09,069
'But this has still
not been confirmed.'

512
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:13,513
'Police state that the terrorists
behind it won't be spared.'

513
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:17,606
'Home ministry has recommended formation
of a high level investigation team.'

514
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,147
'And also assured that the
security is being tighten up.'

515
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,146
'Those behind these attacks.'

516
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:58,076
Patil, I need someone
at the back-street.

517
00:33:58,133 --> 00:33:59,134
Okay, sir.

518
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:00,439
He is here.

519
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:06,979
What is it?
- We were waiting for you.

520
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:08,171
Let's go.

521
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,470
Come inside.

522
00:34:14,334 --> 00:34:16,280
This is Virat's house.

523
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,176
Do as you have been briefed.

524
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:21,177
Okay, sir.

525
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:23,174
You are all on unofficial duty.

526
00:34:23,633 --> 00:34:26,375
Set your Walkies
to a different channel.

527
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,674
What is it, Makiya? At this hour?

528
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,443
They will be here tonight,
for security.

529
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,947
Do one thing. Take your
family somewhere tomorrow morning.

530
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,070
Just for a few days.

531
00:34:37,134 --> 00:34:38,704
Why? What happened?

532
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,306
That terrorist escaped
from the hospital.

533
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:43,604
What?

534
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:44,604
Yes.

535
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,013
He killed a doctor
and two of my cops.

536
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,943
But how?

537
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,243
I don't know.
In spite of so much security.

538
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,037
You got him arrested.

539
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,307
So he could come here and attack you.

540
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,611
That's why they are here.

541
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:02,047
Don't worn]. Go to sleep.

542
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,875
I'll make a move.

543
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:06,369
Keep YOU!' eyes open, GUYS!

544
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,474
Rocky..

545
00:36:17,067 --> 00:36:19,411
Yes, sir. I have sent
Tawde and Patil to Gate No. 2.

546
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,970
I have never seen so much
security being given by police.

547
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:28,080
Hey!

548
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:32,004
Hurry up!

549
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,077
Catch him!

550
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,277
He must have gone straight ahead.

551
00:37:10,334 --> 00:37:11,938
Sun/avanshi, where are you? Wait.

552
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,377
I am coming.
- Okay, sir.

553
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,939
Hurry up! Tambe, this way!

554
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:22,915
What wrong did those
innocent kids do to you?

555
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:45,339
You know why did I sever your
finger without first questioning you?

556
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:48,038
Because now I am going
to ask you a question.

557
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:51,273
And if you don't answer me,

558
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,307
you know the consequences.

559
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,669
One question.

560
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:01,277
One second.

561
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,005
If you don't answer me..

562
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:07,971
Another finger.

563
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:17,775
Someone helped you
escape from the hospital.

564
00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:20,170
Who was it?

565
00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:23,175
ACP Ashok Gaikwad.

566
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,008
So simple.

567
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:45,108
Who is it?

568
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:46,145
It's me.

569
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:51,770
What do you want at
this hour of the night?

570
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:53,608
Leave. We'll talk in the morning.

571
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,076
I want to talk to you now.
Come on the terrace.

572
00:39:56,134 --> 00:39:58,842
I told you to leave.
We'll talk in the morning.

573
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,074
Leave.

574
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:02,938
Look, your friend's picture.

575
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:18,373
The one you helped escape
is a guest in my house.

576
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,144
Sorry I didn't tell you who I am.

577
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,976
My name is Virat.

578
00:40:28,234 --> 00:40:29,804
Indian Army.

579
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,008
Not just that.

580
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:35,247
D.l.A.

581
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,847
Defence Intelligence Agency.

582
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,080
I am a specialist over there.

583
00:40:42,134 --> 00:40:44,080
A secret agent with the army.

584
00:40:45,867 --> 00:40:50,612
My friends who work with
me don't know about this.

585
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,376
Not even my family knows about this.

586
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:58,240
Why am I telling you all this?

587
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:00,940
I am sure this is what
you are thinking about.

588
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,843
It's because you won't live.

589
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:09,905
When we are at the border..

590
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,043
...our enemy shoots
us and we shoot them.

591
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:16,638
This is what generally happens.

592
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:23,774
One day,
in our camp, a man named Ashraf..

593
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:25,609
He was from Sholapur.

594
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:29,079
He just disappeared suddenly.

595
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:33,077
Even after searching for seven days,
we couldn't find him.

596
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:34,945
We found him on the eighth day.

597
00:41:35,234 --> 00:41:37,180
He was stuck at the enemy camp.

598
00:41:38,267 --> 00:41:41,544
They tortured him for seven days.

599
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:44,805
They had gouged out his eyes.

600
00:41:45,034 --> 00:41:48,948
They shoved a beer
bottle into his rare.

601
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,808
And then, they broke that bottle.

602
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,109
They were very cruel to him.

603
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:01,106
We had taken his
dead body to his house.

604
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,002
His mother was crying

605
00:42:04,533 --> 00:42:06,774
and father was wailing.

606
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:09,738
His sister was screaming, yelling..

607
00:42:11,034 --> 00:42:13,480
His family was in a very bad state.

608
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,911
But on the tenth day,

609
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:20,842
his younger brother
joined the military.

610
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,676
We die at the border even/day.

611
00:42:25,934 --> 00:42:28,540
...so that you can live
peacefully with your families.

612
00:42:35,234 --> 00:42:38,738
This is a locally made gun.

613
00:42:43,034 --> 00:42:45,105
This is my gun.

614
00:42:50,867 --> 00:42:53,040
If I shoot you,

615
00:42:54,067 --> 00:42:57,913
I'll have to tell
everyone why I did so.

616
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:02,616
Your family will express
their disgust over your dead body.

617
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,140
Your kids will beg at the signal.

618
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,671
Your wife will sell herself
on the streets at night.

619
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:18,008
And if you shoot yourself, it will
be considered as on-duty suicide.

620
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,845
Someone from your
family will get a job.

621
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:24,505
They will get the
provident fund money.

622
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,544
Pension will reach
home every month, on time.

623
00:43:27,834 --> 00:43:32,874
Now you decide which
gun do you wish to pick.

624
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,878
And yes,

625
00:43:34,934 --> 00:43:40,077
if the barrel of this gun points
towards me then I'll shoot you.

626
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:04,680
You are challenging
a very big threat.

627
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,073
A shot was fired.
- The sound came from the terrace.

628
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:15,610
I think from over there.
- From the terrace.

629
00:44:45,734 --> 00:44:50,410
I know that you and the
ACP don't know everything.

630
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,441
'Juhu. Bandra. Dharavi..'

631
00:47:26,534 --> 00:47:29,208
'Dadar. Bombay central.'

632
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,240
'Blasts at 12 places in Mumbai.'

633
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:45,145
When?

634
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,508
On 27th.

635
00:47:47,667 --> 00:47:48,873
Time?

636
00:47:49,134 --> 00:47:51,239
4:00pm.

637
00:49:07,334 --> 00:49:09,575
Looking beautiful?
- Very beautiful.

638
00:49:09,767 --> 00:49:11,576
Came from Jalandhar and
made a Maharashtrian fall for her.

639
00:49:11,634 --> 00:49:13,341
Really!
- She is very smart!

640
00:49:15,234 --> 00:49:17,077
He is naive.

641
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,508
You're looking gorgeous.

642
00:49:27,567 --> 00:49:29,444
Thank you so much. - Congratulations.

643
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,776
Hi.
- Thank you so much.

644
00:49:32,434 --> 00:49:34,004
Thanks for coming.

645
00:49:34,067 --> 00:49:35,171
Listen..

646
00:49:35,367 --> 00:49:37,176
Listen!
- What?

647
00:49:37,467 --> 00:49:39,606
Come with me. I have doubt.

648
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:41,471
Doubt?

649
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,702
Do you think this
is a mathematical class?

650
00:49:44,634 --> 00:49:47,376
Come with me.
I need to ask you something.

651
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,305
Please try to understand,
I am getting married.

652
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:51,471
After some time.

653
00:49:51,767 --> 00:49:54,714
Listen, my head will explode
if you won't come with me.

654
00:49:54,767 --> 00:49:56,075
Come with me, now!

655
00:49:56,134 --> 00:49:59,411
Let's see. I have plans but..

656
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:00,445
Excuse me.

657
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,537
Can you please hold this? Let's go.

658
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:06,003
Congratulations.

659
00:50:06,334 --> 00:50:07,369
What!

660
00:50:07,534 --> 00:50:10,640
The college beauty
contest that I won..

661
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,476
You lost but you were
the second runner up.

662
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,570
Okay. Continue.

663
00:50:15,634 --> 00:50:19,480
You have Hrithik, John and
Salman's posters in your hostel room.

664
00:50:19,534 --> 00:50:20,706
So what?

665
00:50:22,233 --> 00:50:24,543
Then why are you getting
married to this baldy?

666
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,547
Look, there are no
more than 10 film stars.

667
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:30,671
But there are 30
crores girls in India.

668
00:50:31,034 --> 00:50:32,604
So think practically.

669
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:35,375
The good looking guys aren't smart

670
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:37,379
And the smart ones don't look good.

671
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:38,708
Listen..

672
00:50:39,234 --> 00:50:42,511
And what about those who
are smart and good looking?

673
00:50:42,567 --> 00:50:46,174
Beg, plead and get married to him.

674
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:48,044
<i>30"'!-</i>

675
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,077
Howzat!

676
00:50:55,634 --> 00:50:58,706
What's troubling you, Makiya?

677
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:01,669
There's something
that I cannot understand.

678
00:51:01,967 --> 00:51:04,573
Try me. I might be able to help.

679
00:51:06,134 --> 00:51:09,138
In spite of being a cop,
I cannot understand.

680
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,173
How will you understand?

681
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,044
Why? I am a militan/ man.

682
00:51:14,434 --> 00:51:17,142
Do you know the basic difference
between a cop and a military man?

683
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,474
What?

684
00:51:19,067 --> 00:51:20,102
As soon as someone
says “Attention!”..

685
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,680
A military man stands stiff,
like this.

686
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,477
When he gets shoot orders,
he starts firing without thinking.

687
00:51:26,534 --> 00:51:28,172
But it's not so with us.

688
00:51:28,234 --> 00:51:29,975
We need to use our brains.

689
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:33,446
I mean if we need to catch a
pickpocket, we need to think like one.

690
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,481
If we need to catch a murderer,
we need to think like one.

691
00:51:36,634 --> 00:51:37,612
And if we need to catch a terrorist.

692
00:51:37,667 --> 00:51:39,146
You need to think like one.

693
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,271
No, you sometimes need
to become a terrorist.

694
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:42,073
Oh, my God.

695
00:51:42,134 --> 00:51:44,136
But in this case, even a
cop's brain has stopped working.

696
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:45,474
Then how can you help me?

697
00:51:45,534 --> 00:51:49,277
Still, try me. I'll try to
solve this to be best of my ability.

698
00:51:49,334 --> 00:51:51,473
Tell me. What's the problem?

699
00:51:52,033 --> 00:51:52,636
Fine. It goes like this.

700
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,701
The terrorist escaped
from the hospital.

701
00:51:53,967 --> 00:51:54,468
He did.

702
00:51:54,534 --> 00:51:57,606
That very night a cop
committed suicide in his house.

703
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:02,207
That cop was posted at the hospital
from where the terrorist escaped.

704
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:08,038
Now these two incidents are related,
this is what a cop thinks.

705
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,610
Now tell me what
a military man thinks.

706
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,908
I think this isn't a suicide,
it's a murder.

707
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,239
How can you say that?

708
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,075
Because I committed this murder.

709
00:52:23,034 --> 00:52:24,104
Why did you do it?

710
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:26,645
Why did he help that terrorist
escape from the hospital?

711
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,039
Escape from the hospital.

712
00:52:29,534 --> 00:52:30,535
How do you know that?

713
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,170
The terrorist told me.

714
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:35,539
Where did you find the terrorist?

715
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,511
That day in the hospital, you..

716
00:52:38,267 --> 00:52:39,211
What?

717
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,608
hospital.

718
00:52:43,433 --> 00:52:44,207
Hey!

719
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:44,971
Hi.

720
00:52:45,034 --> 00:52:46,206
What are you..
- Hi.

721
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:51,108
Can we talk...?

722
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,605
You don't..

723
00:53:00,933 --> 00:53:01,911
Yes?

724
00:53:04,067 --> 00:53:05,444
Can I marry you?

725
00:53:05,467 --> 00:53:06,810
Marriage?

726
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,108
When did you get that idea?

727
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:10,840
This morning. 8:40am.

728
00:53:10,967 --> 00:53:12,275
What happened at 8:40am?

729
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:13,812
My friend got married.

730
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:16,074
The most beautiful
girl in the college.

731
00:53:16,134 --> 00:53:19,172
But the guy she is getting married
to is not at all good looking.

732
00:53:19,267 --> 00:53:21,440
So, I asked her,
why is she getting married to him?

733
00:53:21,534 --> 00:53:25,107
She said sometimes
some things don't match.

734
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,947
And you know how difficult
it is to find a good guy these days.

735
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,479
So my friends too advised me..

736
00:53:31,534 --> 00:53:34,378
And I thought that
why won't we get married!

737
00:53:34,567 --> 00:53:36,808
I hope you very well know
that from the very beginning..

738
00:53:36,867 --> 00:53:39,313
...nothing seems to
match between you and me.

739
00:53:39,934 --> 00:53:43,472
First I rejected you
then you rejected me.

740
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:45,808
Now you are giving your consent.
- I am just saying yes.

741
00:53:45,867 --> 00:53:47,972
Yes, but nothing matches. Right?

742
00:53:48,867 --> 00:53:50,210
Do you smoke cigarettes?

743
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:52,410
Smoking?

744
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,275
Yuck, I don't do all that.

745
00:53:54,467 --> 00:53:56,310
Anyway, it's not allowed in boxing.

746
00:53:56,334 --> 00:53:59,804
Saw? But I like girls who smoke.

747
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:02,936
I like the fragrance of tobacco.

748
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,809
Oh yes..

749
00:54:05,334 --> 00:54:07,405
It's not like I have never done it.

750
00:54:07,467 --> 00:54:10,380
Sometimes, you know, girls, parties..

751
00:54:10,467 --> 00:54:11,912
It happens.

752
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,170
Nice. Nice.

753
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:14,405
Do you drink?

754
00:54:14,733 --> 00:54:16,212
Drinks? Alcohol?

755
00:54:17,067 --> 00:54:18,774
Yes, red wine.

756
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:21,212
You know, good for the head,
good for the skin.

757
00:54:21,267 --> 00:54:23,338
Sometimes even vodka!

758
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:29,304
But I hate girls who drink.

759
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:34,443
I just cannot bear the
sight of girls drinking.

760
00:54:34,767 --> 00:54:36,838
I can't understand why do they drink?

761
00:54:37,334 --> 00:54:38,904
Why are you crying?

762
00:54:40,367 --> 00:54:43,007
You are saying this on purpose.

763
00:54:43,067 --> 00:54:44,910
On purpose?
- I know that you love me.

764
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,913
Saiba..
Saiba, listen to me. I...l..

765
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:48,775
You..

766
00:54:48,834 --> 00:54:50,905
I came here straight
from the wedding.

767
00:54:51,067 --> 00:54:53,809
I didn't even eat!
- I'll feed you.

768
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,777
I am just joking!
- Joking?

769
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,745
I am just joking, come on!

770
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,437
If you don't believe me then let's go
to the temple outside and get married.

771
00:55:01,267 --> 00:55:04,214
But there's a problem.

772
00:55:05,367 --> 00:55:07,040
Now what's the problem?

773
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,339
Because I was angry with you“.

774
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:14,748
I said okay to the next
boy my parents introduced me to.

775
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,074
You said okay?

776
00:55:17,134 --> 00:55:21,446
Yes, it's not a big deal
to say okay and then say not okay.

777
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,873
But you said okay to him and
then you said the same okay to me.

778
00:55:23,934 --> 00:55:26,312
No, no, no.
The okay I said to you is different.

779
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,175
The okay I said to him is different.

780
00:55:28,234 --> 00:55:30,407
He too is a military man.

781
00:55:31,067 --> 00:55:32,102
A military man?

782
00:55:32,267 --> 00:55:36,272
If we somehow convince him
not to go ahead with this marriage..

783
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:37,438
Then our job will be done.

784
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:40,043
He'll be at the coffee
shop at 12 o'clock.

785
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,141
Let's do one thing.

786
00:55:43,034 --> 00:55:44,069
Let me accompany you.

787
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:45,043
Let's meet him.

788
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,272
You'll come with me?

789
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:51,075
He is going to come over here?

790
00:55:51,267 --> 00:55:53,269
Yes. Please wait here.

791
00:55:53,334 --> 00:55:54,278
Okay.

792
00:55:58,667 --> 00:56:01,307
Stay here,
I'll go inside and talk to him.

793
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:04,670
You stay here.
I'll go and talk to him.

794
00:56:04,734 --> 00:56:06,805
Come inside when I ask you to.

795
00:56:15,867 --> 00:56:17,107
Excuse me..

796
00:56:17,334 --> 00:56:19,746
Excuse me, the gentleman
with the flower. Please turn around.

797
00:56:19,767 --> 00:56:20,245
Turn.

798
00:56:20,367 --> 00:56:21,345
Yeah?

799
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:24,368
Sir!

800
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,047
LC58664,
Captain Virat reporting, sir!

801
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,774
Virat!

802
00:56:32,834 --> 00:56:34,040
What's going on?

803
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,009
You gave such a salute to me

804
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,807
that I felt as if I
am on the parade ground.

805
00:56:38,834 --> 00:56:40,040
I am sorry, sir.

806
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:46,748
The girl I am going to
marry is coming here to meet me.

807
00:56:47,734 --> 00:56:50,112
I have never been married before.

808
00:56:50,267 --> 00:56:51,746
It's my first time.

809
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,905
I am a little nervous.

810
00:56:58,934 --> 00:56:59,742
Hi...

811
00:57:05,134 --> 00:57:06,306
How are you?

812
00:57:06,734 --> 00:57:07,804
Stupid!

813
00:57:08,034 --> 00:57:09,012
<i>'.</i>

814
00:57:14,634 --> 00:57:16,079
How do I say it?

815
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,542
Hi.

816
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,204
Hi.

817
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,146
Hi! Come, come, come. Sit, sit, sit.

818
00:57:33,234 --> 00:57:36,841
You too like me,
that's what your mother told me.

819
00:57:46,934 --> 00:57:48,038
Thank you.

820
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:50,810
Sorry. Saiba, Virat.

821
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:52,603
We are in the same battalion.

822
00:57:52,734 --> 00:57:53,838
He is very junior to me.

823
00:57:53,867 --> 00:57:54,868
Okay.

824
00:57:54,934 --> 00:57:57,778
He keeps on making mistakes
and hence keeps getting punished.

825
00:57:57,834 --> 00:57:59,643
He is very scared of me.

826
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:00,502
Virat..

827
00:58:00,567 --> 00:58:02,137
Sir! - Saiba.

828
00:58:02,767 --> 00:58:04,075
Hello, madam.

829
00:58:04,134 --> 00:58:05,135
Madam?

830
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:08,243
I've kept a get-together
at the hotel in the evening.

831
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,241
A small party, you see.
- Oh.

832
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:12,741
You must come.

833
00:58:13,534 --> 00:58:14,103
Yeah.

834
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:16,807
Virat..
- I'll be there, sir. Thank you.

835
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:20,141
Now, it's 12:30pm.

836
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:22,673
We were going to meet 12 o'clock.

837
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,509
<i>30"'!-</i>

838
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,537
I'm very punctual.
I'm a military man, you see.

839
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,738
Of course.

840
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,907
So, we'll meet at
the party in the evening?

841
00:58:32,067 --> 00:58:33,478
Yes.

842
00:58:35,534 --> 00:58:37,536
Virat..
- Yes, sir! IC58..

843
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:42,645
Not in a public place.
See you in the evening.

844
00:58:42,734 --> 00:58:43,769
Sorry, sir.

845
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:47,039
Bye-bye.

846
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,477
Bye.

847
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:54,739
Virat!

848
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:55,811
Sir!

849
00:58:55,933 --> 00:58:57,571
Is this how you were going to talk?

850
00:58:57,633 --> 00:59:02,173
Sorry, madam, but you are
going to get married to him.

851
00:59:02,867 --> 00:59:05,177
He left. Why are you
addressing me as madam?

852
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,537
We love each other, don't we?

853
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,580
We broke up.

854
00:59:09,634 --> 00:59:12,547
We started loving just an hour back.
Already break up?

855
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,604
Look madam,
he is better than me in everything.

856
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,538
Do you know?

857
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:21,543
To complete a 400meter
race I take 52 seconds.

858
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,807
He takes 48 seconds.

859
00:59:24,434 --> 00:59:27,142
In high jump..
You know I can jump 6 feet high.

860
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,710
He jumps 6 feet 4 inches high.

861
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:32,642
In long jump,
I hold a record of 7 meters.

862
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,077
He has a record of 7.4.

863
00:59:34,134 --> 00:59:35,613
In weight lifting he..

864
00:59:35,767 --> 00:59:37,940
Am I selecting
candidates for military?

865
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,877
I don't like him. That's it.

866
00:59:39,967 --> 00:59:42,914
You didn't like me when
we met for the first time, right?

867
00:59:43,034 --> 00:59:44,741
Then you started liking me,
didn't you?

868
00:59:44,867 --> 00:59:47,541
You met him for the first time today,
so you don't like him.

869
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,705
You will like him in near future.

870
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:51,842
That was different
and this is different.

871
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,177
He is my senior and I'll
have to give this sacrifice.

872
00:59:55,433 --> 00:59:57,606
And I am the only
thing you can sacrifice?

873
00:59:57,767 --> 00:59:59,178
Your phone's ringing.

874
00:59:59,534 --> 01:00:00,877
It's yours.

875
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,139
Smart!

876
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:06,874
Hello?

877
01:00:06,933 --> 01:00:11,439
Tell me, where did
you meet that terrorist?

878
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,808
I'll tell you that later.

879
01:00:13,434 --> 01:00:16,472
We need to do something
important tomorrow. Okay?

880
01:00:17,067 --> 01:00:18,137
Hey, Vi..

881
01:00:19,667 --> 01:00:20,645
Strange!

882
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:34,969
What are you doing over here?

883
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,871
Don't you know why I am here?

884
01:00:39,467 --> 01:00:41,469
Don't ever come to
my room unannounced.

885
01:00:41,567 --> 01:00:44,138
There's something called as privacy.

886
01:00:46,433 --> 01:00:49,903
Once again I ask you,
where did you meet that terrorist?

887
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,510
Here.

888
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,168
Hey..

889
01:00:57,834 --> 01:00:59,973
He ran away from the hospital.

890
01:01:00,034 --> 01:01:01,570
How did you catch him?

891
01:01:01,634 --> 01:01:03,443
You remember we went to the hospital?

892
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,003
Then you went to sleep,
but I stayed back.

893
01:01:06,067 --> 01:01:08,013
I knew he would do something.

894
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,877
Hey, but..

895
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,104
You cannot keep him like this.

896
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:13,744
You'll have to hand
him over to the police.

897
01:01:13,933 --> 01:01:15,742
So that he can once again run away?

898
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,607
No. But we'll find out how many
people are working with him and..

899
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:21,907
Let that to me.

900
01:01:21,967 --> 01:01:24,345
Why are you injecting him with this?

901
01:01:25,467 --> 01:01:27,071
Say something.

902
01:01:27,734 --> 01:01:29,805
Why are you untying him?

903
01:01:33,534 --> 01:01:33,909
Virat!

904
01:01:33,967 --> 01:01:36,345
What...? What's going on?

905
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,402
You ask too many questions!

906
01:01:38,467 --> 01:01:39,946
And you are answering none of them!

907
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,502
Will someone tell
me what's happening here?

908
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:42,944
What have you injected him with?

909
01:01:43,034 --> 01:01:45,378
Nothing. It's just Ketamine.

910
01:01:45,434 --> 01:01:47,436
He will remain unconscious
for two hours. That's it.

911
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,672
And where are you
going wearing this coat?

912
01:01:48,733 --> 01:01:49,905
I'm going to attend a wedding.

913
01:01:50,934 --> 01:01:51,935
<i>Wedding f?</i>

914
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,443
My batch-mate is getting married.

915
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,943
What will you do over here?
You are free, so come along.

916
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,104
Come with me.

917
01:01:57,334 --> 01:01:58,642
You'll get free food. Come with me.

918
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,604
But you have untied
his hands and legs!

919
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:01,874
Let's go.

920
01:02:01,933 --> 01:02:03,503
Yes, man. What do I tell you!

How's everyone at home?
- Yes. Fine. All well.

922
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,405
Sister-in-law is fine too.
My son has started going to school.

923
01:02:08,467 --> 01:02:09,377
Hi, guys.

924
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,876

We are getting late. Hurry up.

927
01:02:16,634 --> 01:02:17,635
Everyone has been waiting for you.

928
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,678
Hi! Hi!

929
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:22,374

You are looking very smart!
- Thank you. - How are you?

934
01:02:39,767 --> 01:02:42,839
What about your marriage?
I heard something went wrong.

935
01:02:43,267 --> 01:02:44,837
Yes, there was confusion
during our first meeting.

936
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,470
So we broke it off. What do I say?

937
01:02:48,467 --> 01:02:49,571
Who is he?

938
01:02:49,634 --> 01:02:51,511
Oh, he.. I forgot.

939
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,875
He's my friend..

940
01:02:52,933 --> 01:02:54,310
Yes, Mukund Deshmukh.

941
01:02:54,367 --> 01:02:55,675

01:02:55,734 --> 01:02:57,372
Bandra East.

Yes. With God's help.

945
01:03:03,234 --> 01:03:04,338
Sarah..
- Yes?

946
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,903
Will you take Joel

947
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:08,503
Yes. With God's help.

948
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,972
What's the hum]?
- Look at the time..

949
01:03:21,234 --> 01:03:23,475
Guys, the bridegroom is calling you.

950
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:24,568
Come, guys.

951
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:25,935
Come and join us.

952
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,770
Let's go. He is calling us.

953
01:03:27,834 --> 01:03:28,869
Congratulations.

Your love story was successful.

955
01:03:30,534 --> 01:03:32,207
Hi, Virat.
Hi, Siddhanh.

956
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:33,337
Let's get a group photograph clicked.

957
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,538
Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Congratulations, Sarah.

958
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,635
Thank you so much.

959
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,907
You will know once you go there?

960
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:45,571
What are you doing?

961
01:03:45,633 --> 01:03:46,873
Alright, GUYS-

962
01:03:47,567 --> 01:03:48,739
He's saying something.
- Listen. Listen.

963
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,904
Virat is saying something.

964
01:03:50,334 --> 01:03:51,813
It's been a long time.

965
01:03:52,334 --> 01:03:53,574
Let's play a game. What do you say?

966
01:03:53,634 --> 01:03:54,510
A game?

967
01:03:54,567 --> 01:03:55,671
Come on, man!

968
01:03:55,867 --> 01:03:58,814
He wants to play games in the camp,
when the train stops.

969
01:03:58,867 --> 01:04:01,143
And now even at a wedding,
he wants to play a game.

970
01:04:01,267 --> 01:04:02,405
This is a real game.

971
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:03,571
Real game?!

972
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,174
Yes.

973
01:04:05,233 --> 01:04:07,873
Fine, then the six of us will be
one team and you six be the other.

974
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,208
What do you say?

975
01:04:09,234 --> 01:04:10,679
All of us are in one team.

976
01:04:10,767 --> 01:04:11,802
All of us in one team?
- Yes.

977
01:04:11,867 --> 01:04:13,175
There is no opponent?

978
01:04:13,234 --> 01:04:14,338
But what are the rules?

979
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,606
I'll tell that later.

980
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:17,874
Fine. But after winning,
you'll give all of us a party.

981
01:04:18,134 --> 01:04:19,875
Yes. - Yes.
- You'll have to give a party.

982
01:04:20,134 --> 01:04:21,135
Okay.

983
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:24,713
Okay, let's go.

984
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,309
Guys, pay attention.

985
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,575
This is a little serious game.

986
01:04:34,834 --> 01:04:39,180
You will soon know
who our opponents are.

987
01:04:41,267 --> 01:04:42,712
Can you see my house?

988
01:04:43,134 --> 01:04:44,204
Look at it very carefully.

989
01:04:44,267 --> 01:04:47,771
In two minutes, a guy will
come out from the backdoor.

990
01:04:48,434 --> 01:04:50,380
The 12 of us will follow him.

991
01:04:50,567 --> 01:04:51,443
Understood?
- Yes.

992
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:56,848
After that when he meets another person
we team will get divided into two.

993
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,279
Six people will follow the
guy who will just come outside.

994
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:03,474
And six people will
follow the guy he meets.

995
01:05:03,534 --> 01:05:08,415
As these people keep meeting different
people, our keep will keep getting divided.

996
01:05:08,467 --> 01:05:10,140
Did you all understand?
- Yes.

997
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,201
Very good.

998
01:05:11,267 --> 01:05:15,147
Remember,
your cell phones should always be on.

999
01:05:16,234 --> 01:05:18,339
Don't answer anyone's
call except mine.

1000
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,707
We 12 will have a conference
call and stay connected.

1001
01:05:20,767 --> 01:05:22,337
Okay?
- Yes. - Okay.

1002
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,243
Let's wait for the man now.

1003
01:05:24,434 --> 01:05:25,674
He'll be here soon.

1004
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,638
Is that him?
- That's the guy. Yeah.

1005
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,273
This is very risky.

1006
01:05:48,067 --> 01:05:50,104
It will be more risky
if we don't do anything.

1007
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:52,438
Stan the car and follow him.

1008
01:06:06,167 --> 01:06:07,669
Where did he go?
- He was just here.

1009
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,639
Where is he? We've lost him.

1010
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,701
Where is he?
- There he is!

1011
01:06:12,734 --> 01:06:14,304
Over there. Over there.

1012
01:06:18,367 --> 01:06:19,471
Drive slowly.

1013
01:06:19,734 --> 01:06:21,111
He got into a rickshaw.

1014
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:22,407
Vishal, note the number.

1015
01:06:23,067 --> 01:06:26,071
M I-I-O3-AA-6221 .

1016
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:40,669
He's accomplice is here. Look..

1017
01:06:40,734 --> 01:06:42,270
Drive slowly.

1018
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:46,543
What will we do if those
12 people don't split up?

1019
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,547
They will have to, because
they a job to finish at 12 places.

1020
01:06:50,734 --> 01:06:52,179
Stop the car.

1021
01:06:53,334 --> 01:06:55,177
Come on, boys.
- Come, come, come.

1022
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,172
You all six.. Follow him.

1023
01:07:12,234 --> 01:07:13,611
Let's go. Move.

1024
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:18,940
We are following him.

1025
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,506
Keep following him.

1026
01:07:21,567 --> 01:07:22,602
Copy that.

1027
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,474
Move. Move.

1028
01:07:28,967 --> 01:07:30,275
Stay on the line.

1029
01:07:34,034 --> 01:07:35,035
He's meeting another guy.

1030
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,374
Stay alert Stay alert

1031
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,206

We are following.

Copy that.

You follow him.

1035
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:52,468
How many so far?

1036
01:07:52,534 --> 01:07:54,343
We are following the first guy.
- We are following the second guy.

1037
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,276
We are following the new one.

1038
01:07:55,334 --> 01:07:56,540
Keep following.

1039
01:08:03,434 --> 01:08:05,311
He's walking right in front of me.

1040
01:08:05,634 --> 01:08:07,477
Stay alert
- Copy that.

1041
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:11,141
Virat, we are following
the first guy.

1042
01:08:12,933 --> 01:08:14,503
Another guy has joined.

1043
01:08:23,434 --> 01:08:24,572
Get in the train.

1044
01:08:27,234 --> 01:08:28,474
We are in the train.

1045
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,536
Virat, they are splitting up.

1046
01:08:52,367 --> 01:08:53,641
Stay there.

1047
01:09:02,867 --> 01:09:04,073
Okay. Well done.

1048
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,073
Virat, Goregaon Station.

1049
01:09:07,267 --> 01:09:08,871
Wait for the high point.

1050
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:11,877
The first guy is meeting
a cell phone dealer.

1051
01:09:14,467 --> 01:09:15,878
Now they are separate.

1052
01:09:16,134 --> 01:09:17,340
You follow him.

1053
01:09:20,534 --> 01:09:21,911
He's meeting another guy.

1054
01:09:21,967 --> 01:09:23,844
All of you split. Split now!

01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,311
They are splitting up.

You follow him.
Stay connected.

1057
01:09:47,034 --> 01:09:48,377
It's target at sight.

1058
01:09:57,267 --> 01:09:58,803
I'm following the new one.

1059
01:09:58,867 --> 01:10:00,175
There is one for each of us now.

1060
01:10:00,234 --> 01:10:01,269
Virat, I'm at Dockyard Road.

1061
01:10:01,367 --> 01:10:02,402
Masjid Bandar.

1062
01:10:02,467 --> 01:10:03,844
I'm getting into a fern].

1063
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:05,344
I'm at Dharavi.

1064
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:07,373
I'm at Matunga.

1065
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,106
Virat, he has gotten into a bus.

1066
01:10:12,534 --> 01:10:14,377
He's getting inside a mall.
- Yes.

1067
01:10:15,267 --> 01:10:16,473
I'm right behind him.

1068
01:10:16,534 --> 01:10:17,410
I'm at Bandra.

1069
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:18,241
I'm in a fern].

1070
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:19,109
I'm at Chembur.

1071
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:20,237
I'm at Kurla.

1072
01:10:20,334 --> 01:10:24,441
Guys, we are 12 people
for those 12 guys.

1073
01:10:24,501 --> 01:10:26,105
The game is going to end now.

1074
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:27,908
I have kept something in your bags.

1075
01:10:27,967 --> 01:10:29,173
Check it out.

1076
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:30,874
It's a gun.

1077
01:10:30,934 --> 01:10:32,345
Hey, it contains a gun.

1078
01:10:32,401 --> 01:10:33,812
It contains a gun.

1079
01:10:33,934 --> 01:10:35,242
Virat, this is a gun.

1080
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,211
No one needs to panic.

1081
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,174
I have placed that gun there.

1082
01:10:39,434 --> 01:10:42,210
There's a bomb in the bag
of the guy you are following.

1083
01:10:42,267 --> 01:10:44,304
He's not an ordinary guy.

1084
01:10:44,334 --> 01:10:47,907
He has killed innocent women
and children in our country.

1085
01:10:47,967 --> 01:10:49,878
He's a damn terrorist.

1086
01:10:49,934 --> 01:10:52,175
We need to do what
we do at the border.

1087
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,937
To keep a bomb at four
places at the same time..

1088
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:56,810
To cause serial blasts in train..

1089
01:10:56,867 --> 01:10:58,972
We too know their technique.

1090
01:10:59,034 --> 01:11:00,240
We need to show them that.

1091
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,837
There shouldn't be a
difference of even a second.

1092
01:11:02,901 --> 01:11:05,040
Shoot them at the same time.

1093
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,338
Ready, get set, boys.

1094
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,378
Yes.

1095
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:08,412
We will do it.

1096
01:11:08,467 --> 01:11:09,172
Yes.

1097
01:11:09,234 --> 01:11:10,406
We will do it.

1098
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,474
Three..

1099
01:11:22,467 --> 01:11:23,946
Two..

1100
01:11:25,867 --> 01:11:26,845
One..

1101
01:11:27,434 --> 01:11:28,242
Shoot!

1102
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,377
He's dead. I've left.

1103
01:12:01,334 --> 01:12:02,278
We'll do that.

1104
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,438
When are you giving us party?
- I will. I will.

1105
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:05,112
What have you done!
- Finished. End.

1106
01:12:09,934 --> 01:12:12,938
The dead body found at 11 places
and the one found here..

1107
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,377
They are sleeper cells.

1108
01:12:14,434 --> 01:12:17,313
They are even claimed
to be terrorists.

1109
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:19,404
They even found bombs in their bags.

1110
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:20,338
According to the police..

1111
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:24,280
All the cell phones found on
sleeper cells are of high technology.

1112
01:12:24,334 --> 01:12:27,110
Looking at the magnitude of the
preparations of these sleeper cells..

1113
01:12:27,167 --> 01:12:31,138
...one thing is for certain that Mumbai
has been saved from a major disaster.

1114
01:12:31,767 --> 01:12:35,738
At the moment the biggest threat
to this world are the sleeper cells.

1115
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,802
What are they? And who are they?

1116
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:41,712
Look, in a terrorist world,
these sleeper cells..

1117
01:12:41,734 --> 01:12:44,840
...are the one whose
activities are most secretive.

1118
01:12:44,934 --> 01:12:50,350
Like the 12 men who were
killed were kind of sleeper cells..

1119
01:12:50,434 --> 01:12:53,176
Yet they stayed
among the common man..

1120
01:12:53,234 --> 01:12:55,805
...and prepared
themselves for an attack.

1121
01:12:55,934 --> 01:12:58,175
The most important question.

1122
01:12:58,234 --> 01:13:01,681
Do these sleeper cells
belong to a particular religion?

1123
01:13:01,734 --> 01:13:05,341
It's not always that
they are related to religion.

1124
01:13:05,667 --> 01:13:10,013
When a country or a group want
to plan a terrorist in our country“

1125
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:18,178
They find people who hold a grudge,
a feeling of revenge towards the government.

1126
01:13:18,234 --> 01:13:24,981
These people are found and prepared to
execute a terrorist attack against us..

1127
01:13:25,034 --> 01:13:28,243
And seek their revenge.

1128
01:13:28,634 --> 01:13:35,244
After the 9/11 attack, all the secret
agencies had one thing in mind..

1129
01:13:35,367 --> 01:13:38,837
That they should rid
America of sleeper cells.

1130
01:13:38,967 --> 01:13:44,041
And they got rid of them in such
a way that after the 9/11 attack..

1131
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:49,880
...no attack of that kind or magnitude
took place again in America.

1132
01:13:50,234 --> 01:13:53,772
Navin Chandra, Age: 29,
killed in a BEST Bus.

1133
01:13:53,834 --> 01:13:57,873
Afsar Ali, Age: 31,
killed at the Mumbai Central ST Stand.

1134
01:13:58,034 --> 01:13:59,843
Mother, look father!

1135
01:14:00,601 --> 01:14:01,272
Mother!

1136
01:14:01,701 --> 01:14:04,204
Mother! Look father!

1137
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,310
Mother! Father's photo!

1138
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,874
Mother! Look father!

1139
01:14:10,934 --> 01:14:13,039
Mother! Look father!

1140
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,280
Look mother, father..

1141
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,973
Who did this?

1142
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:30,702
We still don't know who did it

1143
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,905
Even the police have no clue.

1144
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,304
Any clues?

1145
01:14:36,867 --> 01:14:39,575
Police has confiscated
all their things.

1146
01:14:40,034 --> 01:14:44,107
Just one non-tracker phone
has been taken by a shooter.

1147
01:14:47,067 --> 01:14:48,842
Whose phone was it?

1148
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:53,178
Afsar Ali, who got killed
at Mumbai Central, near the ST Stand.

1149
01:15:55,234 --> 01:15:58,181
I don't know who you are,
where you are.

1150
01:15:59,667 --> 01:16:02,443
You have killed 12 of my men.

1151
01:16:02,634 --> 01:16:05,740
One of them was my brother.

1152
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:08,578
I am coming to you.

1153
01:16:10,101 --> 01:16:13,742
When I find you, I'll kill you.

1154
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:17,707
I am waiting.

1155
01:17:24,367 --> 01:17:26,540
Hello. Please come.

1156
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,613
What's the height of this wall?

1157
01:18:43,667 --> 01:18:45,010
S ix feet.

1158
01:18:48,134 --> 01:18:50,273
They are excellent jumpers.

1159
01:18:53,567 --> 01:18:55,137
What was the speed of the bus?

1160
01:18:55,201 --> 01:18:57,340
Approximately 40km/hr.

1161
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:59,410
They are good runners as well.

1162
01:19:03,034 --> 01:19:05,105
They can swim well too.

1163
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:11,042
They have shot all the
12 people on their forehead.

1164
01:19:13,067 --> 01:19:17,311
A moving bus,
crowded market, dark theatre..

1165
01:19:17,967 --> 01:19:21,972
Even from a distance of 20 meters they
shot at the centre of the forehead.

1166
01:19:23,601 --> 01:19:25,103
They are trained shooters.

1167
01:19:27,567 --> 01:19:29,843
But they are not cops.

1168
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:34,844
Was there anything
common in these 12 people?

1169
01:19:35,434 --> 01:19:36,504
No.

1170
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,005
But there was one
thing common in them.

1171
01:19:41,067 --> 01:19:43,172
During enquin/ I found out

1172
01:19:43,367 --> 01:19:47,076
that these 12 people were
wearing suits while shooting.

1173
01:19:48,834 --> 01:19:49,574
What did you just say?

1174
01:19:49,934 --> 01:19:53,438
These 12 people were
wearing suits while shooting.

1175
01:19:54,501 --> 01:19:57,004
This is something you
should have told me sooner.

1176
01:19:57,067 --> 01:19:59,343
I thought it's very
common to wear suits.

1177
01:19:59,434 --> 01:20:05,612
It's very common to wear
suits in America, but not in India.

1178
01:20:09,834 --> 01:20:13,213
So they are people
who wear suit-pants.

1179
01:20:15,467 --> 01:20:18,141
They can be waiters in a hotel.

1180
01:20:19,034 --> 01:20:21,344
Businessmen attending a board meeting.

1181
01:20:23,134 --> 01:20:26,547
They can be software
engineers attending a seminar.

1182
01:20:27,434 --> 01:20:31,382
Advocates, marriage functions.

1183
01:20:35,301 --> 01:20:38,145
I need a list of all the seminars..

1184
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:41,374
...and marriage functions that
took place in Mumbai on the 27th.

1185
01:20:42,167 --> 01:20:45,444
The ones with dress code suit-pants.

1186
01:20:48,167 --> 01:20:50,078
You think you are very smart.

1187
01:20:50,234 --> 01:20:52,510
Instead of killing those 12 people
if you would've caught them alive..

1188
01:20:52,767 --> 01:20:54,178
...then we would've
got some information.

1189
01:20:54,334 --> 01:20:56,336
It's of no use.

1190
01:20:56,801 --> 01:20:59,145
Because they never
know what the plan is.

1191
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,838
What?
- Yes.

1192
01:21:01,134 --> 01:21:04,138
Those 12 people didn't
even know each other.

1193
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,474
What are you saying!

1194
01:21:05,934 --> 01:21:08,073
These people are called sleeper cells.

1195
01:21:08,334 --> 01:21:10,211
Whether you call them
their heads or bosses..

1196
01:21:10,234 --> 01:21:12,077
Can be one, two or three..

1197
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:13,905
They make the plan together.

1198
01:21:13,967 --> 01:21:18,177
And then they find people who
are ready to sacrifice their lives.

1199
01:21:18,234 --> 01:21:22,046
And the ones who are ready to sacrifice
their lives are called sleeper cells.

1200
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,477
That's why it's no use capturing them.

1201
01:21:23,534 --> 01:21:25,445
Because they don't know anything.

1202
01:21:26,767 --> 01:21:31,147
So till these sleeper cells don't get orders
from their boss they lead a normal life?

1203
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,304
Exactly.

1204
01:21:32,367 --> 01:21:34,745
We won't even know where they are.

1205
01:21:34,867 --> 01:21:36,369
It can be our neighbour.

1206
01:21:36,434 --> 01:21:38,710
Or the one sitting
next to us in a bus.

1207
01:21:38,767 --> 01:21:39,905
It can even be our courier boy.

1208
01:21:39,967 --> 01:21:40,945
It can be anyone.

1209
01:21:41,001 --> 01:21:42,947
So how do we destroy them?

1210
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,980
There's one way to destroy them.

1211
01:21:45,034 --> 01:21:48,140
Kill their head or boss.

1212
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:52,739
Once he is dead,
their connection shall end.

1213
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,406
And as the sleeper cells won't get
any orders, they'll become dormant.

1214
01:21:55,467 --> 01:21:58,812
Just a minute! But how will you
find the head of the sleeper cells?

1215
01:21:59,334 --> 01:22:00,972
Who said I will find him?

1216
01:22:01,034 --> 01:22:02,274
He will find me.

1217
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:04,439
What?
- Because of what I have done.

1218
01:22:05,301 --> 01:22:07,474
We killed 12 of his men..
- Yes.

1219
01:22:07,734 --> 01:22:11,341
He will surely attack
us to seek revenge.

1220
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,210
According to my plan,
he will soon show himself.

1221
01:22:17,234 --> 01:22:20,704
But in a big city like Mumbai,
how will he find you?

1222
01:22:23,134 --> 01:22:24,704
We killed his men?

1223
01:22:24,767 --> 01:22:25,302
Right.

1224
01:22:25,367 --> 01:22:27,040
We must've made some mistake.

1225
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,011
We must've left some clue behind.

1226
01:22:29,267 --> 01:22:31,338
He will come out to look for the clue.

1227
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:38,978
If we find out what that clue is
we can capture him before he attacks.

1228
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,373
Then get thinking
about what that clue is.

1229
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:44,375
Move that colourful thing..
What is it called?

1230
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:46,002
Cube?

1231
01:22:46,334 --> 01:22:49,975
Move the cube,
they will help you find out.

1232
01:22:50,267 --> 01:22:51,245
Right?

1233
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:53,669
Because if you have
left a clue behind..

1234
01:22:53,734 --> 01:22:55,236
You won't answer this call.

1235
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:58,747
No! Today you need to decide,
friend or girlfriend.

1236
01:22:59,167 --> 01:23:00,737
Girlfriend.
- Good..

1237
01:23:01,201 --> 01:23:01,975
Hello?

1238
01:23:02,034 --> 01:23:05,072
Your sir has summoned us to his house.
Right away.

1239
01:23:05,134 --> 01:23:06,112
Okay, I am coming.

1240
01:23:06,167 --> 01:23:08,306
Hurry up.
- Yes, I'm coming.

1241
01:23:08,367 --> 01:23:11,075
Virat! What are you doing?
Let's go inside..

1242
01:23:12,134 --> 01:23:13,272
Virat!

1243
01:23:23,134 --> 01:23:24,408
Jyoti..

1244
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,775
Remain seated. Sit.

1245
01:23:34,267 --> 01:23:36,247
She is Jyoti, my neighbour.

1246
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:37,574
Hi.

1247
01:23:38,267 --> 01:23:41,578
She has been in love
with me since childhood.

1248
01:23:42,067 --> 01:23:43,068
Sit.

1249
01:23:43,667 --> 01:23:47,342
After hearing the news that I
am going to get married to you, she..

1250
01:23:49,067 --> 01:23:50,705
She was going to commit suicide.

1251
01:23:50,767 --> 01:23:53,270
We got her hospitalised.
It was a big problem.

1252
01:23:53,667 --> 01:23:56,113
Then I decided..

1253
01:23:58,134 --> 01:24:00,910
I am sorry, I will marry Jyoti.

1254
01:24:03,301 --> 01:24:04,678
I know..

1255
01:24:06,034 --> 01:24:08,571
This must've come
to you as a huge shock.

1256
01:24:10,701 --> 01:24:14,672
I evoked love in your head,
I made a mistake.

1257
01:24:18,001 --> 01:24:20,277
No more suicides. Life is precious.

1258
01:24:22,634 --> 01:24:24,739
Now I have a question
for the two of you.

1259
01:24:24,801 --> 01:24:25,802
Yes, sir.

1260
01:24:25,834 --> 01:24:28,610
You came here on a holiday,
to get married.

1261
01:24:29,234 --> 01:24:29,939
Yes, sir.

1262
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,070
Here..

1263
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:34,874
And you wanted to
marry a military man?

1264
01:24:35,534 --> 01:24:36,274
Yes.

1265
01:24:36,734 --> 01:24:38,873
Why don't the two of you get married?

1266
01:24:40,201 --> 01:24:41,976
But sir..
- Virat!

1267
01:24:42,167 --> 01:24:43,271
Don't act suspicious..

1268
01:24:43,534 --> 01:24:46,105
I loved her, but I never touched her.

1269
01:24:46,867 --> 01:24:48,540
That's by mistake.

1270
01:24:48,934 --> 01:24:50,538
Ask her!

1271
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:58,009
Look, I can understand that
it won't be easy for you to forget me.

1272
01:24:59,167 --> 01:25:00,271
Now what can I do?

1273
01:25:00,534 --> 01:25:02,844
It's not my fault
that I am so handsome.

1274
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,675
Yes, sir!
- Strange guy.

1275
01:25:04,734 --> 01:25:07,146
He stands up for anything I say.

1276
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,273
Well, all the best.

1277
01:25:11,767 --> 01:25:13,144
Thank you, sir.

1278
01:25:13,234 --> 01:25:14,235
Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

1279
01:25:14,501 --> 01:25:15,138
Thank you.
- Bye.

1280
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,645
Come on, let's go.

1281
01:25:16,901 --> 01:25:18,107
Saiba..

1282
01:25:21,567 --> 01:25:22,170
Yeah?

1283
01:25:22,234 --> 01:25:24,510
Because we couldn't get married..

1284
01:25:26,767 --> 01:25:27,643
Never do this.

1285
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:28,804
<i>I'll m].</i>

1286
01:25:28,867 --> 01:25:30,107
All the best.

1287
01:25:31,467 --> 01:25:32,468
Let's go.

1288
01:25:32,534 --> 01:25:33,842
Hurry Up-

1289
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,445
Bye, sir.

1290
01:26:20,167 --> 01:26:23,671
“Friends,
this is the excuse to live life.”

1291
01:26:23,734 --> 01:26:27,045
“lf is this excuse happens to be old,
then so be it.”

1292
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,570
“The stars are naughty, let's love."

1293
01:26:30,634 --> 01:26:32,113
“Don't blame it on me."

1294
01:26:32,167 --> 01:26:33,874
“Just blame the night.”

1295
01:26:33,934 --> 01:26:37,472
“Let us shower some
spirits on the night.”

1296
01:26:37,534 --> 01:26:40,777
“Let us request it not to pass away.”

1297
01:26:40,834 --> 01:26:44,577
“Love is on, so just be mischievous.”

1298
01:26:44,634 --> 01:26:45,977
“Don't blame it on me."

1299
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,014
“Just blame the night.”

1300
01:26:48,067 --> 01:26:51,571
“Tonight.
- Let's just give into the feeling.”

1301
01:26:51,634 --> 01:26:53,045
“Blame the night.”

1302
01:26:53,101 --> 01:26:54,546
“Let's be shameless.”

1303
01:26:54,601 --> 01:26:56,137
“Blame the night.”

1304
01:26:56,434 --> 01:26:57,913
“Let's do something daft.”

1305
01:26:57,967 --> 01:27:00,914
“Blame the night.”

1306
01:27:00,967 --> 01:27:02,571
“Blame it on the night.”

1307
01:27:07,801 --> 01:27:10,042
“Do whatever you want
to do in this crazy mood..”

1308
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,579
“Don't be ashamed.”

1309
01:27:11,634 --> 01:27:15,081
“lfl pass out, don't blame me."

1310
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:18,638
“So just skip the modesty,
let's love."

1311
01:27:18,701 --> 01:27:20,203
“Don't blame it on me."

1312
01:27:20,467 --> 01:27:22,037
“Just blame the night.”

1313
01:27:22,101 --> 01:27:25,548
“Mix my desires with yours.”

1314
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,809
“Consume me a little and
you too get a little drunk.”

1315
01:27:28,867 --> 01:27:32,144
“Love is on, so just be mischievous.”

1316
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,845
“Don't blame it on me."

1317
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:36,107
“Just blame the night.”

1318
01:27:36,367 --> 01:27:38,938
“Tonight.
- Let's just give into the feeling.”

1319
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:40,943
“Blame the night.”

1320
01:27:41,034 --> 01:27:42,445
“Let's be shameless.”

1321
01:27:42,467 --> 01:27:43,878
“Blame the night.”

1322
01:27:44,034 --> 01:27:45,707
“Let's do something daft.”

1323
01:27:45,767 --> 01:27:47,872
“Blame the night.”

1324
01:27:47,934 --> 01:27:50,141
“Tonight. blame it on the night.”

1325
01:28:07,501 --> 01:28:14,419
“Let the intoxicating love take over.”

1326
01:28:14,467 --> 01:28:21,385
“Let more love get into the system.”

1327
01:28:21,434 --> 01:28:23,846
“Let this not end here."

1328
01:28:24,967 --> 01:28:27,379
“You can make me drink as you want.”

1329
01:28:27,767 --> 01:28:31,579
“Now there shall be no regrets,
tonight."

1330
01:28:32,667 --> 01:28:36,672
“Blame the night!”

1331
01:28:36,867 --> 01:28:40,314
“Blame the night!”

1332
01:28:40,367 --> 01:28:43,712
“Blame the night!”

1333
01:28:43,767 --> 01:28:47,613
“Blame the night!”

1334
01:28:47,667 --> 01:28:50,910
“Tonight.
- Let's just give into the feeling.”

1335
01:28:50,967 --> 01:28:52,913
“Blame the night.”

1336
01:28:52,967 --> 01:28:54,605
“Let's be shameless.”

1337
01:28:54,667 --> 01:28:56,476
“Blame the night.”

1338
01:28:56,534 --> 01:28:57,808
“Let's do something daft.”

1339
01:28:57,867 --> 01:28:59,869
“Blame the night.”

1340
01:29:00,867 --> 01:29:02,073
“Blame it on the night.”

1341
01:29:15,634 --> 01:29:16,442
What are you doing? What...?

1342
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,808
Where...? Where are you taking me?

1343
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,809
It's still..
the song is still playing.

1344
01:29:23,067 --> 01:29:25,013
“Blame the night.”

1345
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:27,005
What's wrong?

1346
01:29:27,667 --> 01:29:28,702
Are you okay?

1347
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:34,343
Your body temperature seems high.

1348
01:29:35,567 --> 01:29:38,343
Today is our first date so..

1349
01:29:38,767 --> 01:29:39,905
You know the rules.

1350
01:29:39,967 --> 01:29:44,313
According to that you need to give
your boyfriend whatever he asks for.

1351
01:29:44,634 --> 01:29:46,272
That's why I am a little scared.

1352
01:29:46,334 --> 01:29:48,245
But I don't want anything.

1353
01:29:48,334 --> 01:29:49,574
You brought me to such a nice club.

1354
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:51,238
You spent a lot of money.

1355
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:53,246
I am okay. I am happy.
Come on, let's dance.

1356
01:29:53,301 --> 01:29:54,439
Idiot.

1357
01:29:54,534 --> 01:29:56,844
Suppose if you had asked
for a kiss on our first date!

1358
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,607
I would have to kiss you, right?

1359
01:30:05,634 --> 01:30:06,977
Yes, you will have to kiss me.

1360
01:30:07,234 --> 01:30:10,545
Saw? This is what I feared.

1361
01:30:11,434 --> 01:30:12,811
I want a kiss.

1362
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:15,846
So, what should I do now?

1363
01:30:16,334 --> 01:30:17,972
Nothing, just close your eyes.

1364
01:30:18,267 --> 01:30:19,803
I'll do whatever needs to be done.

1365
01:30:42,534 --> 01:30:43,774
Damn..

1366
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:47,445
Yes?

1367
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:48,375
Listen..

1368
01:30:48,434 --> 01:30:51,244
I found the clue which
he will use to find us.

1369
01:30:51,267 --> 01:30:52,268
What?

1370
01:30:55,167 --> 01:30:57,169
I'll find out everything. Okay?

1371
01:30:58,167 --> 01:30:59,202
Hey..

1372
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:01,743
Idiot.

1373
01:31:04,801 --> 01:31:07,611
But how will he know
we left from the church?

1374
01:31:08,201 --> 01:31:11,307
There was just one similarity
in the shootout of those 12 people.

1375
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,275
And that's their dress-code.

1376
01:31:14,201 --> 01:31:17,842
If he is very smart,
he will come straight to the church.

1377
01:31:31,534 --> 01:31:34,572
Of all the functions that
took place on the 27th in Mumbai..

1378
01:31:34,634 --> 01:31:37,706
...the wedding in this church is the
only event that matches with our list.

1379
01:31:38,234 --> 01:31:40,680
Because the one who got
married is a military man.

1380
01:31:42,801 --> 01:31:44,212
Yes?

1381
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:51,477
The name of the bridegroom
is William Maﬂin Joel.

1382
01:31:52,401 --> 01:31:54,108
Can we get his address?

1383
01:31:54,167 --> 01:31:55,373
Yes.
- Please.

1384
01:32:01,267 --> 01:32:02,405
Yes?

1385
01:32:02,534 --> 01:32:04,741
Joel's residence?
- Yes.

1386
01:32:04,867 --> 01:32:07,279
We are from the army.
His batch mates.

1387
01:32:07,501 --> 01:32:10,345
Okay! Come, come, come.

1388
01:32:11,134 --> 01:32:12,374
Joel is on honeymoon.

1389
01:32:12,434 --> 01:32:13,708
Did you contact him on his mobile?

1390
01:32:13,767 --> 01:32:15,440
His phone was out of reach, uncle.

1391
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,741
Oh! Hill station. I am sorry.

1392
01:32:17,801 --> 01:32:20,372
Come. She's Joel's mom.

1393
01:32:20,501 --> 01:32:22,447
She's cannot speak.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1394
01:32:22,467 --> 01:32:23,445
Come, sit.

1395
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:26,509
I have brought a gift for Joel.

1396
01:32:26,567 --> 01:32:29,138
Oh, thank you very much.
God bless you.

1397
01:32:30,134 --> 01:32:31,204
What will you have to drink?

1398
01:32:31,267 --> 01:32:32,803
No, thank you, uncle.

1399
01:32:35,767 --> 01:32:38,577
Uncle, can we have a
look at Joel's wedding album?

1400
01:32:38,634 --> 01:32:40,545
Why not! I'll just get it.

1401
01:32:43,434 --> 01:32:45,345
That's great, madam!

1402
01:32:45,567 --> 01:32:48,446
You will give the
address to any stranger?

1403
01:32:48,501 --> 01:32:52,176
Isn't it your duty to at
least call his family and inform?

1404
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:53,406
This isn't the time to argue.
Let's go. Hurry up.

1405
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:54,707
What do I say about.
- Let's get going.

1406
01:32:54,767 --> 01:32:56,747
No one is answering the
phone at their residence.

1407
01:32:58,767 --> 01:33:00,440
He's Joel's school teacher.

1408
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,443
And this is Joel's cousin.

1409
01:33:12,801 --> 01:33:14,712
They are Joel's batch-mates.

1410
01:33:35,067 --> 01:33:36,512
Uncle, there are five teams in this.

1411
01:33:36,567 --> 01:33:38,672
Yes, so far he has been to five camps.

1412
01:33:38,734 --> 01:33:40,509
That's why there are five teams.

1413
01:33:41,267 --> 01:33:42,337
Can I have a cup of coffee?

1414
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,347
Oh yes, sure. I'll just get it.

1415
01:33:48,167 --> 01:33:49,475
We got stuck at the last stage.

1416
01:33:49,534 --> 01:33:53,277
How will we know which
team out of these five?

1417
01:33:55,234 --> 01:33:56,542
I will find out.

1418
01:33:57,601 --> 01:33:59,547
Boys, here's your coffee.

1419
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,011
Thank you.

1420
01:34:13,434 --> 01:34:14,742
You returned so soon!

1421
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,173
I couldn't find that
medicine anywhere.

1422
01:34:18,067 --> 01:34:19,375
They are Joel's batch-mates.

1423
01:34:19,434 --> 01:34:20,538
They couldn't attend the wedding.

1424
01:34:20,601 --> 01:34:22,205
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

1425
01:34:22,234 --> 01:34:24,271
I'm Noel. Joel's brother.
- Hi.

1426
01:34:24,434 --> 01:34:25,037
Sit.

1427
01:34:25,101 --> 01:34:26,478
Dad, did you give
them coffee or something?

1428
01:34:26,534 --> 01:34:27,911
Yes.
- Oh great. Okay.

1429
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:30,307
Thanks for coming, guys.

1430
01:34:31,034 --> 01:34:33,275
In which camp was Joel with you?

1431
01:34:34,934 --> 01:34:36,038
Kashmir.

1432
01:34:37,034 --> 01:34:38,206
Which year?

1433
01:34:40,367 --> 01:34:41,675
2005.

1434
01:34:42,467 --> 01:34:45,937
Joel was in Delhi in 2005.

1435
01:34:46,201 --> 01:34:48,943
After that he never sewed in Kashmir.

1436
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,638
Can I see your ID cards?

1437
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:03,080
Can you show me your ID cards?

1438
01:35:05,634 --> 01:35:06,476
Show me.

1439
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:08,275
May I see your ID cards?

1440
01:35:08,467 --> 01:35:11,243
Dad! You are just too much!

1441
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:13,143
You just let anyone enter the house!

1442
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:13,678
What happened?

1443
01:35:13,934 --> 01:35:16,471
I asked them about work.
They don't know anything.

1444
01:35:16,534 --> 01:35:20,414
I hate smart people.

1445
01:35:30,967 --> 01:35:32,002
Show me!

1446
01:35:32,134 --> 01:35:33,112
Show me!

1447
01:35:38,567 --> 01:35:42,140
I need to leave a message for him.

1448
01:36:00,867 --> 01:36:03,245
They are smarter than I thought.

1449
01:36:22,367 --> 01:36:24,347
Why has these people circled?

1450
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:25,401
Look"

1451
01:36:26,334 --> 01:36:29,838
To find out which one team out
of these five shot those 12 people..

1452
01:36:29,901 --> 01:36:33,212
...he will pick one
member from each team.

1453
01:36:33,267 --> 01:36:36,146
And he has circled those he will pick.

1454
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,873
He is very smart.

1455
01:36:41,901 --> 01:36:42,504
Hello?

1456
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,602
Hi, I'm Captain Virat Bakshi here.

1457
01:36:45,067 --> 01:36:47,047
Look, I want to tell you something.

1458
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:50,172
According to our intelligence
report your life is in danger.

1459
01:36:50,234 --> 01:36:51,110
Are you safe?

1460
01:36:51,167 --> 01:36:52,612
Yes, I am okay.

1461
01:36:52,934 --> 01:36:53,935
Are you sure?

1462
01:36:54,067 --> 01:36:55,239
Yes, there's no problem.

1463
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:58,870
Please call me back on this
number if you face any problem.

1464
01:36:58,934 --> 01:37:00,106
Please note down this number.

1465
01:37:00,167 --> 01:37:01,271
Okay.

1466
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:06,903
Yes, Virat. I am fine.

1467
01:37:06,967 --> 01:37:08,002
Yes, I am safe.

1468
01:37:08,101 --> 01:37:09,307
Yes Virat, I am fine.

1469
01:37:09,401 --> 01:37:12,143
I'll surely call you
if there is any problem.

1470
01:37:13,534 --> 01:37:14,604
What?

1471
01:37:14,934 --> 01:37:16,971
All those who were circled are safe.

1472
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:22,037
That's the problem.

1473
01:37:22,867 --> 01:37:24,972
It's not as we thought.

1474
01:37:26,201 --> 01:37:29,239
That means they are
planning something else.

1475
01:37:30,234 --> 01:37:32,145
That can be dangerous.

1476
01:38:17,067 --> 01:38:19,104
Virat. Amar Singh here.

1477
01:38:19,367 --> 01:38:21,779
Someone has kidnapped my niece.

1478
01:38:22,767 --> 01:38:23,802
When?

1479
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:26,403
She went to the yoga class in the
morning, but still hasn't returned.

1480
01:38:26,767 --> 01:38:29,839
They took her saying that
we have sent a car from home.

1481
01:38:30,734 --> 01:38:32,873
File a complaint in your
area's police station immediately.

1482
01:38:32,934 --> 01:38:33,912
Don't worn]. Nothing will happen.

1483
01:38:33,967 --> 01:38:35,173
Hurry up. Go.

1484
01:38:43,434 --> 01:38:44,310
Yes, Vi rat?

1485
01:38:44,934 --> 01:38:48,347
You cannot get any information
by torturing an army man.

1486
01:38:48,467 --> 01:38:50,708
That's why they are kidnapping
the girls in their family.

1487
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:51,904
Bloody cowards.

1488
01:38:52,067 --> 01:38:52,738
Why?

1489
01:38:52,767 --> 01:38:55,270
To find out which team
killed those 12 terrorists.

1490
01:38:55,334 --> 01:38:58,907
...they'll kidnap the girls
and threaten the family on the phone.

1491
01:38:58,967 --> 01:39:00,105
They will blackmail them.

1492
01:39:00,267 --> 01:39:02,941
I'm sending you the
numbers of the 5 guys..

1493
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,243
...he had marked in
the album right away.

1494
01:39:06,701 --> 01:39:08,078
Listen to me very carefully, Mukund.

1495
01:39:08,167 --> 01:39:09,305
Call them.

1496
01:39:09,434 --> 01:39:13,405
Ask them to give the numbers of all
the girls that are not in the house.

1497
01:39:13,767 --> 01:39:15,075
Go to the control room..

1498
01:39:15,134 --> 01:39:18,877
...and check in which area
are their sim cards travelling.

1499
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:19,978
Okay.

1500
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:28,944
Yes, tell me.

1501
01:39:29,067 --> 01:39:30,068
Where are you?

1502
01:39:30,134 --> 01:39:31,670
I'm going to the designing class.

1503
01:39:31,701 --> 01:39:33,203
Where are you at this ven/ moment?

1504
01:39:33,267 --> 01:39:34,837
Santacruz. Why?

1505
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:36,644
These five mobile numbers..

1506
01:39:36,667 --> 01:39:38,408
Quickly track in which area they are.
- Yes, sir.

1507
01:39:49,301 --> 01:39:50,109
Hello?

1508
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,339
Virat, my sister went
for jogging in the morning.

1509
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,905
Someone forced her
into a car and left.

1510
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:55,910
Yeah?

1511
01:40:03,067 --> 01:40:04,171
This number is not showing.

1512
01:40:04,234 --> 01:40:06,976
This.. Yes, Virat?
I was just about to call you.

1513
01:40:07,034 --> 01:40:07,944
Why? What happened?

1514
01:40:08,001 --> 01:40:11,346
Out of those five girls one
girl's number is already deactivated.

1515
01:40:11,401 --> 01:40:13,312
And another number
just got deactivated.

1516
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,880
I too received a phone
call 45 minutes ago.

1517
01:40:16,067 --> 01:40:18,104
They kidnapped another girl.

1518
01:40:18,667 --> 01:40:20,078
Virat, we need a
big police force for it.

1519
01:40:20,134 --> 01:40:22,239
Their families have
filed police complaints.

1520
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:24,337
Please don't get confuse now.

1521
01:40:24,867 --> 01:40:25,777
What are you going to do?

1522
01:40:25,834 --> 01:40:26,778
I'll tell you.

1523
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:30,006
First you tell me where did that
second cell phone get deactivated?

1524
01:40:30,067 --> 01:40:33,913
Four kilometres from where she studied,
travelling towards south-Mumbai..

1525
01:40:33,967 --> 01:40:36,277
Her sim card was
deactivated in Byculla.

1526
01:40:36,734 --> 01:40:38,839
And the girl who went
missing before her..

1527
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,071
Her sim card too was
deactivated in Byculla.

1528
01:40:41,134 --> 01:40:44,138
Okay. Do one thing. Leave for Byculla.

1529
01:40:44,201 --> 01:40:45,202
I'll meet you on the way.

1530
01:40:45,267 --> 01:40:49,613
Listen Virat, let's call and immediately
warn the rest of the three girls..

1531
01:40:49,667 --> 01:40:51,078
...not to get out of the house alone.

1532
01:40:51,134 --> 01:40:53,705
Look, don't do anything.
Don't ruin anything.

1533
01:40:53,767 --> 01:40:57,806
That sleeper cells' head is
more important than those five girls.

1534
01:40:58,134 --> 01:40:58,839
Got it?

1535
01:40:58,934 --> 01:41:00,777
Now quickly leave that place.
- Hello, Virat?

1536
01:41:01,334 --> 01:41:02,312
Shit.

1537
01:41:09,267 --> 01:41:10,007
Hello?

1538
01:41:10,067 --> 01:41:13,241
My sister went to college
in the morning to attend a seminar.

1539
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,677
The fourth girl was also taken.

1540
01:41:20,567 --> 01:41:21,568
Hello?

1541
01:41:23,101 --> 01:41:25,775
Yes! The fifth girl
was also kidnapped!

1542
01:41:26,267 --> 01:41:27,678
Are you a human or a sadist?

1543
01:41:27,734 --> 01:41:28,940
Why are you so happy?

1544
01:41:29,234 --> 01:41:30,770
Five girls have been kidnapped.

1545
01:41:30,834 --> 01:41:32,677
You are not at all worried about them?

1546
01:41:33,967 --> 01:41:36,038
I know what is important for you.

1547
01:41:36,567 --> 01:41:39,013
Sleeper cells' head should
come outside so that you can kill him.

1548
01:41:39,067 --> 01:41:40,102
Right?

1549
01:41:40,567 --> 01:41:43,980
Do you know what will
happen if he is caught?

1550
01:41:44,167 --> 01:41:47,080
All the bomb blasts and terrorist
acts happening in Mumbai..

1551
01:41:47,134 --> 01:41:49,205
...will stop for many
years to come. Got it?

1552
01:41:49,267 --> 01:41:53,738
But the lives of the five girls
who have been kidnapped are at stake.

1553
01:41:53,801 --> 01:41:56,213
Think about them.
Think about their family.

1554
01:41:56,534 --> 01:41:58,104
I am not concerned about anything.

1555
01:41:58,167 --> 01:42:01,637
Will you say the same thing if
someone from your family is kidnapped?

1556
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:04,146
I told you,
it makes no difference to me.

1557
01:42:04,634 --> 01:42:08,104
Anyway, out of those five
girls one girl is my sister. Got it?

1558
01:42:09,834 --> 01:42:11,677
All I know is..

1559
01:42:11,934 --> 01:42:15,507
...that that terrorist will keep
all the kidnapped girls at one place.

1560
01:42:15,834 --> 01:42:18,644
We need to save them
and also catch that scoundrel.

1561
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:20,509
No, wait a minute.

1562
01:42:20,767 --> 01:42:21,745
<i>P tee“?</i>

1563
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:25,270
In those five photos
one boy's name was Sarfaraz.

1564
01:42:26,034 --> 01:42:28,913
I sent my sister in place of his.

1565
01:42:28,967 --> 01:42:30,571
Where are you at this ven/ moment?

1566
01:42:30,634 --> 01:42:32,443
Santacruz. Why?

1567
01:42:32,667 --> 01:42:33,668
Do one thing.

1568
01:42:33,734 --> 01:42:35,145
Go to Rizwi college.

1569
01:42:35,201 --> 01:42:37,203
You know my team-mate Sarfaraz?

1570
01:42:37,467 --> 01:42:39,538
Take his sister's
Scooty and come here.

1571
01:42:39,867 --> 01:42:42,040
Why should I get her Scooty?

1572
01:42:42,501 --> 01:42:43,502
Because I am asking you to.

1573
01:42:43,567 --> 01:42:45,137
Go and get it right away!

1574
01:42:45,801 --> 01:42:47,974
There's a 40% discount at Lewis.

1575
01:42:48,034 --> 01:42:49,980
Will you buy me three-fourth pants?

1576
01:42:50,567 --> 01:42:53,104
I'll buy you two instead.
Hurry up now.

1577
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:54,544
Okay.

1578
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:10,111
Have you lost your mind, Virat!

1579
01:43:10,934 --> 01:43:11,969
I just can't think straight.

1580
01:43:12,067 --> 01:43:15,014
I mean being her brother
how can you do this?

1581
01:43:15,134 --> 01:43:16,807
Nothing will happen to her.

1582
01:43:17,767 --> 01:43:19,838
Not just her,
nothing will happen to anyone.

1583
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:21,808
Stop. Stop here.

1584
01:43:21,867 --> 01:43:23,141
What's Pinkie doing over here?

1585
01:43:25,634 --> 01:43:26,612
Brother, this..

1586
01:43:37,667 --> 01:43:40,045
Brother, listen..
This is Preeti's stole.

1587
01:43:40,101 --> 01:43:42,012
And get a maroon top for me.

1588
01:43:42,067 --> 01:43:43,410
There should be
embroidery done over here.

1589
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:44,741
And I want mirror work over here.

1590
01:43:44,801 --> 01:43:45,939
Okay? Medium size.

1591
01:43:46,001 --> 01:43:47,912
Okay? Bye. See you.

1592
01:43:52,067 --> 01:43:53,137
Okay, Virat.

1593
01:43:53,467 --> 01:43:55,538
I'll go and ask my informers.

1594
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:56,670
Let's see.

1595
01:44:11,634 --> 01:44:12,806
Go!

1596
01:44:36,367 --> 01:44:38,404
Untie their hands.

1597
01:44:44,801 --> 01:44:46,974
Project the photos one by one.

1598
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:51,473
Who knows him?

1599
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:55,712
Who knows him!

1600
01:44:56,967 --> 01:44:58,503
He's my brother.

1601
01:44:58,734 --> 01:44:59,940
Go over there.

1602
01:45:09,067 --> 01:45:10,978
My uncle..

1603
01:45:15,067 --> 01:45:16,740
He's my brother.

1604
01:45:25,334 --> 01:45:26,312
Your brother?

1605
01:45:26,767 --> 01:45:27,802
No.

1606
01:45:28,867 --> 01:45:29,971
Your brother?

1607
01:45:34,933 --> 01:45:36,606
Project the next photo.

1608
01:45:39,633 --> 01:45:40,873
He's my brother.

1609
01:45:42,567 --> 01:45:43,739
Go over there.

1610
01:45:54,767 --> 01:45:56,974
Your brother is not
in these five photographs?

1611
01:45:57,267 --> 01:45:58,007
No.

1612
01:46:01,734 --> 01:46:03,680
Show the group photos one by one.

1613
01:46:06,501 --> 01:46:08,242
Is your brother there
in this photograph?

1614
01:46:26,567 --> 01:46:27,910
That's him.

1615
01:46:29,467 --> 01:46:30,343
He?

1616
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,378
No.

1617
01:46:32,567 --> 01:46:33,477
He?

1618
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:35,904
Yes.

1619
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:46,275
Who asked you to drive the Scooty
of the girl we were going to kidnap?

1620
01:46:48,967 --> 01:46:50,310
My brother.

1621
01:47:02,267 --> 01:47:02,904
Yes?

1622
01:47:03,267 --> 01:47:04,871
The operation is successful.

1623
01:47:05,367 --> 01:47:07,745
We know the team of those 12 people.

1624
01:47:07,867 --> 01:47:11,280
One member of that team sent
his sister in place of another.

1625
01:47:11,367 --> 01:47:13,745
I've discarded the sim cards
from the phones of all the girls.

1626
01:47:13,834 --> 01:47:17,611
He has no chance of
finding out where we are.

1627
01:47:17,667 --> 01:47:19,237
No, no, no!

1628
01:47:19,434 --> 01:47:20,674
He is not a fool.

1629
01:47:20,734 --> 01:47:25,547
If he can send his sister then
he must've found a way to reach you.

1630
01:47:25,734 --> 01:47:27,577
He will find you.

1631
01:47:27,801 --> 01:47:28,836
What are you saying?!

1632
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:32,473
Kill the girls and vacate
the place before he finds you.

1633
01:47:32,534 --> 01:47:33,740
Right away!
Tie these four girls!

1634
01:47:33,801 --> 01:47:34,643
Okay.

1635
01:47:34,701 --> 01:47:36,180
And bring this girl over here.

1636
01:47:36,234 --> 01:47:36,905
Hurry up!

1637
01:47:37,167 --> 01:47:38,339
Come on!

1638
01:47:41,467 --> 01:47:42,639
Come with me!

1639
01:47:44,201 --> 01:47:45,373
Set up the camera.

1640
01:47:46,601 --> 01:47:47,545
Bring them here.

1641
01:47:48,301 --> 01:47:49,439
Hurry up. Make her sit!

1642
01:48:03,801 --> 01:48:05,405
Silence.

1643
01:49:25,333 --> 01:49:26,141
He is here.

1644
01:49:26,567 --> 01:49:28,240
He is trying to kill everyone.

1645
01:50:16,267 --> 01:50:17,268
Turn around.

1646
01:51:26,267 --> 01:51:28,304
Come on! Come on!

1647
01:52:15,401 --> 01:52:17,506
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

1648
01:52:18,101 --> 01:52:20,274
I'll drop guys in a taxi.

1649
01:52:20,434 --> 01:52:24,940
If cops ask whether you saw
anything say that it was too dark.

1650
01:52:24,967 --> 01:52:26,844
You couldn't see my face. Understood?

1651
01:52:26,867 --> 01:52:27,470
Okay?
- Yes.

1652
01:52:27,567 --> 01:52:28,875
Come on, get into the car.

1653
01:52:28,967 --> 01:52:29,604
Come on, fast.

1654
01:53:11,467 --> 01:53:14,141
Purposely! You got me
trapped purposely, didn't you!

1655
01:53:14,267 --> 01:53:16,304
He was holding such
a big knife over here!

1656
01:53:16,401 --> 01:53:19,348
A little movement and
he would've severed my head!

1657
01:53:20,334 --> 01:53:23,338
We could catch him because
we placed your life at risk!

1658
01:53:23,467 --> 01:53:26,004
You should have risked your own life!

1659
01:53:26,034 --> 01:53:28,014
Why me? What had I done?

1660
01:53:28,101 --> 01:53:30,547
Why? Can't you civilians
sacrifice your lives?

1661
01:53:30,834 --> 01:53:34,281
Should only military
and cops sacrifice theirs?

1662
01:53:34,334 --> 01:53:37,508
You just want to sit on
your sofa and watch news channels.

1663
01:53:37,834 --> 01:53:39,211
And pass comments like..

1664
01:53:39,401 --> 01:53:41,403
“These cops should do this.”

1665
01:53:41,467 --> 01:53:44,448
“No, the militan/ is wrong.
They should do this"

1666
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:46,241
You never want to
do anything on your own.

1667
01:53:46,934 --> 01:53:50,882
What would've happened if
I would've got shot in the crossfire?

1668
01:53:50,934 --> 01:53:52,379
What would've happened?
You would've lost your life.

1669
01:53:52,434 --> 01:53:53,879
What else could've happened?

1670
01:53:54,134 --> 01:53:57,809
Yeah, right, I would've lost my life.

1671
01:53:57,968 --> 01:53:59,174
<i>Free“,</i>

1672
01:54:00,267 --> 01:54:03,510
when those terrorists
who intend to kill thousands.

1673
01:54:03,867 --> 01:54:07,940
...are ready to sacrifice
their lives then why can't we?

1674
01:54:08,001 --> 01:54:09,036
Think about it.

1675
01:54:09,867 --> 01:54:14,282
Now look, because of you
that main guy was caught, alive.

1676
01:54:15,001 --> 01:54:16,378
He isn't the main terrorist.

1677
01:54:16,434 --> 01:54:18,505
Someone called him up and ordered.

1678
01:54:18,767 --> 01:54:21,077
After that he took out the knife.

1679
01:55:31,734 --> 01:55:33,042
What's this?

1680
01:55:35,334 --> 01:55:36,642
Nail cutter.

1681
01:55:38,367 --> 01:55:39,368
What are you doing over here?

1682
01:55:39,634 --> 01:55:42,137
That day you left in
the middle hence I came here.

1683
01:55:42,234 --> 01:55:44,908
Don't ever come up from
behind me and startle me again.

1684
01:55:44,967 --> 01:55:46,071
Why?

1685
01:55:46,301 --> 01:55:49,248
There could've been someone
else with me in this room.

1686
01:55:52,167 --> 01:55:55,171
Sandbag, dumbbells..

1687
01:55:55,934 --> 01:55:57,743
You workout as well.

1688
01:55:57,900 --> 01:55:59,140
Not bad.

1689
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:02,880
You know I read this
in a forwarded message..

1690
01:56:03,067 --> 01:56:06,139
That 40 calories are
burned during a deep kiss.

1691
01:56:06,201 --> 01:56:07,942
That's equal to 30
minutes of brisk walking.

1692
01:56:07,967 --> 01:56:10,948
20 minutes of swimming, 10
minutes of skipping and 5 minutes of..

1693
01:56:11,967 --> 01:56:13,105
You want a kiss?

1694
01:56:13,267 --> 01:56:16,009
Then ask for it directly.
Don't beat around the bush.

1695
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:18,246
Forward message,
science of construction, email..

1696
01:56:18,301 --> 01:56:19,974
These are vacuous things.

1697
01:56:20,134 --> 01:56:22,842
Anyway, I very well
know how girls like you are.

1698
01:56:23,134 --> 01:56:26,138
You want it but you blame us for it.

1699
01:56:26,367 --> 01:56:29,007
“You know, you know,
you know, that boy is so mean!"

1700
01:56:29,067 --> 01:56:30,410
“You know I just hate him."

1701
01:56:30,667 --> 01:56:31,873
Useless.. - “My mom.."

1702
01:56:35,667 --> 01:56:39,706
Now that you are here why just 40..

1703
01:56:40,801 --> 01:56:42,747
...let's burn 80 calories.

1704
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:45,646
Or 160?

1705
01:56:46,134 --> 01:56:48,740
Or 240?

1706
01:56:49,034 --> 01:56:52,106
By morning we both
will be sporting six-packs.

1707
01:56:57,867 --> 01:56:58,743
Not here.

1708
01:56:58,967 --> 01:56:59,945
Let's go over there.

1709
01:57:03,901 --> 01:57:05,676
Now who is concerned
about the location?

1710
01:57:05,734 --> 01:57:06,769
I am.

1711
01:57:06,934 --> 01:57:08,106
Close your eyes.

1712
01:57:11,267 --> 01:57:13,338
If I close my eyes, you will run away.

1713
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:15,107
I won't.

1714
01:57:20,001 --> 01:57:20,775
Who is it?

1715
01:57:20,834 --> 01:57:22,711
I told you! I think mom's here!

1716
01:57:23,734 --> 01:57:25,111
Go and open the door,
I'll go hide in this cupboard.

1717
01:57:25,134 --> 01:57:26,340
Not there! Not there!

1718
01:57:26,601 --> 01:57:27,341
Not there! Not there!

1719
01:57:27,567 --> 01:57:29,342
It contains my knickers.
Do one thing. You hide here!

1720
01:57:29,568 --> 01:57:31,343
Hide in here.

1721
01:57:32,267 --> 01:57:33,678
Hey.. - HUT"! UP!

1722
01:57:33,701 --> 01:57:34,975
Hurry.. Climb up!

1723
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:36,907
Just take a deep breath.

1724
01:57:45,334 --> 01:57:46,278
Did you watch the television?

1725
01:57:46,634 --> 01:57:47,704
What's the score?

1726
01:57:47,901 --> 01:57:51,280
Stop the drama.
I just saw what you did.

1727
01:57:52,700 --> 01:57:54,179
16 people are dead.

1728
01:57:54,734 --> 01:57:56,338
All of them were sleeper cells.

1729
01:57:56,734 --> 01:57:59,214
Everyone had perfectly normal jobs.

1730
01:58:00,167 --> 01:58:02,909
Now the difficult job
is to convince their family.

1731
01:58:02,967 --> 01:58:04,241
Because none of them
are ready to believe that.

1732
01:58:04,267 --> 01:58:06,144
This is what I expected from them.

1733
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:09,804
Did you find out anything
about the head of the sleeper cell?

1734
01:58:21,867 --> 01:58:24,871
I knew it! I was sure
that you'll bring him along!

1735
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:27,046
But he isn't the head.

1736
01:58:27,134 --> 01:58:28,875
We still haven't found him.

1737
01:58:29,734 --> 01:58:31,077
Oh..

1738
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:34,275
Why is he coughing like a girl?

1739
01:58:35,934 --> 01:58:36,878
What happened?

1740
01:58:37,567 --> 01:58:38,272
Are you alright?

1741
01:58:39,501 --> 01:58:40,809
Another sleeper cell?

1742
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:52,012
You aren't used to keeping
books and clothes in the cupboard?

1743
01:58:52,567 --> 01:58:53,875
Say hi to him.

1744
01:58:54,001 --> 01:58:55,605
Hi.
- Hi.

1745
01:58:56,134 --> 01:58:57,875
You are going to marry him?

1746
01:58:58,134 --> 01:58:59,010
Yes.

1747
01:58:59,101 --> 01:59:01,206
Wonderful.

1748
01:59:01,701 --> 01:59:04,272
He's half mad. You are half mad.

1749
01:59:04,767 --> 01:59:05,939
Kids will be fully mad.

1750
01:59:07,101 --> 01:59:08,842
He's feeling shy!

1751
01:59:25,767 --> 01:59:30,841
“My head seems a little poetic!”

1752
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:35,906
“My head seems a little poetic!”

1753
01:59:36,734 --> 01:59:41,046
“It keeps soaring high,
doesn't desire to perch.”

1754
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:46,174
“My head seems a little poetic!”

1755
01:59:46,801 --> 01:59:51,147
“lt's spoilt,
doesn't desire to ameliorate.”

1756
01:59:51,201 --> 01:59:56,173
“My head seems a little poetic!”

1757
01:59:57,567 --> 01:59:59,740
“It keeps searching for you.”

1758
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:02,041
“It keeps looking
for you in my thoughts.”

1759
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:06,606
“It takes me whenever
there's even a shadow of you.”

1760
02:00:07,767 --> 02:00:09,906
“It keeps searching for you.”

1761
02:00:09,967 --> 02:00:12,573
“It keeps looking
for you in my desires."

1762
02:00:12,901 --> 02:00:16,781
“Wherever it finds you,
it worships you.”

1763
02:00:16,801 --> 02:00:21,716
“My head seems a little poetic!”

1764
02:00:21,801 --> 02:00:27,114
“My head seems a little poetic!”

1765
02:00:48,834 --> 02:00:51,713
“Sought you in the morning..”

1766
02:00:51,767 --> 02:00:55,772
“Called out to you in the evening."

1767
02:00:55,867 --> 02:00:58,711
In the evening."

1768
02:00:58,934 --> 02:01:06,011
“More than my own, chanted your name."

1769
02:01:06,067 --> 02:01:09,071
“Your name."

1770
02:01:09,134 --> 02:01:18,054
“You have now become,
a pan of my conversations.”

1771
02:01:18,101 --> 02:01:23,016
“It seems to be in love."

1772
02:01:23,067 --> 02:01:27,948
“My head seems a little poetic!”

1773
02:01:50,067 --> 02:01:53,014
“You are my silence."

1774
02:01:53,067 --> 02:01:56,947
“You are my voice too.”

1775
02:01:57,067 --> 02:02:00,412
“My voice too.”

1776
02:02:00,467 --> 02:02:03,346
“You are solitude.”

1777
02:02:03,401 --> 02:02:07,406
“You are my company too.”

1778
02:02:07,467 --> 02:02:10,607
“My company too.”

1779
02:02:10,667 --> 02:02:15,548
“How did this happen?”

1780
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:19,070
“I didn't realise it.”

1781
02:02:19,367 --> 02:02:24,476
“It seems a little crazy.”

1782
02:02:24,534 --> 02:02:29,540
“My head seems a little poetic!”

1783
02:02:54,268 --> 02:02:57,477
'Today, in Andheri West, a man's
dead body was found near a gutter.'

1784
02:02:57,534 --> 02:02:58,945
'His fingers were abscised.'

1785
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,241
'His body was bruised.'

1786
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:05,476
'According to the police,
he was tortured before he was killed.'

1787
02:03:05,534 --> 02:03:07,639
'His name is said to be Aasif Ali.'

1788
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:10,943
This is related to the
death of 12 sleeper cells.

1789
02:03:11,267 --> 02:03:12,575
The bomb blasts on 27th September..

1790
02:03:12,634 --> 02:03:17,606
He killed him because
he didn't get any information.

1791
02:03:19,868 --> 02:03:24,476
The one you are looking
for is one of these 12 people.

1792
02:03:24,934 --> 02:03:28,211
He is a cold-blooded murderer.

1793
02:03:28,867 --> 02:03:30,676
Instigate him.

1794
02:03:31,667 --> 02:03:33,578
Plan something big.

1795
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:36,571
A powerful attack.

1796
02:03:37,667 --> 02:03:39,704
He will show himself.

1797
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:45,477
Show him the power of sleeper cells.

1798
02:03:54,467 --> 02:03:56,674
Do one thing, mom.
Go ahead, I'll be there soon.

1799
02:03:56,734 --> 02:03:58,611
Hurry up.
- Yes, I'm coming.

1800
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:10,202
Let's finish this game.

1801
02:04:10,901 --> 02:04:12,608
I want you.

1802
02:04:13,367 --> 02:04:14,402
Alive.

1803
02:04:16,234 --> 02:04:18,271
Call your team-mate Kapil.

1804
02:04:18,634 --> 02:04:20,307
He is at the R-city mall.

1805
02:04:20,468 --> 02:04:27,682
Tell him the building he is
in is going to blast in 10 seconds.

1806
02:04:28,167 --> 02:04:29,669
Hey! Listen!

1807
02:04:36,134 --> 02:04:37,613
Hey, Virat! How are you?

1808
02:04:37,667 --> 02:04:39,305
Kapil! Where are you?

1809
02:04:39,367 --> 02:04:41,574
I'm out with my family.

1810
02:04:41,634 --> 02:04:42,840
But where are you?

1811
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:44,408
R-city mall.

1812
02:04:46,334 --> 02:04:49,338
Kapil, take your family
and leave that place right away.

1813
02:04:49,401 --> 02:04:50,209
There's a bomb over there.

1814
02:04:50,301 --> 02:04:51,609
Chocolate.
- Get out of there.

1815
02:04:51,667 --> 02:04:53,112
Chocolate?
- What are you saying?

1816
02:04:53,167 --> 02:04:56,478
Kapil, I said, the bomb is going to blast
in five seconds. Get out of there!

1817
02:04:56,767 --> 02:04:58,474
There are a lot of people here.

1818
02:04:58,534 --> 02:05:01,208
Inform everybody and leave!

1819
02:05:04,134 --> 02:05:05,135
Kapil!

1820
02:05:06,367 --> 02:05:09,143
Kapil, don't think!
Just get out of there!

1821
02:05:26,334 --> 02:05:27,404
Heard that?

1822
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:29,309
How was the sound?

1823
02:05:30,301 --> 02:05:36,252
That's not all. I know exactly
where the rest of the 11 people are.

1824
02:05:36,267 --> 02:05:39,271
Because each one of them
is being followed by a sleeper cell.

1825
02:05:39,334 --> 02:05:40,608
You want to check?

1826
02:05:42,567 --> 02:05:44,513
Monty Baggha, Juhu Beach.

1827
02:05:44,567 --> 02:05:46,604
Yogesh, Hanuman Temple.

1828
02:05:46,667 --> 02:05:48,772
Jigar Gill, COD Mulund.

1829
02:05:49,034 --> 02:05:51,071
Chirag Sethi, Mithibai College.

1830
02:05:51,201 --> 02:05:53,579
Sarfaraz, Sea-face, Caner Road.

1831
02:05:53,634 --> 02:05:55,705
Vishal, PVR Kurla.

1832
02:05:55,767 --> 02:05:57,769
Lalit, Phoenix Mall.

1833
02:05:58,034 --> 02:06:00,378
Sandeep Sachdeva, Andheri Market.

1834
02:06:00,434 --> 02:06:02,778
Abhay Shukla, Mount Man] Church.

1835
02:06:03,034 --> 02:06:05,446
Virat Bakshi, Bandra Market.

1836
02:06:05,534 --> 02:06:09,072
And Siddhanh, Goregaon Station.

1837
02:06:10,467 --> 02:06:12,572
Now let me blow up the next one.

1838
02:06:14,067 --> 02:06:17,708
Virat Bakshi,
who is at the Bandra Market.

1839
02:06:21,667 --> 02:06:25,581
There will be a blast over
there in the next three seconds.

1840
02:06:28,468 --> 02:06:29,378
Three..

1841
02:06:32,467 --> 02:06:33,411
Two..

1842
02:06:36,700 --> 02:06:37,610
One!

1843
02:06:41,767 --> 02:06:43,371
Boom!

1844
02:06:46,034 --> 02:06:47,172
Got scared?

1845
02:06:48,301 --> 02:06:49,609
You got scared huh?

1846
02:06:50,034 --> 02:06:52,173
I didn't place a bomb over there.

1847
02:06:52,201 --> 02:06:54,374
I don't want them dead.

1848
02:06:54,667 --> 02:06:56,146
I want you.

1849
02:06:56,601 --> 02:06:57,739
I need you.

1850
02:06:58,067 --> 02:06:59,205
Okay.

1851
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:01,509
You want me, right?

1852
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:04,145
I'll come to you.

1853
02:07:04,667 --> 02:07:06,146
Don't harm anyone else.

1854
02:07:06,267 --> 02:07:07,678
Good decision.

1855
02:07:08,534 --> 02:07:10,207
Get ready.

1856
02:07:18,301 --> 02:07:19,473
How are you?
- Hello, Virat!

1857
02:07:19,567 --> 02:07:21,103
Great!
- See you later.

1858
02:07:21,701 --> 02:07:24,045
What is this place? Who are they?

1859
02:07:25,034 --> 02:07:30,040
We all know those who die
in border war and counter terrorism.

1860
02:07:30,301 --> 02:07:34,545
They are the army officers
who are handicapped during war.

1861
02:07:35,334 --> 02:07:37,280
No one knows them.

1862
02:07:37,534 --> 02:07:40,413
In every field, if you work sincerely,
you get promoted.

1863
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:43,979
But only in army and police..

1864
02:07:44,034 --> 02:07:45,536
You get retirement.

1865
02:07:46,034 --> 02:07:47,411
And that's a shame.

1866
02:07:47,534 --> 02:07:49,070
Hi, Virat.
- Hi.

1867
02:07:49,334 --> 02:07:50,438
Even/things ready.

1868
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:53,474
Hello, everyone.

1869
02:07:53,534 --> 02:07:55,343
Hi.
- Hi.

1870
02:07:56,601 --> 02:07:57,705
How are you guys?

1871
02:07:57,967 --> 02:07:59,969
Fine. - Good. - Great.

1872
02:08:00,267 --> 02:08:02,975
I've already spoken to
all of you over the phone.

1873
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:06,213
The time we have been
waiting for has come.

1874
02:08:06,401 --> 02:08:09,644
We are going to execute
an assignment together.

1875
02:08:13,367 --> 02:08:16,610
Tomorrow morning,
I am going to meet the head.

1876
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,980
The one who controls
the sleeper cells.

1877
02:08:19,034 --> 02:08:23,039
At that moment no one can follow
me because they'll keep an eye on me.

1878
02:08:23,167 --> 02:08:27,547
Before meeting him, I'm going
to insert a tracking chip in my body.

1879
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:31,104
That chip will indicate my movements.

1880
02:08:31,167 --> 02:08:33,306
And you will be communicating
everything to him.

1881
02:08:33,367 --> 02:08:34,345
Okay?

1882
02:08:35,434 --> 02:08:41,942
I've very secretly called for cyclonite
explosive that we use in the army.

1883
02:08:42,001 --> 02:08:43,674
We will get it by this evening.

1884
02:08:43,934 --> 02:08:47,040
With that we will make
C-4 plastic explosive.

1885
02:08:47,101 --> 02:08:49,081
After making it you'll
give it to Joel.

1886
02:08:49,134 --> 02:08:51,239
Joel, you'll be in touch with Mukund.

1887
02:08:51,301 --> 02:08:53,577
Mukund, you keep telling
him where they are taking me.

1888
02:08:53,634 --> 02:08:56,080
I am sure they'll take
me to an isolated place.

1889
02:09:07,467 --> 02:09:10,414
No one knows why he wants me alive.

1890
02:09:10,501 --> 02:09:13,107
I am sure there must
be a reason behind it.

1891
02:09:13,168 --> 02:09:18,140
Exactly 15 minutes after
I meet the sleeper cells' head..

1892
02:09:18,534 --> 02:09:21,276
...that bomb should explode, Joel.

1893
02:09:21,334 --> 02:09:23,405
It is your responsibility.

1894
02:09:24,234 --> 02:09:27,511
Along with me, those who
order sleeper cells will also die.

1895
02:09:27,567 --> 02:09:31,947
After that all sleeper
cells will become coma cells.

1896
02:09:32,267 --> 02:09:35,009
They will never receive any order.

1897
02:09:35,267 --> 02:09:37,076
It's like a suicide attack.

1898
02:09:37,134 --> 02:09:38,272
Boom!

1899
02:09:41,534 --> 02:09:43,844
What kind of a joke is this, Virat!

1900
02:09:44,167 --> 02:09:47,114
You are talking about suicide
and they are applauding.

1901
02:09:48,001 --> 02:09:49,241
What's happening, man!

1902
02:09:49,301 --> 02:09:50,939
He is a very dangerous man.

1903
02:09:51,001 --> 02:09:53,914
Fine. But why do you
need to sacrifice your life?

1904
02:09:54,834 --> 02:09:56,438
You too have a family.
Think about them!

1905
02:09:56,501 --> 02:09:58,845
They too had a family...!

1906
02:09:59,167 --> 02:10:01,306
Those who were killed
during the Taj attack.

1907
02:10:02,567 --> 02:10:06,572
They too left at night telling their
kids that they'll be back by morning.

1908
02:10:06,901 --> 02:10:08,972
Hemant Karkare,
Vijay Salaskar, Ashok Kamte..

1909
02:10:09,034 --> 02:10:11,844
Sandeep Unnikrishnan,
Sashank Shinde, Tukaram Omble.

1910
02:10:11,967 --> 02:10:13,344
They too had a family.

1911
02:10:13,434 --> 02:10:14,538
Their dead bodies reached home.

1912
02:10:14,601 --> 02:10:16,979
Have you thought about their families?

1913
02:10:17,534 --> 02:10:19,878
He talks about family!

1914
02:10:20,534 --> 02:10:22,411
Here.. look at them!

1915
02:10:22,567 --> 02:10:24,410
Some don't have a spinal cord.

1916
02:10:24,467 --> 02:10:25,537
Some don't have legs.

1917
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:28,440
Some don't have hands.
Some are blind.

1918
02:10:28,967 --> 02:10:31,038
But still, they are happy.

1919
02:10:31,134 --> 02:10:33,080
They too have a family.

1920
02:10:44,334 --> 02:10:47,372
An army man couldn't
get a better opportunity.

1921
02:10:49,001 --> 02:10:51,504
When those terrorists who
intend to kill thousands are ready..

1922
02:10:51,767 --> 02:10:55,772
...to sacrifice their lives then
why can't we, the protectors do that?

1923
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:03,277
Mukund, I came to this decision
after giving it a lot of thought.

1924
02:11:04,334 --> 02:11:06,814
If you want to do something for me..

1925
02:11:07,767 --> 02:11:10,373
My family is a little naive when
it comes to the ways of the world.

1926
02:11:10,767 --> 02:11:12,144
I have two sisters.

1927
02:11:12,367 --> 02:11:16,873
Whenever you can spare some time,
do visit them.

1928
02:11:31,201 --> 02:11:33,738
There's just four
days left the engagement.

1929
02:11:34,234 --> 02:11:36,305
And all of a sudden you
don't want to go ahead with.

1930
02:11:36,834 --> 02:11:38,472
It doesn't need to happen now.

1931
02:11:39,234 --> 02:11:41,009
We'll see when I come next.

1932
02:11:43,267 --> 02:11:45,247
But we are getting married next year.

1933
02:11:45,468 --> 02:11:47,846
We were just getting engaged.

1934
02:11:49,867 --> 02:11:51,710
But that's not needed either.

1935
02:11:53,034 --> 02:11:54,843
First you said that you don't like me.

1936
02:11:55,234 --> 02:11:56,838
Then you said you like me.

1937
02:11:57,434 --> 02:11:59,209
And now, once again..

1938
02:12:00,134 --> 02:12:01,807
Do you even really like me?

1939
02:12:01,867 --> 02:12:04,313
Don't you understand?
I said no, didn't I?

1940
02:12:04,767 --> 02:12:05,871
Not now.

1941
02:12:10,101 --> 02:12:12,012
Will you be able to forget me?

1942
02:12:18,467 --> 02:12:20,071
I won't be able to do it.

1943
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,913
My man is standing next to you.

1944
02:13:40,634 --> 02:13:41,704
Where is he?

1945
02:14:11,667 --> 02:14:12,839
He's clean.

1946
02:14:18,167 --> 02:14:18,872
Hello..

1947
02:14:18,934 --> 02:14:24,612
Can you see an Indigo car,
3525, across the road?

1948
02:14:27,801 --> 02:14:29,041
Get in it.

1949
02:14:46,267 --> 02:14:51,239
Straight ahead,
black Honda City, 7087.

1950
02:14:51,501 --> 02:14:54,675
Take it to Bombay Stock Exchange.

1951
02:18:27,334 --> 02:18:28,972
You must be wondering..

1952
02:18:29,501 --> 02:18:31,572
Why haven't I still killed you?

1953
02:18:31,668 --> 02:18:33,375
What's my plan?

1954
02:18:35,401 --> 02:18:36,744
You don't know, do you?

1955
02:18:37,034 --> 02:18:38,377
I'll tell you.

1956
02:18:45,501 --> 02:18:48,004
The cars you parked..

1957
02:18:53,401 --> 02:18:55,506
Do you know what was in them?

1958
02:19:03,067 --> 02:19:04,910
I won't blow them up.

1959
02:19:06,334 --> 02:19:08,439
I'll inform the police.

1960
02:19:09,467 --> 02:19:13,574
Then the question that shall
arise will be who planted them.

1961
02:19:15,834 --> 02:19:16,505
Then..

1962
02:19:32,400 --> 02:19:34,380
While the police will
be looking for you..

1963
02:19:34,634 --> 02:19:38,844
I would've already killed
you and your 10 team-mates.

1964
02:19:38,901 --> 02:19:41,814
Rather according to the police,
to kill you..

1965
02:19:41,867 --> 02:19:44,575
And to defuse the time
bomb at the right time.

1966
02:19:44,734 --> 02:19:46,805
Do you know who will
take the credit of it?

1967
02:19:48,468 --> 02:19:49,276
Look at this.

1968
02:19:49,934 --> 02:19:51,971
Mr. Alwyn Dsouza.

1969
02:19:53,434 --> 02:19:55,744
Joint Secretary of Defence.

1970
02:19:57,867 --> 02:20:01,974
Not just that, the 12 sleeper
cells whom you have killed..

1971
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:05,813
The credit of that as well will
go to the Joint Secretary of Defence.

1972
02:20:06,467 --> 02:20:09,004
And with that he will get promoted.

1973
02:20:09,267 --> 02:20:12,476
And he will become
the Secretary of Defence.

1974
02:20:12,867 --> 02:20:17,748
Virat, there are sleeper
cells all across lndia..

1975
02:20:17,800 --> 02:20:20,406
...except in the Indian army.

1976
02:20:21,267 --> 02:20:22,905
But with this,

1977
02:20:23,401 --> 02:20:26,712
we will recruit sleeper
cells in the Indian army as well.

1978
02:20:26,767 --> 02:20:31,216
Then we shall do
everything we want to.

1979
02:20:35,667 --> 02:20:38,307
'I'll anyhow have to get out of here!'

1980
02:20:38,833 --> 02:20:40,369
'I cannot die.'

1981
02:20:40,934 --> 02:20:43,346
'Sleeper cells in the Indian army..'

1982
02:20:43,634 --> 02:20:45,511
'It's like cancer for our country.'

1983
02:21:13,833 --> 02:21:15,278
Any death wish?

1984
02:21:15,434 --> 02:21:17,209
Any last wishes?

1985
02:21:21,567 --> 02:21:24,173
I don't want you to
use your gun to kill me.

1986
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:31,335
Did you hear that?

1987
02:21:35,101 --> 02:21:38,480
I, too, don't want
to use my gun to kill you.

1988
02:23:16,467 --> 02:23:17,411
Hit me.

1989
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:36,243
Indian army!

1990
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:07,137
Uncuff my hands and then hit me.

1991
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,172
What did you say?

1992
02:24:13,267 --> 02:24:16,680
Uncuff my hands and then hit me.

1993
02:24:32,334 --> 02:24:33,278
Listen!

1994
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:40,313
You boss is hitting me
while my hands are cuffed.

1995
02:24:40,333 --> 02:24:43,177
And when I asked him to uncuffthem,
he's thinking.

1996
02:24:44,967 --> 02:24:47,243
You've already broken
my arms and legs.

1997
02:24:48,134 --> 02:24:52,105
You have so many men
who have weapons with them.

1998
02:24:52,567 --> 02:24:54,513
And yet, you are scared.

1999
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:00,346
You should be scared.

2000
02:25:01,934 --> 02:25:03,538
You should be scared.

2001
02:25:05,533 --> 02:25:07,069
Now laugh!

2002
02:25:07,467 --> 02:25:08,639
Laugh!

2003
02:25:08,933 --> 02:25:10,276
Laugh now!

2004
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:22,180
You are scared to uncuff my hands
and then hit me, aren't you?

2005
02:25:24,367 --> 02:25:26,608
I like this fear.

2006
02:25:27,300 --> 02:25:29,143
What are you doing, brother?

2007
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:30,543
Just shoot him.
Shoot him.

2008
02:25:30,601 --> 02:25:33,343
He's very clever.
Heed my advice, just shoot him.

2009
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:35,277
You cannot defeat him.

2010
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:39,070
I mean..

2011
02:25:43,133 --> 02:25:44,339
Uncuff him.

2012
02:28:16,201 --> 02:28:18,181
What is he doing, brother?
- I don't know.

2013
02:28:53,734 --> 02:28:55,338
They will fight each
other to death, brother.

2014
02:28:55,401 --> 02:28:57,881
Order me to shoot.
- No! Absolutely not!

2015
02:29:17,067 --> 02:29:18,375
No!

2016
02:29:39,334 --> 02:29:41,143
I say you shoot both of them!

2017
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:42,201
Shoot them!

2018
02:29:42,267 --> 02:29:44,213
We don't have any other option left!

2019
02:29:44,267 --> 02:29:46,247
Shoot both of them.

2020
02:29:49,367 --> 02:29:52,211
Drop your weapons into the sea.

2021
02:29:54,134 --> 02:29:55,238
Hurry Up-

2022
02:29:57,333 --> 02:29:59,836
You.. Give me my handcuffs.

2023
02:30:03,034 --> 02:30:03,808
My watch..

2024
02:30:06,167 --> 02:30:07,111
Come on..

2025
02:30:30,867 --> 02:30:32,608
You are not smart

2026
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:33,978
Why?

2027
02:30:34,001 --> 02:30:35,878
Even if you kill me..

2028
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:42,082
...that ship contains all the network
details to control the sleeper cells.

2029
02:30:43,134 --> 02:30:46,946
There are people
who will continue this.

2030
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:49,635
Wait.

2031
02:31:01,701 --> 02:31:02,907
Three..

2032
02:31:03,900 --> 02:31:05,072
Two..

2033
02:31:05,767 --> 02:31:07,041
One..

2034
02:31:08,300 --> 02:31:09,574
Boom!

2035
02:31:26,501 --> 02:31:27,980
You didn't understand, did you?

2036
02:31:30,934 --> 02:31:33,175
You should die in suspense.

2037
02:31:58,533 --> 02:32:01,673
If he would've said he liked
the girl the day he had come..

2038
02:32:01,734 --> 02:32:03,270
...we would got them
married before he left.

2039
02:32:03,534 --> 02:32:06,777
It's the same here.
But no one listens to us.

2040
02:32:06,834 --> 02:32:07,972
This boy I tell you..

2041
02:32:08,034 --> 02:32:09,274
Sir..
- He will never be serious in life.

2042
02:32:09,534 --> 02:32:10,604
Take care.

2043
02:32:10,734 --> 02:32:12,543
They make a superb couple,
don't they, sir?

2044
02:32:14,800 --> 02:32:21,274
You know, the reason
they are together today is me?

2045
02:32:21,734 --> 02:32:23,008
You, sir?

2046
02:32:25,467 --> 02:32:26,775
Yes.

2047
02:32:26,834 --> 02:32:31,647
Sir, the day we came here and
his father took him away in a hurry..

2048
02:32:31,900 --> 02:32:34,437
That was to introduce him to this girl.

2049
02:32:34,833 --> 02:32:37,643
He rejected her.
Then she rejected him.

2050
02:32:37,833 --> 02:32:39,972
And when they both consented.

2051
02:32:40,034 --> 02:32:44,449
Some idiot came in the
middle and confused everything.

2052
02:32:44,501 --> 02:32:46,811
But now everything is fine, sir.

2053
02:32:48,834 --> 02:32:53,476
But sir, why did you say that
you are the reason they are together?

2054
02:32:53,767 --> 02:32:56,043
The story you told me..

2055
02:32:56,434 --> 02:32:56,935
Sir.

2056
02:32:57,033 --> 02:33:00,537
The idiot you mentioned in it..

2057
02:33:00,634 --> 02:33:01,704
Yes, sir.

2058
02:33:02,600 --> 02:33:03,908
That's 'ME'.

2059
02:33:05,700 --> 02:33:06,940
Come to the camp..

2060
02:33:07,601 --> 02:33:08,170
Yes, sir.

2061
02:33:08,434 --> 02:33:10,505
I'll hang the two of you upside down.

2062
02:33:11,801 --> 02:33:13,144
No, sir..

2063
02:33:20,867 --> 02:33:22,813
Truly, army is great.

2064
02:33:25,534 --> 02:33:29,482
For the next 11 months,
on a snow-clad mountain.

2065
02:33:29,967 --> 02:33:34,416
Or in a desert, making your own tent,
cooking your own food..

2066
02:33:35,667 --> 02:33:38,648
Thinking about these 40-days holiday..

2067
02:33:40,467 --> 02:33:43,846
Keep looking at the family
photo tucked in the wallet.

2068
02:33:46,867 --> 02:33:49,108
This is how you'll
have to live, right?

2069
02:33:50,567 --> 02:33:52,672
I'll miss you.
- Take care.
