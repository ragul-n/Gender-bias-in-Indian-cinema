00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,530
Help me Action Kamen!

00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,080
Ahahahahaha!

4
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,120
Scream more! Cry more!

5
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,130
If you do that Action Kamen will come here.

6
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,050
And thus he would fall into the trap we've laid.

7
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,930
You coward!

8
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,810
Things won't go according to your plan!

9
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,900
Very well if you say so...

10
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,440
In exchange you will go through great agony.

11
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,710
Action Kamen transform!

12
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,640
Hahahahahahahaha!

13
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,600
Don't come Action Kamen! This is a trap!

14
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,060
It's too late.

15
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,650
Let go of her Skeleton Dr. Zonbiribi!

16
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,360
Get him!

17
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,160
B!

18
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,870
What are you going to do now Action Kamen?

19
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,630
Action Kamen!

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,210

21
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,940
B!

22
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,100
W-Was there an explosion in the script?

23
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,390
No of course not! Cut! Cut!

24
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,350
Oh no! Gou-san!

25
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,490
W- What are you doing?

26
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,890
I'll take the Action Stone.

27
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,650
Are you okay Gou-san?

28
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,980
Hey! He's over here!

29
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,610
Are you hurt Action Kamen?

30
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,780
Gou-san!

31
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,110
Get a grip of yourself Action Kamen!

32
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,830
I've twisted my ankle.

It's the chimpanzee general Monkeykey.

A villain card right?

66
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,560
Such a bummer I don't want it!

Uh... I don't have that many.

88
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,410
About 30?

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,670

About 50.

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,970

Same with number 33 Mimiko-chan's card.

110

00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,490
Ooh the beach!

679
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,790
Haigure...

680
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,540
Nee nee miss! Where are you from?

681
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,330

686

688
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,730
{\pos(360385)}I don't know why but I suddenly

689
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,730
feel like going to the beach.

690
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,760
Are you tired?

691
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,260
{\pos(360385)}If I was I wouldn't have

692
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,260

693
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,930
That's right then let me find my swimsuit!

694
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,680
Ooh mum I'm gonna wear a swimsuit too!

695
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,140

{\pos(360385)}Why does everybody want to

Japanese don't have any individuality!

706
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,090
Then what about us?

707
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,170
We're perfectly fine!

708
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:05,970
Why is that?

709
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,720
{\pos(360385)}That's because this is Japan!

710
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,720
That's because this is Japan!

711
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,640
Oh?

712
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,730
Action Beam! Bi- bi- bi- bi- bi- bi- bi--

713
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,230
Please don't act like that right now!

714
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,400
Okay okay I've GOT it!

715
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,860
I surrender!

716
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,580
Dad your acting is so surrealistic!

717
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,950
You mean realistic.

718
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:37,080
After all my Action Beam is third-to-none!

719
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,870
You mean second-to-none!

720
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,830
Wahahahahahahaha!

721
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,290
I'm starting to get irritated!

722
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,250
What a pain...

723
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,920
That's your fault!

724
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,260
Oh they started moving!

725
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,760
Alright let's go to the beach!

726
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,060
You're so worthless dad.

727
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,360
This is not my fault!

728
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,570
Argh I can't bear it any longer!

729
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,360
Wait dearest!

730
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,280
Where are you going?

731
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,700
You need to pee?

732
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,780
We are going to the beach!

733
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,320
Are you sure this will work?

734
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,660
Like I care!

735
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,560
Look Shinnosuke!

736
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,600
It's Action Kamen!

737
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,450
Where is that Action Kamen!?

738
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
Over there!

739
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,620
It's really Action Kamen...

740
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,470
Dad mum hurry up!

741
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,590
What's with that...

742
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,120
This is kind of creepy...

743
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,450
Yes... quite a bit.

744
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,330
Looks like nobody is here...

745
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,250
Ah Shinnosuke!

746
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,590

747
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,420
Shinnosuke!

748
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,600
Ooh-ho!

00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,730
Welcome Nohara Shinnosuke-kun!

750
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,400
Don't need to...

751
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:07,860
Oh?

752
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,940
Welcome it's great that you have arrived.

753
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,610
How do you know my name!?

754
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:17,410
That means... I'm that populaaaar?

755
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,780
Of course.

756
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,120
Shinnosuke!

757
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,830
Don't run around like that!

758
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:34,800
Welcome to the Action Kamen Attraction Land.

759
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,760
Where do we buy the tickets for admittance?

760
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,730
{\pos(360385)}I think that you have already

761
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,730
acquired that ticket for admittance.

762
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,100
Oh?

763
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,320
Can I use this?

764
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,900
You can't use that as a ticket!

765
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,320
Sorry about that!

766
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,780
Yes that is it. Please follow me.

767
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,580
Hey where did you get that?

768
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,700
That was a free prize...

769
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,950
E- Excuse me!

770
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,050
Maybe it's better if we would return.

771
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,640
What? This looks like fun and it's also free!

772
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,260
Well if you put it that way...

773
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,070
Eeh! It looks pretty impressive.

774
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:38,320
{\pos(360385)}This is the Space-Time Machine

775
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:38,320

776
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,450
How interesting!

777
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,370
Please come in.

778
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,370
Sure sure.

781
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,130
I think this is one of those 360° theatres.

782
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,260
Alright! Then I am going to sit in front!

783
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,010
Ooh but that's my seat!

784
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,180
Oh come on now!

785
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,890
This is honestly free of charge right?

786

{\pos(360385)}So stingy!

787

I shall see you later.

792
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,950

00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,890
The kindergarten bus is quite late...

856
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,140
It is late for 30 minutes now.

857
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,430
Misaeeee!

858
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,930
Big trouble!

859
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,310
What's wrong dearest?

860
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:23,610
{\pos(360385)}Something is definitely not right

861
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:23,610
here. Everybody everybody...

862
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,570
What's wrong... ?

863
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,190
Everybody is wearing swimsuits!

864
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:31,200
Ooh-ho! Haigure!

865
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,450
Oh come now don't come with such a bad joke!

866
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:37,540
I'm NOT joking I'm telling the truth here!

867
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,700
That can't be.

868
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,620
What do you think about swimsuits dad?

869
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,420
That's...

870
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,590
{\pos(360385)}Looking at the young girls wearing

871
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,590
those suits makes me very happy!

872
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,090
You two...

873
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,550
{\pos(360385)}Ehehehehe!

874
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,550
Ehehehehe!

875
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,560
Dad!

876
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,560
{\pos(360385)}Dearest!

877
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,700
What the...

878
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,110
Watch out! Action Bird Gum Pistol!

879
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,670
I did it...

880
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:32,130
{\pos(360385)}Ooh! Its Mimiko-oneesan

881
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:32,130
from the Action Kamen Show!

882
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,550
Filming these days seems ridiculous!

883
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:37,050
Please I need your help!

884
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,270
Oh where are the cameras at?

885
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,520
You are a lot cuter in real life!

886
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,520
Hey Mimiko-chan are you a natto or onion type?

887
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,570
Could  you all listen to what I've got to say first?

888
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:53,030
My name is Ririko Action Kamen's cute sidekick.

889
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,490
Sakura Ririko!

890
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,540
Oh if you all thought that I was Mimiko...

891
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,910
Could it be that you all...

892
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:05,920
Please sign this for me!

893
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,880
That card!

894
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,300
Then you must be Shinnosuke-kun!

895
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,590
I'm Nohara Shinnosuke indeed.

896
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:17,890
I never thought you would know me.

897
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,180
I'm so attacked!

898
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,310
You mean "deeply touched".

899
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:24,560
Same thing!

900
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,480
I wonder if Mimiko found the wrong person...

901
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,440
Ririko-kun!

902
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:40,160
{\pos(360385)}Kitakasukabe-hakase!

903
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:40,160
Get a hold of yourself! Hakase!

904
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,080
Are you okay?

905
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,210
Do we need to call the ambulance?

906
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:50,800
It's n- no problem. I just really-- need to go...

907
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,460
Please lend us your WC!

908
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,680
So uncool...

909
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:07,140

Fuhahaha! Please report.

913
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:20,700
{\pos(360385)}Yes. I have lost contact with the underlings

914
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:20,700
that were tracking down Kitakasukabe-hakase.

915
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:25,500
{\pos(360385)}Mao-sama please give us the order

916
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:25,500
so we three sisters can assault them!

917
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,460
Hold that thought!

918
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:33,210
Leave this problem to me Bikini Thong Man!

919
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:39,140
Alright. Then go quickly Baron Bikini Thong!

920
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,220
{\i1}To all citizens in the country{\i0}

921

{\i1\pos(360385)}Currently Tokyo is under attack from{\i0}

922
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:45,060
{\i1}aliens and is facing a big crisis.{\i0}

923
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:50,020
I have managed to avoid the alien's attack

924
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,650
Up until now and also managed to infiltrate inside.

925
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,070
This is the scene that is in front of me. Look!

926
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:07,540
Haigure haigure haigure haigure!...

927
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,540
{\pos(360385)}Aah! This is exactly what I saw!

928
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,710
Aah! This is exactly what I saw!

929
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,500
Then what you said was true!?

930
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,670
{\pos(360385)}It looks like this part of town

931
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,670
has also gotten attacked.

932
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,170
{\i1}Daagh I was spotted!{\i0}

933
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:20,590
Everyone over there I'm doomed!

934
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:24,970
I'm- I'm-- S- s- s- save me Action Kameeen!

935
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,230
Hohohohohoho listen well earthlings

936
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,990
{\pos(360385)}It would be in your best interest

937
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,990
if you all let yourself get hit by our haigure rays.

938
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:42,490
And if you went "haigure" after that.

939
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,990
Haigure haigure haigure haigure!

940
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,660
Let us all wear a swimsuit!

941
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,830
Poor guy...

942
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:53,710
Since when did things become like that?

943
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,300
It has almost been three weeks.

944
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:59,880
{\pos(360385)}On that day it suddenly appeared

945
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:59,880
from outer space.

946
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:21,110
{\pos(360385)}From there the haigure rays turned everyone

947
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:21,110
one by one into haigure chanting people.

948
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:22,860
Haigure haigure haigure!

949
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:25,030
Even though the government

950
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,830
{\pos(360385)}Sent its best forces to try

951
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,830
to eliminate this threat

952
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:30,410
{\pos(360385)}It was to no avail since the enemy's

953
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:30,410
technology level was so far ahead of ours.

954
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:34,380
{\pos(360385)}For the moment on all fronts of

955
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:34,380
warfare we have been losing to them.

956
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,380
{\pos(360385)}But but how come we have never

957
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,380
heard of any of these things?

958
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:42,260
{\pos(360385)}Well of course you wouldn't know!

959
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:42,260
You are not from this world after all.

960
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,260
{\pos(360385)}Ha...?

961
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,260
Ha...?

962
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,850
Somebody's in here!

963
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:50,600
Oh-hoo.

964
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,270
SOMEBODY's in here!

965
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:54,940
Oh-hoo.

966
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,570
Oh it's a candy!

967
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:13,500
It's not sweet...

968
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:20,460
{\pos(360385)}You have been chosen as Action Warriors

969
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:20,460
and you were sent from another world.

970
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,340
Another world?

971
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,420
To come to this world?

972
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,590
Looks like I've got to explain this...

973
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:32,560
{\pos(360385)}There seems to be one earth in this

974
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:32,560
universe but actually that is not true.

975
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,560
In another dimension there is another Earth.

976
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:41,400
{\pos(360385)}These two earths can't tell most

977
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:41,400
of the time if they exist or not.

978
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,360
{\pos(360385)}However with a card and

979
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,360
stone it can create a portal

980
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:46,360
{\pos(360385)}Through which you can freely

981
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:46,360
travel through the worlds.

982
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:55,250
For the sake of this world

983
00:53:55,290 --> 00:54:00,670
{\pos(360385)}We have kept asking Action Kamen for aid

984
00:53:55,290 --> 00:54:00,670
but the stones' power was too weak.

985
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,130
{\pos(360385)}So we could only randomly choose

986
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,130
a family with that special card.

987
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,010
T- That can't be...

988
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:11,560
That that means Action Kamen is...

989
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,730
{\pos(360385)}That's correct it's because

990
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,730
Action Kamen is taking

991
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:17,060
{\pos(360385)}Part in the Action Kamen Show

992
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:17,060
he has gone to your world.

993
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:22,020
{\pos(360385)}Then that means the Action

994
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:22,020
Kamen we see on telly is real!

995
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:32,580
I knew that Action Kamen was real!

996
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,790
{\pos(360385)}You didn't know don't take

997
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,790
advantage of the situation!

998
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,960
This sounds like the script from a manga...

999
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,000
Yes it is so outdated...

1000
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,800
Owowow!

1001
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,710
{\pos(360385)}It hurts so it's real...

1002
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,710
It hurts so it's real...

1003
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,840
Everything is real here!

1004
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,010
Please trust what I Sakurada Ririko have said!

1005
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:53,350
Oh? Aren't you Mimiko-chan?

1006
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:56,350
{\pos(360385)}I'm going to repeat myself

1007
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:56,350
I'm Sakura Ririko.

1008
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:58,850
Mimiko is my sister and we're twins.

1009
00:54:58,850 --> 00:54:59,980
Oh-hoo!

1010
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,730
BIG TROUBLE!

1011
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:05,990
{\pos(360385)}The Action Stone from the case that

1012
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:05,990
I disguised as a candy has disappeared!

1013
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:09,070
And I only went for the WC for a bit too!

1014
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:11,160
It must have been stolen!

1015
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,160
Did you SEE IT little boy?

1016
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:18,120
I swallowed it...

1017
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,880
Has ANYONE Seen the Action Stone!

1018
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,460
It looks exactly the same as a candy!

1019
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,880
I know I know I know!

1020
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,090
Where where where?

1021
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:30,050
I ate it...

1022
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,180
What did you say!?

1023
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,260
Without it Action Kamen will no longer

1024
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,020
Be able to return to this world anymore!

1025
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,020
{\pos(360385)}Whaaat!?

1026
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,020
Whaaat!?

1027
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:41,900
{\an8}Also without that you guys can't go

1028
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:41,900
{\an8\pos(36025)}back to your own world either...

1029

Oh-hoo...

What have you done...

1033
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,740
No need to praise me!

1034
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,740
We aren't praising you...

1035
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:05,790
{\pos(360385)}Our fence! We still got 32 years of

00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:05,790
loan that we still have to pay for!

1037
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:09,800
{\pos(360385)}But... it's not like this is our real house.

1038
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:09,800
It shouldn't matter at all!

1039
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,880
Eh... oh right.

1040
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:12,890
Sorry I'm late.

1041
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,680
Kumichou your face is scary.

1042
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,390
I'm not Kumichou I'm Enchou!

1043
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:23,150
{\pos(360385)}I was born with this apparence

1044
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:23,150
and I can't do anything about it.

1045
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:26,110
Oooh-ho!

1046
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,690
{\pos(360385)}Ah Enchou-sensei these two are

1047
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,690
Sakura Ririko and Kitakasukabe-hakase.

1048
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:34,950
{\pos(360385)}Hakase Ririko-chan this is

1049
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:34,950
Enchou-sensei from Futaba kindergarten!

1050
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:35,570
Ah nice to meet you...

1051
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:36,910
Enchou-sensei!

1052
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:41,540
{\pos(360385)}This area is very dangerous let's hurry up

1053
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:41,540
and take the kids to a safer location!

1054
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,040
Ririko let's go with them.

1055
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,210
Yes hakase!

1056
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:46,880
Darling we should go too!

1057
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,000
Yes we should.

1058
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:54,970
Then let's DO!

1059
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:58,180
You mean let's go...

1060
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,890
You can put it that way too!

1061
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:00,720
Oh?

1062
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:03,020
What's wrong Shin-chan?

1063
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,230
I'm going to bring Shiro with us!

1064
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,060
Geez...

1065
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:10,280
Now now this means he is a good hearted kid.

1066
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,150
{\pos(360385)}Oh he's nothing like that!

1067
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,150
Oh he's nothing like that!

1068
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,160
I-- am Baron Bikini Thong!

1069
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,830
Kitakasukabe-hakase I've found you!

1070
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:30,210
{\pos(360385)}Now give me that one remaining Action Stone

1071
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:30,210
or else I'm going to use this to take care of you.

1072
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,050
What's going on?

1073
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:35,090
{\pos(360385)}That is one of the Haigure Mao's

1074
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:35,090
underlings Baron Bikini Thong.

1075
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:40,640
{\pos(360385)}He is a cruel and heartless gay guy who

1076
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:40,640
would do anything to get what he wants!

1077
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:45,770
{\pos(360385)}If you don't hand me the Action

1078
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:45,770
Stone after I count to 3...

1079
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,730
One!

1080
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,150
Two!

1081
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,110
One--

1082
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,070
Ooh?

1083
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:59,280
Shin-chan hurry up!

1084
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,990
Okaaaay!

1085
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:05,040
{\pos(360385)}Enchou-sensei this is our chance!

1086
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:05,040
Please hurry up and let us get out of here!

1087
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:05,710
Understood!

1088
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,590
Don't try to escape!

1089
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,560
Didn't I just say? You can't escape from me!

1090
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,650
Oooh...

1091
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:34,150
Hehehehe isn't it scary eh?

1092
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,820
Zou-san power!

1093
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:40,450
Oh nooooo!

1094
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:43,620
{\pos(360385)}Shoot! I can't believe he used

1095
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:43,620
such a underhanded tactic.

1096
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,290
I'm going to catch you now!

1097
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:46,790
Stop right there

1098
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:49,420
Eh oh Haigure Mao-sama!

1099
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,840
Let them go there is no need to chase them.

1100
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,130
But! If we catch them now--

1101
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,050
SHUT UP! Don't go against my orders.

1102
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:00,800
{\pos(360385)}Do you want to know the

1103
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:00,800
consequences of someone who does that?

1104
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:06,390
Please forgive me Haigure Mao-sama...

1105
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:12,690
Thank you Shinnosuke-kun you saved us!

1106
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,230
I already knew that this would be the outcome!

1107
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:17,690
So that's why I drew a Zou-san on my wee wee!

1108
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,410
Zou-san Zou-san!

1109
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:22,950
Your nose is so looong!

1110
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,990
{\pos(360385)}We should scold him but...

1111
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,160
Now now now.

1112
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:28,000
Then what should we do next hakase?

1113
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,830
{\pos(360385)}Anyway let's hurry back

1114
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,830
to our secret lab first.

1115
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:37,670
{\pos(360385)}And we must also give Shinnosuke an

1116
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:37,670
enema to obtain the Action Stone!

1117
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:39,680
Enema... you say?

1118
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:43,510
That's right an enema.

1119
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:46,430
Please stop!

1120
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,690
Thank goodness!

1121
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,980
Matsuzaka-sensei!

1122
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,980
{\pos(360385)}Matsuzaka-sensei!

1123
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:58,360
{\an8}When I was  at the kindergarten

1124
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:58,360
{\an8\pos(36025)}I was attacked by the haigure aliens.

1125
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,700
{\an8}Who is that?

1126
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,700
{\an8}Matsuzaka-sensei from our kindergarten

1127
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,450
{\an8}Because of her bad temper

1128
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,450
{\an8\pos(36025)}she can't get a boyfriend.

1129
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:06,580
{\an8}I can hear you you little...

1130
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:06,990
{\an8}Oh?

1131
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,460
Matsuzaka-sensei what happened to my wife?

1132
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:12,290
{\an8}S- She...

1133
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:16,670
{\an8}She was attacked by those haigure

1134
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:16,670
{\an8\pos(36025)}aliens so now she's doing that too!

1135
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,880
Haigure haigure HAIGURE!

1136
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:21,470
At her age... this is so horrible.

1137
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,300
It is all my fault...

1138
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,510
Ah no... it's not your fault...

1139
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:29,020
Speaking of that where are we heading now?

1140
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,350
Where should we go?

1141
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:35,360
{\pos(360385)}Let's head towards my secret lab

1142
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:35,360
that is the safest place right now.

1143
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:38,320
That's great!

1144
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:02,090
Haigure haigure haigure!

1145
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,050
Haigure haigure haigure!

1146
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:09,060
Fuhahahaha! It looks like everybody is here.

1147
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:14,520
{\pos(360385)}My three sisters proceed with

1148
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:14,520
Earth's conquering projects

1149
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,520
How are we doing so far?

1150
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:19,070
{\an8}Yes currently the population of Tokyo

1151
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:21,650
{\an8}Has mostly been transformed into haigure chanters.

1152
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:28,450
{\an8}Our next target is Saitama Chiba

1153
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:28,450
{\an8\pos(36025)}will also soon be under our control.

1154
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:34,410
{\pos(360385)}In the next few days the entire population of Japan

1155
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:34,410
will become the servants of you Haigure Mao-sama!

1156
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:36,750
Isn't that nice!

1157
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,710
What about you Baron Bikini Thong?

1158
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:41,670
If you hadn't ordered me to stop back then

1159
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:46,180
{\pos(360385)}I would have caught Kitakasukabe

1160
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:46,180
and gotten the Action Stone!

1161
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,640
Why did you stop me Mao-sama!?

1162
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:59,820
Bikini Thong are you complaining to me?

1163
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:05,860
{\pos(360385)}I decide how we operate

1164
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:05,860
you just follow your orders!

1165
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,280
If you don't listen to what I say then...

1166
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:11,620
P- Please stop Haigure Mao-sama!

1167
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,120
How shameful!

1168
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,290
SHUT UP!

1169
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:22,300
Geez you people have such low standards!

1170
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,720
{\pos(360385)}Listen carefully I think most

1171
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,720
of you should know by now

1172
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:30,970
{\pos(360385)}There is only one person who can

1173
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:30,970
stand up against me right now.

1174
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:34,470
I don't have to say it Action Kamen is the one.

1175
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:38,480
Once we obtained the Action Stone

1176
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,440
{\pos(360385)}Action Kamen will never be able to come

1177
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,440
back to this world ever again hehehe.

1178
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:51,120
{\pos(360385)}But right now Kitakasukabe-hakase and his allies

1179
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:51,120
could be able to create an entirely new Action Stone.

1180
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,830
Hehehehehe!

1181
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:58,330
{\pos(360385)}That's why we should find their secret

1182
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:58,330
lab first. THEN we'll kill all of them

1183
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:03,170
{\pos(360385)}And we will be able to obtain the

1184
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:03,170
new Action Stone that way.

1185
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:08,260
But... how do we find their secret lab?

1186
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:13,390
{\pos(360385)}We have already thought up a plan

1187
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:13,390
you don't have to worry about that!

1188
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:17,140
Leave this mission up to us the three sisters!

1189
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:19,060
Damn those three...

1190
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:22,860
{\pos(360385)}Bikini Thong you will stay

1191
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:22,860
here to watch over the castle.

1192
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:27,490
{\pos(360385)}Bellyband sisters go and

1193
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:27,490
completely annihilate them!

1194
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:44,130
Here we are.

1195
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,440
Eh this is so cool!

1196
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,480
So this is Action Kamen's secret HQ.

1197
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:09,570
Ah so this is what it looks like from the inside.

1198
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:10,360
Ah?

1199
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,240
What's wrong?

1200
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,330
H- Hakase we're in big trouble!

1201
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:19,500
{\pos(360385)}The enemy has gathered a large number of

1202
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:19,500
troops that are currently heading our way!

1203
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,910
H- How did they know!?

1204
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:23,380
Nevermind just activate the barrier!

1205
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,210
Barrier!

1206
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,340
The protective shield that I Kitakasukabe invented

1207
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:36,890
Won't be broken from the outside so easily! Haha!

1208
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:38,390
This is so amazing hakase!

1209
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:42,100
By the way where is the Action Stone?

1210
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:45,360
{\pos(360385)}Right now it's in the

1211
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:45,360
stomach of this boy.

1212
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:48,820
Eh? It's in Shinnosuke-kun's stomach?

1213
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:52,030
It's not like that at all!

1214
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:55,660
Wait how come you know about the Action Stone?

1215
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,540
That's what Mrs. Yoshinaga told me...

1216
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,120
I don't know anything about that!

1217
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,620
I have been suspicious of you from the start!

1218
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,170
{\pos(360385)}Since I have been uncovered

1219
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,170
I suppose I have no choice...

1220
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,630
{\pos(360385)}That's right I'm the spy sent

1221
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,630
by the Bellyband sisters!

1222
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:15,470
Haigure haigure haigure!

1223
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,350
Barrier deactivated!

1224
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,490
The Bellyband sisters

1225
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,290
Have arrived!

1226
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,920
That's soo sexy!

1227
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,840
You mean that's soo scary!

1228
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,510
{\pos(360385)}Alright let's change all of them

1229
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,510
into haigure chanters as well!

1230
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:59,760
Haigure haigure haigure!

1231
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:04,730
Haigure haigure haigure!

1232
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:08,730
Oh no! Ririko-kun you have to save Shinnosuke!

1233
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:09,440
Yes!

1234
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,400
Haigure haigure haigure haigure...

1235
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,400
{\pos(360385)}Haigure haigure haigure!

1236
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,860
Haigure haigure haigure!

1237
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:18,410
Over here!

1238
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,240
{\pos(360385)}Dad!

1239
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,240
Dearest!

1240
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,240
Haigure haigure haigure!

1241
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,290
Hurry up now!

1242
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:29,250
{\pos(360385)}If we want to save everyone

1243
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:29,250
we have to leave now!

1244
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:31,540
You shall not pass!

1245
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:35,720
Haigure haigure...

1246
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,760
Hakase ...

1247
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:49,600
What should we do now...

1248
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:55,780
There is only one thing we can do.

1249
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,320
{\pos(360385)}Currently the Demon Lord's

1250
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,320
Ship is stationed at Shinjuku.

1251
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,780
That is where our two worlds connect

1252
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:07,120
{\pos(360385)}If we can bring the Action Stone there Action

1253
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:07,120
Kamen would be able to come back to this world.

1254
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:12,000
{\pos(360385)}That means Action Kamen can

1255
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:12,000
teach this Haigure Mao a lesson!

1256
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,130
How do we get from here to Shinjuku then?

1257
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:17,630
Shinnosuke-kun can I borrow your card?

1258
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:30,730
{\pos(360385)}This is the Super Tricycle that

1259
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:30,730
Kitakasukabe-hakase invented.

1260
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:34,150
{\pos(360385)}Not only can it fly it also

1261
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:34,150
has three special abilities.

1262
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,320
A trycicle?

1263
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:40,700
{\pos(360385)}Yes the only drawback is that

1264
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:40,700
it can't carry more than 30kg.

1265
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:45,910
I will go then!

1266
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:48,710
I want to help Action Kamen!

1267
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,750
Let's DO!

1268
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,790
It's "Let's Go"!

1269
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:55,130
You can put it that way too!

1270
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:59,300
{\pos(360385)}Shinnosuke-kun wear this helmet

1271
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:59,300
it has automatic settings on it.

1272
01:07:59,300 --> 01:07:59,880
Okay!

1273
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:08,350
Alright Let's go Shin-chan!

1274
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:10,270
Shiro can talk!

1275
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:12,440
{\pos(360385)}It is only because of the

1276
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:12,440
tricycle. Alright let's depart!

1277
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,350
Oh-hoo!

1278
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,110
Shinnosuke!

1279
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:16,070
Be careful Shinnosuke!

1280
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,030
I'm going off Misae!

1281
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:21,990
Answer me properly!

1282
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,950
Be careful Shinnosuke!

1283
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:25,910
I'm going off mama!

1284
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:47,890
Leader!

1285
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:53,310
{\pos(360385)}According to our radar

1286
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:53,310
someone has escaped from the laboratory!

1287
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:56,230
They must have taken the Action Stone and ran!

1288
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:58,230
Okay! Then let's chase them.

1289
01:08:58,270 --> 01:08:59,570
Rodger!

1290
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:04,740
Haigure haigure haigure haigure!

1291
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:12,580
Shiro what should we do now?

1292
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,330
No matter what we must reach Shinjuku first!

1293
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:17,210
{\pos(360385)}And then we have to retrieve the

1294
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:17,210
Action Stone from your stomach.

1295
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:20,920
{\pos(360385)}Then combine it with the Action

1296
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:20,920
Card to call out Action Kamen.

1297
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:27,010
{\pos(360385)}Shiro when did you gain this air

1298
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:27,010
of superiority when talking to me?

1299
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,110
{\pos(360385)}Shin-chan watch it there is something

1300
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,110
approaching us from the back!

1301
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,390
Uaah my butt is completely visible!

1302
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:08,930
That hurts!

1303
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,680
Shiro Shiro I can't take much more of this!

1304
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:16,730
{\pos(360385)}Hold on I'm checking if there

1305
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:16,730
are any weapons that we can use!

1306
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:20,020
I got it Shin-chan!

1307
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:22,610
{\pos(360385)}Are there three buttons in the

1308
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:22,610
middle of the steering wheel?

1309
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:23,990
There are!

1310
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:25,610
Press the blue one!

1311
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:35,000
That's so cool Shiro! You're the best!

1312
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,660
What kind of weapon was that?

1313
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,750
I think it was just a smoke screen.

1314
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:40,500
Smoke screen?

1315
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:51,220
Shiro! Shiro!

1316
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,430
Try out the yellow button fast!

1317
01:10:58,190 --> 01:10:59,600
It's so preverted!

1318
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,690
You mean it transforms...

1319
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,650
I didn't know that it could turn into a zou-san...

1320
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,320
Ooh-ho!

1321
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,820
Zou-san zou-san!

1322
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:14,580
Your nose is so loooong!

1323
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:15,910
Oh?

1324
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:20,500
How can I use this elephant!?

1325
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,590
Press the last button Shin-chan!

1326
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:34,930
{\pos(360385)}Leader there is no way that we can

1327
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:34,930
catch up them with them at that speed.

1328
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:36,310
Let's just go back...

1329
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:38,850
{\pos(360385)}How can you say that?

1330
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:38,850
If we return empty handed

1331
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:41,480
Who knows how Haigure Mao will punish us!

1332
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,440
This must be so tiring for you leader!

1333
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,400
Oh look!

1334
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,860
He came back. We must catch him this time!

1335
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:48,490
Rodger!

1336
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:53,410
{\pos(360385)}You must calm down Shin-chan

1337
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:53,410
take reigns of the steering wheel!

1338
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:55,990
{\pos(360385)}You are a dog Shiro don't

1339
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:55,990
sound so high and mighty!

1340
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,840
Let's put an end to this! Full throttle!

1341
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:16,760
{\pos(360385)}Leader we can't pursue him any longer

1342
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:16,760
the engine is going to overheat!

1343
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,140
{\pos(360385)}The auto-balancer is starting

1344
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,140
to show signs of break-down!

1345
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,480
Do your best everyone!

1346
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,350
Oh-hoo!

1347
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,620
Leader...

1348
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:37,580
Don't tell me that next...

1349
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,080
We're going to fall...

1350
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:43,580
Hold steady everyone!

1351
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:49,670
Okay!

1352
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:56,760
{\pos(360385)}Leader... is there any reason for

1353
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:56,760
holding hands at this moment?

1354
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,060
I just think that we look better this way.

1355
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,690
Saveee us!

1356
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,860
It's you!

1357
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,530
Is it really you that saved us?

1358
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,320
Y- y- yes...

1359
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:18,240
Thank you Shin-chan!

1360
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:20,620
Ah it wasn't that much!

1361
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:23,830
Nee nee are you a natto or onion type?

1362
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:27,170
{\pos(360385)}Shin-chan we don't have

1363
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:27,170
the time to do such things...

1364
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:32,380
{\pos(360385)}Chi for a pet you sure don't

1365
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:32,380
understand how your master feels Shiro.

1366
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:35,010
{\pos(360385)}Of course I understand

1367
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:35,010
I just don't want to accept.

1368
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:37,680
You're talking non-sense now!

1369
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:40,970
Then 'bye see you some other time!

1370
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:50,230
It looks like not all earthlings are so bad...

1371
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:51,650
True true!

1372
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:55,610
{\pos(360385)}Guess you're right but I wonder if

1373
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:55,610
that child can beat Baron Bikini Thong.

1374
01:13:56,780 --> 01:14:00,660
Ooh! I can see it Shiro!

1375
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:21,930
Who ARE you!?

1376
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:27,190
I'm Baron Bikini Thong!

1377
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:30,360
Hand over that Action Stone!

1378
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:33,530
No we will never give it to you!

1379
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:37,070
{\pos(360385)}Shiro I was supposed to say that

1380
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:37,070
line but you said it before me!

1381
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:39,620
You're so unfair!

1382
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,700
Sorry...

1383
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,870
{\pos(360385)}You are one troublesome dog

1384
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,870
now I've got no lines to say!

1385
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:46,790
Hey you! Listen when other people talk!

1386
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:50,250
Now hand over the Action Stone!

1387
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,470
Hey hey! Wait!

1388
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:57,970
HEY!

1389
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:09,310
That's it I had it with you!

1390
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,230
Bikini Thong!

1391
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:28,500
Lock on!

1392
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:31,500
Fire!

1393
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:37,670
You will never escape this homing missile!

1394
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:44,600
{\pos(360385)}It just has to touch you

1395
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:44,600
and then it will EXPLODE!

1396
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:53,650
Dodge it! Dodge it! Dodge it!

1397
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:18,260
Shin-chan I don't think we'll be able to fly much...

1398
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,810
Shiro are you okay?

1399
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:34,480
I'm fine but... The trycycle isn't.

1400
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:40,780
{\pos(360385)}I won't be able to talk anymore soon.

1401
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:40,780
So I won't be able to help you either...

1402
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:43,700
Don't worry about it Shiro just wait here then.

1403
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,700
{\pos(360385)}I will go forth alone in my

1404
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,700
quest to help Action Kamen!

1405
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:49,660
You're a good boy Shin-chan...

1406
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:51,660
I'm nothing like that!

1407
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:55,710
Then I'm off I'll come back to pick you up later!

1408
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:58,420
Heey!

1409
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:00,130
Heeeey!

1410
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:03,800
Heey-heeey!

1411
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:10,350
I have no idea where to go...

1412
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:14,190
What a pain... what a pain!

1413
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:17,770
{\pos(360385)}There's no one to help me here

1414
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:17,770
and I don't know what to do either!

1415
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:19,730
What's the matter little boy?

1416
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:21,690
Who is it? Who is here?

1417
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:23,070
Over here over here.

1418
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:27,910
Who are you?

1419
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:31,370
I'm a cute puppet what are you doing here?

1420
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:34,870
Me? I'm here to defeat Haigure Mao!

1421
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:39,000
{\pos(360385)}That is indeed quite impressive.

1422
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:39,000
Do you need my help to get you there?

1423
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:39,840
Where to?

1424
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,460
To where Haigure Mao is.

1425
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:42,670
Take me there!

1426
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:43,760
Follow me.

1427
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,130
Okay!

1428
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:56,690
Hello little boy.

1429
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,700
Wow! What a pretty woman!

1430
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:14,540
I caught you now!

1431
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:18,130
Ehehe I've been caught!

1432
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:19,960
Why is this little guy so strange?

1433
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:23,630
I'm not a strange little guy I'm Shinnosuke!

1434
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,430
You're not a woman!

1435
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:31,720
Is that a bad thing? I'm an okama!

1436
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,480
Ugh I don't like it no no!

1437
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:38,230
I'm Haigure Mao.

1438
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:40,820
No no no!

1439
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:43,030
I'm the ruler of this planet!

1440
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:44,240
Noooo!

1441
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:49,820
{\pos(360385)}So my intuition was right the Action

1442
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:49,820
Stone is in you stomach isn't it?

1443
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:51,740
Now give it to me!

1444
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:00,790
I'll take this.

1445
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,550
Obliterated!

1446
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:12,300
{\pos(360385)}Without the Action Stone Action

1447
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:12,300
Kamen will never return to this world!

1448
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,600
Well isn't that great?

1449
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,600
Idiot idiot! You're an idiot Haigure Mao!

1450
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:23,820
Action Stone...

1451
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:27,650
{\pos(360385)}That's right this is the

1452
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:27,650
other one that I have stolen.

1453
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:28,740
Didn't you know?

1454
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:34,450
{\pos(360385)}If you hold on to the stone while yelling

1455
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:34,450
"Action Kamen!" then he will appear?

1456
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:37,040
But that's not possible now.

1457
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:40,500
Because you're trapped within my grasps!

1458
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,050
Stop right there!

1459
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:56,430
Where are you going?

1460
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:58,430
T- To the bathroom...

1461
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,770
Don't try to lie to me!

1462
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:03,310
Save me Action Kamen!

1463
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:04,770
Oh?

1464
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:11,660
Dargh I lost!

1465
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:20,580
Sorry for waiting Shinnosuke-kun!

1466
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:23,000
Action Kamen!

1467
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,550
Now let us finish this Haigure Mao!

1468
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,670
Guess I have no choice...

1469
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:31,300
You still got here eh Action Kamen?

1470
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:36,600
{\pos(360385)}It can't be helped... so shall

1471
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:36,600
we do a climbing contest?

1472
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:40,020
{\pos(360385)}Whoever gets to the top first

1473
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:40,020
wins if I lose I will leave Earth.

1474
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:40,940
How does that sound?

1475
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:43,020
A climbing contest?

1476
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:46,020
That's fair let's do it!

1477
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,820
Action Kamen...

1478
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,650
Don't worry I got this covered.

1479
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:55,120
{\pos(360385)}I say Shinnosuke-kun can you hold

1480
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:55,120
this Action Stone in your hand?

1481
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:59,330
{\pos(360385)}It's a bit embarrassing if I pop out

1482
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:59,330
of your trousers every time ...

1483
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:00,500
Okay!

1484
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:03,460
Listen up whoever gets to the top of this statue

1485
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:06,960
And presses the button is the winner!

1486
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:12,510
This is a completely fair competition between us men.

1487
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:14,010
Are you pleased?

1488
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:14,800
Very good.

1489
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,220
Ready go!

1490
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:21,230
Ruuuuusssssh!

1491
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:30,230
What the-- ?

1492
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,360
That's enough you idiot!

1493
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,870
Oh shoot this isn't the path!

1494
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:48,460
{\pos(360385)}Hee hee hee that's so

1495
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:48,460
fitting for you Action Kamen!

1496
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:50,090
What did you say!?

1497
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,300
Action Kamen now's your chance!

1498
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:58,890
Alright!

1499
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:00,470
You cheater!

1500
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:06,810
That is...

1501
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:09,440
Looks like it's a draw.

1502
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,320
Since neither of us won...

1503
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:18,660
{\pos(360385)}Then let's decide this with our

1504
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:18,660
sword skills! What do you think?

1505
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:20,580
I can't ask for anything better.

1506
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:00,450
I thought you've only got that Action Beam move

1507
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:02,530
But your sword skills aren't too bad either.

1508
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:04,580
For the sake of protecting the Earth

1509
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:06,960
{\pos(360385)}I've disciplined myself with

1510
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:06,960
all forms of martial arts.

1511
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,710
You are quite an interesting guy.

1512
01:23:09,710 --> 01:23:12,000
How's this then!?

1513
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:23,560
I'm going to fight for real now!

1514
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:24,850
I'll do so too!

1515
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:42,530
{\pos(360385)}You will never be able to defeat

1516
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:42,530
me if all you do is defend!

1517
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:50,920
Watch out Action Kamen!

1518
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:55,750
Take this!

1519
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:06,770
Looky looky!

1520
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:07,430
Eh?

1521
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:16,440
What a hillarious faceeeeeeeeee--!

1522
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:21,200
Action Kamen why are you saving him?

1523
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,820
He is a really bad guy!

1524
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:25,950
{\pos(360385)}We have already agreed that we

1525
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:25,950
settle this with our sword skills.

1526
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:28,830
If I win like this I can't call myself a man.

1527
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,870
Ooh-hoo!

1528
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:37,300
{\pos(360385)}I'll make you understand that

1529
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:37,300
kindness will be your downfall!

1530
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,800
What rights do you have in teaching me leasons?

1531
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,150
Haigure Mao you've lost this time.

1532
01:24:58,190 --> 01:25:03,280
I understand Action Kamen. I have indeed lost...

1533
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:08,540
{\pos(360385)}But if that is what you were expecting

1534
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:08,540
me to say then you are sadly mistaken!

1535
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:11,500
This is very unmanly of you Haigure Mao!

1536
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:16,290
{\pos(360385)}Oh I'm so very sorry I'm

1537
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:16,290
not a man in the first place!

1538
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:18,500
I'm an o-ka-ma!

1539
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:29,850
Action Kamen use your Action Beam!

1540
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:33,350
Action Beam!

1541
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:42,570
What you are trying to do here? It's too much!

1542
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:45,030
{\pos(360385)}Didn't we agree on that you

1543
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:45,030
don't use the Action Beam?

1544
01:25:58,790 --> 01:26:00,550
S- Shinnosuke-kun!

1545
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:04,380
