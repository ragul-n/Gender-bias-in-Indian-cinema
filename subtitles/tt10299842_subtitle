1
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,500
Sir! We're almost there.

2
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,500
We will be arriving soon.

3
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,083
<i>Raj! Received another call
from the crime scene.</i>

4
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,416
<i>They heard a gunshot, it seems.
Make sure you handle this carefully.</i>

5
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,583
Sir! We've found a gray Myvi.

6
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,333
There's nobody in the car.

7
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,500
Do you want us to check...

8
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,125
- Hello?
- Madam! We got Aishwarya.

9
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,208
<i>Where was she caught?</i>

10
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,875
She was caught at Kapar.

11
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,875
She was holding a gun
in her hands when caught.

12
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,375
We're still investigating
the identities of the corpses.

13
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,916
I will go over now.

14
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:31,541
Bhairavi! If you want your daughter
to be alive, let go of me now!

15
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,333
Do you want her to die?

16
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,208
Throw your gun away or I will shoot her.

17
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,875
Don't make it worse, just leave her!

18
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,250
Do you want me to shoot her?
Throw your gun away!

19
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,458
- Mom!
- Yes, dear?

20
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,500
Mom.

21
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,083
Mom you don't want to talk to him forever?

22
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,791
Mr. Siddarth.

23
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,333
Do you want coffee?

24
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,250
I'm asking you! Can you hear me?

25
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,750
We used to be so happy.

26
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,791
But now?

27
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,875
Don't think about this nonsense.

28
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,833
- Good morning madam.
- Good morning Ravin.

29
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,333
<i>I'm all right madam.</i>

30
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,916
<i>Anytime I'm ready to join.
My family just won't allow it.</i>

31
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,291
Oh no! Not to that extent madam.

32
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,916
Only to the extent
of having an appetite to eat.

33
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,916
How can you do it then?

34
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,208
- Strengthen your body first, dear.
- Sure, madam.

35
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,625
How's your new assistant, madam?

36
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:06,958
He's good.

37
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,958
I've warned him to take good care of you.

38
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,541
Madam, the victim's name is Preethy.

39
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,833
Another girl is staying here in this unit.

40
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,208
- Her name is Aishwarya.
- That girl is still missing.

41
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,875
- Madam shall I?
- Yeah, go ahead.

42
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,708
Madam, the major injury comes
from the shock of being hit

43
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,000
with a blunt item on the victim's head.

44
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,416
There was tremendous blood loss.

45
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,375
The victim was strangled with a belt

46
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,125
- What about fingerprints?
- Yes, Madam.

47
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,958
At the doorknob,
kitchen appliances, and also on this belt.

48
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:01,333
But, madam, there's no fingerprint
on this candle stand. It's clean.

49
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,875
Even on the sorry note,
there are fingerprints.

50
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,250
We're still trying to find out
who wrote this note.

51
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:20,166
The incident happened last night,
which is Friday between 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.

52
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,875
Evidence 6.

53
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,166
There are also fingerprints
on these items, madam.

54
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,000
But there is no other evidence.

55
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:39,791
- Deepak, did you find Preethy's phone?
- No, it's missing, madam.

56
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,166
<i>I am Aishwarya's father, madam.</i>

57
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,958
I've been trying
to contact her since Friday.

58
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,333
But I couldn't contact her madam.

59
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,916
I've also tried to contact Preethy.

60
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,041
But couldn't reach her too, madam.

61
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,375
That's why I came here to visit them.

62
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,291
When I arrived,
I saw Preethy in this condition.

63
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,041
I've treated her
like my daughter too madam.

64
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,625
When was the last time you called her?

65
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,125
Last Friday madam.

66
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,750
Madam.

67
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:13,000
Aishwarya is a patient person,
it's impossible that she did this.

68
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,208
All right sir, thank you.

69
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,291
Our victim Preethy, 20 years old.

70
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,500
And this is Aishwarya, the missing girl
who is Preethy's housemate.

71
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:34,625
Nineteen years old and her family
is from Kapar and she's studying IT.

72
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,041
No medical issues. No criminal issues.

73
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,958
Madam, the hostel CCTV footage shows that

74
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,916
at 4 p.m. Preethy took the elevator
to the parking lot.

75
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,500
Looking anxious.

76
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,666
Preethy didn't come out after that.

77
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,291
At 6 p.m., Aishwarya, the missing girl

78
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,083
came out of the hostel.

79
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,458
Most probably she took a bus
from the bus stop in front of the hostel.

80
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,291
Because if someone else picked her up,
she would've gone to the hostel lobby.

81
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,750
Or Grab.

82
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,083
- Okay, good but try to find out more.
- Okay, ma'am.

83
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,416
Madam, Preethy has got two ex-boyfriends.

84
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,083
After doing their background check,

85
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,125
they don't have any
serious conflicts with Preethy.

86
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,791
Her current boyfriend is called Viknesh.

87
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,708
Preethy has been in a relationship
with Viknesh for one year.

88
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,291
Preethy has two close friends,

89
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,791
{\an8}who are Aathi and Sharath.

90
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,958
{\an8}Close friends for ten years
since their schooling days.

91
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,208
One more thing madam.

92
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,958
Aathi is Aishwarya's boyfriend madam.

93
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,875
In conclusion,
there are four main suspects

94
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,250
- in this case.
- Yes, madam.

95
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,000
Aathi, Viknesh, and Sharath...

96
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:42,000
their cars did not enter the hostel lobby
on the day of the incident.

97
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:48,416
A status saying that
Viknesh tricked her four months ago.

98
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,333
And then, one day before the murder,

99
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,000
Preethy indirectly scolded Aishwarya
in her Facebook status.

100
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:57,750
But Aishwarya is not active
on her social network or Instagram.

101
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,083
Occasionally she will
be active on Facebook

102
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,500
Most of it is posting selfies
or photos with Preethy.

103
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,958
We couldn't find much information.

104
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,166
I've checked her laptop.

105
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,583
Nothing unusual about
her telephone records too.

106
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,416
Most of the calls were made to
Viknesh, Aishwarya, and Aathi.

107
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,458
And a few other calls.

108
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,666
Yes, Madam.

109
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,000
- Have you checked her iCloud?
- Not yet, Madam.

110
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,750
Try checking it, you might find
something on her WhatsApp backup.

111
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:23,791
We'll check, Madam.

112
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,041
Sri Ram try focusing
on the list of buses that pass by there.

113
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,916
Get the hostel CCTV footage.

114
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,250
Viknesh went to Uncle's house sir.
He will be back tomorrow.

115
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,791
I will let him know to meet with you.

116
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,166
What happened to his phone?

117
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,541
Why can't he be contacted?

118
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,625
I'm not sure sir.
He contacted us a while ago.

119
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,791
When he comes back,
I'll let him know to meet with you.

120
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,208
Sir, this is a murder case.

121
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,750
We cannot easily let him go.

122
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,333
Aren't you his uncle?
Try contacting him again.

123
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,291
We need to speak with him.

124
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,083
Madam. He is not here.

125
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,166
Don't forget to tell Viknesh
to meet us tomorrow.

126
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,625
- Yes, madam.
- Okay.

127
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,250
- I forgot to give you this.
- Give it to me, madam.

128
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,041
- Madam.
- Let me wash it, madam.

129
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,250
- I can wash it, don't worry.
- I will do it.

130
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,041
What are you doing here?

131
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,375
Can help mom in the kitchen?

132
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,625
I found out just this evening.

133
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,833
I couldn't help but feel sad.

134
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,000
I tried to commit suicide,
but my father blocked me.

135
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,291
I told my father what happened.

136
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,416
He was scared that I would be blamed.

137
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
At that time madam came.

138
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,208
That's why my father asked me to hide.

139
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,500
What is the problem
between you and Preethy?

140
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,083
There is no problem between us, madam.

141
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,375
Preethy is quick to anger.

142
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,333
It's just a small argument between us.

143
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,958
All this happened
because of Aishwarya, madam.

144
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,875
I don't know why she likes
to interfere in our issues.

145
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,041
I think she used to like me.
It's not my fault.

146
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,958
Preethy argued with me because of her.

147
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,666
Preethy thinks I'm having
an affair with Aishwarya.

148
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,916
I've explained it to her many times
but she doesn't trust me.

149
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,583
She's angry at me
because Aishwarya bought the red pillow.

150
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,416
She's angry with me
even for things like this.

151
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,416
- Red bolster?
- Yes, madam.

152
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,000
I like the color red.

153
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,708
All the things in Preethy's room,

154
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,333
<i>the pillow, bedsheets are red
because of me.</i>

155
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,125
Suddenly one day,

156
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,291
Aishwarya too owns things of that color.

157
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,625
It's not my fault.

158
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,250
Preethy asked to break up with me.

159
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,250
Because she was angry,

160
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,000
I gave her space to cool down.

161
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,541
That's why I've not been talking
to her for a while.

162
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,625
How's Aishwarya's attitude?

163
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,250
She's a good girl.

164
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,666
The type who doesn't talk much.

165
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,000
She likes to "like" my photos on Facebook.

166
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,375
And comment on my photos.

167
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,666
I've never taken advantage of her.

168
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,958
From there, Preethy started to suspect me.

169
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,208
- You've never talked to her about it?
- I did, madam.

170
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,125
Just casual talk, nothing much.

171
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,750
After this problem,

172
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,125
I stopped talking to her.

173
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,750
Where were you on Friday evening
during the incident?

174
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:05,750
I was at home, madam.

175
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,125
Who else, madam? It must be Aishwarya!

176
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,958
You! Maybe you did it.

177
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,791
Preethy was like my life, madam.

178
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,250
There's no way I would murder her, madam.

179
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,416
Aishwarya is the cause of all this.

180
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,708
If I could find her,
I am not sure what I would do!

181
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,958
She has destroyed my life, madam.

182
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,750
Please help me find her, madam.

183
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:33,416
Only then will the spirit
of Preethy be at peace.

184
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,541
Please find her, madam.

185
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,125
He's very important for this case.
Do you know him?

186
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,208
I do not know him, madam.

187
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,166
Don't come home!
There's a chaotic meeting going on here.

188
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,708
Who is there?

189
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,708
Aunt, Uncle, and Dad.

190
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,833
They have nothing else to do, my dear.

191
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,916
- Is there anyone who will support me?
- Uncle...

192
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,333
Pity him. He's the only one
who supports you, Mom.

193
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:07,958
I've got to go now, dear.

194
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,166
Let me come save him.

195
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,500
<i>We've received the fingerprint report.</i>

196
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,250
<i>I've sent it to your email,
please check it.</i>

197
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,041
<i>- Do you want me to brief, Madam?</i>
- Yes, tell me sir.

198
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,166
<i>Evidence 1 and 5.</i>

199
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,625
<i>The fingerprints on the sorry note
belongs to Aishwarya.</i>

200
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,208
<i>The fingerprints in the room
and in the kitchen belong to Preethy.</i>

201
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,291
<i>That is usual.</i>

202
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,583
<i>But the fingerprint on the belt used to
strangle the victim belongs to Aishwarya.</i>

203
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,125
<i>And we also found one more fingerprint.</i>

204
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,791
<i>We're still processing it.</i>

205
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,916
<i>The fingerprint we found
on the doorknob belongs to Aishwarya.</i>

206
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,125
When can I get that information?

207
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,250
<i>We are working on it the whole night.
Might send it any time, Madam.</i>

208
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,833
Janani, please go upstairs, dear.

209
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,875
Who would like to start first?

210
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,625
What else do you want to talk about?

211
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,333
We've told you of our decision.

212
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,583
You're the one
who has yet to make the decision.

213
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,000
I've told you my answer, right?

214
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,791
My answer isn't what you want!
That's the problem now.

215
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,708
That you don't want to resign.

216
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,750
Siddarth knew about this
before going out with me.

217
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,333
We've been married for 12 years.

218
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,541
What's his problem now?

219
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,416
My daughter almost got killed.

220
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,000
Because of you!

221
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,291
Because of your job!

222
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,000
Do you want me to treat this
as something normal?

223
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,166
You're behaving like this
because it happens to Janani.

224
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,083
How many times has my sister
faced a situation like this?

225
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,291
When she talked about those situations

226
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,833
you were entertained
like watching an action movie.

227
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,875
- Why are you angry now?
- I just don't know!

228
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,625
I've never felt
this insecure feeling before.

229
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,541
- If this happened to me! Wait!
- When that incident happened to me...

230
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:27,375
Maybe I would not have done the same
if I was in that situation.

231
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,958
But then it's... Janani!

232
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,083
What if something had happened to her?

233
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,125
I was there during the situation Siddarth!

234
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,416
She was with me at that time.

235
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
But you weren't there!

236
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,125
I was the one who experienced that pain!

237
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,208
I admit that it was hard to forget.

238
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,375
But it had happened!

239
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,541
Because of that, you want me to resign?

240
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,958
- Do you understand?
- This is my life!

241
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,250
If you wish to serve the community.
Please go ahead!

242
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,125
You knew all these, try to understand me.

243
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,166
You want me to live in fear?

244
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,458
It's not like that!

245
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,333
- You think too much!
- How do you want me to think?

246
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,416
Don't shout, Siddarth. Calm down.

247
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,833
Can you hear what she says?

248
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,208
She's not willing to compromise at all.

249
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,208
I want you to resign! Or else...

250
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,750
Sign our divorce letter.

251
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,708
Give me custody.

252
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,083
Then live however you like!

253
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,500
All right.

254
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,333
If situations like this happen to me...

255
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,291
I will be shot by the criminal!

256
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,000
I would have died!

257
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,916
Even then you would not resign, right?

258
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,125
You're good at acting!

259
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,416
Do not pressure me! Just tell me!

260
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,916
I'm just a normal girl, madam.

261
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,000
Not much has been happening.

262
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,250
I will be scared even of small things.

263
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:53,000
My problem or maximum stress
is when the lecturer scolds me

264
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,625
for failing to hand
in my assignment on time.

265
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:58,375
I'm just a normal girl, madam.

266
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:00,750
I never imagined...

267
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,791
love and friendship will bring me here.

268
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,875
<i>I have a small world for myself.</i>

269
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:19,791
<i>Father, mother, calves, and Shiva.</i>

270
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,833
<i>Shiva is my life.</i>

271
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,416
<i>We've been together
since my schooling days, madam.</i>

272
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,041
<i>We hope to study in Kuala Lumpur.</i>

273
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,416
<i>We've received the offer.</i>

274
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,750
<i>But in different colleges.</i>

275
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:33,833
<i>I moved to Kuala Lumpur first.</i>

276
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:37,583
<i>I've never been far apart
from Shiva all this while.</i>

277
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:41,416
<i>I've moved to KL with the hope
that Shiva will come over soon.</i>

278
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:47,833
<i>During college,</i>

279
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,750
<i>life became colorful.</i>

280
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:52,958
<i>With our groups of friends.</i>

281
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,666
<i>Preethy, the daughter
of my father's close friend.</i>

282
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,750
<i>That's why I stay with her.</i>

283
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,125
<i>She's like my best friend.</i>

284
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,708
<i>Aathi, Preethy's long-time friend.</i>

285
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,375
<i>Sharath too.</i>

286
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,333
<i>Our lives were perfect.</i>

287
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,416
Classes will start next week
but I've not found a room to rent yet.

288
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,875
I felt stressed.

289
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:18,833
Come quick.

290
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:21,041
- I miss you.
- Me too.

291
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:26,083
<i>Preethy is quick-tempered.</i>

292
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,583
<i>She does things without thinking.</i>

293
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:32,375
It's one of the reasons this all happened.

294
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,208
It's her short-tempered personality.

295
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:39,708
- What are you doing here?
- Surprise!

296
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:42,000
- So sweet!
- You've changed so much!

297
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,916
Are you the girl that I knew in Kapar?

298
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:52,791
<i>After meeting Shiva,
my longing for him disappeared.</i>

299
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,791
My only problem is the issue of food

300
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,833
I tried to overcome it with bread.

301
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:00,125
So I do not have any problems.

302
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,875
Sis Varshini will cook every day.

303
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:03,916
All I need is to buy
the kitchen appliances.

304
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:05,458
Who is that?

305
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:07,333
My housemate and also my senior.

306
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:08,875
She is a good cook.

307
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,458
She is sweet and friendly.

308
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:12,875
I will introduce you later.

309
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:18,750
<i>In a short moment,
I started to miss Shiva.</i>

310
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:21,791
<i>Shiva rarely communicates with me.</i>

311
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,375
You rarely talk to me.

312
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:28,416
It's not that my dear,
the stress from assignments.

313
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,833
Yes, I will come.

314
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:36,750
I will call you later, if I don't go
over now, she will finish my food.

315
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,250
- Goodbye!
- Let's talk again later...

316
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:45,958
<i>Something is not right.</i>

317
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,333
<i>My thoughts are not calm.</i>

318
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:51,791
<i>I've decided to talk to Shiva about this.</i>

319
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,833
There's nothing between us, Aisyu!
Try to understand me.

320
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,208
<i>What do you want me to understand</i>

321
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,041
<i>That photo doesn't look proper
Shiva, I feel scared.</i>

322
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,000
Why are you scared of things like this?

323
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,916
If that's the case,
stop being friends with her.

324
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:04,958
Say you won't be friends with her anymore.

325
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,750
How can I do that?
I'm renting the same house as her.

326
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:10,041
I don't care, you must ignore her for me.

327
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,375
This is not practical, Aisyu.

328
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:13,708
She's like a good friend to me.

329
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:15,875
It's not easy to rent a room here, Aisyu!

330
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:18,875
There's nothing between us!
Don't you believe me?

331
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:23,083
Because you call her a sister,
that's why I didn't care at first.

332
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:29,375
Don't talk badly about her! Understand?

333
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:31,666
It's not that I want to talk badly
about her, but it's the truth.

334
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,750
She likes to wear indecent clothes.
Then she touches you here and there.

335
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,166
I can't just keep quiet about it.

336
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,666
She's not like what you said!

337
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:42,291
She's not all that good.

338
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:44,041
You're exaggerating!

339
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:47,833
You don't know how good she is,
she took good care of me.

340
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,791
She's very important to me. Understand?

341
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,375
<i>So now it has come to this?</i>

342
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:53,125
If that's it, you should just go with her!

343
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:56,083
I am only saying
that she too is important to me.

344
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:58,125
That means I need both of you in my life!

345
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:01,208
What? You want both of us?
Aren't you ashamed to speak like this?

346
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:03,000
You're so difficult
to understand! Just hang up!

347
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,666
Sure! Before hanging up,
tell me who you choose. Me or her?

348
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,625
Say it, Shiva.

349
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:09,541
Me or her?

350
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:12,083
Say it, Shiva! Me or her?

351
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,458
Yes! She is important to me!

352
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:16,000
I regret loving you!

353
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:21,333
<i>You're always giving me trouble!</i>

354
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:24,875
What do you mean?

355
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:27,583
- You used to say she's like your sister.
- Yes! So what?

356
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:46,708
I'm sorry, my dear.

357
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,791
I've talked harshly to you.

358
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,916
You might still be angry at me.
I will contact you again later.

359
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:00,041
<i>I love her.</i>

360
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,666
<i>You just go away, okay?</i>

361
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:07,375
It's a culture shock, Shiva.
I know you don't love her.

362
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:09,708
Our love is true.

363
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,666
I cannot live without you.

364
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,041
You feel the same about me too.

365
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,916
I will die without you, Shiva.

366
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:20,708
Please, Shiva. Come back to me.

367
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,708
<i>Go ahead and die!</i>

368
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:30,333
Didn't you say you would die without him?

369
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:32,125
<i>He won't come back to you,
so you can go die!</i>

370
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,916
I hope you weren't joking!

371
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,916
Didn't he say he doesn't love you anymore?

372
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,333
Why are you torturing us?

373
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:39,583
<i>Stop disturbing us!</i>

374
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:41,833
You've seen it? Is it enough?

375
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:43,250
<i>Shiva and I love each other.</i>

376
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,125
He confessed that he loves me.

377
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:46,333
He chose me!

378
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:48,458
Yes! Both of us are
in love with each other.

379
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:50,125
You are not suitable for me, Aisyu.

380
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,875
Don't try to persuade me like a dog!
I'm so annoyed with you!

381
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,166
What an embarrassing thing!

382
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:32,916
Could you check?

383
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,750
Who are you? Who are you looking for?

384
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:44,916
- Hello! I'm asking you!
- Who is there, dear?

385
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,250
Hello! I'm asking you!
Why are you staring into space?

386
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:48,166
Who are you looking for?

387
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,000
What do you want?

388
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:56,541
Help?

389
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:58,291
Don't you feel ashamed?
You're a man, right?

390
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,875
Come here!

391
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,708
You want to play chase? Go to hell!

392
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,125
Even a face like yours
could have an affair?

393
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,083
Sit here!

394
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,166
You will be taught a lesson.

395
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,166
Look here!

396
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:24,625
That girl almost died because of you.

397
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:25,916
That is an innocent girl.

398
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:27,833
Look at her face!

399
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:29,791
Damn woman!

400
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:32,958
You should not cheat in love, bro!

401
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:34,000
I hope you understand!

402
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:35,416
Take care of yourself!

403
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:37,333
Aisyu!

404
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:39,875
Brother Sharath has something
for you, let's go look!

405
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:42,833
What is it, bro?

406
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:50,291
Are you okay with this?

407
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:58,208
If our partner wanted a breakup
for the reason that we're not compatible.

408
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,541
That reason is still acceptable.

409
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:01,833
But if he cheats on us,

410
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:03,875
that's what hurts!

411
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,916
How long have you been with him?

412
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:09,875
Three years.

413
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:15,375
I trusted him too much.

414
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,750
That's why it hurts so much.

415
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:20,375
Aathi.

416
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:22,291
He loved a girl named Veena.

417
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,500
For 4 years.

418
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,291
They too broke up with just a voice note.

419
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,375
Just like you.

420
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:28,458
A new college, new environment,

421
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:29,541
and a new boyfriend

422
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:31,333
caused him to be stressed.

423
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:35,416
He extended the semester and didn't
come out of his room for six months.

424
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,333
Just like you,
he tried to commit suicide too.

425
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,250
Then he met with a psychologist.

426
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:43,208
There's some improvement now.

427
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,250
We will be with you.

428
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:50,708
Can we go out?

429
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:52,458
To somewhere far away.

430
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,791
- Now?
- Yes.

431
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:56,208
It's a good idea.

432
00:32:57,583 --> 00:33:00,041
But I can't go with you.
My father is coming after two years.

433
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:05,250
I can ask Aathi to accompany you.

434
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:37,166
<i>My hardships, my life</i>

435
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,958
<i>My tears flow down</i>

436
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:46,333
<i>Because of your poisonous words</i>

437
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:51,250
<i>My heart is heavy</i>

438
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:55,875
<i>What have I done wrong?
What was missing in my love?</i>

439
00:33:55,958 --> 00:34:00,625
<i>Why am I given this loneliness?</i>

440
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:03,083
<i>To find new love</i>

441
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:10,000
<i>You left me without mercy</i>

442
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:15,083
<i>Why did you leave me?</i>

443
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:20,416
<i>You broke my heart for your sake</i>

444
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:25,125
<i>My hardships, my life</i>

445
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:29,625
<i>My tears flow down</i>

446
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:34,250
<i>Because of your poisonous words</i>

447
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:38,958
<i>My heart is heavy</i>

448
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:04,375
<i>Your acting was exposed</i>

449
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:09,083
<i>It's all a lie</i>

450
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:13,791
<i>My love was forgotten</i>

451
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:17,541
<i>My love</i>

452
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:24,583
<i>Why did you destroy my true love?</i>

453
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,916
<i>My love</i>

454
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,916
<i>Love that was built for so long</i>

455
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,791
<i>Damaged by you</i>

456
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:09,166
<i>My direction was changed</i>

457
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:14,125
<i>Torturing me</i>

458
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:18,708
<i>Without you by my side</i>

459
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:22,625
<i>Scares me</i>

460
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:29,083
<i>My every day becomes a puzzle</i>

461
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,708
<i>My love</i>

462
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:38,958
<i>I was tricked by your words</i>

463
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:41,125
<i>Alas!</i>

464
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:45,833
<i>I just realized</i>

465
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:51,416
<i>My hardships, my life</i>

466
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,875
<i>My tears flow down</i>

467
00:36:55,958 --> 00:37:00,291
<i>Because of your poisonous words</i>

468
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:05,291
<i>My heart is heavy...</i>

469
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:12,750
Why does true love always end like this?

470
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:17,583
Not everyone can have a girl like you.

471
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:21,666
Aisyu!

472
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,375
<i>...You leave me without mercy</i>

473
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:28,833
<i>Why did you leave me?</i>

474
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:34,333
<i>You broke my heart for your sake</i>

475
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:39,125
<i>My hardships, my life</i>

476
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:43,333
<i>My tears flow down</i>

477
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:48,208
<i>Because of your poisonous words</i>

478
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:55,333
<i>My heart is heavy...</i>

479
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,125
Aisyu...

480
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:12,458
Aathi.

481
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,416
Don't make my situation worse.

482
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:20,333
The camera is out of battery,
I'll go get it.

483
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,125
Think about it.

484
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,041
Okay. If you know or hear anything...

485
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:26,750
...please WhatsApp this number.

486
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,083
What's your name?

487
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,208
Kim, madam.

488
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,166
Did you observe anything?

489
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,791
Yes!

490
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,583
When they were in the living room,

491
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:46,250
the girl said "iCloud delete."

492
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,958
And once they came into the room,

493
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:50,000
the girl used the word "shit"
and, again, "iCloud."

494
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:02,750
Madam. We got the statement
from Preethy's ex-boyfriend.

495
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:06,125
We've also spoken to
Preethy and Aisyu's parents.

496
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:10,208
Madam. We've detected
Preethy's iCloud account.

497
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,333
But what's interesting is that

498
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:13,291
last Saturday,

499
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:15,083
which is the day after Preethy's death,

500
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:17,125
someone else formatted Preethy's laptop,

501
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:18,416
and also used her cell phone.

502
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,875
Aishwarya did not sync it
to her cell phone.

503
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,166
We need the password
to open Aisyu's iCloud account.

504
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,291
After they deleted
Preethy's iCloud account,

505
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:42,541
they tried to delete
Aishwarya's iCloud account too.

506
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:44,958
They were not successful.

507
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:57,583
It wasn't Aishwarya who came that night.

508
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:01,583
There's another story behind this case.

509
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:11,958
Where were you on Friday night?

510
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:19,541
We've been friends for ten years.

511
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,833
I don't believe she'd do it, Madam.

512
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:31,458
I feel there's something else going on.

513
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:34,625
Do you suspect anyone?

514
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:36,500
Nobody, madam.

515
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:37,833
Most probably Viknesh.

516
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:40,000
But he's a coward.

517
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:42,458
He's not the type
who is brave enough to commit murder.

518
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:45,250
- Do you have an issue with Viknesh?
- Not like that.

519
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:48,708
I do not like him
because he's a womanizer.

520
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:50,500
Likes to lie.

521
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:54,416
That's why I rarely talk to him.

522
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:57,750
He lied to Preethy.

523
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:02,083
Preethy might be able to accept it
because of love. But I can't.

524
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:05,291
I heard Viknesh
and Aishwarya had an affair.

525
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:06,625
Do you know anything about this?

526
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:14,666
Recently Preethy has become stubborn.

527
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:18,416
But Aisyu won't say anything.

528
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:20,958
I'm sure Aisyu isn't such a girl, Madam.

529
00:45:21,041 --> 00:45:24,625
Last Thursday, Preethy and Aishwarya
were arguing in the college canteen.

530
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:32,541
One day Preethy asked me to go
over to her room to wake her up.

531
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:35,250
Then the next day, they had a big fight.

532
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:39,041
<i>Preethy accused Viknesh
of being in the room with Aisyu.</i>

533
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:44,208
After the incident, Aisyu was upset.

534
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:45,833
<i>I tried to help them.</i>

535
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:48,375
<i>But Aisyu has contacted Preethy
and discussed the issue.</i>

536
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:50,083
<i>I'm not sure what they talked about.</i>

537
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:51,958
<i>But they've reconciled.</i>

538
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:56,750
But...

539
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,375
The next day.

540
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:00,958
Do you know Shiva?

541
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:04,333
Which Shiva?

542
00:46:04,416 --> 00:46:05,708
Aishwarya's ex-boyfriend.

543
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,750
Who is Vijay Andrew in this case?

544
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:10,125
Do you know who is Vijay Andrew?

545
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:11,500
Yes, I know.

546
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:12,666
Who is he?

547
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,583
A graphic design student
from University Lim Kok Wing,

548
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,166
23 years old and from Kuala Lumpur.

549
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,083
- How did you get his information?
- From Facebook.

550
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:20,041
Why are you interested
in knowing about him?

551
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:21,458
Just my curiosity. Because...

552
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:25,083
Madam asked this question
about Vijay Andrew to all suspects. So...

553
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:28,500
If you feel that way, then surely the
killer too will want to know about him.

554
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:37,250
This is like bait to catch the killer.

555
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:41,833
Vijay Andrew is no one.
I just created this character.

556
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:44,041
All the information you got from Facebook

557
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:45,458
was created by our people.

558
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:49,166
The profile photo is
that of our officer, Mr. Saresh.

559
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:52,000
We've put the bait.

560
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:53,291
Let's see who will get caught.

561
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:05,625
Madam, this is Preethy's car.
It entered the hostel at 4 p.m.

562
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,291
She saw something there.

563
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,083
- Yes, Sri Ram.
- Madam, I got it!

564
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:28,833
- What have you got?
- As I said,

565
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:30,625
Aishwarya boarded the bus that day.

566
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:31,958
She got down at the street mall bus stop.

567
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:35,083
<i>There's CCTV footage.
I've emailed it, please check, madam.</i>

568
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:39,375
- Go on.
- After that, she got into a car madam.

569
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,083
- We've got the car number plate too.
- Good. Try to trace it quickly.

570
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:46,208
Sri Ram. I need CCTV footage
of Viknesh's house.

571
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:48,000
Just for that particular day. Get it.

572
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:49,583
Okay, I will get it now ma'am.

573
00:48:49,666 --> 00:48:51,750
They said that he was at home
on the day of the incident.

574
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:52,708
Let's check if it's true.

575
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:54,291
All right, madam.

576
00:48:55,416 --> 00:48:56,875
Madam, I got the footage.

577
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:26,000
What happened?
What's her condition Siddarth?

578
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:27,708
Where was she shot?
It's just a minor injury, right?

579
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:35,166
Is she all right? Is she awake?

580
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:40,416
I do not know too, Siddarth!
How is she? I want to see her, please.

581
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:43,750
What is her sin?

582
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,500
This is all your fault!

583
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:46,833
You didn't want to listen to me!

584
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:48,750
Before she was kidnapped!
Now they've shot her!

585
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,833
What else do you want?
Do you want her to die?

586
00:50:50,916 --> 00:50:52,625
I will die too if anything happens to her.

587
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:54,250
- Is that what you want?
- No.

588
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,000
Why are you still alive?

589
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:59,875
Wouldn't it be good if someone shot you!
Let you die!

590
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:02,875
Don't say such things Siddarth.

591
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,125
- Please.
- Listen.

592
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:07,208
Leave us.

593
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:09,000
- I will take care of my daughter.
- Siddarth.

594
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:11,041
- This is too much, Bhairavi.
- I want to see her.

595
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,583
You better go!

596
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,458
- Please let me see her again.
- Get away from here!

597
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:19,083
Don't try to come near my daughter!

598
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:21,750
Don't look for us anymore, Bhairavi!

599
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,625
- Hello?
<i>- Madam, we've got new information.</i>

600
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:35,208
<i>Someone is following Vijay Andrew.</i>

601
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:37,625
<i>Grey Myvi number plate WC4669F.</i>

602
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:28,541
Madam! Vijay Andrew is on the line.

603
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:35,208
Madam! In 12 kilometers, there's a
restaurant on the left side of the road.

604
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:37,583
<i>I'll go over first madam.</i>

605
00:52:57,958 --> 00:52:59,625
<i>There is a parking lot next to them.</i>

606
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,625
Saresh.

607
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:07,875
What are you trying to do?

608
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:10,583
Trying to scare us?

609
00:55:10,666 --> 00:55:12,375
- I don't understand madam.
- Where is she?

610
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:14,041
- I don't understand what you are saying.
- Where is she now?

611
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:16,500
- Who madam?
- Where is Aishwarya?

612
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:19,083
Tell me where is she now. You don't know?

613
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:20,708
Talk!

614
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:24,208
I will find her.

615
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:26,583
I will break the hands
that shot my daughter!

616
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:29,916
Ravin! In my situation,
I'm not sure what I'll do.

617
00:55:30,625 --> 00:55:32,208
- You handle him.
- Okay, madam.

618
00:55:58,083 --> 00:56:00,000
My daughter!

619
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:12,666
My daughter!

620
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:33,041
Not long after,

621
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:35,541
I accepted Aathi's love.

622
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:38,458
We started dating.

623
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:42,083
<i>Our lives were happy.</i>

624
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,750
<i>A new chapter of our lives began.</i>

625
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:50,333
But all these didn't last.

626
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:54,166
Because of Viknesh.

627
00:57:57,375 --> 00:58:00,000
<i>I need Viknesh's help with my assignment.</i>

628
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:03,333
<i>Then we started talking.</i>

629
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:08,416
<i>Do you have a problem
with the CSS code or JavaScript, Aisyu?</i>

630
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,750
My JavaScript is okay.

631
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:12,041
It's just that it's not aligned.

632
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:14,458
<i>If it's not aligned, then it must be
a problem with the CSS code.</i>

633
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:15,750
<i>- What you need to do is...</i>
- And then...

634
00:58:15,833 --> 00:58:16,791
- Hi!
- Hi.

635
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:19,458
<i>- Who is it, Aisyu?</i>
- Preethy is here, Viknesh.

636
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:22,208
<i>I just thought of calling you.</i>

637
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:30,125
Okay, which do you think is more suitable?

638
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,833
My favorite hero acted well,
you just didn't like it.

639
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:35,833
There's no difference between
the hero's acting and a comedy.

640
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:37,500
You should try to act, then you'll know.

641
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:39,666
Aisyu did warn us earlier on
that the film would be boring.

642
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,458
- You're always talk like this.
- You didn't listen to me.

643
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:43,083
You only find me when there's a problem.

644
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:46,250
I used the code that you gave me.
How did you pass?

645
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:48,666
Funny girl. You make mistakes
even with "copy paste."

646
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:49,958
Now you're blaming me.

647
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:51,625
Hi.

648
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:53,083
Viknesh, you didn't tell me
that you were coming.

649
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:55,416
I asked him to come.
I need to submit my assignment

650
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,458
to the lecturer in an hour.
So I asked him to come.

651
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:59,541
Usually, you do assignments
in the study room, right?

652
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:01,208
Why do it in the bedroom today?

653
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,666
Viknesh said there was no line
in that room.

654
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:04,958
So we used this room.

655
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,208
Please wait. I'll get you a coffee, okay?

656
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:15,041
Why is the red bolster here?

657
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:20,041
I don't know.

658
00:59:28,916 --> 00:59:31,000
Why? I didn't do anything.

659
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:33,166
As if you did nothing.

660
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,083
- What are you talking about?
- I've not spoken yet, Viknesh.

661
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:40,500
Save your apologies!
Just tell me you'll stop this.

662
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:44,166
Why do you always misunderstand?

663
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:47,208
She's a good friend of ours.
Don't you believe her?

664
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:50,041
Of course I trust her. I don't trust you.

665
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:52,041
This isn't the first time for you.

666
00:59:52,125 --> 00:59:53,666
Why are you bringing up the past, baby?

667
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:54,958
I've changed my dear.

668
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:01,458
Just do as I say.

669
01:00:01,541 --> 01:00:05,541
Just give an excuse
so that she will not find you again!

670
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,041
Hello! What are you doing?

671
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:19,333
I'm trying to correct this lamp
so that madam can do the assignment.

672
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:22,041
Excuse me. Can you not disturb me?

673
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:25,375
Hey!

674
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:28,791
- Hello.
<i>- Hi, Aisyu.</i>

675
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:32,125
- Thanks.
<i>- Sorry, I'll be out of town this week.</i>

676
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:33,708
<i>I cannot help you.</i>

677
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:37,166
You've helped me a lot.

678
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:39,750
<i>It's okay, you're welcome.</i>

679
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,750
<i>- All the best, okay?</i>
- Thank you.

680
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:03,208
<i>- Hi!</i>
- Hi, babe!

681
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:05,458
I'm below your condo,
shall we go for a drink?

682
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:06,666
I'm at college. I can't come.

683
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,500
I found Viknesh's car here.

684
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,666
That's why I thought
you were at the hostel.

685
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:14,666
- What is it?
- Nothing. Where's Aisyu?

686
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,750
She didn't answer my phone,
I think she's still sleeping.

687
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:19,166
Better go to the room and wake her up.

688
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,125
Yes, I better. Okay, bye.

689
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:22,125
Bye.

690
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:33,750
- Yes, babe?
- <i>Where are you?</i>

691
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,000
- I'm waiting for you down here.
<i>- Okay.</i>

692
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:37,291
<i>I fell asleep, I'll come now.</i>

693
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:38,833
Okay. Bye.

694
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:45,666
Why is your car at my hostel
when I'm not there?

695
01:01:48,916 --> 01:01:50,958
Answer my question first!
Why is your car there?

696
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:54,833
Why? Is she prettier than me?

697
01:01:54,916 --> 01:01:56,250
For God's sake!

698
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:59,208
- Trust me, I did not go there!
- Then how did your car end up there?

699
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:01,291
Are you sure they saw my car there?

700
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:03,958
There are many cars
of the same color and brand as mine!

701
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:07,708
Do they know my car number plate?

702
01:02:14,875 --> 01:02:15,791
Hello, Aathi.

703
01:02:16,375 --> 01:02:18,291
Did you see Viknesh's
car number plate just now?

704
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:20,208
<i>I did not notice the car number plate.</i>

705
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:21,833
- All right.
- Okay, bye.

706
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:26,833
Don't keep blaming me!

707
01:02:26,916 --> 01:02:29,291
I did not do anything.
Why are you torturing me?

708
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:32,916
Calm down.

709
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,416
The only way to resolve this matter...

710
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:36,416
...is for you to trust me.

711
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,416
Trust me completely.

712
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,083
Don't be suspicious of me.

713
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:40,458
If you're still suspicious of me.

714
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:41,916
This is what happens!

715
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:43,333
Do you understand?

716
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:49,583
I've changed, Preethy.

717
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:51,500
I hope you understand.

718
01:02:51,583 --> 01:02:53,291
Please trust me.

719
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:03,375
Listen. Aathi is very sensitive.

720
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:05,208
This will be a big problem
if he finds out.

721
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:07,000
Why are you torturing me like this?

722
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:10,958
It's not important for me
to understand your situation.

723
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:19,500
What did he say?

724
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:20,833
Who?

725
01:03:20,916 --> 01:03:22,666
I'm talking to you.

726
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:25,000
Are you asking me? Who?

727
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:26,208
Your lover Viknesh!

728
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:29,541
Answer me.

729
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:31,875
I don't understand, Preethy.
What do you mean?

730
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:33,041
Don't understand?

731
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:34,583
You will not understand.

732
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:36,208
Preethy, stop that!
Everyone is looking at us.

733
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:38,208
- What is your problem?
- Can both of you not argue here?

734
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:40,916
What did you say on the phone?
You don't think I don't know?

735
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:41,958
You think I'm stupid?

736
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:43,666
Please understand, Preethy,
it's not Viknesh!

737
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,166
Then who was it?

738
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,958
Tell me who was it.

739
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:49,083
I was talking to my father.

740
01:03:49,166 --> 01:03:50,041
Talking to your father?

741
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:51,875
- Don't lie!
- Control yourself, Preethy!

742
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:54,375
I treated you as my friend!

743
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:56,583
I don't care
if you're having an affair with him.

744
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,458
- It's not that, Preethy.
- To me, both of you are dead!

745
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:01,041
You lied to me!

746
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:02,625
- Please try to understand!
- You betrayed me!

747
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,125
You don't trust me?

748
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:05,750
Get lost!

749
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:24,750
<i>I'm not sure
if Preethy's anger is fair or not.</i>

750
01:04:25,916 --> 01:04:29,583
<i>But I tried to make her
understand the real situation.</i>

751
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,833
<i>Shiva tried to persuade me
to get back with him.</i>

752
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:35,416
<i>He tortured me.</i>

753
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:37,583
<i>If Aathi finds out about this.</i>

754
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,541
<i>It will be a big problem.</i>

755
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,416
<i>I didn't tell anyone.</i>

756
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,958
Forgive me, Aisyu.

757
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:45,041
Aisyu!

758
01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:46,750
Wait, Aisyu!

759
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:50,416
There's nothing I want
to talk about with you.

760
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,916
Apologizing is not enough, Shiva.

761
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,708
That's not it, Aisyu!

762
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:55,458
There's nothing between us, Shiva.

763
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:56,916
I almost died because of you.

764
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,916
Even in that condition,
you didn't come to see me!

765
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Please Aisyu. I made a mistake.

766
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:02,416
Please give me another chance, Aisyu.

767
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,458
You said,

768
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:05,416
she takes care of you better than I do.

769
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,916
In the same way, Aathi takes care
of me better than you do.

770
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,458
- Please, Aisyu!
- That's it, Shiva!

771
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:11,125
There's nothing left between us.

772
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:17,208
<i>I've sent all the short messages
received from Shiva to Preethy.</i>

773
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:18,375
<i>So that Preethy will
understand my situation.</i>

774
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:21,500
<i>Finally, Preethy understood my situation</i>

775
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:23,083
<i>and apologized to me.</i>

776
01:05:23,583 --> 01:05:25,833
{\an8}I assumed that
all my problems were resolved.

777
01:05:27,083 --> 01:05:27,958
{\an8}But...

778
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:30,958
{\an8}on the next day, which was Friday

779
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:33,000
was the day Preethy died.

780
01:05:34,416 --> 01:05:36,916
The day our lives were changed.

781
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:15,000
Mom.

782
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:17,083
Mom, you should not leave the job.

783
01:06:17,958 --> 01:06:20,458
Perhaps I have not
thought about it before.

784
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:22,666
But now I must make a decision.

785
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,750
It's not a big deal, Mom.

786
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:26,750
They were only trying to scare you.

787
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:28,708
Mom, you're not the type
who is afraid of all this.

788
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:33,250
Those who did this
will not be out there much longer.

789
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:34,750
I'll catch them as soon as possible.

790
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:38,791
Mom, don't give up.

791
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:42,458
My mom will never ever go down.
Promise me.

792
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,416
Pinky promise my dear!

793
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:51,291
You've grown up.

794
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:53,708
- I'm a big girl now.
- Really?

795
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,291
Aisyu and I have been in love
since our schooling days.

796
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:02,458
<i>Then I came to the city.</i>

797
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:05,166
<i>I broke up with Aisyu
because of another girl.</i>

798
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:07,333
I've hurt Aisyu's heart.

799
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:11,583
Not long after that, I realized my
mistake.

800
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:13,875
I decided to break up with that girl.

801
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:15,041
Tried to get back to Aisyu.

802
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:16,875
She tried to avoid me.

803
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:19,125
But I did not give up.

804
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:21,875
I did my best to win her heart back.

805
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:22,875
I went to her college.

806
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:25,916
Her hostel. Tried to persuade her
through short messages.

807
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,416
But she did not accept me.

808
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,833
Finally, she agreed to meet with me.

809
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,125
I waited for her at a restaurant.

810
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:37,250
With the desire to persuade
her until she agrees.

811
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:39,541
But she did not show up, sir.

812
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:40,541
Which restaurant?

813
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,125
At Puchong.

814
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:43,916
I waited almost three hours for her.

815
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,916
She did not show up, sir.

816
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,708
Then I went back.

817
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:49,708
Why did you follow Vijay Andrew?

818
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:53,333
I tried to send her short messages,
but they were not sent.

819
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:55,000
Her phone was unreachable.

820
01:07:55,083 --> 01:07:57,458
I thought she blocked my phone number.

821
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:00,000
I went to her college
hoping to meet with her.

822
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:02,750
That's when I received this news.

823
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:05,416
I didn't know what to do at that time.

824
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,500
Her classmate told me about it.

825
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:11,208
That person is looking for
someone named Vijay Andrew.

826
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:15,500
I thought he kidnapped Aisyu.
That's why I followed him.

827
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:16,875
That's all sir.

828
01:08:19,083 --> 01:08:21,375
Ma'am, the investigation results
from his call history

829
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:24,125
showed that he contacted
Aisyu a few weeks back.

830
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:27,500
There are short messages of him
persuading Aisyu to accept him.

831
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:30,291
It's true that he waited
at the restaurant.

832
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:33,000
We've checked the CCTV
footage at the restaurant.

833
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:35,458
He waited there from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.

834
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:38,416
Aishwarya wanted
to meet with him on that day.

835
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,250
She took the bus
from the hostel to Street Mall.

836
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:42,666
At Street Mall, she took
Grab to the restaurant.

837
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,625
She sent short messages
until she reached the restaurant.

838
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:48,666
But we're not sure
what happened to her after that.

839
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,291
Investigation results of the car number
plate proved it was a rented Grab car.

840
01:08:51,375 --> 01:08:54,500
According to the driver's statement,
he dropped Aisyu at the restaurant.

841
01:09:19,166 --> 01:09:21,583
Preethy has been in a relationship
with Viknesh for one year.

842
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:23,291
Four months ago,
Preethy updated her Facebook status

843
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:25,541
<i>that Viknesh tricked her.</i>

844
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:27,000
I feel there's something else going on.

845
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:29,958
Who else, madam? It must be Aishwarya!

846
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:34,541
I found Viknesh's car here.

847
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:35,875
That's why I thought
you were at the hostel.

848
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:37,625
<i>Aathi, Viknesh, and Sharath...</i>

849
01:09:37,708 --> 01:09:41,291
their cars did not enter the hostel lobby
on the day of the incident.

850
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:43,458
It wasn't Aishwarya who came that night.

851
01:09:43,541 --> 01:09:45,041
He's a womanizer.

852
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:46,458
Likes to lie.

853
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,708
She saw something there.

854
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:50,166
Where were you on Saturday night?

855
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,500
I was at home, madam.

856
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,166
Sri Ram.

857
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:58,958
Where's the guard house CCTV footage
from Viknesh's housing area?

858
01:09:59,041 --> 01:10:02,541
Yes ma'am. His car did not come out of
housing area on the day of the incident.

859
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,583
Check the red-colored Proton Saga.

860
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:13,125
The number plate starts with WQN.

861
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:29,833
It came out from the housing area.

862
01:10:29,916 --> 01:10:31,416
Open the hostel CCTV footage.

863
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:39,958
{\an8}- Stop.
- Ma'am, 3 p.m.

864
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,708
This car entered the hostel.

865
01:10:41,791 --> 01:10:43,000
Perfect!

866
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:44,083
Got caught.

867
01:10:55,208 --> 01:10:57,458
I want a list
of the Indian girls in this hostel.

868
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:05,875
Madam.

869
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:08,291
What's this name list for?
I still do not understand.

870
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:10,500
There's no affair
between Aishwarya and Viknesh.

871
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:12,416
Aishwarya was indeed talking to Shiva.

872
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,250
What was Viknesh doing at the hostel?

873
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:16,458
Preethy's doubts about
Viknesh were correct.

874
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:18,416
But Preethy got the wrong person.

875
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,750
Preethy found Viknesh's car
in the parking lot.

876
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:23,541
With anger, Preethy left the place.

877
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:25,833
Viknesh came to meet with someone else.

878
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,333
Let's get him here to find out. Come.

879
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:32,416
- Yes, Deepak.
<i>- I spoke to Viknesh, Madam.</i>

880
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,708
<i>Said he is busy right now.</i>

881
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,583
There's no time for that.
You go and catch him.

882
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:58,041
- Who are you looking for?
- We're the police.

883
01:11:58,125 --> 01:11:59,000
How can I help you, sir?

884
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:01,166
We're here for investigation.
Can we come in?

885
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,250
I just heard some Indian ankle sounds,

886
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:04,500
maybe from the girl's feet.

887
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:11,000
I've not spoken to her before.
But have met her before.

888
01:12:11,083 --> 01:12:13,875
Recently, did you hear anything
unusual from her unit?

889
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:15,166
No, sir. Nothing like that.

890
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,708
Have you talked with Aishwarya before?

891
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:17,708
No, sir.

892
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,916
I rarely mingle with the Indians here.

893
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,250
Only friends with my classmates.

894
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:26,375
Yes, but sorry,
I've not cleaned up my room.

895
01:12:30,916 --> 01:12:32,958
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No, madam.

896
01:12:33,041 --> 01:12:34,750
I don't believe in love.

897
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,875
I like the color red.

898
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:38,500
<i>All the things in Preethy's room</i>

899
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:40,916
<i>the pillow, bedsheets are red
because of me.</i>

900
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:50,791
- How do you know Viknesh?
- I do not know him at all.

901
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:52,833
I do not know her, sir.

902
01:12:52,916 --> 01:12:54,625
- Have you met him before?
- No.

903
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:56,208
Didn't I say that I do not know her?

904
01:12:56,291 --> 01:12:57,833
- Never talked to him before?
- No!

905
01:12:57,916 --> 01:12:59,333
If you don't believe me,
you can check my phone.

906
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:02,208
You're not afraid?

907
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:06,416
Are you confident
that everything will be solved?

908
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,875
I almost got you.

909
01:13:09,791 --> 01:13:11,750
I will surely get the evidence.

910
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:15,333
You will be caught then.

911
01:13:17,416 --> 01:13:19,291
On the way, my dear,
papa is buying food for you.

912
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:23,833
Buy me Kitkat and Choki-choki.

913
01:13:23,916 --> 01:13:25,791
- Buy two.
- All right, dear.

914
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:27,541
- Is that all?
- That's enough, papa.

915
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:28,958
All right dear, see you later.

916
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:31,000
Okay. Thank you!

917
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:33,708
They attacked me from the back.

918
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:35,083
Go to hell!

919
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:39,875
I'm embarrassed to admit
that I'm a police, Ravin!

920
01:14:39,958 --> 01:14:41,458
I still could not detect who they are!

921
01:14:41,958 --> 01:14:43,000
I'm so ashamed!

922
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,791
I'm not a good mother...

923
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:47,416
or an obedient wife to my husband.

924
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,833
I'm also not worthy to be in the police!

925
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:53,250
I don't deserve to live, Ravin.

926
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:58,166
I've never been so sad, Ravin.

927
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:04,250
All these happened
because I still can't find them!

928
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:07,500
If my guess was correct,

929
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:10,083
their next target is you, Madam.

930
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:11,458
Let them come.

931
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:14,750
Let's see who will win.

932
01:15:15,541 --> 01:15:17,083
This must end quickly.

933
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:22,166
- Let's end it!
- Sure, madam.

934
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:25,000
We will surely end it.

935
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:37,375
{\an8}Preethy and I went to college.

936
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:45,791
Preethy.

937
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:47,708
Can we go?

938
01:15:47,791 --> 01:15:48,833
What's all this?

939
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:51,375
- Nothing.
- Okay, let's go.

940
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,250
Are you suspicious of me, Aathi?

941
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:00,541
Preethy said you talked to someone.

942
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:03,291
If it's not Viknesh, then who was it?

943
01:16:03,375 --> 01:16:04,458
Nobody.

944
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:06,583
Why are you lying to me?

945
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:08,208
Preethy did not answer when I asked her.

946
01:16:08,875 --> 01:16:09,916
Something was not right.

947
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,166
I could see it in your eyes.

948
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,708
Don't think of nonsense, Aathi.

949
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:15,833
Recently, I felt this distance
between us. You know that very well.

950
01:16:15,916 --> 01:16:17,791
You can explain to me. I can understand.

951
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:20,166
Can you stop irritating me? Stop it.

952
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,125
Bye.

953
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,666
That's him! Liar!

954
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,875
Do you think I could not
recognize your father's car?

955
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:13,875
Fraud!

956
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:20,916
Bro! Your girlfriend is sleeping
with my boyfriend.

957
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,291
I'm going over to catch them,
you can come if you want!

958
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:40,708
Aisyu open the door!

959
01:17:40,791 --> 01:17:42,000
Aisyu?

960
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:44,375
- Where is he?
- What's wrong with you?

961
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:45,666
Where is he?

962
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,291
- Who?
- Where is he?

963
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:49,000
Where is Viknesh?

964
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:51,625
This again?

965
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:53,541
Does he know that I'm coming?

966
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:57,750
- What's wrong with you, Preethy?
- Very smart!

967
01:17:58,458 --> 01:17:59,666
What's wrong with you, Preethy?

968
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,125
You lied to me!

969
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:03,250
- It's my fault for believing in you!
- What's this?

970
01:18:04,833 --> 01:18:06,250
Don't raise your voice
with me! I will hit you!

971
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:08,666
Hit me if you dare!

972
01:18:15,041 --> 01:18:16,000
Look here!

973
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:17,791
His car is still down there,
so he must be here!

974
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:19,875
- Are you playing with me?
- Think carefully!

975
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:21,583
You can't be sure that he came to find me.

976
01:18:21,666 --> 01:18:24,458
I'm not the only Indian girl
in this hostel!

977
01:18:30,416 --> 01:18:32,166
I'm not a slut.

978
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,500
Today I will meet
with Shiva to end all this.

979
01:18:35,583 --> 01:18:36,916
I'll him that I choose Aathi.

980
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,166
You too are suffering
in your love relationships!

981
01:18:40,666 --> 01:18:43,416
Think carefully and make the decision.

982
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,583
Think properly!

983
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:10,583
<i>If it's not Aisyu who would it be?</i>

984
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:13,875
<i>There are only
five Indian girls in this block.</i>

985
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:17,375
<i>Maybe Gayathiri?</i>

986
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:20,833
<i>Vaishnavi.</i>

987
01:19:22,166 --> 01:19:23,166
<i>No.</i>

988
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:24,125
<i>It must be Dory.</i>

989
01:19:37,791 --> 01:19:41,333
<i>That was the last time I saw Preethy.</i>

990
01:20:04,083 --> 01:20:06,208
<i>When I was about to leave,</i>

991
01:20:06,958 --> 01:20:09,208
<i>I received a voice message from Preethy.</i>

992
01:20:09,291 --> 01:20:11,708
I left without hearing
the contents of the message.

993
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:17,750
Perhaps I could have saved Preethy
if I'd heard the message.

994
01:20:18,791 --> 01:20:20,916
{\an8}<i>Perhaps I shouldn't
have gone to meet Shiva.</i>

995
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,458
All this would not have happened.

996
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:17,833
It's a fresh murder, ma'am.
The victim died from the shot.

997
01:21:37,041 --> 01:21:38,000
Where is Aishwarya?

998
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:42,000
I was going to Puchong
to meet my friend, Madam.

999
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:44,541
After paying for Grab, I got down the car.

1000
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:47,041
Sharath was standing behind me.

1001
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:49,083
He's usually very quiet.

1002
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,666
I fainted.

1003
01:21:55,375 --> 01:21:57,125
I don't know what happened after that.

1004
01:21:58,041 --> 01:22:01,000
When I woke up, I was in a room.

1005
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,750
My legs and hands were tied.

1006
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:04,333
I could not move.

1007
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,750
The next day Sharath came.

1008
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:09,250
He gave me food.

1009
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,583
He allowed me to go to the washroom.

1010
01:22:12,625 --> 01:22:14,166
He spoke to me.

1011
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,125
He hit me.

1012
01:22:18,791 --> 01:22:21,250
He told me that he was crazy about me.

1013
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:23,750
I'm not sure how many days passed, Madam.

1014
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,583
I was given bread and water a few times.

1015
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,500
I begged him to allow me
to go to the washroom.

1016
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:35,916
After I showered...

1017
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,000
He tried to rape me.

1018
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,666
I didn't allow him.

1019
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:44,500
I injured him.

1020
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,583
He hit me

1021
01:22:46,666 --> 01:22:48,666
and broke my hand.

1022
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,333
After that, he didn't come back at all.

1023
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:52,916
Then one day...

1024
01:22:53,958 --> 01:22:55,333
Aathi came over.

1025
01:22:58,291 --> 01:23:01,458
Before we could leave
that place, Sharath arrived.

1026
01:23:01,541 --> 01:23:03,583
Both of them started to argue.

1027
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:07,166
I got hit hard from their argument.

1028
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:08,500
I fainted.

1029
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,791
Do you know that
your friend Preethy is dead?

1030
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:13,041
I was told.

1031
01:23:13,625 --> 01:23:14,958
Madam, do you know who killed her?

1032
01:23:15,041 --> 01:23:17,916
We're working on it.
Do you have any idea what happened?

1033
01:23:21,916 --> 01:23:24,083
She died while you were
still in the house.

1034
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,750
Between 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.

1035
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:27,375
There was an argument between us,

1036
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:29,583
around 4:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.

1037
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:31,458
Then I entered my room.

1038
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:32,875
She left the house

1039
01:23:32,958 --> 01:23:34,875
at the time when you said
she was not at home.

1040
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:37,541
- Do you know where she went?
- No, madam.

1041
01:24:15,541 --> 01:24:16,875
Mohan, I've reconfirmation.

1042
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:18,458
Yes, Ravin.

1043
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:21,500
Mohan, I've received your email
on Aishwarya's iCloud information.

1044
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:23,875
- Please check.
- Okay Ravin, give me some time.

1045
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:25,833
- I will try to get her information.
- Okay.

1046
01:24:27,208 --> 01:24:29,041
Madam, Aishwarya has been
discharged from the hospital.

1047
01:24:29,125 --> 01:24:31,083
She's heading back to her hometown.

1048
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,625
As for your plan,

1049
01:24:32,708 --> 01:24:35,250
Sri Ram and Vijayan have arrived there

1050
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:36,916
to prepare as planned, Madam.

1051
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:40,291
What will we do after this madam?

1052
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:45,291
We will wait and see.

1053
01:24:45,875 --> 01:24:48,125
- Wait for what?
- Aishwarya's next move.

1054
01:24:53,291 --> 01:24:54,375
I want to meet Shiva.

1055
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:57,458
- Ask him to come.
- Why Shiva, madam?

1056
01:24:57,541 --> 01:25:00,166
I need to know
how Aishwarya will take action.

1057
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:39,000
They have arrived madam.

1058
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:41,250
<i>- Is everything okay?</i>
- Yes, madam.

1059
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:43,375
<i>- Observe him.</i>
- Yes, madam.

1060
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:58,500
- What is she doing?
- Wait.

1061
01:26:18,458 --> 01:26:21,166
- She's holding something in her hand.
- Yes.

1062
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:46,916
I've arrived.

1063
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:50,125
They believed what I said. I'm safe now.

1064
01:27:07,666 --> 01:27:09,583
It looks like they're going out.

1065
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:34,208
Answer my call, Aisyu.

1066
01:27:38,375 --> 01:27:40,250
Why didn't she answer?

1067
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,083
Answer my call!

1068
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:49,958
Answer my call!

1069
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:53,833
Dad, I want to go to the bathroom.

1070
01:27:53,916 --> 01:27:55,125
Can we stop at the shop?

1071
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:57,166
Hang on, I'll stop.

1072
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,083
Where is she going?

1073
01:28:09,916 --> 01:28:10,958
Want me to come along?

1074
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:17,291
What is it?

1075
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,750
Aisyu! Did the police ask about me?

1076
01:28:19,833 --> 01:28:22,125
They did not ask about you at all.

1077
01:28:22,208 --> 01:28:24,166
They asked me to go to the police station.

1078
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:25,791
What are you talking about? I'm scared.

1079
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:26,958
Don't be scared.

1080
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:28,500
Maybe it's nothing.

1081
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:30,750
- How do you know?
- I'll handle it!

1082
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:32,000
Where are you now?

1083
01:28:32,083 --> 01:28:33,375
Are you in someplace safe?

1084
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:34,625
At the food court.

1085
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:36,333
I followed my parents to the <i>kuil.</i>

1086
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:38,166
Is there anything else?

1087
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:39,833
I need to go or they will be suspicious.

1088
01:28:39,916 --> 01:28:42,666
I have to go to KL today.

1089
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,958
If I don't go,
they will be suspicious of me.

1090
01:28:45,041 --> 01:28:46,541
<i>I better go meet them.</i>

1091
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:58,541
You go check the shop's CCTV footage.

1092
01:28:58,625 --> 01:28:59,958
I will follow them.

1093
01:29:17,041 --> 01:29:18,833
She has a cell phone, bro.

1094
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:20,416
- She called someone.
<i>- She did?</i>

1095
01:29:41,583 --> 01:29:42,500
Police!

1096
01:29:43,083 --> 01:29:44,041
Take out your cell phone!

1097
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:46,500
- I don't have a cell phone, sir!
- I know you have a cell phone!

1098
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:48,250
Take it out!
Are you going to take it out or not?

1099
01:29:48,333 --> 01:29:49,458
- I don't have a cell phone sir!
- Sir!

1100
01:29:49,541 --> 01:29:50,916
- She doesn't have a cell phone sir!
- What all this dad?

1101
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,875
Listen here, sir.
We watched the CCTV footage.

1102
01:29:52,958 --> 01:29:54,708
- We know she has a cell phone.
- What are you talking about?

1103
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,083
<i>Do you know who it is?</i>

1104
01:30:23,083 --> 01:30:24,083
No.

1105
01:30:26,708 --> 01:30:27,625
I saw her eyes.

1106
01:30:28,666 --> 01:30:30,208
I couldn't get over it.

1107
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:31,333
I've decided.

1108
01:30:37,791 --> 01:30:38,750
What will you do?

1109
01:30:39,666 --> 01:30:40,791
I will open a yoga class.

1110
01:30:43,166 --> 01:30:44,833
I'm the reason you give up right?

1111
01:30:46,875 --> 01:30:48,625
I've experienced
the moment of life and death.

1112
01:30:49,333 --> 01:30:50,958
I could imagine
your feelings at that time.

1113
01:30:51,041 --> 01:30:52,166
That made me think...

1114
01:30:53,208 --> 01:30:54,708
my wife is special.

1115
01:30:54,791 --> 01:30:56,333
I did not appreciate you.

1116
01:30:56,916 --> 01:30:57,791
Sorry!

1117
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:00,208
I realized my mistake.

1118
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:03,625
Don't blame yourself.

1119
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:05,916
It's not your fault, okay?

1120
01:31:07,291 --> 01:31:08,541
Bhairavi, you have to be strong.

1121
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,166
They wanted to attack you from the back.

1122
01:31:12,666 --> 01:31:14,416
Try to think of the reason.

1123
01:31:29,166 --> 01:31:31,458
- Hi Dhivya! How are you?
- I'm fine, sir!

1124
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:33,125
But I could not ask how are you.

1125
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:35,291
- No, I'm fine.
- Get well soon, sir.

1126
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:37,291
- Yes, Sri Ram.
- Ma'am.

1127
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:38,875
She escaped.

1128
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:41,333
I am coming!

1129
01:31:54,458 --> 01:31:55,708
Yes, Mohan!

1130
01:31:55,791 --> 01:31:57,416
Ravin! We've got something interesting.

1131
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,083
<i>A few minutes before Preethy died,</i>

1132
01:31:59,166 --> 01:32:00,875
she sent a voice message to Aishwarya.

1133
01:32:00,958 --> 01:32:02,666
I've sent it to you. Please check.

1134
01:32:05,083 --> 01:32:06,625
<i>Don't act foolishly!</i>

1135
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:08,500
<i>I will not do anything, my dear.</i>

1136
01:32:22,291 --> 01:32:25,458
The first time I saw him was
in the hostel garden with Preethy.

1137
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:28,458
Then we became friends on Facebook.

1138
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:29,708
From there...

1139
01:33:14,416 --> 01:33:16,958
<i>I was with Vaishnavi in the living room.</i>

1140
01:33:17,541 --> 01:33:18,791
<i>I sat on the sofa,</i>

1141
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:21,375
Preethy went in to do a video recording.

1142
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:27,791
She's so disgusting!

1143
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,500
- Who is it?
- It's me, bastard!

1144
01:33:33,583 --> 01:33:34,416
Shit!

1145
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,250
Have you no shame? Don't you know
that he belongs to someone?

1146
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:37,416
So? What's all this?

1147
01:33:38,666 --> 01:33:40,791
Is this live? Stop it!

1148
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:43,125
Womanizer! You have this woman.
Why are you still with me?

1149
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:44,958
Is this all for money?

1150
01:33:45,041 --> 01:33:46,416
- Is she your wife?
- No!

1151
01:33:47,208 --> 01:33:48,083
Don't go overboard.

1152
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:50,833
Who went overboard?

1153
01:33:50,916 --> 01:33:51,875
You son of a b****!

1154
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:54,333
Is this my punishment
for loving and taking care of you?

1155
01:33:54,416 --> 01:33:55,791
Who asked you to love him?

1156
01:33:56,458 --> 01:33:58,083
You're lucky to have me.

1157
01:33:58,166 --> 01:34:00,541
I hit myself with the slippers
because I love you.

1158
01:34:00,625 --> 01:34:02,000
I'll give it. Hit yourself!

1159
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:03,666
I'm not talking to you. I'll slap you!

1160
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:05,750
Who asked you to trust me?
It's your fault, okay?

1161
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:07,458
Hey, look! He hates you.

1162
01:34:07,541 --> 01:34:10,166
He has no other option but to be with you.
Do your work and get lost!

1163
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:11,333
I will get lost from here.

1164
01:34:11,916 --> 01:34:13,375
Don't you worry.

1165
01:34:13,458 --> 01:34:16,291
- Viknesh!
- May you both be happy and prosperous.

1166
01:34:16,375 --> 01:34:19,083
After this another woman.
After that another one.

1167
01:34:19,166 --> 01:34:20,708
- I'm leaving this place.
- Stop!

1168
01:34:24,208 --> 01:34:25,500
Do you want to see?

1169
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:28,791
Don't act foolishly!

1170
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:30,375
I will not do anything, my dear.

1171
01:34:30,458 --> 01:34:31,833
Can you talk normally?

1172
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:34,208
How? Can you give an example?

1173
01:34:34,291 --> 01:34:36,125
Can you take this lightly, please?

1174
01:34:36,208 --> 01:34:38,666
You do your work, I will do my work.

1175
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:41,791
I beg you. Please forget about this.

1176
01:34:41,875 --> 01:34:43,541
- Is she crazy?
- Hey, keep quiet.

1177
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:45,500
Yes! I'm crazy!

1178
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:47,500
I'm crazy!

1179
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:49,916
Hey Preethy, stop!

1180
01:34:51,458 --> 01:34:53,625
Are you okay? Get up!

1181
01:34:53,708 --> 01:34:54,791
I'm not okay!

1182
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:56,291
Is she crazy?

1183
01:34:58,333 --> 01:34:59,416
You wait!

1184
01:35:28,833 --> 01:35:29,791
Preethy!

1185
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:32,083
Preethy!

1186
01:35:33,791 --> 01:35:34,791
Preethy!

1187
01:35:36,916 --> 01:35:38,083
Preethy!

1188
01:35:39,416 --> 01:35:40,333
Preethy!

1189
01:35:46,375 --> 01:35:47,666
Oh shit!

1190
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,041
We didn't know what to do.

1191
01:36:07,125 --> 01:36:08,791
<i>I was scared,</i>

1192
01:36:08,875 --> 01:36:10,208
But Vaishnavi was okay.

1193
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:12,041
<i>She started planning.</i>

1194
01:36:12,125 --> 01:36:14,375
<i>We planned to make
Aishwarya the scapegoat.</i>

1195
01:36:16,291 --> 01:36:19,625
<i>First, we destroyed
all the evidence and fingerprints.</i>

1196
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:28,208
<i>We moved Preethy's dead body to her unit.</i>

1197
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:31,500
It was hard to move the dead body
without being seen by anyone.

1198
01:37:37,916 --> 01:37:40,041
<i>We created the scene
as though it was done by Aishwarya.</i>

1199
01:37:40,125 --> 01:37:43,000
<i>Then we left
before Aishwarya arrived there.</i>

1200
01:37:50,833 --> 01:37:52,500
<i>Vaishnavi instructed me to go back.</i>

1201
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,625
I went back and waited.

1202
01:37:58,708 --> 01:38:00,125
<i>But I heard nothing from her.</i>

1203
01:38:03,166 --> 01:38:05,833
<i>Night came. Still nothing.</i>

1204
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:09,791
Then we realized that Aishwarya
did not go back to her unit.

1205
01:38:09,875 --> 01:38:11,458
Still not back?

1206
01:38:11,541 --> 01:38:12,833
Not yet!

1207
01:38:12,916 --> 01:38:14,625
I think she went back to her hometown.

1208
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:16,500
That's right. It's the weekends.

1209
01:38:16,583 --> 01:38:18,125
Don't you worry.

1210
01:38:18,208 --> 01:38:20,666
- Go sleep.
- Okay.

1211
01:38:22,541 --> 01:38:25,000
She didn't come back
even on the following day,

1212
01:38:25,083 --> 01:38:28,458
You went on with your daily routine.
Don't show your stress to anyone, okay?

1213
01:38:28,541 --> 01:38:30,041
Okay!

1214
01:38:30,583 --> 01:38:34,291
I started to worry if we missed out
on any evidence at the scene.

1215
01:38:38,166 --> 01:38:41,041
Then I thought of Preethy's cell phone.

1216
01:38:44,375 --> 01:38:45,958
- Hello?
- I lost my anklet.

1217
01:38:46,041 --> 01:38:47,750
- Where did you drop it?
- I'm not sure where.

1218
01:38:47,833 --> 01:38:49,916
I searched the corridor
and stairs but I can't find it.

1219
01:38:50,875 --> 01:38:51,791
Oh shit!

1220
01:38:51,875 --> 01:38:54,791
On Saturday night,
we went back to Preethy's unit.

1221
01:39:11,333 --> 01:39:14,541
<i>Vaishnavi found her anklet.</i>

1222
01:39:14,625 --> 01:39:17,250
<i>When I checked Preethy's cell phone</i>

1223
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:19,958
<i>I found out that she has sent
a voice message to Aishwarya.</i>

1224
01:39:21,416 --> 01:39:24,208
<i>- Don't act foolishly!
- I will not do anything, my dear.</i>

1225
01:39:26,708 --> 01:39:29,833
Oh my God! We're dead!
What are we going to do now?

1226
01:39:30,375 --> 01:39:32,583
Delete everything! Delete the iCloud too.

1227
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:35,083
What's the use? Aisyu has it, right?

1228
01:39:35,166 --> 01:39:38,333
Look here! There's no blue tick,
which means she has not read it yet.

1229
01:39:38,416 --> 01:39:40,583
- So we're still safe.
- All right.

1230
01:39:42,583 --> 01:39:44,583
I'll reformat Preethy's cell phone.

1231
01:39:45,916 --> 01:39:47,833
her iCloud account.

1232
01:39:47,916 --> 01:39:49,125
Where are you going?

1233
01:39:49,208 --> 01:39:52,000
I tried to delete Aishwarya's iCloud data.

1234
01:39:53,666 --> 01:39:55,333
<i>Using Aishwarya's laptop,</i>

1235
01:39:55,416 --> 01:39:58,041
<i>we tried to delete
the voice message sent by Preethy.</i>

1236
01:39:58,625 --> 01:39:59,875
<i>But it was unsuccessful.</i>

1237
01:39:59,958 --> 01:40:01,166
Shit!

1238
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:02,208
It could not be deleted.

1239
01:40:03,375 --> 01:40:04,500
Let's go.

1240
01:40:04,583 --> 01:40:07,875
Our only worry was Aishwarya.

1241
01:40:08,791 --> 01:40:10,750
Because she's the only evidence we've got.

1242
01:40:12,166 --> 01:40:15,750
We waited for her, but she
did not appear until the end.

1243
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,000
PEREPAT VILLAGE

1244
01:41:15,083 --> 01:41:16,166
Dhivya.

1245
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:27,375
Don't hurt her, madam!
She's innocent, madam!

1246
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,291
Madam, we found this in Aishwarya's room.

1247
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:38,166
Maybe she's at that place.

1248
01:43:49,208 --> 01:43:51,250
Dhivya attacked my family.

1249
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:53,125
Collect information about her.

1250
01:43:53,208 --> 01:43:55,500
I want to know
why she has a grudge against me.

1251
01:43:55,583 --> 01:43:56,625
Yes, Deepak.

1252
01:43:56,708 --> 01:44:00,166
Recently, she's been in contact
with a person named Eswar.

1253
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:02,708
- Madam.
<i>- I've checked that person's background.</i>

1254
01:44:02,791 --> 01:44:03,791
The information says that

1255
01:44:03,875 --> 01:44:06,666
he's the cousin of Jay,
one of the criminals that we shot dead.

1256
01:44:07,166 --> 01:44:09,083
<i>What's shocking is that</i>

1257
01:44:09,166 --> 01:44:12,083
<i>Jay is Dhivya's boyfriend.</i>

1258
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:31,166
Why madam?

1259
01:44:31,833 --> 01:44:33,166
Does it hurt?

1260
01:44:35,250 --> 01:44:37,666
You must be so frustrated, right?

1261
01:44:38,166 --> 01:44:40,125
That's how I felt too!

1262
01:44:40,208 --> 01:44:41,625
When you shot Jay,

1263
01:44:41,708 --> 01:44:45,083
I know the risk of this job
before I accepted the position.

1264
01:44:46,083 --> 01:44:48,041
Come! Are you frustrated with me?

1265
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:49,583
Come show it!

1266
01:45:25,166 --> 01:45:27,666
If I wasn't shot by Jay on that day,

1267
01:45:28,291 --> 01:45:31,416
I'm sure I would have
shot you on that day!

1268
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,166
That's it!

1269
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:25,166
Everything I said
about Sharath is not true, madam.

1270
01:46:27,833 --> 01:46:29,291
What happened was...

1271
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:39,458
<i>I wanted to end all this
by informing Shiva that I choose Aathi.</i>

1272
01:47:00,375 --> 01:47:02,958
- What are you doing here, Aathi?
- Just drinking coffee.

1273
01:47:07,041 --> 01:47:10,208
Go meet, Shiva, he's waiting for madam!

1274
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:13,541
It's not what you think! I was
worried that you would act recklessly.

1275
01:47:13,625 --> 01:47:14,583
Try to understand Aathi!

1276
01:47:14,666 --> 01:47:15,916
You're showing your true colors?

1277
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,416
- That's not it, Aathi!
- You're showing your true colors?

1278
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,666
- Please listen to what I have to say!
- You're showing your true colors?

1279
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:20,875
All women are the same!

1280
01:47:21,458 --> 01:47:22,333
Catch her!

1281
01:47:22,416 --> 01:47:24,083
Stop this, Aathi! No!

1282
01:47:24,708 --> 01:47:26,875
Let me go!

1283
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:28,875
Let me go, Sharath!

1284
01:47:37,416 --> 01:47:40,541
<i>I didn't expect
Aathi will behave like this!</i>

1285
01:47:41,666 --> 01:47:46,583
<i>He never lets me explain things.</i>

1286
01:47:46,666 --> 01:47:48,791
<i>He hurts me.</i>

1287
01:47:52,666 --> 01:47:56,750
<i>Aathi tricked Shiva to reach that place.</i>

1288
01:47:58,875 --> 01:48:01,041
<i>They fought each other.</i>

1289
01:48:07,375 --> 01:48:10,333
<i>They broke my hand when they fought.</i>

1290
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:14,291
<i>In that scary situation,</i>

1291
01:48:15,125 --> 01:48:18,125
<i>Shiva shot Sharath.</i>

1292
01:48:27,708 --> 01:48:29,250
<i>After the death of Sharath,</i>

1293
01:48:30,375 --> 01:48:32,000
<i>we didn't know what to do.</i>

1294
01:48:32,833 --> 01:48:36,333
We planned to make Aathi the murderer.

1295
01:48:42,333 --> 01:48:44,458
<i>I never imagined
the police would go after me.</i>

1296
01:48:44,541 --> 01:48:45,666
<i>I tried to escape.</i>

1297
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:47,416
<i>Then I contacted Shiva.</i>

1298
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:05,166
Aisyu!

1299
01:49:06,958 --> 01:49:08,083
Aisyu!

1300
01:49:08,166 --> 01:49:09,041
Shiva!

1301
01:49:10,208 --> 01:49:11,583
Shiva!

1302
01:49:15,958 --> 01:49:18,166
Let's leave this place, Aisyu!

1303
01:49:24,083 --> 01:49:25,416
What are we going to do Shiva?

1304
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,125
I don't know.

1305
01:49:27,208 --> 01:49:28,166
Take out your phone.

1306
01:50:05,083 --> 01:50:06,333
What are we doing here, Shiva?

1307
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:17,750
What is he doing?

1308
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,208
I found a victim being kidnapped
by two suspects.

1309
01:50:34,083 --> 01:50:35,416
On a jetty in Kapar.

1310
01:50:56,916 --> 01:50:57,750
Shiva.

1311
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:00,875
Shiva.

1312
01:51:00,958 --> 01:51:02,583
Can you keep quiet, Aisyu?

1313
01:51:15,416 --> 01:51:17,333
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Shiva?

1314
01:51:18,333 --> 01:51:19,250
Shiva. Please, Shiva!

1315
01:51:19,333 --> 01:51:21,041
Shiva, listen to me!

1316
01:51:21,125 --> 01:51:23,250
Please, Shiva! Put the gun down!

1317
01:51:23,333 --> 01:51:24,375
Please, Shiva!

1318
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,708
Please, Shiva! Put the gun down!

1319
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:56,125
I can't run anymore, Aisyu.

1320
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,333
I'm reluctant to do this!

1321
01:51:59,666 --> 01:52:01,750
The police have started to suspect you.

1322
01:52:01,833 --> 01:52:03,708
Surely they will catch me through you!

1323
01:52:04,458 --> 01:52:06,875
I'm not ready for that, Aisyu!

1324
01:52:07,458 --> 01:52:09,375
How could you shoot me, Shiva?

1325
01:52:11,291 --> 01:52:12,833
How could you shoot me, Shiva?

1326
01:52:13,416 --> 01:52:15,458
- Don't come near me, Aisyu! Go away!
- Okay, Shiva!

1327
01:52:15,541 --> 01:52:17,208
- Get away, Aisyu! I will shoot you!
- Shoot!

1328
01:52:18,375 --> 01:52:19,208
Just shoot.

1329
01:52:19,291 --> 01:52:20,333
I will shoot you, Aisyu!

1330
01:52:20,416 --> 01:52:21,416
Then just shoot.

1331
01:52:30,083 --> 01:52:31,291
I don't know what to do!

1332
01:52:32,708 --> 01:52:34,333
I don't know what to do.

1333
01:52:38,666 --> 01:52:40,208
All of this happened
because of me right, Shiva?

1334
01:52:43,458 --> 01:52:45,125
It's better you kill me.

1335
01:52:45,208 --> 01:52:46,333
Shoot me.

1336
01:52:47,333 --> 01:52:49,083
Take this, Shiva. Shoot me.

1337
01:52:49,916 --> 01:52:50,916
Shoot me.

1338
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
To save you,

1339
01:52:52,083 --> 01:52:55,208
I've written a confession note
saying that I killed Aathi and Sharath.

1340
01:52:56,541 --> 01:52:58,000
It's better if you kill me, Shiva.

1341
01:52:58,583 --> 01:52:59,708
Just kill me!

1342
01:53:00,375 --> 01:53:02,083
Oh, Mom!

1343
01:53:03,041 --> 01:53:04,166
Dad!

1344
01:53:06,083 --> 01:53:08,625
My parents! I didn't get
to speak with them just now.

1345
01:53:11,041 --> 01:53:12,958
For the last time,

1346
01:53:13,041 --> 01:53:14,625
let me call them.

1347
01:53:14,708 --> 01:53:17,708
Please, Shiva. For the last time,

1348
01:53:17,791 --> 01:53:19,625
I want to hear their voices.

1349
01:54:01,416 --> 01:54:02,833
Can you both keep quiet for a while?

1350
01:54:03,708 --> 01:54:06,083
We'll do it later, dear.
How's the plan for your yoga class?

1351
01:54:08,041 --> 01:54:10,416
I will make the class on weekends.

1352
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:11,541
You planned this previously too.

1353
01:54:11,625 --> 01:54:13,000
I became the victim.

1354
01:54:13,083 --> 01:54:15,625
I sprained my leg because of you.

1355
01:54:15,708 --> 01:54:17,583
Do you remember?
I couldn't go to the office for a week.

1356
01:54:17,666 --> 01:54:19,750
That was last year, Siddarth.

1357
01:54:21,333 --> 01:54:22,833
Your other leg is still fine, right?

1358
01:54:24,583 --> 01:54:25,458
I'm just joking!

1359
01:54:27,583 --> 01:54:29,208
I'm going now, my beloved husband.

1360
