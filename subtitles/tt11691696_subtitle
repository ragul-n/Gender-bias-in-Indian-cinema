1
00:00:00,022 --> 00:00:00,141
SHUKRANU

2
00:00:12,274 --> 00:00:16,334
'You must have heard many stories,
but perhaps not mine.'

3
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:17,956
'Who am I?'

4
00:00:18,444 --> 00:00:23,304
'Well, you can assume expansion of
the human race begins from my race.'

5
00:00:24,177 --> 00:00:26,088
'In which though the
250 million run the race.'

6
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:29,147
'But only one wins.'

7
00:00:29,784 --> 00:00:33,739
'Whenever someone tried to stop
the increasing human population...'

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,362
'They put a stop to my race.'

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,674
'Who am I?'

10
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:39,599
'I am a spermatozoon.'

11
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:42,843
'In simple English, a sperm.'

12
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:48,569
'This the story of that
dark phase of free India

13
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,536
when emergency was
declared in the country.'

14
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:52,469
'Emergency? Yes.'

15
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,564
'It is my story,

16
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:56,549
but I am not the hero of this story.'

17
00:00:56,728 --> 00:01:00,165
'Let me introduce you
to the hero of this story.'

18
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:01,984
Where are you taking me?
-Come, just come.

19
00:01:02,153 --> 00:01:03,864
Don’t misbehave!
-Tell me!

20
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:06,446
Don’t misbehave! Come.
-Tell me where are you taking me?

21
00:01:06,506 --> 00:01:07,654
Let me go!

22
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:08,913
Hey!

23
00:01:09,127 --> 00:01:12,719
I know that you are a hero,
but their baton doesn’t know that.

24
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:16,590
It will beat you up
and turn your ass red.

25
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:19,352
This is your first day of promotion.

26
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:21,478
You won't be able to even sit
in that new chair.

27
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:23,034
Let's go, hurry up.

28
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:27,213
Where are you taking me?
You look very happy.

29
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,473
Come on, tell me.

30
00:01:35,508 --> 00:01:36,486
What is it?

31
00:01:36,746 --> 00:01:38,406
Why don’t you just tell me
why are we here?

32
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,072
You are just sitting and smiling.

33
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:41,769
I'm just enjoying the biscuit.

34
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:44,958
Try to understand.
-Enjoying the biscuit!

35
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,617
Enjoy!
Enjoy the biscuit!

36
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:56,433
Oh, I see.
So, you are enjoying this biscuit, huh?

37
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,677
No, I was just...

38
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:00,573
I can see what…

39
00:02:35,746 --> 00:02:36,486
Hey!

40
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:37,635
What hey?

41
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:42,005
If you keep acting like Devdas,
Thakur will whisk Paro away.

42
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:44,302
Be a man.

43
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:46,347
You don’t get a girl
by chasing after her.

44
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:49,647
You speak like you have
a PhD on the topic.

45
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:51,987
You hardly know me.

46
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,306
Then enlighten me.

47
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:55,284
My father had named me Inder
for a reason.

48
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:56,632
Greetings, father.

49
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,140
Bhanu, I am someone who can
even make a married woman stray.

50
00:03:00,918 --> 00:03:02,762
So unmarried girls are just…

51
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:21,874
Harder.

52
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:23,244
Yes?

53
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:31,999
Why here?
-Why?

54
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:33,333
Yes, wrestler?

55
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,429
No. Not a wrestler, Inder.
My name is Inder.

56
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,445
I don’t care what your name is.

57
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,441
What are you doing here?

58
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:42,226
I like wrestling.

59
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:44,129
So, I thought I should learn it.

60
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:46,026
One doesn't learn wrestling.

61
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:47,782
You wrestle in the ground.

62
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:49,982
Yes, right.
So you go ahead and do it.

63
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:51,974
I just came here today to watch.

64
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:53,278
You have a great setup here.

65
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,700
Done with the inspection?

66
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:57,241
Now, you will learn.

67
00:04:58,901 --> 00:04:59,872
Come on.

68
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:01,708
Make a move.

69
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,452
Take my hand.

70
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,349
Great.	 Hey, jump!

71
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,149
Broke his ribs.
That was amazing.

72
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,722
Lift him up.

73
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:22,787
Well done, my boy. Good going.

74
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:25,625
There goes his spine

75
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:28,684
Now swirl him around and
throw him on the ground.

76
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:31,958
Excellent.

77
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:34,654
He's done for.

78
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:42,292
The one who can even make
married women stray

79
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:44,396
Mr. Inder a.k.a. Bittu,

80
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:46,477
we are men?
-Yes, yes.

81
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:49,085
We don’t follow girls.

82
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:50,351
We don’t.

83
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:57,178
Scoundrel, I am dying in pain here
and you are trying to taunt me?

84
00:05:57,474 --> 00:05:59,889
Brother, the bungalow you went to,

85
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:02,459
has been aptly labelled as the
Romeos' Graveyard by Delhites.

86
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,265
What?

87
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:06,540
Akriti is a wrestler
Bheeshm Lathwal's daughter.

88
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:09,307
Her three brothers are also wrestlers.

89
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,500
I have heard that

90
00:06:14,026 --> 00:06:16,796
they have sent many
to an early grave.

91
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:21,451
And the ones who survive,
they make them bonded labour.

92
00:06:21,578 --> 00:06:22,511
Really?

93
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:33,676
You are fortunate to come out of there,
although a little broken.

94
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:38,195
So, in future, if you ever
wish to commit suicide… - Yes.

95
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:40,151
You know where to go.

96
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,836
I don’t want to go there.

97
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:43,132
I don't want to.

98
00:06:47,985 --> 00:06:50,481
'This is Aakashwani.'

99
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:53,006
'Home Minister K Brahmananda Reddy,

100
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:56,170
while assuring that emergency
could soon be over and said…’

101
00:06:57,806 --> 00:06:59,895
How will I get married in this state?

102
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:02,798
Bhanu…

103
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,836
Would you like some tea?
-Yes, I would.

104
00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:08,584
Then make two cups of tea.

105
00:07:10,703 --> 00:07:12,207
Add some ginger in it.

106
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,962
How are you doing, brother Inder?

107
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,450
Why want to know
how he is doing, uncle?

108
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:25,310
He is getting excellent massages.

109
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Yet he won't leave hope.
-Why should I?

110
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:31,303
Look over there.
He is back.

111
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:33,555
He is one determined lover boy.

112
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:36,081
He came back even after
being thrashed so badly.

113
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,644
By the way girls,

114
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:40,348
he's shinning even after the
thrashing, isn't he?

115
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:43,751
You will get me beaten up as well.

116
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:47,092
Look confidently.

117
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:49,907
Come on, let's check
this Romeo's determination.

118
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:50,967
Yes, let's go. - Yes.

119
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:52,870
Are they coming this way?
-They are coming here.

120
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,618
Is it?

121
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:55,928
I am getting worried now.
Don’t worry. Keep it there.

122
00:07:56,232 --> 00:07:58,550
Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
Yes.

123
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:00,284
Be confident.

124
00:08:00,344 --> 00:08:02,291
I will go ahead now.
You too come along. Ok?

125
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,740
One, two, three.
-Come on.

126
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:07,762
Bhanu!

127
00:08:13,964 --> 00:08:15,890
You are very stubborn.

128
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:16,757
What?

129
00:08:17,002 --> 00:08:18,105
Come on, brother-in-law.

130
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,357
Back to stare at girls even
after getting thrashed?

131
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,186
No...

132
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:23,424
At least clear this out.
Who do you come here to stare at?

133
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:24,265
Her?

134
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:25,924
Me?
-Her?

135
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:28,657
Her lover boy ran away
with his tail between his legs.

136
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,509
Oh, I see.
Her.

137
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:32,931
No use.
She is Manglik.

138
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:34,790
And also a child bride.

139
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,120
But that doesn't concern you.
You will still keep staring, won't you?

140
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,239
Hey! What is happening here?
No, I…

141
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:41,431
Are you troubling them?
What are you doing?

142
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:42,636
Are you troubling them?

143
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,574
We were just talking.
-What were you talking about?

144
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,351
You look like a decent boy.

145
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:48,033
Yet you behave like a loafer.

146
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:49,678
Don’t you have any shame?
-Sir...

147
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,145
Should I teach you a lesson?

148
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:52,893
Don’t hurt him, Sardarji.
Should I teach you a lesson?

149
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:55,382
Let him go, Sardarji.
-Sir. -Should I beat you up?

150
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,824
It will teach you a lesson.

151
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,551
Sardarji, he is a nice boy.

152
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:02,003
Do nice boys behave like this?
Look how he is behaving!

153
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:04,017
Come on.
-Useless.

154
00:09:04,284 --> 00:09:05,454
Let's go, brother.

155
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,552
If she wanted to insult me,
she should've called me alone.

156
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,842
Have you done PhD in dramatics?

157
00:09:29,324 --> 00:09:32,116
Why enquire about the path
you shouldn’t be venturing into?

158
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:34,780
Bhanu, I wanted to take that path.

159
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:37,588
That was the wrong path.

160
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,729
There was a photo in yesterday's letter.

161
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:43,870
Did you see it?

162
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:46,278
What will I do by seeing the photo?

163
00:09:47,048 --> 00:09:49,721
I just got insulted because
of one girl.

164
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:51,085
I mean a little...

165
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:53,989
Gave me no respect at all.
Took me for a beggar.

166
00:09:55,148 --> 00:09:56,111
There...

167
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,159
Do you see that moon?

168
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:06,483
And that marigold flower?

169
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,394
Marigold flower.

170
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:15,835
Amazing.

171
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:19,516
That moon is out of your reach.
-Yes.

172
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:20,871
But…

173
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,994
That marigold flower

174
00:10:25,593 --> 00:10:26,689
is sure shot

175
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,314
within your reach.
-Yes.

176
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:31,776
But...

177
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:34,354
But if Mr. Inder

178
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:38,154
keeps staring at the moon,

179
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:42,085
then that marigold flower,

180
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:45,825
someone will pluck and walk away.

181
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:49,484
Do you understand?

182
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:06,114
Marigold flower!

183
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,359
Let me go!
-Move!

184
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:11,108
Let me go! Where are you taking me?

185
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:12,403
Let me go!

186
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,870
Wait a minute! What's going on, brother?

187
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,012
Where are you taking him?
-Let me go

188
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:16,256
It doesn’t concern you. Leave.

189
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:18,426
I should leave so that
you can kidnap him?

190
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,771
Back off!
-You back off!

191
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:22,735
Move! Let him go!
Move!

192
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:23,609
Let go!

193
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:26,098
Let me go! Where are you taking me?

194
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,957
Let me go!

195
00:11:28,017 --> 00:11:28,936
Look at that.

196
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:31,344
They are kidnapping him
right in front of everyone.

197
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:32,499
Come I will write your report.

198
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,682
No, sir. No report.
They will take him away.

199
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:36,316
I'll handle it.
-What is my fault?

200
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:37,627
Hey!
-Yes, sir.

201
00:11:41,729 --> 00:11:44,040
Sir, this… where are you…
what's going on here?

202
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,955
Don’t worry.
Come on.

203
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:46,748
I don’t want to go with you.

204
00:11:46,808 --> 00:11:47,977
Come on.
-Hey…

205
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:55,156
Let me go!
I am getting married.

206
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:56,949
I have a train to catch in the evening.

207
00:11:57,222 --> 00:11:59,133
I am getting married. Let me go.

208
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,940
Sir, I have a train to catch.

209
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:08,162
'Brothers, you all are
requested to maintain peace.'

210
00:12:08,288 --> 00:12:13,029
'Remember, vasectomy is beneficial
to your family and your country.'

211
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:16,667
'One family, two children
is the slogan of the nation.'

212
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,990
I have a train to catch, sir.

213
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,253
'By deciding to get
a vasectomy done,

214
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:23,624
you will not only keep
your family happy

215
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:26,635
but will also improve
the future of the country.'

216
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,598
Come on.
-Let's go. - No way!

217
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:32,963
Make him lie down.

218
00:12:34,874 --> 00:12:35,904
Doctor!

219
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:39,096
I am going to get married.

220
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:39,940
Shut up.

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,273
Hey, Sir,,,
-I'll slap you.

222
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,199
You don’t understand.
-Sir…

223
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,759
Sir, he is about to get married.

224
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:49,708
If you are so worried about him
then take his place.

225
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:53,252
They will screw us
if we don’t meet the target.

226
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:54,526
Do you understand?

227
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:56,522
Let me go!
-Hold him tight.

228
00:12:56,582 --> 00:12:58,136
Sir, this is not…
Hold him tight.

229
00:12:58,624 --> 00:12:59,558
Don’t let him go!

230
00:13:01,877 --> 00:13:03,269
No! No!

231
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:31,788
"Rahim says, the thread of love
between people is delicate,"

232
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:37,299
"Don’t allow it to snap"
-Be careful.

233
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,752
"If it breaks once,
it cannot be mended,"

234
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:48,805
"Even if you mend it,
there will be a knot in it"

235
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:55,938
"Even if you mend it,
there will be a knot in it"

236
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,583
"Fate has deceived me"

237
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:19,257
"A fire burns within me"

238
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:24,947
"All my dreams have shattered"

239
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:30,785
"There will be no new beginnings"

240
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,483
"There will be no new dawn"

241
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,728
"Now nothing seems like
my own anymore"

242
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:45,905
"Oh Rahim of mine, O Rahim"

243
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:49,742
"You didn’t hear my pleas"

244
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:56,416
"Why did you become my enemy,
I pray?"

245
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:05,142
"What that I have lost,
is lost because of you"

246
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:12,042
"Why this punishment?"
"Oh Rahim…"

247
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:19,553
"Why this punishment?"
"Oh Rahim…"

248
00:15:31,354 --> 00:15:32,472
Look.

249
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,147
You look like a prince.

250
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,362
What happened?

251
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:48,911
Do you have someone in the city?

252
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:51,110
No.

253
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:55,799
Just…
I am just a little nervous.

254
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:57,599
Don’t be nervous.

255
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:03,214
A happy married life is
the mantra of life.

256
00:16:05,676 --> 00:16:08,950
One should stay away
from alcohol and women.

257
00:16:09,632 --> 00:16:11,120
It's your family here,

258
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:16,621
your wife will become
your worst nightmare.

259
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,724
I speak from experience.

260
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:40,857
Looks like brother Bittu
doesn’t like Reema.

261
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,249
Think Reema,
there is still time.

262
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,767
If you marry me, you stay
close to your parental home.

263
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:47,068
Are you done?

264
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:48,623
Leave.

265
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:51,660
You aren’t being hanged.
You are getting married.

266
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,972
Smile a little.

267
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:53,735
Yes.

268
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:20,866
Brother Bittu!

269
00:17:20,926 --> 00:17:22,458
Come in, don’t feel shy.

270
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:24,533
This is your room.
And your wife too.

271
00:17:25,154 --> 00:17:26,680
I am just joking.

272
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:28,807
Hey, hey, hey!

273
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:30,966
What are you doing here?

274
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:34,473
Sister-in-law, I am leaving tomorrow.
So, I thought of enquiring after you.

275
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:36,889
She is from our village,
so this is my duty.

276
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,905
So if you have done your duty
and the enquiry then please leave.

277
00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:42,460
Yes.

278
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:46,031
Munni! All of you leave as well.

279
00:17:46,187 --> 00:17:48,031
Reema. I mean sister-in-law...

280
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:50,276
Please accept.

281
00:17:51,276 --> 00:17:52,224
I am leaving.

282
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:55,326
So, brother.

283
00:17:57,097 --> 00:17:58,245
Best of luck!

284
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:03,434
Okay, Bittu.

285
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:43,693
Hey.

286
00:19:16,582 --> 00:19:18,145
Get up, it's late.

287
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:21,277
Brother-in-law has been
waiting to have tea with you.

288
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,388
And you are still not done sleeping.

289
00:19:25,174 --> 00:19:26,670
Reema has made the tea today.

290
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:27,937
Here.

291
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:30,958
What is it?

292
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,455
Is everything alright?

293
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:36,122
Go and get ready. Go on.

294
00:19:51,063 --> 00:19:52,737
Reema, come here, please.

295
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:54,804
I'll be right back.

296
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,052
Yes, sister?

297
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:02,407
Why is your bedsheet so clean?

298
00:20:02,652 --> 00:20:04,252
I didn’t do anything, sister.

299
00:20:04,748 --> 00:20:06,266
Why didn’t you?

300
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:08,643
What happened last night?
Nothing, sister.

301
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:11,217
He came and went to sleep.

302
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:12,646
He went to sleep?

303
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,750
Why didn’t you wake him up
if he was sleeping?

304
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,409
If he didn’t initiate
then you should have.

305
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:21,931
You see, Bittu is a little shy.

306
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:48,588
"A beautiful body… has many shades"

307
00:20:49,678 --> 00:21:00,952
Which shade would you like to see?"

308
00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:08,374
"My body… is on fire"

309
00:21:10,174 --> 00:21:21,530
"Which part would you like to see?"

310
00:21:28,352 --> 00:21:29,774
It's very hot in here.

311
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:55,248
"My cheeks look pink"

312
00:21:55,403 --> 00:21:59,359
"You don’t know their true colour"

313
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:02,870
"My cheeks look pink"

314
00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:06,292
"You don’t know their true colour"

315
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:08,284
"My lips…"

316
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:13,700
I was checking the cassette.

317
00:22:15,322 --> 00:22:16,322
What?

318
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:22,056
No, it was very hot inside so

319
00:22:22,116 --> 00:22:24,426
I thought I should sleep on the terrace.

320
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:25,551
Hear that!

321
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:27,906
It's not snowing on the terrace.

322
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:29,861
It's not so hot that you will melt.

323
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:30,869
Go inside.

324
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:32,654
No, I'll sleep on the terrace.

325
00:22:32,714 --> 00:22:33,824
Go inside.

326
00:22:35,594 --> 00:22:36,586
Why are you...

327
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:39,432
Why are you…

328
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:57,416
How can my son be like this?

329
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,675
They had to change my bed
on the next day of my wedding.

330
00:23:03,253 --> 00:23:05,105
Send both them to Khajuraho.

331
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,319
Mind will get excited
and the body will react too.

332
00:23:09,445 --> 00:23:10,993
But Khajuraho is too far away.

333
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:13,148
His leave will be over
by the time they reach there.

334
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,792
Feed him drumsticks
and he will be fine.

335
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:27,163
Feed him crushed rhino horns.

336
00:23:27,223 --> 00:23:30,253
Not rhino horns, a tiger's penis.

337
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:32,348
Give him crushed bee stinger.

338
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:34,666
He'll get his on hop.

339
00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:40,081
If you permit, may I try something?

340
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:45,325
People will recognise us.
-Quite! Keep quite.

341
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:46,835
This way.

342
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:48,672
Here.
Where are we going? Not me.

343
00:23:48,814 --> 00:23:49,976
Come on. We are almost there.

344
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:55,539
Why have you brought me here,
brother-in-law?

345
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:57,806
To get you treated.

346
00:23:57,866 --> 00:24:00,651
But like this, stealthily, like a thief?

347
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:01,695
Keep quiet.

348
00:24:01,755 --> 00:24:03,414
Look, the doctor is here.

349
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:07,177
Hello.
-Yes?

350
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:09,770
We wanted to show you.

351
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,800
Here?

352
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,977
I think inside would be better.

353
00:24:16,561 --> 00:24:21,013
By the way,
which one of you is the patient?

354
00:24:21,236 --> 00:24:23,532
Patient?
There is no patient.

355
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:27,761
He has a problem.

356
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:28,716
Oh.

357
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:30,708
And what is your problem?

358
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:32,627
My problem?
-Yes.

359
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:34,798
I have no problem. I am absolutely fine.

360
00:24:34,858 --> 00:24:37,557
Then why do you wish
to seek fun at his expense?

361
00:24:38,565 --> 00:24:39,691
You come inside with me.

362
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,061
In my cabin.

363
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:43,151
Brother-in-law,
I think he too has a problem.

364
00:24:43,285 --> 00:24:44,714
Now that you are here,
you should show him.

365
00:24:44,855 --> 00:24:47,299
You are wearing a cap and goggles.
So your identity remains a secret. Go.

366
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:55,249
What is the problem?

367
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,168
Wet dreams?
Premature ejaculation?

368
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,245
Or watery semen?
-No.

369
00:25:01,852 --> 00:25:03,067
I don’t have a problem.

370
00:25:03,222 --> 00:25:05,659
You don't have a problem?
Then you came here for a stroll?

371
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:08,889
Look mister, if don't tell how will
I suggest a treatment?

372
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:11,889
What treatment will you suggest?
A rhino's horn?

373
00:25:12,237 --> 00:25:13,082
Or a tiger's penis?

374
00:25:13,142 --> 00:25:15,733
You want me to get stung by a bee?
Or ask me to eat drumsticks?

375
00:25:15,874 --> 00:25:17,792
Or do you have any
other great treatment like this?

376
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:19,733
First tell me what the problem is.

377
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,370
Doctor, the problem is that
I got married a week ago.

378
00:25:24,007 --> 00:25:26,333
And the whole world knows,
I am unable to do anything.

379
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,762
And I am unable to do anything
because I was forcibly sterilized.

380
00:25:31,962 --> 00:25:33,525
Do you have a treatment for that?

381
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:35,495
He wants to treat me!

382
00:25:35,643 --> 00:25:37,502
I don’t have a treatment,
but I do have a solution.

383
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:38,443
Sit down.

384
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:40,176
Tell me,

385
00:25:40,953 --> 00:25:42,516
how many days has it
been since the vasectomy?

386
00:25:46,716 --> 00:25:47,820
Some...

387
00:25:48,887 --> 00:25:50,324
10-12 days.

388
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:53,568
You are sterilized,
that doesn't make you impotent.

389
00:25:54,406 --> 00:25:57,613
No crops will grow,
but you can still plough the land.

390
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,005
Plough…

391
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,998
It means you won't have any problem
in keeping your wife happy.

392
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:08,190
But you won't be able to procreate.

393
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:12,167
Heed my advice.
And think about procreating later.

394
00:26:12,997 --> 00:26:14,057
For the time being,

395
00:26:14,665 --> 00:26:15,983
think about your wife

396
00:26:16,664 --> 00:26:18,049
My wife.
-Yes.

397
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:21,553
This is for you.

398
00:26:24,731 --> 00:26:25,760
Oh!

399
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,560
For the plough?

400
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:29,538
It's perfume, mister.

you go close to your wife.'

402
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:07,915
There are a lot of mosquitoes here

403
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:11,598
Reema?

404
00:27:12,613 --> 00:27:13,598
Hey, Reema.

405
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:15,176
What happened?

406
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:16,924
Do you want something?

407
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:18,568
No, just…

408
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,583
not feeling sleepy.

409
00:27:21,954 --> 00:27:23,502
I can't sleep either.

410
00:27:24,221 --> 00:27:25,643
There are a lot of mosquitoes here.

411
00:27:27,265 --> 00:27:29,724
So, how did you like your new house?

412
00:27:35,998 --> 00:27:37,598
It is a very nice house.

413
00:27:39,221 --> 00:27:41,213
People in the house are also very nice.

414
00:27:43,057 --> 00:27:44,020
And what about me?

415
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:48,182
I didn’t get a chance to know you.

416
00:27:50,537 --> 00:27:52,204
Yes... No…

417
00:27:55,464 --> 00:27:56,642
I was very tired.

418
00:27:56,702 --> 00:27:58,582
Were you tired or you don’t like me?

419
00:27:58,938 --> 00:28:00,412
Oh, no, no.

420
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,893
It is not so.

421
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:06,486
I thought you were a marigold but...

422
00:28:08,975 --> 00:28:10,827
you turned out to be a rose.

423
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:23,056
No, I don’t want to force.
-A mosquito.

424
00:28:23,604 --> 00:28:24,293
Huh?

425
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,900

was wearing in that song?

Yes. It was good.

00:36:26,272 --> 00:36:28,145
You don’t get paid to eat
betel leaves here, Tiwari.

540
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:30,453
Stop smiling and start working harder.

541
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,035
Didn’t you understand?

542
00:36:33,518 --> 00:36:35,408
Mr. Inder!
There is a trunk call for you.

543
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,865
Hello?
-Hello.

544
00:36:46,543 --> 00:36:47,856
This is Reema speaking.

545
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:50,069
I am calling from your sister's place.
How are you?

546
00:36:50,783 --> 00:36:51,497
Good.

547
00:36:51,858 --> 00:36:53,502
I am sure you must have
received the good news.

548
00:36:53,697 --> 00:36:55,168
I am at my parental home.

549
00:36:55,355 --> 00:36:59,992
But your father wants me to give
birth to the first heir in our house.

550
00:37:03,634 --> 00:37:04,615
Hello?

551
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:08,624
Hello?

552
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:10,384
It must be good news for you.

553
00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:13,860
What do you mean?

554
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:16,643
You know what I mean.

555
00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:18,799
What are you saying?

556
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,566
Are you feeling alright?

557
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:21,583
I am hanging up now.

558
00:37:34,745 --> 00:37:36,382
Did you talk to him?

559
00:37:38,748 --> 00:37:39,801
What happened?

560
00:37:40,183 --> 00:37:41,423
Is everything alright?

561
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:43,212
I think he doesn't want a child.

562
00:37:45,794 --> 00:37:46,934
It is not so.

563
00:37:47,561 --> 00:37:50,619
Do you remember how sad
he was during the wedding?

564
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:54,687
He is a little scared of responsibilities.

565
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,984
That's all.

566
00:37:56,128 --> 00:37:59,164
Everything will be fine once
he will hold the baby in his arms.

567
00:38:01,132 --> 00:38:02,712
Come on now, give me a smile.

568
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,565
Otherwise, your child too
will be born a cry-baby.

569
00:38:09,136 --> 00:38:10,903
I said, what do I need to do, brother?

570
00:38:11,185 --> 00:38:12,432
He said, nothing.

571
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,494
I said, 200 rupees for doing nothing?

572
00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:15,900
Then do it.

573
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:19,448
I said, go ahead.
He took me inside a building.

574
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,151
He took me inside a building
and made me lie on a bed.

575
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:26,046
As soon as he took a blade out,
I lost my mind.

576
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,516
I thought he is taking my manhood
away in exchange of 200 rupees!

577
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,005
They at least tried to
lure you with money.

578
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:38,022
At my place they are taking the
entire village for it at gunpoint.

579
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:40,084
Teenagers, young and old.

580
00:38:40,144 --> 00:38:41,844
They aren't sparing anyone.
What can you do?

581
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:43,785
Chaudhary of my village

582
00:38:43,845 --> 00:38:46,850
wouldn’t stop even after
having a dozen children.

583
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,241
A dozen?
-Yes.

584
00:38:48,301 --> 00:38:50,066
He would walk like this, with pride.

585
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,771
One day police came
to take him away.

586
00:38:52,959 --> 00:38:55,317
And all his manliness just disappeared.

587
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:58,295
He was begging them to let him go.

588
00:38:58,355 --> 00:39:02,247
"Sir, I have a second
wife who is young."

589
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:05,477
'They just took him and
got his vasectomy done.'

590
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,036
Mr. Inder,

591
00:39:34,653 --> 00:39:36,874
do you want to break Kumbhkarana's
record for sleeping?

592
00:39:37,184 --> 00:39:38,050
Huh?

593
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:39,456
Wake up!

594
00:39:39,938 --> 00:39:43,451
Otherwise that demon Chandil
will make Tiwari take your place.

595
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:44,540
Get up!

596
00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:49,480
I will break your fast.

597
00:39:49,812 --> 00:39:51,088
Get up.
Hurry up.

598
00:39:51,463 --> 00:39:53,157
Alcohol with soda.

599
00:39:55,696 --> 00:39:56,806
Have it.

600
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:03,123
Look, Inder.

601
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:05,554
Your wife did what she had to.

602
00:40:05,814 --> 00:40:07,999
What can you and I do
under the circumstances?

603
00:40:08,785 --> 00:40:11,035
If you try to expose sister-in-law,

604
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:12,694
you are the one who will get exposed.

605
00:40:12,754 --> 00:40:14,922
No, you can do that if you want to

606
00:40:15,441 --> 00:40:16,681
Otherwise, move on with your life.

607
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:19,322
Don’t mourn thinking
that you are helpless.

608
00:40:20,648 --> 00:40:23,049
I mean, for someone's mistake

609
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:25,992
don't ruin your life, bro.

610
00:40:26,634 --> 00:40:27,600
Drink.

611
00:40:29,765 --> 00:40:31,200
Go ahead and drink it.

612
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:36,204
No.

613
00:40:36,753 --> 00:40:37,654
Why?

614
00:40:39,038 --> 00:40:40,898
Get some ice. I cannot like this…

615
00:40:41,843 --> 00:40:43,278
You are royal.

616
00:40:44,114 --> 00:40:45,102
I'll get it.

617
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:50,086
Don’t think too hard, man.

618
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,141
There's still greenery all around.

619
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:54,146
All you need to do is step out.

620
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,640
Inder!

621
00:41:25,322 --> 00:41:26,350
Inder!

622
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:31,588
Came back from your village?

623
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:34,932
Remember us?
We are Aakriti's brothers.

624
00:41:35,364 --> 00:41:37,052
We had taught you how to wrestle?

625
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:38,508
Did you recognise us?

626
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:43,629
Aakriti has been waiting over
there for you since so long.

627
00:41:44,292 --> 00:41:46,751
But you went missing.
Where did you disappear?

628
00:41:47,912 --> 00:41:49,383
Come along, father wants to meet you.

629
00:41:49,722 --> 00:41:50,465
Come on.

630
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,631
Father, it’s him.

631
00:42:11,638 --> 00:42:13,455
Do you want to be a tiger or a goat?

632
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:15,497
He looks like a goat.

633
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:17,386
Tell me, my boy.

634
00:42:19,052 --> 00:42:20,314
What do you want to be?

635
00:42:20,985 --> 00:42:22,420
I'll be whatever you want me to be.

636
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:24,504
Father, let's turn him
into a peacock, huh?

637
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:30,439
Fine,

638
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:32,466
then be a goat.

639
00:43:13,384 --> 00:43:14,891
What are you all doing here?

640
00:43:15,057 --> 00:43:16,413
Go and wrestle.

641
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:19,471
What is your name?

642
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:20,842
G...  Inder.

643
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,460
And G stands for what?

644
00:43:24,038 --> 00:43:26,411
Goat, gangster or geek?

645
00:43:27,248 --> 00:43:28,300
G for God.

646
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,263
You are God?

647
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,165
No.

648
00:43:32,807 --> 00:43:36,031
Just letting you know
another word starting with G.

649
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:39,102
So, now you want to teach me English?

650
00:43:39,162 --> 00:43:41,431
Father, let's test how
good he is in English.

651
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:43,422
And who will do that?

652
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:48,845
Father, Gobar will.

653
00:43:49,725 --> 00:43:50,519
Yes, father.

654
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:52,689
Hey Gobar, come here.

655
00:43:53,036 --> 00:43:53,930
Listen…

656
00:43:54,406 --> 00:43:57,176
It's Gover-dhan.

657
00:43:57,486 --> 00:43:58,878
Ya… whatever.

658
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:00,291
You wealth-less dung…

659
00:44:00,413 --> 00:44:01,747
You study in college?

660
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:03,291
So today, we will test you.

661
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,764
Say whatever knowledge
you have in English.

662
00:44:05,966 --> 00:44:08,771
Ask such a tough question
that he goes mute.

663
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,220
Go on.

664
00:44:11,972 --> 00:44:13,739
What is your name?

665
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:18,708
Scoundrel, even I know that!

666
00:44:19,141 --> 00:44:20,360
Ask something tough.

667
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:31,581
What is the capital of Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics?

668
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:38,736
Moscow.

669
00:44:39,255 --> 00:44:40,265
Huh?

670
00:44:41,253 --> 00:44:42,868
Is he right?
-Yes.

671
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,813
How can such a big question
have such a short answer?

672
00:44:49,986 --> 00:44:51,169
Enough.

673
00:44:51,831 --> 00:44:53,533
Enough with testing his
knowledge of English.

674
00:44:53,593 --> 00:44:54,651
You may leave, kiddo.

675
00:44:55,553 --> 00:44:56,296
Buzz off.

676
00:44:58,091 --> 00:44:59,562
You are smart.

677
00:45:00,887 --> 00:45:02,039
How far you have studied?

678
00:45:02,163 --> 00:45:05,291
While I was studying for graduation
a got a job.

679
00:45:06,497 --> 00:45:07,802
Aren't you graduate?

680
00:45:07,953 --> 00:45:08,840
No.

681
00:45:10,138 --> 00:45:11,400
What do you do?

682
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,133
I am Chief Supervisor in
Sri Ram Mill.

683
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:19,418
Hey, Maruti.

684
00:45:19,645 --> 00:45:20,580
Yes, father.

685
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,944
Take him in.

686
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,473
But father...

687
00:45:52,094 --> 00:45:53,262
No, you have it.

688
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:00,835
Actually, father wants a graduate
son-in-law

689
00:46:01,145 --> 00:46:02,588
who is not only from body

690
00:46:02,891 --> 00:46:04,052
but also sharp from mind too.

691
00:46:04,816 --> 00:46:07,225
It seems you have played
lot of tiger and goat game.

692
00:46:09,223 --> 00:46:10,586
Yes, I have.

693
00:46:13,297 --> 00:46:14,747
A lot in childhood.

694
00:46:14,884 --> 00:46:18,360
Earlier I used to always play as tiger
but now I am just a goat.

695
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:26,088
See, the other day, my friends

696
00:46:26,148 --> 00:46:28,071
only trying to pamper our romance.

697
00:46:28,737 --> 00:46:31,124
How was I to know that Sardarji
would come and spoil everything.

698
00:46:34,882 --> 00:46:36,980
So to speak, neither am I a  Manglik

699
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:39,404
nor the Balika Badhu (Child Bride]

700
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:46,572
See, please forgive me for
whatever happened that day.

701
00:46:46,632 --> 00:46:49,607
Oh, no... what are you doing.?
You shouldn't.

702
00:46:50,927 --> 00:46:51,988
All right.

703
00:46:52,334 --> 00:46:53,538
So everything is fine then?

704
00:47:15,993 --> 00:47:19,743
"Dear, what do I say, dear"

705
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:24,285
"Entire world seems to be lovely"

706
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:28,751
"Just look at this beautiful world
from my eyes"

707
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:33,459
"See how the land smiles with me'

708
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:37,959
"I sore beyond the skies"

709
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:42,330
"The world is nowhere around me"

710
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:46,858
"Live it up my heart, you too smile"

711
00:47:47,067 --> 00:47:51,437
"Live it up my heart, you too smile"

712
00:47:51,654 --> 00:47:55,894
"Live it up my heart, you too smile"

713
00:47:56,044 --> 00:48:01,099
"Live it up my heart, you too hum"

714
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:31,628
"Finding and losing, yeah"

715
00:48:32,212 --> 00:48:36,092
"Smiling and crying, yeah"

716
00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:40,808
"It was very much within me, yeah"

717
00:48:41,262 --> 00:48:45,387
"My very existence, yeah"

718
00:48:45,812 --> 00:48:49,959
"Sinc3 when I have understood
the philosophy"

719
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:54,460
"I am living in happiness"

720
00:48:54,805 --> 00:48:58,916
"My partner is, my moon"

721
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,073
"Like I am glittering here"

722
00:49:06,899 --> 00:49:08,039
Sis, Lassi

723
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,471
No, thanks.

724
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:13,065
"Dear, what do I say, dear"

725
00:49:13,728 --> 00:49:17,399
"Entire world seems lovely"

726
00:49:17,615 --> 00:49:22,086
"Just see this beautiful world
from my eyes"

727
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:26,673
"See how the land smile with me"

728
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:31,122
"I sore beyond the skies"

729
00:49:31,252 --> 00:49:35,615
"The world is nowhere around me"

730
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:40,014
"Live it up my heart, you too smile"

731
00:49:40,273 --> 00:49:44,564
"Live it up my heart, you too smile"

732
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:49,193
"Live it up my heart, you too smile"

733
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,209
"Live it up my heart, you too hum"

734
00:50:14,744 --> 00:50:15,905
Good choice.

735
00:50:18,805 --> 00:50:20,889
The war is declared.

736
00:50:20,949 --> 00:50:22,864
The warriors are in the battle field.

737
00:50:22,924 --> 00:50:24,934
One who has fire in his chest,

738
00:50:25,158 --> 00:50:27,495
he will be the winner
in the Lathwal's bout.

739
00:50:27,675 --> 00:50:29,464
Weldon, wrestlers! Bravo!

740
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,677
Why have we come here?

741
00:50:53,242 --> 00:50:54,395
To wrestle.

742
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:56,242
Very good, wrestler! Bravo!

743
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,059
And here Maruti has put
him down on the mat.

744
00:51:01,484 --> 00:51:05,566
With this win Maruti has reached
the final round.

745
00:51:05,797 --> 00:51:08,098
Now the bout will be for the title.

When iron clashes with iron
the sparks will fly.

755
00:51:40,403 --> 00:51:44,830
Full of youth and vigour,
today's bout is great bout.

756
00:51:45,032 --> 00:51:47,160
Wrestler not outside, be in the ring.

757
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,633
Come in, come in the middle.

758
00:51:50,363 --> 00:51:52,281
Bravo, wrestlers, bravo!

759
00:51:52,475 --> 00:51:55,021
This grip is taken, and its amazing.

760
00:51:55,081 --> 00:51:57,769
This called wrist lock grip.

761
00:51:58,807 --> 00:52:01,036
Maruti has thrown him on the mat.

762
00:52:01,096 --> 00:52:04,794
And Balram has fallen flat on his face!

763
00:52:05,183 --> 00:52:07,592
Weldon, wrestler!  Weldon!

764
00:52:11,984 --> 00:52:14,408
Friends she has taken you on.

765
00:52:14,689 --> 00:52:16,932
Better go away from here. Go!

766
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:19,082
What's it, bro, you look so happy?

767
00:52:19,142 --> 00:52:20,206
Is it beginning?

768
00:52:20,266 --> 00:52:21,981
Oh, not it will just begin now, son.

769
00:52:22,132 --> 00:52:24,721
What?
-No. Movie's end was very tragic.

770
00:52:25,204 --> 00:52:27,685
I was waiting for so long.
I was about to go.

771
00:52:27,873 --> 00:52:29,099
Why didn't you go then?

772
00:52:33,614 --> 00:52:35,647
Oh, sis-in-law, I haven't met you.

773
00:52:35,957 --> 00:52:37,876
Sorry, I could not attend the wedding.

774
00:52:38,077 --> 00:52:40,796
I am Bhanu. I live with Bittu,
I mean we stay together in factory too.

775
00:52:40,856 --> 00:52:42,166
Not staying, you were.

776
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:44,697
Sis-in-law will live together now.
Yeah?

777
00:52:44,899 --> 00:52:46,832
Is he alright or is he a fool!

778
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:48,426
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

779
00:52:48,486 --> 00:52:49,579
I am like Laxman,

780
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:51,922
who is always at the feet
of Ram-Sita.

781
00:52:56,076 --> 00:52:58,730
Sis-in-law, come. Come in.
Why are you standing in cold?

782
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:00,713
Please come, come.
-What are you up to, man?

783
00:53:01,102 --> 00:53:03,366
You too come in.
Come in, sis.

784
00:53:05,754 --> 00:53:08,256
Please come. Hold on.
I will put on the lights.

785
00:53:09,316 --> 00:53:10,766
Please come. Be careful.

786
00:53:12,331 --> 00:53:13,506
I will get some water.

787
00:53:14,826 --> 00:53:16,102
Wow, wow!

788
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:17,580
Yeah.

789
00:53:19,844 --> 00:53:21,438
Hey, amazing.

790
00:53:21,906 --> 00:53:23,363
Hey, look at her Rima.

791
00:53:23,587 --> 00:53:26,378
Sis, because of her
he forgot about you.

792
00:53:27,048 --> 00:53:30,330
Inder bro, forget Praveen Bobby
and take care of your wife.

793
00:53:31,001 --> 00:53:32,328
But she is also good.

794
00:53:33,265 --> 00:53:34,008
Okay.

795
00:53:34,552 --> 00:53:36,027
It's time for me to go now.

796
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:37,981
Where will you go so late at night?

797
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:39,647
Go tomorrow at dawn.

798
00:53:39,784 --> 00:53:42,207
Oh! So I will stay. No problem.

799
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:43,339
No.

800
00:53:44,226 --> 00:53:45,985
Transportation isn’t a problem here.

801
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:46,978
Come I will drop you.

802
00:53:47,038 --> 00:53:49,094
Oh... Okay, fine.

803
00:53:49,778 --> 00:53:51,076
You take care.

804
00:53:52,576 --> 00:53:53,745
Take good care of her.

805
00:53:56,001 --> 00:53:57,530
And sis, how did you like the house?

806
00:53:59,101 --> 00:54:00,933
It's neat.
-Thank you.

807
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:03,075
Hey, brother Bhanu did not
attend your wedding?

808
00:54:04,704 --> 00:54:05,577
Yes.

809
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:07,777
He couldn't leave from office.

810
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:10,034
Oh. By the way,
where does be belong to?

811
00:54:10,438 --> 00:54:12,003
From his accent
he appears to be from Bihar.

812
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:16,280
Why are you hitting me?

813
00:54:16,547 --> 00:54:17,744
I just said he is Bihari.

814
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:19,295
You idiot!

815
00:54:19,885 --> 00:54:21,292
Damn you! Rascal!

816
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,347
Come here.

817
00:54:23,606 --> 00:54:26,787
If you had affair with Rima,
why didn't you marry her?

818
00:54:27,175 --> 00:54:29,152
Arre, what are you saying,
brother Bittu?

819
00:54:29,527 --> 00:54:32,368
Here take it! What you are saying!

820
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,546
Rascal... goggles!

821
00:54:34,606 --> 00:54:35,706
Yeah?

822
00:54:36,471 --> 00:54:38,613
Damn you, all day you stick to her
like a leech to her...

823
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,244
Scoundrel, you have also come
to drop her to the city,

824
00:54:41,304 --> 00:54:43,384
couldn't you find anyone else
in the village

825
00:54:45,376 --> 00:54:47,669
Hey... have you lost your mind?

826
00:54:51,312 --> 00:54:54,882
Rima was so restless thinking
about you

827
00:54:55,841 --> 00:54:57,428
that she left her on own.

828
00:54:58,005 --> 00:54:59,491
I called your father too.

829
00:54:59,685 --> 00:55:02,051
He said you are not at home.
So I had to come.

830
00:55:02,592 --> 00:55:05,455
But how the hell I was to know
that you so full of crap.

831
00:55:06,457 --> 00:55:08,808
What, I was stick like a leech! Yeah?

832
00:55:08,868 --> 00:55:10,906
Come I will stick to you. See...
-Hey!

833
00:55:12,796 --> 00:55:14,209
I will hit you, damn you!

834
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:25,828
You broke my goggles.

835
00:55:26,476 --> 00:55:27,839
Go to hell.

836
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,693
You go to hell! Go or I will hit.

837
00:55:30,075 --> 00:55:31,582
I am going.

838
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:33,588
You have gone mad.

839
00:55:37,852 --> 00:55:39,729
She was asking about you.

840
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,508
Whatever you say, man.

841
00:55:42,898 --> 00:55:44,434
She really loves you a lot.

842
00:55:46,021 --> 00:55:47,889
You don't being this damn love thing.

843
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,903
I too used to love her.

844
00:55:51,523 --> 00:55:52,641
But this baby?

845
00:55:54,256 --> 00:55:56,124
Look, Inder your anger is justified.

846
00:55:56,781 --> 00:55:58,934
But  in all this, what's the
fault of that child.

847
00:55:59,069 --> 00:56:01,641
Hey, Bhanu. Don't lecture me
unnecessarily.

848
00:56:01,786 --> 00:56:04,830
Hey, I haven't done PAT
that I will deliver lectures.

849
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:09,409
I am just telling you, whatever you do,
do it with due thought.

850
00:56:10,058 --> 00:56:12,430
So that child doesn't have
adverse effect.

851
00:56:13,751 --> 00:56:15,817
Those who should have
taken care of the child

852
00:56:15,877 --> 00:56:18,082
they didn't do it and sent here.

853
00:56:18,265 --> 00:56:19,636
Hey, Inder Babu.

854
00:56:20,075 --> 00:56:22,592
Nobody has sent her,
she herself has come.

855
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:24,705
And for whom has she come? You.

856
00:56:26,832 --> 00:56:28,758
She felt you were angry.
So you are.

857
00:56:31,938 --> 00:56:33,842
Man, if you live lovingly,

858
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:36,734
she will feel everything is fine.

859
00:56:36,794 --> 00:56:38,638
Then she will happily return.

860
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,537
Look, Bittu.

861
00:56:41,758 --> 00:56:43,078
It's kist matter of few days.

862
00:56:43,284 --> 00:56:45,111
Live with her lovingly.
What's the problem?

863
00:56:47,601 --> 00:56:48,763
Lovingly?
-Yeah.

864
00:56:49,087 --> 00:56:50,688
Bhanu do you understand a thing?

865
00:56:50,748 --> 00:56:53,155
I was sterilised,
The child is not mind.

866
00:56:54,973 --> 00:56:57,035
And if you are still so worried
then keep her.

867
00:56:58,722 --> 00:56:59,883
What?

868
00:57:02,305 --> 00:57:03,077
Hey...

869
00:57:44,376 --> 00:57:45,529
I will see, sis.

870
00:57:53,642 --> 00:57:54,504
Tea.

871
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:09,298
How are you?
-Good.

872
00:58:12,587 --> 00:58:14,346
Who is that girl in your house?

873
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:15,593
Bittu's wife.

874
00:58:15,653 --> 00:58:16,805
Bittu's...

875
00:58:16,865 --> 00:58:18,940
Actually I am Bittu...

876
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,620
My pet name is Bittu at home

877
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,748
because she doesn't like
the name Bhanu, so... Bittu.

878
00:58:22,964 --> 00:58:24,630
She called me Bittu.

879
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:27,437
Come on, brother Bhanu! You got
married and I didn't even know.

880
00:58:27,497 --> 00:58:29,716
Actually I too didn't know...
-What?

881
00:58:29,874 --> 00:58:32,059
That... I was grabbed and
was married forcibly.

882
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:32,807
Grabbed?

883
00:58:32,867 --> 00:58:34,793
They just grabbed like this
and forcibly...

884
00:58:34,975 --> 00:58:36,272
I had gone to a friend’s wedding,

885
00:58:36,332 --> 00:58:39,754
they grabbed my hand and made me
sit at the venue, and it was over.

886
00:58:42,611 --> 00:58:43,837
Who is this girl...

887
00:58:45,964 --> 00:58:47,291
With brother Bhanu?

888
00:58:56,211 --> 00:58:57,315
She is...

889
00:58:58,454 --> 00:59:00,004
She Bhanu's girlfriend.

890
00:59:00,235 --> 00:59:01,180
Oh.

891
00:59:10,488 --> 00:59:11,933
Ask Inder to meet me this evening.

892
00:59:11,993 --> 00:59:13,825
Yeah, yes. I got it.

893
00:59:15,855 --> 00:59:16,619
Ooh.

894
00:59:19,908 --> 00:59:21,228
-Bother Bhanu.
-Yeah?

895
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,781
You girlfriend is very pretty.

896
00:59:33,064 --> 00:59:35,970
You too have some tea.
It is really good.

897
00:59:42,129 --> 00:59:42,989
Listen.

898
00:59:49,261 --> 00:59:50,869
I have to speak to you.

899
00:59:52,707 --> 00:59:53,580
I will be back.

900
01:00:05,781 --> 01:00:07,404
Are you angry with me?

901
01:00:08,406 --> 01:00:10,252
You didn't even didn't look happy
to see me.

902
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:15,322
Why are you so worried about the baby?

903
01:00:17,407 --> 01:00:18,828
You will see, when this baby comes,

904
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:21,222
it will bring lot of happiness
in our lives.

905
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:37,635
Baby moved. Kicked, didn't it?

906
01:00:42,545 --> 01:00:43,771
I am late. I am leaving.

907
01:00:45,329 --> 01:00:46,808
Take care of yourself.

908
01:01:25,736 --> 01:01:27,178
Are you going to tuition centre?

909
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:32,240
Truly speaking,
I feel I should leave Delhi itself.

910
01:01:36,076 --> 01:01:37,648
Shall we?
-Okay.

911
01:01:47,305 --> 01:01:49,310
So you got the shock?

912
01:01:51,654 --> 01:01:53,064
My heart came spill.

913
01:01:54,107 --> 01:01:55,095
Sis-in...

914
01:01:56,089 --> 01:01:57,755
Brother Bittu.

915
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:00,315
How wonderful wife you've found?

916
01:02:01,959 --> 01:02:04,087
You know, she doesn't even
utter your name from her lips.

917
01:02:04,147 --> 01:02:05,039
Oh.

918
01:02:05,313 --> 01:02:07,945
Since then she calls, his, him...

919
01:02:08,005 --> 01:02:10,555
From him to him,
she is speaking like that.

920
01:02:11,226 --> 01:02:13,152
But I will call my husband
by name after the wedding.

921
01:02:15,337 --> 01:02:17,096
Yeah? Yeah, yeah...

922
01:02:17,306 --> 01:02:19,693
Uh, of course you can.

923
01:02:19,753 --> 01:02:20,644
Look.

924
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:24,091
You guys didn't not introduce her.
But we have become friends.

925
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:26,465
Isn't it, Reema?
-Yes.

926
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:28,592
Now let’s take Reema around Delhi.

927
01:02:28,652 --> 01:02:29,493
No, no.

928
01:02:29,781 --> 01:02:31,126
Why not?
-I have to go to office.

929
01:02:31,186 --> 01:02:32,165
Tomorrow is Sunday.

930
01:02:32,659 --> 01:02:35,356
Yeah, tomorrow is Sunday
and next day is Monday.

931
01:02:36,604 --> 01:02:38,938
In this condition probably it is
it is not right to go our.

932
01:02:38,998 --> 01:02:40,419
What do you feel?
-You're right.

933
01:02:40,479 --> 01:02:42,051
What do you mean by
"This condition"?

934
01:02:42,268 --> 01:02:44,792
She is pregnant, not sick.

935
01:02:45,578 --> 01:02:48,095
And when she can come to Delhi
in this condition,

936
01:02:48,341 --> 01:02:49,646
then what's wrong going
for sightseeing?

937
01:02:49,819 --> 01:02:50,619
That's also true.

938
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:01,458
Say yes.
-All right. If...

939
01:03:02,223 --> 01:03:03,701
Of course, let's go.

940
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:06,405
Seema, I will show you Delhi.
It will be great fun.

941
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:11,786
Brother Bittu told me the
circumstances of your marriage.

942
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:16,120
In the beginning he used to be
a bit off from me.

943
01:03:16,653 --> 01:03:17,807
Now everything is fine.

944
01:03:17,867 --> 01:03:19,372
Hey, will you have cotton candy?

945
01:03:19,432 --> 01:03:21,254
Cotton candy?
-Yeah, it's available here.

946
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:23,468
Tell me what have you
told her about the wedding?

947
01:03:23,742 --> 01:03:26,692
That I was grabbed and made to...

948
01:03:27,644 --> 01:03:29,908
I will be caught if both of them
keep talking like this.

949
01:03:30,775 --> 01:03:32,246
Are you listening?
-What?

950
01:03:32,376 --> 01:03:34,294
Yeah... yes.

951
01:03:34,618 --> 01:03:36,162
Will have cotton candy?

952
01:03:50,991 --> 01:03:51,892
Go ahead eat.

953
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,724
Come on, eat.

954
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:56,039
Reema, who else are there
in your house?

955
01:03:56,334 --> 01:03:57,450
What?
-Uh...

956
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:59,363
It is such a good place
where we are

957
01:03:59,493 --> 01:04:01,238
so first tell about this place.

958
01:04:01,298 --> 01:04:03,149
Okay. Come I will show you around.

959
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:05,209
This castle was built by
Allauddin Khilji

960
01:04:05,321 --> 01:04:07,655
had built for his other queens.

961
01:04:12,096 --> 01:04:14,273
Right. I think i should show as if..

962
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,068
Oh...

963
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:25,558
Oh, Bhanu. Please give it.

964
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:42,996
Reema.

965
01:04:43,522 --> 01:04:46,753
Why did you suddenly come to Delhi
that too in this condition?

966
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:48,950
Actually I was...

967
01:04:49,332 --> 01:04:50,389
We should go now.

968
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:53,272
It about evening and
it is getting colder.

969
01:04:53,395 --> 01:04:55,291
So, let's go.

970
01:05:16,775 --> 01:05:18,058
Wait a minute.

971
01:05:18,866 --> 01:05:20,900
Listen, something fell in my eyes.
Please see.

972
01:05:22,472 --> 01:05:24,159
Brother Bhanu, why don't you see?

973
01:05:26,604 --> 01:05:27,462
Yes.

974
01:05:28,537 --> 01:05:30,066
Done. Yeah, it's done.

975
01:05:30,254 --> 01:05:31,558
Is it out?

976
01:05:31,955 --> 01:05:34,458
Brother Inder, shall we go too?

977
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:38,914
What happened?
Is Reema Bhanu's wife of yours?

978
01:05:40,033 --> 01:05:41,605
Me? What do you mean?

979
01:05:42,723 --> 01:05:44,403
To keep he her head,
it is your shoulder.

980
01:05:44,591 --> 01:05:46,473
She can only see the
residual of Lassi on your face.

981
01:05:47,612 --> 01:05:49,516
And now it's you to clear her eyes?

982
01:05:50,604 --> 01:05:52,717
This Bhanu is impotent, not blind.
Is he?

983
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,219
Bhanu is impotent?

984
01:05:56,474 --> 01:05:58,392
In the guise of lady Sita
he is evil Menka.

985
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:00,764
I don't trust him at all.

986
01:06:02,481 --> 01:06:04,464
See, you are leaving that house
today itself.

987
01:06:05,259 --> 01:06:08,294
Arre, how can I just leave that house?

988
01:06:08,354 --> 01:06:11,640
No, I can. But Akriti, they will
really mind it.

989
01:06:12,498 --> 01:06:13,981
He is my childhood friend, so...

990
01:06:14,706 --> 01:06:16,984
All right. Then I will speak myself.

991
01:06:17,252 --> 01:06:18,716
Hey, where are you going?

992
01:06:21,538 --> 01:06:24,228
Akriti is cross with me.
So Bittu is pacifying him.

993
01:06:24,528 --> 01:06:25,967
She so naive.

994
01:06:26,806 --> 01:06:29,177
Why did you she call you "Brother"?
-Did she? Actually...

995
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:32,487
Sis, girls in Delhi call anyone
as brother.

996
01:06:32,547 --> 01:06:34,188
And then I am from Bihar.

997
01:06:36,967 --> 01:06:38,881
Why is Akriti angry with you?
-Angry...

998
01:06:40,827 --> 01:06:41,709
Wrestling.

999
01:06:41,769 --> 01:06:43,718
Her father wants me to be a wrestler.

1000
01:06:44,213 --> 01:06:45,145
I refused.

1001
01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:46,303
Now you tell me.

1002
01:06:46,447 --> 01:06:49,888
If I indulge in wrestling,
what if my bones crack?

1003
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:52,647
Why wrestling?
-Everybody in her home is wrestler.

1004
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:55,292
Even the son-in-law they
want is wrestler.

1005
01:06:59,347 --> 01:07:01,424
What are you discussing?
-About the bone fracture...

1006
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:03,551
Shall we? Come let's go home.

1007
01:07:10,357 --> 01:07:11,727
Akriti told me.

1008
01:07:13,285 --> 01:07:17,121
You are sleeping in a small room
with your friend and his wife.

1009
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,812
As long as you don't find a room,

1010
01:07:21,694 --> 01:07:22,820
continue staying there.

1011
01:07:23,308 --> 01:07:24,134
Yeah.

1012
01:07:25,173 --> 01:07:28,627
Oh, no. Actually Bhanu will
really feel it bad.

1013
01:07:29,002 --> 01:07:31,248
And there is small problem of
sleeping, that I will...

1014
01:07:31,624 --> 01:07:33,420
Uh, I will sleep in the kitchen.

1015
01:07:34,245 --> 01:07:36,298
You think about your friend too?

1016
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,573
Good.

1017
01:07:38,043 --> 01:07:39,388
Escort him in.

1018
01:07:40,433 --> 01:07:41,778
Show him the room.
Go.

1019
01:07:42,147 --> 01:07:42,954
What?

1020
01:07:43,236 --> 01:07:44,274
Come on, go.

1021
01:07:46,502 --> 01:07:48,648
Come in, this is your room.

1022
01:07:56,467 --> 01:07:58,150
Will you sleep in this dress?

1023
01:07:59,077 --> 01:08:00,447
Look, this is my closet.

1024
01:08:01,103 --> 01:08:03,062
Whatever you need take it.

1025
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:04,294
Okay?

1026
01:08:04,589 --> 01:08:05,527
Good night.

1027
01:08:22,113 --> 01:08:23,139
Open.

1028
01:08:23,884 --> 01:08:24,753
What?

1029
01:08:25,091 --> 01:08:26,261
The door.

1030
01:08:27,588 --> 01:08:29,602
It's late at night. Go and sleep.

1031
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:33,167
Sleep?

1032
01:08:59,378 --> 01:09:00,267
Brother.

1033
01:09:02,963 --> 01:09:03,908
Let's go, man.

1034
01:09:04,308 --> 01:09:05,204
Listen.

1035
01:09:05,416 --> 01:09:08,413
You have just returned from night shift.
Again going back to work?

1036
01:09:08,808 --> 01:09:10,303
This way you will fall sick.

1037
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:14,389
Yes, but I have to do the job.
-But will have to rest too.

1038
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:28,773
Sir, his wife has just come
from the village, so...

1039
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:30,143
So?

1040
01:09:31,695 --> 01:09:34,467
Also spare some time
for love to sleep.

1041
01:09:35,412 --> 01:09:37,865
So that you don't feel sleepy
in the office in the morning.

1042
01:09:40,436 --> 01:09:42,138
My wife also goes to her place.

1043
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:45,435
And come back too. But...

1044
01:09:45,879 --> 01:09:46,567
Yeah?

1045
01:10:08,603 --> 01:10:10,780
The factory people make you
work a lot.

1046
01:10:15,617 --> 01:10:16,580
You...

1047
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,396
Don't be so worried about the baby.

1048
01:10:19,778 --> 01:10:22,756
Once it come, it will bring
all the happiness in our lives.

1049
01:10:24,201 --> 01:10:26,735
I have also thought that...
-What's this child, child, child!

1050
01:10:27,536 --> 01:10:28,769
What do you think?

1051
01:10:28,918 --> 01:10:31,370
Can't there be anything else in
a man'a life apart from your child?

1052
01:10:35,905 --> 01:10:36,957
Just....

1053
01:10:40,942 --> 01:10:42,882
You are tired. Take rest.

1054
01:10:55,631 --> 01:10:57,276
Who is he, brother?
-Brother.

1055
01:10:58,722 --> 01:10:59,610
Whose brother?

1056
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:03,402
He is watchman at the factory,
so affectionately I call him brother.

1057
01:11:06,816 --> 01:11:08,236
But he appears to be a wrestler.

1058
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:10,057
That's why he the watchmen.

1059
01:11:11,484 --> 01:11:12,491
I will be back.

1060
01:11:26,837 --> 01:11:28,764
You said you won't go today?

1061
01:11:30,059 --> 01:11:32,211
Can't you see he came to call me.

1062
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:35,034
How come he just came to call you.

1063
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:38,757
They are made you work day night
for two days. You aren't some machine.

1064
01:11:40,541 --> 01:11:42,944
If you can't, I will speak to
that watchman.

1065
01:11:43,331 --> 01:11:44,426
What... hey...

1066
01:11:44,732 --> 01:11:46,740
Who's watchman...
No, I will speak to him.

1067
01:11:46,897 --> 01:11:48,536
I will speak to him this evening.

1068
01:12:02,224 --> 01:12:03,144
Here you go

1069
01:12:04,326 --> 01:12:05,678
Hey, listen... uh...

1070
01:12:07,004 --> 01:12:08,487
I was saying,

1071
01:12:08,868 --> 01:12:10,238
you too sleep here tonight.

1072
01:12:12,015 --> 01:12:13,880
I am afraid of sleeping alone...

1073
01:12:14,186 --> 01:12:16,164
I can't sleep. I couldn't sleep
at all last night.

1074
01:12:18,791 --> 01:12:20,255
Come on, we will have a pillow
between us.

1075
01:12:22,808 --> 01:12:24,159
Oh, God! Come.

1076
01:12:37,637 --> 01:12:38,795
Thief! Thief!

1077
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:41,316
Get up, man. Thief is here.
Open the door quickly.

1078
01:12:41,376 --> 01:12:42,667
What?
-That thief...

1079
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:47,491
What are you doing here?

1080
01:12:47,979 --> 01:12:49,130
Get our of here.

1081
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,179
Nobody is there. I looked.
Must be some cat or something.

1082
01:12:54,298 --> 01:12:56,438
What cat of anything?
I personally saw the thief.

1083
01:12:56,498 --> 01:12:58,402
I saw. Nobody is there.
See for yourself.

1084
01:12:58,953 --> 01:13:00,198
Ram Maruti!

1085
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:02,494
Ram Maruti, come out!

1086
01:13:05,353 --> 01:13:07,731
What happened?
-There was a thief in the house.

1087
01:13:07,791 --> 01:13:09,301
A thief in this house?
-What else.

1088
01:13:09,361 --> 01:13:10,607
How dare he!
-Arre, you come.. -

1089
01:13:10,667 --> 01:13:11,683
Brother Mangal!

1090
01:13:13,887 --> 01:13:17,047
I saw somebody outside
from inside the house.

1091
01:13:18,393 --> 01:13:20,051
Arre... Are you mad?

1092
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:21,622
Ok, then find what you want to.

1093
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,769
What happened?

1094
01:13:25,288 --> 01:13:26,440
What are you up to?

1095
01:13:26,646 --> 01:13:28,842
Brother, there was thief in the house.

1096
01:13:29,224 --> 01:13:30,218
Thief?

1097
01:13:31,719 --> 01:13:33,221
But the doors are closed.

1098
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,743
Must have come from roof.

1099
01:13:35,906 --> 01:13:38,502
Yes. And must have gone
the same way.

1100
01:13:39,729 --> 01:13:40,986
But, when did you come?

1101
01:13:41,387 --> 01:13:42,463
Just now.

1102
01:13:50,872 --> 01:13:52,224
I am going.

1103
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,709
Who else are there in your house?

1104
01:14:02,835 --> 01:14:05,563
Great grandfather, grandfather,
two uncles,

1105
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:06,896
elder uncle's two sons,

1106
01:14:06,956 --> 01:14:09,906
three daughters and their
elder son's one son...

1107
01:14:10,256 --> 01:14:12,408
Not the mouth, move your hands, idiot!

1108
01:14:14,523 --> 01:14:15,593
So, boy.

1109
01:14:16,162 --> 01:14:17,269
Who are there?

1110
01:14:17,869 --> 01:14:19,715
My father and granny.

1111
01:14:20,266 --> 01:14:22,005
Have an elder sister who is married.

1112
01:14:22,743 --> 01:14:24,620
Write a letter to your family.

1113
01:14:25,096 --> 01:14:27,204
On the 18th of this month
everyone has to come.

1114
01:14:28,155 --> 01:14:29,363
It's engagement.

1115
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:30,261
What?

1116
01:14:30,436 --> 01:14:31,343
Yes.

1117
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,193
She is my only daughter.

1118
01:14:34,994 --> 01:14:37,984
I don't care for the world,
so I have given her complete freedom.

1119
01:14:38,573 --> 01:14:39,830
But now

1120
01:14:40,012 --> 01:14:41,795
it's time to bind her in bond.

1121
01:14:43,259 --> 01:14:43,866
Yes.

1122
01:15:06,076 --> 01:15:07,584
You left the motorcycle there itself?

1123
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:09,755
Where your concentration?

1124
01:15:10,356 --> 01:15:11,683
Her father has said,

1125
01:15:12,146 --> 01:15:13,860
engagement is close,
have to do some shopping

1126
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:15,549
Be prepared.

1127
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:24,977
Who was he?

1128
01:15:25,552 --> 01:15:26,985
Is he also from your factory?

1129
01:15:27,742 --> 01:15:28,505
Hmm.

1130
01:15:28,668 --> 01:15:30,657
Had come to return your
mobike from the factory?

1131
01:15:31,146 --> 01:15:32,441
Why? Can't he come?

1132
01:15:32,798 --> 01:15:33,965
Of course he can.

1133
01:15:34,102 --> 01:15:35,985
Where is your watch?
Forgot at the factory?

1134
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:41,687
For day shift you go to factory
this way

1135
01:15:42,464 --> 01:15:44,697
and at night you return
the other way. How?

1136
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:46,174
Look, Reema.

1137
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:49,559
As it is I am so upset.
There is no need to talk nonsense.

1138
01:15:49,766 --> 01:15:50,735
Nonsense?

1139
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,500
I am speaking nonsense. Ok.

1140
01:15:53,769 --> 01:15:55,465
How many brother Akriti has, brother?

1141
01:15:56,472 --> 01:15:57,717
How many?

1142
01:15:58,225 --> 01:15:58,850
Three.

1143
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:00,383
And what direction her house is?

1144
01:16:05,129 --> 01:16:06,631
And is Akriti your fiend?

1145
01:16:07,528 --> 01:16:08,780
Are you having an affair with her?

1146
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:09,684
What drama is this?

1147
01:16:09,744 --> 01:16:10,810
Brother.

1148
01:16:12,787 --> 01:16:13,713
Yes.

1149
01:16:15,121 --> 01:16:16,354
I swear by our child.

1150
01:16:19,457 --> 01:16:20,984
I have to talk to you.

1151
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:24,400
You have to talk?
-Yes.

1152
01:16:24,694 --> 01:16:26,940
All right, I too have to talk,
Come let's talk today.

1153
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,055
What are you doing Bittu? Are you mad?
-Look, brother.

1154
01:16:29,218 --> 01:16:33,404
As much you could take his side
to fool me, I have been fooled enough.

1155
01:16:33,979 --> 01:16:35,662
Now you leave and don't
interfere between us.

1156
01:16:39,596 --> 01:16:41,442
You knew Akriti before our wedding?

1157
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,938
That's why you were sitting glum
in the wedding.

1158
01:16:44,758 --> 01:16:45,741
And that bull?

1159
01:16:45,903 --> 01:16:47,780
Whose engagement he was talking about?
-I don't know.

1160
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:48,894
Don't know?

1161
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:50,990
You such a disgusting man

1162
01:16:51,152 --> 01:16:52,941
that I can't even swear you
on our child.

1163
01:16:53,666 --> 01:16:56,100
Your entrapped  in
that Akriti's tarp so deeply,

1164
01:16:56,282 --> 01:16:58,303
that forget, me you don't even
have any attachment to the child?

1165
01:16:58,363 --> 01:16:59,616
I have no attachment.

1166
01:17:00,273 --> 01:17:03,320
Neither with you nor that child,
because the baby is not mine.

1167
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:14,132
I wasn't sitting glum
during the wedding due to Akriti.

1168
01:17:16,484 --> 01:17:18,955
I was glum because...

1169
01:17:19,961 --> 01:17:21,744
Because I was sterilized.

1170
01:17:23,603 --> 01:17:26,368
And when I was sterilized,
how could that child be mine.

1171
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:31,111
You are your paramour's child on me
and you are saying I am...

1172
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:33,225
Am I a disgusting man?

1173
01:18:28,858 --> 01:18:30,310
What happened, Inder?

1174
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:32,474
Oh, sit. Sit.

1175
01:18:33,269 --> 01:18:34,345
What happened?

1176
01:18:37,624 --> 01:18:38,937
I can't go through this engagement.

1177
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,079
Have you gone mad, boy!

1178
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,600
Hey, Mahavir.

1179
01:18:44,326 --> 01:18:45,246
Sit down.

1180
01:18:53,372 --> 01:18:54,079
Sit.

1181
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:05,166
I am sterilized.

1182
01:19:05,804 --> 01:19:06,642
What?

1183
01:19:09,101 --> 01:19:10,477
I have undergone vasectomy.

1184
01:19:23,408 --> 01:19:25,304
Oh, he has been sterilized!

1185
01:19:35,415 --> 01:19:37,067
So what if you are sterilized?

1186
01:19:37,849 --> 01:19:40,608
If a sterilization can take place
it can be reversed too.

1187
01:19:42,623 --> 01:19:44,543
Don't you worry, boy.
I am here.

1188
01:19:46,884 --> 01:19:48,711
If this is your problem

1189
01:19:49,643 --> 01:19:50,932
I will solve it right away.

1190
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,066
Hey, Mangal. Bring the car.

1191
01:19:54,811 --> 01:19:56,488
Come on get up, boy. Come.

1192
01:19:57,052 --> 01:19:57,652
Come.

1193
01:19:58,253 --> 01:19:59,373
What happened?

1194
01:20:00,311 --> 01:20:02,026
We are taking him to doctor.

1195
01:20:02,732 --> 01:20:04,065
He has been sterilized.

1196
01:20:04,303 --> 01:20:05,310
Sterilization?

1197
01:20:05,804 --> 01:20:07,099
But he is perfectly all right.

1198
01:20:12,911 --> 01:20:15,045
I mean, he appears totally normal.

1199
01:20:15,401 --> 01:20:16,603
Come on move now.

1200
01:20:17,434 --> 01:20:18,522
Come on. Come.

1201
01:20:23,741 --> 01:20:24,617
What happened?

1202
01:20:24,774 --> 01:20:25,944
His sterilization is to be reversed.

1203
01:20:26,525 --> 01:20:27,263
What?

1204
01:20:27,413 --> 01:20:29,497
He has been sterilized,
it is to be reversed.

1205
01:20:30,535 --> 01:20:31,881
Have you lost it?

1206
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:33,776
Mr. Latwal is here.

1207
01:20:40,921 --> 01:20:42,154
So, Doctor.

1208
01:20:43,162 --> 01:20:44,194
Have you heard?

1209
01:20:44,726 --> 01:20:45,815
Now get to work.

1210
01:20:45,978 --> 01:20:48,105
You see, this operation
is very difficult.

1211
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:50,076
It will take just ten minutes.

1212
01:20:50,484 --> 01:20:52,892
You tell me how much will you charge?

1213
01:20:53,043 --> 01:20:55,721
See, it is not the money.
The procedure is complicated.

1214
01:20:56,229 --> 01:20:57,568
I can't do it.

1215
01:20:57,774 --> 01:20:58,944
Look, Doctor.

1216
01:20:59,332 --> 01:21:00,683
Do you see that boy?

1217
01:21:01,603 --> 01:21:03,467
He is to be my son-in-law.

1218
01:21:04,782 --> 01:21:06,928
Now either you open his vein

1219
01:21:07,522 --> 01:21:09,462
or else, in your clinic,

1220
01:21:10,882 --> 01:21:12,634
we will shut your veins.

1221
01:21:13,321 --> 01:21:14,929
Come in. Come.

1222
01:21:15,652 --> 01:21:16,209
Come.

1223
01:21:16,269 --> 01:21:17,842
Bring the boy.
-Come, bro.

1224
01:21:49,914 --> 01:21:51,235
Good news.

1225
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:52,674
I opened it.

1226
01:21:52,734 --> 01:21:54,043
I did nothing.

1227
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:55,932
Vein was already open.

1228
01:21:56,641 --> 01:21:57,379
What?

1229
01:21:58,631 --> 01:22:00,051
What nonsense is this?

1230
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,317
Because he was not
sterilized at all.

1231
01:22:02,377 --> 01:22:03,612
Damn liar!

1232
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:06,578
Were you trying to fool us! You ****!
-Hey, stop, stop.

1233
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:08,276
He is not lying.

1234
01:22:08,908 --> 01:22:09,934
He is telling truth.

1235
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,390
He was sterilized but it was
not done properly.

1236
01:22:12,916 --> 01:22:15,634
Each doctor preforms
100 operations a day.

1237
01:22:15,869 --> 01:22:16,576
So...

1238
01:22:17,302 --> 01:22:19,103
One or two mistakes are made.

1239
01:22:20,486 --> 01:22:22,870
Oh, so it was a nice mistake.

1240
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,188
Hey, Doctor.
You saved my daughter's wedding.

1241
01:22:27,657 --> 01:22:29,215
Say, how do I pay you?

1242
01:22:29,371 --> 01:22:32,162
You just give me fifty rupees.
But I have a request.

1243
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:36,272
If anybody asks you what are you
doing here so late at night,

1244
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:41,609
tell them that all of you had
come here for sterilization.

1245
01:22:43,186 --> 01:22:44,231
So you are back?

1246
01:22:46,783 --> 01:22:47,716
Come in.

1247
01:22:52,809 --> 01:22:53,867
What happened?

1248
01:22:59,684 --> 01:23:00,748
What happened?

1249
01:23:02,568 --> 01:23:03,825
Is everything all right?

1250
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:05,626
Not now.

1251
01:23:06,465 --> 01:23:07,617
We will talk in the morning.

1252
01:24:24,293 --> 01:24:25,882
Where is Inder? Call him.

1253
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:36,250
Here he is.

1254
01:24:37,807 --> 01:24:39,916
You have really glorified
family name?

1255
01:24:40,516 --> 01:24:42,268
The one who doesn't
bother about his child,

1256
01:24:42,328 --> 01:24:44,114
how will he bother about his family?

1257
01:24:44,408 --> 01:24:46,141
Father, it's not like that.

1258
01:24:46,361 --> 01:24:48,263
I am aware that this child
is indeed mine.

1259
01:24:48,323 --> 01:24:49,157
Yeah.

1260
01:24:49,908 --> 01:24:51,059
We too know that.

1261
01:24:51,728 --> 01:24:53,399
You see, how do I tell you, I have...

1262
01:24:53,459 --> 01:24:55,914
I have realized my mistake.
I accept my mistake.

1263
01:24:56,246 --> 01:24:58,323
We will account tor your
right or wrong later,

1264
01:24:58,930 --> 01:25:00,691
first we will take care of
these wrestlers.

1265
01:25:00,909 --> 01:25:02,110
Where is there home?

1266
01:25:02,408 --> 01:25:03,547
Sir. You...

1267
01:25:04,088 --> 01:25:05,712
His friend must know that.

1268
01:25:06,188 --> 01:25:07,952
Come, Mr. Laxman,
show us the Lanka.

1269
01:25:08,997 --> 01:25:11,061
Come on.
-Come on, don't just watch.

1270
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,408
Come.

1271
01:25:13,771 --> 01:25:14,891
Arre... Father...

1272
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,181
Granny!

1273
01:25:17,349 --> 01:25:18,888
Come please. Be careful.

1274
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:22,210
Yeah.
-Hey, massage properly.

1275
01:25:25,325 --> 01:25:26,726
Come on, tighten your hand!

1276
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:31,200
Come on, practice properly.

1277
01:25:31,888 --> 01:25:34,316
He is more prepared than us.

1278
01:25:36,058 --> 01:25:37,606
So what?

1279
01:25:37,806 --> 01:25:40,246
We are from Raghuvani clan.
We don't fear no one.

1280
01:25:40,359 --> 01:25:41,961
What are you watching in them?

1281
01:25:42,021 --> 01:25:43,856
Hey, keep quite.

1282
01:25:44,362 --> 01:25:45,719
When you see your own,
don't fight.

1283
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:47,728
And when you see sturdy man,
don't be afraid. Got that?

1284
01:25:57,689 --> 01:25:59,390
Yes, who are you?

1285
01:26:00,311 --> 01:26:01,875
I am Inder's father.

1286
01:26:02,001 --> 01:26:04,247
Uh, hello, sir. Please come.

1287
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,256
Hey, father!
Inder's father and others are here.

1288
01:26:10,779 --> 01:26:12,374
Good that you came.

1289
01:26:12,593 --> 01:26:14,207
I too felt that...

1290
01:26:14,721 --> 01:26:16,804
It is not good to finalize
engagement date alone.

1291
01:26:18,093 --> 01:26:20,264
But your son didn't inform
that you are coming.

1292
01:26:21,066 --> 01:26:22,880
Inder also didn't inform us
many things.

1293
01:26:23,431 --> 01:26:25,214
Your son is really promising.

1294
01:26:25,274 --> 01:26:27,166
Yes, that's why you've trapped him.

1295
01:26:27,504 --> 01:26:28,567
What?

1296
01:26:31,307 --> 01:26:33,203
It's not sweet enough.
Can I get some sugar?

1297
01:26:33,263 --> 01:26:34,404
Are you attending a wedding?

1298
01:26:34,705 --> 01:26:35,981
Keep the glass over there.

1299
01:26:38,228 --> 01:26:39,504
Come here, come.

1300
01:26:51,341 --> 01:26:52,404
Come.

1301
01:26:53,223 --> 01:26:54,518
She is my daughter.

1302
01:26:54,656 --> 01:26:55,525
Akriti.

1303
01:26:55,888 --> 01:26:58,127
And dear, he is Inder's father.

1304
01:26:59,084 --> 01:27:00,204
Okay, okay.

1305
01:27:01,893 --> 01:27:04,064
Has Inder fallen for this wretch?

1306
01:27:04,124 --> 01:27:06,385
Hey, old women!
What nonsense are you talking?

1307
01:27:07,293 --> 01:27:10,033
Who you called old woman?
You son of a bull!

1308
01:27:10,221 --> 01:27:11,641
Who did you call a bull?

1309
01:27:11,847 --> 01:27:14,024
He is the bull!
And he is the bull's son.

1310
01:27:21,689 --> 01:27:23,297
You, witch!

1311
01:27:23,478 --> 01:27:26,119
Just putting wrapping your head
with shawl, trying to act decent!

1312
01:27:28,397 --> 01:27:30,161
Oh, sir don't hit me!

1313
01:27:30,312 --> 01:27:31,691
Hey, Mangal let it be.

1314
01:27:31,751 --> 01:27:33,878
I haven't taken leave from the factory.
My money will be deducted.

1315
01:27:35,704 --> 01:27:38,426
Do you think if you are wrestler
you will do anything?

1316
01:27:40,877 --> 01:27:42,885
Oh, don't! I am trying to recall....

1317
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:44,568
You called me old woman?

1318
01:27:44,729 --> 01:27:46,275
Calling me old lady!

1319
01:27:46,907 --> 01:27:48,702
Father...!

1320
01:27:48,884 --> 01:27:50,804
Granny, granny...
-What?

1321
01:27:51,167 --> 01:27:53,032
Hey, granny, it's me. Inder.

1322
01:27:54,928 --> 01:27:57,544
You are trying to lure my
brother! My brother?

1323
01:27:57,604 --> 01:27:58,846
She does it.

1324
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:00,992
Yeah, but she is his wife
and you are outsider.

1325
01:28:01,052 --> 01:28:03,125
We are losing and you are
bothered about pay cut?

1326
01:28:03,751 --> 01:28:06,046
What? You too lost it?

1327
01:28:06,215 --> 01:28:07,942
Damn you!
-She is Bittu's wife.

1328
01:28:08,111 --> 01:28:10,475
Yeah, you were having fun
with Inder since so long

1329
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:12,797
and you don't know that
his name is Bittu?

1330
01:28:18,486 --> 01:28:22,859
If I had known that Inder's family
are such a brutes...

1331
01:28:22,919 --> 01:28:24,943
I would have never even
thought of this relationship.

1332
01:28:25,003 --> 01:28:27,351
Father, Inder is married.
-Get away, girl.

1333
01:28:28,284 --> 01:28:30,311
Inder is already married!

1334
01:28:37,033 --> 01:28:38,710
Such a deception?

1335
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:41,938
Actually we have been deceived too.

1336
01:28:43,339 --> 01:28:45,154
Hid his marriage from her.

1337
01:28:45,941 --> 01:28:49,107
And there, to get rid of his
wife and children,

1338
01:28:49,388 --> 01:28:51,159
he narrated a fake story of sterilization!

1339
01:28:52,761 --> 01:28:55,100
He was having fun on the pretext
of sterilization

1340
01:28:55,357 --> 01:28:57,784
and rascal was saying that
I am having affair with Reema!

1341
01:28:57,997 --> 01:28:59,917
This man is factory of deception.

1342
01:29:04,709 --> 01:29:06,530
I didn't want to deceive anyone.

1343
01:29:09,739 --> 01:29:11,835
Instead the baggiest deception
was with me.

1344
01:29:13,506 --> 01:29:14,970
Just two days before the wedding,

1345
01:29:16,015 --> 01:29:17,911
I was forced to undergo sterilization.

1346
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:20,795
I couldn't even tell anyone about it.

1347
01:29:22,052 --> 01:29:23,979
Then everything was going
fine with Reema.

1348
01:29:24,999 --> 01:29:26,976
Suddenly this child popped up
between us and I...

1349
01:29:28,203 --> 01:29:31,919
If I am sterilized, how can the child be
Mine? I was going mad thinking of it.

1350
01:29:35,422 --> 01:29:37,506
During the same time
Akriti came in my life.

1351
01:29:39,490 --> 01:29:40,760
I felt, if...

1352
01:29:41,135 --> 01:29:43,124
If Reema is happy in her life
after deceiving me,

1353
01:29:43,184 --> 01:29:45,270
I too have every right
to be happy in my life.

1354
01:29:45,846 --> 01:29:48,711
And I realized my mistake
when doctor the told me

1355
01:29:48,771 --> 01:29:51,314
that my sterilization
wasn't done properly.

1356
01:29:54,342 --> 01:29:57,627
And before I could do anything
you guys came here and raised hell.

1357
01:30:00,123 --> 01:30:01,762
I did make a mistake.

1358
01:30:03,145 --> 01:30:04,440
Hiding the truth.

1359
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:06,949
But had I not hidden the truth
what else I could do?

1360
01:30:08,989 --> 01:30:10,478
Should have heard people's taunts?

1361
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:12,949
Should have become a laughing stock?

1362
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:15,689
Yes, I am the culprit.

1363
01:30:16,566 --> 01:30:18,005
But what about those

1364
01:30:18,774 --> 01:30:21,909
who forcefully destroyed the lives
of millions in one stroke?

1365
01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:26,588
Who will account for that?

1366
01:30:28,158 --> 01:30:29,760
Who will take its account?

1367
01:30:44,044 --> 01:30:45,546
Reema! Reema!
-Reema! Hey...

1368
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:46,847
Reema...
-Listen.

1369
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,430
Dear Reema, what happened?

1370
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:49,688
Take her to hospital.

1371
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,202
Bring the car out.

1372
01:31:23,344 --> 01:31:24,858
What are you doing here?

1373
01:31:26,303 --> 01:31:27,980
I still have to settle
account with Inder.

1374
01:31:32,716 --> 01:31:35,136
We will take care of Inder later.
Not now.

1375
01:31:41,695 --> 01:31:43,115
Akriti...

1376
01:31:46,587 --> 01:31:47,650
Akriti.

1377
01:31:48,226 --> 01:31:49,702
Whatever I did was...

1378
01:32:03,475 --> 01:32:04,508
The child...

1379
01:32:04,783 --> 01:32:05,790
It has come!

1380
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,524
Congratulations.

1381
01:32:07,674 --> 01:32:09,769
Congratulations to you too.

1382
01:32:11,703 --> 01:32:13,079
Congratulations.

1383
01:32:13,386 --> 01:32:14,424
You have a daughter.

1384
01:32:14,574 --> 01:32:16,264
Both mother and child are fine.

1385
01:32:16,433 --> 01:32:17,778
Thank God.

1386
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,014
Hey.

1387
01:32:22,115 --> 01:32:23,079
You wait.

1388
01:32:33,933 --> 01:32:36,460
'Didn't I tell you that
this story of mine...

1389
01:32:36,873 --> 01:32:42,204
out of 250 million sperms in race
I am the only one who is winner.'

1390
01:32:42,761 --> 01:32:44,625
'By which this girl child is born.'

1391
01:32:47,259 --> 01:32:48,491
Let's go, Akriti.

1392
01:32:55,885 --> 01:32:56,911
Akriti.

1393
01:33:11,726 --> 01:33:12,777
Akriti...

1394
01:33:13,477 --> 01:33:14,804
The mistake I made....

1395
01:33:19,190 --> 01:33:21,730
Father...

1396
01:33:28,657 --> 01:33:31,628
It appears our hero
has fallen in a new jumble.

1397
01:33:32,217 --> 01:33:35,377
Now what to do?
That time itself was full of jumble.

1398
01:33:35,827 --> 01:33:37,481
During the entire duration
of Emergency,

1399
01:33:37,541 --> 01:33:39,953
about a million people
were sterilized.

1400
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:44,506
About 2500 people died due to
carelessness during operation.

1401
01:33:45,187 --> 01:33:48,546
Thank God, our hero
was not one of them.

1402
01:35:37,568 --> 01:35:37,643
End
