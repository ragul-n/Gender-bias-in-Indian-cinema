1
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:37,022
All of you've been informed
about the incidents in the city.

2
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:43,629
You must be aware that this gang war
between Suraj Prasad and Lala...

3
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:48,099
...has been going on
since many years.

4
00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:53,846
On several occasions, we tried
to put an end to their feud.

5
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:59,514
We threatened them, tried to make
them see reason. But to no avail.

6
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:06,753
Their hatred proved to be more
powerful than our efforts.

7
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:11,757
But considering the circumstances
and the adverse press reports...

8
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,399
...it's vital that we find
a solution to this problem.

9
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:23,272
All of you're are among the most
intelligent people in the department.

10
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:30,043
To protect the city and the
respect of the police force...

11
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:39,257
...l request you to find a way
so that they stop quarreling.

12
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,835
We're discussing the same topic.

13
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:56,711
But sir...

14
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:11,753
The minister is sending some
special man to help us out.

15
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,083
The minister says that
you could help us out.

16
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:20,418
People address me as K.D.

17
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:31,600
How can you help us?

18
00:06:32,207 --> 00:06:38,112
Before l state anything, l'd like
to know about the two of them.

19
00:06:39,147 --> 00:06:41,911
Do you have any documents
about them?

20
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:50,952
Where is it?

21
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,631
- Who's he?
- He looks like an idiot.

22
00:08:14,342 --> 00:08:17,140
- The minister has sent him.
- How can he help us?

23
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:30,720
The strategy to stop their fights
is already present in the files.

24
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:35,559
The two enemies can be
made friends very easily.

25
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:39,656
- ls it? How'll that be?
- Let me explain...

26
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:43,234
Suraj Singh has a young son, Rahul.

27
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:46,770
And Lala has a young and beautiful
daughter, Priya.

28
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,543
They're innocent,
attractive children.

29
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:53,410
Now if these children start doing
what they must do in their youth...

30
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:55,182
...the problem will be finished.

31
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:57,043
What does one do during youth?

32
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:00,580
Love!

33
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:04,124
The solution to their sin of hatred
is love between the children.

34
00:09:04,426 --> 00:09:06,360
lf their two children fall in love
with each other...

35
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:09,426
...Lala and Suraj'll have to become
friends. And once they're friends...

36
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:13,895
...the arson, dacoity and violence
will end automatically.

37
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:19,169
How can the children of
two enemies love each other?

38
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:25,337
lf oil and fire are brought in close
contact, flames are inevitable.

39
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:35,216
What we should worry about is bringing
together the fire and oil.

40
00:09:36,124 --> 00:09:37,113
Let me think.

41
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:46,131
My heart is pining for you.

42
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:50,495
Do come now, l've been waiting
for you since a long time.

43
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:57,836
l wish to congratulate you that...

44
00:09:58,246 --> 00:10:03,650
..you've been selected as the most
intelligent and smart boy in city.

45
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:12,486
Millions of people in the
city feel that...

46
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:20,761
...they haven't come across a girl
more beautiful than all.

47
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:27,870
The winning couple of this poll will
be taken to an island...

48
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:38,518
..which beckons people who are in
love as well as those who are not.

49
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,563
How should l explain
how my heart feels?

50
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:34,408
The snake of memories is
biting my heart.

51
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:38,406
Movements echo in my ears.

52
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:41,711
A special person resides
in my eyes.

53
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:46,045
Where should l go
searching for you?

54
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:49,984
There's no destination.
Neither is there a route.

55
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:53,623
My embrace is your destination.

56
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:57,787
Love is the traveler,
and the heart is the route.

57
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,302
lt seems like time has
stopped ticking away.

58
00:17:02,403 --> 00:17:05,839
One second feels like
one whole year.

59
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:11,809
l fear that my dream might
be shattered.

60
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:15,879
Do come lest my hope
is betrayed.

61
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:35,899
Stop!

62
00:17:38,673 --> 00:17:40,504
Stop! You cannot start
this love story.

63
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:41,775
- But why not?
- Because...

64
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:44,601
...the end of this love story
is very frightening.

65
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:48,176
Bullets, dynamite, murder..?
No, it cannot be.

66
00:17:49,117 --> 00:17:53,554
lt can happen. l can overcome any
obstacle to win over Priya.

67
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:56,548
You brought us together.
Now you want to separate us?

68
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,086
The destiny of both of you is
within the control of those...

69
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:03,225
...who believe in hatred.
They don't believe in love.

70
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:06,456
Who are those cruel people?

71
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:08,830
They're your fathers.

72
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:16,503
You're the son of Suraj Singh?

73
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:19,508
- And you..?
- The daughter of Madanlal Malhotra.

74
00:18:19,947 --> 00:18:21,574
And both of them
are sworn enemies!

75
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:29,783
l know that my father is very adamant.
He won't approve our love.

76
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:33,885
l too know that my father would
prefer to shoot me down...

77
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:37,763
...rather than accept the
daughter of his enemy.

78
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:39,457
What'll happen now?

79
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:42,099
l've to inform you with
a heavy heart that...

80
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:45,929
...the title of your book is
'Separation'.

81
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:49,874
No, it cannot be.

82
00:18:52,146 --> 00:18:54,171
- You..?
- Children..

83
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:57,745
- Return to your respective homes.
- But how can...

84
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:27,893
There's only one way by which
you could be united.

85
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:30,733
What is it?

86
00:21:31,672 --> 00:21:33,799
First you'll have to promise me
that you'll do as l say.

87
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:36,871
We promise.

88
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:41,173
Hold your breath, and
watch out for my next move.

89
00:25:57,771 --> 00:26:07,203
You cheat! l should've realized that
you'll set a trap to cheat me.

90
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:12,414
One doesn't have to set traps
to catch dogs, you fool!

91
00:26:13,954 --> 00:26:16,889
They're simply gunned down
in the middle of the street.

92
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:25,422
Rogue! Scoundrel!

93
00:26:30,404 --> 00:26:32,201
l won't spare you alive today.

94
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,468
Stop! What're you doing?

95
00:26:37,077 --> 00:26:40,843
You were talking of showering flowers.
Now you want to shower bullets?

96
00:26:41,315 --> 00:26:44,250
You don't even care for ladies.

97
00:26:44,718 --> 00:26:51,647
You liar! You connived with him to
cheat me? l'll cut you to pieces.

98
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:54,524
What's happening?

99
00:26:55,596 --> 00:27:00,090
How did this clown enter between
us king and queen? Answer me!

100
00:27:00,968 --> 00:27:05,667
The answer is that it has to do
with your son and daughter.

101
00:27:06,006 --> 00:27:10,375
lf you don't embrace each other,
they'll embrace death.

102
00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:12,676
- What're you saying?
- Father...!

103
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:16,713
- She's speaking the truth.
- Yes.

104
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:20,653
lt's a matter of
life and death for us.

105
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:25,721
ln one's life, there comes a time
when relationships don't matter.

106
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:28,922
There are only lovers.

107
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:34,392
A lover who forgets everything
in love of her beloved.

108
00:27:34,702 --> 00:27:40,072
And the beloved who gets everything
in the embrace of her lover.

109
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:45,169
Both of us don't desire anything
else in our love.

110
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:48,346
Neither your love,
nor your hatred.

111
00:27:48,882 --> 00:27:50,850
Neither your friendship,
nor your enmity.

112
00:27:53,354 --> 00:27:55,015
We're leaving, father.

113
00:27:55,923 --> 00:27:58,983
Yes, we're going away...

114
00:27:59,827 --> 00:28:07,825
...to a world where love clouds
shower musical notes.

115
00:28:08,402 --> 00:28:12,532
To a place where the green earth
is dotted with the henna of flowers.

116
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:17,132
Let's go.

117
00:28:17,378 --> 00:28:18,345
Stop!

118
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:23,112
lf you move any further,
l'll shoot you down.

119
00:28:23,384 --> 00:28:28,378
Hey! My son hasn't turned
an orphan yet.

120
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:38,364
Scoundrel! l knew that you and your
son have misguided my daughter.

121
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:40,163
Surround the scoundrels.

122
00:28:42,903 --> 00:28:46,270
These bullets have been fired
only in the sky.

123
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:50,439
But the next bullets will be
targeted at our hearts.

124
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:57,840
lf you want to see us alive,
there's only way out.

125
00:28:58,218 --> 00:29:01,881
You should forget your enmity,
and become friends once again...

126
00:29:02,956 --> 00:29:08,019
...so that we and the citizens
can start living in peace.

127
00:29:08,328 --> 00:29:13,459
lt's impossible that l would
enter truce with him.

128
00:29:14,935 --> 00:29:18,803
lt's impossible that
l befriend this ungrateful wretch.

129
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:24,768
lf that's not possible,
look what can happen.

130
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:28,044
Please count till ten.

131
00:29:29,683 --> 00:29:36,555
lf both of you don't shake hands,
both of us will go to the heavens.

132
00:29:42,296 --> 00:29:42,921
1 ...

133
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:48,862
2...

134
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:57,135
3...

135
00:29:59,313 --> 00:30:01,042
4...

136
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:11,990
Don't do like this. Care for
your father's honor.

137
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:14,020
5...

138
00:30:15,629 --> 00:30:17,358
6...

139
00:30:17,698 --> 00:30:22,965
Did l raise you so that you could
let me down before my enemy?

140
00:30:24,872 --> 00:30:26,840
7...

141
00:30:29,843 --> 00:30:31,470
- 8...
- No!

142
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,907
Please try to understand.

143
00:30:35,849 --> 00:30:37,009
9....

144
00:30:37,284 --> 00:30:38,876
l swear you upon me.

145
00:30:41,054 --> 00:30:42,282
9-and-a-quarter..

146
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,892
- Please save my daughter.
- 9-and-a-half.

147
00:30:47,227 --> 00:30:49,058
Come to your senses!

148
00:30:49,963 --> 00:30:52,124
- 9-and-a-three-fourths!
- That's enough.

149
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:56,330
O Lord! l'm exhausted.

150
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:57,831
We're ready.

151
00:31:00,774 --> 00:31:03,675
- You're ready?
- Yes.

152
00:31:07,214 --> 00:31:10,342
You won't quarrel now?

153
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:12,582
We won't quarrel.

154
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:18,180
You'll maintain peace and harmony?

155
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:21,525
- Absolutely.
- Congratulations.

156
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:35,740
How did it all happen?

157
00:31:39,646 --> 00:31:45,016
My plan has worked.

158
00:31:58,098 --> 00:32:04,298
l've never heard a more ridiculous
episode in my life.

159
00:32:04,938 --> 00:32:05,632
lt's impossible.

160
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:11,077
Everything is impossible
before it becomes possible.

161
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:13,604
And every fact is a dream before.

162
00:32:18,118 --> 00:32:20,518
lt happens only in the stories.
Not in real life.

163
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:27,121
Like you must be knowing...

164
00:32:27,694 --> 00:32:31,960
Lala and Suraj Singh were
good friends once-upon-a-time.

165
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:36,429
But due to some misunderstanding
they became enemies.

166
00:32:37,804 --> 00:32:40,364
lf their children grow fond of
each other....

167
00:32:40,707 --> 00:32:42,265
...the misunderstanding can be
sorted out...

168
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:44,100
...and they can become
friends once again.

169
00:32:44,645 --> 00:32:46,510
Have faith in me.
Give me one opportunity.

170
00:32:46,947 --> 00:32:49,438
l'm confident that
my plan will succeed.

171
00:33:08,468 --> 00:33:13,132
Since we don't have another plan...

172
00:33:13,473 --> 00:33:17,876
...by which we can gain control
over their gangs...

173
00:33:18,712 --> 00:33:26,278
Therefore l'm allowing a time span
of one month.

174
00:33:37,998 --> 00:33:39,488
You should know that...

175
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:45,028
l don't trust your plan even now.

176
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:51,476
Henceforth you'll work in coordination
with lnspector Srivastava...

177
00:33:51,912 --> 00:33:55,575
...so that l continue to get
a correct report.

178
00:33:55,849 --> 00:33:57,476
But sir, l'm good enough
on my own..!

179
00:34:21,174 --> 00:34:27,135
Henceforth you'll assist K. D.
in Operation Pyarana.

180
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,780
l've coined a new word.

181
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,518
To make the elders friends...

182
00:34:34,654 --> 00:34:39,114
...it's necessary that their younger
ones fall in love with each other.

183
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:45,292
You mean that whatever you told
the Commissioner never happened?

184
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,531
lt was a fabrication?

185
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:51,234
lt was a fabricated story.

186
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:53,100
The entire story?

187
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,872
Right from the first meeting
of the boy and the girl....

188
00:34:56,376 --> 00:34:59,470
...till the time when the two
elders reunite once again...

189
00:34:59,913 --> 00:35:02,677
...it was all your
mental creation?

190
00:35:04,017 --> 00:35:05,416
Yes. lt was.

191
00:35:07,654 --> 00:35:11,249
You should've been
a film story writer.

192
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:16,259
l intend to become a film story
writer once Operation Pyarana clicks.

193
00:35:16,696 --> 00:35:18,425
When does Operation Pyarana begin?

194
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:26,170
First we'll have to go and
meet the children...

195
00:35:26,506 --> 00:35:27,768
...who need to be made to
fall in love.

196
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,673
Whom do you wish to see first?
The boy or the girl?

197
00:35:31,378 --> 00:35:33,539
First l would like to meet...

198
00:39:33,386 --> 00:39:38,756
What's beneath the blouse?

199
00:39:41,394 --> 00:39:47,333
Beneath the blouse, it could be
nothing but stolen stuff.

200
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:51,833
But l feel that my son cannot
commit any thefts because...

201
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:55,164
...his father has plenty of wealth.

202
00:39:56,776 --> 00:40:00,143
The pleasure that one gets in
hard-earned money cannot be found...

203
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:04,813
...in father's wealth or
ill-gotten wealth.

204
00:40:06,753 --> 00:40:11,622
So this is your hard-earned wealth?

205
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:19,961
Yes. l earned this money by
risking my life.

206
00:40:20,366 --> 00:40:22,732
Bravo, my son!

207
00:40:23,703 --> 00:40:27,969
So it means that my son has
started gambling now.

208
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:33,774
No, father. l don't gamble.
l just place bets.

209
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:40,319
Look! This is 2000 rupees, earned by
me for jumping from the fourth floor.

210
00:40:40,854 --> 00:40:45,655
And this is 500 rupees for reaching
Bombay from Pune in less than 2 hours.

211
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:53,098
And this 101 rupees is for breaking
the coconut with my head.

212
00:40:54,968 --> 00:40:58,631
- What do you feel about it?
- That's great.

213
00:41:02,642 --> 00:41:04,166
Tell me one thing, son.

214
00:41:06,045 --> 00:41:09,503
What'll you take from me
for losing?

215
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:15,411
There's no question of my losing.
lf you don't believe me...

216
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:18,952
- What if?
- Let's place a bet.

217
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:20,190
All right.

218
00:41:21,961 --> 00:41:27,763
lf you win, l'll give you ten times
the money that you have right now.

219
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:35,603
And if you lose, you'll never
bet anything with anyone. Agreed?

220
00:41:38,578 --> 00:41:41,570
Agreed.

221
00:41:43,983 --> 00:41:44,642
Yes, sir.

222
00:41:45,251 --> 00:41:52,214
Ask Bansi to bring loads of milk
for my son. He'll need it.

223
00:41:52,525 --> 00:41:57,724
No. ln fact, it's your money that
you'll be losing. 26,000 of it.

224
00:42:10,543 --> 00:42:15,242
My dear son, listen to what l say.
Use you second hand too.

225
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:22,013
No, father. Defeating you
is an easy task for me.

226
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,184
Milk, sir.

227
00:42:26,993 --> 00:42:31,054
You need milk much more than l do.
You may drink the milk.

228
00:42:31,397 --> 00:42:35,891
- You know that l don't drink milk.
- l indeed know, father.

229
00:42:36,269 --> 00:42:38,396
But l don't know the reason.

230
00:42:39,706 --> 00:42:45,838
l used to drink milk. l used to
drink it with great relish.

231
00:42:46,212 --> 00:42:50,308
We used to drink equal quantities
through the same glass.

232
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,652
Congratulations.

233
00:43:02,629 --> 00:43:07,657
- ls it a boy or a girl?
- lt's a boy, of course.

234
00:43:08,101 --> 00:43:12,231
- How did you know?
- l've a direct connection with God.

235
00:43:12,772 --> 00:43:15,138
He'd informed me in advance
that it would be a son.

236
00:43:15,508 --> 00:43:19,342
Stop your lecture and have a look
at your son. How beautiful it is.

237
00:43:19,812 --> 00:43:21,973
Thank God it resembles his mother,
not his father.

238
00:43:22,582 --> 00:43:26,211
What's wrong in my face?

239
00:43:26,586 --> 00:43:30,317
Stop arguing now. And at least
hold your son in your arms.

240
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:34,252
No, not in my arms.
Place him in Lala's arms.

241
00:43:35,194 --> 00:43:41,599
As it is, he'd been parading
anxiously all over the place.

242
00:43:41,968 --> 00:43:46,598
You brute!
You should call him Rahul.

243
00:43:47,006 --> 00:43:50,237
Yes. l'd already
thought of his name.

244
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,337
Rahul is indeed a good name.

245
00:43:52,912 --> 00:43:56,848
l've decided; when it's your turn,
l'll call your child, Priya.

246
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:01,150
- Hey! it's a girl's name.
- But naturally....

247
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:04,513
lf a boy is born to me,
and he gets a girl...

248
00:44:04,824 --> 00:44:06,849
...only then can we finalize
an alliance between them.

249
00:44:07,093 --> 00:44:10,426
- Do you agree to it?
- Yes, l do.

250
00:44:10,997 --> 00:44:15,559
That's nice. So let's share a glass
of milk between ourselves.

251
00:44:15,902 --> 00:44:18,200
- Let's share it.
- That's wonderful.

252
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:24,604
All glories to Lord Hanuman.

253
00:44:25,178 --> 00:44:27,169
- Drink it.
- You should drink first.

254
00:44:27,547 --> 00:44:29,674
- You should drink first.
- No, you should.

255
00:44:29,983 --> 00:44:32,281
All right, l'll drink it first.

256
00:44:38,658 --> 00:44:42,458
l wonder who poisoned our milk.

257
00:44:44,097 --> 00:44:51,196
Thereafter l've never touched
a glass of milk.

258
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:57,970
Sir, it's Badal's telephone.

259
00:44:59,379 --> 00:45:04,544
Yes, Badal. What is it?

260
00:45:08,755 --> 00:45:09,744
All right.

261
00:45:12,025 --> 00:45:15,426
That scoundrel's life is too long.

262
00:45:17,563 --> 00:45:21,294
There cannot be a better place
for our business.

263
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:29,965
The water way is open. The land
is open. Even the sky is open.

264
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:34,845
- lt's a useful site. Finalize it.
- All right.

265
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:45,553
Greetings, sir!

266
00:45:45,992 --> 00:45:50,019
May you live long.
The Lalaji has liked the place.

267
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:54,661
lt's the God's blessings that
he has liked the place.

268
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:57,495
But there's a slight hitch.

269
00:45:58,004 --> 00:45:59,972
There's a hitch? Does it have to
do with the government?

270
00:46:00,306 --> 00:46:03,241
- Don't worry. We'll take care.
- lt's nothing to do with government.

271
00:46:03,976 --> 00:46:05,341
Does the hitch pertain to
the municipality?

272
00:46:05,711 --> 00:46:07,770
No.

273
00:46:08,181 --> 00:46:11,082
- With whom is the hitch associated?
- With me?

274
00:46:11,384 --> 00:46:14,285
- Who is it?
- Talk respectfully, you scoundrel.

275
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:19,923
lt's me, who speaks in
a roaring voice.

276
00:46:20,793 --> 00:46:29,565
lt's me, Suraj, the sworn
enemy of Lala.

277
00:46:29,836 --> 00:46:38,039
Before talking big, you'd remember
that l'm more powerful than you.

278
00:46:38,277 --> 00:46:46,548
Don't you forget that the land on
which you stand is ruled by me.

279
00:46:46,853 --> 00:46:49,048
l've overturned many rulers.

280
00:46:50,022 --> 00:46:52,616
l've bought your land.

281
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:58,263
You cannot buy this land.

282
00:46:59,332 --> 00:47:04,429
Why? Have you selected this land
as your memorial?

283
00:47:05,505 --> 00:47:12,240
One who dares to enter my territory
should worry about memorials.

284
00:47:12,612 --> 00:47:17,379
When l enter a territory, that land
becomes mine automatically.

285
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:22,512
One who steps into my territory
without my permission...

286
00:47:23,022 --> 00:47:33,591
...returns not on his feet,
but on his death-bed.

287
00:47:34,233 --> 00:47:34,790
No.

288
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:41,101
- There'll be no firing today.
- Why is that?

289
00:47:42,108 --> 00:47:43,871
Did you get scared so easily?

290
00:47:44,343 --> 00:47:47,938
l've always seen eye-to-eye
with danger and death.

291
00:47:49,115 --> 00:47:52,551
But l don't want to let anyone's
blood flow today...

292
00:47:52,852 --> 00:47:55,412
...since it's my
daughter's birthday.

293
00:47:55,821 --> 00:47:56,810
What?

294
00:47:58,057 --> 00:47:59,581
Your daughter's birthday?

295
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:04,427
- ls it 26th October today?
- Yes, sir.

296
00:48:05,798 --> 00:48:11,964
All right. You may go.

297
00:48:12,405 --> 00:48:17,638
l wouldn't want you to die
on your daughter's birthday.

298
00:48:41,968 --> 00:48:47,600
Friends, the first good news is
that it's Priya's birthday today.

299
00:48:48,107 --> 00:48:52,942
The second good news is that l've
selected the bridegroom for her.

300
00:48:54,614 --> 00:48:58,880
And he's Balbinder, alias Bobby.

301
00:49:03,422 --> 00:49:06,050
Congratulations.
The girl has been engaged.

302
00:49:07,493 --> 00:49:08,755
Where?

303
00:49:09,362 --> 00:49:09,885
Here.

304
00:49:21,207 --> 00:49:24,938
Father has been misguided by his
brother-in-law once again.

305
00:49:25,344 --> 00:49:27,278
He wants me to marry Bobby,
the son of his brother-in-law.

306
00:49:28,147 --> 00:49:29,114
What should l do?

307
00:49:33,452 --> 00:49:39,789
Hey! What's happened? Why did you
walk out of the party?

308
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,154
You didn't even consult me before
finalizing my marriage?

309
00:49:45,831 --> 00:49:47,321
What's there to consult about?

310
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:50,258
How can we find a better suitor
than Bobby?

311
00:49:50,936 --> 00:49:56,431
He's educated in America, he's decent.
Moreover, he's Surendra's son too.

312
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:58,599
l don't like Bobby at all.

313
00:49:59,979 --> 00:50:00,968
What's wrong with him?

314
00:50:03,382 --> 00:50:04,576
l can't say.

315
00:50:09,655 --> 00:50:13,614
l know why you don't like him.

316
00:50:14,827 --> 00:50:19,423
Only because he's the niece
of your step-mother.

317
00:50:20,499 --> 00:50:24,299
l don't want to force anything on you.

318
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:28,707
But you should try out Bobby
for a few days.

319
00:50:29,141 --> 00:50:34,408
And if you don't like him, there're
countless others hankering for you.

320
00:50:40,353 --> 00:50:44,551
You walk very fast. You could
replace P. T. Usha.

321
00:50:45,157 --> 00:50:49,389
After leaving the police force,
l'll have to keep myself occupied.

322
00:50:50,329 --> 00:50:52,160
Why'll you be dismissed
from the police?

323
00:50:52,498 --> 00:50:55,934
Both of us will be dismissed
because your plan has failed.

324
00:50:56,702 --> 00:50:58,431
We'd gone to make the boy
and girl fall in love...

325
00:50:58,904 --> 00:51:01,031
...and the girl got engaged
before our very own eyes.

326
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,964
She's been engaged. She hasn't
been married yet.

327
00:51:03,542 --> 00:51:05,407
- She'll be married soon.
- lt cannot be.

328
00:51:06,112 --> 00:51:09,604
Didn't you notice that when Lala
announced his daughter's marriage...

329
00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:12,142
...the girl had walked out of the
room in a huff.

330
00:51:12,518 --> 00:51:13,951
lt means that the girl doesn't
approve of the boy.

331
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:15,454
So what?

332
00:51:15,888 --> 00:51:21,451
lf a jovial hero enters the life of
our heroine, what'd be the outcome?

333
00:51:23,396 --> 00:51:26,126
You've a sharp eye.

334
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:33,271
l see things of my interest
in a jiffy.

335
00:51:39,745 --> 00:51:42,077
Please come and place your bets.

336
00:51:45,084 --> 00:51:48,053
The handkerchief will slip out
without the glasses moving.

337
00:51:48,387 --> 00:51:50,878
lf any glass moves, your money
will be doubled.

338
00:51:52,591 --> 00:51:53,353
You were wonderful.

339
00:51:53,926 --> 00:51:57,327
200...400..600..1000.

340
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,188
Here's 10,000 from me.

341
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,265
But l hadn't placed such
a heavy bet?

342
00:52:02,568 --> 00:52:03,432
Let's place a bet now.

343
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:06,898
l accept your offer. But remember,
you're likely to lose.

344
00:52:07,573 --> 00:52:11,031
- That's what we want.
- Tell me, what needs to be done?

345
00:52:16,182 --> 00:52:19,083
That's all? l'm as firm as an arrow.

346
00:52:19,585 --> 00:52:22,145
Once l shoot out, l don't return
till l reach my goal.

347
00:52:23,189 --> 00:52:26,317
Whom should l win over? Her?

348
00:52:31,163 --> 00:52:36,863
Not her. Her!

349
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,039
You may consider that you've lost.

350
00:52:46,946 --> 00:52:49,779
Hold the money in your hands.
l'm returning shortly.

351
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:02,053
Bring your ears closer. l want to
tell you something confidential.

352
00:53:05,097 --> 00:53:07,361
Whatever you may want to speak,
speak from where you are.

353
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:12,967
My ears are very sharp.

354
00:53:15,107 --> 00:53:16,438
And me too.

355
00:53:26,852 --> 00:53:30,788
l only want to say that
you're very beautiful.

356
00:53:31,323 --> 00:53:33,883
Any beautiful thing doesn't look
good all by itself.

357
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,657
She has to have a pair.

358
00:53:36,095 --> 00:53:38,859
Even God has made everything
in pairs of two.

359
00:53:39,532 --> 00:53:42,729
Trees sprout two leaves at a time.
There are two river banks.

360
00:53:43,335 --> 00:53:46,395
There're two eyes, two ears
and two lips.

361
00:53:46,805 --> 00:53:50,400
All are in pairs. So why
should you be alone?

362
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:53,539
Because there's only one heart.

363
00:53:55,447 --> 00:54:01,579
What a statement you've made!
l'm floored!

364
00:54:04,857 --> 00:54:08,224
Since we're discussing a heart,
l should tell you that...

365
00:54:08,694 --> 00:54:11,754
...l can only see your face
in the 10,000 rupees.

366
00:54:13,132 --> 00:54:19,002
lf you smile pleasingly, share a cup
of tea and dance with me for a while..

367
00:54:19,438 --> 00:54:21,599
...you could be the owner
of five thousand rupees.

368
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:27,443
Where are you going? Listen to me.
Tell me what you feel about it?

369
00:54:28,981 --> 00:54:34,647
lnstead of knowing my opinion,
you'd better ask his opinion.

370
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,216
- He's my fiancée, Bobby.
- Your fiancée?

371
00:54:39,892 --> 00:54:41,382
To hell with your fiancée.

372
00:54:44,563 --> 00:54:50,968
l was telling her that she should
be accompanied by someone like you.

373
00:55:02,648 --> 00:55:04,275
- lt's raining!
- No, it's a storm.

374
00:55:04,516 --> 00:55:05,073
You baldly!

375
00:55:05,417 --> 00:55:08,545
You sent me to win over a girl who
was accompanied by her fiancée.

376
00:55:10,189 --> 00:55:15,354
Friend, a hunter likes to hunt things
which pose some kind of a danger.

377
00:55:15,861 --> 00:55:21,629
Or else, hunters would've preferred
to kill rats inside their homes.

378
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,992
We're not hunting down tigers...

379
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:25,302
What's the meaning of ducks?

380
00:55:26,238 --> 00:55:28,638
lt's a short form for a bald person.

381
00:55:30,175 --> 00:55:33,235
lf you think that l would feel
offended if you call me a baldly...

382
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:35,738
...it's your misbelief.
One is how he is.

383
00:55:36,081 --> 00:55:41,417
By the way, it's my personal matter.
Here's 20,000 rupees.

384
00:55:46,058 --> 00:55:50,791
You shouldn't be seen with
a boy like Bobby.

385
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:56,199
When one sees him sitting next to you,
he looks like a bug haunting an apple.

386
00:55:57,136 --> 00:56:03,166
lf you were so eager to get engaged,
you should've got engaged to me.

387
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:06,168
You've come back again.

388
00:56:07,346 --> 00:56:12,010
Sit down. Be seated. You won't
sit. All right, keep standing.

389
00:56:13,018 --> 00:56:15,384
Look at both of us attentively.

390
00:56:16,689 --> 00:56:19,954
l'm more handsome than he is.

391
00:56:21,026 --> 00:56:27,261
l'm even dressed more attractively.
He dresses more like a newspaper.

392
00:56:28,834 --> 00:56:33,203
l can even sing better than him.

393
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,137
l wonder if there's any melody
in his voice.

394
00:56:38,277 --> 00:56:42,441
Someone who's walk is so dangerous,
how can he dance?

395
00:56:43,082 --> 00:56:48,349
And when l dance, my feet
don't touch the floor...

396
00:56:48,854 --> 00:56:53,120
...but on the hearts of
pretty young girls.

397
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:04,326
l'm no less in fights. l've a black
belt in kung fu, karate, and boxing.

398
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:07,766
You don't have anything, except
for a long tongue.

399
00:57:08,407 --> 00:57:11,171
l'll cut it short, mind you.

400
00:57:11,443 --> 00:57:12,876
He's amazing.

401
00:57:13,445 --> 00:57:17,575
He's talking of fighting in such
a huge hotel. Shame on him.

402
00:57:18,217 --> 00:57:19,809
- Won't you run away?
- How can you say so?

403
00:57:20,285 --> 00:57:24,779
l run every day. l run for two miles.
l must be running faster than you.

404
00:57:25,324 --> 00:57:27,758
lf you don't believe me,
run along with me.

405
00:57:32,464 --> 00:57:36,457
lf you win in this race, l'll pay
the hotel bills for the breakfast.

406
00:57:37,069 --> 00:57:39,765
- Do you agree?
- lt's agreeable.

407
00:57:43,442 --> 00:57:45,273
But why should l compete
with him in a race?

408
00:57:45,844 --> 00:57:51,214
Simply because it's a matter
of prestige for me.

409
00:57:53,018 --> 00:57:56,579
Whoever completes a round of this
hotel and returns is the winner.

410
00:58:00,793 --> 00:58:03,523
You go from the left.
l'll go from the right.

411
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:19,644
Why should l go from the left?
l'll go from the right instead.

412
00:58:20,312 --> 00:58:22,143
You see, the hotel is round-shaped.

413
00:58:22,548 --> 00:58:25,483
Whether one goes from the left or the
right, it's the same thing.

414
00:58:41,934 --> 00:58:48,134
- You've returned?
- Yes. l didn't intend to compete.

415
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:56,439
l'd placed a bet that l'll drink
a cup of tea with you.

416
00:59:03,689 --> 00:59:04,986
Poor Bobby!

417
00:59:13,498 --> 00:59:16,058
l've won this bet with your help.

418
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:28,576
He's a cheat. He didn't run.

419
00:59:29,514 --> 00:59:31,675
He fooled me.

420
00:59:33,619 --> 00:59:36,850
l've already accepted defeat. Here's
the money for paying the bill.

421
00:59:44,329 --> 00:59:45,125
20,000?

422
00:59:49,835 --> 00:59:52,531
- Why? What for?
- For the bet, sir.

423
00:59:53,138 --> 00:59:57,837
Bet? Do you gamble
with government money?

424
00:59:58,377 --> 01:00:02,837
lt's not gambling. lt's a bet.
Besides, we've little choice.

425
01:00:03,215 --> 01:00:05,945
lf l lose the bet, you would
actually be winning the bet.

426
01:00:10,455 --> 01:00:13,253
K. D. has accepted a bet with Rahul
that he'll win over Priya.

427
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:15,053
Win over?

428
01:00:15,627 --> 01:00:20,189
Yes, Rahul has agreed that
he'll woo the girl.

429
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,193
l won't pay a penny.

430
01:00:26,605 --> 01:00:30,564
Why don't you account for the bullets
wasted on Lala and Suraj?

431
01:00:31,209 --> 01:00:32,141
One bullet costs 65 rupees.

432
01:00:32,511 --> 01:00:36,607
Suppose they shoot 10000 bullets,
it'll amount to 6,50,000.

433
01:00:36,982 --> 01:00:38,882
Even if you subtract 20,000
from 6,50,000...

434
01:00:39,117 --> 01:00:42,086
...the police force still stands
to benefit by 6,20,000 rupees.

435
01:00:42,354 --> 01:00:43,548
ln the process, if Rahul and Priya
fall in love...

436
01:00:43,822 --> 01:00:45,983
...you could be promoted to the
position of a D.l.G.

437
01:01:14,853 --> 01:01:19,415
l was fully hopeful that
you'll understand the situation.

438
01:01:39,378 --> 01:01:45,044
- What're you doing here?
- l'd lost to Bobby that day.

439
01:01:45,417 --> 01:01:47,146
So l'm practicing today.

440
01:01:49,454 --> 01:01:52,514
l've found such a miraculous formula
that you'll be taken by surprise.

441
01:01:53,158 --> 01:01:55,149
When l run, my speed is faster
than that of wind.

442
01:01:55,427 --> 01:01:57,588
lf you don't believe me,
how about a contest?

443
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:01,431
This time around, both of us
will run in the same direction.

444
01:02:02,868 --> 01:02:05,735
You'll ride the horse,
and l'll be on my foot.

445
01:02:06,104 --> 01:02:07,799
You'll compete with a horse?

446
01:02:08,907 --> 01:02:09,805
Place a bet then.

447
01:02:10,575 --> 01:02:12,008
- 10,000!
- No, he's a cheat.

448
01:02:12,444 --> 01:02:13,570
10,000? l agree.

449
01:02:14,479 --> 01:02:15,741
l'll not compete with you.

450
01:02:19,217 --> 01:02:20,377
l agree.

451
01:02:21,586 --> 01:02:23,281
Excuse me for a while.

452
01:02:24,056 --> 01:02:25,614
He's a cheat.
He'll cheat me again.

453
01:02:26,792 --> 01:02:29,056
How'll he cheat you again?

454
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:36,893
- What're you doing?
- Just a minute.

455
01:02:37,536 --> 01:02:39,504
This red chili powder
is an amazing spice.

456
01:02:40,572 --> 01:02:43,040
You may keep this money with you.

457
01:02:46,445 --> 01:02:50,006
This is the magical solution
that makes a person fly.

458
01:02:50,449 --> 01:02:55,284
By applying it, one can run so fast
that even a horse can be overtaken.

459
01:02:55,754 --> 01:02:58,917
What say, Mr. Horse? Come over here.
Here's the starting line.

460
01:03:03,628 --> 01:03:05,596
You start the countdown.

461
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,345
Help!

462
01:03:34,793 --> 01:03:37,523
l've never seen a greater prankster
than you are.

463
01:03:37,963 --> 01:03:40,761
l too have not heard
a more sexier laugh.

464
01:03:41,967 --> 01:03:48,372
But l don't know your name.

465
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:50,700
Tell me the truth.

466
01:03:56,081 --> 01:03:56,740
What do you do?

467
01:03:58,617 --> 01:03:59,208
Love.

468
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:05,554
This is such a job, that there's
little time for anything else.

469
01:04:07,259 --> 01:04:12,458
- You find time to place bets.
- That's my hobby, you see.

470
01:04:12,797 --> 01:04:15,391
You'd placed a bet to
meet me too, didn't you?

471
01:04:15,901 --> 01:04:20,838
Yes. And l won that bet.
But l lost my heart.

472
01:04:22,407 --> 01:04:25,103
How many times have you repeated
this dialogue to girls?

473
01:04:26,278 --> 01:04:30,271
Not many. Only 5 or 6.

474
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:33,748
- Only 5 or 6?
- Yes.

475
01:04:34,619 --> 01:04:38,419
But l'm very serious about you.
l promise that...

476
01:04:39,124 --> 01:04:42,093
...l'll do everything l do
only with you, and none other.

477
01:04:43,128 --> 01:04:48,498
l'm crazy about you much more than
Romeo, Farhad or Majnu could be.

478
01:04:49,501 --> 01:04:51,867
Mr. Crazy, times have changed.

479
01:04:52,671 --> 01:04:55,367
You must've placed many bets.
And you might have won too.

480
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,467
But you'll not win this bet.

481
01:04:58,276 --> 01:05:00,141
- But...
- Never..!

482
01:10:53,665 --> 01:10:55,155
l don't want to listen
to anything.

483
01:10:55,934 --> 01:10:57,697
l agree that l indulge
in undesirable activities.

484
01:10:58,169 --> 01:11:00,797
But my reputation is not bad.
lt's you who's soiling my name.

485
01:11:01,573 --> 01:11:02,904
l cannot tolerate it.

486
01:11:04,409 --> 01:11:08,846
lf you were fond of some other boy,
you should've told us about it.

487
01:11:09,447 --> 01:11:12,883
- Why did you have to hurt your dad?
- l haven't hurt anybody.

488
01:11:14,085 --> 01:11:18,249
Daddy had asked me to see for myself
if l like Bobby's company.

489
01:11:18,656 --> 01:11:21,147
l've tested Bobby adequately.

490
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,221
l don't want to marry Bobby.

491
01:11:24,729 --> 01:11:32,033
lf you have any respect for father,
you should do as we ask you to.

492
01:11:32,503 --> 01:11:34,630
Or else the entire society
will ridicule him...

493
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:39,403
...and comment that he couldn't even
keep his own daughter under check.

494
01:11:39,844 --> 01:11:43,803
What do you mean?
Have l become a vagabond?

495
01:11:44,415 --> 01:11:45,347
But of course.

496
01:11:46,017 --> 01:11:46,881
ln spite of my presence...

497
01:11:47,185 --> 01:11:49,619
if you roam around with another boy,
it's nothing but vagrancy.

498
01:11:50,722 --> 01:11:56,160
lt's enough. l'd taught you to fly.
l'll clip your wings myself.

499
01:11:56,894 --> 01:12:02,855
Ascertain an auspicious moment. l'll
get them married within 48 hours.

500
01:12:06,037 --> 01:12:07,368
Father!

501
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:13,075
l don't regret that Priya is
getting married to that coward.

502
01:12:14,178 --> 01:12:18,274
l do regret that a brave young man
like you lost.

503
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:23,349
What else could he do? She's the
daughter of his father's sworn enemy.

504
01:12:23,955 --> 01:12:27,220
Have you forgotten what Prithviraj
Chauhan did to his enemy?

505
01:12:28,993 --> 01:12:30,722
What did this Mr. Chauhan do?

506
01:12:31,229 --> 01:12:35,131
He'd kidnapped his beloved while her
marriage ceremony was in progress.

507
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,799
What do you mean? Kidnapping?

508
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:43,505
You mean Chauhan kidnapped Samyukta
and made her his wife.

509
01:12:47,412 --> 01:12:51,041
- But didn't anybody stop him?
- What could King Jaichand do?

510
01:12:51,683 --> 01:12:53,082
He couldn't fight with the sword.

511
01:12:53,551 --> 01:12:55,075
lf he were to fire an arrow,
it could've hit Samyukta.

512
01:12:55,853 --> 01:13:00,017
Prithviraj Chauhan galloped on his
horse and sped away with Samyukta.

513
01:13:00,591 --> 01:13:03,185
But Prithviraj Chauhan and...

514
01:13:30,188 --> 01:13:32,520
- Who is it?
- l'm your father.

515
01:13:34,358 --> 01:13:36,485
Go and have a look at your face
in the mirror.

516
01:13:36,861 --> 01:13:39,557
Under the influence of drugs,
everybody calls himself my father.

517
01:13:40,298 --> 01:13:43,096
- ls it so?
- This slap is my fathers!

518
01:13:44,669 --> 01:13:46,500
l'm your father.
Do you understand?

519
01:13:48,339 --> 01:13:51,240
Why're you staring at me?
Get lost from here.

520
01:13:52,443 --> 01:13:55,844
lt's enough. Stop everything.

521
01:13:58,816 --> 01:14:04,448
The bride's family has sent
a set of clothes.

522
01:14:05,189 --> 01:14:08,283
A set of clothes? But Surender
never told me anything about it.

523
01:14:10,261 --> 01:14:16,427
Let them bring the clothes.
Let him fulfill his wishes.

524
01:14:17,535 --> 01:14:19,560
All right.
You may bring it in.

525
01:14:21,005 --> 01:14:22,495
l've arrived at the bar.

526
01:14:24,108 --> 01:14:25,837
You call a splash of water a bar?

527
01:14:26,677 --> 01:14:31,239
From today onwards, there'll be
no drugs, wine or women.

528
01:14:31,582 --> 01:14:35,882
Because you're going to be married.

529
01:14:36,754 --> 01:14:39,848
Such a heavy price for a marriage?
No freedom. l don't want to marry.

530
01:14:40,825 --> 01:14:45,626
lt's not your marriage but my dream
that's going to be realized.

531
01:14:48,332 --> 01:14:50,596
l've worked at it for 15 years.

532
01:14:51,869 --> 01:14:56,203
To gain control over his wealth..

533
01:14:56,641 --> 01:14:58,905
..l engineered a partition between
Lala and his friend.

534
01:14:59,844 --> 01:15:05,407
l removed Lala's wife from the path,
and got my sister married to Lala.

535
01:15:06,450 --> 01:15:14,619
And now, l've made him agree to get
his daughter married to you.

536
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:20,023
- Where are you going?
- To Priya's house.

537
01:15:20,331 --> 01:15:23,528
- Why?
- To congratulate her..

538
01:15:23,868 --> 01:15:26,496
..for being able to finalize
her alliance with me.

539
01:15:26,871 --> 01:15:31,103
You idiot! Don't you know that the
bride and the bridegroom...

540
01:15:31,442 --> 01:15:33,774
...are not supposed to meet each
other one day before marriage.

541
01:15:37,682 --> 01:15:41,015
Control yourself. Change yourself.

542
01:15:44,388 --> 01:15:50,554
Once you're married to Priya, we'll
gain access to so much wealth...

543
01:22:23,821 --> 01:22:25,789
Stop! Or l'll fire.

544
01:22:28,025 --> 01:22:30,220
Think well before you fire.

545
01:22:31,028 --> 01:22:35,021
lf you miss your target, your own
daughter could be killed.

546
01:22:36,567 --> 01:22:41,630
lf you don't miss your target, my
father won't spare you alive.

547
01:22:44,508 --> 01:22:47,568
Didn't l hit you where it hurts?

548
01:23:13,904 --> 01:23:17,203
Come outside.

549
01:23:23,013 --> 01:23:25,811
You're searching for the sun
at midnight?

550
01:23:27,051 --> 01:23:31,249
Looks like the darkness in your
life has increased substantially.

551
01:23:32,656 --> 01:23:34,146
Tell me the reason of your visit.

552
01:23:34,491 --> 01:23:37,051
l've come to correct
one of my mistakes, scoundrel.

553
01:23:37,728 --> 01:23:41,858
l believed that your son is the
progeny of a decent woman...

554
01:23:42,466 --> 01:23:44,263
l expected him to be decent.

555
01:23:44,935 --> 01:23:54,333
But l've realized today that
he's only your son.

556
01:23:55,112 --> 01:23:59,173
His blood too is as wretched
as your own blood is.

557
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:04,043
Bring that devil mouse out
of his hiding.

558
01:24:05,289 --> 01:24:08,918
Or l'll convert this area
into a ruin.

559
01:24:12,663 --> 01:24:16,463
Don't you commit
any foolish act.

560
01:24:17,568 --> 01:24:22,801
By attacking me in my own house,
you cannot get away alive.

561
01:24:24,308 --> 01:24:28,005
Now tell me, what has my son done?

562
01:24:28,645 --> 01:24:33,082
Your son has kidnapped my daughter
from my own house.

563
01:24:34,118 --> 01:24:35,779
Tell me, where is my daughter?

564
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:44,386
lf you're speaking the truth,
l'll punish my son for it.

565
01:24:50,033 --> 01:24:52,866
l promise you...

566
01:24:54,171 --> 01:25:04,240
...that l'll bring back your daughter
to your house within 48 hours.

567
01:25:05,382 --> 01:25:06,406
All right.

568
01:25:07,418 --> 01:25:13,084
But remember that if my daughter isn't
handed over to me within 48 hours...

569
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:18,393
...l'll ensure that you'll grieve for
your son for the rest of your life.

570
01:25:50,294 --> 01:25:51,056
l've won.

571
01:25:51,662 --> 01:25:52,788
l've won.

572
01:25:59,837 --> 01:26:02,101
- How're you?
- l've won.

573
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,375
lt's not you who has won.
lt's me who has won.

574
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:09,879
- Give me the 20,000 rupees.
- Which 20,000 are you referring to?

575
01:26:10,614 --> 01:26:15,278
You'd placed a bet with me to
woo the girl and bring her along.

576
01:26:15,586 --> 01:26:16,712
l've fulfilled the condition.

577
01:26:16,987 --> 01:26:20,855
lf you try to act smart with me,
the consequences would be harmful.

578
01:26:21,959 --> 01:26:24,757
- You must be joking?
- No, l'm not joking.

579
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:29,829
But don't you love Priya?

580
01:26:30,934 --> 01:26:34,893
Love? l conducted this entire drama
to win the bet.

581
01:26:35,339 --> 01:26:39,332
Now you may give me the booty,
and praise my wonderful feat.

582
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:40,736
But don't you love Rahul?

583
01:26:41,345 --> 01:26:44,212
Love? Not at all. l came along with
him because...

584
01:26:44,481 --> 01:26:45,971
...l wanted to avoid
being married to Bobby.

585
01:26:46,383 --> 01:26:49,580
ln reality, l wouldn't care to
even spit on my father's enemy.

586
01:26:50,254 --> 01:26:53,121
But l'm prepared to
spit on my father's enemy.

587
01:26:54,992 --> 01:26:56,789
You shameless creature.

588
01:26:57,427 --> 01:27:00,555
What kind of an indecent act is this?

589
01:27:00,998 --> 01:27:05,128
This isn't an indecent act.
lt's the beginning of the second act.

590
01:27:06,103 --> 01:27:11,871
Henceforth starts the second part
of Operation Pyarana.

591
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:17,171
What's your opinion?

592
01:27:18,849 --> 01:27:23,809
My opinion is very good. l'm glad
that you've chosen a good house.

593
01:27:25,422 --> 01:27:29,882
But l'm sad to inform you that
you'll die in this house itself.

594
01:27:30,727 --> 01:27:32,024
- What?
- Yes.

595
01:27:32,462 --> 01:27:35,954
Therefore l want to know the
kind of death you would prefer.

596
01:27:36,767 --> 01:27:38,530
A peaceful death, naturally.

597
01:27:39,336 --> 01:27:40,997
- You cannot die a peaceful death.
- Why?

598
01:27:41,638 --> 01:27:47,008
Because both our fathers must've
searched you in every gutter.

599
01:27:48,111 --> 01:27:50,944
Yes. lf you're untraceable,
they'll come out of the city...

600
01:27:51,381 --> 01:27:52,973
...and reach here one time
or the other.

601
01:27:53,350 --> 01:28:00,313
You would do well to tell me
about the kind of death you prefer.

602
01:28:00,657 --> 01:28:03,148
You've cooked a delicious meal.

603
01:28:06,797 --> 01:28:10,756
Since you call me your uncle,
let me advise you something.

604
01:28:11,435 --> 01:28:12,959
You should let your intelligence
take a sunbath sometimes...

605
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:14,294
...to prevent it from decaying.

606
01:28:16,306 --> 01:28:18,274
- What do you mean?
- Let me explain.

607
01:28:19,876 --> 01:28:25,815
How'll your father know that K.D.
has a hand behind this development?

608
01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:29,710
You escaped with the girl in
everyone's presence.

609
01:28:30,554 --> 01:28:32,249
They must be searching for you.

610
01:28:35,158 --> 01:28:42,963
A thief is searched everywhere,
but not in one's own place.

611
01:28:44,167 --> 01:28:49,161
For your information, this bungalow
belongs to your father.

612
01:28:49,973 --> 01:28:51,634
- My father?
- Yes, of course.

613
01:28:52,409 --> 01:28:55,469
l've gained control over the bungalow.
The guards've already been bribed.

614
01:28:55,746 --> 01:28:57,839
Your father can never reach here.

615
01:28:58,582 --> 01:29:00,573
My father will definitely come here.

616
01:29:00,984 --> 01:29:02,918
You can bet upon it, if you like.

617
01:29:03,553 --> 01:29:05,316
Let's bet on it.

618
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:12,687
You and your bets. You're responsible
for everything that's happened.

619
01:29:19,002 --> 01:29:20,299
What're you blabbering?

620
01:29:20,671 --> 01:29:23,469
l'll give you a slap and
pull out your teeth.

621
01:29:24,408 --> 01:29:26,069
Have you seen my nails?
l'll pull out your eyes.

622
01:29:26,743 --> 01:29:29,405
Move back, will you?

623
01:29:32,315 --> 01:29:33,304
l won't spare you.

624
01:29:35,152 --> 01:29:42,820
Will you handcuff us?
Where are the keys?

625
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,718
- l don't have the keys.
- Keys, please.

626
01:29:45,162 --> 01:29:46,789
Didn't l tell you that
l don't have the keys?

627
01:29:47,364 --> 01:29:50,663
- What're you doing?
- How can you not give the keys?

628
01:29:51,902 --> 01:29:54,097
Don't you tickle me.
lt's unbearable.

629
01:29:55,872 --> 01:29:58,807
Here are the keys.

630
01:30:00,610 --> 01:30:04,137
And now they'll stay there.

631
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:34,606
What're you thinking?

632
01:30:36,313 --> 01:30:39,612
l'm thinking of burning down
all books of psychology.

633
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:43,075
- Why?
- All calculations have misfired.

634
01:30:43,487 --> 01:30:48,322
A young boy and a young girl
is equal to youthful love.

635
01:30:48,992 --> 01:30:52,723
- lt's all nonsense, and a lie.
- You've lost hope so early.

636
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:55,257
lt's not the question of
losing hope.

637
01:30:56,433 --> 01:30:59,698
l regret that my plan
proved to be incorrect.

638
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:03,735
Your plan might be unusual.
But it's not incorrect.

639
01:31:04,775 --> 01:31:06,037
lt can never happen that...

640
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:08,705
...in spite of being
so close to each other...

641
01:31:09,012 --> 01:31:11,207
...Rahul and Priya could be
so apart from each other.

642
01:31:12,215 --> 01:31:14,615
Cupid has already
fired his arrow.

643
01:31:15,152 --> 01:31:17,382
lt's only a matter of time.

644
01:34:52,736 --> 01:35:01,041
You were right. The arrow fired
by Cupid has struck its target.

645
01:35:01,277 --> 01:35:04,212
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations to both of you.

646
01:35:04,814 --> 01:35:07,840
Congratulations, son.

647
01:35:08,485 --> 01:35:09,349
lt's father?

648
01:35:10,353 --> 01:35:17,054
l could've never imagined that
to enhance my status...

649
01:35:17,861 --> 01:35:24,061
...my son'll bring home the
daughter of my sworn enemy.

650
01:35:26,302 --> 01:35:28,395
lt's not so.

651
01:35:28,938 --> 01:35:29,836
Scoundrel.

652
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:32,337
Whether a daughter is of a friend
or that of an enemy...

653
01:35:32,842 --> 01:35:34,469
...a daughter is a daughter.

654
01:35:35,845 --> 01:35:39,076
And a daughter is not kidnapped
from her father's house...

655
01:35:39,716 --> 01:35:41,775
...but brought home in a proper way.

656
01:35:44,821 --> 01:35:48,848
l haven't brought her here by force.
She has come here by her own will.

657
01:35:51,761 --> 01:35:53,626
Don't misunderstand me.

658
01:35:54,431 --> 01:35:59,733
l ran away from home because l wanted
to escape from Bobby, the fool.

659
01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:04,101
Don't lie. And don't fear the guns.

660
01:36:04,908 --> 01:36:07,809
A brave person is one who can
stand by truth against all odds.

661
01:36:08,344 --> 01:36:11,177
Tell him that both of you
love each other.

662
01:36:11,481 --> 01:36:13,608
- lt was just a facade.
- A facade.

663
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:17,611
Of course! Love happens.
lt cannot be made to happen.

664
01:36:17,921 --> 01:36:19,855
- So both of you...
- Hold on!

665
01:36:20,723 --> 01:36:26,457
Explain to me what's being
discussed for so long?

666
01:36:27,964 --> 01:36:30,626
Who's forcing whom?

667
01:36:31,434 --> 01:36:32,833
l'll explain it to you.

668
01:36:33,369 --> 01:36:36,827
This mad man is
lnspector K. D. Singh.

669
01:36:37,774 --> 01:36:40,902
He devised a plan to make both of us
to fall in love with each other...

670
01:36:41,344 --> 01:36:44,108
...so that you and Lala
will become friends once again.

671
01:36:45,949 --> 01:36:50,682
But how'll this idiot
benefit by our friendship?

672
01:36:52,021 --> 01:36:57,084
Not me, but the entire city and
the nation will benefit.

673
01:36:57,193 --> 01:37:00,924
lf your gang war comes to an end,
many innocent lives'll be saved.

674
01:37:01,664 --> 01:37:07,159
People'll start living in peace
without any fear of violence.

675
01:37:07,704 --> 01:37:11,834
There'll be peace all around.

676
01:37:13,309 --> 01:37:23,378
l wanted to bury in some lake for
having tried to trap Rahul.

677
01:37:24,154 --> 01:37:31,651
But now l think that it would be a
big sin to kill a simpleton like you.

678
01:37:33,396 --> 01:37:34,886
l'm forgiving you.

679
01:37:47,143 --> 01:37:53,013
Lala has cursed me a lot.

680
01:37:53,616 --> 01:38:00,852
But in return, l'll not curse him,
but return his daughter to him.

681
01:38:01,925 --> 01:38:03,358
Come with me.

682
01:38:10,667 --> 01:38:15,036
He promised me a time of 24 hours.
He's a pig, no less.

683
01:38:15,605 --> 01:38:21,271
l knew that his promise
cannot be trusted upon.

684
01:38:32,689 --> 01:38:40,357
When l promise something,
l always fulfill it.

685
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,324
Here's your daughter.

686
01:38:43,099 --> 01:38:46,125
My daughter, l hope you're fine.

687
01:38:46,603 --> 01:38:53,736
Ask your daughter if my son kidnapped
her, or she went away willingly.

688
01:38:58,414 --> 01:38:59,312
Why don't you speak?

689
01:39:01,184 --> 01:39:01,809
Answer me.

690
01:39:04,687 --> 01:39:09,283
l went willingly.

691
01:39:10,727 --> 01:39:11,989
Did you hear?

692
01:39:13,763 --> 01:39:17,756
Before criticizing others, if you'd
checked your own self...

693
01:39:18,501 --> 01:39:22,198
...you wouldn't have had to be
insulted in this manner.

694
01:39:39,055 --> 01:39:44,493
He cursed me today because of you.

695
01:39:45,028 --> 01:39:48,623
He came to my doorstep and
insulted me. All because of you.

696
01:39:49,499 --> 01:39:51,933
lf you were not my own blood,
l would have...

697
01:39:53,469 --> 01:39:55,061
Get lost from here.

698
01:40:01,444 --> 01:40:03,036
You've made me a sick man.

699
01:40:03,713 --> 01:40:08,741
lf l'd known earlier, l wouldn't
have let you enter inside.

700
01:40:09,319 --> 01:40:12,186
l would've kicked you out
right at the entrance.

701
01:40:12,588 --> 01:40:17,321
The entire city is laughing at us.

702
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:20,422
The police department has become
a laughing stock.

703
01:40:20,697 --> 01:40:23,188
All because of one man.

704
01:40:26,436 --> 01:40:32,204
lf l ever sight you anywhere,
l'll kill you.

705
01:40:35,611 --> 01:40:38,011
K. D. didn't have wrong intentions.

706
01:40:39,649 --> 01:40:41,082
l don't want to hear anything.

707
01:40:41,884 --> 01:40:44,978
She's only a kid.
She's not old enough...

708
01:40:45,321 --> 01:40:47,881
...to understand the true
intentions of a crook like Suraj.

709
01:40:48,791 --> 01:40:53,956
lf it were Suraj's trick,
why would he've brought her back?

710
01:40:54,597 --> 01:40:58,226
He's right. Nobody's at fault.

711
01:40:59,068 --> 01:41:04,768
lt's the fault of K. D. Singh, who
forcefully detained our innocent kid.

712
01:41:05,341 --> 01:41:10,540
K. D. will be punished so severely
that he'll remember all his life.

713
01:41:12,949 --> 01:41:21,653
But l'm with you because l believe
that love can be won by love alone.

714
01:41:22,592 --> 01:41:24,355
Don't lose hope.

715
01:41:25,027 --> 01:41:29,623
Only one of your experiences failed.
But your theory hasn't failed.

716
01:41:32,068 --> 01:41:35,526
For a defeated soldier, sympathy
too is a big reward.

717
01:41:36,005 --> 01:41:39,463
This is not your reward. l'll give
you your true reward.

718
01:41:39,809 --> 01:41:41,299
What's this nonsense? Don't you
know that l'm a police officer.

719
01:41:41,711 --> 01:41:44,111
You were a police officer.
Not any more.

720
01:41:48,151 --> 01:41:51,450
This one is for interfering
in other people's affairs.

721
01:41:53,656 --> 01:41:55,385
Stop!

722
01:41:55,792 --> 01:41:57,350
l'm still a police officer.

723
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,742
This one is for instigating
my fiancée against me.

724
01:42:45,508 --> 01:42:45,837
This is for ruining my future plans.

725
01:42:56,319 --> 01:43:00,619
This one is to prevent you
from acting smart again.

726
01:43:13,703 --> 01:43:17,264
lf he survives another 12 hours,
he could be rescued.

727
01:43:17,807 --> 01:43:20,867
- But doctor..
- l cannot assure you anymore.

728
01:43:24,981 --> 01:43:28,644
You scoundrel, if Shalu has made
her statement...

729
01:43:29,185 --> 01:43:32,848
...and the police is waiting for
K. D. to gain consciousness...

730
01:43:33,422 --> 01:43:37,586
..both of us are likely to
be hanged to death.

731
01:43:40,229 --> 01:43:41,560
There's only one way out.

732
01:43:43,099 --> 01:43:45,124
K. D. should be killed
in the hospital itself.

733
01:43:45,434 --> 01:43:47,925
- What're you saying?
- l've heard it myself.

734
01:43:48,271 --> 01:43:49,966
lt's very important to
shift him from here.

735
01:43:50,373 --> 01:43:51,931
- l'll call up police headquarters.
- No.

736
01:43:52,475 --> 01:43:54,705
By the time police arrives,
none of us would be alive.

737
01:43:55,278 --> 01:43:57,178
Let's hurry up.
They must be on their way.

738
01:44:06,455 --> 01:44:08,355
ln which room can we find
lnspector K. D. Singh?

739
01:44:08,858 --> 01:44:09,415
Who're you?

740
01:44:10,626 --> 01:44:14,790
Will you tell me his room number,
or shall l blow you up?

741
01:44:18,167 --> 01:44:20,226
Get back inside.

742
01:44:32,682 --> 01:44:35,242
Get aside. Make way for us.

743
01:44:46,028 --> 01:44:48,861
- Hold this. Go ahead, Rahul.
- All right.

744
01:45:18,628 --> 01:45:20,653
You go that way.
You go here.

745
01:45:24,934 --> 01:45:25,764
That way!

746
01:46:39,208 --> 01:46:40,573
So you thought....

747
01:46:43,946 --> 01:46:48,110
...that you can save him
by fooling me?

748
01:46:58,561 --> 01:46:59,118
Let's go.

749
01:47:41,504 --> 01:47:43,131
A little more. That's all.

750
01:47:49,044 --> 01:47:50,272
You'd better hurry up!

751
01:50:25,668 --> 01:50:27,329
K. D. has gained consciousness.

752
01:50:29,238 --> 01:50:30,899
He wants to speak to
both of you.

753
01:50:37,079 --> 01:50:37,568
Sit down.

754
01:50:41,183 --> 01:50:42,946
l want to discuss
something urgent with you.

755
01:50:47,189 --> 01:50:48,713
Shalu has told me everything.

756
01:50:54,163 --> 01:51:02,400
lf it were not for you, l would've
been in the hospital morgue by now.

757
01:51:03,772 --> 01:51:07,333
l won't spare my uncle and Bobby.
l'll seek revenge from them.

758
01:51:09,945 --> 01:51:12,175
- You'll do nothing of the sort.
- But why?

759
01:51:14,683 --> 01:51:15,741
lt was my mistake.

760
01:51:17,453 --> 01:51:19,944
lt's not necessary that if two young
people are brought together...

761
01:51:20,422 --> 01:51:23,050
...they would fall in love.

762
01:51:27,663 --> 01:51:32,691
lt's not true that if fire and
fuel are kept close to each other...

763
01:51:33,335 --> 01:51:34,495
...flames are inevitable.

764
01:51:36,271 --> 01:51:39,934
lf the quantity of oil is high,
it can extinguish the fire too.

765
01:51:41,944 --> 01:51:44,538
Actually, one cannot make love.

766
01:51:46,915 --> 01:51:49,008
Neither can it be made to happen.

767
01:51:53,322 --> 01:51:57,019
Love happens by itself.

768
01:52:01,363 --> 01:52:06,562
l beg forgiveness from you
for my mistakes.

769
01:52:12,708 --> 01:52:16,872
You'd to suffer many hardships
because of me.

770
01:52:19,581 --> 01:52:21,515
Do me one last favor.

771
01:52:24,787 --> 01:52:28,416
Both of you should go back
to your respective homes.

772
01:52:29,691 --> 01:52:31,955
My best wishes are with you.

773
01:52:34,897 --> 01:52:36,592
May God keep you happy.

774
01:59:22,471 --> 01:59:23,563
So this is the matter.

775
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:30,474
lf you'd told me this a few days
earlier, l'd have jumped with joy.

776
01:59:31,413 --> 01:59:33,506
But now l know the circumstances.

777
01:59:34,282 --> 01:59:36,375
You too should understand
the situation.

778
01:59:37,786 --> 01:59:40,220
lf you marry against the wishes
of your family members..

779
01:59:40,956 --> 01:59:43,254
...the enmity between your fathers
will increase further.

780
01:59:44,759 --> 01:59:48,593
You know very well what the
outcome of their enmity will be.

781
01:59:49,464 --> 01:59:55,164
lf you want to marry, you should
marry with everyone's consent.

782
01:59:55,637 --> 01:59:59,630
- Explain your parents.
- No, they can never understand.

783
02:00:00,275 --> 02:00:02,402
They're enemies who can
never become friends.

784
02:00:03,612 --> 02:00:05,910
But they were friends
before they became enemies.

785
02:00:06,381 --> 02:00:09,441
lf you love each other truly,
you'll emerge victorious.

786
02:00:10,185 --> 02:00:12,119
Your love will overpower
their stubbornness...

787
02:00:12,687 --> 02:00:15,451
...and they'll become friends.
Go home now.

788
02:00:16,024 --> 02:00:19,289
- No, l won't go home.
- And l won't let you stay here.

789
02:00:20,028 --> 02:00:21,928
No, l won't leave this place.

790
02:00:22,998 --> 02:00:24,260
Don't plead to me.
Go away from here.

791
02:00:25,033 --> 02:00:27,433
But at this midnight hour?

792
02:00:27,802 --> 02:00:30,396
- There's no vehicle...
- l won't listen..

793
02:00:32,173 --> 02:00:37,907
- Go away from here.
- Where'll we go at this hour?

794
02:00:38,246 --> 02:00:41,443
Let it be. He has a heart
made of stone.

795
02:01:14,849 --> 02:01:17,113
You! Back here!

796
02:01:20,956 --> 02:01:24,153
We've to live here.
We've die here.

797
02:01:24,759 --> 02:01:28,752
How can we go
without a vehicle?

798
02:01:29,331 --> 02:01:30,263
But what happened?

799
02:01:31,866 --> 02:01:38,965
We fell in love. But
our vehicle doesn't function.

800
02:01:39,874 --> 02:01:41,933
lf it doesn't function,
go walking.

801
02:01:48,917 --> 02:01:50,509
ln the rains...

802
02:01:53,054 --> 02:01:58,856
ln the rains, both of us
met each other.

803
02:02:00,762 --> 02:02:03,993
l'm arranging for a vehicle.

804
02:02:30,492 --> 02:02:32,119
The phone's not functioning.

805
02:02:47,075 --> 02:02:50,511
- What is it?
- Come over here.

806
02:03:08,196 --> 02:03:11,222
They're ruining themselves
before their marriages.

807
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:12,667
There's only one way now.

808
02:03:16,771 --> 02:03:18,033
Come on!

809
02:03:19,074 --> 02:03:21,508
Please don't separate us.

810
02:03:24,112 --> 02:03:25,409
Come upstairs without protesting.

811
02:10:12,653 --> 02:10:14,712
No. Not at all.

812
02:10:15,823 --> 02:10:20,055
l can shoot you dead.
l can see you die.

813
02:10:20,962 --> 02:10:23,863
But l can never see you
marrying into his house.

814
02:10:24,465 --> 02:10:28,993
He's your enemy. lt's your war.
lt's you who hates him.

815
02:10:29,303 --> 02:10:33,262
But l'm talking about my love,
my happiness, my life.

816
02:10:34,275 --> 02:10:37,267
Why do you want me to sacrifice
myself for your sake?

817
02:10:37,645 --> 02:10:39,476
Why do you want me to bury
my love with my own hands?

818
02:10:41,682 --> 02:10:44,879
l'm your son. l've taken birth
in your home.

819
02:10:45,353 --> 02:10:48,083
lf your name is associated with
my name, how am l at fault?

820
02:10:48,523 --> 02:10:51,048
Because he's a scoundrel,
and a thankless creature.

821
02:10:52,426 --> 02:10:59,832
He's so venomous that even a snake
can be befriended, but not him.

822
02:11:00,668 --> 02:11:03,398
l don't want to see your love
being defeated.

823
02:11:03,905 --> 02:11:06,635
At the same time, l don't want
to belittle myself.

824
02:11:07,341 --> 02:11:10,970
l love you a lot. l can do
anything for you.

825
02:11:11,479 --> 02:11:13,379
l can give you anything you want.

826
02:11:15,116 --> 02:11:20,281
But l can't bow down before Lala...

827
02:11:20,721 --> 02:11:23,519
...and ask for his
daughter's hand in marriage.

828
02:11:24,091 --> 02:11:29,893
ln that case, even l cannot accept
that a person who ensures...

829
02:11:30,264 --> 02:11:32,858
..the safe return of his enemy's
daughter, and punish his own son..

830
02:11:33,167 --> 02:11:35,260
...could be a scoundrel and a
thankless creature.

831
02:11:36,137 --> 02:11:39,698
How can it be possible?
Answer me, father.

832
02:11:43,578 --> 02:11:44,943
You shameless girl!

833
02:11:46,380 --> 02:11:49,372
You want to know the truth
about Suraj Singh?

834
02:11:50,451 --> 02:11:51,850
Let me tell you...

835
02:11:52,587 --> 02:11:54,248
He befriended me...

836
02:11:55,289 --> 02:11:58,053
He called your mother his sister.
And then he ensnared her.

837
02:11:58,826 --> 02:12:01,351
He ensnared your mother.

838
02:12:02,363 --> 02:12:08,598
Your shameless mother and that
scoundrel were going steady.

839
02:12:09,170 --> 02:12:12,071
Did you hear? They'd a
relationship between themselves.

840
02:12:13,241 --> 02:12:17,041
That's the reason
why l cannot pardon him at all.

841
02:12:17,645 --> 02:12:23,447
That's why l can poison you,
but can never marry you there.

842
02:12:24,619 --> 02:12:27,850
Do you know now why
that scoundrel is my enemy?

843
02:12:30,758 --> 02:12:32,817
But such a severe enmity cannot take
place for no reason.

844
02:12:33,594 --> 02:12:34,754
There has to be some reason.

845
02:12:36,764 --> 02:12:38,026
l don't know the reason.

846
02:12:39,767 --> 02:12:41,394
l was in Poona during those days.

847
02:12:42,270 --> 02:12:46,070
Sarita, his wife, telephoned me.
She sounded very scared...

848
02:12:46,974 --> 02:12:49,442
...and she called me at the
bungalow in Khandala.

849
02:12:51,545 --> 02:12:54,514
One crore rupees is not worth
more than your daughter's life.

850
02:12:55,583 --> 02:13:01,818
He has told me that if l leak
the news to anybody...

851
02:13:02,089 --> 02:13:03,078
...they will..

852
02:13:03,557 --> 02:13:05,081
Somebody has played some
prank on you.

853
02:13:05,593 --> 02:13:09,029
- Who can play such a prank?
- lt has to be a mischief.

854
02:13:09,997 --> 02:13:19,770
Nobody in the city can dare harm
your daughter in any manner.

855
02:13:20,074 --> 02:13:22,099
But he has warned that Priya...

856
02:13:22,543 --> 02:13:27,003
l promise you that if someone has
really played such a mischief...

857
02:13:27,448 --> 02:13:35,253
...l'll make him bow down
at your feet at all costs.

858
02:13:36,991 --> 02:13:42,725
You two friends don't know anything
besides spilling blood.

859
02:13:44,332 --> 02:13:50,532
Do something. l just want back
my daughter safe and sound.

860
02:13:51,605 --> 02:13:52,970
Have courage.

861
02:13:53,474 --> 02:13:55,669
You'll get back your daughter
safe and sound.

862
02:13:56,344 --> 02:14:01,338
lf anything happens to my daughter,
how'll l answer my husband?

863
02:14:03,718 --> 02:14:05,709
Nothing will happen to
your daughter.

864
02:14:11,025 --> 02:14:20,764
And when l came to my senses, l was
told that l tried to molest Sarita.

865
02:14:21,702 --> 02:14:25,229
And so Sarita fired at me, and
committed suicide thereafter.

866
02:14:27,375 --> 02:14:32,005
l contacted Lala and tried
to explain my position.

867
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:35,405
But Lala was thirsting for my blood.

868
02:14:36,584 --> 02:14:39,610
He was not willing to listen to me
or see my face.

869
02:14:41,722 --> 02:14:48,651
lf it were anyone else other than
Lala, l would've shot him dead.

870
02:14:49,563 --> 02:15:00,167
l remained silent thinking that
perhaps he would realize his mistake.

871
02:15:01,509 --> 02:15:05,536
Perhaps he would ask for forgiveness
from me and embrace me.

872
02:15:08,115 --> 02:15:10,447
But it never happened.

873
02:15:11,285 --> 02:15:14,584
Neither did such a day come,
nor did Lala come.

874
02:15:17,258 --> 02:15:24,096
The ocean of enmity and hatred
did arise between us.

875
02:15:25,232 --> 02:15:26,096
Son....

876
02:15:29,236 --> 02:15:37,735
lt's such a big ocean that one cannot
build any pool on it now.

877
02:15:38,312 --> 02:15:43,579
The love between you and Priya too
cannot bring us together.

878
02:15:47,054 --> 02:15:47,986
Mother...

879
02:15:56,130 --> 02:15:58,724
l know that it's all a lie.

880
02:16:00,100 --> 02:16:01,533
You cannot be like that.

881
02:16:05,139 --> 02:16:07,266
You cannot be like that.

882
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:15,080
Madam, your father is calling you.

883
02:16:16,517 --> 02:16:17,882
Father...

884
02:16:22,323 --> 02:16:23,847
Did you call me?

885
02:16:37,972 --> 02:16:42,932
l told you so many things
without realizing it.

886
02:16:48,816 --> 02:16:53,583
But you too were not
kind to me.

887
02:16:55,422 --> 02:16:59,984
You pierced open
all my old wounds.

888
02:17:04,431 --> 02:17:11,837
Whenever l remember them, my heart
is filled with burning coals.

889
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:15,365
On every coal, only one name
is written.

890
02:17:17,211 --> 02:17:21,841
The name of that traitor
who was known as my friend.

891
02:17:22,816 --> 02:17:26,775
The name of that scoundrel
who was my partner.

892
02:17:28,355 --> 02:17:33,520
The name of that dog who
meant so much to me.

893
02:17:37,998 --> 02:17:40,626
And he robbed me of everything.

894
02:17:57,151 --> 02:18:00,018
My child...

895
02:18:01,188 --> 02:18:03,247
Please don't go to him.

896
02:18:04,024 --> 02:18:06,049
Don't leave me and go.

897
02:18:09,296 --> 02:18:14,233
All right, father.
l'll do as you say.

898
02:18:19,473 --> 02:18:22,670
But you'll have to listen
to my one desire.

899
02:18:24,178 --> 02:18:27,511
You'll not force me to marry Bobby.

900
02:18:31,118 --> 02:18:33,985
All right. l won't force you.

901
02:18:34,755 --> 02:18:36,450
l'll do as you wish.

902
02:19:15,663 --> 02:19:20,623
- Why did you come here?
- l've come to fetch you.

903
02:19:21,001 --> 02:19:21,990
- l cannot come.
- Don't fear.

904
02:19:22,603 --> 02:19:26,334
We'll go and settle down in a place
where there'll be none to hate us.

905
02:19:26,674 --> 02:19:29,074
- There's a reason for hatred.
- Which reason are you talking of?

906
02:19:29,443 --> 02:19:31,308
The one existing between your father
and my father.

907
02:19:31,645 --> 02:19:35,638
Let them fight if they want to.
Why should we ruin our lives?

908
02:19:36,250 --> 02:19:39,219
lf you know that everything's over,
why do you discuss it at all?

909
02:19:39,520 --> 02:19:41,420
- lt's possible that...
- Nothing is possible.

910
02:19:41,889 --> 02:19:42,787
Everything is over now.

911
02:19:44,892 --> 02:19:49,352
So you'll stop loving me?
You'll start hating me?

912
02:19:51,098 --> 02:19:53,225
ln spite of knowing that
l'm not to be blamed.

913
02:19:54,535 --> 02:19:58,027
l know that you're not
at fault.

914
02:19:59,973 --> 02:20:03,534
But l saw tears in my father's eyes
for the first time today.

915
02:20:04,378 --> 02:20:09,816
And if l leave him alone, he'll break
down. He'll die an untimely death.

916
02:20:10,951 --> 02:20:13,442
Will l be able to live without you?

917
02:20:14,254 --> 02:20:16,415
Even l cannot live without you.

918
02:20:18,926 --> 02:20:21,918
You'd better go away from here.
Try to understand me.

919
02:20:22,529 --> 02:20:25,987
There are some decisions in life
which've to be accepted unwillingly.

920
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:27,997
Go away now.

921
02:20:28,802 --> 02:20:33,967
But l'm telling you, if we cannot
marry, l won't marry anyone else.

922
02:20:34,408 --> 02:20:35,670
Go away.

923
02:20:36,677 --> 02:20:40,238
All right. l'd come
to take you with me.

924
02:20:41,014 --> 02:20:45,212
But l'm going with the assurance
that you'll be mine alone.

925
02:20:47,488 --> 02:20:48,284
Promise me!

926
02:21:17,718 --> 02:21:19,185
You're sitting here?

927
02:21:20,187 --> 02:21:24,817
lt's good that you refused
to marry Bobby.

928
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:29,921
l didn't feel offended.
Not at all.

929
02:21:30,798 --> 02:21:35,667
So what if Bobby is my son?
He's no good, after all.

930
02:21:36,837 --> 02:21:40,432
He consumes drugs, he boozes,
he gambles...

931
02:21:40,741 --> 02:21:42,504
l wonder what other vices
he has?

932
02:21:44,945 --> 02:21:48,676
l was thinking that if he were
to marry you...

933
02:21:49,116 --> 02:21:50,242
...you would bring about changes
in his life and improve him.

934
02:21:51,485 --> 02:21:53,783
Moreover, it's a family affair.

935
02:21:54,521 --> 02:21:56,489
The family wealth will remain
within the family.

936
02:21:57,491 --> 02:22:00,255
But if his luck is not favoring
him, what can be done?

937
02:22:02,496 --> 02:22:04,930
- Do you want to say anything else?
- Yes.

938
02:22:06,066 --> 02:22:09,229
When you were away,
l'd prayed to God that...

939
02:22:09,970 --> 02:22:15,533
...if you return safe and sound,
l'll take you to visit the temple.

940
02:22:16,543 --> 02:22:20,206
My promise to God will be
fulfilled today.

941
02:22:24,318 --> 02:22:26,548
Where have you brought me?

942
02:22:27,054 --> 02:22:28,419
l've brought you to the temple.

943
02:22:29,623 --> 02:22:35,220
- But all these people...
- They're all disciples of Goddess.

944
02:22:35,796 --> 02:22:39,163
l've set aside these bodyguards
for her protection.

945
02:22:40,667 --> 02:22:41,258
Do come in.

946
02:22:46,273 --> 02:22:48,798
This is the Goddess whom
you'll address as your mother.

947
02:22:49,576 --> 02:22:50,770
- Mother?
- Yes.

948
02:22:54,414 --> 02:22:57,383
Look whom l've brought here today.

949
02:23:00,354 --> 02:23:01,844
Mother?

950
02:23:14,201 --> 02:23:15,259
Mother!

951
02:23:19,573 --> 02:23:21,973
- My daughter!
- Mother!

952
02:23:26,313 --> 02:23:28,577
- Daughter!
- Mother!

953
02:23:35,722 --> 02:23:40,091
l'd promised her that l'll make
her meet her daughter one day.

954
02:23:40,727 --> 02:23:42,524
l've made you meet her.

955
02:23:46,066 --> 02:23:49,524
- You've grown so big.
- l thought you were...

956
02:23:50,103 --> 02:23:57,874
l know what l've gone through
to keep your mother alive.

957
02:24:01,181 --> 02:24:08,053
How did this devil do a kind act
of making me meet you?

958
02:24:09,056 --> 02:24:11,183
He must be up to some trick.

959
02:24:11,858 --> 02:24:14,759
l've begun to understand his
trick to some degree.

960
02:24:16,096 --> 02:24:19,998
But only l know the entire story.

961
02:24:21,034 --> 02:24:23,628
lt's an old story.

962
02:24:25,572 --> 02:24:30,509
When people used to swear upon Suraj
and Lala's friendship.

963
02:24:31,979 --> 02:24:39,147
l realized that it's not a friendship
but my gateway to progress.

964
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:43,720
And to enter this gate,
l devised a plan.

965
02:24:44,858 --> 02:24:50,023
According to the plan, my sister
came out with you from the house.

966
02:24:50,764 --> 02:24:54,564
And l telephoned your mother
from Lala's office.

967
02:24:59,773 --> 02:25:00,330
Who're you?

968
02:25:01,408 --> 02:25:03,842
How would it matter to know
who l am?

969
02:25:04,478 --> 02:25:07,003
lt's more important for you
to know that...

970
02:25:07,481 --> 02:25:09,972
...your daughter, Priya, is
not at home presently.

971
02:25:10,984 --> 02:25:13,248
What? Priya is not at home?

972
02:25:14,021 --> 02:25:16,854
lf Priya were at home,
she could've met her.

973
02:25:18,425 --> 02:25:21,861
Exactly two minutes later,
l called once again.

974
02:25:22,763 --> 02:25:24,560
Who're you? What do you want?

975
02:25:25,432 --> 02:25:27,400
Only one crore rupees.

976
02:25:28,568 --> 02:25:31,162
Come over to Khandala quickly
with the money.

977
02:25:31,471 --> 02:25:32,563
Keep your mouth sealed.

978
02:25:33,573 --> 02:25:35,803
Thereafter l went to
Lala's secretary.

979
02:25:36,877 --> 02:25:41,143
One mad woman is telephoning
me repeatedly.

980
02:25:42,149 --> 02:25:45,141
She says that she's
Lala's wife speaking.

981
02:25:45,752 --> 02:25:47,879
- She did not call, l hope.
- No.

982
02:25:49,322 --> 02:25:53,349
lf she were to telephone, tell her
that Lala is not in the office.

983
02:25:56,029 --> 02:26:00,398
- Please give the phone to Lala.
- But he's not in the office.

984
02:26:01,168 --> 02:26:08,438
l knew that under such circumstances,
you'd telephone Suraj. And you did.

985
02:26:08,942 --> 02:26:10,933
But what's the problem?

986
02:26:11,778 --> 02:26:14,440
l cannot tell you about it
over the telephone.

987
02:26:15,015 --> 02:26:18,314
l'm leaving Bombay immediately.
Meet me at the Khandala bungalow.

988
02:26:19,453 --> 02:26:20,943
The plan was proceeding smoothly.

989
02:26:22,489 --> 02:26:27,426
Thereafter l went and misguided him
about the illicit relationship...

990
02:26:27,727 --> 02:26:29,991
...between you and Suraj Singh.

991
02:26:30,664 --> 02:26:33,997
- What nonsense is this?
- How should l explain?

992
02:26:35,368 --> 02:26:37,063
lf you don't trust me...

993
02:26:39,539 --> 02:26:42,804
By then, Nisha brought Priya
back home.

994
02:26:49,649 --> 02:26:53,517
- Give the phone to Sarita.
- She's not at home.

995
02:26:54,054 --> 02:26:56,852
- Who are you speaking?
- l'm Nisha speaking.

996
02:26:57,791 --> 02:27:00,487
lt's your father's phone.
Priya wants to speak to you.

997
02:27:04,631 --> 02:27:06,496
- Where's your mummy?
- l don't know.

998
02:27:13,874 --> 02:27:19,972
lf you telephone Suraj, you'll
realize that he's unavailable too.

999
02:27:22,883 --> 02:27:26,683
And when Lala telephoned Poona,
he was informed that...

1000
02:27:27,053 --> 02:27:29,886
...the moment he received a phone
call from Sarita...

1001
02:27:30,357 --> 02:27:33,349
....Suraj Singh left for the
Khandala bungalow.

1002
02:27:33,727 --> 02:27:34,887
- Scoundrel!
- Mother!

1003
02:27:35,462 --> 02:27:37,020
God will never pardon you.

1004
02:27:38,832 --> 02:27:40,891
What's the use of such talk?

1005
02:27:41,701 --> 02:27:43,965
l've already planted
what was needed.

1006
02:27:44,337 --> 02:27:47,101
Now it's time to
reap the harvest.

1007
02:27:48,441 --> 02:27:51,604
- Shall l tell you more?
- Do continue.

1008
02:27:52,846 --> 02:27:55,747
l want to know the depths
to which man can fall down.

1009
02:27:56,216 --> 02:27:59,447
Yes. You should know the depths.

1010
02:28:00,253 --> 02:28:03,086
Because you've to fall down
in such depths.

1011
02:28:05,091 --> 02:28:08,720
The story proceeded thus.

1012
02:28:10,397 --> 02:28:12,865
l took Lala to the bungalow
in Khandala...

1013
02:28:13,867 --> 02:28:21,433
...and showed him how his wife goes
to Khandala to meet his friend.

1014
02:28:47,400 --> 02:28:52,497
My friend and my wife.

1015
02:28:52,973 --> 02:28:53,701
What're you saying?

1016
02:28:55,308 --> 02:28:58,243
l've seen it all
with my own eyes.

1017
02:28:58,812 --> 02:29:01,975
You've insulted my love.

1018
02:29:02,749 --> 02:29:04,148
You're mistaken.

1019
02:29:04,985 --> 02:29:08,443
Perhaps you don't know that
somebody kidnapped Priya...

1020
02:29:08,888 --> 02:29:14,190
...and asked me to reach Khandala
with a ransom amount of one crore.

1021
02:29:14,494 --> 02:29:16,621
l telephoned you at the office,
but you weren't at the office.

1022
02:29:16,997 --> 02:29:19,727
lt's a lie. An absolute lie.
You never telephoned me.

1023
02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:24,163
You telephoned Kamala.
You took Suraj's address.

1024
02:29:24,771 --> 02:29:29,504
You left the driver home, and came
here to make merry with Suraj.

1025
02:29:29,776 --> 02:29:33,268
What's happened to you?
l swear upon our daughter...

1026
02:29:33,546 --> 02:29:35,946
Don't you dare swear upon
our daughter!

1027
02:29:36,216 --> 02:29:38,980
Why don't you try and understand?
Priya's life is in danger now.

1028
02:29:39,319 --> 02:29:40,752
- Priya is at home right now.
- No.

1029
02:29:41,054 --> 02:29:43,386
Yes. l've just spoken to her
before l came here.

1030
02:29:44,124 --> 02:29:46,422
Couldn't you find another excuse
to meet your lover?

1031
02:29:46,993 --> 02:29:50,429
l'll never let you see my
daughter all your life.

1032
02:29:53,667 --> 02:29:57,125
Lala reached Bombay.
Suraj landed in hospital.

1033
02:29:58,305 --> 02:30:06,178
Mother reached here.
And l reached where l wanted to.

1034
02:30:07,814 --> 02:30:12,751
You'll ask why l'd to keep
your mother alive.

1035
02:30:14,020 --> 02:30:15,214
The reply is that...

1036
02:30:16,723 --> 02:30:26,894
...a good gambler always keeps
a trump card under cover.

1037
02:30:27,767 --> 02:30:32,966
Look! She has been
handy, isn't she?

1038
02:30:42,582 --> 02:30:48,350
l accept this spit as a salute
from my daughter-in-law.

1039
02:30:48,755 --> 02:30:50,586
Why're you addressing her
as your daughter-in-law?

1040
02:30:51,291 --> 02:30:57,093
Are you dreaming of marrying Priya
to Bobby, your idiotic son?

1041
02:30:57,664 --> 02:30:59,291
Everything has been finalized.

1042
02:30:59,733 --> 02:31:01,667
l've brought her here so that
she can seek your blessings.

1043
02:31:02,035 --> 02:31:03,593
No, it cannot be.

1044
02:31:04,270 --> 02:31:06,500
Don't let it happen ever?

1045
02:31:08,408 --> 02:31:13,072
lf you don't enter my house
as my daughter-in-law...

1046
02:31:13,380 --> 02:31:15,314
...your mother is sure to come out
of here only on the death-bed?

1047
02:31:15,715 --> 02:31:17,740
l won't let her life get ruined.

1048
02:31:18,284 --> 02:31:20,411
- Scoundrel!
- Pull her chains.

1049
02:31:21,154 --> 02:31:24,146
- Mother!
- Daughter!

1050
02:31:24,891 --> 02:31:27,359
- Leave my mother!
- Leave my daughter!

1051
02:31:29,028 --> 02:31:31,326
Leave me. Mother!

1052
02:31:31,931 --> 02:31:37,096
Leave my mother. l'm willing
to marry Bobby.

1053
02:31:45,345 --> 02:31:47,677
Call that poisonous snake
who has usurped my love.

1054
02:31:49,015 --> 02:31:52,143
Call that ruthless killer
who has murdered my love.

1055
02:31:52,619 --> 02:31:56,578
Call that unfaithful lover
who'd made several promises.

1056
02:31:57,657 --> 02:32:01,457
Call that cheat who promised
that if she couldn't be mine...

1057
02:32:01,861 --> 02:32:03,761
...she wouldn't marry
anybody else.

1058
02:32:05,698 --> 02:32:07,689
He has returned to obstruct
my marriage.

1059
02:32:08,234 --> 02:32:09,895
l'll break his limbs.

1060
02:32:10,837 --> 02:32:14,898
What're you looking at? Lift this
bastard and throw him out.

1061
02:32:15,408 --> 02:32:19,868
Stop! He's my criminal.
l'll punish him.

1062
02:32:20,513 --> 02:32:24,779
What now? Even Priya wants to
punish you now.

1063
02:32:25,418 --> 02:32:28,410
Cheating is instilled within
your blood and family.

1064
02:32:28,922 --> 02:32:32,790
Like father, like son.

1065
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:37,696
Don't scream. l know you perfectly.

1066
02:32:38,431 --> 02:32:45,633
You're a liar. Your love is false.
You played a drama only to win a bet?

1067
02:32:46,105 --> 02:32:50,769
On my part, l played a bigger game
by feigning my love for you.

1068
02:32:51,211 --> 02:32:52,576
Now the account is even.

1069
02:32:54,981 --> 02:33:01,910
Don't take the trouble. You're
accounting for love too?

1070
02:33:03,790 --> 02:33:07,191
lf you still find it hard to believe,
you may ask some astrologer...

1071
02:33:07,594 --> 02:33:10,495
...the details of your misfired luck.
He too will tell you that...

1072
02:33:10,864 --> 02:33:15,062
...Priya is not destined for you.
And if you step in this house again...

1073
02:33:26,513 --> 02:33:28,777
l don't understand what's happening?

1074
02:33:29,282 --> 02:33:30,681
Priya had told me the night before...

1075
02:33:31,217 --> 02:33:33,777
..if she couldn't be mine,
she wouldn't marry anybody else.

1076
02:33:34,587 --> 02:33:37,852
But she insulted me today
in everybody's presence.

1077
02:33:39,459 --> 02:33:41,757
30 hours have passed between
yesterday and today.

1078
02:33:42,161 --> 02:33:43,492
Anything can happen in
such a time span.

1079
02:33:43,863 --> 02:33:46,093
But what changed so drastically
that she began to hate me...

1080
02:33:46,533 --> 02:33:48,797
She's even willing to
marry Bobby now.

1081
02:33:49,402 --> 02:33:51,495
lt's impossible.

1082
02:33:58,811 --> 02:34:01,336
Mother is alive?

1083
02:34:15,428 --> 02:34:19,296
lt means that Priya's
mother is alive.

1084
02:34:19,699 --> 02:34:22,224
You bring along K. D. to my house.
l'll inform father about it.

1085
02:34:22,735 --> 02:34:24,760
This marriage has to stopped
under all circumstances.

1086
02:35:04,477 --> 02:35:06,274
Congratulations to you.

1087
02:35:11,017 --> 02:35:11,779
Come, son.

1088
02:35:19,525 --> 02:35:20,457
Come, daughter.

1089
02:35:35,575 --> 02:35:42,811
You must be surprised upon
seeing me here.

1090
02:35:44,417 --> 02:35:48,547
You must be wondering how l could
come here without being invited?

1091
02:35:50,123 --> 02:35:51,818
What's so surprising about it?

1092
02:35:53,259 --> 02:35:56,422
ln marriages, dogs often happen
to gate-crash inside the venues.

1093
02:35:56,696 --> 02:35:59,563
lt's regrettable that you can no
longer differentiate...

1094
02:35:59,899 --> 02:36:01,230
...between animals
and human beings.

1095
02:36:02,402 --> 02:36:04,996
You've allowed such human beings
to come close to you...

1096
02:36:05,338 --> 02:36:08,501
...who're worst than animals.

1097
02:36:09,108 --> 02:36:15,911
lt's Priya's marriage today.
Don't try to ruin her happiness.

1098
02:36:16,349 --> 02:36:19,546
lf you're so concerned about your
daughter's happiness...

1099
02:36:20,286 --> 02:36:23,881
...why're you marrying her to
this scoundrel's son?

1100
02:36:24,457 --> 02:36:29,952
Stop your nonsense. Priya is marrying
Bobby out of her own free will.

1101
02:36:31,230 --> 02:36:33,698
You've become blind.

1102
02:36:34,667 --> 02:36:37,568
These people have erected such a
strong wall around you that...

1103
02:36:37,970 --> 02:36:39,335
...you cannot see a thing.

1104
02:36:40,206 --> 02:36:45,576
Did you imagine why a girl who hated
Bobby all her life...

1105
02:36:46,679 --> 02:36:49,239
...suddenly agree to marry him?

1106
02:36:50,783 --> 02:36:55,948
lt's due to some pressure
and helplessness.

1107
02:37:01,294 --> 02:37:03,762
Who can force my daughter into it?

1108
02:37:04,731 --> 02:37:09,794
What can be the helplessness that
she cannot even tell me, her father?

1109
02:37:10,503 --> 02:37:14,667
Her helplessness is her mother.
Your wife.

1110
02:37:20,113 --> 02:37:22,638
That woman is dead since many years.

1111
02:37:23,683 --> 02:37:25,810
Don't you try to dig into old wounds.

1112
02:37:27,386 --> 02:37:28,785
Sarita is still alive.

1113
02:37:31,524 --> 02:37:34,459
She is in the captivity of
this scoundrel, Surendra.

1114
02:37:35,661 --> 02:37:40,325
Priya is marrying today because of
this helplessness.

1115
02:37:42,235 --> 02:37:47,969
She has been threatened that they
would kill her mother otherwise.

1116
02:37:48,875 --> 02:37:50,069
He's lying.

1117
02:37:51,077 --> 02:37:56,071
l swear upon you. That swine woman
has been dead since long.

1118
02:37:56,649 --> 02:38:03,077
Beware! lf you criticize her
adversely, l'll skin you alive.

1119
02:38:04,457 --> 02:38:05,185
Brother!

1120
02:38:07,059 --> 02:38:10,392
You'd better make the phone call
urgently.

1121
02:38:11,597 --> 02:38:14,157
lt's you who's a scoundrel.

1122
02:38:14,600 --> 02:38:16,693
You'd made my domestic life unpleasant
on an earlier occasion.

1123
02:38:17,103 --> 02:38:19,094
Now you want to do it again now?

1124
02:38:19,438 --> 02:38:23,772
l didn't ruin your domestic life.
lt was this scoundrel who did it.

1125
02:38:24,377 --> 02:38:27,346
lt was this scoundrel who created
misunderstandings between us.

1126
02:38:27,914 --> 02:38:31,941
He also falsely accused Sarita
of being a immoral woman.

1127
02:38:32,418 --> 02:38:36,115
lt's a lie. He's lying.

1128
02:38:37,590 --> 02:38:43,256
lf you don't believe me, why don't
you ask your daughter about it?

1129
02:38:48,868 --> 02:38:51,962
How would Priya know what is true
and what is not?

1130
02:38:52,905 --> 02:38:56,033
Priya has already had a meeting
with Sarita.

1131
02:39:00,913 --> 02:39:04,405
You don't trust me even now.

1132
02:39:05,318 --> 02:39:07,650
For the sake of your
daughter's happiness...

1133
02:39:08,521 --> 02:39:10,785
...listen to what she says.

1134
02:39:11,657 --> 02:39:15,024
Yes. Do it right away.
Burn her down along with the house.

1135
02:39:19,966 --> 02:39:23,766
You got the number?
Now find out the address.

1136
02:39:30,076 --> 02:39:32,044
Come along!

1137
02:39:32,945 --> 02:39:34,970
Leave me. Where're you taking me?

1138
02:39:36,482 --> 02:39:41,943
- Tie her hands.
- Why're you tying me? Leave me.

1139
02:39:45,091 --> 02:39:47,992
No. lt cannot be.

1140
02:39:48,728 --> 02:39:50,889
Then why don't you
ask your daughter?

1141
02:39:57,103 --> 02:40:01,130
- What is it, K. D?
- We found the address.

1142
02:40:03,175 --> 02:40:03,800
Write down soon.

1143
02:40:22,161 --> 02:40:26,621
ls it true that your
mother is alive?

1144
02:40:28,401 --> 02:40:28,958
Tell me, Priya.

1145
02:40:32,004 --> 02:40:33,335
How you met your mother?

1146
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:46,512
Tell me. Don't fear.
Nothing will happen.

1147
02:40:48,354 --> 02:40:50,083
Tell your father everything.

1148
02:41:03,102 --> 02:41:07,095
No, l don't know anything.
l didn't meet anyone.

1149
02:41:07,540 --> 02:41:09,701
lt's a lie! lt's a lie!

1150
02:41:10,309 --> 02:41:13,369
What're you speaking?
Don't speak like this.

1151
02:41:18,384 --> 02:41:19,817
Take away this scoundrel.

1152
02:41:20,519 --> 02:41:27,891
And hit him as many times as
he has hurt my feelings.

1153
02:41:28,561 --> 02:41:29,084
Take him away.

1154
02:41:30,396 --> 02:41:33,365
For the sake of the mother that
you're trying to protect...

1155
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:38,630
...speak out the truth.
You'll be unharmed.

1156
02:41:40,539 --> 02:41:42,530
Priest, start the marriage.

1157
02:46:22,288 --> 02:46:26,315
- Don't worry.
- What about you, son?

1158
02:46:26,759 --> 02:46:27,953
- l...
- Mother..

1159
02:46:33,899 --> 02:46:34,490
Just a minute.

1160
02:47:17,009 --> 02:47:18,203
Please come.

1161
02:47:20,512 --> 02:47:24,539
May you live long.

1162
02:47:27,419 --> 02:47:28,113
Come.

1163
02:47:40,933 --> 02:47:41,627
That way!

1164
02:47:56,682 --> 02:47:57,478
Mother!

1165
02:47:59,651 --> 02:48:00,242
Mother!

1166
02:48:12,965 --> 02:48:16,696
- My daughter.
- Mother.

1167
02:48:25,744 --> 02:48:33,241
- You're alive?
- Yes.

1168
02:48:35,154 --> 02:48:50,593
lf it had not been for Rahul,
l would've been dead.

1169
02:48:50,869 --> 02:48:53,838
lf it had not been for Rahul,
how would she have come here..

1170
02:48:54,173 --> 02:48:54,901
...to attend the marriage
of her daughter.

1171
02:48:55,974 --> 02:48:57,271
lt's good that you've come.

1172
02:48:57,976 --> 02:49:00,308
Now you may bless your daughter
and your son-in-law.

1173
02:49:00,913 --> 02:49:03,177
Son-in-law? You mean to say that...

1174
02:49:04,216 --> 02:49:15,491
No! l don't accept this marriage.
They forced me to do things.

1175
02:49:18,163 --> 02:49:21,894
lf l cannot belong to Rahul,
l cannot belong to anyone else.

1176
02:49:23,469 --> 02:49:26,336
What're you doing?
Have you gone mad?

1177
02:49:26,839 --> 02:49:29,034
Leave it. Don't do like this.

1178
02:49:29,641 --> 02:49:31,302
l cannot live without you.

1179
02:49:35,314 --> 02:49:39,216
l feel like cutting you
into pieces and...

1180
02:49:39,518 --> 02:49:40,712
...offering your flesh
to crows and eagles.

1181
02:49:41,320 --> 02:49:44,448
But l'm helpless. After all,
l'm the bride's father.

1182
02:49:44,723 --> 02:49:49,183
How much wealth do you desire to free
my daughter from this false binding?

1183
02:49:50,162 --> 02:49:54,690
Your daughter'll have all the
freedom in my house.

1184
02:49:55,234 --> 02:49:56,496
She'll have no restrictions.

1185
02:50:00,472 --> 02:50:02,565
Come on, sir. Take away
your wife.

1186
02:50:04,776 --> 02:50:05,401
Come, Priya.

1187
02:50:06,745 --> 02:50:08,542
When Priya is not willing to
accept this marriage...

1188
02:50:08,981 --> 02:50:10,073
...how can she be your wife?

1189
02:50:10,816 --> 02:50:12,078
Don't you touch her?

1190
02:50:12,818 --> 02:50:16,049
Beware! Nobody should try to
touch Priya.

1191
02:50:16,421 --> 02:50:17,445
No, Rahul!

1192
02:50:19,291 --> 02:50:20,315
No!

1193
02:50:22,694 --> 02:50:26,630
Traditions cannot be broken
so easily.

1194
02:50:27,566 --> 02:50:31,696
Leave her. She belongs to
another man now.

1195
02:50:32,037 --> 02:50:32,696
Absolutely.

1196
02:50:35,173 --> 02:50:36,640
Why're you watching my face?

1197
02:50:37,109 --> 02:50:40,078
Can't you lift your wife
from the marriage hall?

1198
02:50:40,946 --> 02:50:42,675
Nobody should come any closer.

1199
02:50:43,982 --> 02:50:47,918
l won't let Priya go.
Nobody can deprive me of her.

1200
02:50:49,087 --> 02:50:52,614
Try to understand the matter.
lt'll be a sin.

1201
02:50:53,191 --> 02:50:59,687
l don't accept any religion which
prevents two lovers from uniting.

1202
02:51:00,299 --> 02:51:04,429
Religion cannot be altered for
the sake of your happiness.

1203
02:51:05,304 --> 02:51:09,570
l tell you. Leave her hand.
She's a married woman now.

1204
02:51:16,848 --> 02:51:19,146
Leave her. Listen to your father.

1205
02:51:21,219 --> 02:51:25,485
You should be careful about your
parents' reputation. Leave the hand.

1206
02:51:26,158 --> 02:51:27,056
No, Priya.

1207
02:51:44,710 --> 02:51:46,337
Wrong! Totally wrong!

1208
02:51:47,813 --> 02:51:50,611
- What do you mean?
- Greetings.

1209
02:51:51,383 --> 02:51:54,978
l mean to say that this marriage
has never taken place.

1210
02:52:00,258 --> 02:52:03,193
Can a marriage take place
without a priest?

1211
02:52:05,564 --> 02:52:07,862
Who says that the marriage has
taken place without a priest?

1212
02:52:08,433 --> 02:52:13,200
Can't you see that he's a
priest? He recited the hymns.

1213
02:52:13,872 --> 02:52:14,566
He's not a priest.

1214
02:52:19,044 --> 02:52:21,604
What? Where's the real priest?

1215
02:52:22,114 --> 02:52:23,513
He's the real priest.

1216
02:52:24,016 --> 02:52:27,850
He has understood that a forced
marriage is not acceptable.

1217
02:54:15,861 --> 02:54:18,921
Why're you staring?
Summon the doctor.

1218
02:54:19,364 --> 02:54:22,697
lt's an ordinary wound.
l'll be fine.

1219
02:54:22,968 --> 02:54:24,435
Why did you do it?

1220
02:54:26,271 --> 02:54:29,069
l only repaid the debt
of blood.

1221
02:54:29,775 --> 02:54:32,972
- Debt of blood?
- Yes.

1222
02:54:34,112 --> 02:54:38,310
You may not know that it was me
who'd fired at you in Khandala.

1223
02:54:39,017 --> 02:54:40,450
l'd made your blood flow out.

1224
02:54:42,320 --> 02:54:43,651
Now the account is clear.

1225
02:54:44,356 --> 02:54:51,785
Friendship doesn't care for accounts.
A Friendship is unlimited.

1226
02:55:03,041 --> 02:55:03,871
l'm here! .

1227
02:55:05,510 --> 02:55:08,809
Congratulations! Operation Pyarana
has been successful.

1228
02:55:10,482 --> 02:55:20,221
You may join the duty from tomorrow.

1229
02:55:26,798 --> 02:55:30,359
Now you'll drink milk, l suppose.
lt is free of all poisons now.

1230
02:55:30,936 --> 02:55:35,168
l'll definitely drink milk now.
How about it? Like in old times.

1231
02:55:35,507 --> 02:55:38,635
- One sip each in turns.
- Give it to me.

1232
02:55:40,312 --> 02:55:41,506
That's wonderful.

1233
02:55:42,848 --> 02:55:44,975
Bravo, my friend.

1234
02:55:47,819 --> 02:55:51,778
What do you feel? Will my father
drink the last sip, or yours?

1235
02:55:52,490 --> 02:55:53,957
- My father.
- Do you bet on it?

1236
02:55:54,626 --> 02:55:56,958
- Yes. l bet on it.
- All right.

1237
02:55:57,195 --> 02:55:58,958
lf l lose, l'll marry you.
