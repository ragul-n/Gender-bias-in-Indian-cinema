2
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,370
'I am not a perceived reality.'

3
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,410
'Don-Don-Don.'

4
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:07,200
'Our love...'

5
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,000
- 'Why don't you understand?'
- 'Why don't you understand, Doctor.'

6
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,450
'You stupid clown.'

7
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,200
'You are looking right at him.'

8
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,830
'In my city of dreams...'

9
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,500
'You wouldn't know trust.'

10
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,700
'Go on Simran.'

11
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,660
'Go on and embrace your life.'

12
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,540
No Kumar, I am scared.

13
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,750
- Scared?
- Yes.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,620
This is no time to be scared, Neha.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,450
Because we no longer have that luxury.

16
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,330
It's either us...

17
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,500
...or this Anti-Romeo Squad.

18
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,200
Cut. Cut-Cut!

19
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,000
'My-My-My...'

20
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,870
'Pink stole bundled
with matching a suit.'

21
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,410
'So cute.'

22
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,870
'With the wind under our feet...'

23
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,200
'...off we go sailing over
every hurdle that comes our way.'

24
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,910
'With the wind under our feet...'

25
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,410
'...off we go sailing over
every hurdle that comes our way.'

26
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,040
Turn. Turn.
Push him. Push him down.

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,330
- And now you.
- Are you crazy?

28
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,910
- He's was manhandling me.
- I quit.

29
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,540
"Whatever we do...

30
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,330
- We do it under the broad daylight."
- "...under the broad daylight."

31
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,950
"Whatever we do...

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,660
- We do it under the broad daylight."
- "...under the broad daylight."

33
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,250
"Whatever we do...

34
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,950
- We do it under the broad daylight."
- "...under the broad daylight."

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,410
"Whatever we do...

36
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,870
- We do it under the broad daylight."
- "...under the broad daylight."

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
What's going on here?

38
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,700
Coochie-coo...lovey-dovey, huh...

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,620
Haven't you heard about
the Anti Romeo Squad?

40
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,250
Cut.

41
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,160
"We're the News channel,
and the newspaper here."

42
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:58,000
"Guys, we're the leaders of the
next generation."

43
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,410
"We're the upcoming stars."

44
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,200
"We are completely unhinged..."

45
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,870
"...and yet we dream
about touching the sky."

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,620
"Whatever we do...

47
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,040
- We do it under the broad daylight."
- We need the vehicle for a day.

48
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,870
And what about the money
that you already owe me?

49
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,200
I'll pay you in full.

50
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,330
Son, looking at what you're doing...

51
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,000
...will you ever have enough
to pay me back?

52
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,080
And no one's ever going
to say yes to marry you.

53
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,750
So even dowry is out of the question.

54
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,580
So why make such films
in the first place.

55
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,290
Look, aunty,
we got 500,000 likes on our Video.

56
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,080
- What do you think you're doing?
- Aunty...

57
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,540
...we're also getting advertisements
on our Youtube Channel.

58
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,040
We've also been invited
to the Jabalpur Film Festival.

59
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,830
Mom, tell the driver
to get the vehicle.

60
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,750
Banwari.

61
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,950
Give Annu the keys.

62
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,700
Great.

63
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,500
Of course, of course.

64
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,080
Such a wise-guy.

65
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,410
'Where is he?'

66
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,330
'Who'

67
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,700
'The Emperor who controls even the life
that's been bestowed by God himself.'

68
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,330
'Watch your tone, Salim.'

69
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,330
'Salim's Anarkali shall not die
in a cruel Emperor's captivity.'

70
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,080
'I want his seal on this order
of her release.'

71
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,450
- 'Anarkali cannot be set free.'
- 'And why not?'

72
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,700
'Quiet. '

73
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,660
'A Prince should not
forget his priorities.'

74
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,290
'What priority can
be above even love?'

75
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,750
Very good. Very good.
- The emperor's orders is your duty.

76
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,160
This cannot be my duty.

77
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,120
In the entire film industry of Allahabad.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
Look here,

79
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,660
What a beautiful shot
covering everything.

80
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,250
No one can do it.

81
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,500
- That's Kurban's uncle.
- Does he even look like an uncle?

82
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,160
Hey you...

83
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,200
Listen carefully, you're never
giving any role to my uncle again.

84
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,000
He's made a mess.

85
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,870
I am missing Mughal-e-Azam
so I can clean up his mess.

86
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,450
No way anyone can make the neighborhood
kids perform the way I made them.

87
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,540
Who knows films better than Usman.

88
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,500
- How long has it been?
- Listen...

89
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,830
Oh no...not a power cut now.

90
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,660
- Didn't you fix the generator?
- This show was on popular public demand...

91
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,450
Where's the bottle?

92
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,540
...now they will tear up the seats.
Understand.

93
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,250
Where do you think you are going?

94
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,500
- Hey...
- Coming.

95
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,660
Salim.

96
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,580
Anarkali is not fit for you.

97
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,540
And why not?

98
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,500
Take me in your arms like you
always did with your favorite son.

99
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,750
What else...

100
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,540
It's not your cup of tea
Sit down.

101
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,160
Shower me with that same love
that you always did.

102
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,410
Treat me like your son,
and not the Crown Prince of India.

103
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,160
Is Anarkali still unfit for me?

104
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,120
What a statement?

105
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,910
No doubt I am a father
that loves his son.

106
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,580
But I cannot ignore my
priorities as the Emperor.

107
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,200
Wonderful.

108
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,080
I cannot toy with the fate of India...

109
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,410
...for the sake of my son's love.

110
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,000
Nothing stays constant,
whether its fate,...

111
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,620
...time, kingdoms, or Emperor.

112
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,290
But a person blessed
by love is the only one...

113
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,290
...that stays constant
in this ever-changing world.

114
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,040
Wow...

115
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,700
You will have to change.

116
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,540
Fantastic. Fantastic. Amazing.

117
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,200
Salim, you will have to change.

118
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,950
- How much do you have?
- 55 rupees.

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,330
Of course, Vishal Bhargav,

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,040
Request his father to lend us
his Mercedes for a couple of hours.

121
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,580
He won't entertain
us until we don't pay him.

122
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,080
I have already tried.
The rate is 3000.

123
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,700
And we are fresh out of money.

124
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,870
We can only resume shooting
when we get more money.

125
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,540
No need to worry.

126
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,290
The University has
announced the exam dates.

127
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,000
Now that's some good news.
Go on then.

128
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,330
Call all the restless students
who want to pass the exam.

129
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,950
- And call them directly to the office.
- But this time let's raise the rate.

130
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,450
- English will cost you extra.
- Why?

131
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,830
- Because English is expensive.
- I see...

132
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,500
When you pass with merit,
you'll also get a job instantly.

133
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, what's up with you?

134
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,200
I want to pass Botany with merit.

135
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,200
I want to prepare for MB.

136
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,080
Consider it done.

137
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,790
But first, we'll require some advance.
10,000 each.

138
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,080
- But that's too much.
- Really?

139
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,040
See this guy.

140
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,290
Even he didn't have 10,000 to give us...

141
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,410
...and he's still selling tea.

142
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,250
The rest is for them.

143
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,370
I think you should apply
for Polytechnic instead.

144
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,540
I'll need some advance right now, Anu.

145
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,660
Otherwise, you can find someone else.

146
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,080
Phatu, come hither.

147
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,500
Got some money?

148
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,330
Come here.

149
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,870
5000 now,
And 5000 when the job's done.

150
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

151
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,910
Here you go.

152
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,540
I still have to meet up
with the Botany and Maths teacher.

153
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,950
You're charging extra for English...

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
...but everyone else is still working for
the same rate as they did three years ago.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,910
Understood.

156
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,910
Show some love for your country.

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,580
We'll get you 45%.

158
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,910
Boss...here I am.

159
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,200
Here comes the hero.

160
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,620
So the hero, which is me...

161
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,660
- ...is making love to his heroine.
- Yeah...

162
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,950
And the villain is watching everything
from outside the window.

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,620
What exactly are we making?

164
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,370
Hey...out of the way!

165
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,330
- Watch where you are going!
- Boss...

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,200
You're so thrilled to hear the scene.

167
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,250
Are you okay?

168
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,120
Imagine the public's reaction.

169
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,450
You know what, Maithili...

170
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,410
...I'm even scared to
hand him a glass of water...

171
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,080
...because he's just
waiting to pounce on me.

172
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,580
What...

173
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,000
Mind your own business!

174
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,330
I am too young right now.

175
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,540
It's not my age to have kids.

176
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,950
There is no cure for a man's lust.

177
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,160
- Listen, lower your hands.
- No.

178
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,450
Listen, lower your hands.
I promise I won't do anything.

179
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,080
No, no. Move.

180
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,410
What are you doing?
Let me go.

181
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,660
- Let me go.
- What happened?

182
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,580
Stay back.

183
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,700
- You're scared of even my touch.
- Yes, I am.

184
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,750
Don't you trust me?

185
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,580
- You don't?
- No

186
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,370
- You don't?
- No

187
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,250
I am leaving then.

188
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,870
- Should I ?
- But I do trust you.

189
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,870
But not your intentions.

190
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,330
What if we go too far?

191
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,330
We'll be getting married, Kusum.

192
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,200
Wait a minute.

193
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Swear on this Holy water of Ganga.

194
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,660
- Okay.
- Yes.

195
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,540
You have no dearth of females.

196
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,540
You're such a leach.

197
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,330
What do you do when you're acting.

198
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,620
Don't you feel anything
when you touch them?

199
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,910
For a fact, I am a man.

200
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,910
I do feel something.

201
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,790
That's why I keep it strapped down.

202
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,750
Do what?

203
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,370
Strap it down.

204
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,750
Strap it down.
What do you mean?

205
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,040
What on earth are you doing?
Someone might see us.

206
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,000
- Look here.
- Not a chance.

207
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,620
- I am doing this for you.
- No.

208
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,750
- Take a look.
- This is too embarrassing.

209
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,160
No.

210
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,580
Look at all the effort
I take only for you.

211
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,750
Even you can do something
for me in return.

212
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,040
- Stop resisting me.
- Stay back.

213
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,330
Don't come any closer.

214
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,950
No, no, let me go.

215
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,330
- Someone might see us.
- He's in that boat.

216
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,450
What happened?

217
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,660
There he is.

218
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,410
How dare you?

219
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,040
And with one of our own.

220
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,450
Please let me go. Let me go.

221
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,830
I haven't done anything.
Please...just let me go.

222
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,660
She is my student.

223
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,950
Thank God we arrived
in the nick of time.

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,330
Or else he would've tainted her.

225
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,830
Kusum is safe.

226
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,040
Let's cure this problem from the root.

227
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,540
I haven't done anything.

228
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,330
No, no.

229
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,870
Can't control your restlessness,
can you?

230
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,700
No, no, no, no.

231
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,910
Keep him on routine injections.

232
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,450
Doctor.

233
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,950
- He's your son, isn't he?
- Yes.

234
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
He's a smart boy.

235
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,500
He fled the scene
carrying his 'thing'.

236
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,410
I've sown it back.

237
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,830
Excuse us for a minute, madam.

238
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,330
And keep him away from television,
films, and magazines.

239
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,000
Or the stitches will come off...

240
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,080
...and all our efforts
will be in vain.

241
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,580
"Whatever we do...

242
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,410
- We do it under the broad daylight."
- "...under the broad daylight."

243
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,910
"Whatever we do...

244
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,000
- We do it under the broad daylight."
- "...under the broad daylight."

245
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,000
Who on earth would
want to watch his film now?

246
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,750
- Since they chopped off his 'thing'.
- So what now?

247
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,620
- Do you want to replace the hero?
- Make me the hero.

248
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,580
Yeah, right...listen to him.
- What else.

249
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,040
We already shot 15
days of footage with him.

250
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Anu. What's going on?

251
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,250
Oh, Brother.

252
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,830
Greetings, brother.

253
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,620
- Are you in the middle of a shoot?
- We were...

254
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,040
...but we're in a bit of a predicament.

255
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,750
Our lead actor, Arvind.
- Hero.

256
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,330
Poor guy got in trouble with
those boys from across the river.

257
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,540
Yeah, I know.
They chopped off his 'thing'.

258
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,580
That's exactly why I am here.

259
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,540
You don't have to worry, brother.
We'll deal with him later.

260
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,540
Oh, we will deal with
them sooner or later.

261
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,330
But who is playing your hero now?

262
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,910
- We're on the lookout.
- We'll find someone.

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,500
- Sooner or later.
- Find someone?

264
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,160
You hero's right here,
and you still want to go out looking?

265
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,120
Boss...

266
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,870
I'll play the hero.
It's a cinch for me.

267
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,450
You? I mean...

268
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,080
What?

269
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,040
Well...

270
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,620
I am tall.

271
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,410
Look at my sharp mustache.

272
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,500
And a commanding voice.

273
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,790
I am the original star of this city.

274
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,080
- Who can do it better than me?
- Right. Right...

275
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,080
Listen...

276
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,200
...when I've decided that I'll
play the hero then no one can stop me.

277
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,620
Spare him, please.
He is just a kid.

278
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,450
Spare him. Let him go.
He is just a kid.

279
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,000
You will do the film.
And it will be a blockbuster.

280
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,500
The city will go gaga over you.

281
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,250
Let's start shooting next month.

282
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,870
Next month?

283
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,830
Why next month?

284
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,910
Let's start immediately.

285
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,160
We're running low on finance.

286
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,750
How much do you need?

287
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,250
We're short of 50,000.

288
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,540
- Farzi.
- Boss.

289
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,200
Give him 50,000 and start shooting.

290
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,370
Kurbaan, give him the costume
and start the shoot.

291
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,790
- Hurry up. Hurry up.
- Come on.

292
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,790
- And give him his dialogues too.
- Come on.

293
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,330
Where is the heroine?

294
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,580
Congratulations. Congratulations.

295
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,080
Wow...brother.

296
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,660
You look amazing.

297
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,700
I'm sure no one's seen
such a handsome cop like you.

298
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,700
I mean people will be
eager to get arrested by you.

299
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,580
The crime rate in the
country will take a big dip.

300
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,000
- Anu...I've something to say.
- Of course.

301
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,540
It's a little personal.

302
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,580
What are you doing?

303
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,120
Taking your blessings.

304
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,410
You just turned my dream into reality.

305
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,370
If only I had started early...

306
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,660
...then, I would've been an artist.

307
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,040
And not a criminal.

308
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,870
I need your blessings.

309
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,370
You have my blessings.

310
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,000
May you break all records
in the field of acting.

311
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,160
Now wipe these tears
and rehearse your dialogues.

312
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,830
Okay.
I'll go ready the shot.

313
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,540
So finally you took
some time off for me.

314
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,660
'That's the sad story
of every cop, Rashmi.'

315
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,120
That's the sad story
of every cop, Rashmi.

316
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,120
'But I thought you would understand.'

317
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,620
But I thought you would understand.

318
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,540
'People look down on us.'

319
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,620
People look down on us.

320
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,250
'But we've adjusted to their views.'

321
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,200
But we've adjusted
to their views, but...

322
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,750
I expect you to show
some feelings for me.

323
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,370
But we've adjusted
to their views, but...

324
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,660
I expect you to show
some feelings for me.

325
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,950
I expect you to show
some feelings for me.

326
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,870
And if its getting unbearable for you,

327
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,950
the...then...then no one can stop you.

328
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,830
What the...

329
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,290
Hide, boss.

330
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,040
- Pehalwan Gang has attacked us.
- Where?

331
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,500
Where?

332
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,910
Spread out.

333
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,040
What the hell is this?

334
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,200
It's a fake.

335
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,910
Attention Kaptan
Singh and Pehlwan Singh.

336
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,700
The Police has you surrounded.

337
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,370
Don't try any bright moves,
or you won't make it out alive.

338
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,660
- Shahbaaz. Wait...
- Surrender yourself.

339
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,080
- For your own good.
- Wait.

340
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,500
I say it again.

341
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,040
Surrender yourself.

342
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,250
I'll be back, Anu.

343
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,790
And finish shooting.

344
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,580
Let's go.

345
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,120
You won't be seeing
the outside world too soon.

346
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,120
- Do you still have the money?
- Of course.

347
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,290
Then now we start shooting for real.

348
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,700
Pack up for now.

349
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,790
Let's go.

350
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,790
"Screw you world,
because we care a damn."

351
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,620
"My mind's loaded,
and heart's about to explode."

352
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,040
"Screw you world,
because we care a damn."

353
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,000
"My mind's loaded,
and heart's about to explode."

354
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,250
"We'll do what the heart says..."

355
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,040
"...and fear no one."

356
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,540
"We'll do what the heart says..."

357
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,160
"...and fear no one."

358
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,830
"Let's show the world..."

359
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,500
"Flerting."

360
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,700
"Flerting."

361
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,580
"Flerting."

362
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,200
"Flerting."

363
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,620
"Flerting."

364
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,410
"We're a big fan of BigB."

365
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,950
"Yes, I am the local angry man."

366
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:11,250
"When I lose my temper
you can't escape my wrath."

367
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,250
"We always take what we like."

368
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:21,040
"Those who need that
extra buttering up."

369
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,580
"Those who need that
extra buttering up."

370
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,250
"Let's show them now..."

371
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,540
"Flerting."

372
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,870
"Flerting."

373
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,870
"Flerting."

374
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,250
"Flerting."

375
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,410
"Flerting."

376
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,330
"Flerting."

377
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,040
"Flerting."

378
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,580
"Flerting."

379
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,700
What do you think
you're doing, mister?

380
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,200
Careful with that thing.

381
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,160
Brother, Where can I find Anu Sharma?

382
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,410
Looking for a chance to act?

383
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,040
Not acting.

384
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,580
Cheating.

385
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,830
Ohh...

386
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,330
- See those two boys making a racket.
- Yes.

387
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,910
And that lad standing
quietly next to them.

388
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,700
- Yes.
- That's Anu Sharma.

389
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,910
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

390
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,830
- Mister, are you Anu Sharma?
- Yes.

391
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,160
What an amazing performer.

392
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,410
An expert in shooting and cheating.

393
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,040
Wow...

394
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,750
Actually,
both require copying to an extent.

395
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,200
Ones melodramatic
and the other's skill.

396
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,200
What about you?

397
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,580
- Are you looking to act?
- No, not acting.

398
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,080
Cheating.

399
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,830
Shut up you two.

400
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,450
We have a new candidate.

401
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,290
Continue your discussion elsewhere.

402
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,580
You look like you haven't
made progress in a long time.

403
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,410
No, no, it's not me.

404
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,540
I quit studies the
moment I flunked class 8.

405
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,330
I happily bid adieu to it.

406
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,870
Because I was better without it.

407
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,370
The situation is that my niece failed
her BA exams last year.

408
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,040
Okay.

409
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,200
- What are her subjects?
- That I don't know.

410
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,160
Why don't you come
home and ask yourself?

411
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,250
- Okay...and where's your home?
- Malvi Nagar.

412
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,660
My brother-in-law's
name is Janardhan Panda.

413
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,290
He's pretty popular in our area.

414
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,040
Ask anyone and he'll personally
guide you to our home.

415
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,080
But it will cost you.

416
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,540
These services are not for free.

417
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,540
How much?

418
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,620
30,000!

419
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,830
That's the rate.

420
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:50,790
Son, it's more than what I
spend on my entire family in a month.

421
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,410
That's not my concern,
But I have to grease other palms.

422
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,620
It's not an easy task, you know.

423
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,000
We risk our lives for this.

424
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,500
And if in case we get arrested,...

425
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,500
then we're looking at 5 years imprisonment.
You got to add all that up.

426
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,200
I get it.

427
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,250
It's a kind of social
service what you're doing.

428
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,910
Whatever, but it's not free.

429
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,540
We're not asking
you to do it for free.

430
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,540
We're looking for a discount though.

431
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,870
Can you show some generosity
towards this poor priest?

432
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,870
Just a minute.
Let me make a call.

433
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,660
Hello. What's up?

434
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,620
He makes films too.

435
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,870
- Preparing to shoot?
- I'll smack you with my shoe.

436
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:22,950
Okay.

437
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,540
And...

438
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,540
Listen.

439
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,580
You have to change
the heroine's dress.

440
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,620
It's no good.

441
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,160
And if he shows off,
we'll hire someone else.

442
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,700
Okay.

443
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,120
I am arranging the money.

444
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,790
If you can pay advance,
then maybe I can do something for you.

445
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,000
And, I would like to see the girl...

446
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,660
...or I might just end up
helping the wrong girl.

447
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,700
Of course.

448
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,620
But first, let's see how generous
you are feeling towards me today.

449
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,870
Otherwise,
what's the point of seeing her.

450
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,870
She will accept
whatever is her destiny.

451
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,950
I'll give you 5000 discount.

452
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,250
Okay.

453
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,910
Janak Kumari.

454
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,290
Here I am.

455
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,660
Come.

456
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,950
Come, dear.

457
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,910
Just like I help souls across...

458
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,160
...similarly, he helps fools across.

459
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,870
He's an expert in copying.

460
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,700
And he's come here to help you.

461
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,910
That's my daughter Janak Kumari.

462
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,120
My name isn't Janak Kumari.

463
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,410
It's Maithali.

464
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,250
So says on my form as well.

465
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Fine. Nice.

466
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,950
I'll need her roll
number when she gets it.

467
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,410
Advance...

468
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,160
- Or you can even send it over.
- I'll bring it to you.

469
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,120
The Advance.

470
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,450
There you are, brother-in-law.
It's settled then.

471
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,910
See you then.

472
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,040
Please.

473
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,370
See...now that's how it's done.

474
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,540
Hariya.

475
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,040
It's the first time you've
done something sensible.

476
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,040
Thank you.

477
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,000
Otherwise, as the saying goes...

478
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,370
Brothers-in-law never bring
you any good fortune.

479
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,500
Who is that guy?

480
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,370
It's high time, boss.

481
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,750
You should get married now.

482
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,120
Marriage is okay,
but what about the stuff that follows?

483
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,870
Come here.

484
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,120
Hold this?

485
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,160
Give me that.

486
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,450
What are you doing, boss?
Let it be.

487
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,120
Are you going to teach me now?

488
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,000
Don't teach me.

489
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,910
- Don't try to teach me.
- Let him go!

490
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,790
As***

491
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,830
Pandit Chim Ali.

492
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
From Rajasthan.

493
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,700
That's me.

494
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,200
I want you to review
a birth chart for me.

495
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,410
Enough. Wrap it up.

496
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,660
Why do you want your
sister to marry this guy?

497
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,950
Why?

498
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,870
What's the problem?

499
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,000
Mars and Saturn have
a strong influence on him.

500
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,750
Meaning he's short-tempered
and easily provocative.

501
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,040
Your sister is not safe with him.

502
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,120
In fact, no one is safe around him.

503
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,750
Not to mention Jupiter, Rahu, and
the Moon together in the 12th house.

504
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,080
Is he sick?

505
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,120
Don't know.

506
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,870
Cancel this wedding right now.

507
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,750
Why? What's wrong?

508
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,660
You would like your sister
to marry a man, wouldn't you?

509
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,330
He is not a man.

510
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,620
I've heard that you're
a very wise man.

511
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,660
There must be some solution to it.

512
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,580
Take a good look
at this piece of wood.

513
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,790
If you keep it in
water even for a decade...

514
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,950
...it won't turn green or light a fire.

515
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,000
Stay away from this guy.

516
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,290
He doesn't even belong in the society.

517
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,040
In fact, he belongs in jail.

518
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,290
That will be 1000 rupees.

519
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,040
I am letting you live.

520
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,500
That's your fee.

521
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,370
I guess this is your birth chart.

522
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,750
Did you have to say that?

523
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,790
What...What are you doing?

524
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,120
I will show you stars and planets...

525
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,660
Look, Mr. Ghanshyam Das,
don't threaten me to go to the Police.

526
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,700
There are already 5
cases registered against me.

527
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,580
The truck didn't arrive on time
because a riot broke out in the city.

528
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Mom...

529
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,290
Tell me. what does Maithali mean?

530
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,370
- Maithali?
- Yes.

531
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,790
It's one of Sita's names.

532
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,910
But why do you want to know?

533
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,750
No...just like that.

534
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,330
Bring that.

535
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:46,660
"Every bud doubts me."

536
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,040
- Let's go.
- Of course.

537
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,700
You too. Come on.

538
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,370
"There's a storm brewing..."

539
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,580
Stop, father. Stop.

540
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,700
Try a different song for a change.

541
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,410
Why?

542
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,620
Because this one's been done to death.
People are fed up of it.

543
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,000
Loafer. Dharmender.

544
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,000
Its how people addressed all my life...

545
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,250
We have Kuljit Singh...

546
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,620
Darling,
why did you change the channel?

547
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,160
Consider it to be educational.

548
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,790
Which you never did.

549
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,450
Time changes every person.

550
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,750
But your father has been constant.

551
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,790
You didn't even spare our kid.

552
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,000
Sobha, why bow before the
time that changes a person's nature.

553
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,120
And you...

554
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,830
You are an illusion.

555
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,450
- An illusion under the garb of a...
- How are you doing?

556
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,500
When?

557
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,290
He carries his phone
even to the dining table.

558
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,580
What? 10 days later,
But I am already shooting now.

559
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,500
Fine, I won't miss this opportunity.

560
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,160
Okay, done, done.

561
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,870
I am off to Mumbai.

562
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,250
They are offering me
a job as an Asst. Director.

563
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,370
No one's going anywhere,
We're all staying right here.

564
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,790
- No one's going anywhere.
- What is your problem?

565
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,870
No. What is your problem?

566
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,700
- Do you have a problem?
- Of course, I do.

567
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,450
What?

568
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,040
Because we have a good home,
a successful business.

569
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,200
What's in Mumbai?

570
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,620
Because I want to do something solid.

571
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,410
I don't want to play
around all my life.

572
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,500
Not everyone gets to
play around all his life.

573
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,870
You're life's on the right track,
so don't mess it up.

574
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,290
I spent 5 years in Mumbai.

575
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,250
And all you get is humiliation and
no appreciation for your hard work.

576
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,870
Time speeds past.

577
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,160
And just because you
had a bad experience...

578
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,620
...you can't hold the entire
film industry responsible for it.

579
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,540
You couldn't do it
because you didn't have it.

580
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,910
What?

581
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,830
Let it be.

582
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,000
Finish your sentence.
You know I hate it when you do that.

583
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,040
What didn't I have?

584
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,000
Talent.

585
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,000
If I lacked talent, son.

586
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,000
You're not going to be a
superstar either. Take it from me.

587
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,580
And you are not going.

588
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,700
If in case you sneak out
or try to storm out of here...

589
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:43,450
- ...I will drown myself in the river.
- Oh, God.

590
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,540
What a temper.

591
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,950
Stop teasing me.

592
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,870
Drink some water.

593
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,830
We're done.

594
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,370
Finish your meal.

595
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,450
No one's sneaking
or storming out of here.

596
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,830
When I get my calling, I'll
take your blessings before I leave.

597
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
- I see.
- Yeah.

598
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,490
I am an MBA.

599
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,820
M B A.

600
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,820
I also know a little English.

601
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,950
I am willing to do any work.

602
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,780
Even as a security guard.

603
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,070
I'll give myself six more months.

604
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,820
So that after I am dead people
don't complain that I was a coward.

605
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,820
And Cut.

606
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,990
Phattu, come here.

607
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,660
Focus the camera on him.

608
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,410
Very nice. Very nice.

609
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,160
Come here.

610
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,410
That boy was amazing.

611
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,490
He was citing the truth.
This is the situation these days.

612
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,410
It's happening all
over the country right now.

613
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,360
Here's the advance.

614
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,780
And Maithali's roll number.

615
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,860
I see...
You can sit under the shade.

616
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,860
- That way.
- Yes, dear.

617
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,860
Go on.

618
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,030
I will need her mobile.

619
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,990
You mean her mobile number?

620
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,490
No, I will need her mobile.
Her mobile phone.

621
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,320
Why?

622
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,360
Because I need it.

623
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,360
Do you want me to explain
the entire process now?

624
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,530
Anu.

625
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,490
We called Bhola to play
the role of Inspector Tiwari.

626
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,860
But he backed out at the last minute.

627
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,110
Didn't show up.

628
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,780
Turn this way.

629
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,450
- He's going to play the inspector.
- Him.

630
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,160
What say, uncle?

631
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,740
No, I've never faced
the camera in my life.

632
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,110
It may be too overwhelming for him.

633
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,990
And it's an important role.

634
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:33,450
Not to forget he's
got an action scene.

635
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,110
With riots and everything...

636
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:40,780
And the one where he angrily cites his
dialogues in front of the chief minister.

637
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
- I don't think he can...
- Wait a minute.

638
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,360
Hang up that phone.

639
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,450
Sir...

640
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,910
- Anu sir.
- What?

641
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,740
Praise the Lord.

642
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,700
You've been tied to a tree.

643
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,410
Okay.

644
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,070
And you're screaming at the top
of your voice while challenging them.

645
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,610
Okay.

646
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,280
You'll say that once you break free,
you'll kill each one of them.

647
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,450
Awesome.

648
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,070
The camera's on that side.
I want to hear you roar. Okay.

649
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Action!

650
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,110
Lunch break.

651
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,990
Look.
- Lunch break everyone.

652
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:16,070
Let me go and I'll show you
what I'll do to all of you.

653
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,160
Or I'll never show my face again.

654
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,070
You really thought...

655
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,240
...I'll be scared if you tie
me to a tree.

656
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,110
So, you need to pass your exams...

657
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
...because your marriage depends on it.

658
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,610
I was supposed to
get married last year.

659
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,160
But unfortunately, I failed my exams.

660
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,030
And the wedding was canceled.

661
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,070
But, my father managed to convince
them to wait for another year.

662
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,280
As he is highly educated...

663
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,490
...he wants even me to...

664
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,030
Rascals...I will gut
all of you like a fish.

665
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,780
Untie me.

666
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,490
Anu sir, are we finished yet?

667
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,910
What's the name?

668
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,360
I told you...it's Maithali.

669
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,410
- I meant him.
- Him

670
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,240
- Charandas.
- What?

671
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,700
Charandas Panda.

672
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,990
What the...

673
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,240
I would prefer committing suicide...

674
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,240
...over marrying someone with that name.

675
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,160
We'll think of something else.

676
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,320
Even I am not too keen on his name.

677
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,360
And what about him?

678
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,490
Maithili..

679
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,240
I guess we'll begin to get
along eventually after the wedding.

680
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,610
Stop being so formal.

681
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,990
You're not married to him yet.

682
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,110
Call him by his bloody name.

683
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,200
Charandas.

684
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Look...

685
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,910
...please don't get too personal.

686
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,280
Don't you want to take ice-cream
for brother-in-law?

687
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,200
I am warning you.

688
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,610
Anu sir...

689
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,030
Buddy.

690
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,820
Sir. Excuse me.

691
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,200
Sir, please untie me.

692
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,070
You cannot do this to me.
The law...

693
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,070
Anu sir, I can feel
a sharp pain in my chest.

694
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,360
Anu sir.

695
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,700
Do you have a mobile?

696
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:49,950
I do.

697
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,780
Anu sir, I can feel
a sharp pain in my chest.

698
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,860
- Tell me.
- Give it to me.

699
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,450
But why...

700
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,320
Even your uncle was
asking too many questions?

701
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,860
What? Why?

702
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,240
Give it.

703
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,030
I'll tell you why.

704
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,740
"Whatever we do,

705
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:18,490
- we do it in broad daylight."
- "...in broad daylight."

706
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,070
"Whatever we do,

707
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,860
- we do it in broad daylight."
- "...in broad daylight."

708
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,410
"Whatever we do,

709
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,200
- we do it in broad daylight."
- "...in broad daylight."

710
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,490
"Whatever we do..."

711
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,160
1003...1004...

712
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,070
Got it. Got it. Got it.
Hold this. Hold this.

713
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,200
Give the watchman 1000 rupees.

714
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,820
500 for his efforts,
and 500 his reward.

715
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:51,660
- How much longer? We've got to go.
- Wait. Don't be so impatient.

716
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,490
Come on, hurry up.
What took you so long?

717
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,280
Hello.

718
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,490
This is the rest,
after the discount that you gave us.

719
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,200
- What is your name?
- Maithili.

720
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,200
Come on, hurry up.
We're running out of time.

721
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,320
Now listen, we've installed
new sim cards on everyone's phone.

722
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,200
Okay.

723
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,450
The phone's on silent mode...

724
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,450
...and there is only one number
stored in the contacts.

725
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,070
And you've to send your question paper
only on that number.

726
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:19,070
Put your phone back to where
you found it when the exam's over.

727
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,490
We don't have your
personal contact numbers...

728
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,700
...and we haven't given you ours.

729
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,070
So how are you going to contact us?

730
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,320
There is no need for that.

731
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,360
We will call you.

732
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:27,990
Now leave. All the best.

733
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,360
- Uncle.
- Go on, dear. All the best.

734
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,820
- Do the best...
- Why don't you see her inside?

735
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,320
No, I was just trying
to boost her confidence.

736
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,160
Maithali.

737
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,990
Pass the question paper.

738
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,200
Pass the question paper.

739
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,070
All the best.

740
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,410
Is everything going as planned?

741
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,110
- Did you get the question papers?
- Yes, we did.

742
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,740
Now hurry up.

743
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,410
The students are waiting.

744
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,030
Tea and snacks will keep coming.

745
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,160
So hurry up.

746
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,160
What's the answer to this one...

747
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,490
Confused?

748
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,530
If only you had studied properly,
then it wouldn't have come to this?

749
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,070
That's not it, sir.
I am racking my brains.

750
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,860
I'll come up with an answer.

751
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:23,990
Got it, sir.

752
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,780
Maithili.

753
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,110
- How was your exam?
- Very good.

754
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,530
- Don't worry, uncle.
- I see...

755
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,950
You should begin
preparations for the wedding.

756
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,490
Wow!

757
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,200
Anu sir,
when will I get to perform next?

758
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:51,450
If you can tell me in advance,
I can prepare for it.

759
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,860
The other day, I...

760
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,200
I haven't studied any of this.

761
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,820
What is that?

762
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,530
Question paper, sir.

763
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,610
What just happened.

764
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,740
What's going on there?

765
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,740
Luckily he didn't
disclose anyone's name.

766
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,160
But now frequency jammers have
been installed all over the campus...

767
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,110
- ...and mobile phones have been banned.
- Hey you...

768
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,780
Yes...

769
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,780
Don't hold these meetings in here.

770
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,030
I don't want cops at my door.

771
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,740
- It's...
- I don't want to hear anything.

772
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,490
- Brother Usman.
- Cops are not coming here.

773
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,360
Jammers, huh.

774
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,160
What are we going to do now?

775
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,860
First, we need to
teach that lad a lesson.

776
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,570
Why are you crying now?

777
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,990
You've made their lives hell.

778
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,280
And I said this very clearly.

779
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,570
If anyone makes a mistake,
then its all over.

780
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,910
No one's getting a refund.
I specifically said that.

781
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,320
Didn't I? Remember?

782
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,450
And listen...

783
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,910
If anyone asks me questions...

784
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:12,360
...then I will beat
you all black and blue.

785
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,320
Please save me, brother.
Save me.

786
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,450
Get lost.

787
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,990
Please save me, brother.
Save me.

788
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,910
You wasted our money.

789
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,240
Come on.

790
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,030
Go on.
Go on.

791
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,160
We'll show him, all right.

792
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,160
But I want my money back.

793
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,530
Don't say that.

794
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,990
I'll think of something.

795
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,240
Help you pass your exam.

796
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,910
Maithili's desk is
next to that window.

797
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,160
Second one.

798
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,410
That one.

799
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,160
We can see it from here.

800
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,200
We'll see it very clearly.

801
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,240
Listen.

802
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,530
I fail to understand why you're
taking such a risk for this girl?

803
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,110
Why do you want to hear
it from the horse's mouth...

804
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,660
...when it's clearly
evident on his face.

805
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,450
See for yourself.

806
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,660
What's evident on my face?

807
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,200
You are in love, lad.

808
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,160
Yes.

809
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,200
And we're the uninvited guests
to this wedding...

810
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,820
...waiting to get pummeled.

811
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,160
You're not helping her pass her exams
so she can marry someone else?

812
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,530
You're helping her so
that you get to marry her.

813
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,610
Marriage...

814
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,780
- What on earth are you saying?
- You heard that right.

815
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,070
It all starts with a kiss,
leading all the way to...

816
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,410
Phatu, don't talk nonsense.

817
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,320
See...that hurts, doesn't it?

818
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,110
That proves I am right.

819
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,860
He's right.

820
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,820
Tell us.

821
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,070
I don't know.

822
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,860
Every time I look at her,

823
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,240
I feel something inside.

824
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,070
- How do I explain this?
- Great.

825
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,820
You did the right thing
by telling your friends.

826
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,950
Honestly.

827
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,950
But you'll get the girl
when she flunks her exam.

828
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,160
And if she aces her exams, then
she will be married to someone else.

829
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
That's the deal, right?

830
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,700
It's not confirmed
yet that she loves me too.

831
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,570
What do you mean?

832
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,860
Do we look like idiots running around

833
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,490
the longitude and
latitude of this college.

834
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,780
I won't let that happen.

835
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,660
Even if my love's one-sided...

836
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,110
...but, I won't give anyone
the opportunity to say...

837
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,780
That Anu's girlfriend failed her exam.

838
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,570
She will pass with merit.

839
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,450
I gave her my word.

840
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:34,240
"Thanks to all the
Engineers and doctors."

841
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:40,030
"Because I have a degree in love."

842
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,110
"And life's useless without it."

843
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,910
"The future looks dark..."

844
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,410
"...and yet we dream
to touch the moon someday."

845
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,490
"Whatever we do,

846
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,780
- we do it in broad daylight."
- "...in broad daylight."

847
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,740
"Whatever we do,

848
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,200
- we do it in broad daylight."
- "...in broad daylight."

849
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,070
- "Whatever we do...
- Up. Up... Got it. Got it. Got it.

850
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,700
Come in, Charlie.
Come in.

851
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,740
Charlie Speaking.

852
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,700
What is the question, Tiger?

853
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,820
Note it down.

854
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,610
In 6th Century B.C.

855
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,530
What is B.C?

856
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:16,990
British Columbia.

857
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,700
Shut up.

858
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,450
Write an essay on the Political
situation of Western India...

859
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,240
...in the 6th Century B.C.

860
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,110
Imagine.

861
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,320
How else will students
pass their exams?

862
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,450
Chandragupta Maurya's...

863
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,490
Give me that.

864
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,780
Hello.

865
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,450
Who is speaking on this frequency?

866
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,950
- It's me.
- Who?

867
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,530
- Who is speaking
- Hello.

868
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,530
Jignesh, exams are in progress.

869
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,740
We would like your comment
on the security arrangements?

870
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,570
Yes, Deepak...

871
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,280
What is going on here? Don't
you know students are writing exams?

872
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,570
What are you doing?

873
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,820
- It's an interview, sir.
- Oh, an interview.

874
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,990
Well, sir. Do you think
the students are cheating...

875
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,820
- Out of the question...
- Let's go. Let's go.

876
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,110
Sorry for the delay, sir.

877
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,070
So why call me here?

878
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,910
Why did you show
up in the first place?

879
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,780
I thought maybe you need help
with some research...

880
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,110
...since you make films.

881
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,780
If its research I wanted,
then we could've met at the tea-stall.

882
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,990
Then why call me here?

883
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,490
Two-large whiskey...
Do you drink whiskey?

884
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,240
Look.

885
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,660
I won't accept anything until
you don't tell me what this is about.

886
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,530
Come closer.

887
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,030
Sir, you know that I make films.

888
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,700
- Yes.
- Yes...

889
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,780
And that requires to
be pretty close to girls.

890
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,700
Yes.

891
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,780
Yes...

892
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,820
I had a job for you.

893
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,490
If you say no, we'll both share
a drink and forget this ever happened.

894
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,160
But if its a yes...

895
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,200
"I want to stroke your tresses..."

896
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:18,450
"And anoint your forehead..."

897
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,660
Sir...

898
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,490
- "The feelings in my heart..."
- Sir...

899
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,530
Get lost.

900
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,700
"...I want to..."

901
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,820
Today is the last day of your exams.

902
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:33,110
So don't try anything
that you haven't done yet.

903
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,950
Meaning no cheating.

904
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,160
How is the paper?

905
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,530
It's pretty easy.

906
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:50,990
I'll be right back.

907
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,570
Sir, your coffee.

908
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,110
Here you are.

909
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,610
- Get me the English newspaper.
- Okay.

910
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,660
He's asking for the English newspaper.

911
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,950
Go on to the staffroom.
I'll see you there.

912
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,530
Jai Hind.

913
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,530
Sir.

914
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,070
It's me.

915
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,490
- These are the questions.
- Okay.

916
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,570
- And here's the answer sheet.
- Okay.

917
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,860
- Get to work.
- Okay.

918
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,110
And hurry up. We don't have time.

919
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,240
Sir. Here's your English newspaper.

920
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,110
You're back, dear.

921
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,320
I guess you left a blank paper today.

922
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,200
Not at all.
I solved the entire paper.

923
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,160
Did you get the answers?

924
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,700
Hey mister, according to our deal...

925
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:47,030
- you owe me 3000 rupees.
- What for?

926
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,490
Maithili solved the
question paper on her own.

927
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,860
With such tight Police security...

928
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:50,740
I sent her the answers.

929
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,280
And you want me to believe that.

930
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,860
Maithili will tell you how.

931
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,910
I wrote it on a piece of paper,
remember.

932
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:01,780
Yes.

933
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,610
Yes, yes...

934
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,320
It said that your job's done.

935
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,530
So no need to meet again.

936
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:10,610
Absolutely right.

937
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,410
You don't even have her phone number.

938
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,490
So what now?

939
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,240
Stand outside her house every day?

940
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,200
Another show's over.

941
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,700
Only a couple of days more,
and this place will be deserted again.

942
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,610
The paper was awesome.

943
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,780
Look at these handsome
guys in Badmaash Company.

944
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:28,950
She is here.

945
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,780
She is here. Maithali's here.

946
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,610
Call him.
Are you calling, Anu?

947
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,780
Of course.

948
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,160
I'll go arrange for the tickets.

949
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:37,610
- Dude.
- What?

950
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,610
I have some good news for you.
Better brace yourself.

951
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:43,450
- Are you standing next to your wall?
- Stop talking in riddles.

952
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,780
Your first lady's coming.

953
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,910
With some friend of hers.

954
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,530
I can see vermillion on her forehead.

955
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,530
- What?
- He meant her friend.

956
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,240
Don't confuse me.
You almost scared the life out of me.

957
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,160
It wasn't me, it was Phattu.

958
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,110
I am coming.

959
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,200
Come soon.

960
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,700
Let's go. Let's go.

961
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,110
Now, look.

962
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,030
I told you to hurry up.

963
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:10,200
But no, you wanted to wear
matching earrings, Matching bangles.

964
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,950
Wait a minute.
I will talk to the manager.

965
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:13,610
- He will do something.
- We came all the way here.

966
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,610
Manager?

967
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,200
- What can the manager do?
- It's you?

968
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,070
No tickets, huh!

969
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:19,740
I'll arrange for something.

970
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,320
Mayank. Phattu.
- Who is he?

971
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:22,700
Yeah... What?

972
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,160
Do you have extra tickets?

973
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,070
- Yes, we do.
- We don't want it.

974
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,910
- We do.
- I was going to return it.

975
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,360
But why?
- How many do you have?

976
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:29,700
- Six.
- Six?

977
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,070
Six? There you are.

978
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:34,160
- Come on. Come on.
- We'll pay for our tickets.

979
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,910
Money is not a problem.

980
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,160
Just come on.

981
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:47,700
Listen...this seat is empty.

982
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,280
So...why don't we shift to this side.

983
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,110
Whoever comes later,
can sit on that side.

984
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,910
We'll see when he comes.

985
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,360
Let him come.

986
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,450
If you don't like him,
we'll tell him to sit here.

987
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:01,780
They are trying to be smart.

988
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,820
They are not that bad after all.
I know these kids.

989
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,820
- They helped me pass...
- Look at their faces.

990
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,110
"It was important to look like
businessmen in order to do business."

991
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:18,910
"To make more money, it was
crucial to look like we had money."

992
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,240
You didn't give a reply.

993
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,450
What for?

994
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,910
The question I asked you.

995
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,530
Did you say something?

996
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:41,530
Not at all.

997
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:48,990
Bloody pervert.

998
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,530
Let's go get some tea.

999
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,200
Would you like some tea or coffee?

1000
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:09,070
Let's go take a stroll outside.

1001
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,360
Maithili, give me your number.

1002
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,780
You can call if you ever need tickets.

1003
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,030
We won't.

1004
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,490
You can even give a missed call.

1005
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,240
Take my number instead.

1006
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,990
Your husband wouldn't like that.

1007
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,700
I'll introduce you two.

1008
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,530
He won't mind when he sees your face.

1009
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,410
I'll get some popcorn for you two.

1010
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,780
What a leach.

1011
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:42,860
Jal (Water).

1012
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,360
Because water is life.

1013
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,860
Now we had to get in their land...

1014
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,450
...and put them out of business.

1015
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,660
Listen, I will be right back.

1016
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:12,910
I will come along too.

1017
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:15,160
I'll be absolutely fine on my own.

1018
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,160
Wait here.

1019
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,530
- I'll be right back.
- Okay...

1020
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,950
"...but different business."

1021
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,070
"First we took report on the biggest..."

1022
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,410
Sorry...

1023
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,570
"Samples are okay.

1024
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,070
but what about price."

1025
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,610
"Charlie, we are new..."

1026
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,570
It's a small answer.

1027
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,320
Yes or no.

1028
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,660
You can even nod if you like.

1029
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,530
I never thought I'll
be asking you this.

1030
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,160
In fact, I didn't even
ask for your mobile number.

1031
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,110
And I had to ask in
front of an entire crowd.

1032
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,450
So...what?

1033
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,110
I am getting married.

1034
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:28,070
Will you marry that
Charandas willingly?

1035
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,200
But I will have to
once I pass my exam.

1036
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:41,360
- You should've let me fail.
- Out of the question.

1037
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,740
Imagine what the people will say.

1038
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,070
Anu's girlfriend is a failure.

1039
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,570
You took so many risks
in order to make me pass.

1040
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,110
- I did.
- Thank you.

1041
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,740
I did what I had to.

1042
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:18,610
But, I can do anything
to get you closer.

1043
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:21,450
Me too.

1044
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,410
Even I can do anything.

1045
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,240
What can you do?

1046
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,070
I can do whatever you can.

1047
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:38,780
I see...

1048
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:42,660
You haven't answered my question yet.

1049
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,700
Why should I?

1050
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,160
If you really love me,
then guess it yourself.

1051
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,610
Hey...Come here!

1052
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,740
I was looking for you, sir.

1053
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,110
I have the money.

1054
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:21,660
Money?

1055
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:23,990
You said you're a man if your words.

1056
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,490
So how can you go
back on your words now?

1057
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,700
Who says that I am?

1058
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,450
- I have brought your money.
- Good morning, sir.

1059
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:31,990
You were supposed to send me a girl.

1060
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,240
So what happened?

1061
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:36,070
Who do you think I am?

1062
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,240
A pimp?

1063
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,530
If you ever set your
eyes on that girl again,

1064
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,490
I will rearrange your face.
Understand.

1065
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,820
Lower your eyes whenever you see her.

1066
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,110
Like she is a Goddess of sorts.

1067
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,610
Otherwise,
the entire city will clean your clock.

1068
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,740
I took a risk.

1069
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,320
I brought her paper outside.

1070
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,200
The Police were posted everywhere.

1071
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:01,780
You see, professor...

1072
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,160
Good morning, sir.

1073
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:06,320
You were supposed
to give us Botany notes.

1074
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,780
I have a headache right now.
Later, okay.

1075
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,910
Fine.

1076
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,740
Seriously, brother Usman.

1077
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,900
The place looks like a garbage dump.

1078
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:20,900
I mean at least keep your workplace
neat and clean.

1079
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,900
This is my room.

1080
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,450
I'll keep it as I want.

1081
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,030
She is coming over, understands.

1082
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,780
And girls hate garbage.

1083
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:32,610
This is why you're still a bachelor.

1084
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:35,150
Don't try to get wise with me.
Still a bachelor.

1085
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:36,860
Even I was in love.

1086
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:37,860
The Shakespearian kind.

1087
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,490
But this society didn't approve of it.
Understand.

1088
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:40,650
Let it be.

1089
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,990
She is here.

1090
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,650
Hi.

1091
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:45,610
Hi.

1092
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,280
Maithili.

1093
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:48,320
This is brother Usman.

1094
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,150
- He's like...
- An older brother to him.

1095
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,240
Yes, like a brother.

1096
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:52,700
- Come, let's have a cup of tea.
- Hello.

1097
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,610
Brother, we'll handle it from here.

1098
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:00,740
Look, I've already loaded the film.
Keep checking on it.

1099
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:02,200
- Understand?
- Yes.

1100
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:06,280
See you.

1101
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,200
How long do you have?

1102
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:14,900
How long is the film?

1103
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,280
Film?

1104
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,450
The film's two-hour long.

1105
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,490
It used to be even longer.

1106
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,320
But these bloody multiplexes...

1107
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,110
...cut it shorter in order to
adjust more shows.

1108
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,700
You don't talk, do you?

1109
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:41,320
This is all you care.

1110
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,280
Is this why you love me?

1111
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:47,530
For this obscenity.

1112
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:49,400
No...

1113
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:53,110
I've heard that when
love is pretty new...

1114
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,900
...there's a lot of sex involved.

1115
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:57,860
That's what I heard.

1116
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,360
And when love grows old.

1117
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:04,450
Then they do it only a couple of days.

1118
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,990
Like on Holi-Diwali-or-Birth day.

1119
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:15,280
Listen...we won't let that happen.

1120
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,820
We'll talk and make love too.

1121
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,490
Anu, someone's at the door.

1122
00:54:58,990 --> 00:54:59,450
Anu...

1123
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,320
Someone's at the door.

1124
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:08,610
I knew that two shows
can't run in the same theatre.

1125
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:13,110
Your love will get me fired
from my job.

1126
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,360
Can't you hear the racket?

1127
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:31,200
"I end up being jobless."

1128
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,780
"Little boredom, little madness."

1129
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:36,950
"Everything seems sentimental."

1130
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,650
"I feel empty inside."

1131
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:43,360
"It's the side effect of love."

1132
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:46,530
"Since its already struck,
then be prepared."

1133
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,360
"We call it love."

1134
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:52,320
"It's the best feeling you can have."

1135
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:55,400
"Since its already here,
then be prepared."

1136
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:57,320
"We call it love."

1137
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:16,030
"Love's full of hassle,
but it's a must."

1138
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,860
"Even if I get beaten,
but you got to die for it."

1139
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,700
"Love's full of hassle,
but it's a must."

1140
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,240
"Even if I get beaten,
but you got to die for it."

1141
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,110
"I keep looking at my phone..."

1142
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,820
"...and lose my sleep over it."

1143
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,530
"The heart says I've had enough, man."

1144
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:41,610
"And yet he's the apple of your eye."

1145
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,740
"We call it love."

1146
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:47,360
"It's the best feeling you can have."

1147
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:50,530
"Since its already struck,
then be prepared."

1148
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,150
"We call it love."

1149
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:03,530
What took you so long, father?

1150
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,070
"6th June."

1151
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:20,360
"I met with Anu in
Milan Talkies today."

1152
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,320
"And we got into little trouble."

1153
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:26,780
Brother-in-law, I've brought
the details that you asked for.

1154
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,820
And I feel this Santro
car is the best choice.

1155
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:34,530
It's economical. Fuel-efficient.
and spacious like any sedan.

1156
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:36,530
It's Korean.

1157
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:39,150
No, thank you. I will pass.

1158
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,780
Hold it.

1159
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,990
What was my mistake this time?

1160
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:56,400
Remember why I slapped
you the last time?

1161
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:01,200
It was when you saw me
strolling around with Uma.

1162
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:04,860
You were madly in love with that
Jaiswal's daughter.

1163
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,650
And I can see the same
situation building up again.

1164
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:11,490
I swear brother-in-law,
I am not involved with any girl now.

1165
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:13,360
And, since that day...
Please, hear me out.

1166
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,400
Since that day,
I've turned completely moralistic.

1167
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:17,650
The glow on Maithali's face...

1168
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,240
...is the same that you had.

1169
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,280
If anything goes wrong, Hariya...

1170
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,610
...this small car which is luxurious
like a sedan...

1171
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,610
...will mean nothing.

1172
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:31,110
- Says who, brother-in-law.
- Papa...

1173
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,030
There is no balance on my phone.

1174
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,700
Can you recharge my
phone's talk time, please?

1175
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,200
Hold this.

1176
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:38,900
No.

1177
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,200
- Okay.
- I won't do anything.

1178
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,860
Give it here, dear.

1179
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,280
Now listen carefully.

1180
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:51,740
Your exam results are due soon.

1181
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,820
If you manage to pass, then we'll
start preparing for your wedding.

1182
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,490
No more going out of the house.

1183
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,240
If anyone wants to meet you,
then he can come home.

1184
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,780
- Please, papa...
- Enough!

1185
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,820
Is that 73 or 7?

1186
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:08,900
- That's 73.
- Wow...

1187
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:20,030
"Love is a bundle of trouble,
and yet I accept it."

1188
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:24,200
"When you feel a connection,
no logic applies."

1189
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:30,650
"Love is a bundle of trouble,
and yet I accept it."

1190
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,490
"When you feel a connection,
no logic applies."

1191
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:37,950
"Be careful,
and look in every direction."

1192
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:40,950
The Malvi Nagar Ram-Leela Committee...

1193
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:45,780
...welcomes all of you
to the Celebration of 2010

1194
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,740
"We call it love."

1195
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,490
And now for another announcement...

1196
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:54,530
Sonu Samrat who owns the Blue
motorcycle 7599 has donated 51 rupees.

1197
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:55,860
"We call it love."

1198
00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:03,110
Scorpio UGS-5050 has donated
151 rupees to the committee.

1199
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,860
From Mr. Vishambhar Das Goel.

1200
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:11,990
Another request,
who has kept her name anonymous.

1201
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:16,740
She says,
see you tomorrow at Milan Talkies.

1202
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,360
Please note that down.

1203
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,200
See you tomorrow at Milan Talkies.

1204
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:25,950
I can see hurdles.

1205
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,200
But no need to worry.

1206
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,900
Things will settle down in a year.

1207
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,820
In fact, we don't match
birth charts in love marriages.

1208
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,490
But my advice is...

1209
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:41,650
...that we should match the birth charts
of the in-laws first.

1210
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:42,780
Right?

1211
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,780
Whether the son's birth
chart matches or not...

1212
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,030
...but the mother-in-law and
daughter-in-law...

1213
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:48,650
Papa, can I go to the temple.

1214
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,990
I made a pact that I'll go and pray
if I pass my exam.

1215
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:52,950
Yes, of course.

1216
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,450
She passed her exams with merit.

1217
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:56,240
Congratulations.

1218
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,700
My beloved daughter.

1219
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,780
And I had to recharge my mobile phone.

1220
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:06,200
The mobile revolution has
sent this country to the dogs.

1221
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,150
People even eat while walking.

1222
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,070
It's clearly been
said in the scriptures.

1223
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,070
That food,
women, treasure, and praying...

1224
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:14,780
...should be done behind closed doors.

1225
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,110
- No.
- I won't make any mistake this time.

1226
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:17,950
That's not that question.

1227
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:20,150
The show is a houseful.
Completely houseful.

1228
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,780
The crowd will tear up the seats.

1229
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:23,740
We haven't met for a month,
brother Usman.

1230
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,490
Then meet her someplace else.

1231
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:26,530
Meet her someplace else?

1232
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:28,110
We are not living in Mumbai...

1233
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:31,530
...that I can meet her on the streets,
or the train, or on the beach.

1234
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,200
Have some mercy.

1235
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,700
And I know you like love stories.

1236
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:40,530
She's here.

1237
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,450
No, no, I won't tolerate this here.

1238
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,950
Unbelievable.
No respect for me.

1239
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:53,780
- Such a virtuous place this is, but you two...
- Boozing is allowed here.

1240
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:54,990
- What?
- Booze...

1241
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,990
What booze?

1242
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,360
You two have crossed all limits.

1243
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,860
You know I can't say anything to you,
Maithili.

1244
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:03,990
Except for one thing.

1245
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:05,570
Stay in control.

1246
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,450
Don't get carried away.

1247
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:09,360
The movie is playing.

1248
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:12,360
This is wrong. wrong.

1249
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,740
Now we'll have to put up
a "Do Not Disturb" board here.

1250
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,650
How long do you have?

1251
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,200
Only 15 minutes.

1252
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,740
I said I am going to the temple.

1253
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:43,530
I am not letting you go today.

1254
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:53,900
Which temple?

1255
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,740
Answer the phone.

1256
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:58,240
- It's Anu.
- Answer it.

1257
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:00,610
He's right here.

1258
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:02,240
Hello.

1259
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,320
Never.

1260
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,700
And listen.

1261
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,360
Don't talk rubbish with me.

1262
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:11,530
Some things are possible,
and some are not.

1263
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,950
Don't expect me to put myself
in a mess so you can impress the girl.

1264
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,610
- I am not stupid.
- What is the matter?

1265
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,110
- He's impossible
- Yeah...

1266
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:18,820
I see...

1267
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,700
Okay. Okay.
Don't worry, dude.

1268
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,360
- Have fun.
- What fun?

1269
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:24,030
I cannot do this. Count me out.

1270
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,700
Phattu. You know what,

1271
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,280
I shouldn't be going in there.

1272
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,030
- Understood.
- Yeah.

1273
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,570
But if Anu's idea works...

1274
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:35,490
...then I will handle the situation
outside.

1275
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:37,780
Go on.

1276
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,700
I am not coming.
Please...

1277
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:42,240
Come on.
Take the Lord's name and...

1278
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,070
Hail Sri Ram!

1279
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:50,570
How can I lie to God?

1280
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:52,360
I cannot lie to God.

1281
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,650
You're going to be a Lawyer
in the future. So get used to it.

1282
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:58,320
- Greetings, priest.
- Greetings...

1283
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,360
Listen...

1284
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:05,740
Lord Nandi is drinking milk!

1285
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:08,240
Lord Nandi is drinking milk!

1286
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,110
It's a miracle.

1287
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,320
It's a miracle.

1288
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:19,820
The place is packed now.

1289
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:21,490
And the crowd's still pouring in.

1290
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,360
Also, this incident has been recorded
in the history of our city.

1291
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:24,450
Fantastic.

1292
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:27,320
You will never find
a friend like me, Anu.

1293
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,450
Phattu...

1294
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:31,530
No one's going to
call you Phattu anymore.

1295
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,820
Go on.

1296
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:35,110
Now call your father.

1297
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,110
And tell him that
the temple is packed.

1298
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,490
And it will take me at least an hour.

1299
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:54,990
Big deal.

1300
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:58,570
I should be thanking
your friends, not you.

1301
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:02,030
Do I have to become the Prime Minister
to make you happy?

1302
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:05,240
Even if you become the Prime Minister,
you'll do it for the country.

1303
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,700
But what about me?

1304
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:10,490
I'm going to be this country's
biggest film director.

1305
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,990
Fine.
Again, you'll do it for your country.

1306
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:14,740
But what about me?

1307
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,280
All I know is that I'm
going to be a film director.

1308
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,610
That's all.
I don't know.

1309
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:24,780
But you'll make films only for me.

1310
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,820
Whether anyone likes it or not,
but I should like it.

1311
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:34,900
That way you will be my hero.

1312
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,650
Your hero is Ranbir Kapoor.

1313
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:42,360
But he's out of my reach.

1314
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:45,450
But you are not.

1315
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,950
I'll have to settle for you.

1316
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,400
"9th July."

1317
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,990
"No one can do what
Anu did for me today."

1318
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:11,360
"I think Anu can do anything for me..."

1319
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:14,700
Maithili, get dressed and come down.

1320
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:18,030
And please dress properly.

1321
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,650
- She aced her exams with merit.
- I see...

1322
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:23,780
Maithili was visiting the temple.

1323
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:25,990
And a miracle occurred.

1324
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:27,650
Here you go, mister.

1325
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,490
So Charandas.

1326
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:34,700
It's not an easy job to score 73%
marks while handling all the chores.

1327
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,030
Here you go, son.

1328
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:37,280
She worked really hard.

1329
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,320
Have one.

1330
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:39,490
Just one.

1331
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:41,700
Then let's decide on a wedding date.

1332
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,740
Listen...come here.

1333
01:06:58,820 --> 01:06:59,950
- Kurban.
- Maithali.

1334
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:01,360
Why is Anu's number unreachable?

1335
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,450
He fell sick yesterday
after he met you.

1336
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,570
He's down with fever and cold.

1337
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:07,820
Cold...

1338
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:09,360
I see...

1339
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:10,200
And...

1340
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:18,320
"I surrender my heart to you..."

1341
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:23,570
Where can I find Anu Sharma?

1342
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:27,950
Anu Sharma?

1343
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:30,240
What do you want with him?

1344
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:35,780
I...I want to talk to him.

1345
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:37,950
- It was personal.
- I am his friend.

1346
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:41,450
Please tell me if know where he lives.

1347
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:43,150
I don't have too long.

1348
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:45,990
Anything wrong?

1349
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,990
No. Nothing wrong.

1350
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,740
I am his girlfriend.

1351
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:51,150
I see...

1352
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:52,700
Since when?

1353
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,740
I guess you're one of those friends
whom Anu doesn't tell anything.

1354
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,450
That's not true. That's not true.

1355
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:02,450
Come. Come with me.
Come on.

1356
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:09,780
How are you?

1357
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,070
You?

1358
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,490
I've been trying to
call you since last night.

1359
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:16,530
Your friend brought me home.

1360
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:18,110
Which friend?

1361
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:19,740
Him.

1362
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,450
Oh, God.

1363
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:25,570
By the way, I am Anu's dad.

1364
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:27,530
Sit. Sit.

1365
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:30,490
He's never done anything
to make me feel like a father, so...

1366
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,490
...you don't have to be formal either.

1367
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,200
Give him this medicine.

1368
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,070
Your love mixed with this medicine
will cure his fever instantly.

1369
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:39,280
Please.

1370
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,700
- You want me to...
- Yes, of course.

1371
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:52,990
Anu, it wasn't easy
for me to come here.

1372
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:58,150
I wanted to talk to him in private.

1373
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,740
- She's trying to tell you to leave.
- I get it.

1374
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:04,860
I am getting married next month.

1375
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:07,990
- Papa.
- Yeah.

1376
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:10,610
What?

1377
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:11,950
Her father...

1378
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:14,360
I am getting married next month.

1379
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,450
I will talk to your father.
Not a problem.

1380
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:18,900
No-no, not you.

1381
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,400
He hates filmy people.

1382
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,780
He hates filmy people.
Then he won't like you one bit.

1383
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,030
This red one is nice as well.

1384
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:31,740
No, no, I'll get one from Beneras.

1385
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:32,740
Show me something really nice.

1386
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:35,030
Then how about this one in yellow.
This one's pretty nice as well.

1387
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:36,780
Where were you?

1388
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:37,860
Come sit.

1389
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:39,950
Sit.

1390
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:42,150
Look at these beautiful saris.

1391
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:43,900
What is all this?

1392
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:44,990
This is for you.

1393
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:47,610
- Look how beautiful...
- Why are you doing all this?

1394
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:49,150
For you, dear.

1395
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:51,570
How about this red one?

1396
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:57,900
I don't want any of this.

1397
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:58,990
Take it back.

1398
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:00,200
Don't buy any of this.

1399
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:01,450
Please leave.

1400
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,240
No.

1401
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:12,900
Papa...

1402
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:15,740
Son..

1403
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:19,240
I swear I'll stop
being so melodramatic.

1404
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,320
Swear on God.

1405
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:24,030
This understanding that we have...

1406
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,740
...I don't think any father-son
has that.

1407
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:29,320
Please, don't go.

1408
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:30,820
Please.

1409
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,030
I've already made up my mind.

1410
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:33,530
I am not leaving forever.

1411
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:35,950
Of course not.
We're throwing you out of here.

1412
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:37,320
If anyone finds out...

1413
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,490
...then people will lose faith
in the father-son relationship.

1414
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:44,610
Our relationship is an
example for the world, father!

1415
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:45,740
That's true.

1416
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:48,110
Just a minute.

1417
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:50,950
What the...

1418
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:52,900
I mean the boy's
eloping with the girl...

1419
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:54,400
...and you expect the family
to stay quiet. You deserve one.

1420
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:56,360
- What was that?
- You deserve one.

1421
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:58,650
I've done my duty by slapping you.
Go take your mother's blessings.

1422
01:10:58,740 --> 01:10:59,820
Go on.

1423
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,110
Doesn't matter where you go,
but don't go to Mumbai.

1424
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:03,950
I am warning you.

1425
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:08,990
Go to Mumbai.

1426
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:10,900
No other place will do.

1427
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,570
And don't do anything wrong.

1428
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,450
And don't get beaten up.

1429
01:11:16,990 --> 01:11:17,860
Shobha.

1430
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:18,860
Shobha.

1431
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,610
Please tell me how
did he become so tall.

1432
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:23,570
Oh, God.

1433
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:26,490
Be careful.

1434
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:27,570
Papa...

1435
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:31,110
I've had this question in my mind
since the time you were born.

1436
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,280
Let's go. Let's go.

1437
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:08,280
Come on.

1438
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,820
There they are.

1439
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:25,900
Anu.

1440
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,200
Stop.

1441
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:32,610
Maithali's there too.

1442
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:35,030
Hurry up.

1443
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:36,900
Get the other boat too.

1444
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:38,650
Maithali.

1445
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:40,650
Maithali.

1446
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,400
You will have to pay
for this with your life.

1447
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,490
Stop, dear.

1448
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,490
Go on. Go.

1449
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:51,780
We'll get you.

1450
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:54,570
There's nowhere to go.

1451
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:56,610
Maithili.

1452
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:59,360
Listen to me, dear.

1453
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:01,360
Maithali.

1454
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,240
Come on.

1455
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,780
- Jump. Jump.
- Run.

1456
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,650
Catch him.

1457
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:13,280
Maithali.

1458
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,700
Anu!

1459
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:19,860
Anu!

1460
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:21,360
Come with me. Come on.

1461
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,540
What are you all looking at?

1462
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:56,450
This is not a film.

1463
01:13:57,290 --> 01:13:58,330
Go back inside.

1464
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,160
Rascals.

1465
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,910
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- What?

1466
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,080
This is our personal matter.

1467
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,450
- So what?
- Get them out of here.

1468
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,290
- What are doing?
- Sushila.

1469
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:10,580
You won't raise your hand on her.
And I mean it.

1470
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,040
She is a grownup now.

1471
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:12,950
Wait.

1472
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:15,700
You never thought even once...

1473
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:20,370
...how the world's going to look down
on me and you after this.

1474
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:25,040
Now this door will stay closed
until I say otherwise.

1475
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:45,450
Try to understand
my situation as well.

1476
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:50,120
Charandas will never be able to
look anyone in the eye again.

1477
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,000
Even I will have to face humiliation
for the rest of my life, Mr. Shukla.

1478
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:56,580
But none of this is our fault.

1479
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:06,290
Just tell me what can be the
solution to this problem.

1480
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:08,950
I am prepared to give more dowry
if required.

1481
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:12,950
Janardhan, all we can offer you now
Is our sympathy.

1482
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:14,500
Not a proposal.

1483
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:05,290
The client's asked
for four kilos of mutton.

1484
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:06,160
Okay.

1485
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,290
The best ones.

1486
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:08,660
Lord...

1487
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:10,790
Kurban.

1488
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:12,830
Kurban, let's go.

1489
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,330
Shut the shop and let's go down.

1490
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:15,250
Why? What's wrong?

1491
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:17,500
Are dreams are coming true?

1492
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,120
A film unit has come
down here from Mumbai.

1493
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,660
And they are making
a feature film here.

1494
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,830
I won't shut shop for film,
or anything else.

1495
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:24,790
It's in the newspaper,
they require local artists.

1496
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:27,410
Even after wasting 4 years
you didn't learn anything.

1497
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,500
Art and Culture.

1498
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:29,910
I was so emotional.

1499
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:32,160
For a brief moment
I felt pity for them.

1500
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,040
But I smartened up at the right time.

1501
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,290
I am over this acting business.

1502
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:36,330
And you should...

1503
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:39,000
They are holding auditions for
character artists in Hotel Kanha-Shyam.

1504
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:46,790
Keep him back.

1505
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:49,200
And hand me my shirt.

1506
01:16:49,290 --> 01:16:51,540
And listen,
we should go completely prepared.

1507
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:52,910
First, we'll write an application.

1508
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,950
"To the director, "so-so" production.

1509
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,160
And we'll write it
on our own letterhead.

1510
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:57,620
Get the letterhead.

1511
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:03,870
It's covered in dust.

1512
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:13,830
Hello, hello. Hi.

1513
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:16,120
- Hi.
- Myself Deepak Mishra.

1514
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:17,450
Amar Ujala.

1515
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:18,950
We would like to meet the director.

1516
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:21,040
We'll meet the press
at the press conference, sir.

1517
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,080
No, no, we're not from the press.

1518
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,370
- We are actors.
- We're artists.

1519
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:26,450
- Show them our picture.
- Look here.

1520
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:27,870
This queue is for auditions.

1521
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:30,620
Everyone's waiting for their turn.
Please wait, and I'll call you.

1522
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:32,080
- This is Allahabad.
- You don't get it.

1523
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,870
A famous artist who hails from here
once said...

1524
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:36,080
"The line starts from where I stand..."

1525
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:46,830
What to do?
The place is so crowded.

1526
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:47,870
Seems like the entire
city has come down.

1527
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:49,750
And even we have to stand in a queue.

1528
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,160
Even the hotel guys are auditioning.

1529
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:58,580
Anu?

1530
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,830
- I am the director...of this film.
- Director?

1531
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:11,830
How?

1532
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,790
What?

1533
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,620
- Where the hell were you?
- I will tell you everything.

1534
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,660
Do you have any idea about
what happened after you left?

1535
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:22,500
A lot happened.

1536
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:24,040
And I will tell you all.

1537
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,330
Amar Ujala.

1538
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:41,790
Really?

1539
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Phattu.

1540
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,540
Why didn't you call, you rascal?

1541
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,080
I have a lot to tell you.

1542
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:54,450
Let's talk in the evening.

1543
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:55,790
Okay.

1544
01:18:58,160 --> 01:18:59,660
Babli, are you sure you saw Anu?

1545
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:01,250
Yes. That was Anu.

1546
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:02,750
How can I forget his face?

1547
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:05,200
He was in Civil Lines taking pictures.

1548
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:18,410
- Yes?
- Where can we find Anirudh Sharma?

1549
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,040
Please ask them.

1550
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:25,040
Where can we find Anirudh Sharma?

1551
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:31,910
- Here?
- Yes.

1552
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:34,330
Wait here. I'll be right back.

1553
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:35,950
Okay.

1554
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,750
- Let's go inside.
- As I said I don't know Marathi...

1555
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,040
Sir.

1556
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,450
Sir.

1557
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,790
The TC made him get off
the train at Igatpuri station.

1558
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:17,870
He has no ticket.

1559
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:19,120
And he has an injured arm.

1560
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:27,120
Where is your ticket?

1561
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:29,000
How did you get hurt?

1562
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,790
Sir...i feel asleep.

1563
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:33,250
I'll catch the first
train back to Allahabad.

1564
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:36,950
- This is just a minor...
- Do you think you own the place?

1565
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:38,790
Where do these guys come from?

1566
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:40,910
They increase Mumbai's population,
Crime rate...

1567
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,910
- ...and we've to work overtime.
- I don't know Marathi, I've been trying to...

1568
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
This is Marathi.

1569
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:46,870
Sir.

1570
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:48,330
What have I done?

1571
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:50,580
Let me go.

1572
01:20:54,370 --> 01:20:56,500
Sir...Sir...Sir...

1573
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:04,370
They kept me locked up for 12 days
without any trial.

1574
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:08,910
I called papa immediately
after I got out.

1575
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:13,250
Papa said that Maithili got married.

1576
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:17,580
What could I do?

1577
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:22,250
I told him not to
tell anyone about me.

1578
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:23,700
I don't see any point in that.

1579
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,000
I was already in Mumbai.

1580
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,540
I wanted to work in films.

1581
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:29,950
I knew my job.

1582
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,410
So I stayed back.

1583
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:39,200
You're making that sound so easy,
I stayed back.

1584
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:41,250
Do you have any clue about
what happened here after you left?

1585
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:43,620
Maithili got married to a goon.

1586
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:44,620
Guru Panda.

1587
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:48,000
Do you believe that I was
having a good time in Mumbai?

1588
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:52,790
I wanted to forget her.

1589
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,370
So I didn't come back.

1590
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:00,290
And you forgot her.

1591
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,700
That's why you came back.

1592
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,080
I returned, all right.

1593
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,830
But I haven't forgotten her.

1594
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:24,790
Anu.

1595
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,120
Why are you crying?

1596
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,080
I've told you not to drink here.

1597
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:48,040
The room starts to stink.

1598
01:22:57,660 --> 01:22:59,120
This is not how the
room begins to stink.

1599
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:02,450
This is how it stinks.

1600
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:03,870
What do you think you're doing?

1601
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,120
Are you out of your mind?

1602
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:09,830
Now the place is going to stink.

1603
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:12,500
Now it will stink.

1604
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:15,250
Like this.

1605
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:17,290
Now it will stink.

1606
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,120
Now it will stink.

1607
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:22,790
What are you doing?

1608
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:37,910
- Hail Mahadev!
- Hail Mahadev!

1609
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,250
Babli's here. Babli's here.

1610
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,870
Come on. We've arrived at the temple.

1611
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,000
Come on.

1612
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:48,200
- Hail Mahadev!
- Hail Mahadev!

1613
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:49,790
Meet us at the flower shop now.

1614
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:51,200
- But...
- What's keeping you?

1615
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:52,410
Coming.

1616
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,870
- Hail Mahadev!
- Hail Mahadev!

1617
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:57,250
Listen, I forgot to get flowers.

1618
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:59,540
- I'll be back in a jiffy.
- Okay, but hurry up.

1619
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:01,540
Come on. Let's go buy flowers.

1620
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,160
No, Babli.

1621
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:11,040
Honestly, Anu still loves Maithali.

1622
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,580
He said that to me personally.

1623
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:16,120
And we all know that Maithili isn't
too happy with her marriage either.

1624
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:19,160
Fine. I will tell her.

1625
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:22,000
- Mister, give me some flowers.
- Are you happy?

1626
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,790
- Otherwise...
- I am very happy.

1627
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:25,040
Now please leave.

1628
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,790
Will your son tell
brother-in-law any of this?

1629
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:30,040
He has started to speak yet.

1630
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:30,830
I see...

1631
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:33,370
Son, repeat after
me...Maithili loves Anu.

1632
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:35,080
Say it, son.
Say it.

1633
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:48,620
I wish you had waited a little longer.

1634
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:51,660
Then maybe Anu and
you would've been together.

1635
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,450
You two could've been together.

1636
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:56,290
It wasn't my decision to make.

1637
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:02,040
What's done is done.

1638
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:04,620
This is my life,
and I will deal with it.

1639
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:10,450
Just tell to forgive me
and forget everything.

1640
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:22,040
Why are you crying?

1641
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,660
Because I haven't forgotten
him either, Babli.

1642
01:25:31,410 --> 01:25:33,580
I have my entire life ahead of me.

1643
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:38,450
And I cannot spend
it with this drunken idiot.

1644
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:47,120
I want to meet him, Babli.

1645
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,950
You shouldn't forget
that you're married.

1646
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,620
Stay back. Stay back, son.

1647
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,330
Babli's calling.

1648
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:02,580
Hello.

1649
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:05,620
Fine, hold on.

1650
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,660
Anu, call for you.

1651
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:11,950
- Who is it?
- It's a girl.

1652
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:15,660
- Who is this?
- Maithili speaking, Anu.

1653
01:26:23,790 --> 01:26:24,870
How are you, Maithili?

1654
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,750
I want to meet you.

1655
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,450
So you can slap me on the other cheek?

1656
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:32,160
No. To apologize.

1657
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:34,200
I've already forgiven you.

1658
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:41,250
The way you say that, makes it sound
like you've forgotten all about me.

1659
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:45,120
No, no, how is that possible?

1660
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,330
Can you see me?

1661
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:51,500
I am on the roof of my house.
Right here.

1662
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:56,830
Yes.

1663
01:26:57,290 --> 01:26:58,500
Where are you?

1664
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,450
Do you see that shining light?

1665
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:06,410
See?

1666
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:14,870
Anu, I want to make another...mistake.

1667
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:20,330
Yes.

1668
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,540
I did commit that murder.

1669
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,080
But, what's the point now?

1670
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:28,370
Soon I will find all the evidence.

1671
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:32,330
And then, I will rip the
life out of you, whatever is left.

1672
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:33,450
Cut. Cut. Cut...

1673
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:34,750
That midget...

1674
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:35,660
Hey, midget.

1675
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:37,120
What are you doing?

1676
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,080
Why is your shirt unbuttoned?
Button it up.

1677
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,290
Who is this guy? Who is this guy?

1678
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,410
Hello, brother.

1679
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:46,540
Who is he?

1680
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,040
You don't know.

1681
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,160
I've invested money too.

1682
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:52,120
Come, come.

1683
01:27:52,330 --> 01:27:53,870
Enough, enough.

1684
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:58,250
I heard in the newspaper that
there's a film crew in the city.

1685
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,080
So I bailed myself out immediately.

1686
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:04,370
So, what role do
you have in mind for me?

1687
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:06,830
Brother,
there are no roles left for you.

1688
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:10,540
- They are all very small roles.
- Shut up.

1689
01:28:11,950 --> 01:28:13,450
And stop yapping your mouth.

1690
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:16,330
Rascal.

1691
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:19,370
I didn't bail myself out
of jail to do smalltime roles!

1692
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:25,330
What is that midget doing here?

1693
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:26,620
Hello, brother.

1694
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:29,580
Okay?

1695
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:30,250
No worries.

1696
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:32,450
I mean come on, look at these people.

1697
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,870
Maithili is coming
to meet you tomorrow.

1698
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:40,700
Anu's girlfriend. Coming tomorrow.

1699
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:42,160
Here. Coming tomorrow.

1700
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,410
No kissing.

1701
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,620
The film crew will shoot around
various locations in Allahabad.

1702
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,910
Films are a dirty business.

1703
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:03,500
This film will be directed by
Anirudh Sharma.

1704
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:08,160
Anirudh aka Anu hails from this city...

1705
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:12,370
Guru, could it be him?

1706
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:15,870
Is he back in the city?

1707
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:19,040
Finally...he's awake.

1708
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,870
Why do you drink so much?

1709
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,580
And even if you do,
then drink the better stuff.

1710
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:29,750
Come here.

1711
01:29:32,290 --> 01:29:33,500
- Come on.
- What?

1712
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:34,950
Why are you always so stiff?

1713
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,000
Come here.

1714
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:44,120
Cheap alcohol and cheap sex
do more harm than good.

1715
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,700
Get my point.

1716
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,120
Maithili.

1717
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:57,330
- Maithili.
- Babli, you're all dressed up.

1718
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:58,620
Where are you going?

1719
01:29:58,700 --> 01:29:59,580
Its Monday.

1720
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,370
So we're going to the temple.

1721
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:06,250
Why don't you pray
for me as well sometimes?

1722
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:08,500
Since you are already married.

1723
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:10,750
Let me know if you
have someone on your mind.

1724
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,870
I'll pray for you too

1725
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,870
How...

1726
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,370
Tell me.

1727
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:20,080
What's wrong with your uncle?

1728
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:21,830
Bye.

1729
01:30:24,290 --> 01:30:25,500
Where is Maithali going?

1730
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:27,500
- To the temple?
- What temple?

1731
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:29,080
Haven't you read the newspaper?

1732
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,830
You two have been
married for three years...

1733
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:34,500
...and yet Maithili has no children.

1734
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,870
She has gone to the Shiv Temple,
with my permission.

1735
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:38,700
Don't doubt her.

1736
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,040
Rickshaw.

1737
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:45,000
- The Residency.
- Come.

1738
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,450
Come on. Let's go.

1739
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:02,620
Stop here.

1740
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:08,870
What's going on here?

1741
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,250
So this is a shooting?

1742
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:12,950
Oh, God. Look at all the people.

1743
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:15,500
Take that thing inside.

1744
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:16,500
Yes.

1745
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:19,200
We'll need 24,000 for those fittings up there.

1746
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:21,290
Maithili's here.

1747
01:31:21,830 --> 01:31:23,160
You know what, you take care inside...

1748
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:24,410
...and I will handle them.

1749
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,160
You guys are here.

1750
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:28,250
You know what...

1751
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:30,000
Come here. Come on.

1752
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,040
All these people in a Burkha.

1753
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,000
You two are in a burka as well.

1754
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,750
You see, we're shooting
a wedding scene today.

1755
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:39,500
Come, sit. Come on.

1756
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:42,450
Wait here, I'll call Anu.

1757
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:44,910
Don't go anywhere.
I will be right back with him.

1758
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:46,870
- The actor has a flight to catch.
- Phattu...

1759
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:48,790
- How are we going to do this?
- Phattu...

1760
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,120
- Where is Anu?
- In the van.

1761
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:51,700
Come with me. Come on.

1762
01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:54,500
- Come on.
- Come on, everyone. Hurry up.

1763
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:57,790
What are you two doing here?

1764
01:31:57,870 --> 01:31:59,200
Everyone's waiting.
Get up.

1765
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:00,580
But we thought...

1766
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:02,540
Would you know better, or me?

1767
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:04,620
Come on, get up.

1768
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:08,000
- Don't worry.
- You guys are still here.

1769
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,370
Hurry up.

1770
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:15,040
This is where I left them.

1771
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:16,290
This is where I left them.

1772
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:17,830
Swear on my mom.
She was right here.

1773
01:32:17,910 --> 01:32:19,120
Even I can see that.

1774
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,120
Where can she go?

1775
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:24,040
I made a promise, and won't
give up until you two don't meet.

1776
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:25,120
Don't you worry?

1777
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:27,410
Anu... I have a flight to catch.

1778
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:28,790
Is the shot ready?

1779
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,500
Yes...come on.

1780
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:31,540
Ready.

1781
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:47,000
Go sit next to the groom.

1782
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,000
The clergy will read.

1783
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,040
Take the glasses off.

1784
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:50,000
Come on.

1785
01:32:50,370 --> 01:32:51,410
Yes, from right here.
Track it.

1786
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:53,000
On the groom.

1787
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:54,040
Okay.

1788
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:55,330
Roll sound.

1789
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:57,330
Action.

1790
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:01,080
Where the hell are we?

1791
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:03,790
Don't get nervous,
and make me nervous too.

1792
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:04,500
Nervous.

1793
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:05,540
I am getting nervous.

1794
01:33:05,790 --> 01:33:06,580
Calm down.

1795
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:09,580
- Be quiet.
- Silence.

1796
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:11,330
Who is talking?
What is going on here?

1797
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:12,910
They are saying action.

1798
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,410
Silence. You two are talking so much.

1799
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:18,080
- Mind your own business, you fake bride.
- Be quiet.

1800
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:20,200
And action.

1801
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:21,870
- What are we doing?
- Cut-Cut-Cut...

1802
01:33:21,950 --> 01:33:23,000
We came here wearing this burkha.

1803
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:23,750
Why happened?

1804
01:33:23,870 --> 01:33:24,790
Who is talking?

1805
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,580
Who is talking here?

1806
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:27,950
You. You two.

1807
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,250
Throw them out.

1808
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:30,250
Get up.
- But...

1809
01:33:30,330 --> 01:33:32,830
I said get up.
Come on, go out.

1810
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:34,790
See...I told you.

1811
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,080
Be quiet.
- You sit here.

1812
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:40,790
Listen, Maithili.

1813
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:42,500
Maithili.

1814
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:45,540
I am trying to say something.

1815
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:47,290
I know him too well.

1816
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:50,750
He won't say it directly
that he hates me.

1817
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,450
But embarrass me instead.

1818
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:53,700
That Anu is playing games with me...

1819
01:33:53,790 --> 01:33:55,120
...because I slapped him.

1820
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,370
This is his revenge, Babli.

1821
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:59,160
- He's calling.
- Who is it?

1822
01:33:59,410 --> 01:34:00,120
Kurban.

1823
01:34:00,290 --> 01:34:01,200
Listen...

1824
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:04,000
- Babli, where are you two?
- Listen, Kurban...

1825
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:04,950
What happened?

1826
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,540
Who do you think we are?

1827
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:07,750
I came looking for you.

1828
01:34:07,830 --> 01:34:10,000
You called us to humiliate us,
didn't you?

1829
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,540
No, I...

1830
01:34:13,830 --> 01:34:16,040
You will delete the
numbers of all his friends.

1831
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,160
- Now.
- I am doing it.

1832
01:34:17,450 --> 01:34:19,330
We've nothing to
do with him any longer.

1833
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:20,450
Not at all.

1834
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,660
- And you won't give me any of his messages.
- Okay.

1835
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:26,950
- Understand.
- Yes, I do.

1836
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,410
- Don't be so upset.
- Let's go.

1837
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:29,600
- Listen...
- Come on.

1838
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:29,830
- Listen...
- Come on.
A heartfelt apology letter
from film Director Anirudh Sharma.

1839
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:33,600
A heartfelt apology letter
from film Director Anirudh Sharma.

1840
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:35,100
Heartfelt.

1841
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:39,020
The film director has admitted
his mistake and claimed...

1842
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:43,730
...that we often end up hurting the
sentiments of people during shooting.

1843
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:45,850
He's a sly guy, sister.

1844
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:47,730
You never met him.

1845
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:49,270
What else...

1846
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:52,480
He said that he angered
someone yesterday...

1847
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:56,600
...and I felt so embarrassed
that it's affecting my work.

1848
01:34:56,850 --> 01:34:58,440
What an imposter.

1849
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:02,560
I can't get rid of the thought
that I hurt the sentiments...

1850
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:06,850
...of that person who
came to meet only me.

1851
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:08,400
What a rascal.

1852
01:35:09,310 --> 01:35:11,100
Keep the phone down
and concentrate on the food.

1853
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:12,230
Fine.

1854
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:19,520
Babli, please let me talk to Anu.

1855
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,980
I deleted all the numbers
because you said so.

1856
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:23,730
I don't remember any of it.

1857
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:25,060
What's the matter?

1858
01:35:25,770 --> 01:35:27,520
Getting emotional after
your anger calmed down.

1859
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,940
It was all my fault.

1860
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:31,480
He's even printed an apology
letter in the newspaper.

1861
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:34,810
Babli, please do
this one thing for me.

1862
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:36,520
I will never ask you
to do anything again.

1863
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,270
Please.

1864
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,060
What? Tell me.

1865
01:35:49,770 --> 01:35:51,850
"Happy Holi."

1866
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:01,900
"My t-shirt's purple, sweetheart..."

1867
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:04,980
"...while your stole's yellow."

1868
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:11,850
"Turn your gaze and look at me."

1869
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:22,940
"My t-shirt's purple, sweetheart..."

1870
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:25,940
"...while your stole's yellow."

1871
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:32,980
"Turn your gaze and look at me."

1872
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:35,190
"The color of your lipstick..."

1873
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:39,980
"...is casting a spell on me,
slowly-slowly."

1874
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:43,480
"Don't mind today because its Holi."

1875
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:46,900
"Don't mind today because its Holi."

1876
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:50,440
"Don't mind today because its Holi."

1877
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:54,400
"Don't mind today because its Holi."

1878
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:08,770
"Why do you keep smothering
colours only...on me."

1879
01:37:11,730 --> 01:37:15,440
"This is my chance,
and the situation calls for it..."

1880
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:19,650
"...and a little flirting is okay."

1881
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:25,560
"I'll give you a warm welcome,
sweetheart."

1882
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:28,940
"Because I've dipped
my sandals in color."

1883
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:32,480
"Don't mind today, because its Holi."

1884
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:36,060
"Don't mind today, because its Holi."

1885
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:39,520
"Don't mind today, because its Holi."

1886
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,480
"Don't mind today, because its Holi."

1887
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,940
"It's holi...so no dieting."

1888
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:58,440
"Let me offer you a sweetmeat
laced and get you high."

1889
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,480
"Let it be..."

1890
01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:08,350
"...I am sure your
mother paid for these."

1891
01:38:11,150 --> 01:38:14,440
"Your tone is rude,
but your face is cute."

1892
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:18,020
"Everyone's going crazy."

1893
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:21,600
"Don't mind today, because its Holi."

1894
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:25,020
"Don't mind today, because its Holi."

1895
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:28,600
"Don't mind today, because its Holi."

1896
01:38:28,690 --> 01:38:32,100
"Don't mind today, because its Holi."

1897
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:35,730
"Don't mind today, because its Holi."

1898
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:39,100
"Don't mind today, because its Holi."

1899
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:42,520
"Don't mind today, because its Holi."

1900
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:46,770
"Don't mind today, because its Holi."

1901
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:51,310
- Move. Move.
- Wait. Who are you?

1902
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:53,310
- I want to meet with him.
- Let her through.

1903
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:54,690
Let her.

1904
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,980
- Babli...
- Anu, it's Maithili.

1905
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:03,600
Stop, Maithili. Stop.

1906
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:05,850
Anu, please get me out of this hell,
please.

1907
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:06,650
I...

1908
01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:09,190
I want to start all over again, Anu.

1909
01:39:09,690 --> 01:39:11,520
And with you.

1910
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,520
I will get the best lawyer.

1911
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:17,810
We'll get your divorce papers ready.

1912
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:21,770
- Anu...
- Enough, Maithili.

1913
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:24,730
I am there.

1914
01:39:25,270 --> 01:39:26,810
And I am promising you.

1915
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,100
I will take you away from this hell.

1916
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:34,350
254...

1917
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:35,770
Is that his Mumbai's number.

1918
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:37,190
Of course.

1919
01:39:37,730 --> 01:39:38,690
Listen...

1920
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:39,480
What?

1921
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:42,150
The heroine was getting
too close to Anu.

1922
01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:45,350
Anu sir, am I looking good?

1923
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:47,440
Anu sir, this...

1924
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:48,440
Anu sir...

1925
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:49,230
Babli.

1926
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:56,770
You thought I will never find out about
the love story brewing behind my back.

1927
01:39:57,270 --> 01:39:58,310
Give that to me.

1928
01:39:58,480 --> 01:39:59,100
What...

1929
01:39:59,850 --> 01:40:00,810
Leave that alone.

1930
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:02,770
Shut up. I will slap you.

1931
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:04,230
I... I...

1932
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:05,900
- Let me go.
- Guru!

1933
01:40:05,980 --> 01:40:07,100
Do you want a slap?

1934
01:40:07,190 --> 01:40:08,650
- Shut up.
- I haven't done anything.

1935
01:40:09,190 --> 01:40:10,770
- Let me go.
- Get out.

1936
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:13,310
- I said get out.
- Guru.

1937
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,480
And don't let me catch you here again.

1938
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:16,730
- Babli...
- What's the matter?

1939
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:18,520
- Where do you think you're going?
- Hey...

1940
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:22,770
Don't raise your hand on her.

1941
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:27,020
You're her husband, and
you have every right to.

1942
01:40:27,650 --> 01:40:29,100
But I am her father.

1943
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,060
I won't endure it.

1944
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:31,980
I see...

1945
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,400
My wife's writing
love-letters to her old lover...

1946
01:40:36,850 --> 01:40:38,060
...and I shall do nothing.

1947
01:40:38,150 --> 01:40:40,810
What evidence do you have
that she wrote a letter to her?

1948
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:43,400
I saw Babli taking the letter!

1949
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:45,900
I went to the shooting!

1950
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:48,940
And you want evidence,
don't you?

1951
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:50,940
It's all in here.

1952
01:40:51,810 --> 01:40:52,940
Now listen.

1953
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,190
8th October, meaning 8 days ago.

1954
01:40:57,150 --> 01:40:59,310
Today I met with Anu
in Hotel Kanha Shyam.

1955
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:02,600
- All those old memories were refreshed.
- Enough!

1956
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:04,900
No need to read ahead.

1957
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:07,400
She has also described various
methods to deliver the letter.

1958
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:09,350
In the newspaper.

1959
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:12,060
Kite...
Where do you think you're going?

1960
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:14,060
- Tied to a kite.
- Let her go.

1961
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:15,440
Let me finish first.

1962
01:41:16,310 --> 01:41:21,810
You can take lessons from this
book on how to humiliate someone.

1963
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:33,060
- Oh, so she's married.
- Yes, sir.

1964
01:41:33,690 --> 01:41:35,650
She has been married for 3 years.

1965
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,400
But she is not happy.

1966
01:41:38,810 --> 01:41:40,650
Her husband is very violent.

1967
01:41:41,150 --> 01:41:42,440
Any children?

1968
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:44,270
No children.

1969
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:45,600
No...

1970
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:49,310
- What does her husband do?
- He's a hooligan.

1971
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:51,020
Shot ready.

1972
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:52,770
Yeah...
Just a minute.

1973
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:55,310
Ready.
Start sound.

1974
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:56,440
Rolling.

1975
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,440
And...Action!

1976
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,980
Catch that rascal.

1977
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:08,310
Who are those guys at the back?

1978
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,150
Who are they?

1979
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:11,440
Who are they?
What...

1980
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:14,980
Anu?

1981
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:16,350
Stop.

1982
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:19,350
I am going to break everyone's head.

1983
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:28,150
Take my advice and stop whatever
is brewing between you two.

1984
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:31,060
Don't forget that she lives with me.

1985
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:33,940
I will choke her
to death in her sleep.

1986
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:37,020
Really?

1987
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,770
Anu.

1988
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:51,810
- Get the car.
- I'm done with this humiliation.

1989
01:42:52,690 --> 01:42:56,440
I made sure that he lands straight in the
hospital and no one could be saved him.

1990
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:59,020
Neither the Police or his lads.

1991
01:42:59,230 --> 01:43:01,440
He fell flat on the ground.

1992
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:04,600
Yeah...

1993
01:43:04,940 --> 01:43:07,100
And remember one thing.

1994
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:11,770
If you try to forge
a bond with that guy again...

1995
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:13,940
...right now he's in the hospital,

1996
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:18,270
but I will burn him alive.

1997
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:20,810
In front of your eyes.

1998
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:32,900
We will not spare
Guru Panda this time.

1999
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:35,810
No one's going to do anything.
This matter is closed.

2000
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:37,310
- You just wait and watch.
- ...is that clear.

2001
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,270
The crowd watching the
shooting turned violent...

2002
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:41,100
...and created a racket...

2003
01:43:41,190 --> 01:43:42,100
You are his friend.

2004
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:44,560
- How is Anu Sharma now?
- He isn't dead.

2005
01:43:44,650 --> 01:43:45,440
Tell us something.

2006
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:46,690
And, whoever did this...

2007
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:48,850
...I want to tell them that
he will recover soon...

2008
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:51,100
...and finish his shooting.

2009
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:59,560
The toilet's downstairs.

2010
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:00,400
What?

2011
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:02,350
I am Maithili's friend.

2012
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:04,150
I have a message for Anu.

2013
01:44:04,350 --> 01:44:06,980
Please tell him that Maithili
will never see him again.

2014
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:19,730
"I made tall claims
when we were in love."

2015
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:24,650
"But this distance made me realize..."

2016
01:44:25,150 --> 01:44:29,940
"...what you mean to me."

2017
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:44,480
"I made tall claims
when we were in love."

2018
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:49,690
"But this distance made me realize..."

2019
01:44:50,270 --> 01:44:54,600
"...what you mean to me."

2020
01:44:55,310 --> 01:45:04,520
"Once we separated I understood
the value of love."

2021
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:11,850
"I will love no one else,
I made this pact with myself."

2022
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:13,440
And cut.

2023
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,560
It's a wrap.
Is that wrap for good.

2024
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:19,600
- Yes, sir.
- Congratulations.

2025
01:45:19,690 --> 01:45:21,350
You did a good job.
Great job.

2026
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:22,600
I really have to appreciate that.

2027
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:26,020
Great job.

2028
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:29,100
Our efforts will bear fruit.

2029
01:45:29,190 --> 01:45:30,440
The film will be a hit.

2030
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:33,770
Whether the film is a hit or a flop,
but life should always be a hit.

2031
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:41,270
And life's Super hit when you get what you
wanted from the bottom of your heart.

2032
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:43,940
You should close
this chapter for good.

2033
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:44,900
And let her go.

2034
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:47,400
Is she a bad habit that I can quit?

2035
01:45:48,650 --> 01:45:52,270
I must have done something,
that she came in my life.

2036
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:56,600
She is my reward for my good deeds.

2037
01:45:57,060 --> 01:45:59,310
I cannot forget her.
Never.

2038
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:00,600
It's impossible.

2039
01:46:01,190 --> 01:46:04,690
- Communication with Maithili is impossible.
- No. Never.

2040
01:46:04,770 --> 01:46:06,900
- We beg you.
- I know. I know.

2041
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:11,060
But if she sees my film just once.

2042
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:12,980
That's it.

2043
01:46:18,150 --> 01:46:19,270
The film's almost over.

2044
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:24,190
Are you leaving?

2045
01:46:31,770 --> 01:46:34,650
- Sister is the breakfast ready.
- The film crew wrapped up their...

2046
01:46:34,810 --> 01:46:36,150
...shooting yesterday.

2047
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:44,310
After shooting for 40 days around the
city, the unit of the film 'Saabit'...

2048
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:46,650
...left for Mumbai...

2049
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:51,730
Traffic Jam on Shashtri Bridge.

2050
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:58,150
You won my heart.

2051
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:01,100
And you're leaving now.

2052
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:03,440
You will forget all about me,
But I won't.

2053
01:47:03,730 --> 01:47:06,400
Dude, I will never forget this favor.

2054
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:10,310
Once the movie releases,
then I am a cinch in for MLA.

2055
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:14,060
Listen...don't forget.

2056
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:15,060
Let's go.

2057
01:47:15,350 --> 01:47:16,600
Hop in, brother.

2058
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:19,060
Give it to me.

2059
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:21,940
What's in it?

2060
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,480
I am Anu's dad.

2061
01:47:24,650 --> 01:47:25,690
Hello, uncle.

2062
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:28,060
Where did you buy this shirt?

2063
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,900
I just want Maithili
to see my film once.

2064
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:33,850
That will be the proper
end of this story.

2065
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:35,400
What do you mean?

2066
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:39,690
Brother Kaptan, let's go.

2067
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:17,940
Good news. Good news. Good news.

2068
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:21,440
It's time to rejoice and celebrate.

2069
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:26,230
Releasing this Friday
in Milan Talkies...

2070
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:30,770
...is the film made
by our very own hometown

2071
01:48:30,850 --> 01:48:34,940
Star director, Saabit.

2072
01:49:10,230 --> 01:49:11,770
Fantastic. Fantastic.

2073
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:15,230
- You look amazing brother Kaptan.
- Did you buy the ticket or not?

2074
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:17,310
Of course, I bought the tickets.

2075
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:18,810
I booked half the hall.

2076
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:21,400
- Long Live...
- Sangam Arts.

2077
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:23,310
Go ahead, brother Usman.

2078
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:00,690
Boss...

2079
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:02,310
I know, I know...

2080
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:13,020
"Catch him."

2081
01:50:13,650 --> 01:50:15,940
- My face is hardly visible.
- Maybe later on.

2082
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:22,690
Popcorn.

2083
01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:34,440
"Happy Holi..."

2084
01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:44,400
"My t-shirt's purple, sweetheart..."

2085
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,520
"...while your stole's yellow."

2086
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:54,480
"Turn your gaze and look at me."

2087
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:56,650
"The color of your lipstick..."

2088
01:50:56,730 --> 01:51:01,440
"...is casting a spell on me,
slowly-slowly."

2089
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:04,850
"Don't mind today, because its Holi."

2090
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:08,400
"Don't mind today, because its Holi."

2091
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:09,400
What happened, boss?

2092
01:51:09,850 --> 01:51:10,810
All okay.

2093
01:51:11,150 --> 01:51:13,940
I feel terrible for brother Kaptan.

2094
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:16,400
Anu should have at
least shown his face once.

2095
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:17,190
This is completely wrong.

2096
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:20,350
I feel brother Kaptan
has been treated unfairly.

2097
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:28,690
I will go talk to him.

2098
01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:29,560
Let me go talk to him.

2099
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:31,100
What are you doing?

2100
01:51:31,270 --> 01:51:32,650
How will we go back?

2101
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:33,690
Stop.

2102
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:35,400
How will we live in this city now?

2103
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:37,600
If I catch that Anu
Sharma in the city again...

2104
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:40,600
...I will kill him.

2105
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:42,560
Keep an eye on his house.

2106
01:51:42,650 --> 01:51:43,270
Yes, boss.

2107
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:47,730
"My t-shirt's purple, sweetheart..."

2108
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:51,100
"...while your stole's yellow."

2109
01:51:51,190 --> 01:51:54,850
"My t-shirt's purple, sweetheart..."

2110
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:56,060
"...while your stole's yellow."

2111
01:51:56,150 --> 01:51:57,560
You saw that idiot's film.

2112
01:51:57,980 --> 01:52:00,350
Of course not.
I was just humming a tune.

2113
01:52:00,650 --> 01:52:02,190
But that song is from his film.

2114
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:04,150
I see... I don't know.

2115
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:06,400
Look at this.

2116
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:09,770
He went to see that boy's
film and also humming his songs.

2117
01:52:11,230 --> 01:52:12,230
I warn you.

2118
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:17,060
If anyone else sees his film,
then I will leave for good.

2119
01:52:17,270 --> 01:52:20,690
- Do I have any respect, or not?
- Of course, you do.

2120
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:24,770
We're in conversation
with Writer/Director...

2121
01:52:24,850 --> 01:52:27,520
...Anirudh Sharma recently
released film Saabit.

2122
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:28,560
Hello, sir.

2123
01:52:28,650 --> 01:52:30,100
This is your first film,

2124
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:32,940
and its also managed to
garner a pretty good response.

2125
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:36,230
I never imagined this, but it is
actually getting a very good response.

2126
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:39,400
Is this film connected
with your personal life?

2127
01:52:39,730 --> 01:52:40,350
I don't know...

2128
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:42,940
But there are some characters
that are connected with my life.

2129
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:43,440
I see...

2130
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:47,350
And I would like to
request those people that...

2131
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:49,270
...this is their film,
and they should go watch it.

2132
01:52:49,350 --> 01:52:50,400
hey...hey...hey...

2133
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:51,900
Guru!

2134
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:53,980
Guru!

2135
01:52:55,980 --> 01:52:58,900
Have you lost your mind?

2136
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:03,940
The TVs smashed to pieces.

2137
01:53:04,690 --> 01:53:05,730
Don't try to be over smart.

2138
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:08,020
I am doing what I am doing.
Why do you have an objection?

2139
01:53:08,270 --> 01:53:09,060
What?

2140
01:53:09,150 --> 01:53:11,060
That bloody...

2141
01:53:12,150 --> 01:53:14,060
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

2142
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:16,060
Can you come to Kanpur?

2143
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:18,190
Kanpur.

2144
01:53:18,270 --> 01:53:19,980
For a prayer service.

2145
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:23,400
Actually, Janardhan used
to come down from Allahabad...

2146
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:25,520
...but, these days he's unable to.

2147
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:27,190
So, can you come down?

2148
01:53:27,770 --> 01:53:29,900
I'll send advance as well.

2149
01:53:30,350 --> 01:53:31,350
Of course.

2150
01:53:37,940 --> 01:53:39,400
If anyone calls on this number...

2151
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,850
...can you talk to
him in a female voice.

2152
01:53:43,150 --> 01:53:44,600
Female voice?

2153
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:46,480
Of course.

2154
01:53:48,690 --> 01:53:51,100
This is your aunt speaking.

2155
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:52,350
Okay.

2156
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:55,690
But Maithili,
I don't want any trouble.

2157
01:53:55,770 --> 01:53:56,850
Just take care.

2158
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:59,150
If I stay out of the
house for more than an hour...

2159
01:53:59,230 --> 01:54:01,440
...then everyone starts calling me up.

2160
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:04,980
I just want to see the film, uncle.

2161
01:54:06,150 --> 01:54:08,650
Okay. Okay.

2162
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:12,730
You hardly have any clients.

2163
01:54:13,350 --> 01:54:15,150
So how did you get a client in Kanpur?

2164
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:16,650
Someone must have recommended my name.

2165
01:54:17,190 --> 01:54:18,480
They also sent advance 2500 rupees.

2166
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:21,190
I am only asking because
you've beaten more people up

2167
01:54:21,270 --> 01:54:22,810
than you've done any good to them.

2168
01:54:23,350 --> 01:54:25,650
I hope you don't have
any enemies in Kanpur.

2169
01:54:25,730 --> 01:54:28,020
Even if I do, I will take care of him.

2170
01:54:29,190 --> 01:54:30,900
I am going completely prepared.

2171
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:35,020
Listen...

2172
01:54:36,190 --> 01:54:37,270
Listen...

2173
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:42,020
Will you bring a
bag for me from Kanpur?

2174
01:54:42,770 --> 01:54:44,690
I've heard they are pretty good.

2175
01:54:55,270 --> 01:54:57,310
- Did you lock the door, dear?
- Yes.

2176
01:55:33,230 --> 01:55:35,270
- Milan Talkies.
- No.

2177
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:05,810
Excuse me.

2178
01:56:55,270 --> 01:56:56,690
Who are you, dear?
Why are you crying?

2179
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:00,770
Maithili, it's you?

2180
01:57:03,310 --> 01:57:04,230
What happened?

2181
01:57:04,850 --> 01:57:06,810
Brother Usman, I want to see the film.

2182
01:57:07,310 --> 01:57:08,400
But I arrived too late.

2183
01:57:08,650 --> 01:57:10,020
What are you wearing?

2184
01:57:11,770 --> 01:57:13,480
I snuck out of the home.

2185
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:17,100
Just show me the film.

2186
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:20,440
I would,
but it's almost halfway through.

2187
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:23,980
No, I want to see the full movie.

2188
01:57:25,690 --> 01:57:28,440
I can't come again, brother Usman.

2189
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:34,730
The show's over.

2190
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:38,060
Let's start your personal show.

2191
01:57:41,230 --> 01:57:42,100
Come on.

2192
01:57:46,310 --> 01:57:47,480
Sit wherever you like.

2193
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
"Whether we live in
palaces or on the streets."

2194
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:34,900
"Or under heavy guard."

2195
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:38,900
"But no one can ever separate us."

2196
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:42,000
"Not in Church,
not even in the temple."

2197
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:45,000
"Not even on the
threshold of any mosque."

2198
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:48,130
"I saw God only in your face."

2199
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:54,940
"Our love story is still incomplete..."

2200
01:58:54,970 --> 01:58:58,800
"...then so be it."

2201
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:05,000
"I shall not love anyone else
other than you..."

2202
01:59:05,730 --> 01:59:08,060
"...I made this pact with myself."

2203
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:13,400
"...I made this pact with myself."

2204
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:19,770
- "I saw God only in your face."
- What happened?

2205
01:59:19,850 --> 01:59:20,900
Did you like it?

2206
01:59:25,850 --> 01:59:27,520
'But make films only for me.'

2207
01:59:29,270 --> 01:59:32,850
'Whether anyone likes it or not.
but I should like it.'

2208
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:34,150
'You will.'

2209
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:37,980
'If you do that...you'll
always be my hero.'

2210
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:42,400
Was it good?

2211
01:59:43,190 --> 01:59:44,020
Yes.

2212
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:47,230
Go on, then.
Even I'll lock up the place and leave.

2213
01:59:47,310 --> 01:59:48,350
You're here.

2214
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:50,350
- Hello brother Usman.
- Hello. Hello.

2215
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:52,190
I know its too late
and I am troubling you.

2216
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:54,190
But I didn't want her
to go alone at this hour.

2217
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:55,900
- It's okay. I'll take her home.
- Will you?

2218
01:59:56,190 --> 01:59:56,900
Hi, Maithili.

2219
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:00,520
Brother Usman, I cannot go home.

2220
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:03,150
Why?

2221
02:00:04,730 --> 02:00:05,900
Anu is coming.

2222
02:00:06,850 --> 02:00:07,600
After two days.

2223
02:00:07,690 --> 02:00:08,520
In Milan Talkies.

2224
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:10,400
For me.

2225
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:12,310
But I just spoke with him yesterday.

2226
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:14,810
He was asking whether
Maithili saw the film or not.

2227
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:16,850
Because he wanted me to see his film.

2228
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:19,940
But the film's over now, so go home.

2229
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:22,230
Brother Usmaan,
we couldn't meet or talk

2230
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:24,060
before he left, but...

2231
02:00:25,850 --> 02:00:28,520
Remember that guy says in the film...

2232
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:30,310
"I will come back for you."

2233
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:32,690
I will come back to you
when I become successful.

2234
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:35,850
On the same day that was the most
beautiful day of your life.

2235
02:00:36,190 --> 02:00:37,100
9th July.

2236
02:00:37,310 --> 02:00:38,230
9th July.

2237
02:00:39,650 --> 02:00:42,560
Don't you remember?
You guys spread that rumor...

2238
02:00:42,650 --> 02:00:43,940
Oh yes, that Lord
Shankar is drinking milk.

2239
02:00:44,020 --> 02:00:44,900
Yes...

2240
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:47,900
That day we got a little extra time.

2241
02:00:48,770 --> 02:00:49,350
Go home.

2242
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:51,400
Please, brother Usman.

2243
02:00:51,690 --> 02:00:53,480
"Wait for me on 9th July."

2244
02:00:54,190 --> 02:00:56,730
"Same place where we always met."

2245
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:00,350
This might be just
a film for the world...

2246
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:02,600
...but for me,
this is a message, brother Usman.

2247
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:06,190
Anu will definitely come.

2248
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:07,270
Today is 7th July.

2249
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:09,600
Two days later,
on 9th July, he will come for me.

2250
02:01:09,690 --> 02:01:10,690
He will...

2251
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:12,440
Look dear.

2252
02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:16,100
If I go home now and get caught...

2253
02:01:17,190 --> 02:01:18,150
...then I will never
be able to come back again.

2254
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:20,060
You're putting me
in a predicament, child.

2255
02:01:20,150 --> 02:01:20,690
- No, no, no.
- Wait a second.

2256
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:24,900
Maithili, if you believe he's coming,
then let's talk to him.

2257
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:26,690
But you can go home till then.

2258
02:01:26,770 --> 02:01:28,020
Just a second, brother Usman.

2259
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:33,400
Hello, Anu.

2260
02:01:35,230 --> 02:01:39,230
This is his friend Mayank
Goel speaking from Allahabad.

2261
02:01:39,310 --> 02:01:40,520
Please tell him its very urgent.

2262
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:41,650
Let her talk.

2263
02:01:43,850 --> 02:01:44,600
Talk to him.

2264
02:01:44,980 --> 02:01:45,520
What?

2265
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:50,730
He is busy.

2266
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:54,650
I mean he's giving
narration to some big star.

2267
02:01:58,520 --> 02:01:59,480
Salman Khan?

2268
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:01,650
Child.

2269
02:02:02,650 --> 02:02:04,520
- I won't go home.
- This is a cinema hall.

2270
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:05,850
Go home.

2271
02:02:06,810 --> 02:02:08,520
I won't go.
I will stay right here.

2272
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:10,980
She is so stubborn.
Won't go home.

2273
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:12,410
And what did he say?

2274
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:13,370
He must have said something.

2275
02:02:13,450 --> 02:02:15,330
As I said, sir.
I couldn't talk to him.

2276
02:02:15,660 --> 02:02:17,750
Someone else answered the
phone and said... sir is busy,

2277
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:19,290
he's narrating a film to Salman Khan.

2278
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:19,950
What?

2279
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:21,080
Yes.

2280
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:24,040
- Salman is on?
- Salman is on, uncle.

2281
02:02:24,330 --> 02:02:26,040
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2282
02:02:26,330 --> 02:02:28,870
He's Salman Khan.
He's not easily available.

2283
02:02:28,950 --> 02:02:30,660
Our daughter is missing.

2284
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:32,250
And we doubt it's your son's doing.

2285
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:34,160
- Only doubt.
- And he's talking about Salman Khan.

2286
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:35,330
Only doubt.

2287
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:36,200
Wait a minute.

2288
02:02:36,410 --> 02:02:37,620
Why do you doubt our son?

2289
02:02:37,830 --> 02:02:40,000
- Look, sister...
- He's in Mumbai.

2290
02:02:40,330 --> 02:02:40,950
- Sobha.
- Listen...

2291
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,790
- Look here, I don't talk to women.
- I get it.

2292
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:45,040
- Sobha.
- This is a Police Station.

2293
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:47,200
- Sobha, this doesn't suit you.
- Sobha.

2294
02:02:47,290 --> 02:02:48,160
That's her name.

2295
02:02:48,290 --> 02:02:49,080
Sobha.

2296
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,080
It's a small-town mentality.

2297
02:02:51,330 --> 02:02:52,160
What small-town mentality.

2298
02:02:52,250 --> 02:02:54,580
We live in a small town,
so we have a small town mentality.

2299
02:02:54,660 --> 02:02:57,290
His career is at the peak, but these
guys are trying to drag him down here.

2300
02:02:57,370 --> 02:02:58,330
Don't be such a wise-guy.

2301
02:02:58,410 --> 02:03:00,000
Calm down.

2302
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:02,500
I know what feats your
son accomplished in the city.

2303
02:03:02,580 --> 02:03:04,000
This is a Police Station,
not your home.

2304
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:06,290
And let me tell you one thing clearly...

2305
02:03:06,540 --> 02:03:09,830
If I find out that one
of you is involved in this...

2306
02:03:09,910 --> 02:03:10,580
Then?

2307
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:13,250
- Even the Police cannot save you.
- Hey, ...what nonsense.

2308
02:03:13,330 --> 02:03:14,250
Look at him.

2309
02:03:14,330 --> 02:03:16,500
- Calm down.
- I'll teach you a lesson you will never forget.

2310
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:41,620
What do you think you're doing?

2311
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:43,330
Stop cleaning up the place.

2312
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:45,870
Who asked you to do any of this?
People will get suspicious.

2313
02:03:46,700 --> 02:03:47,250
Sorry.

2314
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:50,500
The Police have arrested Kurban,
Phattu, and Mayank.

2315
02:03:51,120 --> 02:03:53,040
And also taping Anu's phone.

2316
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:56,330
There is no way to communicate
with him. And keep the windows closed.

2317
02:04:00,910 --> 02:04:02,700
People are always keeping an eye out.

2318
02:04:06,620 --> 02:04:08,250
I brought some food and clothes.

2319
02:04:12,700 --> 02:04:14,410
I am making things
difficult for you, right?

2320
02:04:14,950 --> 02:04:17,200
Frankly speaking yes, you are trouble.

2321
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:23,580
But after watching so many films,
I've become so melodramatic myself...

2322
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,700
...that Usman won't betray you.

2323
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:32,330
- Will you eat my cooking?
- Yes, I will.

2324
02:04:33,620 --> 02:04:36,790
I've got gourd and lentil.
As well as bread.

2325
02:04:37,410 --> 02:04:38,750
Eat properly.

2326
02:04:46,750 --> 02:04:49,540
- Well, I am leaving.
- Okay.

2327
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,290
Take care.

2328
02:04:55,370 --> 02:04:56,580
Brother Usman.

2329
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,910
Can you get some things for me?

2330
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:02,500
What kind of things?

2331
02:05:02,870 --> 02:05:04,410
Mascara, a pencil, and a bindi.

2332
02:05:10,950 --> 02:05:11,700
Okay.

2333
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:50,200
listen.

2334
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:53,540
Banwari. Hariya.

2335
02:05:54,750 --> 02:05:55,580
Banteshwar.

2336
02:05:55,660 --> 02:05:57,160
Maithali's phone rang.

2337
02:05:57,580 --> 02:05:58,830
Her phone rang four times.

2338
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:01,290
Maithali's phone rang four times.

2339
02:06:01,370 --> 02:06:02,910
Call the Police.

2340
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,040
It doesn't have to be Maithili.

2341
02:06:05,580 --> 02:06:06,790
Could be someone else?

2342
02:06:06,870 --> 02:06:08,870
I suggest that we check
the local hospitals.

2343
02:06:08,950 --> 02:06:11,080
Why do you always talk so negative?

2344
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:14,790
It would've never come to this
if you thought positively.

2345
02:06:15,910 --> 02:06:19,620
Maithili left because
she wasn't happy with you.

2346
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:21,620
You couldn't give her any happiness.

2347
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:27,500
I cursed myself a dozen times
for letting her marry you.

2348
02:06:28,250 --> 02:06:32,830
I often wanted to
drown you in the river.

2349
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:38,250
If anything happens to Maithili, Guru.

2350
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:45,450
Then I swear,
this time I will fulfill my desire.

2351
02:06:55,660 --> 02:06:56,700
What do you think?

2352
02:06:57,330 --> 02:06:58,540
What time will he come?

2353
02:07:01,370 --> 02:07:03,160
I came to see him at 12.

2354
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:15,790
"I know it's not
easy for you to come..."

2355
02:07:16,620 --> 02:07:21,160
"...I admit I have doubts too."

2356
02:07:21,790 --> 02:07:26,500
"And yet I eagerly await you..."

2357
02:07:26,790 --> 02:07:30,950
"...because that's the least I can do."

2358
02:07:36,750 --> 02:07:41,330
"I know it's not
easy for you to come..."

2359
02:07:41,870 --> 02:07:46,040
"...I admit I have doubts too."

2360
02:07:46,950 --> 02:07:51,540
"And yet I eagerly await you..."

2361
02:07:51,950 --> 02:07:56,200
"...because that's the least I can do."

2362
02:07:57,040 --> 02:08:01,870
- "I will fight even against fate..."
- He'll arrive until the next show.

2363
02:08:01,950 --> 02:08:06,450
"...your lover's determined."

2364
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:11,540
"I shall love no one
else other than you..."

2365
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:16,120
"...I've made that pact with myself."

2366
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:19,790
Milan Talkies. And make it quick.

2367
02:08:22,580 --> 02:08:24,120
- So Anu.
- What is this?

2368
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:25,120
Let's go.

2369
02:08:25,330 --> 02:08:27,040
- Where?
- Brother Kaptan wants to meet you.

2370
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:29,120
You work for Kaptan, do you?
We'll meet later.

2371
02:08:30,290 --> 02:08:32,040
Let go. Let go.

2372
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:36,410
I said let go.
I am not hitting you.

2373
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:40,040
How dare you mock brother Kaptan?

2374
02:08:50,370 --> 02:08:54,080
I quit my profession and started this
travel business because of you.

2375
02:08:55,790 --> 02:08:59,750
I thought I will do business
and acting together.

2376
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,830
But business is all time low...

2377
02:09:02,660 --> 02:09:04,950
...plus you humiliated
me in your film too.

2378
02:09:05,620 --> 02:09:06,870
Who is responsible for this?

2379
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:10,080
I can only apologize now.

2380
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:14,830
I was embarrassed, and publicly too.

2381
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:18,120
I will clobber you
with my shoe 50 times

2382
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:19,540
in the middle of the city...

2383
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:21,200
...and only then will I forgive you.

2384
02:09:21,410 --> 02:09:22,040
Come on.

2385
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:25,950
What if I launch you?

2386
02:09:26,700 --> 02:09:28,290
Introducing Kaptan Singh.

2387
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:29,830
- He's lying again.
- Shut up.

2388
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:32,910
Do you know when you see your
name on the screen in big letters...

2389
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,830
...Introducing Kaptan Singh.

2390
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,370
Now I am going to
clobber you 100 times.

2391
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:40,700
Bring him.

2392
02:09:42,410 --> 02:09:44,450
My next film is with Salman Khan.

2393
02:09:45,120 --> 02:09:46,250
And there's a role of his friend.

2394
02:09:46,660 --> 02:09:47,580
And it's just amazing.

2395
02:09:55,580 --> 02:09:57,120
Are you planning on
staying for a few days, Anu?

2396
02:09:57,450 --> 02:09:59,910
Start building up your body,
brother Kaptan.

2397
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:02,790
Don't worry,
I am joining the gym tomorrow.

2398
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:05,790
And keep sending me
your pictures on WhatsApp.

2399
02:10:08,370 --> 02:10:08,950
Okay.

2400
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:10,000
Bye.

2401
02:10:13,660 --> 02:10:16,500
Why would he remember us now?

2402
02:10:16,700 --> 02:10:19,000
He's making his next
film with Salman Khan.

2403
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:20,040
Our local lad.

2404
02:10:20,540 --> 02:10:24,660
With the best heroines at disposal,
why would he come here for Maithili?

2405
02:10:24,950 --> 02:10:26,450
I am speaking out of
40 years of experience.

2406
02:10:26,700 --> 02:10:27,500
He won't come.

2407
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:28,750
I have a lot of experience
in the film industry.

2408
02:10:28,910 --> 02:10:32,200
But you just play the film on
the projector, but its made in Mumbai.

2409
02:10:32,950 --> 02:10:36,200
You mean to say that until you're
not posted in the Police Headquarters...

2410
02:10:36,290 --> 02:10:38,500
...i should not regard
you like the Police?

2411
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:40,910
"I will come back for you..."

2412
02:10:41,660 --> 02:10:44,120
"...On the most beautiful day of your life."

2413
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:55,500
You're leaving without
giving an answer.

2414
02:11:04,830 --> 02:11:06,700
I was returning home, you know.

2415
02:11:10,750 --> 02:11:15,040
We met on this day at 12,
so I thought...

2416
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:16,620
...maybe...

2417
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:28,330
We're meeting after 3-long-years.

2418
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:36,500
- I never thought that you...
- What?

2419
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:40,080
Whether I will understand
your message or not?

2420
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,290
That's how I am.

2421
02:11:45,790 --> 02:11:46,910
Failure.

2422
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:50,910
Maithili.

2423
02:11:54,830 --> 02:11:57,040
Life won't be easy at first, Maithili.

2424
02:12:00,700 --> 02:12:03,450
But you see,
we'll pass this life exam with merit.

2425
02:12:06,790 --> 02:12:08,120
Without cheating.

2426
02:12:11,790 --> 02:12:13,080
Where will you take me?

2427
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:21,330
It can fall any day, but
this will be my final resting place.

2428
02:12:21,410 --> 02:12:24,370
- Don't talk rubbish.
- This place is so peaceful.

2429
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:26,750
- Let's go.
- Come here. Come here.

2430
02:12:26,830 --> 02:12:29,040
- Brother Usman...
- Let's go get some fritters.

2431
02:12:30,830 --> 02:12:32,330
This is the time to get fritters.

2432
02:12:32,790 --> 02:12:35,410
Mister, let's go. Hurry up.

2433
02:12:37,370 --> 02:12:39,620
- Malvia Nagar.
- Why Malvia Nagar?

2434
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:41,750
I came back for you.

2435
02:12:42,450 --> 02:12:44,750
And I won't leave without
taking your family's approval.

2436
02:12:45,330 --> 02:12:47,370
- I mean it.
- You're making a big mistake.

2437
02:12:47,830 --> 02:12:50,000
Now that I've developed some courage,
let's make this mistake.

2438
02:12:50,950 --> 02:12:51,950
It is what it is.

2439
02:13:06,330 --> 02:13:08,830
Go on. I am right here.

2440
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:38,660
Father.

2441
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:51,200
He's outside.

2442
02:13:52,410 --> 02:13:53,330
Who?

2443
02:13:54,410 --> 02:13:55,200
Anu.

2444
02:14:13,290 --> 02:14:14,910
I guess he ran away again.

2445
02:14:16,040 --> 02:14:18,200
Guru Panda was dragging some guy.

2446
02:14:18,290 --> 02:14:19,790
And he looked furious.

2447
02:14:28,830 --> 02:14:29,410
Anu.

2448
02:14:30,580 --> 02:14:32,120
Guru! Guru!

2449
02:14:41,790 --> 02:14:42,910
Let him go!

2450
02:14:43,700 --> 02:14:44,660
Hurry up.

2451
02:14:45,580 --> 02:14:46,330
Come on.

2452
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:49,120
Anu.

2453
02:15:03,080 --> 02:15:05,120
Guru, don't hit him.

2454
02:15:18,370 --> 02:15:19,910
- Hey...
- Guru!

2455
02:15:20,750 --> 02:15:21,750
Anu!

2456
02:15:21,950 --> 02:15:23,500
Hey...

2457
02:15:25,580 --> 02:15:27,910
Shoot. Shoot me.

2458
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:30,750
Don't get too excited, father-in-law.

2459
02:15:30,950 --> 02:15:32,540
Or I will actually shoot.

2460
02:15:36,450 --> 02:15:38,000
Save yourselves today.

2461
02:15:38,870 --> 02:15:40,540
I will deal with him tomorrow.

2462
02:15:40,700 --> 02:15:42,790
What are you doing?
I am your son-in-law.

2463
02:15:45,290 --> 02:15:46,410
Catch them.

2464
02:16:16,290 --> 02:16:17,660
Who pulled the chain?

2465
02:16:29,950 --> 02:16:33,250
Nothing stays constant,
whether its fate,

2466
02:16:33,700 --> 02:16:36,540
time, kingdoms, or Emperor.

2467
02:16:37,370 --> 02:16:45,200
But a person blessed by love is the only one
that stays constant in this ever-changing world.

2468
