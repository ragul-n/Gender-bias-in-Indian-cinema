1
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:54,955
Anna, what is this?

2
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,256
It's the company's ID tag.

3
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,526
Heard you have some
big shot job in Hyderabad.

4
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,093
Yeah.

5
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:00,994
You are great, Anna

6
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,129
Hey, watch it man.
-Hey!

7
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:03,564
Add two sodas to my tab.

8
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,832
You need to pay me 10 sodas
to take a look at your tab.

9
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:07,568
Oh man,

10
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:08,435
What an idiot.

11
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,971
Nobody does anything
but talks big in Jogipet.

12
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,806
They're the first to talk nonsense.

13
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,241
So what's been happening at Jogipet.

14
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,309
What can I say?

15
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,410
Everything's the same.

16
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,213
Every morning that Karim still
wakes us up with those awful songs.

17
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:21,048
And there's that Mallesh right?
-yeah, yeah

18
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,983
He applied for a KFC license.

19
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:23,450
Huh...

20
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,651
And because that didn't work out,

21
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,153
he put up a MFC.

22
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,454
And do you know what it stands for?

23
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,056
Mallesh Fried Chicken.

24
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,657
Disgusting,

25
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,059
Not a single piece is edible,

26
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,293
More bone and no flesh.

27
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,095
Nothing changes at Jogipet.

28
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,129
Praveen...

29
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:36,630
Yeah?

30
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,398
Heard you've bagged
a good job in Hyderabad?

31
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,466
Something like that...

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,335
My daughter also stays in Hyderabad.

33
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:41,969
-Oh

34
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,637
We're thinking of getting her married this year.

35
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,238
-okay

36
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,906
Here, look at her photo.

37
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:46,573
Let me see...

38
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,177
Having a good job is not enough,

39
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,646
Also watch out for who your friends are.

40
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,847
For the girl's hand in marriage,

41
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:54,615
all of this comes into consideration.

42
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:55,616
Yes, right!

43
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,885
And your daughter is
some fine looking actress right?

44
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:58,685
Hey, let her be.

45
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,153
Jogipet is full of these idiots.

46
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,055
Intelligent people like us
don't belong here.

47
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,023
Hey Praveen....

48
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:03,757
Yes uncle,

49
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,060
Heard you've bagged some big job,

50
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,763
One selfie, please
-Yeah sure uncle.

51
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:10,297
Come here,

52
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,400
Ew, get out.

53
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:14,968
Why are you overreacting?

54
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,537
There are too many jobless
people in Jogipet now.

55
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:17,104
-oh

56
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,239
At least you keep up the town's reputation.

57
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,007
Okay uncle.

58
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,375
There is no respect here.

59
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,943
I'm not being respected.

60
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:24,178
Hmm

61
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,748
If I come to the city with you,

62
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:28,916
Can you please find me a job there?

63
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,251
Will your father agree if you come to city?

64
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,154
Why don't you just here,
happily looking after the ladies' emporium.

65
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,889
SRIKANTH LADIES EMPORIUM

66
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,492
Yeah

67
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,660
Ladies?

68
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,095
Sir...

69
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,399
We're short on female character
for our play 'Sati Ansuya'

70
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,601
Ah,

71
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,136
Ladies Emporium Srikanth is there no?

72
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,204
Put him in the play.

73
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,182
Srikanth

74
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:08,615
Hmm.

75
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:09,850
I need to tell you something.

76
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,617
Me too.

77
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:12,886
I actually...
-Me too...

78
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,054
-Me too..

79
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,357
My fiancÃ© is coming to see me.

80
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,393
He should fall flat, once he sees me.

81
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,428
Could you please select a
matching petticoat and fall for this saree?

82
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:21,828
Me?

83
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,264
It is in your hands...
-I wonâ€™t, please.

84
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,666
But you have to take a look Srikanth
-Why?

85
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:26,967
Because...

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,403
Whenever any girl sees you in Jogipet,

87
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,605
They're only reminded of
Ladies Emporium Matching.

88
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:36,443
Vanajakshi...

89
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:38,612
Vanajakshi...

90
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,416
Are the bangles not matching?

91
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,519
You know everything.

92
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,157
Vanajakshi...

93
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,362
Praveen Anna,

94
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,631
Take a look at this certificates once.

95
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,300
They are teasing me by calling me
ladies emporium Srikanth.

96
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,536
If you set up a job for me in Hyderabad,

97
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,004
Cybera...

98
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,806
Cyberabad Srikanth has a nice ring to it.

99
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,241
10th standard, 60%

100
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,909
intermediate, 50%

101
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,411
and in B.Tech ,40%

102
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,147
What is this?

103
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,716
Thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t do M.Tech, Anna

104
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:17,451
Him,

105
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,653
And a job in Hyderabad?

106
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:24,925
If anyone in the whole of Jogipet
and Sanga Reddy offers him a job,

107
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,226
Then that person is more
useless than this one.

108
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,195
Daddy, when I sit at the
ladies emporium all day

109
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,830
All my friends are teasing me by calling me
'Ladies Srikanth'

110
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,365
Friends? Who are these friends?

111
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:32,566
I don't understand...

112
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,934
Why are there no contractions?

113
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,373
Yeah, yeah, the contractions have begun.

114
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,545
What is this?

115
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:45,779
Scores.

116
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,347
When you were born to the sound
of the pressure cooker only,

117
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,815
I understood that
you were useless

118
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,616
Shekar babu,

119
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,786
It's only because of your kindness,
my daughterâ€™s marriage survived

120
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,489
She learned how much rice
to put in a rice cooker,

121
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,723
The amount of water...

122
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,059
And how to cook the rice.

123
00:05:59,092 --> 00:05:59,893
Thank you, babu.

124
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,700
Shouldn't there be another friend, Uncle?

125
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,035
Skinny and bearded.

126
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,536
Yeah of course he's there.

127
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,405
You've passed out drunk again?

128
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:12,406
As if you're a 'love failure'

129
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:13,373
Let's go.
-Ah!

130
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,509
Buttermilk? Let him drink sister,
let him drink.

131
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,678
If he was that drunk
it must have been love failure.

132
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:21,682
What do you mean?

133
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,851
Should only love failures
get drunk and pass out?

134
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,553
Wait right there.

135
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:27,454
Hello

136
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:28,522
Hello Miss

137
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,691
I am 'loving' you.

138
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:31,959
Ravi?

139
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:32,826
Yeah, Speak out!

140
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,128
Pour out all the hatred you have for me.

141
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,296
It's not like that Ravi.

142
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:36,997
Okay,

143
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,966
I get it, I'm a love failure.

144
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,734
My heart is shattered.

145
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,337
If anybody calls for me,

146
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,538
Tell them that I'm at Ganesh wines.

147
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,106
My love is gone
-I was going to tell you...

148
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,140
Ravi!

149
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,343
What perfect
companions he found,

150
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,978
one â€œchote Miaâ€

151
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:52,746
Hey!

152
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,313
Wait.

153
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,681
It's your gift go.
-Yeah, I'm going.

154
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:00,287
Uncle, come this side.

155
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,356
Go there, stand next to them.

156
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,425
Itâ€™s our gift, Chintu.

157
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,967
Look, Look at our heroes!
Well rounded zeroes!

158
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,170
Hello Uncle, we've saved
another colour for you.

159
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,104
Come, sit.

160
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:18,572
Let's all four of us play.

161
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,908
Anywhere in surrounding towns

162
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,109
You cannot find the better clowns

163
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,110
Gift?

164
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,212
To find their worthy peers

165
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:26,647
You need to wait hundred years

166
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:28,882
Iâ€™ll get my purse, one minute.

167
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,551
Satellites cannot place
These street rockets

168
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,486
Namaste Amma.
-Namaste Sir

169
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,321
With holes in their pockets

170
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,223
Trash talking Innocents

171
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,058
Worthless than fifty cents

172
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,159
Sleep like there's no tomorrow

173
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,093
Wake like there's no sorrow

174
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,562
Work like a dead sparrow

175
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,597
Look, Look at our heroes!

176
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,365
Well rounded zeroes!

177
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,834
Valueless diamonds

178
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,569
Our precious gems!

179
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,571
Namaste Amma.
-Namaste Sir

180
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:51,305
-Are you well?
-Yes,

181
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,372
It's been so long since I've seen you around.

182
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,175
Eee! Loverboy,
carry on with your lover!

183
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,710
Okay amma, I'm leaving.

184
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,811
Stay safe.

185
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,714
Loverboy!

186
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:02,783
Mama,

187
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,753
Who was the first person to
wear jeans pants in Jogipet?

188
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:07,788
Morning Prayers

189
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,356
Jeans?

190
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,325
Pratap Reddy wore it, dude.

191
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,392
No dude, it was Aziz.

192
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,862
He saw the movie â€œTere Naamâ€

193
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,063
Also, his hair used to be this long.

194
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,898
Hey, that Aziz used to roam
in shorts in front of me.

195
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,466
-That guy and pants?

196
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,134
Santosh Anna wore it first.

197
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,035
Shut up dude.

198
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,470
It was Pratapâ€™s father who
brought jeans from Muscat

199
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,838
for the first time

200
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,274
Santosh brother wore 2 jeans, bro,
after watching â€œGudumba Shankarâ€

201
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,742
How can anyone wear 2 jeans, idiot?

202
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,644
it was Santosh Anna, who introduced
the jeans fashion in Jogipet.

203
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,079
Aziz wore Jeans first in Jogipet.

204
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,146
Evening prayers

205
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:40,053
Hey, These Aziz and Pratap used to
wear lungis and roam before Santosh Anna.

206
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:46,226
You know who introduced torn jeans,
Santosh popularized torn jeans.

207
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,394
Sweetheart!

208
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,829
Don't compare them with monkeys

209
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,764
The monkeys will start a strike

210
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,399
If they meditate

211
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,168
The cranes will jump to their fate.

212
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,036
Don't let them run around the town

213
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,071
The clocks will hang themselves

214
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,073
If you are in their sight

215
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,142
You'll be left in your underwear

216
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,111
Anyways, are you offering drink or not
You tell me that first.

217
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:04,811
Hey, let that be.

218
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,446
The girl, is set.

219
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,980
Is it?

220
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,517
I am thinking of
preparing for IAS seriously.

221
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,619
I will definitely
pass Group II exams this time, mama

222
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,055
We need to crack them this year-

223
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,024
-Uncle, when did you come?

224
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,526
Hey, does this road
belong to your father, huh?

225
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,061
Dirty cycle, remove

226
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:21,595
Hey remove it.

227
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,629
Hey
-Hey

228
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,265
Hey, remove it.
you

229
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,250
Who will give job to these fellows?

230
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,688
Thatâ€™s why, I am starting a big shop
on his name, 'Srikanth Ladies Emporium'.

231
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,123
I promise I'll kill myself
under a moving lorry.

232
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:50,624
Hey...

233
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:52,125
I will organize your life, my son.

234
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,961
No, I donâ€™t want this kind of life.

235
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,629
I want Praveen anna's life.

236
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,764
I will do a job and wear the
company Id tag too around my neck.

237
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,066
Hey, if you want to wear a tag,

238
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,535
I will get one prepared on
our shopâ€™s name tomorrow.

00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,569
Customer.

00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:03,203
Please come.

241
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:04,605

matching bangles for this saree.

00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,806
Show me your hand once.

243

Did you see akka?

244
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:17,384
Only our Srikanth can set the
matching bangles for saree.

245
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,120
Wasn't the bride beautiful
on Saritha's wedding?

246
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,588
Srikanth only set all the
matching accessories for the saree.

247
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:22,956
Everybody was praising him.

248
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:27,327
Srikanth, You have to match the
bangles for the saree function.

249
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,428
Ok Srikanth.
-Ok.

250
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:32,699
Did you see how famous he is?

251
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,735
All married and unmarried
ladies in and around,

252
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:35,836
Come to our shop only for him,

253
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,372
So talent and still
you want to go elsewhere?

254
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,439
Hey Srikanth,

255
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,808
I am writing all the
properties to your name right?

256
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,277
OK. Write all the properties to my name.

257
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:45,479
but don't write
my name on all the properties.

258
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,281
Even if there is a new scheme in India,

259
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,683
offering a job to one person from each family,
he still won't get a job.

260
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:50,918
Don't you know about him?

261
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,486
That's why,
I will set your life right.

262
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,922
It's okay, I'll set my own life right.
It is my nature.

263
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,657
Look, give me 2 months' time,

264
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,058
Iâ€™ll go to Hyderabad
and get a job.

265
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,326
If I donâ€™t get a job,

266
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,427
I myself will come
and sit in the shop

267
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:01,762
keep my mouth shut. Okay?

268
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:02,429
Okay

269
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,864
You have two months' time.

270
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,566
If you get job, cool.

271
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,400
Or else,

272
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,269
Srikanth Ladies Emporium. huh?

273
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,970
Okay.

274
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,406
Watch what I become in two months.

275
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,029
Mama, you are going to Hyderabad?
You're great.

276
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,698
Hey, thanks dude.

277
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:39,900
Mama

278
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:44,605
Tomorrow let's go hunting
to kill deer and wild boar.

279
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,074
I will bring my father's pistol.
-Hey shut your mouth.

280
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,410
We are talking about
environmental protection, uncle.

281
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,613
Hey, let's hunt exotic animals
-Hey stop it.

282
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:53,814
Salman Khan himself is
still stuck in the case.

283
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,282
If anyone hears us,
they will throw us the a Jail

284
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,884
Are you afraid of partying?

285
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,453
Who's afraid dude, let's go.

286
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,521
Who will touch me?

287
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,423
Who can touch me in this Jogipet?

288
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,859
Deer, camel anything you like for the party.

289
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:07,261
I will show you.

290
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,062
I will empty the
whole jungle for you.

291
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,832
Deer, camel.
etc., letâ€™s go mama...

292
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,036
Walk fast, don't shake it hard.

293
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:46,767
Your khaki uniform and bullets
wonâ€™t silence our mouths, Inspector.

294
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,803
If you think you can hold
the whole sun in your palms,

295
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,605
you're ignorant inspector.

296
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,073
Your ignorance!

297
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:57,945
In the heart of the patriot,
there are Tamanna, Samantha, and...

298
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:58,745
Rashmika...

299
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,949
all the 3 together are there.

300
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,654
Oh Sir, rice didnâ€™t boil properly.

301
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:14,595
Mama,

302
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:18,932
throw that plate here,
see, it should come crawling here.

303
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,368
Throw it.

304
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:27,307
My hunger strike for Jogipet youth.

305
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:28,976
Dal is good.

306
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,178
Will go on,

307
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,814
And on.

308
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,886
What a feeling mama?

309
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:43,156
Hello!

310
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,491
I got a missed call from this number.
Who is it?

311
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:45,893
Is Ramya there, sir?

312
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,362
Ramya? I donâ€™t know any Ramya.

313
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,998
Oh! sorry sir, wrong number!

314
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,700
You people have a habit of doing
whatever you like and then apologise.

315
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,502
Arre, what is this sir?

316
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:56,870
Is this how you talk to girls?

317
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,404
Hello!

318
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,806
Donâ€™t teach me how to talk to girls.

319
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,776
Love failure, here.
Do you know how much I drink?

320
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,912
Oh! do you drink daily?

321
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,180
Why, sir?

322
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:10,217
To heal the broken heart,

323
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,186
I am sacrificing my liver.

324
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,454
Okay, drink if you want,

325
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,956
but donâ€™t drink it raw, please.

326
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,724
Add a little soda and drink.

327
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,095
Anyways, did you eat something or not?

328
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,969
Hey, why are coughing?

329
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,137
I got a cough.

330
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:30,771
Psst....Psst...

331
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:31,939
What is that? Snake?

332
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,373
It is not snake, it is me.

333
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,475
I thought it is a snake really, you know.

334
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,544
Oh my! How nice!
-Who? Me?

335
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,079
Hey not you, bald head.

336
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,380
Ok. will call you again.

337
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:41,415
What sir, why did you shave your head?

338
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:43,016
My grandmother passed away

339
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,184
Why? Because you shaved?

340
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,693
Jail is very awesome sir.

341
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,062
It is great that Sangareddy
has such a jail.

342
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:55,429
Wow!

343
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,632
Okay, there are small problems
but for 500 rupees.

344
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,367
Hello. Send those photos to my house.

345
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,236
My parents haven't taken a single
photo of me since I was a kid.

346
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,770
That is my only memory.
Do you understand?

347
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,372
Right sir,
I am going to Hyderabad.

348
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,575
I will keep our Jogipet
name flying high.

349
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,646
Hey Srikanth you're going to the city?

350
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:13,080
Yes!

351
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:14,515
Then what about these people?

352
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:16,183
are these people destined
to be frogs in the well.

353
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,851
They're getting
worse day by day.

354
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:18,886
Why don't you talk to them?

355
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,020
What can I tell them uncle?

356
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,123
Us matured people, what a job means,

357
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,625
What life is,

358
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,193
What respect means,

359
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:27,761
These people, really.

360
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:29,930
Damn!

361
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,498
Hopefulness people.

362
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:34,001
His father is looking for
wedding matches for him.

363
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,304
That girlâ€™s life-
-Destroyed! Over!

364
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:38,405
I will give it in writing.

365
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,140
I am afraid of getting married

366
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,575
because of the fear of
having children like these.

367
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:42,809
Our fate, what can we do?

368
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,045
I will go to Hyderabad now.

369
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,613
I hope your blessing
are always with me.

370
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,448
I'll set something for them

371
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:49,616
You donâ€™t worry.

372
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,384
I'll take my leave.

373
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:52,186
Okay

374
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:54,388
Donâ€™t keep calling me,
I am preparing for Civils.

375
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:56,657
Kiss his feet!

376
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:57,491
What Srikanth?

377
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:58,625
I heard you're going to Hyderabad?

378
00:15:58,659 --> 00:15:59,092
-Yes.

379
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,894
A good match for marriage has come for you.

380
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:01,895
They are ready to
give 100 grams of gold

381
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:03,363
and 20 acres of land.

382
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:04,898
Oh, so they won't give the girl?

383
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,800
-Your friends?
- Ew, no.

384
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,536
They asked me for the
address of the liquor shop,

385
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,572
Go straight and take a left.

386
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:12,573
Let us go.

387
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:13,340
-let's go son.

388
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,708
We need to conduct the milk ceremony.

389
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,077
Let's do it Srikanth
-I like doing these things.

390
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:44,638
Blessings.
-Do well son.

391
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:47,541
Why are you peeling that off?

392
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:49,443
Ok I'm leaving.

393
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,144
You shouldnâ€™t say 'Iâ€™m leaving',
you should say 'see you.'

394
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,446
I won't see you again no?

395
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:55,048
Okay, if you face any issue
there, use my name.

396
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,049
I have no problem.

397
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,017
But, it's a problem for me.

398
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,453
I will earn a job and come back.

399
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:01,388
Jogipet Srikanth... is no more.

400
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:02,990
Get used to calling me
Cyberabad Srikanth.

401
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,424
Donâ€™t keep calling me
asking if ate or slept,

402
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:05,425
and all those things.

403
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,034
Hey Manjula.

404
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,770
I lost my mind for you.

405
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:20,507
My sis-in-law,
I am your maternal bro-in-law.

406
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:26,613
Hey, what is all this?

407
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:27,781
Hello

408
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:29,650
I'm talking to you.

409
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,653
Can't you hear me? What are you doing?

410
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:33,320
Hey move man

411
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,354
Hey... hey... hey!

412
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:36,823
What is all this? Where are you going?

413
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,358
Hyderabad
-Hyderabad?

414
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,527
Nothing will happen because of you.

415
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:44,598
You don't have any respect at Jogipet.

416
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,368
What will you do after coming to Hyderabad?

417
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,806
Mama, I will cook rice.
-I will get the curries.

418
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,808
I was asking about the job man,

419
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:57,744
Mama, I donâ€™t have the narrow mind that
I will do only particular kind of job.

420
00:17:57,778 --> 00:17:59,112
I donâ€™t even want any salary mama.

421
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:00,681
If you give me food and shelter,
thatâ€™s enough.

422
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:04,151
It is better to give salary to you rather
than providing food and shelter.

423
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:07,020
I am going for a job
and to earn respect,

424
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,754
Why do you want all those?

425
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,056
Why do only you need a job and respect?

426
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:09,823
We need a job too.

427
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:11,558
Mama, please...

428
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:12,626
I'm out of money Mama.

429
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,728
I even sold my ring.

430
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:16,597
Hey, Ravi is here man.

431
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:18,165
So I need to sell my chain also then.

432
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,602
Letâ€™s go then.

433
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:21,935
Thu.

434
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,505
Please behave decently
like me in Hyderabad.

435
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:26,740
If you donâ€™t cook rice & curries,
I will kill you.

436
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,975
Regular or Basmati?

437
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,282
Where is our room, buddy?

438
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:38,285
You know Nagarjuna's (top Hero) Annapurna studios?

439
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,621
After crossing it you'll pass Chiranjeevi's
(another top hero) blood bank.

440
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,824
Beside that is our room, ROYAL VILLAS

441
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,427
It will be great
-Royal Villas...

442
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:48,996
Mama,

443
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,397
Annapurna Studios...

444
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:00,774
They sing a song from the
top hero Nagarjuna's film

445
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:02,309
Mama,

446
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:03,944
Chiranjeevi Blood bank...

447
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:18,625
Sing a song from top here Chiranjeevi's film

448
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:19,726
G...

449
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:20,561
A....

450
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:21,395
N....

451
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:22,296
G.....

452
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,363
Gang... gang...

453
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:39,012
Sounds of garbage collectors picking up trash

454
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:44,184
Sounds of people fighting in the slums.

455
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:46,253
Didn't you say Chiranjeevi and Nagarjuna?

456
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,156
Our adjoining house is
Chiranjeeviâ€™s house mama.

457
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:50,657
Both of us share the same current bill

458
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,192
Same?
-Curr ... Current ..

459
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,029
Even finding this in the colony is a lot.

460
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,431
Donâ€™t call this a colony, please.

461
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:09,409
Are you the people
who came here for the room?

462
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:10,110
Yeah.

463
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:12,479
Is this 'Royal Villas'?

464
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:13,280
Yep.

465
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:14,915
Royal?
-Royal

466
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,683
Royal
-Royal

467
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:20,687
Alcohol and girls,

468
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:21,922
don't bring them here.

469
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:23,023
Why? You will only provide us with them?

470
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:24,658
Come

471
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:26,894
Listen bhai,

472
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:28,595
Only one person can bathe a day,

473
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:29,630
There's a water problem here.

474
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,964
There's also a power problem

475
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:32,466
Only two people can sleep under the fan.

476
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,834
Just for the safe side,

477
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,170
WhatsApp me your Aadhar and voter ID.

478
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,738
Royal Villas is known for its neatness.

479
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:39,306
Should not behave like cheapskates.

480
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,875
Room should be maintained like
a well-polished mirror. Understood?

481
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:45,612
Mama, I will go to Jogipet.

482
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,581
I find it better than your house, Mama.

483
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:49,483
Daddy!

484
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:50,984
What happened dude?

485
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:51,752
No... No...

486
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:53,353
-What were you saying?
I dare you to say it again

487
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,255
No Anna
-Say it once again?

488
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:55,989
What happened?

489
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,624
Even if a room like this
has conditions and regulations,

490
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:59,026
I couldn't stand it, bro.

491
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:00,794
Let him go.

492
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:03,931
Get out of here.

493
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,433
How dare you beat my son?

494
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:08,435
I dare you to find a room here.

495
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:09,069
Get out of here.

496
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,238
Tell me.
-All because of you.

497
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,441
Mama, If you think
I'm the one causing the problem,

498
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,843
I will leave from here.

499
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:18,912
He's the one who gave the love letter
to my daughter on the road.

500
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:19,780
No, No.

501
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,849
I will pluck your eyes out
and tie them on the clock tower.

502
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:23,016
No, it was a small mistake.

503
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:23,750
What mistake?

504
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,018
This one was supposed to give the letter,
but by mistake that one gave it.

505
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,687
It's confusion, please drop it.

506
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,356
What? How dare you raise your hand?

507
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,992
All this is because of you.

508
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:32,793
Sir...
-Hey...

509
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:34,862
Mama, If you think
I'm the one causing the problem,

510
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:35,762
I will leave from here.

511
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:38,966
Mama, If you think
I'm the one causing the problem,

512
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,200
I will leave from here.

513
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,203
Mama, If you think
I'm the one causing the problem,

514
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:43,971
I will leave from here.

515
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:44,872
Leave me.

516
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:49,676
Where will we go now?

517
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:51,445
Why did you get so angry?

518
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:53,113
Mama, If you think
I'm the one causing the problem,

519
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,147
I will leave from here.

520
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:54,815
Go.

521
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:56,083
You're the one causing the problem.

522
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,086
I challenged my father and came here.

523
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:01,755
I canâ€™t go back to Jogipet with this face.

524
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,491
I'll be here whether I live or die.

525
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,026
So it looks like you're destined for death.

526
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:36,623
Nature

527
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,691
Jogging

528
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:38,859
Good morning.

529
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:39,960
Yeah

530
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:42,462
Hey

531
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,530
Wake up.

532
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:54,775
Where is our room, this time?

533
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:58,545
Mama, next to Ramanaidu Studios
(top film production studio in Hyderabad)

534
00:22:59,613 --> 00:23:03,183
Whistles a song from the top
film production house.

535
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:07,254
You dumb face.

536
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:32,479
Hello,
Is Praveen there?

537
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:33,714
Praveen?

538
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:34,848
Who Praveen?

539
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:36,350
What do you mean by 'Who Praveen?'

540
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,417
Yeah

541
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:39,853
Are you a guest in this apartment
that you don't know Praveen?

542
00:23:40,387 --> 00:23:42,155
Praveen, the star of Jogipet.

543
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:43,490
What nonsense are you talking.

544
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:44,691
Can't believe he doesn't know Praveen Anna.

545
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:47,628
A phenyl bottle a day?

546
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:48,996
Account for all of it.

547
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,398
You're lying through your noses.

548
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,567
I don't like it when people lie.

549
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:00,440
Anna, what are you doing here?

550
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:02,142
I'm doing accounts,
you ladies leave.

551
00:24:02,142 --> 00:24:03,544
We'll talk late, you leave.

552
00:24:04,411 --> 00:24:05,445
What is this lungi?

553
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:06,747
What happened to you?

554
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:09,416
Didn't you say you were a floor manager?

555
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,084
I mean I am a floor manager,

556
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,186
but not in the office.

557
00:24:12,352 --> 00:24:13,787
In this apartment.

558
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:15,189
Oh my.

559
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:17,691
I've been roaming around
speaking of

560
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:18,559
the star of Jogipet,
Praveen Anna.

561
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:20,827
And you're getting toilets cleaned?

562
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:23,096
You don't even have a tag?

563
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:25,799
I trusted you and came to Hyderabad,
after fighting with my father.

564
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,901
Saying I'd get a job in two months.

565
00:24:28,368 --> 00:24:30,003
Do you know that we slept
on the road the whole night?

566
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:31,004
What do you want me to then?

567
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:32,272
You spoke about some flats right,

568
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:34,174
Please look for a room
for us, temporarily.

569
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:35,142
I donâ€™t know anything man.

570
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:36,443
Please, just for a few days.

571
00:24:36,443 --> 00:24:37,544
We don't have a room to stay at,

572
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:39,012
We've been sleeping on the roads

573
00:24:39,046 --> 00:24:40,013
Ravi...

574
00:24:40,113 --> 00:24:41,315
Anna, 403 is vacant.

575
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,017
Anna, what was that?

576
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:45,085
-Uh... uh... nothing.

577
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:47,154
Didn't he just say that 403 was vacant?

578
00:24:47,187 --> 00:24:49,790
The owners have left for the U.S
for two months.

579
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:50,891
I'll stay there.

580
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:53,393
I'll clean the entire flat with phenyl,
better than you also.

581
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:55,529
These are very rich apartments

582
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:57,531
The owners of these apartments also don't live here.

583
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:58,665
That is this apartments range.

584
00:24:58,732 --> 00:24:59,666
We will stay in their place.

585
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,001
Hey, they wonâ€™t allow bachelors to stay here.

586
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,069
I will tell them I am married.

587
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:03,337
If they ask about your wife,
where from will you bring here?

588
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:04,538
I will tell them that I am a divorcee.

589
00:25:04,538 --> 00:25:07,307
Please Anna, 'tempovary'
- please, this will not be possible.

590
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:09,576
Get out of here, are you mad?

591
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:12,079
Okay, I will go.
-Go.

592
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:15,949
I have to go to the clock tower
and gossip about you phenyl

593
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:18,986
Jagdish Anna and others
will be at Majeera dam

594
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:19,820
An you girlfriend is there, right?

595
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,623
I have to tell about your lungi,
the tag, the phenyl and stuff.

596
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:23,357
Oh my, Lot of work is there.

597
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:24,558
Hey, why gossip about this in Jogipet?

598
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:25,392
Hey, no, no.

599
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:27,394
You want flat keys, right?
-No, please no -

600
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:29,229
Here, take them
-No, it's fine

601
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:30,497
We're both from Jogipet.
-Thanks brother.

602
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:36,870
Stop where that black car is.

603
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:40,974
Hello

604
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:43,043
Remove that vehicle.

605
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:45,345
Sir, Namaste
-Are you the watchman?

606
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:48,849
Were you sitting and
watching Tik Tok videos somewhere?

607
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:49,316
Where were you?

608
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:51,151
How did you let them park in Praveen Anna's spot?

609
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:52,786
Whose vehicle is this?
Go and bring him here.

610
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,121
No sir, please get down.

611
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:54,521
Go and call him.

612
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:57,357
Who is the wheelman who
parked his wheels here?

613
00:25:57,491 --> 00:25:59,626
Chakradhar or Chakrapani?
Who is that noble head? Go and bring him here.

614
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:00,327
Oh crap!!

615
00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:03,397
Sir? Is this your vehicle?

616
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:05,365
Hey, get down.
-How can you park in our space, sir?

617
00:26:05,365 --> 00:26:05,999
What the hell?

618
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:09,002
403, We have recently moved in.
We are your neighbors.

619
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:10,137
This is our parking.

620
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:11,705
403?

621
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,574
That means our neighbouring flat.

622
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:16,243
Which means you will stay along with us?

623
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:16,977
with us?

624
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:18,412
Why sir? What's wrong with you?

625
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,316
Hey security, who let them inside?

626
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:24,117
Who let that scrap metal of a car inside?

627
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:24,585
Sir!

628
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,020
Sir please don't
speak ill of the car,

629
00:26:27,054 --> 00:26:28,021
it's a very 'cos-metic' car

630
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:29,756
That's not a car, it's a garbage truck.

631
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:30,290
Hello sir,

632
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,125
You will not find a car
like that in Hyderabad.

633
00:26:32,526 --> 00:26:33,794
What kind of a car?

634
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:35,395
You think this is funny?

635
00:26:59,286 --> 00:26:59,786
Dad

636
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,821
You people are-

637
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:01,855
It's time for the exam.

638
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:02,689
You get into the car. I am coming.

639
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:04,358
Take your words back

640
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:05,325
Hey, stop.

641
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:07,861
That's some battered down car,
and we need a parking space for it.

642
00:27:08,328 --> 00:27:09,096
It's a Luna sir.

643
00:27:09,363 --> 00:27:11,532
It's fitted with auto tires
and run with a cycle chain.

644
00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:12,900
Hey, you potty mouth.

645
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:15,068
Sir to be a neighbour is to

646
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,637
offer our parking spot to you,

647
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:17,738
your turkey towels to us,

648
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,873
They lack the common sense to know this.

649
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:20,874
small town fellows.

650
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:22,176
I will explain it to them,
you carry on sir.

651
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:24,278
You are getting late for the exam,

652
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:25,979
I apologise on behalf of them.

653
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,247
Is she your daughter, sir?

654
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:30,884
I mean, I'm preparing for civils as well.

655
00:27:31,952 --> 00:27:33,020
Civils?

656
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,421
We're doing groups.

657
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:37,424
They wrote some exams
with a group of friends.

658
00:27:37,424 --> 00:27:38,892
They think that's what groups are,

659
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:39,960
I'll explain it to them sit,

660
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:41,295
The parking spot is yours, fix.

661
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:43,197
You carry on.

662
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:46,567
Go lick him, go.

663
00:28:10,557 --> 00:28:13,093
The petrol rates have increased a lot.

664
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:14,528
Why does that matter?

665
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,930
I always get hundred rupees filled.

666
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:28,509
Any experience?

667
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:31,745
Sorry, no vacancies.

668
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:33,680
Are these your certificates?

669
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:34,748
Yes sir.

670
00:28:35,015 --> 00:28:36,250
My certificates.

671
00:28:43,824 --> 00:28:45,025
Where is its knob?

672
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:48,395
Arey, it'll break.

673
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,498
Did they keep it below?

674
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:53,400
Hey, see this...

675
00:28:58,505 --> 00:29:01,542
Hey, place your hand here.

676
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:23,664
We are outside the office of
the winning party, Jana Balam

677
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:25,966
A crucial meeting regarding

678
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:29,002
the assignment of portfolios
is going to take place.

679
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,138
As you can see,
the party chief has just come.

680
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:31,805
Welcome sir.

681
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:32,439
Sir, sir.

682
00:29:32,806 --> 00:29:34,174
People are struggling without jobs.

683
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:34,675
Namaskar sir.

684
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:36,310
Older companies are shutting down.

685
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:37,678
Sir, they say it's because

686
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:40,848
You're giving the portfolios to
people without knowledge.

687
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:43,217
Yes, we've committed a few mistakes before.

688
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,786
This time we will
discuss it thoroughly

689
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,521
and allot the portfolios
to capable people.

690
00:29:47,654 --> 00:29:49,656
Sir then,
-Enough Madam

691
00:29:49,656 --> 00:29:50,624
We have a meeting inside....
-Sir,

692
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:52,025
Stop madam, please.

693
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,927
I wake up early every day,

694
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:55,629
and pray to the gods for 3 hours,

695
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:58,999
Please allot 'God Ministry' to me

696
00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:02,169
Sir, because I have understanding
about electronics and current

697
00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:03,871
Please give me 'Current Affairs' ministry

698
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:06,306
Current Affairs doesn't deal with current.

699
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:07,975
Is it related to affairs then?

700
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:10,978
Silence.

701
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:13,480
This time, ministries will be
given only to those,

702
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:14,982
who have complete knowledge and
understanding of the subject.

703
00:30:15,182 --> 00:30:17,017
The party should be caused a blemish.

704
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,253
As far as allotment of Revenue ministry goes,

705
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,287
It goes to

706
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:22,122
Chanakya

707
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:25,893
How can you give him Revenue sir?

708
00:30:26,793 --> 00:30:28,662
What experience does he have with Revenue?

709
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:31,031
And for people like me,
who've worked for so long in the party,

710
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:33,267
As you wish sir,

711
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:34,801
As you wish.

712
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:37,905
If you want, you can take sports ministry.

713
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:40,741
I don't want the ministry
that plays games.

714
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:43,544
As told by Ramchandraiah Sir,

715
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:46,547
I may not do justice to
the revenue ministry.

716
00:30:46,813 --> 00:30:47,648
Please don't mind.

717
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:50,617
If you donâ€™t mind,

718
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:52,419
I'll take the sports ministry
that he has rejected.

719
00:30:52,452 --> 00:30:53,387
I will be happy.

720
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:55,489
Actually, I am national level cricket player.

721
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:58,525
If my service is beneficial to the youth,
I will be happy.

722
00:30:59,426 --> 00:31:00,027
What?

723
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,621
Tell me.

724
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,123
No, you tell me.

725
00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:31,859
No, you tell me.

726
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,627
No, you tell me.

727
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,661
You tell me.

728
00:31:36,496 --> 00:31:37,497
You tell me.

729
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:38,765
you tell me.

730
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,800
You tell me.

731
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:41,134
Ouch,

732
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:42,169
What happened?

733
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:43,604
A mosquito bit me.

734
00:31:43,804 --> 00:31:45,038
Is there any blood?

735
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:46,106
Yes,

736
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,774
Your's or the mosquito's?

737
00:31:47,808 --> 00:31:49,710
Hey! mine.

738
00:31:50,377 --> 00:31:51,378
What else?

739
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:52,946
You tell me.

740
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,047
No, you tell me.

741
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:55,115
No, you tell me.

742
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:55,749
No you tell me,

743
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:57,885
What's the time on your watch?

744
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:58,919
9:30.

745
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,655
It's 9:35 on my watch, you know?

746
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:03,290
Guess where I am?

747
00:32:03,524 --> 00:32:04,525
You?

748
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,159
Ganesh Wines.

749
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,161
I have come to Hyderabad to meet you.

750
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:10,998
You're always lying.

751
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:12,299
M-Me?

752
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:13,133
Me?

753
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:14,935
M-
-Hello?

754
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:16,570
Your voice is breaking,

755
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,973
I will disconnect the call
and call you again.

756
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:22,576
This girl doesnâ€™t know the difference
between the signal and emotions

757
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:23,377
Mama,

758
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:25,646
I am thinking of giving this girl life.

759
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,080
By leaving her?

760
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:35,055
Mama, do you have a habit of
putting your legs over others?

761
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:36,723
No, why?
-I do.

762
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,058
Hey, move it.

763
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:39,226
I am in an imagination.

764
00:32:39,226 --> 00:32:39,960
Hey Ravi.

765
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,061
Hey, hey.

766
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:41,728
Hey, go.

767
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:42,329
Go out.

768
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:43,630
Mama, let's play a game.

769
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,331
What game?

770
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:45,299
I will put my leg over yours,

771
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,333
If you ask me to move it, you lose.

772
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,535
Hey, get out.

773
00:32:48,535 --> 00:32:50,337
Donâ€™t disturb my imagination, please.

774
00:32:50,537 --> 00:32:52,673
I wonder what you're running
in your imagination.

775
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:58,011
Don't worry.

776
00:32:58,378 --> 00:33:01,181
If the other person needs to think we know English,

777
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:02,516
Don't speak in English,

778
00:33:02,516 --> 00:33:03,250
Thatâ€™s all.

779
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:06,320
Sure, sure.

780
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:10,057
Yeah, Will check the father of the nation.

781
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:12,025
Ok check mail, Google mail, yahoo.

782
00:33:15,596 --> 00:33:16,663
We've just shifted here.

783
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:17,397
Neighbours.

784
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:23,403
If you ever need tamarind or curd,
you can ring our bell.

785
00:33:23,904 --> 00:33:26,173
I-I mea-mean- we can get acquainted

786
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:29,776
with lentils and salt in my house.

787
00:33:43,657 --> 00:33:44,591
My name is Srikanth.

788
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:49,530
I've seen you somewhere,
are you preparing for IAS?

789
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,764
I mean I am appearing for Civils.

790
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:54,368
You father said something the other day.

791
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:57,437
You father called you something.

792
00:33:57,437 --> 00:33:58,005
Lakshmi?

793
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:00,240
Kamakshi?

794
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:03,177
Champa?

795
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,779
-Champa?
-I will slap your cheek (champa).

796
00:34:07,414 --> 00:34:07,948
Sorry.

797
00:34:19,526 --> 00:34:20,194
Chitti?

798
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:24,198
Chitti is fixed- right I'm leaving.

799
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:42,950
Put all the goods in the go down outside.

800
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,818
Sir, sir. Hello sir.

801
00:34:45,118 --> 00:34:46,653
I have come for an interview, sir.

802
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:48,689
Here, there no jobs available here.

803
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:50,190
Sir, I will do any job,

804
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,291
Sir please see if there is any availability.

805
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:54,995
There have been no contracts for 6 months
and the work has stopped.

806
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:57,764
The owner is paying our salaries
from his own pockets.

807
00:34:57,998 --> 00:34:59,533
For you to get a job now will be very difficult.

808
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:01,768
I donâ€™t have problem even
if owner pays me from his own pocket, sir.

809
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:03,670
Sir,
-go, leave.

810
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,742
Forget about the payment of salaries.

811
00:35:09,243 --> 00:35:11,478
Apparently, you're not even able
to pay the electricity bills.

812
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,113
Think about it.

813
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:15,415
Nothing to think about.

814
00:35:16,383 --> 00:35:19,653
This company was founded by my father.

815
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,827
What can you offer,
India's first electronics company?

816
00:35:27,027 --> 00:35:28,662
all these long tales...

817
00:35:28,695 --> 00:35:31,865
Haven't received any orders
for the past year.

818
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:35,402
Before the bank forcefully
forfeit your company,

819
00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:38,272
Call us when you think of our offer.

820
00:35:38,772 --> 00:35:39,873
You can leave now.

821
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:43,377
Sir

822
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:46,246
that offer,

823
00:35:47,714 --> 00:35:48,448
I mean...

824
00:35:49,116 --> 00:35:51,185
you have to think about your family too, sir.

825
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:54,021
No Srinivas, we must not lose.

826
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:56,823
2000 people's lives.

827
00:35:57,724 --> 00:35:59,126
my fatherâ€™s dream,

828
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:01,461
I will not be defeated.

829
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:03,564
Here is your advance.

830
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,665
Advance?

831
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,000
Close it.

832
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:09,303
What is this?

833
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:10,270
Come here,

834
00:36:10,871 --> 00:36:14,474
I got some secret
information that

835
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:17,311
the Indo-Asian games are
taking place in our city.

836
00:36:17,544 --> 00:36:18,579
Oh my,

837
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:21,315
The plan is to give the
contract to their company,

838
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,617
a round figure of 500 crores will be ours.

839
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:24,685
500 crores?

840
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:26,186
If you are startled for everything,
I will punch you.

841
00:36:28,755 --> 00:36:31,859
If you take the oath as the
Sports Minister,

842
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:34,628
And sign that contract,

843
00:36:34,995 --> 00:36:37,497
the balance amount 400 crores
will be released.

844
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:41,401
I have waited all my life
for a chance like this.

845
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,872
Now there are no more
obstacles in the plan.

846
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:02,222
Don't know how she'll respond.

847
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,591
Psst..

848
00:37:05,826 --> 00:37:06,793
Psst..
Psst..

849
00:37:07,194 --> 00:37:08,328
What should I do?

850
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:09,429
*wolf whistles*

851
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:13,734
You said you'd slap me if I called
you the wrong name,

852
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:16,003
So I tried making a sound.

853
00:37:17,371 --> 00:37:18,805
You're Ratnamala right?

854
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:20,274
Huh?

855
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:24,578
Do you at least fill your
name out on admission forms?

856
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:26,313
Or do you keep them guessing?

857
00:37:26,613 --> 00:37:27,381
Chitti.

858
00:37:30,217 --> 00:37:30,784
Chitti.

859
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:32,386
How many times I have to tell you?

860
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:34,821
Don't record yourself dancing
and send it for auditions.

861
00:37:34,855 --> 00:37:36,156
What about my reputation?

862
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:36,990
Hello Sir,

863
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:38,759
What reputation sir?

864
00:37:39,393 --> 00:37:43,030
Could your reputation at least bag you
a fake 10th standard certificate?

865
00:37:44,698 --> 00:37:45,699
What shit...

866
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:47,034
No, so why does reputation matter sir?

867
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:51,839
Chitti, if you record your dance again
and send it for auditions,

868
00:37:51,872 --> 00:37:53,407
I will settle the American match for you
and pack you away

869
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:55,809
Sir, she's a dancing peacock sir.

870
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,645
Sir, your daughter is
â€œManikonda Madhuri Dixitâ€

871
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:01,014
Tie anklets to those legs,
not shackles sir.

872
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:04,084
Do you even know what you're talking about?

873
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:04,685
Sir,

874
00:38:05,652 --> 00:38:08,822
Sir, if she'd kicked you with
those legs when she was young...

875
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:10,824
-So what?
-So what?

876
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:13,060
So what?
-So what?

877
00:38:13,093 --> 00:38:14,194
-So...
Say something man.

878
00:38:14,194 --> 00:38:16,196
Finish the dialogue.

879
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:17,898
You can't understand your own daughter?

880
00:38:17,931 --> 00:38:20,334
What will you understand
if I finish my dialogue?

881
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:21,635
She is a small girl sir,

882
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:23,370
You need to understand her.

883
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:26,673
What she likes to study,
The boy she likes,

884
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:29,376
Chitti, who is this
half smoked cigarette butt to interfere?

885
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:29,977
Sir,

886
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,579
Sir, I am also responsible
citizen Kane of country

887
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:34,381
because of awareness
of 'Beti Bachao'.

888
00:38:34,915 --> 00:38:35,816
Oh Chitti--

889
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:39,953
Why are you in this place
with such indecent people?

890
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,855
I'm going crazy,

891
00:38:41,855 --> 00:38:43,991
Oh! What nonsense am I talking Chitti?

892
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:44,858
Come on, letâ€™s go.

893
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,127
My language has changed
after two minutes here.

894
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,730
Tie anklets to your daughterâ€™s legs
not shackles!

895
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:54,134
Once upon a time there was thirsty crow.

896
00:39:01,808 --> 00:39:04,044
No matter what, city beer is city beer.

897
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,414
Hi.

898
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:09,616
Oh god.

899
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:15,689
Uh...

900
00:39:15,956 --> 00:39:16,657
Hi.

901
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:17,324
Hi.

902
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:19,526
Is this yours?

903
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,461
It got delivered to our flat by mistake.

904
00:39:21,495 --> 00:39:22,829
Jogipet was written on it, so...

905
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:24,064
Oh. This is ours.

906
00:39:24,064 --> 00:39:25,032
Is it delivered to your flat?

907
00:39:25,065 --> 00:39:26,433
No problem.
-Thank you so much.

908
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:27,501
Okay I'm leaving.

909
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:29,469
Have a beer -
c-c-c-coffee and leave

910
00:39:29,503 --> 00:39:30,637
No, not now, another time.

911
00:39:30,637 --> 00:39:32,739
It's the first time you've come here.
Just five minutes.

912
00:39:33,006 --> 00:39:33,507
Come.

913
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,341
Okay.

914
00:39:39,346 --> 00:39:40,414
What do you do?

915
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:42,216
Ladies emporiu...
-Empowerment.

916
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:47,254
Ladies empowerment.

917
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,455
I do as much as I can for it.

918
00:39:48,488 --> 00:39:49,523
I keep trying.

919
00:39:50,324 --> 00:39:51,291
You are great.

920
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:52,926
What about your job?

921
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:54,862
Currently I'm struggling.

922
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,297
You Sir?

923
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:00,934
I am also struggling.

924
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:02,970
And you?

925
00:40:03,437 --> 00:40:05,138
I have been struggling from my childhood.

926
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:08,609
Our parents do not trust us.

927
00:40:08,642 --> 00:40:11,144
When I passed my 10th class,
my father did not believe it.

928
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:12,379
He was shocked.

929
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:13,914
Why your father, even I was also shocked.

930
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:17,618
He's always ready to crack
jokes in front of girls,

931
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:20,053
Like a dog in front of a mutton shop.

932
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:22,756
Hey, I will put on some rice, not coffee

933
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:24,391
Heat the morning's coffee and serve it.

934
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:27,427
Mama, the girl came home!

935
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:31,031
And from tomorrow onwards,

936
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:34,067
I'll be a Banjara Hills
(posh locality in Hyderabad) son-in-law.

937
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:40,007
Now we can delete Jogipet from our life.

938
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:42,543
You don't know what delete means right?

939
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:43,510
It means remove.

940
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,212
Donâ€™t behave like Jogipet
boy before that girl,

941
00:40:45,245 --> 00:40:46,613
behave a well-mannered
man like me.

942
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,881
I prepared it.
-Thanks.

943
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:49,583
Only one.
-Oh, sorry.

944
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:55,022
This apartment suits me well.

945
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:58,725
I would like to settle in
this Hyderabad climate.

946
00:40:58,725 --> 00:40:59,660
Is it?
-Yes.

947
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:02,596
But I want to settle in a village.

948
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:05,666
Tell me if your Jogipet is good,

949
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:07,768
I will take a farmhouse
and settle there.

950
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:09,570
When would he go back to Jogipet?

951
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:11,004
He deleted it long back.

952
00:41:11,905 --> 00:41:12,639
Your face-

953
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,008
Jogipet is Jogipet.

954
00:41:17,845 --> 00:41:19,646
Some rando-
Oh, it's my father.

955
00:41:20,113 --> 00:41:21,315
-Sorry, one minute.
-Yeah.. yeah..

956
00:41:22,783 --> 00:41:23,550
Hello father.

957
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:25,252
Did you open the package?

958
00:41:25,285 --> 00:41:27,120
Yeah, it's here,
What did you send?

959
00:41:31,191 --> 00:41:32,960
On the eve of
the Ladies' Festival,

960
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,894
we want to invite all
the married women...

961
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:35,529
and want to open
a ladiesâ€™ emporium

962
00:41:35,562 --> 00:41:36,697
by the name â€œSrikanth
ladiesâ€™ emporiumâ€

963
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:37,431
What do you say?

964
00:41:37,464 --> 00:41:38,332
Yeah, yeah.

965
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:40,133
I will tell you.

966
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,972
If you send photos like these again,
I will kill you.

967
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:45,973
I am in a meeting.

968
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:48,442
Hey-all these ladies are
waiting for you here.

969
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:49,910
Cut the call.

970
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:51,211
Oh man.

971
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:53,747
Yes, father your blessings
are enough for me.

972
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:54,948
Right.

973
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:57,484
My father.

974
00:41:58,252 --> 00:42:01,455
He asks me to do things I don't like.
It's difficult for me.

975
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:03,156
What does your father do?

976
00:42:03,624 --> 00:42:05,125
Aaaa... Army.

977
00:42:06,426 --> 00:42:08,228
Idiot, take some medicine

978
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:09,396
Sorry

979
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,265
He says that I have an army body.

980
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:15,402
Something happened to him, check on him

981
00:42:15,802 --> 00:42:17,471
Just because somebody
has an army body

982
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,705
does that mean they
have to join the army?

983
00:42:19,106 --> 00:42:20,574
He doesn't listen to me.
What do you do?

984
00:42:21,308 --> 00:42:23,076
I like to dance a lot.

985
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:26,480
But I'm doing some other
course for my father.

986
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:29,416
But I have zero knowledge in it as well.

987
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:31,585
I just cheat and pass my exams.

988
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:32,085
Is it?

989
00:42:33,287 --> 00:42:35,189
Even I'm crazy about dancing.

990
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:36,023
Is it?

991
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:38,425
There's not a single
function in town where I don't dance.

992
00:42:39,193 --> 00:42:42,362
Vijayawada, Marpha, Teenmar
(local dance forms)

993
00:42:42,362 --> 00:42:44,231
I am trained in everything.

994
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:45,365
Trained?

995
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:45,899
Yes.

996
00:42:51,538 --> 00:42:53,807
That's a very exciting sound for him.

997
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:57,845
Tea is very tasty, but...

998
00:42:58,245 --> 00:42:59,346
That is coffee.

999
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:03,584
You seem like a really good man.

1000
00:43:04,017 --> 00:43:06,987
People would think you're a good man,
looking at you.

1001
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:08,155
Huh?
-huh?

1002
00:43:08,455 --> 00:43:09,623
What do you mean?

1003
00:43:10,224 --> 00:43:11,725
I'm really a good man.

1004
00:43:11,725 --> 00:43:14,595
Go type 'goodness' on Google,

1005
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:16,096
The results will show 'searching for Srikanth'.

1006
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,165
Okay bye, Vishnupriya.

1007
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:18,732
Hey..

1008
00:43:18,732 --> 00:43:20,267
Sorry, is it Krishna Veni right?

1009
00:43:22,336 --> 00:43:23,170
Okay

1010
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:26,406
How come you called me Chitti that day?

1011
00:43:26,406 --> 00:43:28,141
You want me to you tell the truth?

1012
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:31,445
I don't know why, but I felt like
calling you Chitti when I saw you.

1013
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:34,915
Is it a problem?

1014
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,988
If not, can I call you Pinki?

1015
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:43,724
That is...

1016
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:49,429
My Chitti,

1017
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:52,733
Shamili...

1018
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:54,368
Shamili...

1019
00:43:56,036 --> 00:43:58,805
My name is not Shamili.

1020
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:00,207
My name is Chitti.

1021
00:44:01,074 --> 00:44:02,509
Amma!

1022
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:15,088
There's nobody there to call you
Chitti anymore.

1023
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:23,864
Chitti.

1024
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:40,180
Sorry.

1025
00:44:46,053 --> 00:44:48,155
Hello sir, have you received your package?

1026
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:50,190
I will take it if you give it to me.

1027
00:44:50,224 --> 00:44:52,059
What sir? How can you suspect me?

1028
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:54,294
We're a family that would
give our lives for loyalty.

1029
00:44:54,294 --> 00:44:55,229
So you won't give packages?

1030
00:44:57,598 --> 00:44:58,432
Shamili madam.

1031
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:00,968
You took the package from me
to give it to sir,

1032
00:45:01,134 --> 00:45:01,969
Didn't you give it to him?

1033
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:05,405
You said it was delivered
to your flat by mistake.

1034
00:45:08,609 --> 00:45:09,142
Hey.

1035
00:45:10,277 --> 00:45:11,278
Oh my.

1036
00:45:14,348 --> 00:45:16,416
Will you give your number
by mistake as well, Shamili?

1037
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:21,622
It's okay. You can call me Chitti.

1038
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,725
Oh chitti your smile

1039
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:27,561
Is an atomic missile

1040
00:45:27,594 --> 00:45:29,830
When it goes off

1041
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:31,999
My heart gets shattered

1042
00:45:32,165 --> 00:45:36,870
When you twist and turn around,

1043
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:41,275
It's like a signal that you approve of me.

1044
00:45:41,308 --> 00:45:42,876
Yes you've come into my sight

1045
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:47,781
In my darkest night

1046
00:45:47,814 --> 00:45:49,616
And turned on a flood light

1047
00:45:49,783 --> 00:45:51,919
I've started to like you.

1048
00:45:51,952 --> 00:45:54,321
And I like you a lot.

1049
00:45:54,354 --> 00:45:56,890
I was just a guy who's black and white

1050
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:59,693
You filled me with colors so bright

1051
00:45:59,693 --> 00:46:00,894
O chitti my bulbul chitti

1052
00:46:01,128 --> 00:46:01,962
Hi

1053
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:02,496
Hi.

1054
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:04,264
Chitti, I have to tell you something

1055
00:46:05,032 --> 00:46:05,732
Tell me.

1056
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:07,234
But you shouldn't mind it.

1057
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:09,002
I won't mind.

1058
00:46:09,403 --> 00:46:10,003
Tell me.

1059
00:46:10,003 --> 00:46:11,305
No. you will definitely mind.

1060
00:46:11,305 --> 00:46:12,639
It's okay. Tell me.

1061
00:46:13,073 --> 00:46:15,108
I told you I have to tell you something,

1062
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:17,344
And told you not to mind,

1063
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:19,546
And you still don't
know what's in my heart?

1064
00:46:21,381 --> 00:46:23,483
Even when you're so hesitant

1065
00:46:23,684 --> 00:46:25,819
I'm telling you I won't mind

1066
00:46:26,386 --> 00:46:29,456
Yet, you canâ€™t understand
what's in my heart?

1067
00:46:31,425 --> 00:46:32,426
Aye, Chitti

1068
00:46:33,427 --> 00:46:34,361
Chitti

1069
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:39,132
Sweetheart!

1070
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,202
Son-in-law of Banjara hills.

1071
00:46:42,236 --> 00:46:42,870
Come here.

1072
00:46:43,604 --> 00:46:44,238
Come here bey!

1073
00:46:57,985 --> 00:46:58,452
Hey....

1074
00:46:59,453 --> 00:46:59,920
Hey....

1075
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:05,893
How many movies havenâ€™t
we seen this scene in?

1076
00:47:06,527 --> 00:47:08,862
You stare angrily
in the beginning.

1077
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:10,397
Then you slowly come dancing.

1078
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:11,865
Right?

1079
00:47:12,399 --> 00:47:13,567
Come on sir. come.

1080
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,401
Hey

1081
00:47:14,768 --> 00:47:15,769
-Get out bey.
Sorry sir, sorry.

1082
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:18,272
No battles were fought

1083
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:20,607
No horses were slashed

1084
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:23,243
Just with your sweet smile

1085
00:47:23,277 --> 00:47:25,179
You made me victorious

1086
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:26,880
You are queen Elizabeth

1087
00:47:26,914 --> 00:47:30,651
And I am a just a nobody

1088
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:32,819
I fixed the carbonator sir.

1089
00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:36,890
But you still voted for my common man heart

1090
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:38,392
Come on sir,

1091
00:47:38,392 --> 00:47:40,127
Ride our vehicles to once in a while.

1092
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,296
And booked a flight
from your palace to my slums

1093
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:42,763
It's nice.

1094
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:46,667
It would be great if someone
called me right now.

1095
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:48,035
Heh?

1096
00:47:50,337 --> 00:47:52,172
Hey. I am at Taj Banjara,
will call you later.

1097
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:54,107
Right!

1098
00:47:55,576 --> 00:47:56,510
I've said it.

1099
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,745
You're like Google maps,

1100
00:47:58,779 --> 00:48:00,781
And showed me the way to your heart

1101
00:48:01,148 --> 00:48:06,053
O you gave off your heart to me!

1102
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:10,357
You've become a an onion garnish
to my fritter like life

1103
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,626
You've pierced my heart,

1104
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:14,962
O you pierced me
with your love tattoo so deep!

1105
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:17,064
You sprinkled a delicious lemon

1106
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:20,267
In my biryani

1107
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,569
O chitti my bulbul chitti

1108
00:48:22,603 --> 00:48:24,571
Chitti my chulbul chitti

1109
00:48:24,605 --> 00:48:27,975
When you squeeze both my cheeks to kiss

1110
00:48:28,008 --> 00:48:29,476
I lose my balance

1111
00:48:29,543 --> 00:48:31,778
Oh chitti my jiljil chitti

1112
00:48:31,812 --> 00:48:34,147
Chitti my redbull chitti

1113
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:39,219
You've hit a million likes

1116
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:49,796
To avoid any bad name to the party,

this esteemed organization.

1122

Donâ€™t say that Sir. Please.
Just one job, Sir.

1123
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:09,616
You made it. Thatâ€™s what I am saying no?

1124
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:11,251
Donâ€™t say â€˜noâ€™ Sir. Please.

1125
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:14,054
I am in a lot of trouble right now.
Sir, just one job.

1126
00:49:14,054 --> 00:49:15,656
Hey, you got the job.

1127
00:49:17,324 --> 00:49:18,158

1128
00:49:18,192 --> 00:49:18,792

Now you forget about the company Sir.

00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:30,737
It's been long since we've drank.

1133
00:49:30,737 --> 00:49:32,673
You drank right in front of me.

1134
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:34,241
I am the number one.

1135
00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:35,776
Offer letter.

1136
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,248
Life is set Mama

1137
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:43,083
Next marriage with Chitti,

1138
00:49:43,116 --> 00:49:45,452
children, their milk bottles...

1139
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:46,954
Everything will start now.

1140
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:48,522
What did my dad say?

1141
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:50,290
Two months challenge it seems.

1142
00:49:50,424 --> 00:49:52,626
I will appear in front of my
dad, with a tag,

1143
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:54,428
two months before
the challenge is done.

1144
00:49:54,428 --> 00:49:56,296
Bro, my life is also set Mama

1145
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:57,798
Suvarna said she'd
meet me tomorrow

1146
00:49:57,798 --> 00:49:59,666
at 10 oâ€™clock in Lumbini Park.

1147
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:02,769
What happened dude?

1148
00:50:03,136 --> 00:50:05,939
My life has stopped at
cooking rice and getting curries.

1149
00:50:08,575 --> 00:50:09,176
Who is it dude?

1150
00:50:09,977 --> 00:50:12,179
Janardhan from Jogipeta.

1151
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:13,046
Jana...

1152
00:50:14,114 --> 00:50:15,349
disconnect the phone.

1153
00:50:15,983 --> 00:50:17,851
We have settled in Banjara Hills.

1154
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:19,786
Do not pick up phone calls from
people who have not settled in life.

1155
00:50:20,087 --> 00:50:20,988
Please, cut the call.

1156
00:50:21,755 --> 00:50:23,490
Will you not answer our calls also now?

1157
00:50:24,224 --> 00:50:27,661
Your- phone- my- friend- ship-

1158
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:31,732
Mama,, I can't sleep at night thinking
about how to settle you guy.

1159
00:50:33,467 --> 00:50:35,068
Don't worry Mama.

1160
00:50:35,102 --> 00:50:36,737
I will help you come up in life.

1161
00:50:37,104 --> 00:50:39,473
Stop it mama, what can you do?

1162
00:50:39,473 --> 00:50:40,874
Have you done anything for us

1163
00:50:40,908 --> 00:50:42,209
other than disrespecting
us before our fathers?

1164
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:43,777
Tell me what you did for us?

1165
00:50:43,844 --> 00:50:44,378
Tell me.

1166
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:45,345
Didnâ€™t I do anything, bro?

1167
00:50:45,345 --> 00:50:46,914
Tell me, What did you do?
-Tell me what did you do?

1168
00:50:47,314 --> 00:50:49,183
Oh so I didn't do anything?

1169
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:52,186
27th March 2008

1170
00:50:53,086 --> 00:50:54,655
Nataraj Theatre, Sangareddy

1171
00:50:55,455 --> 00:50:57,090
On the release day of the movie Jalsa

1172
00:50:57,658 --> 00:50:59,493
I was at the balcony,

1173
00:50:59,526 --> 00:51:00,694
you sat on the floor
with a 10 rupees ticket.

1174
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:03,030
Didn't I bring you up that day?

1175
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:04,631
Huh?

1176
00:51:05,432 --> 00:51:06,800
Thatâ€™s my nature Mama.

1177
00:51:06,867 --> 00:51:09,636
Hey, Salman Khanâ€™s shooting
is going on at London.

1178
00:51:09,636 --> 00:51:12,673
He said he will not shoot
until my biryani arrives,

1179
00:51:12,706 --> 00:51:15,242
Send it to him fast mama.

1180
00:51:18,145 --> 00:51:19,780
I'm an international personality,

1181
00:51:19,813 --> 00:51:21,281
You canâ€™t go sir.

1182
00:51:23,183 --> 00:51:25,052
What man? The rice is not cooked?

1183
00:51:25,118 --> 00:51:26,620
It's cooked Anna, feel it.

1184
00:51:26,653 --> 00:51:28,055
What happened? Why are you so late?

1185
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:29,923
Did you stuck in old city traffic?

1186
00:51:31,592 --> 00:51:32,292
Hello.

1187
00:51:32,726 --> 00:51:34,361
Do I look like I'm from the old city?

1188
00:51:34,494 --> 00:51:37,197
Hey. One more message.

1189
00:51:37,397 --> 00:51:38,665
Whose message?

1190
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:39,933
From Ivanka Trump.

1191
00:51:39,967 --> 00:51:40,968
What does she say?

1192
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:42,836
I will tell you what she's saying.

1193
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,172
â€œHi Saleem, where are you?"

1194
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:47,274
"How are you? I miss you?"

1195
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:50,711
"Please make stone mutton for meâ€

1196
00:51:51,011 --> 00:51:52,346
Ha, what is stone mutton?

1197
00:51:53,013 --> 00:51:54,648
Pathar ka Gosht you dumbass.

1198
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:54,982
Okay.

1199
00:51:54,982 --> 00:51:57,317
I am not an old city man.

1200
00:51:57,317 --> 00:51:59,920
I am coming from London,
from charter plane.

1201
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:02,256
Mr. Chanakya sir has called me
for a special order.

1202
00:52:02,256 --> 00:52:03,156
For what?

1203
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:04,625
Special order.

1204
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:09,129
Make it fast.

1205
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:10,697
Hello...

1206
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:13,233
Hah... Mr. Putin.

1207
00:52:13,267 --> 00:52:15,435
Hey, they are cooking
Murgh musallam in party.

1208
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:16,436
Can we go please?

1209
00:52:16,436 --> 00:52:18,405
They'll have foreign liquor
Let's go.

1210
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:19,606
Hey, hands off.

1211
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,075
Can't you be serious in life?

1212
00:52:22,543 --> 00:52:23,510
Whose party is that?

1213
00:52:23,877 --> 00:52:25,646
Did they invite you?
Will the mind?

1214
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:26,914
Don't you think of these things?

1215
00:52:27,214 --> 00:52:29,249
Have you left your manners at Jogipeta?

1216
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,651
Thu.

1217
00:52:31,451 --> 00:52:32,386
Because of people like you,

1218
00:52:32,419 --> 00:52:33,987
the country has turned into
a third class compartment.

1219
00:52:33,987 --> 00:52:35,088
Hey, Srikanth arenâ€™t you
coming to party at night?

1220
00:52:35,088 --> 00:52:36,456
-Ready. Waiting for you.

1221
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:38,158
Common bro.
-Hands off.

1222
00:52:38,192 --> 00:52:39,660
You and your bloody life.

1223
00:52:43,864 --> 00:52:45,065
Hey!
-Neighbours!

1224
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:48,035
Mama, we need to eat â€œMurgh Musallamâ€

1225
00:52:48,068 --> 00:52:49,670
Full enjoy, Mama,

1226
00:52:49,703 --> 00:52:51,738
This politician has a lot of money.

1227
00:52:54,474 --> 00:52:55,876
Was your journey comfortable?

1228
00:52:55,876 --> 00:52:58,111
We live next door, you dimwit...

1229
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,481
Chitti

1230
00:53:01,515 --> 00:53:02,115
-Hey, letâ€™s go, bro.

1231
00:53:02,149 --> 00:53:03,617
Hey, â€œMurgh Musallamâ€

1232
00:53:03,617 --> 00:53:04,418
â€œMurgh Musallamâ€

1233
00:53:04,418 --> 00:53:05,118
Seriously
-Chitti

1234
00:53:05,752 --> 00:53:06,520
Hi

1235
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,021
What are you doing here?

1236
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:09,022
The mutton is over there.

1237
00:53:09,056 --> 00:53:10,524
Excuse me.

1238
00:53:10,624 --> 00:53:11,625
-Chintu.

1239
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:16,897
Your saree is very nice.

1240
00:53:17,564 --> 00:53:18,131
Thanks.

1241
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:19,466
But the bangles do not match

1242
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:20,567
Why did you wear those bangles?

1243
00:53:20,968 --> 00:53:21,468
Oh my!

1244
00:53:21,668 --> 00:53:23,003
What do you know about matching?

1245
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:24,671
Let it be.

1246
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:25,572
What are you saying?

1247
00:53:25,606 --> 00:53:27,107
He's the only person who knows
about matching in Jogipet-

1248
00:53:27,107 --> 00:53:28,342
â€œMurgh Musallamâ€

1249
00:53:28,342 --> 00:53:29,943
Saleem's you said you'd eat it right.

1250
00:53:29,977 --> 00:53:30,844
Go, go.

1251
00:53:32,112 --> 00:53:33,647
the blanket hall is very nice.

1252
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:36,283
Srikanth, it's called a banquet hall.

1253
00:53:37,317 --> 00:53:39,353
I only said that so that
he could understand.

1254
00:53:39,987 --> 00:53:41,889
Go and drink,
you said you would drink.

1255
00:53:42,422 --> 00:53:43,223
Go...

1256
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:46,260
Take it and go.

1257
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,528
and donâ€™t come back for a while.

1258
00:53:47,594 --> 00:53:49,630
You donâ€™t want?
-No, donâ€™t come back again.

1259
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:50,364
Okay.

1260
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,169
Your saree is very nice.

1261
00:53:56,637 --> 00:53:58,572
It suits you very well.
-Thanks...

1262
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:02,743
Remove those bangles, please.
They don't match.

1263
00:54:04,878 --> 00:54:05,712
It's okay, wear it.

1264
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,881
Do you drink alcohol?

1265
00:54:07,915 --> 00:54:11,618
MLA Chanakya...
-Zindabad

1266
00:54:11,618 --> 00:54:14,188
Hello, if Ramachandraiah doesn't
become the Sports Minister

1267
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:15,756
Do you think he'd leave politics and
become an ascetic?

1268
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:18,425
When he can do politics
with the ascetics itself,

1269
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:19,826
why would he leave politics
to become an ascetic?

1270
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,794
Thatâ€™s it.

1271
00:54:21,495 --> 00:54:22,296
Brother,
-What?

1272
00:54:22,296 --> 00:54:23,497
It's late, cut the cake quickly.

1273
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:24,231
Aah... okay.

1274
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:25,966
Sing the birthday song.

1275
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:30,938
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

1276
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:34,174
Stop..

1277
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:35,475
Who do you want?

1278
00:54:35,509 --> 00:54:36,343
Who are you?

1279
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:40,080
I have to meet Chanakya sir.

1280
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:41,815
My brother is busy.

1281
00:54:42,082 --> 00:54:43,183
Come in later.

1282
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:44,384
I am Chanakya...

1283
00:54:45,319 --> 00:54:45,919
Please come.

1284
00:54:48,322 --> 00:54:49,456
Hello sir
-Hello

1285
00:54:50,891 --> 00:54:51,758
No problem.

1286
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:55,829
I'm from Swatantra Electronics company.

1287
00:54:55,963 --> 00:54:56,663
Good

1288
00:54:56,697 --> 00:55:00,534
The first electronics company in India.

1289
00:55:00,567 --> 00:55:04,838
The currently, the situation is really bad.

1290
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:07,908
The company has reached
the stage of foreclosure.

1291
00:55:07,975 --> 00:55:08,475
Good

1292
00:55:08,542 --> 00:55:10,644
Nothing. Sorry. Tell me.

1293
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:12,713
2000 employees,

1294
00:55:12,746 --> 00:55:15,282
I came to you hoping you'd help me.

1295
00:55:16,016 --> 00:55:17,284
To foreclose the company?

1296
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:19,353
No, no.

1297
00:55:19,419 --> 00:55:23,223
You are the future Sports Minister.

1298
00:55:23,323 --> 00:55:25,826
In the upcoming Indo-Asian games,

1299
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,028
If you help us get one contract.

1300
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:31,798
If you could just get us one contract,

1301
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:34,801
you would become a savior
to a lot of people, sir.

1302
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:37,905
All these old Indian
companies are shutting down.

1303
00:55:38,705 --> 00:55:41,475
People are just buying
Chinese and Korean manufactured parts.

1304
00:55:42,276 --> 00:55:42,876
True.

1305
00:55:43,076 --> 00:55:44,411
Anyway,

1306
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:46,947
there's khaddu ka
kheer in the buffet

1307
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:48,649
It's really good.

1308
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:50,384
Eat it and leave.

1309
00:55:51,084 --> 00:55:51,552
Go...

1310
00:55:54,955 --> 00:55:56,056
Hey, get me a Drink.

1311
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:59,293
Sir, if you want,

1312
00:56:01,595 --> 00:56:02,863
If you want..

1313
00:56:02,896 --> 00:56:03,463
One...

1314
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:04,631
One...

1315
00:56:06,867 --> 00:56:07,434
One...

1316
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:09,169
I will give you one crore rupees sir.

1317
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,905
one contract, sir,

1318
00:56:11,939 --> 00:56:13,674
only 1 contract sir, please.

1319
00:56:14,675 --> 00:56:15,976
How much did you say, sir?

1320
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:18,011
One crore rupees sir....

1321
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:32,726
With one crore rupees,
you cannot even buy a counselor, sir.

1322
00:56:33,327 --> 00:56:34,094
Namaste sir

1323
00:56:38,465 --> 00:56:39,466
Listen,

1324
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,301
What did you think of me
when you first saw me?

1325
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:43,237
Do you want the truth?

1326
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,271
Yes.

1327
00:56:44,505 --> 00:56:46,340
I thought, you were good for nothing.

1328
00:56:46,373 --> 00:56:47,374
Huh?

1329
00:56:49,009 --> 00:56:50,744
Does that mean you still think that?

1330
00:56:51,645 --> 00:56:52,880
Why do we need to talk
about those things right now?

1331
00:56:56,884 --> 00:56:57,751
Any drinks sir?

1332
00:56:57,784 --> 00:56:58,418
Yeah.

1333
00:56:58,986 --> 00:57:00,220
Do you want to drink?

1334
00:57:00,621 --> 00:57:02,322
Uh...French wine.

1335
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:03,156
French wine with?

1336
00:57:03,156 --> 00:57:05,225
French wine with English subtitles.

1337
00:57:06,093 --> 00:57:08,362
Two minutes sir,
I will take one byte and come out.

1338
00:57:08,362 --> 00:57:10,063
Not allowed. There is protocol to follow.
-Please sir.

1339
00:57:10,063 --> 00:57:11,131
I don't drink alcohol,

1340
00:57:11,131 --> 00:57:12,299
This is very important sir, please understand sir.
-I told you it's not possible.

1341
00:57:12,366 --> 00:57:13,867
Just two minutes, only one byte.
-Move aside, sir will not agree.

1342
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:14,535
Sir

1343
00:57:14,535 --> 00:57:15,802
Prasad.
-Sir

1344
00:57:15,836 --> 00:57:17,437
Let her come.
-Okay sir.

1345
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,741
Excuse me.

1346
00:57:21,575 --> 00:57:22,109
Hi Sir...

1347
00:57:22,342 --> 00:57:22,843
Hi

1348
00:57:23,043 --> 00:57:25,546
I've been trying to meet you for a while.

1349
00:57:25,646 --> 00:57:27,948
I am very excited to meet you sir.

1350
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:30,417
Such a young Sports Minister

1351
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:32,853
If you spare some time,

1352
00:57:32,886 --> 00:57:34,488
I want to talk to
you personally.

1353
00:57:34,521 --> 00:57:36,290
Yeah, shall we get a room?

1354
00:57:36,757 --> 00:57:37,291
Okay.

1355
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:44,565
I've looked it up on Google.

1356
00:57:44,565 --> 00:57:45,465
This is local liquor.

1357
00:57:45,499 --> 00:57:46,834
where's the foreign liquor?

1358
00:57:46,834 --> 00:57:47,534
Keep your hands off.

1359
00:57:47,568 --> 00:57:48,969
Foreign liquor, hey,

1360
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:50,504
Sir, table.

1361
00:57:50,671 --> 00:57:51,705
Sir,
-Come here.

1362
00:57:51,738 --> 00:57:53,440
Sir don't
-Where is the foreign liquor?

1363
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:56,410
I am the real Arjun Reddy

1364
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:57,177
Fake Vijay Devarakonda

1365
00:57:57,211 --> 00:57:58,779
You are Mallikarjun Reddy

1366
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:00,414
You're from the country liquor batch

1367
00:58:00,447 --> 00:58:01,081
You're too drunk

1368
00:58:01,114 --> 00:58:04,017
Who's too drunk man?
I can drink one more bottle.

1369
00:58:04,017 --> 00:58:04,451
Like you would.

1370
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:04,985
Go and sleep.

1371
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:05,986
Donâ€™t create a mess.

1372
00:58:05,986 --> 00:58:08,155
they are checking outside.
-What are you saying?

1373
00:58:08,222 --> 00:58:08,655
Hey!

1374
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:11,592
I can both die and kill for alcohol.

1375
00:58:11,592 --> 00:58:12,459
Go die.

1376
00:58:12,526 --> 00:58:13,861
Ravi is here!

1377
00:58:21,201 --> 00:58:22,903
This is the uncle next door
who plays cricket right?

1378
00:58:22,936 --> 00:58:23,904
Chanakya sir...

1379
00:58:24,304 --> 00:58:25,005
Can you hear us?

1380
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:26,206
What is this blood?

1381
00:58:26,206 --> 00:58:26,507
Sir, sir,

1382
00:58:26,507 --> 00:58:27,674
what did you do to him?

1383
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:29,843
I opened the door in
front of your eyes, right?

1384
00:58:29,877 --> 00:58:31,245
What do I know?

1385
00:58:31,245 --> 00:58:32,813
He's fallen down at the wrong entrance.

1386
00:58:32,846 --> 00:58:34,314
Can you go to your flat please?

1387
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:35,716
Pick him up.

1388
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:37,484
Did anyone see?

1389
00:58:38,652 --> 00:58:39,820
What do we do now?

1390
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,222
What can we do? Throw him out.

1391
00:58:42,256 --> 00:58:43,390
Why do we need to care about him?

1392
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:45,025
Hey, check if he's alive.

1393
00:58:45,392 --> 00:58:46,326
I will go get water.

1394
00:58:47,327 --> 00:58:49,429
Has he ever offered us alcohol or fed us?

1395
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:51,598
There is no water in the house.

1396
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:52,633
Move.

1397
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,168
What happened?

1398
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:57,004
Died?

1399
00:58:58,105 --> 00:58:59,006
Oh God!

1400
00:58:59,173 --> 00:59:01,542
Sir not here please.

1401
00:59:01,575 --> 00:59:02,209
not in our house, sir.

1402
00:59:02,242 --> 00:59:03,410
Hey, thereâ€™s that thing,

1403
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:04,745
where they blow into
the mouth and kiss them,

1404
00:59:04,745 --> 00:59:05,646
Will he live if we do that?

1405
00:59:05,646 --> 00:59:07,548
Would you live if
you put your mouth in his?

1406
00:59:08,715 --> 00:59:09,950
Now what we have to do?
I am worried.

1407
00:59:09,983 --> 00:59:11,585
Please don't worry Mama, please.

1408
00:59:11,652 --> 00:59:13,620
Cool, cool, let's think it out coolly.

1409
00:59:13,654 --> 00:59:13,954
Hey...

1410
00:59:13,987 --> 00:59:15,556
What do we have to think about?

1411
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:16,623
Letâ€™s cut him into pieces

1412
00:59:16,657 --> 00:59:17,958
And throw him at Parsigutta.

1413
00:59:18,025 --> 00:59:19,026
Hey, you shut up.

1414
00:59:22,296 --> 00:59:24,364
Forget all this, let's call the police.

1415
00:59:25,132 --> 00:59:27,434
If we call police,
they may suspect that we have killed him

1416
00:59:27,467 --> 00:59:28,569
and arrest us.

1417
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:30,404
Hey Shekar.

1418
00:59:30,404 --> 00:59:30,938
What do we do?

1419
00:59:30,938 --> 00:59:32,573
My phone switched off.
give your phone once, I will call Suvarna.

1420
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:33,841
Your goddamn Suvarna.

1421
00:59:34,942 --> 00:59:36,043
I'll kill her first.

1422
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:38,145
How did he die?

1423
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:40,347
Okay,
first letâ€™s throw this body out

1424
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,315
otherwise we'll get stuck in this mess.

1425
00:59:41,381 --> 00:59:42,850
I will go take a look outside.

1426
00:59:42,883 --> 00:59:44,084
You keep a watch here.

1427
00:59:46,053 --> 00:59:47,921
Hey the press it like this write,

1428
00:59:47,955 --> 00:59:49,823
They showed it in the movie Shivaji.

1429
00:59:58,065 --> 01:00:00,234
Until my brother gets the
position of the minister,

1430
01:00:00,234 --> 01:00:01,134
Hey!

1431
01:00:01,134 --> 01:00:01,735
Get down...

1432
01:00:01,835 --> 01:00:03,670
See what I do to him.

1433
01:00:03,704 --> 01:00:05,572
I will show him what Chanakya fan is.

1434
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,208
Do you know who I am?

1435
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:10,377
MLA Chanakya fan.

1436
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:13,046
I'm MLA Chanakya's sweetheart.

1437
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,015
Hey, how was the birthday party?

1438
01:00:15,215 --> 01:00:16,049
Very good, brother.

1439
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:17,584
Hey, give him a t-shirt.

1440
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:21,688
Cut it into pieces and throw it out.
-Pieces!

1441
01:00:22,389 --> 01:00:24,458
I told you I will get the cake pieces!

1442
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:25,692
Shut your mouth.

1443
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,628
Hey, take it.

1444
01:00:27,661 --> 01:00:28,695
Take it.

1445
01:00:28,695 --> 01:00:30,130
MLA Chanakya...

1446
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:30,931
â€œAmar Raheâ€

1447
01:00:31,098 --> 01:00:32,165
â€œVardhilaliâ€

1448
01:00:32,332 --> 01:00:33,300
â€œVardhilaliâ€

1449
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,168
â€œAmar Raheâ€

1450
01:00:34,334 --> 01:00:35,135
It sounds very good.

1451
01:00:35,169 --> 01:00:36,470
Say â€œAmar Raheâ€

1452
01:00:36,537 --> 01:00:37,838
Say â€œAmar Raheâ€

1453
01:00:38,071 --> 01:00:38,872
â€œAmar Raheâ€

1454
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:41,308
MLA Chanakya...
â€œAmar Raheâ€

1455
01:00:41,441 --> 01:00:43,177
MLA Chanakya...
â€œAmar Raheâ€

1456
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:45,779
MLA Chanakya...
â€œAmar Raheâ€

1457
01:00:45,879 --> 01:00:47,614
MLA Chanakya...
â€œAmar Raheâ€

1458
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:50,284
Tomorrow morning, the whole city
should be filled with banners.

1459
01:00:50,284 --> 01:00:50,851
Okay?

1460
01:00:51,285 --> 01:00:52,252
â€œAmar Raheâ€

1461
01:00:54,087 --> 01:00:55,289
Hey, what happened?

1462
01:00:55,322 --> 01:00:57,090
Chankya's men are roaming outside.

1463
01:00:57,124 --> 01:01:00,093
Power has gone and
it is completely dark outside.

1464
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:00,794
This is the best time

1465
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:02,095
To take the body out
and put it in the vehicle

1466
01:01:02,129 --> 01:01:03,197
and throw it out somewhere.

1467
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:04,031
Then we don't have to worry.

1468
01:01:04,031 --> 01:01:05,265
Pick him up
-Let's go.

1469
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:06,567
Lift him up.

1470
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:07,734
We need to disappear
before the power is back on.

1471
01:01:07,768 --> 01:01:08,602
Lift him up from the middle.

1472
01:01:08,635 --> 01:01:09,903
Will it rise from the middle?

1473
01:01:09,903 --> 01:01:11,305
He is very heavy, mama.

1474
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:12,906
He put on weight eating the people's money.

1475
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:15,309
Lift him properly

1476
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:15,909
I am.

1477
01:01:15,943 --> 01:01:17,544
Why is all the weight on me?

1478
01:01:17,578 --> 01:01:19,079
I am carrying the whole body.
-Hold the body in the middle.

1479
01:01:19,146 --> 01:01:20,547
Should I carry the whole body or what?

1480
01:01:21,648 --> 01:01:23,250
My buzz is dead.

1481
01:01:23,283 --> 01:01:25,385
Please don't panic. Please,

1482
01:01:25,419 --> 01:01:27,888
Remember how they spoke of
our friendship in Jogipet.

1483
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:30,290
We need to be united
during times like these.

1484
01:01:32,326 --> 01:01:33,594
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

1485
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,802
Hey, boys are you there?

1486
01:01:44,505 --> 01:01:45,105
Psst.

1487
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:46,673
Hey come out you guys.

1488
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:47,975
Look, I'm coming out.

1489
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:48,575
coming.

1490
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,348
What about unity?

1491
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:55,616
You're the one who ran away first, scumbag.

1492
01:01:55,649 --> 01:01:57,584
I went to check on the power,

1493
01:01:57,618 --> 01:01:57,985
What about you?

1494
01:01:58,018 --> 01:01:59,086
I left because you left.

1495
01:01:59,186 --> 01:02:00,354
You always depend on me for everything.

1496
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:01,188
Cheap parasites.

1497
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:02,723
Come on lift the body.

1498
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:03,423
Pick him up.

1499
01:02:03,423 --> 01:02:04,124
Oh no!

1500
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:05,959
Put him aside.

1501
01:02:10,197 --> 01:02:13,267
I'll go take a look outside.
You keep watch here.

1502
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:14,134
Okay go.

1503
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:20,807
Once body is in the vehicle.
I will take care of it.

1504
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:21,942
Don't be afraid.

1505
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:22,709
Where is the vehicle?

1506
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:23,844
What did you eat?

1507
01:02:24,344 --> 01:02:25,779
Tomato.

1508
01:02:25,812 --> 01:02:27,648
Tomato yesterday, tomato today.

1509
01:02:27,648 --> 01:02:29,383
Do you like tomatoes?

1510
01:02:29,483 --> 01:02:31,685
Yeah, a lot.

1511
01:02:31,718 --> 01:02:33,654
What else do you like? Ridge gourd?

1512
01:02:33,787 --> 01:02:35,956
Yeah, I kind of like it.

1513
01:02:35,989 --> 01:02:37,558
What colour should I wear tomorrow?

1514
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:39,326
Hey, why are you romancing
next to that corpse?

1515
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,627
You idiot.

1516
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:42,062
-Hey, push the body-
-Pull, pull.

1517
01:02:42,162 --> 01:02:42,996
Bend the legs

1518
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,631
We'll fit the entire body in the boot.

1519
01:02:44,698 --> 01:02:46,200
How much should we push inside?

1520
01:02:46,233 --> 01:02:47,434
Hey, why did they
switch on the lights?

1521
01:02:50,704 --> 01:02:51,705
Oh god.

1522
01:02:53,473 --> 01:02:54,875
Sir, sir, we donâ€™t know sir.

1523
01:02:54,908 --> 01:02:57,511
Thatâ€™s why I told you we
should chop him into pieces.

1524
01:02:57,511 --> 01:02:58,679
But will you listen to me?

1525
01:02:59,746 --> 01:03:00,948
Sir, that-

1526
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:03,383
Hello.

1527
01:03:04,718 --> 01:03:05,619
Is everything good?

1528
01:03:06,086 --> 01:03:07,054
Sir.

1529
01:03:12,826 --> 01:03:14,795
He's in a critical condition.

1530
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:16,129
Is this an Emergency case.

1531
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:17,798
Take it before the press arrives.

1532
01:03:17,831 --> 01:03:18,432
Get on with it.

1533
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:19,800
Oh man, he is alive.

1534
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:20,567
Oh God

1535
01:03:20,601 --> 01:03:22,636
I asked you to check
whether was he alive properly,

1536
01:03:22,669 --> 01:03:23,470
What did you do?

1537
01:03:23,504 --> 01:03:24,304
I checked.

1538
01:03:24,438 --> 01:03:25,405
Die.

1539
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:27,674
I checked the right side?

1540
01:03:28,675 --> 01:03:29,209
Oh god.

1541
01:03:29,243 --> 01:03:30,911
Don't you know where the heart is?

1542
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:32,079
You didn't study maths?

1543
01:03:33,347 --> 01:03:34,147
It is all because of you.

1544
01:03:34,314 --> 01:03:37,651
If I'm the problem, I'll leave right away.

1545
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:39,186
Go and die.

1546
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:40,087
Where are you going?

1547
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:40,654
Go, get into the jeep.

1548
01:03:40,654 --> 01:03:41,822
Please listen to me once, sir.

1549
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:43,390
We really are innocent sir.

1550
01:03:43,423 --> 01:03:44,024
We don't know anything.

1551
01:03:44,024 --> 01:03:45,392
As soon as the MLA's body
was dropped in our room

1552
01:03:45,425 --> 01:03:47,294
We wanted to take him to the hospital.

1553
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:48,829
We wanted to help him sir.

1554
01:03:48,862 --> 01:03:50,297
He is alive,
thatâ€™s what we wanted sir.

1555
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:51,265
Really?
Indeed sir.

1556
01:03:51,298 --> 01:03:51,765
Hey...

1557
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:07,548
What are you looking at sir?

1558
01:04:09,683 --> 01:04:11,385
Sir, this was a 500 rupee-

1559
01:04:11,385 --> 01:04:12,386
It was a fake prison sir.

1560
01:04:12,419 --> 01:04:13,120
What are these?

1561
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:16,590
what are these SIM cards?

1562
01:04:16,857 --> 01:04:18,091
Are you terrorists?

1563
01:04:18,091 --> 01:04:19,226
Hey Inspector!

1564
01:04:19,226 --> 01:04:20,360
Itâ€™s a love failure case...

1565
01:04:20,394 --> 01:04:21,228
Yes. Thatâ€™s right sir.

1566
01:04:21,261 --> 01:04:22,796
The shop owner gave 10 sim cards
when we bought one.

1567
01:04:22,829 --> 01:04:23,530
You can take one sir.

1568
01:04:28,769 --> 01:04:30,470
They came for Aadhar card verification.

1569
01:04:30,804 --> 01:04:31,471
you go upstairs.

1570
01:04:32,206 --> 01:04:32,606
Sir, sir.

1571
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:35,375
Sir, please donâ€™t create a scene here.

1572
01:04:35,409 --> 01:04:37,211
If you want, tell me the location,
I will book a 'Yuber' and come there.

1573
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:39,046
Hey, move
you dimwits, move.

1574
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,914
Verification has become very strict

1575
01:04:40,914 --> 01:04:42,416
Hey Chitti, you go upstairs.
I will call you.

1576
01:04:42,616 --> 01:04:43,784
Hey, move.

1577
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:44,952
This is Raviâ€™s place, sir.

1578
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,754
Hey, where are you going?

1579
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,991
I will bring my charger, sir.

1580
01:04:51,825 --> 01:04:53,493
Sir, please listen to me.

1581
01:04:54,995 --> 01:04:56,730
Arey, please listen to me.

1582
01:04:57,764 --> 01:04:58,765
Sir,

1583
01:05:01,368 --> 01:05:02,369
Sir,

1584
01:05:03,504 --> 01:05:04,404
Namas-

1585
01:05:04,438 --> 01:05:05,439
I am very innocent, sir.

1586
01:05:08,408 --> 01:05:09,443
I donâ€™t know anything...

1587
01:05:14,181 --> 01:05:15,716
Your lie should at least be believable.

1588
01:05:16,683 --> 01:05:17,784
You have to tell....

1589
01:05:17,784 --> 01:05:19,086
You have to tell me.

1590
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,955
We're trying to meet each other,
but we are not meeting.

1591
01:05:21,989 --> 01:05:22,689
-Yeah

1592
01:05:22,689 --> 01:05:23,524
Actually,

1593
01:05:23,757 --> 01:05:25,759
I've come out of station fr some work.

1594
01:05:25,792 --> 01:05:27,194
Police Station?
-huh?

1595
01:05:27,361 --> 01:05:29,863
When I said out of station
you heard police station?

1596
01:05:29,863 --> 01:05:32,199
Hey, my mother is coming,
I will call you later.

1597
01:05:32,232 --> 01:05:32,766
Really?

1598
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:33,700
Okay,

1599
01:05:33,967 --> 01:05:34,468
You cut the call.

1600
01:05:34,501 --> 01:05:35,068
No, you cut the call.

1601
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:36,837
I won't cut the call, you do it.

1602
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:37,738
Hey, cut the call.

1603
01:05:40,073 --> 01:05:42,009
Do you know how big a case we're stuck in?

1604
01:05:43,076 --> 01:05:44,945
No one will ever know even
if they kill us in the lockup.

1605
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:47,481
What will they do to us?

1606
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:52,452
Sir how many years
would we be imprisoned for this case?

1607
01:05:52,486 --> 01:05:53,453
14 years!!

1608
01:05:56,456 --> 01:05:59,726
But because we're good people,
they'll look at our decent behaviour and..

1609
01:05:59,826 --> 01:06:01,395
Can they reduce it by 10-12 years?

1610
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:03,397
They won't? Okay.

1611
01:06:04,164 --> 01:06:06,099
Chitti will get married
during those 14 years

1612
01:06:11,371 --> 01:06:14,074
Hey boys, someone named
Chitti is here for you

1613
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:16,877
It's true love.

1614
01:06:20,881 --> 01:06:23,050
Chitti,I now know what love is,

1615
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,786
and the value of love.

1616
01:06:28,922 --> 01:06:30,958
Even when all these people suspect me,

1617
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:32,893
You trusted me and came here,

1618
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:33,994
That's enough.

1619
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:35,362
Thatâ€™s enough for me.

1620
01:06:35,395 --> 01:06:36,463
Why are you looking at me like that?

1621
01:06:38,432 --> 01:06:39,800
Do you also suspect me?

1622
01:06:40,033 --> 01:06:41,935
You've been lying to me from the beginning.

1623
01:06:41,935 --> 01:06:42,769
What did I say?

1624
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,072
You said, your father was in the military,

1625
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:46,707
Chi...

1626
01:06:47,474 --> 01:06:48,342
That's a sma-

1627
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:50,143
You suspect me of a murder
for such a small thing?

1628
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,144
Are you insane?

1629
01:06:53,413 --> 01:06:54,147
What is your father saying?

1630
01:06:54,781 --> 01:06:56,016
He said good riddance.

1631
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:56,917
Huh.

1632
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:58,685
You didn't tell your father,

1633
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:00,621
that I'm a good person
who tells small lies?

1634
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:02,356
If he lies about the small things,

1635
01:07:02,389 --> 01:07:04,057
what would he do about the bigger things?

1636
01:07:04,091 --> 01:07:05,225
Is it your father saying all this?

1637
01:07:05,225 --> 01:07:05,726
Yes.

1638
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:06,860
Uh-huh.

1639
01:07:08,428 --> 01:07:09,663
What do you think about me then?

1640
01:07:11,798 --> 01:07:13,767
There's no love here Sujatha.

1641
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:14,768
Chitti....

1642
01:07:14,902 --> 01:07:15,202
Pinky!

1643
01:07:15,435 --> 01:07:16,203
Srikanth?
-Sujatha?

1644
01:07:16,236 --> 01:07:16,937
Hey, listen....

1645
01:07:16,937 --> 01:07:19,606
Just get hell and heaven out of from me.

1646
01:07:19,907 --> 01:07:20,307
Just...

1647
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:22,309
Go to hell-en.

1648
01:07:25,579 --> 01:07:27,147
Don't let the door
hit you on your way out.

1649
01:07:27,181 --> 01:07:29,449
"I am the king of the thiefâ€™s street...."

1650
01:07:30,384 --> 01:07:31,919
Move aside, uncle...

1651
01:07:31,919 --> 01:07:35,389
"Standing like a post,
is it a lady or cell tower?"

1652
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:39,893
Passion of the Christ.

1653
01:07:47,601 --> 01:07:48,435
How old is this?

1654
01:07:56,443 --> 01:07:57,845
You won't update yourself
when I ask you to.

1655
01:07:58,178 --> 01:07:59,713
Please don't keep visiting.

1656
01:07:59,746 --> 01:08:01,014
I felt a little homesick, sir.

1657
01:08:01,882 --> 01:08:02,916
The situation is not great outside.

1658
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,084
Some viral fever,

1659
01:08:04,418 --> 01:08:06,220
Fever and body pains,

1660
01:08:06,653 --> 01:08:07,921
Who will take care of me
if something happens to me?

1661
01:08:08,155 --> 01:08:09,223
If I stay here,

1662
01:08:09,256 --> 01:08:10,824
you will take care of me,

1663
01:08:10,824 --> 01:08:12,059
slight trust, safety.

1664
01:08:13,594 --> 01:08:14,494
Don't I have it?

1665
01:08:15,729 --> 01:08:16,663
Hey Chinna...

1666
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:17,698
fresh?

1667
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:20,400
You look like a juicy ice apple.

1668
01:08:20,434 --> 01:08:21,401
What did you do?

1669
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:22,569
Wait let me guess.

1670
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:24,371
As far as I know,

1671
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:26,607
You got down a running bus

1672
01:08:26,607 --> 01:08:27,641
and the police caught you.

1673
01:08:28,575 --> 01:08:29,610
Donâ€™t be embarrassed.

1674
01:08:29,643 --> 01:08:31,044
I came from the same situation.

1675
01:08:31,078 --> 01:08:32,546
You won't believe me.

1676
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:35,883
When I myself complained to the police
that I lost my drugs,

1677
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:38,986
They beat the hell out of me
in a 6 X 6 room.

1678
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,255
My career began then.

1679
01:08:41,722 --> 01:08:42,356
I have seen the peaks.

1680
01:08:43,724 --> 01:08:45,325
From the information
coming to us,

1681
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,594
MLA Chanakya sirâ€™s
condition is critical.

1682
01:08:48,562 --> 01:08:49,463
Oh, is his condition that serious?

1683
01:08:50,063 --> 01:08:51,064
He won't even laugh at a joke?

1684
01:08:51,098 --> 01:08:52,733
How is MLA Chanakya sir?

1685
01:08:52,866 --> 01:08:54,935
His condition is very critical...
We canâ€™t say anything now.

1686
01:08:55,235 --> 01:08:56,470
Have to tell us now.

1687
01:08:56,503 --> 01:08:57,504
Fans

1688
01:08:58,272 --> 01:09:00,307
Donâ€™t play games inside the four walls.

1689
01:09:00,507 --> 01:09:02,042
If you have the guts,
bring our leader out

1690
01:09:02,042 --> 01:09:03,544
before everybody and
do a postmortem.

1691
01:09:04,044 --> 01:09:05,512
I will see, how he won't live.

1692
01:09:06,413 --> 01:09:07,381
Breaking News.

1693
01:09:08,382 --> 01:09:11,084
MLA Chanakya has
just regained consciousness

1694
01:09:12,052 --> 01:09:13,420
For all the well wishers-

1695
01:09:15,522 --> 01:09:16,256
Greetings.

1696
01:09:17,057 --> 01:09:17,791
He survived

1697
01:09:18,392 --> 01:09:20,928
Because I still have to do
service to the people,

1698
01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:24,531
God has saved me.

1699
01:09:24,865 --> 01:09:28,535
If you ask them to speak,
they'll give long speeches.

1700
01:09:29,069 --> 01:09:31,905
Today before the media,
I'm going to name all

1701
01:09:31,939 --> 01:09:34,875
the people who've
attempted to murder me.

1702
01:09:35,442 --> 01:09:37,177
Big names will come out rolling,
you just watch.

1703
01:09:37,578 --> 01:09:38,545
Srikanth!

1704
01:09:39,346 --> 01:09:40,214
Srikanth means you no?

1705
01:09:40,247 --> 01:09:41,081
Ravi

1706
01:09:41,882 --> 01:09:42,616
And Shekhar.

1707
01:09:47,888 --> 01:09:50,791
These three people who've
recently moved into our apartment,

1708
01:09:51,158 --> 01:09:53,293
attempted to murder me.

1709
01:09:54,394 --> 01:09:56,096
Oh my.

1710
01:09:59,233 --> 01:10:00,534
Grand debut, man.

1711
01:10:11,545 --> 01:10:15,516
Notice: To exhibit
real incidents,

1712
01:10:15,549 --> 01:10:18,685
some events are filmed
using actors and actresses.

1713
01:10:19,086 --> 01:10:20,654
Jogipet Srikanth

1714
01:10:21,321 --> 01:10:22,089
Me?

1715
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,491
Jogipet Ravi

1716
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,095
Jogipet Sekhar

1717
01:10:29,863 --> 01:10:31,198
Is that supposed to be me?

1718
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:33,367
To be frank, he looks better than you, Mama

1719
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,336
Pickpocketing in Sanga Reddy,

1720
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:39,439
Their criminal life began
with the drug mafia.

1721
01:10:39,573 --> 01:10:40,307
Who are these people?

1722
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,943
They'll go through any lengths
for small pleasure.

1723
01:10:42,976 --> 01:10:44,545
Bro, give me thirty rupees
worth of chicken.

1724
01:10:44,545 --> 01:10:45,179
30 Rupees,Anna?

1725
01:10:45,212 --> 01:10:45,846
Yep.

1726
01:10:48,115 --> 01:10:49,016
Give me the liver

1727
01:10:49,016 --> 01:10:50,784
You won't even get this
plastic bag for thirty rupees,

1728
01:10:50,817 --> 01:10:51,552
how will you get liver?

1729
01:10:51,585 --> 01:10:52,553
Then give me neck pieces.

1730
01:10:52,586 --> 01:10:53,654
Hey you wonâ€™t get
anything for thirty rupees.

1731
01:10:53,654 --> 01:10:55,055
Why not!

1732
01:10:56,723 --> 01:10:58,258
Jogipet Shekhar....

1733
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:01,195
Tired of the petty crimes,

1734
01:11:01,195 --> 01:11:04,131
and with a plan to make it big,

1735
01:11:04,131 --> 01:11:05,566
They shifted to Hyderabad.

1736
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:07,568
As soon as they reached Hyderabad,

1737
01:11:07,568 --> 01:11:08,936
they raised hell.

1738
01:11:09,536 --> 01:11:11,839
We don't know what
they've planned,

1739
01:11:11,872 --> 01:11:14,842
but entered a posh apartment.

1740
01:11:15,342 --> 01:11:16,343
Umm...

1741
01:11:18,245 --> 01:11:20,647
They gate crashed MLA Chanakya's party

1742
01:11:20,681 --> 01:11:22,616
And while they were trying to steal money,

1743
01:11:22,649 --> 01:11:23,984
they shot MLA Chanakya,

1744
01:11:24,017 --> 01:11:25,886
who was trying to stop them.

1745
01:11:29,122 --> 01:11:31,525
Happy Birthday my boy

1746
01:11:35,028 --> 01:11:36,530
Jogipet Shekhar.

1747
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:39,533
But who are these people really?

1748
01:11:39,533 --> 01:11:41,735
Let's talk to people who know them well.

1749
01:11:41,768 --> 01:11:43,637
They would hit the pigeons
perched on the electrical wires

1750
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:45,572
with beer bottles

1751
01:11:45,606 --> 01:11:46,607
I knew it the moment they arrived here sir,

1752
01:11:46,673 --> 01:11:47,774
that they belong here.

1753
01:11:47,774 --> 01:11:49,142
Death is fun for them, sir.

1754
01:11:49,743 --> 01:11:51,945
I haven't been able to sleep since then.

1755
01:11:52,412 --> 01:11:54,515
I'm still taking sleeping tablets sir.

1756
01:11:55,382 --> 01:11:57,384
Ravi, your mother is here.

1757
01:11:58,585 --> 01:12:00,554
We really didn't do anything.

1758
01:12:00,587 --> 01:12:01,822
What is all this?

1759
01:12:01,822 --> 01:12:03,490
At least tell now,

1760
01:12:03,524 --> 01:12:05,225
why did you want to kill the MLA?

1761
01:12:05,259 --> 01:12:06,927
Huh? Why would we kill him?

1762
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,595
Lies everything is a lie,

1763
01:12:08,629 --> 01:12:09,796
you said you'd go for a movie,

1764
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:11,665
and eloped with the sarpanch's daughter.

1765
01:12:11,698 --> 01:12:12,699
Aunty, please not here.

1766
01:12:12,699 --> 01:12:14,268
You said you's hunt wild boar,

1767
01:12:14,268 --> 01:12:15,536
took those guns,

1768
01:12:15,536 --> 01:12:17,004
and what did you?

1769
01:12:17,004 --> 01:12:19,706
Last year, you said you were
going to Tirupathi.

1770
01:12:19,706 --> 01:12:22,910
But you went to Goa, got sloshed and
got caught by the police.

1771
01:12:22,943 --> 01:12:24,011
Get out.

1772
01:12:24,011 --> 01:12:24,978
Leave immediately.

1773
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:27,047
Okay, I'll leave,

1774
01:12:27,047 --> 01:12:29,483
If you think I'm the one
causing the problem,

1775
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:30,517
I'll leave from here.

1776
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:38,692
Is your entire family like this?

1777
01:12:44,331 --> 01:12:45,465
Whatâ€™s your name?

1778
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:46,266
Sir,

1779
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:47,234
Whatâ€™s your name?

1780
01:12:47,234 --> 01:12:48,802
As in like an attendance register,

1781
01:12:48,836 --> 01:12:49,803
or what they call me otherwise?

1782
01:12:49,837 --> 01:12:50,804
How many names do you have?

1783
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:52,139
Srikanth.

1784
01:12:52,406 --> 01:12:53,307
What is your name?

1785
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,508
Pasupuleti Shekhar.

1786
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:55,375
What is your name?

1787
01:12:56,376 --> 01:12:57,711
Hey your name?

1788
01:12:57,744 --> 01:12:58,445
Ravi.

1789
01:12:59,446 --> 01:13:01,481
Why did you go to the party uninvited?

1790
01:13:01,515 --> 01:13:03,483
We thought maybe he forgot to invite us.

1791
01:13:03,517 --> 01:13:04,184
What?

1792
01:13:04,184 --> 01:13:06,153
We thought maybe he forgot to invite us.

1793
01:13:06,186 --> 01:13:06,987
Is that how one goes to a party?

1794
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:07,721
I think so.

1795
01:13:08,288 --> 01:13:09,189
Then why did you go?

1796
01:13:09,489 --> 01:13:11,024
I went to eat Murgh Masallum, sir.

1797
01:13:11,225 --> 01:13:12,593
What did you think of doing with body?

1798
01:13:12,993 --> 01:13:13,861
We thought of burying it.

1799
01:13:13,894 --> 01:13:14,928
Hey, shut up.

1800
01:13:14,962 --> 01:13:15,696
I am talking no?

1801
01:13:15,729 --> 01:13:16,530
Listen-

1802
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:18,365
He is a fool, sir,
He doesnâ€™t know anything, sir.

1803
01:13:18,365 --> 01:13:19,266
We weren't going to bury it sir,

1804
01:13:19,266 --> 01:13:20,834
I swear, please believe me.

1805
01:13:20,868 --> 01:13:22,169
We thought we'd stuff
the corpse in the boot

1806
01:13:22,202 --> 01:13:23,036
and throw it in the lake.

1807
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:25,506
Hey, shame on you.
Why do you lie so much?

1808
01:13:25,539 --> 01:13:26,773
Sir, I swear.

1809
01:13:26,773 --> 01:13:28,675
We thought of cutting
the body into pieces

1810
01:13:28,709 --> 01:13:29,910
and parceling it.

1811
01:13:29,943 --> 01:13:31,411
Hey you dimwit,

1812
01:13:31,445 --> 01:13:33,413
when did we agree upon that?

1813
01:13:33,447 --> 01:13:34,214
Hey, why are you pouncing on me?

1814
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:35,048
Hey...

1815
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:38,352
But the three of you agreed

1816
01:13:38,385 --> 01:13:39,686
upon getting rid of the body?

1817
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:40,187
Yes, sir.

1818
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:40,687
Correct...

1819
01:13:40,721 --> 01:13:41,154
exactly

1820
01:13:41,188 --> 01:13:42,589
Wow, sir is super intelligent.

1821
01:13:43,891 --> 01:13:45,325
So you've done something like this before?

1822
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:46,660
No sir, this is our first time.

1823
01:13:47,027 --> 01:13:47,794
First time?

1824
01:13:48,028 --> 01:13:48,996
Ah...

1825
01:13:48,996 --> 01:13:50,831
It isnâ€™t that first time...

1826
01:13:51,965 --> 01:13:54,134
First time...one...
water...feeling thirsty, sir

1827
01:13:54,368 --> 01:13:55,569
I will go back to Jogipet sir.

1828
01:13:56,637 --> 01:13:57,404
We really are-

1829
01:13:57,404 --> 01:13:59,473
You remind me of my father sir,

1830
01:14:00,007 --> 01:14:01,275
He's just like you.

1831
01:14:01,341 --> 01:14:02,509
The water's not good, let it be.

1832
01:14:02,576 --> 01:14:03,844
Hey,leave it there.

1833
01:14:04,077 --> 01:14:04,878
My head-

1834
01:14:04,912 --> 01:14:05,979
Replace the cap.

1835
01:14:07,881 --> 01:14:10,884
Hey, you're claiming to be innocent right?

1836
01:14:10,884 --> 01:14:12,386
You're entire history is in this.

1837
01:14:13,387 --> 01:14:14,388
Do you get it?

1838
01:14:14,488 --> 01:14:15,756
Hey

1839
01:14:16,423 --> 01:14:17,891
Is this a joke to you?

1840
01:14:18,725 --> 01:14:19,560
What are you doing here man?

1841
01:14:19,593 --> 01:14:20,861
Who are you threatening over the phone?

1842
01:14:20,894 --> 01:14:22,563
Who are you blackmailing?

1843
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:24,264
Ah...ah...that was,

1844
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:25,666
I said I would cook rice

1845
01:14:25,699 --> 01:14:26,733
and asked him whether he
would get the curries sir,

1846
01:14:30,003 --> 01:14:32,606
Okay, You are innocent.

1847
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:34,474
Why didnâ€™t you inform the police?

1848
01:14:34,508 --> 01:14:36,844
I mean if we tell the police,
they'd make a mess out of it no sir?

1849
01:14:37,044 --> 01:14:38,045
That's why we decided against it.

1850
01:14:41,114 --> 01:14:43,383
I will now show you
my type of interrogation!

1851
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:44,451
Oh my.

1852
01:14:44,451 --> 01:14:45,419
Do you understand?

1853
01:14:45,452 --> 01:14:47,187
Understood sir.

1854
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:48,388
Where is the toilet, sir?

1855
01:14:51,291 --> 01:14:53,460
I have loaded 0.5 mg.

1856
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,362
You can start your
interrogation within 2 minutes.

1857
01:14:56,263 --> 01:14:57,898
What actually happened on the birthday?

1858
01:14:57,931 --> 01:14:58,699
Birthday?

1859
01:14:59,032 --> 01:15:00,634
Do you hold any small grudges?

1860
01:15:01,235 --> 01:15:02,970
Why not sir?

1861
01:15:03,237 --> 01:15:05,672
Sir, to be frank I'm not getting high
with the medicine.

1862
01:15:05,973 --> 01:15:07,908
Thatâ€™s a very strong dose, sir.

1863
01:15:07,941 --> 01:15:09,243
If we give more,
he may go into coma.

1864
01:15:09,243 --> 01:15:11,144
Do you know how experienced I am, with alcohol?

1865
01:15:11,144 --> 01:15:13,981
Right from the local Jogipet liquor
to foreign scotches.

1866
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,649
Where is your den?

1867
01:15:15,716 --> 01:15:17,084
Where do you meet each other?

1868
01:15:17,651 --> 01:15:19,319
Srikanth Ladies Emporium...

1869
01:15:22,556 --> 01:15:23,957
None of these will work sir.

1870
01:15:26,093 --> 01:15:28,161
We stitch pico and falls here.

1871
01:15:28,195 --> 01:15:31,398
Matching bangles for
pattu langas also 'alaivable'

1872
01:15:31,965 --> 01:15:33,400
I will kill that guy.

1873
01:15:33,433 --> 01:15:34,134
Whom?

1874
01:15:34,468 --> 01:15:36,904
The character who acted in the TV serial
â€œNeralu â€“ Ghoraluâ€

1875
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:43,177
No man, do you have
any resentments against anybody?

1876
01:15:43,577 --> 01:15:44,711
Vanajakshi.

1877
01:15:44,945 --> 01:15:46,813
Sir, actually,
we are from Jogipet.

1878
01:15:46,813 --> 01:15:48,815
We thought of taking
a room in Hyderabad.

1879
01:15:48,815 --> 01:15:50,684
I will kill that person.

1880
01:15:50,717 --> 01:15:52,753
She used me to match all her
accessories for her wedding,

1881
01:15:52,753 --> 01:15:54,354
Anklets, bangles, clothes...

1882
01:15:54,354 --> 01:15:55,889
Under the pretext of
those top stars,

1883
01:15:55,923 --> 01:15:57,424
he took us to Royal Villas.

1884
01:15:57,558 --> 01:15:59,793
But on her wedding day,
nothing she ware was matching,

1885
01:15:59,826 --> 01:16:01,528
She soiled my reputation sir.

1886
01:16:01,562 --> 01:16:04,631
They kicked us out because
I hit the owner's son.

1887
01:16:04,665 --> 01:16:05,899
I hate you, Vanajakshi.

1888
01:16:06,366 --> 01:16:07,734
The world has gone to the dogs, baldy.

1889
01:16:07,734 --> 01:16:08,769
Vanajakshi

1890
01:16:09,002 --> 01:16:10,204
I hate her sir.

1891
01:16:10,938 --> 01:16:13,273
Didnâ€™t you say you'd kill him,
in front of everybody when you were drunk?

1892
01:16:14,474 --> 01:16:15,342
He said it sir.

1893
01:16:15,742 --> 01:16:16,777
Hey said it only once.

1894
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:18,712
Why did you want to kill me?

1895
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,948
Tell me or I'll kill you.

1896
01:16:20,948 --> 01:16:22,716
You didn't feed me cake.

1897
01:16:23,784 --> 01:16:25,485
We cut a cake on your birthday

1898
01:16:25,485 --> 01:16:26,687
You feed the guy next to you.

1899
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,021
Not just once.

1900
01:16:28,322 --> 01:16:29,656
On multiple occasions.

1901
01:16:35,562 --> 01:16:36,697
That's why,

1902
01:16:36,797 --> 01:16:38,365
I got so angry that I wanted to shoot you.

1903
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:40,067
But I didn't shot you.

1904
01:16:40,267 --> 01:16:41,034
Hey

1905
01:16:41,034 --> 01:16:43,237
What man?
-after everything you did.

1906
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:44,638
did everything you could...

1907
01:16:45,038 --> 01:16:46,039
Stop it.

1908
01:16:46,039 --> 01:16:46,907
Leave.

1909
01:16:46,907 --> 01:16:47,875
Brother, it was really the cake-

1910
01:16:47,908 --> 01:16:48,742
Leave!

1911
01:16:56,817 --> 01:16:59,553
The number you've called is switched off.

1912
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:13,467
What happened sir?

1913
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,135
Why do you look so worried?

1914
01:17:15,169 --> 01:17:16,403
Do you know who the judge is?

1915
01:17:16,436 --> 01:17:17,838
Justice Balwant Chaudhary.

1916
01:17:35,122 --> 01:17:36,290
Your Honor,

1917
01:17:36,323 --> 01:17:38,225
This is basically an open and shut case.

1918
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:39,560
These three,

1919
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:41,161
Were caught red handed

1920
01:17:41,195 --> 01:17:43,297
trying to stash MLA Chanakya's
dead body in the car.

1921
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:45,933
I will ask them a few questions
for the sake of formality.

1922
01:17:48,869 --> 01:17:49,870
Stand properly.

1923
01:17:50,237 --> 01:17:51,839
Why did you come to Hyderabad?

1924
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:52,773
To settle-

1925
01:17:52,806 --> 01:17:54,741
For settlements and
other illegal activities sir.

1926
01:17:54,908 --> 01:17:56,176
Hey, no sir.
-N..Noo sir.

1927
01:17:57,778 --> 01:18:01,548
Generally the youth parties in a pub or a restaurant,

1928
01:18:01,815 --> 01:18:03,684
Then why did you go to the jail?

1929
01:18:04,151 --> 01:18:04,818
For fun

1930
01:18:04,885 --> 01:18:07,821
Fun? For them
going to jail is fun, your honor.

1931
01:18:07,888 --> 01:18:08,856
Oh! No, no sir.
-No, sir.

1932
01:18:09,423 --> 01:18:12,025
What was your exact reaction
when you saw the body?

1933
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:13,894
What else sir, we thought we'd bury him

1934
01:18:14,962 --> 01:18:15,963
Oh,

1935
01:18:16,964 --> 01:18:19,633
Do you feel like you've done something wrong?

1936
01:18:19,666 --> 01:18:20,634
Why will it be there, sir?

1937
01:18:20,934 --> 01:18:21,635
Oho!

1938
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:24,838
Are you at least feeling any remorse?

1939
01:18:24,872 --> 01:18:26,373
No sir, nothing at all.

1940
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:27,541
Oh.

1941
01:18:29,676 --> 01:18:31,678
Even after all this,

1942
01:18:31,712 --> 01:18:34,414
And without a morsel of guilt,

1943
01:18:34,414 --> 01:18:37,050
They're worse than the hard-core criminals.

1944
01:18:37,084 --> 01:18:38,919
Without any mercy shown on them,

1945
01:18:38,919 --> 01:18:41,455
we hope the court punishes them severely.

1946
01:18:41,755 --> 01:18:42,589
Sir... sir... sir....

1947
01:18:42,789 --> 01:18:45,425
Do you have a lawyer to defend you?

1948
01:18:46,927 --> 01:18:49,897
We will defend our case ourselves,
your honor.

1949
01:18:49,963 --> 01:18:51,665
Why don't you pass the
judgment also yourself,

1950
01:18:51,665 --> 01:18:53,200
Why are we even here, let's leave, come.

1951
01:18:53,233 --> 01:18:54,701
Sir, sorry sir.

1952
01:18:54,701 --> 01:18:56,503
It just come out in a flow.

1953
01:18:57,237 --> 01:18:59,540
Sir, there's a new lawyer here
to speak on behalf of them

1954
01:18:59,806 --> 01:19:01,508
Oho.

1955
01:19:28,902 --> 01:19:30,838
I have zero
knowledge on the subject.

1956
01:19:30,871 --> 01:19:31,905
Huh?

1957
01:19:31,905 --> 01:19:34,107
Somehow I manage to pass by cheating.

1958
01:19:34,141 --> 01:19:35,142
Really?

1959
01:19:37,811 --> 01:19:39,012
We'll defend our own case sir

1960
01:19:39,046 --> 01:19:41,215
We beg you, sir, please.

1961
01:19:41,248 --> 01:19:42,249
Chitti

1962
01:19:48,355 --> 01:19:49,590
Give it to them sir,

1963
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:50,591
Give them bail.

1964
01:19:50,624 --> 01:19:52,125
He give them a bail,

1965
01:19:52,426 --> 01:19:54,661
Give it, the lawyer madam is asking for it.

1966
01:19:54,695 --> 01:19:55,863
You are a lawyer, right?

1967
01:19:55,929 --> 01:19:57,331
That's why you need to
say something or the other.

1968
01:19:59,733 --> 01:20:02,302
Sir, No the law is nobody's family

1969
01:20:02,903 --> 01:20:03,737
Ah, so what?

1970
01:20:03,737 --> 01:20:08,275
So...

1971
01:20:08,342 --> 01:20:11,545
So between the struggle
between the law and justice...

1972
01:20:11,578 --> 01:20:13,413
Talk about the case please

1973
01:20:14,648 --> 01:20:16,583
No Chitti, please
I beg you please.

1974
01:20:16,717 --> 01:20:23,423
A 100 criminals may escape
but one innocent man-

1975
01:20:23,457 --> 01:20:24,625
Really?

1976
01:20:25,392 --> 01:20:26,393
Aha,

1977
01:20:27,794 --> 01:20:29,596
Come to the bench.

1978
01:20:34,434 --> 01:20:36,003
Which college?

1979
01:20:36,103 --> 01:20:38,472
College...

1980
01:20:39,273 --> 01:20:40,641
Fake certificate.

1981
01:20:45,145 --> 01:20:47,047
Have you read-

1982
01:20:47,181 --> 01:20:48,182
a book-

1983
01:20:48,448 --> 01:20:50,450
or at least a page about law?

1984
01:20:50,517 --> 01:20:52,085
I watched the movie Lawyer Suhasini twice.

1985
01:20:52,119 --> 01:20:52,853
Aha

1986
01:20:53,287 --> 01:20:54,054
Hah....

1987
01:20:55,622 --> 01:20:56,924
This is my last case.

1988
01:20:56,957 --> 01:20:59,059
Oh! this is my first case, sir.

1989
01:20:59,092 --> 01:20:59,426
Oh!

1990
01:20:59,459 --> 01:21:00,894
It is evident....

1991
01:21:02,129 --> 01:21:05,365
Along with movie dialogues,

1992
01:21:06,066 --> 01:21:08,602
Please mention a few Section numbers.

1993
01:21:09,603 --> 01:21:11,271
Otherwise it'll fall onto me.

1994
01:21:11,305 --> 01:21:12,172
Okay sir...

1995
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:15,542
Donâ€™t say anything more.

1996
01:21:18,178 --> 01:21:21,882
Sir, it is true that they went
to the party on that day.

1997
01:21:22,216 --> 01:21:23,984
Aah,tell him Chitti, you're in a good flow.

1998
01:21:24,017 --> 01:21:26,920
It is also true that they went to
eat â€œMurgh Musallamâ€

1999
01:21:26,954 --> 01:21:28,021
Correct, correct tell them.

2000
01:21:28,055 --> 01:21:30,657
Indeed, it is true that MLA's body
was found in their room.

2001
01:21:30,657 --> 01:21:31,625
Aah...

2002
01:21:31,658 --> 01:21:34,094
Lastly, the fact that they
wanted to kill the MLA is also-

2003
01:21:34,127 --> 01:21:36,396
Hey Chitti.
-What? What are you saying?

2004
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:37,931
I mean sir,

2005
01:21:38,465 --> 01:21:42,336
If they really had come here from Jogipet,

2006
01:21:42,803 --> 01:21:46,173
and had they thought of a
perfect plan to murder the MLA.

2007
01:21:47,107 --> 01:21:47,841
If they thought of it...

2008
01:21:48,041 --> 01:21:50,010
If they thought of it...
-if we thought of it?

2009
01:21:50,777 --> 01:21:51,745
If they thought of it.

2010
01:21:51,778 --> 01:21:52,546
Finish the sentence, Chitti

2011
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:54,548
Sir, she has more to say.

2012
01:21:54,548 --> 01:21:55,215
She's not done yet,

2013
01:21:55,249 --> 01:21:56,617
By 'if they thought of it' is

2014
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:58,318
something lawyers open with sir.

2015
01:21:58,352 --> 01:22:00,521
If we had thought of
it doesnâ€™t mean we actually did it.

2016
01:22:00,554 --> 01:22:05,592
According to section 113H and 10Y,
give them, please grant them sir,

2017
01:22:05,859 --> 01:22:08,595
Grant those poor things bail.

2018
01:22:10,464 --> 01:22:12,966
After listening to the arguments,

2019
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,235
I feel like I've heard nothing,

2020
01:22:15,269 --> 01:22:16,837
I'm adjourning the case.
-Sir.

2021
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:18,405
Instead of quoting sections numbers,

2022
01:22:18,438 --> 01:22:20,307
and by quoting numbers from the city buses,

2023
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,642
I warn Lawyer Shamili,

2024
01:22:21,675 --> 01:22:24,278
for side-tracking the court.

2025
01:22:25,712 --> 01:22:30,450
Her words have only increased the suspicion
on these three men.

2026
01:22:30,484 --> 01:22:31,685
Sir, sir, sir.

2027
01:22:31,718 --> 01:22:34,688
The court orders that
the culprits be shifted

2028
01:22:34,721 --> 01:22:36,924
from their current jail
to Chanchal Guda Jail.

2029
01:22:36,957 --> 01:22:38,258
Sir, we havenâ€™t done anything, sir.

2030
01:22:38,292 --> 01:22:39,326
Please donâ€™t shift to us to
Chanchal Guda jail, sir.

2031
01:22:39,426 --> 01:22:40,160
Please sir, please sir.

2032
01:22:40,194 --> 01:22:41,428
The current jail we're in is fine sir.

2033
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:42,296
Move,

2034
01:22:42,329 --> 01:22:43,864
Please listen to me, sir.

2035
01:22:43,897 --> 01:22:45,599
Sir, that girl is a devil, sir...

2036
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:46,667
Donâ€™t shift us to Chanchal Guda jail sir.

2037
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:48,702
Sir, she's not even a lawyer sir.

2038
01:22:48,735 --> 01:22:51,071
Susheela, are you happy
that you've trapped us?

2039
01:22:51,104 --> 01:22:53,040
Donâ€™t shift to us Chanchal Guda jail, sir.

2040
01:22:56,476 --> 01:23:00,614
They're trapped like parrots
in Chanchalguda Jail

2041
01:23:00,681 --> 01:23:03,884
They've become numbers on a slate now

2042
01:23:03,884 --> 01:23:07,754
They flew towards the
sky aiming for stars

2043
01:23:07,754 --> 01:23:12,326
fate kicked them in the butt
They fell right in to the hole

2044
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:19,933
They now understand all those sad songs.

2045
01:23:19,967 --> 01:23:21,435
They used to eat butter

2046
01:23:21,435 --> 01:23:25,506
Now they're eating dirt.

2047
01:23:25,506 --> 01:23:27,708
God knows what's gonna happen now

2048
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:31,879
Such colour dreams were dreamt that,

2049
01:23:31,945 --> 01:23:37,317
The heart has found some unknown hope

2050
01:23:54,134 --> 01:23:56,904
How carefree the fish was
in the cool water,

2051
01:23:56,904 --> 01:24:01,475
But now it's being scaled
to be cooked in fire.

2052
01:24:01,508 --> 01:24:03,544
Such lazy lives they used to lead

2053
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:06,180
Now they are carrying a big load
on their heads

2054
01:24:06,213 --> 01:24:08,882
And are made to run everywhere.

2055
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:11,518
What king size lives they used to lead!

2056
01:24:11,552 --> 01:24:14,121
What king size lives they used to lead!

2057
01:24:14,121 --> 01:24:15,722
Now their life is a big mess

2058
01:24:15,756 --> 01:24:18,525
They've been pushed into their own graves

2059
01:24:18,592 --> 01:24:23,964
Oh son! Whatever you touch becomes a disaster

2060
01:24:23,964 --> 01:24:26,400
It's the god's will

2061
01:24:26,934 --> 01:24:31,138
You didn't value home when you were there

2062
01:24:31,171 --> 01:24:32,906
Now with a simple twist of fate,

2063
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:34,842
look how your story has changed

2064
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:36,910
Prisoner clothes,

2065
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:38,946
criminal gangs

2066
01:24:38,946 --> 01:24:40,414
and these four walls
are now your friends

2067
01:24:40,447 --> 01:24:42,783
Hey, Gaddalakonda Ganesh.

2068
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:44,451
I am so happy to see you here

2069
01:24:44,484 --> 01:24:45,185
Thanks Anna

2070
01:24:45,219 --> 01:24:48,021
No matter what, great achievement man,
Respect.

2071
01:24:48,055 --> 01:24:50,490
When I look at you
I feel like I'm looking into a mirror.

2072
01:24:50,524 --> 01:24:52,192
Hey, they're from our clan.

2073
01:24:52,392 --> 01:24:55,162
He is Shankar, cheating case.

2074
01:24:55,195 --> 01:24:55,929
Oh, nice to meet you.

2075
01:24:55,996 --> 01:24:58,031
He is Mastan, murder attempt.

2076
01:24:58,065 --> 01:24:59,666
Oh no, namaste.

2077
01:25:01,101 --> 01:25:05,105
The best batch in Chanchal Guda jail
was our batch.

2078
01:25:05,706 --> 01:25:06,707
2008 batch

2079
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:08,675
Oh my! everybody was a diamond.

2080
01:25:08,675 --> 01:25:10,811
You see that ground over there...

2081
01:25:10,844 --> 01:25:12,179
You can do any work there.

2082
01:25:12,312 --> 01:25:13,881
If you take one full round,

2083
01:25:13,914 --> 01:25:15,282
You'll burn 200 calories.

2084
01:25:15,315 --> 01:25:16,216
You see that right?

2085
01:25:16,216 --> 01:25:18,619
You can gossip with your
cellmates there in the evenings.

2086
01:25:18,652 --> 01:25:19,887
You won't even remember your wife.

2087
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,989
The next batch will get good facilities,

2088
01:25:22,022 --> 01:25:24,825
Western toilets, tissue papers.

2089
01:25:24,825 --> 01:25:27,294
The only lurking fear is for

2090
01:25:27,294 --> 01:25:30,297
when they'll send you out of this jail
for good behaviour.

2091
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:31,131
You guys won't be sent.

2092
01:25:31,164 --> 01:25:32,566
Have you had the tea?

2093
01:25:32,566 --> 01:25:34,168
Goat milk, it's healthy.

2094
01:25:35,235 --> 01:25:36,703
SRIKANTH CHITTI

2095
01:25:36,737 --> 01:25:40,107
The clean mirror which was your life
Has been shattered to pieces

2096
01:25:45,412 --> 01:25:47,414
It should come crawling to me.

2097
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:57,391
Srikanth.

2098
01:25:57,424 --> 01:26:01,628
the emporium has shut down
just as you had wanted.

2099
01:26:06,533 --> 01:26:07,367
Hmm

2100
01:26:07,634 --> 01:26:08,435
Look

2101
01:26:08,435 --> 01:26:10,470
criminals, 420s

2102
01:26:15,475 --> 01:26:17,444
If were at Jogipet right now,

2103
01:26:18,011 --> 01:26:21,315
Karim would have been waking us up
with his Kishore Kumar songs.

2104
01:26:22,749 --> 01:26:24,985
What great songs they were.

2105
01:26:25,586 --> 01:26:28,555
Then we would have gone to Mallesh's shop
and had some chicken.

2106
01:26:29,289 --> 01:26:30,290
MFC

2107
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,927
There's no better chicken.

2108
01:26:35,195 --> 01:26:38,599
Chitchat with friends at the Clock Tower
in the evenings

2109
01:26:38,999 --> 01:26:41,768
Manjeera Dam love failures,

2110
01:26:42,736 --> 01:26:44,738
Everybody's always asking about us

2111
01:26:45,205 --> 01:26:46,206
Srikanth,

2112
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,009
When is are you holding
a function at our house?

2113
01:26:50,944 --> 01:26:53,247
There wasn't function I wasn't at, in Jogipet.

2114
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:58,218
Will we go back to Jogipet?

2115
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:03,023
Sir, the last call from this
phone went to this girl.

2116
01:27:03,757 --> 01:27:04,491
Umm...

2117
01:27:07,661 --> 01:27:08,395
Hello.

2118
01:27:08,729 --> 01:27:09,563
Tell me.

2119
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:11,098
You have to tell...

2120
01:27:11,598 --> 01:27:12,833
You have to tell me.

2121
01:27:13,267 --> 01:27:14,568
What did you eat?

2122
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:17,070
Tomato daal and brinjal curry.

2123
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:25,445
From frogs in the well,
we have become crabs in the lake.

2124
01:27:25,579 --> 01:27:27,481
Hey, you have been granted bail.

2125
01:27:27,514 --> 01:27:28,348
Bail?

2126
01:27:28,382 --> 01:27:29,616
Who granted us bail?

2127
01:27:29,650 --> 01:27:30,851
If I don't tell you, then you won't leave?

2128
01:27:30,918 --> 01:27:31,685
We won't leave.

2129
01:27:31,919 --> 01:27:33,220
Then stay here.

2130
01:27:33,453 --> 01:27:34,188
Sir

2131
01:27:35,088 --> 01:27:37,024
Who is putting us behind bars...

2132
01:27:37,024 --> 01:27:38,625
Who is bailing us out?

2133
01:27:40,027 --> 01:27:41,895
Life has become a zindagi sir.

2134
01:27:42,496 --> 01:27:43,463
Letâ€™s go.

2135
01:27:52,272 --> 01:27:53,440
Hey, get into the car.

2136
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:54,308
Aah...

2137
01:27:55,742 --> 01:27:56,710
Who is he talking to?

2138
01:27:56,743 --> 01:27:59,112
Hey, I'm talking to you,

2139
01:27:59,179 --> 01:27:59,980
Get into the car.

2140
01:28:00,013 --> 01:28:01,048
Itâ€™s okay, sir. We'll take an auto

2141
01:28:03,317 --> 01:28:04,585
Oho, apparently they're forcing us in.

2142
01:28:04,618 --> 01:28:05,485
Hey come on.

2143
01:28:05,652 --> 01:28:06,954
Donâ€™t be scared, come.

2144
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:07,754
Hey move come,

2145
01:28:08,488 --> 01:28:09,223
Hey...

2146
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:12,092
Do you need a special invitation?

2147
01:28:19,766 --> 01:28:20,634
Hey Mama,

2148
01:28:20,701 --> 01:28:21,668
why does everybody look so peculiar?

2149
01:28:21,702 --> 01:28:23,403
Hey, you please keep quiet.

2150
01:28:27,407 --> 01:28:29,276
If these guys kills us and then bury us?

2151
01:28:29,343 --> 01:28:31,011
There's nothing in my life to gossip about.

2152
01:28:31,111 --> 01:28:32,112
Hey, donâ€™t fear.

2153
01:28:32,813 --> 01:28:34,815
Even after bringing us to such a big den,

2154
01:28:34,848 --> 01:28:38,785
They've still not tied our hands to a chair
and interrogated us,

2155
01:28:38,852 --> 01:28:41,121
Then they're not very dangerous people.

2156
01:28:43,524 --> 01:28:44,424
Aah...

2157
01:28:47,861 --> 01:28:49,663
I mean these guys are better,

2158
01:28:49,796 --> 01:28:51,331
In the other dens, the blindfold you.

2159
01:28:57,037 --> 01:28:57,738
Where is the phone?

2160
01:29:00,274 --> 01:29:01,975
Where is the phone?
-It's switched off sir.

2161
01:29:03,844 --> 01:29:04,945
Who amongst you is Ravi?

2162
01:29:04,945 --> 01:29:06,013
Him onlt, he's Ravi.

2163
01:29:06,046 --> 01:29:06,980
Hello,

2164
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:09,416
are you the one who used
my phone last night?

2165
01:29:09,449 --> 01:29:11,218
Your girlfriend, your lover,
what's her name?

2166
01:29:11,351 --> 01:29:11,852
Suvarna...

2167
01:29:11,852 --> 01:29:12,819
Yeah, to speak with Suvarna

2168
01:29:12,819 --> 01:29:13,720
Yes.

2169
01:29:13,954 --> 01:29:15,355
Why are blushing?

2170
01:29:16,156 --> 01:29:17,724
Why were you using his phone you idiot?

2171
01:29:17,858 --> 01:29:18,325
Hmm?

2172
01:29:18,358 --> 01:29:20,861
I mean, sir's phone.

2173
01:29:20,894 --> 01:29:23,730
Tell where him it is?
Please, try to remember.

2174
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:26,433
You know I forget the person
who serves me drinks also when I'm drunk.

2175
01:29:26,466 --> 01:29:27,234
I'm really disturbed Mama.

2176
01:29:27,234 --> 01:29:28,368
I can't remember anything.

2177
01:29:28,402 --> 01:29:29,570
Oh god...

2178
01:29:29,603 --> 01:29:31,205
Hey, what are you thinking?
What do you remember?

2179
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:32,139
Tell me.

2180
01:29:33,373 --> 01:29:35,175
Sir, generally...

2181
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:38,378
the process in such dens?

2182
01:29:38,545 --> 01:29:39,613
No man, please.

2183
01:29:43,951 --> 01:29:46,954
What den? What process?
What are you talking about?

2184
01:29:46,954 --> 01:29:49,456
I mean, do you cook the rice
before you get the curries,

2185
01:29:49,456 --> 01:29:50,991
Or do you get curries first
and then cook the rice?

2186
01:29:55,996 --> 01:29:58,065
No!

2187
01:30:16,517 --> 01:30:18,185
Hey! It'll hurt, please.

2188
01:30:18,418 --> 01:30:19,419
Don't hit me.

2189
01:30:19,419 --> 01:30:20,787
Okay, one minute,
I'll tell you when I'm ready.

2190
01:30:20,821 --> 01:30:22,789
Ah! it hurts, okay let me come out.

2191
01:30:22,823 --> 01:30:24,791
Let's discuss this once.

2192
01:30:26,393 --> 01:30:28,629
I have stitches on my stomach
from an operation.

2193
01:30:28,629 --> 01:30:30,130
It hurts a lot please let me be.

2194
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:39,206
Okay, stop, I remember, I need to talk to Chanakya sir.

2195
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:41,441
One minute, I remember, I'll tell him.

2196
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:45,179
Sir, please ask them not to hit me.

2197
01:30:45,245 --> 01:30:46,446
I'll find your phone, please.

2198
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:47,447
Give me one chance.

2199
01:30:47,514 --> 01:30:48,715
Just one chance.

2200
01:30:48,749 --> 01:30:49,683
Tell me

2201
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:51,218
Sir, thanks sir.

2202
01:30:51,251 --> 01:30:53,453
Let's recreate what happened that night,

2203
01:30:53,487 --> 01:30:56,256
The exact same situation, step by step.

2204
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:58,158
My friend will remember
where you lost your phone.

2205
01:30:58,225 --> 01:30:59,326
Please don't mind sir,

2206
01:30:59,326 --> 01:31:01,328
He's had memory problem since he was kid.

2207
01:31:01,361 --> 01:31:02,429
Please sir, just once chance.

2208
01:31:04,264 --> 01:31:06,266
Ready sir, hey try hard to remember.

2209
01:31:06,266 --> 01:31:06,967
Okay, mama

2210
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,503
First, we walked into the birthday party
in full spirit.

2211
01:31:10,037 --> 01:31:11,605
Hey Mama!

2212
01:31:11,605 --> 01:31:14,274
Today we have to eat, drink and
enjoy ourselves to the fullest.

2213
01:31:14,341 --> 01:31:15,342
Hey wait man,

2214
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:17,878
Ultimately the politicians' money
is ours no?

2215
01:31:17,945 --> 01:31:19,279
Haa.... Haa... Haa... Haa... Haa....
100% true.

2216
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,682
You werenâ€™t aware of all this, sir

2217
01:31:21,715 --> 01:31:22,916
You were cutting the cake then.

2218
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:29,423
Happy Birthday to sir...
Happy birthday to sir....

2219
01:31:29,623 --> 01:31:30,624
Did you remember anything?

2220
01:31:30,624 --> 01:31:34,962
Happy Birthday to sir, Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to Chanakya,

2221
01:31:34,995 --> 01:31:37,664
Sir.... Very...Happy...

2222
01:31:37,698 --> 01:31:39,833
Eat, take, eat man.

2223
01:31:40,701 --> 01:31:41,368
And then?

2224
01:31:41,568 --> 01:31:43,036
And then we wished you
lived for a hundred years

2225
01:31:43,036 --> 01:31:44,505
and left for our flat.

2226
01:31:44,538 --> 01:31:45,739
there we found your body in our flat, sir.

2227
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:47,774
What did you do in that gap, sir?

2228
01:31:47,808 --> 01:31:49,376
Yeah sir, what did you do?

2229
01:31:49,409 --> 01:31:51,345
Hey, why do we need all those details?

2230
01:31:51,411 --> 01:31:53,413
Powerful people have
a lot on their plate,

2231
01:31:53,447 --> 01:31:54,948
cakes, bullets,

2232
01:31:54,948 --> 01:31:55,916
Did you remember, bro?

2233
01:31:55,949 --> 01:31:57,651
Tch. I don't know man,

2234
01:31:57,684 --> 01:31:58,385
my mind is stuck.

2235
01:31:58,418 --> 01:31:59,653
I can't remember anything.

2236
01:31:59,686 --> 01:32:02,155
Okay. Next, we will enact the part
where we carried your body.

2237
01:32:02,189 --> 01:32:04,191
Hey, I will stake my life against
my brother-in-lawâ€™s life.

2238
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,425
Then you come sir, please.

2239
01:32:05,526 --> 01:32:07,060
We were discuss whether to

2240
01:32:07,094 --> 01:32:08,495
chop you into pieces or
throw you in the river.

2241
01:32:08,495 --> 01:32:10,364
Hey, I got it.

2242
01:32:10,364 --> 01:32:11,498
While I was going this way,

2243
01:32:11,532 --> 01:32:12,933
I picked up the phone
and called Suvarna.

2244
01:32:12,966 --> 01:32:14,201
That was my phone.

2245
01:32:14,234 --> 01:32:15,602
Now, you are saying
that you donâ€™t know.

2246
01:32:17,004 --> 01:32:19,907
Hello, um... tell me.

2247
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:20,607
You have to tell me.

2248
01:32:20,641 --> 01:32:21,875
Um...you have to tell me.

2249
01:32:21,909 --> 01:32:22,676
Have you eaten?

2250
01:32:22,676 --> 01:32:23,243
What have you eaten?

2251
01:32:23,277 --> 01:32:23,944
Yes.

2252
01:32:23,977 --> 01:32:24,878
Tomato man, you?

2253
01:32:24,912 --> 01:32:25,946
I ate a tomato as well.

2254
01:32:25,979 --> 01:32:29,216
Yesterday Tomato, today also Tomato
is it your favourite thing?

2255
01:32:29,383 --> 01:32:29,983
Ha, yours?

2256
01:32:30,017 --> 01:32:30,751
ridge gourd man.

2257
01:32:30,784 --> 01:32:33,720
Hey,how much more of this tomato,
ridge gourd nonsense.

2258
01:32:33,754 --> 01:32:34,855
Tell me, what happened next?

2259
01:32:34,888 --> 01:32:35,722
That's all.

2260
01:32:35,756 --> 01:32:36,823
Do you remember?

2261
01:32:36,857 --> 01:32:38,025
Sir done sir.

2262
01:32:38,091 --> 01:32:39,660
Let's recreate the cramming of the body in the car.

2263
01:32:39,693 --> 01:32:40,928
If you donâ€™t mind,

2264
01:32:40,961 --> 01:32:41,628
one minute,

2265
01:32:41,662 --> 01:32:42,996
I can't hold it in any longer.

2266
01:32:43,864 --> 01:32:44,598
Go and come.

2267
01:32:45,032 --> 01:32:46,400
I will do it. Hey, who is that fellow?

2268
01:32:47,034 --> 01:32:48,435
Hey...Ba... Ba... brother â€“in-law.

2269
01:32:49,736 --> 01:32:51,939
I will bear this nonsense
only till I find my phone.

2270
01:32:51,972 --> 01:32:52,739
Okay

2271
01:32:52,773 --> 01:32:54,308
Once the phone is found,

2272
01:32:54,341 --> 01:32:55,776
get all three of them crushed
under the tipper lorry.

2273
01:32:55,943 --> 01:32:56,643
Okay, brother-in-law.

2274
01:32:57,811 --> 01:32:58,312
Heee...

2275
01:32:58,545 --> 01:33:01,114
If by any chance the phone
falls into Ramachandriah's hands,

2276
01:33:01,648 --> 01:33:03,383
My political career goes kaput.

2277
01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:04,151
Kaput!

2278
01:33:06,353 --> 01:33:09,389
Hey, don't stuff me in.

2279
01:33:09,556 --> 01:33:11,625
Here we crammed the body in
the boot sir. And then,

2280
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:13,660
Something happened
But I canâ€™t remember

2281
01:33:13,827 --> 01:33:16,530
Hey, you can't remember anything!

2282
01:33:16,864 --> 01:33:18,765
Sir, he was completely sloshed then sir.

2283
01:33:20,501 --> 01:33:21,869
Ignore his words.

2284
01:33:21,902 --> 01:33:23,070
Actually, this re-creation
is not working out.

2285
01:33:23,103 --> 01:33:24,004
He wasn't that sloshed.

2286
01:33:24,037 --> 01:33:25,239
Hey!

2287
01:33:25,272 --> 01:33:27,674
You don't remember how drunk he was.

2288
01:33:27,708 --> 01:33:29,142
Try to remember.

2289
01:33:29,142 --> 01:33:32,179
He was stinky we kept
the body in the boot,

2290
01:33:32,179 --> 01:33:33,680
We were so stressed out
we were unable to do anything,

2291
01:33:33,714 --> 01:33:34,715
And got onto the vehicle.

2292
01:33:34,748 --> 01:33:35,849
yes sir, we went from the side,

2293
01:33:35,883 --> 01:33:36,583
Are you mad?

2294
01:33:36,617 --> 01:33:37,784
Sir, I wasnâ€™t completely zonked out.

2295
01:33:37,784 --> 01:33:38,719
and then we sat down.

2296
01:33:40,153 --> 01:33:40,954
Where is Ravi man?

2297
01:33:40,988 --> 01:33:43,257
I have the capacity to consume
2 full bottles and 4 beers.

2298
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:44,858
If I sit down till the sun rises.

2299
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:46,026
I was not completely zonked.

2300
01:33:46,026 --> 01:33:46,827
I winked at him no?

2301
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:48,028
I winked as well.

2302
01:33:48,061 --> 01:33:49,463
I winked to let you know that

2303
01:33:49,496 --> 01:33:51,298
It looks like they're going to kill us,

2304
01:33:51,331 --> 01:33:52,032
Let's get out of here quickly.

2305
01:33:52,032 --> 01:33:54,001
and get that Ravi along.

2306
01:33:54,001 --> 01:33:55,936
Thereâ€™s so much depth behind a wink Mama.

2307
01:33:55,936 --> 01:33:57,638
He was not in a position to talk sir,

2308
01:33:57,671 --> 01:33:59,139
He fainted sir,

2309
01:33:59,173 --> 01:34:00,007
I'll kill him man.

2310
01:34:00,007 --> 01:34:01,141
They are not allowing me to speak sir.

2311
01:34:01,175 --> 01:34:02,276
We threw him into the back sat

2312
01:34:02,276 --> 01:34:03,076
because he was
becoming a problem,

2313
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:04,077
Allow me to tell....

2314
01:34:04,111 --> 01:34:04,945
Go inside.... go inside...

2315
01:34:04,978 --> 01:34:06,146
That's when the power went,

2316
01:34:06,146 --> 01:34:08,382
We couldn't see anything,

2317
01:34:08,415 --> 01:34:10,751
So I slid inside and shut the door like this...

2318
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,502
Wasn't that recreation brilliant?

2319
01:34:30,103 --> 01:34:31,972
Sai Wines should be around here,

2320
01:34:32,005 --> 01:34:33,507
can you please stop there?

2321
01:34:34,374 --> 01:34:36,743
Couldn't you understand why I was winking?

2322
01:34:36,944 --> 01:34:38,445
When I went to pee,

2323
01:34:38,512 --> 01:34:40,914
They were making a plan to kill us.

2324
01:34:40,948 --> 01:34:42,649
Apparently there were some
videos in the phone.

2325
01:34:42,783 --> 01:34:45,085
They're scared for their lives
about the videos going public.

2326
01:34:45,118 --> 01:34:46,820
This is our chance.

2327
01:34:46,854 --> 01:34:48,188
If we find that phone.

2328
01:34:48,222 --> 01:34:49,289
He will listen to what we say.

2329
01:34:49,323 --> 01:34:51,325
We can first ask him to drop
the case against us.

2330
01:34:51,859 --> 01:34:53,827
Hey, please, tell where that phone is?

2331
01:34:53,827 --> 01:34:55,028
I beg you, please.

2332
01:35:01,835 --> 01:35:03,070
Hey, not through the gate,

2333
01:35:03,103 --> 01:35:04,605
his party members are there.

2334
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:14,181
Watchman, watchman!

2335
01:35:14,948 --> 01:35:15,916
Come here.

2336
01:35:15,949 --> 01:35:16,783
Hey watchman

2337
01:35:16,817 --> 01:35:17,784
Here he is,

2338
01:35:18,252 --> 01:35:19,286
Hey, where is our vehicle?

2339
01:35:19,586 --> 01:35:20,654
I donâ€™t know, sir.

2340
01:35:20,754 --> 01:35:22,389
Aah, aren't you the watchman,

2341
01:35:22,422 --> 01:35:23,190
Who will know, if not for you?

2342
01:35:23,223 --> 01:35:24,625
Just because I'm the watchman,

2343
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:25,792
doesn't mean I have to
watch only your car.

2344
01:35:25,826 --> 01:35:27,628
This guy only must have stolen the vehicle,

2345
01:35:27,661 --> 01:35:29,062
I swear on my mother, I don't know.

2346
01:35:29,096 --> 01:35:32,599
Sir, I'd lose my job,
please don't tell anybody here.

2347
01:35:32,599 --> 01:35:33,934
Who could have stolen the car?

2348
01:35:33,934 --> 01:35:34,668
I really don't know sir.

2349
01:35:35,135 --> 01:35:37,271
Hey, his phone must have fallen in the boot.

2350
01:35:39,106 --> 01:35:40,174
Those rowdies will be here,

2351
01:35:40,174 --> 01:35:41,675
Let's get out of here.

2352
01:35:43,143 --> 01:35:44,545
Mama, let me go meet Chitti once.

2353
01:35:44,578 --> 01:35:45,212
I don't know if I can meet her later.

2354
01:35:45,245 --> 01:35:45,712
Now?
-Please.

2355
01:35:45,746 --> 01:35:47,214
I don't know if I can meet her again.

2356
01:35:47,281 --> 01:35:48,348
Life has a become a zindagi

2357
01:35:48,382 --> 01:35:49,383
And there's only one zindagi.

2358
01:36:01,995 --> 01:36:04,698
Hmm...pointed to be noted, your honor.

2359
01:36:07,234 --> 01:36:08,035
Chitti.

2360
01:36:08,068 --> 01:36:09,002
Srikanth!

2361
01:36:10,337 --> 01:36:11,338
Yeah.

2362
01:36:11,805 --> 01:36:13,040
Itâ€™s very cold...

2363
01:36:18,145 --> 01:36:21,315
I didn't think you'd
be able to get out of jail.

2364
01:36:22,249 --> 01:36:25,285
Even I didn't think it was possible
after your arguments, Kamakshi

2365
01:36:25,319 --> 01:36:28,655
Srikanth, you are still angry with me, no?

2366
01:36:28,689 --> 01:36:29,389
Huh....

2367
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:30,891
Tch

2368
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:34,194
I agreed that I was wrong no?

2369
01:36:34,261 --> 01:36:35,062
Oho!

2370
01:36:36,196 --> 01:36:38,532
Finally got some sense into your head.

2371
01:36:39,166 --> 01:36:41,235
It's okay, you realized
your mistake at least.

2372
01:36:41,401 --> 01:36:45,372
That's why I'm trying the fix
the mistake I made, all by myself.

2373
01:36:45,606 --> 01:36:46,306
What do you mean?

2374
01:36:46,707 --> 01:36:48,976
I thought I could of present
my arguments before court again.

2375
01:36:49,476 --> 01:36:50,878
I will plead guilty.

2376
01:36:50,978 --> 01:36:51,645
Hey!

2377
01:36:51,678 --> 01:36:53,680
If you plead guilty,
you'll be sentenced for.

2378
01:36:53,714 --> 01:36:55,516
Will be lesser than the term
I will get if you defend me, Subalakshmi

2379
01:36:55,816 --> 01:36:58,085
Oh my, oh my.

2380
01:36:59,186 --> 01:37:02,256
You have no feeling of love towards me.

2381
01:37:02,723 --> 01:37:04,091
Did you even miss me?

2382
01:37:05,626 --> 01:37:07,227
What are you saying Srikanth?

2383
01:37:08,161 --> 01:37:10,564
Whenever I read about any
criminal in the newspaper,

2384
01:37:10,597 --> 01:37:11,665
you come to my mind

2385
01:37:11,865 --> 01:37:12,566
Do you know that?

2386
01:37:14,701 --> 01:37:15,435
Really?

2387
01:37:17,271 --> 01:37:19,907
Even I wrote only your name
all over the prison walls.

2388
01:37:21,909 --> 01:37:22,876
Psst.

2389
01:37:26,346 --> 01:37:29,049
Chitti all our clothes have gotten dirty,

2390
01:37:29,082 --> 01:37:31,151
Can I borrow your father's clothes?

2391
01:37:31,418 --> 01:37:35,189
my Father-in-lawâ€™s suit and boots

2392
01:37:35,889 --> 01:37:37,791
Can't you always wear a suit?

2393
01:37:37,824 --> 01:37:39,593
Decent, like my father.

2394
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:41,895
If you put my Chanchal Guda
cellmate also in a suit,

2395
01:37:41,895 --> 01:37:43,997
He'd look more decent than your father.

2396
01:37:44,164 --> 01:37:45,132
As if your dad is some Dec-

2397
01:37:45,132 --> 01:37:45,866
Hah!

2398
01:37:45,899 --> 01:37:46,867
Really?

2399
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:49,069
Tell me son, tell me.

2400
01:37:49,336 --> 01:37:51,605
Something about your
colleagues and cellmates.

2401
01:37:51,638 --> 01:37:52,706
It wasn't about you uncle.

2402
01:37:53,106 --> 01:37:53,674
Uncle?

2403
01:37:53,907 --> 01:37:54,908
Sorry, father-in-law.

2404
01:37:55,042 --> 01:37:56,043
Father-in-law?

2405
01:37:56,176 --> 01:37:58,545
Hey, you're talking to Satish Janardhan,

2406
01:37:58,545 --> 01:37:59,513
Okay Satish

2407
01:37:59,546 --> 01:38:02,416
What is this Chitti? Why are you talking
to this bloody criminal?

2408
01:38:02,449 --> 01:38:03,417
Excuse me Satish,

2409
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:07,154
according to Indian constipation,
I am still uncriminal till proof.

2410
01:38:07,254 --> 01:38:08,589
Hey, it's the constitution.

2411
01:38:08,856 --> 01:38:11,625
Are you even qualified enough
to talk to my daughter?

2412
01:38:11,658 --> 01:38:14,561
Do you even know what sort of
matches I've found for her?

2413
01:38:14,595 --> 01:38:16,096
Aah...P.H.D,

2414
01:38:16,129 --> 01:38:17,931
Have you ever heard about a P.H.D.?

2415
01:38:17,931 --> 01:38:20,334
P.H.D....

2416
01:38:20,334 --> 01:38:21,668
I mean, I've heard the letters separately.

2417
01:38:21,735 --> 01:38:22,870
It's the first time I've heard it together.

2418
01:38:22,903 --> 01:38:24,671
To be frank, it seems
the order of alphabets seems wrong.

2419
01:38:24,771 --> 01:38:27,274
Because after P, it's Q and R Chitti

2420
01:38:27,307 --> 01:38:28,242
Did your father go to
a Telugu medium school?

2421
01:38:28,275 --> 01:38:31,245
Chitti, do you know how grand
your wedding was supposed to be?

2422
01:38:31,245 --> 01:38:33,213
Police, Lawyers, Politicians....

2423
01:38:33,247 --> 01:38:34,915
I will call them sir

2424
01:38:35,048 --> 01:38:37,851
I got really close to
the lawyer Padmanabham during this case.

2425
01:38:37,885 --> 01:38:40,320
So now, MLA Chanakya
and all those ministers,

2426
01:38:40,354 --> 01:38:42,189
will be at out wedding.

2427
01:38:42,456 --> 01:38:43,557
What the F-

2428
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:44,691
Hell, and heaven

2429
01:38:44,691 --> 01:38:46,627
Did notice how well our English matched?

2430
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:47,661
Same pinch.

2431
01:38:47,794 --> 01:38:52,766
Chitti, if you either talk to him or
his friends once again

2432
01:38:52,766 --> 01:38:53,267
Sir!

2433
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:55,135
Say whatever you
want to about me,

2434
01:38:55,135 --> 01:38:56,436
but my friends are
diamonds, sir.

2435
01:38:56,436 --> 01:38:59,006
Mama, your mama's clothes are real nice.

2436
01:38:59,072 --> 01:38:59,740
Hey!

2437
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,176
Those are my wedding night clothes.

2438
01:39:02,209 --> 01:39:03,177
Who are you guys?

2439
01:39:03,377 --> 01:39:04,211
Neighbours sir.

2440
01:39:04,411 --> 01:39:05,379
Neighbours?

2441
01:39:05,546 --> 01:39:08,115
Chitti, Please tell me you're not in love...

2442
01:39:08,115 --> 01:39:08,782
Aah... Aah....

2443
01:39:08,815 --> 01:39:10,050
Tell him, Tell him.

2444
01:39:10,083 --> 01:39:10,918
Ew, no.

2445
01:39:11,418 --> 01:39:12,052
Get out.

2446
01:39:12,152 --> 01:39:13,987
Sir, I've not come to attend your class,

2447
01:39:14,154 --> 01:39:15,155
I came for Chitti.

2448
01:39:15,189 --> 01:39:16,223
I will leave only if Chitti asks me to.

2449
01:39:16,423 --> 01:39:17,024
Chitti?

2450
01:39:17,524 --> 01:39:18,358
Get out, Srikanth.

2451
01:39:18,392 --> 01:39:20,894
Chitti, don't be afraid because
your dad is here.

2452
01:39:21,061 --> 01:39:22,429
Tell him what's in your heart.

2453
01:39:22,462 --> 01:39:23,230
Get out, Srikanth.

2454
01:39:23,263 --> 01:39:24,398
Get out, Srikanth.

2455
01:39:24,431 --> 01:39:27,034
From the heart, get out, don't come back.

2456
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:28,101
Goodbye Zubaida

2457
01:39:28,135 --> 01:39:29,503
Immediately send this for dry cleaning.

2458
01:39:29,736 --> 01:39:30,771
Hey, remove your clothes.

2459
01:39:31,138 --> 01:39:32,206
Do you want me strip here sir?

2460
01:39:32,706 --> 01:39:34,441
No, not here, outside.

2461
01:39:39,546 --> 01:39:41,415
I cooked some rice, get the curries.

2462
01:39:42,049 --> 01:39:43,817
This is a reunion party.
2008 CHANCHALGUDA JAIL REUNION

2463
01:39:44,117 --> 01:39:45,285
I'm warning you right now.

2464
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:47,788
I'll punch you if you mention
intermittent fasting, keto diet.

2465
01:39:47,955 --> 01:39:49,056
Drink like a maniac,

2466
01:39:49,122 --> 01:39:51,058
But you cannot puke anywhere.

2467
01:39:55,229 --> 01:39:55,696
Hello.

2468
01:39:55,996 --> 01:39:57,164
Anna, it's me Srikanth.

2469
01:39:57,598 --> 01:39:58,599
Chain-snatching, Srikanth?

2470
01:39:58,932 --> 01:40:00,667
No, murder Srikanth.

2471
01:40:01,702 --> 01:40:02,936
Then you have to mention it no?

2472
01:40:03,003 --> 01:40:04,538
This is about a theft.

2473
01:40:04,805 --> 01:40:05,973
Do you want me to do it?

2474
01:40:05,973 --> 01:40:07,508
No Anna, the theft has occurred.

2475
01:40:07,541 --> 01:40:09,042
Then, why did you call me?

2476
01:40:09,076 --> 01:40:12,145
Someone stole my car,
my closest friend Anna.

2477
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:14,314
Definitely, someone from our.....

2478
01:40:14,515 --> 01:40:16,016
I'll call you back.

2479
01:40:16,483 --> 01:40:17,684
Hey Sharif,
-Anna

2480
01:40:20,954 --> 01:40:21,722
Anna

2481
01:40:21,989 --> 01:40:27,327
Your car was stolen by that MLA's fan

2482
01:40:31,265 --> 01:40:34,034
How are we back here again?

2483
01:40:35,536 --> 01:40:37,171
Hey, brother, what are they drinking?

2484
01:40:37,171 --> 01:40:38,705
How can we get the phone
from inside the car?

2485
01:40:38,705 --> 01:40:41,074
Hey, psst...Srikanth?

2486
01:40:41,542 --> 01:40:43,177
Hey what happened?

2487
01:40:44,111 --> 01:40:44,978
Who? Oh my!

2488
01:40:45,479 --> 01:40:46,346
Came....

2489
01:40:46,547 --> 01:40:47,381
Why did you come here?

2490
01:40:47,414 --> 01:40:47,748
Hi

2491
01:40:47,781 --> 01:40:48,382
Hi?

2492
01:40:49,283 --> 01:40:50,284
Namaste, Namaste.

2493
01:40:50,284 --> 01:40:51,218
Did you call her here?

2494
01:40:52,286 --> 01:40:53,086
Why did you call her?

2495
01:40:53,287 --> 01:40:55,289
Srikanth...
-Umm..

2496
01:40:55,489 --> 01:40:57,925
Srikanth...
-Hah...

2497
01:40:57,958 --> 01:40:58,959
Srikanth

2498
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,261
Sorry Srikanth...

2499
01:41:03,163 --> 01:41:06,733
Actually I need to apologise to you.

2500
01:41:06,767 --> 01:41:08,569
No, I need to apologise.

2501
01:41:08,602 --> 01:41:10,404
No, I need to apologise first.

2502
01:41:10,404 --> 01:41:12,906
No, no. I insulted you the other day,
before my father.

2503
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:14,875
Hey, but I insulted your father as well.

2504
01:41:14,908 --> 01:41:16,076
No, I have to apologise first no?

2505
01:41:16,143 --> 01:41:17,211
No, I have to say it first.

2506
01:41:17,244 --> 01:41:17,878
He has started it again

2507
01:41:17,911 --> 01:41:20,581
You're trying to dominate me here also?

2508
01:41:20,714 --> 01:41:21,715
Okay

2509
01:41:22,149 --> 01:41:24,551
If there's any conflict
between the two of us,

2510
01:41:24,551 --> 01:41:25,986
you apologise to me first.

2511
01:41:26,019 --> 01:41:27,354
Did you see that?

2512
01:41:27,387 --> 01:41:28,155
Thu.

2513
01:41:28,322 --> 01:41:30,624
That's how I keep her in my control.

2514
01:41:32,326 --> 01:41:33,026
Idiot.

2515
01:41:33,026 --> 01:41:33,327
Come here.

2516
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:34,895
Okay, coming.

2517
01:41:34,895 --> 01:41:36,163
Mama, come here
- Tell me.

2518
01:41:36,763 --> 01:41:39,299
Listen to me carefully,

2519
01:41:39,333 --> 01:41:41,201
We need to enter with the 'pherfect' planning.

2520
01:41:41,235 --> 01:41:41,602
okay...

2521
01:41:41,635 --> 01:41:42,736
I've thought everything through.

2522
01:41:42,870 --> 01:41:43,937
I'll enter first.

2523
01:41:43,937 --> 01:41:44,972
Sekhar follows me.

2524
01:41:45,005 --> 01:41:45,772
And then you.

2525
01:41:45,806 --> 01:41:47,975
We should run inside without being spotted.

2526
01:41:47,975 --> 01:41:49,109
Don't use your original names inside.

2527
01:41:49,142 --> 01:41:51,378
If I call out for Pushkar,
you need to respond with Sangamesh

2528
01:41:51,411 --> 01:41:52,279
If anybody comes in the way,

2529
01:41:52,312 --> 01:41:53,313
Don't flee.

2530
01:41:53,347 --> 01:41:55,916
I'll give you a signal,
like this, 63 degrees.

2531
01:41:55,949 --> 01:41:57,684
but you guys don't respond
with the 72 degrees,

2532
01:41:57,718 --> 01:41:58,252
it will confuse me.

2533
01:41:58,285 --> 01:41:59,286
As soon as the phone
is in my hands,

2534
01:41:59,286 --> 01:42:02,256
I'll escape like
Jackie Chan in the car.

2535
01:42:02,289 --> 01:42:04,224
If anyone obstructs us,
We'll beat them to pulp,

2536
01:42:04,258 --> 01:42:05,025
Drink their blood.

2537
01:42:05,058 --> 01:42:05,692
and get out of there.

2538
01:42:05,726 --> 01:42:07,227
If any of you faces a problem.

2539
01:42:07,294 --> 01:42:10,130
You guys, make this sound.

2540
01:42:10,163 --> 01:42:12,866
Then I'll come there, making horse sounds
- You'd know it's me.

2541
01:42:13,834 --> 01:42:14,368
Stop it bro.

2542
01:42:14,535 --> 01:42:15,636
What an idea Mama,

2543
01:42:15,869 --> 01:42:18,605
My brain was fed on ladies finger
when I made this plan.

2544
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:20,541
Chitti, don't get involved in
these dangerous lives.

2545
01:42:21,675 --> 01:42:22,409
Hey, where's Chitti?

2546
01:42:23,410 --> 01:42:24,444
Where did she go?

2547
01:42:24,478 --> 01:42:25,512
Look there.

2548
01:42:25,546 --> 01:42:26,346
Cheese.

2549
01:42:26,346 --> 01:42:27,748
Oh man.

2550
01:42:28,415 --> 01:42:30,450
What a woman, Mama

2551
01:42:30,484 --> 01:42:31,985
Hey, wait.

2552
01:42:33,353 --> 01:42:34,054
It's nice

2553
01:42:34,388 --> 01:42:35,155
Aah....

2554
01:42:35,689 --> 01:42:36,690
What are you doing?

2555
01:42:37,624 --> 01:42:38,525
Sending it to my father.

2556
01:42:39,626 --> 01:42:40,894
What does your father do?

2557
01:42:40,894 --> 01:42:41,895
He's an S.I, the police.

2558
01:42:41,929 --> 01:42:42,796
S.I?

2559
01:42:42,829 --> 01:42:43,664
Hmm...

2560
01:42:43,697 --> 01:42:45,632
I've even shared a live location

2561
01:42:45,666 --> 01:42:47,334
Why did you send him a live location?

2562
01:42:48,402 --> 01:42:52,472
Because I've shared everything
with my father since I was a kid.

2563
01:42:52,506 --> 01:42:54,308
Where do you have to go?

2564
01:42:54,308 --> 01:42:55,442
We'll drop you.

2565
01:42:55,475 --> 01:42:58,946
Take a right from the Jubilee Hills circle,

2566
01:42:58,979 --> 01:43:00,881
-Go drop madam.

2567
01:43:00,914 --> 01:43:03,650
You know that coffee shop no?

2568
01:43:03,684 --> 01:43:05,919
Okay madam, our boy will drop you.

2569
01:43:10,757 --> 01:43:11,959
There are two goons there.

2570
01:43:12,693 --> 01:43:15,195
Mama, we've arrived at
a life and death situation.

2571
01:43:16,296 --> 01:43:19,399
Even if one of us dies, as long
as the other two are happy.

2572
01:43:19,433 --> 01:43:20,133
Hey

2573
01:43:21,702 --> 01:43:23,370
Decide who that person is
amongst the two of you.

2574
01:43:23,403 --> 01:43:24,304
What the hell?

2575
01:43:24,371 --> 01:43:26,540
And what if something happens to us?

2576
01:43:26,573 --> 01:43:27,307
Even if anything happens to you,

2577
01:43:27,341 --> 01:43:28,742
nobody in your family is
going to feel bad about it.

2578
01:43:28,775 --> 01:43:29,977
You're that one amongst us.

2579
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:30,711
What, the scape goat?

2580
01:43:30,744 --> 01:43:31,545
No, an inspiration.

2581
01:43:31,578 --> 01:43:32,246
Hey get out.

2582
01:43:32,246 --> 01:43:33,013
Hey!

2583
01:43:33,046 --> 01:43:35,148
Your name is the first
name I write with a pen.

2584
01:43:35,182 --> 01:43:37,484
Mama, when you didn't
talk to me for two days,

2585
01:43:37,518 --> 01:43:38,552
I cried for seven days.

2586
01:43:38,552 --> 01:43:40,053
Not those same old stories again.

2587
01:43:40,087 --> 01:43:40,988
Hey, let me go.

2588
01:43:41,021 --> 01:43:42,322
Let us follow you.

2589
01:43:42,356 --> 01:43:43,657
We'll follow as soon as you lead us out.

2590
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:44,992
For once, you please go.

2591
01:43:45,025 --> 01:43:47,327
Please, you go.

2592
01:44:09,016 --> 01:44:15,822
Sorry, just a minute.

2593
01:44:15,856 --> 01:44:17,291
Hey, what Th-

2594
01:44:17,357 --> 01:44:18,358
Look there!

2595
01:44:18,559 --> 01:44:21,228
Die, die, die.

2596
01:44:21,261 --> 01:44:21,995
Oh! no.

2597
01:44:23,597 --> 01:44:25,365
Hey, come!

2598
01:44:25,399 --> 01:44:27,301
He is calling us, let's go.

2599
01:44:27,367 --> 01:44:28,368
How are you?

2600
01:44:28,702 --> 01:44:30,537
Open Sesame

2601
01:44:31,705 --> 01:44:33,207
Hey, look around.

2602
01:44:33,907 --> 01:44:34,675
What is this?

2603
01:44:35,175 --> 01:44:36,743
I'll hit it with this rock and it'll open.

2604
01:44:38,045 --> 01:44:39,246
Donâ€™t make any noise!

2605
01:44:40,013 --> 01:44:40,647
Sorry

2606
01:44:40,714 --> 01:44:41,348
Did it open?

2607
01:44:41,481 --> 01:44:43,016
Look for the phone.

2608
01:44:43,884 --> 01:44:45,986
At the bottom, to the left.

2609
01:44:45,986 --> 01:44:46,553
Look under the mat.

2610
01:44:46,587 --> 01:44:47,588
I am checking, don't make any noise.

2611
01:44:47,621 --> 01:44:48,856
Below the Tyre.

2612
01:44:48,856 --> 01:44:49,890
They are coming, quick.

2613
01:44:50,057 --> 01:44:51,225
MLA Chanakya,
-Zindabad, zindabad.

2614
01:44:51,258 --> 01:44:53,994
Hey, hide, they've come.

2615
01:44:54,027 --> 01:44:58,031
Spinach Fry, May MLA Chanakya never die.

2616
01:44:58,065 --> 01:45:02,569
Spinach Fry, May MLA Chanakya never die.

2617
01:45:03,337 --> 01:45:07,608
Hey, this is the car they used
to carry our boss' body.

2618
01:45:07,708 --> 01:45:10,511
That's why I stole this car
taking a great risk.

2619
01:45:10,744 --> 01:45:15,282
Now tell me
what to do with this shitty car.

2620
01:45:15,415 --> 01:45:17,751
-We will burn it, bro.
-We will burn it.

2621
01:45:17,951 --> 01:45:23,023
If they burn the car,
the phone will be destroyed with it.

2622
01:45:23,190 --> 01:45:24,825
Oh, God.

2623
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,727
Hey, stop it.

2624
01:45:27,127 --> 01:45:28,996
We won't find justice in the courts.

2625
01:45:28,996 --> 01:45:33,000
Those three are not punished.
We have to change the system.

2626
01:45:33,166 --> 01:45:36,003
-I'll change it, bro.
-I'll change it, bro.

2627
01:45:36,136 --> 01:45:38,372
You always get to do the job.
Let's give him a chance this time.

2628
01:45:38,472 --> 01:45:39,139
Thanks, bro.

2629
01:45:39,173 --> 01:45:44,545
We have to give a presentation
regarding tomorrow's location. Let's go.

2630
01:45:52,352 --> 01:45:53,787
Hey, Ravi is stuck in the vehicle.

2631
01:45:55,255 --> 01:45:56,957
What do they have planned?

2632
01:45:56,990 --> 01:45:58,492
Where are they taking him?

2633
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:05,832
Mla Chanakya, Zindabad.

2634
01:46:06,667 --> 01:46:07,768
Sir what's your Spandana (response) regarding this?

2635
01:46:07,801 --> 01:46:09,303
I'm not in touch with
Spandana at all these days.

2636
01:46:09,603 --> 01:46:10,504
Sir, what do you want?

2637
01:46:10,537 --> 01:46:11,405
I want justice.

2638
01:46:11,438 --> 01:46:15,676
Three criminals have tried killing
my brother in this vehicle.

2639
01:46:15,843 --> 01:46:17,544
We haven't gotten any justice yet.

2640
01:46:17,578 --> 01:46:19,713
What are you planning to do now?

2641
01:46:19,947 --> 01:46:23,050
If I don't get a call from
the supreme court within two minutes.

2642
01:46:23,050 --> 01:46:24,718
I'll burn the car right here.

2643
01:46:24,785 --> 01:46:27,054
Not just the car, even the police,

2644
01:46:27,187 --> 01:46:28,222
Okay, maybe not.

2645
01:46:28,255 --> 01:46:29,990
Where are you guys?
-Right outside.

2646
01:46:30,090 --> 01:46:31,091
Don't worry.

2647
01:46:31,091 --> 01:46:31,892
Are you coming here or not?

2648
01:46:31,959 --> 01:46:32,526
Coming,

2649
01:46:32,559 --> 01:46:33,527
Please come quick....

2650
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:34,795
They are all drinking around the vehicle.

2651
01:46:34,828 --> 01:46:35,562
We are don't have a chance.

2652
01:46:35,596 --> 01:46:38,599
Mama, don't worry,
give me five minutes, please.

2653
01:46:38,632 --> 01:46:39,733
I'll do something and get you out of there.

2654
01:46:39,766 --> 01:46:41,401
Spinach Fry, May MLA Chanakya never die.

2655
01:46:41,435 --> 01:46:49,176
Spinach Fry, May MLA Chanakya never die.

2656
01:46:49,977 --> 01:46:51,979
We will not stop this here,

2657
01:46:52,012 --> 01:46:53,947
We'll do an on foot March
till we reach America!

2658
01:46:53,981 --> 01:46:56,783
Open the gate, chanakya is great

2659
01:46:56,783 --> 01:46:59,086
Open the gate, chanakya is great

2660
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:05,225
Spinach Fry, May MLA Chanakya never die.

2661
01:47:05,259 --> 01:47:06,660
Where are you from?

2662
01:47:06,693 --> 01:47:09,229
I am the first person to
have erected a 60 ft. cut out

2663
01:47:09,263 --> 01:47:10,998
of Chanakya Anna in Hyderabad.

2664
01:47:11,031 --> 01:47:11,832
Super!

2665
01:47:11,865 --> 01:47:14,501
How dare they touch out Chanakya!

2666
01:47:14,535 --> 01:47:17,037
Chanakya is our God.

2667
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:19,072
Anna, you need to definitely
get those three punished.

2668
01:47:19,106 --> 01:47:20,874
I'm not Chankaya's genuine fan, you are.

2669
01:47:21,108 --> 01:47:22,242
We'll punish them with your hands.

2670
01:47:22,242 --> 01:47:28,482
Open the gate, Chanakya is great

2671
01:47:28,515 --> 01:47:31,385
Spinach Fry, May MLA Chanakya never die.

2672
01:47:31,418 --> 01:47:34,788
Here, he needs to turn
two ashes in two minutes.

2673
01:47:34,888 --> 01:47:35,889
Light him up.

2674
01:47:35,989 --> 01:47:38,425
You want me to light him on fire?

2675
01:47:38,458 --> 01:47:39,526
You want me to light it?

2676
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:40,327
Yes, you.

2677
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:42,262
I'm burning my own...

2678
01:47:43,063 --> 01:47:45,132
Can we light them first?
They look dangerous.

2679
01:47:45,132 --> 01:47:46,433
He looks innocent.

2680
01:47:47,234 --> 01:47:48,902
Have you looked his eyes properly?

2681
01:47:48,969 --> 01:47:50,771
He's the bigger culprit.

2682
01:47:50,771 --> 01:47:51,705
Light him up.

2683
01:47:51,738 --> 01:47:53,774
I can recognise the kind of person he is,
just by his eyes.

2684
01:47:53,807 --> 01:47:55,342
You're right Anna.

2685
01:47:56,143 --> 01:48:00,581
Whoever dare touched MLA Chanakya,
should turn to ashes.

2686
01:48:00,714 --> 01:48:03,584
How dare you touch him?
I'll turn you into ash.

2687
01:48:04,017 --> 01:48:06,420
Hey man, look at all the problems
these two bring you.

2688
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:08,622
My father always told me
that they were a bad influence.

2689
01:48:08,689 --> 01:48:10,724
Anna!

2690
01:48:10,757 --> 01:48:11,692
-You don't worry.

2691
01:48:11,725 --> 01:48:13,493
Anna, please not petrol,

2692
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:15,229
The rates have really gone up.

2693
01:48:15,262 --> 01:48:17,598
Anna, please listen to me,

2694
01:48:17,631 --> 01:48:19,833
this is a diesel vehicle,

2695
01:48:19,867 --> 01:48:20,767
Petrol won't set it on fire.

2696
01:48:20,767 --> 01:48:21,869
Hey!

2697
01:48:22,870 --> 01:48:25,706
Your vengeance cannot be extinguished
by a small matchstick

2698
01:48:25,739 --> 01:48:28,041
Even if the matchbox is small,
the flame is big.

2699
01:48:28,041 --> 01:48:29,209
It will not suffice,

2700
01:48:29,476 --> 01:48:32,479
If we light a fire here,
it needs to reach Delhi.

2701
01:48:32,479 --> 01:48:33,247
-yes indeed

2702
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:34,581
A volcano needs to surface.

2703
01:48:34,615 --> 01:48:35,249
-yes indeed

2704
01:48:35,249 --> 01:48:35,749
What do you say?

2705
01:48:35,782 --> 01:48:37,851
Sweetest of the sweets is 'Kova'
our annaâ€™s revenge is Lava

2706
01:48:37,885 --> 01:48:39,720
Wow, your slogans are amazing,

2707
01:48:39,753 --> 01:48:41,088
I don't know anything but
the spinach fry slogan

2708
01:48:41,121 --> 01:48:44,157
You can use the slogan Anna,
I have one for every vegetable.

2709
01:48:44,191 --> 01:48:46,393
But who's that man Anna?
- I'll definitely kill him.

2710
01:48:46,393 --> 01:48:47,661
My name is Chanakya Chandu...

2711
01:48:47,794 --> 01:48:49,530
Chanakya sir recently
won an election with one vote right?

2712
01:48:49,596 --> 01:48:50,364
That was mine.

2713
01:48:50,397 --> 01:48:51,932
Who's Chanakya's biggest fan?
You right?

2714
01:48:51,965 --> 01:48:54,001
Why is he being a hero in front of them?

2715
01:48:54,001 --> 01:48:56,003
Actually, I have been planning
this for 6-7 months

2716
01:48:56,003 --> 01:48:57,271
Hey, that kerosene.

2717
01:48:58,672 --> 01:49:00,240
Hey what are you saying Madhapur?

2718
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:02,242
Tamarind Rasam, Chanakya Awesome.

2719
01:49:02,709 --> 01:49:04,811
My life is dedicated to Chanakya sir...
excuse me...

2720
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:06,747
Who the hell are you?

2721
01:49:06,747 --> 01:49:10,350
Get out, Shekhar is waiting for you,
I'll get the phone.

2722
01:49:11,185 --> 01:49:13,187
Who gave you these sunglasses,
get out of here.

2723
01:49:15,355 --> 01:49:16,890
Door. Door. Where is it?

2724
01:49:17,124 --> 01:49:20,761
Brother, I got popular
in media because of you,

2725
01:49:20,761 --> 01:49:23,096
I want to transform
my revenge into lava.

2726
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:23,597
What is that, Anna?

2727
01:49:23,664 --> 01:49:25,499
If you light a torch here, the flame should
be visible in Delhi.

2728
01:49:25,532 --> 01:49:25,966
Definitely Anna.

2729
01:49:25,999 --> 01:49:27,000
Trump should hear the sound!

2730
01:49:27,034 --> 01:49:27,568
Definitely will be heard....

2731
01:49:27,601 --> 01:49:28,302
It needs to blast!

2732
01:49:28,502 --> 01:49:29,336
Will blast, Anna

2733
01:49:29,536 --> 01:49:30,470
Then, you burn yourself....

2734
01:49:30,671 --> 01:49:31,672
Okay, I will burn...

2735
01:49:31,839 --> 01:49:34,141
-Bring him.
-What burn mys-

2736
01:49:35,943 --> 01:49:39,646
Anna, listen to me.

2737
01:49:39,813 --> 01:49:42,716
Anna, one minute
Just listen to me.

2738
01:49:42,850 --> 01:49:46,253
I think burning this car is enough
for your vengeance.

2739
01:49:46,353 --> 01:49:48,488
-It's not enough.
-Your vengeance does not have scope.

2740
01:49:48,555 --> 01:49:50,524
Shut up, will you light yourself or not?

2741
01:49:50,591 --> 01:49:52,526
I will light myself Anna

2742
01:49:53,227 --> 01:49:55,162
With the media as my witness,

2743
01:49:55,529 --> 01:49:58,465
Even if I have to sacrifice
my life for justice,

2744
01:49:58,866 --> 01:50:00,100
My burning soul...

2745
01:50:00,133 --> 01:50:02,436
mummy... mummy... Ooh... Ooh...
sir, this is not working, bro...

2746
01:50:02,436 --> 01:50:03,403
Okay. You go and torch him...

2747
01:50:03,403 --> 01:50:08,242
No... it's working... it's good...
quality carbon... matchstick... good...

2748
01:50:08,342 --> 01:50:11,345
If we wait for the national channels,
we'll have a wider reach.

2749
01:50:11,411 --> 01:50:14,381
We have Facebook, Instagram and Tik Tok.
Why don't you start?

2750
01:50:15,082 --> 01:50:17,651
Let me speak a few words
before I die.

2751
01:50:18,185 --> 01:50:19,386
This is all...

2752
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:21,855
I'm self-immolating because,

2753
01:50:22,356 --> 01:50:24,291
In our MLA Chanakya sirâ€™s case....

2754
01:50:24,491 --> 01:50:26,360
Justice has been served late,

2755
01:50:26,393 --> 01:50:26,960
Umm....

2756
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:31,965
Late.... late... late...late...late.... Justice late...
friends ... friends come very late...

2757
01:50:32,132 --> 01:50:33,767
Friends should never be late

2758
01:50:33,767 --> 01:50:35,702
People are losing lives here.

2759
01:50:35,736 --> 01:50:37,070
And for that reason.

2760
01:50:37,237 --> 01:50:41,742
my life shouldnâ€™t go to waste,
friends shouldnâ€™t come late.

2761
01:50:41,775 --> 01:50:43,177
Oh! again coined one more slogan,

2762
01:50:43,343 --> 01:50:44,211
Okay. ready, bro

2763
01:50:44,244 --> 01:50:52,653
My life shouldnâ€™t go to waste,
friends shouldnâ€™t come late.

2764
01:50:55,522 --> 01:50:56,657
Hey Srikanth

2765
01:50:56,690 --> 01:50:57,424
Huh?

2766
01:50:58,458 --> 01:51:00,427
He is a great fan of me.

2767
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:01,295
He's escaping!

2768
01:51:01,328 --> 01:51:02,229
Yes!

2769
01:51:02,262 --> 01:51:03,931
Get in quickly.

2770
01:51:03,931 --> 01:51:05,098
He will not say no to our word.

2771
01:51:05,132 --> 01:51:07,100
Letâ€™s move go, go.

2772
01:51:10,571 --> 01:51:11,805
Show me the phone.

2773
01:51:13,807 --> 01:51:15,843
I've seen this girl somewhere before.

2774
01:51:18,011 --> 01:51:19,413
The folder is also locked.

2775
01:51:19,446 --> 01:51:20,914
I saw her on TV.

2776
01:51:21,248 --> 01:51:22,916
Everything is clear now.

2777
01:51:23,717 --> 01:51:25,219
If the folder is locked,

2778
01:51:25,285 --> 01:51:27,654
Then there's definitely
some important information in there.

2779
01:51:28,689 --> 01:51:30,123
How can that be?

2780
01:51:33,927 --> 01:51:36,463
Itâ€™s him, he's calling.

2781
01:51:36,496 --> 01:51:37,030
Take the call.

2782
01:51:37,064 --> 01:51:38,532
Take the call and talk to him.
-Hey, talk bey.

2783
01:51:44,671 --> 01:51:45,439
Hello...

2784
01:51:45,439 --> 01:51:46,673
Hey..hey...hey...

2785
01:51:46,707 --> 01:51:47,207
Sir

2786
01:51:47,207 --> 01:51:48,442
Who do you think you're playing with?

2787
01:51:48,475 --> 01:51:49,510
Enough is enough.

2788
01:51:49,543 --> 01:51:50,310
Listen to me-

2789
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:51,044
Stop

2790
01:51:51,612 --> 01:51:54,081
Iâ€™ll kill you if you donâ€™t give
come and give me that phone.

2791
01:51:54,114 --> 01:51:56,850
Lousy fellow, Iâ€™ll chop you and
make a broth out of it.

2792
01:51:56,884 --> 01:51:58,151
Donâ€™t you raise your voice.

2793
01:51:58,352 --> 01:52:00,487
Do you even know whom you
are messing with?

2794
01:52:00,521 --> 01:52:01,989
Common man

2795
01:52:02,022 --> 01:52:03,624
Ey! Everyone is â€˜commonâ€™ to me.

2796
01:52:03,657 --> 01:52:05,559
You touched the complete man, Raymondâ€™s

2797
01:52:05,592 --> 01:52:06,193
Yeah

2798
01:52:06,226 --> 01:52:07,561
Do you know whom you are talking to?

2799
01:52:07,594 --> 01:52:09,429
Well, do you know whom you are talking to?

2800
01:52:09,429 --> 01:52:11,431
Itâ€™s Ladies Emporium, Srikanth...

2801
01:52:11,698 --> 01:52:14,835
All the ladies, err, I mean all the rowdies
of Jogipet, bow down to me.

2802
01:52:14,868 --> 01:52:17,604
I have bangles, err, guns in my pocket,
at any given time...

2803
01:52:17,638 --> 01:52:20,607
That day, I let you go because
I had a bad stomach.

2804
01:52:20,607 --> 01:52:21,842
But not today, come here

2805
01:52:21,842 --> 01:52:22,709
You come here

2806
01:52:22,709 --> 01:52:23,877
You come here,
Why should I?

2807
01:52:23,877 --> 01:52:24,511
To suck it.

2808
01:52:24,545 --> 01:52:26,079
You come to here.
-No you come here

2809
01:52:26,113 --> 01:52:28,348
Even if you beg on my feet,
Iâ€™ll not leave you

2810
01:52:28,382 --> 01:52:30,918
I don't touch your feet for mercy

2811
01:52:30,951 --> 01:52:32,853
You come here and

2812
01:52:32,853 --> 01:52:34,755
How many circles do people go around
Chilukuri Balaji temple?

2813
01:52:34,788 --> 01:52:37,457
111, yeah
do 111 circles here around me.

2814
01:52:37,457 --> 01:52:39,159
Damn, I am coming.

2815
01:52:40,327 --> 01:52:41,461
Stop that right now

2816
01:52:41,461 --> 01:52:42,930
Hey, donâ€™t stop me Ravi.

2817
01:52:42,963 --> 01:52:44,131
Shekar, donâ€™t stop me.

2818
01:52:44,164 --> 01:52:45,666
Heâ€™ll be done today

2819
01:52:45,699 --> 01:52:47,367
I will show you whatâ€™s on that phone.

2820
01:52:47,401 --> 01:52:48,669
Just watch how much
you'll drip down our pants.

2821
01:52:48,669 --> 01:52:50,470
Take a left here.

2822
01:52:50,504 --> 01:52:51,505
You're going to drip down your pants today.

2823
01:52:51,538 --> 01:52:53,273
Wait there, I'll be right there
-give me his phone.

2824
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:56,276
Just wait till you drip down your pants now.

2825
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:56,910
Hey, look at this.

2826
01:52:57,678 --> 01:52:58,745
Why is it dripping?

2827
01:52:59,012 --> 01:53:00,113
Arey, he did-

2828
01:53:00,647 --> 01:53:02,149
Why did you dip it in tea?

2829
01:53:02,349 --> 01:53:03,050
He wanted to take a selfie

2830
01:53:03,083 --> 01:53:04,117
Is it a biscuit or what?

2831
01:53:04,151 --> 01:53:05,853
Itâ€™s was an accident.please understand

2832
01:53:05,886 --> 01:53:07,688
It's in the next lane, take a turn.

2833
01:53:07,688 --> 01:53:09,089
Hello, do you have silk petticoats sir?

2834
01:53:09,122 --> 01:53:10,457
What petticoats?

2835
01:53:10,457 --> 01:53:11,291
Isnâ€™t it Diwakar textiles?

2836
01:53:11,358 --> 01:53:12,526
How dare you
fool around with the Prabhakar?

2837
01:53:12,559 --> 01:53:13,927
Prabhakar? Sorry sir,
I thought you were Sudhakar.

2838
01:53:13,961 --> 01:53:14,661
wrong number.

2839
01:53:18,565 --> 01:53:19,733
I didn't mean to,
it was an accident.

2840
01:53:19,766 --> 01:53:21,768
I was just taking selfie
and it vibrated all of a sudden

2841
01:53:24,238 --> 01:53:25,072
They must be around here.

2842
01:53:27,741 --> 01:53:29,710
Hey, you asked me to come

2843
01:53:29,743 --> 01:53:30,310
Here I am.

2844
01:53:30,344 --> 01:53:31,245
Where are you?
Come out

2845
01:53:31,278 --> 01:53:34,147
Damn! No value for me,
no value for my word.

2846
01:53:34,248 --> 01:53:35,482
Iâ€™ll rip you apart.

2847
01:53:35,516 --> 01:53:36,917
Hey, go find them, they must be
somewhere around here.

2848
01:53:37,951 --> 01:53:40,187
Ey, one tea
-One tea

2849
01:53:40,521 --> 01:53:43,724
More milk, less sugar,
more decoction-

2850
01:53:43,724 --> 01:53:44,057
Hmm

2851
01:53:44,091 --> 01:53:45,092
-One tea

2852
01:53:45,125 --> 01:53:47,461
Idiot, you just say â€˜teaâ€™ again.

2853
01:53:47,494 --> 01:53:50,697
Now repeat after me, more milk,
less sugar and strong decoction.

2854
01:53:50,697 --> 01:53:51,365
Say it.

2855
01:53:52,466 --> 01:53:53,133
One tea

2856
01:53:53,166 --> 01:53:54,535
You said it again!

2857
01:53:54,535 --> 01:53:56,069
Okay, we surrender.

2858
01:53:56,069 --> 01:53:57,538
Hey, just stay right there

2859
01:53:57,571 --> 01:53:59,273
Gotcha! you rats
Stay there.

2860
01:53:59,306 --> 01:54:00,674
Why are you hiding?

2861
01:54:00,707 --> 01:54:01,875
Out, come out

2862
01:54:01,909 --> 01:54:03,377
Come out in the open

2863
01:54:03,410 --> 01:54:04,178
Stay behind that line.

2864
01:54:04,178 --> 01:54:05,379
Donâ€™t cross the line.
If you do, you're out.

2865
01:54:05,379 --> 01:54:06,547
Put the gun away,
Man to Man.

2866
01:54:06,580 --> 01:54:08,282
Are you a man?

2867
01:54:08,315 --> 01:54:09,283
Why talk about it now?

2868
01:54:09,316 --> 01:54:10,350
If you have guts just stay right here.

2869
01:54:10,384 --> 01:54:10,751
Yes, Iâ€™ll stay here

2870
01:54:10,784 --> 01:54:12,186
I am not saying to you idiots you follow me

2871
01:54:12,186 --> 01:54:12,819
Hey!

2872
01:54:12,853 --> 01:54:13,554
You stay here.
-I am staying here!

2873
01:54:13,587 --> 01:54:15,322
What sort of dirty stuff
did you do in this?

2874
01:54:15,355 --> 01:54:16,456
You are done today.

2875
01:54:16,490 --> 01:54:17,925
Done!
-Donâ€™t point your fingers at me.

2876
01:54:17,958 --> 01:54:19,026
You are done if you cross the line.

2877
01:54:19,059 --> 01:54:19,893
I'll stand right here.

2878
01:54:19,927 --> 01:54:20,627
We'll be back you, just stay here

2879
01:54:20,661 --> 01:54:22,029
If you are man just stay right there.

2880
01:54:22,062 --> 01:54:23,096
Stay there. Stay there

2881
01:54:23,130 --> 01:54:23,864
Suck this!

2882
01:54:23,931 --> 01:54:25,432
Oh Mama,

2883
01:54:25,432 --> 01:54:27,334
What happened Rama?

2884
01:54:27,367 --> 01:54:29,336
What's all this drama?

2885
01:54:29,570 --> 01:54:32,039
What is this Ruckus?

2886
01:54:32,272 --> 01:54:33,240
Oh Mama,

2887
01:54:33,273 --> 01:54:35,175
What happened Rama?

2888
01:54:35,175 --> 01:54:37,144
What's all this drama?

2889
01:54:37,177 --> 01:54:39,847
What is this Ruckus?

2890
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:43,083
Arre, because life is a zindagi,

2891
01:54:47,821 --> 01:54:49,056
Silly fools,

2892
01:54:49,089 --> 01:54:50,958
Are trying to break the rules.

2893
01:54:50,991 --> 01:54:52,526
And fighting with these goons.

2894
01:54:52,559 --> 01:54:53,093
Hey, donâ€™t come close.

2895
01:54:53,126 --> 01:54:55,028
These tomatoes are hard.

2896
01:54:55,028 --> 01:54:57,831
Idiots, stop picking up the tomatoes
and get them

2897
01:54:57,865 --> 01:54:58,832
Run away from the gun

2898
01:54:58,866 --> 01:55:00,901
Go find a place my son,

2899
01:55:00,934 --> 01:55:03,504
from the hell and heaven

2900
01:55:03,570 --> 01:55:04,805
Silly fools,

2901
01:55:04,838 --> 01:55:06,707
Are trying to break the rules.

2902
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:08,642
And fighting with these goons.

2903
01:55:08,709 --> 01:55:10,978
And mountain on their spoons.

2904
01:55:11,411 --> 01:55:12,412
Run run run,

2905
01:55:12,613 --> 01:55:14,214
Run away from the gun

2906
01:55:14,248 --> 01:55:16,283
Go find a place my son,

2907
01:55:16,316 --> 01:55:18,886
from the hell and heaven

2908
01:55:20,754 --> 01:55:24,391
Mama, according to my imagination

2909
01:55:24,424 --> 01:55:25,225
if we have to be safe

2910
01:55:25,259 --> 01:55:26,126
we have to go towards the north

2911
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:27,628
Mama

2912
01:55:39,339 --> 01:55:39,940
Hey, wait a minute.

2913
01:55:39,973 --> 01:55:41,308
Please step aside, and let me go.

2914
01:55:41,441 --> 01:55:42,809
You are the girl on the phone, right?

2915
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:44,845
Of course it's you! Same face

2916
01:55:44,878 --> 01:55:46,213
No, itâ€™s not me, you are mistaken

2917
01:55:46,246 --> 01:55:47,981
Weâ€™ve been looking for you

2918
01:55:48,148 --> 01:55:48,916
Whatâ€™s on this phone?

2919
01:55:49,082 --> 01:55:50,417
Chanakyaâ€™s men are after
our lives for this.

2920
01:55:50,450 --> 01:55:52,286
Please, listen to me,
Big shots are involved in this.

2921
01:55:52,319 --> 01:55:54,288
I even had to resign from my job
as a journalist.

2922
01:55:54,321 --> 01:55:55,622
There are a lot of problems.

2923
01:55:55,656 --> 01:55:56,990
What, you want me to listen to you?

2924
01:55:57,024 --> 01:55:59,059
I know you faced
some small problems because of me.

2925
01:55:59,092 --> 01:56:00,294
Small problems?

2926
01:56:00,327 --> 01:56:01,662
They are trying to kill us.

2927
01:56:01,695 --> 01:56:02,496
You donâ€™t know.

2928
01:56:02,529 --> 01:56:03,897
I go to Sai Baba
temple every week

2929
01:56:03,931 --> 01:56:05,465
and pray for your safety.

2930
01:56:05,465 --> 01:56:05,966
What?

2931
01:56:06,133 --> 01:56:07,768
Here, listen and try to understand

2932
01:56:07,801 --> 01:56:09,002
We are in deep mess.

2933
01:56:09,036 --> 01:56:10,137
Just tell me how to unlock this folder.

2934
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:11,805
Please listen to me,

2935
01:56:11,839 --> 01:56:12,806
I donâ€™t know.

2936
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,508
Please, let me go.

2937
01:56:15,275 --> 01:56:18,779
Hey, Julie, Hey, Samantha,
what spell have you cast on us?

2938
01:56:18,946 --> 01:56:20,681
Let's not chop, let's slash.

2939
01:56:20,714 --> 01:56:23,917
Keep the frame ready,
there are no retakes.

2940
01:56:24,518 --> 01:56:26,386
Slash- Slash-

2941
01:56:28,088 --> 01:56:29,289
â€œHi, I am Preetam

2942
01:56:29,323 --> 01:56:30,858
The next episode on â€œNeralu Ghoraluâ€

2943
01:56:31,458 --> 01:56:34,728
â€œA son who brutally killed his mother.â€

2944
01:56:35,362 --> 01:56:35,929
Wait bhaiyya.

2945
01:56:35,929 --> 01:56:36,363
Sir,

2946
01:56:36,597 --> 01:56:37,264
He is a fan

2947
01:56:37,297 --> 01:56:38,732
Move, move.

2948
01:56:39,700 --> 01:56:41,001
Sir, you are...

2949
01:56:41,401 --> 01:56:43,170
I am Preetam, of â€œNeralu Ghoraluâ€

2950
01:56:43,203 --> 01:56:45,839
So, you were the one in that Jogipet episode?

2951
01:56:45,906 --> 01:56:48,775
Yes, that is how I shot to fame.

2952
01:56:58,919 --> 01:57:00,254
What even was that video?

2953
01:57:02,155 --> 01:57:04,391
How could you exaggerate it so much?

2954
01:57:05,459 --> 01:57:08,028
My life has been destroyed because of it.

2955
01:57:11,532 --> 01:57:14,668
Donâ€™t you ever show the truth?

2956
01:57:15,569 --> 01:57:17,204
Making such dumb and useless videos?

2957
01:57:17,271 --> 01:57:17,804
Yes, tell me

2958
01:57:19,306 --> 01:57:20,240
Yeah, I am coming

2959
01:57:20,908 --> 01:57:24,311
Next time if I see
such dumbass videos,

2960
01:57:24,344 --> 01:57:27,014
Iâ€™ll rip you.

2961
01:57:27,848 --> 01:57:29,049
Get lost!

2962
01:57:30,450 --> 01:57:32,019
Get lost!

2963
01:57:34,855 --> 01:57:35,923
Just wait, I will make a video
of this incident too.

2964
01:57:35,956 --> 01:57:37,925
You dumb cow!

2965
01:57:41,662 --> 01:57:43,263
Oh my,

2966
01:57:45,332 --> 01:57:49,069
It looks like they will not let us go.

2967
01:57:49,570 --> 01:57:51,772
They will kill us anyway, even if we
give them the phone or not.

2968
01:57:52,272 --> 01:57:53,106
Not really.

2969
01:57:53,540 --> 01:57:56,810
Chanakyaâ€™s life and death
secrets are in our hands,

2970
01:57:56,810 --> 01:57:58,512
weâ€™ll get out of this mess.

2971
01:58:02,549 --> 01:58:07,187
Mama, there is only one guy who can
help us out of this situation.

2972
01:58:07,721 --> 01:58:08,989
MLA Ramachandraiah

2973
01:58:09,256 --> 01:58:11,058
Why will he help us?

2974
01:58:11,058 --> 01:58:13,660
What is an enemy's enemy to us?

2975
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:15,429
Eternal Enemy!

2976
01:58:15,529 --> 01:58:17,097
He'd be a friend, dimwit.

2977
01:58:17,965 --> 01:58:19,900
I am not saying that he will help
us out of love or respect.

2978
01:58:20,334 --> 01:58:22,436
But out of hatred for Chanakya

2979
01:58:22,870 --> 01:58:24,137
They hate each other.

2980
01:58:24,204 --> 01:58:26,273
Minus plus minus? Will be a plus for us.

2981
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:28,175
I will hand this phone over to
Ramachandraiah

2982
01:58:28,208 --> 01:58:29,510
We are going to get out of this case.

2983
01:58:29,510 --> 01:58:30,410
I will make sure of it

2984
01:58:30,444 --> 01:58:31,178
That's my nature.

2985
01:58:31,378 --> 01:58:32,112
Thatâ€™s it.

2986
01:58:40,587 --> 01:58:41,788
Hey, wait.

2987
01:58:43,457 --> 01:58:44,558
Sir, we want to meet Jogipet MLA

2988
01:58:44,558 --> 01:58:45,192
Why?

2989
01:58:45,759 --> 01:58:46,493
To share our sorrows

2990
01:58:46,527 --> 01:58:47,594
What sorrows?

2991
01:58:48,161 --> 01:58:50,130
Because his grandmother
has not been receiving her pension,

2992
01:58:50,163 --> 01:58:51,932
His grandfather passed away.

2993
01:58:53,233 --> 01:58:54,701
It's a confusing situation sir,

2994
01:58:54,801 --> 01:58:55,502
Alright, go.

2995
01:58:56,069 --> 01:58:57,137
Thanks a lot, sir.

2996
01:58:58,805 --> 01:59:01,175
Sir, Jogipet MLA is not even in our party.

2997
01:59:02,109 --> 01:59:03,010
Hey, wait

2998
01:59:04,878 --> 01:59:07,481
Hey, educational ministry is downstairs,
let's get the books.

2999
01:59:07,481 --> 01:59:08,348
Letâ€™s go.

3000
01:59:09,816 --> 01:59:10,551
Mama, Ramachandraiah

3001
01:59:16,790 --> 01:59:17,758
Mama, last chance.

3002
01:59:18,659 --> 01:59:19,560
We are neck deep in trouble

3003
01:59:20,060 --> 01:59:21,261
I will count to three,

3004
01:59:21,595 --> 01:59:23,697
Letâ€™s run and break
through the door and

3005
01:59:23,730 --> 01:59:25,399
make this phone land
in Ramachandriahâ€™s hands.

3006
01:59:25,399 --> 01:59:26,533
Itâ€™s doesnâ€™t matter even if one of us dies

3007
01:59:26,567 --> 01:59:27,167
What say?

3008
01:59:27,668 --> 01:59:28,836
Swear on Jogipet,

3009
01:59:29,336 --> 01:59:33,106
On my count, 1, 2, 3...

3010
01:59:38,679 --> 01:59:39,513
Don't you have any trust?

3011
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:41,582
Shameless cheaters.

3012
01:59:42,916 --> 01:59:44,384
What happened?
Why are you gawking like that?

3013
01:59:44,418 --> 01:59:46,687
Alright, letâ€™s all go together.

3014
01:59:47,087 --> 01:59:49,489
Just divert that bodyguard and

3015
01:59:49,489 --> 01:59:50,357
I will manage the rest.

3016
01:59:50,457 --> 01:59:51,291
Letâ€™s go.

3017
01:59:51,825 --> 01:59:53,493
Walk

3018
01:59:53,594 --> 01:59:54,461
Walk!

3019
01:59:55,762 --> 01:59:57,197
Donâ€™t get scared seeing that gun.

3020
01:59:57,231 --> 01:59:58,298
I am there for you.

3021
02:00:00,367 --> 02:00:04,471
Anna, is this Mr Ramachandraiahâ€™s office?

3022
02:00:04,505 --> 02:00:05,472
Who are they, sir?

3023
02:00:05,572 --> 02:00:06,306
From our party?

3024
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:06,807
Hey,

3025
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:08,442
who are you?

3026
02:00:09,009 --> 02:00:10,310
is that a gun in your Pocket?

3027
02:00:10,344 --> 02:00:11,812
What gun?

3028
02:00:11,812 --> 02:00:13,480
Are you here to murder Ramachandraiah?

3029
02:00:13,614 --> 02:00:15,048
Get them!

3030
02:00:15,082 --> 02:00:16,350
Security get them

3031
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:17,050
Run! Run!

3032
02:00:17,084 --> 02:00:17,651
Stop them

3033
02:00:21,855 --> 02:00:22,990
Sir, gross injustice has been done to me.

3034
02:00:23,190 --> 02:00:24,324
You have to take some action.

3035
02:00:27,661 --> 02:00:28,662
Sir, Sir, I donâ€™t know anything.

3036
02:00:28,695 --> 02:00:29,963
But Chanakyaâ€™s men are after my life.

3037
02:00:29,997 --> 02:00:30,697
Sir, Iâ€™ll tell you the truth

3038
02:00:30,731 --> 02:00:32,299
Sir, I donâ€™t know what it is,
but there is a video on that phone.

3039
02:00:32,332 --> 02:00:33,000
You can check, sir

3040
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:33,600
who are those two

3041
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:36,136
I donâ€™t know anything, sir,
I am innocent sir. Kill them both sir.

3042
02:00:36,170 --> 02:00:37,337
Please check the phone, please, please.

3043
02:00:37,371 --> 02:00:37,938
Please.. please

3044
02:00:38,472 --> 02:00:40,007
please leave me

3045
02:00:48,815 --> 02:00:50,817
Its open now, check it

3046
02:01:07,201 --> 02:01:10,571
That Chanakya! and this video!

3047
02:01:10,804 --> 02:01:13,941
With this video, Chanakyaâ€™s life,

3048
02:01:14,007 --> 02:01:14,708
will it get squashed?

3049
02:01:14,741 --> 02:01:16,109
Our lives are in a mess, sir.

3050
02:01:16,143 --> 02:01:17,578
Your life is all set.

3051
02:01:17,611 --> 02:01:19,146
Be happy.

3052
02:01:19,179 --> 02:01:21,782
Thank you sir.

3053
02:01:21,815 --> 02:01:25,886
You helped not only me
but the entire nation.

3054
02:01:25,919 --> 02:01:26,320
Yes!

3055
02:01:29,423 --> 02:01:31,291
You are precious gems!

3056
02:01:31,358 --> 02:01:32,392
Thank you, sir, thank you...

3057
02:01:32,426 --> 02:01:34,661
You came right place at the right time.

3058
02:01:34,795 --> 02:01:36,196
Sir, you have power in your hands

3059
02:01:36,230 --> 02:01:37,030
We have brains.

3060
02:01:37,064 --> 02:01:37,898
If we join hands...

3061
02:01:38,432 --> 02:01:39,967
Does that mean I have no brains?

3062
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:41,702
No, sir, I mean we have no power.

3063
02:01:41,768 --> 02:01:42,269
yes...

3064
02:01:42,469 --> 02:01:43,270
Then its..okay...

3065
02:01:43,303 --> 02:01:45,272
Then, it's fine.

3066
02:01:47,341 --> 02:01:49,376
Sir, the thing is...

3067
02:01:49,443 --> 02:01:51,778
It's okay. Tell me, what is it?

3068
02:01:52,779 --> 02:01:54,915
I have to pay my daughter's school fees.

3069
02:01:54,982 --> 02:01:57,618
Otherwise, they will not allow her
to attend the exams.

3070
02:01:57,684 --> 02:01:59,987
I have not received my salary
for three months.

3071
02:02:01,054 --> 02:02:03,023
Don't think of it as a salary.

3072
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:04,858
-Please go, Mr. Chalapati Rao.
-Sir.

3073
02:02:04,958 --> 02:02:06,159
I'll arrange it.

3074
02:02:10,697 --> 02:02:12,499
Please call JP real estate.

3075
02:02:13,667 --> 02:02:16,303
Give that money to these workers.

3076
02:02:17,604 --> 02:02:18,639
Okay, sir.

3077
02:02:29,016 --> 02:02:30,484
Please forgive me, father.

3078
02:02:32,452 --> 02:02:33,520
Sensational news!

3079
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:35,656
Mr Ramachandraiah,
who has never come before the media,

3080
02:02:35,689 --> 02:02:38,158
is here to talk to us about Mr. Chanakya

3081
02:02:38,158 --> 02:02:42,095
Today, I am holding this press meet to
talk about a few important issues.

3082
02:02:42,129 --> 02:02:44,398
Chanakya is dead now.

3083
02:02:44,798 --> 02:02:48,268
Everyone knows that I speak
the truth and nothing else.

3084
02:02:48,635 --> 02:02:49,570
Brother!

3085
02:02:50,237 --> 02:02:52,406
My brother!

3086
02:02:53,006 --> 02:02:55,609
Ramachandriah, Chanakya
are like brothers.

3087
02:02:56,143 --> 02:02:58,078
We do have differences.

3088
02:02:58,345 --> 02:02:59,079
That is true.

3089
02:02:59,112 --> 02:03:01,915
But thatâ€™s only when it comes
to serving society.

3090
02:03:01,982 --> 02:03:03,550
What on earth did he do!

3091
02:03:03,584 --> 02:03:04,818
Sir, you are known bitter rivals,

3092
02:03:04,852 --> 02:03:06,420
but why are you allies now?

3093
02:03:06,453 --> 02:03:08,255
Look
-I will answer it

3094
02:03:08,622 --> 02:03:09,289
Okay

3095
02:03:09,289 --> 02:03:14,361
We knew you'd ask us this question
when we become allies.

3096
02:03:14,361 --> 02:03:15,762
We had to become allies
some time or the other,

3097
02:03:15,796 --> 02:03:16,430
We became allies today

3098
02:03:16,997 --> 02:03:20,734
I love you brother
-I love you too.

3099
02:03:28,909 --> 02:03:29,910
What is this?

3100
02:03:29,910 --> 02:03:31,478
Not now, later, please.

3101
02:03:31,478 --> 02:03:32,880
What is this?

3102
02:03:32,913 --> 02:03:34,515
How are you allies with Ramachandriah?

3103
02:03:34,548 --> 02:03:35,449
Hey

3104
02:03:36,216 --> 02:03:38,685
Those three handed
my phone over to Ramachandraiah

3105
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:39,119
Yeah, so?

3106
02:03:40,454 --> 02:03:42,523
To prevent the video coming put,

3107
02:03:42,556 --> 02:03:45,859
I had to give him 100 crores
out of the 500 I got.

3108
02:03:45,859 --> 02:03:47,027
I had to compromise.

3109
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:48,729
So,We lost 100 crores?

3110
02:03:48,729 --> 02:03:55,035
For the video not to come out,
we have to lose 100 crores.

3111
02:03:55,235 --> 02:03:58,305
Otherwise, all my political career is over.

3112
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:00,607
Okay, but tell me now.

3113
02:04:00,607 --> 02:04:02,676
What's on that phone?

3114
02:04:15,622 --> 02:04:16,723
Hello,

3115
02:04:17,424 --> 02:04:18,559
All good sir?

3116
02:04:18,592 --> 02:04:21,828
Hey, all this while I thought you
three were naive.

3117
02:04:21,828 --> 02:04:24,698
I felt guilty for getting you
stuck in middle of this

3118
02:04:24,731 --> 02:04:25,899
So you're not feeling guilty any more?

3119
02:04:25,899 --> 02:04:29,036
How dare you to give my phone
to Ramachandraiah?

3120
02:04:29,069 --> 02:04:30,871
No sir, it happened by mistake.

3121
02:04:30,938 --> 02:04:32,773
We were supposed to give it to you sir

3122
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:34,975
I will show who is Chanakya
tomorrow in the court

3123
02:04:35,008 --> 02:04:36,577
Sir,Sir please, sir...sir

3124
02:04:37,077 --> 02:04:39,913
Tomorrow, your life is closed

3125
02:04:53,927 --> 02:04:56,697
The verdict for MLA Chanakya's murder attempt

3126
02:04:56,730 --> 02:04:58,665
is to be given today.

3127
02:04:58,832 --> 02:05:02,836
Let's watch the proceedings of the court.

3128
02:05:10,277 --> 02:05:11,445
Not her again.

3129
02:05:12,079 --> 02:05:13,080
Good Morning, your honor

3130
02:05:13,313 --> 02:05:15,382
So which movie did you watch this time?

3131
02:05:15,415 --> 02:05:17,017
Come to the point, your honor

3132
02:05:17,084 --> 02:05:19,286
These three innocent men,

3133
02:05:19,286 --> 02:05:21,655
Have been trapped in a big case,

3134
02:05:21,655 --> 02:05:23,156
Because they're from
a small town and

3135
02:05:23,156 --> 02:05:25,425
can't do anything.

3136
02:05:26,093 --> 02:05:27,327
But there's more to the truth.

3137
02:05:28,161 --> 02:05:31,798
If you permit, Iâ€™d like to ask Mr Chanakya,
a few questions.

3138
02:05:34,902 --> 02:05:37,271
Mr Chankaya, do you drink?

3139
02:05:39,706 --> 02:05:41,308
Itâ€™s okay, you can speak without hesitation.

3140
02:05:41,608 --> 02:05:42,976
Our judge drinks as well.

3141
02:05:44,645 --> 02:05:46,280
Alright, letâ€™s come to the point

3142
02:05:46,346 --> 02:05:48,849
You And Ramachandraiah together made a scam

3143
02:05:48,849 --> 02:05:50,083
that video was recorded on the phone

3144
02:05:50,184 --> 02:05:51,818
That phone has this secret recorded.

3145
02:05:52,352 --> 02:05:55,088
Isn't that why you created this drama
and hid the phone?

3146
02:05:55,322 --> 02:05:56,056
I did not hide it

3147
02:05:56,056 --> 02:05:56,723
You hid it

3148
02:05:56,757 --> 02:05:57,291
I did not hide it

3149
02:05:57,324 --> 02:05:57,958
You hid it

3150
02:05:57,958 --> 02:05:58,358
I did not hide it

3151
02:05:58,492 --> 02:05:59,626
You hid it I didn't

3152
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:00,260
You didnâ€™t hide it

3153
02:06:00,294 --> 02:06:01,128
Yes, that is what I have been saying

3154
02:06:01,929 --> 02:06:03,797
Exactly, your honor

3155
02:06:03,830 --> 02:06:06,200
Usually, according to human psychology,

3156
02:06:06,233 --> 02:06:09,102
When I said â€œYou did not hideâ€

3157
02:06:09,503 --> 02:06:11,605
But he still said that he did not hide it.

3158
02:06:12,272 --> 02:06:16,009
So, you can imagine how strongly
he has made up his mind to lie.

3159
02:06:16,043 --> 02:06:17,177
Just think about it

3160
02:06:18,478 --> 02:06:19,513
Objection, your honor

3161
02:06:19,813 --> 02:06:23,517
Lawyer Shamili is playing games,

3162
02:06:23,517 --> 02:06:25,719
and confusing my client Chanakya

3163
02:06:25,752 --> 02:06:26,320
Itâ€™s not correct

3164
02:06:26,854 --> 02:06:30,490
She is exploiting my client's innocence

3165
02:06:30,724 --> 02:06:31,792
Your honor,

3166
02:06:31,792 --> 02:06:35,495
Lawyer Shamili is repeatedly
affirming that these three are innocent.

3167
02:06:35,896 --> 02:06:38,398
If you permit, Iâ€™d like to present
a video to you

3168
02:06:38,599 --> 02:06:39,700
â€œHey, whatâ€™s this?

3169
02:06:39,967 --> 02:06:42,503
What are you serving to the public?

3170
02:06:42,603 --> 02:06:44,271
I will kill you.

3171
02:06:45,639 --> 02:06:47,975
Do you see how violent their behaviour is,
your Honor?

3172
02:06:48,375 --> 02:06:53,480
Therefore, I request the court to find them
guilty of the crime.

3173
02:06:54,915 --> 02:06:58,619
Is there anything you want to say
for the last time?

3174
02:06:59,186 --> 02:06:59,853
Hey,

3175
02:06:59,987 --> 02:07:03,023
Only you eat ladies finger in our group and
your imagination is excellent.

3176
02:07:03,056 --> 02:07:03,824
Go and speak...go...

3177
02:07:03,857 --> 02:07:06,793
Will you say something or
simply talk amongst yourselves?

3178
02:07:06,793 --> 02:07:08,495
Hey, what can I speak?

3179
02:07:08,529 --> 02:07:09,796
Your honor...

3180
02:07:13,767 --> 02:07:15,002
Namaste, sir

3181
02:07:21,842 --> 02:07:26,547
Can you replay the CCTV footage
shown by the lawyer?

3182
02:07:36,723 --> 02:07:38,058
Pause there, sir.

3183
02:07:41,128 --> 02:07:45,966
Can you see Chanakya, his brother
and a third person there?

3184
02:07:48,335 --> 02:07:50,737
He is a Hong Kong businessman, sir

3185
02:07:51,872 --> 02:07:55,209
How can you certify that
he is from Hong Kong?

3186
02:07:55,542 --> 02:07:58,212
Sir, I watch Jackie Chan movies,
without subtitles.

3187
02:07:58,245 --> 02:08:00,113
If they are from China,
I can easily confirm

3188
02:08:00,347 --> 02:08:02,082
He is from Hong Kong

3189
02:08:02,716 --> 02:08:04,484
Just a minute, sir,

3190
02:08:04,518 --> 02:08:05,519
Donâ€™t get involved.

3191
02:08:05,786 --> 02:08:06,353
Correct

3192
02:08:06,687 --> 02:08:10,257
That night, Chanakya, his brother
and the Hong Kong businessman were,

3193
02:08:10,724 --> 02:08:15,329
discussing something seriously about hotels
and entered a room.

3194
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:18,599
It was a birthday so,

3195
02:08:18,765 --> 02:08:19,867
Why would they be serious?

3196
02:08:20,601 --> 02:08:21,935
They entered the room laughing,

3197
02:08:25,739 --> 02:08:27,975
As soon as they entered,
first the brother sat,

3198
02:08:29,176 --> 02:08:31,578
wait, why would the brother
sit before Chanakya did,

3199
02:08:31,912 --> 02:08:34,448
Chanakya sat and then the brother.

3200
02:08:34,748 --> 02:08:37,851
After that, they were
in a serious discussion.

3201
02:08:38,218 --> 02:08:42,523
Hotels, shares, profit, loss and
many other secrets.

3202
02:08:42,689 --> 02:08:45,826
Suddenly the Hong Kong businessman
got furious and started talking in Chinese

3203
02:08:45,859 --> 02:08:50,430
Speaks Gibberish

3204
02:08:53,467 --> 02:08:55,469
What a big statement he made.

3205
02:08:55,736 --> 02:08:56,937
We donâ€™t understand Chinese

3206
02:08:56,937 --> 02:08:57,738
Translate it in Telugu for us.

3207
02:08:58,505 --> 02:08:59,339
Sorry, sir

3208
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:05,145
He said strongly,â€

3209
02:09:05,179 --> 02:09:09,216
This is when Chanakyaâ€™s brother got some
'suspentation'

3210
02:09:09,249 --> 02:09:11,718
Brother, what about my share of profits?

3211
02:09:12,152 --> 02:09:16,256
Chanakya and the Hong Kong businessman
together made him a scapegoat.

3212
02:09:16,957 --> 02:09:21,895
I said, â€œYou take 50% share, I take 50% share
and you will take the remaining 0%â€

3213
02:09:22,796 --> 02:09:25,732
Chanakya's brother
got angry,

3214
02:09:26,333 --> 02:09:29,503
took a gun out of his pocket
and fired some shots.

3215
02:09:31,839 --> 02:09:33,740
That is when a girl arrived at the party.

3216
02:09:33,774 --> 02:09:35,809
She must've recorded the whole thing
on her phone.

3217
02:09:36,443 --> 02:09:41,415
Correct! From then on, they went after
the girl and the phone.

3218
02:09:44,184 --> 02:09:44,918
This is too much.

3219
02:09:44,952 --> 02:09:47,754
Their imagination and storytelling
is beyond this world.

3220
02:09:48,288 --> 02:09:51,358
All these imaginations and ladies fingers
wonâ€™t work here in the court.

3221
02:09:51,725 --> 02:09:53,527
Tell me if you have strong evidence.

3222
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:54,561
Evidences,

3223
02:09:56,730 --> 02:09:59,566
This reminds me of a poem from
Mahabharata that I learnt.

3224
02:10:00,467 --> 02:10:02,469
'Karmanye vaadika rasyam'

3225
02:10:02,703 --> 02:10:05,639
Chankyam- innocent-um accused-um!

3226
02:10:06,406 --> 02:10:07,107
Huh!

3227
02:10:07,608 --> 02:10:09,142
What is happening here?

3228
02:10:09,443 --> 02:10:11,912
Your honor, I donâ€™t understand
what he's saying

3229
02:10:11,979 --> 02:10:13,580
I donâ€™t understand either.

3230
02:10:14,214 --> 02:10:16,917
I can't even understand
why we came to Hyderabad in the first place

3231
02:10:16,950 --> 02:10:19,019
She doesnâ€™t know
why she became a lawyer.

3232
02:10:19,186 --> 02:10:20,721
You donâ€™t know why you became a judge-

3233
02:10:20,954 --> 02:10:22,089
Sir, I know itâ€™s personal.

3234
02:10:22,122 --> 02:10:23,757
I mean a lot of things happen without a plan.

3235
02:10:24,558 --> 02:10:25,926
I want to ask the court, sir

3236
02:10:26,894 --> 02:10:28,328
Where are we headed?

3237
02:10:29,096 --> 02:10:30,797
Hello, blue shirt, yes you.

3238
02:10:33,133 --> 02:10:35,102
Hello, look my eye to eye

3239
02:10:35,769 --> 02:10:37,404
I am asking you,
where are we are headed?

3240
02:10:38,405 --> 02:10:42,709
We live in a world where everyone has
passwords for WiFi.

3241
02:10:43,744 --> 02:10:47,080
If anyone wants to use WiFi outside
anyone's house, we need passwords

3242
02:10:47,481 --> 02:10:52,686
How can a society which doesnâ€™t share
passwords understand our problems?

3243
02:10:55,155 --> 02:11:00,427
I get goose pimples when I think
of the problems in our society.

3244
02:11:00,627 --> 02:11:03,630
When I think of goose pimples,
I get more goose pimples.

3245
02:11:03,664 --> 02:11:06,733
Corruption, pollution,

3246
02:11:06,767 --> 02:11:10,137
population, picturization,
global warmation, is everywhere.

3247
02:11:10,871 --> 02:11:13,373
Do even know what global warmation is?

3248
02:11:13,407 --> 02:11:15,442
Mr.Defense lawyer, Mr Somashekar,

3249
02:11:15,442 --> 02:11:16,610
My name is not Somashekar.

3250
02:11:16,844 --> 02:11:17,978
Did you hear that Mr. Dwarakaprasad?

3251
02:11:18,011 --> 02:11:19,313
Dwarakaparasad, who's he?

3252
02:11:19,346 --> 02:11:20,848
Just tell me one thing sir

3253
02:11:20,881 --> 02:11:24,952
Donâ€™t you know all this drama is staged
by Hong Kong businessman and Chanakya?

3254
02:11:24,952 --> 02:11:26,787
Yes, I know...err...I donâ€™t know.

3255
02:11:28,088 --> 02:11:30,190
I am Jogipet, B.Tech topper, sir

3256
02:11:30,624 --> 02:11:34,161
41%, in the second attempt.

3257
02:11:34,728 --> 02:11:37,197
If this is the situation of
a B.Tech pass out...

3258
02:11:37,231 --> 02:11:39,633
Imagine the situation of these two 10th failures?

3259
02:11:39,766 --> 02:11:42,135
Hey, Ravi and Shekar donâ€™t be ashamed,
look at me.

3260
02:11:42,236 --> 02:11:46,373
Hello, media, cover them and
show them to the public

3261
02:11:46,673 --> 02:11:49,643
Your honor, in Jogipet, Sangareddy, the whole world,

3262
02:11:49,676 --> 02:11:52,513
Do you know how many
young people are unemployed

3263
02:11:52,546 --> 02:11:52,913
Tell me...

3264
02:11:52,946 --> 02:11:54,047
Thatâ€™s not my job

3265
02:11:58,385 --> 02:12:01,021
At times, I wonder why I was born?

3266
02:12:02,422 --> 02:12:05,459
We came here because we were
never respected in Jogipet.

3267
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:09,530
And people fly off to America because
they are not well respected here.

3268
02:12:09,830 --> 02:12:11,665
Next, will they go to the moon?

3269
02:12:12,299 --> 02:12:15,569
If this goes on, where is
Final Destination, Part 3, sir?

3270
02:12:16,203 --> 02:12:18,572
Isnâ€™t it why you are not doing
the investigation well?

3271
02:12:19,439 --> 02:12:22,209
Because we are from Jogipet and
they are from Hong Kong.

3272
02:12:23,043 --> 02:12:23,911
Isn't that it sir?

3273
02:12:24,511 --> 02:12:26,079
We are 'not have people'
they are 'have people'.

3274
02:12:26,747 --> 02:12:28,749
Canâ€™t the 'haves' and 'not haves'
survive in one place?

3275
02:12:28,782 --> 02:12:29,716
But you are together.

3276
02:12:29,750 --> 02:12:30,951
True, but we are 'not haves'

3277
02:12:30,984 --> 02:12:33,587
'Haves and 'not haves'
are all one in the court.

3278
02:12:33,587 --> 02:12:34,454
Why not sir?

3279
02:12:34,488 --> 02:12:35,822
In this court, as you can see there
are only 'haves'

3280
02:12:35,856 --> 02:12:36,490
What about the 'not haves'

3281
02:12:36,523 --> 02:12:36,823
But you have no?

3282
02:12:36,857 --> 02:12:38,959
See sir, no value for people like us.

3283
02:12:38,992 --> 02:12:39,660
This is ridiculous!

3284
02:12:39,693 --> 02:12:40,794
Are you saying, yes or no?

3285
02:12:40,794 --> 02:12:41,962
Yes, I am saying No

3286
02:12:41,995 --> 02:12:42,829
How can you say no?

3287
02:12:42,829 --> 02:12:43,897
No, I am saying yes.

3288
02:12:43,897 --> 02:12:44,798
How can you say yes?

3289
02:12:44,831 --> 02:12:47,301
Why not? Basically, maybe, generally,
yours sincerely

3290
02:12:47,334 --> 02:12:49,336
Your honor, he is wasting
the courtâ€™s prime time.

3291
02:12:49,369 --> 02:12:50,838
I am also aware of Prime,

3292
02:12:50,904 --> 02:12:51,972
and Netflix

3293
02:12:52,005 --> 02:12:54,775
and not even downloaded one
movie of Jackie Chan, sir

3294
02:12:54,808 --> 02:12:57,644
Hong Kong connection of
Chanakya to be investigated

3295
02:12:57,644 --> 02:12:59,780
by the Indian Constitution Sir,

3296
02:13:05,285 --> 02:13:07,855
Even after all this, if
you fail to understand,

3297
02:13:08,288 --> 02:13:12,459
just get the hell
and heaven, sir.

3298
02:13:16,630 --> 02:13:23,136
Hell and heaven

3299
02:13:34,114 --> 02:13:34,815
Hey, sit down

3300
02:13:54,868 --> 02:13:58,438
Mr.Subramanyam, who was that
Hong Kong delegate?

3301
02:13:58,472 --> 02:13:59,907
Chanakya, come here

3302
02:14:01,508 --> 02:14:03,477
Who was that Hong Kong guy?

3303
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:05,212
Hong Kong my foot.

3304
02:14:05,245 --> 02:14:06,613
He makes noodles,

3305
02:14:06,647 --> 02:14:08,315
Him and his dumb imagination.

3306
02:14:12,553 --> 02:14:13,353
Please tell me the truth

3307
02:14:13,387 --> 02:14:15,055
Never hide anything from
a doctor and a lawyer.

3308
02:14:15,088 --> 02:14:16,089
It is Noodles.

3309
02:14:22,696 --> 02:14:24,164
Noodles, your honor...

3310
02:14:24,198 --> 02:14:25,199
Noodles?
-Hong Kong noodles

3311
02:14:26,133 --> 02:14:28,669
He is a chef who makes noodles.

3312
02:14:28,702 --> 02:14:30,671
Sir, we had a fight that he didnâ€™t
put enough sauce in the noodles.

3313
02:14:30,737 --> 02:14:31,505
Where is the sauce?

3314
02:14:31,505 --> 02:14:32,973
Whom are you pointing
your finger at shithead?

3315
02:14:36,777 --> 02:14:39,713
Sir, is this even Balwant Choudhary's court?

3316
02:14:39,746 --> 02:14:41,582
What do they think of you, sir?

3317
02:14:45,018 --> 02:14:46,353
Stop it.

3318
02:14:46,353 --> 02:14:47,688
He didnâ€™t say that.

3319
02:14:47,688 --> 02:14:48,622
But I can feel it.

3320
02:14:49,056 --> 02:14:51,758
You might not feel it, because
of your modesty.

3321
02:15:00,634 --> 02:15:03,470
Court is ordering the police
Department to investigate the

3322
02:15:03,504 --> 02:15:06,173
relation between Chanakya
and the Hongkong businessman.

3323
02:15:06,206 --> 02:15:10,611
The high command is to form a new
committee named Operation Noodles.

3324
02:15:10,644 --> 02:15:13,080
#ByeBye to Swiss, #HiHi to Hong Kong

3325
02:15:13,113 --> 02:15:15,449
While youth in our country
is unemployed and dejected;

3326
02:15:15,449 --> 02:15:19,052
The ruling party is busy investing
in Hong Kong.

3327
02:15:19,086 --> 02:15:22,689
All youth in country are showing
their resentment against the scam

3328
02:15:25,292 --> 02:15:27,761
How can you simply hide a big scam
under the guise of 'noodles', sir?

3329
02:15:27,794 --> 02:15:29,229
Trust me, it was about the noodles.

3330
02:15:30,764 --> 02:15:32,799
After all that happened,
you still say noodles?

3331
02:15:32,833 --> 02:15:33,166
Yes.

3332
02:15:33,166 --> 02:15:34,368
You can at leas lie prop-

3333
02:15:34,368 --> 02:15:36,370
It's the truth sir!

3334
02:15:39,706 --> 02:15:40,908
What?

3335
02:15:40,941 --> 02:15:42,876
Why are you going to Hong Kong, sir?

3336
02:15:42,910 --> 02:15:44,278
I am going to Vizag.

3337
02:15:44,278 --> 02:15:45,412
To attend my granddaughter's wedding.

3338
02:15:45,412 --> 02:15:47,614
So, how will go to Hong Kong
from Vizag, sir?

3339
02:15:48,849 --> 02:15:50,150
Sir...sir...sir

3340
02:15:50,184 --> 02:15:52,619
In the past, it was the British,
and now itâ€™s the Chinese.

3341
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:54,922
The government is behind the scam.

3342
02:15:55,088 --> 02:15:56,356
Hey, don't hit him.

3343
02:16:00,894 --> 02:16:02,296
What's actually in the phone?

3344
02:16:03,096 --> 02:16:04,498
Excuse me, journalist lady.

3345
02:16:04,498 --> 02:16:06,200
Give me your phone for a minute.

3346
02:16:06,233 --> 02:16:07,201
Why sir?

3347
02:16:07,201 --> 02:16:08,468
I want to call my mother

3348
02:16:08,502 --> 02:16:09,670
But I have to go urgently.

3349
02:16:09,703 --> 02:16:10,470
Iâ€™ll give it back

3350
02:16:10,504 --> 02:16:11,205
Sir, there is nothing on my phone.

3351
02:16:11,238 --> 02:16:13,006
Then give me your phone.

3352
02:16:13,373 --> 02:16:13,841
Give the Phone

3353
02:16:14,541 --> 02:16:16,610
You think you can blackmail me
with that video?

3354
02:16:16,677 --> 02:16:17,377
Go.

3355
02:16:17,411 --> 02:16:18,412
Get out.

3356
02:16:19,279 --> 02:16:20,180
Hey

3357
02:16:20,581 --> 02:16:23,183
Give me my phone back
- You'll fire it.

3358
02:16:25,586 --> 02:16:27,020
Just leave it

3359
02:16:27,054 --> 02:16:28,722
Give me my phone.

3360
02:16:43,070 --> 02:16:44,938
The Jana Balam party
leader is enjoying himself

3361
02:16:44,972 --> 02:16:47,207
while eating Hong Kong noodles.

3362
02:16:47,241 --> 02:16:50,777
Iâ€™ve seen many kinds of people in
my 40 years of a political career.

3363
02:16:51,044 --> 02:16:52,579
But who's this guys?

3364
02:16:54,748 --> 02:16:58,185
This one video is enough to crash
our party and for by-elections to follow.

3365
02:16:58,218 --> 02:16:59,653
What is this â€˜Hong Kong dramaâ€™?

3366
02:16:59,653 --> 02:17:00,287
Trust me, sir

3367
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:03,757
I swear, that guy just makes noodles.

3368
02:17:04,558 --> 02:17:05,959
Those Hong Kong guys have landed
in Hyderabad.

3369
02:17:05,993 --> 02:17:07,995
Iâ€™ve booked AC hotel rooms for them.
-Hong Kong?

3370
02:17:07,995 --> 02:17:09,596
What about it?

3371
02:17:09,630 --> 02:17:14,101
Itâ€™s a contract of AC and electronics.
Itâ€™s a good fat deal.

3372
02:17:14,134 --> 02:17:16,670
We can use that money as
a party fund so I agreed to it.

3373
02:17:16,670 --> 02:17:17,971
Chanakya, what are you talking about?

3374
02:17:18,005 --> 02:17:20,307
If this spreads to the media,
our party will fall apart

3375
02:17:21,074 --> 02:17:23,677
Take the case back immediately and close it.

3376
02:17:24,378 --> 02:17:27,948
Sorry, sir, I wonâ€™t leave them.

3377
02:17:27,948 --> 02:17:29,550
Well then, you can leave this party.

3378
02:17:29,583 --> 02:17:30,317
What?

3379
02:17:30,317 --> 02:17:30,751
Yes!

3380
02:17:30,784 --> 02:17:32,920
The special dish on our
cooking show today is,

3381
02:17:32,953 --> 02:17:36,023
Hong Kong noodles.

3382
02:17:36,023 --> 02:17:37,090
Rascal

3383
02:17:37,090 --> 02:17:41,261
Not another word about â€œHong Kongâ€

3384
02:17:45,399 --> 02:17:47,534
After examining MLA,
Mr Chanakyaâ€™s case,

3385
02:17:47,634 --> 02:17:53,974
it is found that Chankay's fan
guilty of the murder.

3386
02:17:54,007 --> 02:17:56,176
He has been sentenced to six months
of imprisonment.

3387
02:17:56,210 --> 02:18:00,848
Srikanth, Ravi and Shekar are proved not
guilty of the crime and thus released.

3388
02:18:00,881 --> 02:18:02,449
This is my final verdict.

3389
02:18:04,885 --> 02:18:06,386
But I still suspect them.

3390
02:18:15,128 --> 02:18:16,997
Chitti...Sri...

3391
02:18:17,030 --> 02:18:19,566
So, should I book the function hall?

3392
02:18:20,267 --> 02:18:22,402
Chitti, you fought his case,
itâ€™s over now.

3393
02:18:22,436 --> 02:18:24,137
You have nothing more to do
with this guy, letâ€™s go.

3394
02:18:24,137 --> 02:18:26,807
Dad, I have something to say

3395
02:18:26,840 --> 02:18:31,445
I fell for Srikanthâ€™s innocence.

3396
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:35,115
Decide whether you want him or me?

3397
02:18:35,182 --> 02:18:36,550
Dad...

3398
02:18:36,650 --> 02:18:38,785
Donâ€™t tell me that you want both of us.

3399
02:18:39,219 --> 02:18:40,354
No, dad...

3400
02:18:40,387 --> 02:18:41,488
I want Srikanth!

3401
02:18:41,488 --> 02:18:44,157
I'm also a decent Citizen Kane like you uncle.

3402
02:18:44,191 --> 02:18:45,225
See, look into my eyes.

3403
02:18:45,225 --> 02:18:46,960
Is there any kind of trait that
I share with those criminals?

3404
02:18:46,994 --> 02:18:48,395
Guess, who it is?

3405
02:18:48,428 --> 02:18:50,531
IAS officer, Mr Murthy

3406
02:18:50,631 --> 02:18:52,466
-Hello, Suvarna.-Ravi.

3407
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:55,102
You want to meet me, right?
I'm ready now.

3408
02:18:55,235 --> 02:18:58,272
What do you mean?
I'm meeting my fiancÃ©.

3409
02:18:58,539 --> 02:19:00,674
My wedding is on the 10th of next month.

3410
02:19:01,208 --> 02:19:03,177
-Is this a joke?-No at all.

3411
02:19:03,243 --> 02:19:06,613
Please come without fail.
They will serve foreign brand alcohol.

3412
02:19:08,849 --> 02:19:10,417
-Give me a Poori.
-Crap!

3413
02:19:10,817 --> 02:19:12,252
Why are you afraid?

3414
02:19:12,286 --> 02:19:13,287
Chitti's dad.

3415
02:19:14,821 --> 02:19:15,822
Hey! Uncle.

3416
02:19:15,923 --> 02:19:16,924
Ew, no.

3417
02:19:16,957 --> 02:19:17,791
Get away.

3418
02:19:17,858 --> 02:19:19,493
Why do you look so young?
Is it a child marriage?

3419
02:19:19,526 --> 02:19:20,727
It's a joke uncle.

3420
02:19:20,761 --> 02:19:23,430
Your Chitti and our Srikanth, we're one big family.

3421
02:19:23,430 --> 02:19:25,332
Please don't count us as one

3422
02:19:25,732 --> 02:19:26,733
Take him away.

3423
02:19:28,969 --> 02:19:30,871
I'll take care of the wedding.

3424
02:19:30,871 --> 02:19:33,273
I'm inviting a tleast a
100 prisoners as guests.

3425
02:19:33,307 --> 02:19:34,908
We are one, all are one.

3426
02:19:34,975 --> 02:19:37,044
Don't let him out till we get married.

3427
02:19:37,044 --> 02:19:38,011
Sir, I don't know anything.

3428
02:19:38,011 --> 02:19:39,012
Chitti get in,

3429
02:19:39,046 --> 02:19:40,047
Sir please sir.

3430
02:19:40,113 --> 02:19:41,248
I'll kill myself.

3431
02:19:41,315 --> 02:19:41,949
Kill yourself.

3432
02:19:41,982 --> 02:19:43,450
Fine take her, but over my dead body.

3433
02:19:43,684 --> 02:19:45,118
I don't care if I die also.

3434
02:19:45,118 --> 02:19:46,520
Run over me, come.

3435
02:19:46,620 --> 02:19:48,555
Hey, not reverse, come ahead.

3436
02:19:57,130 --> 02:19:58,332
Is it nice?

3437
02:20:00,367 --> 02:20:03,203
Daddy, Where are those facebok
120 likes bangle?

3438
02:20:03,237 --> 02:20:04,104
Those shiny ones.

3439
02:20:04,137 --> 02:20:07,241
What happened?
why are you looking at me like that?

3440
02:20:07,274 --> 02:20:08,275
What is that?

3441
02:20:09,076 --> 02:20:10,344
Arey, what is this?

3442
02:20:12,145 --> 02:20:13,814
Srikanth Ladies Emporium!

3443
02:20:15,015 --> 02:20:15,883
Thanks.

3444
02:20:16,016 --> 02:20:17,084
-How is it?
-Super.

3445
02:20:17,317 --> 02:20:20,220
Akka, this is brand new. Have a look

3446
02:20:21,855 --> 02:20:23,757
Why are you so dull?

3447
02:20:23,790 --> 02:20:26,927
I canâ€™t work as a mechanic anymore.

3448
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:29,029
Everyone is making fun of me.

3449
02:20:29,062 --> 02:20:30,931
I will go to Hyderabad...

3450
02:20:36,036 --> 02:20:37,538
Look, I was just like you.

3451
02:20:37,538 --> 02:20:39,506
Why do you want to
go elsewhere because

3452
02:20:39,506 --> 02:20:41,275
a random person is
not respecting you?

3453
02:20:41,308 --> 02:20:42,242
Tell me something?

3454
02:20:42,276 --> 02:20:45,112
Does anyone else in Jogipet knows
how well to repair a bike?

3455
02:20:45,145 --> 02:20:49,183
you will find 'shelf' respect
if you do your own work

3456
02:20:49,249 --> 02:20:50,684
Thatâ€™s it.

3457
02:20:50,918 --> 02:20:53,954
In the property will,
they got silver glasses

3458
02:20:54,454 --> 02:20:56,557
while we got copper pots.

3459
02:20:56,590 --> 02:20:58,025
Pots are bigger than the glasses.

3460
02:20:58,058 --> 02:20:59,193
You're the one benefiting

3461
02:20:59,226 --> 02:21:03,096
Can you show me where
the jewellery box is?

3462
02:21:03,697 --> 02:21:04,965
Iâ€™ll just come.

3463
02:21:04,998 --> 02:21:08,202
I am not able to find it.

3464
02:21:08,569 --> 02:21:12,339
Hey, Lawyer Chitti. When will you take up my case?

3465
02:21:12,372 --> 02:21:14,141
You need to fight hard for it

3466
02:21:14,141 --> 02:21:14,842
Hey, Srikanth...

3467
02:21:16,410 --> 02:21:18,011
Mom, I was looking for the jewellery box

3468
02:21:18,045 --> 02:21:19,346
Your friends have come.

3469
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:23,750
The contract for the first Indo Asian games

3470
02:21:23,784 --> 02:21:25,953
A lot of people suggested

3471
02:21:25,953 --> 02:21:29,957
we hand the contract over to
China, or Korea,

3472
02:21:29,990 --> 02:21:33,460
I rejected their advice,
fought with them and,

3473
02:21:36,663 --> 02:21:37,764
Swatantra Electronics

3474
02:21:37,965 --> 02:21:39,166
It's such an established company.

3475
02:21:39,166 --> 02:21:40,934
Itâ€™s not easy to get a job in such
a big company.

3476
02:21:40,934 --> 02:21:42,302
What did you guys do by going
to Hyderabad?

3477
02:21:42,336 --> 02:21:44,371
None of you got a job.

3478
02:21:44,838 --> 02:21:47,107
But we got realizations, uncle.

3479
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:48,876
Go to Dubai, you will get more, â€œrealizationsâ€

3480
02:21:49,042 --> 02:21:50,811
Come, letâ€™s plan the wedding.

3481
02:21:50,878 --> 02:21:52,846
You can't do one thing right.

3482
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,482
When will they get realisations?

3483
02:21:55,716 --> 02:21:58,151
What all we planned to do,
and all what happened

3484
02:21:59,219 --> 02:22:00,988
I wonder what was on that phone.

3485
02:22:01,021 --> 02:22:01,822
Our lives have changed.

3486
02:22:01,855 --> 02:22:02,689
Mama, give me your phone.

3487
02:22:03,123 --> 02:22:03,690
Why?

3488
02:22:03,724 --> 02:22:05,659
Weâ€™ll call Ramachandriah and
find out about the video.

3489
02:22:05,692 --> 02:22:06,260
Idiot!

3490
02:22:06,293 --> 02:22:07,294
This is all because of you.

3491
02:22:07,294 --> 02:22:08,829
If you think I'm the one
causing the problem,

3492
02:22:08,862 --> 02:22:09,863
I'll leave from here.

3493
02:22:19,072 --> 02:22:20,807
Sir, I am very nervous.

3494
02:22:20,841 --> 02:22:22,676
Interviewing you is a
big deal for me because

3495
02:22:22,709 --> 02:22:25,245
among all the politicians now,
you are very intelligent.

3496
02:22:26,180 --> 02:22:27,548
Can I ask you anything?

3497
02:22:28,448 --> 02:22:29,583
Sure!

3498
02:22:29,683 --> 02:22:32,319
Are you a bowler or batsman in Cricket?

3499
02:22:33,153 --> 02:22:34,755
I'm a goalkeeper in cricket.

3500
02:22:34,788 --> 02:22:35,789
Heh?

3501
02:22:35,822 --> 02:22:36,823
Huh.
