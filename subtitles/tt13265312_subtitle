1
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:41,875
The sweet smell is lost from the flowers

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:51,958
Someone needs to talk about it’s fate

3
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:56,041
Say something

4
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,750
Why so quiet?

5
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:05,916
Say something

6
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:10,375
I am lost without you

7
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,505
Now you won’t talk anything,

8
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,791
you must be tired after talking too much
in the night right?

9
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,333
“I want to give you 100 kisses.
I want to give you 200 kisses!”

10
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,375
Now what did I do?

11
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,708
Listen, this is it.
Now no more weekends in Matheran.

12
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,125
This obsession of yours to honeymoon
before marriage needs to end.

13
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,875
What has Matheran got to do with this?

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,125
Of course, it has got to do with it…

15
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,166
once this honeymoon gets
over then maybe you will start taking this seriously.

16
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,000
So you are saying that I am not serious?

17
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:41,708
No!

18
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,333
No as in? You are not saying that I am not serious?

19
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,291
No! You are not serious.

20
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,625
You think I am just goofing around with you?

21
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,208
That only you know.

22
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,541
What nonsense!

23
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,833
What do you want me to do?

24
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:18,333
My answer is not gonna change only
because you ask me the same question again and again.

25
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,625
You can say one more time…
it’s not like it’s gonna change another time.

26
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,666
Do you remember what you said last weekend?

27
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,125
That we will not eat from the hotel,
we will order from outside.

28
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,541
If you think it’s funny then I am going back.

29
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,291
Please please ok ok I am sorry…

30
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,333
look the weather is so romantic and you are like…

31
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,625
What? What am I like?

32
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,916
I told you I will talk to them.

33
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,041
You have been saying this for last one year.

34
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,291
8 months!

35
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:52,166
The way it’s going on, then one year
will be over soon…

36
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:53,833
I don’t know anymore.

37
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,416
You need to talk to your parents about us
today and I want their answer by tomorrow.

38
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,125
Where did today come from?

39
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,666
Listen I am not denying what you are saying…
I will talk to my parents

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,916
but right now there is too much going on in my home…
Chhotu has failed in his exam

41
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,166
and because of him there is too much drama happening.

42
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:13,958
I don’t care…

43
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,416
why should I suffer for the sins of your brother?

44
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,625
But where am I saying that you need to suffer,
I will talk to them.

45
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,291
But today.

46
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,916
How can I do this today?

47
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,416
Now how can I do this today?

48
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,875
I just told you about Chhotu.

49
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,083
It doesn’t matter to me…

50
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:33,125
and anyway if your brother has failed in his exams
then somewhere you are to be blamed for it.

51
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,458
What have I got to do with this?

52
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:36,875
Yes,

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,875
can’t you take the trouble to teach your
brother even for an hour?

54
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,083
You are a ranker from your college…

55
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,416
you can help your brother.

56
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,625
I don’t get any time after office hours.

57
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,500
Surprisingly on weekends you get enough time.

58
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,291
That is for you, my pumpkin.

59
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,166
For me or for sex?

60
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,916
Why do you keep on bringing sex
between us?

61
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,583
Talk to your parents today and I will not bring
sex between us.

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,416
And he did not fail because of me,

63
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,708
he failed because of himself…

64
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,208
he has no interest in studies...

65
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:16,875
and I have anyway spent 4 years in engineering
and I don’t have that great a memory to revise it for him.

66
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,291
But you gladly helped Preeti for her studies.

67
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,791
Where did Preeti come between all this?

68
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,375
Yeah I only taught her for a month...

69
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,625
and that too because she was serious about
her studies. Not like him.

70
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:38,666
Why everyone gives importance to someone who is already good…
why give food to someone who is already full…

71
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,750
he is your brother, he needs you

72
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,583
When did I say he is not brother?

73
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,541
Look I don’t want to argue with you...

74
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,916
are you talking to your parents today or not?

75
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,083
Give me some more time?

76
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,000
Enough time has gone by.

77
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:55,958
Just one more month?

78
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,833
Don’t even think about it!

79
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,250
I need to atleast think what would I say.

80
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,500
What were you doing for these many months?

81
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:09,166
You should have figured it out before proposing
me in front of 20 people?

82
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,208
That was a very well executed plan…

83
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,791
don’t you think, it was cinematic?

84
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,916
It was definitely cinematic...

85
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,291
but I should have rejected you in public
then you would have lost your face.

86
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,583
Reject me?

87
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,083
Yeah yeah,

88
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,750
you are such a big shot…as if!

89
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,083
Whatever it may be, you couldn’t say no.

90
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,833
I had pity for you…

91
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,541
if I had said no,

92
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,416
you would have gone home crying.

93
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,875
You could have rejected me later.

94
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,750
If you don’t talk to your parents today then
you might as well assume it’s a big fat no.

95
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:47,833
You go back to the same thing again and again,
look what a romantic weather it is, can’t you enjoy it?

96
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,708
To hell with your romantic weather…

97
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,958
look don’t change the topic…come to the point.

98
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,750
Okay, so the point is what shall I tell my parents?

99
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,291
You will have to figure that out.

100
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,125
Look...

101
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:13,375
my mother will accept our relationship one day or
the other but it’s my father who won’t.

102
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:14,776
So?

103
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,750
You know how he is…he won’t even let
Biryani be cooked at home.

104
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,416
This is fabulous…

105
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,041
first you divide us by colour,

106
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,875
saffron is his green is theirs

107
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,166
divide the animals,

108
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,916
cow is his and goat is theirs,

109
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,541
and now divide the food also…

110
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,666
But you know I don’t think like that.

111
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,083
Do you think...

112
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,166
there is something like Veg Biryani?

113
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:46,583
What?

114
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,041
Kidding love.

115
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,125
Okay

116
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,583
seriously, there won’t be any problem
at your home?

117
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,166
How many times should I tell you this?

118
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,333
My parents won’t be having any problem…

119
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,416
but yes...it’s you who would
have to speak to them about us.

120
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,083
And what if our parents stop talking to
each other because of us.

121
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,416
Let it be…

122
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,500
it’s not like your father comes to see us anyway…

123
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,833
Leave him, he is like that only,

124
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,416
you just give me some more time.

125
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,666
How much more time?

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,750
Just a bit more.

127
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,541
I don’t have time.

128
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:42,958
Seriously?

129
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,625
ok ok ok sorry.

130
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,666
So tell me what should I say at home?

131
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,208
Listen don’t involve me, I can’t help you with this.

132
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:14,875
Okay, and...

133
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,083
can’t you speak to my family about us?

134
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,125
Have some self respect…

135
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,750
I mean atleast for once act like a man…

136
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,916
sometimes I still wonder how did you even
propose me in front of everybody.

137
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,791
So you won’t speak to my parents?

138
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,208
Don’t even think about it.

139
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,291
My father will throw me out of the house.

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,791
I don’t mind.

141
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,458
You can stay at my home.

142
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,208
You think this is funny?

143
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah right...I am the one whose joking.

144
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,041
Look, I know he will not agree.

145
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:52,791
So?

146
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,875
So what’s the point of telling him?

147
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,083
So what is your plan then?

148
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:04,666
I will do some planning and then
I will plan what to tell them.

149
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,125
And what will change after that?

150
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,125
I mean your father will remain the same.

151
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,500
You know he won’t agree,

152
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,208
so what will you do then?

153
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,375
What do you mean, “what will I do?”

154
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,708
I mean, “what will we do?”

155
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,916
How will I know?

156
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,833
Haven’t you thought of something?

157
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,750
Seriously, I haven’t given it
much a thought…so please.

158
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,708
Can I ask you something?

159
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,208
No.

160
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,666
I am kidding pumpkin!

161
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,375
Are you willing to lose me?

162
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,625
Why are you talking like this?
Have you gone mad?

163
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,041
I am afraid and you can’t see that.

164
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,416
There is nothing to be afraid of.
I am here, I am not going anywhere.

165
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,000
I can’t afford to lose you.

166
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,916
Same here.

167
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,625
Then what will you do if your father doesn’t agree?

168
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,833
Look, to be very honest,

169
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,166
even my mom will not easily agree...

170
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:09,125
but I am sure she will eventually come around. It’s my father
who I fear will never get convinced. I am 100% sure of it.

171
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:10,833
Then?

172
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,458
Of course, I am not gonna run away from my home and get married
like some immature idiot. If the last option is to wait then let’s wait.

173
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,500
I mean to wait for the right time.

174
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,083
And when will your right time come?

175
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,416
How can I possibly predict that?

176
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,458
Aren’t you getting it?

177
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,750
Even I have someone to answer to,
even I have parents,

178
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,500
how long do you expect me to wait?

179
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,875
Don’t you think I also want to sort this out?

180
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,375
Did I say that?

181
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,875
Have you even given a reasonable response yet?
We have to be practical.

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And hopeful also.

183
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,625
That I am and that’s why we are here.

184
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,000
But I am done with all this.

185
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,166
Do you remember Vineet?

186
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:04,995
Yes

187
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,041
Your XXL Cousin?

188
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,041
Ya him.

189
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,250
You know what’s the biggest irony?

190
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,500
He married someone within the community
and it was a love marriage.

191
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,166
It’s been two years and yet he is not
able to come back to his house.

192
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,000
That I know…but what’s the biggest irony?

193
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,708
Irony is that I had met him last week.

194
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,958
He told me that his father has almost forgiven him...

195
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,541
but because of my devil dad,
he is not able to come home.

196
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,416
What society thinks really matters in this
day and age?

197
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,875
Or your father’s political career will go bad
if he starts being nice to people?

198
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,791
Who knows? It’s really difficult to make
him understand…

199
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,791
and I have got stuck between all this.

200
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:43,625
Stuck as in?

201
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,125
I am neither here nor there.

202
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,375
Then why did you propose me?

203
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,166
It’s not like I proposed you yesterday,
I proposed you five years back…

204
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,083
and I did it because I was in love with you…

205
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:58,833
what?

206
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:04,416
I still love you…why do you take
everything so literally?

207
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,208
Let’s sit?

208
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,708
It’s so peaceful here, right?

209
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:11,291
However nice Mumbai gets one can
never breathe in peace.

210
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:23,250
Weekend is fine, try staying here for more than a week then...
this same air will take the wind out of your sails.

211
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:27,791
Yeah your right…

212
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,458
Mumbai is like a caffeine to which
we are addicted.

213
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,416
And to Instagram.

214
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Sorry.

215
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,500
Talking of Instagram,

216
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,083
what happened to your friend Khushbu?

217
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,958
Oh yes, I almost forgot about her.

218
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,791
I mean seriously...

219
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,791
how insane that was?

220
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:54,791
I know.

221
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,750
Initially I thought she was being sarcastic.

222
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,750
Maybe she is trying to be funny. But then I realised
how can she be? She is your friend after all.

223
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,500
Yeah yeah, just like your friend Ankush.

224
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,625
What Ankush? He is not even my friend.
He just tags along with me.

225
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,500
But what happened to Khushbu?

226
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:11,625
Any idea?

227
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,500
Seriously,

228
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:17,333
I mean who declares their divorce
on Insta story?

229
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,458
And she was crying so much in the video.

230
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,083
Thank God she is not on tik tok.

231
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,500
And did you see that? Next day hashtag
breakup party.

232
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:26,708
Hmm…

233
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,666
I never understood this concept till date.

234
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,625
How can one throw a break up party,
I mean what are they even celebrating?

235
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,458
They can celebrate.

236
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:43,541
I always thought break up party is meant
only for boyfriend and girlfriend.

237
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:48,583
I mean, break up party after marriage…
that I don’t get.

238
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:49,625
Hmm…

239
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,916
What do you think whose fault was it?

240
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:58,958
Definitely Khushbu's.

241
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:01,416
How come?

242
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,208
She knew about Vivek and what kind of a player he is.

243
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,083
He has commitment issues.

244
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,375
but she never cared.

245
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,625
I warned her so many times

246
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,958
Just because she didn’t heed your advice it’s her fault?

247
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:15,666
It’s Vivek’s fault…

248
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,833
I mean, before marriage it’s fine but
after marriage, one needs to get a grip.

249
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:23,291
One minute…what you mean by before
marriage it’s fine?

250
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,583
Look after marriage one is officially committed
so you can’t just keep on hooking up.

251
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,500
Yes exactly another reason.

252
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,458
What another reason?

253
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:37,666
What?

254
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,541
What am I saying and what are you
even understanding?

255
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,416
All boys are same.

256
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,208
Even we can say the same thing.
All girls are the same.

257
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,333
Yes they are but unlike boys.

258
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,500
You all don’t need any rhyme or reason to
hook up with anybody.

259
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,541
Hello madam,

260
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,958
since the time I have proposed you,
I have never flirted with anyone.

261
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,958
Because you never got the chance…
you are a big time sissy.

262
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,916
That is why I dared to propose you
in front of everybody.

263
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,791
That was an exception.

264
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,125
And what else have I done that you keep
calling me sissy?

265
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:14,750
Chuck it.

266
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:16,541
What happened?

267
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:17,416
Leave it.

268
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,583
No no, tell me.

269
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,083
I don’t want to hurt your male ego.

270
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:22,833
Hmm…

271
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,500
I will try not to… tell me

272
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:28,916
Sure?

273
00:18:29,747 --> 00:18:30,289
Sure.

274
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,166
Hmm...

275
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,791
Do you remember Vivek’s party?

276
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:46,708
Who was scared to drink beer before going home?

277
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,083
You expect me to go home after drinking?
I didn’t want to reek of beer.

278
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:55,125
Who said about getting hammered…
it was just a matter of one beer.

279
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,875
Yeah, so I had one beer.

280
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,250
And who forced you?

281
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,833
You know how easily I get drunk.

282
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,583
But how come you are immune to
alcohol on weekends?

283
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,916
It’s not like that. I do get high on weekends but
I have my ways to get sober.

284
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,125
What kind of an example is this?

285
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:17,916
Doesn’t make sense at all.

286
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,083
Do you remember that office project...

287
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,916
when you missed the deadline?
I don’t know where you misplaced your files but…

288
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,166
That was a completely different thing.

289
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,958
I would have lost my job.

290
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,750
You goofed up...

291
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,083
and who took the blame?

292
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,708
Their should be some benefit of you being my senior.

293
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:10,625
Remember when once this restaurant manager stopped us
from singing “Happy birthday” song…who was then chickening out?

294
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,583
C’mon,

295
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,916
that was a public place…lot of eyes were
on us and I didn’t want to create a scene.

296
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,750
Save it,

297
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,833
each time some or the other excuse
comes out of you…Coward!

298
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,500
Okey, fine…yes I am a coward! Happy?

299
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,208
But not this time love…
you have to speak to your parents today.

300
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,875
How many times will you say the same thing?

301
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,250
Until and unless you don’t understand…

302
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,416
and anyway do you ever understand
anything at one go?

303
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,500
Yeah you are the only smarty pants here, right?

304
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Yes that I am, Mr. Junior?

305
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:44,458
Look if my male ego gets hurt then don’t come
after me messaging sorry sorry every now and then.

306
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,875
Thanks for reminding…

307
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,958
What’s this new drama you have started?

308
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:54,041
For every small thing you tend to feel bad…
and even when the other person is saying sorry…

309
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,000
you don’t answer…

310
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,125
how childish is this?

311
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,791
What what what? Childish?

312
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,000
So what?

313
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,750
You sure that’s childish?

314
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,541
Look,

315
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,500
again you are making me repeat?

316
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,208
Hmm…

317
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,166
Do you remember the mid term of our first
year in college?

318
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,166
Seriously?

319
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:20,916
What?

320
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,833
That was 8 years back.

321
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:23,583
So?

322
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,208
So people do change.

323
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,958
Exactly my point madam,
people do change.

324
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,708
Earlier you were like that,
now sometimes I am like this.

325
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,583
You want me to remind you what all
you used to do in our first year?

326
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:38,708
Go on.

327
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,375
Sure about it?

328
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,625
Hmm…

329
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,333
Game on.

330
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,958
The stage is all yours ma’am.

331
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:06,750
Remember the bike which you bought from your father’s
money to impress, what did you write on it?

332
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,583
“Don't not dare to touch me”.

333
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:20,333
And in second year of college,
what did you do to your hairstyle…Oh God!

334
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,333
What? Girls found it really cute.

335
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,708
Bullshit! They used to laugh behind your back.

336
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:30,958
Tsk tsk, you also pierced your ears.
Are the marks still there?

337
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,416
What is such big deal about it?

338
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:35,833
I mean four piercings in one ear…

339
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:39,375
we think twice even when getting one piercing.

340
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:42,416
Yeah, I was into it for two days.

341
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,750
Just because of your dad, coward.

342
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,208
Whatever.

343
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:54,875
And I told you to share our first year of
college days not the history of our entire college life.

344
00:22:55,833 --> 00:23:02,416
Sorry, you have done such awesome things
each year in college that I couldn’t resist.

345
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:05,583
Hmm…because you never enjoyed your college life.

346
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,000
Really? Who said that?

347
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:09,625
Of course…

348
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,458
you never came to a single party till our final year.

349
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,125
That is because in whichever party I went to,

350
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,833
you were never invited….

351
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,916
just because of your loser gang.

352
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,291


353
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:28,250
it may be, our parties were the most famous.

354
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:31,583
Rubbish! Where did you get that certified?

355
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,250
It’s the universal truth.

356
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,000
It’s the truth of your universe.

357
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,083
What all have you made me remember?

358
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:48,291
What?

359
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,750
Earlier, one used to think

360
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,958
when will we finish our education,
when will we graduate

361
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,083
and now it feels like where have
we got ourself stuck…

362
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:08,375
It’s a cycle,

363
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:12,041
as kids we used to cry about going to school

364
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:16,416
and now that school is over…
we are crying to go back.

365
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,583
I mean not literally but still.

366
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,375
Hmm…

367
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:26,666
Earlier I used to feel like once this education is
over then life will get sorted but the opposite happens.

368
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:28,333
I agree.

369
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:49,958
Get some muscles.

370
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,208
Strange

371
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,625
I never asked you this,

372
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:04,625
I mean

373
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:09,958
from our college days which
one was your best and worst moment?

374
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:14,041
You seriously want to know or
you are just messing with me?

375
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,041
Seriously,

376
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:18,083
we never spoke about it.

377
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,875
Because you are busy fighting
with me all the time.

378
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:23,000
Oh ho…don’t spoil the mood please.

379
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:25,208
Hmm…

380
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,458
then even you have to tell me.

381
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:33,208
Now where did this come from…
why is it compulsory for me to share the same thing.

382
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,166
Nothing is compulsory madam…

383
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,500
but somethings have their own pleasure.

384
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:40,333
Hmm…

385
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:41,875
will think.

386
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,083
Anyway since you have said this, I will start…

387
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:51,666
so the best and worst moment…okay...

388
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,541
So the best moment was

389
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,333
when I proposed you.

390
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:03,666
Hmm.

391
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:04,875
So you said yes…

392
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,083
and I went off to sleep…

393
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,916
and that moment between my shut eyes to
dreams full of you

394
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,166
was the best moment.

395
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:17,750
That’s cute...

396
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,166
but weird also but why the moment you
proposed me is not the best moment?

397
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:25,916
Look,

398
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,833
I knew that you would not say no to me

399
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:32,083
but to be very honest I wasn’t
100% sure at the same time…

400
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,208
and that moment when I proposed you,
I was shit scared.

401
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,708
And then when did you say yes,
I couldn’t comprehend what just happened…

402
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,375
I was numb...

403
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,666
then after dropping you at the hostel,
I directly went home…

404
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,875
Then we spoke over the phone till the
morning azaan...

405
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:58,625
and that moment between the end of our call and
and shutting of my eyes to go to sleep...

406
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,083
was the best moment…

407
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:07,833
I mean I could see the flashback of our
entire four years...

408
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:14,625
and that’s when I was slowly beginning to
realize that you said yes to me.

409
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:19,083
Ya...it was the best moment.

410
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,666
Now don’t fly so high alright...

411
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:37,625
but yes that was my best moment.

412
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:51,250
And worst…

413
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00,250
what was it?

414
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,916
I just told you the best.

415
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,500
What?

416
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,916
 Tell me...

417
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,375
You know very well that I can’t lie.

418
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:12,166
That is why I am asking….

419
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:15,750
But…

420
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,041
you will get hurt.

421
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,250
Really? You think?

422
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:23,791
You will start judging me.

423
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:28,583
You are not even telling me and on top of
it doing so much drama.

424
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,791
When your job placement happened…

425
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:39,083
So?

426
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:45,250
When your job placement happened…
I felt the worst.

427
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,666
But after that even you got a placement.

428
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,208
Yeah...

429
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:59,708
but at that time, my grades were better than yours…my CGPA was
higher than yours and I thought that I was more deserving…

430
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:03,583
that was then and when I did get the placement,
it was in some other company.

431
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:07,875
Yeah but after one year you joined my company.

432
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,458
Yeah by then you were my senior.

433
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,875
Oh God…so what?

434
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:18,375
So it’s not a big deal…back then I used to
feel differently…I am cool with it now.

435
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:19,750
Till when you felt?

436
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,250
What?

437
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,125
Bad.

438
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,625
What do you think I have noted the date in my calender…
earlier I used to feel bad, now I don’t.

439
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:29,458
Please now don’t create a drama…

440
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:33,583
whatever I felt I shared with you…

441
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:39,208
please please it’s your turn now…
you tell me…

442
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:41,125
please please please…

443
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:44,208
Initially I thought I shouldn’t share…

444
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:48,000
but after listening to you,
I feel like there is no point in hiding.

445
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:49,541
Go ahead.

446
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:53,541
I will start with my worst memory,
worst moment.

447
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:54,958
Okay.

448
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:03,458
You know there are many things which you
did during our college days that hurt me, but...

449
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:08,125
what happened during the annual celebration of
our office is something I will never forget.

450
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,666
Which one? That happens every year.

451
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:13,750
That one was our first annual celebration.

452
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:22,083
You got upset over something so small and
silly that you stopped talking to me for a month.

453
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:24,875
That was not over anything silly…

454
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,541
because of you one of my plant died…

455
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:30,041
and you know how possessive I am of my plants.

456
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,750
I didn’t do that on purpose…

457
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:37,583
you had kept your plant by the edge of the table.

458
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:41,458
And if you remember,
I brought the same plant the very next day.

459
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,750
Madam, sure the plant looked same but it wasn’t...

460
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:51,541
and I had already warned you that I didn’t want any decorations
around my table…but still you continued and killed it.

461
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:57,083
And when did I stop talking to you for a month…
I was just irritated for two or three odd days.

462
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:02,333
You don’t even remember, during
those days we were working on the same project…

463
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:08,916
you were forced to talk to me despite not wanting to but after
office hours you never picked up my phone call...

464
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:12,833
and you have no idea how difficult it was for me professionally.

465
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,018
Sorry…

466
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,908
sorry…

467
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:25,625
Leave it…now tell me your best
moment of the college…not of our office days.

468
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,375
Do you remember my guitar performance?

469
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:41,000
Hmm.

470
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,125
How everybody was applauding me…

471
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:50,375
everyone was praising…I mean I never
believe that I could perform that well.

472
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:55,666
I know it happened because of you…
where did you arrange those classes for me?

473
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,916
That was at Vijay’s place.

474
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:00,791
Yes...

475
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:03,666
the best part was besides you teaching me…

476
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:09,916
you know in that auditorium when
everyone was clapping and praising,

477
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:11,833
I was only watching you…

478
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:16,583
I could see that you were feeling so proud

479
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:19,708
and exactly that was the moment…

480
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,625
my best moment.

481
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:26,416
Sweet.

482
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,333
Anyway did your reports come?

483
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,250
What reports?

484
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,166
How many reports are supposed to come?

485
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:02,541
One from office…one…

486
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,250
How difficult it is for you to talk straight?

487
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,875
I forgot to pick those reports.

488
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:09,708
How careless you are?

489
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:14,000
Just call them...give your email id
and they will send you an email…simple.

490
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,250
Chill! I will collect it on Monday.

491
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:18,291
Great…

492
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:22,500
one has to chase you for two months
just to get your check up

493
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,291
done and then chase you for another
month to get you to collect your reports.

494
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:28,916
What’s the big deal, I will collect it.

495
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:29,916
Big deal?

496
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:33,416
In case you have forgotten, let me remind you…

497
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:35,625
you fainted. You passed out on the floor.

498
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,541
That was a different thing…
it was because of exhaustion.

499
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,125
Are you a doctor?

500
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:41,416
Am I an illiterate?

501
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,333
Stop with your predictions...

502
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:46,625
what if it’s diabetes?

503
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,541
Now whose becoming a doctor?

504
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:51,166
Even your dad is diabetic.

505
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:53,833
God, why did I even tell you?

506
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:55,250
Now you have already told me…

507
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:59,375
so call them and ask for your…all the reports.

508
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,458
Listen if I wanted to give my email id to them,
I would have done that already.

509
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,291
There is something called data privacy,
which you won’t understand...

510
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,958
It’s just a diagnose center.

511
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:13,333
You can’t trust anyone these days and
anyway what difference a day or two will make…

512
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:15,958
even if I have cancer, I am not dying anytime soon.

513
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:20,958
And if you have dengue then?

514
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:25,333
I know it’s a bad joke.

515
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:26,291
Very!

516
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,125
Let’s go...

517
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:34,125
Let’s go...

518
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:35,125
Let’s go...

519
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,833
Let’s go...

520
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,833
By the way, how’s your mom now?

521
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,041
Finally you remembered,

522
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:15,166
she is okay now…

523
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:20,750
was asking about you…
if you care to visit her then get yourself trimmed.

524
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,500
I will come next week to visit…

525
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,541
but how…

526
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:30,000
I mean how?

527
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,458
Don’t start again.

528
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,083
I am just wondering…

529
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
I mean how…

530
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,708
how can one get a fracture from falling of the bed.

531
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:40,916
You think this is funny?

532
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:42,958
But seriously, I mean it’s tragic for sure.

533
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:44,291
Yeah, as if you care.

534
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:45,625
I do care love.

535
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:49,166
You really don’t care.

536
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:51,416
Now who said that one can’t
laugh over tragedies of life?

537
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:53,916
When did I say no…

538
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,250
you can very well laugh…

539
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,375
and when your father’s leg fractures…

540
00:35:58,375 --> 00:35:59,791
then please go and laugh in front of him too…

541
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,250
then I will see…

542
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:03,208
how does comedy in tragedy looks like.

543
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,666
Why do you get serious all the time?

544
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:21,208
This work is still not over and it’s been 6 months.

545
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:24,625
This is no vehicle zone...

546
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:28,458
and the monsoon
have just ended so this will take time.

547
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,458
Good that it’s a no vehicle zone…

548
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:34,166
that’s why this place is still beautiful.

549
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:44,375
If people don’t come to hill station then who will?

550
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:48,583
I know…but people should know…
I mean people should use it not abuse it.

551
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,000
Calm down, my activist.

552
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,333
I am calm only.

553
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,916
Eeny meeny miny moe

554
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:12,375
Catch the tiger by his toe

555
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:16,333
What comes next, I don’t know
Where do we go, you should know

556
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,458
No no let’s go…let’s go back.

557
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:19,291
What happened?

558
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:22,958
My legs are hurting.

559
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:25,208
But we just sat a while back…

560
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:27,041
what’s got on to you?

561
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:29,375
How come?

562
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:32,875
How come your legs start paining every weekend?

563
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:33,791
Go to hell!

564
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:43,458
I also need to pee actually.

565
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:46,750
How come you end up peeing every half an hour?

566
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,583
Seriously you might be diabetic.

567
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,666
You know I have a tiny bladder and
I also finished two glasses of water in the morning.

568
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:55,083
What an achievement!

569
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,083
I will be back in a minute.

570
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:36,791
Hello, why are you not picking up my call…
since when am I trying to reach you?

571
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:42,583
You know right, at this time usually we go on our morning
walk…so I kept the phone in my bag…anyway tell me.

572
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:46,750
What should I say? You say…are you still playing good girl,
good girl or have you told him yet?

573
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,500
Yeah!

574
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:51,375
How did he react? So what did he say?
Will he tell his parents about you today?

575
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:52,541
He has to.

576
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,708
Nice nice…well done…that’s the attitude…

577
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,375
look, he has been delaying it for
the past eight months…how much more?

578
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:03,166
Hmm…
Anyway, when are you leaving from there?

579
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:06,416
yeah…we might leave in next 2 hours.

580
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:09,458
I will update you.

581
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:14,333
Okay okay, just make sure
he speaks to his parents today itself.

582
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,375
Ok bye.
Bye.

583
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,166
Who was it this early morning?

584
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:24,750
Ayushri.

585
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,208
And I thought, you said no more nonsense friends.

586
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:29,125
Go to hell.

587
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:34,416
But I am in heaven…why should I go to hell…
give me some water so that I can wash my hands.

588
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:35,291
No way!

589
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,541
I don’t carry my drinking water to wash
your dirty hands.

590
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:40,916
Okay, then I will…

591
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,041
Your bottle is anyway full.

592
00:39:56,708 --> 00:40:00,875
What are you doing? Please, put some more…

593
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:05,416
why are you being so uptight?
Next time try carrying a bigger bottle.

594
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:10,208
Sharing makes love grow fonder

595
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,000
Yikes!

596
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:22,875
What is this?

597
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:27,750
They call this hand sanitizer…
you should also carry this.

598
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:33,166
If you had a hand sanitizer then
why did you waste my water?

599
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:36,291
You call helping someone a waste?

600
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:40,208
That doesn’t mean you waste my drinking water.

601
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,958
But after this we are going to the hotel…
so what’s the point of saving?

602
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,833
Half way is still left.

603
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:47,750
We are half way in and you still haven’t
even touched the water.

604
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,750
I am not indulging you anymore.

605
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:54,875
Fine fine, I won’t take your water…happy?

606
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:00,666
As if this bottle is big enough for us to share.

607
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,708
Madam, if there is a will, there is a way.

608
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:06,875
Look, who is talking?

609
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,333
What are you thinking now?

610
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:11,916
You yourself don’t share anything
so stop pretending.

611
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:17,958
Some more water please…

612
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:18,750
Just run away!

613
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:22,583
If I run then I will feel even more thirsty…
let me have just one sip.

614
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:36,625
Drink properly.

615
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:37,916
I am done.

616
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,208
Anyway listen.

617
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,166
I am right here.

618
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,041
Even if I didn’t wish to…
I will still hear you.

619
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:13,208
Tell me one thing...

620
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,375
I don’t know about the other planets that
Mr. Musk has his eyes on…

621
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:21,666
but on Earth are you the cutest?

622
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:23,208
Don’t bore me.

623
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,333
What love? Why are you so unromantic?

624
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:28,291
Yes! I am very unromantic.

625
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,958
Will you recite a poem for me?

626
00:42:57,791 --> 00:43:00,625
Which one and why now?

627
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:04,916
The same one that you left me for last night.

628
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,458
It’s not complete yet.

629
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:10,375
So recite the incomplete one.

630
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:14,041
What will you do listening?
You don’t even understand poetry.

631
00:43:15,379 --> 00:43:16,166
Listen,

632
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:21,833
I am that not dumb...I accept I may not be able to
understand but I feel nice when you recite.

633
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:25,541
I am not in a mood.

634
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:28,000
Not in a mood?

635
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:32,041
So much tantrum for a part time poet…

636
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:35,666
the thought of full time poets scares the hell out of me.

637
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:37,458
Haha! Very funny.

638
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:41,166
Now is not the right time, you won’t get it.

639
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:43,083
Not the right time?

640
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:44,958
What did you say?

641
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:47,333
You will not get a better time then this…

642
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:52,708
see there is a lake…there is a
mountain…sun…monkeys…

643
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,916
and I am sure there will be more animals…
even the cutest one is here with you, what else do you want?

644
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:04,041
C’mon, how lovely is the weather. Please!

645
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:44,333
Go ahead.

646
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:55,708
He never understood me

647
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,166
Or he has never tried

648
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:04,708
Is he listening to me or is he pretending

649
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:09,833
Is he talking to me or the words are for
someone else

650
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:15,208
Whom should I question for I don’t
know where the answer is

651
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:19,791
I wish to cry but I know it’s of no use

652
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:25,583
It would have been better had I not
given my heart away

653
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:30,750
It would have been better had I not
given my heart away

654
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:32,625
It’s too late now

655
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:38,750
I feel that his destiny belongs to someone else

656
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:43,875
Why am I the only one whose punished
for the choices

657
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:48,000
Why am I the only one whose punished
for the choices

658
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:50,541
For I am only partly responsible

659
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,666
Punishment needs to be duely shared

660
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:55,208
Don’t search only here

661
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:57,875
For the offender is somewhere else too.

662
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,416
That’s intense.

663
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:12,750
It was meant to be.

664
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:22,625
You didn’t write this for me, right?

665
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:38,958
Why don’t you write full time?

666
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:44,375
Because the thought of a full time
poet scares you.

667
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:46,500
C’mon love, I am serious.

668
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:48,000
No sir,

669
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:49,791
I like my work…

670
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:54,250
and nobody becomes a poet with two or three applauses.

671
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:58,166
But you write so well.

672
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:02,458
I seriously doubt your knowledge
towards literature.

673
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:05,583
Fine,

674
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:09,833
don’t take my advice…it’s your loss not mine boss.

675
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,083
Please!

676
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:13,250
Didn’t it rhyme well?

677
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:33,500
I am not trying to butter you…I am just trying to help.

678
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:36,208
Okay, let’s walk faster now.

679
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:37,208
What happened?

680
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:38,708
Yeah, lets go.

681
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,208
What happened?

682
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:41,583
I am hungry.

683
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,750
But you are never hungry this early in the morning.

684
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:46,375
I am feeling hungry now.

685
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:49,666
Are you fooling me?

686
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,375
Do I have to?

687
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:56,916
Your mood is off today.

688
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,500
Can I ask you a question?

689
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:15,416
No.

690
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:19,125
I never understood this…

691
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:21,791
during our college days,

692
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,833
every girl wanted to date these bad boys…

693
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:32,250
and they would take one look at me and say, "you are so sweet,
you are so cute. He is not a boyfriend material."

694
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,708
What is this boyfriend material?

695
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:39,083
And there was this one guy who proposed you, who used
to come in his bike...what was his name? Rishabh?

696
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,000
Every single girl was after him…

697
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:44,083
you said no to him and said yes to me…

698
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:49,041
I mean what did you see in me?

699
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:52,125
Hmm...

700
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:58,333
It’s not like what you are thinking…

701
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:00,291
but yes,

702
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:02,166
you are a little different.

703
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:13,416
While all the boys would get roses
to their girlfriends…

704
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:18,500
just because you don’t like to pluck flowers,
you ended up gifting me a whole plant.

705
00:49:23,791 --> 00:49:25,375
Remember our first date?

706
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:31,125
I thought you would ask me which
restaurant or club to go to but

707
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:36,500
instead you took me to the beach for
coconut water.

708
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:43,375
Who knew...

709
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:51,666
then while writing on the sand
we were also writing our own story?

710
00:49:52,862 --> 00:49:53,862
That’s good.

711
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:56,625
Give me some water.

712
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:03,458
And whenever you would get free time or day off,

713
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:07,125
you used to take me to art galleries
instead of a mall…

714
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:09,833
so different you are.

715
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,083
Hmm...

716
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:12,750
I know

717
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:14,125
I am awesome…

718
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,250
I am thinking what should I compliment
you with

719
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:21,416
but nothing’s coming.

720
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:25,166
Sure!

721
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:48,750
Up for a song?

722
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:51,666
No.

723
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:53,791
It’s your kind of romantic song.

724
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:55,041
I doubt.

725
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:57,916
If you don’t like it then remove the earphones.

726
00:50:58,958 --> 00:50:59,541
Okay?

727
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:00,166
Hmm.

728
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,458
Give me your earphones.

729
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:05,375
I straightened it a while back.

730
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:56,041
Should I play?

731
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:56,875
Hmm.

732
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,000
You are the one

733
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:18,791
Who accepted me

734
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:25,250
with all my flaws

735
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:32,500
Like the crying clouds chancing upon

736
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:39,250
The Sun and shape shifts with joy

737
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,125
You are the one

738
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:46,500
You are the reason

739
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:53,458
Of my existence

740
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:57,083
You are the one

741
00:52:57,333 --> 00:53:00,291
You are the reason

742
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:07,875
Why I smile

743
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:15,083
Possibly this special bond I feel only with you,

744
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:22,333
I don’t know why, I feel sad without you.

745
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:28,875
Possibly this special bond I feel only with you,

746
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:36,750
I don’t know why, I feel sad without you.

747
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:13,583
How can I forget that moment

748
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,791
When I found you in the dark fog of loneliness

749
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:28,375
You are the first person

750
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,083
who heard the song of my heart

751
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:41,750
I am still not able to imagine

752
00:54:42,666 --> 00:54:48,541
How close our relationship holds

753
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,208
You are the one

754
00:54:52,541 --> 00:54:55,750
You are the reason

755
00:54:56,083 --> 00:55:02,500
Of my existence

756
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:06,541
You are the one

757
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,500
You are the reason

758
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:17,500
Why I smile

759
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:24,833
Possibly this special bond I feel only with you,

760
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:31,666
I don’t know why, I feel sad without you.

761
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:38,416
Possibly this special bond I feel only with you,

762
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:46,583
I don’t know why, I feel sad without you.

763
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:09,208
How was it?

764
00:56:12,992 --> 00:56:13,450
Hmm…

765
00:56:14,797 --> 00:56:15,339
what happened?

766
00:56:16,964 --> 00:56:17,547
Nothing.

767
00:56:20,373 --> 00:56:21,165
I know…

768
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:25,333
even I had the same feeling when
I heard this song for the first time…

769
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:28,750
it’s so good right, it’s first on my playlist now.

770
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:37,250
Should we just head back to our hotel?

771
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,875
We will go to a good place for lunch today…
not like the last time…

772
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:44,125
what we will do is, we go to the hotel
and quickly order breakfast...

773
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,958
I know you don't like hotel's breakfast...

774
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:50,916
so you order omelette, toast and tea
I will just have tea and toast…

775
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:52,958
atleast they won’t fuckup with it…

776
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:58,083
then let’s pack and on our way we will find a
nice place with a beautiful view to have lunch.

777
00:56:58,983 --> 00:56:59,525
What do you say?

778
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:03,666
Hmm?

779
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:09,791
Madam, are you alright? I know it’s a good song but it’s
not great a song that you go inside your shell…hmm…

780
00:57:12,212 --> 00:57:12,916
come.

781
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:17,000
Talk to your parents today.

782
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:20,166
You are going round and round in
circles to where you started.

783
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:23,458
I told you I will talk to my parents,
just give me some more time.

784
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:25,458
I can’t give you more time.

785
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:26,333
Why?

786
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:28,772
I think I am pregnant.

787
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:41,250
What do you mean you think you are pregnant?
What do you mean?

788
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:44,541
I have not got my periods.

789
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:47,375
Since when?

790
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:49,958
It’s been two months.

791
00:57:55,959 --> 00:57:56,584
Now what?

792
00:57:58,416 --> 00:57:59,375
Now I don’t know...

793
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:02,625
I have taken doctor’s appointment on Monday.

794
00:58:06,166 --> 00:58:07,541
How did this happen?

795
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,000
Black magic I guess…

796
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:12,791
what do you mean how did this happen?

797
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:14,041
What I mean is…

798
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:17,041
I was careful that nothing of this sort would
happen…you should had also been responsible.

799
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:18,166
Look,

800
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:20,250
I am already stressed out…

801
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:23,500
I am not blaming you or asking you to take
any responsibility…

802
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,000
if you can’t be supportive then don’t
even indulge in blame game.

803
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,541
Ok ok…sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry.

804
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:37,083
Did you do the test by yourself?

805
00:58:37,777 --> 00:58:38,625
Obviously…

806
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:39,171
Then?

807
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:46,416
It’s complicated and I can’t explain you,
that’s why I have taken doctor’s appointment.

808
00:58:49,147 --> 00:58:49,647
Shit!

809
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:06,666
What are you gonna do now?

810
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,916
What do you mean, what are you
gonna do now?

811
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:12,833
You are meeting the doctor on Monday right…
so what are you gonna do about it?

812
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:14,375
I am not sure.

813
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:19,750
You are not sure that your pregnant or
you are not sure what you gonna do?

814
00:59:20,916 --> 00:59:23,375
I am not sure that I am pregnant.

815
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:27,666
And what if you are?

816
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:28,750
What if I am?

817
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:31,458
What will you do if you are pregnant?

818
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:34,291
Obviously, I will abort it.

819
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:39,916
Why do you want to abort?

820
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:44,500
So without getting married, I should
bring kid to office?

821
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:47,250
I didn’t mean that…

822
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,500
What did you mean then?

823
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:59,041
Okay then postpone Monday’s appointment?

824
01:00:00,146 --> 01:00:00,729
Why?

825
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:03,625
I will come with you for the appointment
on Tuesday or Wednesday.

826
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:04,458
Oh please,

827
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:07,125
don’t trouble yourself.

828
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:08,916
Why are you talking like this?

829
01:00:08,916 --> 01:00:10,083
Then how should I talk?

830
01:00:15,833 --> 01:00:19,583
Okay you know what? I will talk to
my parents today itself… today it is.

831
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:21,625
Oh Please! no need.

832
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:22,958
No need?

833
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:27,583
Since morning I have been telling you…go and tell your parents…
please go and tell your parents and you were like you want more time…

834
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:28,375
now what changed?

835
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:32,041
Back then I didn’t know you were pregnant…
I mean probably pregnant.

836
01:00:32,916 --> 01:00:34,833
So you were waiting for me to get pregnant?

837
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:36,958
Why are you talking nonsense?

838
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:42,000
It’s been months I have been asking you to tell
your parents. You didn't feel it was nonsense then.

839
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,208
I am telling you that I will speak to them today.

840
01:00:49,416 --> 01:00:51,583
If I had known this, then I would
have been pregnant long back.

841
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:53,149
Not funny okay.

842
01:00:58,797 --> 01:00:59,588
Ok listen...

843
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:04,458
What if you talk to your parents today
and the test comes negative?

844
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:10,916
What? You really think just because you are pregnant…I mean
probably pregnant that’s why I am talking to my parents?

845
01:01:11,366 --> 01:01:12,033
Maybe!

846
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,708
What maybe…don’t you know me?

847
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:16,166
I know that’s why.

848
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:25,291
Listen, this incident is just an excuse. I never said that I will not
speak to them about us…all I asked was for some more time.

849
01:01:35,588 --> 01:01:36,171
Okay then...

850
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,067
talk to your parents today…

851
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:44,791
but don’t tell me to postpone the appointment. If I go on
Monday or Wednesday what difference will it make?

852
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:49,125
That is what even I am saying…it hardly makes
a difference if you go on Monday or Wednesday.

853
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:52,666
Atleast give me a reason for cancelling the appointment.

854
01:01:58,453 --> 01:01:59,036
Look,

855
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,875
if you are pregnant I don’t want you to get an abortion.

856
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:08,291
Now where did this come from?

857
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:10,125
I am not kidding.

858
01:02:10,371 --> 01:02:11,371
Oh really?

859
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:27,458
I will talk to my parents today.

860
01:02:29,048 --> 01:02:29,465
Look...

861
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:38,208
I never said that I will not speak to them,
all I asked was to wait for the right time.

862
01:02:46,358 --> 01:02:47,108
Okay,

863
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,875
you tell them about us...

864
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,416
but what if I am pregnant…

865
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,541
it’s obvious your father will not accept us,
what then?

866
01:02:58,166 --> 01:03:02,125
I mean let us imagine for a minute or so,

867
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:07,208
if I didn’t abort and at the same time your
father doesn’t accept us then

868
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:08,670
what will you do?

869
01:03:09,836 --> 01:03:10,836
Simple.

870
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:12,208
Like...

871
01:03:12,916 --> 01:03:15,833
I am capable of taking care of a family now…
we still stay somewhere else.

872
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:19,416
But you are the one who said that we will
never run away and get married.

873
01:03:19,416 --> 01:03:20,750
How is this running away?

874
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:21,958
What else is this?

875
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:29,083
Look don’t trap me with “imagine this and imagine that”…I am not
falling for it. I told you I will speak to them today…end of conversation.

876
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:19,708
If I wouldn’t have told you about my pregnancy,
would you have spoken to them?

877
01:04:20,076 --> 01:04:21,826
What difference does it make?

878
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:23,154
It makes a hell lot of difference.

879
01:04:23,154 --> 01:04:23,571
What?

880
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:26,708
I don’t want to pressurize you in making
any decision.

881
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:28,333
It’s not like that.

882
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:35,583
Since when I have been saying to tell your parents...to please tell your
parents…then you wanted more time and now you swiftly agreed.

883
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:41,375
When did I ever say that I will not speak to them.
All I have ever asked was for more time.

884
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:44,500
So an hour back you didn’t feel it was the right time?

885
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:49,500
The right opportunity doesn’t wait for right time…
it depends on certain conditions.

886
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:51,708
What?…what did you say?

887
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:56,125
Look, I am still not sure if you are pregnant or not

888
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:58,833
but I know one thing that I love you and
I want to marry you.

889
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:03,500
And I will definitely talk to my parents today…that’s it…
full and final and after that whatever happens we will see.

890
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,750
What a surprise! From being a sissy
to a brave lion.

891
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:17,833
I am a big time sissy that’s why
I will talk to them.

892
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:24,000
I didn’t know that my pregnancy news
would work so efficiently.

893
01:05:26,578 --> 01:05:27,578
You are not lying right?

894
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:32,333
So what if it’s a lie…won’t you talk
to your parents today?

895
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:35,500
Look, you are not messing with me right?

896
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:36,500
What do you think?

897
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,708
If I knew what’s going on, you think
I would ask you?

898
01:05:39,118 --> 01:05:40,201
That’s the point…

899
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:42,187
you are hopeless.

900
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:58,416
You are sure, right?

901
01:05:58,916 --> 01:06:01,958
You are mad or what? What is this “are you sure”
“are you sure” like an out of tune machine?

902
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,833
Look, I don’t want you to get hyper and
take any decision.

903
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:09,875
How...

904
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:13,916
Why are you smiling?

905
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:28,911
What?

906
01:06:28,911 --> 01:06:29,708
Ok!

907
01:06:49,857 --> 01:06:51,023
Is this a joke?

908
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:53,916
Will you marry me?

909
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:56,791
Are you serious?

910
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:58,708
Please answer me…my knees are hurting.

911
01:07:05,418 --> 01:07:06,460
Can I?

912
01:07:07,573 --> 01:07:09,198
Of course!

913
01:07:27,458 --> 01:07:33,041
I thought I will surprise you but instead
you gave me a bigger surprise.

914
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:44,000
In these 5 years, you never hugged me like this.

915
01:07:44,433 --> 01:07:44,916
Hmm...

916
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:51,125
In these 5 years, you never did
anything that deserves a hug like this.

917
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,958
So cute you are...so cute you are.

918
01:07:55,608 --> 01:07:56,233
Okay then…

919
01:07:57,208 --> 01:08:01,666
when I reach home I will tell my parents and
I am sure your parents will hear from them.

920
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:03,208
Yes! right?

921
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:21,125
Look at the view madam…look at the view.

922
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:29,791
Listen,

923
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,541
I am not ready for the child.

924
01:08:34,589 --> 01:08:35,047
It’s alright

925
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:39,208
we can talk about it tomorrow…

926
01:08:39,208 --> 01:08:41,916
atleast for today we had enough drama.

927
01:08:42,905 --> 01:08:43,322
Okay?

928
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:54,875
Is your phone ringing?

929
01:09:03,462 --> 01:09:05,545
It’s my mother.

930
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,166
Hello…where are you?

931
01:09:11,416 --> 01:09:12,541
What happened mother?

932
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:15,958
You better come home as soon as possible…
your father…your father…

933
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:17,166
Is father alright?

934
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:21,666
He has found all your greeting cards…
and he has taken them next door…

935
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:25,583
he knows everything now…
you better come home quickly.

936
01:09:25,583 --> 01:09:27,333
I think he is back...

937
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:33,000
What happened?
