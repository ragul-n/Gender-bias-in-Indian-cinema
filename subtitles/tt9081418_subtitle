1
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,600
Excuse me?

2
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,880
I think there's too much
caffeine in my coffee...

3
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,600
No, Sir. The usual amount.

4
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,960
Okay.

5
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,720
Bro... let's go back please.
I left something behind.

6
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,120
Hi...

7
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,360
Hi?

8
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,320
Hey, are you okay?

9
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,120
Are you... okay?

10
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,360
Do you feel sick?

11
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,960
So a complete blackout?

12
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,000
Has this happened before?

13
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,720
As in?

14
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,240
As in, the way it
happened with Gayetri.

15
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,800
No... honestly, I never met
anyone in this way before.

16
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,440
In your school, college, university...

17
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Didn't you have any friends?

18
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,960
As in no... 'girlfriends'?

19
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,840
No.

20
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,680
And male friends?

21
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,960
Yes... Shakti and Sandipan.

22
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,920
Don't you like women?

23
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,720
No. I've never tried to
be with women.

24
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,360
Who all are there in
your family?

25
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,760
I and Baba.

26
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,200
I have to go now.

27
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,880
She studied in Bristol.

28
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,160
Very professional.

29
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,160
I hear she lives alone here.

30
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,960
She was quite popular
in the Delhi office.

31
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,800
Obviously. She is so damn pretty.

32
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,520
Yes, Sir. Very pretty!

33
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,360
Binoy has no interest in all this.

34
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,160
Interest in what?

35
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,120
Gayetri Sen. Our new executive.

36
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,040
Have you seen her?

37
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,160
Why won't he?
She so gorgeous.

38
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,320
I must go in now.

39
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,440
Told you, he is not
interested in all this.

40
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,520
He's faking it. Must've
gawked at her secretly.

41
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,880
Hello buddy! Are you floored now?

42
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,680
Chuck the lust and
concentrate on your work.

43
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,840
Baba...

44
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,160
What is it?

45
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,400
How much was your
last sugar level?

46
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,680
I don't remember.

47
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
I do.

48
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,640
Fasting: 170. And PP: 270!

49
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,440
This is your fifth peg.

50
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,600
Chuck it, please!

51
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,680
You know...

52
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,040
the first time I proposed to
a girl, I was five pegs down.

53
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,960
Before that, for a long time...

54
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,040
I could not say anything.

55
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
I was in the 12th standard.

56
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,520
Who was that?

57
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,040
Oh well, she was something!

58
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,680
Tamali. From the
next neighbourhood.

59
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,960
It didn't last.

60
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,280
But in one way, it did
help me. This...

61
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,400
This... hesitance to speak up...
That was...

62
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,320
This was gone for good.

63
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,640
So there were more?

64
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,120
Obviously.

65
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,880
Yes. But all of them
were before marriage.

66
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,800
You see, I was a romantic. I
kept falling in love frequently.

67
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,520
But none of them lasted very long.

68
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,360
You see, this strong thing that
boys have over their girlfriends...

69
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,360
I mean, there's this...

70
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,200
possessiveness...

71
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,800
I never...

72
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,320
I never had that.

73
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,080
Others were like that. But I...

74
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,600
I guess...

75
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,640
only in your mother's
case I was...

76
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,120
No...

77
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,440
Not exactly possessive though... but...

78
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,760
I did have something.

79
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,720
Baba... don't drink
anymore, please!

80
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,280
Nothing will happen to me.

81
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,160
Let me tell you about
this funny incident...

82
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,240
What happened was...

83
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,440
So I asked two girls...

84
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,440
to come to the same
place at the same time.

85
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,160
And no mobile phones back then!

86
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,920
I can't stop them!

87
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,000
I was wondering what
to do... And then...

88
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,800
I... I decided to bunk it myself.

89
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,440
I didn't go.

90
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,040
They both came and waited at
the same place. And then left.

91
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,200
But...

92
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,640
What is it with you?

93
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,640
What about me?

94
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,280
Is there no one you like?

95
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,560
No one you fancy?

96
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,080
I don't understand how you can turn
out to be like this, being my son...

97
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,560
Tell me? Do you like someone?

98
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,160
You can tell me!
I am your friend, right?

99
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,000
So, Baba...

100
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,640
Maa was very pretty, wasn't she?

101
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
Oh yes!

102
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,560
Yes! She was!

103
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,360
Didn't you face any problem?

104
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,120
Problem?

105
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,160
What problem?

106
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,400
Give me a cigarette please.

107
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,680
So... what was that problem
you were talking about?

108
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,960
Nothing.

109
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,320
Drops of water tremble
on the lotus leaves

110
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,640
I see no flowers nearby

111
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,879
Desires

112
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,440
A flurry of desires

113
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,480
I sink inside, to explore the
deep, dense waters

114
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,120
In search of a flowerbud
Looking for a sky

115
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,080
Son, let's have dinner.

116
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,040
You go ahead, Baba.
I'll eat later.

117
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,640
Maybe the flowerbud

118
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,120
Waiting to blossom Waiting

119
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,880
Has now aged over the ages

120
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,040
I thought I had nothing
to offer to the wild wind

121
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,440
Yet, since this morning
My desires do inspire me

122
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,320
Hope it won't fly away

123
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,520
What if it immolates you?

124
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,120
I shall die happily
Make no efforts to survive

125
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,360
What if it elevates you to the clouds?

126
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,600
The rains
They can pierce through me

127
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,440
And if reduces to mere dust...

128
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,560
I will fly from one
path to another

129
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,920
Fly, will you? What if the
wings are tattered?

130
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,800
I'd take the fall
And hold onto a branch

131
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,640
And if it rids you off the branch?

132
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,680
The meeting is at 2, Binoy!
Where's the PPM?

133
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,080
Hey, Binoy!

134
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,400
A warm embrace is all
I will have to offer then...

135
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,200
In your court, I stand to be judged...
Have anything else to say?

136
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,080
Go ahead then. Suffer
the plight all your life.

137
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,360
No news of you today...
Are you okay?

138
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,960
Thought you must be busy.

139
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,920
I was a bit busy. But was also
waiting for your message.

140
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Must I message you every
moment from tomorrow?

141
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,320
That would a little too much.

142
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,200
I live alone here.

143
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,280
My parents stay in Delhi.

144
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,600
Isn't it tough to be alone?

145
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,960
It's difficult.

146
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,280
I quite like it.

147
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,040
What else do you like?

148
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,440
To live...

149
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,720
Where do you find all
this positive energy?

150
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,960
You've to look for it.
There's so much of it around.

151
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,000
Oh, all of it is truth!

152
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,480
Let us go then, you and I,

153
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,080
When the evening is
spead out against the sky

154
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,120
What's he mumbling?

155
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,040
Like a patient etherized
upon a table;

156
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,560
Let us go...

157
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,000
Hey...

158
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,560
Did you get to meet her?

159
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,960
Why are you spying on me?

160
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,360
You're not Binoy Majumdar...
the poet. Who are you then?

161
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,880
Who am I...

162
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,960
If I say, I am what my name is
It'll be a lie

163
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,320
If I say, I am what I do...

164
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,320
I stay close to the truth

165
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,080
And if I say, I am what I think...
then I touch the deepest truth

166
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,640
Who am I?

167
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,600
I want to see you.

168
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,480
So, how did you finally meet her?

169
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,920
My fault.

170
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,680
I should've hidden the sleeping pills.

171
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,800
I don't want to buy anything.

172
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,680
Please don't dusturb
so early in the morning!

173
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,120
I'm not here to sell anything.

174
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,600
I am... Bimal Basu...

175
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,320
Binoy Basu's father.

176
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,520
You are Gayetri Sen, right?

177
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
Yes...

178
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,400
So?

179
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,600
I need to speak to you.

180
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,080
I can come back later if you want.

181
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,400
No...

182
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Please come...

183
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,960
Sorry to disturb you so early
in the morning on a holiday.

184
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,200
No problem. Sit.

185
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,640
Can I have some water?

186
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,240
Oh yes, of course!

187
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,360
Thank you.

188
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,160
You can't recognize
who Binoy is, isn't it?

189
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,240
Which Binoy is this?

190
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,920
Binoy Basu.

191
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,640
You two work in the
same office. He's a writer.

192
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,520
Oh... the copywriter... Binoy.

193
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,120
Yes. Right.

194
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,760
Is he alright?

195
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,720
Is he good?

196
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,840
I don't know how to
tell you this...

197
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,320
Sorry, I am sparing the formalities.

198
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,840
You are my son's age.

199
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,360
No problem.

200
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,640
No. There is a problem.

201
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,600
There is a problem.

202
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,680
Let me tell you everything clearly.

203
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,000
Look, Binoy is my only son.

204
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,840
His mother is not there.

205
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,120
I brought him up.

206
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,400
We meet after work everyday.

207
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,600
Our rooms are next
to each other.

208
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,560
You see, he has grown
up now but...

209
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,000
he still doesn't close
his room's door to sleep.

210
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,320
Recently...

211
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,600
In the last few
days I've noticed...

212
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,200
he closes the door after
he is back from work.

213
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,720
I thought, after all
he's grown up now.

214
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,600
Needs his privacy.

215
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,400
He is an introvert, you see.

216
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Doesn't speak out much.

217
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,920
But...

218
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,680
there have been certain
incidents in the last few days...

219
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,480
So I am really worried.

220
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Drugs?

221
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,720
No! Nothing like that!

222
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,000
He drinks occassionally.

223
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,120
He drinks with me as well.

224
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,240
We don't keep any...

225
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,800
walls between ourselves.

226
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,080
The problem is...

227
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,920
a few days ago I saw a strip
of sleeping pills in his room.

228
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,560
I was so scared!

229
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,000
So I started reading his
diary secretly.

230
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,920
And I realised he doesn't
sleep at night.

231
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,720
I understood, something
is bothering him.

232
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,120
I kept reading. And
then on one page...

233
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,640
I read your name.

234
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,640
My name?

235
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,920
I've never... We've never really...

236
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,640
spoken.

237
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,880
Yes. He has written that.
That he cannot speak to you.

238
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,480
He watches you from a distance.

239
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,360
I think...

240
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,720
he really likes you.

241
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
But he cannot say it.

242
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,000
Look, I am his father.

243
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,480
I am always worried...

244
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,600
that he will end up
doing something.

245
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,920
I suggest... if you can
just talk to him once...

246
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,160
Strange.

247
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
I mean...

248
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,480
Honestly...

249
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,680
We've never even been
introduced to each other.

250
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,720
And he is in love with me...

251
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,040
The sleeping pills...
it's extremely weird.

252
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,160
What do I say?

253
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,480
Look...

254
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,760
He does not have
anyone else but you.

255
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,000
I am always scared that he
will end up doing something.

256
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,400
I'll never be able to
forgive myself.

257
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,000
He is hiding it from me.

258
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,160
He's hiding from his friends too.

259
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,960
So I came to you directly.

260
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,000
I don't know how much
I can help. But...

261
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,440
I will speak to him at work.

262
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,240
Thank you. Thank you very much.

263
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,760
I'll get you some tea.

264
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,760
Baba, your phone is ringing.

265
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,120
Shakti?

266
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,320
Hello?

267
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,880
Hello, Uncle!
Did you meet Gayetri?

268
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,920
What did she say?

269
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,280
Hello?

270
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,240
Hello? Uncle?

271
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,040
Hello...

272
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,320
He tells you everything I suppose.

273
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,320
Did he ever speak about me?-
- Yes. We're very close.

274
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,256
He tells us everything.
But he's a little shy.

275
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,360
Basically, he has an issue.

276
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,720
Otherwise he is cool. But he
gets concious around women.

277
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,760
He's old enough now.
But never had an affair.

278
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,760
What sort of a problem is this!-
- No idea. But it's about women.

279
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,720
Maybe he doesn't like
their company.

280
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,000
Is he gay?

281
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,800
I've never given this a thought.
But it's possible.

282
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,280
Once, at this party...
he got completely drunk...

283
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,000
then he hugged me and slept off.

284
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,160
What nonsense!

285
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,640
Though he was only sleeping.
He didn't do anything.

286
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,800
Don't you remember? You
too got drunk and slept off.

287
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,680
No way. Binoy is not gay.

288
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,440
It was he who gave me
Monica Bellucci's vital stats.

289
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,400
Sorry... but he isn't gay.

290
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,560
Hey... have you already eaten?
I got Biriyani...

291
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,560
Why do this behind my back?

292
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,640
But I know you love Biriyani.

293
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,680
Baba, I know where you
went and why.

294
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Look... you never...

295
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,920
tell me anything. So I thought...-

296
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,920
- So you went to Gayetri?
And what is there to tell you?

297
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,200
I got scared.

298
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,960
I saw those sleeping
pills in your room.

299
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,120
Why do you touch my
things? Am I a kid?

300
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,360
You never think about
me, do you?

301
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,560
After your mother passed away...-
- Please don't say the same thing again.

302
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,120
I am not in the mood.
Please go.

303
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,240
I don't believe this! You
went to Gayetri?!

304
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,240
Sorry...

305
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,280
I didn't know...

306
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,800
I thought it would help you.-
- Chuck it.

307
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,000
Don't tell him I gave
you his number...

308
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,600
Yes, Ma'am, looking for someone?

309
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,040
Yes... he...

310
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,480
He resigned.

311
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,800
None of us know why.
He's unavailable on the phone.

312
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,920
Strange.

313
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Okay.

314
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,440
So you won't go to work
today as well?

315
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,760
No.

316
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
But why?

317
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,520
I don't feel like.

318
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,440
Oh no... where is my phone?

319
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,520
Just give me a call...

320
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,480
Did I drop it in the market?
I can't remember...

321
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,920
Ah... here it is!

322
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,880
Thank God!

323
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,320
It's in my pocket.

324
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,120
Thank you.

325
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,880
Oh, you're here! Hope finding
the house wasn't hard?

326
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,080
No. The driver dropped
me close by.

327
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
Come.

328
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,640
Please come.

329
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,920
This is Binoy'r room.

330
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120
When will Binoy be back?

331
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,960
He left a little while
back. He will be late.

332
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,400
His room is quite untidy, I see.

333
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,240
Yes. He is like that. I've not
been able to teach him this.

334
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,680
He got it from his mother.
Also, he is a quiet person.

335
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,400
Maybe he misses his mother.

336
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,200
But he has you.

337
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,520
Even then.

338
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,680
He's been an emotional kid.

339
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,600
If someone so much as shouted
at him, his eyes welled up.

340
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,800
Anyway. What will you eat?

341
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,280
Only tea. That's all.-
- No way. That won't do.

342
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,560
First time you visited our
house. Just tea won't suffice.

343
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,840
Check out his room. I'll be back.

344
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,560
Oh... he's using a new
phone number now.

345
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,360
I tricked him into giving
me that number.

346
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,360
I'll send you that number.

347
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,720
So...

348
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,960
He left the job. Is that
because of me?

349
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,040
I believe so.

350
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,520
Though he never said anything.

351
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,440
You see...

352
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,600
Bidisha's going away did
affect him gravely.

353
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,720
At least that's what I believe.

354
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,520
Bidisha?

355
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,800
Binoy's mother.-
- Okay.

356
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,680
I could not stop her.

357
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,480
Though...

358
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,760
it's not like I wanted to.

359
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,560
You can't force someone to stay.

360
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,400
How are you, Binoy?

361
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,880
I'm good.

362
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,120
Hey!

363
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,200
Are you okay?

364
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,520
Do you feel sick?

365
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,240
Waiter... get some water!

366
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,960
Thank you. Get me
another glass of water.

367
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,960
Hey!

368
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,880
Fine, I am pretty. But
why is that a problem?

369
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,840
I'm a bit allergic about this.

370
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,840
I'm scared to look
you in the eye.

371
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
It hurts. Can't help it.

372
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,240
Has this allergy been
there since childhood?

373
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,600
I didn't go to a
co-educational school.

374
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,160
Mine was a boys' school.

375
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,040
So... I've no idea.

376
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,920
You see... there is a reason...

377
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,000
why I asked this.

378
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,160
Is there an incident in your past,

379
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,160
which haunts your thoughts?

380
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,479
As in, when you were
7 or 8, or younger...-

381
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,960
I don't have any memories
of my childhood.

382
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,400
No problem. Let's just
leave it.

383
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,400
So, tell me...

384
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,720
do you remember any
of your dreams?

385
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,400
The medical term for
this is 'Venustraphobia'.

386
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,280
A weird disorder. It's common.

387
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,520
Like?

388
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,080
Like, being scared of
beautiful women.

389
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,760
They can't look a pretty woman
in the eye when talking.

390
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,120
Communication is still
possible from distance. But...

391
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,480
a face to face?

392
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,040
Impossible.

393
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,760
Is there a treatment?

394
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,480
There's only one treatment,
Gayetri. That is 'talking cure'.

395
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:38,160
The patient must speak out in
front of the doctor, uninhibited.

396
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,520
But...

397
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,560
this is the problem with Binoy. He
isn't comfortable with me as well.

398
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,000
Why?

399
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,920
Because he feels I am
a pretty looking woman.

400
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,000
What the hell! Though I don't mind
such a compliment as this age.

401
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,560
Good compliment.

402
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,520
Somehow, he can't even
look me in the eye!

403
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,000
What now?

404
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,240
I was thinking, Gayetri...

405
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,640
Why not refer him to
a male doctor?

406
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,520
Maybe he'll be
comfortable with a man?

407
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,720
Another thing is...

408
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,040
You see, I spoke to him twice.
Today was the second session.

409
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,920
I don't know why I feel...

410
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,400
this disorder is rooted
back in his childhood.

411
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,040
An incident from his past...

412
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,640
that he is carrying
with himself subconciously.

413
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,760
Which is getting
manifestated in this way.

414
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,320
Okay... so, Sir will be
back tomorrow.

415
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,040
So, I was thinking... why not
share his case study with Sir.

416
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,160
As a reference.

417
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,400
Yes, Baba is coming
tomorrow in the morning.

418
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,640
Actually!

419
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,280
I just got an idea! I
think I have a solution!

420
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,360
Hello.

421
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,000
You've arrived?

422
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,080
The second floor. Yes,
there's an elevator. Come.

423
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,000
See you.

424
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,720
Baba... best of luck!

425
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,960
Please come.

426
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,920
Please have a seat.

427
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,120
Mahasweta told me about you.

428
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,880
Let's spare the
formalities really.

429
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,600
It's very boring.-
- Sure.

430
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,880
What do you do?

431
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,320
I used to work in a
advertising agency.

432
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
I quit.

433
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
Why?

434
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,840
If you don't feel like,
no need to tell me.

435
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,560
I was facing problems.

436
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,720
I mean, this usually
happens to me.

437
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,640
Who all do you have at home?-
- I and Baba.

438
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,400
Maa?

439
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,640
No.

440
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,920
Okay... sorry to hear that.

441
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
What happened to her?

442
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,600
Have you been in
Kolkata since childhood?

443
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,200
Yes. In the same house
where we live now.

444
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,000
Who do you look like?
Your mother or your father?

445
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,480
Maa.

446
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,520
That's what I get to hear.-
- 'Hear'... as in?

447
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,400
I don't remember my mother.-
- No memory of her?

448
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,720
I do have a red sweater and...

449
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,040
I've been told the mirror
in my room is hers.

450
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,600
When you see yourself in that
mirror, don't you remember her?

451
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,560
Not really. Sometimes I do.

452
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,160
And what do you do then?

453
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,800
I speak to Baba if he's
there or I sleep it off.

454
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,040
Don't you dream of her?

455
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,160
I don't remember my dreams.

456
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,720
That is natural.

457
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,120
Any pictures of her?-
- No.

458
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,200
Can't we talk about
something else?

459
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,880
Surely.

460
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,360
But it is difficult to fathom the
son without the mother, right?

461
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,000
Why? Why is it difficult?

462
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,680
I don't have my mother in my
life. My father brought me up!

463
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,040
She left me.

464
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,880
She didn't take me with her. Never
met me again. Never got back.

465
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,040
Where did she go?

466
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,040
Can I?-
- Sure.

467
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,280
It's okay! You can sit
here and smoke.

468
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,640
No problem.

469
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,760
Maa left Baba.

470
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,320
For Baba's friend.
Uncle Uthpal.

471
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,520
They went to Darjeeling.

472
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,480
She never came back.

473
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,240
This is all I know.

474
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,960
But this is a one-sided story.

475
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,200
Ever heard your mother out? She
may have had things to say.

476
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,520
You don't know that.

477
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,160
Staying upset with her without
knowing that is unfair.

478
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,760
Do you watch films?

479
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,120
Yes... sometimes.

480
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Random.

481
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,040
'Sophie's Choice'... seen it?

482
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,240
Watch it. It's on the
second World War.

483
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Hello?

484
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,640
Yes, Gayetri.

485
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,880
You were right. His problem is
rather rooted in his childhood.

486
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,520
I was right then.

487
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,720
So, what's the next plan?

488
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,400
I think I will try once.

489
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,360
Okay. So... Gayetri...

490
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,000
Will you answer honestly
if I ask you something?

491
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,160
Tell me.

492
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,600
You see,

493
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,480
I've not seen you take so much interest
in anything in the last one year.

494
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,920
The way you are so
interested about your colleague...

495
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,360
What's going on?

496
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,040
I don't know.

497
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,840
I really don't.

498
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,160
I'll talk to you later...

499
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,480
Bye.

500
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,960
Are you going out?

501
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,400
Oh, it's you!

502
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,880
Yes, I have an invitation.
I will be back at night.

503
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,640
Binoy is on the roof.

504
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,680
Please go...

505
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Go!

506
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,240
Listen...

507
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,360
Please see what you can do...

508
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,920
Go!

509
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,200
The lanes of Kolkata are
still as interesting, right?

510
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,920
No need to look at me.
You can look away and talk.

511
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,880
Yes, tell me.

512
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,720
I will.

513
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,680
But not here.

514
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,080
You've to come with me.

515
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,760
Will you?

516
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,600
To me, life is a journey.

517
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,120
A long, long walk.

518
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,080
And it's a search as well.

519
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,440
What are you searching for?

520
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,520
A reason.

521
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,640
Why here?

522
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,480
Kolkata's trams mean a lot to me.

523
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,800
When I came back to Kolkata,
I would despise everything.

524
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,560
I didn't like anything.

525
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,280
So I'd hop onto a tram.

526
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,080
I'd see the entire Kolkata sitting
here. So many kinds of people!

527
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,800
I'd watch them pass by.

528
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,240
Everyone is living it.
They want to! And happily!

529
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,200
Because it's only one life!

530
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,280
Why did you dislike everything?

531
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,080
You disliked meeting me too...

532
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,200
No. It's not exactly that way...

533
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,720
I did like to.

534
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,160
I wanted to. But I couldn't.

535
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,880
I've a similar story.

536
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
Why?

537
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,400
I had reasons. I have reasons.

538
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,920
There are tales that
tell that story.

539
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,560
You won't tell me?

540
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,800
I will.

541
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,200
That is why I brought
you with me.

542
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,880
Can't we talk about
anything else but my mother?

543
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,120
But this is...

544
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,960
My house. And it is
Dr. Sen's house as well.

545
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,200
He is my father.

546
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,240
I know everything about you.

547
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,760
But you don't know
everything about me.

548
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,520
I've something to tell
you today.

549
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,040
I had gone to England
to finish my education.

550
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,200
Bristol.

551
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,960
I met Takashi there.

552
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,880
He was from Japan.

553
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,720
Shy and quiet. Introverted.

554
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,600
We became very close.

555
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,000
And then we fell in love.

556
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,200
We were very happy.

557
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,600
There were no problems.

558
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,400
I wasn't supposed to come to
Kolkata. My parents stay in Delhi.

559
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,440
I was supposed to settle
in London.

560
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,960
Then Takashi went to Japan.

561
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,080
For the holidays.

562
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,360
And one day, suddenly...

563
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,520
I heard...

564
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,600
he had committed suicide.

565
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,960
He left a suicide note too.

566
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,360
But why... what for...

567
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,120
I never got to know.

568
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,240
Without Baba and Mahasweta...

569
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,920
maybe I would've been ruined.

570
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,600
Then I came here. Started afresh.

571
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,400
When I think about
Takashi... even now...

572
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,080
Maybe you are wondering...

573
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,520
why I am telling you all this.

574
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,120
Honestly...

575
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,880
I've never shared this
with anyone.

576
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,440
I think, with you...

577
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,000
I think... maybe,

578
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,720
I feel a deep connection with you.

579
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,760
I don't know if you can
call is a mere liking...

580
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,360
But you too are very shy.

581
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,320
So, I feel scared.

582
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,120
What if I lose you too?

583
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,440
It's so early in the morning...
Is everything alright?

584
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,880
Actually...

585
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,480
I got a promotion at work.
You're the first one I called.

586
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,080
Really!

587
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,880
Congratulations! This
calls for a celebration!

588
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,000
I have to fly to
Mumbai this evening.

589
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,240
They've made me the head
of a national campaign.

590
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,920
You are leaving?

591
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,800
I have to.

592
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,040
Why? You can tell them
you won't go.

593
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,920
You see...

594
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,880
It was I who asked
for the transfer.

595
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,840
How do I refuse now?

596
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,600
Besides, you're coming
with me, right?

597
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:41,400
My flight's at 7 pm. I got
to know last night.

598
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,040
No packing done yet.

599
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,680
Meet me once, if you
can... please! Please!?

600
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,560
You decided to go
all of a sudden...

601
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,640
Is everything alright?

602
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,400
I should've gone long ago.

603
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,880
I thought of going but
never ended up doing so.

604
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,480
I think they live near
Lebong now.

605
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,280
I'll find them, Baba.

606
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,160
When is your train?

607
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,800
Padatik Express. At 11 pm.

608
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,840
I've a photograph of
Bidisha's with me... if you...-

609
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,640
- Keep that with yourself, Baba.

610
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,040
Hello?

611
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,360
You're here?

612
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,680
No. Stand outside the
lane, I'll walk to the car.

613
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,280
See you, Baba.

614
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,240
Hello?

615
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,440
So you're leaving without me?

616
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,800
Your flight?

617
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,320
It left without me.

618
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,440
I'm not going to Mumbai.

619
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,600
Then where are you going?

620
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,000
First, to the railway station.

621
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,120
Then, Darjeeling.

622
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,800
Then Tokyo.

623
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,080
To find answers to the
questions of our past?

624
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,720
Come on then!

625
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,080
Let's go?

626
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,200
You and I?
