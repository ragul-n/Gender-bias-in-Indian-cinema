18
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:54,559
This is Periyasamy.

19
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:58,067
Their entire hereditary has been
into agriculture.

20
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:03,233
This is Papathi, his wife.

21
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,150
This is the eldest son, Aadhinathan.

22
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:15,608
This is their second child, Aathira.

23
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,442
Third child, Aadhipiraan.

24
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:23,275
And this is their youngest,
Aadhi Murthy.

25
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:27,293
Periyasamy lead a happy life.

26
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:32,627
He loved his wife and children
more than his life.

27
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,508
I'm coming, sister.

28
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,187
Are you here for someone?

29
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:49,485
- Sister-
- Welcome, Kaali.

30
00:05:49,586 --> 00:05:51,442
Papathi mentioned that you'll be visiting
this morning,

31
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:52,900
- I was going to.
- Welcome, Kaali.

32
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:55,775
Kaali, over here.

33
00:05:56,483 --> 00:05:57,817
Come on, join us.

34
00:05:57,868 --> 00:05:58,951
Hey, why should I?

35
00:05:58,996 --> 00:06:01,391
Oh, come on,
the premonitions are for you.

36
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:02,775
You never listen.

37
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:03,775
- And you never change.
- Tell me, sister.

38
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:06,900
Kaali, since three days I'm restless
and anxious.

39
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,117
I've been having nightmares.

40
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:12,856
Something similar happened when my father
was about to die.

41
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:16,275
It seemed like he knew his time was up
and he passed.

42
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:17,861
Hey, Kaali.

43
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:20,817
Just to make 50 bucks you've come
all the way.

44
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:24,074
- Shut up.
- Brother, don't be cynical.

45
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:25,834
You can just pay me one rupee,
that's enough.

46
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:28,649
- Oh, just one rupee"One rupee it seems.
- Enough with it.

47
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:30,983
Praise the preceptor!

48
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:32,168
Praise the preceptor!

49
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,408
Praise the preceptor!

50
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:36,170
The words coming out of me
will not be mine.

51
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:37,930
It's the appellation of, the Sivan!

52
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,150
Good or bad.

53
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:40,418
Happiness or sadness.

54
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:41,899
I'll speak the truth.

55
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:43,687
Because it's the appellation of,
the Sivan.

56
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,817
Do you agree to it?
Shall we proceed with it?

57
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:47,922
It's just a rupee, right"
Go ahead!

58
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:56,787
Sister.

59
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,689
In the past ten days...

60
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:02,892
did a baby goat or a calf die?

61
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,126
Yes, a baby goat died.

62
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:12,984
Why did you cut down the
neem tree outside?

63
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:17,303
It was becoming a disturbance,
so he cut it down.

64
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,789
What happened to the deityâ€™s picture
on the wall?

65
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:30,470
Oh, the frame broke,
so I took it down.

66
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:32,609
- Which deity was it?
- Vinayagar!

67
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,406
- Was it on Friday?
- Yes, it was on Friday.

68
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,516
- Sister, Papathi!
- Hold on, I'll be right there.

69
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:43,317
Sister, my child is all alone
at the house. I got to rush.

70
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:45,969
- She's always in a hurry.
- Praise the preceptor!

71
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,645
Kaali, you continue.
And please you follow him.

72
00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:49,610
Working with her
will literally kill me one day.

73
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:53,578
Praise the preceptor!

74
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:06,967
Uncle!

75
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:09,858
With the father's demise,
skill is lost.

76
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:12,192
With mother's demise,
taste is lost.

77
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:16,192
But when the wife dies,
everything is lost.

78
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:17,959
Are you serious?

79
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:22,812
As per the horoscope,
offspring of Saturn is at the 8th sect...

80
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,266
hence sister's life is in danger.

81
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:30,453
Sister! Papathi, sister!

82
00:08:31,942 --> 00:08:33,320
Sir, please come over here.

83
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:35,509
Sir, please come sooner.

84
00:08:38,842 --> 00:08:39,801
Oh, no!

85
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:42,170
Hey, Papathi!

86
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,025
Oh, my god!

87
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:55,497
Papathi!

88
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:01,483
Papathi!

89
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:03,483
Oh, god!

90
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,608
After the death of his wife.

91
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,715
He considered her as his deity.

92
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:17,233
He took a vow of silence,
during full moon, every month.

93
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,201
The entire day,
he won't speak a word to anyone.

94
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:22,069
He won't even drink a drop of water.

95
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:30,137
Periyasamy's children are now settled
in Chennai.

96
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:32,650
Every year no matter where they are,

97
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,650
along with the entire family...

98
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:36,608
they come home for their mother's memorial.

99
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:42,108
Just like every year,
three years ago everyone had gathered.

100
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:45,826
During that time,
Aathira's husband, Margathamani...

101
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,876
was in need of money to start a business.

102
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:53,110
Aadhinathan, signed as guarantor
and helped him get a loan of 50 lakhs.

103
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:57,817
Maragathamani, hasn't paid the principal
nor the interest to date.

104
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:01,067
Aadhinathan, has been paying off
the interest every month.

105
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,262
Please check if I've given you
the right amount.

106
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,067
You've been paying off interest,
as if you had taken the loan.

107
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,942
You don't seem to discuss,
neither you let me talk to them.

108
00:11:09,992 --> 00:11:11,450
Shall I speak to your sister?

109
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:14,443
Hey, I'm having a bad headache as it is.

110
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:17,567
- Stop bickering!
- You only know to shut me up.

111
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:21,105
- That's right sister-in-law,
if not for him paying off the interest...

112
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,817
Aathira's family will be deprived of
basic needs.

113
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:26,168
But her attitude is...

114
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:29,275
In just 6 months,
her family is going to be on the streets.

115
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,275
Wait and watch.

116
00:11:30,326 --> 00:11:31,973
Daughter has started her
first year of college.

117
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:32,983
Let her graduate...

118
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:34,019
- later we can find her a match.
- Brother...

119
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,105
- sister-in-law is going overboard.
- I'll talk to you later.

120
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,400
She's telling everyone if not for you,
my family will starve.

121
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,285
I agree, that we're going through
hardship.

122
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:44,442
The interest you have been paying
for the last year...

123
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:47,919
my husband will return the entire loan amount of
50 lakhs along with the interest.

124
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:50,826
So, it'll be better if you ask your wife
to mind her words.

125
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:53,733
Aathira, she's not such a person.

126
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,233
Don't pay heed to the gossips.

127
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:58,817
Brother, can't you see sister is in pain...

128
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,301
and you're arguing with her.

129
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,215
Brother, your wife has gone overboard.

130
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:05,311
Hey, why are you raising your voice?

131
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,936
Are you in the mood to fight?

132
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,150
Brother, why don't we ask sister-in-law
about it.

133
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:10,817
Hey, I'm annoyed with you to the core

134
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:12,192
Get lost.
Go and rectify the accounts.

135
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,483
Hey, don't dump your anger on him.

136
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,160
How are you so sure that it was
my wife that spoke?

137
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,488
Brother-in-law we have the proof.

138
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:20,819
Listen to the voice message of your wife.

139
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,394
- Aathira's family-
- Listen...

140
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,775
I spoke to your wife in the heat
of the moment.

141
00:12:25,817 --> 00:12:28,598
That doesn't mean she'll record
and create indifference among the family.

142
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,317
- Sister-in-law, that's unnecessary-
- My family has good traits.

143
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:32,480
It was, Chitra, who recorded the message.

144
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:34,817
Brother-in-law, your wife is the reason
for this fight.

145
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:36,150
You're absolutely right.

146
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:38,525
Hey, you're the root cause
for all the problems.

147
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:40,744
It's not important,
if my wife did speak or not.

148
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:42,769
Signing as a guarantor for the loan
of five millions...

149
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:45,486
- is the biggest mistake of my life.
- Oh, really?

150
00:12:45,576 --> 00:12:48,743
Getting married into your family
was my biggest mistake in life.

151
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,769
- Be my guest.
- Oh, no!

152
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:51,615
Brother, are you happy now?

153
00:12:51,762 --> 00:12:54,176
So, this is why your wife has been
bickering about us to everyone.

154
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,692
First, ask your husband to repay the loan
with interest.

155
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:58,465
They're not going to run away
with the money.

156
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:01,715
That fight broke-up the family.

157
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:03,754
How can you talk ill about my family?

158
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:06,384
After that fight...

159
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,212
no one has turned up even for their
mother's memorial.

160
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:14,733
It's been twenty five years,
since Papathi's demise.

161
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,275
Periyasamy believed everyone will
visit this year...

162
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:21,775
and he can sort everyoneâ€™s' differences
and re- unite the family.

163
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:29,358
Tell me, Aadhi.
When are you guys leaving?

164
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,650
Uncle, everyone is busy with work.

165
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:33,480
So, we can't make it this time.

166
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:37,048
Brothers' were hesitant so asked me to
speak to dad.

167
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:38,869
If I speak to him,
he'll get angry.

168
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,750
Can you please speak to him
and explain the situation?

169
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:48,817
Why did you let your children settle
elsewhere?

170
00:13:48,884 --> 00:13:50,884
You should've made them pursue agriculture.

171
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:52,852
They have to eventually come one day.

172
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:56,582
I'll make sure to straighten them out.

173
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,775
Our men has spoken to, Sonamuthu.

174
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,910
It seems even this year,
Periyasamy's children didn't come home.

175
00:14:06,942 --> 00:14:08,483
Why don't we kill Periyasamy?

176
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:11,275
If I had to kill that old man,
I would've done it long ago.

177
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,192
He should stay alive.

178
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:15,863
But no one from his family
should be alive.

179
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:18,977
I have six months until my sentence ends.

180
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,420
If they still don't come back.
Let's wipe out the entire family.

181
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,777
It's already late,
where the hell is, Eeswaran?

182
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:42,879
He's at the cricket tournament.

183
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:44,275
More than us...

184
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:47,353
he's been celebrating Papathi's memorial
in a grandeur manner.

185
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:50,223
There are posters of the tournament
all around...

186
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:54,067
that celebrates Papathi's Memorial.

187
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:57,567
Papathi Amma's 25th Memorial
Rolling Trophy Cricket Tournament.

188
00:14:57,608 --> 00:15:00,559
The teams competing in the finals are...

189
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:03,316
Hey, talking about it won't help.

190
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,098
Fine, why don't you suggest something?

191
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:07,064
You file a complaint,
I'll take care of the rest.

192
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:11,168
Praveen is going to bat for the team,
"Sons of the Soil."

193
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:16,551
To present the trophy to the winners
we have...

194
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:21,025
Mr. Ramamurthy, gracing his presence
along with his beautiful family.

195
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:23,662
That was fantastic bowling.

196
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:25,637
Wow, Praveen took a strike.

197
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:26,691
I think it's a sixer--

198
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:28,608
Oh, no, I believe it's a catch.

199
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,233
Oh, damn, he dropped the catch.

200
00:15:30,317 --> 00:15:32,108
They're running to make runs.

201
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:33,845
Run out!

202
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:36,590
The Sons of the Soil have lost
another wicket.

203
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:37,692
Idiot!

204
00:15:38,358 --> 00:15:42,025
Next batsman is the captain of
Sons of the Soil...

205
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,108
Eeswaran!

206
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:46,733
Now he enters the arena...

207
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:48,900
for the sake of this team's victory,

208
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:52,192
to score more runs and to face
the fast bowling of their opponent,

209
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:53,556
we present you, Eeswaran.

210
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:56,275
He has arrived on the pitch,
as the last batsman.

211
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:59,337
Amongst the cheers and hoots of his fans...

212
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,192
he's going to score runs
and lead his team to victory,

213
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:04,650
he has finally arrived,
our beloved, Eeswaran.

214
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:06,228
"Eeswaran has arrived!"

215
00:16:07,108 --> 00:16:08,733
"Graced with his dexterity."

216
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:11,025
"Boosted teams' power."

217
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,608
"Laid the path to victory!"

218
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:15,900
"Leader has arrived."

219
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,525
"Eeswaran has entered the arena!"

220
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:21,150
"Twirled his dhoti."

221
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,317
"Swung his bat."

222
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,733
"Eeswaran is in the arena!"

223
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,192
"Graced with his dexterity."

224
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:40,775
"Boosted teams' power."

225
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:43,108
"Laid the path to victory!"

226
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,608
"Leader has arrived."

227
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:48,150
"Eeswaran is in the arena!"

228
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:50,358
"Twirled his dhoti."

229
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:55,983
I toiled hard to score 52 runs,
no one appreciated it.

230
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:58,525
He hasn't done anything but everyone is
going crazy about him.

231
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,358
Hey, at least score one run.

232
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,275
They need seven runs from six balls.

233
00:17:03,317 --> 00:17:04,275
Come!

234
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:04,942
Who me?

235
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,483
Yes, you. He's swinging the bat
as if he's Sehwag!

236
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:08,900
We have to score seven from six balls.

237
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:10,650
- You just strike, I'll handle the rest.
- We'll win!

238
00:17:10,692 --> 00:17:12,712
- Fine...
- We'll win!

239
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:14,067
Fine, we'll win!

240
00:17:14,108 --> 00:17:15,483
We'll win!

241
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:18,317
We'll win only if you strike
and let me bat.

242
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:19,525
If not we'll lose!

243
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:21,067
We won't lose. Funny boy!

244
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,108
Please understand my fans' expectations.

245
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,744
Funny boy "I've never seen a team captain
playing last down.

246
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:27,567
- Dude, did you say something?
- At least strike one ball.

247
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:28,317
Oh, okay, okay!

248
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:30,275
Puliyampatti's Bumrah please bowl easy,
so that he can bat.

249
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,767
Eeswaran is about to face
Puliyampatti Bumrah's bowling.

250
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:35,650
We present you the captain of
Sons of the Soil, Eeswaran.

251
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:37,478
The first ball is getting bowled.

252
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:40,993
He missed it.
That was fantastic bowling.

253
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,068
No runs were scored.

254
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:45,608
He's playing the last over like
Kedar Jadhav.

255
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,455
Kutty Puli looks really worried.

256
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,733
Now comes the second ball!

257
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,733
Fantastic bowling!

258
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:54,108
Bumrah, with his fierce bowling...

259
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:56,025
- has startled, Eeswaran.
- Hey, come over here.

260
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:58,650
What the hell, dude.
You've been wasting balls.

261
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:02,650
Dude, I'm observing the debility
in our opponent's bowling.

262
00:18:02,692 --> 00:18:04,283
By the time you realize,
the match would've ended.

263
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,817
All I need is a strike from you,
I'll take care of the rest.

264
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:08,775
I beg of you. Please strike.

265
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:10,317
Never!

266
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:11,658
Check out the crowd.

267
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,861
Everyone is expecting me to strike
the winning shot.

268
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:16,067
Wait and watch, I'm going to win it.

269
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:17,608
We're waiting for the same.

270
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,858
Do something.

271
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,733
Hey, throw the ball to the keeper.

272
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:22,950
- Fantastic bowling!
- Finally he did it...

273
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:24,473
- Kutty Puli is off for a run.
- Run, damn it.

274
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:28,150
- Hey, run damn it.
- Oh, no!

275
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,278
- Bumrah is about to get Kutty Puli out.
- Dude, don't run!

276
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:32,358
Awesome!

277
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:35,608
Kutty Puli managed to hop on
to the greece...

278
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,317
and has saved the honor of his team.

279
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:47,400
Once again, Kutty Puli has proved that
his teams' honor matters the most than his.

280
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,233
- I told you!
- Hey, come over here.

281
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:52,817
Yes.

282
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:55,775
Kutty Puli is angry and is headed to
converse with Eeswaran.

283
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:58,459
Why the hell are you fielding
for their team?

284
00:18:58,657 --> 00:18:59,907
I hope you didn't get hurt.

285
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:01,817
That was a close call, damn it.

286
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,150
Who asked you to start running?

287
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:04,817
I will take care, you go!

288
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:06,900
Now that they need seven runs
from three balls...

289
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:09,549
- Eeswaran is all set face the next ball.
- I'm gonna hit a six.

290
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,025
Mr. Eeswaran, you need to first
open your eyes and look at the ball.

291
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:15,108
I'm getting a glare from the sun.

292
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,419
Sons of the Soil are going to lose.

293
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,723
He's truly a great captain.

294
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:20,988
- They still need seven runs to win.
- Bowl.

295
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:23,161
The fifth ball is charging fiercely.

296
00:19:23,192 --> 00:19:25,278
- Hey, hit the ball, damn it.
- That's a wide.

297
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:26,317
Dude, that was a wide ball.

298
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:28,442
Due to the wide ball...

299
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:32,108
Sons of the Soil, scored a free run.

300
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,317
Once again,
the fifth ball is in motion.

301
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:34,028
That's it!

302
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:36,233
Hey, what an awful bowling.
I'm not able to strike.

303
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,505
I'm getting irritated

304
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:39,321
Why are you getting angry?

305
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,233
Obviously, he's not bowling right,
so that I can strike.

306
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:42,868
It's not in-line with the bat.

307
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,442
Oh, so, you expect him to throw
right at your bat?

308
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:47,817
- Yes.
- You won't make the effort?

309
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:49,733
I have no such habit.

310
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:52,419
- Umpire, do we give baby-cut for batting?
- No!

311
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,358
- Any luck?
- No!

312
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,215
- He said no. Get back to the greece.
- You go and please bowl.

313
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:58,525
Why the hell is he doing yoga now?

314
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:01,567
Except for batting,
he does everything else.

315
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,275
Oh, Lord!

316
00:20:03,317 --> 00:20:05,661
Please save our team from him.

317
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,983
- Last over. Last ball.
- Now I'm ready to face the ball.

318
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,692
The match is getting very exciting.

319
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:18,150
Bumrah, vice captain of Bad Boys,

320
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:22,775
is going to bowl the last ball
that'll bring this match to an end.

321
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:19,168
Hey, that's a catch don't miss it.

322
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:23,608
Sixer!

323
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:29,108
How it is?

324
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:40,150
"Hail Oh 3-eyed Lord Eeswara
Who sustains and liberates humans"

325
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,442
Hey!

326
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,400
Hey, what are you guys doing?

327
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:52,063
- Why are they fighting?
- No idea.

328
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,692
Let's go and find out.

329
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:55,525
Hey, let's go and find out.

330
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,358
Hey, stop fighting!

331
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,025
You can be the opening batsman
next time.

332
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,902
- Don't hit him.
- Why are you fighting within the team?

333
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:05,076
Hold on, why are you guys fighting?

334
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,108
Stop fighting.

335
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:08,185
What the hell is happening out here?

336
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:11,608
- Damn it boys!
- Break his head open.

337
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:13,708
Hey, please listen don't fight.

338
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:14,817
Why the hell are you guys fighting?

339
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:17,442
Hey, back down, stop fighting.

340
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:20,608
Hey, back down, damn it.

341
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,275
- Hey!
- Don't fight guys.

342
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:26,938
Oh, no!

343
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:33,608
Sorry...

344
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:35,600
Officer!

345
00:22:35,692 --> 00:22:38,067
Hey, Chinnarasu,
what is this nonsense?

346
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,857
Sir, hold on, it will be ready soon.

347
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,400
Hey, where is Eeswaran!

348
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:43,900
Is he even planning to come for
the feast or not?

349
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:45,357
He's at the police station.

350
00:22:45,423 --> 00:22:47,048
- Police station?
- Yes.

351
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:48,858
He's at it again.

352
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,608
He's always fighting for the people.

353
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,483
Now who requires his social service?

354
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:55,942
He's not there for someone else.
He slapped a police officer.

355
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:58,349
Oh, Kutty Puli, police has arrested,
Eeswaran is it?

356
00:22:58,381 --> 00:23:01,340
Hey, Valli, why are you getting agitated?

357
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,692
The police officer should be worried now.

358
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:05,355
Sir, Eeswaran is well-known to me.

359
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,567
Don't sass me with recommendation.

360
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:07,692
It might become an issue.

361
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:08,958
Go and just do your job.

362
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,387
Go and file the FIR.

363
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,782
- Hello.
- Vanakkam, sir.

364
00:23:24,358 --> 00:23:26,108
This is Councilor, Pazhanisamy.

365
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,942
I was informed that you've arrested,
Eeswaran.

366
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:31,567
Yes I did. So, what now?

367
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:34,400
Eeswaran, is very close to me.

368
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:36,233
The Minister is very close to me too.

369
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:37,650
Do you wish to speak to him?

370
00:23:37,692 --> 00:23:40,983
As you're new to the posting,
you messed around with the wrong person.

371
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:43,108
When you realize it,
you'll let him go yourself.

372
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,037
Trying to impose political power?

373
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,496
Hang up, damn it!

374
00:23:48,108 --> 00:23:51,442
Just because you're friends with
a handful of politicians...

375
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:53,192
won't make you a big shot.

376
00:23:54,358 --> 00:23:56,608
Welcome brother,
who are you saving at the moment?

377
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,608
- Please have tea.
- Hey, did I ask him to serve tea?

378
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,983
Come over here!

379
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:05,983
Serve the others as well.

380
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,942
Hello, sir.

381
00:24:14,983 --> 00:24:17,442
Sabari, did you arrest, Eeswaran?

382
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:20,333
Yes, sir. He was fighting at the
cricket ground.

383
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,608
I went to stop him and he slapped him.

384
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,400
Moreover, I've filed an FIR.

385
00:24:24,442 --> 00:24:26,358
Sir, I haven't filed an FIR yet.

386
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,025
If FIR is filed,
transfer the case to another accused.

387
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,192
What do I say,
when DSP questions me?

388
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:35,248
DSP will question you.
You better answer to him.

389
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:39,942
Recommendations, my foot.

390
00:24:44,272 --> 00:24:48,106
Hey, who are you?
And what the hell you think of yourself?

391
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:50,900
It's imperative to know the people around,
when you take up the new posting.

392
00:24:50,942 --> 00:24:51,858
- Mani!
- Brother.

393
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,567
I heard you disobeyed
inspectors orders too.

394
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:54,317
Sir-

395
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,733
- Who gave you the power?
- Here you go.

396
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:59,692
Don't be arrogant because
you know the minister.

397
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:01,692
Sir, he was creating problems.

398
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,442
Give the phone to Eeswaran.

399
00:25:03,483 --> 00:25:05,150
Sure, I'll give it to him.

400
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,608
Sir, DSP wants to speak to you.

401
00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:11,733
Hello!

402
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:15,150
Eeswara, why didn't you tell him
about you?

403
00:25:15,192 --> 00:25:18,233
Sir, people may not believe looking at
my appearance.

404
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:20,755
Fine, ignore it.
He's a new kid on the block.

405
00:25:20,817 --> 00:25:22,192
Do you want me to transfer him?

406
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:25,529
You don't have to transfer or dismiss him
from the job.

407
00:25:25,592 --> 00:25:27,426
Fine, put him on the phone.

408
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,525
- Sir.
- Let him go.

409
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:34,567
- Meet me tomorrow at my office.
- Okay, sir.

410
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:36,067
I'll send him right away.

411
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:40,350
- Shall I leave, sir.
- Please!

412
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:46,025
If you don't mind can you please
take this glass off my hand?

413
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:47,983
Thank you.

414
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:50,650
"Here comes our leader!"

415
00:25:50,692 --> 00:25:53,442
"Here comes our leader!"

416
00:25:55,942 --> 00:25:58,817
"Here comes our mighty Thamizan!"

417
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,233
- Hello.
- This is the minister speaking.

418
00:26:01,275 --> 00:26:03,775
- Sir.
- I've never met you.

419
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:05,275
I got you the job,
'cause you were from our clan.

420
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:06,317
But you've humiliated me.

421
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,567
- Sir, I didn't mean to
- What do you think of yourself?

422
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,900
Hey, Eeswaran is out.

423
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:12,192
Hey, why did you get the
trophy out here?

424
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:14,025
Dude, have you forgotten?

425
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:15,310
We have to take a picture.

426
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:16,821
And smear the village with our posters.

427
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:19,317
It's our first historical victory...

428
00:26:19,358 --> 00:26:21,650
- we have to register the memory.
- Fine, we'll get to that later.

429
00:26:21,692 --> 00:26:23,150
Why were you guys fighting
within our team?

430
00:26:23,192 --> 00:26:25,400
Oh, that...
Hey, Kullapaley!

431
00:26:25,442 --> 00:26:26,442
- What is it?
- Here he comes.

432
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:29,608
- Buddy, bless us both.
- Hey, get off my feet.

433
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,525
When did this happen?

434
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:34,275
- They got married during the scuffle.
- Scuffle?

435
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:37,451
It happened under your command.
But you're not aware of it.

436
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:40,025
At least someone should've
informed me about it.

437
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:42,817
If we inform, you'll seek permission from
all the relatives.

438
00:26:42,858 --> 00:26:44,333
Nonsense! Take a picture.

439
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:46,608
- Everyone come closer.
- Smile, dude.

440
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,763
This will be your last smile,
so smile away.

441
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,262
- Constable.
- Sir?

442
00:26:54,724 --> 00:26:56,192
Who the hell is this guy?

443
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:57,900
Even Chief Minister might end up
calling me.

444
00:26:57,942 --> 00:26:59,733
Sir, I was going to warn you.

445
00:26:59,775 --> 00:27:01,025
But you never gave me a chance.

446
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:02,900
Hey, enough of theatrics!

447
00:27:02,942 --> 00:27:04,400
Tell me about him.

448
00:27:04,442 --> 00:27:06,067
Sir, his name is, Eeswaran.

449
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:12,067
Hey, make way!

450
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:14,817
All the VIPs visit the Pazhani temple.

451
00:27:14,858 --> 00:27:17,650
When they visit,
it's Eeswaran who pays respect...

452
00:27:17,692 --> 00:27:20,275
and help them get blessings
from the deity.

453
00:27:20,317 --> 00:27:24,650
Moreover, when their friends or relatives
come down to the temple...

454
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:27,025
they call, Eeswaran to handle
their visits too.

455
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:30,358
The respect with which Eeswaran
took care of the VIPs...

456
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,025
he'll pay the same respect to their
friends and family too.

457
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:38,466
That's how he became popular with
the top-cats and the VIPs.

458
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,442
Hey, pick up the phone.

459
00:27:49,483 --> 00:27:50,942
You're getting a call from
an unknown number.

460
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:52,025
Stop screaming!

461
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,652
- Hello!
- Sir.

462
00:27:55,192 --> 00:27:56,150
- Sir.
- Tell me, sir.

463
00:27:56,192 --> 00:27:57,942
Sir, look to your left.

464
00:27:57,983 --> 00:28:00,108
- Sir, that's my number.
- I'll save it.

465
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,400
I'll call you if I need anything.

466
00:28:01,442 --> 00:28:04,318
Sir, if I need anything,
I'll surely call you.

467
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,400
Sure!

468
00:28:31,192 --> 00:28:32,900
- Guys, come on!
- Come on, run faster.

469
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:34,775
Come on, hurry up!

470
00:28:34,817 --> 00:28:37,692
- Check what they want?
- Sir, I'm getting to it.

471
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:39,858
Hey, Kutty Puli, mix the curry well,
before serving.

472
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,025
Sir, each person is guffing
half a kilo of meat.

473
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:44,108
Here I am. Here I am!

474
00:28:45,775 --> 00:28:47,483
Here I am. Who needs rice?

475
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,192
Here you go, eat well.

476
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:50,108
Eat well!

477
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,317
Please, eat well.

478
00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:52,233
Hey, serve them curry.

479
00:28:52,317 --> 00:28:53,900
There are two vacant seats in the middle.

480
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:55,692
Let's squeeze ourselves into that gap.

481
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:57,317
Here you go.
Eat well.

482
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,275
Eat as much as you wish.

483
00:28:59,358 --> 00:29:02,108
Who else need food"
Come on, tell me.

484
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,650
Have more rice.

485
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:05,150
Hey, Eeswara...

486
00:29:05,192 --> 00:29:07,256
- Hold your horses.
- Did I leave anyone behind?

487
00:29:07,942 --> 00:29:10,025
Eeswara, come over here.

488
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:11,817
Come!

489
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:16,192
You're late for the feast and the rites.

490
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:17,608
Where were you all this while?

491
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,650
But you got the situation under control,
once you got here.

492
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,858
We can always calm them down
if the price is right.

493
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:29,608
Eeswara, I'm wondering why the police
arrested you.

494
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,150
Didn't you do anything about it?

495
00:29:31,192 --> 00:29:32,983
He came, meddled into things...

496
00:29:33,025 --> 00:29:35,275
got angry, and also got slapped,

497
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:39,275
and he kept boasting about himself.

498
00:29:39,317 --> 00:29:42,358
Later he calms down
when a few spoke to him about me.

499
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:44,983
You're full of grit, son.

500
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:48,025
Finally, with much love he gave me
his number and let me go.

501
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:51,567
One who knows what's going to
happen next...

502
00:29:51,608 --> 00:29:53,275
will always remain silent!

503
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:55,858
Oh, no. Someone is asking for curry.

504
00:29:55,942 --> 00:29:57,317
Hey, get them curry.

505
00:29:57,358 --> 00:29:59,483
Keep serving them curry, buddy!

506
00:30:01,942 --> 00:30:03,525
There are only bones in it.

507
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:07,912
Kutty Puli, brother, who is the new chap?

508
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:12,650
You people check out the village
on a video-call from abroad.

509
00:30:12,692 --> 00:30:14,608
Obviously, you wouldn't know
what's happening around.

510
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,275
You don't put an effort to know someone,
is it?

511
00:30:16,317 --> 00:30:19,442
But you jump in immediately for free food.

512
00:30:20,053 --> 00:30:21,399
- Listen, Illango.
- Tell me.

513
00:30:21,442 --> 00:30:24,900
Eeswaran is a distant relative of
brother, Sonamuthu.

514
00:30:24,942 --> 00:30:27,400
I don't think Eeswaran has any family
of his own.

515
00:30:28,317 --> 00:30:30,233
- I believe he's from a poor family.
- Okay.

516
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:34,525
Three years ago, Eeswaran started working
at brother Sonamuthu's shop.

517
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:37,840
You can't find a single soul in this area,
who doesn't know Eeswaran.

518
00:30:38,192 --> 00:30:40,194
He makes the special punch
at the Temples.

519
00:30:40,525 --> 00:30:42,567
And he'll be busy during the festivals.

520
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:43,942
The rest of the time,
he's always with Periyasamy, sir.

521
00:30:43,983 --> 00:30:46,233
- Periyasamy, sir, has been living alone.
- Yes.

522
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:48,733
These past three years,
Eeswaran has been looking after him.

523
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:49,858
He's a wonderful chap.

524
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,608
He's unlike you,
who won't abandon his parents to go abroad.

525
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,900
Brother, I just asked who it was?

526
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:55,442
Why the hell do you need to know?

527
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:56,858
Have your meal and get going.

528
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,900
Enough with the questions.

529
00:30:57,942 --> 00:30:59,858
Do you at least know what is the
occasion?

530
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,525
- I believe, it's ear-piercing ceremony.
- I'm going to whack you!

531
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:04,233
You're at the wrong place, damn it.

532
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:06,275
Hey, he's at the wrong feast.

533
00:31:06,317 --> 00:31:07,817
Don't serve him food.
Take away everything.

534
00:31:07,858 --> 00:31:09,650
Hey, let him have the onions.

535
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:11,584
Come on, lick them clean.

536
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,400
You don't deserve to ask any questions.

537
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:23,483
I thought my children will somehow
make it this time.

538
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:29,428
I was yearning to meet my grand children.

539
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,775
Everyone let me down again.

540
00:31:33,983 --> 00:31:36,858
Sir, let go of the time.
It keeps changing.

541
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:39,098
Hold on to the period,
it'll stay forever.

542
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,192
Eeswara, I get your point...

543
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:47,358
but I don't have much time left.

544
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:51,733
Not sure when my time will be up.

545
00:31:53,275 --> 00:31:57,567
Sir, you always say,
that we should live life in the moment.

546
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,608
Life is interesting only when there are
problems.

547
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,900
Everything is fine.

548
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:05,067
Let me tell you something.

549
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,942
Come closer.

550
00:32:08,881 --> 00:32:10,965
Do you know the trick to make
the 'God' laugh?

551
00:32:12,442 --> 00:32:14,442
It's enough that we tell him our plan.

552
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:15,775
He'll be rolling on the floor laughing.

553
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:17,108
How's that?

554
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,692
A deadly virus, Corona has originated
from Wuhan, China in December...

555
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,608
is rapidly spreading across the world.

556
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,567
170 passengers who have arrived
in India from abroad...

557
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:32,817
have been tested positive.

558
00:32:32,858 --> 00:32:35,525
Prime Minister Modi,
as a measure to curb the virus...

559
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:41,567
has imposed 144 curfew across the nation
for the next twenty one days.

560
00:32:41,608 --> 00:32:46,775
Due to the imposition of 144 curfew,
people remained cooped inside their houses.

561
00:32:47,374 --> 00:32:51,525
The spread of corona virus is increasing
in Tamilnadu by the day.

562
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:57,483
The count of corona positive patients
is 23 at present.

563
00:32:59,402 --> 00:33:00,443
Tell me, dad.

564
00:33:00,483 --> 00:33:04,067
I'm really scared after hearing the news
about the virus.

565
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:07,650
How will you guys survive with the kids
in the city for a month?

566
00:33:07,692 --> 00:33:09,525
Ask everyone to come home.

567
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:13,067
Dad, we did apply for E- pass,
but couldn't get it.

568
00:33:13,108 --> 00:33:15,525
Eeswaran, will make arrangements
for the E- pass.

569
00:33:15,525 --> 00:33:16,942
I'll ask him to talk to you.

570
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,813
You guys get here as soon as possible.

571
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:28,442
- Brother.
- Tell me, Eeswara.

572
00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:30,192
Where have you reached?

573
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:32,233
We crossed Manaparai,
should be there soon.

574
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:33,233
- Is that so?
- Yes.

575
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:34,525
Okay, you guys come safe.

576
00:33:35,118 --> 00:33:38,576
Come on, folks, follow my car!

577
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:42,775
Soon I'm going to win over this world.

578
00:33:42,806 --> 00:33:45,098
Come on, folks...

579
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,733
They left at seven in the evening
from Chennai.

580
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:51,692
They haven't reached yet.
But I'm already here.

581
00:33:51,723 --> 00:33:54,473
I wonder where have the sloths reached.

582
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:00,233
Let's find out.

583
00:34:00,942 --> 00:34:01,900
Tell me, dad.

584
00:34:01,921 --> 00:34:05,317
Hello, dear, where is your mother?

585
00:34:05,317 --> 00:34:06,942
Mom is sleeping.

586
00:34:06,983 --> 00:34:08,358
What about your sisters?

587
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,525
Both the sisters are sleeping.

588
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:11,942
Oh, is it.

589
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,942
Do you know where have you reached?

590
00:34:13,983 --> 00:34:15,608
Dad, hang up, I'm watching a movie.

591
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:18,347
I'm asking, because
I've already reached-

592
00:34:20,001 --> 00:34:22,334
Dude, what's happening to him?

593
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:25,567
How come Eeswaran is all decked up
so early in the morning?

594
00:34:25,608 --> 00:34:27,288
It's 'cause his girlfriend is coming.

595
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:29,900
Who is Eeswaran's girlfriend?

596
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,400
- She's Periyasamy sir's grand daughter.
- Boss' grand daughter?

597
00:34:32,443 --> 00:34:34,402
Three years ago she was here
for the carnival.

598
00:34:34,428 --> 00:34:37,803
That's when we found out,
that they're in love.

599
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:43,561
The entire family of Periyasamy, sir,
attended the carnival.

600
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:59,817
"Oh, dear God! You help all the people
of our land prosper"

601
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:07,554
"We always trust you.
Take us forward in our life!"

602
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:10,834
"We offer our prayers to you..."

603
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:16,483
"drive away the evils engulfing us."

604
00:35:16,765 --> 00:35:21,025
"We will dance to your tune."

605
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:26,400
"Please save us till the end."

606
00:35:26,633 --> 00:35:29,091
"Here comes our leader!"

607
00:35:29,134 --> 00:35:31,717
"Here comes our leader!"

608
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:34,358
"Here comes our mighty Thamizan!"

609
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,942
"Here comes our mighty Thamizan!"

610
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:39,608
"Whatever we planted
have blossomed as flowers"

611
00:35:39,608 --> 00:35:40,817
"Surprising the whole country"

612
00:35:40,858 --> 00:35:42,192
"now has reason to celebrate.
Good days are here"

613
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:44,817
"Kumkum and sandal paste smeared
all over our forehead"

614
00:35:44,817 --> 00:35:47,483
"People crushed to the earth
have touched the sky today"

615
00:35:47,483 --> 00:35:52,608
"Our Tamilnadu lacks nothing.
Why do you have to go abroad?"

616
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,275
"If you sow in our soil"

617
00:35:55,317 --> 00:35:57,775
"It will give you back in abundance"

618
00:35:57,817 --> 00:36:00,567
"Thamizh is the language we speak"

619
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:03,108
"Our relatives here love us
with their lives"

620
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,442
"Don't get perturbed sitting in the dark"

621
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:08,150
"Don't fear the people who suppress you"

622
00:36:08,192 --> 00:36:10,733
"The mighty Tamizhan has arrived"

623
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:13,410
"He's going to re-write the history!"

624
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:16,067
"The mighty Tamizhan has arrived"

625
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:18,900
"He's going to re-write the history!"

626
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:21,286
"The mighty Tamizhan has arrived"

627
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,767
"He's going to re-write the history!"

628
00:36:23,816 --> 00:36:26,399
"The mighty Tamizhan has arrived"

629
00:36:26,483 --> 00:36:29,358
"He's going to re-write the history!"

630
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,067
"Whatever we planted have
blossomed as flowers"

631
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,192
"Surprising the whole country"

632
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,525
"now has reason to celebrate.
Good days are here"

633
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:37,275
"Kumkum and sandal paste smeared
all over our forehead"

634
00:36:37,317 --> 00:36:39,858
"People crushed to the earth
have touched the sky today"

635
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:45,108
"Our Tamilnadu lacks nothing.
Why do you have to go abroad?"

636
00:36:45,192 --> 00:36:47,775
"If you sow in our soil"

637
00:36:47,817 --> 00:36:50,567
"It will give you back in abundance"

638
00:37:35,009 --> 00:37:37,592
"King of kings stood their ground"

639
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:41,400
"Having faith asked us to fight
with Valor to save our pride"

640
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:48,095
"You forgot your land of birth
and departed looking for livelihood"

641
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,733
"You left our land barren
just to live in the hell"

642
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:53,317
"Respect your soil,
you'll grow multi-fold"

643
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:55,942
"You will laugh till the end"

644
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:58,317
"With our lord Murugan standing by you"

645
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,233
"You will harvest the grains
yielded by our soil"

646
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:10,900
"Oh, dear God! You help all the people
of our land prosper"

647
00:38:30,334 --> 00:38:32,168
So, that's how it happened.

648
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,001
So, he's eager to meet his girlfriend.

649
00:38:34,025 --> 00:38:35,942
It's ex-girlfriend to be precise.

650
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:37,025
They broke up, right away.

651
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:40,358
More than the lovers,
I'm scared standing guard for them.

652
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,577
Eeswaran, told her that Periyasamy sir
is important to him.

653
00:38:42,608 --> 00:38:45,897
And he can't leave him alone or
is willing to leave this village.

654
00:38:46,415 --> 00:38:48,748
And that hurt Vasuki's ego a lot.

655
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:54,400
Generally, women expect their boyfriends
to make them as priority.

656
00:38:55,025 --> 00:38:57,858
So, Vasuki couldn't take it.

657
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,317
So, in a fit of ego she broke up with him.

658
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:04,472
Later she got married to someone else
and settled in life.

659
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:08,525
Agreed that she's married.
But he must still have feelings for her.

660
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:12,067
Obviously, that's why he's torturing us
along with him.

661
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:25,525
- Hey, Eeshwar uncle!
- Kids, watch your step.

662
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:27,483
Eeshwar, uncle!

663
00:39:31,525 --> 00:39:33,150
Hello kids!

664
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:34,858
How are you, Eeshwaran, uncle?

665
00:39:34,942 --> 00:39:37,317
The car is out there,
get inside it.

666
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:39,317
- Get inside the car.
- Hey, awesome!

667
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:40,442
We'll follow your car, Eeswara.

668
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:43,358
Brother, a minute please.
We're taking a shortcut.

669
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,692
- Tell me, Eeswara.
- I've never see him, before.

670
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:46,942
He's my wife's relative.

671
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:48,900
- He's been working for me.
- That's great.

672
00:39:48,942 --> 00:39:49,858
- Please follow my vehicle.
- Okay.

673
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,358
- You get inside.
- Sure, Eeswara, we'll follow.

674
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,567
Start the vehicle.

675
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:15,567
Hey, grandpa!

676
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,733
- Watch your step, dear.
- Vanakkam, brother.

677
00:40:45,775 --> 00:40:47,775
- Vanakkam, how are you?
- I'm doing well.

678
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,567
Carry on, folks.

679
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,567
Come on, hurry up.

680
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,317
Hello, Mams!

681
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:03,567
Hello!

682
00:41:06,543 --> 00:41:07,543
How are you, mams?

683
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:10,525
- Vasuki, where is your husband?
- He went to Dubai on business.

684
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:12,692
Due to Corona, he's stuck over there.

685
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:13,983
Oh, is it?

686
00:41:34,903 --> 00:41:38,361
Aathira, I've been stopped at
Dindigul's check post.

687
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,983
I told you to come along with us.

688
00:41:41,025 --> 00:41:42,150
But you never listened.

689
00:41:42,775 --> 00:41:45,733
You were showing off too much
about the MLA pass.

690
00:41:45,775 --> 00:41:46,942
What happened to it?

691
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:50,126
I have the E- pass, but it's expired.

692
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,025
Don't you have any sense to check
the expiration date?

693
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,775
Why are we arguing for no reason?

694
00:41:54,817 --> 00:41:55,942
It's not important at the moment.

695
00:41:55,942 --> 00:41:57,858
Please ask Eeswaran to help me out.

696
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,067
Fine, hang up.
I'll sort something out.

697
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:00,820
Okay.

698
00:42:01,567 --> 00:42:02,775
What is the issue?

699
00:42:02,817 --> 00:42:04,233
Sir, I won't get inside.

700
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:06,525
I came by Breeza, and you expect me
to step into the ambulance.

701
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:08,900
- Sir!
- Who is Maragathamani?

702
00:42:10,067 --> 00:42:12,275
- Oh, so you are, Maragathamani.
- Yes, sir.

703
00:42:12,317 --> 00:42:13,817
- Are you related to Eeswaran?
- Yes.

704
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:15,983
- Why didn't you mention it?
- Before I could...

705
00:42:16,023 --> 00:42:17,733
Go and get on to that vehicle.

706
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:18,775
Watch your steps.

707
00:42:18,817 --> 00:42:21,233
- Thanks a lot Eeswara
- Welcome, brother.

708
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:22,900
Climb on to the back of the vehicle.

709
00:42:22,942 --> 00:42:23,900
- You mean this vehicle?
- Yes.

710
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:26,025
I'll follow you guys in my car.

711
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:27,483
There are three more
check posts to cross,

712
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:28,733
you'll be once again caught
by the police.

713
00:42:28,775 --> 00:42:31,692
- This vehicle is your safe bet.
- I'm not cattle, I can't do it.

714
00:42:31,692 --> 00:42:33,650
- Inspector!
- Sir, I called to thank you.

715
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,900
Thanks a lot. I'm leaving.

716
00:42:34,942 --> 00:42:35,858
Get going.

717
00:42:35,858 --> 00:42:38,775
I own an expensive car,
but stuck traveling in this junk.

718
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:49,817
My face is not meant to be peed on.

719
00:42:52,483 --> 00:42:54,233
It's so salty.

720
00:42:58,608 --> 00:43:01,733
You guys don't seem to realize my worth.

721
00:43:03,858 --> 00:43:05,400
This place looks familiar.

722
00:43:05,442 --> 00:43:07,692
Oh, no, we have arrived.

723
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:09,608
Uncle, please stop the vehicle.

724
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,400
Folks won't respect me,
if they see me arrive with the cattle.

725
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:14,108
Hey, Kutty Puli, help uncle get down.

726
00:43:14,108 --> 00:43:14,900
Please help me.

727
00:43:14,942 --> 00:43:17,692
What is cow doing among the goats?

728
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:21,723
It's not fair to ill treat
a future millionaire.

729
00:43:21,942 --> 00:43:23,275
Why is your shirt all wet?

730
00:43:23,317 --> 00:43:24,650
Don't you know how to drink water?

731
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,483
That's not water, it is goat's urine.

732
00:43:26,525 --> 00:43:27,900
If you were thirsty
should've asked for water.

733
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:29,775
Why did you drink goat's urine?

734
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:31,650
Please don't eat goat dung,
'cause you got hungry.

735
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,817
They've cooked meat at home.

736
00:43:32,851 --> 00:43:35,025
As it is there's shortage of goat dung
for manure.

737
00:43:35,056 --> 00:43:36,556
He's incorrigible.

738
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:40,602
Phew, they should've built an elevator
for this vehicle.

739
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,900
Hey, Kutty Puli!

740
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:47,459
Brother-in-law, please get inside.

741
00:43:47,483 --> 00:43:50,192
Damn, you guys had my car
all this while...

742
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:53,942
but you made ride along with the cattle.

743
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,548
Who gave you the right to
drive my car?

744
00:43:55,817 --> 00:43:57,733
- I only know to ride a bike.
- What?

745
00:43:57,775 --> 00:43:58,858
I swear!

746
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,275
I had a wish to drive a car...

747
00:44:00,275 --> 00:44:01,942
and got that wish fulfilled
by driving you car.

748
00:44:01,983 --> 00:44:04,317
If you get inside,
I'll learn to drive with a pillion rider.

749
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:06,067
Okay, tell me,
which is brake and which is the clutch?

750
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:07,275
The one next to the clutch- -

751
00:44:07,275 --> 00:44:08,525
- Hey!
- Which one is clutch?

752
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:11,067
You were driving all along,
without knowing which one is the brake?

753
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:12,983
Just like how you've been
living your life without a purpose.

754
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,775
If hadn't known,
I wouldn't have fathered three kids.

755
00:44:14,817 --> 00:44:16,608
- How would I know?
- As far as my wife knows.

756
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,442
You get out of the car.

757
00:44:17,442 --> 00:44:19,900
If you don't get inside,
I'll tell everyone you had goat's urine.

758
00:44:19,942 --> 00:44:22,025
Kutty Puli, have you seen
anyone drinking the goat's urine?

759
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:23,483
Why the hell are you
blackmailing me?

760
00:44:23,525 --> 00:44:25,233
Can't believe that you're blackmailing me.

761
00:44:25,275 --> 00:44:27,733
Don't touch me with
your dirty hands.

762
00:44:28,692 --> 00:44:30,400
It'll be embarrassing,
if father-in-law sees me in this state.

763
00:44:30,438 --> 00:44:31,730
I'll manage though.

764
00:44:34,243 --> 00:44:36,160
I should make sure no one
sees me coming.

765
00:44:36,192 --> 00:44:38,317
Oh, no, the herd of monkeys
is out front.

766
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:41,483
Why can't they just rest
after the long travel?

767
00:44:42,173 --> 00:44:44,756
What are they doing out here?
Fine, let me get pass them.

768
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:48,692
- Hey, uncle has arrived.
- Damn, they spotted me.

769
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:50,900
Listen kids, don't touch me.

770
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:54,067
- Do you have chocolates in your pocket?
- What do you want, dear?

771
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:56,692
- Is it inside your bag?
- The bag is inside the car.

772
00:44:56,733 --> 00:44:59,900
Yikes, that's goat dung!

773
00:44:59,942 --> 00:45:02,150
That's goat dung!

774
00:45:02,192 --> 00:45:05,358
Hey, brother-in-law!

775
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,775
You were showing as if you were coming
by a private jet.

776
00:45:07,817 --> 00:45:09,233
But I see your pockets are filled
with goat dung.

777
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:11,733
It's goat dung manure just like
earthworms manure.

778
00:45:11,733 --> 00:45:13,192
- It's a million dollar project.
- To hell with you.

779
00:45:13,233 --> 00:45:14,400
First go and take a bath.

780
00:45:14,442 --> 00:45:17,541
Traveled in a herd carrier but showing off
as if he arrived in an Audi.

781
00:45:24,942 --> 00:45:26,317
Fine, I'll inform him.

782
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:29,650
Brother-in-law.

783
00:45:40,918 --> 00:45:43,793
The entire family has gathered
at the village.

784
00:45:43,817 --> 00:45:46,150
Ask Kannan to get me out on bail.

785
00:45:46,174 --> 00:45:47,983
We'll destroy the entire family.

786
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:51,150
- Hey, bring me idlis.
- Grandpa, please tell us the story.

787
00:45:51,192 --> 00:45:53,916
Kids, do you know what your
fathers' used to do...

788
00:45:53,942 --> 00:45:56,150
We made meat only on Sundays.

789
00:45:56,192 --> 00:45:56,733
Okay.

790
00:45:56,775 --> 00:46:00,861
On that day to have that idli and meat...

791
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,067
they'll be drooling all over
fighting for it.

792
00:46:03,108 --> 00:46:07,182
They haven't changed a bit.
Only the drooling is missing.

793
00:46:07,233 --> 00:46:09,650
I'm way better than these guys...

794
00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:14,025
this guy here,
used to eat off my share too.

795
00:46:14,067 --> 00:46:16,358
I only used to steal his share of meat.

796
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,817
But mom used to secretly feed him
liver fry.

797
00:46:19,858 --> 00:46:21,650
And he used to hide and eat it.

798
00:46:21,692 --> 00:46:22,483
Brother, give me the curry.

799
00:46:22,525 --> 00:46:25,025
To top it all, after everyone
is done with their meal...

800
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:28,900
mom used to mix rice with the
leftover curry from the pot,

801
00:46:28,942 --> 00:46:31,692
and feed us all.

802
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:35,650
I haven't eaten anything to date
that tops that taste.

803
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:38,692
I'm already salivating,
let me add two idlis to my plate.

804
00:46:48,983 --> 00:46:51,067
It's wrong to look at someone else' wife.

805
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,442
It's wrong to marry
someone else' girlfriend too.

806
00:46:53,858 --> 00:46:55,067
This logic is new to me.

807
00:46:55,793 --> 00:46:57,876
The guy who married her...

808
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,903
should've asked her if she had a
boyfriend before marriage.

809
00:47:00,942 --> 00:47:03,233
He didn't ask, so that's on him.

810
00:47:03,275 --> 00:47:05,567
Hey, mams, I need to talk to you.

811
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:09,275
It'll be better if you sit down and talk.

812
00:47:10,326 --> 00:47:12,868
These women won't spare him,
even if he decides to back off.

813
00:47:13,192 --> 00:47:14,442
He's currently in break- up mood.

814
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:16,483
- They're going to spoil it again.
- Don't sit too close to me.

815
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:17,364
No.

816
00:47:18,082 --> 00:47:19,623
Fine, I'll move away.

817
00:47:21,488 --> 00:47:23,708
I was just standing guard,
and I couldn't take it.

818
00:47:23,991 --> 00:47:26,286
You loved her,
and I don't know how you could take it?

819
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:28,031
What do you want me to do
about it?

820
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:29,858
We have to teach her a lesson.

821
00:47:30,574 --> 00:47:31,782
We should avert her.

822
00:47:32,692 --> 00:47:36,872
I can't bear the fact that she deceived you
and is living happily.

823
00:47:37,817 --> 00:47:39,358
I believe we should avenge her.

824
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,896
And I'm the scapegoat to you.

825
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:46,146
Mams, I'm going to fall
in love with you.

826
00:47:46,192 --> 00:47:46,942
Oh!

827
00:47:46,983 --> 00:47:48,560
- I'm going to avert her.
- Oh- oh!

828
00:47:48,608 --> 00:47:50,358
- Just an information.
- Oh- oh- oh!

829
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,400
- Not a permission.
- Awesome!

830
00:47:53,025 --> 00:47:53,942
Baby!

831
00:47:54,108 --> 00:47:55,052
Cutie!

832
00:47:55,483 --> 00:47:58,700
Baby. Why are you feeling
so shy, mams?

833
00:47:59,025 --> 00:47:59,983
Bye.

834
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,233
Finish the work before the sunset.

835
00:48:10,275 --> 00:48:13,858
Hey, Chinnarasu, work briskly.

836
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,025
Tell me, Aathira.

837
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,060
What is the matter?

838
00:48:17,108 --> 00:48:20,900
Dad, he wanted to talk to you
about something.

839
00:48:20,942 --> 00:48:24,150
Hey, Aathira you tell him yourself.

840
00:48:25,317 --> 00:48:27,108
Tell me, dear.

841
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:31,358
Dad, he incurred a huge loss in business.

842
00:48:31,795 --> 00:48:34,920
He couldn't return the money that
he borrowed from brother.

843
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,996
Sister-in-law is acting indifferently.

844
00:48:38,227 --> 00:48:40,560
That's why, if this farm could be--

845
00:48:40,608 --> 00:48:41,567
Aathira!

846
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:46,193
No one should come to me asking to
sell or buy this farm.

847
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,900
One of the clients is offering a huge sum
of money to build a college over here.

848
00:48:49,942 --> 00:48:51,275
Ten crores!

849
00:48:51,317 --> 00:48:54,427
If you miss this offer, you won't even get
half of what they're offering now.

850
00:48:54,483 --> 00:48:55,733
Listen closely...

851
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:59,903
I've drawn a new will
three months ago.

852
00:49:00,108 --> 00:49:02,817
No one has the right to sell or buy
this farm.

853
00:49:03,285 --> 00:49:04,867
You can enjoy its produce.

854
00:49:05,278 --> 00:49:08,317
Until the descendants of
Periyasamy exists...

855
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:11,036
and until the earth exists,
this will remain as it is.

856
00:49:12,775 --> 00:49:17,067
Hereafter, no one in this family should
speak to me about the inheritance.

857
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:29,116
Sign it.

858
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:56,090
How are you, partner?

859
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,665
Where is Periyasami's family?

860
00:50:03,256 --> 00:50:05,797
It's Azhaguarasan daughter's baby shower.

861
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:08,089
The entire family has gathered
out there.

862
00:50:32,256 --> 00:50:35,297
Instead of conducting the the party,
what are you guys doing out here?

863
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:37,297
- Get over there.
- Come on, get inside.

864
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:41,875
- Partner, start the show.
- Folks of Kanakkampatti...

865
00:50:41,922 --> 00:50:45,172
this is an important warning
from Mayakannan.

866
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,589
Hey, who is this clown?

867
00:50:46,631 --> 00:50:48,256
To the folks of Chennai...

868
00:50:48,297 --> 00:50:49,256
Where did he come from?

869
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:51,922
...after many obstacles,

870
00:50:51,964 --> 00:50:55,422
they've arrived at our village for solace.

871
00:50:55,464 --> 00:50:56,547
Welcome, partner.

872
00:50:57,159 --> 00:51:00,659
- Hello, brother-in-law.
- Exchanging pleasantries...

873
00:51:00,714 --> 00:51:05,631
they'll try to rekindle the
relationship with us.

874
00:51:05,631 --> 00:51:06,631
- He's talking about us.
- Arrogant, fellow.

875
00:51:06,672 --> 00:51:09,547
Looks like you people smuggled yourselves
into the village.

876
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:12,881
Trying to re-kindle relationships, is it?

877
00:51:12,922 --> 00:51:14,506
Don't you ever come to our village.

878
00:51:15,047 --> 00:51:15,631
Get lost!

879
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:17,797
Hey, it's a warning.
"Social Distancing!"

880
00:51:18,506 --> 00:51:21,089
We won't let the city folks win.

881
00:51:23,398 --> 00:51:26,107
They're being coy with the drink.
Do you think it's liquor?

882
00:51:26,131 --> 00:51:27,964
Hey, we tired a lot during the lock-down.

883
00:51:28,006 --> 00:51:30,589
The councilor itself couldn't get it.
It's impossible for them to get it.

884
00:51:30,631 --> 00:51:33,006
They're from Chennai,
must've made some arrangements.

885
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,089
What are they pondering about?

886
00:51:35,131 --> 00:51:36,339
Hey, what are you doing?

887
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:38,297
You crooks!

888
00:51:38,297 --> 00:51:39,506
Dude, they're having liquor.

889
00:51:39,547 --> 00:51:41,256
- Hey, are you sure?
- Shall we join them?

890
00:51:41,256 --> 00:51:43,089
- Shall we?
- Yes, let's go!

891
00:51:43,131 --> 00:51:45,422
- Brother!
- Weren't you sarcastic a while ago?

892
00:51:45,464 --> 00:51:49,964
Brother, the doctor had asked me to
check my voice.

893
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,256
That's why I was screaming.

894
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:52,768
- Yeah, right.
- You misunderstood.

895
00:51:53,506 --> 00:51:55,797
Brother, no matter which country
you come from...

896
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,422
you belong to this soil.

897
00:51:59,589 --> 00:52:00,922
Liquor has brought out the love in them.

898
00:52:00,964 --> 00:52:04,214
- He's going to finish it off.
- Hey, hold your horses.

899
00:52:04,797 --> 00:52:07,297
- Give them a drink. He's annoying me.
- Have patience.

900
00:52:07,797 --> 00:52:09,631
Brother, come on, drink.

901
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:12,464
Have some chips.

902
00:52:12,506 --> 00:52:14,506
- I'll have during the next round.
- You're such a sweetheart.

903
00:52:14,547 --> 00:52:16,339
Just wait and watch, I'll do it.

904
00:52:18,631 --> 00:52:20,922
- Hello.
- Am I speaking to Mayakannan?

905
00:52:21,881 --> 00:52:25,047
You, Selva and Dhanasekar have been
tested positive for Corona.

906
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:27,381
Please quarantine yourselves
for fourteen days.

907
00:52:27,964 --> 00:52:30,547
You shouldn't step outside the house. Okay?

908
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:31,857
- Hello, Mayakannan. Hello?
- Brother...

909
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:32,547
Hello.

910
00:52:32,586 --> 00:52:33,461
Brother!

911
00:52:33,922 --> 00:52:37,214
Earlier the ads used to play over the phone
when we make the call.

912
00:52:37,256 --> 00:52:39,589
But now, they're calling us...

913
00:52:39,631 --> 00:52:44,047
and telling we're tested positive
and to quarantine ourselves.

914
00:52:44,089 --> 00:52:47,672
They're trying to separate us.
And that's not going to happen.

915
00:52:47,714 --> 00:52:48,797
You're a sweetheart.

916
00:52:50,381 --> 00:52:52,589
Come on, let's do one thing.

917
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:55,547
- We'll take a selfie and send it to them.
- Sure!

918
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,714
That's an awesome picture.

919
00:53:03,131 --> 00:53:04,422
Sister, look over there.

920
00:53:06,214 --> 00:53:07,131
Why is Poonkodi...?

921
00:53:07,172 --> 00:53:08,548
Mams, step side for a moment.

922
00:53:08,773 --> 00:53:09,690
I'll come later.

923
00:53:09,714 --> 00:53:11,339
- Hey, come with me.
- What is it?

924
00:53:11,381 --> 00:53:12,876
- I'll explain later.
- Get lost.

925
00:53:13,172 --> 00:53:14,422
I said come.

926
00:53:19,422 --> 00:53:21,714
- What is it?
- My sister is heading this way.

927
00:53:21,756 --> 00:53:23,756
Let's put an act that we're intimate
with each other.

928
00:53:23,797 --> 00:53:26,506
- Okay, mams?
- I can't act being intimate!

929
00:53:26,545 --> 00:53:27,961
A bit of social distancing?

930
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:31,362
Eeswara, our control should be
in our own hands.

931
00:53:31,386 --> 00:53:33,178
But my hands have no control.

932
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,589
- Get lost.
- Get lost, uh?

933
00:53:38,631 --> 00:53:40,814
She gave kisses in air,
and asking me to get lost?

934
00:53:42,388 --> 00:53:43,993
What were you doing with my sister?

935
00:53:45,797 --> 00:53:48,547
Don't repeat the same antics
like you did with me.

936
00:53:48,589 --> 00:53:49,339
Understood?

937
00:53:49,381 --> 00:53:51,964
Your sister is doing the same,
what you did to me.

938
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:53,462
You better go and ask your sister.

939
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:56,214
The entire family is alike.

940
00:54:24,023 --> 00:54:25,982
Listen, bring the kids.
The water supply is about to start.

941
00:54:26,006 --> 00:54:28,172
- Welcome, uncle.
- Hello, son.

942
00:54:28,214 --> 00:54:30,006
- What brings you here"How are you?
- Nothing much.

943
00:54:30,037 --> 00:54:31,412
I'm doing well, son.

944
00:54:31,672 --> 00:54:32,714
Where is your father?

945
00:54:32,756 --> 00:54:34,964
- He had called for me.
- He's out for his morning walk.

946
00:54:35,006 --> 00:54:35,922
Please come.

947
00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:40,964
Hey, what happened?

948
00:54:44,297 --> 00:54:46,131
- What happened?
- It was a lizard, uncle.

949
00:54:46,131 --> 00:54:48,922
- You broke the mirror.
- Oh, lizard. I thought it was a snake.

950
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:51,672
Be careful, you might hurt yourself.

951
00:54:51,672 --> 00:54:52,589
Be careful.

952
00:54:57,089 --> 00:55:00,881
- Tell me, Aathira.
- Dad, astrologer Kaali is here.

953
00:55:00,904 --> 00:55:03,612
Yes, I did ask him to come.
But forgot about it.

954
00:55:03,922 --> 00:55:06,547
Please serve him well until I get there.

955
00:55:06,589 --> 00:55:08,116
- Okay, dad.
- I'll be there soon.

956
00:55:09,756 --> 00:55:10,672
Hey!

957
00:55:14,984 --> 00:55:17,526
Hey, what the hell?

958
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,214
You moron!

959
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:22,545
Are you drunk and out of your senses?

960
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:27,922
I wonder who approved your
driving license.

961
00:55:38,589 --> 00:55:42,006
- Eeswara, don't blab about the incident.
- Okay.

962
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,464
They might get scared.

963
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,881
If money was important to me,
I would've done a lot more.

964
00:55:46,547 --> 00:55:48,131
- Uncle is here.
- Hello, Kaali.

965
00:55:48,172 --> 00:55:48,714
Uncle.

966
00:55:48,714 --> 00:55:51,172
I totally forgot that you're coming.

967
00:55:51,172 --> 00:55:53,339
- Not an issue.
- Were you waiting for long?

968
00:55:53,381 --> 00:55:54,131
I just got here.

969
00:55:54,172 --> 00:55:55,506
- Aathira!
- Tell me, dad.

970
00:55:55,547 --> 00:55:57,714
- Can you please get me some water?
- Sure, dad.

971
00:55:57,737 --> 00:56:00,779
Uncle, shall we check out the premonitions?

972
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:03,737
One rupee!

973
00:56:05,881 --> 00:56:08,999
- You haven't changed.
- So, it's one rupee all along.

974
00:56:20,756 --> 00:56:22,547
In the past ten days...

975
00:56:22,577 --> 00:56:26,481
did anyone happen to kill a cobra
within the compound of this house?

976
00:56:28,297 --> 00:56:29,923
Nothing as such happened.

977
00:56:30,445 --> 00:56:31,584
He's right, sir.

978
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,339
Four days ago, I killed a cobra.

979
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:37,412
Have you gone mad?

980
00:56:37,453 --> 00:56:40,142
It was in the vicinity of the kids,
so I killed it.

981
00:56:42,964 --> 00:56:44,545
Recently at this house...

982
00:56:45,339 --> 00:56:48,435
a calf might've born dead,
or would've died after the birth.

983
00:56:48,491 --> 00:56:49,325
You're right.

984
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,690
Did freshly milked milk got spoilt
right away when boiled?

985
00:56:55,714 --> 00:56:58,922
It did, because the vessel was not clean.

986
00:56:58,953 --> 00:57:00,328
Did it get spoilt or not?

987
00:57:01,256 --> 00:57:02,297
It did, uncle.

988
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:04,378
Just reply, yes or no!

989
00:57:14,256 --> 00:57:16,107
Can you people please step outside?

990
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:23,420
Eeswara, stop right there.

991
00:57:24,714 --> 00:57:26,021
Just you, stay back.

992
00:57:26,714 --> 00:57:30,435
One of the women of this house
must've conceived a child.

993
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:36,701
I don't think so, uncle.

994
00:57:37,422 --> 00:57:40,462
No, someone has conceived a child!

995
00:57:44,589 --> 00:57:46,631
- Listen!
- Mom, please don't tell him.

996
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,089
- What is it?
- It's her who is pregnant.

997
00:57:49,631 --> 00:57:51,714
- What?
- I only knew about it today.

998
00:57:51,756 --> 00:57:53,310
Are you freaking' serious?

999
00:57:55,172 --> 00:57:57,006
- Hey!
- Don't hurt her.

1000
00:57:57,047 --> 00:57:59,297
- Brother, don't do it.
- Who is he?

1001
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:01,172
- Who betrayed you?
- Don't hurt her.

1002
00:58:01,214 --> 00:58:02,672
What the hell have you done?

1003
00:58:02,714 --> 00:58:04,615
You can sort your differences later.

1004
00:58:04,672 --> 00:58:05,381
Brother, please don't do it.

1005
00:58:05,422 --> 00:58:07,464
Something worse is about to happen.

1006
00:58:07,464 --> 00:58:10,131
Hey, Aadhi, let go of her.
We'll discuss later.

1007
00:58:10,172 --> 00:58:11,047
Come over here.

1008
00:58:11,795 --> 00:58:13,586
- Shall I tell you or not?
- Tell me.

1009
00:58:25,979 --> 00:58:27,062
In this house...

1010
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:29,672
a fetus has formed.

1011
00:58:31,006 --> 00:58:32,834
And one life is going to be destroyed.

1012
00:58:40,672 --> 00:58:42,177
Before the full moon...

1013
00:58:43,159 --> 00:58:45,534
a life is going to be sacrificed
inside this house.

1014
00:58:45,797 --> 00:58:47,896
A member of the family will be lost.

1015
00:59:01,881 --> 00:59:03,748
That will happen for sure.

1016
00:59:13,756 --> 00:59:17,214
Eeswara, I'm scared that the prediction
of the astrologer might come true.

1017
00:59:17,547 --> 00:59:19,464
Moreover, Rathinasamy is out on bail.

1018
00:59:19,506 --> 00:59:21,506
I'm sure it was him who tried to kill, sir.

1019
00:59:21,797 --> 00:59:24,797
No, Rathinasamy did not do this.

1020
00:59:24,839 --> 00:59:26,131
There's someone else behind it.

1021
00:59:26,131 --> 00:59:27,631
You don't know about Rathinasamy.

1022
00:59:27,672 --> 00:59:29,339
Go and ask around about his traits.

1023
00:59:29,381 --> 00:59:32,131
Hey, he's the reason why I'm here.

1024
00:59:34,422 --> 00:59:35,214
I don't get it.

1025
00:59:35,797 --> 00:59:36,506
Why?

1026
00:59:36,953 --> 00:59:38,662
I am Periyasamy's son.

1027
00:59:40,422 --> 00:59:43,672
Even sir has no idea that I am his son.

1028
00:59:44,297 --> 00:59:47,756
I knew that he was in danger
because of Rathinasamy...

1029
00:59:47,779 --> 00:59:49,232
that's why I arrived at this village.

1030
00:59:49,826 --> 00:59:52,201
Until I'm here whether it's
the astrology...

1031
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:53,256
or it's Rathinasamy,

1032
00:59:53,297 --> 00:59:54,964
or an unidentified enemy.

1033
00:59:55,631 --> 00:59:59,089
No matter what, I will not let
even a single soul die in this family.

1034
01:00:00,339 --> 01:00:01,922
I swear on Lord Murugan!

1035
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,378
Hey!

1036
01:00:25,506 --> 01:00:26,756
Brother-in-law, don't do it.

1037
01:00:26,865 --> 01:00:28,823
Brother, please don't do it.

1038
01:00:28,839 --> 01:00:30,422
Brother, don't do it.

1039
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:31,339
- Brother!
- Oh, no.

1040
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,015
He took advantage of an young girl.

1041
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,672
Sister-in-law, I'm scared that whatever
the astrologer said might come true.

1042
01:00:36,714 --> 01:00:39,498
Please take my advice.
Let's abort the child.

1043
01:00:39,714 --> 01:00:41,797
Please go and talk to
father-in-law about it.

1044
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:44,927
Let's not abort the child.

1045
01:00:46,007 --> 01:00:46,924
It's wrong!

1046
01:00:47,547 --> 01:00:48,672
Brother-in-law, let go of him.

1047
01:00:48,714 --> 01:00:49,464
Why don't we...

1048
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:53,416
...get them married?

1049
01:00:55,297 --> 01:00:56,797
Hey, let go of me!

1050
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,654
Dad, she hasn't even graduated college.

1051
01:01:00,686 --> 01:01:01,811
She's too young for marriage.

1052
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:03,034
What makes you say that?

1053
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:06,896
Your mother was fourteen
when I got married to her.

1054
01:01:07,183 --> 01:01:09,896
I raised a family and children.

1055
01:01:09,948 --> 01:01:11,156
I fathered you, damn it.

1056
01:01:12,225 --> 01:01:14,896
She's bearing our lineage.

1057
01:01:14,951 --> 01:01:16,076
- Dad-
- Hey!

1058
01:01:17,309 --> 01:01:19,857
I've decided to get her married.

1059
01:01:20,225 --> 01:01:21,896
The wedding is tomorrow.

1060
01:01:32,934 --> 01:01:36,809
Rathinasamy, Kali read premonitions
at Periyasamy's house.

1061
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:38,771
It said, one life will be lost for sure.

1062
01:01:39,017 --> 01:01:40,517
Kali was wrong about his predictions.

1063
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,216
Not just one life,
but the entire family will be wiped clean.

1064
01:01:43,434 --> 01:01:47,193
Son, you're enmity is with Periyasamy.
Why do you have to kill the entire family?

1065
01:01:47,344 --> 01:01:48,052
That's not fair.

1066
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,959
Brother, I stand orphaned losing my
wife and daughter.

1067
01:01:51,019 --> 01:01:53,365
Similarly, Periyasamy will stand
orphaned too.

1068
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:57,934
Brother, why does Rathinasamy
hates Periyasamy's family?

1069
01:01:57,975 --> 01:02:01,517
It so happened, Rathinasamy had a daughter
who was supposed to get married.

1070
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:05,709
Three years ago, he was making arrangements
for her daughter's wedding.

1071
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:10,559
During that time, Periyasamy called
and asked me to bring Rathinasamy.

1072
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,725
- Does this look good?
- Ask your dad.

1073
01:02:12,767 --> 01:02:14,100
- Dad!
- Tell me, dear.

1074
01:02:14,517 --> 01:02:16,475
- Does this look good?
- It looks good.

1075
01:02:16,517 --> 01:02:18,892
- Buy whatever you like.
- Thanks, dad.

1076
01:02:20,087 --> 01:02:20,837
Brother-in-law.

1077
01:02:22,702 --> 01:02:24,077
Periyasamy just called me.

1078
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:25,642
He asked me to get you,
because it's very important it seems.

1079
01:02:25,684 --> 01:02:27,517
- What is it?
- I don't know.

1080
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:32,667
Rathinasamy went to his house.

1081
01:02:32,684 --> 01:02:35,059
Only when he reached his house,
he came to know...

1082
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:38,267
Rathinasamy had sexually abused a worker
at his leased land.

1083
01:02:38,309 --> 01:02:41,290
When Periyasamy came to know,
it became a huge issue.

1084
01:02:43,767 --> 01:02:45,392
What the hell have you done?

1085
01:02:45,434 --> 01:02:46,978
I should beat you to death.

1086
01:02:47,005 --> 01:02:49,297
Listen, don't try to threaten me.

1087
01:02:49,514 --> 01:02:50,741
I came here as a courtesy.

1088
01:02:51,431 --> 01:02:54,573
- Don't make me do it.
- Hey, don't you dare point at him.

1089
01:02:55,059 --> 01:02:56,892
Hey, mind your words.

1090
01:02:56,934 --> 01:02:58,309
You'll return a corpse, damn it.

1091
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:00,892
Damn it, you committed a mistake,
and have the audacity threaten him.

1092
01:03:00,934 --> 01:03:06,970
Hey, they come from far off
to make a living.

1093
01:03:07,267 --> 01:03:08,934
Look at that girl.

1094
01:03:08,975 --> 01:03:11,059
There's a huge age difference.

1095
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,656
You should be ashamed to call
yourself human.

1096
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,556
Hey, I was going to compensate.
Why did you come to him?

1097
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,767
Listen, I've leased that land...

1098
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:21,395
the farm is not yours
at the moment.

1099
01:03:21,649 --> 01:03:24,017
They work for me. I'll handle this issue.

1100
01:03:24,048 --> 01:03:26,559
How dare you take the ownership
of that land?

1101
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,475
Taking on lease doesn't mean
you own it.

1102
01:03:29,517 --> 01:03:31,225
This is my land, damn it.

1103
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:35,100
You behaved indecently on my land,
and have the audacity to call it yours.

1104
01:03:35,142 --> 01:03:36,251
Listen, old man...

1105
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:40,809
I don't care if you take me to the
court or a council.

1106
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,475
I will testify against you.

1107
01:03:43,505 --> 01:03:45,589
The entire village will support me on that.

1108
01:03:46,434 --> 01:03:48,228
Hey, walk damn it.

1109
01:03:54,342 --> 01:03:56,551
After the police arrested, Rathinasamy...

1110
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,017
the next day it was a huge news
in the papers.

1111
01:03:59,071 --> 01:04:01,725
And that ended the wedding of
Rathinasamy's daughter.

1112
01:04:01,772 --> 01:04:05,147
Due to the humiliation both
mother and the daughter hanged themselves.

1113
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,684
Since that day,
he hated the entire family of Periyasamy--

1114
01:04:07,725 --> 01:04:09,642
- Hey!
- Get inside the vehicle.

1115
01:04:14,676 --> 01:04:17,235
When we left from home I did say that
we can go to my mother's place...

1116
01:04:17,267 --> 01:04:18,314
but you never listened.

1117
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:20,642
Tomorrow I'm taking the kids with me
to my mother's house.

1118
01:04:20,684 --> 01:04:24,559
Listen, your brother's family is leaving
to his in-laws tomorrow.

1119
01:04:24,613 --> 01:04:26,446
To his in-laws?

1120
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:28,774
He's a scared chicken!

1121
01:04:28,809 --> 01:04:31,267
He would've made that decision
after the astrologer's prediction.

1122
01:04:31,309 --> 01:04:33,350
He has taken the right decision.

1123
01:04:33,392 --> 01:04:35,100
You can stay back and wait
for your death.

1124
01:04:35,131 --> 01:04:37,337
I'm taking the kids along
to my mother's house.

1125
01:04:37,642 --> 01:04:40,225
I don't understand what's there to
think about?

1126
01:04:40,225 --> 01:04:41,725
Are you going to ask your father?

1127
01:04:41,771 --> 01:04:43,730
Or shall we women speak to him about it?

1128
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:48,225
Uncle, why were everyone
fighting out here?

1129
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:51,350
It's just like how you and Diya were
fighting yesterday.

1130
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:52,059
Yes

1131
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,430
Then, later you guys patched up.

1132
01:04:53,684 --> 01:04:55,434
Similarly, everything fall into place.

1133
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:59,142
Uncle, will someone die
like the astrologer mentioned?

1134
01:04:59,184 --> 01:05:02,184
Oh, god, nothing will happen
of that sort, sweetie.

1135
01:05:02,434 --> 01:05:03,184
He said it just like that.

1136
01:05:03,225 --> 01:05:07,142
Uncle, I'm really scared thinking
something bad might happen to grandpa.

1137
01:05:07,434 --> 01:05:11,184
Sweetheart, grandpa is like a god to us.

1138
01:05:11,225 --> 01:05:13,267
- Can anyone harm the god?
- No they can't.

1139
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,684
No, right
So, nothing will happen to grandpa.

1140
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:20,157
If we go to the temple and
pray to the god...

1141
01:05:20,184 --> 01:05:21,934
will he save us from it?

1142
01:05:21,975 --> 01:05:23,517
He'll definitely save us all.

1143
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:26,434
Do you think that astrologer's predictions
might come true?

1144
01:05:26,767 --> 01:05:28,267
Nothing will happen, dear.

1145
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:30,235
Uncle, you're lying to us.

1146
01:05:30,267 --> 01:05:32,434
- Really?
- Yesterday, my father was saying...

1147
01:05:32,475 --> 01:05:34,767
that the astrologer's prediction
will come true.

1148
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,934
Listen, life is uncertain!

1149
01:05:39,356 --> 01:05:41,564
Anything could happen.

1150
01:05:41,934 --> 01:05:44,850
At the end,
what we truly believe will happen.

1151
01:05:45,684 --> 01:05:47,559
If you think positive,
good things will happen to you.

1152
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:50,017
- Do you promise?
- Promise.

1153
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:51,600
"Life as we perceive it."

1154
01:05:51,642 --> 01:05:53,767
Hey, it's late.
Everyone go and sleep.

1155
01:05:53,809 --> 01:05:54,892
- Hey, go!
- Everyone get to bed.

1156
01:05:54,892 --> 01:05:55,642
- Come on, kids, get going.
- Goodnight, uncle.

1157
01:05:55,684 --> 01:05:57,267
- Get to bed.
- Goodnight, uncle.

1158
01:05:57,309 --> 01:05:58,142
What is it?

1159
01:05:59,225 --> 01:06:01,142
We've decided to get back home
in the morning.

1160
01:06:01,184 --> 01:06:03,600
Hey, what went wrong?

1161
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,309
Dad, please listen, nothing has been right
since we got here.

1162
01:06:07,309 --> 01:06:08,684
- Nothing is going right.
- Son, listen to me--

1163
01:06:08,725 --> 01:06:10,975
Dad, please don't stop us.

1164
01:06:11,017 --> 01:06:13,225
- We're leaving tomorrow. Let's go.
- Goodnight, dad.

1165
01:06:23,642 --> 01:06:25,767
I'm getting this project done
during the pandemic.

1166
01:06:25,809 --> 01:06:27,100
So... hey- hey!

1167
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,392
Not you.

1168
01:06:30,267 --> 01:06:32,059
Eeswara, everyone is about to leave.

1169
01:06:32,527 --> 01:06:35,902
Do you have a plan"Or at least
let's remove air from the tires.

1170
01:06:35,934 --> 01:06:36,767
Tender coconut!

1171
01:06:36,809 --> 01:06:38,809
I was just saying, dude.

1172
01:06:39,392 --> 01:06:40,314
Look, they're here.

1173
01:06:43,934 --> 01:06:45,142
They're leaving.

1174
01:06:47,147 --> 01:06:49,439
- Let them leave.
- They're going to leave.

1175
01:06:50,142 --> 01:06:52,267
- You don't care, is it?
- They won't leave.

1176
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:53,684
Why, do you have a plan?

1177
01:06:53,684 --> 01:06:55,184
Planning won't help.

1178
01:06:55,225 --> 01:06:57,975
- That's your plan?
- I'm sad that you people are leaving.

1179
01:06:58,017 --> 01:06:59,517
Who is from Chennai here?

1180
01:06:59,517 --> 01:07:00,434
Hold on for a minute.

1181
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:01,725
- I said, right.
- Speak up, say something.

1182
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:02,392
You never did.

1183
01:07:02,434 --> 01:07:04,559
Sir, all of us are from Chennai.

1184
01:07:04,598 --> 01:07:06,282
- Why do you ask?
- How long has it been?

1185
01:07:06,309 --> 01:07:07,184
It's been four to five days.

1186
01:07:07,184 --> 01:07:10,225
It's been that long.
Damn it, don't come closer.

1187
01:07:10,282 --> 01:07:12,470
Step back you moron.
Where's your mask?

1188
01:07:12,517 --> 01:07:14,100
Wear your mask, damn it.

1189
01:07:14,142 --> 01:07:16,767
Disgusting, put down your dhoti.

1190
01:07:16,809 --> 01:07:18,309
Hey, turn around woman.

1191
01:07:18,309 --> 01:07:19,767
Don't you have any sense?
There are women around here.

1192
01:07:19,809 --> 01:07:21,392
Look at your outfit, so hideous!

1193
01:07:21,434 --> 01:07:23,184
No sense of dressing, damn it.

1194
01:07:23,184 --> 01:07:24,600
You people don't seem right to me.

1195
01:07:24,642 --> 01:07:26,392
Everyone give me your Aadhar cards.

1196
01:07:26,434 --> 01:07:27,767
If I don't get your Aadhar cards...

1197
01:07:27,809 --> 01:07:29,100
I'm going to throw you guys
into Corona camp.

1198
01:07:29,142 --> 01:07:30,939
Hold on, I have your Aadhar card.

1199
01:07:33,602 --> 01:07:34,727
Oh, this was your plan.

1200
01:07:34,767 --> 01:07:35,850
Asking for Aadhar is it?

1201
01:07:37,184 --> 01:07:40,017
- Stop coughing damn it.
- Pardon me, sir.

1202
01:07:40,059 --> 01:07:40,850
Here you go.

1203
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,975
Hey, this is family planning card.

1204
01:07:45,017 --> 01:07:47,225
Damn it, give me the Aadhar card!

1205
01:07:47,267 --> 01:07:49,350
Eeswara, who are these people?

1206
01:07:49,392 --> 01:07:50,993
They're here from health department.

1207
01:07:51,225 --> 01:07:54,225
For next fourteen days,
no one can leave the house.

1208
01:07:54,248 --> 01:07:55,040
How's my plan?

1209
01:07:55,059 --> 01:07:56,517
Be happy with the grand-kids.

1210
01:07:57,532 --> 01:08:01,684
Lovelies, none of you are going back home.

1211
01:08:01,723 --> 01:08:04,139
You guys are going to be with grandpa.

1212
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:07,949
Why is it taking so long to
get the Aadhar card?

1213
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:10,431
- Give that to me.
- Hey, is this your wallet?

1214
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:13,142
- Aadhi, this is uncle speaking.
- Tell me, uncle.

1215
01:08:13,184 --> 01:08:15,309
Mayakannan who was at the function
has tested Covid-positive.

1216
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:17,684
- Are you serious?
- What happened?

1217
01:08:17,684 --> 01:08:18,934
What is this twist?

1218
01:08:18,934 --> 01:08:20,225
I have nothing to do with it.

1219
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:24,809
That's right, Mayakannan and his two
friends are tested positive.

1220
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,017
So, everyone at the function has been
asked to come at 9am tomorrow...

1221
01:08:27,017 --> 01:08:29,309
for a test at the CSI Hospital.

1222
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:31,517
So, everyone be there.

1223
01:08:39,309 --> 01:08:41,392
- Mams, style, is it?
- Yeah!

1224
01:08:41,434 --> 01:08:44,809
Buddy, if we wear this dress
will it prevent from catching the virus?

1225
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:46,059
You can't even pee.

1226
01:08:46,642 --> 01:08:48,934
They why are they imposing lock down.

1227
01:08:48,975 --> 01:08:50,275
They can just give these outfits
to every house.

1228
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:51,892
Everyone can carry on with their work.

1229
01:08:51,923 --> 01:08:53,090
The idea is really good.

1230
01:08:53,123 --> 01:08:54,248
I'll pass it on to the Prime Minister.

1231
01:08:54,302 --> 01:08:55,927
Can you just shut up for now?

1232
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:58,392
That's what I meant!

1233
01:08:58,829 --> 01:09:00,996
- Double meaning, is it?
- On your face!

1234
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:03,863
- Eeswara!
- What is it?

1235
01:09:04,704 --> 01:09:06,287
I hope you won't test positive.

1236
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:08,314
I won't.

1237
01:09:08,981 --> 01:09:11,981
- I won't test positive too, right?
- I'm not sure.

1238
01:09:12,361 --> 01:09:14,684
That means even our children won't
test positive, right?

1239
01:09:14,725 --> 01:09:15,809
Our children?

1240
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:18,791
I mean to say these kids out here.

1241
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:21,329
Can't you speak in straight tongue?

1242
01:09:21,846 --> 01:09:23,142
If you keep at it...

1243
01:09:23,184 --> 01:09:25,225
I'll go beyond and
have children with you.

1244
01:09:25,287 --> 01:09:26,204
I'm ready!

1245
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:27,420
I'm not ready!

1246
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:30,392
I was just kidding,
and she immediately committed to it.

1247
01:09:30,434 --> 01:09:31,434
Eeswara, steady!

1248
01:09:31,434 --> 01:09:33,059
Hey, get back.

1249
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:35,256
Please step aside.
Form a straight line.

1250
01:09:35,934 --> 01:09:40,059
Listen, were you hanging out
with Mayakannan at the function?

1251
01:09:40,103 --> 01:09:42,059
Hey, he's a useless creature.

1252
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:44,350
I hope you remember,
how he was mocking us.

1253
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:46,225
Why would I hang out with him?
Turn around, damn it.

1254
01:09:46,263 --> 01:09:48,096
Yeah, right, all you know is to get angry.

1255
01:09:49,498 --> 01:09:51,207
You're my sweetheart!

1256
01:09:59,142 --> 01:10:04,100
Listen, I heard that you were
hanging out with Mayakannan.

1257
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,434
He was hanging out with me.

1258
01:10:06,475 --> 01:10:08,049
I was not hanging out with him.

1259
01:10:09,017 --> 01:10:10,267
She bought it!

1260
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,080
Damn you, man,
she believes anything you say.

1261
01:10:13,403 --> 01:10:14,236
Vanakkam, doctor.

1262
01:10:15,559 --> 01:10:18,392
Eeswara, were you at the function too?

1263
01:10:18,434 --> 01:10:19,510
Yes, doctor.

1264
01:10:19,934 --> 01:10:21,934
Periyasamy, sir, had gone with his family.

1265
01:10:21,975 --> 01:10:23,809
So, I accompanied them.

1266
01:10:24,184 --> 01:10:25,642
Doctor, when will we get the results?

1267
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:26,934
You'll get it by tomorrow evening.

1268
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:28,271
Tomorrow evening?

1269
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:30,475
Doctor, everyone is shitting their pants...

1270
01:10:30,537 --> 01:10:32,162
they can't bear the suspense that long.

1271
01:10:32,201 --> 01:10:34,576
Is it possible to get the results today?

1272
01:10:35,533 --> 01:10:36,934
Let me do one thing...

1273
01:10:36,957 --> 01:10:39,873
I'll ask Murugan to call you
at 5pm from the lab.

1274
01:10:39,904 --> 01:10:41,738
- Thank you, doctor.
- Sit down.

1275
01:10:44,934 --> 01:10:47,127
I think the astrologer's predictions
might come true.

1276
01:10:47,715 --> 01:10:50,048
Due to corona,
one life is going to be sacrificed.

1277
01:10:50,105 --> 01:10:52,021
Not sure who is going to die.

1278
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,892
- Tell me something.
- What is it?

1279
01:10:54,934 --> 01:10:56,767
What are the symptoms of Corona?

1280
01:10:57,225 --> 01:10:59,725
First you'll lose the sense of smell.

1281
01:11:00,809 --> 01:11:03,434
- Bhavani, get tea for everyone.
- Brother-in-law...

1282
01:11:03,475 --> 01:11:05,725
I couldn't smell the curry you sister made
in the morning.

1283
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:08,434
- Her cooking has never smelled anything.
- You're right!

1284
01:11:08,475 --> 01:11:09,434
That's a fact!

1285
01:11:10,059 --> 01:11:11,600
- Second symptom?
- Here you go.

1286
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,809
Second symptom is that you'll lose
the sense of taste.

1287
01:11:14,856 --> 01:11:15,689
Oh, okay.

1288
01:11:17,767 --> 01:11:20,100
Hey, why didn't you add sugar?

1289
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:22,100
- I added three spoons of sugar.
- Oh, no!

1290
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:24,767
- So, you got Corona?
- No, brother-in-law.

1291
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:26,850
I was just being sarcastic,
'cause it's too sweet.

1292
01:11:26,892 --> 01:11:28,184
- Brother, here you go.
- Don't lie to me.

1293
01:11:28,225 --> 01:11:30,017
Your husband touched it.
I won't touch it anymore.

1294
01:11:30,059 --> 01:11:31,600
Don't try to kill me with a tea.

1295
01:11:32,267 --> 01:11:35,517
I can't trust anyone.
Let me social-distance from them.

1296
01:11:35,555 --> 01:11:37,472
Third symptom?

1297
01:11:37,934 --> 01:11:41,434
You'll catch cold and start coughing.

1298
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:45,103
Then you'll start gasping for breath,
thus you'll end up in the hospital.

1299
01:11:45,149 --> 01:11:46,774
Why the hell is he torturing me?

1300
01:11:47,267 --> 01:11:49,932
Brother-in-law,
why are you gasping like a rabid dog?

1301
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,352
I was just running a test on myself.

1302
01:11:53,524 --> 01:11:54,441
Nothing to worry.

1303
01:11:55,767 --> 01:11:57,283
They've made me blab like a fool

1304
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,184
What if, something happens to me...

1305
01:11:59,225 --> 01:12:00,517
- Come closer!
- Stop it.

1306
01:12:00,559 --> 01:12:01,455
Come on!

1307
01:12:01,475 --> 01:12:03,392
- Are you mad everyone is out here.
- Hey.

1308
01:12:03,434 --> 01:12:05,017
He's been ranting all along.

1309
01:12:05,056 --> 01:12:07,278
- Hey, I'm speaking to you.
- I'm going to whack you.

1310
01:12:07,652 --> 01:12:08,985
What the hell are you guys doing?

1311
01:12:09,017 --> 01:12:11,017
The entire family scared that
they might die.

1312
01:12:11,059 --> 01:12:12,267
And you guys are shamelessly romancing.

1313
01:12:12,309 --> 01:12:14,725
Get up and go inside. I said, go inside.

1314
01:12:14,767 --> 01:12:16,486
- Hey, you too get up.
- Sorry!

1315
01:12:17,169 --> 01:12:19,461
Where are you going?
You too go inside the room.

1316
01:12:19,934 --> 01:12:23,064
- Uncle!
- I'm not your uncle, damn it.

1317
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,267
Lock the door.

1318
01:12:24,314 --> 01:12:26,064
He's going overboard with excitement.

1319
01:12:26,723 --> 01:12:29,348
Don't worry they're just going to talk,
nothing else though.

1320
01:12:29,379 --> 01:12:31,420
Fine, get to the point.
Where were we?

1321
01:12:32,759 --> 01:12:33,759
You died!

1322
01:12:34,704 --> 01:12:36,721
If by chance I die of corona.

1323
01:12:37,271 --> 01:12:40,313
You three brothers without fighting
pay off my debt.

1324
01:12:40,338 --> 01:12:42,934
Hey, why should we pay off your debt?

1325
01:12:42,949 --> 01:12:45,615
Look, now you're disrespectful.
I'll wait for 5pm, damn it.

1326
01:12:45,646 --> 01:12:47,355
Let's see who gets infected.

1327
01:12:47,809 --> 01:12:49,642
I made a huge mistake by signing as a
guarantor for his loan.

1328
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,721
Ill fate!

1329
01:13:03,517 --> 01:13:05,392
Hey, hold on, the basket is full.

1330
01:13:05,433 --> 01:13:06,642
Fine, take it inside.

1331
01:13:08,225 --> 01:13:09,267
Damn, she's here now.

1332
01:13:10,657 --> 01:13:12,865
They never let him work in peace.

1333
01:13:14,433 --> 01:13:16,142
- Mams!
- What is it?

1334
01:13:16,173 --> 01:13:19,006
- I want to speak to you in private.
- It's private enough, speak.

1335
01:13:20,017 --> 01:13:21,611
Not this kind of private.

1336
01:13:22,892 --> 01:13:24,080
Take your hands off!

1337
01:13:24,225 --> 01:13:26,588
Are you disturbing me during the work?

1338
01:13:26,642 --> 01:13:27,517
Tell me.

1339
01:13:27,589 --> 01:13:30,408
I have a friend, who is of my age...

1340
01:13:30,808 --> 01:13:33,183
has been admitted at the hospital,
'cause she tested positive.

1341
01:13:33,264 --> 01:13:35,197
- It's been a week now.
- So, what?

1342
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:38,375
I doesn't matter if you catch corona
after had experienced everything.

1343
01:13:38,642 --> 01:13:41,433
It's not fair to someone like me,
who hasn't experienced anything.

1344
01:13:41,472 --> 01:13:43,056
Many lives might be saved.

1345
01:13:45,068 --> 01:13:46,235
What is your point?

1346
01:13:46,662 --> 01:13:48,287
You've seen it all.

1347
01:13:48,642 --> 01:13:50,100
But I've seen nothing in my life.

1348
01:13:50,142 --> 01:13:53,674
Your sister and I had a perfect
social-distanced love.

1349
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:55,568
Nothing more happened between us.

1350
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:57,701
Everyone is scared they might die.

1351
01:13:57,725 --> 01:13:58,808
And she's interested in romance.

1352
01:13:58,850 --> 01:13:59,642
Hey!

1353
01:14:04,683 --> 01:14:06,058
Muruga!

1354
01:14:15,705 --> 01:14:18,017
- Hello.
- This is Murugan from the lab.

1355
01:14:18,058 --> 01:14:19,433
Oh, god, what happened?

1356
01:14:19,475 --> 01:14:21,510
The tests results of your family has come.

1357
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:41,892
Everyone has tested negative!

1358
01:14:55,477 --> 01:14:56,768
- Hello!
- Eeswara.

1359
01:14:57,057 --> 01:14:59,337
- Tell me, doctor.
- Did you get the test reports?

1360
01:14:59,362 --> 01:15:00,612
Murgan had called.

1361
01:15:01,104 --> 01:15:02,271
Everyone has tested negative.

1362
01:15:02,321 --> 01:15:04,696
Fine, there's a kid named, Diya, right?

1363
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:05,647
What is her age?

1364
01:15:06,865 --> 01:15:08,282
She must be thirteen years old.

1365
01:15:31,412 --> 01:15:34,079
Uncle, why did you bring me
to the hospital?

1366
01:15:34,213 --> 01:15:36,433
- You catch often cold, right?
- Yes.

1367
01:15:36,475 --> 01:15:38,517
When they tested you for corona...

1368
01:15:38,558 --> 01:15:40,642
they found too much phlegm in your chest.

1369
01:15:40,683 --> 01:15:41,975
So, they ran a test.

1370
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:44,058
They'll give you medicines
and you'll be fine.

1371
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:44,900
Okay.

1372
01:15:45,517 --> 01:15:47,808
- You shouldn't mention this to anyone.
- I won't.

1373
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:49,267
Then the other kids will not
play with you.

1374
01:15:49,308 --> 01:15:51,494
Everyone will think you got corona
and run away from you.

1375
01:15:51,558 --> 01:15:53,432
- So, don't tell anyone.
- No, I won't.

1376
01:15:53,475 --> 01:15:55,307
- Fist bump.
- I won't say.

1377
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:57,350
- You too don't say anything.
- I won't.

1378
01:15:57,392 --> 01:16:00,183
We won't tell anyone.
What if this fatso blurts it out?

1379
01:16:01,142 --> 01:16:02,850
If you call me fatso,
I will tell everyone.

1380
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,558
I will puncture your paunch!

1381
01:16:04,596 --> 01:16:06,475
She stole my punchline!

1382
01:16:06,522 --> 01:16:08,491
- Let's go, dear.
- I'll handle you guys later.

1383
01:16:23,268 --> 01:16:28,314
Eeswara, just as I suspected.
Diya has a big hole in her heart.

1384
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:35,683
"Before the full moon...

1385
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:38,392
a life is going to be sacrificed
inside this house."

1386
01:16:40,225 --> 01:16:45,058
I'll consult the senior doctor, Balaji
and update you on the same.

1387
01:16:45,097 --> 01:16:47,431
He's an expert on this matter.

1388
01:16:48,063 --> 01:16:49,979
Please go ahead doctor.

1389
01:16:50,322 --> 01:16:54,017
Eeswaran, I consulted
senior doctor, Balaji.

1390
01:16:54,049 --> 01:16:57,725
He said we'll schedule the surgery
on 27th morning.

1391
01:16:57,767 --> 01:16:58,225
Okay.

1392
01:16:58,225 --> 01:17:01,267
Until then make sure,
you give her the prescribed medicines.

1393
01:17:01,308 --> 01:17:01,975
Okay, doctor.

1394
01:17:02,025 --> 01:17:04,392
- One important thing.
- Tell me, doctor.

1395
01:17:04,433 --> 01:17:06,517
If she happens to get wheezing...

1396
01:17:06,558 --> 01:17:08,350
or if she faints?

1397
01:17:08,392 --> 01:17:09,892
Please bring her to the hospital
right away.

1398
01:17:09,947 --> 01:17:11,736
- Take good care of her.
- Okay, doctor.

1399
01:17:21,017 --> 01:17:22,850
Okay, we are home.

1400
01:17:24,142 --> 01:17:25,705
Watch your step, dear.

1401
01:17:26,558 --> 01:17:28,183
Here you go.

1402
01:17:28,225 --> 01:17:30,808
We can't be buying new toys all the time.
Be careful with it.

1403
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:34,350
Aadhi, I heard that Rathinasamy
is out on bail.

1404
01:17:34,584 --> 01:17:37,251
Yes, dad, I too heard that
he's out of prison.

1405
01:17:37,432 --> 01:17:38,807
I've informed the sub-inspector
about it.

1406
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:41,267
Fine, please everyone be alert.

1407
01:17:41,308 --> 01:17:43,767
Dude, why is the Godzilla staring at us?

1408
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:45,558
Don't look at the Godzilla face to face.

1409
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,683
If you do, then your day will be ruined.

1410
01:17:47,725 --> 01:17:48,975
- Hey!
- We have to change that.

1411
01:17:49,017 --> 01:17:50,850
- Exactly!
- Hey, guys!

1412
01:17:50,892 --> 01:17:52,517
I meant you guys. Come over here.

1413
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,142
- Godzilla is calling us.
- Come on, guys.

1414
01:17:54,183 --> 01:17:56,558
Walk faster, guys.

1415
01:17:58,475 --> 01:18:01,100
- Where are you coming from?
- Where are We coming from?

1416
01:18:01,767 --> 01:18:04,017
We went to buy toys for Diya.

1417
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,392
- Toys!
- Toys.

1418
01:18:05,433 --> 01:18:06,433
Toys, is it?

1419
01:18:06,475 --> 01:18:08,433
When did hospitals start selling toys?

1420
01:18:09,433 --> 01:18:10,767
Come on, tell me.

1421
01:18:10,808 --> 01:18:12,142
- You saw us?
- Yes.

1422
01:18:13,142 --> 01:18:15,350
- You saw us, right?
- Yes, I did.

1423
01:18:15,392 --> 01:18:16,433
You saw us, right?

1424
01:18:16,475 --> 01:18:17,892
I saw you guys with my eyes wide open.

1425
01:18:17,933 --> 01:18:19,017
- You saw us right?
- Yes!

1426
01:18:19,058 --> 01:18:20,642
Tell us now,
what you were doing out there?

1427
01:18:20,683 --> 01:18:24,392
I was buying sweets at the shop
opposite to the hospital.

1428
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:27,183
- What sweets did you buy?
- Mysore Pak, Jalebi...

1429
01:18:27,251 --> 01:18:29,667
- How does it matter to you?
- Who were you buying sweets for?

1430
01:18:29,701 --> 01:18:31,451
- For my wife.
- Your wife?

1431
01:18:32,433 --> 01:18:33,933
He has bought sweets just for his wife.

1432
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:35,808
Then who will buy sweets for
other people wives?

1433
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:36,975
Then who will buy
it for the kids.

1434
01:18:36,975 --> 01:18:38,475
Have you ever bought a
chocolate for Kutty Puli?

1435
01:18:38,517 --> 01:18:40,933
I've never seen a shameful and
selfish person like you.

1436
01:18:40,975 --> 01:18:42,142
You too ask him, damn it.

1437
01:18:42,183 --> 01:18:43,725
- Shameful creature--
- Hey!

1438
01:18:43,767 --> 01:18:45,683
I'm not saying that and I'm preventing him
from saying too.

1439
01:18:45,725 --> 01:18:46,392
That's about it.

1440
01:18:46,433 --> 01:18:47,808
- What did I do wrong?
- Finally, he's confused.

1441
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:49,350
They're chiding as if I bought it
for my mistress.

1442
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:51,100
Hey, stop right there.

1443
01:18:51,725 --> 01:18:54,017
Hereafter, to all the wives and kids...

1444
01:18:54,058 --> 01:18:55,892
even I'll buy for your future wives.

1445
01:18:55,933 --> 01:18:57,103
He understood our point, let's go.

1446
01:18:57,142 --> 01:18:58,808
Hey, I'm not done!

1447
01:18:59,183 --> 01:18:59,850
He still didn't get it.

1448
01:18:59,892 --> 01:19:02,517
Why were you guys at the hospital?

1449
01:19:05,183 --> 01:19:06,642
- Speak up, damn it.
- I was saying...

1450
01:19:06,683 --> 01:19:08,808
- Toys, toys...
- We were buying Toys.

1451
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:10,017
How many times should I repeat myself?

1452
01:19:10,058 --> 01:19:13,308
I can't believe that they sell toys
at the hospital.

1453
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:15,933
You don't even know to write,
but carry three pens...

1454
01:19:15,975 --> 01:19:18,350
but we believe,
when you say that you know to write.

1455
01:19:18,392 --> 01:19:20,850
Then why shouldn't you believe
that they sell toys at the hospital?

1456
01:19:20,892 --> 01:19:22,017
- you should believe.
- This is not fair.

1457
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,433
Obviously, it's not fair.
Now watch me up the game.

1458
01:19:24,475 --> 01:19:27,600
You people believe that jalebi is served
instead of ladoo at Tirupathi.

1459
01:19:27,642 --> 01:19:29,058
Come on, let's go. They're hopeless.

1460
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,407
Hey, in order to cover your tracks...

1461
01:19:32,475 --> 01:19:33,725
don't highlight my mistakes.

1462
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:35,600
I'm very used to these antics.

1463
01:19:36,433 --> 01:19:38,600
Why were you guys at the hospital?

1464
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:40,392
I gotta handle this in a different way.

1465
01:19:40,649 --> 01:19:42,190
Come on, listen closely.

1466
01:19:42,475 --> 01:19:43,808
Look at my hand.

1467
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:45,767
This is Diya.
We took Diya to hospital...

1468
01:19:45,808 --> 01:19:47,600
we went by bike and got her toys.

1469
01:19:47,642 --> 01:19:49,517
Then doctor called me.
Why did the doctor call me?

1470
01:19:49,558 --> 01:19:55,183
He called to get the details of
our family members for the test.

1471
01:19:55,225 --> 01:19:56,915
That's why went over there.

1472
01:19:57,683 --> 01:20:00,933
Hi-five is it? You could've conveyed it
over the phone.

1473
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:02,821
Why did you meet him in person?

1474
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:03,808
Tell me!

1475
01:20:04,392 --> 01:20:05,558
Comedy?

1476
01:20:05,808 --> 01:20:07,142
- I'm serious!
- Oh, serious?

1477
01:20:07,183 --> 01:20:08,683
- Yes.
- Then, let's get serious too.

1478
01:20:08,712 --> 01:20:11,017
I told you right. The reason why we
went to the hospital.

1479
01:20:11,058 --> 01:20:13,183
- When did you tell me?
- I told you, damn it.

1480
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,433
Look, morons like him are questioning us.

1481
01:20:15,475 --> 01:20:17,017
Why don't you listen to me, damn it?

1482
01:20:17,058 --> 01:20:19,350
You moron!
I was not calling you a moron.

1483
01:20:19,392 --> 01:20:20,079
What is it?

1484
01:20:20,308 --> 01:20:22,225
Brother-in-law, I have to go.
You please talk to him.

1485
01:20:22,267 --> 01:20:23,392
- I'll be back.
- Hey!

1486
01:20:23,433 --> 01:20:24,558
Kutty Puli, you're done!

1487
01:20:24,767 --> 01:20:26,642
Did, sir call him?
I didn't hear him though.

1488
01:20:26,683 --> 01:20:28,517
You didn't? Only the educated can hear it.

1489
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,100
- Sir!
- Did he call you too?

1490
01:20:31,142 --> 01:20:33,433
I said right, that only the educated
can hear him.

1491
01:20:35,725 --> 01:20:37,183
They're insulting me.

1492
01:20:57,225 --> 01:20:59,433
Eeswara, let's not do it.

1493
01:20:59,517 --> 01:21:01,100
Let us tell everyone the truth.

1494
01:21:01,142 --> 01:21:03,392
If something goes wrong,
it'll become an issue.

1495
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:07,392
Look at him, he is so happy
with them around.

1496
01:21:07,975 --> 01:21:10,308
My only wish is to see him happy
all the time.

1497
01:21:10,558 --> 01:21:12,017
How can I spoil that?

1498
01:21:12,475 --> 01:21:14,767
No mater what,
they'll consider you only as a servant.

1499
01:21:14,808 --> 01:21:17,350
If there's a problem,
they'll discard you in no time.

1500
01:21:17,392 --> 01:21:19,642
Hey, they might think of me like that.

1501
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:21,517
But that's not me.

1502
01:21:26,017 --> 01:21:28,683
Sir is my father and his family is
mine too.

1503
01:21:28,892 --> 01:21:31,017
Listen, what if the predictions come true
in Diya's case...

1504
01:21:31,058 --> 01:21:33,975
Hey, don't look up to seers as god!

1505
01:21:34,017 --> 01:21:34,975
Muruga!

1506
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:37,392
I have faith in you.

1507
01:21:39,475 --> 01:21:41,225
I'll let nothing bad happen to them.

1508
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:55,433
The boys are from Tutucorin.

1509
01:21:55,517 --> 01:21:57,058
Moses sent them.

1510
01:21:57,433 --> 01:22:00,058
They're very sharp.
And have executed many kills.

1511
01:22:07,142 --> 01:22:08,017
Dear!

1512
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,350
I want you for lifelong.

1513
01:22:11,558 --> 01:22:12,933
Please don't say no.

1514
01:22:13,225 --> 01:22:14,475
I'm not going to say no.

1515
01:22:14,517 --> 01:22:16,808
It's impossible,
there's no chance it could happen.

1516
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:17,975
Not at all possible.

1517
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:19,475
It's better you stop weaving dreams
about me.

1518
01:22:19,517 --> 01:22:21,142
And carry on with your life.

1519
01:22:21,183 --> 01:22:22,517
Why are you rejecting me?

1520
01:22:22,808 --> 01:22:24,142
You're single right?

1521
01:22:24,225 --> 01:22:25,433
Listen, Poongudi...

1522
01:22:26,433 --> 01:22:29,517
I felt guilty,
when I fell in love with your sister.

1523
01:22:29,558 --> 01:22:33,933
I was scared thinking,
what would your family think of me.

1524
01:22:34,142 --> 01:22:36,392
But I was truly in love with your sister.

1525
01:22:37,683 --> 01:22:39,267
When she broke-up with me...

1526
01:22:39,558 --> 01:22:42,308
I felt it all happened for a good reason.

1527
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:46,142
Now, the family has come together.

1528
01:22:46,183 --> 01:22:47,725
Sir, is extremely happy about it.

1529
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:49,683
I don't want to spoil his happiness.

1530
01:22:50,642 --> 01:22:51,975
I don't want to cause any trouble.

1531
01:22:52,017 --> 01:22:53,642
I'll convince my family, Eeswara.

1532
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:55,058
I want you.

1533
01:22:55,454 --> 01:22:56,829
I want to be with you.

1534
01:22:57,284 --> 01:22:58,447
Have you gone mad?

1535
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,267
I've been trying put some sense
into your head.

1536
01:23:01,975 --> 01:23:05,558
Doesn't matter if it's you or me
wish to marry, it's all the same.

1537
01:23:06,142 --> 01:23:07,642
Everyone will think ill of me.

1538
01:23:08,033 --> 01:23:09,116
You don't understand.

1539
01:23:09,183 --> 01:23:10,433
Eeswar, I too--

1540
01:23:10,475 --> 01:23:11,933
I'm going to slap you hard!

1541
01:23:13,892 --> 01:23:16,392
You don't seem to understand the problem.

1542
01:23:28,576 --> 01:23:29,993
Dear, Poongudi!

1543
01:23:30,558 --> 01:23:31,517
Hold on.

1544
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:40,308
Only now I got to know about everything.

1545
01:23:40,517 --> 01:23:43,100
About your love story with her sister.

1546
01:23:43,392 --> 01:23:46,058
And for my sake, you rejected her.

1547
01:23:47,058 --> 01:23:50,850
Now, you have rejected her too.

1548
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:59,308
Eewara, don't make the same mistake
in life, like I did.

1549
01:24:02,392 --> 01:24:03,725
Parvathy!

1550
01:24:06,665 --> 01:24:10,915
We both were deeply in love
with each other.

1551
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,284
We were from different caste.

1552
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:17,642
When her father came to know...

1553
01:24:17,683 --> 01:24:20,308
he took her away from the village.

1554
01:24:20,667 --> 01:24:22,876
Because my mother forced me...

1555
01:24:22,954 --> 01:24:25,329
I got married to Papathi.

1556
01:24:26,475 --> 01:24:31,100
I never expected Parvathy to return.

1557
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,225
- Get married to me.
- have you gone mad?

1558
01:24:35,767 --> 01:24:39,558
Hey, there's a woman in my life,
who trusts me.

1559
01:24:39,975 --> 01:24:41,975
How can I betray her?

1560
01:24:42,225 --> 01:24:43,267
Fine, you can leave.

1561
01:24:43,308 --> 01:24:45,725
- Parvathy, hear me out.
- For god sake, leave!

1562
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,933
She doesn't seem to understand.

1563
01:24:55,767 --> 01:24:56,517
Hey!

1564
01:24:57,308 --> 01:24:58,558
Parvathy!

1565
01:25:11,433 --> 01:25:15,017
To save her life,
I was left with no other choice.

1566
01:25:15,058 --> 01:25:16,850
With Karuppan as my witness...

1567
01:25:16,892 --> 01:25:19,100
I got married to Parvathy.

1568
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:24,600
Aadhi Sivan was born to us.

1569
01:25:26,392 --> 01:25:29,517
I had this family hidden from Papathi.

1570
01:25:33,267 --> 01:25:37,017
But one day, Papathi came to know about it.

1571
01:25:37,756 --> 01:25:42,964
I thought, I'll suck up my pride
and live through it.

1572
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:46,071
But I couldn't do it.

1573
01:25:46,696 --> 01:25:48,612
I just came down to see you.

1574
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:54,604
But, after looking at you...

1575
01:26:03,225 --> 01:26:05,517
Fine, I'll leave.

1576
01:26:11,058 --> 01:26:14,642
He shouldn't know that
I came and met you.

1577
01:26:15,725 --> 01:26:18,225
He thinks, I'll be shattered
if I come to know about it.

1578
01:26:18,689 --> 01:26:19,897
So be it.

1579
01:26:25,743 --> 01:26:26,659
Parvathy...

1580
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,517
After Papathi's visit...

1581
01:26:31,016 --> 01:26:34,016
Parvathy left me with a letter,

1582
01:26:34,157 --> 01:26:35,948
and went away with my son.

1583
01:26:37,892 --> 01:26:43,017
I have no idea where she is
and how is she doing.

1584
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,600
Eeswara, before I die..

1585
01:26:47,475 --> 01:26:52,683
I live with the hope that
she'll come and meet me.

1586
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:55,267
Please get married to her.

1587
01:26:56,142 --> 01:27:00,183
I wish to make you one of my sons.

1588
01:27:14,725 --> 01:27:16,183
Is that all you want?

1589
01:27:20,222 --> 01:27:21,222
Are you happy?

1590
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:24,478
Okay, are you happy now?

1591
01:27:50,475 --> 01:27:54,725
"My dearest princess,
don't leave me high and dry"

1592
01:27:54,808 --> 01:27:58,683
"Darling, don't stop me from loving you"

1593
01:27:58,933 --> 01:28:03,308
"Oh, my sweet candy.
Don't pretend that you're shy..."

1594
01:28:03,392 --> 01:28:06,683
"and move away pushing me down"

1595
01:28:06,767 --> 01:28:11,100
"I've safeguarded you
in the cradle of my heart"

1596
01:28:11,558 --> 01:28:13,808
"Beauty is strewn around"

1597
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:15,808
"Come and have a chat with me"

1598
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:19,767
"Your eyes are a boat that
can take me to the shore"

1599
01:28:20,183 --> 01:28:22,308
"Eagle wants to hook you"

1600
01:28:22,392 --> 01:28:24,308
"Smear me all through your body"

1601
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:28,058
"I am a sluice that can control
the forceful river"

1602
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:29,975
"I am a sluice!"

1603
01:28:30,548 --> 01:28:35,006
"I am the only knight suitable for you"

1604
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:38,975
"I will touch and kiss your silky cheek.
Just wait and see"

1605
01:28:39,058 --> 01:28:41,225
"I am the Armour of success"

1606
01:28:41,267 --> 01:28:43,600
"I do not put on a mask"

1607
01:28:43,642 --> 01:28:48,433
"Who can be better than the the
gem of a son of your mom-in-law"

1608
01:28:50,029 --> 01:28:51,321
"Drop the beat!"

1609
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:08,808
"Drop the beat!"

1610
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:21,058
"Sing for the nuptials
Pray for a long life"

1611
01:29:21,142 --> 01:29:26,017
"Dance for the nuptials
Pray for a long life"

1612
01:30:08,642 --> 01:30:13,017
"My dearest princess,
don't leave me high and dry"

1613
01:30:13,058 --> 01:30:17,308
"I changed my path just for you"

1614
01:30:17,392 --> 01:30:21,725
"Hey, you, sweet candy,
don't fool this innocent girl"

1615
01:30:21,767 --> 01:30:24,975
"and leave to safeguard your love."

1616
01:30:25,017 --> 01:30:29,475
"I tied you to my soul,
without fussing, my dear"

1617
01:30:29,767 --> 01:30:31,767
"My fingers are embracing you"

1618
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:34,183
"My voice is only to call your name"

1619
01:30:34,225 --> 01:30:38,142
"You are a blessing of the god of love"

1620
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:40,600
"My days start with you"

1621
01:30:40,642 --> 01:30:42,642
"The hot sun drizzles in the heart"

1622
01:30:42,683 --> 01:30:46,350
"In your gaze, the storm would vanish"

1623
01:30:46,683 --> 01:30:51,183
"I am the only knight suitable for you"

1624
01:30:51,225 --> 01:30:55,142
"I will touch and kiss your silky cheek.
Just wait and see"

1625
01:30:55,225 --> 01:30:57,225
"I am the Armour of success"

1626
01:30:57,267 --> 01:30:59,767
"I do not put on a mask"

1627
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:04,600
"Who can be better than the the
gem of a son of your mom-in-law"

1628
01:31:06,183 --> 01:31:07,433
"Drop the beat!"

1629
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:16,142
"Drop the beat!"

1630
01:31:23,808 --> 01:31:28,392
"Sing for the nuptials
Pray for a long life"

1631
01:31:28,433 --> 01:31:32,808
"Dance for the nuptials
Pray for a long life"

1632
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:34,767
"Sing for the nuptials.."

1633
01:31:34,892 --> 01:31:36,767
"Pray for a long life"

1634
01:31:36,808 --> 01:31:41,808
"Dance for the nuptials
Pray for a long life"

1635
01:31:45,339 --> 01:31:48,464
Aathira, did you inform everyone
about the picnic at the dam?

1636
01:31:48,506 --> 01:31:50,006
Yeah, I've informed them.

1637
01:31:50,256 --> 01:31:52,506
Tomorrow is full moon,
so father won't join us.

1638
01:31:52,547 --> 01:31:53,756
But others will come.

1639
01:31:53,797 --> 01:31:55,297
The others are coming right?

1640
01:31:55,422 --> 01:31:57,089
First thing in the morning,
we're heading to the dam.

1641
01:31:57,131 --> 01:31:59,297
Later the sun will get too hot
for the kids.

1642
01:32:22,297 --> 01:32:23,672
Stay quiet.

1643
01:32:29,506 --> 01:32:31,547
- Where are you now?
- We're leaving.

1644
01:32:32,214 --> 01:32:34,797
I asked you to leave by 7am,
why are you guys running late?

1645
01:32:34,839 --> 01:32:36,547
Listen, it is not just the adults...

1646
01:32:36,589 --> 01:32:38,422
we have to get the kids ready too.

1647
01:32:38,464 --> 01:32:40,297
I wonder why you left ahead of us.

1648
01:32:40,422 --> 01:32:42,047
Fine, did you guys get inside the vehicle?

1649
01:32:42,089 --> 01:32:43,839
We're on our way.
We'll be there in half an hour.

1650
01:32:43,881 --> 01:32:46,006
- Come sooner.
- Fine, hang up.

1651
01:32:46,714 --> 01:32:48,172
Watch you step, kids.

1652
01:32:48,214 --> 01:32:50,131
Hey, I want the window seat.

1653
01:33:00,964 --> 01:33:02,214
Why did you stop the vehicle?

1654
01:33:02,256 --> 01:33:04,422
Check if the tire is flat?

1655
01:33:04,464 --> 01:33:06,464
The vehicle is pulling towards one side.

1656
01:33:07,422 --> 01:33:09,714
Brother, it's a flat tire.

1657
01:33:09,756 --> 01:33:11,631
- Everyone get down.
- I know this would happen.

1658
01:33:11,672 --> 01:33:14,047
- is there no stepney?
- I think we weren't meant to go.

1659
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,422
Why are you so decked up
to go to the dam?

1660
01:33:15,464 --> 01:33:17,172
Why did you come back so soon?

1661
01:33:17,214 --> 01:33:19,006
Uncle, car is punctured

1662
01:33:19,047 --> 01:33:21,964
- Come on, let's go and play at the farm.
- Okay, careful

1663
01:33:22,006 --> 01:33:24,547
Come on, let's play hide and seek.

1664
01:33:37,839 --> 01:33:39,381
Rock, paper, scissors.

1665
01:33:39,422 --> 01:33:41,422
Rock, paper, scissors!

1666
01:33:41,464 --> 01:33:43,006
Madhu, you're out!

1667
01:34:18,214 --> 01:34:20,339
(Mobile ringtone)

1668
01:34:24,214 --> 01:34:27,464
- Where have you reached?
- Listen, We had a flat tire.

1669
01:34:27,547 --> 01:34:30,672
- So?
- We're heading back home.

1670
01:34:30,964 --> 01:34:32,381
- You went back home?
- Yes.

1671
01:34:32,422 --> 01:34:34,917
- Where are the kids?
- They're playing at the farm.

1672
01:35:04,256 --> 01:35:06,839
- Why is there a bike parked?
- They might've stopped to pee.

1673
01:35:06,881 --> 01:35:08,172
There's no number plate on the bike.

1674
01:35:08,256 --> 01:35:10,381
Why do they need a number plate
to pee?

1675
01:35:11,964 --> 01:35:13,464
Hey, who is that?

1676
01:35:48,797 --> 01:35:50,256
It was you driving that truck, right?

1677
01:35:50,339 --> 01:35:51,756
Brother, please spare me.

1678
01:35:51,839 --> 01:35:53,631
Hey, who are you?

1679
01:35:53,797 --> 01:35:55,589
Hey, tell me, damn it. Who are you?

1680
01:35:55,631 --> 01:35:57,672
- What are you doing over here?
- I'll tell you the truth.

1681
01:35:57,714 --> 01:35:59,172
- Tell me.
- I'll confess.

1682
01:35:59,214 --> 01:36:00,922
You've been dragging out this deal

1683
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:02,172
The client has asked to find someone else.

1684
01:36:02,214 --> 01:36:05,589
Please, sir, we'll sign the agreement
in fifteen days.

1685
01:36:05,631 --> 01:36:07,839
- I won't fail you this time.
- Fine, get it sorted soon.

1686
01:36:07,881 --> 01:36:08,381
Okay, sir.

1687
01:36:08,422 --> 01:36:12,047
Sir, your father-in-law's will states that
you can't buy or sell that land.

1688
01:36:12,089 --> 01:36:13,839
How will you sign the agreement?

1689
01:36:14,131 --> 01:36:15,256
I can't sell.

1690
01:36:15,297 --> 01:36:18,172
So, I have leased the land
for 99 years to build a college.

1691
01:36:18,214 --> 01:36:19,422
The deal is for fifteen crores.

1692
01:36:19,464 --> 01:36:20,256
Awesome, sir.

1693
01:36:20,256 --> 01:36:22,006
I've signed an agreement for five crores.

1694
01:36:22,047 --> 01:36:24,756
If I give my brother-in-laws' each one crore,
they'll be happy.

1695
01:36:24,797 --> 01:36:25,422
That's great, sir.

1696
01:36:25,464 --> 01:36:27,089
The balance amount will be mine.

1697
01:36:27,263 --> 01:36:29,846
But it won't be possible
if my father-in-law is alive.

1698
01:36:30,006 --> 01:36:31,797
So, I have an idea.

1699
01:36:32,006 --> 01:36:33,881
Run him over with a truck and kill him.

1700
01:36:34,506 --> 01:36:35,756
Here you go, five lacs.

1701
01:36:36,222 --> 01:36:37,722
He shouldn't be alive.

1702
01:36:39,464 --> 01:36:40,631
Did you finish the job?

1703
01:36:41,089 --> 01:36:42,922
Hey, you guys leave right away.

1704
01:36:43,422 --> 01:36:45,006
You guys shouldn't call me anymore.

1705
01:36:45,047 --> 01:36:46,214
Destroy the sim-card.

1706
01:36:46,256 --> 01:36:48,506
Hereafter, I have nothing to do
with you guys.

1707
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:49,788
Leave, right away.

1708
01:36:52,964 --> 01:36:54,922
- How many snakes?
- Four snakes.

1709
01:37:48,589 --> 01:37:50,881
Hey, Diya come and catch me.

1710
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:52,190
Catch me.

1711
01:37:52,631 --> 01:37:55,339
Go and catch, Diya, sister.

1712
01:37:57,401 --> 01:38:00,359
Diya, sister, come on, run.

1713
01:38:01,214 --> 01:38:03,881
Ram, run and catch her.

1714
01:38:26,464 --> 01:38:28,006
Statue!

1715
01:38:47,256 --> 01:38:49,589
Eeswara! Sir, is out there.

1716
01:38:58,464 --> 01:39:00,422
Buddy, rub these leaves on your skin.

1717
01:39:00,464 --> 01:39:01,839
To prevent from snake bites.

1718
01:39:01,881 --> 01:39:03,339
Oh, you already have done it.

1719
01:40:34,047 --> 01:40:34,922
Relax!

1720
01:40:37,047 --> 01:40:38,756
Come on, kids, let's form a train.

1721
01:40:38,839 --> 01:40:40,714
Come on, everyone fall in line.

1722
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,881
Come on!

1723
01:41:22,881 --> 01:41:25,700
Dude, it won't get out of the sack, right?

1724
01:42:56,714 --> 01:43:00,339
Aathira, why did you leave the kids alone
in the farm?

1725
01:43:00,381 --> 01:43:02,256
- Come on, brother-in-law.
- What happened?

1726
01:43:02,297 --> 01:43:04,589
- Hey, brother-in-law.
- Not sure what happened.

1727
01:43:04,631 --> 01:43:06,006
Where the hell are you going?

1728
01:43:06,256 --> 01:43:08,256
Hey!

1729
01:43:08,631 --> 01:43:10,214
Hey!

1730
01:43:10,288 --> 01:43:12,872
Hey, Eeswara, what are you doing to him?

1731
01:43:12,964 --> 01:43:14,756
- Stop it.
- Eeswara, What are you doing?

1732
01:43:14,849 --> 01:43:16,349
What happened, Eeswara?

1733
01:43:17,631 --> 01:43:19,964
- Sister-in-law!
- Hey, Eeswara.

1734
01:43:20,547 --> 01:43:22,506
Hey, stop, damn it.

1735
01:43:23,881 --> 01:43:25,797
Brother!

1736
01:43:25,852 --> 01:43:27,727
- Let go of me.
- Brother-in-law!

1737
01:43:27,964 --> 01:43:29,547
Hey, hold him down.

1738
01:43:32,464 --> 01:43:34,464
Hey, stop it.

1739
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:37,758
I said stop it. Why did you beat up
my brother-in-law?

1740
01:43:37,839 --> 01:43:39,256
Tell me, why did you beat up him?

1741
01:43:39,297 --> 01:43:40,339
Do you know what he has done?

1742
01:43:40,422 --> 01:43:41,756
Doesn't matter what he has done.

1743
01:43:41,797 --> 01:43:43,047
That doesn't give you the right
to beat him.

1744
01:43:43,047 --> 01:43:45,006
You know what he did to your father?

1745
01:43:45,047 --> 01:43:47,089
Hey, I may have issues with
my father-in-law.

1746
01:43:47,131 --> 01:43:48,131
You don't have the right
to question me.

1747
01:43:48,214 --> 01:43:50,381
Damn servant, get out of the house.

1748
01:43:52,214 --> 01:43:53,256
Eeswara!

1749
01:43:54,547 --> 01:43:55,797
Eeswaran uncle!

1750
01:43:56,797 --> 01:43:58,672
Eeswaran uncle!

1751
01:43:58,922 --> 01:44:00,589
What the hell are you looking at?

1752
01:44:01,131 --> 01:44:03,381
Brother, please don't hit him.

1753
01:44:03,422 --> 01:44:05,547
Brother, hold it. Please don't him him.

1754
01:44:05,589 --> 01:44:06,714
Lift him up.

1755
01:44:07,339 --> 01:44:08,714
Why are you beating him?

1756
01:44:08,756 --> 01:44:10,881
Brother, don't hit him.

1757
01:44:10,964 --> 01:44:13,047
Eeswaran uncle!

1758
01:44:13,381 --> 01:44:15,297
- Get out.
- Let go of him.

1759
01:44:15,422 --> 01:44:17,672
- Please listen to me.
- Get out damn it.

1760
01:44:19,631 --> 01:44:22,381
Get out. Get out, damn it.

1761
01:44:22,631 --> 01:44:24,297
Periyasamy!

1762
01:44:24,383 --> 01:44:25,800
- Get out of the house.
- Please hear me out.

1763
01:44:25,875 --> 01:44:27,667
- Get out.
- Push him out.

1764
01:44:44,205 --> 01:44:46,705
Sister, something is wrong with Diya.

1765
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:49,312
Diya, what happened to you?

1766
01:44:49,929 --> 01:44:51,763
Diya!

1767
01:44:57,917 --> 01:45:00,209
Where the hell are you going?
Stop, damn it.

1768
01:45:22,214 --> 01:45:23,881
Hey, let go of her.

1769
01:45:23,948 --> 01:45:26,652
Hey, we have to take her
to the hospital.

1770
01:45:26,756 --> 01:45:29,506
Let me go.
We have to go right away.

1771
01:45:29,547 --> 01:45:31,059
I have to take her to the hospital.

1772
01:45:31,121 --> 01:45:33,863
Listen to me, we have to take her
to the hospital.

1773
01:45:33,921 --> 01:45:35,262
We know to take care of our child.

1774
01:45:35,297 --> 01:45:36,547
Why did you beat up my brother-in-law?

1775
01:45:36,605 --> 01:45:38,547
First you beat him up
and now taking away our child.

1776
01:45:38,589 --> 01:45:41,131
Brother, please hear me out.

1777
01:45:48,589 --> 01:45:51,797
Brother, you're beating up
the wrong person.

1778
01:46:26,709 --> 01:46:29,355
No one should remain alive
in this family.

1779
01:46:30,631 --> 01:46:32,506
Kill them all.

1780
01:46:34,172 --> 01:46:35,381
Don't do it.

1781
01:46:35,464 --> 01:46:37,547
Hey, run!

1782
01:46:49,922 --> 01:46:52,006
Kutty Puli!

1783
01:46:53,435 --> 01:46:55,893
Take Diya to the hospital.

1784
01:46:55,974 --> 01:46:58,182
Come on, everyone come with me.

1785
01:46:58,367 --> 01:46:59,826
Come on, let's go.

1786
01:47:36,589 --> 01:47:37,714
Come on!

1787
01:47:51,506 --> 01:47:52,672
Kill him!

1788
01:48:25,023 --> 01:48:26,023
Come on!

1789
01:48:27,919 --> 01:48:29,085
Come on!

1790
01:48:29,811 --> 01:48:30,894
Come!

1791
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:15,422
Get up!

1792
01:49:22,631 --> 01:49:23,797
Let's go.

1793
01:49:28,662 --> 01:49:34,745
Eswaran is no one but Parvathys' son.

1794
01:49:35,391 --> 01:49:38,475
He is your son, Aadhi Sivan!

1795
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:41,753
What are you saying?

1796
01:49:41,795 --> 01:49:44,670
Sonai, is that my son, Aadhi Sivan?

1797
01:49:45,128 --> 01:49:46,753
Are you serious?

1798
01:49:47,134 --> 01:49:49,009
Is that's my son, Aadhi Sivan?

1799
01:49:49,337 --> 01:49:50,295
Yes.

1800
01:49:50,337 --> 01:49:52,295
Eeswaran is my son, Aadhi Sivan?

1801
01:49:52,346 --> 01:49:54,680
Why didn't you tell me this before?

1802
01:49:55,010 --> 01:49:57,010
When Parvathy was on her death bed...

1803
01:49:57,431 --> 01:50:02,381
she took a promise not to tell you
and later died.

1804
01:50:34,658 --> 01:50:36,033
Come on, run faster.

1805
01:50:48,802 --> 01:50:50,510
Come on, keep running.

1806
01:50:56,045 --> 01:50:58,420
Let's go.

1807
01:51:50,354 --> 01:51:53,896
Eeswara, I'm here to Kill
Periyasamy's family.

1808
01:51:53,938 --> 01:51:54,896
You're an outsider.

1809
01:51:54,931 --> 01:51:56,722
Don't die in vain for this family.

1810
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:57,837
Run away!

1811
01:51:58,128 --> 01:51:59,795
I'm not an outsider.

1812
01:52:00,914 --> 01:52:02,622
I am part of this family.

1813
01:52:03,695 --> 01:52:05,778
I am Periyasamy's son!

1814
01:52:12,212 --> 01:52:13,545
This is my family.

1815
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:15,795
They're my blood.

1816
01:52:15,862 --> 01:52:17,821
Then you deserve to die as well.

1817
01:52:18,045 --> 01:52:19,670
Kill him first!

1818
01:52:26,087 --> 01:52:28,670
Put down your weapon,
and think as human for a moment.

1819
01:52:28,878 --> 01:52:30,920
Then you'll realize what is
right and wrong.

1820
01:52:31,212 --> 01:52:32,253
If you're wrong, then apologize.

1821
01:52:32,295 --> 01:52:34,295
If we're at mistake, we'll apologize.

1822
01:52:34,587 --> 01:52:36,378
I'm not human to forgive.

1823
01:52:36,962 --> 01:52:40,420
I'm the "behemoth" that have
come to destroy.

1824
01:52:40,807 --> 01:52:43,391
If you're a behemoth who has
come to destroy!

1825
01:52:43,712 --> 01:52:46,212
I'm the one who protects,
what they call...

1826
01:52:46,712 --> 01:52:48,087
Eeswaran!

1827
01:52:58,587 --> 01:53:00,378
Come on, let's run.

1828
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:01,878
Everyone, run!

1829
01:53:39,712 --> 01:53:40,878
Come on!

1830
01:53:50,232 --> 01:53:51,274
Hey!

1831
01:54:59,462 --> 01:55:00,878
If you're behemoth...

1832
01:55:01,628 --> 01:55:03,253
rightfully I should kill you.

1833
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:06,962
Even now I see you as human,
that's why I forgive you.

1834
01:55:09,763 --> 01:55:12,971
But if you insist on being the monster...

1835
01:55:13,212 --> 01:55:14,837
I'll keep fighting you.

1836
01:55:15,295 --> 01:55:17,295
I'll fight you until you reform.

1837
01:55:18,837 --> 01:55:20,462
I'm sparing your life.

1838
01:55:29,253 --> 01:55:30,253
Diya.

1839
01:55:31,128 --> 01:55:32,420
Diya!

1840
01:55:34,295 --> 01:55:35,837
Everyone please stay back.

1841
01:55:39,779 --> 01:55:42,487
Hey, what happened to Diya?

1842
01:55:43,253 --> 01:55:45,462
Tell me the truth.
What happened to her?

1843
01:55:45,503 --> 01:55:46,378
Tell me.

1844
01:55:46,712 --> 01:55:47,920
Diya has...

1845
01:55:48,795 --> 01:55:51,628
Eeswara, what happened, buddy?

1846
01:55:51,712 --> 01:55:52,712
Hey, buddy!

1847
01:55:52,753 --> 01:55:54,170
Doctor!

1848
01:56:27,485 --> 01:56:29,651
'Before the full moon...

1849
01:56:29,802 --> 01:56:32,552
a life is going to be sacrificed
inside this house.'

1850
01:56:32,615 --> 01:56:34,657
'That will happen for sure.'

1851
01:56:54,443 --> 01:56:55,128
Doctor.

1852
01:56:55,170 --> 01:56:56,420
The surgery went well.

1853
01:56:56,462 --> 01:56:57,920
The child is out of danger.

1854
01:56:57,962 --> 01:57:00,128
You can meet her once she's in
the general ward.

1855
01:57:05,628 --> 01:57:07,170
What happened to Diya?

1856
01:57:07,212 --> 01:57:10,045
- Dad...
- Sir, Diya...

1857
01:57:15,784 --> 01:57:18,409
He didn't want any one to know
about this.

1858
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:21,795
The entire family has gathered
after a long time.

1859
01:57:21,837 --> 01:57:23,337
He didn't want to spoil the happiness...

1860
01:57:23,378 --> 01:57:26,337
and decided to tell everyone
after the surgery.

1861
01:57:28,695 --> 01:57:30,353
Where is Eeswaran?

1862
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:31,587
Where is Eeswaran?

1863
01:57:31,628 --> 01:57:33,753
Sir, Eeswaran...

1864
01:57:33,795 --> 01:57:34,697
Tell me!

1865
01:57:34,753 --> 01:57:36,003
What happened to Eeswaran?

1866
01:57:36,045 --> 01:57:37,337
What happened to my son?

1867
01:57:37,378 --> 01:57:39,753
Dad, is Eeswaran your son?

1868
01:57:40,253 --> 01:57:42,628
Tell me, is Eeswaran your son?

1869
01:57:43,185 --> 01:57:45,893
Mom did mention that you had
another family.

1870
01:57:46,003 --> 01:57:48,304
That means, is he her son?

1871
01:57:49,545 --> 01:57:53,087
Dad, all this while you and Eeswaran
have been fooling us.

1872
01:57:53,128 --> 01:57:53,962
Am I right?

1873
01:57:54,003 --> 01:57:55,087
Now I understood.

1874
01:57:55,128 --> 01:57:57,628
When brother-in-law spoke about the will,
you refused to change it.

1875
01:57:57,670 --> 01:57:59,045
So, that he can inherit it.

1876
01:57:59,337 --> 01:58:00,378
Say something, dad.

1877
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:02,670
Brother, have you gone mad?

1878
01:58:03,378 --> 01:58:05,003
Don't keep ranting nonsense.

1879
01:58:05,503 --> 01:58:08,853
Sir, came to know only today
that Eeswaran is his son.

1880
01:58:09,170 --> 01:58:12,181
He hid the truth to keep up the promise
he made to his mother.

1881
01:58:12,253 --> 01:58:14,295
Brother, he's unlike you people.

1882
01:58:14,337 --> 01:58:15,670
He is a honest son.

1883
01:58:15,712 --> 01:58:17,753
You're just posing as his children.

1884
01:58:18,378 --> 01:58:21,253
In these past three years,
sir has been sick most of the time.

1885
01:58:21,479 --> 01:58:23,521
None of you bothered to come
and see him.

1886
01:58:24,003 --> 01:58:26,795
He has even cleaned his stools and urine.

1887
01:58:26,837 --> 01:58:29,420
I doubt even your mother
would've done it.

1888
01:58:29,795 --> 01:58:31,837
Do you think he cares for his
inheritance?

1889
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:33,547
Do you know who was behind
his inheritance?

1890
01:58:33,596 --> 01:58:35,346
Here, your brother-in-law...

1891
01:58:35,404 --> 01:58:38,487
it was him who hired men to
leave snakes to kill your father.

1892
01:58:38,753 --> 01:58:41,378
He saved your father and your kids
and got bit by the snake.

1893
01:58:41,420 --> 01:58:43,003
And now he's struggling for his life.

1894
01:58:43,045 --> 01:58:45,503
He's the guardian angel who came to
save your family.

1895
01:58:52,430 --> 01:58:59,283
How did I miss knowing that Eeswaran
is my son?

1896
01:59:07,329 --> 01:59:08,962
Dad, please be careful.

1897
01:59:09,029 --> 01:59:12,362
Periyasamy sir, there's no danger
to Eeswaran's life.

1898
01:59:12,462 --> 01:59:15,295
In two hours he'll be shifted from ICU
to the general ward.

1899
01:59:15,337 --> 01:59:17,670
Everyone can meet him. Okay.

1900
01:59:27,127 --> 01:59:28,586
Eeswara!

1901
01:59:30,628 --> 01:59:35,920
I came to know only now that
you're my son.

1902
01:59:36,253 --> 01:59:37,420
Please forgive me.

1903
01:59:39,253 --> 01:59:41,212
- My son.
- Don't worry.

1904
01:59:41,753 --> 01:59:42,587
Uncle.

1905
01:59:42,670 --> 01:59:45,295
Dad, why are you crying?

1906
01:59:45,337 --> 01:59:46,962
He's out of danger.

1907
01:59:47,003 --> 01:59:48,003
Once he gets back home...

1908
01:59:48,045 --> 01:59:50,253
we'll go as family to our deity's temple
and offer prayers.

1909
01:59:50,295 --> 01:59:50,920
Okay!

1910
01:59:50,962 --> 01:59:52,962
One goat won't be enough for you.

1911
01:59:53,029 --> 01:59:54,696
Kutty Puli, we'll sacrifice two goats.

1912
01:59:54,753 --> 01:59:56,587
Buddy, you forgot about Godzilla.

1913
01:59:56,878 --> 01:59:58,545
Then let's sacrifice Godzilla.

1914
01:59:58,587 --> 02:00:00,712
Then we can invite the entire village
for the feast.

1915
02:00:13,670 --> 02:00:15,212
- Here you go.
- What is this?

1916
02:00:16,096 --> 02:00:17,805
This is my hard-earned wealth.

1917
02:00:17,837 --> 02:00:19,503
Please use this to pay off your debt.

1918
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:22,087
Use the balance money to start
a new business.

1919
02:00:22,253 --> 02:00:24,295
- Please take it.
- No...

1920
02:00:24,337 --> 02:00:25,545
Come, take it.

1921
02:00:26,295 --> 02:00:28,503
Take it as a gift from a brother
to his sister.

1922
02:00:31,462 --> 02:00:35,003
Brother-in-law, we're ready to
forgive you.

1923
02:00:35,404 --> 02:00:37,154
You just be ready to reform.

1924
02:00:38,628 --> 02:00:40,378
Forgive me, Eeswara.

1925
02:00:41,628 --> 02:00:44,253
Sister-in-law, they're calling you
and brother inside.

1926
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:46,892
You will be seeing me as a new man.

1927
02:00:47,795 --> 02:00:49,545
- Listen, they're calling you.
- Buddy!

1928
02:00:50,336 --> 02:00:51,252
Hello!

1929
02:00:53,328 --> 02:00:54,203
What happened?

1930
02:00:55,514 --> 02:00:56,806
When did it happen?

1931
02:00:59,088 --> 02:01:00,672
Okay, I'll inform dad about it.

1932
02:01:01,744 --> 02:01:02,986
What happened?

1933
02:01:05,232 --> 02:01:08,107
The astrologer who came to our house, died.
