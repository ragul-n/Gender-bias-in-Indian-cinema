You go surround this way

Yes.

It's okay.

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,650
And then the buildup, okay...

Come on,
is it you to fight with these again?

39
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,036
Won't you give me even a single chance?

40
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,560
Shouldn't I bash up atleast one guy?

41
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,416
- You should respect seniors, man.
- Please brother... Please brother.

42
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,690
You come out of the dream first.

43

- Come out, come out of it

Come out.

- Hey! Get up!

What bro, you disturbed me
when I was in a great dream.

00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,060
What are those fights and chases?

50
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,716
Will you suppress me and
hype up your heroism?

51
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,440
My dream and I'll have it as I like.

52
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,840
I'm the hero in my dreams brother.

53
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,020
If you want,
have your own dream and hype yourself.

54
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,100
What do I hype?
Tell the real fact to the audience.

55
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,680
You go surround this
way and let's corner him.

I don't know anything.
That Venky did everything. Encounter him.

- Please leave me.
- Hey...

61
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,120
- What?
- Brother you?

62
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,520
What man, what do you get by killing me?

63
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,710
Brother the cops...
Oh my god!

64
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,330
- Ah... A bike... Come on, let's go.
- Hey bike! Okay brother.

- Hey... Hey...
- Bro... bro... bro...

66
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,520
What's this man?

67
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,319
Oh no bro...
It's very heavy and I won't carry.

68
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,440
You won't carry?
What's this weight for your size bro?

69
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,810
You went up,
down did skids in dream and said nothing.

70
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:03,810
That's dupe brother.

71
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,820
What, a dupe even in the dream?

72
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,319
- Brother we escaped nicely.
- I can smell police...

73
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,966
- however far they are?
- Brother we are trapped.

75
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,390
Brother, everyone surrounded
us. Please give any idea.

Three on the right...

77
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,070
Super brother...

78
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,540
Four more on the left.

79
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,280
Super plan brother, carry on.

80
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,590
You take the lead first.

81
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,460
Keeping you as a bait on the left,
I'll attack from right.

82
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,810
Come on...

83
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,260

Ah... Oh god!

84
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,250
These fellows are hitting hard bro!

85
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
You hit, rascals?

86
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,356
Listen, I'll say a plan such
that each would go crazy.

87
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:47,940
You say fast brother.

88
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,920
- Hey, take four steps back.
- I did...

89
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,226
- Raise your hands up.
- Raised them...

90
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,600
Not like that...
Not after you are beaten, like this.

91
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,600
Bend your knees down.

92
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,220
- Kneel down man.
- Okay.

93
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,420
Kneel down.

94
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,946
- We're surrendering boys.
- Knelt down.

95
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,140
We'll sit and talk, please.

96
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,850
Come on... beg them boy.

97
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,310
I went for a dream as
original was unbearable bro.

99
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,680
How much do we wait here brother?

100
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,930
Viswanath, from Indian Embassy.

101
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,510
- I came here to interrogate you.
- Hey, Telugu person...

102
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,860
Are you from Telangana, sir?

103
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,060
Maybe from Andhra.

104
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,120
From Yanam.

105
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,060
Oh, a Union Territory!

106
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,390
- Liquor is very cheap there, boss.
- Is that required now?

107
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,810
[metal chair clinks]
Sorry brother.

108
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,910
Bloody.

109
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,230
Being Telugu guys, you
harass two Telugu girls...

110
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,190
Are you not ashamed?

111
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,710
One from them is my wife.

112
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,490
Another one is my fiancee.

113
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,600
- Ah?
- Hmm...

114
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,550
- Your wife.
- Yes.

115
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,190
- Your fiancee.
- Yeah.

116
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,690
Why'd they file a case on you?
What exactly happened?

117
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,300
To narrate about a history,
we say before Christ and after Christ.

118
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,560
To say about a man, it's before
marriage and after the marriage sir.

119
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,470
They say marriages are made in heaven.

120
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,210
But my marriage was
made in a marriage bureau.

121
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,750
You know whose
marriage are we setting today?

122
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,351
Venky, who is depending on
our bureau since past two years

123
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,060
and Harika for whom no bureau is
able to set a marriage from two years.

124
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,750
We are going to fix their marriage.

125
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,470
Even the normal looking girls
are easily getting married.

126
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,880
What's does this girl lack sir?

127
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,476
She's got everything in high doses.

128
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,810
The girl is a Software Engineer.

129
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,126
Her father is a bank manager and
has taken a Voluntary Retirement.

130
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,260
- Hi.
- Hi.

131
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,560
They say smart girls are less in brains.
This girl is high on that too, man.

132
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,700
Congrats Harika,
you completed the project successfully.

133
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,870
Keep it up.

134
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,290
I don't need your compliments.

135
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,810
First give me a salary hike.

136
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,270
If not,
I'll look for another job by next month.

137
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,920
She's very calculative sir.

138
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,150
- Is it?
- Yes.

139
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,310
See here, again.

140
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,770
Umm... the coffee is very good Lakshmi.

141
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,450
I don't need your compliment,
but I need a hike.

142
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,970
Increase my salary,
if not I'll look for another house.

143
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,050
Let's take off the washing
machine and you wash.

144
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,330
Let's take off the vacuum
cleaner and you sweep.

145
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,930
Save the power like that
and I'll increase a hundred bucks.

146
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,780
No need madam, what's now is enough.

147
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
[chuckles]

148
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,460
Very convenient sir,
typical Indian woman psychology.

149
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,010
Family is more typical.

150
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,780
- Let's see that directly.
- Yeah!

151
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,590
Unable to bear the
torture of these oldies,

152
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,200
I thought to give up supplying milk.

153
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
There are two grannies inside, be careful.

154
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,880
Why is he scaring us as
if there are two dogs inside?

155
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,380
- Hey oldie...
- Hmm...

156
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,720
- The house's gone dull, why don't you die?
- Huh?

157
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,830
Whole house would get happening
with the relatives gathering around.

158
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,340
You ask me to die?

159
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,580
That's why,
your husband has died committed suicide.

160
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,940
Your husband died
jumping into the river Ganga.

161
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,550
- She's always lamenting...
- Stop your mess mother-in-law.

162
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,080
What did I say dear,
your mom is asking me to die.

163
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,670
Mom... Who are you?

164
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,876
From the marriage bureau madam,
we came regarding your girl's match.

165
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Please come...

166
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:55,890
Oh!

167
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,650
Whatever we say about the boy
would be less. He is the MLA's PA.

168
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,770
Then PA would've earned
more than the MLA, right?

169
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,150
- Why don't you talk anything?
- Thats right! Right!

170
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,166
Well... They say there isn't an auspicious
time after some days, so if we could hurry

171
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,310
What's the big deal?
Let's talk and fix once daughter is back.

172
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,480
- Why don't you talk anything?
- Thats right! Right!

173
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,880
Hmm...
I think the decision lies this side.

174
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,246
Please call the girl, madam.

175
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,420
I'm on my way. Inform everyone.

176
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,500
- Okay. I'm coming.
- Dear Harika...

177
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,076
They are from marriage bureau.

178
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,620
- She is my daughter.
- Hello Madam.

179
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,170
Hello Madam.

180
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,880
Mom, how many times have I said you,

181
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,720
not to have such during the working days?

182
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,230
It's marriage mom, it's about life.

183
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,950
We shouldn't take decision in a jiffy.

184
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,790
Didn't we wait for two years?

185
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,440
Plan it in the weekends and
we shall discuss in detail.

186
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,200
Your opinion will change by
listening about this match.

187
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
What's so special?

188
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,380
There are no ladies to dominate you.
I mean, the boy has no sisters.

189
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,480
Whatever you say and decide is
final at your in-law's house

190
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,480
There are no in-laws and
the boy is an orphan.

the film Attarintiki Daredi]

00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,450
What shall we do mom?

193
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,080
Having good wealth is enough to
become Ambani's daughter in law.

194
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,726
But you really have to be lucky to
become daughter in law of such a house.

195
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,200
Mom, order sweets in Swiggy.

196
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,670
One to two parlor, two to three
power nap, marriage fixing at four

197
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,790
and the marriage should
be done within four days.

198
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,390
Sometimes, we can take
a decision about marriage in a jiffy.

199
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,580
Can that boy bear with such a girl?

200
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,080
The boy is innocent.

202
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,550
You were along with us.

203
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,310
You bought a costly house than
that MLA being with him, Venky.

204
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,890
What can I tell you sister?

205
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,166
We should better ourselves
while there's a chance, right?

206
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,666
It's just the wedding that's pending.

207
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,640
If God permits you, which type of
wife do you prefer among us, Venky?

208
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,570
Do I need god's permission? No, no...

209
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,880
I've got high expectations, not you...

210
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,531
Whom would you give the chit fund here?
Say at least that.

211
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,870
- I won't give
- Why?

212
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,636
She took the money for
the necklace last month.

213
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,116
And then she took for the
education of her kids.

214
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,460
Looks like my marriage is on cards,
so I'll take the money.

215
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,140
If you can wait a bit,

216
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,716
I'll get my daughter married to you,
after her education son.

217
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,479
Hey... What's she is studying sister?

218
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,186
About to pass her ninth
and is coming to tenth.

219

Hello! Nothing,
just came to pickup our MLA sir's PA.

222
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,540
Will this happen anywhere in the history?

223
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,120
Why don't you go and inform at TV9 office?

224
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,600
Sir, I'll go have biscuits and come.

225
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,310
Didn't you just have breakfast?

226
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,446
I have sugar sir,
I should eat something every hour.

227
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,870
What if someone kills me meanwhile?

228
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,956
At least give me those chit
fund money the next month.

229

Sir... sir...

230
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,850
You are superb Venky, you brought down
four rupees a kilo using your MLA's name.

231
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,250
I'll get you discount at Narsingi for
your blouses and falls by using his name.

232
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,100
Thank you Venky.

233
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,070
- Okay Venky, bye.
- Okay, bye.

234
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,350
- Venky...
- Oh sir, when did you come?

235
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,200
I came when you were talking about
discounts on blouses and falls...

236
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,190
Right then.

237
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,766
Ladies Sir, ten votes per family
and there are elections soon.

238
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,930
Is it... you analyse well, Venky.

239
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,800
But this isn't our constituency you know?

240
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,480
Hey, come on...

241
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm the MLA, Venky.

00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,900
Enough of this...
You said some shopping mall opening?

243
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,176
- I'll just go, get ready and come.
- Okay go.

244
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,876
Why did you have such a man
instead of removing him from job sir?

245
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,180
- Who are you?
- The driver.

246
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,126
You're giving me advices
and why didn't I remove you?

247
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,150
Yes sir, why didn't you?

248
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,469
They won't fire drivers and
PAs in the houses of great people.

249
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:31,940
Why sir?

250
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,176
Because you know about all our loopholes.
Go and start the vehicle.

251
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Okay sir.

252
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,076
Sir, they called you as chief
guest as you are the MLA.

253

There don't have a chain in the
neck or rings on the fingers.

254
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,496
Please wear something sir...

255
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,720
Actually, I fear they may
steal as there's a huge crowd.

256
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,120
Come on sir, am I not wearing?

257
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,640
- You also have a gun man.
- Oh!

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,940
Hey, give those chains
given by my mother-in-law.

heroine for the opening?

260

dominate us, Venky.

- Oh no, are you okay sir?
- Sir!

268

Will a man let go of
humanity seeing a lady, Venky?

269
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,220
Won't they see that a
human is under their feet?

270
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,800
What's this blood on your neck sir?

271
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,370
You gave two thick chains, right?
They stole them.

272
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,350
- Hey, I'm an MLA.
- So what?

273
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,470
- Where are you from, idiot?
- Why will I say?

274
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,830
Strange people.

275
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,810
You haven't noticed, but someone
stole the chain even from your neck.

276
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,891
I took care and put it inside
myself when the public came.

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,120
Thank God, my chain is safe.

278

Where did you go?

281
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,316
I have a low BP right sir?

282
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,146
As it was suffocating in the crowd,
I went in and sat in the AC room.

283
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,350
- Ah!
- Oh...

284
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,096
- You appointed him right?
- He has some family problems.

I've got a great match.

291

The match making is at 4'o clock
in the evening. Don't just come alone.

292

on behalf of you as an elder.

293
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,060
I got it.

294
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,450
Will you give me the
space to change my dress?

295
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,100
Dear, saree isn't rumple right?

296
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,150
Either a man or the sari should go
crushed after a lady has it on right?

297
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,100
I'm the MLA dear.

298
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
- Sir!
- Yes.

299

Who else do I have than you, sir?

300
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,666
Whatever you say is final but this
match shouldn't go missed out.

301
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,890
Why to bring in a trouble with three
knots? Is this marriage needed now?

302
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,060
I'm not like you.
I know how to control my wife very well.

303
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,700
- Is it Venky?
- Yeah

304
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,250
Come on, say it again.

Who's he? Looks like the rubber
stamp on my office table.

314

The boy's height, weight and age...

315
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,180
Silence, you shouldn't ask such things.

316
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,050
Okay.

317
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,870
Let's see how he talks and sings...
Come on sing a song dear.

318

Okay.

319
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,706
You're clearing the throat,
will you sing now or what?

320
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,106
Why should we singing
being from the groom side?

321
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,110
Why are you bothered if he doesn't mind?

322
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,740
Dirty faced rascal is commenting.

323
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,470
- I'm the MLA madam.
- So, what?

Who is this OLX pieces?

325
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,179
Come on, they're old people and they
keep asking. We shall adjust, right?

326
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:22,740
It's okay.

328
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,070

- I won't get the song without lead.

330

Venky, sit.

331
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,310
Oh no, she's so beautiful.

332
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,810
Hey baby...

333

Hey baby...

334
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,730
- Please be seated.
- Venky, be gentle.

335
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,056
You shouldn't wipe like that.

336
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,870
She'd sit, you come and be seated.

337
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,250
- Sit...
- Okay.

338
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,170
We're the groom side,
we should be stubborn.

339
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,400
We have just two girls.

340
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,970
The elder one is working.

341
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,030
As the two old ladies would disturb,
we joined the younger one in a hostel.

342
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,511
Then ain't it them who should
be going to an old age home?

343
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,040
Ask the girl anything if you want to son.

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,200
Who else do I have than you?
Whatever you say is final, ask her...

345
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,260
They say your working...

346
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,800
No idea how my timings
would be with the boy.

347
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,320
So, it's better you give
up your job after the marriage.

348
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,390
Oh no, I'll handle it

349
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,650
Why do you bother about job?

350
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,779
We'll take care after the marriage,

351
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,176
that's the self
respect matter of the girl.

352
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,606
Who else do I have than you?
Whatever you say is final, ask her...

353
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,630
I'll ask.

354
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,790
Do you know to cook or...

355
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,310
Oh no, I'll talk...

356
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,930
We'll order in Swiggy if she doesn't
know cooking or go to a restaurant.

357
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,096
Which generation's questions are these?

358
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,369
Is an umpire needed for a
match thats fixed already?

359
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,230
Who else do I have than you?
Whatever you say.

360
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,430
Ask the elders something.

361
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
What'll you give the boy?

362
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,450
We ordered Laddu and also
prepared Tamarind rice already.

363
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,510
Laddu and Tamarind...

364
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,840
Sir, better you avoid tamarind
as I have a gastric problem.

365
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,780
- Hey, will you please get out?
- Okay sir.

366
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,630
Huh! Laddu it seems!

367
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,730
Not for eating, but we are
asking about the presents.

368
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,520
Come on, we just have two girls
and everything we have is for them.

369
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,490
- What do you have?
- Whatever we have...

370
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,120
Huh?

371
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,870
Look elder son in law,
my anklets are for you...

372
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,660
Even my ear rings are for you.

373
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:27,660
Eh?

374
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,530
You can't bear with these brains.
Let's leave Venky.

375
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,350
Dowry?

376
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,510
- And Before everyone...
- Oh no!

377
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,716
Being an MLA, if you ask for dowry they'd
put you behind bars under section 498.

378
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,040
Me?

379
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,140
I like the girl. If she wants
to ask me anything, let her ask.

380
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,140
I'm already sitting on the marriage stage

381
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,500
and searching out for
the rings in the tumbler.

382
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,020
And I won in that.

383
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,700
Hey, the same!

384
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,276
I too have got the seat for our
kid at the corporate school.

385
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,190
MLA Sir has said to give one
Lakh for the donation too.

386
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,090
Are you using me for
the next generation too?

387
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,400
"Like the heaven slipped on to the earth"

388
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,190
"Like the stars dropped into the hands"

389
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,150
"Like flowers showered in the heart"

390
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,980
"So much fun..."

391
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,060
"So much fun..."

392
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:57,020
"Like teaching songs to the Peacock..
Like the Cuckoo danced on the branches."

393
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,690
"Like the new tunes are born"

394
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,650
"So much fun..."

395
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,600
"So much fun..."

396
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,320
"Is it Kalidasa's book and
the song of Tyagaraja..."

397
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,480
"Are mixed and sung ant once by the heart"

398
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,160
"Beautiful thoughts and
never ending hopes..."

399
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,350
"Are like jumped all around"

400
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,650
"So much fun..."

401
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,600
"So much fun..."

402
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,960
Finally smile and tie the knot son.

403
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,750
Tie the knot with a smile son.

404
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,300
Why did I hear it differently?

405
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,210
[camera captures]

406
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,650
Hey, I need a solo photo.
Everybody, please go down...

407
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,650
Hey, photographer! Take off brother
in law and capture just two of us.

408
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,650
What's this?

409
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,900
Maybe she didn't like
you. I liked you, right?

410
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,560
You're not the range of honey,
right? Honey is the best.

411
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,730
[camera captures]

412
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,446
I thought you'd come in a
saree for the first night.

413
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,260
- This dress?
- This is comfort Venky.

414
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,810
Oh, if you're comfortable then it's fine.
Please take your seat.

415
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,770
Seat belt! We'll fly off.
Fly off yeah... Yeah!

416
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:41,260
"The naughty mirror counting
a bindi every day..."

at the time I go out"

419
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,070
"Is enhancing my life time"

420
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,110
"Fragrance of jasmines reminding
about the time to go home"

421
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,050
"Filling new celebration in the eyes of
naughty girl waiting outside the house"

422
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,780
"So much fun..."

423
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,710
"So much fun..."

424
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,390
- Eat son...
- Enough...

425
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,070
- Son, fish is fresh.
- Have the fish.

426
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,179
- I have cooked everything freshly for you.
- Eat this dish son.

427
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,040
Eat without hesitation
don't leave anything.

428
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,260
God you are great man.

429
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,270
Watch the film, Venky...

430
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,230
You watch and I'll watch you.

431
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,386
With the overdose of love we
show in the first days marriage,

432
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,810
wives will sit high on the Everest.

433
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,990
We are casually at the bottom.

434
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,620
They would neither come
down and we can't climb up.

435
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,820
In this gap,
a few new rights too start in them on us.

436
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,470
Expectations!

437
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,950
How's it Venky?

438
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,580
Yeah, it's good.

439
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,430
Yuck! It's so bad.

440
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,390
Why not say bad when it isn't good?

441
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,320
Be open Venky,
this is the only thing I expect from you.

442
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,820
Oh, okay.

443
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
How's it Venky?

444
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,160
It's too oily and salty.

445
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,060
Why do you say so rudely?
I prepared for you working hard.

446
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,220
Why not say fine with some concern?

447
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,206
This is the only thing I expect from you.

448
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,820
Huh?

449
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,760
How many times shall I say not to
put the towel on bed after bath?

450
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,516
- You left on the used socks on the couch.
- On the couch.

451
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,346
- You don't off the lights, fans.
- You don't off the lights, fans.

452
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,886
- Won't you have this much of discipline?
- Won't you have this much of discipline?

453
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,766
- This is the only thing I expect from you.
- This is the only thing I expect from you.

454
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,790
Past digging!

455
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,580
Comparing past with the present,

456
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,440
they say you've changed
and play football with us.

457
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,150
Hi Harika...

458
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,310
You said movie at 6'o clock
and came at 9'o clock.

459
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,040
I was a bit busy at office.
You'd have reminded me at 4'o clock?

460
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,940
I never reminded till now.

461
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,286
Why are you digging past things now?

462
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,310
Did you get Surf Excel?

463
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,040
Oh damn...

464
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,600
Hey, no problem.

465
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
I have a very important
meeting tomorrow at office.

466
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,590
My Saree isn't ready. Thanks

467
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,090
Okay, have you brought at least Jasmines?

468
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,690
[sniffs]
Bedroom.

469
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,950
You won't remember my movie or Surf Excel
but never miss out bringing Jasmines...

470
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,070
Venky, you've changed.

471
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,970
Earlier in a movie,
you used to watch only me

472
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,860
but now you're watching the film.

473
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,510
Venky, you've changed.

474
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,080
Earlier, you used to be in the kitchen
with me. But now you aren't.

475
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,030
Venky, you've changed.

476
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,919
- For everything you...
- At least Surf Excel...

477
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,770
Ladies own up something very much
from all the fights taken place.

478
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,200
They apply that in every
fight, like this Surf Excel.

479
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,170
Changes do come in
respect too after a few days.

480
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,880
Harika, all are in the fridge.
Why not heat them up and keep outside.

481
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,780
Come on, adjust a bit for today hubby.

482
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,546
You used to serve everything
fresh when newly married

483
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,220
and it's all stocked food now.

484
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,160
Fresh it seems!
Are you fresh like back then or what?

485
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,440
To escape myself from this frustration,

486
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,910
I invented an excercise myself
and that is Venky's excercise.

487
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,320
- Do we need to to roam in MLA's car?
- I made him buy the car for us, to roam.

488
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,750
Hello!

489
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,480
Won't you wish the new neighbours?

490
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,390
Hello...

491
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,230
I think you won't take
good care of your wife.

492
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,770
- Huh?
- How do you know?

493
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,300
As you are making your wife
carry the entire luggage...

494
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,436
I carried it all through the shopping,
she's just carrying while getting down.

495
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,050
Look at me, I'm carrying the entire load.

496
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,490
Wives man, follow me...

497
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,010
See, that's called love and caring.

498
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,966
- Come in, I'will teach you the lesson.
- Who is he? a new frustration.

499
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,346
- Why do you care when he said something?
- Are you caring about me? You've changed.

500
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,120
You go to the office and...

501
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,330
If they get angry,
they throw the things around them on us...

502
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,876
But it's enough if we just
raise our hand in anger...

503
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,470
They use an atomic weapon on us.

504
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,870
You will hit and kill me?

505
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,936
What? It's you who threw the knives and
all. I just raised my hand. That's it.

506
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
[siren]

507
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,030
You know where is that
sound of weeping heard?

508
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,120
[groans]

509
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,656
- Not that Harika...
- Harika said everything to me.

510
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,076
- Please listen once to me also.
- It's all my daughter's fate.

511
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,876
- Not that mother-in-law...
- We kept our dearest baby in your hands...

512
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,240
You're torturing at your
will making her innocent.

513
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,660
As a Psychiatrist what I feel,
ladies are very sensitive at heart...

514
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,510
Either they irritate us or torture,
[phone rings]

515
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:30,450
should treat them with love,
and with patience...

[phone rings]
Even after disconnecting many times...

517
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,026
Why the hell do you call so many times?
Are you any dying?

518
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,450
How many times did I say not to
call when there's the client?

519
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,550
Should I cook rice or Chapati for lunch?

00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:43,860
Chapati!

522
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,640
My hands will pain. I won't make
Chapati but will prepare rice.

523
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,096
Why did you call me after
taking the decision yourself?

524
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
I'll kill you...

525
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,120
Don't call me when I'm in working, okay?

526
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,580

527
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,810
- No problem. This isn't for me, have it
- Venky, where were we?

528
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,600
- As a psychiatrist what I feel...
- Come on, let's leave.

529
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,540
- Ladies are very soft hearted...
- I'll kill you rascal...

U-turn with this cab's entry.

Hello...
Why did she come in with the suitcase?

534
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,506
The food at the hostel isn't good,
so she'll stay in our house from now.

535
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,186
She said brother in law doesn't
suit my pride and Honey is the best!

536
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,356
Then, why did she come to my house?

537
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,290
Sister, is this brother in
law's house and not yours?

538
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,910
Huh?

539
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,450
Oh no, why are you looking like that?

Honey is the best!

Younger one is more dangerous
than the elder sister.

543
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,900
Wonder what happens to the
guy who's going to marry her.

544
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,440
I'm that unlucky guy...

545
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,270
Honey!

546
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,310
- I'll narrate my own story.
- Go on.

547
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,870
To narrate a history, it's like before
Telangana and after Telangana...

548
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,400
Hey brother, why discuss on that now?

549
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,516
Come on brother,
you have got great knowledge

550
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,220
and say a lot like
before and after Christ.

551
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,410
But I just know only this.

Kantakka's son Varun Yadav
in Borabanda is a blast...

He works a lot,
eats and roams around with friends...

Sleeps late and wakes up
late in the morning...

Mom, why are you laughing so loud
early in the morning like Nagababu?

563
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,040
I am watching Jabardasth program
recap, son... it is so funny.

It'll be done if we get
a letter from MLA sir.

Okay, where's dad?

568
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,060
I asked him to cut onions,
no idea where he's gone.

569
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,780
If you put spices in the beans
and cook, it tastes good.

- Do you know how to?
- Daddy...

00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,766
Then, why don't you cook and show me?

572

- Come on, man.

679
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,240
See, my babe will do a blast.

[mumbling]

681
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,831
- Is she doing any black magic?
- Come on, it's a warm up.

[gargles]

684
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,740
Then, what's this?

685
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,080
Hot water... to clear the throat.

686
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,400
Samajavaragamana...

[classical vocals sang bad]

688
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,270
She sounds like the old
scooter of your dad.

[classical vocals sang bad]

690
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,120
Is she begging?

691
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,400
[classical vocals sang bad]

692
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,320
Is she catching hens?

693

[classical vocals sang bad]
[whiplash]

696
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,310
Why are you beating up like that?

697
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,700
I feel like dying to her without this sir.

698
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,700
Samaga... samaga... samosa...

699
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,240
Samaga... samaga... samosa...

700
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,280
Samosa?

701
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,450

Stop it!

705
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,190
Didn't you like it, Varun?

706
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,090
Fantastic, you rocked it.

707
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,990
Honey is the best!

708
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,710
What will we do now, sir?

709
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,866
- Why do you ask me sir?
- Okay, what about a dance?

710
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:47,380
[whiplash]

711
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,020
Do you still have hope? Okay!
Let's watch even that horrible thing too.

Moon walk!
[Michael Jackson - They don? t care song]

714
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:02,050
This isn't like Moon walk dance,
but is like a old lady's dance.

715
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,570
Tiger dance!
[Michael Jackson - They don? t care song]

716
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,370
What dude, I feel itchy all over my body

717
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,180
and feel like hitting
myself with a belt?

718
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,190
- Sir, belt.
- Hey...

719
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,990
[whiplash]
[sighs]

720
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,590
Veena step, Veena step...

721
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,670
- Oh my God!
- No Honey dear, you step down.

722
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,350
Come down... Come.

723
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,739
Why you stopped me,
I was doing fine right?

724
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,340
Not that, I thought some practice and...

725
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:28,190
You crazy,
I've been practicing from 15 years.

726
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,810
Hey, you stay calm idiot.

727
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,766
Hitting like Pothuraju from
the celebration at village.

728
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,100
Honey...
not now but for the next Anniversary...

729
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,580
You too are stamping down my talent.

730
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,200
I hate you. I don't love you.

731
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,776
- Hey...
- I'm breaking up with you. That's it.

732
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,686
Honey dear, You don't get
worried for such a small thing.

733
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,710
I'll make you get onto the
stage and see who stops.

734
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,176
Who made her get onto the stage, idiot?

735
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,266
I'm almost getting a stroke even
when sitting in the staff room.

736
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,926
- Principal sir, how are you?
- Greetings sir.

737
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,350
Hey Varun, what are you doing here?

738
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:54,120
Sir, she's our girl and a bit for
the Anniversary and that stage...

739
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,620
Come on man, it's the matter of
lives of so many kids and parents.

740
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,660
Okay sir.

741
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,996
- When you wrote a letter to Sarala madam.
- Even for Jyothi madam also.

742
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,920
- When her husband came to hit you...
- Stop it!

743
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,800
Will we let such things come open or what?

744
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,830
- Hey...
- Yes.

745
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,910
Let it be so for now...

746
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,190
Sir, how can it happen like that?
[whiplash]

747
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,450
If she gets onto the stage I'll
commit suicide hanging myself.

748
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,550
Hey, I'll dance in front of
your corpse when you die.

749
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,380
Raise the curtains.
[whiplash]

750
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,810
Raise the curtains.

We've the nationals next month at Delhi
Take me even there and we'll try, okay?

understand what you speak in happiness.

Leave me for now..

Yes, I got you.
Come, I'll teach you the lesson now.

- Honey.

- Oh my God! Honey show me.
- I'm so happy.

792
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,960
Not about the cups but say
about the mistakes you did.

793
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,796
Who was that boyfriend who
dropped you home on the bike?

794
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,806
What boyfriend, brother in law?
He was the Ola bike guy.

795
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,470
Is it! We give money to the Ola
bike guy but do we give hugs, dear?

796
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,060
I think he have seen me...

797
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,690
See sister, you said not
possible for you to see my program

798
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,066
and brother-in-law would come, right?

799
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,570
He hasn't come, you know he
never cares about your word.

800
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,670
Oh no...

801
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,680
You never care about my word, right?

802
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,836
I had a small work at office.

803
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,710
When my Surf Excel was...

804
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,776
Huh, stop your Surf Excel
nuisance like some coffee and snacks.

805
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,326
She got down with some
boyfriend and what's your nuisance now?

806
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,350
Yes, mine is a nuisance.

807
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,030
Not that, some boyfriend dropped her.

808
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,660
- Are you any mad?
- Yes, I'm mad.

809
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,680
Oh no, why do you let go the
important matters and hang on to the tail?

810
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,630
You don't have a head.

811
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,426
- Yes, I married you right? No head.
- She is hanging again to the tail.

812
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,850
Okay brother-in-law, arrange
the cups and I'm going to sleep.

813
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,210
You diverted the whole topic
and ask me to arrange the cups?

814
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,410
You dirty cups...

815
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:33,950
Oh no! Please no dear...
Siren... Family... Finish... Please no!

816
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,870
You don't cry, they'd come again...

817
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,090
Oh no, She's come. Oh no, even these too.

818
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,610
- Hey broked my cups.
- Why are you torturing my daughter?

819
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,710
Are these any fools to
torture? They are criminals.

820
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,450
You're drying down the juicy babe.

821
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,499
Instead of making her cry so,
why not bless her with a baby?

822
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,900
When you're in my house here 24/7,
how would I bless with a baby? My foot!

823
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,976
When he's not considering the age while
talking, why don't you talk hubby?

824
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,640
It's right, correct? It's right, correct?

825
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,420
Should I scold you,
beat you or should feel pity...

826
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
Hello!

827
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,470
Here, he comes

828
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,670
My wife...

829
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:20,030
When she asked just for ice cream,
I'm getting it all the way from Charminar.

830
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,030
Should you get into my house and say that?

831
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,210
Just like that...
They're wives man, I thought you'd follow.

832
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,850
I have no luck even for Surf
Excel and ice cream again?

833
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,501
- Oh god! It's all my bad luck.
- You're happy now, right?

834
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,240
Dirty idiot...

835
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,630
No need of following
so much, you carry on.

836
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,070
Enough for today.

837
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,389
Brother-in-law doesn't like
me to stay in his house, mom.

838
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,656
Crazy girl, this isn't brother in
law's house but is of your sister.

839
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,460
Yes, our house...

840
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,386
You have good calculations in this,
but won't talk about her mistakes.

841
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,760
What mistakes, son?

842
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,166
She's going to the college and
roaming around with some boyfriend.

843
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,436
She stays in my house and don't
I have the responsibility?

844
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,970
Son-in-law, if you doubt my daughter
it's like doubting my whole dynasty.

845
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,370
Yes, our dynasty is like fire.

846
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,636
Yes, thus you put my house on fire.

847
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,340
Ok son,
prove that my daughter has a boyfriend

848
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,020
and then I, my daughter and
whole family would be at your feet.

849
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,490
Tell again mother-in-law...

850
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:15,600
If you prove it I, my daughter and entire
family would be at your feet. That's it.

851
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,820
Stand on the same word mother-in-law.

852
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,780
Note the date on the calendar.

853
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,860
I'll prove that your younger daughter
has a boyfriend in the next two days,

854
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,700
I'll put your elder daughter in control

855
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,580
and will be the boss
for your whole family.

856
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,150
Promise... Promise... Promise...

857
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,820
Honey, we have committed.

858
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,890
You don't have a boyfriend, right?
- No.

859
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,950
Thank God.

860
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,160
[indistinct chatter]

861
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,000
- Yes, show a bit to the left.
- Hi dear...

862
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,726
- Did you eat dear?
- Show a bit to the left.

863
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,100
Time...

864
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,126
Life would be so in the
early days of marriage,

865
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,431
and would become like this
after that. Look into the work.

866
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,700
Camera is on the backside sir,
he cannot be seen.

867
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,090
You may escape from the camera
but can't escape from my eye.

868
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,760
- MLA sir...
- Who are you, sir?

869
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,880
I should MLA sir for the hotel permission.

870
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:06,900
Do you have the PA permission?

871
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,950
- PA?
- PA?

872
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,740
Hey, you know what this is?

873
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,940
Recommendation letter
from Corporator Yadagiri sir.

874
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,570
- Who is the PA now? Move.
- Move without making nuisance.

875
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,360
No respect at the wife at
home and this fellow again now...

876
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,150
Hello, stop.

877
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,086
- Where are you going and who are you?
- I need to meet MLA sir.

878
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,391
To meet the MLA you need PA's
permission and I've no mood.

879
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:25,570
- Mood?
- Mood?

880
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,820
Are you kidding?

881
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,460
- Are you my co-brother to make fun?
- Who knows, I may become if time permits.

882
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,660
- Hey...
- Hey!

883
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,500
Why are you laying hands man?

884
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:36,610
If I make one phone call gangs come
from every street and break your bones.

885
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,220
Hey... Hey... Hey...

886
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,310
Bring as many as you can.

887
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,520
Any centre, any time, single hand...
Venky!

888
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:46,546
Dude, he said Venky's dialogue from
Ganesh movie and you say PK dialogue.

889
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,580
Look my dear PA,

890
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,330
not when to win but we
should know when to be subtle.

891
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,820
Then I'll win and you get subtle, come on.

892
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,446
Not a sentiment dialogue man,
you shall say the action dialogue.

893
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,590
I remembered this now, dude.

894
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,900
Why's he getting frustrated so?

895
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,109
Does he have any wife's torture at home?

896
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,230
Hey! Why do you talk about wife, idiot?

897
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,730
Hey! Don't mess with me.

898
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,260
- With me too.
- I have high BP.

899
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,690
I too have BP.

900
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,900
Hey, why this nuisance
dude? Show that letter

901
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:19,580
- Corporator Yadagiri sir recommendation.
- What Corporator Yadagiri, my foot.

902
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,606
[phone rings]
My decision is final here.

903
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,950
- Hey, I will kill you.
- Hello...

904
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:23,740
Where is Varun?

905
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,376
[glass breaks]
He's into a fight here at MLA's house.

906
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,240
You know, I'm gold belt in Karate.
Share the location and I'm coming.

907
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,386
- Kara... Gold belt in Karate...
- I will peel your skin.

908
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,410
Hey!

909
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,720
Hold on... What's happening here Venky?

910
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,446
- We're fighting.
- We're fighting.

911
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,470
Are you fighting?

912
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,650
If you fight your limbs should break
but why's my furniture being damaged?

913
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,080
What's the problem Venky?

914
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,040
It seems he'd meet you
without my permission.

915
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,960
Your permission to meet me?

916
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:48,800
What's your problem, man?

917
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,300
He tore away Corporator Yadagiri
bro's recommendation letter.

918
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,520
Yadagiri?

919
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,496
That idiot has no entry inside the gate
and a recommendation letter from him?

920
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,520
On duty sir.

921
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,469
Hey, when such a mess was
on here where did you go?

922
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:59,916
I have piles, right Sir?
I went to drink coconut water.

923
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,790
Hey,
tell me a disease which you don't have.

924
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,126
I don't have Seizures sir
but am expecting soon.

925
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,339
Oh, you wish to be alive till then?

926
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,906
Why does he feel diseases are some awards?

927
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,190
Yes, I'm the MLA and should
do public service often.

928
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:09,450
- Okay, you carry on man.
- That is.

929
00:44:09,451 --> 00:44:10,770
Okay,
you do it all without informing right?

930
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,036
Hey, call the press sitting outside.

931
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,610
- I'll open up his entire history.
- Hey Venky, no, no...

932
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:17,940
I said in the market, right?
About our loop holes.

933
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:18,780
Correct sir...

934
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,450
It goes so having such guys on job.

935
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,070
- What are you talking again?
- Hey...

936
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:22,880
You catch my collar again...

937
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,959
- What are you talking about rules?
- Hey, I am an MLA man...

938
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,230
Hey! You may have seen girlfriends
who make their boyfriend spend.

939
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:35,660
But you may haven't seen a girlfriend like
me who gets angry when he is in trouble.

940
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,050
If I see you, you will go to ICU.

941
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,960
I've heard this voice somewhere...

942
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,560
Hey, show up your face.

943
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:49,300
Hey dear, I have heard this voice
somewhere. Show me your face.

944
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,020
Show me your face.

945
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:51,290
Hello...

946
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,940
We won't show our face to
you. Maintain some distance sir.

947
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,540
You come on, Varun...

948
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,830
Hello...

949
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:00,040
We're Thugs of Hindustan,
Kabhi Kushi Kabhi Gam.

950
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,640
I'll get MP's recommendation next time.

951
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,716
What Honey,
why did you drag me out so from inside?

952
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,746
It's my brother-in-law inside.

953
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:07,490
He saw you dropping me at home
in the night and made a big mess.

954
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:11,090
That means, he is become an obstacle for
both my personal and professional life?

955
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,130
I'll teach him a lesson.

956
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,250
Come on, give his number.

957
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,150
[phone rings]
Hello...

958
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,420
Hello Cobra.

959
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,740
Cobra... Why are you scolding, idiot?

960
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,310
Hey, Cobra isn't filthy language,

961
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,456
but means co-brother.
I'm your sister-in-law's lover.

962
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,480
Hey, where are you?

963
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,230
What man,
it seems you challenged to catch us?

964
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:31,460
Hey, I'll slip like Mercury
if you try to catch us.

965
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,030
I'll slip into the burrow.

966
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,590
Hey, I'll fly away over the seas.

967
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,590
- Where'd you fly away, Cobra?
- Where ever...

968
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,520
- Hello!
- Hello, my foot! I'll beat you up.

969
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,390
You both together cheat me inside?

970
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:47,670
When you shout loud at
their compound near their gate,

971
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:48,816
won't they listen to that, dude?

972
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,316
If you really are such a
great hero to give warning,

973
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,740
go to Borabanda circle and give it.

974
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,766
It seems would fly on the
seas and slip into the burrow.

975
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,430
You and your dirty old villain dialogues.

976
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,270
Why are you staring so angrily, sir?

977
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,320
I'm after all a side kick friend sir.

978
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,310
Look there sir.

979
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,390
Bye brother-in-law.

980
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:07,010

981
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,500
- Stop rascal...
- He is coming, move.

Honey... come fast...

984
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,440
Come in...

985
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,290

Hi Cobra, there's dog in this house.

If that sees, none till date
escaped without getting bit by that.

990
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:31,916

You leave, I'll take care.

996

You think it's so easy to deal with dogs,
man?

You too are a male dog, right?

998
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,980
As a man,
listen to the troubles of this man.

- Yes, this one.
- Hey Honey...

1012
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:54,780
Why did you bring me to your house?

1013
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,296
Sister is busy at office and
brother-in-law is busy with dog.

00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,490
Let's talk happily for some time.
Come...

1015
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,460
- Talking means...
- Come on...

1016
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,660
Hey Honey wait...

1017
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:06,490
Come...

1018
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,910
- Where is the bedroom? Where is it?
[screaming]

1019
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,090
What's this?

1020
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,940
You said we shall talk, right?

1021
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,590
Not so loud, but a bit softly.

1022
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,200
Come, hug me and kiss me.

1023
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,640
Now you're booked.
[camera captures]

1024
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,450
To catch you,
I attached the CC cameras to this phone.

1025
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:47,876
Please brother-in-law,
don't tell to sister.

1026
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,326
- Oh no, what an acting?
- Please brother-in-law.

1027
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,820
Okay brother,
we should overlook at all such things.

1028
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,446
See you, Honey dear. I am leaving sir.

1029
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:56,320
Hey bro, where will you go?
I have a lot of work with you.

1030
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,660
You played badly bro.

1031
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,850
You make me run? Get me caught to the dog?

1032
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:02,330
I'll get you caught to her family,
dangerous than the Dog

1033
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,550
Come on, nothing happened and you get
me caught to the family just for this sir?

1034
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,986
We shall settle in
between us if there's anything.

1035
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:11,830
What bro, Do you think am I
watchman at Indira Park to settle?

1036
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,190
Just this footage is enough.

1037
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,299
Revenge on you, avenge on him,
frustration over your mom and sister...

1038
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,300
All will be gone...

1039
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,820
One shot and all birds die...

1040
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,490
Harika...

1041
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:23,450
Mother-in-law...

1042
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:25,360
With family.

1043
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,740
See,
you said your sister had no boyfriend.

1044
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,170
Come on, see this.

1045
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,970
I caught red handed
when they were kissing.

1046
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:33,310
Hello Grannies...

1047
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,830
See, you said your dynasty is fire,
pickle and rust...

1048
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:43,670
I'll crush down you...

1049
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,390
Mother-in-law, do you remember?

1050
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,210
You said whole family will be
at my feet if I prove, right?

1051
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:50,820
I'm the King from today
and all are the slaves.

1052
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,020
Bonded slaves.

1053
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,370
Hey Harika,
shoes from now will be on the bed

1054
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,410
and socks will be on
the sofa in this house.

1055
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:59,330
They will be everywhere
and in any position.

1056
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,076
Take out the servants
in the house from today.

1057
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,830
Your mom and this OLX
batch is here, right?

1058
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,180
Authority and decision are
mine in this house from today

1059
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,370
I'll peel the skins if
you cross your limits.

1060
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:12,570
What say father-in-law?

1061
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,170
Thats right! Right!

1062
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:15,180
- Isn't it right?
- Yes...

1063
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:15,850
Yeah...

1064
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,670
Why did she btrap up this way?

1065
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:20,810
Looking at son-in-law's flow, he's
like playing football lifelong with us.

1066
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:21,570
What shall we do now?

1067
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,960
Let's cover it up saying
we know this before itself.

1068
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:26,150
- Mom, it's wrong.
- No way..

1069
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,060
What are the dumb signals?

1070
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,246
Hey Cobra, they've gone dumb
with the shock I've given.

1071
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:33,810
What's there to go dumb in this?
We know about this long back.

1072
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,730
Why so much mess?

1073
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:40,370
We know long back that my
sister has a boyfriend.

1074
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:51,110
You cooked up this story just now as you
may have to lead lives at my feet, right?

1075
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,730
Why cook up stories?

1076
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,540
We called the boy for introducing
him to you. Promise on my Husband.

1077
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,760
Thats right! Right!

1078
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,300
Harika, I'm your husband and I've lost.

1079
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,820
I'll be at your feet
but need just one truth.

1080
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,400
When you knew Honey had a
boyfriend, why did you challenge with me?

1081
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,350
Just like that, Venky. We tested
to see whether you'd catch or not.

1082
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:14,970
Oh God...

1083
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,030
Won't you ever give a chance for
a husband to win over the wife?

1084
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,980
It's wrong dude,
too much injustice is going on.

1085
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,660
Leave about what our son in law says,

1086
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:24,910
- Are your mom and dad at home dear?
- Yes Aunty.

1087
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:26,990
Oh, do you have?

1088
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,660
What's that?

1089
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,570
I mean, we shall call them for
engagement if they're there.

1090
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:32,770
Engagement?

1091
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,980
Varun come...

1092
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:35,670
- Mom...
- Bless me aunty.

1093
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,450
Sister...

1094
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,090
- Dad...
- Please bless us.

1095
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:39,150
Grannies...

1096
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:41,070
What's this Cobra?

1097
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:44,540
You torture such a such a kind family?

1098
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:46,999
I didn't like and it's no way good.

1099
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,070
He's so always, Varun.

1100
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,230
- Even that Surf Excel matter...
- Hey, stop.

1101
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:51,920
Huh?

1102
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,750
Yes, all have come along and
only I am an outsider now.

1103
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:55,600
Enjoy...

1104
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,270
Enjoy and I'll go out.

1105
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,150
- Venky...
- No.

1106
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,350
- Venky...
- No.

1107
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,760
Bring cool drinks and sweets
for all, while you returning.

1108
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:06,770
Come in... I will teach you.

1109
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,966
I'll inform brother-in-law
that you just came to know.

1110
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:10,460
- No... No.
- No... No.

1111
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,130
Cool! Cool...

1112
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,860
Cobra, I was worrying how to
settle this inter caste marriage.

1113
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,270
You helped me a lot.
Love you Cobra... Love you!

1114
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,770
- Hey, though an enemy, you are a man.
- Is it?

1115
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:25,250
That cute smile is very good in your face.

1116
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,570
But it won't remain so after marriage.

1117
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,010
Listen to me and say no to marriage.

1118
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:34,820
Cobra, please see to that cool drinks
are chilled and more ghee in the sweets.

1119
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:36,566
I'll go and discuss about marriage.

1120
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:37,250
- Oh!
- Come fast

1121
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:38,450
Hey, Honey...

1122
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:40,750
Hmm...

1123
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,150
He's gone in and he has it now.

1124
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:47,680
They would chew him away,
stamp him down, eat him up.

1125
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,000
Now fun for me and frustration for him.

1126
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,786
- Greetings, go in...
- Greetings MLA sir...

1127
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:54,480
Yours is fine but even
for your sister-in-law?

1128
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,010
Am I the MLA for this
constituency or for your family?

1129
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,380
[tires screeching]

1130
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:03,370
Greetings aunty.

1131
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,800
My mom and my dad.

1132
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,520
- I am his friend.
- Greetings.

1133
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:10,740
You just agreed without any second thought
after knowing that your boy is in love,

1134
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,510
You aren't a normal guy.

1135
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:15,690
What is she saying son?

1136
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,010
Same timing.

1137
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:17,980
Hello...

1138
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,830
Elder daughter and elder son-in-law.

1139
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:22,080
PA and PA's MLA.

1140
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,830
- Come inside.
- Same flow

1141
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,840
Okay.

1142
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:28,910
Brother, think once again.
Do you need this marriage?

1143
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,180
I'm not like you, I have
capacity to keep my wife in control.

1144
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:33,040
- Huh?
- Eh!

1145
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:34,270
- Hey...
- Hey.

1146
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:35,840
- Phone...
- Shoot the video.

1147
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:36,850
Come on say it again.

1148
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:40,990
I'm not like you and have capacity
to keep my wife in control.

1149
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,500
- How did I say, dude?
- Great.

1150
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,740
Keep is safe.

1151
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:46,750
- Now he has it inside.
- Yes, he has it.

1152
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:49,380
Elder son-in-law, go that way and sit.

1153
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:51,200
Sit that side. Go man...

1154
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,466
Younger son-in-law sit here.

1155
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:53,650
Sit there son...

1156
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,160
Old son-in-law is become
cheap once the new one is in.

1157
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,686
- Are you watching serials?
- Hey, father.

1158
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,216
You have started serial chats even here?

1159
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,740
We came here for match fixing father.

1160
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:02,290
- Even here!
- What is he, Mom?

1161
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:07,260
Whole house is lighted up after
younger son-in-law is entered.

1162
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:09,890
He'd get ruined just in the next 6 months.

1163
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,370
Why to mess with those OLXs, Venky?

1164
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:13,980
Okay.

1165
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,630
Aunty, Honey's exams are done.

1166
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,840
Now we've decided to get her married.

1167
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:21,210
We brought her with great pampering
and now putting her in your hands.

1168
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:24,270
It's just me talking
and why don't you talk?

1169
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:26,230
Thats right! Right!

1170
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:30,490
Huh! Oh no! Why have I become like this?

1171
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:32,746
Why did you too become a rubber
stamp like that fellow, Venky?

1172
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,090
I too am into the same shock sir.

1173
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,830
- Stay like that...
- You!

1174
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:44,690
Cool... Cool...

1175
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,610
Mom, if you have something to ask, go on.

1176
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:52,270
Whatever you say is final for me.

1177
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,780
Look, our food is not full without
non vegetarian. You cook well, right?

1178
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:02,340
Aunty...

1179
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,500
I will manage.

1180
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,500
Mom,
won't you cook if it is your daughter?

1181
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,226
- What have I said?
- Leave about that cooking.

1182
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,840
Whatever you say is final.

1183
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:11,780
Look, you should be
traditional like this after marriage

1184
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,700
and that Jeans,
T-shirt won't work with me.

1185
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,500
Hey, Honey dear...

1186
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:19,730
I'll manage.

1187
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,660
Hey, how is the trend these days and
which generation questions are these?

1188
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,030
Same formula...

1189
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:26,420
Same screenplay and in
fact same genre too...

1190
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,230
- I'm seeing me in her.
- I'm seeing me in him.

1191
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,156
Talk to the elders if you have anything.

1192
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,376
What will you give to the boy?

1193
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,060
Almond Halwa, Cashew nut sweet
and we got even Biryani prepared.

1194
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:37,790
What is this, son?

1195
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,440
They improved the menu, right?

1196
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,266
I came to know that I have
even ulcer recently sir.

1197
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:42,456
What shall we have in place of Biryani?

1198
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,190
Take some poison and I'll get freed.

1199
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:44,920
- Get out, idiot.
- Okay sir.

1200
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,990
Not to eat, but am asking about the gifts?

1201
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,740
I'll say about that aunty.
They just have two daughters.

1202
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,860
Where'd everything go,
it's all for them both.

1203
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:53,440
- What's there?
- Whatever is there.

1204
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,450
They don't reveal that!

1205
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:56,390
Nothing less in looks.

1206
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,650
Younger son-in-law, my anklets are yours.

1207
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,220
My ear rings are yours.

1208
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,420
Oh no!

1209
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,076
Rings and anklets have gone that way,
Venky.

1210
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,340
Come on sir, are they any
ornaments of Anantha Padmanbha?

1211
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,230
They're wearing from 60 years.

1212
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,796
They would have been worn
out to half a gram by now.

1213
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:08,350
Yes, logic.

1214
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,270
Varun, what are so many questions?

1215
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:12,920
I'm multi talented and
haven't you informed your mom?

1216
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,130
Honey is the best.

1217
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:16,020
Sing one song dear.

1218
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,586
Hey, I'll die if she sings that again.
I can't bear and am leaving.

1219
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,560
Hey, don't go anywhere.

1220
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:23,930
At least you say her to sing, son.

1221
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,460
It's better that you're at
the wall than to be here.

1222
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:27,650
Shall I go, then?

1223
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:28,850
Shut up and sit.

1224
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:29,946
- Okay...
- Hey, Honey dear...

1225
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:30,890
Wait! You wait...

1226
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,780
Come on, let her sing bro. I wanted
to witness her talent from long back.

1227
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,980
- Yes!
- I too love songs.

1228
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:35,810
You sing dear...

1229
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:38,296
Come on, should she sing right today?
There's Marriage and Sangeeth ahead...

1230
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,586
Hey priest, there's a common
dialogue for you in such scenes and

1231
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:41,150
why are you not saying that?

1232
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,510
The time is here, exchange the offerings.

1233
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,570
[chants]

1234
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,820
Same Vasthu, I too stood right there.

1235
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,460
You'll soon be back to the pavilion.

1236
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:54,760
[camera captures]

1237
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:00,600
I arranged a great party in
the engagement happiness.

1238
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:01,670
Cobra, come...

1239
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:04,506
- Great toddy milk have it.
- No, I don't need.

1240
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:06,580
What, you need your wife's
permission for this too?

1241
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:09,110
Hey, what are you talking?

1242
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:12,070
Wife's permission for me,
what are you saying man?

1243
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,270
Bro, wife is like the
controlling ropes on the horse.

1244
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,390
It should be on the
hand, you let it go brother.

1245
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,060
- What, me?
- Yes.

1246
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,160
Hey, Harika...

1247
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,160
Harika...

1248
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,850
Why is she not coming?
Hey Harika!

1249
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:34,520
Why doesn't she reply even when
you're screaming so much brother?

1250
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,446
- Why is there no sound?
- You left it off brother.

1251
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:37,150
Where did I leave?

1252
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,670
Hey, you stupid... Where are you?

1253
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,800
Hey Harika, why don't you respond
when I'm calling from so long?

1254
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,680
Oh no! Are you drunk or what?

1255
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,960
- We just...
- Tried that.

1256
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,320
- You tried... Oh no!
- They just have tried that's it.

1257
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:53,940
What's wrong in that brother?

1258
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:54,760
They are ladies brother.

1259
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:57,890
Bro, high class people drink in josh
and the low class drink when happy.

1260
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:59,510
What did our middle class do, brother?

1261
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,280
Brother, it's toddy and our culture.

1262
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,750
Sister-in-law, Honey... Go on...

1263
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,360
Go on?

1264
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:18,210
"The brain is revolving round..."

1265
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:31,200
"Hey go on, go on..."

1266
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:35,450
"Hey go on, go on..."

1267
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:39,110
"It's on high pace..."

1268
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:42,700
"It's on high pace..."

1269
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:47,070
"Earth down is on the
top and sky up is down"

1270
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:50,900
- "They had drink and lost their ways"
- "Their way..."

1271
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:54,740
"With a difference are dancing for
a song being behind each other"

1272
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,240
"My mind is blown and
could see the stars..."

1273
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:02,400
"The brain is revolving round."

1274
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:10,150
"Shall we blow the balloon?"

1275
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:35,600
"It's like my body is floating in the air"

1276
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,750
"Size zero feels so,"

1277
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:43,550
"Oh my beautiful lady"

1278
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,560
"It's like I'm taking a horse,"

1279
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:51,460
"Ride"

1280
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:56,110
"The centre of the heart beats with speed"

1281
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,930
"Do the ride"

1282
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,739
"Where did the Sun go
in the sky at night?"

1283
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:07,580
"He gave VISA to our
privacy and went on USA tour"

1284
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:11,370
"Why did he shine bright from the window?"

1285
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:14,860
"Indra is taking a photograph of you"

1286
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:19,060
"The brain is revolving round"

1287
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:26,570
"Shall we blow the balloon?"

1288
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:07,920
"My words have been rolling"

1289
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:15,740
"Let's make full noise
and rock n roll today"

1290
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:23,250
"My glass is saying cheers"

1291
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:30,850
"Even that's into romance
seeing you with glass eyes"

1292
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,650
"I'm going left or right,
though am standing steadily"

1293
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:39,530
"I'm standing ready and will
you a lift, come on dear"

1294
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,320
"Though am feeling shy from
top and feeling thrilled within"

1295
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:47,090
"What've you seen, there's lot more"

1296
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,860
"The brain is revolving round"

1297
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:02,570
"Shall we blow the balloon?"

1298
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:10,360
"Shall we blow the balloon?"

1299
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,676
- Why haven't they come still?
- What do I know.

1300
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,460
They said to come in 10 minutes.

1301
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:20,200
- No time sense, nothing.
- They have started early.

1302
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:21,790
- Hello...
- They would be here mom.

1303
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,160
Care about you opposite
house people too, man.

1304
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:27,030
Wow, so many sarees.
Is there any occasion?

1305
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,530
Any idiot would buy for occasion
and this is just like that.

1306
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,700
I bought as I received salary.

1307
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,396
- Have you ever bought a saree in salary?
- He's overacting and...

1308
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:36,850
Hello...

1309
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:40,630
- They're wives, follow me...
- I know.

1310
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:41,110
You come.

1311
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:42,626
To hell with him and his suggestions.

1312
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:44,176
Sorry sister-in-law,
traffic is too high in our area.

1313
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,850
- No problem, please come.
- Come in...

1314
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,010
Here's mom.

1315
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:51,790
Honey...
Shop freely and buy what everyone needs.

1316
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:52,600
Okay.

1317
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:55,250
See our guy's management sir, wow.

1318
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:57,540
We may make two enemies
get along taking to a bar,

1319
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,140
but two ladies taken to
a saree shop... no way...

1320
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,900
Oh no, there is no such scene.

1321
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,240
- See...
- Yeah! Let's see.

1322
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,140
What range shall I show madam?

1323
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:13,660
For aunty, right?
Show in a very high range.

1324
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:14,940
Mom, did you listen?

1325
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:18,190
See this madam.

1326
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,030
Not good.

1327
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,656
- See this colour.
- It's good... Good...

1328
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,680
It is looking good right?

1329
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,910
- Not good at all.
- Isn't good right.

1330
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:27,240
- Isn't this looking nice?
- This is latest madam

1331
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,916
- Will take this one dear.
- Oh no, green colour...

1332
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,016
This won't suit at all for you.

1333
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,610
More, further more...

1334
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:33,550
This is not good.

1335
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,470
- Oh my God! Wow.
- Too good aunty.

1336
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:38,150
- This is beautiful aunty.
- This one?

1337
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:41,046
But this isn't of the range you asked
for, madam. The rate is too less.

1338
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:44,200
Forget about the rate man.
This saree will be so good for her colour.

1339
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:47,940
What is this son? Buying low price
saree She is talking about my colour?

1340
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,180
And you are sitting quiet?

1341
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,766
- Mother wait, I'll talk.
- Will you talk to her or not?

1342
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:53,090
Yes!
That's just the beginning and see now...

1343
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:55,950
Aunty, mom's saree is of so less price...

1344
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,180
They aren't the saris
to wear forever right?

1345
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:00,610
They are worn rarely and put
back in the almirahs, right?

1346
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:03,750
- Man... Pack this one.
- Madam? Okay madam.

1347
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:06,180
Aunty, now you choose for us

1348
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:07,930
- Have you seen Panipat war?
- No sir.

1349
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:09,200
See Kanchi silk war now.

1350
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,560
What range do I show now, madam?

1351
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,940
Show from the range they have taken.

1352
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,500
See this madam.

1353
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:16,610
It's very good.

1354
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:18,176
Already I have the same colour saree.

1355
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:18,790
This is good.

1356
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:21,666
- Already I have the same colour, aunty.
- Already I have the same pattern, aunty.

1357
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:24,560
- This looks great.
- Already I have this model.

1358
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:26,820
They say so till they take what they like.

1359
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:28,999
Hey, this is superb.

1360
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,266
Aunty,
already I have this same border saree.

1361
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:33,010
How do we know what you have
or not? Take whatever you want.

1362
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,540
Look there... That is, that is my family.

1363
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,380
It's Okay...
she is my daughter in law, right.

1364
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:51,230
What's this son? 5000 Rupees saree for
me and they are buying so costly ones?

1365
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,449
If we don't ask, they keep
commanding. Ask and don't be calm.

1366
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:57,216
- See now... I will talk them.
- You have to ask.

1367
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,110
He's gone angrily now, right?
He'll come back getting compromised.

1368
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,640
- Thats right! Right!
- What a timing uncle.

1369
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:02,930
- It's looking nice right?
- Very nice...

1370
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:03,500
What's this sister-in-law?

1371
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,586
Okay for the bride but mom is feeling
even if you bought in such high prices.

1372
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:07,190
What's this Varun?

1373
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:09,950
You always give the card and
leave and now what's this new habit?

1374
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,360
Is it your mom's training? You've changed.

1375
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,600
It isn't that we have never
seen such saree's Varun.

1376
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:16,650
When she asked with love, we are taking.

1377
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:20,070
They aren't the saree's regularly
worn, we wear them very rarely.

1378
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:23,766
- So cheaply for the saris... I can't...
- Sister-in-law...

1379
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,270
It's all the bad luck of my daughter.

1380
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:28,190
Why bad luck mother-in-law?
You go on happily with the shopping.

1381
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,300
What did I say? What did I say?

1382
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,060
Mom,
when there's a good thing to happen...

1383
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,040
We should take them along and move on...

1384
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,826
You got the wife now,
right? You've changed.

1385
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:37,690
What are you into that
nuisance chats? Move on.

1386
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:40,520
Mom, come upstairs.

1387
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:41,900
I won't come, son.

1388
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,920
I can't bear with your
mother-in-law and your sister-in-law...

1389
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:46,396
I'll pay the bill and leave. You go...

1390
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,420
- Hey!
- Go...

1391
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,640
Mom says can't come, you carry on.

1392
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:51,990
It's wrong Varun.

1393
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,550
All would feel like we
kept you in our grip.

1394
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:57,350
It's never there in our families
to keep husbands in our grip.

1395
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,250
Correct, right? Correct, right?

1396
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,320
Mom, come please...

1397
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,840
Hey, go man. Even if I come,
they take only what they like.

1398
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,670
- Come on, don't torture me.
- What should I do coming there.

1399
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,226
They will take whatever you like.

1400
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:17,410
Come on aunty, we liked two sets
and you select what you like.

1401
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:19,200
These uncuts look good.

1402
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:21,466
- Diamonds are better for my colour, aunty?
- Actually...

1403
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:22,490
What did I say, son?

1404
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,860
They take what they like and
why me in the middle again?

1405
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:26,616
Sister-in-law, what's this
nuisance again after mom has come?

1406
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,880
- Take what has mom selected.
- Okay, pack the uncuts.

1407
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,160
Why are you
compromising? Diamonds are good.

1408
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:32,490
- Good, right?
- Yes...

1409
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,500
Pack the diamonds.

1410
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:40,700
- Sir... Sir...
- What if they are diamonds or uncuts?

1411
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:42,650
My money my marriage why do you care?

1412
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,160
Sir...

1413
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,920
We're dealing with our problem?

1414
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,376
- Why do you interfere in between?
- Hello Cobra, show your face.

1415
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,550
Here, this side...

1416
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,330
Hello, this way... Come on, yes...

1417
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:53,180
That's the frustration on your
face, right? Frustration...

1418
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:54,386
What's your nuisance in between again?

1419
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,880
I had no love before
marriage and had six months edge

1420
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:59,310
and for you...
No way Added a family as the bonus.

1421
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:01,580
Three 'F's will soon go
missing from your life.

1422
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,790
Friends, family and freedom.

1423
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:08,610
And just one thing will be left
behind with you, frustration...

1424
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,870
Frustration...

1425
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:12,780
That's it. Okay...

1426
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,590
Okay boy...

1427
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,940
Hello, what?

1428
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:19,686
You came this way early in the morning?

1429
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:20,746
My sister is getting married.

1430
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:23,130
Great people like you should
come surely for this marriage.

1431
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:26,360
Just the card and no gifts?

1432
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,720
How could we come without the gift?
Here...

1433
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:30,600
Your second wife and your second son.

1434
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:39,620
You always came to my house and said my
wife, ice cream and follow and I followed.

1435
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:41,750
I never expected you'd follow so closely.

1436
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:44,390
Go and say hello to daddy. Go... please go

1437
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:47,156
Wow, the frame is beautiful and
same dress. Where did you buy it?

1438
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:47,980
R. S. Brothers.

1439
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,080
Wow, the same shop...

1440
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:51,080
See now and play.

1441
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:51,600
Give me.

1442
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:53,990
Your frustration will now start.

1443
01:07:58,190 --> 01:07:59,190
- Cheers dude.
- Cheers.

1444
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,490
Hey, why does that Cobra say so?
He says friends would get cut.

1445
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,636
How you can get cut for me?
You're my childhood friend dude.

1446
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,100
[phone rings]
Phone from Honey, dude.

1447
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:09,940
Leave it.

1448
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,320
Hey, come on lift it please dude.

1449
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,360
I won't lift at all.
[phone rings]

1450
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,660
She's called again

1451
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:17,910
Let's answer.

1452
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,390
- No need...
- Why?

1453
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,710
Look, the queen is here.

1454
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:26,290
- Honey dear...
- Shh...

1455
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:29,670
You cut Honey's call enjoying
with this waste fellow?

1456
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,160
You've changed Varun.

1457
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:32,780
Hey! Give it to me...

1458
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:36,170
Honey dear, when I was about to lift
your call, this idiot didn't allow me.

1459
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:38,930
Where is this fellow?

1460
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:44,880
Either love or marriage,
is it the friends to be scape goats?

1461
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,930
Honey is the best.

1462
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:54,240
Hey Darshi, said it right? Friend
will be cut and the first F is gone.

1463
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:56,490
You said it perfectly sir.

1464
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:57,420
KANTAKKA BIRYANI CENTER

1465
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:58,110
- Varun...
- See, my son.

1466
01:08:58,210 --> 01:08:59,976
- Named the restaurant with my name.
- Hey Honey!

1467
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
HONEY BIRYANI CENTER

1468
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,456
What son,
you replaced my name with her name?

1469
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,270
- Okay, you do the opening...
- Oh god! How good it is...

1470
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,746
- Huh, let me at least do the opening.
- She kept her huisband in her command.

1471
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,010
Oh my god!
[indistintive voices]

1472
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:12,476
What is this son?
You replaced my name with her name

1473
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,860
and now she's cut even the ribbon.

1474
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,600
Hello Cobra, I said right?

1475
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:20,750
Second F is cut... Family is cut...

1476
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:22,626
- Wait for third F...
- Yes you were right.

1477
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:24,600
Freedom gone, all gone...

1478
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,330
What's this son? You aren't yet
married and listen to your wife?

1479
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:28,670
Didn't you remember your mom?

1480
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:31,830
You've changed Varun, you didn't
take me for wedding card selection.

1481
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,330
You're for sure a Mamma's boy.

1482
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:35,640
Yes,
you forget mom after getting the wife.

1483
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,780
You don't remember about mom being here

1484
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:39,920
and you always keep
talking to her on the phone.

1485
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,980
Let's shift to separate house after
marriage. I can't be with your mom.

1486
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,190
You do as your wish, idiot

1487
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:47,370
What you're doing I've no...
- Kill us, rascal... Kill us...

1488
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:51,710
[indistinct voices]
[screaming loud]

1489
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,380
Hey...

1490
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,410
What's that drinking like
you're in a scarcity?

1491
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:08,710
I'm not like you. I know well
about how to keep wife under control.

1492
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:10,750
Wow, what a performance bro?

1493
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,890
What an expression, come on please repeat.

1494
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,040
Once again, for my sake...

1495
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:18,220
I'm not like you. I know well
about how to keep wife under control.

1496
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,760
You said to know how to
control wife and what happened?

1497
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:21,860
What happened man?

1498
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:23,550
- Cobra...
- Say, what dear?

1499
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:27,770
I feel to melt down in your
tight hug like a chick, Cobra...

1500
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:32,110
Hey what is he saying chick
and all, I don't understand.

1501
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:34,530
That is,
the boy needs you to console him sir..

1502
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:36,000
You mean consoling?

1503
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,900
- Exactly.
- Hey come man, come bro.

1504
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:38,730
I'm here right?

1505
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:40,300
- Hey relax, no...
- Cobra...

1506
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:41,650
- Tell me, what happened?
- Cobra...

1507
01:10:41,651 --> 01:10:43,436
- How did you bear for six months?
- Leave the past man...

1508
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,430
Cobra... I'm going mad just in six days.

1509
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:48,900
How was I? When said my lungi
came off, I gave them all a shock.

1510
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,010
I was like a bomb and now am out Cobra.

1511
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,290
Cobra, I am getting frustration...

1512
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,526
- I am getting frustration
- No... No frustration.

1513
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:59,870
It's very dangerous.
It's very dangerous. Relax... Relax...

1514
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:01,836
- I've a temporary medicine.
- Give it here Cobra.

1515
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,326
- No... no man. No man!
- Give it here...

1516
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:06,890
It isn't a drug but it's Venky Asan...

1517
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:08,990
Venky Asan.

1518
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,590
Okay, all frustrated boys listen here.

1519
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:15,020
All Venky fans, Mega fans
and other fans... Get up.

1520
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:17,920
Hello you, you and you from
the audience come on get up...

1521
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,200
Come on do this, follow me.

1522
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:24,820
- How is it Cobra?
- Cobra! It's great.

1523
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,530
Yes, that's a great relief.

1524
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:28,370
What, what's your problem?

1525
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:31,910
Rice or Chapati, prepare something
idiot. Is that any national issue?

1526
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:35,910
When I came to this pub to have a
peg peacefully, what are these calls?

1527
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,920
What, isn't the maid come?

1528
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:40,490
So, you want me to come and sweep?
To hell with my life.

1529
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:44,150
- Ladies are very soft hearted... Not that.
- Cobra, what is this wild frustration?

1530
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:46,216
- It's better he visits some Psychiatrist.
- Hey!

1531
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,480
He is Albert Narayan Das man...

1532
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:48,970
- A famous Psychiatrist.
- Is it?

1533
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:50,596
What happens to this city, Cobra...

1534
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:52,740
Brother, it's an interesting
topic. Come on, sit down.

1535
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:55,970
You see Cobra, I studied a lot
about the ladies mindset in YouTube.

1536
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:57,930
This is a man's brain...

1537
01:11:58,110 --> 01:11:58,730
- Okay?
- Okay!

1538
01:11:58,930 --> 01:12:01,380
It is like a Chess board into boxes.

1539
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:02,340
Okay?

1540
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:06,260
If suppose issue is at mom,
we be right in mom's box.

1541
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,350
Thinking about mom...

1542
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:12,180
For example, if we go into the office box,
we stay right there messing with the Boss.

1543
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:13,190
- Okay, that's all.
- Yes, right.

1544
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:14,810
But if it is a lady's brain.

1545
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:16,186
- Will even that be like a Chess board?
- No, no!

1546
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:17,930
That's where you are
mistaken. Crazy brain!

1547
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,150
Wait, I'll tell you exactly.

1548
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,100
It's like a big circle.

1549
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:23,230
- Boxes?
- No.

1550
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:26,950
No boxes, it's only this.

1551
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:28,980
What's that brother it's like a jungle?

1552
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:31,376
It would be like a jungle and
that's why it is a woman's brain.

1553
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,270
Suppose, we talk mom's matter
being in the box right?

1554
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:38,150
And these jump from mom to
office, from office to home,

1555
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:41,850
from here to there,
there to there and so on...

1556
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,290
- I am getting frustration Cobra...
- Oh no...

1557
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:46,980
- Frustration...
- Use Venky Asan...

1558
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,080
Come on...

1559
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,456
You've been smoothly
continuing your family...

1560
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,830
even such a messy atmosphere means.

1561
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:57,110
- Hey men... You're machos...
- Hats off brothers

1562
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,240
Cobra... You analysed greatly.

1563
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:03,110
I don't need all this,
put me out from this.

1564
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,900
No, I can't. I just write the reviews.

1565
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,710
Positives, negatives and bottom line...

1566
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:08,870
But we need a cunning
brain for our problems.

1567
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:10,340
Hello...

1568
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,310
Are you still alive?

1569
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:15,030
They almost had tried killing me.

1570
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,270
I mix poison in the milk

1571
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,480
I mixed rat poison in the juice.

1572
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:23,660
We decided to kill you
right here on the spot.

1573
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,700
You would happily be gone if we kill so,
right?

1574
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:27,580
- That's we both together.
- Together...

1575
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:30,340
Decided to show you a hell for lifelong.

1576
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:35,310
We with just one wife
and you with two wives...

1577
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:37,500
Oh God, what a plan and what a sketch...

1578
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:40,330
That's why I gave up
going home for three days.

1579
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:44,920
Hundred calls from SIM 1 and
Two hundred calls from SIM 2.

1580
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:46,980
I understood one point here.

1581
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:50,790
Wives have a need with the husbands.

1582
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:54,560
- I understood another point there.
- What?

1583
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,450
I am going to Europe for three months.

1584
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,780
Oh no, what's my situation now?

1585
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,250
Oh no, what happens to my husband now?

1586
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:08,280
Thinking what would be their life now,
wives would come to our feet.

1587
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,710
Brother, this idea seems good.

1588
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,670
Will this formula work out even for us?

1589
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:13,570
Once, we get into the flight...

1590
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:17,440
Smile is ours and they'll
be left with weeping.

1591
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,860
Kick is ours and they'll have trouble.

1592
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,650
Fun is ours and frustration is theirs...

1593
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:28,550
Yea!

Oh, is he the guide who misguided you?

1600
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:55,910
If you put a chair even for me,
we can continue the rest of the story.

1601
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:58,280
Yes, continue... What happened then?

1602
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,300
What to continue, sir?

1603
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:00,346
Take of these shackles first.

story for free of cost.

- Yes bro.

Oh no, I too am seeing them.

Dude! Give some idea to escape.

1659
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,350
Urgently take some covering and escape.

1660
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:07,720
- Thank you...
- Thank you.

1661
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,750
When I said something, you pull off mine?

- Venky...
- Varun...

- Run, faster brother...
- Venky stop!

There wasn't any phone or message.
Where do we search for you?

informed that you were here.

How did you feel like running
away from the marriage, Varun?

least once all these days?

be happy like before.

your importance in your absence.

we came to know the mistake we've done.

01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:53,006
Why are you still here saying compromise
brother? Let's patch up with a nice hug.

1678
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:54,180
- Harika!
- Come Honey dear.

1679
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,210
- Okay brother...
- Brother...

1680
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:03,130
[laughing mockingly]

1681
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,480
- You believed it?
- You too believed it, right?

1682
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:08,370
The visual in mind is different.

1683
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:11,920
I thought you'd come running
from far, fall on my feet,

1684
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,770
- Wash my feet with few tears.
- Wash...

1685
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,850
Sprinkle some on your brow and thought you
would say to be at my feet for life long.

1686
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:19,320
Visual didn't match at all.

1687
01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:21,526
- Bro, even my visual didn't match at all.
- Haven't matched?

1688
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:25,700
I felt to make her come around Europe when
she holds my legs and I pull her away.

1689
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:29,060
You came all the way to Europe from India
and can't you come here from so near?

1690
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:30,070
Can't you?

1691
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:31,950
- Hi...
- Hi...

1692
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:33,486
- Hey, how do you doing?
- Hey girls...

1693
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:34,600
Everything fine.

1694
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:35,670
Are they yours?

1695
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:36,900
- Zandu Balm.
- Tiger Balm.

1696
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,300
Your wives?

1697
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:40,500
- Oh, nice guess!
- Wow...

1698
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,200
- What a guess.
- What a judgement girl...

1699
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:42,820
- Bye...
- Bye...

1700
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,020
Okay, see you bye.

1701
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,380
- This is our life.
- We are having fun.

1702
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,310
So, match to our visual and come okay?

1703
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:49,960
Venky, there's a very important,

1704
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,840
- At least listen to that.
- Oh no brother.

1705
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:53,190
I'm into shivers...

1706
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:54,630
She's showing fingers, right?

1707
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,070
What's this man,
your sister-in-law is frightening.

1708
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:57,680
- What is this brother?
- Oh my god!

1709
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,016
Will she twist us like Kamal
Hassan from Bharatiyudu film?

1710
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,360
You made us cry so much, right?

1711
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:02,730
God exists.

1712
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:05,370
You'll get ruined.

1713
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,920
- You'll get ruined.
- You'll get ruined.

1714
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:10,280
- God exists and will punish you.
- He'll punish you.

1715
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:20,489
I thought you'd melt down but
you gave a great shock, man.

1716
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:21,810
Why are they cursing us?

1717
01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:24,480
Curses from wives won't work.

1718
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:27,360
Both my wives keep cursing
me hundred times a day...

1719
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:32,050
saying I'll be ruined in the
hands of the same woman I cheated.

1720
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,200
- What happened?
- But she said God and all.

1721
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:39,350
80% of the Gods are men and 50% from
those are like me with two wives.

1722
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:43,240
Added we are in foreign and
what will Indian Gods do?

1723
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:47,270
Don't think God can't do
anything if we are in foreign.

1724
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:48,770
He may come in any form.

1725
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:51,480
He may punish you coming as me.

1726
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:52,420
Correct sir

1727
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:53,200
Thank you.

1728
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:54,360
Give me that offering.

1729
01:24:54,610 --> 01:24:56,320
[chants]

1730
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:01,546
What is this sir,
why are you offering coffee to God sir?

1731
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:02,070
Hello,

1732
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:05,476
we humans drink so many coffees get a head
ache after meeting just a few members.

1733
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,750
He's God and how much
head ache should he get...

1734
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:11,310
when 700 crores people ask for so much
and how many coffees should he drink?

1735
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:13,490
Has anyone offered him at
least one cup of coffee?

1736
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:14,610
I gave.

1737
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:16,086
What's God drinking coffee, sir?

1738
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:18,650
Why,
is he eating what all you offer him daily?

1739
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:21,420
If he eats all that,
he'd even be drinking the coffee I offer.

1740
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:24,190
I offer even soups and cool
drinks as per the weather.

1741
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:25,740
I've my own beliefs...

1742
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:28,546
You aren't any ordinary person Sir.
To interview you is really our...

1743
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:30,900
Hello, this interview is
just a trailer that's it.

1744
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:33,860
Bio-picks would be done
about me and my life.

1745
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:35,110
Hail the Lord

1746
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:36,440
Coffee for my God.

1747
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:38,320
I will drink... give me my suit.

1748
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,480
- Come on, let me introduce to the family.
- Okay sir.

1749
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:43,320
The women who is nail
polishing there is my wife.

1750
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:46,150
Beside her who is feeding
her is my sister-in-law.

1751
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:49,316
They are so affectionate
even being co-sisters means,

1752
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:50,500
it isn't any normal fact sir.

1753
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:54,340
They aren't just co-sisters,
but own sisters and you underline that.

1754
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:55,990
Good morning brother.
[phone rings]

1755
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,080
Coffee...

1756
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,470
He's my brother.
[phone rings]

1757
01:25:58,810 --> 01:25:59,810
Hello...

1758
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:02,350
Three of our guys are squeezed
down falling under the Lorry.

1759
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,139
What is he saying...?
About lorry accident.

1760
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:05,320
Not that brother...

1761
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:09,940
As the Lorry tire was so big, three bent
and saw what's underneath and are gone.

1762
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:13,600
- Oh, that's it? Why does he say so, then?
- He's like that, you go and be seated.

1763
01:26:13,650 --> 01:26:14,130
Take him away.

1764
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:15,570
My brother.

1765
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:18,440
Why did you say such a
dreaded thing so smoothly sir?

1766
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:21,740
My brother needs to be said
shocking news a bit soft.

1767
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,160
There's a hole in his heart.

1768
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:24,190
Oh no, a hole...

1769
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:29,750
It isn't something as big as a manhole,
Just small like that made by a needle

1770
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:31,050
Oh, that's it?

1771
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:32,620
Coffee sir.

1772
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,140
Keep it there and die, idiot.

1773
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:36,780
I kept it and am dying now sir.

1774
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:37,810
Hey...

1775
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:38,900
Hey... you Idiot.

1776
01:26:39,850 --> 01:26:40,850
Hey, stop...

1777
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:45,060
Hey, stop...
[glass breaks]

1778
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,590
Hey, crazy fellow.

1779
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:49,900
Is he out?

1780
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:50,780
This fellow...

1781
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:52,100
Hey, get up and sit.

1782
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:54,970
Forgive me sir, I couldn't
die. Shall I die again?

1783
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:55,690
If I give you one....

1784
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:57,270
Why did he jump like that sir?

1785
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:00,720
They have been working with me
from the age of their grandfathers.

1786
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:03,440
It seems it's their tradition
to do whatever the boss says.

1787
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:03,940
Yes...

1788
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:05,840
Hey, get up slowly and go.

1789
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:09,260
Hey, go fast.

1790
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:12,250
Your family is so different sir

1791
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:13,596
Without seeing my heirs still?

1792
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:15,340
- Good morning daddy.
- Good morning father.

1793
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,889
This habit hasn't gone
even after coming abroad

1794
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:23,890
Damn...

1795
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,620
They aren't coming for that.

1796
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:32,860
Sorry sir...

1797
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:35,970
Hey, why on him?

1798
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:37,846
Won't they sprinkle if
from the God, daddy?

1799
01:27:37,870 --> 01:27:38,870
You're our God, dad.

1800
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,420
Is it craze or love?

1801
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,840
Crazy love! And this is my family.

1802
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:45,830
Face the camera.
[camera captures]

1803
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:51,210
- American?
- No.

1804
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:53,030
Russian?

1805
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,860
- Italian?
- Yeah.

1806
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:59,610
Oh! I love Italian girls.

1807
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:03,440
- Hey! Who are you?
- Who are you?

1808
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:05,380
- Husband?
- Hey you!

1809
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:07,740
Foreign ice cream would be great.

1810
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:08,430
- Oh, you people are here?
- Hey! What happened?

1811
01:28:08,590 --> 01:28:09,080
What happened?

1812
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:11,806
- I kissed a guy's wife there.
- What kissing wife when husband is there?

1813
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:13,960
Are you gone mad?
He had turned to the other side.

1814
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,730
- You...
- Oh no, that guy is coming.

1815
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:16,930
- Oh God.
- Come on, run.

1816
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:18,270
- Stop there!
- He's coming, run.

1817
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:21,490
Should he get so angry by
kissing his wife? Come on run.

1818
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,360
All these are normal in foreign, right?

1819
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:32,640
What's this bro,
all are moving around in 1960 getups?

1820
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:37,970
I'm Mr. Dora swami Naidu's sister

1821
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:40,840
I came here for some project
work. I'll leave after Marriage.

1822
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:42,430
- Hello!
- Yeah!

1823
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:46,180
You're like a healthy Telugu pickle.

1824
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,570
- What? I'm married.
- I'm married twice.

1825
01:28:56,670 --> 01:29:01,230
Brother, what's this setup and
getup? Is it any theme party?

1826
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:03,756
Many parties as such can be
celebrated having loads of money.

1827
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:04,810
Welcome everyone...

1828
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:06,570
Thank you... Thank you for coming.

1829
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:08,940
Few fool coming here for new...

1830
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:13,260
Think I'm doing such concept
parties as I have loads of money.

1831
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,780
- Has he heard?
- I too feel the same.

1832
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,610
Gundamma Katha is a film for you...

1833
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,280
And life for us.

1834
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:21,570
Oh! Is it?

1835
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:25,180
Seeing Savitri and
Jamuna's affection in this film,

1836
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:30,410
my father got us
brothers married to sisters.

1837
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:31,200
- Oh!
- Oh...

1838
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:35,290
They've taken care of us from 25 years
not to get into any fights in between us.

1839
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:36,450
- Good, good.
- That's good.

1840
01:29:36,650 --> 01:29:40,370
And so, with the same inspiration
for the happiness of both my sons,

1841
01:29:40,570 --> 01:29:42,480
I'm thinking to get
them married to sisters.

1842
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:44,850
Hey, is it fine for you right?

1843
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,070
Hey, bring two dogs from out house.

1844
01:29:47,470 --> 01:29:47,980
Why dogs son?

1845
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:49,406
Shall we tie the knot to them, daddy?

1846
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:51,170
Did we ever go away from your word, dad?

1847
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:54,570
Okay, you got your sons married so even
last year holding a party as such, right?

1848
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,406
- Hey, who is that idiot?
- Hey who is that?

1849
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:57,520
Hey, stop...

1850
01:29:57,820 --> 01:29:58,820
You are right, gentleman.

1851
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:02,000
Last time I announced to
get them married to sisters.

1852
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:03,790
But once the elder one got married,

1853
01:30:04,210 --> 01:30:06,210
sister escaped saying not
to marry the younger one.

1854
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:10,140
So, as per agreement we
sent back the elder sister.

1855
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:12,010
So, what did you understand from this?

1856
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:13,800
We understood that yours is a mad family.

1857
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,000
Not mad people.

1858
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:17,316
- Brother... has he heard again or what?
- That's what.

1859
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:21,250
But the clever people understanding the
facts of life stated by Gundamma Katha.

1860
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:22,540
Claps.
[applaud]

1861
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:23,640
Okay, okay.

1862
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:26,490
Now I'll introduce
daughters-in-law without any delay.

1863
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:28,810
Let's welcome the two
beautiful princesses.

1864
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,050
He's SVR and those coming
in are Jamuna and Savitri!

1865
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:34,956
- I'm getting to laughing brother.
- We'll see there funny faces brother.

1866
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:35,980
We will see brother.

1867
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:41,690
Cobra...

1868
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:43,160
- What dear?
- Look there.

1869
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:47,820
Oh no, oh god!

1870
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,626
- Whole family is come down brother.
- I am getting frustration...

1871
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:11,190
My elder daughter-in-law to be, Harika...

1872
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:13,970
A rascal has cheated with this girl...

1873
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:16,376
- Without feeling pity...
- Hold on Cobra...

1874
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,110
Married her and left within six months.

1875
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:20,460
Younger girl Honey...

1876
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:22,180
See how cute is she.

1877
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:25,080
A dirty guy with this girl...

1878
01:31:25,770 --> 01:31:27,610
He was six feet it seems, but no use.

1879
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:29,026
He should have a brain right?

1880
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:32,300
This six feet dirty rascal
got influenced by that cheater

1881
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,130
and listening to another waste fellow...

1882
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,610
He has run away from the
marriage hall, it seems.

1883
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:41,710
- Brother, he's pointing at us.
- Better for us to change the place.

1884
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:44,890
So what, great
daughter-in-laws are coming to my house.

1885
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,526
It's all because of
these unlucky fellows right?

1886
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:48,466
What's he brother,
pointing at us wherever we go?

1887
01:31:48,490 --> 01:31:49,726
Girls of our house and
daughter-in-laws of his house?

1888
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:50,500
- Yes, we shall question.
- Yes, we will.

1889
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:52,420
Yes, will we stay quiet if you question?

1890
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:55,720
It seems they are moving around here
in Europe. I have a licensed gun.

1891
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,060
Take it out and shoot...

1892
01:31:57,130 --> 01:31:59,630
- Oh no... Brother...
- Oh no big brother shooting means...

1893
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,940
Shoot means the kids during Diwali.

1894
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:04,150
Oh, it's just that?

1895
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:05,240
Let's come to the point.

1896
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:08,530
Engagement in a week days
and marriage in ten days.

1897
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:10,880
Let's enjoy the party.

1898
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:12,560
[cheering]
Yes!

1899
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:17,690
Hello... Hello... Hello...

1900
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:18,530
What?

1901
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:20,400
Darling, buffet is ready. Come on...

1902
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:21,150
Yeah.

1903
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:24,350
He's like a buffalo and a buffet for him?
Who is that fellow?

1904
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:25,350
My husband!

1905
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:26,450
Damn!

1906
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:29,850
That fellow for you? Shall we kill him?

1907
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:31,660
Shall we kill your husband for fun?

1908
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,256
- Half saree is so good, right?
- You're actually Jamuna, right?

1909
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:36,370
What? Leave me!

1910
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,320
Why are you here?

1911
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:41,780
Harika, what's this engagement and
marriage? We don't understand anything.

1912
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:43,270
Come on, we shall sit and
solve when there's an issue.

1913
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:44,070
Instead you marry like this?

1914
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:46,490
Look,
past is past. Let's be happy like before.

1915
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:48,640
Oh no! Why couldn't you say this earlier?

1916
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:50,650
What answer do I give now to uncle?

1917
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:54,360
Sister please, Varun is
changed. See his face, sister.

1918
01:32:54,650 --> 01:32:57,360
I want Varun, please sister please

1919
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:00,180
Okay! I'll talk something with uncle.

1920
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,160
- Wow Harika.
- Venky!

1921
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:03,040
- Gods must be crazy man.
- Thank God.

1922
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:13,270
You believed?

1923
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:15,740
- You too believed, right?
- Hey!

1924
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:17,430
You know what my real visual is?

1925
01:33:18,030 --> 01:33:19,110
Keeping your ago aside,

1926
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:20,810
I thought you'll keep a sympathy face

1927
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:24,770
and say you'd listen as I say
and be at your feet for lifelong

1928
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:28,470
by banging over your
chest and weeping tears.

1929
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:30,920
But, my visual didn't match at all.

1930
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:33,670
Sister,
even my visual didn't match at all.

1931
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:36,420
I thought this fellow would come and say,

1932
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:38,100
madam I'll bow at your feet,

1933
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,580
- Lifelong like a dog.
- Dog?

1934
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:42,030
But no.

1935
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:43,940
What, a revenge?

1936
01:33:44,370 --> 01:33:46,330
You leave us once you find someone richer?

1937
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:47,760
We left you?

1938
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,570
Who left whom?

1939
01:33:50,570 --> 01:33:54,840
You left wife and he
left her in the marriage.

1940
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:59,060
You know what happened after you left us?

1941
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:02,160
We made so many calls
and put many messages,

1942
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:03,940
there wasn't any response from you.

1943
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:08,240
We didn't know on whom we shall
show the anger, depression and stress.

1944
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:11,500
They won't be calm if we show that
on colleagues and managers, right?

1945
01:34:11,570 --> 01:34:13,880
Even the job I feel as
self respect is gone.

1946
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:20,360
My sister doesn't have the courage I have.

1947
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:23,110
Poor girl, attempted suicide.

1948
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:24,820
What are these crazy things dear?

1949
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:26,250
Why don't you tell me?

1950
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,400
Do one thing, come down to Europe with us.

1951
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:31,570
There'd be a change there.

1952
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:34,240
Dora Swami uncle is the
childhood friend of my dad.

1953
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,390
He came to India after so many years

1954
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,300
and said to get us
married to his sons if we like.

1955
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,850
We said him no and came to you
knowing that you were in Europe.

1956
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:44,740
But what have you done?

1957
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,880
Deciding not to be with you in
life time for what you've done,

1958
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:49,090
we agreed for this marriage.

1959
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:50,786
Hey Honey dear,
how will you marry that fellow?

1960
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:53,170
Come on, Honey is the best. How
am I and how is that fellow?

1961
01:34:53,330 --> 01:34:55,810
However he maybe, but wouldn't
leave me in the marriage and go.

1962
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:59,420
Hey, we too shall see how
does this marriage go on.

1963
01:34:59,650 --> 01:35:00,990
- Oh no, Oh God!
- Oh no, Oh God!

1964
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:04,050
We too shall see how you
would stop this marriage.

1965
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:05,360
You've seen uncle, right?

1966
01:35:06,630 --> 01:35:07,936
We shall put down that uncle, his sons...

1967
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:08,790
- And stamp them down.
- What man?

1968
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,106
- We'll do and show what we can?
- What'll you do?

1969
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:11,396
[instinctive voices]
Ask him to come here for once.

1970
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:13,890
What's that discussion
with unknown persons, dear?

1971
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:16,550
Oh no, unknown persons?

1972
01:35:17,770 --> 01:35:19,810
The bad luck isn't left us
even when we came so far.

1973
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,180
Huh, they came like idiots here.

1974
01:35:21,370 --> 01:35:22,396
- Hey oldies!
- Frustration...

1975
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:23,660
They are doing too much dude...

1976
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:26,580
Oh no brother cool down... no bro.
Let's look into that matter later.

1977
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:27,220
All the best.

1978
01:35:27,490 --> 01:35:28,490
Honey is the best.

1979
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,000
I'll teach you a lesson.

1980
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:43,150
I feel pity seeing you guys.

1981
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:44,580
Give some idea to be in the house.

1982
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:48,180
- I'll say something if you don't feel bad.
- Say, what's that.

1983
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:51,590
She's his sister and I
tried flirting with her.

1984
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:53,796
She said would set something
for me to stay in this house.

1985
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,700
- Please set for even us to be here.
- Please...

1986
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,400
Who are you?

1987
01:35:58,360 --> 01:35:59,070
What's that idiot brother?

1988
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:01,466
We are into this situation because
of that idiot. Look at him now brother.

1989
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:03,610
Don't worry brother, God is there

1990
01:36:04,270 --> 01:36:07,430
We are into such a mess means what
about that idiot with two wives?

1991
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:09,780
- He should get punished.
- You're out... You will have it.

1992
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:13,920
What I liked in you is your courage.

1993
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:24,970
I plead you, please let me go.

1994
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:27,900
I'll run away to my place.

1995
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:30,320
Don't panic dear, what did you say?

1996
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,900
Shall we kill him?
Shall we kill your husband for fun?

1997
01:36:34,710 --> 01:36:37,930
- I just said in fun.
- I took it seriously.

1998
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:41,190
I'm thinking to get rid of
that idiot from long back.

1999
01:36:41,650 --> 01:36:42,810
You came correctly... Here...

2000
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:44,360
Take...

2001
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:47,060
- Not so many like this. Just one time.
- Oh no, it gets cut.

2002
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:47,630
Fasak.

2003
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,820
- Added, I have two wives madam.
- Hey darling...

2004
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:52,246
Why are you holding a
knife early in the morning?

2005
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:53,810
To cut an apple.

2006
01:36:54,190 --> 01:36:56,200
Thank God,
I thought for cutting my throat.

2007
01:36:57,130 --> 01:36:58,850
I cut a joke.
Come on, let's have breakfast.

2008
01:36:58,960 --> 01:36:59,970
To hell with your joke.

2009
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:01,790
- Come, come.
- Good morning dear.

2010
01:37:01,870 --> 01:37:03,096
- Good morning.
- Good morning uncle.

2011
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,230
- Sit down.
- We're here.

2012
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:04,930
Come, come...

2013
01:37:05,150 --> 01:37:06,790
What dear, is he your project partner?

2014
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:08,820
Don't go down, just kill it.

2015
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:15,100
Looks like the whole
family is on the same job.

2016
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:17,080
I'm going to give
surprise news to you all.

2017
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:20,230
To give a turn to my life...

2018
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:22,100
Two messengers have come.

2019
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,636
Younger brother, is it death messengers?

2020
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:24,860
Did I say death messengers?

2021
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:26,496
Brother, you don't write your own script.

2022
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:27,690
Please relax.

2023
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:28,770
Oh, that's it?

2024
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:32,640
From now, how you are treating me,
you should treat them as same.

2025
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:36,330
In one word, they are same as my sons.

2026
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:40,570
Let's welcome the most
important people in my life.

2027
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:13,070
Greetings...

2028
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:13,720
No way brother.

2029
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,480
- He'll agree brother.
- No way brother.

2030
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:17,716
- Come on, he'll agree.
- Is Doraswami any mad to agree?

2031
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:19,280
- They are saying you mad, sir.
- Hey! Who are you man?

2032
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:20,300
My Boss.

2033
01:38:21,490 --> 01:38:22,070
Who are you?

2034
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:23,440
We're upcoming writers.

2035
01:38:23,530 --> 01:38:24,550
- Chanti.
- Banti.

2036
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:25,980
What are you doing here?

2037
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:28,076
These days,
the biopic trend is running right sir?

2038
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:29,916
- Hollywood, Tollywood.
- To write that, we came here to Europe.

2039
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:31,170
What are you doing here?

2040
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:34,660
By mistake we came into your
party and heard to your biography sir.

2041
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:37,570
What a story sir, what an epic!
Making that into a cinema

2042
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:40,056
and given to the Telugu audiences,
so many generation will see the movie sir.

2043
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,670
- I'm saying he won't agree.
- And me saying he would agree.

2044
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:42,280
- It's okay sir.
- I will fight.

2045
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:43,300
I'll kill you.

2046
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:46,440
I'll kill you,
if you both don't write my biopic.

2047
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:48,160
- Hey!
- Brother he agreed to...

2048
01:38:48,230 --> 01:38:49,040
Chanti and Banti...

2049
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:50,456
- Hey, who is Chanti & Banti? He's calling.
- I am calling you only.

2050
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:51,470
Oh, it's us right sir. Sorry

2051
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:52,550
You be right in my house.

2052
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,070
Give me the luck to get
my biopic written by you.

2053
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:57,850
- Thank you Sir.
- Thank you so much.

2054
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:59,610
- Having the coffee I gave.
- To the coffee.

2055
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:01,660
I never expected that
God to bless me so fast.

2056
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:03,660
- Yes Sir, we too didn't know.
- God is great.

2057
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:08,250
My soul mates coming so to write
my biopic, Chanti and Banti.

2058
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:11,826
You'll be right here till
the marriage is over, right?

2059
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:13,170
- Yes, right.
- Yes, right.

2060
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:17,310
- Be careful and write down the pic.
- Be careful and write down the pic.

2061
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:19,030
We squeeze down great
on your roles, right?

2062
01:39:19,630 --> 01:39:21,050
For our trial to be successful,

2063
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:23,190
make your to be
daughters-in-laws write 'OM' sir.

2064
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:24,460
What a sentiment?

2065
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:25,970
- Come on, write dear.
- Yes!

2066
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,080
Yes.

2067
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:29,250
Write OM wishing for our success.

2068
01:39:29,690 --> 01:39:33,190
That hand writing... Great lines
and a beautiful daughter-in-law.

2069
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:37,246
Very good! Chanti and Banti,
please join us for the breakfast.

2070
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:37,770
Yes...

2071
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:39,270
- Sir...
- Hey!

2072
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:40,790
What's hot coffee in bear hands?

2073
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,256
You asked to bring coffee
with my hands, right?

2074
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:43,796
Coffee is gone cool,
shall I bring it again?

2075
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:44,840
- Go inside.
- Okay...

2076
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:47,890
- Sir, in general why do you get angry?
- What?

2077
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:48,926
- I mean, how?
- That is...

2078
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:51,530
Like saying I go any far and do
anything... Anger as such sir.

2079
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:54,560
That is... My mom likes music very much.

2080
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:58,690
So, when someone sings false music

2081
01:39:58,890 --> 01:40:01,810
and ruin the tunes I go mad in anger.

2082
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:03,260
No...

2083
01:40:03,410 --> 01:40:04,420
- Oh no!
- Is it?

2084
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:06,660
My reactions then would be very violent.

2085
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:11,466
Oh brother, crap... Crap brother,
how can I forget this brother...

2086
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:12,060
What happened brother?

2087
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:15,250
Morning, when I'd been for jogging,
this girl singing, very beautiful voice.

2088
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,680
- Mind blowing, mind blowing brother.
- Oh, that voice.

2089
01:40:17,690 --> 01:40:18,010
Yeah! This girl.

2090
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:19,646
I too heard in the morning while trimming.

2091
01:40:19,670 --> 01:40:20,956
- Her voice is like Lata Mangeshkar sir.
- This girls.

2092
01:40:20,980 --> 01:40:22,256
- You much listen to her voice.
- Lata Mangeshkar sir.

2093
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:23,280
Really...

2094
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,610
You didn't say that your
daughter was a singer?

2095
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:26,940
That is brother...

2096
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:28,850
- They might be mistaken.
- Madam...

2097
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:30,330
- Madam, I beg you.
- Please...

2098
01:40:30,570 --> 01:40:32,090
Please don't suppress a talent.

2099
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,156
I saw with these eyes and
heard with these ears.

2100
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:35,280
Let her sing just one song.

2101
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:37,020
- Wonders will take place.
- Wonders will take place.

2102
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:38,430
Why are they saying so great, dear?

2103
01:40:38,510 --> 01:40:40,560
Oh! After practicing for a day or two...

2104
01:40:40,770 --> 01:40:43,266
Come on, is she any bad singer to
practice? She's a Gana Gandharvi.

2105
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:44,060
Bro, what's that?

2106
01:40:44,290 --> 01:40:45,290
Gana Gandharvi.

2107
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:48,730
At any cost, you got to listen
to this Gana Gandharvi's voice.

2108
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:53,420
Gana gandharvi,
I have to listen to your voice.

2109
01:40:56,610 --> 01:40:58,840
Whole setup looks good,
but something is missing.

2110
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,040
What's that brother?

2111
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:01,270
Brother, this man.

2112
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:02,430
- Yes, you please come.
- Bring that chair here.

2113
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:04,059
- It's good that you sit in the front.
- Come on old man sit here.

2114
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:06,510
No..no...
why this heart patient in the front?

2115
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:09,579
Rocks melt down with music and won't
the hole get filled up in the heart?

2116
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:10,916
- It's music therapy ma'am.
- Yes, true.

2117
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:14,560
Yes, I heard music has
that power and you sit brother.

2118
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:15,640
It will be good for you.

2119
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:19,610
Hey, Brother...

2120
01:41:19,770 --> 01:41:21,340
Call for at least the Ambulance.

2121
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:23,740
He won't live till the
Ambulance arrives, right?

2122
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:25,270
Yes, right? Yes, right?

2123
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:27,100
Yes, right? Yes, right?

2124
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:28,420
Honey is the best.

2125
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:35,750
[classical vocal]

2126
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:47,840
"Give me Promise..."

2127
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:51,420
"Hey Lord Siva, don't think on it"

2128
01:41:51,690 --> 01:41:56,560
"With half moon in the hairs and
the poisonous snakes in the neck"

2129
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:58,840
"Ruling over Ganges with no stability"

2130
01:41:59,070 --> 01:42:03,490
"Why don't you throw a look
at me with no discrepancies?"

2131
01:42:03,630 --> 01:42:06,300
"I'll worship the Lord"

2132
01:42:06,650 --> 01:42:07,290
How?

2133
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,120
"Give me Promise..."

2134
01:42:12,410 --> 01:42:13,410
Come on, Kill him.

2135
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:14,886
- How, there isn't a knife right?
- Take it.

2136
01:42:14,910 --> 01:42:15,910
Oh no, a gun?

2137
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:24,870
Hey... sit down... there is even more.

2138
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:38,610
Yes, super right daddy?

2139
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:40,169
What's in the song sir?
See the dance and it'd be a blast

2140
01:42:40,170 --> 01:42:41,770
See, they're dancing right?

2141
01:42:50,490 --> 01:42:53,270
"The charm of marriage is on baby..."

2142
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:57,330
"The palanquin is arrived baby..."

2143
01:42:57,980 --> 01:43:01,030
"Come on dear, let's get ready fast"

2144
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:04,820
"There's great band, come on..."

2145
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:08,880
"Great tune is on, come on..."

2146
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,700
"The stage is calling, come on..."

2147
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:16,620
"It's time to be a couple, come on..."

2148
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:19,340
Thank you... thank you.

2149
01:43:19,410 --> 01:43:21,730
You made me know that my
daughter-in-law is a bank of arts.

2150
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:23,800
Add all these into my story...

2151
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
[]
Thank you.

2152
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:26,320
Enough of looking, come on move.

2153
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,320
Anyone learns art with passion.

2154
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:34,490
But she learnt it all in 30
days with revenge over you.

2155
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,520
In 30 days...
Do you have so much revenge on me?

2156
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:40,090
Actually, I thought to inform
uncle about who you are.

2157
01:43:40,570 --> 01:43:45,100
But, seeing this frustration on
your faces... we enjoying alot.

2158
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,720
- You know? Come with more ideas.
- Yes...

2159
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:49,770
- More fun... Come and entertain us.
- Yes.

2160
01:43:50,980 --> 01:43:51,750
- Come on.
- Evil eyes...

2161
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:53,570
Come on girls I'll
drive the bad sight away.

2162
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:00,766
What more have you got to do here?

2163
01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:01,950
Go to that corner and blow...

2164
01:44:05,550 --> 01:44:07,230
I'll pluck out the eyes of these oldies...

2165
01:44:07,630 --> 01:44:08,966
- Blow the heat.
- This is too much dude.

2166
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:10,830
My condition is further horrible.

2167
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:13,330
I'll go back to my place
if my passport is given.

2168
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:16,200
- Who are you sir?
- Who are you sir?

2169
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,490
Can they be so inhuman?

2170
01:44:18,810 --> 01:44:20,960
Isn't there anybody who
gives a twist to this story?

2171
01:44:34,350 --> 01:44:37,880
These two entered into Dorai Swami
Naidu for writing his autobiography.

2172
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:46,680
Just his soul would be left by the
time his autobiography is finished.

2173
01:44:46,770 --> 01:44:48,500
This is my Pinky promise.

2174
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:51,230
Put that saucer down dude,
beard is getting wet.

2175
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,650
I kept this for a feel.

2176
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:04,990
But, it's quiet uncomfortable.

2177
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:06,660
What's our plan of action now, dude?

2178
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,680
Our plan would be based on their action.

2179
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:16,260
What's the revenge over that Dorai
Swami Naidu and what's this den?

2180
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:18,560
I'm your friend, dude. Share it with me.

2181
01:45:18,830 --> 01:45:20,550
No! No! Never!

2182
01:45:20,850 --> 01:45:22,940
I'm John Stro King of the north...
North... North

2183
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:26,940
This is my revenge is mine,
just mine alone.

2184
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:29,320
Even my shadow shouldn't know about that.

2185
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:31,890
Even to my shadow...

2186
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:33,106
Lights off.
[switches clicked off]

2187
01:45:33,130 --> 01:45:34,386
Why did you put the lights off dude?

2188
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:36,290
You said even your shadow shouldn't know,
right?

2189
01:45:39,270 --> 01:45:41,586
We don't have much time, we should
any how cancel the engagement brother.

2190
01:45:41,610 --> 01:45:42,610
What?

2191
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:44,800
Bro,
I'm unable to see my girl with that idiot.

2192
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,860
Yesterday it went so when Junior planned.

2193
01:45:48,270 --> 01:45:50,620
Now, senior will plan, you know what?

2194
01:45:50,910 --> 01:45:51,910
What is that brother?

2195
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:52,810
Please have it.

2196
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:56,120
Harika, let's also go to Goa
once and in that beach like that...

2197
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:00,400
Venky...
[glass breaks]

2198
01:46:01,310 --> 01:46:04,230
I have clarity on how to be
at home and when outside.

2199
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:08,220
If you say beaches and bikini once again,
I'll give you divorce.

2200
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:10,850
When I being husband asked,
she said to give divorce.

2201
01:46:11,230 --> 01:46:13,610
And now, if I make these idiots
ask, marriage will be out.

2202
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:14,806
- Super brother.
- Come on...

2203
01:46:14,830 --> 01:46:15,710
You told it greatly.

2204
01:46:15,810 --> 01:46:17,396
- I get to laugh seeing brothers.
- Yes brother.

2205
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:18,600
Hey, who are brothers?

2206
01:46:19,030 --> 01:46:20,256
We're just two sons to my father.

2207
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:21,060
Why are you laughing?

2208
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:24,570
While writing your dad's
biopic, your roles in that...

2209
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:25,070
What?

2210
01:46:25,270 --> 01:46:26,010
- What?
- Very...

2211
01:46:26,010 --> 01:46:27,010
- Very?
- Say what?

2212
01:46:27,270 --> 01:46:28,960
A bit weak in ladies handling matter.

2213
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:32,590
I too feel the same brother.
If not, you are here and they are there.

2214
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:33,380
- They are your fiance, right?
- That's it, then.

2215
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:34,370
Won't they get into the pool with you?

2216
01:46:34,570 --> 01:46:36,210
So,
are we strong if they come into the pool?

2217
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:38,120
You mean,
they come as and when you call them?

2218
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:39,360
- Harika!
- Sister...

2219
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:40,590
- Hi...
- Hi...

2220
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:41,640
Ask man.

2221
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:44,810
If you don't mind,
can you join us for a swim?

2222
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:45,840
- Swimming?
- Yes.

2223
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:47,020
You mean bikini.

2224
01:46:47,630 --> 01:46:48,770
You asking directly?

2225
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,176
- She'd now go to Dora Swami and get fire.
- Yes brother.

2226
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,360
- Marriage is cancelled now.
- They will now kick them.

2227
01:47:00,850 --> 01:47:03,090
- That is the senior's idea man.
- You are super brother.

2228
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:11,540
Why that change in your face man,
you should be more happier.

2229
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:12,310
Brother...

2230
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:14,650
- What, what happened?
- Brother, look that side.

2231
01:47:15,570 --> 01:47:16,570
Oh no!

2232
01:47:20,710 --> 01:47:22,420
- Oh no... What is this?
- Brother...

2233
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,240
Bikini?

2234
01:47:45,850 --> 01:47:47,770
They've happily dressed
up and are reading books.

2235
01:47:48,430 --> 01:47:49,870
You said senior's plan and did this.

2236
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:52,730
I thought to see this
alone after marriage.

2237
01:47:53,330 --> 01:47:55,010
But, you've shown this to the whole world.

2238
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:00,610
[camera captures]

2239
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:05,840
Honey...

2240
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:08,160
Why are you smoking?

2241
01:48:08,870 --> 01:48:09,870
- Heat.
- Heat.

2242
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:15,550
Oh!
Is heat produced after seeing us so hot?

2243
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:17,180
- Hey!
- Don't touch.

2244
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:19,450
We know that all this is your plan.

2245
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:21,830
That's why we gave a retort like this.

2246
01:48:22,890 --> 01:48:26,900
Sister, their frustration levels
are going to peaks day by day.

2247
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:29,920
Frustration for them and fun for us...

2248
01:48:39,170 --> 01:48:43,130
What's this like you got fits when
the other ladies are taking bath?

2249
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:45,060
- No shame at all...
- Cool brother, cool.

2250
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:48,220
Instead of sipping
coconut sitting like buffalos,

2251
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:50,126
why don't you stop when ladies
are going in wearing bikinis?

2252
01:48:50,150 --> 01:48:52,430
It's foreign and what's
wrong in being bold?

2253
01:48:53,230 --> 01:48:55,700
If you talk more, we too will wear Bikini.

2254
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:56,960
- Oh no!
- Brother...

2255
01:49:07,350 --> 01:49:08,420
Harika...

2256
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:10,060
Where are you?

2257
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:21,266
- Oh no, brother this is too much?
- Sorry brother. I got tempted.

2258
01:49:21,290 --> 01:49:23,316
Is this the ladies magic or
the weakness of men, brother?

2259
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:25,076
Whatever but home food
is always the home food.

2260
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:27,140
You were lucky and enjoyed
home food for six months.

2261
01:49:27,170 --> 01:49:28,826
You snatched away the
food from my mouth too.

2262
01:49:28,850 --> 01:49:31,010
- No, I need it brother, I need it.
- Hey, you stop it.

2263
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:33,590
You know what's the best
communication with ladies?

2264
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:36,020
- Airtel, Nasa?
- Jio, Pio... No.

2265
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,370
Romance!

2266
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:40,960
If we fill the gap in between them and us,
they stick to us.

2267
01:49:41,910 --> 01:49:44,380
Come on,
let's have some fun with the girls.

2268
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,840
- Yes brother, let's go.
- Girls...

2269
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:51,690
His eyes wide open madam, how?

2270
01:49:52,130 --> 01:49:53,420
He sleeps opening his eyes.

2271
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:56,950
Here, the heart is here
and just one stab... Fasak!

2272
01:49:57,090 --> 01:50:01,140
When the blood spills so on the face...
Go on, stab him.

2273
01:50:01,190 --> 01:50:04,520
I feel more frightened
seeing you than that fellow.

2274
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:08,210
Okay, shall we take him on to the
terrace and push him down from there?

2275
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:12,100
I feel this is somewhat better.

2276
01:50:13,010 --> 01:50:13,850
Why did you make us
dress like ladies brother?

2277
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:15,916
It's midnight and we can
cover up if someone sees us.

2278
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:19,260
Yes, I will narrate my childhood
love story to that writers...

2279
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:20,460
[electricity crackles]

2280
01:50:24,130 --> 01:50:25,290
Hello, who are you both dear?

2281
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:27,550
- Your daughter-in-laws... Harika!
- Honey!

2282
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:28,950
Harika, Honey....

2283
01:50:29,390 --> 01:50:32,070
- Honey, how did you grow so tall?
- It's dark, right father-in-law?

2284
01:50:32,450 --> 01:50:33,560
[electricity crackles]

2285
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:34,890
Oh no, the light...

2286
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:38,510
Anybody would fear darkness,
why do you fear for light?

2287
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:40,590
- We fear darkness in the day.
- And light in dark.

2288
01:50:41,570 --> 01:50:42,590
[electricity crackles]

2289
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:44,060
- Thank god.. darkness.
- Thank god.

2290
01:50:44,270 --> 01:50:45,886
Damn,
your voice is also changed due to fear.

2291
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:46,400
- Go carefully.
- Okay father-in-law.

2292
01:50:46,550 --> 01:50:48,380
Sweet dreams... Have a nice night.

2293
01:50:48,670 --> 01:50:50,330
Why this is tripping so many times today.

2294
01:50:51,770 --> 01:50:52,900
Hey, wait.

2295
01:50:53,630 --> 01:50:54,950
Where are you going at this time?

2296
01:50:55,010 --> 01:51:00,080
Sir, she planned to cruelly push
him down from terrace and kill.

2297
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:02,656
What's that idiotic thing dear?
Will anybody die pushing from the terrace?

2298
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:04,600
There is a tank in
upstairs, push him from there.

2299
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:06,550
Joking in the midnight, go.

2300
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:08,570
Joke?

2301
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:10,820
Is it a joke when said
to be killing a man?

2302
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:12,530
Hey move, I'm excited. Come on, Fasak

2303
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:14,380
- To hell with your excitement.
- Come on.

2304
01:51:19,930 --> 01:51:25,290
Oh my Harika, this night among the stars,

2305
01:51:25,950 --> 01:51:27,150
beautiful than the Paradise...

2306
01:51:27,470 --> 01:51:29,070
Why are you struggling bro?

2307
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:32,010
I mean, even the Hindi dialogue
isn't framing in the excitement.

2308
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:34,360
Not the dialogue but just the action now.

2309
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:40,280
Harika... Oh no, sorry dear this is yours.

2310
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:43,500
It's a mistake and you go.

2311
01:51:43,950 --> 01:51:44,990
- You go that side.
- Okay.

2312
01:51:49,630 --> 01:51:51,150
Brother, maybe they'd hit if we touch.

2313
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:53,980
There'd be the sensitive
nerve for ladies at their neck.

2314
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:54,790
Jugla...

2315
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:56,610
- Jugla?
- Yes, Jugla...

2316
01:51:57,090 --> 01:52:00,380
When pressed for two seconds,
they go into trance and surrender to us.

2317
01:52:00,770 --> 01:52:01,870
- Yes.
- Let's do it now.

2318
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:05,120
- Jugla...
- Jugla...

2319
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:10,650
Brother, it's working.

2320
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,020
- Jugla...
- Should I press?

2321
01:52:21,590 --> 01:52:25,500
Jugla, press, trance and
surrender... Where brother?

2322
01:52:25,790 --> 01:52:27,460
- Some idea...
- What are you doing here?

2323
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:29,330
Honey... Harika...
[door knocks]

2324
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:30,536
- Please, don't.
- Don't tell them.

2325
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,200
- Okay, hide behind the curtain.
- Harika!

2326
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:33,580
- Come on let's hide.
- Honey!

2327
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:34,800
Dear, what happened?

2328
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:36,290
- Uncle!
- Uncle...

2329
01:52:36,490 --> 01:52:36,880
- Uncle.
- What happened?

2330
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:39,400
- What happened?
- What's wrong dear? I heard some screams.

2331
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:40,590
We too heard it uncle.

2332
01:52:40,630 --> 01:52:41,886
- Even you both heard that?
- It was a loud sound uncle.

2333
01:52:41,910 --> 01:52:43,536
- From where?
- Uncle, it came from there.

2334
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:45,680
Uncle, curtain is moving.

2335
01:52:46,410 --> 01:52:47,820
- Check it.
- Check it please.

2336
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:52,156
- Brother, they both cheated us.
- Who is that?

2337
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:53,180
Dad...

2338
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:54,860
Who's there?

2339
01:52:55,690 --> 01:52:56,690
Who's there rascals?

2340
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:09,460
- They'd have ruined lives of the girls.
- Yes, right?

2341
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:11,480
- Call the Police.
- Get them hang.

2342
01:53:11,550 --> 01:53:13,110
You decide something uncle.

2343
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:17,270
Hey, when I came to share
a great idea with you.

2344
01:53:18,090 --> 01:53:20,286
Why did you hide behind the
curtain in my daughter-in-law's room?

2345
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:22,746
I said sir, not behind the curtain
but we shall hide under the bed.

2346
01:53:22,770 --> 01:53:24,210
He didn't listen and always does so.

2347
01:53:24,890 --> 01:53:27,920
Sir, hiding under the bed legs
will be seen for his length.

2348
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:29,246
- We will get caught, right sir?
- I didn't remembered this.

2349
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:30,766
Why does he talk so sir, crazy fellow?

2350
01:53:30,790 --> 01:53:32,270
Yes it's correct that bed is small...

2351
01:53:33,050 --> 01:53:34,050
Don't confuse me.

2352
01:53:34,470 --> 01:53:37,430
Why were you behind the curtain
in my in-law's room at this time?

2353
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:39,660
- Tell...
- Come on tell.

2354
01:53:39,860 --> 01:53:40,540
Come on tell it.

2355
01:53:40,730 --> 01:53:41,750
Come on say guys.

2356
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:42,770
You tell.
- You tell bro

2357
01:53:42,810 --> 01:53:43,690
- You tell.
- You tell brother.

2358
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:44,750
- You tell.
- You tell brother.

2359
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,206
- You tell brother...
- You tell brother.

2360
01:53:46,230 --> 01:53:46,840
- You tell brother...
- You tell brother.

2361
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:47,550
Hey Chanti and Banti.

2362
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:48,796
- Hey Chanti and Banti, sir is calling.
- Who's that?

2363
01:53:48,820 --> 01:53:49,570
I'm calling you.

2364
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:50,380
Yes, it's us right?

2365
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:51,460
You aren't any kids, man.

2366
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:52,740
Writers.

2367
01:53:52,860 --> 01:53:54,040
Behave a bit matured.

2368
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:56,160
- Right?
- Perfect.

2369
01:53:56,490 --> 01:53:58,030
Brother... Brother...

2370
01:53:58,400 --> 01:53:59,986
Why did all these come into in-law's room?

2371
01:54:00,010 --> 01:54:02,590
Nothing brother!
They made them write 'OM' yesterday right?

2372
01:54:03,770 --> 01:54:05,746
It seems that's gone and came to
get that written again, that's all.

2373
01:54:05,770 --> 01:54:06,870
Oh... is it.

2374
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:09,400
Hey, tell me now.

2375
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,436
- We came to get 'OM' written sir.
- Yeah!

2376
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:12,790
Why did you come in the midnight?

2377
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,376
We are writers, right sir?
We get mood only at nights.

2378
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,636
Why ladies getup for that mood?

2379
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:17,166
That is... It isn't good for
men to go into ladies room sir.

2380
01:54:17,190 --> 01:54:19,560
Okay you came and why did
you hide behind that curtain?

2381
01:54:19,740 --> 01:54:20,650
We were waiting for
them to wake up from sleep.

2382
01:54:20,710 --> 01:54:21,726
Why not do that waiting outside?

2383
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:23,950
We won't know whether they
woke up in or not, right sir?

2384
01:54:24,610 --> 01:54:25,480
Ok, get that written

2385
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:26,040
Two minutes sir.

2386
01:54:26,230 --> 01:54:27,780
Hey... Where are you going?

2387
01:54:28,350 --> 01:54:28,830
- For the book.
- Book sir.

2388
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:30,216
- To get the book sir.
- To get the book sir.

2389
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:31,960
Didn't you get the book
to get 'OM' written?

2390
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:33,260
Come on sir,

2391
01:54:33,460 --> 01:54:36,300
we shall get the book only when they
say to write after waking up right?

2392
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:39,196
Will you answer in the same flow
if ask you 10 more questions?

2393
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:40,220
100 percent sir.

2394
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:42,760
- Even the Biopic should be the same.
- 200 percent sir.

2395
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:43,540
Go and write.

2396
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:44,680
- We're hurt sir.
- Why?

2397
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:46,856
It isn't correct to make such a big
mess when we came to get 'OM' written sir.

2398
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:47,946
- It's over, right?
- Is it right sir? No, no...

2399
01:54:47,970 --> 01:54:48,780
- What's this sir?
- Leave it man.

2400
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:50,360
We are creaters...
[indistinct voices]

2401
01:54:51,550 --> 01:54:54,310
If you will come in correct time
they too will co-operate with you.

2402
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:56,266
- Please listen and cooperate.
- Pacify them.

2403
01:54:56,290 --> 01:54:57,466
- Go and write.
- We shall leave sir.

2404
01:54:57,490 --> 01:54:58,596
- Come on brother...
- Everyone move.

2405
01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:00,300
They've come to get 'OM' written, go.

2406
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:01,800
Go.

2407
01:55:02,190 --> 01:55:04,520
No madam... No madam.

2408
01:55:04,930 --> 01:55:07,280
Listen to me for just this time please...

2409
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:10,050
We got to push after coming
so far. Fasak, come on.

2410
01:55:10,090 --> 01:55:11,570
- Oh God, no please.
- We got to push.

2411
01:55:11,970 --> 01:55:13,206
- Push.
- Oh no, he'll fall madam...

2412
01:55:13,230 --> 01:55:14,490
- Come on push.
- No please.

2413
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:15,690
Oh God!

2414
01:55:16,830 --> 01:55:18,356
Oh no, who committed suicide
at this time brother?

2415
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:20,650
Who might be that
brother? Pull him out brother.

2416
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:22,330
- Hey! Our friend.
- Oh he?

2417
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:26,220
Hey, what's committing
suicide at this time man?

2418
01:55:26,770 --> 01:55:28,570
Is that a matter to ask in smiles, idiot?

2419
01:55:29,540 --> 01:55:32,840
Have you ever listened as
and when I tried saying?

2420
01:55:36,270 --> 01:55:37,750
I said God is great, right bro?

2421
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,626
- He had it good now.
- This should happened to you.

2422
01:55:39,650 --> 01:55:42,850
I'll return back to India
if you give me my passport.

2423
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:43,540
- We won't give...
- We won't give...

2424
01:55:43,790 --> 01:55:46,196
You told that curse kept by the wives
won't work right? Now you enjoy.

2425
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:47,900
Hey,
you look very funny with these leaves.

2426
01:55:48,010 --> 01:55:50,980
Oh no, curses from wives are working.

2427
01:55:53,140 --> 01:55:54,340
[lens adjustment wheel creaks]

2428
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,470
They are trying very hard
to stop this marriage.

2429
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:03,770
But it isn't working out.

2430
01:56:05,590 --> 01:56:08,060
[rifle ticks empty]

2431
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:09,870
I think bullets are jammed.

2432
01:56:12,030 --> 01:56:13,030
I can feel it.

2433
01:56:13,930 --> 01:56:18,180
That marriage should stop and
that Dora Swamy Naidu must die.

2434
01:56:18,740 --> 01:56:22,350
And my revenge...
[gun shots]

2435
01:56:23,270 --> 01:56:24,560
Bullets got released, dude.

2436
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:27,320
I can feel it.

2437
01:56:28,370 --> 01:56:31,100
I'm your friend, dude.
Say what's your revenge at least now.

2438
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:33,310
No! I' John Stro, King of the North.

2439
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:37,290
No, I can't.
I won't say even to my shadow...

2440
01:56:37,420 --> 01:56:38,050
[switch clicked off]

2441
01:56:38,140 --> 01:56:40,700
Dirty shadow, let it listen but
don't switch off the lights dude.

2442
01:56:42,150 --> 01:56:42,960
This is good, right?

2443
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:44,160
Which is good?

2444
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:47,090
Why should we struggle,
uncle? Ask the creators.

2445
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:49,720
You're right.
Hey Chanti and Banti, select one.

2446
01:56:50,050 --> 01:56:51,690
Why Sir, you select something.

2447
01:56:51,790 --> 01:56:53,790
Won't you select if they
were for your own sisters?

2448
01:56:55,810 --> 01:56:56,810
You...

2449
01:56:57,910 --> 01:57:00,990
- Why sister for such a small matter, sir?
- That blue colour is better sir.

2450
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:04,000
Blue...
we both are selected the same card.

2451
01:57:04,290 --> 01:57:05,660
Superb. This is selected, take

2452
01:57:06,570 --> 01:57:09,360
Someone stated to see how
the marriage would go on.

2453
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:12,330
They said to see as they
can't do anything, sister.

2454
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:15,790
Frustration is reaching to peaks, Cobra.

2455
01:57:16,490 --> 01:57:19,130
- Last weapon, the master weapon.
- What's that?

2456
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:20,050
Let's directly,

2457
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:22,050
- Attack on Gundamma Katha concept.
- How bro?

2458
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:23,100
Look to your right.

2459
01:57:24,830 --> 01:57:28,240
Let's say false words and
ignite a fire amongst the sisters.

2460
01:57:29,110 --> 01:57:30,950
Brother,
you think they'd believe in our words?

2461
01:57:31,430 --> 01:57:34,130
Ladies would easily
believe in false complaints.

2462
01:57:34,140 --> 01:57:35,200
Yes.

2463
01:57:35,780 --> 01:57:36,920
- That dry leaf...
- Aunty!

2464
01:57:37,610 --> 01:57:39,290
Your sister is saying bad about you there.

2465
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:40,940
It seems the total
property belongs to them

2466
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:42,616
and you are just sitting
idle and eating that out.

2467
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:43,970
No way, my sister never says so.

2468
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,306
It seems your husband is for for nothing?

2469
01:57:45,330 --> 01:57:46,676
It seems,
he just sits idle and eat like hell.

2470
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:48,336
- Why'd my sister lie so?
- Really aunty, why would I lie?

2471
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:49,360
You cut the leafs here...

2472
01:57:51,970 --> 01:57:56,150
[grinder whizzing]

2473
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:59,100
This marriage shouldn't happen.

2474
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:06,656
As I did so much bonded labor treating
you as sister, you taught a good lesson.

2475
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:08,396
You ate as you had no source and
worked as you had no support.

2476
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:09,500
Why do you say me for that?

2477
01:58:09,530 --> 01:58:11,700
I can't backstab like you.

2478
01:58:11,910 --> 01:58:14,506
Brother in law, forget all this and
just give us our share in writing

2479
01:58:14,530 --> 01:58:15,530
and we'll leave to India.

2480
01:58:15,580 --> 01:58:16,910
Brother... what!
She is asking us to separate.

2481
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:17,920
You wait brother...

2482
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:20,820
What dear,
seeing your affection as sisters...

2483
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:22,310
What sisters still?

2484
01:58:22,430 --> 01:58:24,470
Listen to me and cancel this marriage.

2485
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:31,550
This is what you need, right man?

2486
01:58:33,090 --> 01:58:34,459
- Oh no... Sorry.
- Aunty, please.

2487
01:58:34,460 --> 01:58:38,280
These dirty people are trying to separate
our family by saying all fake complaints.

2488
01:58:40,490 --> 01:58:42,580
Why did you both come
and what are you doing?

2489
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:45,406
Yesterday, you went into the
girl's room at midnight wearing sarees

2490
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:46,430
And now this...

2491
01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:49,490
What guys, how far did the biopic reach?

2492
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,470
We wrote 'Sriram' under 'OM' sir.

2493
01:58:51,670 --> 01:58:53,456
We'll write Sairam in the
evening and start it, sir

2494
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:54,730
When would you write, the end?

2495
01:58:54,810 --> 01:58:56,770
The end...
We still didn't get any new idea and...

2496
01:58:57,180 --> 01:59:01,170
Hey, I mean about this family...
and are you trying to separate that?

2497
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:02,790
Why did you do so?
- Come on Tell.

2498
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:04,900
Tell...
- Tell...

2499
01:59:05,530 --> 01:59:06,530
Tell...
- Tell...

2500
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:07,920
Tell guys.
- Come on speak up

2501
01:59:08,180 --> 01:59:11,046
Six pack Salman Khan still bachelor. Who
is the responsibility in the Bollywood?

2502
01:59:11,070 --> 01:59:13,570
Bahubali collected 2000 Crores,
500 and 1000 rupees are banned,

2503
01:59:13,790 --> 01:59:15,310
Vijaya Malya gone... What is going on?

2504
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:17,030
What did he say?

2505
01:59:17,230 --> 01:59:18,716
A flower is a flower
and a stone is a stone...

2506
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:20,436
Flower won't be a stone and
a stone won't be a flower

2507
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:22,076
Flower should be a flower and
a stone should be a stone.

2508
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:23,700
Flower is a flower and stone is a stone.

2509
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:25,490
- Hey...
- Hey.

2510
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:27,580
Get the gun, guys.

2511
01:59:27,630 --> 01:59:28,890
Why gun for this, sir?

2512
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:31,110
Here is 2000 and you won.

2513
01:59:31,450 --> 01:59:33,086
Why do you trap me after getting caught?
I don't need this money.

2514
01:59:33,110 --> 01:59:35,270
- Hey, no... What bet did we have?
- What?

2515
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:37,539
You said this family never gets
separated by whatever is done.

2516
01:59:37,540 --> 01:59:38,770
- Did I say so?
- I said it will.

2517
01:59:38,790 --> 01:59:39,290
Yes, you said.

2518
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:42,460
- So, you won.
- Yes, I won and a party in the evening.

2519
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,380
Hey, I pray you guys.

2520
01:59:44,860 --> 01:59:48,110
Please don't put prestige of our family
at stake so cheap for 500 and 2000.

2521
01:59:48,530 --> 01:59:50,250
- Till this marriage is over...
- Brother...

2522
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:53,500
I'm frightened seeing all these brother.

2523
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:55,930
Shall we push that engagement a bit ahead?

2524
01:59:56,150 --> 01:59:56,670
Yes uncle.

2525
01:59:56,890 --> 01:59:57,970
Tomorrow is the engagement.

2526
02:00:06,050 --> 02:00:08,750
"Like make up was done and wiped out..."

2527
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:12,150
"And like WhatsApp DP is changed"

2528
02:00:13,820 --> 02:00:18,730
"How'd you let go me, hey Harika?"

2529
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:22,610
"If you don't stop the engagement..."

2530
02:00:23,090 --> 02:00:26,510
"Taking an oath on the full bottle"

2531
02:00:27,250 --> 02:00:32,820
"See, we shall put a tent
here and ruin the house"

2532
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:40,940
"Don't leave made in India
believing in a China piece"

2533
02:00:41,370 --> 02:00:44,850
"Don't break the marriage,
hasn't your mummy said?"

2534
02:00:45,250 --> 02:00:48,370
"Harika, have some patience"

2535
02:00:49,030 --> 02:00:52,200
"Harika, have some patience"

2536
02:00:52,980 --> 02:00:56,520
"Don't forget first love,
listen to me my dear..."

2537
02:00:56,910 --> 02:01:00,270
"You'll become the second
hand, stop that online Rummy"

2538
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:03,710
"Hey Honey, don't kill the love"

2539
02:01:04,610 --> 02:01:07,730
"Hey Honey, don't kill the love"

2540
02:01:08,470 --> 02:01:12,170
"When the celebration is
on, I can't take Venky Asan"

2541
02:01:12,490 --> 02:01:15,750
"How to control my frustration?"

2542
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:19,990
"Our tension is growing
and can't watch any more"

2543
02:01:20,220 --> 02:01:23,020
"We'll protest and the
junction would get jammed"

2544
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:27,470
"Hey dhan dhanadhan,"

2545
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:31,210
"I'll make you play Temple Run"

2546
02:01:31,530 --> 02:01:35,150
"We've full fun"

2547
02:01:35,470 --> 02:01:38,980
"And you have the frustration"

2548
02:02:10,430 --> 02:02:13,960
"They used to stop even Yama for
the sake of husband, those days"

2549
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:17,700
"Wives were coming either
to the forest or the fight"

2550
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:21,210
"Harika, come fast now"

2551
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:25,470
"You're the man pushing me
out saying me to go to hell"

2552
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:29,280
"How do I come back again when
you weep asking to come home now?"

2553
02:02:29,700 --> 02:02:33,070
"My dear, don't put a flower to me"

2554
02:02:33,510 --> 02:02:37,190
"All the marriages are
made in heaven in advance"

2555
02:02:37,380 --> 02:02:40,900
"How do you wipe out
the fate using an eraser?"

2556
02:02:41,530 --> 02:02:44,470
"Hey Honey, don't kill the love"

2557
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:48,700
"You went away kicking the
stools with your left leg"

2558
02:02:49,070 --> 02:02:52,670
"Why are you begging
catching my feet now in a corner?"

2559
02:02:53,050 --> 02:02:56,410
"Is so much arrogance for your fair skin?"

2560
02:02:56,860 --> 02:03:00,180
"Won't anyone else give us a girl now?"

2561
02:03:00,710 --> 02:03:04,490
"If you go high being head strong,"

2562
02:03:04,690 --> 02:03:08,410
"You can never be back to reality"

2563
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:11,870
"Hey Dhan dhanadhan,"

2564
02:03:12,340 --> 02:03:15,700
"I'll make you play Temple Run"

2565
02:03:16,330 --> 02:03:19,660
"We've full fun"

2566
02:03:19,930 --> 02:03:23,410
"And you have the frustration"

2567
02:03:47,270 --> 02:03:49,700
Huh, what's that idiot
controlling our ladies brother?

2568
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:51,996
Let's break bones of
everyone and bring them back.

2569
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:53,020
Yes Cobra!

2570
02:03:53,450 --> 02:03:55,300
My anger tonight...

2571
02:03:56,230 --> 02:03:57,480
His blood...

2572
02:03:58,330 --> 02:03:59,630
My fire...

2573
02:04:00,350 --> 02:04:03,900
- My bla bla bla...
- What's it bro, you're struggling?

2574
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:06,940
I mean bro that frustration dialogue
isn't coming out in that emotion.

2575
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:11,300
Frustration is more important than
creation for the emotion we're in now.

2576
02:04:11,740 --> 02:04:13,420
[whistle]
Attack.

2577
02:04:15,630 --> 02:04:17,310
Hey Dora Swamy Naidu, come out rascal!

2578
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,306
It should be finalized
today in between you and us.

2579
02:04:19,330 --> 02:04:20,970
[whistle]
Come idiot!

2580
02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:22,790
Dad, see them... Dad, look at those.

2581
02:04:25,050 --> 02:04:27,170
Dad, they are saying like that to you...

2582
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:29,440
Either go and beat them... or stand back.

2583
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:32,620
What now?

2584
02:04:32,820 --> 02:04:35,530
We're now going to give
you a dangerous twist.

2585
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:37,120
Your heart would shiver heavily.

2586
02:04:37,570 --> 02:04:38,240
Brother...

2587
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:41,280
Brother, nothing to shock...
They aren't any writers at all.

2588
02:04:42,570 --> 02:04:45,190
The guys who cheated and ran
away from my to be daughter-in-laws.

2589
02:04:46,270 --> 02:04:48,590
Maybe they are drunk and came
back to take them. That's it.

2590
02:04:50,270 --> 02:04:51,620
- Oh, that's all?
- Yes.

2591
02:04:51,820 --> 02:04:54,770
Damn... What kind of elder person you are?

2592
02:04:55,290 --> 02:05:01,280
They are drunk, came with a plan,
gave a bang and tried to give a shock,

2593
02:05:01,570 --> 02:05:04,710
Do you say so simple to a heart patient?

2594
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:07,190
Where is the impact? Where is the impact?

2595
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:10,870
Enough or need more?

2596
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:12,010
It's more than enough.

2597
02:05:12,270 --> 02:05:15,890
Looks like you're discussing some
family matter and why me here?

2598
02:05:16,910 --> 02:05:20,520
Mine is down,
you too come back after yours is down.

2599
02:05:21,110 --> 02:05:22,466
- Move rascal.
- Understood, right?

2600
02:05:22,490 --> 02:05:24,930
The girls said everything to
me in the night. What now?

2601
02:05:27,980 --> 02:05:29,420
Don't drag till it breaks, move.

2602
02:05:30,110 --> 02:05:31,230
Why should we come with you?

2603
02:05:31,660 --> 02:05:33,860
- We have love on you, right?
- Yes, there's great love.

2604
02:05:33,970 --> 02:05:34,970
Love!

2605
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:36,780
That day we came
crying at the beach to you.

2606
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:38,280
There wasn't love there.

2607
02:05:40,030 --> 02:05:42,790
After coming into the house you
challenged to stop the marriage.

2608
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:45,000
There wasn't a love even there.

2609
02:05:46,610 --> 02:05:49,650
Even today, you're into making a nuisance
after coming in a drunken position.

2610
02:05:50,450 --> 02:05:51,650
There wasn't a love even here.

2611
02:05:52,670 --> 02:05:55,390
We used to get angry and
frustrated seeing you till now,

2612
02:05:55,490 --> 02:05:56,900
but we feel hatred seeing you now.

2613
02:05:58,680 --> 02:06:03,160
For sure this isn't the way to
win the hearts of ladies Venky.

2614
02:06:05,450 --> 02:06:06,450
It's over

2615
02:06:08,820 --> 02:06:11,510
[siren]
[tires screeching]

2616
02:06:19,110 --> 02:06:20,630
- Hey Honey...
- Harika...

2617
02:06:21,430 --> 02:06:22,430
Honey dear...

2618
02:06:27,860 --> 02:06:28,860
- Hey Honey...
- Harika...

2619
02:06:43,190 --> 02:06:44,190
Okay.

2620
02:06:44,830 --> 02:06:46,050
Your interrogation is over.

2621
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:50,240
- Hey brother, it's completed it seems.
- We're happily shifting to another jail.

2622
02:06:50,470 --> 02:06:51,060
What's this sir?

2623
02:06:51,490 --> 02:06:52,560
Do you hang just for
drinking and making a mess?

2624
02:06:52,580 --> 02:06:53,050
What's this sir?

2625
02:06:53,210 --> 02:06:54,406
You should show sympathy
after listening to the story,

2626
02:06:54,430 --> 02:06:56,046
- But you look at us like terrorists?
- Oh no, my passport...

2627
02:06:56,070 --> 02:06:56,740
Hey, stay calm idiot.

2628
02:06:56,990 --> 02:06:58,460
Rules here are very strict.

2629
02:06:58,750 --> 02:06:59,390
Move on, move on

2630
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:00,920
- Sir... Sir... Sir.
- Sir, please...

2631
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:08,520
Why did you bring here, sir?

2632
02:07:09,450 --> 02:07:13,500
House is the jail for
married guy and wife is the jailor.

2633
02:07:14,030 --> 02:07:15,610
Welcome to the grand prison.

2634
02:07:15,860 --> 02:07:18,560
Raji, guests arrived. Is the lunch ready?

2635
02:07:18,850 --> 02:07:21,570
Will food be ready if you call 10
minutes back and ask to prepare?

2636
02:07:22,010 --> 02:07:25,440
I forgot engaging in talks with them, why
couldn't at least you call at lunch time?

2637
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:27,200
Should I get strained for your amnesia?

2638
02:07:27,330 --> 02:07:28,720
What, your voice is raising?

2639
02:07:28,970 --> 02:07:31,150
- So, what will you say?
- What more to say?

2640
02:07:32,430 --> 02:07:35,460
It's all my mistake, sorry dear.

2641
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:39,260
Okay, I'll make it ready in 10
minutes. Come and be seated.

2642
02:07:44,220 --> 02:07:47,380
Sorry, sorry...
Sorry guys for keeping you in waiting.

2643
02:07:48,450 --> 02:07:48,900
[chair creaks]

2644
02:07:48,980 --> 02:07:52,270
After listening to all your
stories, I understood one thing.

2645
02:07:53,100 --> 02:07:54,450
Total mistake was of your wife.

2646
02:07:57,810 --> 02:08:01,560
Not just your wives, but it's a
mistake from every wife in this world.

2647
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:07,640
Because, we have friends for happiness,
IPL for entertainment,

2648
02:08:07,860 --> 02:08:12,240
brothers to share, bar when we go sad,
colleagues for joking...

2649
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:14,310
We have so many options.

2650
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:16,620
But for them...

2651
02:08:17,030 --> 02:08:20,110
Either in pain, happiness, buying a
saree, listening to the chat of neighbour,

2652
02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:23,250
news or a nuisance, shock or a surprise...

2653
02:08:23,790 --> 02:08:25,840
They have only one option.

2654
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:28,200
Husband!

2655
02:08:30,150 --> 02:08:32,400
They're giving this first
priority to us, right?

2656
02:08:33,230 --> 02:08:35,030
That's the mistake they are doing.

2657
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:39,200
You did a great mistake by leaving them

2658
02:08:39,310 --> 02:08:43,250
and disturbing their life just
for the minute problems you had.

2659
02:08:43,820 --> 02:08:45,500
It's a grave mistake, you know?

2660
02:08:50,730 --> 02:08:54,850
When some nasty idiots call, you talk
saying hi bro, what's happening...

2661
02:08:54,990 --> 02:08:58,110
And talk for hours together to have
done this and that, here and there.

2662
02:08:58,890 --> 02:09:00,400
But when your wife calls you...

2663
02:09:01,770 --> 02:09:05,220
You hang the phone saying,
sorry, I'm busy and will call later.?

2664
02:09:06,330 --> 02:09:06,980
I wanted to say.

2665
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:09,630
You don't give them
time, not listening to them

2666
02:09:10,100 --> 02:09:11,830
and they should get frustration in real.

2667
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:14,580
I don't understand why the
hell you get frustrated.

2668
02:09:17,640 --> 02:09:20,300
Every guy getting married says
freedom is gone getting married

2669
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:21,950
and that bachelor life is the best.

2670
02:09:23,570 --> 02:09:25,770
And the same guy when it gets darker,

2671
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:29,580
wears a lungi, ties jasmines around
the hand and gets into the bed room.

2672
02:09:31,610 --> 02:09:32,330
I bet...

2673
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:35,430
There won't be any husband
and wife who never fight.

2674
02:09:36,100 --> 02:09:38,960
Because men are from Mars
and women are from Venus.

2675
02:09:39,230 --> 02:09:41,250
Their thoughts would never come along.

2676
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:47,400
Men think with logic and
the women think emotionally.

2677
02:09:47,900 --> 02:09:50,670
Suppose if you come an
hour late from office,

2678
02:09:51,090 --> 02:09:53,790
their emotion why you haven't
come an hour early for them.

2679
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:56,500
I was late having a work is your logic

2680
02:09:57,120 --> 02:10:00,240
This emotion and logic
never match with each other.

2681
02:10:00,860 --> 02:10:02,720
They fight over that for days together.

2682
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:05,990
No husband deals emotionally...

2683
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:10,450
saying to go out for two hours
in fun as he came an hour late.

2684
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:12,010
Do they?

2685
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:17,270
Our logic is it's enough to give
a tablet when they are in fever.

2686
02:10:17,670 --> 02:10:20,500
Their emotion is why not
sit beside with love.

2687
02:10:23,150 --> 02:10:26,800
As and when men come out from
logic and think emotionally,

2688
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:30,110
then there would be no
problems in a family.

2689
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:31,500
I'll vouch for that.

2690
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:33,900
It's very easy to handle women.

2691
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:38,080
One kiss on the forehead with
love while leaving for office,

2692
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:41,460
one phone call during lunch time in
the noon asking whether she had food...

2693
02:10:41,670 --> 02:10:44,431
One smile for the sari we wear and
a compliment for the food we serve.

2694
02:10:44,830 --> 02:10:47,140
It's enough that you
just spend an hour with us...

2695
02:10:47,380 --> 02:10:49,620
keeping everything aside
after you return from office.

2696
02:10:49,740 --> 02:10:51,670
We think there isn't any
great person than you.

2697
02:10:55,030 --> 02:10:59,650
It's enough to say a few words
loyally for any relationship to be strong.

2698
02:11:00,490 --> 02:11:02,970
I love you when we feel to
be happy because of them.

2699
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:06,030
And I'm sorry when they
feel hurt because of us.

2700
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,350
What your wife said is correct.

2701
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:15,630
This isn't the way to win ladies heart.

2702
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:18,970
You somehow stop the
marriage and try once with love.

2703
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:22,380
Though you look like a old scientist,
you've repaired our brains very well sir.

2704
02:11:22,860 --> 02:11:24,266
I'll put aside the ego of being a man

2705
02:11:24,290 --> 02:11:26,216
and try with the
responsibility of being the husband, sir.

2706
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:27,820
Okay, you're free from this jail.

2707
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:31,470
Yes, before having lunch...
What's that frustration Asan?

2708
02:11:31,700 --> 02:11:33,426
- What is that?
- Why do you need that Asan sir?

2709
02:11:33,450 --> 02:11:34,610
Don't I have a wife.

2710
02:11:34,710 --> 02:11:35,776
- Won't I get frustrated.
- You are doing so much...

2711
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:37,060
Okay, all you have to do is.

2712
02:11:38,610 --> 02:11:39,610
That's it sir...

2713
02:11:49,890 --> 02:11:51,900
You see I had mentioned
before in agreement.

2714
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:54,400
If there is no sister
marriage will be cancelled.

2715
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:57,910
Whatever you do... I ready to face
it, I'll never change my decesion.

2716
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:01,050
The North remembers...

2717
02:12:04,020 --> 02:12:05,940
The North remembers...

2718
02:12:06,810 --> 02:12:08,070
Winter is coming...

2719
02:12:09,930 --> 02:12:11,790
Listen, every guest is important.

2720
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:13,410
"Hello..."

2721
02:12:18,120 --> 02:12:20,090
"Small commercial break."

2722
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:32,290
"Put your left leg in the
centre and enter hey brother."

2723
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:41,600
"Wearing the silk lungi high and
buttoning the dazzling shirt."

2724
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:44,560
"With Jasmines round the wrist
and spraying Charminar scent."

2725
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:47,370
"We've come, we arrived..
We've come, we arrived."

2726
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:50,570
"We've come, we arrived..
We've come, we arrived."

2727
02:12:50,830 --> 02:12:53,810
"Opening the Soda bottle
and with arrack in hands."

2728
02:12:54,070 --> 02:12:57,040
"Praying to Gandi Maisamma and
catching Borabanda vehicle..."

2729
02:12:57,240 --> 02:12:59,880
"We've come,
we arrived We've come, we arrived"

2730
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:02,840
We've come,
we arrived We've come, we arrived

2731
02:13:03,170 --> 02:13:06,200
Both of us with band in hands
and singing a great song.

2732
02:13:06,390 --> 02:13:09,110
We shall catch hold of
the flown away birds.

2733
02:13:12,370 --> 02:13:15,040
This is an item song by us for the babes.

2734
02:13:18,360 --> 02:13:21,250
This is an item song by us for the babes.

2735
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:24,230
Dora Swamy Naidu,
the great with his crazy sentiment,

2736
02:13:24,430 --> 02:13:25,636
Has driven away elder sister
within three months of marriage...

2737
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:27,516
blaming that younger sister
hasn't agreed for the marriage.

2738
02:13:27,540 --> 02:13:31,180
Now, when that girl enters see
how bad would her frustration be.

2739
02:13:40,280 --> 02:13:43,240
Put your left leg in the
centre and enter my dear.

2740
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:11,170
I with a bindi on cheeks and with
sounding anklets in the leg...

2741
02:14:11,370 --> 02:14:14,170
To step out of the house
burning out so many hopes.

2742
02:14:14,350 --> 02:14:16,820
What've you done idiot, what've you done?

2743
02:14:17,350 --> 02:14:20,050
What've you done idiot, what've you done?

2744
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:23,390
Making rounds with Gundamma Katha
and cooking up stories yourself.

2745
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:26,470
Linking up sisters and having
the agreement in between.

2746
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:29,190
You did a mistake, you did a mistake.

2747
02:14:29,650 --> 02:14:32,240
You did a mistake, you did a mistake.

2748
02:14:32,770 --> 02:14:35,790
Stepping in between the
marriage and holding your neck.

2749
02:14:36,020 --> 02:14:38,460
We've come to teach you a lesson.

2750
02:14:41,770 --> 02:14:44,800
This is an item song by us for the babes.

2751
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:50,790
This is an item song by us for the babes.

2752
02:15:06,110 --> 02:15:08,090
Here's your agreement
and here's my sister.

2753
02:15:08,430 --> 02:15:09,596
Though I said to convince my sister,

2754
02:15:09,620 --> 02:15:11,860
you pushed me out from the
house without listening to me.

2755
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:14,960
My sister is convinced now for
the marriage. What do you say now?

2756
02:15:16,950 --> 02:15:18,780
The ladies...

2757
02:15:19,870 --> 02:15:21,520
Your life...

2758
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:23,570
Their curses...

2759
02:15:23,630 --> 02:15:24,080
What bro,

2760
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:26,806
isn't the dialogue framing in the
happiness that this marriage is cancelled?

2761
02:15:26,830 --> 02:15:30,440
Hey Dora Swamy, what do you know
the value of their tears and our pain?

2762
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:33,370
Do you know what a lady's value is?

2763
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:35,970
- Where the women...
- Hey, stop...

2764
02:15:36,100 --> 02:15:39,310
Enough that the story reaches a climax
and every guy starts taking classes.

2765
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:42,100
We'll take care of our
problem and you wait

2766
02:15:42,970 --> 02:15:46,790
Look,
few believe in horoscope and few in Vastu.

2767
02:15:47,210 --> 02:15:50,370
And I believe that family would be good
by getting married to sisters like this.

2768
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:51,450
Please forgive me.

2769
02:15:51,550 --> 02:15:53,040
Hey, is your meeting done?

2770
02:15:53,350 --> 02:15:55,916
Who are you rascal, you came to my
house and are calling me an idiot?

2771
02:15:55,940 --> 02:15:56,940
We're the kidnappers...

2772
02:15:57,210 --> 02:15:58,210
Boys...

2773
02:16:03,070 --> 02:16:04,070
Oh no! What is this?

2774
02:16:04,420 --> 02:16:05,130
Dad... Dad...

2775
02:16:05,330 --> 02:16:05,950
Brother... Harika!

2776
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:06,560
- Where's dad?
- Honey...

2777
02:16:06,590 --> 02:16:07,590
Where are they?

2778
02:16:07,620 --> 02:16:09,026
- Dad, Daddy...
- Where is my brother?

2779
02:16:09,050 --> 02:16:10,050
Daddy...

2780
02:16:19,630 --> 02:16:20,630
[tires screeching]

2781
02:16:22,420 --> 02:16:23,500
Boys, bring them.

2782
02:16:24,690 --> 02:16:25,690
Hey...

2783
02:16:26,180 --> 02:16:28,600
Hey, you're Anasuya's brother right?
Why did you kidnap us?

2784
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:31,636
You think I'll stay calm after you
push my sisters out of the house...

2785
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:34,421
and now comfortably carry on
with marriage of these with your sons?

2786
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:39,000
Hey, your sister has come, we realised
and are even going to do the marriage.

2787
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:40,330
What kidnap now dude?

2788
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,750
Then, why did you kidnap, Nutan idiot?

2789
02:16:43,140 --> 02:16:45,160
You said not to stop
kidnap at any cost right?

2790
02:16:45,290 --> 02:16:47,010
Why do you say the
terms and conditions now?

2791
02:16:48,050 --> 02:16:49,110
[cement crackling]

2792
02:16:52,020 --> 02:16:54,070
Hey, which dirty rascal,

2793
02:16:54,270 --> 02:16:55,796
- Has kidnapped my Harika?
- Who is that idiot kidnapped my girl?

2794
02:16:55,820 --> 02:16:56,950
- I did!
- You idiots...

2795
02:16:57,490 --> 02:16:58,280
I'm a Don.

2796
02:16:58,320 --> 02:16:59,400
You kidnap my girl, rascal?

2797
02:16:59,650 --> 02:17:00,956
- I have nothing to do.
- Thanks dear.

2798
02:17:00,980 --> 02:17:01,330
Sorry.

2799
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:02,620
Is this tension needed for me?

2800
02:17:03,530 --> 02:17:04,756
Where were you for so long, brother?

2801
02:17:04,780 --> 02:17:05,906
Are there anyone still left behind?

2802
02:17:05,930 --> 02:17:07,316
Ask even those drivers
and cleaners also to come.

2803
02:17:07,340 --> 02:17:09,060
We took great pain and stopped
the marriage. Come on, let's go.

2804
02:17:09,070 --> 02:17:09,730
Come on Honey, move.

2805
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,276
You think we'll come with you
as this marriage is stopped?

2806
02:17:12,300 --> 02:17:13,460
We would never come with you.

2807
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:14,500
Oh no, what's this twist?

2808
02:17:14,690 --> 02:17:16,490
Come on,
please listen to us for five minutes.

2809
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:17,280
We won't listen.

2810
02:17:17,330 --> 02:17:18,150
- Harika please.
- Okay guys bye.

2811
02:17:18,350 --> 02:17:19,150
- Hello Dora Swamy...
- Hey Dora Swamy...

2812
02:17:19,350 --> 02:17:20,350
Please help us man.

2813
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:22,480
Our problem is solved
and don't involve me.

2814
02:17:22,890 --> 02:17:26,400
Hey Goddesses!

2815
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:30,090
If you really exist, none
should go crossing this bridge.

2816
02:17:30,310 --> 02:17:31,790
The bridge should collapse!

2817
02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:34,070
[cement crackling]

2818
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:36,040
How can you ask this type of wish to God?

2819
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:37,640
What's this bro, why did you wish so?

2820
02:17:38,190 --> 02:17:39,190
Oh no...

2821
02:17:39,230 --> 02:17:40,230
Caution.

2822
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:42,720
Bridge is in weak condition.

2823
02:17:43,090 --> 02:17:44,630
Vehicles are prohibited?

2824
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:48,226
This should be placed at starting
of the bridge why this is here?

2825
02:17:48,250 --> 02:17:50,880
Hey idiot, didn't you get
anything other than this bridge?

2826
02:17:50,890 --> 02:17:53,556
Sir, I'm king of the North and this
is South bridge, How would I know?

2827
02:17:53,580 --> 02:17:55,060
[indistinct voices]
[cement crackling]

2828
02:17:58,610 --> 02:17:59,680
Harika... go back.

2829
02:18:02,190 --> 02:18:03,970
Harika, careful. Go...

2830
02:18:05,220 --> 02:18:06,220
Move...

2831
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:10,550
Harika... go back.

2832
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:17,470
Save me, save me please.

2833
02:18:19,990 --> 02:18:21,710
It's falling even on
this side bro. Run now.

2834
02:18:26,950 --> 02:18:27,950
Move back...

2835
02:18:28,150 --> 02:18:29,250
Come on... come on... back.

2836
02:18:30,030 --> 02:18:31,030
Run...

2837
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:31,770
Come on run.

2838
02:18:31,880 --> 02:18:33,640
Brother...
There is no bridge this side also.

2839
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:37,190
Brother.

2840
02:18:37,360 --> 02:18:38,360
Somebody help him.

2841
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:40,570
I can't anymore, my God

2842
02:18:41,590 --> 02:18:43,890
Bro, no way that we go
back and move forward only.

2843
02:18:45,980 --> 02:18:50,830
For this bridge to balance,
someone from us should go down.

2844
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:52,830
Looks like this guy is ready.

2845
02:18:53,570 --> 02:18:54,850
Hey... No!

2846
02:18:55,340 --> 02:18:56,340
No sir!

2847
02:18:56,530 --> 02:18:58,890
I'm not even in a position to
raise my hands and salute sir.

2848
02:18:59,190 --> 02:19:01,670
I'm John Stro sir, King of the North.

2849
02:19:02,020 --> 02:19:04,270
Just one needs to go down, right?
- Yes

2850
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:06,270
Robert...

2851
02:19:06,460 --> 02:19:08,250
I love you John Stro sir.

2852
02:19:08,750 --> 02:19:10,030
Robert I love you too.

2853
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:12,680
Don't worry, I'll adopt
your wife. Thank you.

2854
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:13,390
Okay sir?

2855
02:19:13,560 --> 02:19:15,140
Anyway we are dying... let's enjoy.

2856
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:18,276
- Mom, hold this rope.
- Mom, dad come on.

2857
02:19:18,300 --> 02:19:19,720
Come on, come on

2858
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:21,770
Oh, even now you need only your family?

2859
02:19:21,990 --> 02:19:23,716
- We're going to hijack the total bridge.
- Hey!

2860
02:19:23,740 --> 02:19:25,486
Not even a guy will go
from here to that side now.

2861
02:19:25,510 --> 02:19:27,830
You should listen to what we
say and accept us, that's all.

2862
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:30,550
- Oh no!
- If you don't accept even now...

2863
02:19:30,940 --> 02:19:32,686
- We'll collapse this bridge
- Yes, we'll collapse.

2864
02:19:32,710 --> 02:19:33,360
Well said.

2865
02:19:33,700 --> 02:19:36,410
Correct decision,
if gone we'll all go in a crowd.

2866
02:19:36,650 --> 02:19:38,810
There won't be any of these
killing and getting killed.

2867
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:41,356
You die however you wish to,
but we will never listen to what you say.

2868
02:19:41,380 --> 02:19:44,770
Bro... When all these come
down like that along with us

2869
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,160
- And when their souls fly high like that.
- Brother...

2870
02:19:47,380 --> 02:19:49,940
- I'm getting goose bumps brother...
- Yes brother goose bumps...

2871
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:51,400
Let's break the bridge.

Hey please stop this guys.

2874
02:19:59,700 --> 02:20:02,840
Hey idiots, I am at the edge and
you are dancing at this time stupids!

2875
02:20:06,340 --> 02:20:07,780
Hey guys stop it.

2876
02:20:09,970 --> 02:20:11,400
Please stop this bullshit!

2877
02:20:12,190 --> 02:20:14,030
Hey stop guys, stop and I'll talk to them.

2878
02:20:14,570 --> 02:20:17,860
Dear, mom and dad are here.
I, your uncle is also here.

2879
02:20:17,960 --> 02:20:19,400
Just listen to what they say.

2880
02:20:19,700 --> 02:20:20,300
Okay, Tell...

2881
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:22,566
- How is you look down so?
- You should know the emotion, right?

2882
02:20:22,590 --> 02:20:24,230
You should stare into eyes in 90 degrees.

2883
02:20:24,250 --> 02:20:27,640
Bridge is in 180 degrees and
is this 90 required now?

2884
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:28,680
What, isn't it possible?

2885
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:30,360
- Brother, start.
- Yes, start that's it.

I'll say bro
- You wait and I need to say bro.

2893
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:58,470
Come on, I'm saying to talk right?
- Someone from you, please talk man

They're talking right?

2895

- My Boss will talk only.

- Hey, you shut up and someone will talk

- Shut up!

are old people and heart patients here.

What did you learn, rascals?

2901
02:21:16,090 --> 02:21:18,810
If any sound now comes out from the
throat, I'll peel off your skins.

2902
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:20,440
Brother, you have a hole in the heart.

- Sit down...

02:21:37,420 --> 02:21:39,050
I thought to put wife in control.

2911
02:21:39,400 --> 02:21:42,140
Are you any machine to put in
control? You are half of me.

2912
02:21:43,630 --> 02:21:45,560
I feared about school as
a kid and stopped going.

anyone let go just for this?

02:21:52,020 --> 02:21:55,130
I felt its fun without you and
frustration with you, Harika.

2917
02:21:55,410 --> 02:21:58,090
But, I came to know that life is
complete only when those two exist.

2918
02:21:59,420 --> 02:22:00,980
We did a mistake coming away from home.

2919
02:22:01,080 --> 02:22:03,516
We did another mistake to win over
you without realizing that mistake.

2920
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:06,500
Not to win over you but now we
learnt that to win you is important.

bear your anger and love your likes.

We'll be like dogs lifelong at your feet.

For any relation to stand,

2924

it's enough to say two things
loyally placing the hands on heart.

- Varun!

every Tom, Dick and Harry...

about her husband before anybody.

- Stop.

Show this happiness
after crossing to that side.

be in unity in the right time.

then everyone had been went to that side.

but what about our frustration?

- Yeah!

relaxed and then get over him.

- It's wrong on a festival day brother.
- No... no.

2983

It's not right.

- We should spend time right here?
- Correct.

What happened?

2987
02:25:17,850 --> 02:25:19,900
- No, nothing, it's just.
- Come on say.

2988

It's Sankranthi and friends are calling
by saying there are cock fights and all.

2989

We said no

2990

stay with wife on the festival day.

that happy moments, it's so beautiful

- You go.
- Go and enjoy.

2994
02:25:32,110 --> 02:25:32,670
Are you sure?

2995
02:25:32,820 --> 02:25:35,046
You said we are important for
you and that's enough for us.

2996
02:25:35,070 --> 02:25:36,070
Honey dear, sure?

2997
02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:37,930
Sure, go.

2998
02:25:38,230 --> 02:25:39,230
- Bye...
- Bye.

2999

They have agreed right brother? Come on...

3000
02:25:42,570 --> 02:25:43,966
- You solved the problem very easily.
- Hello bro...

3001
02:25:43,990 --> 02:25:45,036
- The place is famous for hen fights.
- Ah!

3002
02:25:45,060 --> 02:25:47,760
You know where am I?
What is this nuisance on the festival day?

3003
02:25:48,020 --> 02:25:49,250
Should I get tamarind?

3004
02:25:49,410 --> 02:25:50,876
I came for the chit amount collections.

3005
02:25:50,900 --> 02:25:51,670
Tamarind now?

3006
02:25:51,870 --> 02:25:53,266
- Listen to me... Should I listen to you?
- What is his frustration brother?

3007
02:25:53,290 --> 02:25:53,770
Ok, say

3008
02:25:53,950 --> 02:25:56,110
You talk, come on talk
- Hello, what's the problem man?

3009
02:25:56,140 --> 02:25:58,580
Wife sir... You'll know about
frustration if you had the wife.

3010
02:25:58,660 --> 02:26:00,220
- Frustration...
- Frustration of wives?

3011
02:26:00,310 --> 02:26:01,320
Oh, you're telling us?

3012
02:26:01,780 --> 02:26:04,930
Look man... There's a
technique about how to deal with wife.

3013
02:26:04,950 --> 02:26:06,390
- What is that, sir?
- I'll tell you.

3014
02:26:06,610 --> 02:26:11,440
From the morning to evening,
whatever they ask, say... Just one answer.

3015
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:13,170
- Yes, right?
- Yes, right?

3016

3017
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:16,440
You should move on shaking
your head saying so

3018
02:26:16,480 --> 02:26:19,550
And life will be very wonderful.
I'm saying right? This is true.

3019
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:22,100
Hello sisters, go,
