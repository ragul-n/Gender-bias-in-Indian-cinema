00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:24,770
Daddy

3
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,230
My Darling..

4
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,571
Daddy, all prizes are for me right?

5
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:32,731
I have asked the God, dear. All the prizes are yours

6
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:40,402
You are a cute kid for my eyes

7
00:01:40,732 --> 00:01:45,522
After how long you grow and when?

8
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,193
Daddy

9
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:53,573
Come..

10
00:01:55,113 --> 00:01:57,403
Hey Cutie...

11
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,574
Hey Cutie...

12
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:10,654
Your naughtiness and your words are diamonds

13
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:15,735
Your walk and dance are all wonders

14
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:17,905
Hey cutie...

15
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:22,946
Come with me running along with me

16
00:02:25,736 --> 00:02:30,406
I am your mom and I am your dad

17
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:35,577
I am like a toy for you to play

18
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:40,697
Like the earth to carry you
and with love as much as the sky

19
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:45,828
Shall I always come with you?

20
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,410
Birthday gift...

21
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,910
How much is that gift daddy?

22
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,030
Rs. 10, 000 Baby...

23
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,121
If you would have given that 10,000
to daughter of our maid,

24
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:18,531
she too would have studied like me right daddy?

25
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:31,742
I have asked God, dear. She is studying

26
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:41,953
How are you all, brother?

27
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:45,453
Hi uncle...

28
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:47,164
Hi uncle...

29
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:52,374
Daddy, why did they leave so?

30
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:53,704
One letter difference

31
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:57,455
We think as ours and they think as them

32
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,035
Come.

33
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:08,036
So..Beautiful...come.

34
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:10,996
Hello..

35
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:13,496
Arrange for the celebrations without anything less

36
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:30,788
Queen of Srisailam and Goddess of
studies is the wealthy Goddess

37
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:35,788
All in one form have blessed me as this great girl

38
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:40,839
When this precious princess
is moving in front of my eyes

39
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:46,129
I am seeing my life
within without blinking the eyes

40
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,669
Hey cutie...

41
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,500
Hey cutie...

42
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,210
Next year, when we come for this celebration
I will show you your life ambition

43
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,380
What is that daddy?

44
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,251
Surprise

45
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:16,502
I am your mom and I am your dad

46
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:21,672
I am like a toy for you to play

47
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:26,793
Like the earth to carry you
and with love as much as the sky

48
00:05:26,963 --> 00:05:31,593
Shall I always come with you?

49
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:34,924
Hey cutie...

50
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:41,134
Hey cutie...

51
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:51,005
Daddy, life is very happy.

52
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:55,546
I feel like living the whole life with the same happiness

53
00:05:55,846 --> 00:05:58,796
I have asked God, dear. We will be the same happy

54
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:17,798
Minister sir,

55
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:21,258
we brought the prisoners here against the rules,
who were to be taken to the court

56
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:22,348
How much more time shall we wait?

57
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:27,219
Look, I got them here putting my post in risk.

58
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:30,009
If you call your son fast,
we can send them to the court

59
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:34,889
Is there at least one idiotic son,
who listens to father even after getting 25 years, say?

60
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,470
When asked him to study in London
and settle abroad,

61
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,551
he said to settle in politics becoming
a goon and snatched all my power.

62
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:54,801
He loves his brother a lot and angry on his father.

63
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:56,721
He respects the servant.

64
00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:58,602
I did not understand

65
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:01,852
My son would come
and you will understand everything

66
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:16,053
Good morning brother
Good morning brother

67
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:19,474
Bless me daddy
May Goddess show mercy

68
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:28,014
Devaraju, it is time for the court.
Speak to them fast and send.

69
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:30,265
Why are you taking them to court, Minister Sir?

70
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:32,355
For doing murder attempt on your brother

71
00:07:32,475 --> 00:07:34,805
You wanted my brother, right? Come and kill

72
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:41,436
Why are these killings now Devaraju?

73
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:44,936
Remove those glasses first. It is very irritating

74
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:47,686
Aravind

75
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,060
My brother is my life.

76
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,811
Anybody who wants his life will not be alive.

77
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:37,441
What is this dreaded thing sir? Why did he kill so Sir?

78
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:39,111
What is me killing?

79
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:40,981
Daddy, what happened here now?

80
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:46,112
You asked those going to court to come home
and you killed them son

81
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,982
When an attack happened on you those days,
you left mom and came escaping.

82
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:51,062
Mom has died and you are failed as husband

83
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:57,113
Now, when I thought you growing old would be with me
giving advises like Kattappa, you are fail even now

84
00:08:58,443 --> 00:08:59,113
Bless me daddy

85
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:01,693
Servant Saraswathi madam
Yes sir

86
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:02,773
What happened here now?

87
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:06,944
When those rascals escaped from jail
and came to kill you and your brother,

88
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:09,614
you killed them for self protection and that is all.

89
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:13,694
Oh no!

90
00:09:14,024 --> 00:09:16,065
You do not have the common sense a servant has

91
00:09:16,985 --> 00:09:21,235
Hey Cp, record as said by Saraswathi madam
and close the case

92
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:25,525
Brother, see the faces of all once

93
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:34,366
Brother! According to science when
a wonder takes place before the eyes of human,

94
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:37,567
his brain goes into saturation state for ten seconds.

95
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:41,407
That means going into
a state of great surprise completely immersed

96
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:42,907
I am a wonder...

97
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:45,157
A great wonder.

98
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:51,488
Prakash! Not as a higher official
but saying you as a friend.

99
00:09:51,618 --> 00:09:53,738
The area you are going on transfer is in
the control of that Deva

100
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:56,908
We cannot do him anything.

101
00:09:57,158 --> 00:09:59,159
Do not get into unnecessary problems
with your sincerity.

102
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:02,069
His brother kidnapped four girls
and put them in house arrest.

103
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:05,659
Understand how powerful is he as the department
aware of everything has not done anything

104
00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:54,244
Lucky, what are you doing here?

105
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,574
I came to shop daddy

106
00:10:57,244 --> 00:10:58,414
Ok, you carefully go home

107
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:04,995
You bloody...

108
00:11:16,286 --> 00:11:17,666
Not that Prakash..listen to me.

109
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:18,786
Now that Deva..

110
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:20,166
No need of fearing to anybody

111
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:21,706
First you listen to me.

112
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,997
Prakash, please listen to me. Please...

113
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:25,417
Take Lucky from there and leave

114
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:40,708
Daddy, will you make brother alive?

115
00:11:42,498 --> 00:11:44,328
How can we make the dead alive, my son?

116
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,209
You are saying your own son is dead.
Do you have no shame?

117
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,959
He is dead what if he is my son, to hell with you

118
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:53,129
As long as brother was alive,
his wish was to see me as MLA

119
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:57,080
I will fulfill that and make brother alive in that goal

120
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:57,920
Bless me daddy

121
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,250
May Goddess show mercy

122
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:16,502
Where is my daughter?

123
00:12:16,832 --> 00:12:17,752
Where is my brother?

124
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:18,882
Where is my daughter?

125
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,382
Where is my brother?

126
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:21,752
Where is my daughter?

127
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:22,882
Where is my brother?

128
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:27,833
You are worried badly when your
daughter is not seen for just five minutes.

129
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,923
You took away my brother
for permanent and what about me then?

130
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:45,504
Lucky.

131
00:12:45,794 --> 00:12:46,334
Daddy

132
00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:51,085
Hey, I will show even to you how would the pain
losing those we like in front of our eyes feel.

133
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:54,335
I will not leave any of you alive,
who are the reason for death of my brother

134
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:57,465
I will first start with your daughter
and start with her death

135
00:12:57,675 --> 00:13:01,466
Save your daughter with the same
team spirit you killed my brother

136
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:02,336
Come on save

137
00:13:06,756 --> 00:13:07,546
Sir..

138
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,047
Hey Sundar...

139
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:14,387
Wow, what a team work

140
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:19,177
Sir, we should save lucky first. Come on sir, please

141
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:19,677
Please..

142
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:21,138
Move, move, move...

143
00:14:10,222 --> 00:14:13,302
You take Lucky and go sir. Sir, please go

144
00:14:13,513 --> 00:14:14,053
Come Lucky.

145
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:44,935
Daddy

146
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:47,016
Lucky, you go.

147
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:49,806
Lucky listen to me and you leave...

148
00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:53,556
They will not leave you Lucky, go

149
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:56,307
My darling, go as daddy said.

150
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:59,147
Lucky go... Lucky go...

151
00:14:59,267 --> 00:14:59,897
Go..

152
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,521
All along with you killing my brother died,
except your daughter.

153
00:15:42,311 --> 00:15:44,311
What is she, a small sparrow...

154
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,061
I will kill before she flies ...

155
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:57,482
I have asked God to send
a guy to save her wherever she is in this world

156
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:07,483
Even if that God comes in the way
to save your daughter, I will kill that God too

157
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,063
Confidence thrills...

158
00:16:10,524 --> 00:16:12,194
Overconfidence kills...

159
00:16:12,984 --> 00:16:14,444
Welcome to my world...

160
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:18,064
Brushing...
Shower with hot water.

161
00:16:18,484 --> 00:16:19,484
Having sandwich

162
00:16:20,524 --> 00:16:21,735
It's Yummy.

163
00:16:22,235 --> 00:16:24,105
What, are you fearing the darkness?

164
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:26,025
I am coming into your world.

165
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:53,108
What is the time?

166
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:54,948
I am blind

167
00:16:55,028 --> 00:16:55,858
But you put a watch

168
00:16:56,528 --> 00:16:57,568
I am a bit high in style

169
00:16:57,608 --> 00:16:58,318
Shut up...

170
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:02,108
Hey, I am named as Sahayam to help the opposite

171
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:04,699
Hey, can you not see?

172
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:06,819
Stop!

173
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:08,569
Are you blind?

174
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:09,199
Yes sir

175
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,359
Will you go walking by yourself
without the help of anybody?

176
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:12,949
That is, I am accustomed to this road sir. No problem

177
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:15,160
Come on, everyone is into overconfidence

178
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,740
If blind like you cross the road by yourself
how would we get the goodwill?

179
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,990
Still, what do you think of this road?
There would be stones, marbles, holes and ditches...

180
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,200
There would be a speed breaker ahead, see to that

181
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,911
I know... Oh no!

182
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:29,411
What did you understand by this incident?

183
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:33,111
A guy with sight should walk more
careful than the blind.

184
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:34,031
Good lesson

185
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:35,362
What is your name dear?

186
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:37,782
Raja the great
Apt title

187
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:41,282
This is the bus stand, where should you go?

188
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:42,202
Gachibowli

189
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:44,112
I too am going there. You get into 216

190
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:44,992
What about you then?

191
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:46,613
Milk tanker comes at this time, right?

192
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:52,993
Ok Google,

193
00:17:53,743 --> 00:17:57,204
now get to Gachibowli stadium

194
00:17:58,364 --> 00:17:59,994
Navigating to Gachibowli..

195
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:02,574
Your destination arrived

196
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:04,074
Thank you Google map

197
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,324
Hail Lord Ganapathi!

198
00:18:05,494 --> 00:18:07,955
My hairy dog should be good,
I should get great hairs

199
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:09,365
Where is my close friend?

200
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,165
Bumchik

201
00:18:10,365 --> 00:18:11,075
Hey Bujji

202
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:13,325
My Raja...

203
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:16,825
What is this? Stop it
My God Raja...

204
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,286
My mass maharaja...

205
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,666
Are you a human?
Do you worship a man with the flowers meant for God?

206
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:26,616
What bloody, will you adopt finding a six year
shabby kid at Odion theater in RTC cross roads?

207
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,166
Damn it, why will I adopt?

208
00:18:28,286 --> 00:18:32,207
Hey, I got this shabby guy of six years
when I was 10 years old.

209
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:35,207
If you adopting dogs and cats are humans,

210
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:38,077
what would my Raja adopting humans be,
if not a God?

211
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,788
You dirty bald headed....
Hey Bujji...

212
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:42,248
Why fight with them?
Has the Kabaddi match started inside?

213
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,248
No. Speech of the coach has started

214
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:48,458
Boys
Yes Sir

215
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:51,459
Speech of the coach is important to win a match.

216
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:52,869
What my speech now is...

217
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:53,869
Hey Coach...

218
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:56,669
Hey Bujji, is it a warm up?

219
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:58,039
Not warm up, all fell down

220
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,249
Is it? Hey Coach...

221
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:02,500
Hey coach... No, this is bald head Bhasker.

222
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,120
He is dumb mouth Prasad

223
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,620
Face with the holes and he is our coach...

224
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,750
Hey Bujji...
Here...

225
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,790
Hey coach, here is the recommendation letter of SP sir.

226
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,711
Make me play as the main player
at least in the main match

227
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:15,791
You could become extra player in this
Police team as your mother is a head Constable

228
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,291
You cannot become a main player,
how many ever letters you bring.

229
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:19,671
Go and carry the water bottles, go.

230
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:21,001
Boys...
Sir

231
00:19:21,371 --> 00:19:24,082
Speech of the coach is important to win a match.

232
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:25,872
What my speech now is...

233
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:27,712
Hey, umpire there is calling for the game.

234
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:30,752
Come on
Play well idiots...

235
00:19:30,872 --> 00:19:35,043
Welcome to the district level pro kabaddi tournament

236
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,334
Oh no.. My leg..
Not that side, we shall go this way

237
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:47,624
You bloody idiot, we with good sight
are standing here and why do you wander so?

238
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:48,254
Stand here.

239
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:50,584
Now, coming before us is...

240
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:51,714
Swamiji, bless me.

241
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:53,715
Hi..

242
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:57,215
Hello, I am the vice captain and cup too is ours

243
00:19:59,005 --> 00:19:59,415
Come on...

244
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:06,796
What is our game planning?

245
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:07,916
Jai Tahishmati!

246
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,966
This talisman has brought us to finals
and this will bring us the cup too now

247
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:15,917
Heads!
Court or the chant?

248
00:20:19,627 --> 00:20:20,297
Chant!

249
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:21,547
Good luck bro

250
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:24,007
I am..
Hey..wait.

251
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:25,127
I will go..

252
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:26,758
He is strong guy in our team.

253
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:30,128
Go, hit two to three and come.
You will always have my blessings, go.

254
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:36,089
Kabaddi, kabaddi...

255
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:37,669
Oh no...

256
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:44,629
He is not responding at all.
Is he alive or dead?

257
00:20:46,469 --> 00:20:48,420
Super!
What dude?

258
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,300
Will you not send me?

259
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,670
Kabaddi...
Oh no, what is he like Kalakeya?

260
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,380
Super...

261
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,470
What dude?

262
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,590
Send me, man

263
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,761
Kabaddi...

264
00:20:58,841 --> 00:20:59,921
Yes, point

265
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:03,471
Kabaddi...
Yes, point

266
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:06,381
Kabaddi...
Yes, point

267
00:21:06,421 --> 00:21:07,171
Oh no..

268
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:09,222
I stopped chant, get up.
I am going breathless guys.

269
00:21:09,342 --> 00:21:13,172
By the end of first half Bank bulls
are down in the hands of our Police Rodies

270
00:21:13,302 --> 00:21:15,632
Our score is 35
Ours is zero

271
00:21:15,802 --> 00:21:19,133
Waste fellows...

272
00:21:19,423 --> 00:21:21,093
See john, they are hitting your men with bottles.

273
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:23,053
Hey, all these are natural for our Indian sports

274
00:21:23,473 --> 00:21:26,013
These idiots look to take lives for points.

275
00:21:26,423 --> 00:21:28,343
See how they are dashing like wild pigs

276
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:29,554
What is the score?
35-0

277
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:30,634
A match to win
Yes

278
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:33,134
Hey coach, one chance. Just one chance

279
00:21:33,344 --> 00:21:35,554
What will he do giving a chance sir?
What will he do?

280
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:38,424
He keeps saying Kabaddi and move in his own court

281
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,975
Hey Bujji, what is the face expression of coach?

282
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:42,765
It is glowing in between victory and happiness

283
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:44,345
I did not like
So what?

284
00:21:44,385 --> 00:21:44,885
Hey..catch it.

285
00:21:44,975 --> 00:21:47,135
He is a coach and this is a team of his

286
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:48,805
Hey..move

287
00:21:50,516 --> 00:21:51,056
Bumchik...

288
00:21:52,636 --> 00:21:54,846
Hey, make me play in your team
and I will make you win

289
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:58,926
One chance dudes, just one chance and I will finish it

290
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:00,516
What can you do without eye sight?

291
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:02,097
What did you do with 14 eyes?

292
00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:04,807
Why is there no sound?

293
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:06,227
What a confidence?

294
00:22:06,517 --> 00:22:09,767
We can better believe in his power than this talisman

295
00:22:10,057 --> 00:22:12,728
New josh came as he
came unexpectedly into the team.

296
00:22:12,928 --> 00:22:15,978
When those with eyes could not do anything,
what would a blind do John?

297
00:22:16,018 --> 00:22:17,098
Robert.. See there

298
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:17,558
Okay.

299
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:21,228
Kabaddi...

300
00:22:21,268 --> 00:22:22,519
Yes, he is caught now

301
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:25,729
Yes, he is caught now
Hey, why do you pull my leg?

302
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:28,179
Hey...
Out..

303
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:32,229
What will they win the cup?

304
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:33,390
You pulled our own guy?

305
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,180
How did I miss so? Ok, let us count.

306
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,100
1, 2, 3, 4...
Mid line

307
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,310
1, 2, 3, 4...
Ball line

308
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,350
1, 2
Bonus line

309
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,560
1, 2, 3...
End line

310
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:43,430
Side line.

311
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:45,681
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
End line

312
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,021
5 here and 5 there and total 10.

313
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,391
Someone go for an empty ride.

314
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:49,601
Come on.. Go.

315
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:53,351
Bull, what bull? Black bull...

316
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:55,312
Yes, I had been and back..
Come now idiots, come

317
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:56,482
Come

318
00:22:58,482 --> 00:22:59,732
Kabaddi...

319
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,232
Kabaddi...

320
00:23:04,813 --> 00:23:05,483
Kabaddi...

321
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:07,023
Kabaddi...

322
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:08,683
Kabaddi...

323
00:23:09,393 --> 00:23:09,983
Kabaddi...

324
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:11,893
Kabaddi...

325
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:13,393
Kabaddi...

326
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:14,813
Kabaddi...

327
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,234
Kabaddi...

328
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:17,564
Kabaddi...

329
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:19,024
Kabaddi...

330
00:23:19,434 --> 00:23:20,234
Kabaddi...

331
00:23:20,894 --> 00:23:21,644
Kabaddi...

332
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:22,854
Kabaddi...

333
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:24,234
Kabaddi...

334
00:23:24,894 --> 00:23:26,315
Kabaddi...

335
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:27,435
Kabaddi...

336
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:28,275
Kabaddi...

337
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:30,275
Kabaddi...

338
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:35,025
Kabaddi...

339
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:46,566
Kabaddi...

340
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:48,357
Kabaddi...

341
00:23:48,437 --> 00:23:50,937
Kabaddi...

342
00:23:51,027 --> 00:23:53,857
Kabaddi...

343
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:11,689
What is he playing Bathukamma instead of Kabaddi?

344
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:12,439
Echo

345
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:13,069
That means?

346
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,959
Human gets a sound from near and
another from far.

347
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:17,239
He makes them out based on it.

348
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,150
Kabaddi...

349
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,240
Looking at the pace of our blind boy,
he would shake your team.

350
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,071
Kabaddi...

351
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:35,071
Kabaddi...

352
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:40,281
Kabaddi...

353
00:24:40,652 --> 00:24:43,112
Theirs is 35 and yours is 36 and correctly on the edge.

354
00:24:43,152 --> 00:24:44,692
You should get 2 points to win.

355
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:45,942
It is enough for us to stay on what we have.

356
00:24:46,032 --> 00:24:46,992
Our guy would get us to win.

357
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:48,652
How many are on that side?
Two are there

358
00:24:48,942 --> 00:24:50,242
I will go...I will go.

359
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:51,823
Will you go?
Go, come on go

360
00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:53,863
They win getting the two points only.

361
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,693
It is enough that you are not caught.

362
00:24:56,153 --> 00:24:58,613
He should listen to any sound.
You both remove your shoes.

363
00:25:15,825 --> 00:25:19,655
Kabaddi...

364
00:25:19,695 --> 00:25:24,576
Kabaddi...

365
00:25:24,786 --> 00:25:26,286
Are you frightened idiots, not coming in front?

366
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:27,076
Kabaddi...

367
00:25:27,786 --> 00:25:28,786
Come if you have guts,

368
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:30,786
Kabaddi...

369
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:31,946
Come on...Silence

370
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:34,907
What idiots, shall I arrange for saree
and jasmines for you to wear?

371
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:35,867
Kabaddi...

372
00:25:35,907 --> 00:25:37,907
Come front idiot...
Do not react

373
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,327
You did not get even one point after I came. Come on...

374
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:44,077
Kabaddi...

375
00:25:46,868 --> 00:25:47,658
Come on...

376
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:48,408
Come..

377
00:25:48,698 --> 00:25:49,198
Come.

378
00:25:53,948 --> 00:25:55,039
Kabaddi...

379
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:04,789
Cup is ours...

380
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,290
Won the cup

381
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,330
Audience are marching ahead

382
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,080
It is natural in Indian sports to pat first
and then march ahead.

383
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,160
Yes, it is true

384
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,161
What will you say now in the department?

385
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:18,871
What will they generally write in papers
when India loses?

386
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:19,451
What they write..

387
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,501
They won the cup and we won the hearts

388
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:25,411
Hey, bujji what is the expression
on face of that coach now?

389
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:25,951
I will say

390
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:28,122
It is struggling in between pain and loss.

391
00:26:28,372 --> 00:26:29,662
Yes, it is laughing time

392
00:26:52,504 --> 00:26:55,414
Raja, Raja, Raja the great

393
00:26:57,294 --> 00:27:00,255
Dazzling 2000 note

394
00:27:01,915 --> 00:27:04,835
Raja, Raja, Raja the great

395
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,085
Dazzling 2000 note

396
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:11,086
Raja, Raja, Raja the great

397
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:14,336
Fate changes when you step in

398
00:27:15,206 --> 00:27:18,006
Like this stick in black and white

399
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:21,167
You filled colour in our life

400
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:23,417
That you have no sight...

401
00:27:23,457 --> 00:27:26,167
Shut up, is that topic needed now?
Can you not sing without that?

402
00:27:26,257 --> 00:27:27,007
Sorry boss

403
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:29,507
Great sound from the drums

404
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:32,708
It will be a wow if I dance in steps

405
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:35,798
Great sound from the drums

406
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:39,298
There is great stuff with us

407
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,760
You are our trump card

408
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,011
You are our world cup

409
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:06,881
You are our trump card

410
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:08,511
You are our world cup

411
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:11,591
You are the ground and back ground

412
00:28:11,801 --> 00:28:14,512
Your whistle is my tonic

413
00:28:14,672 --> 00:28:18,052
Your shoulders carrying me are Titanic

414
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,423
When screaming so, I get kick.
Let us go ahead in the same swing.

415
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:29,053
His sight is tsunami...

416
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:30,303
Stop it, where is the sight?

417
00:28:30,513 --> 00:28:32,343
Do not praise of what is not there.
Just praise of what is there, ok?

418
00:28:32,513 --> 00:28:35,344
Great sound from the drums

419
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,384
It will be a wow if I dance in steps

420
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:41,804
Great sound from the drums

421
00:28:41,924 --> 00:28:45,425
There is great stuff with us

422
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:46,215
Come on..

423
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:47,715
Come.... Come on..

424
00:28:48,385 --> 00:28:49,215
Come.... Come on..

425
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:51,715
Come on..

426
00:28:51,765 --> 00:28:54,925
Raja, Raja, Raja the great

427
00:28:54,965 --> 00:28:58,096
Raja, Raja, Raja the great

428
00:29:10,677 --> 00:29:12,097
If he puts the hand...

429
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:14,467
Why doubts, I have both the hands... Continue

430
00:29:14,557 --> 00:29:18,138
If he puts hands, it is a luck and kick

431
00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:20,808
Great sound from the drums

432
00:29:21,348 --> 00:29:23,928
It will be a wow if I dance in steps

433
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:27,178
Great sound from the drums

434
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:30,429
There is great stuff with us

435
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,599
Great sound from the drums

436
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:36,849
It will be a wow if I dance in steps

437
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:40,020
Great sound from the drums

438
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,270
There is great stuff with us

439
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,850
Why is the door open?

440
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,930
Mom would have come then

441
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,060
Ananthalakshmi!

442
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,311
Ananthalakshmi

443
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:54,561
She is there, come

444
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:07,222
Ananthalakshmi, we defeated your
Police team badly and won the cup.

445
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,222
Hey Bujji, show it

446
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:10,063
Here is the cup.. Hi five...

447
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:12,603
Hi five...No!
She is slapping

448
00:30:12,683 --> 00:30:13,813
Why?
No idea

449
00:30:13,973 --> 00:30:15,603
Oh, she too is a Police right?

450
00:30:15,723 --> 00:30:18,143
I do not need cup
What do you need then?

451
00:30:19,143 --> 00:30:21,104
I wish to see you as a Police dear.

452
00:30:21,684 --> 00:30:24,024
They are not giving you that job on the name of rules.

453
00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:28,564
I wish to see you in a Police operation before I die, son.

454
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:30,814
Come on spit
No... here

455
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:33,105
Yes, give it here

456
00:30:34,355 --> 00:30:37,065
IG sir has started a secret operation newly.

457
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:39,025
You somehow join in that team and...

458
00:30:39,065 --> 00:30:41,025
The confidence you have is not there
to that higher official

459
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:43,976
This operation is in regard with the life of a girl, son

460
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:55,857
Later, IG sir called uncles of Lucky.

461
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,857
Everything is cut with her dad itself sir.
We have no issues even if she dies.

462
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:00,727
See you.

463
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:01,817
Come on move..

464
00:31:03,318 --> 00:31:04,108
What humans are these

465
00:31:04,978 --> 00:31:07,478
Lucky, we will arrange Police protection for you

466
00:31:07,978 --> 00:31:11,108
No uncle, not even another Police should die for me

467
00:31:11,478 --> 00:31:14,069
I have no hope on life without my father.

468
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:18,819
I will live till I die or till he kills

469
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:25,570
As she did not agree Police to be with her,
IG sir planned a secret operation to save her.

470
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,280
It is not just my wish that you go for this operation,
but your responsibility too

471
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,280
You met with an accident returning
from school in childhood

472
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,781
Doctors said huge amount
would be required for operation

473
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:39,321
There was no trial left behind by me for me

474
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:42,981
Prakash Sir was in charge as CI at our station then.

475
00:31:55,322 --> 00:31:55,862
Sir...

476
00:31:56,863 --> 00:31:57,943
Take good care of the boy

477
00:31:58,153 --> 00:32:01,283
You got the chance to pay back the debt of him,
who saved your life

478
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,153
Anantha Lakshmi

479
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:04,073
Raja

480
00:32:04,113 --> 00:32:07,074
It seems dry fruit paper sweet is come
fresh in the market

481
00:32:07,444 --> 00:32:09,734
Not a basket but, arrange a bigger plate this time

482
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:24,035
This land and the river...

483
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,575
Hey my favorite song is on, increase the sound

484
00:32:26,785 --> 00:32:31,326
My people who took care of me...

485
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:32,286
Yes sir...

486
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:32,906
switch of that TV

487
00:32:32,946 --> 00:32:34,036
Hey, switch of that TV

488
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:35,236
See madam..

489
00:32:35,696 --> 00:32:37,536
I am keeping calm as we are from same department.

490
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:39,537
How can a blind be in the department?

491
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,367
Handmade sweets sir,

492
00:32:42,987 --> 00:32:44,827
let it go so for just this one time sir... Please sir

493
00:32:44,947 --> 00:32:47,827
Do not put me into trouble bringing
sweet like this as my wife likes sweet

494
00:32:47,987 --> 00:32:50,408
None else can save that girl than my son, sir.

495
00:32:53,408 --> 00:32:54,448
Hey
Sir

496
00:32:55,198 --> 00:32:57,078
This is the matter related to the life of a girl

497
00:32:57,538 --> 00:33:00,159
You know about him and his track record?

498
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:03,119
You know about our track record?
We won cup over your Police team.

499
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:05,409
We won the hearts sir

500
00:33:05,489 --> 00:33:06,909
useless fellow...

501
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:08,539
Sorry..can't help.

502
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:09,699
Sir

503
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,200
Anantha Lakshmi

504
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,740
Sir...

505
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,540
Somehow my son should be...
Sir, my mom is dying sir.

506
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,411
Fulfill her last wish and put me in the Police team sir
Please sir, I beg you sir

507
00:33:21,451 --> 00:33:23,991
I missed serial last night.

508
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:25,991
Keep it in recording as there
would be the repeat telecast.

509
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:28,161
I got heart attack and will call back again, ok?

510
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:29,871
She is ruined it

511
00:33:33,492 --> 00:33:37,122
Sir, I thought heart pain.
But, it is the gas pain

512
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:41,662
Good, you can try in serials.
Definitely we will try sir

513
00:33:42,623 --> 00:33:44,663
Hey Bujji... What is the face expression of IG sir?

514
00:33:44,743 --> 00:33:46,993
It is glowing in between power and ego

515
00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:48,373
I did not like

516
00:33:49,663 --> 00:33:50,413
Tell dear..

517
00:33:51,703 --> 00:33:53,124
Did Anantha Lakshmi come with sweets?

518
00:33:53,334 --> 00:33:53,954
Not that dear

519
00:33:54,164 --> 00:33:57,124
Put her son in the job she asked
and bring those sweets home

520
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:57,914
Hello..

521
00:34:01,294 --> 00:34:03,044
Wait... Salute him

522
00:34:03,414 --> 00:34:07,875
It is good for you now to go home with
the sweets than with empty hands sir

523
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:10,955
Hey Bujji... What is the face expression of IG sir?

524
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:13,495
It is struggling in between wife and duty

525
00:34:14,796 --> 00:34:16,376
It is laughing time

526
00:34:22,456 --> 00:34:23,996
Mrs Anantha Lakshmi, come

527
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,667
I am putting your son in this operation.

528
00:34:29,087 --> 00:34:30,877
He should not overact, should clean the vehicle.

529
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:35,377
He should keep the house clean and also cook, Ok?

530
00:34:35,497 --> 00:34:37,708
A bit left... A bit up...

531
00:34:39,798 --> 00:34:40,958
Hey, what are you doing?

532
00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:42,748
You gave a sweet news right sir
and I am feeding you sweet

533
00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:47,249
Take the basket and keep it in the vehicle

534
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,999
Anantha Lakshmi, you did it

535
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:52,799
Ok, where is that girl now?

536
00:36:08,886 --> 00:36:09,846
Why are you stopping?

537
00:36:30,508 --> 00:36:32,308
Woman's perfume... That means a girl

538
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:36,509
I do not know your language,
but I will say in the language I know

539
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:38,759
The music you played is very good.

540
00:36:40,509 --> 00:36:41,759
But there is some pain in that.

541
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,930
If happiness adds to your music,
it would be further great

542
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,220
Lucky, come...
Yes, coming

543
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,680
Lucky... Very nice name,

544
00:36:53,891 --> 00:36:55,471
but I think I heard this name somewhere

545
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:57,351
Hello madam...

546
00:36:57,851 --> 00:36:58,641
Oh God!

547
00:36:58,811 --> 00:37:00,721
Hey, we came for that same girl

548
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:03,181
Lucky!

549
00:37:05,512 --> 00:37:08,602
I will not leave from here without adding happiness.

550
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:09,812
Get fixed!

551
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:23,723
My relatives avoided me when I was in problems

552
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:28,304
You gave me a shelter as a friend, thanks dear
Why so much sentiment, come on move

553
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:31,804
Hello..

554
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:36,224
Sorry

555
00:37:40,975 --> 00:37:42,435
Good morning
Good morning dad

556
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:56,186
Gayatri... I am leaving

557
00:38:02,517 --> 00:38:04,727
Pandu...I am leaving

558
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:06,017
Oh no daddy, stop daddy

559
00:38:08,898 --> 00:38:10,188
Yes, I am dead

560
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:17,188
To save, it is not the stool to pull. It is the rope

561
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:19,269
To take the charger...

562
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:26,729
Oh no, it is hurt badly..
That is why I said to try my cotton saree.

563
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:28,189
My scarf is better than that, right?

564
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:30,230
Aunty, what is this?

565
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,270
This is the story that runs daily in our house dear

566
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,980
What exactly happened uncle?

567
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,400
Into my life living like king in the Tea estate,

568
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:43,401
That rascal Babji, my bank manager friend entered

569
00:38:44,151 --> 00:38:45,601
it is me

570
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:51,942
To reach his target, he gave me 5 Lakh loan by
force though I did not need

571
00:38:52,192 --> 00:38:54,022
Because it is my profession

572
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:58,022
Once his hand fell, all my business became a zero

573
00:38:58,902 --> 00:39:04,313
Adding another zero to the given 5 Lakh,
he cheated me saying to pay a total of 50 Lakhs

574
00:39:04,483 --> 00:39:06,353
Because I am merciless

575
00:39:06,563 --> 00:39:09,813
He seized my tea estate for 25 lakhs

576
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:15,524
He is saying to seize even this house
if another 25 lakhs is not paid in four days

577
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:17,564
Because I am ruthless

578
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:20,354
It happened so at a time when we were very happy

579
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:25,355
That God is always so aunty, he disturbs only those happy

580
00:39:25,485 --> 00:39:28,155
That bloody bank Babji fellow...

581
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:31,025
Prasad...

582
00:39:32,235 --> 00:39:32,985
Mummy

583
00:39:34,776 --> 00:39:37,566
How many pockets would be there
for the Jean pant of Aurangzeb?

584
00:39:39,696 --> 00:39:44,737
4 Pockets if Jeans pants were there those days

585
00:39:45,357 --> 00:39:46,277
Wrong answer

586
00:39:51,657 --> 00:39:53,277
Mummy, no! Your hand will pain

587
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:01,198
Why did grandma hit?

588
00:40:01,488 --> 00:40:06,489
In the starting days of smart phone arrival,
our old man... I mean my dad...

589
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,819
I will start if you stop the works

590
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,489
My dad climbed onto a stone for taking
selfie with mom in the beach

591
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,410
Our old man is very romantic
and pinched cheek of mom in the gap

592
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,740
Mom is very shy and pushed him at once

593
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,070
That is all, old man slipped and fell so into the sea

594
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:28,241
Mom went into a shock.

595
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:31,111
I set up a library to relax mom

596
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:36,161
She is relaxing a bit high reading books continuously

597
00:40:37,282 --> 00:40:39,032
Prasad...
Yes

598
00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:42,072
What is the car number of Srikrishnadevarayalu?

599
00:40:42,202 --> 00:40:48,413
It was Samaikyandhra then,
so AP and if you take 12 it is 1234

600
00:40:48,573 --> 00:40:49,493
Wrong answer

601
00:40:52,323 --> 00:40:53,323
Hey, that is my leg

602
00:40:54,323 --> 00:40:57,493
This is the house Lucky stays and this
is the guest house you would be staying

603
00:40:59,574 --> 00:41:01,454
Boys... suspect... Take positions

604
00:41:01,494 --> 00:41:01,994
Yes sir

605
00:41:03,364 --> 00:41:04,614
Hey Bujji, what happened?

606
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:06,074
Looks like some Militant has come

607
00:41:06,204 --> 00:41:08,244
Hey, come on stop
Please

608
00:41:08,284 --> 00:41:09,785
What is their nonsense?
Something is in the jacket

609
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:11,535
Who is he?
Stop, do not go near

610
00:41:11,915 --> 00:41:13,165
Milk smell... He is a milk man Bujji

611
00:41:13,205 --> 00:41:14,245
Milk man?
Yes sir

612
00:41:14,285 --> 00:41:15,865
Ok, go and pour

613
00:41:16,165 --> 00:41:16,915
Milk man sir

614
00:41:17,995 --> 00:41:18,745
Enough, bring it down,

615
00:41:19,325 --> 00:41:20,706
you badly failed before him as CI

616
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:22,666
It is alright sir, failure is the stepping stone of success

617
00:41:22,706 --> 00:41:24,036
Hey, stop it. Move...

618
00:41:24,456 --> 00:41:26,166
Do you feel that
girl is safe with these three idiots Bujji?

619
00:41:26,956 --> 00:41:27,706
Hey
What happened?

620
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:29,166
Those three idiots are still here
My foot

621
00:41:30,827 --> 00:41:33,247
We searched whole of Andhra and
Telangana and found no where sir

622
00:41:33,497 --> 00:41:35,747
We searched all districts in Tamilnadu
and found no where sir

623
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:38,707
We searched all places in Karnataka sir,
not found anywhere

624
00:41:39,617 --> 00:41:41,708
We searched whole Kerala sir,
that girl was found no where

625
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:45,368
She is not in South states means
she would definitely be in North states

626
00:41:45,918 --> 00:41:46,668
Go for West Bengal,

627
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:48,538
Manipur, Orissa...

628
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,418
No chance for that girl to be in North sir

629
00:41:51,288 --> 00:41:54,499
Last phone call she did after escaping
from this incident was to the IG.

630
00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:55,579
This is the call data sir.

631
00:41:55,869 --> 00:41:58,619
She with the help of Police is definitely
taking shelter in twin cities

632
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,959
Give time for two days and that girl will be before you

633
00:42:01,499 --> 00:42:04,000
Daddy, you appointed this fellow right?

634
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,120
Yes my son

635
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,420
Bless me daddy
Mercy of the Goddess

636
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,710
He is very sharp. All of you follow this fellow

637
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,291
Hey, you work better.
My son appreciated for the first time,

638
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:15,461
mercy of Goddess..
Ok sir

639
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:20,671
Good morning sir

640
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,622
As we thought, I diverted Deva in the matter of the girl sir

641
00:42:28,252 --> 00:42:30,582
No chance that he gets to know where Lucky is

642
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:35,873
Not just that, we shall gather many secrets from him

643
00:42:36,003 --> 00:42:38,383
All those evidences are in the secret room of his
generator factory sir.

644
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:39,613
We will get for sure.

645
00:42:40,713 --> 00:42:41,293
Ok sir

646
00:42:45,754 --> 00:42:48,044
Sir, Sir
Yes

647
00:42:49,874 --> 00:42:52,294
Hello, we came new into this opposite house.

648
00:42:52,584 --> 00:42:54,044
Will you give if we need some grocery?

649
00:42:54,584 --> 00:42:56,505
Are you Telugu?
How did you make out sir?

650
00:42:56,835 --> 00:42:59,625
As you were trying to mingle on the name of
grocery immediately after you came...

651
00:43:00,005 --> 00:43:01,465
Only we will have this talent.

652
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,755
What is he struggling for?
To give a shake hand

653
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:06,466
He is blind sir, cannot see

654
00:43:07,216 --> 00:43:10,086
He does not look so.
That is why I say to hold the stick.

655
00:43:10,176 --> 00:43:12,046
You are high in styles

656
00:43:12,796 --> 00:43:15,426
Stick and the spectacles sir.
Check if you have any doubts sir

657
00:43:16,296 --> 00:43:17,757
How many fingers are these?
Four

658
00:43:18,627 --> 00:43:19,677
No, once more

659
00:43:21,927 --> 00:43:24,127
How many fingers are these?
He is out

660
00:43:24,177 --> 00:43:24,927
Two

661
00:43:25,127 --> 00:43:28,088
How will they believe if you say it all so?
What to do? I am lucky and everything is matching

662
00:43:28,218 --> 00:43:29,468
One minute sir

663
00:43:30,218 --> 00:43:31,008
How many are these fingers?

664
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:32,588
Have you raised or not?
He is raised

665
00:43:32,718 --> 00:43:33,378
Then five

666
00:43:37,338 --> 00:43:41,179
Whatever you need... Do not come to our house

667
00:43:41,379 --> 00:43:42,049
Why sir?

668
00:43:42,379 --> 00:43:44,759
There are two grown up girls in the house

669
00:43:46,379 --> 00:43:47,129
They have grown well

670
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,550
There are two more inside

671
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,180
Oh..!

672
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,630
On the whole we introduced on the very first day

673
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,630
Yes, but what are our idiots doing?
Silence, they are right here

674
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,090
Hey, what are these meetings with him?

675
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,881
We have come to save that girl.
What will we get just by following?

676
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:04,091
If we talk and introduce with that girl,
we can be by her side for 24 hours right?

677
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:06,761
You were brought as extra players.
Do not overact, go and look into the cooking works

678
00:44:06,931 --> 00:44:08,091
Bujji
Yes dear

679
00:44:08,511 --> 00:44:10,552
We shall cook with spoilt tomatoes
We shall put even rotten vegetables

680
00:44:10,932 --> 00:44:13,882
Ok boys, we from tomorrow would
follow that girl and make friendship

681
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:16,052
Being a CI, do you think stealing
idea of an assistant is correct sir?

682
00:44:16,222 --> 00:44:17,682
A police cannot become a thief sir

683
00:44:17,762 --> 00:44:18,882
Hey, stop your idiotic nonsense

684
00:44:19,382 --> 00:44:20,763
Come on boys, let us do it

685
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:23,723
They are stealing our plan

686
00:44:24,513 --> 00:44:26,723
Bujji, what are the face expressions of those three?

687
00:44:26,883 --> 00:44:29,013
Glowing in between cunningness and characterless

688
00:44:29,513 --> 00:44:32,304
I did not like at all
Then he is dead

689
00:44:36,194 --> 00:44:39,294
This is Batasia Loop view point,
very famous in Darjeeling.

690
00:44:39,604 --> 00:44:40,194
All the best, sir.

691
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,495
It will be very helpful to me if you teach Violin to me.

692
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:45,945
Madam, please. We are very poor.

693
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:49,035
We will follow you.

694
00:44:49,165 --> 00:44:52,116
Lucky, there may be some idiots in Darjeeling. Just ignore them.

695
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:54,496
Stop, idiots. Stop.

696
00:44:54,876 --> 00:44:57,616
This fellow cheated my daughter. We found him here.

697
00:44:57,806 --> 00:44:58,166
What happened?

698
00:44:58,436 --> 00:44:59,316
Which subject he asked you to teach?

699
00:44:59,506 --> 00:45:00,116
Violin!

700
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,216
He asked us to teach Guitar.

701
00:45:01,376 --> 00:45:02,366
Was it me?
My daughter said, no.

702
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:03,717
He said that his family is poor.

703
00:45:03,977 --> 00:45:04,927
He made her pregnant.

704
00:45:04,987 --> 00:45:05,387
Pregnant?

705
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:07,317
Don't believe them. I don't even know them.

706
00:45:07,517 --> 00:45:08,517
He is lying.

707
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,147
What is this? It is very strong?

708
00:45:10,327 --> 00:45:11,947
Baby got angry. Baby, go to sleep.

709
00:45:13,418 --> 00:45:14,608
What did you do when he did this much?

710
00:45:14,808 --> 00:45:15,828
He will beat our mouth.

711
00:45:16,398 --> 00:45:17,658
I will beat his nose.

712
00:45:19,098 --> 00:45:22,238
To teach me Violin in Darjeeling, you said that I made pregnant her.

713
00:45:22,438 --> 00:45:23,939
It's like this in Darjeeling.

714
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:28,369
Sir!

715
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:30,819
What is this?

716
00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:32,959
We planned jointly to make friendship
with Lucky.

717
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:34,770
We put our talents in this resume, sir.

718
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:38,240
We give this letter to Mr. Prasad and convince him to give us jobs
and will settle in their house.

719
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,090
He already have debts.
How can he give you jobs?

720
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,760
That's why we mentioned in 5th line as,
'we will join even by giving the salary in opposite.'

721
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,981
He didn't study correctly as his nose was broken.

722
00:45:46,181 --> 00:45:46,581
Stop this.

723
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:47,971
Carry on as per your wish.

724
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:49,331
I changed it.

725
00:45:52,261 --> 00:45:53,121
What are you guys doing here?

726
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:54,741
We are playong the game.

727
00:45:55,341 --> 00:45:56,752
You are sitting side and side and
how can you play the game?

728
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,092
Bujji! Are you beside me? Out.

729
00:45:59,782 --> 00:46:00,632
You go and do your work.

730
00:46:01,142 --> 00:46:02,132
Crazy fellows and their blind games.

731
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:03,632
Bujji! They will be finished.

732
00:46:08,553 --> 00:46:09,073
What is this?

733
00:46:09,393 --> 00:46:11,223
We wrote our talents to get a job at you.

734
00:46:11,493 --> 00:46:13,093
'Dear! My heart's Rhythm.'

735
00:46:17,334 --> 00:46:18,734
In these two, to whom you wrote this?

736
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:20,734
I am also beautiful.

737
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:25,724
In these three, to whom you wrote this?

738
00:46:26,154 --> 00:46:26,464
Disgusting!

739
00:46:26,704 --> 00:46:28,325
We didn't write it to the ladies. We wrote it to you.

740
00:46:30,405 --> 00:46:31,425
Who wrote this among you both?

741
00:46:31,685 --> 00:46:33,645
Whatever we do, we do it unitedly.

742
00:46:35,885 --> 00:46:37,415
Matter seems very odd.

743
00:46:37,905 --> 00:46:39,296
All ladies go inside.

744
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,016
"When your lip beauty is provocating us..'

745
00:46:47,176 --> 00:46:49,447
'Your chest beauty is disturbing us..'

746
00:46:52,487 --> 00:46:54,077
'Your legs are like banana branches..'

747
00:46:55,027 --> 00:46:56,707
'Your waist is like the paithon..'

748
00:46:57,137 --> 00:46:58,997
While watching them, we are spending many sleepless nights.

749
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:02,258
They have caught.

750
00:47:03,878 --> 00:47:06,148
We will satisfy even by giving the salary in opposite.

751
00:47:07,008 --> 00:47:07,668
Giving in opposite?

752
00:47:07,878 --> 00:47:09,348
It's not a matter, how much it may be.
We can pay.

753
00:47:09,818 --> 00:47:11,189
Is this plan also failed?

754
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:11,939
Ye, obsolutely.

755
00:47:13,149 --> 00:47:18,729
Prasad! Rajnikanth killed how many persons in Sepoy's revolt?

756
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,420
He asked the question in a wrong way, sir.

757
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:24,090
You may go and correct that.

758
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:24,770
Definitely, sir.

759
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:30,610
Grandma! Rajnikanth is a film actor. Robo, Robo2, Narasimha.

760
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:31,290
Wrong answer.

761
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:37,541
She left you by just beating.

762
00:47:38,241 --> 00:47:42,602
If you bring this kind of crazy letters again, I will kill you.

763
00:47:47,012 --> 00:47:48,772
Do they kill in Darjeeling, if we give resume?

764
00:47:48,912 --> 00:47:50,422
It's like this in Darjeeling.

765
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:55,043
Hey Bujji, we shall make friends first with Lucky

766
00:47:55,713 --> 00:47:56,423
We should not give them that chance

767
00:47:56,933 --> 00:47:59,143
Are your eyes lost, idiot?
Yes, will you give yours?

768
00:47:59,223 --> 00:48:00,763
You have the eyes and can you not see rascal?

769
00:48:00,933 --> 00:48:03,304
Every person with eyes walks
keeping them over the head.

770
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:05,894
That girl is going not caring even after seeing us
Is it?

771
00:48:06,724 --> 00:48:08,144
Lucky, I cannot see.

772
00:48:08,264 --> 00:48:10,804
But you can see, right?
Why do you go not caring even after seeing?

773
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:13,804
Lucky, I already said to
add happiness to your music right?

774
00:48:13,935 --> 00:48:15,185
Yes, even the bell rang.

775
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,895
Shake hands, let us be friends Lucky.

776
00:48:18,015 --> 00:48:20,435
Lucky...
What is your problem?

777
00:48:20,605 --> 00:48:22,265
To add happiness to your music...

778
00:48:22,685 --> 00:48:23,765
You know what is beside you?

779
00:48:23,855 --> 00:48:25,556
My Bujji

780
00:48:25,856 --> 00:48:26,516
On the other side

781
00:48:27,856 --> 00:48:30,146
Yes, that one
A stone, so what?

782
00:48:30,436 --> 00:48:32,856
I too will not have any feelings
or emotions similar to that,

783
00:48:33,436 --> 00:48:34,106
I am like a stone

784
00:48:36,017 --> 00:48:37,437
I do not need any happiness.

785
00:48:38,307 --> 00:48:40,807
I am just inexpressive like this stone

786
00:48:41,857 --> 00:48:44,147
What is it Bujji?
When we said to be happy why does she say stone?

787
00:48:44,227 --> 00:48:45,397
Let us melt that
Is it?

788
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:01,439
Lucky stone... Lucky smile...

789
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:04,609
Your inexpressiveness becomes so expressive

790
00:49:04,689 --> 00:49:06,729
People expressing expressions expressively.

791
00:49:06,769 --> 00:49:08,020
How is it Bujji?
It is like Tweet of RGV

792
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:08,940
Then, it is not understood

793
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,400
That is why she is leaving getting confused
How can she go so?

794
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,060
Pull

795
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:29,562
The stone said not to have any expression became
attraction yesterday and devotion today.

796
00:49:29,652 --> 00:49:30,442
How is this Bujji?

797
00:49:30,612 --> 00:49:32,192
There is clarity like the Tweet of Rajamouli

798
00:49:32,232 --> 00:49:32,982
Then, she understood

799
00:49:33,022 --> 00:49:34,272
That is why, she stopped and is thinking

800
00:49:36,232 --> 00:49:40,563
When a lifeless stone changes so many colors,
how many colors shall we with life change?

801
00:49:42,903 --> 00:49:43,943
Life is like a painting.

802
00:49:44,403 --> 00:49:47,113
Picture comes as beautiful as we draw with our hands

803
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:51,024
Problems always follow like our shadow.

804
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:53,694
If we stop just watching that,
how can we march ahead Lucky?

805
00:49:56,024 --> 00:49:57,404
Lucky...
Huh, she is leaving

806
00:49:57,984 --> 00:50:01,315
Lucky, I will give you happiness
and then I will go. I asked the God

807
00:50:07,315 --> 00:50:08,405
I asked the God

808
00:50:10,445 --> 00:50:11,486
I asked the God

809
00:50:17,316 --> 00:50:18,156
Let us be friends

810
00:50:22,277 --> 00:50:24,277
My feeling is that your plan will not work out sir.
Yes sir

811
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:31,567
No, what is he made friends with that girl before us?

812
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,318
Ok, I am leaving bye

813
00:50:33,368 --> 00:50:35,778
We will come tomorrow by 12 for lunch,
Inform Prasad garu

814
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,488
Hey, how did you make friends to that girl even before us?

815
00:50:39,568 --> 00:50:41,238
Bujji...Say it in pace

816
00:50:44,279 --> 00:50:45,869
How did she become friend by painting the stones?

817
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,659
Our planning is like that

818
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:50,529
That means, the plan we did whole night is a waste?

819
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:51,369
Bujji
Yes

820
00:50:51,409 --> 00:50:52,159
What is their face expression?

821
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:54,570
It is shattered in between depression and hopeless

822
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,200
Yes... it is laughing time

823
00:51:04,241 --> 00:51:05,621
Happy birthday Minister Sir

824
00:51:05,701 --> 00:51:07,281
Oh no, he gets irritated if I am in spectacles

825
00:51:09,571 --> 00:51:10,241
Happy birthday Minister sir

826
00:51:10,281 --> 00:51:11,621
Thank you, come and be seated

827
00:51:12,571 --> 00:51:13,871
Our Party President
Hello

828
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:14,571
Mylar Gadda

829
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,072
Deva
Hello sir

830
00:51:16,662 --> 00:51:19,282
Minister sir,
what gift are you giving me for your birthday?

831
00:51:21,452 --> 00:51:23,662
What is me giving a gift for my birthday?

832
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:27,163
Your smile is very irritating

833
00:51:28,243 --> 00:51:30,243
Daddy, why does he smile when we ask for gift?

834
00:51:31,073 --> 00:51:35,163
How many gifts have we given for his birthday?
Farm house, guest house, Kokapet land...

835
00:51:35,323 --> 00:51:37,574
And when he wanted that heroine...
Oh no, ask what gift do you want?

836
00:51:37,874 --> 00:51:40,284
Last wish of my brother was me to enter politics.

837
00:51:40,784 --> 00:51:43,164
That is why I am wishing to become
MLA of this constitution.

838
00:51:47,745 --> 00:51:48,995
You should not smile, he gets irritation

839
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:50,875
Why are you laughing?

840
00:51:50,955 --> 00:51:54,035
Deva, our constituency had
bi-election just recently right?

841
00:51:54,285 --> 00:51:57,286
There is the sitting MLA having sweet seated happily

842
00:51:57,326 --> 00:51:57,876
Hi bro.

843
00:52:08,787 --> 00:52:11,207
There will be an option here to resign,
do you know that?

844
00:52:11,497 --> 00:52:12,247
Yes, a point

845
00:52:16,247 --> 00:52:17,037
That will not work

846
00:52:17,287 --> 00:52:19,328
I will work if you take me to hospital.

847
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:23,288
To Government hospital?
Please take me to corporate hospital

848
00:52:23,498 --> 00:52:25,328
Sorry bro
It is ok bro

849
00:52:25,578 --> 00:52:28,878
Deva, I will talk to CM about your ticket.

850
00:52:29,209 --> 00:52:32,249
You should stop all these murders to enter politics.

851
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:33,919
Just one murder,

852
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:37,499
I will kill the lady responsible for the
death of my brother and then stop

853
00:52:37,669 --> 00:52:40,580
Post plus life is equal to the peace of
the soul of my brother

854
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,790
Suicide...

855
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,001
Yes, why did I forget to commit suicide today?

856
00:52:55,711 --> 00:52:58,581
Prasad sir...
Will you give some grocery?

857
00:52:58,711 --> 00:53:01,172
Have you come to Darjeeling for the grocery?

858
00:53:01,792 --> 00:53:05,082
Still, I am hanging myself and they are not there

859
00:53:05,252 --> 00:53:06,502
Go on, we will wait.

860
00:53:06,542 --> 00:53:08,832
I am not making Snacks, but hanging myself

861
00:53:08,882 --> 00:53:09,632
Hanging...

862
00:53:09,882 --> 00:53:15,133
Is it that in which you swing badly,
eyes come out, tongue goes stretched

863
00:53:15,423 --> 00:53:17,883
I wish to listen to the final scream Bujji

864
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:20,793
Oh no, he is getting down from the stool
No, how can that be...

865
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:22,214
Here, he is sitting in the Sofa

866
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:26,544
Why do you still tense him,
when he is already in tension?

867
00:53:27,294 --> 00:53:29,424
He helped me when I was in problem.

868
00:53:30,084 --> 00:53:32,294
I am unable to do anything now when he is in problem.

869
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,255
Then, are you happy if his problem is solved now?

870
00:53:34,505 --> 00:53:35,545
Come on Bujji
Coming

871
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:38,925
Prasad sir, what is your problem?

872
00:53:40,465 --> 00:53:42,135
I will not blindly follow the blind people

873
00:53:42,795 --> 00:53:43,676
Prasad

874
00:53:46,336 --> 00:53:48,636
How many runs did Kohli make in Kurukshetra?

875
00:53:52,176 --> 00:53:54,297
This is a very intelligent question grandma,
I do not know

876
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:55,967
Correct answer

877
00:53:59,387 --> 00:54:00,467
How did you manage?

878
00:54:00,507 --> 00:54:02,337
I understood that she is mad immediately
after listening to her question

879
00:54:02,507 --> 00:54:04,758
Either we answer or correct
the mental people, their ego gets hurt

880
00:54:04,838 --> 00:54:06,758
Their ego is satisfied if we say not to know

881
00:54:07,588 --> 00:54:09,928
I have been getting beaten from
so many years not knowing this logic

882
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:12,508
From now, I will blindly follow you

883
00:54:13,088 --> 00:54:14,888
What happened was...
Say in short

884
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:16,339
That happened...

885
00:54:16,429 --> 00:54:17,389
Very simple matter

886
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:18,759
You should pay 25 to bank.

887
00:54:18,799 --> 00:54:20,299
How much will you get mortgaging the house?
25

888
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:21,719
We will pay that in the bank
Then house?

889
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,009
We will get the same 25 and pay for the house

890
00:54:23,049 --> 00:54:24,389
How can we pay one 25 at so many places?

891
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:25,719
We will loot that 25 paid in bank

892
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,010
Bank robbery?

893
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,220
Bank robbery?

894
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,840
Bank robbery? I too will come

895
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,640
That is not a function, but a robbery.

896
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:39,051
A lady is not week but strong
Not week, but weak

897
00:54:39,701 --> 00:54:42,621
Tabla means to beat.

898
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:46,071
Sabala is the lady who should able to do.

899
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,942
I am the don. I am the don.

900
00:54:52,232 --> 00:54:55,282
We accept this bank robbery for just you will make
friendship to me with Lucky.

901
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:57,903
Wait and watch. How will I highlight you.

902
00:54:58,123 --> 00:55:00,893
Raja! Why did you take him to the places
where ladies are there?

903
00:55:01,453 --> 00:55:03,023
Why did you take him to the places
where gents are there?

904
00:55:03,293 --> 00:55:05,463
Lucky! Prasad garu. These are our people.

905
00:55:05,733 --> 00:55:06,583
They committed mistake unknowingly.

906
00:55:06,783 --> 00:55:08,233
These useless people will be helpful to this work.

907
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,164
Boys! Say sorry to them.

908
00:55:10,814 --> 00:55:11,794
Sorry, sir.

909
00:55:13,384 --> 00:55:17,984
Will they get afraid if they see this fake gun?

910
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:19,455
You press the trigger on the time.

911
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:21,565
I will press remote on the time.

912
00:55:21,865 --> 00:55:23,345
Then, the bullets will be come out on the time.

913
00:55:23,555 --> 00:55:24,885
Everything will be on timing.

914
00:55:32,646 --> 00:55:34,436
Sir, come sir... This is our bank.

915
00:55:34,556 --> 00:55:36,346
Ours is the number one bank in Darjeeling sir

916
00:55:36,726 --> 00:55:38,516
Sir.. He is Mr.Kotarao.

917
00:55:38,976 --> 00:55:41,227
He came to deposit a crore in our bank

918
00:55:41,347 --> 00:55:42,807
Yes... Come and see the bank then

919
00:55:42,897 --> 00:55:43,767
Sir, he is blind

920
00:55:44,057 --> 00:55:46,517
Then we will reduce some zeroes in crore...

921
00:55:46,557 --> 00:55:48,017
What are you saying sir?
Nothing

922
00:55:51,058 --> 00:55:52,978
Manager sir, we paid our loan.

923
00:55:53,148 --> 00:55:55,018
Now, we have no relation
who ever loots the money now

924
00:55:55,098 --> 00:55:57,188
What is looting? Will thieves rob our bank or what?

925
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:58,808
Who else is a bigger thief than me in this bank?

926
00:56:01,228 --> 00:56:03,349
Hey, it is a joke...

927
00:56:03,399 --> 00:56:05,599
Thief...

928
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,150
We are very cruel robbers.

929
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:20,400
Manager, we have come

930
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,150
Why are you saying me?

931
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,901
Hands up
Hey, hands up

932
00:56:25,851 --> 00:56:26,731
Oh no, who is this fellow?

933
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:29,021
What is he coming over with such a body?

934
00:56:29,101 --> 00:56:31,651
Body builder is going like a bull dozer
and he would lift both of them up

935
00:56:32,061 --> 00:56:35,152
Shoulder surgery sir, I can lift hands.
I will lift the legs

936
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:39,442
Thank you sir

937
00:56:42,022 --> 00:56:44,353
They look like toy guns
There are two in my house

938
00:56:46,353 --> 00:56:47,443
Toy guns?

939
00:56:48,853 --> 00:56:55,274
You rascal, do you say ours are toy guns?
We will prove right away

940
00:56:56,194 --> 00:56:57,194
Who is first?
Who?

941
00:56:57,234 --> 00:56:59,024
Me... Shoot me

942
00:57:03,944 --> 00:57:06,105
Who is next?
Me

943
00:57:06,275 --> 00:57:07,355
You too will be shot

944
00:57:08,985 --> 00:57:09,985
Vandematharam

945
00:57:10,105 --> 00:57:13,065
What is that? Why did they dies to coming
for taking Adhar card photo?

946
00:57:13,565 --> 00:57:16,526
I have some doubt, come on shoot him

947
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:17,066
Sir.

948
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,777
Why did you shoot that guy when
I said to shoot this fellow?

949
00:57:29,857 --> 00:57:30,607
We did not like him

950
00:57:30,737 --> 00:57:31,737
They shoot if they do not like right?

951
00:57:31,817 --> 00:57:34,527
Maybe they shoot only those they like
Correct, we like him

952
00:57:34,657 --> 00:57:35,607
You liked right? Shoot

953
00:57:35,737 --> 00:57:37,528
We shall kill the guy we do not like
before shooting the liked fellow

954
00:57:37,568 --> 00:57:38,908
He is the guy you do not like, right?
Why not shoot?

955
00:57:39,238 --> 00:57:40,908
To kill the guy we do not like before
shooting the liked fellow means

956
00:57:40,948 --> 00:57:42,358
we shall shoot the guy liked
and we did not like in between

957
00:57:42,738 --> 00:57:44,068
Did you understand anything?

958
00:57:44,198 --> 00:57:46,568
That is, now shooting the liked
and not shooting the un liked and like...

959
00:57:46,608 --> 00:57:47,408
Shut up...

960
00:57:48,489 --> 00:57:51,069
Instead of these likes and shooting,
do whatever you like...

961
00:57:53,029 --> 00:57:53,779
Take out the money...

962
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:57,909
Some sound of pressing
phone numbers is coming here?

963
00:57:58,239 --> 00:57:59,570
I called the Police

964
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:03,320
None of you get into tension,
bank manager is calling the Police

965
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:05,610
Is this any matter to announce?

966
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:06,700
No idea sir, I cannot see

967
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,030
Is there any relation to my question
and your answer?

968
00:58:10,241 --> 00:58:12,661
There are personal videos bro,
do not upload in the net

969
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,991
Wow, I phone 7... Give it to me daddy

970
00:58:18,241 --> 00:58:19,161
Why is she saying you daddy?

971
00:58:19,321 --> 00:58:21,322
It is wrong dear, you should
not call thieves as daddy for phones.

972
00:58:21,362 --> 00:58:22,282
They would hit you

973
00:58:26,112 --> 00:58:28,992
He looks very cruel.
He hit two when that fellow said one

974
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:29,572
No way out

975
00:58:29,612 --> 00:58:32,613
Cashier...Take out 25 Lakhs money

976
00:58:33,073 --> 00:58:34,993
Please say, how can I help you?

977
00:58:35,743 --> 00:58:37,283
Keep the money
I will not

978
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:39,613
We will blast your bank with bombs
Go ahead and blast

979
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,034
We will shoot you
Go ahead and shoot

980
00:58:41,114 --> 00:58:43,574
We will kidnap your mom and dad
I am an orphan

981
00:58:43,704 --> 00:58:45,994
We will kill your dearest wife
I am a bachelor

982
00:58:47,244 --> 00:58:49,704
Another matter, I put a message
to Police and they are coming

983
00:58:50,784 --> 00:58:53,285
It seems Police are coming
and he is not giving the money.

984
00:58:53,495 --> 00:58:54,615
What to do now?

985
00:58:54,665 --> 00:58:57,745
He is saying bachelor right?
Show some beautiful girl and ask her to request cutely

986
00:58:58,575 --> 00:58:59,455
What do you say Manager sir?

987
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:01,035
Hey, have you come to deposit or for robbery?

988
00:59:01,075 --> 00:59:02,456
No idea sir, I cannot see
You cannot see?

989
00:59:05,866 --> 00:59:07,456
Not really, but just for fun

990
00:59:08,826 --> 00:59:13,247
It seems they would kill me,
why not give the money Siddarth?

991
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:18,867
Why did he connect to that fat babe?

992
00:59:18,917 --> 00:59:20,207
Is he connected, thank God

993
00:59:20,247 --> 00:59:21,117
Call again

994
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:22,327
Siddarth

995
00:59:31,248 --> 00:59:32,118
Yes, 25 Lakhs

996
00:59:33,578 --> 00:59:35,169
I put 50 when you asked 25

997
00:59:36,919 --> 00:59:38,169
50... Wow, double

998
00:59:38,499 --> 00:59:40,249
Hey, have you come to deposit or for robbery?

999
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:41,329
No idea sir, I cannot see

1000
00:59:42,289 --> 00:59:44,039
Sir, Police are coming

1001
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,000
Police? Boys, escape...

1002
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,080
What are those dead bodies getting up and running?

1003
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:48,830
Maybe they got frightened

1004
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:50,330
Shut up, what is dead bodies getting frightened?

1005
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:51,370
No idea sir, I cannot see

Hey, stop else I will shoot

1007
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,171
Manager sir, I heard in many English movies.

1008
00:59:57,251 --> 01:00:00,001
It seems thieves take hostage of innocent girls
and run away in such situations right?

1009
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:02,001
We are the innocent girls in this bank
Yes, us

1010
01:00:02,081 --> 01:00:06,042
Hey, all guns down... Shall I say you in special?

1011
01:00:08,672 --> 01:00:10,332
What is happening here?
Robbery sir

1012
01:00:10,462 --> 01:00:12,252
I can see that
No idea sir, I cannot see

1013
01:00:12,872 --> 01:00:15,122
Yes, success for the first time.

1014
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:16,713
Move

1015
01:00:17,873 --> 01:00:19,713
Police sir, I will catch the thief for you

1016
01:00:22,423 --> 01:00:25,083
Here.. black sweater
Zoom it.

1017
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:31,424
It is my mannerism

1018
01:00:32,124 --> 01:00:34,584
You bloody..it's all your plan right!
come to police station

1019
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:35,674
One minute,

1020
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:40,425
Will only thieves escape and do
bank managers not escape in English films?

1021
01:00:40,585 --> 01:00:41,875
Why not, they will?

1022
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:45,255
Say to have done a mock drill for the
awareness of customers.

1023
01:00:45,335 --> 01:00:46,005
Yes..

1024
01:00:46,255 --> 01:00:47,045
What about the lost 50 Lakhs?

1025
01:00:47,085 --> 01:00:48,465
Take out from your account and deposit in bank

1026
01:00:48,676 --> 01:00:49,756
No..
Police.

1027
01:00:51,256 --> 01:00:52,176
Okay.

1028
01:00:54,596 --> 01:00:55,346
Robbery,

1029
01:00:55,766 --> 01:00:56,766
Bank robbery?

1030
01:00:56,976 --> 01:00:57,926
Yes Ananthalakshmi,

1031
01:00:58,016 --> 01:01:01,267
We played with weakness of that bank manager
and solved the problem of Prasad sir.

1032
01:01:01,347 --> 01:01:02,427
How is Lucky, son?

1033
01:01:02,597 --> 01:01:03,847
She is just feeling better

1034
01:01:04,177 --> 01:01:05,347
Ok see you, bye darling

1035
01:01:05,387 --> 01:01:06,017
Bye son

1036
01:01:06,097 --> 01:01:09,387
Raja, you are saying darling. Who is it,
your girlfriend?

1037
01:01:09,557 --> 01:01:10,518
Yes, my mom

1038
01:01:11,848 --> 01:01:13,348
You like your mother so much?

1039
01:01:13,638 --> 01:01:14,098
My life

1040
01:01:15,098 --> 01:01:17,308
My mom is my world from the day I grew

1041
01:01:22,889 --> 01:01:23,599
Your dad, then?

1042
01:01:26,479 --> 01:01:28,729
Doctor said he will not get sight in his life.

1043
01:01:29,139 --> 01:01:29,889
We have taken the burden for 10 years.

1044
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:32,140
It is better we get rid of him now

1045
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:37,680
Thus I called the orphanage people.

1046
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:38,850
Let us hand him over to them.

1047
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,480
We will have another kid if needed

1048
01:01:43,811 --> 01:01:46,811
I and my son decided to live together for the whole life

1049
01:01:47,981 --> 01:01:50,231
You decide whether you wish to live with us or not

1050
01:01:56,602 --> 01:01:57,142
Spoon

1051
01:01:58,892 --> 01:01:59,432
Ball

1052
01:02:01,982 --> 01:02:02,812
Pin

1053
01:02:07,353 --> 01:02:08,143
Rice

1054
01:02:09,563 --> 01:02:10,433
Marigold

1055
01:02:11,233 --> 01:02:12,103
100 rupees

1056
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:18,274
You are getting him educated greatly,
what will you make him?

1057
01:02:18,524 --> 01:02:19,104
Police

1058
01:02:22,734 --> 01:02:24,435
Madam, what name shall I write for the boy?

1059
01:02:24,935 --> 01:02:26,025
Raja the great!

1060
01:02:41,316 --> 01:02:42,776
My mom taught me just one thing.

1061
01:02:43,146 --> 01:02:44,856
Life will never give us anything, Lucky

1062
01:02:45,236 --> 01:02:46,397
We should go ahead and take,

1063
01:02:47,027 --> 01:02:49,567
either happiness from sorrow or victory from the defeat

1064
01:02:59,148 --> 01:03:00,688
My problem is solved

1065
01:03:05,818 --> 01:03:06,318
Sorry.

1066
01:03:07,109 --> 01:03:09,739
I prayed to offer 1000 coconuts to Goddess

1067
01:03:12,209 --> 01:03:13,909
You know, it is not safe to bring
this girl outside like this

1068
01:03:15,589 --> 01:03:17,310
How much time did you take it to bring?

1069
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:18,230
Why are you beating?

1070
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,320
Do you know who we are? Cops.

1071
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:24,450
Caste feeling.. Caste feeling.

1072
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,700
Caste feeling? It's wrong, right?

1073
01:03:29,251 --> 01:03:29,911
Ganta baba blessings.

1074
01:03:30,111 --> 01:03:30,751
Swami! To me?

1075
01:03:30,911 --> 01:03:31,601
Ganta baba blessings.

1076
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:33,521
Bujji! Why do this priest wear clothes?

1077
01:03:33,751 --> 01:03:34,541
It's like this in Darjeeling.

1078
01:03:34,761 --> 01:03:37,281
Blind man? Don't feel bad. I will give you the blessings.

1079
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:38,431
Why is he showing sympathy on me?

1080
01:03:38,632 --> 01:03:38,842
I don't like it.

1081
01:03:39,072 --> 01:03:40,212
It's ok just for one time.
- Prasad!

1082
01:03:41,232 --> 01:03:42,902
What is the relation between Rambo and Rambha?

1083
01:03:43,132 --> 01:03:43,822
It's wrong.

1084
01:03:44,022 --> 01:03:46,122
Rambo is in Hollywood and Rambha is in Tollywood.

1085
01:03:46,352 --> 01:03:47,582
There is a lot of distance between them.

1086
01:03:48,152 --> 01:03:49,022
Wrong answer.
- He will die.

1087
01:03:49,183 --> 01:03:49,933
Did she take him?

1088
01:03:54,743 --> 01:03:55,103
He came.

1089
01:03:55,303 --> 01:03:55,863
Is she mental.

1090
01:03:56,063 --> 01:03:57,533
Don't feel bad. I will give you the blessings.

1091
01:03:59,323 --> 01:04:01,824
We have seen cold weather till now, right?

1092
01:04:02,074 --> 01:04:04,324
we now see the Goddess here once?

1093
01:04:04,864 --> 01:04:06,694
This Goddess very famous in Darjeeling

1094
01:04:06,864 --> 01:04:10,745
Not only in Darjeeling..
this temple very popular in west bengal also..

1095
01:04:11,155 --> 01:04:14,035
Celebrations of the Goddess happen
every year here at this time

1096
01:04:24,656 --> 01:04:27,906
You are presently watching the
traditional dance of people here

1097
01:04:28,246 --> 01:04:30,536
These celebrations continue for 9 days

1098
01:04:30,786 --> 01:04:33,577
Goddess is seen in different incarnation on each day

1099
01:04:33,907 --> 01:04:36,197
Devotees come not only come from West Bengal

1100
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:39,617
but in thousands from the areas around
for these celebrations

1101
01:04:39,907 --> 01:04:43,618
West Bengal Government has made all arrangements
for the comfort of devotees

1102
01:04:43,908 --> 01:04:45,658
One thousand Police are put on security
and RTC is running 100 special busses

1103
01:04:45,788 --> 01:04:47,578
Oh! my God.

1104
01:04:47,748 --> 01:04:50,158
Baburao, is the phone connected?
It is not connecting sir, I am trying.

1105
01:04:50,198 --> 01:04:50,948
Come on try

1106
01:04:50,998 --> 01:04:53,699
Guest houses are decorated beautifully for the devotees

1107
01:04:53,999 --> 01:04:56,619
All streets of Darjeeling are crowded with the devotees

1108
01:04:56,749 --> 01:04:58,249
Hail Goddess

1109
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:01,869
Hey idiot..Phone is ringing in the pocket, lift it

1110
01:05:02,449 --> 01:05:03,539
He may be some debtor

1111
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:05,000
He is not lifting the phone

1112
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,080
Call that Raja..

1113
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,120
Here is the offering, touch to the eyes and eat.
Shut up bloody

1114
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,830
IG calling...

1115
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,200
Why did he call at this time?

1116
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:14,951
Say IG sir

1117
01:05:15,081 --> 01:05:18,041
Lucky is seen live in that NTV camera, go and see

1118
01:05:18,751 --> 01:05:19,201
Is it?

1119
01:05:19,251 --> 01:05:20,751
Hey Bujji, it seems our lucky is being seen in the TV

1120
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:21,871
There she is, move
Move

1121
01:05:22,081 --> 01:05:24,001
Come on fast..I am saying right!

1122
01:05:26,872 --> 01:05:28,792
Hey, move away from TV.

1123
01:05:30,122 --> 01:05:30,752
Move...

1124
01:05:32,252 --> 01:05:35,543
Do something and make that girl not seen in TV

1125
01:05:35,623 --> 01:05:36,703
Hey, where are the camera guys?

1126
01:05:36,753 --> 01:05:37,503
Here

1127
01:05:38,203 --> 01:05:39,333
Baba is there that side..
Hey go.

1128
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:41,623
Hey, Katrina Kaif came to visit the God.
Wow Katrina Kaif!?

1129
01:05:41,663 --> 01:05:43,623
There, come I will show
Hey wait..

1130
01:05:48,704 --> 01:05:49,874
She is Katrina Kaif

1131
01:05:52,374 --> 01:05:54,914
Your name...
Katrina Kaif

1132
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:07,506
Grand party to all of you on the occasion of my
tea estate opening grandly

1133
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:09,296
Cheers..
Cheers.

1134
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:12,626
Our bank loan for Tea estate is 50 lakhs.
Where did you get so much money?

1135
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:14,626
I put a hole to your bank

1136
01:06:15,336 --> 01:06:16,046
What?

1137
01:06:16,126 --> 01:06:17,456
Yes, it is a joke

1138
01:06:17,546 --> 01:06:19,297
What are you here?
No idea sir, I cannot see

1139
01:06:19,417 --> 01:06:20,757
You idiot, again the same loop?

1140
01:06:21,417 --> 01:06:22,297
Prasad...

1141
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:26,337
In which flight did Lord Hanuman travel to Lanka?

1142
01:06:26,757 --> 01:06:27,667
He went in Indigo.

1143
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,588
What is Hanuman going in flight, you mad old?

1144
01:06:30,918 --> 01:06:31,918
Wrong answer

1145
01:06:34,878 --> 01:06:37,088
Oh no, is she really mad?

1146
01:06:37,168 --> 01:06:38,258
Yes

1147
01:06:38,588 --> 01:06:40,509
Hey Bujji, he would never do fraud again

1148
01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:42,419
Uncle and family are very happy Raja.

1149
01:06:42,669 --> 01:06:43,549
Thank you so much

1150
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:45,049
When will you be happy Lucky?

1151
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,549
It is time to start a new life Lucky

1152
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:52,800
God gave wings even to human
along with the birds, Lucky

1153
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:55,420
We forget to be having those because of our sorrows

1154
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:58,300
Just fly once and see Lucky, you will know what life is

1155
01:07:03,171 --> 01:07:07,051
Allabe allabe

1156
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:11,842
Allabe allabe

1157
01:07:23,883 --> 01:07:30,423
Allabe allabe, I am the Charlie Chaplin

1158
01:07:30,763 --> 01:07:36,844
Allabe... Will I not be your eyes
and present so many smiles

1159
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:41,594
Shall I forget all festivals, who is more than you?

1160
01:08:23,218 --> 01:08:27,679
Life is a lovely jasmine
and the wind and cyclone are natural

1161
01:08:27,849 --> 01:08:32,139
Bear the sorrow like the flower not frightened

1162
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:41,310
Yesterday is not like the day before
and no tomorrow comes like today

1163
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:45,640
Every day is a new life,
come on learn as you cannot escape

1164
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:50,181
Story does not run in the direction you dream

1165
01:08:50,221 --> 01:08:54,971
Will small disturbances
and pain not come in the calculation of life?

1166
01:09:06,682 --> 01:09:08,773
Allabe allabe..

1167
01:09:09,023 --> 01:09:13,353
Allabe allabe, I am the Charlie Chaplin

1168
01:09:13,643 --> 01:09:19,854
Allabe... Will I not be your eyes
and present so many smiles

1169
01:09:19,934 --> 01:09:24,774
Shall I forget all festivals, who is more than you?

1170
01:10:03,978 --> 01:10:07,778
Not wanting the life without dad,
I waited as to when he would kill

1171
01:10:08,478 --> 01:10:10,938
Raja, I want to live

1172
01:10:13,149 --> 01:10:15,479
I want to live whole life with the same happiness

1173
01:10:17,189 --> 01:10:20,649
I want to know the ambition my dad left for me

1174
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:26,650
You said that life does not come and give anything
but we should go ahead and take

1175
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:29,400
I want to go ahead.

1176
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:33,281
I want to live

1177
01:10:46,782 --> 01:10:48,192
Why are you hitting our own guy?

1178
01:10:49,482 --> 01:10:51,692
He is not our guy, but a Police informer

1179
01:10:54,983 --> 01:10:56,443
Looking at his phone call data,

1180
01:10:56,573 --> 01:11:00,483
he spoke once to his wife
and once an hour to Police in a day

1181
01:11:05,484 --> 01:11:05,944
Daddy,

1182
01:11:06,944 --> 01:11:07,944
where did you find him?

1183
01:11:08,114 --> 01:11:15,735
Recently when notes were banned, he taught me
Pay TM to pay at toll gates, milk and to pay bills

1184
01:11:15,825 --> 01:11:19,155
As he helped you in Pay Tm,
you pushed him into my team

1185
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:25,155
Why did you kill him so without knowing
whereabouts of the girl?

1186
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:28,486
I am not an idiot like you, he already gave us a clue

1187
01:11:28,696 --> 01:11:32,156
Last week Sunday morning, when
I was watching NTV he stood blocking the TV.

1188
01:11:32,196 --> 01:11:34,236
There would definitely be some information
we need in that

1189
01:11:34,366 --> 01:11:36,827
I immediately want that NTV footage right now

1190
01:11:36,987 --> 01:11:39,947
I will speak with NTV head on phone,
you urgently go to Hyderabad and get that footage

1191
01:11:40,077 --> 01:11:41,657
Why to run to Hyderabad for that?

1192
01:11:41,787 --> 01:11:45,237
These days, they keep all programs coming on
TV in YouTube right? That is all.

1193
01:11:46,697 --> 01:11:47,538
Oh no..

1194
01:11:52,198 --> 01:11:53,038
Hey Police,

1195
01:11:53,118 --> 01:11:57,788
you planned a man in my team without my knowledge
and diverted me not to get information of that girl.

1196
01:11:58,199 --> 01:12:00,289
But, now I came to know where she is

1197
01:12:01,409 --> 01:12:02,829
My men are starting.

1198
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:05,039
Save her how you can

1199
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,080
Sorry Lucky I hid a truth from you.

1200
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:20,911
These are none other than the Police
we appointed to save you.

1201
01:12:24,241 --> 01:12:25,911
Devaraj came to know that you are here.

1202
01:12:26,201 --> 01:12:27,451
He may come anytime

1203
01:12:27,741 --> 01:12:29,952
Your Visa is ready,
you should immediately start abroad

1204
01:12:30,242 --> 01:12:32,412
Do not run sir, let us fight

1205
01:12:36,742 --> 01:12:38,742
I am talking right? Why are you coming in the middle?

1206
01:12:39,332 --> 01:12:41,583
Be silent.
Lucky let's go..

1207
01:12:42,493 --> 01:12:44,373
Do not run sir, let us fight

1208
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:49,123
It was because of him that he came
to know that this girl is here Sir

1209
01:12:49,413 --> 01:12:51,454
Though I said no, he took her out

1210
01:12:51,624 --> 01:12:53,624
Do not run sir, let us fight

1211
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:02,455
You came here as your mom begged,
why are you overacting?

1212
01:13:03,495 --> 01:13:05,545
Hey, pull him out from here

1213
01:13:07,295 --> 01:13:07,705
Move

1214
01:13:11,665 --> 01:13:12,746
Sir...

1215
01:13:29,747 --> 01:13:31,047
Start the jeep..
Thankyou sir.

1216
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:10,461
Boys..

1217
01:14:34,343 --> 01:14:34,923
Move..

1218
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:39,554
Come on Lucky..

1219
01:14:43,304 --> 01:14:45,094
Fast... Let us go

1220
01:15:08,506 --> 01:15:10,217
Lucky..Go.

1221
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,677
Lucky..Go.

1222
01:15:16,467 --> 01:15:19,097
Do not run sir, let us fight

1223
01:16:02,562 --> 01:16:05,972
Lucky, do not run let us fight

1224
01:16:12,142 --> 01:16:13,223
Blind..

1225
01:16:40,975 --> 01:16:41,725
Go man..

1226
01:16:58,977 --> 01:17:01,567
My son may not see this world,

1227
01:17:01,897 --> 01:17:04,357
but this world should see what my son is

1228
01:17:12,268 --> 01:17:13,768
What is your strongest weapon?

1229
01:17:14,438 --> 01:17:15,148
My body

1230
01:17:16,728 --> 01:17:19,769
What is the most powerful thing in your body?
My brain

1231
01:17:22,189 --> 01:17:24,069
What is the thing you do not in your body?

1232
01:17:24,269 --> 01:17:25,069
My eyes

1233
01:18:06,733 --> 01:18:08,073
I am blind

1234
01:18:13,404 --> 01:18:14,734
But, I am trained

1235
01:18:32,656 --> 01:18:33,696
Confuse and hit him

1236
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:23,200
Anybody else?

1237
01:19:55,283 --> 01:19:56,494
Say him

1238
01:19:58,744 --> 01:20:00,454
I am in front of Lucky

1239
01:20:03,954 --> 01:20:06,584
Whoever comes or how many ever come...
Hey, all left

1240
01:20:06,784 --> 01:20:07,705
You should say right Bujji?

1241
01:20:07,785 --> 01:20:08,915
I extended a bit as the flow was good

1242
01:20:08,995 --> 01:20:10,875
Ok, where is IG sir?
There he is, come I will take

1243
01:20:13,085 --> 01:20:14,785
IG sir, come. We shall sip tea and talk

1244
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:17,035
How if you keep running away for everything IG sir?

1245
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:18,786
They will set if we hit them slightly

1246
01:20:18,956 --> 01:20:20,286
Of course, it is not that you know.

1247
01:20:20,336 --> 01:20:21,456
There will be a ditch ahead, take care

1248
01:20:22,706 --> 01:20:24,666
Please come and be seated. Sit

1249
01:20:25,456 --> 01:20:29,377
Hey Bujji, looks like IG sir is in tension,
Say a Darjeeling special tea

1250
01:20:30,877 --> 01:20:31,957
Bujji
Yes

1251
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:33,627
What are the facial expressions of the audience?

1252
01:20:34,127 --> 01:20:36,537
It is glowing in between happiness and surprise

1253
01:20:37,747 --> 01:20:39,128
It is break time

1254
01:20:59,809 --> 01:21:03,810
Did a blind hit 30 people with good sight?

1255
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:07,190
Will my son believe saying this fact now?

1256
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,941
Sir, do not hit sir

1257
01:21:11,231 --> 01:21:12,231
Oh no, son has come

1258
01:21:12,271 --> 01:21:13,141
Sir, do not hit sir

1259
01:21:13,311 --> 01:21:15,191
Sir, do not hit sir

1260
01:21:15,311 --> 01:21:16,391
Sir..

1261
01:21:16,481 --> 01:21:17,891
Why are you hitting son?

1262
01:21:18,481 --> 01:21:21,732
Look dad, it seems this blind
has drawn this painting.

1263
01:21:21,852 --> 01:21:24,192
When I asked to call a painter
to draw picture of brother...

1264
01:21:24,642 --> 01:21:26,482
How will a blind draw this painting?

1265
01:21:28,022 --> 01:21:32,143
I will pluck your eyes if you come
into this compound again with such crazy ideas

1266
01:21:34,523 --> 01:21:36,393
some day you will get to know their power

1267
01:21:36,443 --> 01:21:37,483
Get out
Move on

1268
01:21:38,563 --> 01:21:40,643
Oh funny! Ok, where is the girl guys?

1269
01:21:42,443 --> 01:21:44,194
Did a blind hit you guys too or what?

1270
01:21:46,064 --> 01:21:47,274
Where is the girl?

1271
01:21:47,524 --> 01:21:52,694
You either hit with a belt or chop with a knife,
a blind has hit these guys

1272
01:22:04,196 --> 01:22:07,106
Lucky, he would raise more knowing
that we hit his men.

1273
01:22:07,276 --> 01:22:09,026
Listen to me at least now and leave abroad

1274
01:22:10,276 --> 01:22:12,196
Do not run uncle, let us fight

1275
01:22:17,897 --> 01:22:20,987
Every year I used to travel to my village
for my birthday along with my dad

1276
01:22:21,277 --> 01:22:26,398
I need to know the ambition my dad left for me uncle
and thus I should go even this time.

1277
01:22:28,488 --> 01:22:31,448
I do not need anybody uncle.
Just send only Raja and it is enough

1278
01:22:37,149 --> 01:22:39,899
Hey Bujji, what is the facial expression of IG sir

1279
01:22:39,949 --> 01:22:42,739
It is getting pestering in between
helplessness and disappointment

1280
01:22:43,069 --> 01:22:45,899
Yes, it is laughing time with less sound

1281
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:50,780
Raja..
Sir.

1282
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:54,110
Hey, that is my leg

1283
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:55,240
Sorry sir, I thought it is a pole

1284
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,700
Go along with Lucky to village and
Ok, after going...

1285
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:58,861
Safeguard her
My mom said that long back, right?

1286
01:22:59,151 --> 01:23:01,951
Say your password
Hey, that is my phone

1287
01:23:02,031 --> 01:23:03,991
Why not we clear the guy who is the real problem?

1288
01:23:04,071 --> 01:23:05,781
Ok Google call Deva

1289
01:23:07,902 --> 01:23:08,492
Hello

1290
01:23:09,112 --> 01:23:11,282
Your men would have already said you about me

1291
01:23:11,452 --> 01:23:12,702
You may have taken it light.

1292
01:23:13,362 --> 01:23:14,782
Consider me

1293
01:23:16,152 --> 01:23:17,112
Who are you, idiot?

1294
01:23:17,402 --> 01:23:18,653
Raja the great

1295
01:23:21,113 --> 01:23:23,203
In general the guy with sight will have a dirty disease

1296
01:23:23,573 --> 01:23:24,703
They do not listen to anything when said.

1297
01:23:25,073 --> 01:23:26,113
They do not believe unless they see

1298
01:23:27,533 --> 01:23:29,654
I am starting with Lucky to her village.

1299
01:23:30,034 --> 01:23:32,244
Come on, come and be heard

1300
01:23:35,364 --> 01:23:36,784
Consider me

1301
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:41,865
Daddy, what you said is correct.

1302
01:23:42,655 --> 01:23:45,115
It seems that blind fellow is taking
that girl to her village

1303
01:23:45,825 --> 01:23:47,865
He challenged me to come there.

1304
01:23:48,575 --> 01:23:49,615
Should I go or not?

1305
01:23:49,825 --> 01:23:51,826
As per my idea, it is better you go son

1306
01:23:52,156 --> 01:23:55,076
Should I go when after all a blind guy challenges?

1307
01:23:55,996 --> 01:23:56,956
Should I go?

1308
01:23:59,656 --> 01:24:01,157
Bless me daddy
Mercy of the Goddess

1309
01:24:01,577 --> 01:24:04,617
I have meeting with CM in two days
and he is confirming the ticket

1310
01:24:04,907 --> 01:24:05,367
Good

1311
01:24:05,577 --> 01:24:10,157
Daddy, is it difficult to take the life of a girl
or to get a post like this?

1312
01:24:10,207 --> 01:24:13,328
That is girl and post...
Difficult to get the post

1313
01:24:13,458 --> 01:24:14,288
Yes, it sounds so

1314
01:24:14,538 --> 01:24:15,828
Uncle is there in that area right?

1315
01:24:15,998 --> 01:24:18,908
Call him and ask him to beat that blind
and bring the girl

1316
01:24:19,118 --> 01:24:21,498
Do not bring down my range for every small matter

1317
01:24:22,829 --> 01:24:24,959
I am a wonder. Wonder!

1318
01:24:30,829 --> 01:24:32,910
Good morning brother
Good morning big brother

1319
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:33,710
Coffee

1320
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,290
Where is the respect adjacent to Coffee?

1321
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:37,250
Coffee hubby

1322
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:38,710
You should have that clarity before

1323
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:39,330
Milk hubby..

1324
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:41,410
Why are you hitting me hubby?

1325
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:42,870
Will sister in law not feel if she is beaten alone?

1326
01:24:43,461 --> 01:24:46,001
Good morning brother
Good morning brothers

1327
01:24:47,661 --> 01:24:48,331
Good morning

1328
01:24:48,961 --> 01:24:51,001
Why not call when beside hubby?
That is a fun

1329
01:24:51,501 --> 01:24:54,122
What kick would be there without
that fun early in the morning?

1330
01:24:54,372 --> 01:24:55,212
Hey

1331
01:24:58,832 --> 01:25:00,542
Elders are waiting outside daddy?
Why?

1332
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:03,462
Dad, today is Sunday right? We will go to a movie.

1333
01:25:03,792 --> 01:25:07,083
Movie rascals...

1334
01:25:07,293 --> 01:25:09,293
Why do you hit like a rascal
when asked to go for a movie?

1335
01:25:09,373 --> 01:25:11,123
Hey, she scolded something

1336
01:25:11,163 --> 01:25:12,583
What did I say? I did not say anything.
Hey, what did you say?

1337
01:25:12,623 --> 01:25:15,164
Hey, stop
Go inside...

1338
01:25:15,214 --> 01:25:16,714
She said something like rascal

1339
01:25:16,754 --> 01:25:17,964
Did she say?
That is very bad word

1340
01:25:18,164 --> 01:25:19,584
How many more days with these idiots, sister?

1341
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:21,164
No way out, for the kids dear

1342
01:25:21,874 --> 01:25:22,874
Idiots will be out soon

1343
01:25:23,754 --> 01:25:26,005
What elders, came in a group?

1344
01:25:26,165 --> 01:25:29,465
Celebration in the village used
to happen every year on the hands of your brother

1345
01:25:29,755 --> 01:25:30,755
He is no more now

1346
01:25:31,005 --> 01:25:34,045
and we felt it goes good if celebration
happens on your hands now

1347
01:25:34,085 --> 01:25:35,625
How much would brother give for the celebration?

1348
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:37,756
He used to give 4 lakhs every year sir

1349
01:25:37,916 --> 01:25:40,716
We will give 8. What brothers?
We shall give if needed brother

1350
01:25:40,756 --> 01:25:41,756
Come forward, dear elders

1351
01:25:42,506 --> 01:25:44,006
Come, stand in front.
Come

1352
01:25:44,126 --> 01:25:46,666
One lakh and one...
One lakh and two...

1353
01:25:46,876 --> 01:25:49,417
You are enjoying property taking in wrong way
and do you not help for a good cause?

1354
01:25:49,467 --> 01:25:50,167
Are you humans?

1355
01:25:50,377 --> 01:25:53,377
Bro, priest is feeling bad as all are given
and he did not get

1356
01:25:53,417 --> 01:25:55,377
Then we shall give 16 to the priest, bring him

1357
01:25:55,417 --> 01:25:56,047
Come on

1358
01:25:56,337 --> 01:25:59,468
Hey no...
Come on

1359
01:25:59,548 --> 01:26:01,298
Come on hit..

1360
01:26:01,338 --> 01:26:02,508
Oh no..

1361
01:26:02,968 --> 01:26:05,838
Hey, do you manhandle this great Brahmin?

1362
01:26:05,968 --> 01:26:07,258
I have moles on my tongue.

1363
01:26:07,338 --> 01:26:10,049
I will sit in front of your door till
I see you get ruined.

1364
01:26:15,339 --> 01:26:18,219
I will tie this hair only when my revenge is achieved

1365
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:23,260
A man to suppress your ego will come.

1366
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:25,130
He will come

1367
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:26,800
He will come

1368
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:30,551
Someone here is strongly wishing for our entry Bujji

1369
01:26:35,801 --> 01:26:37,471
Brother, look there..

1370
01:26:45,092 --> 01:26:46,842
Why did the girl thought to have gone come like this?

1371
01:26:49,472 --> 01:26:50,472
Are you fine uncle?

1372
01:26:50,512 --> 01:26:52,133
We thought you too were gone along with your dad.

1373
01:26:52,303 --> 01:26:53,423
Why did you come back like this again?

1374
01:26:56,973 --> 01:26:59,883
We do the celebration in our village
temple every year, right uncle?

1375
01:27:00,263 --> 01:27:01,093
That is why I...

1376
01:27:01,173 --> 01:27:03,424
There are no such bad things this year. Leave now

1377
01:27:07,094 --> 01:27:08,174
Poor girl, let her be...

1378
01:27:10,014 --> 01:27:11,424
Where is the respect before that?

1379
01:27:11,554 --> 01:27:12,475
Poor girl hubby

1380
01:27:12,515 --> 01:27:13,595
That clarity should have been there before

1381
01:27:13,885 --> 01:27:15,425
Why are you still standing, get out

1382
01:27:16,805 --> 01:27:18,885
Bujji, what are the facial expressions of these idiots?

1383
01:27:19,345 --> 01:27:21,975
It is a mix of cruelty and ruggedness

1384
01:27:22,135 --> 01:27:24,056
I did not like it

1385
01:27:25,386 --> 01:27:26,136
What is that sir?

1386
01:27:26,596 --> 01:27:30,806
Instead of taking Lucky coming home
after so long inside, why do you ask to leave?

1387
01:27:31,136 --> 01:27:32,976
No, I did not like your behaviour at all

1388
01:27:34,057 --> 01:27:35,227
What is you to like, idiot?

1389
01:27:35,307 --> 01:27:36,847
Your head will break in a single shot

1390
01:27:36,887 --> 01:27:38,307
I will squeeze like a lemon.

1391
01:27:38,347 --> 01:27:40,057
We will throw you into the air and chop

1392
01:27:40,307 --> 01:27:42,637
Dear blind man, we too are blind like you

1393
01:27:42,847 --> 01:27:44,678
We cannot see these love and affections.

1394
01:27:44,888 --> 01:27:45,888
Please leave from here

1395
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:48,728
Sir, I got fruits from the garden.
Shall I cut and serve them to the kids?

1396
01:27:48,808 --> 01:27:50,478
Is it the occasion, you idiot?

1397
01:27:51,428 --> 01:27:52,058
Bujji

1398
01:27:59,929 --> 01:28:02,519
Will they cut the melon like this
and that too in the air?

1399
01:28:02,769 --> 01:28:06,060
Melon is ok brother, but what is even a grape?

1400
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:09,520
Subhadra...Take Lucky in for now, immediately

1401
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:11,100
Come dear.

1402
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,730
Hey Pineapple... I like it
Thank you uncle

1403
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,521
I systematically threatened as you are relatives.

1404
01:28:17,931 --> 01:28:19,351
Lucky should not have anything in less

1405
01:28:19,891 --> 01:28:21,931
Do the arrangements perfectly for the celebration

1406
01:28:22,681 --> 01:28:24,271
Bujji
Move

1407
01:28:27,142 --> 01:28:28,562
This is just beginning

1408
01:28:48,854 --> 01:28:51,814
Aunty, there was photo of dad here right?

1409
01:28:52,104 --> 01:28:53,984
Those idiots removed and threw it in the store room

1410
01:28:56,604 --> 01:29:01,275
Either he is in this house or not,
I thought at least his remembrances would stand

1411
01:29:02,605 --> 01:29:03,395
Even those are not here

1412
01:29:09,066 --> 01:29:10,856
Ok Google, call Ananthalakshmi

1413
01:29:13,236 --> 01:29:13,986
Say Dear...

1414
01:29:14,146 --> 01:29:16,736
Ananthalakshmi, we came to the village of Lucky.

1415
01:29:16,936 --> 01:29:19,276
There are four idiots here
and it goes well setting them up.

1416
01:29:19,436 --> 01:29:20,687
Come on set them, go on

1417
01:29:30,107 --> 01:29:32,148
I should give a lakh for celebration to happen right now

1418
01:29:32,278 --> 01:29:33,858
You should give two
He should give three

1419
01:29:34,068 --> 01:29:36,238
Instead of giving so many, why not finish him brother?

1420
01:29:36,278 --> 01:29:36,938
Murder?

1421
01:29:38,068 --> 01:29:39,358
Where is the respect before murder?

1422
01:29:39,488 --> 01:29:40,188
Murder hubby?

1423
01:29:40,278 --> 01:29:41,319
You should have that clarity before

1424
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:43,739
Will sister in law not feel bad if she is alone hit?

1425
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:45,859
Goodnight

1426
01:29:46,489 --> 01:29:49,149
Should you hit and say that?
It is pure fun

1427
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:52,530
You are acting, right?

1428
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:55,990
You...

1429
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,190
Yes, come on say

1430
01:30:00,610 --> 01:30:03,111
Those four idiots are thinking to kill us

1431
01:30:03,901 --> 01:30:05,321
Ananthalakshmi, call you later

1432
01:30:08,491 --> 01:30:09,151
Bujji, position

1433
01:30:12,992 --> 01:30:14,742
Why they have slept without latching the door?

1434
01:30:14,782 --> 01:30:16,652
He cannot see, right?
Then move

1435
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:19,692
Hey...

1436
01:30:20,532 --> 01:30:21,152
Get up idiot

1437
01:30:30,943 --> 01:30:32,113
Come on catch

1438
01:30:34,364 --> 01:30:36,114
Hey wait.. Silence

1439
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:37,074
See now

1440
01:30:44,404 --> 01:30:44,945
I am sorry

1441
01:31:02,036 --> 01:31:04,246
Hey Bujji, someone came into our room

1442
01:31:05,696 --> 01:31:07,247
Who?
Maybe the thieves

1443
01:31:07,407 --> 01:31:09,117
You like killing thieves, right? Kill them

1444
01:31:10,787 --> 01:31:12,997
I will kill, I will chop, I will stab.

1445
01:31:13,197 --> 01:31:16,868
My sword...

1446
01:31:16,948 --> 01:31:18,828
Hey Bujji...They robbed my sword

1447
01:31:18,868 --> 01:31:20,538
There is the emergency kit under the cot, right? Use that

1448
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:21,658
Yes

1449
01:31:29,869 --> 01:31:32,289
Great warrior skills and the enemy troupe is ruined

1450
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:40,410
Bujji... Blood! There are thieves confirmedly

1451
01:31:40,910 --> 01:31:43,000
Oh..next item.

1452
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:49,501
Spear troupe... Arrow troupe... Skills of Raja
and punishment to the enemies... Sharp...

1453
01:31:51,791 --> 01:31:53,201
Let us take turn, about turn

1454
01:31:57,041 --> 01:31:59,082
Bujji!, why is there no single sound
even after hitting so many arrows?

1455
01:31:59,122 --> 01:32:01,042
Perfume and the huge fire volcano

1456
01:32:02,792 --> 01:32:03,582
What perfume brother?

1457
01:32:03,792 --> 01:32:05,002
What volcano brother?

1458
01:32:08,502 --> 01:32:11,003
Brothers, spray...

1459
01:32:11,583 --> 01:32:12,623
Jasmine flavor

1460
01:32:18,003 --> 01:32:18,663
Where the key.

1461
01:32:18,753 --> 01:32:19,833
Where is the key.
He is coming

1462
01:32:34,755 --> 01:32:37,005
Bujji, why is no sound coming even
when so much is done?

1463
01:32:37,415 --> 01:32:39,375
Kadapa bomb and goodbye with tears

1464
01:32:40,755 --> 01:32:41,165
Come on throw..

1465
01:32:45,586 --> 01:32:46,586
Will you kill or what?

1466
01:32:47,586 --> 01:32:49,916
They call Police when thieves enter the house

1467
01:32:50,256 --> 01:32:52,257
They would beat badly if caught.

1468
01:32:52,547 --> 01:32:55,337
What is this, you are almost killing?

1469
01:32:55,417 --> 01:32:56,877
Why did you come sir?

1470
01:32:56,917 --> 01:32:59,917
They said like guest is equal to God, right?
We came to do service

1471
01:33:00,167 --> 01:33:01,417
Why not tell that before itself?

1472
01:33:01,587 --> 01:33:04,168
Did you give any gap and let us say it out?

1473
01:33:04,418 --> 01:33:06,628
Hey Bujji, we played with our
people thinking as the thieves

1474
01:33:06,668 --> 01:33:08,628
You may have played,
but no single target is missed out

1475
01:33:08,668 --> 01:33:09,708
Why so late..let's start..

1476
01:33:09,958 --> 01:33:13,799
In the hut.. in the hut.

1477
01:33:15,509 --> 01:33:16,759
Prayer has done..
Good night.

1478
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:17,839
Which country song was this

1479
01:33:17,879 --> 01:33:19,049
I will ask them brother
Brother..

1480
01:33:20,709 --> 01:33:21,839
Come on move..

1481
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:29,340
Hey, it did not end with this. There is still left

1482
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,090
He looks not to go home unless he ruins us

1483
01:33:35,301 --> 01:33:37,671
Sister, what is in that bag?
Thank you

1484
01:33:37,841 --> 01:33:39,671
Sister, please I want this

1485
01:33:39,841 --> 01:33:40,301
Aunty..

1486
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:40,921
Oh no!

1487
01:33:41,461 --> 01:33:42,211
Oh no!

1488
01:33:46,462 --> 01:33:48,632
What is happening here?
Daddy

1489
01:33:49,212 --> 01:33:51,382
Daddy, sister brought gifts for us.

1490
01:33:54,012 --> 01:33:54,552
Uncle..

1491
01:33:56,883 --> 01:34:00,173
You do not bring and do not let us
take when someone brings like a rascal

1492
01:34:00,263 --> 01:34:02,133
Oh no, she scolded bad again
What did you say?

1493
01:34:02,343 --> 01:34:03,423
What did I say? I did not say anything

1494
01:34:03,463 --> 01:34:04,263
Move aside

1495
01:34:04,633 --> 01:34:06,594
Did you think to settle here by giving all these?

1496
01:34:06,634 --> 01:34:07,674
No, not that uncle

1497
01:34:07,714 --> 01:34:09,514
You should have some shame
to stay back even when asked to get out

1498
01:34:11,634 --> 01:34:13,214
Bujji, what is the discussion?

1499
01:34:13,264 --> 01:34:13,844
Tell what is that?

1500
01:34:14,214 --> 01:34:15,804
Oh no brother, what is he coming with the kit?

1501
01:34:15,924 --> 01:34:18,095
Good morning everybody, what is happening here?

1502
01:34:18,175 --> 01:34:22,095
As baby brought gifts for kids,
I am saying they are very good

1503
01:34:22,175 --> 01:34:25,465
It is a lie. They are hitting as we took the toys.

1504
01:34:25,635 --> 01:34:26,215
Yes.

1505
01:34:26,385 --> 01:34:29,016
Not just us, but they daily hit our moms too.
Dirty rascals

1506
01:34:29,056 --> 01:34:30,846
She scolded again, she said rascals

1507
01:34:30,926 --> 01:34:32,016
Did she really scold?
Yes, she said rascals

1508
01:34:32,216 --> 01:34:35,596
Lucky, you go inside dear
Not that Raja

1509
01:34:35,716 --> 01:34:36,966
Bujji
Yes, one minute

1510
01:34:37,176 --> 01:34:38,767
Lucky... You come

1511
01:34:39,267 --> 01:34:39,927
Go..

1512
01:34:40,557 --> 01:34:44,267
I am finally asking, are you doing
arrangements for the celebrations or not?

1513
01:34:44,347 --> 01:34:45,267
We do not have money

1514
01:34:46,177 --> 01:34:49,518
Ok, shall we play with this kit for some time?

1515
01:34:49,928 --> 01:34:52,308
What with kit every time? Say some new game

1516
01:34:52,468 --> 01:34:53,468
I will give another option.

1517
01:34:53,808 --> 01:34:57,098
You in the places of your wives
and they in your place for an hour...

1518
01:34:57,518 --> 01:34:59,598
What is that game?
That is the game

1519
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:00,719
It's a fun game.

1520
01:35:00,809 --> 01:35:02,639
Brother, look at those faces

1521
01:35:03,219 --> 01:35:06,219
Oh no, with our hands?

1522
01:35:07,309 --> 01:35:10,179
Pressed insects, dead snakes,
Rabits from hitchan

1523
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:12,140
Yes..this game is better for us.

1524
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,600
This game is ok for us

1525
01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:18,310
Ladies, this is a golden chance for you

1526
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:22,431
Like the male society shakes at once,

1527
01:35:24,601 --> 01:35:26,721
like the women society get into peace...

1528
01:35:30,851 --> 01:35:31,972
Come on, rise up

1529
01:35:33,722 --> 01:35:34,932
What is the time?
10

1530
01:35:36,142 --> 01:35:37,772
Where is respect beside the time?

1531
01:35:39,722 --> 01:35:40,522
10 madam

1532
01:35:41,022 --> 01:35:41,562
Oh no..

1533
01:35:42,183 --> 01:35:44,063
You should have that clarity before itself

1534
01:35:44,433 --> 01:35:45,683
Oh no..

1535
01:35:45,773 --> 01:35:48,723
Why do you hit me?
Will brother in law not feel if he is beaten alone?

1536
01:35:48,813 --> 01:35:50,143
You Bloody..

1537
01:35:54,814 --> 01:35:55,854
What, are you smoking?

1538
01:35:55,894 --> 01:35:57,144
It is fun... Come on give

1539
01:35:57,524 --> 01:35:58,024
Give it.

1540
01:35:58,394 --> 01:35:59,774
Oh no..

1541
01:36:01,394 --> 01:36:02,104
Hey..

1542
01:36:07,395 --> 01:36:11,525
Attention please....
This song is dedicated to all frustrated women

1543
01:36:13,355 --> 01:36:18,396
Hey beautiful lady... baby, come to the mango garden

1544
01:36:19,356 --> 01:36:24,566
Come on tighten up your dress baby,
all should be bashed

1545
01:36:25,357 --> 01:36:30,607
Hey beautiful lady...
baby, come to the mango garden

1546
01:36:30,857 --> 01:36:36,478
You showed taste of your cookery
Show the anger you have within to husband

1547
01:36:36,858 --> 01:36:39,528
They should go blank with your shots

1548
01:36:40,318 --> 01:36:44,728
Greatest of the games now...

1549
01:36:46,359 --> 01:36:50,729
Greatest of the games now...

1550
01:36:52,729 --> 01:36:54,149
Oh no...
No

1551
01:36:54,229 --> 01:36:54,779
Stop

1552
01:36:55,859 --> 01:36:58,690
You said an hour and the hand is on 10 from 5 hours.

1553
01:36:58,860 --> 01:36:59,860
Will that not move ahead?

1554
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:03,980
I removed the batteries uncle

1555
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:08,901
Greatest of the games now...

1556
01:37:10,361 --> 01:37:14,941
Greatest of the games now...

1557
01:37:16,691 --> 01:37:18,732
Once more

1558
01:37:19,232 --> 01:37:20,192
Again?

1559
01:37:20,282 --> 01:37:28,653
Hey beautiful lady...
baby, come to the mango garden

1560
01:37:29,443 --> 01:37:34,783
Hey beautiful lady...
baby, come to the mango garden

1561
01:37:35,653 --> 01:37:37,283
They are killing oh my God!

1562
01:37:38,113 --> 01:37:38,863
Hey Bujji!

1563
01:37:38,983 --> 01:37:41,364
They should give whatever is needed
for the celebration expenses

1564
01:37:44,324 --> 01:37:45,194
He signed

1565
01:37:45,284 --> 01:37:46,784
Yes.
Please smile

1566
01:37:46,864 --> 01:37:47,824
Laughs are not being heard

1567
01:37:59,155 --> 01:38:03,076
I will show you your life ambition,
when we come for this celebration next year

1568
01:38:26,738 --> 01:38:27,828
Someone came for Lucky

1569
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:36,159
Are you fine dear?

1570
01:38:36,409 --> 01:38:37,289
You are?

1571
01:38:37,619 --> 01:38:38,739
My name is Surya Murthy.

1572
01:38:39,329 --> 01:38:40,789
I know your father very well.

1573
01:38:42,369 --> 01:38:44,290
Do you know what the surprise
he said to give you was?

1574
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:47,830
Did you recognize this girl?

1575
01:39:09,042 --> 01:39:09,542
Divya!

1576
01:39:18,543 --> 01:39:22,993
The small wish you asked your dad in
childhood changed the life of this girl

1577
01:39:25,243 --> 01:39:27,874
I have asked the God, She will study

1578
01:39:28,244 --> 01:39:29,624
I completed medicine

1579
01:39:33,414 --> 01:39:34,084
Congrats

1580
01:39:34,374 --> 01:39:36,625
But your wish did not just stop with this one girl

1581
01:39:40,625 --> 01:39:44,205
Every single birthday of yours changed
the future of every girl here,

1582
01:39:46,295 --> 01:39:47,496
I did B Tech sister

1583
01:39:47,706 --> 01:39:48,916
I did MBA sister

1584
01:39:48,996 --> 01:39:51,706
I did MCA
I did M.Tech

1585
01:39:51,746 --> 01:39:54,456
I did MSc
I did Law.

1586
01:39:55,336 --> 01:39:59,497
Your dad adopted all these
and got them educated through our foundation

1587
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:07,207
Your dad wished to continue the
good work which started because of you, with you

1588
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:10,168
But, it happened so by then

1589
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:39,130
Do not cry Lucky, we are all here for you.

1590
01:40:41,421 --> 01:40:44,211
Smile sister, you look very good when you smile

1591
01:40:48,671 --> 01:40:50,051
Happy Birthday sister

1592
01:40:50,091 --> 01:40:50,752
Thank you

1593
01:40:50,802 --> 01:40:52,462
Happy Birthday sister.
Thank you

1594
01:40:54,712 --> 01:40:55,382
Thank you

1595
01:40:57,172 --> 01:40:59,842
Your dad like this will always
be with you in your happiness.

1596
01:41:00,212 --> 01:41:01,253
Always be happy

1597
01:41:09,253 --> 01:41:11,133
I never expected to see this moment today.

1598
01:41:11,553 --> 01:41:12,924
I saw, because of you

1599
01:41:14,924 --> 01:41:18,844
I understood the life
I would lead next because of coming here

1600
01:41:19,254 --> 01:41:20,214
This too is because of you

1601
01:41:21,804 --> 01:41:23,215
I am very happy Raja,

1602
01:41:24,465 --> 01:41:25,135
because of you

1603
01:41:25,505 --> 01:41:26,555
Happy Birthday Lucky.

1604
01:41:28,755 --> 01:41:32,135
Uncle, Raja troubled you a lot for me.

1605
01:41:32,675 --> 01:41:34,346
I am saying sorry for him.

1606
01:41:35,176 --> 01:41:36,966
I will leave tomorrow after the celebration is over

1607
01:41:37,506 --> 01:41:40,756
I will now never come in the way of your
property and happiness,uncle

1608
01:41:49,597 --> 01:41:54,758
I and so many girls stood by the side of
Lucky without any relation.

1609
01:41:55,178 --> 01:41:57,928
Why did you having a blood relation go so far sir?

1610
01:41:59,808 --> 01:42:02,008
We need to spend for helping anyone.

1611
01:42:02,388 --> 01:42:05,309
Love is for free right? Why not show it sir?

1612
01:42:07,009 --> 01:42:09,099
We can live without eyes or dreams.

1613
01:42:09,639 --> 01:42:11,679
But it is difficult to live without a support.

1614
01:42:12,179 --> 01:42:14,559
Added for a girl to live is more difficult.

1615
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:18,600
Come on Bujji,

1616
01:42:18,810 --> 01:42:22,390
God did a great thing by not giving eyes.

1617
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:23,970
Not so great faces..move

1618
01:42:36,471 --> 01:42:42,062
Lucky, we shared blood of brother
and were born but could not share his greatness

1619
01:42:43,392 --> 01:42:46,602
We are all there for you from today, Lucky

1620
01:42:52,723 --> 01:42:53,853
Lucky look at you

1621
01:42:56,973 --> 01:42:57,853
Bujji
Yes

1622
01:42:57,934 --> 01:42:58,974
What are the facial expressions of this family?

1623
01:42:59,224 --> 01:43:01,474
They are shining in between love and affection

1624
01:43:01,684 --> 01:43:04,104
Yes... It is laughing time

1625
01:43:12,645 --> 01:43:15,015
Son, take this sacred water.
It is good for the eyes

1626
01:43:15,105 --> 01:43:15,645
I don't want..

1627
01:43:16,185 --> 01:43:18,315
Eyes are important among all organs

1628
01:43:18,395 --> 01:43:18,975
Shut up

1629
01:43:19,186 --> 01:43:21,146
I am living here without those eyes from 25 years.

1630
01:43:21,476 --> 01:43:22,606
Will you sell off all the other parts?

1631
01:43:23,316 --> 01:43:25,186
All organs are important

1632
01:43:26,436 --> 01:43:28,106
Hey..move.

1633
01:43:32,147 --> 01:43:32,977
Hey,

1634
01:43:33,937 --> 01:43:37,267
It seems a blind fellow has brought a girl.

1635
01:43:38,067 --> 01:43:41,318
He should bring that girl and handover to me.

1636
01:43:41,398 --> 01:43:45,018
Else, celebration will not take place here.

1637
01:43:45,228 --> 01:43:46,938
Bloodshed would take place

1638
01:43:46,978 --> 01:43:48,858
Girl will not come and the celebration will not stop.

1639
01:43:48,978 --> 01:43:50,688
I need bloodshed.

1640
01:43:51,569 --> 01:43:54,439
Lucky! Start the worship

1641
01:43:56,439 --> 01:43:58,769
Hey, how many are we?

1642
01:43:58,939 --> 01:43:59,899
20 Brother

1643
01:43:59,939 --> 01:44:01,229
10 Of you go

1644
01:44:01,519 --> 01:44:02,400
Stop

1645
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:10,860
I will turn that side and everything
should end by the time I turn this side.

1646
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:12,150
Go now

1647
01:44:13,231 --> 01:44:20,521
Hey, prepare great tea with ginger, elaichi and milk

1648
01:44:28,652 --> 01:44:30,822
Did he hit?
Yes brother

1649
01:44:33,613 --> 01:44:34,233
Come..

1650
01:44:39,733 --> 01:44:41,903
Why did you fall behind me?

1651
01:44:41,943 --> 01:44:43,733
You came to hit me right?
I should hit you

1652
01:44:44,113 --> 01:44:45,274
What is me hitting you?

1653
01:44:45,404 --> 01:44:48,824
We came to eat as they were serving
food in the temple.

1654
01:44:48,864 --> 01:44:51,824
The guy who came to hit you has just left.
Go now, go

1655
01:44:52,114 --> 01:44:53,864
I know your voice well, it is you

1656
01:44:57,275 --> 01:45:03,775
Come on man! The guy who came to hit
you was frightened and has just left

1657
01:45:03,985 --> 01:45:05,986
You have changed voice and are talking great.

1658
01:45:06,116 --> 01:45:08,656
Whatever tricks you play, I should hit you

1659
01:45:10,116 --> 01:45:10,576
Hello..

1660
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:14,946
Same result how many ever you send. Consider me...

1661
01:45:16,527 --> 01:45:19,617
People around us say that our bad time started.

1662
01:45:19,947 --> 01:45:20,947
We should get to know.

1663
01:45:24,157 --> 01:45:27,408
If we still cannot think, Nature will say

1664
01:45:29,578 --> 01:45:30,868
We should fix

1665
01:45:32,618 --> 01:45:34,738
Come and be heard to me once

1666
01:45:36,448 --> 01:45:37,699
Why do you leave when I am saying that CM sir is calling?

1667
01:45:37,739 --> 01:45:38,489
Hey, it seems CM is calling

1668
01:45:38,529 --> 01:45:39,029
Deva...

1669
01:45:39,619 --> 01:45:40,989
Hey listen, stop son

1670
01:45:43,449 --> 01:45:47,329
You said more than killing a girl
to get post is difficult, right son

1671
01:45:47,779 --> 01:45:49,120
Now, to take life is difficult

1672
01:46:35,994 --> 01:46:38,624
Hey, stop. you stop.

1673
01:46:41,995 --> 01:46:42,665
Leave me..

1674
01:46:46,165 --> 01:46:48,245
Who is that man saying to stop if she is taken?

1675
01:46:49,915 --> 01:46:52,206
Where is that blind fellow? Come out

1676
01:46:58,126 --> 01:46:59,876
Bhamchik, that fellow came

1677
01:47:00,166 --> 01:47:02,707
When did I say to come and when did he come?
Ask him wait for two minutes

1678
01:47:02,787 --> 01:47:03,997
No, that is...
Back off

1679
01:47:07,747 --> 01:47:09,837
He is eating country chicken
and is saying to wait for two minutes

1680
01:47:10,127 --> 01:47:10,707
Oh no..

1681
01:47:11,167 --> 01:47:15,918
Daddy, what is he saying me to wait?
And that too eating a country chicken?

1682
01:47:17,378 --> 01:47:18,788
Mercy of the Goddess

1683
01:47:51,591 --> 01:47:53,591
Is it you who called me?

1684
01:47:53,711 --> 01:47:55,632
Bujji, which side is Lucky on?
She is on that side only

1685
01:47:55,672 --> 01:47:56,542
She is on that side only

1686
01:47:56,792 --> 01:47:58,212
Was it you who called me?

1687
01:47:58,292 --> 01:48:00,092
Send Lucky this side

1688
01:48:05,712 --> 01:48:07,793
Lucky
Raja

1689
01:48:19,714 --> 01:48:24,214
Your boss himself heard me and travelled so long.
You should listen to my word, right?

1690
01:48:30,675 --> 01:48:33,755
Hey Bujji, this fellow grew his
body great with great muscles.

1691
01:48:33,845 --> 01:48:35,175
This idiot will withstand five to six shots

1692
01:48:37,545 --> 01:48:38,796
What is your problem, idiot?

1693
01:48:39,176 --> 01:48:41,386
Your brother did a mistake and her dad shot him.

1694
01:48:41,546 --> 01:48:43,716
It was duty, right? What is this discussion?

1695
01:48:44,546 --> 01:48:47,426
What are all these revenges?
Pack them and keep it aside

1696
01:48:48,136 --> 01:48:50,847
Lucky has a life, let her live

1697
01:48:52,597 --> 01:48:55,717
Lucky has a goal, let her win

1698
01:48:59,258 --> 01:49:02,008
I gave a word to Lucky that
I will clear out all the problems of her

1699
01:49:02,508 --> 01:49:04,678
Look once into the eyes of Lucky

1700
01:49:07,848 --> 01:49:11,139
You can see the confidence that nobody
can do anything to her, right?

1701
01:49:16,509 --> 01:49:16,969
Aravind.

1702
01:49:36,011 --> 01:49:38,971
I have not called you here
to know your strength

1703
01:49:43,012 --> 01:49:45,052
For you to know my strength

1704
01:49:54,513 --> 01:49:55,473
What is your courage?

1705
01:49:55,553 --> 01:49:57,933
Stupid question, I am my courage

1706
01:49:58,183 --> 01:50:00,553
Do you have no fear at all?
Intelligent question

1707
01:50:14,305 --> 01:50:15,895
Have you ever been to forest?

1708
01:50:16,225 --> 01:50:16,855
I had been

1709
01:50:16,975 --> 01:50:18,515
Have you seen the tiger there?

1710
01:50:18,895 --> 01:50:19,555
I saw

1711
01:50:19,685 --> 01:50:20,685
Did you get frightened?

1712
01:50:22,805 --> 01:50:26,436
You will get frightened
because tiger will be seen to you

1713
01:50:27,766 --> 01:50:29,056
I can't see.

1714
01:50:30,766 --> 01:50:34,686
Maybe you are tiger in your point of view,
but I cannot see

1715
01:50:36,227 --> 01:50:40,357
What do you I care about any number of men behind you?
I cannot see

1716
01:50:43,357 --> 01:50:46,648
I am living every second after I was born by fighting.

1717
01:50:46,858 --> 01:50:48,108
I am a warrior

1718
01:50:50,228 --> 01:50:53,148
I am ready to die even a hundred times to win.

1719
01:50:53,648 --> 01:50:57,309
But my victory would before that death,
every time I die

1720
01:50:59,559 --> 01:51:03,519
How many ever maybe the eyes watching me,
how many ever maybe coming towards me,

1721
01:51:03,689 --> 01:51:08,190
the step you take, the look you see, breathe you take...
Everything is under my control

1722
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:15,020
Who is the man to cross me and touch Lucky?

1723
01:51:26,401 --> 01:51:29,442
If anybody still wants to come can cross
the line and come

1724
01:51:30,312 --> 01:51:32,692
But be cautious, it is a deadline...

1725
01:51:32,732 --> 01:51:34,062
Dead Line...

1726
01:51:46,343 --> 01:51:47,553
Oh God!

1727
01:51:59,514 --> 01:52:02,885
We sat in hot Sun from three hours
and I am getting weak.

1728
01:52:03,135 --> 01:52:04,385
He has no eyes.

1729
01:52:05,055 --> 01:52:09,675
We have eyes and are going unconscious.
Come, let us go, son

1730
01:52:13,846 --> 01:52:17,766
Daddy, according to science when
a wonder takes place before our eyes,

1731
01:52:17,966 --> 01:52:20,716
brain goes into saturation state for 10 seconds.

1732
01:52:21,096 --> 01:52:24,467
It means going into an awestruck
state full of overwhelmed surprise

1733
01:52:26,637 --> 01:52:28,057
That fellow is a wonder daddy

1734
01:52:32,268 --> 01:52:33,468
He is a wonder

1735
01:52:35,598 --> 01:52:39,968
Come on, he is hitting with a perfect timing
whenever anyone is coming from any corner

1736
01:52:41,018 --> 01:52:46,599
Based on my voice, he judged my height,
calculated and kept the knife locating my neck

1737
01:52:48,019 --> 01:52:50,269
He is a wonder daddy, a wonder

1738
01:52:50,929 --> 01:52:55,520
According to God,
when God gives defect to an organ in human,

1739
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:59,890
it seems he gives double and triple
powers to the other items in the body

1740
01:53:00,930 --> 01:53:01,770
Mercy of the Goddess

1741
01:53:02,020 --> 01:53:04,311
I know how to off his power

1742
01:53:04,931 --> 01:53:08,601
He showed me what he was and
I will show him what this Deva is

1743
01:53:09,021 --> 01:53:09,641
I will show

1744
01:53:09,811 --> 01:53:11,221
He cannot see, right son?

1745
01:53:14,772 --> 01:53:17,772
He cannot see even if you see so in anger

1746
01:53:18,972 --> 01:53:19,932
Bless me daddy

1747
01:53:20,272 --> 01:53:23,222
Daddy, one thing I did not like

1748
01:53:23,682 --> 01:53:29,063
The confidence seen in her eyes that
a man is standing before her to save her,

1749
01:53:29,683 --> 01:53:31,813
I did not like that

1750
01:54:04,406 --> 01:54:10,987
I am liking myself,
I am loving myself after you came into me

1751
01:54:11,447 --> 01:54:17,947
I am giving myself to you and coming to you,
till you my heart is taking me

1752
01:54:18,028 --> 01:54:24,908
Happiness feels like another birth,
love came to me like you for me

1753
01:54:25,028 --> 01:54:32,119
Do not think I asked, make me stand beside you

1754
01:54:32,449 --> 01:54:39,029
I am liking myself,
I am loving myself after you came into me

1755
01:55:16,283 --> 01:55:19,083
Lucky, there is complete happiness
now in your music

1756
01:55:20,123 --> 01:55:26,954
Flowery garden is opened up in the cheeks

1757
01:55:27,124 --> 01:55:33,455
My age has recalled you in the hick ups

1758
01:55:33,785 --> 01:55:40,625
All feelings cannot be said like you understand

1759
01:55:40,745 --> 01:55:48,086
You understand
and come near from my dreams about you

1760
01:55:48,166 --> 01:55:54,707
I am liking myself,
I am loving myself after you came into me

1761
01:56:22,169 --> 01:56:28,960
Hey honey bee, this black boy is so naughty

1762
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:36,211
Hey honey bee, he stole sleep from your beautiful eyes

1763
01:56:36,921 --> 01:56:40,381
He poked with moustache and cheated

1764
01:56:40,631 --> 01:56:44,251
He hugged and gave a hot waist band

1765
01:56:44,341 --> 01:56:51,672
Hey honey bee, he stole sleep from your beautiful eyes

1766
01:57:21,255 --> 01:57:22,675
Lucky..

1767
01:57:24,755 --> 01:57:28,505
You said to take the girl crossing over you,
right idiot? I am taking now, come on...

1768
01:57:29,346 --> 01:57:31,216
Now take her crossing over me, idiot.

1769
01:57:31,346 --> 01:57:32,006
Come on

1770
01:57:39,006 --> 01:57:39,506
Come.

1771
01:57:43,887 --> 01:57:44,387
Come.

1772
01:57:53,758 --> 01:57:54,508
Mom...

1773
01:57:54,638 --> 01:57:57,388
Wow! Your senses are working so sharp

1774
01:57:57,718 --> 01:57:59,298
You identified mom by smile

1775
01:57:59,638 --> 01:58:00,468
Mind blowing

1776
01:58:04,049 --> 01:58:04,719
Mom..

1777
01:58:05,219 --> 01:58:07,509
I am putting a test for your senses and sharpness

1778
01:58:07,849 --> 01:58:09,259
Let's play the game

1779
01:58:11,009 --> 01:58:11,970
Aunty

1780
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:14,180
Mom..

1781
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:15,220
Mom..

1782
01:58:15,930 --> 01:58:17,680
Nerve of your mom's hand is cut.

1783
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:20,350
She will die in 20 minutes.

1784
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:22,180
Mom...

1785
01:58:22,220 --> 01:58:23,511
My men are taking her.

1786
01:58:23,681 --> 01:58:27,301
Save if you can before blood drains out of her body

1787
01:58:27,431 --> 01:58:31,181
Decide now whether you want mom or the girl

1788
01:58:56,224 --> 01:58:57,934
Uncle.. here the stick.

1789
01:58:58,264 --> 01:58:58,854
Thanks.

1790
01:59:08,555 --> 01:59:10,555
Now the time is 3.10

1791
01:59:10,855 --> 01:59:12,055
20 minutes..

1792
01:59:12,305 --> 01:59:13,055
I want to save my mother

1793
01:59:51,769 --> 01:59:53,229
Hey..stop.. Where do you go?

1794
01:59:53,309 --> 01:59:54,229
Where is the next junction?

1795
01:59:54,359 --> 01:59:55,309
Palvancha cross junction

1796
01:59:55,479 --> 01:59:56,689
15 minutes from here

1797
01:59:57,059 --> 01:59:58,440
The time is 03.15

1798
01:59:58,610 --> 02:00:00,520
15 minutes...

1799
02:00:11,361 --> 02:00:14,111
Okay Google..now get to Palvancha cross junction

1800
02:00:15,561 --> 02:00:18,111
Navigating to Palvancha cross junction

1801

10 feet

1811
02:01:53,410 --> 02:01:54,320
Hey..take a turn

1812
02:02:14,202 --> 02:02:14,662
Mom.

1813
02:02:16,953 --> 02:02:17,413
Mom.

1814
02:02:20,123 --> 02:02:20,573
Mom.

1815
02:02:24,663 --> 02:02:25,123
Mom.

1816
02:02:26,914 --> 02:02:27,374
Mom.

1817
02:02:29,414 --> 02:02:30,244
Mom.

1818
02:02:33,874 --> 02:02:34,324
Mom.

1819
02:02:35,994 --> 02:02:36,664
Mom.

1820
02:02:41,575 --> 02:02:42,455
Mom.

1821
02:02:45,325 --> 02:02:45,785
Mom.

1822
02:02:47,825 --> 02:02:48,576
Mom.

1823
02:02:49,666 --> 02:02:50,286
Mom.

1824
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:37,830
Mom.

1825
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:40,170
Mom.

1826
02:03:58,922 --> 02:04:00,132
Condition is normal

1827
02:04:00,172 --> 02:04:01,632
Take a rest for two days

1828
02:04:02,042 --> 02:04:02,923
Ananthalakshmi..

1829
02:04:03,583 --> 02:04:04,543
Where is Lucky, son?

1830
02:04:10,963 --> 02:04:12,923
Raja, do not take Deva light.

1831
02:04:13,214 --> 02:04:14,254
He may harm Lucky

1832
02:04:15,584 --> 02:04:18,134
He does not need Lucky sir, but me

1833
02:04:19,004 --> 02:04:20,384
Now, I need that fellow.

1834
02:04:20,964 --> 02:04:23,464
Look into her eyes once. Look at her confidence

1835
02:04:23,835 --> 02:04:26,795
A confidence that he would
still come is seen in her eyes

1836
02:04:26,965 --> 02:04:28,425
I am not liking that confidence.

1837
02:04:28,635 --> 02:04:32,335
Let us first kill the confidence seen in her eyes
and then kill her

1838
02:04:32,965 --> 02:04:33,675
He will come

1839
02:04:33,835 --> 02:04:37,426
First time in life, he made me know
what fear is for five minutes.

1840
02:04:37,796 --> 02:04:39,046
He too should know, right?

1841
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,216
Hey Bujji...
ready.

1842
02:04:40,256 --> 02:04:41,426
Call him.
Ok.

1843
02:04:43,216 --> 02:04:43,836
Hello...

1844
02:04:44,046 --> 02:04:46,507
Ask him to put the speaker on Bujji
Heard it, right? Do it

1845
02:04:46,677 --> 02:04:47,257
Hey, you..

1846
02:04:49,007 --> 02:04:50,757
Lucky, mom is safe.

1847
02:04:52,547 --> 02:04:54,797
Say the idiot beside you to listen correctly

1848
02:04:56,138 --> 02:04:59,218
Time is 4 now and I will be there sharp by 8.

1849
02:05:00,008 --> 02:05:04,138
I will take you in front of his eyes.
He cannot do anything to me.

1850
02:05:04,968 --> 02:05:05,548
Hey..

1851
02:05:05,588 --> 02:05:08,049
Lucky, say I will not talk to him.

1852
02:05:08,299 --> 02:05:09,509
It is a cut if to him and me

1853
02:05:12,889 --> 02:05:16,339
I am saying again, I will be there by sharp 8.

1854
02:05:16,589 --> 02:05:17,840
It is a cut if to him and me

1855
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:23,300
Daddy, he says to take her with so confidence means...

1856
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:26,510
Alert as many people we have in the city

1857
02:05:28,641 --> 02:05:30,971
What bro, you called so urgently.

1858
02:05:31,051 --> 02:05:32,891
You just say and it will be done

1859
02:05:33,221 --> 02:05:34,681
Just to hit or to finish?

1860
02:05:35,011 --> 02:05:37,511
Say bro, we shall see his end

1861
02:05:37,801 --> 02:05:39,092
All of you listen carefully

1862
02:05:41,392 --> 02:05:44,762
Hello, it seems a problem has come for Deva bro...
A settlement here...

1863
02:05:44,802 --> 02:05:46,592
Hey, pack all the phones first and keep them aside

1864
02:05:49,593 --> 02:05:52,093
A blind fellow challenged to take this girl

1865
02:05:52,473 --> 02:05:54,223
Why is a blind fellow taking the girl

1866
02:05:54,303 --> 02:05:55,513
Because, I want to kill this girl

1867
02:05:55,553 --> 02:05:57,053
Why do you want to kill the girl?

1868
02:05:57,433 --> 02:05:59,263
Her dad killed my brother

1869
02:05:59,343 --> 02:06:00,934
You should then kill her father, right?

1870
02:06:00,974 --> 02:06:02,144
I already killed her daddy then

1871
02:06:02,184 --> 02:06:03,474
Why to kill this girl then?

1872
02:06:03,594 --> 02:06:05,264
Hey, my brother died because of her

1873
02:06:05,304 --> 02:06:07,014
Where did the blind come in between?

1874
02:06:07,054 --> 02:06:08,594
Why is the blind trying to save her?

1875
02:06:08,644 --> 02:06:10,805
What is the link with this girl to that blind?
Shut up

1876
02:06:11,015 --> 02:06:12,225
Hey, are you goons or writers?

1877
02:06:12,595 --> 02:06:15,055
Are any story sittings happening here that
you are asking for so many logics?

1878
02:06:15,345 --> 02:06:16,595
Why do you get angry bro?

1879
02:06:16,765 --> 02:06:20,555
Emotion would go well if content is known
and then we can mash them up.

1880
02:06:21,306 --> 02:06:22,476
Just one content,

1881
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:25,596
a blind is coming to take her and we should kill him

1882
02:06:25,686 --> 02:06:27,516
We will kill
We shall kill

1883
02:06:27,646 --> 02:06:29,436
We shall kill

1884
02:06:29,516 --> 02:06:32,057
Bro, I think it is a sin to kill a blind man

1885
02:06:34,267 --> 02:06:40,307
Your sins have gone too much now,
I will see your end

1886
02:06:40,397 --> 02:06:46,598
I am the punished for you,
I am the correct opponent for you

1887
02:06:56,689 --> 02:06:57,649
We have come

1888
02:06:58,599 --> 02:07:00,599
Oh God..

1889
02:07:00,979 --> 02:07:03,480
They made a trap
Trap or my foot

1890
02:07:03,690 --> 02:07:05,150
There Abhimanyu..
Leave it all..

1891
02:07:07,270 --> 02:07:12,060
Lucky, there is still 2 minutes time for what I said
and we are starting

1892
02:07:12,190 --> 02:07:14,851
Thanks Bujji, let us chitchat for 20 minutes

1893
02:07:16,521 --> 02:07:17,771
Come..come you bloody...

1894
02:07:21,691 --> 02:07:24,441
You challenged to take before my eyes sharp at 8 right?

1895
02:07:24,772 --> 02:07:25,312
Come on take

1896
02:07:25,522 --> 02:07:26,482
Come on take and I shall see

1897
02:07:26,812 --> 02:07:29,152
Yes, we will see how you take?
We will see

1898
02:07:29,312 --> 02:07:30,442
Will you see?
We will see

1899
02:07:30,522 --> 02:07:32,062
Will you see?
We will see

1900
02:07:32,232 --> 02:07:33,772
Will you see?
We will see

1901
02:07:33,902 --> 02:07:35,022
Start the countdown...

1902
02:07:35,062 --> 02:07:36,233
Ten..
Stop,

1903
02:07:36,313 --> 02:07:37,273
start from 5

1904
02:07:48,484 --> 02:07:49,854
Welcome to my world

1905
02:07:54,274 --> 02:07:55,444
Mylar Gadda
Yes

1906
02:07:55,484 --> 02:07:56,985
Do not leave me.
I will be right here, ok?

1907
02:07:57,065 --> 02:07:59,815
You said to see with a confidence to have eyes.

1908
02:08:00,155 --> 02:08:01,735
Now, you too have gone blind

1909
02:08:04,855 --> 02:08:08,236
We all now belong to the same community

1910
02:08:09,776 --> 02:08:14,196
All of you are going to now experience
how fierce would silence and darkness feel

1911
02:08:15,276 --> 02:08:15,986
Is it!

1912
02:08:19,237 --> 02:08:22,027
Let us have a rocking dark ride

1913
02:08:26,657 --> 02:08:28,318
Hey Chanti, do not leave me

1914
02:08:29,818 --> 02:08:31,568
Somebody go to the Generator and switch it on

1915
02:08:32,068 --> 02:08:33,608
Go to the main exit and lock the door

1916
02:08:33,658 --> 02:08:36,408
Shall I go to Green Bawarchi and biryani, you idiot?

1917
02:08:36,488 --> 02:08:38,778
You let go the girl coming in hand
and made a challenge

1918
02:08:38,858 --> 02:08:40,609
Now the girl is gone and even the eyes are gone

1919
02:08:40,859 --> 02:08:42,109
I will not leave that fellow,

1920
02:08:42,659 --> 02:08:43,319
bless me daddy

1921
02:08:43,409 --> 02:08:44,739
Do what ever! Goddess show Mercy on you.

1922
02:08:44,909 --> 02:08:46,739
There is the mercy of Goddess. I said no option and we shall go

1923
02:08:46,779 --> 02:08:49,409
Hey, if anyone sings along with me,
I will take them out

1924
02:08:50,450 --> 02:08:55,530
In the dark night,
behind the jasmine garden

1925
02:08:56,530 --> 02:09:02,911
Meet me in the evening
You will get what you like

1926
02:09:02,991 --> 02:09:05,531
You will get.. Ok?

1927
02:09:05,661 --> 02:09:09,991
Yes
Yes...

1928
02:09:10,161 --> 02:09:11,952
What guys, did you believe me saying to take you out?

1929
02:09:12,992 --> 02:09:15,412
No dudes, you are gone now

1930
02:09:17,702 --> 02:09:20,072
Hey, that fellow sang and is caught.

1931
02:09:20,282 --> 02:09:21,533
We shall not sing and not be caught.

1932
02:09:21,573 --> 02:09:22,573
Ok?
Ok

1933
02:09:22,613 --> 02:09:24,613
In the dark night...

1934
02:09:24,913 --> 02:09:28,493
Oh no! Do you think I am an idiot like that fellow?

1935
02:09:28,663 --> 02:09:29,863
I will not sing

1936
02:09:30,113 --> 02:09:32,284
Behind the jasmine garden

1937
02:09:32,494 --> 02:09:34,824
Do I not know that you are behind that?

1938
02:09:34,864 --> 02:09:37,744
Sing..come on sing.

1939
02:09:37,864 --> 02:09:39,864
I will not sing...

1940
02:09:39,994 --> 02:09:40,784
Come on sing.

1941
02:09:40,954 --> 02:09:44,705
I will not sing...

1942
02:09:45,115 --> 02:09:47,575
Have you seen dude? I did not sing and he is gone

1943
02:09:47,665 --> 02:09:49,615
You are caught my dear
How is that?

1944
02:09:49,665 --> 02:09:51,955
You have spoken saying not to sing, right?

1945
02:09:52,035 --> 02:09:55,076
Oh no, we are caught dudes
You got us hit bloody

1946
02:09:56,136 --> 02:09:56,886
Lift that box. Other wise, we will be find.

1947
02:09:57,486 --> 02:09:58,946
Bujji, a box is sounding here.

1948
02:09:59,366 --> 02:10:00,926
I am getting fear.

1949
02:10:06,787 --> 02:10:07,777
I think nobody is here. Let's go.

1950
02:10:07,977 --> 02:10:09,607
Wait. The breathe sound is coming, right?

1951
02:10:09,807 --> 02:10:10,827
Wait, we will listen.

1952
02:10:11,027 --> 02:10:11,747
Nobody is here. Let's go.

1953
02:10:13,667 --> 02:10:14,908
Some sweat smell is coming.

1954
02:10:15,128 --> 02:10:17,088
A rat might have died, it's not the sweat smell.

1955
02:10:17,838 --> 02:10:18,498
Is it so?

1956
02:10:18,698 --> 02:10:19,388
Do one thing. Hold us and let's go.

1957
02:10:20,758 --> 02:10:21,368
Where are you?

1958
02:10:23,708 --> 02:10:24,478
Nobody is here. Let's go.

1959
02:10:24,678 --> 02:10:24,958
Ok, coming.

1960
02:10:25,699 --> 02:10:26,499
Nobody is here.

1961
02:10:26,819 --> 02:10:27,499
Nobody is here. Hold us.

1962
02:10:27,699 --> 02:10:28,149
Let's go.

1963
02:10:31,499 --> 02:10:32,449
you left us... Oh no

1964
02:10:33,949 --> 02:10:36,870
Wow... You are enjoying great
calling us into your dark world

1965
02:10:37,370 --> 02:10:41,160
Deva...cutie pie...catch me.

1966
02:10:44,700 --> 02:10:47,121
This blind is hitting us badly in the darkness

1967
02:10:47,161 --> 02:10:50,621
This fool is distributing bullets
to our own people like snacks

1968
02:10:50,661 --> 02:10:52,121
Bro, you are shooting us

1969
02:10:52,281 --> 02:10:54,241
Where..where are you hid.

1970
02:10:55,071 --> 02:10:57,162
Bro, you are shooting our own guys

1971
02:10:57,452 --> 02:11:00,372
That fellow is confusing my son
moving like a bat in the dark

1972
02:11:00,492 --> 02:11:02,662
My son is killing our guys shooting with the gun

1973
02:11:02,742 --> 02:11:03,952
Why did you call us?

1974
02:11:04,072 --> 02:11:06,202
Is it to kill that fellow
or for us to be killed in your hands?

1975
02:11:06,282 --> 02:11:07,532
Whom are you killing, idiot?

1976
02:11:07,823 --> 02:11:10,373
Both of you together are torturing us...

1977
02:11:10,413 --> 02:11:12,993
I am not married even for once and
do you know where all did the bullets pierce bro?

1978
02:11:13,163 --> 02:11:15,283
Is this a generator factory or Jalianwala Bagh?

1979
02:11:15,873 --> 02:11:18,324
Hey, all of you look for some exit and get out

1980
02:11:18,534 --> 02:11:20,164
Thanks bro
Thanks bro

1981
02:11:20,414 --> 02:11:23,454
Bro, what is the relation between that blind
and this girl?

1982
02:11:24,474 --> 02:11:26,564
Everybody is asking logics after watching many films.

1983
02:11:27,044 --> 02:11:27,414
Deva!

1984
02:11:27,614 --> 02:11:27,894
I will kill.

1985
02:11:28,094 --> 02:11:29,425
It's me Mailaragadda.

1986
02:11:29,795 --> 02:11:30,195
Son!

1987
02:11:30,425 --> 02:11:30,775
Father!

1988
02:11:30,975 --> 02:11:32,525
He can do anything in the darkness.

1989
02:11:32,745 --> 02:11:33,425
How can you do that?

1990
02:11:34,825 --> 02:11:37,535
Daddy! As I have not seen, I have a nose and ears.

1991
02:11:37,745 --> 02:11:39,616
If he is Raja the great, I am Deva the great.

1992
02:11:40,216 --> 02:11:42,026
Daddy! I will know him wherever he is.

1993
02:11:42,456 --> 02:11:43,546
I will know him wherever he is.

1994
02:11:43,786 --> 02:11:44,886
I will know him if he is here.

1995
02:11:46,176 --> 02:11:47,726
My gun? My gun has robbered by a cat. My gun!

1996
02:11:48,446 --> 02:11:48,756
Deva!

1997
02:11:49,336 --> 02:11:51,757
The person who was here beside me is that blind fellow.

1998
02:11:51,957 --> 02:11:52,547
He theft that.

1999
02:11:52,987 --> 02:11:53,907
Why did you tell that earlier?

2000
02:11:54,137 --> 02:11:55,767
You have irritation with my voice, right?

2001
02:11:57,157 --> 02:11:58,837
Dude, what are their facial expressions in the dark?

2002
02:11:59,037 --> 02:12:01,008
What facial expressions in the dark,
you should say sound waves

2003
02:12:01,048 --> 02:12:02,548
Oh, what are those waves?

2004
02:12:02,758 --> 02:12:05,218
They are struggling in between cries and screams

2005
02:12:09,258 --> 02:12:12,129
Wow... now it is jumping time

2006
02:12:15,009 --> 02:12:16,059
Is he there or gone?

2007
02:12:16,259 --> 02:12:18,899
Who will Know
even i don't know r u here or not.

2008
02:12:19,079 --> 02:12:19,639
Saraswathi

2009
02:12:19,839 --> 02:12:22,820
Saraswathi..Saraswathi..
Even her husband also not thinks about her.

2010
02:12:23,220 --> 02:12:25,630
Anathalakshmi..I brought lucky

2011
02:12:30,090 --> 02:12:33,091
Thanks a lot aunty! You and Raja did so much for me

2012
02:12:33,591 --> 02:12:35,841
The good done by your dad is saving you dear

2013
02:12:40,221 --> 02:12:40,761
Raja..

2014
02:12:41,091 --> 02:12:43,802
I cannot say you in words about how happy I am

2015
02:12:55,803 --> 02:12:58,013
Oh no Bhamchik,
what happened that you became so?

2016
02:12:58,053 --> 02:12:59,013
What happened son, what is in that?

2017
02:12:59,053 --> 02:12:59,803
No idea, look mom

2018
02:12:59,883 --> 02:13:00,423
Aunty

2019
02:13:02,803 --> 02:13:04,844
Oh no! Those seeing are going stiff,
what did you write?

2020
02:13:05,924 --> 02:13:08,134
I wrote 'I Love You' in brailey, that is all

2021
02:13:09,344 --> 02:13:10,554
Aunty..
No

2022
02:13:10,844 --> 02:13:11,924
Bujji...
No

2023
02:13:11,974 --> 02:13:13,134
Raja...
Oh no

2024
02:13:13,304 --> 02:13:14,224
Hey Bhamchik

2025
02:13:14,304 --> 02:13:16,345
Hey Bujji, what is my facial expression?

2026
02:13:16,555 --> 02:13:19,675
It is glowing in between happiness and surprise

2027
02:13:20,305 --> 02:13:25,135
Those saying what love for your face
and those saying no girl falls for you...

2028
02:13:25,175 --> 02:13:27,056
Enter one by one Bujji...

2029
02:13:27,136 --> 02:13:28,306
I will

2030
02:13:42,177 --> 02:13:45,727
A girl before my house and her name is Mangala Gowri

2031
02:13:45,847 --> 02:13:49,388
My first love story and I loved by selecting

2032
02:13:49,558 --> 02:13:56,678
Oh God, I followed her so many times

2033
02:13:56,978 --> 02:14:00,599
She rang the cycle bell and knocked my heart

2034
02:14:00,639 --> 02:14:04,269
Her anklets sounded and my body shook

2035
02:14:04,389 --> 02:14:11,350
Oh my God, I kept so many love letters in her books

2036
02:14:11,730 --> 02:14:15,180
Education was second inter
and my moustache just entered

2037
02:14:15,430 --> 02:14:19,021
When the matter was setting, you ruined that Peter

2038
02:14:19,101 --> 02:14:24,391
Oh God, you said love is waste for my face

2039
02:14:24,431 --> 02:14:28,391
Where will you hide your face now?

2040
02:14:28,481 --> 02:14:35,562
Oh God, luck came along with Lucky in my life

2041
02:14:50,313 --> 02:14:53,984
Roja in B Com opened love door

2042
02:14:54,184 --> 02:14:57,604
Raja being calm has sounded a band

2043
02:14:57,934 --> 02:15:05,105
Oh God, sir fell in love again for the second time

2044
02:15:05,235 --> 02:15:08,815
Scent and glamour came, front and back have changed

2045
02:15:08,985 --> 02:15:12,776
Srinu brought bike and we went to Cinema and park

2046
02:15:12,856 --> 02:15:19,986
Oh God, we chatted a lot in land phone

2047
02:15:20,066 --> 02:15:23,687
It was then the marriage scene
and the groom was Gold Srinu

2048
02:15:23,737 --> 02:15:27,357
Back bone broke and wine was left for me

2049
02:15:27,687 --> 02:15:32,737
You cheated me from back, Oh God

2050
02:15:32,937 --> 02:15:36,318
What will you say about this stunning beauty?

2051
02:15:36,818 --> 02:15:43,778
Oh God, luck came along with Lucky in my life

2052
02:16:06,111 --> 02:16:09,821
We are super hit but our love stories are flop

2053
02:16:09,901 --> 02:16:13,491
My mom got doubt and we went to the gate of Sastry

2054
02:16:13,571 --> 02:16:20,652
Oh God, he saw many hand lines in magnifying glass

2055
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:24,612
He opened the horoscope and did some calculations

2056
02:16:24,692 --> 02:16:28,283
He saw the Jupiter and confirmed the fault

2057
02:16:28,533 --> 02:16:35,493
Oh God, he said there was
no chance of a girl in my fate

2058
02:16:35,743 --> 02:16:39,404
He wrote my astrology and took a quarter acre

2059
02:16:39,444 --> 02:16:43,154
He performed some worship and wasted all my money

2060
02:16:43,244 --> 02:16:48,285
Oh God, you ate lakhs by swiping

2061
02:16:48,405 --> 02:16:52,285
Planets brought down a beautiful babe in my lap

2062
02:16:52,535 --> 02:16:59,616
Oh God, luck came along with Lucky in my life

2063
02:17:14,947 --> 02:17:15,497
Hey..what?

2064
02:17:15,617 --> 02:17:16,577
I thought it dance moment..

2065
02:17:16,657 --> 02:17:17,537
What moment? Go..

2066
02:17:21,748 --> 02:17:24,038
He said the dark truth while leaving

2067
02:17:24,538 --> 02:17:30,248
Switching the cell phones on, inverters, generators,
candles and everything is stopped when power is gone

2068
02:17:31,039 --> 02:17:32,119
We shall eat in dark,

2069
02:17:32,579 --> 02:17:38,079
should walk in dark and said to respect darkness too.

2070
02:17:38,539 --> 02:17:39,369
How will we?

2071
02:17:40,329 --> 02:17:42,160
The darkness is great

2072
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:43,660
The darkness is great

2073
02:17:43,700 --> 02:17:45,250
The warm darkness

2074
02:17:45,330 --> 02:17:46,660
The warm darkness

2075
02:17:46,750 --> 02:17:51,000
The beautiful darkness

2076
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:52,411
Hey..stop that nonsense

2077
02:18:09,542 --> 02:18:11,372
Deva, one good news for you

2078
02:18:13,003 --> 02:18:18,833
Raja while going away with Lucky has brought all
the evidences about your dark secret activities

2079
02:18:19,953 --> 02:18:20,503
It is locked.

2080
02:18:21,373 --> 02:18:22,123
You go back

2081
02:18:23,874 --> 02:18:24,504
Bujji laptop..

2082
02:18:26,124 --> 02:18:26,664
Bujji locker.

2083
02:18:27,004 --> 02:18:27,584
Password.

2084
02:18:30,954 --> 02:18:31,874
Come..

2085
02:18:33,954 --> 02:18:35,455
This is the arrest warrant coming from the Court

2086
02:18:37,585 --> 02:18:40,505
Look, I am the Minister here
and what are you saying warrant?

2087
02:18:40,625 --> 02:18:43,705
Links between you and Deva are full of a hard disk

2088
02:18:45,086 --> 02:18:46,666
Why do you still see, call the CM

2089
02:18:46,836 --> 02:18:50,666
Deva, your voice is very irritating
and I did not like it

2090
02:18:50,916 --> 02:18:52,956
You know, I do not have the option to resign now

2091
02:18:53,126 --> 02:18:55,046
Look Mailaram Gadda, I will leave now.

2092
02:18:55,086 --> 02:18:57,837
Hey Police, move.
The law goes in its own course

2093
02:18:58,007 --> 02:19:00,007
Deva, your game is over

2094
02:19:01,377 --> 02:19:05,127
Is that fellow robbing in darkness
and taking the evidences, a man?

2095
02:19:08,628 --> 02:19:13,088
Being Police, you came to arrest me taking
the help of a blind and are you Police?

2096
02:19:15,798 --> 02:19:20,839
If he has the guts, ask him to fight from front,
kill me and then take that girl

2097
02:19:21,089 --> 02:19:22,009
Where to come, idiot?

2098
02:19:22,509 --> 02:19:25,419
Where to come? You fix the place and time

2099
02:19:25,629 --> 02:19:29,880
I will bring my son along with
Lucky in the day to the place you say

2100
02:19:31,630 --> 02:19:33,760
Down the guns, please down them

2101
02:19:34,210 --> 02:19:35,670
All these evidences are yours, right?

2102
02:19:36,710 --> 02:19:37,340
Hard disk...

2103
02:19:38,841 --> 02:19:39,591
Laptop...

2104
02:19:43,211 --> 02:19:43,961
Arrest warrant!

2105
02:19:44,131 --> 02:19:46,421
Mrs. Ananthalakshmi,
you will lose your job doing like this

2106
02:19:47,091 --> 02:19:50,302
I let go my own husband for looking cheap at my son.

2107
02:19:50,552 --> 02:19:52,132
What is this job after all sir?

2108
02:19:53,132 --> 02:19:57,552
Still, what are you idiot?
My son gave you the option to happily live in jail,

2109
02:19:57,762 --> 02:19:59,213
but you are getting ready to die?

2110
02:20:00,633 --> 02:20:03,593
What a discussion with this fellow
cruelly killing five Police sir?

2111
02:20:03,713 --> 02:20:04,923
He himself gave us a chance.

2112
02:20:06,303 --> 02:20:08,133
You believed my son for so long right?

2113
02:20:08,553 --> 02:20:10,424
Just believe my son for another 24 hours.

2114
02:20:11,054 --> 02:20:14,344
Hey, I am saying again. I will bring my son.

2115
02:20:14,844 --> 02:20:18,094
Fix time and place and send the location in WhatsApp.

2116
02:20:18,344 --> 02:20:19,174
You move sir.

2117
02:20:20,925 --> 02:20:21,845
Hey old man
Madam

2118
02:20:22,015 --> 02:20:25,515
My WhatsApp number is 8074545422

2119
02:20:25,925 --> 02:20:29,305
Jio number son, net is free.
Send how many ever you want to

2120
02:20:29,675 --> 02:20:33,266
When I scolded a blind fellow,
his mom reacted so much.

2121
02:20:33,966 --> 02:20:37,926
You did not say even a word
when she scolded me so much?

2122
02:20:38,136 --> 02:20:40,596
That is, he is blind and you...

2123
02:20:40,846 --> 02:20:42,267
You have no love at all on me

2124
02:20:44,217 --> 02:20:45,057
Not even a bit...

2125
02:20:45,217 --> 02:20:46,967
A little bit..

2126
02:20:48,517 --> 02:20:48,967
Damn

2127
02:20:52,268 --> 02:20:53,018
Bless me daddy

2128
02:20:53,308 --> 02:20:54,268
Mercy of the Goddess

2129
02:20:55,718 --> 02:21:01,598
Hey beautiful lady... baby, come to the mango garden

2130
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:20,180
Here Bujji, catch and do not wear

2131
02:21:20,350 --> 02:21:21,350
Son
Ananthalakshmi

2132
02:21:21,430 --> 02:21:23,350
How much time will you take?
Maybe it would take 30 minutes

2133
02:21:24,561 --> 02:21:28,311
It is too sunny and daughter in law is too white.

2134
02:21:28,521 --> 02:21:30,391
Will she not get tanned?
Ok, if I finish in 20 minutes?

2135
02:21:30,641 --> 02:21:31,431
Ok, go on

2136
02:21:31,471 --> 02:21:33,061
He will finish in 20 minutes!

2137
02:21:33,141 --> 02:21:34,471
Daddy, how am I looking to this fellow?

2138
02:21:34,681 --> 02:21:36,142
He cannot see, right son?

2139
02:21:39,062 --> 02:21:40,562
Hey Bujji.. Is anybody here?

2140
02:21:40,602 --> 02:21:41,142
Yes.

2141
02:21:41,182 --> 02:21:43,602
Then ask him to come. Hey idiot Devaraju, come on

2142
02:21:43,642 --> 02:21:44,772
Hey come on man, he is calling right?

2143
02:24:04,486 --> 02:24:06,826
I love this expression

2144
02:24:07,036 --> 02:24:08,196
See..

2145
02:24:08,906 --> 02:24:10,406
Is he your confidence?

2146
02:24:10,616 --> 02:24:12,486
Your confidence fell on my feet

2147
02:24:12,576 --> 02:24:14,577
I will not let him live

2148
02:24:15,367 --> 02:24:16,327
In front of your eyes...

2149
02:24:16,447 --> 02:24:20,117
Hey Police, in front of your eyes I am killing

2150
02:24:20,157 --> 02:24:21,117
Wait.

2151
02:24:23,157 --> 02:24:24,157
Do not harm him,

2152
02:24:25,618 --> 02:24:26,988
he is my only son

2153
02:24:28,618 --> 02:24:31,288
It is all my mistake. I did a mistake.

2154
02:24:32,238 --> 02:24:35,489
He is blind, do not harm him.

2155
02:24:36,739 --> 02:24:38,659
You think I would say so, idiot?

2156
02:24:41,989 --> 02:24:43,579
Mercy of Goddess..

2157
02:24:44,449 --> 02:24:47,660
My son got beaten by you,
not because he cannot hit you

2158
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:53,540
You confused him with sound
and he habituated this place with his brain and body

2159
02:25:03,621 --> 02:25:07,792
Now east, west, north and south... 360 degrees,

2160
02:25:07,912 --> 02:25:09,992
everything here is in the control of my son now.

2161
02:25:12,992 --> 02:25:15,242
I am now giving you exactly five minutes of time.

2162
02:25:15,702 --> 02:25:18,453
If you have the guts, save yourself from my son

2163
02:25:19,743 --> 02:25:23,873
My son is blind, but he is trained

2164
02:25:32,084 --> 02:25:33,544
Bujji
Yes

2165
02:25:33,664 --> 02:25:35,374
What is his facial expression?

2166
02:25:35,704 --> 02:25:37,584
It is glowing in between challenge and victory

2167
02:25:38,044 --> 02:25:39,955
I did not like it

2168
02:26:25,379 --> 02:26:26,499
Hey..no.

2169
02:26:38,550 --> 02:26:42,130
I can listen to the beating sound of your heart.

2170
02:26:44,751 --> 02:26:48,461
You lost, means you are dead

2171
02:26:50,751 --> 02:26:51,461
Bujji
Yes

2172
02:26:51,631 --> 02:26:52,881
What is his facial expression?

2173
02:26:52,921 --> 02:26:55,462
It is fighting in between loss and death

2174
02:26:55,632 --> 02:26:58,172
Yes, it is end titles time

2175
02:27:03,802 --> 02:27:05,303
Saraswathi Madam..
Yes sir

2176
02:27:05,463 --> 02:27:06,713
What is going to happen here now?

2177
02:27:07,303 --> 02:27:10,673
When Police came to arrest,
my Sir attacked on the Police

2178
02:27:10,843 --> 02:27:13,843
Will Police be calm? They encountered and that is all

2179
02:27:14,383 --> 02:27:15,134
Saraswathi Madam.

2180
02:27:16,594 --> 02:27:17,304
Good bye Deva

2181
02:27:23,804 --> 02:27:24,754
Bless me daddy

2182
02:27:24,964 --> 02:27:25,925
Mercy of the Goddess -- TamilMV.re

2183
02:27:26,135 --> 02:27:31,715
In that way, Raja the great married Lucky
and got ready for the next scene

2184
02:27:33,425 --> 02:27:36,806
You did great but you didn't win..
bad luck, it is ok

2185
02:27:36,886 --> 02:27:38,596
Shall I go to Bigg Boss 2 then?
I will kill you

2186
02:27:40,216 --> 02:27:42,386
Raja, you are really great

2187
02:27:43,136 --> 02:27:43,926
Here is the stick

2188
02:27:43,966 --> 02:27:45,136
Damn it, I have no work with it today

2189
02:27:45,216 --> 02:27:46,056
Then?

2190
02:27:46,256 --> 02:27:48,507
Bujji, shall I leave now?

2191
02:27:51,177 --> 02:27:52,637
Oh no, is it the shy feeling?

2192
02:27:54,177 --> 02:27:55,347
All the best.

2193
02:27:59,718 --> 02:28:00,968
Welcome to my world.

2194
02:28:02,638 --> 02:28:05,468
This is a very difficult operation sir,
a trained officer is needed for this.

2195
02:28:05,848 --> 02:28:08,389
No problem sir, I have a man. I will take care

2196
02:28:08,679 --> 02:28:09,559
Sir..here.

2197
02:28:09,599 --> 02:28:11,889
All varieties of sweets, please take

2198
02:28:12,059 --> 02:28:14,139
He already proved and is this required?

2199
02:28:14,599 --> 02:28:15,469
Phone from madam, Sir

2200
02:28:15,719 --> 02:28:17,259
You anyways have brought, let it be

2201
02:28:17,389 --> 02:28:18,760
He is asking to keep it, let it be

2202
02:28:18,850 --> 02:28:19,640
Raja
Yes

2203
02:28:19,810 --> 02:28:21,930
You got to travel to Europe.
Here..

2204
02:28:24,140 --> 02:28:25,060
Bujji
Yes.

2205
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:28,720
Ananthalakshmi, Europe trip!
It would be cool there it seems...
