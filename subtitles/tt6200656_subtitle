1
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:41,637
‘Kammaran, The Event!‘

2
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:05,336
Alcohol",

3
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:09,106
is the official beverage of
Kerala, as per the old saying.

4
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:12,386
The governments that came to
power one after the other,

5
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,189
kept changing <i>&</i> correcting the liquor
policy, as per their whims and fancies,

6
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:19,217
and kept shutting down
bars or re-opening them.

7
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:21,797
To find a permanent
solution to this,

8
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:24,699
for their own survival
and daily bread,

9
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,760
the liquor barons of Kerala",

10
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:31,671
gathered under this flag that you
can see here, in this house,

11
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:34,375
for a secret rendezvous.

12
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:48,812
KP Manukumar gave me a secret information
that a battle has commenced at Palayam.

13
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:52,726
If this is true,

14
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,924
this ministry will not last
any longer than one year.

15
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:01,234
And this one year's time
is what we have in hand.

16
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:05,900
Within that, we should turn this small
party called lLP into a mega institution.

17
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:10,437
Achaya, in our state, there are
some Lefties and some Righties.

18
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:15,375
And the people whom they trick and
get votes from, by taking turns.

19
00:04:15,473 --> 00:04:18,215
No one cares what all
was done by who all"!

20
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:22,322
If you have ruled for 5 years, the
others should rule for the next 5 years.

21
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:23,356
That's all...!!

22
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,291
This is a land where
nothing new grows.

23
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,928
One Left and one Right",

24
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:29,629
and we're the ones
who are in trouble.

25
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:32,327
It's like that saying that even
if the father or the uncle comes,

26
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,527
the mother can't sleep.

27
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:34,668
Sheesh!

28
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:35,670
Boys,

29
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,900
from the day Kerala was formed on
November 1st, 1956, until today,

30
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:44,575
on every flag that was hoisted
by the politicians here,

31
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:46,646
on every graffiti
that they created,

32
00:04:46,804 --> 00:04:51,776
in every meeting, procession,
protest and strike held by them,

33
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:56,351
what flows is the money that came out
of us liquor barons' sweat & blood.

34
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:57,992
But hereafter",

35
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:01,758
Hereafter, we are not going
to help any of them.

36
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,766
To sell only beer and
wine when they ask us to,

37
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,235
to shut down and re-open
at their command,

38
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:09,236
hereafter,

39
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,239
they won't get any self-respecting
liquor baron here to do that.

40
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:13,940
Because, hereafter",

41
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:16,476
we're going to play the political
games here, ourselves.

42
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,411
Be it Left, or Right.

43
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:23,648
Hereafter, there should never be a
ministry in Kerala without our ILP in it.

44
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:25,252
That should be our goal.

45
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:29,422
The goal sounds good.

46
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:34,487
But this is a party that can't even win a
Panchayat ward, even if it contests alone.

47
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:36,631
And you're dreaming of
all that, with this?

48
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,664
What the hell does
this party have?

49
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:41,903
History!

50
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:44,801
Not just history,

51
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,673
a historical figure, as well.

52
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,603
Historical figure?

53
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,011
<i>Achaya,</i>

54
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:52,007
even we know history.

55
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,579
Anything else?
- It's not enough that we know it.

56
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,343
The people of Kerala
should know it.

57
00:05:57,675 --> 00:05:58,653
Boys,

58
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:05,588
I had a reason to out-rightly buy this
lame, paralysed party called lLP.

59
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:07,689
What ILP has,

60
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:13,630
is not some teeny-weeny leader who shouted
lame slogans wearing torn undergarments,

61
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:18,538
against the useless ministers
of the 1960's and 70's.

62
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:19,840
True! True!

63
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,075
Instead,

64
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:24,411
one who fought against
the British empire,

65
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:27,013
one who stood with his head held
high in front of British leaders,

66
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:28,982
one who kissed the
British hangman's rope,

67
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,384
the brave and mighty,

68
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:36,051
moreover, the oldest freedom
fighter alive today,

69
00:06:36,414 --> 00:06:37,392
<i>Kammaran.</i>

70
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,484

LP's very own...

71
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,756
Kammaran Nambiar!

72
00:06:42,953 --> 00:06:46,662
People should know about this
history and this historical figure.

73
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:48,069
Have a look.

74
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:50,630
Page 120.
Chapter 8.

75
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:52,103
Kammaran Nambiar!

76
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,034
"Kera
a's forgotten hero"!

77
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:56,410
Is this about our Kammarettan?

78
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:58,846
No one has heard about
this old bloke so far.

79
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:01,847
If we bring him to the forefront
one fine morning.. Shucks!

80
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:04,052
Is this your damn plan?

81
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,353
Sheesh.

82
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:10,051
Hey! Had you heard about
Tsunami before 2004?

83
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:14,761
Had any of you heard about
Anna Hazare before 2011?

84
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:19,099
This Kammarettan
whom we have with us,

85
00:07:19,123 --> 00:07:21,433
has the capacity to be the
grand-daddy of An na Hazare.

86
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:24,534
We just need to create
a small earthquake",

87
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:28,039
and what awaits us here would
be a political tsunami.

88
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:32,471
It's not any good for nothing
Pillai, Nair or Embranthiri...

89
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,073
who has written about
our founder leader.

90
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:38,746
It's a first class
22 carat Englishman!

91
00:07:38,943 --> 00:07:41,685
Look!
Robert S. Coogan

92
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:44,149
Let me see.

93
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,453
My dad kept forcing
me to learn English.

94
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:48,763
But I didn't listen.

95
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:50,389
Good that you didn't learn it.

96
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:53,834
N.. O.. V.. E.. L

97
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:56,805
Achaya, this is not history.
It's a novel!

98
00:07:57,495 --> 00:07:58,473
You fool...!!

99
00:07:58,529 --> 00:07:59,837
The novels written
by the British,

100
00:07:59,964 --> 00:08:03,434
have always been considered to be history
by Indians. Don't you know that yet?

101
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:06,515
But Achaya, how are we going
to create this earthquake?

102
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:09,381
Cinema..!!

103
00:08:12,643 --> 00:08:13,917
Francis sir,

104
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:15,751
I read this book
that you gave me.

105
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:19,188
Nothing interesting.

106
00:08:20,551 --> 00:08:22,087
There's just one chapter
about Kammaran.

107
00:08:22,686 --> 00:08:23,824
There are no details.

108
00:08:24,188 --> 00:08:27,135
It's just usual period stuff.

109
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:29,137
If I have to make a
movie in Malayalam,

110
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:32,037
moreover, if I have to make a movie
about someone who's still alive,

111
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:33,975
I need something interesting.

112
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:37,137
Maybe, if I meet him.

113
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,673
Pulikesi sir, we need only
what's there in this book.

114
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,517
Englishmen won't
write lies, do they?

115
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,518
It's not just that.

116
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:46,749
(speaking in broken Tamil)
This Kammaran..

117
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:49,950
he was a great freedom fighter"
- Francis sir,

118
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:51,118
<i>Talk in Malayalam.</i>

119
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:52,459
<i>I know Malayalam.</i>

120
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:53,461
Oh! You do?

121
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:54,762
Very good.

122
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:57,129
And that Am ruthasam ud ram
mentioned in this book..

123
00:08:57,588 --> 00:08:58,566
Where is it?

124
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:00,226
That's a godforsaken place.

125
00:09:00,491 --> 00:09:02,698
At the KeraIa-Karnataka-
Tamil Nadu border.

126
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,670
You've to climb many hills..

127
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:07,775
So,

128
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:11,111
let's meet Mr. Kammaran.

129
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,059
That's Kammarettan's son.

130
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,562
His name is Bose.

131
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:30,459
He named him after Netaji,
out of extreme patriotism.

132
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:32,766
Namaste!
- Come, sirs.

133
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,100
All of you have come?
- Yes. Namaste.

134
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:38,569
Well sir, will this movie have
just my father's story,

135
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,107
or will it have his
son's story as well?

136
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,539
Calm down, Bose.

137
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,840
Didn't I tell you?
This will be beneficial for all of us.

138
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:45,938
I don't trust this because
you're part of this.

139
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:48,207
This ILP (s) of his..,

140
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:50,650
it was actually a party founded
by my father.

141
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,850
In the 1957 election,
EMS' boys beat him badly.

142
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:56,892
With that, my father quit politics.

143
00:09:56,947 --> 00:09:58,949
He was the one who used to
buy tea for my dad then.

144
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,927
This Southie"
Surendar Ji.

145
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:02,555
And during the election in '97,

146
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,861
he told me that Kammarettan
is a freedom fighter.

147
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:08,893
And if Kammarettan's son contests, we'll
definitely win and made many such promises!

148
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,566
I lost all my hard-earned
money I made from the Gulf.

149
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:14,973
And a studio which I had, he
got it registered to his name!

150
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,236
Let it be, Bose.

151
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:17,936
How is your father?

152
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:20,809
Father, look who all are
here to see you!

153
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:21,949
Get up.

154
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:23,116
Who is it?

155
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,279
It's me, Kammaretta.
Surendran.

156
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,982
Not just him, father.

157
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,781
There are some other gentlemen too.
- You aren't dead yet?

158
00:10:31,148 --> 00:10:33,128
We came to give
you a great news.

159
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:34,285
What?

160
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:38,865
All of us are going to make a
movie about you, Kammarettan.

161
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,967
You won't let me be
in peace, right?

162
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:42,969
Please get up.

163
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:44,563
Hey,just hold him.

164
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:46,135
Slowly".

165
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,658
Let him see..

166
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:07,087
It's all coming back
to your mind, right?

167
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,229
Yes.

168
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:10,063
How did you find all this?

169
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,293
We found it!

170
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:13,266
He's a great director from Tamil.

171
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,361
All the films he made...
are superhits.

172
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,977
Your mother is a
Malayali, right?

173
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:24,712
Yes.

174
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:26,212
H.. How do you know that?

175
00:11:32,176 --> 00:11:34,782
I like artists.

176
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,149
But these businessmen,

177
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:40,693
and politicians,

178
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:45,132
Bose...

179
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:47,401
All of you step out.
Didn't you hear him?

180
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:49,098
Take your wife also.
-Are you sick, dad?

181
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,871
You also go out.
- Chandrabhanu, come on.

182
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:52,105
Huh?
- Chetta,

183
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:55,201
Come. - This is trouble
from the beginning itself.

184
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:58,042
- Bloody old bloke!
- I'll kick you. Try calling me again!

185
00:11:58,235 --> 00:11:59,942
Achaya, what the hell is this?

186
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:02,315
Aren't we spending the money?
So shouldn't we hear the story?

187
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,785
First let the director listen to it.
We'll hear it later.

188
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:06,788
So the producers don't
have any value?

189
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:07,854
But sir..,

190
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:10,222
why do you need a Tamil director
to make a Malayalam film?

191
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:11,725
Bro..,

192
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:17,131
every director in Malayalam is inclined
either towards the Left or the Right.

193
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:20,963
If we give this to them,
we'll be screwed before we know it.

194
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:22,436
Right?
- That's true.

195
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:24,439
My lighter?

196
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:42,685
Sit down, kiddo..

197
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:43,782
Thank you sir.

198
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:48,389
Do you know, kiddo?

199
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:52,900
It's been a really longtime...

200
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:54,833
since I slept.

201
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:59,808
Until 5 or 6 years back,

202
00:13:00,831 --> 00:13:02,242
if I stretched my back",

203
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:06,474
and held my palms
close to my chest",

204
00:13:07,772 --> 00:13:10,275
my eyes used to
close on their own.

205
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:14,256
And I'd get a peaceful sleep.

206
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:18,460
One night,

207
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,753
I lost my sleep, kiddo.

208
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:25,490
Have you heard of
Selvan Baba, the Clairvoyant?

209
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:29,465
He's a great sage.

210
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:32,874
With extra sensory powers.

211
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:34,409
There...

212
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:39,171
He came and stood there once,

213
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:40,976
and told me..,

214
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,817
<i>Kammaran,</i>

215
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:45,980
7 years from now,

216
00:13:46,444 --> 00:13:49,891
someone born to a Tamil
father and a Malayali mother,

217
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:53,520
will come searching for you,
to listen to your story.

218
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:55,323
Before him,

219
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:57,090
like an enthusiastic parrot,

220
00:13:57,188 --> 00:14:01,295
you should narrate everything
that happened so far, truthfully.

221
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:05,905
Or else, you would never
be able to sleep.

222
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:06,941
So...

223
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,245
You are the one,
he told me about!

224
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:18,551
Shall we start then?

225
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:20,517
Listen, kiddo",

226
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:23,525
This is not a story.

227
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:27,862
This is the actual History.

228
00:14:40,598 --> 00:14:43,408
(Chapter 1 : The story, as per Kammaran)
Didn't you climb a hill on the way, kiddo?

229
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:46,343
That's called 'Traitor's Hill'.

230
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:52,446
Back then, the Nambiars who betrayed
the Kolathiri King,

231
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:56,150
were banished to the
other side of the hill.

232
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,328
So, the hill that the traitor
crossed, became the 'Traitor's Hill'.

233
00:15:00,618 --> 00:15:05,033
Back then, it was 'Malayil' Kelu Nambiar,
who ruled the land as the landlord.

234
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:08,093
Unbeknownst to the British,

235
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,369
Kelu brought in Tamilians from Ceylon,

236
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:18,346
<i>made them work day and night, and
Geared the forests at Amruthasamudram,</i>

237
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:21,576
and turned it into
huge sugar cane fields.

238
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:26,453
He tortured and killed the
men among the Tamilians"

239
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:31,085
And he enjoyed their women
as much as he wanted!

240
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:39,300
Othenan.

241
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:42,900
He said that he went away to study.

242
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:45,599
But I know,

243
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,039
he left because
he hated it here.

244
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:53,409
It's all right, grandmother.

245
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:56,913
Gosh!
Uncle Ke
u..!

246
00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:13,657
How are you, mother?

247
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,953
Come.

248
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,523
I educated you till 7th grade, so
that you could help your grandmother.

249
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,594
And not for your mother, who eloped
with that bloody scoundrel; my sister!

250
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,436
Kelu...

251
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:51,637
When a man commits a sin..,

252
00:16:52,163 --> 00:16:55,508
...Time would stand still
and silent like a mute.

253
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,644
But..

254
00:16:57,034 --> 00:17:00,015
It will open its mouth
some day in the future.

255
00:17:00,538 --> 00:17:02,711
It will shout out
whatever it has to say...,

256
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,314
rip apart the one who
committed the sin, and eat him up!

257
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:22,370
Hey!

258
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:31,279
Doppanna,

259
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:32,613
Pay up!

260
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:36,117
Next one.
Move!

261
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:43,691
Murugesha...

262
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:45,159
Sir..

263
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,961
Karuppan.

264
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,160
Azhakan.

265
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:55,263
Go! Get going!

266
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,471
Give me some more time, master.

267
00:17:57,495 --> 00:17:59,172
More time?
- I can't now.

268
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:00,732
Please show some mercy.
- Malia",

269
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:02,072
beat up this rascal.

270
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:03,111
Sir..
Tell him!

271
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,372
No, sir..

272
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:07,280
The sugar canes have all
dried up in the summer.

273
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:09,215
There is no income.

274
00:18:09,306 --> 00:18:11,585
No more women left for
your Landlord... to devour.

275
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:13,145
How will we pay UP?

276
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,187
Hit him!

277
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:15,747
Shameless fellow.

278
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:18,492
Sir.. Please tell them...

279
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:20,427
Uncle! Uncle!

280
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:21,629
Uncle!

281
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:23,356
Murugesha...

282
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,062
calm down.

283
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:28,635
I'm here, right? I'll go
inside and talk to the Landlord.

284
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,638
Take care of your uncle.

285
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,264
Brother!

286
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,400
Leave him.

287
00:18:34,465 --> 00:18:36,445
I'll go inside and
talk to the Landlord.

288
00:18:37,802 --> 00:18:40,013
Brother, please tell him.

289
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,448
Hey! Stop it.

290
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:49,783
<i>Kammaran Nambiar, son
of Vishwambharan.</i>

291
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,720
Say son of Physician
Vishwambharan.

292
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:55,460
You haven't paid your due for the
past 2 months, physician Kammaran!

293
00:18:56,087 --> 00:18:57,698
I'll give it, sir.
Keep this for now.

294
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:58,799
Rest I'll give later.

295
00:18:58,823 --> 00:19:00,234
This is what you always say.

296
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:01,803
I want to meet master.

297
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:03,604
Is it Aphrodisiac?

298
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:05,106
No.
- Then?

299
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:06,641
It's a lot more potent!

300
00:19:06,831 --> 00:19:09,243
Kammarodisiac.

301
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:21,656
Master"

302
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:26,687
That mad Saheb of yours who's under the
spell of Indians, what's he saying?

303
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:30,824
Nothing special, Master.

304
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:34,496
Some terrorists have
landed, apparently.

305
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:39,607
Here.

306
00:19:40,498 --> 00:19:42,808
Neem leaves from Ezhimala
were necessary for this.

307
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:46,342
Only then it will affect the
nerves that 'need to rise'.

308
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:49,845
It took some time to find
gold-dust and sandalwood.

309
00:19:49,907 --> 00:19:51,477
That's why there was a delay.

310
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:59,591
<i>Conga“ Saheb is quite anxious.</i>

311
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:04,565
And,

312
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:07,699
I heard that a new Collector
is coming to Pavanagudi.

313
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:11,169
The talk in the town is that
he is really troublesome.

314
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:13,374
Why?

315
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:15,541
Is it a re-su rvey or what?

316
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:16,844
No.

317
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:18,339
Didn't I tell you?

318
00:20:18,602 --> 00:20:19,740
Terrorists!

319
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:23,813
I heard that they came
here after quitting the INA.

320
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:27,346
No one knows where
their hide-out is.

321
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:29,652
Must be to catch them.

322
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:33,494
Here.

323
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:35,824
I got this from Saheb's pocket.

324
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,490
It's in English.

325
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:40,225
I have to keep it back there.

326
00:20:42,526 --> 00:20:43,770
There's a letter, sir.

327
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:44,772
Okay. I'll give it.

328
00:20:46,597 --> 00:20:48,408
Saheb and Madam...

329
00:20:48,432 --> 00:20:49,740
Th...There is a letter, Master.

330
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,648
Here.

331
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:57,785
It's Othenan's letter.

332
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:00,153
For his grandmother.

333
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:01,589
Give it.

334
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:03,650
Pattar,

335
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:05,450
BhanumathL.
- Who's the letter for?

336
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:07,629
It's for Malayil Amma.
Give it to her.

337
00:21:21,665 --> 00:21:22,643
My Lord,

338
00:21:23,968 --> 00:21:26,608
I've been paying the interest and
capital for a longtime now.

339
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:30,350
If I could get the title deed
document of my house back"

340
00:21:37,348 --> 00:21:38,326
Okay.

341
00:21:43,454 --> 00:21:44,797
Kammaran sir..

342
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:47,199
Please talk to Lord Kelu.

343
00:21:50,294 --> 00:21:52,433
There's no one other than
you to help us, sir.

344
00:21:52,496 --> 00:21:53,474
Master...

345
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,302
these people are
struggling so much!

346
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,772
Please do something
for them, Master.

347
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:01,008
Hey!
- Yes..

348
00:22:01,338 --> 00:22:02,316
Close that door.

349
00:22:02,673 --> 00:22:03,651
Okay.

350
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:07,211
Tell him that we will pay the
full amount next time, sir.

351
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:13,625
Who the hell are you to
appeal for these bloody pigs?

352
00:22:14,785 --> 00:22:17,732
First you pay the interest for the
interest; then pay the interest.

353
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,030
We'll talk about the
capital after that.

354
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:24,000
Bloody Nambiar, who chews
the Saheb's jaggery.

355
00:22:24,795 --> 00:22:26,832
Get lost, you dog!

356
00:22:27,465 --> 00:22:29,445
Go and give medicines
to my mother.

357
00:22:30,668 --> 00:22:31,840
Then shall I?

358
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:36,384
Sir...

359
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,480
Thank you so much sir.

360
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:44,359
You will be blessed
abundantly, sir.

361
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:51,661
Kammaretta, did you get it?

362
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:57,039
It's first class saffron powder.

363
00:22:57,428 --> 00:22:59,430
Have it with skimmed milk.

364
00:22:59,697 --> 00:23:01,802
Now you're as bright as gold...

365
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,505
Once you have this, you
will shine like a diamond!

366
00:23:14,078 --> 00:23:15,648
What's in the letter?

367
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:17,350
Nothing.
Come.

368
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:20,060
Othenettan's small talk
with grandmother.

369
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,628
Is Othenan planning
to come anytime soon?

370
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:28,393
To stay for so many
years in England...

371
00:23:28,526 --> 00:23:29,504
Bhanu...

372
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:31,439
Grandmother"

373
00:23:31,996 --> 00:23:33,440
<i>Kammarettan.</i>

374
00:23:33,464 --> 00:23:34,670
Malayil Am ma..

375
00:23:34,732 --> 00:23:35,904
Look who's here!

376
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:39,813
Kammaretta, Gandhiji is
coming to Madurai apparently.

377
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:41,612
To the Meenakshi temple.
- Huh?

378
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:42,817
To Madurai?

379
00:23:43,107 --> 00:23:44,552
Gandhiji?
- Yes.

380
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:47,784
Didn't the old man
leave last time,

381
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:50,924
saying that the lower castes should
be allowed to enter the temple,

382
00:23:50,948 --> 00:23:53,394
and that he won't set foot
there until they do that?

383
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:54,428
That's what.

384
00:23:54,452 --> 00:23:57,399
But now, "Harijans" are going to
be allowed inside the temple"

385
00:23:58,389 --> 00:23:59,766
Did you see this?

386
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,436
English?
- Pattar brought it from town.

387
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,939
No photo?
- Yes. Here.

388
00:24:04,395 --> 00:24:05,430
There's a photo!

389
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:07,341
Then it must be true!

390
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:08,942
Oh my Gandhiji!

391
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:10,809
You don't like Gandhiji?

392
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:12,809
I like him ..

393
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:14,746
But I'm a follower of Netaji.

394
00:24:15,673 --> 00:24:17,118
Why so, Kammaran?

395
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:19,079
Well" Malayil Amma...

396
00:24:19,477 --> 00:24:22,789
when you say Gandhiji,
there's this...,

397
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:25,826
but when you say
Netaji, there's this...

398
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,828
Not just that...

399
00:24:27,151 --> 00:24:28,630
Do you know?

400
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,430
Netaji is a Nam biarl!

401
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:31,432
Nam biar...!?

402
00:24:32,123 --> 00:24:34,797
Isn't Netaji a Bengali, you idiot?

403
00:24:36,827 --> 00:24:37,805
Yes... But...

404
00:24:37,962 --> 00:24:40,966
The Nambiars in Bengal
are called 'Bose'.

405
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:42,577
They belong to the upper-caste!

406
00:24:54,979 --> 00:24:56,458
Salutes, sir.

407
00:24:57,415 --> 00:24:58,393
Sir..

408
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,987
Go and shit inside
your house, kiddo.

409
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:04,428
Sir..
-Are you doing good?

410
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:05,699
Medicines for the pain?

411
00:25:05,723 --> 00:25:07,430
I'll bring the medicine
in the morning.

412
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:09,763
Keep waiting for it.

413
00:25:09,894 --> 00:25:12,170
Sheesh. These kids don't even bathe!

414
00:25:13,464 --> 00:25:15,642
You know how long I've been
sitting here, brother?

415
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:17,811
It's been 3 days since I
washed Bhanu Chechi's clothes.

416
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:19,781
I thought I'll take it
to Lord Ke
u's house..

417
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,848
Take it there?

418
00:25:21,806 --> 00:25:22,784
Will you go and give it?

419
00:25:23,074 --> 00:25:25,111
He is a women-eater.

420
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:28,782
If you ever land in front of him,
I myself will kill you.

421
00:25:28,846 --> 00:25:30,792
Bhanu Chechi is always
in front of him, right?

422
00:25:30,848 --> 00:25:32,418
She is his own blood.

423
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:33,990
He won't touch her.

424
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:35,662
You are not like that.

425
00:25:36,153 --> 00:25:37,655
We were born as slaves.

426
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,199
She wants to take
it there, it seems.

427
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,836
Go and give it to Aunt Gomathy.

428
00:25:46,264 --> 00:25:47,242
Kiddo...

429
00:25:47,898 --> 00:25:50,105
The leaves for Aunt Gomathy's
medicines are over.

430
00:25:50,768 --> 00:25:53,772
Tell her that I'll make it once I
pluck them from the deep forest.

431
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:54,848
Oh! Right!

432
00:25:54,872 --> 00:25:57,944
This deep forest is some English
medicine shop in the town, right?

433
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:02,222
Aunt Gomathy says that you
have the same skill as father.

434
00:26:02,246 --> 00:26:03,520
Only I know the truth..

435
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:08,263
Kiddo..

436
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,556
It's getting dark"

437
00:26:10,955 --> 00:26:12,901
Go via Thi
akan's shop.

438
00:26:13,224 --> 00:26:14,567
Don't take the short cut.

439
00:26:14,725 --> 00:26:16,068
Okay, "Kiddo"!

440
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:17,636
What's happening there?

441
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:19,941
Can't trust these guys!

442
00:26:20,598 --> 00:26:22,009
Bloody scoundrels".

443
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:25,577
Yapping all the time..

444
00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:28,681
This place will be clean only
if they are all burnt down.

445
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:32,949
Most of the officers appointed to the
police station in Amruthasamudram,

446
00:26:33,077 --> 00:26:36,889
were Inspectors sent there
on punishment transfers.

447
00:26:37,548 --> 00:26:40,688
To complaint against Kelu Nambiar",

448
00:26:40,751 --> 00:26:42,229
one had to go meet...

449
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:47,760
Robert S. Coogan, who was called
'Mad Saheb' by the Tamilians.

450
00:26:48,225 --> 00:26:53,004
The fanatic craze that Saheb
had towards Indian arts...,

451
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:56,634
was much more than what the
British Government",

452
00:26:56,867 --> 00:27:01,816
or even his wife,
Madam Irene could tolerate.

453
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:08,115
As Malaria claimed her dear
son's life <i>at</i> Amruthasamudram",

454
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,782
she hated that village.

455
00:27:11,248 --> 00:27:15,856
She kept venting out that
anger against Saheb.

456
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:18,530
Madam, please tell him..

457
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:23,269
They broke my back, sir.
Madam, please...

458
00:27:33,137 --> 00:27:36,118
- Kammaran sir, please tell the Inspector"
- Leave them , brother.

459
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:38,318
What are they doing?

460
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:43,289
Saheb"
- Hey Kammaran!

461
00:27:44,815 --> 00:27:46,795
What you asked for, yesterday...

462
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:52,357
I brought it from Pavanagudi.

463
00:27:53,858 --> 00:27:56,964
What's your "Lord Ke
u" saying?

464
00:28:00,698 --> 00:28:03,702
Some nonsense about you, Saheb.

465
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:04,971
I feel ashamed to tell you.

466
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:06,207
Come on.
Tell me.

467
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:07,882
Well",

468
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:09,718
he is saying...

469
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:12,213
that your father...

470
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,288
Daddy!

471
00:28:14,912 --> 00:28:17,017
He's saying that your daddy
was some crazy Tamilian.

472
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:20,890
And that's why you're listening
to these Tamil songs.

473
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:26,733
Bloody Indians.

474
00:28:26,757 --> 00:28:29,703
What do we do now?

475
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:31,331
Just give him this medicine.

476
00:28:31,395 --> 00:28:32,874
Mother, hold this.

477
00:28:34,365 --> 00:28:35,609
Murugesha...

478
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:39,206
apply this all over your uncle's body.
- Okay sir.

479
00:28:39,337 --> 00:28:41,146
The leaves were brought
from Ezhimalai.

480
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:42,875
It's a little expensive.

481
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:49,280
This is all I have, sir.

482
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:52,656
This is not enough.
But it's okay.

483
00:28:54,085 --> 00:28:55,155
Don't cry..

484
00:28:56,754 --> 00:28:58,028
Murugeshan, come..

485
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:02,865
Come fast.
- Coming, sir.

486
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,439
Murugesha...
- Tell me, sir.

487
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:06,740
Need to tell you something.

488
00:29:06,764 --> 00:29:10,944
That Kelu molested
your sister, right?

489
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:12,038
Yes sir..

490
00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:15,447
To avenge that and this...

491
00:29:15,673 --> 00:29:17,718
I will give you a chance.

492
00:29:17,742 --> 00:29:21,155
Sir.. If you give me such a chance,
I'll forever be indebted to you!

493
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:22,417
<i>Kammaretta"</i>

494
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,717
Thilakan?
- Everything is over, Kammaretta.

495
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:26,886
This is the latest news.

496
00:29:27,018 --> 00:29:28,258
Hitler is dead!

497
00:29:29,987 --> 00:29:31,898
I heard this yesterday itself.

498
00:29:32,723 --> 00:29:33,997
He was hung to death, right?
- No.

499
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:35,766
Didn't he shoot himself?

500
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:39,334
He must have shot
himself while hanging"

501
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,966
Then why didn't you tell me?

502
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:45,041
I didn't want to make you
sad by letting you know.

503
00:29:45,936 --> 00:29:48,746
In a way, it's good that Hitler died.

504
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:53,281
Do you know what Coogan
Saheb says about Hitler?

505
00:29:53,778 --> 00:29:55,815
If Britishers are pigs,

506
00:29:56,113 --> 00:29:58,218
Hitler is a wild bull.

507
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:00,260
He will keep blabbering like that.
Mad Saheb.

508
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:03,127
No man is alive, to avenge us.

509
00:30:03,754 --> 00:30:04,732
No one!

510
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,768
There is!

511
00:30:06,824 --> 00:30:07,802
Who?

512
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:11,840
The Japanese!

513
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:12,907
Japanese?

514
00:30:13,164 --> 00:30:14,142
Have you..

515
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:17,144
Have you seen their eyes?

516
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:21,981
One look at their eyes, and you
know they were born to win.

517
00:30:22,873 --> 00:30:23,851
True.

518
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:28,413
So that's why you're saving
up Japanese currency?

519
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:34,327
Bhanu Edathi, how is
Malayil Am ma now?

520
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:36,092
The suffocation to
breathe has gone down.

521
00:30:36,187 --> 00:30:38,133
She is on sedation from
all those medicines now.

522
00:30:38,856 --> 00:30:41,132
Is Kammaran at home?
- No.

523
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:44,167
Kammarettan has more work during
the night, Aunt Gomathy.

524
00:30:44,362 --> 00:30:47,935
He says that only the leaves plucked
during full moon can abate diseases.

525
00:30:48,032 --> 00:30:50,308
If he has said that,
it must be true.

526
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:53,515
The oil to apply
on my leg is over.

527
00:30:53,904 --> 00:30:55,406
He never forgets that.

528
00:30:55,873 --> 00:30:57,045
Don't know what happened.

529
00:30:57,341 --> 00:30:59,184
The pain starts immediately
when that's stopped.

530
00:30:59,243 --> 00:31:00,278
Sigh!
Forgot that.

531
00:31:00,344 --> 00:31:02,889
Those leaves can be found only
in the forest within the hill.

532
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:04,358
He couldn't get it
when he went there.

533
00:31:05,783 --> 00:31:07,456
Aunt Gomathy, I'm leaving.

534
00:31:07,585 --> 00:31:09,196
Kammarettan had come
there yesterday.

535
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,099
A Tami
ian's life was saved only
because Kammarettan intervened.

536
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:14,425
There's no one else to
save those hapless souls.

537
00:31:14,492 --> 00:31:18,030
Only he is there if we need
something, in this damned village.

538
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,567
I'm thinking of getting
you married to him.

539
00:31:24,035 --> 00:31:26,246
There will be someone to take
care of the house as well.

540
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,414
Kammarettan?

541
00:31:27,438 --> 00:31:29,247
Kammarettan is an
innocent chap, mother.

542
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:31,086
Very naive.

543
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:14,024
'Was it me, or the night, that came
swimming across the darkness?'

544
00:32:15,953 --> 00:32:23,201
'And waited far away, unseen'

545
00:32:25,096 --> 00:32:30,177
'Like a wind, like a rain...
came to your window sill'

546
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:34,980
'By your side...
just to get a glance of you'

547
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,579
'Oh Krishna... The dark Lord'

548
00:32:39,644 --> 00:32:44,423
'Come to me, with a shower of
your sweet tunes from the Bansuri'

549
00:32:44,482 --> 00:32:49,124
'Oh Krishna... The dark Lord'

550
00:32:49,186 --> 00:32:53,657
'The Bansuri playing, blue eyed one'

551
00:32:53,924 --> 00:33:00,102
'Was it me, or the night, that came
swimming across the darkness?'

552
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:11,045
'And waited far away, unseen'

553
00:33:41,372 --> 00:33:46,549
'The silky umbrella of
sunshine opens in the morning'

554
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:51,321
'In the drizzle at night,
bangles jiggle and smiles bloom'

555
00:33:51,382 --> 00:33:56,063
'A face like a pure stream'

556
00:33:56,087 --> 00:34:00,035
'Through the window sill'

557
00:34:00,157 --> 00:34:02,159
'I caught a glance of it'

558
00:34:02,226 --> 00:34:10,077
'I drowned in the beauty that
flows through it... like a cloud'

559
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:14,550
'Oh Krishna... The dark Lord'

560
00:34:14,605 --> 00:34:19,386
'The Bansuri playing, blue eyed one'

561
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:27,124
'Was it me, or the night, that came
swimming across the darkness?'

562
00:34:29,086 --> 00:34:34,695
'And waited far away, unseen'

563
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:07,365
'As the sugar canes are filled with honey, the
harvest season is here, the mind awakens'

564
00:35:07,425 --> 00:35:12,135
'Sounds of birds chirping
on the scattered grains'

565
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:16,702
'I wandered many a time'

566
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:21,014
'Where do you disappear?'

567
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:23,279
'A lifetime is not enough'

568
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:27,721
'I keep searching for
many paths to reach you'

569
00:35:27,778 --> 00:35:30,725
'Like a burning ember'

570
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:35,389
'Oh Krishna... The dark Lord'

571
00:35:35,486 --> 00:35:41,232
'The Bansuri playing, blue eyed one'

572
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:48,470
Sir, he created a lot of trouble when we
went to hunt for women from his house.

573
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:49,644
Come here.

574
00:35:51,202 --> 00:35:52,681
This land is mine...

575
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,545
Yourwoman is also mine!

576
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:55,717
Understood?

577
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:02,480
Who is it?

578
00:36:04,348 --> 00:36:05,656
Who is it?
Go check!

579
00:36:05,716 --> 00:36:07,828
Terrorists are hiding
and attacking. Run!

580
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:08,830
Run!

581
00:36:11,322 --> 00:36:13,359
Master!
Master!

582
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:16,497
Master! Don't go!

583
00:36:59,904 --> 00:37:01,383
Maheshwari"!!!

584
00:38:45,443 --> 00:38:46,421
Othenan"!!!

585
00:39:36,861 --> 00:39:39,501
You must have gone for your night
stroll at the sugar cane field.

586
00:39:43,701 --> 00:39:45,578
What is it, brother?
What happened?

587
00:39:47,438 --> 00:39:49,042
Kerosene is over.

588
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,679
When you buy it for the Saheb,
buy a little for us too.

589
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,093
Blood!
How did this happen?

590
00:40:02,553 --> 00:40:03,531
Show it.

591
00:40:03,688 --> 00:40:04,723
I said no!

592
00:40:06,123 --> 00:40:09,400
You never listen when I tell you to take
a torch while going for night walks.

593
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:11,702
Why do you want to
make me anxious?

594
00:40:14,432 --> 00:40:15,410
Keep it here.

595
00:40:17,568 --> 00:40:19,411
I'm just tying it with a cloth.
Don't worry.

596
00:40:19,637 --> 00:40:21,378
I won't apply any
of your medicines.

597
00:40:25,943 --> 00:40:29,390
Bhanu Edathi &Aunt Gomathy have
only nice things to say about you.

598
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:32,025
But they don't know about
this habit of yours!

599
00:40:59,043 --> 00:41:00,147
Stopped having your gruel?

600
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:03,626
Why can't you tell me if there are
stones in it? Won't I throw them away?

601
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:05,623
Who am I making all this for?

602
00:41:50,027 --> 00:41:51,836
Why did you want to meet me?

603
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:56,170
Othenettan is here.

604
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:01,049
He asked me not to tell anyone.

605
00:42:01,872 --> 00:42:03,681
But if I don't say this now,

606
00:42:03,808 --> 00:42:05,185
Othenettan will be in danger.

607
00:42:05,977 --> 00:42:07,854
I can't say this to anyone else.

608
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,555
He's not the same person
who left from here.

609
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:13,121
He has changed completely.

610
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,699
Bhanu...,

611
00:42:18,823 --> 00:42:20,097
did he come to meet you?

612
00:42:21,025 --> 00:42:22,003
No!

613
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:33,071
You always liked him, right?

614
00:42:35,273 --> 00:42:36,251
I mean...

615
00:42:36,607 --> 00:42:40,054
Between you both...

616
00:42:47,018 --> 00:42:49,191
You should meet him
and talk to him.

617
00:42:50,254 --> 00:42:53,098
He's talking about freedom,
revolution and all sorts of things.

618
00:42:54,158 --> 00:42:56,236
You should convince him to
have a change of heart.

619
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,830
This is not just my necessity.

620
00:42:58,663 --> 00:42:59,869
Grandmother is also worried.

621
00:43:02,967 --> 00:43:06,073
Without knowing where
he is, how can I?

622
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:07,548
<i>Kammaretta"</i>

623
00:43:14,111 --> 00:43:16,682
To the east of Traitor's Hill,
there's a wild stream.

624
00:43:18,082 --> 00:43:19,959
He said that it flows
to the river Kabani.

625
00:43:20,284 --> 00:43:22,264
It's somewhere along the
shore of that stream.

626
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,730
Along with him, there are
armed outsiders, apparently.

627
00:43:31,863 --> 00:43:33,274
What happened to your leg?

628
00:43:37,234 --> 00:43:40,215
An old wound!

629
00:43:41,305 --> 00:43:45,276
It has opened up, againm!

630
00:43:51,148 --> 00:43:52,684
<i>Kamala"
- Yes.</i>

631
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:55,094
Where's my purse
that was in here?

632
00:43:56,087 --> 00:43:57,088
What is it, brother?

633
00:43:59,023 --> 00:44:00,001
Got it.

634
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:03,305
Why are you buying this Japanese
currency paying such a high price?

635
00:44:03,828 --> 00:44:05,808
Thilakan Chettan told
me that Hitler is dead.

636
00:44:06,564 --> 00:44:07,975
Thilakan Chettan!

637
00:44:08,766 --> 00:44:09,836
Just call him by his name!

638
00:44:11,002 --> 00:44:12,538
All he has is that fairness!

639
00:44:14,138 --> 00:44:15,674
Do you know which
caste he belongs to?

640
00:44:16,574 --> 00:44:17,552
It's that one!

641
00:44:23,247 --> 00:44:25,826
I have to climb Traitor's Hill
tomorrow morning.

642
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,261
The leaves for the
medicines are over.

643
00:44:27,918 --> 00:44:29,090
Let me go to sleep early.

644
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:30,331
<i>Kamah,</i>

645
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,135
Only Hitler is dead.

646
00:44:34,992 --> 00:44:38,906
The Japanese are still
dropping bombs like mustard seeds...

647
00:44:39,297 --> 00:44:41,709
You know what?
Huge bombs!

648
00:44:43,067 --> 00:44:46,014
In the war, the British would
lose to the Japanese.

649
00:44:46,404 --> 00:44:49,146
Then, India would be
under Japan's rule.

650
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,185
All the bosses here including Kelu,

651
00:44:53,244 --> 00:44:55,190
and the Sahebs...
would be destroyed.

652
00:44:56,881 --> 00:45:00,328
Then there would only be Kammaran,
the Japanese and their currency.

653
00:45:01,852 --> 00:45:04,059
And then, I'll walk with
my head held high.

654
00:45:04,689 --> 00:45:07,401
Walking is fine!
But take care of your leg.

655
00:45:07,425 --> 00:45:09,063
Okay.
Go to sleep, Kiddo.

656
00:45:15,266 --> 00:45:18,611
We've captured two spies
in the jungle area.

657
00:45:19,136 --> 00:45:21,116
So our camp should stay alert.

658
00:45:21,405 --> 00:45:23,282
And be ready for any situation.

659
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,154
Brother, I've brought that dog.
He was running away.

660
00:45:34,251 --> 00:45:36,231
But we captured him.
What do we do with him?

661
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:38,723
Take him away, question him;
ask him why he did it.

662
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,268
How he did it...

663
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,034
And on whose command.

664
00:45:45,196 --> 00:45:46,174
Done, brother.

665
00:45:47,765 --> 00:45:49,108
Take this traitor away!

666
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,211
Question him thoroughly!
- Yes sir.

667
00:45:52,003 --> 00:45:52,981
Come on! Move!

668
00:45:53,237 --> 00:45:54,215
Forward!

669
00:45:55,106 --> 00:45:56,312
There are two more people.

670
00:45:57,008 --> 00:45:58,282
They came climbing the hills;

671
00:45:58,843 --> 00:46:00,322
Looks like they are
from this locality.

672
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:02,915
I have a doubt on them.

673
00:46:03,981 --> 00:46:04,959
What do we do?

674
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:06,728
Bring them.
- Okay.

675
00:46:06,884 --> 00:46:08,022
Bring them both!

676
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:10,964
We came looking for medicines to
increase Malayil Am ma's eyesight;

677
00:46:10,988 --> 00:46:12,797
and now we've lost our eyesight.

678
00:46:13,891 --> 00:46:14,926
Come here, you..

679
00:46:16,294 --> 00:46:17,904
Where are they taking us?
- Careful!

680
00:46:17,928 --> 00:46:18,906
Come on!

681
00:46:18,963 --> 00:46:20,135
You come this way.

682
00:46:25,002 --> 00:46:25,980
Open it.

683
00:46:30,908 --> 00:46:32,387
Kammaretta, it's Othenan.

684
00:46:35,146 --> 00:46:36,853
These are my people, Satnam.

685
00:46:37,415 --> 00:46:38,758
My Very own.

686
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:42,697
Okay brother.

687
00:46:53,965 --> 00:46:58,505
Inspector Saheb suspects that there are
INA members somewhere in this hill.

688
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:01,443
Many in the town also
know about this now.

689
00:47:01,906 --> 00:47:03,476
That we are here?
- No.

690
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:05,379
Then how did you know?

691
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:07,889
Be careful with the fire.

692
00:47:08,512 --> 00:47:09,991
It can be seen from the fields.

693
00:47:10,114 --> 00:47:12,253
So you came to check,
seeing the fire?

694
00:47:14,118 --> 00:47:15,859
Satnam!
- Sorry brother.

695
00:47:16,287 --> 00:47:17,425
Physician Vishwambharan?

696
00:47:19,123 --> 00:47:20,101
He's no more.

697
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:27,307
Do you remember my
father, Othenan?

698
00:47:27,465 --> 00:47:28,443
A faint memory.

699
00:47:29,467 --> 00:47:32,914
When I was little, I was bit
by a scorpion here once.

700
00:47:33,404 --> 00:47:34,906
None of the English
medicines worked.

701
00:47:35,406 --> 00:47:36,976
It was his medicine
that healed me.

702
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,851
How did he die?

703
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:45,518
My mother had a very
serious illness.

704
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,995
For her treatment,

705
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:50,261
our house and field
were mortgaged.

706
00:47:51,389 --> 00:47:52,527
To Lord Kelu...

707
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:55,336
Father!

708
00:47:55,393 --> 00:47:58,340
When he couldn't pay the
interest two consecutive times..,

709
00:47:58,396 --> 00:48:00,000
as the Tamilians stood watching...

710
00:48:00,064 --> 00:48:02,066
Lord Kelu spat at my father.

711
00:48:03,601 --> 00:48:05,239
That hurt him deeply.

712
00:48:06,437 --> 00:48:10,510
The next day, he took me and
my sister to Pavanagudi town,

713
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:12,582
and bought everything
we wanted to eat.

714
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:14,179
Then"

715
00:48:14,545 --> 00:48:16,388
he dropped us back
home and told us,

716
00:48:17,014 --> 00:48:18,425
Look after your
mother and sister.

717
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:21,897
I will go meet
Lord Kelu once more and come.

718
00:48:22,086 --> 00:48:23,064
Eat...

719
00:48:24,155 --> 00:48:25,225
Did he die,

720
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,060
or was he killed?
I don't know!

721
00:48:29,927 --> 00:48:31,235
He was found in the river Kabani.

722
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:34,538
In the river Kabani.

723
00:48:43,608 --> 00:48:46,145
Othenan, we are also with you.
Right, Kammaretta?

724
00:48:47,078 --> 00:48:50,150
Kammarettan is very close to
the Inspector Saheb here.

725
00:48:50,348 --> 00:48:52,350
Kammarettan will pass on
information about them.

726
00:48:56,454 --> 00:48:57,432
<i>Kammaretta‘.!</i>

727
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:00,164
Oh my God!
Othenan!

728
00:49:00,224 --> 00:49:02,363
This is the punishment
for traitors.

729
00:49:14,372 --> 00:49:16,079
The Japanese will
fight from outside...

730
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,944
We will fight from
within the country...

731
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:20,352
Then these white rats
would be helpless.

732
00:49:20,578 --> 00:49:22,319
And thus, our country would be free.

733
00:49:22,947 --> 00:49:24,858
So the news hasn't
reached here?

734
00:49:25,149 --> 00:49:26,126
What news?

735
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:27,857
The Japanese lost in the war.

736
00:49:28,986 --> 00:49:29,964
H...How...!!??

737
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:31,532
Atom bomb.

738
00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:34,001
At Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

739
00:49:35,493 --> 00:49:36,471
Japan surrendered.

740
00:49:37,328 --> 00:49:39,535
Didn't Kammarettan say that
they had huge bombs with them?

741
00:49:40,498 --> 00:49:42,444
Having is not... detonating!

742
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,943
Smart men did it
before they could!

743
00:49:49,207 --> 00:49:50,185
What is it, brother?

744
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:53,145
Everything is over, dear.

745
00:49:55,379 --> 00:49:56,357
What happened?

746
00:49:57,381 --> 00:49:58,689
<i>hast!</i>

747
00:49:58,983 --> 00:50:00,462
Who?
The Japanese?

748
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:02,120
No.

749
00:50:02,186 --> 00:50:03,163
Me!

750
00:50:03,187 --> 00:50:04,325
This Kammaran Nambiar!

751
00:50:05,623 --> 00:50:06,966
Japanese, it seems!

752
00:50:07,525 --> 00:50:10,267
One look at their eyes, and you
know that they were born to lose.

753
00:50:10,461 --> 00:50:11,439
Bloody dogs!

754
00:50:13,965 --> 00:50:20,405
When America bombed Japan, it wasn't
just my dream, that was shattered.

755
00:50:21,172 --> 00:50:24,176
It was Coogan Saheb's life as well.

756
00:50:24,442 --> 00:50:27,020
Even though Saheb said
that Britain won the war,

757
00:50:27,044 --> 00:50:31,049
and that they would be
able to go back soon...

758
00:50:31,449 --> 00:50:33,520
Madam didn't believe him.

759
00:50:33,751 --> 00:50:40,134
Scared that the next transfer
would be to an even more terrible place,

760
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:44,196
she left Coogan and left
the country forever.

761
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,344
Madam, I'll take it.

762
00:50:50,368 --> 00:50:52,012
Back off, you bloody Indian!

763
00:50:52,036 --> 00:50:53,014
So be it.

764
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:05,286
Saheb,

765
00:51:07,451 --> 00:51:09,192
While leaving...,

766
00:51:09,754 --> 00:51:12,496
what did Madam show
with her finger?

767
00:51:20,131 --> 00:51:21,109
Thank you.

768
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,076
I should learn everything
in English, like this.

769
00:51:30,508 --> 00:51:32,044
If I die..,

770
00:51:33,444 --> 00:51:37,551
only you are there
for Gomathy and her.

771
00:51:37,748 --> 00:51:39,694
She's your bride-to-be,
according to our custom.

772
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:44,723
Fighting for the
country is good...

773
00:51:45,656 --> 00:51:46,634
But..

774
00:51:47,258 --> 00:51:49,329
you should remember
this as well.

775
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,074
Othenan!

776
00:51:59,136 --> 00:52:02,049
You should give me a word.

777
00:52:04,809 --> 00:52:06,117
What is it, grandmother?

778
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,622
Don't do anything to Kelu.

779
00:52:09,714 --> 00:52:12,217
It's only after your
mother's death,

780
00:52:12,483 --> 00:52:15,464
that he turned into
such a terrible person.

781
00:52:16,587 --> 00:52:19,295
How do you think
that mother died?

782
00:52:21,826 --> 00:52:22,804
He killed her.

783
00:52:23,794 --> 00:52:25,774
Promise me!

784
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:32,507
Othenan!

785
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:00,108
Bhanu...

786
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:03,304
loving one's woman,

787
00:53:04,402 --> 00:53:06,814
does not mean forgetting the
love towards one's own mother.

788
00:53:08,739 --> 00:53:09,740
This country is..

789
00:53:10,741 --> 00:53:11,879
my mother now.

790
00:53:16,847 --> 00:53:17,882
I will come.

791
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:20,226
To take you along with me.

792
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:22,296
But...

793
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,797
Tonight is not that night.

794
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:29,536
Today, there's only one
thing on my mind.

795
00:53:32,396 --> 00:53:33,500
My mother.,!!

796
00:53:58,189 --> 00:53:59,896
Didn't you go to study
in England, Othenan?

797
00:54:00,525 --> 00:54:01,503
Then how did this happen?

798
00:54:01,759 --> 00:54:03,932
I had set out to go to England.

799
00:54:05,429 --> 00:54:06,908
When I reached Bombay",

800
00:54:07,431 --> 00:54:08,910
the news about the
war broke out.

801
00:54:09,767 --> 00:54:12,145
I was excited to watch a war.

802
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,271
To take part in it.

803
00:54:13,637 --> 00:54:16,777
And during my stay in Bombay itself,
I joined the British Royal Army.

804
00:54:20,411 --> 00:54:24,518
Our platoon was sent first
to the Eastern Front.

805
00:54:27,785 --> 00:54:30,823
65 miles North of Singapore",

806
00:54:32,256 --> 00:54:34,497
in a sudden attack by
the Japanese army...,

807
00:54:34,959 --> 00:54:37,337
they made the British
Indian Army prisoners.

808
00:54:50,808 --> 00:54:53,311
Among the Indian soldiers who
were captured as prisoners...,

809
00:54:53,644 --> 00:54:57,319
they decided to transfer
high ranking officers alone...,

810
00:54:57,515 --> 00:55:00,462
from Singapore to an unknown place.

811
00:56:07,084 --> 00:56:08,392
Unveil the gun.

812
00:56:11,088 --> 00:56:13,864
I said, unveil the gun!

813
00:56:18,796 --> 00:56:20,332
Everything is over.

814
00:56:24,702 --> 00:56:26,511
Prepare the gun!

815
00:56:32,676 --> 00:56:34,553
Prepare the gun!

816
00:56:36,447 --> 00:56:38,825
Fire!

817
00:57:10,948 --> 00:57:12,484
Stop!

818
00:57:28,966 --> 00:57:32,846
We didn't understand the meaning
of that letter, on that day.

819
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:36,614
That letter was to enrol us
Indian soldiers to the lNA..,

820
00:57:36,674 --> 00:57:40,019
and make us fight in the
war against the British.

821
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:43,616
After a week..,

822
00:57:44,115 --> 00:57:46,789
the Japanese took us to
an arena in Singapore.

823
00:57:48,152 --> 00:57:52,430
They told us that a great man from
India would come, to address us.

824
00:57:52,823 --> 00:57:54,097
Namaste.

825
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:57,133
Friends of the war for freedom,

826
00:57:57,428 --> 00:57:58,406
Soldiers,

827
00:57:58,663 --> 00:58:00,074
Brothers and Sisters,

828
00:58:00,698 --> 00:58:03,178
Freedom calls for sacrifice.

829
00:58:10,575 --> 00:58:13,556
You give me blood,
I will give you freedom!

830
00:58:15,012 --> 00:58:18,653
I realized what patriotism was, when
I heard those words on that day.

831
00:58:18,783 --> 00:58:21,423
Hail Netaji!

832
00:58:21,552 --> 00:58:24,761
Wejoined INA fascinated
by Netaji's radiance...,

833
00:58:24,855 --> 00:58:28,462
..to save our own country
from centuries of slavery.

834
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,132
When Indian soldiers themselves
reach the border of our country...,

835
00:58:32,496 --> 00:58:37,036
the numerous Indian soldiers
in the British army would feel guilty",

836
00:58:37,435 --> 00:58:40,781
they would change sides as a
whole group and join the 
NA..,

837
00:58:40,805 --> 00:58:44,947
and thus, a huge battalion
could be marched to Delhi...!

838
00:58:45,142 --> 00:58:46,678
That was what Netaji believed.

839
00:58:47,211 --> 00:58:49,088
But he was wrong.

840
00:58:50,448 --> 00:58:51,449
What we saw there was",

841
00:58:51,549 --> 00:58:54,227
a fierce battle between Indians
who were on the British payroll",

842
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:59,860
and the Indians who were given
new lives as alms by the Japanese.

843
00:59:04,695 --> 00:59:05,833
Wait for sometime, brother.

844
00:59:06,564 --> 00:59:07,838
Let this battle get done...

845
00:59:08,165 --> 00:59:09,143
After that!

846
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,840
Sure, brother.

847
01:00:22,006 --> 01:00:23,781
Move forward!

848
01:00:45,563 --> 01:00:46,541
Forward!

849
01:00:47,698 --> 01:00:49,109
Come on!

850
01:01:32,076 --> 01:01:33,054
Move forward!

851
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:49,695
Glory to the Mother Goddess.

852
01:01:51,062 --> 01:01:52,700
Himanshu, stop!

853
01:02:05,176 --> 01:02:06,780
Himanshu!

854
01:02:12,416 --> 01:02:14,157
Brother!

855
01:02:19,056 --> 01:02:22,902
Vande Mataram.
(I bow down to thee, Mother)

856
01:02:27,698 --> 01:02:29,006
Himanshu"!

857
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,804
Himanshu"!

858
01:02:32,136 --> 01:02:35,083
Brother, stop!

859
01:03:07,338 --> 01:03:08,316
Brother, open your eyes.

860
01:03:09,006 --> 01:03:09,984
Satnam"

861
01:03:12,243 --> 01:03:13,779
Where is Himanshu?

862
01:03:14,178 --> 01:03:15,156
Himanshu?

863
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:19,484
Look over there.

864
01:03:30,194 --> 01:03:31,332
He's my brother!

865
01:03:31,429 --> 01:03:32,737
Don't shoot me!

866
01:03:37,802 --> 01:03:39,980
No, brother!
No!

867
01:03:40,004 --> 01:03:40,607
No!

868
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:46,115
Unable to defeat the
Indian troops of the British...,

869
01:03:47,111 --> 01:03:49,148
when lNA's war front failed",

870
01:03:50,448 --> 01:03:51,984
we understood one thing.

871
01:03:54,118 --> 01:03:56,428
The war for India's freedom...,

872
01:03:57,788 --> 01:04:00,029
should be led from within India.

873
01:04:01,158 --> 01:04:02,933
From Indian minds!

874
01:04:05,062 --> 01:04:07,133
Me and Satnam
wandered endlessly.

875
01:04:08,065 --> 01:04:10,136
Somewhere down the line,
we had an idea in mind.

876
01:04:11,102 --> 01:04:12,080

LP..!

877
01:04:15,439 --> 01:04:16,816
Othenan, you should be careful.

878
01:04:17,008 --> 01:04:19,852
Towards the South, the villagers
themselves tie up INA members to trees..

879
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:22,823
And hand them over to the police
to get rewards; that's what I heard.

880
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:23,992
I know.

881
01:04:24,849 --> 01:04:27,921
I also know that the greatest enemies
of the Indians trying to save India,

882
01:04:28,018 --> 01:04:29,463
are Indians themselves.

883
01:04:31,289 --> 01:04:32,893
I don't want to live long.

884
01:04:33,424 --> 01:04:36,462
But as long as I'm alive,
I don't want my head to bow down!

885
01:04:40,097 --> 01:04:41,576
We have our reasons
for coming here.

886
01:04:42,867 --> 01:04:44,403
I'll tell you that
when the time comes.

887
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:47,513
A true patriot!

888
01:04:47,872 --> 01:04:49,010
Right, Kammarettan?

889
01:04:50,174 --> 01:04:52,920
TheAmruthasamudram branch
of Indian Liberation Party...

890
01:04:52,944 --> 01:04:54,548
We're officially
inaugurating it here today.

891
01:04:54,912 --> 01:04:57,222
You should say the pledge
that I taught you.

892
01:04:58,015 --> 01:04:59,995
Take an oath, by holding your
palm over the flame.

893
01:05:00,151 --> 01:05:01,129
Me first.

894
01:05:03,321 --> 01:05:04,857
I, Thilakan, hereby pledge that,

895
01:05:05,022 --> 01:05:08,196
I am a member of Indian Liberation
Party from this moment onwards...

896
01:05:08,893 --> 01:05:14,468
.. and saving India from enemies within and
outside, is my primary <i>&</i> final duty,

897
01:05:14,899 --> 01:05:17,209
With my hand upon
this burning flame,

898
01:05:17,301 --> 01:05:19,440
I swear!
I swear!

899
01:05:19,904 --> 01:05:21,440
I swear!
Oh my God!

900
01:05:25,142 --> 01:05:26,246
<i>Kammarettan‘.!</i>

901
01:05:34,018 --> 01:05:35,156
Do it confidently, Kammaretta.

902
01:05:35,286 --> 01:05:37,129
I did it, right?
It won't burn.

903
01:05:38,456 --> 01:05:41,198
I have some bad news for you.

904
01:05:43,194 --> 01:05:47,438
It's something that would
make us lose our courage.

905
01:05:48,466 --> 01:05:49,536
That's why.

906
01:05:50,034 --> 01:05:51,445
I didn't say it yet.

907
01:05:51,502 --> 01:05:52,572
What is it?

908
01:05:54,271 --> 01:05:55,249
Our..

909
01:05:56,174 --> 01:05:58,586
Netaji has been killed...!!

910
01:05:59,143 --> 01:06:01,020
In an aeroplane accident.

911
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:10,065
The media has killed Netaji
several times earlier as well.

912
01:06:10,354 --> 01:06:13,665
At times, the news of Netaji's death
was spread with his approval as well.

913
01:06:14,325 --> 01:06:15,633
To hoodwink the British!

914
01:06:18,162 --> 01:06:19,470
This isn't that.

915
01:06:21,032 --> 01:06:23,273
It's a secret information
that Coogan Saheb received.

916
01:06:24,135 --> 01:06:25,671
It never goes wrong.

917
01:06:26,704 --> 01:06:27,910
It's in English.

918
01:06:30,675 --> 01:06:31,881
SIS Document.

919
01:06:44,388 --> 01:06:46,561
Kammaretta, you also
take the oath.

920
01:06:52,363 --> 01:06:53,569
My Netaji..!!

921
01:06:58,102 --> 01:06:59,206
Don't cry.

922
01:07:00,037 --> 01:07:01,243
Othenan is a good man.

923
01:07:03,207 --> 01:07:04,447
Don't cry, dear.

924
01:07:05,143 --> 01:07:07,145
My brother Kelu, is
really fond of you.

925
01:07:07,445 --> 01:07:10,016
He only hates the sight
of me, his sister.

926
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:15,360
Even brother knows that
you are Othenan's girl.

927
01:07:16,754 --> 01:07:18,165
You go along with him.

928
01:07:19,056 --> 01:07:20,034
You will only be blessed.

929
01:07:21,292 --> 01:07:23,272
Don't worry about me.

930
01:07:24,228 --> 01:07:26,299
<i>I have Kammaran and
Kamala</i> here, <i>right?</i>

931
01:07:27,064 --> 01:07:28,042
Get up, dear.

932
01:07:28,399 --> 01:07:29,377
Eat something.

933
01:07:36,374 --> 01:07:40,345
It's a face that has been engraved in
my heart ever since I can remember.

934
01:07:41,145 --> 01:07:44,058
I've longed for her
so much, Selvan Baba...

935
01:07:44,182 --> 01:07:46,560
Whereverl look within me,
I can only find Bhanu.

936
01:07:47,718 --> 01:07:49,197
Just her.

937
01:07:50,388 --> 01:07:51,366
I want her.

938
01:07:51,722 --> 01:07:53,065
Don't cry!

939
01:07:53,157 --> 01:07:54,500
Don't cry.
Let's see.

940
01:07:55,459 --> 01:07:56,437
God!

941
01:07:57,294 --> 01:07:58,272
My dear"

942
01:07:58,629 --> 01:08:00,074
pick a card auspiciously.

943
01:08:07,805 --> 01:08:09,079
You are fortunate!

944
01:08:09,607 --> 01:08:14,022
In this world, only one in
ten thousand gets this card!

945
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:16,057
Look...

946
01:08:16,514 --> 01:08:17,788
<i>Ravanau‘.!</i>

947
01:08:18,115 --> 01:08:21,619
The one who has 10,000 shrewd
ideas in his 10 heads.

948
01:08:21,819 --> 01:08:22,797
Just like you.

949
01:08:25,122 --> 01:08:26,396
You aren't fortunate at all!

950
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:30,603
This girl has another
Lord Sri Ram whom she's waiting for.

951
01:08:30,795 --> 01:08:31,773
Doesn't she?

952
01:08:33,731 --> 01:08:36,644
Don't go there with
your desire for her.

953
01:08:37,234 --> 01:08:38,804
Your Lanka will be burnt to ashes.

954
01:08:40,605 --> 01:08:43,381
Don't use force on any woman.

955
01:08:44,108 --> 01:08:45,678
That's disgraceful!

956
01:08:48,713 --> 01:08:51,319
Isn't there any other way, Baba?
- No.

957
01:08:54,318 --> 01:08:55,558
Wait.

958
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,460
Let's see once more.

959
01:08:59,123 --> 01:09:02,570
Is there any way for
this Ravana to get Sita?

960
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:09,776
I can see a sign!

961
01:09:10,568 --> 01:09:11,546
Here.

962
01:09:12,403 --> 01:09:15,145
Green leaves and fire!

963
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:17,446
What is this?
- Listen carefully.

964
01:09:17,808 --> 01:09:21,381
At midnight, if a bunch of green
leaves burn on their own..,

965
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:22,583
...you will get her..!!

966
01:09:22,813 --> 01:09:25,316
(Tries to repeat)

967
01:09:25,516 --> 01:09:26,494
What was it again?

968
01:09:26,784 --> 01:09:28,161
Come here.

969
01:09:28,352 --> 01:09:32,323
At midnight, if a bunch of green
leaves burn on their own..,

970
01:09:33,124 --> 01:09:34,694
...you will get her..!!

971
01:09:36,494 --> 01:09:38,565
What if I burn them myself?

972
01:09:38,629 --> 01:09:39,607
Get lost!

973
01:09:44,502 --> 01:09:45,480
Brother!

974
01:09:46,671 --> 01:09:48,309
Merchiston is here.

975
01:09:48,806 --> 01:09:50,581
It's time for revenge!

976
01:09:53,311 --> 01:09:54,289
Brother!

977
01:09:57,515 --> 01:09:59,290
Collectorate, "Pavanagudi"

978
01:10:51,269 --> 01:10:53,772
That's when I realized that",

979
01:10:54,172 --> 01:10:57,642
.. Merchiston Saheb had come there thinking
that there's some treasure in the temple,

980
01:10:57,809 --> 01:10:59,914
to loot it.

981
01:11:00,445 --> 01:11:04,188
During Coogan Saheb's initial
days in Amruthasamudram",

982
01:11:04,282 --> 01:11:07,229
to become his close aide
and gain his trust",

983
01:11:07,485 --> 01:11:15,485
I had narrated a lot of both true and false
stories about this village and its people.

984
01:11:16,527 --> 01:11:20,805
One among them, was the story of a
treasure inside the temple in the forest.

985
01:11:22,266 --> 01:11:26,772
I had never even dreamt that this
crazy Saheb would believe it...,

986
01:11:26,838 --> 01:11:29,478
and write it in his book.

987
01:11:30,975 --> 01:11:34,218
A new revelation that he has to return
to his own land and his own woman..,

988
01:11:34,612 --> 01:11:37,923
with his head held high..,

989
01:11:38,483 --> 01:11:42,829
..made Coogan Saheb switch back to his real
persona from the Mad Saheb that he was.

990
01:12:01,672 --> 01:12:04,653
He says that he didn't come here
to sit <i>&</i> chew the betel nut.

991
01:12:27,765 --> 01:12:28,937
What is he saying?

992
01:12:29,067 --> 01:12:32,844
Othenan said that he's
going to study in England",

993
01:12:32,904 --> 01:12:34,713
but joined the INA instead, apparently.

994
01:12:58,963 --> 01:12:59,907
Well".

995
01:13:00,097 --> 01:13:02,976
If you give any information
about Othenan sir...

996
01:13:03,534 --> 01:13:06,037
he has promised a
reward of 1000 Rupees.

997
01:13:08,873 --> 01:13:09,908
Don't shoot!

998
01:13:10,074 --> 01:13:11,052
Come.

999
01:13:11,109 --> 01:13:12,087
Othenan!

1000
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:19,951
<i>Come, Kammaran.</i>

1001
01:13:22,787 --> 01:13:24,494
What is it?
- Othenan"

1002
01:13:24,956 --> 01:13:27,698
I don't know to talk about
revolution like you.

1003
01:13:28,359 --> 01:13:29,394
But I know one thing.

1004
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,407
The best among the
weapons to win a war,

1005
01:13:32,797 --> 01:13:34,504
is not any of the weapons
with you.

1006
01:13:34,732 --> 01:13:39,112
It's a man who has a burning
heart full of vengeance.

1007
01:13:40,505 --> 01:13:41,779
Shall I give you one such person?

1008
01:13:43,508 --> 01:13:44,543
Murugesha...

1009
01:13:44,609 --> 01:13:45,679
Coming.

1010
01:13:46,644 --> 01:13:48,317
Tell him.
- Give me a chance, sir.

1011
01:13:48,412 --> 01:13:49,914
I'll fall at yourfeet, sir.

1012
01:13:50,781 --> 01:13:52,092
Just one chance, sir.

1013
01:13:52,116 --> 01:13:53,652
Just one chance, sir!

1014
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:07,776
Tomorrow morning,
11.30 AM...

1015
01:14:07,832 --> 01:14:09,903
The south entrance of the Collectorate"
- Wait.

1016
01:14:10,535 --> 01:14:11,570
There's a problem.

1017
01:14:13,137 --> 01:14:14,115
What problem?

1018
01:14:14,672 --> 01:14:18,779
Merchiston Saheb will reach
Am ruthasamudram after dark tomorrow.

1019
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:20,116
The temple is his target.

1020
01:14:20,778 --> 01:14:23,088
For that, Coogan Saheb will make
the necessary arrangements.

1021
01:14:23,814 --> 01:14:26,055
To make it a law and order problem",

1022
01:14:26,117 --> 01:14:29,564
Lord Kelu's goons will
attack the Tamil slums.

1023
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:33,097
It's a plan hatched by all three of them.
- What's the proof for this?

1024
01:14:37,562 --> 01:14:38,540
Here.

1025
01:14:39,697 --> 01:14:42,439
This is a book written by Coogan Saheb.

1026
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,771
They have made their
plan based on this book.

1027
01:14:46,638 --> 01:14:47,616
Call Satnam.

1028
01:14:47,972 --> 01:14:49,815
Sir, he has gone out
with the scout team.

1029
01:14:51,709 --> 01:14:53,086
I have to go down
the hill once more.

1030
01:14:53,978 --> 01:14:56,015
I have to ask the
Tamilians to be cautious.

1031
01:14:56,714 --> 01:14:58,421
They have to be shifted elsewhere.

1032
01:14:59,217 --> 01:15:01,857
I would like to
have some weapons.

1033
01:15:02,887 --> 01:15:04,457
Send some weapons with him.

1034
01:15:04,822 --> 01:15:06,166
Sir, I'll also come with you.
- No.

1035
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:07,498
You stay here.

1036
01:15:07,892 --> 01:15:09,997
You and Thilakan
should stay here.

1037
01:15:10,061 --> 01:15:11,039
Okay sir.

1038
01:15:11,562 --> 01:15:15,510
Lord Kelu has some doubts.
That's dangerous.

1039
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:16,838
You stay here.

1040
01:15:17,034 --> 01:15:18,843
Be really cautious.
- Okay sir.

1041
01:15:19,804 --> 01:15:21,750
Kammaretta, be careful.

1042
01:15:27,545 --> 01:15:29,957
Sir, you'll be
blessed abundantly!

1043
01:16:06,884 --> 01:16:08,454
Salutes, sir.

1044
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:09,697
Sit down.

1045
01:16:10,821 --> 01:16:11,959
How is he now?

1046
01:16:12,123 --> 01:16:14,228
The pain has subsided.

1047
01:16:14,292 --> 01:16:16,966
Did he drink the medicine?
- Yes, sir.

1048
01:16:17,728 --> 01:16:19,674
I'll give another
medicine for the pain.

1049
01:16:19,764 --> 01:16:22,711
Sir, Murugeshan came
with you in the morning.

1050
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,713
He came there in the morning;
didn't he come back?

1051
01:16:25,803 --> 01:16:26,941
No. sir.

1052
01:16:27,038 --> 01:16:28,215
He will come.
- Okay sir.

1053
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:30,048
Please bring some
water to drink.

1054
01:16:30,108 --> 01:16:31,644
I'll bring it, sir.

1055
01:16:31,976 --> 01:16:33,978
Oh God!
- Be careful".

1056
01:17:33,204 --> 01:17:38,677
Kelu Nam biar's goons will
attack the Tamil slums tonight.

1057
01:17:38,809 --> 01:17:41,790
Othenan and ILP members
will come there.

1058
01:17:46,984 --> 01:17:48,986
We should finish
everything by tonight.

1059
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:53,898
Traitor!

1060
01:17:57,729 --> 01:17:59,003
Namaste Pattar...

1061
01:17:59,697 --> 01:18:02,109
I came to give a medicine
for MalayilAmma.

1062
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:03,144
Okay.
Go ahead.

1063
01:18:06,304 --> 01:18:07,282
<i>Kammarettan.</i>

1064
01:18:15,379 --> 01:18:16,357
Sir..

1065
01:18:16,714 --> 01:18:17,692
Sir..

1066
01:18:21,686 --> 01:18:22,664
What is it?

1067
01:18:23,087 --> 01:18:24,725
Malayil Amma is really sick.

1068
01:18:24,889 --> 01:18:26,232
She wants to meet you.

1069
01:18:29,193 --> 01:18:30,604
Kammaran is here as well.

1070
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:45,051
Listen carefully to what I'm
going to say now, Bhanu.

1071
01:18:46,277 --> 01:18:47,312
Othenan...

1072
01:18:48,246 --> 01:18:49,850
is going to
kill the Collector.

1073
01:18:50,014 --> 01:18:50,992
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

1074
01:18:52,817 --> 01:18:54,023
We need freedom...

1075
01:18:54,752 --> 01:18:55,730
We need to protest...

1076
01:18:56,087 --> 01:18:57,259
I will be there for all that.

1077
01:18:57,922 --> 01:18:59,162
I can understand all that.

1078
01:18:59,757 --> 01:19:00,735
But..

1079
01:19:01,159 --> 01:19:02,968
This is a dangerous game.

1080
01:19:03,695 --> 01:19:08,166
I'm saying this because I know the might of
the army in Pavanagudi through Coogan Saheb

1081
01:19:09,267 --> 01:19:11,144
They wouldn't win...

1082
01:19:11,969 --> 01:19:14,142
and every single one of
them would fall dead.

1083
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:15,216
Oh no!

1084
01:19:20,778 --> 01:19:21,756
Who is in there?

1085
01:19:22,013 --> 01:19:23,117
It's me, Bhanu.

1086
01:19:28,853 --> 01:19:30,230
When you were about to fall..

1087
01:19:32,189 --> 01:19:33,167
Kammaretta,

1088
01:19:33,758 --> 01:19:35,738
you should save
Othenettan somehow.

1089
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:38,269
I tried my best to convince him.

1090
01:19:38,796 --> 01:19:39,866
He didn't listen.

1091
01:19:40,998 --> 01:19:42,238
Don't worry.

1092
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:45,147
I will be there as a shield to him!

1093
01:19:45,503 --> 01:19:46,709
Always.

1094
01:19:47,071 --> 01:19:48,049
But..

1095
01:19:48,773 --> 01:19:51,219
Can you see to it that
Othenettan doesn't go tomorrow?

1096
01:19:51,809 --> 01:19:52,981
Bhanu!
- Yes.

1097
01:19:57,782 --> 01:19:59,090
Don't be afraid.

1098
01:19:59,951 --> 01:20:01,294
I am with you all.

1099
01:20:03,287 --> 01:20:04,265
With you!

1100
01:20:16,901 --> 01:20:18,107
You should be here.

1101
01:20:19,136 --> 01:20:20,206
With grandmother.

1102
01:20:20,338 --> 01:20:21,316
Okay?
- Yes.

1103
01:20:33,317 --> 01:20:37,265
Othenan will be captured
by the Whites any moment.

1104
01:20:39,924 --> 01:20:42,905
I know where Othenan is.

1105
01:20:44,795 --> 01:20:48,538
I'm not asking for anything
unreasonable, sir.

1106
01:20:49,867 --> 01:20:55,374
You should return our house and land,
that belong to my sister and me.

1107
01:20:58,910 --> 01:20:59,888
Pattar"

1108
01:21:01,579 --> 01:21:03,115
Hey Pattar"
- Yes.

1109
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:07,520
Return his documents.

1110
01:21:07,585 --> 01:21:08,859
The 'Aadhaaram' (Title Deed)

1111
01:21:09,454 --> 01:21:11,434
Sir, that.
- Give it back!

1112
01:21:22,266 --> 01:21:23,244
Tell me.

1113
01:21:23,434 --> 01:21:24,412
Where is he?

1114
01:21:25,937 --> 01:21:27,007
Where is he?

1115
01:21:28,206 --> 01:21:29,184
I'll tell you.

1116
01:21:30,041 --> 01:21:31,019
But..

1117
01:21:31,909 --> 01:21:34,355
Before that, you
should give me a word.

1118
01:21:35,913 --> 01:21:39,326
Nothing should happen to
my house or my sister.

1119
01:21:40,151 --> 01:21:41,562
You have my word.
Tell me.

1120
01:21:44,422 --> 01:21:45,400
Sir...

1121
01:21:46,591 --> 01:21:51,904
Othenan and his gang are
given food and shelter",

1122
01:21:52,263 --> 01:21:54,072
by the wastrels in the slums.

1123
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,843
They have a grudge
against you as well.

1124
01:22:25,363 --> 01:22:28,367
Sir, the Tamilians
are innocent people

1125
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,345
Must be out of helplessness.
- Go!

1126
01:22:31,002 --> 01:22:33,414
Then shall 
..
- Get lost!

1127
01:22:48,219 --> 01:22:49,425
Singh Bhai..

1128
01:22:49,487 --> 01:22:51,125
You bloody traitor!

1129
01:22:52,323 --> 01:22:54,325
Not Traitor!
Aadhaar (Title Deed)

1130
01:23:04,302 --> 01:23:05,280
What is it?

1131
01:23:20,218 --> 01:23:21,196
Singh Bhai!

1132
01:23:26,391 --> 01:23:28,166
No! Please!

1133
01:23:28,659 --> 01:23:31,538
You dog who licks the
Britishers' shoes!

1134
01:23:42,473 --> 01:23:43,451
Singh Bhai..

1135
01:23:45,376 --> 01:23:46,354
Singh!

1136
01:23:46,978 --> 01:23:47,956
Don't kill me!

1137
01:23:48,279 --> 01:23:50,350
I did everything for ILP.

1138
01:23:50,648 --> 01:23:51,625
Forgive me.

1139
01:23:51,649 --> 01:23:52,957
I haven't done anything wrong.

1140
01:23:53,084 --> 01:23:54,620
I'll give you everything I own.

1141
01:23:54,952 --> 01:23:55,930
Don't kill me.

1142
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:57,198
Don't kill me.

1143
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:00,492
You bloody traitor!

1144
01:24:00,725 --> 01:24:01,068
Your game is over!

1145
01:24:01,092 --> 01:24:02,571
Your game is over!

1146
01:24:11,102 --> 01:24:13,241
Kammaran Anna,
nothing happened to you, right?

1147
01:24:13,605 --> 01:24:14,583
Who is he?

1148
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:15,916
What's the problem?

1149
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:16,008
What's the problem?

1150
01:24:17,975 --> 01:24:19,113
He is Ke
u's man.

1151
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:21,190
He came to molest your women.

1152
01:24:21,579 --> 01:24:22,614
I was stopping him.

1153
01:24:22,747 --> 01:24:22,923
You please leave.

1154
01:24:22,947 --> 01:24:23,948
You please leave.

1155
01:24:24,081 --> 01:24:25,185
We will take care of this.

1156
01:24:27,618 --> 01:24:28,688
Hey! Pick him up!

1157
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:30,198
Pick him!

1158
01:24:35,093 --> 01:24:36,071
Grandmother,

1159
01:24:37,095 --> 01:24:38,073
Othenan"

1160
01:24:38,363 --> 01:24:38,939
Othenan will kill Kelu..
- Nothing will happen"

1161
01:24:38,963 --> 01:24:40,374
Othenan will kill Kelu..
- Nothing will happen"

1162
01:25:01,752 --> 01:25:02,730
What happened, brother?

1163
01:25:04,455 --> 01:25:05,627
What's that on your face?

1164
01:25:06,457 --> 01:25:07,435
Come.

1165
01:25:07,592 --> 01:25:08,570
What is it?

1166
01:25:08,793 --> 01:25:10,170
Tell me what happened!

1167
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:30,358
Father"

1168
01:25:36,821 --> 01:25:37,799
Kiddo..

1169
01:25:43,161 --> 01:25:44,137
Here.

1170
01:25:44,161 --> 01:25:45,139
Hold this.

1171
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:47,604
Keep it here.

1172
01:25:51,302 --> 01:25:52,280
Kiddo...

1173
01:25:53,738 --> 01:25:55,046
this key,

1174
01:25:55,506 --> 01:25:56,780
it's yours from now on.

1175
01:25:57,141 --> 01:26:01,487
This house, fields, this title deed;
everything is yours from now on.

1176
01:26:02,847 --> 01:26:04,087
Our poor father"

1177
01:26:11,522 --> 01:26:12,500
Brother"

1178
01:26:13,091 --> 01:26:14,229
Bring the gruel, dear"

1179
01:26:42,387 --> 01:26:43,365
Brother,

1180
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:48,363
Did you see Thilakan Chettan?

1181
01:26:51,829 --> 01:26:53,331
Torch all the huts!

1182
01:27:14,185 --> 01:27:15,528
Sir, bomb!

1183
01:27:15,586 --> 01:27:16,826
Fire!
Fire!

1184
01:27:16,921 --> 01:27:18,923
It's them!

LP..!!

1185
01:27:48,619 --> 01:27:49,597
What's happening there?

1186
01:27:51,322 --> 01:27:52,426
Sit down, kiddo!

1187
01:27:54,826 --> 01:27:55,804
Othenan...

1188
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:59,501
like Kammarettan said, Kelu and his
goons are attacking the Tamil slums.

1189
01:28:00,498 --> 01:28:01,909
Where is Satnam?

1190
01:28:03,234 --> 01:28:04,611
You take care of the goons.

1191
01:28:05,336 --> 01:28:06,647
Merchiston is mine!

1192
01:28:06,671 --> 01:28:07,649
Go! Go!

1193
01:28:07,772 --> 01:28:09,581
Come on,fast!

1194
01:28:30,661 --> 01:28:32,334
Thimmappa!
- Master!

1195
01:28:32,397 --> 01:28:33,740
Beat them all to death!

1196
01:28:46,678 --> 01:28:47,986
Othenan...

1197
01:28:48,346 --> 01:28:50,656
Othenan!
- Grandmother!

1198
01:28:50,948 --> 01:28:52,894
Gomathy"
- Nothing will happen, grandmother.

1199
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:54,258
Othenettan will come.

1200
01:28:54,852 --> 01:28:56,354
Othenan...
- Grandmother"

1201
01:29:23,681 --> 01:29:24,955
Stay here itself.

1202
01:30:16,367 --> 01:30:18,369
Gowda,
burn everything!

1203
01:30:18,669 --> 01:30:20,614
Don't spare anyone!

1204
01:30:20,638 --> 01:30:23,016
Don't spare even a single hut.

1205
01:30:23,074 --> 01:30:26,419
Torch them!
Torch them all!

1206
01:31:08,986 --> 01:31:12,490
Whatever happens, whatever you hear,
don't open the door.

1207
01:31:12,857 --> 01:31:14,427
Don't step outside, at all!

1208
01:32:04,842 --> 01:32:05,820
Grandmother!

1209
01:32:07,011 --> 01:32:08,183
Othenettan will come.

1210
01:32:09,547 --> 01:32:10,753
Go that way!
Fasﬂ

1211
01:32:13,151 --> 01:32:14,687
Torch it!

1212
01:32:14,986 --> 01:32:17,432
Pour it all over.
Torch every single one of them..

1213
01:32:20,224 --> 01:32:24,195
At midnight, if a bunch of green
leaves burn on their own;

1214
01:32:24,495 --> 01:32:26,202
you will get her.

1215
01:32:31,536 --> 01:32:33,516
Sir, save us.
Please!

1216
01:32:33,571 --> 01:32:35,175
They have burned everything, sir.

1217
01:32:35,239 --> 01:32:37,116
Save us, sir..
- I'll save you!

1218
01:32:41,245 --> 01:32:42,553
Come here..

1219
01:32:53,591 --> 01:32:55,571
You and your bloody ILP!

1220
01:32:57,028 --> 01:32:58,006
Sir..

1221
01:32:58,162 --> 01:33:00,541
Sir..
Malayil Am ma".

1222
01:33:00,565 --> 01:33:03,205
Her condition is really bad.
You should go there quickly.

1223
01:33:03,601 --> 01:33:05,103
Burn all these huts
and even the fields!

1224
01:33:05,703 --> 01:33:07,273
We fed milk to snakes!

1225
01:33:09,741 --> 01:33:11,812
Mother!

1226
01:33:15,113 --> 01:33:16,091
Mu rugeshan!

1227
01:33:16,714 --> 01:33:17,692
Get up!

1228
01:33:20,084 --> 01:33:21,062
Come.

1229
01:33:21,652 --> 01:33:22,858
We shouldn't let Kelu get away.

1230
01:33:24,889 --> 01:33:26,061
Come.

1231
01:33:47,645 --> 01:33:48,623
Grandmother!

1232
01:33:48,846 --> 01:33:49,824
Grandmother!

1233
01:33:51,282 --> 01:33:52,260
Grandmother!

1234
01:34:10,001 --> 01:34:10,979
Sir..

1235
01:34:11,169 --> 01:34:12,546
What happened, sir?

1236
01:34:12,670 --> 01:34:13,647
Sir..

1237
01:34:13,671 --> 01:34:15,275
Oh no!
Who did this?

1238
01:34:15,706 --> 01:34:17,014
Was it Murugeshan?
- Yes.

1239
01:34:19,177 --> 01:34:20,554
No!

1240
01:34:21,178 --> 01:34:22,156
It's me!

1241
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,819
Vishwam bharan Nambiar's son.

1242
01:34:24,882 --> 01:34:25,860

I have never heard such

I want to make this
real story into a film.

Achaya, I'll tell you something.

01:44:46,437 --> 01:44:48,983
It will do good for us,
only if we boost ILP.

We should turn this MN

For this we need a

I have 2 conditions.

1380
01:45:38,523 --> 01:45:39,499
What?

1381
01:45:39,523 --> 01:45:40,501
Condition No.1...!

1382
01:45:41,459 --> 01:45:45,271
you need to give me the Tamil-Hindi
rights for Kammaran's story.

1383
01:45:45,363 --> 01:45:46,740
That means?
- No way!

1384
01:45:46,797 --> 01:45:49,810
Only then I can make the
movie in my way, over there.

1385
01:45:49,834 --> 01:45:52,337
Achaya, that's not possible!
- That's okay!

1386
01:45:52,403 --> 01:45:53,541
It's in Tamil <i>&</i> Hindi, right?

1387
01:45:54,706 --> 01:45:55,810
But one thing.

1388
01:45:56,074 --> 01:45:58,247
You can start there only
after it releases here.

1389
01:45:58,676 --> 01:45:59,654
Of course!

1390
01:46:00,678 --> 01:46:01,656

1391
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:05,853
You need to give me artistes who
match these photos exactly.

1392
01:46:05,917 --> 01:46:06,895
Sure!

1393
01:46:07,552 --> 01:46:10,032
And for Othenan's character,
Tamil star Siddharth.

1394
01:46:10,088 --> 01:46:11,590
That's all your choice, sir.

1395
01:46:12,290 --> 01:46:14,031

<i>your Weep sir.</i>

1397
01:46:17,628 --> 01:46:19,039

1400
01:46:21,532 --> 01:46:24,570

The flag is here.
- Do we have a flag?

1402
01:46:26,704 --> 01:46:28,411
The flag is all dusty.

1403
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:31,679
How is it?
- Hold it the other way round!

1404
01:46:33,544 --> 01:46:34,522
How is it?

1405
01:46:34,579 --> 01:46:35,557
What is this?

1406
01:46:35,613 --> 01:46:36,591
We need a new flag.

1407
01:46:38,383 --> 01:46:39,623
Take that black cloth.

1408
01:46:41,452 --> 01:46:42,430
What for?

1409
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:43,498
A black flag?

1410
01:46:48,126 --> 01:46:49,537
Vignesh, give me the marker.

1411
01:46:50,461 --> 01:46:51,439
Here, sir.

1412
01:46:52,596 --> 01:46:53,973
Oh! A new design?

1413
01:46:56,834 --> 01:46:58,711
Sheesh!

01:47:17,455 --> 01:47:18,525
A raining cloud.

A lightning bolt.

1418
01:47:20,592 --> 01:47:22,765
Hereafter, this will be 
LP's flag.

1419
01:47:23,961 --> 01:47:27,431
In the scorching heat of corruption,
with a raining cloud of virtue;

1420
01:47:27,532 --> 01:47:29,808
like a lightning bolt,
ILP!

1421
01:47:30,635 --> 01:47:31,773
How is it?
-Awesome!

1422
01:47:31,836 --> 01:47:32,940
Nice, right?

1423
01:47:33,438 --> 01:47:34,917
And ya, director!

1424
01:47:35,373 --> 01:47:37,478
What's the name of our movie?

1425
01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:40,111
The name of the movie is...

1426
01:47:41,045 --> 01:47:42,388
Sam bhavam
('The Event')

1427
01:47:42,714 --> 01:47:44,358
It's time for an interval now!

1428
01:47:44,382 --> 01:47:46,794
And watch the rest of the
movie in the theatre!

1429
01:47:59,697 --> 01:48:01,404
Hey Bose!

1430
01:48:02,867 --> 01:48:03,845
Bose!

1431
01:48:05,837 --> 01:48:08,681
Why do you keep calling
Bose, Bose all the time?

1432
01:48:08,806 --> 01:48:09,784
I'm here only.

1433
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:11,380
Hey..

1434
01:48:13,544 --> 01:48:14,545
Hey..

1435
01:48:14,645 --> 01:48:20,095
Some truths and facts that I told
the director who came that day,

1436
01:48:21,085 --> 01:48:26,057
I'm anxious to know how the
people would respond to it.

1437
01:48:27,558 --> 01:48:30,804
You said whatever came to your
mind, without any memory or sense.

1438
01:48:30,828 --> 01:48:31,932
And now you're anxious?

1439
01:48:31,996 --> 01:48:35,205
God only knows what all troubles
are going to come ourway.

1440
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:37,135
Hey..

1441
01:48:37,969 --> 01:48:39,846
When is that film releasing?

1442
01:48:39,937 --> 01:48:42,440
They have finished shooting it.
It will release next week.

1443
01:48:44,709 --> 01:48:47,656
I want to see that film.

1444
01:48:47,779 --> 01:48:48,757
Why?

1445
01:48:49,781 --> 01:48:50,919
Isn't it...

1446
01:48:51,015 --> 01:48:53,689
my own story, after all?

1447
01:48:53,785 --> 01:48:57,790
Waiting to see your biography
as a movie like Kanchanamala?

1448
01:48:58,089 --> 01:48:59,830
Shut up and go to
sleep, you old man!

1449
01:49:00,124 --> 01:49:02,434
You're about to die and
you want to watch movies?

1450
01:49:02,493 --> 01:49:03,870
Hey Bo..

1451
01:49:08,466 --> 01:49:10,673
God! I hope there
won't be any trouble.

1452
01:49:51,676 --> 01:49:52,711
Drink it, my darling.

1453
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:03,656
Vishwambharan!

1454
01:50:03,822 --> 01:50:05,927
You son of a b@$%!
Come out!

1455
01:50:08,225 --> 01:50:09,203
Kammaran!

1456
01:50:10,128 --> 01:50:12,768
Beyond this step",
it's our country!

1457
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:14,532
Our free country.

1458
01:50:14,965 --> 01:50:15,943
No White man,

1459
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,674
and no Indian with his
knees bent before him..,

1460
01:50:18,936 --> 01:50:20,540
should cross this step!

1461
01:50:20,905 --> 01:50:22,976
If they do, slice them up, boy!

1462
01:50:25,143 --> 01:50:26,850
I'll take care of mother and sister.

1463
01:50:27,145 --> 01:50:28,123
You go ahead, father.

1464
01:50:33,685 --> 01:50:36,256
Who wants to kill this Vishwambharan?
Come!

1465
01:51:17,729 --> 01:51:18,707
Othenan!

1466
01:51:34,178 --> 01:51:37,648
Is he the Lok Mariya Thilak
of Am ruthasam udram?

1467
01:51:38,249 --> 01:51:39,853
Thimmappa!
- Madam!

1468
01:51:41,219 --> 01:51:43,358
Hail... Motherland...!!

1469
01:51:54,098 --> 01:51:55,236
Father!

1470
01:51:56,434 --> 01:51:58,277
Father!

1471
01:52:05,176 --> 01:52:06,883
'The Event'

1472
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:43,416
But who?
Where?

1473
01:52:45,883 --> 01:52:47,260
You both have only one job.

1474
01:52:47,752 --> 01:52:50,096
You must deliver these
two letters safely.

1475
01:53:17,815 --> 01:53:21,762
Netaji, we've captured two of your
soldiers who were acting as double agents.

1476
01:53:21,786 --> 01:53:23,424
What would you want
us to do with them?

1477
01:53:28,125 --> 01:53:29,103
These two?

1478
01:53:34,799 --> 01:53:36,005
Kneel down!

1479
01:53:36,834 --> 01:53:38,814
Forgive us, Netaji.
- Forgive us, Netaji.

1480
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:40,471
We made a mistake.

1481
01:53:51,115 --> 01:53:52,287
Forgive us, Netaji.

1482
01:53:54,452 --> 01:53:55,829
Forgive us, Netaji.

1483
01:54:32,556 --> 01:54:33,534
Dhi

on..

1484
01:54:33,558 --> 01:54:36,095
Deliver this photo to Himanshu.
- Yes sir.

1485
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:38,367
Command him to show it to the
recipient of the letter,

1486
01:54:38,429 --> 01:54:41,000
so that he understands that
this is my last command.

1487
01:54:43,901 --> 01:54:45,471
Even if Netaji is alive or not...

1488
01:54:46,037 --> 01:54:47,914
Bapuji should definitely stay alive.

1489
01:54:48,906 --> 01:54:50,214
Long Live... India!

1490
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,994
Get the dogs down!

1491
01:55:14,065 --> 01:55:15,066
Move! Move!

1492
01:55:36,488 --> 01:55:38,263
Prepare your guns.

1493
01:55:58,976 --> 01:56:00,421
Fire.

1494
01:56:25,036 --> 01:56:26,344
Brother!

1495
01:56:51,663 --> 01:56:53,142
Himanshu Roy...

1496
01:56:53,298 --> 01:56:55,005
Namaste, my friend.

1497
01:56:57,001 --> 01:56:57,979
Othenan!

1498
01:57:00,338 --> 01:57:01,316
Othenan...

1499
01:57:02,206 --> 01:57:03,480
Nam biar!

1500
01:57:17,622 --> 01:57:19,329
Brother, see this.

1501
01:57:54,759 --> 01:57:55,737
Whom has he sent it for?

1502
01:58:09,106 --> 01:58:10,414
Satnam, quick!

1503
01:58:23,755 --> 01:58:24,733
Maheshwari",

1504
01:58:25,823 --> 01:58:28,497
the farmer's sweat is
like nectar for the land.

1505
01:58:30,161 --> 01:58:31,139
But..

1506
01:58:31,762 --> 01:58:34,572
if his blood falls on the soil,
this land will burn!

1507
01:58:35,633 --> 01:58:36,611
The crops will burn!

1508
01:58:39,203 --> 01:58:42,707
God created landlords, to pluck
unwanted weeds amongst the serfs.

1509
01:58:43,608 --> 01:58:46,748
And not to advocate non-violence
and stay coughing and barking!

1510
01:58:46,811 --> 01:58:48,154
If there's no serf..,

1511
01:58:48,646 --> 01:58:50,455
there won't be a landlord!
Remember that!

1512
01:58:52,584 --> 01:58:53,619
Maheshwari!

1513
01:58:54,819 --> 01:58:56,457
When a person commits a sin..,

1514
01:58:57,388 --> 01:58:59,368
...Time would stand still
and silent like a mute.

1515
01:58:59,490 --> 01:59:00,468
But...

1516
01:59:00,525 --> 01:59:02,562
it will open its mouth
some day in the future;

1517
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:04,467
It will shout out
whatever it has to say...

1518
01:59:06,164 --> 01:59:10,811
A... for Atrocity!

1519
01:59:10,835 --> 01:59:15,284
B... for Bravery!

1520
01:59:15,806 --> 01:59:16,784
That's me!

1521
01:59:17,575 --> 01:59:19,486
A for?
- Atrocity!

1522
01:59:19,510 --> 01:59:22,323
Br....
- Oh no! Teacher!

1523
01:59:22,347 --> 01:59:24,850
Bhanu Chechi, Maheshwari Amma.
- Don't worry.

1524
01:59:30,121 --> 01:59:32,499
Sir, no.
Please!

1525
01:59:32,590 --> 01:59:34,331
Maheshwari Am ma is here!

1526
01:59:36,193 --> 01:59:37,501
Move!
Move away!

1527
01:59:39,831 --> 01:59:41,504
- Move!
- Maheshwari Am ma!

1528
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:43,478
Salutes, Am ma!

1529
01:59:52,710 --> 01:59:54,621
Amma, he wants to say
something to you.

1530
01:59:54,679 --> 01:59:55,657
Am ma,

1531
01:59:55,713 --> 01:59:58,216
please give us some more time.

1532
01:59:59,484 --> 02:00:01,361
Some more time?
Beat him to death!

1533
02:00:07,659 --> 02:00:08,637
Stop it!

1534
02:00:15,266 --> 02:00:16,472
Ammﬂ

1535
02:00:18,536 --> 02:00:20,482
Ammﬂ

1536
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:23,776
Don't hit me, Am ma!

1537
02:00:24,843 --> 02:00:26,322
Don't hit me!

1538
02:00:31,516 --> 02:00:33,587
Don't hit me, please!

1539
02:00:40,691 --> 02:00:42,329
Reveal yourself!

1540
02:01:10,187 --> 02:01:11,165
Bhanu Chechi,

1541
02:01:11,389 --> 02:01:12,390
<i>It's Kammarettan.</i>

1542
02:01:13,291 --> 02:01:16,170
(Cheering)

1543
02:02:00,738 --> 02:02:01,716
<i>Kammaran,</i>

1544
02:02:01,773 --> 02:02:03,775
I finished paying the full
amount with interest.

1545
02:02:04,041 --> 02:02:05,019
But still".

1546
02:02:07,345 --> 02:02:08,483
Hey Kammaran...

1547
02:02:08,679 --> 02:02:13,389
When he pulled your father
Vishwambharan Nam biar to the pole..,

1548
02:02:13,451 --> 02:02:16,330
with his neck tied
to a sugar cane shoot",

1549
02:02:16,354 --> 02:02:18,425
he spat out phlegm,
and shat his pants",

1550
02:02:19,290 --> 02:02:21,668
and palpitated
like a dying dog!

1551
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:24,337
And screamed like a little girl!

1552
02:02:24,862 --> 02:02:28,241
You weren't lucky enough
to see or hear that.

1553
02:02:28,533 --> 02:02:30,535
You were too late...!!

1554
02:02:30,835 --> 02:02:34,348
You could only see the Vishwambharan
swinging dead on the pole",

1555
02:02:34,372 --> 02:02:36,045
with mucous and
eyes popping out.

1556
02:02:36,841 --> 02:02:40,345
You didn't hear anything!
You didn't see anything!

1557
02:02:40,445 --> 02:02:44,393
That's why you are here, standing
like a pole in front of me!

1558
02:02:59,063 --> 02:03:00,406
Maheshwari Am ma...

1559
02:03:01,365 --> 02:03:02,676
By seeing what never happened",

1560
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:04,344
By hearing what was never told",

1561
02:03:04,368 --> 02:03:07,406
By reporting what was never true..,

1562
02:03:07,939 --> 02:03:10,510
You people have destroyed the
lives of many innocent people...

1563
02:03:10,574 --> 02:03:11,951
for crimes they
never committed.

1564
02:03:12,043 --> 02:03:16,617
This has become the land
of fake Messiahs like you!

1565
02:03:17,649 --> 02:03:20,391
To save this land
from demons like you...

1566
02:03:20,685 --> 02:03:23,063
I have taken a re-birth.
And my name is Kammaran!

1567
02:03:24,789 --> 02:03:26,427
Re-birth, my foot!

1568
02:03:26,624 --> 02:03:30,071
Are you trying to scare
Maheshwari with these wastrels?

1569
02:03:31,729 --> 02:03:33,572
The people who are with
me..are not wastrels!

1570
02:03:33,631 --> 02:03:38,080
They are not like your men, who lick boots
at the very mention of the word "Money"!

1571
02:03:38,569 --> 02:03:41,482
They desire nothing.
They believe in truth alone.

1572
02:03:41,606 --> 02:03:43,677
They have pledged their lives
and souls to destiny.

1573
02:03:43,775 --> 02:03:46,517
They are my fellow warriors, who have
come prepared for the final battle!

1574
02:03:46,577 --> 02:03:47,920
This was their land.

1575
02:03:47,979 --> 02:03:49,515
Their own land, that was
snatched away from them.

1576
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:50,558
BY you!

1577
02:03:50,982 --> 02:03:52,086
If you dare...,

1578
02:03:52,550 --> 02:03:54,052
try touching these
poor people again!

02:03:54,119 --> 02:03:55,757

inform everyone near
and dear to you...

1585
02:04:08,967 --> 02:04:10,810
Your fall has begun!

1586
02:04:12,536 --> 02:04:13,914

1587
02:04:13,938 --> 02:04:15,781

02:04:33,391 --> 02:04:41,391
‘Kammaran, The Event..!!'

1592

' You drown in the sea,
Only to rise, O! Mighty sun! '

1593
02:04:54,212 --> 02:04:57,658
' The star of absolute truth...!'

1594
02:04:57,682 --> 02:05:04,532
' Friend to the poor...

' Alone, you bring Great
Britain to her knees... '

1597
02:05:11,896 --> 02:05:19,896
' Handcuffs, you make flowers of...
Kammaran, you are an event! '

1598
02:05:22,973 --> 02:05:30,221
' Kammaran, you are an event! '

1599
02:05:58,643 --> 02:06:05,253
‘Kammaran, The Event..!!'

1600
02:06:05,750 --> 02:06:09,721
' Elements, five, tremble at yourtale‘

1601
02:06:09,954 --> 02:06:12,466
‘Kammaran, The Event..!!'

1602
02:06:12,490 --> 02:06:19,240
"Oh men, who give me your love,
You are my only power! "

1603
02:06:19,264 --> 02:06:26,614
" Here, for you, is my battle! "

1604
02:06:37,281 --> 02:06:40,854
‘Kammaran, The Event..!!'

1605
02:06:44,588 --> 02:06:47,535
‘Kammaran, The Event..!!'

1606
02:06:48,293 --> 02:06:56,293
‘Kammaran, The Event..!!'

1607
02:07:09,814 --> 02:07:16,129
' This tale of Kammaran...
ls written by the brave...!! '

1608
02:07:16,287 --> 02:07:22,863
"No need to play slaves...
To the English blokes. "

1609
02:07:23,094 --> 02:07:30,637
" Together we will...
Bring down this demonic rule...!! "

1610
02:07:30,835 --> 02:07:34,180
' He is the highest cloud..,
when at war...!! '

1611
02:07:34,238 --> 02:07:38,050
' He is limitless..,
when with friends...!! '

1612
02:07:38,142 --> 02:07:41,555
' You drown in the sea,
Only to rise, O! Mighty sun! '

1613
02:07:41,579 --> 02:07:44,788
' The star of absolute truth...! '

1614
02:07:45,016 --> 02:07:51,865
' Friend to the poor...
Messiah to the downtrodden...‘

1615
02:07:51,889 --> 02:07:55,602
' You break all webs of deceit... '

1616
02:07:55,626 --> 02:07:59,005
' Alone, you bring Great
Britain to her knees... '

1617
02:07:59,163 --> 02:08:02,372
' Handcuffs, you make flowers of...‘

1618
02:08:05,903 --> 02:08:07,143
Hey Pattar"

1619
02:08:07,405 --> 02:08:10,284
This freedom struggle <i>&</i>
revolution are like cancer.

1620
02:08:11,176 --> 02:08:13,679
They should be burnt down as
soon as they raise their heads.

1621
02:08:15,112 --> 02:08:17,718
Saying 'don't do anything now'..,

1622
02:08:18,115 --> 02:08:20,186
if we don't do anything
at the right time..,

1623
02:08:20,685 --> 02:08:22,096
it will be really
difficult, later.

1624
02:08:22,620 --> 02:08:24,064
It's because we
didn't do anything",

1625
02:08:24,088 --> 02:08:27,092
that these scoundrels have
grown taller than our roofs!

1626
02:08:27,725 --> 02:08:29,136
What you said is true", mother!

1627
02:08:34,866 --> 02:08:36,675
God! Master Othenan!

1628
02:08:40,972 --> 02:08:44,784
Even after so many years,
you are still beautiful, mother.

1629
02:08:45,076 --> 02:08:46,054
Son..

1630
02:08:49,814 --> 02:08:50,792
Namaste"

1631
02:08:54,752 --> 02:08:55,730
Your father.

1632
02:08:56,120 --> 02:08:57,224
Kelu Nam biar!

1633
02:08:58,255 --> 02:08:59,233
I don't want to see...

1634
02:09:00,024 --> 02:09:01,332
...that "patriot"!

1635
02:09:04,195 --> 02:09:05,674
India shouldn't win freedom.

1636
02:09:06,164 --> 02:09:08,906
This country should be ruled
by the Whites and us.

1637
02:09:09,767 --> 02:09:12,246
Imagine how it would have been
if the British hadn't come here.

1638
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:14,750
Everything that we see here,
was made by them.

1639
02:09:14,905 --> 02:09:18,751
Roads, bridges, electricity,
trains, everything!

1640
02:09:20,044 --> 02:09:23,218
If they are given freedom, the people here
would fight each other in the name of..

1641
02:09:23,281 --> 02:09:26,387
Pork and beef, and pounce at
each others' throats!

1642
02:09:28,286 --> 02:09:31,790
No Kammaran shall rise
from this Amruthasam udram.

1643
02:09:32,924 --> 02:09:34,232
All this will be over.

1644
02:09:36,828 --> 02:09:39,172
All the powers against
us, would be destroyed.

1645
02:09:40,164 --> 02:09:43,475
But there's no point in chopping and
severing their horns and limbs.

1646
02:09:44,769 --> 02:09:46,112
They should be uprooted.

1647
02:09:47,338 --> 02:09:49,249
Their very foundation
should be uprooted.

1648
02:09:49,974 --> 02:09:50,952
They should be killed.

1649
02:09:51,042 --> 02:09:52,020
Yes.

1650
02:09:52,410 --> 02:09:53,480
Kammaran should be killed!

1651
02:09:53,711 --> 02:09:54,781
No, mother.

1652
02:09:54,846 --> 02:09:55,824
Then?

1653
02:09:56,514 --> 02:09:58,221
Wait.
I'll tell you.

1654
02:09:59,250 --> 02:10:02,288
For the time being, no one should
know that I have come here.

1655
02:10:03,021 --> 02:10:03,999
Including my father.

1656
02:10:05,156 --> 02:10:06,897
I need to meet Kammaran.

1657
02:10:07,458 --> 02:10:10,337
First I have to join
him as his close aide.

1658
02:10:37,555 --> 02:10:38,533
Kammaran!

1659
02:10:41,359 --> 02:10:42,337
<i>Kammaran,</i>

1660
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:44,267
I came here to meet you.

1661
02:10:44,762 --> 02:10:46,173
To hand over a letter to you.

1662
02:10:47,198 --> 02:10:49,041
Himanshu was killed
in British bombing.

1663
02:10:50,935 --> 02:10:52,812
Netaji gave this letter to me...

1664
02:10:53,204 --> 02:10:54,877
...at Formosa.

1665
02:10:55,573 --> 02:11:00,249
I had to break three security walls
of British agencies to reach here.

1666
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:04,118
This is a command for you.

1667
02:11:05,884 --> 02:11:07,522
Netaji's last command!

1668
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:19,530
Netaji got this photo
clicked for you, Kammaran.

1669
02:11:33,344 --> 02:11:34,448
Gandhiji...

1670
02:11:35,179 --> 02:11:36,283
Gandhiji...

1671
02:11:36,881 --> 02:11:38,053
in Madurai..!!?

1672
02:11:53,898 --> 02:11:55,900
They have planned
to kill Gandhiji.

1673
02:11:56,434 --> 02:11:57,412
At Madurai.

1674
02:11:57,502 --> 02:11:58,913
We should stop them.

1675
02:11:59,604 --> 02:12:01,242
Even if we have to
sacrifice our lives.

1676
02:12:01,472 --> 02:12:04,112
This is Netaji's last command.

1677
02:12:04,475 --> 02:12:05,453
We will stop them.

1678
02:12:05,610 --> 02:12:06,588
Definitely!

1679
02:12:19,056 --> 02:12:22,265
How do you know Netaji
so well, Kammaran?

1680
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:23,937
After my father's death",

1681
02:12:24,362 --> 02:12:25,466
I left this village.

1682
02:12:26,330 --> 02:12:30,472
I decided that I'd need the help of great
powers, to wage a war against injustice",

1683
02:12:30,668 --> 02:12:31,976
and wandered a lot.

1684
02:12:33,204 --> 02:12:36,344
The place I walked in, first,
was Gandhiji's abode.

1685
02:12:37,008 --> 02:12:37,986
<i>Kammaran,</i>

1686
02:12:38,042 --> 02:12:39,453
please be calm for
some time, son.

1687
02:12:39,543 --> 02:12:43,855
Congress badly needs
patriots like you.

1688
02:12:44,048 --> 02:12:45,026
Bapu,

1689
02:12:45,483 --> 02:12:47,895
My only leader... is you, Bapu!

1690
02:12:48,586 --> 02:12:50,930
Whoever is with you in the Congress party,

1691
02:12:51,889 --> 02:12:55,166
all of them are completely
dishonest, Bapu.

1692
02:12:55,493 --> 02:12:59,669
I cannot fight this war for
freedom, along with them.

1693
02:13:01,299 --> 02:13:02,277
Son,

1694
02:13:02,467 --> 02:13:05,448
I have summoned
someone to meet you.

1695
02:13:05,636 --> 02:13:07,172
I strongly believe",

1696
02:13:07,939 --> 02:13:09,577
that if you talk to him,

1697
02:13:10,207 --> 02:13:12,346
you will definitely
have a change of heart.

1698
02:13:14,979 --> 02:13:16,151
I be
ieve..,

1699
02:13:18,349 --> 02:13:19,919
that you would forgive me.

1700
02:13:22,353 --> 02:13:24,355
Hail Motherland!
- Hail Motherland.

1701
02:13:28,093 --> 02:13:32,542
I decided that I can't save
this country by staying there.

1702
02:13:33,164 --> 02:13:34,142
Finally,

1703
02:13:34,198 --> 02:13:35,677
at Imphal,

1704
02:13:35,933 --> 02:13:37,674
I found my hero.

1705
02:14:15,740 --> 02:14:16,718
Netaji!

1706
02:14:18,609 --> 02:14:19,587
Come on!

1707
02:14:20,478 --> 02:14:21,456
Careful.

1708
02:14:37,061 --> 02:14:38,199
Lie down, sir.

1709
02:15:14,198 --> 02:15:15,506
A raining cloud,

1710
02:15:16,100 --> 02:15:17,374
and a lightning bolt.

1711
02:15:17,635 --> 02:15:20,115
This will be the
symbol of our party.

1712
02:15:44,262 --> 02:15:45,502

LP..!!

1713
02:15:53,471 --> 02:15:55,610
Gandhiji will be killed.

1714
02:15:56,174 --> 02:15:57,619
But the one who's
going to be caught",

1715
02:15:58,176 --> 02:15:59,655
will be your nemesis, mother.

1716
02:15:59,711 --> 02:16:00,689
Who?

1717
02:16:03,515 --> 02:16:04,823
Kammaran Nam biar.

1718
02:16:10,655 --> 02:16:11,793
How's it going to happen?

1719
02:16:17,361 --> 02:16:18,635
Gandhiji is coming.

1720
02:16:18,696 --> 02:16:20,505
On the coming February 2nd..,

1721
02:16:20,665 --> 02:16:21,643
to Madurai,

1722
02:16:22,233 --> 02:16:23,712
and the Meenakshi temple there.

1723
02:16:23,801 --> 02:16:26,372
The lower castes should be
allowed to enter the temple..,

1724
02:16:26,537 --> 02:16:29,649
and unless they are allowed there,
he said he won't set foot there!

1725
02:16:29,673 --> 02:16:30,617
Yes.

1726
02:16:31,209 --> 02:16:35,089
But now, he is coming to visit the temple,
knowing that it has been permitted.

1727
02:16:38,483 --> 02:16:39,621
Beautiful whiskey.

1728
02:16:41,218 --> 02:16:42,561
I got it imported from abroad.

1729
02:16:46,124 --> 02:16:47,102
Don't worry, mother.

1730
02:16:48,626 --> 02:16:49,866
First Gandhiji,

1731
02:16:50,695 --> 02:16:51,765
Then Kammaran.

1732
02:16:54,232 --> 02:16:57,372
Using the rat snake Kammaran",

1733
02:16:57,769 --> 02:17:03,151
we should execute the "Mahatma"
we all fear, Gandhiji..!

1734
02:17:07,178 --> 02:17:08,350
Gandhiji's death...

1735
02:17:09,247 --> 02:17:13,218
More than the Whites, it's the
landlords here who want it to happen.

1736
02:17:13,317 --> 02:17:14,887
If my calculations are right",

1737
02:17:15,820 --> 02:17:19,632
the attack will happen at one among the
three places I'm going to mention now.

1738
02:17:21,192 --> 02:17:22,170
Madurai

1739
02:17:22,693 --> 02:17:23,671
One.

1740
02:17:23,928 --> 02:17:25,908
The entrance of Madurai
Meenakshi temple.

1741
02:17:26,931 --> 02:17:28,171
Two.

1742
02:17:28,266 --> 02:17:31,247
The royal path through which the
procession that brings Gandhiji will pass.

1743
02:17:31,836 --> 02:17:33,907
Three.
Madurai railway station.

1744
02:17:45,250 --> 02:17:49,221
Thilakan will be commanding the
ILP cadre around the temple.

1745
02:17:50,621 --> 02:17:53,329
The responsibility of the royal
path will be for Murugeshan.

1746
02:17:54,292 --> 02:17:55,771
Then, Madurai railway station",

1747
02:17:55,960 --> 02:17:57,938
...the most dangerous landing point.

1748
02:17:57,962 --> 02:18:00,602
There..
- Me and Satnam will be there.

1749
02:18:02,433 --> 02:18:05,380
From the moment Gandhiji's
feet touch this Tamil land",

1750
02:18:05,503 --> 02:18:07,779
...till he leaves from this land,

1751
02:18:08,439 --> 02:18:09,975
I will be there, as his shadow!

1752
02:18:10,942 --> 02:18:12,751
Hail... 
LP..!!

1753
02:18:12,810 --> 02:18:14,721
Hail... "Mission Daddy"!

1754
02:18:15,413 --> 02:18:16,414
Bhanu...

1755
02:18:16,848 --> 02:18:19,226
loving one's woman",

1756
02:18:19,317 --> 02:18:21,797
does not mean forgetting the
love towards one's own mother.

1757
02:18:23,354 --> 02:18:25,334
This country is my mother now.

1758
02:18:27,558 --> 02:18:29,629
I will come, to take
you along with me.

1759
02:18:30,328 --> 02:18:32,308
But tonight is not that night.

1760
02:18:33,998 --> 02:18:35,671
Today, there's only
one thing on my mind.

1761
02:18:36,567 --> 02:18:37,545
My mother!

1762
02:18:38,336 --> 02:18:39,314
You should come.

1763
02:18:45,509 --> 02:18:46,510
<i>Kammarettaa"</i>

1764
02:18:47,611 --> 02:18:49,623
Shall I also come to save Gandhiji?

1765
02:18:49,647 --> 02:18:50,625
No Surendran.

1766
02:18:50,681 --> 02:18:51,659
You should be here.

1767
02:18:51,783 --> 02:18:53,785
To protect Bhanumathi.
- When did this happen?

1768
02:18:53,851 --> 02:18:55,829
Keep quiet.
It's nothing... but truth!

1769
02:18:55,853 --> 02:18:56,831
Ya rig ht!

1770
02:19:01,459 --> 02:19:04,438
There will be tight security
arrangements by the police and ILP,

1771
02:19:04,462 --> 02:19:05,964
at Madurai railway station.

1772
02:19:06,798 --> 02:19:08,334
It's impossible for us to go there.

1773
02:19:08,766 --> 02:19:10,575
We're not going to
Madurai, Satnam.

1774
02:19:11,769 --> 02:19:12,747
Then?

1775
02:19:13,337 --> 02:19:14,816
We will go to Thiruchirappally.

1776
02:19:15,606 --> 02:19:17,685
Before reaching Madurai
railway station...

1777
02:19:17,709 --> 02:19:19,386
Gandhiji will have his last meeting",

1778
02:19:19,410 --> 02:19:20,388
...with us!

1779
02:19:21,779 --> 02:19:23,383
Kammaran shall find GandhijL.

1780
02:19:25,083 --> 02:19:26,357
...but a dead Gandhiji"!

1781
02:19:30,088 --> 02:19:31,066
<i>Kammaretta‘.!</i>

1782
02:19:33,725 --> 02:19:34,965
Kammaretta...
BETRAYAL!

1783
02:19:35,059 --> 02:19:36,538
Othenan is a traitor"!

1784
02:19:36,694 --> 02:19:38,731
He came here to kill Gandhiji"!

1785
02:19:38,830 --> 02:19:41,504
And he's planning to
frame you for that"!

1786
02:19:42,533 --> 02:19:43,744
Lord Kelu told this to me..!

1787
02:19:43,768 --> 02:19:44,912
Saw the twist?

1788
02:19:44,936 --> 02:19:46,813
What if I wasn't there?

1789
02:19:46,871 --> 02:19:50,617
Anyway, Othenan is not a fool to
attempt it at the railway station.

1790
02:19:50,641 --> 02:19:51,619
Then?

1791
02:19:51,809 --> 02:19:52,786
Thilakan,

1792
02:19:52,810 --> 02:19:54,619
let all of them go
inside the station.

1793
02:19:55,112 --> 02:19:56,682
Move to positions..!!

1794
02:19:57,715 --> 02:19:58,693
What about us?

1795
02:20:10,127 --> 02:20:13,870
'Oh my departing beloved'

1796
02:20:14,098 --> 02:20:17,079
'Co m e back'

1797
02:20:17,134 --> 02:20:18,841
You seem to be in a
good mood, brother.

1798
02:20:19,804 --> 02:20:21,613
If this mission turns
out to be successful,

1799
02:20:21,873 --> 02:20:24,581
you must get married next year.

1800
02:20:24,942 --> 02:20:25,920
Satnam",

1801
02:20:27,078 --> 02:20:29,615
my bride is this
country's destruction!

1802
02:21:30,808 --> 02:21:31,786
Attention!

1803
02:21:33,678 --> 02:21:35,089
He is in the next compartment.

1804
02:21:41,218 --> 02:21:42,196
Take cover.

1805
02:22:52,690 --> 02:22:54,567
How did Kammaran
know about our plan?

1806
02:22:54,659 --> 02:22:55,797
This mission can't fail!

1807
02:23:19,316 --> 02:23:20,727
He's coming after me.
Finish him!

1808
02:24:40,998 --> 02:24:41,976
Thilakan...

1809
02:24:45,336 --> 02:24:46,815
Othenan..!!
Don't spare him!

1810
02:25:27,712 --> 02:25:28,986
Kammaran!

1811
02:25:30,315 --> 02:25:32,955
You cannot stop me!

1812
02:25:33,451 --> 02:25:38,231
To defeat me, or our British Empire,
on which the sun never sets",

1813
02:25:38,255 --> 02:25:42,897
...you or your ILP haven't grown
as yet, you son of a B!##h!!

1814
02:25:43,127 --> 02:25:45,437
The British and us,
will RULE India!

1815
02:25:46,731 --> 02:25:47,835
First you!

1816
02:25:48,833 --> 02:25:50,278
Then your Gandhiji"!

1817
02:26:39,517 --> 02:26:41,326
I am IMMORTAL"!

1818
02:26:58,435 --> 02:26:59,778
You traitor!

1819
02:27:00,904 --> 02:27:06,081
To defeat your British empire, on
which the sun never sets, and you..,

1820
02:27:06,177 --> 02:27:08,214
...this Kammaran alone is enough!

1821
02:27:08,346 --> 02:27:10,849
If there's a Maheshwari
Amma behind you..,

1822
02:27:11,315 --> 02:27:14,524
....behind me, there are millions
of people betrayed by you!

1823
02:27:14,752 --> 02:27:16,732
There are the prayers
of so many mothers!

1824
02:27:22,059 --> 02:27:23,170
Kammaran...

1825
02:27:23,194 --> 02:27:27,336
You mustn't stay alive to attack
Gandhiji again, you deceiver!

1826
02:28:07,071 --> 02:28:08,880
If I say that I boarded that train,

1827
02:28:10,041 --> 02:28:12,885
to save Gandhiji, from
Indians who are my brothers",

1828
02:28:13,377 --> 02:28:19,555
and the British, who were
hand-in-hand with them..,

1829
02:28:20,117 --> 02:28:21,391
...would you believe that?

1830
02:28:21,852 --> 02:28:22,830
No..!

1831
02:28:22,920 --> 02:28:26,399
If I say that it was Netaji Subhash
Chandra Bose who commanded me,

1832
02:28:26,423 --> 02:28:29,927
to board the train and protect
Gandhiji's life...

1833
02:28:30,594 --> 02:28:33,165
Leave alone today",

1834
02:28:33,965 --> 02:28:36,036
would you ever be
able to believe it?

1835
02:28:36,100 --> 02:28:37,077
No.,!!

1836
02:28:37,101 --> 02:28:38,944
I have nothing more to say, "Saheb"!

1837
02:28:39,203 --> 02:28:40,147
Go!

1838
02:28:40,571 --> 02:28:42,573
Go and test if the hangman's
rope is strong enough!

1839
02:28:43,274 --> 02:28:45,845
It's a rope that has to take
the life of a truthful man!

1840
02:28:45,910 --> 02:28:47,116
It needs to be strong.

1841
02:28:47,211 --> 02:28:48,189
Go!

1842
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:04,038
<i>Jawahar,</i>

1843
02:29:04,095 --> 02:29:06,905
he is the person I was
talking to you about.

1844
02:29:07,098 --> 02:29:10,636
There are very few
patriots like him.

1845
02:29:11,869 --> 02:29:13,906
He is Kammaran Nambiar...

1846
02:29:14,472 --> 02:29:15,951
from Amruthasamduram.

1847
02:29:57,615 --> 02:30:00,323
If it is a boy that you give birth to",

1848
02:30:01,185 --> 02:30:02,163
name him,

1849
02:30:04,188 --> 02:30:05,326
Bose..!

1850
02:30:06,157 --> 02:30:08,159
Name him Subhash Chandra Bose..!

1851
02:30:10,094 --> 02:30:11,072
Dad!

1852
02:30:20,605 --> 02:30:22,016
Hail... 
LP..!

1853
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:24,110
Hail...

Long Live... Kammaran Ayya..!!

1855
02:30:57,775 --> 02:30:58,753
Officer",

1856
02:30:59,577 --> 02:31:01,955
didn't you ask me what
my last wish was?

1857
02:31:03,581 --> 02:31:07,051
I want to watch my death
with my own eyes.

1858
02:31:07,418 --> 02:31:09,329
Don't cover my head.
- That's not possible.

1859
02:31:09,454 --> 02:31:10,432
It's a rule.

1860
02:31:11,188 --> 02:31:12,166
"Saheb"!!

1861
02:32:10,614 --> 02:32:13,686
Kammaran... has been acquitted..!!

1862
02:32:16,821 --> 02:32:20,792
Long Live... Kammaran..!!

02:32:29,767 --> 02:32:32,213

Long Live... Kammaran..!!
Hail... 
LP..!

1868
02:32:52,089 --> 02:32:53,727
You should lead us, Kammaran.

1869
02:32:54,492 --> 02:32:55,470
No.,!!

1870
02:32:56,360 --> 02:32:59,170
This is a land that gave birth to so
many people much greater than me.

1871
02:32:59,631 --> 02:33:01,702
To rule you,
there's the Congress.

1872
02:33:01,832 --> 02:33:04,779
There are many Sanghs,
parties and accomplices.

1873
02:33:04,835 --> 02:33:07,543
If ever a day comes, when this land
slumps into corruption and violence",

1874
02:33:07,638 --> 02:33:08,616
on that day",

1875
02:33:09,540 --> 02:33:11,611
if this country feels
that it needs me..,

1876
02:33:11,709 --> 02:33:13,188
and if I am alive
on that day",

1877
02:33:13,644 --> 02:33:14,850
I will definitely come...!!

1878
02:33:18,416 --> 02:33:20,623
Long Live... Kammaran..!!

1879
02:33:21,319 --> 02:33:23,856
Long Live... Kammaran..!!

1880
02:33:24,322 --> 02:33:27,098
Long Live... Kammaran..!!

1881
02:33:31,495 --> 02:33:32,473
Awesome, dad.

1882
02:33:34,765 --> 02:33:36,369
- Dileepetta, awesome.
- Thanks.

1883
02:33:41,405 --> 02:33:49,405
Long Live... KammarettanJ!
Hail.. lLF-‘...!!

1884
02:33:53,918 --> 02:33:56,398
(cheering continues)

1885
02:33:57,321 --> 02:33:59,323
Lalu, just a minute.
- It was superb.

1886
02:33:59,424 --> 02:34:01,233
Thanks.
- Dileepetta, awesome!

1887
02:34:01,359 --> 02:34:02,667
Dad, should I hold you?

1888
02:34:02,827 --> 02:34:03,805
Excuse me.

1889
02:34:04,829 --> 02:34:05,807
Just a minute.

1890
02:34:05,863 --> 02:34:06,841
Kammaran sir..

1891
02:34:09,433 --> 02:34:11,208
Oh! It's actor Dileep.

1892
02:34:12,236 --> 02:34:13,214
Namaste.

1893
02:34:13,404 --> 02:34:14,381
lam Dileep.

1894
02:34:14,405 --> 02:34:16,214
What do you do?
- Huh?

1895
02:34:16,474 --> 02:34:20,217
He is the actor, who played your
character in this movie - Dileep.

1896
02:34:20,311 --> 02:34:22,587
Uh..Oh!
Make way!

1897
02:34:23,281 --> 02:34:24,351
He's an old man, right?

1898
02:34:24,448 --> 02:34:27,827
The crowd has gathered to catch
a glimpse of Kammarettan.

1899
02:34:33,191 --> 02:34:36,365
As Kammaran sir's son,
what is your opinion?

1900
02:34:36,627 --> 02:34:39,606
It's a great blessing that I
was born as this father's son.

1901
02:34:39,630 --> 02:34:42,907
I grew up listening to these stories
of my father from my mother.

1902
02:34:44,435 --> 02:34:45,937
Okay Dileepetta!
- Bye.

1903
02:34:46,671 --> 02:34:47,649
See!

1904
02:34:47,771 --> 02:34:48,943
Look at their excitement!

1905
02:34:49,640 --> 02:34:50,618
Lalu,

1906
02:34:51,308 --> 02:34:53,345
I'm the one who suffered
and took all the troubles.

1907
02:34:53,477 --> 02:34:55,479
Look!
- That's how it should be, right?

1908
02:34:55,613 --> 02:34:57,752
The audience should always
be with the character",

1909
02:34:57,815 --> 02:34:59,419
and not with the actor!

1910
02:34:59,483 --> 02:35:00,791
What?
- Well".

1911
02:35:01,418 --> 02:35:03,796
the credit for that goes to the actor.
To you!

1912
02:35:03,988 --> 02:35:05,934
Congratulations!
- Ya right.

1913
02:35:06,390 --> 02:35:07,835
All the best, Kammaran sir.

1914
02:35:20,338 --> 02:35:25,619
‘To rule for five years...,
The tender has been called for! '

1915
02:35:25,643 --> 02:35:27,987
' The run has begun!'

1916
02:35:28,246 --> 02:35:30,726
' The land is all quaking! '

1917
02:35:30,981 --> 02:35:36,496
' The biggies are shaken...
The foxes are bewildered! '

1918
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:41,833
' The biggies are shaken...
The foxes are bewildered! '

1919
02:35:41,926 --> 02:35:44,406
' What will we get?
What will we get? '

1920
02:35:44,462 --> 02:35:46,806
' For standing with you,
what will we get?‘

1921
02:35:46,864 --> 02:35:49,538
"Notes and tickets,
you will get!"

1922
02:35:49,634 --> 02:35:52,376
"And seats for the lucky ones!"

1923
02:35:52,436 --> 02:35:57,715
"We'll sing all the way...
And win the race!"

1924
02:35:57,775 --> 02:36:03,020
"We'll sing all the way...
And win the race!"

1925
02:36:13,724 --> 02:36:16,671
"Brew it!
Mix it..!!"

1926
02:36:16,727 --> 02:36:18,798
"Add some soda to it..!!"

1927
02:36:18,863 --> 02:36:24,040
"Then, think and think,
on how to win back the defector"

1928
02:36:24,435 --> 02:36:27,081
"We'll throw notes, and win seats!"

1929
02:36:27,105 --> 02:36:29,676
"We'll throw notes, and buy votes!"

1930
02:36:29,774 --> 02:36:32,084
"We'll hoodwink the people..,

1931
02:36:32,343 --> 02:36:35,347
and win, win and WIN...!!"

1932
02:36:37,348 --> 02:36:41,922
The agonies that both Kammarettan &

went through, to save Gandhiji"!

1933
02:36:41,986 --> 02:36:44,557
Have you not seen it?
Don't you know it?

1934
02:36:45,389 --> 02:36:47,391
I have fought",

1935
02:36:47,692 --> 02:36:50,070
against the British!

1936
02:36:50,428 --> 02:36:52,032
I have waged wars!

1937
02:37:01,672 --> 02:37:04,346
"Milk will flow! Honey will flow!"

1938
02:37:04,408 --> 02:37:06,921
"Let's bluff, bluff and bluff...!!"

1939
02:37:06,945 --> 02:37:11,655
"We'll seduce them all",
and make them fools...!!"

1940
02:37:12,583 --> 02:37:15,095
"We'll sweep the elections...!!"

1941
02:37:15,119 --> 02:37:17,764
"We'll overthrow them..,
and rule the land...!!"

1942
02:37:17,788 --> 02:37:23,101
"We'll 'sack' the voters, and...
win, win and WIN...!!"

1943
02:37:23,361 --> 02:37:25,864
You should nominate me for
the Chief Minister's post.

1944
02:37:27,799 --> 02:37:30,405
Bose Kammaran, Kerala Chief Minister.

1945
02:37:33,671 --> 02:37:40,782
"We'll sing all the way...
And win the race!"

1946
02:37:40,945 --> 02:37:42,623
ILP wave all over Kerala.

1947
02:37:42,647 --> 02:37:44,524
For the first time in
the history of Kerala,

1948
02:37:44,548 --> 02:37:46,687
without a Left front
or Right front,

1949
02:37:46,784 --> 02:37:49,822
the third front led by
the ILP rises to power.

1950
02:37:55,426 --> 02:37:56,437
Kammaretta...

1951
02:37:56,461 --> 02:37:57,872
The media is waiting for you.

1952
02:37:58,062 --> 02:37:59,940
After the election in '57,

1953
02:37:59,964 --> 02:38:03,502
this is the first time that journalists
from America are waiting here, apparently.

1954
02:38:04,702 --> 02:38:05,680
Please come.

1955
02:38:05,837 --> 02:38:08,443
And announce who's going
to be the Chief Minister.

1956
02:38:12,176 --> 02:38:14,122
Namaste, everyone.

1957
02:38:18,683 --> 02:38:24,565
I had never desired to be
in positions of power.

1958
02:38:24,855 --> 02:38:32,831
I've always handed over positions
and fame to others, and stayed away.

1959
02:38:33,030 --> 02:38:35,442
There's no change in that, even today.

1960
02:38:35,967 --> 02:38:39,176
I have only a few days left to die.
- Father!

1961
02:38:40,104 --> 02:38:41,811
So,

1962
02:38:41,973 --> 02:38:48,618
it's wise to give the power
to people younger than me.

1963
02:38:52,049 --> 02:38:59,695
But what is the greatest threat
that our land is facing today?

1964
02:39:00,257 --> 02:39:03,101
An irresponsible line of leaders.

1965
02:39:03,227 --> 02:39:10,236
In such a situation, no politician
whom you are familiar with,

1966
02:39:10,468 --> 02:39:13,244
should be given the
Chief Ministefs chair.

1967
02:39:13,537 --> 02:39:17,883
Time and History...
are saying that to me.

1968
02:39:18,108 --> 02:39:20,213
Move.
Move to the backside.

1969
02:39:21,012 --> 02:39:24,186
Another habit of this country is..,

1970
02:39:24,248 --> 02:39:28,253
to fit the hats of the fathers
on to the heads of the children..,

1971
02:39:28,486 --> 02:39:30,830
and raising
them up as Pappus!

1972
02:39:32,123 --> 02:39:38,199
Children should prove themselves
that they are the true successors.

1973
02:39:38,262 --> 02:39:39,935
So,

1974
02:39:40,064 --> 02:39:48,064
I have the responsibility to make my
own son stand away from power now.

1975
02:39:51,209 --> 02:39:52,586
Then who else?

1976
02:39:53,210 --> 02:39:57,090
I shouldn't be deciding that.

1977
02:39:58,015 --> 02:40:02,830
That should be decided by
you, the people who voted.

1978
02:40:02,854 --> 02:40:05,892
Who should be leading you?

1979
02:40:06,123 --> 02:40:09,127
Who should be your Chief Minister?

1980
02:40:13,331 --> 02:40:15,743
<i>Kammaran</i> Ayya!

1981
02:40:15,799 --> 02:40:18,837
It's me, Murugeshan from Am ruthasamduram.
Don't you remember me?

1982
02:40:18,903 --> 02:40:20,507
Did you forget me?

1983
02:40:20,971 --> 02:40:24,282
We know very well how much
you toiled for this land!

1984
02:40:25,576 --> 02:40:27,647
Didn't he die then?

1985
02:40:28,746 --> 02:40:30,885
You should be the next Chief Minister!

1986
02:40:31,716 --> 02:40:34,890
Long Live... Chief Minister
Kammaran Nambiar..!!

1987
02:40:34,985 --> 02:40:37,124
Long Live... Chief Minister
Kammaran Nambiar..!!

1988
02:40:37,221 --> 02:40:42,136
Long Live... Chief Minister
Kammaran Nambiar..!!

1989
02:40:42,160 --> 02:40:49,100
Long Live... Chief Minister
Kammaran Nambiar..!!

1990
02:40:49,166 --> 02:40:52,875
Freedom fighter Kammaran Nam biar
is the Chief Minister of Kerala.

1991
02:40:52,970 --> 02:40:56,110
The ILP front meeting at
Thiruvananthapuram...

1992
02:40:56,174 --> 02:40:59,314
unanimously selected Kammaran
Nambiar as the Chief Minister.

1993
02:40:59,644 --> 02:41:01,317
Let it go on like this
for the time being.

1994
02:41:01,379 --> 02:41:03,256
Kammarettan won't
be around for long.

1995
02:41:03,314 --> 02:41:04,292
We'll sort it out.

1996
02:41:04,715 --> 02:41:08,162
Just pressurize Siju & Rajappan
& we'll get them on our side.

1997
02:41:09,087 --> 02:41:10,998
The old man isn't
like how you think.

1998
02:41:11,189 --> 02:41:12,600
He is like Bheeshma!

1999
02:41:12,857 --> 02:41:14,700
He himself has to decide
when he should die.

2000
02:41:14,758 --> 02:41:17,364
Last month when I took him for
a check up, the doctor said"

2001
02:41:17,595 --> 02:41:20,269
.. that he has the heart of an 18 year old
<i>&</i> blood pressure of a 21 year old.

2002
02:41:20,331 --> 02:41:21,308
How's he going to die?

2003
02:41:21,332 --> 02:41:24,370
But he's 96 years old, right?
Isn't he human? Shouldn't he die?

2004
02:41:24,635 --> 02:41:25,875
We'll have to beat him to death.

2005
02:41:26,904 --> 02:41:28,281
Will you stand with me?

2006
02:41:36,714 --> 02:41:38,694
Kammaretta, we won!

2007
02:41:39,684 --> 02:41:43,029
As all of us wished, you became
the Chief Minister as well.

2008
02:41:46,090 --> 02:41:49,697
I've made a list of things that we
have to do first. I'll read it out.

2009
02:41:50,828 --> 02:41:53,832
Say it during the speech
after the assembly meeting.

2010
02:41:54,699 --> 02:41:57,680
We will correct the erratic liquor
policy of the earlier governments.

2011
02:41:58,769 --> 02:42:01,113
Instead of changing the liquor
policy with every ministry",

2012
02:42:01,172 --> 02:42:04,016
we will make a permanent
liquor policy for the state.

2013
02:42:04,075 --> 02:42:10,657
Just bluff that you'll do everything to
lead the people to abstinence from liquor

2014
02:42:10,681 --> 02:42:11,659
Okay.

2015
02:42:11,716 --> 02:42:13,093
Let me see that once.

2016
02:42:16,687 --> 02:42:18,223
Francis...
- Yes..

2017
02:42:18,856 --> 02:42:21,894
I am not that old Kammaran, now.

2018
02:42:22,693 --> 02:42:27,233
I'm not the heroic Kammaran you
portrayed in the movie, either.

2019
02:42:27,932 --> 02:42:33,883
I'm a new Kammaran...
a public leader.

2020
02:42:34,772 --> 02:42:35,750
OOPs!

2021
02:42:37,842 --> 02:42:43,258
This Kammaran cannot look at a piece of
paper which looks like a grocery list",

2022
02:42:43,347 --> 02:42:48,922
and do things according
to your command.

2023
02:42:52,423 --> 02:42:53,401
First",

2024
02:42:54,025 --> 02:42:59,304
let me study about
the liquor policy.

2025
02:42:59,363 --> 02:43:02,442
What about us then?
After spending so much money...

2026
02:43:02,466 --> 02:43:03,444
Yes.

2027
02:43:04,001 --> 02:43:05,139
There's one way.

2028
02:43:07,838 --> 02:43:13,481
Create a communal riot or unleash violence
in the name of some random problem.

2029
02:43:14,311 --> 02:43:21,695
Or else, make some woman com plain that
the opposition leaders molested her.

2030
02:43:22,853 --> 02:43:26,892
Then both the media and the
people will go behind that.

2031
02:43:28,059 --> 02:43:29,868
In between all this ruckus,

2032
02:43:29,927 --> 02:43:31,838
we will make the liquor
policy permanent.

2033
02:43:31,963 --> 02:43:34,141
We'll keep all the bars open.

2034
02:43:34,165 --> 02:43:37,305
And many other things
will follow that"!

2035
02:43:37,768 --> 02:43:39,304
Such a shrewd brain!

2036
02:43:41,171 --> 02:43:42,980
You needn't sit again.
Carry on.

2037
02:43:48,179 --> 02:43:49,157
And...

2038
02:43:50,247 --> 02:43:51,817
it's not us..,

2039
02:43:52,349 --> 02:43:54,090
who won.

2040
02:43:56,020 --> 02:43:57,124
It's me!

2041
02:43:58,022 --> 02:43:59,160
This very me!

2042
02:43:59,924 --> 02:44:00,902
Kammaran!

2043
02:44:01,759 --> 02:44:03,397
Kammaran Nambiar!

2044
02:44:12,503 --> 02:44:13,881
Lost that money as well.

2045
02:44:13,905 --> 02:44:15,882
Are you happy now, Achayan?

2046
02:44:15,906 --> 02:44:18,051
He wants to study it, it seems!

2047
02:44:18,075 --> 02:44:21,352
I had warned you not to trust
this old bloke. Suffer now!

2048
02:44:21,546 --> 02:44:24,356
If things aren't sorted out
according to what we say",

2049
02:44:24,415 --> 02:44:27,094
I'll come wearing a belt
bomb like Lankan militants!

2050
02:44:27,118 --> 02:44:29,263
Then, I'll kill this bastard,
<i>&</i> end my life as well..!!

2051
02:44:29,287 --> 02:44:30,391
Talk softly!

2052
02:44:30,454 --> 02:44:33,100
I swear on my three children!

2053
02:44:33,124 --> 02:44:36,570
Achaya, he's not a Chief Minister.
He's a Thief Minister!

2054
02:44:36,594 --> 02:44:39,540
Will our matter be sorted out?
- Everything will be all right!

2055
02:44:39,564 --> 02:44:43,478
Ya right!
- Why can't you understand?

2056
02:44:46,370 --> 02:44:47,848
Here comes your director!

2057
02:44:47,872 --> 02:44:49,482
Hello sir.
- He came again?

2058
02:44:49,506 --> 02:44:52,214
Thank you so much forthe
'favour' you did for us.

2059
02:44:53,077 --> 02:44:56,456
Come. Let's go!

2060
02:44:56,581 --> 02:44:58,561
Kammaran sir..
Greetings.

2061
02:45:02,420 --> 02:45:03,990
Pulikesi.
Director.

2062
02:45:06,390 --> 02:45:09,837
When I saw that beard and hair, I
couldn't recognize you".

2063
02:45:09,894 --> 02:45:11,373
Sit down.
- Thank you sir.

2064
02:45:12,263 --> 02:45:15,870
A film of yours became
successful because of me, right?

2065
02:45:16,934 --> 02:45:17,912
Yes.

2066
02:45:18,235 --> 02:45:22,513
Why did you want
to meet me alone?

2067
02:45:24,442 --> 02:45:25,418
Just like that.

2068
02:45:25,442 --> 02:45:27,251
I just wanted to meet
you and wish you.

2069
02:45:28,445 --> 02:45:31,255
You're the Chief Minister now, right?

2070
02:45:31,348 --> 02:45:33,294
When everyone forced
me, what could I do...

2071
02:45:35,586 --> 02:45:39,591
Kammaran sir, I'm planning to make
your story into a Tamil movie now.

2072
02:45:42,193 --> 02:45:43,433
You don't worry at all.

2073
02:45:43,594 --> 02:45:45,437
I'll see to it that your
name is not damaged.

2074
02:45:46,964 --> 02:45:50,411
But to make this story
as a film in Tamil",

2075
02:45:50,935 --> 02:45:52,608
I need to know the
real end, to the story.

2076
02:45:53,304 --> 02:45:54,282
Real story.

2077
02:45:54,605 --> 02:45:56,607
Didn't I ask you that day itself?

2078
02:45:57,174 --> 02:45:58,448
What happened to Othenan?

2079
02:46:01,145 --> 02:46:02,590
Othenan Nam biar.

2080
02:46:03,214 --> 02:46:04,318
Do you remember, sir?

2081
02:46:13,157 --> 02:46:16,001
Slogan: "Somewhere down in the South.."

2082
02:46:16,060 --> 02:46:18,904
Slogan: "At the shore of waves"

2083
02:46:18,996 --> 02:46:21,067
Slogan: "When her
husband was not around..."

2084
02:46:21,132 --> 02:46:22,133
Don't worry.

2085
02:46:22,199 --> 02:46:23,610
Slogan : "The Government that burned
Glory, a pregnant lady"

2086
02:46:23,634 --> 02:46:25,477
I haven't come to kill you.

2087
02:46:27,371 --> 02:46:31,979
And not to tell the people that
you betrayed me and my Movement.

2088
02:46:43,654 --> 02:46:45,190
Why did you come here now?

2089
02:46:46,057 --> 02:46:47,161
What if someone sees you?

2090
02:46:47,358 --> 02:46:49,167
There are C
D's all over.

2091
02:46:49,360 --> 02:46:50,532
Who will see me?

2092
02:46:51,629 --> 02:46:52,972
Who will they see?

2093
02:46:54,632 --> 02:46:56,509
Only you know me.

2094
02:46:58,235 --> 02:46:59,339
And only 
.. KNOW you!

2095
02:47:02,440 --> 02:47:04,181
Let's move there.

2096
02:47:08,179 --> 02:47:10,523
India got Independence,
it seems!

2097
02:47:12,717 --> 02:47:14,424
It's a huge country now!

2098
02:47:15,552 --> 02:47:17,361
'Food' for everyone,

2099
02:47:17,989 --> 02:47:19,696
'Shelter' for everyone.

2100
02:47:20,391 --> 02:47:22,564
'Equality'.
'Impartiality'.

2101
02:47:24,729 --> 02:47:27,938
We used to fight for justice back then.

2102
02:47:29,500 --> 02:47:30,444
But, today?

2103
02:47:37,441 --> 02:47:40,251
When they tortured me in
the cells of Andaman",

2104
02:47:40,745 --> 02:47:44,716
I wished to stay alive
because of only one desire.

2105
02:47:45,216 --> 02:47:47,389
A desire to see someone.

2106
02:47:51,422 --> 02:47:52,400
<i>Kammaran",</i>

2107
02:47:52,790 --> 02:47:54,770
do you know
where Bhanu is, now?

2108
02:47:59,764 --> 02:48:01,368
I need Bhanu.

2109
02:48:02,366 --> 02:48:04,039
She is all I need!

2110
02:48:05,303 --> 02:48:06,281
Tell me.

2111
02:48:07,405 --> 02:48:08,713
Where is Bhanu now?

2112
02:48:09,573 --> 02:48:10,677
Bhanumathi...

2113
02:48:12,409 --> 02:48:13,752
is my wife now.

2114
02:48:16,614 --> 02:48:18,560
She's the mother of my child.

2115
02:48:19,784 --> 02:48:21,491
You traitor!

2116
02:48:28,726 --> 02:48:30,399
Yes. I am a traitor!

2117
02:48:31,629 --> 02:48:35,809
What else can a Nambiar, who was
born at Traitor's hill, be..,

2118
02:48:35,833 --> 02:48:37,369
other than a traitor?

2119
02:48:38,636 --> 02:48:40,479
You might remember, Othenan"

2120
02:48:41,572 --> 02:48:45,076
That night, when I told you about
my father's story atop hill.

2121
02:48:46,477 --> 02:48:50,357
Didn't I tell you that my father's body,
which was half-eaten by the river fish",

2122
02:48:50,581 --> 02:48:52,720
was found in
the river Kabani?

2123
02:48:53,817 --> 02:48:55,228
I'll tell you the rest.

2124
02:48:56,820 --> 02:49:00,461
I swore touching that rotten
head of his on that day",

2125
02:49:00,825 --> 02:49:03,499
that I'll destroy everything that
belongs to Malayil Nambiar.

2126
02:49:04,328 --> 02:49:05,806
You were everything
to him, Othenan!

2127
02:49:05,830 --> 02:49:07,138
Weren't you..?

2128
02:49:07,799 --> 02:49:11,178
I made your Bhanu mine!

2129
02:49:11,636 --> 02:49:12,637
Kammaran!

2130
02:49:13,237 --> 02:49:17,686
Kammaran has never returned
anything that he has stolen.

2131
02:49:19,543 --> 02:49:21,454
Except for the promises he made.

2132
02:49:42,233 --> 02:49:43,211
Kammaran sir,

2133
02:49:44,402 --> 02:49:45,380
Kammaran sir!

2134
02:49:46,904 --> 02:49:48,542
You didn't say anything.

2135
02:49:49,207 --> 02:49:50,379
Did you see Othenan after that?

2136
02:49:55,379 --> 02:49:56,722
Pulikesi,

2137
02:49:57,581 --> 02:49:59,891
I narrated my story to you.

2138
02:50:00,117 --> 02:50:01,221
That's a fact.

2139
02:50:01,586 --> 02:50:05,625
You added a lot of masala and
made it into a movie...,

2140
02:50:05,690 --> 02:50:07,533
in your own style.

2141
02:50:08,526 --> 02:50:10,301
The people... believed it.

2142
02:50:11,496 --> 02:50:13,237
Now you needn't change it.

2143
02:50:14,565 --> 02:50:16,476
What I said... was the truth.

2144
02:50:16,801 --> 02:50:19,111
Whatever the public
believed... is also the truth.

2145
02:50:20,571 --> 02:50:22,482
And this is called...

2146
02:50:22,540 --> 02:50:24,144
HISTORY...!!

2147
02:50:27,679 --> 02:50:35,598
There's something that all my
predecessors on this chair did.

2148
02:50:35,820 --> 02:50:37,595
I also must do it.

2149
02:50:39,257 --> 02:50:41,533
Forget the roads I travelled,
to reach here..!!

2150
02:50:45,196 --> 02:50:47,198
Now that Kammaran has arrived",

2151
02:50:47,765 --> 02:50:51,212
he has to get Kerala sorted..!!

2152
02:50:54,805 --> 02:50:56,876
The time is perfect..!!

2153
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:06,645
