1
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,283
You... - Yes me

2
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:34,450
Foolish fellow, at least allow
the people in the house to...

3
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,518
...live peacefully. I have to study
in life. -Shut up

4
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,789
I may become quiet but your dad
that is my uncle won't be quiet

5
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,295
Uncle's son.. - I am not his son
but you are uncle's son.

6
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,772
I am his nephew and he is
waiting in the hall for you.

7
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,981
You keep dancing to English tunes,
listen to me also at times.

8
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:06,188
Meaning - Do some work? Go
and submit this tender.

9
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,990
Impossible, dad. I have to go
for some very important work.

10
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:13,690
What work?...Having fun with
friends and dance in the clubs..

11
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:18,099
...and spend money like water.
- You're again after my son.

12
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:22,333
Why don't tell your nephew
to do some work?

13
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,033
He is the only one who comes
first in the college every year

14
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,374
...and brings glory to our
family name.

15
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,705
And this fellow is not worried
about anything.

16
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:35,778
This tender is for 50 lakhs.
Today is last date for submission

17
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,912
it is necessary that it gets
submitted today only.

18
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,354
Don't stare at me and stand.
Go now.

19
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,490
Take this, son
Go now.

20
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,262
Shantidevi, if you keep pampering
your son like this...

21
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,327
...when will he realize his
responsibilities.

22
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,897
See, I have no time for these
useless matters.

23
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,308
I have to give lecture on
Women & their responsibilities

24
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:04,075
...in the Ladies Club meeting
today.

25
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,747
Women & their responsibilities
and you... - Shut up!

26
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:14,418
She has no brains but she has
gone to show the way to others

27
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:20,029
My youthful and dear nephew...
- You here at this time.

28
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,866
Nephew, I have come to take you
only. Where are you going?

29
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,760
Daddy has told me to submit
this tender

30
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:28,767
You should just listen to the old
men but not do the work.

31
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,331
And today a great beauty
is waiting there and...

32
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,776
...seeing her, our eyes will
be amazed.

33
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,409
Then why the delay? Let us go.
- Let us go

34
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:49,885
Listen...

35
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:11,840
Hey Mister...

36
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,818
Did you say something to me?

37
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,413
No, I told these trees. Don't
you have other work?

38
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,416
What do you mean? - Why did
you throw this flower on me?

39
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:27,264
You are mistaken. - I know
street rogues like you very well

40
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,024
You are highly insolent.

41
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,259
I have been addressing you with
respect for so long but you...

42
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,235
...are insulting me. What do you
think of yourself?

43
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,030
Do you think you are an angelic
beauty that I throw flowers on U

44
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,703
I know girls like you
very well.

45
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,510
When nobody notices you in the
college, you come like this...

46
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,768
on some pretext or other.

47
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:45,441
Try this trick on someone else.
Now go away from here.

48
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,809
Unnecessarily you wasted
my study time.

49
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,849
You..
I will also see you...

50
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,424
Strange!

51
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:06,665
Oh, my love, what style?
- So this was your great work.

52
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,873
Be quiet! You unnecessarily drove
away that beauty.

53
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,666
If you say so, shall I
call her back.

54
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:16,040
Yes, call her. None of these
girls bother to look at me.

55
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,049
She will go away. You call her
fast. - I will call her.

56
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,022
We had lots of fun
that day.

57
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,294
Uncle Rakesh, did you get hold
of one or not?

58
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:42,405
That girl had killing looks but
I was not lucky.

59
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,107
Sir, I got this envelope.
Is this yours?

60
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,246
Yes. Where did you get it?

61
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:57,745
Somebody dropped it and went. I
tried to stop him, but he went off

62
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,357
You don't know the big loss
from which you've saved me.

63
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,888
Take this...
Keep this, daughter.

64
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,355
No, when you called me as
daughter, don't give me tips...

65
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,330
...but give your blessings.

66
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:13,029
Be happy always, daughter.
What is your name?

67
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,367
Sita - Wah! Your virtues are
also like your good name only.

68
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,436
Where do you live?- Sakar
Society, Kiranagar. I will leave.

69
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:30,019
First tell me, how much you
spent on sarees-Only 1200 rupees

70
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,380
Shobha, you know very well that
my salary is only 1500 rupees.

71
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:37,826
From that, you've spent 1200 for
sarees. If you always spend like..

72
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,886
...this, how will we meet the
other expenses of the household

73
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,927
Money! Money! Money! Where have
I given cash and bought this?

74
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,698
I have got this on credit
only.

75
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,966
Taking loan is the first
step of weakness.

76
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,937
Is it? Then what is the
last step...-Disaster!

77
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,341
Then you also listen. My dad's
house is very wealthy.

78
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,843
I don't even spit on such
sarees.

79
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,322
Sudhirkumar, if you did not have
the capacity to even buy...

80
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,418
...two ordinary sarees, why did
you marry my daughter?

81
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,190
My fate is only unfortunate.

82
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,926
How many times we have told
you to quit this job of uniform...

83
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,969
...and join in our business.

84
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,970
I don't want to sell my prestige
& live on the alms of my in-laws

85
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,804
Come, daughter. This house is
not fit for you to live now.

86
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:33,211
And listen. When you become
capable of buying happiness to...

87
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,445
...my daughter, then you come
to take her... Come.

88
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,891
Nephew, our sir was so
shaken...

89
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,221
Have you submitted the tender?
- Yes, dad...

90
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,858
Yes, brother-in-law. I also went
with him.

91
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,033
You know that I always complete
my work perfectly.

92
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,901
Yes, that is why it was
found on the road.

93
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,308
You already misguide my son and
now you try to deceive me too.

94
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,370
You are banned from coming to
this house but you still come...

95
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,109
...without shame with my son
again and again.

96
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,880
You start abusing as soon
as you see my brother.

97
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,515
He just dropped an envelope. Has
your property been ruined?

98
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,985
Shanti...-You shut up. I don't
want to hear anything.

99
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:18,956
You both go freshen up & get
ready. I will serve food for you.

100
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,122
Yes, sister...
- Go

101
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,268
Shobha, why are you still
standing there?

102
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,231
Don't be scared.
lam still alive.'

103
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,140
Go to my room.

104
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,006
Shantidevi, going frequently to
daughter's house like this...

105
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,345
...and spoiling the couple's
happiness is not good.

106
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,548
I know what is good and
bad very well.

107
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,053
I don't know what will happen
to this house.'

108
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:54,198
God, do you know! No...
Then how will I know?

109
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,936
Mr. Satish, you are in my house.
- Rakesh, one problem came up.

110
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,937
Painting work is going on
in my house and...

111
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,275
...my daughter's teacher came to
teach him. Hence in your house...

112
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,078
Mr. Satish, this is also like your
house. Then, what is the problem?

113
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,220
I am feeling very thirsty.
- Is it?

114
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,824
I will get water for you.

115
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:40,773
Baby, are you feeling very
thirsty. Yes, it is very hot.

116
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,109
Your thirst won't get quenched
with water.

117
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,080
You take this money and go
down and have ice cream

118
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:50,917
Have lots of ice creams & don't
come very soon. Good child.

119
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:00,224
Greetings! -Who are you?
Where has Munni gone?

120
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,095
And why did you close
this door?

121
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,992
You teach the children
so well.

122
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,332
Today you teach me also the
lessons of youth.

123
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,805
Open! -Today I won't allow you
to go without taking my lesson

124
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,786
Now, I will study to
my heart's content.

125
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,219
Teacher, now the bell
has not rung.

126
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,433
Please forgive me...
Forgive me.

127
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,800
A woman is not so weak that a
demon like you can swallow her.

128
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,908
She is not G for girl
but M for mother.

129
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,985
This kurta is for me that
too in silk. -Yes.

130
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,854
It looks that while distributing
brains to everyone in the..

131
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,152
...world, you have lost
your own wisdom.

132
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:06,158
Grandpa - This is an ordinary
cotton saree.

133
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,762
Can't you buy silk sarees for
yourself?

134
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,933
Grandpa, what difference does it
make if the saree is cotton or..

135
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:15,461
...silk. Our culture is reflected
in the same way.

136
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,071
What a great thing to say,
daughter?

137
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,140
Sir, you.. please come.
Grandpa, he is...

138
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,078
Are you not Master Ramdas?
- Yes, but you...

139
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,875
I am Ghanshyam from Shivpur.
I am your student.

140
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,716
Ghanshyam.. Ghanu.
May you live long, son.

141
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,520
It looks as if you have
become a very great man.

142
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,291
Nothing like that, sir. It is all
your blessings. - Bless you.

143
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:46,793
You don't know but your daughter
has saved me from losing...

144
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,533
...lakhs of rupees. Hence, I
brought a small gift for her.

145
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,933
Take this and
keep this, daughter.

146
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,499
There is no necessity for this.

147
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,746
Sir, you tell her to keep this.

148
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,908
Keep it, daughter

149
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,244
He is a very favourite
student of mine.

150
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:05,947
Keep this.

151
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,167
What happened?

152
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,771
Uncle, this is what is called the
shock of youth.

153
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:28,904
Yes, shock of 440 volts. She
can't be convinced. Let us go.

154
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:29,946
Is it so? Hold this.

155
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:35,147
Let me also see the
current in her youth.

156
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:39,815
He will get beaten as I have
got beaten before.

157
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,457
What are you girls
doing here?

158
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,867
There is a fantastic program
in Sea Breeze

159
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,101
Why don't you all come with
me?

160
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,468
Shall we go?
- Yes, let us go.

161
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,833
You also come..
- You all go.

162
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,441
You also come along- No,
I cannot come.

163
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,881
Why? - I have my own
principles.

164
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:13,084
Is it? These principles are sold
in every street corner, madam.

165
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,226
Only lowly people must be
buying them.

166
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,086
I don't go anywhere with
strangers.

167
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:22,131
Make them your own at times,
madam. Come on, darling!

168
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:28,168
I think this slap is enough
to bring to your senses.

169
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,508
Being your student, instead of
giving you fees, I have...

170
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,408
...come to ask you for something
today.

171
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,410
I did not understand anything,
son.

172
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:44,351
I have come to ask for the hand
of Sita for my son Prakash.

173
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,910
Mr. Ghanshyam, have you come
to joke on my poverty. -No..

174
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:59,863
I have got crores of wealth but
no treasure of culture.

175
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:04,971
And your daughter Sita is an
ideal epitome of culture, sir.

176
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:09,140
But this culture is not enough
to get her married, son.

177
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,214
I don't need anything.

178
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:17,380
If you accept my request, I will
think that you did a great favour

179
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:22,950
Have heard about Sudama going
to Lord Krishna's palace?

180
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:26,493
But today I saw for the first
time that Krishna came...

181
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,359
to Sudama's hut. Yes,
for the first time...

182
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,759
Shall I consider this alliance
as fixed then? - Yes

183
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,299
Then please come with daughter
Sita to my house definitely.

184
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:07,392
Welcome... My love has come to
me by getting stuck in flowers.

185
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,070
What is this insolence?

186
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,171
You did not like that one flower
I threw on you that day.

187
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,975
Hence, I've arranged for this
flowery bed for the beauty queen

188
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,676
So, it was your doing that day.
- Yes.

189
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,948
Please give a kiss to
your lover, baby.

190
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,262
Till you don't get your kicks,
your youthful shocks won't go

191
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,130
Move away...
- You get lost.

192
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:22,075
I will deal with you
afterwards.

193
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,874
Yes, you are born only to
get kicked by me. See and go.

194
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,454
What are you staring at?

195
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,926
Like a film's hero and heroine,
two fools are showing...

196
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,398
...trailor on the road.

197
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,964
Children, all of you
close your eyes.

198
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,300
You should not see this,
as this is a adult's scene.

199
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,000
We should only see this,
darling.

200
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,836
What do you know
about love?

201
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,379
See, the children are
smarter than you.

202
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,682
Love is done by a
proper man.

203
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:02,911
Why, am I not a man?

204
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,380
These Pandavas have not been
born just like that.

205
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:10,123
These are not borrowed but
from my own efforts. - Shut up!

206
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,794
Let us go now!
- Yes, I am coming

207
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,893
These Pandavas have started
searching for Draupadi.

208
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:22,102
Strange children! Suddenly they
laugh and suddenly they dance.

209
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,438
...and suddenly they are angry.
What all they show?

210
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,077
See in front and drive and
you will cause an accident.

211
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,671
I am looking at an accident
which has already happened.

212
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,683
Hey, gardener! ls your master
at home?

213
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,222
Why are you staring like that?
Have you never seen a girl?

214
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,232
I am asking you whether
Mr. Prakash is at home.

215
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:05,246
My dear sister, if Sonia becomes
the daughter-in-law of this...

216
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,945
...house, then you will have
a fan made in gold.

217
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:16,286
Hello, Sonia - Hi, Rakesh...
Come... Come...

218
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,259
She is Prakash's mother,
Shantidevi - Hello

219
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,924
She is Prakash's sister Shobha
- Hello

220
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,733
This is Sonia...- Beautiful!
Hi Sonia...- Hi, Prakash...

221
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,939
Rakesh was praising you
a lot.

222
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,302
He was right. A daughter-in-law
should be like this only.

223
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:39,010
Shantidevi... you do not see the
face of the daughter-in-law

224
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,017
...but you should watch
her steps.

225
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,012
He is my father..
- What?

226
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:49,258
He... but I thought he was the
gardener of this house.

227
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,490
You thought rightly. The one who
maintains the house is...

228
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,792
...known as the gardener only
and a good gardener can...

229
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:58,027
...differentiate the flowers &
thorns perfectly. Isn't it, uncle?

230
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,795
Absolutely right, nephew.

231
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:03,932
I'm sorry, old man. Let us go for
a compromise - Shut up!

232
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,244
You chit of a girl, you
dared to do this.

233
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,107
So much insult to me.

234
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:14,316
Prakash, Rakesh.. it is very
difficult for me to stay here.

235
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,047
I will remove your difficulty
very easily. Anyway...

236
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,247
...you are not fit to become the
daughter-in-law of this house.

237
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,820
Uncle, I will show her the way to
go outside. Come...

238
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,218
One minute... Take this specimen
also outside.

239
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,422
Will you come quietly or want
some youthful shocks?

240
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,468
What have you done, dad?
- I have done correctly.

241
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,006
A girl in such scanty clothes
can't become my daughter-in-law

242
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,205
And listen, you will stay here
only tomorrow.

243
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,109
I have already spoken about your
alliance in one place and...

244
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,944
...they are coming to see you
- But dad... - You can go.

245
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,511
I don't want to hear
anything else.

246
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,316
Who is that girl?

247
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,483
She is the granddaughter of my
Guru Ramdas.

248
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,924
Is she cultured? - Yes, much
better cultured than you.

249
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:56,922
What about money?

250
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:00,891
Aunty, culture is not
the property of the rich.

251
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,163
You and your uncle do
anything but my son...

252
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,498
...will bring the girl of
my choice.

253
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:11,735
Aunty, uncle wants a daughter-
in-law for this house and...

254
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,004
...not a cabaret dancer.

255
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,973
Shut up!
Come... Shobha

256
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:25,982
Amar, when God was distributing
brains, where was your aunt then?

257
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,756
Yes, where was she?

258
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:31,483
She must have been sleeping.
- Yes, she was sleeping

259
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,999
A cycle in silver with
a golden seat...

260
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:15,937
...let us go doubles in
this, darling.

261
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:25,014
A cycle in silver with
a golden seat...

262
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:29,982
...let us go doubles in
this, darling.

263
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,473
I am an youth and you
are also one

264
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,944
Tell me, where we
should go.

265
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:39,485
You and I have come to
the village of Gokul

266
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:44,785
I will play the flute
under the shade of trees

267
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:53,032
You and I have come to
the village of Gokul.

268
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,902
I will play the flute
under the shade of trees

269
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:03,412
You are Govinda and
lam your Radha.

270
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:08,676
Let us dance on the
banks of Yamuna river.

271
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:16,425
Our love cannot be broken
for many births.

272
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:19,485
Let us go doubles in
the cycle, darling.

273
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:35,141
Listen, will you take me
to the place I want to go.

274
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,508
You just ask and see.

275
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,075
Where the season is moist and
only you and I are there.

276
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,954
Rains are pouring down water
from the sky.

277
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,719
My youth is getting drenched.

278
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:36,130
Rains are pouring down water
from the sky.

279
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:41,109
My youth is getting drenched.

280
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:46,081
My growing youth has
become like fire.

281
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:51,917
Please embrace me,
my love

282
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:58,485
The lightning is dancing and
cloud is singing our song.

283
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:03,231
Let us go doubles in
the cycle, darling

284
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:07,734
A cycle in silver with
a golden seat...

285
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:12,070
...let us go doubles in
this, darling.

286
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,848
When did you come?
Greetings! - Greetings!

287
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,860
He is my son, Prakash.
- Be happy, son.

288
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,159
Please sit.

289
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,928
<i>Ramdasji, daughter Ska
has not come.</i>

290
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:44,763
Exams for children are
going on in her school.

291
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:51,413
But I got her photo.
Take this.

292
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,843
Please give it. Let me also
see how beautiful my would be...

293
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,715
...sister-in-law is?

294
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,023
Brother, take this and
see it properly.

295
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:13,068
This slap should be enough
to bring you to your senses.

296
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,936
Is she your daughter?
- Yes, son.

297
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,370
I accept to this marriage.

298
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,452
Shobha fights with her
husband for small things.

299
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,490
Now your aunt has brought her
here from her husband's house.

300
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,821
I can't face Sudhir at all now.

301
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,122
Amar, you somehow convince
Sudhir to come to...

302
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,463
...Prakash's wedding.

303
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:48,266
Don't worry, uncle. I will
convince brother Sudhir

304
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,366
Your aunt is the cause of
all these problems.

305
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,734
I don't know, how her parents
named her as Shanti.-By mistake

306
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,975
I am coming. You always come
like the cyclone.

307
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,218
Come, wash the clothes first.

308
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,717
I will just come.

309
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:11,050
Wait, madam. Do you keep the
guests waiting at the doors.

310
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,823
You have come here also
behind me.

311
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,455
What to do? The shadow goes
in the front & the sun follows

312
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,997
Is it? What if the sun is before
you?- Then the shadow'll follow

313
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:22,198
Interesting! - But you tell me
who is in fault in this.

314
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,938
Sun or the shadow - Both.
- Then why wait?

315
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,033
Who is it, Asha?

316
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,742
Greetings, brother-in-law
- You, Amar.

317
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:36,913
How is everyone at home?
- First class - Come and sit.

318
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,015
Tell me, how you came?

319
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:46,127
Brother, me and uncle are very
ashamed of Shobha's behaviour.

320
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:51,189
Anyway, uncle remembers
you a lot.

321
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,701
As per his request, I've come to
invite you for Prakash's wedding

322
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,472
This is the card.
- Thank you.

323
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:04,410
Let me introduce you
- There is no need for that

324
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:09,148
The whole college knows her.
- Means, you've met each other.

325
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,409
We are in the same college.

326
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:14,422
He is your sister-in-law's
cousin. - Cousin!

327
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,018
Then what is he doing here.

328
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,764
See Asha, like all the fingers
in the hand are not the same...

329
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,357
...every member of a family
are not alike.

330
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:28,070
You were not here during my
marriage and hence you...

331
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,833
...do not know Amar but Amar is
a very lively young man.

332
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,409
Anyway, when uncle has invited
me with so much love and...

333
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:35,773
...respect, I will surely come for
the marriage - Surely!

334
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:37,474
OK, I will leave now.

335
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,417
Yes, police officers have to
be very strict about timing

336
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,286
And listen, Amar has come to
our house after a long time.

337
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,325
There should be no lacking
in attending to him. OK.

338
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:56,430
What are you seeing?

339
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,930
Just seeing how fast people
change to worse and say...

340
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,334
...what work has he got here

341
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,464
Anyway, what did your
brother say?

342
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,937
There should be no lacking
in attending to this guest.

343
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,372
So, my guest, how should
I serve you.

344
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:16,853
How?...
Like this"

345
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:42,738
The house where I live
will become my world.

346
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:49,046
That will be my temple
and my prayers will be there.

347
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:55,018
This is the voice of my
heart-beat

348
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:07,259
Please show mercy on me.
I only trust you.

349
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:16,308
You are only my mother
and you are my father.

350
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:22,477
Show mercy on me as I
only trust you.

351
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,394
Brother-in-law has made
that girl as your...

352
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,434
...daughter-in-law against your
wishes and put her on Ur head.

353
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,964
So what? Mummy is still the
mistress of this house.

354
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,370
What sort of mistress?
She is mean and lazy...

355
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,540
Wash utensils & clothes... why're
you standing? Press my legs.

356
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,507
What are you blabbering?

357
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:54,815
I am not saying this. This will
be told by your daughter-in-law

358
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:59,211
If you grumble, she will
kick you out of the house.

359
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,088
Is it so, my good brother?

360
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:06,327
Listen to this. Wherever that girl
drank water from..

361
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,263
...I have washed my clothes
in that river.

362
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,161
Welcome...Welcome...
Welcome...

363
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:21,069
Let me also see if this face
is fit for this family or not.

364
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:29,475
Wah!- You...-Yes, it is me. Did I
not tell you that principles are...

365
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,448
...bought in every corner.

366
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:40,128
Listen! Let us start a new life.
Please forget the past.

367
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:43,366
OK, I will forget it, if you
say so.

368
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:01,278
This is to answer your
slap.

369
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:05,852
Now you rot in the four walls of
this house throughout your life

370
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:10,091
Listen! This is gross
injustice.

371
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,860
Prakash, what happened?
Where are you going?-To hell

372
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,063
Only hell is left for those
who leave heaven and go.

373
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,268
I don't have the habit of
debating with people...

374
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,171
...who eat on the bits
we throw.

375
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,904
What has happened
to this Prakash?

376
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,371
What did you say? Did Prakash
leave the house and go..

377
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,246
...on his first night.

378
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,476
Yes. Mummy, this is the
chance to take revenge.

379
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,413
Good morning, sister-in-law.
Where is Prakash?

380
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,283
He is sleeping.
- Sleeping!

381
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:51,223
A good person can correct the
bad habits of an evil man.

382
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,424
But he should not try
to hide it.

383
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:59,374
Amar, I am not at fault for
whatever happened yesterday.

384
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:04,145
Sister-in-law, you are that
mirror in which Uncle has...

385
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,876
...seen the sweet dream of
peace & prosperity in this house

386
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:12,177
But, I alone...- I am here to help
you at every stop.

387
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,953
Start your first day with
a smile.

388
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,990
Come on, laugh...
Laugh...

389
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,230
Daughter-in-law...

390
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,395
There your devilish aunt is
calling you - I will go.

391
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,972
What were you doing upstairs?
- I was...

392
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,836
Who will do the work
in the house? Your dad!

393
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,938
Your grandpa has not sent an
army of servants here.

394
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:43,046
Do you know to cook
anything? - Yes

395
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,014
Nothing ordinary is prepared
as food in this house.

396
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,313
The scent of richness comes
from our food also.

397
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:52,456
Take this list and
go to the kitchen.

398
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:58,262
Maharaj, Mali...
- Did you call us?

399
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:04,996
Yes. Maharaj, you will not
prepare the food today.- OK.

400
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:08,100
Both of you go for watching
cinema today.

401
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:24,722
Attention please. The king of
cooks, Amarkumar has come.

402
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,822
This is your BA pass cook and
brother-in-law I.e. two in one.

403
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,061
Today I will show the history
and geography of this kitchen

404
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:36,329
Open up, Simsam!
Yes...

405
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:41,369
These are all the spices
which are hot like this house.

406
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,841
These are all the vegetables
and this is the hot green...

407
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,143
...chilly which is foolish
like your sister-in-law.

408
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,776
And this is that historic knife
which is very sharp...

409
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,286
...like the tongue of
your mother-in-law

410
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:56,316
Amar, why are you taking so
much trouble for me?

411
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,985
Every sad Bhabi's only support
is always her brother-in-law.

412
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,288
So, shall we start!
- Yes

413
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,214
My God! She has prepared so
many items all alone.

414
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,777
Is she some magician?

415
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:02,286
Such fragrant food has never
been prepared in our home before

416
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,757
No need to talk too much.
Sit quietly and eat.

417
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,390
But Shantidevi, this
is a miracle.

418
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,199
Yes, a great miracle, uncle.
So many savouries along...

419
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:19,970
...with sweet. - Great! - This is
the magic of Bhabi's hands...

420
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,375
which is beyond comparison.

421
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:28,948
Is this a cold like.

422
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,777
Hot puris are being prepared
inside just like you.

423
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,990
Please bring hot puris
for aunt.

424
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,926
Take this.
Isn't this hot?

425
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,353
Shoba, you also eat.

426
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:42,855
You have started cooking on the
first day itself.

427
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,292
Where are the cook and
the servants?

428
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:49,460
Cook became sick against his
wishes and the servants...

429
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:50,900
...have been forcibly sent
to watch a movie.

430
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:54,132
All praise to Shobha!
- Amar...

431
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:58,437
Is this any food?- Mummy,
the vegetable is burnt.

432
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:02,182
Rice is not cooked properly
- There is salt in the dal

433
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,881
Is this the kind of food
you make?

434
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:08,184
If you can cook better than
Bhabhi why don't you go...

435
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,815
...to your in-law's place and
make food for your husband.

436
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,290
Such an insult to me.
I won't eat this food

437
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,755
You are right, daughter. We will
eat somewhere outside.

438
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,463
Where are so many delicacies
available outside, aunt?-Quiet!

439
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:25,206
Shantidevi, to leave a filled plate
& go is insult to God.-Shut up

440
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:31,442
She keeps insulting our God
day and night.

441
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,338
Let God alone save her.

442
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,809
Why do you get upset,
daughter-in-law?

443
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,113
I have not been able to make
your mother-in-law happy...

444
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,986
...for the last 30 years and
you have not been here...

445
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:42,990
...even for 30 hours now.

446
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,049
Sit now -Come and sit and have
the food.

447
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,956
Today we will enjoy food all
the more. That is the secret

448
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:48,822
Yes, definitely

449
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,966
This is called as the
real shock from a man.

450
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,869
All the pride of this lady has
gone to pieces by one slap

451
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:59,036
So what is the program,
uncle?

452
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:06,205
Prakash, one servant was
lacking in this house.

453
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,081
By bringing her, you have
fulfilled that lacking too.

454
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,978
To serve her husband is the
duty of a wife.

455
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:17,920
A wife is the mirror of her
husband and not his shadow.

456
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,963
You don't know that the wife is
the better half of her husband...

457
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,225
...and is called his Ardhangini

458
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:27,167
But what does a rogue know
about the comfort of family life?

459
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:30,103
Sita, what are you blabbering?
- Great, Prakash!

460
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:36,143
People call Ravan as evil but he
never raised his hand on Sita

461
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:41,008
Hey, Sita's Lakshman, stay
within your limits.

462
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,515
Dad has given him some rights
and so he has started thinking...

463
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:45,083
...that he is the master of
this house.

464
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:47,952
You have started thinking that
you are the master of this house

465
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,151
By listening to outsiders, are you
not ashamed to insult your...

466
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,488
...wife who is like a Goddess?

467
00:40:53,417 --> 00:41:00,164
Hey, are my kicks not registered
properly in your mind's computer

468
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:07,073
Even dumb fellows have started
giving shocks in this house. Come

469
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:22,754
Sita, I am Prakash speaking
- Wait, I will call mother.

470
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,418
I want to speak to you only
- With me...

471
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,288
Today evening, our friends have
organized a grand party...

472
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:31,731
...to celebrate our marriage.

473
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,826
You have not given me any
rights of a wife.

474
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,367
Won't you get insulted if
I come there?

475
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,273
Sita, you only said that we
should forget the past and...

476
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:44,108
...start a fresh life.
- I cannot come there.

477
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,076
If you don't come, I will be
insulted there, darling.

478
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:49,409
Won't you forgive me?

479
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,520
Then, shall I think that you
have forgiven me.

480
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:59,456
Yes, Sita. On my oath, will
you please come, Sita. - Yes

481
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,766
We will take revenge on Sita for
having insulted us.

482
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,495
Bhabhi.. one minute.

483
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:16,039
What is it? You are
looking very happy.

484
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:20,213
Today...-What happened today?
- There is a party to celebrate...

485
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,275
...the happiness of our marriage
and your brother has invited me.

486
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,380
A party and my brother has
called you...

487
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:28,986
Yes, just now he had called.
Everything has become all right

488
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,459
I am very happy today, Amar.
Very happy!

489
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:37,959
Bhabhi, I had started feeling that
He is not there - Who?- God!

490
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:42,227
He has listened to you. Great,
that means no worry forever now.

491
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:46,764
Wish you all the best.
Enjoy!

492
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,744
By seeing you happy for the first
time in this house, I feel happy.

493
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:59,755
What is it, you are dressed
so well?

494
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:04,155
Mother, he has called me
for the party today.

495
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:09,094
What? Aren't you ashamed?
Things for making pickle have...

496
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,726
...come to the house. Instead of
making it, she wants to go...

497
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,999
...to a party
- See her, mother.

498
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:19,366
Four sacks of things for making
pickle is in the kitchen.

499
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,274
You have to grind everything &
make it ready today only. Go...

500
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,504
Did you understand? I don't want
to hear anything. Come, Shobha.

501
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:30,952
He has called me for the first
time...-I don't want to hear.

502
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,084
If you don't grind the spices,
will your grandpa come...

503
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,317
...for that... - Or will your dad
come down from heaven.

504
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,953
Shobha...till today, I have never
refused to do any work.

505
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,223
Then why do you bring my dad
and grandpa's name in between.

506
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:45,163
Useless girl, you dare to
answer back.

507
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:51,370
Listen, before we come home,
the pickle spices should be

508
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:55,137
...prepared & ready or I
will grind you. Understood!

509
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,040
She won't go to the party
- Yes...- Come, mummy.

510
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:08,956
What happened? When I went
sometime back your face..

511
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,857
...was like a moon but why these
black clouds are seen now.

512
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:15,463
It looks like, I won't be able
to go to the party - Why?

513
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,230
Mother has left 4 sacks of
spices to be ground today only.

514
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,734
So that is the drama.

515
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:29,169
Don't worry. When will I be
of use to you, Bhabhi?

516
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,713
You will surely go to the
party.

517
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:35,012
Will I sayjust like that?
Now smile please

518
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:41,414
Don't worry now. I will just go
like this and come back.

519
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,359
Come now.

520
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:51,299
Come and give a hand

521
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:59,731
There are problems on
Bhabhi's head.

522
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:07,147
This is a very
difficult time

523
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,285
She has to go...

524
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,396
...and meet her lover.

525
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:26,733
Come...

526
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:32,363
Come and give a hand

527
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:03,796
Her mother-in-law is a
flower of bitter-gourd

528
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:11,339
Her sister-in-law pierces her
like the enemy.

529
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:24,454
Her mother-in-law is a
flower of bitter-gourd

530
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:28,026
Her sister-in-law pierces her
like the enemy.

531
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:32,932
Her father-in-law loves her
like her own father.

532
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:37,268
And brother-in-law pampers
her like her own brother

533
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,506
Her lover who is upset...

534
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:51,517
...has to be pacified today.

535
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,813
Come on...

536
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,454
Come and give a hand today.

537
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,989
My co-sister has a moon like
face.

538
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,325
My co-sister is like
a mother.

539
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:55,141
My co-sister has a moon like
face.

540
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:59,210
My co-sister is like
a mother.

541
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:05,123
Whenever I see you,
my mind says that...

542
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:09,028
...you are Sita Bhabhi and
lam your Lakhan.

543
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,159
Whenever you laugh...

544
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,978
Whenever you laugh, the
whole world will laugh with you

545
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,741
Come on...

546
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:31,885
Come and give a hand today.

547
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:36,186
Come and give a hand today.

548
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:31,177
Great, Bhabhi! Where are you
going with so much make-up?

549
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:34,078
Have you finished the work?
- No.. Yes..

550
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:38,108
What is this no and yes? Have
you finished the work or not?

551
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,951
Everything is kept inside.
You go and see.

552
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:44,225
Hey, listen... - She has gone
to the party in the end.

553
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:48,190
Come, let us go and see
what she has done.

554
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:51,023
This is great work.

555
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:53,428
Yes, this is a miracle.

556
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,062
Does this girl know some
black magic?

557
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,205
Mummy, I feel that she
is some witch.

558
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:03,308
Great speed, Shobha and Aunt!

559
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,178
How did both of you finish work
of 8 days in eight hours?

560
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,710
Our enemy can only do this
work... - That witch

561
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:09,950
Who is the witch! Is it
my aunt? -Yes

562
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,283
Are you a witch, aunt?
- Shut up!

563
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,921
You call aunt as a witch.
In this house, only Gods...

564
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,153
...Goddesses that of crime
stay.

565
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,770
Welcome! Welcome!

566
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:38,042
Friends, here comes our
most eagerly awaited guest.

567
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:44,143
Mrs.Prakash... that is Sitadevi,
a typical Indian lady.

568
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,130
Here comes my wife. Meet my
friend, Ashok Desai.

569
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,967
Hello...
- Namaste

570
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:05,906
Let us start to enjoy
Let us have some music

571
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,018
Mrs. Prakash, let us dance

572
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:31,431
Forgive me, I don't like
all this.

573
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:43,209
Sitaji, everybody is dancing
happily. Why not we?-I'm sorry

574
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:54,184
Come on, Sitadevi - Leave me...
Behave yourself.

575
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:59,887
My insult in my own party
- Mister..- Sorry, Prakash

576
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:05,761
Looks as if you have married
some 1936 model

577
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,835
You are right. Actually, instead
of coming to this party..

578
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:12,066
...she should have gone to
a temple Bhajan.

579
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:18,211
What does she know about the
culture of rich people like us?

580
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:22,983
Is showing your body like this
openly is your culture?

581
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,319
To dance in the arms of a
stranger, is this culture.

582
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:31,792
If this is your culture, to hell
with your culture and society.

583
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:37,029
Great, you came and spoiled
the party first.

584
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,089
Moreover, she is giving lectures
and you are listening.

585
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:45,268
I don't know why I called this
uncultured animal to this party.

586
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:51,836
Before I harm you, you get out.
I say.. get out.

587
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:04,217
Work is done.
Relax... nephew

588
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:08,823
Insult... insult..l knew that this
would happen with you.

589
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,466
How long will you burn in this
fire of injustice?

590
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:17,438
Bhabhi, if doing crime is sin, to
bear it is a greater sin.

591
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:21,804
But what do I do. I tolerate
in the hope that at least...

592
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,708
...some day happiness will come.

593
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:28,707
Such hopes of yours will not
come in this house in this way.

594
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:31,018
For that, you will have to
face these people bravely.

595
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:35,848
If I do that, this enmity
will only increase more.

596
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:38,057
Which enmity are you
talking about?

597
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:41,761
What is the use of this much
straight and good nature...

598
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,491
...if it stops yo_u from getting
your rights?

599
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,964
Bhabhi, if you stay like this
in this house, these people...

600
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:49,128
...will make your life
miserable.

601
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:55,138
There is still time. Open your
eyes and demand your rights

602
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,239
If it becomes late, you will
regret a lot. Regret too much!

603
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:06,947
Yes, I have told the cashier
not to give money to you.

604
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,988
But why?

605
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:14,225
The reason is that the company
has no money to give you for..

606
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,957
...wasting on street girls after
neglecting your goddess like wife

607
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,890
Bhabhi's supporter, how
dare you do this?

608
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,228
Enough, Prakash. This has
become too much now

609
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,237
I am the owner of this company.
Who are you?

610
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:28,242
Prakash, how will you know the
value of Lakshmi of the house...

611
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:30,437
...when you are licking
the shoes of lowly girls.

612
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,379
Will you give me money
or not?- Absolutely not

613
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:37,510
If you don't give me money in a
straight manner, remember...

614
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:42,019
...that I will take you
to the Court.

615
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:46,424
What? You will take your
father to Court.

616
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:51,021
What father and what relation?
I can do anything for money.

617
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,899
Now we will meet in the Court.

618
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,862
Uncle, I will call the doctor.

619
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:02,903
Fool, by the time, Court decides
your case, you will be a old man.

620
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:07,779
And what will happen to the
necklace you promised to Sonia.

621
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,078
Yes, you only give some idea.

622
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,753
When will your family necklace
lying just like that with Sita...

623
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,847
...be of use to you?

624
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:20,418
You are great.

625
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:26,194
Then brush your brains
and start your work.

626
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:33,302
Now see the play of youth.

627
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,907
What are you doing? You are
stealing in your own house.

628
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:13,272
You understand one thing.
If I don't get anything...

629
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:16,977
...then I snatch it.

630
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:27,460
What? That witch stole our
family necklace and went away.

631
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:32,064
I saw her handing over that
necklace to her grandpa...

632
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:36,161
...with my own eyes, dear
sister. You ask her yourself

633
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,036
Necklace is not with me.

634
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:44,305
Then where has it gone?
- I can't say that

635
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:48,406
Why don't you accept that you
have given that necklace...

636
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:50,417
...to that pauper grandpa of
yours for removing his poverty...

637
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:53,352
...on his instructions.
- Enough, mother!

638
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:57,120
Till today, I have tolerated
all your atrocities.

639
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,950
But I can't bear the false blame
on my grandpa.

640
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:05,188
Do you think that we are blind
and dare to stare at us?

641
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:07,692
First you steal and
than hide and justify it.

642
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,903
Useless, shameless girl, what do
you think of yourself?

643
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,775
Shanti... please don't beat
her for God's sake.

644
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:21,445
Leave her.
Shanti, Shobha... leave her

645
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:39,761
Both of you tortured our
daughter-in-law a lot.

646
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:43,693
God will never forgive you.
Neveﬂ

647
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:50,235
I have pushed you into this hell.
Please forgive me, daughter.

648
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:52,778
Please forgive me, daughter.

649
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:03,885
Father...

650
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:09,192
I have earned all my property
with my hard work.

651
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:13,657
Hence, I am distributing it as per
my wish.

652
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,999
I am writing half of the property
in the name of my...

653
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,063
...late brother's son, Amar
and the other half...

654
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:24,805
...in the name of my
daughter-in-law, Sita.

655
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,207
The Bungalow will be in the
name of Shantidevi and...

656
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:32,446
...Prakash will take Rs. 5000 per
month from my daughter-in-law...

657
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:33,710
...for his monthly expenses.

658
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:36,956
Solicitor sir, did brother-in-law
make this will when...

659
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,959
...he was in his proper senses.

660
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:40,984
I have written this will myself.

661
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:44,955
OK, now you can go.
- I will leave

662
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:51,065
Poor sister, our brother-in-law
has given a shock even while dying.

663
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:53,897
<i>God knows what magic that
Ska and that wicked nephew...</i>

664
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:57,410
...did on him. - If you want to
get the whole property again...

665
00:58:57,467 --> 00:59:01,415
...you have to throw both of
them like fleas in milk.

666
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,278
But how?

667
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,980
Leave that to me.

668
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:11,123
Such a big mishap has happened
in this house...

669
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,059
...nobody even informed me.
- Grandpa...

670
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:19,331
Everything happened so
suddenly, grandpa

671
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:26,864
My husband died and you opened
your doors for these thieves

672
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,037
Already she has stolen the
necklace and given it to this...

673
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:32,943
...old man. - Yes - Now will you
hand over the property too.

674
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,409
Shobha, what is this
insolence?

675
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:41,319
Great, great shot! Now this cat
has started hissing.

676
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:45,287
Keep quiet and talk with respect.
You are lazy and don't do work.

677
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:53,266
What? - Now she will even
say all this, you've to bear it.

678
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:57,803
As our late brother-in-law has
written all this property in her..

679
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,899
...name, no bad behavior with her
will be tolerated.

680
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:03,774
What are you people speaking?

681
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,838
Rakesh, kick and throw this old
man out of the house.

682
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:12,319
We will do it now, sister.

683
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:12,909
Move away, new master...

684
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:15,115
Son Amar, these people..

685
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:22,053
Wicked fellow, you got so
much courage that you...

686
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:26,328
...hit Grandpa.- Leave him...
Amar, on my oath, leave him.

687
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,726
Don't take your oath, Bhabhi.
Uncle just expired and this..

688
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,236
...wicked fellow has started
showing his evil colours.

689
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,273
Who are you to interfere
in this house?

690
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:34,001
I mean still a lot to this house.

691
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:37,510
As the eldest in this house, it is
your duty to take care of...

692
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:40,044
...this family but you are bent on
splitting this family.

693
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:43,044
Shobha, you have already put
your in-law's house on fire.

694
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:45,347
Now do you want to ruin
this house too.

695
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:46,512
Listen to this carefully,
wicked fellow.

696
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:50,281
I am still alive. If you even
raise a finger against this...

697
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:51,848
...house, I will cut your hand.

698
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:56,554
Come, Grandpa. I will leave
you till your house.

699
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:04,771
Brother, what is the cost of this
halwa? - 40 Rs. a kg

700
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:07,834
Too costly, how much does this
cost?- Ten Rs. a kg but...

701
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:11,174
...something fell on this and is
not fit for eating by humans.

702
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:12,406
Good, give it to me
- OK - Take this

703
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:20,013
Hail the Goddess!
Hail Goddess, dear sister.

704
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:22,352
Good moments have come

705
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:26,188
What is it? - In one shot, I
have arranged for your son..

706
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:28,820
...to progress in the lines of
Tata and Birla.

707
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,992
You take this God's offering
and eat it, sister

708
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,165
What are you doing, sister?
If you spit, God's offering...

709
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:36,430
...God will spit on your face.
You eat it.

710
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:37,493
You should not see the taste in
God's offering. Eat it

711
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:41,436
But, what is the matter?

712
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:45,477
I have done the Bhoomipujan
(starting worship) for...

713
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:45,740
a big factory for Prakash.

714
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:50,911
You have thought to do
a great thing.

715
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:53,544
After brother-in-law, who is
there, who will think about...

716
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,551
...the welfare of this house.

717
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:58,885
Sister, I have done the worship
for a big factory but for...

718
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:00,154
...starting the factory, some
money is...

719
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:06,189
How many money do you want?
- Only 5 lakhs. - 5 lakhs...

720
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:11,068
I will just get it. Sita,
get the cheque book from...

721
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,835
...the office and give the
cheque to him.

722
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:15,471
Why give that difficulty
to her?

723
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:18,944
I got the cheque book from
office while coming and...

724
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:20,002
...have also filled five
lakhs in that.

725
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,049
<i>You lust get the signature
of Ska 'm this.</i>

726
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:25,314
But he never mentioned
anything about the factory

727
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:31,024
I can't give you even one penny
without consulting him.

728
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:35,123
How dare you talk back to me
and refuse my orders?

729
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:37,289
I can do anything for my
husband's welfare.

730
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:40,459
But let me get convinced first
that the money is being...

731
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:43,868
...used correctly.
- Stop this nonsense.

732
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,763
No, dear sister. Learn
to speak in the...

733
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,866
...right manner with the new
mistress of this house...

734
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,071
...or she will make
you beg for every penny.

735
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:53,739
Otherwise else, she has no
respect for you. You are no..

736
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:58,843
...mistress. You are wicked,
a beggar & useless...She says so

737
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:02,983
Mother, there is still time.
You try to understand.

738
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:06,726
This man is a snake.
- She has started thinking..

739
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,923
...that she is some mistress. Why
not, inside the house...

740
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:14,765
...her loving brother-in-law is
always running behind her.

741
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:19,297
There is no one to ask her
and the ground is clear.

742
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:21,840
Two young players in love and
the play is on.

743
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:24,372
Anyway, everything is fair
in love.

744
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:28,946
What happened?

745
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:33,817
Your Sita is slightly crossing
the limit line.

746
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,048
How dare she?
I will just see to her.

747
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:40,056
Wait, nephew...
You will see everything slowly

748
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:49,136
These are not sleeping pills
but bullets.

749
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:52,836
Now see, how they
sleep...

750
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,741
Carefully..

751
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:11,987
Shobha, you... -Amar, I have
realized my mistakes.

752
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:14,826
I will go to my husband's house.

753
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:17,355
Whenever your eye opens,
morning starts there.

754
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:20,866
Drink this milk- You keep it,
I will drink afterwards.

755
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:26,765
Won't you listen to your sister?
It is very late at night.

756
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:31,208
Drink this quietly and sleep.
- OK, I will drink it.

757
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,478
I had it... OK!
- Good night.

758
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:20,347
How did I come here?

759
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:25,222
Is it? Now, you will ask,
whose room is that.

760
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:29,252
Then you will ask me, what you
were doing throughout the..

761
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:32,231
...night in this room.

762
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:35,132
Amar, what happened?

763
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:41,333
Listen to this now.
The way she is talking...

764
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,775
Talk straight..
what do you want to say?

765
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:47,440
You told me that even Ravan
never raised hands on Sita.

766
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:51,041
But, you were putting your hands
throughout the night.

767
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:54,854
Amar...- Prakash, you don't
come in between. - You be quiet.

768
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:59,256
All this is a lie. I beg to you,
don't say anything to Amar.

769
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:02,729
Now you won't stay in this
house. Get out of here.

770
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:05,225
No.. - You are not
fit for this house.

771
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:11,230
Prakash, don't do this. There is
some conspiracy in this.

772
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:14,868
Amar, first you are sitting like a
snake on my property.

773
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,303
After that you have blemished
my respect and now...

774
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:21,439
...you have come to support
this characterless woman.

775
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,477
I will deal with you later.

776
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:28,353
Let me throw this virtue less
woman out of the house first.

777
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:32,985
If this is it, not Bhabhi but I
will go out of this house.

778
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:37,195
But remember one thing, the
relationship between Bhabhi...

779
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:40,723
...and brother-in-law is sacred
like that of a son and mother

780
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:45,436
And God never forgives those
who blemish this relationship.

781
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:52,504
Stop, Amar.

782
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:58,176
The whole world has become
my enemy.

783
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:03,647
Only you are my support. You
are also leaving me and going.

784
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:11,761
I can't remain in this house
like a blemish on you.

785
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:15,133
Please forgive me.

786
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:18,328
Forgive me, Bhabhi

787
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:57,335
My house is like
Ayodhya

788
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:03,445
Every day here is very
pleasant.

789
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:09,920
This dream should not break.
This is my only prayer.

790
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:21,929
Please show mercy on me as I
trust only you.

791
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:34,873
Sita... - Mother... You are
like my own mother.

792
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:41,015
If you also think wrong about me
who'll listen to me in this house.

793
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:44,114
Who will take care of me?

794
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,991
You are right, daughter.
Forget those things.

795
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:51,262
Your father-in-law was
like your father. Isn't it?

796
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:57,361
Then we will pray for appeasing
his soul in the Kuldevi temple..

797
01:09:57,426 --> 01:10:01,272
...today evening. Then everything
will become all right.

798
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:24,256
Mother, where is kuldevi's
temple?

799
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:27,062
Temple.. -I will tell you.

800
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:38,834
Come, let us show the
God to you.

801
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:48,548
Leave me. I am telling you...
leave me.

802
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:59,431
No... NO...
Don't do like th is.

803
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,904
Save me...

804
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:18,413
Why, sister, have we not given
shocks of fire to this problem?

805
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:21,980
Save me...

806
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:38,171
Bhabhi..
- Save me, Amar.

807
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:41,303
Don't fear.
I have come.

808
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:52,381
I knew that these wicked fellows
will do something very bad.

809
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:55,153
That is why I was following like
a shadow even after leaving...

810
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:59,556
...the house.
Come..

811
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:16,874
Have you seen the
effect of goodness?

812
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:21,237
You have seen your own pyre
burning in front of your eyes.

813
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:25,280
That Sita's sacred nature is
burning in this fire.

814
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:28,444
There is time even now.
Wake up and...

815
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,990
...turn these tears of yours
into fire.

816
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:35,420
If we forgive and leave these
people, some Sita or Savitri...

817
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:39,398
...will always be burning
somewhere in this country.

818
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:41,963
We have to teach a lesson
to these people or..

819
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:46,439
...this women's society will
never forgive you.

820
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:52,176
You are right, Amar.
You are right.

821
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:57,011
Till today, I bore all the
atrocities very quietly.

822
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:05,482
But I will now become Durga
from Sita.

823
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:10,959
I will take revenge on everyone
one by one for everything.

824
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:16,093
I will not leave anyone.
No one!

825
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,342
Yes, it is about to start
any moment.

826
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:31,782
Brother, it is eight now. Why
don't you start the auction?

827
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,954
I'm sorry, madam. Till the
famous millionaire Kaminidevi...

828
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:39,049
...of Calcutta does not come, we
can't start the auction.

829
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:43,995
Millionaire or billionaire, time
does not wait for anyone.

830
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:47,333
Yes, we can't wait.
- Please be quiet.

831
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:53,896
I wish you all a very happy
Christmas and New Year.

832
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:55,537
I will start the auction.

833
01:13:56,331 --> 01:14:00,336
Ladies and gentlmen, this is the
sparkling diamond necklace...

834
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:04,810
All of you start bidding
Come on, say it...

835
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:08,252
You, Nakadramji,
please come.

836
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:14,191
How did you dare to start the
auction before the arrival...

837
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:17,355
...our madam, Kaminidevi,
you fool.

838
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,191
The matter is...
- What is it?

839
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,930
Matter is..
- Shut up - OK

840
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:29,199
Our madam does not move with
time but time moves with her.

841
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:35,215
Yes... - Turn your face, and see
our madam is coming there.

842
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:49,361
How beautiful she is!
She is also rich.

843
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:54,056
Come...- What is the matter,
Nakadramji

844
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:59,470
They dared to start the auction
before your arrival, madam.

845
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:04,877
Oh! Ask them the value of
all these jewellery.

846
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,444
Say it - The value of all these
jewellery is just 25 lakhs.

847
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:12,986
We will give 30 lakhs.
- Say ahead- Mine is 35 lakhs

848
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:15,278
Forty...- forty-five...
- Fifty lakhs.

849
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:17,052
Fifty lakhs...

850
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:22,323
Fifty lakhs and one...

851
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:28,697
Daughter, how much money
will she have?

852
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:39,304
Nakadramji, pay in cash and
send all this jewellery...

853
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,746
...to Calcutta house.- OK, that
will be done

854
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:44,115
Come, sir

855
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:53,452
Excuse me, Kamini devi, I am
- Hey, Mr. Butterfly...

856
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:57,827
...our madam does not talk with
anyone without appointment.

857
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,966
Did you understand? Go...
Let us go, madam

858
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:09,265
This Kaminidevi's face resembles
Sita, isn't it?

859
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:13,278
Sister, why are you raking up
burnt pyres?

860
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:17,211
Mummy, where is that witch and
where is this princess?

861
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:24,053
Hey Mister, is she a lightning or
terror? Can you tell something?

862
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:27,116
Sir, she is the only daughter of
billionaire Karodimal and...

863
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:29,924
...is a spinster and comes
for business tours

864
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:32,431
People wait to sell buy their
company's shares from her.

865
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:36,491
I have seen the union of beauty
and wealth for the first time.

866
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:39,471
Hey, youth...
come here.

867
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:45,004
Forget her beauty and
think about her wealth.

868
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:50,475
If she can be caught, we will be
billionaires. Have you understood

869
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:55,985
Brother, Prakash & Rakesh are
restless to get caught in our net.

870
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:59,459
You also keep an eye on them
- You don't worry.

871
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,425
I am always with you
at every step

872
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,923
See, so many big businessmen
are here

873
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:13,423
Till your appointment with our
madam is not fixed.. -Sir..

874
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:23,807
Be quiet.. not you. Till your
appointment is fixed with our...

875
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:26,284
...madam, I can't sell our
company's shares to you.

876
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:34,817
Shut up! Not to you.. Nakadram
is not used to hear nonsense.

877
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:39,421
Who are you and why
are you standing here?

878
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:42,162
We want to invest something
in business and..

879
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:47,333
...we want to meet Kaminidevi?
- You want to meet her.

880
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:53,345
Wow, great people. Are all the
big businessmen in this city...

881
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:57,248
...are here to play? They
also want to meet our madam.

882
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:01,010
But our madam does not meet
anyone without appointment.

883
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:06,285
Please.. you- Remove your hands.
- You please think of something

884
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:11,425
OK, you think about me and I
will think about you.

885
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:15,724
I didn't understand -Brother, I'm
a public phone.

886
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:20,069
Put a coin and then talk.
- I have understood Nakadramji

887
01:18:20,128 --> 01:18:21,334
Give it.

888
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,378
Now tell me how much money
you want to invest.

889
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:29,414
One and half lakhs.

890
01:18:32,107 --> 01:18:38,080
Don't joke, fools. Our madam's
dogs eat biscuits for this...

891
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:41,184
...amount in a month.
- Dogs... - Yes, you... dogs.

892
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:47,299
Mr. Gajjar.. you bloody fool.
What do you think of yourself

893
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:50,825
Many cheap persons like you
are in my pockets

894
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,735
I said get out
- But madam...

895
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:10,455
Oh, God!I came to buy shares
for 2 lakhs and they...

896
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:12,158
...are telling me to open
a Bhelpuri shop.

897
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:19,356
Did you see how madam got rid
of a businessman with 2 lakhs?

898
01:19:20,789 --> 01:19:24,464
If you want to do business with
madam, increase this amount.

899
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:30,260
But..- Why you stand for so long
here. Go home and increase...

900
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:38,276
...the amounts.
Go..

901
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:47,018
OK...
- What did you say?

902
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:07,244
OK, now I will go.

903
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:11,907
OK.. - OK..
- I will go now.

904
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:16,379
Where?
- To my house.

905
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:20,023
Don't do this atrocity.

906
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:27,026
Tomorrow or day after
tomorrow, we will meet again

907
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:19,479
You danced here and there was a
sweet rain of songs here.

908
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:39,833
Both of us got drenched in
that and this is an unique event.

909
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:45,074
This is due to the kohl
in your eyes...

910
01:21:45,133 --> 01:21:49,377
...that the days sank and
night started.

911
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:54,011
Yes, it is night now.
See, it is night

912
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:57,545
You keep listening to this
love story.

913
01:21:57,779 --> 01:21:59,952
This matter has become
old now.

914
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:03,155
The night is very cyclonic,
see it.

915
01:22:03,218 --> 01:22:05,027
I don't fear, my love.

916
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:11,499
It is night now and
the stars are sparkling...

917
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:14,229
...and we will embrace

918
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:21,311
Arey.. somebody will see us.
- Let them, you please wait.

919
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:26,480
Tomorrow or day-after, I
will meet you again.

920
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:08,761
The sweat drops on
your face are like...

921
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:14,267
...the showers of rain
in this hot sun.

922
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:33,341
My wet hair is like the strings
of the muslin cloth

923
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:37,379
This is the crime of
your youth that...

924
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:43,157
...handcuffs have been
put in your hands

925
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:45,858
Yes, see the handcuffs.

926
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:54,138
This lover is very straight
- Don't trouble me too much.

927
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:56,740
Come to me and
make your promise.

928
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:59,210
The only problem is
the people of this world.

929
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:02,373
What can the people in
this world do?

930
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:07,418
They will be very jealous
when they see us.

931
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:11,721
Let me go... Please,
I am scared.

932
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:17,955
Tomorrow and day after that,
we will meet again.

933
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:50,324
Please accept. -Yes, lawyer sir...
please keep it.

934
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:55,265
Listen, you can't bribe me and
transfer the property in...

935
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:58,236
...Sitadevi's name to Prakash's
name. I am sorry.

936
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,807
Now where will so much money
come from.

937
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:03,706
How will we please
Kaminidevi?

938
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:07,804
Now we will lose here and that
Rakesh has not come yet.

939
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:11,117
You are all hungry, naked and
frauds.

940
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:14,913
I am not saying this but
Seth Talichand.

941
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:18,756
Our reputation in the market is
so bad that people...

942
01:25:18,813 --> 01:25:20,417
...are giving us shocks after
shocks.

943
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:22,291
Nobody is ready to give even a
penny as loan to us.

944
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:24,125
What do we do now?

945
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:28,196
Sister, you remove your bangles
and take out all your...

946
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:31,999
...jewellery from the locker
- No..

947
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:34,301
I have already sold jewels for
one and half lakhs for you.

948
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:38,105
That amount has come back
to us with a bang.

949
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:40,908
Kaminidevi's dogs eat biscuits for
so much amount every month

950
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:44,439
I will see these jewels of yours
and raise 5 lakhs.

951
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:48,886
Mummy, give these jewels. My
life will be made with this.

952
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:54,894
Madam, this is Mr. Rakesh
- Sit...

953
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:59,329
And this is Mr. Prakash who is
a owner of a small mill

954
01:25:59,387 --> 01:26:02,391
Come, do you want to sell the
mill.

955
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:04,835
We want to invest some money
in a business with you.

956
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:09,672
Oh! How much amount do
you have with you?-5 lakhs

957
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:16,774
Only that much... You said that
they were mill owners

958
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:20,149
Yes, but... - You are right, but
the mill is in the name of...

959
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:23,314
...his late wife.
- His late wife...

960
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:28,418
So sad, you are so handsome
and young.

961
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:32,056
Such a tragedy has occurred in
your life in such a small age

962
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:36,432
Don't remind me about that or
I can't stop my tears.

963
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:40,166
It looks like, you used to
love her a lot.

964
01:26:40,228 --> 01:26:48,773
Only love, how do we tell what
sort of a girl she was?

965
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:50,338
What a girl she was?

966
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:55,320
We used to protect her
like a delicate flower.

967
01:26:55,376 --> 01:27:01,759
The day her pyre was burnt,
our heart broke.

968
01:27:01,816 --> 01:27:09,098
Madam, our tears have
not stopped from that day.

969
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:12,138
Hold your tears, brother. You
will need them afterwards

970
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:18,803
So sad, Mr. Prakash -Nakadram,
these people are good at heart

971
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:20,868
Think a little about them.

972
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:24,314
Not little, I will think so much
about them that, these people...

973
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:28,252
...will also keep thinking as to
what I thought for them.

974
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:32,314
What are you guys thinking now?
Our madam has become an...

975
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:36,294
...emotional fool by listening to
your story. I mean emotional...

976
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:43,758
Give your money, let me put it in
the well, I mean the oil wells...

977
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:48,205
...owned by the Madam in Assam.
Have you understood? - Yes

978
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:51,506
If you have understood, why
have you not gone till now.

979
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:56,079
Why are you two standing
here for so long?

980
01:27:56,137 --> 01:27:57,480
Go home. When the work is
over, you should go home.

981
01:28:02,143 --> 01:28:04,919
Great, uncle. We really moved
the hearts of Kamini & Nakadram.

982
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:09,359
Child, to impress a rich woman,
I can become her dog...

983
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:09,485
...and wag my tail.

984
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:12,962
You played with me too. You
promised me and now...

985
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:14,796
...your intentions have
changed

986
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:18,235
Hey, the new shock of old youth,
go away from here.

987
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:24,272
And listen...if you try to cross
my way again, I will give...

988
01:28:24,332 --> 01:28:26,209
...you such a shock that you will
remember throughout your life

989
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:50,395
Give me a kiss before
you go.

990
01:29:05,707 --> 01:29:06,276
Save me...

991
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:09,652
Save me...

992
01:30:57,752 --> 01:31:01,723
Darling, that same lovers..
- Don't play the horns...

993
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:03,268
...play this
Bompu

994
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:06,237
What is the use? They are
looking in each other's eyes

995
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:09,241
Nobody has dared to stop
Rustam's way till today.

996
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:13,074
Is this a road or a battle ground?
If I slap you once, all your...

997
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:15,910
...teeth will come out
- I did a mistake, Baba

998
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:17,978
First you do mistake and now
you also talk. Say sorry.

999
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:20,451
What will you do if I don't
say sorry. - What'll I do?

1000
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:24,820
Can't you see that my five
lions are with me.

1001
01:31:24,879 --> 01:31:27,325
Our whole society calls them
as the five pandavas

1002
01:31:27,381 --> 01:31:29,088
I am the father of five
pandavas.

1003
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:30,959
Have you understood what
I am?

1004
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:34,864
He was a coward who ran
away but you are facing Rustam

1005
01:31:34,922 --> 01:31:37,732
You dare to do rowdism on the
road & also romance with a girl.

1006
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:40,466
All the rogues in all the markets
get scared...

1007
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:43,236
...on hearing my name.

1008
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:52,809
See my Dilnavas. All the rogues
in the city were after her...

1009
01:31:52,874 --> 01:31:55,013
I beat each and everyone of
them and made them run..

1010
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:56,749
Will you keep_quiet or
go on talking?

1011
01:31:56,811 --> 01:32:00,452
Why do you want to get beaten
by such a strong man?

1012
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:03,161
Please forgive his mistake,
Babaji

1013
01:32:03,217 --> 01:32:06,755
Forgive him... Such rogues should
never be forgiven.

1014
01:32:06,821 --> 01:32:10,963
Since you told me, I am under a
compulsion & I have forgiven him

1015
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:14,495
Will you come to listen to me...
- He is behind her...

1016
01:32:14,729 --> 01:32:19,235
You are the father of 5 sons,
still you can't stop going...

1017
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:22,941
...after a girl. Aren't you
ashamed? Come now..

1018
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:26,417
I am going or I would have
broken all his bones and put...

1019
01:32:26,474 --> 01:32:30,354
...in Municipality garbage box.
Did you understand?

1020
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:34,086
Now go as I have forgiven
you.

1021
01:32:36,784 --> 01:32:39,094
What strange children!
They laugh sometimes and...

1022
01:32:39,153 --> 01:32:43,192
...clap sometimes. Come on,
Get inside

1023
01:32:48,995 --> 01:32:51,532
What a beautiful place?

1024
01:32:54,501 --> 01:32:58,005
Wah, Kaminidevi? We are
fortunate to have seen you.

1025
01:32:58,672 --> 01:33:02,882
Your private chamber is so
beautiful. Isn't it, daughter?

1026
01:33:03,443 --> 01:33:07,619
You have increased the glory of
our city by coming here

1027
01:33:07,681 --> 01:33:11,823
Isn't it, daughter?
- Yes, it is true.

1028
01:33:11,885 --> 01:33:15,856
You have met me. I am Shobha,
sister of Prakash.

1029
01:33:18,592 --> 01:33:19,593
She is my mother,
Shantidevi.

1030
01:33:19,659 --> 01:33:24,540
We've heard a lot of you. It
seems you spread peace...

1031
01:33:24,598 --> 01:33:29,206
...wherever you go. Your son
Prakash was saying that.

1032
01:33:31,104 --> 01:33:34,483
Please sit, I mean this sofa has
been made for people to sit.

1033
01:33:36,643 --> 01:33:37,485
Sit down

1034
01:33:41,681 --> 01:33:44,958
Kaminidevi, I am the president
of ladies club here.

1035
01:33:45,018 --> 01:33:48,761
We have organized a
meeting of ladies club for you

1036
01:33:48,822 --> 01:33:52,463
I wish that you come there
and make us fortunate...

1037
01:33:52,525 --> 01:33:56,166
...and give a nice lecture

1038
01:33:57,931 --> 01:34:00,070
No, madam has no time for
such useless meetings.

1039
01:34:00,133 --> 01:34:01,976
Please, Kaminidevi

1040
01:34:02,035 --> 01:34:09,010
What is that please? it is not
easy to book Madam's time.

1041
01:34:09,075 --> 01:34:13,785
Nakadramji, cancel all the
appointments. Ladies first!

1042
01:34:13,847 --> 01:34:15,690
Did you understand?

1043
01:34:15,749 --> 01:34:18,958
On what topic, do I have
to give a lecture there.

1044
01:34:20,887 --> 01:34:22,594
Respect of the daughter-in-law
in her husband's place

1045
01:34:22,656 --> 01:34:28,902
Our madam has absolutely
no experience in the above topic

1046
01:34:28,962 --> 01:34:34,810
If you have any experience, why
don't you tell here.

1047
01:34:34,868 --> 01:34:40,750
Me...- Whgt will this poor
glrl say?

1048
01:34:40,807 --> 01:34:43,151
She has only left her husband's
house & is presently living with me.

1049
01:34:43,209 --> 01:34:48,750
Did you have any fight with your
husband? - What sort of fight?

1050
01:34:48,815 --> 01:34:50,624
The one that always happens.

1051
01:34:50,684 --> 01:34:54,598
Nakadramji, these are
respectable women of society.

1052
01:34:54,654 --> 01:34:57,100
Behave with respect with them.
- Sorry

1053
01:34:57,157 --> 01:35:00,001
You both go, I will surely come
to the meeting.

1054
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:04,475
Thank you -I am grateful - I
know that you are a great fool

1055
01:35:16,109 --> 01:35:19,682
What a time has come? Uncle,
nephew and mother-daughter...

1056
01:35:19,746 --> 01:35:23,023
...all four of them are running
behind you together.

1057
01:35:23,083 --> 01:35:28,123
They are not running but
revolving around you

1058
01:35:36,696 --> 01:35:41,475
I request her to give a
lecture full of valuable advice

1059
01:35:47,807 --> 01:35:51,118
The world says that the women
in our country have made...

1060
01:35:51,177 --> 01:35:55,819
...great progress. But today also,
girls are weighed as per the...

1061
01:35:55,882 --> 01:35:57,884
...dowry they bring in our
society.

1062
01:35:57,951 --> 01:36:04,027
Even if a poor girl is very
beautiful and virtuous...

1063
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:10,530
...she has no right to become the
daughter-in-law of a...

1064
01:36:10,597 --> 01:36:12,838
...rich family without dowry.
- Is she taunting us?

1065
01:36:13,099 --> 01:36:16,103
But women like Shantidevi are
great who accepted a poor...

1066
01:36:16,169 --> 01:36:19,742
...school master's grand daughter
as her daughter-in-law...

1067
01:36:19,806 --> 01:36:23,583
...and gave an example to this
society.-She is praising us

1068
01:36:23,643 --> 01:36:27,648
If rich life is not written in
poor women's fate...

1069
01:36:27,714 --> 01:36:31,093
...what can the poor
mother-in-law do for that?

1070
01:36:31,151 --> 01:36:36,760
I have heard that Shantidevi
loved her daughter-in-law a lot

1071
01:36:39,259 --> 01:36:43,833
But the brides here have a great
wish to burn themselves & die.

1072
01:36:43,897 --> 01:36:47,640
They should just get a chance
and they jump into fire.

1073
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:52,979
I am not saying that you killed
your daughter-in-law by...

1074
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:56,509
...burning her alive or she burnt
in the fire herself.

1075
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:58,988
But what will poor Shantidevi
do?

1076
01:36:59,045 --> 01:37:04,757
People say a lot but who can
stop the world from talking.

1077
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:09,901
My dear women, such women are
a blemish to womenhood...

1078
01:37:09,956 --> 01:37:15,133
...whether she is the
sister-in-law or mother-in-law

1079
01:37:15,195 --> 01:37:19,735
My message to you is that we
should stop such mishaps and...

1080
01:37:19,799 --> 01:37:24,805
...blacken the face of women who
do such atrocity and hit...

1081
01:37:24,871 --> 01:37:28,045
...them with shoes and drive
them out of this country.

1082
01:37:34,948 --> 01:37:36,484
This is called the
shock of money

1083
01:37:36,549 --> 01:37:40,554
Have you never seen any money
before? It is full 10 lakhs

1084
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:45,467
You stood up in shock. Five
lakhs are yours & 5 lakhs profit

1085
01:37:45,525 --> 01:37:50,736
Thank you - What are you
laughing, it is all yours.

1086
01:37:50,797 --> 01:37:58,443
Didn't I tell you that your
horoscope matches with madam

1087
01:37:58,504 --> 01:38:02,475
You invested 5 lakhs in oil wells
and we made 5 lakhs profit...

1088
01:38:02,542 --> 01:38:06,820
...You share it.
- Thank you

1089
01:38:16,689 --> 01:38:17,963
Thank you very much,
Nakadramji

1090
01:38:18,024 --> 01:38:26,000
Don't just thank, think about
me too. - Take this

1091
01:38:27,967 --> 01:38:30,607
This much is not enough.
This is too less.

1092
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:35,210
I will just take 4 times of
that. You go now.

1093
01:38:38,478 --> 01:38:45,896
We will go - Listen now,
before madam's mood gets...

1094
01:38:45,952 --> 01:38:49,126
...spoiled, if you want to get
some work done that is...

1095
01:38:49,188 --> 01:38:53,034
...any other work, please call
this NakadRam.

1096
01:39:01,901 --> 01:39:06,509
Why are you two still standing
here? Go now.

1097
01:39:09,509 --> 01:39:13,116
What is this play of yours?
I did not understand.

1098
01:39:14,047 --> 01:39:15,822
Why have you given five lakhs
from the house to them?

1099
01:39:18,851 --> 01:39:23,027
Those fools gave 5 lakhs for
attracting us that day.

1100
01:39:26,759 --> 01:39:29,968
Using their formula, I gave them
the false profit of 5 lakhs...

1101
01:39:30,029 --> 01:39:33,704
...and have caught them
in our net.

1102
01:39:33,766 --> 01:39:38,215
What if they don't invest again?
- How they will not invest?

1103
01:39:38,438 --> 01:39:44,946
That is not money but a magnet
which will push them to us.

1104
01:39:49,916 --> 01:39:52,021
I will give a grand party to my
friends in the hotel and I...

1105
01:39:52,085 --> 01:39:57,057
...will buy a beautiful Mercedes.
- Shut up, let your car go to hell

1106
01:39:57,123 --> 01:40:01,731
First, I will recover my jewels,
buy new jewellery and also...

1107
01:40:01,794 --> 01:40:05,742
...some sarees - You are
all fools

1108
01:40:05,798 --> 01:40:10,679
You saw some money and
started wagging your tongues

1109
01:40:10,737 --> 01:40:15,117
What to do? From the time, that
Sita burnt in fire, all the...

1110
01:40:15,174 --> 01:40:18,883
...property has been sealed.
We have been able to see...

1111
01:40:18,945 --> 01:40:20,686
...so much money after
many days.

1112
01:40:20,747 --> 01:40:25,025
This money is just a small
quantity of golden eggs from...

1113
01:40:25,084 --> 01:40:26,961
...the chicken which lays
golden eggs.

1114
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:30,524
You think about the one who
gave you this profit.

1115
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:34,538
Take this amount and buy a
small gift for Kamini..

1116
01:40:34,594 --> 01:40:38,974
...and enter her heart slowly.

1117
01:40:39,032 --> 01:40:45,142
Then see, how happiness
returns to this house.-Yes

1118
01:40:45,204 --> 01:40:50,085
Is that so? See how I attract
her now.

1119
01:40:55,782 --> 01:40:57,090
He has come..
Go now

1120
01:40:57,150 --> 01:41:03,863
Ramu, is there someone.
Someone bring my shoes.

1121
01:41:11,998 --> 01:41:14,171
No, not you...
- It is all right.

1122
01:41:23,409 --> 01:41:24,410
Kaminiji, show me
your legs.

1123
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:30,993
No, what is this you are doing?
Where've the servants gone?

1124
01:41:31,451 --> 01:41:33,453
What is there? You consider me
also as your servant.

1125
01:41:35,221 --> 01:41:39,135
A small gift for you.
- Oh, it is beautiful.

1126
01:41:39,859 --> 01:41:42,999
Not more beautiful than you.
- Is it so?

1127
01:41:43,062 --> 01:41:45,804
It is great. If someone gets a
life companion like you,..

1128
01:41:45,865 --> 01:41:49,472
...her life will be heaven.
These are very beautiful.

1129
01:41:49,535 --> 01:41:52,948
Nagadram, if you give
permission, I want to invite...

1130
01:41:53,005 --> 01:41:58,421
...Kaminidevi for dinner.
- Sorry, I can't come.

1131
01:41:58,744 --> 01:42:01,020
Please.. Kaminiji- Madam,
fulfill his heart's wish.

1132
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,720
If his heart breaks, then it
cannot be mended again.

1133
01:42:03,783 --> 01:42:07,754
But all my appointments...
- Madam, this is the most...

1134
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:09,629
...important appointment
of your life.

1135
01:42:09,689 --> 01:42:13,159
Mr. Prakash, you make
arrangements for food.

1136
01:42:13,659 --> 01:42:15,536
Madam is coming to your
house for dinner.

1137
01:42:16,028 --> 01:42:19,134
Thank you, Kaminiji- OK.
- You are too good

1138
01:42:21,801 --> 01:42:24,577
You are also good. I am a very
big fan of yours.

1139
01:42:27,106 --> 01:42:30,713
Why are you standing for so
long? Go fast now

1140
01:42:30,776 --> 01:42:36,454
What is it, Bhabhi? -By making
him lift my shoes...

1141
01:42:36,516 --> 01:42:38,189
...you have not done a good
thing.

1142
01:42:38,417 --> 01:42:44,527
Great, Bhabhi. Did you do a good
thing by putting his shoes for him?

1143
01:42:45,992 --> 01:42:49,132
I know that your feelings
have been hurt.

1144
01:42:49,595 --> 01:42:53,509
But I had to find out whether he
will lift your shoes or not.

1145
01:42:55,234 --> 01:42:58,511
If a man starts lifting the shoes
of a woman, then you...

1146
01:42:58,571 --> 01:43:01,609
...understand that he can sacrifice
everything for her.

1147
01:43:03,442 --> 01:43:06,753
Today I trust that my arrow
has hit its correct mark

1148
01:43:06,812 --> 01:43:13,696
Just see how I bring all of them
at your feet, Bhabhi.

1149
01:43:13,753 --> 01:43:16,666
Welcome..
Welcome..

1150
01:43:17,523 --> 01:43:22,836
Everyone saw her coming and the
light of the lamps...

1151
01:43:22,895 --> 01:43:25,501
...became brighter as soon
as she entered.

1152
01:43:25,565 --> 01:43:27,909
Please come, Kaminidevi.

1153
01:43:27,967 --> 01:43:32,882
Our house has become sacred
when you have stepped in.

1154
01:43:32,939 --> 01:43:36,182
Prakash never tires of
singing your praise.

1155
01:43:39,011 --> 01:43:42,584
There is no air-conditioner,
it is very hot.- I am sorry

1156
01:43:42,648 --> 01:43:45,891
lam tired... You please sit
Sit..

1157
01:43:46,452 --> 01:43:47,430
You will become tired by
standing.

1158
01:43:47,486 --> 01:43:49,989
You move, let me fan her.

1159
01:43:50,056 --> 01:43:51,865
Did the AC have to get repaired
only today?

1160
01:43:51,924 --> 01:43:53,904
Are your legs paining?
Let me press it.

1161
01:43:54,627 --> 01:43:55,935
Somebody please bring water

1162
01:43:56,529 --> 01:43:59,100
You go and bring water. Bring
milk.. Bring fast...

1163
01:44:01,167 --> 01:44:02,043
Don't upset Kaminidevi.

1164
01:44:43,175 --> 01:44:46,019
Listen, my relative
and my brother.

1165
01:44:46,078 --> 01:44:53,121
How the money is making
you dance?

1166
01:44:57,490 --> 01:45:01,836
Did I say the truth
or a lie?

1167
01:45:05,898 --> 01:45:11,576
You said the truth only

1168
01:46:00,820 --> 01:46:06,168
If a poor girl comes to the
house, the mother-in-law...

1169
01:46:06,225 --> 01:46:11,072
...tortures her. But if she brings
wealth with her...

1170
01:46:11,130 --> 01:46:14,509
...the mother-in-law will keep
her on her head.

1171
01:46:20,206 --> 01:46:22,982
A woman is a puppet like this
and

1172
01:46:23,042 --> 01:46:26,888
...gold is sold in the rate of
mud.

1173
01:46:26,946 --> 01:46:30,621
Gold is sold in the rate of
mud.

1174
01:46:32,885 --> 01:46:37,027
See one place, my friends...

1175
01:46:38,891 --> 01:46:41,701
How is this sun and the
shadow?

1176
01:46:43,529 --> 01:46:45,031
How much can the money
make you dance?

1177
01:46:51,036 --> 01:46:57,510
Did I tell the truth
or a lie?

1178
01:46:57,843 --> 01:47:04,988
You said the truth.

1179
01:47:16,929 --> 01:47:18,875
Every day there is a fight
for dowry...

1180
01:47:18,931 --> 01:47:23,004
and the women's clothes
are burnt.

1181
01:47:24,069 --> 01:47:27,573
If you report, the police do
not bother...

1182
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:30,621
...then who will catch the
criminal?

1183
01:47:36,449 --> 01:47:42,593
Then this crazy man says that
today the world has changed.

1184
01:47:42,655 --> 01:47:46,193
That world is not existing
today.

1185
01:47:48,027 --> 01:47:54,034
A woman sits on one side
of the balance and...

1186
01:47:54,099 --> 01:47:56,875
...in the other side the
money is put.

1187
01:47:59,038 --> 01:48:00,949
The money makes you dance.

1188
01:48:05,911 --> 01:48:12,658
Did I tell the truth
or a lie?

1189
01:48:13,586 --> 01:48:18,797
You said only the truth

1190
01:49:06,472 --> 01:49:10,443
You go away now. Don't know
from where he has come...

1191
01:49:10,509 --> 01:49:11,214
...to give me shocks of
problems.

1192
01:49:11,443 --> 01:49:15,084
I will give you two slaps
with a force.

1193
01:49:15,147 --> 01:49:18,458
This is my uncle's house
and not your father's.

1194
01:49:18,517 --> 01:49:23,432
I got news that my future Bhabhi
has come here and hence I came..

1195
01:49:23,489 --> 01:49:26,436
...to meet her. Hi, Bhabhi
- Hi...

1196
01:49:26,492 --> 01:49:29,234
Please be beware of them.
These people have lots of...

1197
01:49:29,461 --> 01:49:33,876
...love...
for this money.

1198
01:49:37,002 --> 01:49:38,982
You go from here now.
- OK, leave me till the gate.

1199
01:49:39,038 --> 01:49:41,985
Come... - I will just come.

1200
01:49:42,041 --> 01:49:45,454
Very interesting person... I feel
like coming here often now.

1201
01:49:48,948 --> 01:49:52,054
Please Kamini...
Let us go.

1202
01:49:59,959 --> 01:50:02,439
I don't know from where he
came to trouble us.

1203
01:50:02,494 --> 01:50:07,842
Thank God that Kamini became
very happy & went with Prakash

1204
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:10,744
Is it? -Otherwise, that Amar
had almost spoiled all our plans...

1205
01:50:12,871 --> 01:50:15,852
Before Amar creates any
problem, you plan something...

1206
01:50:15,908 --> 01:50:18,855
...to finish the marriage of
Prakash and Kamini.

1207
01:50:18,944 --> 01:50:21,652
Now I will make the plans,
Rakesh.

1208
01:50:21,714 --> 01:50:27,494
The past shock of youth, how
did you dare to come here.

1209
01:50:27,553 --> 01:50:29,999
Will you go peacefully, or
shall I kick you out.

1210
01:50:30,055 --> 01:50:34,800
I am Sonia and not Sita whom
you had burnt and killed.

1211
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:40,606
If somebody even touches me,
I will see that your whole...

1212
01:50:40,666 --> 01:50:41,701
...family rots in jail.
- How dare you?

1213
01:50:44,003 --> 01:50:45,038
Don't come ahead.

1214
01:50:47,773 --> 01:50:53,121
My dear, I was just joking.
You know my habit to joke.

1215
01:50:53,178 --> 01:50:55,419
I have been telling my clear
sister just now...

1216
01:50:55,481 --> 01:50:58,462
...that Prakash should marry
only Sonia.

1217
01:50:58,784 --> 01:51:01,526
You wicked girl! You are trying
to challenge us.

1218
01:51:08,694 --> 01:51:09,536
What have you done?

1219
01:51:09,595 --> 01:51:10,938
She is the proof of that crime
which could have sent...

1220
01:51:10,996 --> 01:51:12,532
...me to my death penalty.

1221
01:51:12,598 --> 01:51:17,707
I always erase the proof
completely whether it may be...

1222
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:19,113
...Sita or Sonia.

1223
01:51:19,505 --> 01:51:21,178
What is this? -I have brought
sweets for you.

1224
01:51:21,407 --> 01:51:27,722
You came to give sweets to me.
Talk about the real matter.

1225
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:35,198
Nakadramji, our Prakash wishes
to marry your madam.

1226
01:51:35,621 --> 01:51:39,159
Are you drunk? Where is
Prakash and where is our madam?

1227
01:51:39,224 --> 01:51:42,467
I will kill you.. How did you even
think of this?

1228
01:51:42,528 --> 01:51:47,944
You please think about this.
- Should I... OK, let me think.

1229
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,947
You think about me and
I will think about you.

1230
01:51:51,003 --> 01:51:55,782
I am a public telephone...
- I understood.

1231
01:51:56,508 --> 01:52:00,456
Take this... - This is it. See
how I make a lightning call now.

1232
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:04,016
We will invest Prakash's money
in her father's Hongkong factory

1233
01:52:04,083 --> 01:52:08,190
Both of them will have a
partnership and...

1234
01:52:08,420 --> 01:52:11,196
...I will make your friendship
with madam's father

1235
01:52:11,423 --> 01:52:14,495
And then both of us will convince
madam's father and will...

1236
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,870
...do the life partnership of
madam with Prakash.

1237
01:52:16,929 --> 01:52:20,399
What shocks of brain waves?

1238
01:52:21,066 --> 01:52:24,047
Brain is not there but it
is here.

1239
01:52:24,970 --> 01:52:28,645
Tell me- How much do we have
to invest? - 50 lakhs.

1240
01:52:28,874 --> 01:52:32,515
From where will we bring so
much money.

1241
01:52:32,578 --> 01:52:36,185
You mortgage the bungalow, it is
just a matter of some days.

1242
01:52:36,782 --> 01:52:38,125
That is in the name of
Prakash's mother.

1243
01:52:38,183 --> 01:52:40,823
Can't the mother do even this much
for her son's future?

1244
01:52:42,688 --> 01:52:45,134
May be she will. But who will
give the money so quickly to us.

1245
01:52:46,892 --> 01:52:51,864
I am there. I will give the money.
Give the papers of the...

1246
01:52:51,930 --> 01:52:53,432
...Bungalow here and take
cash.

1247
01:52:53,499 --> 01:52:58,881
Why are you still standing here?
Go quickly...

1248
01:52:58,937 --> 01:53:02,646
Bring papers and take
cash..

1249
01:53:06,078 --> 01:53:11,084
Brother, think about this. This is
the last memory of my husband

1250
01:53:11,450 --> 01:53:12,952
Please sign, mother

1251
01:53:17,956 --> 01:53:22,166
This is good, my dear sister
- Let us go.

1252
01:53:50,856 --> 01:53:51,766
This is the voice of
Sita.

1253
01:53:52,591 --> 01:53:56,596
Mother, it is very late at night.
I have taken sleeping pills.

1254
01:53:56,662 --> 01:53:59,199
You also take the pills
and go to sleep.

1255
01:54:06,171 --> 01:54:07,013
What is this voice?

1256
01:54:44,476 --> 01:54:46,478
Mother-in-law!

1257
01:55:02,227 --> 01:55:06,937
I have come to meet you and
to renew the relationship.

1258
01:55:06,999 --> 01:55:14,542
Even if you got rid of me,
I won't leave you now.

1259
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:18,212
Today is the night
of black new moon...

1260
01:55:18,443 --> 01:55:20,616
We have to talk of
many sweet things.

1261
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:24,217
Today is the night
of black new moon...

1262
01:55:24,449 --> 01:55:26,725
We have to talk of
many sweet things.

1263
01:56:09,428 --> 01:56:13,069
I have come to this world to
settle the account of...

1264
01:56:13,131 --> 01:56:17,876
...the atrocities you did to me.

1265
01:56:19,938 --> 01:56:23,545
Mother-in-law would also have
been the daughter-in-law at...

1266
01:56:23,608 --> 01:56:28,853
...some time. That is what, I
have come to tell you.

1267
01:56:32,751 --> 01:56:38,599
Sisters... and people, see this
fox has done its harm.

1268
01:56:38,657 --> 01:56:43,197
But will she be able to sleep
peacefully after killing the...

1269
01:56:43,261 --> 01:56:44,968
...the poor chicken.

1270
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:49,809
She will meet the lioness
sometime or the other

1271
01:56:57,175 --> 01:57:01,419
You never realized my
value.

1272
01:57:01,713 --> 01:57:07,425
But I am crazy after you
for many ages.

1273
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:11,130
I have come from the dead
world & I will take you there...

1274
01:57:11,189 --> 01:57:14,102
...along with me. On your oath, I
will stay with you there only.

1275
01:57:15,761 --> 01:57:18,503
I have come from the dead
world & I will take you there...

1276
01:57:18,563 --> 01:57:21,840
...along with me. On your oath, I
will stay with you there only.

1277
01:57:24,836 --> 01:57:27,612
You have tortured me a lot.

1278
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:30,051
I will also torture you a lot
now.

1279
01:57:31,576 --> 01:57:36,753
The hands which had henna
will have your blood now.

1280
01:57:37,215 --> 01:57:40,526
How much ever hard you may try,
I won't leave you now.

1281
01:58:43,148 --> 01:58:50,794
You put your house on fire
and burnt my house too.

1282
01:58:51,690 --> 01:58:59,666
How you played drama with
us, my great sister-in-law

1283
01:59:01,666 --> 01:59:03,942
But the drama of spirits is
the opposite.

1284
01:59:04,002 --> 01:59:06,505
The fire will burn but
water will shower.

1285
01:59:06,571 --> 01:59:12,180
Did you understood, you fool?
Enemy to my life.

1286
01:59:17,616 --> 01:59:22,861
You burnt my dreams.

1287
01:59:24,222 --> 01:59:29,069
You separated me from
my husband.

1288
01:59:29,127 --> 01:59:31,835
Even if you go and hide
in the netherworld...

1289
01:59:31,897 --> 01:59:36,141
...I will find you and will burn
you with my fire.

1290
01:59:36,201 --> 01:59:39,580
Even if you go and hide
in the netherworld...

1291
01:59:39,638 --> 01:59:42,847
...I will find you and will burn
you with my fire.

1292
01:59:46,611 --> 01:59:49,956
Some day, the filled pot of sins
breaks down

1293
01:59:50,015 --> 01:59:58,435
Even the camels from mountains
come down.

1294
01:59:59,991 --> 02:00:05,031
How much ever you may try,
I won't leave you now.

1295
02:00:06,731 --> 02:00:09,405
Today is the night
of black new moon...

1296
02:00:09,467 --> 02:00:10,912
We have to talk of
many sweet things.

1297
02:00:22,581 --> 02:00:24,583
Why are you creating confusions,
my sister?

1298
02:00:25,884 --> 02:00:27,727
You are the enemy of this house,
my aunt

1299
02:00:27,786 --> 02:00:29,732
Aunt..
Sister..

1300
02:00:32,657 --> 02:00:36,935
Listen, my aunt, your daughter in
law's procession has come..

1301
02:00:36,995 --> 02:00:43,879
...and will trouble you the whole
night and you can't do anything

1302
02:00:43,935 --> 02:00:46,779
Hold her hands and fall
at her feet..

1303
02:00:46,838 --> 02:00:50,411
Hold her hands and fall
at her feet..

1304
02:00:50,475 --> 02:00:56,118
How much ever you try, she
won't leave you now.

1305
02:01:00,852 --> 02:01:02,763
Dance...
and sway now

1306
02:01:25,110 --> 02:01:26,748
What are you saying?

1307
02:01:27,112 --> 02:01:32,027
Nakadramji has sent orders from
the Court to seize our house.

1308
02:01:32,517 --> 02:01:34,827
Yes. -We will go and talk
with them. Come, Prakash.

1309
02:01:34,886 --> 02:01:38,698
Shantidevi, as per court's orders,
you have to vacate the house.

1310
02:01:38,757 --> 02:01:42,830
One minute Rakesh, I have to
enquire to you about..

1311
02:01:42,894 --> 02:01:46,842
...Sita Bhabhi's death.
- OK, you can go but not him.

1312
02:01:46,898 --> 02:01:50,368
But brother Sudhir
- Sit... quickly.

1313
02:01:56,875 --> 02:02:00,118
What are you speaking? Have I
taken the world's responsibility?

1314
02:02:00,178 --> 02:02:04,490
Listen... -Nagadram has no habit
of hearing nonsense. Keep the phone

1315
02:02:04,549 --> 02:02:07,029
Have you sent that notice,
Nagatamji

1316
02:02:07,419 --> 02:02:10,457
Then, has my father sent
it from the sky.

1317
02:02:10,522 --> 02:02:16,837
But why?- To procure
the money from you

1318
02:02:17,696 --> 02:02:19,141
But where is Kamini? - She has
gone on a world tour

1319
02:02:19,197 --> 02:02:24,772
When will she come? How can
we question our masters?

1320
02:02:24,836 --> 02:02:26,816
It is her wish, whether she
comes or not. - But you had...

1321
02:02:26,871 --> 02:02:32,412
You go, brother. I don't have the
habit of using my brains for free

1322
02:02:34,412 --> 02:02:35,413
Go, brother...

1323
02:02:38,950 --> 02:02:39,052
Please don't do like this.

1324
02:02:39,150 --> 02:02:45,066
Don't throw me out of my house.
Where will I go?

1325
02:02:45,123 --> 02:02:47,433
Sorry, we are under compulsion...
Shantidevi... Come...

1326
02:02:52,964 --> 02:02:54,875
Rickshaw... Go fast.

1327
02:02:55,433 --> 02:02:59,643
Shobha, where are you going?
I will also come with you.

1328
02:03:00,038 --> 02:03:03,247
How will you come with me,
mother?

1329
02:03:03,475 --> 02:03:07,048
You are used to this big
bungalow.

1330
02:03:07,112 --> 02:03:09,683
How will you stay in the small
quarters of a police officer?

1331
02:03:09,748 --> 02:03:12,661
It is better, U make some other
good arrangement for your stay.

1332
02:03:12,717 --> 02:03:18,133
Go fast... Rickshaw.
- Please wait.. Shobha

1333
02:03:18,857 --> 02:03:19,767
Bring him inside.

1334
02:03:24,062 --> 02:03:26,633
Please édo us a favor and take
back your notice

1335
02:03:26,698 --> 02:03:28,735
Or we will all be destroyed.
- You go away from here.

1336
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:31,246
Why are you troubling me?
Shall I call the servants?

1337
02:03:31,536 --> 02:03:36,679
You cheat! After destroying us,
you are doing drama now.

1338
02:03:36,741 --> 02:03:38,277
I won't leave you now.

1339
02:03:56,728 --> 02:04:00,801
Ram- Prakash, you left your
goddess like wife

1340
02:04:01,199 --> 02:04:04,578
You blemished the relationship
between me and Bhabhi.

1341
02:04:04,803 --> 02:04:08,717
When a man born from a lady's
womb insults a woman...

1342
02:04:08,773 --> 02:04:11,117
...it becomes necessary
to punish him.

1343
02:04:14,112 --> 02:04:17,582
If I wish, I can shoot you
with all the bullets

1344
02:04:19,818 --> 02:04:22,196
But between this revolver and
you, someone's desires are...

1345
02:04:22,253 --> 02:04:23,698
...standing like the wall.

1346
02:04:24,189 --> 02:04:28,103
Till you don't struggle here
and there, you won't realize...

1347
02:04:28,159 --> 02:04:30,571
...the value of a house and
a wife.

1348
02:04:30,795 --> 02:04:33,241
What is a brother and
what is destruction?

1349
02:04:34,599 --> 02:04:39,981
Bahadur, Ramsingh... throw him
out of here.

1350
02:04:41,206 --> 02:04:44,881
Amar, this is not correct.
I will get ruined and...

1351
02:04:44,943 --> 02:04:49,050
I will come to the road,
please have mercy on me.

1352
02:04:55,687 --> 02:04:59,464
Amar, what have you done?
They will come to the footpath

1353
02:04:59,624 --> 02:05:02,628
Men realizes their real worth
after coming to the footpath.

1354
02:05:02,694 --> 02:05:05,937
Have you forgotten the atrocities
they did to you?

1355
02:05:06,498 --> 02:05:08,944
But Amar...
I have to go now.

1356
02:05:10,001 --> 02:05:13,448
Bhabhi, on my oath... please
allow me to do this last drama

1357
02:05:14,739 --> 02:05:17,083
I have full belief that after this,
these people will come...

1358
02:05:17,141 --> 02:05:18,814
...to the right path.

1359
02:05:19,577 --> 02:05:21,853
Prakash, you left your
goddess like wife.

1360
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:25,650
You blemished the relationship
between me and Bhabhi.

1361
02:05:26,184 --> 02:05:28,790
When a man born from a lady's
womb insults a woman...

1362
02:05:28,853 --> 02:05:32,027
...it becomes necessary
to punish him.

1363
02:05:32,757 --> 02:05:36,637
Till you don't struggle here
and there, you won't realize...

1364
02:05:36,694 --> 02:05:39,231
...the value of a house and
a wife.

1365
02:05:39,564 --> 02:05:42,101
What is brother and
what is a wife?

1366
02:05:44,469 --> 02:05:46,710
Sister-in-law Sita.
lam Sudhir speaking.

1367
02:05:46,771 --> 02:05:51,049
Prakash has had an accident...
- What, he had an accident?

1368
02:05:51,109 --> 02:05:54,113
Yes, he is injured and is
quite serious. - Where is he?

1369
02:05:54,178 --> 02:05:56,784
In the National hospital!
- I will just come.

1370
02:05:56,948 --> 02:06:01,920
Prakash & have an accident.
You still trust them, Bhabhi

1371
02:06:01,986 --> 02:06:04,762
All this is their conspiracy.

1372
02:06:05,490 --> 02:06:08,994
Your heart also seems to have
become dirty while...

1373
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:10,903
...trying to clean other's
hearts.

1374
02:06:10,962 --> 02:06:13,568
This phone was from
brother Sudhir.

1375
02:06:26,644 --> 02:06:31,957
Doctor, take all my wealth
but save my husband.

1376
02:06:32,016 --> 02:06:36,055
Please save him -We will surely
do whatever is in our hands.

1377
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:37,121
Then it is all God's wish.

1378
02:06:47,699 --> 02:06:50,441
I am sorry, Bhabhi
Forgive me.

1379
02:06:50,969 --> 02:06:56,976
Don't mistake me, Amar.
It is none of your fault.

1380
02:06:59,644 --> 02:07:00,782
Where are you going,
Bhabhi?

1381
02:07:02,847 --> 02:07:07,523
If Savitri can bring her husband's
life from the God of Death...

1382
02:07:07,585 --> 02:07:12,000
...why can't I do it. Let me see
today, how God can ignore...

1383
02:07:12,056 --> 02:07:16,835
...my prayers and snatch my
husband from me.

1384
02:07:26,904 --> 02:07:32,252
Goddess Mother, I have come to
you to beg for my husband's life

1385
02:07:34,479 --> 02:07:38,586
Don't send me back empty-
handed. I won't go empty-handed

1386
02:08:26,764 --> 02:08:31,764
Mother Goddess...
please save him

1387
02:08:39,844 --> 02:08:45,988
You saved the ones who fell and
brought light in the darkness

1388
02:08:46,718 --> 02:08:50,666
Everything is in Your
hands and...

1389
02:08:50,722 --> 02:08:53,931
...you have removed everyone's
difficulties

1390
02:08:55,493 --> 02:08:59,532
Don't refuse my prayer...

1391
02:08:59,931 --> 02:09:03,879
Don't allow my life
to be destroyed

1392
02:09:04,135 --> 02:09:08,982
If You wish, you can make
flowers to bloom in fire

1393
02:09:10,608 --> 02:09:13,612
If You wish, you can make
a way in the ocean.

1394
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:22,427
Please save him, Mother but if
You want to take, take my life

1395
02:09:25,423 --> 02:09:33,934
Your affection for me is so old
Please help me at any time.

1396
02:09:35,466 --> 02:09:43,146
The binding of life is saying
only this.

1397
02:09:49,714 --> 02:09:57,428
Please have mercy on me as
I fully trust you.

1398
02:10:29,020 --> 02:10:33,901
You are only my mother
and You are my father

1399
02:10:34,625 --> 02:10:39,625
Please have mercy on me as
I fully trust you.

1400
02:10:50,908 --> 02:10:56,756
But how will I face her.
- Fool, Bhabhi is very good

1401
02:10:56,814 --> 02:10:58,953
I will just come - But, where
are you going?

1402
02:10:59,050 --> 02:11:00,927
You wait for sometime.
I will just come

1403
02:11:03,020 --> 02:11:05,557
Now your drama is over,
Miss Kaminidevi

1404
02:11:08,492 --> 02:11:09,527
Leave me..

1405
02:11:09,994 --> 02:11:13,066
Great, Rakesh. You have turned
the game in our favour now.

1406
02:11:13,464 --> 02:11:16,445
Sister, you came at the right
time. Recognize her.

1407
02:11:16,801 --> 02:11:18,439
She was only Kamini and
she is only Sita.

1408
02:11:18,669 --> 02:11:21,707
Today we will take complete
revenge on her- You are right.

1409
02:11:23,841 --> 02:11:26,447
You could have at least respected
my Rakhi

1410
02:11:26,844 --> 02:11:31,020
Till today, you deceived me and
took me on the wrong paths.

1411
02:11:34,085 --> 02:11:38,591
You had tried to take her life
one day, but she saved my son's

1412
02:11:38,656 --> 02:11:41,660
...life today. I don't want to lose
my daughter-in-law again.

1413
02:11:42,493 --> 02:11:43,528
Leave her

1414
02:11:43,895 --> 02:11:46,671
Wah! my emotional sister!

1415
02:11:50,568 --> 02:11:51,569
Leave me..

1416
02:11:53,371 --> 02:11:54,611
Please save me, mother

1417
02:12:09,053 --> 02:12:10,930
Prakash...- What is it, mother?

1418
02:12:11,389 --> 02:12:14,768
Rakesh has kidnapped Sita.
- Where? - To Black tower.

1419
02:12:14,859 --> 02:12:18,432
You go fast or there will be
a mishap- Black Tower!

1420
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:23,640
Leave me..

1421
02:12:27,772 --> 02:12:31,982
I would have intoxicated my
foolish nephew in liquor and

1422
02:12:32,043 --> 02:12:34,887
...by deceiving my sister with
sweet words, I would have...

1423
02:12:34,946 --> 02:12:38,189
...snatched their property long
back but you and Amar...

1424
02:12:38,416 --> 02:12:40,657
...kept giving me setbacks
again and again.

1425
02:12:41,719 --> 02:12:47,067
I have not brought you to such a
great height to show U sceneries

1426
02:12:48,592 --> 02:12:51,038
These are property papers and
this is the cheque book.

1427
02:12:51,095 --> 02:12:53,541
Sign in this immediately

1428
02:12:54,498 --> 02:12:57,001
What are you seeing?
Sign in it.

1429
02:12:58,202 --> 02:12:59,647
Sign in this.

1430
02:13:00,438 --> 02:13:01,815
See down.

1431
02:13:04,909 --> 02:13:07,446
If I throw you from this
height, even small pieces...

1432
02:13:07,545 --> 02:13:10,754
...of you will not be found.
Sign in this.

1433
02:13:11,048 --> 02:13:13,927
This property is the treasure of
my husband & mother-in-law

1434
02:13:14,085 --> 02:13:16,964
I will never sign on it. You do
whatever you want.

1435
02:13:17,555 --> 02:13:20,126
I am telling you...
I will throw you down.

1436
02:13:20,491 --> 02:13:25,770
Rakesh...
You leave Sita.

1437
02:13:25,830 --> 02:13:29,107
You delayed too much in
coming.

1438
02:13:29,166 --> 02:13:32,670
By the time you come up, this
game would be finished.

1439
02:13:33,904 --> 02:13:37,716
Enough of your drama!
You will use the pen...

1440
02:13:37,775 --> 02:13:41,245
...Sitarani or shall I use the gun.
- I won't sign.

1441
02:13:47,418 --> 02:13:49,659
Where have you come from?

1442
02:13:53,924 --> 02:13:57,929
You thought that this sparrow
can save you.

1443
02:13:58,729 --> 02:14:03,007
Sign in this...-I won't sign...
- Sign it. -No...

1444
02:14:11,008 --> 02:14:13,454
Rakesh...
- Have you reached?

1445
02:14:44,175 --> 02:14:47,782
Amar, a great mishap! Rakesh
has forcibly kidnapped...

1446
02:14:47,845 --> 02:14:50,826
...daughter Sita and taken her
to Black Tower.

1447
02:16:45,796 --> 02:16:46,638
Please forgive me, Amar.

1448
02:16:47,031 --> 02:16:51,673
Dear, the police beatings will
remove all your youthful shocks.

1449
02:16:53,804 --> 02:16:58,981
Hi, Spirit! - Fool, I had only put
duplicate bullets in Sonia's gun.

1450
02:16:59,043 --> 02:17:02,422
Sonia, make him hear his
own voice.

1451
02:17:02,479 --> 02:17:04,925
This is the acceptance
of your crime.

1452
02:17:05,216 --> 02:17:10,529
I always erase any proof that
can send me to my death penalty

1453
02:17:10,588 --> 02:17:12,932
Why are you standing here
for so long?

1454
02:17:13,023 --> 02:17:17,870
You go to jail and
grind stones. Go...

1455
02:17:21,899 --> 02:17:23,742
Thank you, Sonia.
- You are most welcome.

1456
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:26,881
These are the property papers
and cheque book...

1457
02:17:26,937 --> 02:17:32,011
...I have signed in them.- All
these property is yours.

1458
02:17:32,142 --> 02:17:36,818
Please forgive me.-This means
you have not forgiven me.

1459
02:17:37,481 --> 02:17:40,223
Don't give me such a punishment
for my sins.

1460
02:17:40,684 --> 02:17:41,958
What are you doing?

1461
02:17:44,021 --> 02:17:45,557
I love you, Sita

1462
02:17:46,690 --> 02:17:55,007
Son Amar... Amar...
- What is it, aunt?

1463
02:17:55,399 --> 02:17:57,572
Are you still angry with your
