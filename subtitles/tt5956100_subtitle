2
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,001
Salaam Aleikum.

3
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:52,376
I'm a friend. James Forward.

4
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:21,543
Target in sight.

5
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:24,168
Hold on! We're moving in.

6
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:47,251
Oh God.

7
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:20,209
There's a calm before the storm.

8
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:23,043
I've never felt anything like this
in this city before.

9
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:25,709
But something is wrong.
It feels as if...

10
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,793
...a terrifying event
is about to unfold.

11
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:31,334
Something that will change
the world forever.

12
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:33,876
We're sitting on a ticking
time bomb.

13
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,084
One that could blow
at any given time.

14
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:39,376
And they're coming. They're all
coming, dressed in black...

15
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:43,043
...and using faith as a cover
to protect their identities.

16
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:44,001
They are...

17
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:49,918
<i>Hassan!</i>

18
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:03,501
CIA?

19
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:05,751
I'm a journalist.

20
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:08,626
And what kind of journalist
keeps a gun with him?

21
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:13,084
When will you Americans stop
thinking that...

22
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:15,293
...we're not <i>as</i> stupid
as you think?

23
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,793
Please. I'm just a journalist.

24
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:20,251
Why are you doing this to me?

25
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:22,209
Let me tell you a story.

26
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:27,709
Once Uncle Sam came to our land...

27
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:32,751
...saying the Middle East needs
a new world order.

28
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:37,668
And the real reason behind it
was business and imperialism.

29
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:41,751
For that, they hired a pack
of local wolves...

30
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:45,126
And made them break their
own countrymen.

31
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:49,751
And when his job was done...

32
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:56,376
...he betrayed the pack leader
of all his promises.

33
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,751
And fled with the money.

34
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:07,709
I am that pack leader.

35
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:13,834
And now I will hunt and take
control of my land.

36
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:18,293
Ryan, strip him!

37
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:47,126
Yeah?

38
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:50,876
Adam, there's a mail in your account.
You need to check it now.

39
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:00,376
"Enough has been said.

40
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,001
"Enough has been done.

41
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:05,168
"Now it's our turn to take revenge."

42
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:06,376
God!

43
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,918
War has begun, America.
Uncle Sam...

44
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:12,126
...I'm back.

45
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,501
Connect me to the White House
immediately.

46
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:33,959
All cars northbound to lkrit!

47
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:49,834
Hurry, Miss!

48
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:53,126
I said not to call when I'm
about to leave for the hospital.

49
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:54,251
I get late.

50
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,668
Listen, Poorna.

51
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,043
The boy's family want you
to get married soon.

52
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:00,751
I'll be there in two months, Papa.

53
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,001
Want anything from here?

54
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,251
Why two months?

55
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,793
Sana! Late again for your prayers?

56
00:09:07,043 --> 00:09:10,918
No choice, Jiya. These double shifts
are killing me. I'm late every day.

57
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,376
Wow, Maria! Two phones?

58
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:16,001
Is some Sheikh crazy about you?

59
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:18,334
No! One phone is for the family.

60
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:21,834
That reminds me. My brother
called from Pakistan.

61
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:24,793
He said father was unwell again.

62
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:28,668
They're going to Lahore from Pindi
to see a heart specialist.

63
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:31,084
Tell them to go to Delhi.

64
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:34,793
Contact Dr. Trehan at AIMS Hospital.
He's the best heart surgeon there.

65
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:37,001
I trained under him.

66
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:39,959
Tell your brother to get in touch
with AIMS. I'll see to the rest.

67
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:41,418
- Really?
- Done.

68
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:43,376
Thank you so much.

69
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:47,126
Sometimes I think I should
go back home.

70
00:09:47,376 --> 00:09:50,543
- There's nothing here for us.
- You go home and then what?

71
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:52,376
You earn money and respect here.

72
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:55,251
Come on, girls. It's getting late.

73
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:58,501
- Take your lunchboxes.
- Girls, let's go.

74
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:02,918
Surprise?

75
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:05,084
Paint your hands with henna...

76
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:07,626
...decorate the wedding-palanquin!

77
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:16,418
Congratulations, Miss!

78
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:18,959
Thank you, Shaada.
Keep your eyes on the road!

79
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:26,626
Shaada...

80
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,126
...who are they?

81
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,376
ISC. After Mosul, they could be
taking over lkrit.

82
00:10:51,626 --> 00:10:52,459
Iraqi army!

83
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:53,459
Let me get out!

84
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:56,043
Shoot down the helicopter!

85
00:10:57,251 --> 00:11:00,543
- Shaada, what's going on?
- The Iraqi army is attacking.

86
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,459
<i>Shoo“</i>

87
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:07,543
Amir is hit!

88
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,251
Take aim!

89
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:15,043
Let's get to the hospital. Hurry!

90
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:20,293
Everyone, stay down!

91
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:23,251
Stay down. Shut the windows!

92
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:28,584
You, follow the bus. Now!

93
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,501
Shoot the helicopter down!

94
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:44,959
Shoot it down!

95
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,001
Go!

96
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:02,501
Close the gates!

97
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:12,084
Where's the doctor?
Open the door!

98
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:13,834
Where's the doctor?

99
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,168
Open the door now! I kill you.

100
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:21,334
Only nurses in the bus.

101
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:26,834
Doctor! Where's the doctor?

102
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:29,418
It's too early. The doctor comes in
at 8.30.

103
00:12:29,668 --> 00:12:33,459
Hey! This is a hospital.
No guns allowed.

104
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:41,793
Now everything we say is allowed.

105
00:12:42,334 --> 00:12:44,043
You don't want more men to die?

106
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:45,668
Then shut up and work fast.

107
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:48,418
Ok. I'll do it.

108
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:52,918
Get everyone out of this hospital.
Now!

109
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:56,376
Only Abu Usman and these nurses stay.

110
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:06,876
Let's go. Faster. Put them
in the ambulance.

111
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:08,709
Close the hatch. You too.

112
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:10,459
Let's go.

113
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:11,918
Get out of here! Go!

114
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:20,959
Give me the phone.

115
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:25,293
Phone!

116
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:32,043
"The big news just in...

117
00:13:32,251 --> 00:13:36,001
...the town of lkrit has been
overtaken by the ISC."

118
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:38,459
"Coming in straight from
the American base in Iraq...

119
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:40,834
...this is the second big move
by lSC."

120
00:13:41,126 --> 00:13:46,918
"The terror group ISC has taken over
the Iraqi town of lkrit."

121
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:49,709
lkrit is famous for its oil fields.

122
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:52,251
- Many Indians work there.
- Can't get through.

123
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:55,251
Indian Embassy, Baghdad.

124
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,793
My name is Maria. I'm calling
from the lkrit hospital.

125
00:13:58,043 --> 00:14:01,918
I'm a nurse. ISC is holding us Indian
and Pakistani nurses hostage.

126
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:05,709
Maria, stay calm. Don't panic.

127
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:07,209
Tell us everything.

128
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:10,251
They've shot our driver
and the hospital manager.

129
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,418
We're terrified, sir.

130
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:16,084
Their leader, Abu Usman, was shot.
He's in this hospital.

131
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:18,918
Sir, they've taken over the entire
hospital.

132
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:20,918
Sir, help us.

133
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:23,668
We're in terrible danger, sir.
They'll kill us all.

134
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:26,001
Don't worry, Maria. I'll help you.

135
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:27,668
How many nurses are you?

136
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:29,918
25 Indian and 15 Pakistani.

137
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,459
So that's 25? Ok.

138
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:34,418
Keep your phone close.

139
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
We will get in touch with you soon.

140
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,209
Connect me to Delhi.

141
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,668
- Karan, is the presentation ready?
- Absolutely, sir.

142
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,501
After their offensive in Syria,
this is lSC's biggest push into Iraq.

143
00:14:51,001 --> 00:14:54,668
In the name of religion, they're turning
young men into deadly weapons.

144
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,334
You'll soon see a human bomb
in every bus, street and airliner.

145
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:03,376
After Mosul, they've seized
the oil fields in lkrit.

146
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:07,293
They're the richest terrorist
organisation in the world today...

147
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:11,251
...because they now control
70% of Iraq's oil fields.

148
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:16,126
Sorry to disturb, sir.
You should watch the news.

149
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,709
"The horrendous act of terrorism
is nothing short of an act of war.

150
00:15:21,084 --> 00:15:23,918
"We have spoken to our British,
German and French allies...

151
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:27,293
"...to discuss targets and joint
controlled air strikes.

152
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,209
"This act shall not go..."

153
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,251
- This is not good news.
- What's happening, Shenoy?

154
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:34,751
The Americans won't take this
lying down.

155
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:40,084
They've been longing to start
air strikes on ISC targets in Iraq.

156
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:43,001
The UN has held them back.

157
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:48,334
James's execution has given them
a reason to turn lkrit to dust.

158
00:15:48,543 --> 00:15:50,543
- Meaning?
- The Americans...

159
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:53,293
...will strike the hospital where
our nurses are and where...

160
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,584
...and Abu Usman is.

161
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:58,043
The Americans will make any excuse.
They cannot be allowed to do this.

162
00:15:58,293 --> 00:15:59,918
Stop them, Shenoy!

163
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,793
Shenoy! Long time.

164
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:09,084
- When did we last meet?
- 1993. Just after the Gulf War.

165
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:12,293
I've a packed schedule.
Let's walk and talk.

166
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:15,501
- You know why I'm here?
- I know your nurses are there.

167
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,626
You can't bomb lkrit.

168
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:19,293
Yes, we can.

169
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:22,376
You know this game.
You've been here long enough.

170
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:24,626
What would you do if the nurses
were American?

171
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:27,626
- We'd get them out.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

172
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,418
For old time's sake, Adam.

173
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:32,668
Give me some time.

174
00:16:33,251 --> 00:16:34,251
Please.

175
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:39,834
Ok. Seven days.

176
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:41,876
Get your nurses out of there.

177
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,168
Eighth day we bomb lkrit.

178
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:48,126
- Seven days?
- Yes, sir.

179
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:51,626
That's not enough time to mount
a dangerous mission.

180
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:54,376
You're right, sir. But we must.

181
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:56,834
Who will do it?

182
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:01,126
Tiger.

183
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:03,834
Is Tiger alive?

184
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:08,751
I was told that he died on a mission
in Cuba eight years ago.

185
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:10,959
That was for the files.

186
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:12,668
He's hiding somewhere.

187
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,959
We'll find him.

188
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:17,168
In so little time...

189
00:17:17,543 --> 00:17:19,834
...he's the only person who can
pull it off.

190
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:23,126
Shenoy, I'm seriously not interested.

191
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,168
Just get our nurses out of there!

192
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,001
Karan, get on to all our agents.

193
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,376
I want Tiger in 24 hours.

194
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:40,709
Holidays over, Tiger.

195
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:43,334
Let's get back to work.

196
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:29,418
"Nature gave every animal an instinct
to hunt so that it can survive.

197
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:33,334
"Human beings also hunted for years
to survive...

198
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:36,543
Junior! You Brit boy!
Talking English again?

199
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:38,126
What did I tell you?

200
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:41,334
- Man is identified by his...
- ...mother tongue.

201
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:42,876
So what are you?

202
00:18:43,126 --> 00:18:46,543
Indian on your side,
Pakistani on Ma's side.

203
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,084
Don't know about your Ma...

204
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:51,709
...but when you're with me
you're fully Indian.

205
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:04,709
- Where is he?
- In front of me.

206
00:19:05,168 --> 00:19:06,959
- How far?
- 50 ft.

207
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:09,751
Look straight in his eyes,
and don't break eye contact.

208
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:17,959
He's coming closer.

209
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:20,834
I shouldn't have read that chapter
on hunting.

210
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:22,418
Calm down, Junior.

211
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,293
I'm his prey today.

212
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:26,209
Everyone hunts.

213
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,876
But no one hunts like a tiger.

214
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,459
Before he comes round,
let's split.

215
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:14,668
Wait, Junior.

216
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:17,293
Wolves don't hunt alone.

217
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:20,751
Wolves hunt in a pack.
There are more coming.

218
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:25,418
Oh shit!

219
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:27,959
- You taught you that?
- Ma says it.

220
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:29,834
Oh shit!

221
00:20:30,418 --> 00:20:33,293
- Now what?
- See our truck down there?

222
00:20:36,751 --> 00:20:40,084
On my count of three...
fly to the truck and stay there.

223
00:20:40,668 --> 00:20:43,376
One second! Are you going
to kill all those wolves?

224
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:47,709
If I don't get your friends...

225
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:50,376
...you will end up...

226
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,584
...a kebab on their menu tonight.

227
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:54,668
Maybe.

228
00:20:54,918 --> 00:20:58,751
If you save me, but do not kill
those wolves...

229
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:01,459
...then I'll believe
you're the real Tiger.

230
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:04,834
Deal?

231
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:13,709
Run!

232
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:03,126
Leave me alone! Go!

233
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:33,876
Get away!

234
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:54,876
Go away!

235
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,626
Go away!

236
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:36,251
Dad!

237
00:23:51,418 --> 00:23:53,126
Get into the truck! Hurry!

238
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:19,293
Stay still!

239
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:32,459
Junior.

240
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:34,959
One.

241
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:39,959
Two...

242
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:51,584
Yes!

243
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:10,376
Hi, Zophia. How are you?

244
00:25:10,668 --> 00:25:13,543
- Fine. And you?
- I'm good.

245
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:16,584
Finally Arthur and I've booked
our tickets to India.

246
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:18,751
It's his 80th birthday next month.

247
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:22,293
He has dreamt of seeing
the Taj Mahal all his life.

248
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:23,834
The monument of love.

249
00:25:24,543 --> 00:25:25,459
How sweet!

250
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:28,751
You think I should take some
vaccinations?

251
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:32,751
For yellow fever, malaria, dengue
and bird flu?

252
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:35,709
What other viruses are brewing there?

253
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:39,584
- Police.
- Never heard of that virus.

254
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:43,293
Call the police. There's a group
of muggers. They have a gun.

255
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,459
The money. Hurry up!

256
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:47,501
Come on, gimme the money!

257
00:26:15,126 --> 00:26:16,293
Hurry UP!

258
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:51,001
That's what we call
women empowerment!

259
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:54,959
Zoya darling, please call the cops.

260
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:11,709
Forget that piece of junk. You'll
never find your Indian station.

261
00:27:15,043 --> 00:27:15,876
Meaning?

262
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:22,626
There's only one meaning.
You're right and I'm wrong.

263
00:27:23,084 --> 00:27:25,584
- Did I say that?
- That's what you meant.

264
00:27:25,876 --> 00:27:28,793
I search for shalgum and tinde
all over Austria. Why?

265
00:27:29,043 --> 00:27:30,751
Because he only eats
Indian food.

266
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:33,251
Can you remember when we
last ate out?

267
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:36,168
You know what...

268
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:40,001
...you guys eat and leave the plates
on the table.

269
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:42,376
I'll scrub the dishes later.

270
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:48,751
Junior...

271
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,584
...your Ma is really mad at me.

272
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:57,251
Dad, let's take a walk.

273
00:27:57,501 --> 00:28:01,626
If you loved her, would you forget
your 8th wedding anniversary?

274
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:06,626
Oh!

275
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:09,709
That's why she's sulking.

276
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:14,626
- Now the drama will last for months.
- No.

277
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,126
- Here.
- What is it?

278
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:19,334
Tomorrow's programme.

279
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:21,751
I have done all the bookings.

280
00:28:22,084 --> 00:28:25,459
Make sure you make her feel
special tomorrow.

281
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:27,959
Your credit card.

282
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:30,668
I've used it six times yesterday.

283
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,418
Please add some more credit!

284
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:37,001
You son of a spy!

285
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:44,793
Sat Sri Akal. Namaskar. Adaab.

286
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:48,126
This is All India Radio, Amritsar.

287
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:52,793
We have a request from Shams Alam
from the other side of the border.

288
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:56,709
His wife, Samia Zehra,
is angry with him.

289
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:01,459
A sweet present from us.

290
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:12,459
These unspun threads...

291
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:16,376
...that I have tied around you...

292
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:21,459
...make our bond beyond separation.

293
00:29:28,293 --> 00:29:30,834
Put aside your fleeting anger...

294
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:34,334
...sweet love, listen...

295
00:29:35,668 --> 00:29:38,168
...to the conversations
in my heart.

296
00:29:39,668 --> 00:29:42,501
We sit side by side...

297
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:45,501
...looking at each other.

298
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:49,584
The conversations
in my heart...

299
00:29:51,084 --> 00:29:54,376
...we'll sit side by side
as the days pass...

300
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,084
...and fulfill the truth
of our love.

301
00:30:00,126 --> 00:30:02,084
Must you torment me?

302
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:08,918
Why pretend you don't hear...

303
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:13,293
...the conversations
in my heart?

304
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:15,876
We sit side by side...

305
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:20,251
...looking at each other.

306
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:55,834
I'll hide you from the many.
Put you on a pedestal.

307
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:57,959
You are mine.

308
00:30:58,543 --> 00:31:00,459
Keep me close to you.

309
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:03,209
There will never be any distance
between us.

310
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:06,876
Nothing will keep us apart.

311
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:13,876
I'll hide you from the many.
Put you on a pedestal.

312
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:16,251
You are mine.

313
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:18,793
Keep me close to you.

314
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,501
There will never be any distance
between us.

315
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:25,084
Nothing will keep us apart.

316
00:31:27,043 --> 00:31:29,418
I live this life for you.

317
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:39,584
You are my life.
I am yours.

318
00:31:41,668 --> 00:31:44,376
Blow hot and cold,
but don't ignore...

319
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:48,626
...the conversations
in my heart.

320
00:31:49,918 --> 00:31:52,168
We sit side by side...

321
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:55,793
...looking at each other.

322
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,418
The conversations
in my heart.

323
00:32:02,793 --> 00:32:06,084
Those dark nights.

324
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:09,293
My days are overcast.

325
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:14,001
My sweet beloved...

326
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:18,251
...hold me close.

327
00:32:20,543 --> 00:32:24,584
The sky will pale
without you.

328
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:28,668
My dreams will remain unfulfilled
without you.

329
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:31,876
The conversations
in my heart...

330
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:36,043
We sit side by side...

331
00:32:37,126 --> 00:32:39,668
...looking at each other.

332
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,793
The conversations
in my heart...

333
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:47,959
...we'll sit side by side
as the days pass...

334
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:51,626
...and fulfill the truth
of our love.

335
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:57,751
I know why you secretly glance...

336
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:03,001
...at our names written
side by side.

337
00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:06,001
The conversations
in my heart...

338
00:33:07,668 --> 00:33:10,543
We sit side by side...

339
00:33:11,376 --> 00:33:13,834
...looking at each other.

340
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:31,168
Are you still up?

341
00:33:31,668 --> 00:33:33,959
Dad, you have some friends over.

342
00:33:44,376 --> 00:33:45,626
Shenoy sir!

343
00:33:47,043 --> 00:33:49,168
Junior! Off to bed.

344
00:33:54,751 --> 00:33:56,293
Tiger.

345
00:33:58,501 --> 00:34:01,501
So many tubes? You ok?

346
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:03,459
What to do?

347
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:07,209
Since you left,
I have lost my breath.

348
00:34:10,376 --> 00:34:13,751
- My colleague, Karan.
- I know.

349
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:18,584
Zoya.

350
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:20,126
I know.

351
00:34:22,084 --> 00:34:23,084
Shall we eat?

352
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:26,959
If we're eating black lentils made
by your hands, then we'll eat.

353
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:35,376
Perfect!

354
00:34:36,043 --> 00:34:38,584
The same taste. Nothing has changed.

355
00:34:39,084 --> 00:34:43,876
He doesn't slice a tomato for me,
and he makes lentils for you.

356
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:45,293
I'm impressed.

357
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:48,834
We go back a long way.
You won't understand.

358
00:34:49,126 --> 00:34:50,501
I do, sir.

359
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:55,376
If you've come all this way
looking for your best agent...

360
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:58,251
...you won't be talking in front of me.

361
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:02,959
I'll take your leave.
Call if you need anything.

362
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:04,626
Thank you.

363
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:08,084
You've been hiding for years.

364
00:35:09,418 --> 00:35:11,168
But we found you in 24 hours.

365
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:14,376
Some rice?

366
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:23,168
For years I've sent you a coded
message: "Saare jahaan se achha."

367
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:30,043
I sent it to you from countries where
the Indian population was small.

368
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:35,668
The IP address always indicates
my exact location.

369
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:40,459
It means that you didn't need
to look for me.

370
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:44,793
I've always let you know
my whereabouts.

371
00:35:46,293 --> 00:35:48,251
The lentils are delicious.

372
00:35:49,668 --> 00:35:51,543
RAW forgot me.

373
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:55,209
I didn't forget RAW.

374
00:36:00,418 --> 00:36:02,043
Absolutely unreal.

375
00:36:03,084 --> 00:36:05,751
Sir, he has a full-blown RAW
operation room here.

376
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:08,376
He's hacked all our servers.

377
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:11,459
Tiger, the reason we're here...

378
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:15,709
...25 Indian nurses are being held
hostage in an Iraqi hospital.

379
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:18,959
The CIA has given you a week.

380
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:22,543
After that, air strikes and game over.

381
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:26,959
I've done the groundwork.

382
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:31,334
These are the best guys
you could ever find...

383
00:36:32,084 --> 00:36:34,043
...to accomplish your mission.

384
00:36:34,543 --> 00:36:36,584
Pack your bags, Tiger.

385
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,418
There's no time.

386
00:36:40,626 --> 00:36:42,918
No, sir. I'm sorry.

387
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:48,543
The Tiger you came looking for,
that Tiger has changed.

388
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:51,418
The reason...

389
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,709
...I left RAW was... Zoya.

390
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:58,959
Now I have another reason.

391
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:01,501
Junior.

392
00:37:02,209 --> 00:37:04,501
He's my life, my world...

393
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:06,751
...and my weakness.

394
00:37:07,043 --> 00:37:09,751
Sir, we need you on this mission.

395
00:37:10,334 --> 00:37:11,959
We're wasting precious time.

396
00:37:12,293 --> 00:37:15,834
Now we know where you live,
and who your family is...

397
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:19,251
Karan, the tiger is sleeping.

398
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:24,668
Don't pull its tail. It'll devour you.

399
00:37:28,543 --> 00:37:31,459
India's honour is at stake.

400
00:37:34,626 --> 00:37:37,293
Well, you know better.

401
00:37:45,584 --> 00:37:47,043
"Bhagat Singh shouts...

402
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:50,043
"Long live the revolution!"

403
00:38:10,334 --> 00:38:11,834
What is it, Tiger?

404
00:38:18,334 --> 00:38:19,668
Nothing really.

405
00:38:20,584 --> 00:38:23,876
Everyone believes you love me
more than anything in the world.

406
00:38:25,584 --> 00:38:28,709
But I know that you love
your country even more.

407
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,918
And that's the thing I respect
about you the most.

408
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:40,543
You're the world's biggest hero
for him.

409
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:47,334
How will he feel if he knew that his
parents were two agents on the run...

410
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:52,376
...who have put duty behind them,
and live a life of leisure now.

411
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:58,918
In your place, I'd go and rescue
those nurses.

412
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,501
And yes...

413
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:05,876
...always remember...

414
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:10,376
Junior and I are not your weakness.

415
00:39:11,876 --> 00:39:12,959
We're your strength.

416
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:05,043
Hello, sir.

417
00:40:06,543 --> 00:40:08,043
Some money, sir.

418
00:40:08,418 --> 00:40:12,084
The team will meet you at the
Turkey-Iraq border.

419
00:40:12,418 --> 00:40:13,793
I'll send you their details.

420
00:40:14,126 --> 00:40:16,959
This is my mission. And my team.

421
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,043
- Sir, you're taking over.
- You want to?

422
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,251
No, sir.

423
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:24,918
- Time is short.
- So don't waste it.

424
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:27,626
This is my team.

425
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:30,876
Azaan Akbar, the Indian army's
best sniper.

426
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:34,001
If he wasn't busy in covert
operations...

427
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:36,876
...he'd be winning gold medals
for India.

428
00:40:43,793 --> 00:40:46,043
Namit Khanna, bombs and
explosives expert.

429
00:40:52,293 --> 00:40:54,418
He's diffused 4 bombs in 3 minutes.

430
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:56,959
Saved many lives in the Kashmir
valley.

431
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,168
Rakesh Sharma, a senior citizen.

432
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:12,001
A bit frail but has a technical brain
that can outsmart NASA's best.

433
00:41:23,334 --> 00:41:24,834
Long live Lord Hanuman!

434
00:41:26,793 --> 00:41:28,959
Wow, sir. You've done your homework.

435
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:31,584
Mother made sure I did.

436
00:41:32,668 --> 00:41:35,084
Sir, will they get here in time?

437
00:41:39,001 --> 00:41:41,251
Namit, Azaan.

438
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,543
Rakeshji!

439
00:41:45,293 --> 00:41:46,834
Very nice. Super.

440
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:48,584
Welcome!

441
00:41:49,418 --> 00:41:50,001
Yes, Karan?

442
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:51,751
Tiger is insisting on his team.

443
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:53,543
He says it's his mission.

444
00:41:53,793 --> 00:41:55,043
I expected this.

445
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:57,168
We won't have any control.

446
00:41:57,459 --> 00:41:59,251
We have no choice.

447
00:41:59,709 --> 00:42:02,543
There's something worth remembering...

448
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:03,793
Sir?

449
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:07,959
He has lived with Zoya, a Pakistani
agent, for 8 years.

450
00:42:11,543 --> 00:42:15,126
- Make sure she did not turn him.
- Absolutely, sir.

451
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:23,751
Make your way to Al-Nusra on the
Iraq-Turkey border.

452
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:31,918
All illegal human traffic into Iraq
passes through there.

453
00:42:34,584 --> 00:42:35,334
That's where...

454
00:42:35,584 --> 00:42:38,668
...ISC loads up their tankers
with oil...

455
00:42:39,043 --> 00:42:42,751
...and dispatches them to the Mosul
and lkrit oil refineries.

456
00:42:44,126 --> 00:42:49,459
Our man Zulfikar has worked for
RAW for 8 years. He'll meet you there.

457
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:54,459
Zulfikar will hide you in an oil
tanker and smuggle you into Iraq.

458
00:43:11,043 --> 00:43:13,668
The convoy usually has 8 trucks.

459
00:43:14,668 --> 00:43:18,709
Zulfikar will fill water instead
of oil into one of the trucks.

460
00:43:19,251 --> 00:43:22,584
He'll pour oil over the water
to camouflage it.

461
00:43:29,876 --> 00:43:36,751
lkrit is 3 hours from the border.
You'll soon be journeying into Iraq.

462
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:56,043
Everyone, out!

463
00:43:57,084 --> 00:44:00,626
Nothing moves without lSC's
permission.

464
00:44:01,168 --> 00:44:03,751
The tankers are often checked
at the border.

465
00:44:36,168 --> 00:44:37,293
Long live Lord Hanuman!

466
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:39,584
The plan, sir?

467
00:44:40,126 --> 00:44:41,959
We can't walk into the hospital...

468
00:44:43,376 --> 00:44:46,543
...so we'll pass off as illegal
oil refinery workers.

469
00:44:46,959 --> 00:44:49,418
There, Namit will set off
a controlled blast.

470
00:44:49,709 --> 00:44:51,793
They'll think it's an accident.

471
00:44:52,084 --> 00:44:54,834
We'll act as if we've suffered burns
in the blast.

472
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:57,376
The ISC will have no choice.

473
00:44:57,709 --> 00:45:01,793
They'll have to send the injured
workers to the lkrit hospital.

474
00:45:02,293 --> 00:45:04,126
Once we're in the hospital...

475
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:08,543
...we'll have two days to get
the nurses out.

476
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:12,501
And send Abu Usman...

477
00:45:13,793 --> 00:45:17,959
You make it sound so easy,
if your plan is that easy...

478
00:45:18,334 --> 00:45:22,084
...I'll go straight on a pilgrimage
to Amarnath.

479
00:45:22,459 --> 00:45:26,626
If it works or not, you're headed
on a pilgrimage anyway.

480
00:45:26,918 --> 00:45:28,668
Pawan's number.

481
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,501
The RAW agent there.

482
00:45:31,126 --> 00:45:33,668
He'll get you whatever you need.

483
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:37,001
You'll need to tell him the
recognition code.

484
00:45:37,376 --> 00:45:39,834
"Tu tu tu tutu tara."

485
00:45:41,043 --> 00:45:44,043
The answer to the code is:
"Our friend is here."

486
00:45:44,626 --> 00:45:46,001
ls RAW into comedy these days?

487
00:45:46,418 --> 00:45:48,751
Not my idea, sir. It came
from the bosses.

488
00:45:49,459 --> 00:45:50,626
Coming to the point.

489
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:52,751
If you're lucky...

490
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:57,168
...and manage to get into this
heavily-guarded oil refinery...

491
00:45:57,793 --> 00:45:59,293
...then the mission starts.

492
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:00,584
And yours ends.

493
00:46:02,043 --> 00:46:05,584
Tell Mr Shenoy, "Tu tu tu tutu tara."

494
00:46:06,418 --> 00:46:10,001
"Tiger is back on the prowl again!"

495
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:41,334
Stay in line!

496
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:50,626
Amir Baghdawi is coming.

497
00:47:03,793 --> 00:47:06,084
This is Amir al-Baghdawi.

498
00:47:06,376 --> 00:47:08,376
LSC's number 2.

499
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:12,834
The oil fields and refineries
are under his control.

500
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:24,084
After Abu Usman, he's the second
in command.

501
00:47:24,459 --> 00:47:27,251
He's the ISC oil deal-maker.

502
00:47:28,168 --> 00:47:30,293
Watch out for another man.

503
00:47:31,418 --> 00:47:35,751
They call him "Thu'ban"
in Arabic. Means "snake."

504
00:47:36,084 --> 00:47:39,751
Pasha Baghdawi! My Amir.

505
00:47:40,168 --> 00:47:42,251
One meeting.

506
00:47:43,209 --> 00:47:45,543
- One meeting.
- Back! Or I'll shoot you.

507
00:47:46,168 --> 00:47:48,751
I give you. This is Indian.
Hollywood.

508
00:47:49,209 --> 00:47:50,709
One meeting.

509
00:47:51,043 --> 00:47:52,709
- Go back!
- Why?

510
00:47:53,001 --> 00:47:55,209
I give everything. You show gun.

511
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:56,876
Back! What did I say.

512
00:47:57,209 --> 00:47:58,209
Ok!

513
00:48:00,209 --> 00:48:01,668
Just you wait, sonny.

514
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:06,543
If I don't hang you out to dry,
my name isn't Thu'ban.

515
00:48:06,918 --> 00:48:08,668
His real name is Firdaus.

516
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,876
He's an Indian but has lived
in Iraq for 25 years.

517
00:48:13,084 --> 00:48:17,293
From the era of Saddam and America
to ISC, he has contacts everywhere.

518
00:48:17,751 --> 00:48:22,126
He supplies the oil refineries with
illegal labour.

519
00:48:22,918 --> 00:48:26,209
He'd sell his parents for money.

520
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:29,209
He has only one purpose now...

521
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:32,918
...to get close to Amir al-Baghdawi.

522
00:48:35,251 --> 00:48:37,209
- Where from?
- Bangladesh.

523
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:40,709
Work hard or I'll break your legs.

524
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:44,918
If I see you nodding off at work,
I'll sting you in the neck.

525
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:46,501
Go!

526
00:48:47,251 --> 00:48:48,251
And listen...

527
00:48:49,084 --> 00:48:50,959
...fill out the paperwork correctly.

528
00:48:51,418 --> 00:48:54,418
They drop dead and get us into trouble.

529
00:48:55,334 --> 00:48:56,626
From India?

530
00:48:58,626 --> 00:49:02,751
Are you a newly wed?
So, take off that veil!

531
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:06,751
Now I can see the bride!

532
00:49:08,876 --> 00:49:10,543
- A labourer?
- No.

533
00:49:10,918 --> 00:49:12,459
Junior engineer.

534
00:49:13,126 --> 00:49:15,043
I have an lTl diploma.

535
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:20,001
They are the labourers.

536
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:24,168
You're no engineer.
And they're no labourers.

537
00:49:24,834 --> 00:49:25,793
Remember...

538
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:27,793
...I'll be watching you.

539
00:49:28,418 --> 00:49:33,084
If you make any trouble, no one
will ever find your dead bodies.

540
00:49:34,376 --> 00:49:35,209
Get going!

541
00:49:44,293 --> 00:49:45,959
You're in room 69.

542
00:49:46,376 --> 00:49:49,043
Don't be late for work or the boss
will blow a fuse.

543
00:49:54,418 --> 00:49:56,418
My childhood dreams are coming true
in old age.

544
00:49:56,709 --> 00:49:58,584
Ah! Sleeping on a bunk bed!

545
00:49:59,168 --> 00:50:02,668
Namit, I'm putting my bag up here.

546
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,709
I want the upper bed.

547
00:50:06,126 --> 00:50:07,376
Let the bag be.

548
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:11,668
What's the big deal about your bag?
ls the Quran in it?

549
00:50:18,709 --> 00:50:21,376
What difference does it make
what I have in it?

550
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:23,626
It stays on the upper bunk.

551
00:50:27,334 --> 00:50:29,376
Ok. Leave your bag there.

552
00:50:29,876 --> 00:50:32,251
- Thank you.
- Tell me what's in the bag.

553
00:50:32,626 --> 00:50:34,084
- I won't.
- Open it!

554
00:50:34,293 --> 00:50:35,418
- No.
- Open it!

555
00:50:35,709 --> 00:50:36,543
Azaan...

556
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:46,959
Here, sir.

557
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:53,668
Fold it properly. Put it away.

558
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:59,209
Why not write "Indian army sniper"
on your forehead instead?

559
00:50:59,543 --> 00:51:00,751
"Here to rescue the nurses."

560
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:04,209
The ISC guys fly their flag
everywhere...

561
00:51:04,709 --> 00:51:06,959
...when we're done,
I'll fly our flag.

562
00:51:07,543 --> 00:51:12,793
So the scum realize that Indians
are no less brave.

563
00:51:13,334 --> 00:51:14,126
That's it, sir.

564
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:26,709
Your bag.

565
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:30,376
- Thank you, Namit.
- Ok now?

566
00:51:30,751 --> 00:51:32,001
Bravo!

567
00:51:32,709 --> 00:51:34,001
But Azaan...

568
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:39,334
Being passionate is one thing,
expressing it is another.

569
00:51:41,709 --> 00:51:43,376
We're RAW agents.

570
00:51:57,793 --> 00:52:00,501
How many more days I have
to stay here?

571
00:52:01,043 --> 00:52:03,959
I think you'll recover in about
4 to 5 days.

572
00:52:04,584 --> 00:52:05,834
Why did you save my life?

573
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:07,334
It's my duty.

574
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:12,209
My duty doesn't differentiate
between people or what they do.

575
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:16,793
No one has come to rescue us.
Trust me. We'll all be killed.

576
00:52:17,084 --> 00:52:20,209
Sana, I've spoken to the Ambassador.
He'll talk to ISC.

577
00:52:20,418 --> 00:52:21,793
And they'll listen?

578
00:52:22,793 --> 00:52:25,001
They're crazy. Crazy.

579
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:27,001
Are you an Indian?

580
00:52:30,626 --> 00:52:32,084
Your Hindi is good.

581
00:52:32,668 --> 00:52:35,209
My father was the Syrian ambassador
in Delhi.

582
00:52:35,709 --> 00:52:38,293
I was 8 when we moved there.

583
00:52:39,668 --> 00:52:41,209
Chanakyapuri.

584
00:52:41,709 --> 00:52:44,168
I went to school for 8 years there.

585
00:52:45,168 --> 00:52:47,751
Hindustani is a beautiful language.

586
00:52:48,793 --> 00:52:50,918
When I was studying in Oxford...

587
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,959
...the subject of my thesis were
the poets Ghalib and Iqbal.

588
00:52:54,293 --> 00:52:55,501
Amazing!

589
00:52:56,334 --> 00:53:00,043
How could anyone wield a gun having
studied these great poets?

590
00:53:02,251 --> 00:53:04,334
I'm going. I can't take it.

591
00:53:04,543 --> 00:53:06,793
You crazy? if they catch you,
they'll kill you.

592
00:53:07,043 --> 00:53:09,043
They'll kill us anyway.

593
00:53:10,584 --> 00:53:11,293
Sana...

594
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:14,418
If one of us escapes,
we can get help.

595
00:53:15,876 --> 00:53:17,793
- Let me go.
- Sana!

596
00:53:18,584 --> 00:53:22,334
I was a professor...at a New York
languages school.

597
00:53:23,251 --> 00:53:25,334
I was teaching the world poetry.

598
00:53:26,459 --> 00:53:30,918
After 9/11, they arrested me at a
train station without any evidence.

599
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:33,293
Only because of my name.

600
00:53:50,834 --> 00:53:52,418
Get down! Move.

601
00:53:56,626 --> 00:53:58,543
Hurry! Keep your head down.

602
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:14,376
Three years...

603
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,959
I was imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay
for three years.

604
00:54:18,334 --> 00:54:21,334
I was left naked. They tied a dog
collar around my neck.

605
00:54:21,834 --> 00:54:24,209
The American soldiers used
to urinate on us.

606
00:54:36,626 --> 00:54:40,501
A man does not die when
he stops breathing...

607
00:54:41,418 --> 00:54:46,126
...a man dies when his dignity
is snatched away from him.

608
00:54:50,501 --> 00:54:54,876
Now every person that you see here
no longer fears death.

609
00:55:07,459 --> 00:55:08,376
Sana!

610
00:55:08,709 --> 00:55:10,459
Get back inside!
Or I'll shoot everyone.

611
00:55:17,751 --> 00:55:18,959
Allah!

612
00:55:20,793 --> 00:55:21,959
A nurse tried to escape.

613
00:55:22,834 --> 00:55:23,834
Shoot her!

614
00:55:25,584 --> 00:55:26,918
It's ok.

615
00:55:27,584 --> 00:55:30,251
Please don't do this.
They're nurses.

616
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:34,459
- Don't panic!
- Don't do this, please.

617
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:38,043
This is going to make you
a much stronger person.

618
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:01,834
Salaam Aleikum.

619
00:56:08,918 --> 00:56:09,793
Sir.

620
00:56:10,543 --> 00:56:12,376
- I need a month's leave, sir.
- Why?

621
00:56:12,709 --> 00:56:14,501
I must go to India.
My wife's pregnant.

622
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:18,751
You're here, and your wife
is pregnant?

623
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,626
Didn't that happen last year too?
God be praised!

624
00:56:21,834 --> 00:56:26,584
Strong Wi-Fi! It does the business
from this far? Get lost!

625
00:56:31,834 --> 00:56:34,001
Wait! Pass me the binoculars.

626
00:56:34,418 --> 00:56:37,543
Rakeshji, the control room is yours.

627
00:56:38,084 --> 00:56:42,584
Azaan, keep a watch from
a safe place.

628
00:56:49,668 --> 00:56:52,626
Namit, your job is the most important
of all.

629
00:56:53,168 --> 00:56:55,251
The oil refinery.

630
00:56:55,709 --> 00:56:59,959
Make sure your bomb doesn't
wipe us all out.

631
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:04,834
I have a wife, and Junior is
very young.

632
00:57:05,251 --> 00:57:06,209
Go easy.

633
00:57:08,709 --> 00:57:11,709
This damn guy is plotting something.

634
00:57:28,501 --> 00:57:29,501
Hello.

635
00:57:29,876 --> 00:57:31,959
"Tu tu tu tutu tara."

636
00:57:33,459 --> 00:57:36,168
"Tu tu tu tutu tara."

637
00:57:37,793 --> 00:57:39,001
"Our friend is here."

638
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:44,668
Once is ok. You kidding me?

639
00:57:45,751 --> 00:57:47,709
- So you're here?
- Arrived yesterday.

640
00:57:48,209 --> 00:57:50,793
I have some Indian friends
who want to eat Indian food.

641
00:57:51,209 --> 00:57:52,709
What do you want?

642
00:57:53,001 --> 00:57:55,834
Half a kilo of Kashmiri chillies...

643
00:57:56,168 --> 00:57:58,751
...and some vegetables.

644
00:57:59,251 --> 00:58:02,876
Half a kilo of Kashmiri chillies?
Want everyone to get the runs?

645
00:58:03,584 --> 00:58:07,043
We're Indians. We love masala.

646
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,209
Need anything else?

647
00:58:10,043 --> 00:58:14,251
The floor plan of the place
where the Indians are held.

648
00:58:14,876 --> 00:58:18,043
How many guard them?

649
00:58:18,334 --> 00:58:19,834
Slow down!

650
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:22,293
I need more than a day.

651
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:25,334
<i>I'll try.</i>

652
00:58:25,834 --> 00:58:29,334
Meet me tomorrow at 2. Al Shamsi
Kebab corner. Bada Bazaar.

653
00:58:29,751 --> 00:58:30,584
Ok.

654
00:58:43,001 --> 00:58:44,084
Number's changed.

655
00:58:45,084 --> 00:58:47,668
Sonny, you're sharp.

656
00:58:48,334 --> 00:58:52,834
Don't forget, I won't let you do what
you came here to do.

657
00:58:58,709 --> 00:59:01,084
Gary! My friend.

658
00:59:01,543 --> 00:59:05,418
Tuesday morning breakfast.
I'll see you.

659
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:08,126
Good American breakfast.

660
00:59:17,334 --> 00:59:18,293
So?

661
00:59:18,709 --> 00:59:20,084
Mr. Sam Jacobs.

662
00:59:21,543 --> 00:59:24,584
Is America planning another
air strike?

663
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:29,418
Why don't you people understand...

664
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:32,459
- ...that God is with us?
- Stop using His name!

665
00:59:33,584 --> 00:59:34,834
God is for peace.

666
00:59:35,126 --> 00:59:37,334
You think we don't know
what's your plan?

667
00:59:38,084 --> 00:59:39,126
Hassan...

668
00:59:41,543 --> 00:59:44,418
Your friend, James Forward,
left this for us.

669
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:49,959
He's 13.

670
00:59:50,459 --> 00:59:53,209
His whole family died in
a drone strike in Syria.

671
00:59:53,543 --> 00:59:56,126
Including his four year-old sister.

672
00:59:57,876 --> 01:00:01,834
My father used to say:
"Small coffins are the heaviest."

673
01:00:02,293 --> 01:00:04,751
For God's sake. Please don't do this.

674
01:00:06,543 --> 01:00:08,168
Please don't do this.

675
01:00:21,709 --> 01:00:22,626
Hakim...

676
01:00:23,001 --> 01:00:25,084
If he tries to escape, shoot him.

677
01:01:01,334 --> 01:01:06,793
Let's unite against oppression,
aggression, corruption and terrorism.

678
01:01:26,126 --> 01:01:27,834
"Tu tu tu tutu tara."

679
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:29,918
"Our friend is here."

680
01:01:30,293 --> 01:01:31,793
Table 7. I'll join you.

681
01:01:48,334 --> 01:01:49,459
<i>Hassan.</i>

682
01:01:50,459 --> 01:01:51,459
No Ho."

683
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:57,584
"H...a...s...s...an."

684
01:02:05,709 --> 01:02:08,043
Where's Mummy? Daddy?

685
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,293
Me? Avinash.

686
01:02:13,126 --> 01:02:14,793
Avinash Rathod.

687
01:02:15,459 --> 01:02:17,418
My son, Junior...

688
01:02:18,876 --> 01:02:19,876
<i>- - NUT Egg</i>

689
01:02:20,376 --> 01:02:23,293
Nice face. Beautiful eyes.

690
01:02:32,209 --> 01:02:33,293
What's going on?

691
01:02:36,084 --> 01:02:38,751
- What's the protest?
- He's an Iraqi...

692
01:02:39,709 --> 01:02:41,584
...protesting against ISC.

693
01:02:41,876 --> 01:02:48,001
This is the Iraqi army's last hold on
the city. The ISC want to take over.

694
01:02:50,251 --> 01:02:51,959
You need this to make a bomb.

695
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:56,668
There are 25 men guarding
the hospital and Abu Usman.

696
01:03:03,918 --> 01:03:05,459
I need the hospital floor plan.

697
01:03:05,876 --> 01:03:07,751
That'll take more time.

698
01:03:08,334 --> 01:03:11,626
It's in the City Council building
under ISC control.

699
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,876
Freedom!

700
01:03:58,793 --> 01:03:59,584
Shit.

701
01:04:02,668 --> 01:04:05,418
ISC is not Islam.

702
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:07,876
Someone has taken Hassan.

703
01:04:12,751 --> 01:04:14,043
Go away!

704
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:18,834
<i>Let gm!</i>

705
01:04:27,709 --> 01:04:29,668
Bomb. Go!

706
01:04:30,251 --> 01:04:31,376
Don't be scared.

707
01:04:32,584 --> 01:04:33,584
Don't be scared.

708
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,626
Tiger! What are you doing?

709
01:04:43,584 --> 01:04:44,501
Oh shit.

710
01:04:44,751 --> 01:04:47,168
- He's an ISC human bomb.
- I know.

711
01:04:47,459 --> 01:04:49,084
This is not our job.

712
01:04:49,376 --> 01:04:50,626
Sure it is.

713
01:04:51,001 --> 01:04:52,793
Tiger! You'll get us all killed.

714
01:04:54,876 --> 01:04:59,418
- This innocent boy is my son's age.
- A timer! 45 seconds to go.

715
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:06,501
Tiger, they're here. No time left.

716
01:05:06,709 --> 01:05:08,126
We're right on time.

717
01:05:08,418 --> 01:05:11,793
You clear the square. I'll clear them
off this planet.

718
01:05:15,293 --> 01:05:17,876
ISC is here! Clear the square.

719
01:05:19,209 --> 01:05:20,626
Clear the square!

720
01:05:27,543 --> 01:05:29,001
I've found Hassan.

721
01:06:06,209 --> 01:06:08,209
- Take care of the kid.
- Let's go.

722
01:07:41,084 --> 01:07:42,126
Take a right!

723
01:07:46,876 --> 01:07:47,918
Stop!

724
01:08:11,126 --> 01:08:12,376
Take a left up ahead.

725
01:08:44,459 --> 01:08:45,376
Damn!

726
01:10:01,334 --> 01:10:02,876
Take the kid to the Indian Embassy.

727
01:11:05,084 --> 01:11:07,168
No one move!

728
01:11:09,626 --> 01:11:11,251
Give me the kid!

729
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,043
Or I shoot.

730
01:11:33,793 --> 01:11:37,126
- How come you're here?
- I'll tell you. Who's the kid?

731
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:38,959
<i>I'll</i> tell you.

732
01:11:40,126 --> 01:11:41,293
Hassan, down!

733
01:12:21,293 --> 01:12:23,584
Surround them. Hurry!
Get them out of the car.

734
01:12:58,751 --> 01:12:59,459
NOW!

735
01:13:45,334 --> 01:13:46,584
They're my guys.

736
01:13:46,834 --> 01:13:48,168
Meaning?

737
01:13:48,793 --> 01:13:49,709
What the...

738
01:13:51,584 --> 01:13:52,251
...hell!

739
01:13:53,001 --> 01:13:57,084
You and RAW only heard
about the Indian nurses...

740
01:13:58,293 --> 01:14:00,543
...but there are 15 Pakistani
nurses too.

741
01:14:08,001 --> 01:14:09,709
That's why you came?

742
01:14:10,209 --> 01:14:12,376
Must I let those nurses die?

743
01:14:12,793 --> 01:14:15,543
I convinced you to help.
And I mustn't?

744
01:14:16,376 --> 01:14:20,293
15 minutes ago they shot our agent,
Pawan.

745
01:14:21,043 --> 01:14:23,459
This young Hassan had a bomb...

746
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:26,126
...tied to him. They'd have
blown him up.

747
01:14:26,668 --> 01:14:30,126
132 children were killed by terrorists
in Pakistan.

748
01:14:30,876 --> 01:14:32,834
Were the kids to blame?

749
01:14:34,209 --> 01:14:39,001
Because of a few troublemakers, my
country is misunderstood by the world.

750
01:14:39,501 --> 01:14:41,751
Pakistanis want peace...

751
01:14:43,626 --> 01:14:47,126
...so that their children can study
without fear.

752
01:14:47,709 --> 01:14:51,168
Prosper and bring honour
to their country.

753
01:14:51,918 --> 01:14:55,543
This mission is not only about
saving those nurses...

754
01:14:56,543 --> 01:15:00,251
...it's also about restoring respect
to my country.

755
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:03,959
And telling the world that
we stand for peace.

756
01:15:30,334 --> 01:15:32,209
Let's do it together.

757
01:15:33,126 --> 01:15:34,293
A joint mission.

758
01:15:36,668 --> 01:15:37,709
What?

759
01:15:38,084 --> 01:15:39,043
You and I.

760
01:15:39,418 --> 01:15:40,918
ISI and RAW.

761
01:15:41,418 --> 01:15:44,251
First time. We'll carry out
the mission together.

762
01:15:45,376 --> 01:15:49,001
Are you in your right senses?
Have you gone mad?

763
01:15:51,751 --> 01:15:53,501
What are you saying, sir?

764
01:15:54,043 --> 01:15:55,834
You know we're enemies.

765
01:15:56,376 --> 01:15:58,001
A mission with Pakistan?

766
01:15:58,751 --> 01:16:02,584
Hear that? Didn't I tell you we'd
just be stirring up muck?

767
01:16:02,959 --> 01:16:05,334
Muck? What muck?

768
01:16:05,876 --> 01:16:07,918
We arrested some of their men
in Kashmir.

769
01:16:08,418 --> 01:16:11,001
- We know what you're up to.
- What?

770
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:13,418
Don't get us talking.

771
01:16:13,751 --> 01:16:15,543
- If we did...
- Then?

772
01:16:16,043 --> 01:16:17,709
If you can talk, so can we.

773
01:16:17,918 --> 01:16:18,918
WOW!

774
01:16:19,418 --> 01:16:21,418
That's called true enmity!

775
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:27,251
Rakeshji, logic dictates that...

776
01:16:27,543 --> 01:16:30,584
...if we didn't work together
we'll get in each other's way.

777
01:16:31,501 --> 01:16:34,793
If we worked together,
there's a chance...

778
01:16:35,334 --> 01:16:39,626
...we could send our girls home,
safe and sound.

779
01:16:41,168 --> 01:16:45,668
I know there are many problems
between our countries.

780
01:16:46,876 --> 01:16:49,084
They may never get resolved.

781
01:16:50,543 --> 01:16:52,209
But this is about humanity.

782
01:16:58,001 --> 01:16:59,376
You guys...

783
01:17:00,209 --> 01:17:01,376
...are trained agents...

784
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:03,209
...adults, matured.

785
01:17:03,668 --> 01:17:05,501
Now we'll see if you're...

786
01:17:06,543 --> 01:17:08,334
...sensible or not.

787
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,584
What about Hassan?

788
01:17:12,834 --> 01:17:15,668
Capt. Abrar knows an Iraqi safe house.

789
01:17:16,668 --> 01:17:18,501
Hassan can stay there.

790
01:17:25,251 --> 01:17:26,376
Where's Junior?

791
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:27,959
I sold him.

792
01:17:30,168 --> 01:17:31,501
He's in India.

793
01:17:32,043 --> 01:17:33,126
With Zophia.

794
01:17:33,376 --> 01:17:35,876
Our son is in India at last.

795
01:17:37,293 --> 01:17:39,334
I can't accept it.

796
01:17:40,668 --> 01:17:43,876
I know that Tiger's logic
makes sense.

797
01:17:45,709 --> 01:17:49,168
I was born around the time
of the Partition...

798
01:17:49,793 --> 01:17:51,543
That's when I was born.

799
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,834
But imagine this, if the border
had not been drawn...

800
01:17:57,001 --> 01:17:59,334
...cricketers Akram and Sachin
would play in the same team.

801
01:17:59,668 --> 01:18:01,626
Then all the World Cups
would be ours!

802
01:18:02,334 --> 01:18:03,668
You're right!

803
01:18:03,959 --> 01:18:05,834
My father would agree with you.

804
01:18:06,168 --> 01:18:07,543
Just imagine...

805
01:18:07,876 --> 01:18:10,626
...if Lata Bibi, Kishore Kumar,
Mohammed Rafi...

806
01:18:10,918 --> 01:18:14,001
...Abida Parveen and Nusrat Fateh
Ali Khan sang on stage together.

807
01:18:14,334 --> 01:18:15,626
Just imagine...

808
01:18:16,084 --> 01:18:20,168
...if the money that both countries
spend on defense budgets...

809
01:18:20,626 --> 01:18:23,751
...could be used instead for roads,
education, power and water...

810
01:18:24,043 --> 01:18:25,793
...and cutting unemployment.

811
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:27,751
And Pakistani girls?

812
01:18:31,709 --> 01:18:34,126
- They're so beautiful.
- Sir!

813
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:38,793
Remember how Sunny Deol eloped
with a Pakistani in Gadar?

814
01:18:39,209 --> 01:18:40,209
- So?
- So what?

815
01:18:40,459 --> 01:18:41,668
Big deal!

816
01:18:42,001 --> 01:18:44,043
Remember our tennis player
fell in love...

817
01:18:44,293 --> 01:18:45,709
...with your Pakistani cricketer?

818
01:18:45,918 --> 01:18:47,584
Wonderful, no?

819
01:18:47,959 --> 01:18:49,793
But he has lost his touch!

820
01:18:51,209 --> 01:18:52,668
You intellectuals!

821
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:08,876
- Zoya Bibi!
- Tiger sir!

822
01:19:20,709 --> 01:19:21,793
Your decision?

823
01:19:22,293 --> 01:19:23,084
RAW?

824
01:19:23,626 --> 01:19:24,334
Isl?

825
01:19:27,793 --> 01:19:29,501
Let's work together...

826
01:19:30,001 --> 01:19:31,793
...against a common enemy.

827
01:19:32,668 --> 01:19:34,084
You mean...

828
01:19:34,501 --> 01:19:38,334
...the groom's and the bride's families
will work together?

829
01:21:25,501 --> 01:21:28,001
"The latest coming in from lkrit,
Iraq is that...

830
01:21:28,251 --> 01:21:30,501
"...the ISC hold has become stronger."

831
01:21:30,709 --> 01:21:31,876
"US special forces...

832
01:21:32,084 --> 01:21:34,126
"...are getting ready to move in
at any time...

833
01:21:34,376 --> 01:21:36,918
"...as per the latest report
from the White House.

834
01:21:37,126 --> 01:21:39,709
"Last week they confirmed possible
US air strikes."

835
01:21:40,043 --> 01:21:45,209
"25 Indian nurses are being held
hostage in this hospital.

836
01:21:45,459 --> 01:21:46,626
"Days have past...

837
01:21:46,876 --> 01:21:51,959
"...but the Indian government have
not rescued the nurses as yet."

838
01:21:52,168 --> 01:21:54,334
Tiger has teamed up with ISI
for the mission.

839
01:21:55,251 --> 01:21:56,001
But why?

840
01:21:56,209 --> 01:21:58,501
Zoya wants to save
the Pakistani nurses.

841
01:22:00,376 --> 01:22:02,418
The mission is a family affair now.

842
01:22:04,418 --> 01:22:07,668
You didn't tell me 15 Pakistani
nurses are held hostage, too?

843
01:22:07,918 --> 01:22:11,959
We wanted our nurses to be priority.

844
01:22:12,543 --> 01:22:15,418
- And get our girls safely home.
- Shenoy...

845
01:22:15,751 --> 01:22:18,959
There are many political problems
between India and Pakistan.

846
01:22:19,584 --> 01:22:23,626
But we cannot let politics come
in the way of humanity.

847
01:22:24,001 --> 01:22:28,001
Make sure the Indian and the
Pakistani nurses are rescued.

848
01:22:28,293 --> 01:22:31,209
- I am with Tiger on this.
- Yes, sir.

849
01:22:50,501 --> 01:22:51,793
Open up!

850
01:23:18,834 --> 01:23:20,501
- Are we in?
- Not yet, Rakeshji.

851
01:23:35,126 --> 01:23:37,543
Make it happen this time,
Lord Hanuman!

852
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:44,418
Done! Let's go.

853
01:24:10,959 --> 01:24:13,459
I love American breakfast.

854
01:24:14,709 --> 01:24:17,293
Gary, why did you remember me?

855
01:24:17,876 --> 01:24:19,709
A few days ago, as I am sure
you are aware...

856
01:24:19,959 --> 01:24:21,543
...Abu Usman grabbed three
of our soldiers...

857
01:24:21,918 --> 01:24:24,084
...and two civilians, journalists.

858
01:24:26,376 --> 01:24:29,918
Journalists...? Or CIA agents?

859
01:24:31,918 --> 01:24:33,918
We need you to find out where
he's keeping them.

860
01:24:36,584 --> 01:24:37,709
This is for you.

861
01:24:40,084 --> 01:24:42,543
Don't think I'm going
to negotiate.

862
01:24:43,418 --> 01:24:44,501
Enough!

863
01:24:45,126 --> 01:24:48,209
This is my country, my deal!
Or no deal.

864
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:50,168
- Baghdawi?
- Understand?

865
01:24:51,001 --> 01:24:53,126
Baghdawi!
What is he doing here?

866
01:24:54,376 --> 01:24:56,543
He came to discuss a back end
oil deal.

867
01:24:57,793 --> 01:24:59,918
- You're doing terrorist...
- No, no.

868
01:25:00,418 --> 01:25:02,626
- He came as a businessman.
- And?

869
01:25:04,043 --> 01:25:06,751
- He asked for too much money.
- So, now?

870
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:09,834
So now he's leaving as a terrorist.

871
01:25:10,209 --> 01:25:11,501
What will you do?

872
01:25:13,626 --> 01:25:16,001
What do you think we do
to terrorists?

873
01:25:34,751 --> 01:25:35,751
Baghdawi!

874
01:25:37,043 --> 01:25:38,793
Baghdawi! Stop the car!

875
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:41,001
Stop the car!

876
01:25:41,251 --> 01:25:43,376
Stop right there! I'll shoot you.

877
01:25:43,876 --> 01:25:46,376
Don't shoot! I am a friend of Amir.

878
01:25:49,876 --> 01:25:51,043
Get me drones.

879
01:25:51,668 --> 01:25:52,834
All eyes on target.

880
01:25:53,084 --> 01:25:54,126
Stop, stop!

881
01:25:55,959 --> 01:25:58,126
Amir! Don't shoot!

882
01:25:59,543 --> 01:26:00,793
Don't move!

883
01:26:01,126 --> 01:26:02,501
America...blast!

884
01:26:02,793 --> 01:26:04,459
America. No oil deal.

885
01:26:06,501 --> 01:26:07,459
He's on the move, sir.

886
01:26:11,584 --> 01:26:12,876
Target. Lock.

887
01:26:13,459 --> 01:26:14,293
Engage.

888
01:26:36,709 --> 01:26:39,251
Thank you, Firdaus.

889
01:26:41,251 --> 01:26:42,376
Amir...

890
01:26:57,876 --> 01:26:58,918
Next.

891
01:27:11,709 --> 01:27:12,793
That banana is mine.

892
01:27:21,418 --> 01:27:23,501
- Who's got the anti-fire gel?
- I have it.

893
01:27:25,918 --> 01:27:28,334
How long before the CCTV
works again, Rakeshji?

894
01:27:28,668 --> 01:27:29,293
7 minutes.

895
01:27:29,584 --> 01:27:33,459
- The guards' next shift is in 5.
- That gives us 3 minutes.

896
01:27:33,793 --> 01:27:36,709
- Azaan, alert us. Call.
- Sure, sir.

897
01:27:37,334 --> 01:27:39,668
Let's go. Come on! Showtime.

898
01:27:58,126 --> 01:27:59,959
- What is it?
- Too much oil.

899
01:28:00,334 --> 01:28:02,251
I must drill. Drain the oil out.

900
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:20,001
Oh no, no!

901
01:28:23,751 --> 01:28:25,251
Pick up. Pick up, sir.

902
01:28:27,584 --> 01:28:28,293
Shit!

903
01:28:30,584 --> 01:28:32,584
Hey! What are you doing?

904
01:28:32,918 --> 01:28:34,501
I said what are you doing?

905
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:38,959
- Don't stop, Namit.
- What are you guys talking?

906
01:28:39,126 --> 01:28:40,376
We have <i>2</i> minutes.

907
01:28:40,668 --> 01:28:42,126
Sit down! Or I'll shoot you.

908
01:28:49,126 --> 01:28:50,584
To the second floor!

909
01:29:44,418 --> 01:29:46,918
Rakeshji, the guards are here.

910
01:29:47,209 --> 01:29:49,251
What? You're eating a banana?

911
01:29:53,001 --> 01:29:54,001
Namit, ready?

912
01:29:54,501 --> 01:29:55,293
Sir!

913
01:30:06,209 --> 01:30:07,584
What's going on?

914
01:30:15,126 --> 01:30:18,793
- Help me!
- Rakeshji, no need to overdo it.

915
01:30:19,543 --> 01:30:21,584
Second floor. Near the pipes.

916
01:30:31,251 --> 01:30:32,334
Hello.

917
01:30:34,876 --> 01:30:35,918
What?

918
01:30:37,043 --> 01:30:39,126
The dogs!

919
01:30:45,293 --> 01:30:47,376
Because of you my men die.

920
01:30:48,043 --> 01:30:49,501
You scumbags.

921
01:30:49,918 --> 01:30:51,918
You're misguided.

922
01:30:53,918 --> 01:30:55,043
I'll kill you.

923
01:30:55,376 --> 01:30:57,334
All of you swines.

924
01:30:58,876 --> 01:31:01,001
What have you done,
you morons?

925
01:31:01,334 --> 01:31:03,126
They're the morons, not us.

926
01:31:03,501 --> 01:31:06,876
They were smoking. I warned them
about the gas leak.

927
01:31:07,251 --> 01:31:09,709
They were killed in the explosion.
And we suffered burns.

928
01:31:10,084 --> 01:31:11,668
So you survived?

929
01:31:12,084 --> 01:31:14,376
You dumb fool, you think I am
an idiot?

930
01:31:14,626 --> 01:31:17,293
A bullet's coming your way.
Amir Baghdawi!

931
01:31:17,584 --> 01:31:18,793
Stop!

932
01:31:19,751 --> 01:31:20,584
Ok!

933
01:31:21,084 --> 01:31:23,126
Shoot the rascals!

934
01:31:24,793 --> 01:31:27,501
One minute...alone.
Talk.

935
01:31:28,251 --> 01:31:29,668
We talk.

936
01:31:30,959 --> 01:31:32,418
The mission's over.

937
01:31:32,709 --> 01:31:34,418
Firdaus is a fox.

938
01:31:34,959 --> 01:31:37,918
No, he's not a fox, he's fascinating.

939
01:31:38,293 --> 01:31:41,709
Labour, lot of money, Amir.
Expensive.

940
01:31:42,084 --> 01:31:44,584
One person, ten thousand dinars.

941
01:31:45,959 --> 01:31:48,209
- But my men died.
- Accident.

942
01:31:48,751 --> 01:31:50,168
Accidents happen.

943
01:31:50,501 --> 01:31:53,584
Twenty-five years I worked here,
accidents happen.

944
01:31:53,918 --> 01:31:55,293
I teach them a lesson.

945
01:31:55,584 --> 01:31:56,501
I cut them...

946
01:31:58,751 --> 01:32:02,459
You kill four... four hundred stop.

947
01:32:02,834 --> 01:32:04,126
No work. Strike.

948
01:32:04,501 --> 01:32:06,501
Labour very close army...

949
01:32:06,834 --> 01:32:09,876
...they no work, no refinery.

950
01:32:10,251 --> 01:32:12,876
No money. No oil. Loss.

951
01:32:16,793 --> 01:32:18,501
Think with a cool head.

952
01:32:34,709 --> 01:32:36,084
Take them to the hospital!

953
01:32:52,626 --> 01:32:56,751
Thanks to you guys, I was nearly
killed today.

954
01:32:57,543 --> 01:33:00,834
You think you've escaped
death's claws?

955
01:33:01,751 --> 01:33:06,334
I saved you from Baghdawi so that
I could shoot you myself.

956
01:33:06,918 --> 01:33:10,209
But first tell me, who are you?

957
01:33:11,709 --> 01:33:14,418
I know you're Indian agents.

958
01:33:15,126 --> 01:33:18,209
But I want to know what
you're doing here.

959
01:33:19,751 --> 01:33:21,376
Speak up! Or I'll shoot.

960
01:33:25,418 --> 01:33:26,459
God forbid!

961
01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:29,168
You missed from so close!
You scaring us?

962
01:33:29,626 --> 01:33:34,459
I'll open those ears of yours!
Me? Scaring you?

963
01:33:35,126 --> 01:33:39,418
Fasten your seat belts tight.
Sister-in-law is here!

964
01:33:48,668 --> 01:33:51,251
- Who's the shooter?
- Sister-in-law!

965
01:34:17,876 --> 01:34:19,751
Zoya, I was in that car too.

966
01:34:21,334 --> 01:34:23,876
- Dangerous sister-in-law.
- Right!

967
01:34:24,459 --> 01:34:26,626
- Sorry, sorry.
- Goodbye.

968
01:34:27,001 --> 01:34:28,626
"Tu tu tu tutu tara."

969
01:34:31,376 --> 01:34:34,251
"Tu tu tu tutu tara.
Our friend is here."

970
01:34:34,709 --> 01:34:35,959
You know the code?

971
01:34:36,334 --> 01:34:39,626
I've been RAW's agent in Iraq
for 25 years.

972
01:34:40,084 --> 01:34:42,251
My medals are in Saharanpur.

973
01:34:42,543 --> 01:34:46,209
I've slogged for RAW for years,
and you point a gun at my head?

974
01:34:46,626 --> 01:34:48,293
You show me no respect.

975
01:34:49,084 --> 01:34:51,334
- And Pawan?
- My junior.

976
01:34:51,876 --> 01:34:54,543
If you're RAW, why did you nearly
kill us?

977
01:34:54,793 --> 01:34:56,126
Shenoy said:

978
01:34:56,376 --> 01:35:00,126
"Before they get to the hospital,
scare the living daylights out of them.

979
01:35:00,376 --> 01:35:02,459
"If they break, better sooner
than later."

980
01:35:07,209 --> 01:35:08,793
Shenoy sir!

981
01:35:13,584 --> 01:35:15,709
Shenoy must've given you
a double code.

982
01:35:15,918 --> 01:35:19,584
A single code can only work once.

983
01:35:19,959 --> 01:35:21,459
The double code?

984
01:35:23,376 --> 01:35:24,543
What is it?

985
01:35:25,793 --> 01:35:26,918
Tell me!

986
01:35:27,876 --> 01:35:29,293
"Black lentils."

987
01:35:30,376 --> 01:35:33,959
No one cooks black lentils
better than Tiger.

988
01:35:40,084 --> 01:35:41,418
He's RAW.

989
01:35:44,959 --> 01:35:47,459
Brother, is that Abrar?

990
01:35:47,918 --> 01:35:50,418
The ISI captain? What's going on?

991
01:35:50,751 --> 01:35:53,168
RAW and ISI? Together?

992
01:35:55,751 --> 01:35:57,376
Does the PM know?

993
01:36:06,126 --> 01:36:08,876
Abrar and Javed have joined
the ISC guys...

994
01:36:09,626 --> 01:36:11,334
...their IDs will get them
into the hospital.

995
01:36:11,918 --> 01:36:13,918
Pawan said there were only 25 guards.

996
01:36:14,293 --> 01:36:16,834
We have three days
to get the nurses out.

997
01:36:17,126 --> 01:36:21,251
The most important thing...
the hospital floor plan.

998
01:36:21,959 --> 01:36:23,626
It's in the City Council building.

999
01:36:23,918 --> 01:36:26,793
Zoya, you'll find a way
to bring it to us.

1000
01:36:28,626 --> 01:36:30,251
Our mission starts now.

1001
01:36:34,501 --> 01:36:35,668
Firdaus...

1002
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,251
Let's do this!

1003
01:36:45,501 --> 01:36:47,293
Take care of yourself.

1004
01:37:22,959 --> 01:37:25,668
Isn't the security too tight?

1005
01:37:26,918 --> 01:37:28,001
Something's wrong.

1006
01:37:28,293 --> 01:37:29,168
Stop!

1007
01:37:37,168 --> 01:37:37,918
ID?

1008
01:37:38,709 --> 01:37:41,043
- M?
- Me! ID.

1009
01:37:41,418 --> 01:37:43,834
Baghdawi refinery accident.

1010
01:37:44,959 --> 01:37:46,876
Burn victims. Hospital.

1011
01:37:47,376 --> 01:37:48,168
Ok.

1012
01:37:51,084 --> 01:37:54,251
Why so many people here?

1013
01:38:02,084 --> 01:38:03,043
Well?

1014
01:38:03,501 --> 01:38:07,584
Didn't you check your horoscope
before this mission?

1015
01:38:10,043 --> 01:38:12,043
All your planets are haywire.

1016
01:38:14,043 --> 01:38:17,793
Last night the Americans bombed Mosul.

1017
01:38:19,918 --> 01:38:23,043
So Abu Usman has made this hospital
his base.

1018
01:38:25,293 --> 01:38:29,959
This hospital is now lSC's biggest
base in lkrit.

1019
01:38:32,668 --> 01:38:34,459
Now get the nurses out!

1020
01:39:12,668 --> 01:39:14,834
- 300 guards?
- Correct, sir.

1021
01:39:15,293 --> 01:39:18,293
Firdaus says the hospital is
Abu Usman's main base.

1022
01:39:18,709 --> 01:39:22,751
Using the nurses as a decoy,
Abu Usman is planning a major attack.

1023
01:39:24,543 --> 01:39:27,126
Do you have a back-up plan?

1024
01:39:28,209 --> 01:39:29,001
War.

1025
01:39:30,084 --> 01:39:32,668
- Are you sure, Shenoy?
- Yes, sir.

1026
01:39:33,084 --> 01:39:36,834
Military intelligence says we must
talk to Iran.

1027
01:39:37,293 --> 01:39:41,001
We need helicopters, naval ships
in the Arabian Gulf...

1028
01:39:41,293 --> 01:39:44,543
...and Air Force support ready.

1029
01:39:45,626 --> 01:39:46,376
Karan...

1030
01:39:46,918 --> 01:39:49,501
Go to Iraq. Immediately.

1031
01:39:50,334 --> 01:39:52,376
I need someone I can trust there.

1032
01:39:53,168 --> 01:39:55,001
"The Prime Minister has finally
ordered...

1033
01:39:55,251 --> 01:39:57,668
"...lNS Mysore, a guided missile
destroyer...

1034
01:39:57,959 --> 01:40:01,668
"...and INS Tarkash to be dispatched
to the Arabian Gulf...

1035
01:40:02,084 --> 01:40:04,376
"...to bring home the trapped
nurses."

1036
01:40:45,209 --> 01:40:46,751
Take them in!

1037
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:51,918
Move them. Hurry!

1038
01:41:28,876 --> 01:41:30,626
Do you speak Arabic?

1039
01:41:38,501 --> 01:41:39,751
English?

1040
01:41:44,543 --> 01:41:45,376
Urdu?

1041
01:41:47,626 --> 01:41:48,793
Farsi?

1042
01:41:52,251 --> 01:41:53,709
What do you want?

1043
01:41:54,084 --> 01:41:56,334
I must get into the City Council
building.

1044
01:41:56,793 --> 01:41:58,084
It's urgent.

1045
01:41:58,459 --> 01:42:00,918
You don't know what goes on there.

1046
01:42:02,543 --> 01:42:05,501
My village is in Afghanistan
on the Pakistan border.

1047
01:42:06,084 --> 01:42:08,543
I came here to study
at the medical college.

1048
01:42:09,251 --> 01:42:11,793
Some of the girls and I
were abducted...

1049
01:42:12,418 --> 01:42:13,543
...from the college.

1050
01:42:13,876 --> 01:42:16,751
They said that girls
should not be studying.

1051
01:42:17,751 --> 01:42:20,126
They took us to the
City Council building.

1052
01:42:21,084 --> 01:42:23,251
We had to mop the floors.

1053
01:42:24,293 --> 01:42:26,251
Baghdawi and his men showed up.

1054
01:42:26,959 --> 01:42:28,626
They beat us.

1055
01:42:30,376 --> 01:42:32,126
They raped us.

1056
01:42:33,418 --> 01:42:36,709
Any girl who tried to escape
was shot.

1057
01:42:38,168 --> 01:42:40,584
We are forced to go there
every day.

1058
01:42:42,293 --> 01:42:45,168
We have to scrub the floors.

1059
01:42:47,293 --> 01:42:50,126
On those same floors, they...

1060
01:43:40,543 --> 01:43:43,793
- How were you burned?
- A fire in the refinery.

1061
01:43:44,168 --> 01:43:45,251
That's how.

1062
01:43:45,501 --> 01:43:47,459
Did you light that fire?

1063
01:43:48,501 --> 01:43:51,043
You have anti-fire gel on your skin.

1064
01:43:51,376 --> 01:43:54,293
We're RAW agents. We're here to
get you out.

1065
01:43:54,834 --> 01:43:58,043
This is my team. Don't show
any reaction.

1066
01:43:58,501 --> 01:43:59,501
Keep listening.

1067
01:43:59,959 --> 01:44:03,209
If we don't get you out in <i>2</i> days...

1068
01:44:03,626 --> 01:44:06,418
...the Americans will start bombing.
Then we're all dead.

1069
01:44:06,834 --> 01:44:09,459
We were told there are
4O nurses here.

1070
01:44:09,709 --> 01:44:10,543
39.

1071
01:44:11,543 --> 01:44:14,209
A Pakistani nurse was shot
<i>2</i> days ago.

1072
01:44:15,001 --> 01:44:17,584
Escaping is impossible.

1073
01:44:19,001 --> 01:44:22,043
They're animals, not men.
And Abu Usman...

1074
01:44:33,334 --> 01:44:34,584
...is everywhere.

1075
01:44:37,251 --> 01:44:38,459
Here he comes.

1076
01:44:53,084 --> 01:44:55,376
Will you change my dressing, Poorna?

1077
01:44:58,751 --> 01:45:01,418
- Are you an Indian?
- Yes.

1078
01:45:03,584 --> 01:45:06,293
You must be happy today,
Miss Poorna.

1079
01:45:08,209 --> 01:45:13,043
Nice meeting someone in a foreign land
from back home.

1080
01:45:15,084 --> 01:45:17,959
- Your name?
- Manish Chandra.

1081
01:45:18,376 --> 01:45:19,834
Manish?

1082
01:45:20,709 --> 01:45:24,668
- You have a very nice face, Manish.
- Thank you.

1083
01:45:24,959 --> 01:45:26,709
Especially your eyes.

1084
01:45:27,709 --> 01:45:28,543
Very sharp.

1085
01:45:30,293 --> 01:45:31,543
Like a tiger.

1086
01:45:32,001 --> 01:45:34,918
What a coincidence! That's what
my Dad says.

1087
01:45:36,251 --> 01:45:38,418
Only 4 of you?

1088
01:45:40,334 --> 01:45:42,334
Yes. Just 4.

1089
01:45:42,876 --> 01:45:44,126
And the others?

1090
01:45:44,959 --> 01:45:47,001
- Are you from the Baghdawi refinery?
- Yes.

1091
01:45:48,626 --> 01:45:50,793
Your government is doing nothing.

1092
01:45:51,668 --> 01:45:56,168
They're not saving the many Indians
trapped here in Iraq.

1093
01:45:58,084 --> 01:46:00,418
Amir, we're ready to leave.

1094
01:46:00,834 --> 01:46:03,876
Poorna, how long before he's well?

1095
01:46:05,418 --> 01:46:06,876
Two days at least.

1096
01:46:07,584 --> 01:46:10,293
- Be our guest for these two days.
- Thank you.

1097
01:46:28,834 --> 01:46:31,709
The world that swears by
Your existence...

1098
01:46:34,209 --> 01:46:36,793
...is a volcano of hatred today.

1099
01:46:39,501 --> 01:46:43,918
Values are long forgotten.
Self-interest rules the world.

1100
01:46:50,293 --> 01:46:51,793
All principles...

1101
01:46:52,668 --> 01:46:55,543
...and all knowledge forgotten.

1102
01:46:57,793 --> 01:47:01,334
All flowers have turned to dust.

1103
01:47:04,834 --> 01:47:07,209
Baghdawi is here!
Go and get ready.

1104
01:47:07,918 --> 01:47:09,418
Get up, move!

1105
01:47:16,876 --> 01:47:18,751
The world that swears by
Your existence...

1106
01:47:22,418 --> 01:47:24,834
...is a volcano of hatred today.

1107
01:47:25,543 --> 01:47:27,251
Go. get ready!

1108
01:47:27,751 --> 01:47:32,168
Values are long forgotten.
Self-interest rules the world.

1109
01:47:42,793 --> 01:47:44,501
All principles...

1110
01:47:44,959 --> 01:47:46,084
Lift your veils!

1111
01:47:46,376 --> 01:47:49,126
...and all knowledge forgotten.

1112
01:47:51,209 --> 01:47:54,293
All flowers have turned to dust.

1113
01:47:59,751 --> 01:48:02,209
I am of little significance.

1114
01:48:02,501 --> 01:48:04,834
I have no standing.

1115
01:48:05,251 --> 01:48:08,751
You are my glory.
You are my pride.

1116
01:48:09,126 --> 01:48:10,126
You're new?

1117
01:48:13,959 --> 01:48:14,918
Take off your clothes.

1118
01:48:15,168 --> 01:48:17,168
Why has Your Divine light
deserted us?

1119
01:48:21,126 --> 01:48:23,418
My soul only chants
Your name.

1120
01:48:33,293 --> 01:48:34,543
Amir Baghdawi.

1121
01:48:56,209 --> 01:48:57,793
Without love...

1122
01:48:59,501 --> 01:49:02,043
...there is no freedom.

1123
01:49:04,293 --> 01:49:06,584
No one understands...

1124
01:49:14,793 --> 01:49:16,959
...that we are being misled...

1125
01:49:22,793 --> 01:49:24,459
...by those in power.

1126
01:49:30,543 --> 01:49:35,126
Our voices are silenced,
circumstances are against us.

1127
01:49:35,793 --> 01:49:39,709
Yet we will fight on.
Long live the revolution!

1128
01:50:03,584 --> 01:50:04,918
Move, move!

1129
01:50:07,209 --> 01:50:08,293
Spread out.

1130
01:50:16,293 --> 01:50:17,793
Powerful Ali, help us.

1131
01:50:52,126 --> 01:50:53,293
Find her!

1132
01:51:18,209 --> 01:51:19,501
Amazing, Tiger!

1133
01:51:20,168 --> 01:51:22,751
Zoya has created havoc
and you're smiling?

1134
01:51:23,168 --> 01:51:25,376
She's been caught on CCTV.

1135
01:51:25,918 --> 01:51:28,543
How does she look?
Looks good?

1136
01:51:29,084 --> 01:51:31,043
What are you playing at?

1137
01:51:31,418 --> 01:51:34,543
Take Zoya to your American friends
and tell them...

1138
01:51:34,834 --> 01:51:39,501
...to set off an explosion at the ISC
check post at 12 tomorrow.

1139
01:51:46,084 --> 01:51:49,626
Is food poisoning treated with pills
or injections?

1140
01:51:49,876 --> 01:51:51,959
An injection, if it's a serious case.

1141
01:51:52,168 --> 01:51:54,959
- Does it make them drowsy?
- No.

1142
01:51:55,251 --> 01:51:57,918
We usually sedate patients
before surgery.

1143
01:51:58,209 --> 01:52:01,543
- They sleep for hours.
- How's the supply of sedatives?

1144
01:52:01,834 --> 01:52:03,543
We'll just check that, sir.

1145
01:52:05,959 --> 01:52:06,793
Perfect!

1146
01:52:07,209 --> 01:52:08,584
What's the plan?

1147
01:52:09,084 --> 01:52:11,168
Someone is up to something.

1148
01:52:11,918 --> 01:52:14,209
Get Baghdawi's body to the hospital.

1149
01:52:14,959 --> 01:52:16,543
Gather all the guards.

1150
01:52:19,668 --> 01:52:21,168
Time has come.

1151
01:52:24,751 --> 01:52:26,501
Prepare for the war.

1152
01:52:38,376 --> 01:52:39,793
Open the door. Get down!

1153
01:52:40,418 --> 01:52:41,459
Out!

1154
01:53:00,126 --> 01:53:02,626
India, Pakistan,
son of one mother.

1155
01:53:02,876 --> 01:53:04,043
One motherland!

1156
01:53:05,459 --> 01:53:07,584
You tell me. Yes, or no?

1157
01:53:15,459 --> 01:53:16,918
Move fast!

1158
01:53:55,168 --> 01:53:57,376
Brothers and my soldiers!

1159
01:53:58,793 --> 01:54:01,543
Baghdawi and his men...

1160
01:54:02,584 --> 01:54:04,834
...sacrificed their lives for us.

1161
01:54:05,418 --> 01:54:07,376
Their death won't go in vain.

1162
01:54:07,959 --> 01:54:11,418
Every single person among us
will avenge their death.

1163
01:54:12,376 --> 01:54:14,126
It is not easy to break us.

1164
01:54:14,501 --> 01:54:18,126
To destroy our thoughts,
beliefs and our army.

1165
01:54:19,834 --> 01:54:23,293
Time for revolution. To show
the world our power...

1166
01:54:24,168 --> 01:54:25,626
Sir, the sedatives.

1167
01:54:30,251 --> 01:54:32,626
- Call everyone for the speech.
- Ok, copy.

1168
01:54:33,668 --> 01:54:36,001
Hurry! The speech has started.

1169
01:54:36,334 --> 01:54:38,918
We won't let anyone do what
they want on our land...

1170
01:54:39,209 --> 01:54:40,668
...for their own benefit.

1171
01:54:41,334 --> 01:54:42,251
How are you?

1172
01:54:42,709 --> 01:54:44,126
They bomb our cities.

1173
01:54:44,543 --> 01:54:46,043
They kill our families...

1174
01:54:46,543 --> 01:54:49,584
...our fathers, mothers, brothers
and sisters...

1175
01:54:49,959 --> 01:54:51,251
...and they call us terrorists.

1176
01:54:51,876 --> 01:54:55,001
I've checked, sir. We have
150 sedative injections.

1177
01:54:55,376 --> 01:54:58,584
Hurry, switch the labels.
Namit, help them.

1178
01:55:10,168 --> 01:55:12,584
You have to decide who's the victim.

1179
01:55:13,376 --> 01:55:15,001
Us? Or them?

1180
01:55:16,001 --> 01:55:16,876
Make sure...

1181
01:55:17,084 --> 01:55:20,626
...the labels read food poisoning
medication.

1182
01:55:27,126 --> 01:55:28,168
Lighter?

1183
01:55:30,876 --> 01:55:31,959
Thank you.

1184
01:55:42,209 --> 01:55:43,709
Ready to die?

1185
01:55:45,043 --> 01:55:46,584
Are you ready to die?

1186
01:55:48,709 --> 01:55:50,043
Victory is ours!

1187
01:55:53,709 --> 01:55:55,126
Victory is ours!

1188
01:56:10,584 --> 01:56:14,168
Rakeshji, are you sure
you mixed in the powder?

1189
01:56:14,543 --> 01:56:16,376
They look fine.

1190
01:56:17,709 --> 01:56:20,334
I mixed phenol pills
with ammonia.

1191
01:56:20,668 --> 01:56:23,834
Just wait. Their bellies will soon
be on fire.

1192
01:56:26,584 --> 01:56:27,793
Azaan...

1193
01:56:29,168 --> 01:56:30,459
...what are you looking for?

1194
01:56:31,001 --> 01:56:34,084
Once the nurses are freed,
where to hoist our flag?

1195
01:56:34,376 --> 01:56:35,293
What?

1196
01:56:35,668 --> 01:56:38,793
- You brought your flag too?
- Who else has a flag?

1197
01:56:48,293 --> 01:56:52,168
Emotions evidently run high
on both sides of the border.

1198
01:56:59,918 --> 01:57:00,959
What's wrong?

1199
01:57:04,084 --> 01:57:06,626
See that? They're dropping
like flies.

1200
01:57:19,709 --> 01:57:22,459
- How many men are down?
- Nearly half, sir.

1201
01:57:28,626 --> 01:57:29,918
How bad is he?

1202
01:57:30,251 --> 01:57:32,084
An extreme case of food poisoning.

1203
01:57:32,626 --> 01:57:35,251
We've given him glucose.
But he can't hold anything down.

1204
01:57:35,584 --> 01:57:40,293
We must give him an injection,
a heavy dose. It will work.

1205
01:57:52,376 --> 01:57:53,334
Stop!

1206
01:57:58,834 --> 01:58:00,418
Get those four Indians.

1207
01:58:13,459 --> 01:58:14,793
Not that one.

1208
01:58:18,668 --> 01:58:19,626
Here.

1209
01:58:32,501 --> 01:58:33,668
Not him.

1210
01:58:39,501 --> 01:58:40,626
Inject him.

1211
01:59:33,334 --> 01:59:36,126
Give the injection
to all the sick men.

1212
02:00:15,668 --> 02:00:16,751
Go!

1213
02:00:33,626 --> 02:00:35,334
What did you do to the food?

1214
02:00:36,376 --> 02:00:38,126
Tell me who poisoned the food!

1215
02:00:46,043 --> 02:00:47,668
Northern check post.

1216
02:00:49,293 --> 02:00:51,918
- Go again!
- Northern check post is hit.

1217
02:00:52,209 --> 02:00:53,834
We're hit.

1218
02:00:54,959 --> 02:00:56,918
There's been an attack
at the northern check post.

1219
02:01:27,834 --> 02:01:29,418
Sir, we've given them
the sedatives.

1220
02:01:29,668 --> 02:01:31,501
The guards won't wake up
for 3 hours.

1221
02:01:33,626 --> 02:01:34,834
Nor will Azaan.

1222
02:01:36,459 --> 02:01:40,918
As planned, half the men are down.
The other half is with Abu Usman.

1223
02:01:41,501 --> 02:01:42,709
No time to waste...

1224
02:01:44,626 --> 02:01:45,668
...let's go.

1225
02:01:48,168 --> 02:01:49,959
Post disarmed.

1226
02:01:50,209 --> 02:01:52,793
Hi, guys. Our job's done.
Now get out of there.

1227
02:01:53,126 --> 02:01:54,918
Copy that. Move out now.

1228
02:01:59,168 --> 02:02:00,584
Move out now!

1229
02:02:01,126 --> 02:02:02,834
Move! Move! Let's go.

1230
02:02:03,168 --> 02:02:05,751
- Let's give it a few minutes.
- We got our orders.

1231
02:02:11,043 --> 02:02:13,043
The shooting has stopped.

1232
02:02:13,501 --> 02:02:14,876
Copy. Amir.

1233
02:02:15,209 --> 02:02:17,918
The shooting at the check post
has suddenly stopped.

1234
02:02:20,709 --> 02:02:21,959
It's a decoy.

1235
02:03:18,084 --> 02:03:19,751
Thanks be to God.

1236
02:03:26,626 --> 02:03:27,876
Hold fire!

1237
02:03:36,001 --> 02:03:38,834
I can see someone
on the second floor.

1238
02:05:23,918 --> 02:05:25,876
She's a strong woman.

1239
02:05:26,668 --> 02:05:29,584
My guards tell me it took a while
restraining her.

1240
02:05:31,043 --> 02:05:33,751
And what she did to Baghdawi.

1241
02:05:34,084 --> 02:05:37,376
- She has shaken the Caliphate.
- Usman!

1242
02:05:37,959 --> 02:05:42,334
If you touch her again,
I'll bury you alive right here.

1243
02:05:46,584 --> 02:05:47,709
Tiger...

1244
02:05:48,668 --> 02:05:50,084
...isn't that your name?

1245
02:05:51,959 --> 02:05:55,918
You managed to do what both
your countries could not do.

1246
02:05:56,501 --> 02:06:00,334
Getting India and Pakistan
working on a mission together.

1247
02:06:01,876 --> 02:06:04,293
You must be a very
charismatic man, Tiger.

1248
02:06:04,584 --> 02:06:07,376
And what are you? A hero?

1249
02:06:08,168 --> 02:06:11,251
Waging war on the pretext
of religion.

1250
02:06:11,793 --> 02:06:15,293
What do you think? This war
is about religion?

1251
02:06:15,959 --> 02:06:19,584
Do you get your information
from the western media?

1252
02:06:21,918 --> 02:06:25,709
Where do these bombs, weapons
and money come from?

1253
02:06:26,126 --> 02:06:27,918
Who provides them to us?

1254
02:06:29,084 --> 02:06:31,376
This war is business.

1255
02:06:31,709 --> 02:06:33,459
The whole world's in it.

1256
02:06:34,251 --> 02:06:36,376
We're the ones seen
on ground zero.

1257
02:06:37,001 --> 02:06:39,668
But the whole world is profiting.

1258
02:06:40,876 --> 02:06:44,793
To control this business,
you need power.

1259
02:06:45,251 --> 02:06:48,751
And the one who is powerful
controls fear.

1260
02:06:50,709 --> 02:06:51,751
Today...

1261
02:06:52,251 --> 02:06:54,251
...when you're with your family...

1262
02:06:54,668 --> 02:06:58,251
...on the beach or in a mall,
or taking a flight...

1263
02:06:59,918 --> 02:07:02,793
...don't you fear
a suicide bomber?

1264
02:07:05,626 --> 02:07:08,918
This widespread terror
in the world today...

1265
02:07:09,334 --> 02:07:11,418
...that is our strength, Tiger.

1266
02:07:11,751 --> 02:07:15,834
So you strap a bomb on Hassan, a kid,
and stand him in a crowd.

1267
02:07:16,209 --> 02:07:20,001
For your own interests you brainwash
innocents with hate speeches.

1268
02:07:20,543 --> 02:07:22,459
<i>Is</i> that your business investment?

1269
02:07:24,043 --> 02:07:26,584
The genesis of this world
began with humanity.

1270
02:07:26,876 --> 02:07:29,459
Today the world needs only
one religion...

1271
02:07:29,834 --> 02:07:31,876
...and that is humanity.

1272
02:07:32,209 --> 02:07:33,668
I know, Tiger.

1273
02:07:34,043 --> 02:07:36,459
Your philosophy only works in theory.

1274
02:07:37,626 --> 02:07:40,709
We've followed your plan till now.

1275
02:07:41,209 --> 02:07:42,709
Now listen to mine.

1276
02:07:43,959 --> 02:07:47,543
The Americans will bomb
this hospital shortly.

1277
02:07:48,251 --> 02:07:49,418
And you...

1278
02:07:49,793 --> 02:07:50,959
...your team...

1279
02:07:51,209 --> 02:07:53,084
...and these nurses - all dead.

1280
02:07:53,626 --> 02:07:55,959
The Americans will think
they killed me.

1281
02:07:56,709 --> 02:08:00,376
The whole world will celebrate
for a few hours.

1282
02:08:00,876 --> 02:08:03,959
"The most wanted man on the planet
is dead."

1283
02:08:05,793 --> 02:08:08,126
And after that...

1284
02:08:08,876 --> 02:08:10,709
...a video will be released.

1285
02:08:11,001 --> 02:08:15,459
Showing me executing thirty foreigners
en masse.

1286
02:08:16,251 --> 02:08:19,043
That will be my revenge, Tiger.

1287
02:08:30,459 --> 02:08:31,751
Take a good look.

1288
02:08:35,793 --> 02:08:38,793
The minute you inhale the gas...

1289
02:08:40,376 --> 02:08:43,376
...all your past happy years
with her...

1290
02:08:43,959 --> 02:08:48,293
...will flash before your eyes
for an instant.

1291
02:08:52,001 --> 02:08:53,126
Ryan, take her.

1292
02:09:03,126 --> 02:09:07,668
Tiger, if you have the guts,
stop me.

1293
02:09:11,918 --> 02:09:12,876
Usman...

1294
02:09:13,418 --> 02:09:15,126
...if you have the guts...

1295
02:09:15,543 --> 02:09:16,793
...then...

1296
02:09:18,418 --> 02:09:19,793
...you stop me.

1297
02:09:24,543 --> 02:09:27,293
Bring our nurses home!

1298
02:09:28,793 --> 02:09:30,584
- Adam.
- 30 minutes.

1299
02:09:31,751 --> 02:09:33,251
I need more time, Adam.

1300
02:09:33,501 --> 02:09:35,209
30 minutes. That's all you got,
Shenoy.

1301
02:09:35,418 --> 02:09:37,626
I'm sorry, we have our orders.
We're moving in.

1302
02:09:56,418 --> 02:09:57,293
Bad news.

1303
02:09:57,668 --> 02:09:59,084
Tiger was caught.

1304
02:10:01,459 --> 02:10:02,168
Yes, sir?

1305
02:10:02,501 --> 02:10:04,459
We have only thirty minutes.

1306
02:10:04,668 --> 02:10:05,876
30 minutes?

1307
02:10:06,209 --> 02:10:07,084
Yes.

1308
02:10:08,043 --> 02:10:09,334
That's it.

1309
02:10:10,793 --> 02:10:13,209
- What 30 minutes?
- The American air strike starts.

1310
02:10:13,459 --> 02:10:16,501
30 minutes? Must we oil our scalps
in the meantime?

1311
02:10:16,834 --> 02:10:18,376
Are they crazy?

1312
02:10:21,334 --> 02:10:22,209
Oil!

1313
02:10:24,293 --> 02:10:25,126
Oil!

1314
02:10:27,876 --> 02:10:28,793
Let's go.

1315
02:12:05,084 --> 02:12:06,334
Long live Lord Hanuman!

1316
02:12:09,209 --> 02:12:11,168
Your blood pressure ok?

1317
02:12:11,501 --> 02:12:14,918
I thought the Lord of Death
had brushed past me today.

1318
02:12:29,793 --> 02:12:30,918
Amir.

1319
02:12:32,793 --> 02:12:34,251
Tiger is alive.

1320
02:12:34,918 --> 02:12:37,668
I won't leave this hospital...

1321
02:12:38,168 --> 02:12:39,959
...till I see his dead body.

1322
02:12:41,543 --> 02:12:42,501
Go!

1323
02:13:03,501 --> 02:13:04,793
Grab it all!

1324
02:14:19,043 --> 02:14:22,626
All the bombs are connected to
her vest. They could explode.

1325
02:14:22,876 --> 02:14:25,084
Shut up, Namit!
You have 4 minutes.

1326
02:14:25,293 --> 02:14:27,751
Sir, this is what I do.
This is impossible.

1327
02:14:28,001 --> 02:14:28,876
Please sir.

1328
02:14:29,209 --> 02:14:31,209
They can't all die because of me.

1329
02:14:31,584 --> 02:14:32,418
Come here.

1330
02:14:33,751 --> 02:14:35,168
I won't hear a "no."

1331
02:14:35,418 --> 02:14:37,084
Please understand. This is
not possible.

1332
02:14:39,709 --> 02:14:40,709
Look at them.

1333
02:14:42,959 --> 02:14:46,626
It's our mission to take them all
home alive.

1334
02:14:47,584 --> 02:14:48,668
Namit...

1335
02:14:49,709 --> 02:14:52,751
Responsibility is entrusted
by God to a very few.

1336
02:14:53,293 --> 02:14:55,459
Only the lucky are so blessed.

1337
02:14:56,709 --> 02:14:58,251
Don't let yourself down, man.

1338
02:15:01,084 --> 02:15:03,543
If I come, I come with Poorna.

1339
02:15:04,834 --> 02:15:07,418
If not, I salute you.
Sat Sri Akal.

1340
02:15:09,918 --> 02:15:11,793
She'll be fine. Let's go.

1341
02:15:14,334 --> 02:15:17,418
Move into the left gate. And you,
move into the right gate. Now!

1342
02:15:18,834 --> 02:15:21,709
Just do me a favour. Don't look down.
Look at me.

1343
02:15:22,876 --> 02:15:24,418
Keep looking at me, Poorna.

1344
02:15:25,793 --> 02:15:26,751
Just...

1345
02:15:28,459 --> 02:15:30,168
...tell my mother...

1346
02:15:31,876 --> 02:15:33,001
...I didn't give up.

1347
02:15:34,376 --> 02:15:36,043
Didn't stop trying.

1348
02:15:38,751 --> 02:15:39,876
I didn't give up.

1349
02:15:40,876 --> 02:15:43,251
Tell my father...

1350
02:15:46,043 --> 02:15:47,584
I really loved him.

1351
02:15:51,209 --> 02:15:53,126
Azaan, in the middle.
Abrar, at the back.

1352
02:15:53,918 --> 02:15:55,293
Black?

1353
02:15:58,126 --> 02:16:00,168
No, red.

1354
02:16:03,293 --> 02:16:04,126
Red!

1355
02:16:11,543 --> 02:16:12,459
What is it?

1356
02:16:12,793 --> 02:16:15,959
No red wire in the last circuit.
We must praise open the vest.

1357
02:16:19,418 --> 02:16:21,084
Fifteen minutes to strike!

1358
02:16:21,501 --> 02:16:23,001
Let's get drones up and ready.

1359
02:17:05,501 --> 02:17:06,418
Jiya, my friend.

1360
02:17:08,293 --> 02:17:09,334
Sat Sri Akal!

1361
02:17:15,376 --> 02:17:18,376
- Anyone following?
- Not a soul. Step on it!

1362
02:17:22,834 --> 02:17:24,668
Bravo, Rakeshji.
Right on time.

1363
02:17:30,209 --> 02:17:32,168
Everyone out of here.
Let's go. Now!

1364
02:17:54,543 --> 02:17:56,001
Long live Lord Hanuman!

1365
02:17:57,084 --> 02:17:58,751
Everyone, take position.

1366
02:18:23,876 --> 02:18:25,251
The whole army is here.

1367
02:18:25,793 --> 02:18:26,959
Don't worry.

1368
02:18:27,793 --> 02:18:29,084
Tiger is alive.

1369
02:20:22,418 --> 02:20:23,834
Sir, too many guards about.

1370
02:20:25,543 --> 02:20:27,918
- Any ammunition?
- A few rounds, sir.

1371
02:20:31,834 --> 02:20:33,626
Azaan, my magazine is empty.

1372
02:20:33,876 --> 02:20:36,293
Abrar, go. I'll cover you.

1373
02:20:36,501 --> 02:20:37,376
NOW!

1374
02:20:44,126 --> 02:20:45,168
Azaan, you ok?

1375
02:20:45,959 --> 02:20:47,834
I'm ok. Stay down!

1376
02:20:50,376 --> 02:20:52,293
The others need you. Go.

1377
02:20:52,543 --> 02:20:54,834
No, Azaan. Come with me.
Come!

1378
02:20:55,209 --> 02:20:56,876
One of us must stay here.
Go!

1379
02:20:57,293 --> 02:20:59,543
- Rakeshji...
- I haven't fired a single bullet.

1380
02:20:59,876 --> 02:21:01,709
Switch guns. Take the nurses in.

1381
02:21:01,959 --> 02:21:03,459
Move it! Let's go.

1382
02:21:05,501 --> 02:21:06,418
Take this.

1383
02:21:15,584 --> 02:21:16,459
Just...

1384
02:21:17,834 --> 02:21:18,668
<i>“QM!</i>

1385
02:21:46,584 --> 02:21:47,751
Where's Azaan?

1386
02:22:01,334 --> 02:22:02,209
Move!

1387
02:22:05,418 --> 02:22:06,459
Ready?

1388
02:23:22,209 --> 02:23:24,918
Karan, Firdaus. Get the nurses out.

1389
02:23:25,209 --> 02:23:27,918
The way out is blocked.
ISC have orders...

1390
02:23:28,168 --> 02:23:31,501
...until Abu Usman leaves,
no one else does.

1391
02:23:31,834 --> 02:23:34,376
- How much time have we got?
- Ten minutes.

1392
02:23:34,751 --> 02:23:37,584
Firdaus. Namit. Take care
of the nurses.

1393
02:23:37,959 --> 02:23:39,168
Come with me.

1394
02:24:06,459 --> 02:24:07,418
Get it?

1395
02:24:08,043 --> 02:24:09,334
Take care of it.

1396
02:25:19,793 --> 02:25:21,668
You're unstoppable, Tiger.

1397
02:25:22,459 --> 02:25:23,584
Amazing!

1398
02:25:28,543 --> 02:25:30,084
Now she must die.

1399
02:26:23,501 --> 02:26:25,626
Know why RAW calls me "Tiger?"

1400
02:26:26,126 --> 02:26:29,376
Because nothing is more dangerous
than a wounded tiger.

1401
02:26:31,209 --> 02:26:34,043
You didn't get it?
The tables have turned.

1402
02:26:34,751 --> 02:26:38,126
God will decide if He forgives you
or not.

1403
02:26:38,501 --> 02:26:41,834
My job is to send you to Him.

1404
02:26:42,918 --> 02:26:46,376
The nurses are going to leave
with my team.

1405
02:26:46,751 --> 02:26:48,043
All the hostages too.

1406
02:26:48,543 --> 02:26:50,626
Who will free them? You will.

1407
02:26:51,168 --> 02:26:53,001
Tomorrow's headlines will read:

1408
02:26:53,918 --> 02:26:58,334
"The most wanted man on planet earth
is dead."

1409
02:26:58,584 --> 02:26:59,626
Firdaus!

1410
02:26:59,959 --> 02:27:02,418
Take him away. He'll be dead
in 5 minutes.

1411
02:27:02,793 --> 02:27:04,626
The air strike will start.
Let's go.

1412
02:27:05,043 --> 02:27:06,543
Not without Zoya.

1413
02:27:07,084 --> 02:27:09,209
- It's suicide, sir.
- Trust me.

1414
02:27:10,168 --> 02:27:10,876
Leave!

1415
02:27:13,251 --> 02:27:14,584
One minute to strike.

1416
02:27:18,751 --> 02:27:20,084
Prime Minister on the line.

1417
02:27:33,918 --> 02:27:35,584
Stop, stop the car!

1418
02:27:39,876 --> 02:27:41,251
No gun. No.

1419
02:27:41,459 --> 02:27:43,709
Amir, Amir hurt. Open, fast.

1420
02:27:44,043 --> 02:27:45,543
Amir? Amir, are you ok?

1421
02:27:46,626 --> 02:27:48,293
Talk to me. Are you ok?

1422
02:27:48,584 --> 02:27:50,084
What's in the bus?

1423
02:27:50,334 --> 02:27:51,501
American hostages.

1424
02:27:51,709 --> 02:27:54,043
Amir's plan is to execute them.

1425
02:27:54,459 --> 02:27:56,334
Go, go! Check the bus.

1426
02:27:57,376 --> 02:27:59,751
Amir, are you ok? Talk to me.
Are you ok?

1427
02:28:16,959 --> 02:28:18,834
He's right. There are hostages
in the bus.

1428
02:28:19,959 --> 02:28:20,751
Please!

1429
02:28:21,001 --> 02:28:22,584
Ok. Go!

1430
02:28:22,918 --> 02:28:24,001
Thank you.

1431
02:28:32,293 --> 02:28:35,168
Target in sight, sir.
Ten seconds till strike.

1432
02:28:41,084 --> 02:28:43,543
Tiger, just leave me and go.

1433
02:28:45,543 --> 02:28:47,543
One of us must live.

1434
02:28:48,834 --> 02:28:49,793
For Junior.

1435
02:28:50,293 --> 02:28:51,043
Three...

1436
02:28:51,543 --> 02:28:53,126
Two, one.

1437
02:28:53,584 --> 02:28:54,209
Fire!

1438
02:28:58,418 --> 02:28:59,959
Look after our son.

1439
02:29:04,501 --> 02:29:05,918
And tell him I love him.

1440
02:29:55,543 --> 02:29:56,251
Yes?

1441
02:29:56,543 --> 02:29:58,584
Mission accomplished.
We're out.

1442
02:29:59,043 --> 02:30:01,959
With Tiger? Or without Tiger?

1443
02:30:02,668 --> 02:30:03,584
Without Tiger.

1444
02:30:08,626 --> 02:30:10,168
All the nurses are safe.

1445
02:30:11,209 --> 02:30:13,251
We got them out.

1446
02:30:14,834 --> 02:30:16,418
Connect me to the Prime Minister.

1447
02:30:24,293 --> 02:30:27,334
Azaan saved your life.

1448
02:30:28,251 --> 02:30:31,584
In the name of humanity,
it's his right and your duty.

1449
02:30:47,293 --> 02:30:48,418
Javed, my friend...

1450
02:30:49,084 --> 02:30:50,918
...fly your flag too!

1451
02:31:03,334 --> 02:31:05,084
Well done, Tiger!

1452
02:31:14,876 --> 02:31:16,876
You'll hear a little whistling.

1453
02:31:17,168 --> 02:31:18,084
Bye bye.

1454
02:32:10,543 --> 02:32:12,126
- Sir?
- Yes, Karan?

1455
02:32:13,918 --> 02:32:18,959
There's an email with a coded message
in Greek: "Saare jahaan se achha."

1456
02:32:23,918 --> 02:32:24,709
Hello?

1457
02:32:30,126 --> 02:32:31,626
Greetings on Independence Day.

1458
02:32:32,001 --> 02:32:36,543
You knew if you had returned
with those nurses...

1459
02:32:37,334 --> 02:32:39,334
...RAW would never let you go.

1460
02:32:44,543 --> 02:32:46,459
Remember, sir...

1461
02:32:47,043 --> 02:32:48,959
...if my country ever needs me...

1462
02:32:50,834 --> 02:32:52,668
...Tiger is alive!

1463
02:33:07,084 --> 02:33:08,251
<i>Hassan!</i>

1464
02:33:28,334 --> 02:33:30,126
Listen close to what I gotta say.

1465
02:33:32,626 --> 02:33:34,084
'Coz you know there ain't
no other way.

1466
02:33:37,334 --> 02:33:38,418
Love is the message.

1467
02:33:41,668 --> 02:33:42,168
You ready?

1468
02:33:42,584 --> 02:33:43,293
Let's go.

1469
02:33:43,834 --> 02:33:45,876
Yeah... we can make it better.

1470
02:33:46,126 --> 02:33:47,959
Yeah... when we come together.

1471
02:33:48,501 --> 02:33:50,418
Yeah... all you got is me and...

1472
02:33:50,668 --> 02:33:52,543
Yeah... all I got is you.

1473
02:34:06,459 --> 02:34:08,293
Nothing is beyond love.
Nothing.

1474
02:34:08,709 --> 02:34:10,543
Nothing is better than love.

1475
02:34:11,043 --> 02:34:12,876
Nothing is above love.

1476
02:34:13,293 --> 02:34:15,168
Without love, we're nothing.

1477
02:34:15,501 --> 02:34:17,293
Nothing is higher than love.

1478
02:34:17,751 --> 02:34:19,584
Nothing is superior to love.

1479
02:34:20,001 --> 02:34:21,876
Nothing is as good as love.

1480
02:34:22,293 --> 02:34:24,334
Without love, we're nothing.

1481
02:34:24,834 --> 02:34:28,376
Those who come to us
with hearts full of love.

1482
02:34:29,043 --> 02:34:32,876
We shall hug them tight,
that's our way.

1483
02:34:33,501 --> 02:34:35,709
With swag, we welcome all.

1484
02:34:42,668 --> 02:34:44,668
With swag, we welcome all.

1485
02:34:53,418 --> 02:34:55,168
Walking together.

1486
02:34:55,709 --> 02:34:57,543
Facing troubles head on.

1487
02:34:58,001 --> 02:34:59,584
Tomorrow will be a better day.

1488
02:35:00,418 --> 02:35:02,084
Tell everyone the same.

1489
02:35:02,418 --> 02:35:06,668
Let your heart steer your life.
Let feelings be your goal.

1490
02:35:07,001 --> 02:35:08,834
Meet me where I'm headed.

1491
02:35:09,418 --> 02:35:11,251
Tell everyone the same.

1492
02:35:12,334 --> 02:35:15,168
Those who come to us
with hearts full of love.

1493
02:35:16,584 --> 02:35:20,376
We shall hug them tight,
that's our way.

1494
02:35:21,001 --> 02:35:23,084
With swag, we welcome all.

1495
02:35:23,626 --> 02:35:25,668
Ya'll ready to bring the riff back?

1496
02:35:32,376 --> 02:35:34,459
With swag, we welcome all.

1497
02:36:13,293 --> 02:36:15,126
Nothing is beyond love.
Nothing.

1498
02:36:15,543 --> 02:36:17,334
Nothing is better than love.

1499
02:36:17,793 --> 02:36:19,543
Nothing is above love.

1500
02:36:20,126 --> 02:36:22,001
Without love, we're nothing.

1501
02:36:22,334 --> 02:36:24,168
Nothing is higher than love.

1502
02:36:24,584 --> 02:36:26,418
Nothing is superior to love.

1503
02:36:26,834 --> 02:36:28,709
Nothing is as good as love.

1504
02:36:29,084 --> 02:36:30,876
Without love, we're nothing.

1505
02:36:31,709 --> 02:36:35,001
Those who come to us
with hearts full of love.

1506
02:36:35,918 --> 02:36:39,793
We shall hug them tight,
that's our way.

1507
02:36:40,376 --> 02:36:42,584
With swag, we welcome all.

1508
02:36:49,501 --> 02:36:51,668
With swag, we welcome all.

1509
02:37:07,668 --> 02:37:09,459
With swag, we welcome all.
