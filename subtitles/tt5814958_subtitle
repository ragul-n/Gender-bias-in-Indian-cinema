1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,042


3
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:08,917
And to all those jerks who
download and watch movies..

4
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:09,708
Our warm greetings.

5
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,125
I am Mahabali Maha.

6
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,958
I'm going to recite an
awesome story.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Royapuram is the most
powerful place in Madras.

8
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,458
This is the most powerful
throne in Royapuram.

9
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,375
The who sits on it is called Naina.

10
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,125
Naina stands for justice.

11
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,167
With growing hatred towards
good doings of Naina...

12
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:29,500
his son finished him
off and replaced him.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,833
Bad boy!

14
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:33,333
Blaggard became the Naina...

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
so the area became very worst.

16
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:38,708
No one seemed to be revolting
against his atrocities.

17
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,208
But three friends...

18
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,292
Benjamin, Doss and the
guy with the funk....

19
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:45,375
Me; Mahabali Maha.

20
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,708
We couldn't stand it.

21
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,833
Doss is very powerful in Royapuram.

22
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,875
Benjamin my chaddi
buddy and bestie...

23
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,667
was a specialist in planning.

24
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,958
I was special in
gathering henchmen.

25
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,917
So, Benjamin made a plan and...

26
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,583
I gathered henchmen.

27
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,000
And Doss finished off Naina.

28
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,542
There came the
twist in the plot.

29
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,083
Both Doss and Benjamin
wanted Naina's throne.

30
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,542
Another huge twist in the plot.

31
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,542
Both of them liked the same girl.

32
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:14,375
That girl liked Benjamin.

33
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,917
Since Benjamin got
Dhanam (the girl)...

34
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:19,625
Doss snatched away the throne.

35
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,500
When I revolted against this,
Doss turned his back on me.

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,958
That provoked me and
I challenged him.

37
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,958
The day my bestie Benjamin
sits on Naina's throne...

38
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:31,000
is the day I'll let the
hair grow on my head.

39
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,958
However, Doss did do good
things as the Naina.

40
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:38,000
Benjamin got married to
the love of his life.

41
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,625
Doss too got married.

42
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:41,500
He had a daughter.

43
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,500
She is our story's...

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,667
So obviously...

45
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,458
Benjamin had a....

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,833
You guessed it right.

47
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,042
A son.

48
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,500
And he is our story's...

49
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,583
This is a very simple story.

50
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,958
How the hero wins over
heroine's heart and...

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,792
how he becomes the
Naina forms the story.

52
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,875
The biggest twist of the
plot is that the hero...

53
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,833
Wait, if I reveal it
then I'll be a goner.

54
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,500
Now confess.

55
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,375
No sir, I didn't do it

56
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,542
Your face gives it away that
you are from Royapuram.

57
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,333
I swear I didn't do it.

58
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,625
Sir, he is from Naina's area.

59
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,375
It'll be a big issue
if he comes to know.

60
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,333
What do you mean?

61
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:51,833
Now go order a juice for me.

62
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:01,458
I ordered a juice.

63
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,292
This is not for you.

64
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,542
The devil is here!

65
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,083
- Subbiah.
- Yes sir.

66
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,292
Looks like new here, the
tea doesn't look usual.

67
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,667
Yes, a young fellow.

68
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,542
He must have done it
by mistake, Doss.

69
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,208
I hope he won't repeat it.

70
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:39,000
You!

71
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,917
Know this first.

72
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,667
Not everyone in
Royapuram are rogues.

73
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:45,042
People here vary from a
fisherman to I.T professionals.

74
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,083
The skin tone might be the same.

75
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,083
That doesn't mean you can
assume and arrest him.

76
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,208
Now me? I am rogue.

77
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,542
Shall I prove it?

78
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,375
Looks like he got scared.

79
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:55,667
Doss...

80
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,583
he will be fine going forward.

81
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,792
Mind your own business.

82
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,958
Come on Doss, let's leave.

83
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll finish you off!

84
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,792
Catch you later.

85
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,417
Subbiah, inform our men
and bail out the guy.

86
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,208
Sure Doss.

87
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:24,750
( Speaks Gibberish)

88
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,833
Didn't you hear him say " Get in"

89
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:33,958
What is it Sekar?

90
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,417
Don't you remember?

91
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,292
- Our men can survive only if they've a boat.
- Greetings.

92
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:42,042
Welcome Sekar.

93
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,083
Have a seat.

94
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:55,542
Come sit.

95
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,083
I told only you to have a seat.
Why is that pimp sitting?

96
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,208
Well that..

97
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,083
You sit down.

98
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,792
Sekar, now that you are with him,

99
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,083
I sense that it has to do
something with women trafficking?

100
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,083
But I hope it's not that.

101
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,625
Well Naina. There is
an order from abroad.

102
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,625
It is to traffick women through ships.
It cannot be done in the harbour.

103
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:20,417
If you agree it can be
done here at Royapuram.

104
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,458
It'll also be a work for the
guys to earn something.

105
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,458
How much?

106
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,750
Naina, that depends
on each woman.

107
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,417
We can earn upto 1 million.

108
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,542
So you've decided to
do anything for money.

109
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:31,625
Anything for money Naina.

110
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,750
That means we can finish
of Sekar right here.

111
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:34,792
How much will you pay?

112
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,458
Naina, I'll pay 0.1 million.

113
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,125
I'll myself finish him off.

114
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,167
Naina, I'll pay half a million.

115
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:44,125
Additionally I'll take care
of his wife and mistress too.

116
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:46,042
Naina, send him out.

117
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,500
I'll finish him off.

118
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:51,333
From tomorrow we'll take control of
his area and shopping complexes.

119
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,458
So Sekar?

120
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,042
Looks like more than women
the demand for you is high.

121
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:57,708
Anything for money? Right?

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,708
Sekar...

123
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:07,083
(Speaks Gibberish)

124
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,208
What?

125
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,500
I said I'll drown him in the sea.

126
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,250
Do you hear?

127
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,667
You are a rogue by business...

128
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,708
but he is rogue by birth.

129
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:22,042
Where are you?

130
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,500
On my way home.

131
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,625
Did you eat something?

132
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,292
Did you eat?

133
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,000
Guess he hasn't.

134
00:07:33,292 --> 00:07:34,583
Set up dinner for both of us.

135
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,375
Ok fine.

136
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,250
Why have you stopped here?

137
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,208
Naina, they have got my kids.

138
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,000
I had no clue what to do.

139
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:57,208
I've been loyal to you all these years.
I've place weapons in the back seat.

140
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:59,042
Save yourself.

141
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,292
Forgive me.

142
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,125
Be careful with the weapons.
Watchout!

143
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,833
I've grown old Subbiah.

144
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,292
Earlier I could
stand against many.

145
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,208
Yesterday I was gasping to
fight against four of them.

146
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,917
Thankfully I escaped yesterday.

147
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,208
Who will take over if
something happens to me?

148
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,500
For 40 odd years they
have been with us.

149
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,750
Dhanam too will complete
her studies in two months.

150
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,042
I should take care of her too.

151
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,708
The area too should
be in our control.

152
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,875
We have got enemies all around.

153
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:01,125
The next person to sit on Naina's
throne should be my son in law.

154
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,750
I want you to take
responsibility.

155
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,250
Search everywhere.

156
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,083
Find an electrifying person.

157
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,292
I shall Naina. I shall find
a king for you Naina.

158
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:13,750
I will find an apt son in law
for you in this Chennai!

159
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,083
(Speaks Gibberish)

160
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,458
(Speaks Gibberish)

161
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,500
Leader, what the hell did you just say?

162
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,958
I meant our guy is someone
on a whole new level.

163
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,000
I request the couple
to come forward.

164
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,542
Heavy rain...

165
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,458
Cool breeze...

166
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,875
Both of us are alone during the night.

167
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,250
Tell me what would I do?

168
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,167
I'll myself answer it.

169
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,208
But before that get me two
tickets for Vijay's movie

170
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,583
One is for you.

171
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:06,542
Another one?

172
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,042
Another one to place the popcorn.

173
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,417
Heavy rain...

174
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,458
Cool breeze...

175
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:18,000
Both of us are alone during the night.

176
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:18,958
Alone!

177
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:20,875
Tell me what would I do?

178
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,375
I'll myself answer it.

179
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,875
But before that
buy me an Iphone.

180
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:27,583
Iphone?

181
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:28,792
Why?

182
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,250
To have your pic as the
wall paper and adore you.

183
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,417
Heavy rain...

184
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,208
Cool breeze...

185
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,667
Both of us are alone during the night.

186
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,042
Tell me what would I do?

187
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,292
I'll myself answer it.

188
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,625
But before that buy
me a scooter dear.

189
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,667
Scooter?

190
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:49,667
Why?

191
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,750
Everytime I hug you when you drive.
It's high time you hug me when I drive.

192
00:10:58,667 --> 00:10:59,917
Heavy rain...

193
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,250
Cool breeze...

194
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,875
Both of us are alone.

195
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,583
Just like you wished. Alone!

196
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:06,500
What would you do?

197
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,625
I'll hand you over
the invitation.

198
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,375
What invitation?

199
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:10,583
My marriage invitation.

200
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,917
Dear brother Johnny...

201
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,083
Heavy rain...

202
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,917
Cool breeze...

203
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,375
Now complete it!

204
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,958
As a brother you did
lot of things for me.

205
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,750
Would you please walk me down
the aisle during the wedding?

206
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,458
Do not forget to buy the ring.

207
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:26,833
Brother?

208
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,375
Ring.

209
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,458
Couples may now
exchange the rings.

210
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,708
My brother Johnny has it safely.

211
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,375
I'll get it.

212
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,500
Give it.

213
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,583
Careful. It might hurt him.

214
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,667
Come on, nothing will
hurt my brother Johnny.

215
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,542
Let this union done by
God be strong forever.

216
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,292
My wishes to the couple.

217
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,292
Now you are a married couple.

218
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,750
Heavy rain...

219
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,042
Cool breeze...

220
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,250
Both of us...

221
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,542
All alone.

222
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,375
Who in the hell is he?

223
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:21,500
Dude...

224
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:22,375
Jenny?

225
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,750
She ain't Jenny...

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,083
but she was the spirit
who possessed me.

227
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:26,792
How can she do this to you?

228
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,458
Now that's girls for you.

229
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,500
How could you?

230
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,250
How could you laugh?

231
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,333
Now that's boys for you.

232
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,250
How did you get it?

233
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,375
Now that's friend for you.

234
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,542
Now this is awesome!

235
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:48,750
Do not trust girls.

236
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,750
Never believe your eyes.
You'll be deceived.

237
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,083
It's all deception. Tears
is all that'll be left.

238
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,375
Love is wicked.

239
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,375
Always trust your friends.

240
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,167
A friend will put his life on line for you.
Friendship is always honest.

241
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:29,625
Never believe your eyes. You'll be
deceived. Tears is all that'll be left.

242
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,292
Stop it.

243
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,667
How dare you take the advance and dance
over there. I'm not going to pay you.

244
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,000
Sorry sir.

245
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:16,042
Dear men stop trusting the girls who
empty you wallet at coffee shops.

246
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,833
Get drunk and get wasted.

247
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,917
In the end it'll be a friend
who will ensure your safety.

248
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:30,167
Listen to me my dear friend;
Girls are vicious like scorpions.

249
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:36,958
Never believe your eyes.
You'll be deceived.

250
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:24,625
You'll be trapped when you try
praising her when she smiles at you.

251
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:34,833
You'll lose yourself and drown like
the Titanic when she betrays you.

252
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:41,792
Your heart is soft and pure. Please
do not lose it in the name of Love.

253
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:48,958
Listen to me my dear friend. Friendship is the
best pillar of strength you'll ever find.

254
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:55,833
Never believe your eyes. You'll be
deceived. Tears is all that'll be left.

255
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,000
Love is wicked.

256
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:07,083
A friend will put his life on line
for you. Friendship is always honest.

257
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:18,208
Never believe your eyes. You'll be
deceived. Tears is all that'll be left.

258
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,417
Anchovy brothers proudly

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,583
Prove yourself and get
married to Naina's daughter.

261
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:33,167
All the contestants have arrived.

262
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,750
All here with their weapons.

263
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,458
Tell me 'Finger'.

264
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:39,375
- What's the status?
- All the accused are here.

265
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,000
We'll find the groom today!

266
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,750
All the contestants
are raring to go.

267
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:48,250
Let's meet them and see how qualified
they are to be the next Naina.

268
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:52,625
As we talk your son is chewing something.
What is it?

269
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,042
Show him how you finished off your dad
with that razor that you are chewing.

270
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,000
This fellow here seems to have
finished off his dad with razor.

271
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,875
Superb. Let's see who is
the next contestant.

272
00:17:00,917 --> 00:17:03,375
- Tell me.
- I was in Puzhal jail for eight years.

273
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,250
Four years in Tihar jail.

274
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,583
And last, I was in Vellore
jail for two years.

275
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,583
One year out of the two I
was kept in dark cell.

276
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,708
So I'm confident.

277
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,083
Looks like he is in
jail from birth.

278
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:13,833
Superb contestant.

279
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,083
Hold on, don't you snatch the mike.
Move!

280
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,167
Let's see the next contestant.

281
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,667
Here is a parent. Let's
see what he has to say.

282
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,083
Parent? I am a participant.

283
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,875
Would you like to
see my skillset?

284
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:27,708
Guess he is gone.

285
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,375
He appears to be older than Naina and has now
perished due to his obsession. Throw him out.

286
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,750
Let's move to next contestant.

287
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,208
Let us know about
your skillsets.

288
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:37,667
I've been taking part in this
competition for the past three seasons.

289
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,125
Naina has only one daughter.

290
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,250
Why do you lie?

291
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,000
Leave that. Tell us
about your skillsets.

292
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:47,000
"A musical cloud showers
honey down the earth"

293
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,500
Stop it.

294
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,625
What are you here for?

295
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,167
Sir, I vow to somehow win this
time and get that mega bumper prize.

296
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,458
Ok I get it. I know you.

297
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,000
You just get on in any queue
that you see and start singing.

298
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,083
Now get lost!

299
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:00,917
Now let's witness the audition.

300
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,667
This is 'Ondi Puli' signing off.

301
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,708
First contestant.

302
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,542
Raja. Amazing Raja.

303
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:08,708
Heard of me? I am the one.

304
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,667
Ever heard of me? I am the one.

305
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,917
Now tell me who
the hell are you?

306
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,750
I am the one.

307
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,208
Next contestant.

308
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,500
Stop showing off!

309
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,833
The name is Kumar! Kokki Kumar!

310
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:20,958
I'll slit you down!

311
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,208
Anybody there?

312
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,792
It's pitch dark!

313
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,708
Why in the hell did
you allow a blind?

314
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,750
Take him away!

315
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,000
I am too a rogue!

316
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:30,833
What is he doing?

317
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:32,833
Naina where is your daughter?

318
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,333
Watch out! How dare you?

319
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,083
That's my son!

320
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,375
What is a mason doing here?

321
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:41,292
Move! Get lost!

322
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,583
Mine, yours and your daughter's...

323
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,375
- What?
- He is talking in Hindi Naina.

324
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,583
I feel something inside me.

325
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,083
What in the hell is he blabbering?

326
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,250
Nothing Naina.

327
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:55,792
How do you feel losing
in this competition?

328
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,708
I performed well.

329
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,875
I mean, at this moment...

330
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,625
how has this failure affected you?

331
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,917
That is what I want to know.

332
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:05,958
You shouldn't cry.

333
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:06,542
No I am not.

334
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,750
Yes, you are.

335
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:08,292
No sir.

336
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,250
Your eyes are teary.

337
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,042
I am not crying,

338
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:10,375
You are.

339
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:11,083
I am not crying.

340
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,542
Cry you beast! Cry!

341
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,958
He is crying. This
episode will be a hit!

342
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:16,917
Come here.

343
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,625
Tell me Naina. How was the program?

344
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,792
Stop it. Why are you beating?

345
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:23,208
This was 'Finger' Babu's idea.

346
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,417
Now try laying
your hands on him.

347
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:27,458
Wait I'll show you! You
three 'Finger' Babu.

348
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,042
When there is no woman...

349
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,708
that's when men's
life will be heaven.

350
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,000
Let set out and search for
a life without women.

351
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:34,875
Indeed! We should.

352
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,667
What shall we do?

353
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,083
How about writing
an abusive song?

354
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:39,958
No!

355
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,625
We'll should do
something more severe.

356
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,458
Forgetting those angels...

357
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,125
In the desire to explore the world...

358
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:55,875
This Johnny is all set to fly.

359
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,708
No more botheration
about girls anymore.

360
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,167
I am going to become
a church father.

361
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,375
What?

362
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,125
I've made up my mind.

363
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,917
What audition is the
police carrying out?

364
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,333
Rammiya, come here.

365
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,625
Why is the security so
strict in our area?

366
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,208
Someone just finished off
'Saidai' Selvam and escaped.

367
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,750
We are on the hunt
for the killer.

368
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,583
What? Saidai Selvam is no more?

369
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:23,083
He was meant to be
finished off by me.

370
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,500
Instead of dying at your hands
he could electrocute himself.

371
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,917
Now stop irritating. Why
did you bring us here?

372
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,250
Fine, ask them to
move the barricades.

373
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,083
Open the gates.

374
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,917
Stop! Stop!

375
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:47,917
What is it?

376
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:49,500
I've got a small doubt.

377
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,375
Tell me brother Glory.

378
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,750
Wouldn't it be embarrassing for a church
father to be accused of drunk and drive?

379
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:55,083
It'll definitely be worse!

380
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,292
We are about to be
get caught, father.

381
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,792
- Where?
- Over there.

382
00:20:58,167 --> 00:20:59,625
"The evening cops"

383
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,375
Now turn.

384
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,333
Oops! Cops again. Double action?

385
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,375
Father, if we get caught then we'll
be penalized and jailed for 3 months.

386
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:06,083
Brother Glory,
what have we got?

387
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:08,583
Only affection,
kindness and peace.

388
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,375
- I meant what have you got in your hands?
- Chicken fried rice.

389
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,417
Guess he found there is
no ketchup with the rice.

390
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,250
This is awesome.

391
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,875
Stop!

392
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,167
Stop! Stop!

393
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,500
Stop!

394
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,500
Father you drove past the Satan!
Father you drove past the Satan!

395
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,292
Who is that singing about my father?

396
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,750
If they've escaped tricking the cops means
one of them must have finished off Selvam.

397
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,125
If he has finished off Selvam
means he must be skilled.

398
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:44,042
- Take a video of them.
- Wait and watch.

399
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:48,458
That was awesome father. We
just escaped from the police!

400
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,000
You heard that?

401
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,833
You aren't just father.
You are God Father!

402
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:56,083
This is awesome!

403
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,667
God father?

404
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,750
Looks like this fellow
is a talented rogue!

405
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:06,375
Mom I am going to
become a father.

406
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,333
What's the big deal?

407
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:11,500
Once you are married you'll
be a father in ten months.

408
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:13,458
I meant a priest.

409
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,458
So...

410
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,875
are you too going to
leave me like you dad?

411
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:20,417
Come on mom.

412
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:21,625
Listen dear...

413
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,375
You know your defect.

414
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,917
I've kept it a secret
from the whole world.

415
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,542
Don't you go away and reveal it.

416
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:30,667
What do you mean by defect?

417
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,125
10 people in every 100 has it.
I googled it.

418
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,542
You rank first among those 10.

419
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:36,708
I've decided to leave.

420
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,083
You won't. You
aren't that worthy.

421
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:43,917
Listen Dhanam.

422
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:45,875
I'll definitely leave.

423
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:46,958
Yeah right!

424
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,167
Oh my god! The diseases
has taken effect!

425
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:09,958
Yeah right!

426
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:11,042
Yeah right!

427
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:12,042
Yeah right!

428
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:13,042
Yeah right!

429
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,083
Yeah right!

430
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:15,292
Yeah right!

431
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:16,833
Yeah right!

432
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:19,292
Oh my god!

433
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,208
We've been to all the hospitals.

434
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:22,917
Been to all the churches.

435
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,500
Consulted all the priests.

436
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,083
Yet there is no cure
for this diseases.

437
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,250
Mom, lower you voice.

438
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:29,667
People might hear you.

439
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,458
Stop showing off your dignity.

440
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:36,125
The minute you see blood you start repeating
what you heard last and go like this.

441
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,333
If not a disease
then what is it?

442
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,417
It's not a disease mom.
It's called Phobia.

443
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:41,792
That's in English.

444
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,667
No.

445
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,833
I'm going to be a priest. Are
you fine with it or not?

446
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,000
A happy news for you folks.

447
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,125
This year from our group...

448
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:56,125
- a volunteer has stepped forward to get trained for priesthood.
- I thought you were kidding.

449
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,292
You are great.

450
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:00,125
No. No. God is great.

451
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,625
The individual who is prepared
for the training is...

452
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:06,208
Benjamin and Dhanam's son...

453
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,708
Johnny Thuyamani Benjamin.

454
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:09,958
My friend Johnny!

455
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
My friend Johnny!

456
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:11,833
My friend Johnny!

457
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:20,417
Accompanying him is Aashirvardham and
Adaikalarani's son, Glory Kovilpillai.

458
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,667
What? No I am not coming.

459
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:23,208
No I won't.

460
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,833
I call them upon to the dias.

461
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:26,958
Glory!

462
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,917
Please don't leave me.

463
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:31,875
I don't need another father.

464
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:32,792
Save me!

465
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:35,458
- Please listen to me. Don't do this dude.
- Quite.

466
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,333
Do you know about my phobia?

467
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Who will take care of me?

468
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:39,750
Come on now.

469
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:41,083
Are you too betraying
me like her?

470
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:42,042
Oh! Oh! There he goes.

471
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:42,917
So you won't come?

472
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,542
This guy is so sentimental lord!

473
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:48,958
Let's cheer them up and
give them an applause.

474
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,542
Everyone seems to be
happy about this.

475
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:54,833
Look at the tears
of joy in his eyes.

476
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:08,083
Father...

477
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:09,750
This is awesome.

478
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:13,333
We are headed to a divine place.

479
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:14,958
So first...

480
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,417
let's change your wallpaper.

481
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,875
- What the...?
- Give it to me.

482
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,333
Until last month you had an
actress on your wallpaper.

483
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:21,625
What's this?

484
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:24,292
Why all the fantasy when you
are going to be a priest?

485
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:24,833
Careful.

486
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:32,333
The reason behind all the youths
getting spoiled is Facebook.

487
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:33,833
First you come out of this.

488
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,042
What about you?

489
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,000
I'll think about it.

490
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:38,125
Father!

491
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:39,542
- Ban liquor!
- Ban liquor!

492
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:40,292
Give it to me.

493
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,583
You guys protest.

494
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:42,625
I'll hold it.

495
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:43,167
Wake up fellow men!

496
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,042
Ban liquor!

497
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:44,875
Wake up fellow men!

498
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,792
Ban liquor!

499
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:46,667
Wake up fellow men!

500
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:47,667
I'll thrash you!

501
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:48,542
I said ban liquor.

502
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,208
But you are hiding
it not banning.

503
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:53,792
Here after do not sell
liquor to me or anyone.

504
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:54,833
Do you understand?

505
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:55,792
Tell me.

506
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:56,792
Do you understand?

507
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:57,625
Call her your sister.

508
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:58,833
No. Please.

509
00:25:59,208 --> 00:25:59,833
Go ahead.

510
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:00,292
Dude!

511
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:02,833
- My hands ache  because imagining her I had..
- Hold it!

512
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:04,375
I had wrote many love letters.

513
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,917
Look, someday she is going to betray
you and make you her brother.

514
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:10,042
So why not you make
her your sister.

515
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:11,625
It'll be a new trend.

516
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:13,542
Sister!

517
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:15,917
My pleasure.

518
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,083
Mom.

519
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:27,667
14 years course.

520
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:29,375
10 days of vacation every year.

521
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:31,750
Those 10 days I'll indulge
myself in social service.

522
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:34,292
I think this is our last meet.

523
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:37,208
I feel that you'll
be back in ten days.

524
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:37,792
Mom!

525
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:38,542
What is it?

526
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:40,917
Just like how you were
a good mother to me...

527
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:43,542
I'll be a good father
to the whole world.

528
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,125
God bless you my child.

529
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,458
Don't leave me.

530
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:50,083
Dad!

531
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,458
In times when children address
their father as father...

532
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,667
how many are lucky to call
their child a father?

533
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:55,750
Let me bless you.

534
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,375
You are blessed.

535
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:58,833
May the lord be with you.

536
00:26:58,875 --> 00:26:59,792
Hallelujah

537
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:00,417
Dear...

538
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,167
Father Kovil...

539
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,833
Look, it's like the
lord is calling me.

540
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:06,792
It's not the lord.

541
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,083
It's your useless friend Johnny.

542
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,500
This is awesome.

543
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:14,917
Glory!

544
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,583
Stop. Stop. Stop.

545
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:19,625
Hold on.

546
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Greetings father.

547
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:23,500
Greetings disciple.

548
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:24,625
Where are you going father?

549
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:26,333
I'm on my way to get
trained in priesthood.

550
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,583
Please hop into my rickshaw.

551
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:32,333
Let it be written down in history that my
rickshaw helped you on your spiritual journey.

552
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,458
What about the passengers?

553
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:35,250
Forget them.

554
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:36,208
I'll clear them off.

555
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,208
Get down!

556
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,417
Please find another rickshaw.

557
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,917
Please get in father.

558
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,625
The ones who were
termed as drunkards...

559
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,042
are now termed as fathers.

560
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:47,250
You are the sole reason
behind this father Johnny.

561
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,042
I was just doing my
duty father Glory.

562
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,708
Father I've become pure.

563
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,500
I don't need more
colors in life.

564
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,042
Why is my kerchief
in this color?

565
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,000
I've opened up my life for you.

566
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,667
Can you get me a white kerchief?

567
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,833
Ofcourse father glory.

568
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,333
Welcome sir. What
do you want sir?

569
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:03,292
Where can I get white kerchiefs?

570
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,292
Why are you talking to girls?

571
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,250
Sorry father.

572
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:07,875
Are there no male staffs here?

573
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:12,667
It's girls everywhere
around here.

574
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:14,458
You go buy yourself.

575
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,375
Kerchief!

576
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,875
You shouldn't even touch
female mannequin Johnny.

577
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:33,417
Father Glory?

578
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:34,792
Where are you?

579
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:36,583
It's dark in here.

580
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:38,083
Let's head to the path of light.

581
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,208
Where are you guys?

582
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,708
The power too is out.

583
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:42,792
We are here.

584
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,208
It's darkness everywhere.

585
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:45,458
Turn on the flash light.

586
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:46,375
Hold on.

587
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:50,042
I didn't see her hip.

588
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,792
I didn't see her hip.

589
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,542
Looks awesome.

590
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:03,042
Nice color.

591
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:03,792
Yeah.

592
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,292
It's nice.

593
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,208
- How is it?
- Superb.

594
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:16,958
Thank you.

595
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:18,000
Yes!

596
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,625
You may have it.

597
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:22,917
How about a selfie?

598
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:26,042
How is it?

599
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:27,375
Nice. Isn't it?

600
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,208
It's mindblowing.

601
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,000
Three for thirty bucks.

602
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:30,625
It'll be nice.

603
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,208
- Could it be?
- Buy it.

604
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,417
It can't be!

605
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:35,292
No.

606
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:36,375
Never.

607
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,417
Fine. Let's leave.

608
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:39,625
She doesn't look that great.

609
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,083
What is it father?

610
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:43,000
Why is your shirt unbuttoned?

611
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:45,000
Even the cuffs are folded?

612
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,500
I understand father.

613
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:48,458
It's because you are
sweating due to power-cut.

614
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:49,333
But father...

615
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:51,750
do you know what I think?

616
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:56,792
I think that you are trying to
sin as I try to buy kerchief!

617
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,708
Please forgive me for
thinking so father.

618
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,042
Please forgive me.

619
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,917
Stop massaging me and
forgive me father. Please.

620
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:06,667
- Sorry.
- I don't know anything father.

621
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:11,667
Brother.

622
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:12,750
Take left.

623
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,167
There she is at the
ice cream parlour.

624
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:19,583
Why not for one last time...

625
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,208
let's have an ice cream?

626
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:33,833
Could it be?

627
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,375
It can't be.

628
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:40,875
He won't hang up.

629
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:41,833
Father.

630
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:44,542
We are here to have ice cream
for the last time.

631
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:50,333
But my useless mind tells me that
you are following that girl!

632
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,083
Please forgive me father.

633
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:55,125
Shame! It's a shame!

634
00:30:59,375 --> 00:30:59,917
It's raining.

635
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,167
Wow. Come let's get drenched.

636
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:03,708
- Come on.
- No!

637
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:10,417
Why shouldn’t we, for the last time...

638
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:11,750
get drenched in the rain?

639
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:13,042
Jolly!

640
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:13,917
Shut up!

641
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:16,458
Father, won't it rain at
where we are going?

642
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,625
- Why? Isn't the rain over here enough?
- Crazy!

643
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:20,958
Still it won't be same as
getting drenched in our place.

644
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:21,542
Come on.

645
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:23,750
Come on, before the rain stops.

646
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:26,042
- Shut up and get lost.
- Come on father.

647
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,917
Look at him crazy fellow! Doesn't
even know to enjoy the rain.

648
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:44,042
Father, looks like the
dams are overflowing.

649
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,542
Let's go before it
floods everywhere.

650
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:46,625
Why do you worry?

651
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,042
Enjoy the rain father. Enjoy
as much as you want.

652
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,542
Keep getting drenched and
enjoy the rain father.

653
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:55,417
Father even now
also I've sinned!

654
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:58,250
My mind tells me that you have liked
the girl you saw at the shop...

655
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,333
and have fallen in love with her.
I've sinned thinking so.

656
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:02,458
I've sinned father.

657
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,333
My mind has sinned.

658
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,125
I too feel the same bro.

659
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,500
Damn it!

660
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,333
Come here my dear mommy.

661
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:13,417
Your good old Johnny is here.

662
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,375
Stop behaving like a don who
is returning back home.

663
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,125
So why are you back?

664
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:16,792
Mom.

665
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,583
I am back.

666
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:20,250
I thought you will
be back in 10 days.

667
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:22,125
Now, you are back by 10 O clock.

668
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:22,750
Get in.

669
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:24,500
Open the door mom.

670
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:25,042
Please mom.

671
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,083
Stop irritating me you drunkard!

672
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:29,375
The door is open. Get in.

673
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:33,958
What have I given birth to?

674
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,417
Father Aashirvardham...

675
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,625
you son Kovilpillai is here.

676
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:39,917
Dad. Dad you there?

677
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,333
Dad please don't tell me that
you have committed suicide.

678
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,375
I am back.

679
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,417
Your son Kovilpullai is back.

680
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:57,625
Damn you sinner!

681
00:32:58,333 --> 00:32:59,292
Glory?

682
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,250
What are you up to dad?

683
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:02,875
Dear Glory....

684
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,583
what did the great Thiruvalluvar preach?

685
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:06,542
What did he preach?

686
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:09,625
" What you sow during the
early times will reap later"

687
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:11,125
But what are you upto?

688
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,750
You are my only child.

689
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:16,167
And you left to become a priest.

690
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:23,208
So I was planning to become a
father again by having another son.

691
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:24,625
Another son?

692
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:25,667
Ofcourse.

693
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:30,875
I do need a heir to perform
the last rites for me.

694
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,000
Tell me and I shall do it right away.

695
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,000
But now you are back.

696
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:40,458
If you had come late by say half an hour...

697
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:41,833
it would have been perfect.

698
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:42,833
Why so?

699
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:45,625
All the preparation has gone waste.

700
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,083
Don't worry it won't go waste.

701
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,333
Give it to me.

702
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:51,667
Do you think you could have?

703
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:54,125
I certainly can!
I certainly can!

704
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,917
Naina you were right.

705
00:33:58,458 --> 00:33:59,500
The broker is a traitor.

706
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:01,750
Remember Sekar's proposal
for women trafficking...

707
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,542
- Yes.
- With Panayamuthy's help they are carrying it out using the motorboat.

708
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:06,792
Where is Sekar now?

709
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:09,167
I inquired. Seems he hasn't
returned home since 4 days.

710
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:11,667
He is put up in a hide out
behind Jai Nagar ladies hostel.

711
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,250
Doss...

712
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:15,792
It's at Jai Nagar hostel
our daughter is staying.

713
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:19,292
That's what is
concerning me a little.

714
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:25,500
I even doubt that, it was him who tried
to finish you off the other day.

715
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:27,208
Chances are high Naina.

716
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:29,083
When does that locality sleep?

717
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,583
By night nine all the
shops will be shut.

718
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,667
It'll be pitch dark.

719
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:33,708
So then finish it of by 10 p.m.

720
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,000
Fixed?

721
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:36,625
Fine Naina.

722
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:40,792
Why are you afraid?

723
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:42,667
You are doing this because
you trust me right?

724
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:43,917
Definitely it'll be done.

725
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:45,583
I hope the money part will
be settled as promised.

726
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,625
It'll be.

727
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,958
Remember I am opposing Naina.

728
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,708
So when do we start?

729
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:53,625
10 O clock the warden will go to sleep.
We can start by 10:05 p.m.

730
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:12,333
Here Johnny. It was here I
dropped off that girl once.

731
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:14,417
She went into that hostel.

732
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,458
Bro, I can see a body builder
sitting there with a weapon.

733
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,917
- Let's return.
- No!

734
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,667
I'll have to find about
her and impress her.

735
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:26,375
It'll be waste of time. I am
sure she has a boyfriend.

736
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,250
How sure are you?

737
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,125
It's already night.

738
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,667
I am sure she'll be on the
phone with her boyfriend.

739
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,000
You just wait and watch.

740
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:32,833
Come let's find out.

741
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:33,667
Come on.

742
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:35,458
But how do we go?

743
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,375
Look at him and the
weapon he has.

744
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:39,125
We'll go through
the back entrance.

745
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:42,125
Get down.

746
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:44,333
You see the locked house?

747
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:47,083
The hostel is right behind this.

748
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:47,875
How do you know?

749
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:49,167
You think only you guys come here?

750
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:51,208
I too have come here to
see the hostel warden.

751
00:35:55,042 --> 00:35:55,875
Give back my phone.

752
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,375
I need to call my sweet darling Philomina.

753
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,750
Is that the hostel warden?

754
00:35:58,958 --> 00:35:59,917
That's my wife's name.

755
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:00,875
Forget it now.

756
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,083
That's impossible. I've tried.

757
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,583
Fine, I'll go check.

758
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,458
Come down when I whistle.

759
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,333
Fine!

760
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,042
My cell phone is with you.

761
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,667
Give it back and then leave.

762
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:10,583
What is it?

763
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:12,042
Stop repeating it.

764
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,292
15 more mins to go.

765
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:15,500
We can get in only after
they turn off the lights.

766
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:16,542
You better do it Sekar.

767
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,833
You trust me right?

768
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,875
I'll call you once I am done.

769
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:21,875
We'll start by 10 itself.

770
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:25,208
There!

771
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:27,458
Shut up and follow!

772
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,917
Get down and stand height wise.

773
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:37,792
Why are there so many clothes
drying out in a locked home?

774
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:39,042
Look at the size of this dress.

775
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:40,875
I am sure there is a
bombshell living here.

776
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:43,125
She is in the third room.

777
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:45,708
You guys will have to
get down the stairs.

778
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:57,208
On my way to see my girl. You are on
your way to see someone else's girl.

779
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,625
I'll thrash you!

780
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:00,167
What is that?

781
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:02,458
I just met my girl.

782
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,250
Who in the hell is
this black panda?

783
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:05,833
Remove your glasses.

784
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,417
Why so late bro?

785
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,250
They will turn off the
lights in 10 mins.

786
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,583
What would you do then?

787
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,000
- Right.
- Irresponsible!

788
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:14,208
It's because of people
like you we get caught.

789
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:15,292
Quick. Make it quick!

790
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:17,417
Here take this kerchief
and cover yourselves.

791
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,083
Thanks panda.

792
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:19,833
Come on.

793
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:24,667
Ondi...

794
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,125
Check what is it.

795
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:27,875
Why can't you check
for yourself?

796
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:32,042
Now who in hell is this fellow?

797
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,042
Real smooth, let me kidnap him.

798
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:34,875
Gotcha!

799
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:37,375
Tell me the truth.

800
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,458
Aren't you one of Sekar's men?

801
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,792
I am Sangeetha's man.

802
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:42,083
Aren't you one of Sekar's men?

803
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:42,875
Sangeetha's man.

804
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:44,958
When did Sekar change
his name to Sangeetha?

805
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:46,083
Tell me!

806
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:46,583
Tell me!

807
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:47,625
I am Sangeetha's man!

808
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:48,667
Leave him.

809
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,667
Let him go.

810
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,875
Look at him, doll face!
Get lost!

811
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,083
Stop showing off!

812
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,500
Already this fellow here
won't stop showing off!

813
00:37:58,875 --> 00:37:59,833
That's the bathroom.

814
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:00,750
Come on. Come on.

815
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:03,958
Please brighten it a bit.

816
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:05,250
What the...

817
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:07,208
Reduce my size too.

818
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:10,917
She thinks she is a heroine.
Wait and watch!

819
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:18,375
That's Jenny!

820
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,917
What about Hema?

821
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,542
Oh yeah!

822
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,333
- Let's make a move.
- Smart fellow.

823
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:23,958
It's getting late.

824
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,292
Every girl here seems
to be on the phone.

825
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:30,458
Let's return. I am sure
your girl has a guy.

826
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:31,583
Indeed.

827
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:32,917
I am her guy.

828
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:33,875
How dare you cheat?

829
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:36,250
What?

830
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:39,917
Weren't you in love? Then why back
off at the most critical hour?

831
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,917
I told you.

832
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,208
Your girl has a guy.

833
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,625
Can't you see they are fighting?

834
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:45,292
They'll break up.

835
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,625
Then I'll swoop in.

836
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:47,667
Not only that...

837
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,333
you think you can escape after
everything has happened?

838
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:52,417
Looks like everything is done.

839
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,208
No problem. That's
the current trend.

840
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,333
If not her then someone else.

841
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:57,458
When there is no option
then do not bother.

842
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:59,208
Are you so shameless?

843
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,625
So what about the
register marriage?

844
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,167
Where is it?

845
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:05,125
What are you looking for?

846
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:08,208
She just said that marriage is over.
I was looking for the kids.

847
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:10,917
Your girl doesn't have a
guy but has a husband!

848
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,333
She isn't a girlfriend to
someone infact she is a wife.

849
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:13,917
Let's go.

850
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,667
Now come on let's return.

851
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:18,917
Why would you want
to plead on my behlaf?

852
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,542
Give me the phone.

853
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:20,917
Hey hold on.

854
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:24,875
Look here my dad is already
looking for groom.

855
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:27,583
In three days I am going
to tell him about us.

856
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:30,375
If you still stay afraid of him...

857
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,917
then I can't do anything about it.

858
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:34,750
Why would you have this
coward as your boyfriend?

859
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:39,750
An ideal guy should be brave and
should face many men at a time.

860
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:44,292
He must be ready to take
on the world for his girl.

861
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:48,208
In short, he must
like bloodshed.

862
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,625
I guess she having a husband
would have been a better end!

863
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:59,458
The power is out!

864
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:01,458
Now go.

865
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,042
Here comes the bodybuilder.

866
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:15,625
Wrong timing!

867
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:16,375
Hold on!

868
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:17,542
Hold on!

869
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:20,292
Do not stab, he might bleed
and there might be blood.

870
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:22,458
No no I am not a thief aunty.

871
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:23,708
Aunty sorry. Please.

872
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,167
Aunty please don't beat me.

873
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,417
Come let's escape.

874
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,292
Who are you?

875
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:41,458
Look someone is lying here.

876
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,500
We have rounded up the place.

877
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:52,708
Who is that who finished
off Sekar then?

878
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,417
Who is that skating
at this hour?

879
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,125
Let me shoot it.

880
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,000
He would have got us caught!

881
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:23,750
Why are you laughing now?

882
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:25,250
My girl doesn't have a guy!

883
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:27,042
Get this right inside your head.

884
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,208
Jumping off the roof expecting
a super hero to save and...

885
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:30,667
falling in love with a
fair woman are the same.

886
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,208
No one has ever survived both.

887
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:33,958
My girl doesn't have a guy!

888
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:40,458
My girl doesn't have a guy.

889
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:41,833
My girl doesn't have a guy.

890
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,667
My girl doesn't have a guy.

891
00:41:57,583 --> 00:42:00,583
My dear flower.
My dear birdie.

892
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,958
My dear peanut brittle.
My dear sugar candy.

893
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,500
Stop tattooing my heart
with your love.

894
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:11,000
Let me get into your heart.
So wait

895
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:14,917
My dear. Oh my dear.
Come to me.

896
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:45,375
You are the sky.
 I am the land.

897
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:48,875
Feed me your love
and I shall live.

898
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,292
You are as pure as the gold.
I am rough like the tar.

899
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:55,792
Give me a look dear.
That'll boost me up.

900
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:59,500
What an awesome feeling.
 I feel like I am a hero.

901
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:02,667
Oh darling I am confused.

902
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:05,875
Now, stop tattooing my
heart with your love.

903
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,333
Let me get into your heart.
So wait

904
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:13,250
My dear. Oh my dear. I am
going to make you mine.

905
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:23,125
In no time she took
my heart away.

906
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,625
It was like I was
electrocuted, stuck and numb.

907
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:29,958
Just like the sun
she shone upon me.

908
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,417
I got high in her love.

909
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:37,208
Gaana song is racy.
So is the dance.

910
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,250
Perform it and it's mindblowing.
So is your love.

911
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:43,458
Now, stop tattooing my
heart with your love.

912
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:47,083
Let me get into your heart.
So wait

913
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:50,875
My dear. Oh my dear.
Come to me.

914
00:43:57,292 --> 00:44:00,625
My dear flower. My dear birdie.

915
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:04,000
My dear peanut brittle.
My dear sugar candy.

916
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:07,542
Stop tattooing my heart
with your love.

917
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:11,000
Let me get into your heart.
So wait

918
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:15,375
My dear. Oh my dear. Come to me.

919
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:38,917
My dear. Oh my dear. Come to me.

920
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:42,333
My dear. Oh my dear.
Oh my dear love.

921
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:45,542
My dear. Oh my dear. Come to me.

922
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:49,375
My dear. Oh my dear.
Oh my dear love.

923
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:55,208
Now what's this?

924
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:58,125
Naina didn't you
question my abilities?

925
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,125
Now look. I've found
a brilliant fellow.

926
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:02,750
(Speaks Gibberish)

927
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:06,625
(Speaks Gibberish)

928
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,250
Now what was that leader?

929
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:10,750
Like I said the groom I've
found is on a whole new level.

930
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,125
What are you looking at Naina?

931
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,042
Look at our find.

932
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:16,667
What's with the certificate?

933
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:19,500
It's the procedure before
showing a footage.

934
00:45:19,542 --> 00:45:21,333
We got a school kid's certificate.

935
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:23,875
Check it out. The conduct
is marked as bad.

936
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,875
Come on applaud.

937
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,417
Cinematography by Ondi Puli.

938
00:45:30,417 --> 00:45:31,292
Superb!

939
00:45:31,417 --> 00:45:33,375
This year the best camera
man award is mine.

940
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,042
Naina 2016.

941
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:37,667
There'll be a little issue with
the brightness. Kindly adjust.

942
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:39,417
Check out the
introduction scene.

943
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:41,750
Come on! Awesome! Check it out.

944
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:44,042
Look at him wield the knife.

945
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:45,292
Johnny...

946
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:47,250
He is a massive don.

947
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,000
Crimes should be committed.

948
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,000
But only we should
commit those crimes.

949
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:56,667
What a dialogue delivery!

950
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:01,542
Finally the director's
name will appear.

951
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:06,667
Did you say his name was Johnny?

952
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:08,125
There. When you said Johnny...

953
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:10,458
I could hear the
'Great Bahubali'

954
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:12,625
Ok wait outside.

955
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:13,500
Outside?

956
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:14,750
What is he going to do?

957
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:15,292
Subbiah.

958
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,125
Yes Doss.

959
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,458
What do you think?

960
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:20,083
Doss do you know who is that?

961
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:23,292
Benjamin's son.

962
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:29,708
Bring him.

963
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,292
(Speaks Gibberish)

964
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:33,875
Mummy. Mummy.

965
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,167
Mummy.

966
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,333
Stop yelling like a beggar.

967
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,208
Yes, what do you want?

968
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:39,333
Where is the slayer?

969
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:40,958
Slayer?

970
00:46:41,042 --> 00:46:42,792
Oh you mean the butcher?

971
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:44,417
The third house from here.

972
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:46,167
- Tell me sister.
- Mummy!

973
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:49,375
I meant your son. Is
Johnny available?

974
00:46:49,917 --> 00:46:51,208
That useless fellow?

975
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:54,708
He'll be sitting and torturing someone
at the tea shop over there.

976
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:59,167
You hear that. Torturing is
like a child's play for him.

977
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:00,833
Johnny is on to a
whole new level.

978
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:03,125
Hold on.

979
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:05,417
Why are you looking for Johnny?

980
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:07,792
Naina ordered to get him.

981
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,125
God blessing mummy.

982
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,625
Why is he looking for him?

983
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,625
I don't know if she is my
friend or girl friend.

984
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,542
She asks me to book corner
seats in a theatre.

985
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:18,875
But then she places the
popcorn in between.

986
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:20,917
She asks me to take
her on a long drive.

987
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:23,000
But she places her
hand bag in between.

988
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:24,417
She put hers arm around.

989
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:26,250
But when I question she
says I am her bestie.

990
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,625
It's confusing.

991
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:28,792
But one thing.

992
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:33,083
Off late count of those who die over confusion
in love is more than that of love failures.

993
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:37,708
Why don't you use the same tongue
that blurted out all this to...

994
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:39,917
to tell her 'I LOVE YOU'?

995
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:41,333
What do you think will happen?

996
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:42,542
They will accept it for now.

997
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:48,250
Then finally after everything, to fulfill
their parent's wish they'll leave us.

998
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:50,375
Your girl's father?

999
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:51,750
I inquired about him.

1000
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,958
He is from Royapuram.

1001
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,917
Middle class family.

1002
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:56,250
People over there mock at him.

1003
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:57,583
Timid fellow.

1004
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,333
So you say we'll deal with him directly.

1005
00:47:59,375 --> 00:47:59,958
Yes.

1006
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:01,417
My brother has a friend.

1007
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,083
Royapuram is under his control.

1008
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:04,750
If we inform him...

1009
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:07,417
he'll knock down your girl's
dad and force him to accept.

1010
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:08,958
Who is he?

1011
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:10,500
I wish to see him.

1012
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:11,625
I haven't met him.

1013
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:13,167
I have heard a lot about him.

1014
00:48:13,167 --> 00:48:14,583
His name is Ondi Puli.

1015
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,125
The 'Lonely Tiger'

1016
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:21,792
Hello?

1017
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:25,042
- Puli here.
- This is Suresh's friend Glory.

1018
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:27,000
Make it quick.

1019
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:28,667
I'm in middle of a murder.

1020
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,833
Half of the knife has pierced in.
Rest is outside.

1021
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,083
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1022
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:33,292
Is it regarding
your friend's love?

1023
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:36,917
One of my friend is in love
with a girl in your area.

1024
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:39,375
He fears that her dad
might not accept it.

1025
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,042
I'll thrash her dad
and destroy him.

1026
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:44,167
What's her dad's name?

1027
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:45,458
Some silly name.

1028
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:49,125
Loose. No Bose.
No no, it's Doss.

1029
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:49,917
Doss?

1030
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:50,833
Yes.

1031
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:52,500
What's the girl's name?

1032
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,000
Her name too is something silly.

1033
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:54,792
Hema.

1034
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:55,792
Hema?

1035
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:57,458
Where are you guys now?

1036
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,625
At the tea shop.

1037
00:48:58,750 --> 00:48:59,542
Stay right there.

1038
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,833
How does it look? Positive?

1039
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:04,458
We are on the search
for that guy.

1040
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:07,000
But here someone else is in
love with our boss' daughter.

1041
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,958
(Speaks Gibberish)

1042
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,208
Let's finish him off first
and then look for our groom.

1043
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:15,417
Warm up.

1044
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:18,833
Leader...

1045
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,542
His hand will be in the sewer.

1046
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,292
Leg will be on the ground.

1047
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:24,583
I'll hand you only his body.

1048
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:25,542
Sounds good?

1049
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:30,750
(Speaks Gibberish)

1050
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:31,750
What?

1051
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:32,875
Go get him.

1052
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:34,375
Bless me 'Finger'

1053
00:49:34,917 --> 00:49:35,542
Thank you.

1054
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:39,333
Hey, don't let me go alone.
Now join me.

1055
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:41,417
I'll finish him off.

1056
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:58,333
Johnny bhai!

1057
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:02,792
I swear by my ancestors.

1058
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,458
I am not here to finish you off.

1059
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:05,917
Why is he calling
me bhai (don) ?

1060
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:07,125
I told you don't grow beard.

1061
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:08,667
Now look what it has led to?

1062
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:11,625
I can smell the blood.

1063
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,958
Black tea. Just like Naina.

1064
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,958
Don, chief asked us to get you.

1065
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:24,375
Let's go to Royapuram.

1066
00:50:24,875 --> 00:50:26,333
That's Ondi Puli for you.

1067
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:28,542
Come on. Let's go.

1068
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:36,042
Please you first.

1069
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:39,000
- No, please you get in.
- Please get in don.

1070
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:42,625
Long live Johnny bhai.

1071
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:43,917
Long live Johnny bhai.

1072
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,542
Long live Johnny bhai.

1073
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:00,625
Look at the respect for
Ondi Puli's friend.

1074
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:01,375
Please get in.

1075
00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:02,417
Imagine how it would
be for Ondi Puli.

1076
00:51:02,417 --> 00:51:04,208
Awesome! Who is he?

1077
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:06,583
I wish to see him.

1078
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:08,542
Whose house are we at?

1079
00:51:08,542 --> 00:51:09,333
Naina's house.

1080
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:11,083
You mean the girl's house?

1081
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:12,375
Fine.

1082
00:51:14,292 --> 00:51:15,750
You said it was a
middle class family.

1083
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:16,792
Look at the house.

1084
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:18,042
Must have rented for lease.

1085
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:22,750
Check it out dude.

1086
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:25,125
Your father in law
looks very timid.

1087
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,375
Looks like it's true.

1088
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:30,208
Please do put in a
word to Ondi Puli.

1089
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:32,000
I hope he doesn't hurt her dad.

1090
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:34,125
After all he is my
future father in law.

1091
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,042
Ondi Puli is too nasty.

1092
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,917
He has already sent
his men with weapons.

1093
00:51:43,042 --> 00:51:44,542
Look at him. He looks scared.

1094
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:45,500
Greetings.

1095
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:46,875
Hi. Have a seat.

1096
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:48,542
Guess he is a chicken.

1097
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,125
- Look at his attitude Naina.
- This is now my area.

1098
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:56,792
Is it? Now check this.
That's mine.

1099
00:51:57,083 --> 00:51:59,917
Now even up to Kanyakumari
it'll be under our control.

1100
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:02,333
Done. Now here is my move.

1101
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,125
Are you Johnny?

1102
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:07,792
Are you Doss?

1103
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,333
That's Benjamin's blood.

1104
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:14,417
I heard it from the guys. About
the incident at Jai Nagar hostel.

1105
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:15,125
Incident?

1106
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:17,125
He means about our visit
to his daughter's hostel.

1107
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:17,750
Is it?

1108
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,792
That's not the first incident.

1109
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:22,167
The first one was at a
garment shop in darkness.

1110
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:24,250
The same day another incident
at Ice cream parlour.

1111
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:26,417
Next incident was on the
streets when it was raining.

1112
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:29,083
The most recent being at ECR.

1113
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:29,917
Then at a theatre.

1114
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:31,208
That's enough dear.

1115
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:32,500
Subbiah.

1116
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,458
Kids these days are
well advanced.

1117
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,250
He is fast.

1118
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:37,750
I don't know to beat
around the bush.

1119
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:39,208
She is my only daughter.

1120
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:40,750
Will you marry her?

1121
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,542
That's Ondi Puli's
magic for you.

1122
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:44,208
He must have forced
him to say that.

1123
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,875
Who is he? I wish to see him.

1124
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:51,250
Since you are compelling.
I'm fine with it.

1125
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:52,958
But still just talk
to my mom once.

1126
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:54,375
To your mom?

1127
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:57,583
Fine, Let me try convincing her
atleast for this marriage.

1128
00:52:57,917 --> 00:52:59,125
Your agree to this right?

1129
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:00,292
Cool.

1130
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:01,917
I agree.

1131
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:04,333
I agree. I agree.

1132
00:53:04,417 --> 00:53:05,750
What are you doing you idiot?

1133
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:07,833
The groom is here. What in
the hell are you doing?

1134
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:08,875
Go get coffee.

1135
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:10,958
Poor fellow dude.

1136
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:13,167
We should recommend
for him to Ondi Puli.

1137
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:16,375
Before that call Ondi Puli and
say that the marriage is fixed.

1138
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:17,833
Why are you so slow?

1139
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,917
Make it quick you pig!

1140
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:21,167
Here you go.

1141
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:29,083
How dare you spill coffee over groom's
friend. What if it had spilled on the groom?

1142
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:31,708
They are torturing him too much. We
must recommend for him to Ondi Puli.

1143
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,250
That is Ondi Puli dude. The
one who is getting beaten up.

1144
00:53:35,042 --> 00:53:36,958
What? Ondi Puli is the
one getting beaten up?

1145
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:38,833
Who is the one beating him up?

1146
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:40,667
Dear groom.

1147
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:49,292
45 ml for the groom.

1148
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:52,458
Pour 90 ml for the
groom you fool.

1149
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:53,042
90 ml?

1150
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:56,917
The way you executed
Sekar was awesome!

1151
00:53:57,583 --> 00:53:58,708
Which Sekar?

1152
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:00,917
He must have finished
off many Sekars.

1153
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:03,875
What kind of question
is that Naina?

1154
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:04,917
Listen to me dear.

1155
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:07,625
Remember we were standing near
that hostel with weapons.

1156
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:09,583
You snatched the security's
weapon and finished off Sekar?

1157
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:11,083
Security's weapon?

1158
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:12,958
Dear father in law.

1159
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:15,583
It's getting late. I
need to inform mom.

1160
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:17,042
I'll make a call and be back.

1161
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,500
Please go ahead.

1162
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,542
Don't leave me alone here.

1163
00:54:19,542 --> 00:54:20,042
Doss...

1164
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:22,083
Though he is a rogue,

1165
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:24,500
check him turn soft at
the name of his mother.

1166
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:26,500
He is the perfect
affectionate rogue.

1167
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:29,375
There is hardly any balance in
the mobile to make a call.

1168
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:32,083
What was your name dear? Some Pullai....

1169
00:54:32,417 --> 00:54:33,167
Kovilpullai.

1170
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,250
Kovilpullai.

1171
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:36,917
You look dark and graceful.

1172
00:54:36,917 --> 00:54:38,292
My pleasure.

1173
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,917
He our groom's sidekick.

1174
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:40,417
Is it?

1175
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:42,875
He accompanies our groom
everywhere and for everything.

1176
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:44,750
I've never done anything before!

1177
00:54:44,917 --> 00:54:48,042
Just like how I am your sidekick.
He is our groom's sidekick.

1178
00:54:49,167 --> 00:54:52,333
Then let's get him married to
'Aarukola' Aarmugam's daughter.

1179
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:52,833
Why not?

1180
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:54,083
But isn't that my girl?

1181
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,292
Why is he crying?

1182
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,667
Tears of joy Doss.

1183
00:54:57,792 --> 00:54:59,583
I too shall talk to
my mom and be back.

1184
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:03,667
Dear, where are you?

1185
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,083
You said he was timid
and middle class.

1186
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:08,083
How about jumping from here?

1187
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:12,125
Greetings you beasts!

1188
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:15,125
- He waved at me.
- No, he waved at me.

1189
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:21,583
They aren't rogues.

1190
00:55:21,792 --> 00:55:22,917
They are psychopaths!

1191
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:26,083
Let's make it through the night.
We'll escape tomorrow.

1192
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:27,833
I need my Hema.

1193
00:55:27,917 --> 00:55:29,167
I need my life.

1194
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:30,417
Please help me.

1195
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:32,250
If I tell them that
I am not a rogue...

1196
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:33,833
they'll slit me
and eat me alive.

1197
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:34,625
Yes absolutely.

1198
00:55:34,917 --> 00:55:37,958
Let's try and get me married to Hema
some how and then escape from here.

1199
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:40,583
Dear, what is it taking so
long to discuss with your mom?

1200
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:41,333
I'm coming.

1201
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:42,833
Dear groom...

1202
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:44,875
you shouldn't have
hid the truth.

1203
00:55:47,417 --> 00:55:48,750
I think they found out.

1204
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:51,750
They are going to chop you down.

1205
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:55,042
Looks like you and my
daughter are already friends.

1206
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:59,792
They are too slow. Look
at their latest finding.

1207
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,833
If you marry my daughter, me and the
whole of Royapuram will rejoice.

1208
00:56:04,042 --> 00:56:06,083
I am not aware of what
my daughter wants.

1209
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:07,625
Does she like you?

1210
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,833
That's the same
confusion I have.

1211
00:56:10,042 --> 00:56:11,292
Don't you love him?

1212
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:13,458
Then what's stopping you?
Go tell him.

1213
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:17,958
No matter how big gangster he is,
how can I go tell him this.

1214
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,542
Then I'll lose the upperhand.

1215
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:21,792
Thing won't fall in place
like this for everyone.

1216
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:27,042
Though he is a rogue he has cute
face with chubby cheeks.

1217
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:29,083
Don't you call him chubby.

1218
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:31,667
Only I have the rights to
call him chubby cheeks.

1219
00:56:32,542 --> 00:56:33,250
It's dad.

1220
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:34,292
Go ahead.

1221
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:34,833
Hello.

1222
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,958
Tell me dad.

1223
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:36,917
Dear...

1224
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:38,542
I've found a groom for you.

1225
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:39,542
What are you saying?

1226
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:41,542
That's what. I have
found you a groom.

1227
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,000
Tomorrow morning we are
going to the groom's house.

1228
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,208
We are getting you engaged.

1229
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:46,583
Dad there is a guy.

1230
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:48,792
Not one guy. Invite
all your friends.

1231
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,083
Morning 6 a.m I'll send the car to pick
you up. I hope you've no complaints.

1232
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:52,875
No, dad...

1233
00:56:52,917 --> 00:56:53,917
So no complaints.

1234
00:56:54,042 --> 00:56:56,125
I knew it. Ok dear good night.

1235
00:56:56,167 --> 00:56:57,500
Daddy. Hello.

1236
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,042
My dad has gone crazy.

1237
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,417
He says he has found a groom.

1238
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:03,375
He says the engagement
is tomorrow.

1239
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:04,750
Is that what the crazy guy said?

1240
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:07,208
Only I can call my dad crazy.

1241
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:08,625
Don't you call him crazy.

1242
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,000
I am deeply in love with him.

1243
00:57:11,292 --> 00:57:13,458
I can see him everywhere.

1244
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:15,875
Now that's a cliche.

1245
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:20,542
Sorry.

1246
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,208
Even I can see him.

1247
00:57:24,042 --> 00:57:24,667
Hello.

1248
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:26,250
Yep it's me chubby cheeks.

1249
00:57:26,542 --> 00:57:27,833
I'm visible to everyone.

1250
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,333
Dear groom? Everything looks good?

1251
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:32,458
All set! All set!

1252
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,750
Light up the fireworks.

1253
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:41,958
Look here Johnny.

1254
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,625
You don't know about him.

1255
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:46,875
He chased away your dad
from that locality.

1256
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:48,833
He did run away from here
and landed up in prison.

1257
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,250
Now is he responsible
for that too?

1258
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:51,542
Forget the past aunty.

1259
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:54,292
I'll take care of your
son just like you.

1260
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,708
If you don't like me...

1261
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:57,250
then that's a valid reason.

1262
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:58,083
Not that dear.

1263
00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:01,125
You don't know his problems.

1264
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:03,250
I know aunty.

1265
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:04,542
His anger.

1266
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:05,708
Anger?

1267
00:58:06,542 --> 00:58:08,000
Raising hell for small issues.

1268
00:58:08,042 --> 00:58:09,208
Raising hell?

1269
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:13,125
I'll take care of it.

1270
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:14,917
You just have to agree.

1271
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
This won't work out.

1272
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:16,917
Dhanam...

1273
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:18,250
Brother.

1274
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:20,125
Brother?

1275
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,250
Atleast let this lovers unite.

1276
00:58:30,917 --> 00:58:33,042
What's your name dear
daughter in law?

1277
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:33,750
Hema.

1278
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:37,375
But my nickname is Dhanam.
That's how my dad calls me.

1279
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:39,833
He hasn't changed a bit.

1280
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,333
Oops! That's embarrassing.

1281
00:58:42,542 --> 00:58:43,625
Subbiah.

1282
00:58:43,875 --> 00:58:44,875
Where are you?

1283
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:46,250
Doss is everything fine?

1284
00:58:46,542 --> 00:58:47,667
Everything is almost set.

1285
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:51,625
25 years ago, you
couldn't impress her...

1286
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:52,000
Shut up.

1287
00:58:52,042 --> 00:58:54,542
Love is not the flower
that blossoms in a plant.

1288
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,583
It's the color that
blossoms in the heart.

1289
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:02,083
This is the right time...

1290
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:03,458
to finish off Doss.

1291
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:06,833
Dance with me. Dance with me.
Dance with me oh my dear.

1292
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:10,083
Get down on the dance floor
and dance with me dear.

1293
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:13,250

Just like two souls and one heart;
Come dance with me oh my dear.

00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:19,708

00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,875

Just like two souls and one heart;
Come dance with me oh my dear.

00:59:29,417 --> 00:59:32,208
My birdie oh dear birdie.
 Flap your wings and flatter me.

1300
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:35,417
Tie me onto your heart.
Shower me with your love.

1301
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:38,583
Come to me now.
Pour me your love.

1302
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:41,917
My mind is on to something.
It's time for us to love.

1303
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Love is crazy. It
won't let you sleep.

1304
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:48,208
Royapuram groom is here!

1305
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,542
Dance with me. Dance with me.
Dance with me oh my dear.

1306
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:54,750
Get down on the dance floor
and dance with me dear.

1307
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:58,000
Let's forget ourselves
and dance my dear.

1308
00:59:58,083 --> 01:00:01,250
Just like two souls and one heart;
Come dance with me oh my dear.

01:00:04,542 --> 01:00:07,583
Get down on the dance floor

1311
01:00:07,667 --> 01:00:10,833
Let's forget ourselves
and dance my dear.

1312
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:14,208
Just like two souls and one heart;
Come dance with me oh my dear.

1313
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:16,417
How long are you going
to be a side kick?

1314
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:58,292
Your looks are killing me.

1315
01:00:58,542 --> 01:01:01,500
You touch is charging me up.

1316
01:01:01,667 --> 01:01:04,667
The rarest of flower, that even
the flowers have never heard of.

1317
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:07,917
Your are way out of my league.

1318
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:11,458
It's time to love my dear.

1319
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:14,458
Time to shower each other
with love and kisses.

1320
01:01:14,542 --> 01:01:17,667
Time to turn off the shyness.

1321
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,917
Time for the honey moon.

1322
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,042
Don't look at me with those eyes...

1323
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:27,167
It's taking me high
and making me dance.

1324
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,500
I can't control myself anymore.

1325
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:33,667
Now come pamper me.

1326
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:38,500
Dance with me. Dance with me.
Dance with me oh my dear.

1327
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:41,708
Get down on the dance floor
and dance with me dear.

1328
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:44,875
Let's forget ourselves
and dance my dear.

1329
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,125
Just like two souls and one heart;
Come dance with me oh my dear.

1330
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,792
What is it?

1331
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:29,250
Are you sad that Naina didn't
marry his daughter off to you?

1332
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,333
Nothing like that.

1333
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:33,083
Then why are you
here at this hour?

1334
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:34,375
To finish you off.

1335
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:36,750
Are you drunk?

1336
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:39,208
I said I am going
to finish you off.

1337
01:02:39,417 --> 01:02:40,583
You think it's a joke.

1338
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:53,417
Mom.

1339
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:54,667
Wait. I'm coming.

1340
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,250
How long should I wait?

1341
01:02:58,833 --> 01:02:59,625
What is it?

1342
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:01,042
Why are you tensed?

1343
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:02,542
Only 4 hours to go.

1344
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,042
You can get in at 2 O clock.

1345
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:06,083
Why wait for auspicious time?

1346
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:08,958
Fine, all my friends are partying.
I'll go meet them and come.

1347
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,750
Hold on.

1348
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:11,583
- Don't go. Only 4 hours to go.
- Shut up.

1349
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:12,208
Silly!

1350
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:13,500
Don't go.

1351
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:17,417
Here after everything our
groom will look after.

1352
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:19,333
- Where to groom?
- Anything urgent?

1353
01:03:19,417 --> 01:03:20,917
I'm just going nearby.
I'll be back.

1354
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:21,667
Fine.

1355
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:23,667
Be careful.

1356
01:03:23,792 --> 01:03:25,292
Where is he going at this hour?

1357
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,125
- He must be bored.
- Oh fine.

1358
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:28,000
He'll return soon.

1359
01:03:29,292 --> 01:03:29,875
Tell me bhai.

1360
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:31,458
You have left a trail Doss.

1361
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,917
Why did you let him go?

1362
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:35,167
What are you saying?

1363
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,167
You shouldn't have done it.

1364
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:40,083
You left him stranded.

1365
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:40,667
Bhai!

1366
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:44,000
What is it Doss?

1367
01:03:44,792 --> 01:03:47,125
Someone has finished off bhai. I'll
just go and check at the society hall.

1368
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:49,333
- Why don't you take few men?
- No need.

1369
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,042
Myle. Someone just finished
off Hussain bhai.

1370
01:04:08,917 --> 01:04:09,542
Sami...

1371
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:12,458
someone has crafted out a plan
and is finishing of our men.

1372
01:04:12,542 --> 01:04:13,875
They have got me too Naina.

1373
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,583
They are here Naina.

1374
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:17,958
Damn! Who in the hell are you?

1375
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:27,208
It's Velu's son Naina.

1376
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,583
I'll find you and kill you!

1377
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:34,542
I'm coming next to meet you.

1378
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:55,792
Can you drop me at
Royapuram society hall?

1379
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:56,875
Can you give me a lift.

1380
01:04:56,917 --> 01:04:57,708
Hop on brother.

1381
01:04:58,875 --> 01:05:00,417
Brother, do you have a mobile?

1382
01:05:00,792 --> 01:05:01,458
I do.

1383
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:04,917
Groom?

1384
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:14,042
Do you know my name?

1385
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:17,458
Durai.

1386
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:19,333
My name is Johnny.

1387
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:21,167
I just got married today.

1388
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:22,792
It's been so stressful!

1389
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:25,208
Now, being a part of
this gangster family...

1390
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:26,750
I am hearing lot of stuffs!

1391
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:33,083
Looks like Naina is calling me.
I'll be back.

1392
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:35,583
Where to?

1393
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:37,625
- Naina is on his way.
- Shut up! No need.

1394
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:40,125
Here after I'll go.

1395
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:42,167
He is no more the Naina.

1396
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:12,667
Brother.

1397
01:06:13,042 --> 01:06:14,917
Please do not reveal
whatever I was pondering.

1398
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:06,958
That's my throne.

1399
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:09,833
Looking you all alone...

1400
01:07:10,667 --> 01:07:12,917
reminds me of my childhood.

1401
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:17,958
Do you think someone will
come to save you now Doss?

1402
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:55,917
Do I look like a fool?

1403
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:01,542
Didn't you borrow my mobile?

1404
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:02,542
Won't you return it?

1405
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:04,583
Give it to me now.

1406
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:09,667
What is it?

1407
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:11,792
Any issue?

1408
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,167
It's getting late.

1409
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:15,167
I'll leave.

1410
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:16,250
Bye.

1411
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:17,250
Bye.

1412
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:18,417
Bye.

1413
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:32,042
I am the next Naina!

1414
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:39,042
I am the next Naina!

1415
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:45,917
I am the next Naina!

1416
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:47,833
That's my son in law!

1417
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:50,000
Now that's my son in law.

1418
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:55,000
I am the next Naina!

1419
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,583
I am the next Naina!

1420
01:08:58,958 --> 01:08:59,958
I am the next Naina!

1421
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:02,958
I am the next Naina.

1422
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:05,875
What the hell? Damn it!

1423
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:08,250
I am the next Naina!

1424
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:11,333
Go finish him off.

1425
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:13,333
I am the next Naina!

1426
01:09:16,417 --> 01:09:18,167
- I am the next Naina!
- Come on dear.

1427
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:42,875
I hope you would
have understood.

1428
01:09:43,333 --> 01:09:44,833
Going forward, harbour
is in Gobi's control.

1429
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:46,042
Start handing over
the money to us.

1430
01:09:46,042 --> 01:09:48,000
Here after we'll be ruling here.

1431
01:09:48,292 --> 01:09:50,375
What? Do you feel that
we are too young?

1432
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:51,792
We are young and sharp.

1433
01:09:51,917 --> 01:09:53,292
I'm going to compete for the MLA
seat in the upcoming election.

1434
01:09:53,417 --> 01:09:54,167
Don't expect money for votes.

1435
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:54,708
Listen...

1436
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:56,042
come here.

1437
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:57,667
Where is Naina?

1438
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:00,000
The one who sits
here is Naina right?

1439
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:01,708
Ain't I sitting on the chair?

1440
01:10:02,167 --> 01:10:03,458
We won't require tea anymore.

1441
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:04,250
Leave.

1442
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:08,292
Do you think you can control the
area with the small time rogues?

1443
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,333
Stop raising your voice.

1444
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,042
Stop showing off.

1445
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,833
I'm sparing you because
I need your vote.

1446
01:10:18,042 --> 01:10:19,000
Do you understand?

1447
01:10:24,042 --> 01:10:25,458
Dad, where is Naina?

1448
01:10:25,875 --> 01:10:26,958
Naina has been attacked.

1449
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:29,167
He has left.

1450
01:10:29,542 --> 01:10:30,708
Where is he now?

1451
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:32,833
Sister, this man has
made it a habit.

1452
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:35,208
Every month he get's attacked
and gets bed ridden.

1453
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:37,625
I guess it's our fate.

1454
01:10:37,917 --> 01:10:38,458
Forget that.

1455
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:41,542
What is with the groom repeating
what he hears when he sees blood?

1456
01:10:41,792 --> 01:10:42,375
Yes.

1457
01:10:42,417 --> 01:10:43,917
I've been to all the
doctors around.

1458
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:44,958
Nothing worked out.

1459
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:46,208
Isn't it good?

1460
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,042
Atleast the groom will
be away from violence.

1461
01:10:48,083 --> 01:10:49,917
My daughter's life
will be peaceful.

1462
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:50,750
Hey Puli.

1463
01:10:52,042 --> 01:10:53,083
What is it? Tell me.

1464
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,458
Go give him this juice.

1465
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:55,542
No. Stop feeding him this.

1466
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:57,042
He ain’t back from
work and tired.

1467
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:58,042
He is back after
getting attacked.

1468
01:10:58,125 --> 01:10:58,875
I said go give it.

1469
01:10:58,917 --> 01:10:59,875
Hold on. Let me test it.

1470
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:03,375
Don't you know he is diabetic.

1471
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:05,042
It's too sweet. It
could kill him.

1472
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,583
That's for the groom.

1473
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:07,792
Oh is it?

1474
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:09,333
Let's the move.

1475
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:26,000
Naina.

1476
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:27,250
Naina.

1477
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:28,500
Oh my god! Naina!

1478
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:29,958
Phew!

1479
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:31,500
My wishes never come true.

1480
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:33,375
- What is it?
- Here, have some juice.

1481
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:34,583
No.

1482
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:36,750
This is a special juice.
It's for the groom.

1483
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:38,167
He saved you yesterday night.

1484
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:40,042
So you better have
the sweet lime.

1485
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:41,333
Keep the juice aside.

1486
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,917
Give me a hand.

1487
01:11:43,042 --> 01:11:43,792
And now this!

1488
01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:46,875
Do you want to use
the restroom Naina?

1489
01:11:46,917 --> 01:11:48,208
Shall I get the bed pen?

1490
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:50,833
No thanks. Just
take me till there.

1491
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:52,250
Near the window?
It'll be disgusting.

1492
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:53,208
Why not the restroom?

1493
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:54,083
Forget that.

1494
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:56,458
I heard that 15 of them
rounded you up yesterday?

1495
01:11:56,667 --> 01:11:57,667
Our men told me.

1496
01:11:57,792 --> 01:12:01,250
Lucky you, Johnny was there
to face them and save you.

1497
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:03,458
Or else you would've been
done for now.

1498
01:12:03,542 --> 01:12:04,625
What a gangster, he is.

1499
01:12:04,917 --> 01:12:07,125
Wasn't it you along with others
selected him for my daughter?

1500
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:08,375
Naina, why doubt?

1501
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,083
Not us.

1502
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:12,042
It was me the lonely tiger.
Ondi Puli!

1503
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:15,208
You may want to gift me.
I don't care.

1504
01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:17,208
Come here you doofus.

1505
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,875
I asked you to find a groom
and you found a patient.

1506
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:21,375
- Die!
- Why punish me alone?

1507
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:22,750
I am just the cameraman.

1508
01:12:23,292 --> 01:12:26,167
If you dare, try laying your hands
on our director 'Finger' Babu.

1509
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:27,083
Where is he?

1510
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,417
There he is.

1511
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:29,625
Hi guys.

1512
01:12:29,917 --> 01:12:30,667
What's up?

1513
01:12:30,708 --> 01:12:31,250
Naina...

1514
01:12:31,583 --> 01:12:33,625
here is your punching bag.

1515
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:34,167
Leave me.

1516
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:37,417
Why in the hell are
you hugging him?

1517
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,500
Doesn't his hair prick you?

1518
01:12:38,542 --> 01:12:40,250
He wasn't hugging me doofus.
He almost killed me.

1519
01:12:40,292 --> 01:12:41,375
Now I understand.

1520
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:45,375
You are proud that we found a groom
who saved your life. Isn't it?

1521
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,875
He merely shot him
with his camera.

1522
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:52,083
I was the one to identify the groom.

1523
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:55,542
And if you are hugging him
and praising him then...

1524
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:59,125
I guess you must be planning to
go one step ahead and kiss me.

1525
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:00,875
I will. Come here.

1526
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:01,708
I'm coming.

1527
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:03,792
Naina, carry on.

1528
01:13:05,292 --> 01:13:08,208
Stop being greedy.

1529
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:11,750
He will appreciate me more
that what he appreciated you.

1530
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:12,917
What do you say Naina?

1531
01:13:12,917 --> 01:13:13,625
Why not?

1532
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:14,583
Now who's greedy?

1533
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:15,667
I said all the best.

1534
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:16,542
Now get out.

1535
01:13:17,417 --> 01:13:18,542
Naina he is all yours.

1536
01:13:19,042 --> 01:13:21,042
So what did you hear when I
called out his name?

1537
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:23,917
No matter how many times you ask.
The answer is same.

1538
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,708
I hear 'King Bahubali'.

1539
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:27,625
Ofcourse.

1540
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:30,375
What is that you keep
praising about him?

1541
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:39,833
Our groom is on to
a whole new level.

1542
01:13:40,042 --> 01:13:42,083
I don't want to see what
you are going to receive.

1543
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:43,625
RIP 'Finger' Babu.

1544
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,208
Naina, take care.

1545
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:52,458
You are a goner 'Finger' Babu.

1546
01:13:55,167 --> 01:13:57,125
Did he have his juice?

1547
01:13:57,708 --> 01:13:59,375
He has just started
the squeezing.

1548
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,625
What place is this?

1549
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:12,125
Why am I waking up here?

1550
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:14,542
You dad is disgusting!

1551
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:16,417
He got me tangled in a big mess.

1552
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,292
For the first time in my life
I saw such a big knife.

1553
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,792
I am the reason he is alive.

1554
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:23,667
What are you looking at?

1555
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,583
Didn't you father
escape using my bike?

1556
01:14:25,917 --> 01:14:28,125
Well you don't have to fall
at my feet and thank me.

1557
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:31,083
I understand your anger.

1558
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:33,833
You are furious because we couldn't
spend our first day together.Isn't it?

1559
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:34,958
I don't have any problem.

1560
01:14:34,958 --> 01:14:36,250
First day. First show.

1561
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:37,583
I'll rock it!

1562
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:40,167
You have got beautiful hair.

1563
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:42,000
Why did you lie that
you are a rogue?

1564
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:44,292
Nisha...err. I mean Hema.

1565
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:45,958
How dare you cheat me?

1566
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
But why are you talking like
you have been possessed?

1567
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:50,167
Why me lord? Why me?

1568
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:52,250
How could you let
them attack my dad?

1569
01:14:52,417 --> 01:14:53,417
When did I allow?

1570
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:55,500
All that guy wanted was the throne.

1571
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:57,875
But your dad was over
reacting and not allowing.

1572
01:14:57,917 --> 01:14:59,000
And so he attacked him.

1573
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:00,708
I'm not the reason.

1574
01:15:01,625 --> 01:15:02,375
Come here.

1575
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:04,333
Liplock?

1576
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:06,417
How about closing the door?

1577
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:11,375
So you want me to lock the door?
Fine, I'll do that.

1578
01:15:12,917 --> 01:15:15,625
"Tonight is the night"

1579
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:18,625
"Time of my life"

1580
01:15:19,833 --> 01:15:22,417
No harsh approaches please.

1581
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:25,000
After all you are a patient.

1582
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:32,208
My vision has gone blur mom.

1583
01:15:33,792 --> 01:15:34,917
Listen Johnny.

1584
01:15:35,667 --> 01:15:36,708
What have you done?

1585
01:15:36,792 --> 01:15:38,292
I had fixed an
auspicious time but...

1586
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:39,708
what was the hurry?

1587
01:15:40,042 --> 01:15:42,375
If the hair looks like this
does it only mean that?

1588
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:44,625
Didn't you hear me yell inside?

1589
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:45,583
Shut up now.

1590
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,167
Why would want to hear all that?

1591
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:48,250
Stupid mom!

1592
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,667
I was getting beaten up.

1593
01:15:50,042 --> 01:15:52,000
During the night her dad
is fighting for the throne.

1594
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:54,458
During the day she fights
with me for her dad.

1595
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:56,292
Her family is full of rogues.

1596
01:15:56,417 --> 01:15:58,250
They don't fight with outsiders.

1597
01:15:58,375 --> 01:16:00,333
But they thrash who ever
comes to their house.

1598
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:02,625
I'm leaving. Are you coming?

1599
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:04,125
Well, Johnny...

1600
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:05,667
So you are not coming?

1601
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:07,500
I'm leaving.

1602
01:16:08,042 --> 01:16:08,750
Johnny.

1603
01:16:09,792 --> 01:16:10,625
Get lost!

1604
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:14,250
No one in Doss' family
should be alive.

1605
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:15,542
Round up the whole Chennai city.

1606
01:16:15,625 --> 01:16:17,167
First get hold of Johnny.

1607
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:18,583
If you get him, cut
him into pieces.

1608
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:20,208
Ensure he shouldn't
have any heir.

1609
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:22,000
Sounds gory!

1610
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,083
I think that's all that is left.

1611
01:16:30,167 --> 01:16:31,667
So are we in a hide out right now?

1612
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:32,625
Yes.

1613
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:36,708
We are hiding hear fearing that,
if caught we'll be finished off?

1614
01:16:37,917 --> 01:16:39,000
Whose idea was this?

1615
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,250
Naina's.

1616
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:42,792
So we'll be staying for the night
and escape tomorrow right?

1617
01:16:43,208 --> 01:16:44,208
No. Never.

1618
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:46,792
He vows to stay here and take back
the full control over Royapuram.

1619
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:48,000
What if he doesn't?

1620
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:50,500
Life or death. It's here. He says so.

1621
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:51,875
Only for him right?

1622
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:53,417
For everyone.

1623
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:54,000
Finish!

1624
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:55,292
I'll go get refreshed.

1625
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,500
Serve me some food.

1626
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:03,542
Where is Doss?

1627
01:17:03,542 --> 01:17:04,875
I don't know.

1628
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:07,208
I am here in the area.

1629
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,917
The stuff is ready.

1630
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:10,375
Three of them right?

1631
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,750
Let's be careful.

1632
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,958
The towel stinks! Yuck!

1633
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:22,583
Hello.

1634
01:17:23,167 --> 01:17:24,375
Anybody there?

1635
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:36,042
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1636
01:17:46,292 --> 01:17:48,292
Bhai, yesterday night,

1637
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:50,792
knowing that you were in the
mood for romance and...

1638
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:52,625
knowing that you
won't attack anyone,

1639
01:17:52,708 --> 01:17:54,625
- they attacked you.
- Correct Puli.

1640
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:55,875
- Fine.
- Correct.

1641
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:56,917
He is a 'Mischievous' Puli (tiger)...

1642
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:58,500
He is a 'Confused' Puli...

1643
01:17:58,542 --> 01:17:59,792
He is a 'African' Puli...

1644
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:00,792
He is a 'Ass' Puli...

1645
01:18:00,958 --> 01:18:02,042
He is a 'Discovery' Puli.

1646
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:03,792
He is a 'Fantasy' Puli.

1647
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:05,542
Enough. I am good.

1648
01:18:05,917 --> 01:18:06,625
Puli...

1649
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:08,542
pass me that snacks.

1650
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,000
Here, go to Johnny bhai.

1651
01:18:10,542 --> 01:18:11,958
Move. There is no time.

1652
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:14,625
We were so powerful
once upon a time.

1653
01:18:14,792 --> 01:18:18,208
Now we are forced to hide and
drink in the water tank.

1654
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:19,292
- Puli.
- Why?

1655
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:21,625
Everyone receives a call
during their toughest phase.

1656
01:18:21,792 --> 01:18:23,375
Attend it and we shall
be powerful once again.

1657
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:25,042
First attend that call.

1658
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:27,125
Tell me Glory.

1659
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:28,833
How may men are you bringing along?

1660
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:32,917
Me and my family are running
away from this place.

1661
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:37,875
If they catch me, it's still fine but
poor souls, my parents. What did they do?

1662
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:40,333
No don't bring 100 of them.

1663
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:44,000
I unable to bear my Dad
disguised as a Sikh!

1664
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:45,417
Spare us.

1665
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:48,375
Thank you Glory but we
ourselves will handle it.

1666
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,000
Here we have got Babu and Puli.

1667
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:53,292
We shall handle this ourselves.

1668
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:56,083
If Durai is dethroned it'll
solve the issue right?

1669
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:59,083
Now this sounds like the
issue is already dealt with!

1670
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:02,375
I swear by these
candle I've lit...

1671
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:05,042
We will finish him off.
Don! Don! Don!

1672
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:06,708
We'll finish him!

1673
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:07,917
We'll finish him!

1674
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:28,375
One two three four,
I am all set to go.

1675
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:31,542
I'm playing my cards right
to get you ready too!

1676
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:34,375
I am a bird singing
out to you...

1677
01:19:34,417 --> 01:19:37,167
Now take me along with you.

1678
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:40,417
Come on my love,
don't be so scared.

1679
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,250
Enough with your pranks,
now get up and get ready!

1680
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:22,042
Your anger rules the place.
Your speed earns you the reputation.

1681
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,833
How dare you touch me
without my permission?

1682
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:28,125
The way you dance,
the way you walk...

1683
01:20:28,167 --> 01:20:30,792
discovers new things within me.

1684
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:34,083
If you win this competition
I shall be yours.

1685
01:20:34,208 --> 01:20:37,042
But looks like already
you on your way down!

1686
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:40,125
Looks like your aimed it wrong.

1687
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:43,042
You are going down down!

1688
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:45,917
So listen to me carefully.

1689
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,917
I'm not that easy to break.
Try as hard you can!

1690
01:20:55,167 --> 01:20:58,375
One two three four,
I am all set to go.

1691
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:00,708
I'm playing my cards right
to get you ready too!

1692
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:04,083
I am a bird singing
out to you...

1693
01:21:04,167 --> 01:21:06,708
Now take me along with you.

1694
01:21:06,917 --> 01:21:10,000
Come on my love,
don't be so scared.

1695
01:21:10,042 --> 01:21:13,125
Enough with your pranks,
now get up and get ready!

1696
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:20,583
Now come!

1697
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:36,250
What is he thinking?

1698
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:38,583
This is the right time!

1699
01:21:38,667 --> 01:21:42,375
Johnny bhai. Let's think
it over once again.

1700
01:21:42,917 --> 01:21:44,833
Once decided; Stays decided.

1701
01:21:45,208 --> 01:21:46,208
- Give that to me.
- Here.

1702
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:53,042
We are doing it tonight.

1703
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:55,083
Johnny bhai! Don! Don! Don!

1704
01:21:55,167 --> 01:21:55,917
Don't shout.

1705
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:11,667
Naina.

1706
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:17,667
Chief, you won't believe this.

1707
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:40,500
Johnny bhai, it was for this throne...

1708
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:43,125
Doss finished Durai's father.

1709
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:47,750
It was for the same throne
Durai got rid of Doss.

1710
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:50,167
But you? You are on to a whole new level.

1711
01:22:50,208 --> 01:22:52,167
You just stole the throne.

1712
01:22:52,417 --> 01:22:54,625
As I said you are on to a
whole new level Johnny bhai.

1713
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:55,458
I got a doubt.

1714
01:22:55,917 --> 01:22:57,792
Do you know how drunk we are?

1715
01:22:57,958 --> 01:22:59,042
- Keep moving.
- Why?

1716
01:22:59,083 --> 01:22:59,708
Johnny bhai...

1717
01:23:00,417 --> 01:23:02,125
Let's sell it off at an auction.

1718
01:23:02,917 --> 01:23:04,417
You'll get nothing.

1719
01:23:04,667 --> 01:23:07,750
We shall sell it
overseas in online.

1720
01:23:07,792 --> 01:23:09,625
Is that why we got this?

1721
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:15,000
I challenge to make my father in law sit on this
throne and then I shall start my life with my wife.

1722
01:23:15,042 --> 01:23:15,708
Johnny bhai!

1723
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:17,958
Do you mean both
at the same time?

1724
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:21,250
I'll start my married life
with my wife separately!

1725
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:23,083
We too shall!

1726
01:23:23,125 --> 01:23:23,625
I will.

1727
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:24,875
Indeed but a small doubt.

1728
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:27,583
Do you know how drunk we are?

1729
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:31,542
Dear father in law.

1730
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:34,083
I've got your throne.
Open the door.

1731
01:23:34,583 --> 01:23:37,875
Johnny bhai. Don't you worry...

1732
01:23:37,917 --> 01:23:39,667
We can still sell it online.

1733
01:23:39,792 --> 01:23:40,792
What do you say?

1734
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:42,417
Hold on to that
idea for a moment.

1735
01:23:42,917 --> 01:23:44,875
Do you know how drunk we are?

1736
01:23:44,917 --> 01:23:46,708
How drunk are we? This drunk?

1737
01:23:46,917 --> 01:23:49,208
If I say that you'll
fight with me.

1738
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:51,875
Tell us or I'll anyway
fight with you.

1739
01:23:52,542 --> 01:23:54,250
We are so drunk that...

1740
01:23:54,458 --> 01:23:55,625
we have stole the throne...

1741
01:23:55,958 --> 01:23:57,708
and instead of taking to our hide out,

1742
01:23:57,792 --> 01:23:59,458
we have bought it back
to the original place.

1743
01:23:59,458 --> 01:24:00,833
So who will be here?

1744
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:04,083
Welcome to the assembly.

1745
01:24:04,667 --> 01:24:06,042
Good timing.

1746
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:07,667
Greetings.

1747
01:24:08,417 --> 01:24:09,208
Greetings.

1748
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:11,083
My mom is a timid lady.

1749
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:13,125
My dad is too a timid fellow.

1750
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:14,417
My brother too is
a timid fellow.

1751
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:17,375
Everything in this world
that belongs to me is timid!

1752
01:24:17,667 --> 01:24:19,958
That fool can believe whatever you say.

1753
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:21,958
But men behind will
never believe it.

1754
01:24:22,042 --> 01:24:26,042
Stop deceiving them.

1755
01:24:26,417 --> 01:24:28,542
Or they'll bust you up. Watch out.

1756
01:24:28,792 --> 01:24:30,500
What do you say?
Convey this to Durai?

1757
01:24:30,667 --> 01:24:32,083
Please don't.

1758
01:24:32,542 --> 01:24:34,458
Take the weapons, we'll
finish them off.

1759
01:24:35,958 --> 01:24:38,458
- Now that's the way!
- Our guys seems charged up!

1760
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:41,792
Hand over the weapon.

1761
01:24:44,167 --> 01:24:46,083
How about some fireworks?

1762
01:24:46,167 --> 01:24:47,417
Awesome baby!

1763
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:48,208
I'll take care.

1764
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,542
Where are you going?

1765
01:24:49,583 --> 01:24:50,208
Here.

1766
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,292
I haven't used it
since I bought it.

1767
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:53,583
Please put it to good use.

1768
01:24:54,208 --> 01:24:55,000
Done.

1769
01:24:56,167 --> 01:24:57,875
I meant hand it over to me.

1770
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
If I make up my mind once...

1771
01:25:00,667 --> 01:25:03,167
- it stays the same.
- Shut up!

1772
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:04,542
Stop it you pig!

1773
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:07,917
What's our plan B?

1774
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:10,042
Get thrashed by those bouncers.

1775
01:25:10,792 --> 01:25:14,125
There you go. Now
wait and watch.

1776
01:25:17,208 --> 01:25:19,625
Why does he show off so much?

1777
01:25:20,833 --> 01:25:22,958
Once I put the barricade...

1778
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:25,208
What will you do?

1779
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:27,667
How about a little escapade?

1780
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:28,833
- Run!
- Run!

1781
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:34,792
They are nearing us.

1782
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:35,750
Where did they go?

1783
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:37,208
You guys go that way.

1784
01:25:37,417 --> 01:25:40,583
Oh my god! Why are you making
me workout at this age?

1785
01:25:42,875 --> 01:25:43,417
Don!

1786
01:25:43,708 --> 01:25:45,083
Stop!

1787
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:47,083
You go this way.

1788
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:48,583
Puli you go this way.

1789
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:49,167
Ok Johnny.

1790
01:26:09,667 --> 01:26:11,000
Gotcha!

1791
01:26:15,958 --> 01:26:17,042
You are finished!

1792
01:26:28,792 --> 01:26:29,750
You leave dear.

1793
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:30,792
You go!

1794
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:33,208
I said leave dear.

1795
01:26:33,625 --> 01:26:35,542
Subbiah, don't waste you
life unnecessarily.

1796
01:26:37,083 --> 01:26:42,083
Did you think I escaped
away to save my life?

1797
01:26:42,458 --> 01:26:45,000
One day Doss will be back.

1798
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:47,333
And I was waiting for it.

1799
01:26:48,042 --> 01:26:49,083
Dear you leave.

1800
01:26:49,208 --> 01:26:50,167
Don't you near me.

1801
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,583
Subbiah, come we'll escape.

1802
01:26:53,167 --> 01:26:54,042
Why me?

1803
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:55,375
You should be there.

1804
01:26:55,583 --> 01:26:57,625
I am done.

1805
01:26:58,292 --> 01:26:59,125
No Subbiah.

1806
01:26:59,583 --> 01:27:01,083
Dear you leave!

1807
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,333
Listen to me don't you!

1808
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:04,708
Dear make it quick.

1809
01:27:04,792 --> 01:27:05,417
Finish him.

1810
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:08,833
I don't care what others say?

1811
01:27:09,083 --> 01:27:10,000
I believe.

1812
01:27:10,292 --> 01:27:11,500
You are the next Naina.

1813
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,458
You traitor!

1814
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:16,375
Why would you do this Subbiah?

1815
01:27:18,708 --> 01:27:20,708
I merely saved him.

1816
01:27:20,875 --> 01:27:22,708
I didn't betray anyone like you did.

1817
01:27:45,667 --> 01:27:48,208
I don't care what others say.
I believe.

1818
01:27:48,417 --> 01:27:50,667
You are the next Naina.

1819
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:01,458
Didn't you say...

1820
01:28:01,708 --> 01:28:03,708
that if Subbaih dies Doss
will definitely come out.

1821
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:06,250
Where is he?

1822
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:07,875
Come on Naina.

1823
01:28:08,458 --> 01:28:10,083
Only today I knew that he is a chicken!

1824
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:27,292
40 years of friendship.

1825
01:28:27,542 --> 01:28:29,833
Yet I had to witness his final
rites from the hide out.

1826
01:28:30,417 --> 01:28:31,083
Shanmugam.

1827
01:28:31,292 --> 01:28:33,292
If we need how many
henchmen will turn up?

1828
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:34,958
We shall finish
them off tonight.

1829
01:28:35,125 --> 01:28:36,542
It's not so easy Doss.

1830
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:38,208
All are youngsters.

1831
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:40,042
The whole area is
under his control.

1832
01:28:40,417 --> 01:28:41,667
It's not a walk in the park.

1833
01:28:42,167 --> 01:28:43,875
I was the one who
finished off his father.

1834
01:28:44,042 --> 01:28:45,708
But you weren't alone back then Doss.

1835
01:28:45,792 --> 01:28:47,375
So you want me to
bring back Bejamin?

1836
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:48,792
The area's condition is worse.

1837
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:52,375
Wasn't it Benjamin who crafted out
a plan to finish off his father?

1838
01:28:52,667 --> 01:28:55,458
If both of you unite. You can
definitely finish him off.

1839
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:59,500
I heard that Bejamin is soon
going to get released.

1840
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:02,375
So what? Will he join
me if I ask him?

1841
01:29:04,792 --> 01:29:06,625
I don't know how to fight.

1842
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:09,792
But all I can do is bring my father.

1843
01:29:11,417 --> 01:29:13,375
Serial number 786...

1844
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:15,125
Life sentenced prisoner.

1845
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,208
Benjamin has been released.

1846
01:29:17,333 --> 01:29:22,375
Happy birthday to me.

1847
01:29:22,417 --> 01:29:26,500
Happy birthday to me.

1848
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:34,833
May god bless you
with a long life.

1849
01:29:44,667 --> 01:29:45,875
My friend has been released.

1850
01:29:45,917 --> 01:29:47,167
Here he comes. Benjamin!

1851
01:29:47,917 --> 01:29:50,708
I don't know if he will recognize you.

1852
01:29:50,792 --> 01:29:53,542
But he'll definitely hug me and
shed tears the moment he sees me.

1853
01:29:53,708 --> 01:29:54,708
Don't you feel bad.

1854
01:29:55,625 --> 01:29:56,542
Dear Benj!

1855
01:29:59,042 --> 01:30:01,417
Don't you call me your father.

1856
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,000
Here after you have
to call me bro only.

1857
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,625
Who is he? Why is he crying?

1858
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:09,917
- Benj.
- What the hell?

1859
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:12,542
- Who are you?
- Don't you recognize me Benj?

1860
01:30:12,583 --> 01:30:13,667
Who is this old fellow?

1861
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:15,750
You said he'll identify you,
hug you and shed tears?

1862
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:18,958
Forget it. Just like I wished for...

1863
01:30:19,042 --> 01:30:23,958
I hope you might have become a
musician and a star by now.

1864
01:30:24,167 --> 01:30:27,375
No. I got married to Doss' daughter
and became the Royapuram Naina.

1865
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:28,750
You are the Naina?

1866
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:32,542
You achieved what I couldn't!

1867
01:30:32,583 --> 01:30:34,875
Stay away. That's my son!
The Naina.

1868
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:38,667
This is awesome.
This is awesome.

1869
01:30:38,792 --> 01:30:40,625
Listen to me dad.

1870
01:30:40,667 --> 01:30:42,667
Call me bro!

1871
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:43,958
I almost became the Naina.

1872
01:30:43,958 --> 01:30:46,458
But someone else interfered
and took it away.

1873
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:50,458
That's why I was surprised. I
guess our family is cursed.

1874
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:53,708
We won't be able to sit on the throne
even though it'll be right before us.

1875
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:56,875
Fine. Now that I am back. I'll
ensure you become the Naina.

1876
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:58,667
Where is your mom by the way?

1877
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:00,625
All of us are hiding in the
same house in the area.

1878
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:03,625
- Is your mom and Doss at the same house?
- Yes.

1879
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,500
Oh my god!

1880
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:09,292
Why would you do such a blunder?

1881
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,625
Let's start. Quick.

1882
01:31:11,625 --> 01:31:12,917
Benj do you still recognize me?

1883
01:31:12,917 --> 01:31:16,750
I'll finish you off! I am sparing you because I
like your mustache. Now go start the vehicle.

1884
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:18,708
START BEEP

1885
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:20,000
Doss you are doomed!

1886
01:31:20,667 --> 01:31:23,750
Durai, you have done
what Doss refused to do.

1887
01:31:23,875 --> 01:31:25,042
Thank you very much Durai.

1888
01:31:32,417 --> 01:31:33,750
Don't you lay your hands on her.

1889
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:34,958
We need her for the
business tomorrow.

1890
01:31:34,958 --> 01:31:36,667
Come on Naina now.

1891
01:31:42,667 --> 01:31:45,250
Naina. Don't you worry.
You start.

1892
01:32:01,333 --> 01:32:02,917
Welcome brother. How are you?

1893
01:32:03,542 --> 01:32:05,542
I was doing fine before.

1894
01:32:05,958 --> 01:32:07,208
Now. I'm doing just ok.

1895
01:32:07,208 --> 01:32:07,958
Dad.

1896
01:32:07,958 --> 01:32:09,375
Call me bro.

1897
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:10,750
This is my wife.

1898
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:11,833
Greetings.

1899
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:12,333
Good.

1900
01:32:12,375 --> 01:32:13,208
What's your name?

1901
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:14,167
Hema.

1902
01:32:14,375 --> 01:32:16,750
Just ask her what's
her nick name.

1903
01:32:16,917 --> 01:32:19,333
What's you nickname dear?

1904
01:32:19,708 --> 01:32:21,292
It's Dhanam.

1905
01:32:21,667 --> 01:32:24,708
Time for Batman vs
Superman Martha!

1906
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:26,042
Where is Doss?

1907
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:40,000
Move your leg a bit!

1908
01:32:41,292 --> 01:32:42,125
Doss...

1909
01:32:42,417 --> 01:32:45,333
Look how have you become Doss.

1910
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:49,125
Seeing you semi naked and
in this condition....

1911
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:53,042
my heart aches Doss!

1912
01:32:53,792 --> 01:32:57,375
After many years we are meeting...

1913
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,375
do you know how it feels?

1914
01:33:15,125 --> 01:33:16,792
Happy birthday to me.

1915
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,125
The one who attacked you...

1916
01:33:18,167 --> 01:33:20,500
should have attacked your mouth!

1917
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:22,958
You chased me away from this area...

1918
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,417
and did what not to
spoil my reputation.

1919
01:33:25,542 --> 01:33:27,958
Now look at your plight.

1920
01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:30,625
Doss you are just coal.

1921
01:33:30,708 --> 01:33:32,917
But my son is fire.

1922
01:33:33,125 --> 01:33:36,958
I will make him sit on the throne
which I could never achieve.

1923
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:42,625
Brother, I've been looking for you so
long to give you this almond milkshake.

1924
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:48,958
Did you ever look once for
your husband in this 15 years?

1925
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:50,417
Benji!

1926
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:52,833
Hi Dhanam!

1927
01:33:57,167 --> 01:33:58,167
Oh what a feeling!

1928
01:33:58,667 --> 01:34:00,042
Atrocious!

1929
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:00,792
Naughty.

1930
01:34:01,958 --> 01:34:02,750
Cheers!

1931
01:34:02,792 --> 01:34:05,875
So Benji what did you do
for 14 years without me?

1932
01:34:06,083 --> 01:34:10,167
I have written a lot
of letters for you.

1933
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:11,833
I'll show you one by one.

1934
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:12,708
Let's go.

1935
01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:16,125
What the...

1936
01:34:16,458 --> 01:34:17,625
Get set go!

1937
01:34:18,167 --> 01:34:19,375
You are the catcher.

1938
01:34:20,375 --> 01:34:21,667
Come let's go hide.

1939
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:25,375
- I hope the girl we've abducted will be safe downstairs?
- Yes.

1940
01:34:25,417 --> 01:34:27,208
Where are these guys hiding?

1941
01:34:27,292 --> 01:34:29,625
All the three of them
are deceiving us.

1942
01:34:29,625 --> 01:34:31,542
But if caught, we
must finish them off!

1943
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:32,625
Sure.

1944
01:34:34,833 --> 01:34:35,292
Bro.

1945
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:37,625
Leave that 'Finger Babu' to me.

1946
01:34:38,042 --> 01:34:39,042
Why?

1947
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:41,625
- He is just a show off.
- Correct.

1948
01:34:41,667 --> 01:34:43,208
I'll chop off his fingers.

1949
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:44,417
Chop of my fingers?

1950
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:46,917
Already I've only
three fingers left.

1951
01:34:47,292 --> 01:34:51,000
And they are planning to chop them down!

1952
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:57,250
There is so much of
violence out there...

1953
01:34:57,333 --> 01:34:59,583
and these guys are
romancing inside.

1954
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:02,708
I wish this light was
inside to disturb them!

1955
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:13,500
Why did you do that?

1956
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:18,292
Hema though I couldn't become the Naina,
I risked my life to get my dad here.

1957
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:20,083
I'm slowly getting into form.

1958
01:35:20,208 --> 01:35:24,125
That is why I am here and
spending time with you.

1959
01:35:24,833 --> 01:35:27,333
But if you make one
wrong move....

1960
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,958
I'll put an end to this.

1961
01:35:28,958 --> 01:35:29,750
I'm waiting.

1962
01:35:29,917 --> 01:35:31,417
I mean not put an
end to my anger.

1963
01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:32,625
I meant this meeting here.

1964
01:35:32,667 --> 01:35:34,500
I don't know why are you
still upset over me.

1965
01:35:34,792 --> 01:35:36,208
Listen carefully!

1966
01:35:36,458 --> 01:35:39,125
The curse of a married and
virgin guy will follow you.

1967
01:35:41,333 --> 01:35:42,125
Gotcha!

1968
01:35:42,125 --> 01:35:43,458
Who are you?

1969
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,167
Why are you hiding here Babu?

1970
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:46,542
Don't shout.

1971
01:35:46,792 --> 01:35:48,875
If they hear you
they will finish us.

1972
01:35:48,917 --> 01:35:50,958
Why are you playing hide
and seek at this age?

1973
01:35:51,167 --> 01:35:52,667
That's our situation.

1974
01:35:52,667 --> 01:35:54,208
You are hiding here.

1975
01:35:54,333 --> 01:35:55,917
She is hiding there.

1976
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:56,875
So who is the catcher?

1977
01:35:57,083 --> 01:35:58,208
Who are you talking about?

1978
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:01,417
What are you doing there?

1979
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:02,542
Don't tell them.

1980
01:36:02,542 --> 01:36:05,083
There are two chimpanzees here.

1981
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:06,000
Get lost!

1982
01:36:06,875 --> 01:36:12,250
People say that I am
dark and graceful.

1983
01:36:12,292 --> 01:36:15,208
He just called us Chimpanzee.

1984
01:36:15,542 --> 01:36:18,375
Dear audience it's
so embarrassing.

1985
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:23,625
Forget that. Who was
he talking about?

1986
01:36:29,375 --> 01:36:31,500
What I feared is now
happening here in this area.

1987
01:36:31,917 --> 01:36:33,792
They have started
trafficking women.

1988
01:36:34,042 --> 01:36:36,458
We will have to some how
save that girl by tonight.

1989
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:39,333
This will be the first
blow from our side.

1990
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:40,583
Father in law...

1991
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:42,417
Shall I?

1992
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:43,875
I'm not talking to you.

1993
01:36:44,458 --> 01:36:47,083
Ask Saravanan to get his men and...

1994
01:36:47,333 --> 01:36:48,667
ask them to get her to safety.

1995
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:51,625
Doss you are helpless and can't
take care of yourself.

1996
01:36:51,958 --> 01:36:54,250
They have given you marks
all over your body.

1997
01:36:54,333 --> 01:36:58,708
Why don't you just have
your juice and rest?

1998
01:36:58,917 --> 01:37:00,917
How dare you insult my son?

1999
01:37:01,917 --> 01:37:03,583
Did he stop you?

2000
01:37:03,792 --> 01:37:06,042
You go and save that girl.

2001
01:37:06,667 --> 01:37:08,458
Please don't send
him father in law.

2002
01:37:09,083 --> 01:37:11,083
Then we'll have to send
some one to save him.

2003
01:37:11,167 --> 01:37:12,125
Oh my god!

2004
01:37:12,208 --> 01:37:14,958
Why is your plight so bad?

2005
01:37:15,292 --> 01:37:16,833
No I won't give up.

2006
01:37:17,083 --> 01:37:18,833
I'll make you powerful.

2007
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:23,667
I've an excellent plan. Follow
that and bring her to safety.

2008
01:37:23,917 --> 01:37:25,083
You will witness it.

2009
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:26,833
Just wait and watch.

2010
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:29,833
Which weapon do you handle well?

2011
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:31,917
- What does he mean?
- Not looking good.

2012
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:33,958
Knife or gun. Which one
do you find easy to use.

2013
01:37:33,958 --> 01:37:35,250
Do whatever you want..

2014
01:37:35,875 --> 01:37:36,958
but no bloodshed please.

2015
01:37:37,458 --> 01:37:39,292
How is that possible?

2016
01:37:40,208 --> 01:37:42,333
Which is the biggest tank out of all?

2017
01:37:42,417 --> 01:37:43,042
This one.

2018
01:37:43,792 --> 01:37:45,417
Water-phobia.

2019
01:37:58,167 --> 01:37:58,792
Leader.

2020
01:37:58,917 --> 01:38:00,208
- I have got a doubt.
- What?

2021
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:01,125
Shut up and move.

2022
01:38:03,917 --> 01:38:06,583
Come on! Now come on!

2023
01:38:06,625 --> 01:38:07,125
Hold on.

2024
01:38:07,167 --> 01:38:08,083
Who is that?

2025
01:38:10,917 --> 01:38:11,750
Idiot!

2026
01:38:11,792 --> 01:38:12,583
I'll finish you off.

2027
01:38:12,708 --> 01:38:13,208
Sorry.

2028
01:38:15,917 --> 01:38:17,417
Leader, I have a doubt.

2029
01:38:17,667 --> 01:38:20,583
Johnny once more he asks
a doubt I'll snap him.

2030
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:25,958
This is the last round. Here.

2031
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:30,250
What are you doing here? They are already
there and they have found the catcher.

2032
01:38:30,333 --> 01:38:31,667
Quick. Someone has broke in.

2033
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:46,125
Gotcha!

2034
01:38:46,667 --> 01:38:49,083
Why is he saying our lines?

2035
01:38:49,125 --> 01:38:50,042
Correct bhai.

2036
01:38:50,542 --> 01:38:52,000
What is he saying?

2037
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:23,958
No. Don't.

2038
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:51,875
(Speaks Gibberish)

2039
01:39:52,042 --> 01:39:54,125
What was that now?

2040
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:57,833
Listen you! Step
if you have guts!

2041
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:58,958
Step in.

2042
01:39:59,125 --> 01:39:59,708
Come here.

2043
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:09,000
Look Johnny bhai, he is afraid.

2044
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:11,583
Looks like that.

2045
01:40:12,833 --> 01:40:14,625
Leader, I've a doubt.

2046
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:17,250
Why do you always have doubts?

2047
01:40:17,292 --> 01:40:20,583
I guess you want to know how
Johnny is going to finish him off.

2048
01:40:20,708 --> 01:40:21,958
Not that.

2049
01:40:22,125 --> 01:40:25,208
What happens to us if there
is a power failure now?

2050
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:27,000
We'll be doomed you idiot!

2051
01:40:38,333 --> 01:40:40,917
(Speaks Gibberish)

2052
01:40:42,542 --> 01:40:44,292
(Speaks Gibberish)

2053
01:40:45,917 --> 01:40:47,417
Please forgive me.

2054
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:48,875
Oh oh! What happened?

2055
01:40:48,917 --> 01:40:51,667
Johnny your dad escaped.

2056
01:40:52,333 --> 01:40:58,625
Your dad didn't craft a plan to finish
them off. It was to finish us off!

2057
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:02,750
You!

2058
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:07,958
You got a chance the other day.
You must have utilized it.

2059
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:09,333
One.

2060
01:41:09,625 --> 01:41:11,083
Your death is at my hands.

2061
01:41:11,292 --> 01:41:12,250
Two.

2062
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:14,292
Stop showing off now.

2063
01:41:14,625 --> 01:41:15,458
Three.

2064
01:41:16,583 --> 01:41:19,167
You shouldn't have
finished Subbiah.

2065
01:41:20,417 --> 01:41:21,458
Four.

2066
01:41:23,542 --> 01:41:24,417
Six.

2067
01:41:26,667 --> 01:41:27,708
Eight.

2068
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:30,292
Nine.

2069
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:50,458
Ten!

2070
01:42:00,167 --> 01:42:00,917
Johnny bhai!

2071
01:42:01,625 --> 01:42:03,208
Don! Don! Don!

2072
01:42:08,042 --> 01:42:11,542
Royapuram Johnny bhai is the Don!
Don! Don!

2073
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:30,625
Come on my dear little star.

2074
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:47,708
Sister.

2075
01:42:49,208 --> 01:42:49,750
What is it?

2076
01:42:49,792 --> 01:42:50,958
Durai's main man is no more.

2077
01:42:51,042 --> 01:42:52,542
Is it?

2078
01:42:54,125 --> 01:42:55,042
Is he dead?

2079
01:42:56,292 --> 01:42:56,958
Wait.

2080
01:42:57,375 --> 01:42:58,042
Move.

2081
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,125
What is it Durai?

2082
01:43:06,958 --> 01:43:08,500
Looks like he is gone.

2083
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,958
Wasn't it he who helped
you to enter this area?

2084
01:43:11,333 --> 01:43:12,750
You time is up.

2085
01:43:13,417 --> 01:43:14,708
Now shall I?

2086
01:43:15,667 --> 01:43:16,875
Would you like to watch?

2087
01:43:16,917 --> 01:43:17,875
Watch me.

2088
01:43:18,292 --> 01:43:20,125
Now hit it!

2089
01:43:32,375 --> 01:43:33,917
Naina is back!

2090
01:43:37,375 --> 01:43:38,583
You are next!

2091
01:43:45,625 --> 01:43:47,250
Naina is back!

2092
01:43:54,167 --> 01:43:55,458
Don't let it sink in.

2093
01:43:55,667 --> 01:43:56,792
I saw his face.

2094
01:43:56,917 --> 01:43:58,167
He looked scared.

2095
01:43:58,375 --> 01:43:59,500
I am sure.

2096
01:43:59,708 --> 01:44:01,833
This is the right time
to finish him off.

2097
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:06,667
Little fellows.

2098
01:44:09,417 --> 01:44:10,625
I can't do it all by myself.

2099
01:44:11,125 --> 01:44:11,917
I need men.

2100
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:15,417
I spoke to Saavanan. Let's
go meet him in person.

2101
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:17,542
He'll definitely help us.

2102
01:44:17,625 --> 01:44:18,708
Ok Doss.

2103
01:44:21,833 --> 01:44:23,000
Start the vehicle.

2104
01:44:23,875 --> 01:44:24,958
Hey you!

2105
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,958
How can you leave without me?

2106
01:44:27,042 --> 01:44:28,208
Ask him to get out.

2107
01:44:28,625 --> 01:44:30,708
If he also comes then
there is no one at home.

2108
01:44:30,833 --> 01:44:34,417
I don't have a
daughter like you.

2109
01:44:34,875 --> 01:44:36,417
I've a brave son.

2110
01:44:36,708 --> 01:44:40,792
He'll not only take care of the
house but the entire locality!

2111
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:41,958
Now start.

2112
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:43,542
Can't avoid him. Start.

2113
01:44:45,042 --> 01:44:46,917
Why are you so cool Durai?

2114
01:44:47,125 --> 01:44:50,917
There are only two days left to arrange and
traffick a woman. Can you get someone?

2115
01:44:52,958 --> 01:44:54,458
Why are you all standing here?

2116
01:44:54,583 --> 01:44:57,208
They finished off your men
and took the girl away.

2117
01:44:57,458 --> 01:44:58,667
What were you all doing?

2118
01:44:58,833 --> 01:45:00,500
Stop calling yourselves rogues!

2119
01:45:01,333 --> 01:45:03,042
All your men are
not so good Durai.

2120
01:45:03,125 --> 01:45:05,333
You are in danger right here.

2121
01:45:06,542 --> 01:45:07,333
What did you say?

2122
01:45:07,333 --> 01:45:09,417
You are in danger right here.

2123
01:45:11,625 --> 01:45:14,542
Don't worry Durai. It's our place.
The girl will be safe.

2124
01:45:16,667 --> 01:45:18,292
Naina is back!

2125
01:45:19,667 --> 01:45:21,542
Doss is somewhere inside
the area for sure.

2126
01:45:24,083 --> 01:45:26,167
Search all the
houses in the area.

2127
01:45:26,292 --> 01:45:27,333
Shut up!

2128
01:45:27,958 --> 01:45:29,458
Search everywhere.

2129
01:45:32,917 --> 01:45:35,417
Doss and men shouldn't
 live anymore.

2130
01:45:36,625 --> 01:45:37,417
Hello?

2131
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:39,958
Should I come?

2132
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:41,125
Hema also?

2133
01:45:41,625 --> 01:45:42,458
Puli keep an eye.

2134
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:43,000
Ok bhai.

2135
01:45:43,083 --> 01:45:44,875
Now quick. Come.
It's getting late.

2136
01:45:48,667 --> 01:45:49,500
Where is Doss?

2137
01:45:49,792 --> 01:45:50,667
I don't know.

2138
01:45:50,917 --> 01:45:52,500
Did you see Doss?

2139
01:45:56,250 --> 01:45:57,083
What?

2140
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:01,583
Shanmugan looks like they are searching
all the houses in the area.

2141
01:46:01,958 --> 01:46:03,500
Everyone else are at home.

2142
01:46:03,625 --> 01:46:05,375
Don't get tensed.
Give me the phone.

2143
01:46:07,375 --> 01:46:08,125
Tell me.

2144
01:46:08,167 --> 01:46:09,417
Listen carefully.
Don't get upset.

2145
01:46:09,417 --> 01:46:10,833
They have rounded up the area.

2146
01:46:10,875 --> 01:46:11,708
What?

2147
01:46:12,125 --> 01:46:13,583
Now listen to me.

2148
01:46:13,625 --> 01:46:14,917
Come on move.

2149
01:46:23,833 --> 01:46:24,750
Where to?

2150
01:46:24,958 --> 01:46:26,458
Check everywhere.
Leave no house.

2151
01:46:45,958 --> 01:46:48,500
Naina, just miss. Or else they
would've finished us off.

2152
01:46:48,708 --> 01:46:50,333
Where is my daughter and her husband?

2153
01:46:50,375 --> 01:46:50,833
What?

2154
01:46:51,458 --> 01:46:53,458
They already left because
Benjamin called them.

2155
01:46:53,958 --> 01:46:55,000
I never called them.

2156
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:56,125
Where are they?

2157
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:03,875
What a pity?

2158
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:05,583
All this time they were here.

2159
01:47:05,583 --> 01:47:07,125
Right opposite to our
main man's house.

2160
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:08,375
And we never found out.

2161
01:47:09,542 --> 01:47:10,917
Naina, this house
belonged to Murthy.

2162
01:47:10,917 --> 01:47:13,750
It was locked up for a long time.
That's why none of us doubted.

2163
01:47:15,542 --> 01:47:16,333
Now come on.

2164
01:47:16,583 --> 01:47:18,042
They have been watching us.

2165
01:47:18,292 --> 01:47:20,833
That woman insulted me today.

2166
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:23,417
They would have watched that too right?

2167
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,500
Come let's go upstairs.
Get some cigarettes.

2168
01:47:32,917 --> 01:47:35,375
All this while we thought the
whole area was under our control.

2169
01:47:35,417 --> 01:47:39,333
But he was here all this while. He finished
off my main man and left with the girl.

2170
01:47:39,667 --> 01:47:43,208
We must find him tonight
and finish him.

2171
01:47:45,208 --> 01:47:46,708
Any guess where they could be?

2172
01:47:49,042 --> 01:47:50,833
That's when I was done
with my 12th grade.

2173
01:47:50,833 --> 01:47:52,833
I guess I am not going
to get anything to do.

2174
01:47:54,208 --> 01:47:58,292
I had to play pranks to get you
out and spend some time with you.

2175
01:47:58,417 --> 01:48:00,625
- Now that we are here, you keep making me desperate!
- Sorry.

2176
01:48:00,625 --> 01:48:05,750
I grew up watching my dad. That why I felt
bad when I knew you were not a rogue.

2177
01:48:06,333 --> 01:48:07,917
But when you saved my friend.

2178
01:48:08,833 --> 01:48:10,458
I was proud of my husband.

2179
01:48:11,083 --> 01:48:12,167
Fine.

2180
01:48:12,667 --> 01:48:14,375
It's getting late.

2181
01:48:35,083 --> 01:48:36,292
I said come here.

2182
01:49:28,208 --> 01:49:29,583
The deal is still on.

2183
01:49:29,958 --> 01:49:31,875
We have got another girl.

2184
01:49:33,042 --> 01:49:34,833
This one is better
than the previous.

2185
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:45,542
Look here.

2186
01:49:46,667 --> 01:49:47,833
She looks awesome.

2187
01:49:48,042 --> 01:49:48,792
Your wife.

2188
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:50,875
Listen you coward!

2189
01:49:52,667 --> 01:49:54,542
Your death will be at
the hands of Johnny.

2190
01:50:11,208 --> 01:50:12,958
Your death will be at
the hands of Johnny.

2191
01:50:15,125 --> 01:50:17,042
Your death will be at
the hands of Johnny.

2192
01:50:20,875 --> 01:50:23,000
Your death will be at
the hands of Johnny.

2193
01:50:26,208 --> 01:50:28,542
Your death will be at
the hands of Johnny.

2194
01:50:29,125 --> 01:50:30,000
What's with him?

2195
01:50:30,167 --> 01:50:32,000
His phobia has kicked in.

2196
01:50:32,667 --> 01:50:35,917
Hey Bhaskar. Take her away.

2197
01:50:35,958 --> 01:50:36,500
Leave me.

2198
01:50:37,292 --> 01:50:37,875
Johnny!

2199
01:50:38,667 --> 01:50:39,458
What is it?

2200
01:50:39,958 --> 01:50:43,417
Looks like people have too
much of faith in you?

2201
01:50:44,750 --> 01:50:46,542
Your death will be at
the hands of Johnny.

2202
01:50:48,792 --> 01:50:50,875
So my death will be at the
hands of Johnny? Fine.

2203
01:50:51,917 --> 01:50:53,125
Tomorrow night...

2204
01:50:53,458 --> 01:50:54,750
I'm going to sell off your wife.

2205
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,417
I'm sparing your life.

2206
01:50:58,208 --> 01:50:59,917
Go do whatever you can.

2207
01:51:00,583 --> 01:51:01,667
I'll be here.

2208
01:51:04,167 --> 01:51:05,917
Your death will be at
the hands of Johnny.

2209
01:51:06,708 --> 01:51:09,167
He looks very funny!

2210
01:51:09,917 --> 01:51:11,000
Take him away.

2211
01:51:11,625 --> 01:51:12,875
Irritating fellow.

2212
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:17,375
Don't finish him off. He has to
try finishing Durai tomorrow.

2213
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:41,958
Dear...

2214
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:43,542
What is it?

2215
01:51:44,417 --> 01:51:45,458
Your eyes look teary?

2216
01:51:47,167 --> 01:51:48,458
You must not cry at this hour.

2217
01:51:48,833 --> 01:51:49,625
You must be angry.

2218
01:51:50,625 --> 01:51:51,500
I am angry.

2219
01:51:52,292 --> 01:51:53,083
What can I do?

2220
01:51:54,292 --> 01:51:56,125
I can be a coward
to all the men.

2221
01:51:58,167 --> 01:52:00,125
But he made me a coward
in front of my wife.

2222
01:52:01,583 --> 01:52:03,708
She believed till the end
that I'll thrash him.

2223
01:52:04,125 --> 01:52:06,667
Not only her. We all
believe that you can.

2224
01:52:06,875 --> 01:52:08,417
Every one in this
world is a coward.

2225
01:52:08,708 --> 01:52:09,750
Right from our birth.

2226
01:52:10,792 --> 01:52:12,708
Everyone starts
their life crying.

2227
01:52:13,125 --> 01:52:13,958
You have cried now.

2228
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,125
Consider this a re-birth!

2229
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:18,542
It's not a big deal
to become a rogue.

2230
01:52:19,083 --> 01:52:20,792
You can see it in
your enemies eyes...

2231
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,292
that he is going to finish you.

2232
01:52:22,625 --> 01:52:24,083
By that time our weapon...

2233
01:52:24,333 --> 01:52:26,000
should've finished him off.

2234
01:52:26,375 --> 01:52:27,458
You'll do it!

2235
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:32,125
I inquired everyone. But no
one is ready to gather men.

2236
01:52:32,375 --> 01:52:36,042
Everyone are scared because
he has attacked you.

2237
01:52:36,792 --> 01:52:38,417
We only have one day left.

2238
01:52:38,833 --> 01:52:39,958
We are only five of us.

2239
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:42,083
So is there no one who
an get us henchmen?

2240
01:52:42,083 --> 01:52:43,542
There is one person.

2241
01:52:45,875 --> 01:52:47,792
He'll get as many men you want.

2242
01:52:48,208 --> 01:52:49,208
Not for you.

2243
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:50,458
But for me.

2244
01:52:55,333 --> 01:52:57,042
He is the specialist.

2245
01:52:57,250 --> 01:52:58,667
Mahabali Maha.

2246
01:52:59,125 --> 01:53:01,083
He will never give up.

2247
01:53:30,042 --> 01:53:36,250
My dear prince Naina.

2248
01:53:41,917 --> 01:53:42,917
Hey Doss...

2249
01:53:43,333 --> 01:53:45,042
now do you understand
who is powerful?

2250
01:53:45,042 --> 01:53:46,333
Now you need my help. No?

2251
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:48,292
You chased us both and...

2252
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:49,500
became the Naina.

2253
01:53:49,792 --> 01:53:51,375
Mahabali you couldn't
have done it.

2254
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:55,125
Did you think
Mahabali Maha is...

2255
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:58,083
a fellow who carries around a
map, speaking good English...

2256
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:01,583
and guiding the tourists
around as a tourist guide?

2257
01:54:02,083 --> 01:54:03,000
I am MAHA!

2258
01:54:03,208 --> 01:54:04,792
Mahabali Maha.

2259
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,125
I am a gangster!

2260
01:54:06,833 --> 01:54:08,958
Don't you worry Benjamin.

2261
01:54:09,125 --> 01:54:10,292
I shall gather my bros.

2262
01:54:10,458 --> 01:54:11,792
We'll meet in the climax!

2263
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,583
I need a map of Royapuram.

2264
01:54:16,083 --> 01:54:17,708
Benjamin and Doss
are now a team.

2265
01:54:18,375 --> 01:54:21,000
They were the one who devised a
plan and finished off my dad.

2266
01:54:21,042 --> 01:54:22,417
They'll definitely
come tomorrow.

2267
01:54:24,875 --> 01:54:26,750
Why did you get this?

2268
01:54:27,458 --> 01:54:29,125
I got the paper so that the
table doesn't get spoiled.

2269
01:54:29,167 --> 01:54:30,167
Where is the map?

2270
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:32,417
I cannot get the map
as per your wish.

2271
01:54:32,583 --> 01:54:34,208
Here try doing
something with this.

2272
01:54:42,917 --> 01:54:44,667
Are you looking for
underground route?

2273
01:54:44,792 --> 01:54:47,625
I just placed a tile
to balance the table.

2274
01:54:49,917 --> 01:54:51,167
So this is Royapuram.

2275
01:54:51,333 --> 01:54:53,875
We all know that.
Tell us the plan.

2276
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,167
We are going to call this the "Wi-Fi" Sketch!

2277
01:54:59,083 --> 01:55:00,667
This is the society hall.

2278
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,208
Durai resides here.

2279
01:55:02,625 --> 01:55:04,500
Gather all our men
from round the city.

2280
01:55:04,833 --> 01:55:06,500
No one should enter
our area tomorrow.

2281
01:55:06,750 --> 01:55:09,458
We should know where
he has placed his men.

2282
01:55:09,542 --> 01:55:10,625
Not only that.

2283
01:55:10,958 --> 01:55:13,250
We should find out
where he has hid Hema.

2284
01:55:13,375 --> 01:55:16,875
To know that we need trustworthy
person over there.

2285
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:19,708
- No one should doubt him.
- Correct.

2286
01:55:19,792 --> 01:55:21,500
We do have men there.

2287
01:55:26,958 --> 01:55:28,417
So the girl is here.

2288
01:55:28,625 --> 01:55:30,750
So there is only one
way to get inside.

2289
01:55:34,083 --> 01:55:36,125
He has three layers of security.

2290
01:55:36,333 --> 01:55:38,875
The third layer is heavy weight.

2291
01:55:38,958 --> 01:55:42,208
He has all the major
gangsters by his side.

2292
01:55:42,583 --> 01:55:43,875
30 of them.

2293
01:55:44,125 --> 01:55:46,958
Second layer is middle weight.

2294
01:55:47,125 --> 01:55:49,458
All are our area fellows.

2295
01:55:49,792 --> 01:55:51,708
First layer is the
light weight.

2296
01:55:51,792 --> 01:55:55,625
These are kids! We can
easily deal them.

2297
01:55:55,833 --> 01:55:57,750
With so many people out
there, what do we do?

2298
01:55:57,833 --> 01:56:00,042
Park the bike at
the street corner.

2299
01:56:03,458 --> 01:56:05,958
They have parked the bikes
so that they can escape.

2300
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:07,875
Puncture all those bikes.

2301
01:56:09,208 --> 01:56:11,083
Stick bills everywhere.

2302
01:56:14,042 --> 01:56:16,333
Have ceremonies in houses
opposite to each other.

2303
01:56:20,208 --> 01:56:22,125
Looks like they are bringing
in people in name of ceremony.

2304
01:56:22,125 --> 01:56:23,708
Allow no one new into our area.

2305
01:56:24,167 --> 01:56:28,625
Stop! Stop! Don't you dare enter.
No matter what ceremony it is.

2306
01:56:30,292 --> 01:56:31,208
All that's fine.

2307
01:56:31,458 --> 01:56:33,292
How do we deal the
heavy weight men?

2308
01:56:33,375 --> 01:56:35,458
That's where Mahabali
plays his part.

2309
01:56:35,625 --> 01:56:37,083
He will take care of it.

2310
01:56:37,083 --> 01:56:38,583
Finally Durai will be left.

2311
01:56:38,833 --> 01:56:40,042
What will do to him?

2312
01:56:40,042 --> 01:56:42,958
I've crafted out a whole new
plan for finishing him off.

2313
01:56:44,458 --> 01:56:46,208
Now let me see how they come.

2314
01:56:49,875 --> 01:56:52,500
Bro, there is a water lorry
here at this odd hour.

2315
01:56:52,667 --> 01:56:54,458
I feel something is fishy.

2316
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:57,542
They must be inside it. Drive
it down to the society hall.

2317
01:56:57,583 --> 01:56:59,208
Ok Naina.

2318
01:56:59,208 --> 01:57:02,000
You are caught. Now come on.

2319
01:57:06,958 --> 01:57:08,708
Come on now.

2320
01:57:08,792 --> 01:57:11,292
They are inside it.
They are trapped!

2321
01:57:11,333 --> 01:57:13,167
Don't you under
estimate Bhaskar.

2322
01:57:14,292 --> 01:57:16,083
Call the driver.

2323
01:57:25,458 --> 01:57:28,083
- Why is your lorry here in our area?
- I never entered your area.

2324
01:57:28,125 --> 01:57:30,000
I just entered a bit into
the area to take a reverse.

2325
01:57:30,042 --> 01:57:31,958
It was your men who
bought me till here.

2326
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,958
I feel something is fishy. Open
the tap and drain out the water.

2327
01:57:35,167 --> 01:57:36,875
Ok Naina.

2328
01:57:37,250 --> 01:57:40,833
No please. Please don't
waste the water in it.

2329
01:58:15,708 --> 01:58:17,750
It's petrol! Run!

2330
01:58:23,958 --> 01:58:25,458
Just for fun. It's water.

2331
01:58:25,875 --> 01:58:26,792
Got scared is it?

2332
01:58:31,125 --> 01:58:33,000
Chief, there is no one inside.

2333
01:58:33,208 --> 01:58:35,708
Just water Naina. I
already thought so.

2334
01:58:35,958 --> 01:58:37,500
No one can bypass us.

2335
01:58:41,792 --> 01:58:43,708
Hello?

2336
01:58:44,208 --> 01:58:46,792
Shall we meet? One....

2337
01:58:48,333 --> 01:58:49,667
Two...

2338
01:58:51,833 --> 01:58:53,625
How are they going to come?

2339
01:58:54,125 --> 01:58:55,375
Hey Bhaskar.

2340
01:58:56,042 --> 01:58:57,625
- What?
- So did you check out the teaser?

2341
01:58:57,625 --> 01:58:59,333
Time to watch the movie now.
Ready?

2342
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:12,417
Start camera.

2343
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:13,375
Action!

2344
01:59:13,625 --> 01:59:15,458
Naina they are here.

2345
01:59:17,292 --> 01:59:19,167
They have walked
all the way here.

2346
01:59:24,042 --> 01:59:26,292
Johnny bhai time for
the first sequence.

2347
01:59:31,333 --> 01:59:34,500
Naina, they did park the bike to escape.

2348
01:59:34,708 --> 01:59:36,583
It is to attack us.

2349
01:59:38,333 --> 01:59:41,792
Use all your movie watching experience.
Now throw it Johnny bhai.

2350
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:55,042
They have attacked the
light weight layer.

2351
01:59:55,125 --> 01:59:58,167
Don't you worry. The second
layer guys are here.

2352
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:05,750
Step out dear daddys!

2353
02:00:09,542 --> 02:00:11,167
Thats our fathers.

2354
02:00:11,875 --> 02:00:14,292
How dare you guys threaten us?

2355
02:00:14,917 --> 02:00:16,458
We are the good old gangsters.

2356
02:00:16,542 --> 02:00:17,750
The name is Pandi!

2357
02:00:17,833 --> 02:00:19,042
Soda bottle Pandi!

2358
02:00:21,792 --> 02:00:23,750
Dad no. Please.

2359
02:00:23,833 --> 02:00:26,208
No dad. Please don't beat me.

2360
02:00:27,458 --> 02:00:30,500
- How could you beat your own son?
- Is it?

2361
02:00:30,792 --> 02:00:32,542
Sekar come here.

2362
02:00:32,625 --> 02:00:35,292
Here you thrash my son.
I'll thrash your son.

2363
02:00:35,333 --> 02:00:37,083
Who are you? Why are
you thrashing me?

2364
02:00:37,250 --> 02:00:39,292
I am your father you idiot.

2365
02:00:39,542 --> 02:00:41,375
But my mom never told me!

2366
02:00:41,542 --> 02:00:44,917
Naina, they used their
fathers to attack them.

2367
02:01:04,125 --> 02:01:06,125
Brother. Come on!

2368
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:08,417
Who me?

2369
02:01:09,250 --> 02:01:10,333
Not you?

2370
02:01:10,708 --> 02:01:12,542
I called out the real bros.

2371
02:01:35,625 --> 02:01:36,958
Come on dear!

2372
02:01:41,167 --> 02:01:43,833
Naina, they have got the
villains from the yesteryear.

2373
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:50,583
This ain't my knife!

2374
02:01:50,917 --> 02:01:51,875
Check this out.

2375
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:58,292
Naina the ceremony set ups
were not to gather men.

2376
02:01:58,583 --> 02:02:00,042
It was to gather weapons.

2377
02:02:03,958 --> 02:02:08,708
Naina, looks like they have bought
an alien army in Royapuram!

2378
02:02:23,417 --> 02:02:25,167
They are raising hell boss.

2379
02:02:28,792 --> 02:02:30,500
Time out.

2380
02:02:51,333 --> 02:02:55,292
Naina, they have the whole Royapuram under their
control. Please grant me two days leave.

2381
02:03:01,458 --> 02:03:03,167
This is what will rule here forever!

2382
02:03:50,167 --> 02:03:51,667
You are trapped!

2383
02:04:17,458 --> 02:04:19,458
You are trapped.

2384
02:04:22,083 --> 02:04:23,875
You are trapped!

2385
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:26,917
You are trapped!

2386
02:04:30,667 --> 02:04:32,292
You are trapped!

2387
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:35,125
You are trapped!

2388
02:04:36,083 --> 02:04:38,083
You are trapped!

2389
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:54,792
Finally Durai will be left.

2390
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,250
What will you do to him?

2391
02:04:56,792 --> 02:04:59,708
I've crafted out a whole new
plan for finishing him off.

2392
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:03,583
We'll damp the soil and make clay.
Use it to cover the blood.

2393
02:05:07,667 --> 02:05:08,708
Trapped.

2394
02:05:10,917 --> 02:05:13,000
Now,you are trapped!

2395
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:22,500
I am the next Naina!

2396
02:06:51,708 --> 02:06:53,000
No Johnny!

2397
02:06:53,208 --> 02:06:53,917
Don't.

2398
02:06:54,042 --> 02:06:54,875
Johnny?

2399
02:06:55,292 --> 02:06:57,292
I have another name.

2400
02:06:58,542 --> 02:07:04,500
Benjamin bhai, what is that powerful
another name Johnny bhai has?

2401
02:07:06,625 --> 02:07:07,750
NAINA!

2402
02:07:07,875 --> 02:07:08,708
No Johnny. Don't.

2403
02:07:10,292 --> 02:07:11,167
No Johnny. Don't.

2404
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:13,583
No Johnny. Don't.

2405
02:07:14,375 --> 02:07:15,208
No!
