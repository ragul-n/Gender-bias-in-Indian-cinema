1
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,792
<i>Sunny...</i>

2
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,208
<i>Brother, I'll be kicked out of the team
if I don't play.</i>

3
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,542
<i>My job...</i>

4
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:49,250
<i>You're going to be fine.</i>

5
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,208
<i>You'll be fine. Just stay with me.</i>

6
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:52,750
<i>Call Preet.</i>

7
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,375
<i>Please call Preet.</i>

8
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,250
<i>I am Harpreet Kaur.</i>

9
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,958
<i>Used to play center forward for India.</i>

10
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,875
<i>But this story isn't about me.</i>

11
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,542
<i>It's about Sandeep Singh.</i>

12
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,583
Brother Bikram,

13
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:21,000
I've heard that the coach
doesn't have a television,

14
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:25,917
so he punishes us for his entertainment.

15
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,208
Shut up, Sandeep.

16
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:30,542
We'll get whacked if he hears you.

17
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:36,625
There'll be no stopping me if you
even look at the girls' team again!

18
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll break your bones.

19
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,917
Three minutes.
Get six Samosas from Changat Ram. Run.

20
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:30,167
Samosas...

21
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:31,375
Samosas...

22
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,417
- Changat Ram's?
- Mangat Ram's?

23
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:35,083
Which ones?

24
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,042
Where did you get them from?

25
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,875
Mangat Ram.

26
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:55,500
What did he do, Coach? Why the punishment?

27
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:59,042
I asked for Samosas from Changat Ram.
He got them from Mangat Ram instead.

28
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,833
What difference does it make?

29
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:04,250
It's the same shop
with two separate counters.

30
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:08,458
Everything is cooked in the same kitchen.
And it's a great kitchen, I must say!

31
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:13,250
The poor boy is unnecessarily
getting his back broken.

32
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,458
So?

33
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,167
Doesn't look like...

34
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:23,458
He ran away.
I don't think he's going to come back.

35
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:27,792
If he wants to play hockey in Shahbad,
this is where he'll have to come.

36
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,667
And his elder brother is here
to complete his punishment. Bikram!

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,250
Why quit playing hockey?

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,583
Your brother took your share
of punishment already.

39
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,333
I've decided, Mom.

40
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,542
There's no way
I'm going back to that Kartar.

41
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,667
Calm down.

42
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,458
Try to get some sleep. Come on.

43
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:04,417
<i>O' merciful Lord</i>

44
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:08,042
<i>Let me stay at your feet</i>

45
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,417
<i>O' merciful Lord...</i>

46
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,792
Gurcharan, he's just a kid.

47
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,583
He'll take up some other sport.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,542
You over think and worry unnecessarily.

49
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,125
Can't help it.

50
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:27,583
I am a bit nervous
since we lost our house in the flood.

51
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,292
If you hadn't given us a place to stay--

52
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,250
Enough.

53
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,583
Talk about your house again and..

54
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,833
I'll keep Daljit and the kids here

55
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:39,708
and throw you out.

56
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:42,292
Who are you going to throw out?

57
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,750
This one, who else!

58
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,167
I raised him and made him a man.

59
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:50,208
And now he's trying to be my father.

60
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,542
Sit.

61
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,583
Fine.

62
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,375
Don't get angry.

63
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:08,250
Tea's getting cold.

64
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,875
<i>O' merciful Lord</i>

65
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:23,250
<i>Let me stay at your feet</i>

66
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:27,042
<i>Let me stay at your feet</i>

67
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,500
My brave child!

68
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,708
This entire farmland belongs to us.
Do whatever you like here.

69
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,458
Just don't let the birds
come near the crops.

70
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,458
We'll have lunch together.

71
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,958
- Do you know how to drive a tractor?
- Not yet.

72
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,417
I'll teach you.

73
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:57,125
I'm going to learn to drive a tractor.

74
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:12,417
<i>Oh, no!</i>

75
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,958
<i>Yes!</i>

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Sandeep!

77
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,375
Let's go. We're getting late.

78
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,125
Your brother must be starving to death.

79
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,125
Hurry up.

80
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,375
Slow down, man.

81
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:27,958
I can't hold on to anything.
Both my hands are busy feeding you.

82
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:32,542
Gujji, my friend, I'll either die
in an accident if I let you ride

83
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:35,125
or die of hunger if you don't feed me now.

84
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:39,042
So, stop cribbing and focus on giving me
a bit of the pickle instead.

85
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,250
Really?

86
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,875
Stuff it all in then.

87
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,125
Hey! Not all of it.

88
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,875
- How are you doing, boys?
- Great.

89
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,292
Coach, I must say,
Bikram's turned out to be a good player.

90
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,208
I have trained him to be a good one.

91
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,792
How long do you want these kids
to be hanging from up here?

92
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,667
Stay put for four hours
or I'll beat you with your hockey sticks.

93
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:06,667
Heard that?

94
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:08,500
Four hours.

95
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,250
Take me along.

96
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,375
- Let me finish the Samosas first.
- I'm leaving.

97
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,625
No, wait.

98
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,542
Hey! He's gone!

99
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,375
That's enough.

100
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,042
Good evening, Coach.

101
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,500
Good evening, sir.

102
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,958
Preet, pass the ball. What are you doing?

103
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:31,583
Hurry up.

104
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,667
- Hold this.
- Take this.

105
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,083
Presenting!

106
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,042
Where's the pickle?

107
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,292
Why didn't you finish off
the Paratha as well?

108
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,250
What am I supposed to eat
the Paratha with?

109
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:48,833
With my love.

110
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,875
Hockey players shouldn't be eating
too much pickle.

111
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,958
Have fun while you can.

112
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:01,375
- Your time shall come too.
- It's time for me to leave now.

113
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,292
- Have some.
- No, thanks.

114
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:08,500
Where are you off to, Mr. Busy Person?

115
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,667
You got Samosas from Mangat Ram, right?

116
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,208
Keep hanging upside down.
You won't get to play hockey.

117
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:20,833
I told you to hold on to the bike,
not to lay it down.

118
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:22,750
Thanks to you, racing the bike!

119
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:25,042
The accelerator cable has snapped.

120
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,000
Your bike is from the ancient age.

121
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,083
This was expected. Now let me fix it.

122
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,417
Here comes the doctor of automobiles!

123
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:38,875
What the...

124
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:42,292
Did you get a shot in the rear, Doctor?

125
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,625
Pass the ball.

126
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:54,417
Stop staring at me.

127
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,292
Your mouth might just start watering
the grass on the ground.

128
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,667
Look up in the front
before flicking the ball.

129
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,625
Be glad it didn't hit you in the front.

130
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:05,625
You're Bikram's brother, right?

131
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,917
Right. Not your brother for sure.

132
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,542
This area is for players.
Mechanics are not allowed here.

133
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,750
I'm also a player.

134
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,208
Your brother would be ashamed
to hear that.

135
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:21,708
Not as good as him, but I too can play.

136
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:22,833
Oh, really!

137
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,875
Let's see how good a player you are then.

138
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,042
No, you must be tired.

139
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,375
I don't want you to lose
and feel embarrassed.

140
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:34,125
That's okay. Think of it
as some entertainment for yourself.

141
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,458
Let's do it.

142
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,500
Come on.

143
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,417
One-on-one.

144
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,042
Whoever scores, gets the ball.

145
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,708
You know what, you try first.

146
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,042
If I start the game, you won't get
anywhere close to the ball.

147
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,042
The game is what really is
worth falling for.

148
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:39,000
- Don't go wasting time after girls.
- It's been a long time since I practiced,

149
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,417
so I couldn't score.

150
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You'll score if you have a goal in life,
or you'll just keep biting the dust.

151
00:11:47,042 --> 00:11:49,042
- Ma'am...
- Harpreet.

152
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:50,917
Sandeep.

153
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,125
- Ma'am, can we talk in private?
- Why?

154
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,375
Just a little away from Gujji.
I don't want him to hear us.

155
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,375
I was just trying to act smart
in front of my friend.

156
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,167
I knew you'd beat me in hockey.

157
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:05,000
Anyhow, forget that now.

158
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,292
I was just trying my luck, but I failed.

159
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:10,875
You are not that bad.

160
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:13,958
If you practice next time,
you might just score a goal.

161
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:15,542
Will you play with me again?

162
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,208
Will you?

163
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,292
Follow me.

164
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:29,417
<i>Our lives were about to change
in the next six months.</i>

165
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:32,208
<i>Those six months
were the best moments of my life</i>

166
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:34,292
<i>and perhaps, of his life as well.</i>

167
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,250
Ouch.

168
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,042
Careful there.

169
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,583
This isn't a hockey stick.

170
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,917
- Keep it straight then.
- There you go.

171
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:52,333
In the age of mobiles and internet,

172
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:57,333
Yellow Printers can't stand
to compete in the business.

173
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,167
And Sandeep is of no help.

174
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,417
Have your meal and leave the rest to God.

175
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,625
Son.

176
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,625
Once you get selected for India

177
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,875
I am going to retire from this job...

178
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,667
- and we'll buy a new place for ourselves.
- What new place?

179
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:25,708
Well, I was just saying that...

180
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:27,375
What was I saying?

181
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,958
Tell him what I was talking about.

182
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:37,500
He was talking about Bikram
getting a place in the Indian team.

183
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:38,958
Right.

184
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,833
Yes, he will.

185
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:43,667
Of course, he will. Do you doubt that?

186
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:45,917
No.

187
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,542
I have no doubts.

188
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,333
<i>Sometimes I address her
As my guiding light</i>

189
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,417
<i>Sometimes I address her
As the love of my life</i>

190
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,542
<i>Lost in love, I barely survive</i>

191
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:02,708
<i>Don't leave me Don't leave</i>

192
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:05,917
<i>I want to dwell in your eyes</i>

193
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,917
<i>I want to dwell in your eyes</i>

194
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,750
<i>I want to dwell in your eyes</i>

195
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,958
You ran away nine years ago
to escape your punishment.

196
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,250
There's no place for a runaway like you
on this field. Get lost!

197
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,125
Clean that properly.

198
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,292
Sir, I want to play hockey.

199
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:42,042
Complete your nine years
of punishment first.

200
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,000
Don't touch a hockey stick until then.

201
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,833
- Clean that properly!
- Okay, sir.

202
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,000
<i>This game called love, they say</i>

203
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,250
<i>Can't be won or lost, come what may</i>

204
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,000
Keep going straight.

205
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,292
Not that way!
Go straight, I said. Keep going straight.

206
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:08,125
<i>Love makes it tough to survive</i>

207
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:14,333
<i>You can see how love hurts...</i>

208
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,333
Show me your hands...

209
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:24,292
<i>I shall endure all the pain</i>

210
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,083
<i>I will never complain</i>

211
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,667
<i>This game called love...</i>

212
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,292
Pass it.

213
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,125
<i>...they say</i>

214
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,333
<i>Can't be won or lost...</i>

215
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,875
Come on, let's go.

216
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,542
Idiots, can't play.

217
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:46,375
<i>Costs you your life</i>

218
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,458
<i>Love makes it tough to survive...</i>

219
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,000
Can I go home, sir?

220
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:55,292
You'll never be able to finish
the punishment if you go home. Get going.

221
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:58,167
<i>Lost in love, I barely survive</i>

222
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,958
<i>Don't leave me</i>

223
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,625
<i>Don't leave</i>

224
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,417
<i>Sometimes I address her
As my guiding light</i>

225
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,708
<i>Sometimes I address her
As the love of my life</i>

226
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:08,833
<i>Lost in love...</i>

227
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,208
Can I go home, sir?

228
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,542
Go.

229
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,833
<i>Don't leave me</i>

230
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,958
I think I should practice a bit more.

231
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,333
- Get going then.
- Okay.

232
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,458
Will you even play hockey
or just keep doing this?

233
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,833
He doesn't let me go
anywhere close to hockey.

234
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,375
Come play with me, then.

235
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,458
Now?

236
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,000
When else?

237
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:49,125
- It'll get dark in five minutes.
- Then let's play for five minutes.

238
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,250
Okay.

239
00:16:54,542 --> 00:17:01,375
<i>When you're away
I visit saints to set my soul free</i>

240
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:10,833
<i>If you ever leave
Leave a ring under a berry tree</i>

241
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:17,958
<i>When you're away
I visit saints to set my soul free...</i>

242
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,458
That's fantastic!

243
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:29,125
<i>If you ever leave
Leave a ring under a berry tree</i>

244
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,833
<i>I chant your name when I miss you...</i>

245
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:36,500
I did it!

246
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:43,042
<i>In the evenings, I kiss the moon too</i>

247
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,667
<i>I shall endure all the pain</i>

248
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,708
<i>I will never complain...</i>

249
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:49,958
Hurry up.

250
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:55,875
<i>This game called love, they say</i>

251
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,083
<i>Can't be won or lost...</i>

252
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,208
- There comes my boy.
- I am exhausted.

253
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:03,292
Hop on.

254
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:08,500
<i>Costs you your life</i>

255
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:14,250
<i>Love makes it tough to survive.</i>

256
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,792
Don't worry, I'll talk to your coach.

257
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,625
It's your birthday tomorrow.

258
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,708
I'm sure he can give you a day off.

259
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,042
Mom, nobody forced me to play hockey.

260
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:30,875
I want to play for India.
There's nothing more I could've asked for.

261
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,375
What does it matter?

262
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,417
I'll play on this birthday too,
like all my other birthdays.

263
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:36,417
Just be quiet.

264
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,500
Let me do the talking.

265
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,458
Mom...

266
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:40,708
Is it done?

267
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:43,000
Yes, getting it.

268
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,792
- Delicious.
- Here you go.

269
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,667
- Brother.
- Yes?

270
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,250
I was wondering...

271
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:59,417
It's Preeto's birthday tomorrow.

272
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:04,625
If she could get a day off
from the practice...

273
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:11,708
After Preeto's father passed away,
didn't I help Ajit find a job in London?

274
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,667
Yes, you did.

275
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,792
I'll make sure Preeto plays for India.

276
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:20,042
If she wants days off,
you can go look for another coach.

277
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,208
No...

278
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,167
I'm outside your house.

279
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,667
Meet me for five minutes.

280
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,708
Brother, I have a trial
for the Indian team next week.

281
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,833
Who is it? Ajit? I told him
that you are trying out next week.

282
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:43,167
- Why is he asking again?
- Don't give him the phone.

283
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,500
His flight leaves in two minutes.

284
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,417
In two minutes, then?

285
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,875
No, the security check
will take ten minutes.

286
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,833
But you just said two minutes.

287
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:56,917
Hello, Ajit?

288
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,167
What is it?

289
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:50,958
Just wanted to see you.

290
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,417
Why?
Don't you see me on the ground every day?

291
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,917
I don't get to see you
with your hair loose.

292
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,083
Are you done now?

293
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,167
You know Gujji, my friend?

294
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:10,042
He says I sing well.

295
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:12,625
So?

296
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:14,083
So...

297
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:17,458
I wanted to sing for you.

298
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,292
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

299
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,292
- Go ahead.
- What?

300
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:24,583
- Go on. I'm listening.
- Yes.

301
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,542
But I haven't rehearsed.

302
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,417
Your five minutes are up.

303
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:50,833
You better rehearse and come next time,
and don't you dare sing for anyone else.

304
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,208
<i>Sometimes I address her
As my guiding light</i>

305
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:58,292
<i>Sometimes I address her
As the love of my life</i>

306
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,375
<i>Lost in love, I barely survive</i>

307
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,000
<i>Don't leave me</i>

308
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,625
<i>Don't leave</i>

309
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,542
<i>Sometimes I address her
As my guiding light</i>

310
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,667
<i>Sometimes I address her
As the love of my life</i>

311
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,792
<i>Lost in love, I barely survive</i>

312
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:18,083
<i>Don't leave me Don't leave</i>

313
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:21,125
<i>I want to dwell in your eyes</i>

314
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,250
<i>I want to dwell in your eyes</i>

315
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:29,750
So that was your brother, is it?
Tell him to come in front of me

316
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,542
- or I'll break your...
- Sir.

317
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:35,792
It's my fault.

318
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,250
So it's you?

319
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,375
Bloody coward!

320
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,250
You got back to hockey for a girl!

321
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,708
You've got to slog to play for India.

322
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:47,167
You won't get an invitation

323
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,042
where they'd be obliged
to have you go play hockey.

324
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:52,208
- Sir...
- Rascal!

325
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:55,458
You'll not reach anywhere in hockey.
He thinks he's too smart.

326
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:56,958
Get out!

327
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,708
Enjoying the show, are you?

328
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:03,542
Don't you dare call her again.

329
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,542
Get back to hockey you all.

330
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:13,417
You don't need to go with her.

331
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:18,125
If I don't, the coach won't let her in.

332
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,083
I came to apologize.

333
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,125
If you are done, you can leave.

334
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,750
Hear me out, please.

335
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:44,833
Shoot.

336
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:47,667
Look here.

337
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:51,292
You are making me lose my cool.

338
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:55,417
You are being quite civil. If I were you,
I would've not stopped at words.

339
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,625
What would you do if you were in my place?

340
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,833
Then I'd take a lesson from your brother.

341
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,875
Bikramjeet is going to play for India.

342
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,292
You don't even have a place
secured in the University Team.

343
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:11,500
- What can I expect from you?
- I'm putting in all my efforts in hockey.

344
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,958
I've taken a beating from Mr. Kartar
for 12 long years.

345
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:17,375
I didn't even realize how time ran out.

346
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:19,375
I never made it to the team.

347
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,542
You think you'll make it in hockey,
starting at this age?

348
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:23,708
What if I do?

349
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:31,167
Come back when you make it
and get yourself a job.

350
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:35,625
Harpreet is getting late for her practice.

351
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,125
Let's go, Preeto.

352
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:00,458
This isn't the last trial.
There'll be many more.

353
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,708
- I'll make sure you get selected.
- But what happened this time?

354
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:07,458
That doesn't matter.
I didn't get selected, that's it.

355
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:13,333
Now will someone tell me about Sandeep?

356
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:17,667
Sunny was going for hockey as an excuse
to meet some girl apparently.

357
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,917
Hockey wasn't just an excuse.

358
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,000
Shall I tell your stories?

359
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,167
Why are you dragging me into this?

360
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:31,083
Is Sandeep all right?

361
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,667
This is his problem.

362
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,625
If Sandeep gets in trouble,

363
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:42,375
he'll forget his own problems
and run after him.

364
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,542
Stop the car.

365
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:48,125
Sandeep is at the farm.

366
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:50,417
Go meet him.

367
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:02,583
Brother!

368
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,125
Look at me.

369
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:10,917
Look up.

370
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:16,833
I heard about your trial.

371
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:19,583
Are you okay?

372
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,167
Do you love her?

373
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,208
You'll get selected the next time.

374
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:30,292
For sure.

375
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,542
Should I talk to her family?

376
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:37,750
I already did.

377
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:43,333
When I make it big in hockey, get a job,
only then will I show them my face.

378
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,167
Job!

379
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:49,250
Dad was so hopeful

380
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,792
that I'd get selected for India
and then we could get a new house.

381
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,167
So that he could retire.

382
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:01,125
My time's up, Sunny.

383
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:04,875
Now this isn't possible.

384
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:10,208
It was all going fine until yesterday.

385
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:14,792
Now it feels like nothing will get better.

386
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,625
You have more of these balls?

387
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,583
- Yes, why?
- Where are they?

388
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:40,958
Over there.

389
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,083
- What happened?
- Stay there.

390
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,375
- Hit the ball.
- But the birds are gone..

391
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,458
Forget the birds, just hit the ball.

392
00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:58,958
Go on.

393
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,167
No.

394
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,375
Hit it just like you did before.

395
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:06,750
Come back.

396
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:09,875
Go.

397
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:26,708
Come back.

398
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,417
Now hit both of them.

399
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,167
What's going on?

400
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,417
Hit them.

401
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:52,167
What the...

402
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,125
You promised to show up before them...

403
00:28:58,292 --> 00:29:01,083
only after you become a successful
hockey player, right?

404
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,875
Yes, so?

405
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,417
Wash your face, then.

406
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,875
You have to show your face very soon.

407
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:10,708
How?

408
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:14,458
With your drag flick!

409
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,917
Give me that.

410
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:21,000
Get a ball.

411
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Place it here.

412
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:27,417
When you run in like this...

413
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:31,167
dragging the ball with the stick

414
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:36,042
and then, hit the ball...
it is called a flick...

415
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,167
This is a drag flick?

416
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:49,000
Ever since uncle told me to keep
the birds away from the crops,

417
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,667
this is how I've been doing it.

418
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:53,292
This is the most difficult shot in hockey.

419
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,333
Even a good player takes years
to get it right.

420
00:29:57,042 --> 00:29:59,625
And if you can hit it right
on this surface, then...

421
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:01,542
Then?

422
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:06,083
Then probably, one of our father's sons
could still play for India.

423
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:15,583
- But how will India come to know about me?
- From Patiala.

424
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,250
Shall we?

425
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,292
Take your stick, mister.

426
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:27,958
- Are you sure that's a drag flick?
- Yes, it is.

427
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:33,958
That's the building.

428
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,375
IIS, Patiala.

429
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,958
Go left.

430
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:41,167
Go left! Sukhi, lose the cover, go for it.

431
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:44,542
- Someone's here to meet you.
- Can't you see the practice is on?

432
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,583
Sorry for disturbing you, sir.

433
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:53,417
Sir! Welcome. What would I do
without the Hockey Federation!

434
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,333
I would've been a mere physical trainer
at some high school in Patna.

435
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,625
You underestimate yourself, Coach.

436
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,500
All thanks to you guys.

437
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:03,458
Excuse me?

438
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,083
Nothing. Tell me.

439
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,542
Mr. Harry.

440
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:11,833
You need to give a lecture on sports
and its impact on young minds

441
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,625
at Chandigarh University,
tomorrow evening.

442
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:18,167
Who ditched you at the last moment
that you had to come begging to me?

443
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,167
I told the Chairman that you'd know.

444
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,458
Cover him!

445
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:26,875
I'll take it as confirmed?

446
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,875
Sir, you know it's family time for me
in the evenings.

447
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,167
It's the Chairman's order.

448
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,583
Let him know...

449
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:50,000
I'll be there.

450
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:52,083
Sure, Coach.

451
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:53,667
All good, Coach?

452
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,292
What brings you here?

453
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,083
This is my younger brother, Sandeep.

454
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,000
Does he also need a lecture?

455
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:01,042
No.

456
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,333
Have a look at his drag flick.

457
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
He's very good at it.

458
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,958
- Which state?
- University, sir.

459
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,417
Why are you wasting my time?

460
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,500
I deserve a chance, sir.

461
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,083
Should I try out
university players of this country?

462
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,875
And give lectures at colleges?
Will you prepare the team for Olympics?

463
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,208
If I'm worth it, you'll get a good player.

464
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:23,792
And if I'm not,

465
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:26,625
you can vent out
all the frustration at me.

466
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,542
Bad luck.

467
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:33,167
Manpreet.

468
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:35,333
Come to the goalpost.

469
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:45,667
Let's get done with this.

470
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:48,542
Follow me.

471
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:56,417
What is it?

472
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,125
Why did you stop?

473
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,500
Do you want the Indian team's goalkeeper?

474
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:06,667
It's for the Indian team, so I'd rather be
tested by the Indian team's goalkeeper.

475
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:07,750
Sunny!

476
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:10,500
You know how they say it in my village?

477
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,333
"Make them run and make them bleed."

478
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:15,083
Don't you worry.

479
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,375
Only curses for you, no blood.

480
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,250
You, however,

481
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,667
will not be spared for wasting my time,
despite being a senior.

482
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:28,667
I shall make you run, and make you bleed.

483
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,375
Kamaldeep.

484
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:37,708
Come here, my boy.

485
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,042
Good.

486
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,208
You can go and rest.

487
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,833
You seem to be too small for him.

488
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:06,125
Keep focusing.

489
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:11,042
All good now, or do you also need
Dhanraj Pillay to wish you luck?

490
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:13,083
I'll give him a call.

491
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:20,083
Give it to me.

492
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,667
He who utters shall be happy, fulfilled...

493
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,083
Eternal is the Holy.

494
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:40,333
Go, Sunny.

495
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,333
If he can hit such a drag flick
on the grass, what will he do on the turf?

496
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,167
He'll tear up the net on the turf.

497
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:02,667
Hitting it hard isn't enough.

498
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:06,292
If you hit a goal
using the right technique,

499
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:08,125
then no one can keep you out.

500
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:11,958
Sir, I'll do the hard work
if you teach me the technique.

501
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:13,708
But how would that help?

502
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:17,583
To hit 20 drag flicks,
you would only need 5 minutes

503
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:19,625
in a 70-minute long match.

504
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:23,167
What do I do with you
for the rest of the time? Mollycoddle you?

505
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:26,667
- You'll have to become a defender.
- Make me one.

506
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,625
It's family time for him now.

507
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:32,167
Be on the ground at five.

508
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:36,333
Be a minute late
and I'll make you run and bleed.

509
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:38,917
- Sunny!
- Brother!

510
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,417
Go, live my dream.

511
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:57,125
<i>Face your fate without a fright</i>

512
00:35:57,583 --> 00:36:00,750
<i>Live less...</i>

513
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,708
You're on time.

514
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,833
<i>Fight, for tomorrow belongs to you...</i>

515
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,667
You need strength in your legs
to play hockey.

516
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:27,083
<i>Be strong, you have to survive too...</i>

517
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:32,125
Go...

518
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:34,458
The basic rule of being a defender...

519
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:37,375
Ball in your "D" is like a bomb.
What is it?

520
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:38,458
- Bomb!
- Yes!

521
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,125
Get rid of it quickly.

522
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,167
It's like your girlfriend.

523
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,167
Don't let the opposing team near it.

524
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,708
- Right, partner?
- Yes.

525
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,458
India's jersey.

526
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,208
Mom. How does it look?

527
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:54,542
<i>The heart soared but didn't score</i>

528
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:58,958
<i>Score a goal and let the heart soar</i>

529
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Open up...

530
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,250
Never commit on the ball
until the last second.

531
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,583
- It's as good as committing suicide.
- Right.

532
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:10,625
Well done! Come on...

533
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,417
<i>Flicker Singh! Flicker Singh!</i>

534
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,208
<i>Our hockey king!</i>

535
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:16,417
<i>Flicker Singh! Flicker Singh!</i>

536
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,375
<i>Our hockey king...</i>

537
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,917
If you play like this, the opponent's
knickers will be in a twist. Say what?

538
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,667
- Knickers will be in a twist.
- Yes. Go, one more.

539
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:28,208
Action on reaction. Use your brain.

540
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:31,417
Don't think like a buffalo,
think like a criminal.

541
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,417
<i>What's happening around
Shouldn't bother you...</i>

542
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,125
Go, go, come on.

543
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,167
Five seconds.

544
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,208
Very good.

545
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:39,625
Go back.

546
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:43,375
<i>You need to reach your goal...</i>

547
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,667
Come back, Sandeep. Forget that.

548
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,958
Concentrate on defense. Come back.

549
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:50,917
<i>What's happening around
Shouldn't bother you</i>

550
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:56,333
<i>You have to flow like a raging river too</i>

551
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:58,250
<i>You need to reach your goal...</i>

552
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:00,458
India! India!

553
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:04,333
Hockey! India!

554
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,125
Hold it tight.

555
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,125
<i>Flicker Singh</i>

556
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:12,375
<i>Forget everything else</i>

557
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:17,292
<i>Your thought was great, I must say</i>

558
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:22,750
<i>I met you midway...</i>

559
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:25,042
Three, two, one.

560
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:29,542
<i>Don't stop at the shore</i>

561
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:34,083
<i>Keep swimming, stay afloat</i>

562
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:39,125
<i>The currents will lead you, I am sure</i>

563
00:38:58,042 --> 00:39:00,042
Booked your train tickets already?

564
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:03,042
Beg your pardon?

565
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,125
Don't worry if you haven't.

566
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:10,083
The Federation can always send you
in the luggage compartment.

567
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:14,375
I know the Federation's rule.
We are not allowed to play at night.

568
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,042
So, then?

569
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,167
if I don't score goals,
I'll not get selected.

570
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,917
I defend goals the entire day.

571
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:26,292
I thought I'd practice in the night.

572
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:30,917
I'd rather take a risk
and get selected in the team

573
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,875
than not take any risks and go back home.

574
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:43,500
Who the hell is he!

575
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,292
Running around like this won't help you.

576
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:50,500
What do you mean?

577
00:39:56,833 --> 00:40:00,333
The Federation won't hold you accountable
for any of these balls.

578
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:02,292
And you are?

579
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,208
I am the Federation.

580
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,542
It's an honor, Mr. Chairman.

581
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:27,667
The match starts.

582
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,708
The Meerut versus Patiala match has begun.

583
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,292
I see guns in the hands of the audiences.

584
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:42,667
<i>After dodging Harmeet,
he passed the ball to the center forward.</i>

585
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,833
<i>And... that's Meerut's first goal!</i>

586
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:47,167
<i>Nailed it!</i>

587
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,000
<i>Harmeet from the Patiala team is injured.</i>

588
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:52,708
Sir, allow me.

589
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:54,167
Go.

590
00:40:54,667 --> 00:41:00,000
<i>The injured Harmeet has been replaced
by number four jersey, Sandeep Singh.</i>

591
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,750
This is Meerut, mister.

592
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:04,417
<i>Prakash welcomes Sandeep
by hitting with the ball.</i>

593
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:06,292
<i>Sandeep Singh appeals.</i>

594
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,833
- Sandeep.
- <i>Meerut trying to pressurize Patiala.</i>

595
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:14,375
<i>But don't you underestimate Patiala,
Mr. Nadeem.</i>

596
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:16,000
Sandeep, leave it.

597
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,875
<i>Sandeep might get a yellow card.</i>

598
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:26,333
<i>The referee seems like a landline phone
in the times of mobiles.</i>

599
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:29,875
You better put that gun
back into your knickers.

600
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,750
I come from Bihar.

601
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:36,667
I can spit and make a hole
in your forehead.

602
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,750
His spit, not mine.

603
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:50,417
<i>Patiala zero, Meerut one.</i>

604
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,083
<i>A good pass by Sandeep
to the center forward.</i>

605
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:56,083
<i>Number 19 is dragging the ball
towards the "D".</i>

606
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:57,125
<i>And...</i>

607
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:59,125
<i>And a foul for hitting inside the "D".</i>

608
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:02,792
<i>Short-corner for Patiala, Mr. Nadeem.</i>

609
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:06,042
- Hello, sir.
- <i>First chance for Patiala to score a goal.</i>

610
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:07,167
Sir?

611
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:11,750
I'm looking out for players
for the Junior Indian team.

612
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:17,917
<i>And Sandeep Singh
will take the short-corner.</i>

613
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:21,125
Isn't he the one who practices at night?

614
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,125
Yes, sir.

615
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:25,500
<i>Sandeep Singh ready
to play the short-corner.</i>

616
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:27,292
<i>Vijay makes a pass.</i>

617
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:29,292
<i>Golden opportunity for Patiala.</i>

618
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:31,250
<i>Sandeep Singh flicks</i>

619
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:33,083
<i>and scores a goal!</i>

620
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:35,083
<i>- The score is one all, Mr. Nadeem.</i>
- Yes!

621
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:40,208
That fast a drag flick on the grass!
On the turf...

622
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:42,417
He'd tear through the net
on the turf, sir.

623
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:52,250
<i>Another goal for Patiala
from the Penalty Corner.</i>

624
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:54,250
<i>Patiala three, Meerut one.</i>

625
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:05,458
<i>Sandeep Singh
has been scoring goals non-stop.</i>

626
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,917
<i>Plays great defense as well.</i>

627
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:14,417
<i>Mr. Nadeem, another goal for Patiala.</i>

628
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:18,750
So, should I recommend him?

629
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:21,458
He's a temperamental player.

630
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:23,542
He could get disqualified easily.

631
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:26,375
Sandeep...

632
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:30,417
However, he can be a huge asset
even if he plays for only 15 minutes.

633
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,667
Sandeep...

634
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,333
Then prepare him to last for 70 minutes.

635
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:37,792
- The game will be over in fi <i>ve minutes.</i>
- Yes, sir.

636
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:39,875
<i>Patiala leading with six goals.</i>

637
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:41,125
<i>Mr. Nadeem!</i>

638
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:44,708
<i>Spectators are getting more enthusiastic
for Patiala.</i>

639
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,500
<i>Sandeep Singh has another chance.</i>

640
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:51,792
<i>Will he score his eighth goal here?
Audience is excited.</i>

641
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,542
<i>And Indian player, Harpreet Kaur,
seems to have arrived here.</i>

642
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:58,458
<i>She played a great game
against Germany yesterday.</i>

643
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:03,417
Sandeep...

644
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:07,375
<i>The young lad got distracted
and missed the goal.</i>

645
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:13,083
A great save by Meerut.

646
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:15,667
You should sit back and relax now.

647
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:17,500
The match is over.

648
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:19,625
Meerut has lost the game

649
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:21,542
in spite of saving this goal.

650
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:26,708
Well played, Sandeep Singh.

651
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:29,792
You distracted me.

652
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:32,417
Had you come earlier
you could've seen me score.

653
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:35,042
Then you would've
probably missed all the goals.

654
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:37,042
That's right.

655
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,417
You better not watch me play ever.

656
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:49,208
- What are you looking at?
- The Indian jersey looks good on you.

657
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:51,833
Looking at your progress

658
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:54,333
you better be prepared to wear one
very soon.

659
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,708
Once I get selected for India...

660
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,458
we'll have the biggest wedding in town.

661
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,833
- Followed by a honeymoon in Switzerland?
- Exactly.

662
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:07,458
- Three kids?
- Yes. Looking just like you.

663
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:08,875
Or one could be like me.

664
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,583
And which car shall we buy?

665
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,625
A sports car! The one with a sunroof.

666
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:17,208
- A new house?
- Yes.

667
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:21,583
We should have that
round, bubbling water tub...

668
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:23,958
Jacuzzi. Yes, Jacuzzi.

669
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:29,375
So many players in our town
are dying to go to Switzerland

670
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:31,167
and millions across the country.

671
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,542
There are only 11 such fools

672
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:35,083
who would not get distracted by a girl

673
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:38,042
because they aren't playing
to get a pool or a car.

674
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:40,292
They are scoring goals for India.

675
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,792
You're quite a serious kind of girl.
I'll score goals for India as well.

676
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:49,000
If I play for India...
you'll be mine, right?

677
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:59,083
Did you rehearse the song for me?

678
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,042
Yes.

679
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,667
Not really.
Couldn't spare time from hockey.

680
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:11,708
<i>Sometimes I address her
As my guiding light</i>

681
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:16,417
<i>Sometimes I address her
As the love of my life</i>

682
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,333
<i>Sometimes I address her
As my guiding light</i>

683
00:46:20,417 --> 00:46:23,458
<i>Sometimes I address her
As the love of my life</i>

684
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:26,333
<i>Lost in love, I barely survive</i>

685
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:29,625
<i>Don't leave me...</i>

686
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:32,375
<i>Sandeep scored 60 goals in three months.</i>

687
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:35,250
<i>And won eight
Man of the Tournament trophies.</i>

688
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,833
<i>For how long could Indian Hockey ignore
such a special player?</i>

689
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:46,292
- <i>Mom, is Bikram there?</i>
- Sunny?

690
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,458
How are you?

691
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:50,042
- <i>It's been so long--</i>
- Is Bikram there?

692
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:53,333
Bikram's gone
to Mr. Sharma's with your dad.

693
00:46:53,417 --> 00:46:54,708
<i>Listen...</i>

694
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:01,083
Silly boy! Hung up on me.

695
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:04,458
You're allowed only one call at a time.

696
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:06,542
You are talking to your senior.
Have some respect.

697
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:21,333
It's me, Sandeep. Is Brother Bikram there?

698
00:47:21,417 --> 00:47:22,833
No, he's not here.

699
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:24,708
Okay.

700
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:27,875
Is someone knocking at your door?

701
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:29,708
Let me check.

702
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:33,875
- Hello.
- Hello.

703
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:35,792
It's for you.

704
00:47:36,042 --> 00:47:37,375
- It's Sandeep.
- Sandeep?

705
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:38,708
- Yes.
- Give it to me.

706
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,958
Sandeep, you rascal! I've been
distributing my own wedding invites here.

707
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:47,958
Brother, I got selected for India.
I wanted you to be the first one to know.

708
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:50,000
<i>I'm going on a tour to Poland.</i>

709
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:54,125
If I make it to the finals,
I won't be able to attend the wedding.

710
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:55,792
That's not a problem.

711
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:59,333
Don't just reach the finals,
you must also win it!

712
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:00,500
Okay?

713
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:05,208
Many get selected to play for India,
but only a few last long enough.

714
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,292
<i>Don't worry about anything.</i>

715
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:10,625
We shall celebrate once you are back.

716
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:11,708
<i>Okay?</i>

717
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:15,417
Take care of yourself. Bye.

718
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:20,792
Sandeep has been selected
in the Indian Team.

719
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,083
Congratulations!

720
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:26,000
Well done!

721
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:31,042
What's with your attitude?
I'm a much senior player than you.

722
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,125
I'm a <i>kabaddi</i> player.

723
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:37,375
I got selected for India.

724
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:53,000
It's looking good on you,
the Indian jersey.

725
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
If you play well, you'll never lose it.

726
00:48:58,542 --> 00:48:59,833
Go, nail them.

727
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,542
<i>An amazing goal
in the first 15 minutes of the match!</i>

728
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,083
<i>Germany messes it up once again.</i>

729
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:33,000
<i>Temperament plays an important role
in a player's career.</i>

730
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:35,292
<i>Sandeep Singh
will have to keep that in mind.</i>

731
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:42,542
<i>Body tackle by Euan and Zgnacio</i>

732
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:45,625
<i>is an easy way to get
a player out through the yellow card.</i>

733
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:46,583
Come on.

734
00:49:47,667 --> 00:49:49,625
<i>An amazing goal by Sandeep Singh.</i>

735
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,333
Foul!

736
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:57,458
<i>He's good at his game</i>

737
00:49:57,542 --> 00:49:59,875
<i>but before you know it,
he'll pick on a fight.</i>

738
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:01,375
You can't play like this!

739
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:04,292
- Yes!
- <i>And with this goal,</i>

740
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:07,375
<i>Sandeep Singh becomes the second
highest goal scorer of the tournament.</i>

741
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:12,667
<i>Welcome to Six Nation Series Finals.</i>

742
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:14,583
<i>India versus Pakistan.</i>

743
00:50:15,042 --> 00:50:17,583
<i>The match is not just between
these two countries</i>

744
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,875
<i>but is a contest between Tanveer Alam,
the highest goal scorer so far,</i>

745
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:26,417
<i>and India's Sandeep Singh,
the second highest goal scorer.</i>

746
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:32,375
<i>Bikram, I feel if Coach Harry had managed</i>

747
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:35,750
<i>to keep Sandeep Singh on the field
in all the matches for 70 minutes</i>

748
00:50:35,917 --> 00:50:37,958
<i>it would have been a different story.</i>

749
00:50:38,042 --> 00:50:40,250
<i>Or, he could've been out
of the tournament by now</i>

750
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,292
<i>if he got another yellow card.</i>

751
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:44,958
He's changing positions.

752
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,083
Pass the ball!

753
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:50,125
Go... Move!

754
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:52,333
<i>And a sloppy pass by Harmeet.</i>

755
00:50:55,417 --> 00:50:58,375
<i>Oh, no, Sandeep Singh
just manages to dodge that.</i>

756
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:02,125
<i>It seems like Pakistan too is following
the same strategy as other teams.</i>

757
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:04,250
<i>Attacking Sandeep Singh.</i>

758
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:06,083
- Come on.
- Sandeep.

759
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,500
You have to stick around
throughout 70 minutes.

760
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:10,375
Keep your cool.

761
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:14,083
Go for it, it's moving away.

762
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:15,833
Go...

763
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:18,875
<i>Sandeep moved forward, dodging Tanveer.</i>

764
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:21,708
<i>Moving forward, he also manages
to dodge Ahmad Mushtaq.</i>

765
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:24,958
- Sandeep!
- <i>Oh, my god!</i>

766
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:26,833
<i>Sneaking in from behind,
a blow on the nose.</i>

767
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,292
Sandeep! Move back! Doctor!

768
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:33,708
- Has he fainted? Must have hit him hard.
- Are you all right?

769
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:36,083
<i>Tanveer will have to pay
the price for this.</i>

770
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:39,458
Sandeep, good job.

771
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:43,583
<i>It's a pity that both the highest
and the second highest goal scorers</i>

772
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,167
<i>are out of the game.</i>

773
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:49,125
<i>Losing a defender at this stage
could mean a huge loss to the team.</i>

774
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:51,500
<i>Pakistan will surely cash in
on this opportunity.</i>

775
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,208
<i>He has lost a lot of blood.</i>

776
00:51:53,292 --> 00:51:56,250
<i>I doubt if Sandeep will be able
to make a comeback after this.</i>

777
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:57,833
Pass...

778
00:51:57,917 --> 00:51:59,333
Pass it to Tariq.

779
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:06,375
Good. Go for it.

780
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:08,458
<i>Yusuf with the ball on center forward.</i>

781
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,333
He's coming!

782
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,500
<i>Goes straight to the goal! Fantastic goal!</i>

783
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:16,000
Go.

784
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:18,083
<i>And with that, we are at half time.</i>

785
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:22,375
<i>Just as I predicted, Pakistan is taking
advantage of India's weak defense.</i>

786
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:26,208
<i>India needs Sandeep Singh at this point.</i>

787
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:29,708
- You are not going back.
- Sir...

788
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:33,542
I've been seeing hockey
for around 20 years now.

789
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,917
They'll break you if you go back there.

790
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:40,042
- This will be the end of your career.
- My career doesn't matter.

791
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:42,750
I'm not a legend.
This is my first tournament.

792
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:44,583
I am replaceable.

793
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,958
<i>Now the second half begins.</i>

794
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,125
Go... Good job.

795
00:52:55,583 --> 00:52:56,750
- Ready?
- Yes.

796
00:52:57,875 --> 00:52:59,542
- Lobo.
- Yes, take it.

797
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:01,833
<i>Bikram! Are you seeing what I'm seeing?</i>

798
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:04,083
- Rajinder!
- <i>Sandeep Singh is back!</i>

799
00:53:10,042 --> 00:53:11,167
Best of luck.

800
00:53:15,542 --> 00:53:18,000
<i>We are already 20 minutes
into the second half.</i>

801
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:19,125
Pass ahead.

802
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,000
Hit it, hit it back.

803
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,292
<i>The center forward moves with the ball.</i>

804
00:53:26,667 --> 00:53:28,333
<i>He manages to get to the "D",
Nitin cuts in</i>

805
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:30,583
<i>and India gets a short-corner.</i>

806
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,125
<i>India gets its first short-corner.</i>

807
00:53:33,417 --> 00:53:36,500
<i>It seems like Sandeep Singh's entry
has changed the game.</i>

808
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:38,750
Yusuf, cross the angle.

809
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:44,292
<i>That's an amazing
backward pass to Harmeet.</i>

810
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:47,042
<i>And Harmeet's slap-shot
straight into the goal.</i>

811
00:53:51,292 --> 00:53:52,667
We're in trouble.

812
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:56,167
<i>Like a true warrior!</i>

813
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,792
- We didn't get him.
- Look!

814
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,375
<i>Ninety seconds to go.</i>

815
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:08,917
Pass the ball.

816
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,750
Go...

817
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:16,625
<i>A 360 degree dodge by Sandeep!</i>

818
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:19,417
It's a foul.

819
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,833
<i>Fantastic partnership
between Sandeep and Nitin.</i>

820
00:54:21,917 --> 00:54:23,875
<i>And there, India gets
its second short-corner!</i>

821
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:26,333
He will again beat them.

822
00:54:27,417 --> 00:54:31,000
If Sandeep scores another goal,
he'll become the highest goal scorer.

823
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:34,500
He will, for sure. He could also become
the player of the tournament.

824
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:37,583
Sandeep, we have to win the match.

825
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:42,083
Sandeep...

826
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:44,750
Sandeep...

827
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:49,667
Sandeep...

828
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:53,000
<i>T hat's a fantastic goal!</i>

829
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:56,792
<i>A historic win for India
in the Six Nation Series Finals.</i>

830
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:59,875
<i>Look at the speedometer.
Sandeep has broken his own record.</i>

831
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:03,042
<i>His last drag flick was recorded
to be 108 kilometers per hour.</i>

832
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:06,917
<i>And this goal was drag flicked
at the speed of 120 kilometers per hour.</i>

833
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:09,875
<i>After this supersonic drag flick,</i>

834
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:13,000
<i>this new boy should be renamed as</i>

835
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:15,792
<i>Flicker Singh instead of Sandeep Singh.</i>

836
00:55:16,042 --> 00:55:18,292
<i>Yes, Flicker Singh!</i>

837
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:20,875
<i>Our hockey king</i>

838
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:25,375
<i>Flicker Singh! Flicker Singh!
Our hockey king</i>

839
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,542
Sandeep Singh.

840
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,125
My son, Zorawar.
He wants to be a hockey player like you.

841
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:32,583
- Great.
- Autograph, please.

842
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:33,625
Of course.

843
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:35,042
Here you go, dear.

844
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:43,917
God bless you.

845
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:46,375
Are you doing all right?

846
00:55:46,583 --> 00:55:47,667
What happened to your nose?

847
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:48,625
Nothing much.

848
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,208
Listen.

849
00:55:50,292 --> 00:55:53,417
They haven't printed much about you
in Punjabi newspapers.

850
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:57,125
Whatever little they have,
it's about some Flicker Singh.

851
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:59,500
You told us that you scored
most of the goals.

852
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:01,083
Yes, that's me. I am Flicker Singh.

853
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:02,167
- What?
- Look at this.

854
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:04,042
The media has given me a new name.

855
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:09,375
- "Flicker Singh scores maximum..."
- Sir.

856
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:13,292
Sir, you became the highest goal scorer
in your first international series.

857
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:15,500
- How does that feel?
- I feel good.

858
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:16,792
He feels good, very good.

859
00:56:16,917 --> 00:56:18,333
I am also feeling very good.

860
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,625
I am his father. And he is my son.

861
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:22,708
Look at his photo in the newspaper.

862
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:24,125
He looks so handsome, doesn't he?

863
00:56:24,292 --> 00:56:26,042
We live in a town called Shahbad.

864
00:56:26,125 --> 00:56:28,333
And the camera...
Sorry, just a little to the...

865
00:56:28,417 --> 00:56:32,042
So, we live in Shahabad, and he has been
playing hockey since his childhood.

866
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:34,875
And look at him,
he's made us so proud today.

867
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:36,750
When will this appear on TV?

868
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:38,250
On which channel will it be aired?

869
00:56:41,917 --> 00:56:42,958
Are you happy now?

870
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:45,542
Very happy.

871
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:50,000
I am happier than Mogambo has ever been.

872
00:56:52,792 --> 00:56:54,208
Okay, hold this.

873
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:58,042
I have some news for you too.

874
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,792
Take this.

875
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:08,125
Go on. Read it.

876
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:19,792
The letter arrived at home
soon after your selection.

877
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:22,208
You've got the job!

878
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:29,375
And here's my resignation.

879
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:34,250
Shahbad is here. Shahbad...

880
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:39,375
I've said my final goodbyes
to Yellow Printers.

881
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:41,542
Shahbad...

882
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:46,125
Shahbad...

883
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:51,250
- We've reached.
- Shahbad's here.

884
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:53,000
Get down. Stop the bus for us.

885
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:56,042
- Hop on. Come.
- You go ahead. I'll be back soon.

886
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:58,458
- Come home first.
- I'll be right back. See you.

887
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:04,125
Flicker Singh! Do you remember
the address to your new house?

888
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:09,917
Bani never scores a goal.

889
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:12,833
- She's a goalkeeper, Mom.
- Hello.

890
00:58:13,042 --> 00:58:14,083
Hello, dear.

891
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:18,250
No matter where they make you stand,
you always score a goal.

892
00:58:18,417 --> 00:58:19,708
Come on, Mom.

893
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:23,708
Preet.

894
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:29,000
Hello.

895
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:33,083
Ajit had asked me to see you only when
I earn a name for myself in hockey.

896
00:58:43,042 --> 00:58:44,958
What's this? What should I do with this?

897
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:46,417
It's not for you.

898
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,750
Idiot, you got the job because
you are part of the team now.

899
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,917
Once you are out of the team,
you will be on my mercy.

900
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,750
He scored 16 goals, sir.

901
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:59,417
The Indian team doesn't have
a better drag flicker than him.

902
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:01,917
Chances of him
being dropped are slim, sir.

903
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,542
Zip it up. Just zip it up.

904
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,208
You played for India under my training.

905
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:08,542
- Don't you forget that.
- I played for India

906
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,542
without your training.

907
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:13,875
So, I'm sure others can manage too.
You too shouldn't forget that.

908
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:17,667
Do you want her to play for India,
or get married and stay at home?

909
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,083
No.

910
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:22,417
She will continue to play
even after our marriage...

911
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:25,292
if we have your support.

912
00:59:27,042 --> 00:59:29,750
- Give me my hockey stick!
- Don't bother.

913
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:37,417
Last time, I didn't say a word
to save Preet from your beating

914
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,083
as I was your student then.

915
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:43,417
This time, you won't be the only one
using the hockey stick.

916
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:46,417
And let alone getting you snacks,

917
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,292
none will bother to get you water.

918
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:52,583
Get lost! Get back! Back on the ground.

919
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:08,750
Welcome, my brave lad.

920
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:16,042
The new star player of
the Indian hockey team will be greeted

921
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:19,958
to our new house by the new member
of our family, our daughter-in-law.

922
01:00:20,167 --> 01:00:22,000
- Applause...
- <i>Mr. Sandeep Singh</i>

923
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:24,333
<i>The new shining star of Indian Hockey</i>

924
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:27,792
<i>The talk of the town is back</i>

925
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:29,583
<i>Welcome home</i>

926
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:31,375

<i>Welcome</i>

930

<i>Welcome</i>

931
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:40,542

<i>Welcome</i>

936
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:49,708
<i>Welcome</i>

937
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:54,125
<i>The young lad is back from the hunt</i>

938
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:56,292
<i>He's a fearless huntsman</i>

939
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:00,125
<i>He scares away the doe</i>

940
01:01:00,292 --> 01:01:01,542
<i>He rides a lion</i>

941
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:03,333
<i>He's a fearless huntsman</i>

942
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,333
<i>Let's have a bet, there's no backing out</i>

943
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:09,083
<i>Royal style, royal life</i>

944
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:11,083
<i>He flirts with beauties</i>

945
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,792
<i>Everything about him is unique</i>

946
01:01:12,917 --> 01:01:16,083
<i>Let's have a bet, there's no backing out</i>

947
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:18,167
<i>He flirts with beauties</i>

948
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:20,417
<i>Everything about him is unique</i>

949
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:24,083
<i>It's a pleasure to know him</i>

950
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:27,417
<i>He is my life, my buddy</i>

951
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,000
<i>Can give up the world for him, my brother</i>

952
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:32,458
<i>Good man</i>

953
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,333
<i>Good man</i>

954
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:36,542
<i>Good man, the Samaritan</i>

<i>Good man</i>

<i>Samaritan, a good man</i>

963
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:19,500
<i>Make some noise</i>

964
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:21,375
<i>Get yourself heard</i>

965
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:24,625
<i>It's time you inform the world</i>

966
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:28,333
<i>And beloved, replied the world to it</i>

967
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:32,083
<i>Here comes a force to reckon with</i>

968
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:36,417
<i>Let's have a bet, there's no backing out
Royal style, royal life</i>

<i>He is my life, my love</i>

972
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:50,958
<i>Can give up the world for him</i>

<i>Welcome</i>

994
01:03:55,542 --> 01:03:57,708
I have a trial in the morning.
I must leave.

995
01:04:05,792 --> 01:04:06,667
What?

996
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:10,083
Well...

997
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:15,750
Nothing.

998
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:17,958
Say it.

999
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:26,167
I won't be able to stop if I start.

1000
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:30,167
Say it.

1001
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:32,333
No one will stop you.

1002
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,208
I can hear you.

1003
01:04:51,417 --> 01:04:52,583
Really?

1004
01:04:53,333 --> 01:04:55,542
You've got a lifetime
to tell me whatever you want to.

1005
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:00,917
Go, play the World Cup first.

1006
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:08,333
I'll do my best.

1007
01:05:10,667 --> 01:05:12,542
- Don't see my matches.
- I won't.

1008
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:16,375
I didn't see the Poland tournament
and you became the highest scorer.

1009
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,250
You must win this one.

1010
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:39,750
Once I am back from the World Cup,
we'll all go for a vacation to Shimla.

1011
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:43,083
- Remember the last vacation?
- Did we ever go for one?

1012
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,833
You were three years old
when dad took us all to Delhi.

1013
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:48,542
We didn't have money,
we had to stay in the same room.

1014
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:49,833
Sunny! You are late.

1015
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:52,042
- All five of us in the same room?
- Yes.

1016
01:05:52,417 --> 01:05:55,125
You were fine, sleeping on the bed
with mom and dad.

1017
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,208
I had to sleep on the floor with grandma.

1018
01:05:57,542 --> 01:05:59,125
We'll book 3 rooms when we go to Shimla.

1019
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:01,417
Take this.

1020
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,583
- Watch it! Be careful, man!
- Sorry.

1021
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:07,042
It's okay. No worries.

1022
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:10,208
- Hail Almighty.
- Hail Almighty.

1023
01:06:10,292 --> 01:06:11,167
Go.

1024
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:16,208
What shall I get you?

1025
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:19,833
Just win the gold.

1026
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:28,083
Sandeep, you must have
a lot of girlfriends.

1027
01:06:28,167 --> 01:06:30,000
- Give me a girl's number.
- Sunny!

1028
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:31,042
Let's go, Sunny.

1029
01:06:31,292 --> 01:06:33,167
Cheeku has got a seat for you there.

1030
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:34,875
Let it be. I'm comfortable here.

1031
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:36,958
Don't irritate me now.
Let's go and sit there.

1032
01:06:37,042 --> 01:06:38,958
- Come on.
- Okay, bye.

1033
01:06:39,042 --> 01:06:39,875
Okay.

1034
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:43,000
Let's go.

1035
01:06:49,667 --> 01:06:51,875
- Come on.
- She's so cute.

1036
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:57,750
- Here.
- Keep this.

1037
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:03,208
- I wore it as a child.
- Fine.

1038
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:06,667
This one, it's from our uncle.

1039
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:08,583
- Don't bother...
- How much for this?

1040
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:09,917
He's a miser. Let me check.

1041
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:11,792
Your family is full of misers.

1042
01:07:12,042 --> 01:07:13,542
And your family is so generous, right?

1043
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:14,583
Yes, comparatively.

1044
01:07:14,667 --> 01:07:15,833
Forget it. I know.

1045
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:17,000
- Sunny?
- Yes.

1046
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:19,917
I always take this seat
whenever I'm on a tour.

1047
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,625
- Okay.
- It's lucky for me.

1048
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:23,250
You even had a girlfriend named Lucky.

1049
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:24,375
She left you, didn't she?

1050
01:07:24,542 --> 01:07:26,208
And he bought the tickets for her.

1051
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:27,542
Sunny, come and sit here.

1052
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:28,667
Let me settle the score.

1053
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,792
- Sure.
- Just remain seated. Don't drag this.

1054
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:33,917
- Remain seated.
- I don't care. Come and sit here.

1055
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,333
- Okay. There you go.
- Your relatives didn't give us anything.

1056
01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:38,958
All of this was gifted by my family.

1057
01:07:39,042 --> 01:07:41,542
Yes, some old empty bottles
of supplements!

1058
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,125
What the hell! You call this a gift?

1059
01:07:44,208 --> 01:07:46,208
- What can I say?
- You're very rich, aren't you?

1060
01:07:46,292 --> 01:07:49,125
- Did her father come? Let me check...
- Excuse me.

1061
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:51,208
Yes?

1062
01:07:52,292 --> 01:07:54,583
- Did you board the train from Shahbad?
- Yes.

1063
01:07:55,042 --> 01:07:55,917
Why?

1064
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,667
So, you got married in Shahbad.

1065
01:07:58,333 --> 01:08:00,000
- Good.
- What's your problem, man?

1066
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:02,792
I am Sandeep Singh.
Team India's hockey player.

1067
01:08:02,917 --> 01:08:05,083
- How does that concern us?
- I too am from Shahbad.

1068
01:08:05,167 --> 01:08:07,292
Oh, is that you?

1069
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:10,625
What do they call you these days
in the newspapers?

1070
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:13,750
- Flicker Singh.
- Yes, Flicker Singh.

1071
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:15,500
- Yes.
- I saw your picture.

1072
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:16,917
You looked cute.

1073
01:08:17,417 --> 01:08:18,708
Neetu, come on this side.

1074
01:08:20,125 --> 01:08:21,958
- Come on, get up.
- Hey...

1075
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,125
- Drop it.
- Fine.

1076
01:08:26,542 --> 01:08:27,875
Listen. What is it?

1077
01:08:27,958 --> 01:08:29,542
I am planning to get married soon.

1078
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:31,708
- That's why I asked.
- Okay.

1079
01:08:31,792 --> 01:08:35,750
- Okay, why don't you give me an autograph!
- Okay.

1080
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:37,958
- What are you doing, Neetu?
- Just a minute.

1081
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:39,708
Where's the pen? Here it is.

1082
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:41,042
Here you go.

1083
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:46,542
- What is your name?
- Neetu.

1084
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:48,042
- Neetu?
- Yes.

1085
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,917
- Dear Neetu!
- Yes.

1086
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,167
Don't forget to mention Balveer as well.

1087
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:53,667
Of course,

1088
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:56,250
Balveer will always be there
along with Neetu.

1089
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,583
Okay. "Dear Neetu

1090
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:02,292
- and Balveer."
- When are you getting married?

1091
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:04,542
If I could, I would get married today.

1092
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:07,333
In the train?

1093
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:09,708
- Soon.
- Okay.

1094
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:14,417
"Happy married life."

1095
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:18,042
"Sandeep Singh."

1096
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:24,292
- Sir...
- Sunny! What's wrong?

1097
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:26,125
- Sunny!
- Sunny! What happened?

1098
01:09:26,417 --> 01:09:28,917
- Sunny...
- Sunny!

1099
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,875
- Sunny...
- Sunny! What happened to you?

1100
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:34,833
- Sunny?
- Sir?

1101
01:09:37,708 --> 01:09:39,333
I didn't shoot you on purpose.

1102
01:09:39,417 --> 01:09:41,333
- You didn't do it on purpose?
- I didn't know!

1103
01:09:41,417 --> 01:09:42,958
You didn't do it on purpose?

1104
01:09:43,042 --> 01:09:44,167
Cheeku! Cheeku!

1105
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:46,292
- Sunny!
- Sir?

1106
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:49,625
Sunny, get up. Sunny...

1107
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:51,333
Cheeku! Go and stop the train.

1108
01:09:51,417 --> 01:09:53,917
I'll page them. You be with him.

1109
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,083
I didn't realize
there was a bullet in the chamber.

1110
01:09:57,833 --> 01:09:59,667
- Sunny, what happened?
- Sir...

1111
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:01,625
It's going to be okay.

1112
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:02,917
Hold on, Sunny.

1113
01:10:03,125 --> 01:10:05,375
Sunny, you'll be fine. Hold on.

1114
01:10:05,458 --> 01:10:07,125
Cheeku, stop the train!

1115
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,958
You will be fine. Don't worry.

1116
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:11,375
Keep your eyes open, Sunny.

1117
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:14,625
Keep them open.

1118
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:35,042
Brother, if I don't go play,
I'll be out of the team.

1119
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:36,875
And the job...

1120
01:10:37,917 --> 01:10:38,833
Sunny.

1121
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:41,958
Call Preet.

1122
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:44,625
Please call Preet.

1123
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,333
I'll call her.

1124
01:11:09,792 --> 01:11:11,292
The doctors seem good.

1125
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,875
Why isn't anyone telling us anything?

1126
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:24,583
Who knows if Sunny will
ever come out of coma!

1127
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:26,875
Why won't he?

1128
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,625
Of course he will.

1129
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,500
My child.

1130
01:11:58,083 --> 01:11:59,625
He'll be fine.

1131
01:12:57,792 --> 01:12:59,542
<i>According to the current market rates,</i>

1132
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,583
<i>you won't get more than this
for your house.</i>

1133
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:04,042
- It's your call now.
- We just bought it a month ago.

1134
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:07,000
How can the rates change
so much in a month?

1135
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:11,000
It's okay, Son. Let it go.

1136
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:18,167
Take this.

1137
01:13:19,208 --> 01:13:20,250
Climb up.

1138
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,292
Mr. Gurcharan, are you sure
you want to get back to your field job?

1139
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:31,333
Mr. Joshi, when I had to walk endlessly

1140
01:13:31,417 --> 01:13:36,292
carrying this 30 kilogram heavy bag,
I never felt as tired...

1141
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:42,750
as I feel now,
just sitting in the hospital.

1142
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:47,083
I don't want to lose
this habit of walking.

1143
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,500
Don't worry.

1144
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:52,083
I'll manage.

1145
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:53,917
How is Sandeep?

1146
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,417
I'm fine.

1147
01:13:55,958 --> 01:13:57,667
I asked, how is Sandeep?

1148
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,042
Sandeep...

1149
01:14:09,292 --> 01:14:10,667
Sandeep is still the same.

1150
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,875
There is no change in his condition.

1151
01:14:18,458 --> 01:14:22,000
I wonder why God did this to him.

1152
01:15:12,042 --> 01:15:13,833
Are you leaving the tour midway?

1153
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:18,208
Not only will the Federation
raise a question...

1154
01:15:19,083 --> 01:15:21,875
but I will make sure,
this is the end of your career.

1155
01:15:23,583 --> 01:15:25,208
I will face the Federation.

1156
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:27,375
And as far as my career is concerned,

1157
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:30,000
if I'm capable enough,
no one can stop me from playing.

1158
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:31,333
Not even you.

1159
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:46,417
An arrow piercing the heart...

1160
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:49,208
What does that mean?

1161
01:15:50,042 --> 01:15:51,458
It means "I love you."

1162
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:53,208
Thank you, Son.

1163
01:15:58,750 --> 01:15:59,625
"Preeti."

1164
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:05,625
Since when did you become
so popular amongst the girls?

1165
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:08,125
Sandeep has a lot of fans now.

1166
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:13,625
"I have started playing hockey
because of you."

1167
01:16:14,417 --> 01:16:19,208
"I wish to become
a drag flicker like you one day."

1168
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:23,625
Even kids are writing to you.

1169
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,083
Look at this.

1170
01:16:25,792 --> 01:16:27,000
He's drawn a picture for you.

1171
01:16:27,292 --> 01:16:28,958
A hockey stick and a ball.

1172
01:16:30,917 --> 01:16:33,458
Dad, stop reading these letters.

1173
01:16:34,042 --> 01:16:35,875
Let him have his food first.

1174
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,000
Come on.

1175
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:40,333
<i>Going over
to our sports correspondent, Suyash,</i>

1176
01:16:40,417 --> 01:16:42,458
<i>who's right outside PGI Chandigarh..</i>

1177
01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:45,833
<i>Suyash, is it true
that Sandeep Singh is out of coma?</i>

1178
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:47,833
<i>Yes, Shalini, that is true.</i>

1179
01:16:48,083 --> 01:16:50,458
<i>After 15 days,
Sandeep is finally out of coma.</i>

1180
01:16:50,542 --> 01:16:52,083
<i>His condition is improving.</i>

1181
01:16:52,167 --> 01:16:54,208
<i>- This is good news.</i>
- Why can't I turn it off?

1182
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:56,583
It's a great news for the fans.

1183
01:16:56,667 --> 01:16:59,875
<i>This means we'll soon see Sandeep Singh
back on the hockey field.</i>

1184
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:03,542
<i>Shalini, though Sandeep
has come out of coma,</i>

1185
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:05,750
<i>but the news is not good
for the hockey fans.</i>

1186
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:09,708
<i>As per the doctors, Sandeep
has been paralyzed below the waist.</i>

1187
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:13,000
<i>The hockey fans here
are terribly disheartened to know</i>

1188
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:16,000
<i>that Sandeep Singh,
the star drag flicker of the Indian team,</i>

1189
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:19,417
<i>will never be able to step
on a hockey field again.</i>

1190
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:23,125
<i>Shalini, this brings us to an important
question coming to everyone's minds.</i>

1191
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:25,417
<i>If Sandeep had received
medical treatment on time,</i>

1192
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:28,125
<i>could we have saved him
from getting paralyzed?</i>

1193
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:30,000
<i>This raises a question</i>

1194
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:32,917
<i>If an Indian hockey player
doesn't get an ambulance</i>

1195
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:39,208
<i>for six hours after being shot,
what can a common man expect?</i>

1196
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:41,500
<i>We will keep getting live updates for you.</i>

1197
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:44,333
<i>But until then, with great regret,
we have to say</i>

1198
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:47,083
<i>that Sandeep Singh, the star player
of the Indian hockey team</i>

1199
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:49,917
<i>won't be able to stand up
on his feet ever again.</i>

1200
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:53,500
- <i>That was our correspondent</i>...
- These media guys speak rubbish.

1201
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:55,375
<i>We'll see you after a short break.</i>

1202
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:58,708
<i>Keep watching
your favorite channel, Y News.</i>

1203
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:15,750
- I was going to...
- Leave.

1204
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:18,542
I was about to tell you.

1205
01:18:24,917 --> 01:18:26,208
All of you, please leave.

1206
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:32,542
My child! God! What has happened!

1207
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:43,583
Brother.

1208
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:52,042
Bikram.

1209
01:19:54,292 --> 01:19:55,375
Bikram.

1210
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,000
Bikram!

1211
01:20:29,167 --> 01:20:30,083
Sunny!

1212
01:20:30,417 --> 01:20:31,375
What happened?

1213
01:20:33,292 --> 01:20:35,542
- What's wrong?
- I've been calling out to you!

1214
01:20:36,333 --> 01:20:38,083
I had gone to get the medicines.

1215
01:20:41,042 --> 01:20:42,667
Why didn't you call the nurse?

1216
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,458
You know that I feel shy.

1217
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:47,833
I don't even let dad in.

1218
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:50,500
And you still left me alone.

1219
01:20:50,583 --> 01:20:51,542
It's my fault.

1220
01:20:52,417 --> 01:20:54,167
I'll never leave you alone.

1221
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:55,708
Okay?

1222
01:20:56,333 --> 01:20:58,750
Come on now, lie on your side.

1223
01:21:00,083 --> 01:21:00,958
A little more.

1224
01:21:01,167 --> 01:21:03,167
Move this hand. Be careful.

1225
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:04,250
Good job.

1226
01:21:04,542 --> 01:21:05,417
A little more.

1227
01:21:07,667 --> 01:21:09,083
You are my brave brother.

1228
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:11,000
What is it?

1229
01:21:11,667 --> 01:21:13,125
Nothing much has happened.

1230
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:18,542
That's it.

1231
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,500
Careful there.

1232
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:03,625
Sandeep.

1233
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:08,375
We can't make it to Switzerland now.

1234
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:11,292
Never mind.

1235
01:22:13,667 --> 01:22:15,083
We can go to Shimla instead.

1236
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:19,292
With you by my side,
Shimla will be as good as Switzerland.

1237
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:33,667
Doctors think there is a possibility
that you could get back on your feet.

1238
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,417
A very slim chance.

1239
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:40,667
And hockey is out of the question.

1240
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:48,042
It's okay.

1241
01:22:48,583 --> 01:22:50,333
I played hockey only for you.

1242
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:53,875
If I'm destined to this, so be it.

1243
01:23:00,083 --> 01:23:01,292
As long as you are with me.

1244
01:23:04,042 --> 01:23:06,417
What are you saying? You're a sportsman.

1245
01:23:09,917 --> 01:23:12,458
How can you be happy in a wheelchair?

1246
01:23:45,667 --> 01:23:47,875
<i>I thought I was going to meet
an Indian hockey player...</i>

1247
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,667
<i>who must be perhaps... shattered to know</i>

1248
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:55,875
<i>that he will never be able to play again.</i>

1249
01:23:56,042 --> 01:24:01,625
<i>But I met just another boy
who forgot everything about that.</i>

1250
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:05,542
<i>He was just happy to see me,
his Preet, by his side.</i>

1251
01:24:09,167 --> 01:24:10,042
Let's go.

1252
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:13,958
- You're sure you want to go?
- Yes, Mom. I am sure.

1253
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:27,958
I don't mind pushing a wheelchair
for the rest of my life.

1254
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,208
I will do it happily
if Sandeep is on that wheelchair.

1255
01:24:33,542 --> 01:24:36,583
But I'd be happier to see him
standing on his own two feet.

1256
01:24:38,625 --> 01:24:40,333
Even if he does so without me.

1257
01:24:44,458 --> 01:24:47,875
Are you sure he'll get back on his feet
if you are not here with him?

1258
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:48,917
No, I'm not...

1259
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:55,542
but I'm sure, he'll never
get back on his feet if I am with him.

1260
01:24:58,083 --> 01:25:02,625
You know, all that he did so far
was all for me.

1261
01:25:03,333 --> 01:25:07,833
Be it hockey, getting a job,
or getting beaten up by the coach.

1262
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:12,000
Now if he gets me...

1263
01:25:12,167 --> 01:25:15,125
He won't even bother to try
and get back on his feet.

1264
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:22,292
Okay. Final call.

1265
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:28,125
- My child!
- Come.

1266
01:25:32,292 --> 01:25:34,542
I've been asking you since long.
Where's Preet?

1267
01:25:35,167 --> 01:25:37,375
She just came to meet me once
and then disappeared.

1268
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:39,875
You didn't find out?

1269
01:25:39,958 --> 01:25:41,167
How do I find out?

1270
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:44,167
I spend the nights here with you,
and go to work during the day.

1271
01:25:46,417 --> 01:25:47,875
I hope she is okay.

1272
01:25:49,792 --> 01:25:51,250
We're going back home anyway.

1273
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:54,375
I'll find out once you settle at home.

1274
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:57,167
Okay, mister?

1275
01:26:01,042 --> 01:26:02,958
Come on, my boy. Let's go.

1276
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:21,875
Come on.

1277
01:26:23,417 --> 01:26:24,958
Good.

1278
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:29,083
My brave lad is back.

1279
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:31,958
- Thank you.
- Welcome home.

1280
01:26:32,333 --> 01:26:33,542
Let's go.

1281
01:26:44,917 --> 01:26:47,000
Thank You, God.

1282
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,042
Let's go, Mom.
You can do the crying part inside.

1283
01:26:51,167 --> 01:26:52,792
- Come, Son.
- I'm kidding.

1284
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:54,125
Come, Son. Come inside.

1285
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:56,125
Let's go, Son.

1286
01:26:56,208 --> 01:26:59,167
- Let's go inside.
- Come on.

1287
01:26:59,542 --> 01:27:01,000
Here we go.

1288
01:27:01,083 --> 01:27:02,750
Come on, everyone.

1289
01:27:03,042 --> 01:27:04,292
- Come.
- Wait.

1290
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,333
Let me set the mood right.

1291
01:27:09,167 --> 01:27:11,000
<i>Mr. Sandeep Singh</i>

1292
01:27:11,542 --> 01:27:13,750
<i>The new shining star of Indian hockey</i>

1293
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:17,042
<i>The talk of the town is back</i>

1294
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:18,917
<i>Welcome home</i>

1295
01:27:19,417 --> 01:27:20,375
<i>Welcome</i>

1296
01:27:21,333 --> 01:27:22,208
<i>Welcome</i>

1297
01:27:23,083 --> 01:27:24,042
<i>Welcome</i>

1298
01:27:24,958 --> 01:27:25,917
<i>Welcome...</i>

1299
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,958
Gurcharan, come on, dance along.

1300
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:33,292
Come on. You can do better.

1301
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:35,875
There you go!

1302
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:41,833
Join us, Son.

1303
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:43,333
<i>He rides a lion...</i>

1304
01:27:43,417 --> 01:27:45,083
Continue, Uncle.

1305
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:47,375
Come on now!

1306
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:51,250
<i>Let's have a bet, there's no backing out</i>

1307
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:55,083
<i>He flirts with beauties</i>

1308
01:27:55,167 --> 01:27:58,417
<i>It's a pleasure to know him</i>

1309
01:27:58,792 --> 01:28:01,708
<i>He is my life, my buddy</i>

1310
01:28:02,167 --> 01:28:05,583
<i>Can give up the world for him, my brother</i>

1311
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:07,500
<i>Good man</i>

1312
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:09,417
<i>Good man</i>

1313
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,125
<i>Good man, the Samaritan</i>

1314
01:28:11,292 --> 01:28:12,917
<i>Good man</i>

1315
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:15,042
<i>Good man</i>

1316
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:16,500
<i>Good man</i>

1317
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,500
<i>Good man, the Samaritan</i>

1318
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:20,167
<i>Good man</i>

1319
01:28:20,417 --> 01:28:22,208
<i>Good man, the Samaritan</i>

1320
01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:24,625
<i>Samaritan, a good man</i>

1321
01:28:48,792 --> 01:28:50,250
Answer the phone, Preet.

1322
01:28:51,083 --> 01:28:53,792
You didn't want to come to the hospital.
I can understand.

1323
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:56,667
Are you going to leave me alone
in this state?

1324
01:28:57,958 --> 01:28:59,667
Is this my fault?

1325
01:29:00,542 --> 01:29:02,083
What have I done wrong?

1326
01:29:02,167 --> 01:29:04,167
I want to hear your voice.

1327
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:25,583
I'll keep calling, Preet.

1328
01:29:26,292 --> 01:29:28,250
I will, until you answer the phone.

1329
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:31,333
Until you talk to me.

1330
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:35,375
Until you laugh when I sing.

1331
01:29:37,542 --> 01:29:40,042
I'll keep calling until you come back.

1332
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:44,625
Preet.

1333
01:30:12,542 --> 01:30:14,000
Do you want me to beg of you?

1334
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:15,958
Is that what you want?

1335
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:18,583
Get this straight.

1336
01:30:19,542 --> 01:30:21,250
When god stops answering prayers,

1337
01:30:21,417 --> 01:30:23,375
people stop believing in him.

1338
01:30:24,542 --> 01:30:25,958
I feel so embarrassed now.

1339
01:30:26,542 --> 01:30:31,000
When I was at my worst, I told you things
which I was scared to tell my own self.

1340
01:30:33,125 --> 01:30:34,375
I feel disgusted.

1341
01:30:38,125 --> 01:30:41,667
Don't you dare
come in front of me ever again.

1342
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:43,250
Sunny!

1343
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:50,167
Come on.

1344
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:52,125
Hold on to me, come on.

1345
01:32:03,792 --> 01:32:04,792
What were you doing?

1346
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:08,875
What do you want?

1347
01:32:10,917 --> 01:32:14,542
How many times did I ask you
to go find out where Preet is!

1348
01:32:15,042 --> 01:32:16,667
You are just busy doing your work.

1349
01:32:17,125 --> 01:32:18,292
What?

1350
01:32:19,125 --> 01:32:20,333
My work?

1351
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:25,375
Cleaning your shit is my work?

1352
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:27,958
Why do it and mention?

1353
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:31,000
If that's what I intended to do,
I could've listed many more things.

1354
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:33,417
And everyone here could have done so.

1355
01:32:33,875 --> 01:32:35,708
Should I thank all of you for it?

1356
01:32:35,792 --> 01:32:38,417
No one needs your acknowledgement.

1357
01:32:38,875 --> 01:32:41,125
I am working at two places
to run the house.

1358
01:32:41,375 --> 01:32:44,167
- Dad has resumed his field job.
- No, Bikram.

1359
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:47,375
Wait! He barely escaped
being run over by a train!

1360
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,625
Did you even realize that
we have come back to our old house?

1361
01:32:51,083 --> 01:32:53,375
Yes, mom sold the new house

1362
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:56,333
to pay off the expenses
for your treatment.

1363
01:32:56,708 --> 01:32:58,875
Look around you, mister!

1364
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:04,625
He wants to thank us for all of that.

1365
01:33:04,708 --> 01:33:06,792
Don't do it if it is such a trouble!

1366
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:08,042
Leave me!

1367
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:11,042
- Come on.
- No.

1368
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:13,083
- Let me take you there.
- No. Bikram...

1369
01:33:13,167 --> 01:33:15,000
- I'll take you to her house.
- No.

1370
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:17,792
She came to the hospital,
saw you in that state and ran away.

1371
01:33:17,875 --> 01:33:19,083
Her house is locked.

1372
01:33:19,167 --> 01:33:20,042
Stop it!

1373
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:24,125
Son...

1374
01:34:06,708 --> 01:34:07,583
Mom.

1375
01:34:14,958 --> 01:34:17,083
I'll see to it
that he doesn't go unpunished.

1376
01:34:17,167 --> 01:34:19,542
He shot at my child.

1377
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,333
My brave lad.

1378
01:34:23,458 --> 01:34:25,125
Don't you worry.

1379
01:34:25,917 --> 01:34:28,375
I'll make sure
he rots in prison all his life.

1380
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:30,750
I'll do anything I have to,
but I won't spare him.

1381
01:34:34,542 --> 01:34:38,458
If you really want to do something for me,
help me get back on my feet.

1382
01:34:44,292 --> 01:34:45,667
Here's your resignation letter.

1383
01:34:46,958 --> 01:34:48,208
Haven't put a date yet.

1384
01:34:51,875 --> 01:34:53,583
I want to help Bikram.

1385
01:34:55,083 --> 01:34:57,125
I want to put a date
on your resignation letter.

1386
01:34:58,125 --> 01:34:59,667
I want to get back on my feet.

1387
01:35:01,083 --> 01:35:04,125
I have already spoken
to the Chairman and Mr. Harry.

1388
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:10,667
My child has grown up into a man.

1389
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:15,125
Well done, my boy.

1390
01:35:16,167 --> 01:35:17,083
Well done.

1391
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:38,458
There... our famous captain,
Mr. Dhyan Chand.

1392
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:44,250
Today is your last day.

1393
01:35:45,292 --> 01:35:47,958
Sharma will be replacing you tomorrow.

1394
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:53,458
Rehabilitation in Holland
will cost us around 35 lakhs.

1395
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:59,042
Mr. Chairman, we are talking
about hockey here, not cricket.

1396
01:36:01,333 --> 01:36:03,083
A player is a player, sir.

1397
01:36:03,667 --> 01:36:07,667
Be it a cricket player
or a hockey player...

1398
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,417
we'll have to take a chance.

1399
01:36:10,583 --> 01:36:11,458
Yes.

1400
01:36:11,917 --> 01:36:13,917
You will take your chance and retire.

1401
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,083
It is I who will be questioned.

1402
01:36:17,083 --> 01:36:19,458
Sir, we are giving him a pension.

1403
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:23,000
And there are millions working,
sitting on a wheelchair.

1404
01:36:23,792 --> 01:36:28,417
These millions
don't play for India, Sharma.

1405
01:36:32,875 --> 01:36:36,167
Kids play cricket
in every street of this country

1406
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:41,958
with a dream that if they play for India,
then their lives will be made.

1407
01:36:42,917 --> 01:36:45,542
I agree that we aren't the Cricket Board.

1408
01:36:46,625 --> 01:36:50,750
But if we want hockey to reach
the same point where it was...

1409
01:36:53,167 --> 01:36:57,250
then we will have to
look after our players.

1410
01:36:57,375 --> 01:36:59,208
We will have to respect them.

1411
01:37:02,542 --> 01:37:03,667
Okay.

1412
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:05,750
Both of you wait outside for some time.

1413
01:37:07,833 --> 01:37:09,333
- Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.

1414
01:37:38,583 --> 01:37:40,125
<i>Preeto.</i>

1415
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:50,000
Why are you taking it so personally,
Mr. Chairman?

1416
01:37:50,875 --> 01:37:54,458
You should just retire
and leave all of this to me.

1417
01:37:55,958 --> 01:37:58,500
Why spend so much on a handicapped player?

1418
01:37:59,042 --> 01:38:01,708
That too from my budget?

1419
01:38:02,417 --> 01:38:06,208
Once I am done with you,
nothing can fix you.

1420
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:10,958
Sir, it's from the minister.

1421
01:38:29,458 --> 01:38:31,083
It isn't a favor.

1422
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:32,667
It is my duty.

1423
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:38,125
The hospital...

1424
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,625
It's okay.

1425
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:50,125
I am scared, sir.

1426
01:38:51,167 --> 01:38:52,958
Everyone is trying their best and...

1427
01:38:55,333 --> 01:38:57,250
if I don't get back on my feet...

1428
01:39:01,458 --> 01:39:03,625
Are you looking for a compliment?

1429
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:06,708
I have seen many players.

1430
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:09,333
You are a good one.

1431
01:39:10,708 --> 01:39:12,208
This is my India jersey.

1432
01:39:12,625 --> 01:39:13,917
I want it back soon.

1433
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,917
<i>He got the sanction for rehab
in just one day.</i>

1434
01:39:39,375 --> 01:39:43,000
<i>But the year that followed
was quite difficult for both of us.</i>

1435
01:39:43,833 --> 01:39:45,625
<i>Both of us were in a foreign land.</i>

1436
01:39:46,042 --> 01:39:50,667
<i>We had company and yet we were lonely.</i>

1437
01:40:35,583 --> 01:40:40,250
<i>To live without you is deceitful</i>

1438
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:45,458
<i>To live without you is difficult</i>

1439
01:40:46,292 --> 01:40:49,583
<i>Memories haunt me</i>

1440
01:40:49,667 --> 01:40:52,500
<i>Heartache taunts me</i>

1441
01:40:52,583 --> 01:40:58,083
<i>How do I convince myself?</i>

1442
01:40:58,583 --> 01:41:01,083
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1443
01:41:01,333 --> 01:41:03,875
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1444
01:41:04,417 --> 01:41:06,125
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1445
01:41:07,417 --> 01:41:09,583
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1446
01:41:38,458 --> 01:41:41,375
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1447
01:41:48,958 --> 01:41:54,583
<i>What I tried to snatch away from life
Could never be with me</i>

1448
01:41:54,667 --> 01:42:00,167
<i>From a distance
There is no regret, I believe</i>

1449
01:42:03,875 --> 01:42:09,042
<i>Leave me alone with my solitude</i>

1450
01:42:09,542 --> 01:42:15,125
<i>Don't let my anger cause any harm to you</i>

1451
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:20,083
<i>To live without you is deceitful</i>

1452
01:42:20,167 --> 01:42:21,083
<i>Without you</i>

1453
01:42:23,042 --> 01:42:25,958
<i>To live without you is deceitful</i>

1454
01:42:26,042 --> 01:42:27,083
<i>Without you</i>

1455
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:34,417
<i>Without you, how do I convince my life?</i>

1456
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:36,958
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1457
01:42:37,042 --> 01:42:40,167
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1458
01:42:41,958 --> 01:42:47,375
<i>Lord, give me the strength</i>

1459
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:53,208
<i>I am no devotee, give me devotion</i>

1460
01:42:53,292 --> 01:42:59,208
<i>Waheguru, Allah, you have many names</i>

1461
01:42:59,292 --> 01:43:04,708
<i>Waheguru, Allah, you have many names</i>

1462
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:11,125
<i>The wealth of your love, let me claim</i>

1463
01:43:42,875 --> 01:43:47,750
<i>To live without you is deceitful</i>

1464
01:43:48,583 --> 01:43:53,292
<i>To live without you is difficult</i>

1465
01:43:53,375 --> 01:43:56,625
<i>Memories haunt me</i>

1466
01:43:56,708 --> 01:43:59,833
<i>Heartache taunts me</i>

1467
01:43:59,917 --> 01:44:05,750
<i>How do I convince myself?</i>

1468
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,375
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1469
01:44:08,833 --> 01:44:10,917
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1470
01:44:11,458 --> 01:44:13,625
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1471
01:44:13,708 --> 01:44:16,667
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1472
01:44:17,542 --> 01:44:20,292
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1473
01:44:20,542 --> 01:44:22,833
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1474
01:44:23,417 --> 01:44:25,458
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1475
01:44:27,042 --> 01:44:31,250
<i>Oh, stranger</i>

1476
01:44:38,333 --> 01:44:41,875
Brother, the flight from Holland
will land at eight.

1477
01:44:41,958 --> 01:44:44,125
This idiot has brought us here at six!

1478
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:45,875
Let it be, Gurcharan.

1479
01:44:46,125 --> 01:44:49,125
He is eager to meet Sunny.
Am I right, Bikram?

1480
01:44:49,208 --> 01:44:52,250
If he is that eager,
then he should've come at four instead.

1481
01:44:54,083 --> 01:44:56,208
Where are those musicians?

1482
01:44:56,625 --> 01:45:00,042
I told you not to pay them in advance.
No one listens to me.

1483
01:45:01,167 --> 01:45:03,750
- You have called them, right?
- Of course, I did.

1484
01:45:03,833 --> 01:45:05,292
I had called them.

1485
01:45:05,458 --> 01:45:07,042
Then why didn't they show up?

1486
01:45:18,167 --> 01:45:22,375
<i>Make sure the flag hoists high</i>

1487
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:26,500
<i>My body is my country, I cry</i>

1488
01:45:26,792 --> 01:45:32,958
<i>This is what keeps me alive</i>

1489
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:38,667
<i>Don't stop at the shore</i>

1490
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:43,250
<i>Keep swimming, stay afloat</i>

1491
01:45:43,333 --> 01:45:49,167
<i>The currents will lead you, I am sure</i>

1492
01:46:06,917 --> 01:46:08,583
My child!

1493
01:46:08,667 --> 01:46:09,917
Oh, God!

1494
01:46:11,417 --> 01:46:13,083
My child!

1495
01:46:14,125 --> 01:46:15,875
Thank you, God.

1496
01:46:16,083 --> 01:46:17,208
Oh, God!

1497
01:46:57,792 --> 01:46:59,875
<i>Cleaning your shit is my work?</i>

1498
01:47:00,167 --> 01:47:01,708
<i>Why do it and mention?</i>

1499
01:47:01,792 --> 01:47:04,292
<i>If I had to do that,
I could've listed many more things.</i>

1500
01:47:04,792 --> 01:47:06,917
<i>Should I thank all of you for it?</i>

1501
01:47:08,292 --> 01:47:09,167
Sandeep.

1502
01:47:10,083 --> 01:47:11,083
Sit down.

1503
01:47:11,833 --> 01:47:12,708
Sit.

1504
01:47:21,125 --> 01:47:22,375
I am your elder brother.

1505
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,292
I know why you are here.

1506
01:47:27,917 --> 01:47:28,958
You need my help, right?

1507
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:35,333
Hold my feet and apologize.

1508
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:38,917
Go on, apologize.

1509
01:47:42,625 --> 01:47:43,833
I want to play for India.

1510
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:45,292
Please help me.

1511
01:47:52,708 --> 01:47:56,667
Do you really want to play for India,
or is it for that girl?

1512
01:47:58,625 --> 01:47:59,792
I am not that selfish.

1513
01:48:03,875 --> 01:48:06,125
I became a player for her,

1514
01:48:06,833 --> 01:48:08,292
but I went to rehab for my family.

1515
01:48:09,125 --> 01:48:11,417
And now, I want to play for India,
for our country.

1516
01:48:22,208 --> 01:48:23,125
Move.

1517
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:29,000
There is an Indian Airways tournament.

1518
01:48:30,708 --> 01:48:32,000
But there is a problem.

1519
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:33,125
What?

1520
01:48:36,542 --> 01:48:37,917
It is against my team.

1521
01:48:43,833 --> 01:48:45,542
Are you scared to play against me?

1522
01:48:49,917 --> 01:48:51,875
Idiot! It took you six months
to apologize.

1523
01:48:53,167 --> 01:48:54,833
I'll see you while I train you.

1524
01:48:57,250 --> 01:48:59,250
And I'll take my revenge on the field.

1525
01:49:14,333 --> 01:49:15,208
Okay?

1526
01:49:15,375 --> 01:49:16,250
Okay.

1527
01:49:18,417 --> 01:49:19,750
- Let's go.
- Smile.

1528
01:49:21,208 --> 01:49:22,125
Let's go, then?

1529
01:49:22,458 --> 01:49:23,333
For a run?

1530
01:49:31,792 --> 01:49:34,250
Lucky scoundrel managed
to get back on his feet.

1531
01:49:39,125 --> 01:49:41,167
<i>Behind me lurks darkness</i>

1532
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:43,167
<i>Ahead lies a storm</i>

1533
01:49:43,333 --> 01:49:46,958
<i>In this storm, I want a lamp to survive</i>

1534
01:49:51,375 --> 01:49:52,292
Let's go.

1535
01:49:53,292 --> 01:49:54,750
- Good morning.
- Good morning, boys.

1536
01:49:56,083 --> 01:49:57,833
<i>Either the heart will turn into stone</i>

1537
01:49:57,917 --> 01:50:00,292
<i>Or the heart of stone will beat</i>

1538
01:50:00,375 --> 01:50:04,125
<i>I have taken up a challenge to feel alive</i>

1539
01:50:04,208 --> 01:50:06,042
<i>Forget...</i>

1540
01:50:06,792 --> 01:50:08,458
Sunny, body play.

1541
01:50:08,583 --> 01:50:11,333
Use distraction to get the ball.
Go get it.

1542
01:50:12,833 --> 01:50:16,833
<i>Forget, the night long gone</i>

1543
01:50:17,042 --> 01:50:20,625
<i>Start afresh this morning</i>

1544
01:50:20,875 --> 01:50:23,875
Yes. Up. Left.

1545
01:50:23,958 --> 01:50:25,917
<i>From ground to sky, oh, my brother</i>

1546
01:50:27,333 --> 01:50:32,875
<i>Look up, soar high
From ground to sky, oh, my brother...</i>

1547
01:50:32,958 --> 01:50:33,875
Get it!

1548
01:50:36,292 --> 01:50:40,375
<i>They stick to their guns
These brave warriors</i>

1549
01:50:40,458 --> 01:50:44,292
<i>Handsome and charming
Our brave warriors</i>

1550
01:50:44,542 --> 01:50:48,542
<i>They stick to their guns
These brave warriors</i>

1551
01:50:48,917 --> 01:50:52,750
<i>Handsome and charming
Our brave warriors</i>

1552
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:17,250
<i>Faced death Battled storms...</i>

1553
01:51:17,333 --> 01:51:18,625
Again.

1554
01:51:18,708 --> 01:51:21,375
<i>Survived, I have</i>

1555
01:51:22,208 --> 01:51:24,375
<i>To the beckon of life</i>

1556
01:51:24,458 --> 01:51:26,375
<i>To make a better life</i>

1557
01:51:26,458 --> 01:51:30,000
<i>Survived, I have</i>

1558
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:34,667
<i>Defamed I was, to build a new name</i>

1559
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:39,000
<i>I had started something
To take it to the end</i>

1560
01:51:39,083 --> 01:51:42,500
<i>Embrace me, life</i>

1561
01:51:43,125 --> 01:51:47,667
<i>Look up, soar high
From ground to sky, oh, my brother...</i>

1562
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:49,167
Go...

1563
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:55,125
<i>Look up, soar high,
From ground to sky, oh, my brother</i>

1564
01:51:55,208 --> 01:51:58,333
<i>Oh, my brother</i>

1565
01:51:58,417 --> 01:52:01,583
<i>They stick to their guns
These brave warriors</i>

1566
01:52:02,458 --> 01:52:06,583
<i>Handsome and charming
Our brave warriors</i>

1567
01:52:06,667 --> 01:52:10,167
<i>They stick to their guns...</i>

1568
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:12,625
- Brother...
- Idiot! Hug me.

1569
01:52:15,667 --> 01:52:16,625
Good job.

1570
01:52:16,958 --> 01:52:18,333
Pass the ball.

1571
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:19,958
- Push it.
- Well done.

1572
01:52:20,125 --> 01:52:21,167
Call the goalie.

1573
01:52:22,958 --> 01:52:24,458
Yoginder, come here.

1574
01:52:26,667 --> 01:52:27,625
Good job.

1575
01:52:29,125 --> 01:52:30,833
Straight!

1576
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,292
Partner, Sandeep.

1577
01:52:48,958 --> 01:52:50,667
I have your jersey safe with me.

1578
01:52:51,208 --> 01:52:52,708
Just waiting to put it on.

1579
01:52:57,833 --> 01:52:59,167
Ready for a drag flick?

1580
01:53:16,292 --> 01:53:21,375
One year of your chairmanship
and I get called back!

1581
01:53:24,375 --> 01:53:26,250
What's going on?

1582
01:53:27,417 --> 01:53:32,917
Sir, you asked me to make a file of
the mistakes made by our team, so...

1583
01:53:34,833 --> 01:53:38,833
The biggest mistake
was that goals weren't scored.

1584
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Sir, Sandeep is back.

1585
01:53:45,458 --> 01:53:49,208
We could consider him
for the Commonwealth Championship.

1586
01:53:50,083 --> 01:53:52,750
He will surely be considered

1587
01:53:53,375 --> 01:53:54,375
but you won't be.

1588
01:53:57,708 --> 01:53:58,875
Harry.

1589
01:54:01,625 --> 01:54:03,458
You will form the team.

1590
01:54:08,833 --> 01:54:09,917
Victory to India!

1591
01:54:10,125 --> 01:54:14,083
<i>Forget, the night long gone</i>

1592
01:54:14,167 --> 01:54:18,000
<i>Start afresh this morning</i>

1593
01:54:18,083 --> 01:54:24,167
<i>Look up, soar high
From ground to sky, oh, my brother</i>

1594
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:29,792
<i>Look up, soar high
From ground to sky, oh, my brother</i>

1595
01:54:29,875 --> 01:54:33,292
<i>Oh, my brother</i>

1596
01:54:33,417 --> 01:54:37,250
<i>They stick to their guns
These brave warriors</i>

1597
01:54:37,375 --> 01:54:41,667
<i>Handsome and charming
Our brave warriors</i>

1598
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:45,667
<i>They stick to their guns
These brave warriors</i>

1599
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:49,792
<i>Handsome and charming
Our brave warriors</i>

1600
01:55:07,375 --> 01:55:10,625
Federation has sent tickets
for the England match.

1601
01:55:12,208 --> 01:55:13,625
Did you hear uncle's plan?

1602
01:55:14,417 --> 01:55:17,000
He's putting up a big screen
on the hockey field.

1603
01:55:17,375 --> 01:55:21,333
He has invited the entire neighborhood.
There will be drums, a DJ and the works.

1604
01:55:25,167 --> 01:55:26,375
Can I get three tickets?

1605
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:28,875
No.

1606
01:55:29,792 --> 01:55:33,917
All of them are yours. You can keep them.
Who do you wish to give them to?

1607
01:55:49,375 --> 01:55:52,083
I didn't want to invite them
without informing you.

1608
01:55:53,167 --> 01:55:56,792
We've been through a lot to get here.

1609
01:55:59,750 --> 01:56:00,917
Just be careful.

1610
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,875
You have a match next week.

1611
01:56:03,708 --> 01:56:07,042
<i>I was so happy to hear
that Sandeep was not only fine</i>

1612
01:56:07,958 --> 01:56:13,667
<i>but was also back on his feet,
running and playing hockey as well.</i>

1613
01:56:14,542 --> 01:56:19,125
<i>International hockey doesn't give
a second chance to any player.</i>

1614
01:56:20,042 --> 01:56:22,458
<i>Sandeep had grabbed this chance,</i>

1615
01:56:23,333 --> 01:56:27,458
<i>and everyone was going to
witness the outcome in the next match.</i>

1616
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:32,458
<i>The match that was going to
take place in my new city, London.</i>

1617
01:56:37,125 --> 01:56:38,417
You look just the same.

1618
01:56:39,917 --> 01:56:40,917
How?

1619
01:56:41,417 --> 01:56:43,083
The way you did when we last met.

1620
01:56:45,625 --> 01:56:47,625
I'm glad you don't look the same.

1621
01:56:52,458 --> 01:56:53,917
I wanted to ask you something.

1622
01:57:00,083 --> 01:57:01,500
How's hockey going for you?

1623
01:57:05,583 --> 01:57:08,000
I thought you'd ask something else.

1624
01:57:08,917 --> 01:57:10,583
I started playing hockey for you.

1625
01:57:11,542 --> 01:57:13,167
I had no other goal in life then

1626
01:57:13,583 --> 01:57:14,708
other than you.

1627
01:57:16,750 --> 01:57:18,042
Then you went away.

1628
01:57:21,542 --> 01:57:25,542
To be honest, I cursed you then...

1629
01:57:28,458 --> 01:57:30,542
but I am here now because of you.

1630
01:57:35,292 --> 01:57:37,042
I called you here to thank you.

1631
01:57:40,917 --> 01:57:42,667
You will come for tomorrow's match?

1632
01:57:46,542 --> 01:57:47,417
I might.

1633
01:57:48,125 --> 01:57:49,667
This is what I was hoping to hear.

1634
01:57:51,750 --> 01:57:52,875
I'll wait for you.

1635
01:58:05,333 --> 01:58:07,792
Tanveer won't witness his defeat
sitting out.

1636
01:58:08,667 --> 01:58:10,292
He will see it on the field.

1637
01:58:10,375 --> 01:58:12,042
Tanveer, you have to break Sandeep.

1638
01:58:12,458 --> 01:58:14,042
Even if we let them score 12 goals,

1639
01:58:14,125 --> 01:58:15,875
the 13th will be ours, sir.

1640
01:58:16,667 --> 01:58:18,292
Thirteen is an evil number,

1641
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,208
and I'm in the mood to kill today.

1642
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:26,083
Go, get them!

1643
01:58:28,417 --> 01:58:33,250
<i>Sandeep returns to international hockey
as a captain after a serious injury.</i>

1644
01:58:33,333 --> 01:58:36,417
<i>I hope this doesn't prove to be another
mistake of the selection committee.</i>

1645
01:58:39,667 --> 01:58:40,583
There's Sandeep.

1646
01:58:41,458 --> 01:58:46,833
There comes the king of Shahbad,
Sandeep Singh!

1647
01:58:46,917 --> 01:58:48,708
A round of applause.

1648
01:58:48,792 --> 01:58:50,167
There's my brave lad.

1649
01:58:50,250 --> 01:58:53,208
<i>And with that, the first half begins.</i>

1650
01:58:56,500 --> 01:59:00,250
<i>Pakistan gets possession,
Yusuf passes the ball to Tanveer.</i>

1651
01:59:00,583 --> 01:59:01,875
Stop it.

1652
01:59:01,958 --> 01:59:03,833
- Go...
- Good...

1653
01:59:03,917 --> 01:59:05,667
<i>And he targets his waist.</i>

1654
01:59:08,250 --> 01:59:09,708
Sandeep, get out of there.

1655
01:59:13,333 --> 01:59:16,542
<i>Tanveer does an east-west dribble,
moves forward and a powerful strike.</i>

1656
01:59:16,625 --> 01:59:19,708
<i>Pakistan scores its first goal
within the first ten minutes of the game.</i>

1657
01:59:19,792 --> 01:59:21,875
Keep the tempo high, guys.

1658
01:59:22,125 --> 01:59:23,250
It's just one goal.

1659
01:59:23,333 --> 01:59:27,125
<i>Sandeep and his team
will have to come up with a new strategy.</i>

1660
01:59:27,208 --> 01:59:28,125
Sandeep.

1661
01:59:28,208 --> 01:59:29,833
Go...

1662
01:59:30,708 --> 01:59:32,250
Good job.

1663
01:59:32,333 --> 01:59:35,208
- Well done!
- Good going!

1664
01:59:35,375 --> 01:59:37,583
Get it.

1665
01:59:39,208 --> 01:59:41,083
Mind your foot.

1666
01:59:43,083 --> 01:59:46,958
<i>And a clever move to turn
a simple pass into a short-corner.</i>

1667
01:59:50,167 --> 01:59:53,000
<i>You can see the determination
on Sandeep's face.</i>

1668
01:59:56,125 --> 01:59:57,625
<i>And that's a fantastic goal!</i>

1669
02:00:01,208 --> 02:00:03,042
<i>A true warrior indeed.</i>

1670
02:00:03,167 --> 02:00:05,583
India one, Pakistan two.

1671
02:00:07,292 --> 02:00:09,792
- It's one-on-one. Careful.
- Go for the shot.

1672
02:00:10,417 --> 02:00:14,083
<i>Pakistan gets another opportunity
for a short-corner.</i>

1673
02:00:14,417 --> 02:00:15,750
- Go...
- Come on, Sunny.

1674
02:00:15,833 --> 02:00:17,042
<i>The atmosphere is tense.</i>

1675
02:00:17,167 --> 02:00:21,083
<i>Tanveer Alam challenging
that he'll hit at the right corner.</i>

1676
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,917
Go...

1677
02:00:25,083 --> 02:00:27,000
<i>And that's a powerful strike.</i>

1678
02:00:28,625 --> 02:00:30,958
<i>Tanveer Alam stuck to his promise</i>

1679
02:00:31,042 --> 02:00:33,458
<i>adding up to India's worries.</i>

1680
02:00:34,083 --> 02:00:35,417
<i>Don't mess with us.</i>

1681
02:00:35,708 --> 02:00:36,875
It's bitter...

1682
02:00:38,792 --> 02:00:40,542
but it's true, Mr. Chairman.

1683
02:00:40,625 --> 02:00:42,958
Preeto, aren't you going for the match?

1684
02:00:43,208 --> 02:00:46,208
<i>Pakistan's attack
is at its peak at the finals.</i>

1685
02:00:48,125 --> 02:00:51,042
Long live Pakistan!

1686
02:00:51,208 --> 02:00:52,500
Come on.

1687
02:00:54,542 --> 02:00:57,417
<i>Sandeep Singh plays aggressive hockey.</i>

1688
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:00,708
<i>Sandeep passes,
and Raghuveer scores a goal!</i>

1689
02:01:03,958 --> 02:01:06,250
My child is back in his form.

1690
02:01:06,417 --> 02:01:08,042
No one can stop him now.

1691
02:01:08,250 --> 02:01:09,375
You saw that?

1692
02:01:10,708 --> 02:01:11,667
Amazing!

1693
02:01:12,583 --> 02:01:14,667
He is over-acting. He's pretending.

1694
02:01:16,083 --> 02:01:18,083
I'll come there and beat you up.

1695
02:01:19,708 --> 02:01:20,583
Shut up.

1696
02:01:21,833 --> 02:01:26,250
<i>Let's see whether Sandeep Singh can
convert this short-corner into a goal.</i>

1697
02:01:33,042 --> 02:01:35,958
<i>That was an amazing 360-degree
dodge by Sandeep Singh!</i>

1698
02:01:36,042 --> 02:01:39,000
- Yes!
- <i>That was an awesome goal.</i>

1699
02:01:41,208 --> 02:01:43,542
<i>Five minutes left on the ticker.</i>

1700
02:01:43,625 --> 02:01:47,083
<i>And Sandeep Singh scoring this goal
at the eleventh hour is amazing.</i>

1701
02:01:47,167 --> 02:01:48,125
<i>Well played!</i>

1702
02:01:48,208 --> 02:01:49,750
<i>Both the teams have the same score.</i>

1703
02:01:50,958 --> 02:01:54,792
Keep your ego aside
and clap for him, Sharma.

1704
02:01:55,083 --> 02:01:56,792
That boy is playing for India.

1705
02:01:59,792 --> 02:02:01,833
Strike a goal, Tanveer.

1706
02:02:02,875 --> 02:02:05,167
<i>He dodges the goalkeeper
and tries to score a goal.</i>

1707
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:07,625
<i>That's a great sliding defense by Sandeep.</i>

1708
02:02:08,833 --> 02:02:09,958
Pass it.

1709
02:02:12,917 --> 02:02:13,792
Gagan!

1710
02:02:13,917 --> 02:02:15,167
Navjyot, come on.

1711
02:02:15,292 --> 02:02:16,458
Wait...

1712
02:02:19,042 --> 02:02:20,458
<i>Well done Sandeep Singh.</i>

1713
02:02:20,542 --> 02:02:23,083
<i>Instead of the mid-fielder,
he chose the center forward</i>

1714
02:02:23,167 --> 02:02:25,542
<i>and earned a critical
short-corner for India.</i>

1715
02:02:40,083 --> 02:02:41,917
<i>You're coming for tomorrow's match?</i>

1716
02:02:42,458 --> 02:02:43,542
<i>I'll wait for you.</i>

1717
02:02:46,583 --> 02:02:49,292
Sandeep...

1718
02:02:55,917 --> 02:02:58,000
<i>This is a great opportunity
for Sandeep Singh</i>

1719
02:02:58,083 --> 02:03:02,208
<i>to prove himself as a player,
a drag flicker and as a captain.</i>

1720
02:03:02,292 --> 02:03:04,167
Sandeep, we have to
convert this one in a goal.

1721
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:06,333
Sandeep, you must make India win.

1722
02:03:06,417 --> 02:03:08,708
We must take the cup with us.

1723
02:03:08,792 --> 02:03:12,833
Sandeep...

1724
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,250
<i>- Don't see my matches.
- I won't.</i>

1725
02:03:42,042 --> 02:03:44,000
<i>Oh, no, he slips</i>

1726
02:03:44,083 --> 02:03:45,583
<i>and missed the target.</i>

1727
02:03:45,667 --> 02:03:48,417
<i>Losing your body balance
at such an important moment...</i>

1728
02:03:48,583 --> 02:03:52,458
<i>losing your focus could be dangerous.
We'll soon find out.</i>

1729
02:03:52,583 --> 02:03:54,583
<i>The Indian team is celebrating</i>

1730
02:03:54,667 --> 02:03:57,833
<i>whereas Pakistan's team
has applied for a review.</i>

1731
02:03:58,208 --> 02:03:59,917
<i>India and Pakistan.</i>

1732
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,958
<i>Both the countries are
waiting for the result with bated breaths.</i>

1733
02:04:03,042 --> 02:04:05,083
Don't worry, the ball went out.
We have won.

1734
02:04:08,333 --> 02:04:12,208
<i>I think Sandeep Singh missed the target.</i>

1735
02:04:17,875 --> 02:04:19,833
<i>It felt like someone fired a bullet.</i>

1736
02:04:26,875 --> 02:04:29,333
<i>That was a fantastic strike,
tearing the net apart!</i>

1737
02:04:29,417 --> 02:04:31,125
<i>That's a historic win for India.</i>

1738
02:04:31,208 --> 02:04:34,875
<i>Sandeep Singh creates
a record with this goal.</i>

1739
02:04:37,667 --> 02:04:41,042
<i>Forget, the night long gone</i>

1740
02:04:42,167 --> 02:04:43,958
That was an awesome flick, Brother!

1741
02:04:44,042 --> 02:04:46,417
You tore the net. Well done!

1742
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:50,833
<i>Look up, soar high
