They would name him Prithvi
in honor of his twin brother.

208
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:21,365
A hard worker and a believer
in the new democratic India,

209
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:24,134
Bharat and his brother became successful with a popular restaurant.

210

survive was through extensive

But in no way could
he carry the hospital's bill.

217
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,059
So he had no choice

218

[Daniel] As a result,

Prithvi died in
front of his eyes.

227
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:16,319
In a fit of rage, he went around
to the eldest brother's house,

228
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:18,822
stabbed him through
the heart with a steak knife.

229
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:21,124
Which means he got his
property back,

230

who knew Delhi's
people and places.

a hard-on for weaponry,

375
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:33,989
So, tell you what, um,
I'll give you

376
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:35,624
twenty lacs now,
and you come back

377
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:37,025

Fifty lac on delivery.

380
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:44,500

bringing all this over here.

Today it's forty.

387
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:01,116

395
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:17,533

I have small children.

397
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:22,471
Alright. I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

398
00:57:22,473 --> 00:57:24,807
I'm going to have
my man Arvind here

399
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:26,475

to give to your boss man.

402
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:31,580
No, it's going to be gorgeous,

403
00:57:31,582 --> 00:57:33,615
you wouldn't believe

405
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,153
Astonishes me.
I'm telling him all the time,

406
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:39,755
"You talk too much."

407
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:41,657
That's what I'll do.

408
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:42,891
So just leave the merch here,

409
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:44,660
we'll test it overnight.

410
00:57:44,662 --> 00:57:46,161
You come back tomorrow.

411
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:48,497
And I'll give you
the other fifteen.

412
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:50,599

Wasn't he supposed to get
some big, fuck off spoilers

422
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:28,136
so he could fly
or something like that?

423
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,740
What's he going to pay for
this-- Nice interior!

424
