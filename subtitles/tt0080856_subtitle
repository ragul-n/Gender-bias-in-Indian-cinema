00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,181
They are too small to talk

Only one Only one

26
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,189

36
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,161

Now you listen...

43
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,860
How we became like this

44
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,197
We had neither food nor shelter

45
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,807
How we became like this

46
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,812
We had neither food nor shelter

47
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,822
The king of ghosts favoured us

48
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,153
The king of ghosts favoured us

49
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,818
The king of ghosts favoured us

50
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,828
He gave us three boons

51
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,990
Three boons, three boons,
three boons

52
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,830
Those boons changed our fate

53
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,836
Those boons changed our fate

54
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,845
Those boons are the cause
of our prosperity

55
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,848
Those boons are the cause
of our prosperity

56
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,350
Because of those boons...

57
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,185
We two are the king's son-in-law

58
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:56,190
We two are the king's son-in-law

59
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,790
Gupinath...

60
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,794
Yes... tell me...

61
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:11,804
We have spend ten long years
in fun and leisure.

62
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,807
I'm not liking it anymore.

63
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:21,807
You are right... we
must do something...

64
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:25,144
Age doesn't stop for anyone...
it keeps on increasing...

65
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,820
Yes, I've also heard
people saying that...

66
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:34,824
A sapling today is a
huge tree tomorrow...

67
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,832
A small fish today is
a huge one tomorrow...

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,835
Those who crawl today
becomes old tomorrow...

69
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,341
The hands which holds lollypop
today...

70
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,002
will have a walking stick tomorrow.

71
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,842
Today those who have bouncy hair,
will have none tomorrow...

72
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,347
Why?

73
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,782
Because their hair have fallen
and they have become bald...

74
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:06,791
Whatever is left turns grey...
teeth starts disappearing...

75
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,793
won't be able to eat meet then.

76
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:16,129
Bagha, as you grow old cataract
starts developing...

77
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,133
I know that. Do you
understand Gupinath.

78
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,798
This is not the time for leisure.

79
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:26,809
Wasting time this way
is very painful...

80
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:32,815
No, no, no, no...

81
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,819
no more wasting time.

82
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:40,826
No more wasting time,
no more wasting time

83
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:47,992
The blood in our veins is still
hot, our bones are still...

84
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,833
strong, we can still work hard

85
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:58,843
The blood in our veins is still
hot, our bones are still...

86
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,778
strong, we can still work hard

87
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,783
We still have time

88
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,785
We still have time

89
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:12,792
No more wasting time,
no more wasting time

90
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,800
There is so much to
see in this world

91
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,800
There is so much to know and learn

92
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,964
So much is left, we
don't know anything

93
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,802
There is so much to
see in this world

94
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,809
There is so much to know and learn

95
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,811
Why are we sitting idle at home

96
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,815
Why are we sitting idle at home

97
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,817
This is not bearable anymore

98
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:39,977
This is not bearable anymore

99
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,144
Unbearable

100
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,812
We still have time

101
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,823
We still have time

102
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,827
No more wasting time, no more
wasting time, no more...

103
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,829
wasting time

104
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,836
Let's go out for a trip

105
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,770
Let's go...

106
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:08,109
Let's go out and travel
to our heart's content

107
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:17,780
In the forests, in the mountains
and in the deserts

108
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:22,123
In the forests, in the mountains
and in the deserts

109
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,798
Do we have the shoes?
- Shoes...?

110
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,800
The magic shoes!

111
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,798
Yes... yes... we have...
we have it here only...

112
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,315
Bagha...

113
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,827
Look at this.

114
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,162
What are this... cobwebs...
or mistake of my eyes?

115
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,835
If the shoes don't work
in this condition?

116
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,839
If the boons don't work
after this 10 years?

117
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,169
Let's do one thing...
- What...

118
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,833
We'll go to the terrace
and come back...

119
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,341
You are right...

120
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,844
To the terrace...

121
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,855
Let's ask for clothes now...

122
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,860
What clothes...
- What clothes... well...

123
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,190
clothes of a showman...

124
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,853
Clothes of a showman...
- Clothes of a showman...

125
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:40,872
We are invited to the
anniversary of Hirak...

126
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,032
When...

127
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,042
15th September... a messenger
has just come...

128
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,202
Very good news!

129
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,369
We are not invited...

130
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,209
No... no... you two only will go...
of course you are invited...

131
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,873
Your favour...

132
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,884
We are eager to see new countries...

133
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:56,046
Well... of course you'll see new
countries. I'm growing old.

134
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,885
It's my time to rest and relax.
Moreover I don't...

135
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,982
want to go when you
two are willing.

136
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,152
You are so kind!

137
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,822
Hirak... what a beautiful name!

138
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,990
Because it has diamond mines...
hence the name is Hirak...

139
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,158
Diamond mines?

140
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,326
Yes...

141
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,835
The king must be very rich...

142
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:16,341
Yes. The king of Hirak has a
desire to listen to your music.

143
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:20,003
If you sing a song there.
I know everybody...

144
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,842
will praise you a lot.

145
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,850
I want you two to go.

146
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,349
Promise me that you'll go.

147
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,853
No... no... there is no
reason for not going...

148
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,354
This kind of opportunity
doesn't come everyday...

149
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,015
So the function is
on 15th September...

150
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,353
Yes... 15th September...

151
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,018
So we have some time...

152
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,857
One month more...

153
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,362
We have a desire.

154
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,196
We want to go for a trip...

155
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,869
Do you want to go for a pilgrimage
to Haridwar or Benaras?

156
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,032
Going for a pilgrimage might
take longer time...

157
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,202
Then?

158
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,870
We want to go somewhere near by...

159
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,881
We haven't been anywhere
since long...

160
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,880
Right... that's true...

161
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,144
People might think
that we are idle...

162
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,812
All these 10 years...

163
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,822
We are only going around from
this room to that room...

164
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,824
Right... that's true...

165
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,325
I hope there won't be any problem...

166
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,827
If you please permit us...

167
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,831
That's fine... you can go...
but who'll go with you?

168
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,333
Well...

169
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,165
Who'll go with you?

170
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:24,840
I'll go with him and
he'll go with me...

171
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,317
What is this?

172
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,981
Diamond necklace, your majesty...
you had ordered for them...

173
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,148
Good... good...

174
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,829
All the ministers, come
to me one by one.

175
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,835
I'm satisfied with your work.
Come, come everybody.

176
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:29,170
Don't be shy...

177
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,849
Come, defence minister...

178
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,857
minister of industries...

179
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,863
education minister...

180
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,866
information minister...

181
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,305
Hey court jester...

182
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,805
you also like diamond necklace.

183
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:05,969
Do you want one?

184
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,307
Is there anything left for me?

185
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,815
Of course there is one
for you...

186
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,150
well...

187
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,817
where is the scientist?

188
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,826
He is in the laboratory,
your majesty...

189
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,828
Why? What made him so busy?

190
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,834
I called him, but still he didn't
come... how dare he...

191
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:31,995
call him...

192
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,164
Ask him to come immediately
or I won't spare him...

193
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,004
he has come from Sambuddhi
and wasting food...

194
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,843
...and money for the
last 7 months...

195
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,848
he said that he is the greatest
scientist of this earth...

196
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,852
he also said that there is no such
thing which is unknown to him.

197
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,851
. he said he wants a laboratory...

198
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,856
...god knows what he
is going to invent...

199
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,858
which will make the work
of ruling easier...

200
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,191
I thought to give him a chance...

201
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:01,791
if he keeps his promise the
country will be benefited...

202
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,800
From then on he is here...

203
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,805
god knows what he does day and
night in his laboratory...

204
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,811
Gold, silver, iron, bronze, lead,
frog, snake, vultures leg...

205
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,813
everything is there
in that laboratory...

206
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,814
He makes paste of metals
in mortar and pestle...

207
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,977
god knows what he burns in the
oven all day and night...

208
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:25,820
All that is a mystery... he
has taken 7 lakhs of coins...

209
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:31,830
but no result... that day he
was asking for diamond...

210
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,991
He wanted 2000 carat diamond.
. but I didn't give him...

211
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:39,003
I didn't... god knows what
is there in his mind...

212
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,006
And when I rebuke him he says...

213
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,840
have patience o king, there
is little work left...

214
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,845
I can't wait any longer...

215
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:51,178
I am losing my patience... today
I need to see some result...

216
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,849
let's talk of work now...

217
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,855
Your majesty, there are
three visitors for you...

218
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,790
Three people indeed...

219
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,793
Who are they... what do they want?

220
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:07,798
One is a farmer... one is a day
labour... one is a singer...

221
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,801
How do they dare to come to
me... what do they want...

222
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,804
They say they have some complaints...

223
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,806
Who... the farmer?

224
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:18,968
The day labour too...

225
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,306
How dare they...

226
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,813
They'll suffer...

227
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,816
And what about the singer?

228
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,818
The soldiers brought him here...

229
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:28,978
Why?

230
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,817
He dared to make some mistake...

231
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,823
Let them wait... I'll
see to it later...

232
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,826
tell me finance minister...

233
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,827
Your majesty...

234
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,832
What is the news of the revenues?

235
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,834
Your majesty, we have collected
half of the revenues...

236
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:48,838
What are you saying...
still half left...

237
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,841
what a state of lawlessness!

238
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,171
Escapists...

239
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,846
The soldiers are collecting the
rest of the revenues your majesty.

240
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,849
. people are not willing
to pay happily...

241
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,943
I know collecting revenue this
way is not fair but we need...

242
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,785
...money for the anniversary
function.

243
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,119
Who said it's not fair...

244
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,783
Your majesty.

245
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,796
It's unfair when people doesn't
want to pay the revenues...

246
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,956
they won't be harmed if they...

247
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,124
...pay revenues on time...

248
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,134
otherwise applying force
is the only way... right?

249
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,794
Right... right...

250
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,302
Right?

251
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,808
Right... right... right... right...

252
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,807
Listen, minister of industries...

253
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,814
...we want huge amount of diamond.

254
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,144
...we have to gift them
to the invitees...

255
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,979
The workers are digging for the
diamonds in the mines, your majesty.

256
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,976
What is the number of
soldiers in the mines?

257
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,818
300, your majesty...

258
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,824
they are guarding the working
day and night...

259
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,825
It's important to keep an eye
on each and every worker...

260
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,987
it's hard to trust them...

261
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,997
If any one neglects work...

262
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,157
Whip...

263
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,167
Yes, whipping is the
only medicine...

264
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,829
the workers are skilled
in stealing diamonds...

265
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,840
They steal whenever they
get chance... right?

266
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,843
Right... right... right...

267
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,273
Right?

268
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,779
Right... right...

269
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,783
Listen, defence minister...

270
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,113
Yes your majesty...

271
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:12,783
Tell the soldiers to wipe out
all the signs of poverty from...

272
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,794
...the side of the high way.

273
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,796
They will definitely do
that, your majesty...

274
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:23,801
the soldiers will wipe out
anything that looks bad...

275
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:30,807
Well... I don't want any guest
to suspect anything...

276
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,814
Right... right...

277
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,143
Right... right... right...

278
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,817
Information minister...

279
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,149
Yes, your majesty...

280
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:44,981
Let me ask you now...

281
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,149
Your majesty nothing to worry...

282
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,817
messengers have been sent
to different countries...

283
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:51,829
Rest of the arrangements are
nearly done... huge gates...

284
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,832
crackers... coloured lanterns.
. 500 new flags...

285
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,834
A huge statue of yours...

286
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:57,994
Well... well...

287
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,095
Your majesty, the statue
will be a huge one...

288
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,764
a full length statue of yours...

289
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,105
Of course, your majesty...
nothing to worry about...

290
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,779
I want people to see this statue
and understand how much...

291
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,781
...strength the king of Hirak posses.

292
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,778
And I want this statue to be
inaugurated in an auspicious moment.

293
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,786
. court astrologer...

294
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,116
Yes, your majesty...

295
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,781
Is that a calendar?

296
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,789
I always keep it with me...

297
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,793
to inform you about
good and bad times...

298
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,792
So tell me what the calendar says...

299
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,791
About what?

300
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,967
15th September is the anniversary
of our country...

301
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,803
is that a auspicious day
to inaugurate the statue?

302
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,808
Whose statue, your majesty?

303
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,968
What... what were you doing...
we were discussing so much...

304
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,310
and you don't even
know whose statue?

305
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,973
Critical calculations,
your majesty...

306
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,144
so I don't get to hear
any other words...

307
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,312
your majesty, it's important to...

308
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,821
...know whose statue...

309
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,824
The statue is mine... hurry up...
find a auspicious moment...

310
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:59,828
Your majesty, if it's your statue
then there is an auspicious moment.

311
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,832
. middle of the night
is a good time...

312
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:05,995
Middle of the night?

313
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,834
No problem according to astrology...

314
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,169
Problem is mine...

315
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,005
people will see darkness
instead of my statue...

316
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,847
Nothing is a problem to
the king of Hirak...

317
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:20,851
the night will become day...
it's not that problem...

318
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,854
Auspicious time will happen
according to the king's will...

319
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,856
who cares what the calendar says...

320
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,188
Okay then... listen every body...

321
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,858
the statue will be inaugurated
in the midday... right?

322
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,864
Right... right...

323
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,866
Right... right...

324
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,030
And from the day of the function,
the year of Hirak will commence.

325
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,871
Do you understand,
court astrologer...

326
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,036
The year of Hirak will commence
from the day of the function...

327
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,205
As you say, your majesty...
you are the lord...

328
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,881
No need to follow any other
calculations... wipe them all...

329
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,383
No harm in that...

330
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,217
Do I have to wipe out
any planet or star?

331
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,881
Shut up and do your work...

332
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,820
Yes, your majesty...

333
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:05,988
Education minister...

334
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,156
Your majesty...

335
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,834
The school should be shut
down from today...

336
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:11,994
Schools?

337
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,836
Are you deaf? The school should
be shut down from today...

338
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,341
As you say, your majesty...

339
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,843
What's the name of the teacher?

340
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,848
Udayan, your majesty...

341
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,180
Well... tell him that
he has taught enough...

342
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:36,860
the more they study and learn
the more they become rebel...

343
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,361
Right?

344
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,865
Right... right... right...

345
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:45,869
And what ever books are there in
the country... burn them all...

346
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,869
Certainly, your majesty...

347
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:56,870
And whatever mythological books
are there... - All rubbish...

348
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,882
Destroy them too...
- There is no harm in it...

349
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:09,826
Come, scientist... come...

350
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:25,843
What greetings... are those flowers
for me? This bouquet?

351
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,846
Please smell them, your majesty...

352
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,850
But they are made of paper...

353
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:38,857
No doubt about it... all
beautiful flowers...

354
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,861
Oh, they smell great...

355
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,863
The fragrance will remain
for 6 months...

356
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:51,870
the flowers will remain
fresh as well...

357
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,371
What are you saying?

358
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,374
They remain fresh for long...

359
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,807
Wonderful... wonderful...

360
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,813
They will remain fresh for
6 months, your majesty...

361
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:09,151
Well... you are so intelligent...

362
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,820
in seven and half months you have
taken seven lakh coins...

363
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,825
And now you are producing
these paper flowers...

364
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,829
Wrong... this is nothing...
this is negligible...

365
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,330
Then tell me what is
the real invention...

366
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,832
Don't remain mute...

367
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,832
Brain washer...

368
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,995
Stupid!

369
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,163
What?

370
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,831
Brain washer...

371
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,169
What is that?

372
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:34,838
That's a machine... brain
washing machine...

373
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,005
Brain washing?

374
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,343
Exactly!

375
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,856
Describe clearly...

376
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,863
This is such a machine which
makes ruling very easy...

377
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,865
those subject will rebel against
the king, this machine...

378
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,961
...will change him into
a obedient subject...

379
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,801
it won't be a tough work...

380
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,133
What are you saying?

381
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,800
This is what I was working on...

382
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,829
This is unbelievable!

383
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,832
This machine will engrave words
in human beings brain...

384
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,992
Words?

385
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,160
Yes, words...

386
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,828
What words? I should
know that words...

387
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,839
What ever you want...

388
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:39,841
Wonderful... how long does it work?

389
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,845
Till death, your majesty...

390
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:47,007
it wipes all sorts of rebellion
thoughts from people's brain...

391
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,849
If this really happens scientist,
then you are great...

392
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:54,856
I'm nothing... you are the
king... you are great...

393
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,188
Court poet...

394
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,020
Yes, your majesty...

395
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,794
You are a natural poet, right?

396
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,803
Well I don't want to say it myself...

397
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,806
You have to write some poems.
The king's...

398
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,808
one for farmers...

399
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,139
one for workers...

400
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,810
And one for the teacher...

401
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,317
those who are waiting
outside can come in...

402
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:28,825
Scientist, you like diamonds,
don't you?

403
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,828
Diamonds are alluring...

404
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:36,832
If your machine works, then
you can take this...

405
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,335
Of course it will work,
your majesty...

406
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:39,836
please check it yourself...

407
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,840
You can go back to your
laboratory now...

408
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,346
Come nearer...

409
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,013
what's your name?

410
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,181
Fazal Mian, your majesty...

411
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,781
What do you want?

412
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:05,119
Your majesty, I only have
2 acres of land...

413
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,791
I use them for farming... last
year there was famine...

414
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:13,804
Harvest was not good... I
have wife and children...

415
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,807
I can't even feed them properly...

416
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,139
Moreover I have to pay the interest
of the money lender...

417
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,804
I will die if I have to pay
the revenue, o king...

418
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:29,149
Your majesty you are both father
and mother of the poor...

419
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,815
we'll starve and die if I
have to pay the revenue...

420
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,829
Court poet...
- Yes, your majesty...

421
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,159
Have you finished writing...

422
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,823
Yes, your majesty...

423
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,834
Then you do your work... Fazal Mian,
listen to it carefully

424
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,841
Keeping revenues due is
not a good thing to do...

425
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:56,845
Very good... keeping revenues due
is not a good thing to do...

426
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,347
have you heard that... now say it...

427
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,783
Well it's not my intention
to keep revenues due...

428
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:07,118
your majesty, I'll pay
all your dues...

429
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:12,789
...but I'll starve and die
if I have to pay revenues...

430
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,795
Tell him the rest of the poem...

431
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,799
Even if one doesn't have food, one
should always pay the king...

432
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,131
...his revenues.

433
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,296
Wonderful...

434
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,806
even if one doesn't have food, one
should always pay the king...

435
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,136
...his revenues.

436
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:33,811
Even if we die, the king
of Hirak is god...

437
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:36,820
Take him to the laboratory...

438
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,827
O king... have mercy...

439
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,832
Come nearer...

440
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,104
What's your name?

441
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,770
Balaram, your majesty...

442
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,779
Tell me Balaram... what
do you have to say...

443
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,784
I work in the mine...
it's a tough job...

444
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,946
I can't work for long... my
body aches, your majesty...

445
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,284
Don't you get your wages?

446
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,949
That doesn't fill my stomach,
your majesty...

447
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,788
moreover the soldiers
whip us badly...

448
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,794
that's unbearable, o king...

449
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,796
Who says that?

450
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,124
What...

451
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,794
Those who say that whipping of
soldiers is unbearable are wrong.

452
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,803
. now listen what the king
says... read out...

453
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,968
Those who work in the mines...

454
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,807
...even the god of
death is afraid of them.

455
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,810
Those who work in the mines, even
the god of death...

456
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,314
...is afraid of them... say that...

457
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,817
What is this, your majesty?
This is not true...

458
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,819
workers of diamond mine
don't have a long life...

459
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,151
The air is poisonous
inside the mine...

460
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,153
Read out...

461
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,986
There is no repentance even we
are empty stomach, eating...

462
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,825
...stomach full makes people fat.

463
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,330
There is no repentance even we
are empty stomach, eating...

464
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,832
...stomach full makes people fat.

465
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,162
This is not true, your majesty...
this is not true...

466
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,829
Shut up... listen to him...

467
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,773
Take him to the laboratory...

468
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,295
Come nearer...

469
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,800
What's your name?

470
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,809
Charandas, your majesty.
. I am a singer...

471
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,810
the soldiers came and
told me don't sing...

472
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,816
So I thought that I'll come to
you and tell you... don't sing.

473
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,820
. what kind of order is this?

474
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:53,824
Life ends as music ends...

475
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,827
I am singing since the day
I gained my senses...

476
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,828
Let me hear your music...

477
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,329
Shall I sing?

478
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,991
Sing... no body is stopping you...

479
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,830
Start singing...

480
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,847
This world is full of wonders

481
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,009
O my friend

482
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:23,178
This world is full of wonders

483
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,856
In which ever direction I look at

484
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,858
I become astonished

485
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,190
In which ever direction I look at

486
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,855
I become astonished

487
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:36,867
I don't find any
meaning for things

488
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:40,029
O my friend I don't find
any meaning for things

489
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,868
O my friend

490
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:46,877
my friend this world
is full of wonders

491
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,876
Great music!

492
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,208
What beautiful lyrics!

493
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:55,878
Look good people are
living in a broken hut

494
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:01,822
Look good people are
living in a broken hut

495
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:05,827
And bad people is sitting
on a throne

496
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:09,833
Look good people are
living in a broken hut

497
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:13,834
And bad people is sitting
on a throne

498
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:18,840
Those who harvest golden crops,
don't have food for themselves

499
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:26,850
Those who harvest golden crops,
don't have food for themselves

500
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:30,854
The workers of diamond mine don't
have a single penny for themselves

501
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:34,858
The workers of diamond mine don't
have a single penny for themselves

502
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,860
O my friend the workers of diamond
mine don't have a single...

503
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,190
...penny for themselves

504
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,858
O my friend

505
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,868
This world is full of wonders

506
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,030
O my friend

507
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,870
This world is full of wonders

508
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,376
Stop singing...

509
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,039
tie his mouth...

510
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,207
tie his hands...

511
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,375
take him to the forest...

512
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,145
Dig a hole in the ground
and leave him there...

513
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,811
That's not a big deal...

514
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,829
Then Sanjibak thought...

515
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,832
if the king himself turns enemy
to his subjects then it's an...

516
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,834
...alarming situation.

517
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:24,842
People fear the thunder but the
anger of the king is more dangerous.

518
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:28,845
Thunder strikes a
particular place...

519
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:33,850
but the king's anger destroys
the lives of so many people...

520
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:48,865
So Sanjibak thought if the subjects
have to die then instead...

521
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:53,029
...of obliging the king.

522
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,818
Sit... sit...

523
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:17,826
What are you all learning
today... what lesson...

524
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,330
well teacher...

525
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,832
Hitopodesh...

526
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,834
Hitopodesh...

527
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,838
that means beneficial advice...

528
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:35,845
who judges what is beneficial.
. who gives the advice...

529
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,850
You don't know the name, right?

530
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,853
His words has no values
who has no name...

531
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:50,860
Do you know who judges what is
beneficial... king of Hirak...

532
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,863
listen to the kings apophthegm...

533
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:59,869
He who learns dies of hunger...

534
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:06,808
Say everybody... he who
learns dies of hunger...

535
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:10,812
teacher you also say...

536
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,147
what happened... say
everybody... say.

537
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:23,820
He who learns dies of hunger...
say all of you...

538
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:28,829
He who learns dies of hunger...

539
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,332
Continue...

540
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:35,839
There is no limit of knowledge
so it's useless to know...

541
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:43,846
There is no limit of knowledge
so it's useless to know... say...

542
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:48,852
There is no limit of knowledge
so it's useless to know...

543
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,856
Learning brings loss, it neither
brings fame nor money...

544
00:34:56,027 --> 00:35:00,794
Learning brings loss, it neither
brings fame nor money...

545
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:06,803
Learning brings loss, it neither
brings fame nor money...

546
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:11,806
King of Hirak is wise, everybody
sing praises for him...

547
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:19,816
King of Hirak is wise, everybody
sing praises for him...

548
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:23,820
King of Hirak is wise, everybody
sing praises for him...

549
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,823
Go... from today you'll
have holidays...

550
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,827
no more school from today onwards...

551
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,843
You haven't forgotten what
I've taught you all...

552
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,346
...till today, have you?

553
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,180
Sugata?

554
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,845

Bhanu?

556
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,785
No, teacher...

Alam?

558
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,785
No, teacher...

559
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,292
Soudas?

560
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,796
I haven't, forgotten, teacher...

561
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,788
Pratip?

562
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,128
No, teacher...

563
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,792
Mihir?

564
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,132
I haven't, forgotten, teacher...

565
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,796
Karim?

566
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,136
No, teacher...

567
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,138
Prabir?

568
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,803
No, teacher...

569
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,811
Ali?

570
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,141
No, teacher...

571
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,316
Kanu?

572
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,818
No, teacher...

573
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,319
Rashid?

574
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,821
No, teacher...

575
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,323
Nimai?

576
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,825
No, teacher...

577
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:53,841
You all have heard that school
is closed from today onwards...

578
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,117
you all play... don't harm anyone...

579
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,777
Keep faith on yourself...

580
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:07,119
...and remember that
the school will open someday...

581
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:09,951
Kanu...

582
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,791
go...

583
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,127
go home now...

584
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:32,814
Even if we die, the king
of Hirak is god...

585
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:36,979
Even if we die, the king
of Hirak is god...

586
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,316
What are you saying, Fazal Mian?

587
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,823
The king of Hirak is god...

588
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,825
What rubbish are you talking?

589
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:47,830
Who says rubbish... Fazal Mian
doesn't talk rubbish...

590
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:51,834
Even if we die, the king
of Hirak is god...

591
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,995
Even if we die, the king
of Hirak is god...

592
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,333
Those who work in the mines...

593
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,839
...even the god of
death is afraid of them.

594
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,340
There is no repentance even we
are empty stomach, eating...

595
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,842
...stomach full makes people fat.

596
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:07,784
The workers are great, the
king of Hirak is a god.

597
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:11,788
The workers are great, the
king of Hirak is a god.

598
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,150
Father...

599
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:53,831
What a disaster, son...
we have nothing left...

600
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:57,163
Go away from this place, son...
don't stay here...

601
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,099
go away...

602
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,263
it's a cursed country...

603
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,937
Are you all mad?

604
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,277
Beware... don't try to
stop the king's army...

605
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,112
otherwise we'll do your
brain washing...

606
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:30,127
Soldiers, catch him... don't
let him go... catch him...

607
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,838
The sky and the air
is full of happiness

608
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:17,847
The sky and the air
is full of happiness

609
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,354
The sky and the air
is full of happiness

610
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:38,859
The birds sing on the trees,
it's so beautiful all around

611
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:50,881
The birds sing on the trees,
it's so beautiful all around

612
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:55,214
The sky and the air
is full of happiness

613
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:09,832
We are very happy today

614
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:17,838
We are very happy today

615
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,003
We have come out of the captivity
of our house...

616
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,843
...and we have become free

617
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:28,007
We have come out of the captivity
of our house...

618
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,849
...and we have become free

619
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,856
We have become free

620
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,366
Today again we have
become wanderers

621
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,871
We'll go far from our country

622
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,877
Again we have become wanderers

623
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,379
We'll go far from our country

624
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:00,815
We will fill the world with music

625
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:06,145
We will fill the world with music

626
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:11,320
It reminds is of the old days

627
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:16,833
It reminds is of the old days

628
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,834
Old memories...

629
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,835
...come back to us

630
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:27,834
The sky and the air
is full of happiness

631
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:34,852
The birds sing on the trees,
it's so beautiful all around

632
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:38,855
The sky and the air
is full of happiness

633
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:04,812
Look at the mighty sea

634
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:16,825
Look at the mighty sea

635
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:28,838
The waves come running one
after another, look at that

636
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:37,846
Look at the mighty sea

637
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:50,861
Look, the sky and the water
meeting in the horizon

638
00:43:54,932 --> 00:44:00,802
Look, the sky and the water
meeting in the horizon

639
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:06,807
What a beauty... what beauty...
what beauty

640
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:15,808
Look at the mighty sea

641
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,842
Now the scene is different

642
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,850
Now the scene is different

643
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:51,854
It is wild, it's a forest

644
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:54,857
Now the scene is different

645
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:58,861
It is wild, it's a forest

646
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:08,804
Here it's dark in the day

647
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:15,811
Here it's dark in the day

648
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,816
Here it's silence everywhere

649
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,821
Here it's silence everywhere

650
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:31,827
Holding their heads
high towards the sky

651
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:38,834
Holding their heads
high towards the sky

652
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:43,837
The huge ancient
trees are sleeping

653
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,842
The huge ancient
trees are sleeping

654
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:08,797
Now look at those mountains

655
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:14,804
Their peaks are covered with snow

656
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:21,811
They are still, they are grave

657
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:34,982
They are worshiped by many yogis...

658
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:44,160
...many sages and many noble souls

659
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:54,839
They are wonders, they are
turbulent, they are the...

660
00:46:54,912 --> 00:47:03,786
...Himalayas, the Himalayas,
the Himalayas.

661
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:25,808
Do you want to go back
to our country now?

662
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:30,813
There are still few days left.
. why so hurry...

663
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,815
we have just regained our freedom...

664
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:35,808
Aren't you full yet?

665
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:40,813
Very tasty food... I want
to eat a little more...

666
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:47,159
You eat... let me go find some
water to wash hands...

667
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,160
Bagha...

668
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:11,279
What are you looking at, Bagha?

669
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,789
If you take one step ahead you
will die... I'll kill you...

670
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:23,291
Why will you kill us... we
haven't done anything...

671
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,793
We are good human beings...

672
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,794
Who are you?

673
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,796
We are the people of Shundi...

674
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,302
Who are you?

675
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:39,808
Shundi is far away from here...
how did you come...

676
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:42,970
Why are you here?

677
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:44,308
Don't you have a home?

678
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:48,817
What is the proof that
you are from Shundi?

679
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:50,147
What is the proof that
you are not a robber?

680
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,312
Why are you hiding here?

681
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:52,821
Why are you carrying a weapon?

682
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,152
We are not carrying any weapon...

683
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:56,317
Yes...

684
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,159
You don't look like bad people...

685
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,003
Do you know where have you come?

686
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,172
We don't know that...

687
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:19,340
We are travellers...

688
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:20,849
Yes... yes...

689
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,850
Look at that hill...

690
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,854
Hirak is beyond that...

691
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,357
Hirak?

692
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:32,861
Does it have diamond mines?

693
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,864
You know about Hirak?

694
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,867
We'll go there only...

695
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,867
What does that mean?

696
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:42,199
We are invited...

697
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,864
...in the rain repletion function...

698
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,202
No... no... trust repletion
function...

699
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:47,368
Hirak has gained a lot of trust.
. hence the function...

700
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:48,876
Why are you invited?

701
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,877
We are the son-in-laws
of Shundi's king...

702
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,882
There are twin kings... ones
daughter is my wife...

703
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,383
the others daughter is his wife...

704
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:58,888
The king has become old, so he
said I won't go... you two go...

705
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,318
If you are the son-in-laws of
the king then why are you...

706
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,823
...wearing these kind of clothes.

707
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:02,984
Camouflage...

708
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,823
If any one recognises
us... that's why...

709
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,831
What do you know about
the king of Hirak?

710
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:11,831
We don't know anything...
but we want to know...

711
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:14,996
You won't know...

712
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,173
there is no one else more tyrant
than the king of Hirak...

713
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,847
He never lets outsiders
know about the truth...

714
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,844
he is mad... he has become crazy...

715
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,859
the earlier king was a good one...

716
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:40,863
the present king killed him
and sat on his throne...

717
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,865
Is that so... really?

718
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,866
He made lots of money
from the diamonds...

719
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,872
what ever diamond is found...
it goes straight to the king...

720
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,876
the workers are whipped
and made to work...

721
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,879
poor people starve here...

722
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,974
Those who rebel are
tamed by magic...

723
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:04,316
they keep on chanting
the king's words...

724
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:05,820
Does the king know magic?

725
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:10,826
The king has a man...
he knows magic...

726
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:14,830
there is a room in the palace.
. the laboratory room...

727
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,991
Outsiders are not allowed
in that room...

728
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,830
what ever happens, happens there...

729
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,837
We know...

730
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:27,841
I had a school... the only school.

731
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,846
He forcibly shut it down.

732
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,847
. so that the children
remain ignorant...

733
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,010
Learning brings knowledge...

734
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:37,849
gives the power to differentiate
between good and bad...

735
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:39,855
The king doesn't want that...

736
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,857
You are a teacher?

737
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:47,863
He wanted to tame me too.
. but I escaped...

738
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:52,866
now I hide in this hill.
. at times...

739
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,029
soldiers.

740
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,353
They are gone...

741
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:51,359
I am saved...

742
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,863
they won't come here
for some time...

743
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,867
now I can stay here without risk...

744
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:00,800
Won't you return to the country?

745
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:04,806
I will... I have to...

746
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:10,813
I have to do something
about the situation...

747
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,809
I'll return when I'll get a dress...

748
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,816
You can get a dress
if you want one...

749
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:22,824
It's not a common dress...
it's a special dress...

750
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,821
Shall I tell him?

751
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:27,328
Tell him... no harm in it...

752
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,826
Promise that you won't
tell anybody...

753
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:31,992
What?

754
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,832
We know magic...

755
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,838
, We get whatever clothes
we ask for...

756
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:38,339
We get whatever we want to eat...

757
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:42,845
With these shoes on we can
go anywhere we want...

758
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:47,849
And when we sing, no one can move...

759
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:50,009
Do you want to see some magic?

760
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:53,180
Okay... see... we'll go on the rock...

761
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:57,186
see... on the rock...

762
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:07,801
Now near the pond... near the pond...

763
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,803
We are here...

764
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,811
now we'll go back to you...

765
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,813
in front of the caves...
In front of the cave...

766
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:20,144
here we are!

767
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,148
Now tell us what do
you want to eat...

768
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:27,814
let us bring you some food...

769
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:31,827
Later... tell me first whether
you are in my group or not...

770
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,826
I need the help of your magic...

771
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,157
We are in the good peoples' group...

772
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,323
Yes, we are in the good
peoples' group...

773
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:38,833
we had disclosed the conspiracy
of the prime minister of Halla.

774
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,162
We want good for you...

775
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:41,328
Yes...

776
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:42,837
My good is not so important...

777
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,838
I want this country's good...

778
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,001
the country men's good...

779
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,339
We want that only...

780
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:54,850
Then listen to me carefully.
. you'll go there...

781
00:55:54,918 --> 00:56:00,117
you'll be the king's guest...
you'll get cordial reception...

782
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,785
You'll pretend to be happy...
the king will also be happy...

783
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,951
then you will want to
see the diamond mine...

784
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,792
Why... why would we want
to see the diamond mine...

785
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,798
There is a reason... you'll
understand later...

786
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:11,297
he won't show you
the mine himself...

787
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,131
...but he will show you
if you want to see it...

788
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:14,962
will you remember...

789
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,801
Of course we will...

790
00:57:31,212 --> 00:57:38,050
Stupid... fool... uncouth.
. mean... failure...

791
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:42,214
you are wearing diamond necklace
but you neglect your work...

792
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:44,053
No, your majesty... no, o king...

793
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:46,059
No, I don't want to
listen to anything...

794
00:57:46,394 --> 00:57:48,055
I want you to bring Udayan here...

795
00:57:48,229 --> 00:57:50,060
otherwise you all will have it...

796
00:57:50,131 --> 00:57:52,065
Brain washing...

797
00:57:54,135 --> 00:57:56,228
100 soldiers are looking
for him for 1 month...

798
00:57:56,304 --> 00:58:00,070
100 pairs of eyes are searching but
why are not they finding Udayan.

799
00:58:00,141 --> 00:58:01,233
What is this?

800
00:58:01,309 --> 00:58:03,402
Negligence... negligence...
negligence in work...

801
00:58:03,477 --> 00:58:07,072
All swindlers... where is your
binocular, scientist?

802
00:58:08,249 --> 00:58:11,082
It's kept near the window,
your majesty...

803
00:58:11,152 --> 00:58:14,087
Can you see anything through that...
does that machine work?

804
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:18,024
It's a powerful device,
your majesty...

805
00:58:18,092 --> 00:58:22,028
things of far of places come
closer to you in a moment...

806
00:58:22,363 --> 00:58:28,029
Good... fix your eyes in it...
this is your only work now...

807
00:58:28,202 --> 00:58:30,033
go back to your room...

808
00:58:32,106 --> 00:58:38,045
Remember you all, Udayan is
the biggest enemy of Hirak...

809
00:58:38,112 --> 00:58:42,048
if he creates some problem
just before the function...

810
00:58:42,116 --> 00:58:43,378
Everything will be destroyed...

811
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:47,046
He doesn't have manpower, your
majesty... he is alone...

812
00:58:47,121 --> 00:58:49,055
Stupid...

813
00:58:56,230 --> 00:59:00,064
Court astrologer, how far are
you with your calculations?

814
00:59:00,134 --> 00:59:01,226
I have finished, your majesty...

815
00:59:01,302 --> 00:59:03,395
Tell me first, whether we
can find Udayan or not...

816
00:59:04,572 --> 00:59:08,406
It has 99% chances...

817
00:59:08,476 --> 00:59:10,239
Good... good... very good...

818
00:59:10,311 --> 00:59:12,245
what else do the stars
and planets say?

819
00:59:12,313 --> 00:59:15,077
There will be peace
everywhere in Hirak...

820
00:59:15,149 --> 00:59:16,343
Well... what else?

821
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:21,013
Starting from the day
after the function...

822
00:59:21,088 --> 00:59:23,022
And how long will it remain?

823
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:25,024
As long as you want...

824
00:59:25,092 --> 00:59:26,184
Very good... very good...

825
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,522
But...

826
00:59:27,595 --> 00:59:29,028
What's the confusion?

827
00:59:31,198 --> 00:59:35,191
Saturn, Venus and Mercury
these three planets...

828
00:59:35,269 --> 00:59:40,036
What? Revolt? Epidemic?
People will die?

829
00:59:40,107 --> 00:59:45,044
No... no... no... not that... but...

830
00:59:45,212 --> 00:59:47,043
Then what?

831
00:59:50,217 --> 00:59:52,048
Don't be afraid... tell me...

832
00:59:52,386 --> 00:59:54,047
Brain washing...

833
00:59:54,221 --> 00:59:56,052
I want that... but whose?

834
00:59:57,224 --> 01:00:02,059
Hirak's biggest enemy's...

835
01:00:10,137 --> 01:00:13,072
Give one of the best diamond
to the astrologer...

836
01:02:19,066 --> 01:02:21,000
We have come from Shundi, o king...

837
01:02:21,068 --> 01:02:23,002
I am very happy...

838
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,332
We are also happy...

839
01:02:24,405 --> 01:02:28,000
I am eager to listen to your music...

840
01:02:28,075 --> 01:02:31,010
We have already composed
a song, your majesty...

841
01:02:31,078 --> 01:02:33,342
It's a function of happiness, so
every body will be happy if...

842
01:02:33,414 --> 01:02:35,177
...you sing a happy song.

843
01:02:35,249 --> 01:02:36,341
Certainly...

844
01:02:36,417 --> 01:02:42,014
You don't worry, your majesty...
we are very happy to be here...

845
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:32,004
Is this a diamond?

846
01:03:32,072 --> 01:03:33,164
Yes...

847
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,003
Diamond of your mine?

848
01:03:36,176 --> 01:03:38,007
How many grams?

849
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:41,011
Diamond is weighed not in
grams but in carats...

850
01:03:41,081 --> 01:03:42,173
Very good...

851
01:03:42,249 --> 01:03:46,015
We wanted to see your diamond
mine once, your majesty...

852
01:03:47,187 --> 01:03:52,022
Our father-in-law has said, if
possible see the diamond mine once.

853
01:03:52,626 --> 01:03:56,357
He said, you get to learn a
lot from the diamond mine...

854
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,364
He said, the king of Hirak is
a very good soul... - Yes...

855
01:03:58,432 --> 01:04:00,024
He said, the king of Hirak
will show you if you want...

856
01:04:02,636 --> 01:04:04,035
Well... you can see that...

857
01:04:04,204 --> 01:04:06,195
after the inauguration
of the statue...

858
01:04:06,273 --> 01:04:07,365
That will be great!

859
01:04:09,376 --> 01:04:13,039
Keeping revenues due is
not a good thing to do...

860
01:04:13,213 --> 01:04:16,979
Keeping revenues due is
not a good thing to do...

861
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:20,985
Keeping revenues due is
not a good thing to do...

862
01:04:21,155 --> 01:04:23,988
Even if one doesn't have food, one
should always...

863
01:04:24,058 --> 01:04:25,992
...pay the king his revenues.

864
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,995
Even if we die, the king
of Hirak is god...

865
01:04:31,065 --> 01:04:35,331
Even if we die, the king
of Hirak is god...

866
01:04:44,611 --> 01:04:47,011
The king of Hirak is a god...

867
01:04:47,081 --> 01:04:50,016
The king of Hirak is a god...

868
01:04:57,091 --> 01:04:59,025
Who is that man, your majesty?

869
01:04:59,093 --> 01:05:03,029
Farmer... poor thing... they
work in the open fields...

870
01:05:03,097 --> 01:05:04,530
so he must have gone mad
by the scorching heat...

871
01:05:04,598 --> 01:05:06,031
Are they farmers?

872
01:05:06,366 --> 01:05:10,029
They are farmers and those are the
workers of the diamond mine.

873
01:05:13,107 --> 01:05:14,540
They are allowed in the court?

874
01:05:14,608 --> 01:05:17,975
Why not... they are
also human beings...

875
01:05:19,046 --> 01:05:20,138
That's true...

876
01:05:20,214 --> 01:05:22,978
Yes, you can't allow a cow or
a goat in the royal court...

877
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:40,994
All you respected guests
please lend me an ear,

878
01:05:41,068 --> 01:05:44,003
The function will start from
this auspicious moment.

879
01:05:47,407 --> 01:05:51,002
Hirak is a small country and it
wants the elders to bless it.

880
01:05:51,078 --> 01:05:54,013
Hope that peace will always
prevail in this country,

881
01:05:57,084 --> 01:06:01,020
Hope that the king and it's
subjects always...

882
01:06:01,088 --> 01:06:04,023
...keep themselves in noble work.

883
01:06:07,094 --> 01:06:10,029
The function beings with a song...

884
01:06:10,097 --> 01:06:13,032
...and to present that
song is present here.

885
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:20,038
Two great personalities who are
adorning the court with their grace.

886
01:06:20,207 --> 01:06:24,041
They are the two son-in-laws
of Shundi, they are singer...

887
01:06:24,111 --> 01:06:27,046
...Gupinath and his friend
drummer Bagaha.

888
01:06:27,214 --> 01:06:31,048
I request them with folded hands
so that they start their...

889
01:06:31,118 --> 01:06:34,053
...music without wasting time.

890
01:06:45,566 --> 01:06:47,056
Where is my drum?

891
01:06:59,146 --> 01:07:03,082
We are very happy to be at Hirak's
rain repletion function...

892
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:05,084
Trust repletion...

893
01:07:05,152 --> 01:07:10,089
Yes, trust repletion function...

894
01:07:10,157 --> 01:07:13,092
The king wanted us to
sing a happy song...

895
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,094
Delightful song...
- What? - Delightful song...

896
01:07:15,162 --> 01:07:20,031
Oh yes, delightful song... we
will sing a delightful song...

897
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,033
Tell them about movements...

898
01:07:23,103 --> 01:07:25,037
Yes...

899
01:07:25,105 --> 01:07:29,201
what I want to say is our teacher,
who taught us music was...

900
01:07:29,276 --> 01:07:31,369
...not a common man.

901
01:07:31,545 --> 01:07:36,039
Many of his predictions
have become true...

902
01:07:36,383 --> 01:07:43,050
so he said, when you will sing
tell everybody not to move...

903
01:07:43,123 --> 01:07:46,388
Though we don't know what will
happen if some body moves...

904
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,052
he didn't tell us that...

905
01:07:48,128 --> 01:07:49,390
No... he didn't tell anything...

906
01:07:49,463 --> 01:07:52,057
But I thought if anything happens...

907
01:07:52,132 --> 01:07:53,224
It has to happen...

908
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:56,235
So I thought I should tell you...

909
01:07:56,303 --> 01:08:01,400
so please be careful while
listening to the music... you also.

910
01:08:03,143 --> 01:08:05,077
Please be careful... you all please
be careful... you too...

911
01:08:05,145 --> 01:08:07,079
don't move while the music is on...

912
01:08:07,414 --> 01:08:10,076
So can we start now, your majesty?

913
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:12,081
Start... start...

914
01:08:17,357 --> 01:08:22,021
Coming to Hirak, and seeing the
glitters of it's diamonds...

915
01:08:23,363 --> 01:08:28,027
Getting such cordial reception
and seeing the grace of the king.

916
01:08:29,369 --> 01:08:33,032
Our hearts are filled
with happiness

917
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:38,367
Our hearts are filled with
happiness...

918
01:08:38,445 --> 01:08:41,039
...we want to tell you all about that

919
01:08:41,381 --> 01:08:44,373
Coming to Hirak, and seeing the
glitters of it's diamonds...

920
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:48,046
Getting such cordial reception
and seeing the grace of the king.

921
01:08:48,121 --> 01:08:50,555
Our hearts are filled with
happiness...

922
01:08:50,624 --> 01:08:53,058
...we want to tell you all about that

923
01:09:05,405 --> 01:09:10,069
The king is so witty, the
king is so broad minded

924
01:09:11,411 --> 01:09:16,075
The king is so fun loving, the
king has such a good temperament

925
01:09:17,617 --> 01:09:21,018
Our heart has filled

926
01:09:21,088 --> 01:09:26,025
Our heart has filled, we
want to tell you that

927
01:09:26,193 --> 01:09:30,027
The king is so witty, the
king is so broad minded

928
01:09:30,097 --> 01:09:33,032
The king is so fun loving, the
king has such a good temperament

929
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:38,037
Our heart has filled, we
want to tell you that

930
01:09:50,384 --> 01:09:54,047
Every body say hail
the king of Hirak

931
01:09:56,123 --> 01:09:59,388
Every body say hail
the king of Hirak

932
01:10:01,128 --> 01:10:05,394
How many kings are like him?

933
01:10:07,134 --> 01:10:11,070
How many kings are like him?

934
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:18,007
After seeing so many countries...

935
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:23,343
...we have come to Hirak
and now our heart says.

936
01:10:25,519 --> 01:10:30,013
After seeing so many countries,
we have come to Hirak and...

937
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:32,024
...now our heart says.

938
01:10:32,092 --> 01:10:36,028
No king is better than
the king of Hirak

939
01:10:36,096 --> 01:10:40,032
No king is better than
the king of Hirak

940
01:10:41,201 --> 01:10:50,041
We want to tell you all about
that through our song

941
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:54,046
We want to tell you all about
that through our song

942
01:12:05,385 --> 01:12:07,546
Ladder... where is the ladder...

943
01:13:19,492 --> 01:13:20,982
Diamond mine...

944
01:13:21,061 --> 01:13:23,154
Diamond was discovered here
3 years back... right?

945
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:24,993
Right... right...

946
01:13:25,065 --> 01:13:26,157
Discovery of diamond...

947
01:13:26,233 --> 01:13:27,325
I'm having goose pimples...

948
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,992
You all do your work...

949
01:14:04,204 --> 01:14:05,535
Look here... diamond is
stuck to the rock...

950
01:14:05,605 --> 01:14:07,038
We found it today only,
your majesty...

951
01:14:07,207 --> 01:14:08,367
Diamond...

952
01:14:08,441 --> 01:14:11,035
Who got this diamond?

953
01:14:11,111 --> 01:14:12,203
We have so many workers here...

954
01:14:12,279 --> 01:14:14,042
it's not easy to say who got it...

955
01:14:14,114 --> 01:14:16,309
Who ever gets it it's
a royal property...

956
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:19,985
workers don't get diamond,
they get wages...

957
01:14:20,153 --> 01:14:21,984
Moreover what will the workers
do with a diamond?

958
01:14:22,055 --> 01:14:23,989
They won't know the value of it...

959
01:14:24,057 --> 01:14:25,991
Don't under estimate the workers...

960
01:14:26,059 --> 01:14:27,321
they are the people
who work... right?

961
01:14:27,394 --> 01:14:28,986
Right... right...

962
01:14:29,062 --> 01:14:30,324
Very tough job...

963
01:14:30,397 --> 01:14:31,989
Certainly...

964
01:14:45,345 --> 01:14:48,007
Isn't the work you do, difficult?

965
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:01,020
Can you hear me...
isn't it difficult?

966
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:08,031
Those who work in the mines...

967
01:15:08,101 --> 01:15:10,035
...even the god of
death is afraid of them.

968
01:15:10,103 --> 01:15:11,365
Those who work in the mines...

969
01:15:11,438 --> 01:15:13,030
...even the god of
death is afraid of them.

970
01:15:13,106 --> 01:15:15,199
There is no repentance even we
are empty stomach...

971
01:15:15,275 --> 01:15:16,970
...eating stomach full
makes people fat.

972
01:15:17,043 --> 01:15:18,476
There is no repentance even we
are empty stomach, eating...

973
01:15:18,545 --> 01:15:19,978
...stomach full makes people fat.

974
01:15:20,146 --> 01:15:25,982
The workers are great, the
king of Hirak is a god.

975
01:17:13,159 --> 01:17:16,094
Suagta... Sugata...

976
01:17:20,533 --> 01:17:22,023
Teacher?!

977
01:17:22,202 --> 01:17:23,533
Listen...

978
01:17:23,603 --> 01:17:25,195
tell all of your friends that
every body should be present...

979
01:17:25,271 --> 01:17:27,034
...there in the statue
ground tomorrow.

980
01:17:27,106 --> 01:17:29,040
...early in the morning...

981
01:17:29,108 --> 01:17:30,200
Can you do that?

982
01:17:30,276 --> 01:17:31,368
Yes, I can...

983
01:17:31,444 --> 01:17:33,537
So don't be late... go now...

984
01:17:33,613 --> 01:17:35,046
What about school, teacher?

985
01:17:36,216 --> 01:17:39,049
School will open...
it will open soon...

986
01:17:39,219 --> 01:17:41,050
Don't worry, your majesty...

987
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,054
there are guards all
around the city...

988
01:17:43,122 --> 01:17:46,057
if he comes back the guards
will catch him...

989
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:47,387
He can't escape...

990
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:48,552
He can't escape... he can't escape...

991
01:17:48,628 --> 01:17:51,062
You must catch him... you must...

992
01:17:54,133 --> 01:17:57,398
I know that everything
is his plan...

993
01:18:02,242 --> 01:18:06,406
he had come and even convinced
the school children...

994
01:18:08,248 --> 01:18:10,079
How dare he...

995
01:18:10,149 --> 01:18:15,086
he threw stone at the face of my
statue in front of so many people.

996
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:19,024
How dare he...

997
01:18:20,093 --> 01:18:21,526
...he thought he'll
snatch away my throne...

998
01:18:21,594 --> 01:18:24,028
He'll die... he'll die...

999
01:18:24,197 --> 01:18:27,030
Listen all of you... tonight
you'll stay in this room...

1000
01:18:27,367 --> 01:18:29,198
no sleep for tonight...

1001
01:18:31,104 --> 01:18:33,038
I'll be in my room...

1002
01:18:33,106 --> 01:18:36,200
God knows what problem
he is going to creat...

1003
01:18:36,276 --> 01:18:39,040
if any body gets him report
me immediately... then...

1004
01:18:39,112 --> 01:18:41,046
Brain washing...

1005
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,360
Bagha...

1006
01:19:35,435 --> 01:19:36,527
Um?

1007
01:19:37,103 --> 01:19:38,365
Have you fallen asleep?

1008
01:19:38,438 --> 01:19:39,530
Hm...

1009
01:19:39,606 --> 01:19:41,039
You can't fall asleep...

1010
01:19:41,207 --> 01:19:42,538
I know...

1011
01:19:42,609 --> 01:19:45,043
Then why have you closed your eyes?

1012
01:19:45,111 --> 01:19:46,544
I am resting...

1013
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:00,558
Ah... ah...

1014
01:22:04,217 --> 01:22:06,048
Go to your laboratory, scientist...

1015
01:22:06,119 --> 01:22:08,053
some one needs brain washing...

1016
01:22:13,126 --> 01:22:14,559
I have seen him...

1017
01:22:16,729 --> 01:22:17,991
...in the northern forest...

1018
01:22:31,077 --> 01:22:33,341
Bagha... Bagha... light...

1019
01:22:37,083 --> 01:22:39,017
We have come... we are here...

1020
01:22:43,089 --> 01:22:47,025
Listen... the farmers and the
workers have been informed...

1021
01:22:47,093 --> 01:22:48,355
they will be at the statue ground...

1022
01:22:48,427 --> 01:22:50,019
...at the break of dawn...
they are in our group...

1023
01:22:50,096 --> 01:22:51,188
That's great!

1024
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:54,028
Now we have to bring the
soldiers in our group...

1025
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:55,192
How...

1026
01:22:55,268 --> 01:22:58,032
All royal servants take
bribe in this country...

1027
01:22:58,204 --> 01:23:00,035
We'll bribe them?

1028
01:23:01,107 --> 01:23:05,043
Diamonds... no one can resist
the temptation for diamonds...

1029
01:23:05,211 --> 01:23:07,042
But how will we get diamonds?

1030
01:23:07,113 --> 01:23:10,048
Now you two go back to the palace...

1031
01:23:10,116 --> 01:23:12,209
find out where the royal
treasury is...

1032
01:23:12,285 --> 01:23:14,048
We don't have to find
it out, teacher...

1033
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,382
we can go there by clapping
our hands...

1034
01:23:15,454 --> 01:23:16,978
No... no... that won't do...
- Why?

1035
01:23:17,056 --> 01:23:20,992
You cant open chest by clapping...
won't get the keys either...

1036
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:24,996
the guard will have the
key of the treasury...

1037
01:23:25,064 --> 01:23:27,157
...but he might not have
the key for the chest...

1038
01:23:27,233 --> 01:23:28,996
In case he has...

1039
01:23:29,068 --> 01:23:31,002
Then it's well and good...
take both of them...

1040
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:35,166
and if he doesn't have
then take his spear...

1041
01:23:35,241 --> 01:23:36,503
Okay...

1042
01:23:37,176 --> 01:23:39,167
Open the door of the treasury...

1043
01:23:39,245 --> 01:23:44,012
break the chest with the spear
and take out the diamonds...

1044
01:23:44,083 --> 01:23:45,345
tell me, can you do it?
- Of course we can...

1045
01:23:45,418 --> 01:23:48,012
...I play drum...
my hands are very strong...

1046
01:23:48,087 --> 01:23:53,184
Very good... take this...
it has rope and towel...

1047
01:23:53,259 --> 01:23:54,351
Yes... yes...

1048
01:23:54,427 --> 01:23:57,191
Tie the guards hands, legs,
and mouth with these...

1049
01:23:57,263 --> 01:23:58,355
Yes...

1050
01:23:58,431 --> 01:24:02,026
Then open the door of the treasury
and break the chest...

1051
01:24:02,101 --> 01:24:04,035
take the diamonds and
come back to me...

1052
01:24:04,103 --> 01:24:08,039
Yes... - I'll stay near by... in
front of the temple of Kal Vairav...

1053
01:24:08,107 --> 01:24:09,199
Kal Vairav...

1054
01:24:09,275 --> 01:24:10,367
Kal Vairav...

1055
01:24:10,443 --> 01:24:13,207
then tomorrow at the break of dawn...

1056
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:16,043
our work will start
in the statue ground.

1057
01:24:17,383 --> 01:24:18,975
We can stop war, teacher...

1058
01:24:20,052 --> 01:24:22,987
This can't be stopped...
this war should happen...

1059
01:24:23,055 --> 01:24:24,147
no one will die...

1060
01:24:24,223 --> 01:24:26,987
only we'll pull down the
king from his throne...

1061
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:30,993
Getting rid of nuisance
is the first priority...

1062
01:24:31,163 --> 01:24:32,994
is everything clear?
- Yes...

1063
01:24:33,599 --> 01:24:37,000
I'll leave now... remember...
temple of Kal Vairav...

1064
01:24:42,174 --> 01:24:44,005
Let's see what is inside...

1065
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:48,512
Who's that...

1066
01:25:20,046 --> 01:25:21,308
Who are you?

1067
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:23,143
I am Charandas... I am a singer...

1068
01:25:23,215 --> 01:25:24,477
Who did this to you?

1069
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:25,983
Royal soldiers...

1070
01:25:26,652 --> 01:25:27,983
You are singing in spite of that?

1071
01:25:28,054 --> 01:25:32,991
There is music till there
is life... but I am hungry...

1072
01:25:33,159 --> 01:25:34,319
Would you like to eat something?

1073
01:25:34,393 --> 01:25:36,156
Yes... if I can get some milk...

1074
01:25:36,228 --> 01:25:38,162
You want to have milk?
- Yes...

1075
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:39,993
Wait... I'll give you...

1076
01:26:11,097 --> 01:26:14,032
Look good people are
living in a broken hut

1077
01:26:15,101 --> 01:26:20,038
And bad people is sitting
on a throne

1078
01:26:21,107 --> 01:26:27,046
Look good people are
living in a broken hut

1079
01:26:27,113 --> 01:26:31,049
And bad people is sitting
on a throne

1080
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:39,058
Those who harvest golden crops,
don't have food for themselves

1081
01:26:40,126 --> 01:26:44,392
Those who harvest golden crops,
don't have food for themselves

1082
01:26:44,463 --> 01:26:49,560
Teacher, I won't rest before
teaching you a lesson...

1083
01:27:24,103 --> 01:27:27,038
We shouldn't go in this dress...
they will think us thieves...

1084
01:27:27,106 --> 01:27:28,368
Then...

1085
01:27:28,707 --> 01:27:30,197
They won't suspect
us in royal dress...

1086
01:27:30,276 --> 01:27:31,538
...after all we are
the king's guest...

1087
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:34,044
Right... rather we
will be respected...

1088
01:27:34,113 --> 01:27:35,205
Right...

1089
01:27:39,118 --> 01:27:40,380
Royal dress...

1090
01:27:49,128 --> 01:27:51,062
How are you, guard?

1091
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:54,065
We have come from Shundi...
for the function...

1092
01:27:54,133 --> 01:27:55,566
We are the kings guest...

1093
01:27:57,570 --> 01:28:00,403
The king said, go and see
the royal treasury...

1094
01:28:00,473 --> 01:28:02,566
He said that we can learn a lot...

1095
01:28:12,151 --> 01:28:15,086
So if you give us the keys...

1096
01:28:17,089 --> 01:28:22,026
It will be better if you
open the door yourself...

1097
01:28:22,361 --> 01:28:24,022
Where is the permit?

1098
01:28:24,196 --> 01:28:26,027
Permit?

1099
01:28:26,098 --> 01:28:28,032
Yes, I need to see the permit...

1100
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:30,193
Don't you believe me?
You are asking...

1101
01:28:30,269 --> 01:28:32,032
...for the permit from
me... you are very...

1102
01:28:32,104 --> 01:28:34,038
Without permit you can't
go inside the treasury...

1103
01:28:43,549 --> 01:28:45,039
There is only one key...

1104
01:28:45,117 --> 01:28:50,054
I know I have seen... let's go
inside... then we will break the chest...

1105
01:28:51,123 --> 01:28:54,058
We can break the chest with
this spear... what do you say?

1106
01:28:54,226 --> 01:28:56,217
Yes... and moreover we know magic...
- Yes...

1107
01:28:56,295 --> 01:28:57,557
No body can stop us from
entering the treasury...

1108
01:28:57,630 --> 01:28:59,063
Yes... let's go...
- Let's go...

1109
01:29:02,134 --> 01:29:03,226
Hey... stop...

1110
01:29:03,302 --> 01:29:06,396
Don't touch, don't
touch us, you guard

1111
01:29:10,142 --> 01:29:14,078
Don't touch, don't
touch us, you guard

1112
01:29:14,146 --> 01:29:17,013
Why are you raising your hand?

1113
01:29:17,082 --> 01:29:19,016
Don't touch

1114
01:29:20,085 --> 01:29:21,177
Don't touch

1115
01:29:21,253 --> 01:29:22,345
Don't touch

1116
01:29:24,089 --> 01:29:28,185
Don't move... don't move... don't
move... you stay there

1117
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:32,026
You stay there because
we don't have much time

1118
01:29:32,097 --> 01:29:33,359
We don't have much time,
we don't have much time...

1119
01:29:33,432 --> 01:29:34,524
...we don't have much time

1120
01:29:38,103 --> 01:29:40,037
Don't look at this side

1121
01:29:42,107 --> 01:29:46,373
Don't look at this side,
don't see, don't see

1122
01:29:50,115 --> 01:29:52,049
Now we two son-in-law
of Shundi's king...

1123
01:29:54,119 --> 01:29:58,055
Now we two son-in-law of Shundi's
king will do robbery

1124
01:29:59,225 --> 01:30:02,217
Now we will do robbery
at this hour of night

1125
01:30:02,294 --> 01:30:05,058
Now we will do robbery
at this hour of night

1126
01:30:09,134 --> 01:30:11,068
Tell me why are you so sad?

1127
01:30:13,239 --> 01:30:15,230
Tell me why are you so sad?

1128
01:30:15,307 --> 01:30:18,003
You look at that side

1129
01:30:18,077 --> 01:30:19,169
You look at that side

1130
01:30:19,245 --> 01:30:20,337
You look at that side

1131
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:26,177
Turn that side... turn that side...
turn that side, o guard

1132
01:30:26,252 --> 01:30:29,016
O guard... o guard... o guard...

1133
01:30:59,118 --> 01:31:01,052
Sing a song...

1134
01:31:04,123 --> 01:31:05,556
Where is the music?

1135
01:31:12,131 --> 01:31:17,000
Do Re Mi... Do Mi Mi...

1136
01:31:20,172 --> 01:31:21,332
We are gone...

1137
01:31:22,174 --> 01:31:24,005
Do Mi Fa Mi

1138
01:31:25,077 --> 01:31:26,339
Where is the song?

1139
01:31:27,079 --> 01:31:29,013
Pardon me...

1140
01:31:38,090 --> 01:31:43,027
Pardon me tiger uncle,
don't be angry, uncle

1141
01:31:43,195 --> 01:31:47,029
Who knew that you are here

1142
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:52,036
Who knew that you are here

1143
01:31:52,371 --> 01:32:04,044
Who knew that you are here

1144
01:32:04,216 --> 01:32:08,050
Who knew that you are here

1145
01:32:10,389 --> 01:32:14,052
This is like thunder without
the hint of cloud

1146
01:32:15,127 --> 01:32:18,995
This is like thunder without
the hint of cloud

1147
01:32:20,165 --> 01:32:23,999
This is like thunder without
the hint of cloud

1148
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:27,334
This is like thunder without
the hint of cloud

1149
01:32:27,506 --> 01:32:31,169
Seems like all our
plans will be failed

1150
01:32:31,243 --> 01:32:35,009
Seems like all our
plans will be failed

1151
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:37,011
Seems like all our
plans will be failed

1152
01:32:37,082 --> 01:32:40,017
This is like thunder without
the hint of cloud

1153
01:32:40,185 --> 01:32:43,018
Seems like all our
plans will be failed

1154
01:32:43,088 --> 01:32:51,018
Please stay still
over there, uncle

1155
01:32:51,096 --> 01:32:55,032
Who knew that you are here

1156
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:59,030
Who knew that you are here

1157
01:33:01,206 --> 01:33:10,046
If your paw comes
on our shoulder...

1158
01:33:10,115 --> 01:33:18,318
If your paw comes
on our shoulder...

1159
01:33:23,061 --> 01:33:27,998
If your paw comes
on our shoulder...

1160
01:33:28,066 --> 01:33:31,001
I know what will happen

1161
01:33:31,069 --> 01:33:35,005
We lose two fresh lives...

1162
01:33:35,507 --> 01:33:38,999
We lose two fresh lives...

1163
01:33:39,178 --> 01:33:44,013
We lose two fresh lives...

1164
01:33:44,082 --> 01:33:51,011
We lose two fresh lives...

1165
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:56,026
Who knew that you are here

1166
01:33:56,195 --> 01:34:00,029
Who knew that you are here

1167
01:34:01,099 --> 01:34:06,366
Bagha... Bagha... how many
diamonds have you taken?

1168
01:34:06,438 --> 01:34:10,033
Bagha... Bagha... how many
diamonds have you taken?

1169
01:34:10,108 --> 01:34:11,200
I don't have time to count...

1170
01:34:11,276 --> 01:34:13,039
Make an assumption and tell me how
many diamonds have you taken?

1171
01:34:13,111 --> 01:34:15,045
I have taken enough...

1172
01:34:15,113 --> 01:34:17,308
No need to take more...

1173
01:34:17,382 --> 01:34:19,976
No need to take more...

1174
01:34:20,052 --> 01:34:21,986
Let's go out from here now

1175
01:34:22,054 --> 01:34:23,988
Let's go out from here now

1176
01:34:24,056 --> 01:34:28,993
We are narrowly saved

1177
01:34:29,061 --> 01:34:32,997
We are narrowly saved

1178
01:34:33,065 --> 01:34:38,002
That's enough... that's enough

1179
01:34:44,076 --> 01:34:45,338
Let's go...

1180
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:47,002
Let's change the dress...

1181
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:49,013
Yes... like before...

1182
01:34:49,081 --> 01:34:50,343
Dress like before...

1183
01:34:51,183 --> 01:34:53,014
What is the name of the place?

1184
01:34:53,085 --> 01:34:54,177
Temple of Kal Vairav...

1185
01:34:54,253 --> 01:34:55,345
Kal Vairav...

1186
01:34:55,687 --> 01:34:57,018
Teacher...

1187
01:34:59,091 --> 01:35:00,524
teacher...

1188
01:35:02,094 --> 01:35:04,028
teacher... teacher...

1189
01:35:26,318 --> 01:35:27,979
Bagha...

1190
01:35:34,059 --> 01:35:35,151
they have caught him...

1191
01:35:35,227 --> 01:35:36,319
What a disaster

1192
01:35:36,395 --> 01:35:39,159
If they take him to that
room and tame him?

1193
01:35:39,231 --> 01:35:40,493
Which room?

1194
01:35:40,566 --> 01:35:41,999
The laboratory...

1195
01:35:42,067 --> 01:35:43,500
O my god...

1196
01:35:46,338 --> 01:35:50,001
let's go there... if we can
stop them from taming him...

1197
01:38:04,676 --> 01:38:15,075
Keeping revenues due is
not a good thing to do...

1198
01:38:15,153 --> 01:38:21,023
Even if one doesn't have food,
one should always...

1199
01:38:21,093 --> 01:38:24,028
...pay the king his revenues...

1200
01:38:24,096 --> 01:38:35,530
Even if we die, the king
of Hirak is god...

1201
01:38:48,553 --> 01:38:51,386
Is this the room where
the king tame people?

1202
01:38:52,224 --> 01:38:55,057
This is the room... this
is the laboratory...

1203
01:38:55,227 --> 01:38:58,060
What is this?

1204
01:38:58,130 --> 01:38:59,392
This is the room.

1205
01:38:59,464 --> 01:39:01,557
And that demon?

1206
01:39:01,633 --> 01:39:03,066
That's the devil...

1207
01:39:04,236 --> 01:39:08,070
Okay... so if this
handle is pressed...

1208
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:11,075
...then the devil spells
out sentences...

1209
01:39:11,143 --> 01:39:15,079
And the people kept in that
room are tamed that way...

1210
01:39:15,147 --> 01:39:17,012
You are right...

1211
01:39:21,186 --> 01:39:23,017
...this is for the farmer...

1212
01:39:23,188 --> 01:39:28,023
...this is for the workers...
and this is for the teacher...

1213
01:39:28,093 --> 01:39:29,526
And the rest...

1214
01:39:29,594 --> 01:39:31,027
They are empty...

1215
01:39:31,096 --> 01:39:35,362
Okay... so you can
put new words here?

1216
01:39:35,433 --> 01:39:37,025
Whatever you want...

1217
01:39:37,369 --> 01:39:39,030
Words for the king...

1218
01:39:39,104 --> 01:39:41,368
Anything... whatever you want...

1219
01:39:44,109 --> 01:39:45,542
You are the king's man...

1220
01:39:46,211 --> 01:39:48,372
I am alone...

1221
01:39:51,216 --> 01:39:56,381
I am alone... I am alone...

1222
01:40:18,176 --> 01:40:20,007
No doubt, your majesty...

1223
01:40:23,081 --> 01:40:27,017
Teacher, you are so cunning...
you are so clever...

1224
01:40:27,085 --> 01:40:29,178
...you conspired against me
along with the farmers...

1225
01:40:29,254 --> 01:40:31,017
...workers and want to ruin me...
you are so unhappy...

1226
01:40:31,089 --> 01:40:33,023
...because your school
doesn't exit... right?

1227
01:40:33,358 --> 01:40:36,020
The school will open again,
your majesty...

1228
01:40:36,194 --> 01:40:39,027
Okay... so who will teach there?

1229
01:40:40,098 --> 01:40:42,032
He, who used to teach earlier...

1230
01:40:42,367 --> 01:40:48,033
What will you teach... after brain
wash what will you teach?

1231
01:40:49,107 --> 01:40:53,043
He who learns dies of hunger...
will you teach that?

1232
01:40:54,112 --> 01:40:57,047
Even if you tame me, my
students will be there...

1233
01:40:57,215 --> 01:40:59,206
...they will grow up one day...

1234
01:40:59,284 --> 01:41:02,048
I've taught them for four years...

1235
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:05,385
I have taught them to understand
the difference between good and bad...

1236
01:41:05,457 --> 01:41:08,051
And if their brains are also washed?

1237
01:41:11,129 --> 01:41:12,562
Look behind you...

1238
01:41:32,083 --> 01:41:38,022
Listen, teacher... what punishment do
the rebels get in other countries...

1239
01:41:38,089 --> 01:41:43,026
...either they have life
imprisonment or they are beheaded...

1240
01:41:43,094 --> 01:41:53,026
...but king of Hirak doesn't kill or
care about the jail or burn alive...

1241
01:41:53,204 --> 01:41:56,037
There is only one punishment
in Hirak...

1242
01:42:11,656 --> 01:42:13,385
Do you want diamonds...

1243
01:42:16,594 --> 01:42:17,993
Iook here...

1244
01:42:31,076 --> 01:42:33,010
Open the door, scientist...
open the door...

1245
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,351
...put them all in that room...

1246
01:42:58,103 --> 01:43:00,037
...put on the teacher's words...

1247
01:43:23,061 --> 01:43:25,495
What happened, scientist... is
your machine out of order?

1248
01:43:49,087 --> 01:43:56,357
I am not a machine... I am not a
machine... I am a living being

1249
01:44:01,099 --> 01:44:08,028
I am not a machine... I am not a
machine... I am a living being

1250
01:44:08,206 --> 01:44:16,136
I know, I know, I know...

1251
01:44:16,214 --> 01:44:22,153
...I know about the devilish
act of the king of Hirak

1252
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:24,984
I know, I know, I know...

1253
01:44:25,056 --> 01:44:30,995
...I know about the devilish
act of the king of Hirak

1254
01:44:36,334 --> 01:44:39,997
The king is cunning,
the king is bad

1255
01:44:40,505 --> 01:44:43,997
The king is cunning, the
king is treacherous

1256
01:44:44,342 --> 01:44:51,009
The king is mean, the king is
cruel, the king is a robber

1257
01:44:52,183 --> 01:44:59,021
The king has crossed the
limits of wrong deeds

1258
01:44:59,090 --> 01:45:03,186
The king has crossed the
limits of wrong deeds

1259
01:45:03,261 --> 01:45:07,197
He has snatched away
food from poor people...

1260
01:45:07,265 --> 01:45:13,033
...and has invited misfortune
to the country

1261
01:45:18,576 --> 01:45:20,976
The king has suppressed them

1262
01:45:22,313 --> 01:45:26,477
The king has suppressed them,
who are afraid of him

1263
01:45:28,486 --> 01:45:31,978
The kings throne is unstable now

1264
01:45:32,056 --> 01:45:35,992
The kings throne is unstable now

1265
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:41,999
Tell king isn't it true...
isn't it true

1266
01:45:42,066 --> 01:45:46,002
The king should get
tough punishment

1267
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:50,006
The king should get
tough punishment

1268
01:45:50,074 --> 01:45:53,009
King, shame on you... shame
on you... shame on you

1269
01:45:53,077 --> 01:45:55,011
King, shame on you... shame
on you... shame on you

1270
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:19,025
Now you listen, o king

1271
01:46:20,104 --> 01:46:27,033
Now you listen, o king

1272
01:46:27,212 --> 01:46:34,050
You won't be spared this time

1273
01:46:35,119 --> 01:46:41,058
You won't be spared this time

1274
01:46:42,227 --> 01:46:50,066
The god of death has come to
take you, you can't escape

1275
01:46:50,134 --> 01:46:57,063
The god of death has come to
take you, you can't escape

1276
01:46:57,242 --> 01:47:05,081
Your days are numbered

1277
01:47:05,149 --> 01:47:11,088
Your days are numbered

1278
01:47:11,155 --> 01:47:13,248
King, shame on you... shame
on you... shame on you

1279
01:47:13,324 --> 01:47:15,087
King, shame on you... shame
on you... shame on you

1280
01:47:16,094 --> 01:47:19,188

King, shame on you... shame

1282
01:47:45,390 --> 01:47:47,381
Catch them...

1283
01:47:47,458 --> 01:47:53,055
King if you do wrong, then
you leave the throne.

1284
01:47:54,132 --> 01:47:59,069
Those who are the kings followers,
their lives are also in danger.

1285
01:48:00,238 --> 01:48:05,073
It's a crime to torture the poor,
king, you won't be spared

1286
01:48:06,144 --> 01:48:11,081
The king of Hirak won't
be spared, he is a devil.

1287
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:15,085
Soldiers, put them
all in that room...
