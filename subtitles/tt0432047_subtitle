1
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,582
Sarkar

2
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:26,290
He was my daughter
Shaalu's friend in college.

3
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,665
That Bhooshan.

4
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,749
I want to meet Sarkar.

5
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,957
That night, after
his college party..

6
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,540
..on the pretext of
offering her a lift home..

7
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,040
..he got her to sit in his car.

8
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,499
And on his way..

9
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,749
..that Bhooshan

10
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:08,290
raped my Shano.

11
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,582
Sarkar, I went to the police too.

12
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:31,415
And like a fool I
approached the court too Sarkar..

13
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:36,749
..but the police and
court made a mockery of her.

14
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,957
They accused my daughter..

15
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,707
..of being loose and..

16
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,874
..that she did all of
this for her greed of money.

17
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:09,207
My Shaalu could not
bear this humiliation..

18
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:16,707
..and she my
daughter killed herself.

19
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,082
These people convinced the court..

20
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:41,082
..that my daughter
was not mentally sound.

21
00:04:54,916 --> 00:05:02,957
Sarkar I had only one child..

22
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,749
..and she too..

23
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,832
Before l die..

24
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,665
..you get me her revenge.

25
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,874
My dead daughter's..

26
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,624
Next time when he
hears that person's name

27
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,540
it should bring a smile on his face.

28
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,832
I don't want to know
who that person is.

29
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,790
Greetings.

30
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,624
Bhooshan, Bandra
- What did you say?

31
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,582
Bhooshan.
- Bhooshan.

32
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,249
Bandra, Carter Road
- Bandra, Carter Road

33
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,832
Bungalow No. 14.

34
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,707
Bungalow No. 14.
- Yes.

35
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,457
It's good we came here
- Otherwise we wouldn't have met.

36
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,749
Why? - The old man is
sending me to Paris.

37
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,874
Can we give you a lift home?
- Come on!

38
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,040
That girl in red
dress belongs to me.

39
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,499
Bhooshan!

40
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,124
Your name is Bhooshan?
- So?

41
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,790
This guy is going to
get real good and hard.

42
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,499
Anyone who interferes
will meet the same fate.

43
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,582
Decide, do you want
to stay back or go?

44
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,082
Who the hell are you?

45
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,082
Please do something.
- Oh my God!

46
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,832
Bhooshan! What are you doing?

47
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,415
Get aside!

48
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,582
Move back!

49
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:33,499
Stand straight.

50
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,749
Stretch him down!

51
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,499
Take this, break him up!

52
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,540
Not on his head, he'll die!

53
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:48,957
Break his leg!

54
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,040
Break his hands

55
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,040
and his limbs now his back!

56
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,124
What are you looking at?

57
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,040
Haven't got any work?
C'mon, mind your own business!

58
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:01,957
Flog him!

59
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,290
Hit him here! Hit him there!

60
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,790
Govinda!

61
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,499
Hello, Rathod sir!

62
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,624
Yes, I'm fine, how about you?

63
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,165
He is in his prayers.

64
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,582
I'll ask him to call

65
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,165
Yes, Madan.

66
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,332
Yes.

67
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,957
Yes, I'm fine.

68
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,165
No you tell me.

69
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,624
What do I say,
Subhash! There's a problem.

70
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:52,957
What use is the Chief Minister's
post if your problems persist?

71
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,207
Khurana may perhaps be
right in what he thinks..

72
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,540
..but where will these people go if
the y lose their homes? To the sea?

73
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,707
Subhash, I do get your point.

74
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:11,915
But Khurana considers
your sympathy for the poor..

75
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:16,790
..to be just a cover to
nurture criminal elements.

76
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,249
I don't stop anyone from thinking.

77
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,957
I stop them from doing.

78
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,040
I value your point ofview..

79
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,374
..but even I'm
answerable to my seniors.

80
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,040
And I, to my people.

81
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,290
I've prepared this sweet Subhash.

82
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,540
Oh, I just finished my breakfast.

83
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,957
Have a little, at least.

84
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,040
Kaka (uncle), how is my dress?

85
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,915
ls it new?
- No it's old.

86
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,082
What question is this, Kaka?

87
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,540
Obviously, it's a new one.
I bought it just yesterday.

88
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,124
Why? Anything special today?

89
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,290
Of course there's something
special! He is coming today.

90
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,832
Who? Oh, Shankar.

91
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,999
Shankar.

92
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,499
Chandar.

93
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,582
How are you?
- Very fine.

94
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,082
Pooja! This is Chandar.
Works with my dad. - Greetings!

95
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,207
Greetings.

96
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:31,540
Hi daddy! Yes, I've reached.

97
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,832
I have come with him.

98
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,374
What does his father do?

99
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,957
Actually l don't really know.

100
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,874
His name is Subhash Nagre.

101
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:55,165
Subhash Nagre? Where did
you find his son? - Meaning?

102
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,499
Do you know who
this Subhash Nagre is?

103
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,374
He is the city's top gangster.

104
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,707
How are you?

105
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:33,540
Am l some little girl to
eat chocolates? - Of course.

106
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:42,624
What's this? I won't
understand the head or tail of it.

107
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,999
It's very simple, papa.

108
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,790
What simple? Kaka can't
even handle a TV remote.

109
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,957
That Shinde's men are up
to their tricks again.

110
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,749
I insisted on setting
them right then and there.

111
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,290
Had we done so, they wouIdn't be
showing their real colours now.

112
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,165
I know how to deal with Shinde.

113
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,499
But what do l do with
your high pitched voice?

114
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,165
You think this is some joke?

115
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:09,415
No, l'm not joking. Come.

116
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:15,082
Look, first send Gaitonde to
Shinde. Then come and inform me.

117
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,624
Sister-in-law, where is brother?

118
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,290
He's gone for his shoot.

119
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,415
Cut it. Okay. Superb.

120
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,582
Print 2 and 4!

121
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:11,832
Hi. How are you, sir?

122
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,540
How are you, star? Come, sit.

123
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:18,874
What star, sir? It's you
who has given me this break.

124
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,707
What break?

125
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:28,415
Am I crazy to put
money on any newcomer?

126
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,415
Thank you, sir.

127
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,374
Right?
- Yes, sir.

128
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,915
What?

129
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,082
You have what it takes, got it?

130
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:45,957
Thank you sir.

131
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,665
And stop applying lipstick. You
look prettier than the heroine.

132
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,707
Well no, sir!

133
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,082
How are you?

134
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,207
Wow! lt's so pretty! For your wife?

135
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,624
For you.

136
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,707
Thanks, Vishnu!

137
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,457
But how can I accept it?
It's so expensive.

138
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,207
Keep it.
- But..

139
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,374
Keep it!

140
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:41,832
Didn't I ask you to keep it?

141
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,665
I'll leave now.

142
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,124
My brother has arrived from America.

143
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,207
Else would've taken
you out for dinner.

144
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,707
What was he saying? What's this?

145
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,665
He's given me this gift.
What should we do with this now?

146
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,999
What can we do to such ruffians?

147
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,624
I feel like strangulating him!

148
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:29,457
Despite having a
child he acts so filthy.

149
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,707
Brother, how is Anoop?

150
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,165
As usual.

151
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,457
And how about Vishram?

152
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,332
He's joined Rathod's party.
- Madan Rathod?

153
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,582
Who else? That same..

154
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,332
Why?

155
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,749
Baba chucked him out here.

156
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,249
Should I feed him then? - But that
Vishram turned out to be a sly guy.

157
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,915
Got kicked here on the rear..

158
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,332
..and landed straight to
the legislative assembly.

159
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,249
Bloody bastard!

160
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:15,999
Vishnu, how many times
have I asked you to..'

161
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,124
..keep your filthy tongue in
check in front ofthe kid?

162
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,874
Eat it.
- l'm talking to you.

163
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,249
In what language would
you like me to explain?

164
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,624
Does anything go into
that thick head ofyours?

165
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,207
Why did you go to that
builders place at Worli?

166
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,624
He was acting smart, which made me
go there. - With whose permission?

167
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,082
Am I supposed to take your
permission for everything?

168
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,290
Are you responsible enough
to handle work on your own?

169
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,249
You please finish yourfood first.

170
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,540
Child, have another serving
- No.

171
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,999
Have some.
- l said no mother.

172
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,790
What are you getting angry at me?

173
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,915
You have become so stubborn!

174
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,624
Have your food, please.

175
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:18,499
Can I call you back? Thanks. Bye.

176
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:33,290
Sarkar, Silver Mani had called.
Wants to meet you tomorrow.

177
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,040
O god!

178
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,540
Hi Pistol! How are you?
- Fine.

179
00:17:56,083 --> 00:18:02,040
Hey baldy! There are hair oils
galore in the market. Try them.

180
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,124
Greetings, Khan sir.

181
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,374
I explained to Surendra..

182
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,582
..in lighter matters you would
find Silver Mani acting comic.

183
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,249
But in serious
matters it's only murder!

184
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:20,290
The game ends! And so
does the story! That's it!

185
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,624
Chicku, dear

186
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:28,874
No tea! No coffee! No cold drinks!
I'll have food here.

187
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,749
You're embarrassing me, Mani sir!

188
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,999
What sir? You are the lord, Sarkar!

189
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,749
Shankar!

190
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,040
You must have met my son.

191
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,207
How could l? He aIways stays abroad.

192
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,165
I'm Silver Mani!
StyIe from the South

193
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,457
Operations, completely North!

194
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,790
Tell me, Mani, what brings you here?

195
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,040
Those union guys had come to me.

196
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:10,582
Telecom project! To ask for
bonded labor from Hyderabad.

197
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,415
I had warned them.

198
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,957
I know, Sarkar. But I
thought honesty isn't..

199
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,165
..the best policy
in today's politics.

200
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,915
We'll suffer losses!

201
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:28,124
Mani, how many times have
l explained this earlier..

202
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,540
..that while counting
the short term gains..

203
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,790
..one shouldn't lose sight
ofthe long term damages.

204
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,499
What did I say?

205
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,207
I said the same thing, sir!

206
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,249
Let it go. We'll
bear the humiliation.

207
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,790
And what? I repeatedly
tell this to everyone.

208
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,790
My style is South but
operations are completeIy North!

209
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,165
I've learnt this from you.

210
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,749
One minute. Sarkar,
there's something more.

211
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,749
Call that boy.

212
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,624
This boy Mahesh he
is an excellent actor.

213
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:22,124
You know so many film folks.
Get him some work.

214
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,665
I don't interfere in others' work.

215
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,915
Don't you know?

216
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,999
What did I say? l
said the same thing.

217
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,749
Talk to Vishnu! He might
have something for you.

218
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,749
Going again?
- What else should I do?

219
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,540
Staying back wilI mean hearing
that old man's nonsense again.

220
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,540
He is your father!

221
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,499
Stop favoring him! It's me
who had brought you here.

222
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,707
Dare not forget it!

223
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,499
Yes, Vishram!

224
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,249
C'mon, bark!

225
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,249
Vishnu, why are you
talking like this to me?

226
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,374
You know I have a problem
with Sarkar and not with you.

227
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,832
You have always been my
friend and will remain so.

228
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,915
Ok, now! Stop this drama.
How's your work going?

229
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,374
I make double the
amount with halfthe work.

230
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,957
What type of a man is this Rathod?

231
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,415
He's a complete idiot and that makes
working with him all the more fun.

232
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,707
We've been taking him for a ride
and he doesn't even realize it.

233
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,915
How's your film doing?

234
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:56,124
Great! Will be a block-buster!

235
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:59,290
You think that hero
ofyours will work?

236
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,249
And that heroine?

237
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,665
Any progress with her?

238
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,624
Hey.

239
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,707
How's your brother?

240
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,374
Returned after having a nice
time in America. What else?

241
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,165
Heard of him having an
affair with that Modi's daughter?

242
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,499
What are you saying?

243
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,332
The whole world knows of it.

244
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,624
Really.

245
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,665
And what about that girl?

246
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,957
Avanti?
- Who Avanti?

247
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,915
Sawant's daughter!
He is father's friend.

248
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,957
He had promised him on his deathbed

249
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,415
that Shankar will be
married to Avanti.

250
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:12,165
His mother and daughter are at home.

251
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,582
Poor Sarkar!

252
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:29,040
What will Sarkar do?

253
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,332
What can we do in such matters?

254
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,082
Pushpa.

255
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,749
I had given my word to Sawant that..

256
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:56,957
Anyway..

257
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,290
What about Avanti, then?

258
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,957
I'll talk to her.

259
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,832
Where's Shankar?

260
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:15,582
Shankar, ifyou don't mind,
Can I ask you a question?

261
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:22,707
Yes.
- What does your dad exactly do?

262
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,707
What do you mean by that?

263
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,499
He helps people.

264
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,374
Helps? Meaning?

265
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:37,332
HeIp means if someone
comes to him with a problem..

266
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,957
..he makes it his own problem.

267
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,624
Shankar, whenever I see
his photograph in some..

268
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,249
newspaper or magazine..

269
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,957
..there are always gunmen
standing beside him. Why?

270
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:51,540
Security.

271
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:55,249
Security? But why
wouId he have enemies?

272
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:01,332
Pooja, when one takes a
stand he's bound to convert

273
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,957
the other person into his enemy.

274
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,957
But Shankar, who is
your father, after all..

275
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:08,915
..to fight on behalf of others?

276
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,707
One doesn't need an appointment
letter to impartjustice.

277
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:22,207
You mean your dad thinks he's
above the police and the law?

278
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,540
He doesn't think so. Millions
of his admirers think that way.

279
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,957
You know, my dad doesn't
think highly of your dad.

280
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,374
Same here! My dad too doesn't
hold your dad in high esteem.

281
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:41,957
What do you mean? How can you
even make such a comparison?

282
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,790
My dad is a legitimate businessman.

283
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:47,415
The only difference between
your dad and mine is that..

284
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:52,874
..your dad stays within the system
and works for his own profits..

285
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,249
..while my dad stays out ofthe
system to work for others' benefit.

286
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:04,249
You mean to say that your
dad is a parallel government?

287
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,540
Ifthe meaning of the government
is to take care of people..

288
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:09,207
..then he definitely is.

289
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:19,499
Look Pooja, he's my dad.

290
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,832
I know him.

291
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,957
Whatever he does
is for others' good.

292
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,957
His ways are different but..

293
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,790
..neither is he a criminal..

294
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,082
..nor does he have
connections with criminals.

295
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,499
Okay?

296
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,207
Okay.

297
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:51,499
Rasheed wants to meet you.

298
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,457
Who Rasheed?

299
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:57,707
He belonged to the
Nayak gang earlier.

300
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,915
Was involved in a couple
of murders.

301
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,582
He was in Bangkok and NepaI
for the past couple ofyears.

302
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,374
Don't know what he wants from you.

303
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,165
Call him.

304
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:14,082
Ask Mr. Preetam to
come and meet me.

305
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,999
Wanted to talk to you alone.

306
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,790
Consider that I'm alone.

307
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,040
My goods are expected to arrive

308
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:51,165
by ship in Shikuti village.

309
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:56,832
And will continue to
arrive for at least two years.

310
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:05,374
It's well known that nothing happens
in this area without your consent.

311
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:13,999
So, we just wanted to
seek your blessings.

312
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:22,499
You'll get a couple of
millions on each consignment.

313
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:29,665
2 miIlion before the delivery.

314
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,999
Look Rasheed

315
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:42,124
I don't know what
you've heard about me.

316
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:50,665
l do agree that there are
certain things that l do..

317
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:55,374
..that can't be considered lawful.

318
00:29:56,583 --> 00:30:01,165
That's because I do
what I think is right.

319
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:08,582
It may go against god, the society..

320
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,249
..the police, law or the
entire system for that matter.

321
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:23,999
Different people hold
different views about my work..

322
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,957
..and they form an opinion about me.

323
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,874
I will not do it.

324
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,749
3 million?
- You think we are on sale?

325
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,915
You know whom you are talking to?

326
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:45,999
I mean..
- Don't even try to explain.

327
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,332
Rasheed.

328
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:52,082
I know what those goods are
and the reason for their arrival.

329
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:56,082
I will not do it.

330
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:34,749
And listen, l will not
let you do it either.

331
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,957
Khan sir..

332
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:25,207
..whatever there is
worth knowing about this man,

333
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:29,582
I want to know all that.

334
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:33,874
Send a word to Savatya
to come and meet me.

335
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:45,040
Your mother was saying that
you wanted to go back to America.

336
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:48,749
Yes. A friend and I are planning
to start a software company.

337
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:53,082
Pooja is your friend's name, right?

338
00:32:57,958 --> 00:32:59,665
When are you introducing us to her?

339
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,332
Whenever you have the time.

340
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:15,540
Savatya this Rasheed..

341
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:26,207
I'm not happy with his ways.

342
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:41,665
What? You'll kill
Subhash Nagre? Will you?

343
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,332
Vishram,  just
listen to what he says!

344
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:48,874
I haven't come all the way
from Dubai to tell ajoke.

345
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,124
Rasheed, the whole of
Mumbai will burn in flames.

346
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:56,457
I'm not bothered about Mumbai.

347
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,999
One doesn't get business
worth 1,000 million everyday.

348
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,249
We'Il have to grab it.

349
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:08,749
Even ifthat means killing
Sarkar or anyone for that matter.

350
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:13,124
Vishram, explain to him.

351
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,457
He has arrived from Dubai
and doesn't know how things..

352
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:16,874
..are in Mumbai.

353
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:19,874
Make him understand! Explain.

354
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,332
Have you locked your brains?

355
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,624
Can't you understand?

356
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,082
Ok! Ifyou guys want to commit
this stupidity, sure, go ahead.

357
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:49,415
lfyou want to jump in
the well, go ahead as well.

358
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:53,832
But I'm not a part of all this.

359
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,207
I'm leaving.

360
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,249
I can't let this go out.

361
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,332
Rasheed, I give you a guarantee.
My lips will remain seaIed.

362
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:16,749
I take an oath on my children,
Rasheed.

363
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,707
You were right. I was
talking like a madman.

364
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:23,915
I couldn't understand really.
He should be bumped off.

365
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:47,790
A decision should be
made with choice..

366
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:51,874
..and not under duress.

367
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:58,374
Rasheed, we have Swami's message.

368
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:01,374
He wants to meet you.

369
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:23,749
Killing Subhash Nagre and killing
Sarkar are two different things.

370
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:30,915
Subhash Nagre is
a mere human being.

371
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:36,915
Sarkar is a thought, a philosophy.

372
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:42,457
Before killing the man

373
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:53,624
it is imperative to
kill his philosophy.

374
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,582
I didn't understand, Swami.

375
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:06,457
I will expIain.

376
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:46,957
Swami's thinking is great!

377
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:49,832
I haven't seen a more
intelligent person than him.

378
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,415
Who is this Savatya?

379
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:55,374
He was enquiring about me.

380
00:37:55,375 --> 00:38:00,040
He's one ofthe closest aides of
Sarkar. Never take him lightly.

381
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:02,749
He can prove to be a step
ahead of us in these matters.

382
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,499
Cheat!
- What have I done?

383
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,665
First you cheat and to
top it you lie. Why?

384
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,874
Why would anyone cheat? To win!

385
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,915
Is winning so absolutely necessary?

386
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,665
Yes.

387
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:29,582
What ifyou have to lose someday?

388
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:32,707
Impossible.

389
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:35,415
I don't mean the game. I mean life.

390
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:39,207
With Sarkar on my side,
how can I lose to anyone?

391
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:10,499
Welcome!

392
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,790
Welcome, Mr. Rathod!

393
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:22,624
Wait a minute. Get aside.

394
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:27,624
Shankar, how are you?
- Fine.

395
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,874
Hi!

396
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:34,665
Mr. Rathod, she is Pooja.
- Greetings.

397
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,124
Greetings, Mr. Khurana!
What an honor. Welcome.

398
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:40,874
Please come. Get aside.

399
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:44,832
Mr. Khurana, your
work couldn't be done.

400
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:49,915
Changing Subhash's
mind is almost impossible.

401
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:57,374
I feel even Subhash's view
point is not totally wrong.

402
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:02,624
Violence isn't a
solution to any problem.

403
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:10,374
A person who carries
his whims out by force

404
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:16,290
can prove to be
dangerous for the society.

405
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,499
Why should I fear?

406
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:26,582
This is the truth that ruffians
are being nurtured under the cover

407
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,332
of creating
housing for the deprived.

408
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:34,790
And there is only one
person encouraging this.

409
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,290
Subhash Nagre.

410
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:42,082
Mr. Khurana's thinks at your level.

411
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:53,915
The public doesn't know
the reaI Subhash Nagre.

412
00:40:54,708 --> 00:41:01,582
Hence it reveres him.
Thinks he's a messiah.

413
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:07,665
But according to me
he is just a hooligan.

414
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:15,290
According to me, in a democracy..

415
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:17,415
Even the pubIic support
for him is on the rise.

416
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:19,624
Jumping too much!

417
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:22,040
One tight smack will
set everything right.

418
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:24,999
Sarkar, this man used to
know his limits previously.

419
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,040
But now, he's openly giving
interviews in the press..

420
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:28,540
..television, everywhere.

421
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:34,999
Pushpa, get some pickle, please.

422
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:52,082
Mr. Khurana

423
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:57,415
is a very nice man.

424
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,790
For a person like him..

425
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:10,832
Hail Khurana!

426
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:13,957
It is very important
to live in this world.

427
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:53,124
'Motilal Khurana's murder has
caused a sensation in the city.'

428
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:55,457
'The only question
doing the rounds is'

429
00:44:55,791 --> 00:45:00,040
'who can get a non-violent and
popular figure like him killed? '

430
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:02,957
'And now the weather update.'

431
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:07,040
Any news about this?

432
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,874
Everyone thinks you got him kilIed.

433
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:21,332
Mama, my ice cream.
- Chicku, quiet.

434
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,374
Do you also think
that I got him killed?

435
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,874
No.

436
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,499
I'm not the only one.
Everyone is saying this.

437
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:53,707
Who everyone?
- The entire city.

438
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:57,374
Ask anyone and they say it
is your dad's handiwork.

439
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,374
A lie can't be made a truth just
because everyone is saying it.

440
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:06,415
Just the way, without knowing
the facts, you've taken a decision

441
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:10,124
in the like manner everyone thinks
that this is my dad's handiwork.

442
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:13,124
Must be something,
otherwise how can..

443
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:15,582
Just stop it, Pooja! Enough!

444
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:36,957
Do you trust me?

445
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:43,582
You cannot refuse the
fact that I know my dad..

446
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,040
..better than anyone
else for that matter.

447
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:53,415
If not him, trust me, at least.

448
00:46:56,583 --> 00:47:01,374
Suspecting him would mean
your casting aspersions over me.

449
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:11,374
Congrats!
- For what?

450
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:16,374
I heard about Pooja and you.

451
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,332
Shankar, you know that
I love you, don't you?

452
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:25,707
Yes.

453
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:27,999
Since childhood.

454
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,915
My mistake. I
thought even you would..

455
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:42,790
That's fine. I'm sure
she's very beautiful.

456
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:55,915
Avantika..
- ReIax, Shankar.

457
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:58,165
I've spent the night crying.

458
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:01,749
And now it doesn't bother me.

459
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:04,374
Really.

460
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,332
Really, l swear.

461
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:19,124
So, when are you
both getting married?

462
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:23,665
Thinking of marrying her.

463
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:25,957
Whom?

464
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:28,082
The heroine of that movie?

465
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,082
Where is Vishnu now?

466
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,999
Don't beat around the bush.
Tell me, what happened?

467
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:36,707
Your film people are
mocking at you.

468
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:40,457
Except you, everyone
knows what is cooking between

469
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:42,374
the heroine and the
hero ofthe movie.

470
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,957
Stay in your limits or
else I will bump you off!

471
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,415
You wiIl kill me?

472
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:52,624
I'm being your well wisher and
you're thinking of bumping me off?

473
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:55,540
One shouldn't do
good deeds these days!

474
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:59,707
Look Vishnu, I have the video
tape shot in the make up van..

475
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:02,915
..which features the hero and
heroine in compromising poses.

476
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:05,040
I'm sending that to you.

477
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:09,165
Witness them and their
comments about you, for yourself.

478
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:12,415
I know everything about Vishnu.

479
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:16,374
Your work will be done, Swami.

480
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:19,582
200 percent.

481
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:31,624
Hi!

482
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:20,790
Doesn't matter how many
people would've been there.

483
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:23,957
Because everyone
knows he is Sarkar's son.

484
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:28,207
Nobody wilI testify against him.
Even the heroine was scared of him.

485
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:32,457
I don't know what sin
Subhash has committed..

486
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,582
..that he got such a son.

487
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:39,540
Sir, he is his father
even in hooliganism.

488
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:44,957
Yes, l know that you'll
not believe me. l'm sure.

489
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:47,624
Sarkar has had Khurana murdered.

490
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,249
No!

491
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:54,999
I've told you many times, you
all don't understand Subhash.

492
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,124
Forget about his son.

493
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,707
But Subhash isn't like this.

494
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:02,374
When something doesn't happen
as you wish, you do this too.

495
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:08,999
I..
- l know. You givejustice.

496
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,415
You've got a good reason.

497
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:13,040
Do whatever you want
in the name of justice.

498
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:15,832
If I do that, it's injustice.

499
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:19,415
Brother, you speak with respect.
You're speaking to Sarkar.

500
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:20,957
And who are you to
meddle in our affairs?

501
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:22,749
Vishnu.
- Chandar.

502
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,665
Why don't you accept that
you committed a mistake?

503
00:52:25,666 --> 00:52:27,165
What mistake, mother?

504
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:30,082
I made that kid and
behind my back..

505
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:34,957
You told me to use power if I
have it. I did precisely that.

506
00:52:35,291 --> 00:52:37,957
You'll never understand
what power is, Vishnu.

507
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:41,999
Power is gained by uniting people.

508
00:52:43,416 --> 00:52:45,124
Not by dividing them.

509
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:49,665
Give this lecture to the people,
whom you've been fooling.

510
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,332
It will not work with me.

511
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:55,290
You're crossing your limits,
Vishnu. - What did I tell you?

512
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:58,749
Ifyou speak again, I'll kill you.

513
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:06,332
Motherwhy..

514
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:09,415
You don't know this Chandar. He
engineers so many scams in work.

515
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:12,207
I know the people who work here.

516
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:15,457
There he'll praise
his servants now.

517
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:19,374
You.. I actually respect you.

518
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:21,915
You think different from
the world. Just different.

519
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:25,040
If someone brings
in profit of millions..

520
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:26,082
..you'll drive him away. Why?

521
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:29,290
Because we'Il be profited.
You cannot digest that.

522
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:31,582
You cannot do business, and
won't let us do business either.

523
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,290
Vishnu, why are you making
a mountain of a mole hill?

524
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:38,082
Sarkarjust asked you,
why did you kill that man?

525
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:40,790
Can l ask you, Khan, why did
your Sarkar kill that Khurana?

526
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,207
Brother, be careful.

527
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:46,749
You keep quiet. You don't know
anything. You were there, abroad.

528
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:49,540
What do you think?
Your father is a saint?

529
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:53,082
You don't know your father.

530
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:02,332
Vishnu.

531
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:10,540
Right now go away from this house.

532
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:20,332
From today, don't make the mistake
of being seen around this house.

533
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:25,665
Go, get lost.

534
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,540
Amrita. - Amrita and
Chicku will not go anywhere.

535
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,540
Sapna. Subhash Nagre
is coming to meet you.

536
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:02,957
What did you do?

537
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:07,249
Are you crazy?

538
00:56:07,791 --> 00:56:09,665
It is my mistake.

539
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,415
I should have known
what a hot head you are.

540
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:16,957
You can do anything.

541
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:22,124
It would have been better
if I didn't send you the CD.

542
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,915
That kid.

543
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:43,790
Till date l

544
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:54,082
never hurt any innocent person.

545
00:56:56,291 --> 00:57:00,582
And I've never
forgiven anyone who did that.

546
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:07,624
Whoever he is.

547
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:15,332
I have come to tell you today.

548
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:18,249
You don't have to fear anyone.

549
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:27,124
It's my responsibility
to look after your safety.

550
00:57:46,916 --> 00:57:50,749
Govinda!

551
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,207
She has given a statement against
you with your father's support.

552
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,832
And a warrant is out against you.

553
00:58:12,416 --> 00:58:17,374
The police can come here anytime.
You don't worry.

554
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:22,874
I'll arrange for you to hide.

555
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:39,499
Sarkar, Khurana's
killer has been apprehended.

556
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,582
Who is he?

557
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:44,874
His name is Ansari.

558
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:48,749
Whom does he work for?

559
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:57,624
I don't know. He testified that
you ordered him to kill Khurana.

560
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:04,457
And the home department has
taken out a warrant against you.

561
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:18,749
TelI me, madam.

562
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,290
Everyone was right about you.

563
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:24,874
I was a fool that I
didn't recognize you.

564
00:59:25,291 --> 00:59:29,165
Subhash, enough ofyour drama.

565
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:32,749
I'll see how you get away now.

566
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:58,540
Subhash Nagre has been accused
of being behind Khurana's death.

567
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:00,540
With this, not only
Khurana's supporters,

568
01:00:00,541 --> 01:00:03,124
even Nagre's supporters
are stunned.

569
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:09,457
They never thought that
Nagre would stoop so low

570
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:11,999
in an attempt to show his power.

571
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:15,415
The commissioner
S P Pathak has said

572
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:18,582
that this is the beginning of
the end of Nagre's hooliganism.

573
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,832
He is coming.

574
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:12,415
Stop!

575
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:19,415
There's a very big conspiracy.

576
01:04:22,541 --> 01:04:25,499
This is the beginning.

577
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:31,707
I committed the mistake.

578
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:34,832
It is my mistake.

579
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:37,957
I couldn't see this coming.

580
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:45,249
I don't want you to meddle in this.

581
01:04:46,291 --> 01:04:49,249
So go back to America
as soon as possible.

582
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,999
No, dad.

583
01:05:06,291 --> 01:05:09,332
Don't worry about me. I
can take care of myself.

584
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:12,332
But you know nothing about this
and you're not involved in this.

585
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:16,957
Go back to America right now. Go.

586
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:19,957
Don't worry about me, dad.

587
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:25,457
I can take care of myself too.

588
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,374
Yes, I know that l don't
know much about all this.

589
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:39,165
But I have some
responsibilities too.

590
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,749
Chandar maybe you were right.
Rasheed is behind this.

591
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:39,707
But Sarkar gave Rasheed's work
to Savatya. What about that?

592
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,082
I called him a couple oftimes,
he didn't take the call.

593
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:46,415
I will go and check.

594
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,457
Savatya

595
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,707
We'll kill that
Ansari in the lock up.

596
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:02,999
It'll be stupidity.

597
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,457
What stupidity? Are we cowards?

598
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:07,332
Don't shout!

599
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:13,957
You aren't the only
one who's worrying.

600
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:25,540
Even ifwe touch Ansari, this fake
case against dad will turn true.

601
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:28,915
You are right.

602
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:34,915
Shankar.

603
01:08:51,416 --> 01:08:56,749
I didn't come here to argue,
or hear your explanation.

604
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:07,707
Whatever is going on,
I cannot tolerate it.

605
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:22,249
Shankar, I love you. l
have fulI faith in you.

606
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,040
But I don't believe your family.

607
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:37,457
I'm going back to America.

608
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:44,749
All I wanted to know is
wilI you come with me?

609
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:58,957
Pooja.. - Shankar, I
just want to hear from you.

610
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:12,999
No.

611
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:45,165
Shankar.

612
01:10:45,166 --> 01:10:48,832
We got the news. Rasheed will
have Sarkar attacked in the prison.

613
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,624
Who are you?

614
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:08,790
I'm Subhash Nagre's son, sir.
- So?

615
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:11,124
Dad is about to be attacked.

616
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:17,290
Your father is in prison. Where
else will he get better security?

617
01:11:17,291 --> 01:11:19,624
Sir, even you know
what happens in ourjails.

618
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:22,957
My dad's life is in danger. I want
you to take some action quickly.

619
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,207
You're ordering me?

620
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:34,582
Son, one doesn't do that. Because
this isn't your father's court.

621
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:39,624
I didn't mean to say that, sir.
- Forget it.

622
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:42,665
Let him die if he has to.

623
01:11:45,458 --> 01:11:50,624
Actually, he'll reap
whatever he has sown till now..

624
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,749
Sir, why are you talking like this?

625
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:58,957
Ifyou speak a lot

626
01:11:59,208 --> 01:12:02,915
l'll wrench your tongue
out and give it in your hand!

627
01:12:08,666 --> 01:12:10,290
Yes.

628
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:15,290
How much did you get?

629
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,415
What did you say?

630
01:12:24,916 --> 01:12:26,957
How much did you get?

631
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:36,999
Go tell your father
that I did this.

632
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:39,749
Get lost.

633
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:45,999
So, I was telling you..

634
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:50,957
Got it?

635
01:12:51,416 --> 01:12:53,540
Now whatever has to be done..

636
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:04,707
Shankar onIy one man can
help us in this situation.

637
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:08,832
Silver Mani.

638
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:27,040
After dad's arrest, all our
contacts are afraid to help us.

639
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:30,499
I don't even know
who is helping them.

640
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:35,207
We just got the tip that Rasheed
wilI have dad attacked in prison.

641
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:36,999
You have to do something, please.

642
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,374
But son, what can I do?

643
01:13:46,666 --> 01:13:48,040
Rasheed.

644
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:53,207
What can l do?

645
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:56,207
Your father has gone crazy.

646
01:13:56,208 --> 01:13:59,540
He isn't earning, and
nor is he letting us earn.

647
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:04,290
He has ruined us for the
betterment ofthe people!

648
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,790
I swear to God.

649
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:14,749
lt's true that I
succeeded due to your father.

650
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,999
But even I have
some responsibilities.

651
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,707
Even I have to serve the public.

652
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:23,915
I have my business,
my family problems.

653
01:14:25,041 --> 01:14:28,290
And what choice do I have?

654
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:29,957
TelI me.

655
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:35,124
I told these people, you're
a kid, you can't do anything.

656
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:37,665
But these people don't
want to take any chances.

657
01:14:37,916 --> 01:14:40,249
They don't want anyone
to try to take revenge.

658
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,082
You're a sweet boy.

659
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:48,915
You're not guilty for all this.

660
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:50,874
But you're trapped.

661
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:56,415
Bad luck. Not yours, mine.

662
01:14:56,958 --> 01:15:00,165
I feeI very sad.

663
01:15:01,916 --> 01:15:04,165
God bless you.

664
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:07,749
Okay? Point made.

665
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,790
Where will you kill
these people, Rasheed?

666
01:15:10,666 --> 01:15:13,707
Please don't kill them here.
Take them out.

667
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,040
I can't see all this.

668
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,707
Rasheed, help me once more.

669
01:15:22,708 --> 01:15:26,290
For me and Sarkar's friendship.

670
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:30,040
Clean bowl him.

671
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:33,499
Either the heart or
the brain, directly.

672
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,957
Remember.

673
01:15:35,208 --> 01:15:37,332
Don't let him bleed more.

674
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:42,082
I have to make such a
concession for Sarkar.

675
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:38,832
Gundas.

676
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:43,040
Shoot.

677
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:45,540
Run, Shankar.

678
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:48,165
Run quickly Shankar!

679
01:16:54,416 --> 01:16:57,207
Govinda!

680
01:17:16,375 --> 01:17:18,874
Govinda!
- Come fast!

681
01:17:23,041 --> 01:17:24,582
Get aside!

682
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:51,457
Govinda!

683
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:57,540
Get aside!

684
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:06,707
Come on!

685
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,707
Yes, tell me, Shankar.

686
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:22,249
See, Subhash Nagre
will be attacked.

687
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:25,415
How do you know? - There's no
time for any questions. Quickly.

688
01:20:35,708 --> 01:20:39,040
Dad!

689
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:42,790
Get an ambulance!

690
01:20:44,916 --> 01:20:46,249
Call a doctor!

691
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:13,915
We'Il not leave that south Indian!

692
01:22:14,791 --> 01:22:17,749
We'll shoot him today itself. -
Arrange for the security here first.

693
01:22:20,541 --> 01:22:22,249
I had told you.

694
01:22:22,458 --> 01:22:24,374
Sanyasi would've
brought the shooter.

695
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:27,790
He would've aimed at the brain.

696
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:30,415
Just one bulIet.

697
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:33,915
One bullet. He
wouId've aimed at the brain.

698
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:35,999
And Sarkar's
chapter would be closed.

699
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,165
What did you say?

700
01:22:37,166 --> 01:22:39,374
That he was a shooter from Dubai.
Very experienced.

701
01:22:39,583 --> 01:22:41,624
Olympic gold medaIist!

702
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,124
Don't stare at me.

703
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:49,082
I'll gouge your eyes out! lt's
about Sarkar, it's not child's play.

704
01:22:50,291 --> 01:22:51,457
Mr. Mani..

705
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:52,624
Hey!

706
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:54,374
This is about life and death.

707
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:56,499
What did you think? He's Sarkar.

708
01:22:56,791 --> 01:22:59,540
He brought an L board
and aimed at Sarkar.

709
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:03,165
Don't touch him. Ifyou touch him,
he will go. Or we wiIl.

710
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:06,374
Is it child's play?
Don't stare at me!

711
01:23:06,958 --> 01:23:08,499
Mani sir, forget what happened.
- Don't interfere.

712
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,832
Now, think about the future.

713
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:11,790
What will happen further?
What do you know?

714
01:23:11,791 --> 01:23:12,957
Shut up!
- Listen to me.

715
01:23:13,333 --> 01:23:15,790
I'm being respectable to you.
You speak with me politely too!

716
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:18,582
What respect? They'll chase me now.
- Mind your tongue!

717
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:21,957
You're just blabbering away!
- You don't stare at me!

718
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:23,332
Silence, it is too much now!
- You shut up!

719
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:24,874
It's enough! You talk too much!

720
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,415
Hey!
- Come with me.

721
01:23:32,916 --> 01:23:34,124
Dog!

722
01:23:41,541 --> 01:23:42,915
One minute.

723
01:23:44,416 --> 01:23:47,957
Sir.
- See, we're holding an enquiry.

724
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:50,207
Please be quiet.

725
01:23:50,416 --> 01:23:51,624
One person at a time.

726
01:23:51,875 --> 01:23:53,415
See, this isn't done.

727
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:55,540
One person at a time.

728
01:23:57,125 --> 01:23:58,457
TelI me.

729
01:24:01,916 --> 01:24:02,957
When?

730
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,874
We have come to know about Vishnu.

731
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:12,540
He's hiding at
Vishram Bhagat's place.

732
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:25,124
Shankar.

733
01:24:26,333 --> 01:24:27,790
Dad is calling you.

734
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,874
Sarvar Mani.

735
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:01,499
Rasheed.

736
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:03,999
Vishram Bhagat.

737
01:25:11,208 --> 01:25:13,290
And we got the news right now that..

738
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:18,790
..brother is with him.

739
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,457
What mistake did we commit?

740
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:04,415
We taught the whole world.

741
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:10,957
Only our son..

742
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:33,540
They'll use him and then throw him.

743
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:42,124
They'lI throw him out
when theirwork is done.

744
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,665
Juice.

745
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,874
Mr. Vishram. Sarkar has got bail.

746
01:27:35,916 --> 01:27:41,582
And secondly, he knows
that you've done all this.

747
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:54,165
The police have
confirmed that the person

748
01:27:54,166 --> 01:27:57,457
who attacked Subhash Nagre,
wasn't Khurana's man.

749
01:27:57,875 --> 01:28:00,332
This also has raised questions

750
01:28:00,333 --> 01:28:04,290
whether a third party is
responsible for Khurana's death.

751
01:28:04,625 --> 01:28:08,082
The public is wondering whether
this is a political conspiracy to..

752
01:28:08,083 --> 01:28:13,874
..take advantage of the
Nagre Khurana personal enmity.

753
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:47,415
Hey!

754
01:28:47,416 --> 01:28:48,790
My child!

755
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:04,124
Come.

756
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:20,832
Thanks.

757
01:29:22,041 --> 01:29:23,832
For what?

758
01:29:25,625 --> 01:29:28,040
The way you looked after dad.

759
01:29:33,375 --> 01:29:35,790
I know that..

760
01:29:36,833 --> 01:29:42,999
..you didn't think
about me in that way.

761
01:29:46,916 --> 01:29:48,540
And..

762
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:58,457
I..

763
01:30:05,875 --> 01:30:08,540
I want to know..

764
01:30:12,833 --> 01:30:28,124
Whether you..

765
01:31:32,125 --> 01:31:34,540
Very good, Shankar.

766
01:31:34,916 --> 01:31:36,582
This is great.

767
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,290
I've sacked that commissioner.

768
01:31:40,041 --> 01:31:41,332
Subhash.

769
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:44,874
If possible, please forgive me.

770
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:49,499
Even I was fooled like everyone.

771
01:31:51,208 --> 01:31:54,457
Thank you, sister-in-law, thank you.

772
01:31:58,125 --> 01:31:59,957
What do you think?

773
01:32:00,333 --> 01:32:02,082
Who are behind this?

774
01:32:03,375 --> 01:32:05,415
All of us are finished now.

775
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:08,957
Sarkar has found out about us.

776
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,707
We'll die one by one now.

777
01:32:14,083 --> 01:32:16,582
He'll not spare any of us.

778
01:32:17,541 --> 01:32:19,540
I know him.

779
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:23,874
I'm going to Tamil Nadu.

780
01:32:24,916 --> 01:32:27,915
Whichever villages are
left after the tsunami,

781
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:33,082
I'll settle in any one ofthem.

782
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:35,999
You go to Dubai.

783
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,082
No, Sarkar has got contacts there.

784
01:32:39,583 --> 01:32:42,249
I've an idea. There
is sand over there.

785
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:44,874
Dig in and hide.

786
01:32:45,625 --> 01:32:47,332
You are finished.

787
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:50,040
Vishram. Even ifyou die,
Sarkar will give you life again..

788
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:52,874
..just to kill you.

789
01:32:55,958 --> 01:32:57,749
Swami.

790
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,332
You're safe.

791
01:32:59,791 --> 01:33:06,290
Sing 'Hail Rama Hail Krishna'
and some devotional songs loudly.

792
01:33:06,541 --> 01:33:08,624
There will be a meeting very soon.

793
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:15,999
The greatest mistake of my life!
I listened to you!

794
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,790
Why are you talking so much?

795
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:21,290
We'Il go to his house and kill him.

796
01:33:23,166 --> 01:33:24,957
You'll go to
Sarkar's house and kill him?

797
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:27,790
His house isn't a house,
it's a fort.

798
01:33:28,291 --> 01:33:31,124
There's a whole army inside.
And there's security outside.

799
01:33:32,166 --> 01:33:34,290
There's no way out.

800
01:33:34,583 --> 01:33:36,665
There's no other way out.

801
01:33:37,833 --> 01:33:39,749
There is.

802
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:46,665
Son. Don't commit a mistake just
for the sake ofthis material body.

803
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:53,040
The body is just a
case for the soul.

804
01:33:53,958 --> 01:33:56,957
Understand this.

805
01:33:57,333 --> 01:34:00,374
You're not killing your father.

806
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:04,790
You're killing his body.

807
01:34:05,125 --> 01:34:08,665
Yes.
- As it is, Vishnu.

808
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:11,749
How long will your
father stay alive now?

809
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:13,999
10 years? 15 years.

810
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,207
This will happen then.

811
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:19,582
Till the time
Subhash Nagre is alive,

812
01:34:21,208 --> 01:34:26,040
Vishnu Nagre wilI be a pauper.

813
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:29,915
Really. He hasn't let him
be his own man all his life.

814
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:32,124
See, Vishnu.

815
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:35,499
You know that we've done
more than your father for you.

816
01:34:36,333 --> 01:34:38,165
Ifwe weren't there yesterday..

817
01:34:38,416 --> 01:34:40,374
..you'd be in prison by now.

818
01:34:40,666 --> 01:34:41,915
You know that, isn't it?

819
01:34:42,541 --> 01:34:48,124
Arjun had killed his relatives too.

820
01:34:48,708 --> 01:34:53,957
Vishnu. Nothing is right or wrong.

821
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,749
Sarkar says it, doesn't he?

822
01:34:57,125 --> 01:35:01,165
The one who has power, is
right even if he's wrong.

823
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:45,124
I have to meet Shankar.

824
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:51,957
They were planning to kill dad.

825
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:58,374
They told me to do that.

826
01:36:04,375 --> 01:36:06,040
I'm dad's bad son, isn't it?

827
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,832
But I'm his son.

828
01:36:21,791 --> 01:36:24,040
I'm sorry, mother.

829
01:36:34,833 --> 01:36:35,957
Mother.

830
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:46,624
Shankar.

831
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,582
He wants to apologize to you.

832
01:37:20,958 --> 01:37:23,665
He's repenting for his actions.

833
01:37:27,833 --> 01:37:29,957
Everyone commits a mistake.

834
01:37:35,458 --> 01:37:37,915
He'll never do anything Iike this.

835
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,540
He has learnt his lesson.

836
01:37:48,958 --> 01:37:50,749
Why didn't he come?

837
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:53,832
He cannot face you.

838
01:37:58,125 --> 01:37:59,707
TelI me.

839
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:03,374
Shall I let him come in the house?

840
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,790
What is it?

841
01:40:46,083 --> 01:40:47,665
Shankar! Vishnu!

842
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:56,665
What were you two doing?

843
01:40:58,166 --> 01:41:01,749
Shankar stop!

844
01:41:18,333 --> 01:41:20,832
What did he do?

845
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,957
Hello.
- Vishram.

846
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:04,249
Yes, Vishnu, tell me.
- Sarkar is finished.

847
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,249
I have looked after Shankar too.

848
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:14,290
He's going back to America.

849
01:42:16,375 --> 01:42:18,249
We rule.

850
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:23,499
There's good news for you.

851
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:24,999
What?

852
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,624
Sarkar is finished.
- What?

853
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:30,415
Sarkar is finished.

854
01:42:30,416 --> 01:42:33,165
Sarkar is finished?
- Finished!

855
01:42:33,875 --> 01:42:38,374
This heart asks for more!

856
01:42:38,666 --> 01:42:42,749
Sarkar is finished.

857
01:46:15,125 --> 01:46:17,374
I've killed brother.

858
01:47:34,625 --> 01:47:36,624
Now?

859
01:48:16,291 --> 01:48:17,540
Greetings.

860
01:48:23,166 --> 01:48:24,665
Lord Muruga!

861
01:48:33,875 --> 01:48:59,082
Govinda!

862
01:50:40,791 --> 01:50:56,915
"Cheating,
enchantment, punishment, spying."

863
01:50:56,916 --> 01:50:59,707
I didn't need to
be here to kill you.

864
01:51:05,708 --> 01:51:08,957
But I wanted to
enjoy seeing you die.

865
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:16,749
"How can we live
with this injustice?"

866
01:51:18,916 --> 01:51:25,874
"We will go to the
doors of the master."

867
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:41,124
"The master doesn't forget"

868
01:51:43,666 --> 01:51:48,499
"He doesn't commit mistakes"

869
01:51:52,125 --> 01:51:59,124
"The master doesn't forget"

870
01:51:59,708 --> 01:52:05,040
"He doesn't commit mistakes"

871
01:52:28,708 --> 01:52:35,040
"How can we live
with this injustice?"

872
01:52:35,041 --> 01:52:40,499
"We will go to the
doors of the master."

873
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:46,957
"How can we live
with this injustice?"

874
01:52:47,916 --> 01:52:54,707
"The master doesn't forget"

875
01:52:55,083 --> 01:53:03,290
"He doesn't commit mistakes"

876
01:53:27,166 --> 01:53:32,624
Son. It's written in the
Bhagvad Gita.. - l'm an atheist.

877
01:53:46,625 --> 01:53:50,332
You have just one choice now.

878
01:53:55,166 --> 01:53:58,082
Either be with your god.

879
01:54:02,583 --> 01:54:04,415
Or me.

880
01:54:46,583 --> 01:54:49,540
Come, Shankar. Come.

881
01:54:51,791 --> 01:54:53,707
Have a seat.

882
01:54:54,583 --> 01:54:57,290
What was the urgency?

883
01:55:03,041 --> 01:55:04,957
Rasheed is dead.

884
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:11,749
Silver Mani and Vishram too.

885
01:55:14,416 --> 01:55:17,749
Why are you telling me all this?

886
01:55:22,125 --> 01:55:27,957
Because when someone dies,
their dear ones are informed first.

887
01:55:29,541 --> 01:55:31,332
What do you mean?

888
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:36,415
I mean I always knew that you
were hand in glove with them.

889
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:53,915
They were the bullets.

890
01:55:55,875 --> 01:55:57,832
You were the gun.

891
01:56:10,458 --> 01:56:12,832
When Sarkar was there..

892
01:56:14,375 --> 01:56:18,874
..despite being the Chief Minister
you weren't anything but a puppet.

893
01:56:21,708 --> 01:56:26,582
Your power would increase when
Sarkar's power would decrease.

894
01:56:29,541 --> 01:56:33,124
And you used Rasheed
and Vishram Bhagat.

895
01:56:37,541 --> 01:56:41,332
The man you used to
kill Sarkars thinking.

896
01:56:42,625 --> 01:56:45,999
..was used by me to
kill your thinking.

897
01:56:49,375 --> 01:56:52,540
Your underworld connections.

898
01:56:52,541 --> 01:56:54,540
Black money.

899
01:56:54,833 --> 01:56:56,749
Your foreign bank accounts.

900
01:56:57,083 --> 01:57:00,665
Narinder Swami has
spilled it all to the CBl team.

901
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:05,582
They'll be reaching here any moment.

902
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:11,124
Son, I run the government.

903
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,249
I'm the chief minister.

904
01:57:14,250 --> 01:57:16,915
Whether Swami testifies,
or anyone else,

905
01:57:16,916 --> 01:57:19,957
I'll be out ofthe
enquiry in 2 days.

906
01:57:22,583 --> 01:57:24,415
That is what I want too.

907
01:57:25,166 --> 01:57:29,957
Govinda.

908
01:58:14,916 --> 01:58:19,540
After the president asked the chief
minister Madan Rathore to resign..

909
01:58:19,541 --> 01:58:22,332
..mid term polls have
been announced in the state.

910
01:58:22,333 --> 01:58:25,665
The aspirant for the chief
minister's post is Haridas Shinde..

911
01:58:25,666 --> 01:58:29,665
..and everyone knows that
he'll win the election this time.

912
01:58:29,666 --> 01:58:32,832
Because he is
supported by Subhash Nagre.

913
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,374
The police came to our
house and took my husband away.

914
01:59:05,916 --> 01:59:11,207
They hit him so much,
they kilIed him.

915
01:59:13,583 --> 01:59:16,290
Then they threw his
dead body on the road

916
01:59:16,291 --> 01:59:19,249
and prepared a fake
report that he was a gangster.

917
01:59:20,458 --> 01:59:22,957
That he attacked the police.

918
01:59:23,833 --> 01:59:26,165
I want to have them punished.

919
01:59:26,666 --> 01:59:28,540
I want to avenge

920
01:59:29,916 --> 01:59:32,207
my husband.

921
01:59:32,541 --> 01:59:35,415
Please get justice for my husband.

922
01:59:36,291 --> 01:59:40,915
Please avenge my husband Sarkar.

923
01:59:41,541 --> 01:59:46,540
Govinda!

924
02:00:28,708 --> 02:00:35,457
"When your deeds aren't good,
what's there to think?"

925
02:00:35,458 --> 02:00:42,082
"Different forms have different
pains, that's destiny's rule."

926
02:00:42,625 --> 02:00:47,082
"This thought, this
form is infinite."

927
02:00:48,416 --> 02:00:55,082
"Whether you want it or not, it
gives, that's destiny's rule."

928
02:00:55,416 --> 02:01:10,999
"Govinda."

929
02:01:33,458 --> 02:01:42,915
"This city has many questions."
