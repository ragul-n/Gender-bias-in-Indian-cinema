22
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Did you finish or not? How much longer

23
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Throw out everyone inside

24
00:04:32,943 --> 00:04:36,943
Where shall i take this infant if you send me out when my husband's not home?

25
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:39,742
Wait till he comes

26
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
How long should I wait? Your husband wants to hog all my money

27
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:49,527
I have no ill will against you. Please wait. I'll repay

28
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:52,136
Boothayya: Not Possible

29
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:59,161
Sir, will the mother and baby survive in this winter if they're thrown out like this?

30
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let them die. It's good for the village if the poor die of hunger.

31
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Village won't be good if the poor die. It would get better if people who crave for money like bed bugs die.

32
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:13,425
Have you brought court's order to take possession of my home?

33
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,400
Boothayya: Shut your mouth. Did you bring the court's order when you came to me asking for loan?

34
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:19,475
Didn't you beg like a dog?

35
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,420
Now you talk about law? Hey Kenga, lock the house.

36
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:26,376
I'll see who is going to stop me now.

37
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:32,401
Who can stop you in this village Sir? I should slap myself with my sandals for taking loan from you.
Let's go now.

38
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:36,426
Let him carry this house and pots on his head.

39
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:39,451
Boothayya: Hey leave that too. Go now.

40
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:53,191
Devayya: Who has lived happily after taking loan from that Boothayya?
His loan grows like the shadow after noon.

41
00:05:53,217 --> 00:06:01,025
Let it go. You live in the hut in my backyard.
Let things happen as Manjunatha(god) wants it.

42
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:09,809
Washer man: Devappa, what a man you are. You are like god in this village.

43
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Devayya: No one's god in this village. There are only two kinds. One is humans and the other, demons. Come now.

44
00:06:24,422 --> 00:06:27,922
Devayya: Auntie, please cook something for them too.

45
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:37,300
Auntie: What's this Devappa? What will happen to us if you keep feeding all who come to you?

46
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:46,325
Devayya: It's Manjunatha(god) who gives all this. Everything will happen as he wishes. Go now.

47
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:14,482
One should smoke the weed. And forget everything in its ecstasy. ~ One should smoke the weed~

48
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:29,800
The body is a pipe filled with unquenchable desires. ~One should smoke the weed~

49
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:43,300
Light it with colours and drag on while you like it. ~ One should smoke the weed~

50
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Hey a song should impress at least a monkey even if it's written by a poet. Listen to me; I'll sing it.

51
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Light the pipe on to burn the weed like Boothayya to ashes.
Should break his back uniting everyone in the village. (Laughing) Did you understand what I said?

52
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:20,025
How should you fools understand?You are all who sign with your thumbs. You think Obbattu(sweet) when I say Oggattu(Unity).

53
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:28,700
Hey, you bunk in that Boothayya's house day and night like a limping bull in a gutter. Don't you feel ashamed?

54
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,100
Hey, though Kaurava killed all his brothers, Shakuni was on his side. Why?

55
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,625
To destroy Kaurava's family.

56
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,400
Just like that, this Singalayya aka Bundekyata is dwelling in that house to weed his family out.

57
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,425
Yes you will, only the weeds grown in his backyard.

58
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:57,905
Hey Bundekyata, he has made enormous lands
widening the split of the river Kaveri

59
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:05,931
When she(the river) couldn't do anything
what can you do? Just drag on this pipe.

60
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:15,600
When time comes, you will know what this Singalayya aka Bundekyata is.

61
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,700
Boothayya:How long will it take to make one stitch?

62
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,360
It's over sir.

63
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,740
Until now, I have made some 1000 stitches from toe to heel.

64
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,180
I'm marking the places to make stitches for future repairs.

65
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,960
Take them.

66
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,800
Sir, Money?

67
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,000
Boothayya: Money? Warm(Kaasu) your hands in fire.

68
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,820
Whom are you asking the money from?

69
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,900
You should pay me taxes for letting you use this place. Beware.

70
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,720
(Spits) Leech. Worse than a vulture.

71
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,300
Those creatures at least feed on the dead.
This man sucks the life out of the living.

72
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,880
Even though struck by paralysis twice,
he survived without paying a penny to the doctor.

73
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,320
If he gets one this time, he's into the grave for sure.

74
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,480
You're are the only one left from my mother's side.

75
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:45,060
You wouldn't come to see how sister and her children are living their lives?

76
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,700
What to do? We have married you off to such a house.

77
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Mother It's Grandpa.

78
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Boothayya has opened this charity house for the villagers to come and have food.
One should have shame.

79
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,700
Sit down Brother

80
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:34,260
Yes sit down. Your sister is asking, sit and enjoy the meal. Girija , give him a handful of butter and potful of milk.

81
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,900
It's been three years since we have seen each other. That's why he came to see me.

82
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:45,420
Yes. Relatives find all kinds of excuses to come and have a free meal.

83
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,760
You should keep them miles away. Keep this in mind.

84
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,480
What's this?
The sambar is smelling pleasant?

85
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,980
You are not getting it even after hundred times.

86
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,320
The sambar will last for three days if you don't boil the grams.

87
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,260
But will spoil the next day if you boil it. Did you understand?

88
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,400
Sir

89
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,180
Ayya.

90
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,540
Who is it?

91
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,300
Why are you yelling swami, swami?

92
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,880
Sir, I'm not feeling well from a few days now.

93
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,820
Would you kindly give me some pickle to have with my food?

94
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:38,900
I'll slap you on the face now. Do you think this is a charity house to donate pickle to everyone who drops by? Go now.

95
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:52,300
There's one who asks for pickle and another who sits and eats at my home. Where is my son Ayya gone when people are sweeping my house clean?

96
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,000
Hey Achary, look at this Ayya swim fearlessly in this deep river.

97
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,160
He doesn't care even if the river is full.

98
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,650
No one in the surrounding villages can swim like him. He's daring.

99
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,020
That is also right.

100
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,600
I got three rupees.

101
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,460
You won't even get half of what we need.

102
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,600
At least we got this much before she caught us. Come let's go.

103
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,480
Now you've learnt stealing too.

104
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:42,360
Would you call it stealing if I take what you hid from me?

105
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:49,890
Not bad man. You can boldly talk with your wife. I'm proud to say that you are my disciple.

106
00:14:49,915 --> 00:14:55,465
Puttamma, there's nothing wrong in this. Everything goes as offering to god.

107
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,140
So you are the one who taught my husband to steal?

108
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,620
These skills come by birth. I won't teach all these to my disciples.

109
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,700
Shut up. You were the one who taught smoking weed when he was just smoking cigarette.

110
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:16,480
Look, if you want any milk, come and drink anytime.
but don't take my husband for smoking weed.

111
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:28,040
Fine. We'll bring it here. Why don't you make a Ramarasa (intoxicating drink) out of it?
We'll enjoy here in your name.

112
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,500
Do as he says Putti.

113
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,100
Beware. Don't you dare call my husband again when I'm home.

114
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,400
Hmm. Did you understand Bundekyata?
Don't call me when my wife's at home.
Call me when she's not there. I'll come. Let's go now.

115
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,100
What's this? We couldn't keep what we got with so much effort?

116
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,140
Your bad luck. My wife caught us.

117
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,260
Shall we go to Achary's place?

118
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,620
Dear Lord Manjunatha of Dharmasthala

119
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,400
By training the bulls for two months...

120
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,780
My son has gone to the race confident of winning this time

121
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,780
Bless him with victory.

122
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:09,220
Year after year, Boothayya's son Ayya used to win the race.

123
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,960
This year, my son Gulla has won it.

124
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,800
As per village tradition, the winner gets this garland, silk scarf

125
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,440
This silk scarf

126
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,520
Though Gulla's bullocks won this race...

127
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,300
aren't Bhaira's bullocks strong and good looking?

128
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,400
Did you lay your eyes on them too? It's finished then.

129
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,920
Everything's Manjunatha's blessing.

130
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,480
Go to Dharmasthala (Pilgrimage) and return.

131
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,580
Yes Father.

132
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Sister Girija

133
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,220
Mahadevi, Are you fine?

134
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,920
It's been a long time since we met last time.
Arey, why are you looking so strangely? Have you forgotten me?

135
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,080
She's Mahadevi, my father's friend Shankarayya's niece.

136
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,720
Oh, isn't this the girl who accompanied you in our wedding?

137
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,780
Yes Sir. We have been friends since we were very young.

138
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,160
Are these children yours? They are adorable.

139
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,500
Why do I not see Thaali(Mangalasutra) in your neck?

140
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,520
Haven't found a good match for her.

141
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,080
Shankarayya, we have one in our village belonging to your caste.

142
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,760
Who is it?

143
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,400
Devayya's son, Gulla.

144
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,200
Yes yes. It will be a perfect match.

145
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,740
When you are recommending, I will definitely enquire.

146
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,660
Mahadevi

147
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,040
It's getting late for bus. Let's go.

148
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,020
Mahadevi, come to my village soon.

149
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,020
I'll leave then sister, sir.

150
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,680
ok

151
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,200
Girijakka, You too should visit my place once. It's Kelagur estate near Kalasapura.
You must visit.

152
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,940
You are like Chanakya.

153
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:17,920
You got a bund constructed to the river widening the riverbank and won all of it in auction.

154
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,240
You made good amount of land for yourself.

155
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:29,000
Count the money I spent to construct that bund and make that land cultivable.

156
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,200
Whatever may be the cost, you earned it all in an year.

157
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,340
Why do you envy that?

158
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,340
(Sighs) If only my wife hadn't died, I would've lived in this farmhouse...

159
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,700
and let the village house for rent.

160
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,220
Even that would've earned some money.

161
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,000
Oye, why are you so late?

162
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,260
Megalatti Dodda Shetty has died. I had gone to see him last time. That's why I got late sir.

163
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Stop it.

164
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,840
Put the body down.

165
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,600
Why Sir?

166
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,560
Pay my loan back and then take the body.

167
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,440
Loan?

168
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,380
When did my father take loan from you?

169
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,600
When did he borrow money?

170
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,200
If I hadn't lent the money, you wouldn't have married and had wife like now.

171
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,100
Look at this stamp paper.

172
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,380
Your father got this written and made his thumb impression. For 4000 rupees.

173
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
4000? 4000?

174
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,980
Yes.

175
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,540
Sir

176
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,220
What you gave...

177
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,220
what he took...

178
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,220
We can talk all that later.

179
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,020
First let them complete the funeral.

180
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,640
If I leave them now then my loan will go into the grave too.

181
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,200
I won't let them take the body until my loan is cleared.

182
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,100
Is this the right time to recover your loan?

183
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:17,025
I didn't care it's midnight when lending. I want my money including the interest here and now.

184
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Sir, I don't have any money left in the home.

185
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,440
I have even borrowed money from Devayya for this funeral.

186
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:27,425
Then borrow money from him and pay my money back.

187
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:33,650
If I had 4000 rupees, I would've given it to you and let them finish the funeral.

188
00:29:33,675 --> 00:29:39,375
No problem if you don't have cash. Write it on paper for me. I trust you.

189
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,300
Why should he write on the paper? I'll write it.

190
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:48,005
You don't have the money to give your father a proper funeral. What do i do with your paper? Lick it with pickle?

191
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:52,030
Not needed sir. I'll write it for you. Let them perform the rituals.

192
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,560
Though Doddashetty borrowed money from me, he lived truthfully all through his life.

193
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,260
Poor fellow, shouldn't have died this young.

194
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,100
Come now, finish the funeral.

195
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Where are you going? Write me the paper first.

196
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:46,800
Devayya was the only one who had escaped. Even he's consumed by that devil today.

197
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:55,220
Don't sit idle thinking I'm out of village. Milk the cows twice daily, supply them to the customers and keep the money safely in the box.

198
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,480
What? Keep all the money safely in the box.

199
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,620
Don't just smoke it all away. Understood?

200
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,160
You'll get late for the bus. Go now.

201
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,280
You are giving so much work now.

202
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,460
Don't just stay back where you are going. Come back soon

203
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,440
I know everything.

204
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,440
I'll leave then?
OK

205
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,380
Take care of the house.

206
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,340
What work shall i do?

207
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,100
Ha, I'll milk the cows and go to Achary's house.

208
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,400
What's this Chikka? You're milking the cow wearing a saree?

209
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,800
This cow doesn't like men.

210
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
It'll give milk only if it sees women.

211
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,720
That's why I'm wearing my wife's saree and milking the cow.

212
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,960
oh ok.

213
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:15,680
Don't kick.

214
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,040
I'm very tired and thirsty.

215
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,880
It can be quenched if you drink water.

216
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,060
Who'll give?

217
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,240
Who's there in the house?

218
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,220
I am.

219
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,200
If you wash your hands and feet and come inside, I'll give some sweet too with water.

220
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,920
Will you keep giving water like this forever?

221
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,940
If god wills that, I'll have to, wouldn't I?

222
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:58,460
We met, I visited your estate and am drinking this water. All by his grace, isn't it?

223
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,160
My brother left all the responsibilities of Mahadevi with me when he died.

224
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,380
By marrying her off to your son, I'm leaving her in your care.

225
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,720
Don't worry.

226
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,040
Your girl...

227
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,040
Though comes as a Daughter in law to our family,

228
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040
We'll look after her like my daughter.

229
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,660
That's what i wish for.

230
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,660
I'll ask the priest for an auspicious time for marriage.

231
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,840
By all means.

232
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,340
What is it Bhaira?

233
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,280
What?Why are you wandering like a monkey bitten by a scorpion?

234
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,760
I've lost my bullocks.

235
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,280
Oh that?

236
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,240
It's been a long time since my uncle Boothayya laid eyes on it, sold it in the market and by now its bones have been buried. Go.

237
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,120
Boothayya

238
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:02,940
Keep it there.

239
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,480
Who has this kind of virtue in this village except Boothayya?

240
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,720
Let it go.

241
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,340
Now don't keep quiet. Take revenge for the fire set in your belly.

242
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,920
Tell about the injustice to your people.

243
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,080
Assemble them.

244
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,480
Teach a befitting lesson to that Boothayya.

245
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,560
Don't tell anyone that I told you to do all these.

246
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,800
Boothayya!!

247
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,640
Sir? Sir?

248
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,460
Who's that? Shouting my name like that.

249
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,880
It's me. Siddi Bhaira.

250
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,940
Why are you yelling? Did your father die or your mother?

251
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,340
Why did you steal and sell my bullocks?

252
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:01,860
What? Have you come drunk first in the morning or are you certain that your life's over that you're ranting like this?

253
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:06,160
It's not my life that's over. It's yours.

254
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,660
Stop there.

255
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,240
You dare rise your hand against me? I'll kill you.

256
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,240
Che, What's this uncle?

257
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:49,920
Why did you come here to die over a dead issue? Go, go.

258
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,360
Let it go and save your life for your woman and children. Go.

259
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,860
Go.(winking) I say go.

260
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,940
This dog dared to touched me? I shouldn't let it without stamping Singalayya.

261
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,140
What is this uncle? You quarreling with these petty people.

262
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,740
Why use Brahmastra (mighty mythological weapon) on a sparrow?

263
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,140
You don't know. If I teach this one, the whole village will learn of the consequences.

264
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,580
If not taken care of, then tomorrow everyone will rise against me.

265
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,520
My hand!!

266
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,940
I know who set fire to my house.

267
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,960
If I don't set fire to their house, then my name is not Siddi Bhaira.

268
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,680
Poor man's anger only makes his jaw ache

269
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,960
You shouldn't speak of such things.

270
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,960
Come now, we'll go to our house.

271
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
Come.

272
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,760
Why do you look at that?

273
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,760
It's over.

274
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,360
Come now.

275
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,920
Uncle...

276
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,000
Uncle? Uncle, what happened?

277
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,620
I slipped and fell down.

278
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,620
Can't get up.

279
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,200
Right hand...

280
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,860
Right leg...

281
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,860
I have no control over them.

282
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,080
That means...

283
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,080
Paralysis...

284
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,220
You are struck again you say...

285
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,400
Ayyu...  Ayyu...

286
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,600
Your father had a stroke, come help me lift him and get him inside.

287
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,580
Father? father?
Singalayya: First lift him up.

288
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,420
Gulla, You were alone till now.

289
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,620
Now you are a married man.

290
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,980
Just don't be imprudent thinking you've responsibilities on your shoulders now.

291
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,620
To acquire wealth...

292
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,620
Don't leave Dharma...

293
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,260
If you can...

294
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,740
If god blesses you...

295
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,360
Help people...

296
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,600
Live harmoniously trusting your fellow villagers.

297
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,040
Don't trust

298
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,780
Don't trust anybody in the village.

299
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,020
Everyone's a thief

300
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,180
If you pity the farmers,

301
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,180
You'll suffer

302
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,540
Without heat,

303
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,540
butter won't melt.

304
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,540
Just like that, if he doesn't feel the heat...

305
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,740
a farmer won't pay up.

306
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,700
If you keep chiding him,

307
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,700
putting his hand in the pocket,

308
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,860
he'll take his money out

309
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,340
If you slip and start fraternising,

310
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,080
the money he has taken out,

311
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,400
will slip back into his pocket.

312
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,120
Remember that

313
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,080
That Devayya.

314
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,540
His house

315
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,720
has been a thorn in my side.

316
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:58,040
Always keep an eye on that.

317
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,720
I have the papers...

318
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,720
Use it when time comes.

319
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,040
Take this

320
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,780
Even if they swindle one rupee, kill one for that.

321
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:25,840
Father? father (cries)

322
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,660
I tried all night in all neighbouring villages

323
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:48,940
Nobody's willing to help us lift uncle's body even when I offered to pay money.

324
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,840
Why acquire so much wealth when one couldn't get people to help perform his last rites?

325
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,860
Doesn't matter

326
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,700
I know how to finish the funeral.

327
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,460
Sir?

328
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,240
Why did you come?

329
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,140
Who invited you here?

330
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,620
Village's elderly man has passed away

331
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,880
I came to pay him my last respects and help you with the last rites

332
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:21,180
If this is what you people intended, everybody should have come.

333
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,300
You've come alone.

334
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,360
Have the rest of them died?

335
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,360
Devayya, I don't need anybody's help.

336
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,760
Go back

337
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,700
When he's says he doesn't need help, what are you standing here for? Go.

338
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,980
At last you came forward to give me water.

339
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,480
Will you wash your feet and come inside or just keep staring at me?

340
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,060
If I eat I'll only satiate my hunger

341
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,940
It won't satisfy my eyes

342
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:51,840
By looking at you the hunger only grows

343
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,340
Alright, I'll keep looking at you

344
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,340
You keep looking at me

345
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,240
forgetting to sow or toil in the fields

346
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,060
Pray not say something like that.

347
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,580
You are my god given Mahadevi.

348
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,580
I'll do as you say.

349
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,580
Tell me what do you want me to do?

350
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,720
Wash your hands and feet, have your meals and then go to toil in the fields.

351
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,960
Alright

352
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,520
Ey Sannashetty, stop your oil mill.

353
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,600
Come settle your debts.

354
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,140
Where will I bring 4000 from?

355
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,440
Even If I work day and night, I am barely able to meet my expenses.

356
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,860
Then why did your father borrow money to get a beggar like you married?

357
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:40,960
Sir

358
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,800
Your father knew that my father didn't borrow money for my marriage.

359
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:46,560
What did you say?

360
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,600
Boothayya has produced fake papers in my father's name.

361
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,340
And now you're after me using that.

362
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:59,080
If you say that it's fake papers again I'll go to court and have your property auctioned.

363
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:03,180
Auction if you want or even burn us for that, we don't have a penny to give.

364
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,620
Do whatever you want

365
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:08,260
Yes I will. I know what to do.

366
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,480
On your father's funeral,

367
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,360
that Devayya who signed the surety bond

368
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:16,760
if I kick him, he'll cough up the money along with you.

369
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,880
Ey, what is it that you said?

370
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,560
You are talking loosely taking my father's name?

371
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,940
the situation demanded it.

372
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,180
Pretending to help the villagers,

373
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,100
your father is swindling all our money

374
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,220
Have you been smoking any weed or what?

375
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,660
Whose money has my father swindled?

376
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,260
Our money

377
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,440
Your father gave surety on this fellow's behalf

378
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,140
Did he ensure he paid back?

379
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,740
That day he spoke like a big man.

380
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,060
Why has kept quiet until now?

381
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,700
Pigs... Pigs waiting to hog up all our money

382
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,800
Hey mind your tongue

383
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,680
There is no bigger pig than your father.

384
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,080
Destitutes

385
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,340
Widows

386
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,760
Innocents sparing no one your father hogged up all their money like a porcupine

387
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,740
Gulla

388
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,600
Ayyu

389
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:45,200
Let me go uncle

390
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,480
I'll break his head

391
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,600
Will police let you go for this?

392
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,040
Ayyu

393
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:55,740
Your father killed so many so secretly

394
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:59,200
You should handle it like that instead of quarreling out in the open.

395
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,880
Come I'll explain

396
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,560
Hey

397
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,980
You dare raise your hand against me?

398
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,740
If I don't put you in jail and make you toil

399
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:10,880
then my name's not Ayyu, son of Boothayya

400
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,340
Hey If I don't finish you off by then

401
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,740
then I'm not Devayya's son Gulla

402
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,780
Remember that

403
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,600
Why do you quarrel like this Gulla? Let it go.

404
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,500
isn't it because you people didn't raise your voice,

405
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,900
that that Boothayya reined and his son seeks to do the same today

406
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,440
If only you had taught him a lesson then.

407
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,120
A cub born of tiger should act like one.

408
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,940
If you cower like a mouse, the whole village will consume you.

409
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,880
Let's go Uncle, I don't care if I have to spend a lakh(100000)

410
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,520
We will teach him a lesson

411
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,180
Why this persistence?

412
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,860
Calm yourself down and think about it.

413
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,000
I decided that only after thinking thoroughly

414
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:47,780
The villagers hate us already

415
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,460
And now if you go to court over this, then god save us.

416
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,760
What words you speak

417
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,880
Your husband seeks to fight the one who stood up against him

418
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,360
and hold the whole village in his control

419
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,120
You ask him to stay behind like a coward?

420
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,400
Not you, I pay no heed even to my dead father who's in heaven

421
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,600
I won't let that Gulla without cuffing him and sending to jail.

422
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,820
Let's go Uncle.

423
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:12,600
Please stop sir.

424
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,180
You shouldn't commit a mistake because the other did.

425
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,520
I apologise to you for my sons mistakes

426
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,520
Please forgive

427
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:20,620
This is nice

428
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,660
It's like beating one in the square

429
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:24,360
and beg forgiveness inside a room.

430
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,580
Devayya

431
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,160
I won't let this go until I see your son goes to grave

432
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,300
Don't sir, please

433
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:31,820
My son and you are both young.

434
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,300
You were born in the same village

435
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,560
You drink the same river water

436
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,940
You grew up playing on the same ground

437
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,300
If you cross swords like this

438
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,460
Can anyone live peacefully in future?

439
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,500
Possible

440
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,000
If you cut the hands of one who fights you, you can live peacefully.

441
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,400
Sannayya, please listen to me

442
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,040
Hot blood

443

444
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,760
Money will make you speak like that

445
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,200
Filling the head with revenge

446
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,720
This anger spoils a man

447
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,900
I fall at your feet

448
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,180
Please forgive, please forgive

01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,540

451

leave

453
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,320
Father how can I let go someone who kicked you?

454
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,180
When I don't take offense why do you get angry?

455
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,180
Father I'm your son.

456
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,240
I must protect your honour

457
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,200
How dare you disobey your father?

458
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,540
Go home.   I am telling you, go home.

459
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,100
You were saved today

460
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,580
My father intervened and saved you.

461
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:41,080
Hey who lives will be decided in court

462
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,680

This is the security bond his father signed

while this shakes him,

468
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,920
if we file a civil case against his father

They're finished you say?

470
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:16,240
finish them

471
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,940
Fees...

472
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,260
I don't care about the cost

473
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:20,640
I want him sent to jail

474
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,900
We shall

475
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,600
I'll have the plaint, police complaint typed

You come back later to sign it.

477
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,780
Now pay some 1000 as advance

478
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:37,840
When shall we come?

479
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,180
Come back after two hours

480
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,140
Alright

481
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:54,360
I forgot to tell him something. You wait here. I'll come back.

482

Swami

483
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,820
The sugarcane is juicy

484
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,180
squeeze it however you like.

485
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,160
But along with that...

486
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:15,440

whatever the cost

490
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,720
he should be cuffed

491
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:29,420
and taken in a procession around the village. That's all. I came to tell you that. I'll leave.

492
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,200
Alright

493
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,060
At last Ayyu went to court.

494
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,440
He has filed a criminal case saying you assaulted and attempted to murder him

495
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,440
Let him file. I'll also hire a lawyer.

496
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,380
I'll argue that he has filed the case because of his envy

497
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,300
I'll make his own case turn into a noose for him.

498
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,920
Do.

499
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:56,220
When you destroy each others house

500
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,480
You end losing everything and go begging

501
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,660
You mean I should go to jail?

502
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:04,460
I should jump into the ring, break his back and teach him

503
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:08,480
I'll see. Who'll be willing to become his witness? How he wins the case

504
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:18,960
Case, court and lawyer. These are the very things.  That ruin a farmer's life.

505
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:22,640
Go.   Go.

515
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,500
What to do I've no time.

516
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,660
I have to attend a court in the morning, another in the noon, and another in the evening

517
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:30,120
I've no time to take off my coat

518
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,280
You go to all those courts with only one coat?

519
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:36,020
Do police where different uniform for different stations?

520
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,580
By the way, what's your case? civil or criminal?

521
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,860
Gulla take it out. Please see what it is.

522
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,020
This is a very big case.

523
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,600
He too has hired a big lawyer.

524
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:58,160
To fight a case with lawyers like these, there is only one in town. That's me.

525
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,620
Yes sir. That's why we've come to you.

526
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,920
What to do? I've no time.

527
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,300
If I leave you, you'll surely lose the case.

528
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,300
Sir. Please consider this case.

529
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,340
To fight a case with such a lawyer,

530
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,980
My fees?

531
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:13,880
How much will it cost?

532
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,240
Not that much. You'll have to pay 200 every time I attend the court.

533
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,800
OK sir.

534
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,940
We'll make an arrangement.

535
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,560
Whenever you come to court I'll keep a count.

536
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,220
We'll settle at the end of the month.

537
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,040
Are you a milkman?

538
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,100
Yes sir.

539
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,400
That's my family business.

540
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,720
I don't add water.

541
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,720
That's why you say you'll keep a count?

542
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,320
Court matters don't work like that. You have to pay as you go.

543
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:37,880
Alright sir.

544
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:40,720
Pay 100rs as advance now.

545
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,280
I'll prepare the papers.

546
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,060
You can come in the evening and sign.

547
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,920
By the way, what village are you from?

548
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,760
Jalahalli

549
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,760
Ok Jalahalli. I've heard of it.

550
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:03,380
I've heard that butter is very good in your village. Bring some next time.

551
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:07,260
Sir, you win this case. I'll bring you 50 seru(a unit of measure).

552
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:51,140
Why did you yield to the poison of hate?

553
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:55,040
To lose all the happiness.

554
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,040
Oh fool.

555
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,600
Though Gulla won the case in district court, you won the case for us in high court.

556
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:10,260
Same way that civil case...

557
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:11,920
Anyway including court fee..

558
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,840
we have got it decreed that he has to pay 3678 rupees.

559
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:17,060
You got it decreed...

560
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,340
But...

561
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:19,700
you shouldn't have agreed for installments.

562
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,360
That is court's decision, there's nothing I can do.

563
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,140
Anyway he's a defaulter now...

564
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:26,140
if we proceed with action...

565
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,960
You mean, it's like killing the fallen with rock...

566
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,800
Teaching Ayyu a lesson...

567
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,000
saying you'll get him cuffed...

568
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,040
was like hitting a boulder with hand.

569
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,040
What to do? Luck is not on our side.

570
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,340
Say Gulla...

571
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:42,780
Why not go to Sugreeva's court?

572
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,300
It's not Sugreeva's court you idiot...

573
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:49,180
It's Supreme amma's court (Supreme court). Let's go there Gulla.

574
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:51,180
Let's think about it later.

575
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:54,680
Take this.

576
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,060
I only have this much.

577
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,960
Get yourselves something to eat

578
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:00,280
and come to Bus stand. I'll have bought the tickets.

579
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,220
What will you have?

580
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:03,040
I'm not hungry

581
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,420
Poor fellow.

582
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:07,340
When he had the money,

583
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,940
he gave them away in bunches.

584
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:10,220
he probably has only this much left now.

585
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:13,880
But how to get meals for 4 with 2 rupees?

586
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,880
We have to somehow manage.

587
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,600
Come, let's see if we can manage.

588
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:19,660
Do something.

589
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,500
You have meals?

590
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,780
Don't you see the board?

591
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:38,920
How much for full meals?

592
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:39,760
2 rupees.

593
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,140
2 rupees? give me.

594
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,360
It's 8 rupees for 4.

595
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,020
I'll have the meals.

596
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:48,320
They have all had their meals.

597
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,840
They've just come with me.

598
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,680
Should we buy tickets for that too?

599
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,100
No need. Go and sit down.

600
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:55,380
Manjunatha one full meals

601
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,980
I've paid 2 rupees, bring a big (banana) leaf

602
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:09,900
Take this

603
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,780
Hey Sannashetty

604
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,640
Build a dam out of rice and swim in the sambar.

605
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:16,460
Achary, just keep looking how I'll swim.

606
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:46,980
Rice.

607
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:20,640
Rice.

608
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:53,560
Rice.

609
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:01,800
Bring some sambar.

610
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,700
Hey bring some rice.

611
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,700
There's no rice.

612
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:29,720
No rice?

613
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,600
Hey Mister(calling hotel owner), come here.

614
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:32,740
You keep quiet.

615
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,140
What is this? He's saying there's no rice left?

616
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:36,220
Is this your full meals?

617
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,580
Look here, three vessels full of rice is over.

618
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:40,580
He's not even started curd rice.

619
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,460
Serving only three spoonful,

620
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:43,760
you say three vessels?

621
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,940
What now? will you serve rice now...

622
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:48,020
or deduct money for what I've eaten and give me the rest?

623
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:49,540
Swami, come I'll give.

624
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:51,780
Manjunatha, there's full meals from now on.

625
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:52,520
only plate meals.

626
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,020
change the board.  - OK sir.

627
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:55,660
Get us some beetle leaf with that.

628
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,300
Didn't it end where it had to?

629
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,480
wise men knew...

630
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,640
One who wins the case loses...

631
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,260
and the one who loses dies...

632
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,160
No.. never suffer this...

633
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,480
taking quarrels to court...

634
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,020
and be left without even a sandal.

635
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,480
You didn't listen to me even after I warned you many times.

636
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:34,980
Is it over now?

637
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,120
Did the court decision settle it?

638
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,240
Along with the court's decision...

639
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:44,360
everything else was also decided then, you say.

640
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:47,180
It's settled then you say.

641
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,100
Sit down.

642
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,000
I was worried you might not come.

643
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:29,260
It's like goddess Gouri herself came here.

644
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,020
Born in the same village...

645
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,880
we grew up playing together.

646
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,880
By god's grace got married to in the same town.

647
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:36,920
But...

648
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:40,760
We are unable to talk to each other face to face.

649
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,980
When your husband and mine are fighting...

650
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:46,300
how can we talk.

651
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,440
Let it go.

652
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,880
You've become so weak.

653
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,600
Is your husband taking care of you?

654
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:55,360
He loves me more than his life.

655
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,120
My father-in-law cares for me like his own daughter.

656
01:18:58,260 --> 01:18:59,760
I don't lack anything.

657
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:01,760
Then tell your husband...

658
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,960
at least now that he forgets everything

659
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,600
and become friends with my husband.

660
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,260
If they unite...

661
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:08,940
how our life would be.

662
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:10,980
I know sister.

663
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,280
Even father-in-law told the same thing a thousand times.

664
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,100
but he won't listen.

665
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,420
Just like your husband, mine is adamant.

666
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,660
What can we do?

667
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,320
It's late. I'll leave.

668
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:27,000
Wait a moment.

669
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:37,640
Take this.

670
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,780
No. I don't want this.

671
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:41,020
Today's Gouri (goddess) festival.

672
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,020
A married woman like you must not be sent empty handed.

673
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,560
Take.

674
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,600
I'll leave.

675
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:03,660
Mahadevi

676
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,200
What's all this?

677
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:06,760
Where did you bring this from?

678
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,440
Girijakka gave this.

679
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,840
'Your husband has become a pauper after the case...'

680
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,600
'come I'll give you some alms' is what she said. Isn't it?

681
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:16,900
It's Gouri festival.

682
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,880
She only called me for Kumkum (a ritual)

683
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,160
I went

684
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:22,940
She gave me all this.

685
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,800
Then you should've taken only the kumkum.

686
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,280
Leaving that.

687
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,240
Rice, grams and sugar...

688
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,720
with that another 100 rupees.

689
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:31,720
Why did you agree to take all this?

690
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,500
I didn't see her putting 100 rupees in the basket.

691
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,020
She gave without you asking?

692
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,660
You lie to me?

693
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,580
Gulla, Gulla, leave her.

694
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,380
Why do you beat this pregnant?

695
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,040
She has insulted me.

696
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,220
Bringing all this from Ayya's wife, she's lying now.

697
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,680
No uncle,no.

698
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:04,460
I vow in Manjunatha's name, I didn't ask them anything.

699
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:07,660
Take this.

700
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:09,660
Throw this at their face and come back.

701
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:10,600
And tell them.

702
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,160
this Gulla will never bow down and beg them even if he dies.

703
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,260
Go.

704
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,460
Why?

705
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,780
I don't deserve to keep this.

706
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:30,940
If I take this basket back...

707
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,520
it's not good for you or me.

708
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:36,840
The day my husband and your husband fought...

709
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,840
and went to court...

710
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,820
our bad times started then.

711
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,440
Mahadevi

712
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:56,960
How long have you been doing this?

713
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,240
The very enemy who crosses sword with me...

714
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:03,720
is supplied with money, food and grains from my home?

715
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:06,760
Now I know...

716
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,500
even though Gulla had become a destitute...

717
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,500
how he managed court matters.

718
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:13,500
Tell me.

719
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,340
What all have you given them while you threw dust in my eyes?

720
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:18,520
I've given them nothing.

721
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,520
I have never thrown dust in your eyes.

722
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:22,520
I had called her for Gouri festival.

723
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:23,600
She came.

724
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,600
I gave her dakshina and gave her this basket.

725
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,640
Dakshina(money)?

726
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,220
of 100 rupees?

727
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:30,940
Did you bring it from your father's home?

728
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:32,580
Girija.

729
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,740
If she steps into my house once again...

730
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,480
I'll kill you both with the revolver.

731
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,500
Beware.

732
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,440
Hey, let me join with you.

733
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,240
My father will scold me if I play with you. Go.

734
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:00,360
Let me join you in the games.

735
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:01,800
We won't play with you. Go

736
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:04,600
Come. Let's go.

737
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:09,620
Mother, mother.

738
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:12,140
No one's letting us join the games.

739
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:14,480
Everybody runs away when they see us.

740
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,640
Our life has fallen to this.

741
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,740
where will it take us in future?

742
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,280
What is it?

743
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,660
See their faces. You'll know.

744
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,720
No one's letting them join the games.

745
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,020
No need.

746
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,900
No need for my children to mingle with those poor and dirty kids.

747
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:31,760
You mean...

748
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,920
should the growing kids sit at home without playing in the sun.

749
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:35,780
Yes.

750
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,380
Then these two will also become like their father and grandfather.

751
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:40,800
Even if they live in the village...

752
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,800
they will live their lives like lonely owls.

753
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,880
Only if we live like that we can control these people.

754
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:46,980
Swami.

755
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,200
Swami

756
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,460
Who's that?

757
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:53,640
What is it?

758
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,400
spare me some pickles..

759
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,860
Hey, you didn't get rid of that pickle disease?

760
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:02,440
Only when I eat it does it satisfy me, doesn't it?

761
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,680
Please give me some.

762
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,680
Do you think this is charity home for pickles?

763
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,780
If you come asking for pickles again...

764
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,480
I'll break your legs. Go.

765
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:13,000
Pickles.

766
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:14,320
Mr.Sambayya?

767
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:15,800
Oh, please come.

768
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:20,980
Court has given permission to auction Devayya's house.

769
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:31,480
Auction.

770
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:33,660
Auction.

771
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,660
Devayya's house is auctioned.

772
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:39,760
For the debt owed to Boothayya's son, Sambayya...

773
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,840
As per court's order...

774
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:43,520
Tuesday

775
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,960
at 10:30 AM

776
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,960
Devayya's house is auctioned.

777
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:50,800
Those who wish...

778
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:53,540
can participate and buy the property in auction.

779
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:54,860
Auction.

780
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:58,640
Devayya's house is auctioned.

781
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,580
Auction

782
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,820
My house is auctioned.

783
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:23,460
Did you hear that, Mahadevi?

784
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,780
My life...

785
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,260
has fallen to the streets.

786
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,360
How can go out with respect?

787
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,040
After losing the honour...

788
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,160
what's the difference if one lives or dies?

789
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:38,560
My grandfather...

790
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:39,780
father...

791
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,260
I...

792
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,500
This house where you husband grew up...

793
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:48,780
is slipping out of hands before your child is even born.

794
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:55,900
Over.

795
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:58,820
It's over.

796
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,620
Our bond with this house is over.

797
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:20,800
Father.

798
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:21,820
Mahadevi.

799
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:22,860
Mahadevi

800
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,720
Father in law had so much money.

801
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,720
We couldn't even find four people.

802
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:24,220
Devayya didn't even have proper food.

803
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:26,220
The whole village is seeing him off.

804
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:29,580
This is the fortune one must earn.

805
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,880
Why are you sharpening it?

806
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,020
Why are you honing the machete like this?

807
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,480
To have a sharp edge.

808
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:40,220
The head should fall down as soon as it hits.

809
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:42,300
Whose head?

810
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:44,620
That Ayya, who brought death to my father.

811
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:46,620
His head.

812
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:49,380
Murder. Will you murder Ayya?

813
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:50,460
Yes.

814
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:51,920
Him.

815
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:54,040
I can rest only when I have killed him.

816
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:56,140
My father can rest in peace.

817
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:58,340
After that?

818
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,300
After that police will take you.

819
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:01,700
Let them hang me.

820
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:04,380
By killing a crook like Ayya...

821
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:06,920
my name will be praised all over the village.

822
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:12,140
You lost everything by adamant like this.

823
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,300
You lost a god like father.

824
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:17,700
By losing your life, you'll make me beg me in the streets.

825
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,700
No. No.

826
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:23,320
Not you. Even if the god himself told me, I wouldn't stop.

827
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:25,460
I'll kill him wherever I see him.

828
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:29,820
His head will fall to this machete.

829
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:31,060
Then kill me before that.

830
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:33,320
It's better that I die when you're alive.

831
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,320
Mahadevi, don't stop me now.

832
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:38,160
Don't come in front of me until I've killed him,

833
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,760
Or talk to me. Go.

834
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,660
Please listen to me.

835
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,760
Go.

836
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:18,100
He's honing his machete?

837
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:19,620
to kill me?

838
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:21,700
Even after I taught him a lesson...

839
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,220
he still don't get it, does he?

840
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:27,560
His father's death has made him like that.

841
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:29,560
He says he'll kill you wherever he sees you.

842
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:30,760
Let him come.

843
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,080
Before he lifts his weapon...

844
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:35,640
I'll fire the bullets and spill the blood out of his heart.

845
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:37,160
I know sir.

846
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:39,020
You have a pistol.

847
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,780
And money to escape from law.

848
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:42,620
What do we have?

849
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:43,860
Losing everything...

850
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,420
Kumkum on my forehead...

851
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,440
and thaali is all I am left with.

852
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,880
Please don't take this too sir.

853
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:51,780
No.

854
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:53,560
I'll save your thaali...

855
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,560
and remove my wife's huh?

856
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:57,220
Mahadevi.

857
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,520
This is Boothayya's son Ayyu.

858
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:02,040
To all those scoundrels who pounce on me...

859
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:04,200
I won't leave them without firing my bullets.

860
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,400
Don't sir.

861
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:06,740
You are wise...

862
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,100
educated...

863
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,520
and one who must show mercy to the destitute.

864
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:12,520
Till his anger dies down...

865
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,460
Please hide somewhere for three days...

866
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:15,540
and save us

867
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:17,880
Why are you telling me this?

868
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,500
Go and tell him.

869
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:21,140
He can listen to you...

870
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:24,240
or instead tell him to dig his own grave.

871
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:27,040
He'll drop dead even before he steps into the house.

872
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:28,920
You can come back later for his dead body.

873
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,180
Go.

874
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:32,560
Sir, Sir.

875
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:35,760
Girijakka, Girijakka.

876
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:38,420
Both are not listening.

877
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:41,220
Doesn't matter who kills whom.

878
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:43,760
We'll stand on the streets like beggars.

879
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:46,280
I don't care if I don't have food or clothes

880
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:49,380
I only want my husband to live and now...

881
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:51,380
even that is in danger.

882
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:54,600
How do we endure these murders?

883
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,860
Mahadevi... Mahadevi...

884
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:25,260
Stop.

885
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:27,720
Why?

886
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:28,980
Don't go out.

887
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:31,280
If I won't, he'll come here.

888
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:32,440
Let him come.

889
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,420
We'll reason with him.

890
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:36,400
For one who's coming to chop the head, it's not the advice that he deserves...

891
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,880
should kill him.

892
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:39,620
What do you gain from that?

893
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,580
Seeing how he'll end up...

894
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:44,020
the whole village will fear me and prostrate in front of me.

895
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,820
Father kept telling the same and behaved merciless like a butcher.

896
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:49,280
That's why in front of my father...

897
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,860
the whole village used to shake.

898
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:52,340
That's what has come as death to you.

899
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:53,760
the injustice you do now...

900
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,480
will come as death to our children.

901
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,040
Girija

902
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,280
I've tolerated enough.

903
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,520
If I keep quiet now...

904
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,140
the whole family will be perished.

905
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:07,860
That's why I stand before you.

906
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:08,760
Tell me.

907
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:10,760
Why is that Gulla after you?

908
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,760
His life is over that's why.

909
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:13,740
No.

910
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:15,300
The injustice you did..

911
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,500
has angered him.

912
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:18,680
riled him up.

913
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:21,760
You got his house auctioned.

914
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,300
When he could not tolerate the shame,

915
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:25,080
Devayya committed suicide.

916
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:27,920
I only got it auctioned for the debt he owed me...

917
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:30,380
I didn't hand him the rope.

918
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:31,840
You didn't give the rope.

919
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,420
But you tom-tommed in the whole village.

920
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:42,940
Poor fellow. Only if you had shown some mercy, Devayya would have lived.

921
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:48,680
You hastened.

922
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,080
He died because of you.

923
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:52,080
You are the murderer. You

924
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:07,220
Devayya was a poor man.

925
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:09,960
When he died, the whole village went to his funeral.

926
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:31,060
My uncle was rich.

927
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:32,400
When he died,

928
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:35,980
because we couldn't find four people to help, we had to take him in a cart.

929
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,760
If you keep on building these evil thoughts,

930
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,340
when we die in the future,

931
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:58,080
we won't even get a cart to carry our bodies.

932
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,080
Remember that.

933
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:12,480
Stop.

934
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,560
If you want to follow in father's footsteps,

935
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:16,660
and don't care if the village turns against us,

936
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:18,540
and be adamant about it,

937
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:20,380
then kill me and my children first,

938
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:22,380
and do whatever you want to.

939
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,660
Hey Linga.

940
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,900
Gulla's wife has fallen into the water.

941
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:33,920
Go save her.

942
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:35,640
I can't

943
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:38,180
Only Ayya can dive into this mighty river.

944
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:39,220
Ayya?

945
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:42,060
Even the wet grass thrown between them will catch fire.

946
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,060
Will he save Gulla's wife?

947
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:18,200
Go. Go quickly fetch a blanket.

948
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:14,220
Girijakka.

949
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:28,320
Having lost house, father and everything.

950
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,020
he stands like a pauper.

951
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:33,240
you thought, 'why to stay with him' and decided to go to heaven, is it?

952
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:34,960
If you had gone,

953
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,680
I would've stayed back?

954
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:39,160
Tell me. Why did you do this?

955
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:40,900
Why did you jump into the river?

956
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:44,300
To kill Ayya...

957
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:46,040
You had picked up the machete.

958
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:47,720
To kill you,

959
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,540
Ayya picked his gun.

960
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:55,460
I thought of killing myself when I still had the fortune of you being alive.

961
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:04,080
If someone else had saved you,

962
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:06,060
I would've bowed to them touching their feet.

963
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:07,360
But...

964
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:10,400
But the one who saved your life is my enemy Ayya.

965
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:13,760
He taunts me 'you hapless who couldn't save your wife's life...

966
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:16,260
see that I've saved her life.'

967
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:18,260
He has dishonoured me.

968
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:22,960
Under the pretence of helping me, he insulted me.

969
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:28,040
Greetings Vakil (Lawyer) saab.

970
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:31,200
Come Harakmal, sit down.

971
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:35,280
Fan, sofa, office, house, you have changed so much.

972
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:39,060
What do you bring? Civil case or criminal?

973
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:42,620
Half of this and half of that.

974
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,900
I want to decree on Jalahalli Gulla.

975
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:47,200
What does he have now?

976
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:49,200
Whatever he had, he has given it to me.

977
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,640
He's given my money to you?

978
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:53,640
Then you clear his debts.

979
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,140
You're intelligent.

980
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:57,360
Fine.

981
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:00,260
But what will you get if you get a decree on him now?

982
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:03,460
If I don't get anything, I'll have warrant issued and have him sent to jail.

983
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:05,400
Don't don't it for free. Charge for your service.

984
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:08,860
Even if you give me money, I shouldn't file a case against my old clients.

985
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:10,280
That's professional ethics.

986
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:12,280
You wouldn't understand. Go see another lawyer.

987
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:14,940
Oh forget it. I'll see some other lawyer.

988
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:32,040
Ameen saab, this is Devayya's son, Gulla, catch him.

989
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:35,960
Gulla, for the money you owe this gentleman, he has got the warrant issued in your name.

990
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,960
As per court's order, you're arrested now.

991
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:42,400
Why did you do this sir?

992
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,220
If you had waited for another two days...

993
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:45,940
You would have fled.

994
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:49,700
How will you clear my debt? Property, money what do you have?

995
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:51,220
Even if I've lost everything.

996
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,220
I've not lost my strength.

997
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:55,720
If you put him in jail,

998
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:56,780
will you get your money?

999
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,120
No, sir. You leave him now.

1000
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,120
We'll somehow return your money.

1001
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,900
What'll you do? how'll you clear? Tell.

1002
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:06,960
I'll labour. Even clean somebody's bathroom if need be.

1003
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:08,880
We husband and wife will both work,

1004
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:11,220
and clear your debts. Now let us go.

1005
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:14,780
I've listened to these promises many a times. Ameen saab, take him.

1006
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:20,360
Stop Ameen saab. Stop.

1007
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:26,100
Why did you come here?

1008
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:27,880
To laugh at me?

1009
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:29,880
See.

1010
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:31,420
I'm going to jail.

1011
01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:32,780
Go tom-tom it to everyone.

1012
01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:33,720
Let's go Ameen saab.

1013
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:34,580
Stop.

1014
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:37,320
You want your money or you want him sent to jail?

1015
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:39,600
If I send him to jail, I'll have to pay for it.

1016
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,040
I want only the money.

1017
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,040
I'll give you your money.

1018
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:45,360
No. I don't need your charity.

1019
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,360
What'll you do in jail?

1020
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,360
I'll do manual labour.

1021
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,820
I'll do whatever I'm told. What do you care?

1022
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:54,320
Can you clear your debt with that?

1023
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:57,420
Will your pregnant wife be happy with that?

1024
01:44:57,420 --> 01:44:59,420
Or will you be have honour in this village?

1025
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,080
His debt... I'll clear it.

1026
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,200
I said I don't need your charity.

1027
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,720
Didn't you hear?

1028
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:07,700
It's not charity, a debt.

1029
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,800
A debt to take me out of another?

1030
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,780
If you don't repay that debt, you'll have to go to jail.

1031
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:16,700
Even if you don't repay this one, you don't have to go to jail.

1032
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:18,120
How'll I clear your debt?

1033
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:21,340
You mentioned that you'll do manual labour.

1034
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:23,340
Do the same work in my home.

1035
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:24,980
Take your wages and repay the debt.

1036
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:40,580
Alright.

1037
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:43,680
Let's go sir. I'll give your money.

1038
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:48,100
Even if I've lost everything I've not forgotten our enmity.

1039
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:52,420
Until I've buried you and avenged my father's death, I can't rest.

1040
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:54,760
By saving me from jail,

1041
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:56,760
don't think my anger has died down.

1042
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:58,760
Tell me whatever job you want me to do.

1043
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:00,340
I'll work. Let's go.

1044
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:24,620
It's a boy.

1045
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:49,270
He's cutting wood relentlessly since morning.

1046
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:52,680
Haven't drunk any water or taken any rest. Poor fellow.

1047
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,680
Enough. Tell him to go home.

1048
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:56,760
Let him see his Mahadevi and his son.

1049
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:10,440
Gulla.

1050
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,840
Why are you working without rest?

1051
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:18,280
It's the servant's job.

1052
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,380
Your working with all integrity.

1053
01:49:20,660 --> 01:49:23,160
A job that's supposed to take a week for four men...

1054
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:24,900
you're doing it in one day.

1055
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:27,460
Then take four people's wages.

1056
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:29,260
You'll clear your debts sooner.

1057
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:31,040
I don't want your pity.

1058
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:33,040
Give me one man's wage, that's enough.

1059
01:49:57,020 --> 01:50:01,460
Singalayya: Carry them quickly. Ayya shouldn't know that I'm with you.

1060
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:30,820
Hey Gulla.

1061
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,920
We thought we could steal some thinking it's you on watch.

1062
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:36,920
But you'll hand us over?

1063
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:38,920
Now I'm his servant.

1064
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:40,920
A loyal dog.

1065
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:44,300
The one who ruined your life,

1066
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:47,700
made your father to die, don't you have that fire in you to avenge?

1067
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:50,500
I serve him like his son only till I've repaid his debt.

1068
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:52,960
After that, I'm my father's son.

1069
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:55,900
Once the debt is repaid, I'll have my revenge.

1070
01:50:57,500 --> 01:51:00,620
If any of you come here again,

1071
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:02,780
I'll cut them and bury under the trees.

1072
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:04,780
Go.

1073
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:33,940
Why did you come to work today?

1074
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:36,380
Your debt was cleared yesterday.

1075
01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:39,020
From today, you're debt free.

1076
01:51:39,020 --> 01:51:41,020
Independent.

1077
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:42,540
I too know that.

1078
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:44,540
I came here to say that I'm leaving.

1079
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:45,680
Why do you want to go?

1080
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:47,960
Everybody likes you so much.

1081
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,260
No work gets done without you.

1082
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:51,980
Be here as you like,

1083
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:55,600
independent, happily like my brother.

1084
01:51:56,180 --> 01:51:57,860
I had to repay you,

1085
01:51:57,860 --> 01:51:59,860
I stayed.

1086
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:02,060
Now I've to take revenge,

1087
01:52:02,060 --> 01:52:04,060
I'm going.

1088
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:46,560
Stop.

1089
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:51,140
Stop this animal sacrifice.

1090
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:53,140
Why should we stop? We can't.

1091
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:55,060
A fair that's been stopped for three years,

1092
01:56:55,060 --> 01:56:56,220
we are celebrating this year.

1093
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:57,160
Celebrate the festival

1094
01:56:57,160 --> 01:56:58,020
But

1095
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:00,740
In the name of celebration, don't kill this buffalo.

1096
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:02,140
Why should we stop?

1097
01:57:02,140 --> 01:57:04,900
Shouldn't we please our Goddess Maramma by offering this sacrifice?

1098
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:05,820
Yes ask him that.

1099
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:08,680
A great power who's mother to all universe,

1100
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,800
you want to please her with buffalo?

1101
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:14,520
Is our mother so hungry that she'll eat an innocent animal?

1102
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:15,240
Then?

1103
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:17,640
What our ancestors did was wrong?

1104
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:19,380
What are you talking?

1105
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:22,200
Our ancestors who were taken over by superstitious beliefs,

1106
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:24,820
had some bad customs too.

1107
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:26,620
Only thing that must be sacrificed,

1108
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:29,320
is our ignorance.

1109
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:31,340
not this animal that breathes with life.

1110
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:35,940
Can we fore go all our customs just because this man says so?

1111
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:37,440
Can we fore go?

1112
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:43,440
[Crowd says not possible]

1113
01:57:46,220 --> 01:57:48,180
You all want to sacrifice.

1114
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:50,500
I'm the only one who opposes it.

1115
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:53,460
As you wish.

1116
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:56,380
Let that mother save you.

1117
01:58:10,140 --> 01:58:12,620
Do you know why Ayya opposes the sacrifice?

1118
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:16,140
If we don't kill, then village will suffer.

1119
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:18,420
stopping this festival is enough...

1120
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:21,280
to bring all plagues to the village.

1121
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:23,280
He's scheming, if the whole village is cleared...

1122
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:26,920
then he can stay alone and own this land.

1123
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:27,980
It seems like that.

1124
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:31,480
It seems to you? Well you're that dumb.

1125
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,840
Fools who don't know how to write or read.

1126
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,840
He knows that if he lifts his sword,

1127
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:38,580
you'll bow your heads down like sheep.

1128
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:42,160
Your forefathers worked hard only to fill Boothayya's coffers.

1129
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:44,160
We worked and filled Ayya's...

1130
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:46,780
Understand this clearly.

1131
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:50,000
In future, your children will work for Ayya's children.

1132
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:53,000
Is this village only there to serve one Ayya's house?

1133
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
[Crowd shouts no]

1134
01:58:58,160 --> 01:59:01,560
Is there anyone in this village who doesn't owe a debt to Boothayya?

1135
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:05,980
In future, if Ayya files a case, then everybody should work for him. You know that?

1136
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:10,660
Do you know papers with thumb impressions lie in his house like bales of hay?

1137
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:12,480
First we should grab those papers back.

1138
01:59:12,540 --> 01:59:17,200
[Crowd shouts yes]

1139
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:18,320
With that...

1140
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:22,280
we should steal all that money he has stashed by ruining us.

1141
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:24,280
[Crowd shouts yes]

1142
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:26,040
If you all join hands,

1143
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:28,300
we can do it today. Now.

1144
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:31,220
Yes. Today. Now.

1145
01:59:31,220 --> 01:59:33,620
First do this. Then we'll finish the festival.

1146
01:59:33,620 --> 01:59:36,100
[Crowd shouts yes]

1147
01:59:36,860 --> 01:59:38,980
Break the back of anyone who opposes you when entering.

1148
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:40,320
cut their hands.

1149
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:41,960
If they won't budge even to that,

1150
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:43,820
chop their heads off.

1151
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:01,920
Who?

1152
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:04,400
Who's that?

1153
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:05,580
Don't open the door.

1154
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:07,820
No one's answering.

1155
02:00:08,220 --> 02:00:09,940
Why have they come at this hour?

1156
02:00:10,220 --> 02:00:11,660
Festival is going on...

1157
02:00:11,660 --> 02:00:13,660
they must have come to ask for something.

1158
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:16,080
I'm scared.

1159
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:19,440
Don't fear. You sleep. I'll look into it.

1160
02:02:32,020 --> 02:02:35,060
Singalayya: Hey Chikka, Sannashetty , Achary...

1161
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:38,200
Come here. Go inside.

1162
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:48,860
Those who touch women and children...

1163
02:04:48,860 --> 02:04:52,000
and snatch their gold, I'll cut their hands. Beware.

1164
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:20,160
Come. We'll go to house near the bunds.

1165
02:08:04,340 --> 02:08:05,820
Greetings.

1166
02:08:05,940 --> 02:08:08,320
Even if you didn't lodge the complaint, we came to know.

1167
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:10,460
We've come here to take action as per law.

1168
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:11,280
Please cooperate.

1169
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:12,320
What do you need?

1170
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:13,960
I've gathered all the villagers.

1171
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:17,320
Among these, who broke into your house and who set fire to it?

1172
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:47,060
I've enquired each of them.

1173
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:49,620
No one's telling the truth. Can you please tell what happened?

1174
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:08,720
No one among these broke into my house.

1175
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:13,100
What are you saying?

1176
02:09:13,100 --> 02:09:15,100
I'm saying what I need to.

1177
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:17,100
Nobody broke into my house.

1178
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:23,500
Do you fear that all the villagers are united?

1179
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:25,500
I'll get you all the support.

1180
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:26,580
Please tell.

1181
02:09:26,580 --> 02:09:28,580
I've said.

1182
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:30,960
Then how did this house catch fire?

1183
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:34,580
In the room where the cattle are tied,

1184
02:09:34,580 --> 02:09:36,580
electric lamp wasn't working.

1185
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:39,140
The worker who took the lantern and went in there,

1186
02:09:39,140 --> 02:09:41,140
he forgot there.

1187
02:09:41,140 --> 02:09:43,780
At some point, the lantern must have been kicked by the cattle,

1188
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:45,780
which lit the hay and the house.

1189
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:48,140
Then.

1190
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:50,820
All the villagers helped together...

1191
02:09:51,660 --> 02:09:53,400
and saved my wife and children.

1192
02:10:09,500 --> 02:10:11,660
If you say so...

1193
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:13,480
who shall we file the case against.

1194
02:10:13,580 --> 02:10:14,920
Don't file any case on anyone.

1195
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:16,740
No one has done any wrong.

1196
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:19,740
Somebody must have given you wrong information and troubled you.

1197
02:10:19,740 --> 02:10:21,000
Please forgive me.

1198
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,820
Sir, telegram.

1199
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:39,000
My aunt in Mysore seems to be seriously ill.

1200
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,580
I have to leave urgently.

1201
02:10:40,580 --> 02:10:42,580
I'll leave Inspector. Forgive me.

1202
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:51,100
Just two days. I'll be back after I've seen her.

1203
02:10:51,420 --> 02:10:52,960
I'm alone here.

1204
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:56,220
There's nothing to fear. I'll come as soon as possible.

1205
02:10:56,220 --> 02:10:57,440
I'll leave?

1206
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:07,740
Chandru, Gouri.

1207
02:14:02,060 --> 02:14:03,740
Mother, mother.

1208
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:05,080
What is it child?

1209
02:14:05,080 --> 02:14:08,080
Will we drown like our house?

1210
02:14:08,080 --> 02:14:10,080
No. I'm with you, am in not?

1211
02:14:13,420 --> 02:14:17,120
Why is it sounding like never before?

1212
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:20,200
By the sound of the river, it seems Boothayya's bunds must have given up.

1213
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:23,020
Girijakka and her children?

1214
02:14:23,020 --> 02:14:25,020
They're in the house near that bund.

1215
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:25,880
Their fate?

1216
02:14:25,880 --> 02:14:27,300
Ayya is also not in house.

1217
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:33,920
Madam.

1218
02:16:43,420 --> 02:16:46,840
Gulla. Come . Come fast.

1219
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:50,280
Don't fear. Don't fear.

1220
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:53,680
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1221
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:55,960
Gulla, come.

1222
02:17:24,380 --> 02:17:26,280
Gulla, come.

1223
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:39,010
Madam, hold the children tightly.

1224
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:15,280
Hold the children tightly.

1225
02:20:37,420 --> 02:20:39,980
Madam, please throw some water out.

1226
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:29,760
Gulla.

1227
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:29,240
Get the children down.

1228
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:49,400
Gulla.

1229
02:22:49,540 --> 02:22:53,020
Ayya who knows swimming, jumped into the river and saved your wife that day.

1230
02:22:53,300 --> 02:22:57,740
Not knowing how to swim, you jumped into the river and saved his wife and children.

1231
02:22:57,820 --> 02:23:00,980
That way both have cleared all kinds of debt to each other.

1232
02:23:00,980 --> 02:23:04,020
Good. Good. Come. Let's go.

1233
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:56,060
Gulla.

1234
02:23:56,820 --> 02:23:59,320
Without caring for your life, you jumped into the river...

1235
02:23:59,320 --> 02:24:01,320
and saved my wife and children.

1236
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:04,380
Now, I'm in your debt.

1237
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:06,540
How shall I repay you?

1238
02:24:07,380 --> 02:24:08,380
Leave it sir.

1239
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:10,000
What did I do?

1240
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:12,640
You saved my wife.

1241
02:24:13,260 --> 02:24:14,640
When I was to go to jail,

1242
02:24:14,920 --> 02:24:16,300
you saved my honour.

1243
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:18,420
Since my anger didn't die down then,

1244
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:20,120
and because my eyes were red,

1245
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:22,860
whatever you did seemed red to me.

1246
02:24:23,640 --> 02:24:25,080
It's you who have helped.

1247
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:29,140
By not handing over those who broke into your house,

1248
02:24:29,460 --> 02:24:31,520
You saved this village's honour.

1249
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:35,820
Mine's nothing compared to what you have done.

1250
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:38,520
Ayyu.

1251
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:42,880
To secretly take revenge on your father,

1252
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:47,180
I joined their group and did a lot of injustice to you.

1253
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:52,860
Leave it, Uncle.

1254
02:24:53,620 --> 02:24:55,480
There's no man who hasn't done any wrong.

1255
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:03,880
I didn't realise that you were so broad minded.

1256
02:25:04,980 --> 02:25:07,000
Only after Girija made me understand,

1257
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:08,600
I too became a human.

1258
02:25:09,420 --> 02:25:12,460
A man cannot live separated from society.

1259
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:14,720
It's paradise when we live together.

1260
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:17,120
Yes, sir. Take this.

1261
02:25:17,400 --> 02:25:20,100
All the things that we looted from your house.

1262
02:25:20,340 --> 02:25:21,500
They've brought everything.

1263
02:25:34,740 --> 02:25:35,980
Sir.

1264
02:25:37,860 --> 02:25:40,460
Everybody's bringing back everything they took.

1265
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:45,420
But I can't bring back what I've taken.
What is it?

1266
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:47,420
Pickles.

1267
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:51,340
I drank pickles from Ayya's house like juice.

1268
02:25:51,540 --> 02:25:53,380
How can I bring it back?

1269
02:25:53,380 --> 02:25:54,500
Sir?

1270
02:25:56,720 --> 02:25:58,620
Nobody shall give anything back.

1271
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:00,880
This belongs to you.

1272
02:26:01,660 --> 02:26:02,980
This is yours.

1273
02:26:03,460 --> 02:26:04,660
From now on.

1274
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:06,780
I'm not Boothayya's son Ayya.

1275
02:26:07,260 --> 02:26:09,040
Son of the village, Sambayya.

1276
02:26:09,240 --> 02:26:11,540
Please let me live amongst you.

1277
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:18,380
The eclipse that had fallen on our village is cleared today.

1278
02:26:18,780 --> 02:26:20,240
Come. Let's go.

1279
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:23,640
We shall continue the festival and seek the blessings of the goddess.

1280
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:24,860
Let's go.

1281
02:26:58,860 --> 02:27:02,600
It's paradise if we live together.
