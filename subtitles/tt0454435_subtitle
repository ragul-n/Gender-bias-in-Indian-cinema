1
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:01,701
'Company should begin with 'C'.'

2
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:05,167
'And why with 'D'?'

3
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,180
'Because the city of Mumbai
is not as straight. '

4
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:12,176
'Meaning.. '

5
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:15,185
'.. where's the air in here?'

6
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,353
'The waves of the sea
are not saline. '

7
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:24,357
'Nobody's flight.. '

8
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:28,391
'.. has any sort of guarantee. '

9
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:33,738
'And.. particularly.. '

10
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:37,202
'.. death in here.. '

11
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:40,205
'.. never arrives from south. '

12
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:45,208
'And this truth is known not
only to the learned.. '

13
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:48,550
'.. but also to these free
birds flying in the sky. '

14
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:53,384
'But.. they are oblivious to this.. '

15
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:59,565
'.. that in this city.. the sky
lies beneath the ground. '

16
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,566
'And in this straying city.. '

17
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:10,242
'.. one man.. '

18
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:14,236
'.. whether right or wrong.. '

19
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:16,645
'.. whether sin or virtue.. '

20
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:20,910
'.. he found his own
way among all this. '

21
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:27,420
'This man.. by his close friends.. '

22
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:30,428
'.. was lovingly called Deshu. '

23
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:34,263
'Deshu. '

24
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:37,531
'D for Deshu. '

25
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:44,269
'Let's see how his story began. '

26
00:02:44,444 --> 00:02:46,275
Deshu!

27
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,381
Where's father?

28
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:40,549
The poor man is on duty.. in Panvel.

29
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:43,786
He's there since past 2-3 days.

30
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,595
Used to remember you a lot.

31
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:03,412
Deshu! Coming to play?

32
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:07,576
C'mon, man! Fine!
- C'mon, pitch the ball!

33
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,432
Deshu.. when did you come?

34
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:25,434
Hey! Don't you have any
studies?! Go home!

35
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,103
It's my night. I'm going to Vasai.

36
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:29,436
Coming to meet your father?

37
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,604
Come to the headquarters.
There's a van.

38
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,464
Salutations, sir.

39
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:08,807
Come. Sit.

40
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:16,014
I sent him with a taxi
to receive you.

41
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:19,485
Did he arrive on time?

42
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:23,658
Kumud has sent something to eat.

43
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:27,662
What's the need to come
after four days?

44
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:30,492
Wastage of money.

45
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:36,500
Which hospital was she in?

46
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:41,503
What do you all think?!

47
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:43,505
I didn't make any efforts?!

48
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:46,508
Would you've treated her
more luxuriously?!

49
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:48,986
Would you've got her
admitted in Hinduja?!

50
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:50,920
Forget it, father. The imminent
thing happened.

51
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,924
How long will it take?
- No, it's almost done.

52
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:16,285
I don't know where he stays.
Ask someone else.

53
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,782
How long will you stay?

54
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:22,123
Will you be here till
the last rites?

55
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:26,129
You'll have to stay here till
the 12th and 13th day.

56
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,792
Let him eat.

57
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:31,962
Give him the gravy.
- Should I get it? - No.

58
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:37,803
What's the source of livelihood?

59
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:39,137
It's with the pension.

60
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:42,807
What else we're left with?

61
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,209
The house looks like a house since
she's here for four days..

62
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:48,344
.. or else I lie idle in the room.

63
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:52,357
This way? - This way!

64
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:53,824
Move. Move.

65
00:11:57,997 --> 00:12:00,022
Which house?!
- The green one! - The green one?!

66
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:01,157
Yes!

67
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,365
Hey, kill him! Kill him!
- Where is he?! - This way!

68
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:12,000
Move!

69
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:18,848
But these days the
heart pounds a lot.

70
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:21,386
That's why I'm scared.. since
you're alone in the room.

71
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:23,852
Look over there!
- I'll see here!

72
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,023
Come out! What the hell..
- Found him?!

73
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:28,855
There! The scum's running there!

74
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:30,859
Catch him!

75
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,390
Hey!
- Stop! - Hold him!

76
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:38,936
This has become a daily affair!
- Father.. - Hey!

77
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,200
Hey, come out!

78
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:44,402
Come out!

79
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:50,877
What is going on here?
- No! Don't kill me!

80
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:59,221
No!
- Here's he!

81
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:06,897
Pump him!

82
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:56,339
Greetings, sir.

83
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:58,109
I'm also in the police department.

84
00:13:58,417 --> 00:13:59,941
Bandra police station.

85
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:04,084
He's my son.
- Your son? - Yes.

86
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:05,283
So?!

87
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:06,948
What should I do?!

88
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:08,954
Shouldn't I conduct the inquiry?!
- Sir, I meant to say..

89
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:11,963
Stand aside! And let me do my work!

90
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:13,962
Move!

91
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:17,360
Hmm!

92
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:20,562
I saw that autopsy report!

93
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:25,433
But over there nobody
saw what happened.

94
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:33,480
In the house.. the old man..
the girl.. and you..

95
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:37,319
.. so why are you wasting
the time? Spill out fast.

96
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:41,983
Look, a crime has been committed.

97
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:47,189
And 'we' find it in a minute.
I mean the department.

98
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:50,996
But a witness is needed.

99
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:54,999
And its our responsibility to
parade those scum before you.

100
00:14:56,342 --> 00:14:58,003
You just have to identify them.

101
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:01,002
Just identify them.

102
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:12,076
Lord Shiva! Hail Lord Shiva!

103
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:22,087
This not your age to know all this!

104
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:26,428
Got it! A million tons of lumber
is cut in here!

105
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,559
But the blade never knows
which one is it going to cut!

106
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:31,431
Shouldn't say anything!

107
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:35,430
Just be tongue-tied! Be tongue tied!

108
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:43,642
Nobody among them!

109
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:12,477
I've straightened a lot many!
And you too will speak!

110
00:17:13,412 --> 00:17:15,607
Even your father's going
to speak, rascal!

111
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:19,617
I'll pull out your bowels and
spread them on the table!

112
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:22,153
Rascal!

113
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:29,160
Why didn't you identify?!

114
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:32,163
Why?!

115
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:34,692
Are they your mother's paramours?!

116
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,232
Speak up, son of a bitch! Speak up!

117
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:31,220
It's good that you're here!

118
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,225
That Hashimbhai's men came
looking for you!

119
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:37,218
They barged in the house!

120
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:41,393
And they have threatened me!

121
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:45,230
They summoned you!

122
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:47,235
Do one thing..

123
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:49,240
.. go to your village!

124
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:52,568
The police are nothing for them!

125
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:55,770
They consider everyone as cattle!

126
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:59,240
They don't have any regards
for a man's life!

127
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:03,248
Look..

128
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:07,248
.. there's no use if you stay here!

129
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,794
You've to leave this
place at any cost!

130
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:53,304
Got to meet Hashimbhaibhai.

131
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:55,504
Who are you?
- Deshu. He has summoned me.

132
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,309
Stand by the side.

133
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:00,368
Can't you wait for a minute?!

134
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:02,365
Come here and talk to me!

135
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:15,713
What do you do?

136
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:18,518
I was a mechanic in Dubai. But
doing nothing right now.

137
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:19,853
Why didn't you speak up?!

138
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:21,722
I've decided to enter this arena.

139
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:25,864
What will you do in this line?
- You need Mangli.

140
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,394
I can finish off Mangli.

141
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:31,927
Hey!

142
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:34,600
Are we pimps who're sitting
idle in here?!

143
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:38,409
You.. are gonna kill Mangli?

144
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:43,577
You seem to be quite fearless?

145
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:45,411
Can you reach Mangli?

146
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:48,613
Didn't I reach in here?

147
00:21:51,824 --> 00:21:53,815
I just want to ask..

148
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:55,826
.. is there any chance for
me to enter in this arena?

149
00:21:56,595 --> 00:21:59,428
Why didn't you go to Mangli
with the same offer?

150
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:01,759
Mangli is an animal.

151
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:06,430
Moreover, I want to
work for a long term.

152
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:08,770
And Mangli is not worth that.

153
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:10,772
This business is not that easy.

154
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:13,436
It's all about destiny.

155
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:15,443
I don't believe in destiny.

156
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,458
Raghav!

157
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:35,459
Get the boy whatever he wants.

158
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:41,735
When will you hit Mangli?
- The moment I get the chance.

159
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:50,638
This.. What's this?

160
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:51,807
Shabbir..

161
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:54,944
.. we'll gain if Mangli's killed..

162
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,649
.. and we don't stand to
lose if this boy departs.

163
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:04,692
Take care.. the building
is quite dilapidated.

164
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:06,958
I didn't get your idea.

165
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:09,899
Open it.. have you done anything
like this earlier?

166
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,705
What's up, Abdullah? The man's
like this since childhood.

167
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:17,901
Sit down. You'll get wearied
if you stand up.

168
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:20,035
Damn.. he has opened
up a barber's shop.

169
00:23:20,112 --> 00:23:22,046
Abha.. Hashimbhaibhai has said..

170
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:23,513
.. try understanding first.

171
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:27,518
Munna, open the cupboard.

172
00:23:27,686 --> 00:23:29,847
It was urgent. Tried the phone
but wasn't getting the line.

173
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:30,980
Why? What's up?

174
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:32,523
Is your grandma getting married?

175
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:33,851
Who's this new kid?

176
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:44,535
The gun was locked.

177
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:46,534
The kid has got something.

178
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:50,538
I've been through police
training earlier.

179
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:57,707
I've been with Hashimbhaibhai
for seven years.

180
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:04,545
But its for the first time that
I've seen him trust anybody so soon.

181
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:05,951
Am I right, Tarzan?

182
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:07,558
Brother, I'm just 2 and
half years old with him..

183
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:09,890
.. how could I know that?
- Dumbass.

184
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:14,555
You don't know Mangli. He's
an utter scoundrel.

185
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,027
Just don't know which bug bit him..

186
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:19,229
.. that he has messed
up with Hashimbhaibhai?

187
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:22,031
Shabbir, I and Muqram.. we
searched him everywhere..

188
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:24,041
.. but couldn't find him anywhere.

189
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:25,837
The man was killed in Bhiwandi.

190
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:27,845
Still there's no tip-off
of his whereabouts.

191
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:33,578
It's a matter of prestige in the
market! Get the beer fast!

192
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:37,919
After all where's this Mangli?!
He has to be found at any cost!

193
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:44,061
Tomorrow morning I'll get up..
and make use of some tricks..

194
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:45,596
.. we'll find him automatically.

195
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:48,596
I'll go alone.

196
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:53,997
Who?

197
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:56,870
Brother.. I met you once. I was
the witness in Murli's case.

198
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:59,775
Tell me what's the matter?
- Brother, I want to work with you.

199
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:01,877
Why should I employ you, rascal?!

200
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:04,939
Brother, you told me not to
tell anything to the police.

201
00:25:05,017 --> 00:25:06,609
Brother, didn't I keep mum?

202
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:08,616
Was it some kindness on
your part, rascal?!

203
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:10,950
Had you not shut your mouth there..

204
00:25:11,023 --> 00:25:12,149
.. then I would have
done that for you!

205
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:15,625
Brother.. the thing is..
Hashimbhai's men came to my house..

206
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:17,628
So?
- You've an influence over the city..

207
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:22,224
.. and if I work with you.. then
nobody will say anything to me.

208
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:24,232
Fine, fine. Don't eat my brains now.

209
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:28,171
Reach at Dadar station by 3. My
boys will pick you up. Got it?

210
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,639
Thank you, brother.
Thank you very much.

211
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:30,970
Now put the phone down!

212
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,641
Man, you seem to be a wiseass.

213
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:36,975
Is it that you're fooling us?
What time did he call you?

214
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:29,167
Should I stop her? Would
like to go with her?

215
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:33,163
What's the shy thing among friends?
It's all about half an hour.

216
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:37,038
Pretending decent.
- No, buddy.

217
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:45,215
You should be enjoying everything.

218
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:47,047
But quality should
be the preference.

219
00:26:49,221 --> 00:26:50,313
Here.

220
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:52,884
My rummy is up. Here.

221
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:57,727
Isn't it?

222
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,993
It's 2:30.. seems the
boss won't come now.

223
00:27:00,065 --> 00:27:01,225
Let's sleep, buddy.

224
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,736
Make merry at the right time.
And do work on the right time.

225
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:25,748
Why are you so scared?!

226
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:27,752
Why are you dying to meet me?

227
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:31,024
They are after my life.

228
00:27:31,096 --> 00:27:32,757
So?! What should I do?!

229
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:35,290
Do you think I've started
an orphanage in here?!

230
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:39,929
What will I gain by rearing
up someone like you?!

231
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,168
Go and order for tea!
Bring it yourself!

232
00:27:56,321 --> 00:27:57,788
Who'll light it? Your father?!

233
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:00,955
This boy's quite a bit!

234
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:33,017
Where are you going?

235
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:34,422
The brother ordered for
tea and it has not come?

236
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:36,085
What the hell man?!
Get the tea fast!

237
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:39,828
And where's the cigarette?
- It's lying in the car.

238
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:41,160
I'll get it.
- Hey..

239
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:42,325
No, I'll get it.

240
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:49,838
Run!
- Get the bastard!

241
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:52,035
Hit them!

242
00:28:54,012 --> 00:28:55,172
Hey, where're you running away, scum?

243
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:03,848
No, no!

244
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:08,859
No!
- Kill him!

245
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,031
Mangli's gang is finished..

246
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,862
.. now what should we do
with this Kunal Qureishi?

247
00:29:20,138 --> 00:29:21,867
If Kunal Qureishi gets money..

248
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,875
.. then he'll not desist
to sell even his mother.

249
00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:27,268
What has he got to do with Mangli?

250
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:35,881
You were fortunate..
that you got away.

251
00:29:36,054 --> 00:29:37,214
Hmm?

252
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,415
Or else.. he would have sliced
you with a shaver..

253
00:29:41,493 --> 00:29:43,484
.. and tortured you by
rubbing salt all over.

254
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:45,893
The rascal.

255
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:56,967
In our trade..

256
00:30:57,035 --> 00:30:58,969
.. everyone gets an entry..

257
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,974
.. but sustaining in here..

258
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:07,978
Here's the key.

259
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,480
Raghav will show you the flat.

260
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:12,973
Go, Raghav.

261
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:22,588
She's going all decked up!

262
00:31:23,395 --> 00:31:27,991
The beads in the anklets
around your ankles..

263
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:31,524
.. makes my mind crazy
as it jingles.

264
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:33,332
Will you make us sit in
the balcony or the stall?

265
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:36,333
Come, Deshu.. have a seat

266
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:40,276
She moves all decked up!
She moves all decked up!

267
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:43,010
Let the impending..

268
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:44,343
.. happen today..
- Bring it.

269
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:46,350
Crispy notes.. want to fling some?

270
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:49,546
You seem to be very shy.
Everything's ours, my friend.

271
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:52,012
Hey, fatso! You've thrown
a lot of notes!

272
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,024
Now sit down or else
you'll take a bullet!

273
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,021
My dear!

274
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:00,027
Move!

275
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:06,036
Hey! Come here!

276
00:32:07,572 --> 00:32:11,201
Deshu.. she's Gunjan.. my babe.

277
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:13,038
Speak low.. why are you shouting?

278
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:16,370
Gunjan.. this Deshu..
he's very dangerous.

279
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,042
Rather you're dangerous.

280
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:23,210
Your liver shall rot one day
if you keep drinking like this.

281
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:26,186
She worries a lot about me. A lot.

282
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:28,385
Who else will worry about you? Is
there anyone else to take care?!

283
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:34,460
When do I say you not to drink..
but at least there should be a limit.

284
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:39,060
Indeed she should worry.. after
all we're getting married.

285
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:42,470
Marriage! - Who the hell will marry
you? - Who will marry me!?

286
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,533
When I enter in the bar..
do you see the other girls?

287
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:49,603
Fifteen girls stare me at one go.
- Get lost.

288
00:32:49,681 --> 00:32:51,615
Have you seen your face?
- Yes, I've.

289
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,081
C'mon, Deshu.

290
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:59,248
By the way.. I don't look that ugly.

291
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:03,256
I'll look just like Shahrukh
Khan if I get a shave.

292
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:13,269
Hey, Deshu.. how did
you find my Gunjan?

293
00:33:14,572 --> 00:33:16,096
Tell me the truth.

294
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:20,104
I told her a lot many times
to leave this dancing job..

295
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:24,114
.. but the damn girl is
so happy with her job..

296
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:27,174
.. just like we're happy with ours.

297
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:52,142
Gunjan will come home?

298
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:54,136
She'll.

299
00:33:56,648 --> 00:34:00,140
Hashimbhaibhai.. I feel this thing
should be started in Chembur.

300
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:03,148
He's gone crazy. Seems he's
drunk in the morning.

301
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:04,745
Nobody is touching that area.

302
00:34:04,823 --> 00:34:06,154
That area belongs to Shankar Yadav.

303
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,150
His name isn't engraved there.

304
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:12,152
Father.. explain him..

305
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,492
Shabbir!

306
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:17,160
Deshu had told me earlier
about Chembur.

307
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:18,361
Hey..

308
00:34:18,436 --> 00:34:20,233
.. sometime or the other we've
to make this move, isn't it?

309
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:22,568
But, father, we've committed
this mistake once earlier..

310
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,369
I'm just concerned with the profit.

311
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:28,339
If there's no profit.. then
I'll catch hold of his neck.

312
00:34:28,513 --> 00:34:29,571
Isn't it, uncle?

313
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:34,677
I'll need some new
boys for this job.

314
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:37,787
Fine. But select the boys carefully.

315
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:41,384
Father..

316
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:43,518
.. such a big responsibility..

317
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:46,188
.. on this new guy?

318
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:47,390
Look, son..

319
00:34:47,465 --> 00:34:50,195
.. if has got the guts to shoulder
the responsibility..

320
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:53,201
.. then we should have the guts
to entrust him with it.

321
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:58,399
There's a first go in everything.

322
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:02,536
But.. it's risky, man.

323
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:05,215
Risk lies even in crossing the road.

324
00:35:06,618 --> 00:35:09,280
You earn whatever after slogging
for whole your life..

325
00:35:09,354 --> 00:35:11,549
.. what's wrong if you earn
the same in one year?

326
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:13,383
But, why are you choosing us only?

327
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:16,553
We don't even have any experience.

328
00:35:16,728 --> 00:35:20,562
No experience.. but daring
is needed in this line.

329
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:22,222
But.. who'll teach us?

330
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,564
I'm there. Raghav's there.

331
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:27,738
Moreover you'll not be working
for some insignificant man.

332
00:35:37,248 --> 00:35:39,239
What's the guarantee of these guys?

333
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:42,249
They are all new.

334
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,251
Won't they betray?

335
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:47,254
I can't give that guarantee.

336
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:49,256
But I can give this guarantee that..

337
00:35:49,327 --> 00:35:51,261
.. the one who betrays..

338
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:53,593
.. will never be left alive.

339
00:35:57,435 --> 00:35:58,527
No, madam, not in that rate.

340
00:35:58,603 --> 00:36:00,264
Is it original?
- Yes, it is.

341
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:02,272
But at least..
- I said no, madam.

342
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,672
Is it absolute original? - Yes,
absolute original. - No, madam.

343
00:36:05,877 --> 00:36:09,278
You find such a thing in the whole
market. It's fixed rate, sir.

344
00:36:09,614 --> 00:36:12,276
Which is Khimjibhai's shop?
- It's over there, sir.

345
00:36:15,453 --> 00:36:16,818
Khimjibhai..
- Yes?

346
00:36:16,888 --> 00:36:18,287
Your stuff has come outside.

347
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:19,482
One minute, huh?

348
00:36:19,557 --> 00:36:20,683
Chhotu..

349
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:22,282
C'mon, make it fast.

350
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:31,458
This market is great, man.
Everything's imported in here.

351
00:36:32,637 --> 00:36:34,298
Hey! Bastard!

352
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:36,303
You know whose area is this?
- What happened, brother?

353
00:36:36,374 --> 00:36:37,966
You know it, don't you?
- How come you touched me?!

354
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:39,771
How come you're here then?!
- Hey! Get lost from here!

355
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:42,304
I don't want any of you people here!

356
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,844
Don't you know.. that I
don't want anyone here?!

357
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,781
Listen you.. - Go and tell
that.. - Listen to me..

358
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:49,718
Don't keep blabbering. - Tell
that Pathan that it's my area!

359
00:36:49,787 --> 00:36:51,311
I don't want any bastard in here!

360
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:52,649
We've come here for business.

361
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:55,488
Don't show me your eyes!
- Is it your father's area?!

362
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:57,720
Yes, it's my father's area?! Should
I show you how?! - Show me!

363
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,333
Get lost!
- Prick!

364
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:25,352
The show's up. C'mon, move.

365
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:39,698
Shankarbhai! Shankarbhai!

366
00:37:40,438 --> 00:37:41,700
They shot me in the leg!

367
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,833
Before I could take out my weapon..
they shot me in the leg!

368
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:46,843
Why didn't you bump them off?!
- Don't spare him, Brother.

369
00:37:46,911 --> 00:37:48,640
He's bleeding a lot.
Take him to hospital!

370
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:49,975
Don't spare him!

371
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:52,642
Hashimbhai.. you motherfu..

372
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:56,386
Hey, gather all the boys!

373
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:59,383
He never dared to
enter into my area!

374
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:01,388
Who's this new guy?!

375
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:12,661
Look over there!
- Look in the corner!

376
00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:17,401
What the hell are you looking?!
- Not here! - There?! - Then where?!

377
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:21,408
Not here as well!

378
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:23,576
Where might they be?!
- Not here also!

379
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:27,744
Not here. - Hey!

380
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:45,764
C'mon.. the bastard has ran away!

381
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,440
I've gone nowhere.
- Hey!

382
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:58,776
If a single bullet is fired at me..

383
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,445
.. then your skull will be filled
with so many bullets..

384
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,980
.. there won't be enough
space for your brains.

385
00:39:21,873 --> 00:39:23,807
I'm willing to die for
the sake of business.

386
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:32,874
But are you willing die just
for the sake of hitting me?

387
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:41,884
I have got a plan.

388
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,498
Want to work with me..

389
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:54,003
.. or just want to die?

390
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:03,005
Life is simply survival.

391
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:11,512
Life is simply survival.

392
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:16,854
Add some meaning to life.

393
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:29,532
Life is simply survival.

394
00:40:29,707 --> 00:40:33,871
Add some meaning to life.

395
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:23,590
Why are you screwing me?

396
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:24,923
Go and talk to Hashimbhaibhai.

397
00:41:24,996 --> 00:41:27,931
He has himself permitted
those guys in the gang.

398
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:30,600
Moreover, it's good.

399
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:32,135
Our gang is getting empowered.

400
00:41:32,203 --> 00:41:34,763
Hey.. will our gang be empowered
with such pests?

401
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:36,134
I'm telling you, Muqram..
these boys..

402
00:41:36,207 --> 00:41:38,198
.. have expanded the business
manifold in the past two months.

403
00:41:38,276 --> 00:41:41,609
Fine! Fine! Move!
- Move, now!

404
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,943
Go and have tea. Get lost.

405
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:49,953
You'll have to be careful
of these two brothers.

406
00:41:52,123 --> 00:41:54,956
They try biting like wild
dogs at every instance.

407
00:41:57,028 --> 00:41:58,791
Furthermore, none can
say anything to them.

408
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,964
After all they are
Hashimbhai's sons.

409
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:03,630
And we're orphans.

410
00:42:03,701 --> 00:42:05,965
We do all the dirty work..

411
00:42:06,037 --> 00:42:10,030
.. and it's them who
have all the joy.

412
00:42:11,042 --> 00:42:12,634
One is lame.. and the other is..

413
00:42:13,144 --> 00:42:15,635
Sometimes I think that even
Hashimbhaibhai doesn't know..

414
00:42:15,713 --> 00:42:17,977
.. that he's the father of such
useless and worthless sons.

415
00:42:18,149 --> 00:42:19,639
Hashimbhaibhai doesn't understand.

416
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:21,048
These rascals will ruin
the whole gang.

417
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:22,642
Hashimbhaibhai knows everything.

418
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:25,650
Or else you and I would never
have been in the gang.

419
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:31,661
Hashimbhaibhai, you might remember..

420
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:33,856
.. I had once talked about a
builder in Bhandup. - Yes.

421
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:35,660
In his construction
company there's a..

422
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:37,667
Come in. Come in, sir Gangaram.

423
00:42:38,836 --> 00:42:40,667
Please come in.

424
00:42:44,141 --> 00:42:47,269
Muqram.. Shabbir..

425
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,671
Come.. have a seat.

426
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:57,013
How are you?

427
00:42:57,088 --> 00:43:02,082
Just don't ask anything. This back
pain is ever increasing.

428
00:43:03,094 --> 00:43:06,188
You tell me.. is everything
fine in Gujarat?

429
00:43:06,764 --> 00:43:10,962
It's perfectly alright..
by your blessings.

430
00:43:11,035 --> 00:43:12,093
No.

431
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:13,898
Because of his blessings.

432
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:18,698
Is it?

433
00:43:19,977 --> 00:43:22,104
So.. he's..

434
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:25,043
.. Deshu?

435
00:43:27,118 --> 00:43:31,885
I've heard a lot about you,
son. I've heard a lot.

436
00:43:34,058 --> 00:43:38,119
You've indeed done a great job.
- He's the star of my gang.

437
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:47,737
He'll see a lot of success.

438
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:52,066
What will you have?

439
00:43:52,243 --> 00:43:53,733
Tea or cold drinks?
- Whatever you wish.

440
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:55,745
Get the tea!

441
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:00,747
Come, Sharma. Come.

442
00:44:00,918 --> 00:44:03,910
Minting a lot of money. You've
grown a paunch as well.

443
00:44:05,022 --> 00:44:06,284
Deshu.. do you know him?

444
00:44:06,357 --> 00:44:08,086
You know that heroine..
that Bhakti Bhatnagar..

445
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:09,285
The one who acted in 'Pyar Ho Gaya'..

446
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,759
.. she's a great piece, man..

447
00:44:10,828 --> 00:44:12,762
.. these days her item songs are
quite popular on television..

448
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:14,297
.. he's her secretary Sharma.

449
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:16,925
Sharma don't be shy. Have a seat.

450
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:18,763
Tea, cold drinks or anything else?
- It's okay.

451
00:44:19,103 --> 00:44:24,097
This Aslam Khan is forcing himself
upon Bhakti baby, sir.

452
00:44:24,275 --> 00:44:26,766
His uncouth behavior has
multiplied for the worse.

453
00:44:26,844 --> 00:44:29,108
And he just crossed the limit
during the current schedule.

454
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,772
He dared to touch her breasts.

455
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:35,779
And he never listens to anybody.

456
00:44:35,953 --> 00:44:37,784
Instead he threatens all.

457
00:44:39,123 --> 00:44:41,114
We're scared of going
to the police..

458
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:44,953
.. because baby will be defamed..

459
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:47,963
.. her career will be finished.

460
00:44:48,265 --> 00:44:50,290
Nobody can say him anything.

461
00:44:50,368 --> 00:44:52,063
After all he's a big star.

462
00:45:21,165 --> 00:45:23,292
Want to get beaten up
here or in privacy?

463
00:45:25,002 --> 00:45:27,436
No, brother Deshu! No!

464
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:29,835
Brother Deshu! I committed a folly!

465
00:45:30,307 --> 00:45:32,832
I committed a folly, brother Deshu!

466
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:35,240
Brother Deshu! No!

467
00:45:35,312 --> 00:45:37,837
Sir.. your shot is ready.
- Go! Go from here!

468
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:39,241
Brother Deshu!

469
00:45:39,316 --> 00:45:43,912
I committed a folly! Forgive
me, brother Deshu!

470
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:45,181
Thanks.

471
00:45:53,397 --> 00:45:57,197
What will you have?
- No I.. don't drink.

472
00:46:50,454 --> 00:46:53,252
The layman's view..

473
00:46:53,324 --> 00:46:55,918
.. is quite constrained
about the underworld.

474
00:46:57,094 --> 00:46:58,322
Work is work after all.

475
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,921
Some are doctors.. some
engineers..

476
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,924
.. I'm a gangster.

477
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:09,931
But don't you feel that you..

478
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,968
Who's there in your house?

479
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:45,301
I've left my home.

480
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:56,144
Now I feel that all the girls will
get scared of me. - But, I don't.

481
00:48:06,397 --> 00:48:08,592
Ma'am.. autograph please?
- Sure.

482
00:48:12,403 --> 00:48:13,995
Tell me.

483
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:29,212
Yes, tell me!

484
00:49:06,657 --> 00:49:08,056
The bastard..

485
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:09,251
Brother!

486
00:49:09,326 --> 00:49:11,317
Brother! Listen..

487
00:49:11,729 --> 00:49:14,061
What's the matter?
- Did you hear the latest?

488
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:16,597
What is it? - The scum has
won over Bhakti Bhatnagar.

489
00:49:27,244 --> 00:49:28,404
Hey! Hey!

490
00:49:28,479 --> 00:49:30,674
Oh God! Everyone's in here!

491
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:38,080
Uncle!
- Sir Tambe!

492
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:40,480
Is brother Shabbir in there?
- Yes of course. - Let's go. - Come.

493
00:49:40,557 --> 00:49:42,081
Upstairs?
- Yes, upstairs.

494
00:49:44,361 --> 00:49:46,420
Brother Shabbir!
- Hey!

495
00:49:46,497 --> 00:49:48,089
Sir Tambe!

496
00:49:48,165 --> 00:49:52,101
How are you doing?
- Quite okay.

497
00:49:52,169 --> 00:49:54,160
What's up? You don't pick
the phone these days?

498
00:49:54,238 --> 00:49:57,264
Well..
- Hey! Sir Tambe!

499
00:49:57,341 --> 00:49:58,569
Sir Tambe!

500
00:50:01,512 --> 00:50:03,104
He's my elder brother.

501
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,375
And he.. my elder brother's elder.

502
00:50:05,449 --> 00:50:07,110
And this..

503
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:12,448
One minute.

504
00:50:13,524 --> 00:50:15,116
It's the election period.

505
00:50:16,527 --> 00:50:18,119
Everybody is terrified
in the party..

506
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:20,459
.. with their hearts pressed tight.

507
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:24,126
Sir Tambe.. don't worry
about the elections.

508
00:50:25,135 --> 00:50:26,534
Consider you've won them.

509
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:28,127
Should I call for the
sweets if you say so?

510
00:50:28,205 --> 00:50:30,730
Brother Shabbir, but what
about that Jaiswal?

511
00:50:30,808 --> 00:50:32,298
That Jaiswal's mother..

512
00:50:33,544 --> 00:50:36,138
Muku.. talking about Jaiswal!

513
00:50:36,313 --> 00:50:38,611
What's he?! Who the hell
is that Jaiswal?!

514
00:50:38,682 --> 00:50:40,149
Sir Tambe, you're simply..

515
00:50:40,217 --> 00:50:42,481
.. look there's so much light..
the party's in swing..

516
00:50:42,553 --> 00:50:44,316
.. and there's the booze..
look here who's this.

517
00:50:44,555 --> 00:50:45,681
Top star.

518
00:50:46,323 --> 00:50:48,154
I'll make a film with her.

519
00:50:48,225 --> 00:50:50,625
That bitch Bhakti Bhatnagar..

520
00:50:50,694 --> 00:50:53,162
Hey! Make happy! Make happy! Go!

521
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,164
Get sir Tambe's peg!

522
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:57,493
Tambe!

523
00:50:57,568 --> 00:51:01,163
So should I now be carefree
at your assurances.

524
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:03,169
You've indeed got our support.

525
00:51:03,574 --> 00:51:05,166
Cheers!
- Cheers.

526
00:51:06,343 --> 00:51:08,174
Go! Make happy!

527
00:51:08,245 --> 00:51:10,179
It would be foolhardy
to support Tambe.

528
00:51:10,247 --> 00:51:12,181
Hey! New bride.. Stay
in your limits!

529
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:15,181
Have you gone crazy?!

530
00:51:15,352 --> 00:51:17,320
Or else you're in the habit
of meddling in everything?!

531
00:51:17,388 --> 00:51:19,185
Listen to him first!

532
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:23,191
Brother.. we won't gain anything
by supporting Tambe.

533
00:51:23,727 --> 00:51:25,194
I've checked him and ours
previous record..

534
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:27,253
.. and he has done nothing
worthwhile..

535
00:51:27,364 --> 00:51:29,195
What has he done for us
in the past three years?

536
00:51:29,266 --> 00:51:31,200
We've always been solving
his problem.

537
00:51:31,268 --> 00:51:34,601
But if we support Jaiswal.. then we
stand to gain much. - Jaiswal?!

538
00:51:35,472 --> 00:51:37,269
Who the hell is Jaiswal?!

539
00:51:37,374 --> 00:51:39,365
Who knows that Jaiswal?!

540
00:51:39,743 --> 00:51:41,404
Even his electoral deposit
will be forfeited!

541
00:51:41,478 --> 00:51:42,536
I'm warning you!

542
00:51:45,616 --> 00:51:46,742
I'll take his guarantee.

543
00:51:46,817 --> 00:51:48,751
I've read his party's policy.

544
00:51:48,819 --> 00:51:50,753
And it'll benefit our business.
- Hey!

545
00:51:51,221 --> 00:51:53,746
To hell with the policy!
- Deshu is right.

546
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:56,723
Father.. - Then what should
we do about Tambe?!

547
00:51:57,694 --> 00:51:59,218
He's our friend!

548
00:52:01,632 --> 00:52:03,293
A friend is a foe in business.

549
00:52:03,767 --> 00:52:06,395
Are we rubbish people
seated in here?!

550
00:52:06,503 --> 00:52:07,765
Sir Tambe.. listen to..

551
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:10,830
What the hell are you
babbling, sir Tambe?!

552
00:52:11,308 --> 00:52:12,707
There's very less time
for the elections.

553
00:52:12,776 --> 00:52:14,573
What great thing have you done?!
- It was that Deshu who jumped..

554
00:52:14,645 --> 00:52:16,237
.. the track and it's us
who're bearing the brunt!

555
00:52:16,313 --> 00:52:18,247
If you didn't had the guts..

556
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:20,249
.. then what was the need
for you to talk big?!

557
00:52:20,317 --> 00:52:23,844
That Deshu is seated near my
father! - Forget all that!

558
00:52:23,921 --> 00:52:27,254
I think there's no one who listens
to you in your gang!

559
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:29,724
For a few.. - Do you know
who's running your gang?!

560
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:32,762
That new kid Deshu!
- That's enough, sir Tambe.

561
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,264
You roach! Just shut up!

562
00:52:35,432 --> 00:52:39,266
At least go and ask someone.
Better go and ask someone.

563
00:52:39,336 --> 00:52:42,271
Kid.. your time's up now!

564
00:52:42,439 --> 00:52:45,431
Tambe! - You gang is controlled
by that new guy Deshu!

565
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:47,271
Go and lick the shoes of that Deshu!

566
00:52:47,344 --> 00:52:48,743
Go, you cripple.. go
and lick his shoes!

567
00:52:48,812 --> 00:52:50,279
You rascal!

568
00:52:53,813 --> 00:52:55,610
Tell Qureshi that Tambe has come.

569
00:52:55,682 --> 00:53:01,348
Babban, what if
you killed fifteen?

570
00:53:02,822 --> 00:53:07,156
Do one thing, Babban.
Kill ten more.

571
00:53:08,328 --> 00:53:10,819
Then you can celebrate
your silver jubilee.

572
00:53:12,499 --> 00:53:14,831
The govt. will beg you
to surrender yourself.

573
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:22,506
Babban, I'll talk to you later.
A guest has come. A guest!

574
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:24,839
Did you understand?

575
00:53:27,514 --> 00:53:31,177
He's lost 15 lakhs, Naru. He
wants more. Shall I give?

576
00:53:31,251 --> 00:53:34,186
When did he say he'll return?
- In 8 days. Will you talk to him?

577
00:53:34,254 --> 00:53:38,315
Give it to him. Give it to him. But
take the documents of his house.

578
00:53:38,391 --> 00:53:40,188
Ok.

579
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,194
Brother Tambe!
- Brother Qureshi!

580
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:44,196
You've come after a long
time. It was Babban..

581
00:53:44,264 --> 00:53:45,526
.. he was getting on my nerves.
- Ok. Ok.

582
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:48,192
But I guess you've come
due to a reason.

583
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:50,862
Send some tea for Tambe.

584
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:56,532
Qureshi, you also compete
in the elections.

585
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:59,874
There's a lot of money in it.
- Don't teach me about elections.

586
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:05,543
I know about it. I've an open
offer. I just want you to agree.

587
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:10,555
The area should be mine, once. I've
to win the election that's all.

588
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,411
You just prepare for the elections.

589
00:54:35,749 --> 00:54:38,912
I'll take care of everything else.
I'll take care of it.

590
00:54:39,919 --> 00:54:41,750
Qureshi, what will we
do about that Jaiswal?

591
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:43,584
Why fear when I'm here?

592
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:45,920
Consider you've
won. You've won.

593
00:54:46,259 --> 00:54:51,595
That's ok, Jaiswal. We'll
take care of the elections.

594
00:54:52,766 --> 00:54:56,930
But after winning the elections,
you've to take care of us.

595
00:54:59,939 --> 00:55:03,932
Deshu, my brother. Whatever
you wish.. will be done.

596
00:55:04,444 --> 00:55:07,607
Don't worry about it. Greetings!

597
00:55:08,615 --> 00:55:12,449
Brother!
- Welcome, Jaiswal. Congratulations!

598
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:14,282
Congratulations to you
as well, brother.

599
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:16,948
Even I didn't expect you
to win by so many votes.

600
00:55:17,624 --> 00:55:19,785
Even I didn't expect that.
- Here, have some sweets.

601
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:21,622
No. I'm not supposed to eat sweets.

602
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:24,629
My victory was due to his mercy.

603
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:27,325
He so easily cleared Tambe's
men from Dombivali.

604
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,960
You've to do something
easily for us now.

605
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:31,298
Yes?
- Here, eat what the minister gave.

606
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:33,635
Here, minister, have some sweets.

607
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:35,765
What happened? Eat these sweets.

608
00:55:37,644 --> 00:55:39,635
Ok. Ok. Ok.

609
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:46,644
Hashimbhai, you can carry on with
your business in our area..

610
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:51,713
.. for the next five years. There
isn't anyone to stop you.

611
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,725
I've given orders
to knock off Deshu.

612
00:55:53,793 --> 00:55:56,819
Even I can give those orders.
But the job should be done.

613
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:59,763
There are too many people with
that Deshu all the time.

614
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:01,664
That too with arms.

615
00:56:01,935 --> 00:56:04,836
Even big shots are killed
by my people.

616
00:56:04,904 --> 00:56:07,372
Yes. That's true.
- What's this Deshu then?

617
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,001
Have you ordered Babban?
- Not Babban, I've told Razzaq.

618
00:56:11,678 --> 00:56:14,670
Who's Razzaq?
- That policeman.

619
00:56:17,016 --> 00:56:19,007
That encounter specialist?
- Yes.

620
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:26,022
Brother Qureshi, I'm in politics
but you're much ahead of me.

621
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,350
I've agreed to pay him 4 lakhs.
You've to pay that..

622
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:30,692
.. don't tell me to pay
that amount later.

623
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:33,493
Not 4, but I'll pay
8 if needed.

624
00:56:33,566 --> 00:56:35,363
It's about my life. Is
money greater than my life?

625
00:56:35,435 --> 00:56:37,528
The job should be done.
- Ok.

626
00:56:37,604 --> 00:56:39,697
Go home and sleep peacefully. Ok?

627
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,704
In a day or two, he'll be taken to
an isolated place in a van and..

628
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,371
Qureshi!

629
00:57:04,731 --> 00:57:06,892
Leave him.

630
00:57:15,909 --> 00:57:17,570
He has an affair with
actress Bhakti, sir.

631
00:57:17,911 --> 00:57:20,573
He keeps visiting her
house regularly, sir.

632
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:23,913
Why don't we pick him
up from there, sir?

633
00:57:30,757 --> 00:57:32,748
Qureshi is dead.

634
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,100
As far as I know, sir
Razzaq.. Qureshi..

635
00:57:43,603 --> 00:57:48,438
.. or Tambe weren't your uncles.

636
00:58:02,455 --> 00:58:04,446
Just keep an eye.

637
00:58:17,036 --> 00:58:19,470
We got a tip just now that Babban
Tikekar has come to Bombay.

638
00:58:22,809 --> 00:58:27,473
Don't take him lightly. He's
a very dangerous bastard.

639
00:58:28,815 --> 00:58:32,808
Kunal Qureshi was close to him.
He must have come to avenge him.

640
00:58:33,653 --> 00:58:39,819
Deshu! Babban, Deshu
has killed Qureshi.

641
00:58:41,494 --> 00:58:46,830
No. He's in our gang. But we
have nothing to do with him.

642
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:51,960
Ask. - Look, Babban. We don't have
any hand in the murder of Qureshi.

643
00:58:53,006 --> 00:58:54,837
If you don't believe
us then ask him.

644
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:57,171
Qureshi was killed by Deshu
right in front of his eyes.

645
00:58:57,243 --> 00:59:00,508
Why are you sitting quietly,
Tambe? Speak up!

646
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:07,510
Why did he spare you? - So that
I tell everyone that Deshu is..

647
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:10,147
.. a big daredevil! That's why!

648
00:59:11,858 --> 00:59:13,689
Do you have lime?

649
00:59:47,155 --> 00:59:52,149
Bhakti! - Yes? - I want to
do my business from London.

650
00:59:52,994 --> 00:59:55,053
From London? Why?

651
00:59:56,064 --> 00:59:58,498
All the black money here
turns white there.

652
01:00:03,504 --> 01:00:05,836
Anyway the business is carried
out over the phone.

653
01:00:07,442 --> 01:00:10,172
It doesn't matter whether I do
it from here or from there.

654
01:00:21,189 --> 01:00:23,248
Do you think of anything else
other than this, Deshu?

655
01:00:23,324 --> 01:00:25,849
You don't like movies. Music
doesn't interest you, too.

656
01:00:25,927 --> 01:00:29,090
There should be some entertainment
in life as well.

657
01:00:30,365 --> 01:00:33,334
I've my own private entertainment.
- What?

658
01:00:40,174 --> 01:00:43,871
A crime branch inspector..
- How did that crime take place?

659
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,507
.. he had beaten me up in the lockup.

660
01:00:50,551 --> 01:00:53,384
He didn't know that today..

661
01:00:58,393 --> 01:01:00,884
.. today.. he wonders when and..

662
01:01:00,962 --> 01:01:03,624
.. what I'm going to do to him.

663
01:01:09,237 --> 01:01:11,569
But I'm not doing anything.

664
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:18,573
This agony of his entertains me.

665
01:01:24,585 --> 01:01:25,916
You're a demon.

666
01:01:44,272 --> 01:01:45,603
Speak.

667
01:01:45,673 --> 01:01:48,608
Deshu, our Jaiswal..
- Yes. -.. somebody knocked him off.

668
01:01:53,281 --> 01:01:55,613
When?
- 5 minutes back.

669
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,970
Brother, I can't believe
that these..

670
01:02:27,048 --> 01:02:28,640
.. people don't have
any hand in this.

671
01:02:28,716 --> 01:02:31,549
You won't talk nonsense!
Have you gone mad!?

672
01:02:32,487 --> 01:02:34,978
Why will we get him killed?

673
01:02:35,223 --> 01:02:39,159
Look at the one sitting here.
It's his entire mistake.

674
01:02:39,227 --> 01:02:41,661
He rules by the gun.

675
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:45,665
And he's avenged Qureshi's
death. Babban did it.

676
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:47,667
And you people arranged
everything with Babban.

677
01:02:48,336 --> 01:02:49,997
And got Mr. Jaiswal killed.

678
01:02:50,071 --> 01:02:52,005
He was proving so beneficial
to our gang.

679
01:02:52,073 --> 01:02:59,343
Hey pimp! You've learnt to talk
eh? Is this your dad's gang?

680
01:03:00,348 --> 01:03:04,682
This is our gang.
- That's what we're saying.

681
01:03:05,186 --> 01:03:08,019
The one who's giving so much
revenue to your gang..

682
01:03:08,089 --> 01:03:11,684
Get lost! I've seen many people like
you who provide revenue.

683
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,351
And listen, you're
too hot-blooded eh?

684
01:03:14,429 --> 01:03:16,624
If so.. then why are you hiding
here like a dog?

685
01:03:16,697 --> 01:03:18,688
Be brave enough to get out.

686
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,034
No one will even give you money
for charity. Understand?

687
01:03:23,104 --> 01:03:25,038
Why don't you try and get out?

688
01:03:25,106 --> 01:03:27,040
You're here because of your father.

689
01:03:27,108 --> 01:03:31,306
I'll kill.. you motherfu..
- Shut up!

690
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,066
I'm putting an end to your
people's interference..

691
01:03:53,134 --> 01:03:55,398
.. in each other's job.

692
01:03:58,573 --> 01:04:02,407
Deshu! You and Raghav will look
after the business in..

693
01:04:02,477 --> 01:04:06,413
.. Gujarat now. Stay in
contact with Gangaram.

694
01:04:06,581 --> 01:04:11,746
Shabbir and Muqram, you'll take
care of the business here.

695
01:04:13,754 --> 01:04:16,245
Both of you will bring
the profits to me.

696
01:04:18,259 --> 01:04:22,355
I'll decide the share
and give it to you.

697
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:26,764
Do you understand? I don't
want any problems.

698
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:32,568
Deshu!
- Whatever you find right.

699
01:04:33,608 --> 01:04:37,271
Did you see, Deshu? Hashimbhai
showed his true colors.

700
01:04:37,445 --> 01:04:39,106
After all blood relations do matter.

701
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:42,115
He gave Bombay to his useless
sons and gave Gujarat..

702
01:04:42,183 --> 01:04:44,310
.. to us, who work day and night.

703
01:04:44,385 --> 01:04:47,786
Go to Gujarat eh!?
- He has his own compulsions.

704
01:04:47,855 --> 01:04:50,483
The business in Gujarat
is negligible.

705
01:04:50,558 --> 01:04:53,118
What about the plots
we've hatched here?

706
01:04:53,194 --> 01:04:55,788
What'll we do in Gujarat? Tell me.

707
01:04:57,298 --> 01:04:59,459
No job is inferior.

708
01:05:01,802 --> 01:05:03,793
The people who carry out
the job are inferior.

709
01:05:06,307 --> 01:05:08,468
Glad to meet you.

710
01:05:09,744 --> 01:05:11,803
But I don't want to meet you again.

711
01:05:12,313 --> 01:05:19,879
You've two options. You
can leave this city.

712
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:26,820
Or send this parcel
to the commissioner.

713
01:05:28,496 --> 01:05:32,398
You don't meet me nowadays.
- Tell him to meet me.

714
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:35,494
Business doesn't run only
on the power of the gun.

715
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:40,507
Whatever you'll do.. you'll seek
my permission before that.

716
01:05:41,175 --> 01:05:46,169
I'll talk to him. You're
not understanding.

717
01:05:51,852 --> 01:05:53,843
No one can make him understand.

718
01:05:54,855 --> 01:06:00,191
This life consists of a moment.
This joy consists of a moment.

719
01:06:00,261 --> 01:06:04,527
The path of each moment is such.

720
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:10,537
This life consists of a moment.
This joy consists of a moment.

721
01:06:10,605 --> 01:06:15,542
The path of each moment is such.

722
01:06:16,544 --> 01:06:20,878
This life consists of a moment.
This joy consists of a moment.

723
01:06:20,948 --> 01:06:26,887
The path of each moment is such.

724
01:07:02,923 --> 01:07:05,756
The crime that you've committed..

725
01:07:05,926 --> 01:07:11,592
.. must be hidden in some corner.

726
01:07:12,933 --> 01:07:21,602
The one who doesn't fear anything
will surely come up.

727
01:07:23,678 --> 01:07:28,775
This bond is your last.

728
01:07:28,849 --> 01:07:34,617
This helplessness is your last.

729
01:07:35,289 --> 01:07:39,453
This life consists of a moment.
This joy consists of a moment.

730
01:07:39,527 --> 01:07:43,964
The path of each moment is such.

731
01:07:44,465 --> 01:07:49,630
This life consists of a moment.
This joy consists of a moment.

732
01:07:49,704 --> 01:07:54,641
The path of each moment is such.

733
01:08:04,919 --> 01:08:08,320
Smoke arises from the body.

734
01:08:08,389 --> 01:08:14,658
You've set fire to
someone's house.

735
01:08:15,996 --> 01:08:18,829
What crime have you committed?

736
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:23,666
Has anyone's footsteps
been imprinted on sand?

737
01:08:23,738 --> 01:08:29,677
30 million. - No one generates
so much profit in Bombay.

738
01:08:30,344 --> 01:08:32,676
Isn't it, uncle?

739
01:08:33,347 --> 01:08:36,339
Very good, son. - Hashimbhai,
you should go to Gujarat.

740
01:08:36,417 --> 01:08:38,351
The atmosphere's nice over there.

741
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,010
How are you?

742
01:08:42,356 --> 01:08:46,520
I'm settled in life. Work during
the day. Liquor in the evening.

743
01:08:46,861 --> 01:08:49,659
And then her nonsense at night.

744
01:08:50,531 --> 01:08:52,692
Hey Deshu, make him see reason.

745
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:54,359
What'll he make me understand?

746
01:08:54,435 --> 01:08:56,369
He knows that it's of no use.

747
01:08:56,437 --> 01:08:59,372
He isn't a fool like you?

748
01:09:04,378 --> 01:09:05,709
Really?

749
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:09,042
Gunjan, don't do it
in front of everyone.

750
01:09:09,116 --> 01:09:10,378
What do I tell you, man?

751
01:09:10,451 --> 01:09:14,717
Everyone told me not
to fall in love.

752
01:09:14,789 --> 01:09:18,885
But what to do I lost
my heart to her.

753
01:09:18,959 --> 01:09:20,586
It seems as if I killed myself.

754
01:09:21,325 --> 01:09:23,486
Do you know, Deshu? I was saving
up money for the past..

755
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,551
.. 3 years for buying this bungalow.

756
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:28,662
How much did it cost?
- 50 million.

757
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:30,996
I've paid an advance
of Rs. 10 million.

758
01:10:25,356 --> 01:10:28,553
I've heard that actress Bhakti
has bought a new bungalow..

759
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:33,562
.. in Juhu and that Deshu
lives with her.

760
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:36,394
I'm not able to understand how
he managed to impress that..

761
01:10:36,467 --> 01:10:39,664
.. fair skinned belle. - His luck is..

762
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:43,734
Enough man! Everyone's
talking about Deshu.

763
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:47,741
He's stuck to everyone's mouth
like chewing tobacco. Deshu!

764
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:49,745
At least a few people
talk of us now.

765
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:52,075
If we remain idle like this
then even those people will..

766
01:10:52,149 --> 01:10:54,743
.. chant his name. Deshu!
Deshu! Deshu!

767
01:10:54,818 --> 01:10:57,343
He's being discussed in the
newspapers these days.

768
01:10:58,422 --> 01:11:00,083
He's being discussed right? One
day, his name will be removed..

769
01:11:00,157 --> 01:11:02,091
.. even from the telephone directory.

770
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,092
Hey! Massage properly!

771
01:11:06,096 --> 01:11:08,087
Why are you showing
your temper on him?

772
01:11:14,772 --> 01:11:19,641
Something has to be done. Otherwise
we'll remain like this.

773
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:25,772
Kothari! - Who's Kothari?
- He's an estate agent.

774
01:11:27,618 --> 01:11:29,108
He's the one who arranged the
deal for..

775
01:11:29,186 --> 01:11:30,517
.. Bhakti Bhatnagar's bungalow.

776
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:34,113
He's a good friend of mine.

777
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,130
And I've also heard that he's
bought a bungalow in Juhu..

778
01:11:46,203 --> 01:11:49,798
.. worth 50 million, in the
name of his heroine.

779
01:11:49,873 --> 01:11:52,808
And I had met Gangaram's man.

780
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:56,243
He was telling that he had made
a profit of 60 million in Gujarat.

781
01:11:57,147 --> 01:12:00,480
And how much did Deshu tell him?
- 30 million.

782
01:12:00,551 --> 01:12:03,486
And he was very happy.
- That's it.

783
01:12:03,554 --> 01:12:06,648
I had told him earlier itself,
not to feed a snake.

784
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:11,150
Now look, he's piercing the
plate in which he eats.

785
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:25,631
I'm tired of listening. Someone
or the other is saying.

786
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:28,837
Deshu and his men are
up to something.

787
01:12:29,546 --> 01:12:32,515
Father, I even doubt
Deshu's button men.

788
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:35,848
Those beggars roam around
in bikes these days.

789
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:40,187
Tell me something, father.
Is there any way in which..

790
01:12:40,257 --> 01:12:43,192
.. I can find out about what
happens to the money he..

791
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,751
.. earns in Gujarat. No. Means we've
to agree to what he says.

792
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:51,861
Uncle, who told you about
Deshu's bungalow.

793
01:12:52,202 --> 01:12:54,864
Kothari. He's an estate agent.

794
01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:56,200
Call him.

795
01:12:57,207 --> 01:12:59,869
It isn't my fault. I already
sold it at a loss.

796
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:04,207
He was your man so I couldn't
tell him anything.

797
01:13:04,715 --> 01:13:06,876
Did you see, father?

798
01:13:08,886 --> 01:13:11,878
Did you get the money?
- Yes. I got the money.

799
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:17,493
How much?
- Rs. 10 million, advance.

800
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:25,361
When? - A month ago. Deshu had
come to give it, himself.

801
01:13:27,471 --> 01:13:31,237
Shall I leave?
- Yes. - Thank you.

802
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:39,576
A bungalow in Juhu for that bitch,
that too with our money.

803
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:41,914
I had never thought
that he would do so.

804
01:13:45,422 --> 01:13:50,587
No! The phone's ringing,
he isn't picking it up.

805
01:13:52,596 --> 01:13:54,587
He purposely doesn't pick
up the phone when we call.

806
01:13:54,665 --> 01:13:56,929
Why? Why should he?

807
01:13:57,935 --> 01:13:59,425
He's too egoistic.

808
01:13:59,503 --> 01:14:04,270
This isn't the only problem.
Deshu has taken over the..

809
01:14:04,341 --> 01:14:12,271
.. entire business of Gujarat. The
clients aren't willing to talk to us.

810
01:14:12,349 --> 01:14:18,777
His boys don't respect us. He's
become so powerful in his area..

811
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:22,918
.. that I've a feeling he's planning
to form his own gang.

812
01:14:22,993 --> 01:14:24,790
Why won't he form his own gang?

813
01:14:25,629 --> 01:14:26,789
He's been given so much power.

814
01:14:26,863 --> 01:14:31,300
No! No, Mukku. He doesn't trust us.

815
01:14:31,969 --> 01:14:36,303
He'll ask Kothari. Even though
your family members are your..

816
01:14:36,373 --> 01:14:39,968
.. own and outsiders are
outsiders. But no!

817
01:14:41,979 --> 01:14:43,970
And his rogues they
used to bow to us..

818
01:14:44,047 --> 01:14:50,816
.. and these days, they stare at
me threateningly if I order them!

819
01:14:50,887 --> 01:14:54,323
We gain by the death of Mangli.
There's nothing to lose if this..

820
01:14:54,391 --> 01:14:57,485
.. fellow dies! What the hell!

821
01:15:00,664 --> 01:15:02,564
Enough is enough!

822
01:15:04,334 --> 01:15:10,569
You've to decide today.

823
01:15:10,641 --> 01:15:12,336
Father, I'll go and
knock off those two.

824
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:13,671
I'll knock them off!

825
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:19,005
Ok. Do as you wish.

826
01:15:21,518 --> 01:15:24,681
Everyday, you say that you
will buy a new house.

827
01:15:24,755 --> 01:15:27,019
Do you think I enjoy
doing all this work?

828
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:29,024
We'll get bungalows, servants,
and everything else.

829
01:15:29,526 --> 01:15:31,585
Yes, you've a free servant here.

830
01:15:31,662 --> 01:15:34,358
Let me enjoy life a little bit. Why
are you getting into my nerves..

831
01:15:34,431 --> 01:15:36,695
.. so early in the morning?
- Yes, good.

832
01:15:36,767 --> 01:15:38,701
You don't want to listen to me.

833
01:15:38,769 --> 01:15:40,361
Why are you washing
your face with water?

834
01:15:40,437 --> 01:15:44,703
Last night's liquor is still left.
Use that. You'll feel better.

835
01:15:44,775 --> 01:15:48,609
Is anything left? Is it there?
- You won't mend your ways.

836
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,911
Gunjan, open the door.
- I'm not opening it. You do it.

837
01:15:52,983 --> 01:15:55,975
I'll kill those drunkards. They
must've come..

838
01:15:56,053 --> 01:15:57,987
.. looking for a free breakfast.

839
01:15:58,055 --> 01:15:59,716
I don't want anything for breakfast.

840
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:02,486
Do you know what I want? A kiss.
- Get lost!

841
01:16:02,893 --> 01:16:05,384
How was it? Wasn't it
nice? I'm leaving.

842
01:16:05,462 --> 01:16:07,396
Where are you going with a shirt?

843
01:16:07,464 --> 01:16:09,056
At least take a bath!

844
01:16:12,803 --> 01:16:15,897
Wait a minute, pal!
I'm coming! Wait!

845
01:16:18,742 --> 01:16:20,733
I'll be late.

846
01:17:07,858 --> 01:17:10,452
You haven't lost your pride eh?

847
01:17:45,896 --> 01:17:47,488
How are you, Gunjan?

848
01:17:55,906 --> 01:17:57,498
I've killed him.

849
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:08,516
Leave me! Leave me!
- Gunjan!

850
01:18:08,585 --> 01:18:10,519
Leave me!

851
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:14,517
Leave me!

852
01:18:18,929 --> 01:18:20,521
Leave me!

853
01:18:29,873 --> 01:18:36,540
Leave me! Leave me!

854
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,540
Leave me, bastard!

855
01:19:24,995 --> 01:19:27,088
Tell me, Razzaq.

856
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:56,952
Any problem?

857
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:45,674
Look there.

858
01:22:06,823 --> 01:22:08,085
Kill him!

859
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:38,784
Come from that side
and nab that bastard!

860
01:22:39,989 --> 01:22:41,115
Deshu!

861
01:23:37,013 --> 01:23:38,241
What did Deshu do?!

862
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:43,114
What did Deshu do?! Tell me!

863
01:23:43,186 --> 01:23:46,849
Hashimbhai, you could've consulted
me once before taking such..

864
01:23:46,923 --> 01:23:49,858
.. a huge step.

865
01:23:49,926 --> 01:23:55,125
Tell me, when do we ask you? You
were busy making a deal in Dubai.

866
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:59,191
Calm down! Please calm down!

867
01:24:00,937 --> 01:24:02,871
When our corpses would've
been found then.. - Shut up!

868
01:24:02,939 --> 01:24:06,033
You want utter a single word!
Not even a single word!

869
01:24:12,048 --> 01:24:16,883
Hashimbhai, even you know how
useless your sons are.

870
01:24:18,354 --> 01:24:25,886
Why do you think that your business
has improved so well..

871
01:24:25,962 --> 01:24:31,901
.. these days? Because people
related to your business have..

872
01:24:31,968 --> 01:24:34,232
.. started trusting Deshu.

873
01:24:36,306 --> 01:24:44,236
If you and Deshu separate now then
half of the clients would vanish.

874
01:24:44,314 --> 01:24:50,310
Yes. You would be at a
loss and so will he be.

875
01:24:52,322 --> 01:24:57,919
Look, Hashimbhai. If you won't solve
this problem right now..

876
01:24:57,994 --> 01:25:07,392
.. then it'll become difficult for
me to do business with you as well.

877
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:10,462
Yes. It's your wish after that.

878
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:25,954
Hashimbhai, we should be more
considerate about our gains..

879
01:25:26,022 --> 01:25:30,482
.. than our enmity, in life.

880
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:40,459
I know very well what
has happened with you.

881
01:25:41,437 --> 01:25:44,372
Sometimes mistakes do happen
in a fit of fury, Deshu.

882
01:25:46,476 --> 01:25:50,310
That's why, son. Forget
what happened.

883
01:25:51,381 --> 01:25:53,975
I know it's easier said than done.

884
01:25:54,384 --> 01:25:59,151
But nurturing this enmity
isn't going to help anyone.

885
01:26:02,392 --> 01:26:05,259
Hashimbhai is ready to compromise.

886
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,341
We can pull off the deal
by sitting face to face.

887
01:26:27,517 --> 01:26:29,417
It'll do a lot of good
to both the sides.

888
01:26:29,485 --> 01:26:31,612
Otherwise this'll continue.

889
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:39,022
Son, don't you respect me?

890
01:26:43,533 --> 01:26:48,197
Ok. - Ok.

891
01:27:47,497 --> 01:27:53,367
Shabbir, Muqram and Deshu.

892
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:56,638
And we all have to be
in this business.

893
01:27:59,509 --> 01:28:04,276
That's why I'm telling you to
forget whatever happened.

894
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:09,448
Settle your accounts
from both sides.

895
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:16,122
Because from today we'll
be starting a new life..

896
01:28:16,192 --> 01:28:18,285
.. in a new manner.

897
01:28:21,197 --> 01:28:27,136
They're young. You've a
lot left to see in life.

898
01:28:28,304 --> 01:28:30,738
This problem
is minor. Forget it.

899
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:40,142
Shabbir! Muqram! What do you say?

900
01:28:48,324 --> 01:28:54,752
Hashimbhai?
- Deshu, what do you say?

901
01:29:17,587 --> 01:29:21,648
It's alright now, isn't it?

902
01:29:23,593 --> 01:29:26,357
Are you happy now? Then smile.

903
01:29:29,599 --> 01:29:31,191
I've made your son agree.

904
01:29:34,604 --> 01:29:37,732
Uncle, what are you waiting
for? Order tea for us.

905
01:29:37,807 --> 01:29:40,367
Why not? Just a minute.

906
01:29:41,277 --> 01:29:44,212
Get some tea, brother.

907
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:47,611
They're kids. They're bound
to make mistakes, forget it.

908
01:29:54,724 --> 01:29:57,557
Whatever he had done
he did for our good.

909
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:06,225
Don't worry for money. We'll
expand our business.

910
01:30:06,402 --> 01:30:09,235
We'll double it. Don't worry.

911
01:30:19,782 --> 01:30:22,250
Raghav's account has been cleared.

912
01:30:39,602 --> 01:30:41,763
What have you done!?
What have you done!?

913
01:30:44,674 --> 01:30:47,268
I came here to make peace.

914
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:53,272
And you've messed up everything.
You've messed up everything!

915
01:30:56,285 --> 01:31:01,882
You've broken my trust!
You've broken my trust!

916
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:03,789
You're a traitor!

917
01:32:13,896 --> 01:32:15,363
Amen.

918
01:32:18,968 --> 01:32:25,965
Babban, I want Deshu! Deshu!

919
01:32:28,778 --> 01:32:30,712
To hell with Gangaram and
to hell with my dad.

920
01:32:32,915 --> 01:32:34,712
I want Deshu.

921
01:32:34,917 --> 01:32:36,908
I'll pay you whatever
amount you ask for.

922
01:32:36,986 --> 01:32:39,386
Whatever you ask for.

923
01:32:40,556 --> 01:32:44,390
I just want Deshu.

924
01:32:47,563 --> 01:32:49,793
Come here. We'll arrange something.

925
01:32:50,933 --> 01:32:55,563
I beg you.

926
01:33:01,877 --> 01:33:07,406
Just once, handover
this Deshu to me.

927
01:33:09,819 --> 01:33:15,587
Dead or alive! But soon, that's all.

928
01:33:36,612 --> 01:33:38,944
Babban! Babban!

929
01:34:27,663 --> 01:34:29,494
Not only Babban..

930
01:34:41,043 --> 01:34:42,908
.. but Pydhonie's.. Your..

931
01:34:51,053 --> 01:34:52,520
.. Swami.

932
01:35:02,865 --> 01:35:03,923
Uncle.

933
01:35:07,937 --> 01:35:09,529
Your friend..

934
01:35:15,077 --> 01:35:16,544
.. Chandu.

935
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,547
Abdul.

936
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:24,549
Bhosle. Tyagi.

937
01:35:27,089 --> 01:35:28,556
Jagat.

938
01:35:29,058 --> 01:35:33,722
Only one man from your
gang is left.

939
01:35:39,068 --> 01:35:40,558
You.

940
01:35:57,987 --> 01:36:01,115
Stay there. I won't kill you.

941
01:36:04,093 --> 01:36:07,927
I hate you more than your sons.

942
01:36:14,003 --> 01:36:17,598
You can keep dreaming about killing
me for the rest of your life.

943
01:36:19,942 --> 01:36:22,604
And keep weeping over
your loss of power.

944
01:36:45,034 --> 01:36:49,801
He had told you. This
is his entertainment.

945
01:36:52,107 --> 01:36:55,804
No one knows what he'll
do, when and where.

946
01:36:58,147 --> 01:37:02,641
Maybe this is the reason why
the one who was lovingly..

947
01:37:02,718 --> 01:37:07,655
.. called Deshu, once.
Is now known as D.

948
01:37:09,925 --> 01:37:14,988
D. None could stop him.

949
01:37:17,066 --> 01:37:22,663
He made crime a business. He
covered politics with a veil.

950
01:37:23,339 --> 01:37:26,831
And brought underworld,
to the upper world.

951
01:37:28,077 --> 01:37:35,677
Even today, D-company's
greatest motto is..

952
01:37:35,751 --> 01:37:40,188
.. a friend in business is
nothing short of an enemy.
