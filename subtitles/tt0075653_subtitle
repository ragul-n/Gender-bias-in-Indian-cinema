1
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,477
On behalf of the Acharya
Vinayak Music School...

2
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:03,355
l see you off formally.

3
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:06,224
But don't think that...

4
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:10,654
you have all mastered
the knowledge of music.

5
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:15,798
Today is not the end but the
beginning of your learning process.

6
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,727
Now the devotion to
music is like life...

7
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:24,236
which is both as easy and
tough as life itself.

8
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:31,241
l pray that Maa Saraswati embodies
in you the concept that..

9
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:37,285
...life is music
and music is life.

10
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,985
God bless you.

11
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:03,509
Looks like no one has
come to receive you.

12
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,282
Guess they didn't get my letter.
- Yes.

13
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:08,016
Keep it in a tonga.
- Okay, Sir.

14
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:11,954
Keep it there.

15
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:16,026
We are in a queue, sir.
So please take the first tonga.

16
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:25,564
Porter! Keep your luggage
in this tonga.

17
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:26,929
Why are you jumping the queue?

18
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:28,968
Get lost!
- What do you mean?

19
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:32,607
Listen Manglu, don't you
blame me afterwards.

20
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:35,641
lf you touch this suitcase,
l'll break your teeth...

21
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:36,939
and shove them
in your stomach.

22
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,545
You are an insolent man.
lt's his turn, after all.

23
00:05:39,852 --> 00:05:42,912
Look at how he is behaving, sir;
throwing his weight around.

24
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:46,350
lf l raise my hands, you'll
go flying from here.

25
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:47,858
Me?
- Yes, you.

26
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:49,628
Who me?

27
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:51,157
Hold on a minute.

28
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:52,398
Keep the luggage in his cart.

29
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,165
You're taking up for him, too,
young master.

30
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:58,671
Young master ?!

31
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:05,835
You are Ganesh!

32
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:10,514
Yes, l'm Ganesh.
Dheeruji's son, Ganesh.

33
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:12,045
You have grown quite tall.

34
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:15,579
l could say the same about you.

35
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:19,153
l'd have to stand on the ladder
to reach your height.

36
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:23,059
Forgive me, Manglu,
he's my childhood friend.

37
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:28,624
Never mind. lt's just that
you were my first passenger.

38
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:32,338
Anyway God will look after me.
- Listen... keep this.

39
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:34,070
Pay without work!

40
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:42,509
Anyway keep it. You can boast of
having met a rich man for once.

41
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,780
Go away now.
- Thank you, sir

42
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:48,144
Come on, sir
Check out my lion's speed!

43
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:51,048
Let's go, dear boy!

44
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:57,826
Hadn't you folks moved to the village?
- That's right.

45
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:00,758
So when did you return to the city?
- About seven to eight months ago.

46
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:03,467
How is uncle Veeru ?

47
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:08,001
l don't know
- What do you mean?

48
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:10,569
We've fed quite a few Brahmins
on his death...

49
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,710
but l have still no idea whether
he has found a place in Heaven

50
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:16,138
When did he pass away?

51
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:24,317
He died once, when the master brought
a car to compete with his tonga.

52
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,116
Then l brought Razia to the city.

53
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:32,655
l got busy with the family
business of plying this tonga

54
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:34,563
Razia must have
really grown up now.

55
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:40,270
A poor girl grows as quickly as
a whore gets pregnant.

56
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,901
Has she been married?

57
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:46,778
Well, grooms are not passengers
you find on railway stations.

58
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:49,445
There ought to be a law.

59
00:07:49,782 --> 00:07:52,774
Poor girls ought never be
allowed to reach adolescence!

60
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:59,179
Gauri! Watch out for
that pitcher of youth!

61
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:01,350
Damn you!

62
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:06,923
''Oh you have stolen my heart...''

63
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:09,863
Where did you learn this verse?
- From Sarju bai.

64
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:13,737
Who is Sarju bai?
- A famous singer from Banaras.

65
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,575
She must be around seventy
five years of age.

66
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:22,541
But her voice! lt's as sharp as a
knife that pierces your heart!

67
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:25,475
Are you her neighbor ?
- No. l'm her tenant.

68
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:30,686
From the money she made as a young
woman, she leased some land and...

69
00:08:31,023 --> 00:08:34,789
built houses. l've rented one
of those huts from her.

70
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:37,129
Hey wrestler! Out of my way!

71
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:40,432
lt's four months since
l paid the rent to her.

72
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:44,998
The moment she asks for her rent,
l start singing!

73
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:50,364
She can't bear to hear me do that!
She runs for dear life!

74
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,271
Do you remember the whole song?
- Yes, of course

75
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:53,738
Then why don't you sing it?

76
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,844
Make yourself comfortable, master.
l'll get cracking.

77
00:09:02,788 --> 00:09:16,225
'' Benazir, Benazir...''

78
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,834
Why has it stopped?

79
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:29,380
A melodious rendition, you see.
He loves classical music!

80
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:31,341
No wonder then, he stopped!

81
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:34,415
Sing it in another tune.
- Sure.

82
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,181
Scared of my voice, my boy?

83
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:31,334
Well! There comes the enemy!

84
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:34,398
Hey, driver!

85
00:11:37,943 --> 00:11:40,002
Forgive me, sir.
l had a flat tire

86
00:11:43,382 --> 00:11:46,249
What's the matter, dear? Hasn't
your brother-in-law arrived yet?

87
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:47,247
No uncle Raghu

88
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:50,622
You've brought some bitter
gourd for him, haven't you?

89
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,121
Yes of course! Not only that,
but some cucumber, too.

90
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,260
Just don't worry.
l know all his tastes

91
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:01,628
l've been in this house since
he was three years old.

92
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:05,862
l've also bought raw mangoes
for you. l'll make some chutney.

93
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:09,107
And what about his brother?
- Who? Your husband?

94
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:11,238
He hardly eats!

95
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:14,705
lt's the law books that
fill his stomach!

96
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:28,660
You have come at last!

97
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:31,392
Sister-in-law...
now wait a minute.

98
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:32,993
Haven't l told you
not to touch my feet?

99
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,836
Peace, lady... Peace!

100
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:39,898
God bless you
- What nonsense is that?

101
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:42,868
A sister-in-law is like
a mother, so l touched your feet...

102
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:44,369
and since you're also a friend,
l hugged you...

103
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:47,611
and since you're younger to me,
l kissed your forehead to bless you.

104
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:50,440
You have become smart
haven't you! C'mon now.

105
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:04,494
Why are you peeping in there?
- lsn't Hitler around?

106
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:06,662
God! Does anyone call
his father Hitler?

107
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,193
l don't know about others ...

108
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:11,334
but l've always called Dad
''Hitler'' behind his back!

109
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:13,935
And what's wrong with that?

110
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:16,900
ln this dumb city with its
dumb municipality...

111
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:19,369
l am at least according some
respectability to its chairman

112
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:23,170
Don't shout! He's upstairs
- Good God! He's back so soon!

113
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:26,608
He's busy with the elections nowadays.
He rarely goes to the office.

114
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:29,487
Your elder brother looks
after all the work.

115
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:32,250
C'mon, he's waiting for you.

116
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:35,492
Such luck!
Come home and start reporting!

117
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:45,467
What is it? C'mon!

118
00:13:57,349 --> 00:13:58,509
Father...

119
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:04,686
So you have arrived.
Was the train on time?

120
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:09,157
Are your exams over?
- Yes.

121
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:11,928
How did they go?
- Quite well.

122
00:14:12,898 --> 00:14:14,923
So now what have you decided?

123
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:18,666
You can't be a jester and
play music to earn a living.

124
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:21,868
You will have to take up
a respectable profession.

125
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:25,603
You've arrived, Alok!
Was the train on time?

126
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:26,935
Yes, brother

127
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,210
Ashok?
- Yes father?

128
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:33,574
Make Alok sit with you in
your chamber from tomorrow.

129
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,216
He'll learn something about
the cases, if he sits with you.

130
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:39,215
He can find the books
of law for you.

131
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:41,423
lt is only after he learns about
the High court's judgments..

132
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,194
that he can get an admission
in a law college next year.

133
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:48,825
Father, l was thinking that...
- Stop thinking.

134
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:54,071
And shut the door
on your way out.

135
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:11,050
l am not going to study law.
- Why? What's wrong with law?

136
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:14,290
l've spent my life saying
''yes father, no father'' !

137
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,719
l'll spend the rest of it saying
'' Yes m'lord, No m'lord''

138
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:18,389
Whether you study law or not,...

139
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:20,699
you'll have to come with me
from tomorrow onwards.

140
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,691
You can always escape from there.

141
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:26,836
ln any case, l don't think
law is your cup of tea.

142
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:29,568
Why don't you admit
that you are scared?

143
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:32,604
lf he starts practicing law,
you'll have to quit your practice!

144
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:36,678
lndeed! l'll fight every case
in a musical tone...

145
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:38,209
... and stun everyone.

146
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:41,917
lf the case deals with divorce,
l'll use the Raag Jogia.

147
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:45,382
lf it's anything involving love,
l'll use Raag Vasant Bahar.

148
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:49,693
And if it has to do with murder,
l'll sing Raag Deepak!

149
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:53,130
''Light the lamp of justice''

150
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:01,133
This is injustice!
Gross injustice!

151
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:03,168
And l'll fight every injustice!

152
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:05,840
Even if the moon dares
to leave its lover...

153
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:08,646
l'll sue him in court.

154
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,571
Your honor
l would like to know...

155
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:17,039
who has given the moon the right
to leave its lover?

156
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,714
What nonsense is this?
Go on and sing.

157
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:22,510
This is no nonsense!
This is the plea of a hurt soul!

158
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:24,879
lf the law were
a woman like you...

159
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:27,749
it would certainly understand
the feelings of my client.

160
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,057
No girl can be happy talking
to just one friend all her life.

161
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:33,255
l am sure, my honor...

162
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,363
Once you have listened to
my client's version...

163
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:39,260
the court will certainly
grant restraint against the Moon!

164
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,505
Look at the moon's injustice,
Your Honor!

165
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:25,750
He's leaving his beloved,
without a word...

166
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:30,212
and he even refuses to say
when he will return!

167
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:33,657
Oh, the gentlemen of
the jury have arrived

168
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:36,658
Spare a thought,
member of the jury,...

169
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:38,121
and don't think like men!

170
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:40,465
Leave the thinking part
to your sister-in-law.

171
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:46,302
The jury ought to know that
there are no relations in a suit!

172
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:49,130
But since the court is feminine,
hence without a jury too...

173
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:52,205
it can understand the
feelings of the lady love

174
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:55,475
This is not funny, m'lord,
not funny at all!

175
00:19:56,074 --> 00:19:59,373
Aren't you coming to the office?

176
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:00,574
Brother...

177
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:05,539
Dad's upset with my wife anyway,
because she insisted on...

178
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:08,114
sending you to learn music.
lf you don't attend office now...

179
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:11,445
he'll send her packing
to her parents' house.

180
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,588
That will be great.
l'll go with her, too!

181
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,994
Stop joking, Alok.
And get ready at once.

182
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:19,460
Okay, l'm ready. Let's go.

183
00:20:19,832 --> 00:20:22,426
But l have some work on the way.
l'll be away for some time

184
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:27,130
l'm not fond of becoming
an MLA or MP.

185
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:30,667
What will l achieve
by becoming an MLA anyway?

186
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:35,446
But just as some people have
hunting and kite-flying as hobbies...

187
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:37,874
l'm fond of contesting elections
and so l will.

188
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,308
Father...
- What's the matter?

189
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:41,882
lt's Alok's first day at the
office. He wants your blessings.

190
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:45,212
What was l saying?

191
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:48,724
Carry on. You'll get late.

192
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:58,997
l was asking you to chalk out
regions on the basis of caste...

193
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:02,398
so we can have candidates
fitting the requirements.

194
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:08,647
Or we'll have a lower caste chap
canvassing in a Brahmin locality

195
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:13,674
Put your heart
in your work!

196
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:27,490
Stop here.

197
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:35,999
My office is here.

198
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:39,808
But be at my office by 5 p.m.
We must go home together.

199
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:51,412
Where does Ganesh live?

200
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:41,199
Mother! lt's the scoundrel again!

201
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:47,374
Greetings.

202
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:50,373
You seem to come
from a good family.

203
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:54,350
But despite all the insults,
you will still keep coming here!

204
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:57,246
What do you mean?
- What is the matter, madam?

205
00:22:57,622 --> 00:22:59,283
He is one of those scoundrels.

206
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:03,559
Look at his long hair,
looks more like a girl!

207
00:23:04,162 --> 00:23:08,064
Get me the scissors, dear!
l'll give him a haircut!

208
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:10,867
You're mistaken. l'm not
what you think l am.

209
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:16,138
My name is Alok and l...
- Who cares what your name is?

210
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,566
But tell me, how dare you
come in without permission?

211
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:21,138
Doesn't Ms.Sarju from Banaras
stay here?

212
00:23:21,513 --> 00:23:23,413
Are you her childhood friend...

213
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:25,808
that you ask for her
so arrogantly?

214
00:23:26,184 --> 00:23:31,520
Can't you answer me politely?
- That's my way of speaking.

215
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:34,450
What work do you have with her?

216
00:23:35,193 --> 00:23:37,718
l heard that she sings
very well, so l...

217
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,064
So you came barging in here
to listen!

218
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:44,367
Do you think she is a courtesan?
- You are impossible!

219
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:47,137
That l maybe.
But you must leave immediately!

220
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:48,269
Okay, l am going.

221
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,277
What has the world come to!

222
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:56,740
He looks like a gentleman from
his dress and looks.

223
00:23:57,115 --> 00:24:00,107
Have you been swallowing only anger
or have you taken your medicines too?

224
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:03,012
Damn the medicines!
lt's not going to help me anyway.

225
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:07,217
Go home, dear, and rehearse.
l want to rest.

226
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:16,424
Young master!
where are you going?

227
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:20,863
Running for my life from Ms.Sarju.
She is nothing but trouble

228
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:24,402
No, no she is a sweet person, ...

229
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:26,939
tough from outside and
tender within.

230
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:29,846
She might be sweet to you.

231
00:24:30,215 --> 00:24:33,742
All l know that she is harsh in
her speech, no sweetness at all

232
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:37,919
No, master. Don't worry.
Come with me. Come to my house.

233
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:39,484
No, not today.

234
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:42,953
You cannot refuse.
l'll treat you to some hot tea.

235
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:44,819
Razia! Razia!

236
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:56,534
Come in and sit down.

237
00:24:57,242 --> 00:24:59,972
Well, Ganesh... You do put in
a lot of effort for your music.

238
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:02,075
You have a tabla and harmonium...
- These are not mine, master.

239
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,315
lt's just that one day Madam Sarju
heard Razia humming a tune and...

240
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,084
since then she has vowed
to teach her to sing.

241
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,288
l told her that we cannot
afford two square meals a day.

242
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:14,683
How can l afford to teach her?

243
00:25:15,026 --> 00:25:18,086
But she wouldn't listen....

244
00:25:18,396 --> 00:25:23,197
and next thing l knew was that she
has bought these instruments for her.

245
00:25:23,468 --> 00:25:25,333
Brother...

246
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:26,433
l'll just come, master.

247
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,308
lt's the young master!
Make cup of tea.

248
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,510
No use whispering now.

249
00:25:34,045 --> 00:25:37,674
She has heard you yelling.
She must be coming over.

250
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:38,880
Oh God!

251
00:25:39,184 --> 00:25:40,776
Young master!

252
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:42,777
lt's time for my practice.
- What happened?

253
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:45,089
The landlady is coming here
to collect her rent.

254
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,985
Let's just move a bit and
start singing loudly.

255
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:47,062
Here she is...
to collect the rent

256
00:28:47,772 --> 00:28:52,300
Keep singing! But today l won't go
away without collecting my rent.

257
00:28:53,144 --> 00:28:54,805
So what's the point in singing?

258
00:28:56,247 --> 00:29:00,013
Either give me the rent
or vacate my house!

259
00:29:00,418 --> 00:29:04,149
Let's now put an end
to this daily nagging.

260
00:29:04,522 --> 00:29:06,786
l've been staying in God's world
for the past 26 years and...

261
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,387
He never came asking for rent.

262
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:13,027
And you have come 56000 times
in the last six months.

263
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:16,664
Razia, let's pack our bags.
We are moving out

264
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:18,966
Where are you taking Razia?

265
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:24,070
How does it matter to you?
She goes with me. lsn't that right?

266
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:31,676
But first tell me...
what is this scoundrel doing here?

267
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:35,417
What's wrong with you?
He is our young master.

268
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:39,245
My forefathers used
to work at his place.

269
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:42,557
Ganesh had spoken about you. So
l came to learn music from you.

270
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:44,619
To learn music indeed!

271
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,026
Do you understand music?

272
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:51,767
He has graduated in music...
- Keep quiet.

273
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:56,702
l have learnt music, madam.
But l can't say l understand it

274
00:29:57,208 --> 00:30:01,372
You have a way with words.
Who is your Guru?

275
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,007
Pundit Jamnaprasad

276
00:30:06,818 --> 00:30:08,445
He is a very accomplished musician.

277
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,687
Then you must definitely be good.

278
00:30:12,257 --> 00:30:14,487
He never teaches those
without talent.

279
00:30:14,893 --> 00:30:16,884
How is Panditji?
Does he still sing?

280
00:30:17,362 --> 00:30:20,126
No, he doesn't.
He's become too old.

281
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:23,893
Raja Bahadur was right.

282
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:29,163
When art gains youth,
the artists become old.

283
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:31,941
Raja Bahadur? Who's that?

284
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,902
You must've never
heard of him, Sir

285
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:41,877
After his wife's death he was lost
in loneliness, never to return

286
00:30:42,353 --> 00:30:44,617
Madam will tell you some day.

287
00:30:44,923 --> 00:30:46,322
There you go again!

288
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:51,089
l brought it up
deliberately, madam

289
00:30:51,463 --> 00:30:54,398
ls he old enough to understand the
depths of Raja Bahadur's anguish?

290
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,428
God knows when you'll learn!

291
00:30:56,734 --> 00:31:00,261
Madam, till he does not
experience pain himself...

292
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:03,802
he will have to take recourse
in Raja Bahadur's pain.

293
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:06,372
To understand life and
music better...

294
00:31:06,744 --> 00:31:09,975
explain the relationship between
art and artist to him, madam.

295
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:14,274
Yes! Till you teach my master,
l'll hurry back.

296
00:31:16,754 --> 00:31:19,188
What are you waiting for?
Make some nice hot tea

297
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:23,788
What lovely timing! We escaped
paying the rent again!

298
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:26,595
Go ahead and make some tea

299
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:30,667
Madam...

300
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:36,830
l wondered, Maharaj.
Where do l begin?

301
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:38,374
From that very night.

302
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:41,877
Which night is he
talking about?

303
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:49,485
The night, in whose darkness l saw
him clearly for the first time

304
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:52,353
lt was a stormy night.

305
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:57,453
lt looked like it would
never stop raining

306
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:00,520
l was performing that night.

307
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:04,198
When we got the news
of the queen's demise...

308
00:32:04,602 --> 00:32:07,833
l stopped dancing and
rushed to the palace.

309
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:14,309
On reaching there, l saw
everyone deep in mourning

310
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:18,280
There was a big crowd.

311
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:22,416
l heard that Raja Bahadur had
locked himself in a room.

312
00:32:22,887 --> 00:32:29,952
l was scared....
And l starting knocking on the door.

313
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:34,021
My Lord!

314
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:37,766
Who's it?
- lt's me, sir, Sarju

315
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:47,769
Come in, Sarju

316
00:33:33,057 --> 00:33:37,858
ln such a stormy night...

317
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:44,065
in these incessant rains,
no one leaves their house...

318
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:48,769
but the Queen has left forever.

319
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:53,904
Don't cry, Sarju.

320
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:58,006
Get the tanpura.

321
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:00,678
l was scared.

322
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,886
l looked at him in fear.
He understood.

323
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:08,819
He asked me not to be scared.

324
00:34:09,193 --> 00:34:15,325
''Neither have l lost my senses
nor will l ask you to sing'', he said.

325
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:19,159
''Tonight, l will sing''

326
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:23,834
Which song did he sing?
Will you sing it?

327
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:26,110
How can l sing that song, son?

328
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:33,082
How can l convey the pain
in his heart, in my song?

329
00:34:33,384 --> 00:34:34,976
Sing it, Madam

330
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,510
No, Gupta.
l don't have the time.

331
00:38:25,883 --> 00:38:28,147
l'm very busy with the
nitty-gritty of elections.

332
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:30,147
Besides, it's a weak case.

333
00:38:30,554 --> 00:38:32,215
lf you have already
leased the land,...

334
00:38:32,523 --> 00:38:35,048
why crib about it?
Why did you lease it anyway?

335
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,917
You had recommended
the old lady to me.

336
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:38,256
Me?

337
00:38:38,562 --> 00:38:39,893
There is one Raja Bahadur,
you know.

338
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:41,664
She had come to you
with a reference from him.

339
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:43,590
So she's the one!

340
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,698
But why did you give away
the land next to mill?

341
00:38:47,004 --> 00:38:49,996
How was l to know that the
mill would be so successful?

342
00:38:50,474 --> 00:38:52,601
Try and get me back that land.

343
00:38:52,977 --> 00:38:55,969
You can fight the case if you want.
But it will be of no use.

344
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,647
lf you try, we can always
find a way out.

345
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:03,613
Am l a magician to breathe life
into a dead case?

346
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:06,617
Sir...
- l'll be back soon.

347
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:09,792
Please get him a chair
- That's okay, just come soon.

348
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:16,628
Madam Sarju is really amazing.
- lt's good that she agreed.

349
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:20,765
Now you learn to sing and
l'll teach you to smoke, too.

350
00:39:25,176 --> 00:39:26,234
C'mon, let's go.

351
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,873
Gupta, send me that file
of the land case.

352
00:39:34,218 --> 00:39:37,153
l'll find a way out

353
00:39:57,475 --> 00:39:59,500
Here, have a smoke..

354
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:02,307
Why this formality with me?

355
00:40:02,713 --> 00:40:05,477
lnstead of smoking openly in the
market with a tonga driver,...

356
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:07,216
it's better you smoke with me.

357
00:40:07,752 --> 00:40:10,983
You stupid, dumb, idiot!
What do you think of yourself?

358
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:14,186
You don't dare for yourself
nor for the family's respect!

359
00:40:14,558 --> 00:40:16,822
l am contesting the elections
and my son...

360
00:40:17,128 --> 00:40:18,959
smokes bidis in bad company!

361
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:21,330
What are you staring at me for?
Get lost!

362
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:24,298
Ashok, come here.

363
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:25,865
What happened?

364
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:35,574
You took him to the office, right?
- Yes.

365
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,575
But he had some work
at the market.

366
00:40:37,982 --> 00:40:40,109
Do you know where he had gone?
- No.

367
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:44,684
l know. But never mind.
l'll fix that.

368
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,852
What's wrong, father?

369
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:50,490
You and Ashok have vowed
to spoil him!

370
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:52,988
Give him some responsibilities.

371
00:40:53,664 --> 00:40:57,691
Gupta has been nagging me
on a match for his daughter.

372
00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:00,162
Send Alok there tomorrow.
Let him take a look at the girl

373
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:03,564
Now listen, sis-in-law...
l'm sorry!

374
00:41:03,908 --> 00:41:06,376
l won't smoke ever again,
nor will l sing...

375
00:41:06,677 --> 00:41:07,644
but save me from
Mr. Gupta's daughter

376
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:09,903
No, l won't interfere
in your matters anymore.

377
00:41:10,247 --> 00:41:12,340
But sister-in-law...
- When will you grow up?

378
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,174
l'll grow up whenever
you want me to...

379
00:41:14,518 --> 00:41:16,315
but just save me from
Mr. Gupta's daughter.

380
00:41:16,654 --> 00:41:17,746
You'll have to go
there tomorrow.

381
00:41:20,224 --> 00:41:23,819
By the grace of God, my
business is so successful...

382
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:27,528
that what seemed like a big dream
yesterday, is now a reality.

383
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:29,526
So l want to expand
the business.

384
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:33,936
Only the other day, your father
suggested a very good idea.

385
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:39,038
He wants me to take the
permit during his tenure.

386
00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:43,040
So l can start a bus service
all over the country.

387
00:41:43,481 --> 00:41:47,645
How many things can
l handle on my own?

388
00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:50,545
Are you listening, dear.
please come here!

389
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:54,724
Give him a break, dear.
Give the poor chap a chance to speak.

390
00:41:55,092 --> 00:41:56,059
Greetings, son

391
00:41:56,527 --> 00:41:58,620
His father is the one contesting
the elections and ...

392
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:01,226
here you are,
delivering the speech!

393
00:42:01,632 --> 00:42:05,625
Dear! Get the tea!
- Please don't be so formal.

394
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,762
Even if we agree to
have no formalities...

395
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:09,663
Sulakshana will not agree.

396
00:42:11,775 --> 00:42:13,640
Come, dear.

397
00:42:17,381 --> 00:42:22,409
Chandrika Prasad must be waiting
for you at the office.

398
00:42:22,753 --> 00:42:24,618
Chandrika Prasad?
Who's Chandrika Prasad?

399
00:42:25,055 --> 00:42:28,081
At least go to the office!
You will remember him!

400
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:33,154
Chandrika Prasad! l see!
- That's right.

401
00:42:33,464 --> 00:42:34,954
Sit down and have the tea, son.

402
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:38,858
l hope he doesn't tell Chandrika
who you are.

403
00:42:39,203 --> 00:42:40,761
l'll go and take a look.

404
00:42:47,611 --> 00:42:51,672
You must have understood that
no such man really exists.

405
00:42:52,116 --> 00:42:54,107
They wanted to leave us
alone to talk.

406
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:57,284
But you mustn't take advantage
of this opportunity.

407
00:42:57,621 --> 00:42:59,612
Because l won't be
marrying you in any case.

408
00:43:02,693 --> 00:43:05,787
Well? l wasn't being funny.

409
00:43:06,297 --> 00:43:08,424
No, l'm not laughing at you.

410
00:43:08,832 --> 00:43:11,300
l was going to say
the same thing to you.

411
00:43:11,635 --> 00:43:15,127
What?
- That l don't want to marry you.

412
00:43:15,472 --> 00:43:17,531
Why not? Why don't you want to
get married to me?

413
00:43:17,808 --> 00:43:19,799
Am l handicapped?
ls my father a pauper?

414
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:23,205
lt's okay if l've flunked at school
a couple of times, but...

415
00:43:23,581 --> 00:43:25,412
But l have never ever failed

416
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:31,478
Actually l am in love with someone
else... and want to marry him.

417
00:43:32,156 --> 00:43:35,557
And l don't even want to think
of marriage right now

418
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,260
So then, let's be friends.

419
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:45,125
They're shaking hands.
- What are they discussing?

420
00:43:45,603 --> 00:43:46,865
Aren't you ashamed?

421
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:50,502
You want to listen to what your
daughter and her fiancee talk?

422
00:43:52,376 --> 00:43:55,539
Listen... may l take advantage
some of our meeting?

423
00:43:55,846 --> 00:43:56,938
Advantage? How's that?

424
00:43:57,314 --> 00:44:01,512
l'm supposed to meet Kishen now.
- Who is Kishen?

425
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:04,613
l just told you about him!
- Oh yes!

426
00:44:04,955 --> 00:44:08,083
His name is Kishen. Your arrival
has upset all my plans.

427
00:44:08,525 --> 00:44:11,983
Why don't you take me out on
the pretext of sightseeing?

428
00:44:12,396 --> 00:44:16,264
That would be easy,
but how do l ask permission?

429
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:18,761
Don't worry about that.
l'll take care of it.

430
00:44:19,169 --> 00:44:22,969
lf l address mother as mummy,
she always agrees.

431
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:26,506
What's the matter dear?

432
00:44:27,011 --> 00:44:31,038
He wants to take me out.
May l go?

433
00:44:31,448 --> 00:44:36,511
What's there to feel shy about?
Go on, take this bag, too

434
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,865
Here... stop it.

435
00:45:02,112 --> 00:45:05,240
You write poetry, don't you?
- Why?

436
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:08,413
l'll at least take half hour here.
What will you do till then?

437
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:10,184
Don't worry about me.

438
00:45:10,688 --> 00:45:13,384
Go and meet Kishen.
l'll go to the riverside.

439
00:45:14,024 --> 00:45:16,185
Riverside?
- l'll explain later.

440
00:45:16,527 --> 00:45:18,392
Let me go now.
- At least meet my Kishen.

441
00:45:19,163 --> 00:45:20,687
When l come to pick you up,
l'll meet him then.

442
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:23,963
Listen...

443
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:28,928
lt was nice meeting you.

444
00:45:29,406 --> 00:45:31,840
Don't make me wait
for too long, okay?

445
00:45:35,012 --> 00:45:36,912
Here's your fare.

446
00:45:45,923 --> 00:45:52,123
What's the matter?
Tell me.

447
00:45:52,429 --> 00:45:53,225
l have a headache.

448
00:45:53,664 --> 00:45:59,967
How can you have an ache in your
head? lt's preoccupied by me!

449
00:46:00,337 --> 00:46:03,101
Now stop pretending. l just
saw you standing in the balcony.

450
00:46:04,441 --> 00:46:06,841
Who was that?
- Who?

451
00:46:08,812 --> 00:46:11,303
That chap...
the darling!

452
00:46:11,782 --> 00:46:15,946
l see! lsn't he very
good looking?

453
00:46:16,453 --> 00:46:20,822
You're not jealous, are you?
- Why should l be jealous?

454
00:46:21,158 --> 00:46:23,319
One can never tell!

455
00:46:23,894 --> 00:46:25,225
Do you know who he is?

456
00:46:25,629 --> 00:46:30,828
He's, Alok. The only son of the
chairman of the municipality.

457
00:46:31,268 --> 00:46:35,136
My father wants me to marry him.
- So why tell me about it?

458
00:46:35,572 --> 00:46:40,134
Go ahead and marry him and l'll
parcel all your promises to you.

459
00:46:40,677 --> 00:46:44,238
Really?
All the promises, l hope?

460
00:46:44,581 --> 00:46:47,072
Don't forget any of them, okay?
- Stop joking.

461
00:46:47,484 --> 00:46:50,351
You jealous, stupid fool!

462
00:46:50,754 --> 00:46:54,417
That decent man came to drop me here
when he heard of our love.

463
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:56,352
And you...

464
00:46:56,794 --> 00:47:01,163
Listen, Sulakshana!
Don't be angry, please.

465
00:47:01,532 --> 00:47:05,662
And tell me, had you seen
the same scene, finding me...

466
00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:08,938
standing on the road with a
girl, yelling ''Oh darling,...

467
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,433
don't make me wait too long, come
back soon'', what would you think?

468
00:47:14,144 --> 00:47:17,580
How would you react?
- l wouldn't think at all.

469
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,482
l'd do something
- Do what?

470
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,910
l'd kill both of you!

471
00:51:20,157 --> 00:51:22,921
Ganesh, Oh Ganesh!

472
00:51:28,732 --> 00:51:29,960
lsn't he there?

473
00:51:32,969 --> 00:51:34,800
Should l stand here or
may l come in?

474
00:51:36,006 --> 00:51:37,974
Do come in.

475
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:41,936
Where has he gone?
- He has gone somewhere with mother.

476
00:51:42,946 --> 00:51:43,970
What is this you are doing?

477
00:51:44,347 --> 00:51:48,579
Wow! Your hands can work wonders!

478
00:51:50,587 --> 00:51:53,317
Who are you making this for?
- For mother.

479
00:51:54,057 --> 00:51:57,458
Today is her birthday
- Mother's birthday?

480
00:51:58,261 --> 00:52:03,858
Razia, when you look at mother,
you don't feel that...

481
00:52:04,201 --> 00:52:05,725
she was ever a child

482
00:52:06,236 --> 00:52:09,137
lf she wasn't a child.
Then how could she have grown up?

483
00:52:09,706 --> 00:52:15,611
Well anyway,
l was there but...

484
00:52:15,879 --> 00:52:17,847
Maharaj did not mention anything
about her birthday.

485
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:21,910
When does Maharaj ever speak?
- Like you, isn't it?

486
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:27,684
Tell me something, Razia.

487
00:52:28,091 --> 00:52:32,755
Maharaj is good at playing the tabla.
Today l heard him singing too.

488
00:52:33,096 --> 00:52:34,791
Then why does he work as a
servant at Madam's house?

489
00:52:35,132 --> 00:52:37,498
No, he is not a servant
- So what is he?

490
00:52:38,135 --> 00:52:43,163
Madam is all alone.
So he looks after her.

491
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:49,340
He's from a rich family.
Madam often tells him to go back...

492
00:52:49,613 --> 00:52:55,415
to his home, but he refuses and now
people say that he won't ever go.

493
00:52:55,752 --> 00:52:58,619
Why not?
- How would l know?

494
00:52:58,989 --> 00:53:02,652
This looks like something romantic.

495
00:53:03,026 --> 00:53:05,460
What?
- Romance, love.

496
00:53:05,862 --> 00:53:08,956
No.
- Well, if it's not love, then...

497
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:12,827
why should he leave his home and
lead a life in her shadows.

498
00:53:13,837 --> 00:53:16,772
How would l know?
- People say that...

499
00:53:17,174 --> 00:53:21,474
Maharaj saw Madam at one of her
performances and since then...

500
00:53:21,845 --> 00:53:26,873
has always been by her side

501
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,684
You're a crazy girl!
That's what love is all about!

502
00:53:29,953 --> 00:53:30,920
Okay, Razia listen.

503
00:53:31,288 --> 00:53:33,586
We will celebrate Madam's
birthday in a big way.

504
00:53:33,924 --> 00:53:37,826
But don't mention this to Ganesh,
Maharaj or anyone else.

505
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:40,263
Okay. l'll go now.

506
00:53:40,597 --> 00:53:44,897
Listen, may l embroider
a flower on this?

507
00:53:45,335 --> 00:53:47,633
Sure, go ahead.

508
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:57,937
Sister-in-law! ...Let me have
two hundred rupees. At once.

509
00:53:58,215 --> 00:53:58,909
Damn the money.

510
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:00,841
You left in the morning and
you are returning home now.

511
00:54:01,218 --> 00:54:03,618
Your father and brother have
left for the office long back.

512
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,887
Dad has left, too?

513
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:08,282
Thank God l've escaped!
Else, l'd have been stuck!

514
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:11,924
He was asking for you and
l had to lie to him...

515
00:54:12,229 --> 00:54:13,253
that you had gone to the doctor

516
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:17,563
That's great. That's just why
l like you, you know.

517
00:54:17,868 --> 00:54:18,493
What else was he saying?

518
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:20,997
He said that today he would cure
your illness once and for all.

519
00:54:21,304 --> 00:54:22,271
Where were you?

520
00:54:22,706 --> 00:54:24,401
l had gone to buy a sari.
- Sari?

521
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:27,199
Yes, that's why
l wanted the money.

522
00:54:27,544 --> 00:54:29,739
l liked the sari,
but l didn't have the money.

523
00:54:30,046 --> 00:54:33,174
l'm a rich man's son. So the
shopkeeper gave it to me on credit.

524
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:37,178
What's wrong with you?
Will Sulakshana wear a white sari?

525
00:54:37,554 --> 00:54:39,818
Why, can't anyone else besides
Sulakshana wear a sari?

526
00:54:40,156 --> 00:54:41,350
There are others too

527
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:44,191
You mean...
- That's right

528
00:54:44,527 --> 00:54:45,960
Who is it?
- Someone.

529
00:54:46,496 --> 00:54:49,260
l can see that. But who is she?
Where does she stay?

530
00:54:49,532 --> 00:54:50,556
Right here in this city.

531
00:54:50,867 --> 00:54:53,665
C'mon, Alok. Stop fooling.
Tell me the truth. Who is it?

532
00:54:54,037 --> 00:54:57,097
l'll tell you;
have some patience

533
00:54:58,308 --> 00:54:59,741
She is truly amazing!

534
00:55:00,243 --> 00:55:03,440
Except for you, l haven't seen
anyone like her ever!

535
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:08,313
Sometimes in anger, sometimes in
love, the way she shouts at me.

536
00:55:08,652 --> 00:55:11,485
And God save me when
she starts singing!

537
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:14,153
One is lost in the
range of her voice.

538
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:18,686
Her color... she's slightly
darker of skin than you.

539
00:55:19,462 --> 00:55:25,992
Her height... she's
slightly taller than you.

540
00:55:26,436 --> 00:55:29,803
And her age...
she about yours. 70 or 75.

541
00:55:31,007 --> 00:55:32,907
You were truly wonderful!

542
00:55:33,343 --> 00:55:37,712
That's no big deal. But before he
appeals, confiscate the land

543
00:55:37,781 --> 00:55:41,615
Don't worry.
l've made all arrangements.

544
00:56:33,937 --> 00:56:34,733
What happened?

545
00:56:36,272 --> 00:56:39,036
Why doesn't someone
tell me something?

546
00:56:39,776 --> 00:56:43,803
l beg you, please
leave us and go away!

547
00:56:44,147 --> 00:56:44,670
Why?

548
00:56:45,048 --> 00:56:46,572
Assume that madam has
become homeless today.

549
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:47,712
How can you say that?

550
00:56:48,084 --> 00:56:51,019
Aren't we there to
take care of her?

551
00:56:51,488 --> 00:56:53,456
Mother will stay at my place.

552
00:56:53,823 --> 00:56:56,314
Will you stop talking and
explain to me for a change?

553
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,928
Madam lost the case.

554
00:56:59,496 --> 00:57:08,700
l thought that l had purchased
this land with my life's savings.

555
00:57:09,105 --> 00:57:15,977
l thought it was mine now.
l don't know where to go now.

556
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:20,809
Ganesh, couldn't you tell me
about this case earlier?

557
00:57:21,217 --> 00:57:23,845
Don't you know that my dad is one
of the brilliant lawyers around?

558
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,653
Tell this innocent chap
to go home, Maharaj.

559
00:57:27,991 --> 00:57:29,390
Send him home, Maharaj.

560
00:57:29,893 --> 00:57:31,793
Step aside, master...

561
00:57:32,395 --> 00:57:33,453
What is it?

562
00:57:34,531 --> 00:57:40,197
lt's your father who's fighting
this case against her, master.

563
00:57:42,906 --> 00:57:44,601
Come on in.

564
00:57:45,508 --> 00:57:46,998
Take it to the lady upstairs.

565
00:57:49,345 --> 00:57:53,509
What's all this?
- Just some sweets and gifts!

566
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:58,786
l tell you, you're no lawyer!
You are a magician!

567
00:57:59,122 --> 00:58:00,089
Sit down, Gupta.

568
00:58:01,658 --> 00:58:04,126
Keep this 20,000 rupees

569
00:58:04,494 --> 00:58:08,396
20,000? What for? We're going
to be family soon.

570
00:58:08,765 --> 00:58:11,359
No, sir. We will not mix
profession and relations.

571
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:13,259
And the case you have won today...

572
00:58:13,636 --> 00:58:16,628
is one the old lady just couldn't
lose, even if she wanted to!

573
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:18,538
You must accept the money.

574
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:22,102
Okay, but not the whole amount.

575
00:58:22,479 --> 00:58:24,538
Only half of it.
- Why half?

576
00:58:24,948 --> 00:58:28,281
Because l too had some
interest in this case.

577
00:58:28,718 --> 00:58:31,209
l don't understand
- l'll explain it to you.

578
00:58:31,654 --> 00:58:36,091
My son, the great musician
Alok Prasad,...

579
00:58:36,392 --> 00:58:39,156
was learning music
from the same woman.

580
00:58:39,596 --> 00:58:43,692
And then he started keeping
bad company. So...

581
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:47,992
l decided that l'd
put an end to all that.

582
00:58:48,304 --> 00:58:50,636
lf she did not have a house,
then how could he go there?

583
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,135
Why are you upset with him?
He's just a kid.

584
00:58:53,476 --> 00:58:56,843
Once he is faced with
responsibilities, he will...

585
00:58:57,147 --> 00:58:58,978
Alok! You have a long life!
We were talking about you!

586
00:58:59,382 --> 00:59:04,843
Take this 10,000 rupees and
buy yourself a second-hand car.

587
00:59:05,488 --> 00:59:08,355
Laljee at the garage has a car.

588
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:12,090
Ashok has his own car and
get one for yourself too.

589
00:59:13,563 --> 00:59:14,928
God bless you.

590
00:59:19,936 --> 00:59:24,498
Such a well behaved son!

591
00:59:24,941 --> 00:59:27,603
Or you couldn't catch children
touching parents' feet nowadays!

592
00:59:27,944 --> 00:59:30,242
But why are you asking him
to buy a second-hand car?

593
00:59:30,713 --> 00:59:32,647
l'll be giving him
a new car in dowry.

594
00:59:33,082 --> 00:59:36,483
Let him learn on
the old car first.

595
00:59:40,156 --> 00:59:42,056
Can l drop you somewhere,
young master?

596
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:54,235
How much does this tonga cost?
- Rs 3,000

597
00:59:58,474 --> 00:59:59,907
Will you sell it?

598
01:00:00,543 --> 01:00:03,239
Hello, uncle...
- God bless you, my dear.

599
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:07,442
What have you done to Sulakshana?
She's always praising you.

600
01:00:07,884 --> 01:00:10,352
So why don't you send her here
as soon as possible?

601
01:00:10,653 --> 01:00:11,779
Than l can hear it for myself.

602
01:00:12,155 --> 01:00:15,022
Then why don't you fix up a
wedding date as soon as possible?

603
01:00:15,325 --> 01:00:18,089
Oh yes, l'll do that right away

604
01:00:29,105 --> 01:00:31,733
How do you like this tonga, dad?
l've bought it.

605
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:33,535
Bought it?

606
01:00:34,043 --> 01:00:37,274
l thought it would be
better than a car for me.

607
01:00:37,847 --> 01:00:42,716
Actually the joy in sitting in a
tonga is hardly there in a car

608
01:00:42,986 --> 01:00:48,288
But than the horse's fodder is
rather expensive and...

609
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:49,751
you'll also need
to keep a driver.

610
01:00:50,026 --> 01:00:51,857
Why a driver?
l'll drive it myself

611
01:00:52,295 --> 01:00:53,284
You !

612
01:00:53,596 --> 01:00:57,157
Yes, you wanted me to take up a
better profession than music.

613
01:00:57,634 --> 01:01:01,900
l'll start plying the tonga.
- What are you saying?

614
01:01:02,272 --> 01:01:03,762
You shut up, daughter-in-law!

615
01:01:04,207 --> 01:01:05,970
Sir... l... l'll take your leave.

616
01:01:06,242 --> 01:01:09,871
How can you leave? Your future
son-in-law has not finished yet.

617
01:01:15,585 --> 01:01:19,919
The city respects your father!

618
01:01:20,323 --> 01:01:22,883
Will you ply a tonga in
this very city?

619
01:01:23,192 --> 01:01:23,988
Yes, father.

620
01:01:24,294 --> 01:01:25,318
Are you out of your senses?

621
01:01:25,662 --> 01:01:28,631
l told you not to interfere.

622
01:01:28,998 --> 01:01:31,967
Dad is right.
You go inside.

623
01:01:32,835 --> 01:01:37,033
Talking to a tonga driver is not
good for the lady of this house.

624
01:01:37,674 --> 01:01:40,609
Driving a tonga is a very
hard-working honest man's job

625
01:01:40,977 --> 01:01:42,274
There is no respect in it.

626
01:01:42,645 --> 01:01:45,113
A respectable job is of a lawyer
who finds loopholes in the law...

627
01:01:45,448 --> 01:01:48,178
to drive an old and
helpless lady homeless.

628
01:01:48,751 --> 01:01:53,415
Dad, l had come to convey
to you that...

629
01:01:53,856 --> 01:01:58,987
having rendered Sarju homeless,
you have fallen in my esteem.

630
01:01:59,729 --> 01:02:01,856
The ten thousand rupees is a loan
that l'll pay you back soon.

631
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:03,496
What a childish way
to behave, my son!

632
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:05,698
The father does everything in
the interests of his children!

633
01:02:06,035 --> 01:02:09,129
Gupta!
Please don't interfere in this.

634
01:02:09,472 --> 01:02:18,346
Listen, l have a car.
l don't need your tonga

635
01:02:18,748 --> 01:02:22,912
You may go now.
Go away.

636
01:02:25,521 --> 01:02:28,615
Father...!
- Listen, daughter-in-law!

637
01:02:28,991 --> 01:02:32,552
l'm not his father alone. l must
also protect my family honor!

638
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:14,668
Razia, Razia...

639
01:03:22,078 --> 01:03:24,808
Have you spoken to him?
- Not yet.

640
01:03:25,181 --> 01:03:27,911
Then do it now. lf possible,
let's try and leave today itself

641
01:03:28,251 --> 01:03:29,650
Okay.

642
01:03:31,821 --> 01:03:33,584
Okay madam, l'm
leaving for work

643
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:35,755
Listen son...
- Yes?

644
01:03:36,192 --> 01:03:43,223
l wanted to say something to you.
- What is it, mother?

645
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:47,998
Shall l go to Banaras for a few days?
- What for?

646
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:53,000
Maharaj has been
asking me to and...

647
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:55,276
Razia could also
have a vacation

648
01:03:56,712 --> 01:03:58,304
When would you
like to leave?

649
01:03:58,648 --> 01:04:00,377
By this evening's train.

650
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:04,145
Okay, l'll try and
come to the station

651
01:04:10,927 --> 01:04:14,124
lt's a good thing the
young master has consented.

652
01:04:14,464 --> 01:04:16,591
Very soon, we too will
join us there.

653
01:04:16,999 --> 01:04:19,058
Nowadays it's the age of cars in the city

654
01:04:19,469 --> 01:04:21,334
No one wants to take
a tonga ride.

655
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:25,633
At this rate, soon
l'll be out of a job.

656
01:04:31,547 --> 01:04:34,311
Did you bring your
brother along?

657
01:04:34,784 --> 01:04:36,308
l couldn't find him.

658
01:04:37,687 --> 01:04:39,314
Now there is no point anyway.

659
01:04:39,755 --> 01:04:45,091
l admit, l refused him permission
to take up music as a profession.

660
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:49,090
But he could always take up a job
as a teacher or a clerk...

661
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:55,404
but no! He will live right in
this city and ply a tonga...

662
01:04:55,705 --> 01:05:01,234
only because he can insult me
and make me feel embarrassed.

663
01:05:01,677 --> 01:05:02,871
Very well.

664
01:05:03,513 --> 01:05:08,212
lf he can be stubborn, then
l know how to handle him too.

665
01:05:11,187 --> 01:05:13,747
Your lunch, young master.

666
01:05:14,891 --> 01:05:18,349
Oh, l forgot. This is
yesterday's earnings.

667
01:05:18,728 --> 01:05:20,093
What happened?

668
01:05:20,796 --> 01:05:25,028
Why don't you keep it with you?
Then you can buy a meal for yourself.

669
01:05:25,368 --> 01:05:27,029
This food is not good
for you anyway.

670
01:05:28,538 --> 01:05:31,098
What is good enough for you
is good enough for me too.

671
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:35,740
Don't ever say something like that.
Take this.

672
01:05:36,078 --> 01:05:37,875
May l say something, master?
- Go ahead.

673
01:05:38,281 --> 01:05:42,012
This job is not meant for you...

674
01:05:42,418 --> 01:05:45,148
why don't you go home and
apologize to your father?

675
01:05:51,794 --> 01:05:55,787
lt seems that you don't want me
to stay here anymore.

676
01:05:56,132 --> 01:05:57,963
lf you ever speak like this again,
l'll leave this place...

677
01:05:58,234 --> 01:05:59,599
Go away now.
