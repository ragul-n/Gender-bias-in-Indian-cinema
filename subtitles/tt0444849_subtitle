1
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:05,182
''Like a wonderful moment
you've come into my life''

2
00:01:06,218 --> 00:01:11,679
''Wonder what world
you come from''

3
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:18,521
''You remind me
of the forgotten past''

4
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:25,192
''You have taken over
my very being''

5
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:34,678
''Like a wonderful moment
you've come into my life''

6
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:41,216
''Are you for real?
Or an illusion?''

7
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,219
''You remind me
of the forgotten past''

8
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,230
''You have invaded
my very being''

9
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:07,839
''l'm still the same,
so is the moment''

10
00:02:08,914 --> 00:02:14,614
''Yet, never was
this frenzy before''

11
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:27,462
''Your heartbeat is fragrant''

12
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:34,202
''l'm lost in your love''

13
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,644
''Like a wonderful moment
you've come into my life''

14
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,209
''Wonder what world
you come from''

15
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:53,657
''You remind me
of the forgotten past''

16
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:00,825
''You have invaded
my very being''

17
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:14,472
John would laugh when l used
to write my diary. He'd say...

18
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:18,678
the past is meant to be forgotten,
not to be remembered

19
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,187
How can l forget the days
l spent with him?

20
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:26,791
l loved him dearly...

21
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:30,894
though l knew
he was a contract killer

22
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:38,464
l wish he hadn't picked up the gun
for the first time, then perhaps...!

23
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:23,505
Thus John was sucked into
the vicious circle of crime

24
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:28,338
l'm not the only one eyeing this
500-acre land. Yunus too is

25
00:05:29,214 --> 00:05:31,182
Only a politician can do this job

26
00:05:31,883 --> 00:05:34,443
l trusted Trivedi, and...

27
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,188
lf he doesn't agree?
- Well...

28
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:40,783
if he doesn't,
l'll spare him

29
00:05:42,227 --> 00:05:46,527
Why, you don't trust me?
- Trust you? l do

30
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:48,521
Greetings, Captain

31
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:54,797
Mr Trivedi, l'm angry with you.
- Why?

32
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:59,274
Javed is threatening my people.
He got my dealers...

33
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:01,738
in Malaysia and Hong Kong bumped off

34
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:06,473
And you are joining hands with him.
So unfair, Trivedi

35
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:10,150
You are my friend, aren't you?
- Of course...

36
00:06:10,522 --> 00:06:13,150
l'm your friend, Captain.
You are right

37
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:16,683
Good you asked me.
- l know

38
00:06:17,195 --> 00:06:19,720
Hope you don't intend to severe ties?
- Oh no

39
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:26,169
Well, l don't recognise you.
- l'm sorry

40
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:28,831
My son. John.
- Strange, Captain

41
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,601
You never told me you had a family.
- Who told you that?

42
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:35,179
lsn't this my family?

43
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:37,578
lsn't Farid family?

44
00:06:38,216 --> 00:06:41,515
Well, l didn't call you over
to introduce you to my family...

45
00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:44,184
but to ask you about the land deal

46
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,893
You see... that land is disputed

47
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:54,189
We've bought many such plots from you,
did you encounter any problem?

48
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:58,496
This time too, you won't.
l'll pay the full amount right away

49
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:01,565
Farid, advance!
- Oh no. Listen to me, Captain

50
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:05,631
lt's not a matter of money.
Please try to understand

51
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:11,672
Give me some time.
- ls it that Yunus is vying...?

52
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:14,743
No, not Yunus

53
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:17,745
Javed.
- l see

54
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:20,519
Javed is full-bloodedly
seeking that land

55
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,495
Forgive me, Captain, but
l think l won't be able to help you

56
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:34,330
Shit!

57
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:41,706
ls there any thing else l can do?
- Oh, Mr Trivedi...

58
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,174
what else?
You failed to deliver

59
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:51,649
Do this little job for me.
- Tell me, l'll do it right away

60
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:57,194
l wanted some fodder for the fish

61
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:02,131
Where do you want it from?

62
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:06,733
From? You have it

63
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:09,840
Just a little...
- What are you upto...?

64
00:08:13,177 --> 00:08:15,145
Captain, you're insane!

65
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:28,481
See, John? People have
such strange hobbies

66
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:33,493
Fishing is my hobby,
being the bait is his

67
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,630
l dropped several hints,
but he didn't agree

68
00:08:40,204 --> 00:08:42,502
l guess Javed too
shares his hobby

69
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:47,538
He's going to Singapore tomorrow,
to meet Anna

70
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:49,744
He won't

71
00:08:58,222 --> 00:08:59,382
Bull...

72
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:04,593
here's a riddle. Two gates in a zoo,
one bigger than the other

73
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:10,132
A deer walks out of the small gate
and gets in from the bigger one. Why?

74
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,400
The small gate is probably shut
after he leaves

75
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:15,739
No

76
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:19,541
Maybe the gate's height...?
- When he returns...

77
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:22,573
he sees a wild animal at the gate,
a lion perhaps...

78
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:26,149
No.
- Pass. Tell us John

79
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:28,814
lt's the deer's wish.
He can come and go anywhere he wants

80
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:32,150
Shit!
- Bullshit

81
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,818
Can't find it!
- What?

82
00:09:38,196 --> 00:09:40,562
Film ticket... gotcha

83
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,636
lt's a Sushmita Sen movie.
My Sushmita

84
00:09:46,204 --> 00:09:48,365
Which show?
- First show obviously, stupid

85
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:51,166
First show? Are you crazy?
How will you get there?

86
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:53,338
What's the big deal?

87
00:09:53,578 --> 00:09:56,706
Enter an empty house, wait a while,
boss will play golf, and soon we leave

88
00:09:57,215 --> 00:09:58,182
Simple

89
00:10:00,218 --> 00:10:04,678
Aishwarya! l love Aishwarya!
What a body, what a face!

90
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:09,853
So my little Bulbul,
why don't you profess your love?

91
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:12,861
l had the idea. Then l thought
if she marries me...

92
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:17,759
the film industry will be ruined.
l can't bear to see others in pain

93
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:20,465
Let's go

94
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:23,965
l will buy nice-nice toys
and chocolates for my daughters

95
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:26,205
Did you enjoy the holidays?
- Yes

96
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:31,647
l think she's crying, Papa
- Diya...

97
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:33,945
She's crying

98
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:36,616
l think you should give her
all the toys, Papa

99
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:38,786
What will you have then?
- lt's okay

100
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:02,439
Wow! So handsome

101
00:11:18,296 --> 00:11:19,763
Hat, Kaif

102
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:24,699
Cannon, Kaif

103
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:28,933
Gun... two guns

104
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:52,222
l'll open the lift door.
- No, l will

105
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:56,663
So Javed is going to Singapore today!
- Singapore called off

106
00:11:57,268 --> 00:12:00,328
He's going straight to heaven.
- Yunus will receive a great shock

107
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:03,434
Shock? He'll die of shock

108
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:09,441
You don't look like a bull in any way.
Who christened you Bull, and why?

109
00:12:10,214 --> 00:12:12,705
Ask my pop after you die. Okay?

110
00:12:14,218 --> 00:12:17,654
Bulbul is an apt name boss gave you.
- Enough of jokes

111
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:52,623
Shall l take the shot, John?

112
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:54,552
Will you?

113
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:06,602
Javed will be on target only for
five seconds. lf you miss...

114
00:13:06,938 --> 00:13:08,667
My aim's not that bad, okay?

115
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:23,581
Diya, come on...

116
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,647
Move!

117
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:15,495
Uncle...

118
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:35,176
Come on, John... we must leave

119
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:42,715
C'mon, John !

120
00:16:07,852 --> 00:16:10,150
C'mon, forgive me now, Kaif.
What's wrong with you?

121
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:11,879
l'm fine

122
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:21,164
Bumped off four others
along with Javed, eh?

123
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,731
One-for-one-free scheme!

124
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:26,837
But you'll be paid only for one

125
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:29,940
lt was written that
the house was empty

126
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,170
True. The family was supposed
to arrive next week...

127
00:16:35,946 --> 00:16:37,914
but turned up suddenly. So?

128
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:41,613
Which means you knew about it.
- My mistake

129
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:47,356
Shall l shoot...?

130
00:16:48,826 --> 00:16:50,623
and say l goofed?

131
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:53,454
Forget it, John.
- Let him go

132
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:04,371
Never make this mistake again

133
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:07,943
Before l do, get out!

134
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:20,713
l'm sorry to hear about Javed...

135
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:24,153
Enough.
- Captain made a mistake

136
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,656
He's done wrong, Yunus-bhai

137
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:31,628
l can't take it anymore. lnitially
he asked for a share in the business

138
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,895
And now he demands money
in the drug deals

139
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:37,859
Though it was peanuts,
we still used get a share before

140
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:42,661
Not the same anymore. When Bhatia
and Kapoor demanded their share...

141
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:47,166
he said the consignment was seized.
- lt's not in the police records

142
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:50,839
Yunus-bhai, you must avenge
Javed's death

143
00:18:51,448 --> 00:18:55,179
All of us stand to gain
with Captain's death

144
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,580
And Kapoor? What does he say?

145
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,890
He wouldn't come here
to face Verma

146
00:19:03,627 --> 00:19:07,222
Well, l spoke to him at the golf club.
He also wants Captain dead

147
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,135
Captain's done me a lot of favours

148
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:16,799
Looks like it's time to repay...

149
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,133
the debt

150
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:23,470
This way, sir

151
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,583
Take everyone's statements, be warm.
And seal off the area

152
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:31,285
l will

153
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:33,653
How long have you known him?

154
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:00,450
Good God!

155
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:02,843
He was a Major, sir.
Nagesh Thakur

156
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:08,686
They were away on a month's holiday,
supposed to return next week...

157
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:14,464
came back early to attend
someone's wedding

158
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:19,200
Who was at home?
- Major Nagesh...

159
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:21,571
his wife and a little kid

160
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,537
Two kids

161
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:02,345
D'you have chocolates?
- No, sir

162
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:08,682
Nice doll

163
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:13,620
l have a doll too, see

164
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:19,189
Why don't we exchange our dolls?

165
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,197
Don't worry, my child... no problem.
Look...

166
00:21:32,776 --> 00:21:35,210
l'll keep it here.
- Her name is Diya

167
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:40,876
Know what? l got a little daughter,
just like you

168
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:43,653
D'you know her name?

169
00:21:44,588 --> 00:21:48,718
Her name's Piya.
Look, l got her picture

170
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:50,754
Look

171
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:54,560
Who's sweeter? You tell me

172
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:57,898
You? Or Piya?

173
00:21:58,602 --> 00:21:59,830
Take

174
00:22:08,645 --> 00:22:10,442
Great job, sir!

175
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:13,616
That evening when John came
to pick me up...

176
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:16,749
l knew from his eyes
that something had gone wrong

177
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:47,206
''Every heart has a desire''

178
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:56,282
''One just needs to realise''

179
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:10,162
''Every little element...''

180
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:16,168
''appears to radiate''

181
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:12,167
''An unknown intoxication
grips my heart''

182
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:18,166
''A fading dream
flares up again''

183
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:24,173
''This feeling, this consolation...''

184
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:29,674
''is this love?''

185
00:24:31,822 --> 00:24:34,188
''This feeling, this consolation...''

186
00:24:34,658 --> 00:24:37,183
''is this love...?''

187
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:41,894
''question my skipping heartbeats''

188
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:48,530
''Every little element...''

189
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:54,506
''appears to radiate''

190
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:59,545
''Every heart has a desire''

191
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:10,151
''Oh, for someone who'd realise''

192
00:25:23,674 --> 00:25:27,770
Listen to me first.
There were so many idiots around

193
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:31,513
Did you see the baldie sitting there?
Over there

194
00:25:31,882 --> 00:25:33,782
You saw him, didn't you?
Guess what he did?

195
00:25:34,217 --> 00:25:37,186
He fished out his visiting card,
gave it to me and asked...

196
00:25:37,554 --> 00:25:40,182
''D'you sing at private parties?''
l denied it

197
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:43,785
He questioned me thrice,
and thrice l denied it

198
00:25:44,394 --> 00:25:47,386
Then guess what l did?
l showed him the finger

199
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:51,860
His expression was worth watching.
He didn't know what to do

200
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,197
That's funny, John.
- Yeah

201
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:58,433
Why aren't you smiling, dear?
Are you all right?

202
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:00,200
l'm fine

203
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:03,142
l've taken leave till the 15th

204
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:07,309
Why?
- What do you mean why?

205
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:10,153
Why would l take a leave?

206
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:14,154
You can't afford to stay there, didn't
l tell you? Guess why l told you?

207
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:18,485
What's on the 15th?
- l don't remember

208
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:24,167
You don't remember?

209
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:26,834
Shalini, l don't remember
anything tonight

210
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:30,504
Don't you really know
what's on this 15th?

211
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:34,177
l don't remember

212
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:35,839
Sure?

213
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:42,515
On the 15th of this month is the
3rd anniversary of our first meeting

214
00:26:43,553 --> 00:26:45,783
How could you forget that?
- l'm sorry

215
00:26:47,557 --> 00:26:49,855
That cute sorry
deserves to be forgiven

216
00:26:52,396 --> 00:26:56,196
Nothing doing till the 15th.
You're not going away, neither am l

217
00:26:57,234 --> 00:26:59,202
Only you and me!

218
00:27:00,237 --> 00:27:02,467
Your favourite wine
is inside the refrigerator

219
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,807
l've sent Laxmi on leave too

220
00:27:05,242 --> 00:27:07,710
We'll wine, dine
and have fun, what say?

221
00:27:08,512 --> 00:27:10,810
Don't sit... l got to
show you something

222
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,476
Come here

223
00:27:14,518 --> 00:27:16,315
See this bud, John?

224
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,487
Should we water it everyday,
it'll bloom...

225
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:23,153
on the 15th, on our anniversary

226
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:27,163
lsn't that romantic?

227
00:27:33,437 --> 00:27:35,405
Where are you lost?

228
00:27:36,273 --> 00:27:38,173
Did you have anything since morning?

229
00:27:39,009 --> 00:27:41,603
Please don't nod like that!
lt reminds me of that manager

230
00:27:42,612 --> 00:27:44,773
Yes or no, say it clearly

231
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:48,514
Actually, the poor guy
whined today...

232
00:27:48,952 --> 00:27:51,944
when l told him l won't sing
till the 15th...

233
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:55,184
and if l do sing,
it'll only be for my dear hubby

234
00:27:57,027 --> 00:27:59,791
He said, ''You'll get your salary
minus 15,000''

235
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,794
Can you imagine? Had he said
no leave, then...

236
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:07,796
Please pass that rag, John

237
00:28:08,171 --> 00:28:09,729
''Special Coverage.
lndia's Budget''

238
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,138
When we'll have a house
of our own...

239
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:17,305
we'll have plants on all sides.
lnside as well as outside

240
00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:23,851
Big windows... cool breeze coming
through, curtains flying...

241
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:30,756
And the floor will be granite.
l cannot handle wood and all

242
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:33,685
''Breaking News''

243
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:36,632
Can you imagine...?

244
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:39,469
just you and me

245
00:28:40,337 --> 00:28:42,305
On the beach...

246
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:46,909
by the deep blue waters...

247
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:49,678
huge waves...

248
00:28:52,215 --> 00:28:54,183
l can almost hear it

249
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:57,182
We're reporting from
Challenger building

250
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:01,586
This is the house of Major Thakur
and his innocent family...

251
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:04,792
who were brutally murdered.
The police have no lead yet

252
00:29:05,428 --> 00:29:07,396
What's wrong, honey?

253
00:29:08,198 --> 00:29:10,462
lf not me, who else will you tell?

254
00:29:16,573 --> 00:29:19,133
The only survivor is a seven-year-old
innocent child Diya...

255
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:21,310
who survived by hiding on top
of an air-conditioner

256
00:29:21,578 --> 00:29:25,139
The police are investigating whether
Major Thakur had any previous enmity

257
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,598
lt was a simple plan

258
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,669
Suddenly there was a noise

259
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,936
But l committed a mistake.
A grave mistake

260
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,510
Out of the blue
she appeared before me

261
00:30:00,584 --> 00:30:04,782
The innocent child had no idea
she was facing her death

262
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:15,186
ln just 30 seconds,
the entire family...!

263
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:22,204
The happy, cheerful family!

264
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:25,575
An ominous knell resonated
in my ears

265
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,537
Her hands were going cold

266
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,885
When l open my eyes...

267
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,221
l see their faces

268
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:42,224
When l shut them...

269
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,627
l hear them scream

270
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:01,276
Shalini, please understand me

271
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:06,749
Will you give me a hug?

272
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,186
Please help us find them.
Your names, addresses...

273
00:31:14,491 --> 00:31:16,459
and all details
will be kept secret

274
00:31:17,227 --> 00:31:19,195
l'm sorry, Shalini

275
00:31:19,663 --> 00:31:20,857
l'm sorry

276
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:28,802
Seeking forgiveness
and forgiving...

277
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:31,207
won't make any difference

278
00:31:33,677 --> 00:31:37,545
Had you quit the job,
this wouldn't have happened

279
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:43,919
We just have to move on

280
00:32:00,637 --> 00:32:03,162
Let's go away... far away

281
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,198
Captain wants to
talk to you, Mr Yunus

282
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,198
Yunus, did you get the flowers?

283
00:33:43,907 --> 00:33:45,875
Thank you very much, bro

284
00:33:48,011 --> 00:33:49,876
Thanks a million

285
00:33:50,513 --> 00:33:53,744
l hear you after so long,
l'm so unfortunate

286
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:58,551
And look at your good fortune,
though for a short period...

287
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,315
Allah gives you
a new lease of life

288
00:34:03,226 --> 00:34:05,660
Yunus, the flowers
are not for Javed...

289
00:34:07,197 --> 00:34:09,165
it's meant for your coffin

290
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:11,490
Oh, dear bro...

291
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:15,396
no emperor, no king,
no prince survive

292
00:34:16,005 --> 00:34:19,168
lt's a misconception that
you will stick to the throne, why?

293
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,375
Give those tough bones some rest.
lt's time for you to retire

294
00:34:27,217 --> 00:34:30,448
Yunus, l'll fix you
and all those creeps...

295
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:34,646
who think that the Captain's ship
is sinking

296
00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:39,718
And yes Yunus, don't worry,
you won't be lonely

297
00:34:41,231 --> 00:34:43,859
l'll send over some friends
for company

298
00:36:20,196 --> 00:36:22,494
Why can't we take
everything along?

299
00:36:26,202 --> 00:36:28,500
l can't leave like this, Shalini

300
00:36:29,472 --> 00:36:31,440
l'll going to tell
the police everything

301
00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:35,734
What do you think?
The police will let you go?

302
00:36:36,212 --> 00:36:38,180
And suppose the police
even let you off...

303
00:36:38,348 --> 00:36:39,838
are they going to spare you?

304
00:36:39,983 --> 00:36:42,508
Had you been in my shoes...
- But l am in your shoes, John !

305
00:36:43,252 --> 00:36:47,621
Round the clock! Have you ever
considered what l'm going through?

306
00:36:50,226 --> 00:36:52,592
lf we run for it and
something happens to you...?

307
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:56,921
What if something happens to you?
Let's be done with it

308
00:36:58,234 --> 00:37:00,794
We're getting out of here in
15 minutes. 15 minutes!

309
00:37:02,572 --> 00:37:05,803
We can then think with a calm mind.
Please, John...

310
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,478
Sub-lnspector Naik here.
- l want to talk to ACP Wagh

311
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,816
What is it regarding?
- He's the one l'll tell

312
00:37:17,353 --> 00:37:20,151
Who's calling?
- Give him the phone

313
00:37:20,523 --> 00:37:22,753
He's in a meeting with the
Commissioner. Any message?

314
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,691
Let's leave now. We can try later

315
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:41,667
There was an attack on the Captain.
He's called you over

316
00:37:42,378 --> 00:37:44,175
l'll come later

317
00:37:45,214 --> 00:37:48,843
He wants you over right now.
l've been asked to bring you

318
00:37:51,788 --> 00:37:55,349
You can talk it over with him.
- Hang on for a moment

319
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:10,138
l love you

320
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:16,838
On the seashore...
just you and me

321
00:38:24,454 --> 00:38:26,820
Before they're released,
his funeral will be arranged

322
00:38:27,557 --> 00:38:29,752
That's okay, but l have
just one question

323
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:34,492
Will the job really be done?
There should be no problem

324
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:36,865
You are talking to
the Captain himself!

325
00:38:41,204 --> 00:38:43,502
Are you okay?
- Yes

326
00:38:45,608 --> 00:38:49,704
Now look; no more compromises,
meetings or discussions. Only action

327
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:54,345
You're going to love it, John.
We've got to bump off Yunus

328
00:38:55,284 --> 00:38:58,515
Not right away. We've first
got to eliminate the guys...

329
00:38:59,722 --> 00:39:02,122
who're showing Yunus dreams
of becoming the Captain

330
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:05,385
You're gonna love this job, John.
You're going to love it

331
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:09,128
That's okay.
Kaif and Bull will handle it

332
00:39:09,532 --> 00:39:12,126
No. You alone are
going to do the job

333
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:16,697
Kaif and Bull will be around,
but you'll have to pull it off

334
00:39:21,177 --> 00:39:23,611
Now don't tell me the idea of
killing Yunus scares you

335
00:39:24,547 --> 00:39:27,141
No.
- C'mon, son

336
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,818
As usual, let's shake hands

337
00:39:30,586 --> 00:39:32,417
l'm quitting the racket

338
00:39:46,536 --> 00:39:48,834
You're turning me down.
Correct?

339
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:57,702
And what reason...?
- Shalini and l...

340
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:02,177
are getting out of the city.
- Where will you go? And do what?

341
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:06,614
Get into farming? Graze cattle?
Run a poultry farm?

342
00:40:07,223 --> 00:40:10,192
What are you going to do?
Don't be a romantic fool!

343
00:40:15,598 --> 00:40:20,194
Now look, John. Had you told me
about this even two days ago...

344
00:40:21,571 --> 00:40:23,539
l'd have personally
seen you off

345
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,608
But not today

346
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,905
l consider you to be my son, John

347
00:40:31,647 --> 00:40:36,380
And now when the father's attacked,
is the son going to show his back?

348
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:38,552
No way, no

349
00:40:38,788 --> 00:40:40,551
l don't want any...
- Sit down !

350
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:56,899
People are scared of you.
Because you possess a gun

351
00:40:57,607 --> 00:40:59,575
They're scared because you
carry a gun, John

352
00:41:01,477 --> 00:41:08,178
And people are scared of me
because l have money, power...

353
00:41:08,517 --> 00:41:09,779
and you

354
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:15,521
People who have nothing,
go around begging for favours

355
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:27,658
And the others,
people with power...

356
00:41:28,271 --> 00:41:30,705
do as they please

357
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,538
They do anything goddamn thing
they want to!

358
00:41:41,651 --> 00:41:43,881
Get those silly ideas
out of your mind

359
00:41:45,254 --> 00:41:46,881
C'mon... come

360
00:41:54,797 --> 00:41:57,231
This is the last time
l'm shaking hands with you

361
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:01,498
We're not going
to meet ever again

362
00:42:12,214 --> 00:42:15,377
You will come back to me, John.
You really will

363
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:20,347
Because the world outside isn't as
romantic as you imagine it to be

364
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:22,190
John !

365
00:42:25,227 --> 00:42:26,524
Good luck

366
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:34,668
What could l do, if not turn him down?
l don't want this job anymore

367
00:42:35,037 --> 00:42:37,528
You know, the Captain doesn't
like ''no'' for an answer

368
00:42:38,341 --> 00:42:40,809
He'd better get used to it.
- Try and understand, John

369
00:42:41,344 --> 00:42:44,211
You know what Captain did to Fakru
for just a little thing...

370
00:42:45,681 --> 00:42:47,478
What's wrong with the car?
What are you upto?

371
00:42:47,683 --> 00:42:50,811
Who's Fakru? And what's with him?
- lt happened before you arrived

372
00:42:52,254 --> 00:42:55,485
He refused the Captain too.
The Captain used his sword...

373
00:42:57,026 --> 00:42:59,392
and Fakru was beheaded.
That's the Captain

374
00:43:01,597 --> 00:43:03,929
The Captain's not in the habit
of taking ''no'' for an answer

375
00:43:08,204 --> 00:43:12,163
l know what dangers lie ahead.
- lt's okay then

376
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:15,277
As soon as possible...
- That's what l'll do

377
00:43:15,678 --> 00:43:17,646
Mind if l say something?

378
00:43:18,547 --> 00:43:21,311
lt's just a matter of two days.
The Captain will have a job done...

379
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:24,178
and there won't be any danger
to you or Shalini either

380
00:43:25,221 --> 00:43:30,557
Nobody's going to know.
- Me...? Won't l get to know either?

381
00:43:32,928 --> 00:43:34,623
l got to leave with Shalini right now

382
00:43:35,965 --> 00:43:37,933
Just a minute.
l'm almost through

383
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:20,834
Very lonely without Shalini
around in the house, isn't it?

384
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:25,847
What's she worth anyway?
You're so lucky

385
00:44:26,549 --> 00:44:28,847
l thought she was all alone
and so l called her over

386
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:32,519
Shalini and l are going to spend
the next two days together...

387
00:44:32,688 --> 00:44:34,588
and say so much to each other

388
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:38,183
Where's Shalini?

389
00:44:39,495 --> 00:44:42,259
l want to talk to Shalini.
Now... this moment!

390
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:43,732
Shut up!

391
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:50,198
Captain ! Where is Shalini?

392
00:44:58,314 --> 00:45:00,680
The poor girl doesn't even know
that we have kidnapped her

393
00:45:00,883 --> 00:45:04,148
John... is that you?
Hello...

394
00:45:05,855 --> 00:45:09,313
Where are you? Are you okay?

395
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:12,484
The manager said there
was some danger...

396
00:45:12,895 --> 00:45:15,659
and you... you even left
your cell-phone at home

397
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:19,163
Where are you right now?
- l'm just taking a precaution

398
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:21,530
l'm getting a friend of mine
to make passports for us

399
00:45:21,871 --> 00:45:26,331
l want you to remain there so
you will not be in any kind of danger

400
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:31,179
Are you telling me the truth?
- Trust me, Shalini

401
00:45:32,248 --> 00:45:38,187
l do. Where can l find you then?
- Don't worry about me

402
00:45:38,988 --> 00:45:42,355
How am l not to worry? You ought to
have told me that l had to come here

403
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:46,689
Listen... will you do me a favour?

404
00:45:48,564 --> 00:45:51,362
Can you go home?
- What for?

405
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:55,698
l think l forgot to switch off
the geyser

406
00:45:56,972 --> 00:45:57,939
Okay

407
00:45:59,275 --> 00:46:01,140
And listen... if you're going home...

408
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:07,146
please water my plant.
lt'll die if you don't water it

409
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,819
lt will be taken care of.
You take care of yourself

410
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,688
Where's my kiss...?

411
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,728
ls everything all right?

412
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:22,656
l somehow don't like it

413
00:46:23,899 --> 00:46:25,662
Don't worry

414
00:46:28,537 --> 00:46:30,505
Nothing will happen to you

415
00:46:31,907 --> 00:46:34,637
l love you.
- l love you, too

416
00:46:36,478 --> 00:46:38,446
Bye, love.
- Bye

417
00:46:46,322 --> 00:46:50,986
l give you my word
Bring those five guys here...

418
00:46:52,962 --> 00:46:55,863
and take your sweetheart away

419
00:47:00,836 --> 00:47:03,134
When you bump off one of them...

420
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:09,141
you'll get to talk to your
sweetheart again. Deal?

421
00:47:09,778 --> 00:47:11,643
lf something happens
to my sweetheart...

422
00:47:14,316 --> 00:47:15,806
l will kill you

423
00:47:18,187 --> 00:47:21,156
When, whom and how...
it's all explained in this

424
00:47:33,535 --> 00:47:36,663
Take my advise, bro.
Don't...

425
00:47:37,506 --> 00:47:41,169
your girl... l mean,
it's too risky, bro

426
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,189
Anything new?

427
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:03,122
l still say, let's do as Captain says..
- Speak up

428
00:50:00,282 --> 00:50:02,682
Where's Shalini? Tell me, quick!
- You're going to kill me...?

429
00:50:03,952 --> 00:50:05,852
Shalini's also going to die then

430
00:50:12,761 --> 00:50:15,696
Captain, you've won the bet

431
00:50:16,565 --> 00:50:19,193
This crazy guy's really come
to save Shalini

432
00:50:24,973 --> 00:50:26,201
Watch it, John

433
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:29,208
Save this anger and obsession
to kill those five guys

434
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:31,442
And don't waste any more time

435
00:50:32,948 --> 00:50:35,712
Before Shalini's turned into
fodder for the fish...

436
00:50:36,418 --> 00:50:38,545
go away, my boy. Just go

437
00:50:40,355 --> 00:50:44,223
Try and remember something.
You've looked into his eyes

438
00:50:44,927 --> 00:50:46,224
What were his eyes like?

439
00:51:05,214 --> 00:51:09,275
We got no time to lose.
We must pull it off at the earliest

440
00:51:11,453 --> 00:51:14,513
There's no way we can refuse...
- You needn't say that, Bull

441
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:22,694
lt's not an easy job, bro

442
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:30,504
Any reckless step can increase
the danger to sis-in-law

443
00:51:46,788 --> 00:51:48,756
Let's go through the plan

444
00:51:53,428 --> 00:51:58,229
Yunus lsmail. Holed up in a room
on the top-floor of his hotel

445
00:51:59,801 --> 00:52:03,168
His guards, posing as staff,
keeping vigil

446
00:52:06,642 --> 00:52:08,610
The hotel's being watched
round the clock

447
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:17,185
Patil

448
00:52:18,754 --> 00:52:22,520
The bloody cop.
- Go on

449
00:52:23,892 --> 00:52:28,192
lnder Kapoor. National lndustries.
- Surrounded by guards...

450
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:32,192
shuttles between his factory and
house in a bullet-proof car

451
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:34,535
Goes out to play golf occasionally

452
00:52:37,773 --> 00:52:43,211
Verma. Has taken a bullet earlier.
But eventually escaped

453
00:52:45,747 --> 00:52:49,205
Has his office right at home.
Remains hidden like a rat

454
00:52:49,785 --> 00:52:52,015
Always surrounded by guards.
Always

455
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:58,548
Bhatia. Leads a life of luxury

456
00:53:00,062 --> 00:53:02,656
Has his work-outs with the Minister
in his secure gym

457
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:05,823
Guards, there too

458
00:53:06,435 --> 00:53:09,666
Goes jogging every morning.
Has an office at Nariman Point

459
00:53:10,439 --> 00:53:12,407
With tight security.
Seems impossible

460
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:16,644
l got to make it possible.
Where will be Bhatia be right now?

461
00:53:17,512 --> 00:53:18,479
Nariman Point

462
00:53:19,348 --> 00:53:20,315
Let's go

463
00:53:31,693 --> 00:53:33,854
Hurry up.
- John, he'll get away. Hurry

464
00:53:40,702 --> 00:53:43,262
The kid?
- Kid...?

465
00:53:45,907 --> 00:53:48,705
Where's the kid, John?
There's no kid there

466
00:53:48,877 --> 00:53:50,435
John, he's getting away!

467
00:53:53,482 --> 00:53:55,450
What the hell are you doing, John?

468
00:53:56,251 --> 00:53:58,219
That was the last chance!

469
00:54:00,255 --> 00:54:02,883
We can now find Bhatia only at his
new babe's nightclub tonight

470
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:09,160
Security is said to be tight there.
But l'm sure we'll manage it, John

471
00:54:09,331 --> 00:54:11,299
l don't know how,
but we'll do it

472
00:54:11,733 --> 00:54:15,169
Looks like orders from higher ups.
ACP Wagh is personally protecting him

473
00:54:16,405 --> 00:54:19,340
And if John doesn't kill Bhatia,
Captain's going to be offended

474
00:54:39,728 --> 00:54:42,196
A little inconvenience for me
would cause agony to John

475
00:54:43,398 --> 00:54:47,698
That's something not just l knew.
Captain knew it, too

476
00:55:13,862 --> 00:55:15,659
Yes, Captain?
- Kaif?

477
00:55:18,366 --> 00:55:23,668
Ask your friend just how many more
sins he's going to make me commit

478
00:55:28,376 --> 00:55:32,176
Well, never mind. Tell him
that there's no time to lose.

479
00:55:33,014 --> 00:55:35,175
You get that?
- Yes

480
00:56:02,177 --> 00:56:04,475
Good evening, sir. How are you?
- l'm fine, thank you

481
00:56:08,383 --> 00:56:10,817
Officer, there's no need for
the police in there

482
00:56:11,419 --> 00:56:13,387
We have enough security, please

483
00:56:13,855 --> 00:56:16,153
No suspicious character would even
dream of getting in there

484
00:56:16,725 --> 00:56:19,489
Don't worry, sir.
- But l can't take chances

485
00:56:46,321 --> 00:56:49,188
''To love, you dance!''

486
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:15,143
''Every sorrow,
it turns into a song...''

487
00:57:15,917 --> 00:57:21,150
''the heartstrings,
it plays on...''

488
00:57:22,757 --> 00:57:28,161
''hide as l try to...''

489
00:57:28,697 --> 00:57:35,159
''love makes me dance''

490
00:58:04,332 --> 00:58:07,130
''A high, it's a high !''

491
00:58:07,702 --> 00:58:10,637
''A wave of colours unknown''

492
00:58:14,509 --> 00:58:17,478
''lt's a venom the
the heart loathes''
