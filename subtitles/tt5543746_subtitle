1
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,440
Hey!

2
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,880
Enjoy!

3
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,440
I shall narrate
the story of Lord Ram.

4
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,840
The story of the God
who resides within us.

5
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,800
The story of the son of
King Dashrath, Ram.

6
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,640
The story of Kaushalya's
beloved son, Ram.

7
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,280
The story of Lakshman,
Shatrughna

8
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,960
and Bharat's brother, Ram.

9
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,640
The story of Sita's husband,
Lord Ram.

10
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,160
When His step-mother, Kaikeyi

11
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,320
deceived Ram for
the love of his son

12
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,160
He accepted 14 years of exile
in order to fulfil His promise.

13
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,320
He left along with
Sita and Lakshman.

14
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,400
He gave up everything.

15
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,680
Ravana's sister, Shurpanakha

16
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
had fallen for Lord Ram.

17
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,920
Lakshman cut her nose

18
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,040
upon seeing her ill-behaviour.

19
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,360
Ravana was the king of Lanka.

20
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,960
He wished to have Goddess Sita.

21
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,120
He played a deadly game.

22
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,440
He took the path of deceit.

23
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,320
Ravana abducted Sita

24
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,560
and brought Her to Lanka.

25
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,520
Lord Ram was powerful
and a great archer.

26
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,520
He made Him fight.

27
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,280
Lanka was made of gold.

28
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,640
Ram was a forest dweller.

29
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,000
He only wished to seek justice.

30
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,760
And He had a small army of apes.

31
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,440
Yet Lord Ram wasn't scared.

32
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,600
He fought with Ravana.

33
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,880
He killed the demon.

34
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,960
He punished him for
his evil deeds.

35
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,320
I shall narrate
the story of Lord Ram.

36
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,600
The story of the Lord
who resides within us.

37
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,120
The lesson we learn
from this story is

38
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,080
that it's not impossible
to defeat Ravana.

39
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,880
But one needs to awaken
the Ram within oneself.

40
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,320
Now, I would like to invite
our Chief Minister

41
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Mr. Govardhan Malik,
on the stage

42
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
and encourage our children.

43
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,240
Well done.

44
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,520
Very nice.

45
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,640
Well done.

46
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,720
Good evening.

47
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,240
Hello, children.

48
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,280
Well done.

49
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,080
Celebrating the annual day
on 'Dussehra'

50
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,600
is a great idea.

51
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,080
My son studied in this school

52
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,680
due to which

53
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,640
he is a successful and a
civilised citizen. - Over there.

54
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,120
How long will this go on for?

55
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,520
Let's see.

56
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,200
Is it done?

57
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,280
The first prize goes
to grade 10-C.

58
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,360
Forget about her.
Look at the girl in pink.

59
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,320
Do you know her?

60
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,240
She's my neighbour.
- We know it.

61
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
There's no way you'll get her.

62
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,200
She is quite different,
isn't she?

63
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,480
Lock it.

64
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,080
Mom, let's click a selfie.

65
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,440
Yes.

66
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,400
That's enough.
Now, fasten your seatbelt.

67
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,600
Come on, fasten your seatbelt.

68
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,280
Come on, Mom.
The car isn't moving.

69
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,960
It's okay.

70
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,520
Hello?
- Hello.

71
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,360
Ritu!
Thank God you picked up.

72
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,760
What happened?

73
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,680
Didn't your husband
answer your call?

74
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,000
The exhibition is around
the corner.

75
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,400
I have so much work to do.
My God!

76
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,080
And I am so stressed out.

77
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,520
Despite taking sleeping pills

78
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,680
I am unable to sleep.

79
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,400
And tell me something.

80
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,840
I am done with the renovation
of my house.

81
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,840
When will you come to see it?

82
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,440
I will come soon.

83
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,800
But right now, I am stuck
in a huge traffic jam.

84
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,960
Tia is with me.
- At this time?

85
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,760
She had her
annual function today.

86
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
And Her Highness has won

87
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,440
the best project of
the year award again.

88
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,920
Wow!
But I am not surprised.

89
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,360
She is a rock star.

90
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,520
Just a minute.

91
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,720
I'll put you on speaker.

92
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,880
Hold on.
- Hey, rock star! How are you?

93
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,120
Congratulations!

94
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,360
Thank you, Aunt!

95
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,520
Why did you address me
as aunt?

96
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,760
Actually, mom is with me.
So..

97
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,480
I tell you..
Your mom is so boring.

98
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,920
Inder, this is the car, right?
- Yes.

99
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,840
Ritu, do you know any
alternate way to our house?

100
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,960
Turn on the GPS.

101
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,480
Dear, turn on the GPS.

102
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,120
Mom, do it on your phone.

103
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,640
This is..
- My phone is with you.

104
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,440
Mom, please. Turn it on.

105
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,520
Yes. So, mom helped me a lot.

106
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,520
Seriously..

107
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,280
You know my friends,
Meenal and Sonam, don't you?

108
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,720
Both of them had participated.

109
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,800
Even they worked very hard.

110
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,840
Where does the left from
Ramleela Maidan lead to?

111
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,720
Turn on the GPS.

112
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,400
Gosh! I have turned it on.

113
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,160
But I don't understand anything.

114
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,080
I can't..

115
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,280
Oh!

116
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,920
Maybe some construction
work is in process.

117
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,840
Anyway, why do you worry?

118
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,080
I did gift you a pen knife
for your safety.

119
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,840
Your pen knife is
really helpful.

120
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,600
Mom, we must keep going.

121
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,080
We may find a way..

122
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,200
Your daughter is more sensible
than you.

123
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,960
Definitely. - Tia, we have
to celebrate, okay?

124
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,880
Of course.

125
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,360
Tia!

126
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,280
Hey! Tia!

127
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,000
Tia!

128
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,000
Hurry up..
- Can you hear me?

129
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,360
Hello..
- Get down.

130
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,080
Move aside.
- Vidya, can you hear me?

131
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,240
She was supposed
to be in this car.

132
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,840
Yes.
- Where is she?

133
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,080
Bring her out. - Hurry up.
- Of course it'll do.

134
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,000
How?
- It's not her.

135
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,040
Hey!

136
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,240
Here we are! Stop..
- Wait..

137
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,600
Hold her..

138
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,760
Hold her..

139
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,240
Hurry up.
- Sikander, do this.

140
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,520
Careful.
- I'll hold her.

141
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,400
Come on, start the car.

142
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,400
Get in the car.
- Put her in. - Hurry up.

143
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,760
It's not premium stuff.

144
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,040
Something is better
than nothing.

145
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,280
Get in the car.
- Let's go.

146
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,200
Come on, let's go.

147
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,120
Let's go from here.

148
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,480
I can manage with anything,
right?

149
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,760
What have you done?

150
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,240
It just happened.

151
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,600
What are you doing?
- Darn it!

152
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,800
You..

153
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,200
Darn it!

154
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,480
Check..

155
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,200
Dust..

156
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,040
Oh, no..

157
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,560
Hello, Ravi!

158
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,480
Yes.
Tell me.

159
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,600
Where are Vidya and Tia?

160
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
They must be with you, right?

161
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,720
No, they aren't with me.

162
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,400
She was talking to
me over the phone.

163
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,960
There was a loud noise.

164
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,840
And then I don't know
what happened.

165
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
I've been trying to call her.

166
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,200
Well..

167
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,280
They will come back.
Don't worry.

168
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,440
What do you mean?

169
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,440
What..

170
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,360
Move..
Stay back.

171
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,080
Come on..

172
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,960
Stay back..
- Move..

173
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,760
Move..

174
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,720
Stay back!

175
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,960
Hey!

176
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,720
Go back..

177
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,720
All of you must
stay behind the rope.

178
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,520
No..

179
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,280
Move..
- Move back..

180
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,480
I had called you up long back!
You have come now.

181
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,360
What are you doing?
- Stay back.

182
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,000
Good morning, sir. - Move back.
- Good morning.

183
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,120
Come here..

184
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,320
Akhil!
- Yes, sir.

185
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,320
Good to see you.

186
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,160
The last we met was
during the training.

187
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,640
Yes, sir.
- Very good. How are you?

188
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,160
Where are you posted?
- I am fine, sir.

189
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,720
I have been posted
in your police station.

190
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,600
I waited for you the whole day.
I thought of meeting you.

191
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,360
But I learnt that you had
gone to raid a place.

192
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,040
Yes.
We had gone to raid

193
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,360
but we got in trouble instead.

194
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,000
What happened here?

195
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,160
Sir, there are two dead bodies.

196
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,240
Okay.
- Here's the child

197
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,800
and a woman is lying over there.

198
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,800
This..

199
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,440
Move back..

200
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,280
Their condition is terrible.
- Show me..

201
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,120
We've also recovered
a vehicle at a distance.

202
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,720
It belongs to them, it seems.

203
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,760
What is the case?

204
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,200
Sir, it looks like rape.

205
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,440
Give it to me.

206
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,440
This country will never improve.

207
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,560
Stay back. Come on.

208
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,720
Our ministers are talking
about shaping India

209
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,320
and we still get to see
rape cases.

210
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,880
Here. Is there any witness?

211
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Sir, there's no witness.

212
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,320
One of them had called up.

213
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,320
I see..
- Sir, she is alive.

214
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,600
What! - This woman
is alive. - Give me.

215
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,160
Excuse me.

216
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,040
Yes, sir?

217
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,960
Ravi..
- I am Ravi Chauhan.

218
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,440
Vidya Chauhan is my wife.

219
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,280
I had received a call..
- Yes, I had called you up.

220
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,480
Wait.
- What?

221
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,040
What happened?
- But.. Sir..

222
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,200
She met with an accident.

223
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,880
What!
- Accident?

224
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,920
Will we get the report
by tomorrow?

225
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,400
Yes.
We will get it by tomorrow.

226
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,240
Sir! Vidya's husband is here.

227
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,400
I am Ravi Chauhan.

228
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,680
I had received a call.
My wife, Vidya..

229
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
What.. What has happened
to her? - Well..

230
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,960
What has happened?

231
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,680
Please, meet the doctor.
Come on.

232
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,840
But what has happened to her?

233
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,080
Is it a serious problem?
- Please, come. Meet the doctor.

234
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,960
Please, tell us.

235
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
What has happened to her?

236
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,680
I am sorry about your daughter.

237
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,600
We are performing
the post-mortem of her body.

238
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,840
Your wife is very critical.

239
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,280
There are deep bruises,
bleeding, tear

240
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,080
and infection of
the private parts.

241
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,040
She will need a lot
of support from you.

242
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,480
What is your name?
- Ravi. Ravi Chauhan.

243
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,120
Where were you last night?

244
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,160
Actually,
I was working late night.

245
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,800
Excuse me.
- Just a second.

246
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Is your wife a housewife
or does she work?

247
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,960
She is a teacher
in G.T. Memorial School.

248
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,800
She had gone out
with her daughter.

249
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,760
Do you know about it?

250
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,160
To her school.

251
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,320
They had an annual day function
at her school. - Yes.

252
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,400
She had gone there.

253
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,160
Does she often go out
of the house?

254
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,920
I didn't get you.

255
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,360
I mean, would she go out..

256
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,520
I want to say

257
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,800
that the incident happened

258
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
while she was talking to me
over the phone.

259
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
We will record your statement.
- Yes..

260
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,880
Who are you?

261
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,840
I am her friend.

262
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,720
You are not her relative.

263
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,040
I am talking to her relative.
Hold on.

264
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,280
Do you have enmity
with anyone?

265
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,440
No.

266
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,560
Do you doubt someone?

267
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,600
We'll find the culprit.

268
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,520
Anyway,
sorry for your daughter.

269
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,080
Here. Have it.

270
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,000
Where are you going?

271
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,080
I am feeling hot.

272
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,440
As if you are the only one!

273
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,680
Where are the chips?
- Here.

274
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,480
Sofiyan, good morning!
- What happened?

275
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,600
Which is the news channel?

276
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,200
I don't know. Find out.

277
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,400
'Delhi is terrified again'

278
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,960
'by the scream of a woman.'
- Tell me.

279
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,480
'After raping both mother
and daughter'

280
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,480
'the rapists mercilessly killed
the child.'

281
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
It's in the news!

282
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,080
The news of the rape
of the school teacher

283
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,000
is being aired.

284
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,480
What happened?

285
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,640
Is she the same woman?

286
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,880
Hey!

287
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,520
Is she still alive?

288
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,360
She will recognise all of us.

289
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,680
The police will arrest us.

290
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,040
I..

291
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,280
I don't want to go to jail.

292
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,880
His father will protect him.

293
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,760
What will we do?

294
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,440
Who had gone to throw her?
- Inder.

295
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,760
So what? I did go.

296
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,280
I was..
- He was puking.

297
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,560
It's natural.
People puke after getting drunk.

298
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,400
Sorry.

299
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,480
She's alive.
- You just want to eat!

300
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,080
I had told him!
- Hey!

301
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,280
This..
- Just three..

302
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,920
She is alive!

303
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,360
Keep quiet.
Don't get nervous.

304
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,280
Come over here. Sit down.
- Give me!

305
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,360
Hold the glass with care.
- Did you go?

306
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,320
Drink this.
- She is not dead.

307
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,600
She is still alive.

308
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,080
So what?
- What's the problem?

309
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Will you stop crying?

310
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,000
Just shut up.

311
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,080
We rule over this city.

312
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,000
Calm down.

313
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,720
Why are you stamping my feet?

314
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,120
Your father will save us,
right?

315
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,160
Yes, he will save us.
Don't worry.

316
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,880
His father will save us.

317
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,800
Nothing will happen.

318
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,760
Have a smoke.
- Don't worry. - Appu!

319
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,080
Say something, Appu!

320
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,920
I don't think..
- Would you just shut up?

321
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,200
Appu!

322
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,200
Apurva!

323
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,160
My name is Apurva!

324
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,640
Who knows you?

325
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,640
People do know me.

326
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,960
If anything happens
because of all of you..

327
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,600
Then we'll deal with it.

328
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,520
She is not dead.
- Shut up!

329
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,760
What if she gives
her statement?

330
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,720
Quiet!
Just keep quiet.

331
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,360
She will..
- Quiet!

332
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,840
Why did Vidya have to
take that exit?

333
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,920
Why did she take that turn?

334
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,760
Darn it!

335
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,400
We wouldn't have got
into this situation.

336
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,200
Seriously!

337
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,200
Ravi!

338
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,000
Didn't you have any other
question to ask?

339
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,480
She shouldn't have
taken that turn.

340
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,600
She shouldn't have
taken that turn.

341
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,480
So, you are implying
that it's her fault!

342
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,560
I am not implying anything.

343
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,400
I am just saying

344
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,000
that if Vidya hadn't
taken that turn

345
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,440
Tia would have been alive.

346
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,920
She would have been with us.

347
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,160
Seriously, Ravi?

348
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,120
Seriously?

349
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
Your wife has been raped.

350
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,400
And you think it's..
You are the victim!

351
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,320
Think about Vidya.

352
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,760
Did Vidya think twice
before taking that turn?

353
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,600
Did she?

354
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,800
Excuse me, Mr. Ravi.

355
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,840
Yes. Ravi Chauhan.

356
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,320
My wife?

357
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,920
Sir, we've done the post-mortem
of your daughter.

358
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,240
Was Tia..

359
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Yes.

360
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,760
She had been raped.
It's confirmed.

361
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,520
In fact, gang rape.

362
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,480
You can go to the billing
department and talk to them.

363
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,520
They will assist you.
- Oh, God!

364
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,400
'Ravi, you are disgusting.'

365
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,480
'You couldn't wait to
perform Tia's last rites.'

366
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,320
'Is Vidya nothing to you?'

367
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,320
'Tell me.
You only think about yourself.'

368
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,000
'What do you think?'

369
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,520
'Was Tia your daughter alone?'

370
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,800
It can be very painful for her

371
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,400
to say full sentences
at this time.

372
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,520
So, please,
try to be quick and easy.

373
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,920
Mr. Chauhan.

374
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,560
Is she better now?

375
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,880
Hello, ma'am.

376
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,160
I am Jayant Shroff.

377
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,160
Investigation officer.

378
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,400
Will you be able to talk a bit?

379
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,160
Yes.

380
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,000
I need to ask you
a few questions.

381
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,640
Ma'am, you are in pain.
But..

382
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,320
I won't take much of your time.

383
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,920
Are you noting it down?
- Yes.

384
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,280
Ma'am,
at what time did this happen

385
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,240
day before yesterday?

386
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,640
Ma'am.

387
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,480
Tell me.

388
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,240
At 10 p.m.
- 10 p.m.?

389
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,840
Around 10:30 p.m.

390
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,600
Who was with you?

391
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,560
Can you hear me?

392
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,680
Who was with you?

393
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,040
Tia!

394
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,880
How is Tia?
Where is Tia?

395
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,080
Ma'am, Tia is no more.

396
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,600
She died.

397
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,200
So sorry for that.

398
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,600
Tia!

399
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,440
Tia!

400
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,280
Tia!

401
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,120
Tia!

402
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,680
Tia!

403
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Ravi!

404
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,160
Tia..

405
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,520
Ma'am,
just a couple of questions more.

406
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,840
How many of them were they?

407
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,520
Five?

408
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,440
Seven?

409
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,560
They were seven.

410
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,360
Do you know any of them?

411
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,840
Have you seen them before?

412
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,880
His..

413
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,120
His son.

414
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,080
His son.

415
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,720
His son.

416
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,840
We'll talk later.

417
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,880
She should rest now.

418
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,200
Okay.
- Let's go.

419
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,200
You come with us for a second.

420
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,520
'They are ready to help 24/7.'

421
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,040
'We have launched
women helpline.'

422
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,160
Hello!

423
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,280
Yes, Shroff. Tell me.

424
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,080
What!

425
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,640
Are you sure?

426
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
It's confirmed, sir.

427
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,680
Mr. Patil!

428
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,880
What!

429
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,120
She is taking Apurva's name!

430
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,480
Dad, don't bother me.
- Really?

431
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,000
I am bothering you!

432
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,680
Now, the commissioner will
ask for a huge amount.

433
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,600
What about that?

434
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,240
You can give it
from the party fund.

435
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,640
You don't have to give it
from your pocket.

436
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,080
I know your game, Dad.

437
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,240
'CM involved in black money scandal.'

438
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,440
'Police has assured that
the criminals won't be spared.'

439
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,560
Come on, let's go home.

440
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
We have got the discharge card.

441
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,560
The car is parked outside.

442
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,520
And the driver is also ready.

443
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,920
Shall we go?
- Ravi hasn't come yet.

444
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,040
He doesn't have time.

445
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,360
The way he spoke to me..

446
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,120
I am telling you..

447
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,880
I was quiet because of you.

448
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,760
Otherwise,
I would have snatched his eyes!

449
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
I mean, come on.

450
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,240
He is behaving as
if he is the victim.

451
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,120
Why did you marry him?

452
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,240
The way he performed
Tia's last rites..

453
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,000
I just felt as if

454
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,080
he just wanted to get it over
and done with.

455
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,040
What kind..
What kind of a man is he?

456
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,160
Come on, Vidya. Come on.

457
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,960
You have always been stronger
and stable than me.

458
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,680
What did I have? Nothing.

459
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,480
I only had dad's money.

460
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,400
If I was in your place..

461
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,840
I swear,
I would have killed them.

462
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,200
I mean..

463
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,400
What the heck!

464
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,800
Is this a fight for justice?

465
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,240
Yes, hello!

466
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,720
I have to go.

467
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,680
Okay, fine. I am coming.

468
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,600
Let me know if you
need anything, okay?

469
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,920
Okay?

470
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,240
Come on, give me a hug.

471
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,760
I have discussed
with the secretary.

472
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
It should be done by tomorrow.

473
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,640
Let's see what happens.

474
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,440
Hey!

475
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,320
What happened?

476
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,480
No..

477
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,080
Are you okay?
- No..

478
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,320
No, I can't.
- What?

479
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,920
What do you mean, you can't?

480
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,680
Yes.
- Just relax, okay?

481
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,680
Just relax.

482
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,000
Just calm down.
- Yes.

483
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,880
Calm down. Breathe.

484
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,320
Breathe.

485
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,240
Calm down.

486
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,240
Okay?
- Yeah.

487
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
Calm down.

488
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,480
You sit down.
I'll be right back.

489
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,120
Inspector Shroff!

490
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,560
He has gone on rounds.
He will be back soon.

491
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,760
Thank you.

492
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,640
We have to wait.

493
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,920
'Jai Hind', sir.

494
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,600
'Jai Hind', sir.
- 'Jai Hind', sir.

495
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,880
Ma'am, you!
Please, be seated.

496
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,000
Please, sit down.

497
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,040
Why did you bother?

498
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,280
You should have taken rest.

499
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,960
Please, be seated.

500
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,640
Excuse me!

501
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,600
Just a second.

502
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,240
I'll just come.
Okay?

503
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,600
Ma'am, take a seat.

504
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,280
What brings you here?

505
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,160
Ravi told me

506
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,120
that you wanted to meet.

507
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,360
But I wanted to meet him,
not her.

508
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,400
Don't you want
to talk to Vidya in detail?

509
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,760
No.
We have already talked.

510
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,600
We have arrested
three of them

511
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,080
and they have confessed
their crime.

512
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,200
But..

513
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,040
I was thinking that you were
waiting for Vidya to recover.

514
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,280
Whom did you catch?

515
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,960
Akhil!

516
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,320
Show her the photographs
of all the three boys.

517
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,160
Sir.

518
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,280
They..
Who are these people?

519
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,000
Inspector Shroff, who are..

520
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,320
Who are these people?

521
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,280
Ma'am,
they are unemployed youth.

522
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,280
They were into robbery.

523
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,880
It's better you take her
away from here.

524
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,360
It's not right for her
to be here in this condition.

525
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,760
First of all, I didn't
bring her here willingly.

526
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,200
I had been told

527
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,080
that you were willing
to meet her.

528
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,080
That's why, I got her here.

529
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:38,960
And..

530
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
Who are these three people?

531
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,400
Let me remind you

532
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,680
that Vidya had spoken about
the CM's son and his friends.

533
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,920
You want to shut the case,
don't you?

534
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,720
What are you getting in return?

535
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,360
Money?

536
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,360
Promotion?

537
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,160
Or are you trying
to save your job?

538
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,120
Do you know what
has happened here?

539
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,960
Inspector Shroff,
a mother and a daughter

540
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,520
have been gang raped.

541
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,640
And the child was murdered
before her mother.

542
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,800
Do you even know what that
mother is going through?

543
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,000
Do you even understand?

544
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,880
And what the heck
are you guys doing here?

545
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,560
Have you registered an FIR?

546
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,680
Please,
show me the copy of the FIR.

547
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,080
Just a second, ma'am.
Hold on.

548
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,440
First of all,
don't try to threaten us.

549
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,240
I am not trying to threaten you.

550
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,800
I want to see the copy
of the FIR. - Yes..

551
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,320
You will get the copy.
Akhil, get the copy.

552
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,400
Okay, sir.

553
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,280
It's unbelievable.

554
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,880
It's wrong if we catch someone

555
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,720
and even when we don't.

556
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,720
I haven't come here
to prove anyone right or wrong.

557
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,360
I just want to know one thing,
Inspector Shroff.

558
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Will Vidya and Tia get
justice or not?

559
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,520
What did you say?

560
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,400
Justice?

561
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,480
Ma'am,
this world looks good in films.

562
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,880
It's not something

563
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,440
that you order
and you get it instantly.

564
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,040
Ma'am, more than 3 crores
cases are pending

565
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,320
in the Indian court.

566
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,440
And you want justice instantly.

567
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,960
Unbelievable!

568
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,360
By the way, what will you do?

569
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,320
Would you lead a candle march?

570
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,280
Would you post it on
social networking sites?

571
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,960
Is this how you
will get justice?

572
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,680
You need justice!

573
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,800
Ma'am, what is it that we have?
Think about it.

574
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,760
Do we have witnesses
and evidence?

575
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,720
We have nothing.

576
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,920
Vidya is the witness.

577
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,880
Ma'am, she is the victim.

578
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,880
Her testimony is not enough.

579
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,040
Please, try to understand.

580
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,480
And the people she is blaming..

581
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,360
They can create and destroy
witnesses overnight.

582
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,680
I understand.

583
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,640
I get your point.
- Ma'am, just..

584
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,160
Just listen to me once.

585
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,400
I don't want her
to go through all this again.

586
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,160
They are not going
to get affected.

587
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,440
People like Vidya
will get affected.

588
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,000
First, they get humiliated
by those culprits.

589
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,400
Then by the media

590
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,800
and by the lawyers in the court.

591
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,560
Ma'am, it's not at all difficult
for them to prove

592
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,800
that Vidya had willingly taken
her daughter to the farm house.

593
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,560
I hope you are getting me.

594
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,640
Yes.

595
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,640
Loud and clear.

596
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,800
Here's the copy of your FIR.

597
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,520
Thank you very much.

598
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Hey! Excuse me. A woman was
sitting here. Where did she go?

599
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:43,760
"All the expectations
and requests are ineffective."

600
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,040
"I have no will"

601
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,800
"or anyone who can
sympathise with me."

602
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,040
"I have the support of no one."

603
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,640
"Who should I tell"

604
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:09,000
"about my helplessness?"

605
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:19,280
"Life.. Oh, life!"

606
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,920
"Life.. Oh, life!"

607
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,480
"Life.. Oh, life!"

608
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,480
"Life.. Oh, life!"

609
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:59,840
"I wonder what game"

610
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,440
"my fate has played."

611
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:16,800
"All my lullabies"

612
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:23,400
"have become my mourning."

613
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,040
"Why did all my dreams"

614
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,960
"get wiped off"

615
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:39,200
"along with my tears?"

616
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,840
"All my desires"

617
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,360
"are burnt along"

618
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,440
"with my heart."

619
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,560
"How can anyone tolerate"

620
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,400
"such injustice?"

621
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,880
Vidya, we need to talk.

622
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,800
I don't think
we'll be able to live together.

623
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,840
Whenever I look at you..

624
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,720
You remind me of that night.

625
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,680
I am reminded of the turn

626
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,720
which you shouldn't have taken.

627
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,720
And Tia's face appears
before me.

628
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:50,080
Anyway, our marriage was intact
because of Tia.

629
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,080
Neither do we have..

630
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,040
Neither do we have Tia

631
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,360
nor do I have patience.

632
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,560
We staying together..

633
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,080
It's just not possible.

634
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,880
Can you pass me the ketchup,
please?

635
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:30,720
"Life.. Oh, life!"

636
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:38,760
"Life.. Oh, life!"

637
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,360
"Life.. Oh, life!"
- Ritu!

638
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,560
"All the scenes have vanished."

639
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:19,800
"The stars and moon
have hid themselves."

640
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:28,280
"The disaster was
sudden and destructive."

641
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:34,920
"All the shores have
disappeared."

642
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,120
"All the footprints"

643
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,400
"have been erased"

644
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:51,600
"from the way."

645
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,640
"My companion got lost"

646
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:08,000
"as if I lost everything."

647
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,520
"The destiny is unknown"

648
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,320
"even the companions
are strangers."

649
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,520
Sir.

650
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,920
Sikander Beniwal.

651
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,360
He is around 29 years old.

652
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,760
The addressed mentioned
is of Chandigarh. - Okay.

653
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,680
And the registration
of the bike

654
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,960
is made under Apurva Malik.

655
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,400
It has Delhi's registration.

656
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,200
Apurva Malik!

657
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,280
How did the wheel get
dismantled?

658
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,040
Oh, God!

659
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,240
I am just not a morning person.

660
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,400
Why do we have to wake up
in the morning?

661
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,320
Look at you.

662
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,760
Always fresh in the morning.

663
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,200
You have become
tech savvy these days.

664
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,360
What do you do
on the laptop all the time?

665
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,360
I have to set the exam papers.

666
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,160
I see.

667
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,200
Really?

668
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,440
Wow!

669
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,920
You must construct a similar
house for yourself.

670
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,200
Come on, sir.

671
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,080
You are very funny.
It's not so easy.

672
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,720
He is the CM's son.

673
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,400
Sir!

674
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,680
Where have you brought him?

675
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,480
What brings you here?

676
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,960
Hey!

677
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,240
Dad does charity.

678
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,400
Why have you come here?

679
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,320
Is this your bike?

680
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,560
We have bikes,
planes and everything.

681
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,240
The registration
is done under your name.

682
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,320
So what?

683
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,560
What's the problem?

684
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,280
Do you know Sikander Beniwal?

685
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,920
He is my friend.

686
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,560
He roams around on this bike.

687
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,160
What happened?
Did he kill anyone?

688
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,560
He died last night.

689
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,840
Raja Ram Mohan Roy.

690
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,040
He was one of the greatest
social reformers

691
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,960
of this country during
the 1800s

692
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,960
including,
along with Swami Dayanand

693
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,000
Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar.

694
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,600
But Raja Ram Mohan Roy..

695
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,320
He advocated for the liberty

696
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,560
and upliftment of women.

697
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,320
He single-handedly

698
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,120
helped abolish the 'Sati'.

699
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,840
'Sati' was a practice
that was followed blindly

700
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,680
by the people of our country.

701
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,640
The different groups as in..

702
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,040
We have a caste system and..

703
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,440
I think, that's all for today.

704
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,960
See you all in the next class,
children.

705
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,840
Meenal!
- Yes, ma'am.

706
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,960
How are you, dear?

707
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,800
Ma'am, I am fine.
How are you?

708
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,480
I had been noticing that you
were a bit lost in thoughts.

709
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,960
Ma'am, there's nothing
as such.

710
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,040
Is everything all right?

711
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,480
Yes, ma'am.

712
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,760
Actually, I need your help.

713
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,080
Ma'am,
we can upload a few pictures

714
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,480
from Tia's account everyday

715
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,040
or every third day.

716
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,760
We can also tag people in it.

717
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,480
This will help us
get more likes.

718
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,160
And people will be able
to repost it.

719
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,240
For example..

720
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,760
For example, this picture.

721
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,600
And I am tagging
all my friends in this picture.

722
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,080
Don't..

723
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,200
Don't post it now.

724
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,360
By the way, Tia and you have

725
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,280
many mutual friends.

726
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,400
Yes.

727
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,280
Ma'am, I am getting late.
- Why?

728
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,200
What happened, Meenal?

729
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,080
Nothing, ma'am.

730
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,360
Meenal!

731
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,600
What's the matter?

732
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,200
Look, you can share with me.

733
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,200
You can tell me.
Have trust in me.

734
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,320
Meenal!

735
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,560
Meenal!

736
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,480
It's okay.

737
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,640
What happened, dear?

738
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,320
What's the matter, Meenal?

739
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,200
Inder Jhangra.

740
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,920
Inder Jhangra is our neighbour.

741
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,000
'How dare you..'

742
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,000
'It's been two hours.'

743
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,320
'You haven't served
my breakfast yet.'

744
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,800
My parents used
to argue everyday

745
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,040
because my father wasn't
doing good in business.

746
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,400
He started drinking.

747
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,080
I used to always
lock myself in a room.

748
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,600
One day,
Inder rang the door bell

749
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,800
after hearing the noise.

750
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,160
'She beats me up.'

751
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,960
My dad tried to stop him
but in vain. - 'Hello, ma'am.'

752
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,400
He started visiting us often.

753
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,880
I used to be in school.

754
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,520
'This is my favourite channel.
- I see.'

755
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,800
Inder used to make
my father drink

756
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,080
and with mom, he would..

757
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,040
One day,
I came back home a little early.

758
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,240
He..

759
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,000
He started taking me to hotels.

760
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,880
From the past six months..

761
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,280
He told me to come
along with him

762
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,600
on our annual day.

763
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,760
But I made an excuse

764
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,120
saying that I am going back home
with Tia and you.

765
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,800
And I heard the news.

766
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,800
That means, you knew it..

767
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,720
Ma'am, they are dirty people.

768
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,080
They roam around with guns.

769
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,440
They take drugs.

770
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,440
And they threatened me

771
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,200
that if I tell this to anyone,
they will..

772
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,600
Meenal, nothing will happen.

773
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,280
Don't worry, okay?

774
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,640
I won't let anything
happen to you.

775
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,880
I promise you.

776
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,200
Sir!
- Yes.

777
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,280
Sir, as you had said..

778
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,440
I didn't find anything fishy
in the call records

779
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,440
of all the mobile phones
that were active in that area.

780
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,120
Look,
this looks like a bike accident.

781
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,320
But dismantling of the wheel..

782
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,280
It's not possible
in such bike accidents.

783
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,680
Sir, it looks like an accident.

784
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,960
Yes,
it looks like an accident but..

785
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,200
The question is.. Who has been
benefited by his death?

786
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,320
Ma'am!

787
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,040
Ma'am,
he has called me this evening.

788
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:32,960
Don't worry.

789
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,280
I'm fine. How are you?

790
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,880
Great.
- Great! Please.

791
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,480
Yes, Harshit. Tell me.

792
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:58,840
Where are you?

793
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,560
I'm on my way. There's a traffic
jam. It might take some time.

794
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,520
I got a call from
the restaurant.

795
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,720
So,
I won't be able to stay here.

796
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,360
Your wish.
- You know the room number.

797
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,880
Drop in if you want
to have some fun.

798
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:12,920
Okay.

799
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,760
Good evening, ma'am.

800
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,600
Show.. - Excuse me, I have
a call to attend. - Sure..

801
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,120
I think you should have a look.

802
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,000
Have a look..

803
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,000
How are you doing?
- I'm doing well, sir.

804
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:20,880
Good?

805
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,440
Here I am.

806
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,200
Hello!
- Hello..

807
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,880
It's so nice to meet you.
- Same here.

808
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,720
Are you liking it?

809
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,360
This is one of my favourite
painting.

810
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,000
Ma'am..

811
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,600
Ma'am!

812
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,520
Ma'am!

813
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,200
Ma'am..
- It's okay.

814
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,280
I don't want to do this.

815
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:19,960
It's okay.

816
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,560
Your name?

817
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:58,600
Tell us your name.
- Meenal Shrivastav.

818
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,520
What do you do?

819
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,880
I am a student

820
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,440
at G T Memorial School.

821
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,520
Give me your phone.

822
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,800
Why are you here?

823
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,040
Inder asked me to meet him here.

824
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,000
Does this phone have a password?

825
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,880
What were you doing here?

826
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,840
Actually, sir..

827
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,000
Sir, I'm sure it's a case
of drug overdose.

828
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,800
It looks like a case
of drug overdose but..

829
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,400
It is not.

830
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,480
Sir, the girl is a minor.

831
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,080
We can go to her school
and enquire about her.

832
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,120
G T Memorial School.

833
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,480
Did you call the forensic
laboratory?

834
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,160
Yes, sir.

835
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,720
Do one thing,
call Apurva and ask him

836
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,480
if he knew somebody
by the name Inder.

837
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,280
Find out.
- Yes, sir.

838
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:17,800
Hello?

839
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,280
Hello?

840
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,800
Mrs. Chauhan.

841
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:28,960
Hello.

842
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,560
Is this your number?
- Yes.

843
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:33,960
This is my number.

844
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,400
How come you are here?

845
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,520
Why? Is it forbidden
for me to come here?

846
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,960
No.. How do you know this girl?

847
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,320
She's my student.

848
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,440
But where did you find
her phone?

849
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,480
Where is Meenal?

850
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,400
When was the last time
she spoke to you?

851
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,200
Just a few minutes ago.

852
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,800
Why are you asking me all this?

853
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,680
This is Meenal's..
- Mrs. Chauhan.

854
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,400
What's happening?

855
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,680
What are you trying to ask me?

856
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,320
Nothing.
- Vidya..

857
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,800
I've been calling you
all this while.

858
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,800
Why didn't you answer?

859
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,560
What is he doing here?

860
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,920
Is he here to give you
a copy of the FIR?

861
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,320
No.

862
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,040
Maybe he's on duty.

863
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,680
Let's go.

864
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:22,880
Come on.

865
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,080
Sir, I spoke to Apurva.
- What?

866
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,200
We're going through
a bad phase.

867
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,480
Two of our mates passed away.

868
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,080
Could it be her?

869
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,200
Who?
- The teacher.

870
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,400
Which teacher?

871
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,760
You remember that night,
that teacher and her daughter..

872
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,040
What about her?

873
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,920
That day,
she was present there.

874
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,080
I saw her outside the hotel.

875
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,160
I think she's behind all this.

876
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:54,960
Can a woman do all this?

877
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,320
I don't think so.

878
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,000
Anything is possible.
You remember? I told you..

879
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,800
Make sure you be careful
while disposing her.

880
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,520
You always take
things for granted.

881
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,080
Apurva, what if she's
the one doing all this?

882
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,680
We can't go to the police..
- I don't think it's her.

883
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,400
First and foremost,
she has no courage.

884
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:15,440
Uncle,
get some information about her.

885
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,880
Find out what she is up to.

886
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,680
Where are you going?

887
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,120
Hey!
- Hit him!

888
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,240
Hit him..

889
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,120
Take this..
- Come on..

890
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,520
Hit him!
Where will you go?

891
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,200
Look here and talk to him.

892
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,320
'You don't know me.'

893
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:09,280
'But your wife knows me
very well.'

894
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,560
Sir, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

895
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,640
A-And I have nothing to do
with my wife.

896
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,400
'If you don't control her'

897
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,240
'your condition
will be much worse.'

898
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,920
Trust me,
I'm not with her anymore.

899
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,120
Do you understand?
Keep it in mind.

900
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,840
Next time, we won't spare you.

901
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,360
'Vidya, just stop
whatever you're doing.'

902
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,520
'Just stop it!'

903
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:13,880
'Please, stop!'

904
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,400
'Two people came to my office
and beat me black and blue.'

905
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,080
'You killed my daughter.'

906
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,560
'And now you want to kill me!'

907
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,840
'Just get lost!'

908
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,280
'I have nothing to do with you.'

909
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,680
'I'm done with you.'

910
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:26,080
'Did you hear what I said?'

911
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,320
Oh, my God, Vidya.
The promoters have benefited

912
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,680
a lot from my exhibition.

913
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,560
They want to organise
another exhibition with me

914
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,480
in Mumbai.

915
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,760
We'll be going to Mumbai,
my dear.

916
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,640
I'm so proud of you.

917
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,480
You're only proud of me?

918
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,080
We'll have to celebrate
this occasion.

919
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,440
I'm not in mood.
- Why not?

920
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,480
We'll just go eat something
and come back.

921
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,720
I know a very nice restaurant.

922
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,840
Good evening, ma'am.
- Hi! - Good evening.

923
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,080
Table for two?
- Yes, ma'am. This way.

924
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,320
Downstairs? Come.

925
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,200
You know,
this is my favourite place.

926
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:26,080
I was supposed to come here
and celebrate with Tia.

927
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:34,880
I'm sorry.

928
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,640
I always feel Tia's presence
amongst us.

929
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,960
She's still around.

930
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,960
I know. It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

931
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,400
I need to use the washroom.

932
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:48,680
Okay.

933
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,840
I'll be right back.

934
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,880
Hey! You always call
me when I'm busy.

935
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,640
We don't have to search
for that teacher anymore.

936
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,720
What do you mean?

937
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,440
She's sitting right here
in my restaurant.

938
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,960
Wow! That's great news.
You're a true friend.

939
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,880
What do you say?
Shall I kill her?

940
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,880
First of all,
shut down all your CCTV cameras.

941
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,280
Take her into your custody.

942
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,480
He's so cool. - I couldn't
stop looking at him.

943
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,640
Oh, God. - I'll be right back.
Okay? - Okay.

944
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,160
Hello! Yes, Apurva.

945
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,200
Rajvi, I'm leaving, okay?

946
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,080
Come on!
- Give me your phone!

947
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,160
Give me your phone!

948
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:55,800
Hello, Vidya.

949
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,400
Ritu, I'll meet you at home.

950
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,240
I'm okay. Don't worry.

951
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,600
Come on. Move!

952
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,680
Oh, God. What's going on?

953
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,560
Please drive away from here.

954
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,640
Please drive faster. - Stop!
- Please.. - Stop!

955
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,160
Didn't I ask you to stop?
- Are you mad?

956
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,280
Get out of the car..
- Have you lost it? - Get out!

957
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,400
Get out.
I'm telling you, get out!

958
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,960
Shut up.. Out! Get out!

959
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,160
Get out..

960
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,120
Vidya! What happened?

961
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,280
Thank God you're safe.

962
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:21,800
I was so worried.

963
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,560
What happened?
I heard it was a murder.

964
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,240
What's the matter, Vidya?

965
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:42,560
Ritu!

966
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,480
Actually..

967
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,480
I think I need to tell
you the truth.

968
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,400
Forward the video.

969
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,600
Rewind it a bit.

970
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,120
A little more.
That's enough.

971
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,280
Zoom in.

972
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:07,560
Vidya Chauhan!

973
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,160
What is she doing here, sir?

974
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:12,680
Hide and seek..

975
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,360
Sorry?

976
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,600
Hide and seek.

977
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,720
Sir, we have found two dead
bodies close to this place.

978
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,760
Who is it? - This
is Inspector Shroff speaking.

979
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,320
I wanted to ask you something.

980
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:46,400
What's the matter?

981
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,920
Just like Sikander Beniwal
and Inder Jhangra

982
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,320
do you also know Harshit
Poojary and Kamran Qureshi?

983
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:54,960
Why? What's the matter?

984
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,080
They've been murdered.

985
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,000
Hello!

986
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:01,960
Hello!

987
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,600
Hello!

988
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:07,720
Hello!

989
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,240
I don't know anything.
I'll call you back.

990
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,640
Look at this.

991
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,320
Uncle!

992
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,080
You are useless!

993
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,960
I wonder who this woman is!

994
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,120
That inspector is questioning me
and I can't tell him anything.

995
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,200
I told you so many times.

996
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,680
Check thoroughly
if they are dead or not.

997
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,480
At least we wouldn't
be in trouble.

998
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,720
Everybody wants to enjoy.
But nobody knows

999
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,640
how to do the work well.

1000
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,320
Should we sit and crib
over the spilt milk..

1001
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,320
Or should we think of how
to stop this school teacher?

1002
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,080
Uncle..

1003
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,280
Call my dad.

1004
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,320
What was the door number?

1005
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,400
It was F1, sir.

1006
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:15,800
This is the one.

1007
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,440
Here, sir.
- This one?

1008
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,480
Yes..
- Excuse me.

1009
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,280
Hello!
- Excuse me.

1010
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,000
Where were you this evening?

1011
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:33,600
What do you mean by that?

1012
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,640
Where were you this evening?

1013
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,200
This is strange.
It has become a pattern.

1014
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,120
Wherever you go,
we find people dead.

1015
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,000
Someone very influential
passed away?

1016
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,960
I'm not here to listen
to your taunts.

1017
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,760
Someone's dead.

1018
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,000
Someone had died
that night as well.

1019
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:56,760
Listen, Mrs. Chauhan.

1020
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,160
I understand what you're
going through.

1021
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,560
But what you're
doing isn't right.

1022
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,560
If you are not here to
listen to people's taunts

1023
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,960
we're not interested in
listening to people's lecture.

1024
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,640
Please, you may leave now.

1025
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:34,600
I'll pay you more!

1026
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,040
Just make sure
you do the work perfectly.

1027
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,000
Okay?

1028
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:15,920
Who the hell are you?

1029
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:40,440
"They are lost"

1030
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:44,080
"in the walk of life."

1031
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:48,560
"The human beings
that You created.."

1032
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:52,200
"Oh, God."

1033
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:56,560
"They have forgotten"

1034
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:00,320
"what humanity means."

1035
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:04,800
"The human beings
that You created.."

1036
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,520
"Oh, God."

1037
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:12,600
"Even after knowing everything"

1038
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,840
"they pretend to be unaware."

1039
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:21,240
"Only for namesake, they are.."

1040
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,200
"The human beings
that You created.."

1041
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:28,520
"They are getting worse"

1042
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:33,120
"day by day."

1043
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:37,080
"The human beings
that You created.."

1044
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,520
"Oh, God."

1045
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:48,320
"God, Almighty!
Show me Your mercy."

1046
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,880
"Stand by me."

1047
01:20:53,640 --> 01:21:00,800
"I request You to
listen to our cries."

1048
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,000
"Stand by me."

1049
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,280
"Oh, God.."

1050
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,680
"Oh, God.."

1051
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,200
"Stand by me."

1052
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,040
"Stand by me."

1053
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,920
"Oh, God.."

1054
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:25,360
"Oh, God.."

1055
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:29,280
"Stand by me."

1056
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:36,960
Uncle,
I have a meeting to attend

1057
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,160
and you're drinking and driving.

1058
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,120
Sofiyan.. - Keep your eyes on
the road. What are you doing?

1059
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,280
I'm driving.
- The meeting is very important.

1060
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,560
You ate chicken and you finished
the peanuts as well.

1061
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:48,920
That's okay. We'll see
to it later. - What are you..

1062
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,680
We've reached.
Look, I brought you here safely.

1063
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,840
Now, we'll have to answer
to his questions as well.

1064
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,680
You go finish your work
and come back

1065
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,040
and I'll wait for you here.

1066
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,080
How long will it take?

1067
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,720
I don't know how long
the client will take.

1068
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,680
Shouldn't take much time. I'll
come back as soon as possible.

1069
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:03,840
Please park the car
somewhere else and talk.

1070
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,880
There's no parking here.
- Okay.

1071
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,400
You are not allowed
to park here. - Okay, fine.

1072
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,160
You hurry up.
I'll wait here for you.

1073
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,960
We'll have to go to
Apurva's place after that.

1074
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,480
We've been going through
a lot of negativity these days.

1075
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:15,480
Come soon.
Let's do something different.

1076
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,920
I've been telling you,
there's no parking.. - Yes..

1077
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,880
Right? - What did I say? - I
shouldn't have had a meeting.

1078
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,600
That's okay. Come back soon.
I'll wait here for you.

1079
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,800
I'll be back.
- Move your car from here.

1080
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,720
Okay. Take care of yourself.
- Hurry up.

1081
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,680
Come on..
- Come back soon..

1082
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,400
What's your problem in life?

1083
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,240
Ms. Roshni Ahuja..

1084
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:54,720
You!

1085
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:56,960
I mean, what..

1086
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,120
What are you doing here?

1087
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,040
What brought you here?

1088
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,160
I have a meeting
with Ms. Roshni Ahuja.

1089
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,960
We were supposed to meet here.
What are you..

1090
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,080
Please leave.

1091
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,880
Are you here to kill me?

1092
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:13,680
You won't be able to escape.

1093
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,840
I'm telling you to move this car
of yours. You can drink later.

1094
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,200
Excuse me.

1095
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,240
Move your car from here.

1096
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,320
Hey! - Don't you understand
what I'm telling you?

1097
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,960
I'm moving it.
- Do it now.

1098
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,080
I'm not involved in yours
and your daughter's rape case.

1099
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,160
I was present there that night.
But I didn't do anything.

1100
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,960
Did I ask you anything?

1101
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:44,200
It's not too late.
We'll do one thing

1102
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,120
let's solve this.

1103
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,120
Those rascals! We should discuss
this. Let's discuss this.

1104
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,600
Can you bring back Tia?

1105
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,920
Trust me, I didn't do anything.

1106
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,520
I'm not like them.

1107
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,360
Please let me go.

1108
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,360
I'll do whatever
you want me to do.

1109
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,600
You can't do anything.

1110
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:18,520
I can.

1111
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:22,840
I-I..
I'll give you Apurva's address.

1112
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,160
Kill him however you wish to.

1113
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:25,440
I'll even help you with it.

1114
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:26,960
Give him a call.

1115
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:29,520
Tell him that you're
going to tell

1116
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,000
the police what he has done.

1117
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,440
He'll kill me.

1118
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,200
I'll call him..

1119
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,840
Tell me, what's the matter?

1120
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:51,880
Enough is enough,
I can't take it anymore.

1121
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,080
I don't want to die.

1122
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,080
What's the matter?

1123
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,000
To me, my life is very precious.

1124
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,760
I've decided..
- What have you decided?

1125
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,880
I'll go,
tell the police the truth.

1126
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,520
That night..

1127
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,840
Because of you all,
even I'm in trouble.

1128
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,680
Very good! You're showing
me your true colours.

1129
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,440
What will you do?
You'll go to the police?

1130
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:17,160
They couldn't do anything to me.
How will they save you?

1131
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:20,880
Apurva, I'm going.
- Yes, go ahead.

1132
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:23,520
Go to the police.

1133
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:25,720
Go right away..

1134
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,440
I did it.

1135
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,640
Are you deaf?
- You..

1136
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,840
To heck with your parking.
- What's your name?

1137
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:35,800
Move your car.

1138
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,200
What's your name?
- Move your car!

1139
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,240
I said, move your car.

1140
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,960
What's your name? - Why
do you want to know my name?

1141
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,720
Move your car..
- Do you know who I am?

1142
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,760
What do I have to do with that?

1143
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:15,000
'Go to the police.'

1144
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,160
'Go right away..'

1145
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,240
What's your problem?
Tell me your name.

1146
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,160
Why do you want my name?
- How dare you touch me!

1147
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,120
Why would I want to touch you?

1148
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:30,560
Just move your.. - Do you know
how influential I am?

1149
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,160
Move it.
Move it..

1150
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:39,720
Move your car!

1151
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:40,880
Come on.

1152
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,080
Move aside!

1153
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,520
Look what has happened..
- He died..

1154
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:12,600
Call..
- Call the police..

1155
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,120
Sir, yes..

1156
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:17,960
Yes, sir..

1157
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,200
I've made the arrangements
for the party.

1158
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,880
There'll be a grand
party on Holi.

1159
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,880
Yes, sir. He's having a meeting
with the workers.

1160
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,040
Just a moment, sir.

1161
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,880
The Home Minister has..

1162
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,160
I'll call you back, sir.

1163
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,920
Yes, sir.
- Are you sure

1164
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:42,160
that the same lady has killed
your friends and Sutti?

1165
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,520
Stop questioning me.
I told you what I have to.

1166
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,880
There's nobody else.
I told you!

1167
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,080
This is preposterous.

1168
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,960
How can a woman do all this?

1169
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,040
She's after all just a woman.

1170
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,520
Anyway..

1171
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,960
We'll see to it after Holi.

1172
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,760
Are you aware
of the grand celebration

1173
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,800
that our party has organised
on the occasion of Holi?

1174
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,880
Wow! Father. We lost uncle

1175
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,880
and you're bothered about
your celebrations. - Shut Up!

1176
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,160
Do you know what
all we need to do

1177
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,760
to gain the sympathy
of the public?

1178
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,200
Patel!
- Yes, sir.

1179
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:16,440
Ask the commissioner
to arrest her.

1180
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,520
I mean, to arrest that woman.

1181
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,920
Yes, sir..

1182
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:25,440
Okay, sir..

1183
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,240
I understand.

1184
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:49,840
Not here, sir.

1185
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,680
Down with..
- The Chief Minister..

1186
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:07,840
Down with..
- The Chief Minister..

1187
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:10,040
Down with..
- The Chief Minister..

1188
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,880
Down with..
- The Chief Minister..

1189
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,040
Down with..
- The Chief Minister..

1190
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,160
Down with..
- The Chief Minister..

1191
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,320
Down with..
- The Chief Minister..

1192
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,760
Down with..
- The Chief Minister..

1193
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,040
Down with..
- The Chief Minister..

1194
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,160
Security!
- Protect the minister!

1195
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:32,800
Get back!

1196
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:33,800
Please move..

1197
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,680
Step aside..

1198
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,760
Patel..
- Yes, sir.

1199
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,440
What kind of security is this?
- I'll see to it, sir.

1200
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:10,520
The people from
the opposition party

1201
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:14,880
enter my house and slap me and
I can't do anything about it.

1202
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:16,680
Get out!

1203
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:17,600
I said, get out!

1204
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,760
Leave..

1205
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:22,680
Switch on the TV.

1206
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:27,000
'Chief minister was slapped
in his Holi party.'

1207
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:28,440
I don't want this.

1208
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,520
Out!
Get out!

1209
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,480
'The celebration has turned
into a mourning.'

1210
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,880
Father, what's wrong with you?

1211
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,000
Why are you blaming Patel..
- Shut up!

1212
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,320
Why are you yelling at me..
- You just shut up!

1213
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,840
What is my media team doing?

1214
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,000
I want this news telecast
to stop at once.

1215
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,480
Shut it immediately.

1216
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:54,360
What are our
media channels doing?

1217
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:02,160
How dare you enter
a chief minister's house

1218
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,960
and point a gun at..

1219
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:07,800
How dare you!

1220
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,440
Give it to me..

1221
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:37,880
What happened, sir?

1222
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,880
I think, finally

1223
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:42,480
it is over.

1224
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:13,800
"She embraces me in her arms."

1225
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:19,560
"She embraces me in her arms."

1226
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:25,280
"Covering herself
with a veil of dignity."

1227
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:30,920
"She sleeps on a wet bed
even if it's winter."

1228
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:36,880
"She sleeps on a wet bed
even if it's winter."

1229
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:42,800
"She hardly gets to sleep
for a few hours in the morning."

1230
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:46,800
"This is how a mother is."

1231
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:51,360
"This is how a mother is."

1232
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:54,320
"This is how a mother is."

1233
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,120
"This is how a mother is."

1234
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:01,040
"This is how a mother is."

1235
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:28,760
"She calls for the angels
from heaven"

1236
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:34,480
"and asks them
to put you to sleep."

1237
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:40,320
"She shows you
the face of the moon."

1238
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:46,160
"This is how she decorates
the garland of motherhood."

1239
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:49,800
"This is how a mother is."

1240
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,600
"This is how a mother is."

1241
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:57,600
"This is how a mother is."

1242
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:00,400
"This is how a mother is."

1243
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:03,840
"This is how a mother is."

1244
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:31,840
"I will never let you suffer."

1245
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:37,760
"I will never let you
shed tears."

1246
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:43,440
"I will never let you cry
no matter the sorrow we face."

1247
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:49,240
"Your tears are precious
like pearls."

1248
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,120
"This is how a mother is."

1249
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:57,800
"This is how a mother is."

1250
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:00,840
"This is how a mother is."

1251
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:03,720
"This is how a mother is."

1252
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,720
"This is how a mother is."

1253
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:12,520
"This is how a mother is."

1254
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:18,760
"This is how a mother is."
