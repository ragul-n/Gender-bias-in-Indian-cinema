1
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:53,571
Oh no!

2
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,535
You're out of tune.
Completely out of tune.

3
00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:59,537
- What's up, Maestro? - A lifeless
voice can't sing in tune.

4
00:03:59,946 --> 00:04:01,914
Sounds like she has a sore throat.

5
00:04:02,682 --> 00:04:06,379
- What's wrong, Kiran?
- She needn't say. I know it all.

6
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:09,917
All these girls do nowadays
is to roam till late...

7
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:11,918
... at nights with friends.
She has shouted her voice hoarse.

8
00:04:12,258 --> 00:04:15,159
And they'll eat whatever they like.
ls that a sign of love for music?

9
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:19,556
- That's going to get you nowhere.
- Please do not say so, maestro.

10
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:23,862
Tell us Kiran, d'you or don't you
want to master classical music?

11
00:04:24,304 --> 00:04:27,569
You must devote yourself
completely to your lessons.

12
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:34,443
I'll be back after a few days.
Get over the sore throat by then.

13
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,811
Greetings, Sir.

14
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,552
- Does he have a problem with me?
- Never mind the daily dramatics.

15
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:46,983
Have you got the tickets
to the New Year's party?

16
00:11:38,738 --> 00:11:41,263
A pack of biscuits and a bread.
Need anything more?

17
00:11:41,707 --> 00:11:43,140
- No thanks. How much was that?
- Fifteen bucks.

18
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,309
Rohit Kumar, your neighbor upstairs,
screams his head off all day.

19
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:54,614
- Aren't your ears sore already?
- That's him rehearsing music.

20
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,650
And he loves music. Besides,
l am not irked to complain.

21
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:01,357
For God's sake!

22
00:12:04,597 --> 00:12:07,065
How come you're so busy with your
accounts so early in the morning?

23
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:10,458
- Won't you sit down to a cuppa?
- Woe beside!

24
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:14,465
Rohit Kumar hasn't paid
me in 3 months now.

25
00:12:14,874 --> 00:12:16,671
He gets me to make him new
dresses every now and then.

26
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:19,001
But just doesn't bother
to pay for the stitching.

27
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:22,405
He owes me a large sum too.
But I just can't complain.

28
00:12:24,183 --> 00:12:27,118
Hey Kanhaiya! Come over
for a cup of tea.

29
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:30,012
Give it a rev.

30
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:37,089
It's all your fault.

31
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,058
You've given the house to a
tuppence worth of a singer on rent.

32
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:42,432
All you have for yourself
is a room in the backyard.

33
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:49,539
- Has he paid the rents yet? - He'll
pay up in due course. Fine fellow.

34
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:51,009
How are you, Rohit?

35
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:56,140
- Come over here, Qasim.
- ln a moment.

36
00:12:56,882 --> 00:12:58,247
- I'm ravenous.
- What can I get you?

37
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:03,088
-2 fried eggs, buttered toasts, jam,
a special cup of tea. - Coming up.

38
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:07,788
Hello, Mr. Jamshed.
How d'you do?

39
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:10,789
- Forget niceties. Talk cash. - Some
bills are due for a couple of months.

40
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,522
Today's the first of the month.
I'll settle everything by the 30th.

41
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,967
Very well... er... what
did you say? By the 30th?

42
00:13:17,937 --> 00:13:20,462
- Exactly. How many days between
the 30th and the first? - One day.

43
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:24,800
- There you are. - The number of
days between the 1st and the 30th...

44
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:27,545
- He's making a fool out of Jamshed.
- That's right.

45
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:31,249
Didn't you have a show last night?
How did it go?

46
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,816
- It was a riot! - Was it then?!
- The crowd went berserk as I sang.

47
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:39,688
And the girls were crazy about me.

48
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:44,995
There was this girl
who caught my eye.

49
00:13:45,598 --> 00:13:47,623
She has beautiful eyes
and a pretty face.

50
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:52,536
- Fabulous! What happened later?
- She left after the program ended.

51
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:58,509
If she comes into my life, I'll
write the best songs on earth.

52
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:03,211
Dream you may.
But everyone cannot become Elvis.

53
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:08,220
Shut up Moolchand. You're a grocer.
What d'you know about music?

54
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:13,956
Someday Rohit Kumar will make the
greatest singer in our country.

55
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:32,866
No one even bothers to listen.

56
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:42,748
Look... it's Mehra. He's counting
the proceeds of the show last night.

57
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:47,717
- He made 50 to 60,000 last night.
- And we don't get a penny of it.

58
00:14:53,866 --> 00:14:55,094
Happy New Year, Mr. Mehra.

59
00:14:57,203 --> 00:15:00,832
What's so special about a New Year?
Just another day and another night.

60
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:03,835
Oh yes. But it was a grand
show last night, wasn't it?

61
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:06,938
- Well, average, I'd say.
- Average, d'you say? - About that.

62
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:08,646
- There! Look at the pile you made
last night. - What are you up to?!

63
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:15,451
It's all because of me, Sir.
People come here to hear me sing.

64
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:18,719
- That's how you sake in the moolah.
- D'you take yourself for a star...

65
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:22,650
... just because I've put up
a couple of your portraits?

66
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:27,262
- You see, Sir. I am...
- You should be grateful to me!

67
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:31,796
Grateful for letting you sing
before such a large gathering!

68
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:36,638
Minstrels like you roam the
streets a dime-a-dozen.

69
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,375
And no one would even
care to give you tuppence.

70
00:15:38,711 --> 00:15:39,837
You ingrate!

71
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:50,782
How dare you misbehave! You come
here to sing. Not to chase girls!

72
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:53,091
I'm not chasing her, Sir.
l was just...

73
00:15:58,097 --> 00:16:02,397
- I'm responsible for the harangue.
- It's a part of my daily diet.

74
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:05,294
Now, what's it you were saying?

75
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:08,631
- I'd like to learn how to
sing from you. - From me?!

76
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:19,082
And, you wrote such a beautiful
song. I'm crazy about your song.

77
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:20,678
I can't think of anything else.

78
00:16:22,855 --> 00:16:28,691
I couldn't sleep last night after
your show. I kept humming the tune.

79
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:34,993
- Neither did I sleep after
the show last night. - Why?

80
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:38,932
It is a new tune that
kept me up all the night.

81
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,103
Would you like to hear it?

82
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,236
Such a beautiful song!

83
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:56,742
Songs like that are what I'd like
to sing. Not the classicals.

84
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:59,083
Please teach me how to
sing a song like that.

85
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:00,942
I'll work hard at it.

86
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:05,579
Why don't we get married, Kiran?

87
00:23:07,326 --> 00:23:08,258
What?!

88
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:16,056
I've never thought about it.

89
00:23:18,503 --> 00:23:22,803
- I've only think about one thing.
- What?

90
00:23:23,775 --> 00:23:31,375
Music and my career. I want to make
the greatest singer of the land.

91
00:23:34,219 --> 00:23:36,449
- That'll be difficult.
- Why?

92
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:39,282
Because that status has been booked
for me a long while ago.

93
00:23:43,428 --> 00:23:49,458
What could be better for both of us?

94
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:57,066
We travel towards same goals. And
we could reach our goal together.

95
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,808
Tell me.... will you marry me?

96
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:05,947
What brings you here?

97
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:11,749
- He's a famous singer. - I see.
So you are a singer, are you?

98
00:24:12,157 --> 00:24:15,092
Actually, I'm a composer.

99
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:18,658
I write the songs I sing.

100
00:24:19,164 --> 00:24:20,028
Classicals?

101
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:26,497
- Not classicals. I sing
lighter tunes. - How light?

102
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,235
- I don't think you understand.
- Please help me too.

103
00:24:31,543 --> 00:24:34,444
I sing songs that strike a chord
in the heart.

104
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:37,378
And where do you sing such songs?

105
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,378
- Presently, I sing at a hotel.
- At a hotel?

106
00:24:43,588 --> 00:24:47,547
One might as well sing at a hotel
as go around with a begging bowl.

107
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:51,826
As with wandering minstrels who
collect pence in tips if at all.

108
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:55,430
Enough. I have not come here
to discuss my careers.

109
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:56,697
So, what brings you here?

110
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,932
Excuse me, Kiran.

111
00:25:04,443 --> 00:25:07,207
Stop, Rohit!

112
00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:09,143
Listen to me.....

113
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:20,313
I didn't invite Rohit so you
might insult him.

114
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:26,191
D'you take me for a fool? A look at
him and I know why you invited him.

115
00:25:26,731 --> 00:25:30,394
Stop being foolish. Your marriage
has already been fixed.

116
00:25:30,902 --> 00:25:39,776
- I'm in love with Rohit.
- Do you hear what she says?

117
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,780
You must consider the consequences.
This is not done.

118
00:25:46,618 --> 00:25:50,782
The upbringing and education I've
given her all these years are a waste!

119
00:25:51,356 --> 00:25:53,449
If you think so highly about my
upbringing and my education,...

120
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:55,884
... you should respect
my decisions too.

121
00:25:56,461 --> 00:26:00,056
I have a feeling that he's a
cunning fellow. He's ensnaring you.

122
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:04,099
- You're still an innocent girl.
- I'm no innocent, mother.

123
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:07,096
And what does that make of you?

124
00:26:07,405 --> 00:26:11,273
I'm an artist. And, he's an artist
too. You can't gauge our sentiments.

125
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:17,748
Don't I understand? An artist
my foot! A Bremen-town musician!

126
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:20,043
A good for nothing vagabond! And she
wants to marry him!

127
00:26:20,318 --> 00:26:21,785
You'll get to know about
the realities in life in no time!

128
00:26:22,153 --> 00:26:25,748
Don't you come back crying later on.
Our doors will have closed for you.

129
00:26:29,594 --> 00:26:35,499
Just as well that you told me all
this. It'll help me take my decision.

130
00:26:36,568 --> 00:26:38,126
I'm going to marry Rohit.

131
00:27:56,781 --> 00:28:00,182
- I'll floor them at the audition
today. - May I accompany you?

132
00:28:00,585 --> 00:28:01,643
It'll take me 2 minutes
to get dressed.

133
00:28:03,688 --> 00:28:05,485
lsn't the plumber expected in today?

134
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:08,453
See you. Bye.

135
00:28:52,303 --> 00:28:54,703
How are you going to climb four
stories in the condition you are?

136
00:28:55,073 --> 00:28:57,303
But, this is your first recording.
And I wanted to be there with you.

137
00:28:57,642 --> 00:29:00,202
I'm not recording for a film. Its
just a jingle for an advertisement.

138
00:29:01,446 --> 00:29:03,380
When am I going to meet the right
people? When will I start working?

139
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:09,680
It's just a matter of a few more
months. What makes you so upright?

140
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:57,557
- Hello, Farida. Come in.
- What are you doing?

141
00:29:57,902 --> 00:29:58,926
Nothing much. Just cooking.

142
00:29:59,404 --> 00:30:02,805
- Like a cup of tea? - Why not?
- ls the tea brewed? - Yes.

143
00:30:04,075 --> 00:30:05,599
I haven't seen you
around in 4 or 5 days.

144
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:08,506
- Have you been keeping well?
- Absolutely.

145
00:30:11,082 --> 00:30:15,485
- What's the matter? You seem tense.
- Not at all. I'm perfectly fine.

146
00:30:17,422 --> 00:30:19,982
How are your music
rehearsals going on?

147
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:25,153
l hardly find time outside household
chores. How am I to rehearse?

148
00:30:26,965 --> 00:30:31,231
What of the career in music? Can you
immerse yourself so in the chores?

149
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,964
You must carve out some time
everyday for rehearsing.

150
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,373
Look at me... I must fetch Sonu
from school after I finish cooking.

151
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:43,738
I'll go and fetch Sonu... Yes. l
will. It doesn't really matter.

152
00:30:49,687 --> 00:30:52,087
Will you please draw a bath for me?
Make it fast. I've to attend a party.

153
00:30:52,557 --> 00:30:55,788
- What party? - Oh, there's
something I'd like you to know.

154
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,518
- I've dumped the job.
- Why?

155
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:04,296
l had enough of Mehra's abuses.
Besides, I want to move upwards.

156
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:10,100
- What's more, I met Gulbadan
Kumar today. - Gulbadan Kumar?!

157
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:13,773
Yes. He owns Prince Records. Its
really tough to get to meet him.

158
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:18,443
I walked into his office and sang
a few songs. He liked my voice.

159
00:31:19,184 --> 00:31:24,417
He invited me to the party this
evening. Looks like I've made it.

160
00:31:25,156 --> 00:31:28,353
- Just press these clothes for me,
will you? - I'm coming with you!

161
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,128
- What'll you do there? You'd get
bored. - No. I won't get bored.

162
00:31:31,963 --> 00:31:34,659
- What about Sonu?
- Farida can put him to sleep.

163
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,667
All right. You can come along.
Get dressed in some good clothes.

164
00:31:38,903 --> 00:31:40,837
Now. Take the clothes.
Press them quickly.

165
00:31:46,611 --> 00:31:49,546
Congratulations, Mr. Gulbadan Kumar.
Ever since your company was formed...

166
00:31:49,981 --> 00:31:54,418
-... music sales have grown manifold.
-It's the grace of The Divine Mother.

167
00:31:57,555 --> 00:32:01,082
A double gold disc for the music
directors. Someday I'll get mine too.

168
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:07,589
l've recorded my voice on
a cassette... Rohit...!

169
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:09,897
l've recorded one of
my songs in a cassette.

170
00:32:10,568 --> 00:32:15,437
- Will you please give it
to Gulbadan Kumar? - All right.

171
00:32:17,842 --> 00:32:22,302
Hows the good lady? I greet you
in the name of The Divine Mother.

172
00:32:23,214 --> 00:32:26,445
- Hello. - I'm Rohit Kumar.
- Of course, Mr. Rohit Kumar.

173
00:32:26,818 --> 00:32:28,911
- Greetings! - Grand party.
- It's modest really.

174
00:32:29,954 --> 00:32:33,856
- Have you listened to my cassette?
- Yes I did. - Did you like it?

175
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:37,118
- Very nice.
- Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir.

176
00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:44,263
Glory be to The Divine Mother!

177
00:32:45,336 --> 00:32:48,430
Congratulations, Mr. Gulbadan!
You're raking in gold discs.

178
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,205
Let's pose for a photograph.

179
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,074
- You're the biggest of them all.
- Not at all. - lsn't it, now?

180
00:32:55,647 --> 00:33:01,415
It's the two of you, Messrs Amar &
Kaushik who are the most well known.

181
00:33:01,753 --> 00:33:06,588
That's the magic of our music.
We've defined 6 super hit films.

182
00:33:06,991 --> 00:33:09,687
- Our critics are now silenced.
- lndeed. lndeed, Mr. Gulbadan.

183
00:33:10,128 --> 00:33:13,063
You must listen to the music
we've scored for our next film.

184
00:33:13,331 --> 00:33:15,925
- The Divine Mother be praised. - We
recorded a song yesterday. Beautiful!

185
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:19,263
Which film is the song meant for?

186
00:33:20,238 --> 00:33:24,038
Well... he's an upcoming artiste.
He's also a singer.

187
00:33:24,475 --> 00:33:27,239
- Mr. Rahul Kumar.
- I'm Rohit Kumar, Sir.

188
00:33:27,612 --> 00:33:28,943
Oh yes,... Mr. Rohit Kumar.

189
00:33:29,314 --> 00:33:30,781
- Do you sing?
- Yes, Sir.

190
00:33:31,783 --> 00:33:33,273
I see. For whom
have you sung till now?

191
00:33:33,985 --> 00:33:39,651
- Nothing special yet. - Yes. Go on.
- I want to sing for you.- Of course.

192
00:33:41,592 --> 00:33:43,992
- Don't forget to give my cassette.
- Oh yes. But, stop it now, will you?

193
00:33:44,729 --> 00:33:47,960
- Yes... what is it?
- I'm not only a singer.

194
00:33:48,766 --> 00:33:49,858
l've written a few songs too.

195
00:33:51,235 --> 00:33:53,567
- And what are you?!
- A composer.

196
00:33:54,906 --> 00:33:58,273
ln a country like ours, just
about anyone can turn a composer.

197
00:34:00,144 --> 00:34:05,707
Call me up on Monday. If your
voice is worth it, you're made.

198
00:34:07,852 --> 00:34:09,012
I'll come over on Monday
after giving you a call.

199
00:34:09,387 --> 00:34:10,649
What more could you want?
Glory be to The Divine Mother.

200
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,752
- Mr. Gulbadan...
- Yes, Sir.

201
00:34:13,324 --> 00:34:15,019
Why aren't you giving
him my cassette?

202
00:34:15,493 --> 00:34:16,687
- I can't give the cassette now.
- Why?

203
00:34:17,128 --> 00:34:20,120
- It was so difficult getting an
audition for myself. - So what?

204
00:34:20,565 --> 00:34:22,829
How can I ask them to
audition my wife too?

205
00:34:23,201 --> 00:34:25,499
They'll think I'm trying to
force my family down their throats.

206
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:49,588
- So, d'you feel that I'm imposing
myself upon you? - I never said that.

207
00:34:50,528 --> 00:34:54,692
- That's what you meant! - I'm tired
and I don't want to get into a fight.

208
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:56,294
D'you mean to say that l
want to get into a fight?

209
00:34:56,868 --> 00:34:57,562
Sonu is sleeping.

210
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:05,637
l'd only asked you to hand over
my cassette. Was it so difficult?

211
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,312
I haven't heard what you've recorded.
I don't even know what's in it.

212
00:35:11,649 --> 00:35:14,618
I don't know if it's worth a hearing.
And, it was tough getting an audition.

213
00:35:14,986 --> 00:35:17,454
Must I lose a chance by trying
to push your cassette?

214
00:35:20,525 --> 00:35:24,552
An hour ago, you loved my voice.
Now, it isn't worth auditioning!

215
00:35:24,695 --> 00:35:27,289
I don't mean that. One must practice
regularly to be able to sing properly.

216
00:35:27,565 --> 00:35:31,934
Just another excuse! And I think l
understand you perfectly, Rohit.

217
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,871
You've been pursuing your career.
And all I get are flimsy excuses.

218
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:38,833
- Please don't scream.
- Why don't you say it plainly?

219
00:35:39,143 --> 00:35:45,378
That I don't have the aesthetics.
That I should stop dreaming about...

220
00:35:46,384 --> 00:35:48,614
...becoming a professional singer.
That's not what's going to be, Rohit.

221
00:35:48,986 --> 00:35:53,889
I won't give up! And you for one,
cannot break my resolve! Get that?

222
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,033
I don't know why Rohit is doing
this. He mustn't do this to you.

223
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:07,165
- It's wrong on his part. - We've
finished our homework, Mother.

224
00:36:07,505 --> 00:36:10,702
- May we go to play? - Make sure
you return soon. - All right.

225
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:19,747
You have the right to a career.
Why don't you discuss it with Rohit?

226
00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:27,747
What are you doing here? I've been
looking for you so long.

227
00:36:28,626 --> 00:36:30,617
- I had to discuss some
things with Farida. - What?

228
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:33,256
Besides Sonu is getting on my nerves.
Who is to take care of him?

229
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:36,359
I have to go to a rehearsal. Where
are my clothes? How about some food?

230
00:36:37,268 --> 00:36:41,329
- I'm coming over. - And, where's
the file of my songs?

231
00:36:41,706 --> 00:36:44,334
l've been looking for it all day.
I just can't find it.

232
00:36:44,642 --> 00:36:46,439
l'd brought it down with me for my
practice session.

233
00:36:52,517 --> 00:36:55,645
Why don't you just sit over here for
the rest of the day practicing!

234
00:36:55,987 --> 00:36:58,114
- I said I'm coming. - Don't bother.
You can practice singing...

235
00:36:58,422 --> 00:36:59,980
...for the rest of the day. I'll
feed myself at a restaurant.

236
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:03,191
- I'll look after the household too.
- Have I ever refused to do all that?

237
00:37:14,272 --> 00:37:17,605
- What've you done? - Sorry, Mother.
- You've got my washing all dirty.

238
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:22,946
l've been at the laundry for 2 hours.
And I've asked you not to play here.

239
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:27,180
How many times have l
asked you not to play?!

240
00:37:28,586 --> 00:37:31,555
What's up, Kiran? Why did you beat
him? What has he done?

241
00:37:32,023 --> 00:37:36,084
He won't listen to me. And now,
he's got the laundry all dirty.

242
00:37:37,461 --> 00:37:42,262
I'm sick and tired of chorus all day.
l've gone out of my mind.

243
00:37:53,878 --> 00:38:00,113
We tread upon the same path, Kiran.
What could be better for both of us?

244
00:38:46,864 --> 00:38:55,397
Open up, quickly.
Come on, hurry up.

245
00:38:58,042 --> 00:39:02,069
Make sure to remember the day today.
We'll celebrate this day every year.

246
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,677
This is the day I've awaited forever.
The day on which my career commences!

247
00:39:06,217 --> 00:39:10,984
Today was the day! Amar-Kaushik were
left speechless after I auditioned.

248
00:39:11,322 --> 00:39:14,553
I'm singing the first song
for Pawan Chopra's new film.

249
00:39:15,326 --> 00:39:16,725
I'm leaving, Rohit.

250
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:21,354
And they said that if this song
passes the muster while recording...

251
00:39:21,732 --> 00:39:24,929
...I'll get to sing all the songs
for the film. I'm recording tomorrow.

252
00:39:25,436 --> 00:39:27,199
- Want to come along?
- I said I'm leaving.

253
00:39:28,306 --> 00:39:30,331
- Where are you going?
- Here are the keys to the house.

254
00:39:30,908 --> 00:39:34,002
These are the rationing cards...and
here are the bills for the month.

255
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:35,675
l've paid all the bills.

256
00:39:36,414 --> 00:39:38,712
You'll find the balance of the
money in the cupboard.

257
00:39:39,483 --> 00:39:43,920
Here's the electricity bill. Make
sure you pay it up by the weekend.

258
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,017
I'm leaving you.

259
00:39:48,392 --> 00:39:50,986
Wait a minute! What are you saying?
What's happened?

260
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:54,354
- Have I done anything wrong?
- No, you haven't. - What's it then?

261
00:39:54,732 --> 00:39:55,756
- Tell me.
- Don't touch me!

262
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:59,030
- Just let me go. - But why are
you leaving? Say something!

263
00:39:59,337 --> 00:40:05,105
Why don't you understand! It isn't
just an isolated something.

264
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,600
It might be my mistake too.

265
00:40:08,612 --> 00:40:12,446
- Something is happening to me.
- What's this with you?

266
00:40:13,617 --> 00:40:17,212
- I don't know! - It's nothing more
than a figment of your imagination.

267
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:28,026
-I must make a life for myself. -But
this and here, is what your life is!

268
00:40:31,736 --> 00:40:33,966
Else, I'll go out of my mind.

269
00:40:36,607 --> 00:40:41,510
So you want to walk out of this
marriage. But what of Sonu?

270
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,041
How can you walk out on him?

271
00:40:46,884 --> 00:40:50,684
But, he's better off without me.

272
00:40:50,988 --> 00:40:54,856
Oh God! I don't believe this! Kiran!
Why are you doing this to me?!

273
00:40:55,693 --> 00:41:00,187
l've just got my golden chance. And
here you are...walking out on me!

274
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:06,064
I need you, Kiran. If you stand by
me, I can even reach for the stars.

275
00:41:07,538 --> 00:41:10,006
But you had told me that we'd reach
out for the stars together.

276
00:41:14,812 --> 00:41:17,645
D'you feel that I'm trying to stop
you from becoming a singer?

277
00:41:18,182 --> 00:41:20,946
You might dream of becoming a singer.

278
00:41:21,419 --> 00:41:24,445
But don't expect me to go around
singing false praises for you.

279
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:33,396
I lost my head. I agree that both
of us have made mistakes.

280
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:35,924
But that doesn't mean that you must
walk out of your home. lsn't that so?

281
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:40,197
We can always mend our ways.
Now , come in.

282
00:41:42,173 --> 00:41:43,834
Now you're being stubborn. Just
like your parents.

283
00:41:45,242 --> 00:41:48,507
-Don't drag my parents into this.
-Why not? You carry the same traits.

284
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:50,574
Now, are you going to stop
taunting my parents?!

285
00:41:50,881 --> 00:41:53,145
Won't l! They haven't been able to
achieve anything in life.

286
00:41:53,484 --> 00:41:54,746
And they're jealous of others.

287
00:41:57,955 --> 00:42:00,924
- And d'you think I'm jealous of
your success? - Yes!

288
00:42:03,494 --> 00:42:06,486
Thank you very much.
I won't ever forget that.

289
00:42:07,364 --> 00:42:13,325
l'd rather suffer my traits than
your taunts for the rest of my life.

290
00:42:35,493 --> 00:42:38,087
Where has Kiran gone?

291
00:42:39,797 --> 00:42:42,766
- What I should be asking you?
- Why me?

292
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,725
Because she used to spend more than
half her working hours in your company.

293
00:42:46,036 --> 00:42:49,904
And the two of you must've more than
discussed my weak points.

294
00:42:50,474 --> 00:42:53,272
Forget all that. Kiran has left you.

295
00:42:53,677 --> 00:42:56,237
- We must do something about it.
- Not ''we''. It's I who has to do.

296
00:42:56,514 --> 00:42:58,311
And I'll do whatever must be done.

297
00:42:58,649 --> 00:43:03,109
You must try to understand it now
or never. Kiran is very unhappy.

298
00:43:03,487 --> 00:43:05,546
- And the fact is that... - Fact
remains that of the past 6 years...

299
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,858
... I've been trying heart and soul
to get a break...

300
00:43:08,158 --> 00:43:10,854
... so that my career can take off;
so that my life shapes up!

301
00:43:12,162 --> 00:43:14,995
After 6 long years, I get a break.
I'm slated to sing for Amar-Kaushik!

302
00:43:15,299 --> 00:43:17,130
I took a cab home as soon as I got
to know; so that I could...

303
00:43:17,468 --> 00:43:20,528
... share the greatest moment of
my life with her.

304
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:23,136
And she tells me that she's
walking out of my life.

305
00:43:23,741 --> 00:43:29,270
- What does it mean?! - She couldn't
share the greatest moment of your life.

306
00:43:29,446 --> 00:43:35,009
- It's your life, after all.
- You're fantastic!

307
00:43:36,587 --> 00:43:40,114
That your husband deserted you
because you were unhappy...

308
00:43:40,424 --> 00:43:43,587
... doesn't mean that every woman
is unhappy with her husband.

309
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:52,397
I haven't come here to discuss my
husband. I'm concerned about Kiran.

310
00:43:53,103 --> 00:43:56,004
- You may keep your concern within
your confines. - I shall.

311
00:43:56,507 --> 00:44:00,307
Before I leave, let me tell you that
you could never understand Kiran.

312
00:44:00,811 --> 00:44:03,575
She is no petty woman to serve as
a part of your interior decor.

313
00:44:03,914 --> 00:44:07,873
She had her own dreams. And it
takes courage for a woman to walk out.

314
00:44:08,986 --> 00:44:15,687
Yes! And it takes more to walk out
on a helpless child. lsn't that so?

315
00:44:51,762 --> 00:45:00,602
- Why are you sleeping here?
- Oh.. what? - And where's Mummy?

316
00:45:04,942 --> 00:45:07,638
- Tell me... Where's Mummy?
- What's the time now?

317
00:45:09,146 --> 00:45:11,876
The small hand is on 7.
And the big hand is on 3.

318
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:16,014
I'm going to be late
for the recording.

319
00:45:16,453 --> 00:45:20,549
- Tell me, Daddy... where's Mummy?
- Wait a minute.

320
00:45:23,794 --> 00:45:28,595
- You mother has gone to your aunt's.
- Which aunt?

321
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:35,037
-The one in Pune. -Aunt Ratna lives
there. - That's where she has gone.

322
00:45:35,906 --> 00:45:41,037
- When is she going to come back?
- Very soon.. in 3 or 4 days.

323
00:45:41,478 --> 00:45:44,743
Now make a move.
l've got to get ready.

324
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:49,909
- Who's going to get me ready
for school? - I will, son.

325
00:45:51,488 --> 00:45:53,581
- And, who'll pack my school bag?
- I will.

326
00:45:56,026 --> 00:45:59,325
- Who'll take me to school?
- I will.

327
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:04,567
- What about my breakfast? - l...
what do you eat for breakfast?

328
00:46:05,002 --> 00:46:08,438
An omelette of 2 eggs, toast with
butter and Bournvita.

329
00:46:13,777 --> 00:46:17,907
A dash of coriander... and onions.
Ever had one of my omelets?

330
00:46:18,248 --> 00:46:22,810
- No.
- Try it today. You'll love it.

331
00:46:25,255 --> 00:46:29,248
- You're cutting them in such
large chunks! - That's just fine.

332
00:46:30,861 --> 00:46:32,692
lsn't this fun! Yes, it's fun.

333
00:46:33,731 --> 00:46:38,725
Now, take a look at this.. a circus
with one hand... two eggs in one hand!

334
00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:41,367
Now take a look at how I break
both eggs using one hand.

335
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:47,802
The eggs had soft-shells.
But never mind.

336
00:46:51,482 --> 00:46:53,507
This place is perfectly clean.

337
00:46:54,918 --> 00:46:58,615
What are you doing?
I'm not going to eat that!

338
00:46:59,056 --> 00:47:02,992
- It has shells in it. - A few
shells will make the omelette crisp.

339
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,128
- Here go the onions... and the
chilies. - Not that way! - How else?

340
00:47:06,597 --> 00:47:10,226
Mummy used to flip the
ingredients first.

341
00:47:10,734 --> 00:47:14,261
What Mummy doesn't know is that an
omelette is an omelette, flip or flap!

342
00:47:15,272 --> 00:47:18,730
Eat it and you'll know. Later on,
I'll drop you at the school.

343
00:47:19,009 --> 00:47:21,978
And afterwards, I'm off to record
my first song ever!

344
00:47:22,446 --> 00:47:25,540
Your Daddy is going to
become a famous singer.

345
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:29,441
- What's up?
- The toast is burning!

346
00:47:30,888 --> 00:47:33,288
Well, never mind that.

347
00:47:45,636 --> 00:47:47,035
You don't know a thing!

348
00:47:49,273 --> 00:47:53,607
Go on in... hurry.
Go inside.

349
00:47:54,511 --> 00:47:56,445
- Who'll come to pick me up?
- I'll come.

350
00:47:57,147 --> 00:47:58,444
Where are you going to
wait for me?

351
00:48:00,017 --> 00:48:02,611
I'll wait for you under this tree,
okay? Now go on inside.

352
00:48:03,387 --> 00:48:06,356
- What if you don't turn up?
- I said I'll come. And, I will.

353
00:48:07,024 --> 00:48:10,858
- What if you're late? - I won't
be late. I'll be here on time.

354
00:48:11,361 --> 00:48:18,665
- What if you're still late? - If
I am, you can wait under the tree.

355
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:21,437
Go on, now. Hurry.

356
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,271
- When does the school get over?
- No idea.

357
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:33,579
When does the junior school
get over?

358
00:48:34,518 --> 00:48:37,578
- I'm that child's father.
- At 2 o'clock.

359
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,829
- I'm sorry to be late.
- ls this your idea of time?

360
00:48:54,671 --> 00:48:57,333
You've turned a star even before
you've recorded a single song.

361
00:48:57,708 --> 00:49:01,940
-I got stuck in the traffic. - Never
mind. Sit inside and get the lines.

362
00:49:02,246 --> 00:49:04,339
We'll record the orchestra in the
meantime. Let's have another take.

363
00:49:04,815 --> 00:49:10,617
- Give him his lines, will you?
- Come on for the break in your life.

364
00:49:13,857 --> 00:49:15,848
- We can fit the 16 tracks on to 12.
- Very well. Let's try.

365
00:49:20,831 --> 00:49:22,059
Let's have the rhythm.

366
00:49:25,903 --> 00:49:30,363
Still waiting here? I'm afraid
we won't be recording you today.

367
00:49:31,141 --> 00:49:34,338
- Sir...?
- lncrease the bass slightly.

368
00:49:34,711 --> 00:49:39,375
- When will I record?
- After a couple of days perhaps.

369
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,183
Do keep calling to find out.

370
00:50:11,748 --> 00:50:14,478
I'm late by only half-an-hour.
Must you be so upset?

371
00:50:14,785 --> 00:50:18,050
- You said you'd be here on time.
- I did. But I was so busy.

372
00:50:19,056 --> 00:50:23,356
- What if someone kidnapped me?
- But no one did?

373
00:50:23,794 --> 00:50:25,318
What if someone did?

374
00:50:26,663 --> 00:50:29,996
l've told ten times that
I'm sorry.

375
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,359
You must forgive
someone who apologizes.

376
00:50:32,803 --> 00:50:34,100
Do you know the meaning
of the word ''sorry''?

377
00:50:38,141 --> 00:50:39,199
What are you doing?

378
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:42,702
What's up?

379
00:50:45,248 --> 00:50:50,379
This car run on batteries. It has a
horn. And, the headlights work too.

380
00:50:50,921 --> 00:50:55,881
- So what?
- I'll forgive you if you buy me one.

381
00:50:58,261 --> 00:51:00,354
What if I don't? Won't
you forgive me ever?

382
00:51:03,033 --> 00:51:05,433
Had it been Mummy, she would've got
the car for me.

383
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:09,430
Ask your mother for one when she
comes back. Now, let's go. Come on.

384
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,490
- 250 grams of lentil... anything
else? - A packet of tea.

385
00:52:40,497 --> 00:52:43,489
- The Red Label, or the Yellow?
- Yellow. - Not Yellow. The Red one.

386
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:47,999
- Why? - Because Mummy used to buy
the Red Label. - Give me red.

387
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:53,608
A pack of soap and coconut oil.

388
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:59,346
- Can I have a chocolate?
- Take these upstairs.

389
00:53:04,921 --> 00:53:08,550
Forgive me for asking this... but l
heard something. ls it true?

390
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:15,662
I heard that your wife left your...
no, I mean to say that she didn't...

391
00:53:15,966 --> 00:53:18,867
... care for you. She didn't care
for the child. Nor her status!

392
00:53:19,236 --> 00:53:20,066
Let me have this package.

393
00:53:20,504 --> 00:53:24,998
And I didn't like her either.
She used to have this temper.

394
00:53:25,342 --> 00:53:27,776
Have I asked you what you liked
or disliked about my wife?

395
00:53:28,111 --> 00:53:29,840
- No, I mean...
- Have I asked for your opinion?

396
00:53:31,181 --> 00:53:34,617
I come here to buy groceries. Not
to listen to your useless banter.

397
00:53:35,418 --> 00:53:37,579
- Do you understand?
- Understood. Here's your stuff.

398
00:53:38,355 --> 00:53:42,348
That's worth 300. The balance last
month was 350, totaling 650 bucks.

399
00:53:42,893 --> 00:53:45,828
- And I've stopped giving credit.
- I'm not asking for it.

400
00:53:46,329 --> 00:53:52,393
Here's your money. 550.. and I'm
sending 100 bucks for you right away.

401
00:53:55,572 --> 00:53:56,903
That's the credit.

402
00:54:14,925 --> 00:54:16,859
- ls that all right, Mr. Manohar?
- Yes. Let's record it.

403
00:54:17,827 --> 00:54:21,263
Thank you, Mr. Sharma for letting
my friend sing in the chorus.

404
00:54:22,232 --> 00:54:26,999
- She'll even sing a lead part if
you let her do it. - Of course.

405
00:54:28,004 --> 00:54:30,973
Shall we proceed, Mr. Manohar?

406
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:35,303
Take a look at this!
A letter from Mummy.

407
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,178
A letter from Mummy! Here!

408
00:54:40,617 --> 00:54:43,450
- I see... it's addressed to you.
- Oh yes! It is.

409
00:54:43,887 --> 00:54:45,878
Read it, quickly. And tell me when
Mummy is coming home.

410
00:54:52,996 --> 00:54:54,861
- Read it aloud.
- Oh, yes.

411
00:54:56,499 --> 00:54:57,625
''My dear Sunil...''

412
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:03,803
''You must be wondering where your
Mummy has gone all of a sudden.''

413
00:55:04,641 --> 00:55:07,667
''Let me explain this... sometimes
your Daddy had to leave home.''

414
00:55:07,944 --> 00:55:09,673
''And then, it was Mummy
who looked after you.''

415
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,977
''Sometimes, when mothers leave,
fathers have to look after children.''

416
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:19,284
''Your Mummy wants to make a
career for herself, Sunil.''

417
00:55:19,823 --> 00:55:22,223
''That's why I had to
leave your home.''

418
00:55:24,461 --> 00:55:29,057
''I may not live with you anymore.
But, you'll remain in my heart.''

419
00:55:29,899 --> 00:55:33,426
''Don't ever think that
Mummy will forget you.''

420
00:55:34,037 --> 00:55:38,167
''I remain your Mummy always.
And I'll love you always.''

421
00:55:39,509 --> 00:55:43,775
''Take care of yourself. And, on
your way back from school everyday...''

422
00:56:15,378 --> 00:56:19,041
That was marvelous. Ms. Vandana.
And you must concentrate, Rohit.

423
00:56:19,983 --> 00:56:21,644
I want the right perspective
in your voice.

424
00:56:22,085 --> 00:56:24,053
Don't sing in a stifled voice.
Open your voice up.

425
00:56:26,156 --> 00:56:32,493
That's my file, Sir. It contains
the songs I have written.

426
00:56:32,829 --> 00:56:34,194
Don't be afraid.
We won't steal your tunes.

427
00:56:34,531 --> 00:56:35,793
No! I didn't mean that.

428
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:38,425
Let's proceed with another take.

429
00:56:41,404 --> 00:56:43,099
Let's have a rehearsal without
the music accompaniment.

430
00:56:49,846 --> 00:56:53,043
That's a lot of crap! Let's have
some real voice. Haven't you eaten?

431
00:57:03,793 --> 00:57:05,283
- Go on... sing it.
- Yes, Sir.

432
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:18,601
Forget about turning a music
director and concentrate on singing.

433
00:57:21,277 --> 00:57:23,643
- I'll ruin his happiness.
- Why! We have a composer!

434
00:57:29,986 --> 00:57:32,181
- Go on.
- Yes, Sir.

435
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:39,519
Nonsense! Forget it. Please sing
his lines for him, Ms. Vandana.

436
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:55,570
- Well done, Ms. Vandana. Excellent.
- Did you get an idea of the tune?

437
00:57:55,879 --> 00:58:00,839
- That's what I've been singing.
- Sing it properly! - Yes, Sir.

438
00:58:06,923 --> 00:58:11,792
What are you doing! You're out
of tune! What are you up to?!

439
00:58:12,162 --> 00:58:13,424
- Please let me finish my lines.
- Shut up!

440
00:58:13,863 --> 00:58:17,196
- If you interrupt, you can't
appreciate the singing. - Shut up!

441
00:58:18,935 --> 00:58:21,768
0-Please listen to me. -Bloody fool!
Shut up! Who d'you think you are?

442
00:58:22,071 --> 00:58:24,539
Stay within your limits!
Else I'll throw you out of here.

443
00:58:24,908 --> 00:58:26,466
And, I'll banish you forever
from filmdom.

444
00:58:27,076 --> 00:58:31,638
Will a singer in a night club to
teach me how to compose music?!

445
00:58:32,248 --> 00:58:35,411
- Yes. I can.
- What! What was it you said?!

446
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:38,448
Oh yes! I'll teach you how to score
music right away.

447
00:58:38,755 --> 00:58:40,120
That is, if you may dare
to listen to me.

448
00:58:40,523 --> 00:58:41,956
lsn't this how you've composed it?

449
00:58:46,863 --> 00:58:48,524
lsn't that your song?
Now listen to this.

450
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:50,633
Please play along with me.

451
00:59:34,878 --> 00:59:37,472
What are you up to, Sunil?
Be quiet and eat your food.

452
00:59:38,581 --> 00:59:39,377
Pick up your spoon.

453
00:59:41,251 --> 00:59:45,813
Go on. Eat.

454
00:59:46,189 --> 00:59:48,589
- It's yucky. - It's bell plant and
it's very good for you. Go on, eat it.

455
00:59:49,492 --> 00:59:54,520
-I don't like bell plants. -You do.
Aunt Farida has cooked it for you.

456
00:59:54,797 --> 00:59:55,525
And you've eaten it earlier.

457
00:59:56,866 --> 00:59:59,061
- What's all this black stuff
in this? - Onions. Now eat it.

458
00:59:59,602 --> 01:00:04,904
-Onions give me stomachaches. -Not
at all. And now start with the bread.

459
01:00:12,916 --> 01:00:15,146
- It's Yucky.
- You mustn't call food ''yucky''.

460
01:00:16,486 --> 01:00:20,422
Don't spit on your plate.
Where are your manners?

461
01:00:21,624 --> 01:00:23,558
Go on. Eat it now.
There... I've removed the onions.

462
01:00:33,903 --> 01:00:37,464
There's this chocolate ice-cream
you've brought. It's in the fridge.

463
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:41,506
Yes I know about the ice cream.
But, you won't get any of it.

464
01:00:41,945 --> 01:00:44,573
You must finish your food first.
Only afterwards you may eat it.

465
01:00:44,948 --> 01:00:46,108
Sunil!... Where are you going?

466
01:00:47,016 --> 01:00:47,983
Don't you open the fridge!

467
01:00:49,953 --> 01:00:51,716
Now don't take the ice-cream out
of the fridge.

468
01:00:53,089 --> 01:00:57,116
Can't you hear me? I'm getting
very angry with this now.

469
01:01:00,863 --> 01:01:03,855
Don't take the ice cream.
I'm warning you, Sunil.

470
01:01:05,735 --> 01:01:08,761
I'm warning you.
Don't you dare eat that ice cream.

471
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:17,073
Eat the ice-cream and you'll face
dire consequences. D'you understand?

472
01:01:20,383 --> 01:01:24,012
Get up. Now!
And let go of the chair.

473
01:01:24,721 --> 01:01:27,087
You unmannered boy!
And stop screaming.

474
01:01:29,425 --> 01:01:31,222
- I want to got to Mummy!
- Enough of it.

475
01:01:31,694 --> 01:01:33,787
No food for you. Nor any ice cream.
You can go to sleep hungry.

476
01:01:34,497 --> 01:01:35,623
I won't talk to you ever again.

477
01:02:24,914 --> 01:02:25,573
He's asleep.

478
01:02:41,798 --> 01:02:52,003
Will you leave me and go away too?

479
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:57,809
- Never.
- But Mummy left me and went away.

480
01:02:58,314 --> 01:03:00,748
- That's because I'm a bad boy.
- ls that what you think?

481
01:03:01,184 --> 01:03:13,324
That isn't true. Mummy loves you.
She didn't leave because of you.

482
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:18,298
She left because
I couldn't understand her.

483
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:22,802
I wanted her to do what all other
mothers do all their lives...

484
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:28,370
... tending the family and doing
household chores.

485
01:03:30,246 --> 01:03:38,017
But she wanted to do something else.
And she tried to reason with me.

486
01:03:38,788 --> 01:03:46,285
But I was too involved
with my life and myself.

487
01:03:47,263 --> 01:03:51,927
And do you know why she
stayed back so long with us?

488
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:55,460
That's because she loved you, son.

489
01:03:57,774 --> 01:04:03,144
She didn't leave us because of you.
She left because of me.

490
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:11,587
Now, go to sleep.

491
01:04:14,123 --> 01:04:20,961
Let's start a new life from
tomorrow... you and me.

492
01:09:26,035 --> 01:09:29,436
- Let's have another ride. - No.
I'm tired. Go on. Play by yourself.

493
01:09:34,443 --> 01:09:36,001
You've changed so completely, Rohit.

494
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:41,206
I only wish Kiran should've
seen you in these spirits.

495
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:43,581
- Don't talk about Kiran.
- Very well.

496
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:49,186
- Tell me the truth... don't you
ever think about her? - Not at all.

497
01:09:53,863 --> 01:09:56,457
Look at me, Daddy!

498
01:09:58,067 --> 01:10:00,558
- Don't do that, Sunil.
- No! It's my turn now!

499
01:10:02,004 --> 01:10:08,933
- Don't you think about your husband?
- His case was quite different.

500
01:10:09,879 --> 01:10:15,647
- He had started having an affair.
- Really? I had no idea. Who was it?

501
01:10:16,418 --> 01:10:21,549
He had this girl in his office. And
my Romeo wanted to bring her home.

502
01:10:21,957 --> 01:10:22,946
What nonsense!

503
01:10:23,959 --> 01:10:26,951
Look at me now, Daddy!
I'm coming down standing up!

504
01:10:27,296 --> 01:10:30,356
- No, Sonu. What are you up to?
Get down. - I'll get him down.

505
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:36,862
- What happened afterwards? - I told
him he was free to do what he liked.

506
01:10:37,173 --> 01:10:38,970
But I wouldn't let go of the house.
It's for my children and me.

507
01:10:39,608 --> 01:10:45,444
- No! Sonu!
- Watch your step, Sonu!

508
01:10:45,681 --> 01:10:47,080
What's happened, Sonu?!

509
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:48,908
Take him to a hospital. Hurry!

510
01:11:05,534 --> 01:11:09,026
Nothing's going to happen to you,
Sonu. You're going to be all right.

511
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:28,685
I'll treat you
to ice creams afterwards.

512
01:11:58,287 --> 01:12:02,451
I'm Ravinder Kapoor. I'm the chief
assistant director in RP Films.

513
01:12:03,025 --> 01:12:05,516
- I see. - I have come
here for a sound transfer.

514
01:12:05,961 --> 01:12:08,953
I saw your friend all of a sudden.
She's very good.

515
01:12:09,465 --> 01:12:12,059
My director wants a smart girl as he
is about to shoot an important scene.

516
01:12:12,434 --> 01:12:15,130
The role is that of a friend
to the leading lady.

517
01:12:15,504 --> 01:12:18,837
No. Not stand-by.

518
01:12:19,608 --> 01:12:22,702
You don't know Mr. Kapoor.

519
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,572
That's right. Mr. Paresh Kapoor.

520
01:12:26,849 --> 01:12:31,809
- You must've seen his film last
year. - Yes. - It was a super hit.

521
01:12:32,221 --> 01:12:33,313
It's still raking in royalties.

522
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:37,987
- How many days is she to work
at it? - It's only a day's shoot.

523
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,155
- But...
- How much money will she make?

524
01:12:40,562 --> 01:12:43,554
2000. And I'll make sure she
gets 100 bucks as conveyance.

525
01:12:45,968 --> 01:12:49,199
- I'll speak to her about it.
- Please do try. I'll wait for you.

526
01:13:04,653 --> 01:13:07,884
l've dumped Sunju.
He says that I'm selfish.

527
01:13:08,624 --> 01:13:11,559
He asked me why I went to see
a film when he was sick.

528
01:13:12,461 --> 01:13:16,192
I couldn't bore myself sitting
by him all evening; now could l?

529
01:13:16,665 --> 01:13:18,189
Have I done anything wrong?

530
01:13:20,102 --> 01:13:22,662
Tell me, Anjali... have
I done anything wrong?

531
01:13:26,475 --> 01:13:27,965
You were supposed to
deliver your lines.

532
01:13:28,744 --> 01:13:29,972
Don't you remember your lines?

533
01:13:34,283 --> 01:13:35,807
Will she be able to
deliver the lines?

534
01:13:36,418 --> 01:13:41,822
You wanted someone simple and
innocent. She'll deliver all right.

535
01:13:42,825 --> 01:13:44,793
Didn't I tell you that I don't
know anything about acting?

536
01:13:48,831 --> 01:13:50,492
All you have to do
is to my your lines.

537
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:57,138
Tell me, Anjali...
What have I done wrong?

538
01:13:59,475 --> 01:14:03,002
You haven't done
the right thing, Deepa.

539
01:14:05,748 --> 01:14:09,479
D'you remember how anxious he
was when you had fallen sick?

540
01:14:09,852 --> 01:14:14,152
He kept by you and cared
for you like a man possessed.

541
01:14:15,057 --> 01:14:19,790
And you can't even spare
an evening for him!

542
01:14:20,362 --> 01:14:22,091
You call that boredom.

543
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:28,063
The truth is that you've
never even understood Sunju.

544
01:14:29,104 --> 01:14:30,867
He loves you very much.

545
01:14:34,476 --> 01:14:37,343
She's going on saying
whatever she wants to.

546
01:14:42,484 --> 01:14:44,645
l'd told you earlier that l
know nothing about acting.

547
01:14:45,287 --> 01:14:52,352
I tried it at my friend's instance.
I really want to become a singer.

548
01:14:53,429 --> 01:14:58,958
- Very well... you may sing some.
- Sir...?!

549
01:15:54,423 --> 01:15:57,085
- Please listen to the songs I've
scored. - I've helped you already.

550
01:15:57,526 --> 01:16:00,723
I introduced you to Amar Kaushik.
And you've disgraced me.

551
01:16:01,296 --> 01:16:05,062
- They started misbehaving with me.
- Will they really misbehave?

552
01:16:06,468 --> 01:16:09,562
- You see, Mr.Gulbadan. - You see,
Mr. Rohit, I merely run...

553
01:16:09,805 --> 01:16:12,638
.. a small-time music company. We
only publish records and cassettes.

554
01:16:13,075 --> 01:16:19,071
I'm not a film producer.
Now, please excuse me.

555
01:16:22,885 --> 01:16:25,683
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Please take your time.

556
01:16:26,455 --> 01:16:28,821
One minute, Mr. Rohit.

557
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:31,149
I can help you sell your songs.

558
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:36,720
Amar Kaushik needs new tunes.
I'll get you 2000 for each tune.

559
01:16:37,099 --> 01:16:40,034
- Here's my card. - So they get
the credit for my compositions.

560
01:16:40,469 --> 01:16:41,595
Why bother about the credit?

561
01:16:53,649 --> 01:16:57,312
You want me to give you a job so
you can walk out on me again.

562
01:16:58,153 --> 01:17:03,648
That won't happen ever again. I beg
your pardon. Please give me a chance.

563
01:17:42,331 --> 01:17:45,323
- lsn't that, Mrs. Kiran?
- Yes. She's Rohit Kumar's wife.

564
01:17:45,701 --> 01:17:47,896
- She's made a heroine in films.
- She used to sing.

565
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:50,429
And now, she's up to
dancing in public.

566
01:17:50,973 --> 01:17:55,034
Come quickly, Dad.
Take a look... over there.

567
01:17:55,344 --> 01:17:56,936
It's Mummy's picture.

568
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,938
They put up the posters today.

569
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:06,549
I want to see Mummy's film. You'll
take me to see it, won't you?

570
01:18:07,055 --> 01:18:11,958
You'll take me, won't you, Daddy?...
Won't you, Daddy? Please tell me.
