1
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,509
Some years ago...
A class room...

2
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,689
Food chain.

3
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,297
Grass hopper eats grass.

4
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,527
Frog eats grass hopper.

5
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,169
For frog, snake.

6
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,637
For snake, eagle.

7
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:26,973
This is the cycle of transferring energy.

8
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:33,350
We all belong to any one of
this cycle of food chain.

9
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:39,454
That means, we eat food for living...
for maintaining our...

10
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,787
...life, right?

11
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,053
- No, Sir.
- Aa!

12
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,963
Why so, Kalidasan?

13
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,601
We are living to eat food, right?

14
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:58,435
Is it newly harvested rice?

15
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:03,631
Is it your shining beautiful smile?

16
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,267
Your beautiful smile.

17
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:10,640
Is it newly harvested rice?

18
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,810
Is it your shining beautiful smile?

19
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,217
Your beautiful smile.

20
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:30,494
Hey, you who had wiped your eyes
after eating the fried fish...

21
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:35,336
...marinated with red chilly.

22
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:48,977
The sweet pudding...

23
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:54,287
...which serves in banana leaves
without floating.

24
00:04:54,394 --> 00:05:00,333
The dream pudding will spread
like love even after...

25
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:04,460
...taking with left and right hand.

26
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,639
The coolness of the mango tree.

27
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,949
It's the golden treasure in summer heat.

28
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:32,196
Ripe mango which slips like
banana mixed in curd curry...

29
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:37,736
...you who will skip like that.

30
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:56,745
Decorated by chopping
and mashing the skin of raw...

31
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,915
...jack fruit.

32
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:11,102
While drinking rice soup
with the leaves of jack tree...

33
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,798
...come close to wipe the sweat.

34
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:30,516
Don't you want nice
hot duck roast to eat parotta.

35
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:44,830
May I serve you rice steamed
in bamboo stem to eat?

36
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,176
After some years...

37
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,439
There is one basket of gold...

38
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,807
...for the bride to wear.

39
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,710
Don't worry it's a song.

40
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,073
- Okay.
- Okay.

41
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,776
Don't cry my pearl.

42
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,181
You are my dearest.

43
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:52,552
There is one basket of gold...

44
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,558
...for the bride to wear.

45
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,060
Don't cry my pearl.

46
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:00,929
You are my dearest.

47
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,397
- Hello, Kalidasan Sir.
- Hello.

48
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:05,830
Where is Balakrishnan Sir?

49
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,766
He was here somewhere.

50
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,798
What's up? Got something?

51
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,466
Might get something.

52
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,509
Kalidasan hai.

53
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,472
What is this?

54
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,083
Little 'Appam'(Rice dish)

55
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,511
From that house

56
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,846
it's better to maintain
relationships with locals.

57
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,924
Wherever we go, there is a chance
to get samples from...

58
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,515
...nearby houses

59
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,886
- it's palm toddy.
- Is it?

60
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,190
Yes.

61
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,224
Where? Where is he?

62
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,733
The story of this ear ring might be a myth.

63
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,532
What do you say?

64
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:43,937
- Give me.
- Sir

65
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,276
it happened in 16th century.

66
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,319
When a snake had bitten Ibn Battutta,

67
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,982
...this man's ancestors had treated him.

68
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,155
That time, Battutta had given
this ear ring as a gift

69
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,555
Is what he is saying true?

70
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,134
Its Persian made.

71
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,964
Yes That's interesting.

72
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,536
Your salt has come out?

73
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,072
Grey hair increased, right?

74
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,532
What about Ibn Battutta?

75
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,008
Oh! Ear ring

76
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,279
if someone gets an opportunity,
they will even kill...

77
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,847
...him and take it

78
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,482
it's not possible to cut and take.

79
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,809
Not only that.

80
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,577
Sir, you please come.

81
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:28,879
This man...

82
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:29,818
Wait.

83
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,388
He knows how to make some forest dishes

84
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,548
I want to study that.

85
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:33,750
That's it

86
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,553
I was thinking that,
when did the archeologist...

87
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,665
...Kalathilparambil Kalidasan
become so dedicated.

88
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:41,824
One more thing

89
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,060
if it becomes problematic,
don't think that anyone in the...

90
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,297
...department will support you.

91
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,166
What are you doing?

92
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,740
Did you take the sketch of plot 3?

93
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,241
- I will take it now itself.
- What? - I will take it now itself.

94
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,174
When? After I die?
Hey, go and take.

95
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,336
Sir, lens.

96
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,380
Will you go only after getting this?

97
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,574
Go away.

98
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,009
- Hey Hey.
- Yes.

99
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,144
- Should I bring this there?
- No, Sir.

100
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,345
Hey, take and go.

101
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,280
You come.

102
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,120
Sir, why are you always scolding that boy?

103
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,091
Did you see the hair in his ears?

104
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,521
My father also had that.

105
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,926
Whenever I see him,
I would remember my father.

106
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,740
Sir, may I ask you something?

107
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,168
No.

108
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,775
You ask one or two question, man.

109
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,477
Mayiladi excavation project is good

110
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,543
it's an historical area.

111
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,652
We will get a result by digging that place.

112
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,117
What's the use of digging
this place which is 30 kilometers...

113
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,552
...away from that place?

114
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,894
All these we got from here.

115
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,793
Surprised?

116
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,225
Mohenjo-Daro model

117
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,133
Kali, you wait and see

118
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,396
I will win a Nobel prize with this project.

119
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,702
With the prize money, I will give you...

120
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,208
...and Babu a nice party, enough?

121
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,437
Okay then All the best.

122
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,671
May I go?

123
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:02,838
Okay.

124
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,074
Otherwise wait.

125
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,111
The team will come from Musiris

126
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,550
I am going I have some work.

127
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,481
- Okay.
- Convey my regards to Babu.

128
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:11,680
Are you coming to office today?

129
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:12,848
Let's meet there.

130
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,050
Oh!

131
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,924
I will forget I will forget everything.

132
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,860
Can you forget that small boy
who had given bangles to...

133
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:28,440
...that 10th standard girl without
others seeing, during the...

134
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,708
...Pooram festival in Kizhkavu temple?

135
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:37,339
The small boy can't forget
that big eyed girl whose eyes...

136
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,650
...were searching for someone in the temple.

137
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,218
Why are we like this?
What happened to us?

138
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,285
Cut Cut Cut.

139
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,287
What happened, Maya?

140
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,594
No Nothing, Sir.

141
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:55,825
What is the matter?

142
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,726
I felt it's a little too much

143
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,000
Maya, have you ever fallen in love?

144
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,700
If no?

145
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,243
That's the problem.

146
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,314
Love is always a little too much.

147
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,642
Okay

148
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,674
I just said.

149
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,047
No need to say again.

150
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,843
- Go back to take.
- Okay.

151
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,055
Why we are like this?

152
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,003
How much onion?

153
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,205
Brother Sasi.

154
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,745
Brother Sasi.

155
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,981
Write.

156
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,381
Coriander powder - 100g.

157
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,185
Chilly powder - 50g
Green chilly - 100g.

158
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,385
Onion - half kilo.

159
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:56,788
Two Radhas.

160
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,022
How is he standing after doing all these?

161
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,028
- Look at me!
- Oh my god!

162
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,797
My sister, this is for
the third time in this year.

163
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,629
You are grown up.

164
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,640
You have to take care of your
mother and other two girls...

165
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,936
...staying here, right?

166
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,905
I have told him
I will get bananas and come.

167
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,512
How come? He won't obey.

168
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,613
But nothing happened to the bananas.

169
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,975
Hey, I will thrash you.

170
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,278
What will I say my Jesus,
when George calls from...

171
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,480
...Philadelphia?

172
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,885
I will admit you in some boarding school.

173
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,926
First you lock that cycle and keep

174
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,929
I am not the first person in this world
who has fallen down from a cycle

175
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,121
I will thrash him today.

176
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,323
No, Maria Leave it.

177
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,900
My tension started
from the day he was born.

178
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,608
Today onwards there is no school,
no TV, no computer...

179
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,903
...nothing for you.

180
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,170
Attention please.

181
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:50,909
Now you eat something.

182
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,608
Let that boy take rest.

183
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:53,810
Right?

184
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,016
You people are cuddling
and making him like this

185
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,317
Maria, you can eat tasty food
because you got these two...

186
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,450
...girls as paying guests, right?

187
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,788
Have you made all these?

188
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,522
She doesn't know how to make tea.

189
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,256
Oh! I'm learning all that.

190
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,026
Tea

191
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:13,271
if you come inside,
then your beauty won't increase.

192
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,202
We can't say that,
what if it will increase?

193
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,700
Sit.

194
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,469
No Calorie is high in tea.

195
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:21,705
Oh!

196
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,748
Maria, leave it.

197
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,115
Hey, this year's quota is over.

198
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,884
Next change is in next year.

199
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,624
Get down.

200
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,301
- Babu.
- Yes.

201
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,534
This is our Moopan.

202
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,767
Come.

203
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,677
Something is there in the car Take it.

204
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,841
Why is your face looking dull?

205
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,513
Did your late father come back?

206
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,048
You take something for Moopan to eat.

207
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,262
You are happy, right?

208
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:13,757
Babu.

209
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:16,958
Hey.

210
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,366
What happen? Your eyes are wet

211
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,673
if anybody cuts onions,
their eyes will become wet.

212
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,871
Keep one piece of onion in the ear
Then the eyes won't become wet.

213
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:30,876
Then what is this?

214
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,377
What's the matter?

215
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,411
How many days got over
after you left from here?

216
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,112
Day before yesterday
I made fish curry with coccum...

217
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,247
...thinking that you will come.

218
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,689
Yesterday, I made country chicken curry

219
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,021
I made all these.

220
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,185
Then?

221
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,262
Then what happened?
I only ate everything.

222
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,055
For disappointing others.

223
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,657
Can't you buy at least
a mobile phone for contacting?

224
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,633
I was supposed to come
day before yesterday

225
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,237
I told you about Moopan, right?

226
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,635
He knows how to make some forest foods

227
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,238
if he once shows me how to make,
then I will make.

228
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:03,441
Aa ha! Very nice! Super
Vinegar is proper.

229
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,447
Correct proposition.

230
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,415
You have put salt after boiling, right?

231
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,417
Those all are my trade secrets
I won't tell you.

232
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,386
Aa ha! I also have a secret

233
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,615
I have brought liquor made in the forest.

234
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,487
You come to drink that I will give you.

235
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,028
That... Sir, what you said is true

236

Nothing, Koya.

300
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,135
Is it powder tea?

301
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,341
You are doing this work for almost
10-20 years, right? What tea is this?

Is it comedy?

304
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,605
This is the last comedy of this year.

305
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,649
Thus one year has got over

306
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,612
I can just say that I lived for 44 years.

307
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,215
You can also say that you died for44 years.

308
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,881
My elder daughter completed plus two.

309
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,424
That means you have to
conduct her marriage

310
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,529
I married early
So I can conduct her marriage while.

311
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,062
...I am healthy.

312
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,863

313
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,366

Happy new year.

318
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,274

00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,847
- Wife's biryani.

322
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,283

323
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,848
- Mujeeb.
- Yes.

324
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,116
Give me little tea.

325
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,850
There is no little tea

326
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,551
I will give you normal tea
like which I have given others.

327
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,821
May I go, sir?

328
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,432
Koya You go and pick

329
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,398
it might be to enquire about that Moopan.

330
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,768
Hey, don't you want to move those papers?

331
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,340
I will do it after a few days

332
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,271
I am having some work with him.

333
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,267
Sir, whether it would become a problem?

334
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,538
Nothing You don't worry.

335
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,311
Sir, what's your new year program?

336
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,542
Like all world Malayalis,
I too will drink liquor and stop...

337
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:42,950
...drinking That's all.

338
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,330
Your father had called me

339
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,031
it's good that you are searching for a job.

340
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,759
But don't create any problems for me

341
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,797
I don't need all these.

342
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,530
But I'm fed up of father.

343
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,607
Is this a new system?

344
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,739
It's having complaints.

345
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,870
Nice Very nice.

346
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,039
Are you coming from Bangalore?

347
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,250
- Yes Bangalore.
- Ernakulam via Trivandrum.

348
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:16,149
Hey Tell me

349
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,091
I have been to aunt
Meera's house in Eranakulam.

350
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,456
For the naming ceremony
of aunt's second child.

351
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,665
Mother had told me about your affair.

352
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,859
Hey, go man.

353
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,496
What's the name of the child?

354
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,797
Kalidasan

355
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,034
I was joking I think it's Abhishek.

356
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:40,743
How long are you going to stay here?

357
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,210
If I get a job,
I will permanently stay here

358
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,277
if no?

359
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,678
If I won't get a job...

360
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:49,947
I was joking.

361
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,355
Only this much

362
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:04,864
if that rascal who wore Raiban
had given one more chance for me...

363
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,595
Last time three sticks fell down.

364
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,137
This time only one.

365
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,707
There is improvement.

366
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:10,968
- Yes.
- Yes.

367
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,907
No need of taking this eight and all.

368
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,172
You just smile at that officer.

369
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,144
License will automatically come.

370
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,979
Oh! I haven't done that in my youth
Then how come now?

371
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,712
What's the problem now?

372
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,054
Sister, you have the face cut
of that old Miss India.

373
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,247
Right?

374
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,948
Old means? How old?

375
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,582
That... not like that...

376
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,191
Hey, listen, aunt Maria

377
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,263
I was beautiful.

378
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,935
When the first marriage proposal
came for me at...

379
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,437
...the age of 18...

380
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:46,973
Not one Two astrologers
confidently said that I'm manglik

381
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:52,308
if I get married, my husband
won't live more than that night.

382
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,411
That time itself, I was little arrogant.

383
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,622
That's enough for a girl's life
to get spoiled.

384
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,986
At last, a person came.

385
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,086
By saying he loves me a lot

386
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,623
I'm a girl, right?

387
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,028
I too fell in that.

388
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:14,429
When I told him about manglik,
he told me that knowingly...

389
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,836
...he didn't want to drink poison.

390
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,910
Now I won't see love in the eyes
which is looking at me now

391
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,879
I see only lust there.

392
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,290
But earlier I felt I was a singer.

393
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,187
But I was not.

394
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,866
Afterward I felt that I was a feminist

395
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,663
I was not that too.

396
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,733
Now I am feeling...

397
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,207
You are fit.

398
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,266
Babu, how many years
over after you came here?

399
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:17,796
Five years.

400
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:18,960
House?

401
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,265
Kottarakkara Kottarakkara.

402
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,402
How did you reach here?

403
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,908
I was there in the house of Menon sir
who works in SBI.

404
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,306
Hai green.

405
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:31,472
Then?

406
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:36,015
This Kalidasan sir had come
to see Menon sir's daughter.

407
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,451
Who? He?

408
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,420
Yes Our Kalidasan sir.

409
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,525
Balakrishnan sir was also there with him.

410
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,540
Kalidasan has two sisters only.

411
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:57,733
Earlier itself, Kalidasan's father died.

412
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,036
Five years ago his mother too.

413
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,407
That means no mother-in-law is there.

414
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:02,877
That is the highlight.

415
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,141
Take Eat.

416
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,805
Have you made this Unniyappan?

417
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,642
Yes.

418
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,745
Is it?

419
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,314
Not me Our cook.

420
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,449
Where is your kitchen?

421
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:47,884
There.

422
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:49,584
One minute.

423
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,284
Have you made Unniyappam?

424
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:24,921
Yes.

425
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,720
Are you from Kottarakkara?

426
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,025
Yes.

427
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:31,859
Are you coming? With me.

428
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,972
Sir, are you staying alone or with family?

429
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,467
After that I never sent sir
for seeing a bride.

430
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:25,984
Is it newly harvested rice?

431
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:31,357
Is it your shining beautiful smile?

432
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,293
Your beautiful smile.

433
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,557
Control.

434
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,931
Is it newly harvested rice?

435
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:43,497
Is it your shining beautiful smile?

436
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,211
What is going on here?

437
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,379
What happened?

438
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,218
Who is this?

439
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,519
That... Babu's father.

440
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,128
Why he is here?

441
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,489
That I will tell you.

442
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,221

This is perfume.

447
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:06,716
This is a mobile phone.

448
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,826
- Father has sent this.
- I don't need all these.

449
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,985
This will become a nuisance.

450
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,891
Ah! Maman, you don't consider as yours.

451
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,588

568
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:21,223
Maya Do you have a burger?

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,190
No, sir I have ordered for dosa.

570
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:26,558
Oh! Ls this dosa

Hello! Let's put the set of
Varikkaserrimana.

572
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,783
Come Come You must be tired.

573
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,112
You have made the interview flop, right?

574
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,880
Oh! If it goes, I will find another.

575
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,147
Yes Are you drinking?

576
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,018
Oh! This dirty rum
I don't want.

577
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,648
Why are you feeling
so disgusted about rum?

578
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,192
I don't feel disgusting.

579
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,299
Now it's been half an hour
since I ordered for a dosa

580
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,766
I'm calling again because I'm hungry

581
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,393

582
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,438
What will you do, I won't give?

583
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:13,833
Hey, check the number
and call Dirty fellow.

584
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,434
Are you teasing me?

585
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,671
Yes.

586
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:21,081
Any fellow can buy a phone to use like you.

587
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,881
Shut up You don't know who I am

588
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,580
I know who you are.

589
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,520
You are a dirty creature
with moustache and beard...

590
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,149
...who keeps boasting
yourself to be a man.

591
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,454
Don't play with me

592
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,858
if you play with me,
I will make you eat raw mango.

593
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:34,123
Do you want to see that?

594
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:38,793
A rascal like you will think
that you can make any girl eat raw mango.

595
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:42,464
You put that mango in salt
it can be served for your death feast.

596
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:43,631
Rascal.

597
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,004
Hey Stupid, your grandmother's feast.

598
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,371
You dog, go away.

599
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,241
You vampire, go away.

600
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,715
Hey Hey!
Keep the phone down, stupid.

601
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,577
What's the matter?
Who was on the phone?

602
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,622
An unlucky girl who called
on his phone thinking that it was a hotel.

603
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,134
Hey! Give this back
to your father itself.

604
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,465
When I won't be there,
you won't have any nuisance.

605
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,942
This... A girl has called me a dog
for the first time in my life.

606
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,839
You could have told her in the beginning
itself that it was a wrong number.

607
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,173
The problem is not
with this phone or that girl.

608
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,975
You don't know how to talk with ladies.

609
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,383
Yes I don't know

610
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,883
if you know that,
then you call her and say sorry.

611
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,716
Me? My dog will say.

612
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,124
Hello Dosa Don't you eat dosa.

613
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:38,283
Go away, you dog.

614
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,437
Ai! Banana in flat-bread flour?

615
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,640
It's for toasting, you buffalo.

616
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,109
Oh!

617
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,085
You check.

618
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,289
Someone is seriously saying sorry.

619
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,655
Who?

620
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:15,159
No name
Last number... 706.

621
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,700
Yes it might be that dosa rascal.

622
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,894
- I expected this.
- Oh!

623
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,527
The man who called you vampire, right?

624
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,004
May I write sorry and reply?

625
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,198
For what?

626
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,674
Mistake is there on our part too, right?

627
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,769
Hey These all are the permanent
tricks of people like him.

628
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,244
Firstly miss call.

629
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:32,610
Then sms

630
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,583
if we start talking with them,
then on the third day they will ask...

631
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:36,744
What?

632
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:40,821
Hello! Now which dress
have you worn, darling?

633
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,923
But I feel he is a decent man

634
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,189
it might be while sleeping.

635
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:49,391
No Because you have mistakenly called him.

636
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,066
Then why didn't he say that?

637
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,033
Otherwise itself,
whenever you call, you are one side.

638
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,729
You won't allow the other person to talk.

639
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,635
The same might have happened here too

640
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,636
if he calls and says something,
then you are able to deal...

641
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,506
...with that, right, sister?

642
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,612
He already said sorry, so...

643
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,486
Look That party.

644
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,886
- Who?
- Dosa Dosa.

645
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,422
She wants to talk with you

646
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,023
I don't want to talk

647
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,627
it happened because she was very hungry.

648
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:18,990
Leave it.

649
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:31,530
Hello it's me dosa.

650
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,367
Yesterday I wrongly called you Sorry.

651
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,374
Yesterday I was also a little drunk.

652
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,680
- Okay then.
- Okay.

653
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,447
- Hey.
- Yes.

654
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,288
Where is Thattilakutti dosa available?

655
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,465
Go man.

656
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,572

657
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:11,841

658
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,007

659
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,607
Yes Yes.

660
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,920
Sir, how come we never
came to know about this?

661
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,319
- Right?
- Yes.

662
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:23,253

Yes What happened?

665
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,034
Nothing I called you to say thanks.

666
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,297
For what?

667
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,270
I have eaten thattilakutti
dosa which you told me.

668
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,537
Very nice Thanks.

669
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,073
Garlic chutney was there or what?

670
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,475
That is the combination.

671
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,509
Yes.

672
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:46,143
What is your name?

673
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,178
Maya.

674
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:51,619
One more thing I am not a small girl.

675
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:54,883
What do you do?

676
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,352
I'm a dubbing artist.

677
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:01,054
- In movies?
- Yes.

678
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,190
Give money for fans association
to print flex - Okay.

679
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,857
- They just called me.
- Okay, sir.

680
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,060
Good morning, sir.

681
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,262
Take her number

682
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:11,096
I'm working in the archeology department.

683
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:17,036
Anyway dosa which started
the war has ended the war.

684
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:21,713
There was a cake which got
completed in second world war

685
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:23,479
it was made in four days.

686
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,111
Oh! Started history.

687
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,416
He will make it flop.

688
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:28,718
No Sir won't do anything like that.

689
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,189
We can make it in our house

690
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,659
I'm going to try it

691
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,093
if you are interested,
you can also join with me.

692
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:37,032
The name of this cake is Juvan's rainbow.

693
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,961
This recipe was made
by a French lady named Juvan Lobo...

694
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:44,533
...for her husband Albert
who had gone for war.

695
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:52,279
On the first day Juvan
made cake with strawberry.

696
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,052
War didn't end

697
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,752
Albert didn't come back
on the day which he promised.

698
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:41,320
For pistachio cake, add raisins
or dates soaked in rum for four hours.

699
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,129
See, I don't understand anything

700
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:49,403
it is good that if you add raisins
or dates which is...

701
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:54,568
...soaked in rum for four hours.

702
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,943
For that, rum.

703
00:46:58,549 --> 00:46:59,914
- Hey.
- Yes.

704
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:01,211
Rum.

705
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:31,280
On the next day Juvan made
a pistachio cake and waited for Albert.

706
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:32,848
Did he come on that day?

707
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:36,477
No She attached that
to the strawberry cake.

708
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,582
Don't make a person a fool like this.

709
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:06,609
What news?

710
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:09,343
- Maya, are you free now?
- Yes.

711
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,054
Then, Maya, see whether this voice...

712
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,381
Sir, you are not going?

713
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,016
No Koya, you go I will lock

714
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,352
I was telling here

715
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:21,022
Maya See whether
you can identify this voice.

716
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:22,389
Which voice?

717
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,660
Does that mean,
we allow a massacre to continue?

718
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:27,134
What happen first?

719
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:30,770
How many people were
killed according to your correspondent?

720
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:31,966
Did you recognize who is it?

721
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,167
No idea.

722
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:36,713
But... is it Sonia Gandhi?

723
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:38,606
Almost reached.

724
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,216
Mother in law lndira Gandhi.

725
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:41,442
Is it?

726
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:44,315
I am hearing lndira Gandhi's
voice for the first time.

727
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:48,248
Not that I just asked you
because you are from the sound field

728
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:51,052
I'm not so smart.

729
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:52,686
Now hear this.

730
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,524
One Chief Minister.

731
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,631
My dear Tamil children.

732
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,834
My dear Tamil children.

733
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,531
You all are my own children.

734
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:03,867
Do you have any idea?

735
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,202
MGR This is MGR.

736
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,368
Thalaivar(The leader)

737
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:09,703
How come you caught it so fast?

738
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:12,407
I have watched a lot of MGR movies

739
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:13,948
I am a MGR fan.

740
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:15,642
Is it?

741
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:18,344
My grandfather was in ADMK.

742
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,915
See.

743
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:24,983
See, I want to fly like
that bird in the sky.

744
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:29,664
See, I want to dance like that peacock...

745
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:31,631
...in the same sky.

746
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,293
In the same earth.

747
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:34,461
- Hey, see What is she doing?
- Ln the same sky.

748
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,004
In the same earth

749
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,404
I don't know She is washing the blouse

750
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,976
I want to sing the same song.

751
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,546
Third day of waiting.

752
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,807
Juvan had plucked
the orange from the orange tree...

753
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:51,944
...in front of the house
and made orange and waited.

754
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,429
But that day too, the war didn't end

755
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,639
Maya, how come
you got interested in cooking?

756
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,141
If you ask me like this.

757
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:17,076
My mother used to cook nicely

758
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,144
I studied from my mother.

759
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:21,477
Where is your mother now?

760
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,049
She is no more

761
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,048
it was a big incident.

762
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,155
There were around
16 people in my house at that time.

763
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,893
My mother had done household work alone

764
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,563
it's very interesting
to see my mother cooking.

765
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:38,097
Cutting and frying popadums.

766
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,498
Slicing bitter gourd.

767
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,102
Putting mango in salt.

768
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,499
After tasting, if she feels
it is okay, then she will hit the...

769
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,801
...pot with the spoon.

770
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:55,546
While cooking, I feel
I am bringing my mother back

771
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,785
I feel my mother is somewhere nearby me.

772
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:01,756
Mother's taste.

773
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:03,417
Smile Everything.

774
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:16,035
Ah! Don't cry Don't cry.

775
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,060
War ended.

776
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:52,197
After waiting for three days,
Albert had come with her chocolates.

777
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,804
She had melted and added
that above the cake which...

778
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,003
...she made for him.

779
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,706
They had eaten that cake together

780
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,377
Albert whispered in her ears.

781
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:37,449
You have ended one world war.

782
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:59,903
While loving, you and me
are like flowers falling in water.

783
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:06,379
Because of waves in some chariot...

784
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:13,283
...floats without knowing
day and night wandering.

785
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:30,136
Hey love...

786
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:38,374
You are fully sweet, then too.

787
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:47,250
Why uneasiness is increasing in the vein?

788
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:53,194
A feeling of elation.

789
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,163
With a petal of flower...

790
00:53:56,299 --> 00:54:00,292
The garden will make the moonlight.

791
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:03,406
Love will make togetherness.

792
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,242
While loving.

793
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:18,616
You and me...

794
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:22,624
...like flowers falling in water.

795
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:45,446
Hey heart...

796
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:49,947
...you are the barrier.

797
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:54,246
Why are you excited so much?

798
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:58,321
Like a butterfly...

799
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:06,296
...why should I fight to fall in fire?

800
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:11,898
Is it in the dust when the shadow goes...

801
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:14,772
...or is it in the dawn?

802
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:18,279
When we met for the first time...

803
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:35,024
While loving, you and
me are like flowers falling in water.

804
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,828
Because of waves in some chariot...

805
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:46,134
...floats without knowing day and night...

806
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,568
...wandering.

807
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:55,447
With the interference of central
committee in the problem...

808
00:55:55,585 --> 00:56:00,648
now there is no doubt that
Akaldal will fix their foot in Punjab.

809
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:03,123
Yes it's true.

810
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:10,724
What happened, sir?

811
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:14,827
Where have you kept that?

812
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:16,363
What?

813
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:19,066
That...

814
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,520
Do you want tea?

815
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,316
No Nothing.

816
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,195
She told me she wants to meet me.

817
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:55,102
Hey, take it off, you fool.

818
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,866
Aa! What?

819
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,232
She wants to meet me.

820
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,368
Who?

821
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:03,810
That... Maya.

822
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:05,139
Which Maya?

823
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:06,340
Your grandmother.

824
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:10,678
Oh! Our dosa
And you are not going?

825
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:13,779
No That won't be right.

826
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,454
Why so?

827
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:18,451
My look is not good.

828
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,318
What's the problem with this look?

829
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,628
That... With this beard and grey hair.

830
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:25,199
So what?

831
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:27,460
Sir, you are fair Right?

832
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:28,763
Leave it.

833
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:31,031
Have you seen superstar Rajinikant?

834
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,370
Not in look, style is important.

835
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:34,634
Yes.

836
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,745
How old is she?

837
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:41,044
May be 30 or 45?

838
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:43,444
Oh! Haven't you asked
all this while you talked to

839
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,076
...her all these times.

840
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,519
Her voice is nice.

841
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,821
Voice is nice.

842
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:55,129
Now you want to see how she looks.

843
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:59,464
For that you have to meet her directly

844
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:01,297
it won't be possible.

845
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,062
Now there is a relationship
between us, I don't want to

846
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,434
...destroy that.

847
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,135
Ah! What will we do now?

848
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:09,177
It's become a problem.

849
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,974
With my own experience,
I will tell you one idea.

850
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,868
Your cappuccino.

851
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:48,783
Ayyappan, Kuyyappan.

852
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,311
Big thief, thief.

853
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:54,784

Come.

868
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:56,012

Almost 100

870
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,416
I am working in the archeology department.

...- keep them in museums
after cleaning it.

873
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:11,790
Then public can see that by taking tickets.

874
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:15,768
Here in the museum,
a ticket cost is Rs 15, right?

- I don't know.
- Yes

876
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:21,373

I have acted in one movie too.

878
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,439

Then?

909
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:35,703
She is not your type.

910
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:37,737
That means... she is short.

911
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:40,181

01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:47,318
Almost 5.5ft tall.

915
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,481
He looks like your younger brother, sister.

916
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:51,320
Is he black in color?

917
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:52,621
Medium.

918
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:53,820
But he is smart.

919
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:56,925
He is smart in seducing girls

920
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,363
if both of you walk together,
you people seem to be father...

921
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:04,632
...and daughter.

922
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:05,899
People won't say that.

923
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,202
She is very fair.

924
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:09,237
Then what about Rajinikant?

925
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,869
That is make-up.

926
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,208
Then graphics too.

927
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:13,642
Movie is not life, right?

928
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:15,774
You only told me that he is genuine.

929
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,216
No Not like that.

930
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,451
But I didn't expect this much

931
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,523
if you ask me whether
he will suit you, sister

932
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,283
if it is just for flirting, then okay.

933
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:24,416
Nice.

934
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:25,686
Oh! Hey, go away.

935
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:30,823
But her voice through phone
has good maturity.

936
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,295
She might be looking young.

937
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:34,903
Nothing like that.

938
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,968
We can't trust the relations through phone.

939
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:41,499
Then... I am having
a doubt if she is a fraud.

940
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,176
Anyway it's good that I haven't gone.

941
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:48,149
As per your character, it's good Very good.

942
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:50,344
One more thing
That day she called you da, right?

943
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:51,783
I didn't forget that.

944
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:52,980
Me too.

945
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:54,454
- Yes.
- Yes.

946
01:04:58,127 --> 01:04:59,219
Leave it.

947
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,384
Yes

948
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,531
if she calls again, you inform me
I will deal with her.

949
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,669
What's there to eat today?

950
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:13,900
I don't know.

951
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,302
Let me see.

952
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,943
Hey Should I call?

953
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:31,478
Not for me if you want, you can call.

954
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,134
Sister, phone

955
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:57,973
I know it's him.

956
01:06:58,147 --> 01:06:59,671
He is excited by seeing you.

957
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:02,446
That is why he is calling at night.

958
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:22,402
Why are you laughing?

959
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,019
Yes What happened man?

960
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,555
No nothing.

961
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,558
Then you sleep.

962
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,964
Sir, how is your program going on?

963
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,164
What happened, Kalidasan?

964
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:00,833
Did you meet her?

965
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:04,670
Not that.

966
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,674
You come here.

967
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,145
Some work is here Come.

968
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:07,709
We should stand up and listen to that call.

969
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,195
Why are you here?

970
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:36,736
For an interview, man.

971
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:38,531
What is the package?

972
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:39,966
I haven't got a job yet.

973
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:42,043
Oh! So sorry for you man

974
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:44,476
I'm charging per hour remuneration here.

975
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,844
- Did you get all the papers?
- Yes.

976
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:48,075
One more is there to get.

977
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,242
Only one?

978
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:50,778
Two Only that much.

979
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,012
How are you?

980
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:54,314
Your marriage is over?

981
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:56,323
Force is there in family.

982
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,392
- Your father?
- No, me.

983
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,963
Do you have any problem,
if I come here to meet you?

984
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:04,464
No You should come

985
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:06,000
I'm having two new theories.

986
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:07,432
You should hear that.

987
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,774
Okay bye Let me go I am in a hurry.

988
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,273

01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:28,579
Okay Bye.

992
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,454
Sir, are you sitting here
reading newspaper?

993
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:43,629
Sudhakaran.

994
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,673
- Alphonse.
- I'm Vishwan.

995
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:49,411
- We are from human rights welfare.
- Okay.

996
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:52,609
Is it you who kidnapped Moopan?

997
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:54,807
I didn't get you.

998
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:57,279
Leave it, sir.

999
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:00,647
We came here after
knowing that Moopan is here.

1000
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,157
What do you want?

1001
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:10,221
You should send Moopan along with us.

1002
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:11,660
We should take care of him

1003
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:13,192
it's not possible.

1004
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:15,167
You go away without wasting time Go.

1005
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:17,838
You didn't understand
the seriousness of this matter.

1006
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,033
A person like Moopan,
from his living culture...

1007
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:21,439
No Alphonse.

1008
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:24,704
Sir, I have joined human
rights welfare mission after...

1009
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,940
...resigning from my job
in the police department.

1010
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:29,442
You are playing this drama
for that ear ring, right?

1011
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:32,086
I know how to deal with this.

1012
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:35,121
You know how to deal, right?

1013
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:37,350
Then go away from here
without wasting time.

1014
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,656
That means sir won't accept
direct dealing, right?

1015
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:44,358
No.

1016
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,531
Hey This is a man missing case.

1017
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:53,937
- You will suffer because of this.
- Okay

1018
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,872
I will dismiss you from this job
Understand?

1019
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:58,271
Get out.

1020
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:00,374
Hey, come.

1021
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:23,171
- Hai.
- What is this, Maya?

1022
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:24,599
Only two flat-breads?

1023
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:26,197
Now you have to dub voice
for Vani Viswanath, right?

1024
01:12:29,211 --> 01:12:30,269
Ls beef fry there?

1025
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:32,305
It got over, sir May I take roast for you?

1026
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:35,016
Beef fry got over? Oh!

1027
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,676
Roast? Then you
take two plates of roast.

1028
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:42,715
What is the matter, Maya?

1029
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:44,322
You are looking mood off.

1030
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:45,887
No Nothing, sir.

1031
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:47,287
Ai! Not that

1032
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:49,688
Maya has some problem.

1033
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:53,359
For me too, Maya

1034
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:55,060
I'm also depressed

1035
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:59,032
Maya You know about
my affair with Lavanya, right?

1036
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:04,344
She had run away
with her make-up man.

1037
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,075
She never tried to understand me

1038
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:09,144
I realized that very late.

1039
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:13,344
There is nothing to do with beauty.

1040
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:17,982
Only a technician can understand
another technician's heart

1041
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:21,686
Maya, can you see my heart?

1042
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,865
We can console each other

1043
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,194
it is possible for us, Maya

1044
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:33,798
I'm having one ginger estate in Waynad.

1045
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:36,442
Nice climate

1046
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:40,637
if it is not for long term,
then at least for short term.

1047
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:42,879
At least few hours.

1048
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:45,845
Togetherness.

1049
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:51,518
What is this, Maya? Ai!

1050
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:53,052
What are you doing?

1051
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:02,865
Rice soup is best.

1052
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:11,010
Jai Hanumanu Hare.

1053
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,647
No one should expect
anymore onion in the salad.

1054
01:14:16,518 --> 01:14:18,577
Sir, why are you sitting so emotionally?

1055
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:23,757
If she is having the age of
Aswathykutty, then her age...

1056
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:25,793
...is maximum 20 years

1057
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,623
I have become old.

1058
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:31,562
So what? Our Salman Rushdie
has married Padmalakshmi...

1059
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:33,760
...who is too young
Do you know that?

1060
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:39,336
Hey Sir, you wait she will call you.

1061
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,242
Sir, why have you come here
with these people?

1062
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:53,010
- I was forced to come.
- I have called sir.

1063
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,851
This problem may even
affect subordinates like me.

1064
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:57,952
Sir, you know everything, right?

1065
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,493
That's why I came here

1066
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:01,586
I can understand what you say.

1067
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,392
But law won't allow that.

1068
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,966
This is not like how you brought Babu.

1069
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:07,296
Case is man missing.

1070
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:08,901
Besides that he is a tribal.

1071
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,797
Tell him that we know other options too.

1072
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:15,243
You keep quite I will speak.

1073
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:17,942
Hey man, you let him go with them.

1074
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:19,536
Sir, why are you talking like this?

1075
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:21,582
Don't believe these people
Their plan is something else.

1076
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,613
Oh ho! What's your plan?

1077
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,786
Why are you keeping him here?

1078
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:29,188
Kalidasan, you try to understand
what I'm saying.

1079
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:31,286
Let Moopan go with them now.

1080
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,357
We can arrange basic protection for him.

1081
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:42,402
Hey Are you listening
to what I'm speaking?

1082
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:44,597
What did you say?

1083
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:52,180
Welcome to the selection of
special five people.

1084
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:54,579
With that special five people you can...

1085
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:56,942
Sir, who is he?

1086
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:59,851
I have seen lots of archeological rascals

1087
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:03,558
if I thrash him nicely,
he will cry and allow me to take Moopan.

1088
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:05,221
Rascal.

1089
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:12,160
- What is this? - Kalidasan.
- Then you thrash me?

1090
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,800
- What are you doing?
- Thrash me.

1091
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:16,263
Why are you staring at me, you pig?

1092
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,972
You will thrash a policeman, you rascal?

1093
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:20,234
Want more?

1094
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:21,866
What's the matter, you pig?
Go away.

1095
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:25,679
- Sudhakaran! Listen to me.
- I will show you archeological rascals.

1096
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:27,006
Then come Come and show me.

1097
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:28,047
- You rascal.
- Hey, come here Come.

1098
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:29,309
Stop it.

1099
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,147
When did you become so cheap?

1100
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:34,254
Don't forget that he is having
a family and you block him...

1101
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:35,789
...here for making food for you.

1102
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:38,292
His grandchildren also came

1103
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:40,523
if you can't understand that,
then what man are you?

1104
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:42,622
You take Moopan and go

1105
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:45,994
if you want to beat someone, then beat me.

1106
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,193
Hey, beat me.

1107
01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:03,480
This issue.

1108
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:55,329
Oh! Phone in program?

1109
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:59,039
That... How many times have
I told you don't put a wet towel...

1110
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:00,199
...on the bed after taking a bath?

1111
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:01,741
Sister, you never told me that.

1112
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:04,808
The entire floor is
full of your hair, you know that.

1113
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:08,542
You hair is falling, right, sister?

1114
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:12,111
Sister Sister.

1115
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:13,847
Please make maggi for me.

1116
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:15,752
Please, sister Please.

1117
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:18,623
Your mother is there, right?

1118
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:20,319
If she finished her work,
then go and tell her to make.

1119
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:22,124
- Go away.
- You come.

1120
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:24,232
She came back after dubbing
some family serial.

1121
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,856
- I will make for you Okay?
- Okay.

1122
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:39,539
- Aunt.
- Yes - I'm going.

1123
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:40,740
Okay.

1124
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:49,755
Enough, sister
Somebody will have a bad eye on you.

1125
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,391
Let it be That's good.

1126
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:53,285
- Bye, aunt.
- Bye.

1127
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:54,887
May I go?

1128
01:18:56,932 --> 01:18:58,456
- Meenakshi is beautiful, right?
- Yes.

1129
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:02,333
Why are you like this, Maya?

1130
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:05,073
In between, you became a little smart.

1131
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,602
Now again you became a monkey.

1132
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:11,211
Don't stare at me I just said what I felt.

1133
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:13,008
You leave it Let it be anything.

1134
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:14,377
You will say like that only

1135
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:17,781
if she marries someone,
then nobody will be there to cook.

1136
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:23,351
- Oh! My dear Maria.
- I am sorry.

1137
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,084
You don't listen what she is saying.

1138
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:29,122
Your age is going.

1139
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:32,064
At your age, I had four children.

1140
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:34,831
You are not getting a groom,
because you are not taking...

1141
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:35,994
...care of your beauty.

1142
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:39,164
Okay I don't want a groom.

1143
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:41,807
What is the problem, if I live alone?

1144
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:44,443
After sometime, you will face trouble.

1145
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:45,976
Look this side.

1146
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:48,112
Then what should I do?

1147
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:50,514
Should I walk through
the road saying someone should...

1148
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:51,778
...marry me, marry me.

1149
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:53,920
Everybody can give advice.

1150
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,548
Hey, aunt Maria.

1151
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:57,591
Do you have any problem, if I stay here?

1152
01:19:57,926 --> 01:19:59,052
Hey, what is this?

1153
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:00,989
I also don't understand what this is

1154
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:02,654
I am fed up of this dirty life

1155
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:24,914
Maria I'm going

1156
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:33,523
I was supposed to ask you
in the beginning itself.

1157
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:35,891
Why are you catching a book like this?

1158
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:37,055
Why don't you keep it in the bag?

1159
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:40,124
Mother had trained me
to catch books like this when...

1160
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:41,394
...I passed 8th standard.

1161
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:43,000
Then it became a habit.

1162
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:45,531
Why so?

1163
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:49,101
Nothing.

1164
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,047
Why did your mother tell you like that?

1165
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,139
My mother didn't tell me like that.

1166
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,361
Ah! You please help me.

1167
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:08,654
Catch this.

1168
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:12,356
Catch Catch.

1169
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:16,436
Let me see Otherwise I...

1170
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:44,859
Sit here.

1171
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:46,893
Nothing Nothing.

1172
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:48,593
Nothing.

1173
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:50,597
Ah! Blood

1174
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,564
I will call an ambulance
Sorry, auto rickshaw.

1175
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,005
Ai! No No.

1176
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:48,255
- What happened?
- Accident.

1177
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:50,159
- Keep her in that bed.
- No I slipped down.

1178
01:22:57,872 --> 01:22:59,271
Doctor ls blood needed, Doctor?

1179
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:00,466
You go and wait outside.

1180
01:23:00,575 --> 01:23:03,635
Sister, you take the scissor
and cut the cloth in this area.

1181
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:05,644
Doctor, ls surgery needed?

1182
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:07,806
- I will sign paper for that.
- Hey, I told you to wait outside.

1183
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:13,316
- Hey, go and buy a dress
for her to change - Okay.

1184
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:14,945
Change your dress also.

1185
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:23,889
What do you want?

1186
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:29,397
I need... not this much...

1187
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:32,769
All dresses are needed
for a 24 year old girl to wear.

1188
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:34,239
Is she standing without cloth?

1189
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:36,603
Yes She is just born.

1190
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:38,212
- Take.
- Okay.

1191
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:41,440
Be careful.

1192
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:46,545
Get in.

1193
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:53,226
- My...
- Hey come

1194
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:55,556
if you are busy, you go.

1195
01:24:06,741 --> 01:24:07,799
Manu Hey come

1196
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:10,002
I am coming, you dog.

1197
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:16,270
Love is a burning like feeling
which was formed by spine.

1198
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:24,946
While it pains, love is enjoyable.

1199
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:30,917
You in me and me in you.

1200
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,184
Slowly.

1201
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:34,022
Slowly.

1202
01:25:34,162 --> 01:25:38,292
Dissolve by melting the border.

1203
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:01,785
If you are away from me...

1204
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:06,753
...always you will remember me

1205
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:11,259
I will come to you...

1206
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:15,731
...and wait to see the moonlight.

1207
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:20,103
Separation...

1208
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:30,209
Separation, if you are there,
love will spread.

1209
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:35,920
In the blood like a fire...

1210
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:43,591
...love is a burning like feeling
which was formed by spine

1211
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:12,053
...like the jasmine which grows
only by wetting with water.

1212
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:20,695
Love is the autumn
which gives coolness to the eye.

1213
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:24,470
Sorrow...

1214
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:36,912
Sorrow, if you won't be there,
then love will become tired.

1215
01:27:37,285 --> 01:27:42,723
Just like a waste wind...

1216
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:50,291
...love is a burning like feeling
which was formed by spine.

1217
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:58,799
While it pains, love is enjoyable.

1218
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:04,906
You in me and me in you.

1219
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:06,205
Slowly.

1220
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:08,181
Slowly.

1221
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:12,616
Dissolve by melting the border.

1222
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:36,169
Hey Manu came?

1223
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:38,370
No, sir.

1224
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:40,174
- Sir, may I take food?
- Yes.

1225
01:28:56,731 --> 01:29:00,565
Like you said, I made nice fish curry.

1226
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:08,199
Salt is not there

1227
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:11,869
it's there.

1228
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:13,478
Should I eat your waste?

1229
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:16,875
What is this, sir?

1230
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:18,417
Should I eat your waste?

1231
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:24,216
What do you think,
I will eat anything which you make?

1232
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:26,183
I'm giving you monthly salary, right?

1233
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:28,155
You go and study how to make good food.

1234
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:29,320
Go.

1235
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:32,229
Sir, you don't say that
I don't know how to cook.

1236
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:34,624
What will you do,
if I say that? Beat me?

1237
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:37,266
Then beat me beat me

1238
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:38,864
if you drink liquor,
then keep it in your stomach itself

1239
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:40,099
I will sleep wherever I like.

1240
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:41,333
Who are you to question me?

1241
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:44,275
Servant should stand in his own place.

1242
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:45,471
You don't come to advice me

1243
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:47,675
I don't need anyone here.

1244
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:50,008
Kalidasan is alone from the age of 14.

1245
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:52,184
Now also, I want to be like that
I don't want anyone.

1246
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:43,397
Aa! Woke up!

1247
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:46,064
When did you come?

1248
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:48,138
I knew that you were fit.

1249
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:50,375
That's why I thought to let you sleep well.

1250
01:30:55,149 --> 01:30:56,275
Nothing is here.

1251
01:30:58,386 --> 01:30:59,478
- Sir.
- Yes.

1252
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:04,020
- Hey, don't take all samples.
- Okay

1253
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:05,585
I have kept for someone aside.

1254
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,018
- Take that only.
- Okay.

1255
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:08,688
- Okay Go.
- Yes, sir

1256
01:31:09,697 --> 01:31:11,892
I told you there won't be anything.

1257
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:13,692
Do you want tea?

1258
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:17,098
It's very nice to have tea
in the morning after drinking...

1259
01:31:17,205 --> 01:31:19,002
...liquor in the night.

1260
01:31:19,507 --> 01:31:20,565
You come.

1261
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:27,275
What did you say?
There won't be anything, right?

1262
01:31:28,082 --> 01:31:29,276
That's true Nothing is here.

1263
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:33,851
Hey, I who is doing this work
for almost 25 years, knew...

1264
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:36,082
...before itself that nothing is here.

1265
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:37,282
This is only red mud.

1266
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:39,317
Yes

1267
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:42,987
it's not for making you bored

1268
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:44,925
I wanted to tell this to you

1269
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:49,663
it's a story which took place
almost 30 years back.

1270
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:53,200
Balakrishnan who went to
Madras city to study history...

1271
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:56,871
...had gone to the nearby shop
to buy cigarette.

1272
01:31:57,111 --> 01:31:58,601
That time I had seen Padmini
for the first time.

1273
01:32:02,617 --> 01:32:03,709
Love at first sight.

1274
01:32:07,288 --> 01:32:09,051
What happened? Can't I fall in love?

1275
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:13,251
- Then?
- Then what is there to happen?

1276
01:32:13,628 --> 01:32:17,359
Like other lovers, we also
loved each other for five years.

1277
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:20,397
Marriage Children Grandchildren.

1278
01:32:20,501 --> 01:32:22,162
We had dreamt about the entire life.

1279
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:24,696
But my father's Chezhipodakaran family...

1280
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:27,035
...members were not satisfied
with her family background.

1281
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:31,371
Thus I became like this

1282
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:34,775
I'm writing someone's story
after digging and collecting...

1283
01:32:34,916 --> 01:32:38,784
...the utensils and bottles
which foreigners had abandoned here.

1284
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:42,913
Without the knowledge of anyone,
Balakrishnan's story...

1285
01:32:43,357 --> 01:32:44,415
...was buried.

1286
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:46,724
Here... here.

1287
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:49,886
Now where is she?

1288
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:52,590
How is the tea? She made this.

1289
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:58,362
Where? Here?

1290
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:02,103
See that house She is staying there.

1291
01:33:03,277 --> 01:33:05,575
With her son Her husband had died.

1292
01:33:05,947 --> 01:33:08,745
For seeing her, I have made
the department a fool by saying...

1293
01:33:08,883 --> 01:33:11,317
...some ancient things are here
and came here with the unit.

1294
01:33:11,953 --> 01:33:13,750
That time I took advice
from several people.

1295
01:33:14,021 --> 01:33:16,615
But everybody dissuaded me
by saying about money and career

1296
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:18,989
I hadn't asked myself

1297
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:23,023
if I had called her,
she would have come with me.

1298
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:32,036
May I go, Kalattilparambil Kalidasan?

1299
01:33:33,674 --> 01:33:34,800
Sir, where are you going now?

1300
01:33:35,643 --> 01:33:38,635
Now her son Varun is
transferred to Kasargode.

1301
01:33:39,246 --> 01:33:41,271
Let me see whether there is some history.

1302
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:44,780
Hey man You should understand one thing.

1303
01:33:45,319 --> 01:33:46,911
Your problem is not about that Moopan

1304
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:48,113
it's because you don't have a pair.

1305
01:33:48,923 --> 01:33:50,151
Keep your complex aside.

1306
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:52,786
You are a very sweet man.

1307
01:33:53,527 --> 01:33:55,461
Call her.

1308
01:34:42,109 --> 01:34:47,445
Why are you late...

1309
01:34:47,715 --> 01:34:53,745
...at least when you reach here...

1310
01:35:04,765 --> 01:35:11,534
I will keep one room without opening...

1311
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:18,141
...that too in my garden.

1312
01:35:18,746 --> 01:35:25,151
- Very nice! - I will keep
one room without opening...

1313
01:35:25,586 --> 01:35:31,718
...that too in my garden...

1314
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:36,021
...by dreaming.

1315
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:06,617
I... I was a little busy.

1316
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:10,188
That's why...

1317
01:36:10,898 --> 01:36:12,195
I didn't call you

1318
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:13,899
I wish to meet you to say something.

1319
01:36:15,936 --> 01:36:17,028
Me too.

1320
01:36:20,908 --> 01:36:23,138
Ah! Not there.

1321
01:36:23,644 --> 01:36:25,441

1322
01:36:28,048 --> 01:36:30,278
Okay I will meet you there.

1323
01:36:31,685 --> 01:36:32,777
Okay.

1324
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:53,369
He called me.

1325
01:36:54,241 --> 01:36:56,038
He wants to meet me.

1326
01:36:56,177 --> 01:36:58,145
So what? I will go.

1327
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:05,077
No I will go

1328
01:37:07,288 --> 01:37:09,688
I can't carry this headache.

1329
01:37:11,692 --> 01:37:15,025
Whatever happens, I want to
meet and tell him the truth

1330
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:19,730
I want peace of mind.

1331
01:37:51,265 --> 01:37:52,732
Sir, just a second.

1332
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:00,306

1333
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:08,309

1334
01:38:09,316 --> 01:38:10,374
Chili?

1335
01:38:12,753 --> 01:38:13,811
Sorry man.

1336
01:38:14,154 --> 01:38:16,452
You are in the second place
after king Nalan.

1337
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:17,648
Who is that?

1338
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:21,659
That... our Manu's father.

1339
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:25,357
Where you have gone?

1340
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:27,926
Hey, I called her.

1341
01:38:28,335 --> 01:38:29,802
She agreed to meet me today.

1342
01:38:30,304 --> 01:38:31,703
Now no use of hiding.

1343
01:38:32,406 --> 01:38:33,566
Who? Maya?

1344
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:35,572
Yes Your dosa.

1345
01:38:36,777 --> 01:38:37,801
Did you tell her everything?

1346
01:38:37,945 --> 01:38:39,071
That I will tell her directly.

1347
01:38:39,246 --> 01:38:40,304
You come fast.

1348
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:00,866
Wow! Awesome man.

1349
01:39:03,737 --> 01:39:06,968
She agreed to see thinking that's me.

1350
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:10,775
His happiness.

1351
01:39:11,445 --> 01:39:13,436
Have you ever seen my uncle?

1352
01:39:13,547 --> 01:39:14,605
No.

1353
01:39:14,882 --> 01:39:19,148
You should see
His face is like mashed jack fruit

1354
01:39:19,753 --> 01:39:21,687
if he marries her.

1355
01:39:21,822 --> 01:39:24,450
Then you have to call her aunt.

1356
01:39:24,658 --> 01:39:27,889
Ah! I can't even think about that.

1357
01:39:27,995 --> 01:39:29,656
Hey Hey Shirt will fall down.

1358
01:39:29,763 --> 01:39:30,821
Go man.

1359
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:32,831
Here my life is going to fall down

1360
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:35,765
I have met her before they spoke on phone

1361
01:39:35,936 --> 01:39:37,927
if she meets him,
then she won't tolerate that.

1362
01:39:38,038 --> 01:39:39,096
Then what's the problem.

1363
01:39:39,206 --> 01:39:40,264
Let them meet

1364
01:39:40,841 --> 01:39:42,240
I can't trust him.

1365
01:39:42,376 --> 01:39:44,640
He is black in color,
but his voice is very nice.

1366
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:46,871
He will seduce her.

1367
01:39:47,314 --> 01:39:48,713
She is a pool girl.

1368
01:39:48,849 --> 01:39:49,907
Skirt?

1369
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:51,974
You don't say any third rate comedy.

1370
01:39:52,119 --> 01:39:53,143
Hey, Manu.

1371
01:39:53,387 --> 01:39:55,719
You carefully listen to what I am saying

1372
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:57,085
I know you very well.

1373
01:39:57,191 --> 01:39:58,556
You don't wait anymore.

1374
01:39:58,726 --> 01:40:00,421
You go away from here.

1375
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:06,959
No No No I know
how to handle this situation

1376
01:40:07,067 --> 01:40:08,659
I will tell him to mind his business.

1377
01:40:08,769 --> 01:40:10,168
She is mine.

1378
01:40:11,705 --> 01:40:14,674
You will destroy people by advising them.

1379
01:40:14,808 --> 01:40:16,070
You dog Rascal.

1380
01:40:33,293 --> 01:40:34,624
Oh! You came

1381
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:41,832
I called her I decided to meet her.

1382
01:40:43,604 --> 01:40:44,901
Only once.

1383
01:40:45,506 --> 01:40:47,064
Then if she wants, let her go.

1384
01:40:47,674 --> 01:40:48,698
Right?

1385
01:40:49,109 --> 01:40:50,201
I want to go.

1386
01:40:50,944 --> 01:40:52,502
Going? Where?

1387
01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:55,181
I'm having one interview in Bangalore

1388
01:40:55,282 --> 01:40:56,544
I have to leave now,
then only I can reach there in the morning.

1389
01:40:56,683 --> 01:40:57,775
Today where do you want to go?

1390
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:58,977
You won't get bus and train.

1391
01:40:59,086 --> 01:41:00,951
Train is there
I will travel in general compartment.

1392
01:41:01,522 --> 01:41:02,750
What happened to you?

1393
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:03,914
Only for one day.

1394
01:41:04,024 --> 01:41:05,116
We will make everything okay.

1395
01:41:05,225 --> 01:41:07,022
Nothing I want to go immediately.

1396
01:41:07,861 --> 01:41:11,991
Manu, within three hours
just after you came here, police caught me

1397
01:41:12,199 --> 01:41:15,066
I have started talking with a girl
for the first time in my life.

1398
01:41:15,636 --> 01:41:18,230
After you came here,
my life which was getting spoiled...

1399
01:41:18,539 --> 01:41:20,905
...by eating and drinking
had started changing

1400
01:41:23,377 --> 01:41:25,072
if you go now, then what will I do?

1401
01:41:25,212 --> 01:41:26,804
If you want, we can change the brand.

1402
01:41:27,214 --> 01:41:29,205
For me, my career is important for me

1403
01:41:29,316 --> 01:41:30,408
I have to go.

1404
01:41:30,884 --> 01:41:33,944
Oh! If he wants to go,
let him go, sir.

1405
01:41:34,154 --> 01:41:35,348
Don't block him.

1406
01:41:37,057 --> 01:41:38,922
Okay I will drop you.

1407
01:41:39,326 --> 01:41:40,850
No I will go alone.

1408
01:41:40,994 --> 01:41:42,256
My friend is coming with me

1409
01:41:42,362 --> 01:41:44,956
if I brought you here,
then I can drop you also.

1410
01:41:45,065 --> 01:41:46,191

I have to go home urgently.

1425
01:42:46,693 --> 01:42:47,751

1426
01:42:48,529 --> 01:42:49,587

Then come.

1432
01:43:05,812 --> 01:43:06,870
Hey.

1433
01:43:27,367 --> 01:43:28,891
Why didn't you pick your phone?

1434
01:43:29,503 --> 01:43:30,527
Slowly!

1435
01:43:34,274 --> 01:43:35,434
Who are these people?

1436
01:43:35,943 --> 01:43:37,376
Who is this bearded man?

1437
01:43:39,379 --> 01:43:40,437
Who is she?

1438
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:43,107
Keep quite.

1439
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:45,013
Let's talk after getting out
of the vehicle.

1440
01:43:54,628 --> 01:43:59,190
In this moment...

1441
01:44:00,801 --> 01:44:05,636
In this last scene...

1442
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:10,967
Without knowing...

1443
01:44:16,283 --> 01:44:17,773
Why are you going home now?

1444
01:44:17,884 --> 01:44:18,942
My mother called me

1445
01:44:19,052 --> 01:44:20,349
I will call your mother.

1446
01:44:20,454 --> 01:44:21,512
No.

1447

Maya or Meenakshi?

1486
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:13,466
What do you think?
I am a fool?

1487
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:16,709
I only heard about showing
younger sister and...

1488
01:50:16,843 --> 01:50:18,310
...conducting elder sister's marriage

1489
01:50:19,412 --> 01:50:21,778
Maya which I know was very genuine.

1490
01:50:22,782 --> 01:50:24,875
Is this movie, for you to make
others a fool by giving your...

1491
01:50:24,985 --> 01:50:26,179
...voice for another person?

1492
01:50:27,087 --> 01:50:28,418
I want to tell you something.

1493
01:50:28,555 --> 01:50:29,579
Don't say anything.

1494
01:50:29,689 --> 01:50:31,020
This is not the time for that.

1495
01:50:31,191 --> 01:50:32,920
That drama has ended here.

1496
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,160
That... I have come here
to meet you and tell you...

1497
01:50:36,262 --> 01:50:38,560

1498
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:39,756

1499
01:50:40,367 --> 01:50:42,392
I don't want to see you now.

1500
01:50:46,473 --> 01:50:50,102

before I have met you.

1501
01:50:54,514 --> 01:50:55,572

1502
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:07,888

01:51:17,737 --> 01:51:18,965
The person sitting next to him.

1505
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:31,947
Almost 900/0 people in this
world have the same problem...

1506
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:35,150
...which you have, Maya.

1507
01:51:35,822 --> 01:51:38,313
One person among them is
you and the other one is me.

1508
01:51:40,126 --> 01:51:44,961
Our great mistake was that
we had created a substitute

1509
01:51:45,098 --> 01:51:45,689
between us.

1510
01:51:49,402 --> 01:51:53,862

museum for going back to history.

A smart lie.

1516
01:53:45,752 --> 01:53:48,653

which a dosa created...

1517
01:53:48,755 --> 01:53:50,086
