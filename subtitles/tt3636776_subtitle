1
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,229
Hello. - Sir, it's time.

2
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,058
What? - For Dinner.

3
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,531
Shall I serve it?
- No. I am not hungry.

4
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,533
Sir, are you.. - I am okay.

5
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,366
You go sleep. - Yes.

6
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,453
Sleep peacefully if you want!

7
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,427
Because I am awake!

8
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,197
No matter how hard sensations
try to spear through the silence,

9
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,460
We won't let you scream...

10
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:21,995
We have a sharp eye
on every news every hour.

11
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:25,066
Right now,
a killer is roaming this city..

12
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,379
"who looks sober,
but is ruthless by nature.

13
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:32,315
He might be advancing towards
your house in a red car.

14
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:33,977
He enters the house"

15
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,384
..when the owner of the house exits.

16
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,453
Chakradhar, sir!

17
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,587
Feels like you simply jumped
out of the television.

18
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,585
Do you really not sleep?
- That's the point.

19
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,588
I stay awake even when I am sleeping.

20
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,529
Where's Samrat? - I don't know.

21
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,129
After 11V; cups of
coffee and 1V2 cigarette..

22
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,536
..and he suddenly left.

23
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,974
He's been murmuring
'Fed up Fed up' since morning.

24
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,506
Fed up!

25
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,313
Oh...that's the point.

26
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,544
Now I know where he is and why?

27
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,556
Christa!

28
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,421
Christa!

29
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,293
Christa!

30
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:25,560
Christa!

31
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,566
Christa!

32
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,568
Christa!

33
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,377
Christa!

34
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,577
Christa!

35
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,075
Fight.

36
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,510
Come on, come on, hit me.

37
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,378
Move aside.

38
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,513
Move aside.

39
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,149
Move, move.

40
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,893
100 for 10.

41
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:52,930
Stop all this. - 100 for 10.

42
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,021
Stop this fight between
a rhino and a rabbit.

43
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,535
This game will stop
only after one of the two is dead.

44
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,530
The rate's 100 for 10.

45
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,198
You bet too!

46
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:06,902
Oh shut up!

47
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,537
One. - Christa. Christa.

48
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,110
Two. - Christa. Christa.

49
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,373
Christa.

50
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,978
<i>Three. ~ Christa. Christa.</i>

51
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:16,547
Christa.

52
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,550
Move aside. Move.

53
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,388
Five.

54
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,129
Six. - Christa. Christa.

55
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,088
Samrat!

56
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,198
Samrat!

57
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,863
Seven. - Christa. Christa.

58
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,039
Christa.

59
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:43,406
Eight. - Christo. Christo.

60
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,352
Christopher!

61
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,086
Come on. Fight.

62
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:56,616
Its payback time.

63
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,220
Name: Christopher Barrett.

64
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,662
Three times Heavy Weight champion.

65
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,328
Unbeatable since 10 matches.
<i>7</i> knockouts.

66
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,656
Ego solid, but breakable.

67
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,029
Strong point: Right leg,
right punch and eyesight.

68
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,634
Weak point: Abdomen.

69
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,164
Recently been operated.

70
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,533
And now... the four steps of success.

71
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,344
First: Tell his ego to go to he**.

72
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,252
And his anger will drag him along.

73
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,953
Second: Attack his strong point.

74
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:35,996
Everything's fair in love and war..

75
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,263
..because there's no
second prize in both.

76
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,704
Now for the third degree.

77
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,708
Even zero degree ice..

78
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,944
..can't soothe the
pain of my third degree.

79
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,613
And losers always face this brunt.

80
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,457
One. - Come on, come on, come on.

81
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:11,828
Two.

82
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,838
Three.

83
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,340
Foun

84
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:19,910
Out.

85
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,910
And that's a knock out!

86
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,071
Knock out!

87
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:25,010
And the winner is Samrat Ti
akdhari!!

88
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,449
Friends, the next match is between
famous kick boxer Rajesh Marathe..

89
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:34,452
..and five time body-building
champion Martin D'souza.

90
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,460
The match starts in 15 minutes.

91
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,057
The betting has started.

92
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,252
Excuse me.

93
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,060
Your prize money.

94
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,132
You know where to deliver it.

95
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,429
You always donate your
prize money in charity.

96
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,033
Any special reason?

97
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,800
Madam, even reason
doesn't reason with STD.

98
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,377
STD? - Samrat Tilakdhari.

99
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,004
What question was
bothering you today..

100
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,012
..that you had to enter the ring?

101
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,980
The answer to some questions"

102
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,580
"are more questions.

103
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,650
You and your Samrat-ism.

104
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,218
You're offered so many cases
why don't you pick one?

105
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,653
They may be cases for you..

106
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,485
"but to me they are an insult.

107
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:46,589
What do you want me to?

108
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,498
Find Rocky's doggy?

109
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,058
Or..prove Mrs.
Sharma's affair with Mr.Verma..

110
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,158
"for suspicious Mr. Sharma.

111
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:58,536
I wonder what case you're waiting for
which is going to sweep u off your feet...

112
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,727
This gorgeous lady who wears a red
nail paint and red lipstick"

113
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,125
"loves the color of red blood.

114
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,701
Beware. Keep your eyes wide open.

115
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,795
Is this lady stalking you?

116
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,700
For now, Chakradhar bids you adieu.

117
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,137
We'll meet again next week"

118
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,776
..in 'Chakradhar's Chakravuyh‘
with a new story.

119
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,912
The gorgeous lethal beauty! - What?

120
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,020
Red nail paint. Pink lipstick.

121
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:43,951
This is confusing...

122
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,121
What rubbish?

123
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,054
Is this Samrat Ti
akdhari's house?

124
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,585
She's asking for the right person
that means she isn't that girl.

125
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,986
Yes, this is his house.
Come in please.

126
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,092
What did you say your name was?

127
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,364
I didn't say that yet.
I am saying it now.

128
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,630
Dimpy Singh.

129
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,633
Will you please call him?
- Yes, yes, yes.

130
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,097
Please take a seat.

131
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,946
Don't be scared, it's dead.

132
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,313
Skulls are more dangerous
when they are alive.

133
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,142
First the beautiful
valleys of Shim
a..

134
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,147
“Then the skies of Delhi..

135
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,717
..and now Mumbai's traffic.

136
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,279
The journey must have been tiring.

137
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:52,979
Here.

138
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,787
How did you guess?

139
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,655
I think we're meeting
for the first time?

140
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,496
Do you need to meet
someone to know them?

141
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,563
And anyway,
I don't know much about you.

142
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,567
Except that you're the
daughter of an aristocrat"

143
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:06,996
"who lives in a town close to Shimla.

144
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,437
Your morning starts
with a cup of black coffee.

145
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,562
You read the Hindustan Times.

146
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,164
You used to wear glasses"

147
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,336
..but recently you
underwent a Laser Surgery.

148
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,337
You've been in a relationship"

149
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:15,341
"for more than six months"

150
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:16,137
..and you're also confused.

151
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,881
Not because the boy is poor,

152
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,584
But because your
family doesn't like him.

153
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,250
But your reason for coming here"

154
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,412
..is a family matter for which..

155
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,453
..you can't approach the police.

156
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,319
You don't want anyone
to know anything"

157
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,356
"not even that you're here.

158
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:28,922
Your return flight's
for today evening.

159
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,090
And by the way,
you play the guitar quite well.

160
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:34,529
Right?

161
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,100
How the he**

162
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,659
How the he** did you guess that?

163
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,203
Any 6th sense? - 7th.

164
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,106
Samrat Tilakdhari.

165
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,243
Dimpy Singh.

166
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,547
So, Dimpy... how can I help you?

167
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,152
It's an unusual mystery. - Mystery!

168
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,548
That's the point.

169
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,987
Then you rang the right doorbell.

170
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,994
Because mysteries
are his only friends.

171
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,030
Only condition is that
they should be confusing.

172
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,533
Butmbefore any mystery"

173
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,196
"here's a sugar-free good news.

174
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,833
111 people now watch your show.

175
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,771
No one can give you anything.

176
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,646
No surprise,
shock, happiness or any emotion.

177
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,915
By the way, he is..
- I've seen him on television.

178
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,818
'Chakradhar's Chakravuy'.

179
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,883
Right? - See. See.

180
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,019
She's seen my show.

181
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,087
I am the producer,

00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,526
and now except for 112 audiences,
everything else.

184
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,659
But my real introduction
is that I am Watson.

185
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:48,594
What son?

186
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,975
Not what son, Watson.

187
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,935
Sherlock Holmes, Watson.

188
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,401
That's the point.

189
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,340
Actually,
in his free time he lends me a hand.

190
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,244
So you were mentioning some mystery.

191
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,210
Yes.

192
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,246
Oh yes.

193
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:07,551
Actually, there's a
huge garden in our bungalow.

194
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,885
And for the past month"

195
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,359
...all the trees and
plants are slowly withering.

196
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,293
That's the point.

197
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,134
Madam, if Samrat grows
you another garden"

198
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,031
"what will the gardener do?

199
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,908
It's like you're trying to learn
maths from Shakespeare.

200
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,974
Please hear me out.

201
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,945
We approached the best
gardeners and horticulturists.

202
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,147
But no one could understand anything.

203
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,111
We also conducted a forensic
analysis of the mud.

204
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,611
But there's no problem.

205
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,980
And then...last week
papa's horse suddenly died.

206
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,922
And we couldn't find
a reason for that either.

207
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:47,226
Now tell me... How can I approach
the police with such a strange case?

208
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,197
First garden, then the horse.

209
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,833
You mean first gardener
and then a veterinarian.

210
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,467
Please go ahead.

211
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,308
Actually, few months ago"

212
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,742
..papa fired his oldest gardener.

213
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,209
He was accused of stealing.

214
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,840
And before leaving,
that gardener bedamned us.

215
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,919
I've raised this garden
with my blood and sweat.

216
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,148
And after I die...the plants and trees..

217
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,284
“Will slowly wither away.

218
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,154
That will be the
evidence of my innocence.

219
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,922
And last week your gardener
passed away. - Yes!

220
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,196
Yes.

221
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,867
And since then this string
of misfortunes started.

222
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:31,068
Everyone believes that his ghost...
- Sorry, Miss. Dimpy.

223
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,233
You've brought the wrong
case to the right place.

224
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:35,945
Not interested.

225
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,044
CD...hail a cab for her.

226
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:39,641
Listen.

227
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,480
I'll give you the
number of a witch-doctor.

228
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,951
It's not about the garden,
it's about my father...

229
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,722
Father has not been keeping well.

230
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,460
And the doctors say..

231
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,531
"he has no physical illness.

232
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,128
Does he believe in ghosts and spirits?

233
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:02,564
Earlier he did not...

234
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,566
But I guess now he does"

235
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,668
Because strange things
are happening around him.

236
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,106
He doesn't talk to anyone.

237
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,004
He's scared all the time.

238
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,915
The lights in his
room stay on all night.

239
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:19,080
Actually... papa's in the
same condition as the garden.

240
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,048
They both are withering away...

241
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,497
Did that light a fuse?

242
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,826
Yes, brother.

243
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,893
I am sorry I didn't
inform you earlier.

244
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,101
Yes. Actually he's with me.

245
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,075
Okay, brother, I'll see you soon.

246
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,578
You can ask me what you want to.

247
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,419
Yes.

248
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,448
I was wondering"

249
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,459
I mean...how does your 7th sense work?

250
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,462
That 7th sense is called Samrat-ism.

251
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,830
Samrat-ism?

252
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,331
Einstein used only 11% of his brain.

253
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,399
It's nothing but observation.

254
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,631
Posh branded purse, glares, watch"

255
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:12,842
..a sign of richness.

256
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:16,073
But using it carelessly,
a sign of aristocracy.

257
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,082
Few days ago,
my interview was published..

258
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,077
..in Hindustan Times Delhi edition"

259
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,377
"regarding the case
I solved in Noida..

260
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,441
..the article didn't have
my phone number, but my address.

261
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,079
So you didn't call, you came directly.

262
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,656
Recently you underwent laser surgery.

263
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,090
Your eyes are perfectly fine now.

264
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,122
But still back in my house
while reading the magazine..

265
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,921
“Habitually your fingers
reached up to your forehead“.

266
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,565
"looking for your glasses.

267
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,567
The fingers on your right
hand are very beautiful.

268
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,431
But the tips on your
left hand fingers..

269
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,232
"are a bit coarse,
which is often what guitarists have.

270
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,435
Excuse me, sir. Juice. - No, thanks.

271
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,739
No.

272
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,674
But I am from Himacha
..
- The tag on your handbag.

273
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:50,675
It showed that you
took a flight from Shimla.

274
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,445
When you were taking
your mobile phone..

275
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,376
..out of your purse,
I noticed your car keys.

276
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,820
Driving all the way to Shimla,
without a driven.

277
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,184
"meant you didn't
want anyone to know"

278
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,552
..about your trip and it's reason.

279
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,151
And no luggage means,
return flight in the evening.

280
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,653
But the luggage could be
in the hotel as well. - No ways.

281
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,223
You were so eager to meet me..

282
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,095
..that you didn't
even wait at the airport.

283
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,728
In fact, you touched
up your lipstick in the taxi.

284
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,297
And due to the road
conditions of Mumbai..

285
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,162
..it smudged a bit,
and though you tried to clean it..

286
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,633
..you couldn't.

287
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,076
Okay.

288
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,374
And... about my about relationship?

289
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:24,906
Your phone.

290
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,709
This mobile phone is like a blemish..

291
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,581
..on your beautiful personality
and it's 6 months old.

292
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,577
And it's not a gift
from any family member..

293
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,413
"but a memorabilia
of a struggler boyfriend"

294
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,385
"because you still have it.

295
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,588
And the scratches on it..

296
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,588
“Reveal your confusion
about your relationship.

297
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:39,957
Amazing.

298
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,126
I thought you were just guessing.

299
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:43,891
I hate guessing.

300
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,264
I love to be sure.

301
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:51,031
Madam, his name...STD,
has another meaning.

302
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:54,840
'Sharp Teekhi Drishti'.
Meaning a piercing eyesight.

303
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,471
Good evening,
this is your captain Vikrant Parmar.

304
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,713
We should be landing
in the next 20 minutes.

305
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,178
The weather outside is pleasant"

306
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,179
..and the temperature
is 14 degree celcius.

307
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,680
Shimla isn't too far now.

308
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,047
Flight attendants,
prepare for landing please.

309
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,115
Thank you.

310
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,154
There's something in the air...

311
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:43,758
Definitely.

312
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,122
Samrat.

313
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,461
He's my eldest brother Sanjay Singh.

314
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,363
Samrat. - Welcome, Samrat.

315
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:51,734
Thank you.

316
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,842
And that's.. - Your second
brother Vijay Singh, and..

317
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:02,103
...he'll make an unsuccessful effort
to drive me away.

318
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,743
Hari. - Yes, sir.

319
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,713
Put his luggage back into the car.
- Yes, sir.

320
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,107
Brother.

321
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,519
We don't need any detective here.

322
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,024
Vijay, he's hereto help us.

323
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,417
HelP-H

324
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:16,716
Do you also think
we need a detective"

325
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,090
Fire! Fire!

326
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,391
Come quickly.
Get water.

327
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,625
Fast!

328
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,226
Hurry up!
Quickly.

329
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,293
Get more water quickly.
Come on.

330
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,034
Get water.
Throw water quickly.

331
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,102
Brother, careful.

332
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,935
Hurry UP!

333
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,435
Throw the water.

334
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,371
Throw the water, Shiv.

335
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,972
There's an old truth that love,
cough and crime are difficult to hide.

336
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,775
But I can hide your secrets.

337
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:39,342
What?

338
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,344
What secrets?

339
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,210
There's no smoke without fire,
Mr. Vijay.

340
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,856
The name of the gorgeous
who's perfume you're smelling of..

341
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,620
..or the jockey you secretly bet on...

342
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,618
They can remain a secret.

343
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,323
More water.

344
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,956
Throw more water.

345
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,132
What's going on here?

346
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,563
I don't get it.

347
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,107
I guess someone's jinxed this house.

348
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,239
Half the servants have already
fled fearing a ghost.

349
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,046
And the rest"

350
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,243
Anyway, Vijay,
you were saying that we"

351
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,778
No, brother...I..

352
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,850
I have no problem with him.

353
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:24,917
Actually...I'm concerned
about papa's reaction.

354
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,597
No, no need to tell
papa that he's a detective.

355
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,867
He's Dimpy friend,
and he's from Mumbai.

356
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,121
There are more things
in Heaven and earth"

357
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,047
"than in your philosophy.

358
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,652
William Shakespeare,
Hamlet, Act 1 Scene 5.

359
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,185
Oh...

360
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:01,792
Dimpy told me about you.

361
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:08,028
But she didn't say
that... you're an encyclopedia.

362
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,234
I apologize sir,
I haven't read Hamlet.

363
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:13,236
I just read the quotes
along with the writers names“.

364
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,068
..on your bookshelf.

365
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,104
Oh...

366
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,981
Good speed.

367
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,779
Sit.

368
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:32,023
Do you know the story behind this pen?

369
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:34,960
May I?

370
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,933
Plucked from a bird's
wing and turned into a pen.

371
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,969
Wrong.

372
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:47,277
As a pen it made it's era immortal.

373
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,105
It's a special antique.

374
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,208
Invaluable.

375
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,111
William Shakespeare
used to write with this pen.

376
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:01,216
Around 500 years ago.

377
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:09,890
Can you imagine...Hamlet,
Macbeth, Othello...

378
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:13,231
Those famous sonnets"

379
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,228
"they were all written with this.

380
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,240
Those immortal...

381
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:25,239
Anywaymto come back to the quote.

382
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:32,251
The eyes see only what our mind knows.

383
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,121
Welcome...

384
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,518
But with a request.

385
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:43,929
You're here as a friend,
so behave like one.

386
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,203
Intelligent consulting
private investigator“.

387
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,541
..Mr. Samrat Tilakdhari.

388
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,913
Dimpy's version and
the Mahendra Pratap we met..

389
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:02,145
..are as different
as chalk and cheese.

390
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,148
And how did he know you're STD?

391
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,615
From the same Hindustan
Times article..

392
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,214
"from where Dimpy got my address.

393
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,483
It was on the top of the rack.

394
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:13,319
Come, Samrat.

395
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:14,287
Let me introduce you.

396
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:15,093
Mr. Agnihotri. - Hello.

397
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,155
Mr. Agnihotri, this is Samrat.

398
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:17,857
Mr. Agnihotri is our horticulturist.

399
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,535
Mr. Agnihotri,
do you believe in ghosts?

400
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,271
I didn't earlier.

401
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,869
But now I feel that...

402
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:33,516
..where nature ends,
the supernatural begins.

403
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,522
She's my younger sister, Divya.

404
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,025
"Life's filled with questions."

405
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,121
She's been like this
since her childhood.

406
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,496
"It's hazy all around."

407
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,501
Filled with a void.

408
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,372
Lost in herself.

409
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,205
"Who are these eyes looking for?"

410
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:59,139
She's also undergoing treatment.

411
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:00,501
Psychiatric.

412
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,043
"There's a fog all around."

413
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:15,089
"There's a whisper."

414
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:23,063
"Why does loneliness
kindle a flame within?"

415
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,942
This is a 2 week old recording.

416
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,041
Some claim that they've seen
this ghost with their own eyes.

417
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:41,243
What? They have? - Yes.

418
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,253
Samrat, let's leave this
haunted house right now. Please.

419
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,379
Let's go.

420
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,084
And listen,
I'll really give you the number..

421
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,522
..of a witch-doctor.

422
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,020
He's a big tantric. Call him.

423
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,288
One is coming.

424
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,095
He's returning tomorrow"

425
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,324
"from his hermitage in Belgium.

426
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,455
<i>Satyadev Babe.</i>

427
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,091
He's not a tantric, but"

428
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,965
..he's a powerful
spiritual personality.

429
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:36,537
Sir, the one sitting close to the Baba..

430
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,241
Your boss Mahendra Pratap Singh.

431
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,171
On the left are Vijay
and his wife Revati.

432
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,103
On the right are Sanjay
Singh and his wife Sunita.

433
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,237
In the middle, their sister Divya.

434
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:45,879
The one at the back is Puran kaka.

435
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,315
That's Shanti, Puran kaka's daughter.

436
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,176
And Rani, her assistant.

437
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,921
Sir, Dimpy ma'am told
me to tell you about everyone.

438
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,557
But already you know everything.

439
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:58,225
Your Dimpy ma'am told me.

440
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12,305
But...she didn't tell me about him.

441
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,669
Who is he? - Sir, he's Deepak.

442
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,941
He's a manager in the boss' company.

443
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,287
And. . .these two?

444
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,279
Sir, that's Mrs.
Narayani and Mr. Kishore.

445
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,756
The neighbors.

446
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,122
They shifted here two months back.

447
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,286
Sir, Mr. Kishore loves
antiques like our boss.

448
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,097
That's why they got along really well.

449
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:38,895
Who told you that's the
reason for their friendship?

450
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,261
Sir...

451
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:41,331
Relax. That IS the reason.

452
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:07,258
I've liberated this
place from the evil spirit.

453
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:11,527
Now it will never trouble anyone.

454
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,127
Just remember one thing.

455
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,369
Don't let anyone untie this knot.

456
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,868
Tomorrow at dawn,
if any bud blossoms here"

457
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:31,146
..then you can consider
that the curse has been lifted.

458
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:37,450
Hail God!

459
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,921
Bless you!

460
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,876
I like mystery.

461
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,512
There's smoke but no fire.

462
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:58,410
There's a shadow but no ray of light.

463
00:28:58,504 --> 00:28:59,949
There're words but nothing to say.

464
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,046
Sometimes one needs
to be puzzled to unravel mysteries..

465
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,520
..and I am totally ready for it.

466
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,618
Whether you get it or not,
from Mumbai to Barei

y..

467
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:08,123
. .All want Shanti .

468
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,854
By the way, I self Shanti.

469
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:11,585
How do you?
What would you take?

470
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,728
Tea or coffee?

471
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,661
Or you see.. - Black..coffee.

472
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:15,997
Coffee. - Yes.

473
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,158
Black.

474
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,129
By the way,
your incoming here is useless.

475
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,995
Because your job
is to catch the living beings..

476
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,128
"not the dead.

477
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,735
By the way,
what will the second sahib will take?

478
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,165
Buttermilk without curd.

479
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:32,113
You see all home burden
on my small headmhnn...

480
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:35,948
You felt like kin
so I opened up my heart.

481
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,610
Otherwise I talk very less.

482
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:39,720
Workload, no time you see.

483
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,150
Shall we?

484
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,650
Hey, you my assistant.

485
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,153
You order, I fire.

486
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,158
If I not here, wonder what will happen
to this house.

487
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,196
Shanti. (Peace)

488
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,568
Brrrr...It's a sin to wash your hands..

489
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,044
..in this cold weather of Shimla.

490
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:07,140
It's cold. It's very cold.

491
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,177
Where's my watch?

492
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,749
It was right here.

493
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:13,184
Chatterbox took it.

494
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:14,689
Chatterbox?

495
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,084
Oh...her.

496
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:18,985
And you let that thief take it.

497
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,189
She isn't a thief.

498
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,589
If she was, then she would've"

499
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:24,224
..taken the 1000 rupee
notes sticking out of your wallet.

500
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,532
She's a kleptomaniac. - Oh.

501
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:30,801
You mean she has a
habit of stealing. - Yes...

502
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:39,542
Some diseases are so strange.

503
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,612
My grandma used to make
bitter gourds in her sleep.

504
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,511
What are you doing here?

505
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:47,616
Uh... umm... Nothing"

506
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,161
Sir..... I was looking for you, sir.

507
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:54,130
I was looking for you.

508
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,956
I am a big fan of yours.

509
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:58,760
I stayed up all night"

510
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,031
..and increased the
TRP of your program.

511
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,068
Just like you get in
the skin of your character..

512
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:07,941
“Similarly,
there are many characters in me.

513

Full name.

Mother's name Saraswati Chauhan.

Age, 36 years 9 months 8 days and..

518

..this is the 16th hour.

519
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:28,798
If you're pushing your car..

520
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:31,691
..because you've a flat tire,
then you're alive.

521
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,164
After being caught
for drinking and driving..

522
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,962
..you don't get beaten up
by the police, then you're alive.

523
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,232
Whether the government runs or not..

524
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:42,240
..if you're driving your car,
then you're alive.

525
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,236

Please.

529

Sir, just like a big superstar..

bungalow, fame and fortune.

But I am in a hurry, sir.

533

00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,199
Thank you.

539
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,202
Thank you. - It's okay.

540
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,208
Was he a fool or
trying to make us one?

541
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,575
A man isn't what he shows.

542
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:23,148
He's what he hides.

543
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,978
Hey super express!

544
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:55,241
Can't you see where you're going?

545
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,451
You fool,
a bud has blossomed in the garden.

546
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,244
Bad spirit gone out.

547
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:01,953
Great!

548
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,682
Ghost is gone, flower in garden.

549
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:04,988
Ghost is gone, flower in garden.

550
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,261
Thank God!
Isn't that wonderful news?

551
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:10,365
There are more things
in Heaven and Earth"

552
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,929
"than your knowledge.

553
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,229
STD, Believe it or not,
there was a ghost in this house.

554
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,936
And see...as soon as the ghost fled“

555
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,976
"the garden has started
to blossom again.

556
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,737
The smallest case in STD's life.

557
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:27,378
The End right after
the opening titles.

558
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,428
I am so happy, Samrat.

559
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,193
I came here to say thanks.

560
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:46,868
But I didn't do anything.

561
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,128
Sometimes someone's presence..

562
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,568
..makes a lot of difference. - Thanks.

563
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,569
But do you think this flowen.

564
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:55,535
..is a reasonable reason to smile?

565
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,546
No matter what the reason is..

566
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,179
"but happiness has finally returned.

567
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,745
And on this particular day.

568
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,279
Tomorrow is papa's birthday.

569
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:04,416
And there is small get-together
this evening.

570
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:08,149
Please do come - Sure.

571
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,685
Every man has the same nature.

572
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,591
It's only their habits
that make them different.

573
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,826
Keep your eyes and ears open.

574
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,659
There are too many questions"

575
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,200
..and just one night
to find the answers...

576
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:19,861
...That's tonight.

577
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,168
You meanmghost"

578
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:25,834
The ghost hasn't fled?

579
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,742
The ghost that scared everyone"

580
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,471
"gets scared by a red cloth?

581
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,879
Flowers blooming due
to the grace of Belgium Baba?

582
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,116
Mahendra Pratap Singh still is sad..

583
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,150
..even after the ghost fled...

584
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,413
Hari hiding behind the door...

585
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,148
Vijay detesting our presence...

586
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,851
All these events point
towards something untoward.

587
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:44,854
That's the point.

588
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,857
Why can't I think of all this?

589
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,100
Anyway, nights are the
mother of all mysteries.

590
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,925
"The night's acrid."

591
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,359
"Sometimes it feels pleasing."

592
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,993
"The secrets of the hearts."

593
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,862
"Are never known to anyone."

594
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:30,403
"There's a spark under
the layers of ice."

595
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,033
"There's fog all around."

596
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:36,375
"There's a gesture on the lips."

597
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,078
"But without voice."

598
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,918
"Pick up a glass of tequila."

599
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:45,247
"Forget all your sorrows."

600
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,250
"Enchanting are the blue eyes."

601
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,060
" Beware... Stay aware..."

602
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:54,154
"Pick up a glass of tequila."

603
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:57,499
"Forget all your sorrows."

604
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:00,160
"Enchanting are the blue eyes."

605
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,199
" Beware... Stay aware..."

606
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,043
VijaY-

607
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,050
Are you okay? - Of course, why?

608
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:21,719
Are you sure? - Yes, I am fine.

609
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:28,195
Come, I'll introduce
you to a special guest.

610
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:29,898
Come.

611
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,866
Let me introduce you.

612
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:35,004
This is our lawyer Dinesh Das.

613
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,071
You can also call him DD.

614
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,868
I am used to CD.

615
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,669
I'll get used to DD as well.

616
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:46,207
Famous detective... Mr.
Samrat Tilakdhari.

617
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,916
DD sir, being famous is a..

618
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:52,579
"disgusting by product of my job.

619
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,013
Sanjay.

620
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:56,153
Sorry, excuse me.

621
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:57,559
Sanjay, come with me.

622
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,092
Divya's unwell again.

623
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,157
I'll just be back. - Excuse me.

624
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,155
Please carry on.

625
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,193
Poor Sanjay.

626
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,199
I guess Divya's
getting the fits again.

627
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,888
So... Mahendra
Pratap has changed his will.

628
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:31,186
Yes, he did in a big haste.

629
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,827
He got all the papers
ready within 2 days.

630
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,496
And signed it too.

631
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:39,933
It seemed like he was
going to forsake everything"

632
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,399
..and retire to the Himalayas.

633
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,734
But how did you know?

634
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,670
My job is to arrive at conclusions"

635
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,270
"from observations, DD sir.

636
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:56,017
The blue ink on your
thumb is still wet.

637
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,013
And the thumb print is required..

638
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:59,021
..when you need to get some"

639
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:00,556
"important documents signed.

640
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:05,150
Like invaluable
property papers or...will.

641
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:10,429
"Everyone's a stranger here."

642
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,898
"Everyone's lost in themselves."

643
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:16,163
"Away from the waves."

644
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:19,335
"The river is still thirsty."

645
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,068
"Everyone's a stranger here."

646
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:25,013
"Everyone's lost in themselves."

647
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:28,245
"Away from the waves."

648
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,580
"The river is still thirsty."

649
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,251
"Either hide those pure intentions."

650
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,585
"Or commit this crime."

651
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,324
"Steal a few momentsu"

652
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:43,058
"..from the time that
stands still and smile."

653
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:46,436
"Pick up a glass of tequila."

654
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,161
"Forget all your sorrows."

655
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,134
"Enchanting are the blue eyes."

656
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:54,968
" Beware... Stay aware..."

657
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,338
"Pick up a glass of tequila."

658
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,211
"Forget all your sorrows."

659
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,952
"Enchanting are the blue eyes."

660
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,447
" Beware... Stay aware..."

661
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:20,603
I think papa must be ready.

662
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,069
I should go fetch him.

663
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:23,802
I'll go get him.

664
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,137
She dances really well. - Oh yes.

665
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,542
Vijay sir has killed his fatherl!

666
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:45,250
Papa!

667
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,358
Send the body for post
mortem after taking photos.

668
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:49,391
Yes, sir.

669
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,929
Don't miss any evidence. - Yes, sir.

670
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,762
And no one enters this area..

671
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,396
...until the investigation is over.

672
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,447
I said no one enters this area.

673
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,446
Cooperate with us, please.

674
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,052
And everyone go wait in the hall.

675
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,785
We'll call you one by one.

676
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:55,353
You come with us.

677
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:57,822
Come on.

678
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,375
I never imagined that"

679
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,981
..their frequent quarrels
would lead to this.

680
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:18,949
The reason for these quarrels,
Puran kaka?

681
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:21,019
Vijay's behavior.

682
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,456
Vijay had no interest in business.

683
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:28,462
He would squander money on bad habits.

684
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,499
In a fit of rage the master..

685
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,793
..put a stop to his squandering"

686
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:36,463
..and the quarrels started since then.

687
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,464
Relax.

688
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:45,477
Now tell me everything
that happened tonight in detail.

689
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:48,779
I was in the kitchen.

690
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,416
Just then...I received
a call from the master.

691
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:57,192
Hello. - Bring a jug
of water to my room, Puran.

692
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:58,422
Yes, sir.

693
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:02,420
Vijay, my money isn't
for you to squander.

694
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,395
I won't give you a penny.

695
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:07,262
I will take it, papa..

696
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,068
“Even if I have
to do anything for it.

697
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:10,167
Master would often forget"

698
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:11,969
"to switch off the cordless phone.

699
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:13,876
But Vijay's
quarrels with the master..

700
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:15,468
..had become a common thing.

701
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,204
So I hung up the phone"

702
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,407
..and went into master's
room with the water.

703
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:23,817
Master!!!

704
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:30,449
Vijay sir has killed his fatherl!

705
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,487
Did you see Vijay..

706
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:36,197
"pressing on or
taking off the pillow?

707
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:37,528
Taking it off.

708
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,195
But what does it all mean?

709
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,533
I don't deduce conclusions so soon,
Puran kaka.

710
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,471
All I know is that
one should believe“.

711
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:47,401
"someone who's doubted the most.

712
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:51,870
He would often be brash with papa..

713
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:54,439
..but that doesn't mean that Vijay..

714
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,445
No. No way.

715
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,116
Brother couldn't have killed papa.

716
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,451
Find the real killer at any cost.

717
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,454
Sir. - Sit.

718
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,132
Where are the CCTV cameras
installed in the house?

719
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,494
Ground floor, first floon.

720
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:14,498
..and everywhere outside.

721
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:15,902
And second floor?

722
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:18,504
Everyone's bedrooms are
on the second floor, 50..

723
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,041
Oh, I see.

724
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,404
Sir, this is the party's footage.

725
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,357
Who is he?

726
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,590
The one who's secretly
getting into the party?

727
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:41,026
That's Anuj.

728
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,257
Dimpy's...friend.

729
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:46,428
In fact papa and everyone else..

730
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:48,026
..were strictly
against Dimpy's choice.

731
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,533
Because he's such a loser.

732
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,240
In fact,
two days ago papa warned him..

733
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,843
"not to come anywhere close to Dimpy.

734
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,202
But he was here.

735
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:59,974
I didn't know it.

736
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,946
Love no doubt gives you courage.

737
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,752
Do you suspect anyone? - No.

738
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:07,455
I cannot doubt anyone.

739
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:10,754
Interesting. . .kids.

740
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:14,325
Do you come here every day?
- Yes, Samrat.

741
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,221
Since childhood,
I've been a believer“.

742
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:19,995
..in Vivekanand's saying "A
healthy mind lives in a healthy body".

743
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,499
And I teach them martial
arts to keep them healthy.

744
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:25,268
So that they don't lose
hope in life without fighting.

745
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:26,840
Good.

746
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:28,469
You live up to your
name: Deepak (lamp).

747
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,871
A lamp burns to enlighten others.

748
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,440
By the way,
what's your view about Vijay?

749
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:38,178
I've no position to have
a view about my masters.

750
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:39,846
By the way, think about it yourself"

751
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:42,424
..if Sanjay sir doubted his brothen.

752
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,023
"would he spend all
night arranging for Vijay's bail?

753
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:47,591
Sir, we'll know the real matter..

754
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:48,687
“Only after the reports come in.

755
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,732
This is a high-profile
and sensitive case.

756
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,998
Do it under the wrap. - Yes, sir.

757
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,364
Sir, we arrested Vijay yesterday.

758
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:56,635
The evidence.. - Good morning, sir.

759
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,199
Samrat!

760
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:01,639
How are you doing?

761
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:02,573
Very fine Sir.

762
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:03,709
Khalid. - Yes, sir.

763
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:04,745
This is Samrat.

764
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,049
My best student.

765
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,246
Batch...2008, right? - Bang on, sir.

766
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:14,316
He had to leave IPS
because of weak eyesight.

767
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,147
But he has a strong vision.

768
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:18,184
That's why he's still
doing the same job.

769
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:19,961
The search of truth.

770
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,925
Right? - Right, sir.

771
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,028
What brings you here?

772
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,893
The Mahendra Pratap
Singh murder case, sir.

773
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:29,733
Khalid was telling
me about the same case.

774
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:31,069
Oh really?

775
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,841
Khalid, do help Samrat.

776
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:36,902
And if required,
take his help as well.

777
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,277
All the best.

778
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,570
Nice seeing you, sir.

779
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:43,409
Insp. Khalid, with your permission"

780
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:44,578
..can I see Vijay?

781
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,584
You do have Sir's permission.

782
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,381
And let me know if
you find out anything else.

783
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,958
Because now I have to help you..

784
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:52,653
..and take your help too.

785
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:55,461
If you want my help
then tell me the truth.

786
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:59,692
I was in the party
when papa called me.

787
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:10,036
Yes, papa.
- Come to my room right now.

788
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:14,581
No, I can't come now.
- How dare you say no to me?

789
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,213
Come now or you won't get a penny.

790
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:35,062
Yes, papa, why did you call me?

791
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,735
Papa!

792
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:48,676
Master!!

793
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:54,679
Vijay sir has killed his fatherl!

794
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,457
Mr. Vijay,
truth isn't a coin that has two sides.

795
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,730
Either you're lying or Puran Kaka is.

796
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:10,662
Sir. - Come, Samrat.

797
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,371
I've something to show you.

798
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,804
There are strange mails..

799
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,711
..in Mahendra Pratap's email account.

800
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:20,074
The first mail came one month ago.

801
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:23,081
And then similar mails
came every 4-5 days.

802
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,080
The IP address for
each mail is different"

803
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,050
..so it's difficult
to trace the sender.

804
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:29,081
And even the code language..

805
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,120
"can't be decoded.

806
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,126
Sir, I had a word
with the language expert.

807
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:34,562
He thinks this is some
old African language.

808
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:35,828
He's trying.

809
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:37,161
We'll soon reach a conclusion.

810
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,164
Sir, can these emails
be forwarded to me?

811
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:41,526
Of course.

812
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:43,102
Khalid. - Sir.

813
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,075

816
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:42,416
On the night of the murder..

817
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,390
"Mahendra Pratap was
sitting on this chair..

818
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:44,949
..and talking to Puran kaka.

819
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,458
Standing in front was a furious Vijay.

820
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:49,459
Vijay lost his coolmand he started"

821
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,500
"strangling Mahendra Pratap Singh.

822
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,566
Mahendra Pratap struggled"

823
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,534
..and in this battle
between life and death..

824
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:56,435
"death won.

825
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:02,337
When he died...the phone
must have slipped from his hand.

826
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,709
My memory can't deceive me.

827
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,746
The phone wasn't here that night.

828
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:07,976
It wasn't anywhere.

829
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:10,911
So where was the phone that night?

830
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:21,586
You can't bind time"

831
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,022
..at least wear your watch.

832
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:24,518
Puran kaka returned it.

833
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:25,626
It's right there.

834
00:51:27,118 --> 00:51:29,189
Oh, that's the point.

835
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,192
Thank God you told me.

836
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:32,894
Otherwise I would've thought..

837
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:33,867
"this is the ghosﬁs doing.

838
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:36,138
CD, I went out to look for the ghost"

839
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:37,531
"but I returned
with evidence instead.

840
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:40,901
Last night, I saw Enid Blyton and..

841
00:51:41,132 --> 00:51:43,578
..Hardy Boy's books on
Mahendra Pratap's book shelf.

842
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:45,170
SQ?

843
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:48,484
How's it connected with this
jumbled up ABCD of some kid?

844
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:50,146
That's the point.

845
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:53,814
Life is an unsolved puzzle,
and I love it.

846
00:51:54,912 --> 00:51:58,917
HSR SHLD SN OZX ENQ XNTQ NKC RHM..

847

..I know what it means.

848
00:52:01,352 --> 00:52:02,330
Guess.

849
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:06,834
I am CD not STD. - It's simple CD.

850
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:09,000
Replace every letter with its latter..

851
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:12,097
..in the same setup
and the message is clear.

852
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,434
Like...

853
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,775
Replace H with I.

854
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:20,443
S with T.

855
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,784
And R with S.

856
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:24,811
That's ITS.

857
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:26,144
And likewise.

858
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:31,217
And the message is... 'It's
Time To Pay For Your Old Sin'.

859
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:33,684
Oh!

860
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,423
That means an old secret is out.

861
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,428
I'll try the second one.

862
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:48,437
Death...Is...The...

863
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:51,970
Rice.

864
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:53,571
Not Rice, CD, Price.

865
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:56,408
Oh yes, Price.

866
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,753
Death...Is...The...Price.

867
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,279
Yes.

868
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:03,751
And this...mail just
one day before the party.

869
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:06,086
Life's ultimate goal is death.

870
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:07,623
Happy Birthday.

871
00:53:08,052 --> 00:53:08,757
Get it?

872
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:11,130
It wasn't the gardener's spirit"

873
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:12,133
...it was these dreadful mails..

874
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,760
..that were scaring
Late Mahendra Pratap Singh.

875
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,500
Thank you
Samrat, for sharing this information.

876
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:19,866
You really are smart.

877
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:21,469
Arjun sir was right.

878
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:23,904
I misjudged you.

879
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:26,914
It's absolutely fine.

880
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:29,477
Khalid. What does the
post-mortem report say?

881
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:31,278
Nothing unusual.

882
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:32,453
As expected.

883
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,255
The reason of death is asphyxiation.

884
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,451
Vijay Singh has been granted bail.

885
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,954
He's got bail,
let's see what he gets in the will.

886
00:53:41,018 --> 00:53:45,160
According to Late Mahendra
Pratap Singh's will“.

887
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:48,232
..50% share of his property"

888
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:52,169
“will go to a
charitable organization“

889
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:55,075
..which runs an orphanage.

890
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,773
And the remaining 50%
will be equally divided..

891
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:04,917
"between his children : Sanjay,
Vijay, Divya and Dimpy.

892
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:06,413
I don't accept this will.

893
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:08,749
Since when did he start doing charity?

894
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,585
He never gave a penny to a beggar.

895
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:13,951
Disgusting!

896
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:16,128
Control yourself, Vijay.

897
00:54:16,387 --> 00:54:19,630
The law will accept this will only.

898
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,563
By the way,
when did papa sign this will?

899
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:28,104
On the 11th of this month at 11:15 pm.

900
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:30,637
But why did he change the will?

901
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,102
What was the reason?

902
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:33,114
Will anyone tell me?

903
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,679
The reason behind the
will and kill is the same.

904
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,774
I am sure.

905
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:40,244
This case is taking
a new turn each day, CD.

906
00:54:41,245 --> 00:54:42,952
Some NGO benefitted from the will.

907
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,215
But no connection.

908
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:46,685
Or maybe indirect.

909
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:48,861
The person sending the threat mails..

910
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:49,860
..is an old friend or foe.

911
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:52,464
But why would he
leave behind evidence?

912
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:53,460
The garden was withering"

913
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:55,169
"but it turned lush green again
when Belgium Baba arrived.

914
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:56,864
The gardener's ghost mystery...

915
00:54:57,361 --> 00:54:59,238
Everything's clear
but everything's fake.

916
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,375
There are many paths in this maze"

917
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,710
..but only one heads
towards the destination.

918
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:05,705
That's the point.

919
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:08,640
But aren't all these evidences
pointing towards something?

920
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,280
CD a smart criminal isn't someone
who doesn't leave behind evidence.

921
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,384
It's someone who does
leave behind an evidence..

922
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:16,382
"but only to mislead us.

923
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,319
What?

924
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,322
Papa was getting threat mails?

925
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,894
I don't know anything about it.

926
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:27,395
Who?

927
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:29,398
Who was sending papa
these threat mails?

928
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:31,395
We're still mum on whom.

929
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,104
Did your papa have any enemies?

930
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:35,402
There's no dearth of people"

931
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,268
"who are jealous
of someone's success.

932
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:41,414
Butmsomeone who would take his life?

933
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:43,413
I don't think so.

934
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:46,147
Mahendra Pratap was a very nice man.

935
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,156
He reminded me of my father.

936
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,053
He would share many things with me..

937
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:52,321
"other than business. - Really?

938
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:55,063
Did he ever mention the threats mails?

939
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,355
<i>Never.</i>

940
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,155
He never said anything.

941
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:00,367
And...I can never imagine..

942
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:02,899
..that someone can threaten him.

943
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:04,799
But he did received threats.

944
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:07,066
Truth is like a ray of light.

945
00:56:07,164 --> 00:56:08,871
It won't go away
if you close your eyes.

946
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,278
According to you,
who was his most trusted soldier..

947
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,370
"who's known him for years.

948
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:16,077
This happened 26 years ago.

949
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,610
It was our first
madam's 2nd death anniversary.

950
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:19,944
First madam?

951
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:22,450
Yes, my step mother...

952
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:24,119
Papa's first wife.

953
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:26,818
Brother Sanjay and sister
Divya are her children.

954
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:28,089
Oh, I see.

955
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:29,820
I am listening, Puran kaka.

956
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,992
There was a man called Nagendra.

957
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:35,167
He would often get in master's ways.

958
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:39,200
His car was rammed by a truck.

959
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,205
The entire family died instantly.

960
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:44,844
There was one body missing.

961
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,776
Nagendra's <i>7</i> year old son.

962
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:50,713
People say he's still alive.

963
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:55,282
But his whereabouts is a big mystery.

964
00:56:55,546 --> 00:56:57,719
There are whispers that"

965
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:00,654
..our master had orchestrated
that accident.

966
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:02,730
Oh...

967
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,591
Maybe it's a story
of sweet strange revenge.

968
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:07,295
Now the clouds are clear.

969
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:09,394
I can see the sky.

970
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:11,400
It was late Mahendra
Pratap Singh's guilt"

971
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:13,402
"not his fear that
made him change his will...

972
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:15,802
...and donate 50% to the orphanage.

973
00:57:16,867 --> 00:57:18,972
What's the point of all this now?

974
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,077
The master's already dead.

975
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:28,953
Yes, Khalid.

976
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:30,284
We're unable to trace Anuj.

977
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:31,252
He's missing.

978
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:32,818
I'll find him.

979
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,256
Just text me his address.

980
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:45,767
First this cat keeps
crying all night..

981
00:57:45,863 --> 00:57:46,933
..and doesn't let me sleep, and now..

982
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:48,039
Hello.

983
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:49,169
Sir, I am Samrat.

984
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,207
I am investigating
Mahendra Pratap's murder.

985
00:57:52,436 --> 00:57:53,813
Where's your tenant Anuj?

986
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:55,212
Sir, he lives up here.

987
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:57,112
But I've no clue where
he has been since few days.

988
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,111
What do I say?

989
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:02,549
Anuj has no relatives or kin.

990
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:04,223
He was raised in an orphanage.

991
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:05,952
What to do?

992
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,126
I've to check Anuj's room.

993
00:58:08,452 --> 00:58:09,226
I can't give you his room keys"

994
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:11,624
"without his permission.

995
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,165
That's fine.
- Goodbye.

996
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:18,798
What were you saying...the
cat cries a lot at night?

997
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:20,641
Car?

998
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:23,007
Don't ask,
sir, sometimes she cries a lot.

999
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:24,910
But...why, sir?

1000
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,478
That's the point, STD.

1001
00:58:34,778 --> 00:58:36,121
Now I get everything.

1002
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,489
Anuj is the kid that
survived in the accident.

1003
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,489
And he avenged his family's death.

1004
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:41,829
Simple.

1005
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,157
Possible.

1006
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:45,997
CD, go home.

1007
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,494
I just remembered
something I've to do.

1008
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,428
What are you going to do without me?

1009
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,169
It's a small, simple task.

1010
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:52,270
Not of your caliber.

1011
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:53,406
Then it's okay.

1012
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:54,469
Go ahead.

1013
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,365
Anuj's phone is unreachable.

1014
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,531
His phone's switched off
since the night of the murder.

1015
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:32,437
I can't ask you that how did you know.

1016
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:36,467
But I would like to tell you that"

1017
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,473
..there was nothing left between us.

1018
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,815
But I am a bit concerned about him.

1019
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:42,944
I wish even he was.

1020
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:45,513
Have a look.

1021
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:51,452
What?

1022
01:00:57,054 --> 01:00:58,397
He's a bloody"

1023
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:01,497
I didn't know all this.

1024
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:04,239
But where did you find all this?

1025
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:07,406
Heart is fragile, handle it with care.

1026
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:08,834
Anuj's missing.

1027
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:10,473
I got my
hands on these pictures.

1028
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:12,876
I deleted the files from his computer.

1029
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:14,409
You can burn these.

1030
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:16,477
Parents often sound wrong"

1031
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:18,377
"but mostly they are right.

1032
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:24,091
What did Anuj say to you in the party?

1033
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:25,482
Party?

1034
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:27,489
Anuj didn't meet me that night.

1035
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,256
But yes, he called me and said..

1036
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:33,665
'Dimpy, I want to tell
you a secret about your family.'

1037
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:38,031
Any guesses what
he wanted to say. - No.

1038
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:40,608
Did you ever try
to find out the past"

1039
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:43,070
..of the person you were
planning your future with?

1040
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:46,538
The heart doesn't
ask questions, Samrat.

1041
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,547
It just trusts.

1042
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,820
He was raised in
Little Dreams Orphanage.

1043
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,116
His character. . .is untainted.

1044
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:57,789
Was. That's the point, STD.

1045
01:01:58,181 --> 01:01:58,989
Excuse me.

1046
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:02,856
STD, like I said this just
like a Bollywood revenge drama.

1047
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,757
A boy returns to avenge
his parents' death..

1048
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:07,027
"who died in an accident.

1049
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:11,164
Then he convinces a girl
from the same family of his love“.

1050
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:12,465
..and gains entrance into the house.

1051
01:02:12,663 --> 01:02:14,165
Sends threat mails.

1052
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:16,704
Gets the will transferred
in the name of the orphanage.

1053
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:19,470
And just like the threat mails..

1054
01:02:19,803 --> 01:02:21,146
"he turns Happy Birth Day..

1055
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:24,443
..into a Saddy Death Day.

1056
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:28,813
No film can ever equal
the twists of life, CD.

1057
01:02:29,713 --> 01:02:30,851
Even if I agree to what you say“.

1058
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:33,158
Why did Anuj need
to send threat mails..

1059
01:02:33,383 --> 01:02:36,796
..and make the garden wither
pretending to be the gardener's ghost.

1060
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:38,492
One more thing.

1061
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,462
If Anuj had left the city, then..

1062
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:43,098
..he wouldn't have left his
personal belongings in his room.

1063
01:02:43,627 --> 01:02:44,367
That's the point.

1064
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:46,301
That means your small job..

1065
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:49,304
..was to convince Maganlal and get
the key to Anuj's room. Right?

1066
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,670
I don't need a key to open locks, CD.

1067
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:52,869
You know that.

1068
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,607
I saw the entire CCTV
footage of the party.

1069
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:58,110
We can see Anuj secretly
entering the party.

1070
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:00,282
But not leaving.

1071
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:02,283
Where could he be?

1072
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:07,688
We saw him sneaking into
the house but not leaving.

1073
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:08,724
Where is he then?

1074
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:11,359
Come on Samrat.

1075
01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:15,832
Anuj didn't leave,
means he was here only.

1076
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:17,269
So you mean to say..

1077
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,169
Information is not knowledge, CD.

1078
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:20,367
We often find the first thing..

1079
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,431
"but we need to earn the second.

1080
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:23,037
Why didn't Anuj come out of the house?

1081
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,334
At 11:30 he was seen in this camera.

1082
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:26,403
At 11:40 he called Dimpy.

1083
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,470
But if he had entered the house..

1084
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:28,606
..he would've been
seen in this camera.

1085
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:29,508
But he wasn't.

1086
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,014
If he went out of the house..

1087
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:32,415
..he would've gone in this direction.

1088
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:34,146
And he would be seen in this camera.

1089
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:35,581
But he wasn't seen here either.

1090
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,126
If he had gone in this direction"

1091
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:39,353
..then this camera
would've captured him.

1092
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,758
100%...he master's killer catching.

1093
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:44,021
What a pair.

1094
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,392
Like James Bonding.

1095
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:50,371
He wasn't in this camera,
or this camera or this one.

1096
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:52,705
So where did Anuj..

1097
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,608
Anuj!

1098
01:03:58,301 --> 01:03:59,075
Samrat!

1099
01:03:59,169 --> 01:03:59,977
Samrat!

1100
01:04:00,237 --> 01:04:01,545
Tell me what's up!

1101
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:05,546
Samrat!

1102
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:07,618
Samrat!

1103
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:26,940
CD!

1104
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:46,087
Looking at the condition of the body..

1105
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,596
..I guess he died 3-4 days back.

1106
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:56,035
That's the point, STD.

1107
01:04:56,993 --> 01:05:00,031
There's a dead body
here and you're smiling.

1108
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:03,837
CD, do you know the
address to success?

1109
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:05,571
Tell me quickly.

1110
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:10,048
On the path of difficulty,
through the lane of questions"

1111
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:12,653
..in the alley of challenges.

1112
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:17,986
Come and get ready for
the interesting mystery-ride!

1113
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,543
'Revati's is in a
hurry to go somewhere.'

1114
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,078
'Oh, from a memorial
service to a party.'

1115
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,748
'That's called insentience.'

1116
01:05:49,012 --> 01:05:50,753
'N0 feelings or emotions.'
'Absolutely detached.'

1117
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,098
'Two phones,
two messages, two expressions.'

1118
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:03,832
'One from a girlfriend,
and the other for betting.'

1119
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:05,328
'Somewhere he's losing his heart.'

1120
01:06:05,562 --> 01:06:07,166
'And somewhere his mind's losing.'

1121
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:10,872
'Narayani couldn't
keep a watch on her watch.'

1122
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:12,373
'She wore it upside down.'

1123
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,213
'S0 shocked over a neighbor's death!'

1124
01:06:14,938 --> 01:06:16,747
'Either she has a deep
relationship or story.'

1125
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,579
Our calculations are all messed up.

1126
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:21,912
The one we suspected is dead.

1127
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,021
Who is doing all this?

1128
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:26,722
That's the point.

1129
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:29,687
We'll know soon.

1130
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:35,627
My dear my friends,
I know this isn't the right time.

1131
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:37,831
But I have good news for you, that"

1132
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:41,033
..I am just one step
away from the murderer.

1133
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,538
Anuj knew the murderer,
that's why he was killed.

1134
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:48,843
The person who has donned
the mask of decency..

1135
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:50,009
“Will be unmasked soon.

1136
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,758
You're no longer what
you used to be, STD.

1137
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:00,253
You didn't tell me.

1138
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,460
I would, if I knew.

1139
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,430
Arrow in darkness, CD.

1140
01:07:04,788 --> 01:07:05,823
I played a blind.

1141
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:07,465
We'll share the loot
if we hit jackpot.

1142
01:07:07,824 --> 01:07:08,461
Oh, I see.

1143
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,331
So there's no bride and
you've announced marriage!

1144
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:13,803
How will you find the truth so soon?

1145
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:15,809
The truth will come to us, CD.

1146
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:17,968
How will it come to us?

1147
01:07:18,435 --> 01:07:20,108
You and your Samrat-ism.

1148
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,414
My prayers work like a charm, sir.

1149
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,518
Please spare me some change.

1150
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:31,883
May God bless you.

1151
01:07:35,986 --> 01:07:37,659
The beggars here are really generous.

1152
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:40,101
He gave us something in return.

1153
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:44,494
S...S...Samrat...

1154
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:46,769
It's a bomb!

1155
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:59,552
Bomb"

1156
01:08:03,046 --> 01:08:04,286
Throw it..!

1157
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:12,590
This is not meant to kill.
It's carrying a message.

1158
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,798
Next time the bomb will be real.

1159
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,808
If you value your
life then head back home.

1160
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:25,971
The watch is from a pen-stand
from an office table.

1161
01:08:26,503 --> 01:08:27,675
That means the one who sent the bomb"

1162
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:28,976
..isn't a professional bomb-maker.

1163
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:31,852
The tightness of
this tape on the pens..

1164
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,550
..suggest that the person is strong.

1165
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:35,889
And the writing suggests"

1166
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:38,318
..that his Hindi isn't
as good as yours, CD.

1167
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:41,394
We've hit jackpot, CD.

1168
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,626
Get ready to share the loot.

1169
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,130
What?

1170
01:08:45,188 --> 01:08:47,429
Are you talking about
sharing the real bomb?

1171
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,036
If you had shot this
arrow in the Olympics“.

1172
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:53,865
..you would've definitely
won the Gold.

1173
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:55,903
Thanks, Khalid.

1174
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,176
Keep the cheese and
the mouse trap ready.

1175
01:08:58,768 --> 01:09:00,645
He's close. - Close?

1176
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,378
Then take this threat
more seriously, STD.

1177
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,713
Don't worry, CD.

1178
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:06,712
This threat is going to lead us..

1179
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,718
..to the other end of the thread.

1180
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:12,417
Khalid, any help from
Anuj's post-mortem report?

1181
01:09:13,016 --> 01:09:14,552
There's been a shocking revelation.

1182
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,323
Mahendra Pratap and Anuj's..

1183
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:19,090
"time of
death is almost same.

1184
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:23,629
Oh...maybe the gardener's
ghost killed them both.

1185
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:27,073
But I feel Anuj killed
Mahendra Pratap first"

1186
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,666
..and then someone killed Anuj.

1187
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,478
Possible.

1188
01:09:31,735 --> 01:09:32,839
And it's also possible that..

1189
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,876
"someone killed Mahendra
Pratap upstairs"

1190
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:36,774
..and somebody else killed Anuj.

1191
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:40,712
Possible.

1192
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,380
We missed one point.

1193
01:09:42,579 --> 01:09:44,889
Maybe that person who was sending
the threats killed both.

1194
01:09:44,981 --> 01:09:46,051
Not possible.

1195
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:48,088
Why?

1196
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,796
Two different places
at the same time..

1197
01:09:50,887 --> 01:09:54,562
"two different victims, two killers.

1198
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:56,697
Two necks, two attacks.

1199
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:58,095
Different methods.

1200
01:09:58,461 --> 01:10:00,600
Anuj's killer is heartless.

1201
01:10:01,164 --> 01:10:04,043
Mahendra Pratap Singh's
killer isn't that brutal.

1202
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:05,912
The person sending the threats..

1203
01:10:06,002 --> 01:10:07,072
..wasn't spreading
rumors about the ghost..

1204
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:10,579
..because he knew that
Mahendra Pratap Singh..

1205
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:12,050
“Will be scared of threats,
not ghosts.

1206
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:14,882
One goal many strikers.

1207
01:10:15,278 --> 01:10:17,019
More than one person are
working on different things..

1208
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,725
"for different motives.

1209
01:10:18,815 --> 01:10:20,453
And someone's taking advantage of it.

1210
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:23,758
Now we will have to find out"

1211
01:10:24,354 --> 01:10:25,264
"who is doing exactly what.

1212
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:42,708
Hi.

1213
01:10:44,107 --> 01:10:46,087
Hi. - I am sorry, Dimpy.

1214
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:49,154
First your papa, then Anuj.

1215
01:10:50,313 --> 01:10:51,383
I can understand what
you're going through.

1216
01:10:51,481 --> 01:10:53,552
But I am a little short of sentiments.

1217
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,722
I just do not know how to express.

1218
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:00,590
It's okay, Samrat.
Thanks for your concern.

1219
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:08,507
But honestly, I don't know
why am I not sad about Anuj..

1220
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:10,269
"like I should be"

1221
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:15,842
But yes, I miss papa.

1222
01:11:19,175 --> 01:11:20,347
Your papa must have been proud..

1223
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:21,786
"to have a daughter like you.

1224
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:25,715
Thanks.

1225
01:11:26,049 --> 01:11:27,756
I am sorry for changing
the subject matter.

1226
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:29,757
But I don't see the driver Hari
around these days.

1227
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,755
Earlier he would always keep giving..

1228
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:33,795
“Live performances
of his mimicry. - Yes.

1229
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:36,536
I noted that too.

1230
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,501
He's been upset since
papa passed away.

1231
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,267
And he was saying that"

1232
01:11:41,364 --> 01:11:43,776
...he'll leave his job as soon
as the police investigation is over.

1233
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:46,444
What? - Yes.

1234
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:47,708
I want to meet him now.

1235
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:49,139
Right now.

1236
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:53,816
I'll call him.

1237
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,523
Hello.
- Hari, where are you?

1238
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:03,553
Sorry, madam. Since I had no work,
I came to see a friend.

1239
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,428
I'll be back in an hour or two.

1240
01:12:05,555 --> 01:12:06,431
Okay.

1241
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:07,763
Come back soon. - Okay, madam.

1242
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:12,269
Tail means the person sending
the threats will attack again.

1243
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:14,475
Heads means the threats are a fake.

1244
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:15,702
That's the point.

1245
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:20,337
I wish I had the same
coin Jai had in 'Sho
ay'.

1246
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,448
Anyways, God bless me.

1247
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,612
Stop. Stop.

1248
01:12:32,148 --> 01:12:33,218
Tail.

1249
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:34,653
That means attack.

1250
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:54,913
Everything looks blurred.

1251
01:12:55,271 --> 01:12:57,182
There are clouds all around.

1252
01:12:57,774 --> 01:12:58,912
That means I am dead!

1253
01:12:59,909 --> 01:13:01,388
That means I am dead!

1254
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:04,382
You're alive, CD. Get up.

1255
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:07,494
I am so sorry, Mr. Chakradhar.

1256
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,923
I apologize on behalf of Divya.

1257
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:14,559
You see...as a child,
Divya saw her mother commit suicide.

1258
01:13:15,158 --> 01:13:17,502
Since then she's a
bit mentally disturbed.

1259
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,138
She gets violent whenever
she gets the fits.

1260
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,230
Otherwise...she's quite calm.

1261
01:13:21,464 --> 01:13:23,034
Chakradhar ji is absolutely fine.

1262
01:13:23,466 --> 01:13:24,843
Please take care of Divya.

1263
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:28,472
If you need anything,
please don't hesitate to ask.

1264
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:30,140
For sure.

1265
01:13:31,274 --> 01:13:32,446
Take care.

1266
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:53,234
I am sure...that mental Divya killed
Mahendra Pratap and Anuj.

1267
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:55,139
I swear on my show.

1268
01:13:56,132 --> 01:13:58,840
I can never forget
those blood filled eyes.

1269
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:02,510
CD, nightmares are
meant to be forgotten.

1270
01:14:02,839 --> 01:14:05,319
Get some rest. I'll be right back.

1271
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:06,847
From where?

1272
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:09,754
I want to see Hari's
mimicry before he flees.

1273
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:12,192
His desire of becoming
rich in a short time..

1274
01:14:12,248 --> 01:14:13,852
..has got me thinking.

1275
01:14:32,769 --> 01:14:34,874
Hari isn't planning
to stay here too long.

1276
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,885
The empty hangers suggest"

1277
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:40,677
"that he's packed
his bags to leave soon.

1278
01:14:58,461 --> 01:14:59,906
Here's his train ticket for tomorrow.

1279
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:01,899
Hari's leaving for Mumbai tomorrow.

1280
01:15:02,432 --> 01:15:05,242
But why did he suddenly
plan on leaving?

1281
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:08,239
Tension, CD. Tension.

1282
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,451
Dust on the remote.

1283
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:14,552
That means film buff Hari..

1284
01:15:14,577 --> 01:15:17,319
..didn't touch the remote
after Mahendra Pratap's death.

1285
01:15:21,784 --> 01:15:23,491
But Hari did come to his room.

1286
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,566
Because there's no dust
on the light board switch.

1287
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:32,272
Mr. Chakradhar Pandey,

1288
01:15:32,829 --> 01:15:33,807
would you like some cold waten.

1289
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,809
"from an earthen pot in this
cold weather of Shimla.

1290
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:39,476
No. I am not crazy. - Hari isn't too.

1291
01:15:40,303 --> 01:15:41,509
I am sure.

1292
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:53,252
So much money?

1293
01:15:53,349 --> 01:15:54,760
Where did Hari get it from?

1294
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:35,430
Don't kill me. - CD!

1295
01:16:35,491 --> 01:16:36,492
I am from Mumbai.

1296
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:37,867
CD! - Please don't kill me.

1297
01:16:38,161 --> 01:16:40,539
CD! - I am dead. I am dead!

1298
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:42,265
You have 2 minutes.

1299
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:45,277
Not to make instant noodles,
but to come with me.

1300
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:46,836
Get up. - Where?

1301
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:47,738
To see Hari.

1302
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,347
What's your name? - Devika Kumari.

1303
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,328
Case of hit and run.

1304
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,288
The accident took place yesterday"

1305
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:06,992
..and the villagers
noticed the body today.

1306
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:34,250
Death is a beautiful
conclusion of life“.

1307
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,863
..but my conclusion
is that, this isn't an accident.

1308
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:38,926
This is a murder. - What?

1309
01:17:39,555 --> 01:17:40,829
Are you sure?

1310
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:42,500
I love to be sure.

1311
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:44,538
It's natural that last evening"

1312
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:48,400
..Hari didn't come to this
secluded spot for an evening walk.

1313
01:17:48,798 --> 01:17:51,404
Someone must have called
him here for some work.

1314
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:53,542
And yesterday evening at around <i>7</i> pm..

1315
01:17:53,803 --> 01:17:56,443
..Hari was standing
under this bus stop..

1316
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:58,246
..waiting for that person.

1317
01:17:58,908 --> 01:18:01,013
When he saw that person's
car approaching..

1318
01:18:01,077 --> 01:18:04,547
..Hari came on the road
and waved at the car to stop.

1319
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:10,086
But when the car didn't stop Hari ran.

1320
01:18:31,774 --> 01:18:34,084
We're dealing with a
very cunning criminal, CD.

1321
01:18:35,244 --> 01:18:36,245
Damn it.

1322
01:18:37,346 --> 01:18:39,485
He's always one step ahead of me.

1323
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:50,331
Samrat...

1324
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:51,494
Samrat!

1325
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:55,803
Hi, good morning.

1326
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:57,905
Where are you coming from,
this early in the morning?

1327
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:02,343
Hari's been murdered. - What?

1328
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,679
Whomwho killed him? - You..

1329
01:19:08,878 --> 01:19:10,016
You started jogging recently?

1330
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,527
I have been jogging for years.

1331
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:20,224
But who do you think
committed the murder?

1332
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:22,734
The same person who killed
Mahendra Pratap Singh.

1333
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:28,507
But you said you're going
to expose the murderer soon.

1334
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:30,174
That's why he killed Hari.

1335
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:35,181
Okay. . bye-

1336
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,614
BYE, bye, see you.

1337
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:40,919
Lucknow City College.

1338
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:42,887
Which batch, Mrs. Narayani?

1339
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:49,887
Actually. . .I can't remember.

1340
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:52,928
I think it was the early 70's.

1341
01:19:54,557 --> 01:19:55,558
Why?

1342
01:19:55,691 --> 01:19:57,932
Mahendra Pratap was in the
same college during the same period.

1343
01:19:58,694 --> 01:20:00,605
Were you two batch mates? - No, no.

1344
01:20:01,197 --> 01:20:04,337
Actually. . .I can't remember.

1345
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,902
Honestly, I really can't remember.

1346
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:08,079
Oh, I am sorry.
I completely forgot.

1347
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:13,213
You told me that you
two met just recently.

1348
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:16,216
BYE. Bye.

1349
01:20:20,016 --> 01:20:21,723
What were you trying to find out, STD?

1350
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:23,962
CD, give me your mobile phone. - Here.

1351
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,091
Why? Does your mobile
have network problem?

1352
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:29,792
CD, you're forgetting
the rules of Samratism.

1353
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:32,097
Before finding someone"

1354
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:34,671
..you need to hide yourself.
- Yes.

1355
01:20:34,764 --> 01:20:36,072
Wait and watch.

1356
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,511
When the time comes... we'll
reap the rewards..

1357
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:40,975
..and then I will answer
the stupidest of your questions.

1358
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:42,515
Let me know when you get a reply.

1359
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:04,998
Someone came into this
room precisely 2 minutes ago.

1360
01:21:05,928 --> 01:21:07,908
And searched this place foolishly.

1361
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:09,901
Here?

1362
01:21:10,766 --> 01:21:11,540
Who could it be?

1363
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,138
We'll find that out.

1364
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:16,206
But right now I am thinking
about the one we just met.

1365
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,152
Mrs. Narayani. - Yes.

1366
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,183
Why did she lie?

1367
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,049
What is she hiding?

1368
01:21:23,145 --> 01:21:25,455
An old friendship...or enmity.

1369
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:28,494
That means at this age Mr. Kishore"

1370
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:31,532
“will be single, ready to mingle.

1371
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,667
What do you mean? - That's the point.

1372
01:21:34,924 --> 01:21:40,806
Every person you
suspect, lands up dead.

1373
01:21:41,297 --> 01:21:43,243
First Anuj, then Hari..

1374
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:45,745
..and now, poor Mrs. Narayani.

1375
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:53,785
This is the same
kid's jumbled up ABCD.

1376
01:21:59,749 --> 01:22:01,092
Yes!!! Yes!!!

1377
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:02,628
Yes, CD, I've nailed it!

1378
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:04,796
I sent a message in code.

1379
01:22:04,887 --> 01:22:05,957
The game of hide and seek is over.

1380
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:07,127
When and where do we meet?

1381
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:08,660
And this is the reply.

1382
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,131
Tomorrow morning at 6,
Jogger's park, last bench.

1383
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:12,663
And he's the one"

1384
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,331
"who used to send
threats to Mahendra Pratap?

1385
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:15,337
Yes.

1386
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:19,009
And you sent him my number? - Yes.

1387
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,005
Are you my friend or foe?

1388
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:23,476
As soon as I return to Mumbai,
I'll change this number.

1389
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:27,486
CD...if you change nothing,
nothing will change.

1390
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:31,686
And anywaymhe won't
call you from Tihar Jail.

1391
01:22:32,548 --> 01:22:35,392
For now let's call Khalid
and call him also tomorrow morning..

1392
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:39,525
"completely prepared.

1393
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:06,423
Khalid, hope you have a good aim...?

1394
01:23:06,749 --> 01:23:10,060
IfI shoot someone's eye,
his ear will not come to know.

1395
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:12,090
Okay, then it's fine.

1396
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,589
What do you know?

1397
01:23:38,714 --> 01:23:42,992
You're good at jogging,
but you can't run very far.

1398
01:23:45,421 --> 01:23:50,063
You? - Yes, me.

1399
01:23:51,093 --> 01:23:52,436
Who is it?

1400
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:55,138
I hope he doesn't attack STD.

1401
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:56,498
Take a seat.

1402
01:23:59,935 --> 01:24:01,505
World's most lovable crime.

1403
01:24:02,004 --> 01:24:04,280
Steal someone's peace and slumber.

1404
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:06,411
First threats,
then rumors about ghosts.

1405
01:24:06,809 --> 01:24:10,018
With a hope that the
man dies of a cardiac arrest.

1406
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:11,915
But when that didn't happen"

1407
01:24:12,014 --> 01:24:14,426
..you personally transported Mr.
Mahendra Pratap"

1408
01:24:14,517 --> 01:24:16,428
"to the Eden Gardens. - What?

1409
01:24:17,186 --> 01:24:18,824
I recognised you in Mr.
Mahendra Pratap's..

1410
01:24:18,921 --> 01:24:20,559
"college group photo.

1411
01:24:21,657 --> 01:24:25,833
And then your lie
solidified my suspicion.

1412
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:28,466
Why did you kill him?

1413
01:24:28,497 --> 01:24:29,999
I didn't kill him.

1414
01:24:30,165 --> 01:24:32,008
Honestly" - Whether the truth
is beautiful or not..

1415
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,547
..it's consequences are.

1416
01:24:35,137 --> 01:24:36,548
Please speak the truth.

1417
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:40,049
I never imagined
that the return gift..

1418
01:24:40,376 --> 01:24:43,448
..of a prank played years
ago would be so dreadful.

1419
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:44,580
Hello.

1420
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:47,383
Thanks, mama.

1421
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:50,430
But there's still two minutes to 12.

1422
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:51,924
Hello.

1423
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,088
Hello.

1424
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:27,065
Happy birthday to you!

1425
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:30,594
Happy birthday to you!

1426
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:37,042
That was Mahendra's idea.

1427
01:25:37,533 --> 01:25:38,978
But I broke my leg.

1428
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,407
Mahendra apologized to
me many times for that prank.

1429
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:45,376
I wanted to scare Mahendra"

1430
01:25:45,741 --> 01:25:47,618
"just like he scared me.

1431
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:54,559
After college...we
met just two months ago.

1432
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,426
Luckily, I recognized him..

1433
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:59,189
"but he didn't recognize me.

1434
01:26:00,456 --> 01:26:02,094
And taking advantage of this"

1435
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:04,100
..I started sending him those emails.

1436
01:26:05,861 --> 01:26:09,434
Mahendra used code letters in college.

1437
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,167
I thought he'll understand.

1438
01:26:13,035 --> 01:26:14,446
But that didn't happen.

1439
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:17,477
Then those ghostly events started.

1440
01:26:17,806 --> 01:26:20,082
And I was enjoying
the fear on his face.

1441
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:23,080
My small revenge was
about to get completed"

1442
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:24,755
..on his 60th birthday.

1443
01:26:25,381 --> 01:26:26,519
When I was going to gift him..

1444
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:29,859
..that college group
photo and tell him the truth.

1445
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:33,926
But...before that...

1446
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:38,026
You know what...happened then...

1447
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:42,537
The next night I did go to his room"

1448
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:44,469
"to delete those mails.

1449
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,579
But my bad luck, the police had
already taken his laptop into custody.

1450
01:26:58,647 --> 01:27:02,117
Samrat, I haven't
shared all this with anyone"

1451
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,163
"except for you.

1452
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:06,595
Not even with my husband.

1453
01:27:07,122 --> 01:27:13,073
If you believe me,
then please don't tell anyone.

1454
01:27:14,496 --> 01:27:16,237
Please let it all be a secret.

1455
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:19,338
My job is to unravel secrets.

1456
01:27:20,269 --> 01:27:21,976
But in your case, until and unless"

1457
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:26,514
"there's a really big reason,
I will keep it under wraps.

1458
01:27:28,143 --> 01:27:29,178
Promise.

1459
01:27:29,478 --> 01:27:30,548
Thank you.

1460
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,525
By the way who came to see you?

1461
01:27:33,882 --> 01:27:36,089
You can say that he has
no connection with this case.

1462
01:27:36,552 --> 01:27:38,054
CD there was a point in your point.

1463
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:40,555
The jumbled ABCD
was actually the prank of a kid.

1464
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,501
That's the point.

1465
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:45,003
If you had recognized
my talent earlier..

1466
01:27:45,094 --> 01:27:47,040
..you wouldn't have wasted 4 days.

1467
01:27:47,296 --> 01:27:49,401
I am sorry, CD. I made a mistake.

1468
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:51,509
But now rack your brains..

1469
01:27:51,533 --> 01:27:54,639
..and find out who's
behind the three bigger pranks.

1470
01:27:55,137 --> 01:27:57,674
Let's catch and send
him to hell. - Okay.

1471
01:28:01,043 --> 01:28:01,680
Hello.

1472
01:28:02,411 --> 01:28:03,116
Yes. Yes.

1473
01:28:03,545 --> 01:28:05,115
Saiju, don't worry.

1474
01:28:05,547 --> 01:28:06,924
But, brothen.
- This time I'll get you a big story.

1475
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:08,790
I've to go. I don't have time.

1476
01:28:08,884 --> 01:28:11,455
No, no, telecast this
episode with an old story.

1477
01:28:11,853 --> 01:28:12,854
And listen...clear everyone's cheque.

1478
01:28:13,188 --> 01:28:14,826
Mistress in distress.

1479
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:16,158
Any problem?

1480
01:28:16,825 --> 01:28:19,328
Actually, I've to attend
an important art exhibition.

1481
01:28:19,428 --> 01:28:20,964
And there's not a single car at home.

1482
01:28:21,263 --> 01:28:22,970
So...I am stuck.

1483
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:24,971
So take my car. - Oh, no, no, no.

1484
01:28:25,267 --> 01:28:27,144
I've called up brother
and asked him to send a car.

1485
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:29,504
Formalities are good
between strangers.

1486
01:28:29,872 --> 01:28:31,977
But we know each other a bit now.

1487
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,144
Right?

1488
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:36,685
Right. Thanks.

1489
01:28:54,096 --> 01:28:56,599
"This is a game of ABC..."

1490
01:28:57,099 --> 01:28:58,806
"Don't take your foot off A.."

1491
01:28:58,867 --> 01:29:00,540
"..and don't touch B and C."

1492
01:29:01,236 --> 01:29:06,083
"If the arrow reduces to 50,
you'll be responsible for a 'boom' .."

1493
01:29:08,877 --> 01:29:09,947
A Puzzle?

1494
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:14,252
What does it mean?

1495
01:29:14,616 --> 01:29:15,594
What does it mean?

1496
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:17,256
What's he trying to say?

1497
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,627
What does A B C mean?

1498
01:29:20,656 --> 01:29:21,794
Don't take your foot off A?

1499
01:29:22,391 --> 01:29:23,734
What we do with the foot?

1500
01:29:24,493 --> 01:29:25,665
Don't touch B and C.

1501
01:29:26,128 --> 01:29:27,106
B and C means?

1502
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:28,430
Come on, Samrat.

1503
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:29,931
What does it mean?

1504
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:31,099
Come on, Samrat.

1505
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:32,167
Focus.

1506
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:33,676
What does it mean?

1507
01:29:34,903 --> 01:29:35,677
ABC

1508
01:29:36,305 --> 01:29:37,682
Come on, Samrat.

1509
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,042
Driving.

1510
01:29:41,677 --> 01:29:42,985
First lesson of driving.

1511
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,052
ABC means Accelerator,
Brake and Clutch.

1512
01:29:46,615 --> 01:29:47,923
Don't take your foot
off the accelerator.

1513
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:49,760
Don't touch the brake and clutch.

1514
01:29:50,519 --> 01:29:51,657
Arrow points to the speedometer.

1515
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:53,596
If the speed reduces to 50...boom!

1516
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:55,866
The bomb will explode.

1517
01:29:58,927 --> 01:29:59,803
Catch it.

1518
01:30:02,598 --> 01:30:03,303
Hello.

1519
01:30:03,632 --> 01:30:04,872
Dimpy, Samrat. Where are you?

1520
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,474
I am about to reach Mall Road.

1521
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:08,143
Okay.

1522
01:30:08,203 --> 01:30:09,944
Hold your nerves and
listen to me carefully.

1523
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,214
Don't reduce the car
speed to 50 or less.

1524
01:30:13,809 --> 01:30:14,719
But Why?

1525
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:16,684
There's a bomb in the car. - What?

1526
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:17,853
Dimpy, don't worry.

1527
01:30:17,946 --> 01:30:19,448
Do you trust me? - Yes, but"

1528
01:30:19,548 --> 01:30:21,027
Dimpy, do as I say.

1529
01:30:21,483 --> 01:30:22,985
Just don't reduce the
speed.

1530
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:24,889
Okay.

1531
01:31:05,527 --> 01:31:06,437
S**t.

1532
01:31:13,535 --> 01:31:14,536
Come on, Samrat focus.

1533
01:31:14,836 --> 01:31:15,906
Dimpy's car will cross Mall Road"

1534
01:31:16,004 --> 01:31:17,415
<i>“and head towards Banjo“ Cross road.</i>

1535
01:31:17,773 --> 01:31:19,377
If the car's travelling at 60..

1536
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:20,509
..then it will take
3 minutes to get there.

1537
01:31:20,876 --> 01:31:21,854
IfI take the Civil Court road"

1538
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:23,286
..then it will take me the same time.

1539
01:31:23,612 --> 01:31:24,955
But ifI take the Old Market route..

1540
01:31:25,013 --> 01:31:26,151
..then I might get there soonen.

1541
01:31:30,385 --> 01:31:31,090
Mister, what are you doing?

1542
01:31:31,386 --> 01:31:32,296
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

1543
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:35,597
Hey"

1544
01:31:44,299 --> 01:31:45,004
Mister..

1545
01:32:04,686 --> 01:32:06,927
Who's that?
Stop.

1546
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:09,789
Oh, my God!

1547
01:33:18,226 --> 01:33:19,296
Samrat.

1548
01:33:24,466 --> 01:33:25,240
Hi.

1549
01:33:25,467 --> 01:33:26,241
All well?

1550
01:33:29,504 --> 01:33:30,278
Okay.

1551
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:34,677
Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

1552
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:37,012
Alright.

1553
01:33:37,479 --> 01:33:38,719
Alright.

1554
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:40,485
Let's jump.

1555
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:30,271
Samrat.

1556
01:34:31,533 --> 01:34:33,274
Samrat. Thank you so much.

1557
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:34,746
I am really obliged.

1558
01:34:35,570 --> 01:34:36,571
Are you okay?

1559
01:34:37,072 --> 01:34:38,244
Look, Mr. Sanjay.. - Doctor.

1560
01:34:39,074 --> 01:34:40,382
Nothing to worry about.

1561
01:34:40,609 --> 01:34:42,350
She was unconscious due to the shock.

1562
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:43,714
There are few minor injuries.

1563
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:45,052
I've given her first aid.

1564
01:34:46,348 --> 01:34:47,349
Thank you, doctor.

1565
01:34:47,549 --> 01:34:49,119
When can we take Dimpy home?

1566
01:34:49,384 --> 01:34:50,590
You can take her home now.

1567
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:53,831
STD... STD...

1568
01:34:54,723 --> 01:34:56,600
How did this happen?
Are you okay?

1569
01:34:56,658 --> 01:34:58,365
He's more restless than us, CD.

1570
01:35:00,128 --> 01:35:01,198
Yes, Khalid, I am fine.

1571
01:35:01,629 --> 01:35:02,505
I've texted you a number.

1572
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:03,838
Just find out whom does it belong to.

1573
01:35:04,332 --> 01:35:07,245
Fine, you'll have all
the details by tomorrow morning.

1574
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:09,571
Okay.

1575
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:11,580
We just need to wait
for tomorrow morning.

1576
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,145
Tomorrow's dawn will. .

1577
01:35:13,441 --> 01:35:15,580
.. clear out all the
darkness off this case.

1578
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:17,384
What a story!

1579
01:35:17,813 --> 01:35:19,383
Murderer plants bomb in the car.

1580
01:35:19,814 --> 01:35:21,122
Beautiful girl in the car.

1581
01:35:21,416 --> 01:35:25,592
Samrat risks his life to save"

1582
01:35:26,488 --> 01:35:27,592
Coming.

1583
01:35:34,329 --> 01:35:35,637
There's no one.

1584
01:35:36,965 --> 01:35:38,501
Look down.

1585
01:35:39,968 --> 01:35:43,677
B...B...Bomb..

1586
01:35:44,172 --> 01:35:45,207
Chakradharji...

1587
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,078
Don't touch it. Don't go so close.

1588
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:49,782
B...B...Bomb..

1589
01:35:50,011 --> 01:35:51,354
No...don't open it.

1590
01:35:51,613 --> 01:35:53,251
Look, I am elder to you.

1591
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:54,651
Listen to me.

1592
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:56,319
Stop, Samrat.

1593
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:04,799
What you during, sir?

1594
01:36:06,728 --> 01:36:07,729
Yoga.

1595
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:10,138
Bomb-phat asan.

1596
01:36:40,195 --> 01:36:45,195
"How do I...thank you now?"

1597
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:56,740
"How do I...thank you now?"

1598
01:37:03,117 --> 01:37:08,117
"How do I...repay your love."

1599
01:37:14,396 --> 01:37:20,108
"Your silence conveyed everything."

1600
01:37:20,535 --> 01:37:25,678
"Your generous heart swept me away."

1601
01:37:26,074 --> 01:37:35,620
"I'm beginning to
trust you completely."

1602
01:37:37,419 --> 01:37:42,419
"I feel safe around you...says my soul."

1603
01:37:48,763 --> 01:37:58,081
"How do I...thank you now?"

1604
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:00,117
Thanks for the gift.

1605
01:38:01,276 --> 01:38:02,755
Thanks to you, Samrat.

1606
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:07,751
I mean if you..
I mean" - You're welcome.

1607
01:38:10,018 --> 01:38:11,520
But I was only saving my life.

1608
01:38:14,689 --> 01:38:17,499
Actually, the bomb was in my car..

1609
01:38:17,525 --> 01:38:18,833
..so I was the target.

1610
01:38:19,494 --> 01:38:21,667
You were going to
unintentionally die my death.

1611
01:38:24,299 --> 01:38:26,472
I would've done it
intentionally as well.

1612
01:38:28,302 --> 01:38:32,011
What? - Forget it.

1613
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:37,981
Another strange thing.

1614
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:40,086
The phone's registered
in the name of the dead gardener..

1615
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:43,089
"who was fired from
the job for stealing.

1616
01:38:44,018 --> 01:38:45,122
The phone's switched off.

1617
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:48,131
But it was switched on
a while ago in Mahendra Mansion.

1618
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:49,561
Good morning, sir.

1619
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:53,497
That means someone has
untied the knot Belgium Baba tied.

1620
01:38:53,862 --> 01:38:55,136
The gardener's ghost is back.

1621
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:56,668
Another shocking news.

1622
01:38:57,132 --> 01:39:00,045
From the phone's call
history we've learnt that..

1623
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:02,539
..that it's been frequently
calling Satyadev Baba.

1624
01:39:03,137 --> 01:39:04,707
That means the ghost has made"

1625
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,680
..an arrangement with the Baba.

1626
01:39:07,075 --> 01:39:07,849
Hotline.

1627
01:39:08,343 --> 01:39:09,617
Baba has just returned from Belgium.

1628
01:39:10,545 --> 01:39:11,853
He has a small hermitage close-by.

1629
01:39:26,995 --> 01:39:29,236
He's an adopted child? Sure?

1630
01:39:29,497 --> 01:39:30,271
Glory to thee!

1631
01:39:31,132 --> 01:39:32,543
Glory to thee!

1632
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:35,614
Baba's waiting for you.

1633
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:43,648
Baba!

1634
01:39:48,883 --> 01:39:49,987
<i>Satyadev Babe.</i>

1635
01:39:57,992 --> 01:39:59,130
Oh, God!

1636
01:39:59,427 --> 01:40:00,770
Baba's closed for business.

1637
01:40:09,203 --> 01:40:10,682
It's the same dead gardener's number.

1638
01:40:12,073 --> 01:40:14,075
CD, talk to him in Baba's voice.

1639
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:15,085
Talk to a ghost!

1640
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:16,746
Say Glory to thee... talk to him.

1641
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:17,989
Okay.

1642
01:40:20,448 --> 01:40:21,688
Glory to thee...

1643
01:40:22,150 --> 01:40:23,390
Glory to thee...

1644
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:24,552
Failure to thee.

1645
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:26,022
Failure to thee.

1646
01:40:26,454 --> 01:40:27,558
Greetings, Baba.

1647
01:40:28,156 --> 01:40:31,103
I am really sad to
know that you're dead.

1648
01:40:32,093 --> 01:40:33,663
CD, give the phone to Samrat.

1649
01:40:37,365 --> 01:40:38,309
Samrat.

1650
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:50,715
I am coming.

1651
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:54,621
Who was it?
- What was he saying?

1652
01:40:54,983 --> 01:40:56,519
Where are you going?
- Listen.

1653
01:40:56,584 --> 01:40:57,585
Samrat.

1654
01:40:58,119 --> 01:40:59,655
Questions! Questions! More questions!

1655
01:40:59,987 --> 01:41:00,761
I am just fed up.

1656
01:41:01,155 --> 01:41:01,758
Wait for my call.

1657
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:03,764
Wait.
- Don't go alone.

1658
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:04,762
Where are you going?

1659
01:41:04,992 --> 01:41:06,096
We're coming along.
Samrat.

1660
01:41:07,128 --> 01:41:08,163
Samrat.

1661
01:41:08,696 --> 01:41:10,198
Stop. Where are you going without me?

1662
01:41:10,298 --> 01:41:11,276
Please listen to me.

1663
01:41:11,465 --> 01:41:12,273
Samrat.

1664
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:13,277
Samrat.

1665
01:41:13,468 --> 01:41:14,446
Samrat.

1666
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:18,945
Where did he go?
- Maybe to get beaten up.

1667
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:20,946
What?

1668
01:41:51,873 --> 01:41:54,183
Deepak (Lamp) can
clear the darkness"

1669
01:41:54,976 --> 01:41:56,182
..or burn down the house.

1670
01:41:59,547 --> 01:42:02,926
I tried to explain to you...
to stay away from this fire.

1671
01:42:03,251 --> 01:42:05,390
I've a different way
to understand and explain.

1672
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:07,490
Why didn't you kill
me before I got to the Baba?

1673
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:10,595
That would've ended the story, STD.

1674
01:42:11,259 --> 01:42:13,830
The real fun is in agony.

1675
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,866
Won't you show me whethen.

1676
01:42:17,298 --> 01:42:19,778
..you're just as strong
as you are intelligent.

1677
01:42:20,435 --> 01:42:21,778
And if you're scared"

1678
01:42:22,003 --> 01:42:23,607
..then that's the way out.

1679
01:42:25,106 --> 01:42:26,483
Samrat knows his way.

1680
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:33,317
Not bad.

1681
01:42:34,015 --> 01:42:36,757
But you will 
ose...this time.

1682
01:42:37,385 --> 01:42:38,796
Winning is my nature, Deepak.

1683
01:42:39,053 --> 01:42:41,294
My challenge at Mahendra
Pratap's memorial scared you.

1684
01:42:41,389 --> 01:42:43,130
And due to that fear
you started losing.

1685
01:42:44,125 --> 01:42:45,604
By planting a fake bomb in my car.

1686
01:42:51,633 --> 01:42:53,544
What? - Yes.

1687
01:42:53,968 --> 01:42:54,844
The watch on the bomb"

1688
01:42:54,902 --> 01:42:56,006
..was from the pen
stand in your office.

1689
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:58,882
I also saw the offer letter
from Dhanraj Group of Companies.

1690
01:42:59,374 --> 01:43:00,876
Refusing an offer
from such a big company"

1691
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:02,677
"to continue working
for Mahendra Pratap"

1692
01:43:02,811 --> 01:43:04,688
"wasn't for loyalty, but for revenge.

1693
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:07,250
Friends and foe never leave you alone.

1694
01:43:08,549 --> 01:43:09,892
And you're no friend.

1695
01:43:27,802 --> 01:43:29,804
Today morning I also
received news from Bengaluru.

1696
01:43:30,138 --> 01:43:31,378
'He's an adopted child.'

1697
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:34,315
And then it wasn't difficult to find..

1698
01:43:34,375 --> 01:43:35,854
...that you're the kid whose family“.

1699
01:43:35,943 --> 01:43:37,547
"Mahendra Pratap Singh
had killed years ago"

1700
01:43:37,645 --> 01:43:38,953
..and you came here for revenge.

1701
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,953
'There was one body missing.'

1702
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:43,722
'His 7 year old son.'

1703
01:43:46,587 --> 01:43:50,296
I would've come to you
even if you hadn't called.

1704
01:43:50,992 --> 01:43:52,630
I came here to kill Mahendra Pratap.

1705
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:53,665
Kill him by ruining him.

1706
01:43:53,961 --> 01:43:55,099
I was looking for
the right opportunity.

1707
01:43:55,163 --> 01:43:56,608
And as soon as I learnt
about the gardenen.

1708
01:43:56,664 --> 01:43:57,972
..I took advantage.

1709
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:10,480
Then I hired a horticulturist.

1710
01:44:11,813 --> 01:44:13,053
Made him wither the garden.

1711
01:44:16,017 --> 01:44:17,496
And manipulated the
forensic analysis.

1712
01:44:17,552 --> 01:44:19,156
And then tampered
the CCTV footages"

1713
01:44:19,453 --> 01:44:21,490
..and spread the rumor about a ghost.

1714
01:44:24,359 --> 01:44:27,101
Then you introduced that
fake baba to Mahendra Pratap.

1715
01:44:27,795 --> 01:44:28,796
So that he pretends
to drive away the ghost..

1716
01:44:28,863 --> 01:44:30,536
..and Mahendra Pratap
develops faith in him.

1717
01:44:30,798 --> 01:44:32,277
So that you can ruin his business"

1718
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:34,643
..in the name of stars
and constellations.

1719
01:44:35,003 --> 01:44:36,004
Exactly.

1720
01:44:36,304 --> 01:44:37,942
Two days before the baba arrived..

1721
01:44:38,039 --> 01:44:39,575
..I asked the horticulturist
to stop putting the chemicals.

1722
01:44:39,874 --> 01:44:42,115
So that the garden turns green
again after the havan (chanting).

1723
01:44:42,843 --> 01:44:45,255
But your garden and
ghost idea flopped.

1724
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:49,459
Because Mahendra Pratap Singh
was scared of something else.

1725
01:44:50,518 --> 01:44:51,792
Mahendra had commited
many sins in his life“.

1726
01:44:52,019 --> 01:44:54,226
..and his guilt was
the reason of his fear.

1727
01:44:54,689 --> 01:44:56,862
If that rascal Anuj
hadn't interfered..

1728
01:44:56,957 --> 01:44:58,732
..then my plan would've
been successful.

1729
01:44:59,227 --> 01:45:01,400
Baba, everything's
going according to plan.

1730
01:45:02,363 --> 01:45:03,842
And after you drove
away the imaginary ghost"

1731
01:45:04,065 --> 01:45:05,840
"Mahendra Pratap
trusts you completely.

1732
01:45:07,234 --> 01:45:09,612
Here...the reward for your efforts.

1733
01:45:13,074 --> 01:45:14,815
Greetings, Baba. Greetings.

1734
01:45:15,543 --> 01:45:18,217
I came to seek your blessings.

1735
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:19,753
Glory to thee.

1736
01:45:20,014 --> 01:45:21,618
Glory to thee.

1737
01:45:30,691 --> 01:45:31,795
Hello.

1738
01:45:32,493 --> 01:45:37,306
Dimpy, I want to tell you
a secret related to your family.

1739
01:45:38,032 --> 01:45:39,409
No, no, not now.

1740
01:45:40,167 --> 01:45:41,578
I'll tell you when we meet.

1741
01:45:44,038 --> 01:45:48,783
Deepak, make me a
shareholder in your company.

1742
01:45:49,043 --> 01:45:51,785
How much do you want?
- For now, 2.5 million will do.

1743
01:45:52,413 --> 01:45:53,551
But keep your mouth shut!

1744
01:45:54,048 --> 01:45:55,083
Sure.

1745
01:46:02,123 --> 01:46:03,124
That loser.

1746
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:04,567
He was black mailing me! Me?

1747
01:46:05,225 --> 01:46:07,501
I thought I'll dump
his body after the party.

1748
01:46:07,995 --> 01:46:09,668
But Mahendra Pratap got murdered.

1749
01:46:12,433 --> 01:46:13,503
What?

1750
01:46:14,435 --> 01:46:15,573
Didn't you kill Mahendra Pratap?

1751
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:17,581
I'll regret this till I live.

1752
01:46:17,671 --> 01:46:18,843
I didn't want to kill him so easily"

1753
01:46:18,906 --> 01:46:21,045
..in fact, I wanted to ruin
him and torture him to death.

1754
01:46:21,409 --> 01:46:22,513
But that sinner washed his sins..

1755
01:46:22,543 --> 01:46:23,851
..by changing the will.

1756
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:53,945
Good kick.

1757
01:46:55,376 --> 01:46:57,947
Why did you have to kill your
crime partner that fake Baba?

1758
01:46:58,880 --> 01:46:59,950
He was on your side.

1759
01:47:03,784 --> 01:47:05,730
I thought I'll do one
good deed before I go.

1760
01:47:06,854 --> 01:47:08,856
There will be one less
burden off this planet.

1761
01:47:10,725 --> 01:47:11,703
I see.

1762
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,631
So finally, tell me
why did you kill Hari?

1763
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:17,534
I didn't kill him either.

1764
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:19,137
What would I gain..

1765
01:47:19,433 --> 01:47:20,434
.. by killing that
stupid mimicry artist?

1766
01:47:22,670 --> 01:47:24,411
I feel sad for him.

1767
01:47:27,141 --> 01:47:28,415
And I feel sad for you.

1768
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:41,065
After Mahendra Pratap's death"

1769
01:47:41,122 --> 01:47:42,567
..I've no motive to live.

1770
01:47:43,057 --> 01:47:46,664
And who better than you would know
how boring life is without a motive.

1771
01:47:49,196 --> 01:47:51,699
See...I won.

1772
01:48:10,217 --> 01:48:13,630
Those who live. . .win.

1773
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:21,969
Samrat.

1774
01:48:22,263 --> 01:48:24,971
Samrat. Are you fine?
- Are you okay.

1775
01:48:27,601 --> 01:48:28,477
Oh, God.

1776
01:48:28,536 --> 01:48:31,016
Everyone get down, quick.
- Yes, sir.

1777
01:48:32,539 --> 01:48:34,246
'Mahendra Pratap got murdered.'

1778
01:48:34,909 --> 01:48:37,185
'What would I gain by killing
that stupid mimicry artist?'

1779
01:48:39,547 --> 01:48:41,390
'Vijay Dinanath Chauhan.'

1780
01:48:41,682 --> 01:48:44,162
'If you're pushing your car,
then you're alive.'

1781
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:46,553
'I love you Anjali.'

1782
01:48:47,054 --> 01:48:48,556
'Car, bungalow, fame, fortune.'

1783
01:48:48,756 --> 01:48:50,167
'I want everything, sir. Everything.'

1784
01:48:50,491 --> 01:48:52,300
'But I am in a hurry, sir.'

1785
01:48:54,295 --> 01:48:55,797
'I'll be back in an hour or two.'

1786
01:48:56,197 --> 01:48:58,268
'Hari's leaving for Mumbai tomorrow.'

1787
01:48:58,833 --> 01:49:00,073
'Case of hit and run.'

1788
01:49:02,670 --> 01:49:04,877
Samrat, you fool!

1789
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:07,379
Everything was right
before your eyes..

1790
01:49:07,675 --> 01:49:09,416
..and you couldn't
understand anything.

1791
01:49:10,077 --> 01:49:12,455
How could you miss Hari?

1792
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,261
You're such a big fool.
- Who?

1793
01:49:16,951 --> 01:49:19,431
Who's a big fool, Samrat?
- Me, CD.

1794
01:49:19,653 --> 01:49:20,427
I am a big fool!

1795
01:49:20,921 --> 01:49:22,764
Puran kaka and Vijay, both
were telling the truth.

1796
01:49:23,123 --> 01:49:25,899
How can two opposite versions
be true at the same time?

1797
01:49:26,294 --> 01:49:28,797
When there's a third lie.

1798
01:49:29,297 --> 01:49:30,435
Third lie?

1799
01:49:31,365 --> 01:49:35,404
This story's going to
end where it started, CD.

1800
01:49:36,169 --> 01:49:38,012
Let's prove it.
- How?

1801
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:41,411
Mahendra Pratap Singh
will come himself"

1802
01:49:41,642 --> 01:49:42,643
"to name his murderer.

1803
01:49:43,043 --> 01:49:44,386
But he's"

1804
01:49:44,812 --> 01:49:46,382
Spirits come and go, CD.

1805
01:49:46,848 --> 01:49:47,883
Come on.

1806
01:49:56,557 --> 01:49:57,865
I am Vikramjeet.

1807
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,398
I am not some baba or tantric.

1808
01:50:02,696 --> 01:50:04,676
I am an astrophysicist.

1809
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:08,844
I've done extensive
research on planchette.

1810
01:50:10,904 --> 01:50:15,944
Planchette is one of the oldest
and scientific ways..

1811
01:50:16,677 --> 01:50:18,179
"to call a spirit.

1812
01:50:18,813 --> 01:50:22,192
To find the real killer..

1813
01:50:22,249 --> 01:50:25,594
"we're going to call
Mahendra Pratap's spirit.

1814
01:50:27,822 --> 01:50:32,328
In planchette, we need a medium.

1815
01:50:34,228 --> 01:50:37,801
And through that we talk to spirits.

1816
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:44,506
And today our medium will be Mr.
Chakradhar.

1817
01:50:50,711 --> 01:50:53,521
Now all of you close your eyes"

1818
01:50:54,215 --> 01:50:56,525
..and think about Mahendra Pratap.

1819
01:51:36,123 --> 01:51:41,436
Mr. Mahendra Pratapmare
you amongst us?

1820
01:51:48,903 --> 01:51:50,348
Yes.

1821
01:51:57,344 --> 01:52:01,383
If this is what you call
being present, then I am.

1822
01:52:02,282 --> 01:52:04,785
A man can die but once.

1823
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:08,066
Did your younger son Vijay kill you?

1824
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:15,397
He's my blood...

1825
01:52:15,830 --> 01:52:18,106
"but someone else
has my blood on his hands.

1826
01:52:18,599 --> 01:52:19,703
Who?

1827
01:52:19,967 --> 01:52:21,275
Who is it?

1828
01:52:46,894 --> 01:52:48,373
Divva?!

1829
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:53,374
Even this world doesn't believe it.

1830
01:52:55,635 --> 01:52:57,376
But yes...

1831
01:53:22,129 --> 01:53:23,608
What nonsense is this?

1832
01:53:24,131 --> 01:53:25,439
Divya didn't kill papa.

1833
01:53:26,133 --> 01:53:27,237
And that wasn't papa.

1834
01:53:29,937 --> 01:53:31,143
Come, sir.

1835
01:53:32,773 --> 01:53:35,276
I guess there's
some ritual going on here.

1836
01:53:35,643 --> 01:53:38,055
Sorry, but we had to come.

1837
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:42,021
We have an arrest warrant for Divya.

1838
01:53:42,516 --> 01:53:45,520
And we just found out"

1839
01:53:45,586 --> 01:53:48,760
..that the pillow used
to suffocate Mr. Mahendra..

1840
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:50,130
..had Divya's fingerprints.

1841
01:53:51,458 --> 01:53:53,460
And we also have statements"

1842
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:54,966
"from few guests at that party..

1843
01:53:55,062 --> 01:53:56,268
"who say that they saw Divya..

1844
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:58,275
..go into Mahedra Pratap's room"

1845
01:53:58,665 --> 01:54:00,303
"right before the murder.

1846
01:54:00,634 --> 01:54:04,172
Insp. Khalid, if it's about
fingerprints on the pillow"

1847
01:54:04,271 --> 01:54:06,182
"then it also has
Vijay's fingerprints.

1848
01:54:06,273 --> 01:54:08,310
But that doesn't mean he's the killer.

1849
01:54:08,542 --> 01:54:11,045
Sorry, we have enough proofs.

1850
01:54:11,678 --> 01:54:13,123
And as far as you're concerned.

1851
01:54:13,914 --> 01:54:15,291
You can prove it in the court.

1852
01:54:15,849 --> 01:54:18,193
You don't get it,
Divya can never do such a thing.

1853
01:54:18,585 --> 01:54:21,065
She has tried to do
something similar before.

1854
01:54:21,588 --> 01:54:23,124
She attacked CD.

1855
01:54:23,991 --> 01:54:25,026
That was a coincidence.

1856
01:54:25,125 --> 01:54:27,503
Coincidences don't occur every day,
Mr. Sanjay.

1857
01:54:27,594 --> 01:54:29,540
She has attacked the
servants of this house too.

1858
01:54:29,629 --> 01:54:30,699
Trust me, this is a lie.

1859
01:54:30,998 --> 01:54:31,703
Then what's the truth?

1860
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:33,705
The doctors suggested to
send her to a mental asylum“.

1861
01:54:33,967 --> 01:54:35,708
"but your love kept her here.

1862
01:54:35,936 --> 01:54:37,074
This is a conspiracy.

1863
01:54:37,171 --> 01:54:39,515
Divya can never do such a thing?
- Why can't she?

1864
01:54:40,374 --> 01:54:41,717
Divya's mental condition got worse"

1865
01:54:41,942 --> 01:54:43,512
"after she saw her
mother commit suicide.

1866
01:54:43,944 --> 01:54:45,514
She started hating her father.

1867
01:54:45,946 --> 01:54:47,721
On his 60th birthday,
when she had the fits again..

1868
01:54:47,948 --> 01:54:49,325
"she was out of control.

1869
01:54:49,416 --> 01:54:50,394
She then went to his room"

1870
01:54:50,451 --> 01:54:52,124
..and strangled him with a pillow.

1871
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:53,724
That's a lie.

1872
01:54:54,988 --> 01:54:56,695
Divya didn't hate papa.

1873
01:54:57,524 --> 01:54:59,731
And the fingerprints
on the pillow aren't Divya's.

1874
01:55:00,393 --> 01:55:01,736
They can't be Divya's fingerprints!

1875
01:55:01,996 --> 01:55:03,634
Absolutely right, Mr. Sanjay.

1876
01:55:03,997 --> 01:55:04,737
But how do you know"

1877
01:55:05,031 --> 01:55:06,738
"those weren't Divya's
fingerprints on the pillow?

1878
01:55:10,203 --> 01:55:11,273
I'll tell you...

1879
01:55:13,474 --> 01:55:16,045
Because while killing
Mahendra Pratap"

1880
01:55:16,310 --> 01:55:18,017
..you were wearing gloves!

1881
01:55:18,212 --> 01:55:19,885
You killed Mahendra Pratap!

1882
01:55:20,247 --> 01:55:22,784
You're the killer, Mr. Sanjay..!!
- Yes, yes!!

1883
01:55:22,883 --> 01:55:25,295
I killed him!

1884
01:55:27,087 --> 01:55:29,966
I hated him.

1885
01:55:33,193 --> 01:55:35,332
Truth is that light..

1886
01:55:35,596 --> 01:55:38,042
..which can be seen even before dawn.

1887
01:55:38,632 --> 01:55:41,203
Thank you, Khalid, for helping me.
- Pleasure.

1888
01:55:41,302 --> 01:55:43,339
And bravo,
sub-inspector Vikramjeet Singh..

1889
01:55:43,570 --> 01:55:44,913
..for your outstanding performance.
- Thank you.

1890
01:55:45,005 --> 01:55:46,348
CD, you're brilliant.

1891
01:55:47,007 --> 01:55:50,682
I had my doubts when
I saw the phone in it's place.

1892
01:55:51,111 --> 01:55:52,784
But my doubts were confirmed"

1893
01:55:52,879 --> 01:55:54,654
"when I kept a sample of mud..

1894
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:56,055
"from Hari's murder spot.

1895
01:55:56,116 --> 01:55:59,097
And I found the same
mud on your car's tires.

1896
01:56:01,355 --> 01:56:03,596
I was convinced, but confused too.

1897
01:56:03,857 --> 01:56:04,995
But when Deepak said
he has nothing to gain..

1898
01:56:05,058 --> 01:56:06,537
..by killing a mimicry
artist like Hari..

1899
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:08,369
..that's when I understood"

1900
01:56:08,428 --> 01:56:09,907
..that you have everything
to gain from it.

1901
01:56:12,532 --> 01:56:14,443
I had no other way to prove"

1902
01:56:14,535 --> 01:56:15,605
..that you are the murderer.

1903
01:56:16,270 --> 01:56:17,874
That's why I had to pick this option.

1904
01:56:29,516 --> 01:56:31,996
My mother committed
suicide because of my father.

1905
01:56:33,486 --> 01:56:36,558
He's responsible for
my sister's condition.

1906
01:56:40,293 --> 01:56:42,364
I hated him from the core of my heart.

1907
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:46,401
After coercing my mother
to committing suicide..

1908
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,446
..papa got married again.

1909
01:56:49,870 --> 01:56:52,578
I could never accept Vijay.

1910
01:56:55,209 --> 01:56:57,086
And that's why..

1911
01:56:57,377 --> 01:56:59,584
..you showered false
love on your step-brothen.

1912
01:56:59,847 --> 01:57:01,121
..and spoiled him.

1913
01:57:01,381 --> 01:57:03,019
So that he turned
out good for nothing...

1914
01:57:03,383 --> 01:57:05,329
And even lost respect
in his dad's eyes.

1915
01:57:06,853 --> 01:57:08,628
You could see the entire
property in your name..

1916
01:57:08,856 --> 01:57:11,234
"but you got a shock when"

1917
01:57:11,325 --> 01:57:14,636
..in the first will, your dad divided
the property equally.

1918
01:57:15,696 --> 01:57:18,267
You were furious,
but you lost control..

1919
01:57:18,331 --> 01:57:19,503
"when you found out that"

1920
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:21,545
“your papa is going
to change his will“.

1921
01:57:21,635 --> 01:57:23,672
..and donate half
his property to charity,

1922
01:57:24,137 --> 01:57:26,640
you decided that before
he changes his will“.

1923
01:57:26,774 --> 01:57:28,082
..you will change his world.

1924
01:57:28,174 --> 01:57:29,482
And put the blame on Vijay.

1925
01:57:30,243 --> 01:57:31,745
Thus, complete control over
the entire property.

1926
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:33,251
But so sad.

1927
01:57:33,847 --> 01:57:35,349
You had no clue that"

1928
01:57:35,415 --> 01:57:38,555
"Mahendra Pratap had
already signed his new will.

1929
01:57:39,052 --> 01:57:42,431
An important part
of your plan was Hari,

1930
01:57:42,489 --> 01:57:43,490
the mimicry artist.

1931
01:57:43,790 --> 01:57:45,098
It was his voice that Puran Kaka..

1932
01:57:45,159 --> 01:57:46,502
..and Vijay heard that night.

1933
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:48,030
Right?

1934
01:57:50,797 --> 01:57:53,539
That night, after calming Divya..

1935
01:57:55,369 --> 01:57:56,507
..I spoke to Hari.

1936
01:57:57,337 --> 01:57:58,247
Hello.

1937
01:57:58,806 --> 01:58:02,379
You always look for ways
to make money the easy way.

1938
01:58:04,511 --> 01:58:06,115
I will give you 1 million.

1939
01:58:06,513 --> 01:58:07,890
And your first break too.

1940
01:58:09,282 --> 01:58:11,387
You just need to show your talent.

1941
01:58:13,086 --> 01:58:14,121
He agreed.

1942
01:58:14,454 --> 01:58:16,331
My job became easier.

1943
01:58:53,794 --> 01:58:56,968
Then I took papa's phone to Hari.

1944
01:59:03,870 --> 01:59:07,215
Hello. - Bring a
jug of water to my room, Puran.

1945
01:59:08,008 --> 01:59:10,215
I want money, and that's it.

1946
01:59:11,445 --> 01:59:15,154
Yes, papa. - Vijay, come to my room.

1947
01:59:16,216 --> 01:59:18,924
And the next day I kept
the phone back in papa's room.

1948
01:59:19,386 --> 01:59:21,923
Hari was unaware that when
he was doing all this..

1949
01:59:22,022 --> 01:59:23,899
.. he's going
to be a part of a murder.

1950
01:59:24,457 --> 01:59:27,131
But when he realized
this, he was very scared.

1951
01:59:27,761 --> 01:59:29,138
And was preparing to flee.

1952
01:59:30,063 --> 01:59:32,339
Sanjay thought that I am after Hari.

1953
01:59:33,033 --> 01:59:35,013
That's when he called
Hari to a secluded spot"

1954
01:59:35,101 --> 01:59:36,045
..on the pretext of paying
the rest of the money.

1955
01:59:36,136 --> 01:59:37,877
But he killed him instead.

1956
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:51,819
Come with us.

1957
01:59:54,855 --> 01:59:56,493
You knew about your
husband's intentions..

1958
01:59:56,790 --> 01:59:58,133
..and his crime.

1959
02:00:00,861 --> 02:00:02,306
You were scared that
I might uncover him.

1960
02:00:02,362 --> 02:00:04,035
So you often followed me.

1961
02:00:05,031 --> 02:00:07,375
You even searched my room that day.

1962
02:00:07,667 --> 02:00:09,704
'Someone came into this
room two minutes ago.'

1963
02:00:11,171 --> 02:00:15,677
But...fear doesn't change
or hide the truth.

1964
02:00:47,307 --> 02:00:48,012
Shall we, CD.

1965
02:00:48,541 --> 02:00:51,021
By the way,
you're making more fans by the day.

1966
02:00:51,978 --> 02:00:53,013
Count me in.

1967
02:00:56,349 --> 02:00:57,293
Samrat.

1968
02:00:59,386 --> 02:01:02,629
We couldn't find Deepak's body.

1969
02:01:05,358 --> 02:01:09,500
Did you really
expectmto find his body?

1970
02:01:34,054 --> 02:01:36,432
Samrat. Thank you.

1971
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:39,797
I don't know whether
I should be happy or sad.

1972
02:01:40,293 --> 02:01:41,795
That's life.

1973
02:01:43,596 --> 02:01:45,803
Yes, this is for you.

1974
02:01:48,401 --> 02:01:49,471
Thank you.

1975
02:01:49,669 --> 02:01:50,807
Money is the 8th sense..

1976
02:01:51,071 --> 02:01:53,642
..that lets us enjoy the other senses.

1977
02:01:54,474 --> 02:01:55,475
Samrat.

1978
02:01:56,176 --> 02:01:57,746
Someone's sent this bouquet for you.

1979
02:01:58,345 --> 02:01:59,824
But I can't figure
out what's written on it.

1980
02:02:09,089 --> 02:02:11,433
Some riddles are best left unsolved.

1981
02:02:12,692 --> 02:02:13,602
Thanks.

1982
02:02:17,597 --> 02:02:18,473
Samrat.

1983
02:02:23,003 --> 02:02:24,778
If I ever need you again“.

1984
02:02:25,004 --> 02:02:26,779
...will I have to suffer
the journey again...

1985
02:02:28,508 --> 02:02:29,612
Or can I give you a call?

1986
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:34,518
What are you thinking?

1987
02:02:35,448 --> 02:02:37,394
Answer that call and you'll
find me on the other side.

1988
02:02:39,252 --> 02:02:41,562
Save it.
- Thank you.

1989
02:02:42,722 --> 02:02:45,794
Do you have to go today?
- Yes.

1990
02:02:47,561 --> 02:02:48,801
But before I leave
I want to say something"

1991
02:02:49,095 --> 02:02:50,506
..which I have never
said to anyone before.

1992
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:51,667
What?

1993
02:02:53,166 --> 02:02:54,201
We'll meet again.

1994
02:03:03,042 --> 02:03:04,817
I am fed up of this cold.

1995
02:03:06,179 --> 02:03:08,557
I am going to enjoy
the heat in Mumbai.

1996
02:03:09,048 --> 02:03:11,153
No work for an entire month.

1997
02:03:14,354 --> 02:03:15,264
Samrat.

1998
02:03:19,759 --> 02:03:20,760
What?

1999
02:03:23,263 --> 02:03:25,243
Fine, we'll be there.

2000
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,377
Guess what?

2001
02:03:28,435 --> 02:03:30,779
That was Her Highness Priyanka
Raghuvanshi of Dharamgatpur.

2002
02:03:31,237 --> 02:03:32,773
The 200 year old gold statue"

2003
02:03:33,006 --> 02:03:34,314
..of a King of Raghuvanshi dynasty,
Sangramaditya Raghuvanshi..

2004
02:03:34,374 --> 02:03:37,218
.. is shedding tears of blood.

2005
02:03:38,011 --> 02:03:40,048
We've to start working
on the case from tomorrow.

2006
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:42,223
Tears from a golden statue?

2007
02:03:42,649 --> 02:03:44,219
And that too of blood.

2008
02:03:45,585 --> 02:03:48,657
We just got rid of one ghost,
and now there's another!

2009
02:03:48,755 --> 02:03:50,792
Why don't you take some normal case?

2010
02:03:51,758 --> 02:03:54,238
CD, easy challenges
are like broken pencils...

2011
02:03:55,094 --> 02:03:56,471
There's no point!
