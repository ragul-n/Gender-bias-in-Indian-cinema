1
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:37,208
I joined police services in this area station five years back.

2
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:40,292
Many sub-inspectors have come and gone in this period.

3
01:01:40,792 --> 01:01:42,500
But you are the first S.I...

4
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:46,000
Who has voluntarily enquired about this case.That too on your first day.

5
01:01:46,542 --> 01:01:47,625
It’s good…

6
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,458
…but I am telling you out of concern.

7
01:01:49,792 --> 01:01:51,708
It’s better to maintain a low profile here.

8
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:54,250
This is a nasty area.

9
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,083
And the case you are talking about...

10
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:57,750
...it is not even registered.

11
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,500
That murder is just a rumour, sir.

12
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:01,792
Just came to my ear, through the grapevine.

13
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:03,333
It’s okay.

14
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:05,500
I like rumours better than the truth.

15
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,667
Tell me.

16
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:10,875
They say it happened eight years back.

17
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:13,167
A lot of pigeon racing happens in this area.

18
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:16,583
There is talk that this murder was a result of one of those fights.

19
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:19,625
Pigeon racing? What’s that?

20
01:02:19,833 --> 01:02:21,167
You’ve never heard about it?

21
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:23,250
It’s very common in Chennai, sir.

22
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,792
But no one seems to know about it.

23
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,583
There are two types of pigeon racing, sir.

24
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:28,375
One. Homing pigeon.

25
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:32,542
Each participant enters about five to ten pigeons, sir.

26
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:34,208
The day before the race…

27
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,125
…participants bring their pigeons to the club.

28
01:02:36,417 --> 01:02:38,500
Each of the pigeons are given tags.

29
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:41,417
A secret numbered ring is fixed to the pigeon’s leg.

30
01:02:45,917 --> 01:02:49,250
Then all pigeons are transported through a lorry or train.

31
01:02:51,792 --> 01:02:53,375
Depending on the race distance…

32
01:02:53,375 --> 01:02:55,167
…they select a town.

33
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,250
Like Nellore, Bhopal, Delhi.

34
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:02,250
All the cages are lined up there.

35
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:04,750
And all the pigeons are released at once!

36
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:12,417
No matter how far away you take it...

37
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:15,208
It flies right back to its owner’s place!

38
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,917
The pigeon that reaches first wins the race.

39
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:20,917
The other kind is Tumbler tournament.

40
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:23,833
Tumblers can perform somersaults while flying.

41
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:28,417
Pigeon fanciers have a lot of respect for it.

42
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:30,167
They host the tournaments fairly.

43
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,208
They don’t allow gambling in these tournaments.

44
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,250
But there is a lot of competition and rivalry.

45
01:03:34,417 --> 01:03:37,958
There is talk that the murder you’re asking abouthappened during one such issue.

46
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:39,125
Who did it?

47
01:03:39,417 --> 01:03:40,917
There is this guy called “Coal” Velu, sir.

48
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,042
You might have heard.

49
01:03:42,292 --> 01:03:44,875
This entire area is under his control, sir.

50
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:47,208
He exports red sanders illegally, sir.

51
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:49,708
Even he’s been a pigeon fancier for years.

52
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,625
The killer was from his gang.

53
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:53,750
A twenty two year old boy!

54
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:55,958
He wasn’t even a gangster back then.

55
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:57,708
Just a boy who raised pigeons.

56
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,542
He used to look after Velu anna’s racing pigeons.

57
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:02,667
One night, a guy from the opponent’s gang…

58
01:04:02,917 --> 01:04:05,500
…slit his favourite pigeon’s throat.

59
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:06,875
That was it!

60
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:09,208
And he killed a man who was feared until then.

61
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,625
This boy went and stabbed him to death in blind rage.

62
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:20,458
He was just a boy who raised pigeons until then.

63
01:04:20,667 --> 01:04:22,250
They say he's reached a whole new level since then!

64
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:24,125
That was eight years back.

65
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:26,333
He's the big-gun in the hood these days.

66
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:28,333
We can't even lay a finger on him, sir.

67
01:04:28,667 --> 01:04:29,667
What did you say his name was?

68
01:04:31,292 --> 01:04:31,833
Maari!

69
01:04:50,792 --> 01:04:52,500
Velu anna has many areas under his control.

70
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:54,708
He handed one of those areas to Maari.

71
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:01,042
His cut reaches him promptly every month.

72
01:05:02,958 --> 01:05:05,500
Velu anna’s main business is smuggling red sanders.

73
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:08,542
It’s the top illegal business in Chennai and Andhra these days.

74
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:12,375
A tonne of red sanders can fetch upto a million at the foreign market.

75
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:14,333
Velu anna has too many cases filed against him.

76
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:15,917
And even more enemies.

77
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,083
So he doesn’t get out much.

78
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:20,167
He handles all deals through Maari.

79
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,333
There’s another man under Velu called “Bird” Ravi.

80
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:25,750
He wants to be a part of Velu’s business;

81
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:27,958
But Velu’s support is for Maari.

82
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:30,917
Velu doesn’t get involved in Maari’s jurisdiction.

83
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:32,875
Nothing happens at odds with him.

84
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:37,333
Want to pay up nicely?Or should I smash your shop up?

85
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:39,250
They’re robbing us under broad daylight!

86
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:41,250
Is there no one to fight them?

87
01:05:56,292 --> 01:05:59,125
Poor thing has been boiling in the sun, his feet swollen!

88
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:00,375
He’s asking so sweetly.

89
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:02,458
You’re asking to be beaten?

90
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,292
Call yourself a gangster?

91
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:05,958
Koochie-kooing with him!

92
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:07,167
Can’t beat him up and get it?

93
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:08,083
He's a ruffian.

94
01:06:08,417 --> 01:06:09,417
When he gets angry…

95
01:06:09,958 --> 01:06:11,167
…everyone around him flees.

96
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,208
But when he’s with his pigeons…

97
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:16,542
You can see his other side.

98
01:06:16,917 --> 01:06:17,917
He immediately becomes kind!

99
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:20,125
This bad guy appears to be a good guy…

100
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:22,167
…when he’s with the pigeons.

101
01:06:24,042 --> 01:06:26,167
For ages, Velu was hosting these tournaments.

102
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:28,167
Then he left Maari in charge.

103
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,042
Despite a lot of illegal business…

104
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:32,292
…he’s very honest when it comes to pigeons.

105
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,625
He conducts these tournaments supervised by senior fanciers.

106
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:36,958
If someone cheats, he gets very angry.

107
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:39,083
He stops being kind. Hard to deal with him then!

108
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:57,208
Do the people in the area like him?

109
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:58,750
No. Not at all!

110
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:01,042
His only friends are boys who raise pigeons.

111
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:04,417
The people are really pissed off with him!

112
01:07:04,917 --> 01:07:06,125
He’s a naughty fellow, sir.

113
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:08,417
He causes trouble just for the fun of it.

114
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:11,125
Keeps causing some problem or the other for everyone.

115
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,833
He went to get his hair trimmed one day.

116
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:15,083
He waltzed straight into the seat, not awaiting his turn.

117
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:17,333
One customer who was already waiting…

118
01:07:17,542 --> 01:07:19,542
…just stopped Maari and sat down.

119
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:23,375
That was it! They just shaved him bald!

120
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:25,375
At least this guy only lost his hair.

121
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,208
There was a cricket match playing one day…

122
01:07:27,542 --> 01:07:30,042
He got fully drunkand was watching the match at a T.V showroom.

123
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:32,875
One ball- Three runs. How is it possible?

124
01:07:33,042 --> 01:07:34,792
It was a World Cup semi-final match.

125
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:37,458
Unfortunately for them, India lost!

126
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:38,875
Oh my God!

127
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:42,750
Oh no! India has lost.

128
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:48,750
Shopguy! Come out.

129
01:07:51,583 --> 01:07:52,833
There are so many T.Vs here.

130
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:54,917
How come India didn’t win in even one of the T.Vs?

131
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:56,917
Why didn’t they win?- Don’t hit me, Maari.

132
01:07:57,083 --> 01:07:58,167
Why didn’t they win?

133
01:07:58,667 --> 01:07:59,792
Smash every single T.V, Maari!

134
01:08:00,792 --> 01:08:02,333
Don’t break it!

135
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:06,167
Move, I want to break a T.V too!

136
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,000
He doesn’t even leave the children alone.

137
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,125
What trouble does he cause children?

138
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:16,042
Hey, come here. -Yes, brother?

139
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:18,083
Go!

140
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:19,458
How was that?

141
01:08:20,583 --> 01:08:22,458
Does he at least treat his boys well?

142
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:24,333
He has a boy called Robert.

143
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:26,083
His nickname is “Punching bag”.

144
01:08:26,417 --> 01:08:29,458
He just summons the “Punching bag” from wherever, just to bash him up;

145
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:32,333
Only then does he cool down.

146
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:33,958
Why have the beer prices gone up?

147
01:08:34,167 --> 01:08:35,042
Why?

148
01:08:35,042 --> 01:08:36,042
Why have you raised it?

149
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:36,833
Why is it so sunny?

150
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:37,667
Why is it sunny?

151
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:39,667
Why do you wake me up when I’m asleep?

152
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:40,917
I can only awaken a sleeping person!

153
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,833
You’re retorting? Huh?

154
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:45,542
Why didn’t you wake me up? I asked you, right?

155
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:47,750
How could they give the last over to Ashish Nehra?

156
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:49,083
How could they? How could they?

157
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:51,375
There’s another loafer who hangs out with Maari.

158
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:52,792
His name is Saturday.

159
01:08:53,083 --> 01:08:54,917
Saturday? What kind of a name is that?

160
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:58,375
Come Saturday, I compulsorily drink.

161
01:08:58,708 --> 01:09:00,000
So you don’t drink on other days?

162
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,083
I do drink!

163
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:02,917
So just not compulsorily on other days?

164
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:05,042
No! Dirty fellow.

165
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:06,625
I definitely drink on other days, too.

166
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:08,458
Then why is your name Saturday?

167
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:11,542
Come Saturday, I compulsorily drink.

168
01:09:12,417 --> 01:09:14,417
He’s scratching his head; He’s confused. Good.

169
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:18,292
This Saturday selects people from the area…

170
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:21,375
…and organizes a song and dance show for Maari.

171
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,958
He brings everyone by force and makes them sing and dance!

172
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,833
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

173
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:29,208
Such a warm evening.-Meaning?

174
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:30,792
I’m really proud of you!

175
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:33,250
I’m very happy to see you all.

176
01:09:33,542 --> 01:09:36,667
Tonight, special program by Mr. Maari Boys Team!

177
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:39,958
Proudly presents the game of “Laugh or Die”.

178
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:41,875
What’s “Laugh or Die”?

179
01:09:42,042 --> 01:09:44,625
You perform, and if Maari doesn’t laugh, you die!

180
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:45,375
Shut up!

181
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,042
Call this dancing?

182
01:09:48,375 --> 01:09:49,625
What’s he doing?

183
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:54,833
Move your hips!

184
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,417
There! Face Maari.

185
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,417
Face them! Face them when you dance.

186
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:02,208
Not good! Bring on the next.

187
01:10:03,292 --> 01:10:04,250
Stand in your position.

188
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:05,458
Dance properly!

189
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:06,792
More heavy.

190
01:10:07,542 --> 01:10:08,167
What's this?!

191
01:10:08,417 --> 01:10:11,375
Look at this. Look at this baby’s performance.

192
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,375
Bloody idiot! Dance like this.

193
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:15,750
All this happens.

194
01:10:15,917 --> 01:10:17,083
But we can’t do anything.

195
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:18,917
That’s how much he’s feared.

196
01:10:19,333 --> 01:10:20,833
There was a tournament even yesterday.

197
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:22,750
Maari won the cup, as always.

198
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,500
Can’t control the rave in the area today!

199
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:07,208
His name- Prominent

200
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,750
This guy- He's different

201
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:12,042
He paves new routes

202
01:11:12,542 --> 01:11:14,542
With his steel heart he rules

203
01:11:15,292 --> 01:11:17,667
His soul knows no guilt;No order.

204
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:20,125
No guilt and no order in him!

205
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,917
He's seen all maladies;And misery.

206
01:11:23,042 --> 01:11:25,417
He has seen it all.

207
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:27,125
Maari…

208
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:30,417
He's the good one - He's Maari!The dashing one - Maari

209
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:32,125
Maari…

210
01:11:33,292 --> 01:11:35,542
Rub him and he's gold, this MaariSnub him and he's a beast, this Maari

211
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,500
Maari…

212
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:38,667
Doesn't know the world;

213
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:41,125
Doesn't heed law and order.

214
01:12:41,375 --> 01:12:43,458
Doesn't like to change his ways;

215
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:45,917
Doesn't have time for love.

216
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:48,500
Don't try threatening him;

217
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:50,958
He is a solo contestant.

218
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,542
Don't you dare pick on him;

219
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
He's a ruthless opponent.

220
01:13:13,042 --> 01:13:14,750
Today’s Boss Velu’s birthday.

221
01:13:15,042 --> 01:13:18,000
I’ll kill you if there’s a bad show at “Laugh or Die”.

222
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:20,750
I’ve got a special item here for Boss!-Yuck!

223
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:23,125
Feels light weight.

224
01:13:23,542 --> 01:13:24,000
Look!

225
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:26,083
What’s it?-It’s an item you’ll like.

226
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:27,417
Hey, come out.

227
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,417
Who’s he?

228
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:35,875
Product name: Anirudh.

229
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:37,667
Ani…?-Rudh!

230
01:13:38,542 --> 01:13:39,917
What does he do?-He plays!

231
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:42,417
He plays music and sings well, it seems.

232
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:44,500
Perform for us.

233
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:47,208
I need some instruments, man.-Get him those instruments.

234
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,083
Why?

235
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:51,000
Cool. Cool!

236
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:53,042
Not necessary. Just sing and dance.

237
01:13:53,292 --> 01:13:54,292
Okay, I’ll do it.

238
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,333
Careful!

239
01:13:55,917 --> 01:13:56,667
Eww!

240
01:13:57,125 --> 01:13:58,250
What’s he wearing?

241
01:13:58,375 --> 01:13:59,875
Look at his cap and glasses!

242
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,250
Get him changed.

243
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,500
Let’s go, dear.-Lift him!

244
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:04,417
Bro, I’ll come on my own.

245
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:38,250
We should just let him be…

246
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:40,083
…mind our jobs and be safe.

247
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:42,125
Sir, where are we going?

248
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:43,500
Take the vehicle to Maari’s area.

249
01:14:45,292 --> 01:14:48,250
I’ve got information that betting is taking place at the pigeon tournament today.

250
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:51,125
We’ll catch him red handed.

251
01:14:51,542 --> 01:14:52,292
But, sir.

252
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:55,042
We shouldn’t even enter there without his permission, sir.

253
01:14:56,042 --> 01:14:58,125
Are we the police or is he? Start the jeep.

254
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:15,875
Hey, you are banned this year, right?

255
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,750
What are you doing here? Just leave.

256
01:15:17,917 --> 01:15:19,750
I just came to watch. Can’t I watch?

257
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:20,833
Just leave.

258
01:15:23,667 --> 01:15:25,083
Sir, he tumbled once!

259
01:15:25,417 --> 01:15:27,667
Bro, was that okay?-That was okay, son.

260
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:30,792
What? Why is it descending already?

261
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,542
Looks like he won’t make it!

262
01:15:40,542 --> 01:15:41,542
Who’s that auntie?

263
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:44,333
You’re pretending to flail your cloth;Making the bird fly away!

264
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,750
I don’t even know that woman. Must be a neighbour.

265
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:49,542
Lady, don’t know about the tournament? Dry your clothes elsewhere.

266
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:50,292
Hit him!

267
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:52,500
He’s lying. That’s his wife.

268
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:54,292
You’ve set her up?- No, brother.

269
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:55,708
Why would you set-up your own wife?

270
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:57,125
Is she your wife or a set-up?

271
01:15:58,167 --> 01:15:59,542
Note that down! That his bird has lost.

272
01:15:59,667 --> 01:16:00,667
Don’t do that, sir!

273
01:16:01,167 --> 01:16:02,375
You cheat!

274
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:08,167
How come I hear a jeep in here?

275
01:16:18,292 --> 01:16:19,250
It’s them, sir.

276
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:22,917
Where is Maari?

277
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:23,917
Look at that!

278
01:16:24,417 --> 01:16:26,542
Firstly, you shouldn’t have walked in without our permission.

279
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:29,250
And you have the guts to ask for Maari?

280
01:16:29,542 --> 01:16:31,417
I’ve got information that betting happens here.

281
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:32,750
Betting?

282
01:16:32,917 --> 01:16:34,542
The jeep belongs in Chepauk!

283
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:36,250
Must have lost its way and ended up here.

284
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:38,417
We’re just letting the pigeons fly and looking at the skies…

285
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:40,667
…He uses big words like “gambling”!

286
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:43,792
You can’t organise such tournaments without police permission.

287
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:45,708
Stop everything. I need to see Maari.

288
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:46,875
Clear the crowd!

289
01:16:47,083 --> 01:16:48,083
What’s the noise?

290
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:57,250
Stop crowding the place, go!

291
01:16:57,542 --> 01:16:59,083
Just leave, now.

292
01:17:03,333 --> 01:17:04,792
Did you ask for protection?

293
01:17:05,042 --> 01:17:05,833
No, Maari.

294
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,542
Then what’s the officer doing here?

295
01:17:12,042 --> 01:17:14,083
A cop's job is where the rowdies are.

296
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:15,750
Rowdies?

297
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:20,125
We’re flying the symbol of peace and you call us rowdies?

298
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:23,333
This is something we do for the pride; It’s not a gamble.

299
01:17:24,083 --> 01:17:26,417
Some enemy of mine has told you lies about me.

300
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:29,250
Only a man who does wrong will have enemies.

301
01:17:36,042 --> 01:17:36,917
You should leave, sir.

302
01:17:38,042 --> 01:17:40,208
Won’t be nice if we forced you out.

303
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,208
Your threats won’t scare me.

304
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:47,000
I’ve got evidence.

305
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:50,125
Just stop everything and co-operate to the investigation.

306
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,542
Evidence?

307
01:17:53,417 --> 01:17:56,000
Evidence…

308
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,667
Hey!

309
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:01,500
Come here, boy.

310
01:18:02,542 --> 01:18:03,542
He won’t hit you! Come.

311
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:04,958
Come!

312
01:18:06,042 --> 01:18:06,875
Come here.

313
01:18:08,667 --> 01:18:09,167
Listen.

314
01:18:09,958 --> 01:18:12,333
You got into a mess when you cheated last year.

315
01:18:12,708 --> 01:18:15,292
I banned you this year because you can’t pay up the entry fees.

316
01:18:15,583 --> 01:18:18,583
But you shouldn’t go to the officer and tell him lies about me!

317
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:20,958
You tell us.

318
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:23,833
Does something illegal happen here?-Let him go.

319
01:18:24,542 --> 01:18:26,500
Talk to me. – Wait, I’ll ask and tell.

320
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:27,542
Tell him!

321
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:29,125
Does anything illegal happen?

322
01:18:31,292 --> 01:18:33,333
Tell, does anything illegal happen?

323
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:34,542
Just tell him.

324
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:46,000
Sir, let’s just leave, sir!

325
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:51,292
Didn’t he say nothing illegal happens here?

326
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:54,625
Leave.

327
01:18:55,125 --> 01:18:56,250
Let’s leave, sir. Come, sir!

328
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:04,083
Who is he?

329
01:19:04,542 --> 01:19:06,167
The new sub-inspector in the area, Maari.

330
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,667
Little bugs seem to be getting ideas now.

331
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,250
I’ll finish them off!

332
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:44,000
Shall we go, sir?

333
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:46,042
You should leave, sir.

334
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:48,375
Won’t be nice if we forced you out.

335
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:52,208
Sir?

336
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,417
Stop brooding over it, sir.

337
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:56,833
What can we do?

338
01:19:57,458 --> 01:19:58,958
He’s backed by many.

339
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:01,167
We will have to adjust a little.

340
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:04,083
Not just you; All the policemen.

341
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:06,750
I’m not like all the policemen, Arumugam.

342
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:09,875
He’s known to have committed a murder.

343
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:12,750
If we still can’t lock him up; What’s the point in being a policeman?

344
01:20:12,917 --> 01:20:14,917
How can we act upon rumours?

345
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:18,625
It’s still a rumour because everyone let it be that way.

346
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:20,042
Someone told you this rumour.

347
01:20:20,417 --> 01:20:21,917
Someone else told him.

348
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:25,292
If we follow the trail, it won’t be hearsay.

349
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,250
We’ll find the origin.

350
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:28,708
We start tomorrow.

351
01:20:29,292 --> 01:20:30,250
With you.

352
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:32,083
And connect it all the way to Maari.

353
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:33,833
Mom!

354
01:20:34,417 --> 01:20:34,875
Mom!

355
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:37,417
You said you’ll buy me a new bag, mom!

356
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,250
I’m struggling to make ends meet.

357
01:20:39,458 --> 01:20:40,875
You want a new bag?

358
01:20:41,125 --> 01:20:42,875
Use the one you already have.

359
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,500
It’s torn, mom!

360
01:20:44,667 --> 01:20:46,250
Everyone in school makes fun.

361
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:48,792
I’ll stitch it tomorrow. Use it for now.

362
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:50,208
Always nagging me!

363
01:20:50,542 --> 01:20:53,875
I won’t go to school if you don’t get me a new bag.

364
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:56,458
Don’t go, then. What do I care?

365
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:58,042
Bugging me in the mornings!

366
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,750
Please, mom!

367
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:03,250
Loudspeaker Kavitha!

368
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:06,000
I’m pissed off already. Don’t start.

369
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:07,042
Look at that!

370
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:10,292
Your yelling woke me up in the morning.

371
01:21:10,708 --> 01:21:11,792
And now you’re pissed?

372
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,708
You don’t even have a sweet voice.

373
01:21:14,042 --> 01:21:16,542
First thing in the morning, you yell “Mom, mom!”

374
01:21:16,792 --> 01:21:19,833
Look, mom! He’s always making fun of me.

375
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:23,208
You know he’s pulling your leg. Why do you care?

376
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:24,875
You’re getting late. Go on!

377
01:21:26,417 --> 01:21:28,125
This has become a routine!

378
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,000
Why make fun of the child in the mornings?

379
01:21:30,958 --> 01:21:32,250
What were you doing, then?

380
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:33,750
You weren’t coddling either!

381
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,375
She only wants a bag. Can’t buy one?

382
01:21:36,667 --> 01:21:38,542
Where do I get the money?

383
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:41,458
If your husband doesn’t drink for two days,you’ll get the money.

384
01:21:41,667 --> 01:21:43,625
You talk so much, why can’t you buy her one?

385
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:45,458
I would have bought it if you’d married me.

386
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:46,500
You missed your chance.

387
01:21:48,292 --> 01:21:49,167
Look at that face!

388
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:53,875
Maari.

389
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:56,542
Did someone tell you they’re moving into door number 8?

390
01:21:58,042 --> 01:21:59,792
No. No one told me.  Why?

391
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:03,042
Then someone has moved in without our permission.

392
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:23,750
I said stop.

393
01:22:24,042 --> 01:22:25,417
Painting without permission….

394
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:26,667
Stop it, I say!

395
01:22:27,292 --> 01:22:29,333
No respect for a gangster!

396
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:30,458
Move aside, Lady.

397
01:22:30,667 --> 01:22:31,708
Oh, sorry. It’s a mannequin.

398
01:22:31,875 --> 01:22:34,167
Why are you just standing there? Here, hang this.- Okay, ma'am.

399
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
She asked me to hang this against the wall.

400
01:22:37,083 --> 01:22:38,417
Why not her face?

401
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:41,625
Taking orders from a woman!We’re gangsters, man!

402
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,125
What is this?

403
01:22:44,917 --> 01:22:48,958
Think you can just move in herewithout permission?

404
01:22:49,167 --> 01:22:51,042
Who are you? Why should I tell you?

405
01:22:51,292 --> 01:22:54,125
Whatever happens in the area,happens only with Maari's permission.

406
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:55,250
Got it, white bro?

407
01:22:55,625 --> 01:22:56,708
Are you doing rowdyism?

408
01:22:57,167 --> 01:22:58,375
I was doing comedy till now.

409
01:22:58,625 --> 01:23:00,375
Now I am doing rowdyism.

410
01:23:00,792 --> 01:23:01,875
Here, this is rowdyism.

411
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:02,708
Please!

412
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:05,042
That house broker never told us anything about this.

413
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:06,875
He said he told you.

414
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:09,042
No, sir! When did you tell us?

415
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:10,542
Not to you, sir.- Then?

416
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:14,292
I told her, sir.

417
01:23:59,000 --> 01:23:59,792
Slap you!

418
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:01,333
Hey Maari, control yourself!

419
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:02,708
It’s morning time.

420
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:03,958
Think you can touch me?

421
01:24:04,667 --> 01:24:06,833
Had you not been a woman, I’d have ruined you.

422
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:09,042
No. Don’t ruin my daughter.

423
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:10,417
Poor thing, she made a mistake.

424
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,833
She keeps talking...

425
01:24:12,542 --> 01:24:13,667
...what did we do wrong?

426
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:15,000
We only did our duty, right?

427
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:16,958
Did the broker tell you anything?

428
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:17,625
Yes.

429
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,042
Why didn’t you tell us anything?

430
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:21,083
Mom. Why should we pay them up?

431
01:24:21,542 --> 01:24:24,000
It seems I need to pay them extra to open a boutique.

432
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:27,167
So mother and daughter are planning to open a petty shop here?

433
01:24:27,458 --> 01:24:29,750
No. Not a petty shop. Boutique.

434
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:33,583
Mom. Why are you explaining all this to them?

435
01:24:34,417 --> 01:24:35,167
Look here.

436
01:24:36,458 --> 01:24:38,750
Break your finger! Drop it.

437
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:41,000
This is my house.

438
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:43,375
I’ll do as I wish. Okay?

439
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:44,458
Look here.

440
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:46,333
Keep your petty shop.

441
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:47,625
Or keep a cloth store.

442
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,167
Keep him if you want.- Yes!

443
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:50,375
Keep whatever you want!

444
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,167
But who’ll give you protection for all that?

445
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:55,000
Give us our cut, and keep whatever you want.

446
01:24:55,292 --> 01:24:57,375
Protection? For what?

447
01:24:57,792 --> 01:24:59,875
What will happen here?-Anything could happen.

448
01:25:00,583 --> 01:25:01,833
This glass could fall and shatter.

449
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:03,958
Saw that?

450
01:25:04,208 --> 01:25:07,208
That cupboard could topple and break.-Don’t do that, sir.

451
01:25:08,792 --> 01:25:10,000
Something lighter, please!

452
01:25:10,792 --> 01:25:12,625
Right. Okay, the T.V.

453
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:14,750
Don’t break the T.V.

454
01:25:15,167 --> 01:25:17,000
Dear, just give them the money.

455
01:25:18,417 --> 01:25:20,292
This covers the house, who’ll pay for the petty shop?

456
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,083
Boutique!

457
01:25:23,292 --> 01:25:25,208
You’ll have to pay double for English names.

458
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:26,542
I don’t have cash in hand.

459
01:25:26,625 --> 01:25:28,000
Give us some time, we’ll pay up.

460
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:29,875
One week.

461
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:31,958
Dad! I'm going to the police.

462
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:34,583
It's the police station we're going to next;For our "collection".

463
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:37,333
It's a funny girl, Maari!

464
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:51,333
The way you were staring at her, I was happy.I thought you were in love!

465
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,583
What? Love?

466
01:25:52,708 --> 01:25:54,833
For the first time, I felt like slapping a girl.

467
01:25:54,917 --> 01:25:57,083
I have a principle against hitting women.So I let it go.

468
01:25:57,458 --> 01:25:59,542
We’ve seen in so many Tamil movies…

469
01:25:59,708 --> 01:26:04,667
…The heroine swears in slow motion;The hero takes it with a smile on his face

470
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:06,000
And they fall in love.

471
01:26:06,292 --> 01:26:08,208
How can you fall in love when a woman is yelling at your face.

472
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:10,833
I’d rather catch chikungunya than fall in love.

473
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,042
Then my route is clear.- What?

474
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:13,375
No, I meant this is the route to go.

475
01:26:13,792 --> 01:26:16,042
That girl talks too much, keep her under control.

476
01:26:16,792 --> 01:26:17,792
Shift. Shift.

477
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:19,375
Move it up.

478
01:26:19,792 --> 01:26:20,500
Okay, fix it.

479
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:21,708
How is it?-Super

480
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:52,333
Look, mom.

481
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:55,500
Hey, where are you guys? Come here.- Be quiet, don’t yell.

482
01:27:07,792 --> 01:27:09,000
Yes, leave it there.

483
01:27:09,792 --> 01:27:12,458
Don’t shake it. Fix it like that.

484
01:27:13,917 --> 01:27:15,792
Hello. Why are you keeping this here?

485
01:27:16,042 --> 01:27:17,167
We keep it here every year.

486
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:18,792
It’s our lucky spot.

487
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:20,750
How do we enter then?

488
01:27:20,917 --> 01:27:22,250
Lie down and crawl inside.

489
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:24,333
Being nice because you’re an old guy. Go.

490
01:27:25,833 --> 01:27:29,292
Hey! How dare you stare at me like that?

491
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:31,292
What is this?

492
01:27:33,625 --> 01:27:34,792
Staring at me, dear?

493
01:27:36,917 --> 01:27:38,250
Must be crazy.-What are you staring at?

494
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:39,667
You tie it up, brother.

495
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:49,042
Hi, Veeran Nagar.

496
01:27:50,917 --> 01:27:52,292
Got electrocuted?-Why?

497
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:53,875
Okay, we’ll do it my way.

498
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:59,083
Maari Boys are hosting 11th Annual Tumbler Pigeon and High Flyer Pigeon Competition.

499
01:27:59,125 --> 01:28:00,542
We’re having a prize distribution.

500
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:02,542
When we call out your name, come collect your prizes.

501
01:28:02,708 --> 01:28:04,500
One important thing...

502
01:28:05,083 --> 01:28:10,083
Some people fly their pigeons every year just for the consolation prizes.

503
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:12,917
We’ve got some vessels for you.You can collect them and go.

504
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:15,000
Medals, bro.-Whatever, give it to them.

505
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:17,792
Maari is here. Applause!

506
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,875
Maari and the oldies will greet each other.

507
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:31,292
The first prize goes to Maari’s pigeon as usual.

508
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:33,792
As we’re hosting it we’ll be magnanimous.

509
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:37,708
But the oldies still want to honour Maari.

510
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,542
Clap! Louder!

511
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:43,292
After all those foreign medicines, all we get is the consolation prize?

512
01:28:44,042 --> 01:28:45,833
This Maari does something special.

513
01:28:46,583 --> 01:28:48,500
Our birds have no value in the market.

514
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:52,625
Even people from Delhi and Calcutta want Maari’s birds.

515
01:28:53,958 --> 01:28:55,542
We’ll change everything tomorrow.

516
01:28:55,958 --> 01:29:00,542
Next up, for the consolation prize, come on stage “Bird” Ravi.

517
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:02,167
You go get it.

518
01:29:02,458 --> 01:29:04,125
Hey, you’re “Bird” Ravi right? You should come up.

519
01:29:04,542 --> 01:29:05,458
I’ll come.

520
01:29:07,083 --> 01:29:08,125
Put it on his head.

521
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:13,042
That’s enough.

522
01:29:18,792 --> 01:29:22,292
“Bird” Ravi wishes to organise a Tumbler-High Flyer tournament tomorrow.

523
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,750
Nothing happens outside your control. Hence…

524
01:29:25,958 --> 01:29:28,000
It only works if one person does it.

525
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:29,583
If there’s some problem...

526
01:29:29,833 --> 01:29:31,333
Maari’s name is at stake for granting permission.

527
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:33,542
You’re the host, you’re the winner...

528
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:35,250
...what do we do, Maari?

529
01:29:35,583 --> 01:29:38,583
What are you trying to say? That we win because we host?

530
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:39,958
Not like that.

531
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:41,833
You’ll win anyway.

532
01:29:42,167 --> 01:29:44,958
At least we’ll have the pride of hosting it.

533
01:29:45,167 --> 01:29:47,042
It will boost our pigeon’s market value.

534
01:29:47,292 --> 01:29:49,542
Earlier, “Bird” Ravi’s pigeons had some value.

535
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:51,875
Now everyone comes after only your pigeons.

536
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:53,500
We’re asking this as a favour.

537
01:29:53,708 --> 01:29:56,125
We’ve got the money and the manpower to host it.

538
01:29:56,583 --> 01:29:59,708
We’ll give you your share of the entry fees.

539
01:30:00,042 --> 01:30:02,500
You can participate, you don’t have to pay an entry fee.

540
01:30:03,667 --> 01:30:05,833
Wow! What an offer. Very generous.

541
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:08,708
No Maari. I said it like it is.

542
01:30:12,833 --> 01:30:15,042
Hosting or paying is not the matter here.

543
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:18,000
You should maintain the sanctity of the tournament.  That’s important.

544
01:30:18,292 --> 01:30:21,250
We’ll handle all that, Maari. You should give us a chance once.

545
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:23,625
Okay. Let’s give it a shot.

546
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:29,875
Thanks, Maari.

547
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
But we’re not flying our birds.

548
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:32,250
Why, Maari?

549
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,500
You said we always win it.

550
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:35,875
Why piss you off?

551
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,375
No, Maari. We’ll be very proud if your pigeon wins in our tournament.

552
01:30:51,792 --> 01:30:54,208
When did I tell you about the murder? Stop babbling.

553
01:30:55,125 --> 01:30:56,750
You told me right here, the other night.

554
01:30:56,833 --> 01:30:58,000
Are you out of your mind?

555
01:30:58,375 --> 01:30:59,750
You’re enquiring about him here?

556
01:31:00,042 --> 01:31:01,875
Sir, I just blurted some nonsense, sir.

557
01:31:02,292 --> 01:31:03,833
It was the “Tea Shop” Selva who told me.

558
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:06,375
Officer, I don’t know anything.

559
01:31:06,542 --> 01:31:08,583
I might have believed you if you hadn’t spilt the tea.

560
01:31:08,833 --> 01:31:09,667
Tell me the truth.

561
01:31:09,875 --> 01:31:13,208
Some say it happened, some say it didn’t.

562
01:31:13,375 --> 01:31:14,375
Who are these people?

563
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:16,208
This guy called Muthu, in the 2nd street.

564
01:31:17,292 --> 01:31:18,417
Oh, that junkie?

565
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:20,208
The murder happened for real…

566
01:31:20,792 --> 01:31:22,833
…during a gang war eight years back.

567
01:31:23,083 --> 01:31:24,083
That’s all I know.

568
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:26,125
Everything we heard since morning is a waste.

569
01:31:26,292 --> 01:31:28,917
This guy called Anbu; Father and son pick pockets.

570
01:31:29,458 --> 01:31:31,208
Dad is old school, does a neat job.

571
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:32,792
But the son is a rookie.

572
01:31:33,167 --> 01:31:35,667
Even last week got caught doing a job at the market.

573
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:38,833
The guy got away, but everyone saw his face.

574
01:31:39,042 --> 01:31:41,250
His case is registered, we can use that to threaten him.

575
01:31:41,875 --> 01:31:44,375
Eight years back, Maari committed a murder.

576
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,417
What do you know about it?

577
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:47,875
About Maari?

578
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:50,750
I don’t know anything.

579
01:31:52,375 --> 01:31:54,125
Someone has given you false information.

580
01:31:55,792 --> 01:31:57,250
So, shall we lock your son up?

581
01:31:57,375 --> 01:31:58,875
Yeah, there is a case registered against him.

582
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:00,542
Answer them, dad.

583
01:32:00,708 --> 01:32:02,875
What do you want to know about Maari?-Keep quiet!

584
01:32:03,708 --> 01:32:04,708
Why are you scared?

585
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:06,042
What can he do to us?

586
01:32:06,375 --> 01:32:07,417
Ask me, sir.

587
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:10,625
Answer bravely, no one will know about this.

588
01:32:13,208 --> 01:32:16,125
Back then, Velu’s gang was not in power.

589
01:32:16,708 --> 01:32:17,833
There was a man called Pandi.

590
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:19,792
He was the top gun.

591
01:32:20,375 --> 01:32:22,708
Those two gangs never got along, sir.

592
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:26,208
One day, because of some issue...

593
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:29,083
They say Maari went and stabbed Pandi.

594
01:32:29,875 --> 01:32:32,000
Then it turned into a gang war...

595
01:32:32,292 --> 01:32:34,375
...and Pandi’s entire gang was wiped out.

596
01:32:34,667 --> 01:32:38,208
Since then, Velu’s hold over the area became stronger.

597
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:41,625
Do you know anyone who witnessed the killing?

598
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:42,500
No sir.

599
01:32:42,833 --> 01:32:45,833
I haven’t heard of anyone who witnessed Maari committing the murder.

600
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:48,083
The case wasn’t registered.

601
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:51,417
Then when Velu came to power, he wiped it clean.

602
01:32:51,667 --> 01:32:52,375
How is that?

603
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:54,917
They have killed a man who was in power.

604
01:32:55,375 --> 01:32:57,292
Maari became a gangster only after that.

605
01:32:57,958 --> 01:32:59,500
The whole area is scared of him.

606
01:33:00,625 --> 01:33:03,458
But no one knows who finished him, or how.

607
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:04,667
How would we know?

608
01:33:05,125 --> 01:33:06,833
It never happened.

609
01:33:08,042 --> 01:33:09,042
Think about it, sir…

610
01:33:09,458 --> 01:33:13,083
A murder like this is a matter of pride for a gangster.

611
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:15,917
Then why is it still a rumour?

612
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,083
Because it never happened, sir.

613
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:19,625
He’s just building up, sir.

614
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,125
Don’t believe any of it.

615
01:33:25,083 --> 01:33:28,958
Sri dear. Hello! Have you come to see Maari?

616
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:31,000
Why have you come with your mom?

617
01:33:31,583 --> 01:33:33,458
Maari, petty shop is here with mummy.

618
01:33:34,417 --> 01:33:35,083
Greetings, sir.

619
01:33:35,417 --> 01:33:37,042
We didn’t know who you were.

620
01:33:37,375 --> 01:33:39,625
We started on the wrong foot when we moved in.

621
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:42,375
We’ll pay you your fees.

622
01:33:42,708 --> 01:33:44,792
Just give us some time.

623
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:46,958
We were wealthy back in Delhi.

624
01:33:47,292 --> 01:33:48,792
Met a huge loss in business.

625
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,083
So we’re a little broke now.

626
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:52,500
We go broke too, spending on booze every night.

627
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:54,458
We just need some time.

628
01:33:54,792 --> 01:33:56,667
I think he is still pissed with us.

629
01:33:56,917 --> 01:33:59,042
We came to apologize.

630
01:34:03,417 --> 01:34:05,500
Your daughter doesn’t look like it.

631
01:34:07,083 --> 01:34:08,542
Say ‘sorry’.

632
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:09,750
Sorry.

633
01:34:10,917 --> 01:34:12,250
I didn’t know who you were.

634
01:34:12,458 --> 01:34:13,708
I misbehaved.

635
01:34:14,208 --> 01:34:15,583
Now you know who he is.

636
01:34:16,458 --> 01:34:17,458
How did you behave?

637
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:18,625
Angrily.

638
01:34:19,542 --> 01:34:20,417
You were cheeky.

639
01:34:21,708 --> 01:34:22,917
Yes. Cheeky.

640
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:24,167
And insolent.

641
01:34:24,917 --> 01:34:26,917
Yes. I was insolent.

642
01:34:27,458 --> 01:34:29,583
Like you were some big shot.

643
01:34:31,417 --> 01:34:33,917
Yes. I acted like I was a big shot.

644
01:34:36,292 --> 01:34:39,250
Don’t roll your eyes. They might pop out and fall down.

645
01:34:40,208 --> 01:34:42,167
Look at that. It looks freaky.

646
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:45,458
Sorry.

647
01:34:50,125 --> 01:34:51,458
I forgive you. Go.

648
01:34:52,167 --> 01:34:53,750
Maari forgives you. Go.

649
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,042
So, can we pay the rest later?

650
01:34:57,917 --> 01:34:58,708
No need to pay up.

651
01:34:58,750 --> 01:34:59,833
I expected-- Thank you!

652
01:35:00,083 --> 01:35:04,250
See, if you’re nice to the bosses, they’re helpful.

653
01:35:04,583 --> 01:35:06,583
Instead, take me as a partner in your shop.

654
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:07,542
Unexpected!

655
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:11,417
Take me as a partner in your shop.

656
01:35:11,833 --> 01:35:14,000
I’ll collect my remaining money that way.

657
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:17,833
Move.

658
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,667
What’s he saying? Partner?

659
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:25,625
It’s all good.

660
01:35:26,125 --> 01:35:27,208
It’s not your shop anymore.

661
01:35:27,625 --> 01:35:29,167
It’s our shop. Congrats.

662
01:35:34,917 --> 01:35:36,958
It’s an auspicious day.

663
01:35:37,083 --> 01:35:38,875
We’re partners henceforth. Okay?

664
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:39,833
Shake hands.

665
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,625
We call ourselves partners...

666
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:52,167
But how do we let the world know?

667
01:35:52,375 --> 01:35:53,833
Look at that girl standing there.

668
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:55,833
Do something about it, Maari.

669
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:57,083
Change it.

670
01:35:59,458 --> 01:36:02,125
“Punching Bag”, is this okay?-Not really.

671
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:03,042
Get lost.

672
01:36:04,083 --> 01:36:05,458
Brother, this one?

673
01:36:07,042 --> 01:36:08,708
Yeah, perfect.

674
01:36:15,208 --> 01:36:16,208
No more porn for you!

675
01:36:17,667 --> 01:36:19,667
Don’t mind them, just work.

676
01:36:23,667 --> 01:36:27,750
Maari, customers are here, please –- Hey, guests are all here, bring coffee.

677
01:36:28,292 --> 01:36:29,292
Get coffee!

678
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,958
Why is this girl dressed in a lungi?

679
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:37,500
This design is nice.

680
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:38,792
You’re a customer?

681
01:36:39,125 --> 01:36:40,583
See, same piece.

682
01:36:41,292 --> 01:36:43,125
It’s roomy, wear it. Very breezy.

683
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,625
Wait!

684
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:47,667
Don’t feel bad.

685
01:37:03,292 --> 01:37:04,875
Who’s the referee for our loft?

686
01:37:05,167 --> 01:37:06,792
Who else for Maari’s loft?

687
01:37:07,292 --> 01:37:08,292
I’ll be coming.

688
01:37:22,167 --> 01:37:23,417
Take care.- Okay, Maari.

689
01:37:24,458 --> 01:37:25,750
Is the boy ready?

690
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,458
Want me to tell him about the missing birds?

691
01:37:28,667 --> 01:37:29,500
You know about it?

692
01:37:31,125 --> 01:37:32,083
Is this Maari’s loft?

693
01:37:32,125 --> 01:37:32,958
Maari?

694
01:37:33,708 --> 01:37:34,708
Say Maari annan.

695
01:37:34,833 --> 01:37:37,500
Mister, who are you?- Your usual referee...

696
01:37:38,208 --> 01:37:39,250
...has gone to another loft.

697
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:40,708
So they sent me here.

698
01:37:40,792 --> 01:37:44,250
How can they do that? It’s wrong.Wait, I’ll call up “Bird” Ravi.

699
01:37:44,417 --> 01:37:46,000
Is a tournament happening here?

700
01:37:46,708 --> 01:37:48,583
Yes, Ravi his organizing it.

701
01:37:48,917 --> 01:37:50,458
Who? “Bird” Ravi?

702
01:37:51,083 --> 01:37:52,542
Has Maari lost his clout?

703
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:04,042
Look at that flip! That’s my boy.

704
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:08,708
What’s he scribbling?

705
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
It was a foul.

706
01:38:10,083 --> 01:38:11,542
What? A foul?

707
01:38:11,708 --> 01:38:14,250
He’s making such solid flips.Calling it a foul?

708
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
He tumbled correctly.

709
01:38:16,375 --> 01:38:18,125
Are you kidding me? Look closely.

710
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:19,292
I’m warning you once…

711
01:38:19,708 --> 01:38:21,583
If he does it wrong again, you’re out.

712
01:38:21,833 --> 01:38:23,750
You’ll disqualify our pigeon?

713
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,708
Saturday.

714
01:38:29,167 --> 01:38:31,167
Come on. Did you see that?

715
01:38:31,375 --> 01:38:32,375
No, no, no.

716
01:38:32,917 --> 01:38:34,375
His movements are erratic.

717
01:38:34,792 --> 01:38:35,792
There is no form.

718
01:38:35,917 --> 01:38:36,833
This one is disqualified.

719
01:38:36,958 --> 01:38:39,750
This one has won contests in the last three years.

720
01:38:39,833 --> 01:38:40,667
So what?

721
01:38:40,792 --> 01:38:42,042
He did it wrong this year.

722
01:38:42,417 --> 01:38:43,250
Disqualified.

723
01:38:43,708 --> 01:38:44,958
I can’t bluff for you guys.

724
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:46,875
Who’s bluffing here?

725
01:38:47,125 --> 01:38:47,875
Careful!

726
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,542
Stop. No fighting in the tournament.

727
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:51,833
You tell him oldie…

728
01:38:52,167 --> 01:38:53,458
Don’t know to raise pigeons!

729
01:38:53,792 --> 01:38:54,875
They just threaten us.

730
01:38:55,708 --> 01:38:57,917
Oh, is that so? One minute.

731
01:38:58,833 --> 01:39:00,083
Let those pigeons out.

732
01:39:02,125 --> 01:39:04,125
Which is the Tumbler, and which is the High Flyer here?

733
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:04,792
Why?

734
01:39:05,125 --> 01:39:06,208
Just tell me.

735
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:09,667
Here, this is the Tumbler.

736
01:39:11,083 --> 01:39:13,625
With the way you looked up at the sky,

737
01:39:13,833 --> 01:39:15,417
I could tell you were a fraud.

738
01:39:15,667 --> 01:39:18,125
None of these are Tumblers.

739
01:39:18,542 --> 01:39:21,667
I knew something was fishy when they sent a new guy instead of a neutral party.

740
01:39:21,792 --> 01:39:23,417
You’d disqualify our pigeon..

741
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:27,208
..we protest, and you call Maari’s men cheats.Was that your plan?

742
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,042
See our product? Thirty years of experience. He caught you red handed.

743
01:39:32,167 --> 01:39:33,625
It’s not that…

744
01:39:34,083 --> 01:39:35,792
You said something a while back.

745
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:37,917
What?

746
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:43,667
Something about raising pigeons.

747
01:39:43,833 --> 01:39:45,208
No, didn’t say anything.

748
01:39:47,917 --> 01:39:48,917
I heard you.

749
01:39:49,792 --> 01:39:50,625
Just say it.

750
01:39:51,292 --> 01:39:55,000
If the pigeon had tumbled right, we’d have no problem…

751
01:39:56,083 --> 01:39:57,792
Is that what he said?- I think so.

752
01:39:58,208 --> 01:39:58,833
Ouch.

753
01:40:01,083 --> 01:40:02,208
Am I deaf?

754
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:04,333
He said something else.

755
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:05,792
Tell him.

756
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:08,083
You said something a while back.

757
01:40:08,583 --> 01:40:09,250
Say that.

758
01:40:09,958 --> 01:40:12,333
I said you didn’t know to raise pigeons… but threatened…

759
01:40:12,667 --> 01:40:14,417
I didn’t know… So I said…

760
01:40:14,542 --> 01:40:16,000
How can you say without knowing?

761
01:40:17,375 --> 01:40:20,250
So you’re saying my pigeon can’t tumble.

762
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:24,375
How should one tumble? You tell me.

763
01:40:24,583 --> 01:40:27,542
It needs to fly up... and turn like that, and this way…

764
01:40:27,625 --> 01:40:29,667
I don’t know how to explain it.

765
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:33,958
If you can’t explain, then demonstrate.

766
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:10,500
Wasn’t that a perfect somersault?-Yes, it was.

767
01:41:13,125 --> 01:41:16,250
Not man enough to face me, but trying to plot a sketch.

768
01:41:18,292 --> 01:41:19,667
I’ll finish him off.

769
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:39,583
This a petty issue, why should you waste time on this?

770
01:41:39,917 --> 01:41:40,917
What’s a petty issue?

771
01:41:41,083 --> 01:41:42,625
Would you be quiet if someone hits your guy?

772
01:41:44,292 --> 01:41:46,583
I wouldn’t have let anyone to hit my guy.

773
01:41:47,875 --> 01:41:49,083
What Ravi did was wrong.

774
01:41:49,708 --> 01:41:52,458
Even if there was a shortage, you shouldn’t have sent an amateur to referee.

775
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:53,792
There was no shortage.

776
01:41:54,083 --> 01:41:56,167
Their plan was to disqualify our pigeon.

777
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:58,250
Just shut up.

778
01:41:58,708 --> 01:41:59,417
You tell us, anna.

779
01:41:59,542 --> 01:42:01,583
No matter what, you shouldn’t have fought.

780
01:42:01,708 --> 01:42:04,500
Should have either talked it out or come straight to me.

781
01:42:04,542 --> 01:42:05,542
Talked it out?

782
01:42:06,708 --> 01:42:07,792
Hey, tell anna what you told me.

783
01:42:08,042 --> 01:42:09,000
What did you say?

784
01:42:09,208 --> 01:42:11,833
I said they didn’t know to raise pigeons but they threaten.

785
01:42:11,958 --> 01:42:13,333
I breathe to raise pigeons.

786
01:42:13,375 --> 01:42:15,042
Would I keep mum when he says that?

787
01:42:15,167 --> 01:42:18,167
Would you have kept quiet if someone said it to you?- I’d have slaughtered him.

788
01:42:19,542 --> 01:42:21,958
If you still think it’s my fault, tell me what to do.

789
01:42:22,083 --> 01:42:24,083
Anna, Maari shouldn’t organize tournaments anymore.

790
01:42:25,625 --> 01:42:26,875
I’ll decide that.

791
01:42:27,292 --> 01:42:28,500
Both of you are at fault.

792
01:42:29,667 --> 01:42:31,667
All this started because you organized the tournament.

793
01:42:32,208 --> 01:42:34,250
Let Maari organize it as always.

794
01:42:35,042 --> 01:42:38,667
Shake hands and mind your own jobs.

795
01:42:38,792 --> 01:42:41,417
No, anna- Hey! Do as I say. Get up.

796
01:42:42,583 --> 01:42:43,250
Shake hands.

797
01:42:43,625 --> 01:42:44,750
Spit on it.

798
01:42:47,292 --> 01:42:49,458
You’ve changed these days, anna.

799
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:56,167
Anna, I’ve been asking you for a while now.

800
01:42:56,625 --> 01:42:57,083
What?

801
01:42:57,417 --> 01:42:59,417
I told you. I’ve found a link.

802
01:42:59,708 --> 01:43:01,708
The demand over red sanders is increasing by the day.

803
01:43:01,958 --> 01:43:03,375
If you could let me do it too...

804
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:06,625
You can’t even organize a tournament without hassles.

805
01:43:06,917 --> 01:43:07,750
And you want to do this?

806
01:43:08,375 --> 01:43:10,792
Just mind your job, I’ll take care of it.

807
01:43:17,375 --> 01:43:18,375
Welcome.

808
01:43:20,917 --> 01:43:21,917
Welcome.

809
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Please come.

810
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:25,708
I saw your designs on your Facebook page.

811
01:43:26,583 --> 01:43:28,542
Your designs have a personal touch.

812
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:30,375
We don’t find that in big stores.

813
01:43:30,542 --> 01:43:32,208
Thank you. Thank you so much.

814
01:43:33,083 --> 01:43:36,042
We’ll shop for both the Receptionand Mehendi here itself?

815
01:43:36,333 --> 01:43:38,042
Okay, dear. Whatever you say.

816
01:43:39,458 --> 01:43:42,708
I’m buying all my friends identical sarees.

817
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,458
You need to design that too.

818
01:43:44,708 --> 01:43:46,250
For sure! We’ll do a super job.

819
01:43:53,542 --> 01:43:54,375
Very good fabric.

820
01:43:54,583 --> 01:43:56,500
Morning fuctions--Is that a customer?

821
01:43:57,792 --> 01:43:58,500
Yes.

822
01:44:01,083 --> 01:44:02,542
I am Maari.- Hi.

823
01:44:02,667 --> 01:44:04,125
One of this shop’s business partners.

824
01:44:04,625 --> 01:44:06,542
Hello sir, myself Swaminathan.

825
01:44:06,667 --> 01:44:07,417
Let it be.

826
01:44:07,667 --> 01:44:09,958
I’m a partner in my dad’s business.

827
01:44:10,708 --> 01:44:11,542
Jewellery shop.

828
01:44:11,708 --> 01:44:12,417
He’s a goner.

829
01:44:13,292 --> 01:44:14,333
Really?- Yeah, sir.

830
01:44:14,583 --> 01:44:15,583
Okay, okay.

831
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:16,917
I found the ad on Facebook.

832
01:44:17,167 --> 01:44:18,583
You’ve come to the right place.

833
01:44:18,958 --> 01:44:19,958
Marriage on the 23rd...

834
01:44:20,167 --> 01:44:21,625
I’m doing Mehendi on the 22nd.

835
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:22,333
Rascal.

836
01:44:22,375 --> 01:44:25,708
Talking about doing some girl called Mehendiwhen your bride is here.

837
01:44:25,917 --> 01:44:27,250
No, it’s not that.

838
01:44:27,458 --> 01:44:29,750
I meant the henna function.

839
01:44:30,708 --> 01:44:32,500
Say sorry to him.- Sorry.

840
01:44:34,708 --> 01:44:36,875
He’s got a separate henna function.

841
01:44:36,917 --> 01:44:39,333
Some of us can’t even afford our weddings.

842
01:44:40,958 --> 01:44:41,417
Smile, powder-face.

843
01:44:43,042 --> 01:44:44,750
What?- You said 'smile'!

844
01:44:44,958 --> 01:44:46,458
I was talking to her!

845
01:44:47,333 --> 01:44:49,708
Sridevi! Discussed the rates yet?

846
01:44:50,042 --> 01:44:50,417
No.

847
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:51,750
They’re looking at the designs.

848
01:44:52,292 --> 01:44:54,958
Let them look. But I’ll fix the rates, okay?

849
01:44:57,667 --> 01:44:58,583
Okay?- Yes.

850
01:44:59,875 --> 01:45:00,875
So, here...

851
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,083
Wait, wait!

852
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,458
I told you I’ll fix rates!

853
01:45:04,708 --> 01:45:06,583
Taking decisions without your partner’s consent?

854
01:45:13,458 --> 01:45:14,958
Maari-- Here you go, sister.

855
01:45:17,292 --> 01:45:19,042
This is too much, sir!

856
01:45:19,208 --> 01:45:20,458
Our shop is special, ma’am.

857
01:45:20,667 --> 01:45:22,208
You have to pay its worth.

858
01:45:22,583 --> 01:45:24,667
Mr. Maari, this is unfair.

859
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:27,000
You!

860
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:27,542
What?

861
01:45:27,792 --> 01:45:28,375
Listen!

862
01:45:28,667 --> 01:45:29,917
You have a separate function to apply henna.

863
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
This seems more unfair to you?

864
01:45:31,083 --> 01:45:34,167
Okay, we’ll think about it and call you.

865
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,125
Yes, we’ll call you.

866
01:45:37,917 --> 01:45:38,375
Sit.

867
01:45:38,542 --> 01:45:40,000
Want instructions from the wife?

868
01:45:40,208 --> 01:45:41,167
Sit down.

869
01:45:43,542 --> 01:45:45,417
You have to buy from us.

870
01:45:45,667 --> 01:45:46,667
These are the rates.

871
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,583
Pay fifty percent upfront and fifty percent upon delivery.

872
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:53,500
Look, your partner is acting like a rowdy!

873
01:45:55,042 --> 01:45:56,417
Not “like a  rowdy”.

874
01:45:57,542 --> 01:45:58,375
I am a rowdy!

875
01:45:58,875 --> 01:45:59,792
Don’t hit me.

876
01:46:00,208 --> 01:46:01,875
I’ll pay you.- Don’t pay him.

877
01:46:03,958 --> 01:46:04,583
Saw that?

878
01:46:05,083 --> 01:46:06,250
This is how you do business.

879
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:08,458
How do I trust you with such a huge company?

880
01:46:09,125 --> 01:46:10,917
Send my cut across in the evening. Okay?

881
01:46:11,208 --> 01:46:13,708
He cries a river for this! All your training?

882
01:46:13,875 --> 01:46:16,875
Who hit you, sweetie? You look like Mr. Bean!

883
01:46:17,542 --> 01:46:18,333
Coming!

884
01:46:19,375 --> 01:46:21,042
Don’t cry, it’s embarrassing.- I’m sorry.

885
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:23,542
I didn’t expect them to behave this way.

886
01:46:28,333 --> 01:46:30,958
I have nightmares about death...

887
01:46:31,125 --> 01:46:33,125
…looking at death certificates all day.

888
01:46:33,625 --> 01:46:36,083
No suspicious deaths have occurred in the area, sir…

889
01:46:36,417 --> 01:46:39,750
…all of them match registered police records.

890
01:46:40,333 --> 01:46:41,583
I’ve checked those too.

891
01:46:41,875 --> 01:46:43,625
Nothing is connected to Maari.

892
01:46:44,708 --> 01:46:46,292
That murder never happened.

893
01:46:47,292 --> 01:46:49,000
Please drop this matter, sir.

894
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:57,083
Stop.

895
01:47:00,792 --> 01:47:04,708
Sree baby. Come here. Look who is here!

896
01:47:05,125 --> 01:47:06,625
What are you doing?-What?

897
01:47:07,875 --> 01:47:10,875
Partner, I haven’t received my cut yet.

898
01:47:11,292 --> 01:47:12,917
They called and cancelled the order.

899
01:47:13,042 --> 01:47:16,875
How dare they cancel the order…Who does he think he is?

900
01:47:17,042 --> 01:47:19,042
I’ll finish him off.- No, listen to me.

901
01:47:19,292 --> 01:47:22,292
They place their order here and bought elsewhere.How can we let it go?

902
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:23,875
They didn’t go elsewhere.

903
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:24,750
Then?

904
01:47:25,542 --> 01:47:26,750
The wedding has been called off.

905
01:47:27,292 --> 01:47:28,000
Why?

906
01:47:28,292 --> 01:47:31,083
When you threatened them and the guy cried...

907
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:35,167
...the girl fell out of love, it seems.

908
01:47:36,208 --> 01:47:37,208
She called off the wedding.

909
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:39,583
Good for him, or he’d have cried all his life.

910
01:47:39,875 --> 01:47:44,167
See, this thing with girls and love is dangerous.

911
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:47,083
You never know why or for what they’d ditch you.

912
01:47:47,958 --> 01:47:49,125
You’re spurting philosophies!

913
01:47:50,333 --> 01:47:51,208
Don’t laugh.

914
01:47:51,542 --> 01:47:54,333
I borrowed a huge sum to get the materials.

915
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:56,750
I wanted to pay off my debt with this money.

916
01:47:57,958 --> 01:48:00,375
Pay back your debt with the advance money I got you.

917
01:48:00,792 --> 01:48:02,500
I returned the money to them.

918
01:48:03,083 --> 01:48:03,542
Why?

919
01:48:04,292 --> 01:48:05,875
I only want to earn the right way.

920
01:48:12,083 --> 01:48:12,667
Look here.

921
01:48:13,083 --> 01:48:16,125
If you run the company this way,we won’t make any money.

922
01:48:16,208 --> 01:48:19,542
I have a lot of other businesses…You take care of your debt.

923
01:48:19,625 --> 01:48:20,917
I’m off now. Bye.

924
01:48:23,042 --> 01:48:23,667
Hey.

925
01:48:23,958 --> 01:48:24,458
What?

926
01:48:24,667 --> 01:48:25,542
She’s crying.

927
01:48:25,917 --> 01:48:27,458
I swear I didn’t do anything.

928
01:48:27,542 --> 01:48:28,417
What?

929
01:48:29,417 --> 01:48:31,125
Shouldn’t have let that money go.

930
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:32,708
Who did you borrow from?

931
01:48:33,167 --> 01:48:34,875
Through a friend of dad’s.

932
01:48:36,167 --> 01:48:37,500
Think his name is Ravi.

933
01:48:37,958 --> 01:48:39,667
It’s “Bird” Ravi.

934
01:48:39,875 --> 01:48:42,667
Very bad.- Your family, your problems.

935
01:48:43,125 --> 01:48:44,125
Let’s go.

936
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:56,667
Who are you?

937
01:48:56,792 --> 01:48:57,667
We’ve come to buy clothes.

938
01:48:57,792 --> 01:48:58,625
Buzz off.

939
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:01,250
Take it and throw it out.

940
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,042
Stop it, please.

941
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:11,167
Sir, my parents have gone out.

942
01:49:11,917 --> 01:49:12,750
It’s okay.

943
01:49:12,917 --> 01:49:14,167
They’re not needed.

944
01:49:14,583 --> 01:49:15,708
What are they doing?

945
01:49:15,917 --> 01:49:18,458
Vacating your store and opening ours.

946
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:21,000
Sir, we’re trying to pay off your debt.

947
01:49:21,417 --> 01:49:22,542
Business hasn’t picked up yet.

948
01:49:22,667 --> 01:49:25,042
Keep quiet, and we’d only touch the shop.

949
01:49:25,625 --> 01:49:26,333
Okay?

950
01:49:26,417 --> 01:49:28,000
Work faster, guys.

951
01:49:28,875 --> 01:49:30,292
Sir, please sir.

952
01:49:31,542 --> 01:49:33,208
I set it up with great difficulty.

953
01:49:33,583 --> 01:49:34,583
My dream, sir.

954
01:49:35,625 --> 01:49:36,083
Please.

955
01:49:37,792 --> 01:49:39,042
What’s the noise outside?

956
01:49:39,458 --> 01:49:40,042
Who’s that?

957
01:49:41,958 --> 01:49:42,417
Stop it.

958
01:49:43,458 --> 01:49:43,958
Stop it.

959
01:50:21,958 --> 01:50:24,167
Maari, you know what Velu anna would say?

960
01:50:24,417 --> 01:50:25,417
Hey Ravi.

961
01:50:25,625 --> 01:50:27,500
We’re following Velu anna’s orders.

962
01:50:27,708 --> 01:50:30,875
You touched our property, and we touched yours.

963
01:50:32,083 --> 01:50:33,292
This is our shop.

964
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:36,875
Haven’t you told Bird about our partnership?

965
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:39,250
Bird. "Bird Ravi" right?

966
01:50:39,958 --> 01:50:42,292
Look, we’ve lent her money.This is none of your business.

967
01:50:43,042 --> 01:50:44,542
You shouldn’t lend money to people in our area.

968
01:50:44,667 --> 01:50:46,250
On top of it you come to collect?

969
01:50:46,417 --> 01:50:47,417
Think we’ll stand by and watch?

970
01:50:47,625 --> 01:50:49,208
We'll finish you off.- Don't remove your t-shirt!

971
01:50:49,250 --> 01:50:50,625
We didn’t know this was your shop.

972
01:50:51,083 --> 01:50:53,167
Listen, big guy. You can’t come show off here.

973
01:50:53,292 --> 01:50:55,417
Velu anna has asked us not to fight.

974
01:50:55,583 --> 01:50:58,417
But keep showing up in our area...

975
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,958
...and anna will know what to do.

976
01:51:01,042 --> 01:51:01,750
Buzz off now!

977
01:51:03,125 --> 01:51:03,667
Breathe out.

978
01:51:03,917 --> 01:51:04,542
Breathe out!

979
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:05,708
Bloody bugger.

980
01:51:05,875 --> 01:51:08,542
Maari, should we fight for some chick?

981
01:51:09,542 --> 01:51:11,750
You are extorting her too.

982
01:51:20,375 --> 01:51:21,708
That girl is from my area.

983
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:23,583
I’ll extort her…

984
01:51:23,792 --> 01:51:24,583
…trouble her…

985
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:25,875
…do whatever I want.

986
01:51:26,333 --> 01:51:28,708
Take your boss, your men, and walk away.

987
01:51:29,125 --> 01:51:31,125
Maari, this is not done yet.

988
01:51:31,417 --> 01:51:32,625
If it's not done then buzz off, man.

989
01:51:35,792 --> 01:51:36,500
What was that?

990
01:51:37,625 --> 01:51:38,042
What?

991
01:51:41,792 --> 01:51:43,792
Don’t create a scene here. Just leave.

992
01:51:49,708 --> 01:51:50,375
Maari.

993
01:51:52,125 --> 01:51:53,125
Thanks a lot.

994
01:51:53,417 --> 01:51:55,333
See what I told you about?

995
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:56,542
Protection.

996
01:51:57,625 --> 01:51:58,625
Silly girl!

997
01:52:04,125 --> 01:52:06,167
Why did you pair them together? Idiot!

998
01:52:06,458 --> 01:52:07,750
He wanted to try.

999
01:52:07,875 --> 01:52:09,375
You’re a pigeon pimp now?

1000
01:52:09,583 --> 01:52:10,250
Keep it inside.

1001
01:52:11,458 --> 01:52:12,125
Hello.

1002
01:52:16,792 --> 01:52:17,458
What do you want?

1003
01:52:17,625 --> 01:52:20,000
After you warned them yesterday…

1004
01:52:20,417 --> 01:52:22,208
…they said they don’t want the money.

1005
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:24,083
I couldn’t believe it.

1006
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:25,625
I should thank you.

1007
01:52:26,208 --> 01:52:27,042
Okay, go.

1008
01:52:27,625 --> 01:52:32,167
I mistook you to only cause trouble to the area people.

1009
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:39,000
Now I understand that outsiders don’t mess with us, thanks to you

1010
01:52:39,208 --> 01:52:42,458
You’re not as bad as I thought.

1011
01:52:44,167 --> 01:52:45,625
You’re right.

1012
01:52:46,208 --> 01:52:48,250
I’m much worse than you thought.

1013
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:52,458
Stop flashing your teeth at me.Get off my back.

1014
01:52:52,875 --> 01:52:55,792
Maari. Poor girl, she is only trying to thank you.

1015
01:52:57,875 --> 01:52:57,917
Feeling bad for the lady now?

1016
01:52:58,625 --> 01:53:00,167
She hoodwinked that guy with his money.

1017
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:02,042
She is trying to do the same to us.

1018
01:53:03,583 --> 01:53:05,042
I’ll even work for you…

1019
01:53:05,333 --> 01:53:07,750
Till I can afford to pay you back.

1020
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:09,667
Are you mad?

1021
01:53:09,917 --> 01:53:12,083
Offering to work for money at a goon’s locale?

1022
01:53:12,792 --> 01:53:14,083
Wear your scarf properly.

1023
01:53:14,417 --> 01:53:17,417
Your scarf doesn’t even serve its purpose.

1024
01:53:17,875 --> 01:53:21,042
They said you don’t misbehave with ladies.

1025
01:53:21,458 --> 01:53:23,875
Or I wouldn’t have come to talk to you.

1026
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:26,083
This won’t work out.-It will!

1027
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:27,875
We’re all parched.

1028
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,250
Not just us, even the pigeons.

1029
01:53:29,458 --> 01:53:31,000
They must be tired of our faces.

1030
01:53:31,208 --> 01:53:33,250
They’ll be all excited if she comes.

1031
01:53:34,042 --> 01:53:36,000
She is a nice girl. Let her work here.

1032
01:53:36,542 --> 01:53:38,417
At least to make up for our sins.

1033
01:53:38,792 --> 01:53:41,417
How have we sinned?

1034
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:44,250
We’re so parched, Maari!

1035
01:53:57,875 --> 01:54:00,000
What’s with the sudden interest?

1036
01:54:01,292 --> 01:54:02,167
Not sudden…

1037
01:54:02,667 --> 01:54:03,667
…I’ve been interested…

1038
01:54:04,125 --> 01:54:07,292
…ever since I saw you fly pigeons.

1039
01:54:07,792 --> 01:54:10,375
When you win, you’d hold the pigeon...

1040
01:54:10,583 --> 01:54:13,125
...and stand mighty, and high.

1041
01:54:13,875 --> 01:54:16,625
I really liked seeing you like that. Hence.

1042
01:54:18,542 --> 01:54:19,542
I’ll come from tomorrow.

1043
01:54:20,042 --> 01:54:20,583
Bye.

1044
01:54:27,375 --> 01:54:29,458
Hear that? She likes seeing, it seems.

1045
01:54:30,167 --> 01:54:32,000
She meant the pigeons, you rascal.

1046
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:45,042
I'm your don don don;And I am your Golden fish.

1047
01:54:45,083 --> 01:54:47,667
Here's the scene scene scene;Touch me and I'll make a scene.

1048
01:54:47,875 --> 01:54:50,250
You're a little deer, my dear;I'm the caffeine in your coffee.

1049
01:54:50,542 --> 01:54:53,083
You're gone gone gone;I'm a goner when you look at me.

1050
01:54:53,208 --> 01:54:58,167
Don't you pierce me with those sharp eyes;I want all of you, and more.

1051
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:03,500
Your rosy skin sweeps me off my feet;I'm no match for you, baby.

1052
01:55:03,875 --> 01:55:09,000
Your masculinity melts me down;The bird in me has lost it's flight.

1053
01:55:09,208 --> 01:55:14,250
While I yearn to cross the line;This coyness holds me back.

1054
01:55:14,542 --> 01:55:15,542
I melt away...

1055
01:55:17,125 --> 01:55:18,167
I fade away…

1056
01:55:19,792 --> 01:55:20,792
I yearn...

1057
01:55:22,542 --> 01:55:25,042
Yet, this coyness holds me back.

1058
01:55:35,375 --> 01:55:38,000
I am a loyal husband;Giving you royal treatment.

1059
01:55:38,167 --> 01:55:40,625
And your daily shopping is guaranteed

1060
01:55:40,917 --> 01:55:43,417
O' my mustachioed man!I am your spouse and am naughty.

1061
01:55:43,542 --> 01:55:46,292
Giving you a lifetime service warranty.

1062
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:51,750
My dear twinkle! Come, let's mingle.I'm the king of our own forest.

1063
01:55:51,875 --> 01:55:56,583
Oh my lover boy, has Cupid's arrow struck you?When it happens, give me a ring.

1064
01:55:56,875 --> 01:55:59,083
I'm choking, stammering;Shivering, here in solitude.

1065
01:55:59,167 --> 01:56:00,167
Don’t you see him collecting it?

1066
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:01,250
You’re my partner.

1067
01:56:01,625 --> 01:56:02,625
I’ll only pay you.

1068
01:56:02,625 --> 01:56:07,625
I feel trapped, I feel the heat;I'm ready for a one on one, baby.

1069
01:56:07,792 --> 01:56:09,167
I melt away...

1070
01:56:10,458 --> 01:56:11,750
I fade away...

1071
01:56:13,083 --> 01:56:14,250
I shiver...

1072
01:56:15,542 --> 01:56:18,292
Yet, coyness holds me back.

1073
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,708
Is it nice? I stitched it myself.

1074
01:56:56,667 --> 01:56:57,417
Thanks.

1075
01:56:57,917 --> 01:56:58,500
See you, brother.

1076
01:56:58,875 --> 01:57:01,042
Why do you call me brother, but not Maari?

1077
01:57:01,292 --> 01:57:03,708
Calling him brother doesn’t come naturally to me.

1078
01:57:32,208 --> 01:57:33,333
Look here Maari.

1079
01:57:34,417 --> 01:57:36,292
This is romance for sure.

1080
01:57:36,458 --> 01:57:37,875
She is ogling at you.

1081
01:57:39,292 --> 01:57:41,500
She looks like a movie star, why would she check me out?

1082
01:57:42,792 --> 01:57:44,208
You don’t understand your worth…

1083
01:57:46,042 --> 01:57:46,917
I get that…

1084
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:50,458
But we’ve troubled her so much.How could she like me?

1085
01:57:50,667 --> 01:57:53,292
You just don’t get it.

1086
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:58,333
The first step to picking up a chick is to torture her.

1087
01:57:59,042 --> 01:58:02,375
Somehow you’ve got that right.

1088
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:06,667
Girls dig bad boys like you and me.

1089
01:58:07,083 --> 01:58:09,125
At first sight, I am not a likeable guy.

1090
01:58:09,333 --> 01:58:10,583
Are you likeable at second glance?

1091
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:12,750
No one even gives me a second glance!

1092
01:58:14,542 --> 01:58:16,500
Say the girl likes me…

1093
01:58:16,917 --> 01:58:18,083
I should like her too, right?

1094
01:58:18,208 --> 01:58:19,708
She’s a show off. It won’t work out.

1095
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,917
Don’t say that. She’s a nice girl.

1096
01:58:22,375 --> 01:58:24,500
She and you are ‘Made In China’.

1097
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:26,375
Boss, you mean ‘made for each other’?

1098
01:58:26,583 --> 01:58:29,833
You’re old school! What I mean is….

1099
01:58:31,750 --> 01:58:33,875
Only I get to hit him!-That’s your fate.

1100
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:36,917
I think she’s a fine chick.

1101
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:38,917
She’s so dainty…

1102
01:58:39,208 --> 01:58:42,208
She’d get rosy if you pinch her!

1103
01:58:42,583 --> 01:58:47,167
When I see her, I just meltand can’t control myself, Maari.

1104
01:58:47,875 --> 01:58:48,458
What?

1105
01:58:48,583 --> 01:58:51,250
Will you find another girl like that?

1106
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:52,375
Yes, anna.

1107
01:58:52,667 --> 01:58:54,458
The whole area is ogling at that girl.

1108
01:58:54,750 --> 01:58:57,125
But she has eyes only for you.

1109
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:58,750
You’re lucky.

1110
01:58:59,292 --> 01:59:00,333
Give it a try!

1111
01:59:06,542 --> 01:59:07,917
Am I right for the girl?

1112
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Of course you're not...

1113
01:59:09,625 --> 01:59:10,542
We know that.

1114
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:12,667
But that powder-faced girl doesn't seem to realise it!

1115
01:59:12,792 --> 01:59:14,042
Someone’s going to get beaten up now.

1116
01:59:15,917 --> 01:59:20,042
So many girls fall for the wrong men and suffer;

1117
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:23,125
Add your name to the list of wrong men.

1118
01:59:24,375 --> 01:59:25,375
No, Maari...

1119
01:59:25,958 --> 01:59:28,000
She’ll never find a handsome groom…

1120
01:59:28,917 --> 01:59:29,417
God!

1121
01:59:29,958 --> 01:59:33,458
She’ll never find another groom like you, Maari.

1122
01:59:33,875 --> 01:59:34,667
Definitely, anna!

1123
01:59:36,375 --> 01:59:40,417
You’re sitting me downand using this chance to pull my leg?

1124
01:59:41,250 --> 01:59:42,458
I’ll keep that in mind.

1125
01:59:44,542 --> 01:59:46,917
How do I explain this…?

1126
01:59:48,083 --> 01:59:51,917
When it’s just us guys, there are no issues.

1127
01:59:52,083 --> 01:59:54,250
You can just be free and happy.

1128
01:59:54,542 --> 01:59:57,083
When women enter the picture, it gets messy.

1129
01:59:57,208 --> 01:59:59,750
I don’t think this will work.

1130
02:00:00,583 --> 02:00:01,583
Won’t work out.

1131
02:00:01,708 --> 02:00:03,208
It will work, Maari.

1132
02:00:03,292 --> 02:00:04,417
Maari- Sri.

1133
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:07,375
Sri-Maari. It’s a good combination.- Shut up!

1134
02:00:08,375 --> 02:00:11,083
Just meet her in person and say “I love you”.

1135
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,333
If there’s a problem?- He’s the one who gets in trouble.

1136
02:00:22,375 --> 02:00:23,417
Go!

1137
02:00:28,375 --> 02:00:29,417
You go away, too.

1138
02:00:30,125 --> 02:00:31,208
There’s no one but us.

1139
02:00:33,042 --> 02:00:34,875
You only. Go!

1140
02:00:36,542 --> 02:00:37,792
Why did he bring us along then?

1141
02:00:41,917 --> 02:00:42,917
The shirt I gave you.

1142
02:00:42,958 --> 02:00:44,250
Finally warmed up to it?

1143
02:00:45,708 --> 02:00:46,667
Fits you so well.

1144
02:00:46,708 --> 02:00:48,125
You look smart, you know?

1145
02:00:51,458 --> 02:00:52,583
It seems you like me.

1146
02:00:53,375 --> 02:00:55,042
So I’ve decided to love you.

1147
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:01,875
First time I saw you, I wanted to slap you.

1148
02:01:02,375 --> 02:01:04,625
But then I saw the way you were with the pigeons…

1149
02:01:06,792 --> 02:01:08,125
So… I love you.

1150
02:01:09,375 --> 02:01:10,000
What?

1151
02:01:11,042 --> 02:01:12,250
I didn’t say it right?

1152
02:01:12,792 --> 02:01:13,708
I’ll say it differently.

1153
02:01:13,875 --> 02:01:14,583
I love you.

1154
02:01:15,042 --> 02:01:16,042
I love you. I love you!

1155
02:01:17,250 --> 02:01:18,250
I’m so sorry.

1156
02:01:18,750 --> 02:01:20,500
I think you’ve misunderstood.

1157
02:01:20,875 --> 02:01:23,500
I had no such intentions with you.

1158
02:01:24,042 --> 02:01:26,042
I’m sorry if I gave you that idea.

1159
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:27,250
Oh, you don’t?

1160
02:01:27,583 --> 02:01:29,250
Okay, we’ll drop the matter.

1161
02:01:29,375 --> 02:01:30,875
I told them so!

1162
02:01:31,167 --> 02:01:34,042
But the fools got me excited and confused.

1163
02:01:34,250 --> 02:01:36,167
Okay, let’s mind our work. Bye!

1164
02:01:36,417 --> 02:01:37,708
Stop!–What?

1165
02:01:38,292 --> 02:01:40,083
Don’t mistake me.

1166
02:01:40,958 --> 02:01:42,458
It’s not that I don’t like you.

1167
02:01:42,875 --> 02:01:43,958
So you like me?

1168
02:01:44,667 --> 02:01:47,125
I do…- Then “I love you”, let’s love each other!

1169
02:01:47,833 --> 02:01:50,500
No, I like you. As a person.

1170
02:01:51,167 --> 02:01:53,667
This has to be personal.Can’t do this in public!

1171
02:01:54,125 --> 02:01:56,292
But I don’t even know anything about you.

1172
02:01:56,917 --> 02:01:59,583
What do you do? What are you like?

1173
02:02:00,250 --> 02:02:02,292
What do I do? What am I like?

1174
02:02:03,250 --> 02:02:05,625
I wake up in the morning and hang out with the pigeons.

1175
02:02:05,792 --> 02:02:06,833
Then I go to meet Velu anna.

1176
02:02:06,958 --> 02:02:08,708
If he gives me some work, I do it.

1177
02:02:08,792 --> 02:02:10,750
Then the boys come over. I just have fun with them.

1178
02:02:10,875 --> 02:02:12,042
I get drunk at nights and fall asleep.

1179
02:02:12,167 --> 02:02:14,167
Then I wake up in the morning, and hang out with the pigeons.

1180
02:02:14,250 --> 02:02:16,750
Then I go to meet Velu annan. If he gives me some work, I do it.

1181
02:02:16,833 --> 02:02:19,500
Then the boys come over, I have fun, get drunk and sleep.

1182
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:20,500
That’s all I am.

1183
02:02:20,542 --> 02:02:21,792
It’s not that!

1184
02:02:22,083 --> 02:02:23,375
How do I explain…

1185
02:02:24,458 --> 02:02:26,458
Even if you’re a good person

1186
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:28,042
You’re a rowdy!

1187
02:02:28,417 --> 02:02:30,000
I would be scared, right?

1188
02:02:30,875 --> 02:02:32,792
How will my parents ever accept?

1189
02:02:33,375 --> 02:02:34,375
We’ll finish them off?

1190
02:02:36,958 --> 02:02:37,750
No!

1191
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:39,542
I don’t know you well enough.

1192
02:02:39,792 --> 02:02:41,083
How can I trust you?

1193
02:02:41,292 --> 02:02:42,625
You don’t need to trust me.

1194
02:02:42,875 --> 02:02:43,708
Let this go.

1195
02:02:43,750 --> 02:02:45,375
Don’t let it confuse you. Bye!

1196
02:03:04,042 --> 02:03:05,042
Maari!

1197
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,667
Something wrong.

1198
02:03:08,667 --> 02:03:09,708
Not there!

1199
02:03:10,542 --> 02:03:12,333
Why doesn’t that girl like you?

1200
02:03:12,417 --> 02:03:13,542
I don’t know, man.

1201
02:03:13,833 --> 02:03:15,375
Did you tell her properly?

1202
02:03:16,583 --> 02:03:18,958
I told her “I love you” in every possible way!

1203
02:03:19,375 --> 02:03:21,250
That’s not how you say it, Maari!

1204
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:23,625
I…

1205
02:03:23,958 --> 02:03:25,208
Love…

1206
02:03:25,583 --> 02:03:27,208
You!

1207
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:29,000
Goes that way!

1208
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:31,625
Why do you split it in three like that?

1209
02:03:31,792 --> 02:03:34,292
Because it’s three words!

1210
02:03:34,417 --> 02:03:34,958
What?

1211
02:03:36,167 --> 02:03:37,917
“I  love you” is not a single word?

1212
02:03:38,042 --> 02:03:40,042
Three words, Maari!– Not one word?

1213
02:03:41,292 --> 02:03:43,542
Why didn’t you tell me that before, you Saturday!

1214
02:03:48,333 --> 02:03:49,792
Why have you brought this girl here?

1215
02:03:49,875 --> 02:03:51,625
She wanted to talk to you, brother.

1216
02:03:55,083 --> 02:03:57,333
You’ve come to develop our friendship?

1217
02:03:57,750 --> 02:03:58,750
Have a seat, buddy.

1218
02:03:59,042 --> 02:03:59,917
Hey, off you go!

1219
02:04:00,125 --> 02:04:01,792
Buzz off, both of you. Come in the morning.

1220
02:04:01,958 --> 02:04:02,958
Sit here.

1221
02:04:03,708 --> 02:04:04,750
I’ll pour you a drink?- No!

1222
02:04:04,958 --> 02:04:06,542
She must be drunk already.

1223
02:04:07,167 --> 02:04:08,750
You only drink in star hotels.

1224
02:04:08,875 --> 02:04:11,042
I need to talk to you.

1225
02:04:11,375 --> 02:04:12,000
Talk away.

1226
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,625
I didn’t tell you that I don’t like you.

1227
02:04:16,167 --> 02:04:18,167
I just wanted to know more about you.

1228
02:04:18,417 --> 02:04:19,750
But you had left by then.

1229
02:04:20,875 --> 02:04:21,875
What do you want to know?

1230
02:04:22,042 --> 02:04:23,542
Who are you?

1231
02:04:24,333 --> 02:04:25,542
How did you turn out this way?

1232
02:04:28,417 --> 02:04:29,417
Turn out what way?

1233
02:04:30,792 --> 02:04:31,917
Turn out what way?

1234
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,958
No, everyone fears you.

1235
02:04:35,625 --> 02:04:36,583
Including me.

1236
02:04:38,167 --> 02:04:40,000
Do I look like a rapist?

1237
02:04:42,042 --> 02:04:43,917
Only gutless men rape.

1238
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:45,500
I am a real man.

1239
02:04:46,083 --> 02:04:47,875
Real men don’t rape.

1240
02:04:48,250 --> 02:04:49,125
No...

1241
02:04:49,583 --> 02:04:50,875
I know about you…

1242
02:04:51,458 --> 02:04:53,042
But everyone is so scared of you.

1243
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:54,708
There must be some reason.

1244
02:04:55,250 --> 02:04:56,083
Violence.

1245
02:04:57,375 --> 02:04:58,250
Murder.

1246
02:05:00,833 --> 02:05:01,542
Murder?

1247
02:05:06,375 --> 02:05:07,458
Nothing of that sort.

1248
02:05:18,167 --> 02:05:21,958
Murder…can’t really call it a murder.

1249
02:05:26,083 --> 02:05:29,625
Murder… Something like murder.

1250
02:05:30,167 --> 02:05:32,042
Pretty much murder.

1251
02:05:33,958 --> 02:05:35,583
There was this guy called Pandi.

1252
02:05:36,792 --> 02:05:37,750
Real big shot.

1253
02:05:37,833 --> 02:05:39,583
Not any one could have laid a finger on him.

1254
02:05:39,750 --> 02:05:41,708
One day I just went and casually stabbed him.

1255
02:05:46,292 --> 02:05:48,750
But he didn’t die. So it doesn’t count as murder.

1256
02:05:49,292 --> 02:05:51,708
Someone else finished him off two days later.

1257
02:05:51,917 --> 02:05:53,625
But I got all the credit.

1258
02:06:00,417 --> 02:06:02,917
It won’t work out. Go home and think all night.

1259
02:06:03,167 --> 02:06:05,250
If it’s okay, it’s okay. Else, just drop it.

1260
02:06:05,417 --> 02:06:07,917
Stop bothering me. Okay?

1261
02:06:09,250 --> 02:06:11,125
Get out.

1262
02:06:22,958 --> 02:06:24,583
Why is the police here without permission?

1263
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,375
Don’t yell, man. He’s come with a warrant.

1264
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,292
Maari’s asleep. Come back later.-Don't yell!

1265
02:06:32,292 --> 02:06:34,000
Don’t make a sound or I’ll kill you.

1266
02:06:35,167 --> 02:06:37,083
We’ve got a warrant against you.

1267
02:06:37,125 --> 02:06:38,667
Officer asked me to bring you in.

1268
02:06:38,792 --> 02:06:39,792
Who is the officer?

1269
02:06:53,125 --> 02:06:56,875
Hey “Punching Bag”, wake me up. I’m having a bad dream.

1270
02:06:57,042 --> 02:06:59,042
Get up. We’ve come to arrest you.

1271
02:06:59,333 --> 02:07:00,625
Arrest? For what?

1272
02:07:09,042 --> 02:07:09,708
Murder?

1273
02:07:10,250 --> 02:07:12,583
Murder… Something like murder.

1274
02:07:12,917 --> 02:07:14,458
Pretty much murder.

1275
02:07:14,958 --> 02:07:16,625
There was this guy called Pandi.

1276
02:07:18,333 --> 02:07:19,083
Real big shot.

1277
02:07:19,292 --> 02:07:21,042
Not anyone could have laid a finger on him.

1278
02:07:21,583 --> 02:07:23,500
One day I just went and casually stabbed him.

1279
02:07:30,708 --> 02:07:32,042
Don’t hit me, sir.

1280
02:07:32,625 --> 02:07:34,083
This is how you run a business.

1281
02:07:36,917 --> 02:07:38,917
I can’t take this anymore.

1282
02:07:39,292 --> 02:07:40,417
I am going to the police.

1283
02:07:40,500 --> 02:07:42,250
Listen to me, madam. It’s unnecessary trouble.

1284
02:07:42,333 --> 02:07:44,458
I don’t care. I want to meet the sub-inspector.

1285
02:07:44,583 --> 02:07:45,333
What’s the problem?

1286
02:07:45,417 --> 02:07:46,833
It’s just a petty case.

1287
02:07:46,958 --> 02:07:48,750
Sir, I want to file a complaint against Maari.

1288
02:07:48,917 --> 02:07:50,917
Nuisance case. File the complaint.

1289
02:07:51,167 --> 02:07:52,750
I’m ready to testify anywhere.

1290
02:07:53,250 --> 02:07:54,375
I appreciate your bravery.

1291
02:07:54,667 --> 02:07:56,458
But if I charge him with this case…

1292
02:07:56,667 --> 02:07:57,917
…he’d get out very easily.

1293
02:07:58,083 --> 02:08:00,417
Then he’d only cause more trouble for you and me.

1294
02:08:01,125 --> 02:08:02,792
We need to catch him in a bigger case.

1295
02:08:03,292 --> 02:08:05,083
I’ll be glad to help however I can.

1296
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:10,042
After a lot of searching, I’ve found the file of a closed case.

1297
02:08:11,042 --> 02:08:13,375
The murder attempt of a man named Pandi.

1298
02:08:13,917 --> 02:08:16,917
The suspect’s description and age fits Maari’s.

1299
02:08:17,583 --> 02:08:18,750
But that’s not enough.

1300
02:08:19,417 --> 02:08:22,042
We need stronger evidence connecting Maari to the case.

1301
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:23,875
What can I do for this?

1302
02:08:25,958 --> 02:08:26,958
What would you do?

1303
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:29,125
I’ll help you raise your pigeons.

1304
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,208
Calling him brother doesn’t come naturally to me.

1305
02:08:42,708 --> 02:08:43,708
What happened?

1306
02:08:49,750 --> 02:08:50,625
Maari, careful!

1307
02:08:51,792 --> 02:08:53,542
Just hungover from last night’s booze.

1308
02:08:54,125 --> 02:08:54,708
Get that.

1309
02:08:55,958 --> 02:08:59,292
Showing me a cop movie, first thing in the morning.

1310
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:03,625
Good job, man. Good job.

1311
02:09:11,083 --> 02:09:12,750
I’ve done a lot of hooliganism.

1312
02:09:13,250 --> 02:09:14,125
Rowdyism.

1313
02:09:14,667 --> 02:09:15,667
Broken a few bones.

1314
02:09:15,917 --> 02:09:18,333
I’ve done everything but nothing happened.

1315
02:09:18,542 --> 02:09:19,833
For the first time ever…

1316
02:09:20,833 --> 02:09:21,833
…I fell in love.

1317
02:09:21,958 --> 02:09:23,542
And they’re going to lock me up.

1318
02:09:24,042 --> 02:09:25,083
That is the fate.

1319
02:09:25,958 --> 02:09:26,792
“Fall in love, Maari”.

1320
02:09:27,042 --> 02:09:27,792
“Fall in love, Maari”.

1321
02:09:28,042 --> 02:09:28,875
“Fall in love, Maari”.

1322
02:09:29,917 --> 02:09:30,917
Screwed us, right?

1323
02:09:31,458 --> 02:09:33,708
What are you looking at? Come, take me away.

1324
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:37,583
He suggested it but the girl has accepted it.

1325
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:40,417
Everyone seems to have developed, just not us.

1326
02:09:43,667 --> 02:09:44,458
Is it okay?

1327
02:09:45,042 --> 02:09:46,833
A little to the left.

1328
02:09:47,667 --> 02:09:48,250
Yeah, perfect.

1329
02:09:52,875 --> 02:09:54,917
Why are they bursting crackers?Is it a festival day?

1330
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:58,708
Not a festival, Maari.The news of your arrest has spread.

1331
02:09:59,375 --> 02:10:02,042
They don’t even burst crackers for holidays.

1332
02:10:02,375 --> 02:10:04,917
But look at them celebrating my arrest!

1333
02:10:06,375 --> 02:10:07,500
They’ve torn it already?

1334
02:10:09,667 --> 02:10:13,500
You guys don’t stay here, go away.They’ll keep prodding you.

1335
02:10:13,667 --> 02:10:16,667
If a girl comes and says she loves you, just chase her away.

1336
02:10:16,958 --> 02:10:18,958
We don’t have anyone but you, Maari.

1337
02:10:19,167 --> 02:10:21,000
No one in the area will respect us now.

1338
02:10:21,333 --> 02:10:22,125
Tell him!

1339
02:10:22,250 --> 02:10:23,750
Who do we have but you?

1340
02:10:24,708 --> 02:10:26,917
Didn’t work out. Don’t overact.

1341
02:10:27,292 --> 02:10:28,792
Your brother in law lives in Madurai, right?

1342
02:10:29,125 --> 02:10:30,333
Go live with him.

1343
02:10:40,083 --> 02:10:41,250
You’ve won.

1344
02:10:41,667 --> 02:10:43,542
You used a woman, but you still won.

1345
02:10:43,958 --> 02:10:46,708
When you waltzed into my area without permission,I should have kept you under check.

1346
02:10:46,750 --> 02:10:48,042
Letting you go was my bad.

1347
02:10:48,542 --> 02:10:51,042
Where’s that girl? She must be feasting her eyes.

1348
02:10:55,083 --> 02:10:58,333
What an actor you are!

1349
02:10:59,250 --> 02:11:01,917
With all that talking and smiling, you’ve finished me, right?

1350
02:11:02,833 --> 02:11:04,583
She’s ripped me apart, right?

1351
02:11:04,917 --> 02:11:06,500
Done very beautifully!

1352
02:11:08,333 --> 02:11:09,417
Get into the vehicle.

1353
02:11:10,417 --> 02:11:12,125
Won’t be nice if we force you in.

1354
02:11:12,250 --> 02:11:14,250
Oh, my dialogue from the other day?

1355
02:11:14,333 --> 02:11:16,667
Good! It was a good counter, let’s go.

1356
02:11:21,667 --> 02:11:23,875
Bless you all.

1357
02:11:58,292 --> 02:11:59,583
Here comes Maari! Let's go.

1358
02:12:05,417 --> 02:12:06,583
How are you?

1359
02:12:06,833 --> 02:12:08,250
How are you, anna?

1360
02:12:09,792 --> 02:12:11,125
Thought you'd have lost weight…

1361
02:12:11,292 --> 02:12:12,792
But you're all plump!

1362
02:12:13,333 --> 02:12:14,417
Come on, Maari.- What?

1363
02:12:15,417 --> 02:12:16,917
You've lost so much weight.

1364
02:12:17,208 --> 02:12:18,500
When have I ever been fat?

1365
02:12:19,625 --> 02:12:20,833
One tea, brother!

1366
02:12:21,333 --> 02:12:23,000
So, what's up, Oldie?

1367
02:12:24,042 --> 02:12:25,958
With me gone, everyone in the areamust have been at peace?

1368
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:29,625
No, Maari. The situation in the area…

1369
02:12:30,375 --> 02:12:31,792
…has become very bad.

1370
02:12:32,750 --> 02:12:33,583
What happened?

1371
02:12:33,708 --> 02:12:35,167
They've arrested Velu annanand kept him under remand.

1372
02:12:35,625 --> 02:12:36,292
What?!

1373
02:12:36,625 --> 02:12:39,250
You said it wasn't safe for us to be herewhen you're in jail.

1374
02:12:39,458 --> 02:12:40,875
We went out of town for a little while.

1375
02:12:41,083 --> 02:12:43,125
When we returned, the area was unrecognisable.

1376
02:12:43,333 --> 02:12:45,917
That cop didn't just target us for no reason;

1377
02:12:46,083 --> 02:12:47,167
He had his own agenda.

1378
02:12:47,542 --> 02:12:48,792
Anna! -You idiot!

1379
02:12:49,125 --> 02:12:51,042
They've arrested Maariand you're just telling me!

1380
02:12:51,458 --> 02:12:53,208
What the hell were you doing,letting them arrest him?

1381
02:12:53,458 --> 02:12:54,333
Start the vehicle.

1382
02:12:54,625 --> 02:12:55,667
I want him released today!

1383
02:13:03,375 --> 02:13:05,833
We've got information thatyou're smuggling red sanders.

1384
02:13:06,708 --> 02:13:09,375
The Revenue Department is here with a search warrant

1385
02:13:09,458 --> 02:13:11,042
Do you know whose place this is?

1386
02:13:11,167 --> 02:13:12,375
Fool, there are cameras.

1387
02:13:13,875 --> 02:13:15,833
How did the media get hereeven before searching?

1388
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:18,333
I don't know, sir.

1389
02:13:19,208 --> 02:13:21,125
Someone must have leaked information.

1390
02:13:21,292 --> 02:13:22,833
Sir, start the search.

1391
02:13:29,083 --> 02:13:33,500
Seeing Velu anna's arrest on camera,his allies, the politicians backed out.

1392
02:13:34,083 --> 02:13:35,625
There was no one to bail him out.

1393
02:13:35,708 --> 02:13:36,500
Start the vehicle.

1394
02:13:37,583 --> 02:13:41,208
Arjun has a solid reputation at the Departmentfor busting rowdyism in the area.

1395
02:13:41,917 --> 02:13:45,667
Everyone in the area was very happy!They celebrated that fellow- Arjun.

1396
02:13:46,208 --> 02:13:47,792
He came to our area one night.

1397
02:13:48,833 --> 02:13:49,917
He entered with a plan.

1398
02:13:50,292 --> 02:13:53,500
You might've heard about the red sanderssmuggling arrest from last week.

1399
02:13:53,958 --> 02:13:58,750
The Forest Department has decided toexport the wood legally.

1400
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:00,917
This job requires immediate labour.

1401
02:14:01,375 --> 02:14:03,833
Thought this would be a good opportunityfor the unemployed in the area.

1402
02:14:04,583 --> 02:14:06,250
If you're interested, you may sign upfor the job.

1403
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:09,208
Officer Arjun has come up with this.We can trust him;

1404
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:10,500
Let's sign up.

1405
02:14:10,667 --> 02:14:13,458
You've received an invitation toget a job! Go sign up.

1406
02:14:13,833 --> 02:14:15,417
Sekar, you should sign up.

1407
02:14:15,542 --> 02:14:17,000
Come, you should sign up, too!

1408
02:14:17,375 --> 02:14:18,083
No way!

1409
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:20,542
This won't suit me at all.

1410
02:14:34,042 --> 02:14:36,875
Both red sanders and ordinary wooden logsare stacked here.

1411
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:41,542
One load of each needs to be loadedin the lorries.

1412
02:14:41,875 --> 02:14:42,500
That's the job.

1413
02:14:53,750 --> 02:14:56,542
The people asked no questionsand continued to work this way.

1414
02:14:57,375 --> 02:15:00,083
This went on for two days.

1415
02:15:00,625 --> 02:15:04,083
One day, Arjun didn't turn up at the yard.

1416
02:15:05,292 --> 02:15:06,833
There was a raid that night.

1417
02:15:14,542 --> 02:15:16,042
Seize the goods and confiscate it.

1418
02:15:16,417 --> 02:15:18,542
Stop the labourers. No one shall escape.

1419
02:15:18,667 --> 02:15:20,542
Sir, this is for the government.

1420
02:15:20,625 --> 02:15:23,625
Sure, a government job taking placeall hushed up in a closed mill?

1421
02:15:23,875 --> 02:15:25,250
Sir, something is wrong.

1422
02:15:25,458 --> 02:15:27,958
You may call Officer Arjun.He's the one who got us these jobs.

1423
02:15:28,083 --> 02:15:30,250
We went straight to him after finding this place.

1424
02:15:30,458 --> 02:15:31,750
He asked us to make the arrests.

1425
02:15:31,875 --> 02:15:32,833
Just get in the jeep!

1426
02:15:33,625 --> 02:15:34,625
Smuggling wood, are we?

1427
02:15:40,167 --> 02:15:41,542
Why is he running like this?

1428
02:15:41,625 --> 02:15:42,625
Why are you running?

1429
02:15:42,833 --> 02:15:45,083
The people who had signed up fortransporting the wood….

1430
02:15:45,292 --> 02:15:47,292
…They've been arrested and taken in.

1431
02:15:48,667 --> 02:15:49,208
What?

1432
02:15:49,375 --> 02:15:50,917
Officer Arjun had taken them for the job.

1433
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,042
Did you tell him about it?

1434
02:15:52,125 --> 02:15:55,042
I went to the station;They said he has taken two days off.

1435
02:15:55,375 --> 02:15:58,958
The next day, strange things began to happen.

1436
02:16:01,375 --> 02:16:02,708
Listen up, everybody!

1437
02:16:02,833 --> 02:16:05,500
All the shops in the marketplaceare under Ravi annan's control now.

1438
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,250
You had better pay up on time,If you want to your shops to remain.

1439
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,167
Even Maari is gone now;Who are you to collect from us?

1440
02:16:13,375 --> 02:16:13,958
Exactly!

1441
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,833
Want to see what would happen ifOfficer Arjun finds out?

1442
02:16:32,958 --> 02:16:33,917
You were right!

1443
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,958
I had to see what would happenif Arjun finds out.

1444
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,125
Anyone else has something to say?

1445
02:16:41,792 --> 02:16:44,750
I shall never hear Maari's name again.

1446
02:16:45,458 --> 02:16:47,250
Whatever I say will be the law.

1447
02:16:47,625 --> 02:16:49,167
That's when we found out…

1448
02:16:49,292 --> 02:16:52,083
This cop and "Bird" Ravi were in ittogether the whole time!

1449
02:16:52,375 --> 02:16:54,792
Sir, we sent our men to workonly because of your word.

1450
02:16:54,833 --> 02:16:56,542
Now they're saying something about smuggling!

1451
02:16:56,708 --> 02:16:57,250
Yes.

1452
02:16:57,667 --> 02:16:59,042
I did take them for a smuggling job.

1453
02:16:59,583 --> 02:17:01,500
Ravi and I did all this together.

1454
02:17:02,542 --> 02:17:03,542
If I'd told you that…

1455
02:17:03,958 --> 02:17:05,167
You wouldn't have come to work.

1456
02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:07,542
We were just trying it for the first time;There was a small goof up.

1457
02:17:07,917 --> 02:17:09,458
And there was a raid, too!

1458
02:17:09,750 --> 02:17:11,875
Sir, testify that they didn'tknow what the job was;

1459
02:17:12,125 --> 02:17:13,250
And get them released, sir.

1460
02:17:13,958 --> 02:17:15,917
Are you stupid?Then I'll get caught.

1461
02:17:16,125 --> 02:17:16,958
No way. Just leave.

1462
02:17:17,125 --> 02:17:19,708
Sir, I helped you becauseI thought you were a good guy.

1463
02:17:20,208 --> 02:17:22,542
How could you listen to themand do such terrible things?

1464
02:17:23,292 --> 02:17:24,375
Listen to them?

1465
02:17:24,667 --> 02:17:26,625
This was all my idea.

1466
02:17:27,042 --> 02:17:28,958
Do you know why we snatched Maari and Velu?

1467
02:17:29,208 --> 02:17:30,792
To take their places.

1468
02:17:32,083 --> 02:17:35,500
This is why I re-opened Maari's old case.

1469
02:17:37,167 --> 02:17:39,750
You stopped being of use after Maari's arrest.

1470
02:17:40,375 --> 02:17:42,208
Don't ask unnecessary questions.Mind your business.

1471
02:17:42,417 --> 02:17:42,750
No.

1472
02:17:43,125 --> 02:17:45,250
I won't let this go.- What will you do, woman?

1473
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:46,667
What will you do?

1474
02:17:46,750 --> 02:17:48,458
Sir, this is wrong.

1475
02:17:48,833 --> 02:17:50,250
Arumugam, chase them away.

1476
02:17:51,583 --> 02:17:52,583
What are you staring at?

1477
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,083
Poor people.Let's get them out somehow!

1478
02:17:55,250 --> 02:17:57,042
Listen, just do as I say.

1479
02:17:57,625 --> 02:17:58,458
Everybody, leave.

1480
02:17:59,583 --> 02:18:04,333
Their plan was to move you and Velu annanout of the picture to smuggle red sanders.

1481
02:18:19,042 --> 02:18:22,833
"Bird" Ravi's controls Pigeon race and tournaments.

1482
02:18:23,542 --> 02:18:25,875
There is no ethics. It's terrible.

1483
02:18:26,250 --> 02:18:28,333
They just do everything to their convenience.

1484
02:18:28,583 --> 02:18:31,542
Most of the pro fanciers have stopped racing.

1485
02:18:37,542 --> 02:18:38,167
Let's go.

1486
02:18:43,417 --> 02:18:46,583
I got word from Velu annan after your release;

1487
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:50,625
He said to leave the area;That it will be better to vacate.

1488
02:18:54,458 --> 02:18:54,917
Let's leave.

1489
02:18:55,417 --> 02:18:56,667
You're just going to leave?

1490
02:18:56,958 --> 02:18:57,875
What else can we do?

1491
02:18:58,542 --> 02:19:02,250
Velu annan has said so himself.Who do we stay back for?

1492
02:19:02,750 --> 02:19:04,250
Bring the pigeons and everything.

1493
02:19:05,250 --> 02:19:05,833
Let’s leave.

1494
02:19:06,875 --> 02:19:08,750
Punching Bag, you heard him.

1495
02:19:09,583 --> 02:19:12,583
Pack our stuff and bring it out;We'll get a moving vehicle.

1496
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:17,042
Why are they loading things?

1497
02:19:17,167 --> 02:19:17,917
I don't know!

1498
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,333
You useless, bring it carefully.

1499
02:19:21,583 --> 02:19:22,833
When did you get here?

1500
02:19:24,042 --> 02:19:25,167
Has Maari been released?

1501
02:19:25,625 --> 02:19:26,625
Is he here, too?

1502
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,917
Can't you tell?We're just leaving.

1503
02:19:30,667 --> 02:19:32,875
He'll never come by here.You can be happy.

1504
02:19:34,542 --> 02:19:36,542
It's so hard to leave our birthplace!

1505
02:19:36,625 --> 02:19:38,542
Look, it's hard for us, too.

1506
02:19:38,917 --> 02:19:41,208
You deserve it!You played the fiddle to that cop.

1507
02:19:41,833 --> 02:19:43,250
We'll do our jobs elsewhere.

1508
02:19:43,667 --> 02:19:45,375
Your shops will rot, wait and see.

1509
02:19:47,542 --> 02:19:49,917
Look who else is here!Let’s quickly leave.

1510
02:19:52,042 --> 02:19:54,792
Look there! They've decided to pack and disappear.

1511
02:19:54,917 --> 02:19:57,625
Punching Bag, isn't your annan Maari here?

1512
02:19:57,833 --> 02:20:00,375
How could he ever face anyone in the area?

1513
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:02,667
Look, you stabbed him in the dark.Don't be so proud of yourselves.

1514
02:20:03,167 --> 02:20:05,500
You're not fit to compete with annan.

1515
02:20:05,792 --> 02:20:08,167
What? What qualification do we need?

1516
02:20:08,292 --> 02:20:09,417
Don't do it!

1517
02:20:10,167 --> 02:20:12,583
Go ahead and do it.He can take a beating.

1518
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:16,500
Maari hits you everyday.Let us hit you today.

1519
02:20:17,417 --> 02:20:18,250
Hit him!

1520
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:21,792
I will hit you and you will take it./He was leaving anyway.

1521
02:20:22,917 --> 02:20:23,958
Hey, let him go!

1522
02:21:09,375 --> 02:21:09,708
Come.

1523
02:21:10,917 --> 02:21:12,167
You will go to him?

1524
02:22:01,917 --> 02:22:02,583
Maari!

1525
02:22:05,542 --> 02:22:07,167
Don't do it, Maari! Don't!

1526
02:22:17,375 --> 02:22:20,417
Hey, dummy! Looks like your face is poached.

1527
02:22:20,542 --> 02:22:22,417
Cheekiness is bad.

1528
02:23:48,458 --> 02:23:48,875
Run.

1529
02:23:49,792 --> 02:23:51,042
Run and tell that cop.

1530
02:23:52,583 --> 02:23:53,750
I’m here to stay.

1531
02:23:54,542 --> 02:23:56,250
He may have the area under his control.

1532
02:23:56,583 --> 02:23:58,583
But Maari is always out of control.

1533
02:24:02,875 --> 02:24:04,625
Only I get to beat him up.

1534
02:24:05,625 --> 02:24:08,083
Think you get to show off in my area?

1535
02:24:10,583 --> 02:24:11,750
I'll finish you off!

1536
02:24:40,542 --> 02:24:42,000
Stop! What are you doing here?

1537
02:24:42,250 --> 02:24:44,458
Maari doesn't want to see your faces.

1538
02:24:44,667 --> 02:24:46,458
Go away.- Get out of my way!

1539
02:24:46,542 --> 02:24:48,833
We want to talk to our man Maari.- Your man Maari?!

1540
02:24:49,042 --> 02:24:52,042
Maari, things got really rough in your absence.

1541
02:24:52,250 --> 02:24:55,250
That cop tricked us and got us in trouble.

1542
02:24:55,417 --> 02:24:57,875
Not just that, he's hiked the bribe threefold.

1543
02:24:58,042 --> 02:24:59,833
None of us can live!- Drop dead, then.

1544
02:24:59,875 --> 02:25:02,333
Yes, Maari.We were really scared and helpless.

1545
02:25:02,458 --> 02:25:04,542
We'll be brave now that you're here.

1546
02:25:07,250 --> 02:25:08,083
You men…

1547
02:25:08,792 --> 02:25:12,250
You're the ones who burst crackers andcelebrated my arrest!

1548
02:25:12,417 --> 02:25:14,417
This wash-basin face was theone who fired a flower-pot.

1549
02:25:16,167 --> 02:25:18,917
You people chose to be allied to that cop.

1550
02:25:19,417 --> 02:25:20,000
Suffer, now.

1551
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,542
Go away!

1552
02:25:23,708 --> 02:25:25,583
You heard the man. Leave.

1553
02:25:25,875 --> 02:25:27,917
Cart yourself away!

1554
02:25:40,875 --> 02:25:41,875
Are you stupid?

1555
02:25:42,458 --> 02:25:43,875
He would have left on his own.

1556
02:25:45,042 --> 02:25:47,458
Now you picked a fight with him andmade him stay back.

1557
02:25:48,542 --> 02:25:50,417
What could he do here, anyway?

1558
02:25:51,708 --> 02:25:55,042
We shall corner him at the right time and place.

1559
02:25:57,750 --> 02:26:00,000
Check if all the pigeons are in the right condition.

1560
02:26:00,542 --> 02:26:02,792
I'll come and checkon the young birds in the morning.

1561
02:26:03,250 --> 02:26:06,000
We'll start the training tomorrow morning.Or it will be too late.

1562
02:26:07,708 --> 02:26:08,250
What?

1563
02:26:08,625 --> 02:26:11,625
How dare you come here?-I only came to apologise.

1564
02:26:12,958 --> 02:26:13,583
I'm sorry.

1565
02:26:14,750 --> 02:26:17,625
I know you must be very angry with me.

1566
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:19,083
But...

1567
02:26:19,875 --> 02:26:21,250
I did have my reasons.

1568
02:26:22,208 --> 02:26:24,042
I thought I was doing the right thing.

1569
02:26:24,375 --> 02:26:28,417
I didn't realise I was helping the bad guy.

1570
02:26:29,125 --> 02:26:34,583
Anyhow, it's wrong to betray someone's trust.

1571
02:26:35,292 --> 02:26:36,958
So, I'm really sorry.

1572
02:26:39,542 --> 02:26:41,500
I've come all the way to apologise!

1573
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,333
Won't you at least respond to me?

1574
02:26:48,167 --> 02:26:49,667
I forgive you. Leave.

1575
02:26:56,792 --> 02:26:58,917
Go, Powdered-Face.

1576
02:26:59,708 --> 02:27:01,542
Maari asked you to leave!

1577
02:27:07,875 --> 02:27:09,417
Do you know Maari committed that murder?

1578
02:27:09,542 --> 02:27:11,542
Because they killed his loved pigeon.

1579
02:27:12,250 --> 02:27:13,792
Tell me honestly, if you'd been in his place…

1580
02:27:13,958 --> 02:27:16,458
Wouldn't you be furious?Wouldn't you have finished them off?

1581
02:27:17,375 --> 02:27:19,875
Why do you trouble the area people?

1582
02:27:20,583 --> 02:27:23,583
Why can't you show the affection on peoplethat you bestow upon pigeons?

1583
02:27:23,750 --> 02:27:25,958
Why should we?To these people?

1584
02:27:26,583 --> 02:27:27,917
Did they do that for Maari?

1585
02:27:29,292 --> 02:27:31,375
Who helped him when he was a kid?

1586
02:27:32,083 --> 02:27:34,208
When he was alone and hungry?

1587
02:27:35,208 --> 02:27:36,167
Not one person came.

1588
02:27:36,542 --> 02:27:39,542
He only had one thing then: His pigeons.

1589
02:27:39,875 --> 02:27:42,500
It was the pigeons that fed him.

1590
02:27:42,833 --> 02:27:47,542
Maari always says, you can trust a pigeonbut not a human.

1591
02:27:47,917 --> 02:27:49,500
Now you've proved him right.

1592
02:27:49,667 --> 02:27:52,583
What I did seemed right that day…

1593
02:27:52,667 --> 02:27:54,208
Don't you talk about right and wrong!

1594
02:27:54,458 --> 02:27:57,417
Have you ever struggled in life?Have you ever struggled for a daily meal?

1595
02:27:57,625 --> 02:28:00,375
If you just waltz in here and apologise,think he'll grin and accept?

1596
02:28:00,708 --> 02:28:03,625
Look, he doesn't ever want to set eyeson you after what you've done.

1597
02:28:04,125 --> 02:28:07,167
If you keep coming back here,it will get rough.

1598
02:28:08,292 --> 02:28:10,292
Stop talking to that Powdered-Face!Let's leave

1599
02:28:29,167 --> 02:28:30,458
What's your problem?

1600
02:28:33,042 --> 02:28:34,458
Tell me, or buzz off!

1601
02:28:35,125 --> 02:28:39,375
A few days after you went to the jail,my school fees was due.

1602
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:41,167
But it wasn't paid at all.

1603
02:28:41,583 --> 02:28:46,375
That's when the school staff told methat you've been paying my fees.

1604
02:28:49,958 --> 02:28:50,875
I didn't pay.

1605
02:28:51,042 --> 02:28:54,000
I know you're doing it secretly.

1606
02:28:54,250 --> 02:28:56,583
I won't tell anyone that you're paying.

1607
02:28:56,667 --> 02:28:58,958
Hey, idiot! I told you I'm not.

1608
02:28:59,292 --> 02:29:00,750
What do I care if you go to school?

1609
02:29:01,125 --> 02:29:01,958
Just go away.

1610
02:29:03,542 --> 02:29:06,917
Did that cop trick you and jail you?

1611
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:14,500
Did they hit you in the jail?

1612
02:29:16,833 --> 02:29:18,583
Did you suffer?

1613
02:29:21,042 --> 02:29:21,792
Poor thing.

1614
02:29:23,667 --> 02:29:25,167
It wasn't that bad. Go, now!

1615
02:29:25,417 --> 02:29:28,208
I wasn't talking about you. I meant the cop.

1616
02:29:28,375 --> 02:29:30,375
You'll get him, one fine day!

1617
02:29:40,375 --> 02:29:42,375
Loudmouth, go to sleep.

1618
02:29:42,542 --> 02:29:43,542
Rogue!

1619
02:29:54,333 --> 02:29:55,958
We can enter our birds to the race next week.

1620
02:29:56,250 --> 02:29:57,500
All the pigeons are ready.

1621
02:29:57,875 --> 02:29:59,917
Our next target is Arjun.

1622
02:30:00,708 --> 02:30:03,208
Don't know why, but my handsfeel all jittery since morning.

1623
02:30:03,417 --> 02:30:03,875
What?

1624
02:30:04,458 --> 02:30:06,792
Need to do something about this Arjunand "Bird Ravi"- Urgently!

1625
02:30:07,542 --> 02:30:08,542
He's a cop.

1626
02:30:08,792 --> 02:30:11,417
You can't do him on urgent basis.Must keep calm.

1627
02:30:14,458 --> 02:30:16,875
I'm idle nowadays.Feeling a little lazy.

1628
02:30:17,542 --> 02:30:19,875
I'm so bored; I want to…

1629
02:30:20,917 --> 02:30:21,750
…get a job.

1630
02:30:23,167 --> 02:30:24,083
A job?

1631
02:30:24,750 --> 02:30:27,958
Oh Jesus! Save this Child…

1632
02:30:28,292 --> 02:30:29,125
What?

1633
02:30:30,250 --> 02:30:32,167
Did you have a job before all this?

1634
02:30:32,292 --> 02:30:33,625
Of course, man!

1635
02:30:33,708 --> 02:30:35,500
We were breaking a few bones,causing trouble!

1636
02:30:35,542 --> 02:30:37,917
Collecting racketeering money amdWe even raced pigeons.

1637
02:30:38,125 --> 02:30:39,250
Is that a job, anna?

1638
02:30:39,625 --> 02:30:42,625
You've been acting cocky ever since I returnedfrom the jail…

1639
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:44,917
Not for me.What job can you do?

1640
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:46,083
I'll do any job!

1641
02:30:46,250 --> 02:30:47,833
What job?- Any job!

1642
02:30:48,167 --> 02:30:50,375
So we'll get you a painting job with Murugan?

1643
02:30:51,083 --> 02:30:54,625
But painting is an artist's job.I can't do that!

1644
02:30:54,875 --> 02:30:58,875
You paint the place red when you hit people.- But that’s not the same, idiot!

1645
02:30:59,167 --> 02:31:02,417
There's a mechanic in our area- Mani.You can chase him out and do his job.

1646
02:31:02,583 --> 02:31:03,833
Chasing out part, I can do...

1647
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,333
But I don't know about unscrewing, screwing and all that.

1648
02:31:07,458 --> 02:31:08,458
You said you'll do any job!

1649
02:31:08,583 --> 02:31:10,750
You're only naming jobs that I can't do.

1650
02:31:11,958 --> 02:31:13,000
Remember Rani akka?

1651
02:31:13,125 --> 02:31:15,167
We seized an auto from her husbandwhen he failed to pay up.

1652
02:31:15,375 --> 02:31:16,458
That auto is still with us.

1653
02:31:17,542 --> 02:31:18,542
That's correct!

1654
02:31:18,792 --> 02:31:21,167
We'll dismantle and sell the parts?-No!

1655
02:31:21,917 --> 02:31:22,875
We'll drive the auto!

1656
02:31:22,958 --> 02:31:25,000
Just talking about it won't do!You need to know how to ride one.

1657
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:28,500
Come here.

1658
02:31:28,917 --> 02:31:31,000
You don't even respond to me normally…- Come here. Sit.

1659
02:31:32,375 --> 02:31:33,500
Tell me-Sit down!

1660
02:31:34,292 --> 02:31:37,208
What's the matter?- The auto…

1661
02:31:37,375 --> 02:31:38,750
You're mocking me?

1662
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,958
Auto... you can drive.

1663
02:31:41,500 --> 02:31:42,250
Say something.

1664
02:31:42,375 --> 02:31:43,625
Shall we?- You can drive.

1665
02:31:43,667 --> 02:31:44,667
You can drive, brother.

1666
02:31:44,958 --> 02:31:46,833
Then we’ll start driving an auto from tomorrow.

1667
02:32:11,250 --> 02:32:11,792
Superb!

1668
02:32:12,125 --> 02:32:13,125
You carry on.-Be careful, anna!

1669
02:32:13,292 --> 02:32:14,750
I said get in, man.- It's an inauspicious time…

1670
02:32:14,917 --> 02:32:16,333
Get in.

1671
02:32:16,750 --> 02:32:17,750
Do as Maari says.

1672
02:32:19,208 --> 02:32:20,333
You come with us, anna.

1673
02:32:20,500 --> 02:32:21,917
Hope nothing happens!

1674
02:32:23,792 --> 02:32:25,000
This is strange!

1675
02:32:35,708 --> 02:32:37,250
Want to take the auto?

1676
02:32:37,375 --> 02:32:37,833
No, anna.

1677
02:32:37,917 --> 02:32:39,500
Where are you headed?- Saidapet.

1678
02:32:39,583 --> 02:32:41,000
Won't take the auto to Saidapet?

1679
02:32:41,167 --> 02:32:42,167
I take the bus.

1680
02:32:42,333 --> 02:32:43,333
Just get in.- No, anna…

1681
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:45,125
Get in, boy.- No, anna…

1682
02:32:48,833 --> 02:32:49,667
Please.

1683
02:32:50,625 --> 02:32:51,625
Anna, please…

1684
02:33:01,708 --> 02:33:02,458
Stop it!

1685
02:33:04,417 --> 02:33:05,417
Give us the amount.

1686
02:33:06,792 --> 02:33:07,917
How much, anna?- Just give me that!

1687
02:33:08,042 --> 02:33:09,042
Here- Anna!

1688
02:33:10,125 --> 02:33:11,458
Please, give me a tip, anna!

1689
02:33:11,583 --> 02:33:12,542
Give you… a tip?

1690
02:33:14,417 --> 02:33:15,375
Pick that up and go.

1691
02:33:15,583 --> 02:33:16,417
Stop!

1692
02:33:16,958 --> 02:33:18,917
Grab that guy… Come here!

1693
02:33:19,458 --> 02:33:21,625
Get in... go sit inside.

1694
02:33:22,583 --> 02:33:24,375
Auto, huh?- Of course it’s an auto.

1695
02:33:25,417 --> 02:33:26,167
Get in.

1696
02:33:26,292 --> 02:33:27,875
Sir, I've come on my bike.

1697
02:33:28,875 --> 02:33:30,958
I said get in.

1698
02:33:32,917 --> 02:33:35,917
Tiny guy… you talk too much!

1699
02:33:36,125 --> 02:33:38,417
Squeeze in! Push in!

1700
02:33:39,333 --> 02:33:42,583
He wants to ride in some other auto!- What are you doing?

1701
02:33:43,625 --> 02:33:46,167
Just come, man.Else we’d be in trouble with Maari.

1702
02:33:46,875 --> 02:33:48,667
Keep going, don't stop!

1703
02:33:53,125 --> 02:33:56,792
Maari, they're refusing to accept our entry.Have a word with them.

1704
02:33:58,750 --> 02:34:01,917
The entry time is up, Maari.They've said not to accept any more entries.

1705
02:34:02,542 --> 02:34:05,542
That's not a big deal at all.Call Muthu anna. We'll talk to him.

1706
02:34:05,750 --> 02:34:07,125
He's not the current president.

1707
02:34:07,708 --> 02:34:10,458
If you want to register after the last date, talk to the new president.

1708
02:34:10,875 --> 02:34:13,167
Here he comes. Talk to him.

1709
02:34:13,542 --> 02:34:15,458
It's this guy? I knew it.

1710
02:34:18,708 --> 02:34:19,708
Hello, Maari.

1711
02:34:20,125 --> 02:34:22,167
You've come to register?The last date is over.

1712
02:34:23,125 --> 02:34:24,125
You should have come sooner.

1713
02:34:24,250 --> 02:34:26,708
Oh, I'm sorry! You were in the jail, right?

1714
02:34:27,875 --> 02:34:30,000
What do we do, anna?- I don't know, sir.

1715
02:34:30,625 --> 02:34:33,625
I said there's a chance if they request you.

1716
02:34:33,917 --> 02:34:34,792
That's true.

1717
02:34:35,417 --> 02:34:36,583
Ask them to request, then.

1718
02:34:36,708 --> 02:34:38,625
Request to your dirty face?

1719
02:34:39,417 --> 02:34:40,458
Maari, we'll see next year.

1720
02:34:40,625 --> 02:34:43,917
Saturday, don't play up.- I'm saying it openly.

1721
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,583
It's our turn in this area now.

1722
02:34:49,167 --> 02:34:51,500
Are you flying your birds this year, "Bird" Ravi?

1723
02:34:51,750 --> 02:34:52,417
Yes.

1724
02:34:54,042 --> 02:34:55,042
Okay, that's nice.

1725
02:34:55,542 --> 02:34:56,542
You should do that.

1726
02:34:57,417 --> 02:34:58,542
What are you grinning for?

1727
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,750
That's nothing. Forget about it.

1728
02:35:00,958 --> 02:35:03,000
I asked you why you were grinning!

1729
02:35:04,625 --> 02:35:05,625
Look at that board.

1730
02:35:08,667 --> 02:35:13,250
You must wish to see your name there, sometime.You go ahead and fly your birds.

1731
02:35:13,708 --> 02:35:15,875
You think we can’t compete with your birds?

1732
02:35:16,792 --> 02:35:19,417
The whole world knows that.Raising your voice won't change it.

1733
02:35:20,500 --> 02:35:22,500
We'll let you win this time.

1734
02:35:24,583 --> 02:35:25,458
Take his entry.

1735
02:35:26,250 --> 02:35:27,792
We'll see who wins.

1736
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,208
No, I'll let you have it this time.

1737
02:35:30,250 --> 02:35:31,292
You let your birds race!

1738
02:35:31,917 --> 02:35:32,917
Come here!

1739
02:35:35,917 --> 02:35:37,917
Why is he such a moron?- Yeah!

1740
02:35:38,167 --> 02:35:40,000
You heard the Prez. Take our entry!

1741
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,667
We prevented him from participatingso that you could win.

1742
02:35:48,208 --> 02:35:51,792
He knew you would fall for itif he teased you.

1743
02:35:51,875 --> 02:35:54,208
And you fell for it!-Let it be.

1744
02:35:54,792 --> 02:35:56,917
His pigeons are three months behind ours in training.

1745
02:35:57,250 --> 02:35:59,750
He doesn't have any money to feed themspecial food and medicines.

1746
02:36:00,708 --> 02:36:03,708
We've readied our pigeonswith imported medicines and tonics.

1747
02:36:04,042 --> 02:36:07,167
We've been training them for four months!This year is ours.

1748
02:36:07,333 --> 02:36:09,500
You've been doing all this for years now.

1749
02:36:10,667 --> 02:36:12,167
Why have you never won?

1750
02:36:14,250 --> 02:36:16,875
You can't win unless you admit theopponent's strengths.

1751
02:36:17,292 --> 02:36:21,125
Even if he starts training them late,even if he trains them with just water;

1752
02:36:21,375 --> 02:36:22,375
His pigeons will win.

1753
02:36:22,667 --> 02:36:23,417
That's Maari.

1754
02:36:24,042 --> 02:36:26,167
That's why I told you not to let him enter.

1755
02:36:27,917 --> 02:36:29,333
What do you even know about pigeons?

1756
02:36:30,625 --> 02:36:31,583
Wait and watch.

1757
02:36:32,208 --> 02:36:36,167
As the race day draws closer,you'll get nervous and ask me for help.

1758
02:36:37,042 --> 02:36:37,917
It will happen.

1759
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:45,083
Don't stare at the pigeon after feeding it.He can't digest his food.

1760
02:36:46,125 --> 02:36:46,417
Anna.

1761
02:36:47,167 --> 02:36:48,375
Has the trial date been announced?

1762
02:36:48,750 --> 02:36:49,917
The pigeons are getting ready.

1763
02:36:51,500 --> 02:36:52,958
Why are you hitting him?

1764
02:36:53,750 --> 02:36:55,875
He asked me not to come.But I came anyway.

1765
02:36:56,500 --> 02:36:58,375
You do good to others secretly, right?

1766
02:36:58,958 --> 02:37:03,875
You've been paying Kavitha's school fees?

1767
02:37:04,208 --> 02:37:07,208
Who? Our Loudspeaker Kavitha?You never told us!

1768
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,958
Why do you refuse to reveal the good in you?

1769
02:37:14,125 --> 02:37:15,500
It's fine if you don't want to accept.

1770
02:37:16,333 --> 02:37:20,125
I knew there's a good guyin there, somewhere.

1771
02:37:21,625 --> 02:37:23,667
Now I've seen that.And that's enough.

1772
02:37:24,833 --> 02:37:28,292
Even if you keep chasing me away,I'll keep coming back to help.

1773
02:37:32,625 --> 02:37:34,542
You've helped me enough, already.

1774
02:37:35,125 --> 02:37:37,417
What are you trying to get from me,by fawning this way?

1775
02:37:38,375 --> 02:37:40,000
Why do you like it so much to be a bad guy?

1776
02:37:41,500 --> 02:37:44,917
I'd rather be a pure bad guythan an adulterated good guy.

1777
02:37:45,167 --> 02:37:45,708
Okay?

1778
02:37:55,667 --> 02:37:57,375
Ask the street vendors to pay up.- Okay!

1779
02:37:58,125 --> 02:37:59,625
Don't leave out anyone.

1780
02:38:01,125 --> 02:38:02,875
Pay up! Quick…

1781
02:38:03,917 --> 02:38:05,167
Pay.- Here.

1782
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:07,833
Greetings, anna.

1783
02:38:08,042 --> 02:38:09,042
Take it out.

1784
02:38:09,333 --> 02:38:10,792
What are you staring at? Go!

1785
02:38:11,417 --> 02:38:12,667
What a measly amount!

1786
02:38:15,750 --> 02:38:18,125
Have all the auto drivers paid up?- Yes, all of them…

1787
02:38:19,625 --> 02:38:20,625
Except him.

1788
02:38:27,125 --> 02:38:29,917
Since when does Maari drive an auto?Why hasn't he paid?

1789
02:38:30,167 --> 02:38:32,000
He refuses to join the union.

1790
02:38:32,167 --> 02:38:33,875
He refused and you accepted?

1791
02:38:35,333 --> 02:38:36,708
Pay up, man.

1792
02:38:39,708 --> 02:38:42,417
Pay up nicely or we'll make you.

1793
02:39:22,125 --> 02:39:22,458
Go.

1794
02:39:24,958 --> 02:39:25,625
I said, go!

1795
02:39:29,917 --> 02:39:35,167
He'll break your ribs, the King of Con;Can't toss him a bone, he's the don.

1796
02:39:36,250 --> 02:39:41,500
Now he's back- bigger and better.Our man Maari, he's a victor!

1797
02:39:43,958 --> 02:39:44,875
You'll take it?

1798
02:39:46,625 --> 02:39:48,875
Will you take it and reach home in a piece?

1799
02:39:49,125 --> 02:39:52,292
Dare to throw an angry gaze;Maari will mangle your face.

1800
02:39:52,458 --> 02:39:55,500
Wanna trot like some big gun?Consider your life done.

1801
02:39:55,667 --> 02:39:58,667
Rat on Maari like a wuss;Wait and see what Maari does.

1802
02:39:58,833 --> 02:40:02,208
He's a different kind of rowdy;- Maari;He won't talk nice, he's Maari.

1803
02:40:04,833 --> 02:40:06,792
How much?- No, it's fine.

1804
02:40:07,458 --> 02:40:08,458
Let it be, Maari.- Right.

1805
02:40:23,708 --> 02:40:24,792
Still scared of him?

1806
02:40:25,667 --> 02:40:28,208
You should have beat him up andcollected the money.

1807
02:40:28,833 --> 02:40:31,208
Easy for you to say.We're the one who got beat up.

1808
02:40:32,167 --> 02:40:32,958
It's nothing, sir.

1809
02:40:33,667 --> 02:40:35,917
Let it go. Doesn't matterif one guy doesn't pay.

1810
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:38,250
Why do you think we collect?

1811
02:40:38,875 --> 02:40:40,458
Is it a major source of income?

1812
02:40:40,750 --> 02:40:42,417
Even they're struggling to pay us.

1813
02:40:43,250 --> 02:40:46,458
We're collecting to keep them under control.

1814
02:40:47,208 --> 02:40:49,917
Even if one person refuses to pay,that fear will subside.

1815
02:40:50,667 --> 02:40:51,625
Can’t let that happen.

1816
02:40:52,125 --> 02:40:53,375
Need to fix it tomorrow!

1817
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,625
The chains were a lot heavierbefore I went to prison.

1818
02:40:58,167 --> 02:41:00,000
Now it's all light.

1819
02:41:00,208 --> 02:41:01,375
He was roaming around with them!

1820
02:41:01,458 --> 02:41:03,417
Roaming?- I had it in my house, man.

1821
02:41:04,708 --> 02:41:07,500
Maari is the most bejeweled auto driverin Tamil Nadu!

1822
02:41:08,292 --> 02:41:09,750
Anna, look who's here.

1823
02:41:14,458 --> 02:41:15,292
Really?

1824
02:41:15,708 --> 02:41:17,292
Maari drives an auto?

1825
02:41:18,042 --> 02:41:22,625
I was expecting complaints that he's doingrowdyism and causing trouble…

1826
02:41:23,500 --> 02:41:24,667
But he’s just driving an auto?

1827
02:41:25,542 --> 02:41:26,542
What is it, Maari?

1828
02:41:26,917 --> 02:41:28,833
Heard you refused to pay the fee?

1829
02:41:29,167 --> 02:41:31,625
Caught up in the past, were you?

1830
02:41:32,250 --> 02:41:33,708
You're a nobody now.

1831
02:41:34,667 --> 02:41:36,417
Get that in your head first.

1832
02:41:38,958 --> 02:41:41,750
If I'm a nobody,what drove you to come here?

1833
02:41:42,500 --> 02:41:43,500
I meant, your jeep.

1834
02:41:44,958 --> 02:41:47,750
Looks like a bit of the old Maari is leftin the auto-guy somewhere!

1835
02:41:49,875 --> 02:41:50,875
Shouldn't be.

1836
02:41:52,042 --> 02:41:53,208
Drop your cigarette.

1837
02:41:55,875 --> 02:41:56,750
Drop it!

1838
02:41:58,125 --> 02:41:59,125
Careful, Maari!

1839
02:41:59,458 --> 02:42:00,958
Sir, why are you hitting him?

1840
02:42:11,583 --> 02:42:13,792
Maari, listen.He's a cop. Let's not cause trouble.

1841
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,917
Sir, we won't cause trouble.-Trying to slither away?

1842
02:42:18,125 --> 02:42:19,458
Sir, don't hit him.

1843
02:42:20,875 --> 02:42:22,667
Please listen to us.Don't hit him.

1844
02:42:28,208 --> 02:42:29,750
Anna, ask him to stop.

1845
02:42:30,250 --> 02:42:32,417
No, sir. Don't hit him!Please listen, sir.

1846
02:42:40,667 --> 02:42:42,292
Sir, please tell them to stop.

1847
02:42:44,583 --> 02:42:45,500
Stop hitting!

1848
02:42:45,667 --> 02:42:47,417
Okay, that's enough. Stop!

1849
02:42:51,667 --> 02:42:53,875
I'm the boss here from now. Okay?

1850
02:42:54,583 --> 02:42:56,958
Either run away with your pigeons.

1851
02:42:57,500 --> 02:42:59,792
Or lie low with your tail between your legs.

1852
02:43:00,458 --> 02:43:02,625
Else, I'll come hit you whenever I'm bored.

1853
02:43:03,125 --> 02:43:05,000
You're my Punching Bag now.

1854
02:43:05,625 --> 02:43:07,250
Hey, give me a cigarette./Give him a cigarette.

1855
02:43:17,542 --> 02:43:18,417
So...

1856
02:43:19,208 --> 02:43:22,708
When a mosquito bites a sleeping man,it doesn't make it a hero.

1857
02:43:23,500 --> 02:43:27,083
One fine day, if it bites him when he's awake,one SWAT! and it's POOF!- done for.

1858
02:43:27,250 --> 02:43:28,250
One fine day...

1859
02:43:42,292 --> 02:43:45,375
He comes in his cop uniform,knowing we can't hit him then.

1860
02:43:45,917 --> 02:43:47,417
If only he dared to come without it!

1861
02:43:48,042 --> 02:43:49,375
We shouldn't keep quiet anymore, Maari.

1862
02:43:49,625 --> 02:43:52,458
Just say the word and we'll deal with himin other ways.

1863
02:43:55,500 --> 02:43:59,000
We need to get Velu annan released first.- How will that cop let that happen?

1864
02:44:03,583 --> 02:44:04,000
Listen.

1865
02:44:04,250 --> 02:44:06,500
Where are you running?Come here, little guy!

1866
02:44:07,542 --> 02:44:09,125
Maari, I don't know anything.

1867
02:44:09,458 --> 02:44:10,667
I didn't help him intentionally.

1868
02:44:10,875 --> 02:44:13,750
I thought he was a nice guy.I'm not on his side.

1869
02:44:15,042 --> 02:44:16,917
I need some information to lock him.

1870
02:44:17,792 --> 02:44:19,833
You know all about the frauds he's committed?

1871
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:21,500
Tell me.

1872
02:44:22,667 --> 02:44:24,292
I'd lose my job if he found out.

1873
02:44:24,375 --> 02:44:26,458
If you don't tell him, you'll lose your life.Is that okay?

1874
02:44:26,583 --> 02:44:27,292
Tell him!

1875
02:44:28,250 --> 02:44:30,167
I don't know his lorry routes, Maari.

1876
02:44:30,375 --> 02:44:31,375
But I do know one thing.

1877
02:44:31,708 --> 02:44:34,167
To avoid the checking that happensin all the tolls...

1878
02:44:34,458 --> 02:44:36,167
He uses travels vehicles to carry small loads.

1879
02:44:36,208 --> 02:44:37,958
I know some of these routes, Maari.

1880
02:44:47,375 --> 02:44:49,333
Looks like the customs guys.We're caught!

1881
02:44:57,375 --> 02:44:57,667
Lift it up????

1882
02:44:58,625 --> 02:44:59,667
I'll hit you!

1883
02:45:02,375 --> 02:45:03,500
Sir, we got it, sir.

1884
02:45:03,833 --> 02:45:05,292
Meaning?- We got the wood.

1885
02:45:05,333 --> 02:45:06,625
Shit!- Open the door.

1886
02:45:07,375 --> 02:45:08,417
Bloody hell.- What?

1887
02:45:08,542 --> 02:45:09,417
Hell, man!

1888
02:45:11,375 --> 02:45:12,000
Bullshit!

1889
02:45:19,042 --> 02:45:19,500
Hello?

1890
02:45:19,583 --> 02:45:22,708
The press and media have come to the station.Did you call them?

1891
02:45:22,833 --> 02:45:23,833
What, the press?

1892
02:45:38,958 --> 02:45:41,000
Officer Arjun is here!Catch him!

1893
02:45:43,042 --> 02:45:43,958
On camera, I mean.

1894
02:45:50,708 --> 02:45:53,167
He's done so much, but acts like he's done nothing.

1895
02:45:53,292 --> 02:45:56,917
Thank you, officer Arjun.You've made our jobs easier.

1896
02:45:57,250 --> 02:45:59,542
How much you have contributed!-He does that a lot, sir.

1897
02:46:00,667 --> 02:46:02,000
Keep up the good work.- Thank you, sir.

1898
02:46:03,250 --> 02:46:04,250
Come here.

1899
02:46:04,917 --> 02:46:08,000
What's going on?-Sir, this is your doing, right?

1900
02:46:08,333 --> 02:46:09,417
You're so modest!

1901
02:46:09,667 --> 02:46:10,208
What?

1902
02:46:10,458 --> 02:46:14,875
When I came in the morning, the smuggled woodand the smugglers were outside the station.

1903
02:46:15,125 --> 02:46:19,333
I thought you caught them as usualand called the Revenue Department.

1904
02:46:19,750 --> 02:46:22,458
Are you out of your mind?- Not so loud, sir!

1905
02:46:26,583 --> 02:46:27,583
I didn't do it.

1906
02:46:27,958 --> 02:46:30,625
Who else?/How do you get it right every time, sir?

1907
02:46:34,542 --> 02:46:36,000
You're a smart one, sir.

1908
02:46:37,042 --> 02:46:41,417
He's so right every time,almost like he's the one transporting it!

1909
02:46:42,708 --> 02:46:43,917
He's a very nice guy!

1910
02:46:47,292 --> 02:46:50,333
Wondering why your own goods arein your station?

1911
02:46:50,417 --> 02:46:53,000
You're not in control, as you think, officer!

1912
02:46:53,917 --> 02:46:55,583
I stand to lose nothing with this.

1913
02:47:06,917 --> 02:47:10,125
It's not just the goods that were caught;Your men were caught with it.

1914
02:47:10,208 --> 02:47:13,958
Upon enquiry, he's willing to talk.He could talk to the Revenue Officers, too.

1915
02:47:14,042 --> 02:47:16,583
Think about what would happen to you then.

1916
02:47:16,667 --> 02:47:18,333
The Press is here, too.

1917
02:47:21,167 --> 02:47:23,667
This was the mosquito that bit me when I wasasleep the other day, right?

1918
02:47:24,333 --> 02:47:25,625
What did I tell you?

1919
02:47:25,833 --> 02:47:29,417
I told you, if I wake up one day andone SWAT!, you're POOF!- done for.

1920
02:47:30,917 --> 02:47:32,750
It’s done for.- I know!

1921
02:47:33,583 --> 02:47:34,583
What do you want?

1922
02:47:36,625 --> 02:47:37,792
Release Velu annan.

1923
02:47:38,375 --> 02:47:40,375
How is that possible?We've got evidence.

1924
02:47:43,833 --> 02:47:46,500
Like you need lessons in deceit, officer!

1925
02:47:46,667 --> 02:47:50,250
Get one of your own men to surrenderand get Velu annan out or else…

1926
02:47:50,417 --> 02:47:51,792
Punching Bag!- Present, sir!

1927
02:47:53,375 --> 02:47:55,500
Just checking!How did you do it, sir?

1928
02:47:55,625 --> 02:47:59,333
It was superb.The area has been better since you came.

1929
02:48:02,208 --> 02:48:04,667
Ask him one by one, he'll answer patiently.

1930
02:48:04,917 --> 02:48:06,375
May I leave, officer?

1931
02:48:07,250 --> 02:48:09,542
Move, move./Careful, don't share it on WhatsApp!

1932
02:48:24,292 --> 02:48:26,833
Release Velu?Don't do it, man.

1933
02:48:27,500 --> 02:48:28,833
You've been an enemy all along.

1934
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:32,333
But I was an insider who betrayed their trust.He would be very pissed off with me.

1935
02:48:32,708 --> 02:48:36,542
Not just that, Maari's position will geteven stronger if Velu is out.

1936
02:48:37,292 --> 02:48:39,375
What can I do?Want me to get arrested, instead?

1937
02:48:40,125 --> 02:48:42,167
Your man has been caught red-handed.

1938
02:48:42,833 --> 02:48:45,875
This was the one thing you had to do.And you've screwed that up, too.

1939
02:48:46,292 --> 02:48:47,292
Look what's happened now!

1940
02:48:47,542 --> 02:48:50,125
Don't get worked up.We'll all get locked in if we're caught.

1941
02:48:50,250 --> 02:48:52,833
That's why I'm telling you, Velu has to be released.

1942
02:48:53,167 --> 02:48:56,333
Velu has lost his political supportafter he went to jail.

1943
02:48:56,667 --> 02:48:57,708
Even if he's released now…

1944
02:48:58,333 --> 02:49:00,917
He can't touch a policeman without support.

1945
02:49:01,583 --> 02:49:02,333
We’ll deal with it.

1946
02:49:02,458 --> 02:49:05,583
You're a cop, so you'll be okay.What if he targets us?

1947
02:49:06,833 --> 02:49:07,750
That's your problem.

1948
02:49:07,958 --> 02:49:09,792
Sir, you're disassociating yourself?

1949
02:49:09,958 --> 02:49:12,583
Look, it's your man who's been caught.

1950
02:49:13,292 --> 02:49:15,417
I can still get you in trouble and escape.

1951
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:18,292
Be happy that I haven't done that.

1952
02:49:18,833 --> 02:49:21,750
Try to transport the goods safely from now.

1953
02:49:24,708 --> 02:49:26,667
What's happening, anna?He's saying such things….

1954
02:49:27,667 --> 02:49:29,208
And there's no respect these days.

1955
02:49:30,542 --> 02:49:32,167
We need to be careful with him.

1956
02:49:41,750 --> 02:49:42,458
Move aside!

1957
02:49:42,917 --> 02:49:43,500
Move aside!

1958
02:49:45,792 --> 02:49:46,292
Greetings, anna.

1959
02:49:46,333 --> 02:49:47,333
Stop.

1960
02:49:47,500 --> 02:49:48,500
Anna is here.

1961
02:49:48,667 --> 02:49:49,792
Come Maari. Honour him.

1962
02:49:50,833 --> 02:49:51,958
Move aside.

1963
02:49:52,667 --> 02:49:53,958
Welcome, anna.

1964
02:49:54,458 --> 02:49:54,958
Maari...

1965
02:49:56,333 --> 02:49:57,583
Get up... Get up.

1966
02:50:03,958 --> 02:50:04,458
Dad!

1967
02:50:08,833 --> 02:50:10,917
I told you not to go there!

1968
02:50:11,417 --> 02:50:13,500
Are you okay?-I'm okay, dad.

1969
02:50:13,708 --> 02:50:16,792
How did you get released?-They released Velu annan first.

1970
02:50:17,125 --> 02:50:19,625
Then they said it was the same caseand released all of us.

1971
02:50:19,875 --> 02:50:21,958
Maari is the cause for our release.-Yeah?

1972
02:50:22,292 --> 02:50:25,625
When I heard that you'd been released,I knew you'd get me out somehow.

1973
02:50:26,375 --> 02:50:28,208
But why did you use this evidence?

1974
02:50:28,833 --> 02:50:29,708
It's gone waste!

1975
02:50:29,917 --> 02:50:32,125
You're out of prison.What more do we need?

1976
02:50:32,500 --> 02:50:36,542
If we'd gone to Revenue Department,we could have gotten back at him.

1977
02:50:37,042 --> 02:50:38,542
Or even finished him completely.

1978
02:50:38,833 --> 02:50:41,250
Think I'll let the guy who got you locked up get away?

1979
02:50:41,625 --> 02:50:43,333
I'll take special care of him.

1980
02:50:43,750 --> 02:50:44,750
You forget about it, anna.

1981
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,792
Tomorrow is the festival of lights.And you're out of prison!

1982
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,542
You just watch our atrocity in our area today!

1983
02:50:51,875 --> 02:50:53,833
See, they're celebrating our arrival.

1984
02:50:53,958 --> 02:50:55,292
Stop right there!

1985
02:50:55,625 --> 02:50:57,125
The area is done for today!

1986
02:50:57,250 --> 02:50:59,750
Take a still, Maari.I'll come too!

1987
02:51:02,250 --> 02:51:03,708
Come, let's go.- Where, anna?

1988
02:51:03,875 --> 02:51:05,292
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1989
02:51:05,458 --> 02:51:06,750
Stop it! About turn.

1990
02:51:08,292 --> 02:51:09,417
Buzz off!

1991
02:51:10,125 --> 02:51:11,208
Come here, beautiful.

1992
02:51:15,208 --> 02:51:17,208
Check out this look!

1993
02:51:20,583 --> 02:51:23,000
Send him./Just send him off, Maari.

1994
02:51:25,750 --> 02:51:27,125
Maari. Let go.

1995
02:51:27,375 --> 02:51:29,500
Saw that? He's started his atrocity again.

1996
02:51:29,583 --> 02:51:31,833
Keep quiet. I owe my release to him.

1997
02:51:33,500 --> 02:51:34,167
Buzz off.

1998
02:51:35,250 --> 02:51:35,833
I'll be back!

1999
02:51:35,917 --> 02:51:37,708
Go get a haircut. Go!

2000
02:51:38,167 --> 02:51:41,292
Maari, it's thanks to you that our menhave been released.

2001
02:51:41,458 --> 02:51:42,000
What?

2002
02:51:44,042 --> 02:51:44,708
What a pity!

2003
02:51:45,125 --> 02:51:47,667
Who got your men out?I only got Velu annan out.

2004
02:51:47,833 --> 02:51:50,500
You were just free add ons.Get out!

2005
02:51:51,417 --> 02:51:53,000
Hi, dude!- Hi!

2006
02:51:54,292 --> 02:51:55,917
Look at all the reverence.

2007
02:51:56,833 --> 02:51:58,375
How's it going, man?- Fine, man.

2008
02:51:58,458 --> 02:51:59,667
Give me a hi5, man.- Cool!

2009
02:51:59,833 --> 02:52:00,875
You fool.

2010
02:52:07,167 --> 02:52:09,000
They're here?It's the festival of lights indeed.

2011
02:52:09,167 --> 02:52:10,417
Start collecting in all the shops.

2012
02:52:14,375 --> 02:52:15,542
Oh, it's that guy.

2013
02:52:17,042 --> 02:52:17,667
Prem.

2014
02:52:17,833 --> 02:52:19,125
Go to the street vendor.

2015
02:52:23,625 --> 02:52:24,167
Like that!

2016
02:52:29,792 --> 02:52:30,417
Hold it!

2017
02:52:30,875 --> 02:52:32,500
What, they're back?

2018
02:52:32,708 --> 02:52:35,250
Pay up the money.- It's festival time…

2019
02:52:35,542 --> 02:52:36,958
So what if it's festival time?

2020
02:52:37,167 --> 02:52:38,208
Pay up!

2021
02:52:41,875 --> 02:52:42,500
Pay up, man.

2022
02:52:42,833 --> 02:52:43,958
Someone is going to get it!

2023
02:52:46,125 --> 02:52:48,208
Anna, pay up. I want to go home!

2024
02:52:54,958 --> 02:52:57,708
It's not unusual to collect,right, Maari?

2025
02:53:00,292 --> 02:53:00,875
Poor fellow.

2026
02:53:03,417 --> 02:53:04,333
There!

2027
02:53:07,583 --> 02:53:09,500
Anna, at least you pay up, please?

2028
02:54:09,667 --> 02:54:15,000
He'll break your ribs, the King of Con;Can't toss him a bone, he's the don.

2029
02:54:16,042 --> 02:54:17,250
You’re wearing make up?

2030
02:54:18,292 --> 02:54:21,750
Oldie, walk away or I'll light up this cracker on you.

2031
02:54:24,333 --> 02:54:25,625
Come, I’m going.

2032
02:54:30,667 --> 02:54:31,958
Poor girl, this Sri.

2033
02:54:38,583 --> 02:54:42,125
This is the usual amount.Return this back to them.

2034
02:54:46,542 --> 02:54:48,125
Festival wishes to you!- Same to you.

2035
02:54:48,167 --> 02:54:50,000
I love you all.- Bye!

2036
02:55:32,875 --> 02:55:35,750
I know it looks crooked, my path.

2037
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,708
All you straight-forward guys, get out!

2038
02:55:38,875 --> 02:55:42,167
It might feel a bit wrong;but it's right.

2039
02:55:42,500 --> 02:55:45,083
Don't get it?Don't bother.

2040
02:55:45,250 --> 02:55:48,500
This light of our livesIs Maari the Great!

2041
02:55:48,792 --> 02:55:51,417
Even the policeSalute him!

2042
02:55:51,750 --> 02:55:54,958
Stay if you want to;Or walk away.

2043
02:55:55,208 --> 02:55:58,125
Good times are here!

2044
02:56:55,500 --> 02:56:58,500
Bend over;And people stab you in the back.

2045
02:56:58,708 --> 02:57:01,500
So stand tall;That's the only life hack.

2046
02:57:01,875 --> 02:57:04,875
When finding a partnerIs like finding trouble;

2047
02:57:05,042 --> 02:57:07,958
Being a lonerMakes so much sense.

2048
02:57:08,167 --> 02:57:10,833
Don't you say such things, son.

2049
02:57:11,042 --> 02:57:14,042
We are one, now and forever.

2050
02:57:14,250 --> 02:57:17,208
Do what feels right, son.

2051
02:57:17,458 --> 02:57:20,708
The doors to my home are open, for you.

2052
02:57:20,917 --> 02:57:23,958
I was born alone; I'll die alone.

2053
02:57:24,042 --> 02:57:27,167
I don't need any family.

2054
02:57:27,292 --> 02:57:30,292
Her words oozed honey;She came into my life.

2055
02:57:30,458 --> 02:57:33,375
She ruined me;Why did I bother?

2056
02:58:33,125 --> 02:58:35,000
Have the birds returned from training?

2057
02:58:35,167 --> 02:58:37,417
We flew fifty; Only twenty have returned.

2058
02:58:39,208 --> 02:58:40,208
What about Maari's?

2059
02:58:40,542 --> 02:58:43,167
He flew thirty; All thirty have returned.

2060
02:58:45,292 --> 02:58:46,250
What's funny?

2061
02:58:47,417 --> 02:58:48,917
I told you the other day.

2062
02:58:49,958 --> 02:58:52,708
That you'd come to me for helpas the race draws closer.

2063
02:58:53,875 --> 02:58:55,208
What can you do?

2064
02:58:56,833 --> 02:58:58,333
He can't participate without his birds.

2065
02:58:59,042 --> 02:59:00,875
No, don't do that. Be quiet.

2066
02:59:01,458 --> 02:59:03,625
You don't understand the seriousnessof pigeon fancying business.

2067
02:59:05,500 --> 02:59:07,708
Make sure he doesn't do anything.

2068
02:59:10,167 --> 02:59:12,583
Officer Arjun, you've done so much for us.

2069
02:59:13,042 --> 02:59:14,042
Let us handle this.

2070
02:59:14,292 --> 02:59:16,333
Who says I'm doing this for you?

2071
02:59:18,167 --> 02:59:19,000
He should feel pain.

2072
02:59:20,042 --> 02:59:21,625
We need to hit him where it hurts.

2073
02:59:21,792 --> 02:59:23,708
Don't do anything without Ravi anna's consent.

2074
02:59:25,792 --> 02:59:27,125
It's already done.

2075
03:01:07,167 --> 03:01:07,500
Maari.

2076
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:10,375
Ten of our pigeons are dead.

2077
03:01:11,292 --> 03:01:13,458
They've set it on fire when we weren't around.

2078
03:01:13,917 --> 03:01:16,833
It was that girl Sridevi, who opened the cagesand saved the pigeons.

2079
03:01:17,292 --> 03:01:19,417
If it wasn't for her, all the birds would be dead.

2080
03:01:20,125 --> 03:01:22,625
She burnt hands while trying to save the birds.

2081
03:01:23,583 --> 03:01:25,833
She was here when they burnt the cage.

2082
03:01:26,458 --> 03:01:28,458
If she hadn't been there, all the birds would be dead.

2083
03:01:32,208 --> 03:01:34,625
They say pigeons never return to a burnt cage.

2084
03:01:35,417 --> 03:01:36,417
They’d have gotten scared.

2085
03:01:37,167 --> 03:01:38,750
Our pigeons will never return, anna.

2086
03:01:41,417 --> 03:01:43,250
Maari, don't mistake me for saying this.

2087
03:01:43,750 --> 03:01:44,958
Let's leave this place.

2088
03:01:45,667 --> 03:01:49,083
There's nothing here for us.Why should we suffer here?

2089
03:01:49,542 --> 03:01:52,375
Velu anna is back now.Let him deal with the police.

2090
03:01:53,458 --> 03:01:54,917
Why should we struggle?

2091
03:01:55,417 --> 03:01:56,917
They could have attacked us!

2092
03:01:57,250 --> 03:01:59,375
What did the poor birds do to them?

2093
03:01:59,708 --> 03:02:01,208
I know you'll refuse…

2094
03:02:01,833 --> 03:02:04,292
But, it hurts to see you like this. Maari.

2095
03:02:04,667 --> 03:02:05,792
Let's get out of here.

2096
03:02:07,125 --> 03:02:09,750
Punchingbag, pack our thingsand get the vehicle ready.

2097
03:02:11,792 --> 03:02:12,333
Go on!

2098
03:02:22,208 --> 03:02:22,708
Saturday.

2099
03:02:23,875 --> 03:02:24,542
Look there!

2100
03:03:30,833 --> 03:03:32,708
You said pigeons don't return to a burnt cage.

2101
03:03:34,958 --> 03:03:35,750
How did they return?

2102
03:03:38,042 --> 03:03:39,792
The birds know this is their home.

2103
03:03:40,500 --> 03:03:41,500
But you don't realise it.

2104
03:03:44,917 --> 03:03:46,333
This has to end today.

2105
03:03:49,375 --> 03:03:50,792
I told you not to do anything!

2106
03:03:51,125 --> 03:03:53,083
Everyone found out that we set fireto his loft.

2107
03:03:53,292 --> 03:03:55,417
I've been banned from pigeon racing altogether!

2108
03:03:57,042 --> 03:03:57,917
What about it?

2109
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:00,875
My dignity is lost!

2110
03:04:01,708 --> 03:04:02,917
I can't race pigeons anymore.

2111
03:04:03,708 --> 03:04:04,542
Stop yelling!

2112
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,167
Following my word got you this far.

2113
03:04:08,292 --> 03:04:09,750
So what if you can't race?

2114
03:04:10,750 --> 03:04:12,208
Playing with pigeons…

2115
03:04:12,417 --> 03:04:13,792
You won't understand that.

2116
03:04:14,125 --> 03:04:15,958
It's an ancestral sport.

2117
03:04:16,458 --> 03:04:17,792
You're following his instructions now?

2118
03:04:17,875 --> 03:04:19,375
Anna, don't just hit me!

2119
03:04:19,667 --> 03:04:20,750
You're just a label.

2120
03:04:21,292 --> 03:04:23,667
It's Officer Arjun who plots the action.

2121
03:04:25,417 --> 03:04:27,000
So you're supporting him?

2122
03:04:27,458 --> 03:04:29,958
Fools, do you know what you've done?

2123
03:04:30,333 --> 03:04:32,708
Do you know what Maari would doif you lay a finger on his pigeons?

2124
03:04:33,083 --> 03:04:34,625
What would he do?

2125
03:04:34,792 --> 03:04:36,417
He was just waiting for the right moment.

2126
03:04:36,875 --> 03:04:39,208
You’ve taunted him.He will come!

2127
03:06:19,542 --> 03:06:20,458
Maari, listen to me!

2128
03:06:24,708 --> 03:06:25,708
Don't do this, Maari.

2129
03:06:34,292 --> 03:06:37,875
I only kept quiet this longas you were a cop.

2130
03:06:38,750 --> 03:06:41,000
But you've touched my pigeons.

2131
03:06:41,333 --> 03:06:44,208
I'll kill you and go to prison again.

2132
03:06:49,792 --> 03:06:51,083
I'm sorry, Maari…

2133
03:08:11,833 --> 03:08:13,125
Maari, wait! Listen to me.

2134
03:08:14,583 --> 03:08:15,208
Wait, Maari.

2135
03:08:17,083 --> 03:08:18,917
Listen to me, Maari.

2136
03:08:19,208 --> 03:08:21,917
I forbade that policeman,but he threatened us to do it.

2137
03:08:22,167 --> 03:08:23,917
I had nothing to do with your loft burning.

2138
03:08:24,042 --> 03:08:25,792
I know all about the frauds he's committed.

2139
03:08:26,042 --> 03:08:27,667
I am willing to testify anywhere, anytime.

2140
03:08:28,875 --> 03:08:32,208
I don't even trust a good man.Why would I trust filth like you?

2141
03:08:35,792 --> 03:08:36,792
You were saying?

2142
03:08:37,875 --> 03:08:39,625
You'll kill me and go to prison?

2143
03:08:41,292 --> 03:08:44,667
I'll say you killed him for revengeand get you locked up.

2144
03:08:56,833 --> 03:09:00,167
You crook! I told you not to trust him.

2145
03:09:09,833 --> 03:09:12,042
Round up everyone.No one should escape.

2146
03:09:12,250 --> 03:09:13,833
Come on fast.You go that way.

2147
03:09:27,042 --> 03:09:29,125
Maari, wait. Don't hit him!

2148
03:09:44,292 --> 03:09:44,917
What was that?

2149
03:09:46,167 --> 03:09:47,167
You always say...

2150
03:09:47,667 --> 03:09:48,833
"I'll finish you off!"

2151
03:09:49,583 --> 03:09:50,667
See what I've done?

2152
03:09:51,250 --> 03:09:52,667
Now I've finished you.

2153
03:09:54,042 --> 03:09:56,250
You'll spend the rest of your life in prison.

2154
03:09:58,042 --> 03:09:59,042
Drag him away.

2155
03:09:59,708 --> 03:10:00,917
What are you doing?

2156
03:10:01,292 --> 03:10:02,417
That's not our man.

2157
03:10:02,542 --> 03:10:03,542
That's the man. Get him.

2158
03:10:04,667 --> 03:10:05,917
Let me go!

2159
03:10:06,125 --> 03:10:07,708
Sir, why are you arresting me?

2160
03:10:08,333 --> 03:10:09,458
Let me go.- Stop.

2161
03:10:09,792 --> 03:10:11,583
They've told us what you do.

2162
03:10:26,417 --> 03:10:28,417
I've got a guy in the Revenue Department.

2163
03:10:29,750 --> 03:10:31,375
I'll be restored to my old power.

2164
03:10:32,167 --> 03:10:36,708
All I need is an eye-witness to everythingthat Arjun has committed.

2165
03:10:36,958 --> 03:10:37,375
Sir.

2166
03:10:37,792 --> 03:10:39,583
I'm not afraid, with Maari and you by my side.

2167
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:41,500
I'm willing to talk openly.

2168
03:10:46,875 --> 03:10:50,292
What did you say? You'll finish me?

2169
03:10:53,292 --> 03:10:55,542
That was nice. You said it real nice.

2170
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:58,375
And don't come out, okay?

2171
03:10:58,792 --> 03:10:59,625
Just stay inside.

2172
03:10:59,875 --> 03:11:00,875
You'll be safer there.

2173
03:11:48,250 --> 03:11:53,292
Sub-Inspector Arjun has been arrested byRevenue Department for smuggling red sanders.

2174
03:12:18,458 --> 03:12:21,542
I can't decide whetheryou're a good guy or a bad guy.

2175
03:12:22,833 --> 03:12:23,917
Why do you doubt it?

2176
03:12:24,125 --> 03:12:25,000
Of course I'm a bad guy!

2177
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:27,292
Good guys can't be trusted.

2178
03:12:27,667 --> 03:12:29,167
They can turn bad at any point.

2179
03:12:29,542 --> 03:12:32,917
Men who appear to be good but do bad,are even worse.

2180
03:12:33,292 --> 03:12:35,792
But a guy, who openly claims to be bad…

2181
03:12:36,167 --> 03:12:38,500
…but does some good, can be trusted.

2182
03:12:39,708 --> 03:12:40,708
I trust you.

2183
03:12:42,792 --> 03:12:43,625
So what?

2184
03:12:44,667 --> 03:12:48,667
I feel like a lie from a long time back...

2185
03:12:49,542 --> 03:12:51,875
...has become the truth now.

2186
03:12:52,792 --> 03:12:53,958
I'm serious.

2187
03:12:54,292 --> 03:12:57,000
I really do like you now.

2188
03:12:59,833 --> 03:13:01,292
Oh dear.

2189
03:13:02,167 --> 03:13:03,125
No, madam.

2190
03:13:03,667 --> 03:13:04,750
No thank you!

2191
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:08,375
This romance thing won't suit my character.

2192
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:11,917
I've got my pigeons, my boys…

2193
03:13:12,167 --> 03:13:14,125
And I've got the area people to troublewhenever I'm bored.

2194
03:13:14,167 --> 03:13:16,625
I’d be free and happy like thisall the time.

2195
03:13:16,875 --> 03:13:20,500
You think about it, we could just befriends if you want.

2196
03:13:22,333 --> 03:13:22,875
Okay?

2197
03:13:23,792 --> 03:13:24,417
Bye.

2198
03:13:57,792 --> 03:13:59,375
Take a photograph!

2199
03:14:00,292 --> 03:14:01,542
Move aside.

2200
03:14:03,333 --> 03:14:04,000
Look at that!

2201
03:14:05,792 --> 03:14:06,375
Maari.

2202
03:14:06,708 --> 03:14:09,000
It's been so peaceful since Arjun left.

2203
03:14:09,292 --> 03:14:12,208
It's been so many years sincewe lived without paying bribes.

2204
03:14:12,292 --> 03:14:14,083
For living peacefully in this area without fear...

2205
03:14:14,542 --> 03:14:18,167
We don't know how to repay this debt, Mr Maari.

2206
03:14:18,250 --> 03:14:19,625
Look at him, bluffing.

2207
03:14:23,250 --> 03:14:25,417
All the money I lost while in the prison...

2208
03:14:26,542 --> 03:14:28,750
All the compensation money in this period…

2209
03:14:29,292 --> 03:14:31,583
The money you have saved fromnot paying my cut.

2210
03:14:32,125 --> 03:14:34,000
Plus service charge and service tax;

2211
03:14:34,792 --> 03:14:35,375
Seven lakhs.

2212
03:14:35,500 --> 03:14:36,500
Amounts to seven lakhs.

2213
03:14:37,500 --> 03:14:39,875
If all of you pay me that money...

2214
03:14:40,167 --> 03:14:41,417
We'll call it even.

2215
03:14:41,667 --> 03:14:42,875
What's he saying?

2216
03:14:46,792 --> 03:14:48,500
Maari is so funny!

2217
03:14:49,042 --> 03:14:49,875
Look at him.

2218
03:14:51,708 --> 03:14:54,792
I'm talking seriously here.You think I'm being funny?

2219
03:14:56,500 --> 03:15:01,292
Settle this within a month orthe treasury first and then your throat.

2220
03:15:01,458 --> 03:15:02,167
You rogue!

2221
03:15:02,292 --> 03:15:04,125
So you're going back to rowdyism?

2222
03:15:04,208 --> 03:15:06,167
Did I ever claim to have reformed?

2223
03:15:06,375 --> 03:15:08,208
Maari will always be this way.
