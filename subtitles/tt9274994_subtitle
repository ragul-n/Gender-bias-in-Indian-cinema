1
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,000
Come with me, I will tell you

2
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,850
Give it on my hand, why are you dropping it down?

3
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,050
Ouch, my back!

4
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,640
Fantastic! No name or address given

5
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,850
People just walk in as they please

6
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,850
This is Government hospital, not any kind of charitable home

7
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,430
No medicine... nothing

8
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,050
We had pursued a degree in Nursing, not in Magic

9
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,850
there goes another guy,

10
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,640
his matter is settled

11
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,850
Whoever it may be, I will say point blank

12
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,230
I am not afraid of anyone

13
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,440
I've been doing this job for a long time

14
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,890
Are you still lying here?

15
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,300
Don’t you want to go?

16
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,680
If you have any friend’s number,
let me know.

17
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,180
Don’t even have that?

18
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,680
"Will the birds come now in rows"

19
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:29,220
"Flapping their wings, carrying grain-stalks"

20
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,680
"With great cleverness, they can somehow"

21
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:40,970
"Escape from the small traps"

22
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,430
"My right, I choose my path based on them"

23
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,430
"There are bars to stop me on the way"

24
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,050
"I will need to listen to the blames of people"

25
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,850
"my mind will be disturbed by all these"

26
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,850
"My fate, my future, I will be asked about these"

27
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,850
"There are many routes to find the answer"

28
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,550
"I still have the courage left to
find light from the dark corridors"

29
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,050
"The molten day’s end resemble waves"

30
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,430
"Kindled with flaming fire"

31
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,430
"Rejoice till you are tired"

32
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,430
"Till the anger of the shore ends"

33
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,850
"In each glance, there is fear caused by the waves"

34
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,430
"The world is awake;

35
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,430
the snake-like track shakes"

36
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,850
"When smoke spreads across the river,"

37
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,550
"Will the birds come now in rows"

38
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:41,550
"Flapping their wings, carrying grain-stalks"

39
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,430
"With great cleverness, they can somehow"

40
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,430
"Escape from the traps"

41
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,550
"My life is bright now,"

42
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,550
"with much desire, I'm looking forward to future"

43
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,430
"When we attain the target, the world will be shocked,"

44
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,550
"We will work hard till then"

45
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,430
"This is the beginning, no turning back now,"

46
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,550
"We have so much to attain, that's why we hurry,"

47
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:23,430
"We will have this smile of our faces till the end,"

48
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,050
"The heart must revel till the sky like rain"

49
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,050
"The body must feel warmth soon"

50
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,550
"It should rain continuously"

51
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,100
"At dawn, when the day is inflamed by shadows"

52
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,050
"Is there dance of fire in the furnace"

53
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,100
"When the drums are beating,"

54
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,050
"Did the rhythm of heartbeats increase"

55
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,970
"Like a ritual dance that fills one's heart?"

56
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,430
"Like the sea hiding the depths"

57
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,430
"Like the smoke covering the sky,"

58
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,430
"You should hide your feelings"

59
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,430
"Dart through the new paths

60
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,430
"Forget the past as the story progresses"

61
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,430
"From the sharp arrows are being shot"

62
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,430
"With great care"

63
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,300
It’s dead.

64
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,050
Yes.

65
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,510
Our dog is mad at us.

66
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,350
He hasn’t come with me.

67
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,470
If Solomon brother meet him,

68
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,010
He will come happily.

69
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,550
Here, keep it there.

70
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,510
Have you been waiting for a long time?

71
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,100
Did he know that he would be remanded?

72
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,350
I had told him that
there is little chance to get bail.

73
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,680
How can he get bail?

74
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,050
That place was rented to run theatre,

75
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,050
He should run a theatre there.

76
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,350
If he lets people gamble money playing cards

77
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,550
It’s not like that dear,
You come with me.

78
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,430
Let’s go inside the office and talk.

79
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,600
Padma, what do you know about it?

80
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,720
Everyday they play cards
and do gambling for 4-5 lakh rupees.

81
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,050
Who are these guys?

82
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,350
Where do they come from?

83
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,100
Which money are they using?
Does he know anything?

84
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,050
If the affidavit for Sreejith Divakaran is ready,
Take a print of it.

85
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,390
Yes Madam, I will take.

86
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,010
It’s not like that dear, Come!

87
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,850
He leased that theatre for 2 years.

88
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,680
But he couldn’t run it for even 6 months.

89
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,970
He did all these as he had no other way.

90
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,850
He has been doing it for the last one year.

91
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,430
There was no complaint about it till now.

92
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,050
Now Sadasivan boss
wants him to be out from there.

93
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,260
He is planning to start some business there,

94
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,050
So, you don’t have any problem with him
for doing gambling there.

95
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,930
He has been remanded for 14 days.

96
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,180
We can submit bail application within 2 days.

97
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,550
As he is in Sub-jail, it’s not a big problem.

98
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,300
Nobody can cause him any trouble.

99
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,300
I am on the way to see the doctor.

100
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,390
See you then,

101
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,350
What did the doctor say?

102
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,970
He can give only medicines.

103
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,140
We need to find peace on our own.

104
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:50,890
Ramya!

105
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,180
We need to move the bail application for Stalin.

106
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,390
Get the memo ready for that.

107
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,390
Ok Madam,

108
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,930
Sir,

109
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,220
Stalin John!

110
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,350
You are the guy who used
to run that theatre, aren’t you?

111
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,430
Yes sir.

112
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,720
Why are you here?

113
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,510
Movies are not successful these days.

114
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,600
Are you old enough to be remanded?

115
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,050
You can give a try,

116
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,390
Maybe this place will improve.

117
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,180
It’s your place, right?

118
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,470
I heard that you’re the one
who doesn’t show any improvement.

119
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,890
That could be true.

120
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,300
Everyone else is good.

121
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,720
Or Sadasivan boss won’t
have to send police to hit me.

122
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,640
He could do that directly.

123
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,010
I’m an unruly guy,

124
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,850
Not just outside, inside too.

125
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,550
Take him.

126
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,720
Bro!

127
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:54,350
In the allegation of receiving bribe of 500 crores
from an American company named VMS,

128
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,050
the verdict against Padmanabhan Nair
will be delivered today.

129
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,430
Brother!

130
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,220
Who died?

131
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,970
When there was no response,
I thought

132
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,680
I need a box.

133
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,720
It should be long-lasting.

134
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,050
Is there any box with lock?

135
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,680
It’s for burying a person,

136
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,260
Not to lock someone, right?

137
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,550
What’s the size of the person?

138
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:22,970
Is he big?

139
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,350
Is it made of teak?

140
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,600
He can sleep inside for
2-3 years without any trouble.

141
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:55,640
(praying)

142
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,890
You won’t say it, will you?

143
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,850
- Hello,
- Yes Sir,

144
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,470
Sir, it’s confirmed,

145
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:10,930
Will arrest him now.

146
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,390
Where is sir now?

147
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,350
He is at home.

148
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,890
Will you arrest him from his house?

149
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,300
Solomon, why do you speak like
you don’t know anything?

150
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,640
After taking the bribe of 500 crores,

151
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,180
Didn’t he live happily for
7-8 years during the trial?

152
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,430
Now he has to go to jail.

153
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,510
Or the public will handle us.

154
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,050
I’m only worried if he will faint
when we go to arrest him.

155
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,390
For that also,
he needs to have an attitude.

156
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,260
Ok then, will call you later.

157
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,180
Ok.

158
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,140
Praised be Jesus.

159
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,930
Now and always.

160
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,510
I have never seen you here before.

161
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,720
- My father’s graveyard is here.
- Where?

162
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,050
It’s been around 15 years since he died.

163
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:57,970
Here.

164
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,140
Father, I would like to buy a new tomb,
if it’s available.

165
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,720
We usually give one to a family.

166
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,050
Did you meet your father?

167
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:09,930
Yes,

168
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,850
You may leave.

169
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,470
Solomon brother, did you see this?

170
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,600
Brother!

171
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,890
Can't you bring a Car?

172
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,550
What was going on!

173
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,470
Hugging, inviting home for lunch,

174
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,050
Proposing for marriage,

175
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,010
Will have to find another job.

176
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,640
What job can we find?

177
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,550
Not me, for you.

178
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,550
I can earn enough riding this truck
and delivering cooking gas.

179
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,350
Last one week,

180
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
I was dreaming Policemen whenever I slept.

181
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,930
Did you take that gun from the theatre?

182
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,470
I took it home when the police came there.

183
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,550
What’s there to say this much?

184
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,550
Nothing?

185
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,220
Dear Annie, I want to buy a four-wheeler.

186
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,300
Why didn’t you tell me about it?

187
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,720
If I tell you, you will deny it.

188
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,260
Do one thing,

189
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,510
They are waiting outside,
Ask them to leave,

190
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,510
Then you will be relieved.

191
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,550
How much it will cost?

192
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,930
It will cost a bit.

193
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,260
A bit means?

194
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,140
A bit means

195
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,350
I can’t lie to you.

196
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,890
It will cost around 60 lakh rupees.

197
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,850
If I ask you something,
Will you tell me the truth?

198
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,720
Of course.

199
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,390
Where’s our dog?

200
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,430
I killed it.

201
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,300
How long it had been with us?

202
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,260
Dear, dogs are supposed to be
more sensible than humans.

203
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,050
But that dog was not sensible at all.

204
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,600
Won’t we kill if it were a human?

205
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,850
Won’t we feel like killing?

206
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:53,100
Your son is in jail
and you are cooking delicious food here!

207
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,850
I thought you would come to visit me.

208
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,100
But no one came

209
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,600
And they didn’t give me the phone too.

210
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,680
It might be an insult to the old police officer
to visit her son in jail.

211
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,680
Mummy!

212
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,510
Even if the parents grow older,
their children are always young for them.

213
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,850
You will understand it later,

214
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,760
That you should have built
your life and not police cases.

215
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,010
You’re right.

216
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,260
The things that I did when I was 18,

217
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,970
I felt they were all wrong when I became 25.

218
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,850
What I did when I was 25,

219
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,430
Now I feel they are wrong.

220
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,720
As you said,
I might feel after many years that

221
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,010
what I did is not right.

222
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,890
But now, I feel that I need to do this.

223
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,430
I felt like doing this now.

224
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,350
Please note it down.

225
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,470
Hello Mujeeb

226
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,970
When were you released?

227
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,720
Not released, I broke out.

228
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,430
Don’t sit there all the time,
Try to jump and run.

229
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,100
Stalin!

230
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,720
You got released!

231
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,640
Where are you going?

232
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,140
Comrade Sadasivan has locked it.

233
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,470
Don’t try to mess.

234
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,600
You don’t know how powerful he is.

235
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,300
Mujeeb, this is a small place.

236
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,100
So, everyone knows each other.

237
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,720
Not because someone is greater than others.

238
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,180
Dude Stalin,

239
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,510
I just warned you as
we worked for the same party before.

240
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,140
Whatever we do here,
No one will dare to stop us.

241
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,680
Mujeeb,

242
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,760
Don’t challenge a whole place.

243
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,050
There might be someone.

244
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:07,260
Didn’t see you for a long time.

245
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,010
Achaya, what’s up?

246
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,050
Did you lose?

247
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:20,100
I’m losing, What to do Stalin?

248
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,430
We need to recover everything that we lost.

249
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,930
Yes, we should.

250
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,180
Those are Manaf’s friends.

251
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,760
Tell him that I will kick him away,

252
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,720
If he sends this kind of people.

253
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,180
I am yet to recover from the harm done by him.

254
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,050
Some of Kerala Congress candidates are winning.

255
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,600
That’s how they are.

256
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,300
Also, Krishnan Nair and team of Nair lobby.

257
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,010
Heard that he got a
sack of black money accidentally.

258
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,720
Also, our old District judge and three thieves.

259
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,930
Looks like the Judge will fail.

260
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,350
Bro, it’s been a long time
since we paid the electricity bill.

261
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,760
We will pay it later

262
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,720
The case charged is gambling by playing cards

263
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:41,010
And man-handling the policeman
who came to arrest him.

264
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:46,890
Is Sadasivan here?

265
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,930
You mean Comrade?

266
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,680
No, Mulleppalli Sadasivan.

267
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,600
Yes.

268
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,850
Comrade,

269
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,550
The lease is for 2 years,

270
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,300
6 more months are left.

271
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:05,760
Don’t ask me to leave.

272
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,350
I don’t have any other place to go.

273
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,850
Stalin, this is party office.

274
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,050
Not a place to express your sentiments.

275
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,760
It was like that before, comrade.

276
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,850
Only when you started preaching
this nasty communism,

277
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,640
I became a party supporter.

278
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,180
Supporter!

279
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,640
You can pretend to be a communist

280
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,890
And also turn down communists for your own benefits.

281
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,760
Right?

282
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,220
You should not pretend to be a communist,

283
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,850
You should live as a communist.

284
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,180
So, what I am telling you is

285
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,760
Don’t send anyone to teach me communism.

286
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,720
You will have to count stars!

287
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,850
I don’t need to explain you who this Stalin is.

288
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:02,640
Red salute,

289
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,350
Mujeeb, where are you?

290
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:11,890
Brother, no use of opening it
again without getting a proper deal.

291
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,600
Why do you need aproper deal
for gambling by playing cards?

292
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,510
Then, you open it,

293
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,680
Then the police will come.

294
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,100
And you will be arrested again.

295
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,890
Need to call Mr. Rajan Mulankad.

296
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,680
Will make that guy call SP.

297
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,050
SP will call the local station.

298
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,010
That’s the only way to
work it out for the time being.

299
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,260
If the special squad comes…

300
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:35,850
We will see it then.

301
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,720
I’ve been calling him since you got arrested.

302
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,970
Would the party members have erased him?

303
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,050
What’s up dude?

304
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,140
This will take some time

305
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,850
It was with great effort that
I learned to roll it from Youtube.

306
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,100
Else you do one thing,

307
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,850
You pay the money to UFO.

308
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,180
If you had managed it properly,

309
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,140
I would have run it showing adult videos.

310
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,350
Oh, my phone is full of those videos.

311
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,300
I am tired of watching those.

312
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,890
What happened?

313
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,100
Did it get tangled again?

314
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,680
Brother!

315
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,640
- Come fast.
- What happened?

316
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:52,470
What happened?

317
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,300
The KSEB guy has removed the fuse.

318
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,260
What?

319
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,600
I had told you many times to pay the bill.

320
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,010
She’s bringing it,

321
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,430
You call Mr. Rajan Mulankad.

322
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,430
Give that fuse back.

323
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,680
You pay the bill,
then the fuse will come back.

324
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,640
I’m telling you to put the fuse back.

325
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,930
Talk respectfully,

326
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:09,850
Give it to me.

327
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,510
Brother, she’s asking me to talk respectfully.

328
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:17,850
Did you call Rajan Mulankad?

329
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,510
Yes, his phone is switched off.

330
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,470
He might have been drunk.

331
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,510
Call him today itself
and get this lady transferred.

332
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,100
Is that the urgent thing now?

333
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,350
Else, will you stand here
with a candle at night?

334
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,180
PW Brest house!

335
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,180
No, Guest house!*

336
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,850
Oh, rest house.

337
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,890
Suresh brother,

338
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,180
Is Rajan Mulankad here?

339
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,100
Nobody’s here.

340
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,890
Naughty guy!

341
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,640
You are sitting here reading Fire.

342
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,140
Do you know where is?

343
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,680
He has gone to Delhi to meet the High command.

344
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,010
Will be back after 2 days.

345
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,350
Anything urgent?

346
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,890
If it’s urgent, can you show?

347
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,720
Yes, I will show.

348
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,680
Not this.

349
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,220
Can you show him?

350
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,470
Just the size of a peanut.

351
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,050
And he is reading fire!

352
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,100
Do you have cigarette?

353
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,550
Sorry, I don’t have.

354
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,510
I had one with me.

355
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,850
What’s this?

356
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,050
Oh, it was there.

357
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,640
You can’t smoke here.

358
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,680
What?

359
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,930
It’s a sacred place to read Fire.

360
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,260
Come, let’s go.

361
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,430
I haven’t believed your Delhi story.

362
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,260
Where is this guy gone switching off the mobile?

363
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,890
That’s what I’m also thinking.

364
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
If we could meet him,

365
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,140
He would have done everything.

366
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,890
He is definitely somewhere around here

367
00:30:43,220 --> 00:31:06,600
(lady’s voice heard)

368
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,640
Where are you going?

369
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,640
Move away!

370
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,260
Leave me!

371
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,180
I will call the Chief minister.

372
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,510
Keep quiet, I will dump you in the forest.

373
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,010
Rajettan!

374
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,890
Open,

375
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,140
Open

376
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,640
Stalin, please don’t create any issues.

377
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,140
Go away!

378
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,180
Didn’t I tell you that it is rest house?

379
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:29,930
Please leave,

380
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,180
It’s the order of the high command,

381
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,300
To stop shooting.

382
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,930
Everything is for the public.

383
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:40,970
Fine sir.

384
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,220
Ok sir.

385
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,600
Nothing, no problem.

386
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,470
As SP had called,
I don’t want to say anything.

387
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,180
But tomorrow if any superior asks me,

388
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,800
I will get him.

389
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,140
Then nobody should interfere.

390
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:04,140
Sir, if anyone calls,
you just inform about it.

391
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,890
He will get everything ready.

392
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,180
Then I will take all these things
and go with him.

393
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,260
Fine?

394
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,180
(whispering)

395
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,600
You wait,

396
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,430
Get up!

397
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,550
Sir, you may also leave.

398
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,720
Come on!

399
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:33,720
Stalin,

400
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,850
It will end up in a big game.

401
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,760
Have you got enough confidence for that?

402
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,510
Sir, the show will begin at 10 pm.

403
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,760
It will continue till 2 am.

404
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,850
The same place from where you arrested me.

405
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,720
One who can say things openly like this,

406
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,510
Don’t underestimate his confidence.

407
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:15,850
Don’t you have the bill?

408
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,510
I don’t have.

409
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,600
The system is not working,
So, I need the bill.

410
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,260
An officer working here has taken the fuse away,

411
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,430
They will know about it.

412
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,890
There are so many cases where fuse was removed.

413
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,180
How would I know which is yours?

414
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,430
Dear, you know that closed theatre?

415
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,350
It’s for that.

416
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,640
If you had paid the money on time,

417
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,470
Would there be any trouble?

418
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,720
See how much money you have paid as fine.

419
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,890
Even after paying all this money,
they say that the board is in loss.

420
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,930
They are joking.

421
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,680
Look at that bungalow,
they are very rich.

422
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,970
Comrade, it’s a shame.

423
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,640
With the help of that stupid Rajan Mulankad,

424
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,430
He opened that theatre again.

425
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,220
Let him open it.

426
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,850
Only if it’s open, we can close it.

427
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,100
All this is happening while our party is ruling.

428
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,800
He is dealing with the police
easily using that guy from other party.

429
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:06,850
Dear, did you add cashew nuts?

430
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:07,720
Yes sir.

431
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:13,100
Mujeeb, police are not messing
with us as our party is in rule.

432
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,720
These policemen like the other party members more.

433
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,470
What day is today?

434
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,550
Wednesday?

435
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,220
Wednesday,

436
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,800
Tomorrow is Thursday.

437
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,470
Day after is Friday.

438
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,100
On Friday, we will get Stalin John out of that place.

439
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:30,100
You just need to say a word,
we will take care of the rest.

440
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,850
No one from our party should touch him.

441
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,760
I should not hear that anyone
from our group caused him any trouble.

442
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:41,640
On Friday, we will get him out.

443
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,350
Saturday and Sunday are holidays for court.

444
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,140
I will play the first show in the theatre on Sunday.

445
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,680
Will see the rest in the court on Monday.

446
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:54,430
Do you think we can throw him
out easily like a cat?

447
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,970
He is a proud man.

448
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,100
How can he live here after
getting hit by the local people?

449
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,300
Else he has to surprise us.

450
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,010
We need to bring a guy
who doesn’t have any address.

451
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:17,010
Stalin John will count the stars.

452
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,350
Dude, what’s the matter?

453
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,010
Can’t you call me back
when you see my missed call?

454
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,850
I was talking to Setu.

455
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,470
What’s your program?

456
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,100
I need to go to Kerala.

457
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,720
I have got a work to hit someone.

458
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,760
I have to hit a guy and come back.

459
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,100
Nobody should know about it.

460
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:31,680
Have you received the cash?

461
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,050
I got the advance amount.

462
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,100
Already we are involved in a case there,

463
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,010
Would we get trapped if we go?

464
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,510
Let’s do one thing,
let’s have a drink.

465
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,470
I don’t have any money.

466
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,050
You said that you got the advance amount.

467
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,640
That was only a little bit.

468
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:44,930
Two drinks are enough.

469
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,930
I won’t drink.

470
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,100
You need not drink.

471
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,640
Only I will drink.

472
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,140
These guys keep thinking
about drinking all the time.

473
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,050
Nothing else.

474
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,760
(vomiting)

475
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,100
Sit there,

476
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,180
Your phone is ringing.

477
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:19,510
Hello,

478
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,550
Are you Suhas?

479
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Where are you now?

480
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,180
Suhas, it’s for you.

481
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,760
It’s for you.

482
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:29,930
Hello,

483
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,850
Are you Suhas?

484
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:35,260
He is in a meeting.

485
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,180
When will the meeting be over?

486
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,850
I can’t say that.

487
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,100
Where’s the meeting?

488
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,180
It’s in a police club.

489
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,640
God, is he arrested?

490
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,180
Who are you?

491
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,720
Me… Is it about hitting the guy in theatre?

492
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,100
- Yes, are you business partners?
- Yes.

493
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,510
That’s nice.

494
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,010
Can’t you come?

495
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,180
I need to get the job done tomorrow itself.

496
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,760
I already agreed it.

497
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,640
What about the money?

498
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,140
Didn’t Suhas tell you?

499
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,010
You will get the money
as soon as you finish your work.

500
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,470
You do one thing,

501
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,100
call someone else.

502
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,850
Need to get it done tomorrow itself.

503
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,850
I shall tell you openly,

504
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,640
I will send you my account number.

505
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:25,100
We shall talk in detail once
I receive the money.

506
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,350
What’s your problem?

507
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,220
I’m asking you.

508
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,850
I have nothing to say.

509
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,720
I’m asking you the reason for that.

510
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,260
I don’t need to tell you the reason.

511
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,140
What’s the matter that you can’t tell me?

512
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,970
Did your father betray your mother?

513
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,430
"Even though there is no distance between us"

514
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:37,390
"Do you still feel the distance"

515
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,140
"When we part in two ways"

516
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:52,260
"When we part, it is as
if the shore of death has come"

517
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:59,430
"When we are together,
it is late to understand"

518
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,260
"To know love, is it necessary"

519
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,550
"For having such a distance between us"

520
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:29,390
"Though no one caresses me"

521
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:37,180
"There is your memory near me for sprinkling coolness"

522
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:07,930
"Even if we feel offended often,
and weave a veil"

523
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:15,260
"There is no secret between us"

524
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:22,510
"You have become my eyes clearer than my own"

525
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:28,260
"You made me your eyes also"

526
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:35,430
"As the root for life and wings to fly high"

527
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:43,720
"Are there any other boundaries?"

528
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:16,550
Hello,

529
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,350
Where are you?

530
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,300
I’m at home.

531
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,220
You need to come here urgently.

532
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,140
What’s the matter?

533
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,930
Have you given any cheque to anyone?

534
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:23,850
Cheque?

535
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,220
I have given a cheque to the
Babychettan’s finance company.

536
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,390
That cheque has bounced.

537
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,180
The liability is 25 lakhs.

538
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,430
They are waiting here.

539
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,850
You come here quickly.

540
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,140
Hey Nair,

541
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,430
I don’t need 500 crores,

542
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,800
Just 2 crores,

543
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,850
At least 1 crore,

544
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,100
Isn’t it, Mummy?

545
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,100
I will be back soon,

546
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:26,220
Because they came to me,
I could inform you about it.

547
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,300
Else you would only know
when you receive lawyer’s notice.

548
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:32,010
I gave that cheque to the
Finance company as a bail for Manaf.

549
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,800
It’s a matter of only 5 lakh rupees.

550
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,300
That idiot didn’t pay it back.

551
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,140
How would I know that he will
cheat these people with that?

552
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,430
They had taken a loan from
the bank against their property.

553
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,720
Soon it will get attached.

554
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,180
These finance people helped them to pay the loan.

555
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,010
And for the rest of the money,
they gave this cheque.

556
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,220
Can’t they check it properly before receiving it?

557
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,430
That old man went to collect the cheque,

558
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,930
The girl was not with him.

559
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,720
You do one thing,

560
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,760
I will call that girl,
we will ask for some time.

561
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,220
- That won’t work.
- Why?

562
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:59,390
Even if we try hard to
show that we are great people,

563
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,180
There are some situations,

564
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:02,430
That tell the world that

565
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,050
We are nothing in this world.

566
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,220
She has seen me in such a situation.

567
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,220
My name is Stalin John.

568
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,050
I gave that cheque to help a friend.

569
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,600
I didn’t know it can cause such a big problem.

570
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,890
You can move legally if you want.

571
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,220
But Padmavati is my lawyer.

572
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:33,010
You will have to find
another lawyer to run the case.

573
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,220
I know that you don’t have anything with you.

574
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,930
And I won’t get anything
if I sent you to jail.

575
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,010
I shall sign a promissory note for you,

576
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,430
Or I will give you my phone number.

577
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,220
I will accept whenever you call,

578
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,390
Even if I don’t,
you can know where I am.

579
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,050
It’s the first time in my life
that someone else owes us money.

580
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,300
So, you can understand the situation in my house.

581
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:02,930
Betty, come!

582
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:05,600
Don’t run!

583
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,600
Stop there.

584
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,930
I told you not to run.

585
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,350
Betty,

586
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:15,140
Did you like it?

587
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,220
Yes, I did.

588
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,930
Whom do you like more, me or the dog?

589
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:19,970
The dog.

590
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,760
He came only today.

591
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,300
You keep him with you for some time.

592
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,850
Then only you start liking him.

593
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,300
Only after that let him inside your house.

594
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,430
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

595
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:35,930
Go and play.

596
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:40,760
How about you?

597
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,260
What?

598
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,220
Don’t take it to the forest.

599
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,600
I will be back now

600
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,760
Why are you here, in the uniform?

601
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:00,350
Nothing.

602
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,050
These days many arrests are happening.

603
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,350
What are you talking?

604
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:05,430
Just be careful,

605
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,300
That’s it.

606
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:07,050
Sir,

607
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,350
Didn’t you see the news?

608
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,550
But Sir is very strong.

609
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,390
Whom to fear when he has 500 crores with him.

610
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:18,430
Still, why didn’t the party leaders help him
when such a big amount is involved.

611
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,510
After the arrest,
no one said a word to support him.

612
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,800
That’s because,

613
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:26,970
No one got a penny out of that 500 crores.

614
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,510
He didn’t involve anyone in that deal.

615
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:34,720
Solomon, what’s your role in this?

616
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,220
They won’t be left alive,

617
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,430
he who tells and he who listens.

618
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,600
Why did you buy such a big bottle?

619
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:50,930
To make me drunk?

620
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,800
After paying the electricity bill and grocery bill,

621
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:58,220
There wasn’t enough money to buy your single malt.

622
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:59,140
Here you are.

623
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,100
Hey Pappu,

624
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:06,800
Have you ever got insulted?

625
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,510
Did you feel sad about it?

626
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:16,600
You are sad because you get
insulted once in a while.

627
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,720
I don’t feel sad
as it happens to me every day.

628
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:20,930
Get lost scoundrel.

629
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:26,890
Where are you going?

630
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,050
To buy some food.

631
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,760
Do you have money?

632
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:32,760
I don’t have, will borrow some.

633
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,220
Don’t borrow from anyone.

634
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,140
God, hope there will be some balance left.

635
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:03,760
- Sir,
- Yes,

636
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:04,890
Am I late?

637
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,510
I can only wait,

638
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:12,600
Used to wait for Padamanabhan Sir before,

639
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:13,890
Now waiting for you.

640
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,220
I had visited Padmanabhan sir in jail.

641
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:22,800
As I’m his accountant,

642
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:26,890
I have showed him all the accounts till now.

643
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,430
What is left is your accounts.

644
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,390
Padmanabhan Sir is 74 years old now.

645
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:52,010
He is becoming very adamant these days.

646
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,510
That I can understand.

647
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:59,390
Sometimes he talks like
I’m stealing all his belongings.

648
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,430
He is like that.

649
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,600
When all the accounts were checked,

650
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,600
There was a mismatch of 2.5 crores.

651
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,510
You should talk to him about that.

652
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,220
Solomon, what’s your plan?

653
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,430
Padmanabhan is sleepless these days.

654
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,510
He keeps on asking about the money to be given
to his daughter in Australia and son in Dubai.

655
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:24,800
What shall I do?

656
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,050
Tell him that we will give everything.

657
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:28,350
But not now.

658
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,720
If we take it out now,
no one will get anything.

659
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:31,970
Let this mess settle down.

660
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:32,970
And let me finish some urgent things.

661
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,390
We will settle everything.

662
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:38,050
He handed over 500 crores to me
and is relaxing in the jail.

663
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:43,220
Solomon, if you can’t, you may leave.

664
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,930
It’s not because we don’t have
anyone else to keep the money.

665
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,390
Sir, please don’t get tensed.

666
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,010
Padmanabhan sir is on our side.

667
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:53,220
It’s because you keep on drinking scotch.

668
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:56,010
I shall send some local toddy with Mani,

669
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,220
Have two drinks,

670
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,720
Then you will understand what I’m talking.

671
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:05,300
God,

672
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:11,050
Solomon, my drinking experience is more than your age.

673
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,180
(news reading in Radio)

674
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,050
Former Industries Minister
and the Cultural Leader Padmanabhan Nair

675
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:31,220
Was arrested yesterday
with the order from the court.

676
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:40,510
He had been accused of corruption for a
very long time for receiving 500 crores as bribe.

677
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:50,760
This led to political turmoil and ended up
in his arrest yesterday from his house.

678
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:51,510
Sir,

679
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:55,390
Someone is here to meet you.

680
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,390
A man or woman?

681
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,600
It’s a man.

682
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:07,890
Can I have a nail cutter?

683
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,390
What’s the current situation?

684
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,180
The news has been published on newspapers.

685
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:15,550
Not that,

686
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:17,510
Have you received the money?

687
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:18,600
It is safe.

688
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,140
Don’t keep anything with you for the time being.

689
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,100
Do as I say.

690
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,220
You be safe.

691
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:26,850
Don’t get into any trouble.

692
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:27,760
I will be at home.

693
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:29,100
You may leave.

694
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:35,470
Potty said that 2.5 crores are in your account.

695
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,800
I told Potty that,

696
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,720
If Solomon has taken it,
there will be a valid reason.

697
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:45,010
Sir, I took it when there was an emergency.

698
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,140
I forgot to tell you.

699
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,600
Potty is an old-fashioned man.

700
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,010
One crore is with me.

701
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,430
I will replace the amount
that I had spent in 2 weeks’ time.

702
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,890
Whatever you have spent,
I know it’s for us.

703
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,260
Don’t worry about that.

704
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,260
Keep that one crore with you.

705
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:02,180
Do you understand?

706
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:03,350
I shall hand it over to Potty.

707
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:04,930
You can keep it.

708
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,470
Solomon, money is dangerous.

709
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,890
In future, we both should not have
to fight with each other.

710
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:16,890
An amount of 500 crores, is a lot of money.

711
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:20,510
Both of us may not want to give it up.

712
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,600
Is everyone fine at home?

713
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,470
Fine sir.

714
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:48,760
- Hey,
- Yes,

715
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,800
Do you have spare cooking gas cylinder?

716
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:51,930
Ours is about to finish soon.

717
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,140
I shall bring it.

718
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,390
Bro, the guy who did it is an outsider.

719
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,220
Mujeeb was boasting about it sitting in the shop.

720
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,180
If we could find out where he was from,
we could have taken revenge.

721
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:12,430
Let me bring the gas cylinder.

722
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,800
I had saved few to sell in black market.

723
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:16,390
Mom, I am leaving.

724
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:17,760
See you then.

725
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,550
What you said can’t be done.

726
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:53,220
They have clear account of all the stuffs.

727
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,430
- How much money do you need?
- Money is not the problem.

728
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,550
This will cause problems,
then you will be caught.

729
00:55:58,850 --> 00:55:59,430
And after that we will also be caught.

730
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,390
Do you understand?

731
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,390
This is not a simple job.

732
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,800
All of us will go to jail.

733
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:12,720
Shall I leave?

734
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:13,510
Wait dude.

735
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,430
I shall give two small pieces.

736
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,180
Don’t get me into any trouble.

737
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:23,930
You do one thing,

738
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:25,930
Come home for Diwali.

739
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,350
We will crack it in the front yard.

740
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:40,010
- Trying to mess with us,
- What?

741
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,800
I was telling that to him.

742
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,430
Seems they don’t know that time has passed.

743
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:46,800
Wait and see.

744
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:50,890
I will find the betrayers this time.

745
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:51,970
As if you will.

746
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:52,850
Hey,

747
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:56,760
If you tell this to anyone,
you know me, don’t you?

748
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:58,720
I don’t do like that.

749
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:07,350
Stalin, you want cutting or shaving?

750
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,470
I came to read the newspaper.

751
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:20,300
What happened?

752
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,600
, ,

753
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:29,800
My plan is not to go fishing
in Sadasivan’s swimming pool.

754
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:32,300
Bro, we are not good enough for that.

755
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,390
We will be in trouble.

756
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:35,600
This is a small place.

757
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,050
Stanley, it’s non-bailable.

758
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,220
Not just me, nobody can win it.

759
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:42,510
I’m sure about it.

760
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:43,930
Don’t do that.

761
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,050
You will go to jail.

762
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,140
I’m advising you as your lawyer.

763
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,350
One more thing,

764
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:49,260
In our country,

765
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,850
There is a limit to do things for everyone.

766
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,600
That’s same for Vijay Mallya
and also for Stalin John.

767
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,800
How many cases have been charged against you?

768
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,050
Stalin, this is the limit.

769
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:02,430
If you do anything more,
you won’t exist.

770
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:04,550
Sister,

771
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,470
This is my habit since school days,

772
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,180
I don’t care how great one is or what he has,

773
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:14,180
If he hits me 100 times,
I will hit back at least once.

774
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:15,430
If I am not good enough for that,

775
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,470
This Stalin John will work as a
ticket seller in Sadasivan boss’s theatre.

776
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,470
Sadasivan has got some goons out,

777
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:43,010
Only at night,

778
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,220
As the relevant case is a blast case

779
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:06,470
And as the court is considering the arguments of the
accused,

780
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,640
The court is considering the argument that

781
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,890
The cylinders used for explosion
were used for cooking purpose.

782
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,930
Hence, the court sentences the accused
for 4 years imprisonment and

783
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,760
A fine of Rs.50,000.

784
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,350
Comrade,

785
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,050
Hey, don’t think that everything is over with this.

786
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,140
You will never see your family again.

787
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,640
Go to jail,
I will show you what I can do.

788
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:49,640
Comrade, I exploded the theatre using gas cylinder.

789
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:52,260
I had put some crude bombs also.

790
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:54,390
I didn’t hear it exploding.

791
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,050
Be careful when you go there to clean.

792
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,800
If it explodes, you won’t have
hands left to call the slogans.

793
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:20,180
Sir, they are making plans to trace the money.

794
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,390
I heard.

795
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,010
Have you got cigarette?

796
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:32,140
Lighter please.

797
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:33,680
They took away the lighter.

798
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:40,640
They are checking using the details from bank
and other stuffs like notes.

799
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:44,260
Padmanabhan Nair received the bribe in dollars.

800
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,100
American dollars.

801
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:50,260
From which bank can they get the serial number.

802
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:55,930
A third person can’t touch
that money unless one of us surrenders.

803
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:57,930
If you surrender,

804
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,300
Solomon, it’s American dollar,

805
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,600
It doesn’t have Gandhi’s head,

806
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:07,140
I will forget that I’m Gandhi’s follower.

807
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:23,430
Are you new here?

808
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:24,640
Yes Sir

809
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:27,300
- What’s the charge?
- A small blast case.

810
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,550
You’re not a terrorist, are you?

811
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:33,680
Go to G block,
they will show you the way.

812
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,720
Do you want a beating or will you sing a song?

813
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,680
I will sing, sir.

814
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:44,720
Then sing.

815
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:49,140
(singing a tamil movie song)

816
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:49,930
Enough, stop.

817
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:50,760
Walk

818
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:20,550
Mani!

819
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:23,430
At what age did your father die?

820
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,140
May be around 70 years.

821
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:28,970
Padmanabhan is also around 75 years old.

822
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,760
Solomon brother, he won’t die any time soon.

823
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:32,550
Why?

824
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:36,550
He has got a wife, family and grandchildren.

825
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:39,800
So much of wealth also,

826
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:43,350
Rich people don’t die fast.

827
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:45,930
If he doesn’t have any money,
will Padmanabhan die soon?

828
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,180
Even then, he won’t die.

829
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:49,470
What can make him die?

830
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:53,800
All human beings in this
world die due to one reason.

831
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:56,760
Suppose we get trapped in a place,

832
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:00,430
And when we realise that
there’s no way to get out of there,

833
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,050
We will die there.

834
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:06,760
The scientific name of that death is frustration.

835
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:09,760
How much did you drink?

836
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,050
Four pegs

837
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:22,100
What a foul smell!

838
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:24,010
How much did you drink?

839
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:26,260
Mani had drunk too much.

840
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:28,010
How about you?

841
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:30,800
We had it together.

842
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:32,350
So, it might be four.

843
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,140
- Annie
- Yes,

844
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:57,430
Which is better,
to kill a person or to lie to him?

845
01:04:58,510 --> 01:04:59,470
I don’t understand.

846
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:06,970
Which would be better,
to kill you or to lie to you?

847
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:09,180
If you are drunk, just keep quiet.

848
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:22,930
(A Visual from a film)

849
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,100
What happened Solomon,
why are you so upset?

850
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:30,510
Sir, there is a problem.

851
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:32,680
Maybe it’s just a doubt.

852
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,550
Say it

853
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:39,100
I heard that there’s an
undercover operation being carried out.

854
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,470
I got the information from CI Shahul Hameed.

855
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,390
Who is that?

856
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:46,220
He has come with me to see you.

857
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:48,720
I remember.

858
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:52,220
It would be better
if you talked to your party leaders.

859
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:53,800
They haven’t said anything till now.

860
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:56,800
Now, only they can help us.

861
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:01,430
If it was before I was arrested,
I would have thought about it.

862
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,970
Now, I don’t need to.

863
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:08,550
Solomon, how long would
I have to sleep on this bare floor?

864
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:10,300
At least for 2-3 years, sir.

865
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:13,260
Only by then, we can get that money converted.

866
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,220
I have moved the money to a safe place.

867
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,550
To get it, one will have to kill me.

868
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:27,180
It’s ok to stay in jail
after stealing 500 crores.

869
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:32,300
I decided to do this knowing the consequences.

870
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:35,050
It’s time for lunch.

871
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:39,970
If I don’t eat on time,
it’s hard to digest.

872
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,720
20, 21, 22…

873
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:07,050
Isn’t it enough?

874
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,350
Move away man!
Let him do what he wants.

875
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:19,680
(screaming)

876
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:42,470
Did you understand now, who I am?

877
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:45,010
I just hit you for money,

878
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,300
I don’t have anything against you.

879
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:40,510
Move!

880
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,970
Come on!

881
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:00,180
Come on!

882
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,220
What are you guys watching?

883
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:30,260
Stop them!

884
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:38,470
No, Sir

885
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:41,260
I have given him enough.

886
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:42,640
Leave him

887
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:51,010
Come on! Go there!

888
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:31,550
130/90

889
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:35,350
Sir, there isn’t any big problem.

890
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:37,050
There is a slight variation.

891
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,180
If it repeats, we will have to check.

892
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:46,430
What’s up Potty?

893
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:49,430
Had met Solomon.

894
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:52,390
- Did you tell him about the money?
- Yes

895
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,510
What happened?

896
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,010
Didn’t he say anything?

897
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,430
He did.

898
01:11:58,430 --> 01:11:59,800
But he doesn’t look very confident.

899
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:01,180
Why?

900
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,430
I don’t know

901
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,550
He is still young.

902
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:10,180
Maybe he things he is smart.

903
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:11,760
Let’s wait and see.

904
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:14,760
Sir, I just told you my doubt.

905
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:18,970
He is not saying anything clearly.

906
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,300
Maybe it’s my problem.

907
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:24,050
Then, it’s better for him.

908
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,470
It’s been a long time since I know him.

909
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:41,180
I’ll be back soon.

910
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:43,970
Okay

911
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,930
I had duty in the kitchen

912
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:49,800
What’s your name?

913
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,680
Majeed Abdul Rahman

914
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:55,680
I have written it.

915
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:58,300
Yours is a blast case, isn’t it?

916
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,470
Anything else?

917
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,050
Stalin, are you still angry with me?

918
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,680
I am not angry with you.

919
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:12,430
Also, I have nothing to talk to you.

920
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,140
Can you please listen to me?

921
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,100
While I was in Mangalapuram,

922
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,640
There was an incident in Mampram

923
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:21,050
And they put me in jail saying
I’ve done the conspiracy.

924
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,140
It was a murder case.

925
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,010
I haven’t done that.

926
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,010
But I have done many other crimes.

927
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:30,350
They didn’t punish me for that.

928
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:32,640
Shouldn’t we try to get out of here?

929
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:33,720
Us?

930
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:36,100
It’s possible only if we are together,

931
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:39,100
- To break out of jail?
- No,

932
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:40,800
Through proper channel

933
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:44,430
He will help us only if you are involved

934
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:47,100
You’re the only guy I know here.

935
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:52,800
Majeed, forget the relation
we had for past years

936
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:55,430
And I am telling you not
to call me for such things.

937
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,260
What are you guys whispering?

938
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,350
Any plan to break out of jail?

939
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:00,430
Yes sir,

940
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,970
We have started digging from the other end.

941
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,300
He wants to meet you.

942
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:10,180
Will you go there and meet him?

943
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:15,970
I’m in jail and how can I go to meet him?

944
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:17,260
He is also here.

945
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:22,720
We will do it only if you agree.

946
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:38,050
Come inside

947
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:43,390
Please sit

948
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:53,800
I have been thinking about
reading this book for a long time.

949
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:55,550
I got time only now.

950
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:57,510
Sir

951
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:06,550
This is the special food for VIPs

952
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:09,300
I shall come to the matter.

953
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,720
You have to do certain things for me.

954
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:16,220
I am not sure whether you can do it or not.

955
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,140
But when I read your case diary,

956
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:23,970
Blasting the theatre in daylight

957
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:26,390
And walking through the town without fear,

958
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,640
I find some heroism in that.

959
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:32,550
If you can help me to move things forward,

960
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:36,470
I will take care of your case.

961
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:40,800
I always keep my promises.

962
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:46,260
Have it.

963
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:51,600
After few years,
I will come back here with a better case.

964
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:55,430
Then I shall have this VIP biryani

965
01:15:56,430 --> 01:15:58,300
Ok sir, I shall leave

966
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:02,550
Stalin, you tell me

967
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:06,800
Do you have cigarette?

968
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,260
Why are you wearing dhoti?

969
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:18,350
Just like that,

970
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:20,680
It’s been a while since we met.

971
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:22,300
How’s your health?

972
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,300
I think I won’t die soon

973
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:30,430
My name is not there on the newspapers these days

974
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:35,260
Apart from you, everyone has forgotten about
this case, Me too

975
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:39,260
I can’t stay here anymore

976
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,100
I’m 75 years old now

977
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:46,010
Not sure when will this pacemaker
made in America stop working

978
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:50,390
The two guys I had mentioned,
will come to you.

979
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,300
Save that 1 crore for them

980
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:56,720
Just to correct an old mistake

981
01:17:57,930 --> 01:18:00,640
Sir, I came to tell you
about converting the dollar

982
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:02,180
Don’t do anything

983
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,970
I know you’ve already done
so many things for me

984
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:14,300
Solomon, go home and learn wearing single dhoti

985
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,640
That’s what they wear in the jail

986
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:41,970
Solomon, I’m not your dad to forgive you anymore

987
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:47,390
If you build a wall around me
and fix an iron gate,

988
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:50,180
Did you expect me to stay inside it?

989
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:17,760
I don’t see any variations in ECG

990
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:19,970
Will it work for some more time?

991
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:23,300
Why not? It’s an American Pacemaker

992
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:24,430
It will definitely work

993
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:26,970
Okay, I shall move then,
have to visit patients

994
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:29,720
Sister, Get the results

995
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:37,600
Sir

996
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,350
Sit down

997
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:40,260
Yes Sir

998
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,930
Do you know when one needs to have pacemakers?

999
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,050
When the mind dies

1000
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:52,970
At that time, if one is fixed,

1001
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,720
then there will be no feeling guilt

1002
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:57,220
You can do anything

1003
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,300
You must do me a favour

1004
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:01,760
Get my two boys out from there

1005
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:04,720
One’s term is almost over

1006
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:07,010
How can I, sir?

1007
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,260
Something like Sentence reduction…

1008
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:11,970
Good conduct…
such procedures are there right?

1009
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:15,800
When you release other prisoners
release them also along with them

1010
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:18,350
And they will go without creating any issues

1011
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,890
If I get involved in this case

1012
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:25,140
It may not work with the present political scenario

1013
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,220
They will not let it work

1014
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:30,760
If it is you,
people will think it’s according to the formalities

1015
01:20:30,970 --> 01:20:32,430
Who are the guys, Sir?

1016
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,050
They are not someone who has star values

1017
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,220
But they hold an item

1018
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:41,050
Would you mind helping me?

1019
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,600
If you had thought the same about my case,

1020
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:47,890
then I would’ve been
sacked from job long ago

1021
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,050
So, they will be out, won’t they?

1022
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:02,260
I lost the job

1023
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:05,140
Now I do food delivery

1024
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,550
and running this taxi

1025
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:09,010
Who is the guy with you?

1026
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:12,850
I don’t think I have seen him
among decent ones

1027
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:16,140
Maybe it’s because of hitting people in the dark

1028
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:21,100
Do you know each other very well?

1029
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,140
We resolved all the issues with a fight

1030
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:30,050
Hope Sadasivan, Mujeeb
and Che guevra are fine

1031
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,800
Comrade has opened his own bank now

1032
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,510
Fantastic

1033
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:41,550
Rs.60 for Biryani…Biryani

1034
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:45,760
This is Vinod , my new staff

1035
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:49,100
If there is any food left out,
distribute it in the Govt. hospital

1036
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:51,720
Let’s have biriyani today

1037
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,260
Okay then

1038
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:09,720
What a surprise! The guy from Dubai !

1039
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:11,930
Did you come empty handed from Dubai?

1040
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:15,600
What I got from Dubai
is not good enough to give you, mom

1041
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:18,470
Who is this guy?

1042
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,430
He’s the one who arranged my visa for Dubai

1043
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,430
Oh…Come inside..

1044
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:26,300
Come

1045
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:38,300
It’s good that I got married in life

1046
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:40,300
A kind of enthusiasm

1047
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:42,470
Children, Grand children..

1048
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:44,720
Don’t want to die

1049
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:46,760
Please don’t feel offended if I ask something

1050
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:50,800
Despite having children,
why did you entrust Solomon?

1051
01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:53,720
It’s the not the salary that the Government had paid,

1052
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:56,220
It’s the commission I demanded

1053
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:59,430
If I give it to my children,
by the time I return from here

1054
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:02,760
They would have fought amongst themselves and died

1055
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:06,970
If I give it, they will have a feeling
that their dad has given it to them

1056
01:23:07,970 --> 01:23:09,180
And that Solomon,

1057
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:13,260
I really underestimated him

1058
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,390
There is no time left now

1059
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:21,510
How will it benefit us?

1060
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:24,800
If you don’t cheat me like Solomon did,

1061
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:26,140
Then your life will be spared

1062
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,970
Just joking

1063
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:36,720
I always keep my promises

1064
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,430
The blows that we get after the age of 60

1065
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:41,800
Will weaken you

1066
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:47,430
Because we know that we don’t have
enough strength or time, to strike back

1067
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:52,760
Padmanabhan Sir, we are just 30

1068
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:58,350
Even if we receive blows, we have adequate
strength and time to strike back

1069
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,600
I will cook a story about you to Solomon

1070
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:06,220
But he will definitely not believe that story

1071
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,760
when you go to meet him, keep that in mind

1072
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:12,470
Don’t accept the cash that he offers you

1073
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:14,390
That’s a test dose

1074
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:18,180
He will try his utmost to avoid giving that

1075
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,510
I believe you guys blindly

1076
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:26,350
Because I know how many kilometers
your bike has run

1077
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:32,510
And Stalin, I even know how much money
your mother receives as widow pension

1078
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,140
Don’t forget to meet Potti

1079
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,600
I got something to tell you

1080
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:10,050
I am leaving for Mangalore tomorrow morning

1081
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:11,220
Why?

1082
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:13,390
I am not sure of your present situation

1083
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:15,430
But it will be good for you to join me

1084
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:24,430
Padmanabhan Nair, 500 Crores,
Solomon, Potti

1085
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:26,350
By the time we finish this drink

1086
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:28,600
I think it will be better for us
to forget all these

1087
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,180
We are like suicide-bombers

1088
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:33,100
But I wish to live

1089
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:36,470
That’s why I approached Padmanabhan
and got out of jail before the punishment period

1090
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:38,760
And it is not for helping him

1091
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,300
Then why the hell did you drag me into this?

1092
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,220
I could have called anyone

1093
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:45,550
But none of them are in jail because of me

1094
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:50,430
I don’t want to move from here

1095
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:52,890
Hope you heard about Solomon

1096
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,850
Majeed, If you go from here,
will that resolve all your problems?

1097
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,760
He even knows how many kilometers
your bike had run

1098
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:04,350
And how much pension my mom receives!

1099
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:07,720
And you talk about hiding in Mangalore?

1100
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:14,890
Isn’t it better to acquire something
rather hiding and dying?

1101
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:38,930
- Did Padmanabhan Sir send you?
- Yes

1102
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:40,050
Was it difficult to find the location?

1103
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:40,970
Doesn’t matter

1104
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:42,010
We located through Google map

1105
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:43,220
Where are you coming from?

1106
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:44,220
A little bit far place

1107
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:45,220
Far means?

1108
01:26:45,390 --> 01:26:47,390
From the Beach road

1109
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:51,430
The money is with my friend

1110
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:52,890
Got to collect it from him

1111
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:55,930
- You came by car, didn’t you?
- Yes

1112
01:26:57,850 --> 01:27:01,220
Maniya! You follow us in the car

1113
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:07,550
I will get ready and be back

1114
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:19,850
Have we met earlier?

1115
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:21,430
No chance

1116
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,510
Where were you?

1117
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:26,350
In Kochi , for a long time

1118
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,720
What were you doing?

1119
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:29,760
I was driving Uber

1120
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:33,890
I also had a driver

1121
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:36,800
- We are going to his brother’s place
- Hmm

1122
01:27:37,930 --> 01:27:40,050
An old friend of mine

1123
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:42,510
Cash is with him

1124
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:47,220
Being a friend,
he made me run a lot for the Cash

1125
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:50,760
And yesterday I contacted him
and said that Padmanabhan Sir needs the cash

1126
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:52,850
If I don’t give you the cash,
Padmanabhan sir will get upset

1127
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:54,550
I can’t offend Padmanabhan Sir

1128
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:56,390
Won’t we get the cash today?

1129
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:57,140
That’s what I have been telling you

1130
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:58,220
His brother was with me for long time

1131
01:27:58,390 --> 01:28:04,930
He deceived me and looted plenty
of my money and flew to Dubai

1132
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:07,350
Unfortunately, the third day,
after reaching Dubai,

1133
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:08,300
in a Mysterious Car accident in Dubai

1134
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,510
He died

1135
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:43,430
Yeah, I will reach there in an hour

1136
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:44,850
Keep the cash ready

1137
01:28:46,350 --> 01:28:47,010
You are at office, don’t you?

1138
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:48,930
Yes I will be there,
I will reach the office soon

1139
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:50,100
Okay dude..

1140
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:18,300
If Solomon asks for me,
say that you don’t know

1141
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:24,550
Didn’t I tell you
that I will be reaching here in an hour’s time?

1142
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:28,350
Hope you are returning home with cash

1143
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:29,550
No Solomon I…

1144
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:51,720
Here is Padmanabhan Sir’s cash

1145
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:54,010
Take it

1146
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:30,390
“The times have changed, we will fight together”

1147
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:37,930
“build an empire with embers in our hearts”

1148
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:44,970
“shall make our own dream world rushing like wind”

1149
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:52,010
“We shall demolish any hell if we stand together”

1150
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:59,140
“What has sprouted in fire
will not wither in sunlight”

1151
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:06,220
“We’ll carry weapons and be ready to win”

1152
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:09,220
“This game of dice is difficult”

1153
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:13,220
“The game of chess continues”

1154
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:16,140
“The dreams weaved together “

1155
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:21,390
“Will not be shattered by anything”

1156
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:37,930
“Let’s climb the steps now without faltering feet”

1157
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:45,010
“with only aim in our mind,
with truth and righteousness”

1158
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:52,010
“Let’s climb the steps now without faltering feet”

1159
01:32:52,220 --> 01:33:00,930
“with only aim in our mind,
with truth and righteousness”

1160
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:02,140
When did you reach?

1161
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:03,180
It’s been few days

1162
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:05,550
You bought a new car?

1163
01:33:05,850 --> 01:33:07,390
Do they pay salary in Jail?

1164
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,850
They gave it for good conduct

1165
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:12,930
I had met Babychayan’s son the other day

1166
01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:15,010
I escalated our cheque case to him

1167
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:17,720
He said his dad will never do that

1168
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:19,970
Immediately he resolved the matter

1169
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,600
Okay

1170
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:42,600
"The times have changed, we will fight together"

1171
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:49,800
“build an empire with embers in our hearts”

1172
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:53,140
“This game of dice is difficult”

1173
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:57,180
“The game of chess continues”

1174
01:33:57,350 --> 01:34:00,050
“The dreams weaved together”

1175
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:04,510
“Will not be shattered by anything”

1176
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:09,050
I won’t remember this

1177
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:12,140
Everything needs to be accounted, right?

1178
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:15,390
Give this account to Padmanabhan Sir

1179
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,720
I don’t deal all this

1180
01:34:16,970 --> 01:34:18,970
We were told that you are his Accountant

1181
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:20,260
That’s why I brought it to you

1182
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:24,600
Not only Padmanabhan’s Sir Cash dealings

1183
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:29,300
I deal with all his accounts

1184
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:31,050
Just a minute

1185
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:33,140
one more please

1186
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,600
Suhas, any news?

1187
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:38,180
Dude, she shifted the house

1188
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:39,220
Some issues I guess

1189
01:34:39,390 --> 01:34:40,930
She lives in Vikas Nagar now

1190
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:44,350
Okay, let me know if you get her number

1191
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,100
Okay dude

1192
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:59,010
I want to set my beard!

1193
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:01,600
Oh Stalin! Please come

1194
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:02,890
Give me 10 minutes

1195
01:35:04,050 --> 01:35:05,140
what about your case?

1196
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:06,300
Trying to Resolve

1197
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:09,050
Two policemen were looking for you

1198
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:12,890
- Police?
- Yes

1199
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:17,430
I revealed all the truth as they were Policemen

1200
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:18,600
Were they in uniform?

1201
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:20,720
No

1202
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:22,470
They look like police by their appearance

1203
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:33,930
You can make out from
their legs they are Policemen

1204
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:54,350
Who is Solomon!

1205
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:56,140
A lad born in Kochi

1206
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,260
Now moved to this place

1207
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:03,220
a tall man with a beard! That’s all

1208
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,760
Run when you ought to!

1209
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:09,220
Otherwise we will be in a fix

1210
01:36:09,390 --> 01:36:11,890
Solomon must have collected all the details about us

1211
01:36:12,510 --> 01:36:14,510
It’s good to keep some distance with him

1212
01:36:15,930 --> 01:36:16,800
Do one thing

1213
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:18,390
Call Potti Sir

1214
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,220
Let’s meet Sir tomorrow morning

1215
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:30,890
Please wait outside for 10 minutes

1216
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:40,350
Solomon had enquired about us in our hometown

1217
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,220
He must have known everything

1218
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:43,720
Don’t meet him anymore

1219
01:36:43,930 --> 01:36:45,140
What if we do?

1220
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,100
Solomon had met me this morning

1221
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:51,260
Never spoke a word of you

1222
01:36:51,970 --> 01:36:54,760
Hope you understood why I said

1223
01:36:58,050 --> 01:36:59,800
Can you arrange a financer?

1224
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:05,800
Don’t bring petty people

1225
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:08,850
Hope you remember how much cash we hold!!

1226
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:13,220
I will talk the rest to Solomon

1227
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:15,470
And if they ask about the terms of repayment?

1228
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,350
Ask for a week’s time

1229
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:24,140
I know how to retrieve cash from
Solomon in a week’s time

1230
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,600
Hello, where were you?
It’s been a long time

1231
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:45,970
Who is this?

1232
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:49,140
I am with him since 2 years,
he is my friend Stalin

1233
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:51,050
I see! I am Arjun Seth

1234
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:56,430
Well, what is the matter?

1235
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:57,600
A profitable deal

1236
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:59,760
Need to convert few dollars

1237
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:01,550
Accounted or unaccounted?

1238
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:04,390
Accounted ones only, but can’t be shown

1239
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,930
If its small dealing, I have people here

1240
01:38:11,930 --> 01:38:13,100
Not small dealing

1241
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:14,220
I know a man

1242
01:38:14,510 --> 01:38:18,720
Only if you are certain about the cash
we can get it done

1243
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:20,720
I am sure about the cash..
Everything is okay

1244
01:38:20,930 --> 01:38:22,100
Show us the man
I will direct you the way

1245
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:23,600
Just visit over there

1246
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:27,140
If you could connect us directly,
we shall go and meet him

1247
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:29,100
I don’t think there is a need for that

1248
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:31,800
And people don’t visit there unnecessarily

1249
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:34,300
What is his name?

1250
01:38:34,510 --> 01:38:35,760
Mohammed Sanafar

1251
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:44,180
Where do you want to deliver the money?

1252
01:38:45,890 --> 01:38:47,760
I mean anywhere in India?

1253
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:49,930
Not entirely

1254
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:52,850
A small amount in Dubai and in Australia

1255
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:55,140
My client’s two children are living there

1256
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,760
And give the rest to me

1257
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,890
In Dubai, I will deliver it immediately

1258
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:03,510
And Australia

1259
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:06,470
I think it won’t be an issue,
My person is there

1260
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:08,680
How much is the total figure?

1261
01:39:08,850 --> 01:39:10,510
70 Million US Dollars

1262
01:39:10,930 --> 01:39:13,800
500 Crores Rupees approximately

1263
01:39:17,470 --> 01:39:19,470
Carrot is very good for your eyes

1264
01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:23,510
So, it’s a dollar transaction

1265
01:39:25,010 --> 01:39:26,970
It is a 2-3 years process

1266
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:32,260
as it is a big amount!

1267
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:36,300
There is a problem

1268
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:40,970
A client wants to convert some dollars

1269
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:42,850
If he doesn't need it immediately,

1270
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:45,430
We shall proceed it tomorrow itself

1271
01:39:58,140 --> 01:39:59,010
Hello Solomon

1272
01:39:59,300 --> 01:39:59,850
Hello Sanafar

1273
01:40:00,050 --> 01:40:03,850
You never responded anything
about the conversion of dollars

1274
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:05,850
Is the rate set?

1275
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:08,970
Two parties have come with similar amount

1276
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:11,300
If you don’t require it immediately

1277
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:13,010
Shall I give a hand to them?

1278
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:17,140
well,in that case, it will take 6 months to do the
transaction

1279
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:19,850
Can you do me a favour?

1280
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:22,850
Can you show me the people?

1281
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:24,390
Can you please show them?

1282
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:33,970
Well what do you say?

1283
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:36,680
You fix the rate

1284
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:38,100
But only one condition

1285
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:40,850
They both shouldn’t leave the place alive

1286
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:47,300
That’s how I run my business

1287
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:53,390
Who are you?

1288
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:54,720
Who?

1289
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:56,470
Oh no!

1290
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:02,140
For such nasty acts, this is what we usually do

1291
01:44:02,350 --> 01:44:03,680
Break into the house and flog

1292
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:12,050
Go inside

1293
01:45:03,890 --> 01:45:07,260
Solomon, 500 Crores that you are holding

1294
01:45:07,470 --> 01:45:08,850
Is parentless cash

1295
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:11,850
Just because of that, don't assume you are the only parent

1296
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,550
Didn’t you break into his house and assault him?

1297
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:55,850
He has lodged an attempt- to-murder case against you

1298
01:45:56,050 --> 01:45:58,640
For trying to kill him, his wife and children

1299
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:01,300
Was there any need for you to resort such a way?

1300
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:02,720
Shouldn’t I atleast retaliate to that extent?

1301
01:46:03,050 --> 01:46:04,600
You could’ve atleast told me

1302
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:08,600
A Policeman, whom I know,
informed me about this

1303
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,510
Otherwise they would’ve arrested you

1304
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:14,010
It is your fortune that Home Minister
has called for a Police Conference now

1305
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,550
All Policemen are there

1306
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:16,930
They will be coming here after the meeting

1307
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:19,100
Better leave the place by dawn

1308
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:22,050
They are Policemen

1309
01:46:22,430 --> 01:46:24,180
They will not spare you!

1310
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:27,930
Solomon would have met the concerned persons
and done whatever has to be done

1311
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:30,720
What should I do now?

1312
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:32,390
Do what everyone does

1313
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:33,430
Go in hiding

1314
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:35,350
Anywhere outside Kerala

1315
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:47,430
I am very hungry, Majeed

1316
01:46:47,970 --> 01:46:49,510
Me too have the same feeling

1317
01:46:51,140 --> 01:46:52,430
Isn't there any fast food shop?

1318
01:46:55,510 --> 01:46:57,600
Am asking you if there are only houses here?
No fast food available here?

1319
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,890
Will your dad run fast food
at wee hours in Mangalapuram?

1320
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:02,010
- Then why the heck..
- Talk softly, dude

1321
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:04,640
Then why the heck you made me walk all the way here!

1322
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:09,720
You needn’t do anything,
I will go and steal food from some house

1323
01:47:10,510 --> 01:47:14,300
What? You will be flogged, mind you

1324
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:15,850
I will get it

1325
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:17,180
Would you eat?

1326
01:47:18,890 --> 01:47:20,600
I won’t eat stolen foods

1327
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:26,800
You wait here, Let me see if
any suitable house there to steal

1328
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:27,720
Hold this

1329
01:47:30,890 --> 01:47:33,800
May be you are used to beatings!
I'm not interested.

1330
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:48,430
You!

1331
01:47:57,890 --> 01:47:59,430
To refrain her from screaming, I did so

1332
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:11,550
You need anything else?

1333
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:12,600
Can I get scrambled eggs?

1334
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,720
Scrambled eggs! What is that?

1335
01:48:15,550 --> 01:48:19,300
We add grated coconut in it,
and the rest are same as Omlette

1336
01:48:19,510 --> 01:48:20,970
Oh I am sorry, there is no coconut at home

1337
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:21,930
Doesn't matter

1338
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:22,970
Is Omlette enough?

1339
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:24,180
No need

1340
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:27,390
My dad used to make

1341
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:33,640
Why did you come all of a sudden in search of me?

1342
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:35,720
Normally you don’t return so fast when you go away

1343
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:37,010
What is the case now?

1344
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:39,010
He assaulted a man in his own house!

1345
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:40,760
That’s why for a hiding..

1346
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:43,800
Is that why you came running here?

1347
01:48:44,510 --> 01:48:46,350
Is everything okay? What?

1348
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:49,100
If everything was okay,
then I would’ve got settled in Dubai

1349
01:48:49,390 --> 01:48:51,760
Police are there too

1350
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:16,180
Chitra, aren’t you at home?

1351
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:20,180
Yeah I am not

1352
01:49:53,390 --> 01:49:54,100
Mummy

1353
01:50:01,890 --> 01:50:27,890
(Funeral Prayers)

1354
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:57,100
(Funeral Prayers)

1355
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:09,050
Sir, I want some water

1356
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:13,300
Sir, he wants some water

1357
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:21,760
Do you want to eat something?

1358
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:22,970
No Sir

1359
01:53:24,180 --> 01:53:25,430
Come, let's move

1360
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:45,720
Stop..Stop

1361
01:53:45,890 --> 01:53:46,430
Sir, Stalin!

1362
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:47,680
Which Stalin?

1363
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:51,100
What the hell are you doing?

1364
01:53:51,510 --> 01:53:52,390
Get down and walk

1365
01:53:53,890 --> 01:53:54,720
Hold this

1366
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:23,050
Heck!

1367
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:29,180
Hello

1368
01:57:29,890 --> 01:57:31,300
Sister, Did you get any news?

1369
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:34,180
No, he has not reached the Station

1370
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:37,800
Even otherwise, there is no use in
enquiring at the station for such cases

1371
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:40,800
Sister, I will call you back

1372
01:57:43,970 --> 01:57:45,930
What happened, bro? Did you get any news?

1373
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:48,010
Things are getting too complicated, Majeed

1374
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:50,010
Police washed their hands off

1375
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:53,300
They say that they are not aware of anything,
what to do?

1376
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:08,760
What a hell is this life!

1377
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:12,930
Mom died and Police also detained you

1378
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:16,010
You loved your mom a lot, didn’t you?

1379
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:18,050
I asked her a lot about you

1380
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:20,050
But she didn’t speak a word about you

1381
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:24,430
It happened by mistake, You forget it

1382
01:58:25,390 --> 01:58:27,180
There is nothing to worry, Stalin

1383
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:30,550
When you had taken it at the
behest of Padmanabhan Nair

1384
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:32,180
You should have brooded over

1385
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,510
We are not innocent boys!

1386
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:44,100
Hello

1387
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:46,300
Write in Padmanabhan Nair’s account

1388
01:59:47,010 --> 01:59:49,510
That Solomon has killed one more guy he had sent

1389
01:59:50,010 --> 01:59:52,760
Hello…hello..

1390
01:59:57,850 --> 02:00:00,680
Dude! Did you watch the new video of Sachin?

1391
02:00:01,010 --> 02:00:03,010
A new one, advising those not wearing helmets

1392
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:05,100
It was very touching

1393
02:00:05,390 --> 02:00:08,680
People do such things for becoming famous!

1394
02:00:08,970 --> 02:00:10,510
Who? Sachin?

1395
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:11,510
Why not?

1396
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:12,640
Talking too bad!

1397
02:00:12,850 --> 02:00:13,970
What bad did I speak?

1398
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:17,760
Why don’t we stop caching frogs,

1399
02:00:18,050 --> 02:00:22,100
and do something better hunting
like pigs or wild buffalo?

1400
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:24,220
Basically, we are hunters

1401
02:00:24,430 --> 02:00:28,220
Hunting small frogs are much difficult
than hunting big pigs? Get me?

1402
02:00:28,430 --> 02:00:29,010
Yeah, come

1403
02:00:29,220 --> 02:00:30,510
Have you seen a gun, bro?

1404
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,390
Asking me if I have seen?

1405
02:00:31,550 --> 02:00:34,640
Once me and my brother-in-law
went to Sholayar Forest for hunting

1406
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:36,180
My sister was Nirvayar(Full term pregnant)

1407
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:36,680
NiraPara!

1408
02:00:36,970 --> 02:00:38,260
I meant Full term pregnant

1409
02:00:38,470 --> 02:00:39,510
I took my brother-in-law’s gun

1410
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:42,470
I suddenly saw something moving in the forest

1411
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:45,260
I brandished a Gun like this

1412
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,470
And shot a bullet

1413
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:47,470
It worked

1414
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:50,640
I shot at the bums of a forest guard!

1415
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:54,470
I am a kind of a man who hunted a person

1416
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:55,390
Really?

1417
02:00:55,550 --> 02:00:56,220
I swear

1418
02:00:56,430 --> 02:00:58,220
You know with what difficulty I solved that issue

1419
02:00:58,430 --> 02:01:02,180
Bro… a man over there .. Look

1420
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:11,260
Hold him

1421
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:27,050
Shucks! Bed has gone dirty

1422
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:30,260
Why are you cleaning this dirty man over here?

1423
02:01:30,470 --> 02:01:32,600
You could have cleaned him outside

1424
02:01:32,850 --> 02:01:34,350
Bringing everything in!

1425
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:37,680
Oh God! My slippers have also gone dirty

1426
02:01:38,300 --> 02:01:39,470
What is wrong with him?

1427
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:40,430
Don’t know

1428
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:42,010
Who brought him over here?

1429
02:01:42,970 --> 02:01:44,470
Two strangers brought him here and left

1430
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:48,050
What a trouble!! Must have fallen down
somewhere in inebriation!

1431
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:55,260
Solomon, hadn’t I thrashed and offered him to you?

1432
02:01:58,220 --> 02:01:59,300
What should I do now?

1433
02:02:00,550 --> 02:02:03,970
You don’t do anything now, help him if possible

1434
02:02:05,470 --> 02:02:06,390
What did you say?

1435
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:09,430
He got paralysed below his waist

1436
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:11,100
He is half paralysed

1437
02:02:11,850 --> 02:02:13,430
And in a very bad shape!

1438
02:02:13,970 --> 02:02:16,140
He can never get up and walk

1439
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:18,140
Dying was safer!!

1440
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:20,850
Padmanabhan’s Cash…

1441
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:23,260
That was rather better

1442
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:25,220
If Potti learns this, he will call me

1443
02:02:25,970 --> 02:02:27,390
Just that Padmanabhan Sir is not fighting with me

1444
02:02:27,550 --> 02:02:29,470
He knows my moves well

1445
02:02:30,220 --> 02:02:34,640
Solomon, Your time is bad…
So please stay quiet

1446
02:02:36,390 --> 02:02:40,050
Police knows how to put him behind bars

1447
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:42,100
I will get that done

1448
02:02:42,550 --> 02:02:46,300
Please make him understand that
there is no point in living like this

1449
02:02:55,970 --> 02:03:01,470
Sir, he can recall everything, can’t he?

1450
02:03:05,970 --> 02:03:06,430
Hello

1451
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:08,550
- Hello.
- Hello Majeed

1452
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:09,600
Yes Pappu

1453
02:03:09,970 --> 02:03:11,390
Tell me

1454
02:03:11,550 --> 02:03:13,010
You know my partner, Vinod..

1455
02:03:13,550 --> 02:03:16,760
he saw a person similar
to bro at Government hospital

1456
02:03:17,010 --> 02:03:18,680
Who? Stalin?

1457
02:03:18,970 --> 02:03:20,050
That's what he told me

1458
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:23,550
Now, I’m at Palani on a trip

1459
02:03:23,970 --> 02:03:25,180
I am just returning from here

1460
02:03:25,970 --> 02:03:27,140
Could you please go and check?

1461
02:03:36,390 --> 02:03:37,550
You want to keep lying like this?

1462
02:03:38,220 --> 02:03:38,850
Don’t you wish to leave?

1463
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:41,640
At least give me any of your friend’s number

1464
02:03:44,260 --> 02:03:45,100
You don’t have that also!

1465
02:04:12,640 --> 02:04:14,350
For whom are you waiting here?

1466
02:04:15,050 --> 02:04:16,470
Couldn’t you give me a call?

1467
02:04:18,010 --> 02:04:21,390
I don’t know your number by heart

1468
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:27,470
Get up and come

1469
02:04:29,180 --> 02:04:31,470
I don’t think I can get up any more

1470
02:04:33,050 --> 02:04:35,430
You need to carry me, is it possible?

1471
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:36,550
What do you mean?

1472
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:41,510
They paralysed my body below the waist

1473
02:04:43,010 --> 02:04:46,800
Police, Solomon and everyone together

1474
02:04:48,100 --> 02:04:49,220
They could do only that much

1475
02:04:57,600 --> 02:04:58,720
And can do that only

1476
02:05:16,850 --> 02:05:17,680
Where are you taking him?

1477
02:05:18,640 --> 02:05:19,470
Taking him home, sir

1478
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:21,970
But the case is not over yet

1479
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:26,220
Do one thing,
Put him in the jeep, We’ll take him

1480
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:29,140
Sir, he is half paralysed

1481
02:05:29,390 --> 02:05:30,390
I am taking him home

1482
02:05:30,550 --> 02:05:31,800
Put him on the jeep

1483
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:35,350
Sir

1484
02:05:40,390 --> 02:05:42,680
Survive doing any petty jobs

1485
02:05:43,050 --> 02:05:45,100
Not now, after the case is settled

1486
02:05:45,390 --> 02:05:47,640
First we need to take you to the Judge

1487
02:05:50,010 --> 02:05:53,470
Without any bruises, take him to the Judge

1488
02:05:58,470 --> 02:06:00,140
I have spoken to Sir about it

1489
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:04,510
Hmm, I will speak to him once again

1490
02:06:04,970 --> 02:06:05,640
Let me try

1491
02:06:06,470 --> 02:06:07,470
Isn’t Prathapan Sir there?

1492
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:09,300
No

1493
02:06:09,470 --> 02:06:11,550
- Then, who the hell is over here?
- Quiet…

1494
02:06:13,430 --> 02:06:14,600
We want to meet Stalin

1495
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,720
Stalin has been taken to Magistrate’s house

1496
02:06:20,430 --> 02:06:21,390
Come, let’s move

1497
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:26,470
Yes, what’s it about?

1498
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:27,970
It’s the case to Sub Jail!

1499
02:06:28,180 --> 02:06:28,760
Bring the accused

1500
02:06:29,050 --> 02:06:29,760
He can’t walk, Sir

1501
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:31,220
- Is he drunk?
- No, Sir

1502
02:06:31,430 --> 02:06:32,470
In the condition of unable to walk

1503
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:33,720
What kind of condition is that?

1504
02:06:39,260 --> 02:06:40,720
What the hell is this?

1505
02:06:41,470 --> 02:06:43,430
Don’t show your Police tricks over here!!

1506
02:06:45,970 --> 02:06:46,640
What is the case?

1507
02:06:46,850 --> 02:06:48,600
Sir, trespassing

1508
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:51,300
IPC 404 and 323

1509
02:06:51,470 --> 02:06:53,390
While taking him to the Station after the arrest

1510
02:06:53,550 --> 02:06:54,220
He jumped out of the jeep

1511
02:06:54,430 --> 02:06:56,220
Did he jump or was thrown out?

1512
02:06:57,260 --> 02:06:59,760
Stop creating evidences on Remand!

1513
02:07:00,260 --> 02:07:02,970
Rather remanding him, take him to the hospital

1514
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:04,970
Open..Open

1515
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:11,300
He might die without water

1516
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:15,760
Sir, I know this case personally

1517
02:07:16,050 --> 02:07:17,680
Police arrested him in front of me

1518
02:07:17,970 --> 02:07:22,100
Few days later, we found him
half paralysed in Government hospital

1519
02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:24,010
I have brought the bail application

1520
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:26,970
If there is any possibility,
please don’t send him to Jail

1521
02:07:27,470 --> 02:07:29,850
Even otherwise I was waiting to send them away

1522
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:33,600
Don’t ever step in here for any case!

1523
02:07:33,970 --> 02:07:34,550
You wait

1524
02:07:41,640 --> 02:07:43,050
- Did you hear what he said!
- Get lost

1525
02:08:33,850 --> 02:08:35,970
Where the heck has he gone!

1526
02:08:38,050 --> 02:08:41,970
He might have heard about my condition,
Let’s wait

1527
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:45,760
Shall we ask him about the cash?

1528
02:08:47,390 --> 02:08:48,550
Hope he recalls us

1529
02:08:51,390 --> 02:08:52,850
All of you wait outside for 10 minutes

1530
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:56,100
Here he comes

1531
02:09:05,180 --> 02:09:07,220
I regret to see you in this condition

1532
02:09:07,850 --> 02:09:08,720
Doesn’t matter, Sir

1533
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:13,850
Hereafter don’t get involved in anything,
Just forget our deal

1534
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:16,300
And don’t meet Solomon

1535
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:18,260
Even though you forget about the money

1536
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:24,220
This Stalin is not ready to forget
even any small loss happened in my life

1537
02:09:24,430 --> 02:09:26,390
Things are not as you imagined

1538
02:09:27,050 --> 02:09:28,970
Depends on people with us!

1539
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:33,350
We want money to go further

1540
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:35,050
My condition has become like this

1541
02:09:35,260 --> 02:09:35,680
Don’t you see?

1542
02:09:35,970 --> 02:09:37,970
I don’t have any money Stalin

1543
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:39,680
Let’s move, Majeed

1544
02:09:42,850 --> 02:09:45,970
Stalin, I will arrange, don’t go

1545
02:09:46,550 --> 02:09:52,140
Solomon is alive only
because of my incompetency

1546
02:09:53,100 --> 02:09:56,010
You also see to it that
you don’t die confined in the cell

1547
02:09:56,550 --> 02:10:00,970
Otherwise after Solomon’s death,
there won’t be any heir left for that cash!

1548
02:10:28,550 --> 02:10:30,640
Don’t give them a single pie

1549
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:34,220
They are of a kind who clutch
on it if they get a little hold!!

1550
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:38,600
Does Padmanabhan still have
cordial relationship with them?

1551
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:41,140
No, he washed his hands off

1552
02:10:45,220 --> 02:10:47,850
And I am well aware,
you don’t have any sincerity towards anyone

1553
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:52,300
That’s why I called you confidently

1554
02:11:00,010 --> 02:11:03,140
I am not with any mongrels in this World!

1555
02:11:12,470 --> 02:11:13,010
Tell me Potti Sir

1556
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:18,470
Stalin, Solomon called me today
and ordered not to give you any cash

1557
02:11:18,850 --> 02:11:19,680
Be careful

1558
02:11:20,260 --> 02:11:22,600
He lays a trap for you!

1559
02:11:23,430 --> 02:11:26,010
You had deposited money in some
finance company, didn’t you?

1560
02:11:27,050 --> 02:11:28,550
Better withdraw it as early as possible

1561
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:35,970
Now look at your condition after playing Underworld!!

1562
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:48,550
Take my losses also into account while settling

1563
02:11:50,470 --> 02:11:52,430
You might have spent some days in jail

1564
02:11:53,300 --> 02:11:55,350
But when theatre razed into fire

1565
02:11:56,470 --> 02:11:58,470
I incurred more losses than you

1566
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:01,470
I will deduct that amount

1567
02:12:04,180 --> 02:12:05,550
Hey come

1568
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:13,260
Do you wish to count?

1569
02:12:16,050 --> 02:12:17,970
Well, my account is settled now

1570
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:27,760
Solomon, go home and learn wearing single dhoti

1571
02:12:28,390 --> 02:12:30,390
That's what they wear in jail

1572
02:12:41,050 --> 02:12:44,220
Didn’t you leave? What happened?

1573
02:12:45,390 --> 02:12:46,220
Car is also there

1574
02:12:46,970 --> 02:12:48,390
Are you sending me away?

1575
02:12:49,300 --> 02:12:51,760
As if you will immediately leave!

1576
02:12:52,050 --> 02:12:54,260
Won’t my dad ask about you if go home?

1577
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:56,760
You never used to send me home

1578
02:12:57,010 --> 02:12:59,180
Tell him that you broke up with me

1579
02:13:00,010 --> 02:13:01,970
Couldn’t you send us to Dubai
if it’s for the matter of 3 days?

1580
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:04,600
My only sister lives there

1581
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:12,510
It’s not for three days, just one day maximum

1582
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:14,720
You will leave today and return tomorrow

1583
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:16,680
There is nobody to manage here

1584
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:19,680
I have some personal dealings

1585
02:13:20,050 --> 02:13:21,470
I can’t entrust that to anyone

1586
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:22,470
That’s why

1587
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:26,510
You look disappointed!

1588
02:13:27,430 --> 02:13:29,140
I know only the Solomon at home

1589
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:33,050
I still not know about your dealings

1590
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:59,510
Go and meet superintendent

1591
02:14:00,180 --> 02:14:01,550
He is a bit scared

1592
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:06,510
Have you brought the phone?

1593
02:14:07,550 --> 02:14:08,970
Hand it over to Superintendent

1594
02:14:12,100 --> 02:14:12,850
Solomon?

1595
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:16,260
I will deal with him

1596
02:14:17,390 --> 02:14:18,220
You may leave

1597
02:14:21,970 --> 02:14:23,550
Keep those boys with you

1598
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:18,180
I should have killed that Stalin

1599
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:19,760
You can’t catch them that easily

1600
02:15:20,220 --> 02:15:21,680
Looks easy to grasp

1601
02:15:21,970 --> 02:15:23,180
But can’t get a hold of them!!

1602
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:25,510
Bring some ice please

1603
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:45,140
Hi Solomon!! Are you enjoying the drink?

1604
02:15:52,180 --> 02:15:52,850
Oh Cognac

1605
02:15:53,550 --> 02:15:54,970
I will also take a gulp then

1606
02:16:04,970 --> 02:16:05,970
Bring ice

1607
02:16:06,390 --> 02:16:06,970
Sir

1608
02:16:11,970 --> 02:16:13,470
- Cheers
- Cheers sir.

1609
02:16:17,430 --> 02:16:18,180
How did you come, Sir?

1610
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:19,600
By car

1611
02:16:21,180 --> 02:16:22,180
Had to come, Solomon

1612
02:16:22,390 --> 02:16:23,800
I’m the one in need

1613
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:29,260
Only that they won’t let me out permanently

1614
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:34,850
To let me out for a single night,
there are courageous Superintendents in Kerala even now

1615
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:38,430
what brings me here is..

1616
02:16:39,430 --> 02:16:40,850
You must give me that cash

1617
02:16:41,390 --> 02:16:42,760
I came here to collect it

1618
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:45,680
Sir, I don’t have it over here

1619
02:16:46,010 --> 02:16:47,760
Don’t you still have it with you?

1620
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:48,850
Yes Sir

1621
02:16:52,550 --> 02:16:53,260
Shall we move then?

1622
02:16:53,470 --> 02:16:55,050
It’s quite far off, Sir

1623
02:16:55,260 --> 02:16:57,470
Inside old St. Paul’s church Cemetery

1624
02:16:57,760 --> 02:17:01,600
Even if you say it’s in Karachi,
I am ready to come

1625
02:17:05,260 --> 02:17:07,640
Annie and son have gone home, haven’t they?

1626
02:17:08,550 --> 02:17:09,970
I met them on the way

1627
02:17:10,470 --> 02:17:13,470
I told them not to travel alone during night hours

1628
02:17:15,180 --> 02:17:16,470
And sent my person also with them

1629
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:17,390
What do you say?

1630
02:17:17,550 --> 02:17:19,140
Let’s move, Sir

1631
02:17:20,970 --> 02:17:23,220
Mani, you lead us

1632
02:17:23,430 --> 02:17:25,390
I will follow you with him

1633
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:36,640
Sir, I will change and come

1634
02:18:45,140 --> 02:18:49,350
Are these your father’s earnings
to scoop away alone?

1635
02:19:47,470 --> 02:19:49,640
Padmanabhan Sir and Solomon
will be reaching here any moment

1636
02:19:52,720 --> 02:19:56,470
Better leave both of you,
that will be good for you

1637
02:19:57,100 --> 02:19:58,930
We came here at the behest of Padmanabhan

1638
02:19:59,470 --> 02:20:00,760
Tell Solomon

1639
02:21:00,350 --> 02:21:01,300
What happened?

1640
02:21:01,470 --> 02:21:02,300
Who came here? Speak up

1641
02:21:02,470 --> 02:21:04,180
They ran away with the cash

1642
02:21:04,890 --> 02:21:05,890
Who?

1643
02:21:06,300 --> 02:21:08,050
Didn’t you send those two guys?

1644
02:21:08,550 --> 02:21:11,890
It’s them only..They took the cash

1645
02:21:31,930 --> 02:21:38,470
During some particular moments in life,
I folded and tucked in my dhoti like this

1646
02:21:39,390 --> 02:21:42,600
When I was denied a Seat at the age of 33

1647
02:21:42,890 --> 02:21:46,350
I walked inside the party office
tucking in my dhoti

1648
02:21:47,390 --> 02:21:49,300
When I was accused of taking bribe

1649
02:21:49,470 --> 02:21:55,050
By the Media, Politicians and others,
I walked like this only

1650
02:21:55,680 --> 02:22:00,550
Ultimately, when Police entered my home with Court order
saying all the evidences were against me

1651
02:22:00,760 --> 02:22:03,350
I walked with my dhoti tucked in only

1652
02:22:03,510 --> 02:22:06,180
I didn’t faint

1653
02:22:06,390 --> 02:22:09,350
Nor was I hospitalized with any chest pain

1654
02:22:09,890 --> 02:22:13,300
I was sleeping on the bare floor,
Solomon…bare

1655
02:22:14,930 --> 02:22:19,140
Later, I had walked like this through
the Verandah of the Central Jail

1656
02:22:19,350 --> 02:22:23,180
Finally, I am standing in front of you like this,

1657
02:22:27,550 --> 02:22:28,890
What am I to do now?

1658
02:22:29,300 --> 02:22:32,600
Instead of praising the smartness
of a Paralysed man

1659
02:22:32,890 --> 02:22:34,300
Go and get the money

1660
02:23:03,970 --> 02:23:04,640
Hello,

1661
02:23:05,220 --> 02:23:05,890
Where are you?

1662
02:23:06,140 --> 02:23:06,930
At home

1663
02:23:08,390 --> 02:23:09,180
Is our son asleep?

1664
02:23:09,390 --> 02:23:10,550
He has slept

1665
02:23:11,390 --> 02:23:12,140
What happened?

1666
02:23:19,300 --> 02:23:20,510
You, old mongrel!

1667
02:23:23,220 --> 02:23:25,050
It’s a game of crores!

1668
02:23:26,470 --> 02:23:28,510
I may even pull the trigger against Gods!!

1669
02:23:30,760 --> 02:23:31,760
Presume it like that

1670
02:23:41,100 --> 02:23:45,350
People mostly use knife as a Weapon in our country

1671
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:48,430
But to win this game

1672
02:23:49,550 --> 02:23:50,680
We need a gun

1673
02:23:58,640 --> 02:23:59,550
What is it, Solomon?

1674
02:23:59,970 --> 02:24:01,350
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Yes

1675
02:24:01,970 --> 02:24:02,550
Here

1676
02:24:11,390 --> 02:24:12,760
Those guys fled away with 500 Crores

1677
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:15,470
Padmanabhan had come to meet me

1678
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:17,470
I killed him

1679
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:19,100
What are you talking?

1680
02:24:19,390 --> 02:24:20,390
He is inside the car

1681
02:24:20,930 --> 02:24:21,890
I was forced to kill him

1682
02:24:22,100 --> 02:24:23,050
Please help me

1683
02:24:23,470 --> 02:24:26,300
Only few more years left for my retirement

1684
02:24:26,470 --> 02:24:28,470
Please don’t drag me into such things

1685
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:32,350
Then you arrest me!

1686
02:24:33,220 --> 02:24:34,430
All the evidences are inside

1687
02:24:34,640 --> 02:24:36,180
I am confessing standing right in front of your station

1688
02:24:37,100 --> 02:24:38,600
It’s not here that you should confess

1689
02:24:38,890 --> 02:24:40,720
When he was lying paralysed in the Government Hospital

1690
02:24:41,010 --> 02:24:42,140
You should’ve thought about it

1691
02:24:47,890 --> 02:24:49,600
Then arrest me if you can

1692
02:24:50,100 --> 02:24:52,140
Solomon, I spoke out of fear

1693
02:24:52,760 --> 02:24:54,140
This case will not solve

1694
02:24:54,390 --> 02:24:55,930
None of us can escape

1695
02:25:00,140 --> 02:25:02,890
Technically, Padmanabhan Nair is still in jail

1696
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:07,430
If Nair is not found there,
Superintendent will hold the responsibility

1697
02:25:07,640 --> 02:25:10,430
Two brats have fled away with my 500 crores

1698
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:11,890
What am I supposed to do now?

1699
02:25:12,100 --> 02:25:13,510
I want to retrieve that Money

1700
02:25:14,100 --> 02:25:15,510
The longer we delay, the greater the risk is!

1701
02:25:16,180 --> 02:25:17,930
For that you got to sell this body to him

1702
02:25:19,010 --> 02:25:21,760
Catch them wherever they are

1703
02:25:22,100 --> 02:25:24,890
And put the murder blame on them

1704
02:25:26,100 --> 02:25:27,760
It’s unaccounted money

1705
02:25:28,300 --> 02:25:31,470
If any senior officer finds it,
everything will go down the drains

1706
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:38,430
A game of 500 Crores!

1707
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:43,300
If needed, I would even buy the law of this State

1708
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:55,300
Henceforth it’s your turn to call

1709
02:25:56,550 --> 02:25:57,510
And I will come

1710
02:26:09,470 --> 02:26:10,890
Sir is not picking up

1711
02:26:11,350 --> 02:26:12,680
May be their discussion is still not over

1712
02:26:13,010 --> 02:26:15,390
Had he directed us where to take this money,

1713
02:26:21,470 --> 02:26:23,350
Do you have any tension, dude?

1714
02:26:23,550 --> 02:26:24,390
Solomon…

1715
02:26:26,890 --> 02:26:29,470
like an unleashed dog

1716
02:26:30,510 --> 02:26:31,680
He must be looking for us

1717
02:26:44,140 --> 02:26:45,470
What brings you come in these wee hours?

1718
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:46,680
I am on duty

1719
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:50,470
Someone killed Padmanabhan Sir

1720
02:26:54,890 --> 02:26:56,220
I am just returning from the spot

1721
02:26:58,890 --> 02:27:00,350
Where are Stalin and Majeed?

1722
02:27:03,470 --> 02:27:04,140
Why?

1723
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:05,970
I suspect them

1724
02:27:09,010 --> 02:27:09,930
Where is Solomon?

1725
02:27:10,390 --> 02:27:11,220
I don’t know

1726
02:27:13,300 --> 02:27:14,010
Please come

1727
02:27:18,300 --> 02:27:20,300
Sir is accusing you for killing Padmanabhan Sir

1728
02:27:20,470 --> 02:27:22,550
Speak to him

1729
02:27:25,350 --> 02:27:27,600
Potti Sir, is it true?

1730
02:27:30,390 --> 02:27:31,760
What the hell did you think of yourself?

1731
02:27:32,550 --> 02:27:34,100
I came to take you away

1732
02:27:34,300 --> 02:27:36,930
Hello…this is my space

1733
02:27:37,350 --> 02:27:38,550
No Police tricks here

1734
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:40,390
Oh, I see

1735
02:27:45,890 --> 02:27:47,890
You stay here till the case is solved

1736
02:27:48,100 --> 02:27:51,550
How long can you hold
a Police officer on duty here?

1737
02:27:51,890 --> 02:27:52,970
Until we are safe

1738
02:27:53,180 --> 02:27:55,760
Solomon has killed Padmanabhan

1739
02:27:56,550 --> 02:27:58,140
Don’t you guys wish to live?

1740
02:28:05,390 --> 02:28:09,180
Shouldn’t there be a reason for Solomon’s ending?

1741
02:28:11,720 --> 02:28:15,140
For us to lead a peaceful life,
You must do a favour

1742
02:28:15,550 --> 02:28:17,260
Then there won’t be any issues between us

1743
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:19,180
And everything will be as you say

1744
02:28:20,010 --> 02:28:21,010
What do you want?

1745
02:28:21,220 --> 02:28:22,550
You should kill Solomon

1746
02:28:22,890 --> 02:28:23,470
Pardon

1747
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:25,600
Kill Solomon

1748
02:28:25,930 --> 02:28:27,970
Even if you threaten to kill me

1749
02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:29,600
I won’t do that

1750
02:28:29,930 --> 02:28:32,720
I won’t threaten, I will be forced to kill

1751
02:28:34,390 --> 02:28:35,640
Please think about it

1752
02:28:36,100 --> 02:28:39,760
By the time I kill you and Solomon

1753
02:28:40,390 --> 02:28:41,510
It would be dawn

1754
02:28:42,350 --> 02:28:46,760
Rather it would be better
if you kill Solomon and return home by dawn

1755
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:12,100
It’s Solomon…Convey him as I told you

1756
02:29:18,470 --> 02:29:22,640
Soloman, Prathapan has arrested those guys

1757
02:29:23,470 --> 02:29:25,890
And is taking them to the Station by Jeep

1758
02:29:26,300 --> 02:29:27,220
Before they reach the Station,

1759
02:29:27,390 --> 02:29:29,180
We need to know where the money is.

1760
02:29:53,550 --> 02:29:55,890
Sir, everything is set as directed

1761
02:29:57,550 --> 02:29:59,430
- Ok Sir.
- Ok.

1762
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:07,300
He called to tell me about Solomon

1763
02:30:07,470 --> 02:30:08,180
Is he dead?

1764
02:30:08,390 --> 02:30:08,970
Hmm

1765
02:30:09,180 --> 02:30:10,390
Can we trust him?

1766
02:30:11,890 --> 02:30:15,510
Unless and until we see Solomon’s body,
we will not believe it

1767
02:30:15,720 --> 02:30:18,100
Then you go and check,
I will wait here

1768
02:30:18,390 --> 02:30:21,760
By the time we return,
you must not be seen here

1769
02:30:22,550 --> 02:30:25,970
And don’t make us visit your home,
Mind you

1770
02:30:26,180 --> 02:30:27,010
Get me

1771
02:30:28,220 --> 02:30:32,180
You can decide how to prepare the
FIR of Padmanabhan’s Sir Murder case

1772
02:30:33,510 --> 02:30:38,470
And don’t forget it was you
who called Solomon and killed him

1773
02:31:37,930 --> 02:31:39,550
Have come to kill Solomon?

1774
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:44,720
I am still living only for that

1775
02:31:46,550 --> 02:31:48,300
When this Stalin john became half paralysed

1776
02:31:48,470 --> 02:31:51,300
You thought that I lost my manliness too!

1777
02:31:51,470 --> 02:31:52,890
That was your mistake.

1778
02:31:53,550 --> 02:31:55,970
Moreover I assaulted you at your house, isn’t it?

1779
02:31:57,100 --> 02:32:02,010
Even otherwise I never expected you guys over here

1780
02:32:02,550 --> 02:32:06,180
Hereafter nothing will be as you imagined, Solomon

1781
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:08,760
I must kill you

1782
02:32:08,890 --> 02:32:11,260
Until I don’t kill you,
I know I can't touch him

1783
02:32:13,390 --> 02:32:17,390
I don’t believe there is any greater
inspiration than one’s Ego in this World

1784
02:32:18,100 --> 02:32:19,760
When you enquired about me in my town

1785
02:32:20,300 --> 02:32:22,180
You asked who I am

1786
02:32:23,140 --> 02:32:25,140
But you didn’t ask who I was.

1787
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:08,300
Padmanabhan’s Sir’s car was caught
while checking CCTV Visuals at bypass

1788
02:33:08,510 --> 02:33:11,050
We are checking the rest of the Cameras, Over

1789
02:33:11,300 --> 02:33:12,640
Has the body moved from the spot?

1790
02:33:13,140 --> 02:33:13,760
Yes Sir

1791
02:33:14,300 --> 02:33:16,760
- I will prepare Padmanabhan’s FIR
- Okay sir

1792
02:33:39,300 --> 02:33:41,220
Out of 500 Crores, I have some amount left with me.

1793
02:33:41,390 --> 02:33:43,430
That is my business, Man

1794
02:33:45,180 --> 02:33:49,010
But I need to ask someone

1795
02:33:51,890 --> 02:33:53,260
If it’s Solomon, then you needn’t

1796
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:54,890
We finished him

1797
02:33:58,300 --> 02:34:03,930
It’s not to Solomon but someone else

1798
02:34:14,220 --> 02:34:21,350
Mr.Mohammed Sanafar, this is how I run my business!
