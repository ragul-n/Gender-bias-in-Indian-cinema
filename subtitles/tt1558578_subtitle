so that Bharti story was fake?
only the lover scene was fake

221
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:26,281

00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:48,037
you did lots of things for this country

224
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:52,246
on that time l was not born

225
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:19,364
in 1971 l was in senior KG

226
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:44,391

374
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:08,183

01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:17,118
l want tony khosla's security

382
01:23:26,034 --> 01:23:28,559
he offered me for 10 crores

383
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:31,401
then take it,
we will distribute it

384
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:37,339
how we can kill him?

385
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:53,923
there is a assasin in a near by building
and he is targetting Bachu

386
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:06,773
listen to me

387
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,101

388
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:58,215
Babu ji has set your game

389
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:01,491

01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,516
you are hiding something from me

393
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:36,453
nothing will happen

394
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:42,759
what are you thinking?

395
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:47,635
is it bad to return the lndians money
back to them?

396
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:33,713
whose charge you get?

397
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:37,223
l move with the wind

398
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:55,475
but think if you bring that money back
then what will happen with this country

399
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:17,458
people like you helped them

400
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,595
its notjust the matter of money

401
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:06,005
Babu ji offer was not good

402
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:18,150
and their life will become so small

403
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:32,103
l'm feeling bad that there is nobody
to take care of your dead body

404
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:32,998

01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:04,939
encounter specialist Ranbir Singh is also here

408
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:20,021
there is a shooter who is forcing
him to do that

409
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:22,960
how do you know this?
did you see him?

410
01:33:32,573 --> 01:33:34,165

418
01:36:10,297 --> 01:36:12,458
now there is no gun on you

419
01:36:13,134 --> 01:36:17,195
tiffin has RDX but it dont have
detonater

420
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:20,240

because now l'm going to disconnect
phone

422
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:29,512
always listen to your heart

423
01:38:28,068 --> 01:38:30,002
its not the matter of 500 crores

424
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:48,347
l will transfer that money in government account

425
01:38:48,856 --> 01:38:51,484
they can kill me anytime

426
01:38:51,992 --> 01:38:55,758
if l die then this money will never
come back to lndia

427
01:40:14,742 --> 01:40:17,768
why this work still not finished?

428
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:24,941
as they fire, there will be a riot
in media and public

429
01:43:11,151 --> 01:43:13,585
phone booth lower part is of
bullet proof

430
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:35,654

look at the people

432
01:46:42,696 --> 01:46:46,063

where you were when it was happenning?

434
01:47:10,624 --> 01:47:12,819

435
01:47:14,795 --> 01:47:17,992

436
01:47:18,398 --> 01:47:20,229
and you
were stuck in traffic

437
01:47:51,231 --> 01:47:52,493

438
01:47:53,033 --> 01:47:54,967
that lndia will awake

439
01:48:00,273 --> 01:48:02,639
this is just my first step
