# Hey Chandu #

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
# Every day, Every minute

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
# If we do something today#

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
# Think about the value added because of that#

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
# What are you thinking of achieving in life..
..and how you are going to achieve it #

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
# With clarity....one goal
you should have a proper plan #

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
# Hey!

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
# Life...clarity....

# Why am I so tensed today.. #

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
# I dont understand at all #

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
# Fear?....Or excitement? #

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
# Never in my life I got up so early..
today seems new #

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
# Hey...mom's awake..
so early? #

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
# Looks like she never sleeps #

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
# She might have definitely made kheer #

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
# just like the day I wrote EAMCET..
and the day results were out...hmm..#

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
# Dude...wanna come to the temple?
No ma #

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
# That monkey also might have got up...#

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
# Dad....so early...another lecture? :( #

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
# Chandu...parker pen dude #

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
# My dad gave it to me....
On the FIRST day of my ENGINEERING College #

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
# Its yours....from now on..

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
# Lecture would have been ok...
Sentiment..no no.. #

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
                 Tensed?
Dont worry...everyone will feel the same on the first day 

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If any problem, just go to the principal

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He will take care of everything

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Give her his cell no.dear
   hmm..yeah

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If anyone in college asks, tell them u can sing

30
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,000
# Hello..hello..I lose a lot of hair these days..#

31
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,000
Putting  some oil will be enough na...
instead of being stylish..

32
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,000
Not u ma...I am telling the girl in the radio

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why did u ppl have to come dad?

34
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,000
As if some operation is going on

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
How much more distance will u ppl come??

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Why did mom have to put oil on my hair??

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why did u tell princi that I sing well??

38
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
This is one idiotic radio

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Dad...until now, 147 cars went along this road..
 single driver cars.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That would mean....300 litres of petrol per hr

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Suppose these ppl travel in buses or metros..

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,500
We might save about 10 crores of petrol per yr!
What do u say dad?

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,500
So I guess u will travel by a bus from tomorrow

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Dad..this isnt abt me...just generally

45
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,000
Dad...its a right turn now...

46
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,000
No dear, I guess we need to go straight

00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,000
According to me, every student here....

Excuse me

132
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,000
Whatever a student learns, achieves, loses, gains

133
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,000
This is the beginning for all that

134
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500

Madhu

138
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,700
Mechanical?

139
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
hmm..yeah

140
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,000
Many countries in the world are now depending on India

141
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,000
This is because of you engineers

142
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,000
Why are you so tensed?

143
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,000
Have to sing a song..on stage :(

144
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,000
After his speech...

145
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Oh..

146
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,000
Actually..it seems there is no program after the speech

147
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,000
They will show us the campus itseems

148
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,000

149
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,000

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,000
This is Pandu..my son
he is very shy

154
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,000
I took a lot of care to get him here

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,000

he was a great man

159
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,000
there is a belief in college
that he shows up as a lion to one of them

160
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,000
And that student may be an achiever
You may be one of them

161
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,000
very well sung

162
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,000

245
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,500

00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,900

275
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,000
Whatever be the bad effects of ragging

276
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,000
We became close within 1 hour 

277
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,000
Madhu, Shankar, Rajesh, Appu, Pandu..

and Arjun...i.e. Tyson..

279
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,000
Dont know why..but we suddenly got 
the "friends for life" feeling

280
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,000
Hey ppl...stop there.

281
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,000

00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,000

Whats that mud on you?

293
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,000
He sais he was MLA's son..thats it!

294
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,000
Everyone doesnt have brains like you

295
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,500
Said some senti story when he 
asked you to wear a saree and come

296
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,000
I am not going to leave that fatty,
he is going to suffer

297
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,000
What happened?
Yo u dont want to write?

298
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,000
I got it
If i see its once, thats enough..

299
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,300
I like that boss

300
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,000
Heard that you are hitting on a senior on the first day itself

301
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That was fast

302
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Thats the way he works dear
He'll do it if he likes it

303
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Chandu, you will need to bring him
 to college from tomorrow

304
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,000
Me coming to college daily is impossible

305
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I am sorry, I just helped him..

306
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,000
bringing him to college daily would be diffiult

307
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,000
It'll  already be late when I reach home

308
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,800
Your house is somewhere else
Kukatpally

309
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,000
Hey..I'll write mine..u write yours..ok?

310
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,000
You are asking me why you should help?
Why is he writing notes for you?

311
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,000
Why did you try to stop a senior
 from hitting him just now?

312
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,000
This is called humanity dear

313
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,000
I can see that u  lack in that

314
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,000
Pandu come, lets go
You need not write notes for this guy

315
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,000
Wait..please wait..

316
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,000
Where do you stay in Kukatpally?

317
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,000
Housing board colony :)

318
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,000
Pandu, come

319
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,000
Hey Chandu

320
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,000
You did the right thing.
I liked it

321
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,700
I really like it a lot

322
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,000
Finished the assignment?
Give us the copies..common..

323
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,000
So, finally, our first day of college was over

324
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Was a bit tough..

325
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,700
and a bit funny..

326
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,000
it somehow went by

327
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,000
Ma..

328
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,000
Ma..I need a half-saree..urgent..

329
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,000
Here..I got one

330
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,000
This one? :(

331
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,000
Dont know who asked you to,
but its good to see someone bending u :P

332
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,000
Madhu was fighting with her 8th Class half-saree

333
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Shankar...already started preparing 
as if it were final exams

334
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,000
And rajesh...desperately trying to upset the fatty

335
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,000
And for rajesh's sake..
tyson too is in his own world.

336
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,000
It seems you said there was a rash..

337
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,000
Hey..we know these tricks..

338
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,000
Sorry...er..saree doesnt...

339
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,000
By tomorrow morning, you should 
wash them and press them

340
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,000
Appu understood that fooling seniors is risky

341
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,000
Chandu..u only supported him
I know he is like that

342
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,000
College radio right?
Yeaah :


343
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,000
Come lets go..propose your idea

344
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,000
No Chandu..not now
not now please..

345
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,000
Dont be afraid..
I'll be there na

346
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,000
Excuse me...We have..she has an idea

347
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,000
Instead of a notice board,
we can have a college radio

348
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,000
We can play songs, debates...

349
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,000
Hey..get lost from here

350
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,000
Chal, get up!
go!

351
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,000
And this is low cost..and pretty economical
Please give me one chance

352
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,000
Hi

353
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,000

354
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,000
haha...was just waiting for you..

355
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,000
So..how was the idea?

356
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,000
hmm..they actually liked it
but may be next year..

357
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,000
this year...it seems they are building
 a hospital in the neighbouring village

Even though I am a senior, 
U need not wear it for me na

376
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,000
Actually, it was not only you

377
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,000
Two other seniors asked me to do so..

378
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,000
Thats why I wore one

379
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
Oh

00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,000
Why are u in such a hurry?

381
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,000
Dont know how to carry this half-saree

382
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,000
And moreover..that fellow's PITA

383
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,000
He's killing me
Always follows me, everywhere

384
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,000
Or...shall I drop u?

385
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,000
No, thats ok. If he sees us again,
he'll die crying

386
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,000
Hey Madhu

387
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,600
You..are looking really, really beautiful today

388
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,000

Only then, to the class

393
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,000
Madhu?...my sis?

394
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,000
Just shut up and write

395
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,000
Hey Chandu

396
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,000
If you are found close to Madhu again,
I'll kill you

397
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,000
Understood?
I am serious about her, she is mine

398
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,000
I am not joking

399
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,000

Now write

400
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,000

Half-saree effect....or donno why...

406
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,600
That day, i just wanted to be with her

407
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,000
Wanted to talk to her

408
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,500
May be..even wanted to touch her

409
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,500
Lots of feelings..

410
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,000
When I was just wondering how to...

411
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,000
"Announcement for tomorrow's drawing class

412
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,500
Everyone should bring their own drafters..

413
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,000
And everyone should bring their own textbooks"

414
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,000
Hey Madhu

415
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,500

We'll go right now, otherwise that 
half-saree guy will catch us

420
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,000
Ya ya right..

421
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,000
Hey, but its raining

422
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,000
Its ok, come

423
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,000
First time, someone other than my sis
is sitting on my bike

424
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,000
And that too, it was Madhu

425
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,000
And that too, in a half-saree

426
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,000
And that too, it was raining

427
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,000
I think this is LIFE!

428
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,000
Come, have tea and go

429
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,000
My mom is a chai specialist

430
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,000
Forget abot the chai

431
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,000
her mother

432
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,000

433
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,000

434
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,000

435
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,000
Come, I'll show you my room (by Madhu)

436
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,000
And finally...Madhu's room..

437
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,000
Superb!

438
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,000
Donno what..but I just get the feeling that 
this girl is getting too close to me

439
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,000
Hey bro, shall we play carroms?

440
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,000
Body at one place and mind at another

441
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,000
May be this is what it is

442
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,000
Even though its so long since I came here

443
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,000
My mind is still hovering in Madhu's room

444
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,000
Dont know what the hell is going on..

445
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,000
Hi

446
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,000

449
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,000
And also, need to take Snoopy out for a walk

450
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,000
Oh..walking..

451
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,400

452
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,000

00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,000
Ya, but..generally..
I'll walk with you

454
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,000
Ok

455
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,000
Weather is good

456
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,500
Your dress is also good

457
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,000
Nice dog

458
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,000
Hey, whats going on?

459
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,000
Actually, I am feeling bored at home

460
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,000
thats why

461
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,000
But we had a good time right

462
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah

463
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,000
Hey Thank God
that idiot didnt catch us

464
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,000
Still, why is that guy so crazy?

465
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,000
I think he is obsessed

466
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,000
Just the sight of a half-saree,
I think he goes mad

467
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,000
He keeps irritataing me 
checking from top to bottom

468
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,000
May be he thinks...u r really very cute

469
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,000
Anna, one kg flour and 12 eggs

470
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,000
Am I looking so good?

471
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,000
Shall I tell u the truth?

472
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,000
You are just superb!

473
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500

Thanks anna

475
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,000
Such stupid conversations

476
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,000
Such purposeless visits

477
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,000
this is the first time in my life

478
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,000
Or may be...this is not so stupid?

479
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,000
I dont know

480
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,000
Heard that profs in engg colleges are strict

481
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,000
But I never thought they were so strict

482
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500

00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,000

## (Its hot) ##

515
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,000
it was like a movie..

516
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,000
Everyone of us for a minute

517
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,000
were flying to the door of heaven...

518
00:39:59,100 --> 01:19:00,100
And then, the bell rang

519
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,000
Everyone went behind her...
as if they were hypnotized..

520
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,000
But our friend Rajesh...

521
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,000
he went and sat in her Civil Engg class..

522
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,000
And then...

523
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,000
In Electronics class too!

524
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,000
And after that....

525
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,000
Her classes were over

526
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,000
