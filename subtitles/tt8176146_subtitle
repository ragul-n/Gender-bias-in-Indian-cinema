1
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,536
1990... Thirunelveli District.
From a money lending family...

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,996
of Palayamkottai,
is a boy, Rudramurthy...

3
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,180
who didnt want to get married

4
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,640
and boarded the train

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,020
to Chennai.

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,100
In the same year, Babu Jain...

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,930
a boy from Rajasthan, came

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,540
to Chennai with just Rs.10001/-
to become a big financier.

9
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,616
Time will unite people with the
same goal wherever they are.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,880
Time doesn't know whether the
goal is a good or a bad.

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,780
Babu Jain and Rudramurthy are such
people whom the time has united.

12
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,890
Such boys who came together...

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,140
joined the big financier
Motilal Seth in Chennai

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,470
as collection boys.

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,430
After 5 years

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,076
like everyone feels that one has
to go to the next stage in life...

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,100
they too felt so.

18
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,130
They directly go to Motilal Seth

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,536
and ask him to help them start
their own finance company...

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,640
he says no to that and
throws them out of the job.

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,400
Those two, who came out dejected...

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,060
plan properly and kill Motilal
Seth in his own office.

23
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,496
In 1999, by killing the teacher
who taught them the work...

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,280
both of them start their separate
grand Finance Company in Chennai.

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Leaving one's country

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,076
and going abroad for livelihood
are not the only refugees.

27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,496
Leaving one's home town for the
sake of monetary needs...

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,600
and going to the city are
also in a way, refugees.

29
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,246
Hey, I have been telling you for
the past 2 days to sell the bike

30
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,630
but you haven't come and taken it.

31
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,050
I am coming there.
I will come.

32
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,350
You go to the shop.
- Ok.

33
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,036
Sir, the vehicle won't fetch
as per your expectation.

34
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,116
Hey... first take the vehicle
from here and leave.

35
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,746
First we will see what's the buyer's
price and then we will decide.

36
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,286
Sir, that is what even I
was saying since then.

37
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,456
You only wanted Rs.25,000 net.
- Ok...

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,840
don't get angry.
Take it and go.

39
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,310
Hey... hello...

40
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,666
hello... we went to
the shop to see you.

41
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,480
But you weren't there.

42
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,076
Why do you want to see?
- Isn't there a scooty in your shop?

43
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,666
Thought of buying it
once I know its rate.

44
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,610
For whom?
- For her.

45
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,390
She seems to be from a rich family.

46
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,020
She can buy a new one.

47
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,706
No one in her house likes
her riding a scooty.

48
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,570
That is why she is trying
for a second hand.

49
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,100
Hey... don't you know

50
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,230
which bike to take?

51
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,490
Are you new to this
area or new to the job?

52
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,520
Hey... I am asking you.

53
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,860
Area and the job both are new.
- Go.

54
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,639
Hey... what is next?
- Motilal Seth.

55
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,960
It is about that mini van matter.

56
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,980
Ok, you go there and come
directly to Sukumar.

57
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,040
Have you stolen?
- Do I look like that?

58
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,770
He is hitting and you are watching!

59
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,866
Why?
You should have hit.

60
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,050
Is he looking like a humanbeing?
I was dumb founded.

61
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,710
Didn't you understand?
Just go.

62
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,060
Hey... where are you going?

63
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,456
I am going to see the gentleman
who gave that bike to me.

64
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,680
Shall I also come?
- No need.

65
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,286
Hey, anyway you will hit
the man who gave the bike.

66
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,680
I am eager to see that.

67
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,980
Can I come along?

68
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,140
For the attention of U M finance.

69
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,206
Without knowing what sort of finance
is yours, I took loan from you.

70
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,110
I will somehow repay you
by selling the bike.

71
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,111
Hey... now why did you
come along with me?

72
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,590
Bother, owner has gone out.
You please wait for some time.

73
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,210
Look, tell your owner that he
should be here when I come.

74
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,780
I should not take.
Ok?

75
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,286
I came fast knowing
that you would come.

76
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,190
Came quite fast!
Go.

77
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,456
You know that I am coming.
Why did you hit the boy?

78
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,200
What?
Did I hit?

79
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,400
Come.
Ask the boy.

80
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,956
Let him say that I hit him.
I will cut myself.

81
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,650
Hey... did I hit?

82
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,600
Did I hit you?
Did I hit?

83
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,990
Owner, didn't you hear
what the boy says?

84
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,560
Boys won't lie.
Go.

85
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,036
A person from a middle
class family...

86
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,310
goes missing without any reason...

87
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,140
what would we do at the most?

88
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,826
We would complain.
By complaining like that...

89
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,456
and running to and fro
to the station for 2 years...

90
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,000
do you see what is the state of
an ordinary middle class boy?

91
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Sir...
- We are searching, Poovarasan.

92
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,190
We will find him.

93
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,496
You have been saying this
for the past 2 years.

94
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,520
Hey... what were you doing
for the past 2 years?

95
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,140
Brother, I am asking you normally.

96
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,286
What were you doing
for the past 2 years?

97
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,956
I have been driving brother's
call taxi for the past 2 years.

98
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,300
What else do you expect me to do?

99
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,326
Look Poovarasan, I have
already told you clearly.

100
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,666
As regards your brother's
case and your family...

101
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,860
there are no enemies.

102
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,060
How else to find out?

103
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,576
Someone who is not connected at all
only must have done something.

104
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,180
Sir, don't just say someone.

105
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
Tell me who he is.

106
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,220
What will you do, if I tell you?

107
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,350
Will you kill him?

108
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,996
If I come to know as to who
he is, the pain will reduce.

109
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,456
Is that all?
You are asking too many questions.

110
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,600
I didn't ask questions, sir.

111
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,076
I just asked about
my brother's case.

112
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,060
It would take 5 years to find
out even big people's case.

113
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,850
You don't even have a background!

114
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,366
Your case is almost
like unclaimed body.

115
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,710
We will just bury and keep going.

116
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,206
Understood?
- Sir, if someone dies in your family

117
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,616
or goes missing, will
you talk like this?

118
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,180
Hey... don't be too good!

119
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,576
You won't be able to live.
- I am not a good person, sir.

120
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,786
I am searching for a
chance to make a mistake.

121
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,410
Otherwise why would I come to you
for the past 2 years and ask.

122
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,850
Greetings!
- Greetings!

123
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,980
Greetings.

124
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,786
Greetings Kadiresan.
- Come.

125
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,810
Yes Vadivu

126
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,916
Brother wished to be a member of
your party and so I brought him.

127
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,940
It is good, Vadivu.

128
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,100
We can make him a member.

129
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,610
Brother, give Rs.300.

130
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,480
Give.
- Fill this also.

131
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,270
Hope he knows to write.

132
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,930
Brother, I have a problem.

133
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,666
You tell me that you can solve it.
Then I will pay the money.

134
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,860
Vadivu, take him aside.
He will talk.

135
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,820
Is it?
Ok, come.

136
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,020
Go.

137
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,206
Poovarasan, you should
be patient there, ok?

138
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,230
Come.

139
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,536
Greetings, brother.
- Greetings.

140
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
Greetings.

141
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,956
He is my brother, he is our boy.
Let him in.

142
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,300
What Vadivu, what is the problem?

143
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,760
Brother, his name is Poovarasan.

144
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,326
Sir, brother went missing
2 years back.

145
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,706
You need not find him... just want
to know if he is alive or not.

146
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,610
Can you do it?
- Which place do you belong to?

147
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,260
You are asking if it is possible?

148
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,666
What Vadivu, won't you tell
him before you bring him?

149
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,860
No, I did tell him.

150
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,560
Still he wanted to see
you in person and talk.

151
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,660
Here there are different procedures
to move each and every case.

152
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,866
You don't know if your brother
went missing or died, isn't it?

153
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,140
Hey Kadiresa...
- Brother...

154
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,996
Take him and tell him
about the amount.

155
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,560
Go.
- Come.

156
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,110
Vadivu, is he from our ward?

157
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,020
He is from our ward.

158
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,666
We are using him for
some urgent work.

159
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,980
He is little wealthy.

160
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,640
Ok, then go and see.
- Ok.

161
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,956
Your name?
- Poovarasan.

162
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,280
What 'belt'?
Hey what is this?♪♪♪♪

163
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,496
I asked your name and you said.
This is also like that.

164
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,390
Tell... what 'belt'?

165
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,520
Leather belt.

166
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Whom have you brought!

167
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,770
Hey... Poovarasan...

168
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,630
you should not go away like this.

169
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,866
If boss comes to
know it will be bad.

170
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,680
Come in.
- No.

171
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,036
Come, let us talk.
- This won't work.

172
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,576
If they ask about caste
you should have told.

173
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,960
Hey... what do you want me to say?

174
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,826
You said he would
come running to help.

175
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,496
I don't find any difference
between police and him.

176
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,320
Listen to me.
- No.

177
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,850
Nothing will happen.

178
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,900
That too if it is for
me, nothing will work.

179
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,020
Move.

180
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,496
What happened?
Asked to settle Rs.25 lakhs

181
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,326
you say you are not in the area and
ask them to come here and there

182
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,350
and make them run around.

183
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,850
If you come, I will kill you.

184
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,560
Don't do anything outside.

185
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,246
Brother is not making
money these days.

186
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,826
Brother is not making money.
So I am making.

187
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,036
You will just go in a Scorpio with
a flag in the front with pride.

188
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,866
One day or the other
you will be caught.

189
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,060
I wanted to insult you.

190
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Now aren't you caught.

191
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,540
Nepoleon... you are
making a mistake.

192
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,220
Now what do you want?

193
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,666
You want the money given
by Rudran, isn't it?

194
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,970
You are getting beaten for that.

195
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,360
Go... run and get it.

196
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,610
Hey... Sukumar... didn't you hear?

197
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,320
I asked you to run.
Go... run.

198
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,536
You had it and
should have given it.

199
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,760
Why do you make me run around?

200
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,490
Go.
- You leave.

201
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,100
Hey... I am asking you to go.

202
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,536
This is U M Group.
Now it will not prosper at all.

203
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,360
I have to go to another
party, immediately.

204
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,640
Brother, SI and Hriday have come.

205
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,020
They are waiting for you.

206
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,456
What about Sukumar?
Did the amount come?

207
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,880
It has come.
- Did you insult him?

208
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,310
Yes.
- Did everyone laugh?

209
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,430
No.
They all felt happy!

210
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,116
You talk and see... if it
doesn't work out then kill him.

211
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,380
If you miss then I am finished.

212
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,036
Greetings, sir.
- What does he say?

213
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,416
He says it was taken by his
father and why should he pay?

214
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,866
Is he married?
- No.

215
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,210
But there is a girl in his house.

216
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,720
Then kidnap her.
- Brother...

217
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,600
he is not that attached to her.

218
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
We will make it happen.

219
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,821
Brother... Madhiazagan
has changed the gun.

220
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,560
Hey... get up.
Get up.

221
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,560
Sir is asking you to come in.

222
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,360
Your father pledged the house you
are staying in, for Rs.40 lakhs.

223
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,310
Sorry, your father is no more.

224
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,076
What shall we do?
Tell.

225
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,416
Do you have any slip
that you have given Rs.40 lakhs?

226
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,680
Now the property is in my name.

227
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,580
If you show me a proof that you
have given, I will give it.

228
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,326
Madhiazhagan...
- Sir...

229
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,720
the boy is asking for proof!

230
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,600
Sir, you do something.

231
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,450
I have told him but
he doesn't listen.

232
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,990
Don't you know that you shouldn't
have anything when you come in?

233
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,206
Now the boys are
going to molest her.

234
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,230
You call me and cheat me?

235
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,206
I won't leave you without killing.
You do anything.

236
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,910
But you can't take the
property from me.

237
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,690
Shut up.

238
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,140
Give it.

239
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,560
Arunachalam...
- Sign.

240
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,190
Sign.

241
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,020
The girl is crying.
Sign.

242
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,100
Sign.

243
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,730
Madhiazagan...

244
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,850
Don't be selfish.

245
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,496
The proof is ready.
Take him.

246
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,076
I am asking you to leave.
Go.

247
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,680
Hey... why did you
give him a loaded gun?

248
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,390
No sir... for safety sake...

249
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,030
For whose safety?

250
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,890
Go.

251
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,980
Get out.

252
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,060
Thanks.

253
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,070
You don't like him.
In fact don't like him at all.

254
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
But he is earning well.

255
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,690
Hey... even now I like only you.

256
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,350
Hey... go.

257
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,440
I will call you whenever
I remember you.

258
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,230
You talk.
- No need.

259
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,916
Atleast from now
don't betray anyone.

260
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,340
Who?
Me?

261
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,826
You refuse to go and take
any job when I ask you to.

262
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,640
Hey... that is the limit.

263
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,980
Everything is finished.

264
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,810
Nothing is over.

265
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,366
Even now you say that you
will leave it and come...

266
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,390
I will stay with you.

267
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,200
For me, he is more
important than you.

268
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,166
He is the one who is feeding me
ever since I came to Chennai.

269
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,310
I can't come just like that.

270
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,180
That I already know.

271
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,560
But I was scared that
I will spend

272
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,430
my whole life here, giving
away old clothes.

273
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,600
That is why I agreed
when my family asked me.

274
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,720
Hey... will you kiss me once?

275
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,270
Like the way you would.

276
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,980
Enough!

277
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,420
Whenever you feel that I will
be horrible without you...

278
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,980
you call me.

279
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:04,350
Take.
- Mother...

280
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,036
suppose he comes here, he
shouldn't come here again...

281
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,060
shouldn't call me...

282
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,166
shouldn't follow me... tell him
that I said this in anger.

283
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,750
Ok?
- Take...

284
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,140
'is it a dream of love'

285
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,230
A special ring tone for him!

286
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,456
Hey Mridula...
- Why are you wasting the diesel?

287
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,166
I came to see you.
I should get angry.

288
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,246
Why aren't you answering my phone?

289
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,576
Who should pay rent
for whose house?

290
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,496
Who should pay the dues
for whose vehicle?

291
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,366
You can't come at the
correct time when called.

292
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,916
If I come late by 10 minutes, you
can't talk nicely, isn't it?

293
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,860
Look, we are not yet married.

294
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,116
It won't be good if you stand
here on the road and argue.

295
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,100
Ok?
You go.

296
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,190
I have to go to the school.

297
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,190
Madam...

298
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,076
They wll come home for
verification in 2 days.

299
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,076
Ok, madam.
- They will call before coming.

300
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,076
When should I come?
- It will come home.

301
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Ok, madam.

302
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,166
What is your name?
- Anita, madam.

303
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,310
Original certificate, madam.

304
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,616
Hi!
- Hi!

305
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,640
Did you come to renew?

306
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,560
No, I am applying only now.

307
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,050
I think there is some
connection between you and me!

308
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,019
Take.
- No chance at all.

309
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,019
How do you say?
- Please wait.

310
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,866
Thank you... when we meet
some people in our life...

311
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,890
it feels like that.

312
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,080
The boys won't feel
like that isn't it?

313
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,980
Hey... actually what are you doing?

314
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,770
I... I desired to
go round the world.

315
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,151
It is 10 years since I
took this passport.

316
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,440
So far I have not used it.

317
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,036
Then surely there is some
connection between you and me.

318
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,700
How?
- You wished to go round the world.

319
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,220
I wished to go round my own town.

320
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,270
Then why did you come here?

321
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,576
You should have
stayed there itself.

322
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,361
I need money isn't it?
That is why I came.

323
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,560
But here too I couldn't
lead a life that I wished.

324
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,090
What to do?
We are middle class!

325
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,366
We should never lead
a life we wished.

326
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,560
That is called middle class!

327
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,620
Brother, haven't you applied?
Leave.

328
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,020
See, we couldn't even talk.

329
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,930
Meera, come.

330
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,350
Are you happy?

331
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,880
Give me the 10th mark sheet.
- It is there in that, madam.

332
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,240
For whom are you waiting?
Is anyone coming?

333
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,036
A girl from Palayamkottai has
come to the passport office.

334
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,060
I am waiting for her.

335
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,440
Have you travelled with girls?

336
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,920
No.
- Why?

337
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,390
I have not yet met a
girl whom I liked.

338
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,730
I have met just now.

339
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,230
Have you ever travelled with boys?

340
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,310
Yes, I have.

341
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,410
But there is no one
whom I can remember.

342
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:09,850
Oh... are you ok if some boy
from your town loves you?

343
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,530
I won't like if they love,
but I like my town boys.

344
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Yes...!

345
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,550
Tell me uncle.
- Look at this...

346
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,286
how many years have gone by?
Can you be like this?

347
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:06,110
Tell... can you stay like this
without getting married for 10 years?

348
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,060
'for you'

349
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,366
It is not like that uncle.
Even we are searching.

350
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,996
You say the same
thing whenever asked.

351
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,616
We are doing whatever
is possible, uncle.

352
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,180
You are doing.
We are also watching.

353
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,116
After making all the
conveniences...

354
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,366
he has handed over
the car and gone.

355
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,790
You people are also living happily.

356
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,060
Father, don't talk unnecessarily.

357
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,470
Is he destined to drive this car?

358
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,980
Just enquire and keep quiet.

359
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,206
Sister in law, he is
talking in anger...

360
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,036
you don't get angry.
- You keep quiet Poovarasan.

361
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,496
He is your brother and
he is my husband.

362
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,246
Why should he show
more concern than us?

363
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,270
You go.

364
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Go father.

365
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,616
Do you know why phone
was discovered?

366
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,036
There is problem at home.
That is why I didn't reply.

367
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,326
Now I have come.
Come.

368
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,640
First, are you true to anyone?

369
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,210
I am not true to anyone.
Will you come and sit in the car?

370
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,640
Hey... Mridula...

371
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,810
hey... shouldn't I
talk to you jokingly?

372
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,206
Why joke?
I called you and you didn't answer.

373
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,590
You should ask as to why I called.

374
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,456
Don't get angry.
Now I am asking.

375
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,070
Why did you call?

376
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,100
That party man called you again.

377
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,900
You didn't reply.

378
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,140
Why did he call?

379
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,366
Our car which was standing when
brother went missing...

380
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,350
today an accident took
place in that same spot.

381
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,996
Who are you?
Is it your relative?

382
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,660
Then why are you standing?
Come on, go.

383
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,801
Hey I am asking you to go.
Go.

384
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,360
Greetings to everyone.

385
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
They start a group...

386
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,440
10 of you will join that.

387
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,430
In few days ten of you will fight.

388
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,326
Isn't a problem created
in the family?

389
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,770
All that is not there here.

390
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,389
We give separately for
each and everyone.

391
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,020
Understood?

392
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:00,980
Didn't understand.

393
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,270
Now think that I form a group.

394
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,826
You can come personally
to me whenever you want.

395
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,020
This branch is mine.

396
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,970
I am going to take care of it.

397
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,350
This branch...

398
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,416
If I say this branch is mine
doesn't mean it is fully mine.

399
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,826
We will do only that which
Rudramurthy sir says.

400
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,496
Rudran... the boy Hridayan from
whom you took the signature...

401
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,270
I think he has gone to Babu Jain.

402
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,076
Now the case has gone
beyond Nolambur station

403
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,496
and has gone to
commissioner's office.

404
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,890
Do something good for him.

405
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,940
I have just done it Karuppaiya.

406
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,916
What else?
- What else...?

407
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,826
I am planning to keep 3 kg.
Gold in Babu Jain's locker.

408
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,746
Do you want to say something?
- Now I am in a meeting DC.

409
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,570
Oh is it so?
Good!

410
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,060
Idiot.

411
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,536
Didn't I ask you not to cross
me and go... did you listen?

412
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,746
Quietly go and
fall at that man's feet.

413
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,956
Otherwise for her it
was Ambattur Bridge...

414
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,340
don't know what Bridge is for you.

415
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,640
What is it Madhi...

416
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,326
Are the ones, who did
the accident, new boys?

417
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:55,850
Why?

418
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,706
They have taken the car
over the leg, sir.

419
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,036
What are you saying?
- Tell your boys, sir.

420
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,430
That doctor will torture me.

421
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,270
Sir, what about the interest?

422
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,350
It is nothing much.

423
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,666
How do you pay when
you are in a group?

424
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,030
If I borrow Rs.50,000

425
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,020
I will pay Rs.6,500 per month.

426
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,666
It will get over in 10 months.

427
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,530
Yes, it is the same here also.

428
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
If you pay for 10 months there...

429
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,786
here you are going to pay
for 15 months, that's all.

430
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,519
50,000...?
- Yes, 50,000.

431
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
Then what?

432
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,110
Will you give whenever we ask?

433
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,520
Yes, you will call at midnight...

434
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,116
do I have to come here
and sleep at night?

435
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,430
10 to 6 that's all.

436
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,480
Where is Napoleon?

437
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,890
Brother Madhi had called.

438
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,916
He has gone to give money
to mortuary doctor.

439
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,070
It is a mistake.
What have you done?

440
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,246
You carry a girl...
'eat' extremely!

441
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,390
I am not saying it is wrong.

442
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,760
Because I am not in a stage
where I can justify things.

443
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,166
But eating like this and
throwing it on the road...

444
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,950
they will identify whether 2 wheeler
or a car or a lorry went over.

445
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,230
It is shameful!

446
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,610
No...
- If Robert was around...

447
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,470
he would have done it sharply!

448
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,270
No one is like him.

449
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,410
It seems a new person
has to be created!

450
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,140
Is there any problem here?

451
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,616
You left the function
half way through.

452
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,480
There is no problem here.
You are a problem.

453
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,270
You joined me 8 years ago.

454
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,410
I thought you would
be the same even now.

455
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,036
The heart didn't ache
but you hurt me.

456
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,500
I...?
No.

457
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,770
No Rudran... it is not so.

458
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,210
Hey... what did you tell brother?

459
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,060
You had only said.
My branch...

460
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,680
it is me... it is
wrong Arunachalam.

461
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,360
I didn't mean it that way, Rudran.

462
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,390
Arunachalam, you and I
don't have blood relations.

463
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,060
There is no need for that here.

464
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,536
What is this Rudran, you are talking
as if you are talking to the boys?

465
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:00,390
Hey... as per me all
of you are boys.

466
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,140
You go, I will get it.

467
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,666
Didn't I say while coming in, that
we have to buy you also a dress?

468
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,616
For that, even you have
to open your purse a bit.

469
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,640
Come.

470
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,140
Take this.
- Shall we leave?

471
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
Ok grandfather.

472
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,890
Madam 950.

473
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,496
Is this the way you
search your brother?

474
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,680
Who asked him to buy the car?

475
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,286
Wasn't he going around
carrying medicines?

476
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,246
He could have settled
in a medical shop.

477
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,996
If only you have earned Rs.10,000
per month and given it to us

478
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,036
he too would have settled down
by opening a medical shop.

479
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,420
So I am responsible for that also?

480
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,060
Yes, you are the reason.
Who else?

481
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,456
Now if I find him and make him stand
before you, it is ok isn't it?

482
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,780
You... will find!

483
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,190
If you find him... I will die.

484
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,956
Hey... you bring my son and make
him stand in front of me...

485
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,320
I will commit suicide.

486
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,166
So you think I have not
done anything till now.

487
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,400
Here... you are doing!

488
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,680
I am watching!

489
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,410
Who says that you are
not doing anything?

490
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,100
You take her and go.

491
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,350
Come.

492
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,180
Listen, you go to your house.

493
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,706
I will ask my mother to come
and talk to your father.

494
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,076
Everything will be fine,
if your brother comes.

495
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,166
Who he?
Hope he doesn't come.

496
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,690
He likes if I am troubled.

497
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,140
That is why he ran away.

498
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,610
Now will you go home or not?
- Aunty, sorry aunty.

499
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,930
I had only cried.

500
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,746
How do you know that
I am your aunt?

501
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:59,560
My uncle would show your photo on
the phone and say you are my aunt.

502
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,850
I know that Poovarasan is in love.

503
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,400
Sister in law...

504
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:10,130
But didn't know that he would
be caught by his father.

505
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,270
What are you doing?
- I am working in a school.

506
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,400
It is ok even if Poovarasan
doesn't earn money.

507
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,290
But don't ask him
to drive call taxi.

508
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,770
Uncle...

509
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:49,850
Hey... go.

510
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,326
Father, daughter in law
is not feeding properly.

511
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,470
She feeds well.

512
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,520
She is feeding you first
and you eat happily.

513
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
Ok, bye.

514
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,680
Hey... give me money.
- I have kept it inside.

515
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,800
Don't lie.
- You won't listen.

516
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,480
Hey, father need not know.

517
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,060
Listen...

518
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,980
What does the baby say?

519
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,850
Bye...!

520
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:39,270
He took the car happily
like this for work...

521
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:42,850
it has been 2 years...
he has not returned at all.

522
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,746
We molest a girl courageously.
Do we leave at that...?

523
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:53,810
We destroy his family.

524
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,116
Isn't he the affected party.

525
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,286
How much anger he should get?

526
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,116
It is ok even if there
is no reaction.

527
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,420
He comes and works with us only.

528
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,200
Hridaya, why do you
come inside this?

529
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,770
Do you have any other plan?

530
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
Everything is over.

531
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,956
What else?
- It is their daughter's wedding...

532
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,320
Greetings, sir.

533
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,456
She found it difficult
to get Rs.5 lakhs.

534
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
That is why I came.

535
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,180
Are you her mediator?
- No.

536
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,320
I tried everywhere, sir.

537
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,786
Everyone is saying that
there is no income in IT...

538
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,020
no one is giving money.

539
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,470
You have to do a favour.

540
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:33,060
Hey... Arunachalam, give.

541
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:35,690
What else do you expect?

542
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,810
5 L?
- Tell... I will do.

543
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,850
Nothing.

544
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,706
One hour before tying the
nuptial chain you have to pay.

545
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,456
We will give, sir...
we will surely give.

546
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,030
Do I have to sign...

547
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,220
My brother has said.

548
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,500
You go.
- Ok.

549
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,826
Don't give trusting me.
Now I don't have any property.

550
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,650
Suppose they don't give,
then what do I do?

551
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:01,220
This is how Robert came saying
that your father needed money.

552
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:05,090
I gave money at this same
place without taking any proof.

553
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,930
Atleast now you understand.

554
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,910
Brother, I feel like
staying with you.

555
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,810
Why?
- I am living alone.

556
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,500
I can live with
someone's background.

557
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,390
Ok.

558
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,220
Hey...
- Go...

559
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,010
Give my document.
Take this.

560
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,536
After giving 15 lakhs, you
are asking for document!

561
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,746
It is my mistake to let
you run this shop.

562
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,570
I run this shop and
give you this 15 lakhs.

563
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,220
Then can I steal and give?

564
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,930
Give me that document.

565
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,430
I will pledge it in a bank
and do full settlement.

566
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,536
Then why did you take
the money from me?

567
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,706
You could have taken it from the
bank at the beginning itself.

568
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,010
At that time there was no IT.
Now we have got it ready.

569
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,570
I think Babu Jain is behind this.

570
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,850
So what if whoever is there?

571
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,390
You have got the money... leave.

572
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,270
You made me come in person.

573
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,980
Napoleon...

574
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:33,890
What...

575
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,576
Now you have to beg
in this same place.

576
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,166
In 10 minutes time you should
have Rs.10 in your plate.

577
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,360
Or else you are gone.

578
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,326
Won't you shout?
Shout...!

579
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,536
Sister, Rudran is creating problem.

580
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
Hey... sit...

581
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,930
Shout... ask them to give you alms.

582
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:54,520
Madam... mother...

583
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,746
Whose car is standing on the right?

584
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,290
Move it.
It is standing on the road.

585
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,910
Why have you got
down and doing this?

586
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,400
Mother... madam...

587
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,690
Hey... what?
- Alms...

588
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:12,810
Go...

589
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,401
I will pay the rent myself.
Leave him sir.

590
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,030
How selfish you are!

591
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,826
Hey umpire, why are
you troubling him?

592
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,246
Why?
Why should I not trouble him?

593
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,970
Why do you bother?
- He desires to live.

594
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:46,390
Come.

595
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:49,956
I won't trouble you.
I will just ask you one question.

596
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,980
You answer only that.

597
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,076
A person is destroying your
property and family itself.

598
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,350
How can you work for him?

599
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,496
You reply only to this.
- Umpire...

600
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,520
I am asking you to come.

601
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,866
How many people are
there in your house.

602
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,050
Mother and myself... why?
- After your mother dies...

603
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,956
if this question is stuck
to you, come and ask.

604
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
I will tell.

605
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,060
Tell.

606
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,916
I asked Arunachalam to
deal this Adi matter.

607
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,150
Has the boy done anything?

608
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,640
Just find out.
- Which boy?

609
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,680
He is that Hridayam.

610
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,610
When will you give?

611
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:43,116
The apartments built in Sengalpattu
has not yet been sold.

612
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,180
What do you want me to do?

613
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,416
Adi, the flat that you
have built is Rs.40 lakhs.

614
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,166
The money that I gave
you is just Rs.4 lakhs.

615
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,706
Is there any connection
between the two?

616
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,826
The money has not come, if it
had come wouldn't I have given?

617
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,666
You say money hasn't come but you've
started the work on new building.

618
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,786
Where did you get money for this?

619
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,116
Hey why do you come
and create a scene?

620
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,746
Father is giving you
interest properly.

621
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:01,390
Only the principle has to be given.

622
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,570
Move... go.

623
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:06,130
Keep quiet, father.
- Listen to me.

624
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:10,220
Hey your father couldn't settle
the money on the said date.

625
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,076
No sir.
- Then the sound will be loud.

626
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,180
You should be silent.
Go.

627
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,640
Father, they are hitting.

628
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,286
Adi, the amount
should come tomorrow.

629
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,786
If not your son will
come home with one hand.

630
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,100
Father...
- Come.

631
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:39,680
Take... settle the hospital
bill with this amount.

632
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,246
I told you that I will sell the
flat and give you the money.

633
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,246
Why did you cut my
son's hand before that?

634
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,706
There is something
called time, Adi.

635
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,780
That is everything for us.

636
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,826
If you had settled the
amount on the said date...

637
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,170
would such a thing have happened?

638
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,640
If we can't do anything to you...
you will do whatever you want?

639
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:01,310
Adi, because you knew that we
will do whatever we want...

640
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,140
you couldn't do anything.

641
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,706
Hey... now what are you
going to do about his hand?

642
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,456
Hey... first settle the
amount that you borrowed!

643
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,880
Then the hand will grow on its own.

644
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,036
Why do you give amount
to these people?

645
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,060
Stop with this.

646
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,190
Ok.

647
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,280
Switch off the mobile
and give the hand bag.

648
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,166
Have you collected from Swami?
- Yes.

649
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,866
Why didn't you collect money last
month from Santhanabharathi?

650
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,536
He has gone to his home town
because his father died.

651
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,841
Collect it before he dies.
Go.

652
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,270
Good morning, sir.

653
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,416
I want to pledge the document.
- Which area?

654
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,746
Anna Nagar.
- Is it for business or for personal?

655
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,290
It is for business.
Please check it.

656
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,880
Come between 1st to 10th.
Go.

657
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
Stop.

658
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
Hey...

659
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:13,850
I have to see him, sir.

660
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,246
He will not see those
who don't pay interest.

661
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:20,430
Napoleon, I have come in dispair.
Don't irritate me.

662
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,230
Go.

663
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,600
He gave because you said.

664
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,780
Tomorrow he will ask me.

665
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,456
Brother, we will go and
hit them and collect.

666
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
Do something.

667
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,519
Napoleon, he had brought a party.
Today is the settlement.

668
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,786
It has not yet come.
Come, let us go.

669
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,810
Wait.

670
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,600
This, I borrowed from you.

671
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:51,190
This, you gave for my
son's hospital expenses.

672
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,810
Rudra...

673
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,206
in everyone's life there would be a
day when they would've got insulted.

674
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,280
That will be through me.

675
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,246
Hit... what are you
talking and to whom?

676
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,270
Hridaya...

677
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,360
Hey... go.

678
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,850
Why did you remain like that?

679
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,166
The one who cut the hand
should catch the neck?

680
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,390
Brother, you have kept people
who are affected by us.

681
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,246
He is doing the things
which I am supposed to do.

682
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,350
Is this a problem for you?

683
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,770
It is not a problem.

684
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:26,850
When you call Hridayan,
it pains within me.

685
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,940
Hey... isn't it her marriage today?

686
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,036
Is this causing more
pain than that?

687
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,560
Brother, you are with me.

688
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,390
Then how will it pain?

689
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,310
Only this pains.

690
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,280
Hey... we are talking.
Go.

691
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,850
Brother, shouldn't there be
a marriage in our life?

692
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,680
Ok, leave me.

693
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,866
I don't want.
But you...?

694
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,286
Don't you need a girl
to look after you?

695
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,430
Why?
Won't you look after?

696
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,310
I will take care of you.

697
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,600
But don't you need a marriage?

698
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,850
Hey... what is there in it?

699
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,416
We ourselves keep a
security for ourselves...

700
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,720
and is it necessary for a
separate person to follow us?

701
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,166
Then do you say that you
don't want to marry at all?

702
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,706
All the relationships
are like use and throw.

703
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,280
Use them so long as they are there.

704
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,030
If not, throw away.

705
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:35,470
Brother, why do you stay alone
without anyone being there for you?

706
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,900
When you are alone when
no one is around...

707
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,150
we have a freedom for ourselves.

708
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:43,810
You feel that.

709
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,350
You are the hero.

710
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,680
So if we do this business...

711
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,116
then we have to see all the
human beings like cattles.

712
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,116
We have to feed them so
long as they are needed.

713
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,666
If we don't need them, we should
cut them and eat and keep going.

714
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,690
Isn't it?

715
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,180
You have said it correctly.

716
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,270
But change it a bit.

717
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,640
Have you noticed one thing?

718
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:06,850
None of these cattles
will see who feeds them.

719
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,970
It will only see what they get.

720
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,830
Because for them
food is the target.

721
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,520
People are also like that.

722
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,130
Even for them food is the target.

723
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,720
So for that they add love,
affection wherever and whenever.

724
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,576
This cattle relationship
is enough for me.

725
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,930
I can't live like you.

726
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,110
Why?
- Because I am not a cattle.

727
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,220
For me the person who feeds and
what he feeds both are important.

728
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,190
Bye.

729
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,246
All the relationships
are like use and throw.

730
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,810
Use so long as they are there.

731
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,550
If they are not there, throw away.

732
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,536
Hey... how many times
have I told you...

733
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,746
not to dress up the way I
like in the morning itself.

734
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,666
All the things that are not
used will become old...

735
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,250
and one won't like to look at it,
is what my grandmother said.

736
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,160
Why are you with me?
- I think I like you.

737
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,036
For how many days
will you be with me?

738
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,770
Till you get bored.

739
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,440
I am feeling bored now itself.

740
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,220
What will you do?
- Then I will have to go.

741
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:52,350
Leave.
- Don't get angry.

742
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:06,670
He will come to me and plead.
You don't take pity on him.

743
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:07,730
Tell mother.

744
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,076
You would always deposit
money on the 1st itself.

745
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,100
Have you forgotten?

746
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,600
No, the money is in my hand.

747
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,616
I will put it in the
account and tell you.

748
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,640
Go and take.

749
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,180
Ok, be careful.

750
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,110
Sir, wait for an hour

751
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,206
after the nuptial chain is
tied I will get gift money

752
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:25,980
and I will return the money.

753
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,956
Hey... what did you say
when you borrowed?

754
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,366
Didn't I say you have to
give the money one hour

755
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,616
before tying the nuptial chain?

756
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,036
Even now I am saying
the same thing.

757
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,326
I am asking you to
wait for an hour.

758
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,710
Am I asking you to wait for a day?

759
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,890
You please sit.
Brother...

760
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,980
you please tell him.

761
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,536
While borrowing you forcibly
took me and got the money.

762
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,286
While giving you can give
without insulting me.

763
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:43,310
Go and bring.

764
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:56,770
Sir, wait for a while.
I will arrange and give.

765
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,970
We can talk it out.
Don't.

766
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:02,610
I am telling.
I am saying we will talk it out.

767
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,390
For that you will hit me only?

768
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,206
Hey... we asked you to get
and you are standing!

769
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,950
Hit...
- Napoleon why do you do like this?

770
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,230
He is my man.

771
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,826
Brother, come.
Come.

772
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:23,850
Hey... come.

773
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,326
We are doing this marriage
as she likes him a lot.

774
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:33,890
You don't create any problem.

775
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,970
I know.
I came without realising.

776
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,280
You come and sit.

777
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,246
I will arrange and give.
You take it and go.

778
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,990
Don't.
- Oh come.

779
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,360
Come, come and sit.

780
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:48,770
Come.

781
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,970
Hey... your man has come.

782
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:15,310
'I am not a chaste person'

783
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,780
'I am not the one who
was born for you'

784
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,310
'even if I vanish'

785
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,930
'even if it is the next birth'

786
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,690
'don't go beyond me'

787
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:32,280
'I need you'

788
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,570
'even if I lose I
will be there for you'

789
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:41,780
'even if I am dead or forgotten
I will deny for you'

790
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,890
'even if I am lying down,
don't cross me and go'

791
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,560
'I need you'

792
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,560
'don't go beyond me'

793
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,970
'I need you'

794
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,430
'to talk affectionately and
with love there are no girls'

795
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,680
'everyday we didn't embrace'

796
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,060
'to love with eyes
there is no mercy'

797
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:36,560
'don't have patience to
talk to you and separate'

798
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,600
'follow me, come as a companion'

799
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,150
'to celebrate presumptuously'

800
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,060
'come measured, come contained'

801
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,430
'to stay daily'

802
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,390
'eventhough it is for me'

803
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:53,030
'though you go separate'

804
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:58,430
'we have lost because of
our own self so you and I'

805
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:04,310
'will separate, you were not the
one who had only friendship'

806
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,600
'I am not the one who
was born for you'

807
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:16,030
'even if I vanish or
if it is the new birth'

808
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,770
'don't go beyond me'

809
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:21,350
'I need you'

810
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:58,520
'even I didn't live
with you in dream'

811
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:03,890
'you didn't sleep with me at night'

812
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,916
For me he is more
important than you.

813
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,480
'don't need'

814
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,780
'so did't start a new path'

815
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,730
'to embrace or to forget'

816
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,350
'love's arrow'

817
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,180
'will laugh will get thrilled '

818
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,610
'to unite once again'

819
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:28,600
'if only for this'

820
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,116
What?
- I told you...

821
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,560
that a person loved me one sided.

822
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,260
He is the one.
- Oh is it so?

823
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,720
'you and I'

824
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,350
Uncle that sister is calling you.

825
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,690
'didn't stay with friendship'

826
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:45,890
'I was not...'

827
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,650
In front of a good
person, love is nothing.

828
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,140
'even if I live for you'

829
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,560
'I need you'

830
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,076
Brother, I have given
the amount to uncle...

831
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,100
take it.

832
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,100
Brother...

833
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,440
thank you very much.

834
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,660
This wouldn't have
happened without you.

835
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:28,060
Hey, why did you hit him like this?
Go.

836
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:43,246
That Sukumaran, who
settled our dues...

837
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:46,110
he is again creating
problem with our party.

838
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,600
I think he doesn't know my value.

839
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:50,510
How much we have done for him.

840
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,820
We have to do something very bad.

841
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,116
Brother, let us not do
anything in his area.

842
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,140
We will take him out.

843
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,940
Ok, take the boys.
- Ok.

844
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:08,520
I like him a lot.

845
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,496
Otherwise I am not
over enthusiastic.

846
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,430
I know.
Go.

847
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,310
Hey... catch...
- Tie.

848
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:47,666
Sukumar, such a thing has
happened with many people.

849
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:48,900
I have myself done it for you.

850
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,850
But brother would do it for me...

851
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,980
You didn't expect that brother would
do this for you so soon isn't it?

852
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,770
Planning!

853
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,220
I know.

854
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:11,360
Hey... we all will always
remember where we are.

855
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,730
But we often forget who we are.

856
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:16,076
Henceforth both of
us will remember.

857
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,100
Ok?

858
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:37,270
Hey Hridayam, come and collect him.

859
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:41,190
What Napoleon...

860
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:42,770
is it paining a lot?

861
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,440
Tell brother, that I have
not made any mistake.

862
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,530
You don't have an identity.

863
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,190
You did the finance properly.

864
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:44,970
You were everything to me.

865
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,120
I thought you would be ahead
of me as regards girls.

866
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,770
Hey, you know she is not for you...

867
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,246
then why does she need
a man for herself?

868
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,810
Brother, don't talk
about her like this.

869
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:00,030
Hey... I had planned to help you...

870
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:01,510
and gave her father the money...

871
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,666
but you go there and hit the boys.

872
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:03,730
You have misunderstood me.

873
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,076
You are feeling for the
girl who left you.

874
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,460
What will you do for this Utharan?

875
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:09,390
I will give my life.

876
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:15,350
Hey...

877
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:22,100
what Napoleon... vengence?

878
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,940
If I give you a reason for
this it will not be good.

879
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:27,770
You go.

880
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:33,850
What are you doing?
- He has stuck it with gum.

881
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:36,116
He is true to me and
making mistakes.

882
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,540
You are staying with me and acting?

883
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,520
It is your face.
Can it get scratched?

884
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,640
Hey...
- Don't feel too much, go.

885
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:44,730
Leave me.

886
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:52,400
Atleast now you decide that you
don't need anyone in your life.

887
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:55,270
After that start finance.

888
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,900
What are you saying?
- 50 lakhs Ujwala.

889
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,366
Ambattur branch amount has to be
transferred to Avadi Sukumar.

890
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:12,600
Ok, I will search.

891
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:15,036
Search quickly.
- Is there any problem there?

892
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,380
I had kept it in the locker room.

893
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:18,470
Did anyone come after I left?

894
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,770
No... no one came.

895
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:21,440
Did anyone come in my absence?

896
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,460
Who can come here when
you and I are not there?

897
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,349
Someone would come
in search of you.

898
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,456
What is this you are
talking in a different way.

899
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,480
I am very tensed.

900
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,020
Are you very tensed?

901
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:33,180
Yes.
- Too much?

902
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,230
I am breathless.

903
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,536
You just come out
of that locker room...

904
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,560
and close the eyes.

905
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,950
I have come.
- Lean back.

906
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:44,690
I have leaned.

907
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,890
I got scared.

908
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,230
Now.
- No.

909
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,100
During such times you
should not get scared.

910
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:59,310
Ok, you should also play something.

911
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,020
I will come at night.

912
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,940
I can't.

913
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,270
I need now itself.

914
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,560
Sometimes, for some
things, one has to wait.

915
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,140
That is happiness.

916
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,706
You played because you liked it.
Then what?

917
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:14,730
Come.

918
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,230
Come.
- Utharan asked me to give this.

919
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:40,390
That is why I came.

920
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,916
Otherwise you wouldn't
have come, isn't it?

921
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,320
No, I have never seen
you with Utharan.

922
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:47,051
You are new.
That is why I said like this.

923
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,570
That is Utharan's 'plus'!

924
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:51,456
No one knows who, where and
when someone was with him!

925
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,230
But he will use when it is needed.

926
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,280
You are the only one who
has understood Utharan.

927
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,866
He is a person who is guided
by his own understanding.

928
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,456
When asked or seen he will do what
he feels like and keep moving.

929
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,480
How do you say?

930
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,366
You and I are together
for so many years.

931
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:07,060
Till today, beyond him...

932
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,820
about his family or his background...

933
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,190
do you and I know any details?

934
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,770
We are not UM Finance owners.

935
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,600
We are just like helpers.
That's all.

936
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:19,850
Ok, forget that.

937
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,020
Let us not talk about him.

938
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,430
Shall I do something good for you?

939
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,770
For what?
Because I beat Napoleon?

940
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,310
Why do you see you
and me differently?

941
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,416
If you want to do
something good for me...

942
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,246
see to it that he doesn't
come to the top.

943
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:32,390
Hey... so much has happened.

944
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,780
Will Utharan call him again?

945
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:34,810
He will call.

946
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:35,930
You and I have a problem.

947
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,140
If Utharan decides that he should
not antagonise you and me...

948
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,270
he will surely call him.

949
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,246
How many years have
you been with him?

950
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,560
It has been more than 5 years.

951
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,440
That is why this sole leadership.

952
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,456
Because of that one should not
be with him without knowing him.

953
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,320
Sukumar... are you pin pointing

954
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:55,826
that I am with him for so many years
without knowing anything about him?

955
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:58,180
Because you don't know
anything about him

956
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:00,110
you are with him for so many years.

957
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,100
Go.

958
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:10,350
Greetings, sir.

959
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:25,790
Tell brother Babu that I have come.

960
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,576
Hey first say who you are, from
where have you come...

961
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,560
for what have you come...

962
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,930
tell me everything.

963
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,180
I have to go in and tell.

964
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:33,866
If I tell everything to you...

965
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:35,270
then why should I see Babu Jain?

966
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,440
Go... go and say Napoleon has come.

967
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,630
Sir Napoleon...
- Ask him to come, you go.

968
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:49,730
Ok, sir.

969
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,890
Bala, sir is calling him in.

970
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:54,270
Brother go.

971
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,090
What Napoleon, how is your hand?
- It is ok.

972
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,320
Do you need money?
- No.

973
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,300
Then why have you come this side?

974
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,116
A commercial property
in Anna Nagar area...

975
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,140
worth 1 crore.

976
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:15,090
I have told the party 50 lakhs and
have said they should pay us 5%.

977
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:17,826
You take whatever you want
and give the remaining.

978
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:20,410
You know everything about
our business, Napoleon.

979
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,640
Give me little time.

980
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,540
Why brother Babu?
- You are the life of Utharan.

981
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,850
Nothing should go wrong.

982
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:30,140
Will you chase your boys
away without any reason?

983
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:32,020
I don't have that kind of habit.

984
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:35,366
Without doing a mistake I
will not chase away anyone.

985
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:38,600
Then you say I made a mistake?
- You didn't do a mistake Napoleon.

986
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,650
But it was Utharan who created you.

987
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,706
Tell me if I can pamper you
and take work out of you?

988
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:44,860
You don't have to pamper me.

989
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:46,780
I will get you business.

990
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,116
You do it for me.
- I will think Napoleon.

991
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,970
Will you think or will you
talk to him and tell me?

992
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,380
Why do you have to know all that?

993
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,326
I will finalise it for
you in the next meeting.

994
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,350
Go.

995
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:15,850
Then, how do you wish
to lead your life?

996
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,610
How to lead...

997
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:21,496
for a long time my mother wanted
a concrete house in the village.

998
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,800
I have to build a house for her.

999
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:24,970
I need a small car for me.

1000
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:29,350
Earn well till the age of 40 years
and settle down in the village.

1001
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:30,690
Is that all?

1002
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:33,810
Yes.
- I don't like this love and all.

1003
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:39,520
Not only that I don't have
faith in the marriage.

1004
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:43,530
How to say... I want
to travel for life.

1005
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,480
What about you?

1006
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,980
Hey... it is ok.

1007
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,650
Leave it.
Let's go.

1008
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,610
No.
You go.

1009
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,770
Hey... you drop me.

1010
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,340
Are you trying to irritate me?

1011
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,496
When I came to Chennai
in the beginning...

1012
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,536
I bought an appam and when asked to
pay money for the sambhar separately

1013
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,560
I went to kill him.

1014
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:11,520
I am getting angry...

1015
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,036
I can't be shamless like you.
I will just go and tell.

1016
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,100
Ok.

1017
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:29,270
Has Ramakrishnan taken the Pulsar?

1018
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:31,430
He said he will come
in the evening.

1019
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,180
What?
- Meera says...

1020
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:37,890
that she wants to
top up her mobile.

1021
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:47,220
Brother, top up Rs.300 to Airtel.

1022
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,310
Hey... he has done it!
- Has he?

1023
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,890
It is a mistake.

1024
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,100
Meera says, she wants to go out...

1025
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,890
you have to fill the tank.

1026
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:18,030
Fill the tank.
- Check the zero.

1027
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:21,600
The tank is full.
Go.

1028
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:29,520
Hey... the petrol
tank is already full!

1029
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,680
Hey why didn't you say it earlier?

1030
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:33,890
You didn't ask at all.
- I will hit.

1031
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:40,850
Meera...

1032
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:44,166
Everything was over that day itself.
What else?

1033
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:45,616
You had applied for the
passport, isn't it?

1034
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,100
I came to ask if it had come.

1035
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:48,786
What are you going to
do by knowing that?

1036
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:50,826
No, it is said that if one has
to travel with someone...

1037
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:52,996
one has to know fully
about that person.

1038
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,640
Who said?
- My father.

1039
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:56,666
I had told you that day itself.
Ok?

1040
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:58,616
This travelling...
to be in touch...

1041
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,996
to connect... don't come
to me for all this.

1042
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,666
Will you be married
to me till the end?

1043
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,690
Tell me, why passport, we can
talk about personal life also.

1044
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:07,496
Tell me, can you do it?
You can't, isn't it?

1045
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,036
Come on, go.
Take her away.

1046
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:11,380
Why are you still standing here?
- Hey come.

1047
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,310
Whose daughter are
you trying to hit?

1048
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,560
What are you doing here?

1049
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:20,320
Scooty was on sale and I
came to know its price.

1050
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:22,456
Hey... won't you say
the price when asked?

1051
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,860
That is what I was saying.

1052
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:25,826
How... will you raise your
hand and tell the price?

1053
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:27,866
I have told you not
to ride 2 wheeler.

1054
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:28,956
Then why do you wish to have it.

1055
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,620
Go and sit in the car.
Go.

1056
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,440
Hey... if I see you again
with my daughter...

1057
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:38,290
I will thrash you.
Go.

1058
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:44,956
Which town?
- Playankkottai.

1059
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,150
Is that why you are arrogant?

1060
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:47,810
It is not being arrogant.

1061
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:50,666
They came and asked me
the price of scooty.

1062
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:51,690
I said Rs.20,000.

1063
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:54,970
She said give it for Rs.2,000 or
else she will get the shop shut.

1064
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:08,940
I have to see Hridayam.

1065
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,520
Go.

1066
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,680
Name?
- Vasan.

1067
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,740
Tell the number.
- 989148403.

1068
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,180
Go straight and turn left.

1069
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,260
Hridayam.
- Sit.

1070
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:27,996
Who are you?
What are you doing?

1071
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,810
I have a shop.
- What shop?

1072
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,930
Second hand bike sales.
- Where?

1073
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:33,680
Rajaji Street.

1074
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,416
If it is Rajaji Street then there
is provision store opposite to it.

1075
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,996
Where from the provision store?
- There to the left.

1076
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:40,576
To the left is the fruit shop.
Where is your shop?

1077
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,180
It is directly opposite to it, sir.

1078
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,956
If it is opposite then it
is Pachchayappa store.

1079
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,956
Yes that is the one.
It is that shop.

1080
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:46,980
Ok, give me your license.

1081
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,640
Sign at the right side corner
till the bond paper gets over.

1082
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,826
Hey, have you brought the scooty?

1083
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:00,610
I have come.
Ask him to come.

1084
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,326
It is standing below.
Take it.

1085
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:04,930
Sir, this down payment...

1086
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:07,070
I will come to the shop.
You go.

1087
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:11,550
Does Napoleon have so
much respect here?

1088
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,850
No one has respect here.

1089
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:16,416
Don't you have a shop?
The respect is for your shop, go.

1090
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,520
Ok sir. Bye.

1091
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:33,430
Hey move.

1092
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:36,286
Hey... who is he?
- Pachchayappa has referred him.

1093
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:37,496
Is it so!
- He has a shop in his building.

1094
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,470
Ask him if he knows
to ride the scooty.

1095
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,520
He has fallen down.

1096
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:45,680
Why we have not yet got the
interest amount from Adi?

1097
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:47,730
Adi has joined Babu Jain.
- Is it so?

1098
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:49,360
Yes... didn't we hit him?

1099
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,729
At that time itself Babu
Jain has taken him over.

1100
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,366
What difference does it make
to me who takes over Adi?

1101
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:53,706
Why the amount has not
yet been collected?

1102
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,496
No, wanted to ask you
and then collect.

1103
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,760
Don't get used to give excuses.

1104
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:58,020
You will go missing.

1105
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:02,060
Hridayam, ask Arunachalam
to kill Adi.

1106
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:03,140
Yes, I will tell.

1107
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:07,166
The Airtel number you are calling...

1108
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:08,246
I am giving so many details...

1109
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:09,286
he is getting angry at me.

1110
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:11,286
What is the point in giving details.
You couldn't take the decision.

1111
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:12,510
What decision has to be taken?

1112
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,036
Either you should have killed the
person or collected the amount.

1113
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:16,310
You didn't do either.

1114
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:18,140
My father has no brain.

1115
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:20,059
Why does he take the
new scooty from him?

1116
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,220
That you have to ask him.

1117
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:27,140
Hey... see he has done a 'comedy'.

1118
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:32,560
Stupid.

1119
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:33,940
Key... give the key.

1120
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:35,310
Give.

1121
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:38,860
Hey... don't you have brain?

1122
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:41,246
I have bought a new scooty,
prayed to God and garlanded it...

1123
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:41,930
you are throwing it.

1124
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,110
Hey... what... creating a scene?

1125
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,140
I know what has to be
done to my scooty.

1126
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:48,770
Come, let's go.

1127
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:58,090
You came in search of me to buy
scooty because she is loving you?

1128
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,880
She won't be a good match for you.

1129
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:02,670
Don't waste your time
by running after her.

1130
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,326
Stick a photo behind the vehicle
saying brother is missing...

1131
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:21,350
and write your number.

1132
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,960
Who is there to find out like that?

1133
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,166
Then you won't listen
if I tell you.

1134
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:26,366
Now shall I wipe the car or not?

1135
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:28,930
Hey... if you can't then tell me.
- I can't.

1136
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:30,060
Do whatever you can.

1137
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:32,010
You are here for so many years.

1138
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:33,286
Is there even a single
person here for you?

1139
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:35,366
Hey... is this our town?
- You know, isn't it?

1140
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:36,060
Then we have to keep quiet.

1141
01:06:36,061 --> 01:06:37,746
Then on your own you
won't do anything.

1142
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:40,496
You are saying I don't do anything.
I can do only if I know who it is.

1143
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,560
Why are you killing me?

1144
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:48,560
Sweta... what is this?
- Spider... monkey.

1145
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:50,020
Very good!

1146
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:54,166
From tomorrow, when you
get this, get two more.

1147
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:55,940
Why?
- Tiffin, lunch, dinner.

1148
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,180
Will you come and stay in my house?

1149
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:00,866
Of late no one in my house is
affectionate towards me.

1150
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:01,890
Is there a problem again?

1151
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:09,970
He was driving day and night saying
he has to pay due for the car.

1152
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,600
It seems he would have paid.

1153
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:14,510
I can't drive day and night.

1154
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:18,560
If you want more money than
this, you go and drive.

1155
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:22,440
We behave nicely.

1156
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,800
People do all sorts of things.

1157
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:25,996
Why nothing good is
happening to us?

1158
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,380
It is all the curse of my brother.

1159
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,866
When my brother was here he used to
scold me as I didn't go for work.

1160
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:31,866
I would keep telling
him not to scold me.

1161
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:32,890
He will be shouting.

1162
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:35,496
I will break something
in anger and go away.

1163
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,800
He can't bear even for one hour.

1164
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:39,970
He will call me and ask me where
I am and ask me to come home.

1165
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:41,940
Brother...

1166
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:53,390
Where are you?
- We have crossed Anna Nagar circle.

1167
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,721
Give the phone to the driver.
- One minute.

1168
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:59,230
Brother, he is giving the address.
Will you please note it?

1169
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,980
Sir...
- Take right from the signal.

1170
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:02,940
Ok sir, after that...

1171
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,076
Keep looking to the left,
there will be a road inside.

1172
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,326
You drop her there and keep going.

1173
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:07,350
Sir...

1174
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:09,706
In case you are asked
to pick up again...

1175
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:11,366
tell her that you have a
personal work and keep going.

1176
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:12,790
Truly I have my personal work, sir.

1177
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:20,390
Are you coming or not?
- I am on my way.

1178
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,730
Why do you always make me cry?

1179
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,866
I will be home in 5
minutes, Mridula.

1180
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:26,536
How many 5 minutes,
how many 10 minutes?

1181
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,770
You need not come.
- Can't you wait for 10 minutes?

1182
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,600
I can't... I can't wait.

1183
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,260
You will have a small pick up.
You go.

1184
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:39,050
Sorry.
- It's ok.

1185
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:52,070
Sir I have come.
Where are you?

1186
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:53,770
I have seen you.

1187
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:54,810
Here.

1188
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:07,440
They want land in acres.
Who has got?

1189
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,390
Look, like you say to breed emus
you don't need land in acres.

1190
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,036
Our terrace is enough.
- So you say that we can go ahead?

1191
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:16,220
Yes.
Muruga...

1192
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:18,180
vehicle, emu, set, money.

1193
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:19,520
I will see everything!

1194
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:24,400
See, he gave the advance yesterday.

1195
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,560
Today he has begun the work!

1196
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:26,980
Is it so?

1197
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:29,350
Tell Poovarasan...

1198
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,270
Brother, a person who
hit Sukumar that day...

1199
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,116
Yes.
- You too said he is Utharan's man

1200
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,680
Yes.
- Who is Utharan?

1201
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:37,060
Who is Utharan?

1202
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,536
He is the biggest
financier in the city.

1203
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,480
If he is not there, the middle
class can't survive at all.

1204
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,786
Finance means... what
sort of finance?

1205
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:47,330
If you ask for Rs.100 he
will give you Rs.150...

1206
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,786
make you run for not able
to pay the balance Rs.50...

1207
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:52,130
and earning Rs.500 is
what his business is!

1208
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:54,130
Will he give finance for the car?

1209
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:58,390
I am saying that he will give for
bed, won't he give for the car?

1210
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:02,786
In case you are asked
to pickup again...

1211
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:05,010
say you've personal
work and keep going.

1212
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,060
Hey... did you call the driver?

1213
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:15,250
You had only asked me to
switch off the phone.

1214
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:19,030
Hello... sir is it control room?
- Yes.

1215
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:21,640
Place?
Anna Nagar...

1216
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,970
Hey... who are you?

1217
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:31,616
I have not come here
to fight with you.

1218
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,890
Then... you will carry and go?

1219
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,520
It isn't like that, sir.

1220
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,960
Then why did you come?
Do you know who I am?

1221
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:40,470
I don't know sir... but I know
I can't do anything to you.

1222
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,960
How do you know?
- You have a lot of background!

1223
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:45,350
Leave her.

1224
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,070
Sir, the original document...

1225
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:50,060
Hey... go.

1226
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:51,310
You will get your money.

1227
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:58,610
Sir, don't do anything to me
by keeping this in mind, sir.

1228
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:07,230
Respect!

1229
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:19,280
'in the dream of love,
won't leave your hand...'

1230
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,970
'in the dream of love, your...'

1231
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:29,850
Answer the phone.
- No.

1232
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:38,590
Mridula...
- How many times will you call?

1233
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:40,746
If you call again, I
will break the phone.

1234
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:42,706
Hey... don't talk like
an idiot, Mridula.

1235
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:43,916
I didn't even come for my birthday.

1236
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:45,416
If I am not there with you
on those good moments also...

1237
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,826
did you think that I would
be having some problems.

1238
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:49,010
Aren't you alive?
Hope you aren't dead.

1239
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,560
Put the phone down.

1240
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:53,980
Hey... come out.

1241
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:02,150
Aunty... please aunty.

1242
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:07,400
Please aunty.
Happy Birthday to me!

1243
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,640
Won't you call?

1244
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:11,720
Hey... come out and see!

1245
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:13,310
They are burning the car!

1246
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,440
Oh...!

1247
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:18,690
Oh...!

1248
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:26,270
Come, Mridula.

1249
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:54,190
Wait...!

1250
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,930
What?
- Nothing.

1251
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:00,230
Do you know what this is?
- Chain.

1252
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:04,680
Oh no... this...
- Poovarasan... Mridula!

1253
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,180
This is wife, this is wife.
How is it?

1254
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:11,430
Greetings...!

1255
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:12,430
Again you have come this side!

1256
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,640
No, Sitaraman.

1257
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:16,150
I had a lot of respect
in that party.

1258
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,070
Now is it not there?

1259
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:20,560
He has found out.
The reason to come to your party is

1260
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,140
not because I like
you or your boss.

1261
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:26,560
Somehow I have to become a
member in the 83rd Ward.

1262
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:27,970
Our leader's birthday is coming.

1263
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:29,666
At that time try to join the party.

1264
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:31,810
Won't you bring about
10 people along?

1265
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:33,680
Why are you asking like that?

1266
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:37,070
Everyone around 5 km.
Know who Vadivu is.

1267
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:38,480
Everyone knows you, Vadivu.

1268
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:39,820
If you call will they come?

1269
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:42,030
Will they come if I call?

1270
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,786
Don't talk without
knowing the background.

1271
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:45,130
It is 30 years since I have come.

1272
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:47,286
If I move my finger people
will stand behind me.

1273
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:48,310
See he has come!

1274
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:50,360
What Poovarasan... is it drop?

1275
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:51,850
No, pick up.

1276
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:53,166
He is our boy.
- Is it so?

1277
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:54,480
He will do anything for me.

1278
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:55,570
Don't believe him.

1279
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:56,820
I won't do anything for him.

1280
01:13:57,310 --> 01:13:58,680
Then Poovarasan, have you eaten?

1281
01:13:58,940 --> 01:13:59,940
If not will you feed me?

1282
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:01,180
He is talking sarcastically.

1283
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,470
Myself and his family
are extremely close!

1284
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,956
He will always talk
like this jokingly!

1285
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:09,360
Not only he, the entire
area is like this.

1286
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,786
He is lying.
- Then...

1287
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:12,010
you have created a good party.

1288
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:13,570
Is it any ordinary matter, Vadivu?

1289
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,560
Greetings.
Bye.

1290
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,810
Created a party.

1291
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:19,890
There is only problem
in every town.

1292
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:21,270
Go carefully.

1293
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,060
Come early tomorrow.
- Ok, bye.

1294
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:32,650
Hey...
- Mother is there upstairs!

1295
01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:35,270
What are you doing?
- Just like that.

1296
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:44,350
How long are you going
to be like this?

1297
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,100
Mridula...

1298
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:49,866
Take me to your father and
we can discuss marriage.

1299
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:50,890
Yes you can talk.

1300
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,430
No, I still have to go and buy.

1301
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:57,050
Why are you pulling a
long face and coming?

1302
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,416
I can take her to him
and make her talk...

1303
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,366
unnecessarily he will be constantly
saying brother is missing.

1304
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:03,576
My father...
- Don't give excuses.

1305
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,600
You can't isn't it?

1306
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:06,480
Hey, why are you getting angry now?

1307
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,496
Somehow we will move on to
the next stage in life.

1308
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,520
We can tell at that time.

1309
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,840
What is there like a next stage?

1310
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:13,416
Still giving birth to
a child is remaining.

1311
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,570
You can do that now itself.

1312
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:16,300
There is no need for a marriage.

1313
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:18,100
Is there a route like that!

1314
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,560
Then shall we go directly?

1315
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,230
You all are not human beings.

1316
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,070
Animals.

1317
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:24,860
Why did you hit?

1318
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:26,286
Then what do you want me to do?

1319
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:27,510
You are talking like a loafer.

1320
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,600
I asked you to wait.

1321
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,680
I can't wait for you anymore.

1322
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:33,140
I want a decision now.

1323
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:49,820
Father, I will bring that girl.
Will you talk?

1324
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:53,890
Go and bring her.
We can talk.

1325
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:58,270
Go.

1326
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,970
Father, Mridula's mother.

1327
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,916
Which is your family deity?
- There is no special family deity.

1328
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:33,780
But we pray Thandoneeswarar.

1329
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,680
For us it is Sudalai madan.

1330
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:36,996
It won't suit you, isn't it?

1331
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:39,020
Father.
- No, not used to it.

1332
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:40,230
The girl is good looking.

1333
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,760
You have found a good
match for yourself.

1334
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:44,230
But it won't fit our family.

1335
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:48,206
Father, you said you liked her
and asked me to bring them.

1336
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:49,416
Now why do you talk unnecessarily.

1337
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,480
Hey, I am not talking
unnecessarily.

1338
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:54,286
I thought you will bring
someone from our caste.

1339
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:55,810
Look father, don't talk nonsense.

1340
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:57,706
That's the respect you will get.
Leave it.

1341
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:59,116
I will take care of my life myself.

1342
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:00,140
Even now what you do?

1343
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:03,100
You only take care of your life.

1344
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,536
You are talking as if you
are doing something new.

1345
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,640
Has brought.

1346
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,640
You wait in the car.

1347
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,220
Won't you like if I am happy?

1348
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,116
Should be crying
looking at the sky...

1349
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,260
saying brother went missing.

1350
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:24,390
Then you will be happy.

1351
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,666
Do you want me to live
or go missing like him?

1352
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:29,690
Shouldn't I have a life?

1353
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:31,770
You have lived happily.

1354
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,760
My mother should have been there.

1355
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:38,410
If she was there would she
have chased me like this?

1356
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:45,640
Did you see how he is talking?

1357
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,246
Uncle, if he likes, let
him lead his life.

1358
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:50,770
Let him lead a life, did I say no?

1359
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:52,260
Did you see whom he has brought?

1360
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:56,090
Searching for the one who is lost,
don't lose the one who is there.

1361
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:57,600
Somehow he will come.

1362
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,666
Let him come and say let the
brother lead his life...

1363
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:00,996
then let him do whatever he wants.

1364
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:02,020
Why should I bother?

1365
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,580
Then if he doesn't return
what will you do, uncle?

1366
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:11,770
You too believe only that?

1367
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:14,866
If a person doesn't come home
even after so many days...

1368
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,020
one has to believe.

1369
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,430
Then, if a man doesn't come home...

1370
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,350
does it mean that he is dead?

1371
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:24,536
Uncle, if he doesn't come home
on the first day, we can search.

1372
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,576
If he doesn't return on the 2nd
day, we can give a complaint.

1373
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,616
If a person doesn't come home
for the past 2 years...

1374
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,680
one can only say
that he is no more.

1375
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,866
I am asking you to wait.
Don't I know about that man?

1376
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:53,100
If you just say this man, that man
you won't get any respect, go.

1377
01:18:53,310 --> 01:18:54,310
Go and get lost.

1378
01:18:58,270 --> 01:18:58,640
Hello...

1379
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,956
Poovarasan, your father has
met with an accident.

1380
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:01,980
Father.

1381
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:18,390
'come... son you come'

1382
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:25,780
'son you come'

1383
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,940
'can't forget, you come'

1384
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,680
'I am tired of crying'

1385
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:42,520
'the town is talking,
it is all over'

1386
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:50,100
Hey brother, bring the money.

1387
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:53,320
Brother, it is not yet 1st.

1388
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:54,770
So you won't pay the due?

1389
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:56,850
Give me two day's time.

1390
01:19:57,190 --> 01:19:59,416
Brother, for the first due
itself you are creating problem.

1391
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,360
I will come back.
Keep the money.

1392
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:04,746
Where are you?
- Why are you asking?

1393
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:05,770
No, I have to see you.

1394
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:07,880
Then shall we meet at the Mall?

1395
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,520
I want to ask you a
few things openly.

1396
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,800
Interesting!
Ask.

1397
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:18,530
I always think about you.

1398
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:22,470
I myself feel as if I
am very close to you.

1399
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,350
Isn't that wrong?

1400
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,440
Surely it is wrong.

1401
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:29,770
I think you have a fascination
for my structure.

1402
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:31,890
This is not a big problem.

1403
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,366
If you start moving with
someone better than me...

1404
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:35,470
this will automatically go.

1405
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:40,261
You said you don't have
faith in marriage.

1406
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:42,530
Then don't you have trust in men?

1407
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:45,320
I have a lot of trust in men.

1408
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,180
But the one who comes
as a husband...

1409
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,800
I don't have trust in him at all.

1410
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,881
Didn't understand.
- One day, late night...

1411
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,390
I come home totally drunk.

1412
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,520
Then what will you do?

1413
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:57,190
I will punch the face.

1414
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,706
You will punch, isn't it?
Suppose you drink and come...

1415
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:00,730
can I punch you?

1416
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:02,070
I won't drink at all.

1417
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:03,860
Oh... is it so!

1418
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:06,850
Ok, you go to your girl
friend's birthday party.

1419
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:09,100
Hey stop... I don't
have a girl friend.

1420
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:10,746
Why do you think about a
person who is not there?

1421
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:11,850
Now you don't have.

1422
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:13,366
What if you have one
after marriage?

1423
01:21:13,390 --> 01:21:15,496
What do you say... that we
are not a perfect match.

1424
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,560
Isn't it?
- Not between you and me...

1425
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:21,380
if a girl thinks like this, she
won't be a perfect match to anyone.

1426
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:25,456
Where will your father be?
- He will be at home.

1427
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,150
Why do you ask?

1428
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:30,810
I want to ask him why he has
kept such a brilliant girl here.

1429
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:33,070
That is why.
You go.

1430
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,070
You go and be free.

1431
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:45,190
Block him.

1432
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,956
Hey, I had warned you
that day itself.

1433
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:52,416
Then why did you buy
her the scooty?

1434
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,280
No uncle...
- What...?

1435
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,720
You bought her so that
she will love you?

1436
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:00,600
Hey... not only you...

1437
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:01,980
she won't love anyone.

1438
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:05,230
How do you know that?

1439
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,496
I am with her for
the past 25 years.

1440
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,520
Won't I know?

1441
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:10,150
Uncle, will you help me?

1442
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,706
It would be better if you
pay this scooty's due.

1443
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:18,330
I will take care.
You go.

1444
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,680
Then you tell your daughter...

1445
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:22,496
not to move around in a
friendly way with boys like me.

1446
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,800
Why?
- No uncle...

1447
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,786
we immediately fix
that this is the girl.

1448
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:28,571
But when she says that she
wants to keep travelling...

1449
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:31,890
there is a kind of tension.

1450
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:34,020
Why is 'sir' getting tensed?

1451
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:38,530
Then you won't see any
girl in your life!

1452
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:39,890
No uncle, that...

1453
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:53,790
Adi, I am telling and you
are raising your hand.

1454
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:56,790
Adi, just now I gave it to Sukumar.

1455
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:57,956
He said he'll give
the amount tonight.

1456
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:58,400
Come and collect it.

1457
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:00,206
What if you die?
- What?

1458
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:01,860
What if you die at night?

1459
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,680
You...
- I told you I will give at night.

1460
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:11,140
Adi... this is our party.

1461
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:12,230
Don't raise your hand.

1462
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:14,150
Hey... that's it.
Who are you?

1463
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:15,020
Who...?

1464
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:17,746
Adi, you have settled only the
loan that you have taken.

1465
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:20,286
Interest amount of Rs.75,000
is still remaining.

1466
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:22,286
Give that and move
out of this place.

1467
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:24,116
Hey Vanangamudi, isn't
it an insult to you.

1468
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:26,416
If only you had paid the
monthly due regularly...

1469
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,996
you could have taken
the loan from us.

1470
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:30,820
Leave it, I will sell the
shop and settle both of them.

1471
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,320
What?
First you settle my money.

1472
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,116
Then someone would have opened a
finance shop in a dirty lane...

1473
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:36,720
give him.

1474
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:38,786
What did you say?
- What did I say?

1475
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:40,246
First settle the amount.
- No... no.

1476
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:41,270
Now you said something.

1477
01:23:41,690 --> 01:23:44,090
I said he is doing
financing in a dirty lane.

1478
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:03,180
Brother, Vanangamudi
has made a mistake.

1479
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:03,980
Why?

1480
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,956
He has taken finance
from Babu Jain also.

1481
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:08,166
Adi and his boys had
come for collection.

1482
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:09,820
What has to be done now for that?

1483
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:11,100
That is why I called you.

1484
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,280
Arunachalam, Sukumar
are in that area only.

1485
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:16,030
Ok, I will call and talk to them.

1486
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,520
Tell.
- I had called brother.

1487
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:21,980
Brother spoke just now.

1488
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:23,520
I will bring Sukumar along.

1489
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,100
Sir.

1490
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:30,480
Brother, tell me.

1491
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,430
Hridayan, you gave a scooter
to that bike shop boy...

1492
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,240
Yes.
- That I will settle.

1493
01:24:35,690 --> 01:24:37,286
Henceforth there is no need to
go to that boy for collection.

1494
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:38,430
Ok, I will tell the boys.

1495
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,020
What is it?

1496
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:44,366
Umpire had gone for collection
and someone has hit him.

1497
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:45,870
Who is he?
Which area?

1498
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:53,940
Who is the one?
- Adi.

1499
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:58,410
I didn't take the gun as I
was going for collectiion.

1500
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:02,680
You... did you tell
Utharan that you got hit?

1501
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:05,970
Don't go in front of Utharan.

1502
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:14,600
Napoleon, Adi has hit umpire.

1503
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:15,956
The elder one is going ahead.

1504
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:16,780
This is a chance for you.

1505
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:17,900
You go and kill Adi.

1506
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,326
I will tell brother that Napoleon
had done it and you will come in.

1507
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:21,430
I will come in and do what?

1508
01:25:21,770 --> 01:25:23,746
He will call my name Napoleon aloud.
I will have to go and stand.

1509
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:24,350
Isn't that all?

1510
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,600
Don't think like that.

1511
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:27,270
Even now your place is vacant.

1512
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:29,280
If you come, it is good.

1513
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,780
Hey... why are you so
concerned about me?

1514
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:35,166
You want to know who killed the
one who was with you, isn't it?

1515
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:36,280
She was not with me at all.

1516
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:39,980
Then who was it?

1517
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:41,746
What are you going
to do knowing it?

1518
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:46,390
Hey... none of those who sat
on this bike are alive.

1519
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:48,480
Other than the two of us.

1520
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:51,270
So what?

1521
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,390
Be careful with that man.

1522
01:26:01,770 --> 01:26:02,770
But don't be truthful.

1523
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:08,956
Brother... we should kill
the moment we see and go.

1524
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:10,570
See where it has fallen!

1525
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:15,496
Hey who are you sir?
There is camera at the top.

1526
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,520
Go.

1527
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,060
Camera...

1528
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:21,510
Now it will not be seen isn't it?

1529
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,230
Tell me where Adi is.

1530
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,800
We will kill all of
you and keep moving.

1531
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:32,520
Babu knows that we won't
cross Ambattur and come.

1532
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:34,320
Why did you come?
Go.

1533
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:36,166
Have you understood the area?

1534
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:37,996
Doesn't anyone come
to borrow money?

1535
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:41,020
Babu has done.
Now we have to do.

1536
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:42,866
No one should come and stand here.

1537
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:45,076
If someone wants finance
they should come to us.

1538
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,140
We have to do it that way.

1539
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:47,390
Hey, bring the phone.

1540
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:51,180
Call Babu.
- Call Babu.

1541
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:56,730
Babu, your boys have
made a mistake.

1542
01:26:56,980 --> 01:27:00,570
What Arunachalam, my boys
are playing game at home.

1543
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:02,350
Do you have boys at home only?

1544
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,680
Have you come to the office?

1545
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,720
Have you put the blame on Adi?

1546
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:08,390
It is ok.

1547
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:12,930
You break a few tables,
chairs, glasses...

1548
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,560
go and tell Utharan.

1549
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:16,020
He will feel proud!

1550
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:21,706
Sir, two 'Tumblers' are coming
here and creating problems.

1551
01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:23,850
Hey it is not Tumblers,
but Tamilians.

1552
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:25,740
Tell Tamilians.
- Tamilians.

1553
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:35,600
Utharan... everything is wrong.

1554
01:27:35,770 --> 01:27:36,770
Boys are not ok.

1555
01:27:36,810 --> 01:27:39,571
They won't be scared, Utharan.
The business will fail.

1556
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:41,900
It is very painful, Utharan.

1557
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:42,890
What is my age?

1558
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:43,980
Am I not 55?

1559
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,076
Now if I go and hit four
people will it be good?

1560
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:49,260
If Arunachalam is hitting it means
Utharamurthy has become weak.

1561
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,070
Napoleon...
- Brother...

1562
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,326
What happened to that boy?

1563
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:55,720
He has become very strong.

1564
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:57,350
Why did you go and see him?

1565
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,246
Babu Jain's boys raised
their hand on umpire.

1566
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:00,470
I became crazy.

1567
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,116
Had he been there he would
have done something.

1568
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:03,500
That is why I went and called him.

1569
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:06,720
Sukumar... follow the boy.

1570
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:08,166
Why are you asking
him to follow me?

1571
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:09,320
Ask him to follow Napoleon.

1572
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:13,286
Two months ago Napoleon sent a boy
and asked me to give him a scooty.

1573
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:14,310
I had a doubt.

1574
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:16,166
I went and saw to whom
he gave the scooty...

1575
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:18,230
that was for
Arunachalam's daughter!

1576
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:22,150
Arunachalam, you are
standing like a statue.

1577
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:24,610
What this boy says is true?

1578
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:28,890
It is true.

1579
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:43,290
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1580
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,850
Hey quickly bring Rs.5.

1581
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:54,720
Where is the scooty?
- It is at home.

1582
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:56,190
Is it at home?

1583
01:28:57,390 --> 01:28:59,950
Stick this sticker on the
forehead of the scooty.

1584
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:12,286
I know that he bought the scooty
from us and gave it to my daughter.

1585
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:14,670
But I didn't know that
he is Napoleon's man.

1586
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:15,720
Hridayam...
- Yes.

1587
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:16,850
He will corner you.

1588
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,326
He'll do it very intelligently also.
- I will take care.

1589
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:21,576
Utharam... why are you giving
so much importance to him?

1590
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,520
Leave it to me.
I will take care.

1591
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:27,190
You said that you are old.
Go home.

1592
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:29,246
You are making a mistake, Utharan.

1593
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:32,550
Hey, he has come to your house and
that too without your knowledge.

1594
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:36,140
You are a big man.
Go.

1595
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:38,826
Utharan... I have stayed
with you for 9 years.

1596
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:39,970
Give me this one chance.

1597
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:44,550
Like you said after that I will go
not to my house but to my town.

1598
01:29:45,230 --> 01:29:48,110
Arunachalam, he has
been brought up by me.

1599
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:50,230
Only I know about him.

1600
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:07,890
Utharan's boys entered
our office...

1601
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:10,036
they have killed Adi,
do you know that?

1602
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:11,166
Why did he go to that extreme?

1603
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:13,360
You got retired and
settled in life.

1604
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:14,970
Current DC Marimuthu...

1605
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:17,390
is in the custody of Utharan.

1606
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:20,650
Both of them are the same 'belt'.
What are you going to do?

1607
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:22,220
All that I will take care, Babu.

1608
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:25,140
Leave it... I gave you
3200 gms jewellery...

1609
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:28,050
where have you kept it?
- It is in my locker.

1610
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:29,866
What are you going
to do to Utharan?

1611
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:31,430
Drop it in the hundi and tell...

1612
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:32,866
I will take care of Utharan.

1613
01:30:32,890 --> 01:30:34,090
Then you won't do before that.

1614
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:37,890
Babu... is Utharan
working in a hotel?

1615
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:39,510
To quickly stab him and come?

1616
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:42,456
Arrange a person who knows
his daily activities.

1617
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,480
We can kill him.

1618
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:53,100
Brother...

1619
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:55,286
How long has that boy
not paid the due?

1620
01:30:55,310 --> 01:30:57,100
For 2 months.
- Kidnap him.

1621
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:07,100
Take out a 10,000.

1622
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:09,390
I have told that girl's father.

1623
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,280
Hasn't that man paid yet?

1624
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:11,640
Wait... just now I will...

1625
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:23,860
What is he saying?

1626
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,260
He is asking why should he pay.

1627
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,430
Why?
- He is asking, answer him.

1628
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:32,930
For the first time in my
life a girl loved me.

1629
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:35,770
I bought her a scooty with love.

1630
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:39,450
It is ok you gave.
You have to pay the due isn't it?

1631
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:47,030
Sir now, that girl is not
with me nor the scooty.

1632
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:48,530
Why should I pay the due, sir?

1633
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,310
Where is it?
- What?

1634
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:56,576
Where is the girl?
- Brother our Arunachalam...

1635
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,020
Where is the girl?
- Boys have gone.

1636
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:00,230
They will come.

1637
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:11,560
Is the scooty with you?
- Yes sir.

1638
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:12,730
Give it to Vasan.

1639
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:15,190
He will settle the money.
- I won't, sir.

1640
01:32:19,190 --> 01:32:21,610
Why?
- Sir, when I was in 1st standard...

1641
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:24,050
a girl named Esther
presented me an eraser.

1642
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:26,480
This is the one.

1643
01:32:27,390 --> 01:32:30,350
When I was in 8th, a boy, Ponraj
gifted me a Raynolds pen.

1644
01:32:31,810 --> 01:32:32,810
This is that one.

1645
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:34,890
When I was in 11th standard

1646
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:37,780
a boy, Pandiyan presented a
cell phone for my birthday.

1647
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:43,260
Scooty is also just like that.

1648
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:44,470
My father bought it.

1649
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:46,100
That should be with me.

1650
01:32:46,850 --> 01:32:48,270
Because everything is my memory.

1651
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,480
How can I give it to him?

1652
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,680
She is Arunachalam's daughter.
- So what?

1653
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:54,826
If she is Arunachalam's
daughter won't she lie?

1654
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:55,850
Go.

1655
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:04,860
Hey... have you seen this boy?
Along with Vasan?

1656
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:11,640
Go.

1657
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:17,310
What have you poeple planned?

1658
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:20,310
How do you know Napoleon?
- Sir...

1659
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,360
Are you Babu Jain's boy?
- No sir.

1660
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:27,100
Sir... I went to Napoleon and
told him that I want a scooty.

1661
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:30,060
He only asked me to
meet Hridayam, sir.

1662
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:33,616
Other than that really I
don't know anything sir.

1663
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:35,160
Hridayam...
- Brother...

1664
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:36,520
What are you doing?

1665
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:38,286
Tomorrow there is a branch
opening in Nolambur.

1666
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:39,560
I was telling the time to DC.

1667
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:45,640
Ok, do you have any
vengence against me?

1668
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:50,140
No.
- After I trust you fully...

1669
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:53,889
you will be with me and
do something to me...

1670
01:33:53,890 --> 01:33:54,890
Are you doubting me?

1671
01:33:57,350 --> 01:34:00,470
I asked you just like that.

1672
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,666
Hey... will you give
the document or not?

1673
01:34:24,690 --> 01:34:26,940
Hey... I have come
to take the money.

1674
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:29,730
I will take the money
and then call.

1675
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,420
Sir is inside.
Go.

1676
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:40,890
Brother, tell me finally...

1677
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,786
don't make me run
around unnecessarily.

1678
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:43,810
Will you give or not.

1679
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:47,640
What Napoleon, now itself you are
talking without respecting me.

1680
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:50,350
Oh... it is nothing like that.

1681
01:34:51,390 --> 01:34:54,390
You are living with money.
I am running after money.

1682
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:58,180
When I know there is a lot of
difference between the two of us...

1683
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:00,850
it aches.

1684
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:03,600
Hey... can I just give,
as soon as you ask?

1685
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:06,826
If you do one thing for me, I
will do one thing for you.

1686
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:08,270
Only then it will be a business.

1687
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:11,100
Brother, what can I do?

1688
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,326
Is it confirmed that a branch
is being opened for Sukumar?

1689
01:35:50,350 --> 01:35:50,890
Yes.

1690
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:53,830
Then shall we keep the
assignment for tomorrow?

1691
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:56,850
Brother, I am waiting there
for this moment for so long.

1692
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:01,220
Hey DC, you have to
do it very carefully, ok?

1693
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:03,030
I will be there on the spot, Babu.

1694
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:04,310
I will take care.

1695
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:06,110
Inorder to open Mogappair branch...

1696
01:36:06,270 --> 01:36:07,850
Utharan has invited me.

1697
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:10,140
Only I alone should be there.

1698
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:13,770
He should not come at all.
Go.

1699
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:21,100
Why are you standing?

1700
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:32,400
No brother Babu, I don't
wish to kill him.

1701
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:36,190
In this interest business,
to live nicely...

1702
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:38,440
to earn a lot...

1703
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:41,100
only one problem will
arise inbetween.

1704
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:44,680
Based on how we handle
that problem...

1705
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:46,890
our business will thrive.

1706
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:49,996
You have been with Utharan
for so many years...

1707
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:51,140
do you know what it is?

1708
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:54,860
If one exceeds our power...

1709
01:36:55,230 --> 01:36:56,610
he should be finished.

1710
01:36:57,270 --> 01:37:00,390
Will you do?
We both can do business together?

1711
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:14,480
When did you come here?

1712
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:17,980
Napoleon, I started here and
I learnt the business here.

1713
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:19,440
Come.

1714
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:31,720
Uncle, where is grandfather?

1715
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:34,206
Grandfather has gone to God.

1716
01:37:34,230 --> 01:37:35,690
Do you have any feeling?

1717
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:37,850
Father has gone to God.

1718
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:39,780
Grandfather has died.

1719
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:42,500
Hey Kirthana... that man
will never come now.

1720
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:47,810
Each one will have 1000s of work.
Ask him to go and do that.

1721
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:56,780
Through this pipe...

1722
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:00,786
Brother has taken loan from this
finance company and bought a car.

1723
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:02,116
But hasn't paid even a single due.

1724
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:04,366
How do you know that he
has not paid the due?

1725
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:05,890
Where was it all these days?

1726
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:07,916
It was lying in the car in
which father had an accident.

1727
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:10,180
Look inside.
All the pages are like this.

1728
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:13,866
This was given by the finance
company to your brother.

1729
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:15,706
They would have noted
down separately.

1730
01:38:15,730 --> 01:38:17,890
No Mridula, I think
something is wrong.

1731
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:19,180
Will you act for me just once?

1732
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:26,350
Don't worry about tomorrow.

1733
01:38:26,890 --> 01:38:30,100
Lord says that he is there for us.

1734
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:31,350
What does it mean?

1735
01:38:31,690 --> 01:38:34,246
Even though you may be
ruling this entire world...

1736
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:36,220
this world doesn't belong to you.

1737
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:41,390
So Lord says not to
worry about tomorrow.

1738
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:45,820
Sir... sir.

1739
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:48,610
Do you know this finance company?

1740
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:53,786
Listen, whatever you want
come to the station and ask.

1741
01:38:53,810 --> 01:38:54,890
You are asking in a Church!

1742
01:38:55,390 --> 01:38:57,456
I am not used to coming
to the station, sir.

1743
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:58,800
There is a problem in the family.

1744
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,050
I had borrowed a small amount.

1745
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:01,310
They are threatening that

1746
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:04,800
if I don't pay the amount today
they will abduct and molest me, sir.

1747
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:07,060
I am scared.
Please help me, sir.

1748
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:13,850
You go home.
I will come.

1749
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,116
Which is your home town?
Is it Chennai?

1750
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:23,269
No sir.
Salem.

1751
01:39:23,270 --> 01:39:24,350
Where are you staying here?

1752
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:26,036
Mogappair.
- I will do one thing.

1753
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:28,366
I will vacate your house and
get you a ticket to Selam.

1754
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:29,390
Run away.

1755
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,520
Why sir?
- These are big groups!

1756
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:33,616
If caught you can't escape.
I am saying for your own good.

1757
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,470
Sir, I have got a job just now.

1758
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:37,076
How can I go back to my home town?

1759
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:38,100
Do something, sir.

1760
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:39,440
Hey, what do you want me to do?

1761
01:39:39,770 --> 01:39:41,100
This is how a boy like you...

1762
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:43,706
has lost his brother to that
group and is after me.

1763
01:39:43,730 --> 01:39:44,780
What could I do?

1764
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:46,076
I was only able to cheat him.

1765
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:48,416
I am not cheating you.
I am telling the truth.

1766
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:51,076
You repay the entire money
borrowed from him with interest.

1767
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,390
Or else, run away.

1768
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,900
You listen to me carefully.

1769
01:40:20,230 --> 01:40:22,616
If your aim is to kill the one
who killed your brother...

1770
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:24,960
it is this group which
killed your brother.

1771
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:26,770
Or else, you too have a life...

1772
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:29,366
if you wish to know whether your
brother is dead or alive...

1773
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:30,390
your brother is dead.

1774
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:32,536
It is not this group
which killed him.

1775
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,116
Later on don't get into
trouble and suffer.

1776
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:35,140
That's all.

1777
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,850
Why did you hit me?

1778
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:39,996
I didn't hit you sir.
You have said the truth so soon.

1779
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:41,340
That is why I gave you the bribe.

1780
01:40:50,850 --> 01:40:51,850
Go carefully.

1781
01:40:51,890 --> 01:40:53,536
Let the plan be secret.
- Ok Napoleon.

1782
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:54,560
Will meet at the spot.

1783
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:01,400
Poovarasan... don't get emotional.

1784
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:02,480
Come in, let us talk.

1785
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:08,520
I am telling you.
Shall I shoot?

1786
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:10,500
Will you also go like your brother?

1787
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:14,850
Poor thing... Mridula.
Go.

1788
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:31,746
You know your brother Punyakoti,
only as a call taxi driver.

1789
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:33,060
Do you know who Robert is?

1790
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:38,366
I am nothing in front of him
in doing the assignment.

1791
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:40,510
If he corners a party,
he is finished.

1792
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:46,786
Your brother's car would have stood
without any scratch below a bridge.

1793
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:47,810
Do you know why?

1794
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:50,790
Utharan knows what problem
your family is facing.

1795
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:54,890
Do you know you
didn't get the body?

1796
01:41:55,310 --> 01:41:56,850
No one knows who Punyakoti is.

1797
01:41:57,190 --> 01:41:58,650
But everyone knows who Robert is.

1798
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:01,706
If you collect a crowd by pasting
a poster mourning his death...

1799
01:42:01,730 --> 01:42:02,780
then what do we do?

1800
01:42:03,230 --> 01:42:04,536
I have been going to the police
station for the past 2 years.

1801
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:05,920
Not one police man said the truth.

1802
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:07,666
You too say that my brother
has been murdered...

1803
01:42:07,690 --> 01:42:08,940
you are not saying how he died.

1804
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:13,060
Hey... policeman will not give
an answer to all the cases.

1805
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:16,246
Villivakkam Railway Station.
Two wheeler stand's auction.

1806
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:17,100
The fight is going on

1807
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:18,110
between Utharan and Babu.

1808
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:20,140
20 lakhs...
- 20 lakhs once...

1809
01:42:23,390 --> 01:42:25,560
25...
- 25 lakhs...

1810
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:27,270
50 lakhs...

1811
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:31,680
Said it is for us.

1812
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:35,320
50 lakhs twice...
50 lakhs thrice.

1813
01:42:36,390 --> 01:42:37,640
Babu Jain sir, come.

1814
01:42:38,190 --> 01:42:39,190
Come and sign.

1815
01:42:40,890 --> 01:42:41,890
Take sir.

1816
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:51,890
Robert... come to the office.

1817
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:52,980
Ok, we will talk, ok?

1818
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:56,956
Utharan calls me and says...
Napoleon...

1819
01:42:56,980 --> 01:42:59,220
Robert has been bought
by Babu, kill him.

1820
01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:01,390
That Robert said that Raghupathy

1821
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:04,080
will finalise that place
for 25 lakhs and give us.

1822
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:05,680
Why he is going up to 50 lakhs?

1823
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:07,616
That is what even I
don't understand.

1824
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:08,640
Didn't understand?

1825
01:43:08,690 --> 01:43:11,416
Robert has sold himself to Babu
Jain for a higher pay.

1826
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,440
Kill him.

1827
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:16,140
He told me that Babu Jain bargained
with him but he refused.

1828
01:43:16,230 --> 01:43:20,690
Then how can he easily give Rs.3
lakhs and buy a car from me?

1829
01:43:20,810 --> 01:43:22,956
He said that he bought it with
the money his brother earned.

1830
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:25,780
Hey... he gives Rs.100
daily to his brother.

1831
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:27,640
What are you saying?

1832
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:31,680
Napoleon, didn't you
wish to ride the bullet?

1833
01:43:32,850 --> 01:43:34,890
Henceforth only you
have to ride it.

1834
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:36,890
Finish him.

1835
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:47,980
Do you know what I did?
I have been with him for 4 years.

1836
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:49,780
I said it is wrong.
Come out.

1837
01:43:49,850 --> 01:43:52,611
He too came out running
thinking that I am in trouble.

1838
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,706
Hey Robert, they have
planned to kill us.

1839
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:55,650
Hey... who is it?
- Come.

1840
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:56,640
Where?

1841
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:37,480
Where?

1842
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:54,810
I shot him.
He died... that's all.

1843
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,920
If you still want more
evidence, then come.

1844
01:45:08,190 --> 01:45:09,730
In 2013 since the time we killed

1845
01:45:09,850 --> 01:45:11,286
Babu Jain's man at the
Thirumoolar Bus Stand

1846
01:45:11,310 --> 01:45:14,116
till we killed Ondrai Thalivar at
the Avadi Amman Temple entrance

1847
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:16,076
the evidence of all the murders
which your brother did are in this.

1848
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:17,100
Take.

1849
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:24,850
Probably it is your
brother's curse...

1850
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:27,010
today I am standing
in the same stage.

1851
01:45:27,190 --> 01:45:30,310
Don't know if he is going to kill
me or am I going to kill him.

1852
01:45:31,390 --> 01:45:32,390
Will you come along?

1853
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:34,600
To watch the fun.

1854
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:53,970
Hey Utharan... this stand is
with me for the past 20 years.

1855
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:55,810
Then why do you cross my path?

1856
01:45:56,270 --> 01:45:58,076
My boys had come to
Adayar for collection...

1857
01:45:58,100 --> 01:45:58,890
you ask your boys to beat them.

1858
01:45:59,020 --> 01:45:59,810
Won't it hurt me?

1859
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:03,400
Hey... if one is
dominating one area...

1860
01:46:03,810 --> 01:46:05,020
he should not be antagonised.

1861
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:06,496
Then if your boys
come to Ambattur...

1862
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:07,536
shall I cut them to pieces?

1863
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:10,270
Utharan... you wish to grow.

1864
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:12,280
I will give way.

1865
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:16,060
Instead if you think that you will
come to Adayar and create problem...

1866
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:18,920
you won't know when and
where I will kill you.

1867
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:23,720
Since the age of 20, I have been
searching as to who my enemy is.

1868
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,970
My eyes can't see you as my enemy.
Go.

1869
01:46:41,190 --> 01:46:44,230
Babu, have you planned
any assignment for me?

1870
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:45,770
No Utharan.

1871
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:49,020
A boy from your group has planned.

1872
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:52,820
I am only helping him.

1873
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:54,520
That's all.

1874
01:46:58,810 --> 01:47:00,470
Hridhayam.
- Brother...

1875
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,240
Can you drive the car?
- I can.

1876
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:10,390
Start the car.

1877
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:20,300
In which place is the assignment?

1878
01:47:20,350 --> 01:47:22,390
Brother, why do you
always doubt me?

1879
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:25,400
Do you know what the one who
was with you is going to do?

1880
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:28,930
If one overtakes our power...
he should be killed.

1881
01:47:28,940 --> 01:47:31,116
Don't always think that only the
affected one will take revenge.

1882
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:32,680
Shall we do business together?

1883
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:41,580
Umpire...
- Brother...

1884
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:43,390
you need not follow me.

1885
01:47:44,270 --> 01:47:46,020
Go to Nolambur branch.
- Ok.

1886
01:47:46,890 --> 01:47:48,020
Hey... Nolambur branch.

1887
01:47:58,350 --> 01:48:01,600
Where are you now?
- I thought you won't come!

1888
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:03,290
How can I believe whatever you say?

1889
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:06,350
Come, get in.

1890
01:48:20,850 --> 01:48:25,020
Napoleon, don't use the gun in
emotion as soon as the car stops.

1891
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:26,786
You have to take him
out and then shoot.

1892
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:28,850
Why?
- Babu Jain has said.

1893
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:29,980
Hey... move the jeep.

1894
01:48:31,850 --> 01:48:32,850
What is this?

1895
01:49:08,350 --> 01:49:09,350
Hey... police!

1896
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:03,520
Hey... come.

1897
01:50:29,850 --> 01:50:32,470
Hey... till now I have
done only good to you.

1898
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:34,206
Then why do you come
and stand like this?

1899
01:50:34,230 --> 01:50:36,820
Brother, I didn't want
to fly away leaving you.

1900
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,030
I wanted to be with you
and be everything to you.

1901
01:50:40,890 --> 01:50:42,180
You threw me far away.

1902
01:50:42,810 --> 01:50:44,850
That is why I am
standing like this.

1903
01:50:45,810 --> 01:50:47,996
Now if he shoots me,
I will die happily.

1904
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:49,380
Because I have caused harm to him.

1905
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:51,536
That is why you have
kept him with you.

1906
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:52,560
He is making mistakes.

1907
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:54,220
Do you know what all he has done?

1908
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:55,310
Hridayam.

1909
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:09,610
What have you done?
- You only called Hridayam.

1910
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:11,310
That is why I shot him.

1911
01:51:18,770 --> 01:51:20,520
Madhi... buisness rivalry...

1912
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:22,166
say it is gang war
and finish the case.

1913
01:51:22,190 --> 01:51:23,190
Ok, sir.

1914
01:51:35,890 --> 01:51:37,746
Hey... no one need
to know about all this.

1915
01:51:37,770 --> 01:51:38,770
I will take care.

1916
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:43,326
Babu sir, you come as soon
as I inform the Press.

1917
01:51:43,350 --> 01:51:44,350
Ok.

1918
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:56,826
Why are you asking us to
start all of a sudden?

1919
01:51:56,850 --> 01:51:57,520
Sister in law, come fast

1920
01:51:57,560 --> 01:51:59,246
if we stay here longer
it will be problem.

1921
01:51:59,270 --> 01:52:00,140
Why?
What happened?

1922
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:00,970
Came to know who brother is.

1923
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:02,616
Came to know where he
was and what he did, everything.

1924
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:04,866
But we can't do anything.
Come fast, let's go.

1925
01:52:04,890 --> 01:52:05,430
What is this?

1926
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:06,746
We can go to our
home town and talk.

1927
01:52:06,770 --> 01:52:07,770
You please come.

1928
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:11,746
Are you asking us to run
leaving everything behind?

1929
01:52:11,770 --> 01:52:13,166
Sister in law, I don't
know any other way.

1930
01:52:13,190 --> 01:52:17,280
If he is saying so much then
there is surely some problem.

1931
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:18,770
First you leave from here.

1932
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:19,850
Rest I will take care.

1933
01:52:20,850 --> 01:52:22,456
Poovarasan, first
take them from here.

1934
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:23,480
I will myself lock.

1935
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:25,560
Take them.

1936
01:52:28,270 --> 01:52:29,390
Start.
- Come.

1937
01:52:29,850 --> 01:52:30,850
I will send.

1938
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:46,220
Come.
- Do we surely have to go?

1939
01:52:49,810 --> 01:52:52,246
By coming away from home
town we can earn money here.

1940
01:52:52,270 --> 01:52:53,916
But we can live only if
we earn a background.

1941
01:52:53,940 --> 01:52:54,940
Come, let's go.

1942
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:24,956
Greetings to all those
who are present here.

1943
01:53:24,980 --> 01:53:27,320
This is our 26th branch.

1944
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:31,230
I killed a person
who was with me.

1945
01:53:32,230 --> 01:53:36,230
Utharan, you and I
can fight all the time.

1946
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:40,100
But the one who was under us...

1947
01:53:40,890 --> 01:53:42,100
raises above us...

1948
01:53:42,730 --> 01:53:44,230
and fights with us only...

1949
01:53:44,810 --> 01:53:45,970
do you think it will be good?

1950
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:53,270
All this is being done as a service
by brother in public interest.

1951
01:53:53,850 --> 01:53:57,680
Now brother will say a few words.
Brother...

1952
01:54:05,850 --> 01:54:08,890
All of us wish to fly.

1953
01:54:09,890 --> 01:54:11,640
But can't.
We run.

1954
01:54:12,890 --> 01:54:16,810
If even that is not possible,
atleast one should try to walk.

1955
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:18,850
Somehow one should progress.

1956
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:25,020
Because there is no
right or wrong in life.

1957
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:28,520
Greetings.

1958
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:49,310
Something is wrong.

1959
01:55:06,390 --> 01:55:08,790
The one who was with me,
died in front of me.

1960
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:10,770
Feel sorry.

1961
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:14,390
Has Napoleon died?
- How do you know?

1962
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:15,730
I am with you.

1963
01:55:15,890 --> 01:55:17,720
Won't I know if you have a problem?

1964
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:18,980
You should not know.

1965
01:55:19,230 --> 01:55:21,940
How?
- That...

1966
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:23,390
I saw it in the news.

1967
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:24,570
Why are you getting angry?

1968
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:30,721
I am not in a good mood.
Go and get ready.

1969
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:37,220
Only if you talk to me nicely
will I give you happiness.

1970
01:55:49,190 --> 01:55:52,820
Sir.
- Aren't you ready yet?

1971
01:55:53,310 --> 01:55:57,350
Hey... now if I leave you
and go, what will you do?

1972
01:55:57,560 --> 01:55:59,040
I will kill you.
Come.

1973
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:26,560
Sir.

1974
01:56:26,810 --> 01:56:28,616
The time for you to
be there is over.

1975
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:30,390
I know sir.
I will vacate.

1976
01:56:42,350 --> 01:56:44,310
Hello, what happened?
- He escaped.

1977
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:47,930
You... somehow bring him home.
I will handle.

1978
01:56:48,100 --> 01:56:49,100
I'll try.

1979
01:57:02,770 --> 01:57:04,866
Hey who are you?
You are coming from inside.

1980
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:07,206
Hey... I have been
inside for so many days.

1981
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:09,710
Security is not meant to
watch the fun outside.

1982
01:57:09,810 --> 01:57:12,116
You should also know as to
what is happening inside.

1983
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:13,140
Sorry madam.

1984
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:15,910
What happened?
- Finished.

1985
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:26,916
Brother, assignment is over.
I've asked the police to come here.

1986
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:27,940
You go to the spot.

1987
01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:29,320
Yes, I am going to the spot.

1988
01:57:50,850 --> 01:57:54,180
I was waiting for so many
years to come to this place.

1989
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:57,456
Has Thandal collection finished?

1990
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:58,480
It will get over at 7.

1991
01:57:58,730 --> 01:58:00,496
From tomorrow finish it by 4.
- Ok.

1992
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:02,366
And then kill all those
who were true to Utharan.

1993
01:58:02,390 --> 01:58:03,390
There is no one.

1994
01:58:03,940 --> 01:58:04,530
How?

1995
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:06,456
One has to be together
only to do wrong things.

1996
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:07,530
He was doing business.

1997
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:14,206
Business rivalry is there
in all the business.

1998
01:58:14,230 --> 01:58:16,860
For that to kill a nice
person is stupidity.

1999
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:18,350
Police are investigating.

2000
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:20,496
We hope they will
take proper action.

2001
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:22,956
Till then as his business
partner, it is our duty

2002
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:25,166
to take care of his
business from falling.

2003
01:58:25,190 --> 01:58:27,030
Did he trouble you a lot?
