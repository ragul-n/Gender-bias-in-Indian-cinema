1
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,335
You are at home today, right?

2
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,215
Do you have work?

3
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,430
But I have not done the dishes.

4
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,251
Here, take this.

5
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,294
What time do you have to go?

6
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,505
Twelve.

7
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,633
Twelve. I will be late today.

8
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,469
I have to go to meet Savan.

9
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,810
There is a meeting today
of the Junior Artists Association.

10
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:28,022
Jitu's men have not done any work
for an entire week.

11
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,651
The industry is not doing well these days.

12
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,779
Listen,

13
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,281
do you have any money on you?

14
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,741
How much?

15
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,787
Six hundred and seventy.

16
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,501
I have 250.

17
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,632
Okay, you can do one thing.

18
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,841
On your way,

19
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,180
give that at Patil's shop.

20
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,356
Every time he sees me,
he starts asking for money.

21
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,906
Give it to him for sure.

22
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,743
Okay, bye.

23
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,904
Here, this is the newspaper bill.

24
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,406
Last month's payment is pending.

25
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,700
Chandu said you need to pay

26
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,037
by tomorrow otherwise you
won't get the paper from next week.

27
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,025
Hey, that's cool.

28
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,113
Hey, you are here. You are quite early.

29
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,014
Has the tea guy brought tea?

30
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,932
Is it cold?

31
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,434
Hey, give it here as well.

32
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,227
He will give cold tea.

33
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,731
Hey, sir is here.

34
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,608
Fine. Ready.

35
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,762

112
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,654

113
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,781
No.

114
00:26:58,908 --> 00:26:59,868
Then?

115
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,536
I am the director.

116
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,164
Oh, sir, you are the director. Wow!

117
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,166
Sir...

118
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,172
Sir, who is the music director?

119
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,716
I am.

120
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,217
Wow.

121
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,472
Vishal too,
does his own music in his films.

122
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,102
Sir, do you have a programmer?

123
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,313
No.

124
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,773
Will you be doing that as well?

125
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,608
No.

126
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,947
I like live music.

127
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,535
These days, people do not like live music.

128
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,746
Budget too is an issue.

129
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,668
Sir, what kind of piece is this?
What is the genre?

130
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,927
Sir, who all will be playing?

131
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,350
-Where?
-In the film.

132
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,813
No one.

133
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,856
No one?

134
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,983
It's a solo.

135
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,247
You mean, other than me,

136
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,542
no one else will be playing the violin?

137
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,301

Yes.

143
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,303
Many times.

144
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:45,200
Sir, I have learned from
Pandit Kesari Shankar, in Kolkata.

145
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,871
He used to play so well.
Eastern, western.

146
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,882
Sir, my grandmother
and my uncle also used to play.

147
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,300
This belongs to them.

148
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,637
Original, duplicate, Stradivarius, 1920.

149
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,014
The tonality is so good.

150
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,683
I will play something for you, sir.

151
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,945
Sunil, Sunil Chaudhry, music director.

152
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,990
He heard me in a concert
and told me to come to Bombay.

153
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,410
And I came here soon after.

154
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,248
<i>Guruji</i> was very upset.

155
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,544
I just left and came here.

156
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,613
Sir, I like this Alfredo Company.

157
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,699
You must have heard about it?

158
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,743
What tonality, sir!

159
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:15,373

181

Will you play standing or sitting?

182
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,979
I will stand.

183
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,978
Can I get some water?

184
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,790
Let me know when you are ready.

185
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,139
Sir, won't you show me something from
the film?

186
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,725
At least, I will have some context.

187
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,769
No.

188
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:07,483
I will play the film.
And I will give you the in point.

189
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,361
What will I be playing?

190
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,453
Sir, what will I be playing?

191
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,330
What will I be playing?

192
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,667
I told you.

193
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,168
Yes.

194
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,878
But...

195
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,889
Sir, if I can look at some of the footage,
I can play better.

196
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,767
But sir, without the context
of the film...

197
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,894
I like spontaneous music.

198
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,147
And I will do only one take.

199
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,316
Only one?

200
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,902
I shoot the same way.

201
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,488
Tell me if you are ready.

202
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,878
Play something.

203
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,228
There is no music in the beginning.

204
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,231
I will give you the cue,

205
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,653
you will start at four.

206
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,448
Western?

207
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,647
-What is this?
-Quiet.

208
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,375
What?

209
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:45,172
I told that I will give you
one, two, three, four count.

210
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,803
Do you want to play or not?

211
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:54,973
I want to play, sir.

212
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,268
Weird guy.

213
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,105
Why didn't you start?

214
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,825
I don't like all this.

215
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,954
Now you know the starting point,
it will be all mechanical.

216
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,167
It will not.

217
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,335
It will not.

218
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,179
I will replay it.

219
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,724
Please start on time.

220
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,061
This time, please play.

221
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,201
Please count it.

222
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,564
Where have you been?
Your phone was switched off as well.

223
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:23,711
What happened?

224
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:30,301
Do you know,
today I played my first solo piece?

225
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:32,887
Really?

226
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,403
But, what about the payment?

227
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,287
I did not play for the money, Anita.

228
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,708
Can you believe it, a solo piece?

229
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,337
-I played for half an hour, minimum.
-Really?

230
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,880
There was no brief.

231
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,549
I played as I wished.

232
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:14,220
Do you know, where I met him?
At the station.

233
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:18,474
He came to me and asked,
"Do you play the violin?" I said, "Yes."

234
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:21,560
Then he asked,
"Have you ever played solo?"

235
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,397
I said, "Many times."
