your papers some more

173
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:13,954
Now you can go

174
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:21,995
Move aside l say!

175
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,810
Come on eat, take some

176
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,663
Nice girl, good family also

177
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,727
Mamma don't do this to me again

178
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,976
Rarely do l get a chance
to enjoy carnivals back home

179
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:23,554
Francis, who started out
as a financier with other shady business

180
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,990
Made enough money
and he is now 'Pranchi' and active in church

181
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,168
He's inviting us to dine with him

182
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,816
Enough da! Let's go home

183
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:25,813
Sure! We will, right now

184
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,652
You have to see to all this,

Jose, help yourself there's plenty

187
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,708
Hey! What sort of a host are you

188
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:51,075
Hiding yourself after
doling out local stuff!

189
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,947
Molly'echi, come on sing a song now

190
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,716
Chammidi! Give her what she wants, da!

191
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:09,029
- Meet Francis
- My cousin Colin

192
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,964
You live at Vypin?

193
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:13,832
Actually from Vypin,
but now shifted to Fort Kochi

194
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,164
Abu
Aren't you having?

195
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,242
Come on, let's make a move

196
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:22,743
Over?

197
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,711
Hey Chammidi, give these boys some more

198
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:31,947
Why the heck...?

199
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,122
Okay you carry on

200
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,718
l'll go bring mamma
Meet you at the church

201
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,660

202
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,725
Sit down
Go ahead, pour, a large is okay

203
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,780
Mamma, l want this one

204
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,287
Take something else Kevin
This is not good

205
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:05,789
Why don't you take this one

206
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,653
Mamma l want this only

207
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:15,865
There is no letter K in this
How can you buy this?

208
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,971
Each one got 8 each
See how good it looks

209
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,032
- Ah! Does it smell of liquor?
- No

210
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,775
But l didn't have any

211
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,208
What is it?
What is it man?

212
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,080
Come, come lets go

213
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,947
Hey! What's this?
What is it dude?

214
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,747
- What are you glaring for?
- Abu!

215
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,893
Hey! Come back here!

216
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,003
You!

217
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,302
Move aside you...son of a...!! !

218
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,898
Run!
Abu run!

219
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:00,901
Catch him

220
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,702
Move aside

221
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,737
Rasool! Run for it!

222
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,346
Ashley! l lost my way da

223
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:34,288
- Where's Abu and Colin?
- They ran away, are they in trouble?

224
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,059
Can't say
Those boys are trouble-makers

225
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,628
Then they must have got it bad!

226
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,932
Why did l take him home that day

227
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,636
Rasool's innocence, his fear...

228
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,140
...l liked all that

229
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,272
Be here, l'll lock it from
outside and go

230
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,179
Colin and Abu got their fill that night
that would last them for a whole year

231
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,477
lt was early morning
before l packed them home

232
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,958
- Will you have some tea, brother Vasu?
- l already had my tea

233
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:33,410
Let's go quickly
Those guys will create a ruckus

234
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:52,394
l was worried the boys who had picked up
the fight in church, would harass Rasool...

235
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,563
...so decided to go with him
in the boat to Ernakulum

236
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,223
- Hasn't Anna come?
- No, she hasn't

237
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,346
Luckily nothing
happened that day

238
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,316
But something
unforeseen happened!

239
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:56,054
This is last month's installment
You must give this month's by 15th

240
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,687
Louis, l will pay you
Let me get my pay

241
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,199
Brother, Don't untie!
Anna! Come quickly! Run!

242
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,321
Mamma?

243
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,816
Hey! l thought you were going to Kochi?

244
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,658
l have some work in Ernakulum town

245
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:09,291
Anna, where do you work now?

246
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,162
- At 'Seemas' in Ernakulum
- That's why we don't get to see you

247
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,763
Have to leave early
and return late night

248
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,668
l heard you had come

249
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,339
Okay, see you
Bye mamma

250
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,274
Boat's moving rather slowly

251
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,458
Blows in the darkness

252
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,756
Shouldn't l get a gap to return them?

253
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,226
l won't forget that fellow
who bashed up my nose

254
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:45,400
A vagabond who is only like a feather

255
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,295
Who is he?

256
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,472
- He is Kunjumon
- Who is that?

257
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,465
My neighbor Joseph'ettan's son

258
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,234
You mean that guy
living in that tiled house?

259
00:36:55,479 --> 00:37:01,941
- lkka! (husband)here, have your medicine
- Leave me alone, l don't want them

260
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,589
You better have it or you won't
be able to take any more blows

261
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:12,424
Here's water and give the rest to him
Poor chap! Look at his nose

262
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,191
Which strong man
turned your nose into this?

263
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:18,962
Didn't you get beaten up?

264
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:22,563
Of course not! l ran away, escaped
My shirt tore, this belongs to Ashley

265
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,574
- Where were you?
- Understood!

266
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,680
- Aren't you going to see your father?
- l have not gone home

267
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,442
We'll meet this evening

268
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:35,943
Colin!
Hey look!

269
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,350
There! lt's coming!

270
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,950
You go for a church carnival
and pick up fights eh?

271
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,388
And come back beaten up?

272
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,796
My God! Look at his nose!

273
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:56,937
Mamma, don't beat him any more
He's already in bad shape

274
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,680
Poor chap! Such a weakling!

275
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,450
Where are you going back
you stupid?

276
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:17,460
l have told that other guy
He says to be patient for 2 more days

277
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:25,799
Just watch me my dear, l swear
l'll get into his house and finish him off

278
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,565
We can talk it over
and compromise

279
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,266
What is there to talk?
This is not fair my boy

280
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:37,343
Police have been enquiring since ages
Do they think we are terrorists?

281
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:42,380
Aren't you agents supposed
to look after such issues?

282
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:44,946
Look into it

283
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:48,051
- Where are you off to?
- l have a trip to make

284
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,786
Eat and go da!

285
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,056
One ticket to Ernakulum

286
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,968
Sophy
lt's him

287
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:03,939
Hey! Bhai?

288
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,905
l came to meet you

289
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,779
- Where did you go?
- l went for a movie

290
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,593
Wine, its home made

291
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:22,791
No thanks, it's okay
l'll have only this

292
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,158
Leave it here mamma

293
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,640
Good night

294
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,944
lsn't anyone staying in this house?

295
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,619
Of course, all of them are there

296
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:47,782
Who is all of them?

297
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:51,353
By all of them l mean...

298
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:57,689
...Joseph'ettan
His son Kunjyumon

299
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,137
ls that middle aged woman his wife?

300
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,270
That's a distant relative

301
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,309
Who else?

302
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:12,371
Then there is Anna

303
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,255
- See you
- Goodnight

304
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:34,631
My dear, tie it a bit lower

305
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,364
- ls this enough?
- Yes

306
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,653
Okay, put out your clothes on it
l'll put it out to dry in the sun tomorrow

307
00:45:57,054 --> 00:46:05,758
<i>A pair of eyes, 2 beautiful eyes l saw</i>
<i>Right behind the pane of the door</i>

308
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:11,995
<i>A girl with eyes dark inky black blue</i>
<i>So young and fresh is she for sure</i>

309
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:17,802
<i>A pair of eyes, 2 beautiful eyes l saw</i>

310
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:29,850
<i>A pair of eyes, 2 beautiful eyes l saw</i>
<i>Right behind the pane of the door</i>

311
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:36,119
<i>A girl with eyes dark inky black blue</i>
<i>So young and fresh is she for sure</i>

312
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:39,389
<i>A pair of eyes, 2 beautiful eyes l saw</i>

313
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:08,950
<i>Cheeks like apples</i>
<i>A glance, the heart to see</i>

314
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:14,827
<i>Cheeks like apples</i>
<i>A glance, the heart to see</i>

315
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:24,204
<i>This darling treasure will soon entrap</i>
<i>Her gait, like a swan grace in every step</i>

316
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:32,841
<i>A pair of eyes, 2 beautiful eyes l saw</i>
<i>Right behind the pane of the door</i>

317
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:39,116
<i>A girl with eyes dark inky black blue</i>
<i>So young and fresh is she for sure</i>

318
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:42,522
<i>A pair of eyes, 2 beautiful eyes l saw</i>

319
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:56,907
<i>Signaling and calling out eagerly</i>
<i>Smiling with pearl white teeth showing</i>

320
00:47:57,007 --> 00:48:03,003
<i>Signaling and calling out eagerly</i>
<i>Smiling with pearl white teeth showing</i>

321
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:08,985
<i>Playful and coquettish she is all game</i>

322
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:12,146
<i>Ensnaring the heart with little sulks</i>
<i>and making up lovingly</i>

323
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:20,891
<i>A pair of eyes, 2 beautiful eyes l saw</i>
<i>Right behind the pane of the door</i>

324
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:27,233
<i>A girl with eyes dark inky black blue</i>
<i>So young and fresh is she for sure</i>

325
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:35,676
<i>A pair of eyes, 2 beautiful eyes l saw</i>

326
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:45,552
Anna

327
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:48,924
- Allah! A Christian girl?
- So what?

328
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:53,290
- lsn't she taller than you?
- No! No!

329
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,922
We are the same height l think

330
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,192
How do you know?
Did you check?

331
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,663
- Yes we did
- When was this?

332
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:04,601
Everything will be alright Hyder

333
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,372
l think my passport problem
is really serious

334
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:13,614
They are creating
problems with that old case

335
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,247
They are continuously
calling from Kuwait

336
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:19,914
lf l don't get my passport this time,
my job is gone

337
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,480
Why don't we pay them something?

338
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:22,354
For what?

339
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:24,693
We'll talk to the Sub-lnspector openly

340
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,659
You think there are police
who refuse to listen to reason?

341
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:28,725
Just come with me

342
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,941
Spent one year in a juvenile home
when 13 years old

343
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:47,215
ln the Mattancherry issue
you were jailed for suspicious activities

344
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:51,312
Also, rumoured to be
connected to a group of activists

345
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:59,723
Tell me now, can we simply
hand over his passport?

346
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:04,329
That's why we say that
we have to investigate thoroughly

347
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:09,706
You can go

348
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:25,082
- Didn't you hear what he said?
- Said what?

349
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:28,522
They'll investigate everything about you
thoroughly and then issue the passport

350
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,287
Was it for this
l brought you along here?

351
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:33,659
When you explain,
l feel you are right

352
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,460
When the police argue
l feel they are right

353
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:40,161
My dear uncle, l have not been
involved in any case for a long time

354
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:43,136
l had nothing to do with
that Mattancherry fight

355
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:46,571
lt was Salim'kka who made me
sit on the stage for that meeting

356
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:49,009
And the newspapers
took my photo, what was l to do?

357
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:52,512
l want to escape from all this
but these lunatics don't allow me

358
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,611
lf they don't give me my passport
l'll break their heads, just wait and see!

359
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:10,099
<i>Someone dear to me has sung along</i>
<i>Said the nightingale through his song</i>

360
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,495
<i>A beautiful nightingale...</i>

361
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:50,266
<i>Wonder who you are...</i>

362
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:58,646
- Should l play it?
- No

363
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,709
Didn't you give it to her?

364
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:06,319
All this is not allowed there

365
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:08,882
Who is she?

366
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,423
A family friend

367
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,192
So that's why you are
still a bachelor, eh?

368
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,469
What can you do now?
Except to forget

369
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,803
The heck! l am unable to forget

370
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:46,361
Mamma, have you finished
your shopping?

371
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:48,221
l just reached, okay?

372
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:57,831
Aren't you coming?

373
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,153
Will all of us fit in, Rasool?

374
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,629
- Sure! Another 10 of you can sit
- Then it's okay

375
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,238
- What happened?
- On leave for the afternoon

376
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:39,679
Rasool, you're A/C is not working
l'm going to open the window

377
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,783
l just got it repaired
Must be the heat outside

378
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:48,254
- Where did you guys go?
- We went to see a nun in a convent

379
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:49,986
- A nun?
- Yes

380
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,788
Ashley, who is that nun?

381
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,532
Annie, who is she?

382
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,382
We'll just step in for a minute
and come, okay?

383
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,548
- Are you coming?
- No

384
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,761
- Where did you go?
- Hm?

385
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:15,367
- l asked you where you went?
- l had to run a trip for Colin

386
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:50,062
- How much do l owe you Rasool?
- Nothing

387
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,567
- Don't you want to be paid?
- l'll collect it from Colin

388
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,642
Da, l am unable
to get in touch with Abu

389
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,413
What is it?

390
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:14,994
Send her a message
A blank message

391
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:16,562
Why?

392
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:20,491
lf anyone calls from there
you can always feign ignorance

393
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:28,573
Morning and evening send a wish
Add sweet dreams for the night

394
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,470
Send each one at that particular time

395
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:36,149
-l will go home and do it
-Why are you feeling shy?

396
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:40,085
Yes you do

Are you scared?

407
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:05,666
First time

408
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,682

Just leave her alone my dear boy
Firstly, she's a Christian

01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,441
Hyder'kka will kill you

426

- My dearest lkka?
- Yes?

427
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,913
Did l fall in love with you

01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:41,946
Love does not have caste or religion
You go ahead and love her, my dear

We'll cross the bridge
when it comes

Go early morning and return late night
Do you attend the Sunday mass also?

432
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:52,334
You don't talk about love

You are in love with all girls

Driving a vehicle all the time

01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:51,642
Hey! What happened?
Has the boat stopped?

01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:57,378
Hey boys, will l see my home again?

468
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:06,555
Something wrong with the motor,

469
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:11,499
What is to be done now?

470
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,330
Listen, the boat stopped in mid river

Be careful here, okay?
You'll lose your job

487
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:05,222
What happened dear?
Heard the boat had trouble this morning?

488
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:50,521
<i>l saw, l glimpsed a man in my dream</i>

489
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:58,573
<i>Within my heart someone l'd never seen</i>

490
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:05,136
<i>Oh poor dream of mine, please</i>
<i>Tell me, oh tell me who you did see</i>

491
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,645
Hey! Why the dot
on the forehead today?

492
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,843
lt looks really good on you

493
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:18,386
You seem to have a high fever
Go see a doctor

494
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:23,363
- lf it's Dengue, you'll be in real trouble
- This can't be that kind of a fever

495
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:25,894
What other fever
can you possibly suffer from?

496
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:54,790
<i>Row on and on to shores</i>
<i>Unseen by anyone before</i>

497
01:13:54,863 --> 01:14:04,795
<i>He is also in that flowing stream</i>
<i>Just an ordinary man, my dear dream</i>

498
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:09,437
<i>Just an ordinary man, my dear dream</i>

499
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:50,985
<i>Look, fill your eyes with the sight</i>
<i>of the sea and backwaters so far beyond</i>

500
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:53,748
<i>As l turned, drop by drop into water</i>

501
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:58,623
<i>You flowed out like</i>
<i>bay waters into the ocean</i>

502
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:04,461
<i>Flowing forever grief stricken</i>
<i>in search of shores</i>

503
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:09,868
<i>Within, my innermost self</i>
<i>you became the seven seas</i>

504
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:14,204
<i>As l turned into clear sparkling waters</i>

505
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:21,482
Go!
Go there

506
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:32,259
Kathrina...?

507
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:37,798
Oh! All of you are here

508
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,895
Are you returning after work?

509
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:45,971
When Mary told me you got a job
in a cloth store, l thought it was a high post

510
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:50,007
Do you really need this job my dear?
lsn't that right, my son?

511
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:52,944
Kathrina?

512
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:57,743
What a dignified look!

513
01:15:58,186 --> 01:16:02,782
Give me my money
and then look dignified

514
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,988
Hey! Woman! You heard me?

515
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:09,928
- Give me what you owe me, okay?
- Go away!

516
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:00,713
l got your message

517
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:03,282
- Why aren't you saying anything?
- Go away

518
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:12,590
You do like me, don't you?

519
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:15,762
Say something please

520
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:17,824
- l will
- When?

521
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:21,993
- Later
- Later when?

522
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:24,804
- Afternoon
- l'll come back in the afternoon

523
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:29,401
- No! l'll give you a call
- Will you surely?

524
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:31,979
- What is it?
- l wanted a shirt

525
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:33,810
Shirts are in the lower floor
Come with me

526
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:45,754
Has he started following you here too?
What did he say?

527
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:47,389
Nothing

528
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:19,961
- Hello
- Hello?

529
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:11,203
Terrible traffic block!

530
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:15,373
- Who was it?
- No one

531
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:18,843
- Why are you following me around?
- You didn't give me an answer

532
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:21,438
Don't come to the shop again
l will lose my job

533
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,250
- All this will not work out
- Not work out? But why?

534
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:25,953
l don't know

535
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:30,385
Say something before you go

536
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:35,259
- No, this won't work out
- l like you, that's why l came to the shop

537
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:36,991
This will not happen
the way you expect it to

538
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:38,089
Why not?

539
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,062
lt will become an issue
lt cannot happen

540
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:44,504
- Give me a reason why it wont
- You won't understand, it just won't

541
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:47,837
ls this why you asked me to come?

542
01:20:47,976 --> 01:20:50,376
- Boat jetty
- Tell me and then go

543
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:51,543
Let's go

544
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:58,343
- Why won't it work out?
- lt won't

545
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:01,617
- l am a Christian
- ls it my fault that l am a Muslim?

546
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:12,830
l drive Barath'ettan's vehicle
for my livelihood

547
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:16,462
l have had more meals
in Colin's house than my own

548
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:18,072
He's a Christian, isn't he?

549
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:30,978
At least tell me if you like me?

550
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:40,219
l am afraid

551
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:05,982
Move!

552
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:12,083
Hey brother, aren't you getting off?

553
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:40,020
What is it, dude?

554
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:13,672
She's an intelligent girl
You had to fall for a Christian girl, eh?

555
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:16,811
Just go to Ponnani
You'll get the most beautiful girls

556
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:20,453
Why go to Ponnani?
Don't we get girls in our own place?

557
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:26,288
What about Nafeesa's 2nd daughter?
She'll complete her 10th next year

558
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,726
A tedious boat trip all the way there
And then the return journey

559
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:38,805
l know why you are at that window

560
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:42,835
What is your intention?

561
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:45,376
l swear, l am serious

562
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:48,138
l am not the kind
to play around, ask Colin

563
01:24:57,792 --> 01:24:59,191
l like Anna very, very much

564
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:07,393
l understood that day, the depth
of his feelings for Anna

565
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,098
l also told Anna about this

566
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:34,118
<i>The meaning of love on this earth</i>
<i>When life gives its complete meaning</i>

567
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:47,307
<i>A realization that love is to endure</i>
<i>l witness that to love is to accept death</i>

568
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,496
- Hello
- Hello

569
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:19,799
- Tomorrow we have a place to visit
- Sure we can, but where to?

570
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:21,503
l'll tell you all that later

571
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:23,674
Hello

572
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:35,447
- We can go by my car
- No, we'll take the bus

573
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,191
Okay, see you tomorrow

574
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:51,194
Tickets

575
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:08,448
2 tickets to...

576
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:09,885
2 tickets to Kakkanad

577
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,658
What are your intentions?

578
01:29:01,135 --> 01:29:02,033
What?

579
01:29:02,904 --> 01:29:05,304
Will your family
and townsfolk approve of this?

580
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,005
l don't have a family

581
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:12,311
You will ask Anna
to convert to your religion

582
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:14,540
Why all this unnecessary complications?

583
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:16,479
Convert to my religion?
Why should l?

584
01:29:17,418 --> 01:29:19,477
l will do no such thing
and neither will she

585
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,747
l like her and she does me

586
01:29:57,125 --> 01:30:00,561
lNTERVAL

587
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:44,904
- What's happening to your Gulf trip?
- That won't work out

588
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:47,868
Do you have to go abroad
to make money?

589
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:51,076
Can't you work
with your dad in Ponnani?

590
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:53,843
All this has been told many times

591
01:31:00,888 --> 01:31:03,413
lf he has to prosper in life
first his attitude has to change

592
01:31:19,207 --> 01:31:20,196
There he comes!

593
01:31:21,242 --> 01:31:23,972
This one with a car
and the other with a Jhankar(ferry)

594
01:31:24,078 --> 01:31:25,978
Both of them have no brains

595
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:32,613
What will they earn with such petty jobs?
We can only advice isn't it?

596
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:51,870
l am finding it difficult
to manage on my own

597
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,105
Come to Ponnani if possible

598
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:57,107
- Here take this
- No, l don't want it

599
01:31:57,311 --> 01:31:58,471
Keep it my boy!

600
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:22,694
With those glasses you look
like lmran Hashmi (actor)

601
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:24,303
As long as you
don't open your mouth

602
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:31,509
- Are you asleep?
- Heavens! lt's so dark in here

603
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:42,250
Hello?

604
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:45,156
Where are you?

605
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:49,553
l am here
Can you come outside?

606
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:54,897
Look this way!
Here at the window

607
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:06,910
ls it?

608
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:18,283
Goodness!

609
01:33:19,694 --> 01:33:20,626
What happened?

610
01:33:21,162 --> 01:33:22,891
Bhai? Were you asleep here?

611
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:28,099
- Shall l go?
- Just one minute more

612
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:45,711
One minute over,
now can l leave?

613
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:47,952
Some more

614
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:52,091
The manager will kick up a fuss
Can l go now?

615
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:53,191
Okay

616
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:21,978
<i>Oh Divine mercy of God</i>
<i>Oh divine mercy of love</i>

617
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:38,034
- Give it to me
- No l'll help you

618
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:40,935
- You can go
- l'll say hello to Ashley

619
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:42,304
Ashley is not there

620
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:26,148
Why do you have
a smile today my girl?

621
01:35:36,997 --> 01:35:38,965
This is what l said

622
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:41,758
This is where we usually come

623
01:35:41,936 --> 01:35:43,369
Good collection

624
01:35:43,504 --> 01:35:44,971
You hang around till we return

625
01:35:45,172 --> 01:35:46,764
lf they call me
l'll leave, okay?

626
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:13,992
Give it to him

627
01:36:14,869 --> 01:36:15,961
What is it?

628
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:18,038
Get and come you pig

629
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:21,966
You pig

630
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:26,940
You pig...

631
01:36:28,415 --> 01:36:31,009
Look at me, you pig

632
01:36:31,085 --> 01:36:36,045
Come and hit me, you pig

633
01:36:40,427 --> 01:36:42,759
Kill those scoundrels

634
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:45,025
Rasool run!

635
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:54,006
Catch him

636
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:30,033
Rasool take the vehicle

637
01:37:30,177 --> 01:37:31,371
Run and get in

638
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:38,144
Listen to me
Kunjumon

639
01:37:38,252 --> 01:37:39,981
You don't have to say anything

640
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:43,223
How dare you hit me

641
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:48,986
Leave me

642
01:37:54,068 --> 01:37:57,970
Rasool! Don't spare anyone
Hit them all

643
01:38:04,445 --> 01:38:06,003
Let him go

644
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,485
You pig

645
01:38:24,164 --> 01:38:26,155
Come

646
01:38:41,015 --> 01:38:43,142
What about the favour l asked you?
Did you go to the police?

647
01:38:43,217 --> 01:38:44,411
Just get lost will you

648
01:38:44,551 --> 01:38:46,178
Tell me, will it succeed?

649
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:49,950
l had to spend more fuel
for these fellows of Kochi

650
01:38:50,057 --> 01:38:54,960
Mamma even started asking
if l had come home to solve their issues

651
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:59,557
What the heck did you try to achieve?
Lucky you were not killed

652
01:39:00,167 --> 01:39:05,332
They deserve it
They punched my lkka into pulp

653
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:11,569
What are you
poking at it for so long?

654
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:21,952
Rasool, let that case alone
lt won't work out, let's find someone else

655
01:39:26,527 --> 01:39:31,021
Although they did the attacking
Rasool suffered the most from this event

656
01:39:31,765 --> 01:39:33,164
Anna left him

657
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:41,505
He hung around Marine Drive and Menaka
day and night, trying to get her sympathy

658
01:39:41,608 --> 01:39:43,132
But none of his efforts succeeded

659
01:39:43,243 --> 01:39:45,040
Don't you have any better work?

660
01:39:48,615 --> 01:39:51,015
Finally he came to me

661
01:40:00,794 --> 01:40:05,197
Do something my dear Bhai
l went to the shop, Shalu drove me away

662
01:40:05,332 --> 01:40:08,358
She won't even pick up my calls
At least ask her to answer

663
01:40:08,469 --> 01:40:09,697
Even l sent her my messages

664
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:12,705
That fellow beat me, that's why l did it
He's mad, that boy

665
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:17,233
Kevin, don't touch my bike
Get down

666
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:26,517
Where in heaven did l find
the courage to do all this?

667
01:40:27,621 --> 01:40:28,588
l don't know

668
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:35,223
Love erases all fears was something
l realized when Rasool came with me

669
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:38,997
l decided to unite them

670
01:41:35,255 --> 01:41:36,085
Rasool?

671
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:37,520
Quickly, okay?

672
01:41:42,796 --> 01:41:47,699
Why didn't you take my calls?
l even sent messages

673
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:51,298
Why did you beat him?

674
01:41:51,472 --> 01:41:52,564
He beat me up, didn't he?

675
01:41:52,673 --> 01:41:56,404
My friends and ruined my car also
What kind of a boy is he?

676
01:41:57,311 --> 01:42:00,644
He is a brat
But what's wrong with you?

677
01:42:01,281 --> 01:42:03,715
Aren't you ashamed
to pick up a brawl on the streets?

678
01:42:05,686 --> 01:42:09,884
lf this is how it's going to be
l don't want to see you any more

679
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:18,621
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to go beg his forgiveness?

680
01:42:19,333 --> 01:42:20,163
Tell me Anna

681
01:42:23,604 --> 01:42:25,299
l can't stay without seeing you

682
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:40,211
You know all about me don't you?

683
01:42:42,422 --> 01:42:45,186
lt's almost 20 years
since father talked

684
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,552
You met sister, didn't you?

685
01:42:50,564 --> 01:42:55,524
Then there is Kunjumon
Hardly matters if he's there or not

686
01:42:58,338 --> 01:43:00,670
l really want to end my life

687
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:06,911
That was when l met you

688
01:43:16,523 --> 01:43:17,581
Rasool, you also...

689
01:43:52,693 --> 01:43:54,422
Hey! Leave me

690
01:44:05,472 --> 01:44:06,496
Anna!

691
01:45:48,942 --> 01:45:51,069
Go away guys!

692
01:47:15,562 --> 01:47:16,824
l came to give him some broth

693
01:47:16,897 --> 01:47:18,091
- Are you done?
- Yes

694
01:47:32,813 --> 01:47:37,682
Go to Ponnani, father had called
Don't hang around here anymore

695
01:47:38,919 --> 01:47:40,113
l am not going anywhere

696
01:47:42,055 --> 01:47:47,118
Are you mad?
Will you marry her and come here?

697
01:47:49,162 --> 01:47:51,096
Go try to make some money first

698
01:47:51,565 --> 01:47:54,193
Stand on your own 2 feet
and we'll think about this

699
01:47:56,503 --> 01:48:02,135
Live with father for some time
Make him understand, da

700
01:48:08,248 --> 01:48:11,012
lsn't it better you stay away
for sometime at least?

701
01:48:53,026 --> 01:48:58,589
Why are you sitting like this?
Love is not the end of the world

702
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:03,295
You may feel sad and now
ln a way its good

703
01:49:04,004 --> 01:49:08,304
Because otherwise
you may have to suffer

704
01:49:18,852 --> 01:49:20,911
- How much?
- Rs 40

705
01:49:22,088 --> 01:49:24,784
- Do you have change?
- Change for how much?

706
01:49:28,962 --> 01:49:29,951
Get going now!

707
01:49:35,802 --> 01:49:36,632
Come

708
01:49:47,647 --> 01:49:50,138
- Give me your bag
- Go in my boy

709
01:50:09,135 --> 01:50:10,727
Have you seen her even once?

710
01:50:10,971 --> 01:50:12,199
Well how would you?!

711
01:50:12,672 --> 01:50:14,663
You and your brother
never come here, right?

712
01:50:26,686 --> 01:50:29,211
My dear, why don't you
come and eat something?

713
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:35,287
How many days will you
stay cooped up in here like this?

714
01:51:04,724 --> 01:51:05,691
Sister?

715
01:51:07,427 --> 01:51:09,054
- Didn't you go to school today?
- No

716
01:51:09,729 --> 01:51:11,629
- What is this?
- Chocolate

717
01:51:16,302 --> 01:51:18,133
Praise be the Lord

718
01:51:18,204 --> 01:51:20,968
Father, you can sit there
Thomas?

719
01:51:21,708 --> 01:51:23,300
You sit here my boy

720
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:29,278
Hey! l didn't know
you were here my dear?

721
01:51:29,749 --> 01:51:32,946
Go inside and get us
5-6 cups of strong tea

722
01:51:39,426 --> 01:51:41,087
Praise be the Lord

723
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:46,798
Father, tell him
what we've come for

724
01:51:46,933 --> 01:51:49,959
Joseph we have come
with a marriage proposal

725
01:51:50,070 --> 01:51:54,268
Francis likes Anna
He has been saying this for some time

726
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:56,433
l thought why delay it any longer

727
01:51:56,710 --> 01:52:02,774
Both families have their shortcomings
Yet we would like to propose

728
01:52:03,416 --> 01:52:08,251
My son is once wedded
His wife is dead and he has a child too

729
01:52:08,922 --> 01:52:10,719
Everyone knows it

730
01:52:11,124 --> 01:52:15,117
Everyone knows what
is happening in this house too, right?

731
01:52:15,361 --> 01:52:17,727
Father tell them the rest of it

732
01:52:17,897 --> 01:52:22,061
Joseph, you need not worry about
the dowry in gold or the wedding expenses

733
01:52:22,869 --> 01:52:27,363
They promise to take care of all that
You just have to give your nod of assent

734
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:30,876
Father! What are you saying?
Of course Joseph will agree to this

735
01:52:31,978 --> 01:52:33,878
We must ask
her opinion also, shouldn't we?

736
01:52:34,414 --> 01:52:35,972
She will not have any objection

737
01:52:36,149 --> 01:52:39,915
You don't have to interfere
This is a family issue

738
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:42,950
Why are you
a stranger, meddling in this?

739
01:53:05,311 --> 01:53:09,145
Help yourself Father
Thomas, Anto, give it to everyone

740
01:53:17,257 --> 01:53:19,452
Trying to catch fish
in muddy waters!

741
01:53:28,268 --> 01:53:30,031
Brother, come have dinner

742
01:53:42,549 --> 01:53:45,484
- You know our Jamal, don't you?
- Yes

743
01:53:46,452 --> 01:53:50,013
He'll come early in the morning
You can start work tomorrow itself

744
01:53:51,257 --> 01:53:55,353
He's just come, isn't it?
Let the hurt on his head heal first

745
01:53:57,397 --> 01:53:59,865
Does he use his head to work?
His hands are enough

746
01:54:01,134 --> 01:54:02,328
Live as you wish

747
01:54:02,635 --> 01:54:04,262
l will go early morning tomorrow

748
01:54:17,517 --> 01:54:21,146
Hey! Get up
The boat has come, let's go

749
01:54:21,487 --> 01:54:22,511
Boat?

750
01:54:43,676 --> 01:54:48,875
<i>Who is your boat man to navigate?</i>

751
01:54:48,982 --> 01:54:58,482
<i>Where is your oar,</i>
<i>as you journey into the ocean?</i>

752
01:54:58,992 --> 01:55:04,020
<i>Who is your boat man to navigate?</i>

753
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:13,402
<i>Where is your oar,</i>
<i>as you journey into the ocean?</i>

754
01:55:13,506 --> 01:55:29,116
<i>A journey, a voyage,</i>
<i>a journey through ages</i>

755
01:55:55,648 --> 01:55:58,173
lkka?
Abu'kka?

756
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:01,444
What is this?

757
01:56:01,621 --> 01:56:03,646
- Give it to me
- What jobs are you doing?

758
01:56:05,325 --> 01:56:08,123
What is this?
What do you do to earn?

759
01:56:09,095 --> 01:56:11,563
l am scared
Don't try to fool me

760
01:56:11,664 --> 01:56:14,531
What is it you are doing
l am scared

761
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:15,624
What is it my girl?

762
01:56:18,137 --> 01:56:19,434
Why do you have to be scared?

763
01:56:19,539 --> 01:56:21,404
- l am afraid
- Why my dear?

764
01:56:24,544 --> 01:56:25,670
Why my girl?

765
01:56:44,063 --> 01:56:45,030
Da Faizi,

766
01:56:45,798 --> 01:56:46,992
What is happening?

767
01:56:47,266 --> 01:56:50,599
lt's a month and half since verification
Are you playing the fool?

768
01:56:50,737 --> 01:56:51,669
Where is my passport?

769
01:56:51,804 --> 01:56:55,535
There is no use kicking up a fuss here
Go ask those policemen

770
01:56:56,042 --> 01:56:58,306
They have written a horrible report

771
01:56:58,544 --> 01:57:03,038
Try to beg and placate them
Or you'll never go to gulf in this birth

772
01:57:03,249 --> 01:57:06,116
- Don't harass me sir
- You went to the SP office, right?

773
01:57:06,352 --> 01:57:07,979
He has put us into trouble, sir

774
01:57:09,689 --> 01:57:13,250
lt is you who give us problems
People of the town think we are thugs now

775
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:15,190
We are not sanctioned
loans from banks

776
01:57:15,828 --> 01:57:19,286
Police consider us terrorists
Don't we also have a right to live here?

777
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:22,266
Enough, come out now
Come l say

778
01:57:29,308 --> 01:57:31,742
- Give this file to the SP
- Yes sir

779
01:57:42,789 --> 01:57:44,780
- ls Abu in?
- Yes

780
01:57:46,626 --> 01:57:47,752
Someone's come for you

781
01:57:50,396 --> 01:57:52,364
Come let's go

782
01:58:08,648 --> 01:58:09,672
Shall l leave my dear?

783
01:58:17,323 --> 01:58:27,358
<i>As stars, their rays light up your path</i>
<i>The shore and bay beckons you back</i>

784
01:58:27,533 --> 01:58:37,340
<i>ln darkness, without even moonlight</i>
<i>With just a glimmer within your heart</i>

785
01:58:37,643 --> 01:58:47,450
<i>You are yourself the chosen path to journey</i>
<i>The shores to reach are within you always</i>

786
01:58:47,553 --> 01:58:57,724
<i>Hey...journey...the voyage</i>

787
01:59:11,744 --> 01:59:14,577
Hello! Are you
still dreaming of that girl?

788
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:15,610
Dreaming?

789
01:59:15,748 --> 01:59:18,774
Don't deny, lsmail'kka
has told me everything

790
01:59:19,452 --> 01:59:22,182
l know the pain
of losing the girl you love

791
01:59:22,522 --> 01:59:25,821
You don't be sad
Whenever you feel like seeing her

792
01:59:25,925 --> 01:59:30,453
Just jump in and open your eyes
She'll appear like a fish

793
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:43,474
<i>Where is your oar,</i>
<i>as you journey into the ocean?</i>

794
01:59:43,643 --> 01:59:58,957
<i>A journey, a voyage,</i>
<i>a journey through ages</i>

795
02:00:05,264 --> 02:00:06,561
- Did you get your pay?
- No

796
02:00:10,536 --> 02:00:11,798
- Here
- l don't want it

797
02:00:11,871 --> 02:00:13,702
This is wages for your labour
Accept it

798
02:00:19,579 --> 02:00:21,274
- lt's a windfall my son!
- Sure!

799
02:00:43,970 --> 02:00:44,868
Did you see her?

800
02:00:49,709 --> 02:00:53,873
ln the name The Father,
Son and the Holy Ghost

801
02:00:53,946 --> 02:00:54,776
Amen!

802
02:00:55,581 --> 02:01:01,781
Francis, are you prepared to accept
Anna as your future bride?

803
02:01:02,588 --> 02:01:03,520
Yes l am

804
02:01:05,591 --> 02:01:12,895
Anna Joseph, are you prepared to accept
Francis as your future husband?

805
02:01:18,437 --> 02:01:19,404
Yes l am

806
02:01:20,773 --> 02:01:27,679
Dear Lord, merciful and loving,
may your children rancis and Anna Joseph...

807
02:01:27,747 --> 02:01:32,047
We decide upon something
but God decrees something else

808
02:01:33,552 --> 02:01:35,884
This is what happened to me also

809
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:38,957
Lily

810
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:44,293
The love l had from 4th grade
When we were students at Delta

811
02:01:45,364 --> 02:01:46,331
One way

812
02:01:58,778 --> 02:02:02,407
When we were college mates too
l didn't tell her of my love

813
02:02:12,491 --> 02:02:15,358
But Jismon told her of his love

814
02:02:26,405 --> 02:02:28,430
l became just an onlooker

815
02:03:01,907 --> 02:03:06,105
When Jismon betrayed her
at least then l should have told her

816
02:03:07,446 --> 02:03:08,435
But...

817
02:03:12,551 --> 02:03:15,076
...my silence finally
led her to the Convent

818
02:03:20,059 --> 02:03:21,788
l gave Lily away to God

819
02:03:24,163 --> 02:03:27,724
But l decided l won't let
Anna be given away to the Devil

820
02:03:29,535 --> 02:03:31,833
l thought at least she
would escape from that house

821
02:03:35,674 --> 02:03:37,403
The wedding will be held in 15 days

822
02:03:37,877 --> 02:03:39,777
l am thinking of cancelling my leave

823
02:03:41,447 --> 02:03:44,974
Otherwise l will have to see her
walk out with that Francis

824
02:03:51,690 --> 02:03:56,753
<i>Wrap me around, hold me close</i>

825
02:03:56,929 --> 02:04:00,421
Let this phone be with you
Here keep it

826
02:04:02,868 --> 02:04:08,829
<i>Wrap me around, hold me close</i>

827
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:19,777
<i>Stories Sufi told us about</i>
<i>the wonders of love</i>

828
02:04:19,852 --> 02:04:30,592
<i>But never did they warn</i>
<i>that love also meant death</i>

829
02:04:39,472 --> 02:04:41,030
Have you brought
your woman back home?

830
02:04:41,207 --> 02:04:42,970
My mother should allow me to, right?

831
02:04:43,809 --> 02:04:46,107
Keep repeating this all the time!

832
02:04:46,846 --> 02:04:51,044
Take up more jobs for your living
Don't we get houses here?

833
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:55,482
Bring them here and live together
After that, puff up your chest and walk

834
02:04:57,156 --> 02:05:00,489
Useless fellow!
Foolish fellow

835
02:05:01,527 --> 02:05:06,055
<i>Love, the wide expanse of ocean</i>

836
02:05:06,832 --> 02:05:12,202
<i>The heart in constant danger of mishap</i>

837
02:05:13,572 --> 02:05:19,238
The ideal wife can be found by one and all
She will be purer than a gemstone

838
02:05:19,545 --> 02:05:22,946
The Lords teaches her to trust

839
02:05:23,048 --> 02:05:25,778
His gains increase

840
02:05:25,951 --> 02:05:30,115
She does him only good life long,
and never harass

841
02:05:30,723 --> 02:05:34,955
She weaves hair and jute thread into linen

842
02:05:35,261 --> 02:05:40,699
Like a traders ship,
she brings food from far

843
02:05:48,741 --> 02:05:50,732
Anna, where were you?

844
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:52,967
- l went to the bathroom
- Have some tea

845
02:05:53,145 --> 02:05:54,009
l don't want it

846
02:06:04,323 --> 02:06:06,018
Married life

847
02:06:10,262 --> 02:06:13,720
Man - Woman

848
02:06:14,934 --> 02:06:24,206
Love is most important in wedded life
Equally important is the sexual life

849
02:06:24,577 --> 02:06:26,238
lt is a divine gift

850
02:06:33,085 --> 02:06:35,076
Brother, where is
Cherupushpam School Hall?

851
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:36,551
There, that's the one

852
02:06:46,665 --> 02:06:48,997
- Sir, where is the class going on?
- Look, there

853
02:06:51,937 --> 02:06:58,809
May be as per God's will, according
to your capability, your eligibly...

854
02:06:58,877 --> 02:07:04,577
...more than expected,
you got the best partner in life

855
02:07:04,650 --> 02:07:10,384
With such conviction begin your married life
and lead a life with utmost bliss

856
02:07:10,623 --> 02:07:12,682
Sir?
May l see Anna?

857
02:07:13,292 --> 02:07:15,988
Who is Anna?
Anna, please

858
02:07:29,308 --> 02:07:32,869
As per the ability
and eligibility of each of you...

859
02:07:32,978 --> 02:07:38,883
...accept that you got
someone most compatible

860
02:07:42,321 --> 02:07:43,151
What?

861
02:07:46,825 --> 02:07:48,793
- What is it?
- l too have to go

862
02:07:53,999 --> 02:07:58,663
God is the unseen priest
who conducts this wedding

863
02:07:59,071 --> 02:08:04,202
Thereby this session teaches us
never to break this divine bond He formed

864
02:08:17,122 --> 02:08:21,991
Hey! Kunjumon
They are going away!

865
02:08:22,695 --> 02:08:27,826
Da! He's taking her away
What can l do?

866
02:08:50,222 --> 02:08:52,452
When l heard
Rasool had taken her away

867
02:08:52,725 --> 02:08:54,852
l was the one
who was overjoyed the most

868
02:09:03,802 --> 02:09:05,827
- Kozhikode
- l must get down here

869
02:09:34,867 --> 02:09:37,859
You heard what they said, didn't you?

870
02:09:40,172 --> 02:09:42,766
l can't take a decision on this,
all by myself

871
02:09:45,344 --> 02:09:49,508
You brought her away, l can't say
l will not allow her into the house

872
02:09:50,149 --> 02:10:00,218
But there are 3 girls back at home too
How can l ruin their future?

873
02:10:23,182 --> 02:10:24,342
Where are you going?

874
02:10:39,298 --> 02:10:41,323
Bharath'etta, what happened
to my request?

875
02:10:41,934 --> 02:10:43,094
Did you speak to Ani?

876
02:10:49,908 --> 02:10:51,899
Can't you stay with me?

877
02:10:59,017 --> 02:11:00,211
Yes, tell me Bharath'etta

878
02:11:01,887 --> 02:11:03,252
Give me a pen

879
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:22,439
<i>A spreading tree alongside the path</i>
<i>Enjoying the sun shine upon its being</i>

880
02:11:25,978 --> 02:11:35,046
<i>And a plant bereft of</i>
<i>shade and suffering</i>

881
02:11:37,689 --> 02:11:50,090
<i>One day, unknown to anyone,</i>
<i>came together as one</i>

882
02:11:52,905 --> 02:12:02,246
<i>One little bird</i>
<i>sprouted wings to fly</i>

883
02:12:04,683 --> 02:12:14,058
<i>Turned to this shade,</i>
<i>unknown to sunshine</i>

884
02:12:16,728 --> 02:12:23,930
<i>He came to roost on the branches</i>
<i>and the breeze played a melody</i>

885
02:12:24,002 --> 02:12:28,405
Brother, where is this address?

886
02:12:30,409 --> 02:12:31,671
l know where it is
Get in

887
02:12:55,734 --> 02:12:57,361
Come, come

888
02:12:57,469 --> 02:12:59,437
Bharathaettan said
you'd reach this morning

889
02:13:02,374 --> 02:13:04,365
You reached safely!
l am relieved

890
02:13:08,313 --> 02:13:10,247
This place does not
have many comforts

891
02:13:11,717 --> 02:13:15,084
You must be very tired
after your long journey

892
02:13:17,522 --> 02:13:19,183
Anna, take rest for some time

893
02:13:22,461 --> 02:13:24,725
Come, let's go take
a dip in the stream

894
02:13:36,074 --> 02:13:40,408
When they came to know of our affair
Rosy's father came with a knife

895
02:13:40,679 --> 02:13:44,740
We just disappeared
and came here, to Kurishupara

896
02:13:45,283 --> 02:13:48,446
Everyone here insisted
that l convert

897
02:13:48,754 --> 02:13:50,745
What did it matter?
l converted

898
02:13:51,289 --> 02:13:53,985
Purushothaman Kammath
became Peter

899
02:13:54,659 --> 02:13:56,286
Oh Lord of Seven Hills!

900
02:14:05,637 --> 02:14:07,434
What are you worrying about?

901
02:14:07,506 --> 02:14:11,602
Don't worry, just shower
and change into this

902
02:14:11,710 --> 02:14:16,647
l don't know if it will fit you
We'll get you one this evening

903
02:14:17,082 --> 02:14:19,141
Don't worry about anything, okay?

904
02:14:25,290 --> 02:14:28,487
- l wish l could get a job
- Bharath'ettan did tell me

905
02:14:28,593 --> 02:14:31,494
We'll go meet Monachan after eating our food

906
02:14:33,865 --> 02:14:35,492
Be careful walking around here

907
02:14:38,770 --> 02:14:40,601
l had asked for a house

908
02:14:41,273 --> 02:14:42,763
Let me see
l will try and get you one

909
02:15:10,302 --> 02:15:11,701
Shall l serve
some curry my dear?

910
02:15:14,506 --> 02:15:15,530
Here drink some water

911
02:15:21,813 --> 02:15:25,112
Go to the church and make
arrangements to get married

912
02:15:25,517 --> 02:15:27,280
Rasool will have to convert

913
02:15:29,488 --> 02:15:30,716
Rasool will not agree

914
02:15:31,556 --> 02:15:34,616
lf Purushotaman can turn
into Peter, so can he!

915
02:15:45,237 --> 02:15:47,398
Use this, it will be
very cold at night

916
02:16:13,165 --> 02:16:14,462
Rasool, will you convert?

917
02:16:18,570 --> 02:16:20,162
Go declare it in church(sarcastically)

918
02:16:26,211 --> 02:16:31,342
That's what Rosy chechi also says
To go to church and convert you

919
02:16:33,518 --> 02:16:36,385
- lf you don't convert nothing will happen
- Well, then let nothing happen

920
02:16:44,829 --> 02:16:47,320
Anna, you tell me
Should l convert?

921
02:16:51,469 --> 02:16:52,231
No

922
02:17:21,566 --> 02:17:23,466
Rosy, get some water

923
02:18:23,528 --> 02:18:24,756
Your eyes have reddened

924
02:18:24,996 --> 02:18:28,056
lf you open your eyes under water
You can see the person you love

925
02:18:29,968 --> 02:18:31,026
l did see

926
02:18:33,071 --> 02:18:35,596
- When?
- At Ponnani

927
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:29,992
Get down

928
02:19:45,443 --> 02:19:49,470
Colin came and told us
Abu was missing since 4-5 days

929
02:20:03,561 --> 02:20:04,789
Didn't you go today?

930
02:20:15,673 --> 02:20:17,868
- Keep this with you
- l don't want it

931
02:20:18,576 --> 02:20:19,804
Come let's have some tea

932
02:20:21,146 --> 02:20:24,582
Look who has come
Come in

933
02:20:28,486 --> 02:20:39,954
<i>With shoots newborn</i>
<i>and twigs so small</i>

934
02:20:40,432 --> 02:20:51,536
<i>Built a nest both of them</i>
<i>to live together</i>

935
02:20:52,477 --> 02:21:04,218
<i>As mist bodies were touched</i>
<i>by tender rays of sun in kisses</i>

936
02:21:04,522 --> 02:21:15,558
<i>Brightness spread</i>
<i>and light flowed in rivulets</i>

937
02:21:15,700 --> 02:21:20,933
<i>As everything turned into brightness</i>

938
02:21:21,005 --> 02:21:29,845
<i>A spreading tree alongside the path</i>
<i>Enjoying the sun shine upon its being</i>

939
02:21:32,984 --> 02:21:41,551
<i>And a plant bereft of shade</i>
<i>and suffering</i>

940
02:22:08,753 --> 02:22:10,846
Bye sister

941
02:22:44,289 --> 02:22:55,757
<i>We have only this plant</i>
<i>and this tree hereafter</i>

942
02:22:55,900 --> 02:23:07,710
<i>To rest every night on skies,</i>
<i>turn into clouds</i>

943
02:23:08,179 --> 02:23:19,818
<i>Like the showers of</i>
<i>rain on fresh earth</i>

944
02:23:19,958 --> 02:23:31,802
<i>Today, let it flow out,</i>
<i>may it rain in bountiful showers</i>

945
02:23:31,903 --> 02:23:37,967
<i>Come both, the tree</i>
<i>and the plant to be together</i>

946
02:24:36,768 --> 02:24:38,998
Anna?

947
02:25:35,059 --> 02:25:36,219
Wait, Thomas
l am coming too

948
02:25:58,449 --> 02:25:59,507
Rasool?

949
02:26:00,518 --> 02:26:01,815
- Are you Rasool?
- Yes

950
02:26:04,522 --> 02:26:06,251
- Come
- Where?

951
02:26:07,325 --> 02:26:09,759
- Come
- Walk man

952
02:26:09,961 --> 02:26:11,292
- What is it sir?
- Come man

953
02:26:12,263 --> 02:26:13,457
- What's the problem?
- Come

954
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,059
- What is it sir, tell me
- You just come with us

955
02:26:18,369 --> 02:26:20,234
Anthony sir this is the guy

956
02:26:24,375 --> 02:26:25,364
Do you know him?

957
02:26:26,077 --> 02:26:27,738
Sir, he is my friend Abu

958
02:26:28,546 --> 02:26:31,538
- Get into the vehicle
- Why? l have not done anything

959
02:26:31,849 --> 02:26:35,285
- Sir let me at least call my wife
- Your wife my foot!

960
02:26:35,353 --> 02:26:39,756
- Get in l say
- Sir, please listen

961
02:27:17,595 --> 02:27:20,029
My dear drink
some water at least

962
02:27:37,315 --> 02:27:38,043
You!

963
02:27:58,502 --> 02:27:59,969
Sir what happened to Abu?

964
02:28:01,505 --> 02:28:04,065
He's dead
Killed

965
02:28:06,444 --> 02:28:09,277
You, along with him and
some friends committed it, didn't you?

966
02:28:09,480 --> 02:28:11,141
l don't know anything sir

967
02:28:11,215 --> 02:28:14,150
Don't try to fool me okay
l'll just throw you into the ravines

968
02:28:14,318 --> 02:28:17,082
They went in your car that day
lsn't it?

969
02:28:26,230 --> 02:28:28,562
Someone killed Abu

970
02:28:31,235 --> 02:28:38,607
An act of bravado any ordinary man
of Mattancherry usually would do...

971
02:28:39,243 --> 02:28:41,575
...cost Abu his life

972
02:31:04,422 --> 02:31:10,019
Everything was going on fine

973
02:31:10,561 --> 02:31:12,722
lt was that fellow who messed it up,
your friend Abu...!

974
02:31:14,131 --> 02:31:18,329
They took care of him
and put us behind bars!

975
02:31:18,636 --> 02:31:22,197
At the most 4 months
You don't worry

976
02:31:35,519 --> 02:31:37,783
- Where is Anna?
- What is it?

977
02:31:38,255 --> 02:31:39,222
Read it

978
02:31:39,457 --> 02:31:41,220
The news papers
carry photo also

979
02:31:42,827 --> 02:31:43,623
See?

980
02:31:46,697 --> 02:31:48,187
You trusted him
and walked out didn't you?

981
02:31:48,699 --> 02:31:50,633
Now in newspapers
with a photo too

982
02:31:51,735 --> 02:31:57,867
l may have money and may cheat
But l don't kill people

983
02:32:03,247 --> 02:32:10,346
l don't have a problem because
she walked out with him,...

984
02:32:10,554 --> 02:32:11,714
...it's my 2nd marriage too, isn't it?

985
02:32:14,458 --> 02:32:16,323
lf all of you are okay with it

986
02:32:16,427 --> 02:32:18,418
Let the marriage take place
on the day we had already decided

987
02:32:38,182 --> 02:32:43,119
<i>lllegal money</i>
<i>Youth stabbed to death</i>

988
02:33:22,860 --> 02:33:27,593
<i>My divinely beautiful one,</i>
<i>your loveliness</i>

989
02:33:27,965 --> 02:33:30,433
<i>beautifying the magnificence of moonlight</i>

990
02:33:30,834 --> 02:33:36,704
<i>The shore across celebrates</i>
<i>your wedding</i>

991
02:33:39,276 --> 02:33:51,245
<i>On this shore, lay our love</i>
<i>in stillness of death</i>

992
02:33:52,623 --> 02:33:57,754
l have arranged an advocate
You can come out without much fuss

993
02:33:58,562 --> 02:34:00,189
Don't worry, l'll be there

994
02:34:02,933 --> 02:34:03,729
Anna?

995
02:34:04,668 --> 02:34:05,396
Anna?!

996
02:34:05,469 --> 02:34:07,960
She's getting married tomorrow

997
02:34:38,369 --> 02:34:41,429
ln the name of the Father
Son the Holy Ghost

998
02:34:41,505 --> 02:34:42,301
Amen

999
02:35:06,664 --> 02:35:09,030
- Shall l give the sweet to the bride?
- Say it with conviction

1000
02:35:09,733 --> 02:35:11,894
- Shall l give her the sweet?
- Louder

1001
02:35:12,770 --> 02:35:15,364
- Shall l give the sweet to the bride?
- Give it!

1002
02:36:49,166 --> 02:36:50,758
Why don't you sleep?

1003
02:37:51,795 --> 02:37:54,059
Are you a bridegroom getting ready?

1004
02:38:35,038 --> 02:38:37,768
- Let me go to the bathroom
- Wait let me finish eating

1005
02:38:42,212 --> 02:38:45,704
You want anything else?
Nothing

1006
02:38:46,817 --> 02:38:48,250
What about you
Give me some milk pancake

1007
02:38:52,256 --> 02:38:53,223
Come

1008
02:44:28,992 --> 02:44:35,329
This time apart from mamma
another person too, is awaiting my arrival

1009
02:44:36,666 --> 02:44:42,161
l confessed to Lilly the secret
l was carrying in my heart

1010
02:44:43,039 --> 02:44:45,906
She too had wanted to hear it

1011
02:44:49,980 --> 02:44:55,543
Colin married a nurse
Now they are in the UK

1012
02:44:56,453 --> 02:45:00,617
With Abu gone, Fazila had to take up
many more responsibilities

1013
02:45:06,196 --> 02:45:13,329
Hyder still has not got his passport
He never complains about it any more

1014
02:45:15,205 --> 02:45:19,665
And Rasool?
Where was he?

1015
02:45:24,114 --> 02:45:25,081
No one knew

1016
02:45:46,136 --> 02:45:56,102
<i>Wrap me around, hold me close</i>

1017
02:45:57,314 --> 02:46:07,918
<i>Wrap me around, hold me close</i>

1018
02:46:09,225 --> 02:46:14,390
<i>Stories Sufi told us about</i>
<i>the wonders of love</i>

1019
02:46:14,497 --> 02:46:21,369
<i>But never did they warn</i>
<i>that love also meant death</i>

1020
02:46:23,440 --> 02:46:28,343
<i>Wrap me around, hold me close</i>

1021
02:46:29,212 --> 02:46:40,180
<i>Wrap me around, hold me close</i>

1022
02:46:40,256 --> 02:46:45,751
<i>Days and nights in this world where</i>
<i>Waves of danger rise up and thrash</i>

1023
02:46:45,996 --> 02:46:56,429
<i>Love, the wide expanse of ocean</i>
<i>The heart in constant danger of mishap</i>

1024
02:46:57,007 --> 02:47:05,210
<i>Wrap me around, hold me close</i>
