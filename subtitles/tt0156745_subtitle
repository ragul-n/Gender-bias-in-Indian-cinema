I dOn't believe it tOO,

00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:10,927
- DOn't talk nOnsense!

251
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,519

But there is sOmething
called humanity, Mr. Ranjeet.

523
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:23,162
Even enemies dOn't behave
like this with their guests.

524
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:24,596
But nO matter.

525
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:26,878

If it hadn't been

Then you wOuldn't have been here.

Mr. Mehra, the dOctOrs clearly

But I had a physician friend.

She said, mix the
juice Of apple in milk..

731
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:29,245
And let her dink it,
she will be fine again.

732
00:46:29,967 --> 00:46:33,676
Mr. Mehra, I let her
drink it and she was fine.

733
00:46:35,367 --> 00:46:37,437
Since then he became my friend.

734
00:46:38,367 --> 00:46:42,440
Really dear, whenever I
see the apple, I feel that..

735
00:46:42,527 --> 00:46:46,918
If it hadn't been fOr my friend.

'If he finds Out the truth,

"It is sO tOrmenting my belOved,

1131
01:09:28,727 --> 01:09:34,563
"I dOn't mind if you

1132
01:09:34,647 --> 01:09:40,563
"But dOn't try tO fOrget me."

01:09:40,647 --> 01:09:46,244
"I might die in yOur lOve."

1134

"DOn't try tO test me."

1135
01:09:52,447 --> 01:09:55,917
"In yOur lOve.."

1136
01:10:00,847 --> 01:10:02,883
NO, nO that cannOt happen.

1137
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:05,086
I will nOt let that happen.

1138

WhO is trOubling..

1139
01:10:12,367 --> 01:10:14,676
SO have you
succeeded in yOur mOtive?

1140

I cannOt dO this anymOre.

1141

Leave! What dO you mean?

1143

I cannOt run behind him anymOre.

1144
01:10:25,007 --> 01:10:27,999
Because he never talks
abOut the jewellery exhibitiOn.

1145
01:10:28,087 --> 01:10:29,361
YOu didn't try yOur best.

1146
01:10:29,447 --> 01:10:30,516
That's wrOng.

1147
01:10:30,687 --> 01:10:32,837
I am very far-sighted Anju.

1148
01:10:33,767 --> 01:10:35,678
If that's wrOng, then
you will have tO prOve it.

1149
01:10:35,767 --> 01:10:36,995
There is Only One way.

That you wOn't leave Ranjeet.

1151
01:10:40,367 --> 01:10:42,005
YOu will assure him Of yOur lOve.

1152
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:45,677
- And if required, you will dO everything.
- NO, nO.

Our sleep has been ruined.

1384
01:31:34,367 --> 01:31:36,722

1476

- Actually..
- I am nOt ready tO hear anything.

1477
01:41:40,142 --> 01:41:41,336
What are you all lOOking at?

1478
01:41:42,262 --> 01:41:44,038
Keep a clOse watch On the
railway statiOn, bus depOt..

1479
01:41:44,062 --> 01:41:46,815
And airpOrt. We
must find the culprits!

1480
01:42:04,342 --> 01:42:06,333
First Of all, I
cOuldn't get the jewellery.

1481
01:42:06,422 --> 01:42:08,982
And this shOw is such an evidence..

1482
01:42:09,062 --> 01:42:11,576
It can make me rOt
in jail all my life.

1483
01:42:11,822 --> 01:42:13,335
I will destrOy it.

1484
01:42:13,502 --> 01:42:14,821

- COme On.
- BOss, why dOn't we infOrm the pOlice!

1486
01:42:17,822 --> 01:42:19,574
If we cOuldn't get Out hands On it.

1487
01:42:19,742 --> 01:42:21,334
Then he shOuldn't keep it either.

1488
01:42:21,422 --> 01:42:24,812
YOu fOOl, will you ever talk sense.

1489
01:42:25,342 --> 01:42:27,060
We can deal with Ranjeet anytime.

1490
01:42:27,342 --> 01:42:29,038
But if the pOlice get
their hands On the jewellery..

1491
01:42:29,062 --> 01:42:31,496
Then whO will bring
it frOm there, will you!

01:42:31,822 --> 01:42:33,221
Burn the shOe, you scOundrel!

01:42:37,142 --> 01:42:40,657
Drink it! Drink sOme mOre GOpinath.

1494
01:42:41,822 --> 01:42:44,814
There is nO Other reasOn

1495
01:42:45,262 --> 01:42:46,331
Drink it.

1496
01:42:46,582 --> 01:42:51,656
- Baba.
- Ranjeet, gOOd that you have cOme.

1497
01:42:51,982 --> 01:42:54,052
NOw the bOth Of us

1498
01:42:54,422 --> 01:42:57,414
Tell me, will you drink

01:42:57,982 --> 01:42:59,342
NO, I wOn't let you drink anymOre.

01:43:00,222 --> 01:43:01,814
What have you dOne tO yOurself!

01:43:02,062 --> 01:43:05,737
I have been like

01:43:06,222 --> 01:43:08,656
But nO One is at faulty fOr this.

1503

As you sOw, sO shall you reap!

1504
01:43:11,502 --> 01:43:13,333
That's what I want tO knOw.

1505
01:43:13,422 --> 01:43:15,572
Why are you sO sad? Why
are you drinking sO much?

1506
01:43:15,742 --> 01:43:17,414
What will you dO knOwing it?

1508
01:43:20,342 --> 01:43:22,060
I will lighten yOur burden.

1509
01:43:23,262 --> 01:43:24,382
Tell me, what is the matter.

1510
01:43:25,062 --> 01:43:26,131

Read it.

01:43:47,062 --> 01:43:48,654
It is a very jOyful matter baba.

1515
01:43:49,222 --> 01:43:51,417
YOur daughter is getting
married in a gOOd family.

1516
01:43:52,262 --> 01:43:53,490
What mOre dO you want?

1517
01:43:53,982 --> 01:43:55,813
YOu are right!

1518
01:43:56,342 --> 01:43:57,980
But hOw will it happen.

1519
01:43:58,742 --> 01:44:02,052
But there cannOt be a relatiOn
between a king and a beggar.

1520
01:44:03,142 --> 01:44:06,976
.I have wOrsened
the matter by lying.

1521
01:44:07,422 --> 01:44:09,333
- By lying.
- Yes.

1522
01:44:10,582 --> 01:44:12,254
It is a lOng stOry.

1523
01:44:13,662 --> 01:44:15,812
15 years agO.

1524
01:44:16,342 --> 01:44:17,661
I wasn't like this.

1525
01:44:19,342 --> 01:44:21,219
I had a gOOd family.

1526
01:44:22,502 --> 01:44:24,333
A very nice wife.

1527
01:44:25,502 --> 01:44:26,571
TwO children.

1528
01:44:27,422 --> 01:44:30,971
A girl, Rupa and the Other MOhan.

1529
01:44:32,662 --> 01:44:34,573
I lOved MOhan a lOt.

1530
01:44:36,222 --> 01:44:41,421
One day, One Of his
classmates killed him.

1531
01:44:42,822 --> 01:44:47,976
His mOther cOuldn't
tOlerate this shOck ..

1532
01:44:48,062 --> 01:44:53,341
And I died.

1533
01:44:55,742 --> 01:45:00,657
I lOst my senses
seeing bOth Of them dead.

1534
01:45:01,982 --> 01:45:03,973
I started hating that city.

1535
01:45:05,262 --> 01:45:08,971
I left my jOb at the bank..

1536
01:45:09,062 --> 01:45:11,974
And started wandering with Rupa

1537
01:45:14,062 --> 01:45:16,417
NOw Rupa was my Only suppOrt.

1538
01:45:18,142 --> 01:45:22,818
I was always wOrried, that
what will happen tO Rupa?

1539
01:45:22,982 --> 01:45:24,210
What will happen tO Rupa?

1540
01:45:25,742 --> 01:45:29,257
Then I got her admitted
tO a gOOd bOarding schOOl.

1541
01:45:29,982 --> 01:45:33,054
SO that she dOesn't have tO
face the same fate as mine.

1542
01:45:34,742 --> 01:45:36,221
Rupa wOuld study there.

1543
01:45:36,982 --> 01:45:39,974
And I wOuld tOil day and night..

1544
01:45:40,062 --> 01:45:43,134
And send her mOre
mOney then my status.

1545
01:45:45,342 --> 01:45:49,335
Until Rupa was small,
everything was fine.

1546
01:45:50,662 --> 01:45:53,972
But when she grew up,
I never tOld her..

1547
01:45:54,062 --> 01:45:57,816
That she is the
daughter Of a pOOr father.

1548
01:45:59,502 --> 01:46:01,140
I wOuld always lie tO her.

1549
01:46:02,822 --> 01:46:04,255
That I am a very rich man.

1550
01:46:04,422 --> 01:46:06,982
I have bungalOws, I have cars..

1551
01:46:07,062 --> 01:46:10,338
And I am the Owner
Of a very big hOtel.

1552
01:46:11,982 --> 01:46:14,132
Just sO that she
is nOt heart brOken.

1553
01:46:16,502 --> 01:46:18,970
AIOng with Rupa, the
peOple arOund her..

1554
01:46:19,062 --> 01:46:21,735

Mr. Mehra wants tO make my
daughter his daughter-in-law.

1557
01:46:31,222 --> 01:46:37,331
But he dOesn't knOw that

1558

I wish.. my MOhan

All Of you will take

And exactly like a family.

AbsOlutely like family.

1705
01:54:06,742 --> 01:54:11,497
This is the specialty in Our cOuntry
that we adjust wherever we gO.

1706
01:54:11,982 --> 01:54:13,973
COme On, I will
intrOduce you tO Mr. GOpinath.

1707
01:54:14,342 --> 01:54:16,810

01:54:25,062 --> 01:54:26,654
FrOm Kathmandu and Jaipur.

1712
01:54:27,342 --> 01:54:30,140
SOme Of them are
criminals and sOme are wanted.

1713
01:54:30,502 --> 01:54:33,335
All Of them have a
pOlice recOrd, sir.

1714
01:54:33,982 --> 01:54:36,496
But the reasOn Of cOming
tO Mumbai On the same day?

1715
01:54:36,822 --> 01:54:37,971
It is pOssible sir.

1716
01:54:38,062 --> 01:54:40,462
They might have a cOnnectiOn
with the theft Of the jewellery.

1717
01:54:41,222 --> 01:54:42,337
POssible.

1718

We are keeping a
clOse watch On them.

01:54:47,662 --> 01:54:48,731
That's nOt all.

1722
01:54:49,222 --> 01:54:50,416
Let me speak tO the D.I. G.

1723
01:54:52,502 --> 01:54:53,651
YOu scOundrels have arrived.

Ranjeet will hide thOse

01:55:15,582 --> 01:55:17,812
But bOss, if the

01:59:11,702 --> 01:59:17,459
"He wOuld immerse me in his eyes ..

1766
01:59:17,542 --> 01:59:22,457
And take me away."

1767
01:59:23,182 --> 01:59:26,094

But you are surprised..

1774

As if you have seen the
pOlice fOr the first time.

1775
02:00:06,462 --> 02:00:08,851
NO sir, I have Old
relatiOn with the pOlice.

1776
02:00:08,942 --> 02:00:10,678
Why wOuld I be surprised?

But sir I have tO attend Mr.

The marriage will cOmmence

02:00:17,982 --> 02:00:20,450

1787
02:00:33,542 --> 02:00:36,534
But we are nOw the
guests Of the pOlice.

1788
02:00:36,622 --> 02:00:38,021
Just see Our fate.

1789
02:00:38,102 --> 02:00:40,252
This is the divine play Of the LOrd.

1790
02:00:40,782 --> 02:00:42,932
- If you mix sugar, it dissOlves.
- YOu are right.

1791
02:00:43,622 --> 02:00:45,135
See that, he has cOme tOO.

1792
02:00:45,302 --> 02:00:46,451
COme, welcOme.

1793
02:00:46,862 --> 02:00:48,739
Only you were missing in this grOup.

1794
02:00:49,302 --> 02:00:51,896
FOrgive me friends,
I was a bit late.

1795
02:00:52,262 --> 02:00:54,776
The jeep got punctured On the way.

1796
02:00:55,462 --> 02:00:57,612
- GOOd evening inspectOr.
- GO inside.

1797
02:00:57,702 --> 02:00:58,930
Why are you pushing?

1798
02:00:59,022 --> 02:01:00,819
What if I break a bOne?

1799
02:01:00,902 --> 02:01:03,336
If you speak English in the lOckup,
you will be pushed.

1800
02:01:05,902 --> 02:01:07,938
InspectOr sir! InspectOr sir!

1801
02:01:08,462 --> 02:01:09,622
Why have I been brOught here?

1802
02:01:09,862 --> 02:01:11,118
TOday is my daughter's marriage.

1803
02:01:11,142 --> 02:01:12,278
The wedding
prOcessiOn is abOut tO arrive.

1804
02:01:12,302 --> 02:01:14,611
If I am nOt present their,
I will be ruined.

1805
02:01:14,702 --> 02:01:16,772
InspectOr sir, I haven't
dOne anything all my life.

1806
02:01:16,862 --> 02:01:17,998
I have nOt cOmmitted any crime.

1807
02:01:18,022 --> 02:01:19,091
I am innOcent.

1808
02:01:19,182 --> 02:01:21,382
Every persOn that cOmes in
the pOlice statiOn says that.

1809
02:01:21,702 --> 02:01:23,977
But inspectOr sir, what is my crime?

1810
02:01:24,342 --> 02:01:25,457
COme here.

1811
02:01:25,702 --> 02:01:26,771
COme On.

1812
02:01:28,062 --> 02:01:29,131
DO you recOgnise them?

1813
02:01:29,542 --> 02:01:30,736
Yes, I recOgnise them.

1814
02:01:30,822 --> 02:01:32,938
They are guests in my
daughter's marriage.

1815
02:01:33,622 --> 02:01:35,533
Then that's yOur fault.

1816
02:01:35,822 --> 02:01:37,302
- COnstable.
- Yes sir. - LOck him up.

1817
02:01:37,982 --> 02:01:40,450
I am sOrry yOung man,
I cannOt help you.

1818
02:01:41,462 --> 02:01:42,690
The pOlice have their Own way.

1819
02:01:43,462 --> 02:01:45,182
If they are innOcent,
they will be released.

1820
02:01:45,702 --> 02:01:47,533
But after the entire interrOgatiOn.

1821
02:01:48,062 --> 02:01:50,018
That will take many
days cOmmissiOner sir.

1822
02:01:50,462 --> 02:01:51,611
The auspiciOus day is tOday.

1823
02:01:52,662 --> 02:01:54,222
It is the questiOn
Of GOpinath's hOnOur.

1824
02:01:54,262 --> 02:01:56,173
GOpinath is the mOst suspected One.

1825
02:01:56,982 --> 02:01:59,257
Can I ask what
relatiOn dO you have with him.

1826
02:02:01,062 --> 02:02:04,134
He is like.. my father.

1827
02:02:04,862 --> 02:02:07,102
In the view Of the pOlice
and the law, it hOlds nO value.

1828
02:02:07,742 --> 02:02:11,451
All the peOple taking part in
GOpinath's daughters marriage..

1829
02:02:11,542 --> 02:02:13,022
They are all in the pOlice's view.

1830
02:02:13,702 --> 02:02:16,011
But you shOuldn't think
like that abOut Mr. GOpinath.

1831
02:02:16,902 --> 02:02:19,860
COmmissiOner sir, I knOw him
very well. He is a GOdly man.

1832
02:02:20,262 --> 02:02:21,518
Then what cOnnectiOn
dOes this GOdly man have..

1833
02:02:21,542 --> 02:02:23,180
With all these peOple?

1834
02:02:24,262 --> 02:02:27,971
HOw did a apple vendOr
becOme such a rich man?

1835
02:02:28,622 --> 02:02:30,772
And his daughter is
getting married sO grandly.

1836
02:02:32,342 --> 02:02:34,253
I am respOnsible fOr that,
cOmmissiOner sir.

1837
02:02:36,462 --> 02:02:38,214
I cOnsider that girl as my sister.

1838
02:02:39,662 --> 02:02:41,459
And as a brOther, I want tO shOwer..

1839
02:02:41,542 --> 02:02:44,693
All the happiness
Of the wOrld On her.

1840
02:02:45,302 --> 02:02:47,452
Mr. Ranjeet, this is
yOur persOnal matter.

1841
02:02:48,262 --> 02:02:51,174
NOne Of yOur arguments can
make me OverlOOk my duty.

1842
02:02:51,462 --> 02:02:53,453
YOu are wasting my
time alOng with yOurs.

1843
02:02:53,782 --> 02:02:56,535
SOrry sir! But you
are wasting my time!

1844
02:02:57,742 --> 02:02:59,858
Just One hOur remains
fOr the auspiciOus time.

1845
02:03:00,662 --> 02:03:03,460
HOw can a father nOt take
part in her daughter's marriage?

1846
02:03:04,462 --> 02:03:06,453
Think abOut it, whO
will welcOme the guests..

1847
02:03:06,542 --> 02:03:08,462
WhO will perfOrm the
giving away Of the bride?

1848
02:03:08,942 --> 02:03:11,581
COmmissiOner sir,
please release Mr. GOpinath.

1849
02:03:12,182 --> 02:03:13,582
Otherwise this marriage will break.

1850
02:03:13,942 --> 02:03:15,978
And an innOcent girl
will be heartbrOken.

1851
02:03:16,542 --> 02:03:18,772
A helpless father
will give up his life.

1852
02:03:20,222 --> 02:03:22,577
And I will never let that happen.

1853
02:03:23,062 --> 02:03:24,131
What dO you mean?

1854
02:03:24,822 --> 02:03:25,891
I mean it sir!

1855
02:03:26,822 --> 02:03:29,211
I wOn't leave withOut
taking Mr. GOpinath alOng.

1856
02:03:54,902 --> 02:03:56,096
There.. there they cOme.

1857
02:03:56,262 --> 02:03:57,331
The grOOm has arrived.

1858
02:04:44,182 --> 02:04:45,661
Anil, what's this?

1859
02:04:46,102 --> 02:04:47,171
YOu are nOt drinking!

02:04:47,262 --> 02:04:48,536

02:04:55,222 --> 02:04:56,291
It's nOt gOOd.

1865
02:04:56,382 --> 02:04:57,542
Bring a dOuble fOr Mr. Mehra.

1866
02:05:03,662 --> 02:05:06,017
Vijay, I never saw
such arrangements ever.

1867
02:05:06,102 --> 02:05:07,535
The party is sO grand.

1868
02:05:08,182 --> 02:05:10,821
It seems like a king's party.

1869
02:05:14,062 --> 02:05:18,692
I feel Mr. GOpinath
must have at least 50 lakh.

1870
02:05:18,782 --> 02:05:20,818
50 lakh! Talk abOut crOres.

1871
02:05:21,062 --> 02:05:22,518
I think, Mr. GOpinath
dOesn't knOw himself..

1872
02:05:22,542 --> 02:05:24,692
HOw much mOney he has.

1873
02:05:24,942 --> 02:05:26,342
The daughter is very fOrtunate tOO.

1874
02:05:26,622 --> 02:05:27,691
Everything belOngs tO her.

1875
02:05:27,782 --> 02:05:28,942
She dOesn't have any sibling.

1876
02:05:34,022 --> 02:05:36,741
SOrry sir, juniOr
sir has Ordered nOt tO.

1877
02:05:37,302 --> 02:05:38,451
Take care Of Other guests.

1878

Thank you sir.

1881
02:06:40,982 --> 02:06:45,260
'I feel Mr. GOpinath
must have at least 50 lakh. '

1882
02:06:46,862 --> 02:06:48,454
50 lakh!

1883
02:06:49,142 --> 02:06:53,021
SOmetimes I dOn't even
have mOney tO buy 50 apples.

1884
02:06:53,582 --> 02:06:56,096
And he talks abOut 50 lakhs.

1885
02:06:57,582 --> 02:06:59,174
BOss, it is time fOr the marriage.

1886
02:06:59,542 --> 02:07:01,342
The priest is calling
the bride and the grOOm.

1887
02:07:01,982 --> 02:07:03,256
- Mr. Mehra.
- Yes.

1888
02:07:03,342 --> 02:07:04,661

1889
02:07:04,742 --> 02:07:05,936
- I will bring Rupa.
- Fine.

1890
02:07:06,182 --> 02:07:08,262
But where is Mr. GOpinath,
I cannOt see him anywhere.

02:07:09,462 --> 02:07:10,902
YOu carry On I will see where he is.

02:07:16,062 --> 02:07:18,781
I want tO say
sOmething befOre the marriage.

1895
02:07:22,622 --> 02:07:27,173
Mr. Mehra, I am nOt
what you think I am.

1896
02:07:28,062 --> 02:07:30,053
I am nOt a rich man.

1897
02:07:30,462 --> 02:07:33,454
I am a very simple man,
an apple vendOr..

1898
02:07:33,542 --> 02:07:36,534
And I live On the streets.

1899
02:07:36,942 --> 02:07:39,058
Baba, what has happened tO you,
what are you saying?

1900
02:07:39,862 --> 02:07:42,171
It is right tO say the truth.

1901
02:07:42,582 --> 02:07:45,176
Mr. Mehra, I am telling the truth.

1902
02:07:45,622 --> 02:07:47,692
There is a burden On my heart.

1903
02:07:47,782 --> 02:07:52,458
Until I dOn't lighten that,
I wOn't find peace.

1904
02:07:53,462 --> 02:07:55,293
This bungalOw dOesn't belOng tO me.

1905
02:07:55,462 --> 02:07:58,215
Everything here isn't mine.

1906
02:07:58,982 --> 02:08:01,974
Everything belOngs tO Ranjeet.

1907
02:08:02,782 --> 02:08:06,457
I dOn't knOw what
favOur he is repaying.

1908
02:08:07,262 --> 02:08:10,777
Years agO, he suppOrted me.

1909
02:08:11,222 --> 02:08:15,101
He gave me a place Outside
his hOtel tO sell apples.

1910
02:08:15,622 --> 02:08:19,251
And tOday.. he is hiding my pOverty.

1911
02:08:19,462 --> 02:08:21,612
SO that my daughter gets married.

1912
02:08:22,062 --> 02:08:25,054
But I wOn't keep anyOne in the dark.

1913
02:08:25,742 --> 02:08:27,937
I am a very pOOr man.

1914
02:08:28,022 --> 02:08:33,016
I dOn't Own any hOtel,
any mill Or factOry.

1915
02:08:33,862 --> 02:08:37,218
My prOperty is just a apple basket.

1916
02:08:40,302 --> 02:08:44,454
Mr. Mehra, I tOld
you want I wanted tO.

1917
02:08:45,102 --> 02:08:46,660
NOw it is yOur decisiOn.

1918
02:08:46,862 --> 02:08:49,251
Whether you want tO make my
Rupa yOur daughter-in-law.

1919
02:08:49,342 --> 02:08:51,342
Or dO you want tO take the
wedding prOcessiOn back.

1920
02:08:51,462 --> 02:08:52,975
GOOd! GOOd! Very gOOd!

1921
02:08:53,062 --> 02:08:56,532
What a lOng speech!

1922
02:08:57,022 --> 02:08:59,252
If you want tO say
anything else, then say it.

1923
02:08:59,942 --> 02:09:02,012
Seems like you didn't
drink the entire bOttle tOday.

1924
02:09:02,102 --> 02:09:03,902
Otherwise he wOuld have
given a bigger speech.

1925
02:09:04,542 --> 02:09:06,021
Actually it is his Old habit.

1926
02:09:06,102 --> 02:09:08,741
After drinking, sOmetimes he
talks abOut buying Mumbai city.

1927
02:09:09,262 --> 02:09:10,662
And sOmetimes calls himself beggar.

1928
02:09:10,782 --> 02:09:12,010
I knOw that Mr. Ranjeet!

1929
02:09:12,462 --> 02:09:13,656
That's his greatness.

1930
02:09:14,462 --> 02:09:17,693
He was saying I want
tO buy Agra's Taj Mahal.

1931
02:09:18,182 --> 02:09:19,456
But nO One is ready tO sell it.

1932
02:09:20,622 --> 02:09:21,850
HOw nice, sir.

1933
02:09:22,462 --> 02:09:25,022
Mr. GOpinath, cOme On the
auspiciOus time is passing away.

1934
02:09:25,462 --> 02:09:27,453
- All Of you carry On, I will bring Rupa.
- Fine.

1935
02:09:28,022 --> 02:09:29,091
COme sOn.

1936
02:09:45,062 --> 02:09:50,090
Surprising, all my life I
lied and everyOne believed it.

1937
02:09:50,702 --> 02:09:53,535
TOday I am telling the truth,
but nO One believes it.

1938
02:10:44,942 --> 02:10:48,935
Really Mr. GOpinath, this
marriage has made me prOud.

1939
02:10:49,462 --> 02:10:51,657
Mr. Mehra, dOn't say that.

1940
02:10:52,542 --> 02:10:53,611
I am nOt wOrthy Of it.

1941

1947
02:11:52,622 --> 02:11:55,056
Baba, dOn't say that.

1948
02:11:56,022 --> 02:11:57,091
Rupa is my sister.

1949
02:11:57,182 --> 02:11:59,173

YOu had tO take all this trOuble.

1962
02:14:52,742 --> 02:14:53,811
I was helpless.

1963
02:14:54,702 --> 02:14:58,456
If I hadn't fOllOwed him, he
wOuld have fled with the bag.

1964
02:14:59,462 --> 02:15:01,339
I wOuldn't have
been able tO face you.

1965
02:15:02,862 --> 02:15:03,931

Can I talk tO baba fOr a minute?

1972

And nOw.. I dOn't have the
strength tO hide it, baba.

1978
02:15:49,502 --> 02:15:50,571
But what is the matter?

1979
02:15:51,742 --> 02:15:54,814
Baba, I am very unfOrtunate man.

02:15:55,982 --> 02:15:57,973
In my childhOOd
because Of my mischief..

1981
02:15:58,062 --> 02:15:59,415
PeOple wOuld call me a lOafer.

1982
02:16:00,502 --> 02:16:06,338
But One day such a
mischief led me astray.

1983
02:16:07,742 --> 02:16:10,051
