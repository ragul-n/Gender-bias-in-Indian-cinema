1
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,350
Debar for 100 years?

2
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,320
Mahi! Are you still sleeping?

3
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,610
Whoa! You have already taken a shower.

4
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,190
Hmm. Very good.

5
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,190
Study for some time.

6
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,820
I...

7
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,360
Hate Maths!

8
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,900
I had a dream last night.

9
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,270
I flunked my exams and repeated 
10th grade all over again.

10
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,560
All the students were mocking me.

11
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,380
Stop laughing...

12
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,340
You were right beside me in my dream.

13
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,030
I also had a dream last night.

14
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,200
Teacher caught me cheating on my Math exam.

15
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,990
And I was debarred for 100 years.

16
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,070
Oh my god!

17
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,200
- I wasn’t in the dream with you, was I? 
- I’m not sure.

18
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,440
I won’t be there…

19
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,110
I’m not as dumb as you 
when it comes to Math.

20
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,320
Correct.

21
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,070
You’ll clear the exams anyway.

22
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,860
I just hope I pass the supplementary.

23
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,320
I’ll not take up Math ever again.

24
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,570
I’ll pursue Bi.P.C in Intermediate.

25
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,150
You don’t have to write the supplementary.

26
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,440
I have an idea for you.

27
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,320
What’s that?

28
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Let’s do combined studies.

29
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,490
What do you say?

30
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,570
Hello?

31
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,400
I should get Varna a return gift.

32
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,780
Have you got any ideas for me?

33
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,350
Our Pre-Final exams are in 2 days...

34
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,770
And you’re thinking about the return gift.

35
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,530
Yes! Give me an idea, buddy.

36
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,330
I don’t have any ideas. Bye!

37
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,480
Oh no!

38
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,050
Oh God!

39
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,430
Hello.

40
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,290
Yeah, he’s studying.

41
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,350
Mahi! You have a call from Vayunandan.

42
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,140
What is it? Tell me..

43
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,070
I have an idea for the return gift.

44
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,960
It’s too late, I got my own idea.

45
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,650
Oh, really? Care to tell me?

46
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,950
I’ll tell you in the evening.

47
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,910
In case my mom calls,

48
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,580
tell her I’m at your place.

49
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,740
We are doing combined studies. Okay?

50
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,120
Where are you going, man?

51
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,400
Bro, there’s a micro artist in the area 
that carves names on rice grains.

52
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,900
Where is he?

53
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,450
Tell me your name. 
- Vani

54
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,260
And the kid’s name?

55
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,550
Harish.

56
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,760
Rafi...

57
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,090
Boss?

58
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,600
You can collect it in 30 minutes.

59
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,430
What’s your name?

60
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,150
What got you thinking?

61
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,440
Tell me your name.

62
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,480
Actually, I’m not here to get 
my name carved.

63
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,520
If you are here to gift micro art 
to your girlfriend...

64
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,520
Get out of here immediately.

65
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,530
I’m saying this as the father 
to a teenage girl...

66
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,190
I don’t encourage teenage crushes.

67
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,980
He’s still a kid.

68
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,650
And he has a girlfriend already.

69
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,890
What are you looking at?

70
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,350
Mind your own business.

71
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,600
I’m going home...

72
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,920
Don’t leave unless you dispatch 
all the orders...

73
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,270
- Okay? 
- Hmm. Okay, boss.

74
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,200
I must thank you, bro.

75
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,670
I opened the store on time because 
you made me hurry.

76
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,910
Saved me from his sermon.

77
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,620
I’ll be going to college in 2 months.

78
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,330
Do I still look like a kid to him?

79
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,990
That’s how he is, bro. He’s too orthodox.

80
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,350
Don't feel bad.

81
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,030
You must’ve been hurt that 
he yelled at you.

82
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,780
But I was really scared.

83
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,950
Why is that?

84
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,200
He said he feels responsible 
as a teenage girl’s father...

85
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,990
His teenage daughter and I are in love.

86
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,670
He was too furious at you.

87
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,530
Wonder what he will do 
if he finds out about us.

88
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,410
He possibly can’t scare you, bro.

89
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,330
He might be elder to you.

90
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,950
But he’s got no talent.

91
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,530
He notes customer names 
and hands it to you.

92
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,120
You are the real deal.

93
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,660
You can get it done if you want to.

94
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,080
Will you please do it for me?

95
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,870
No way! My boss will find out.

96
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,030
I’ll not tell him... 
You won’t either.

97
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,530
There’s no way he’ll know.

98
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,910
- Where are you from? 
- Secunderabad.

99
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,550
You cycled this far from Secunderabad?

100
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,900
Hmm.

101
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,530
I like your sincerity.

102
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,230
I’ll do it for you.

103
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,150
But I should get to know you first...

104
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,120
Will you tell me your story?

105
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,530
Okay.

106
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,160
People born in the star ‘Revathi’ 
don’t have family support...

107
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,060
I’m a living example...

108
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,860
My family is not supportive to me...

109
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,330
Dad is on my side

110
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,700
but he’s always camping for work.

111
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:42,630
Me, my favorite hero Mahesh Babu, 
mom and grandma live together.

112
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,860
Chinna!

113
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,120
Hey, Chinna!

114
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,090
Where are you?

115
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,620
I’m almost done with this book.

116
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,100
Get me a new book from the temple.

117
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,370
Give me hundred bucks.

118
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,660
I just put it in the donation box.

119
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,310
So what? Take it out for me.

120
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,000
How can I do that?

121
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,390
Give me the money. 
I’ll show you how to do it.

122
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,050
Uh-huh.

123
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,390
Hey, Mahi!

124
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,240
My mom is calling...

125
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,540
I’ll be right back.

126
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,010
Will you wait tell then?

127
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,420
Or will you go to your husband?

128
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,970
What do you need?

129
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,430
I need you to go to the shop.

130
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,810
Did you keep me in home for the chores?

131
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,170
Why don’t you send me to boarding school 
along with sister?

132
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,420
Why are you hasty?

133
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,210
Finish your tenth grade... You’ll be 
sent to boarding school of course.

134
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,820
Mummy!

135
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,730
Grandma wants a new book.

136
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,860
Give me dad’s bike keys.

137
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,550
What do you mean?

138
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,350
You want to ride the bullet now?

139
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,460
Why can’t I do it?

140
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,100
I don’t know if you noticed...

141
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,490
But you’re not old enough yet. Now go!

142
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,810
When I look back at my teenage 
in a few years...

143
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,890
Grocery shop and the temple is all 
I have to remember.

144
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,360
Damn it! Bad mommy.

145
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,710
Hi, sister...

146
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,870
Are you studying well?

147
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,070
Yeah... So-so...

148
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,720
Why do you keep arguing with your family?

149
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,590
There are so many reasons.

150
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,010
First of all... 
They make me do all the chores.

151
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,210
Second of all...

152
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,070
They still treat me like a kid.

153
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,920
I have to bring milk everyday...

154
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,530
They make tea for themselves. 
And milk is all I get.

155
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,460
Am I still looking like a milkboy?

156
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,300
I guess this smile made him fall for you.

157
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,500
Who?

158
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,840
A guy in this colony is a big fan 
of your smile.

159
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,410
Really? Who is it?

160
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,590
Do I still look like a milkboy?

161
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,950
No. No. Not at all.

162
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,660
Now you're a grown up boy.

163
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,570
His name is Srikanth.

164
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,090
He moved to D block 6 months back.

165
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,130
He wants me to give you his love letters.

166
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,820
Why didn’t you help him?

167
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,860
First reason.

168
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,390
I don’t like people who ask me favors.

169
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,240
Second reason...

170
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,370
I’m not a kid to pass love letters.

171
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,490
Please, please... For once...

172
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,150
Put aside your reasons and 
take the letters next time.

173
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,700
Let’s see what he wrote.

174
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,560
No! No! Never! I will not doing that.

175
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,260
Bye!

176
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,190
Come on! Give me the money!

177
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,850
Give me the money.

178
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,800
We’re the recent victims to this monster 
from the other colony...

179
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,030
He grabs our underwear and steals 
our pocket money.

180
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,200
Bad luck!

181
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,160
My friend Vayunandan is his prey for today.

182
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,120
Move! Move! Keep going.

183
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,250
You can’t escape from me.

184
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,210
- Come on! Pedal faster. 
- He’s coming. Keep going.

185
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,460
Go fast, bro!

186
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,510
Go! Go!

187
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,220
He’s coming. He’s so close. 
Go fast!

188
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,010
Keep going, bro. He’s going to get us.

189
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,220
Keep going. Keep going.

190
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,470
Leave me.

191
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,640
You think you’re a hero, huh?

192
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,120
Give me all you’ve got.

193
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,200
No. Stop.

194
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,170
Hey!

195
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:11,860
No!

196
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,570
Pay up!

197
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,860
No, that’s my money!

198
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,780
See...

199
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,110
I lost the 100 bucks mom gave me.

200
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,570
Hello!

201
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,100
I’ll give you this.

202
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,540
Give his money back.

203
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,540
Alright. Take it.

204
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,720
Hey!

205
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,810
What do we do now?

206
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,930
Mom will kill me if I go home 
without the sugar.

207
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,310
You go to that shop everyday.

208
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,510
Ask him for credit.

209
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,430
He might give the sugar on credit...

210
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,030
But he’ll not give the change 
for 100 bucks.

211
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,850
Money is more important to mom than sugar.

212
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,050
Hey, dude!

213
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,680
I got the money.

214
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:26,800
Yes!

215
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,050
Hey! Hey!

216
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,680
Hey! Hey! Don’t cry.

217
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,260
I’ll buy you a new one.

218
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,300
We’ll only buy it. Just give us the money.

219
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,390
You just want the money?

220
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,180
Hey! Hey! Stop.

221
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,490
Alright. How much?

222
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,100
- 100 rupees. 
- Hey! It’s for 150 bucks, bro.

223
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,100
Yeah, right. 150 bucks. 150 bucks.

224
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,760
- 150? 
- Yeah, 150.

225
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,680
Okay. I’ll give you the money.

226
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,180
Not just 150. I’ll give you 200 bucks.

227
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,350
Please don’t cry, okay?

228
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,350
I only have 50 bucks right now.

229
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,640
Take it. My store is close by.

230
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,470
Take the remaining amount 
over there. Okay?

231
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,600
Shit!

232
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,350
I’ve got no cash here.

233
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,810
What the hell! No one’s coming.

234
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,230
Do you have customers around this time?

235
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,380
Yeah. Wait.

236
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,520
Hey, boy. Move.

237
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,080
Hey, sweetie. Give me money.

238
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,170
Those kids are waiting for the money...

239
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,450
Go away.

240
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,170
He doesn't even have 10 rupees with him.

241
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,750
Boy, give me some money.

242
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,110
They’re kids. They won’t have cash on them.

243
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,310
- Let’s go. 
- Huh? We’re kids?!

244
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,650
Hey! No! No!

245
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Come on, give it.

246
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,150
Here you go.

247
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,980
- See that? 
- Wow!

248
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,520
God bless you.

249
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,480
God bless you.

250
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,750
Why are you so angry, bro?

251
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,370
I don’t know where his money 
is coming from.

252
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,460
But he buys a new shirt everyday.

253
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,120
At first, I was happy to get 
a good customer.

254
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,560
But I found out he dresses up everyday...

255
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,610
Only to impress the girl I like, Shalini.

256
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,480
- Oh. 
- Here’s 150 bucks.

257
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,520
He bought shirts in this model, right?

258
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,110
Yeah, right.

259
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,810
Give me these 3 shirts.

260
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,650
I’ll try to drive him out of the colony.

261
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,230
I'll give you my store if you can do that.

262
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
What’s the plan?

263
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,530
Bananas!

264
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,500
Bananas!

265
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,080
Bananas!

266
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,090
What? That’s a two-sided shirt?!

267
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,650
Hey...

268
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,960
You keep watching...

269
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,750
- I’ll be right back, okay? 
- Okay.

270
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,140
Grandpa... Grandpa...

271
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,420
Take it.

272
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,770
Look ahead.

273
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,850
Mind your own business.

274
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,680
Pramila, here I am.

275
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:09,760
Hi!

276
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,880
All other schools declared 
holidays already.

277
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,830
Is your school still working?

278
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,640
No holidays for 10th graders 
in our school.

279
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,200
Show me your hand.

280
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,520
What is this?

281
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:15,390
Today, I put a waste paper in 
my school corridor in the dustbin.

282
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,850
That was it. My class teacher noticed...

283
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,720
She informed the Head Mistress...

284
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,390
She called me on stage

285
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,140
and said ‘You are caught while 
doing something good’.

286
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,510
She had the students applaud me 
and tie this band.

287
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,950
Now you were caught while doing 
something good...

288
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,450
So you deserve it.

289
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,130
I think mom is home.

290
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,560
I should get ready for tuition. Bu-bye.

291
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,450
Hey, girl. Care to offer us some?

292
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,070
Go ask them.

293
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,940
Hey, sweetie!

294
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,870
Sweetie!

295
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,780
Sweetie, give us some.

296
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,530
That girl sent us to you.

297
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,660
She said you have the holy offering.

298
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,030
Come on, give it.

299
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,200
Wow! Same pinch!

300
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,070
Pinch me.

301
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,160
Huh? Pinch you?!

302
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,320
Don’t you know what pinching means?

303
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,370
Come on, sweetie. Pinch me.

304
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,700
Pinch me, sweetie.

305
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,200
Go away. Go away.

306
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,080
Yay!!!

307
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,330
Sweetie, stop.

308
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,670
Hey, boy.

309
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,640
How long to fix the puncture?

310
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,920
About 10 minutes.

311
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,030
Hey...

312
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,320
Give me that.

313
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,020
Get the bike fixed...

314
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,900
I’ll go return these to Karthik bro.

315
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,080
Ball, please. Ball. Ball. Ball.

316
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,080
Hey, stop!

317
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,790
What are you looking at?

318
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,370
Hey!

319
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,670
A girl passed by, staring at you.

320
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,730
This is not the first time.

321
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,080
When you went to return 
Karthik bro’s shirts...

322
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,000
Yes...

323
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,670
She was staring at you back then too.

324
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,540
Hey! There she is.

325
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,940
Pedal faster. Go!

326
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,100
National College.

327
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,120
She’s a college student?!

328
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,540
Are you okay with that?

329
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,770
What’s happening in your college, bro?

330
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,240
Who are all those people?

331
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,710
They are the future college students...

332
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,620
Pre admissions are going on 
for 10th graders.

333
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,980
Admissions so early?

334
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,790
We aren’t done with exams yet.

335
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,200
Seats will be occupied 
if you wait till then.

336
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,790
You have to reserve in advance.

337
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,870
Hey!

338
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,990
Hey!

339
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,540
Damn!

340
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,780
Hey...

341
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,850
What is it?

342
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,580
Come here.

343
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,130
Who are you guys?

344
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,690
Bro, we are tenth grade students...

345
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,150
We’re here for the pre admissions.

346
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,460
Yes.

347
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:38,360
Go to my room 104 and clean up. 
Also leave the key in the window.

348
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,690
Okay?

349
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,110
Yeah, sure.

350
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,030
Go.

351
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,830
Hey...

352
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,230
Don’t touch any of my stuff in the room.

353
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,400
Okay, bro.

354
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,070
Don’t touch any of my stuff in the room.

355
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,240
Yuck! Yuck!

356
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,280
This is not a soft drink.

357
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,570
Hey, Mahi...

358
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,020
That girl is over here. Look.

359
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,770
Hey!

360
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:14,750
Hey!

361
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,170
She’s leaving...

362
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,000
I’m following her. 
You come home somehow. Bye.

363
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,590
- Hello, ma’am. 
- Hello.

364
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,500
- Did you get the admission? 
- Yeah, we did.

365
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,590
Thank you, ma’am.

366
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,010
Hey!

367
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,930
Who are you?

368
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,760
Baby, hold this. Come on.

369
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,860
Srikanth bro!

370
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,830
This is my first ever love letter.

371
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,040
I’m writing the words I can’t express.

372
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,460
Song from the film ‘ Swapna’, 
sung by SP Bala Subrahmanyam.

373
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,020
Requested from Bellampalli by...

374
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:40,680
Yesudas Goud, Srinivas Goud,Yadagiri Goud, 
Mallesh Goud and Prakash Goud.

375
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,130
"I feel youthful all of a sudden"

376
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,920
"I run to you with excitement"

377
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,670
"I can't take my eyes off you"

378
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,720
"My heart is jumping out of joy"

379
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:12,130
"Shall I welcome your 
glances striking at me?"

380
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:20,170
"Shall I thank your 
heart for choosing me?"

381
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:50,210
"Your tempting beauty..."

382
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,330
"I see it all around me"

383
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,220
"Your amusing thoughts..."

384
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,570
"I feel them take over me"

385
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,130
"The day I don't get to see you"

386
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,180
"My life feels withered"

387
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,180
"The second I don't 
get to think of you"

388
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:18,560
"I feel a void in me"

389
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,690
"I feel youthful all of a sudden"

390
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,240
Sister...

391
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,670
What?

392
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,100
You asked for it, right? Here you go.

393
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,650
I got you his love letter.

394
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,650
Oh, thank you.

395
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,650
Can I give a small piece of advice?

396
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,000
What?

397
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
Don’t love him.

398
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,890
His love is not original.

399
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,100
Hi!

400
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,660
Mahi Teja?

401
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,200
I know your name. Do you know mine?

402
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,910
That day at the market...

403
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,860
You left without writing your name 
on the board.

404
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,980
Varna.

405
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,440
Oh. Varna.

406
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,290
Deepika.

407
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:51,840
Hi.

408
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,720
- Hi. 
- I’m Deepika.

409
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,370
Mahi Teja.

410
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,100
Which grade are you in?

411
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,070
10th grade.

412
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,950
Wow! We’re also in the 10th grade.

413
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,090
Which school?

414
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,460
Vivekananda High School.

415
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,380
Mm-hmm.

416
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,670
We’re from Veda High School.

417
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:05,960
Oh, okay.

418
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,980
Varna told us a lot about you.

419
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,360
About me?

420
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,630
You gave a shirt to an old man 
on the street.

421
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,240
Remember?

422
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,340
Yeah. I’ve noticed a couple of times 
since then...

423
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,260
I wanted to be friends with you.

424
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,390
Hold this.

425
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,840
Show me your hand.

426
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,840
Why?

427
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,210
Show me your hand!

428
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,720
What is this?

429
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,630
It’s a special band for 
‘Caught while doing something great’.

430
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,540
We visited Balaji temple recently.

431
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,250
We came across a shop 
called ‘Eega Micro Arts’.

432
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,670
We had this specially made for you.

433
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,000
We had your name carved on a rice grain...

434
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,590
And got a magnifying glass fixed 
around it.

435
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,630
Do you like it?

436
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,670
You had my name carved on a rice grain?

437
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,920
That is why I asked your name 
at the market.

438
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,890
I didn’t know a girl’s look have 
so much to say.

439
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,920
Hey, Mahi!

440
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,900
Hi!

441
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,030
Okay then. Bye.

442
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:24,990
Hmm. Bye.

443
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,240
Okay. Bye.

444
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,860
Buddy, introduce them to me.

445
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,040
Varna...

446
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
Come, let’s go.

447
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,300
This is my friend.

448
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,500
Hi. Vayu. Vayunandan.

449
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,920
I’m Deepu. Deepika.

450
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,790
Hey! Are you in love?

451
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,910
Umm...

452
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,310
Naughty boy! Come on. Come on.

453
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,570
But it’s pointless...

454
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,700
She thinks I’m just a friend.

455
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,920
It’s really hard for me to just be 
friends with her.

456
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,210
Hey, don’t worry.

457
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,290
Girls say you’re just a friend at first...

458
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,670
They will only propose later.

459
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,080
What if she doesn't propose?

460
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,550
We will do it.

461
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,290
But this is not the time.

462
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,300
High school girls are very dangerous.

463
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,920
They share everything with their moms.

464
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,210
But if we wait until college...

465
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:06,000
Because they start feeling like adults...

466
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,330
They don’t tell their moms...

467
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,790
They will accept us easily.

468
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,430
Mummy...

469
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,930
Want me to help?

470
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,680
Don’t assume I’m looking for a favour.

471
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,640
I need to discuss something important 
in my life.

472
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:41,930
Hmm.

473
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,580
Tell me.

474
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,220
Have you thought about 
my college admission?

475
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,220
There’s a lot of time.

476
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,770
Finish your exams first.

477
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,720
If we wait till then...

478
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,720
All the good college seats will be full.

479
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:59,020
You’ll get me into some 
crappy college then.

480
00:40:59,310 --> 00:40:59,970
Hmm.

481
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:04,060
Looks like you’ve already chosen a college.

482
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,400
You are smart, mom.

483
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,290
Which college is it?

484
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,310
National College.

485
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,560
Do they have hostel facility?

486
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,690
Why Hostel?

487
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,490
You wanted to be a hosteller 
in Intermediate, right?

488
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,240
That college has a super cool hostel.

489
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,200
Oh.

490
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,700
So you have everything sorted.

491
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,860
Hmm.

492
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,530
Okay. I’ll talk to your dad tomorrow 
and let you know.

493
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,040
Why wait, mom?

494
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,700
Talk to him right now.

495
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,160
He must be busy right now...

496
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,750
He’ll get angry if we disturb him.

497
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,160
Why are you in a hurry? 
I’ll talk to him.

498
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,360
Okay?

499
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
- You go. 
- Okay.

500
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,450
Hey!

501
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,370
You’re going to school.

502
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,370
Not a movie show.

503
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,160
Button up your shirt.

504
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,370
Hey!

505
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,040
Why don’t you listen to your mom?

506
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,910
Button up completely.

507
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,580
Also, close the gate on your way.

508
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,250
Why don’t you do it?

509
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,430
Here. Take it.

510
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:55,480
Finish it before the assembly ends.

511
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,260
I’m tired of eating cashew every day.

512
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,590
Bring almonds from tomorrow.

513
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,870
Why did you miss the prayer?

514
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,030
Silence!

515
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,240
Take the chewing gum.

516
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,040
In our story, Patan was against 
King Ramaraju’s activities.

517
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:37,080
He chewed hard on the bread 
to express disinterest.

518
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,780
He spit it out to show disgust, rage,

519
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,720
agony, anger, grudge and grief.

520
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:43,740
Silence!

521
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,930
Silence!

522
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,130
And every time I saw him 
in the play again...

523
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,120
I was ecstatic with joy 
like everyone else.

524
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:56,200
Raghava’s performance was highly 
applauded by the spectators.

525
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,590
K. Vayunandan...

526
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,030
Come here.

527
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:26,570
Write this sum on the board.

528
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,200
What is the answer?

529
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,740
Y is equal to 23 by 10.

530
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,590
Why was the solution different 
in your book?

531
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:53,420
Why?

532
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,320
Show me your hand! Why?

533
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,060
Why?

534
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,070
Tell me how.

535
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,330
How?

536
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,350
Go.

537
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,670
Useless fellows!

538
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,630
Come here.

539
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,240
Where is your homework?

540
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,960
Show me your hand!

541
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:41,790
[LAUGHS]

542
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:43,650
Who’s laughing, eh?

543
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,790
Who is that?

544
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:46,730
Come here!

545
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,870
Go sit.

546
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,840
Write the formula from yesterday 
on the board.

547
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,880
Hmm. Come on.

548
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,400
Make it fast!

549
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,670
Come here.

550
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,580
You forgot the formula already.

551
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,130
Why are you laughing?

552
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,620
What’s so funny, huh?

553
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:26,870
What is it?

554
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,240
Show me your hand!

555
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,030
- Sir... Sir... 
- Why were you laughing so hard?

556
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,490
- It’s my fault, sir. Sorry. 
- Why were you laughing?

557
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:33,660
Sorry, sir.

558
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,880
Your brains are like the Bermuda Triangle.

559
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,540
Information goes in and never comes out.

560
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,190
Listen!

561
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:45,450
Write this formula a 1000 times 
as imposition.

562
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:46,870
- Hmm. 
- Go!

563
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,740
Oh god! No!

564
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:00,330
Hey! What if Bussu sir saw you?

565
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,180
He’ll smack me for being with you.

566
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,380
He who terrifies everyone at school... 
His name’s Nagendra Kumar.

567
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,780
And when he takes a day off...

568
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:13,410
We celebrate that day like a festival.

569
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:18,530
One of my seniors resorted to 
black magic to see him dead.

570
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,780
He doesn’t let any of his students 
attend tuitions.

571
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,990
He takes it as an insult if they do.

572
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,830
A Corporate College offered him 
a job last year.

573
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:31,120
We prayed our hearts out that 
he accepts it.

574
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:34,330
But Gods are not so merciful with us.

575
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,240
Okay. What happened next?

576
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,510
Grandma...

577
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,490
Grandma...

578
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,940
What is this?

579
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,650
It is also a God’s name.

580
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,290
Just write it a1000 times.

581
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,220
You’ll be blessed.

582
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:58,000
Mommy! Mommy!

583
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,090
Did you speak to dad?

584
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,000
Hmm.

585
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:01,900
I did.

586
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,100
He said we couldn’t afford that college.

587
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:06,590
Why?

588
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,640
Fee structure is very high in that college.

589
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,710
He wants you to find a college 
that is in our range.

590
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,170
Please, mom.

591
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:16,320
I don’t want to go to a different college. 
I want to join in that college only.

592
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,290
Please!

593
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,510
It’s not just about the fee.

594
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,500
You’re poor in Math too.

595
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:24,730
But I’m focusing totally 
on Maths right now.

596
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,330
I’ve improved a lot, mom.

597
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:28,830
When do you have your Pre Finals?

598
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,500
12th February.

599
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,910
Score 95 marks in Math.

600
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:34,660
Huh?!

601
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,450
I’ll get you admitted in National College.

602
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,540
Deal?

603
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,040
My mom wasn’t ready to be convinced.

604
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,620
I called my dad and spoke to him.

605
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,250
He said mom’s word was final.

606
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,040
Everyone takes final exams seriously.

607
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:58,660
But she compelled me to focus 
on the Pre Finals.

608
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,040
Are you done?

609
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:14,750
You ruined it.

610
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,160
1000 times.

611
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:25,830
Can’t do it.

612
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,680
Consider matrix A and B

613
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:54,000
A equal to 1425

614
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,620
B equal to

615
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,510
9 minus 4 minus 2

616
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:00,700
Huh. Tell me.

617
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,970
Then find A cross B

618
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:06,130
and B cross A

619
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,360
First, A cross B

620
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,030
A cross B equal to

621
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:14,460
Matrix A into Matrix B

622
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,580
‘Score 95 marks in Math.’

623
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,830
‘I’ll get you admitted in National College.’

624
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,450
Mr. Vaman Rao...

625
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,410
You’re clever in Math and I’m poor.

626
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,410
Why?

627
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,660
Did you have a literacy initiation 
ceremony in Basara?

628
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:39,910
No.

629
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:44,040
Do you eat raw ladies finger?

630
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:45,250
No.

631
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,540
Is your mom or dad a Math teacher?

632
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:49,830
Uh-huh.

633
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:54,180
Do you carry a 6 box lunch 
pack to school?

634
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,290
No.

635
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,590
Do you have a peacock feather 
in your Math text?

636
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:01,970
No.

637
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,630
You’re poor in Math because 
you do none of this.

638
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:17,800
Renowned Psychologist Srikanth Acharya...

639
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:23,100
Now you’re going into a sleepy, dopey, 
wonderful state of relaxation.

640
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,540
You’re in a peaceful state of mind.

641
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,750
Imagine a tunnel in your heart.

642
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:33,080
Just imagine a tunnel.

643
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,580
Can you see a book there?

644
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,750
One Math book.

645
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,540
That’s the Math text you highly fear.

646
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,830
Slowly try to hold the book.

647
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,250
No!

648
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,330
No!

649
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:02,620
No!

650
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:06,460
Nagendra sir! Math teacher!

651
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,080
[STAMMERS] He beats me. No.

652
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:14,640
Relax. Now relax.

653
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:18,960
Slowly open your eyes.

654
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,230
Your teacher is the reason you fear Math.

655
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:28,490
Your transferred the negativity 
towards him to your subject.

656
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,850
First try to perceive him positively.

657
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:35,530
You’ll automatically develop 
an interest in Math.

658
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:36,880
All the best.

659
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,110
- Happy birthday to you, sir! 
- Thanks, David.

660
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,460
Happy birthday, sir.

661
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:02,560
Happy birthday, sir.

662
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:12,240
Huh?! Pre Finals question paper.

663
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:33,030
[MUGGING MATH]

664
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:45,750
Ugh! Damn it.

665
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,640
[CONTINUES MUGGING MATH]

666
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,110
It’s a subject I don’t understand at all.

667
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,270
I couldn’t mug it up.

668
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:19,260
If a micro artist like you is convinced...

669
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,350
I’ll pass the Math exam easily.

670
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:25,230
If you make slips on nails, pencils, 
pads and erasers...

671
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,150
I can cover the entire syllabus.

672
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:37,980
So you didn't come here 
for your girlfriend's gift?

673
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:49,590
How will you see the micro letters 
with your eyes?

674
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,270
A protractor with a fixed 
magnifying glass.

675
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,020
Who the hell called you a kid, bro?

676
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,560
Bro... Bro, please...

677
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:19,540
Bro... Bro...

678
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,430
Bro, please do it. Please!

679
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,470
I’m asking you. Please leave me.

680
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,960
I just want you to help with Math.

681
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:28,340
I’m good at all other subjects. Please!

682
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,960
You think I’ve got no cash on me?

683
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,100
Look how much I’ve got.

684
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:42,460
Wait!

685
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:45,210
I’ll tell your boss about your love story.

686
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:50,920
Please do that for me...

687
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,710
We don't have the courage to do it.

688
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,200
Will you do me a favor?

689
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,090
What is it?

690
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:03,620
Don’t tell anyone what I told you.

691
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:07,490
After listening to your story 
I feel like helping you...

692
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,760
But I can’t make micro slips for you.

693
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,010
I used to work in a photography shop.

694
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:17,390
My boss got me here 
to train me in micro art.

695
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,600
I’m just a trainee.

696
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,620
Only my boss can help you out...

697
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,430
He has the skill to carve on anything.

698
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:28,610
He can carve up to 24 letters 
on a rice grain.

699
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:29,790
Oh no!

700
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,950
Your boss will call the cops 
if he finds out.

701
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,020
Uh-huh.

702
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:53,880
What are these, bro?

703
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,880
I’ll tell you. Wait.

704
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,500
Why did you leave the shop?

705
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,840
A Math Professor visited after you left...

706
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,400
He wrote a new book...

707
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:22,620
He heard you’re a great micro artist 
and came to us.

708
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,940
I got this photo frame ready.

709
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,360
He wants everything in that book carved 
on this frame.

710
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:36,350
He said the book is highly useful 
to all the students in our country.

711
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,420
In the 30 years of my service...

712
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:50,090
I got chance to do something good 
for the first time...

713
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:51,440
Well done, Rafi!

714
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,080
My boss agreed.

715
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,070
Where did you go?

716
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:20,520
Your mom called me several times for you.

717
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,340
Did you tell her what I told you?

718
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,900
I did... But I feared she’d get 
suspicious and come home.

719
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,770
I’m here now... Don’t feel tension.

720
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:30,990
Hmm.

721
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,650
So, what gift did you get for Varna?

722
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,260
Suspense.

723
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,350
You stay here. I’ll be right back.

724
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:16,560
Okay.

725
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:20,640
Take it.

726
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:24,600
Check it out.

727
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:32,550
You are cheating now because 
you know the questions...

728
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,400
How will you manage final exams?

729
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:38,440
This is the paper Bussu sir prepared.

730
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:43,570
This is all I need to clear the Finals.

731
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:47,240
So will you cheat in your Finals too?

732
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,330
Yes!

733
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,170
Bro!

734
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,370
Bro!

735
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:56,500
No. No. No. Return it.

736
01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:59,070
- No. It will be a problem. 
- No. Go return it.

737
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:02,990
Ugh! I’ll be in trouble 
if he’s caught during Finals.

738
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,630
Why don’t you get it? 
- It’s going to be fine. Give it to him.

739
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,060
I shouldn’t have told you 
about that idiot.

740
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:13,230
I thought he is cheating 
only in pre-finals...

741
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:16,780
I would've refused if I knew 
you’d cheat in your Finals.

742
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:18,640
Take it!

743
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,840
I'll pray to God that you don’t get caught.

744
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:26,320
In case you’re caught... 
Please don’t take my name.

745
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,230
I won’t. I promise.

746
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,110
Thank you, sister.

747
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,340
Mahi!

748
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,890
Your Math exam is today, right?

749
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:49,040
Yeah.

750
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:50,360
Did you prepare well?

751
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:53,580
Yeah.

752
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,650
Do well in your exam.

753
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:01,610
Hmm.

754
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,380
Pre-Finals are just a practice test 
for Final exams...

755
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:27,040
In case you plan on cheating...

756
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,920
You better show yourself.

757
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,980
If I catch you instead...

758
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:35,260
The punishment is going to be harsh.

759
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,210
Now you can start.

760
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,210
Get up.

761
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:24,510
Come on, get up!

762
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,040
Step out.

763
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:57,780
Now come on.

764
01:05:58,590 --> 01:05:59,670
Time is up.

765
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:01,180
Get me the papers.

766
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,320
Why are you so tensed?

767
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:14,510
Our Pre Finals results are out.

768
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,590
I saw it on the notice board.

769
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:17,910
Really?

770
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:20,010
- Let’s go check. 
- No.

771
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:21,720
I want to skip this. You go.

772
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:23,170
Why?

773
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,900
You just go and see my marks.

774
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:28,180
If I score less than 95 in Math, 
don't tell me.

775
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,510
Hmm. Okay.

776
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,250
All the best!

777
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:35,010
Move aside, guys. Let me check.

778
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:36,180
Hey, move!

779
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:39,310
Hold on.

780
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:41,180
Huh?!

781
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,550
First language, Second language, 
English and Math...

782
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:48,220
Buddy, you didn’t score 95 in Math.

783
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:49,840
Damn it!

784
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,010
You scored a 100!

785
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:53,140
- Huh?! 
- Hmm.

786
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,890
You topped our class in Pre-Finals.

787
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:56,100
Yay!!!

788
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:14,060
Hey!

789
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:34,180
"The day you grow a moustache 
The day you get beaten up"

790
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,610
"The day you feel youthful 
It's the last day of high school"

791
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:51,190
"Let's blow off the 
pressure from 5 years"

792
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:58,370
"Let's be rid of the 
hard times back here"

793
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:12,440
"Let's bid adieu to the 
times spent in fear"

794
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:19,650
"Let's groove away hoping 
for a better tomorrow"

795
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:54,980
"I wish to join you in 
11th and 12th grade"

796
01:08:55,820 --> 01:09:02,320
"I wish to read out my poems for you"

797
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:22,650
"The day we shift classes 
The day we build muscle"

798
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:26,140
"The day we feel too full of ourselves 
It's the last day of high school"

799
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,930
Even the poor students score 
70 percent these days.

800
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,210
I expected you to do really well...

801
01:09:57,620 --> 01:10:00,250
And paid the Pre-Admission fee in college.

802
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,820
These are just Pre-Finals, mom.

803
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:05,040
Not the Finals.

804
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,430
Are you going to do wonders in the Finals?

805
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,070
You’ll score around the same percentage.

806
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:17,550
Where are you going?

807
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:21,200
To take refund from the college.

808
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,660
Bye.

809
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:46,710
Bye.

810
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,460
My....

811
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,620
Bracelet.

812
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:11,510
Hey, boy! Nagendra sir is calling you.

813
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:46,390
I checked your past academic record.

814
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:50,320
All these years you were just 
an average student.

815
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:53,900
Passed just on the edge.

816
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:58,950
How did you score 100 percent 
in the Pre-Finals?

817
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:00,700
Hmm?

818
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:02,180
Did you cheat?

819
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:05,870
Tell me! Did you cheat?

820
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,410
Tell me!

821
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,430
Yes!

822
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,700
I cheated in Pre-Finals.

823
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:38,280
The reason I cheated is you.

824
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:41,970
The reason I hate Math is you.

825
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,220
Every time I’d open the Math book...

826
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:47,570
I’d think of your boring face.

827
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:50,310
Five years!

828
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,070
Five years of my valuable high school life.

829
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:54,870
It’s in vain because of you.

830
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:59,950
Why do you dress like a scientist?

831
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:05,180
Don’t you have any other clothes?

832
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,980
Everyday in your life is the same...

833
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:11,250
Even if you live for a thousand years... 
It doesn’t matter.

834
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:14,130
Thank god!

835
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:18,820
I vented all my anger from 5 years.

836
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:22,150
Now I’m feeling so relieved.

837
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:28,070
You just guessed that I cheated.

838
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:34,560
But you’d take a gazillion years 
to prove how.

839
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,240
Bye.

840
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,340
Stop.

841
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,150
I called the mobile number 
on the back of your bracelet.

842
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:58,470
Micro artist Eega Damodar...

843
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:02,990
He told me everything about 
your photo frame.

844
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:09,420
I wondered how you know 
the question paper I prepared.

845
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:14,730
I was clear when my file was 
displaced in the car.

846
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:20,280
Hall tickets are issued.

847
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:25,730
You’ll give your exams and 
go straight to college.

848
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,700
You must have thought 
I can’t harm you, right?

849
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:33,200
Your examination center Principal 
Sunil Sharma...

850
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,610
Is my classmate.

851
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:39,090
I’ll make sure you don’t give 
your Final exams.

852
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,940
Hey! Clean properly.

853
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:50,360
Our seniors had fun and we have to clean?

854
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:54,060
When we have fun next year, 
our juniors have do it for us.

855
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:55,760
Eat.

856
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:01,060
Hi!

857
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:06,390
Is this your bracelet?

858
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:08,630
I only gave it to Nagendra sir.

859
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,630
All the girls in our class are waiting 
to grab your books.

860
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,430
But you should give it to me.

861
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,540
That’s because I did you a favor.

862
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:18,680
Come... Come...

863
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:19,900
Hey. Mounika!

864
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,290
Yeah, ma’am. Coming.

865
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,920
What are you doing there? Come fast.

866
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,020
Okay, bye.

867
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:26,590
Hey!

868
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:28,720
Please don’t forget.

869
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:31,340
My ambition is to join National College.

870
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,550
Mommy!

871
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:38,130
Mommy!

872
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,790
Did you pay the pre admission fee?

873
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:42,070
Would you leave me alone if I didn’t?

874
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:44,440
Here’s the receipt.

875
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:49,340
Do you know why I conditioned you 
to score 95 in Math?

876
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:50,610
Why?

877
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:53,330
Cut off marks were 95 last year 
in that college...

878
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,950
- Really? 
- Yeah.

879
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:59,320
Don’t be overconfident that 
you scored 100 in Pre Finals.

880
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:02,170
Study well and score good grades 
in Finals as well.

881
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,050
We’d have to lose our admission fee 
otherwise.

882
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,480
But why?

883
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:08,320
I asked them the same question...

884
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,900
And they said they have no refunds.

885
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:25,130
They don’t have a refund policy.

886
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,580
We lost 10K on your admission.

887
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,920
Pre Finals are just for practice, mom.

888
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:33,850
I’ll score good in the Finals.

889
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:36,630
Alright.

890
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:38,160
Go to your room and study.

891
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:41,490
Don’t you dare step out until 
the end of exams.

892
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,150
Mom...

893
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,280
Send her food to her room.

894
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:50,320
I’ll be bored to study alone, mom.

895
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:52,910
That is why I got less marks in Pre Finals.

896
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:55,530
I’ll study with my friends...

897
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,960
- Friends? 
- Deepika and Sri Vani.

898
01:16:58,170 --> 01:16:59,750
How much did they score?

899
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,880
Deepika scored 90 percent.

900
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,550
And Sri Vani scored 92 percent.

901
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:08,520
You said Pre Finals are just for practice.

902
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,840
How come they scored so much?

903
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,920
They do combined studies, mom.

904
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:14,280
Unlike me.

905
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:16,080
Alright...

906
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:17,710
Ask them to come home and study.

907
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:18,550
Uh-huh.

908
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,960
They go to the Central Library to study.

909
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:23,590
I heard whoever studied there are 
top rankers.

910
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:47,560
Why are you still scared of him?

911
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,560
Buddy...

912
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:53,380
I need to tell you something important. 
- What is it?

913
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,050
Every time I’d open the Math book...

914
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:57,420
I’d think of your boring face.

915
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,880
Don’t you have any other clothes?

916
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,590
What the hell have you done?

917
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:07,590
Even our Head Master is terrified of him.

918
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:11,210
How could you yell at him like that?

919
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:14,480
You know his name’s Nagendra.

920
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:16,590
Translates to King of Snakes.

921
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:18,510
He’ll definitely hold a grudge.

922
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,230
He’ll not let you go so easily.

923
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:22,090
I’m already tensed.

924
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:25,920
Don’t talk about snakes and grudges.

925
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:27,340
Oh, no!

926
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:29,590
If he saw me with you...

927
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,510
He’ll hold a grudge on me too 
and fail me.

928
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,840
I’ll leave. 
You continue. Bye.

929
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:37,010
He yelled at him?!

930
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:39,050
How could he do that?

931
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:43,090
Hey, I told my mom you two scored 
above 90 percent.

932
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,010
You tell her the same, okay?

933
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:45,920
Hmm?

934
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:48,990
Please.

935
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:57,820
Hi.

936
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:59,020
Hi.

937
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:00,840
Where’s Mahi?

938
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:01,810
Oh.

939
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:05,360
He’s jumping around from the 
joy of topping the class.

940
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:06,870
Mahi topped the class?!

941
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:08,330
What’s his percentage?

942
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:09,620
95 percent.

943
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:11,410
And he got a 100 in Math.

944
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:13,640
100 in Math?! Really?

945
01:19:13,730 --> 01:19:17,360
I could give you Math teacher 
Nagendra sir’s address.

946
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:19,070
Go find out yourself.

947
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:20,360
Hmm. Give it to me.

948
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:21,970
Stop it.

949
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:23,360
Where’s Mahi now?

950
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:26,740
Look. There he is.

951
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,820
I’ve got some urgent work. I got to go.

952
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:32,220
Bye!

953
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,110
Hi, Class Topper!

954
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,610
Congratulations!

955
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:43,270
How do you guys know?

956
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,730
Vayunandan told us.

957
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:48,110
We’re going to the Central Library 
for combined studies.

958
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:49,850
Why don’t you join us?

959
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:52,070
Why not? Obviously...

960
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:55,010
Thank god! My Math is sorted now.

961
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:58,390
You can clarify all our doubts.

962
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:02,360
- Doubts? 
- Okay then. Let’s go.

963
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:08,340
Come.

964
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,110
I can’t come right now.

965
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:13,720
I’ll join you in a couple of days.

966
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:16,500
Meanwhile, take Vayunandan with you.

967
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,540
He loves combined studies.

968
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:20,880
Uh-huh?

969
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:23,210
Hey, Vayu!

970
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,280
Come out.

971
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:27,390
Ugh! What is it, dad?

972
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:33,490
Hi!

973
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,960
Will you join them for combined studies?

974
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,000
Combined studies with you?

975
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:43,370
Yeah, sure!

976
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:46,090
Is Mahi coming?

977
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:47,090
Uh-huh.

978
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:49,160
Mahi is busy. He is not coming.

979
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:03,600
I can prove 7 is an even number.

980
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:06,940
What?! 7? 
How will you prove it’s even?

981
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:08,650
It's simple.

982
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,500
S-E-V-E-N.

983
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:11,540
Seven!

984
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:13,710
Remove the ‘S’ and it’s ‘Even’.

985
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:30,430
- Hey... 
- Hmm?

986
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:31,650
Can you solve this sum?

987
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:38,380
Vayu, can you solve this?

988
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:40,340
I don't know.

989
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:44,240
What about you?

990
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:52,030
Okay. Let’s go home and try.

991
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:55,740
Whoever finds the solution gets 
an ice cream treat.

992
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,010
Okay.

993
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:06,050
What are you doing here?

994
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,150
Is this the ice cream treat question?

995
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:10,600
How do you know?

996
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:34,820
If you want to work hard 
instead of cheating...

997
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,490
I’ll be your tutor.

998
01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:38,720
Decide and meet me tomorrow.

999
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:40,150
Go.

1000
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:55,390
He asked me to come.

1001
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:57,940
Who’s he? Address him as ‘Sir’.

1002
01:22:58,240 --> 01:22:59,320
Learn to give respect.

1003
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,390
What are you doing here today?

1004
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:02,910
He told you to come tomorrow.

1005
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,790
I didn’t want to waste time.

1006
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,700
Keep cleaning the car...

1007
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:07,830
Let me ask him.

1008
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:19,360
Hey!

1009
01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:20,470
Clean it.

1010
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:33,370
Come, he is calling you.

1011
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:13,430
Stop over acting...

1012
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:14,900
Pull the shirt button off.

1013
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:21,340
Come sit down.

1014
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:27,250
Sit down!

1015
01:24:32,690 --> 01:24:34,690
Now tell me. 
Which chapter is difficult for you?

1016
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:38,190
I don’t understand this.

1017
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:40,860
Don’t just say this.

1018
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,810
Call it ‘Sum’ or ‘Problem’.

1019
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:48,980
I see you’ve come this far in Math.

1020
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:50,860
You must be clever.

1021
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:52,280
Am I right?

1022
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:55,940
Someone must’ve told you 
this sum is important.

1023
01:24:59,150 --> 01:25:02,270
You don’t need important questions 
at this stage...

1024
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:04,540
Just basics.

1025
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,970
Let me ask you a basic question.

1026
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:08,170
Green.

1027
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:10,390
Brown. Black.

1028
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:14,650
If we place these colors in a sequence...

1029
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,850
What would be the 522nd color?

1030
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:29,560
Go home, solve it and meet me tomorrow 
at the same time.

1031
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:31,510
Go.

1032
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:40,760
Bring Math texts from 6 to 9 grades 
next time.

1033
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,130
Hi, sister!

1034
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:05,290
Who are you, man?

1035
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,450
Sister...

1036
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:15,110
I don’t understand this sum. 
Help me.

1037
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:17,790
I’m not here to clarify your doubts.

1038
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:22,190
I’m here to enjoy my short vacation 
in the IIT world.

1039
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,610
- Please! 
- Uh-huh.

1040
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:26,530
Help him...

1041
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:30,020
I paid his pre admission fee 
in National College already.

1042
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:33,730
What?! National College?

1043
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:34,840
Yes.

1044
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:37,150
Of course.

1045
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:40,360
You didn’t have money 
when I wanted to join.

1046
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:41,980
How did you manage now?

1047
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:43,940
Your son is your favorite.

1048
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:45,540
That’s not right.

1049
01:26:45,610 --> 01:26:50,310
I agreed because all his friends 
were joining there.

1050
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:54,010
Please, sister.

1051
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:54,890
Hmm.

1052
01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:58,220
Go bring your notebook.

1053
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:04,540
Did you solve that sum?

1054
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:08,290
I tried so hard. 
I couldn’t solve it at all.

1055
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:10,950
I tried too. I failed.

1056
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:13,620
There’s something wrong with this sum.

1057
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,120
Such difficult questions will not 
be in the exams...

1058
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,110
Forget it.

1059
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:19,790
- Hi. 
- Hey! Hi!

1060
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:37,210
You said there’s something wrong 
with the sum.

1061
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:38,230
See.

1062
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:41,290
Wow!

1063
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:46,450
Who told you about this?

1064
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:48,160
Vayunandan told me.

1065
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:52,000
Where’s the ice cream party?

1066
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,700
Oh. You told him about the treat too.

1067
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,090
Mom, bring me the pancakes quickly.

1068
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,160
Eat it.

1069
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:52,840
Yuck!

1070
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,910
Mom, the pancakes taste very bad.

1071
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:56,610
Hello!

1072
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:05,450
You don't like mom's pancakes?

1073
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:08,130
Pancake is great, mom.

1074
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:09,870
I was just kidding.

1075
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:18,610
I’m in IIT and I still don’t have 
a boyfriend...

1076
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,780
You have a girlfriend in 10th grade?

1077
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:22,280
Please give it back, sister. 
Please! Please!

1078
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,280
I will. First introduce her to me.

1079
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,660
No! No! Never!

1080
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:27,530
That’s not possible. 
No!

1081
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:29,610
Mommy!

1082
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:34,230
Hey!

1083
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,660
This is my sister Swetha.

1084
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:03,370
Hi.

1085
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:04,420
Hi.

1086
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,460
What’s up? Group studies?

1087
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:07,540
Hmm.

1088
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:09,230
Mahi is an expert in Math.

1089
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:12,140
He easily solves all the difficult sums.

1090
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:13,390
Hmm.

1091
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:17,640
He solved an impossible sum 
in a snap.

1092
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:20,890
And he solved it in just 4 steps.

1093
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:26,030
Verna is the smarter one in our batch 
after Mahi.

1094
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,420
Which college are you guys joining 
after 10th grade?

1095
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:35,380
Verna got a pre admission in National College.

1096
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:38,360
We’re yet to decide.

1097
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:51,930
I somehow feel you’re all grown up.

1098
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:56,700
You’ve decided on your college and girl.

1099
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:59,970
I don’t know how your future 
looks to you.

1100
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,300
Do you want to know how I see it?

1101
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:06,960
Verna will find out the truth about you 
and hate you.

1102
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:11,970
And you’re in pain from 
the whole incident.

1103
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:15,470
Think about it.

1104
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:22,760
Bye, grandma. I’ll be back soon.

1105
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:24,710
Okay, dear. Take care.

1106
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:25,790
Okay.

1107
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:28,060
Let’s go.

1108
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:30,670
Hey, Mahi! Sister is leaving. Let’s go.

1109
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:32,230
Come.

1110
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:41,590
Mahi!

1111
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,000
Mahi!

1112
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,830
I’m running late, mom. I’ll leave.

1113
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:51,100
Bye, mom.

1114
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:55,670
Swetha, stop!

1115
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:56,630
He’s here.

1116
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,970
How long are you going to manipulate her?

1117
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:15,130
She’ll have to find out someday.

1118
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:21,090
If you think she’ll never know...

1119
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:24,340
You’re the biggest fool.

1120
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:27,150
Bye.

1121
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:03,210
Here you go.

1122
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:07,090
6-7-8

1123
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:09,480
9... Good... Well done.

1124
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:11,640
Why do you need these now?

1125
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:14,200
Don’t you want my books next year?

1126
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:14,980
Yes.

1127
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:16,500
Then don’t ask me any questions.

1128
01:34:16,730 --> 01:34:17,440
- Hmm. 
- Bye!

1129
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:32,930
Do you know ‘Unworthy Alms’ mean?

1130
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:35,380
No, sir.

1131
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:36,430
Go find out.

1132
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:39,300
I don’t have a place for someone 
unpunctual.

1133
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:41,470
Sir, please. Sir! Sir!

1134
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,010
- No! 
- Sir! Sir, please.

1135
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:44,180
I’m so sorry, sir.

1136
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:47,510
I also brought 6 to 9 grade texts 
like you asked.

1137
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,660
Please, sir!

1138
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,620
Did you finish the homework?

1139
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:53,880
Yes.

1140
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:55,790
522nd color is Green, sir.

1141
01:34:55,950 --> 01:34:56,700
Hmm.

1142
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,120
How’d you solve it? Show me.

1143
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:09,830
What is this? Hmm?

1144
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:12,910
This reminds me of a real incident.

1145
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:14,850
A teacher in Germany

1146
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:21,040
Told his students to add numbers 
from 1 to 100...

1147
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:24,040
And asked them for an answer...

1148
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:37,460
Students immediately grabbed 
their pens and started adding...

1149
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:44,040
But a student gave him the answer 
in just 10 seconds...

1150
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:47,080
That sum would take a minimum 
of 10 minutes.

1151
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:52,580
Both the students and teacher 
were shocked.

1152
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:57,710
Assuming his answer is definitely wrong, 
teacher opened the notebook.

1153
01:35:58,650 --> 01:36:00,110
But the answer was right.

1154
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:06,000
That kid thought differently 
than everyone else.

1155
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:07,910
What did he do?

1156
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:13,750
He divided 1 to 100 numerals 
in 2 equal parts.

1157
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:16,250
1 to 50...

1158
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:17,960
51 to 100...

1159
01:36:18,370 --> 01:36:22,120
When he added the highest number 
100 to the lowest number...

1160
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:23,570
He got 101.

1161
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:27,960
Similarly, he added 99 and 2. 
The answer was 101.

1162
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:29,980
98 plus 3.

1163
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:32,620
The answer is again 101.

1164
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:41,620
He thus recognized he’d have 50 counts of 101.

1165
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:43,710
So what did he do?

1166
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,960
101 multiplied by 50.

1167
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:49,830
The answer was 5050.

1168
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,960
Mathematics involves lot of logic.

1169
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:04,050
Putting me aside... Is there another 
reason why Math disinterests you?

1170
01:37:05,630 --> 01:37:06,670
Come on, tell me.

1171
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:13,130
Every time you teach Math...

1172
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:19,050
I’d think to myself if I’d ever apply 
these in life.

1173
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:22,010
Do you speak English well?

1174
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:23,910
- Yes, sir. Every day. 
- Okay.

1175
01:37:24,350 --> 01:37:25,350
How old are you?

1176
01:37:25,770 --> 01:37:26,720
15.

1177
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:28,810
15 is Mathematics.

1178
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:31,440
English could be a International language.

1179
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,770
But Mathematics is a universal language.

1180
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:41,370
We just know the distance between 
Earth and Sun is 149.6 million kilometers

1181
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,730
But did you ever get a doubt 
how they measured it?

1182
01:37:45,190 --> 01:37:45,770
Hmm?

1183
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:46,810
No, sir.

1184
01:37:47,230 --> 01:37:48,440
Trigonometry.

1185
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:52,060
Through advanced trigonometry, 
you can measure any heights...

1186
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:54,390
Any distances from anywhere to anywhere.

1187
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:13,440
We use Math in several aspects 
without our knowledge.

1188
01:38:23,350 --> 01:38:25,890
We can’t imagine a world without Math.

1189
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:58,270
Correct answer.

1190
01:38:59,890 --> 01:39:01,600
Yes! I did it.

1191
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:02,980
I did it on my own.

1192
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:05,770
I did it! I... I... I did it!

1193
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:06,890
Yes!

1194
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:14,270
Mathematics is a universal language.

1195
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:40,850
Mommy!

1196
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:43,390
There’s no salt or spice.

1197
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:45,140
This is so bland.

1198
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:48,480
You’re so poor in Mathematics.

1199
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,100
Come. Let’s go for a short drive.

1200
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:26,310
Hey!

1201
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:30,130
Come on. Let’s play football.

1202
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:32,920
Come. Come.

1203
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:35,720
Bend it like Beckham! Come on!

1204
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:39,390
What are you thinking?

1205
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:40,710
- Sir... 
- Come on! Kick it!

1206
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,870
Come on, kick the ball.

1207
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:44,780
Ah, come on, man! Kick the ball!

1208
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,010
Do it now. Yes.

1209
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:50,670
There it is.

1210
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:52,490
Come on. One more time.

1211
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,510
Here comes the kick and...

1212
01:40:56,630 --> 01:40:58,760
Yes! It’s a goal!

1213
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:10,610
Mahi...

1214
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:15,150
Students must be having some 
nicknames for teachers...

1215
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,320
What’s mine?

1216
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:18,770
Hmm?

1217
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:20,160
Tell me.

1218
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:22,580
Come on.

1219
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:24,650
Ah, tell me. I won’t mind.

1220
01:41:25,110 --> 01:41:26,570
Now come on, tell me. No problem.

1221
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:31,610
Don’t hesitate. Tell me.

1222
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:33,570
Tell me.

1223
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:36,290
B...

1224
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:38,700
What’s that?

1225
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:42,370
[STAMMERS] B... Bussu sir.

1226
01:41:42,990 --> 01:41:44,010
Bussu?

1227
01:41:48,350 --> 01:41:50,310
Couldn’t you find a better name? Huh?

1228
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:52,980
Bussu?!

1229
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:54,300
It’s alright.

1230
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:57,260
We also had nicknames for our teachers 
in school.

1231
01:41:58,090 --> 01:41:59,130
Hey, boy. Pass the ball.

1232
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:01,390
Thanks, man.

1233
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:41,800
Here you go. Have some tea.

1234
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:04,500
Mommy, tea tastes great.

1235
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,550
Now you’re so good in Math.

1236
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,380
Didn’t Varna come today?

1237
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:19,970
She won’t be coming today. 
She has a stomachache.

1238
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:29,380
Walk slowly.

1239
01:43:29,690 --> 01:43:31,520
Keep to the left.

1240
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:33,900
Hi, grandma!

1241
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:35,300
Hi, Deepu.

1242
01:43:35,530 --> 01:43:36,660
Where’s Varna?

1243
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:38,650
She’s sleeping.

1244
01:43:58,260 --> 01:43:59,600
Hello, Princess!

1245
01:44:08,010 --> 01:44:09,140
What are you guys doing here?

1246
01:44:09,430 --> 01:44:11,300
We’re doing the group study 
at your place today.

1247
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,470
Guys, I'll tell you a joke...

1248
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:26,850
When a student saw the question paper 
in the exam hall...

1249
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:30,060
He was feeling bad as he doesn't know 
any answers...

1250
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:31,770
Then the examiner told him...

1251
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:34,920
To cover his paper as the person 
sitting behind him is copying.

1252
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:08,500
Hi, daddy!

1253
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:12,370
Hey, hero.

1254
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:14,080
Get ready... I'll drop you 
at the exam hall.

1255
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:25,290
In Part B... Let me see.

1256
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:28,920
Hooray! Exams are over.

1257
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:31,710
This is the happiest moment in my life.

1258
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:39,740
Stop being so obsessed!

1259
01:46:40,010 --> 01:46:42,340
Your exams are over.

1260
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:45,970
I’m interested in studying...

1261
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:47,910
Is that your problem?

1262
01:46:51,130 --> 01:46:52,310
Go on study...

1263
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:54,640
Oh, Lord!

1264
01:47:05,010 --> 01:47:06,080
Hey, Chinna!

1265
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:07,720
Ugh!

1266
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:12,680
What is it?

1267
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:16,400
Hire a servant to do 
all your chores.

1268
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:17,670
I can't do it anymore.

1269
01:47:33,310 --> 01:47:39,440
Your grandpa prayed to fulfill 
a ritual on your birth.

1270
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:42,450
His prayers came true.

1271
01:47:43,250 --> 01:47:45,080
But he couldn’t fulfill the ritual.

1272
01:47:46,290 --> 01:47:48,010
Every time he would save money...

1273
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:50,190
It would go into the house expenses.

1274
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:53,150
Years passed by...

1275
01:47:54,130 --> 01:47:57,840
It was soon before he passed away.

1276
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:06,430
Every time you ask when 
I’m going to my husband...

1277
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:12,760
I’d feel bad about not fulfilling 
his promise.

1278
01:48:14,510 --> 01:48:15,510
Grandma!

1279
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:23,090
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1280
01:48:24,970 --> 01:48:26,640
I can only love you...

1281
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:29,010
I can never hurt you.

1282
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:36,480
Here.

1283
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:39,110
The 2 rupees you threw away.

1284
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:42,810
Lord hopes for those very 2 rupees.

1285
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:51,490
Maybe Lord asks for my devotion 
instead of the ritual.

1286
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:57,110
You might have stolen money 
from the offering box.

1287
01:48:57,890 --> 01:49:02,010
But you bought me the books 
from your own pocket.

1288
01:49:03,380 --> 01:49:05,940
Fulfill the ritual on your own. Come.

1289
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:10,010
Let’s offer those books at the temple.

1290
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:45,430
Take it.

1291
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:47,000
Put it in the offering box.

1292
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:55,360
Results for 10th grade exams held 
from March 24th to April 9th are out.

1293
01:49:55,860 --> 01:50:02,110
Andhra Pradesh Education Minister announced 
them at the Secretariat at 10:40 am.

1294
01:50:02,250 --> 01:50:06,980
Sripathi Kumari topped with 591 marks.

1295
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:11,480
Avansha Varna came second 
with 587 marks.

1296
01:50:12,230 --> 01:50:13,340
Varna!

1297
01:50:17,490 --> 01:50:19,280
I knew you’d achieve it.

1298
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:23,550
Uncle, please check. Please!

1299
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:26,050
Looks like my brain is going to crash. 
Leave!

1300
01:50:26,170 --> 01:50:27,670
- No, uncle. Please. 
- I said step out!

1301
01:50:27,710 --> 01:50:28,800
Maintain queue.

1302
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:30,510
Stand in the line. Go.

1303
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:34,750
Hmm. Give it.

1304
01:50:35,570 --> 01:50:36,610
No.

1305
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:38,620
You go first.

1306
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,210
Ugh! Let’s do Rock-Paper-Scissors.

1307
01:50:42,530 --> 01:50:43,470
Umm... Okay.

1308
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:44,770
Rock-Paper-Scissors!

1309
01:50:46,110 --> 01:50:47,450
Rock-Paper-Scissors!

1310
01:50:48,110 --> 01:50:49,280
Oh no!

1311
01:51:04,370 --> 01:51:05,720
Here. Take it.

1312
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:06,870
Next.

1313
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,420
65, Math-67, Science-45...

1314
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:14,340
Total percentage-59.1!

1315
01:51:14,390 --> 01:51:16,390
- 59.1! Wow! 
- Here. Take it.

1316
01:51:19,260 --> 01:51:21,760
You passed... 
But your percentage is low.

1317
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:28,220
Bro, check in another site.

1318
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:33,900
73...

1319
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:35,430
Total percentage 65!

1320
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:45,210
0 in Math?! I cannot believe this.

1321
01:51:45,290 --> 01:51:48,580
What?! Mahi failed in Math?!

1322
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:50,580
No way!

1323
01:51:57,290 --> 01:51:58,400
Mommy...

1324
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:36,320
Question paper was easy, right?

1325
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:37,490
Why did you fail?

1326
01:52:38,450 --> 01:52:39,830
Was my training not enough?

1327
01:52:45,490 --> 01:52:46,870
What are you planning to do now?

1328
01:52:47,070 --> 01:52:49,130
I’ll write supplementary exams, sir.

1329
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:50,370
Hmm.

1330
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:52,580
What if the paper is tough and you fail?

1331
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:54,950
Hmm?

1332
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:57,490
Shall we apply for rechecking?

1333
01:52:57,830 --> 01:52:58,870
Rechecking?

1334
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:00,450
No, sir.

1335
01:53:01,090 --> 01:53:02,070
Why?

1336
01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:03,480
Why not?

1337
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:12,300
I feel you gave a blank answer sheet 
from the looks of it.

1338
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,830
I’m not taking a wild guess.

1339
01:53:18,790 --> 01:53:22,790
Your exam center Principal called me.

1340
01:53:24,420 --> 01:53:27,460
I was waiting for you to confess...

1341
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:29,290
But you were quiet...

1342
01:53:30,130 --> 01:53:34,250
‘Your student Mahi Teja couldn’t answer 
a single problem.’

1343
01:53:35,130 --> 01:53:39,010
‘Do you have such dull students 
in your class?’

1344
01:53:39,170 --> 01:53:40,710
I felt so insulted by his remarks.

1345
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:44,870
I checked your Math answer sheets.

1346
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:49,710
I don’t get why you didn’t attempt 
the sums you know.

1347
01:53:51,230 --> 01:53:58,590
I also enquired if Micro Artist Eega Damodar 
plays a part in this.

1348
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:01,690
But he was not there.

1349
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:03,520
I met his assistant Rafi...

1350
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:09,340
I threatened him and he told me 
your love story.

1351
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:14,830
That’s when I understood 
your game plan.

1352
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:22,680
You need to score 95 in Math 
to join National College.

1353
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:29,130
You checked the number of questions 
you can solve...

1354
01:54:30,270 --> 01:54:32,680
And realized you can’t score 95 percent.

1355
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:36,880
That’s when you got the supplementary 
exams idea.

1356
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:41,890
You won’t qualify for supplementary 
if you score 35 plus...

1357
01:54:42,770 --> 01:54:45,390
So, you've submitted blank papers.

1358
01:54:50,810 --> 01:54:54,390
I challenged myself, ignored my ethics...

1359
01:54:55,710 --> 01:54:58,080
Trying to get you through Math exam.

1360
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:04,850
But you wasted my efforts 
for a girl’s sake.

1361
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:08,720
I’m defeated because of you.

1362
01:55:09,970 --> 01:55:11,220
Go to hell!

1363
01:55:11,390 --> 01:55:12,480
Get out of here!

1364
01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:48,810
Hi!

1365
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:51,430
I can’t believe you failed.

1366
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:55,940
You clarified my doubts and 
I got a State rank.

1367
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,300
I still can’t believe this.

1368
01:56:59,870 --> 01:57:03,580
At least 10 corporate colleges 
are trying to reach me.

1369
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:05,460
One of them offered a free seat.

1370
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:09,460
While other offered a stipend.

1371
01:57:09,740 --> 01:57:10,860
Blah! Blah! Blah!

1372
01:57:11,090 --> 01:57:12,920
But I made a demand.

1373
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:15,460
Really? What is it?

1374
01:57:16,050 --> 01:57:21,170
I’d join the college that offers 
free seats to my friends as well.

1375
01:57:23,450 --> 01:57:24,360
You know something?

1376
01:57:24,450 --> 01:57:28,530
National College agreed to meet my demand.

1377
01:57:29,490 --> 01:57:32,110
Apply for a reevaluation 
without any delay...

1378
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:34,410
You just have to pass.

1379
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:37,110
We can all go to the same college.

1380
01:57:37,410 --> 01:57:41,070
Wow! This feeling is amazing.

1381
01:57:46,230 --> 01:57:47,730
Will you apply for reevaluation?

1382
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:50,260
Tell me! are you okay with it?

1383
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:52,260
Yes, okay.

1384
01:57:58,880 --> 01:57:59,770
Bye!

1385
01:58:55,030 --> 01:58:56,930
'We can all go to the same college.'

1386
01:58:57,030 --> 01:58:59,270
Go to hell! Get out of here!

1387
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:05,270
Hey, Mahi!

1388
01:59:05,940 --> 01:59:07,020
Come here.

1389
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:11,960
- Sir... 
- Get into the car.

1390
01:59:12,290 --> 01:59:13,350
Come.

1391
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:27,990
I’d scold you all the time.

1392
01:59:29,150 --> 01:59:34,070
Did you ever wonder why 
I offered to tutor you?

1393
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:37,570
I thought you called me home 
to beat me up, sir.

1394
01:59:44,710 --> 01:59:47,170
My wife lives in Bangalore now.

1395
01:59:47,700 --> 01:59:49,460
She chose not to stay with me.

1396
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:53,130
She whined a lot about me 
before she left.

1397
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:56,890
You had the same complaints 
in the staff room.

1398
01:59:57,670 --> 01:59:59,750
'You’re life is a routine…'

1399
02:00:00,170 --> 02:00:01,650
'Even if you live for a thousand years…'

1400
02:00:01,790 --> 02:00:03,250
'It doesn’t make any difference.'

1401
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,800
When my wife yelled at me,

1402
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:08,250
I considered it her fault.

1403
02:00:09,150 --> 02:00:11,410
But when you said the same things to me...

1404
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:14,750
I realized maybe I am to blame.

1405
02:00:15,610 --> 02:00:21,610
Accepting my mistakes in your presence...

1406
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:26,050
I tried really hard to be positive 
towards my wife.

1407
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:32,590
But no matter what, 
that hatred I feel for my wife...

1408
02:00:33,710 --> 02:00:34,880
I can’t lose it.

1409
02:00:36,510 --> 02:00:39,250
But I had so many sweet memories with her.

1410
02:00:45,230 --> 02:00:46,770
She was my college junior...

1411
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:49,090
I loved her at first sight.

1412
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:55,250
I’d get into fights on purpose and 
beat people up.

1413
02:00:56,690 --> 02:00:57,810
Do you know why?

1414
02:00:58,530 --> 02:01:00,610
Just to catch her attention.

1415
02:01:01,100 --> 02:01:04,600
One day I saved her from 
seniors ragging her.

1416
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:06,990
And she shook my hand to thank me.

1417
02:01:08,050 --> 02:01:10,010
I proposed to her that day itself.

1418
02:01:11,250 --> 02:01:14,000
She took a week’s time and 
accepted me.

1419
02:01:15,170 --> 02:01:19,710
Every moment with her has been 
joyful ever since.

1420
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:24,540
We got married to experience 
the joy of a lifetime.

1421
02:01:26,130 --> 02:01:30,750
I was very happy to marry 
the love of my life.

1422
02:01:32,290 --> 02:01:35,790
But that happiness faded in 5 years.

1423
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,130
Compliments turned into complaints.

1424
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:48,710
If you hope your first love stays 
with you forever...

1425
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:52,040
Happiness might or might not last.

1426
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:56,330
But if she stays in your heart forever...

1427
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,670
That happiness lasts for a lifetime.

1428
02:02:02,130 --> 02:02:04,710
Every time you think of your first crush...

1429
02:02:05,790 --> 02:02:07,670
Your heart skips a beat.

1430
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:12,920
I’m saying this with experience.

1431
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:14,820
Listen to me...

1432
02:02:15,790 --> 02:02:20,500
Memories of first love are sweet 
only if you part ways.

1433
02:02:22,290 --> 02:02:24,080
I don’t have the chance anymore.

1434
02:02:25,580 --> 02:02:26,650
But you do...

1435
02:02:26,830 --> 02:02:27,920
Mark my words...

1436
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:32,630
The important thing in first love 
is not winning...

1437
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:36,790
But keeping that emotion alive 
until you die.

1438
02:02:41,930 --> 02:02:45,510
You will top the supplementary 
like you wished.

1439
02:02:46,380 --> 02:02:47,750
I will tutor you.

1440
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:51,000
But you should make me a promise.

1441
02:02:52,210 --> 02:02:55,910
You shouldn’t join the college she does.

1442
02:03:04,290 --> 02:03:06,460
'I don’t know how your future 
looks to you.'

1443
02:03:06,630 --> 02:03:08,170
'Want to know how it looks to me?'

1444
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:12,170
'Varna will find out the truth about you 
and hate you.'

1445
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:15,130
'And you’re in pain from 
the whole incident.'

1446
02:03:15,790 --> 02:03:18,630
'If you think she’ll never know...'

1447
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:21,000
'You’re the biggest fool on Earth.'

1448
02:03:24,450 --> 02:03:28,660
'Memories of first love are sweet only 
if you part ways.'

1449
02:03:29,290 --> 02:03:30,330
'I promise.'

1450
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,250
'You will top the supplementary 
like you wished.'

1451
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:34,750
'I will tutor you.'

1452
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:38,210
Hmm. Come on.

1453
02:03:38,670 --> 02:03:39,690
Promise me.

1454
02:03:44,860 --> 02:03:48,480
"A meek smile that lures me"

1455
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:52,470
"Let me treasure it for a lifetime"

1456
02:03:52,850 --> 02:03:56,390
"All the memories that amuse me"

1457
02:03:56,780 --> 02:04:00,700
"Let them linger all through my life"

1458
02:04:00,850 --> 02:04:08,280
"You're the suprise 
that stole my heart"

1459
02:04:08,870 --> 02:04:16,670
"You've turned this 
young boy into a Prince"

1460
02:04:48,690 --> 02:04:51,560
Hey! Why are you solving Math again?

1461
02:04:51,690 --> 02:04:53,490
Didn’t you apply for reevaluation?

1462
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:55,680
- No. 
- Why?

1463
02:04:56,770 --> 02:04:58,480
My Math teacher asked me not to.

1464
02:04:58,810 --> 02:04:59,810
Why?

1465
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:03,370
If I clear the reevaluation by any chance...

1466
02:05:03,930 --> 02:05:06,260
I won’t be eligible for supplementary...

1467
02:05:07,230 --> 02:05:09,770
He said supplementary was my best option.

1468
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:13,610
10th grade scores are really 
important, right?

1469
02:05:14,290 --> 02:05:16,330
They reflect greatly on my life.

1470
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:20,910
That is why I decided to appear 
for the supplementary.

1471
02:05:23,210 --> 02:05:26,980
Anyway, we as friends don’t have to join 
the same college.

1472
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:29,270
Even if we join different colleges...

1473
02:05:29,730 --> 02:05:31,480
We can still be good friends.

1474
02:07:03,160 --> 02:07:06,220
"Memories of first love 
when faded suddenly"

1475
02:07:07,250 --> 02:07:08,370
"They're often sweet"
