1
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,920
One...two...three...four.

2
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,440
Total four holes!

3
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,120
The air is getting blocked.
The air is getting blocked.

4
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,920
Don't block the air, don't block the air.
Move!

5
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,200
Oh, sorry.
Sorry, sorry!

6
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,560
-Idiot!
-Extremely sorry.

7
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,240
My mind doesn't work properly
unless I take in the London air.

8
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,840
Anyway, tell me
what you were saying.

9
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,440
I was saying that there are four holes
in this man's body.

10
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,880
Bullet.

11
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,960
I can see that.

12
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,760
Why did you call me
for a case like this?

13
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,440
Actually sir, we can't understand
through which hole...

14
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,640
the bullet entered
and caused his death.

15
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,000
Of course.

16
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,480
Who better than a Bengali
to find loopholes?

17
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,720
Hmm.

18
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,520
What about the letter I sent to the Queen,
asking her to cook pumpkin curry?

19
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,240
Oh yes, sir.
Yes, yes, yes.

20
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,360
Queen Victoria is cooking pumpkin...
what do you call...curry for you herself.

21
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,080
That's good.

22
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,160
So, did you find
any blackmail letter?

23
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,960
Blackmail? Letter?
No.

24
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,360
What about a cryptic riddle?

25
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,640
No.

26
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,360
Finger print?

27
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,160
No, sir.

28
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,960
What the hell!

29
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,680
No blackmail letters,
no cryptic riddles...

30
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,720
No finger print either.
How is a detective supposed to investigate?

31
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,720
I'm forced to say that...

32
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,240
-this is a conspiracy against detectives.
-Hmm.

33
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,760
It is acceptable in a backward country
like India.

34
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,160
But this is not expected
from an advanced country like yours!

35
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,480
We are extremely sorry, sir.

36
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,840
Actually, going forward we'll circulate
a notice in the city.

37
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,960
-Especially for potential murderers.
-Damn it!

38
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,880
Yes, please circulate a notice.

39
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
Make sure it clearly states...

40
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,280
That there can be no murder
without threats, riddles or finger prints.

41
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,920
Or else, the murder
shall be considered illegal!

42
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,040
Right.

43
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,680
If there's a murder
with no clue left behind...

44
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,280
it will be not be recognised
in the eyes of the law.

45
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,360
Absolutely right, sir.

46
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,880
-Any traces poison in the body?
-Poison in the food?

47
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,080
But the death
is because of gun shots.

48
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,960
Okay, maybe there was no poison in food
but it could be food poisoning.

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,200
-Oh.
-Do you know if he had diarrhea?

50
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,360
No.

51
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,960
-Was the urine yellow?
-No, sir.

52
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,400
What the hell were you doing, then?
Whiling your time away?

53
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,960
He has been shot dead.

54
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,320
-Four holes!
-Shut up!

55
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,840
My God!

56
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,640
"Four holes!"

57
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,520
Idiot!

58
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,640
If there was excessive gas formation
in the stomach...

59
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,200
How would it escape?
Wouldn't it burst out of these holes?

60
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,160
Just cares about the holes.
Thinks he's a know-it-all!

61
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,320
Here it is!

62
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,080
But you said there were no clues.

63
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,360
What does it signify, sir?

64
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,080
Four spots on this card.

65
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,360
And four holes in the body.

66
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,880
I see.

67
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,760
See how I put
two and two together?

68
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,840
This card is a clue
to finding the murderer.

69
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,600
Then what about food poisoning?

70
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,800
Food poisoning canceled.

71
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,000
Detective Mahimchandra will
catch the murderer with just this card.

72
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,800
Just wait and watch.

73
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,240
Watson?

74
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,720
Watson?

75
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,760
Watson!

76
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,080
Watson!

77
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,800
Watson.

78
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,320
Watson?

79
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,200
-Hey! Bloody Watson!
-Huh?

80
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,720
-One moment, sir.
-Watson!

81
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,880
-Watson!
-It's Hutashon, sir.

82
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,720
A four of clubs in the victim's pocket
and four holes in the body.

83
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,200
We must get going, Watson.
Let's go!

84
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,480
Sir, I'm Hutashon.
How many times do I need to repeat myself?

85
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,640
-Sir!
-Hey! Don't you dare run away...

86
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,040
Huh?

87
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,880
Sign here.

88
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,880
-When did I return from London?
-London?

89
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,920
When did you go to London?

90
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,640
You've been rotting away
at this detective agency for ages.

91
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,280
-Damn it!
-London!

92
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,840
You wouldn't believe
what an interesting case I'd found, Watson.

93
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,200
Wake up from your daydream, sir.

94
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,440
The commissioner called you
a long time ago.

95
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,680
I didn't wake you up.

96
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,880
-Okay, it'll be done.
-Let's go.

97
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,040
Come on.

98
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,400
Mahim, this is going beyond all limit.

99
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,280
Why aren't you paying attention
to your work?

100
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,720
What's your problem?

101
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,280
What to do, sir?
What can I do?

102
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,480
I never find a case interesting enough
to nourish my mind.

103
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,880
-No nutrition in mind.
-Shut up!

104
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,360
You've done a great job
in arresting those Swadeshi terrorists.

105
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,480
Thank you.

106
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,400
I want you to keep up
the same performance.

107
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,000
Now, take this up.

108
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,840
His name is Raktambar Dhar.

109
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,800
We have been keeping an eye on him.

110
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,680
Every day, the boy stands on the road
in the darkness...

111
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,800
when the District Mmagistrate's carriage
passes.

112
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,680
We suspect that the boy is planning
to kill the District Magistrate.

113
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,120
Track him down.

114
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,000
I want you to catch him red-handed.

115
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,560
Understand?

116
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
Hey!

117
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,920
We went a few days back.

118
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,560
Damn it!
I'm sick of this job.

119
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,200
Absolutely right, sir.

120
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,040
It's such an absurd job.

121
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,200
I can't even tell my wife
what exactly I do.

122
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Even my wife has tried to ask me
in a lot of ways.

123
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
-You know what I do then?
-What?

124
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,880
I tactfully avoid it.

125
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,320
Oh.
But beware, sir.

126
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,440
Your wife isn't a simpleton like mine.
She's an educated woman.

127
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,960
-Someday she'll catch you.
-Huh! It's not that easy.

128
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,640
If you don't mind
can I say something?

129
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,120
-Can I?
-Tell me!

130
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,920
You got married recently, sir.

131
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,240
Instead of reading detective novels
all day

132
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,640
spend some time with your wife.

133
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,080
And focus on your work.

134
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,880
Take it.

135
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
Hmmph!

136
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,440
What's wrong, Sudhamukhi?

137
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,120
It's getting dark, why haven't you
turned on the lights yet?

138
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,200
I was just about to.

139
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,600
Sudhamukhi, how about a round of cards?

140
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,680
Sure, you get the deck out.
I'll be right there.

141
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,680
Okay--
Tell me something...

142
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,600
Why do you light a lantern
every evening?

143
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,400
-Well, the other day I saw a scorpion...
-Oh.

144
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,960
That's why I keep an eye out
every evening.

145
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,080
-Sneha?
-Yes?

146
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,080
Did your brother say
when he'll be back?

147
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,080
That crackpot is very unpredictable.

148
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,440
-You come.
-Hmm.

149
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,880
Sir, this is the street.

150
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,440
And here is that lamppost...

151
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,200
where Raktambar waits every day
to assassinate the Magistrate.

152
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,160
Raktambar is
a hardened criminal, you know.

153
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,080
Huh!
He's giving the British sleepless nights.

154
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,480
If we can catch him--

155
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,600
I mean, if you can catch him...

156
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,040
then your promotion
will be guaranteed.

157
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,840
GENERAL STRIKE
ON OCTOBER 16

158
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,760
I'll know what's on his mind
as soon as I see him.

159
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,840
(humming)

160
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,720
-Sneha?
-Hmm?

161
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,960
Why does your brother come home
so late at night?

162
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,080
What does he do?
Do you know?

163
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,960
How would I know?

164
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,600
You're his wife.
Doesn't he tell you anything?

165
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,240
He tells me he's a tax recovery agent
for the government.

166
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,840
Who does he collect tax from
so late at night?

167
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,200
-Sir, look at him. That's--
-Say no more.

168
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,040
-I recognise him.
-Ah.

169
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,040
The unibrow means
he's a violent criminal.

170
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,480
Criminals often have a beard
to hide the scars on their face.

171
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,120
-But sir, he's the post--
-Hush!

172
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,760
Don't waste time on relative matters
like the past, present and future, Watson.

173
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,640
-Let's follow him.
-Follow who?

174
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,160
Raktambar Dhar, of course.

175
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,000
He looks like
a very talented murderer.

176
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,320
Hey! Turn away.
Hide yourself!

177
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,320
-But this is Chidam.
-Who?

178
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,440
The post office peon, Chidam.

179
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,680
That letter the commissioner posted
never reached ma'am.

180
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,000
Please let us ask him
where the letter is?

181
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,320
Are you mocking me?
Huh?

182
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,200
Chidam!

183
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,920
-Sneha?
-Yes?

184
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,960
Has your brother always been like this?

185
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,160
Like what?
Crazy?

186
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,840
Tell me, you mean girl!

187
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,360
Tell me, when your father
fixed your marriage...

188
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,680
why didn't he get
my brother's brain tested?

189
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,680
-Oh God!
-These mosquitoes!

190
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,480
Uff!

191
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,720
-Sir?
-Yes?

192
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Look.

193
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,040
-Where?
-There.

194
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,720
-Who's this?
-Raktambar Dhar.

195
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,080
I recognised him
the moment I saw him.

196
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,080
His clean-shaven face proves
that he has a scheming mind.

197
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,880
But you just said that criminals
have unibrows and beards.

198
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,880
Who's the detective here, Watson?

199
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,080
It's you, sir.

200
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,160
So who will decide if criminals
are bearded or clean-shaven?

201
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,400
You, sir.

202
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,440
-Then follow me.
-Who will you follow?

203
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,320
The man is just standing there.

204
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,640
Follow me means...

205
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,400
-Follow my orders.
-Oh.

206
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,320
I've told you so many times
to sharpen that thick brain of yours.

207
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,840
Look, look, look!

208
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,040
-I'm sure he's carrying a bomb.
-To kill whom?

209
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,840
Well, the District Magistrate
will pass this area soon.

210
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,520
-So let's go stop him!
-Uff!

211
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,680
You're working at a detective agency
with an empty brain?

212
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,440
If we catch him now
will you be able to prove

213
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,720
that he intended to commit murder?

214
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,160
The moment he's about to
throw the bomb...

215
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,160
Oh my God!

216
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,320
But by then, the Magistrate
will be dead!

217
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,800
So what can I do about it?

218
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,400
How strange!

219
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,040
I have simply been asked
to prove that he intends to murder.

220
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,640
I haven't received any orders
to prevent the murder.

221
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,360
Watson, I just got married.
I don't want to risk losing my job now.

222
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,760
I don't feel
like playing anymore.

223
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,240
Tell me something,
what kind of parents do you have?

224
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,680
They married you to a man only because
he's wealthy and has a government job?

225
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,880
Why?

226
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
Your brother is no less
than any other man.

227
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,680
How sweet!

228
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,840
Sudhamukhi, do you
make love at night?

229
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,520
You're becoming cheeky
by the day, Sneha.

230
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,440
-Why? Come on, please tell me.
-Sneha.

231
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,400
-Please tell me?
-Sneha!

232
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,880
-Tell me, come on!
-Don't do this.

233
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,440
-Tell me, tell me!
-Sneha, stop--

234
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,720
-Please tell me!
-Don't, Sneha. Stop it!

235
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,680
-Why are you doing this?
-Why are you feeling so shy? Just tell me!

236
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,320
Sudhamukhi?

237
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,560
I'd tell you
if there was something to say.

238
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,640
-Sir.
-Hmm?

239
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,760
Sir!
That's the Magistrate's carriage.

240
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,240
Hmm.

241
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,360
GENERAL STRIKE
ON OCTOBER 16

242
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,680
Raktambar, bring out the bomb.
Throw it!

243
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,720
Come on, Raktambar, do it!
Take out the bomb! Throw it at the carriage!

244
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,360
Throw it!

245
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,800
-Watson?
-Yes?

246
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,360
-What just happened?
-He didn't kill today, sir.

247
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,960
-There you are, Doctor.
-Raktambar?

248
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,480
-Yes.
-I got a little delayed.

249
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,600
Oh.

250
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,240
I couldn't make it
the last two days.

251
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,200
How can I leave all my patients
at the dispensary and come here?

252
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,640
And why do you feel embarrassed
to go to the dispensary, Raktambar?

253
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,240
How can I help it, Doctor?

254
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,920
Your dispensary and my in-laws' place
are in the same neighbourhood.

255
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,280
If I go there...

256
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,160
everyone will get to know
about my hemorrhoids.

257
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,800
Oh, that's true.

258
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,640
Doctor, this has my stool sample.

259
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,040
Please conduct a test
and see what's wrong.

260
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,920
I spend six hours
of my day in the toilet!

261
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,160
-Yuck!
-It's such a pain.

262
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,360
-Disgusting!
-I don't know what to do.

263
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,560
Disgusting! Disgusting!

264
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,880
-Disgusting!
-Where are you going?

265
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,120
Fool! Imbecile!
Nincompoop!

266
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,040
You have the potential to be
an ideal criminal.

267
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,000
And you're spending
a quarter of your day on the toilet?

268
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,600
You jackass!

269
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,600
When will we have a real criminal
in this damned country of ours, doctor?

270
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,680
-Who are you, huh?
-Hey!

271
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,720
-Are you here to lecture me, huh?
-Keep that away from me.

272
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,240
-Can you feel my pain?
-Remove that.

273
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,920
-Want to see?
-Keep it away! No, no, no!

274
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,680
-Don't you dare!
-Hey! Run!

275
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,960
-Want to see how bad it hurts?
-Sir, watch your step!

276
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,080
-Sir! Get up!
-Oh God!

277
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,680
-Hurry, or he'll throw his s**t at us!
-Lets go!

278
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,520
-What a failure this investigation was.
-All because of that haemorrhoid patient.

279
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,240
-Will he still throw it at us?
-No need to look back. Let's go.

280
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,360
Oh no!
What a deep gash!

281
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,160
What kind of a job is this?

282
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,880
Why do you have to recover money
at this hour?

283
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,400
You don't know
how cunning this client is.

284
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,080
Even the British government is scared
of recovering money from him.

285
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,360
-Mahim?
-Hmm?

286
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,600
You don't lie to me, right?

287
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,640
Why should I lie to you?

288
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,840
We hardly spend time
with each other.

289
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,800
Don't you ever feel
suspicious of me?

290
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,760
Sudhamukhi, it's my job
to be suspicious of people.

291
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,800
Tracking who paid up, how much is owed.
I'd rather not bring it home.

292
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,560
But it's not my job.

293
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,880
It's my nature
to be suspicious.

294
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,040
If you give me any opportunity
to suspect you...

295
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,480
I won't let it go.

296
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,560
(song playing)

297
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,800
Uff!

298
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,080
GENERAL STRIKE
ON OCTOBER 16

299
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,840
-How many are we done with?
-About ten.

300
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,560
Sudha...here?

301
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,360
-Where's the Professor?
-Just a minute.

302
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,360
BENGAL IS FOR HINDUS AND MUSLIMS
NO ONE CAN DIVIDE US

303
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,760
What's the matter?

304
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,080
Don't come here unannounced, Sudhamukhi.

305
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,720
This can get the entire group
into trouble.

306
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm sorry, Professor.

307
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,720
Actually, I couldn't help it
when I heard the news.

308
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,880
-Is it true, Professor?
-Hmm.

309
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,520
Lord Curzon wants to divide
our beloved Bengal to pieces.

310
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,040
The British government wants to create
a divide between Hindus and Muslims here.

311
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,000
But we aren't taking it lying down.

312
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,400
We're getting ready
to give them a befitting reply.

313
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,120
The group is growing
in strength, right?

314
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,080
Hmm.
It is.

315
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,640
And it'll grow even bigger.

316
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,800
Boys and girls from every household
in Bengal are joining hands with us

317
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,800
to bring this conspiracy
to a halt.

318
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,360
Professor...

319
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,040
Can't you take me back
into the group?

320
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,440
No.

321
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,640
A revolution calls for a monk's mind...

322
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,040
and a warrior's promptness.

323
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,360
Women and gold
weakens a revolutionary's heart.

324
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,560
So a revolutionary
can't have any feelings?

325
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,840
I don't want to argue
with you, Sudhamukhi.

326
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,920
We are engaged
in something very significant.

327
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,160
It calls for strict restraint.

328
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,200
I have seen great potential
go to waste.

329
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,920
I can't let that happen again.

330
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,080
(indistinct chatter)

331
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,480
Very well.

332
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,600
When you've already decided
not to let a woman into the group...

333
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,880
Then don't refuse the gold,
at least, Professor.

334
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,440
If my cursed beauty
is in the way of our country's service...

335
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,560
then let me reduce my sorrow
by providing some money.

336
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,680
I have a husband
who works for the government.

337
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,280
Let me be of some use
to my country.

338
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,480
Please don't turn me away, Professor.

339
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,040
What are you doing?

340
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,440
Ruining my own
and my country's future.

341
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,840
You know, my father said
he won't let me study anymore.

342
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,720
What?

343
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,360
What do you mean?

344
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,720
He says that it's not good
for girls to get an education.

345
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,640
He can't stand Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar.

346
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,960
But then...

347
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,920
But then, how will we meet?

348
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,440
Mother found your letter
under my pillow.

349
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,520
Since then,
Father has been looking for a suitor.

350
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,080
And...
And you'll agree to it?

351
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,040
Don't you get a say?

352
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,680
You need independence
to express your own opinion.

353
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,400
So first, we must
make a firm demand for it.

354
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,280
Sudhamukhi, Abani had come here.

355
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,120
He just spoke me.

356
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,160
My father?

357
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,240
What did he say?

358
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,680
He doesn't want you
to continue with your studies.

359
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,560
So, he told me
to forbid you from coming here.

360
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,400
What should I do, Professor?

361
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,360
Until the country becomes independent...

362
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,480
you should accept your family's wishes
like an obedient daughter.

363
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,160
How can you say this?

364
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,640
You may go now, Sudhamukhi.

365
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,720
Wait, Manmatha.

366
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,280
I need to talk to you alone.

367
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,760
I have been informed that...

368
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,040
you didn't attend the Swaraj Samiti meeting
day before yesterday.

369
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,640
Why?

370
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,400
-I had some personal work.
-Don't lie, Manmatha.

371
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,440
Service to the country
is above all other work.

372
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,760
It was a mistake to involve you in this
with your weak resolve.

373
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,000
Weak?

374
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,320
-I'm weak, Professor?
-Certainly.

375
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,920
Jatin told me that instead of attending
the meeting day before yesterday...

376
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,840
you had taken Sudhamukhi
to the theatre in the evening.

377
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,520
Wow!

378
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,320
The boys are spying on me
instead of serving the nation.

379
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,560
That too is a service
to the nation.

380
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:23,640
The reason for you to agree
to discontinue Sudhamukhi studies...

381
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,320
is now clear to me.

382
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,640
But stifling the heart
and turning people into machines...

383
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,640
can't bring about a revolution.

384
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,320
I learnt this from you, Professor.

385
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,160
Goodbye.

386
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,280
-Mahim?
-Who's there?

387
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Oh.

388
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,920
Won't you go to sleep?

389
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,600
Yes.

390
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,080
Sudhamukhi.

391
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,920
You read the papers.

392
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,800
Can you tell me why the criminals
in our country are so stupid and cowardly?

393
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,800
And just look at their crimes.

394
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,600
They're harmless, straightforward.

395
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,560
Let's hope it stays this way.

396
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,720
-It's not nice if crimes are on the rise.
-What's wrong with you, Sudhamukhi!

397
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,280
Read these books.

398
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,640
They commit such beautifully twisted
psychological murders abroad.

399
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,160
They probe into the dark recesses
of the human mind.

400
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,440
And here?
Rubbish!

401
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,560
Why do even need to probe
into the dark recesses?

402
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,000
Are you serious?

403
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,080
Sudhamukhi, bloodshed involves a...

404
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,240
terrible, monstrous madness
which you can't even imagine.

405
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,840
When will the wretched people
of country get a taste of it?

406
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,160
Look at the frauds here.

407
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,680
They commit crimes
and ineptly get caught in their own traps.

408
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,880
I caught one of them
at Burrabazar the other day.

409
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,640
What do you mean by "caught"?

410
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,000
I mean, I read about it.

411
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,480
I mean, I read it
in the papers.

412
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,120
Let's go in.

413
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,520
Something looks suspicious
about this death, Chhaganlal.

414
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,200
Who told you that, Detective?

415
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,680
There's no scope for suspicion.

416
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,680
The terrible heat!
My goodness!

417
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,120
My younger brother
couldn't tolerate it.

418
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,000
He suffered a heart attack
and he left us all.

419
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,560
But your servants said that a few days ago,
you and your brother...

420
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,240
fought over the partition
of your iron business.

421
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,680
-Who's the detective here?
-You, sir.

422
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,720
-Then who will interrogate?
-You.

423
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,920
Hmm.

424
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,520
As I was saying...

425
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,120
Is it true, what Watson just said?

426
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,440
Apparently, he said
that he wouldn't give his brother...

427
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,160
any share of the business.

428
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,680
I'll shut up now.

429
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,120
I swear on God.

430
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,160
It's a lie, Detective.

431
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,120
I told him that after returning
from Haridwar...

432
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,160
I'll divide the business
into two parts.

433
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,280
Huh.

434
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,280
-You're saying the truth, aren't you?
-I swear on God!

435
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,960
I swear it's a hundred percent true.

436
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,640
Where have you gone, Maganlal...

437
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,200
-Chhaganlal.
-Yes?

438
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,480
You turned out
to be a true devotee.

439
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,840
Your gods are here
to bear witness for your statement.

440
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,480
-Huh?
-Come take a look.

441
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,760
-Come take a look.
-Really?

442
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,800
-Huh? Let me see.
-Here it is.

443
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,520
Huh?

444
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,640
What the hell?

445
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,960
What the hell!

446
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,600
-Do you wear your rings the wrong side in?
-Yes, it's comfortable that way.

447
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,840
Otherwise, it hurts.

448
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,160
-Damn it!
-Huh?

449
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,080
-And you're admitting it too!
-Yes.

450
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,840
-Oh no!
-Who named you Chhaganlal?

451
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,960
Your should be
called "Chhagallal"!

452
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,120
What does that mean?

453
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,240
It means you're
as dumb as sheep!

454
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,120
Sir, he's vegetarian.

455
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,640
A goat, then.

456
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
-Right.
-What?

457
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,040
You murdered someone
with an empty brain like that, huh?

458
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,480
-Rubbish!
-No, wait a minute.

459
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,040
Tell me frankly.

460
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,520
Did you do it
or was it someone else?

461
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,760
You did it?

462
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,080
Damn it!

463
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,880
Just see, he's admitting it to me!

464
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,720
Ridiculous!

465
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,560
Has your brain stopped working?
What do you think of me?

466
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,760
-I don't want to hear another word.
-You dare to threaten Chhaganlal?

467
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,680
-Let go, brother! Let go of me!
-I'll strangle you.

468
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,760
I'll finish you off.

469
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,800
-Shame on you!
-Shame on you!

470
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,480
Shame on you! Shame on you!
Shame on you!

471
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,080
He was a very dishonest man, Detective.

472
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,440
He had ruined my business.

473
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,320
Detective, please forgive me
just this one time.

474
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,360
I'll never murder
with my rings on again.

475
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,360
-Never again.
-Chhaganlal, listen to me.

476
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,520
Try to understand
my disappointment here.

477
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,840
It's great that you murdered your brother.

478
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,200
It's great that you killed
that cheat.

479
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,560
-But--
-Chhaganlal, don't you know about gloves?

480
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,120
You could have worn gloves
before killing him!

481
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,920
Hey! Why didn't you buy gloves?

482
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,920
Why didn't you buy them, huh?

483
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,600
Were you saving up
for an offering to God after death?

484
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,280
Couldn't you wear the ring
the right way up, you idiot?

485
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,360
Exactly.

486
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,080
I'm sorry.
I made a huge mistake.

487
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,960
I'll never make these mistakes again.

488
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,080
It's alright.
Don't cry, Chhaganlal.

489
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,080
God knows when this cursed country
will see a shrewd criminal.

490
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,240
-Watson.
-Yes, sir?

491
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,920
Take him away.

492
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,560
Go, Chhaganlal.

493
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,040
What's taking you so long?
Get up!

494
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,400
Come!

495
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
Out!

496
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,400
Sure your master was the one
who killed him?

497
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,600
Yes, sir.

498
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,840
Sudhamukhi.

499
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,840
Won't you go to bed?

500
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,400
Call him.

501
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
What...

502
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,680
Hurry up.

503
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,320
Hmm.

504
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,600
Mahim?

505
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,200
-Mahim?
-Hmm?

506
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,320
Are you going
to continue reading?

507
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,040
It's very late.
Let's go to bed.

508
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,920
Yes.

509
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,480
-Sudhamukhi?
-Hmm?

510
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,800
When will people write novels
on Bengali detectives too?

511
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,920
And housewives like you won't have to
waste time sleeping at night.

512
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,400
Instead, you can sharpen your wit
by reading them.

513
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,280
Bengal is about to see
worse days.

514
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,760
Lord Curzon has ordered
the Partition of Bengal.

515
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,600
Are you even aware of it?

516
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,720
Why should I?

517
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,200
These are political issues.
My job to is to deal with criminals.

518
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,440
I mean, tax frauds.

519
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,280
Do you like being subjugated
by the British?

520
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,640
Why?

521
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,880
What's wrong with the British?

522
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,440
They've educated the people
of our country.

523
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,480
Abolished horrible traditions
like "Sati", burning the widow.

524
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,200
They've allowed women to study,
introduced the railways...

525
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,120
And most importantly, they've produced
a detective like Sherlock Holmes.

526
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,440
And that's done us
a load of good.

527
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,360
What about occupying
and exploiting our nation?

528
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,400
What about the merciless torture
of those wanting freedom?

529
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,000
Oh dear!

530
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,760
It's fine that you're saying this to me
behind closed doors.

531
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,840
But don't say it
to anyone else.

532
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,200
Look, Sudhamukhi.
We have recently got married.

533
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,600
We have just started
our family life.

534
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,560
I can't lose my job now.

535
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,080
Go to sleep.

536
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,760
Where are you off to?

537
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,360
I'm reading a very interesting
detective novel.

538
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,600
I won't be able to sleep
until I finish it.

539
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,320
Read it on the bed.

540
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,320
But won't it disturb your sleep?

541
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,760
You sleep.
I'll go over there.

542
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,840
Sudhamukhi.

543
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,520
Oh shoot!

544
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,800
Who is it?

545
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,360
Sudhamukhi.

546
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,320
I'm not at home
most of the time.

547
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,160
Always keep the front door locked.

548
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,200
Huh.

549
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,920
You do worry about me, then?

550
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,320
Oh please!
Are you serious?

551
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,640
How can I not worry about you?
You're my...

552
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,440
...better half.

553
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,680
Actually...

554
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,680
I've been noticing something strange
for the last few days.

555
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,800
Tea, please.

556
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,320
Sir, your tea.

557
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,320
What's wrong?

558
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,680
What have you been noticing?

559
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,160
A genius.

560
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,400
Maybe Bengal's cursed days
are finally coming to an end, Sudhamukhi.

561
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,400
Sudhamukhi, your clothes are in that room.

562
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,640
Hmm.

563
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,160
-Don't be too late.
-Okay.

564
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Sudha.

565
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,680
What!
You?

566
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,520
Sudhamukhi?

567
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,760
Are you done?

568
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,120
Manmatha, you...

569
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,200
With me dressed like this...

570
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,640
It's not the first time
I'm seeing you like this, Sudha.

571
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,160
You're forgetting, Manmatha...

572
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,760
that I'm married
to someone else now.

573
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,080
You shouldn't have come
to meet me like this.

574
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,640
Sudhamukhi?

575
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,480
We wasted all our lives thinking
about what we should or shouldn't do.

576
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,160
Why are you ruining your life
like this?

577
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,360
Come with me.

578
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,520
You're not sticking to
what we had decided, Manmatha.

579
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,840
Sudhamukhi?

580
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,200
Sudhamukhi?
Where did you go?

581
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,040
Sudha!
Come with me, Sudha.

582
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,600
Don't kill yourself like this, Sudha.
Come with me.

583
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,680
-Sudhamukhi?
-No, Manmatha.

584
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,360
-That's not possible. You go.
-Sudhamukhi?

585
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,000
No, I won't.
You come with me.

586
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,200
-Come with me, Sudha.
-Go away, Manmatha!

587
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,600
Sudhamukhi?

588
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,240
Sudhamukhi?
Sudha--

589
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,640
What are you doing here?

590
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,920
My sari...

591
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,360
Don't know who kept it here.

592
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,160
Let's go.

593
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,600
This is the sketch
of Arunabha Chattopadhyay.

594
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,360
He is the main culprit
behind the murder...

595
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,280
of His Excellency,
Charles Robertson.

596
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,960
Whoever can catch him...

597
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,880
He will be promoted to the post
of head of this detective department.

598
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,440
And the government...

599
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,040
has announced a prize
of Rs. 1000 to catch him.

600
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,880
We want him dead or alive.

601
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,960
Do you love your country
like you used to, Manmatha?

602
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,240
It's simply what you think, Professor...

603
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,920
That if you love someone,
your love towards another decreases.

604
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,080
Is that so?

605
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,320
Then prove it.

606
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,560
That's the unfortunate part, Professor.

607
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,440
You have to prove your love
for your country...

608
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,760
by blowing your own trumpet.

609
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,480
Even Sita had to go through
the most severe test, Manmatha.

610
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,560
To prove her love
for her husband.

611
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,440
Killing the people
of your own country...

612
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,520
-What kind of freedom would that bring?
-Really?

613
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:24,360
Have you, the student of Gopal Krishna Gokhale
and Surendranath Banerjee...

614
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,680
taken the middle path?

615
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,720
Let me make it clear.
Your non-violent approach...

616
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,680
can never win us independence.
Never!

617
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,800
Enemies of the country
have to be killed!

618
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,560
I can't do it.

619
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,680
You...

620
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,560
Ask someone else to do it, Professor.

621
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,040
Bravo!

622
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,040
Bravo!

623
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,960
Where did it go, Manmatha...

624
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,960
the burning Vesuvius within your heart?

625
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,880
How could you forget...

626
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,680
your brother...

627
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,200
whom the British police tortured
to death in jail?

628
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,560
Did you simply forget?

629
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,920
Why do you always remind me
about the same thing?

630
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,920
No.

631
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,680
Looks like love
really does weaken a person.

632
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,200
-Love for your country is also love.
-Correct.

633
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,360
Love.

634
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,920
The greatest kind of love.

635
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,760
And for that, you need...

636
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,840
a tough heart.

637
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,400
And if you have to make some sacrifices
to prove your love...

638
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,800
...you do it.

639
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,960
Hmm?

640
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,920
Come.

641
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,800
Come with me.

642
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,160
The Goddess...

643
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,840
is a symbol
of undivided Bengal.

644
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,560
She embodies destruction
on the one hand...

645
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,440
and creation on the other.

646
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,280
Anyone who wants to
divide Bengal...

647
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,560
She will rip off their heads
and drink their blood.

648
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:32,000
So, light the fire
within your heart, Manmatha.

649
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,880
Sudhamukhi has left you
and married someone else.

650
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,520
Don't become weak
thinking about her.

651
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,360
And the responsibility
of slaying the demon...

652
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,360
the Goddess wants to bestow
upon you.

653
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:05,840
And that
you must do yourself.

654
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,160
Take it.

655
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,560
Hold it.

656
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,920
Go on.

657
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,560
Take it.

658
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,720
Hail to thee, Mother!

659
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,120
Hail to thee, Mother!

660
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,080
Hail to thee, Mother!

661
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,600
-Sir?
-Yes.

662
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,000
-Sign this file and send it upstairs soon.
-Okay.

663
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,160
Don't delay--

664
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,800
-Don't delay, okay?
-Okay.

665
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,160
What's going on, sir?

666
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,240
While the entire office is trying
to catch Arunabha Chattopadhyay...

667
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,160
you're just sitting here
and snacking away?

668
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,960
I'm not interested in arresting
any more freedom fighters.

669
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,360
That won't do, sir.

670
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,680
How will you get promoted
unless you arrest them?

671
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,240
You did a great job of arresting
some of them a few days ago.

672
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,880
For cases like that, you need
to run about more than rack your brains.

673
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:43,000
You keep waiting for days
and then they suddenly get caught.

674
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,480
And the motive?
Same old freedom for the country.

675
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,560
There's no...

676
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,480
There's nothing new about it.
I don't like all this.

677
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,200
I really don't get you.

678
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,440
What kind of a case do you want?

679
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,680
One that has
twist after twist.

680
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,320
Layer after layer.

681
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,480
Like?

682
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,880
-You want to know?
-Yes!

683
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,920
Let me give you an example.

684
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,360
Last night, Krishnamohan was murdered
on the terrace of his house.

685
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,200
There's a poisoned fish bone
in his left butt cheek.

686
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,600
That's why his wife, Khentimoni
is wailing.

687
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,160
When we reached...

688
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,560
the fish bone was still stuck
in his butt cheek.

689
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,760
This is the first time
I saw a fish bone like that, Watson.

690
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,400
Come back to me...

691
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,680
But.

692
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,320
But upon investigation,
it was found...

693
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,440
-That it wasn't Krishnamohan...
-Then?

694
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,880
but his wife, Khentimoni,
who was the target.

695
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,320
-Oh.
-Or...Or let's say...

696
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,640
Before Krishnamohan, six more--

697
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,080
No, not six, three.

698
00:53:55,120 --> 00:54:00,200
Three more people were killed similarly
with a fish bone in the buttocks!

699
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,680
Well sir, given how expensive
fish is...

700
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,280
wouldn't it be cheaper
to get him bitten by a snake?

701
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,240
But that would make it
convenient, easier.

702
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,360
Where are the twists and turns
in the plot?

703
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,960
The most significant
thing is...

704
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,120
The fact that a fish bone
is used as a weapon...

705
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,800
What do we understand
from that, Watson?

706
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,600
What do we understand?

707
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,680
We understand
that the murderer...

708
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,240
...sells fish.

709
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,440
KHEMANKARI FISH MARKET
DEEP WATER FISH SELLER

710
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,360
That's how we reach
murderer Khemankari's fish market.

711
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,160
A maze-like fish market.

712
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:52,000
It's pitch dark and various kinds of fish
are found all over the place.

713
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,640
We have to look through
all of them, Watson.

714
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,280
But we won't find the fish
we're looking for soon.

715
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,960
Then, suddenly...

716
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,640
We'll find a secret tunnel.

717
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,440
And right there...

718
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,200
At last...

719
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,160
in the fish's belly we found...

720
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,760
a ring with Khentimoni's name on it!

721
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,880
Khentimoni's ring was found...

722
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,320
inside the belly of a fish?

723
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,960
Just like King Dushyant had given a ring
to Shakuntala as a symbol of his love.

724
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,280
I've got it!
I've got it, sir.

725
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,000
Khemankari was secretly in love
with Krishnamohan.

726
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,840
But Krishnamohan was married
to Khentimoni.

727
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,640
That's why Khemankari takes revenge
by killing Krishnamohan...

728
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,480
so that she can steal the ring
he had given to his wife.

729
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,400
My foot!

730
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,040
Actually, it was
the other way round.

731
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,960
Khemankari was in love with...

732
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,000
-...Khentimoni.
-What!

733
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,680
"Shed not the band of love
I tied with your soul."

734
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,560
But it is illegal.

735
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:44,120
And Khentimoni's father forces her
to marry Krishnamohan.

736
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,080
To punish her for this injustice...

737
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,920
Khemankari brought a fish bone
from her own shop...

738
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,360
and committed the murder.

739
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,840
Khemankari stuck the fish bone
in Krishnamohan's buttocks?

740
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:18,520
Do you think about this gibberish
all day, sir?

741
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,600
Gibberish, huh?

742
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,800
Gibberish?

743
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,880
One day, this will be published
and readers will lap it up.

744
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,080
Published?
Rubbish!

745
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:31,320
Then why were three other people
killed with fish bones?

746
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,920
That's...that's important
to thicken the plot.

747
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,520
-Come on, let's go.
-Go where? Office time isn't over yet.

748
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,800
Have you ever seen a player
of the big leagues?

749
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,920
What, sir?

750
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,800
A player of the big leagues.

751
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,320
Come, I'll show you.

752
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,320
Sir!

753
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,600
Sir, wait!

754
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,640
Office time isn't over yet.

755
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,720
What a hassle!
Sir!

756
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,960
Sir!

757
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,680
MAKE TAGORE'S UNITY FESTIVAL
A SUCCESS

758
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,760
MAKE TAGORE'S UNITY FESTIVAL
A SUCCESS

759
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,360
OBSERVE NO COOKING DAY
ON OCTOBER 16

760
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,200
What's going on here, Watson?

761
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,400
-Haven't you heard, sir?
-No.

762
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:42,400
On October 16, the Partition of Bengal
is coming into effect.

763
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,920
That's why there's a strike
all over Kolkata.

764
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,640
Apparently, no food will be cooked
at anyone's house that day.

765
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,960
And to maintain unity
in the country, that day...

766
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,400
everyone will heed Tagore's call
to tie knot of unity on each other.

767
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,080
God knows how all this absurdity
will help.

768
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,160
Really!

769
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,480
Such energetic youth
in our society.

770
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:05,760
They should be sharpening their wit
by reading detective novels but no.

771
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,440
They just want
to free the country!

772
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,520
This is why our country is hopeless.
Just hopeless.

773
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,200
-Two teas, please.
-Celebrating unity like this.

774
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,080
Sudhamukhi?

775
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,440
There's a letter for you.

776
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,960
-Letter from who?
-I'm not educated enough to know.

777
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,720
Must be from my brother.

778
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,640
I've offered to give you lessons
so many times.

779
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,440
Times are changing.

780
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,560
Spare me, Sudhamukhi.

781
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:42,320
I've heard that educated
girls have a life of suffering.

782
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,040
And you know, Sudhamukhi...

783
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,880
Sudhamukhi?

784
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,800
What's wrong?

785
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,480
Nothing.

786
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:57,320
Check if the rice is cooked. Go!

787
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,520
Okay.

788
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,200
Sudhamukhi.

789
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,840
I came face-to-face
with your husband.

790
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,080
What a man he is!

791
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:17,120
I'm writing to warn you
about an imminent danger to him.

792
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,240
Danger?

793
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,520
If something happens to him...

794
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,880
I should not be held responsible.

795
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:30,600
Yours,
Manmathanath Majumdar.

796
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,480
He's here...

797
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,480
-That man?
-Yes, do you see him, Watson?

798
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,840
Yes.
Looks ordinary.

799
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,880
Two arms, two legs,
two eyes.

800
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,080
And a razor-sharp mind,
which others don't have.

801
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,280
Razor-sharp mind?
How?

802
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,240
-Then let me tell you.
-Yes.

803
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,720
-It happened a few days ago.
-Oh.

804
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,760
I'm sorry.

805
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,480
What happened, Bhupati?

806
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,720
Wait, sit down.

807
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,000
A perfectly healthy man
suddenly died of heart failure.

808
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,880
Okay.
So what?

809
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,480
Really? Can't you tell
that it's a very shrewd murder?

810
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,280
A shrewd murder?
What are you saying, sir?

811
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,720
I'm right, Watson.

812
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,960
I'm telling you,
the moment he bumped into Bhupati...

813
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,320
Bhupati's heart gave way
and he died.

814
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,280
Do you know
what actually happened?

815
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,440
Bhupati and that man
were crossing ways.

816
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,440
He bumped into Bhupati
on purpose.

817
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,320
In that brief moment,
he pulled a jujitsu punch on him!

818
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,040
And that killed Bhupati immediately.

819
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,600
Sir, please go home immediately.

820
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,480
Live a happy married life
with your wife.

821
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,480
You're completely losing
your mind.

822
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,240
Exceptional people have always
been called crazy. Nothing new about it.

823
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,080
It's a natural death,
he died of a heart attack.

824
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,400
And you say
it's a jujitsu punch!

825
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,840
-What rubbish are you saying?
-It's the truth!

826
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,760
Don't argue with me now.

827
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,360
I'm telling you, Watson.

828
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:30,320
This man will change
Bengal's dismal criminal world.

829
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,640
I must know why and how
he killed Bhupati.

830
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,200
-Hold this.
-Huh?

831
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,480
You stay here.

832
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,080
Hey, there.
How are you?

833
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:10,000
Uh... Sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

834
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,000
Did you see that, Watson?

835
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:19,120
He has the potential
to be a great criminal in future.

836
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,320
Why was he shocked to see you?

837
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,680
Good observation.

838
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,160
Criminals must have greater control
over their nerves.

839
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,200
He has to pursue this more seriously.

840
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,280
If criminals become too smart, sir...

841
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,960
-...detectives like us won't have a job.
-Yes.

842
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,120
-Why are you still waiting? Follow him!
-Yes, come on!

843
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,520
-Watson, who's the detective?
-You, sir.

844
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,360
-Then who will give the orders to follow?
-You.

845
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,360
Whatever! Why do you forget? Let's go!
-Yes, let's go.

846
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,640
KOLKATA
STUDENT LODGE

847
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,640
Let's go.

848
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,680
Excuse me.

849
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,600
Sir.

850
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,760
-What?
-Yes?

851
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:12,000
This man who just went in,
does he stay here?

852
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,400
-Who, Manmatha?
-Yes. What's his full name again?

853
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,560
Manmathanath Majumdar.

854
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,600
-Right, Manmathanath Majumdar.
-He stays here.

855
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,440
But why are you looking
for him?

856
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,200
Me?
I...

857
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,360
I am his friend.

858
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,680
-Friend?
-Hmm.

859
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,800
All his friends have gone home
for the vacations.

860
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,120
He's here alone.

861
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,160
But I've never seen you
here before.

862
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,840
Hmm?

863
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,360
How would you?
I'm his childhood friend.

864
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,840
Oh.

865
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,240
Goodbye.

866
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,240
Suddenly his childhood friend turns up now!

867
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,160
-Sir?
-Yes?

868
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,800
What are we going to do now?

869
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,000
I didn't pay attention to my studies
when I was younger, Watson.

870
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,280
I'm planning to start again.

871
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,480
Where are you going?

872
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,120
I have to leave town for a few days
on some important work.

873
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,800
You aren't going anywhere.
I won't let you go.

874
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,600
What a hassle!
I often have to go out for work.

875
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,160
This time you won't go.

876
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,680
Please listen to me.

877
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,560
Why are you behaving like this?

878
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,920
Why aren't you listening
to me?

879
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,520
-I'm scared.
-Scared?

880
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,960
Why?

881
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,400
For me?

882
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,720
Please! I repel Death!
Nothing will happen to me.

883
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,480
Don't worry, I'll...

884
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,440
I'll write to you.

885
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,280
What work is this?
That someone else can't do?

886
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,120
Someone else?
No one else is good enough for it.

887
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,520
I have to do it
and I must be successful too, Sudhamukhi.

888
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,400
Someone else!

889
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,280
Bye, Sudhamukhi.

890
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,600
You didn't listen to a word I said.

891
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,080
Goodbye.

892
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,720
Who is it?

893
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,480
May I come in?

894
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,840
Who are you?

895
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,600
Hello.
I'm Nishipadma Poddar.

896
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,280
My goodness!

897
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,920
-Nishipadma?
-Yes.

898
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,000
My mother used to say
my face looks just like a lotus.

899
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:23,160
-But the lotus is hidden in the mud.
-Yes, and I'm here to clean it.

900
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,480
What do you mean?

901
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,520
-You'll be staying here?
-Yes.

902
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,760
-This is a student lodge.
-I'm also a student.

903
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,640
-You're a student?
-Yes.

904
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,640
Don't even ask, Manmatha.
It's really sad.

905
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,920
I didn't pay attention to my studies
when I was young.

906
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:41,640
That's why, in this old age,
I'm prey to such embarrassment.

907
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,720
My son has brought home
a dog of a foreign breed.

908
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,520
And he understands
nothing but English.

909
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,760
That's why I took admission in college
so I don't lose face in front of the dog.

910
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,960
I'm in the room
next to yours.

911
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,040
So why are you here?

912
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,480
I just plonked myself here!

913
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,320
Please don't mind,
I'm a little clingy.

914
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,640
Where are you from, Manmatha?

915
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,560
Hooghly.
Why?

916
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,840
Hooghly?

917
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,400
Very nice.

918
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,760
You're related to Bhupati, aren't you?

919
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,800
Bhupati who?

920
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,360
You know, Bhupati Sen
from Kumortuli.

921
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,560
The man who died of heart attack
the other day in front of my house.

922
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,280
Bhupati...

923
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,240
Bhupati Sen?

924
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,800
I don't know any Bhupati Sen.

925
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,360
Oh.

926
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,920
Thought I saw you
in the neighbourhood that day.

927
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,280
You're mistaken.

928
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,440
Maybe your eyes are growing weak.

929
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,400
Quite possible.

930
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,120
Sir, your milk.

931
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,800
Give it here, son.

932
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,200
I take opium.

933
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,520
That's why I drink a lot of milk.

934
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,480
I love the cream of the milk.

935
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,800
I hope you drink milk
every day too?

936
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,360
You look like you work out.

937
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,680
Do you know jujitsu?

938
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,680
Why should I tell you?

939
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,000
Of course.

940
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,880
Alright.

941
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,800
We'll become friends gradually.

942
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,960
I'll come and bother you at times.
Please don't mind.

943
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,200
Goodbye.

944
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,200
-Nishipadma.
-Yes?

945
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,720
Did you lose something?

946
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:05,960
Me?

947
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,000
No.
Everything is intact.

948
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,960
What could I lose?
What do I even have to lose?

949
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:18,680
Bye.

950
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,120
Oh!

951
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,600
Thank you.

952
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,240
You know, Watson.

953
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:40,800
I think he has guessed
what's on my mind.

954
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,640
But I must say.

955
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:47,360
Manmatha is a worthy prey
for a hunter like me.

956
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,800
Jujitsu!

957
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,000
So you haven't been able
to make friends with him yet?

958
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,960
-How will I? I can't get close to him.
-Why?

959
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,920
-Actually, there's a problem, Watson.
-What?

960
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,600
I've lost my moustache.
I have the beard...

961
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,480
-...but can't find the moustache.
-What!

962
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,440
How will you be a detective
if you're so distracted?

963
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:12,120
I had to beg for the beard and moustache
from a theatre troupe.

964
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,880
-Hmmph!
-Watson, Watson, Watson.

965
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:17,040
Please get me another moustache.
I have the beard, just need the moustache.

966
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,640
Damn it!
That means you've made no progress at all?

967
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:23,560
Hey!
Mahimchandra is no amateur.

968
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,040
If Manmatha is cunning,
I'm no less.

969
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:33,920
I have already
searched his room.

970
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:49,640
Eh?

971
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,440
He has put down all his thoughts
in this notebook.

972
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,720
Well done, sir!

973
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,560
Really! You're so good
at your job.

974
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,120
With your perseverance,
you'll prove that he murdered Bhupati.

975
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,680
But how do you plan
to go about it?

976
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,200
Hmm?

977
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,120
What's your next move?

978
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:32,080
To know what's going on
in this genuis' mind, we need...

979
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,200
a woman.

980
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,680
A woman?

981
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:39,120
-Who?
-Harimati.

982
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:00,720
There she is!
Welcome, Harimati, welcome.

983
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,280
Come in, come in.

984
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,880
Watson, have you given her
all the instructions properly?

985
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,280
-Have you told her what to do?
-Yes, yes.

986
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,440
Harimati, he has told you
what do, right?

987
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,800
Look, sir.

988
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:17,520
I want the daily fees
at the beginning of each day.

989
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,760
I'm making that clear
right from the start.

990
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,080
Okay?

991
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,760
I'll work for you
till eight pm.

992
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:29,520
If you want me to work till later,
you have to pay me extra.

993
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,640
-Let me make that clear too.
-Oh gosh!

994
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,800
You fleece us here
at the detective agency.

995
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,240
-And at night, you fleece your clients!
-Watson.

996
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,040
-You still want more money, you whore?
-Watson!

997
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,720
Mind your tongue!

998
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,480
I'm earning off my beauty.

999
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,480
-What's your problem, huh?
-Harimati, Harimati, Harimati.

1000
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,600
-Don't get angry.
-If you're going to insult me...

1001
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,280
-I'm leaving.
-No, no, no!

1002
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,880
-Get lost!
-No, Harimati!

1003
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,880
Why are you getting angry?
Did I say I won't pay you?

1004
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,400
-We're about to begin something--
-To hell with your work!

1005
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,440
Oh.

1006
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,760
You have to first pay me
two days' advance.

1007
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:10,600
Only then will I leave
from your office.

1008
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,880
What's this?

1009
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,240
How will she
be of any help to you, sir?

1010
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,360
Watson!
Talk properly!

1011
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,440
-Talk to Harimati with respect.
-Huh?

1012
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,480
From now on, she's my...

1013
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:56,960
...lover.

1014
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,000
Hmmph!

1015
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,080
Are you serious?

1016
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,040
-You are...
-In love with her.

1017
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,880
You see, my heart feels restless
at this age.

1018
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,160
-Don't you have a wife?
-Oh, please!

1019
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,960
That hardly makes a difference.

1020
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,680
She has no charm.

1021
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:29,640
Moreover, we've been together
for so long that it has become stale.

1022
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:35,440
And I just can't do
without young, hot girls.

1023
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:41,680
Manmatha, do me a favour.
Harimati just won't return my love.

1024
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,120
-What's surprising about that?
-No, no, no.

1025
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:49,640
Manmatha, please do something.
I can't live without Harimati.

1026
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,960
What can I do?

1027
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,640
I have some work.
I've to leave.

1028
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,240
What work?
Jujitsu training?

1029
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,560
Again?

1030
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,880
Jujitsu again, huh?

1031
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,520
Why have you been obsessed
with jujitsu since that day?

1032
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,720
No, no. Let me tell you about it
in detail.

1033
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,920
Remember your relative--
My relative, Bhupati, who passed away?

1034
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:13,520
Later, I heard that he didn't die
of a heart attack.

1035
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:16,720
Someone used jujitsu
to murder him.

1036
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,720
What are you trying to say, huh?

1037
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,720
-That I murdered him?
-Oh, no.

1038
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:25,120
Not at all.
Why should you murder him?

1039
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,200
But you know what, Manmatha?

1040
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,120
There's a strange pleasure
in committing murder.

1041
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,760
It's not for everyone.

1042
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,520
Why not try it once, huh?

1043
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:40,960
Goodbye.

1044
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,240
What!
You discarded this one too?

1045
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,200
Uff!

1046
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,080
My brother has no sense.

1047
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,920
It's been so long.

1048
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,160
But he hasn't asked about his wife.

1049
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:25,760
And Sudhamukhi, why are you playing
if you don't feel like it?

1050
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,240
Sneha.

1051
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:35,640
Why is your brother so interested
in detective novels?

1052
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,240
Do you know?

1053
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,720
How would I know?

1054
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,800
And why are you asking this
all of a sudden?

1055
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:49,040
He isn't a detective himself, right?

1056
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,040
My brother?

1057
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,440
A detective?

1058
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,800
My brother, a detective?

1059
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,440
Oh, Sudhamukhi!

1060
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,840
-No, I can't do all that.
-Manmatha, Manmatha.

1061
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,840
Harimati goes to the park every day.
I've decided to propose to her there.

1062
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,760
-What a hassle!
-Please help me out.

1063
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,320
-Please help me.
-But how--

1064
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,200
-How can I help?
-Just be there with me.

1065
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,520
Be there with me.
Give me moral support, that's it.

1066
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,920
-I really need your help.
-What the hell are you doing?

1067
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,520
-Promise you'll help me, Manmatha?
-Okay--

1068
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,320
-Fine. Now let go of my hand.
-Thank you!

1069
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,840
-What are you...let go!
-Thank you!

1070
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,120
-What a hassle--
-Thank you.

1071
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,920
-Again! Let go!
-Thank you so much.

1072
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,560
It's okay.
Let go.

1073
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,120
Okay then, goodbye.

1074
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,480
Don't--

1075
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,080
Uff!

1076
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,480
(humming)

1077
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,040
Look, Manmatha.
There she is.

1078
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,080
Come, come with me.

1079
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,800
-Harimati?
-Hmm?

1080
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,840
Here he is.

1081
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,840
Remember I told you
about Manmatha?

1082
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,320
How handsome!

1083
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,000
Hmm.

1084
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,720
"O why must the moon
rise again tonight

1085
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,200
And fill with tears
these forlorn eyes?

1086
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:41,240
Why every night
should she fill the skies?"

1087
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,800
Go to him.
And take this.

1088
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:44,920
Go!

1089
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,320
Go close to him.

1090
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:54,040
"And though I know
he cannot be attained

1091
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:59,120
This fiery 'burning',
how can I quench?"

1092
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,520
Yearning, not burning.

1093
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,560
What?

1094
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,680
Hmm?

1095
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:09,040
"...This fiery yearning,
how can I quench?

1096
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,360
Why again?

1097
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:16,720
-Oh why tonight must the moon rise again?"
-"...must the moon rise again?"

1098
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,560
Who are you, handsome?

1099
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:26,240
At first sight,
I give my heart to you.

1100
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,720
Huh?
To me?

1101
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,800
-Give me a hug.
-Hey!

1102
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,600
What the hell are you doing?
Let go of me!

1103
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,800
What the hell is happening,
Nishipadma?

1104
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,160
What's...

1105
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,480
Rubbish!

1106
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,800
Hmmph!

1107
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,160
Go after him!

1108
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:48,520
You must get him to talk
about Bhupati's murder and jujitsu.

1109
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,040
-Don't wait, go--
-Money, first.

1110
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,840
What for?
I've already paid you.

1111
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,480
You made me mug up a poem.
You think that's for free?

1112
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,560
I need extra money for that.

1113
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,360
All you care about is money!

1114
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,160
Damn it!
He has gone so far.

1115
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,800
Here.
Take it.

1116
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,440
Go, go, go!

1117
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,280
(humming)

1118
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,320
Hurry up!

1119
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:18,840
Uff!

1120
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,920
I don't believe it.

1121
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:26,040
Whatever he might be,
I'll never believe he's a cheat.

1122
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:31,120
How long will you go on
with false consolation, Sudha?

1123
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,880
You want proof?

1124
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,400
Very well.

1125
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,680
I will prove it to you.

1126
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,040
And I'll also show you
what his job really is.

1127
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:46,080
-No, he can't cheat me--
-He is!

1128
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,880
He has been cheating you
since day one.

1129
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,600
By hiding his real identity.

1130
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,800
You just refuse to understand.

1131
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,480
I'll send you a letter
about when I can give you proof.

1132
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,400
Come see it
if you have the guts.

1133
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,880
It repels me to even kill
a person like him.

1134
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,960
Who was that man?

1135
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:38,280
Harimati failed to get
any information too, then?

1136
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,280
Damn it!

1137
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:45,040
He isn't letting Harimati
anywhere near him.

1138
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,680
Such a difficult man he is!

1139
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:54,320
-Didn't you find anything in the notebook?
-No, Watson.

1140
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,720
It's full of rubbish.

1141
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:00,720
That sneaky man hasn't written anything
about jujitsu and Bhupati.

1142
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:05,480
So none of your assumptions
turned out to be true?

1143
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,840
Who's the detective?

1144
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,840
You, sir.

1145
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,040
Who will decide
what's right or wrong?

1146
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,160
You.

1147
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,760
That bastard is the murderer!

1148
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,680
God cannot be so unjust to me.

1149
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,520
-No, I must find clues. Watson?
-Yes?

1150
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,920
-I will find clues.
-Where are you going?

1151
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,400
Gone case...

1152
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:34,000
(indistinct chatter)

1153
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,400
Uff!

1154
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,520
I'll look into it.

1155
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,320
What's wrong with Mahim, Hutashon?

1156
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,840
He isn't spending much time
at office.

1157
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:49,000
Has he heard
that the commissioner is angry with him?

1158
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:52,680
Even if his ears have heard it,
his head hasn't registered it.

1159
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,640
There's a short circuit
in his brain.

1160
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:58,720
And his head might just explode
if the wires aren't fixed soon.

1161
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,520
He still can't stop running
after that man, huh?

1162
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,880
No. Why don't you all
try to make him understand?

1163
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,760
What is he looking for
in this notebook?

1164
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,960
Jujitsu moves!

1165
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,520
This is that man's notebook.

1166
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,640
He has completely lost it.

1167
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:30,320
"Sincerely,
your Professor...

1168
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,680
Arunabho Chattopadhyay."

1169
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,160
Hutashon.

1170
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,160
-Hutashon!
-Coming, sir.

1171
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,400
Yes, sir?

1172
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:53,080
What's more dear to you, Hutashon?

1173
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:54,640
Mahim?

1174
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,640
Or your job?

1175
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,560
What's the matter?

1176
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,640
I want an answer.

1177
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,640
Why, just why?

1178
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,880
Why is it taking you so much time
to do this simple task?

1179
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:20,960
At the hostel...

1180
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,040
With so many people around...

1181
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,520
it's not possible.

1182
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,400
I know that the students
are away on vacation.

1183
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:32,400
Actually, you can't.
You won't be able to do it.

1184
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,280
A government detective...

1185
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,040
is so close at hand,
right under your nose.

1186
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:43,240
And your hands tremble
to shoot him?

1187
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,400
Really?

1188
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:50,840
It disgusts me to call you a student
of Arunabha Chattopadhyay.

1189
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:53,000
That's right.

1190
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,800
You didn't have to come here, Professor.

1191
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,840
I was compelled to come.

1192
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,320
I don't want to listen
to anything else, Manmatha.

1193
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,200
I want the news
of detective Mahimchandra shot dead.

1194
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,000
And from you.

1195
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,400
Keep that in mind.

1196
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:16,120
Do whatever it takes
to prepare your mind for it.

1197
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:29,040
Manmatha wants to kill me.

1198
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:32,920
Bravo, you true blue Bengali!

1199
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:36,520
Hail to thee, Mother!

1200
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,040
-Hail to thee, Mother!
-Hail to thee, Mother!

1201
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,680
Hail to thee, Mother!

1202
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,280
-Hail to thee, Mother!
-Hail to thee, Mother!

1203
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:42,800
Hail to thee, Mother!

1204
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,200
-Hail to thee, Mother!
-Hail to thee, Mother!

1205
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:45,520
I can't do it!

1206
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,040
I can't do it.

1207
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:48,360
I just can't.

1208
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,560
Professor...

1209
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,360
Give me any other task
and I'll do it but...

1210
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,200
But I can't kill anyone.

1211
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,720
-What's the problem?
-Morality.

1212
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,920
The problem lies
in morality, Professor.

1213
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,960
Morality.

1214
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:07,440
Morality is a childish notion.

1215
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:11,800
Whatever you do
to fulfill your goal is morally right.

1216
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,280
And if you talk about morality...

1217
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:21,800
Was making Sudhamukhi suspicious
of her husband's character...

1218
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,720
...morally right in any way?

1219
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:28,120
You know very well, Manmatha.

1220
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,640
It is only
to get closer to you...

1221
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:36,760
that Mahimchandra is using Harimati
as a bait.

1222
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:41,040
He is not at all attracted
to Harimati.

1223
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,160
Using him as a bait...

1224
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,520
Or poisoning Sudhamukhi's mind
to break up her family...

1225
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,880
Where's the morality here?

1226
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:13,800
Even morality has to be moulded
to suit circumstances, Manmatha.

1227
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,520
Does Sudhamukhi believed it?

1228
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,080
Not yet.

1229
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:28,440
She will.

1230
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:36,520
Once the seeds of suspicion are sown
in a woman's mind...

1231
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,240
it's only a matter of time
before the cracks start to appear.

1232
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:45,280
No.

1233
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:51,800
In order to awaken
dormant volcanoes like you...

1234
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:57,800
Sudhamukhi should be asked
to join the group back.

1235
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:04,360
Why this sudden change of heart?

1236
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,840
The fire of her youth...

1237
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,800
used to weaken our group.

1238
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:17,440
This blow will subdue
the fire.

1239
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,000
And it will be replaced...

1240
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,600
by a fire of vengeance.

1241
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:33,800
What exactly are you
trying to say, Professor?

1242
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,040
Hmm.

1243
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,560
I'm thinking about something else.

1244
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,640
If Sudhamukhi...

1245
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,760
leaves her family...

1246
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,080
breaks her marriage...

1247
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:56,080
and joins our group...

1248
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,800
I'll get the old Manmatha back, right?

1249
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:07,920
Is this even possible...
Professor?

1250
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,240
It's possible.

1251
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:14,000
Everything is possible
for the country.

1252
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:20,720
Listen carefully to what I say.

1253
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,360
Manmatha?

1254
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:30,440
-Oh, Nishipadma. Tell me.
-I need a word with you.

1255
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:35,400
After a lot of trouble, I managed
to shift Harimati's interest from you to me.

1256
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:40,440
We were planning to go
for a picnic this Saturday.

1257
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,560
-Great!
-Please come along with us.

1258
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:43,880
-Me?
-Yes.

1259
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,080
-Very well.
-Great!

1260
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,240
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1261
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:56,520
I was thinking
if I take my lover along too.

1262
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,040
Oh, wonderful!

1263
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,040
Why should one journey
have different goals?

1264
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,800
Let us both meet
there with our beloveds.

1265
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,160
Then let's see what happens.

1266
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:09,080
-Then it's decided.
-Absolutely.

1267
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:14,200
I offered the bait myself, Watson.

1268
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:16,440
Can you imagine?

1269
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:17,680
Can you imagine...

1270
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,360
that a talented criminal
like Manmatha

1271
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,760
and a freedom fighter like
Arunabha Chattopadhyay...

1272
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,920
are planning to murder me.

1273
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:27,400
They're planning to murder
detective Mahimchandra.

1274
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,640
I'm...

1275
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,000
I'm feeling so proud right now.

1276
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:32,160
Sir, please let the commissioner know.

1277
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:34,560
-Don't risk your life like this.
-Don't you dare tell him.

1278
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:36,160
Don't say a word
to anyone.

1279
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,560
Watson, I won't get an opportunity
like this again.

1280
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:44,040
A duel between a skilled criminal
and a detective by the Ganges.

1281
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,680
This Saturday.

1282
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:47,360
Please be there, Watson.

1283
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:51,040
I don't like unraveling mysteries
without you.

1284
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,640
You'll be there, won't you?
Be there, my friend.

1285
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,640
Don't say a word
to anyone.

1286
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:02,360
Where are you going?

1287
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,040
-Sir?
-"Be patient in faith."

1288
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:07,560
-Sir?
-"Be courageous in action."

1289
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,600
-Where are you going, sir?
-"Hold you head high."

1290
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,240
-Have you lost your mind?
-"Have no fear."

1291
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,520
Sudhamukhi.

1292
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:11,600
Letter for you.

1293
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,880
That man dropped it
in the letter box this afternoon.

1294
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:26,280
I'm not educated.

1295
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:29,840
But the contents of the letter...

1296
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,240
is quite clear to me.

1297
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,360
I heard everything, Sudhamukhi.

1298
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:42,400
What did you get
by stifling your feelings like this?

1299
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,280
You know...

1300
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,440
Before my marriage...

1301
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:51,080
I was in love
with someone too.

1302
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:56,760
But my father forced me
to marry someone else.

1303
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,440
And this is my condition now.

1304
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:04,600
Sudhamukhi, I couldn't do it.

1305
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:06,480
But you can do it.

1306
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,960
Go, Sudhamukhi.
Go!

1307
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,800
-What are you saying, Sneha?
-I'm saying what's right.

1308
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,040
Don't stifle your feelings
like this.

1309
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,640
It's a sin to stifle your feelings!

1310
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:19,880
Go, Sudhamukhi.
You should go.

1311
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:42,960
Please go away, Sneha.

1312
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,640
Leave me alone.

1313
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:45,160
Come, get off.

1314
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,480
Come.

1315
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,960
There you go!

1316
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:56,240
I need double payment today.

1317
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:59,240
-Let me make that clear.
-Why are you always after money?

1318
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,640
Have you done what I asked you to?

1319
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,120
I'm trying my best.

1320
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:07,000
Look, if you don't like it,
tell me.

1321
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:11,280
-I refuse to work and be insulted too.
-Hey, wait!

1322
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:14,800
Why do you get angry?
Look. Manmatha is here.

1323
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:17,160
Manmatha has reached.
You come this side.

1324
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:19,560
Look who's here.

1325
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,840
It's Manmatha!

1326
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:27,880
There you are, Manmatha.
Where were you?

1327
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:30,800
We've been waiting
for so long.

1328
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,920
-So, where's your beloved?
-Oh gosh!

1329
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,640
Why are you so concerned
about his beloved?

1330
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:39,360
I'm simply a worshipper
of beauty.

1331
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,080
If I must die, might as well be
at the hands of a beautiful woman.

1332
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,840
What say, Manmatha?

1333
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,360
(carriage pullers humming)

1334
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:11,920
Shall I ask her to get off?

1335
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:14,360
Of course, why delay?
Please do it.

1336
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,400
Come out.

1337
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,920
Why are you feeling shy?
We are all worshippers of beauty.

1338
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:59,000
Remove the veil
and show us your face.

1339
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,280
Hmm?

1340
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:13,440
Huh?

1341
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,560
Hey!
Give that back.

1342
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:29,200
Your character and makeup
are equally ridiculous.

1343
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:30,800
Give that back to me.

1344
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,640
Don't--
Don't tear these off.

1345
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:34,040
-Oh no!
-I have to return them.

1346
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:38,440
Sudhamukhi, this is my disguise
so I can catch Manmatha red-handed.

1347
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:41,400
And Harimati works at my office,
I have no...

1348
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,800
I have nothing going on with her.

1349
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,920
Come on, tell her.

1350
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,960
I'm not in this anymore.
I'm leaving.

1351
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,760
Where are you going?
Wait!

1352
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,520
-But you took so much money.
-I'll return it to you in office.

1353
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:58,400
-Trust me, this isn't true, Sudhamukhi.
-But Manmatha is my real lover.

1354
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:04,720
From before my marriage.

1355
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:08,480
He couldn't forget me
even after I got married.

1356
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:11,880
And I?

1357
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:17,320
I can tolerate my husband's neglect,
I can tolerate his lies...

1358
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,080
But adultery?

1359
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:23,000
Wait, you can't say it all.
I'm the detective, let me say it.

1360
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,560
So let me start.

1361
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:26,200
Tell me, Sudhamukhi.

1362
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,480
Manmatha used to hover around our house
to see you, isn't it?

1363
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:35,040
Mahim.

1364
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,400
You are lucky
that you've got a wife like her.

1365
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,080
Yes.

1366
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,920
Yes.
It's true that...

1367
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:45,560
I tried to contact Sudhamukhi
after her marriage.

1368
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,360
Come with me, Sudhamukhi.

1369
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,480
I'll deal with whatever happens.

1370
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,200
That's not possible, Manmatha.

1371
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,920
My husband has committed no crime.

1372
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,040
I can't deceive him.

1373
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,680
Then you won't listen
to anything I say?

1374
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,520
Why are you worried
about what people will say, Sudha?

1375
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:24,040
Why do you tell me
the same thing, Manmatha?

1376
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:36,480
Then promise me something.

1377
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:43,360
I will stand in front of your house
every evening.

1378
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,240
Light a lantern and...

1379
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:48,520
come to your
south-facing balcony once.

1380
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:52,040
I want to see you
once every day, Sudhamukhi.

1381
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,640
Don't deny me this
little bit of joy.

1382
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:02,920
Brilliant!

1383
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:07,320
From what I understand,
this is a very complex case.

1384
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:10,600
Exactly the kind
I've always wanted.

1385
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:13,680
Superb!

1386
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,000
Very nice.

1387
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:20,320
Bravo, Manmatha!
Bravo!

1388
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,640
You really are talented.

1389
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:26,880
You set up a crime scene
at a detective's house.

1390
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:30,920
Extremely complex case.

1391
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:38,000
And I was worried
about jujitsu and Bhupati.

1392
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:40,120
Brilliant!

1393
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:45,040
An exceedingly complex case.

1394
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:48,840
Sudhamukhi...

1395
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,240
You're right.

1396
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,880
I'm not worthy of you.

1397
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:56,600
You should go with Manmatha.

1398
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:02,280
Yes, she will.

1399
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:04,760
She will.

1400
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,280
Who is this?

1401
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:13,200
I won't let Sudha waste all her life
with a sexless person like you.

1402
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,520
But before she leaves...

1403
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:20,440
she will kill the enemy
of the country herself.

1404
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:26,760
Arunabha Chattopadhyay!

1405
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:29,440
-Gopal?
-Don't you dare try to run away.

1406
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:31,680
Police?
How did the police get here?

1407
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:33,040
You are under arrest.

1408
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:36,800
-Mahim, did you inform the police?
-Me? No, I mean...

1409
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,320
I can't really understand
what's going on.

1410
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:42,680
I didn't call the police--
Wait, wait. I'll look into it.

1411
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,240
Gopal?

1412
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:46,640
Watson?

1413
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:48,920
What are you doing here?

1414
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:52,160
-What's the matter?
-Mahim, it's the commissioner's order.

1415
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:54,080
Arrest each of them.

1416
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:55,560
Arrest?

1417
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:59,920
How strange, Gopal.
I'm busy with a personal case here.

1418
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:05,160
I'm trying to solve a very complex case
and you're jumping in the middle of it!

1419
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,200
Rubbish!

1420
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,600
Watson.
Take Gopal away.

1421
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,240
Go away!

1422
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,880
-Hail to thee, Mother!
-What the hell are you doing?

1423
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:16,520
Sudha!

1424
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:23,400
Hutashon!
We have to catch them.

1425
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:29,400
We must come back
with the force.

1426
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:33,800
Mr. Detective.

1427
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,640
Get up.

1428
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,040
I know.

1429
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,600
I know that this is all
a part of your plan.

1430
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,840
But no matter how much you plan...

1431
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:45,840
It's not so simple to catch
Arunabha Chattopadhyay.

1432
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,080
-Me?
-Shame on you!

1433
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:51,400
You've been hiding this
from me all this while?

1434
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:54,760
The thing that I hate
most in life...

1435
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,960
You do that for a living?

1436
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,880
You're a police detective?

1437
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:04,920
You conspire against and arrest
freedom fighters like this?

1438
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,880
Ridiculous!
All of you are blaming me...

1439
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,480
I am a detective.

1440
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,200
I only know criminals.

1441
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:13,200
I don't care
who's a freedom fighter and who isn't.

1442
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:15,360
I do my work with integrity.

1443
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:16,640
I have not deceived anyone.

1444
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:18,760
-Don't you have any sense of morality?
-No, I don't.

1445
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,920
-Have you no duty towards your country?
-No, I don't.

1446
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:22,920
I have no sense of morality,
nor any duty!

1447
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:25,240
My only duty is
towards my detective work.

1448
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:29,240
I am a detective
and that's my sole identity.

1449
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,080
Huh?
What's this?

1450
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:46,600
Hutashon?

1451
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:54,200
Sudhamukhi.

1452
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:07,320
Take it.

1453
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:12,640
Finish the enemy
of your country, Sudha.

1454
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,800
How can you say that, Professor?

1455
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,880
Do what I tell you.

1456
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,120
What's the matter?
Take it.

1457
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:28,040
Drop the gun, Hutashon.

1458
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:30,680
You're making a mistake.

1459
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:34,640
You'll kill your senior officer?

1460
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:37,280
I will not kill you, Gopal.

1461
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:40,480
You'll be shot dead
by Arunabha Chattopadhyay.

1462
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:44,240
That's what everyone will know.

1463
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:47,600
Prepare your mind.

1464
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,200
Take it.

1465
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,360
Sudha...

1466
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:03,720
-Professor, what are you doing?
-Step aside, Manmatha.

1467
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,840
Shoot him, Sudhamukhi.

1468
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:08,680
Sudha!
Listen to me, Sudha.

1469
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,160
Don't make this mistake.

1470
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,480
You can never achieve anything
by killing someone.

1471
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:14,640
Sudha.

1472
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:20,280
-Professor? Professor!
-Shoot him, Sudhamukhi.

1473
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:22,640
-Professor.
-Keep quiet, Manmatha.

1474
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:25,040
-Shoot him!
-No, Sudha, don't.

1475
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:28,880
So many innocent, non-violent
young people...

1476
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:32,280
have been framed by you and handed over
to the police as terrorists, Gopal.

1477
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,080
You have murdered
so many of them in jail.

1478
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:40,440
Only for your personal grudge.

1479
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:43,240
And then you spread rumours
among the rebels...

1480
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,440
That Mahim was the one at fault?

1481
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:49,520
Shame on you, Gopal!
You call yourself human?

1482
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:52,840
Why are you thinking so much?
Shoot him, Sudhamukhi.

1483
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,960
Sudha! Sudha!
Sudha!

1484
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Don't do this, Sudha.
Give the gun to me.

1485
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,400
This is like
a live detective novel, Sudhamukhi.

1486
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:05,040
If this is a dream,
please don't wake me up.

1487
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,920
Go on, shoot me.

1488
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,080
-Shoot him, Sudhamukhi!
-Yes, go on.

1489
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:13,120
-Professor! Don't let her shoot him.
-Shoot me.

1490
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:15,080
Give me the gun.
I'll shoot him.

1491
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:17,200
-Shoot him, Sudhamukhi.
-Sudha, don't do it.

1492
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:19,680
-Don't shoot him, Sudha.
-Shoot him!

1493
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:22,440
Wait, Hutashon.

1494
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:26,120
You're forgetting
what our job is all about.

1495
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:28,840
We are spies, Gopal.

1496
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:31,440
It's our job to betray.

1497
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:36,040
But even spies have mutual trust
in each other.

1498
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:38,560
You have broken that trust.

1499
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:41,480
A person like you
has no right to live.

1500
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,240
No!

1501
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,800
Forgive me, Hutashon.

1502
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:54,120
-Shoot him, Sudhamukhi!
-Let go!

1503
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:55,320
Shoot me.

1504
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:58,960
-Professor! You are forcing her.
-Shut up!

1505
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:01,560
Sudhamukhi.

1506
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:04,720
Think about all those
who have been martyred...

1507
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:06,720
They, whom you called
your brothers.

1508
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:09,960
This man is responsible
for each hanging.

1509
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,720
You can't have
any weakness for him.

1510
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:15,080
You'll have his blood on you
all your life, Sudha.

1511
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:17,480
"Never be motivated
by the results of your actions.

1512
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:19,640
Nor be attached
to not performing your duties".

1513
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:22,160
-Do your duty. Shoot me.
-No...

1514
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:25,400
What's wrong?
You're not holding the gun right. Let me...

1515
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:27,200
What's the problem?
Should I show you how?

1516
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:29,320
Sudha!

1517
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:39,520
Hail to thee, Mother!

1518
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,560
Hail to thee, Mother!

1519
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:47,480
Hail to thee, Mother!

1520
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:51,120
-Hail to thee, Mother!
-Sudha...

1521
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:53,080
I killed him.

1522
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:54,800
-Hail to thee, Mother!
-Sudha.

1523
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,000
Manmatha, I killed him.

1524
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:57,480
-Sudha.
-Hail to thee, Mother!

1525
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,560
I killed him, Manmatha.

1526
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:01,600
Sudha.
We have to get away from here.

1527
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:04,000
We can't stay here.
The police is here, let's go.

1528
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,240
Come Sudha, get up.
Stand up.

1529
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:08,520
Get up.
Let's go.

1530
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:10,920
-I killed him...
-Let's leave, Sudha.

1531
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:13,760
How did I kill him, Manmatha?

1532
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:18,880
Sir?

1533
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:23,200
What happened to you?
What a disaster!

1534
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:24,680
Sir?

1535
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,000
Sir?

1536
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:27,480
Sir?

1537
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,400
Oh God.
Must get him to the hospital.

1538
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:33,120
Is anyone there?
He has to be take to the hos--

1539
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:34,400
Huh?

1540
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,560
Sir, you're alive?

1541
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,720
-Who's the detective, Watson?
-You, sir.

1542
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:41,840
Then?

1543
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:43,520
Look at this.

1544
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,920
I had made this with great hopes.

1545
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:52,720
Finally, it came to good use.

1546
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:55,560
-Did you always wear it when you went out?
-No!

1547
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:57,320
Why would I wear it
all the time?

1548
01:50:57,320 --> 01:51:00,480
-Manmatha wanted to kill me, remember?
-Hmm.

1549
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,200
I always wanted this, you know.

1550
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:06,360
A criminal would shoot at me
and I'd survive because of this vest.

1551
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,840
-Exactly like in detective novels.
-Yes.

1552
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:12,800
Finally, my dream was fulfilled
by my wife.

1553
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:16,440
Oh, it's a day
of great joy, Watson!

1554
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:19,480
-But that man escaped with your wife, sir.
-Huh?

1555
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,200
-Let them go.
-What?

1556
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:27,080
For once at least, I did the right thing,
in my wife's opinion.

1557
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,040
Say what you will but...

1558
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:31,840
Constantly investigating
the twisted minds of criminals...

1559
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,760
has made me
quite a skilled criminal too.

1560
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:36,400
Isn't it, Watson?

1561
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,800
Didn't you love your wife, sir?

1562
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,760
-Sir?
-Hmm?

1563
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:27,680
It's for the best, Watson.

1564
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:30,960
She'll be happy and...

1565
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,120
I will be fine too.

1566
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:39,280
The more I see you,
the more I am amazed.

1567
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:41,200
Isn't it?
I am amazed too!

1568
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:42,480
Oh, wait.

1569
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,600
Hold this.

1570
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,280
There you go.

1571
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:53,480
-Return these.
-Yes, sir.

1572
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:55,040
-Let's go.
-Where?

1573
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:57,960
Don't we have a new case
to solve?

1574
01:52:58,520 --> 01:52:59,640
Let's go!

1575
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:04,160
-But really, Watson.
-Yes?

1576
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:08,200
-There's no fear if I have this on me.
-It's brilliant!

1577
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,800
-Do you want one?
-I wouldn't mind it, sir.

1578
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,520
-Hey! Wait.
-What now?

1579
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:15,480
Careful.

1580
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:17,720
Is anyone there, sir?

1581
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:18,920
-Softly.
-No, no one there.

1582
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:21,920
-All clear. Come on.
-Phew! Let's go.
