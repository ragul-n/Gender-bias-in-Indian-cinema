1
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,021
This is a fictitious story

2
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,352
All the situations in this film
would definitely resemble someone

3
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:38,520
<i>King Vikram and the ghost</i>

4
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:01,283
Master super
What an attire?

5
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:02,879
What a style!

6
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:07,222
Your acting in Mayura,
Krishnadevaraya and Babruvahana is super

7
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,719
Super dialogues

8
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:14,229
Master, When I tried to buy a ticket
for your film 'Thayigae thakka maga'...

9
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:17,459
...people killed me in the stampede

10
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,229
Since then, unable to find a place...

11
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,806
...l am wandering like a ghost

12
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,740
- What are you saying?
Do you know who am I?

13
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,237
- I am Vikrama, Trivikrama
-So you are not our 'Annavru'

14
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,815
After seeing your dress and outfit...

15
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,920
I thought our 'Annavru'
has come for shooting

16
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:40,252
Ok, Why are you roaming
like a ghost in this grave yard?

17
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,586
I have a great quest

18
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,264
To fulfill that I am
collecting dead bodies

19
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,262
Unable to watch the 'Annavru's' movie...

20
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,265
...l became a ghost and wandering here

21
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:55,099
- If you die, you will become a
big monster -Shut your mouth

22
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,271
Those who are unable
to fulfill their own desires...

23
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,779
...a coward like you
will suffer this tragic fate..

24
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,282
...and not brave guys like me

25
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,284
Brave and gutsy guys are
all gone in the previous era

26
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,118
It seems you have not
yet seen our world properly

27
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,281
Look at the real world

28
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,629
Oh gosh! What a noise pollution there!

29
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,640
It's not noise pollution Master
it is soul pollution, look there

30
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,640
My wife is not good
I have to kill her today

31
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,647
Nobody is giving alms,
let everyone die

32
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,652
I have to acquire the property
by deceiving my brother

33
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,323
Nobody is available
for the pick pocket

34
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,981
Only if my husband is perfect
I needn't suffer like this

35
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,657
Did you see that?

36
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,165
This is not noise
pollution but soul pollution

37
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,330
Did you see how humans
are conspiring within?

38
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:03,841
It is natural

39
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,834
Can the animals think
if not the humans?

40
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,670
That's why it is told...

41
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,340
Animals are better than human beings

42
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:14,683
Look there

43
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:19,687
Master, I swear on my mom I will help
even by selling my wife's sacred thread

44
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:26,188
You loafer, I know about you
I will make you beg in the road

45
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,692
Listen I swear on my mom
I won't get a friend like you

46
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:37,531
He is plotting against me. Let my job
get over, I will deal with him later

47
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,870
Have it

48
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:42,710
Mother in law

49
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,211
I don't feel that you're my
mother in law but a goddess

50
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,884
You too, you are like my daughter

51
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:56,390
See how she is acting, thinks I am
insane, Let my work get done

52
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,058
Yes mother in law

53
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:02,563
I am fortunate to
have a mother in law like you

54
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:07,736
You old owl, let me get
the key first, then I'll show you

55
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:11,741
Oh what is this, it is full of deceit

56
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:15,403
Yes Master, 90 out of 100
people are bad in that world

57
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,414
Women sleep with their husbands
fantasising Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan

58
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,075
Husbands sleep with their
wives fantasising Kajol and Manisha

59
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,744
Girls fall in love after
seeing how wealthy their lovers are

60
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,084
These people have
at least 50 to 100 masks

61
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,751
The love mask, the hate mask
The religion mask, the caste mask

62
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,423
People wear masks
like these and dupe each other

63
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,932
This is the psychological war
The psychological war

64
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:41,096
Living with true conscience has
become impossible for them

65
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,434
Without wearing the different
designs of masks..

66
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:48,637
One of my childhood friends vowed to
live with his true conscience in that city

67
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:54,115
I will tell you his strange
psychological story, listen to it

68
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,292
You have mistaken him
He is a good person

69
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,294
He loves you very much

70
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,330
Don't leave him, don't

71
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,675
Don't lose the patience, search him
Definitely he can be found, search him

72
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,162
Definitely he can be found
Go, be courageous

73
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,343
Rathi what is this?

74
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,145
You are coming now
college has started one hour earlier

75
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,322
What is going on there?
Why everyone is running?

76
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,326
Somebody has been caught
by the police on rape charges

77
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,321
It's him
It should be him

78
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,193
Who is at this time?

79
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,236
Not letting peacefully
to sleep after boozing

80
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,540
Brother, look there

81
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,396
This girl looks super,
shall I send her to room?

82
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,894
Stand quietly

83
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:39,733
Who are you?

84
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:52,738
My name is Rathi.
Take all these, you should help me

85
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:57,412
- What is that? -I mean
I am loving someone

86
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,088
He is not seen anywhere
I searched for him everywhere

87
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,090
I don't have strength
to live without him

88
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,760
Please trace him
and tie him in our house

89
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,425
He shouldn't go anywhere leaving me

90
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,592
Shouldn't go anywhere

91
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,770
- Help me, help me
-Get up

92
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,442
Where are you staying?

93
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,779
Kaveri nagar, 2nd main road

94
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,281
Crazy girl!

95
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,046
Take this and go home

96
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,118
I will come to your
area tomorrow and inquire

97
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,780
Girls shouldn't venture
outside during the night like this

98
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,789
- Dear chan -Yes brother
-Take her to home safely- Ok

99
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,993
You go I'll come
tomorrow, inquire and make it right

100
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,462
- You go
-Come

101
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,207
Greetings Master!

102
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,712
Where is the Rathi's house in this area?
-Look it's there

103
00:13:58,638 --> 00:13:59,981
Who is that man loving her?

104
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,486
- You mean the one who is in
love with her -It's me (Naanu)

105
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,648
Yes it's me (Naanu)
who loves here

106
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,554
You scoundrel
Dirty fellow, you ironing man

107
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,384
- Do you love her?
You scoundrel, Difly fellow

108
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:16,899
- Hit him
-Leave

109
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,893
Leave him poor fellow
Leave me

110
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,969
Why are you beating
him, he is bleeding?

111
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,070
You indecent fellow
You have got so beautiful girl

112
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,834
Instead of being happy
with it, he is troubling her

113
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,180
It's not him who loved her
It's Naanu, Naanu(Me)

114
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,410
ls it you?

115
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:36,509
Hit him, kick him

116
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:43,459
Leave it, why you get so tense?
They are not loving that girl

117
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,428
The man's name who
loves this girl is Naanu

118
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,362
- What? ls his name
Naanu (me)? -Yes Master!

119
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,331
- His name itself is Naanu
-Can anyone keep a name like that?

120
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,362
No one has kept it
He kept it for himself

121
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,100
Where is he now?
Go away,Go out

122
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,112
Come sir
I'll tell you about him in detail

123
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,612
Come I will tell you A to Z about him

124
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,379
Sit down, sit down

125
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,915
To be frank, that Rathi
almost got adjusted to me

126
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,921
But that guy had
won her head suddenly

127
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,060
Let it be, there is no
dearth for girls in the country

128
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,627
He is a dirty fellow

129
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,469
- Child why are you sharpening
the knife? -Look there

130
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,568
I asked that merchant to
give me fruit as I am hungry...

131
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:35,406
...but he asked money, So I will attack
him with this knife and bring the fruits

132
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:39,312
Oh it's a sin
No child no

133
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,511
That is a great sin
Don't do like that

134
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,519
Humans will go to the hell
if they commit like that

135
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,714
ls it? Do they go to hell?

136
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,592
Look there, that ant killed
that one and taking away to eat

137
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,098
ls it sin? Will it go to hell?

138
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,068
It's not like that child

139
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,273
Those are animals
we are human beings

140
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:06,537
God has given us sense to discriminate
between wrong and right

141
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,112
We should not cheat or lie

142
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,109
Mother

143
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,943
Yesterday father along with the Rangi
was playing kabadi in the cattle yard

144
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,614
Will you tell
Will you tell? - Father

145
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,286
Your teaching is boring...

146
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,793
...l feel asleep that's why I came later

147
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,299
Will you tell? - Oh gosh!

148
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,361
Ranganna only yesterday
you were saying to Rajanna..

149
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:34,368
...that let this scoundrel come
you would chop him

150
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,132
Now he has come, hit him

151
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,833
Hit him - Oh gosh!

152
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,809
Come doctor

153
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:48,312
ls it him that you were scolding that he
robbed 50 rupees by giving fake drug?

154
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,319
You stupid fellows!

155
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,254
You advocate to tell the truth
but come to hit me when I say the truth

156
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,324
Let me grow up

157
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,918
Let the moustache come
I will deal with you

158
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,223
You go to hell

159
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,899
I walked out of my
town telling that

160
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,434
Ok, How do people manage to tell
something which is not true?

161
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,834
I am unable to understand that

162
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,937
- Child what is your name?
-Naanu (Me)

163
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,908
No, no, is your name like Rama, Krishna?

164
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,673
I had told you my name is Naanu (Me)

165
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,910
Why should I keep the
name like Rama or Krishna?

166
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,246
My name is Naanu
I am me(Naanu)

167
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,014
ls Naanu a small boy?

168
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,088
Is that small boy in love with Rathi?

169
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,022
That's where the
thrill of the story lies

170
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,493
I swear on my mom, it is indeed
that small boy who is loving this Rathi

171
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,532
Think how is it possible?

172
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,869
It's not enough for body alone to grow
knowledge should also be grown

173
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,873
Brother, why were you
caught up with him?

174
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,703
He will elaborate the 2 minute
story of a 2 hour movie in 2 days

175
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:51,439
He is telling the 20 years back story
when Naanu was a small boy

176
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,718
How is the opening thrill?

177
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,121
Where the hell has he gone?

178
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:02,222
Pick him up - Oh gosh!
What did you say?

179
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,623
Where is Naanu?

180
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,127
I won't leave you
Where is Naanu?

181
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:16,624
<i>K 1</i>

182
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,433
<i>There is nothing tastier than the salt!</i>

183
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,447
<i>Those who agree this are not foolish!</i>

184
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:04,785
<i>I don't have the parents
Here I am everything for myself</i>

185
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:11,679
<i>k 1</i>

186
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,836
<i>I've thousand desires!
This earth is my foot ball!</i>

187
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,170
<i>I am a diamond for myself
I am a hitball to the enemies</i>

188
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,510
<i>I won't bow down to anyone</i>

189
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,182
<i>I won't bow down to anyone
lam a fire ball!</i>

190
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:18,746
<i>k 1</i>

191
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,413
<i>It's only after my birth
The hundred corer gods have born</i>

192
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,484
<i>It's only after I opened the eyes
The sun and the moon have born</i>

193
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,927
<i>There is nothing without me!</i>

194
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:32,431
<i>There is nothing without me!
And only if I am here!</i>

195
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:38,826
<i>k 1</i>

196
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,992
What, has that Naanu died?
-His body will be in pieces now

197
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,865
Even corporation won't
come to touch his body

198
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,802
By now dogs and foxes
would have ate his body

199
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,169
Even dogs and foxes would
feel dirty to touch him

200
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,902
He is that much a worst fellow

201
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,043
Why are you so raged against him?
What mistake that has he done?

202
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,448
If one starts telling his dirty deeds
even the mountain will blast into pieces

203
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,746
He is such a nonsense fellow,
loafer, sinner, dirty fellow

204
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:29,987
Yes I am a worst fellow, sinner,
loafer, evildoer, third class fellow

205
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,720
What is now for that?
What have you to do for that?

206
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,661
- Haven't you ever done
a mistake? -No brother

207
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,428
No brother I haven't done
anyihing wrong, please leave me

208
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,561
What, haven't you done
anyihing wrong ever?

209
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:41,871
Haven't done anything wrong!

210
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,463
Come here - Leave me

211
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,599
Do you consider yourself as
the lord Sri Ramachandra ofthis area?

212
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:47,005
- Leave me
-Come here

213
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,407
Look there, Lord Ganesha
the god with elephant head

214
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:50,672
The elephant god, Lord Vinayaka

215
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,646
Swear on this God that
you have never done a mistake

216
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:54,615
I will prostrate before you

217
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,687
Otherwise you've to act
according to my writs

218
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,082
Touch, Swear, Touch

219
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:02,283
This is a very powerful God
See he has lost his leg for lying

220
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:05,861
See he has became an insane
Touch it, Swear

221
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,430
I lost my leg by
swearing on Lord Ganesha

222
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:16,196
Brother, are these all necessary?

223
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:19,510
I have done small mistakes
-Have you? Small mistakes

224
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,206
You have done a big mistake

225
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:26,179
You are also a scoundrel
Everybody is dirty

226
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,444
- I declare it. Others don't,
that's all -No

227
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,521
Take the money out
- No

228
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,849
You made this money by cheating others

229
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,790
- Keep this 10 rupees
-Oh gosh!

230
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,451
You scoundrel, Let this
sinned money be with this sinner

231
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,062
I will spend this for sinful deeds

232
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:50,396
Yes brother, he used to
extort money from the people

233
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:53,905
He used to work with everyone by
claiming himself as a dirty and sinner

234
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,645
Once he fully boozed in our bar

235
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,075
I asked him the money, is it wrong?

236
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:02,076
Yes it is wrong

237
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:05,613
First of all it's wrong
to open a arrack shop

238
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:11,759
Despite spoiling us by selling drinks
you are asking for money

239
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:16,357
Do we need to spoil by giving money
after spoiling ourselves by drinking?

240
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,592
If Mahatma Gandhi were to be alive
today, he would have fired you

241
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,032
So many people have came to
the streets by drinking in your shop

242
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:30,773
Today you stay in the street
Scoundrel

243
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,344
He is asking for money

244
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,284
Nobody is waiting
for me in my house

245
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:48,796
Don't you have sympathy on your son?
Don't you love your son?

246
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,491
What is the time now?
What is the time now? -12'o clock

247
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,797
Don't you feel tense that your son
has not yet reached till 12'o clock?

248
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,633
Y0uv've switched off the lights
ate like the bulls

249
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,401
...and slept like the dead bodies

250
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,143
lam the one who'll fulfill
your death rituals

251
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,149
Only I would do it

252
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,484
Don't you love your son?

253
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,720
I feel ashamed to
call you mom and dad

254
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:20,828
I have some work in the morning
Wake me up early

255
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,029
- Take it
-Mat!

256
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,969
I will sleep inside
You sleep on the mat

257
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,070
- Seems mom, dad
-Sinful deeds!

258
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,832
- Sinful deeds!
- We can't do anyihing

259
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:32,533
Are you his father?

260
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,174
Everybody in this town
are his father and mother

261
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,509
He would go to the house of his choice
and make merry over there

262
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:40,844
Soon after waking up in the morning...

263
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,986
Damn!

264
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,186
Is this a tiffin?

265
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,849
I rarely come here

266
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,190
But you have
deliberately added salt in this

267
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,590
Not like that!
- Not like that!

268
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,461
I will smash your face

269
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:55,189
You will go to the hell if you
can't give the tiffin to your son

270
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,393
Time and again
you are saying as father and son

271
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:03,573
We have grown our son very good

272
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:04,740
ls he your son?

273
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,207
I came here after hard toils but
you claim this fatso to be your son

274
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,215
You are a loafer father, a rogue, a sick

275
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:17,481
See, you will be destroyed for
troubling hard working people like us

276
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,418
Hard working!

277
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,216
Do you work hard?
-No -lt's farmers who work hard

278
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,882
Farmers grow rice by hard work

279
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,756
Someone brings that to
the store by hard working

280
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,260
People buy it by working hard

281
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,796
What the hell would you
do in between? Seems hard working!

282
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,128
You are enjoying quietly
in your father earned property

283
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,360
- This fat fellow will enjoy
your property - Oh gosh!

284
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,569
You fat fellow
You scoundrel!

285
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,833
Our country does not
need fat fellows like him

286
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,466
We need people like Vishweshwarayya
who studied under the street light

287
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:42,907
Not fat fellows
like these for India

288
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,241
You fatso, dirty fellow, loafer!

289
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,380
First of all it's wrong for a
son to enjoy his father's money

290
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:51,283
If I were to become a PM I'll ban
which allows father's property to son

291
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,390
I will do such that
father's property doesn't go to son

292
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,992
Only then people like you won't
make properties for four generations

293
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,154
Everybody will be equal
You fat fellow!

294
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,425
Iam also your son like him, mind it

295
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,201
Why can't I become your son?

296
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,703
Bloody this fellow has become a rice
bag by eating all the rice in the store

297
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,932
Four families can eat his one time's meal

298
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:13,505
Father he has come!

299
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:18,347
Mother it's my dress!
My necklace, my glass!

300
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:19,882
My glass, my dress

301
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,986
You stupid, Mind you there is
nothing for anyone in this world

302
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,144
You can't even take your
body with you when you die

303
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,653
Seems my dress!

304
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,955
Fantastic hair style

305
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,871
You scrap go away
Stupid laughing at me

306
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,111
Oh gosh!
-Look at that crazy fellow

307
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,143
Why are you looking at me like that?
- What

308
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,678
Are you asking me the same?

309
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,912
It's my wish I can wear and roam
Who the hell are you to ask me?

310
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,255
You too have a desire to wear like this

311
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,587
You live for the people
but I live for myself

312
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,927
That's all the difference, go away

313
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:08,463
I will chop you if you
laugh at me, What do you think of me?

314
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:12,330
You enjoy it when shown on MTV or Zee TV
but you laugh at me if I wear the same

315
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,671
They are laughing

316
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,168
Where has my filter bidi gone?

317
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:21,004
Hey Kathri Rama- Greetings!
- Look how they are laughing at me?

318
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,680
They don't have a taste?
Look how is this dress?

319
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,179
That is...
- Tell me how is it?

320
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,511
It looks strange!
- You too don't have a taste

321
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,518
Look at this one, it's nice -It's out of
fashion, throw it, why keeping all this?

322
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,019
Brother see this lover dress

323
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,350
Lover dress! Ok keep it
I will wear it when I make love

324
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,686
- Look there
-Look at this piece

325
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,358
Don't call it a piece it's a latest fashion

326
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,700
That aunty looks excellent!-Yes!

327
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,046
Look at that aunty
What a make up, what a structure!

328
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,205
Let's play Kabadi for 5 minutes
- Leave me

329
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,543
Leave me - Why do you behave like that?
Haven't you ever played the Kabadi?

330
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,219
I will just finish in 2 minutes

331
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:07,049
- Leave me -Why do you behave
like that? -I won't eat you

332
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,123
I dared to catch you
because I liked your figure

333
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,886
What do you think of me?
Look at this

334
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,722
Don't spoil my mood by showing that

335
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,390
You stupid! Being a married woman
why do you roam like this?

336
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,999
You wear a simple
night dress before your husband

337
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,071
But here you wear
to arouse the onlookers

338
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,572
Why, Why tell me?
You want everyone to look at you

339
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,403
You want everyone to like you

340
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:29,409
What can I do?
I liked you and came to catch you

341
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,241
Come, just for 2 minutes

342
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,748
Don't lie, you too have the desire
Come just for 2 minutes

343
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,248
You are crossing your limits

344
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,911
Girls are unable to roam freely
What do you think of yourself?

345
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,581
Damn! Look there
You mean girls!

346
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:48,754
You stupid, everyone here desire for her
but nobody claim it openly but I do

347
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,958
Yes I am a womaniser,
a dilly fellow, a worst fellow so what?

348
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,933
I liked her and I want her

349
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,665
He would tease all women like this

350
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,604
I can't believe you

351
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,937
I am a big rowdy here
even I am scared of police and law

352
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,673
How could he do that?
Haven't you gone to the police?

353
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,647
Look at that lawyer,
he is Naanu's friend

354
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,276
He would keep anticipatory
bail always with him, he is a rogue

355
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,619
He would give that to police
whenever they come to arrest him

356
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:19,126
Nobody was unable to arrest him
But Sridhar managed to get him arrested

357
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,958
But they vacated their house
after he came out within 10 days

358
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:22,997
What did he do?

359
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:27,797
That Sridhar's wife is so good,
she is so pure, but that Naanu...

360
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,133
I feel sorry for you

361
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,503
When does your husband go? He leaves for
office at 8'0 clock in the morning

362
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,302
And returns at 8'0 clock in the evening

363
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,977
Untill then you live like a
dead body between these 4 walls

364
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,150
Look how beautiful this world is..

365
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,647
Look at the sky, look that crow
is flying, look at the light post

366
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,488
Have you seen all these?
Come out I'll show you many things

367
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:57,326
After all what is your age?
36 years, 40

368
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,331
But you are still like an apple

369
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,668
Do you know how long your
youth will stay? 5 years or 10 years

370
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,538
How many days are
there in a year? 365 days

371
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,009
3650 days for ten years, that's all

372
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,509
You will lose your youth
within this 3650 days, think about it

373
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,209
Look now
Look at this bottle

374
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:20,849
Look it has broken

375
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,019
It was there before one minute
but now it has broken

376
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,026
That's all our life
We shouldn't bother for the past

377
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,223
Do you know what Kunthi
and Krishna did in Mahabharatha?

378
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,532
Everybody is just like that

379
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:33,202
Our life will break like this bottle,
think about it

380
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,871
Be courageous
Nobody is looking a us

381
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:45,538
You can't deserve a man like me
Don't be scared, open the door

382
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,420
Pray to the Lord Krishna,
nothing will happen

383
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,557
Girls shouldn't cry in this era

384
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,894
Yes I am a sinner,
dilly fellow, worst fellow

385
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,257
Others don't claim it but I do,
that's all the difference

386
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:08,059
What is your mother's age?
36 years, you are 16

387
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,070
If she has that much lust,
what about you?

388
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,435
There is nothing good
and bad in this world

389
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:16,234
Everybody thinks in their own view point
You should not cry like this

390
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:20,915
Both India and Pakistan have bombs
We may die tomorrow if bombed

391
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,414
Our life is not in our hands

392
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:27,083
So, don't cry. Be happy
in this MTV and Zee TV era

393
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,592
Come, I will show you the
good heaven in this bad hell

394
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,769
Do fairn and good deeds
prevail in this world?

395
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,774
I will chop him, I will chop
his limbs if he comes here

396
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,780
Who is that?
- He is Naanu

397
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,136
Oh gosh! Run

398
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,486
Seena, why are you going scared?

399
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,367
Stop, I will come

400
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,332
Show your feet
- Why, what happened?

401
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,665
Why, what happened?
- Show your feet, Oh gosh!

402
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,171
Show your feet
-What happened?

403
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,206
Where are you dear?
-Why? What happened?

404
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,871
I want to clean my cruel deeds
by prostrating before you

405
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,516
I had seen so many people
but not a strange one like this

406
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:03,176
Dilly fellow, loafer, sinner, he had
chopped off 4 people in front of me

407
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,015
How come you love him?

408
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:08,016
Only you have remained
till now, to scold me

409
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,716
He has not murdered,
they are all his friends

410
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,522
By now he might be
drinking with them somewhere

411
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,629
He often does these tricks
to dupe the people

412
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,827
Let it be, everybody hates him

413
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:22,029
He lives by cheating others...

414
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,037
...and you are like a beautiful deer
how did love started between you two?

415
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,370
I will tell you, Look there
He is my father Subbashastri

416
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:33,380
You are a sinner
A great sinner

417
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:36,042
You give sacred water to everyone
in the town, now drink my sacred water

418
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,518
For what mistake of mine
that you are troubling me like this?

419
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,384
First of all it's wrong
for you to be with the God

420
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,554
The God itself is the
world's biggest mistake

421
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,886
People come after doing cruel deeds.

422
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:49,055
...but you create the illusion that they
are clean by giving your sacred water

423
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:53,559
They will come again
committing more misdeeds

424
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,237
You are the creator of the sinners

425
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,601
This sacred water is better than yours

426
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,402
This will remove the filter
between the tongue and the soul

427
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:01,910
Everything inside will come out

428
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,081
This is the God according to me
Oh God! Drink it

429
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,741
It's good, better than
that sacred water, Drink it

430
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:11,115
Come tomorrow I will
give you the 'Prasadam'

431
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,084
<i>Go</i>

432
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,589
I feel trembling

433
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,434
Oh gosh! Father what happened?

434
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:27,093
That Naanu made me
drink the sacred water

435
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,437
I was sewing sacred water to all,
but he mad me drink the sacred water

436
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,287
Are you a human being?
Are you humane?

437
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,787
Why did you make
my father drink that difly water?

438
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,956
Daughter of the priest

439
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,286
Has your father has
come from the heaven?

440
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,301
You mean, only he alone is perfect
and the rest are dirty fellows?

441
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,461
I am the dirty, loafer, sinner, so what?

442
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:07,004
Are you a very good person?
Haven't you ever done a misdeed?

443
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,811
Come here

444
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,205
Swear on this Lord Ganesha that
you haven't ever done any misdeed

445
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,975
I will prostrate before you, swear!

446
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:19,054
Swear it, it's a very powerful Ganesha
Your limbs will be paralysed if you lie

447
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:24,024
Look some bad thoughts might have come
but I have never done a misdeed

448
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:28,324
I swear on this Ganesha
I have never done a misdeed

449
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,366
Oh my girl! Do girls like you
still prevail in this country?

450
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,509
Give the xerox copy of your feet I'll
pray it daily - What are you doing?

451
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:44,512
Not a misdeed at this age!
Show me your feet - Oh gosh!

452
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,187
No more cover up

453
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,187
He made me drink liquor in front of public

454
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:01,359
Why should I drink by covering up?

455
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:05,366
- Father! -Shut up
Who is your father?

456
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:12,539
I have links with
Pancha Rangamma and the ministers

457
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:15,372
Do you call me father?

458
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,545
See, see!

459
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,715
Do you know why this get up?

460
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,918
For you only

461
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:26,382
For someone to come to
marry this Shastrfs daughter...

462
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,415
...and tie the knot without dowry

463
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:34,893
To reduce the worries about you

464
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:41,898
lfl had a son instead of you...

465
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:43,731
...would have worn coat and suit...

466
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:48,741
...and roamed with joy
while enjoying the booze

467
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:52,743
But it's due to my cruel
deeds that you were born to me

468
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:56,780
Only that God has
given me this knowledge

469
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,917
Hadn't the Lord
Krishna done the mistake?

470
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:04,256
Hadn't the Lord Rama
done the mistake? -Yes he had

471
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,587
Hadn't the Indra done the mistake?

472
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,100
Did you see? Did you see the
miracle of my sacred water?

473
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,765
Do you know the truth?

474
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,109
That's why everybody should drink

475
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,267
I used to think when I drink...

476
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:27,447
...how beautiful it would be if everyone
float with joy while boozing

477
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,952
Then there will be no communal violence

478
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,447
No Politics, no quarrel between
mother in law and daughter in law

479
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:36,957
Everybody will be enjoying joyously
How good our country will be then?

480
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,626
If I ever become the PM of this country
never mind getting loan from the IMF

481
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:46,462
I will make arrangements to supply wine
to every house through the tap

482
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:53,469
I don't know at which inauspicious time
I was born to my parents

483
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:58,474
There is a filter between here and here
I have born without that

484
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,641
That's why everylhing comes naturally
It's all the dilly here

485
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,648
Your poor father told all
the truth after drinking

486
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:07,687
That's why you feel sad

487
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,826
Everybody will feel sad if the
truth is told, and tears in the eyes

488
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,320
People feel sad about me
because I speak the truth

489
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,157
I am a worst fellow, dilly fellow

490
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,993
You are still not matured, a small girl

491
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,830
You have not yet seen this world properly

492
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:24,196
See the world wearing this cooling glass
Then you will know the real world

493
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:58,865

You are not loving him</i>

506
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,373
<i>No, you are loving him,
You are doing, you are doing</i>

507
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:46,137
<i>She cover up for the husband
And 'bay watch' for the friend</i>

508
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:55,648
<i>He is 'top ten' in the house
And 'fountain' in the bar</i>

509
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:59,056
<i>Super show for outside
And horror show inside</i>

510
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:02,323
<i>This is the midnight spice dear!</i>

511
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:07,787

00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,212

00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:02,686
<i>Will you come to 'Khandala'?</i>

514
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:09,224
<i>Sun TV's your choice!</i>

515
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,162
<i>Lovely scenes in the eyes!</i>

516
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,499
<i>The city channel!
Lovely tunes!</i>

517
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:18,732
<i>lam the Mr. Udhaya TV!</i>

518
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:24,397
<i>k 1</i>

519
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,814
See there, both blind couple are in love

520
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,993
Why do you go away when
I come close to you?

521
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:47,561
Just to avoid both of us coming closer
To make you sit there

522
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,992
Love me

523
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,029
Don't be funny

524
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:57,002
Can't you understand if said once?
Love me from there itself

525
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:58,737
Love me

526
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,537
You are there and I am here
how can we be romantic?

527
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,475
Look at them, how they are loving?

528
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:08,510
Do you want to love like that?

529
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,141
That's not love, it's TT

530
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:12,914
If you ask for TT instead of love
I would have agreed even to that

531
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:16,422
- What do you mean by TT?
-To fulfill the lust

532
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,303
You got tense for just saying this

533
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,848
What if it had really happened?
ls it necessary for you?

534
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:44,976
Those guys don't know what is love
See how they are stretching by hugging

535
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,750
Dilly fellows!
After reaching their adolescence...

536
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:50,655
...make love wherever
they find a little space

537
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:54,388
Damn! They are not ashamed
to love in the park

538
00:45:54,786 --> 00:45:57,289
They even make love even
in the Maruthi 800 car

539
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,593
They claim love

540
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,600
They roam doing this
by claiming it as pure love

541
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,864
I have already done
this kind of love several times

542
00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:07,405
I have enjoyed this
for a mere 300 to 500 rupees

543
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:08,736
That is not the love at all

544
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,074
My love with you is
not the English love, mind you

545
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:15,309
It's pure Kannada love,
adoration, affection

546
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,146
Affection is the essence of life

547
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:21,279
Look, love means above this
Nothing below this can be love

548
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,585
Tell me frankly, do you want
that kind of love? I am ready

549
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,285
I am ready for that right now
Do you need that?

550
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:30,023
Oh gosh! ls it wrong to say that
I will sleep and sit beside you..

551
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,759
...and you are lecturing me?

552
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:35,234
I am not a third class student
I can understand all this

553
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,431
You are not really loving me
You are just acting like that

554
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:43,440
Am I not loving you?
Can I prove it?

555
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:45,778
Prove it, how can you do it

556
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,343
Turn, Turn that side

557
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:58,954
Oh gosh! What are you doing?

558
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,920
What? ls he dead?

559
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:04,457
He is not, he stayed in
the hospital for two and half months

560
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:07,126
Then only our love bosomed further

561
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,337
You said he attempted to
kill himself for love..

562
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:11,407
...and you came to me
in the midnight for him

563
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,135
Your love is so deep,
then what is the problem?

564
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:15,801
Haven't you got him yet?

565
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:28,046
- Whose invitation is this?
-He is going to marry that Keeithi

566
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:38,362
Brother! What happened?

567
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:41,833
He is after Keerthi now
Don't tell anything about him

568
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,869
Keeflhi! Who is that Keeflhi?

569
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,895
Do you know who am I?

570
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:19,531
How dare you talk
like this despite knowing?

571
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:23,542
Just do what I say
No ministers and all here

572
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,370
Keep the phone you scoundrel

573
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:29,548
- Madam Nagappa has come
I mean that matter -Wait for sometime

574
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,884
Naidu, Who is the PA
ofthat excise minister?

575
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:35,548
He is Ramkumar
Call him over phone - Ok

576
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,717
- What is it?
- Madam, this file...

577
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:39,427
Take it madam

578
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:48,226
- Mother, something came up. -Dear,
why do you come like a rocket?

579
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,230
He is my son

580
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:54,903
Dada Singh and all
should be sidelined before him

581
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:56,739
Oh gosh, he looks so handsome!

582
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,744
You boast me later
there is an urgent matter

583
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,246
- What is that?
-Come close

584
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,928
Madam he is that man

585
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,124
Madam forgive me
I won't do it again

586
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,446
Madam what are you doing?

587
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:32,774
No!

588
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,948
Oh gosh?
-Don't do that

589
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,953
Oh gosh! What have you done?

590
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,495
We could have inquired him
But you have killed him

591
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,964
Shut your mouth. Before you finish the
inquiry we might've been robbed

592
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,635
That Keerthi is our property...

593
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:55,294
...he tried to kidnap her

594
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:56,494
What are you doing then?

595
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,640
What was your depaflment doing then?
Was it looking after donkeys?

596
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:04,144
It is the lesson for everyone who dare
to keep eye on our Keeflhi. Understood

597
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:08,477
Throw it on the road
Take this, you did the murder

598
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,379
Take him away, arrest him

599
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:12,886
- Madam - Go, I will
get you released - Ok

600
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,851
- Go
-Come

601
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,492
It would've been good if we
murdered him before Keeflhi

602
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,327
She is scared of blood

603
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,662
You tell her about this later
Where is Keeflhi now?

What are you doing here? I searched
for you everywhere, you know?

625
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,309
Sitting here, what are you thinking?

626
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,811
I was thinking about that Keeflhi

627
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:45,980
I was just thinking about my
life style, ifl get that Keerthi

628
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,516
I was thinking how happy I would be

629
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:56,490
Why? Why the tears in your eyes?

630
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:02,000
I may be marrying her
but I am not loving her, I hate her

631
00:56:02,493 --> 00:56:03,995
lam loving you only

632
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,835
Have you gone mad? How can
you love me and marry her?

633
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,337
Why? Why not?

634
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:13,012
According to me love
and marriage are different

635
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:16,014
Lovers are unable to marry
and married can't love

636
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,847
I have never ever lied

637
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:20,353
I can swear on any God if you tell

638
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:21,849
I love you only

639
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:28,022
I haven't hated anybody
so much in my life than Keeflhi

640
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:32,526
Still I won't leave her
I will marry her at any cost

641
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,203
Why? Why are you marrying
her if you hate so much?

642
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,530
Because...

643
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:39,033
Man wants to triumph when he loses

644
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:42,374
Hate develops when he aspires to win

645
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:46,044
I was living like a king in my own den
without knowing victory and defeat

646
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,708
Then one day...

647
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:51,044
Someone took me to a different world

648
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:54,552
Oh gosh!

649
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,221
Greetings sir!

650
00:56:57,548 --> 00:57:00,222
What a great building you have built?
You are great

651
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:02,058
He is a gate keeper, Come on

652
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,059
You loafer, dressed like a king
but happens to be gate keeper

653
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,394
What Master! The nation is spoiled...

654
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:09,561
...Gate keepers are dressed like
a king - Come quietly

655
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,066
So many lights!

656
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,569
They seem like prostitutes
Let me ask if they could come

657
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,570
They are not like that
They are rich people's children

658
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,246
Don't the rich people have desires?
Don't they eat salt and spice?

659
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:25,081
Who the hell is he?
-They eat but not much like you

660
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:26,243
Come quietly man

661
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:28,946
- Greetings sir
- Greetings

662
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,426
Oh gosh!

663
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,262
Master! When did India become foreign?

664
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,429
What Master! These loafers
have put all the lights on

665
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:44,131
But people are suffering
without power outside

666
00:57:44,328 --> 00:57:47,434
Look there, she is Keerihi
This company's proprietor

667
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,665
Are you dreaming?

668
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:19,304
Come what may, I need her tonight

669
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,340
I will throw at her ten thousand
rupees by getting credit

670
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,978
Let me ask her if she comes

671
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,643
Why are you laughing?

672
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:31,483
You won't get her even for a
minute if offered one corer rupees

673
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,322
Do you know about her background?

674
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,327
She is the only heir
for all that properties

675
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,166
Her one day income
runs into several cores

676
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:48,325
But she can't sell them

677
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,831
Even if she dies nobody
can get her property

678
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:52,497
Her father has written such a will

679
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:56,338
Whoever marries her
only can enjoy that propefly

680
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,707
That's why so many
people are longing for her

681
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,209
But she is clever

682
00:59:01,338 --> 00:59:03,340
She is mesmerizing
without being caught by anyone

683
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:07,048
She sucks and throws
men like a sugar cane

684
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,349
Oh, is it like so?

685
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,855
You know who am I?

686
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:15,197
Ifl intend I can make her
follow me within 2 minutes

687
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:18,863
Do that first if really you are a man

688
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:20,867
I will prostrate thousand times before you

689
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,035
Do you challenge my manhood?

690
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:27,368
I will carry her
in front of your eyes, See it

691
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,209
Oh gosh!

692
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:39,050
Keeflhi, I need you tonight

693
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,383
My head is spinning
after seeing your figure

694
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,716
Ask me how many lakes you need
I will throw it at your feet

695
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,896
I need you tonight

696
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:57,728
Oh gosh!

697
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,241
Naanu (me)

698
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:07,271
Naanu did you see the
new world? Did you see?

699
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,418
You are just a street dog

700
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,583
You haven't seen the
jungle of tigers and lions yet

701
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:16,249
By bullying the children
and the old men in your area..

702
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:19,088
...do you think that you're a man?

703
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:23,587
If you have the real strength, show here
Or else accept that you can't

704
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,266
I just asked her for tonight

705
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,606
Now I have decided

706
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,601
She must be with me every night

707
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,770
I won't leave her

708
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,439
I will definitely marry her

709
01:00:39,536 --> 01:00:43,279
I will also enjoy all the comfort
and the happiness that she is enjoying

710
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,453
I will definitely marry her

711
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,468

740
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:58,750
Mother had killed that fellow
who tried to kidnap you

741
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,913
Not that, I heard someone is
distributing my wedding invitation cards

742

It is him, who is distributing the
invitation cards by attacking everyone

743
01:03:06,383 --> 01:03:07,259
How dare he does that?

744

Keeflhi don't worry
It's a barking dog, I will chop the tail

745
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,774
It is because of your father's will...

01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,637
...no men should
ever dare to stare at me

753

01:05:54,818 --> 01:05:56,923
You loafer

01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,599
Are you the genius here?

775
01:05:58,722 --> 01:06:03,262
I know you will come here

How dare you talk before me?

Do you need my
would be daughter in law Keeflhi?

780
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:16,613
Do you want to marry her?

781
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,454
Keeflhi is not anybody's propefly

782
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,456
I know about you
and your background

783
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,960
You came here as a servant
when Keeflhi was a kid

784
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:29,791
You turned as her guardian
after their parents died in an accident

785
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:33,833
You want to grab her property
by marrying her to your son

What are you doing?

803
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:57,241
Leave me

804
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,892
- What's all this?
- It's him

805
01:08:05,015 --> 01:08:07,256
It's him who distributed
invitation cards to marry you

806
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,401

Past is past, let him free

It's not like that, We shouldn't
leave him, it's our prestige...

810
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,607
Can you listen to me?

811
01:08:27,704 --> 01:08:28,580
Let them free

812
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:45,793

01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:52,432
Leave it, Let him do
whatever he wants

814
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,773
-sWho is she with him?
- She is his wife

Come, She would
feel happy to see you

838
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,421
Look, she is my wife

839
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:10,417
You know, I used to say about my lover

840
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,422
She is my lover
How does she look?

841
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,428
She is perfect to be my lover

842
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:22,433
She has the right age and
the choice. What do you say?

843
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:27,298
In fact she loves you more than I do

Yes, We always used to
talk about you

845
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,778
- Isn't it so?
-Yes

846
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:38,816
Everyiime I wanted to
tell you about my wife

847
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:42,687
But I would tend to forget that
whenever I am with you

848
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:45,122
- She is a good wife
-Just a minute come

Just a minute

850
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,292
My wife makes bournvita
and coffee very well, let's drink it

851
01:14:49,419 --> 01:14:50,955
- Did you have poison?
-Why do you talk like that?

852
01:14:51,921 --> 01:14:54,333
- Come just for a minute
-I will comeback

853
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,471
Are you playing with me?
What do you think of me?

854
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:04,043
I thought you may be
tough outside but good in inner self

855
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:07,637
You blame the whole world
Are you doing the right thing now?

856
01:15:07,737 --> 01:15:09,478
Who? Who said that
I blamed everyone as wrong?

857
01:15:09,572 --> 01:15:12,143
I am saying it from the beginning
nobody is perfect including me

858
01:15:12,275 --> 01:15:14,016
They are all dirty, me also

859
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:18,488
Do you know how many men
have extra marital relationship?

860
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:22,189
Do you know many women live with
their husband thinking about someone else?

861
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:27,198
Only if the walls and cot had eyes...

862
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,495
...there would've been
world wars held daily

863
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:32,363
Everybody change colors
like a chameleon

864
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,508
They don't claim but I do,
is it wrong?

865
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:37,735
You wouldn't have screamed
like this if you known about my wife

866
01:15:37,967 --> 01:15:40,504
Do you know who she is?
How she has came to me?

867
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:58,191
- Will you come?
-Yes

868
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:03,203
How much do you charge?

869
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:07,537
-15,000 rupees
-15,000 rupees!!

870
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:10,371
Do you think you are
the heroine of Titanic?

871
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,907
Mine is only 5 minutes work
Tell me the correct rate

872
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:16,217
Not a penny less than 15,000

873
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,783
What do you think of me?

874
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:20,888
Am I fool not to know about this trade?

875
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:24,225
I am a fool, that's why
I am asking for 15,000 rupees

876
01:16:24,347 --> 01:16:25,223
You mean?

877
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:28,895
I heard the rate is high for virgins
This is first time for me

878
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:32,225
Of course rate is high for
the fresh, but not this much

879
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:35,569
That's not only for my body
it's includes my virginity

880
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:36,761
Come if you like it

881
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:40,733
I will never retreat in my life
What's the rate you have told?

882
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:44,240
Take it

883
01:16:46,202 --> 01:16:47,044
Shall we go?

884
01:16:47,537 --> 01:16:50,177
- Where?- It doesn't matter where
forjust five minutes

885
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:52,583
That place is fine let's go there

886
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:55,915
Let's start the opening
ceremony in a grand manner

887
01:16:58,147 --> 01:17:01,924
Moon light, AC weather and
this is like a five star hotel for us

888
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,927
It's fine here
Shall we stafl here?

889
01:17:28,544 --> 01:17:30,455
What is this?
What are you doing?

890
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:35,288
I am counting the stars
-Are you counting the stars?

891
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:38,792
Did I give you 15,000 rupees
to count the stars?

892
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:43,300
You gave the 15,000 for
my body and virginity not for my soul

893
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:46,633
Oh gosh!
ls there a separate rate for your soul?

894
01:17:46,796 --> 01:17:51,506
Whatever I do I need hundred percent
satisfaction, Or else I won't do it

895
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,806
Tell me the rate for your soul,
I will throw it

896
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,177
You won't get it even
if you give me a corer rupees

897
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,185
Oh what a cheeky
customer I got tonight!

898
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:03,153
Go quickly by finishing your work

899
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:05,655
Lay down

900
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:09,329
Let me see who
wins the tussle today

901
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,338
Give back my money

902
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:24,235
- Why? - I will punch you
if you ask me why

903
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,674
Are you playing with me?

904
01:18:26,102 --> 01:18:29,549
I gave you 15,000 rupees
only because you are a fresh

905
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,343
Now you are hesitating

906
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:33,179
Now she says there is a
different rate for her soul

907
01:18:33,309 --> 01:18:36,688
You wouldn't have come here
if you really had the soul and virginity

908
01:18:36,846 --> 01:18:39,690
You might've saved your soul,
virginity by working as a dish washer

909
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:41,884
She is now hesitating
after coming to the road

910
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:45,361
Take this money

911
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:50,363
Why should I come to the road
if I were safe working as a dish washer?

912
01:18:50,493 --> 01:18:52,803
Why should I bother to sell my body
and virginity for 15,000 rupees?

913
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,933
Tell me why?
From where to where should I go?

914
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:59,046
People see a girl with wrong intention
They won't see our soul

915
01:18:59,168 --> 01:19:00,704
Tell me who bothers to see our soul

916
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:03,373
There is no soul for a girl
like you who had from the house

917
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:05,212
Yes, How can it be there?

918
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:09,878
Do you know what a poor girl
desires, when she attains pubefly?

919
01:19:10,546 --> 01:19:13,220
To settle down in life
with a good husband

920
01:19:13,349 --> 01:19:15,386
But how many
girls have that fortune?

921
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:19,392
We become a problem for
our parents when we grow up

922
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:25,736
Their problem get solved
if we get married to anyone

923
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:30,236
And our dream husband
will remain as a dream ever

924
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:34,942
But my parents don't have
the strength to do my marriage

925
01:19:36,706 --> 01:19:38,617
I need a job to be self reliant

926
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:39,752
Even if I get the job...

927
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:44,413
I had to work in the night
besides in the day with the boss

928
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,754
Instead of working day
and night duty for the same salary...

929
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:51,422
...l have decided to work
only in the night, is it wrong?

930
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,631
Wrong or right is only for the soul

931
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,267
But this stomach won't listen to that

932
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:01,438
This stomach asks, do whatever
but give me the food

933
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:05,609
Instead of suffering everyday
I have come here to suffer today

934
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:10,773
You should harden your
head to do the night duty

935
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,778
You should become
like a show room doll

936
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:15,486
You should act in the bed more
than the artiste who wins awards

937
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,317
Then only the rate increases

938
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:19,983
This world doesn't suit you

939
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:24,624
Now you go to the house
I will search a good job for you

940
01:20:24,754 --> 01:20:27,462
- What kind ofjob will you find me?
-Some job

941
01:20:27,623 --> 01:20:31,366
I don't need a temporaryjob
Can you get me a permanent job?

942
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:32,996
Permanent job!
-Yes

943
01:20:34,096 --> 01:20:37,305
To sweep the house and
put the Rangoli early in the morning

944
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,306
To wash your clothes,
to prepare the tiffin

945
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:44,306
To send you with smile while helping you
wear the shoes when you go to work

946
01:20:45,975 --> 01:20:47,477
To prepare the food in the afternoon

947
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:51,822
And to welcome you in the evening
by adorning flowers in my hair

948
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:54,494
To become a prostitute
if you wish in the night

949
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,831
To become mother for your children

950
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:04,000
You mean, are you asking indirectly
to marry and become your husband?

951
01:21:04,126 --> 01:21:07,539
No, I don't have belief in that

952
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:12,334
You are not my dream husband
and you can't become like him

953
01:21:13,002 --> 01:21:16,575
According to me,
wife is like a permanent job

954
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,013
A job without the salary

955
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:20,854
I am asking that job because...

956
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,847
...l can roam freely in this
society with that license

957
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:29,184
It can also be helpful to you
It will be definitely helpful for me

958
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:31,190
Will you give me that permanent job?

959
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:38,861
Ninty percent of wives don't say this

960
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:40,871
But you are saying this
That's all the difference

961
01:21:41,831 --> 01:21:43,868
I too don't have
anybody to claim mine

962
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,871
I don't have a house either
But I will arrange it for you

963
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:51,043
Let's go

964
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:54,554
We are living as husband
and wife only for this society

965
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,222
Whatever it is, she is my wife

966
01:21:56,712 --> 01:21:58,885
I am marrying Keeflhi for her money

967
01:21:59,115 --> 01:22:01,061
Let them go to hell
What will you do for me?

968
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:04,231
I will love you for life long
You, you..

969
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:09,228
Love whoever goes in the streets
Love them for life long

970
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:14,739
What did you asked me the other day?

971
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:16,901
You asked me to love you
Didn't you ask me love you?

972
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:18,238
You should have asked me then itself...

973
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:19,903
...Whether I would marry you or not
I would've denied then itself

974
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:23,073
You mad, everyone fall in love
to get married, Not for just like that

975
01:22:23,205 --> 01:22:24,741
Do you mean,
lovers should get married?

976
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,080
According to you Love is
just for marriage, isn't it?

977
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:29,987
If a man and a woman love each other
they should get married immediately

978
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:32,718
Why should they
roam making the English love?

979
01:22:32,815 --> 01:22:34,692
That is just to understand each other

980
01:22:34,784 --> 01:22:37,094
Just to understand and
to quit in case of misunderstanding

981
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:38,261
Isn't it that much?

982
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:44,435
Won't they understand each other
if they get married in 5 minutes?

983
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,304
<i>Useless stuff
It's</i> all <i>useless stuff</i>

984
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:50,638
Listen, I will tell you correctly
about the love and affairs in this world

985
01:22:50,866 --> 01:22:54,279
A 16 to 20 year old girl will
fall in love just if we blink the eye

986
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:56,849
A 20 to 25 year old girl will
fall just looking after the boy's level

987
01:22:56,972 --> 01:23:00,442
A girl above 25 will fall to
any man however bad he looks

988
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:03,180
But my love don't have
any of these problems

989
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:06,782
I am not loving with selfish

990
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:10,486
I am loving for my head
lam loving for my soul

991
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:14,294
I will always love you
I was cheated

992
01:23:14,423 --> 01:23:17,802
I wouldn't have turned to you
if you had said this earlier

993
01:23:17,927 --> 01:23:21,636
Get out from here,get out
Don't show me your face,get out

994
01:23:21,864 --> 01:23:24,902
You stupid, You will fall
in the sea if I kick you

995
01:23:25,134 --> 01:23:26,636
You don't know about love,
then why do you love ?

996
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,974
Didn't you hear me till now
about the love in the world?

997
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:31,983
Didn't I say about my love?
Seems to make love!

998
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:36,316
You know how dirty fellow am I?
I will cut you off if you play with me

999
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:39,322
You! will you cut me off?
Cut me off if you have the guts

1000
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:41,826
Do you threaten whom you love
by telling that you will cut off?

1001
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,987
Do whatever you want,
I will see it

1002
01:23:44,153 --> 01:23:46,326
- Not a threat, I will
do it in real - Leave me

1003
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:48,498
- You! -You just loved to fulfill your lust

1004
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:49,726
You stupid! stop there
Are you enacting the drama?

1005
01:23:49,825 --> 01:23:51,668
- I will break your head
- How dare you hit me with the stone?

1006
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,230
- Loafer, mad, crack!
Am I mad?- Come if you've the guts

1007
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:56,900
Do you want to kill me?

1008
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,010
- Do you call me crack for telling
the truth? - Don't come close to me

1009
01:23:58,133 --> 01:23:59,942
- I will get you caught by
the police -How dare you say so?

1010
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:00,843
- You stupid!
-Go, go

1011
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:06,510
You stupid! You girls need MG road boys
Why should you desire for me?

1012
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:10,122
I should have made English love with you
I don't have the sense

1013
01:24:10,246 --> 01:24:12,692
lam loving for my soul,
I am a stupid

1014
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:22,066
Are you making English love?

1015
01:24:22,191 --> 01:24:26,367
They fall in love but don't
know the meaning of the love

1016
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:32,039
Suma this is very strong, Next time
it will give you full satisfaction

1017
01:24:44,747 --> 01:24:45,885
Just ten lakes

1018
01:24:47,616 --> 01:24:52,565
I am fortunate to
have a boyfriend like you

1019
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:05,003
Even Aamir Khan, Salman Khan
should feel shy if you laugh

1020
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:16,221
Yes, this is the world!

1021
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:18,425
Only people with
money have the value

1022
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:21,921
I don't have money
that's why I don't have a value

1023
01:25:22,718 --> 01:25:24,925
I need that Keeflhi

1024
01:25:25,254 --> 01:25:27,256
It means I will get
everything ifl get her

1025
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:41,512
- Who are you?
- You stupid! How dare to ask me?

1026
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:43,279
Go that side

1027
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,243
He is coming with the police

1028
01:25:45,374 --> 01:25:48,287
Punish them all

1029
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:50,381
- You devil, Monster
- Leave me

1030
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:52,718
I had told you I will come at
12 '0' clcock, - Leave me

1031
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:54,122
- See, I've come with the police
- Leave me

1032
01:25:54,216 --> 01:25:56,457
Kick and arrest all of them

1033
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:59,462
Nobody should talk, ok

1034
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:02,658
I have to speak with
Keeflhi personally for 5 minutes

1035
01:26:02,758 --> 01:26:05,136
Don't disturb me
Lock them in that room

1036
01:26:05,427 --> 01:26:07,134
Push them inside

1037
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:10,275
I won't leave you
I will avenge you

1038
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:17,283
Keeflhi my darling!

1039
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,612
Sit down, Sit down all of you

1040
01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:21,754
I will murder you
if any one tries to flee

1041
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:23,548
You are the currency note

1042
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:28,187
They won't come here
They are all locked inside

1043
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:31,427
I have come here with
police protection, do you know?

1044
01:26:31,587 --> 01:26:34,158
You don't know
about my power yet

1045
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:36,161
You have to follow what I say

1046
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:38,237
- If not..
-What will you do?

1047
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:41,505
Do you mean what I will do?

1048
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:48,849
Oh gosh! What is this?
He is telling like this

1049
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:54,680
I can't hear this
- He is a dirty fellow

1050
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:58,017
- Oh gosh! What to do?
-Write it down

1051
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,352
Who allowed this loafer inside?

1052
01:27:02,017 --> 01:27:03,189
Write down

1053
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:06,996
Ours is a English and
Kannada paper not the Sanskrit

1054
01:27:07,089 --> 01:27:10,332
Nowadays Sanskrit papers
are in demand, write down

1055
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:14,196
You want a real man right?

1056
01:27:16,365 --> 01:27:18,675
You won't get a real man than me

1057
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,698
What if you are a crorepati,
or London queen, You are also a girl

1058
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:50,171
You have the same things like others

1059
01:27:52,401 --> 01:27:53,744
How is it? Write down

1060
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:57,910
You should announce your marriage
with me in front ofthe press people

1061
01:27:58,107 --> 01:27:59,142
Or else

1062
01:28:00,809 --> 01:28:05,053
Marry you! You even don't
have the value of my slippers

1063
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:09,919
You would've been nothing if
you had not born to your father

1064
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:13,429
You are basking in your
father's illegitimate money

1065
01:28:14,323 --> 01:28:16,599
This is my father's hard earned money

1066
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:20,069
If he cheated like you, he
would've been in footpath like you

1067
01:28:20,195 --> 01:28:22,675
That's why I am also facing hardness

1068
01:28:22,865 --> 01:28:26,813
I am also working hard like your father
who worked hard to make this propefly

1069
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:27,944
- What do you say?
- Yes

1070
01:28:28,036 --> 01:28:30,846
I am also taking the risk
It's not easy to get her - Yes

1071
01:28:31,006 --> 01:28:33,213
That Marimuthu, she is devil, a Monster

1072
01:28:33,342 --> 01:28:35,379
- She was waiting with a sickle
for me - Yes she was

1073
01:28:35,544 --> 01:28:37,615
- I also took risk
I have also entered with hard - Yes

1074
01:28:37,713 --> 01:28:40,785
- Give me that I am
marrying her, not for her -Yes

1075
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,790
I need this property

1076
01:28:44,987 --> 01:28:47,763
- Why should I need her?
I had seen a lot of girls like her - Yes

1077
01:28:47,856 --> 01:28:51,963
I need only her property
I want to enjoy like she does

1078
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:54,097
Damn! Don't you feel ashamed?

1079
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:56,636
Do you want to
live with a girl's money?

1080
01:28:57,466 --> 01:29:00,379
Why should I feel ashamed?
You should feel ashamed

1081
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:03,115
There are so many people in this
country without food and cloth

1082
01:29:03,372 --> 01:29:05,318
But she roams with style

1083
01:29:06,742 --> 01:29:10,246
The cost of her perfume can
feed four families for four times

1084
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:13,189
Seems her father a chieftain!
Claims him hard working!

1085
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:16,261
Hard working are those who
work in the Kalasipalyam market

1086
01:29:16,385 --> 01:29:17,489
That is hard working

1087
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:21,128
ls it possible to build this kind
of building by earning in a fair manner?

1088
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:25,160
Why for you if it's not for me?

1089
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:29,001
Why this stylish light
for you if it is not for me?

1090
01:29:30,265 --> 01:29:32,267
Why this TV for you
if it is not for me?

1091
01:29:32,434 --> 01:29:34,004
Why this fridge which
burns my stomach?

1092
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,683
Why this being stylish?

1093
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,854
Why this showcase items
for you if it is not for me?

1094
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,186
Why should I only
feel hard while you enjoy?

1095
01:29:44,913 --> 01:29:49,692
Why this one?
Why this for you if it's not for me?

1096
01:29:49,952 --> 01:29:51,192
You stupid!

1097
01:30:11,873 --> 01:30:14,877
Sir one request,
We need your personal details

1098
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:16,613
Where did you come from?
The name of your place

1099
01:30:16,812 --> 01:30:18,257
We need that for the coverage

1100
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:21,723
Look I can't give you more time

1101
01:30:22,217 --> 01:30:23,560
Decide quickly

1102
01:30:24,353 --> 01:30:25,957
Whenever it is
you must marry me

1103
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:31,727
Sir, Answer my question

1104
01:30:33,962 --> 01:30:35,498
ls everyihing over?
What should we do?

1105
01:30:35,664 --> 01:30:36,802
Go to hell

1106
01:30:39,101 --> 01:30:41,809
Just a minute

1107
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:43,078
Come on

1108
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:46,081
- Sir one minute
-Will you go from here?

1109
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:50,890
Come madam
Greetings madam, is everything 0k?

1110
01:30:51,046 --> 01:30:51,854
He has left

1111
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:55,918
He has spent ten minutes with Keeflhi
But I don't know what he did

1112
01:30:56,785 --> 01:31:00,358
You scoundrel why did you let him
to go to Keeflhi by locking us inside?

1113
01:31:00,489 --> 01:31:03,368
- You only said that
-What, did I said that?

1114
01:31:03,491 --> 01:31:08,099
You only said in the phone
that you should do like this

1115
01:31:08,363 --> 01:31:09,933
Now you are hitting me

1116
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:15,607
I don't need the strawberry but chocobar

1117
01:31:20,175 --> 01:31:21,119
Give me that

1118
01:31:31,753 --> 01:31:33,255
You look like a hero

1119
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:43,972
Shall we go?
Let's go to the movie

1120
01:31:44,766 --> 01:31:48,646
You loafer!
Do you make English love?

1121
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:51,374
How dare you buy her ice cream?
How dare you flirt with her?

1122
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:54,486
- Do you know who she is?
- Leave him

1123
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:56,986
- Go and pick up in the MG Road
- Leave him

1124
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:57,987
Do you try to pick up her?
Get up

1125
01:31:58,246 --> 01:31:59,316
- Do you make English love?
- Leave him

1126
01:32:00,182 --> 01:32:03,322
I will smash you if
you again come here

1127
01:32:04,953 --> 01:32:09,026
- Go away
-Honey, Stay there

1128
01:32:10,992 --> 01:32:11,834
<i>Go</i>

1129
01:32:13,395 --> 01:32:16,239
How arrogant are you?
Are you both playing with me?

1130
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:18,071
Are you roaming with
him to make me suffer?

1131
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,271
Yes I will do
I'll do whatever I want to

1132
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,346
Who the hell are you to ask that?

1133
01:32:22,437 --> 01:32:25,008
You mean who am I?
Did you ask me who am I?

1134
01:32:25,207 --> 01:32:28,848
You stupid! I will punch you
Lover, I am your lover

1135
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:30,352
Don't you feel ashamed
to say like that?

1136
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:32,855
A day before yesterday only you
told me to cut and dump me in the sea...

1137
01:32:32,948 --> 01:32:34,256
But today I have become your lover

1138
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:38,061
- I just said in a rage
-Do you alone feel enraged?

1139
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:41,064
You can marry someone else
and keep someone as wife..

1140
01:32:41,156 --> 01:32:44,000
...and you can love me
but we shouldn't do it, isn't it?

1141
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:47,004
I am also loving you
but marrying him, is it wrong?

1142
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:51,874
Only if we do it's wrong
not for you, isn't it?

1143
01:32:52,134 --> 01:32:57,208
- I wasn't aware of that
Are you really marrying him?- Yes

1144
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:01,046
Forgive me

1145
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:07,556
Oh enough these girl's matter

1146
01:33:13,355 --> 01:33:16,234
Please listen to me
I didn't come to hit you

1147
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:19,237
I have done it by mistake
I didn't know you were marrying her

1148
01:33:20,929 --> 01:33:23,569
- Please listen to me - No
-If you have the rage on me, please hit me

1149
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:27,110
Please try to understand, come
Come Rathi is waiting

1150
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:32,912
It is common in love

1151
01:33:33,275 --> 01:33:38,088
Take a good pain killer injection
Come, sit

1152
01:33:39,281 --> 01:33:42,091
Come Rathi, sit down

1153
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:43,823
Please don't mistake me

1154
01:33:44,486 --> 01:33:47,126
I didn't roam like this
before the marriage

1155
01:33:47,322 --> 01:33:49,461
Roam anywhere after the marriage

1156
01:33:49,758 --> 01:33:52,602
Rathi you marry him
But you are loving me only, right?

1157
01:33:53,762 --> 01:33:55,935
Tell me, you marry him

1158
01:33:56,164 --> 01:33:58,474
But love me for life long
Would you love me?

1159
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:03,274
Yes I will marry him, love you
and keep another as a husband

1160
01:34:04,306 --> 01:34:06,946
Don't make fun of me
I am asking seriously

1161
01:34:07,242 --> 01:34:10,746
You can marry him
but should love me only

1162
01:34:10,845 --> 01:34:14,019
Ok, I will love you
for life long, Let's go

1163
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:17,289
Oh gosh!

1164
01:34:40,141 --> 01:34:43,987
- Have you tread the bike
on my foot? -Leave him

1165
01:34:44,078 --> 01:34:48,993
- Have you done it intentionally?
-Leave him

1166
01:34:49,084 --> 01:34:51,826
Do you want more?

1167
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,332
I've sent her with you but
you rode the bike on me instead

1168
01:34:54,422 --> 01:34:56,800
- You stupid, I will kill you -Oh gosh!
I will kill you today -Oh gosh

1169
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:01,170
You didn't turn to see, when I crawled
in pain when the bike ran over my foot

1170
01:35:01,296 --> 01:35:04,903
You shouldn't have done like this
if you had truly loved me

1171
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:07,612
Leave me, mad
You are really mad

1172
01:35:07,736 --> 01:35:10,182
You are pulling my hair,
don't you think it will hurt me?

1173
01:35:10,305 --> 01:35:13,343
If you had really loved me
you wouldn't have done like this

1174
01:35:15,844 --> 01:35:18,484
Would you behave
like this which can hufl me?

1175
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:20,685
If your love is true
you should never hurt my feelings

1176
01:35:20,882 --> 01:35:25,353
You should always wish for the
well being of your lover, Isn't it?

1177
01:35:27,288 --> 01:35:30,201
There is a logic in
leading every life with lies

1178
01:35:30,392 --> 01:35:32,235
We have to accept the lie as the Life

1179
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:35,033
We can't live if we
listen to our soul always

1180
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:37,609
I was roaming with
that boy just to make you realise

1181
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:41,908
Why did you hit him
keeping all the mistakes with you?

1182
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:44,740
He made the English love

1183
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:50,783
Yes the love has the rage,
possessiveness and jealousy

1184
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:53,118
All these feelings comprise love

1185
01:35:53,948 --> 01:35:56,861
Yes it's true
True, true

1186
01:35:57,018 --> 01:35:58,395
Whatever you said was right

1187
01:35:58,887 --> 01:36:02,733
I tried many times to be
like that but I failed

1188
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:05,235
lam unable to live
like that in this world

1189
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,633
That's why you should become humane

1190
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:12,233
I love you very much
I know about you

1191
01:36:12,367 --> 01:36:14,540
No other girl will live
with you for a single day

1192
01:36:14,636 --> 01:36:18,743
Try to understand me, Change yourself
for my sake and leave those two

1193
01:36:19,908 --> 01:36:22,946
Truth is always dirty
Lies give joy

1194
01:36:23,311 --> 01:36:24,756
You also need an untrue life

1195
01:36:24,946 --> 01:36:27,950
From now onwards I'll listen
to you, I will just live like that

1196
01:36:28,183 --> 01:36:31,494
You are everything to me

1197
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:38,092
- Come -You mean you will
live with lying? -That's what you need

1198
01:36:38,226 --> 01:36:40,934
I don't want that
You should leave both of them

1199
01:36:41,262 --> 01:36:42,570
Sure I will

1200
01:36:42,664 --> 01:36:45,008
I won't be quiet
if you play with me again

1201
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:48,945
I will kill you and myself
if I ever see you with them

1202
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:55,144
I love you very much
I can't live without you

1203
01:36:55,276 --> 01:36:56,448
I too can't live without you

1204
01:36:58,846 --> 01:37:04,125
I love you very much, come

1205
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:15,808
Stay here, I'll be back

1206
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:22,310
Come here

1207
01:37:26,441 --> 01:37:27,647
I want to talk a little with you

1208
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:31,012
You had never talked little
You can talk in abundance

1209
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:32,817
I am talking very seriously

1210
01:37:33,615 --> 01:37:36,027
- You'll become cool in a little while
-I won't become cool

1211
01:37:36,117 --> 01:37:37,323
Ok, tell me what it is

1212
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:39,657
-I've taken a decision
-What's that?

1213
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:43,661
From today onwards
Rathi is everyihing to me

1214
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:46,502
My wife, my lover,
she is everything for me

1215
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:52,845
From now on she
will live in this house

1216
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:58,851
Let her live
Nothing wrong in that

1217
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:02,180
After all you are loving her

1218
01:38:02,410 --> 01:38:03,514
That's not the problem

1219
01:38:04,546 --> 01:38:07,857
You can't be here
if she lives in this house

1220
01:38:24,999 --> 01:38:27,741
I had promised you
to give the permanent job

1221
01:38:28,102 --> 01:38:30,207
I am breaking a promise
for the first time in my life

1222
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:33,878
There is nothing
permanent in this world

1223
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:37,215
You, me and this world,
nothing is permanent

1224
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:43,226
Ask me the salary for working
here till now, I will give you

1225
01:38:45,386 --> 01:38:48,560
Permanent job is a job without the salary

1226
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:52,894
In fact I have to give you
something for giving me the shelter

1227
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:56,901
- What will you give me?
- I had already given that

1228
01:38:57,598 --> 01:39:00,238
You can understand what that would be

1229
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:01,746
I will take leave

1230
01:39:46,147 --> 01:39:47,125
Come

1231
01:39:47,315 --> 01:39:50,455
It seems he has fainted
due to his head injury

1232
01:39:52,386 --> 01:39:53,956
- Are you ok?
- Yes I am

1233
01:39:59,494 --> 01:40:03,135
Get up
Get up

1234
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,141
How dare you try to kill me?

1235
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:08,981
Get up

1236
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:13,145
After wishing us to live together.
Now are you trying to kill me?

1237
01:40:13,675 --> 01:40:15,154
Are you a woman?

1238
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:19,313
I gave you shelter when you were
indulging in prostitution in the streets

1239
01:40:19,447 --> 01:40:20,323
Are you trying to kill me?

1240
01:40:20,849 --> 01:40:25,662
All these days you were
leading a bogus life with me

1241
01:40:25,787 --> 01:40:29,325
People like you should be finished
You are bitter against both of us

1242
01:40:29,523 --> 01:40:31,161
Get out you stupid!

1243
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:36,501
Get out from here

1244
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:39,341
Get out, don't show your face

1245
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:46,177
After all you were a prostitute
So is your behaviour

1246
01:40:46,875 --> 01:40:49,879
You don't worry
She is not good, a dirty fellow!

1247
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:52,687
Take her to your house

1248
01:40:52,847 --> 01:40:55,794
Ask your wife to take care of her
Just 2 days I will bring her back

1249
01:40:55,917 --> 01:40:57,225
- Go, go
- Come

1250
01:40:57,385 --> 01:40:59,023
- Do you have the problem?
-No

1251
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:04,536
Where is your wife?
I have come with the doctor

1252
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:06,696
Doctor! Don't utter her
name in front of me

1253
01:41:06,828 --> 01:41:07,863
why?

1254
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:11,703
She collapsed the roofjust to
kill me and Rathi, do you know that?

1255
01:41:11,866 --> 01:41:12,867
You have mistaken her

1256
01:41:13,001 --> 01:41:15,379
Her pulling of the roof
was not meant to kill you

1257
01:41:15,537 --> 01:41:18,541
- But to save you
-What? To save me?

1258
01:41:18,673 --> 01:41:21,051
Yes, When your wife came out...

1259
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:24,216
Come fast

1260
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:27,889
Which house?

1261
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:45,736
They shouldn't escape

1262
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,910
- Don't leave that loafer
- Come, come

1263
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:52,744
Search inside
Go search there

1264
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:59,421
Search everywhere
Come here, where is he?

1265
01:41:59,948 --> 01:42:01,586
Where is your husband?

1266
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:04,088
I will kill you today

1267
01:42:04,452 --> 01:42:07,592
- Tell me, Will you tell me
or not? -I don't know

1268
01:42:07,721 --> 01:42:10,634
How dare your husband does that?
Do you suppofl him?

1269
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:13,434
Don't you have the desire
on your sacred thread?

1270
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:15,266
Take this, this is permanent

1271
01:42:15,663 --> 01:42:18,109
That Marimuthu has hurt her enormously

1272
01:42:18,333 --> 01:42:19,778
Still she didn't tell the truth about you

1273
01:42:19,934 --> 01:42:22,608
She saved you by pulling the roof

1274
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:25,283
But you had discarded her from the house

1275
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:32,120
How can she live without you?
Go and bring her back

1276
01:42:46,494 --> 01:42:51,136
Please stay there
Please forgive me

1277
01:42:52,834 --> 01:42:55,815
- Why sorry?
- I did a very big mistake

1278
01:42:56,003 --> 01:42:58,483
I didn't know that you
had done that to save me

1279
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:02,487
- What are you saying?
- Yes I am saying it seriously

1280
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:05,486
I will never mistake you
from now on. Come with me

1281
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:08,490
You were alright little earlier
You go with that Rathi

1282
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:11,496
- Where are you going now?
- That is none of your business

1283
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:14,992
How and where a good girl
like you can live in this bad world?

1284
01:43:15,123 --> 01:43:18,002
I may be a dirty fellow
but this world is more dirtier than me

1285
01:43:18,193 --> 01:43:21,663
Instead of living with the myth
you can live a truthful life with me

1286
01:43:22,030 --> 01:43:24,169
What truth should I accept?

1287
01:43:24,866 --> 01:43:27,506
What is your real truth,
Shall I say the real truth?

1288
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:31,179
Do you know, I had said that
I had given you something?

1289
01:43:32,039 --> 01:43:34,019
I had already given my soul to you

1290
01:43:35,877 --> 01:43:40,348
I thought that a wife's job is
a slavery. No

1291
01:43:41,216 --> 01:43:46,029
Even though we had a compromise
marriage, still there is happiness

1292
01:43:47,222 --> 01:43:48,394
If love exists or not...

1293
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:50,198
After the marriage...

1294
01:43:50,558 --> 01:43:55,200
A tenderness develops quietly
between the husband and wife

1295
01:43:55,730 --> 01:44:00,543
That's why lakes of families
still live in that tenderness

1296
01:44:01,001 --> 01:44:02,537
If everything happened like you preach...

1297
01:44:02,737 --> 01:44:05,877
...Our country wouldn't be India
It would have become a foreign country

1298
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:13,388
That's why you should be
called the No.1 wife

1299
01:44:13,548 --> 01:44:14,390
Well said

1300
01:44:14,582 --> 01:44:17,563
I can't live by sharing you with others

1301
01:44:18,753 --> 01:44:21,563
Will you leave that Rathi and Keeflhi?
I will come with you

1302
01:44:21,756 --> 01:44:26,728
Yes I will
Yes, I am telling the truth

1303
01:44:26,928 --> 01:44:29,101
I need you
You should always be with me

1304
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:33,234
Don't play with me. You'll
change yourself every minute

1305
01:44:33,334 --> 01:44:36,577
No, I will remain firm
I will be like a great Indian

1306
01:44:37,271 --> 01:44:39,080
Please come

1307
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:43,585
I am not a permanent employee anymore
I will be like your real wife

1308
01:44:43,711 --> 01:44:45,247
Not like a wife,
you are indeed my wife

1309
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:46,756
Come

1310
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:50,922
lfl come to know that you are
again behind that Rathi and Keerthi

1311
01:44:51,052 --> 01:44:52,656
I will kill both of them and myself

1312
01:44:52,887 --> 01:44:54,764
And make sure that
you won't get anyone

1313
01:44:55,289 --> 01:44:56,427
Ok I will manage everyone

1314
01:44:56,557 --> 01:44:59,094
- What did you say?
-I mean, as you said

1315
01:44:59,193 --> 01:45:00,934
Give me, come

1316
01:45:24,986 --> 01:45:30,299
I have accepted you as my husband
Don't say like that, don't abandon me

1317
01:45:30,491 --> 01:45:33,802
I will live in the dog's room
in your home, please allow me

1318
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:39,470
Please, don't abandon me

1319
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,173
What to do, this woman is crawling?

1320
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:45,977
- Shall we keep her?
-As you say

1321
01:45:46,341 --> 01:45:49,151
- What do you say?
- As your wish

1322
01:45:50,511 --> 01:45:52,991
Ok come, I will have you also

1323
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,192
Money

1324
01:45:57,518 --> 01:45:59,998
Not only three we can keep
even six if we have the money

1325
01:46:00,521 --> 01:46:03,661
lfl get Keerthi,
I can have the threesome

1326
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:17,178
Oh gosh

1327
01:46:17,271 --> 01:46:19,182
- What happened? -Mother
Save me

1328
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:21,683
Oh gosh!
-What happened mother?

1329
01:46:21,809 --> 01:46:24,187
- Open the door
-What happened?

1330
01:46:24,379 --> 01:46:27,690
What happened?

1331
01:46:34,722 --> 01:46:38,693
- Oh gosh!
-What's all this

1332
01:46:38,893 --> 01:46:41,373
- Tell me what happened
-What happened?

1333
01:46:41,562 --> 01:46:43,371
- Ghost! Ghost!
- Where?

1334
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:44,872
- Where?
-There!

1335
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:48,873
What is this?
What are you talking about?

1336
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:50,708
- Who did all this?
- Where is the ghost?

1337
01:46:50,904 --> 01:46:54,044
The door is closed
Nobody can't come inside

1338
01:46:54,175 --> 01:46:55,552
Madam Naanu's phone

1339
01:47:00,248 --> 01:47:01,591
Did you see my power?

1340
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:04,062
I can do anything I wish

1341
01:47:04,919 --> 01:47:07,229
Agree to marry me
without the grudge

1342
01:47:07,421 --> 01:47:08,729
Or else!

1343
01:47:11,292 --> 01:47:13,067
Come in front of me if you have the guts

1344
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:17,074
Why should I come there?
I will control everyihing from here

1345
01:47:17,765 --> 01:47:19,608
Are you still in doubt
about my capacity?

1346
01:47:20,367 --> 01:47:23,246
Look at that Marimuthu's son
See how he falls down

1347
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:26,752
Oh gosh!

1348
01:47:34,449 --> 01:47:38,625
- Oh gosh!
-Ravi what happened?

1349
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:46,935
Did you see my power?
Will you agree now?

1350
01:47:47,128 --> 01:47:47,936
Will you?

1351
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:52,603
What happened?
Unable to get up

1352
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:56,111
Are all these his handiwork?
I am unable to understand anyihing

1353
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:59,679
I am scared
It's not good for you to stay here

1354
01:47:59,807 --> 01:48:03,118
Go to Delhi today itself
I will book a room in the hotel Oberoi

1355
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:10,622
Nair, not only in Delhi I won't let her
even if you keep her in Switzerland

1356
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:15,297
I too have booked a room in the
hotel Oberoi, I will meet her there

1357
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:19,467
-ls it him?
- Yes

1358
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,469
How can he know
about our talks here?

1359
01:48:23,497 --> 01:48:26,137
We can't believe the people here
There seems a conspiracy going inside

1360
01:48:26,267 --> 01:48:28,304
Everyone go outside, go

1361
01:48:28,603 --> 01:48:31,140
What are you looking at me?
You too go

1362
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:35,646
Come on Ravi, Come dear!

1363
01:48:43,017 --> 01:48:45,827
Go to our new
guest house stealthily

1364
01:48:52,192 --> 01:48:55,662
Keeflhi not only the new guest house...

1365
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:58,840
...l won't let you even if she
keeps you in the old guest house

1366
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:02,347
I will marry you at any cost

1367
01:49:08,976 --> 01:49:11,183
ls it him?
Does he know that as well?

1368
01:49:11,379 --> 01:49:14,189
Mother he seems
to be a magician, a diviner

1369
01:49:37,238 --> 01:49:38,080
Greetings!

1370
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:44,386
- What is all this?
-This is very little for your gesture

1371
01:49:45,413 --> 01:49:46,221
Are you fine?

1372
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:50,562
You both have the faith in me..

1373
01:49:50,918 --> 01:49:53,091
"But the Keeflhi isn't
falling to your trap

1374
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:57,224
She should have married me by now,
unable to bear your toflure

1375
01:49:57,425 --> 01:49:58,904
Still we are unable to
get her in our way

1376
01:49:59,026 --> 01:50:02,098
She is a modern girl
and intelligent too

1377
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:04,401
Will she believe that
I had the super natural power?

1378
01:50:04,598 --> 01:50:06,407
I think she might
have the doubt about you

1379
01:50:06,533 --> 01:50:10,913
No chance to doubt,
After both of us got injured like this

1380
01:50:11,939 --> 01:50:15,785
Keeflhi will lose confidence
on us after we got much injury

1381
01:50:15,943 --> 01:50:18,753
She might meet you directly

1382
01:50:18,946 --> 01:50:20,983
She has the licensed revolver with her

1383
01:50:21,115 --> 01:50:23,254
-ls it? -Isn't it?
-She may try to kill you

1384
01:50:23,384 --> 01:50:24,761
You don't worry...

1385
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:26,598
...Pour acid on her face

1386
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:29,792
She should become ugly
Then who will marry her?

1387
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:33,097
She should marry my son Ravi
having no other alternate

1388
01:50:33,227 --> 01:50:34,934
You both have made a good plan

1389
01:50:35,062 --> 01:50:36,837
Then what should I do?
We will give the money that you demand

1390
01:50:36,964 --> 01:50:39,205
I will give the money that you demand
-What ever you demand

1391
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:40,608
- Take as much you wish -You should
leave the town after receiving the money

1392
01:50:40,801 --> 01:50:41,802
Enjoy yourself!

1393
01:50:43,303 --> 01:50:45,783
My secretary had recorded
all your conversations

1394
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:47,619
For the sake of money...

1395
01:50:47,741 --> 01:50:51,120
...You listened to her and
ready to pour acid on my face

1396
01:50:52,179 --> 01:50:53,283
Take the blank Exchequer

1397
01:50:53,447 --> 01:50:54,619
Fill the number you desire

1398
01:50:55,649 --> 01:50:58,960
You should do what I may say, will you?
- What should I do?

1399
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:03,801
Both Marimuth and her son...

1400
01:51:04,157 --> 01:51:05,465
"should be chopped off

1401
01:51:10,163 --> 01:51:12,473
Oh gosh!

1402
01:51:18,172 --> 01:51:22,643
- What have you done?
- Don't sympathize with him

1403
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:24,990
I've recorded this cassette not him

1404
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:27,655
I've recorded and send it to you

1405
01:51:27,781 --> 01:51:30,819
- You mean -He is responsible
for me to aspire for you

1406
01:51:31,485 --> 01:51:34,989
After knowing about me,
he provoked me against you

1407
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:36,827
He took me to the five star hotel

1408
01:51:37,024 --> 01:51:40,130
There he showed me all your
propenies, belongings and buildings

1409
01:51:40,294 --> 01:51:44,003
He insulted me through yourself
Then only I aspired for you

1410
01:51:44,198 --> 01:51:45,677
Then only I used him

1411
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:48,210
I made a plan to
catch you by using him

1412
01:51:48,536 --> 01:51:51,517
To intimidate you
by a villain to marry her son...

1413
01:51:51,705 --> 01:51:55,175
.and pour acid on your face if not budge
so that you can marry him..

1414
01:51:55,276 --> 01:51:59,019
...lt was my plan and prompted your
secretary to tell all these to Marimuthu

1415
01:51:59,379 --> 01:52:01,359
Then Marimuthu invited me...

1416
01:52:01,548 --> 01:52:04,188
...and booked me as if it was her plan

1417
01:52:04,384 --> 01:52:06,523
If I make you know all these...

1418
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:09,701
...l was sure that you would come to me

1419
01:52:09,890 --> 01:52:11,528
Everything has passed as I wished

1420
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:16,033
He supported you,
then why did you kill him?

1421
01:52:16,163 --> 01:52:21,044
He cheated you without the gratitude
He may do the same for me

1422
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:24,909
He did all this to win
over you at the end

1423
01:52:26,206 --> 01:52:28,550
Till now you played
with the rowdies

1424
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:29,720
Now I will play

1425
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:32,216
From now on you can't
go anywhere, tie her

1426
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:34,388
Tie quickly

1427
01:52:40,754 --> 01:52:42,893
Where will you go now?
Where will you run?

1428
01:52:43,757 --> 01:52:45,600
You can't go anywhere from now

1429
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:50,230
Oh!, Will the tears
come in your eyes too?

1430
01:52:50,431 --> 01:52:53,275
Tears in your eyes!
Are you acting so that I can release you?

1431
01:52:53,434 --> 01:52:55,607
Yes, I am acting

1432
01:52:56,103 --> 01:52:58,583
lam living while acting life long

1433
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:02,614
What should I do?
I am an orphan

1434
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:05,279
Without mother and father

1435
01:53:06,446 --> 01:53:08,289
What is use in having cores of rupees

1436
01:53:08,615 --> 01:53:10,754
It has become my enemy

1437
01:53:12,987 --> 01:53:15,934
To save myself
I had kept Marimuthu with me...

1438
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:18,292
...And prevented everyone from me

1439
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:19,930
Everyone...

1440
01:53:21,128 --> 01:53:26,942
Men aspire for me
only for my money

1441
01:53:27,635 --> 01:53:30,275
Why should I need them?
You tell me

1442
01:53:31,739 --> 01:53:34,618
Isn't you want to marry me
only for my property

1443
01:53:34,975 --> 01:53:36,977
Take that Exchequer book...
Decide it

1444
01:53:37,144 --> 01:53:39,784
Do you want me or the money?

1445
01:53:41,815 --> 01:53:43,123
Why are you thinking?

1446
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:46,631
Take that, For you money is
more important than me

1447
01:53:52,926 --> 01:53:55,463
Write, write how much you wish

1448
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:57,137
Write down

1449
01:55:02,996 --> 01:55:07,996
<i>k 1</i>

1450
01:55:31,258 --> 01:55:36,230
<i>A fantastic girl has come!
And said 'I am your friend!</i>

1451
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:41,402
<i>And said ok for everything!
I am exhausted and stunned!</i>

1452
01:55:43,037 --> 01:55:48,037
<i>k 1</i>

1453
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:35,984
<i>Look at the narrows of her body
Look at the ding dong style</i>

1454
01:56:41,328 --> 01:56:46,300
<i>Blinking with the brightness!
Dancing with jigging!</i>

1455
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,980
<i>Without support . . .
Without control...</i>

1456
01:56:49,169 --> 01:56:51,547
<i>For that roaming horse
I will be the jockey</i>

1457

<i>Look at her bow like eyebrows!

01:57:57,871 --> 01:58:02,877
<i>Glittering with shine!
Shaking with jigging!</i>

1460
01:58:03,077 --> 01:58:05,387
<i>With salt over there!
And gruel over there!</i>

1461
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:07,957
<i>Look she has come like an arrogant hen!</i>

01:59:20,153 --> 01:59:21,461
- Open the door quickly

1466
01:59:22,823 --> 01:59:24,302
Come everybody

1467
01:59:24,491 --> 01:59:26,471
You cheat
You cheated me at last

1468
01:59:26,593 --> 01:59:29,631
I had told you I'll
kill you and myself

1469
01:59:29,829 --> 01:59:31,467
I will die

1470
01:59:31,598 --> 01:59:32,804
Leave me

1471
01:59:33,166 --> 01:59:37,478
- Leave me -Listen to me
-Leave me -Listen to me for a minute

1472
01:59:39,372 --> 01:59:42,819
- You shouldn't die
-Leave me

1473
01:59:51,184 --> 01:59:55,997
- Leave me
Leave me -Leave it

1474
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:02,833
Go and search him first

1475
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:08,509
Stay there, where are you going?

1476
02:00:09,202 --> 02:00:12,513
It's not easy to have this Keeflhi

1477
02:00:12,873 --> 02:00:15,854
- I had told you
-Listen to me

1478
02:00:16,042 --> 02:00:17,180
I know everything

1479
02:00:17,344 --> 02:00:19,517
I thought I was important
than both of them

1480
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:22,024
I thought you will
desert them for my sake

1481
02:00:22,382 --> 02:00:25,363
I used to play with men
who had small weaknesses

1482
02:00:25,485 --> 02:00:28,523
But you have the big weakness

1483
02:00:33,893 --> 02:00:34,871

1490
02:01:01,088 --> 02:01:04,069
Marimuthu's people
are coming to attack us

1491
02:01:04,191 --> 02:01:06,068

02:01:38,792 --> 02:01:41,102
Look our people are coming

1496
02:01:43,963 --> 02:01:47,274
Decide quickly whether
you need me or she or her

1497
02:01:48,301 --> 02:01:52,272
If you want your lover, discard both
of us and save her, decide quickly

1498
02:01:53,307 --> 02:01:54,285
She will die

1499
02:01:56,977 --> 02:01:58,615
Quick, what are you thinking?

1500
02:02:01,481 --> 02:02:03,791
Think it, she is dying

1501
02:02:04,984 --> 02:02:06,622
You have to discard us if you need her

1502
02:02:17,664 --> 02:02:18,506
<i>Go</i>

1503
02:02:18,832 --> 02:02:21,312
Now run away,
Let me see how you runaway

1504
02:02:21,835 --> 02:02:23,974
You have the habit of stripping

1505
02:02:24,671 --> 02:02:25,479
Run away

1506
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:27,985
Let me see how you runaway

1507
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,533
Take this You bold beauty, get up

02:03:24,998 --> 02:03:28,036
- Go from here, kill them all
-Catch them

1511
02:03:28,167 --> 02:03:30,204
- Go
-Don't let him escape

1512
02:05:14,507 --> 02:05:16,145
All threesome listen to me clearly

1513
02:05:16,309 --> 02:05:18,812
Hey beauty! What did you says?

1514
02:05:19,012 --> 02:05:21,515
A life with lies is real
and there is a joy in that myth

1515
02:05:22,015 --> 02:05:25,155
Didn't you say that? Then why
did you try to learn the truth?

1516
02:05:25,285 --> 02:05:28,323
It's true that I had
relationship with both of them

1517
02:05:28,521 --> 02:05:31,502
You must live with me
thinking it as a myth

1518
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:35,499
I will manage the secrecy about
my relationship with both of them

1519
02:05:36,529 --> 02:05:38,372
You must accept that and live with me

1520
02:05:39,532 --> 02:05:42,513
Isn't you are the girl
who cajole only to the real man?

1521
02:05:43,202 --> 02:05:45,409
Do you want to show my strength?

1522
02:05:45,538 --> 02:05:48,417
What will you do? Do you
want to kill me? Kill me

1523
02:05:48,642 --> 02:05:50,383
I won't live with you even ifl die

1524
02:05:51,211 --> 02:05:53,020
Nobody will come
with anybody after death

1525
02:05:53,213 --> 02:05:58,094
You threesome must come
with me if I were to live happily

1526
02:05:58,217 --> 02:06:02,063
You can't do anyihing by threatening
We're not in a position to agree with you

1527
02:06:02,656 --> 02:06:04,033
You must agree

1528
02:06:04,557 --> 02:06:06,901
Will I make you threesome agree?
Will I?

1529
02:06:07,093 --> 02:06:08,868
Make us agree
Let's see how you make us agree

1530
02:06:08,995 --> 02:06:10,872
You threesome wanted to die, right?

1531
02:06:11,898 --> 02:06:13,741
You have only two options

1532
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:17,211
Either you have to accept
and live with me or die

1533
02:06:17,403 --> 02:06:18,211
Tell me

1534
02:06:41,595 --> 02:06:44,098
You there! Aren't you Naanu?

1535
02:06:46,432 --> 02:06:48,912
I am Gopala

1536
02:06:49,102 --> 02:06:51,412
Remember me that time, there

1537
02:06:52,605 --> 02:06:53,743
- Radha -You are not
listening to me

1538
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:56,252
- I waited yesterday near your house
-Who asked to wait for me?

1539
02:06:59,946 --> 02:07:02,426
- Go away -Just a minute
Radha just a minute

1540
02:07:04,117 --> 02:07:06,427
- What sir?
-What are you doing?

1541
02:07:06,619 --> 02:07:08,758
- I am loving that girl
Love!- Yes

1542
02:07:08,888 --> 02:07:12,165
You stupid! If you wear this
slippers and roam with this rusted cycle...

1543
02:07:12,292 --> 02:07:15,933
...not only a year she won't
care you even if you roam for 100 years

1544
02:07:16,295 --> 02:07:18,832
Come forward in life, earn

1545
02:07:18,965 --> 02:07:21,275
Not hundreds like this girl
but thousands like her will follow you

1546
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:24,941
We should not go after
anyihing ever in our life

1547
02:07:25,738 --> 02:07:27,615
Everything should fall behind us

1548
02:07:27,773 --> 02:07:31,277
Have you understood?
This is Naanu's policy, go

1549
02:07:31,644 --> 02:07:33,783
Go, don't follow the
girl anymore? -Ok sir

1550
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:41,158
That Gopala who was
after that girl had died long ago

1551
02:07:41,321 --> 02:07:44,996
Today girls are after me
lam like a king now

1552
02:07:47,327 --> 02:07:50,797
Like you said
the desired things are behind me

1553
02:07:53,333 --> 02:07:54,971
What a great thing you had said!

1554
02:07:57,937 --> 02:08:01,475
I worked hard since then

1555
02:08:01,607 --> 02:08:04,645
Monthly I am earning
60 to 70 thousand. I am happy

1556
02:08:11,184 --> 02:08:14,165
I thought it's a good place to enjoy
But didn't know that you were here

1557
02:08:14,353 --> 02:08:15,661
I will take leave

1558
02:08:17,523 --> 02:08:18,661
Why are you so dull?

1559
02:08:18,791 --> 02:08:21,328
One shouldn't be dull in the life,
Life will be lost if we remain dull

1560
02:08:21,461 --> 02:08:23,998
Take this, enjoy

1561
02:08:24,364 --> 02:08:28,835
Drink it, it's your brand
You are so changed now

1562
02:08:32,038 --> 02:08:35,349
It's your style filter beedi, take it
Heaven is just close

1563
02:08:35,441 --> 02:08:37,011
Have it, puff it

1564
02:08:37,143 --> 02:08:40,022
This is your real get up

1565
02:08:44,884 --> 02:08:48,195
Like you said we live
only for 2 to 3 thousand days

1566
02:08:48,321 --> 02:08:49,527
Then why should we get tense?

1567
02:08:50,390 --> 02:08:54,031
Enjoy, you too enjoy,
what is there in the life?

1568
02:09:11,077 --> 02:09:13,580
You bitch! You dirty fellows!

1569
02:09:13,746 --> 02:09:15,054
Where have you all gone?

1570
02:09:16,549 --> 02:09:21,055
Suma, Ragini, Sandhya
I will hit you with slippers

1571
02:09:22,422 --> 02:09:24,732
Scoundrels! Everybody has left me

1572
02:09:33,099 --> 02:09:35,739
Not enough for them and the house

1573
02:09:37,603 --> 02:09:40,413
You bitch! You dirty fellows!

1574
02:10:32,358 --> 02:10:35,464
Oh king! Tell me
what the Naanu will do now?

1575
02:10:35,662 --> 02:10:39,132
Will that girls kill him?
Will he go deserting them?

1576
02:10:39,332 --> 02:10:41,334
Or will he get any one
of the threesome?

1577
02:10:41,667 --> 02:10:45,137
Tell me the ending of this story
if you have the guts, tell me

1578
02:10:51,044 --> 02:10:52,022
Hey ghost!

1579
02:10:52,679 --> 02:10:55,819
The three girls in the story
that you had told me till now...

1580
02:10:56,015 --> 02:10:59,986
...are not the girls at all
-What do you mean?

1581
02:11:00,186 --> 02:11:02,826
That Naanu is not the
name of a single person

1582
02:11:03,022 --> 02:11:08,165
That is the reflection of
feelings of Naanu(Me) in everyone

1583
02:11:08,627 --> 02:11:13,167
Those three girls are like
the three seasons in everyone's life

1584
02:11:13,533 --> 02:11:16,343
Like the summer, winter and monsoon

1585
02:11:16,536 --> 02:11:18,846
In every Naanu's(Me) life...

1586
02:11:19,205 --> 02:11:20,343
There are some responsibilities...

1587
02:11:20,473 --> 02:11:21,679
Some happiness.

1588
02:11:21,874 --> 02:11:24,047
Some ambitions will be there

1589
02:11:24,210 --> 02:11:25,848
For a common man...

1590
02:11:26,012 --> 02:11:27,855
...or for a rich man...

1591
02:11:28,214 --> 02:11:32,526
One house for him
Father and mother, wife children..

1592
02:11:32,886 --> 02:11:35,196
...like this some responsibility
will be there

1593
02:11:35,554 --> 02:11:38,694
That is like the wives in your story

1594
02:11:39,058 --> 02:11:41,868
Everyone in his life...

1595
02:11:42,061 --> 02:11:46,373
find fun and happiness in something

1596
02:11:46,566 --> 02:11:48,409
That is Rathi

1597
02:11:49,168 --> 02:11:53,708
To quench these two he has to earn one

1598
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:57,221
That is money,
Keeflhi, the Success

1599
02:11:57,910 --> 02:12:01,414
The name of these
feelings is the girl Keerthi

1600
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:07,223
The Naanu(Me) in everyone
struggles in these three feelings

1601
02:12:07,453 --> 02:12:11,731
Then what is the end for this story
which has the feelings as the characters?

1602
02:12:12,091 --> 02:12:16,403
What is the solution for this
Naanu(Me) problem in everyone?

1603
02:12:18,597 --> 02:12:20,736
That Naanu(Me) should die

1604
02:12:22,101 --> 02:12:23,739
Should be born again after the death

1605
02:12:25,405 --> 02:12:29,581
You dilly fellow! You loafer!
You worst fellow!

1606
02:12:30,276 --> 02:12:32,586
Don't you feel ashamed?

1607
02:12:33,112 --> 02:12:35,786
You preach everyone
in the town but don't follow

1608
02:12:36,115 --> 02:12:38,755
See your face, you dirty fellow!

1609
02:12:38,951 --> 02:12:41,261
You look like a Devil, a Monster

1610
02:12:44,223 --> 02:12:46,430
Naanu(Me), His name itself is Naanu

1611
02:12:46,626 --> 02:12:48,435
He wears the
picture of his own on his shirt

1612
02:12:48,795 --> 02:12:50,934
As if he is an 'He-man'

1613
02:12:53,799 --> 02:12:55,142
What happiness did you get?

1614
02:12:55,468 --> 02:12:57,607
What happiness did you
get from those threesome?

1615
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:04,280
Me, My wife, My things

1616
02:13:04,477 --> 02:13:08,823
My money, My property
and wail for the humility

1617
02:13:12,819 --> 02:13:16,494
Suppose a Crore rupee is stolen
or robbed in the neighbour's house"

1618
02:13:16,656 --> 02:13:17,828
...You won't feel sad

1619
02:13:18,157 --> 02:13:22,128
But if a 500 or a thousand
rupees is stolen in your house"

1620
02:13:22,495 --> 02:13:24,304
...You will feel very distressed

1621
02:13:24,497 --> 02:13:26,135
Do you know why?

1622
02:13:26,332 --> 02:13:29,142
Because you feel
it was 'mine', that's the reason

1623
02:13:29,335 --> 02:13:31,645
Don't feel distressed
by feeling it as yours

1624
02:13:31,837 --> 02:13:35,649
Just for a second consider it as
not yours, you will be happy

1625
02:13:38,811 --> 02:13:41,655
Yes men can't live without
denouncing the 'me' and 'mine' in them

1626
02:13:41,814 --> 02:13:44,192
But if you give up 10 percent...

1627
02:13:44,350 --> 02:13:46,830
...You can live psychologically
happy for at least 20 percent

1628
02:13:47,019 --> 02:13:50,990
If you give up 20 percent of 'Me'
You can live happily for 50 percent

1629
02:13:54,126 --> 02:13:56,003
It's impossible

1630
02:13:56,362 --> 02:13:57,841
It's impossible to give up 'me' and 'mine'

1631
02:13:58,130 --> 02:14:01,339
Why not possible?
You can if you intend

1632
02:14:01,467 --> 02:14:04,505
It is possible if you intend
Tear off the 'me' and 'mine' in you

1633
02:14:04,871 --> 02:14:08,182
Tear it off
Tear off the 'me' and 'mine' in you

1634
02:14:08,374 --> 02:14:09,853
Tear it off

1635
02:14:13,713 --> 02:14:15,192
Break and throw off the 'me' in you

1636
02:14:15,381 --> 02:14:17,190
Let the Naanu(Me) die
