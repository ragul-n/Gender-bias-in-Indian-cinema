Where is your family then?

00:01:29,816 --> 00:01:32,384
- Back in India.

00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,725
Don't you worry, my dear.

11
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:45,462
I know what it's like to be
in your shoes, starting over.

00:01:45,464 --> 00:01:47,934
I left everybody behind,
just like you.

Maybe one day you'll be
running this place, huh?

00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:45,823
There used to be a pool,
we had to take it out.

Hey, kids,
is this your pizza box here?

34
00:03:05,577 --> 00:03:07,713
You gotta pick that up.
That doesn't look so good, huh?

35
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:13,083
I let them stay here.

36
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:15,920

00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:56,667
I saw what you did, stealing.

185
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:58,971
Opening suitcases,
God knows what else.

186
00:17:59,806 --> 00:18:01,406
You're sneaky, Riz.

187
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,342
Look, Jimmy and I,
we got a plan.

188
00:18:06,344 --> 00:18:07,845
Okay, we score extra dough
on the side.

189
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:10,582
- Odd jobs, simple, easy stuff.
- Like drugs?

190
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:17,587
We're gonna hold up
that bitch Una.

191
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:19,355
I'm not doing anything criminal.

192
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:20,760
Are you calling me a criminal?

193
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:25,330
I need to use the washroom.

194
00:18:28,835 --> 00:18:31,003
Doreen!

195
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:36,709
Thank you.

196
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:28,759
Try the cream on top.
Try the top.

197
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:30,995
- Yeah.
- Try the top, yeah.

198
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:32,765
It's my favorite bit.

199
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:36,401
It's nice.

200
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,504
Fuck, yeah.

201
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:49,046
I'm vomiting and I'm like,
yakking up these mushrooms.

202
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:52,016
But then in the vomit
I could see maggots.

203
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:55,485
So I'm like, "Do I vomit,
do I not?" It was pretty scary.

204
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,889
[muffled music plays]

205
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:05,330
[chattering]

206
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:14,941
[muffled] Wanna lie down?

207
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,877
You okay, honey?

208
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:21,681
I feel great.

209
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:28,654
[music fades]

210
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:50,776
[no dialogue]

211
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:57,549
Oh, fuck the birds.

212
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:09,226
So you're wearing
nail polish now?

213
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:12,129
Huh? Oh, this?

214
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:14,064
What's that, gel?

215
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,633
I don't know. Is that the shit
that doesn't come off?

216
00:21:15,635 --> 00:21:17,770
Let me see. It's gel.

217
00:21:21,107 --> 00:21:23,908
Speak of the devil.

218
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,745
Peaches, this is the diva
behind the nails.

219
00:21:32,617 --> 00:21:34,586
- Classy gel work.
- Thanks, ladybug.

220
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:38,923
I have something
so hot for you, baby

221
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:40,126
so hot, I am burning all over.

222
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:45,062
Well, I'll leave y'all two
to y'all business.

223
00:21:45,064 --> 00:21:46,732
Bye, Peaches.

224
00:21:49,936 --> 00:21:51,938
Well, what you got?

225
00:21:53,806 --> 00:21:55,207
This.

226
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:59,910
Wowza! Where the fuck
did you get that?

227
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:01,812
Don't you worry your
pretty little head about it.

228
00:22:01,814 --> 00:22:03,280
That's gotta be fucking...

229
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:04,350
What are you gonna get me
for it?

230
00:22:06,218 --> 00:22:08,686
I mean, college kids will pay,
like, 800 for that shit.

231
00:22:08,688 --> 00:22:10,823
1.5K or I sell it here.

232
00:22:12,091 --> 00:22:13,991
If you try and sell it here

233
00:22:13,993 --> 00:22:15,558
whoever you stole it from
is gonna find out.

234
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,029
Get real grumpy about it.

235
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:20,132
1K.

236
00:22:23,903 --> 00:22:25,769
All right, we have a deal

237
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:28,706
but you gotta do
this extra thing for me first

238
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,140
in the school.

239
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:32,910
- Is it gonna make me money?
- Mm-hmm.

240
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:34,714
You know what that makes me
for Halloween?

241
00:22:37,817 --> 00:22:39,617
Hot and horny?

242
00:22:42,855 --> 00:22:45,257

[groans]

244
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,875
Come on, mate.

245
00:23:04,877 --> 00:23:07,978
- [both groan]
- [cell phone rings]

246
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,180
Don't you dare
fucking answer it.

247
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:12,251
- What if it's Pink?
- God, fuck Pink.

248
00:23:13,886 --> 00:23:17,721
- The fuck nugget, Jimmy.
- Shut up!

249
00:23:17,723 --> 00:23:21,058
Uh, yeah. What, delivery?

250
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,162
Okay, yeah,
I'll be there in a wink.

251
00:23:25,031 --> 00:23:26,766
Real fucking nice.

252
00:23:29,835 --> 00:23:33,005
What? Do you wanna sell
the rock or not? He's the guy.

253
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:37,908
Look, we got time for a quickie.

254
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,811
Kiss my grits, Jimmy.

255
00:23:40,813 --> 00:23:42,146
You ever heard
of seize the moment?

256
00:23:42,148 --> 00:23:43,947
It's gone now
and you didn't seize it.

257
00:23:43,949 --> 00:23:46,185
Yeah, well, I'll fucking
seize it next time, all right.

258
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:51,957
Get out.

259
00:23:53,793 --> 00:23:55,161
Get out.

260
00:23:58,697 --> 00:24:00,066
[scoffs]

261
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,581
[dance music blares]

262
00:24:44,877 --> 00:24:47,012
Dallas?

263
00:24:54,253 --> 00:24:55,888
Get the fuck off of her!

264
00:24:58,124 --> 00:24:59,624
Up.

265
00:25:12,705 --> 00:25:16,073
Well, you saved me
from the big rabbit.

266
00:25:16,075 --> 00:25:17,774
Drink.

267
00:25:17,776 --> 00:25:19,278
Drink.

268
00:25:23,215 --> 00:25:24,884
How did you get those scars?

269
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:33,159
Did you do that to yourself?

270
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:49,141
It started
with robbing tourists.

271
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:56,916
Then, car parts.

272
00:25:59,952 --> 00:26:02,154
Then cash machines.

273
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:13,299
We were a gang of six.

274
00:26:15,234 --> 00:26:17,236
All different.

275
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,307
Like, in a family.

276
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:26,143
And what'd you do
with the money?

277
00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:29,446
Paid the smugglers
to bring me here.

278
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:31,784
It was the only way.

279
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:38,290
- And trucks.
- Trucks?

280
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:45,262
I was in charge
of getting the trucks to stop

281
00:26:45,264 --> 00:26:46,398
so that we could rob them.

282
00:26:49,835 --> 00:26:51,770
I...

283
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:57,810
I hopped in
to this old man's truck.

284
00:26:59,144 --> 00:27:00,379
And...

285
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:03,282
we drove for a bit.

286
00:27:07,553 --> 00:27:11,357
Then, he suddenly stopped
in the middle of nowhere.

287
00:27:12,524 --> 00:27:14,293
And he jumped on me.

288
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:22,935
I took care of it.

289
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:26,105
How?

290
00:27:32,077 --> 00:27:33,512
[sighs]

291
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:38,450
Lie on me.

292
00:27:50,162 --> 00:27:51,930
Okay.

293
00:27:53,432 --> 00:27:55,134
Closer.

294
00:28:03,942 --> 00:28:05,477
Kiss my neck.

295
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,428
Then he pulled down his pants.

00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:35,274

will govern our land.

America first!

- Excuse me, ma'am.
- What?

303
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:41,138
Did you find out
about my passport?

We must protect our borders
from the ravages...

[hip hop music plays]

309
00:29:59,726 --> 00:30:01,326
Shut up.

310
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,339
Empty the safe and hand it over,
you karaoke bitch

311
00:30:16,341 --> 00:30:18,108
or I will stuff this into
every fucking hole in your body

312
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,378
and pull the goddamn trigger.

313
00:30:22,414 --> 00:30:26,082
Get on the bed. On the bed.

314
00:30:26,084 --> 00:30:27,484
Take your clothes off.

315
00:30:27,486 --> 00:30:29,219
You're a fucking hot mess,
you know that?

316
00:30:29,221 --> 00:30:30,589
Shut up!

317
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:44,735
Please, I don't have anything.
All the money is in...

318
00:30:44,737 --> 00:30:47,638
Shut up!

319
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,173
Stop lying or I'll blow
your fucking ear off.

320
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:53,210
You ever seen anybody
without an ear?

321
00:30:53,212 --> 00:30:54,244
Looks like they got a black hole
on the side of their head

322
00:30:54,246 --> 00:30:56,181
and it's fucking gross.

323
00:30:57,349 --> 00:30:59,082
[laughs] Thank God.

324
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:00,450
How was that?

325
00:31:00,452 --> 00:31:03,455
That was sexy.

326
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:06,757
The tits were a nice touch.

327
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:11,595
I'm ready for some R&R, Jimmy.
Ruthless revenge.

328
00:31:11,597 --> 00:31:13,332
That bitch is not gonna know
what hit her.

329
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:16,401
Are those mine?

- [Dallas] Stop it.

[indistinct chatter]

333
00:31:32,785 --> 00:31:34,687
You're gonna give yourself
a heart attack, you know?

[TV chatter continues]

335
00:31:51,704 --> 00:31:53,438
Uh, hello?

336
00:31:55,507 --> 00:31:57,607
It's gonna be so easy, in
and out and we split it 50-50-

337
00:31:57,609 --> 00:31:59,409
She is one moody fuck.

338
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:02,647
Hey, Dallas, you in or not?

339
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:06,651
I don't know, Jimmy. It all
seems a bit sketchy for me.

340
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:09,586
Listen, I'm going out
on a limb here for you

341
00:32:09,588 --> 00:32:10,888
robbing my own flesh and blood.
What are you doing for me?

342
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:13,559
Jeez. All right.

343
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:18,463
Hey.

344
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:25,203
Thank you.

345
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,274
Dallas!

346
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,710
- What?
- What's that?

347
00:32:32,712 --> 00:32:35,278
- It's Doreen.
- Doreen?

348
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,747
Yeah, Doreen.
Jimmy gave her to me.

349
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:38,450
I hate rats.

350
00:32:42,521 --> 00:32:44,487
You don't really like Jimmy
at all, do you?

351
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:45,825
I don't know him.

352
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:48,661
You're just jealous.

353
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:51,563
Shut up!

[scoff, chuckles]

355
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:01,708
I'm just fucking with you.
I have a job for you.

356
00:33:10,582 --> 00:33:12,449
- What's this?
- What we're getting.

357
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:14,952
- Where?
- School.

358
00:33:14,954 --> 00:33:16,787
- I'm not doing it.
- Okay.

359
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:18,523
How do you think we're gonna
get out of here then, Riz?

360
00:33:20,627 --> 00:33:23,493
Folding bed sheets?
Wiping people's shit?

00:33:23,495 --> 00:33:25,896
Okay, this is America.
You want the...

Hey, you want the rainbow,
