1
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,800
(distant traffic cacophony)

2
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,000
(song on stereo)

3
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,760
I watch mesmerized, all day

4
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,760
(song muffles)

5
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,260
(old Bengali song plays on phone)

6
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,060
(sound muffles)

7
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,500
(phone rings)

8
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
Hello?

9
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,020
Hello…

10
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,990
Hello…

11
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,060
(mechanical buzz)

12
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,630
(mumbles)

13
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,330
(speaks gibberish)

14
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,430
(evil gibberish)

15
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,030
(Sanskrit)
Om Hring Fath!

16
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,630
Om Hring Fath!

17
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,130
(chants Sanskrit verses)

18
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,400
(thud on metal)

19
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,500
(fires gun)

20
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,130
(ominous music)

21
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,530
It's a simple job.

22
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,360
You've to follow my wife 24 X 7.

23
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,890
You see, uh…

24
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,230
I've been suspecting that…
she is having an affair.

25
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,330
Don't worry about the fees.
I just want the truth.

26
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,960
And in case my suspicions are correct,

27
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,700
I need you to get me some photos.

28
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,420
I mean… some proof.

29
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,600
Don't worry.

30
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,480
Extramaritals are my specialty.

31
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,940
(whips)

32
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,280
(door slams)

33
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,650
Who is it!

34
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,630
You? Who are you…
What are you doing here?

35
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,510
What else, I was recording
a video of your activities.

36
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,100
A video? Why are you quiet?

37
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,830
Say something!
-(man mumbles)

38
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,890
This is not fair.

39
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,300
Hello baby… what's wrong with you?

40
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,170
What is it?

41
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,930
Bugger, you don't know me!
I'll put you behind bars!

42
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,830
Do you know my father?
-Uh-huh.

43
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,400
Son of a gun, son of a gun!

44
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,180
Here's your cream roll!

45
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,660
Gag yourself nicely…
with your own thing.

46
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,170
(throws a kiss)

47
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,890
My job's done. I've to handover
the video to your husband, Soumen.

48
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,900
Soumen! Uh…

49
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,290
Please!

50
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,730
What did Soumen tell you?
-I am… 'K'. Private detective.

51
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,610
Look Mr. K, Soumen is my husband.

52
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,100
He's physically… how do I explain this...

53
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,500
Uh… can't we sort this out between us?

54
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,230
Hey, what's going on!

55
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,430
Shut up.

56
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,250
Hey, not a good time.

57
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,320
You see I have…

58
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,840
professional ethics.

59
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,780
Look, your husband, Soumen…
paid me 25,000 rupees.

60
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,230
And honestly, I'll spent it all. Hmm!

61
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,460
Soumen paid you 25,000 rupees?

62
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,760
Yes.

63
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,330
What if I… pay you 50,000?

64
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,200
No, it's not done. It's not…

65
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,640
...done. Okay. Done…

66
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,860
Done.

67
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,650
Please.

68
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,390
(whispers) What a woman you are!

69
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,740
Bingo!
-Why are you late?

70
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,960
With good reason. Where's the DVD
of the video I sent you?

71
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,810
It's ready.

72
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,510
Thank you, thank you.

73
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,830
(presses key)

74
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,500
Two.

75
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,820
Two, Gopal da?

76
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,790
Is that fair? It's HD quality.
Even the body hair is clear.

77
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:29,360
I took a life-risk. Just two?
-Can't see her face, bro. She's masked.

78
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,950
So what?
The rest of her assets are quite visible.

79
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,070
Please increase the pay.
-Clients don't pay without a pretty face.

80
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,460
Bro, you don't get it.
The mask is like 'fill in the blanks'.

81
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,000
Heroines of all sorts--
-No no!

82
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,430
The neighbor, the crush…
they can imagine their own choices.

83
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,710
Right? Please increase the money.

84
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,520
Indian porn after all.
Give me 4000, please.

85
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,040
Shopkeeper: Not happening.

86
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,160
3,500?
-Three!

87
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,840
Three…
-Hmm.

88
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,240
Three.

89
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,820
Okay.

90
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:12,100
24,500… Another fifty
from what the lady paid.

91
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,800
So, 25,000 in total.

92
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,200
I've been thinking...

93
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,950
You see, my hand shakes
when I shoot on phone.

94
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,590
I end up missing some body part
or the other.

95
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,500
Can't we arrange for a camera.
Something that clicks stills…

96
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,220
But has a video recording option too.

97
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,800
Yet no one should know I'm carrying it.

98
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,390
Spects plus camera. Ta-da!

99
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,930
20 megapixels. Full HD.

100
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,530
It's got a button. Clicks pictures.

101
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,260
Wonderful.

102
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,030
Not one will ever suspect.

103
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,510
You should get a Nobel prize!
Nobel Nobel Nobel Nobel!

104
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,860
I bought it for 5000 rupees. Online.
Okay?

105
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,120
Don't be mean now.
I put out an ad in the paper.

106
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,920
If I get a good client… I'll pay you.

107
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,400
You already owe me a lot, okay?
You never pay me back…

108
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,880
Excuse me.
Is this Secret Eye Detective Agency?

109
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,660
K: Um… yes, please come.

110
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Client!

111
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,180
Tell me. I am K (who).

112
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,710
Who are you?

113
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,850
I mean, I am 'K'.

114
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,500
How would I know?

115
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,540
Not like that.

116
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,560
He is 'K'. Krishnodas. K.

117
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,700
And he's Harami. An ass.

118
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,240
Ah…
-Anyway, please tell us.

119
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,160
I am Nilanjana Sen.

120
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,600
I live in Asansol.

121
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,530
I was raised by my mum.

122
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,130
I studied Chemistry
in Asansol Women's College.

123
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,690
My parents were separated years ago.

124
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,230
Since then…

125
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,640
we're not in touch with dad.

126
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,530
But on the 14th of last month…

127
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,270
my mother passed away.

128
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,530
Lung cancer.

129
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,540
Oh, sorry.

130
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,900
My father's name is Aniket Sen.

131
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,800
I must inform him of the news.

132
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,230
But I don't have his contact info.

133
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,830
What does your father do?

134
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,510
He was a professor of Psychology
at Delhi University's North Campus.

135
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,030
Okay… you said your dad lived in Delhi.

136
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,240
What are you doing in Kolkata?
-Yes, I was about to tell you.

137
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,390
About a week ago
a distant uncle of mine…

138
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,430
He saw my dad at Ultodanga station.

139
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,430
He clicked a picture of him as well.

140
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,610
Show me.
-On platform number three.

141
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,820
I called at the college
where dad used to teach.

142
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,110
They said… my dad put in
his resignation five years ago.

143
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,580
So… now this picture is all I have.

144
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,700
I never had anyone but my mom. (weeps)

145
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,660
So I came to you.

146
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,500
I saw your ad in the paper.
-Uh, keep this.

147
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
Don't worry. We'll find your dad.

148
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:20,480
Don't cry. Does he have any habits
or hobbies… anything?

149
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,900
Yes… hobbies…

150
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,820
He loved dogs.

151
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,790
I mean, when we lived in Delhi,
dad had a pet.

152
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,390
Don't worry, do one thing…

153
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,110
Your dad's photo…

154
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,360
Text it to me.

155
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,000
My number is--

156
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,180
Harami: 8017659545.

157
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,520
Your fees…

158
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,360
Ten thousand.
-(coughs)

159
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:59,330
With the tax, food allowance
and lodging; it will come to 14,000.

160
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,700
(coughs)
-5000 in advance please.

161
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,220
(whispers) Okay?
-Cool.

162
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,450
Don't worry. Don't cry. I will surely…

163
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,460
find your dad.

164
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,370
Address?
-El Dorado guest house in Gariahat area.

165
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,700
I'm there for five days.

166
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,240
(camera clicks)
-If you can find my dad by then…

167
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,500
it'll be great. If you find his address,
don't tell him anything.

168
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,670
You see…
we've not been in touch for years.

169
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,600
Putting a mole after him…
it may look weird, you see.

170
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,520
Hmm. I get it. (clicks)

171
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,570
Sure, I'll call you. Don't worry.

172
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,170
See you.
-Okay.

173
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,250
Bye.

174
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
K: Hmm.

175
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,450
You parents gave you
such a nice name, Krishnodas.

176
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,220
What the hell is 'K'!

177
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,990
Shut up. Don't be nonsensical.

178
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,540
Krishnodas. What kind of a name is that?

179
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,560
Sounds like the name of a folk singer.

180
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,470
K sounds interesting.

181
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,940
It's got a mystery to it. K (who)!
-Who, when, where!

182
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,120
Shut up.

183
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,230
She is your sister in law.
-Huh?

184
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,690
Time to find my father in law.

185
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,570
(puffs)

186
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,200
I did an image search on him.

187
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,250
Uh-huh. No info.

188
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,300
Ultadanga station. Platform number three.

189
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,580
Send Aniket Sen's photo
to all our informers in the city.

190
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,030
(traffic cacophony)

191
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,080
And the daily passengers
and hawkers at that station…

192
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,860
We've to interrogate them,
showing them the photo.

193
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,560
(suspenseful music)

194
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,390
How much?
-Ten rupees.

195
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,520
Make one.

196
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,100
You work on the Sealdah line?
-Yes, I board from Ultadanga station.

197
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,340
Ah.

198
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,710
Do you know this man?
Travels from here daily, seen him?

199
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,520
Yes, I know him.
-Great. Take a good look.

200
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,800
He buys from me.
-Ah.

201
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,630
I know him, hence I asked.
-Okay.

202
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,790
Put some lemon.
-Okay.

203
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,600
Uh… where does he get off?

204
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,960
Sealdah station.
-Okay.

205
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,510
Sealdah station...

206
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,550
Snacks…

207
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,700
He lives in Sealdah area.

208
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,520
Sealdah?

209
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,410
That's just a tiny locality.

210
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,830
Know the population of Sealdah?
-Why, do you want to count it?

211
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,270
Look at the photo.
See what he's carrying.

212
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,590
Zoom in! Zoom in!

213
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,990
Pedigree…

214
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,690
Dog food.

215
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,000
Like she said…

216
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,260
I am Aniket Sen.

217
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,030
I love dogs.

218
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,830
I buy Pedigree food.
People don't buy it for Indian dogs.

219
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,520
So, an imported breed of dog.

220
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,230
And in order to maintain that dog,
he surely needs medication.

221
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,710
But if he went out of town,
he'd leave his dog behind.

222
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,070
Dog creches, care centers
and stuff like that.

223
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,000
Look it up.

224
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,450
No pet boarding centers at Sealdah.

225
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,480
The nearest one is at Moulali area.

226
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,330
And… there are only two vets in Sealdah.

227
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,200
Hello.

228
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,210
Piku Babu, right?

229
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,460
Yes.

230
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,520
I've heard a lot
about your pet care center.

231
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,800
Okay.

232
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,840
A relative of mine comes here often.

233
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,460
See if you can recognize him...

234
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,470
He has a doggy.

235
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,780
It's difficult to tell
unless he's a regular customer.

236
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,970
You have his dog's photo?

237
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,050
Like a portfolio of the dog?
-Uh... yes.

238
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,660
Uh...

239
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,750
Should I get it done by Daboo Ratnani?

240
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,480
What!
-Yes, he looks familiar.

241
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,240
He has a Labrador, right?
He comes here frequently.

242
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,340
Yes, a Labrador.

243
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,530
Look…

244
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,360
Can you give me his number or address?

245
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,780
I don't keep such records.

246
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,260
But…

247
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,460
I guess he lives nearby.

248
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,360
He never comes dressed to go out.

249
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,230
That day he went home in a rickshaw.

250
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,710
Okay.

251
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,880
(suspenseful music)

252
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,390
Brother.
-Yes?

253
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,380
Have a look at this gentleman,
does he live here?

254
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,350
Yes, he lives close by.
New in the neighborhood.

255
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,960
Is that so…

256
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,960
Which house?

257
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,200
I have no idea.
He comes here to have tea sometimes.

258
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,710
Okay.

259
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,900
Two cups of tea, please.

260
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,620
Why don't we ask each of the houses here?

261
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:20,030
Want to ask everyone?
People will beat you up, you fool!

262
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,380
No, we can approach
each of the houses separately.

263
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,800
Then get beaten up by each of them.

264
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,230
Shut up!

265
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,160
(mysterious music)

266
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,210
Look.

267
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
(clicks)

268
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,090
K: Let's follow him.

269
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,150
Okay. But why did you get so serious
about this case?

270
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,790
I have reasons.
-What reason? The girl?

271
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
K: Shut up.

272
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,980
This case is different from the others.

273
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,000
Come!

274
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,420
What's your uncle's name?
-Huh… Bim-Bimal.

275
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,060
No, Aniket is your uncle now.

276
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,340
Call him out.
-Aniket uncle…

277
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,730
Love you. Now we're sure he is Aniket.

278
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,020
Sorry to make you wait.
-No, it's fine.

279
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,600
Your dad's address.

280
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,310
How do I say thanks to you…
-Why, just say it.

281
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,000
I never thought you'd find him so soon.

282
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,570
The rest of your fee. Please count it.

283
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,750
It's okay.

284
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,300
Err...

285
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,260
How long are you here?

286
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,760
If I meet him today…

287
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,380
I'll return by day after. Why?

288
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,300
No reason. Just asking.

289
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:49,330
You know what, let me know if you
lose another relative. We'll meet again.

290
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,190
No, the case is critical.
Don't worry, I'll manage.

291
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,010
Listen…
-Yes… okay, Sir.

292
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,290
No, Sir. I'll come.

293
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,220
Yes, Sir. Take my regards.

294
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,780
Can I hang up now?

295
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,600
Okay.

296
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,720
Who were you talking to?
-My maths teacher.

297
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,930
You have exams coming up?

298
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,200
Trying to fool me…

299
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,120
Are you having an affair?

300
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,280
Uh-huh.
-Stop grinning.

301
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,480
(phone rings)

302
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,270
I know you well.

303
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,070
Hello.
-Found the guy.

304
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,360
Shut up.

305
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,100
The job's already done.
I found him before you.

306
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,840
You're useless.
-He's dead. Committed suicide.

307
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,760
(disconnects)
-What… Hello? Hello…

308
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,600
Aniket Sen.

309
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,360
Nilanjana's father.
-Hmm.

310
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,080
Killed himself.
-Oh no… now?

311
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,760
I should call Nilanjana.

312
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,600
Nilanjana.

313
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,980
(recorded voice) The number you have--
-Damn it!

314
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,060
Not reachable.

315
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,960
What to do?

316
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,710
Come!

317
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,530
(mysterious music)

318
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,740
(ambulance siren) (dog barks in distance)

319
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,980
(crowd murmur)

320
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,700
Hurry up, guys.

321
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,620
Check Sunil babu's room. Go.

322
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,780
See if you find anything
apart from the dog.

323
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,000
Excuse me, Sir.

324
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,430
Yes?

325
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,190
I want to talk about the suicide--
-Are you a relative or a neighbor?

326
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,010
No… Aniket Babu's daughter
is my client--

327
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,130
-Who is Aniket?

328
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,770
The man who committed suicide.
-He's Sunil Mukherjee.

329
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,490
You're making a mistake.
He is Aniket Sen. He was--

330
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,370
-Nonsense. His landlord said
he is Sunil Mukherjee. Wasting my time!

331
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,650
Hey, hurry up.

332
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,080
Landlord:
I'm sick of answering their questions!

333
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,250
I'm going nuts.
Answering the cops and a ton of others.

334
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,630
Why will I answer!
-Right.

335
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,220
It may be my house
but I'm not liable to explain.

336
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,580
True.
-Huh?

337
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,950
Aniket Babu… as in Sunil babu…

338
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,550
How long was he living here?
-I just told the cops everything.

339
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,710
Just to clear the confusion.
People are saying many things…

340
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,730
He shifted six months back.

341
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,200
I wouldn't have rented it out to him,
if I knew he'll kill himself.

342
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,570
Rubbish--
-Did his daughter come after he died?

343
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,040
His daughter?

344
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,100
He had nobody.
He used to live alone in the house.

345
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,520
No, I mean…
did a girl come to visit him recently?

346
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,760
He never had a daughter.
He lived alone with that dog.

347
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,190
This morning; the maid arrived.
She was ringing the doorbell.

348
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,590
The dog kept barking.
And no one was opening the door.

349
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,230
I got suspicious.

350
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,900
I had a spare key.
So, I got inside to find him…

351
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,730
Well, he had hung himself.

352
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,670
Bugger left a suicide note too.

353
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,780
Bull--
-What was written in it?

354
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,540
Very brief! “No one is responsible
for my death” Got it?

355
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,730
Shyamal da… wait a minute please.

356
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,340
Tell me something.
-Hmm?

357
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,440
Why did he kill himself?

358
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,130
It's a murder.

359
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,410
How do you know?

360
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,590
Simple.

361
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,050
From what I saw…

362
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:07,100
If someone hangs himself, the mark
of the rope is u-shaped, facing up.

363
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,510
But his mark was o-shaped. Straight.
It's a murder.

364
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,270
And if there's been a tussle,
there should be nail marks.

365
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,870
There were some.

366
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,030
I don't get this…

367
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,500
Sunil Mukherjee aka Aniket Sen…

368
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,910
Nilanjana can't be traced.

369
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:35,380
I clicked a few pics of her
when she came to us the first day.

370
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,040
We've to check those.

371
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,760
Hello, Asansol Women's college?

372
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,800
Yes, I called you for some info.

373
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,320
Yes, thank you.

374
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,130
Uh… you see…

375
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,030
Nilanjana Sen.

376
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,160
Her father's name is... Aniket Sen.

377
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,460
She studied chemistry. No, a pass-out.

378
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,160
I don't know the year.

379
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:07,380
Actually, it'll be great
if you can give me her address or number.

380
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,070
Yes, sure. Tell me.

381
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,680
Nilanjana…

382
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Huh?

383
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,370
Ah…

384
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,280
Nilanjana died in a road accident
back in 2009.

385
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,360
Huh!

386
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,970
What the hell…

387
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,660
(K sighs)

388
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,580
(unmutes TV)
A supernatural death at Dumdum.

389
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,310
A man lost his mind
and killed himself all of a sudden.

390
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:01,240
Onlookers say he was heard
uttering a 'Chamunda chant'.

391
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,620
A chant used for sacrificial rituals.

392
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,310
(mysterious music)

393
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:21,720
K: I met all the fake beggar cum informers
in the city. Showed her their photo.

394
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,830
Offered them a good sum.
They'll call me if she's spotted.

395
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,310
What about your update?

396
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,080
I visited El Dorado guest house.

397
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,560
No one called Nilanjana Sen
stayed there last week.

398
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,020
They didn't recognize her photo.
Now what?

399
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,070
We've to check that house.

400
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,580
But how? The police sealed the place.

401
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,450
Simple.

402
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,160
A break in.

403
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,100
Hmm.

404
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
Let's go.

405
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,100
(dramatic music)

406
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,360
Watch out.

407
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,670
Signal me if there's anything.
-Should I caw like a crow?

408
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,080
A crow, at night?
-How about a nightingale?

409
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,040
Ventriloquist, are you?
Don't you have a phone?

410
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,310
Put it on silent.
-I'll keep it on vibration mode.

411
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,520
I'll come too?
-Yes.

412
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,260
Why?
-You're the ladder.

413
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,430
Ladder?

414
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
(door shuts)

415
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,370
(upbeat dramatic music)

416
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,680
(night cricket)

417
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,420
Hello… what time is it, Sir?

418
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,790
Time… check your watch please.

419
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,190
(yelps)

420
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,720
Come with me.

421
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,310
(whispers) A mobile…

422
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,100
A hard disc...

423
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,660
Found anything?
-Not much--

424
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Sit!

425
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,580
How did you kill Aniket Sen?
-(K mumbles)

426
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:05,500
Where is the rest of your gang?
-Hey, open his mouth.

427
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,250
Tell us.

428
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,090
(suspenseful music)

429
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,590
Sit here.
-Sit quietly.

430
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,440
Look,

431
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,890
I don't think he knows anything.

432
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,510
Maybe he was hired.

433
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,530
I doubt that he's directly involved.
-Should we let him go with a warning?

434
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,090
Should we break his hand?

435
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,850
(door unbolts)
-Oh no…

436
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,210
Hey, stop right there!

437
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,550
We'll kill you!

438
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,500
Wait!

439
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,870
(upbeat grungy music)

440
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,370
(whistles)

441
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,300
(hammer swishes)

442
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,120
You scoundrel…

443
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,730
(traffic cacophony)

444
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:05,480
K: Aniket is living under a fake ID.
His daughter is looking for him.

445
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,570
But… is Nilanjana his daughter after all?

446
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,240
The point is, this Aniket Sen…

447
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:17,110
Who was he hiding from?

448
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,120
We have to find out about that… Listen.

449
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,000
The day we spotted Aniket…

450
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,260
There was a man…

451
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,560
with Aniket.

452
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,600
Yes.
-He looked quite smart.

453
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,960
They were exchanging… a packet.
-Yes.

454
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,800
We clicked pictures. Show me those.

455
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,050
Quick.
-In the spects, right?

456
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:51,360
Hmm.
-Uh… those have to be in the desktop.

457
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,560
Probably…

458
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,560
There they are!

459
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:58,970
Here.

460
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,630
Zoom in further.
-(clicks keyboard)

461
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,560
Enough, enough.

462
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,830
Hmm. Now do one thing.

463
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,560
Crop out this man's photo.

464
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,500
Put it on the image finder
for… a facial recognition.

465
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,830
Let's see.

466
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,030
Image finder… hmm!

467
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,760
A press release of an official seminar.

468
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,530
What does it say?

469
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,030
Karma Global Company.

470
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,720
Karma Global…

471
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,860
Do one thing. Put the man's photo...

472
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,800
and Karma Global Company together.

473
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,390
Let's do a search on them.

474
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,370
Any link?

475
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,060
Karma Global Company.

476
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,160
His name is Sanjay Bose.

477
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,960
Sanjay Bose.
-Sanjay Bose...

478
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,930
Karma Global Company's…

479
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,240
East region head.
-Good.

480
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,050
He's posted in Kolkata.
-Great.

481
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,550
Karma Global is a multinational company.
They are quite big.

482
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,830
They have many businesses.
They've produced Bengali films too.

483
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,080
Okay, fine.

484
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,600
Um… give Karma Global a call.

485
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,110
Find Sanjay Bose's number and address.

486
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,630
(cartoon on TV)

487
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,600
(TV sounds muffles)

488
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,510
(TV sounds retrieve)

489
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,200
Mini's mother: Mini, dinner time!

490
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,160
Actor: Those that reached the moon,

491
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,700
the world bowed down to them.
(metal clinks)

492
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,110
(mysterious music)

493
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,530
(girl recites Chamunda chant)

494
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,740
What are you doing?

495
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,710
(continues chanting)
-What's all this, Mini!

496
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,870
(continues chanting)
-Hey!

497
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,990
(knife swishes)

498
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,710
Move aside. Don't disturb, please.
-Just one question…

499
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,200
Why the crowd? Give me the address.

500
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,610
This house.

501
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,700
Reporter: A bizarre incident.

502
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,580
A seven-year-old brutally murdered
her father.

503
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,310
K: Check…
-Reporter: People say she was possessed.

504
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,910
(excited crowd chatter)

505
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:24,880
Sir, remember me?

506
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,130
The police only remember criminals
and ministers.

507
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,660
We've met before.

508
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,030
A man had died.

509
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,950
Sunil Mukherjee. I called him Aniket Sen.

510
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,630
I'm K, a private eye. Rings a bell?
-(Scoffs)

511
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,590
A mourner or a detective?
Following all deaths eh? Why?

512
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,370
No...

513
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,960
I came here to meet
Sanjay Bose, he lives here.

514
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,220
You are late.

515
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,660
As in?
-His body is in the ambulance.

516
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,340
The severed head is on its way.

517
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,890
(woman cries)

518
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,230
(Mini keeps chanting)

519
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,590
Careful.

520
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,560
Want water?

521
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,160
Sir, believe me…

522
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,900
Please try to understand.

523
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,240
The things is,
none of these deaths are natural.

524
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,590
Sunil Mukherjee's death…
whether it's a suicide or a murder...

525
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,560
Whether it is interrelated…
-What rubbish huh?

526
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,420
The public says it's a ghost!
The media is creating a circus!

527
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,280
And the seniors are creating pressure!
You think it's related now?

528
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,870
Sir, please try to understand--
-Don't joke around!

529
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,360
Sir, please try to understand...
-Please go away!

530
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,300
Are we ready?
Ask the ambulance to follow us.

531
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,410
Let's go.

532
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,080
Sir, please.

533
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:17,940
Just hear me out for two minutes.
I won't take more than that, please.

534
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,430
Two minutes.
-Yes.

535
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:21,950
Come.

536
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,450
Thank you, Sir.

537
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,860
(ambulance siren approaches)

538
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,700
Sir…

539
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,650
Try to understand that…

540
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:48,950
Sunil Babu's death is not suicide.

541
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,400
Even the evidence suggests a murder.

542
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:55,260
How could you miss this!?
-May or may not be so.

543
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,800
There are orders from seniors,
we've to forego things.

544
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,460
Got it, Mr. K?

545
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,500
(phone rings)
-Constable: Who is it…

546
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,930
Officer: Take the call!

547
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,330
An unknown number, I don't know...
-Sir, look at this photo.

548
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,030
This is Mr. Sanjay.

549
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,160
And this is Sunil Babu.

550
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,480
I have clear proof…

551
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,560
They are talking to each other.

552
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,330
So, they are connected.
It's got to be interlinked.

553
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,780
Who the hell is calling me!
-Just answer it!

554
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,860
Sir, what do I do!

555
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,660
(tyre bursts)

556
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,020
What happened?

557
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:32,330
Driver: Flat tyre.
Should I take it to the garage nearby?

558
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,080
Ask the ambulance to take the body.

559
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,170
Make it quick.

560
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,700
This girl. Please see if you can find her.

561
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:51,600
Leave her photos with us.
-You can keep this one.

562
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:57,880
And file a FIR,
submit all the documents you collected.

563
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,930
I'll see what to do.
-Thank you.

564
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,840
(phone rings)

565
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,190
Again…

566
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,090
Hello?

567
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,520
What!

568
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:16,600
But trust me… I have no doubt...
that the girl did it.

569
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,160
The girl was in some kind of a daze.
Guess you saw her?

570
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,520
(girl recites Chamunda chant)

571
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,530
Yes, when she was being taken.

572
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:34,990
Um… there was another incident
about an evil chant in the news…

573
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,770
Saw it?

574
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,760
Evil chant… Hey!

575
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,700
Uh… the Chamunda chant.
-Exactly.

576
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,070
The girl was chanting the same thing.

577
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,590
What were the words…

578
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,560
The chant? Try to remember!

579
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,960
(Constable chants)

580
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,730
(yells chant)

581
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,880
(ominous music)

582
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,740
(moans)

583
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:44,220
A string of supernatural deaths
in Kolkata.

584
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:49,420
After the Bose family murder case,
Kolkata is trembling in terror.

585
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,620
Because there's no scientific explanation
to these events.

586
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,020
Kolkata is immensely terrified.

587
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,180
People are scared to come out
after it gets dark.

588
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:01,810
Roads are nearly empty.

589
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,560
These incidents that have been
taking place in Kolkata…

590
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,990
A string of supernatural cases…

591
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,310
What do you think as a professor?

592
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,880
It's bogus. Look,

593
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,280
our country makes a big deal
out of feeding stone idols.

594
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:20,820
This is as big a farce, nothing else.

595
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,150
Thanks to the media…

596
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,770
humans are losing respect and fear
for the ghosts.

597
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,920
The ghosts feel insulted!

598
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,750
You mean…

599
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,950
The ghosts are causing these incidents
because they feel insulted?

600
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,270
I don't mean anything.

601
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,200
This is what is happening.

602
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:47,560
Whatever's happening…

603
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,950
It's got nothing to do with ghosts,
spirits or omens.

604
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,490
There are no ghosts.
It's all fake, illogical.

605
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:58,240
The only truth is science.

606
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:02,290
I believe,
these are cases of fear psychosis.

607
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,970
Kolkata's people are
divided in two opinions.

608
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:08,700
One side believes,
all these incidents are supernatural.

609
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,280
Caused by a spirit.

610
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:14,640
And the other side believes,
it's a chain of psychological mishaps.

611
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:19,320
Fear psychosis. What do you think?
Text or Tweet your answer to us!

612
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,700
Same.

613
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,260
It's strange how the same incident
precedes all these deaths.

614
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,420
The same chant.

615
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,860
It's called Chamunda chant.
Used for sacrificial rituals.

616
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:44,610
I think we should look for another case.

617
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:48,670
To hell with the ghosts…
You're a detective. Not a ghost-buster.

618
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,060
A ghost-buster? You think I'm kidding?

619
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,400
Why are they chanting the same thing?

620
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,560
Even he who--
-(phone rings)

621
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:59,900
Hold this.

622
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,330
An informer.

623
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,700
Hello.

624
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:07,310
Yes, where?

625
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,920
I'll be there.

626
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,130
Have to go.

627
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,930
Not you. Do something meanwhile.

628
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,700
Check all news updates.
Newspapers and TV channels.

629
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,480
Make a list of similar incidents
that occurred. Okay?

630
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,970
Nilanjana has been traced.

631
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,770
(mysterious music)

632
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:55,410
K: Where?
-This way.

633
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:58,940
Upstairs.
-Thank you.

634
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,630
Woman: You need to decide soon.
There are other companies as well.

635
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:37,900
We're looking for a price
that's above one million USD.

636
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,490
Is the prototype ready?

637
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,700
Well, Project Morpheus is 100% successful.

638
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,780
And it's ready for implementation.

639
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:48,300
Also, the prototype is highly effective.

640
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,960
And already in use.

641
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,420
Sir, we must go now.

642
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,230
Yes.

643
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,550
Let me get back to you regarding the deal.

644
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:01,990
Thank you so much.

645
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,860
(car door shuts)

646
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:27,430
Officer: Our informer said she went here.

647
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,670
Sir, meeting is over.

648
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,920
And they seem highly interested.

649
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,100
(man) Come fast.

650
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:50,750
Hello!

651
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,920
Hey!

652
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,500
Sit down. We've to talk.

653
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:07,620
Good.

654
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:13,250
(girl hums)

655
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:17,000
Your name?
-So you're Aniket Sen daughter eh?

656
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,330
What did you tell Boris? Spill it, quick.

657
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,090
Stop humming. What did you tell Boris
about Project Morpheus?

658
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,480
What project?

659
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,330
Any idea what can happen
if the project is leaked abroad?

660
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:36,380
(giggles)
We wanted to help our own nation.

661
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,060
But you wouldn't let us help!

662
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:55,370
(yelps)

663
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,890
(hums)

664
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:19,320
You're a good actor.

665
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,060
Thanks.

666
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:29,770
(cocks gun)

667
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,570
(girl giggles)

668
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,630
(laughs loudly)

669
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,660
Nilanjana Sen or someone else?

670
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,870
What's your name?

671
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,920
Stop giggling, will you!

672
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,400
(continues giggling)

673
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,130
What did you think…

674
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:09,310
You can fool me with your horror stories?

675
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,430
You believe in ghosts?

676
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,020
Come to the point.

677
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:16,990
Why did you fake your death?

678
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,800
And who were those foreigners
you were striking a deal with?

679
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,310
You ask such silly questions.

680
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,370
God knows why…

681
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,610
Relax, man.

682
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,750
You found Aniket Sen.

683
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:40,910
I paid you nicely for it.

684
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,370
I don't keep debts.

685
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,560
You saved me today.
So, I want to repay you.

686
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:07,410
Sorry.

687
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,080
No need.

688
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,900
(high frequency heavy metal music)

689
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,400
When I came back to my senses
she was gone.

690
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:59,170
And those two…

691
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:03,880
I had wounded them.

692
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,400
They had vanished too.

693
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:15,260
I had clicked quite a few pictures
with the spects-camera.

694
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:20,330
I guess she figured out.
I don't have the sunglasses anymore.

695
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,500
I am sure that her...

696
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,530
Her lipstick... it had...

697
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,760
It had something.

698
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:37,360
Some chemical or poison.
The moment she kissed me...

699
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:38,510
Huh?

700
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,140
Give me the laptop.

701
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,460
Well, Project Morpheus
is 100% successful.

702
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:54,510
And it's ready for implementation.

703
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:56,510
Project Morpheus.

704
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,330
Project...

705
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,360
Morpheus... (types)

706
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,020
No search results.

707
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,750
Listen.
-Shh!

708
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,500
I mean…
-Quiet.

709
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,500
Don't talk.

710
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,440
Let me think.

711
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,800
There is no food at home.

712
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:36,510
I went to the grocer… but…

713
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:40,090
Uh… We haven't paid last months due.

714
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,030
He yelled at me. Didn't give me food.

715
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,590
If you can give me 500 rupees…

716
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,870
Then I can pay the bill and get some food.

717
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:56,260
Exactly when I'm thinking,
you feel hungry, isn't it?

718
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,840
Bill… Bill! Bill eh?

719
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,790
Bill, right?

720
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:11,330
Go to that room. There are…

721
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,530
a few bills in my black trousers.

722
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:19,040
I mean…
the day I went to Aniket's house,

723
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,720
I found some bills and papers
in the dustbin there.

724
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:26,680
I don't know why I put it in my pocket.

725
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,070
Get me those pants.

726
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:33,210
Here.

727
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:34,810
Hmm?

728
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,800
Vet's receipt.

729
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,680
And what else…

730
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,160
A flight ticket.

731
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:03,960
From three year ago.

732
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,780
Patrika... Amrita...

733
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Got it.

734
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,560
Aniket Sen died on the 5th.
And on the 4th, he…

735
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,810
placed an ad in the paper
from this agency.

736
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:30,190
Someone I know, had come to your agency.

737
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,380
He…

738
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:34,320
He put out an ad.

739
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:37,960
Can you check this and tell me
what the write up was?

740
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,860
Uh… it's against our professional ethics.

741
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Sorry.

742
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,780
Ah. Well if it's against your ethics
then nothing can be…

743
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,220
Tell me one thing.

744
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,740
You've such a cute face.

745
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:55,270
And… a good figure as well.

746
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:59,030
Why don't you join…
modeling or acting maybe?

747
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:03,710
Actually… I've never given it a thought.

748
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:07,090
Give it a thought.
-Contact Sir later.

749
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,070
He's coming up
with a big budget film soon.

750
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:11,780
Oh sure!

751
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,430
Uh anyway, I guess you can't help me.

752
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,640
Um, please Sir…
-No, it's against your ethics.

753
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,490
No, it's fine.
-See what you can do.

754
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:26,350
Will try, Sir.

755
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,580
Sure.

756
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:33,750
Yes, Sir. Found it.
-Tell me.

757
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,420
Sunil Banerjee.
-Sunil Banerjee…

758
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:39,090
He placed an ad in the Friendship column.

759
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:45,640
Amazing nights in Kolkata at Tollygunje.
All new girls. Evergreen love.

760
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,490
Very interesting, entertaining women.

761
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:52,400
Magical experience. Enjoy togetherness.

762
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:53,630
9th May.

763
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:58,330
Nilanjana Sen's father, Aniket Sen.

764
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,390
He was living under a fake ID.

765
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:03,900
Got murdered…

766
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,500
as Sunil Mukherjee.

767
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,110
The police won't accept it's a murder.

768
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:16,350
Two strange men are after something.
They tried to kill me.

769
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,430
A hidden hard disk at his place.

770
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,200
Ad in the paper.

771
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:28,380
(sighs heavily)

772
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:32,490
God knows what's going on!

773
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:39,630
It's for free. Want?

774
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:46,260
I ate a lot, this one's for free.

775
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,680
It's good. Have it.

776
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,780
Have it?

777
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:02,500
Always beating me.

778
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,050
Money.

779
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:16,250
I've a thousand rupee note.
No change. You pay it.

780
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:17,370
Huh?

781
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:18,750
I don't have money.

782
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:21,830
(sighs)

783
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:29,740
Here, withdraw from the ATM.
Not more than 500 rupees.

784
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:31,700
Get 100-rupee notes. Don't steal.

785
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:34,200
Vendor: My money?
-What's the code?

786
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,230
3-2-1-0.

787
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,540
3-2-1-0.

788
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,240
3-2-1-0.
-What the…

789
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,270
Vendor: Pay me first.
-Wait.

790
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,900
Code eh…

791
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:48,770
Code?

792
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,800
(dramatic music)

793
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:22,360
Anik…

794
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:25,760
Angel View...

795
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,290
Yes!

796
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:37,430
Secret Eye Unemployed Association,
taken to begging?

797
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,160
Huh?

798
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:48,140
Is this a place to sit and think?

799
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:53,320
Aniket Sen put out this ad.
-Huh…

800
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,340
To send a coded message to someone.

801
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,080
Huh.

802
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,860
What's written in the ad…

803
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:07,300
If we take the first letters
of each of the words…

804
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,520
The meaning is…

805
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,960
A-N-I-K. Anik. Look.

806
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,760
And then, Angel View.

807
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,430
Then, 'meet 9th May'.

808
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,450
(grins)

809
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:27,500
Angel View is a well-known
nursing home in Kolkata.

810
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:31,300
There's someone called Anik there.

811
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,320
Who's related to this case.

812
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,080
We've to find out who he is.

813
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:39,170
So our next destination: Angel View.

814
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,600
(mysterious music)

815
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,760
(presses button)

816
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:51,000
K: Are all the floors high security?
-No. It's just the 4th floor.

817
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,360
It's high security.
Not everyone is allowed.

818
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,930
Lunch break is going on.
You have two minutes.

819
01:03:57,010 --> 01:04:00,610
Finish by then, or I'll be in trouble.
I'm the head ward boy.

820
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:03,960
They will kill me… So, two minutes.
-No, don't worry about that.

821
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,360
It's fine.

822
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:11,260
Come.

823
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,020
(muttering gibberish)

824
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,280
(latches door)

825
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:12,550
Why is he tied up?

826
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:15,650
He gets violent bouts. That's why.

827
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,670
Just two minutes.
-Hmm.

828
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:28,530
Anik.

829
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:31,950
Anik?

830
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:35,580
I didn't kill anyone…

831
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:40,000
It was them... They asked me to kill.

832
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,630
The voices in my head…

833
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:46,180
Ma! I'm hungry!

834
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,770
Yes, I killed him!
-What's he being treated for?

835
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:51,330
How long is he here?

836
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:52,810
I don't know.

837
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:57,730
Another man had come before you.
No one ever came asking for them before.

838
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,230
Who was he?

839
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:01,770
Um… what was his name…

840
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,850
Abhirup or Aniket…

841
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:05,550
Aniket Sen.
-Maybe.

842
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,800
Aniket.

843
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,940
You know anyone called Aniket Sen?

844
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:15,410
Have you heard the name, 'Aniket Sen'?
Aniket Sen?

845
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:19,150
Aniket Sen came to talk to you, right?

846
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:20,840
Who…

847
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:25,970
Who is Anik…
-Sanjay Bose? Sanjay Bose, Aniket…

848
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:27,360
Chuck it, bro.

849
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,260
He has completely lost his head.

850
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:33,460
Please make it fast.
-Quiet.

851
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:40,720
Listen--
-I'm hungry, Ma!

852
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,130
Know anything about Karma Global?

853
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:46,400
Karma Global. Anik? Karma Global…

854
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,680
Please try to recall. Karma Global.
-(mumbles)

855
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:55,310
Who brought you here?
-Your two minutes are over! Come!

856
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:59,490
I will kill you! (grunts angrily)
-Let's go!

857
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,750
(cries) Ma, give me food!

858
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,920
Ma…

859
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,860
Please give me food. I am hungry...

860
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:11,730
Anik, Anik… listen.

861
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:13,230
Anik! Anik!

862
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,160
You know about Project Morpheus?

863
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:21,760
Project Morpheus! Project... Morph--

864
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,160
-It's all over.

865
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,010
As in? Speak out, Anik!

866
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:29,580
They finished me...
-Who are they?

867
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,860
They finished…

868
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,860
Anik, who?

869
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,560
I'm trapped.

870
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:38,900
Anik…
-You'll be trapped too!

871
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,550
(yells)

872
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:44,030
(yells chant)

873
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,830
Let's go!

874
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,230
Come on, hurry up!

875
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:54,700
Let's go, they'll hear us! Quick!

876
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:59,520
Come on!

877
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,870
(yells)

878
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,760
We've to plan something.

879
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,730
What plan?
-Aniket used code lingo in that ad.

880
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:14,970
It communicated to whoever
it was intended for. They understood it.

881
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,070
We've to put out another ad like that.

882
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:22,990
Tell me what you make of this.

883
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,600
Nothing.

884
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,400
You don't get it?

885
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:33,810
But whoever knows the code
will fathom it. I mean, Aniket's…

886
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:38,080
secret ad…
Whoever could decipher its code…

887
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:44,210
What it means is…

888
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:45,350
“Uncle!

889
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,860
Day after,

890
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:52,560
Moon hotel, bypass road, 4 pm.
Come in red clothes?

891
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:56,510
We'll talk about Karma Global
and Project Morpheus, okay?”

892
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,020
That's what I wrote.

893
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:04,850
The ad's out but no phone call yet--

894
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:06,700
-(phone rings)

895
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,100
Phone…

896
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:11,400
There you go!

897
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,970
Unknown number.

898
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,320
Hello?

899
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:22,800
Lady: Hello... I don't have red clothes.

900
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:25,040
Red clothes…

901
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:29,790
Right, but…

902
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,230
Who are you? Your name?

903
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:35,010
4 pm, today. Moon Bar, on the bypass.

904
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:38,650
Come alone. In red clothes.
-Moon Bar. Yes… but…

905
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,330
The problem is…

906
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,250
I don't have red clothes.

907
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:44,660
But…

908
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,920
I have a red pair of shades.
Can I come wearing that?

909
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:52,330
And--
-(disconnects)

910
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:54,490
She hung up.

911
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:56,060
Who?

912
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:57,210
Your aunt.

913
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:01,190
She passed away seven years ago.

914
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:04,710
She is back.

915
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,030
She has a date with me at Moon Bar.

916
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,230
Today evening.

917
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:11,160
We'll have fun.

918
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:15,900
You're her nephew, it'll be awkward.
So I will go alone.

919
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:19,790
Won't that be risky?

920
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:23,100
Of course it's risky…

921
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,590
That's what I'm thinking.

922
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:29,350
I don't know who she was...

923
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:32,630
And I--
-Listen.

924
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:34,860
Carry your gun.

925
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,800
And here, a GPS tracker.
-What…

926
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,900
Carry it.

927
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,600
Okay?

928
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,200
The gun is fine.

929
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,600
But why a GPS tracker?

930
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:51,660
If they kill you and dump your body...

931
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:54,820
then your corpse
can be tracked through this--

932
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,000
-Shut up!

933
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:59,590
Why the hell are you so negative
all the time?

934
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:01,570
No positive vibe!

935
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,220
Where's my jacket?

936
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,790
Uh…
-Bring it!

937
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:22,400
Are you the one… red shades…
From that ad?

938
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:26,220
Yes, I put out that ad.

939
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,790
I am K. Krishno.

940
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:28,900
Private Detective.

941
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:32,700
This is my card.

942
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:34,010
Chuck it.

943
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,160
I've seen many like you.

944
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:37,930
Just tell me what you want.

945
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:41,250
I want to know the truth.
And believe me, I--

946
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:44,880
-Hey. Buy me a drink.
Then I'll believe you.

947
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:46,220
Waiter…

948
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,140
Your… name please?

949
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:52,000
Umarani Das.
-What-rani?

950
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:56,500
Umarani.
-Umarani Das.

951
01:11:58,290 --> 01:11:59,650
Let's get to work?

952
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:04,730
What's your relation with Aniket Sen.
And what is Project Morpheus.

953
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:06,740
Project Morpheus…

954
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:13,520
It was five years ago.

955
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:17,510
I saw an ad in the paper.

956
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:21,630
A company called… Karma something...

957
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:23,830
they were inviting for interviews.

958
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:27,120
When I went, I saw it was a farce.
Their company was…

959
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:31,120
looking for people.
For some kind of testing.

960
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,200
Okay.

961
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,050
They were offering quite a sum.

962
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:37,360
I got greedy. Signed the contract.

963
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,330
Another fifteen people were selected.

964
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:42,300
I didn't know first.

965
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:46,930
Later, I realized we all had something
in common.

966
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,400
We all needed the money.

967
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,430
And no one to call our own.

968
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:56,700
We were called to Tollygunje.

969
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,800
Then they put us in a bus.

970
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:03,130
Took us to... some kind of a factory.

971
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:07,790
When we got into the bus,
they blindfolded us.

972
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:10,550
Don't know where they took us.
-How was this place?

973
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:13,470
A huge white coloured house
amidst the factory shed.

974
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:16,760
A lot of security. Very high walls.

975
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:18,840
They didn't let us step out.

976
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:22,180
Maybe the place was close to the sea.

977
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:26,900
There was a… saline smell in the air.

978
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:31,410
What happened there?
-They showed us a lot of TV.

979
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:37,460
Kept us locked up in a white room.

980
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:40,950
The headache was terrible.

981
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,630
That's where I met Aniket Sen.

982
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,870
He used to counsel us.

983
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:49,600
And then?
-(woman sighs)

984
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:51,960
They let us go one day.

985
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:55,660
Blindfolded us, brought us to Tollygunje.

986
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:57,350
Later,

987
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,660
the headaches...

988
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:01,630
got worse.

989
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,190
Went to a doctor.

990
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,560
Then I discovered it...

991
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:08,630
brain cancer.

992
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:14,900
I found out,
whoever participated in the test,

993
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:19,850
either they had brain cancer.
Or they lost their minds.

994
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:21,900
What did you do about it?

995
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:26,700
A few of us went to their office,
threatened them.

996
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,080
Hmm.

997
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:31,260
Threatened to file a case. Tell the media.

998
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,730
They immediately offered us
a lot of money.

999
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,930
And they said they'll treat us for free
at their hospital.

1000
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,790
Angel View huh?
-Yes.

1001
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:41,900
Hmm.

1002
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:45,630
Soon I realized,
the disease was not to go.

1003
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:49,150
Everyone's condition was deteriorating.

1004
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,930
So, I fled from there.

1005
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:54,330
I went to the police. But to no avail.

1006
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:57,430
They filed a case against me!

1007
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,140
And Aniket Sen?

1008
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,950
He was a good man.

1009
01:15:02,610 --> 01:15:06,030
He realized that the company
was up to something fishy.

1010
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:08,560
So he quit his job.

1011
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:11,500
He too was on the run, like me.

1012
01:15:11,870 --> 01:15:15,380
They were tapping his phone.
So we would speak through codes.

1013
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:19,250
He wanted to expose the company.

1014
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:23,300
He had some files with him,
regarding the test.

1015
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:26,610
He wanted to give it to the media.
But before that…

1016
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,900
they found him.

1017
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:30,480
Suicide, my foot.

1018
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:32,520
They killed him.

1019
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:35,660
Sanjay Bose, from that company…

1020
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:38,430
He was helping us.
So he had to die as well.

1021
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,460
I know, I too won't survive.

1022
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:45,500
But before I die…

1023
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,500
This company...

1024
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:50,060
I'll destroy them!

1025
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,910
(scoffs) But how?

1026
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:56,760
They have Aniket Sen's evidences.
-Not all of it.

1027
01:15:57,370 --> 01:15:59,580
He knew he could get caught.

1028
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:03,860
So he left some files with me.
I'll give it to the media.

1029
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:08,360
You can give those files to me.
I could… you know...

1030
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:11,430
uh... help you with this.

1031
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:16,790
I have some contacts in the media.
It'll be easier.

1032
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:21,300
Besides, the police
has a complaint filed against you.

1033
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,010
They're looking for you.

1034
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:26,940
Will the media listen to you
if you go to them?

1035
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:29,450
You know how connected they are.
Hmm?

1036
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:32,890
Fine.

1037
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:36,770
I'll show it to you.
Tomorrow evening, Tollygunje.

1038
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:49,150
Excuse me, why not today?
-No. Tomorrow, Tollygunje, at 4.

1039
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,360
Hello!

1040
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:57,310
Hello!

1041
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:02,250
There's still time.

1042
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,040
Don't get involved in this.

1043
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:05,350
And…

1044
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,860
that woman; let us handle her.

1045
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,690
Got it?
-Keep this.

1046
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:14,730
I don't take money like that.
-Really now?

1047
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:15,830
But I do.

1048
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,580
To each their own.

1049
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:26,410
Keep your distance.

1050
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,220
You'll feel bad if I shoot you…

1051
01:17:30,970 --> 01:17:32,890
Hold the key. Come on!
-Me…

1052
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,870
Can you ride a bike?
-No…

1053
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:37,650
Try it! Sit and kick-start it!

1054
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,120
Quick.

1055
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:43,640
You're chasing me, following me.
Just tell me why, little boy!

1056
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:47,180
This is not done.
-Go tell Mommy, she'll scold me.

1057
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,560
(mock sobs)

1058
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:52,090
Start the bike!
-(ignition turned on)

1059
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,490
Wow, she did it!
-Come.

1060
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:56,660
I've to go. Buh-bye, see you.

1061
01:17:58,030 --> 01:18:00,060
Uh-huh, don't scratch your bum.

1062
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:04,570
Good boy. Down, boy. Down.

1063
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:05,930
Down!

1064
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:09,010
As a part of your job
you'll follow me now.

1065
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,260
But we can't afford that.
Hence, a flat tyre is imperative.

1066
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:15,100
I've to go.

1067
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:16,370
Sorry, dude.

1068
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,600
(empty gun clicks)

1069
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:23,100
It doesn't work.

1070
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,160
You don't use it, do you...

1071
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,330
Use mine.

1072
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:33,430
It's locked you see.
-Okay, this is unlocked now. Use it.

1073
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:35,480
A gun that works.

1074
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,050
Go for it. Fully loaded!

1075
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:50,990
She's gone!

1076
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:54,150
Didn't even say bye…

1077
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:57,210
Now what, dear boy?

1078
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:02,330
Nothing good can come out of this.
-No.

1079
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:03,700
Has to get worse.

1080
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:05,410
Huh…

1081
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:07,030
(punches)

1082
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:18,360
(tyres screech)

1083
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:24,600
(K grunts in pain)

1084
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,520
(guns cock)

1085
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,450
(gunshots fired)

1086
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,760
Good
-Done.

1087
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:51,400
Sir, he is dead.
We'll track the rest of them soon.

1088
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:53,230
Sir.

1089
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:56,850
No, why him… no one knows we're
from the central government.

1090
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:00,580
Sir! The state police know nothing.

1091
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,660
We're maintaining the mission's
confidentiality. As per your order.

1092
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:09,110
Yes, a foreign racket is involved in this.

1093
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:12,940
Okay, Sir. Will take care of the body.

1094
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:14,180
In half an hour--

1095
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,080
(fires shot)

1096
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:34,980
Don't go zigzag. Shoot straight.

1097
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:37,130
(gun fires)

1098
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:43,570
(whimpers)

1099
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:51,140
(car approaches)

1100
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:02,300
(whistles)

1101
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:32,650
Who are you?

1102
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:38,770
Who? You are K (Who). Not me.
-Why have you been helping me?

1103
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:40,230
What do you want?

1104
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:46,200
(moans) The bullet grazed past.

1105
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:48,990
There will be blood loss.
But don't worry.

1106
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:54,330
Who are you?

1107
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:57,420
Do you read novels? Like thrillers?

1108
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:02,280
As in?
-Say you're reading a good thriller.

1109
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:06,870
What if someone gives you a spoiler?
Tells you how it will end.

1110
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:08,390
Will you like it?

1111
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:11,760
I don't understand…
-Reach the last page.

1112
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,710
You're on the right track, I assure you.

1113
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,040
Okay.

1114
01:22:28,430 --> 01:22:29,570
Get up.

1115
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,880
Come on.

1116
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,920
How do you know my place?

1117
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:42,330
(scoffs)

1118
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:43,540
Go.

1119
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:49,230
Should I carry you?

1120
01:22:49,810 --> 01:22:50,810
Careful.

1121
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,120
Bye.

1122
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,440
Drive.

1123
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:11,250
Who was he…

1124
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:20,260
Thank God I was wearing
the bullet proof jacket.

1125
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:26,660
God knows why these, men want to
interrogate me, follow me, kill me…

1126
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:31,380
And who the hell was that man?
Saved me twice.

1127
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:35,300
He knows where I live. Strange...

1128
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,440
God knows who he is.

1129
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:39,900
What about the girl?

1130
01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:43,000
She drove off with our bike.

1131
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,200
What!

1132
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:47,960
Hmm. But I think I'll find her.

1133
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:49,840
How?

1134
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:53,060
Remember the GPS tracker?
-Yes.

1135
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,770
I had put it in her bag.

1136
01:23:57,250 --> 01:24:00,260
It will lead us to her.
And she'll lead us…

1137
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,030
to the files.

1138
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:08,240
(birds chirping)

1139
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:13,320
K: It says, it's the house on right.
-But my bike?

1140
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,700
Shut up. The file is more important.

1141
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:23,850
Come on in.

1142
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:26,190
(gate squeaks) K: Quiet!

1143
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:40,590
(door squeaks)

1144
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,590
Door is open. She must be in.

1145
01:24:44,670 --> 01:24:47,750
She's a crack job. Try to stay quiet.

1146
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,460
She'll argue a lot--

1147
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,260
S**t!

1148
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,240
My God…

1149
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:02,760
She is dead.

1150
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:05,260
Looks like a drug overdose.

1151
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:06,810
Uh-huh.

1152
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:10,410
It's been made to look like that.

1153
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,580
Look at her hand and neck.

1154
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,830
It's forceful killing. Proved.

1155
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,760
See if you find any documents
or files. Open the bag.

1156
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:21,870
Harami: Where…

1157
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:23,370
K: Check.

1158
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,600
She said she has some files
on Project Morpheus.

1159
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:28,870
S**t.

1160
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,850
Let me think.

1161
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,980
Maybe the place was close to the sea.

1162
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:39,480
There was a… saline smell in the air.

1163
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,110
Close to Tollygunge…
I mean a couple of hours from there.

1164
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,490
Is there a seaside?

1165
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,420
Um, Digha.

1166
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:49,910
Rubbish.

1167
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,900
Not Digha.

1168
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:55,780
Erm… Bakkhali.
Bakkhali, Diamond Harbour.

1169
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:57,910
Do one thing.

1170
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:00,650
Run a search on Google Earth.

1171
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:06,050
See if there's an abandoned factory
or warehouse near Bakkhali.

1172
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:07,330
Near seaside.

1173
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,410
Okay.
-Check it! Check it!

1174
01:26:09,630 --> 01:26:10,630
Search!

1175
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:16,520
Bakkhali… Here it is.

1176
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:19,830
Two factories. One is closed.
The sea is nearby.

1177
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:24,190
Let's go.

1178
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:25,980
Quick.

1179
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:35,300
Harami: No one visits that factory.
They say it's haunted.

1180
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:37,390
K: Haunted? Must be the one.

1181
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,630
So, Umarani wasn't lying.

1182
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:45,570
Entering will be easy.
But we've to find an escape route.

1183
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:49,930
First, I'll go. Then you come.
Find a way to escape meanwhile.

1184
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:54,170
Anything could happen.
Please keep the mobile handy.

1185
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:55,560
I will call you.

1186
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,200
(suspenseful music)

1187
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,400
(blows)

1188
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:55,710
(panting)

1189
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:23,000
(electronic buzz and beeping)

1190
01:29:39,770 --> 01:29:41,050
What's going on…

1191
01:29:45,870 --> 01:29:47,620
I don't get it.

1192
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:04,640
It's dangerous for our party
if A.K. Dutta stay alive.

1193
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:07,260
I've known him for years.

1194
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,320
(chuckles) He's very arrogant.

1195
01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:13,460
He won't help himself, nor his nation.

1196
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:16,450
You tell me, what's the update.

1197
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:18,260
Well…

1198
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,930
Team Z has arrived on location.

1199
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:23,350
Dutta will reach in 40 minutes.

1200
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:26,200
Agent A will meet Dutta at his place.

1201
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:29,540
ETA, maximum 120 minutes.

1202
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:33,730
And… our Defence Minister...

1203
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:36,620
How secure is he in Kolkata?

1204
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:39,330
There's high security in Delhi
and other states.

1205
01:30:39,410 --> 01:30:42,260
But he has minimal security
in Kolkata, at his house.

1206
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:47,030
His trusted house help, Nabin...
is our guy.

1207
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:48,750
Look,

1208
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:51,590
Dutta is our last obstacle.

1209
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:53,300
(chuckles) Not for long.

1210
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,490
The world will change tonight.

1211
01:30:57,850 --> 01:31:00,810
Don't worry.
Everything will work out just fine.

1212
01:31:01,090 --> 01:31:04,140
Transfer the payment please.
-Yes, sure.

1213
01:31:05,690 --> 01:31:06,690
Done.

1214
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:10,970
You see, Dutta--
-(mechanized voice) Security breach!

1215
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:12,080
(gun fires)

1216
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,220
(alarm rings)
-Please sit.

1217
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:20,030
Get up.

1218
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:43,520
Really.

1219
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:46,520
You're good at your job.

1220
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,600
Lucky guy, I must say.

1221
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:53,200
You lived last time. (gun cocks)

1222
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,760
This time you won't.

1223
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,380
(phone rings)

1224
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Yes, Sir.

1225
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:03,510
Okay, Sir.

1226
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,210
Lucky again.

1227
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:26,550
Hi.

1228
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:30,050
Surprised to see us? Hmm?

1229
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:34,560
Of course.

1230
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:39,120
Priyanka. A trusted agent of ours.

1231
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:42,720
And you are?

1232
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,640
Sam.

1233
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:48,680
Sam?

1234
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:50,930
Christian?

1235
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,740
A quintessential Bengali.

1236
01:32:54,270 --> 01:32:56,530
Samir Bose. Sam.

1237
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:00,990
Last page.

1238
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:03,150
Okay. Ask me.

1239
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,160
What is Project Morpheus.

1240
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,600
(sniffs)

1241
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:15,660
You smell nice. Is it the perfume?

1242
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:18,990
Yes. Why?
-Which company?

1243
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:22,070
'X'
-Why that company?

1244
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:25,540
Actually, I… I like it--

1245
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:27,790
-What do you like about it?
-The fragrance.

1246
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:31,980
Any deodorant smells nice.
Why would it smell bad?

1247
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:33,160
Think carefully.

1248
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:37,870
Yes… I mean the ad…
-Ah!

1249
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:40,880
Now you're talking.

1250
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:44,230
Let me see your feet. Ah!

1251
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:46,220
Greenland!

1252
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:47,550
How much?

1253
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:49,230
6,500 rupees.

1254
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:51,810
Why a Greenland?

1255
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:54,510
There are so many companies in the market.

1256
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:57,750
Why not buy
a cheap Chinese pair of shoes?

1257
01:33:57,830 --> 01:34:01,990
Here. This is for 650 rupees.
Solid stuff, brother.

1258
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:06,030
Tell me, why this brand?

1259
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:10,260
My choice... It's a big brand.
And the advertisement was good.

1260
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:13,410
Let me see your pants.
-What!

1261
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:17,730
Why are you pulling it?
-The corporates are stripping you anyway.

1262
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:22,520
These brands price their goods
exorbitantly, why buy from them?

1263
01:34:23,810 --> 01:34:26,880
What do you mean?
-That people don't have an opinion.

1264
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,340
Nor any preferences.
It's just marketing.

1265
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:37,440
No matter how much you grin.
Here's the truth…

1266
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:41,020
You have no personal preferences,
nor opinions.

1267
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:44,350
Nothing called individuality.
Believe me.

1268
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,790
You're being told everything.
You're being taught.

1269
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:49,330
Think about the elections.

1270
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:53,820
The marketing companies
and media fed it to the people.

1271
01:34:53,910 --> 01:34:55,970
“Vote for him. He will bring change.”

1272
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:59,370
And people cheerfully went
and voted him in!

1273
01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:03,100
Media and advertising,
they are the decision makers.

1274
01:35:03,310 --> 01:35:06,600
You have blind faith in them.
-Yes, but what's your point?

1275
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:11,200
Project Morpheus is a kind of
mind control technology.

1276
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:12,810
What…

1277
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:16,010
'Post hypnotic suggestion', heard of it?

1278
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:23,730
(voice over) Hypnotise humans.
And feed them information in that state.

1279
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:28,380
It gets printed
in their subconscious mind.

1280
01:35:29,170 --> 01:35:32,120
They regain consciousness,
but unknowingly,

1281
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:34,530
they follow the instructions given.

1282
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:37,270
The objective of Project Morpheus was,

1283
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:42,300
to amply hypnotic sedation
through technology, audio visually.

1284
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:49,090
Forcing people to buy the product
of a specific brand subconsciously

1285
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:50,980
was our original aim.

1286
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,660
Music is making people violent.

1287
01:35:55,030 --> 01:35:57,740
If that's supernatural
then I am a super-ghost!

1288
01:35:58,570 --> 01:35:59,570
One minute.

1289
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:02,460
And the Chamunda chant?
-Just a gimmick.

1290
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:05,830
By transmitting signals
through interference,

1291
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:09,410
we can place audio visual
post hypnotic suggestions.

1292
01:36:12,010 --> 01:36:14,960
But how are you involved with this?
-(chuckles)

1293
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:19,880
I am one of the creators
of Project Morpheus. I'll clarify.

1294
01:36:20,970 --> 01:36:24,950
After developing the system,
we began the human testing phase.

1295
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:26,620
It was high-risk.

1296
01:36:27,230 --> 01:36:29,600
So we got hold of
some specific test subjects.

1297
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:32,270
Indian government found out.

1298
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:34,550
Attached itself with us.

1299
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:37,130
And their plan was
to weaponize the technology.

1300
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:41,710
Prof. Aniket Sen had a lot to contribute.

1301
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:44,860
But he didn't support the weaponization.

1302
01:36:45,730 --> 01:36:47,480
Anyway, the testing continued.

1303
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:50,300
And one day we were finally successful.

1304
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:55,450
Then the Indian army back-stabbed us.

1305
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,410
They banned the project.

1306
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:01,900
They deemed it unethical.

1307
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:05,160
Defence Minister A.K. Dutta…
the main culprit.

1308
01:37:06,550 --> 01:37:10,700
But I'm a stubborn man. I continued
the research even after the ban.

1309
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:15,200
Got in touch
with some international arms dealers.

1310
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:17,950
They wanted to buy the project.

1311
01:37:18,030 --> 01:37:20,810
Those meetings were meant
to lure the Indian government.

1312
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:22,760
And the ghostly incidents…

1313
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:25,530
were demos. You know, samples.

1314
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:28,750
A.K. Dutta saw all this
and finally looked interested.

1315
01:37:28,830 --> 01:37:31,630
Couldn't do anything directly.
He put the 'RAW' after me.

1316
01:37:32,370 --> 01:37:36,230
Seeing the demos,
the ruling and the opposition parties…

1317
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:38,950
both were interested in our project.

1318
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:43,930
So the deal was, if A.K. Dutta died,

1319
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:47,670
whoever came to replace him
would team up with us.

1320
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,840
They'll pay a high price to buy
the project, use it to gain votes.

1321
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:54,060
Get it? Uh…

1322
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:55,810
Votes?

1323
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:03,980
Before the election, I'll put in
a tiny post hypnotic suggestion,

1324
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:07,920
through audio or video:
Vote for Rose symbol.

1325
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:09,270
That's it.

1326
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:13,150
You're bound to cast your vote
on the rose symbol!

1327
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:18,160
If there's no rose sign on the ballot,
you'll draw the symbol and vote for it.

1328
01:38:18,950 --> 01:38:22,110
This is unethical.
There will be no freewill in the country!

1329
01:38:28,690 --> 01:38:30,210
Welcome to the future!

1330
01:38:33,590 --> 01:38:35,020
What fun…

1331
01:38:37,450 --> 01:38:40,350
No one will make any decisions.
We'll tell them what to do.

1332
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:42,840
No stress.

1333
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:45,660
Crime rate will decrease immensely.

1334
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:47,960
Just an order: Don't rape!

1335
01:38:48,730 --> 01:38:52,740
No one will rape after that. The idea
of doing it won't even occur to them!

1336
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:57,150
What you're doing is terrorism too.

1337
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,730
People won't have freewill.
Democracy will cease to exist.

1338
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:04,660
Are you a fascist!?
-Spell 'fascist' for me please!

1339
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:07,050
All fancy words!

1340
01:39:13,710 --> 01:39:15,240
Listen, we don't have time.

1341
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:20,200
The Defence Minister's done for.
We could have planned a suicide.

1342
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:22,600
But his team is quite intelligent.

1343
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,700
He wears protective lens
and ear-chip, like me.

1344
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,760
Hypnosis can't work on him.

1345
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:30,730
The house help has been put to it.
He'll butcher the guy.

1346
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:34,250
(sighs heavily)
-Listen, here's a piece of bitter truth.

1347
01:39:34,730 --> 01:39:36,420
Humans don't deserve freewill.

1348
01:39:37,150 --> 01:39:40,550
They vote influenced by marketing.
Ask them, you'll realise…

1349
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:44,480
Majority of the Indian population
has no political view or awareness.

1350
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:47,360
They don't know who they are voting for
and why!

1351
01:39:47,450 --> 01:39:50,220
Bloody cattle. Self-centered lot.

1352
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:54,320
They do candle marches against rape.
But if they witness a rape…

1353
01:39:54,450 --> 01:39:57,740
they flee! No freewill for them!
What to do?

1354
01:39:59,010 --> 01:40:00,370
(detonator beeps)

1355
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:02,280
(loud explosion)

1356
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:03,820
(Sam coughs)

1357
01:40:10,490 --> 01:40:11,490
(coughs)

1358
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:18,370
Hands up. Gun down!

1359
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:21,970
Go! Go!

1360
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:32,100
Gun down! Gun down!

1361
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:34,180
Gun down!

1362
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:36,870
Hands up! Come on!

1363
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:45,800
(coughs) How to escape?

1364
01:40:46,090 --> 01:40:47,310
That way.

1365
01:41:00,210 --> 01:41:01,210
Get in.

1366
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:14,570
Which way?
-Right!

1367
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,480
Now?
-Straight.

1368
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:21,850
S**t! It's blocked!

1369
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:23,810
No, there's an opening. Go.

1370
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,050
Take a right.

1371
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:29,020
Now go straight.

1372
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:35,320
Officer, this is detective K.
-Yes.

1373
01:41:35,670 --> 01:41:37,860
Defence Minister's life is in danger.
-Huh!

1374
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:40,860
What!
-I'll explain later.

1375
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:44,360
Just tell the security so that
they let me in.

1376
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,730
(dramatic music)

1377
01:42:08,290 --> 01:42:09,290
(sighs)

1378
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:11,370
Officer, let's go in.
-Come.

1379
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:12,490
Thank you.

1380
01:42:12,740 --> 01:42:13,740
One minute.

1381
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:19,080
Okay. Come.

1382
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:22,770
I know Sam is behind this.

1383
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:28,880
Not at all.

1384
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,610
It's very tough to touch me.

1385
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:43,740
Sure.

1386
01:42:44,670 --> 01:42:46,140
(metal clinks)

1387
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:50,140
Don't worry.
These ghostly incidents will soon stop.

1388
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:51,930
I'm taking strong steps.

1389
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:02,830
Don't worry.
Project Morpheus has been eradicated.

1390
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:06,280
And soon, we will find Sam.
-(metal tray clinks)

1391
01:43:09,410 --> 01:43:10,410
(gun fires)

1392
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:21,050
Sir, are you fine?

1393
01:43:22,650 --> 01:43:23,650
Yes.

1394
01:43:23,970 --> 01:43:26,930
Sir, this is Mr. K. Private investigator.

1395
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:28,220
Hello.

1396
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:30,530
Thank you, thank you…

1397
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:32,390
Are you okay?

1398
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:33,900
Yes, I'm okay.

1399
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:35,460
Actually, Sir…

1400
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:38,410
a man named Sam
is conducting a ghastly operation...

1401
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:41,880
He's behind all of this.
Karma Global Company is involved.

1402
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:43,530
Project Morpheus?
-Yes, Sir.

1403
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:45,760
I won't leave them.

1404
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:49,010
Officer.
-Yes, Sir.

1405
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:50,930
Take him out.

1406
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:52,820
Guards, take away the body.

1407
01:44:05,230 --> 01:44:09,380
Okay…
we've to finish Project Morpheus today.

1408
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:11,000
Sir, excuse me.

1409
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:14,960
I suggest, if you can kindly…
help me with man-force.

1410
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:17,330
I mean if you can trust me…

1411
01:44:18,310 --> 01:44:21,770
Project Morpheus, I mean Sam's project.

1412
01:44:22,050 --> 01:44:25,890
And the research hubs and hide outs
he's got… I know all of them now.

1413
01:44:26,310 --> 01:44:28,320
I can take you--
-(phone rings)

1414
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:34,360
Sir, excuse me, I've to take a call.

1415
01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:38,510
Hello.

1416
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,700
Hello… Hello…

1417
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:44,110
Know this.

1418
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:45,880
Sam is a genius.

1419
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,840
(electronic muffle)

1420
01:44:59,650 --> 01:45:00,650
Go.

1421
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:01,830
Prepare the force.

1422
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:04,710
I'll inform the High Command.

1423
01:45:05,490 --> 01:45:07,970
Hello, we found Sam. We will…

1424
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:28,200
(gun fires)

1425
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,160
(water splashes)

1426
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:39,950
Welcome home!

1427
01:46:49,650 --> 01:46:51,660
Now you're on the last page for real.

1428
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:53,410
(presses key)

1429
01:46:53,770 --> 01:46:55,950
Got a flashback?

1430
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:02,760
(presses key)

1431
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:07,420
You are our asset.

1432
01:47:09,990 --> 01:47:13,460
The first successful test subject
of Project Morpheus.

1433
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:18,520
We trained you to be a killing machine.

1434
01:47:19,630 --> 01:47:23,600
We activated your killer instinct
through post-hypnotic suggestion.

1435
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:27,910
We control your brain as per our needs.

1436
01:47:28,270 --> 01:47:30,770
And you kill people
as per our instructions.

1437
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:32,620
Bam!

1438
01:47:32,710 --> 01:47:34,170
Then you forget everything.

1439
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:37,460
You came to us three years ago,
seeing an ad on the paper.

1440
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:45,700
(medical equipments beep)

1441
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:49,490
We transformed you.

1442
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:51,180
Trained you.

1443
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,200
You forgot
that you are actually Subir Pal.

1444
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:56,530
We placed you in the society as K.

1445
01:47:56,750 --> 01:47:59,030
Private Investigator, Krishnodas.

1446
01:47:59,170 --> 01:48:03,030
Because through our research
on Subir's bio-data, we figured…

1447
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:06,360
you have excellent observation
and detection skills.

1448
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:08,570
And we put Harami as your assistant.

1449
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:13,390
Meet him. His name is Sridip.
Your handler.

1450
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:16,940
He was employed to inform me
on your progress. Think about it.

1451
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:20,920
We can create millions
of killing machines like you.

1452
01:48:21,930 --> 01:48:24,930
When Aniket Sen fled
with the proof he collected,

1453
01:48:25,190 --> 01:48:27,570
you found him out with your skills.

1454
01:48:27,790 --> 01:48:29,790
And we made you kill him.

1455
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:34,180
You turned out to be
much better a mole than we assumed.

1456
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,560
We thought Umarani Das was dead.
But you found her too!

1457
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:40,370
We instructed you.

1458
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:42,660
You killed her.

1459
01:48:43,330 --> 01:48:46,490
You've transformed homicide into an art.

1460
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,700
How many… people have I killed?

1461
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:52,540
You are a legend.

1462
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:58,430
You should be awarded a Nobel
for homicide. At least 50 by now?

1463
01:48:58,520 --> 01:48:59,520
52 people.

1464
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:03,600
Look, I opened up to you
because you're very important to us.

1465
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:07,100
Your contribution
to Project Morpheus is immense.

1466
01:49:08,590 --> 01:49:11,490
You were screaming for freewill eh?
You deserve freewill!

1467
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:15,430
Project Morpheus is done testing you.
Your brain now belongs to you.

1468
01:49:16,970 --> 01:49:20,130
You can begin anew.
Go back to Murshidabad.

1469
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,760
I forgot to tell you though…

1470
01:49:22,230 --> 01:49:24,300
Your aunt passed away a year ago. Sorry.

1471
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:26,530
(sobs)

1472
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:29,630
Anyway, don't worry about income.

1473
01:49:30,860 --> 01:49:32,530
Everything is on us.

1474
01:49:33,970 --> 01:49:36,220
You've helped us create a better tomorrow.

1475
01:49:36,930 --> 01:49:38,060
(continues to sob)

1476
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,100
I don't have anywhere to go.

1477
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:49,630
I can't believe myself anymore.

1478
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:50,960
Who am I?

1479
01:49:53,590 --> 01:49:57,320
I'm not good at anything else
but detection jobs.

1480
01:49:57,410 --> 01:49:59,930
I don't like doing anything else.

1481
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:03,280
I…

1482
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:15,360
Is this my own thought?

1483
01:50:16,330 --> 01:50:19,500
Are you tampering with my brain again?

1484
01:50:28,550 --> 01:50:30,500
Why are you doing this?

1485
01:50:33,530 --> 01:50:39,760
You know very well, if I want…
I can kill all of you in 20 seconds.

1486
01:50:41,830 --> 01:50:43,340
Then why...

1487
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,120
Make me forget everything.

1488
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:52,240
You're making me sad now.

1489
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:54,940
Give me a hug.

1490
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:10,250
So be it.

1491
01:51:27,910 --> 01:51:29,430
Goodbye. (beeps)

1492
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:34,930
(digital voice muffles)
Deleting memory.
