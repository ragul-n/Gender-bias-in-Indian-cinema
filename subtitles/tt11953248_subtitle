1
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:16,677
I had never expected my life
would turn out like this.

2
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:18,554
Everything was going well.

3
00:00:18,674 --> 00:00:21,345
A good husband, two
beautiful children.

4
00:00:21,596 --> 00:00:24,501
But tobacco ruined
everything.

5
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:28,583
The cancer which is spreading has to
be cut off from my face and taken.

6
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:31,481
Nothing would be the same
henceforth.

7
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:34,361
Tobacco has ruined my life.

8
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:37,908
Khaini, Gutka, Tobacco, Zarda
Pan masala.

9
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:39,912
Will ruin your life.

10
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:44,172
At times we think what could
be the result of smoking cigarettes.

11
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:46,437
As a result of this
if I get a stroke

12
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:48,844
will I become a burden
to my family?

13
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,329
Will I get lung cancer.

14
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:52,723
Can cigarette cause
mouth cancer.

15
00:00:52,843 --> 00:00:55,560
Can it cause heart disease
or emphysema?

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,152
Next time when you smoke
bidi or cigarette,

17
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:01,517
ask yourself what could be
the result of smoking.

18
00:01:01,637 --> 00:01:02,978
Quit smoking today.

19
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:06,626
For helpline call
1 800 11 2356

20
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:09,941
Also give missed call
to 011 2290171.

21
00:01:13,695 --> 00:01:17,768
"Keep your silence"

22
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:21,426
"Keep your distance"

23
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:23,745
"You better stay away"

24
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:27,364
"Oh, your better off this way"

25
00:01:27,835 --> 00:01:30,125
"You won't believe"

26
00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:32,961
"the things that"

27
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:38,814
"I've been through,
so you better stay away"

28
00:01:39,243 --> 00:01:44,378
"Hell knows, you're better
off this way"

29
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:49,796
"Don't see"

30
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:53,539
"Don't feel."

31
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,564
"Don't be."

32
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,235
"believing the scheming
demon"

33
00:01:59,422 --> 00:02:01,186
"in me!"

34
00:02:01,306 --> 00:02:05,130
"Don't see."

35
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,701
"Don't feel."

36
00:02:09,316 --> 00:02:12,603
"Don't be redeeming"

37
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:15,363
"the screaming demon in me"

38
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:18,912
"I said oh stay away"

39
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:23,077
"You're better off this way"

40
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:25,885
"Oh, you won't believe in your"

41
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:27,789
"wildest dreaming"

42
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:30,569
"the games that I have
had to play"

43
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:33,392
"But I'll keep on trying"

44
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,087
"Keep on fighting till
one day I am lying"

45
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:39,024
"below and I'll"

46
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,960
"keep denying, keep
from dying"

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,578
"There's only one way
to know."

48
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:54,068
"You see."

49
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:57,788
"You feel."

50
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:00,920
"Oh please."

51
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,856
"Believe in the bleeding
demon in me"

52
00:03:06,123 --> 00:03:09,390
"You see."

53
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:12,239
"You feel."

54
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:16,008
"I need."

55
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:18,688
"Redeeming the screaming demon"

56
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:21,396
"in me"

57
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,133
Sit, sit down.

58
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:15,915
Sit, you sit down.
We just dropped in.

59
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:18,681
Sit down.

60
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:25,285
It's departments vehicle.

61
00:04:26,264 --> 00:04:29,206
It was lying empty
near that Manjalpathe road.

62
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:32,863
I looked around but
didn't find anyone.

63
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:35,902
It is departments
vehicle, right?

64
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:38,214
To hand it over to the
department itself,

65
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,099
we came.

66
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:56,798
Where is your

67
00:04:58,013 --> 00:04:59,466
SI is not to be seen?

68
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:04,625
Birthday?

69
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,862
Remember the place we
got the vehicle, right?

70
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:11,634
Near Manjalpathe.

71
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:04,922
What is it? Do you know?

72
00:06:12,135 --> 00:06:13,860
Hello!

73
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,415
Yes, it's Brahmayya.

74
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,416
Ah.

75
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,165
I got the transfer to

76
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:26,656
Mangalore, Pandeshwara station.

77
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:28,550
Guards!

78
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,188
When they said the vehicle
was found near Manjalpathe,

79
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:33,826
it was known where, what
has to be searched for.

80
00:06:33,906 --> 00:06:34,842
Search!

81
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:37,457
The whole Pandeshwara
station had run to Manjalpathe.

82
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,085
Taking an ambulance along
with them.

83
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:43,311
Search!

84
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:50,141
Sir!
Sir, sir, come here.

85
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:52,453
Sir!

86
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:04,224
SI wasn't dead.

87
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:06,233
They hadn't killed him.

88
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,067
They means those two.

89
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,887
Hari and Shiva.

90
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:30,739
To save one

91
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:33,825
the other one.

92
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:01,655
In other place, if anyone touches
the department's person,

93
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:05,706
in half an hour the department
would track them down.

94
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,054
If not even before that
they would have left the place.

95
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:11,938
But here

96
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:21,237
Hari was taking bath in Kadari to

97
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:22,950
cleanse himself
the very next morning.

98
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:28,379
Any crime he does to cleanse
himself

99
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:29,976
he would come to Kadari.

100
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:36,230
The other one

101
00:08:36,678 --> 00:08:38,091
will play cricket with children.

102
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:40,364
You're hitting the air,
watch the ball.

103
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:44,884
You played so well.

104
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:47,120
I will play, you go.
- I will play.

105
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,819
I will win and come.
- I know how you will win.

106
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:51,176
Should you go always in everything.
- I know what to do, you move.

107
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:53,068
He comes in between everything,
my fate.

108
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:54,189
As if he is some big deal.

109
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:56,006
Throw the ball, throw the ball.
We must take the runs.

110
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,615
If you ask where is this
Hari from,

111
00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:00,556
everyone knows.

112
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,832
He is from Mangaladevi.

113
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:08,843
If asked where is this
Shiva from,

114
00:09:09,343 --> 00:09:12,316
not an answer but
a story will come instead.

115
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:25,450
Who is he, from where he came

116
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:27,602
it's all a story.

117
00:09:28,364 --> 00:09:29,570
A strange story.

118
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:26,086
Pour some water.

119
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:49,996
Water.

120
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:51,135
Water.

121
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:53,201
Water.

122
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:54,788
Water.

123
00:13:55,097 --> 00:13:56,901
Water.

124
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:59,219
Water.

125
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,450
Water.

126
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,887
Water.

127
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,550
Water.

128
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:06,064
Water.

129
00:14:20,522 --> 00:14:21,920
The boy survived.

130
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,981
That boy was of strange
behavior.

131
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:29,382
Any girls or women go
near him

132
00:14:30,046 --> 00:14:31,901
he used to scream like
he is about to die.

133
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:34,873
Everyone started to build
a story behind it.

134
00:14:37,272 --> 00:14:39,268
He was with his mother.

135
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:42,102
She had a connection with
some lorry driver.

136
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:45,604
To elope with that person,
she threw him and went.

137
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:48,543
That's why he started
to fear women.

138
00:14:49,927 --> 00:14:51,563
Stories per head.

139
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:20,465
Being in hospital for
23 days,

140
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,341
he came out.

141
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,891
Went somewhere and wore
a ladies slipper

142
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:27,669
and roamed around the
whole of Mangalore.

143
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,580
From here to bottom nothing
has happened it seems.

144
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,208
But from here to top,
can't even look at it.

145
00:15:32,288 --> 00:15:33,413
What?

146
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:37,121
A woman's dead body from
Railwaypette.

147
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:39,319
When asked they said, she
was hit by train.

148
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:41,489
Will the train go over only
the head?

149
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:43,756
No?

150
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:45,636
It has gone it seems.

151
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:49,561
They don't seem to be from
this place, they had bags in hand.

152
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:14,411
What are you doing here?

153
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,607
What are you doing?

154
00:17:19,214 --> 00:17:20,434
Lift up your head and see.

155
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:22,171
Don't you have name?
What's your name?

156
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,096
Come home.

157
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:32,313
If I again see you like this roaming
around in streets,

158
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:33,900
I will break your legs.

159
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,571
Go and bring him.

160
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:05,133
What's your name?

161
00:18:05,978 --> 00:18:07,287
Shiva.

162
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,963
Hey come, come and play
with us.

163
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,007
Come Putta, can't you hear?

164
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:26,186
Come bro, can't you hear me talking?

165
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:28,117
Throw the ball,
let me teach him to play.

166
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:30,823
Do you know how it is
played?

167
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,947
I will throw the ball
at you.

168
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:34,559
When I throw, you must run.

169
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:38,006
If you don't run, I will throw
again and again. Throw, throw.

170
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:40,633
Give the ball, give the ball.
You will be beaten again.

171
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,998
Throw, throw, throw again.
- Pick up the ball.

172
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:44,709
Give the ball, give the ball.

173
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:46,415
Throw again.

174
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:48,084
Throw faster.

175
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:10,000
All possible people tortured him.

176
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,652
He didn't react for anyone.

177
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,340
No need Vasu, why?
- Give it, just do as I say.

178
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:42,937
What's your name?

179
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:45,125
He told around ten times,
it's Shiva.

180
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:46,653
This beggar doesn't
have mouth to speak?

181
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:48,739
Who knows.
- You light, light it.

182
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:49,792
No need Vasu.

183
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:51,354
Just light it.
- No need.

184
00:19:51,434 --> 00:19:53,655
We will tattoo that you
are Shiva, okay.

185
00:19:55,118 --> 00:19:57,269
Light it.
- Do whatever.

186
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:59,801
Don't act too smart, just do
as I say. Light it.

187
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,091
Look at his face.

188
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:06,418
No need Vasu, why are you
doing it, leave.

189
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,861
Light it.

190
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:35,065
But when he reacted the
first time.

191
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:37,744
The whole of Mangalore
got to know who he is.

192
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:40,592
That day was August 13th.

193
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,379
2008.

194
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:48,791
How many in total?
- 10 is enough, brother.

195
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:49,999
Why only 10, take 20.

196
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,787
No need, brother.
It will get spoiled.

197
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:54,124
No, it won't get spoiled. Give 20.
- No need, brother, no need.

198
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:55,717
Just take it, nothing
will happen.

199
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,990
No need brother.

200
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,999
Take this biscuit.

201
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,658
Hari wanted to live.

202
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:05,229
He wanted to something big
and be known as big person.

203
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,630
He had everything needed
for that.

204
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,562
If it remains then give
it back.

205
00:21:10,397 --> 00:21:12,587
Bhaskar! Bhaskar!

206
00:21:13,076 --> 00:21:14,622
Take these snacks inside.

207
00:21:16,914 --> 00:21:18,851
Brother, 2400.

208
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:21,396
Next time, give all the bills
together, okay.

209
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:23,003
Need the payment in cash
this time, brother.

210
00:21:23,193 --> 00:21:24,399
The last times is also
pending.

211
00:21:24,703 --> 00:21:26,438
Where will we run off to?
Will give, wait.

212
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:27,870
Settle it off now.

213
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,775
What? To whom are you
talking to?

214
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:34,806
Do you know what you're
talking?

215
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:36,368
Do you know whose bar is this?

216
00:21:37,084 --> 00:21:39,629
Whosoever the bar belongs to,
give my payment, that's enough.

217
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:41,293
What?

218
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:43,792
What? What did you say?
What?

219
00:21:44,577 --> 00:21:46,040
So what to whom the bar
belongs to.

220
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,023
What did you say after?

221
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:49,426
You need the payment,
that's it right?

222
00:21:49,546 --> 00:21:50,997
I will settle it off to you
right away.

223
00:22:16,756 --> 00:22:18,823
Despicable fellow, you need
settlement?

224
00:22:19,365 --> 00:22:20,694
Go, they will settle it.

225
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,893
What is it?

226
00:23:02,972 --> 00:23:04,647
Tell what?

227
00:23:12,677 --> 00:23:14,615
What do you need?

228
00:23:16,682 --> 00:23:18,633
Payment was pending, I asked.

229
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,057
Money.

230
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,863
I have to give you.

231
00:23:26,218 --> 00:23:28,362
Right? Right?

232
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:41,952
How much?

233
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:45,564
Tell.

234
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,536
Tell.

235
00:23:56,738 --> 00:23:58,316
2400.

236
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,391
Have to give 2400.

237
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:07,634
If I won't give?

238
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,214
Huh?

239
00:24:20,035 --> 00:24:21,494
Talk to me.

240
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:25,100
It's earned money.

241
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:31,575
Despicable fellow!

242
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:33,332
Whom are you talking to?

243
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:35,063
What are you talking?

244
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:37,346
Earned money? So, is ours
not earned money?

245
00:24:37,897 --> 00:24:40,360
Huh? Talk to me, why are
you not able to talk now?

246
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,147
You spoke there, talk now.

247
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:14,284
Hmm.

248
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:22,722
"To the Almighty Shiva
beloved of Parvathi,"

249
00:25:22,963 --> 00:25:28,856
"Salutations to him who has
the moon around his hair lock"

250
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:35,637
"wearing the skin of tiger as
his dress and holding the bow"

251
00:25:35,757 --> 00:25:41,117
"wearing the skin of tiger as
his dress and holding the bow"

252
00:25:41,305 --> 00:25:47,152
"Holding the river goddess
Ganga on his hair"

253
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:50,122
"Controlling the speed of
the flow through his hair"

254
00:25:50,242 --> 00:25:52,685
"wearing the skin of elephant"

255
00:25:52,937 --> 00:25:59,256
"To the Almighty Shiva
beloved of Parvathi,"

256
00:25:59,463 --> 00:26:05,144
"Salutations to him who has
the moon around his hair lock"

257
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:08,964
Did he beat him up because
he showed Gun to Hari?

258
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:12,454
No. He had beaten everyone
on that day.

259
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:16,447
Till then whomever he was not able
to beat, he had beaten them all.

260
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,148
From that day, Shiva made
it a habit.

261
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:43,868
Whomever he beats, whomever
he kills,

262
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:46,394
he used to wear their slippers
and walk around.

263
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:51,599
"Wearing Rudraksh
necklace in the neck"

264
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:59,025
"you're the greatest
devotee of Shri Vishnu"

265
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:04,973
"You are the dearest friend
Shri Vishnu"

266
00:27:05,093 --> 00:27:11,832
"who flies on eagle
as his vehicle"

267
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,750
That day he killed rowdy Shetru
MA Kere Dayananda.

268
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,888
He had beaten him up
so badly that,

269
00:27:22,235 --> 00:27:24,473
they had to collect all the
17 teeth from the ground.

270
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:38,760
Go in.

271
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,739
Hari brother.

272
00:27:57,956 --> 00:27:59,878
Brother, I am Shekar.

273
00:28:00,682 --> 00:28:02,536
In Mavanahalli Devi I sell
the flowers.

274
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:04,206
I know, tell me.

275
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,483
The temple's people are asking
to open the shop.

276
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:09,419
I came to ask your
permission.

277
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:12,423
Sir.

278
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:16,660
Hari brother, talk fast.

279
00:28:24,006 --> 00:28:26,790
Hello! 'First time I was
getting respect in life.'

280
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,478
Yes, true.
'A little more itself.'

281
00:28:28,598 --> 00:28:30,906
There's some flower shop
it seems.

282
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,080
It's our people.

283
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,091
Okay.

284
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,595
He won't open.
- You can keep the phone.

285
00:28:40,606 --> 00:28:42,326
If you need anything,
make a phone call.

286
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:45,211
Bye!
'Got the phone.'

287
00:28:45,617 --> 00:28:47,755
And the clarity as to in which
way I have to walk as well.

288
00:28:48,128 --> 00:28:50,067
Got a new member along too.

289
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,934
One, one, one, one.

290
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:57,052
It's one, one, one.
Two, two, two.

291
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,227
Two four, two four, two four.

292
00:28:59,546 --> 00:29:00,834
Two and half, two and half.

293
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:02,054
Three for once.

294
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,971
Three, three, three.
- Four.

295
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:05,578
Four, four, four, four.
- Four and quarter.

296
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:07,113
Four and quarter, four and quarter.
- Four and half.

297
00:29:07,233 --> 00:29:08,731
Four and half, four and half.

298
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:11,101
4.70 once, 4.70 once.
- Five.

299
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,765
Five, five, five, five.

300
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,419
Five, five, five, five.

301
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:16,439
Five for once, five for once.

302
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:17,603
Six, six, six.

303
00:29:17,773 --> 00:29:19,239
From Chit fund dealers
in Mangala Devi

304
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,990
till the ones who
watches over footwear,

305
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,270
everyone had to give
one share.

306
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:27,099
Before coming out Hari had made
as much money needed for bail.

307
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:31,757
With the remaining he brought
a second handle vehicle for Shiva.

308
00:29:33,013 --> 00:29:34,797
For 10 months and 17 days,

309
00:29:35,592 --> 00:29:37,061
they both came out.

310
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:38,541
- How many teams has been
registered already

311
00:29:38,621 --> 00:29:39,946
8 teams.
- 8 teams are there?

312
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:40,995
Many more will come, right?

313
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:42,304
They will.
- Okay, okay.

314
00:29:42,424 --> 00:29:44,060
The arrangements must be
perfect.

315
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:45,441
Okay?
- Look there.

316
00:29:46,214 --> 00:29:47,580
Stop him. Stop.

317
00:29:47,754 --> 00:29:49,197
Hey stop.

318
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:51,943
Stop. Come, come.

319
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:54,437
Come.

320
00:29:55,776 --> 00:29:58,058
What? Does this road
belong to you?

321
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,990
No.
- Then?

322
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,998
Despicable fellow!
Are you acting?

323
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:07,028
In front of whom are you
acting?

324
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,533
Go and tell those useless
fellows,

325
00:30:08,718 --> 00:30:10,291
once brother's match is over,
he will get

326
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:12,048
inside Mangala Devi
and beat them up.

327
00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:16,333
Will you tell?

328
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:18,415
Huh? Go.

329
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:20,878
Go!

330
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:23,032
Despicable fellow!
- He is a manager

331
00:30:23,263 --> 00:30:24,707
of the drama company.

332
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,027
When is the match?

333
00:30:33,363 --> 00:30:34,635
In two days.

334
00:30:35,908 --> 00:30:37,979
Has it been a year since
that despicable fellow died?

335
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:42,719
Don't go out for the
next three days.

336
00:30:44,703 --> 00:30:47,336
They said they will come here,
right? Let them come, we'll see.

337
00:30:55,307 --> 00:30:58,097
It had been a year since
MA Giri Dayananda died.

338
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:01,787
His gang had arranged for a
match in his memorial.

339
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,921
Before that could end,

340
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:06,781
they were telling all that
they would kill Hari and Shiva.

341
00:31:06,996 --> 00:31:09,270
Are they there? Okay,
come let's go there.

342
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:11,568
'By evening'
Has the vehicle come?

343
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:13,969
'in whose ears it shouldn't
have fallen,' When?

344
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,036
it had fallen in those ears.

345
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:18,457
Write down the names.

346
00:31:19,013 --> 00:31:21,203
Huh, don't forget.

347
00:31:23,388 --> 00:31:24,842
Hey Hari!

348
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:26,478
Come.
- Where?

349
00:31:26,598 --> 00:31:27,940
I said come.
- Have got work.

350
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:30,362
I said come, I will tell
you, come here.

351
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,067
Sit down.
- To where?

352
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,761
Sit, I'll tell you.

353
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,564
Okay wait, let me wear
my shirt.

354
00:31:42,627 --> 00:31:44,166
Come soon.

355
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:49,593
You touched Shekar
brother's body?

356
00:32:49,773 --> 00:32:51,596
Did you dare to touch Shekar
brother's body? - Shiva, Shiva!

357
00:32:51,716 --> 00:32:53,924
Don't you know who he is?
- Shiva, Shiva, Shiva.

358
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:55,325
Shiva, Shiva, Shiva.
- I really don't know.

359
00:32:55,526 --> 00:32:57,201
I swear I don't know.

360
00:32:57,473 --> 00:32:58,695
We have come here
for work, isn't it?

361
00:32:58,815 --> 00:33:00,576
Why do you need all this in the place
you have come to work? Where is he?

362
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:01,816
I have come only for work,
I really don't know.

363
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,068
He has come for work, he don't know.

364
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,280
Shiva!
- Ask him to come despicable fellow!

365
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,351
It's not worth, come Shiva.
- Leave, leave.

366
00:33:07,471 --> 00:33:09,474
Leave. Just come.
- Leave, leave me once.

367
00:33:09,594 --> 00:33:11,163
Leave me, I will just talk.

368
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:13,569
Despicable fellow, what's your
match fees?

369
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:14,949
- What's your match fee,
despicable fellow?

370
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:16,122
450.

371
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,789
Give me 450.
- I didn't bring money.

372
00:33:19,392 --> 00:33:21,603
Brother, it's okay you can
give day after tomorrow.

373
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:23,787
Then write down. Write down
as Mangal Devi team.

374
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:25,941
Our team must play the
first match, understood?

375
00:33:26,435 --> 00:33:28,168
Tell to this despicable fellow.
- Write it down.

376
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:31,926
Brother, shall I write Mangal
Devi cricketers?

377
00:33:32,046 --> 00:33:33,626
It will look nice.
- Okay write.

378
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:35,651
Some fellow told he would
come to Mangal Devi and kill us.

379
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:37,335
Ask him to come on that day
and kill us.

380
00:33:38,897 --> 00:33:40,778
Whose team are you in
despicable fellow?

381
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,849
Which team?
- Come, come.

382
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:47,175
In a cricket tournament
done for person's memorial,

383
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:49,594
if the person who killed
him was playing the first match

384
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,836
only the ones with strong nerves had
come to watch cricket on that day.

385
00:33:57,048 --> 00:33:59,837
Nominations are happening.
This time,

386
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:02,606
the captain of the Mangala
Devi cricketers

387
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,929
Shiva Mangal Devi and the same way
opposite team's captain Ashwin

388
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:08,126
are competing.

389
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:11,469
Toss.
- Lucky toss win

390
00:34:11,688 --> 00:34:13,606
is won by the Mangala Devi
cricket team.

391
00:34:13,686 --> 00:34:14,854
I can play.

392
00:34:15,365 --> 00:34:17,033
Will anyone play in our team?

393
00:34:17,246 --> 00:34:19,448
I will play.

394
00:34:19,828 --> 00:34:21,348
Give your name.

395
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:23,415
Name.
- Kishore Kumar.

396
00:34:24,549 --> 00:34:26,075
Kishore.

397
00:34:27,054 --> 00:34:29,740
Kishore Kumar. Kumar.
- Kumar.

398
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:33,701
Despicable fellows, none who played
day before yesterday is to be seen.

399
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,522
We will do it here.
I have the knife in my hips.

400
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,999
Let's play. 'The courage they
had while touch Shekar's body'

401
00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:42,833
was not there when Shiva
and Hari came to the ground.

402
00:34:44,024 --> 00:34:47,005
The whole MA Kere team
were hiding on that day.

403
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,353
Shiva is on the batting.

404
00:34:49,473 --> 00:34:52,550
And on the other end Shekar
is to be seen.

405
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:56,631
This time the batting is done
beautifully by Shiva.

406
00:34:57,203 --> 00:34:59,115
Runs are being made.

407
00:35:00,804 --> 00:35:02,009
Run.

408
00:35:03,694 --> 00:35:06,364
New player, Kishore Kumar this time

409
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:09,197
is facing failure one after
the other.

410
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:11,820
He is unable to play.

411
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:15,261
Kishore Kumar in throwing
ball.

412
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:17,637
Why are you doing full toss?
Is that how you ball, despicable.

413
00:35:20,317 --> 00:35:22,171
How many times will he say,
Kishore Kumar, Kishore Kumar?

414
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:24,964
They are making good earnings
because of Kishore Kumar.

415
00:35:25,138 --> 00:35:27,622
Though he faced failure in
batting,

416
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:30,812
even in bowling he is being
a failure.

417
00:35:30,932 --> 00:35:35,269
Mangala Devi cricketers are
facing the failure.

418
00:35:35,485 --> 00:35:37,706
That day Mangala Devi
team lost the match.

419
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:40,086
But the MA Kere area

420
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:41,992
won easily.

421
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,964
That was the day the Mangala
Devi gang was born.

422
00:35:46,773 --> 00:35:48,483
When they came there were
three of them.

423
00:35:49,117 --> 00:35:51,796
While going they were
six of them.

424
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:03,338
Will you take and go, brother?

425
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:05,779
If you don't pay the loan,
what can I do?

426
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,469
Bank guys will ask us.

427
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,428
I should do something, right?
- Are the bank guys your father.

428
00:36:11,187 --> 00:36:12,390
Or are you born for the
interest?

429
00:36:15,937 --> 00:36:18,101
I don't think the talk is
going good.

430
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:20,760
What will you do?

431
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:22,828
If you are born to your father, take

432
00:36:22,908 --> 00:36:24,730
one vehicle from here and go,
let's see.

433
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,304
If you are born to your father, take

434
00:36:42,384 --> 00:36:44,240
one vehicle from here and go,
let's see.

435
00:36:54,683 --> 00:36:59,656
"A line of poetry written forever"

436
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:04,795
"Boggy rain water"

437
00:37:05,026 --> 00:37:09,921
"Village paths, the blowing wind"

438
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:15,160
"Is telling a subtle story"

439
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:20,384
"Hundreds of unnamed
sips of emotion"

440
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:25,401
"Beloved compilation"

441
00:37:25,521 --> 00:37:30,530
"A line of poetry written forever"

442
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:35,666
"Boggy rain water"

443
00:37:35,972 --> 00:37:40,666
"Village paths, the blowing wind"

444
00:37:40,786 --> 00:37:46,004
"Joining your love"

445
00:37:46,205 --> 00:37:50,890
"Pain in the chest is honey
He was without experience"

446
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:56,299
"The affection you give the bee
is the love"

447
00:37:56,419 --> 00:38:01,356
"The roots inside the earth,
without drinking the water"

448
00:38:01,557 --> 00:38:06,959
"Saving for the leaflet, that
sacrifice is the love"

449
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,324
Who did it?

450
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,031
What?

451
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,523
Who broke the cable dish?

452
00:38:21,488 --> 00:38:22,987
Where are you from?

453
00:38:23,745 --> 00:38:25,038
Huh?

454
00:38:25,774 --> 00:38:26,845
Where do you live?

455
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,122
You don't know to talk,
despicable fellow?

456
00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:31,693
Koyalakugli.

457
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:33,727
I have made room for you

458
00:38:33,807 --> 00:38:34,703
so that you sit and
roam for no reason?

459
00:38:34,783 --> 00:38:35,693
Sommanna, let it go.

460
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:37,826
Everyone is watching.
- Send him away, send him away.

461
00:38:37,946 --> 00:38:39,409
You go. Go.
- Go man, Go.

462
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,309
Go!

463
00:38:49,098 --> 00:38:51,092
We will see them, once
we know who they are.

464
00:38:56,304 --> 00:38:57,630
Brother, have you got
cable?

465
00:38:57,842 --> 00:39:00,174
Yes, we have got Hari brother's.
- Do you have now?

466
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,409
They said it's down because
of the wind.

467
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:05,352
It did not fall for the wind,
we made it fall.

468
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,457
If you need cable, let us know.
- Okay, okay.

469
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:14,384
Brother!
- That's ours as well.

470
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:17,882
Sister!
- Cable, cable.

471
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,744
Call us if you need cable.

472
00:39:25,353 --> 00:39:27,077
Is he the Prakash
from here?

473
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:29,790
It's his number.

474
00:39:30,338 --> 00:39:32,862
He has distributed pamphlets
everywhere.

475
00:39:33,925 --> 00:39:35,747
He has told everyone.

476
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,848
That he was the one who
cut off our cable.

477
00:39:39,637 --> 00:39:41,409
Despicable fellow.

478
00:39:46,683 --> 00:39:48,905
When is it?

479
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:04,527
Dassera in Mangalore means
Tiger's disguise.

480
00:40:10,738 --> 00:40:13,366
That year Hari's team was
also doing the Tiger.

481
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,075
Move it a little towards
this side.

482
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,579
Tie it at the bottom.

483
00:40:34,436 --> 00:40:37,140
Tie it tightly, yes yes it's
correctly, leave it there.

484
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,227
Tie it tightly.

485
00:40:39,485 --> 00:40:41,396
A little binding in the
behind.

486
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:43,880
No one is receiving the phone,
what's wrong with them?

487
00:40:44,313 --> 00:40:45,708
Kishore, Kishore,
this side.

488
00:40:46,404 --> 00:40:47,863
Srishanth.

489
00:40:48,568 --> 00:40:49,841
Tie tightly.

490
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:52,783
Yes uncle.

491
00:40:53,138 --> 00:40:55,591
No one is receiving the phone,
you go and check once.

492
00:40:56,189 --> 00:40:59,723
Okay. Devanigere, tie it tightly.
Kishore, come come.

493
00:41:01,046 --> 00:41:02,456
Raj sir, I will go and come.

494
00:41:14,846 --> 00:41:17,190
I am taking it in with
15 tigers, don't they know?

495
00:41:18,593 --> 00:41:20,252
Vikram.
- Yes, brother.

496
00:41:20,624 --> 00:41:23,020
Prakash was doing this Tiger
for past 18 years.

497
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,463
Did you call them?

498
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:27,096
Hari and Shiva used to
climb up.

499
00:41:27,216 --> 00:41:30,089
Prakash who was ruling
Mangalore for 18 years,

500
00:41:30,677 --> 00:41:33,315
thinking to put some fear in them,
he broke the dish antenna.

501
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,705
Hey go, you line up next
for painting.

502
00:41:57,309 --> 00:41:59,557
Prakash won't do mine.
- Go man.

503
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,107
But they were not the ones
who used to fear.

504
00:42:06,867 --> 00:42:08,696
He threw stones at their
cable.

505
00:42:09,257 --> 00:42:10,823
For revenge

506
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,665
they brought in Tigers
the same year.

507
00:42:16,728 --> 00:42:19,446
All those who used to be
Tigers in Prakash's group,

508
00:42:20,032 --> 00:42:22,337
they all had come to
Hari's group this year.

509
00:42:23,464 --> 00:42:25,041
They had brought them.

510
00:42:46,514 --> 00:42:48,904
They brought in Tiger's
disguise to make Prakash jealous.

511
00:42:49,357 --> 00:42:51,680
To make him more jealous

512
00:42:52,104 --> 00:42:53,536
they did one more thing.

513
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:56,915
In Mangalore Tiger
disguise blessing started.

514
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:59,331
Now it's become the prestige.

515
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,682
Every gang will put in
a tiger each.

516
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:04,907
Those tigers will calculate and
go to 20 wealthy houses.

517
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:07,643
Those houses must throw
money at the tigers.

518
00:43:08,265 --> 00:43:09,760
In lakhs.

519
00:43:10,775 --> 00:43:13,232
Prakash had a permanent
15 to 20 houses.

520
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,959
Hari took the list of
those houses.

521
00:43:19,437 --> 00:43:20,653
Do it faster, it's getting late.

522
00:43:20,773 --> 00:43:22,384
Hari's tigers went to
all those houses.

523
00:43:22,504 --> 00:43:23,759
Come ahead.
- Kids are there.

524
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:25,176
Before Prakash.

525
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:26,681
Slowly.

526
00:43:26,877 --> 00:43:28,382
Come soon.

527
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,128
Come soon, soon.
Shekar soon.

528
00:43:31,718 --> 00:43:34,197
Jump quickly, quick.

529
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:36,286
Listen.

530
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:38,867
Prakash's tigers come here,
it will be a problem for us.

531
00:43:38,987 --> 00:43:40,933
Oh, Prakash will not come.
He is dead.

532
00:43:41,108 --> 00:43:43,128
Come, come, come soon.
Quickly.

533
00:43:43,813 --> 00:43:45,373
Coming Hari brother.

534
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:17,902
Brother, there are many here.

535
00:44:18,366 --> 00:44:20,041
Seems like lot of people
are there for the Pooja.

536
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:25,927
Honor them.

537
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:28,310
Make garlands and put it
on these despicable fellows.

538
00:45:42,738 --> 00:45:44,475
If Prakash brother comes
give this one to him, okay.

539
00:45:44,882 --> 00:45:47,389
So sad, this time his tigers
didn't get even a single garland.

540
00:45:47,572 --> 00:45:48,726
At least let five rupees fall
on them.

541
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:51,204
I will go then.
- Okay.

542
00:46:16,352 --> 00:46:18,057
It was raining during
Dasera that year.

543
00:46:19,164 --> 00:46:20,597
Everyone knew.

544
00:46:21,282 --> 00:46:22,807
Along with 4 drops of rain

545
00:46:23,729 --> 00:46:26,171
4 drops of blood also will
spill that year.

546
00:46:28,227 --> 00:46:31,447
The next day of Dasera before the
tigers would take off their colors,

547
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,893
as a final token they must dance
in front of Mangala Devi once.

548
00:46:35,801 --> 00:46:38,126
Prakash's tigers were coming
from one side.

549
00:46:39,034 --> 00:46:41,443
And on the other side, Hari's.

550
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:36,918
Why did you stop?

551
00:48:37,753 --> 00:48:40,051
Beat it, it was good.

552
00:48:42,134 --> 00:48:43,514
Beat the drums.

553
00:48:50,377 --> 00:48:51,660
Hey Prashanthu!

554
00:48:55,937 --> 00:48:57,437
Last year with us.

555
00:48:58,529 --> 00:48:59,848
This year a different team?

556
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,256
Ah come, greetings.

557
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:12,893
Made good amount of money, right?

558
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:15,863
Even I wanted to give some
money.

559
00:49:16,385 --> 00:49:18,665
Ramnatha, bring that bag.

560
00:49:35,548 --> 00:49:37,255
Pick up.

561
00:49:38,414 --> 00:49:40,572
Pick up, it's my money.

562
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,895
Pick up.

563
00:49:44,379 --> 00:49:46,157
Pick up, despicable fellows,
pick it up.

564
00:49:47,993 --> 00:49:49,616
You pick.

565
00:49:51,091 --> 00:49:52,701
You came just yesterday

566
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,342
and you're a tiger?

567
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:57,184
Pick up.

568
00:49:57,963 --> 00:49:59,869
Are you so great?
- What?

569
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,549
What is it?

570
00:50:01,994 --> 00:50:03,988
Come. Come, come.

571
00:50:06,013 --> 00:50:07,288
Come, come, come.

572
00:50:07,476 --> 00:50:09,223
Hey let him go. Come.

573
00:50:09,656 --> 00:50:11,382
Come, come, I said come.

574
00:50:11,743 --> 00:50:14,467
Come, come, come.

575
00:50:42,845 --> 00:50:46,213
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

576
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,575
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

577
00:50:49,695 --> 00:50:52,782
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

578
00:50:52,955 --> 00:50:56,092
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

579
00:50:56,212 --> 00:50:59,382
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

580
00:50:59,502 --> 00:51:02,886
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

581
00:51:03,006 --> 00:51:06,100
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

582
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,565
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"
Beat the drums.

583
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,723
Beat as loud as possible.

584
00:51:16,018 --> 00:51:17,796
Will you beat or should I.

585
00:51:22,886 --> 00:51:26,230
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

586
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:29,554
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

587
00:51:29,674 --> 00:51:32,903
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

588
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:36,226
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

589
00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:39,606
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

590
00:51:39,726 --> 00:51:42,911
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

591
00:51:43,111 --> 00:51:46,170
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

592
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:49,500
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

593
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:56,015
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

594
00:51:56,443 --> 00:52:03,141
"And a beautiful garland of vilva
leaves, O Mahadeva"

595
00:52:03,342 --> 00:52:09,533
"A beautiful garland of Vilva
and Tulsi leaves"

596
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:14,484
"I came to
your worship"

597
00:52:14,604 --> 00:52:16,215
"O Mahadeva"

598
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:20,570
"I offer various types
of jasmine flowers"

599
00:52:20,828 --> 00:52:28,001
"By placing them upon your
head, O Mahadeva"

600
00:52:29,474 --> 00:52:36,187
"I offer various types
of jasmine flowers"

601
00:52:36,379 --> 00:52:41,323
"By placing them upon your
head, O Mahadeva"

602
00:52:56,409 --> 00:52:59,566
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

603
00:52:59,732 --> 00:53:02,905
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

604
00:53:03,025 --> 00:53:06,276
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

605
00:53:06,396 --> 00:53:10,079
"Mahadeva, Mahadeva"

606
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:15,772
What is it, Shekar?
How is it going in Mangala Devi?

607
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:18,963
After the case, these two became
the celebrities in Mangala Devi.

608
00:53:19,139 --> 00:53:21,956
To meet them new guys used
to come to jail.

609
00:53:22,076 --> 00:53:24,125
Our known boys.

610
00:53:24,347 --> 00:53:26,851
He is Savi and he is
Jithu.

611
00:53:27,347 --> 00:53:30,099
They stay near Mangala Devi.
- Where in Mangala Devi?

612
00:53:30,299 --> 00:53:31,484
Nijaplatthe.

613
00:53:31,649 --> 00:53:33,988
What do you do?
- I work in the center.

614
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:36,884
They want to work with us.

615
00:53:37,004 --> 00:53:39,387
Is it so? Give them some
work in the cable.

616
00:53:39,927 --> 00:53:41,498
Won't you do?
- Yes, we will do.

617
00:54:02,014 --> 00:54:04,791
Brother.
- Oh yes, greetings brother.

618
00:54:05,113 --> 00:54:07,386
Come inside.
- It's okay, no problem.

619
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:12,507
This is our Sushanth.
- I have seen. Will you take tea?

620
00:54:12,675 --> 00:54:15,174
Shekar.
- No, I drank tea and came.

621
00:54:16,874 --> 00:54:19,589
Then what's the matter?
- Nothing.

622
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,582
All this happened.

623
00:54:22,278 --> 00:54:23,984
So, want to drop out of
everything.

624
00:54:24,308 --> 00:54:27,749
You too know very well.
We didn't do it on purpose. He.

625
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:32,258
They were trying to take us off.
To survive we had beat them back.

626
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:35,536
Yes, yes, so we just want to
stop it, that's all.

627
00:54:39,766 --> 00:54:41,502
That's all?
- Yes, that's all.

628
00:54:42,455 --> 00:54:43,805
We'll leave then.

629
00:54:46,031 --> 00:54:48,057
But we must inform you once,
right Hari brother.

630
00:54:48,177 --> 00:54:50,134
People will talk otherwise.

631
00:54:50,478 --> 00:54:53,796
That we did this and that
behind you guys.

632
00:54:54,353 --> 00:54:57,244
That's why and also because
if something happens to you.

633
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,377
it will come back on us then.

634
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:01,628
That's why to clear off
everything,

635
00:55:01,793 --> 00:55:03,843
to solve everything,
I came to say.

636
00:55:05,652 --> 00:55:07,821
That's all, brother.
I will go now.

637
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,027
Break, yes slowly.

638
00:55:25,732 --> 00:55:27,038
Start.

639
00:55:28,649 --> 00:55:30,615
Why is this vehicle
stopping off?

640
00:55:39,057 --> 00:55:40,819
What vehicle have you brought?

641
00:55:41,889 --> 00:55:43,903
Put the gear.

642
00:55:45,289 --> 00:55:47,880
The gears are like stone,
it isn't moving only.

643
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:52,114
Huh, what to do now?

644
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,024
Now change the gear and go,
raise the accelerator and move.

645
00:55:57,585 --> 00:55:59,208
Give the accelerator slowly.

646
00:56:01,267 --> 00:56:02,653
Go.

647
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:07,277
Slow, slow, slow.

648
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,699
It's not turning.

649
00:56:13,968 --> 00:56:16,215
What old vehicle
have you brought?

650
00:56:16,421 --> 00:56:18,688
I told you to bring a new
vehicle.

651
00:56:18,979 --> 00:56:20,920
Do it properly, put the
clutch.

652
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,378
Your vehicle should be
good to do it right.

653
00:56:25,342 --> 00:56:27,499
Oh, what is this man.
- What noise is this?

654
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:28,749
Is this the only speed
it has got?

655
00:56:28,974 --> 00:56:31,550
Put clutch and go.
Change the gear.

656
00:56:31,776 --> 00:56:35,202
Clutch is not going in,
how will I change?

657
00:56:36,691 --> 00:56:37,945
Stomp the clutch properly.

658
00:56:38,025 --> 00:56:39,600
What to stomp clutch,
this is all it works.

659
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:46,134
You cannot do it.

660
00:56:46,314 --> 00:56:48,332
No need, I have two days to learn,
I will do it.

661
00:56:48,452 --> 00:56:49,858
I will learn, I don't need
your vehicle.

662
00:56:49,978 --> 00:56:52,109
I don't need your vehicle.
- Very good, very good.

663
00:56:52,229 --> 00:56:54,942
Why do you say like this?

664
00:56:55,547 --> 00:56:57,536
You don't know to do it.
- The vehicle doesn't move at all.

665
00:56:57,656 --> 00:56:59,782
If you don't know to drive,
what can I do?

666
00:57:23,695 --> 00:57:25,318
I told him in the morning,

667
00:57:26,084 --> 00:57:27,771
don't take the vehicle and
go, Sushanth.

668
00:57:30,802 --> 00:57:32,598
I cannot look at him.

669
00:57:34,769 --> 00:57:36,888
The vehicle has got
crushed.

670
00:57:39,632 --> 00:57:40,991
He went in full speed.

671
00:57:41,937 --> 00:57:43,547
That opposite guy also
came in full speed.

672
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:46,207
He hit him very badly
and went.

673
00:57:57,301 --> 00:57:59,016
I cannot look at him.

674
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:03,724
He has been broken into
pieces, he is not our Sushanth.

675
00:58:08,196 --> 00:58:10,761
So many pieces of him
were not found too.

676
00:58:22,434 --> 00:58:23,526
Did you find his slipper?

677
00:59:16,171 --> 00:59:17,426
Who gave the bribe?

678
00:59:21,353 --> 00:59:22,350
Hmm?

679
00:59:23,537 --> 00:59:25,812
Looking at your face when you
came home, I got to know.

680
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:28,115
Who gave him the bribe
to kill?

681
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,200
Don't you know to speak?

682
00:59:33,272 --> 00:59:34,391
Who gave the bribe?

683
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:40,699
Bobbehani.

684
00:59:49,992 --> 00:59:51,393
Did he take it?

685
00:59:53,124 --> 00:59:54,216
Hmm.

686
00:59:57,148 --> 00:59:58,575
Tell Bobbe,

687
00:59:59,285 --> 01:00:00,510
to that despicable fellow

688
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:04,805
He is from Mangalore
and you can't even pluck his hair.

689
01:00:08,954 --> 01:00:11,810
Throw this on his chest on
behalf of me.

690
01:00:14,982 --> 01:00:17,107
I will leave now.

691
01:00:36,496 --> 01:00:38,956
Have any other songs?
- Yes, shall I play?

692
01:00:39,343 --> 01:00:40,869
Play devotional song.

693
01:00:48,592 --> 01:00:50,420
Go towards Kathari side.

694
01:00:53,627 --> 01:00:55,350
Do you have things to
take bath?

695
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:57,843
No.
- Stop near the shop and buy.

696
01:01:00,294 --> 01:01:01,765
Stop the vehicle in the side.

697
01:01:31,384 --> 01:01:33,279
Brother, take the jasmine.
- No need, go.

698
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:35,765
No, he asked me to
give it to you. Take.

699
01:01:36,353 --> 01:01:37,315
No need, go.

700
01:01:37,435 --> 01:01:39,339
No, he asked me to give you.
- Who?

701
01:01:39,577 --> 01:01:41,505
Someone Mumbai's father.

702
01:01:41,943 --> 01:01:43,813
Where is he?
- He left.

703
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:45,200
He asked me to give this to you.

704
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,527
Also, he told you not
to go to Kathari for temple.

705
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,832
You must go to Mangal Devi it seems.

706
01:01:48,952 --> 01:01:51,477
And send the vehicle to Kathari.

707
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,270
Don't talk like fool, go.

708
01:01:53,903 --> 01:01:55,070
Jasmine?

709
01:01:55,459 --> 01:01:56,659
Get lost.

710
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:12,047
'Someone Mumbai's father.'

711
01:02:23,321 --> 01:02:25,652
Shiva, come. Come.
Where?

712
01:02:27,616 --> 01:02:28,885
Where?

713
01:02:29,005 --> 01:02:30,368
You go. You go to Kathari.

714
01:02:36,101 --> 01:02:38,504
To where?
- Come, I will tell you.

715
01:02:43,478 --> 01:02:44,941
Brother, to Mangala Devi?

716
01:02:45,888 --> 01:02:47,005
Come sit.

717
01:03:43,794 --> 01:03:45,101
Hello!

718
01:03:45,805 --> 01:03:47,083
Where?

719
01:03:52,321 --> 01:03:53,615
Go to Kathari.

720
01:04:54,185 --> 01:04:56,081
Greetings, Levaraja's uncle.

721
01:04:56,353 --> 01:04:57,597
Come.

722
01:04:58,874 --> 01:05:01,582
'Welcome to all the children
present here'

723
01:05:01,702 --> 01:05:03,687
[The guests will be distributing
books to the students]

724
01:05:03,807 --> 01:05:06,127
'That's the reason we have all
gathered here'

725
01:05:06,247 --> 01:05:09,782
'Honoring our invitation
the honorable guests have arrived'

726
01:05:09,902 --> 01:05:13,589
'Our beloved MLA Chethav Vasudev'

727
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:16,323
'we heartily invite them. Also'

728
01:05:36,312 --> 01:05:38,826
'We all speak a lot about humanity'

729
01:05:38,946 --> 01:05:40,552
'Not just us everyone speaks'

730
01:05:46,638 --> 01:05:48,289
How are you?

731
01:05:49,836 --> 01:05:51,479
I am alive.

732
01:05:54,461 --> 01:05:57,922
Good for you. Why do you
have the urgency to die?

733
01:05:59,462 --> 01:06:01,059
Another died instead.

734
01:06:02,027 --> 01:06:03,521
You escaped, right? That's enough.

735
01:06:04,557 --> 01:06:06,422
What do you want?

736
01:06:07,153 --> 01:06:08,781
You saved me, so what do you want?

737
01:06:11,871 --> 01:06:14,282
Are you any different?
God?

738
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:17,361
What do you want it seems.

739
01:06:21,426 --> 01:06:23,028
I am Raviraj.

740
01:06:24,336 --> 01:06:26,103
I was abroad for many years.

741
01:06:26,763 --> 01:06:28,308
Now I want to settle down here.

742
01:06:28,972 --> 01:06:31,913
I know, I saw you once in Dubai.

743
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,102
Oh, you know.

744
01:06:41,201 --> 01:06:42,375
If you know so much,

745
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:45,746
there is one who don't like me here,
tell me who is it.

746
01:06:46,285 --> 01:06:48,692
If you're this good,
no body will like you.

747
01:06:50,867 --> 01:06:52,099
That's also true.

748
01:06:55,231 --> 01:06:57,700
But still there is one who doesn't
like me at all. Tell me who that is.

749
01:07:01,647 --> 01:07:03,588
The one who is sitting in the last,
wearing white shirt.

750
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:13,200
MLA

751
01:07:15,829 --> 01:07:17,206
Tell why doesn't he like me?

752
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:19,171
A different party, is that why?

753
01:07:20,643 --> 01:07:22,057
Same party, that's why.

754
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,897
He is afraid that MLA
would give me the seat next.

755
01:07:31,556 --> 01:07:33,290
Hey no need Swami.

756
01:07:33,447 --> 01:07:35,095
How many times will I give, no need.

757
01:07:35,449 --> 01:07:37,543
No need, let him give this time.

758
01:07:38,066 --> 01:07:40,262
He is Hari.
It's Hari, announce.

759
01:07:41,108 --> 01:07:43,020
'Hari must distribute'

760
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:44,793
'school bags and'

761
01:07:44,966 --> 01:07:47,802
'books to the students'

762
01:07:48,775 --> 01:07:50,208
It's time, we have to leave.

763
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:54,498
'Unexpectedly our chairman'

764
01:07:54,618 --> 01:07:56,460
'has to leave. From our school'

765
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:58,656
'let's honor and send him off'

766
01:07:59,587 --> 01:08:02,043
He started off one by one
thinking I will become the MLA.

767
01:08:04,054 --> 01:08:05,999
He has got a dog in the department.

768
01:08:07,256 --> 01:08:08,630
A SI.

769
01:08:09,726 --> 01:08:13,686
Keeping him in hand,
he is raiding all my place.

770
01:08:14,687 --> 01:08:16,801
I can get that dog
transferred anytime I want.

771
01:08:18,103 --> 01:08:19,640
But no need.

772
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:21,466
Fear must be on his back.

773
01:08:22,356 --> 01:08:23,781
Do so much and give.

774
01:08:24,753 --> 01:08:27,428
I will solve your problem by
talking to the Mumbai guy.

775
01:08:33,589 --> 01:08:34,875
What should I do?

776
01:08:43,644 --> 01:08:45,164
Where?

777
01:08:45,395 --> 01:08:47,216
Sir, there is a shortcut here, sir.

778
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:48,934
Let's go from there.

779
01:09:09,114 --> 01:09:10,338
One minute I will be back.

780
01:09:11,236 --> 01:09:12,320
One minute.

781
01:09:37,201 --> 01:09:38,246
Beat him.

782
01:09:49,068 --> 01:09:52,141
Not necessary that big things
must happen for the life to change.

783
01:09:53,666 --> 01:09:55,966
That night my life
too would have changed.

784
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:58,687
But that day.

785
01:09:59,033 --> 01:10:00,376
I didn't realize that as well.

786
01:10:08,515 --> 01:10:10,467
Hello!
- Hello, when will you come?

787
01:10:11,584 --> 01:10:14,620
I cannot come. I have come to
Hasan, Home Minister also have come.

788
01:10:14,789 --> 01:10:17,155
She will not have food without
you it seems, you must come.

789
01:10:18,092 --> 01:10:20,822
Hello! I cannot come, understand.

790
01:10:20,942 --> 01:10:22,486
You only tell her.

791
01:10:24,032 --> 01:10:25,273
Hello!
- Who is it? Father.

792
01:10:25,393 --> 01:10:26,545
Hello!

793
01:10:26,665 --> 01:10:28,610
Hello Chinni.
- Hello father.

794
01:10:29,063 --> 01:10:31,296
When will you come?
- I will come dear.

795
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:33,299
I will finish duty and come.
- No need.

796
01:10:33,419 --> 01:10:34,840
Come and eat dinner
with me, please.

797
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,205
Till you come, I won't
eat food.

798
01:10:37,325 --> 01:10:39,402
I have officers around me.

799
01:10:39,522 --> 01:10:41,232
I will call you later.
- No need, you come.

800
01:10:41,352 --> 01:10:43,972
They say program will start
on time.

801
01:10:44,557 --> 01:10:46,263
They will say anything.

802
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:49,300
You eat food, I will come and.
- Hey!

803
01:10:49,502 --> 01:10:51,129
When you're on duty why are you
on the phone?

804
01:10:51,209 --> 01:10:52,018
Sir, sorry.

805
01:10:52,098 --> 01:10:53,775
It will be a risk
for Minister's security.

806
01:10:53,855 --> 01:10:54,929
Keep quiet.
- Sorry sir.

807
01:10:55,443 --> 01:10:58,548
What is it?
- Sorry sir, I didn't know.

808
01:10:58,739 --> 01:11:00,434
My child was crying.

809
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:02,062
It's okay.

810
01:11:02,294 --> 01:11:03,834
Sorry sir.
- It's okay.

811
01:11:05,055 --> 01:11:06,595
You must first give time
for the family.

812
01:11:07,172 --> 01:11:10,299
Look at us, we keep roaming
around cities in the name of work.

813
01:11:10,602 --> 01:11:12,256
We won't remember our house
road itself.

814
01:11:16,127 --> 01:11:17,750
Never mind.
- Sir.

815
01:11:17,966 --> 01:11:19,234
Good night.

816
01:11:25,796 --> 01:11:28,496
Sir, Mangalore MLA had called.

817
01:11:28,887 --> 01:11:32,750
They are asking to put a strong
SI to that Pandeshwara station.

818
01:11:33,095 --> 01:11:35,558
The current SI has some problem.
- Put this guy.

819
01:11:35,844 --> 01:11:38,703
Brahmayya, put him.

820
01:11:39,193 --> 01:11:41,934
Looks like he is a little
courageous, let's use him.

821
01:11:43,936 --> 01:11:47,299
That's it, I got transferred to
Mangalore.

822
01:11:56,188 --> 01:11:59,427
Before I could step into Mangalore,
the whole place knew about me.

823
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:02,151
The whole city was talking.

824
01:12:02,441 --> 01:12:05,551
That I have come here to finish
Hari and Shiva.

825
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:12,769
They too welcomed me pretty
grandly.

826
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:40,716
Beloved Brahmayya,

827
01:12:40,796 --> 01:12:43,328
we are glad you're
coming from Hassan to Mangalore.

828
01:12:43,534 --> 01:12:46,059
Your wife Veena,

829
01:12:46,179 --> 01:12:48,789
is a teacher in Government school
in Shettyhalli.

830
01:12:48,909 --> 01:12:51,159
Last November only she got
permanent.

831
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:55,151
Your son Sampath, 5th grade
Central school, Shettyhalli.

832
01:12:55,377 --> 01:12:57,083
And your youngest daughter,
Samyatha.

833
01:12:57,276 --> 01:12:59,878
is studying in first grade in
the same school.

834
01:13:00,193 --> 01:13:04,663
We are aware of it, praying
for their health and lifespan.

835
01:13:04,783 --> 01:13:07,245
We will fill you with so much love

836
01:13:07,365 --> 01:13:09,383
that you will not feel that you're
away from them all.

837
01:13:09,595 --> 01:13:11,733
Welcome to Mangala Devi.

838
01:13:11,933 --> 01:13:15,165
Yours Hari and Shiva.

839
01:14:03,796 --> 01:14:05,913
Sir.

840
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:07,418
Have to meet MLA sir.

841
01:14:08,789 --> 01:14:10,296
Yes, yes.

842
01:14:10,599 --> 01:14:12,833
Yes, local corporate.

843
01:14:12,953 --> 01:14:14,523
I am busy a little.

844
01:14:14,643 --> 01:14:15,766
Okay.

845
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:19,754
Tell me what is it?
- Need to talk to sir.

846
01:14:20,644 --> 01:14:22,121
He is in meeting, a little busy.

847
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:25,044
I have come from
Pandeshwara station, sir.

848
01:14:25,531 --> 01:14:26,685
Oho, from Pandeshwara.

849
01:14:26,805 --> 01:14:28,490
Come, come, come sir.

850
01:14:28,856 --> 01:14:29,835
Sir, people are there.

851
01:14:29,955 --> 01:14:31,514
It's okay, come sir.

852
01:14:43,673 --> 01:14:45,270
They speak always about it.

853
01:14:45,533 --> 01:14:47,171
But what's the point.

854
01:14:48,237 --> 01:14:49,499
Okay.

855
01:14:50,045 --> 01:14:53,661
There's nothing I can do.

856
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,871
SI from Pandeshwara station.

857
01:14:56,036 --> 01:14:58,396
How are you?
- I am good, sir.

858
01:14:58,684 --> 01:15:00,919
Sit.

859
01:15:04,361 --> 01:15:05,942
Sit down.

860
01:15:06,582 --> 01:15:08,472
Thank you, sir.
- How is the work going on?

861
01:15:08,592 --> 01:15:10,775
It's okay sir.
- Our Pandeshwara station.

862
01:15:10,986 --> 01:15:13,016
You know right? Yeah.

863
01:15:13,278 --> 01:15:14,769
He is coming from there.

864
01:15:16,066 --> 01:15:18,194
Will you take tea?
- No need sir.

865
01:15:19,518 --> 01:15:21,380
Tell me, what's the matter?

866
01:15:22,874 --> 01:15:24,306
Sir.

867
01:15:25,281 --> 01:15:27,333
I need to talk to you
personally, sir.

868
01:15:27,453 --> 01:15:28,868
Yes, tell me.

869
01:15:34,498 --> 01:15:36,414
Oh, they are all our people only.

870
01:15:36,836 --> 01:15:39,531
No need to take tension.
About that matter right?

871
01:15:40,557 --> 01:15:43,199
Tell, tell. He is shy
as you all are here.

872
01:15:44,548 --> 01:15:45,924
Sir.
- Tell.

873
01:15:46,234 --> 01:15:48,463
I don't like to involve
in this, sir.

874
01:15:50,519 --> 01:15:52,023
In which one?

875
01:15:53,542 --> 01:15:56,798
I just reported yesterday sir.

876
01:15:57,559 --> 01:15:59,532
By then they have already
given threatening to my family.

877
01:15:59,612 --> 01:16:00,414
what is this sir?

878
01:16:00,494 --> 01:16:02,320
Are you not a police?
- Sir.

879
01:16:03,482 --> 01:16:04,204
Are you not a police?

880
01:16:10,768 --> 01:16:12,845
I am asking you.

881
01:16:13,264 --> 01:16:15,474
But sir, I.
- Are you not a police?

882
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:18,752
Are you not a police?

883
01:16:20,133 --> 01:16:23,193
Then? Why are you sitting
in front of me and crying?

884
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,072
He is telling, right?

885
01:16:28,362 --> 01:16:29,805
Put him in and beat him up.

886
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:33,777
Sir, I don't need all this.
Take me off and give transfer.

887
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,665
I don't like to involve in your
personal problem, sir.

888
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:41,171
Give me a transfer sir.

889
01:16:47,137 --> 01:16:49,295
Come. Come in.

890
01:16:49,415 --> 01:16:50,980
Sir.

891
01:16:52,356 --> 01:16:54,680
I will give you transfer.
What do you need?

892
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,411
You need transfer?
- Sir.

893
01:16:56,531 --> 01:16:58,173
Huh, you need transfer?
- Sir.

894
01:16:58,293 --> 01:17:00,687
If you get scared and

895
01:17:00,807 --> 01:17:03,247
run from here, my respect will
be hindered, you dog.

896
01:17:03,428 --> 01:17:05,978
It's my respect that will
be hindered.

897
01:17:06,245 --> 01:17:08,115
Huh, go and kill them.

898
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,954
Or you only die. Go.

899
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:08,142
How much did you give for this?

900
01:18:08,435 --> 01:18:10,005
For which?
- This one.

901
01:18:10,173 --> 01:18:11,298
For dog?

902
01:18:11,418 --> 01:18:12,669
I got it freely.

903
01:18:12,789 --> 01:18:14,969
My friend gave me when
he shifted.

904
01:18:16,554 --> 01:18:17,888
How much does it cost?

905
01:18:18,217 --> 01:18:20,746
Maybe around 15,000.

906
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:23,142
For a dog?

907
01:18:23,327 --> 01:18:24,929
That's a very good breed.

908
01:18:25,094 --> 01:18:27,026
Once it's big, no
one will come near me.

909
01:18:27,361 --> 01:18:29,210
So, even we can't come
near you?

910
01:18:29,694 --> 01:18:32,924
You come man, it's your house.
Who will stop you?

911
01:18:53,509 --> 01:18:58,568
"God who gives everything too"

912
01:18:58,688 --> 01:19:03,565
"He will make God too lose,
with his love"

913
01:19:03,685 --> 01:19:09,135
"The world seen around"

914
01:19:09,255 --> 01:19:13,868
"he will cover it amazingly"

915
01:19:14,055 --> 01:19:16,461
"The fate of love"

916
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:22,065
"if you take it off like this"

917
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:24,250
When will you give the money?
- In four days.

918
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:26,233
Huh?
- In four days.

919
01:19:26,353 --> 01:19:28,268
Fixed right.

920
01:19:30,471 --> 01:19:34,573
"What to do? Written forever"

921
01:19:34,799 --> 01:19:37,123
"The poetry line."

922
01:19:37,243 --> 01:19:39,801
"The boggy"

923
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:42,402
"Rain water"

924
01:19:42,522 --> 01:19:44,810
"Village paths"

925
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:47,214
"The blowing wind"

926
01:19:47,334 --> 01:19:50,994
"Is telling a subtle story"

927
01:19:51,114 --> 01:19:52,706
Why did you beat him up?

928
01:19:52,887 --> 01:19:57,851
"Hundreds of unnamed
sips of emotion"

929
01:19:57,971 --> 01:20:02,901
"Beloved compilation"

930
01:20:03,094 --> 01:20:04,903
"Written forever"

931
01:20:05,142 --> 01:20:08,844
"A line of poetry. Boggy" Why
does he hit everyone? Don't know.

932
01:20:08,964 --> 01:20:14,195
"Rain water"

933
01:20:17,904 --> 01:20:21,742
I think it's good if you keep
him away.

934
01:20:24,343 --> 01:20:26,172
They gave bus timing work
for Shiva.

935
01:20:26,971 --> 01:20:29,937
Should make the bus come
at the right time.

936
01:20:30,678 --> 01:20:32,379
Should stop the bus, if it
comes early.

937
01:20:33,107 --> 01:20:34,484
Should beat them up, if it
comes late.

938
01:20:34,604 --> 01:20:37,176
Seven minutes late, when asked
they are scolding so badly.

939
01:20:37,485 --> 01:20:38,824
You go and tell him.

940
01:20:44,109 --> 01:20:46,674
Brother, that's not the bus.
This is the one.

941
01:21:13,129 --> 01:21:14,623
Stop ahead, it might bite.

942
01:21:14,814 --> 01:21:16,524
Enough enough.
Despicable dog.

943
01:21:37,587 --> 01:21:38,939
Hey go aside.

944
01:21:39,372 --> 01:21:41,107
Go aside, go aside.

945
01:21:41,284 --> 01:21:44,028
If no one would have stopped, that
conductor would not have survived.

946
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:49,192
- Sir.

947
01:21:49,272 --> 01:21:50,892
Start the vehicle.
- To where, sir?

948
01:21:51,227 --> 01:21:52,732
To commissioner's house.

949
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,588
So, you don't want to reconsider.
- No sir.

950
01:22:06,561 --> 01:22:08,319
Why resignation?
- Sir, please sir.

951
01:22:09,761 --> 01:22:11,832
You yourself no, I am not
able to.

952
01:22:12,708 --> 01:22:14,315
Please accept it, sir.

953
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:18,818
Okay.

954
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:21,116
Take 3 to 4 days time.

955
01:22:23,197 --> 01:22:24,794
Then give a formal letter.

956
01:22:26,292 --> 01:22:28,147
Take tea.
- Thank you, sir.

957
01:22:38,542 --> 01:22:40,474
Hari brother.

958
01:22:40,948 --> 01:22:43,143
I have come to SI's house.

959
01:22:45,177 --> 01:22:46,578
To commissioner's house.

960
01:22:49,446 --> 01:22:52,110
Yes, he is here in the spot.

961
01:22:54,304 --> 01:22:59,135
What is it sir? Don't know what
he spoke, I am standing aside.

962
01:22:59,909 --> 01:23:01,573
Huh.

963
01:23:01,938 --> 01:23:04,689
Yes, don't know if he is trying
to make the case strong.

964
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:07,022
Hmm.

965
01:23:07,207 --> 01:23:09,474
What should I do?

966
01:23:09,649 --> 01:23:12,421
It's good to give a strong
warning.

967
01:23:13,369 --> 01:23:15,867
Isn't it? Yes, correct.

968
01:23:17,155 --> 01:23:19,148
I will call, I will call.

969
01:23:19,808 --> 01:23:21,160
Alright.

970
01:23:21,584 --> 01:23:23,117
Yes, yes that's right.

971
01:23:23,867 --> 01:23:25,054
Hmm, hmm.

972
01:23:26,071 --> 01:23:27,880
Okay, let's see how it goes.

973
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,404
Okay, okay.

974
01:23:29,598 --> 01:23:31,102
I will come tomorrow.

975
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:32,738
I will call you then.

976
01:23:33,051 --> 01:23:34,683
Oh, okay sir.

977
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:37,111
Go.

978
01:24:59,805 --> 01:25:01,943
Go try to talk to commissioner
once again.

979
01:25:02,684 --> 01:25:05,440
I have sent you a doll this time,
but next time.

980
01:25:59,503 --> 01:26:00,697
Sir, where to sir?

981
01:26:06,735 --> 01:26:08,290
Sir, to station?

982
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,145
Straight.

983
01:26:43,009 --> 01:26:44,498
Stop here.

984
01:27:50,779 --> 01:27:51,863
Get down.

985
01:27:52,344 --> 01:27:53,696
Sir.
- Get down, get down.

986
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:02,998
Sir, that.

987
01:28:03,856 --> 01:28:05,635
Don't beat, sir.

988
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:07,366
Sir! Sir!

989
01:28:07,585 --> 01:28:09,118
Sir!

990
01:28:09,287 --> 01:28:10,915
No sir.

991
01:28:11,372 --> 01:28:13,713
Sir!
- You will chop my son's head?

992
01:28:13,894 --> 01:28:15,834
No, no sir.

993
01:28:16,395 --> 01:28:18,217
If I go to commissioner's
office again,

994
01:28:18,337 --> 01:28:20,092
what will you do?

995
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:21,723
What will you do? What will.
- Sir.

996
01:28:21,843 --> 01:28:23,025
Sir, it's not me sir.

997
01:28:23,145 --> 01:28:24,850
It's not me, sir.
It's Hari brother.

998
01:28:25,489 --> 01:28:26,968
Your Hari brother also will go.

999
01:28:27,479 --> 01:28:29,264
He will die from my hands only.
- Sir.

1000
01:28:29,437 --> 01:28:31,324
Before that... Before that.
- Sir.

1001
01:28:31,444 --> 01:28:32,543
You fool... You.
- Sir, sir.

1002
01:28:32,663 --> 01:28:34,015
I will finish you off first.
- Sir, sir.

1003
01:28:34,135 --> 01:28:35,890
Forgive me sir, mistake sir.

1004
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:37,560
Sir, I will not do that again, sir.

1005
01:28:37,733 --> 01:28:39,373
My family.

1006
01:28:39,493 --> 01:28:41,924
My family.

1007
01:28:42,044 --> 01:28:44,186
My family.
- Sir, sir.

1008
01:28:44,372 --> 01:28:46,126
Sir, I will not do that again, sir.

1009
01:28:46,246 --> 01:28:47,870
I won't do sir.
- You must do.

1010
01:28:49,242 --> 01:28:50,380
You must work for me.

1011
01:28:51,375 --> 01:28:52,503
Work for me.

1012
01:28:55,269 --> 01:28:56,484
Those dogs will go.

1013
01:28:57,937 --> 01:29:00,575
Dogs will go.

1014
01:29:02,753 --> 01:29:05,442
If you go against me,
you idiot.

1015
01:29:06,437 --> 01:29:07,493
You too will not survive.

1016
01:29:08,209 --> 01:29:09,605
Okay?

1017
01:29:10,733 --> 01:29:12,057
Me too.

1018
01:29:12,696 --> 01:29:14,240
My family.

1019
01:29:44,485 --> 01:29:46,517
Drink water, sir.

1020
01:29:46,637 --> 01:29:49,200
I will not do like that sir.
You drink water.

1021
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,799
You must do.

1022
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:55,274
Drink water sir.

1023
01:29:56,675 --> 01:29:58,138
Sir.

1024
01:30:16,447 --> 01:30:18,084
Around 2000 people might
have gone, right?

1025
01:30:19,118 --> 01:30:21,513
No, afternoon it was 2500.

1026
01:30:23,038 --> 01:30:25,074
In that around 400 plates more
might have gone.

1027
01:30:26,168 --> 01:30:28,886
Afternoon food got over and we
ordered 400 extra plates.

1028
01:30:33,575 --> 01:30:36,186
Awesome bro, nice house you've made.

1029
01:30:37,005 --> 01:30:38,292
Did nicely as it had to be done.

1030
01:30:42,806 --> 01:30:44,419
Food is good, right?

1031
01:30:44,774 --> 01:30:46,016
Hari brother.

1032
01:30:47,742 --> 01:30:49,509
Drinks are over downstairs.

1033
01:30:49,629 --> 01:30:51,132
Got four more extra as you told.

1034
01:30:51,252 --> 01:30:53,218
Where?
- That's all over.

1035
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,676
Are the boys still there?

1036
01:30:54,796 --> 01:30:56,309
Manage somehow, mix water.

1037
01:30:59,925 --> 01:31:01,476
Hari had taken a new house.

1038
01:31:01,733 --> 01:31:03,027
House warming.

1039
01:31:03,147 --> 01:31:05,267
For drinking the elders
were sitting upstairs.

1040
01:31:05,387 --> 01:31:06,906
The youngsters were below.

1041
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:10,938
Shiva was not there that day.

1042
01:31:11,665 --> 01:31:13,906
Conductor case was a
little strong.

1043
01:31:14,026 --> 01:31:16,359
So, they had arranged somewhere
for his hideout.

1044
01:31:43,738 --> 01:31:45,484
What is this?

1045
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:48,451
What are they doing?
- Half an hour more.

1046
01:31:48,683 --> 01:31:51,274
From last half an hour
they are dancing for the same.

1047
01:31:51,394 --> 01:31:53,648
Won't they change it?
- Go and get it changed.

1048
01:31:53,823 --> 01:31:56,080
Will they change?
- Tell the DJ.

1049
01:32:02,043 --> 01:32:03,168
Bro!

1050
01:32:03,366 --> 01:32:04,792
Bro! DJ!

1051
01:32:05,171 --> 01:32:06,703
Hey psychedelic.

1052
01:32:06,823 --> 01:32:08,059
Have you got psychedelic?

1053
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:09,926
Have you got psychedelic?
Psychedelic?

1054
01:32:10,089 --> 01:32:12,598
Have you got trance? Play it.
- Yes.

1055
01:32:12,718 --> 01:32:14,136
After this I will play.

1056
01:32:14,256 --> 01:32:16,593
Play it, bro.
- I will play after this.

1057
01:32:16,713 --> 01:32:18,785
So what just play it,
they are all our guys.

1058
01:32:22,864 --> 01:32:25,031
Despicable, who stopped it?

1059
01:32:25,253 --> 01:32:28,369
Not me, he asked so I changed.
- Who asked to change?

1060
01:32:30,429 --> 01:32:33,510
Change it back to tiger,
play tiger.

1061
01:32:34,030 --> 01:32:36,389
Good. Thanks guru.

1062
01:32:36,509 --> 01:32:38,171
If you change once again.

1063
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:40,789
You will not be there to change.

1064
01:32:40,909 --> 01:32:43,962
You dance, dance.

1065
01:32:48,327 --> 01:32:51,102
What is it?
- If he change, he will be beaten.

1066
01:32:51,222 --> 01:32:54,052
Whoever asks him to change,
even he will get beaten.

1067
01:32:54,226 --> 01:32:56,770
Oh, who said so?

1068
01:32:58,958 --> 01:33:01,457
All those despicable fellows only.

1069
01:33:06,853 --> 01:33:08,517
Hey what is this?

1070
01:33:08,637 --> 01:33:10,510
Can you do this?
Can you?

1071
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:12,138
Place it.

1072
01:33:26,965 --> 01:33:28,465
Hey get up man.

1073
01:33:28,585 --> 01:33:29,585
Hey! Hey!

1074
01:33:29,705 --> 01:33:31,946
Hari brother is calling, come there.
Come.

1075
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:34,660
Hari brother is calling you,
you must come it seems.

1076
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:36,185
Hari brother?
- Yes, come.

1077
01:33:41,471 --> 01:33:43,391
Hey!

1078
01:33:47,286 --> 01:33:49,396
Hari brother, bye.
- Go safely.

1079
01:33:51,832 --> 01:33:53,212
Where is Neethu, brother?

1080
01:33:53,292 --> 01:33:54,286
- Where is Neethu?

1081
01:33:54,366 --> 01:33:56,976
Who knows where
that despicable is? Would be drunk.

1082
01:33:57,864 --> 01:33:59,937
Hari brother, he might be
sleeping inside.

1083
01:34:00,057 --> 01:34:01,668
If he is drunk a lot, make
him sleep here.

1084
01:34:01,841 --> 01:34:03,964
Okay, you go slowly.
Go slowly.

1085
01:34:04,132 --> 01:34:06,407
You ride slowly, okay.
- Give me a call once you reach.

1086
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:15,663
Okay.

1087
01:35:00,797 --> 01:35:02,930
Bhramesh sir, there is an
information.

1088
01:35:08,551 --> 01:35:10,168
Hello, yes tell me.

1089
01:35:10,936 --> 01:35:12,353
What? WHo?

1090
01:35:13,296 --> 01:35:14,635
From which hospital?

1091
01:35:41,713 --> 01:35:43,562
What happened?
- There's no problem now.

1092
01:35:43,682 --> 01:35:45,803
Where is he now?
- They won't let in.

1093
01:35:46,522 --> 01:35:48,459
Who touched Neethu?
- Your guys only, brother.

1094
01:35:48,579 --> 01:35:50,492
Ganesha, levereja brother's
uncle.

1095
01:35:51,094 --> 01:35:52,237
Despicable fellow.

1096
01:35:52,357 --> 01:35:54,117
For what?
- Don't know.

1097
01:36:02,189 --> 01:36:04,409
Hello!
- Where is that idiot fellow?

1098
01:36:04,594 --> 01:36:06,279
Who?
- That Ganesha.

1099
01:36:06,536 --> 01:36:08,262
He didn't come here, why?

1100
01:36:08,382 --> 01:36:10,513
For what did he beat
up Neethu?

1101
01:36:10,817 --> 01:36:12,347
Which Neethu?
- Our boy.

1102
01:36:12,467 --> 01:36:14,607
He is admitted in hospital.
- Which hospital?

1103
01:36:15,468 --> 01:36:18,162
Where is he?
- Where are you now? Tell me.

1104
01:36:18,952 --> 01:36:20,794
Where are you now?
- In hospital.

1105
01:36:21,283 --> 01:36:22,835
Do one thing, come near
my home.

1106
01:36:30,027 --> 01:36:31,407
That Katnayaka Bhasha,

1107
01:36:33,019 --> 01:36:34,266
he is born only to spoil
the respect.

1108
01:36:37,564 --> 01:36:39,295
Let him come home, I will
break his legs.

1109
01:36:39,753 --> 01:36:41,221
Before that, I will break them.

1110
01:36:42,112 --> 01:36:45,311
Hari, you don't touch him.
- Why shouldn't I touch him?

1111
01:36:45,584 --> 01:36:47,506
I said you don't touch him.
It's about my honor.

1112
01:36:47,626 --> 01:36:49,994
What your honor? Who is that dog?
- Listen to what I have to say.

1113
01:36:50,114 --> 01:36:51,145
To touch my boy.

1114
01:36:51,225 --> 01:36:52,696
That despicable
is my brother in law.

1115
01:36:57,002 --> 01:36:58,671
If you touch him, my respect
will be hindered.

1116
01:37:06,724 --> 01:37:08,521
Does Shiva know?

1117
01:37:10,266 --> 01:37:12,416
Does Shiva know?
- No.

1118
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:19,643
I will fall on your leg, please
don't tell that Shiva.

1119
01:37:19,913 --> 01:37:21,742
What is brother,
falling on leg and all.

1120
01:37:21,822 --> 01:37:23,568
I will bring that
despicable tomorrow.

1121
01:37:24,074 --> 01:37:25,037
Should he fall on your leg,

1122
01:37:25,117 --> 01:37:26,405
I will make
him do it. I'll make him say sorry.

1123
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:29,193
But Shiva shouldn't get
to know.

1124
01:37:31,576 --> 01:37:33,263
This shouldn't repeat.

1125
01:37:35,562 --> 01:37:36,959
I swear it will not repeat.

1126
01:37:41,788 --> 01:37:43,570
How much did you give?
- For which one?

1127
01:37:44,299 --> 01:37:45,341
For shoes.

1128
01:37:45,592 --> 01:37:46,767
7k bro.

1129
01:37:47,311 --> 01:37:48,869
There was offer in
the card.

1130
01:37:48,989 --> 01:37:50,635
So got in 7.

1131
01:37:50,755 --> 01:37:52,589
If not, the price of this
was 9.

1132
01:37:52,918 --> 01:37:54,497
For 7, it is superb.

1133
01:37:55,296 --> 01:37:57,883
By the way brother, that
boys case is it compromised?

1134
01:37:58,448 --> 01:37:59,651
Yes.

1135
01:37:59,771 --> 01:38:01,526
Uncle's fate.

1136
01:38:01,901 --> 01:38:03,108
Had to ask sorry in front
of Uncle.

1137
01:38:03,492 --> 01:38:05,144
He believed it, despicable.

1138
01:38:09,692 --> 01:38:10,904
How much is it, brother?

1139
01:38:14,547 --> 01:38:15,783
How much?
- What all did you take?

1140
01:38:15,903 --> 01:38:17,221
Three kings.

1141
01:38:17,341 --> 01:38:18,471
Two chocolate.

1142
01:38:18,668 --> 01:38:20,317
Did you take chewing gum?

1143
01:38:20,594 --> 01:38:22,398
One.
- Two chewing gum.

1144
01:38:25,838 --> 01:38:27,182
74?

1145
01:39:51,890 --> 01:39:53,873
Shiva brother, it was not me
he started it off.

1146
01:39:53,993 --> 01:39:55,388
Shiva brother, not me.
He started it.

1147
01:39:55,508 --> 01:39:58,259
One minute, talk and sort it.

1148
01:39:58,379 --> 01:39:59,853
Hey! Hey!

1149
01:40:13,316 --> 01:40:15,033
That despicable fellow!

1150
01:40:15,153 --> 01:40:17,428
Let me go, send him out.

1151
01:40:17,548 --> 01:40:19,010
How dare you touch my
body?

1152
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:20,762
Despicable.
- Leave, leave him.

1153
01:40:20,947 --> 01:40:23,429
Leave.
- Shiva, what's this. Stop it.

1154
01:40:23,549 --> 01:40:26,062
You don't talk, you don't talk.
- Don't be adamant, Shiva.

1155
01:40:26,237 --> 01:40:27,922
Don't be adamant.
- Shiva brother, what's this drama?

1156
01:40:28,042 --> 01:40:29,390
Hey dog!

1157
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:31,326
Despicable dog, come here.

1158
01:40:31,495 --> 01:40:33,869
One is gone who touch Neethu.

1159
01:40:33,989 --> 01:40:36,148
Next is your uncle and then you.

1160
01:40:36,268 --> 01:40:37,493
Look Hari, if anything happens to

1161
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:38,652
Avinash, that's it.
- What will you do?

1162
01:40:38,732 --> 01:40:40,747
What will you do? Tell what
will you do?

1163
01:40:40,908 --> 01:40:42,947
Hey Putta, take him out.

1164
01:40:43,444 --> 01:40:45,581
Hey go guys.
- Let me go.

1165
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:49,418
Leave! Leave!

1166
01:40:49,855 --> 01:40:51,112
Leave!

1167
01:41:07,462 --> 01:41:09,136
Will you arrange something
now?

1168
01:41:10,037 --> 01:41:11,320
Or should I do?

1169
01:41:20,777 --> 01:41:22,071
Nobody got to know.

1170
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:24,766
How the news reached Shiva.

1171
01:41:25,112 --> 01:41:26,796
Someone made it reach him.
- Neethu.

1172
01:41:27,234 --> 01:41:28,449
Huh?

1173
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:30,622
It's good to say a word to
Shiva brother.

1174
01:41:32,230 --> 01:41:33,372
Hari brother told not to say.

1175
01:41:35,638 --> 01:41:38,271
Then what? After getting hurt
it is direct compromise?

1176
01:41:39,338 --> 01:41:40,711
That's last, sir.

1177
01:41:42,082 --> 01:41:43,574
Let Shivanna beat him up.

1178
01:41:44,237 --> 01:41:45,338
Then we'll compromise.

1179
01:41:45,928 --> 01:41:47,481
What's Shivanna's number?

1180
01:41:55,894 --> 01:41:57,786
Shiva stabbed him and
went to jail.

1181
01:41:58,483 --> 01:42:00,189
For the first time in
his life.

1182
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,155
Alone.

1183
01:42:29,699 --> 01:42:31,766
Six months Shiva didn't
come outside.

1184
01:42:34,470 --> 01:42:36,685
Hari didn't go inside to see him
even once.

1185
01:42:45,154 --> 01:42:47,955
Shekar was trying to get bail
for Shiva.

1186
01:42:50,563 --> 01:42:52,907
Hari was not receiving Shekar's
phone as well.

1187
01:42:56,578 --> 01:42:59,167
No matter how he tried, Hari
was not been able to reach.

1188
01:42:59,904 --> 01:43:01,414
What is it?
- Is Hari brother not at home?

1189
01:43:01,534 --> 01:43:02,939
Hari brother?

1190
01:43:03,639 --> 01:43:05,803
Don't know Shekar brother,
he has gone out somewhere.

1191
01:43:06,611 --> 01:43:08,569
I tired calling him many times,
he is not receiving the call.

1192
01:43:09,893 --> 01:43:11,504
Is it so?

1193
01:43:12,287 --> 01:43:13,668
I will inform him once he come.

1194
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:16,557
Once he come as him to
call me.

1195
01:43:17,325 --> 01:43:19,742
Bye.
- It was calm for 6 months outside.

1196
01:43:20,365 --> 01:43:21,648
It was known.

1197
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:24,136
It was the calmness which comes
before Tsunami.

1198
01:43:29,591 --> 01:43:30,889
I prepared everything.

1199
01:43:31,450 --> 01:43:33,510
Each one of their phones
were tapped.

1200
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:36,076
Hari, Raviraj, Avinash.

1201
01:43:36,267 --> 01:43:37,441
All their phones.

1202
01:43:40,223 --> 01:43:41,660
Send everyone out.

1203
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,675
Will get the bail it seems,
after a month.

1204
01:43:53,795 --> 01:43:55,691
There's no problem here.

1205
01:43:55,865 --> 01:43:57,514
Only thing is they don't put
salt in the porridge, that's it.

1206
01:43:57,713 --> 01:43:59,316
Otherwise there's no
problem.

1207
01:43:59,436 --> 01:44:01,528
Are you feeling bad, Shiva brother?
- For what?

1208
01:44:02,775 --> 01:44:05,037
That Hari didn't come to
see me?

1209
01:44:05,686 --> 01:44:07,417
He might have got other
works to do.

1210
01:44:07,695 --> 01:44:09,926
How is your hand?
- Hand is fine, brother.

1211
01:44:10,046 --> 01:44:11,765
Can play cricket now.

1212
01:44:12,018 --> 01:44:13,914
Don't play cricket
with that ahdn, fool.

1213
01:44:14,455 --> 01:44:17,396
Okay, who plays well now?

1214
01:44:17,886 --> 01:44:19,405
Kishore plays well now.

1215
01:44:20,014 --> 01:44:21,539
That pony tail fellow.

1216
01:44:21,659 --> 01:44:24,053
Is it so? Is he
batsman or bowler?

1217
01:44:24,173 --> 01:44:25,639
He is all rounder.

1218
01:44:25,759 --> 01:44:27,262
The ball will not touch
the ground.

1219
01:44:27,571 --> 01:44:28,977
He plays so much?

1220
01:44:29,462 --> 01:44:32,206
He doesn't play cricket,
no other problems from him.

1221
01:44:33,427 --> 01:44:35,622
Shiva brother, should I throw
fast or slow?

1222
01:44:35,742 --> 01:44:38,502
Just throw, throw.
Don't act too smart.

1223
01:44:38,703 --> 01:44:41,197
I will throw fast then.
- Just throw.

1224
01:44:43,468 --> 01:44:46,013
Oh! Oh! What a batting.

1225
01:44:46,193 --> 01:44:48,233
The wind is blowing.
- Just throw man.

1226
01:44:48,353 --> 01:44:50,217
I was in jail for six months.

1227
01:44:50,557 --> 01:44:52,143
Throw a little slowly, so sad.

1228
01:44:52,263 --> 01:44:54,124
No need, throw fast.
Don't act too much.

1229
01:44:54,204 --> 01:44:56,088
I will throw slowly.
- You just throw, man.

1230
01:44:56,208 --> 01:44:57,634
Look, look, now look.

1231
01:44:58,906 --> 01:45:00,745
See, I hit now despicable fellow.

1232
01:45:01,116 --> 01:45:02,173
I did hit.
- I am in the field.

1233
01:45:02,293 --> 01:45:05,289
No, your father is there.
- Hey don't tease.

1234
01:45:05,409 --> 01:45:07,025
He is fielder it seems.

1235
01:45:07,231 --> 01:45:08,699
First throw the ball.

1236
01:45:14,108 --> 01:45:15,890
Hello, everything is ready.

1237
01:45:16,668 --> 01:45:17,610
Shouldn't miss.

1238
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:19,925
No, everything is
arranged correctly.

1239
01:45:26,552 --> 01:45:28,484
Take it out a little,
what if it comes out?

1240
01:45:28,604 --> 01:45:29,513
Hey Prakyath.

1241
01:45:30,395 --> 01:45:31,735
Hey dog!

1242
01:45:32,081 --> 01:45:33,359
Dig the mud.

1243
01:45:33,479 --> 01:45:34,949
I am tired of digging.

1244
01:45:35,234 --> 01:45:36,891
Can't you do so much?

1245
01:45:37,011 --> 01:45:38,337
Have you left it for
your father?

1246
01:45:38,539 --> 01:45:40,496
Despicable, don't get into
father's matter.

1247
01:45:40,616 --> 01:45:42,615
Yes, yes, your father is
the great Rajnikanth. Take out.

1248
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,556
Avinash had arranged
Vamanjur gang.

1249
01:45:48,161 --> 01:45:49,876
That day in Mangala Devi

1250
01:45:50,073 --> 01:45:52,825
it was the festival of
Maha Kali temple.

1251
01:46:02,195 --> 01:46:03,848
Shiva would be found
alone that day.

1252
01:46:04,492 --> 01:46:06,129
They had fixed time for him
on that day.

1253
01:46:06,855 --> 01:46:09,812
Listen, we will kill that
despicable today.

1254
01:46:10,225 --> 01:46:12,574
Don't make it dirty by doing it
half done. Stay on line.

1255
01:46:13,201 --> 01:46:14,429
Okay, okay.

1256
01:46:18,986 --> 01:46:20,691
He too was waiting for
his death.

1257
01:46:21,851 --> 01:46:23,293
I too was waiting.

1258
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:35,679
Call right away, they have sent
gang to kill Shivu.

1259
01:47:36,227 --> 01:47:37,801
If we inform now, Shiva
might survive.

1260
01:47:38,730 --> 01:47:40,704
Why?
- Call.

1261
01:47:44,408 --> 01:47:46,768
Shekar brother, go to Shiva
brother immediately.

1262
01:47:46,888 --> 01:47:48,339
They have sent people to
kill him.

1263
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:49,909
Who sent?

1264
01:47:50,544 --> 01:47:51,702
Who?

1265
01:48:26,416 --> 01:48:28,619
Hey! Hey!

1266
01:48:28,793 --> 01:48:31,716
Despicable!

1267
01:48:33,415 --> 01:48:35,354
Hey, despicable!

1268
01:48:36,204 --> 01:48:38,123
Stay right there.

1269
01:48:40,583 --> 01:48:42,605
Hey, stop.

1270
01:48:47,512 --> 01:48:49,122
What is it?

1271
01:48:50,153 --> 01:48:53,566
What happened?
- They had sent people to kill you.

1272
01:48:55,176 --> 01:48:57,031
Who sent?

1273
01:48:59,608 --> 01:49:01,173
Who?
- Hari.

1274
01:49:02,171 --> 01:49:04,255
What are you saying?
What are you saying?

1275
01:49:04,335 --> 01:49:06,115
What are you saying?
Why will he send?

1276
01:49:06,195 --> 01:49:07,924
You won't believe, you won't
believe that fellow.

1277
01:49:08,004 --> 01:49:09,229
Why will he send?

1278
01:49:09,309 --> 01:49:11,406
It was he who did it all,
it was he who did it all.

1279
01:49:12,241 --> 01:49:14,146
His head is not right, he is drunk.
- You are our guy, our guy.

1280
01:49:14,266 --> 01:49:15,996
If I would have not got the correct
information, you would have died.

1281
01:49:16,116 --> 01:49:18,783
When did you see him, man?
- Hey I saw him.

1282
01:49:18,984 --> 01:49:20,663
I saw him when you were
in jail.

1283
01:49:20,910 --> 01:49:21,935
I have seen him before you.

1284
01:49:22,055 --> 01:49:23,455
This despicable will get
from my hand, tell him.

1285
01:49:23,575 --> 01:49:25,160
Definitely he will get it.
- Shiva brother.

1286
01:49:25,335 --> 01:49:28,003
To that despicable house,

1287
01:49:28,123 --> 01:49:30,078
I am tired of running to
his house for your bail.

1288
01:49:30,297 --> 01:49:31,991
Ask them.
Tell him.

1289
01:49:32,205 --> 01:49:33,281
Ask him to go, I am being
serious.

1290
01:49:33,401 --> 01:49:34,720
Ask him to go. They gave information.
- Shiva brother.

1291
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,306
They gave information
and told right.

1292
01:49:36,426 --> 01:49:37,521
That's enough for me.

1293
01:49:37,641 --> 01:49:39,880
Ask him to go, ask him to go.
- Shekar brother, Shekar brother.

1294
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,101
Ask him to go.
- I will go man.

1295
01:49:41,221 --> 01:49:42,688
Don't speak like fools.

1296
01:49:42,808 --> 01:49:44,779
No need Shiva brother.

1297
01:49:45,046 --> 01:49:47,143
If they had to kill, they should
have killed him first.

1298
01:49:47,263 --> 01:49:48,936
Hey!
- Shiva brother.

1299
01:49:49,056 --> 01:49:51,527
Who will kill whom?

1300
01:49:51,647 --> 01:49:53,495
Let's see who will kill whom?
- Let it go, Shiva brother.

1301
01:49:53,615 --> 01:49:56,266
Shiva brother.
- Let me go.

1302
01:49:56,462 --> 01:49:59,054
Leave, leave, Shiva brother.
- Let me go.

1303
01:50:00,985 --> 01:50:03,097
Good for nothing, despicable
fellows good for nothing.

1304
01:50:03,288 --> 01:50:04,746
What shall I do if the information
got leaked?

1305
01:50:04,866 --> 01:50:06,389
If you inform the whole place,
what else would happen?

1306
01:50:09,727 --> 01:50:11,148
Can't do one thing rightly.

1307
01:50:16,517 --> 01:50:18,977
If I was quiet that day,
one would have died.

1308
01:50:20,181 --> 01:50:21,871
I wanted both to die.

1309
01:50:29,383 --> 01:50:31,130
Why are you sleeping here?

1310
01:50:32,608 --> 01:50:34,370
What's your problem?
Shut up and sleep.

1311
01:50:45,492 --> 01:50:47,109
I will call him tomorrow.

1312
01:50:50,879 --> 01:50:52,373
And ask who and what it is.

1313
01:50:53,573 --> 01:50:55,263
Shall I?

1314
01:50:55,727 --> 01:50:56,969
Who told you?

1315
01:51:00,153 --> 01:51:01,806
That's why I ask you
when you call.

1316
01:51:01,926 --> 01:51:03,821
Shall I call him directly and ask?

1317
01:51:08,852 --> 01:51:10,648
He won't do it, Shekar.

1318
01:51:16,228 --> 01:51:18,438
What will he do without me, tell?

1319
01:51:20,493 --> 01:51:22,012
Sleep.

1320
01:51:23,852 --> 01:51:28,128
What?
- We just came here.

1321
01:51:28,473 --> 01:51:30,209
We came nearby.

1322
01:51:39,977 --> 01:51:41,883
I told you he won't do it.

1323
01:51:43,395 --> 01:51:44,930
Understood?

1324
01:51:45,528 --> 01:51:47,630
Why will he kill me?

1325
01:51:49,013 --> 01:51:51,149
Why will he kill me, Shekar?

1326
01:51:52,196 --> 01:51:53,607
Hey Shekar?

1327
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:57,130
He won't do anything like that.

1328
01:51:57,548 --> 01:51:59,841
Check properly and speak, Shekar.

1329
01:52:02,664 --> 01:52:04,009
I will ask him.

1330
01:52:04,184 --> 01:52:07,161
Why will he try to kill me?

1331
01:52:08,614 --> 01:52:09,958
Huh?

1332
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:12,803
Shekar.

1333
01:52:32,675 --> 01:52:34,337
What?

1334
01:52:39,124 --> 01:52:41,081
Shiva brother!
Hey Shiva brother!

1335
01:52:41,639 --> 01:52:43,148
Shiva brother!
- What is it?

1336
01:52:43,268 --> 01:52:45,018
They have beaten up our Kishore
and thrown it seems.

1337
01:52:45,138 --> 01:52:46,981
What? What are you
saying?

1338
01:52:48,201 --> 01:52:49,989
Those dogs have chopped
him it seems.

1339
01:52:50,210 --> 01:52:52,008
Is he alive?

1340
01:52:52,812 --> 01:52:54,362
He is alive.

1341
01:52:56,242 --> 01:52:57,767
He is alive.

1342
01:54:23,425 --> 01:54:26,542
Hey tell it to this despicable,
who killed him.

1343
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:30,951
Yesterday Hari brother came
to kill you.

1344
01:54:31,662 --> 01:54:34,269
That's why we went to
kill him.

1345
01:54:35,762 --> 01:54:37,261
But there ten people were there.

1346
01:54:38,771 --> 01:54:40,254
We escaped.

1347
01:54:41,835 --> 01:54:43,051
Kishore got caught.

1348
01:54:43,226 --> 01:54:45,267
Hey tell if Hari was there.

1349
01:54:47,152 --> 01:54:48,743
Hari killed.

1350
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:54,202
Is it our Hari?

1351
01:54:55,186 --> 01:54:58,432
Hey despicable, can't you hear?

1352
01:54:58,607 --> 01:55:01,930
It is Hari who killed,
what more proof do you need?

1353
01:55:09,317 --> 01:55:10,847
Let's go to Kathari.

1354
01:57:42,333 --> 01:57:43,709
Fool where is your Kalash?

1355
01:57:44,138 --> 01:57:46,029
Despicable, send more
people to kill me.

1356
01:57:46,149 --> 01:57:47,348
I will do Kalash every
week then.

1357
01:57:47,468 --> 01:57:49,281
Before that you will die,
I will take you in a week.

1358
01:57:49,401 --> 01:57:50,509
I will kill you even before
that.

1359
01:57:50,677 --> 01:57:51,733
Are you born for your father,

1360
01:57:51,853 --> 01:57:53,104
whom are you cheating?

1361
01:57:53,801 --> 01:57:57,019
If I don't kill you and put a
round in Mangala Devi.

1362
01:57:57,435 --> 01:57:59,483
I am not born for one father.
Start the vehicle.

1363
01:58:14,547 --> 01:58:16,432
Can't believe.

1364
01:58:17,353 --> 01:58:19,079
Despicable, don't know why
he is doing like this.

1365
01:58:50,355 --> 01:58:52,827
Two of them came and surrendered
saying they only murdered.

1366
01:58:54,656 --> 01:58:55,831
They had fixed them.

1367
01:58:56,583 --> 01:58:57,603
Case close.

1368
01:59:01,511 --> 01:59:02,628
Give that.

1369
01:59:02,838 --> 01:59:04,470
Stick, stick.
- Sir.

1370
01:59:04,767 --> 01:59:06,576
Stick, stick, give soon.

1371
01:59:07,302 --> 01:59:08,451
They agreed.

1372
01:59:13,344 --> 01:59:15,174
Sit properly.

1373
01:59:17,302 --> 01:59:18,599
Will you do? Will you do?

1374
01:59:48,368 --> 01:59:49,923
Give a soap.
- Sir?

1375
01:59:50,228 --> 01:59:51,696
Give a bath soap.

1376
01:59:52,695 --> 01:59:54,416
I will get it now sir.

1377
02:00:33,959 --> 02:00:34,886
It was known.

1378
02:00:35,607 --> 02:00:37,581
Shortly everything would end.

1379
02:00:38,458 --> 02:00:39,826
Just had to listen here.

1380
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:41,779
And had to inform it
elsewhere.

1381
02:00:42,195 --> 02:00:43,209
That's it.

1382
02:00:48,027 --> 02:00:49,505
Stay far for some days.

1383
02:00:49,670 --> 02:00:51,060
Where should I be?
- Where to be?

1384
02:00:52,018 --> 02:00:53,708
No need, you come with me.

1385
02:00:53,828 --> 02:00:55,661
Then he?
- Who, Avinash?

1386
02:00:56,413 --> 02:00:58,969
I will send him to Dubai.
It's doubtful about him here.

1387
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:06,213
Few days everything was heard.

1388
02:01:07,496 --> 02:01:09,460
One day no one was talking.

1389
02:01:13,034 --> 02:01:16,236
Hari, Raviraj, Avinash, no one.

1390
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:29,156
They got to know I guess.

1391
02:01:29,550 --> 02:01:31,281
They became silent.

1392
02:01:42,839 --> 02:01:45,255
Despicable fellow's vehicle.

1393
02:02:10,970 --> 02:02:12,355
Was he not there?

1394
02:02:12,750 --> 02:02:14,994
No, I checked in Hari
brother's house too.

1395
02:02:15,581 --> 02:02:19,027
He was not there too,
checked in Raviraj house too.

1396
02:02:19,461 --> 02:02:20,920
He wasn't there too.

1397
02:02:26,915 --> 02:02:28,621
That despicable is going
to Dubai it seems.

1398
02:02:29,426 --> 02:02:31,281
Avinash?
- Yes.

1399
02:02:31,401 --> 02:02:33,805
He will go it seems.
- How he will go?

1400
02:02:34,036 --> 02:02:36,132
Don't know how, just know
that he will go.

1401
02:02:36,297 --> 02:02:37,699
Don't know when as well.

1402
02:02:40,166 --> 02:02:42,420
Hey play slowly.

1403
02:02:43,012 --> 02:02:44,629
Can't you play slowly?

1404
02:02:45,054 --> 02:02:46,663
Or go home and die.

1405
02:02:46,908 --> 02:02:48,537
Keep quiet, let them play.

1406
02:02:53,321 --> 02:02:54,727
Shouldn't leave that
despicable.

1407
02:02:56,247 --> 02:02:58,178
Before he leave, we must
beat him up.

1408
02:03:17,341 --> 02:03:21,220
Where they are, what's happening
there was no update at all.

1409
02:03:27,964 --> 02:03:29,912
When I thought nothing
more is going to happen.

1410
02:03:37,484 --> 02:03:39,005
Where are you? Come soon.

1411
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:40,715
In this dark, where?

1412
02:03:40,978 --> 02:03:42,801
I will meet you tomorrow.
- Are you my father?

1413
02:03:44,496 --> 02:03:46,453
I am going to Dubai tomorrow
morning. Why?

1414
02:03:46,623 --> 02:03:48,384
Why? Will you come here
or not now?

1415
02:03:57,035 --> 02:03:58,606
Hello Karunakar.

1416
02:04:29,816 --> 02:04:31,291
Drink and die.

1417
02:04:32,021 --> 02:04:33,402
Oh God!

1418
02:04:41,015 --> 02:04:41,961
Hey bro.

1419
02:04:42,041 --> 02:04:43,571
Though I go to Dubai,
you must all call.

1420
02:04:43,651 --> 02:04:45,868
Go and come bro.
- Bye, bye.

1421
02:04:45,988 --> 02:04:48,695
Bye, bye.
- Despicable, call okay.

1422
02:04:57,389 --> 02:04:59,910
Don't come, go and die.

1423
02:05:00,099 --> 02:05:01,426
We are leaving.

1424
02:05:12,550 --> 02:05:13,928
Do you want beetle?
- No need.

1425
02:05:14,644 --> 02:05:15,926
You?
- One sweet.

1426
02:05:16,046 --> 02:05:18,233
Bro, I will leave bro.

1427
02:05:19,110 --> 02:05:20,696
Okay bro.

1428
02:05:25,083 --> 02:05:27,216
Despicable when will you come?
- I am coming now.

1429
02:05:27,365 --> 02:05:28,676
Five minutes I will be there.

1430
02:05:28,830 --> 02:05:31,197
Only five minute, I will
leave after that.

1431
02:05:31,317 --> 02:05:32,789
Yes, he will come.

1432
02:05:59,026 --> 02:06:01,015
Come, come despicable
fellows.

1433
02:06:01,238 --> 02:06:04,651
I will kill each one of you.
Come here.

1434
02:06:11,214 --> 02:06:12,858
Shiva, Shiva.

1435
02:06:14,295 --> 02:06:16,464
I didn't do anything wrong.

1436
02:06:16,584 --> 02:06:18,401
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

1437
02:06:18,659 --> 02:06:20,400
I will go to Dubai.

1438
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:22,435
Please leave me just
tonight.

1439
02:06:23,110 --> 02:06:24,485
Tomorrow,

1440
02:06:24,707 --> 02:06:26,484
I will go from here, won't
interfere in your matter.

1441
02:06:26,604 --> 02:06:28,042
I will fall on your leg.

1442
02:06:28,162 --> 02:06:30,691
Shiva brother, listen please
listen to me.

1443
02:06:30,877 --> 02:06:33,172
Shiva brother, Shiva brother.

1444
02:06:55,464 --> 02:06:56,922
Hello!
- Sir.

1445
02:06:57,042 --> 02:06:58,823
It's done.
- Okay.

1446
02:07:15,112 --> 02:07:16,457
Hello.

1447
02:07:16,537 --> 02:07:19,463
You won't call, if I call
you won't pick.

1448
02:07:19,543 --> 02:07:20,821
Too much of work.

1449
02:07:21,274 --> 02:07:22,752
Baby slept?

1450
02:07:24,509 --> 02:07:26,842
Did you eat food?
- Yes, yours?

1451
02:07:27,893 --> 02:07:29,299
No, not yet.

1452
02:07:29,897 --> 02:07:31,205
What have you cooked?

1453
02:07:31,426 --> 02:07:33,739
Curry which I prepared
in the afternoon is still there.

1454
02:07:36,701 --> 02:07:38,071
Careful!

1455
02:07:38,329 --> 02:07:39,900
You be careful.

1456
02:07:40,531 --> 02:07:43,313
Okay, I will talk
to you later.

1457
02:07:58,970 --> 02:08:00,134
Ravi brother.

1458
02:08:01,138 --> 02:08:02,442
Ravi brother.

1459
02:08:04,492 --> 02:08:05,733
Why wait?

1460
02:08:07,036 --> 02:08:08,396
Finish off Shiva.

1461
02:08:14,565 --> 02:08:15,776
Have heard already.

1462
02:08:18,420 --> 02:08:19,804
Who?

1463
02:08:21,071 --> 02:08:22,255
Brother.

1464
02:08:22,637 --> 02:08:23,775
Water.

1465
02:08:24,815 --> 02:08:25,979
Brother, water.

1466
02:08:43,126 --> 02:08:44,672
Call the elder once.

1467
02:08:49,254 --> 02:08:51,367
That's too heavy, play and see.

1468
02:08:54,361 --> 02:08:55,958
It looks over.

1469
02:08:56,078 --> 02:08:57,356
Is this over?

1470
02:08:58,385 --> 02:09:00,059
Yes man, it is.

1471
02:09:00,179 --> 02:09:02,060
No, it's a little heavy.

1472
02:09:02,180 --> 02:09:03,425
If you just touch, it will
be a four.

1473
02:09:03,545 --> 02:09:04,523
Is this correct?

1474
02:09:04,643 --> 02:09:06,649
Look at this, how is the weight
on this? - That's heavy.

1475
02:09:06,769 --> 02:09:08,741
Should you need so much of heaviness,
you will get hurt if it's heavy.

1476
02:09:08,861 --> 02:09:10,497
This will be fine.

1477
02:09:11,234 --> 02:09:13,052
Is this fine? Look at it.

1478
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:14,577
What heavy is this?

1479
02:09:14,697 --> 02:09:17,365
You can play with this.
- I can't lift it.

1480
02:09:17,485 --> 02:09:20,043
After three days, saying
it was us who killed Avinash,

1481
02:09:20,163 --> 02:09:22,502
Neethu and another had surrendered.

1482
02:09:23,021 --> 02:09:24,839
Shiva and Shekar remained
outside.

1483
02:09:25,035 --> 02:09:26,982
From that day, they were
playing cricket daily.

1484
02:09:29,395 --> 02:09:31,358
They stopped playing as
Kishore died.

1485
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:34,939
Thinking he would be at peace,
they started playing again.

1486
02:09:39,329 --> 02:09:42,704
Ball was here. What wide.
- Wide, wide, wide.

1487
02:09:44,327 --> 02:09:46,484
It was here.
- It's wide, wide.

1488
02:09:46,604 --> 02:09:48,571
You are out on 16.

1489
02:09:48,691 --> 02:09:51,656
What is this Shiva brother,
it is not wide.

1490
02:09:55,334 --> 02:09:56,751
It's wide.
- What wide?

1491
02:09:56,871 --> 02:09:58,503
It's not wide.

1492
02:09:58,623 --> 02:10:00,106
Hey it's wide,
it's wide.

1493
02:10:00,226 --> 02:10:02,109
Hey it's not wide, it's not wide.
- Shiva brother is wrong.

1494
02:10:02,229 --> 02:10:03,850
If you need score, just take it.

1495
02:10:04,061 --> 02:10:05,746
It's not wide, Shiva brother.

1496
02:10:08,815 --> 02:10:11,304
What wide? It's not wide,
no, it's not.

1497
02:10:11,424 --> 02:10:13,009
Not wide, not wide, not wide.

1498
02:10:16,429 --> 02:10:17,840
Lawyer needs fees.

1499
02:10:18,932 --> 02:10:20,179
How much?

1500
02:10:20,540 --> 02:10:22,162
Don't know how much it is.

1501
02:10:22,387 --> 02:10:24,287
How much ever it is,
we need to have to give, right?

1502
02:10:27,467 --> 02:10:31,582
How is Savi?
- He says to take him out quickly.

1503
02:10:32,180 --> 02:10:34,216
Food is blunt.

1504
02:10:37,807 --> 02:10:41,149
What to do?
- Don't know.

1505
02:10:42,482 --> 02:10:44,324
But we must do something.

1506
02:10:46,449 --> 02:10:48,085
Shall we release tigers?

1507
02:10:49,978 --> 02:10:51,620
If not, what else?

1508
02:10:51,795 --> 02:10:53,984
If not we cannot
bring him out.

1509
02:10:54,345 --> 02:10:56,020
You do that.

1510
02:10:57,817 --> 02:11:00,032
Did you give him the
new shirt?

1511
02:11:03,047 --> 02:11:07,313
Shiva brother, what is this Shiva
brother, I told you it's heavy.

1512
02:11:07,764 --> 02:11:10,461
Can't lift, how to hit?
- Fate, give it here.

1513
02:11:10,726 --> 02:11:13,189
Say that you don't know to play.
Is this bat heavy?

1514
02:11:13,885 --> 02:11:18,122
Throw. You need 4 runs for
6 balls, right?

1515
02:12:19,060 --> 02:12:21,100
Shiva brother,
Shiva brother.

1516
02:12:21,270 --> 02:12:23,681
Someone go and get
an auto.

1517
02:12:23,801 --> 02:12:25,298
Go quickly.

1518
02:12:25,418 --> 02:12:26,720
Didn't make you money.

1519
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:28,456
Despicable what money
will you make.

1520
02:12:28,576 --> 02:12:30,789
What happened?

1521
02:12:31,016 --> 02:12:32,777
What happened, Shekar?

1522
02:12:32,942 --> 02:12:34,894
Bring quickly.

1523
02:12:35,014 --> 02:12:37,670
Nothing happened, I told
you right.

1524
02:12:37,851 --> 02:12:39,757
Leave, I will stand.

1525
02:12:39,877 --> 02:12:41,555
Nothing has happened
to me.

1526
02:12:41,675 --> 02:12:43,404
What happened now?

1527
02:12:43,524 --> 02:12:45,156
Nothing happened to me.

1528
02:12:46,923 --> 02:12:50,437
Don't cry, why are you
crying?

1529
02:12:50,557 --> 02:12:52,420
For what are you crying?

1530
02:12:52,605 --> 02:12:53,868
Move, move in.

1531
02:12:53,988 --> 02:12:55,954
Go quickly.

1532
02:12:56,129 --> 02:12:58,606
Go, go.

1533
02:13:07,067 --> 02:13:09,398
Shiva brother,
Shiva brother.

1534
02:13:09,694 --> 02:13:12,025
Shiva brother.

1535
02:13:12,225 --> 02:13:13,744
Don't lose.

1536
02:13:13,864 --> 02:13:15,883
Shekar.

1537
02:13:16,237 --> 02:13:18,987
Water.
- Water, water.

1538
02:13:19,173 --> 02:13:21,363
Have you got water?
Brother, have you got water?

1539
02:13:21,483 --> 02:13:23,430
Give, give.

1540
02:13:25,581 --> 02:13:27,865
Water is over, I will get
you in the hospital, okay.

1541
02:13:27,985 --> 02:13:29,526
Hold on for some more time.

1542
02:13:29,646 --> 02:13:31,734
Hospital is about to reach,
I will give you then.

1543
02:13:31,915 --> 02:13:33,578
Shiva brother.

1544
02:13:33,698 --> 02:13:36,597
Shiva brother.
- Hey shut up nothing, nothing.

1545
02:13:37,405 --> 02:13:40,403
I will give you once
we reach hospital.

1546
02:13:41,109 --> 02:13:43,808
Hold on till then.

1547
02:13:43,928 --> 02:13:46,115
Hold on till then, nothing
will happen.

1548
02:13:46,280 --> 02:13:49,783
Don't lose hope.

1549
02:13:51,384 --> 02:13:54,604
Hold on, Shiva brother.

1550
02:13:55,279 --> 02:13:58,128
Shiva brother, hold on
we reached.

1551
02:13:58,248 --> 02:14:00,007
Go in quickly.

1552
02:14:13,525 --> 02:14:14,918
He was alive only for
half an hour it seems.

1553
02:14:16,142 --> 02:14:17,569
Then they put him in mortuary.

1554
02:14:22,254 --> 02:14:24,730
The whole Mangala Devi
was empty that day.

1555
02:14:40,359 --> 02:14:43,225
Shall we go to the hospital?
- Yes, let's go. Hey no need.

1556
02:14:43,345 --> 02:14:44,620
Hey let's go come.

1557
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:46,319
Despicable you go, I will not come.

1558
02:14:46,557 --> 02:14:48,170
I cannot.
- Let's go once.

1559
02:14:48,369 --> 02:14:49,735
I told you, if I see once I will

1560
02:14:49,815 --> 02:14:51,635
not get sleep, I can't.
- Okay, fine.

1561
02:14:51,715 --> 02:14:53,514
No need, I can't, I won't come.

1562
02:14:57,231 --> 02:14:58,932
Leave it.

1563
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:01,457
I cannot believe at all.

1564
02:15:02,932 --> 02:15:04,876
I feel like he is going
to come now.

1565
02:15:07,085 --> 02:15:09,133
Yes, the despicable he shot him.

1566
02:15:09,732 --> 02:15:11,760
Could have done something.

1567
02:15:12,173 --> 02:15:14,014
I was able to see it
with my eyes.

1568
02:15:14,781 --> 02:15:17,685
That despicable was doing
something like this in hand.

1569
02:15:18,909 --> 02:15:20,338
I have never seen such a death.

1570
02:15:21,498 --> 02:15:23,070
Eyes man.

1571
02:15:23,984 --> 02:15:26,032
Death.

1572
02:16:23,558 --> 02:16:25,036
Have told everyone.

1573
02:16:25,381 --> 02:16:28,225
Born for one, I have gone
around Mangala Devi.

1574
02:16:29,724 --> 02:16:32,135
Huh? Okay.

1575
02:16:49,886 --> 02:16:51,262
Huh!

1576
02:17:00,462 --> 02:17:01,765
To whom?

1577
02:17:01,885 --> 02:17:03,135
Hey whom are you calling?

1578
02:17:03,255 --> 02:17:04,459
To Shekar brother.
- Why?

1579
02:17:04,579 --> 02:17:05,700
Let him come and finish
off this despicable.

1580
02:17:05,820 --> 02:17:07,900
Have you lost your mind?
- Shut up.

1581
02:17:08,020 --> 02:17:09,991
Hey don't make the call.
- Don't touch my body.

1582
02:17:10,111 --> 02:17:11,330
If you do so, I will not come.
- No!

1583
02:17:11,450 --> 02:17:12,756
Then what's wrong with you?

1584
02:17:13,688 --> 02:17:16,453
He is not picking up the phone,
if left today he will escape.

1585
02:17:16,947 --> 02:17:18,390
No need man.

1586
02:17:19,547 --> 02:17:20,549
Have to do something.

1587
02:17:20,669 --> 02:17:21,682
What to do?

1588
02:17:24,285 --> 02:17:26,571
Shall we only do it.
- You are mad.

1589
02:17:26,747 --> 02:17:28,658
You have lost your mind.
That's it.

1590
02:17:28,778 --> 02:17:30,208
Clear your mind first.

1591
02:17:30,801 --> 02:17:32,464
I will go alone, if you want
to come, come.

1592
02:17:32,584 --> 02:17:34,149
Hey, are you crazy?

1593
02:17:34,269 --> 02:17:36,802
Stop, stop, hey stop.

1594
02:17:37,008 --> 02:17:38,636
Stop, stop.

1595
02:17:39,017 --> 02:17:41,767
Hey stop man, stop.

1596
02:19:10,495 --> 02:19:11,546
What is it?

1597
02:19:13,830 --> 02:19:15,395
What?

1598
02:19:20,496 --> 02:19:23,195
You've come to hit me?
Huh?

1599
02:19:25,507 --> 02:19:27,142
Despicable fellow.

1600
02:19:29,782 --> 02:19:32,622
You've come to hit me?
Is it so?

1601
02:19:42,360 --> 02:19:44,769
Go home. Go home.

1602
02:19:46,598 --> 02:19:48,407
Go home.

1603
02:19:49,380 --> 02:19:51,525
What's your age, boy?

1604
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:56,626
Whom brought you here?
Who brought you?

1605
02:19:58,059 --> 02:20:00,635
Is it him?
Are you the one?

1606
02:20:00,973 --> 02:20:02,414
Don't have strength to even stand.

1607
02:20:02,494 --> 02:20:03,834
Hey hit him.
- Who?

1608
02:20:07,136 --> 02:20:09,087
Why did you take the wicket?

1609
02:20:11,051 --> 02:20:13,164
Give it here.
Give.

1610
02:20:14,110 --> 02:20:17,165
What? Huh?

1611
02:20:21,112 --> 02:20:22,709
Go home, go home.

1612
02:20:23,430 --> 02:20:25,935
Don't you understand, go home.
- We aren't going.

1613
02:20:26,798 --> 02:20:28,737
If it's a show, it's for
his dad.

1614
02:20:29,156 --> 02:20:31,326
Whose father? Your father?

1615
02:20:33,934 --> 02:20:36,729
First, I will take you then.
- Hey, hit him.

1616
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:41,077
Despicable fellows, don't you
understand, go home guys.

1617
02:20:41,785 --> 02:20:43,871
Yeah!

1618
02:25:02,510 --> 02:25:04,075
On the same day both of
them died.

1619
02:25:04,848 --> 02:25:06,383
All my work was done.

1620
02:25:07,006 --> 02:25:08,346
Except one.

1621
02:25:10,726 --> 02:25:12,160
Brahmayya.

1622
02:25:12,341 --> 02:25:13,998
Congratulations!
