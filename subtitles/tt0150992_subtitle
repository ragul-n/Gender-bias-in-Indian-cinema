1
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:06,262
Let the turban race begin!

2
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:23,082
Can't I pray wearing my
American hat, brother?

3
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:25,784
In India, one wears a
turban while praying.

4
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:32,882
Damn it!
You don't know anything!

5
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:38,130
Sister-in-law, get him a wife who'll
tie his turban and his pajama string.

6
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:54,871
What a fuss!
They're being so childish.

7
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:58,173
It's a festival; they have every
right to enjoy themselves today.

8
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:02,085
And I don't think it's
right to be so strict.

9
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:05,481
I'm not being strict,
I'm talking about discipline.

10
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:08,387
- That should apply to you too.
- What do you mean?

11
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:11,128
It's Diwali today, and you're
going to attend the music concert.

12
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:14,399
Once you start singing,
people won't let you stop.

13
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:16,367
Is the turban okay?

14
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:22,706
Whenever you tie my turban,
my every note sounds melodious.

15
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:27,602
Honestly, if I didn't have you,
I'd have been a very bad singer.

16
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:28,848
You're lying.

17
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:33,377
- Come home soon today.
- Why?

18
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:38,121
Your student is going to
arrive from Italy today.

19
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:41,822
If he speaks Italian,
how will we speak with him?

20
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:46,889
No, he can speak many languages.
He speaks very good Hindi.

21
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,564
He's half-Indian.

22
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,939
I had asked Nandini to vacate
her room for him, did she do it?

23
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:59,506
I did tell her, but it made her
so angry that she left in a huff.

24
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:03,010
- Why should that make her angry?
- Ask her.

25
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:05,751
I'll call her here.
You convince her.

26
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:16,559
"Like a line drawn
in the soil...."

27
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:22,926
"God has created
something"

28
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:30,139
"It took a mixture of
fire, air and water..."

29
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:37,246
"to make a picture
so perfect"

30
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:48,586
"You laugh with such
gay abandon"

31
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:52,298
"You are a wonder of nature"

32
00:05:56,803 --> 00:06:00,534
"You win hearts;
the sight of you..."

33
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:05,471
sets off storms
and lightning"

34
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:08,370
"You are incomparable,
O fair virgin..."

35
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:13,312
"In you is all nature.
In you, it is"

36
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:23,455
"You are made of clay, no doubt.
But innocence-personified are you"

37
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:24,959
"You're simplicity
and innocence..."

38
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:29,464
"keeps you going"

39
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:33,037
"Like the breeze,
you waft..."

40
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:34,672
"like the waters,
you flow"

41
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:36,569
"Like a stream,
you flow"

42
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,936
"The confluence of waters
is your beauty"

43
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:39,304
"Like a raging fire..."

44
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:41,514
"is your passionate youth"

45
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:00,024
"Swaying as you walk..."

46
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:02,234
"you speed up
and turn around..."

47
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:04,096
"kissing the soil..."

48
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:05,804
"You are mischievous"

49
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:09,405
"Like the wild spring;
the gay dance..."

50
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:11,075
"You have piercing eyes"

51
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:13,802
"You have all the airs"

52
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:41,873
Where were you?
- Still angry?

53
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:45,878
- Father was inquiring about you.
- I'd gone to buy the lantern.

54
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:49,639
But where will you hang it,
you have to vacate your room.

55
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:53,142
Come what may,
I will not vacate my room.

56
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,288
I decorate my room so
lovingly every Diwali...

57
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:58,557
not for a stranger to occupy it.

58
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:02,761
I'll never tolerate that!
But why are you all after my room?

59
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:07,465
Because the mansion's best
room has been given to you.

60
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:12,738
But don't worry, we'll all
help you vacate it. Won't we?

61
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:14,303
And then, there is nothing
in your room...

62
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:19,774
...except the yellow flowers,
the lamp chandelier you like...

63
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:21,980
...and your little diary.

64
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:26,276
If you all tease me,
I'll spoil this Rangoli.

65
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:38,894
Where were you, dear. You know
I don't leave without seeing you.

66
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:43,760
Answer me.
Oh! You are a statue?

67
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,862
But you can indicate
with your eyes.

68
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:49,340
Did you vacate the room?

69
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,703
You're still angry.

70
00:08:54,147 --> 00:09:00,211
Look, dear. He's our guest,
and we must honor a guest.

71
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,615
Vacate the room before
I get back, all right?

72
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:09,060
That's a pretty lantern.
Let's go, Bhairon.

73
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:16,465
Just let him come! I'll make him so
miserable, he'll leave in two days.

74
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:22,874
I will go to the mansion, father!

75
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:26,441
I haven't left mother,
I'll never leave her.

76
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:35,153
You love being up there,
don't you? Stay up!

77
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:41,916
Oh no, I don't need your help,
I'll find my own way.

78
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:49,268
This way.
But where?

79
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:02,944
No, I don't need your help,
I'll ask these sands the way.

80
00:10:08,588 --> 00:10:11,250
You're laughing? You're enjoying
troubling your son, aren't you?

81
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:17,587
But get this clear, I'll go to
the mansion, I'll learn music...

82
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:23,097
...I'll live in India, and
I'll call mother here from Italy.

83
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,269
You slapped me?

84
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:34,805
It's the first time you've
slapped me, but I'll still go.

85
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:42,319
Why shouldn't I?
Who's over there?

86
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:46,883
O Italian, may you forget your
way before you reach my room.

87
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,993
May you be robbed, may you lose
your way, may you go hungry!

88
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:51,455
May the hot sands...

89
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:57,466
He fell in the water!

90
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:05,134
Welcome! What an entry!
From Italy into the water!

91
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,147
How are you?

92
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:15,852
Let me introduce everybody.
My younger brother, Nilesh.

93
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,885
My wife, Pushpa.
- Hello!

94
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:21,817
This is Parul.

95
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,634
This is my brother, Tarun,
who has returned from America.

96
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:31,197
And I'm Kamlesh.

97
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,966
The cheek he has!
He pulled everyone in the water.

98
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,211
Oh no, he's so jovial,
he's made everybody laugh.

99
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:45,113
That's only for now. He'll make
everyone cry when he leaves.

100
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:48,514
And I'm Bhairon.

101
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:54,582
What have you done!
You pushed the guest in the water?

102
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:57,191
Pardon them, this is not
how we welcome a guest.

103
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:02,627
Come, the food is ready.
I'll take you to your room.

104
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:05,662
He's a jovial guy,
we'll get along very well.

105
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:10,875
A few days with us and
he'll have adopted our ways.

106
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:15,703
What was the need
to invite him here?

107
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:20,381
There are so many young girls in the
house, what if he woos one of them?

108
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:25,648
Aunt, can't you say anything
good about anybody?

109
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:30,284
Who is she, Vithal?
- She's the mistress of the house.

110
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:33,964
She rules the roost,
but she's very kind hearted.

111
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:41,563
Welcome! You've arrived on a very
auspicious day, it's Diwali today.

112
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,705
How was the journey?
Did you come swimming?

113
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:52,576
No, I fell in the water.

114
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:57,888
Vithal, show him to his room,
and get the breakfast ready.

115
00:12:58,257 --> 00:13:00,418
I'll just be back from the temple.
- Yes, ma'am.

116
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,354
Auntie, can I say something?

117
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:09,158
Even my husband says so.

118
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:14,199
Where is my room?

119
00:13:15,174 --> 00:13:18,905
What did you say?
Just you wait!

120
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:20,236
The Italian is here!

121
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:36,091
Hi! How are you?

122
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:38,522
I think you're upset.

123
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:42,460
I'm Sameer, you can call me Sam.

124
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:46,996
What's your name?

125
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:53,409
Can I call you Nandu?
- Only Nandini!

126
00:13:57,316 --> 00:14:02,447
Your name is different.
Does it mean Nandi, the bull?

127
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:05,217
It's not necessary for every name
to have a meaning.

128
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:08,049
It's not necessary for you to look
at me while lighting every candle.

129
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:13,288
First you look away.
- How can I, your eyes hold me.

130
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,899
Why should they?
- You'll burn your hands.

131
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:25,805
See! The effect of an evil eye.
- You must have cast an evil eye.

132
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:28,945
I don't have evil eyes.
- Then what eyes do you have?

133
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:32,242
Sharp, very sharp eyes,
they can see your soul.

134
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:35,513
And what do they say?
- The tangy lemon!

135
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:38,848
The tangy lemon?
So sweet!

136
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:44,326
Shift your gaze or you'll
loosen your grip on the rope.

137
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:46,657
Never mind.
- The chandelier will fall.

138
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:48,663
Let it.
- The glass will break.

139
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:53,167
Let it.
- If it breaks, you will blink.

140
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:55,431
Let's see who blinks first.

141
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:24,527
If you keep looking at me,
you'll fall in love with me.

142
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:32,610
Listen!
You have, haven't you?

143
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:49,922
What are you all gossiping about?

144
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,153
He's stripping!

145
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:26,061
Come on, get in.
- Wait!

146
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:38,139
Will you just keep laughing
or tell me about it too?

147
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:42,746
It's nothing grandma, they've
been laughing at the Italian.

148
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:48,517
What does he look like?
- Tell her.

149
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:52,053
"A guest we have at home
who talks so very sweetly"

150
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:55,761
"A handsome young man who
rents mischief in the air"

151
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:57,996
"A great face,
he's innocent looking"

152
00:16:58,197 --> 00:16:59,926
"he wins over your heart"

153
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:04,125
"A body like marble,
he's everyone's favorite"

154
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:09,807
"He's so very bitter
and cunning"

155
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:14,836
"He stole my bed, my room,
everything that belonged to me"

156
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:18,346
"I'm sure I'll give him
the treatment too"

157
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:25,214
"Listen to me...
I haven't been able to understand"

158
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:28,585
"Which bird are you
talking about?"

159
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:32,330
"Beware, you're young; lest he casts
a shadow on you"

160
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:35,796
"Don't get close to him; he'll touch
you and you'll be afflicted"

161
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:39,231
"You will neither eat nor sleep;
you will suffer heartburn"

162
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:42,997
"When he takes to his wings,
the world will laugh at you"

163
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:52,883
You've come even here?!

164
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,244
I heard you laughing,
so I came over.

165
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:58,054
This is a house, not a garden
that you can walk in anywhere.

166
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:01,658
Come, I'll show you.

167
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:08,733
Grandma, I'm Sameer. I have
come from Italy. How are you?

168
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:11,801
Sameer! A whiff of cool breeze.

169
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:17,573
Call him a snowstorm grandma.
He'll leave everybody cold.

170
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:18,967
Come!

171
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:24,807
You are just what I'd thought
you'd be. You have no manners.

172
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:28,145
You bathe in the open! You see
girls and walk into their room!

173
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:31,219
If you want to live here, you'll have
to follow the rules of this house

174
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:33,221
Or you'll be thrown out.

175
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:34,959
Why do you get so
annoyed, Mandakini?

176
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:39,094
I'm not Mandakini, I'm Nandini.
You've been a pain since you've come.

177
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:42,391
You've taken away my room, now you're
wooing everybody with your sweet talk.

178
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:47,004
By tomorrow,
you'll become father's pet.

179
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:49,671
Have you come here from Italy
to learn music or to have fun?

180
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:54,741
You call yourself a singer?
You look like a muscleman to me.

181
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:56,605
Here's your room.

182
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:14,193
Oh damn it! What a mess.
This guy is too much!

183
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,764
When will this guy go back?!

184
00:19:26,111 --> 00:19:28,739
What are you doing in my room?
- This is my room, you idiot!

185
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:32,848
This is now my room and I'll
roam around as I please in it.

186
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:38,055
I'd come to take my diary, you...
- Don't look, I'm still in my towel.

187
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:42,624
May you get lost in the desert
before you reach my room.

188
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:45,225
Don't you dare read my diary!

189
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,797
How can you read someone's diary?
What a mess you've made of the room.

190
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:54,401
Don't you think this room
looks more alive now.

191
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,799
Master has called the guest.

192
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:00,572
The master has called?
- Go quickly!

193
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:15,023
Have you come here to bathe or
to eat? Go wear your clothes.

194
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:21,089
He came in his towel.

195
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:29,039
He went in his towel,
he'll get a good hiding!

196
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:32,805
It's good my towel
didn't come lose.

197
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:34,411
Listen!
- I went in my towel

198
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,080
We tried to stop you,
but you didn't hear us.

199
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:40,841
Doesn't matter. Now, to please
father, greet him in a special way.

200
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:43,021
Special way?
- Show him how.

201
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:49,859
Got it?
- Yes...

202
00:20:50,195 --> 00:20:52,129
but she isn't fooling me, is she?
- Not at all...

203
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:55,765
how can she do that to a guest.

204
00:20:55,968 --> 00:20:57,367
Go, hurry!

205
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:24,059
What's going on?
What are you doing?

206
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:29,833
I'm greeting you, sir.
- Like this? Who taught you this?

207
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:36,798
Go and sit on that chair.

208
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:55,693
Wait! Let him sing first.
- Let him eat, he must be hungry.

209
00:21:55,894 --> 00:21:59,830
No, let me judge him right now.

210
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:04,091
He kept writing to me, he's come
from Italy to learn music.

211
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:09,166
I want to hear him to know whether
he deserves to learn it at all.

212
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:12,308
Sing!

213
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,538
That was wonderful!

214
00:24:21,473 --> 00:24:27,207
You are not only a good singer
but seem to be a good man too.

215
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:30,778
While teaching you, maybe even
I learn something from you.

216
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:32,244
Shall I teach you now, sir?

217
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:36,813
Not now, let's have breakfast now.

218
00:24:44,897 --> 00:24:53,930
Music means everything to me.
Music is great, like God.

219
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:56,607
To be a great singer, it is very
necessary to have a pure mind.

220
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:01,405
It is said that a fake
singer sings superficially...

221
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,246
...a hungry man sings
to fill his stomach...

222
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:08,845
...but a true singer
sings from the heart.

223
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:12,522
You sing from the heart,
that's why I'm going to teach you.

224
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:20,522
Sir, your fees?
- My music is not for sale.

225
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:26,565
But I may take something when
the time comes, or I may not.

226
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:32,135
My father will be
very pleased today.

227
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:06,524
I won't be able to eat anymore.

228
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,698
Until you don't burp 3-4 times like
this, you haven't eaten anything.

229
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:19,865
You are young,
you should eat more.

230
00:29:20,372 --> 00:29:24,069
You'll have to eat what I've made
or I'll be offended.

231
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:28,205
You haven't eaten any dhokla,
you must have some.

232
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,250
And these Kachoris.
- And something sweet too.

233
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:11,019
All that lentil-stuff...
I can't digest it.

234
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,453
You'll keep this between us,
won't you? Please!

235
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,220
Grandma was right,
Sameer, a whiff of air!

236
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:28,204
Why are you after me?
Have some sense of timing at least.

237
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:30,338
You embarrassed me before her.

238
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:04,862
Thinking about me, aren't you?
- Yes.

239
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:07,999
No.

240
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:12,043
You're lying. You are
thinking about me, I know.

241
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:15,075
Why should I think about you?

242
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:17,843
Then who were you thinking about?

243
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:22,912
About myself.
- It's one and the same thing.

244
00:32:24,889 --> 00:32:27,881
Don't assume things,
you'll be heartbroken.

245
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,724
Then what are you doing
on the terrace at night?

246
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:33,928
I come here very often.

247
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:39,128
When father practices at night,
the stars and I listen to him.

248
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:44,934
Grandma says these stars
change our destiny.

249
00:32:45,877 --> 00:32:49,176
But they are very dear to me.

250
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:52,615
What if your dear ones
go against you?

251
00:32:53,184 --> 00:32:59,487
Then I'll fight with them. They'll
have to give me the destiny I want.

252
00:33:02,027 --> 00:33:07,966
Do you believe in destiny?
- Believe? I can even read destiny.

253
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:11,361
Really? Then read mine.

254
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:16,838
It's Indians who read destiny in
hands, we Italians read the feet.

255
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:21,144
Really? Then read my feet.

256
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:25,473
Let me first tell you
that you have beautiful feet.

257
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:27,377
Read!

258
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:33,081
And your feet will very soon...
Feeling ticklish, aren't you?

259
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:40,129
They'll very soon take you across
seven seas for the sake of love.

260
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:41,558
Where?

261
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:46,129
Madras...

262
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:51,302
Calcutta, Bihar...

263
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:52,900
London...

264
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:57,108
Italy!

265
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:01,281
Stupid!

266
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:08,349
Look, a falling star!

267
00:34:17,068 --> 00:34:18,535
Did you wish for something?

268
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:22,632
No.
- Why?

269
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:26,435
My mother says you should not wish
on a falling star, it's inauspicious.

270
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:29,344
You miss your mother very much,
don't you?

271
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:31,481
Yes. She's so far away.

272
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:37,716
And your father?
- He's very close to me.

273
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:46,121
And...
- And your girlfriend?

274
00:34:47,298 --> 00:34:49,061
I don't have a girlfriend.

275
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:57,304
Listen! Will you be my friend?

276
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:47,411
Women cannot compete with men.
- Both are equals.

277
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:55,313
Even a simple walk down the
stairs is a task for you.

278
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,593
What happened?

279
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:06,296
Tell them how men are
superior to women.

280
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:07,691
Of course they are!

281
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:13,563
Oh! You too. Tell us what men
can do that we women cannot.

282
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:17,767
There are many, but let me
give you just one example.

283
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:22,573
Can you do this?

284
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,569
Only women are permitted here.
What are you doing here?

285
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:50,498
Music drew me here.
- Can you see any other man here?

286
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:51,570
Vithal is here.

287
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:54,073
That's different.
Vithal has reared us.

288
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:57,676
If the women see you here,
they'll beat you to pulp. Go!

289
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:00,407
Do you have songs
for every occasion?

290
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:03,118
Yes, every occasion.

291
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:10,089
Wedding songs, harvest songs,
love songs, spring songs, Bhavai...

292
00:39:10,294 --> 00:39:12,228
Havai?
- No, Bhavai.

293
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,464
Haven't you heard of that?
I'll sing it.

294
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:18,326
"I'm a tall young man.
I wear a turban"

295
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:19,501
"I sport big whiskers,
like every colorful Gujarati"

296
00:39:19,704 --> 00:39:21,399
"I'm a colorful Gujarati"

297
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:29,270
And the one in which you clap?

298
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:30,738
Garba!
- Yes.

299
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:40,323
"Apply henna on her hands..."

300
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:43,160
And?
- Bhangra.

301
00:39:45,697 --> 00:39:47,460
You are making fun of me!

302
00:39:51,636 --> 00:39:54,127
Shall I tell you something?
- Yes.

303
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:56,396
Sister!
- Some other time.

304
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:58,969
Sister, they are calling you.

305
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,839
I'm coming.
- Come soon!

306
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:08,650
Only my voice?

307
00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:13,156
And?
- Your hair.

308
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:15,086
And?
- Your smile.

309
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:18,093
And?

310
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:20,397
Your style of saying,
'falling star'.

311
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:22,033
And?

312
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:23,466
Nandini!
- Coming!

313
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:30,732
Go on, hurry!
- Your mummy, your daddy.

314
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:36,240
Coming!
- Your cook, your sweets, flowers.

315
00:40:36,514 --> 00:40:38,004
You are an absolute nut!

316
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:45,378
I didn't say it!

317
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:52,028
Why are you laughing, even you
don't know. Shall I tell you?

318
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:06,004
The groom has arrived,
you aren't dressed yet?

319
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,473
Go get dressed, and see if
Anu is ready or not, hurry!

320
00:41:10,414 --> 00:41:11,540
Yes, mother.

321
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:20,514
You're okay.
- Excuse me!

322
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:22,726
I look better than you right now.

323
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:27,425
Take a look at me after I get
dressed, you'll be stunned.

324
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:30,698
The way she boasts, it'd appear
she's the Miss World.

325
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:38,302
Anu, are you ready?
The groom has arrived.

326
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:41,041
Shall I come in to help you?

327
00:41:41,379 --> 00:41:42,937
No, just give me a minute.

328
00:41:43,548 --> 00:41:47,450
You'll have to come with me,
I cannot live without you.

329
00:41:47,852 --> 00:41:50,286
Do you know how I spent
these six months?

330
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:53,352
I suffocated within,
but kept a smile on my lips.

331
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:55,422
But you simply went away.

332
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,294
Only to make myself
good enough for you.

333
00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:00,053
Coming, Nandini.

334
00:42:00,665 --> 00:42:04,624
Let's run away.
- You're saying that now?

335
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:09,529
My parents will die of shame.
It's too late now. Go!

336
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:16,906
What happened?
- I broke a vase.

337
00:42:17,114 --> 00:42:19,173
Are you all right?
- Yes.

338
00:42:24,522 --> 00:42:26,422
We'll definitely meet one day.

339
00:42:29,894 --> 00:42:31,486
Coming, Nandini.

340
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:37,790
Thank God you opened the door.
What were you doing for so long?

341
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:39,696
How do I look?

342
00:42:41,606 --> 00:42:44,336
It'd obviously take time; I'm being
a bride for the first time.

343
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:47,003
Scared?
- A little.

344
00:42:47,378 --> 00:42:52,008
I'm so happy for you.
- Get dressed, I'll go meet grandma.

345
00:43:03,394 --> 00:43:05,225
I'll go take care of the guests.

346
00:43:07,965 --> 00:43:09,262
Fix it properly.

347
00:43:43,267 --> 00:43:45,701
I'm Tarun.
You look beautiful.

348
00:44:26,577 --> 00:44:32,982
"These trespasses of my eyes..."

349
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:36,148
"please do forgive"

350
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:45,595
"These trespasses of my eyes..."

351
00:44:45,863 --> 00:44:48,354
"please do forgive"

352
00:44:50,568 --> 00:44:54,129
"With my gaze fixed on you..."

353
00:44:54,472 --> 00:44:58,568
"that which my lips
should say to you..."

354
00:44:58,843 --> 00:45:02,904
"my eyes do"

355
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:10,052
"The modesty and shyness
my eyes observe..."

356
00:45:10,287 --> 00:45:13,518
"please do forgive"

357
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:21,762
"They lower under your gaze"

358
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:27,665
"That which my eyes could
tell you when I looked at you..."

359
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:32,704
"I tell you,
with my eyes lowered"

360
00:45:35,146 --> 00:45:42,348
"These intrusions of my eyes..."

361
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,181
"please do forgive"

362
00:46:11,682 --> 00:46:18,178
"This kohl in your eyes,
I want on my lips"

363
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:25,693
"I want to save you from the
eyes of the Sun and Moon"

364
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:34,400
"Come, let me hide you
in my eyes"

365
00:46:35,606 --> 00:46:42,978
"My flights of fancy..."

366
00:46:43,247 --> 00:46:46,478
"do please forgive"

367
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:51,520
"Every moment,
I think of you"

368
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:55,724
"When everyone else
is in his senses..."

369
00:46:56,026 --> 00:47:00,156
"your memories
take my senses away"

370
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:07,428
"The modesty and shyness
my eyes observe..."

371
00:47:07,705 --> 00:47:10,970
"do please forgive"

372
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:35,160
"To you my life
shall always belong"

373
00:47:36,433 --> 00:47:43,236
"Love for you,
my heart shall always have"

374
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:52,075
"To even breathe,
I shall forever need you"

375
00:47:52,416 --> 00:48:00,016
"I'm naive at heart..."

376
00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:03,715
"please do forgive me"

377
00:48:04,662 --> 00:48:11,158
"My heart heeds not me"

378
00:48:12,736 --> 00:48:20,142
"The dreams I have begun to dream..."

379
00:48:20,544 --> 00:48:23,138
"my heart strings"

380
00:48:24,315 --> 00:48:32,347
"The trespasses of my eyes..."

381
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:34,317
"please do forgive"

382
00:48:34,692 --> 00:48:37,490
"My shyness and modesty..."

383
00:48:37,728 --> 00:48:40,663
"please do forgive"

384
00:48:50,307 --> 00:48:51,865
Aren't you ashamed to do that
in everyone's presence?

385
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:54,306
Nandini, listen...

386
00:48:54,578 --> 00:48:56,944
I don't want to hear anything.
You've spoilt my photograph.

387
00:48:57,248 --> 00:49:01,378
Why are you getting angry?
I was only joking.

388
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:06,583
You want to know what I wanted
to tell you yesterday?

389
00:49:07,057 --> 00:49:09,252
You didn't tell me yesterday.
Sorry, I don't want to hear it now.

390
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,953
Let me tell you.
- Leave me, what are you doing?

391
00:49:30,748 --> 00:49:32,306
Please cool down now.

392
00:49:32,683 --> 00:49:37,052
There were so many people around...
what if someone had seen us?

393
00:49:37,788 --> 00:49:40,655
The celebrations are about to begin,
don't be a spoilsport.

394
00:49:41,225 --> 00:49:43,693
All right, tell me what you
wanted to, I'll listen.

395
00:49:45,462 --> 00:49:49,364
I now want to say that you
are not worthy of my love.

396
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,433
Oh really?
Then stay in your room!

397
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:57,198
There may be someone at the wedding
who finds me suitable.

398
00:49:57,541 --> 00:50:01,841
If he asks for my hand in marriage,
you'll be left helpless.

399
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:27,002
"The sour lime..."

400
00:50:43,687 --> 00:50:47,885
"The sour lime..."

401
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:53,924
"Get me a sour lemon"

402
00:50:54,398 --> 00:50:55,831
"The sour lime..."

403
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:58,029
"A little sour lemon..."

404
00:50:58,402 --> 00:51:04,204
"Get me a sour lemon"

405
00:51:04,775 --> 00:51:11,010
"Go and get it for me...
get it for me"

406
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:15,444
"Go the fields and
get me a sour lemon"

407
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:19,655
"A sour lemon..."

408
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:23,824
"A sour lemon..."

409
00:51:24,128 --> 00:51:29,691
"Get me one..."

410
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:41,440
"One from the fields...
get me a sour lemon"

411
00:51:43,147 --> 00:51:45,945
"Get me a sour lemon"

412
00:52:30,961 --> 00:52:35,625
"If you wish to escape
the evil eye, listen to me"

413
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:43,305
"If you wish to escape
the evil eye, listen to me"

414
00:52:43,607 --> 00:52:47,634
"slice a little sour lemon..."

415
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:52,177
"and see it work"

416
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:55,977
"The evil eye will
turn sour for itself"

417
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,450
"It will fall by the way"

418
00:53:06,597 --> 00:53:11,159
"One from the fields...
get me a sour lemon"

419
00:53:11,468 --> 00:53:19,568
"A sour lemon..."

420
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:26,439
"Get me a sour lemon"

421
00:53:30,687 --> 00:53:32,552
"So tiny it is...
yet so juicy"

422
00:53:32,856 --> 00:53:34,448
"Tangy and sour it is"

423
00:53:34,858 --> 00:53:36,553
"It's smell tempts you..."

424
00:53:36,827 --> 00:53:38,124
"it's so sour"

425
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:39,124
"In love, my beloved..."

426
00:53:57,247 --> 00:54:17,829
"lovers end up casting
an eye on each other..."

427
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:32,044
"and there are often
lovers tiffs"

428
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:39,016
"But this is love for you"

429
00:54:45,362 --> 00:54:49,423
"Get one for me, friends..."

430
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:53,625
"a little sour lemon"

431
00:54:55,606 --> 00:55:02,409
"A sour lemon"

432
00:55:02,746 --> 00:55:11,779
"A sour lemon"

433
00:56:20,557 --> 00:56:24,857
You are too much, brother!

434
00:56:25,162 --> 00:56:28,359
I wanted to introduce you to
Nandini, but you just disappeared.

435
00:56:31,535 --> 00:56:33,025
I thought maybe...

436
00:56:33,437 --> 00:56:39,967
I'd be tongue-tied before
such a beautiful girl.

437
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:44,938
Stupid! Some things are
even said with your eyes.

438
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:50,443
Come! You must meet her.

439
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:53,347
But listen!
- I don't want to hear anything.

440
00:56:53,623 --> 00:56:54,954
What if she doesn't like me?

441
00:56:55,892 --> 00:56:59,453
She will! So what if she's fair
and you are dark...

442
00:56:59,763 --> 00:57:01,424
her eyes are blue
while yours are black...

443
00:57:01,698 --> 00:57:08,194
she sings well, but you sing
terribly even in the bathroom.

444
00:57:08,672 --> 00:57:14,633
But you have something
that no one in the world has.

445
00:57:14,911 --> 00:57:18,074
What?
- A beautiful heart.

446
00:57:20,717 --> 00:57:23,083
I have one more thing.
- What is that?

447
00:57:26,723 --> 00:57:28,452
You are avoiding the issue.

448
00:57:28,692 --> 00:57:30,660
Tell me, do you approve of
Nandini or not?

449
00:57:35,298 --> 00:57:39,826
Yes.
- Then choose one hand.

450
00:57:47,377 --> 00:57:49,607
Do it once again.

451
00:57:51,515 --> 00:57:55,474
Whichever hand I chose,
Nandini will be mine!

452
00:57:58,021 --> 00:58:00,683
Congratulations for the wedding.
- Stupid!

453
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:05,986
Anu's marriage is over,
Nandini is also a big girl now.

454
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,398
Have you given her a thought?
- What for?

455
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:13,664
I'll tell you.
Chose a hand.

456
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:20,706
How childish!
- Chose one!

457
00:58:21,645 --> 00:58:22,737
Shall I?

458
00:58:25,882 --> 00:58:28,009
I knew you'd choose this hand!

459
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:31,414
We've got a very good
proposal for Nandini.

460
00:58:31,755 --> 00:58:33,950
Proposal for Nandini?

461
00:58:34,658 --> 00:58:37,718
Yes, advocate
Vikramjeet's son, Vanraj.

462
00:58:38,228 --> 00:58:40,492
The boy is good,
even the family is nice.

463
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:42,956
We are visiting their
city for the fair anyway.

464
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,097
We'll go to their house and accept
the proposal too. What do you...

465
00:58:52,442 --> 00:58:56,936
A daughter has to go one day.

466
00:58:59,716 --> 00:59:01,115
Does he sing?

467
00:59:02,752 --> 00:59:07,416
Can't you think of anything else
other than singing? Yes, he sings.

468
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:09,591
Really?
- But he's pretty hoarse.

469
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:24,106
Meet Nandini, she ruined
the family photograph.

470
00:59:24,407 --> 00:59:27,604
Everybody is looking straight,
but she is looking up.

471
00:59:29,145 --> 00:59:33,582
Vithal, look at your photo.
- I'm not visible, only my hair is.

472
00:59:33,884 --> 00:59:37,513
Kamini look, your groom, the priest.

473
00:59:52,569 --> 00:59:55,060
Why do people eat pizzas in Italy?

474
00:59:55,906 --> 00:59:59,307
Because food made by grandma
is not available there.

475
00:59:59,709 --> 01:00:04,203
Sameer, you are a sweet talker.
- He is my sweet son.

476
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:09,945
What happened? Don't you like the
food? Nandini has cooked today.

477
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:12,381
It's a bit spicy.

478
01:00:12,656 --> 01:00:16,490
Spicy food is for spicy girls,
not for sweet fools

479
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,058
That's a great reply!

480
01:00:35,211 --> 01:00:38,578
What stupidity is this?
Stop it, Sameer!

481
01:00:38,882 --> 01:00:43,251
Don't be stubborn.
Give him some water.

482
01:00:45,355 --> 01:00:48,119
Why do you always trouble him?
Look, he has left.

483
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:52,327
What happened?
- Sameer ate a lot of chilies.

484
01:00:52,629 --> 01:00:55,223
His mouth must be on fire,
give him some honey.

485
01:00:55,532 --> 01:00:57,329
Go and apologize to him.

486
01:00:59,536 --> 01:01:04,701
He ate the chilies, but he'll
have a problem in the morning.

487
01:02:22,919 --> 01:02:24,511
A token of our love.

488
01:02:26,022 --> 01:02:30,459
This hand has been punished
for the offense it committed.

489
01:03:35,158 --> 01:03:39,219
It would be so nice if I was a
kite, I'd fly in the sky like it.

490
01:03:39,496 --> 01:03:40,963
Girls are like kites.

491
01:03:41,231 --> 01:03:43,597
Before marriage, their
parents control them.

492
01:03:43,867 --> 01:03:45,334
After marriage, it's their husbands.

493
01:03:45,602 --> 01:03:48,127
Like Anu got married,
and now, it's Nandini's turn.

494
01:03:48,905 --> 01:03:53,535
Not so soon.
- Why are you being so modest?

495
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:58,938
You are desperate to get married,
why don't you say so openly?

496
01:03:59,249 --> 01:04:01,843
Why are you so concerned,
I'll marry when I want to.

497
01:04:02,152 --> 01:04:07,784
You'll marry of your own accord?
- Of course!

498
01:04:08,224 --> 01:04:13,856
You act as is I don't know anything.
You're flying high these days.

499
01:04:14,164 --> 01:04:18,032
Some are lucky to fly high...

500
01:04:18,334 --> 01:04:21,269
while some don't even manage
to get off the ground, like you.

501
01:04:22,572 --> 01:04:25,234
That's not the way to speak
to elders, Nandini! Apologize!

502
01:04:26,142 --> 01:04:27,734
Apologize to her!

503
01:04:33,283 --> 01:04:37,185
I'm sorry, sister.
- Doesn't matter, she's immature.

504
01:04:37,554 --> 01:04:39,545
It's not that we are not
worried about her marriage.

505
01:04:39,889 --> 01:04:44,883
We've got a good proposal too. If the
horoscopes match, we'll accept it.

506
01:04:45,795 --> 01:04:47,763
Please don't mind her.
- Of course not.

507
01:04:52,368 --> 01:04:54,359
The mother is looking
for a groom...

508
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:56,866
while the daughter's
having an affair!

509
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:01,877
Forget it.

510
01:05:31,908 --> 01:05:34,809
"Let the kite loose..."

511
01:05:45,855 --> 01:05:49,655
"and when it flies higher,
pull it closer"

512
01:05:49,926 --> 01:05:52,918
"Let the kite loose..."

513
01:06:01,938 --> 01:06:07,774
"It could cut your finger..."

514
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:09,977
"so what is a kite?"

515
01:06:10,213 --> 01:06:12,909
"Let the kite loose..."

516
01:06:16,085 --> 01:06:17,780
"And when it flies higher..."

517
01:06:18,054 --> 01:06:21,546
"pull it closer"

518
01:07:38,468 --> 01:07:45,931
"Your kite has gone flying"

519
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:52,839
"It flew so high
and it was cut"

520
01:08:02,358 --> 01:08:06,226
"Be not disheartened;
try again"

521
01:08:06,529 --> 01:08:10,329
"The skies are yours...
be brave"

522
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:16,101
"He can't hang on
to the string"

523
01:08:16,372 --> 01:08:18,237
"He doesn't even know
how you tie a kite"

524
01:08:18,474 --> 01:08:22,001
"Let there be another contest;
try your tricks again"

525
01:08:22,111 --> 01:08:26,309
"The kite teaches you
to always aim high"

526
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:28,379
"That's what the kite
teaches you"

527
01:08:36,225 --> 01:08:39,092
"Let the kite loose..."

528
01:08:54,377 --> 01:08:56,709
"Let the kite loose..."

529
01:09:46,996 --> 01:09:49,794
Here you are! I cut your father's
kite today. Do you know how?

530
01:09:50,066 --> 01:09:54,002
I let my string go under your
father's kite and it fell down!

531
01:09:55,972 --> 01:09:59,066
It would be so much fun
if you were also with me.

532
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:03,072
Our kites would sway up
in the skies.

533
01:10:03,779 --> 01:10:05,508
I don't want these paper toys!

534
01:10:05,715 --> 01:10:07,774
You fly the kite while
I hold the string?

535
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:10,018
Someone will take me away
right from under your nose...

536
01:10:10,253 --> 01:10:11,379
and you'll do anything

537
01:10:11,621 --> 01:10:15,717
Of course I will!
I'll beat him to pulp!

538
01:10:16,092 --> 01:10:19,255
Do you know the taunts I have
to hear because of you?

539
01:10:22,131 --> 01:10:25,396
You're always being childish,
always taking things lightly.

540
01:10:35,144 --> 01:10:37,578
My family is talking about
getting me married.

541
01:10:38,648 --> 01:10:40,513
People will come to see me

542
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:46,521
They'll ask me show them how
I walk, sit, sing, laugh.

543
01:10:46,956 --> 01:10:53,191
And I'll have to do all that.
But you don't do anything!

544
01:10:53,596 --> 01:10:59,057
Not even when my groom
takes me away.

545
01:10:59,235 --> 01:11:03,467
Not even when I belong
to someone else.

546
01:11:04,006 --> 01:11:08,568
Not when I get married,
not even when I die!

547
01:11:23,793 --> 01:11:25,624
I'll tell your father.

548
01:11:26,062 --> 01:11:31,634
You could not tell me,
how will you tell him?

549
01:11:31,634 --> 01:11:35,161
You cannot even tell me.

550
01:11:46,282 --> 01:11:48,273
It's a sin.

551
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:53,853
It's not a sin.
- What if something happens?

552
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:58,420
What will happen?
- A baby?

553
01:11:59,795 --> 01:12:04,164
Babies don't happen like this.
- But this isn't right.

554
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:10,436
Father won't accept.
- Why won't he?

555
01:12:12,642 --> 01:12:17,011
This isn't a sin, is it?
- No, it isn't.

556
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:20,577
You won't leave me?
- Never.

557
01:12:32,828 --> 01:12:34,125
Someone is here.

558
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:35,988
Where are you going?
- I must go.

559
01:12:38,701 --> 01:12:40,635
Aunt?

560
01:12:40,936 --> 01:12:43,837
I came looking for a book,
I feel like reading today.

561
01:12:44,106 --> 01:12:46,666
Which book?
- But what are you doing here?

562
01:12:47,043 --> 01:12:49,807
Aren't you flying kites?
It's real fun.

563
01:12:50,112 --> 01:12:55,379
I'd come to straighten things here
- First straighten your clothes.

564
01:12:56,652 --> 01:12:59,849
Mind your own business, aunt.

565
01:13:01,524 --> 01:13:08,555
Don't act smart with me. The day
I get tough, you'll be in trouble.

566
01:13:09,665 --> 01:13:14,466
Found it! How's this book?
- It's in English.

567
01:13:15,438 --> 01:13:19,738
So what, I'll have to
even learn Italian now.

568
01:13:23,245 --> 01:13:25,611
Congratulations!
The horoscopes match.

569
01:13:30,753 --> 01:13:33,847
Congratulations!
- To you too!

570
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:36,285
Do the horoscopes match?
- Yes, perfectly!

571
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:40,588
See! I told you.

572
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:42,488
Give sweets to everyone.

573
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:46,532
First let me give the one
who's getting married.

574
01:13:46,869 --> 01:13:51,203
Look how shy he is.
- Wait!

575
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:55,806
You cannot become my son-in-law
just because the horoscopes match.

576
01:13:56,112 --> 01:14:01,846
You're marrying a singer's daughter,
let me check if you can sing.

577
01:14:02,118 --> 01:14:05,781
Sing for me.
- Sing?

578
01:14:06,021 --> 01:14:10,617
Of course! You'll have to sing.
I have to take this test.

579
01:14:10,893 --> 01:14:12,053
Go ahead and sing, my son.

580
01:14:12,361 --> 01:14:15,922
Even we'll ask Nandini
to argue like a lawyer...

581
01:14:16,098 --> 01:14:17,030
before the marriage takes place.

582
01:14:18,601 --> 01:14:19,863
How about a song then?

583
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:32,974
"A spark the rains
extinguish..."

584
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:45,855
"but what the rains start a fire...
how douses it?"

585
01:14:46,662 --> 01:14:53,932
Enough. You lack melody, but
my daughter will teach you that.

586
01:14:54,270 --> 01:15:01,733
But there is a truthfulness
in your voice which assures me...

587
01:15:02,244 --> 01:15:05,475
that you'll keep my daughter happy.

588
01:15:10,186 --> 01:15:12,051
The sky is shining with lights.

589
01:15:12,822 --> 01:15:18,089
It seems like thousands of lovers are
carrying lights in their hands, grandma.

590
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:23,926
Lovers don't need lights to shine.
- How do you know, grandma?

591
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:29,263
Love told me.
- Had you ever loved?

592
01:15:29,672 --> 01:15:33,699
Love lures everybody,
nobody can escape it.

593
01:15:35,678 --> 01:15:41,981
Did you have a love marriage?
- No, I married and then fell in love

594
01:15:42,484 --> 01:15:46,682
Tell us about it.

595
01:15:46,889 --> 01:15:53,624
I was barely 14 when I got married.
I was combing my hair one day...

596
01:15:53,696 --> 01:15:56,392
and your grandpa
was flying a kite...

597
01:15:56,799 --> 01:16:00,200
when your grandpa slipped
and fell from the terrace.

598
01:16:00,402 --> 01:16:03,633
I ran towards him.
I saw him holding on to the parapet.

599
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:05,767
I extended my hand.

600
01:16:06,008 --> 01:16:10,775
The moment he touched me,
a current ran through me.

601
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,274
Then?

602
01:16:12,581 --> 01:16:17,985
Then our eyes met
and we fell in love.

603
01:16:18,487 --> 01:16:22,821
That was the first time
he kissed me.

604
01:16:23,092 --> 01:16:29,088
And you became pregnant?
- You don't get pregnant by kissing.

605
01:16:32,868 --> 01:16:36,099
Then?
- Then we had a family.

606
01:16:37,706 --> 01:16:40,834
We were very happy.

607
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:42,132
Then?

608
01:16:42,444 --> 01:16:48,178
Then my children got married,
we had lots of celebrations.

609
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:51,410
Then?
- You all came along.

610
01:16:51,687 --> 01:16:52,915
Then?

611
01:16:53,188 --> 01:17:00,560
Then I sang lullabies for you all,
you laughed, you cried.

612
01:17:00,963 --> 01:17:05,991
Then?
- Then nothing.

613
01:17:06,235 --> 01:17:07,600
Then?

614
01:17:11,707 --> 01:17:12,833
Then?

615
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:22,811
Then?

616
01:17:23,152 --> 01:17:27,885
After 60 years, two lovers
met again on the same terrace.

617
01:17:28,057 --> 01:17:32,585
And grandma caught them!

618
01:17:40,803 --> 01:17:44,398
Your father always wanted
a singer husband for you.

619
01:17:44,707 --> 01:17:51,203
Maybe that's your dream too. That's
why I want to tell you something.

620
01:17:52,481 --> 01:17:57,180
Even I've been thinking of telling
you something since several days.

621
01:17:57,853 --> 01:18:01,152
Shall I?
- Yes.

622
01:18:01,857 --> 01:18:06,328
But you'll have to promise that you
won't get angry after you hear me.

623
01:18:06,328 --> 01:18:14,360
Angry? Why?
- Actually...

624
01:18:15,504 --> 01:18:18,200
Anu is back from her in-laws.

625
01:18:18,507 --> 01:18:20,737
She's in a very bad state.
Come down quickly

626
01:18:23,212 --> 01:18:30,277
Get this clear Anu,
you'll have to go back.

627
01:18:30,586 --> 01:18:34,716
No father, come what may,
I'll not go back there.

628
01:18:35,324 --> 01:18:38,088
You'll have to forget
about Bharat and go back.

629
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:41,320
I'd rather die, but I'll
never return to that house.

630
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:46,331
I don't want to spend my nights
like a corpse in that man's bed.

631
01:18:47,336 --> 01:18:50,669
A daughter has to marry
as per her father's wishes.

632
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:54,272
After marriage, a husband
means everything to a woman...

633
01:18:54,576 --> 01:18:57,204
that's the norm.

634
01:18:57,813 --> 01:19:00,782
Anu will return after Holi.

635
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:05,721
No! Send her back right away.

636
01:19:05,721 --> 01:19:10,351
Her sight makes me...
- Stop!

637
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:14,992
We don't hit grown up girls
in our family.

638
01:19:15,364 --> 01:19:21,860
By Holi, things will cool down.
Anu will definitely return after that

639
01:19:22,171 --> 01:19:25,207
She won't be happy there, father.
Look how they have beaten her.

640
01:19:25,207 --> 01:19:30,110
Nandini, kids are not supposed
to interfere in elders matters.

641
01:19:30,379 --> 01:19:32,381
It's her life, ask her.

642
01:19:32,381 --> 01:19:34,246
Nandini, go away.

643
01:19:34,516 --> 01:19:36,950
How can she live with
a man she doesn't love?

644
01:19:37,186 --> 01:19:40,212
Nandini, leave!

645
01:19:44,726 --> 01:19:45,488
Leave!

646
01:19:55,838 --> 01:19:58,500
Sameer has arranged for everything,
Bharat must be waiting for you.

647
01:19:59,174 --> 01:20:02,200
Come on, hurry!
- What is all this?

648
01:20:04,446 --> 01:20:06,573
Am I doing the right thing?

649
01:20:07,182 --> 01:20:10,618
The family reputation...
what if something happens to Bharat?

650
01:20:10,886 --> 01:20:13,184
This is not the time to think about
that. You are doing the right thing.

651
01:20:13,889 --> 01:20:16,255
This is your life, you have
a right to live it your way.

652
01:20:21,063 --> 01:20:22,553
Is everything arranged?
- Yes.

653
01:20:28,637 --> 01:20:33,301
Are you afraid?
I am afraid of your father.

654
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:42,475
Let's go.

655
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:51,252
Hurry, Bharat is
waiting outside the temple.

656
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,265
Idiot! There is no cat
in this house.

657
01:21:13,048 --> 01:21:17,576
Anu must be so happy,
we did such a good thing for them.

658
01:21:17,853 --> 01:21:21,414
This is all very romantic.
Even we must sprint and get married.

659
01:21:21,723 --> 01:21:23,953
Sprint?
- I mean, elope.

660
01:21:24,193 --> 01:21:27,390
Even before your family realizes,
we'll be in Italy.

661
01:21:27,596 --> 01:21:31,433
But why should we elope? You'll have
to ask father for my hand in marriage.

662
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:36,393
Just think! We'll get
married in everyone's presence.

663
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:42,602
Where has Anu gone?
- I don't know anything.

664
01:21:43,011 --> 01:21:44,945
You know everything.
Is that why we employed you?!

665
01:21:46,515 --> 01:21:48,676
Tell me, or I'll kill you!

666
01:22:09,738 --> 01:22:11,173
Bhairon! Why are you beating him?

667
01:22:11,173 --> 01:22:14,199
Even you are responsible for this.
- What are you saying?

668
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:18,435
I'd told you to send Anu back
immediately, but you didn't listen.

669
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:21,214
I did the right thing.
- Right thing? Nonsense!

670
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:23,213
Anu ran away with another man.

671
01:22:23,518 --> 01:22:25,816
Look, her wedding chain
and this letter.

672
01:22:26,255 --> 01:22:30,419
She has scorned all
of us, especially you.

673
01:22:30,692 --> 01:22:31,056
Lower your voice!

674
01:22:32,527 --> 01:22:36,293
You are elder to us, so you cannot
tolerate anyone telling you anything.

675
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:39,592
What right do you have to
force your decisions on us?

676
01:22:39,868 --> 01:22:42,132
You make mistakes
and we have to suffer.

677
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:47,765
It's your fault. You didn't teach
your kids the family norms...

678
01:22:48,076 --> 01:22:50,476
...now you are misbehaving.
- I'm not misbehaving!

679
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:55,878
You'll understand how I feel when
Nandini runs away with someone.

680
01:22:56,885 --> 01:22:58,785
Don't cross your limits!

681
01:22:59,021 --> 01:23:02,320
He's right. Before blaming others,
take care of your own family.

682
01:23:02,591 --> 01:23:10,020
You'll be ashamed the day you
know what your daughter is up to.

683
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:15,359
Stop it! Don't any of you dare
badmouth about Nandini.

684
01:23:16,905 --> 01:23:22,366
I trust Nandini,
I take pride in her.

685
01:23:22,577 --> 01:23:25,705
She's as pure as my music.

686
01:23:26,448 --> 01:23:31,647
If I find her doing anything wrong,
assume my music will die forever.

687
01:23:32,487 --> 01:23:37,392
I'll never sing after that.
- If you trust her so much...

688
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:42,796
call her here right away
and get things clarified.

689
01:23:55,043 --> 01:23:57,512
She'll hear you only
if she's home.

690
01:23:57,512 --> 01:23:59,742
Nandini, where are you?

691
01:24:00,315 --> 01:24:05,947
Go out and see what
your daughter is up to.

692
01:24:13,195 --> 01:24:18,724
In the first vow, we'll promise to
share all our happiness and sorrows.

693
01:24:19,701 --> 01:24:23,694
In the second vow,
you'll promise to protect...

694
01:24:23,905 --> 01:24:29,901
Iove, respect, and cherish me.

695
01:24:35,884 --> 01:24:41,345
In the fourth vow, I'll take
your permission to go ahead...

696
01:24:41,623 --> 01:24:45,491
so that when death arrives,
I can embrace it before you.

697
01:24:46,895 --> 01:24:50,262
When death arrives,
we'll embrace it together.

698
01:25:19,294 --> 01:25:22,821
We didn't expect this from you.
What have you done?

699
01:25:23,532 --> 01:25:30,131
This has been happening for eight
months and we don't even know?!

700
01:25:31,807 --> 01:25:33,502
You didn't even tell me?

701
01:25:34,543 --> 01:25:35,942
I've begun to hate him!

702
01:25:36,077 --> 01:25:38,170
I'd never thought he'd do this.
- People get obsessed in love.

703
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,540
I experience
the same obsession.

704
01:25:41,983 --> 01:25:44,281
I just didn't realize
when I fell in love.

705
01:25:49,658 --> 01:25:53,389
No one has the right to
fall in love in this house.

706
01:25:54,229 --> 01:25:58,757
We live by certain norms.
People respect your father.

707
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,771
He was disgraced because
of you today, only you.

708
01:26:02,771 --> 01:26:04,898
You didn't even...

709
01:26:05,273 --> 01:26:09,835
Who knew a small meeting would
develop into such a deep relationship.

710
01:26:11,847 --> 01:26:16,341
Sameer says father loves him,
I'm sure he'll accept.

711
01:26:16,585 --> 01:26:18,849
He won't.

712
01:26:23,024 --> 01:26:27,324
Your marriage with Vanraj has been
finalized. We've given them our word.

713
01:26:27,596 --> 01:26:31,225
When I was explaining the
marriage rites to him...

714
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:35,163
it felt as if the whole
Universe was celebrating.

715
01:26:36,104 --> 01:26:44,136
Marriage rites? How far
has your relationship gone?

716
01:26:45,113 --> 01:26:48,776
Have you done anything
that could embarrass us?

717
01:26:49,584 --> 01:26:56,157
Has he touched you?
Tell me!

718
01:26:56,157 --> 01:27:06,726
Here... and here...

719
01:27:08,236 --> 01:27:11,728
...here...
- Stop it, Nandini!

720
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:21,745
He has touched my soul.
His eyes follow me everywhere.

721
01:27:22,017 --> 01:27:24,986
Don't separate us, I won't be
able to live without him.

722
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:30,886
I love him very much,
I can only belong to him.

723
01:27:31,126 --> 01:27:34,926
Control yourself!

724
01:27:35,196 --> 01:27:39,895
Help me, mother. Convince dad.
- Calm down! Listen to me!

725
01:27:41,136 --> 01:27:44,196
I'll try to convince your father.

726
01:27:45,006 --> 01:27:49,636
But until I return,
you will not budge from here.

727
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:58,451
I have quit singing...

728
01:27:59,955 --> 01:28:05,791
and therefore, I have
nothing to teach you now.

729
01:28:07,729 --> 01:28:14,464
Sir, it is our mistake,
why are you punishing yourself?

730
01:28:14,936 --> 01:28:17,996
I have done nothing wrong. I was
going to ask for Nandini's hand...

731
01:28:18,306 --> 01:28:20,968
It's time for you to pay your fees.

732
01:28:21,843 --> 01:28:25,370
For the sake of all the knowledge
that I've given you until now...

733
01:28:26,081 --> 01:28:33,647
promise that henceforth,
you'll neither meet Nandini...

734
01:28:34,923 --> 01:28:38,950
nor will you try to keep
any relationship with her.

735
01:28:41,162 --> 01:28:43,630
That is the fees I want.

736
01:29:08,156 --> 01:29:20,330
"Love for you it was that
brought my heart to life"

737
01:29:20,635 --> 01:29:31,739
"Love for you it is
that has ruined my heart"

738
01:29:33,682 --> 01:29:38,847
Nandini, Sameer is going.

739
01:29:41,623 --> 01:29:47,562
Your father didn't agree.
He's not ready to hear anything.

740
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:54,835
He has only permitted you to
see him once while he leaves.

741
01:29:55,637 --> 01:29:58,572
Get up, Nandini.

742
01:30:01,142 --> 01:30:04,134
Sameer is leaving forever.

743
01:30:04,412 --> 01:30:10,408
See him one last time,
maybe you'll never see him again.

744
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:14,880
Go, Nandini.

745
01:31:12,413 --> 01:31:16,247
"Of sufferance
my heart cried..."

746
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:19,009
"I have been punished
for falling in love"

747
01:31:19,254 --> 01:31:20,812
"And what was my crime?"

748
01:31:21,122 --> 01:31:24,956
"I have been ruined..."

749
01:31:25,326 --> 01:31:29,695
"I have been ruined for
falling in love with you"

750
01:31:30,031 --> 01:31:34,468
"Of sufferance my heart wept..."

751
01:31:34,669 --> 01:31:37,160
"I have been punished
for falling in love"

752
01:31:37,405 --> 01:31:38,838
"And what sin have I committed?"

753
01:31:39,107 --> 01:31:48,072
"Devastated I have been,
by falling in love with you"

754
01:31:48,249 --> 01:31:52,185
"Of sufferance my heart cries..."

755
01:31:52,520 --> 01:32:05,957
"In love with you,
I have been ruined"

756
01:32:26,354 --> 01:32:35,524
"Strange is love..."

757
01:32:35,663 --> 01:32:44,401
"where happiness lasts
but for a few moments..."

758
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:48,076
"Sorrows one gets"

759
01:32:48,076 --> 01:32:53,343
"And Ionely one is"

760
01:32:54,115 --> 01:32:59,018
"Tears and sorrow, grief
and grievances it entails"

761
01:32:59,287 --> 01:33:02,313
"Your face it is that
I see everywhere"

762
01:33:02,724 --> 01:33:07,491
"Your face, I see everywhere"

763
01:33:07,762 --> 01:33:10,526
"Your memories
torment me"

764
01:33:11,499 --> 01:33:13,797
"Your memories torment me..."

765
01:33:14,068 --> 01:33:19,370
"Your face haunts me
in the darkness of the nights"

766
01:33:20,108 --> 01:33:24,169
"In sufferance my heart cries..."

767
01:33:24,412 --> 01:33:26,505
"I have been punished
for loving"

768
01:33:26,681 --> 01:33:28,740
"What was my sin?"

769
01:33:29,017 --> 01:33:33,147
"I am devastated"

770
01:33:33,488 --> 01:33:38,289
"I am ruined in my love for you"

771
01:34:18,599 --> 01:34:19,896
They have come.

772
01:34:37,285 --> 01:34:42,245
Welcome!
- Hello!

773
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:45,022
You almost disappeared
after fixing the alliance.

774
01:34:50,164 --> 01:34:56,467
Actually, we were busy
with the wedding preparations.

775
01:34:56,771 --> 01:35:00,241
Even we were busy with that We even
have the invitation cards ready.

776
01:35:00,241 --> 01:35:05,144
Our first invitation
and the first card is for you.

777
01:35:06,614 --> 01:35:09,276
The card is very pretty,
have a look.

778
01:35:12,186 --> 01:35:17,089
It is indeed pretty.
Thank you.

779
01:35:17,358 --> 01:35:19,383
Thank us later,
first let us talk about dowry.

780
01:35:19,727 --> 01:35:22,696
What?
- Of course we'll take dowry...

781
01:35:22,997 --> 01:35:25,659
we've fixed our son's alliance with
the daughter of a renowned singer

782
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:29,063
What do you say?
- As you wish.

783
01:35:29,404 --> 01:35:32,464
Our dowry will be that
you'll sing at the wedding.

784
01:35:35,209 --> 01:35:39,475
I may not be able
to sing on that day...

785
01:35:40,515 --> 01:35:47,819
but Vanraj surely will,
he must have learnt by now.

786
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:52,354
Vanraj will only
sing for Nandini now.

787
01:35:53,494 --> 01:35:58,056
Auntie, where is Nandini?
Brother has been looking for her.

788
01:35:58,833 --> 01:36:01,301
She's upstairs in her room,
she's not feeling well.

789
01:36:01,602 --> 01:36:02,830
What happened?

790
01:36:03,104 --> 01:36:06,437
She fell from the stairs.
It's nothing serious though.

791
01:36:15,149 --> 01:36:20,951
"My dear Nandu, living without
you is almost impossible"

792
01:36:22,123 --> 01:36:28,653
"It's time we wrote
our own destiny"

793
01:36:30,398 --> 01:36:34,767
"I am sure my love
will bring you to me"

794
01:36:38,206 --> 01:36:42,609
"I'll wait for you,
yours, tangy lemon!"

795
01:36:47,215 --> 01:36:56,055
"I can't believe you didn't come.
But I am sure you will come one day"

796
01:36:56,390 --> 01:37:00,383
"You have my heart; take care of it,
and do come to return it to me"

797
01:37:00,761 --> 01:37:05,460
"Your Sameer - the wind
that has stopped blowing"

798
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:45,189
We are beginning a new
life together today.

799
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:54,670
Why don't we begin it truthfully...

800
01:38:56,177 --> 01:39:02,275
because truth is the
foundation of every relationship.

801
01:39:04,685 --> 01:39:12,057
Maybe I shouldn't be
saying this right now.

802
01:39:14,462 --> 01:39:19,900
Actually, I have no words
to describe how beautiful you are.

803
01:39:28,976 --> 01:39:35,779
You must be wondering that you
are so beautiful and mischievous...

804
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:43,957
how could you marry this man
who is so reserved and quiet.

805
01:39:44,925 --> 01:39:52,388
Is he proud, or is he trying
to prove he's intelligent?

806
01:39:55,469 --> 01:39:59,166
Do you know? I'm the son
of a famous lawyer...

807
01:39:59,974 --> 01:40:04,604
but I lose my cases very often

808
01:40:04,845 --> 01:40:08,042
The truth is that
I cannot stand lies.

809
01:40:10,951 --> 01:40:15,047
I can tolerate anything, but lies.

810
01:40:29,236 --> 01:40:35,607
I've to be up at four in the morning
for prayers. Can I go to sleep?

811
01:41:47,782 --> 01:41:50,945
What happened?
Have I done something wrong?

812
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:55,050
We are married and
are husband and wife...

813
01:41:57,491 --> 01:42:00,483
If a husband and wife's relationship
only means this, then all right...

814
01:42:00,995 --> 01:42:03,486
What nonsense are you talking?
Have you gone crazy?

815
01:42:06,367 --> 01:42:11,100
Marriage is not physical union,
but the union of minds, of souls.

816
01:42:11,439 --> 01:42:16,138
Since we've been married, I feel you
aren't the Nandini I'd seen before.

817
01:42:19,046 --> 01:42:23,608
Have you been forced into this
marriage, or don't you like me?

818
01:42:23,918 --> 01:42:24,752
Or is it something else?

819
01:42:24,752 --> 01:42:28,119
Tell me Nandini,
tell me before it's too late.

820
01:42:28,422 --> 01:42:30,617
Before we are forced to carry the
burden of this relationship for life.

821
01:42:36,096 --> 01:42:41,193
I've told you this before,
I cannot stand lies.

822
01:42:42,236 --> 01:42:46,366
Tell me Nandini,
I'll support you.

823
01:42:48,642 --> 01:42:50,337
Speak, Nandini!

824
01:42:54,548 --> 01:42:56,675
You won't gain anything
by staying silent.

825
01:42:56,951 --> 01:43:02,150
Brother! Open the door.

826
01:43:03,157 --> 01:43:04,988
Hurry! Open the door.

827
01:43:10,264 --> 01:43:13,290
Switch off the alarm or you'll
awaken the entire neighborhood.

828
01:43:16,036 --> 01:43:20,939
And if brother bothers you again,
tell him it's time for the prayers.

829
01:43:22,343 --> 01:43:25,437
Get dressed and come quickly.
- All right.

830
01:43:26,213 --> 01:43:29,114
Come soon, sister-in-law.

831
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:40,082
A woman fasts on this day
for her husband's long life.

832
01:43:40,761 --> 01:43:43,559
Is there any greater pleasure
than having a husband?

833
01:43:43,831 --> 01:43:48,564
That's all okay, but where
is the moon, I'm so hungry!

834
01:43:49,370 --> 01:43:53,329
I think the moon will
make us wait long today.

835
01:43:53,674 --> 01:43:58,668
It's hiding behind the clouds. It had
disappeared like this even last year.

836
01:43:59,013 --> 01:44:01,311
Look, the moon!

837
01:44:03,183 --> 01:44:06,730
You liar! We're hungry anyway.
And you're teasing us.

838
01:44:16,730 --> 01:44:23,135
"You have put it to shame,
my love"

839
01:44:40,187 --> 01:44:44,590
"No, Moon... do not show up;
should you show up..."

840
01:44:44,892 --> 01:44:48,453
"my beloved might go away
out of shyness"

841
01:44:48,963 --> 01:44:53,866
"Show up, O Moon...
May you be blessed"

842
01:44:54,101 --> 01:44:59,334
"Do not show up, Moon...
my beloved will go away"

843
01:45:09,650 --> 01:45:15,282
"Let me hide in that veil...
- No"

844
01:45:15,556 --> 01:45:21,085
"Let me lie in those dark tresses...
- No"

845
01:45:21,428 --> 01:45:26,866
"Love is patience, my love"

846
01:45:27,134 --> 01:45:32,265
"How can I be patient anymore?"

847
01:45:32,539 --> 01:45:36,373
"Wait, like the peacock
awaits the rains..."

848
01:45:39,513 --> 01:45:45,884
"Let things be...
do not turn your face away"

849
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:49,385
"This is yet something else..."

850
01:47:02,262 --> 01:47:06,392
So much!
- It's nothing at all.

851
01:47:07,868 --> 01:47:08,902
You shouldn't have
brought so many things.

852
01:47:08,902 --> 01:47:10,961
Don't embarrass me.

853
01:47:11,271 --> 01:47:14,502
Actually, I was missing Nandini
very much, so I came to meet her.

854
01:47:14,775 --> 01:47:18,074
Since she has come here,
she's been the soul of the house.

855
01:47:19,012 --> 01:47:21,105
Nandini, look who's here.

856
01:47:24,785 --> 01:47:28,186
Your mother probably thinks
we don't look after you.

857
01:47:28,422 --> 01:47:30,151
It's not that.

858
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:32,881
The two of you sit and chat,
I'll just be back.

859
01:47:36,230 --> 01:47:39,757
How are you, dear?

860
01:47:41,735 --> 01:47:47,230
Everybody misses you
so much at home.

861
01:47:47,541 --> 01:47:50,339
Your father asked me
to look you up.

862
01:47:50,878 --> 01:47:56,544
What did he want to see? That
I'm still alive or have I died?

863
01:47:57,251 --> 01:48:00,277
You're still stuck on that?
Come with me!

864
01:48:01,922 --> 01:48:07,087
What's this? You aren't dressed up,
and you haven't even made your hair.

865
01:48:07,394 --> 01:48:08,529
Don't forget you are a new bride.

866
01:48:08,529 --> 01:48:12,863
You have such a good husband and
in-laws, what more can you ask for?

867
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:15,469
Don't ruin everything
because of your stupidity.

868
01:48:15,469 --> 01:48:18,836
I'll ruin myself too.
Even Sameer...

869
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:21,942
Sameer? You shouldn't even
be uttering his name now.

870
01:48:21,942 --> 01:48:24,308
Do you know what you're doing?

871
01:48:25,345 --> 01:48:30,715
You're still holding on
to the past. Let it go.

872
01:48:31,051 --> 01:48:34,817
Or by the time you realize,
you'll have nothing left.

873
01:48:37,124 --> 01:48:43,324
Life is ever changing,
accept the change.

874
01:48:43,664 --> 01:48:47,430
Accept Vanraj, he's your husband.

875
01:48:48,135 --> 01:48:50,296
I can never accept him
as my husband

876
01:48:50,637 --> 01:48:54,971
You'll have to accept him. And why
aren't you wearing your mangalsutra?

877
01:48:56,910 --> 01:49:01,609
They only mean black beads to you,
but the day you realize their worth...

878
01:49:02,115 --> 01:49:04,640
you'll know powerful,
how important they are.

879
01:49:10,757 --> 01:49:12,952
They may be important for you,
but they are a burden on me.

880
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:16,092
Why don't you try to understand?

881
01:49:17,998 --> 01:49:20,865
And then, Kaushalya
and I laughed so much...

882
01:49:21,201 --> 01:49:25,729
What are you laughing about?
Share the joke.

883
01:49:26,907 --> 01:49:31,037
It was nothing.
I'll take your leave.

884
01:49:31,378 --> 01:49:32,777
But you didn't eat anything.

885
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:37,549
We don't even drink water at our
daughter's place, or you'll taunt her.

886
01:49:37,851 --> 01:49:40,445
Of course I will!
I'm her mother-in-law after all.

887
01:49:46,126 --> 01:49:49,857
They'll leave for their honeymoon as
soon as Vanraj's court case is over.

888
01:49:50,197 --> 01:49:52,495
Send Nandini home after that.
- Sure.

889
01:49:52,766 --> 01:49:54,393
Give my regards to your husband.

890
01:49:54,635 --> 01:49:56,330
Nandini, come here.

891
01:49:59,907 --> 01:50:02,205
These are some letters
from Sameer.

892
01:50:02,843 --> 01:50:04,276
Sameer's letters?

893
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:05,306
When did he send them?

894
01:50:05,545 --> 01:50:07,814
Some before your marriage,
and some, after.

895
01:50:07,814 --> 01:50:13,980
But I feared to give them to you.
- That means Sameer was there then.

896
01:50:14,588 --> 01:50:17,751
You should have given me then,
maybe something could have been done.

897
01:50:17,991 --> 01:50:20,861
I didn't get a chance,
it was too late by then.

898
01:50:20,861 --> 01:50:23,659
It's never too late in love.

899
01:50:24,231 --> 01:50:29,100
Maybe we would have met.
- But Sameer would never meet you...

900
01:50:29,536 --> 01:50:32,801
because your father asked him
to promise never to meet you.

901
01:50:33,974 --> 01:50:38,274
He had promised father, I hadn't.
I could have met him.

902
01:50:38,812 --> 01:50:43,374
Take my advice and
burn all these letters.

903
01:50:43,817 --> 01:50:46,047
Vithal!
- Coming!

904
01:50:46,553 --> 01:50:47,850
Burn them.

905
01:51:04,338 --> 01:51:06,306
Nandini, I'm going to the temple.

906
01:51:06,606 --> 01:51:07,436
Will you come along?
- No.

907
01:51:43,010 --> 01:51:46,813
I was going to tell you...
- I'd told you I cannot stand lies!

908
01:51:46,813 --> 01:51:50,544
You had no right to humiliate me
and my family like this.

909
01:51:50,951 --> 01:51:53,887
You cannot live here anymore.
Come. Come!

910
01:51:53,887 --> 01:51:58,290
What are you doing?
Listen to me!

911
01:51:58,558 --> 01:52:03,086
Please!
Where are you taking me?

912
01:52:06,433 --> 01:52:08,663
Let me explain.

913
01:52:13,407 --> 01:52:16,638
Where are you taking me?

914
01:52:30,724 --> 01:52:35,024
Have you gone mad? You want to take
your wife to Italy to her lover?

915
01:52:35,395 --> 01:52:40,767
People will laugh at you,
and at all of us.

916
01:52:40,767 --> 01:52:42,758
What made you take this decision?

917
01:52:47,207 --> 01:52:53,043
Nandini loves someone else.
She doesn't belong to me.

918
01:52:54,014 --> 01:52:59,953
Do you want your son to live in
sorrow just to please the world?

919
01:53:00,687 --> 01:53:05,522
You are a man,
can't you keep a woman in control?

920
01:53:05,859 --> 01:53:06,791
What happened to your manhood?

921
01:53:13,467 --> 01:53:19,770
Is manhood proved by forcibly
robbing a woman of her happiness?

922
01:53:21,541 --> 01:53:25,637
Is manhood another name for
running away from the truth?

923
01:53:27,414 --> 01:53:32,113
Is manhood living with a woman
who's body belongs to you...

924
01:53:32,619 --> 01:53:36,282
but whose heart and soul
belongs to someone else?

925
01:53:39,392 --> 01:53:40,620
Tell me.

926
01:53:50,504 --> 01:53:55,407
Manhood is facing problems,
facing the truth.

927
01:53:58,145 --> 01:53:59,908
Words. Mere words.
I hear them in court every day.

928
01:54:02,482 --> 01:54:05,280
They are very easy to speak,
but very difficult to fulfill.

929
01:54:05,719 --> 01:54:07,118
Will you be able to
bear that moment...

930
01:54:07,854 --> 01:54:12,621
when you give away your wife,
whom you love so much, to another man?

931
01:54:17,430 --> 01:54:19,125
Love isn't selfish.

932
01:54:21,201 --> 01:54:26,901
It lies, not in your happiness, but
in the happiness of the one you love.

933
01:54:29,676 --> 01:54:33,942
I know that moment will
be very painful for me...

934
01:54:38,084 --> 01:54:42,851
...but her one smile
will erase all my pain.

935
01:54:48,628 --> 01:54:52,496
I will need your support
and blessings then.

936
01:55:01,374 --> 01:55:07,745
I may be a great lawyer,
but you are a greater human.

937
01:55:10,984 --> 01:55:13,953
And I am sure you
will win this case.

938
01:55:22,562 --> 01:55:29,968
"My love... O, my master"

939
01:55:30,237 --> 01:55:34,970
"My love..."

940
01:55:50,156 --> 01:55:58,996
"My love..."

941
01:56:15,215 --> 01:56:23,145
"I come to you,
seeking love, my love"

942
01:56:23,356 --> 01:56:26,154
"My love, my master"

943
01:56:43,710 --> 01:56:44,699
Come.

944
01:56:48,948 --> 01:56:52,884
It's very difficult to find a
stranger in such a big city...

945
01:56:53,186 --> 01:56:55,484
that too, without
even having his photograph.

946
01:57:02,762 --> 01:57:05,458
Don't worry, we'll find him.

947
01:57:07,067 --> 01:57:10,059
Get ready, we'll have to
make a beginning somewhere.

948
01:57:26,319 --> 01:57:30,449
I think we may find out something
from a music shop or music school.

949
01:57:30,890 --> 01:57:32,585
I'll get the addresses
from the manager.

950
01:57:35,395 --> 01:57:40,423
You've probably forgotten the
combination. I'll open it for you.

951
01:57:40,734 --> 01:57:42,031
No, thanks.

952
01:57:58,718 --> 01:58:00,049
Get dressed.

953
01:58:09,329 --> 01:58:11,320
The tram has arrived, let's go.

954
01:58:56,643 --> 01:58:57,701
Shall we go?

955
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:02,375
Wait here while I go
and ask inside.

956
01:59:28,441 --> 01:59:34,903
"My love..."

957
01:59:53,366 --> 01:59:54,890
What happened?

958
02:00:58,765 --> 02:01:01,666
Nandini, he's here.

959
02:01:53,119 --> 02:01:57,112
You are finding it very difficult to
find a stranger in such a big city.

960
02:01:58,458 --> 02:02:02,861
So it becomes necessary
to know how Sameer looks.

961
02:02:04,764 --> 02:02:06,493
He looks like this.

962
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:11,233
Maybe you'll even laugh
more now, won't you?

963
02:02:12,171 --> 02:02:16,733
Because all this is a joke for you,
even I'm a joke for you.

964
02:02:21,114 --> 02:02:25,710
I wasn't laughing at you
or Sameer, that musician...

965
02:02:38,865 --> 02:02:39,991
He's asking you something.

966
02:02:48,041 --> 02:03:20,934
Here, have the sandwich.

967
02:03:24,377 --> 02:03:26,277
Don't be stubborn,
eat the sandwich.

968
02:04:04,150 --> 02:04:05,174
Have some water.

969
02:04:06,552 --> 02:04:07,610
Drink it!

970
02:04:56,602 --> 02:04:57,660
Look at this!

971
02:06:27,994 --> 02:06:31,020
Haven't you seen such a big tram?
You were running like crazy.

972
02:06:31,297 --> 02:06:34,755
Yes, I've gone mad. I have
lost Sameer because of you today!

973
02:06:35,001 --> 02:06:37,595
Because of me? Thank your stars
that you were saved or...

974
02:06:37,904 --> 02:06:41,965
I would have died!
So what? What would you lose?

975
02:06:42,241 --> 02:06:43,731
Yes, I'd lose nothing!

976
02:06:45,811 --> 02:06:51,272
Remember, until you reach your goal,
your safety is my responsibility.

977
02:06:51,550 --> 02:06:54,883
Who gave you that responsibility?
Who asked you to bring me here?

978
02:06:55,254 --> 02:06:59,350
What relationship do we share?
There is nothing between us.

979
02:07:01,193 --> 02:07:03,161
Why are you trying to play God?

980
02:07:03,462 --> 02:07:06,165
Why are you playing this
game of finding Sameer for me?

981
02:07:06,165 --> 02:07:10,829
You want to impress upon me
that you are great, you are God?

982
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:13,295
I don't want God.

983
02:07:14,307 --> 02:07:15,865
I'm not trying to be God.

984
02:07:20,279 --> 02:07:22,042
Because you are suffering.

985
02:07:22,848 --> 02:07:27,217
And I'm going to lose both ways
in what you think is a game.

986
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:31,087
Do you know why?
Because I...

987
02:07:35,728 --> 02:07:37,355
How would you ever know
what love is.

988
02:09:25,037 --> 02:09:28,871
Shall I say something?
- Yes.

989
02:09:29,241 --> 02:09:34,076
I'm sorry for whatever
happened yesterday.

990
02:09:39,752 --> 02:09:41,743
Shall I say something?
- Yes.

991
02:09:42,388 --> 02:09:44,652
You're reading the
magazine up side down.

992
02:09:51,330 --> 02:09:54,390
Shall I say something more?
- Yes.

993
02:09:54,733 --> 02:10:00,035
You were right, there is
no relationship between us.

994
02:10:01,707 --> 02:10:04,437
But we can have one.

995
02:10:13,619 --> 02:10:15,951
Shall I say something?
- Yes.

996
02:10:16,689 --> 02:10:20,216
You are a very nice man.
- I know.

997
02:10:25,097 --> 02:10:31,093
You have a sweet smile.
Keep smiling.

998
02:10:32,705 --> 02:10:36,937
I'd thought I'd forgotten to smile.

999
02:10:38,310 --> 02:10:41,473
If you ever want to laugh, come
to court with me, it's great fun.

1000
02:10:42,047 --> 02:10:44,242
Really? Tell me about it.

1001
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:47,548
Silly questions are asked
during cross questioning.

1002
02:10:48,187 --> 02:10:51,918
Once a lawyer asked an accused that
he's clearly visible in the photo...

1003
02:10:52,224 --> 02:10:56,183
but how can he prove that he was
present when the photo was taken.

1004
02:10:57,563 --> 02:10:59,963
Once even I asked
a stupid question.

1005
02:11:00,232 --> 02:11:01,096
What was that?

1006
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:06,035
I asked that it is proved that
the basement stairs go down...

1007
02:11:06,472 --> 02:11:09,964
but how will you prove that
these very stairs come up too?

1008
02:11:11,777 --> 02:11:15,110
And what happened to the case?
- As usual, I lost it.

1009
02:11:25,391 --> 02:11:27,951
Shall I say something?
- Yes.

1010
02:11:29,295 --> 02:11:30,819
Forget it.

1011
02:11:33,265 --> 02:11:36,359
And then came the season of kites.

1012
02:11:36,602 --> 02:11:38,695
Listen, mother.
- Go on.

1013
02:11:38,904 --> 02:11:39,893
I managed to cut everybody's kites.

1014
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:57,081
Then she taught me Havai.
- Havai?

1015
02:12:12,671 --> 02:12:18,007
Their food is mind blowing.

1016
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:24,872
And one day I was fed so much food
that I couldn't control myself.

1017
02:12:25,084 --> 02:12:29,578
I went to the terrace, looked left,
looked right, and passed air.

1018
02:12:38,464 --> 02:12:42,730
And when I looked behind,
Nandini was laughing at me.

1019
02:12:43,168 --> 02:12:47,867
Do you know what she said?
'Sameer, a whiff of air! '

1020
02:13:03,255 --> 02:13:06,019
Then?
- Her stupid aunt spoilt everything.

1021
02:13:07,393 --> 02:13:11,887
I had asked her father beforehand
what his fees would be.

1022
02:13:12,164 --> 02:13:14,257
He'd said that his music
is not for sale...

1023
02:13:14,667 --> 02:13:16,396
he'll take it
when the time comes.

1024
02:13:16,969 --> 02:13:19,904
Do you know what he
asked for as fees?

1025
02:13:20,139 --> 02:13:21,265
What?

1026
02:13:31,250 --> 02:13:34,481
My life, Nandini.

1027
02:13:49,034 --> 02:13:52,938
Because when I was leaving home,
Nandini came on the terrace...

1028
02:13:52,938 --> 02:13:56,840
to see me the last time, and I
told her to become a statue.

1029
02:13:57,609 --> 02:14:01,705
She stood like a statue,
but her tears wouldn't stop flowing.

1030
02:14:13,425 --> 02:14:23,096
And my father says Nandini will
come, I will definitely get her.

1031
02:14:24,303 --> 02:14:25,736
I will get her, won't I, father?

1032
02:14:42,988 --> 02:14:44,285
Go and offer the flowers.

1033
02:14:46,625 --> 02:14:47,887
No, my father is here.

1034
02:15:29,268 --> 02:15:33,830
You are Nandini, aren't you?
See! I recognized you.

1035
02:15:34,239 --> 02:15:38,107
Sameer said you'll definitely
come, and you have!

1036
02:15:38,544 --> 02:15:44,176
He's always talking about you.
Only today he was telling me...

1037
02:15:44,483 --> 02:15:49,079
that he's going to have a show.
He's busy preparing for it.

1038
02:15:49,488 --> 02:15:51,479
He thinks of you all the time.

1039
02:15:54,860 --> 02:16:00,162
I'm sorry, I talk too much.
Who's he?

1040
02:16:05,471 --> 02:16:08,167
Where is Sameer?
- He just left.

1041
02:16:08,507 --> 02:16:11,135
You'll find him at
the bus stop. Go!

1042
02:16:12,444 --> 02:16:13,638
Where are you staying?

1043
02:16:15,380 --> 02:16:20,545
Listen, he sings at the Visconty
Bar in the city every Friday.

1044
02:20:58,163 --> 02:21:04,432
"The cool breeze..."

1045
02:21:05,270 --> 02:21:11,573
"must even now unsettling her hair"

1046
02:21:12,911 --> 02:21:15,812
"Your veil..."

1047
02:21:16,414 --> 02:21:26,813
"must even now be
slipping away from your head"

1048
02:21:27,225 --> 02:21:33,425
"Your hair must even now..."

1049
02:21:33,999 --> 02:21:41,531
"be adorned
by a flower"

1050
02:21:49,314 --> 02:21:56,049
"The cool breeze
of the nights..."

1051
02:21:56,388 --> 02:22:02,588
"must still be
giving you the chill"

1052
02:22:03,628 --> 02:22:16,940
"You must still be
drifting into dreams"

1053
02:22:18,310 --> 02:22:25,182
"The sun's rays,
in the morning..."

1054
02:22:25,550 --> 02:22:31,079
"must be driving
away your sleep"

1055
02:22:32,858 --> 02:22:39,161
"As I see it, my love..."

1056
02:22:40,131 --> 02:22:46,627
"you must even be
talking to yourself"

1057
02:22:47,439 --> 02:23:01,649
"That I look at you on the sly
is what you must think"

1058
02:23:02,053 --> 02:23:08,288
"The cool breeze..."

1059
02:23:09,294 --> 02:23:16,223
"must still be unsettling
your hair"

1060
02:25:36,841 --> 02:25:40,800
He's married, has a kid, and is
running after another woman.

1061
02:25:45,083 --> 02:25:51,044
Do you understand Hindi?
- You speak very fluent Hindi.

1062
02:25:52,457 --> 02:25:54,425
I speak very fluent Italian too.

1063
02:26:07,205 --> 02:26:10,299
Trust your love, and such
a situation will never arise.

1064
02:26:11,676 --> 02:26:14,873
How many people come here
because they fear God...

1065
02:26:15,380 --> 02:26:17,541
and how many come
because they love Him?

1066
02:26:18,016 --> 02:26:21,383
I come here because
I love Him very much...

1067
02:26:21,820 --> 02:26:23,378
and He's my father's friend

1068
02:26:25,023 --> 02:26:31,690
In my opinion, God is everywhere.
In fact, He's between us right now.

1069
02:26:32,297 --> 02:26:36,563
God is not between us,
He's within us.

1070
02:26:39,571 --> 02:26:43,007
If He's within us,
why does He hurt us?

1071
02:26:44,876 --> 02:26:49,506
Because we think of Him when in
pain and forget Him when we're happy.

1072
02:26:51,749 --> 02:26:56,448
He gives us sorrow,
so that we learn to love.

1073
02:26:57,789 --> 02:27:03,284
And if we love selflessly,
it takes us closer to Him.

1074
02:27:06,764 --> 02:27:08,459
Have you loved anyone like that?

1075
02:27:09,567 --> 02:27:12,297
I have.
- Me too.

1076
02:27:12,670 --> 02:27:14,638
But right now, she's in pain.

1077
02:27:19,744 --> 02:27:22,508
And I cannot bear
to see her in pain.

1078
02:27:29,521 --> 02:27:32,456
When so many people pray,
God gets very busy.

1079
02:27:33,925 --> 02:27:37,156
My father is a very good
friend of God, speak to him.

1080
02:27:39,330 --> 02:27:42,424
Father, he's my friend, you'll have
to give him whatever he asks for.

1081
02:28:02,453 --> 02:28:04,011
What do you do?

1082
02:28:04,923 --> 02:28:08,120
Nothing much, like I prayed for you
today, that's more than enough for me.

1083
02:28:09,627 --> 02:28:13,893
What brings you here?
- I've come looking for someone.

1084
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:21,969
You've found him! It's good we
met, I was feeling very Ionely.

1085
02:28:25,543 --> 02:28:30,448
Maybe you can help...

1086
02:28:30,448 --> 02:28:34,441
Do you like music?
- No.

1087
02:28:34,686 --> 02:28:37,177
I love music. Do you sing?

1088
02:28:37,589 --> 02:28:38,988
No.
- It's obvious.

1089
02:28:40,024 --> 02:28:44,893
Even I don't sing these days, but I
love a song which we'll sing together.

1090
02:28:45,196 --> 02:28:52,068
"The drum beat..."

1091
02:28:52,237 --> 02:28:56,333
"The drums beat loudly..."

1092
02:29:01,913 --> 02:29:06,612
Good, but it's not at all in tune.

1093
02:29:06,884 --> 02:29:12,957
"The drum beat..."

1094
02:29:12,957 --> 02:29:15,653
"The drums beat loudly..."

1095
02:29:15,994 --> 02:29:19,020
"And there's a furor..."

1096
02:29:19,497 --> 02:29:23,900
"The drum beat..."

1097
02:29:24,269 --> 02:29:27,238
"The drums beat loudly..."

1098
02:29:27,472 --> 02:29:40,715
"The drum beat..."

1099
02:32:53,444 --> 02:32:56,436
"The drums beat"

1100
02:32:56,814 --> 02:32:58,247
"The drum beat"

1101
02:32:58,516 --> 02:33:00,450
"The drum beat"

1102
02:33:01,319 --> 02:33:04,255
"The drums beat loudly"

1103
02:33:04,255 --> 02:33:06,985
"The drum beat"

1104
02:33:07,391 --> 02:33:10,724
"The drum beat"

1105
02:33:11,429 --> 02:33:14,762
"The drums beat loudly"

1106
02:33:14,932 --> 02:33:17,335
"She's so very precious..."

1107
02:33:17,335 --> 02:33:21,706
"she utters sweet-nothings;
she's doe-eyed"

1108
02:33:21,706 --> 02:33:24,869
"The drum beat"

1109
02:33:25,776 --> 02:33:28,370
"He's so very mischievous...
and talks so much"

1110
02:33:28,946 --> 02:33:31,540
"He says it all
to woo you..."

1111
02:33:42,827 --> 02:33:47,696
"the drum beat"

1112
02:33:47,899 --> 02:33:49,890
"The drum beat"

1113
02:33:50,134 --> 02:33:58,132
"The drums beat loudly"

1114
02:34:19,163 --> 02:34:22,894
"This beautiful body of yours...
let me feel it"

1115
02:34:23,134 --> 02:34:25,227
"No...
- Please do let me"

1116
02:34:33,010 --> 02:34:40,416
"Like the flowers,
a fragrance I exude"

1117
02:34:40,585 --> 02:34:47,423
"Do not touch me"

1118
02:34:47,792 --> 02:34:49,260
"Come to me, love...
- Let go of my hand"

1119
02:34:49,260 --> 02:34:50,921
"My way I will have.
- Don't be a devil!"

1120
02:35:02,239 --> 02:35:05,299
"The drum beat..."

1121
02:35:05,576 --> 02:35:07,812
"The drum beat..."

1122
02:35:07,812 --> 02:35:12,112
"The drums beat loudly"

1123
02:35:12,383 --> 02:35:15,409
"She's so very precious;
she talks so sweetly"

1124
02:35:15,886 --> 02:35:18,081
"The doe-eyed beauty..."

1125
02:35:18,556 --> 02:35:21,957
"The drums beat for her"

1126
02:35:22,093 --> 02:35:26,393
"He's so mischievous;
he talks so much"

1127
02:35:26,497 --> 02:35:28,897
"He teases me..."

1128
02:35:29,066 --> 02:35:32,593
"the drum beat"

1129
02:35:33,004 --> 02:35:39,143
"The drum beat"

1130
02:35:39,143 --> 02:35:46,283
"The drums beat loudly"

1131
02:35:46,283 --> 02:35:50,821
"The drum beat..."

1132
02:35:50,821 --> 02:35:53,187
"The drum beat..."

1133
02:35:54,425 --> 02:35:59,124
"The drums beat loudly"

1134
02:36:01,198 --> 02:36:04,998
"A furor it kicks up"

1135
02:36:05,136 --> 02:36:08,367
"A furor..."

1136
02:36:14,145 --> 02:36:20,351
"The drum beat"

1137
02:36:20,351 --> 02:36:26,256
"The drums beat loudly"

1138
02:36:54,752 --> 02:36:58,449
How did you know
I like these flowers?

1139
02:36:59,724 --> 02:37:02,215
They are not from me,
they are from him.

1140
02:37:03,928 --> 02:37:05,555
I met a very nice man
in the church today...

1141
02:37:05,963 --> 02:37:08,899
we even prayed for you together.

1142
02:37:08,899 --> 02:37:13,359
And look! When I came here, the
doctor said you can be discharged.

1143
02:37:14,205 --> 02:37:15,263
Get dressed.

1144
02:37:25,516 --> 02:37:26,540
Your clothes.

1145
02:37:31,756 --> 02:37:34,884
At the hotel...
What happened?

1146
02:37:35,326 --> 02:37:39,262
Where did you hear this song?
- He...

1147
02:38:12,730 --> 02:38:19,067
We'll go to Viscounty Bar tomorrow
Remember, Sameer's mother had said...

1148
02:38:19,470 --> 02:38:22,997
But how will we go there?
We don't have any money.

1149
02:38:24,575 --> 02:38:26,770
We'll definitely go,
even if it's without a ticket.

1150
02:38:34,318 --> 02:38:37,310
The ticket checker is here,
and we don't have tickets.

1151
02:38:41,692 --> 02:38:46,129
Remember that day in the train? The
TC couldn't ask for their tickets.

1152
02:38:47,364 --> 02:38:48,626
In the train?

1153
02:38:54,338 --> 02:39:00,675
Is he coming towards us?
- Yes.

1154
02:41:14,044 --> 02:41:16,205
Sameer may come,
we'll wait for him.

1155
02:41:27,391 --> 02:41:28,153
No.

1156
02:44:09,987 --> 02:44:11,750
Shall I tell you something?
- Yes.

1157
02:44:13,023 --> 02:44:14,217
Forget it.

1158
02:44:15,425 --> 02:44:21,625
You dance very well,
I really enjoyed myself today.

1159
02:44:23,634 --> 02:44:29,163
But even I dance well, don't I?
- Yes.

1160
02:44:29,239 --> 02:44:31,537
But shall I tell you something?

1161
02:44:32,109 --> 02:44:34,202
Yes.
- Forget it.

1162
02:44:40,150 --> 02:44:46,111
You know, I've met him.
He's a very nice man.

1163
02:44:47,758 --> 02:44:51,660
He'll always keep you happy,
maybe more than me.

1164
02:44:55,098 --> 02:45:01,560
Not maybe, he'll definitely
keep you more happy than me.

1165
02:45:02,706 --> 02:45:04,674
But shall I tell you something?

1166
02:45:06,677 --> 02:45:08,941
Yes.
- Forget it.

1167
02:45:10,147 --> 02:45:16,108
You know, when you go away,
I'll be a happy man.

1168
02:45:17,654 --> 02:45:23,615
I'll come to meet you.
I'd love meeting the two of you.

1169
02:45:30,167 --> 02:45:33,603
I'll call out to you
from that bridge.

1170
02:45:45,415 --> 02:45:49,010
You'll recognize
my voice, won't you?

1171
02:45:51,188 --> 02:46:01,154
You'll surely recognize my voice.
Come on, chose one hand.

1172
02:46:06,670 --> 02:46:10,106
I knew you'd get Sameer.

1173
02:46:11,441 --> 02:46:16,743
Even if you'd chosen this hand,
you'd get Sameer.

1174
02:46:20,350 --> 02:46:21,544
But shall I say something?

1175
02:46:32,829 --> 02:46:34,296
Forget it.

1176
02:47:37,227 --> 02:47:40,390
I don't know what
I said last night.

1177
02:47:48,372 --> 02:47:49,896
I don't even remember
what I was saying.

1178
02:47:51,808 --> 02:47:54,538
Maybe I spoke a bit too much.
- You said nothing.

1179
02:47:57,381 --> 02:48:00,976
Sometimes, a person says a lot
without really saying anything.

1180
02:48:06,022 --> 02:48:09,924
Whatever I said
last night was not...

1181
02:48:10,227 --> 02:48:19,135
Were you lying last night
or are you lying today?

1182
02:48:19,302 --> 02:48:22,032
Wishing for something and actually
getting it are two different things.

1183
02:48:25,442 --> 02:48:29,003
Love is not just getting...
Iove is to give.

1184
02:48:29,446 --> 02:48:30,708
Love!

1185
02:48:31,815 --> 02:48:39,517
I think I have now begun to
understand now what love is.

1186
02:48:52,402 --> 02:48:54,563
Yes.
- I'm Sameer's mother.

1187
02:48:55,372 --> 02:48:56,270
Where is Sameer?

1188
02:48:57,240 --> 02:49:00,698
He's doing a show at
Opera theater tonight.

1189
02:49:01,411 --> 02:49:05,177
Today is the biggest day of life.
He's coming to take me.

1190
02:49:05,382 --> 02:49:08,180
I haven't told him
about Nandini's arrival.

1191
02:49:08,618 --> 02:49:11,086
I'll tell him everything
when I meet him today.

1192
02:49:12,088 --> 02:49:16,650
My son will be so happy.
Listen, you bring Nandini there.

1193
02:49:17,260 --> 02:49:21,253
We'll unite them before the
show itself. Don't be late.

1194
02:49:23,834 --> 02:49:26,962
We'll be there.

1195
02:50:20,357 --> 02:50:27,097
"My heart I have given away
to you, my love"

1196
02:50:27,097 --> 02:50:31,591
"I now belong to you..."

1197
02:50:32,302 --> 02:50:36,238
"I swear it on you"

1198
02:50:37,541 --> 02:50:44,879
"I have given you
my heart, my love"

1199
02:50:45,282 --> 02:50:49,048
"I now belong to you..."

1200
02:50:49,786 --> 02:50:53,984
"I swear it on you"

1201
02:51:13,143 --> 02:51:19,149
"Atrocities I will bear"

1202
02:51:19,149 --> 02:51:23,518
"For you, I will
even lay down my life..."

1203
02:51:24,154 --> 02:51:27,453
"I swear it on you"

1204
02:51:28,491 --> 02:51:36,796
"I have given you my heart,
my love"

1205
02:51:36,967 --> 02:51:41,404
"I belong to you..."

1206
02:51:41,705 --> 02:51:45,801
"I swear it on you"

1207
02:51:46,076 --> 02:51:50,513
"I swear it on you"

1208
02:52:25,915 --> 02:52:33,686
"My hopes I have
pinned on you, my love"

1209
02:52:34,491 --> 02:52:42,057
"Your hand, I have held"

1210
02:52:43,166 --> 02:52:49,969
"Never will I forget you"

1211
02:52:52,175 --> 02:52:58,546
"Never will I forget you"

1212
02:53:00,550 --> 02:53:07,752
"My heart, I have given you,
my love"

1213
02:53:08,091 --> 02:53:12,152
"I really belong to you"

1214
02:53:12,595 --> 02:53:16,656
"I swear it on you"

1215
02:53:16,866 --> 02:53:21,496
"In your name, I swear"

1216
02:54:27,570 --> 02:54:35,534
"Thinking of you will
I spend my lifetime"

1217
02:54:36,012 --> 02:54:44,147
"After the Almighty, it is you
I will worship"

1218
02:54:44,454 --> 02:54:48,015
"Ask for anything..."

1219
02:54:48,291 --> 02:54:52,428
"it belongs to you"

1220
02:54:52,428 --> 02:55:01,461
"Seek anything...
it belongs to you"

1221
02:55:02,138 --> 02:55:08,543
"You I have given
my heart away to, my love"

1222
02:55:08,812 --> 02:55:17,743
"I do belong to you...
I swear"

1223
02:55:18,688 --> 02:55:25,821
"You, I have given my
heart away to, my love"

1224
02:55:26,196 --> 02:55:35,002
"I belong to you...
I swear it"

1225
02:55:35,438 --> 02:55:40,375
"In your name, I swear"

1226
02:55:40,844 --> 02:55:43,312
Will you...
- Nandini!

1227
02:55:43,379 --> 02:55:45,347
Sameer has been waiting for you.

1228
02:55:45,648 --> 02:55:47,206
Come on, hurry!

1229
02:56:33,696 --> 02:56:34,754
I knew you'd come!

1230
02:56:37,700 --> 02:56:41,337
And my father had said Nandini will
come to Italy, and you are here.

1231
02:56:41,337 --> 02:56:42,964
I'll come down the stairs.

1232
02:56:52,515 --> 02:56:56,884
I'd told you, hadn't I,
that you'll come to Italy?

1233
02:56:57,120 --> 02:57:01,557
You finally fought your stars
and wrote your own destiny.

1234
02:57:10,667 --> 02:57:11,998
And today's show...

1235
02:57:17,206 --> 02:57:23,736
After the show, we'll go
to a temple nearby...

1236
02:57:24,180 --> 02:57:28,776
and get married.

1237
02:57:41,764 --> 02:57:45,325
What happened?
Did I say anything wrong?

1238
02:57:47,770 --> 02:57:52,639
You are not happy to see me.
Look into my eyes, Nandini.

1239
02:57:58,147 --> 02:58:03,346
The love I used to see in
your eyes for me is no more.

1240
02:58:03,853 --> 02:58:09,155
You have changed.
- Yes, I have.

1241
02:58:09,892 --> 02:58:11,621
Circumstances have changed.

1242
02:58:12,996 --> 02:58:20,459
You loved me, and it was for love
that I came across the seven seas.

1243
02:58:21,671 --> 02:58:29,442
But I cannot cover this
small distance between us now.

1244
02:58:31,881 --> 02:58:37,319
You taught me to love,
but it was my husband...

1245
02:58:37,787 --> 02:58:42,224
who taught me to abide by it.

1246
02:58:44,260 --> 02:58:45,591
Husband?!

1247
02:58:47,330 --> 02:58:51,494
Sameer, I'm married.

1248
02:58:53,269 --> 02:58:57,569
By keeping your promise given to
my father, you fulfilled your duty.

1249
02:58:58,775 --> 02:59:04,313
But do you know, after marriage, when
my husband came to know about you...

1250
02:59:04,313 --> 02:59:10,843
without given a thought
to what people will say...

1251
02:59:11,754 --> 02:59:13,278
without giving a thought
to his own happiness...

1252
02:59:13,356 --> 02:59:17,588
he brought me here
to unite me with you...

1253
02:59:18,261 --> 02:59:24,222
to fulfill that vow of marriage,
that he'll give me all happiness.

1254
02:59:25,768 --> 02:59:31,070
It's then that I realized
that true love is sacrifice.

1255
02:59:33,843 --> 02:59:38,803
Now I have to fulfill my duty.
I must go back to him.

1256
02:59:41,184 --> 02:59:47,646
Please forgive me if you can.
Allow me to go to him, Sameer.

1257
02:59:51,661 --> 02:59:55,563
Go on, you have my permission.

1258
02:59:56,365 --> 02:59:59,425
But can I...,
though it's not necessary...

1259
03:00:00,436 --> 03:00:05,874
can I meet and see
who the lucky man is?

1260
03:00:10,646 --> 03:00:15,982
Oh yes, I've met him.
He's an interesting man.

1261
03:00:18,187 --> 03:00:21,224
I even taught him the
song, 'The drums beat..."

1262
03:00:21,224 --> 03:00:22,953
He cannot sing at all.

1263
03:00:24,861 --> 03:00:27,591
But he loves you very much.

1264
03:00:29,565 --> 03:00:35,504
We both prayed for you, I made
him talk directly to my father.

1265
03:00:36,739 --> 03:00:41,506
I told father to give him
whatever he asked for.

1266
03:00:43,179 --> 03:00:47,878
Father never grants me anything
otherwise, but this once, he did.

1267
03:00:49,185 --> 03:00:50,743
I'll deal with you later.

1268
03:00:51,988 --> 03:00:57,483
People say that she crossed
the seven seas for him.

1269
03:00:58,361 --> 03:01:05,028
But in today's jet age, board a
plane and you're there in seven hours!

1270
03:01:06,802 --> 03:01:12,035
But now, you'll have to
live with him for seven lives.

1271
03:01:14,510 --> 03:01:19,004
The few moments you spent with me,
are enough for seven lifetimes.

1272
03:01:21,918 --> 03:01:28,756
But not more than that, because in
your 8th life, you'll belong to me!

1273
03:01:35,097 --> 03:01:38,498
And don't look at me like that,
or you'll fall in love with me again.

1274
03:01:39,368 --> 03:01:42,667
Go! Because I look
horrible when I cry.

1275
03:02:01,824 --> 03:02:10,095
Now you listen to me! I've been
talking to you since childhood.

1276
03:02:10,666 --> 03:02:13,302
Everybody told me that
my father was dead...

1277
03:02:13,302 --> 03:02:16,237
but I kept you
alive in my heart.

1278
03:02:17,640 --> 03:02:20,040
I never asked anything from you,
except Nandini, but she has left.

1279
03:02:21,310 --> 03:02:25,713
She now belongs to Vanraj;
he's her husband.

1280
03:02:26,716 --> 03:02:31,346
But I ask you for something,
don't refuse me.

1281
03:02:32,855 --> 03:02:37,485
Just hug me once, please!

1282
03:02:40,263 --> 03:02:45,334
What happened, son?
- Nothing, I was talking to father.

1283
03:02:45,334 --> 03:02:51,170
I was telling Him, first He took
away my father, and now it's Nandini.

1284
03:02:51,707 --> 03:02:55,575
Now if He takes you away,
He should call me too.

1285
03:02:56,178 --> 03:03:00,740
I don't want to live in Italy,
I don't want to be a star.

1286
03:03:03,953 --> 03:03:07,013
"You have given me a body"

1287
03:03:07,490 --> 03:03:11,426
"Yet, why have you given me
a heart that breaks?"

1288
03:03:12,395 --> 03:03:16,899
"What is worse,
it falls in love..."

1289
03:03:16,899 --> 03:03:20,130
"Strange are Your ways, Lord"

1290
03:03:22,905 --> 03:03:28,707
"I meet her sometime,
and lose her"

1291
03:03:30,279 --> 03:03:32,815
"I unite with her
and lose her..."

1292
03:03:32,815 --> 03:03:37,752
"is this love?
Strange are your ways, Lord"

1293
03:03:38,688 --> 03:03:42,825
"Out of sufferance
my heart wept..."

1294
03:03:42,825 --> 03:03:45,259
"I have been punished
for loving"

1295
03:03:45,628 --> 03:03:47,459
"What sin have I committed?"

1296
03:03:47,697 --> 03:03:56,935
"Ruined I am
for having loved you"

1297
03:04:01,243 --> 03:04:04,735
Shall I say something?
- Yes.

1298
03:04:07,183 --> 03:04:08,411
Must you go away?

1299
03:04:11,587 --> 03:04:15,045
Shall I say something?
- Yes.

1300
03:04:18,361 --> 03:04:20,386
I can't live without you.
