1
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,790
Passport please.

2
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,750
Please you can get in. Next.

3
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,210
Hello, I'm coming to Hyderabad
with the goods.

4
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,380
Be ready.

5
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,790
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

6
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,520
The captain wants to see you now.

7
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,530
Alright let's go.
- Please come.

8
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,500
Put it here.

9
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,790
Your passport please.

10
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,380
Mr Pasupathi...
- Yes.

11
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,040
Those boxes belong to you.

12
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,100
Yes.
- What are they?

13
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,720
Toys.

14
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,650
Take this and open it.

15
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,580
Oh it's a gun.

16
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,750
And it working world wide.

17
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,430
Come on...

18
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,690
Greetings sir.

19
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,050
Good morning, sir.
- Greetings sir. Please come.

20
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,160
Why so many people are here?

21
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,910
Is there so demand for the gun?

22
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,720
No sir.
I'm just creating market for it sir.

23
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,600
So that they will fire shots
against each other.

24
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,700
Infact guns are more popular
with students than drugs.

25
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,100
Who is he?
- Greetings sir.

26
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,660
Ranjan Mudugalle from Sri Lanka.

27
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,760
.35 magnum from Colombia.

28
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,230
What's so special about it?

29
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,880
5 inch barrel, straight filling

30
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,460
single hand lock, 900 zoom.

31
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,720
You can carry it as easily
as a condom.

32
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,260
It's a common feature.

33
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,800
There's a specialty to this.

34
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,160
Hitting a moving
target is difficult.

35
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,920
But this gun will do it easily.

36
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,840
Didn't get me?

37
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,900
Move.

38
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,390
Do you see the child there?

39
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,480
Let's assume
she is the target.

40
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,640
Now, let's lock it.

41
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,680
Now its lock. See.

42
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,900
Look here.

43
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,760
It's like a video game.

44
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,040
It's not a game
and this is not a toy.

45
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,480
Don't you believe me?

46
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,910
What?

47
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,840
You don't believe this.

48
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,600
Very little noise, isn't it?

49
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,200
You can use it in a library too.

50
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,080
Don't reduce the price.
- Sir.

51
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,570
We had to pay a lot of bribes
to get it out of America.

52
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,920
Sir... that little girl.

53
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,480
Why are you upset for such
a trivial thing, Ramakoti?

54
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,240
Why was she present there?

55
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,120
Couldn't a puppy be there?

56
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,320
You call it as fate.
You can never avoid it.

57
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,680
Will she die if we fire a shot?

58
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,940
No she'll not.

59
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,200
I've been reading
'Bhagavat Gita' recently,

60
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,440
it's keeping me peaceful.

61
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,320
If I'm not wrong there's a line
for this situation...

62
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,840
Weapons will not kill the soul.

63
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,400
His sins will kill it.

64
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,690
Something like that.

65
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,400
It means we can't cut
the soul with a knife.

66
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
Drown it in water.

67
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,760
Fire a shot with revolver.

68
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,640
It means the girl is not dead.

69
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,400
It left the body, that's all!

70
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,240
Look there carefully.
The soul is still swinging.

71
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,280
Bye sir.

72
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,720
Clear the body.

73
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,400
Body will not be fresh like a soul.
It will stink.

74
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,680
I'll take care of it sir.

75
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,200
AFTER 10 MONTHS

76
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,090
I got the queen.

77
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,040
Where man?
- She's sitting there only.

78
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,080
So, the king will go to the queen.

79
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,520
King without army is useless.

80
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,800
So, let's all go together.

81
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,230
Come on boys!

82
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,960
This scarf is mine.

83
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,680
Please.
- Her cheeks are amazing!

84
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,440
I told my brother-in-law
that I'll go in a lorry,

85
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,560
he didn't listen and said,

86
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,980
train will have berths,
you can sleep and travel.

87
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,980
But people are not
allowing to sleep.

88
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,640
Rascal.

89
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,720
Brother, someone is
bashing up all our boys.

90
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,770
Our boys?
- Yes.

91
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,130
Manage 5 minutes, I'm coming.
- Okay.

92
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,420
Brother, the situation is
going out of our control.

93
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,370
Manage 2 minutes, I'm coming.
- Okay brother.

94
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,270
Are they your friends?
- No, I know them.

95
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,550
What about them now?

96
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,150
I'll carry them.
- Do it.

97
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,470
Did you warm up?
- Yes.

98
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,080
To beat me? - No.
I just did as I couldn't sleep.

99
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,830
Get them all admitted to the railway
hospital in the coming station.

100
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,090
Okay brother.
- Give the fan to TC.

101
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,170
Okay.
- It's government property.

102
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,180
Forget about this,
I'll take care of everything.

103
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,950
Good. You please sit down.

104
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,130
Who said here about coming?

105
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,310
It's me brother.

106
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,070
To beat me?
- No, to carry them.

107
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,390
Them? Do it.

108
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,870
Hey...
- I'm dead.

109
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,270
Respecting women is our tradition.

110
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,630
Do you feel it is
very old fashioned?

111
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,270
Good things are always old.

112
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,760
Never dare to change them,
just follow it sincerely.

113
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,570
Okay brother.
- Got it? Take him away.

114
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,780
Do you have water?

115
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,970
Take it.
- Thanks.

116
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,430
What are you studying?

117
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,580
Swati.

118
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,380
Not in the train, but in college.

119
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,060
Engineering final year.

120
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,510
Engineering?

121
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,230
I like girls who study well.

122
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,160
Just touch me on reaching
Secunderabad,

123
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,290
I'll get up immediately.

124
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,910
I've run out of words to thank you
for your timely help.

125
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,560
That's why I told you to wake me
up tomorrow morning. - Okay.

126
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,990
Girls shouldn't be so naive,
just kick up their butts.

127
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,400
Public will support you. Good night.

128
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,390
'Behave yourself.'

129
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,990
Move out man!

130
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,180
Don't you have a TV in your home?

131
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,260
I'll not spare anyone
without a platform

132
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,390
ticket without a fine of Rs. 1000.

133
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,270
Whatever it is, I've to buy
a silk sari for my wife.

134
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,380
Ticket please.

135
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,550
Ticket.

136
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,430
Ticket.

137
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,210
Thanks.

138
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,820
Sir ticket.

139
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,150
Ticket.
- You'll get it in counters.

140
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,090
Ticket please.
- How many times should I give?

141
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,350
To whom did you give?

142
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,630
Didn't I give it to you?

143
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,570
Police? Though I'm short,
I belong to a big family.

144
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,990
Please wait for a minute.
- Do it fast. No time.

145
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,850
Brother. Brother.

146
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,390
Couldn't you have come
alone to receive me?

147
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,640
Do you need so much of security?

148
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,950
They are not here for you,
they are my fans.

149
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,940
I gave my ticket to someone else
thinking him to be the TC.

150
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,730
What will you give now
to the TC?

151
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,480
If you give Rs. 1000,
I'll give it to him. - Me?

152
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,830
You helped me with Rs. 2 lakhs
to come up in life,

153
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,070
can't you spend Rs. 1000
to get out of this station?

154
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,950
Is it loan or help?

155
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,270
If I repay loan,
I'll get good name,

156
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,790
you'll get good name,
if you help me.

157
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,920
I'm content with the
fame I've got already.

158
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,230
I want you to earn
good name now.

159
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,110
I'll definitely but it'll take time.

160
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,470
Rs 1000?

161
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,790
Auto!

162
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,270
Why did you come down
here all of a sudden?

163
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,550
To meet a doctor.

164
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,640
Stop... stop... get in brother.

165
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,330
What's your problem brother?

166
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,470
Pain.

167
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,990
It starts here and goes side ways

168
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,150
and goes behind...
- Oh my God!

169
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,270
It comes again to the front and
then vanishes suddenly.

170
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,680
Very nice brother.

171
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,030
Pain?

172
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,090
No, your way of telling it.
- Excuse me.

173
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,580
Take it.

174
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,750
Took an appointment also?

175
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,140
Pain is unbearable.

176
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,430
I don't look like I'm in pain, do I?
- No, I do find you.

177
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,140
Doctor is calling you.

178
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,530
I'm talking to him, am I not?

179
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,700
Not you, me.

180
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,670
Okay, carry on.

181
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,030
There are many.

182
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,590
Today we must meet and leave.

183
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,040
Excuse me, can you get me
a glass of water?

184
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,390
You've legs and water is there,
can't you help yourself?

185
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,000
I've arthritis, I can't move.

186
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,250
Please.
- Okay.

187
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,380
Thank you.

188
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,950
Coming... coming.

189
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,380
Hi!

190
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,430
Who is he? Looks like a mad,
going away saying sorry too.

191
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,150
By any chance they are doing
any surgery on my brother.

192
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,610
Who is he?

193
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,110
I don't know his name.

194
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,250
Where will he be?

195
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,590
Don't know... on phone
he said Mehendi.

196
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,260
Are you here?

197
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,390
Why are your hands shivering?

198
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,790
Shall we go to the doctor?

199
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,830
Drinking water will give relief.

200
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,000
Drink.

201
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,220
Come.

202
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,590
What?
- Put your arms around me.

203
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,990
Did he prescribe any medicines?

204
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,230
He gave me a shot of injection.

205
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,750
Did you give him or
did he gave you?

206
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,630
Did you see?
- Forgot!

207
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,880
Good... come.

208
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,150
SHANTI NILAYAM

209
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,150
Stop here.

210
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,110
Get down.

211
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,550
Do you've change for Rs. 2000?
- No sir.

212
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,470
Wait here. Brother, these are group
of apartments,

213
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,350
this is Shanthi, next it Kanthi...
- Next is vomit...

214
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,630
Who wants to know this?

215
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,780
Fare sir.
- I'll pay man.

216
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,310
I'll wait, how can I go?

217
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,550
Vasu, come here.

218
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,750
He's my son, play with
him till I come back.

219
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,510
Bye son.

220
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,510
Brother...

221
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,510
Hail Lord Anjaneya!

222
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,280
Very funny.

223
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,720
They are calling you.
- Don't look!

224
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,970
Why?

225
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,370
The girls sitting on the left,
don't look at them.

226
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,930
Why are you showing other side
when they are this side?

227
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,340
If I point at them
they will cut my hand.

228
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,870
They are not girls,
but atom bombs.

229
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,050
The further you are from them
the better... - Me?

230
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,720
Not you... not you... the further
you are from them the better.

231
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,910
They are capable
of stealing chastity

232
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,230
which is more valuable than life.

233
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,190
Deadly rowdies.

234
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,160
So, I watch the painting
there to reach home.

235
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,300
There's no painting there.

236
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,050
Just imagine an MF Husain painting
is there and walk home.

237
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,640
Come, don't stop.

238
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,960
Girl, come here.
- Me?

239
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,130
Come here.
- Go and see.

240
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,400
What?

241
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
Aren't you Rama Rao's daughter?

242
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,120
No, I'm Mohan Rao's daughter.

243
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,350
Uncle Mohan's daughter!

244
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,800
Don't you remember,
we played together as kids?

245
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,880
No.

246
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,720
How grown up you have become?

247
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,060
Go and play.
- Come.

248
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,000
Wait, tell your father
about my enquiry. - Okay.

249
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,610
Is her father so close to you?
- I don't know.

250
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,040
Sir, betel?
- No please.

251
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,160
Two.
- Okay.

252
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,880
You say you don't know him,
but you moved so close with her.

253
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,310
I liked her face so I called her...

254
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,350
Oh My God!
- Take it.

255
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,480
No need to discuss about it, come.

256
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,880
He seems to be more
dangerous than those girls.

257
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,380
Money sir.
- Put it on someone's account.

258
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,640
What sir?
- Come... Come...

259
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,980
Okay, okay.

260
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,120
No lift also.
- Just few steps only.

261
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,880
Isn't the betel leaf very good?

262
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,320
Venu. Venu, it seems you didn't
pay the auto fare?

263
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,770
He's threatening to take my son.

264
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,680
I wouldn't mind if it
had been my wife.

265
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,780
Come quickly.

266
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,790
Don't take extra money.

267
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,800
Just Rs. 100, wait I'll be
back in a minute.

268
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,280
It's sheer madness to become a
secretary of apartments' association.

269
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,800
Complaints about no light,
no tap water,

270
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,040
how can it come,
unless you pour it yourself?

271
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,320
Not water but money.

272
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,600
Money will get you water.

273
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,100
Send money with someone.

274
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,360
Hasn't the tailor come yet?

275
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,950
He is on the way.

276
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,380
He is here.

277
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,530
Come in.

278
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,400
I'm calling you... come in.

279
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,680
Should I give formal invitation?

280
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,200
Come in.

281
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,110
Money!

282
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,120
Asking me how much
as if you don't know?

283
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,440
Is it first time? Rs. 2000!

284
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,090
Give... give...
are you giving for charity?

285
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,720
Come in.

286
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,240
How long should I stand like this?

287
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,130
Do your work? Come on.

288
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,160
Dear, your breakfast is ready.

289
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,320
What?

290
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,070
My mother.

291
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,800
Where?

292
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,240
No problem.

293
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,000
Do it fast,
I've lot of work outside.

294
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,070
Come on!

295
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,220
Mother!
- What? What happened?

296
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,770
Who are you?

297
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,770
How dare to hug my daughter?

298
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,810
How did you enter my home?

299
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,400
I'm asking you and
why are you going away?

300
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,840
Who is he?
- I don't know.

301
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,280
Who are you?

302
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,570
Why don't you say?

303
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,800
This girl opened the door
and invited me inside.

304
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,720
He rang the calling bell.
- Shut up!

305
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,060
I walked in and you charged
me a hefty Rs. 2000.

306
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,890
Rs. 2000? - Yes,
a stocky man took it here only.

307
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,050
Who is he?
- Look this man only.

308
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,340
Daddy!
- Dad...

309
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,010
What a family!

310
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,280
What exactly happened now?

311
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,480
Money...
did you take money from him?

312
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,360
Yes, I took from him. Is it wrong?
202 resident sent maintenance fee.

313
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,400
What happened now?

314
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,100
Nothing happened, return my money.

315
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,160
I'll return but what happened
really here?

316
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,600
Will you take money
from any stranger also?

317
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,420
I said I'll return his money,
tell me what happened?

318
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,480
What happened?

319
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,830
I've asked the same
question many times.

320
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,440
Nobody answered that,
will they answer you immediately?

321
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,480
What happened brother?

322
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,960
Nothing, this girl opened the door
and took me into the room,

323
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,200
inside bed room...
hands up once...

324
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,560
she did like this and
I hugged her tightly like this.

325
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,200
He hugged her like this only.
- Did he hug her like this?

326
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,280
Mad girl, come here.

327
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,880
I said this lady is in the hall,

328
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,390
she said she's my mother,
no problem.

329
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,080
I thought it's regular to them.

330
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,220
What are you saying man?

331
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,520
I thought it's your family business.

332
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
This isn't our family business,
our family business is rice selling.

333
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,660
Brother, I didn't get you,
come again from the start.

334
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,920
Hands up once.

335
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,250
The girl put her hands up like this.

336
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,220
And I...

337
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,840
Now you go ahead.
- Will I do it for all? No way.

338
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,420
Why are you still talking to him?
Call police and get him arrested.

339
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,800
Police? Who do you think he is?

340
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,010
My brother, he's a big landlord
back in my native village.

341
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,160
100 acres?!

342
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,260
80 acres of farm and
20 acres of coconut farm.

343
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,480
Lone owner.

344
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,120
Come to dinner tonight.

345
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,930
Dear, you too invite him.

346
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,860
SI, I invite you to dinner
in my home.

347
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,680
I invited him.

348
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,060
Aunt.
- What?

349
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,200
Mummy.
- No, go to him.

350
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,080
Hubby. - I'm very sorry for all
that happened just now.

351
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,160
Don't mind about her yelling,
she didn't know you were a landlord.

352
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,350
I'll not mind.

353
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,990
Bye... bye.
- Dear.

354
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,250
May I send you tea?
- Why unnecessary work?

355
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,050
What a good man!
- Send a coffee.

356
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,530
Enough.

357
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,380
Is coffee good?

358
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,310
Can I ask you a thing
if you don't mind?

359
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,850
Go ahead.
- Did she really invite you inside?

360
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:03,380
Bloody... you'll lose sight if you
suspect a good man like me.

361
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,470
A girl who didn't even
look at me in a year,

362
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,060
how did she invite you to hug her?

363
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,630
That's it, girls are very
difficult to understand.

364
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,920
How could she invite a novice
like you leaving a senior like me?

365
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,180
No... no... the shoe is good
on your leg... be it there.

366
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,570
Will wear out! - I'll not give
you that opportunity.

367
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,230
I've a little doubt.

368
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,570
Go ahead.
- Not about that girl,

369
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,550
did you ever had it with a girl?

370
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,780
What for all these arrangements?

371
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,270
Lord Ganesha's birthday is coming,
isn't it?

372
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,390
Do you celebrate lavishly?

373
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,910
We celebrate it...
hey, you are changing the topic.

374
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,470
Did you had it or not?
Please tell me.

375
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,850
No.
- I'll not tell anyone.

376
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,630
Promise.
- Not that...

377
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,990
Sometimes I do have a peg or two...

378
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,160
...but never had it with women...

379
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,270
Brother!

380
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,220
You get lost.

381
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,460
How they are falling?

382
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,660
Do you know why I worked
for you all these days?

383
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,910
For your money.

384
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,950
Hey Oldies, tell me!
Where are the keys?

385
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,160
Otherwise I'll kill you.

386
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,450
Oh my God!
- Thanks, dear.

387
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,470
Lawyer, we got married 24 hrs. back.

388
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,530
she's not allowing me to touch also,

389
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,190
I'll divorce her.

390
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,180
Shall we apply for a divorce?
- Wrong number.

391
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,230
Nothing happened.
- Take her away girls.

392
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,870
How did you fall?

393
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,750
Brother... brother...

394
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,270
Brother!

395
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,230
What happened?

396
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,310
I've slipped.
- Lord Ganesha should save you.

397
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:10,160
Hail Lord Ganesha!

398
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,590
Hail Lord Ganesha!

399
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,390
This is Mehendi area, brother.

400
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,710
The area looks spooky.

401
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,040
Why brother?

402
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,070
Oh My sweet darling.
- What's this?

403
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,110
Doesn't it look like
a one way to heaven?

404
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,550
Looks like a highway to AIDS, come.

405
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:01,060
"Hit a six,
play the game like a game..."

406
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,670
Rasool.
- What is it sister?

407
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,130
Get me a bottle of shampoo.

408
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,370
Give me Rs. 100.
- It's only Rs. 75.

409
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,960
Rs. 25 is my commission.

410
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,180
Taking a cut from
your sister like me?

411
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,110
You are right.

412
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,680
No need of commission,
give me Rs. 25 for my expenses.

413
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,380
Okay, take it.

414
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,250
"Hit a six,
play the game like a game..."

415
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,470
Brother...

416
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,310
What is your name?

417
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,650
Rasool... why?

418
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,550
We need little information.

419
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,070
If you tell you'll get money to buy
Champagne instead of shampoo.

420
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,440
What's the matter?

421
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,810
Sit here.

422
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,470
I want a gun.

423
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,590
Gun?

424
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,550
Girls, I can but guns, no way.

425
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,350
Thank God! He doesn't know,
let's go away.

426
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,620
Okay

427
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,630
Will you go away
if I say I don't know?

428
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,760
Then what?

429
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,510
Give me little time to think.

430
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,310
Need more time?
- Little more.

431
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,790
Your name should
have been collector.

432
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,170
Enough?

433
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,830
How can you get a gun immediately?

434
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,230
Do you really want a gun?

435
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,910
I want the seller.

436
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,490
Azghar!

437
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,110
Go straight little further
and take left turn,

438
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,430
third house in the street.

439
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,450
He's more dangerous than
the guns he sells. Be careful.

440
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,590
Hit a six! You are looking
very charming, what's the matter?

441
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,580
Get lost boy.

442
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,350
Are you interested?

443
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,110
Take care of her.

444
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,830
What? What's the matter?

445
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:41,210
Are you coming?
- No... No...

446
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,720
Come... come I say...Free

447
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,260
Stay here.

448
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,270
Are the goods dispatched?
- No

449
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,960
What?

450
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,110
I want Azghar.
- Why?

451
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,510
I want Azghar.

452
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,390
Why?
- Azghar... got me?

453
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,310
You know the address, don't you?
Come, let's go now.

454
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,870
That's why I told you to stay here.

455
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,700
Brother is calling you.

456
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,990
Tell me. What do you want?

457
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,870
I want a gun.

458
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,430
Who told you I sell guns?

459
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,310
Guns are not for sale here.
Go away.

460
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,870
Leave him.

461
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,990
That's it! I want one like that.

462
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,760
Got you... You are not a policeman.

463
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,530
You are a wounded tiger,
you need this.

464
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,340
Okay... take it...

465
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,550
But it'll cost you.

466
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,030
Price?

467
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,630
Rs. 25000.

468
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,760
Not to me, but the price you get.

469
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,790
Who supplies you?

470
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,280
Why so little cash?

471
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,160
How many guns did you sell?
- 25.

472
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,850
That's all?
- Unseason.

473
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,680
May I suggest an idea?
- Tell me.

474
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,600
Let's run a scheme.
- What is it?

475
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,040
A country made pistol free
with every portable TV.

476
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,080
Revolver free with every
purchase of projection TV.

477
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,800
Let's give a free AK 47
with every plasma TV,

478
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,440
Customer will fire trial shots
on you and me.

479
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,400
Not good sir?
- Stinking.

480
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,080
Azghar said it was excellent.

481
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Why not? He's a useless man.

482
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,200
Only brawn and no brain.

483
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,560
Just now we were talking about you.

484
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,400
Long life of 100 years,
what brings you here?

485
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,360
A man came for gun and
started to fight with me.

486
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,870
Who is he? Police?

487
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:36,320
I don't know sir, I slipped out
from there as he bashed up our boys.

488
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,120
Couldn't you've given
your address too?

489
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,960
Why are you looking at me?

490
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,960
He'll come to your place everyday
like entering a film theatre,

491
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,440
if he bashes you up
continuously for a day,

492
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,000
you'll give this man's
bio-data also to him.

493
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,120
It'll be screen down for Ramakoti.

494
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,200
Why are you here again?

495
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,520
I kept the soldering rod here.

496
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,800
It's with him, take it.

497
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,160
Who are you putting that chair for?

498
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,500
To rest your legs.

499
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,880
You still respect me a lot.
- Yes brother.

500
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,350
What is that?
- Liquor.

501
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,360
A small?

502
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,280
No... make it large.

503
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,600
Okay. When I went to buy this
bottle, young lads of 18 years,

504
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,520
nation is getting ruined.

505
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,730
By the way, ladies too.

506
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,640
Soda or water?

507
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,880
Otherwise no kick.

508
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:38,880
Whatever said and done,
drinking is really bad habit.

509
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,840
Never encourage it.

510
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,200
Right brother.

511
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,050
Even in our village people are

512
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,640
drinking country
liquor day and night.

513
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,400
Isn't there anyway to reform them?

514
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,000
They will not reform so easily.

515
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,960
Make another large for me.

516
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,600
Make a law to kill drunkards,
that's the only remedy.

517
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,400
What shall we eat for dinner?

518
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,610
Dinner makes me remember,

519
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,670
we have been invited
for dinner by neighbours,

520
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,200
we are boozing
forgetting about that.

521
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,560
So what? Are we drunkards
to trip and fall? - Right.

522
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,520
Let's have four pegs and
eat two mouthful in their home,

523
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,480
Come back after saying
good night to them.

524
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,360
They will not find it, will they?

525
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,960
Shut up, silly boy.

526
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,200
If I drink even my mother
can't find it.

527
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,400
How did you manage it?

528
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,160
I never went home that night.

529
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,850
Good morning

530
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,120
Excuse me.
- What?

531
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,760
Is this your flat?

532
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,120
You came earlier once.

533
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,900
I saw from behind,
seeing the front for the first time.

534
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,180
Nonsense.

535
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,760
It's you.
- Go.

536
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,800
Why are you walking like that?

537
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,240
We must be very careful
in situations like this.

538
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,640
Come in.

539
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,760
Greetings.
- Greetings.

540
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,200
We are waiting for you only.

541
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,640
Why is your face swollen? Cold?

542
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,080
Sit down.

543
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,120
She puts questions and
answers them herself, a Goddess!

544
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,180
Isn't aunt's night
dress little flashy?

545
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,440
It's a fashion.

546
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,020
This colour is very good.
- My daughter selected it.

547
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,480
Have you come?
- Greetings.

548
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,920
To you.
- To you.

549
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,560
Greetings... please take your seat.

550
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,600
Careful.

551
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,000
I found design very good,
so I fell down to see it.

552
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,050
My daughter made them.

553
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,520
Did you see today's newspaper?

554
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,640
A murder was committed in Nampalli.

555
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,600
Did your daughter committed it?

556
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,230
She got a prize for her drawing.

557
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,960
I almost died seeing your daughter.

558
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,440
Greetings.

559
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,860
What happened?

560
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,680
Brother, you saw everything but
missed to see the flooring.

561
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,840
My daughter only...

562
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,240
She cleaned it, didn't she?

563
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,530
Get up now dear.
- I've been trying.

564
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:54,400
This shows Parameshwara Rao's
daughter is...

565
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,440
Very arrogant?

566
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,600
Likes cleanliness.

567
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,120
Please serve food.

568
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,400
I've already served.

569
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,400
He's asking for another helping.
- Okay.

570
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,520
Don't eat like a gargantuan,
eat little by little. - Okay.

571
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,680
What did your daughter do aunt?

572
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,000
She did her BA.

573
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,280
We stopped her after finding she
was roaming like boys.

574
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,200
Good thing you did, your
daughter is really like a knife.

575
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:32,360
I mean knife is very sharp,
she's so intelligent I meant.

576
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,640
You said it right.

577
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,160
When she was studying Inter,

578
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:39,280
a boy next door too said
she was like a knife.

579
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,250
What might have been his intention?

580
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,080
Shall I serve curd?
- I'll lose it.

581
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,430
Lose it?

582
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,920
I mean it will lose the taste.

583
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,160
We never invite every Tom,
Dick and Harry to dinner?

584
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,320
Not every one will be
rich like you, right?

585
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,080
You are a good man so...

586
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,320
City boys are terrible now a days.
Cigarettes after tenth class.

587
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,600
If they fail, they take to bottle.

588
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,170
Just a while ago
we were also discussing

589
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,640
the same thing, right buddy?

590
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,120
You have come drunk, right?

591
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,960
We managed everything
perfectly, right?

592
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,520
How did you find it?

593
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,560
If you eat with right hand and
wash left hand, can't I find it?

594
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,620
He's no ordinary man.

595
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,660
He patted my back on arrival
and hugged you.

596
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,940
We mustn't spare him,
we must show him our power.

597
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,370
Hail Lord Anjaneya!

598
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,790
Me?

599
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,060
Don't know what's in store for me?

600
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,880
Come...
- Come sir.

601
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,980
What is it sister?
- Why are you wearing new shirt?

602
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,620
Today is my birthday sister.

603
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,500
Really?
- I swear on my mother.

604
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,540
Happy birthday to you brother Venu.
- Thank you sisters.

605
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,500
Come to 10 Downing Street
today evening.

606
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,140
Why sister?
- We'll celebrate your birthday.

607
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,660
You'll celebrate...
what will I do then?

608
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,020
Foot the bill.
- I don't have money sister.

609
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,900
Take loan or steal,
arrange a party today evening.

610
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,380
Bring him also with you,
or else he'll cry on us.

611
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,980
Okay sister.
- Okay.

612
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,780
See how I'll play with
him in the pub.

613
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,280
He must go back with
his tail between the legs.

614
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,460
Yes!

615
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,280
Nobody can stop us, come.
- Stop.

616
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,580
I'm throwing a party inside.

617
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,860
I'll send the bill outside.

618
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,100
You please get in.

619
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,670
Please come this side.

620
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,660
Why did he stop only us?

621
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,740
This get up doesn't match
with this set up.

622
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,100
What shall we do then?

623
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,220
Give me 10 minutes and Rs. 10000
leave rest on me.

624
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,800
What?

625
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,210
This way.

626
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,290
Go in.

627
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,760
Hey take this.
- Thank you sir.

628
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,280
Brother.

629
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,990
Wow!
- Hey!

630
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,070
You look like a 'hero'.
- Really.

631
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,610
That's right.
- Fantastic.

632
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,370
Okay. Let's go.
- Thanks.

633
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,540
That's it.
- Good?

634
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,220
Any one will give a
present or treat for birthday?

635
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,380
But a friend of mine here is going
to dance and entertain you.

636
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,480
Here is Mr Sathyanarayanamurthy
from Amalapuram.

637
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,340
That's my native place.

638
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,140
Go... go...
- Me?

639
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,550
Go... go... Come on. Come on. Yes.

640
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,180
Not that way. This way brother.
- You're right.

641
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,380
We must be very careful
in every step we put.

642
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:48,820
You said that.

643
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,540
Why did you hit me?
- Get up.

644
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,160
How many time will you hit me?

645
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:59,540
Fit for nothing. Can't
you collect Rs. 10 from morning?

646
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,780
I won't get a peg of liquor
with your Rs. 3.

647
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,970
Stop beating her.

648
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,070
Why are you beating a small girl?

649
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:09,150
Will you keep quiet if I beat you?
That's why I'm beating her.

650
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:12,400
Keep quiet. Don't beat her.

651
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,500
Get lost.

652
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,670
Don't cry.

653
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,140
I asked you to beg, but you're
hiring goons to beat me.

654
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,370
I'll kill you.

655
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:23,440
What happened?

656
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,660
He is beating a small girl.

657
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:29,260
I'll crush you, you...
- No.

658
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,990
How dare he beats a small girl?
I'll kill you.

659
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,990
Don't cry.
He won't beat you anymore.

660
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,390
Come and sit here.

661
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:42,520
Oh my dear! What's your name?

662
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,510
Saraswathi.

663
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,190
Saraswathi...?
- Which class are you studying?

664
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,420
I don't study.

665
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Really...? It's alright if
others don't study.

666
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,060
But Saraswathi must study.

667
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,990
From tomorrow, don't go to work
and start studying.

668
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:59,670
Because you are innocent
children and not workers.

669
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:06,430
Study well and become a great
leader of this country.

670
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,040
Never compromise in that matter.

671
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,300
Take this.

672
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,860
Take this money.

673
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,420
Eat bread, drink milk and sleep.

674
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:24,700
And with this, eat 'idli' and
drink milk tomorrow morning.

675
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,780
What will you do day after tomorrow?

676
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:31,410
Take all the money.

677
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,970
Eat well and study well.
Don't work.

678
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:43,310
Put the money in this wallet.
Or else he'll take it from you.

679
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:44,500
Careful

680
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,980
My cute little doll.

681
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,420
If he tries to beat you,

682
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,090
hit him on his head
with this stick.

683
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,740
He'll die.

684
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,700
Come on. Come.

685
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:01,470
Go and have no fear.

686
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:07,780
If anyone beats small children,
I'll lose my temper.

687
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:14,420
Can anyone fire a shot
at a 6 year old child?

688
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:19,570
But they shot her dead.

689
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:24,170
If I get them, I'll kill them all.

690
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:27,860
I'll chop them into pieces.
- Brother...

691
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:30,880
I'll kill them.

692
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,850
I'll burn their bodies.

693
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,860
Otherwise...
- Careful.

694
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,650
How dare they kill my little angel?

695
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,230
I'll kill them.

696
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:46,180
I won't spare them. I'll kill them.

697
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:49,180
How dare they kill my little angel?

698
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,050
I'll kill them.

699
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,700
I'll kill them.

700
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,410
Venu, who is that little angel?
Who does he want to kill?

701
00:47:58,490 --> 00:47:59,660
What happened to him?

702
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,960
Any love failure?

703
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:01,960
Some thing like that.

704
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,720
What's her name?
- Lavanya.

705
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,640
Is she beautiful?
- Very beautiful.

706
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,680
Her qualification?
- 2nd class.

707
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,720
2nd class...?

708
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,390
I'll kill them.

709
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,800
My little angel.

710
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,280
Uncle, fast.

711
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,890
Please.

712
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,080
Here they come.

713
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:36,300
Ramaiya, visit home once.

714
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,480
Get down.
Go and play there

715
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,240
Daddy...
- I'm coming.

716
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,910
Why have your mom and
my mom come here?

717
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,960
What did you do?

718
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,400
She bunked the school and
playing in the fields.

719
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,360
Did she bunk the school?

720
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,600
Don't talk rubbish.

721
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,000
Today would have been a holiday.

722
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,640
Yes uncle. Today is a holiday.
I swear.

723
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,920
Why is it a holiday today?
- School keys might be lost.

724
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,240
No uncle. My teacher died.
- Oh my God!

725
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,080
I saw him yesterday.
He was fit and fine

726
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,560
Even today I'm fit and fine.

727
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,800
So, you are still not dead.
- Yes.

728
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,120
But I'll die if you want to.

729
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,040
Then, it must have been
in your dreams.

730
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,400
Look at her.

731
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,400
When asked to go to school,
she says you are dead.

732
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,600
Why did you come here?

733
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,840
To give you a piece of advice.
- What happened?

734
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,840
Saying that your mother died, she
left the school in the afternoon.

735
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,660
Madam, are you alright?

736
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,280
So, you killed my mother too?

737
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,840
She is crying. Don't cry.

738
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,000
You're just like your uncle.

739
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:47,200
Brother, stop supporting her.

740
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,540
We pamper her too much.

741
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,920
If she stays here,
she'll become like her uncle.

742
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,800
Two daggers in one, and
two tigers in one cage can exist.

743
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:00,000
But they both shouldn't
stay together.

744
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,650
Have this

745
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,210
For me?

746
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,320
What's next?
- Lentils and rice.

747
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,190
Sathyam, have you ever seen our
neighbour's grand daughter?

748
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:23,400
What happened?

749
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,110
She speaks English so well.

750
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,240
She doesn't know to speak in Telugu.

751
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,600
They shouldn't worry.

752
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:35,080
Beat her and she will say
"Amma" in Telugu.

753
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,200
Shit!

754
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:42,490
Brother,
your brother-in-law's friend

755
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,580
knows a good school in Hyderabad.

756
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,760
Are you going to study at this age?
What are you going to do?

757
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,160
It is for Lavanya and not for me.

758
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,720
It's a very good school.
And medium instruction is English.

759
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,290
Getting a seat is very tough.

760
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:54,800
Is the school so small?

761
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,720
Actually, it is a very big school.

762
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,970
There is a play ground, library
and a swimming pool too.

763
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,840
But my uncle won't be there.

764
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,200
Say something.

765
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,210
I'm not interested.
- What are you talking?

766
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:16,480
If she stay here,
she will become foolish.

767
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,110
If she goes there, she will become
a donkey carrying bags of books.

768
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,770
If she can't speak English,
how can she survive?

769
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:26,320
When I'm here, why should she
struggle to survive?

770
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,620
She will study here.

771
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,120
After that,
will she make cow dung balls?

772
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,120
I'll arrange for tutors.

773
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,190
How will you perform her marriage?

774
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,200
I'll offer my 100 acres as dowry.
- Actually...

775
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,040
If anyone talks about this again...

776
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,320
I'll rip off their skin.

777
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:39,480
I'll beat you.
- My dear angel.

778
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,430
Very stubborn! Just like his father.

779
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:43,800
Never allows anyone
to say anything.

780
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,900
Why are you scolding my uncle?

781
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,000
Can't I scold my son?

782
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:49,330
Shut up!

783
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:52,330
Wow! My sweet angel.
- Lavanya!

784
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,490
When she is so good at English,
why admit her in a convent school?

785
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:59,160
But that convent school is...
- You say it is very good.

786
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,480
Then we will do one thing.

787
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,160
Since you are very much interested,

788
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,240
and brother-in-law knows
the school very well,

789
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:08,000
make arrangements to
build the school here.

790
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,180
I'll bear the expenses.

791
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,560
Let's go.

792
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:24,480
Uncle...

793
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,200
What is it?

794
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,920
Shall we go to Hyderabad and
get admitted in the school?

795
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,640
Why did you get this idea?

796
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,040
Because my mom is crying.

797
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,180
If you go away, I'll cry.

798
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,570
I won't stay there permanently.
I'll stay there for a week.

799
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:44,670
I'll see Charminar, Tank bund,
Buddha's statue and other places.

800
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,730
Then, I'll bite some teacher's hand.

801
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:51,580
They will get fed up with me
and throw me out.

802
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,300
It is wrong.
You shouldn't do like that.

803
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,520
Go to Zoo park too and then bite.

804
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,400
Excuse me.

805
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,400
How many are going to join?

806
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:14,360
Myself.

807
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,080
So many people to admit one girl!

808
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,680
Is everyone an orphan like her?

809
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,800
Why quarrel with her?

810
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,400
This school is so good,

811
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,800
that the students have
become engineers, doctors.

812
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,760
Those who didn't study properly...
- Became teachers like her.

813
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,810
Lavanya.

814
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,980
What's your name?
- Lavanya.

815
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,250
She is very good in English.

816
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:36,440
She spoke in English
and not our Lavanya.

817
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,650
Which class are you studying?
- 2nd class.

818
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,200
How much 6 X 6 =?

819
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,120
Tell me what is 6 X 6 =?

820
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:45,490
20...

821
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,170
Good. Put her in L.K.G.

822
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,240
Next.

823
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,630
She was damn good in the interview.
- Damn good...?

824
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,160
She said 6 x 6 = 20.

825
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,920
From 2nd class,
she is now going to L.K.G.

826
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,370
Yes.
- Did they admit her in school?

827
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,280
They gave us a sofa instead.

828
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,520
They dumped a 2nd
class girl to L.K.G.

829
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,500
I knew it.

830
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,320
Bite her neck instead of
biting someone else.

831
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,920
Shall we admit her in the hostel?

832
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,840
Why so hurry?
Won't you let us to see the city?

833
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,960
Lavanya, careful.

834
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,990
Faster uncle.
- Okay.

835
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,400
Dear!
- Lavanya!

836
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,120
Lavanya! Dear...

837
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:53,380
Dear!

838
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,340
She is bleeding.

839
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,120
Come on fast.

840
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,840
Please wait.

841
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,080
The child died long back.

842
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,480
Looks like she got hit by a stone.

843
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,810
She was hit by a bullet.

844
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:21,930
Doctor please.

845
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,680
What is it?

846
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,560
Money.
- For what?

847
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,400
It was me who took her to the swing.

848
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,080
Or else this wouldn't have happened.

849
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,400
It is a grave mistake.

850
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,360
Why are you so worried?
She will be alright.

851
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,440
She will come out in
an hour with a smile.

852
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,570
My men shot her.

853
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,400
While trying to fire at a dog,
she came in between.

854
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,240
Who gave you the permission?

855
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,640
This is 5 lakhs.

856
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,200
I'll give this to you if you want.
Or else, I'll kill you,

857
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,680
and give this to this area's CI.

858
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,240
It's police case. I can't help you.

859
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:08,320
You can help us.

860
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,920
Tell them she must be operated.

861
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,480
Wait for an hour and tell them
she died on the operation table.

862
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,080
Doctor, how is she?
Is she alright?

863
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,960
Since it is a head injury...
brain hemorrhage...

864
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,120
I mean blood clot.

865
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:26,760
We must perform
a surgery immediately.

866
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,940
Operation!

867
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,080
Please go ahead.
Don't worry about the expenses.

868
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,800
We'll sell all our
properties. Please.

869
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,840
I beg you.
- Okay.

870
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,200
I'll send you the papers.
Sign them.

871
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,240
Please sign.

872
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:42,960
What is this?

873
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,810
If something goes
wrong during surgery,

874
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,550
they don't want to
be responsible for it.

875
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:47,530
What is it?

876
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,520
She'll fine.
These are mere formalities.

877
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,600
Please sign.

878
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,380
Hello.

879
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:00,360
It's over. I'm coming.

880
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,640
Brother, doctor has come.

881
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,080
Doctor, can we see her?

882
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:10,350
I'm sorry.

883
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:12,590
She is dead.

884
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,770
Lavanya!

885
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,630
Lavanya!

886
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:27,380
As days passed everyone forgot
about Lavanya's sad demise.

887
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:28,940
Except my brother.

888
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,320
Call him for lunch... go.

889
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,460
Brother!

890
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,440
How long will you spend
mourning her death?

891
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,560
I too want to forget,
but I don't know how.

892
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:57,920
Are you doing well, aunt?

893
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,160
Oh Sai! Come son.

894
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,290
Are you fine?
- Fine.

895
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,160
The idol work is almost over.

896
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,500
Why haven't you started
offering prayers?

897
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:05,760
It's just 10 months since
Lavanya died.

898
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:09,060
You can't do such functions before
the first death anniversary.

899
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,560
How is she doing?
- Fine.

900
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,480
A major operation saved her life.

901
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:15,620
What happened to her?

902
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,420
She had a tumour.

903
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,560
Greetings.
- Are you fine?

904
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,520
Fine.

905
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,800
Did you visit Tirupathi?

906
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,640
No aunt, I made a vow to take her
to Anjaneya temple after surgery.

907
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,920
Why you have tonsured her head?

908
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,330
You have to remove hair
for head surgeries.

909
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:30,360
But they didn't do it for
Lavanya's surgery.

910
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,620
No way aunt, head surgery
warrants removal of head hair.

911
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:35,660
Really?
- Yes.

912
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,590
How can they do head surgery
without removing hair?

913
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:42,240
No way! Some doctor would've lied
to squeeze money out of you.

914
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,880
Is it?
- Yes aunt.

915
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,920
Many doctors make us pay

916
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,040
for the surgery on
already dead patients.

917
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,290
You trust all.

918
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,960
Why are you going away son?

919
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,560
What?

920
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:19,440
'I offered you prayers
ever since I know.'

921
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:22,000
'But I never asked
you for anything.'

922
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,760
'Now, I'm making a wish.'

923
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:29,040
'You helped Lord Rama by telling him
about Seetha's whereabouts.'

924
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:33,040
'I'm going on a mission to find
truth about my niece's death.'

925
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,240
'I don't want your help,
but render justice.'

926
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,670
Hail Lord Anjaneya!

927
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,970
Please sit down.

928
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,110
Where is it paining?

929
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,150
Here.

930
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,720
How long?

931
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,160
Since 10 months.

932
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:53,240
Why did you leave it
all these days?

933
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,160
Unable to decide where to start.

934
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,240
Please come here.

935
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,600
Take deep breaths.

936
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:09,110
Any pain in hands while
lifting heavy things?

937
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:10,490
No.

938
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,280
Clench your fist.

939
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,760
Who are you?
- Don't you remember me?

940
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,160
Take a good look.

941
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,040
Exactly 10 months before.

942
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,240
I begged you folding with
these same hands.

943
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:36,960
To save my niece.

944
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,910
Hey mister... You are...
- Shut up!

945
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,000
Don't instigate me to kill you.

946
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,840
Tell me, how did Lavanya die?

947
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:49,060
Did she die really
with a head injury

948
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,100
or your incompetence killed her?

949
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,270
No.

950
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,240
How did she die then? Tell me.

951
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,160
Somebody had shot her with a gun.

952
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,320
A bullet was lodged in her head.

953
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,380
She was dead when you
brought her to me.

954
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,760
Why did you lie to me that day?

955
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,680
Otherwise a man
threatened to kill me.

956
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,080
Kill you?
- Yes.

957
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,000
I didn't even take the money
he offered to me.

958
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:17,480
Who threatened you?

959
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,400
I don't know his name.
- Where will he be?

960
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,240
He just said Mehendi on phone.

961
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,690
I'll kill...

962
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:34,430
I'll kill... I'll kill him.

963
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:38,480
He's as adamant as he's innocent.

964
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,560
He'll not spare Lavanya's killers.

965
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,440
Sir, Boss from America is
on phone downstairs.

966
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,210
Boss?
- I'll come back now, hold this.

967
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,690
Greetings sir.

968
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:57,200
Mudugalle has sent
money from Sri Lanka.

969
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,370
Have you got it sir?

970
01:02:58,450 --> 01:02:59,970
Why there's a shortage
of Rs. 2 crores?

971
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,040
I mean... I mean...
dollar has depreciated...

972
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:08,770
I'll find out the reason
and call you back.

973
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:11,860
This time there will be no let ups.

974
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:17,450
Why is she sitting on floor?

975
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,130
Who is she sir?

976
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,510
Servant.

977
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,330
I lost my ring.

978
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:28,010
When I asked her, she lied
that she doesn't know.

979
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,530
What was the trouble
in Azghar's den recently?

980
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:33,940
That one! A small tiff...

981
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,210
Wrong Ramakoti,

982
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:40,970
A King Bali used to
rule India like you,

983
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,530
when he was offering prayers,

984
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:46,570
a little boy came upto him and
asked for three steps of land.

985
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:49,450
King Bali agreed seeing
the kid with umbrella.

986
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:53,930
But the boy took earth and
heaven with just two steps,

987
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,650
and buried the King underground
placing his third step on his head.

988
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,540
King Bali lost to a kid.

989
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:03,210
Is this episode also
from Bhagavat Gita?

990
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:05,010
No, it's from Bhagavatham.

991
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:08,690
Bapu is good boy.
He's promising you.

992
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,810
Find the man.

993
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:29,490
Find who lead him to Azghar.

994
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:30,990
Thank God!

995
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:32,080
Hey Jeeva.
- Sir.

996
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,090
Find who told him about Azghar.

997
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,100
Okay sir.
- Go.

998
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,530
Hey! Come here.
- What?

999
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:42,490
Who is Rasool here?

1000
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:44,410
What do I get if I tell you?

1001
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,100
It's me!

1002
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:50,610
Get him into the vehicle.

1003
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:53,850
Hey leave me... leave me.

1004
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:57,370
Greetings.

1005
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:58,680
Have it.

1006
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,330
Thank you.
- Thanks.

1007
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,050
Coffee.

1008
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,060
Coffee is extraordinary.

1009
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:16,770
Actually her hand is magical.

1010
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:17,780
Correct sir.

1011
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:19,810
Not sweet enough.

1012
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:21,280
Okay I will add some sweet.

1013
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:24,090
I'm not saying because
she's my daughter,

1014
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:27,000
she isn't suited for this modern
times, her head is bent always.

1015
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,610
May be sprained neck?
- Modesty.

1016
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:32,770
I'm surprized sometimes, have
I really brought her up like this?

1017
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:34,690
Has she really grown up like
this under my tutelage?

1018
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:38,050
Am I not lucky?
- Yes, very much.

1019
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:40,130
It's very sweet.

1020
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:42,190
Shall I add some decoction?

1021
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:48,410
The way she listens to me
and nods her head,

1022
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:50,450
if you don't think
I'm trumpeting about her,

1023
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:52,850
she's a tongue less girl.
- Really?

1024
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:56,430
Yes!

1025
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:00,730
Dear.

1026
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:01,960
Tell me.

1027
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:04,670
I want to talk.

1028
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:05,930
You stay downstairs
I'll talk to her and come.

1029
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:07,190
Tell me.

1030
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:11,700
No problem, you talk to her.

1031
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:24,330
I wrote what I felt.

1032
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:27,850
You read what you can understand
and tell what you feel like.

1033
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:57,090
Uncle, one minute.

1034
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:08,890
Sathya.

1035
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:12,420
You...?

1036
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,650
Why did you do like this?

1037
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:15,200
Isn't this shampoo good?

1038
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:17,750
I'm not talking about this.
- Then?

1039
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:20,250
I turned my heart into a pen,

1040
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:22,170
pouring all my dreams
into it as the ink,

1041
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,090
wrote my desires as the letters,

1042
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:26,970
and turned the paper
into my love,

1043
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:29,210
won't you even bother to reply it?

1044
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:32,950
That is... actually...

1045
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:36,080
I got you... you never bothered
to read it, right?

1046
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:39,400
Didn't read it?

1047
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,570
I can't read.

1048
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,170
To tell you the truth,

1049
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:44,290
...I don't know English.

1050
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:46,010
Don't know English?

1051
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,090
Yeah, I studied upto
seventh class only.

1052
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:49,690
Didn't you go to school after that?

1053
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,610
No school in my village after that.

1054
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:54,650
Do you really don't know English?
- No.

1055
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:56,930
How cute.

1056
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:03,970
Shailu... I don't know Hindi too.

1057
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:05,580
Naughty.

1058
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:05,120
"Will I say no if you wish to come?"

1059
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:08,060
Sister, no customers?
You are growing thin.

1060
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,290
Infact upswing.

1061
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:11,370
That's why you are so excited.

1062
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:12,930
What has brought you here sir?

1063
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:14,040
Where is Azghar?

1064
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,410
I'm asking you.
- A tea for him!

1065
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:19,110
Did you send washing soaps?
- I've sent sister.

1066
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,960
Azghar has vanished,
he has shifted base fearing you.

1067
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:28,200
Where he might be?

1068
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,560
There's a big fish
known as Ramakoti,

1069
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,880
people say all the
stock comes from him.

1070
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,040
I've heard but never saw.

1071
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,920
May be he's with him.

1072
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,960
Where can I find him?

1073
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,200
I don't know.

1074
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,280
If you want, take some more time.

1075
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:43,000
I really don't know sir.

1076
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:49,320
Sir.

1077
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,800
Rasool.

1078
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,920
There is a man Jeeva with Ramakoti,
he did this.

1079
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,800
Don't spare him.

1080
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:27,210
That will be my fees...
don't spare him.

1081
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:33,250
"Which district do you
belong to, hey girl?"

1082
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,350
Brother.

1083
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:00,510
Hey Pick up that knife, Jeeva!

1084
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:30,440
Hello, is it Punjagutta
Police station?

1085
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,110
Is CI there?

1086
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,760
Calling CI?

1087
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:38,370
What will you tell him?

1088
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:41,230
Will you tell him a man
turned against rowdyism?

1089
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:43,790
Will you tell a man stopped
you from selling guns?

1090
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:46,870
Will you tell a man is beating
for cutting a boy's leg?

1091
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:48,230
What will you tell him?

1092
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:51,430
Better know the truth,
I'm not beating you all for that,

1093
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:53,870
exactly 10 months before,

1094
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:56,190
an evening in the Sanjeevaiah park,

1095
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:59,230
you shot dead a little girl
playing in the swing,

1096
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:00,390
do you remember?

1097
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:04,470
If you say you forgot,
you'll die Azghar.

1098
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:08,110
I want the reason for her death.

1099
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:10,110
I want the bullet that
pierced into her head.

1100
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:11,910
I want the gun that
fired the bullet.

1101
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,740
I want the hand that held the gun.

1102
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:14,910
The finger that triggered it.

1103
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:17,870
The eye that aimed her, his life,
I want everything.

1104
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:18,870
Tell me.

1105
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:20,990
I didn't kill the girl.

1106
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:22,350
Then who killed her?

1107
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:25,950
Is it Ramakoti? Tell me.

1108
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:27,310
Tell me.

1109
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:32,470
Tell him...
tell him that I'll kill him.

1110
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:35,070
By the first death anniversary
of my dead niece,

1111
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:37,550
on the day of her anniversary,
I'll kill him.

1112
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:40,710
Two more months... 60 days...

1113
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:43,700
Let him try to stop me.

1114
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:46,630
Or else try to escape from me.

1115
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:50,160
If he can't do that tell him
to wait for death.

1116
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,670
Do you know why I'm leaving you?

1117
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:55,510
While hunting a tiger,

1118
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:58,310
I'll not waste my time
on street dogs.

1119
01:19:58,510 --> 01:19:59,510
Go!

1120
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:29,120
What's the problem?

1121
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:31,920
You recently shot dead
a little girl, right?

1122
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,680
Not I, it's we Ramakoti.
We killed her.

1123
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,900
Yes sir... I think he's a relative
of the girl we killed.

1124
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:42,750
So he has come like Arjuna
after we killed Abhimanyu.

1125
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:45,820
Mayabazaar?
- No, Mahabharata.

1126
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:47,850
Where are our men?

1127
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:50,610
They are in hospital,
he bashed them to pulp.

1128
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:51,860
Go to hospital.

1129
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:57,450
They say a surgery
can save his life.

1130
01:20:57,650 --> 01:20:59,760
It will cost us Rs. 3 lakhs.
Can I proceed?

1131
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,850
No... give a lakh to his family
after he dies.

1132
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:04,290
You can save two lakhs.

1133
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:11,370
I don't know who told
him about all this.

1134
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:14,130
Who can it be?

1135
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:16,210
Azghar says he didn't
tell him anything.

1136
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:18,890
Police are unaware of it.

1137
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,210
Ranjan is in Sri Lanka.

1138
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:23,250
Who could have told him?

1139
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:25,380
Doctor.

1140
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:30,680
Doctor.

1141
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:33,730
Next.

1142
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:39,060
Tv, VCR,
scent bottles, liquor bottles.

1143
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:40,510
That's all!
- Okay.

1144
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:42,170
Keep TV here and take VCR.

1145
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:43,650
Keep liquor bottles here
and take scent bottles.

1146
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:46,360
Sir.
- Move aside and decide. Next.

1147
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:50,890
What did you bring for me?

1148
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:53,090
I mean what did you
bring from America?

1149
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:55,500
Camera.

1150
01:21:57,490 --> 01:21:58,410
Who is here to receive you?

1151
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,690
Daddy.

1152
01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:02,170
Good, keep camera here
and take your daddy.

1153
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:03,650
Sir.

1154
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:05,370
Then keep your daddy here
and take the camera.

1155
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:06,610
Dear!
- Hi!

1156
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:08,050
Hi Neelu.
- Hi!

1157
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:09,230
Hi dear!
- Hi dad.

1158
01:22:09,310 --> 01:22:10,730
Welcome.

1159
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:13,230
Hi mother!

1160
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:15,800
Had a happy journey?
- Yes.

1161
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,330
Hi aunt.
- Hey sweety.

1162
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:18,770
Why have you grown so thin?

1163
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:20,930
Worried about marriage?

1164
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:23,490
If you talk about marriage, I'll
take the next flight to America.

1165
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:24,570
Look daddy.

1166
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:26,210
You don't mind their words, dear.

1167
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:29,410
I've 2 good proposals for you dear.

1168
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:31,090
Daddy.

1169
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:32,450
Just kidding!

1170
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:34,590
I brought a camera for you.

1171
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:35,970
Where is it?
- Here!

1172
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,420
Good?
- Very good!

1173
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,380
Thanks.

1174
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:45,210
Why have you slowed down daddy?
- I'm getting old, ain't I?

1175
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:47,890
Did you bring water?

1176
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:49,130
Oh sorry daddy.

1177
01:22:49,210 --> 01:22:51,220
I left it in the car.
I'll get it now.

1178
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,310
Okay, okay.

1179
01:22:58,580 --> 01:22:59,500
Hello!

1180
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,040
I'm Pasupathi.

1181
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,360
You took Rs 5 lakhs.

1182
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,840
If someone comes to ask you
about the girl's death,

1183
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,640
will you tell him everything
like a news reader?

1184
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:11,040
It's okay if you'd told him,

1185
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,700
you should have informed about
that to Ramakoti immediately.

1186
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,340
He would've taken precautions.

1187
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:20,930
Daughter?

1188
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:22,540
Yes.

1189
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:30,590
Dear, Neelu. Neelu!

1190
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,160
Neelu! Neelu!

1191
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:35,570
Don't harm my daughter.

1192
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:36,640
I'll not harm your daughter...

1193
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:38,510
But on one condition.
- What is it?

1194
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:40,580
Go around this tree
1000 times in one hour.

1195
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:41,870
If you stop I'll pull the trigger.

1196
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,100
Alright.
- Get up!

1197
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:44,650
I'll run.
- Come on start.

1198
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:46,170
Come on.
- Run.

1199
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:53,520
Come on run!
- Fast, fast.

1200
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,470
Faster. Run, run. Come on.

1201
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:01,430
Run!

1202
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,010
Run!

1203
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:06,880
Come man! Run. Faster.

1204
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,030
Are you tired?

1205
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,280
Run.
- Please.

1206
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,930
Come on. Fast.

1207
01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:23,550
Run.

1208
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:31,750
Come on.

1209
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:45,120
Run.

1210
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:54,710
Stop sir, by the grace of God,
he died on his own,

1211
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,430
leave her, killing in park
is unlucky to us.

1212
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,740
Go away peacefully reading Ramayana.

1213
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:05,090
We must sell guns
not use it ourselves.

1214
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:06,530
Not in the park sir.

1215
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,810
Why this house so far from city
when we have a flat in city?

1216
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:23,090
Isn't it waste?
Look, no sofa also.

1217
01:25:23,230 --> 01:25:24,970
TV is here, isn't it?
- TV?

1218
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:27,240
Congratulations brother,
no power too.

1219
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,010
Come, let's go to our flat.

1220
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:33,150
I'm not here on some work,
I'm here to avenge.

1221
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:36,230
If I stay there even after
Ramakoti's men know my place,

1222
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:38,160
staying there is...
- Not safe to you.

1223
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:40,930
Not safe to other residents.

1224
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:44,400
I can't bear if they
face trouble for me.

1225
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:46,330
That's why I came here.

1226
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:48,430
Power is restored.

1227
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:49,890
Stop!

1228
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:55,110
'Police say he would've died
around morning six.'

1229
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:58,760
'His daughter was near him
when he breathed his last.'

1230
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,770
'Our reporters say she's studying
Biotechnology in America,'

1231
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:04,210
'and she's here on a vacation.'

1232
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:05,990
Phone.

1233
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:07,210
Who is calling?

1234
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:08,570
One minute.
- Brother.

1235
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,180
Does anyone know about
our coming here?

1236
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:11,700
No.
- Who could be that?

1237
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:13,360
May be it's for
the earlier resident.

1238
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,390
Wait.

1239
01:26:28,670 --> 01:26:29,970
Don't pick up the phone.

1240
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,110
It's ringing but nobody
is picking it up.

1241
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:42,500
Wait for some more time.

1242
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:47,440
Hello.
- Got his address?

1243
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:48,890
Got it sir.
- Where?

1244
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:50,330
Road no...

1245
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:53,000
Hello. Hello. Hello.

1246
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,810
Hey! He's standing behind us.

1247
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:08,670
Get out and run!

1248
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:16,970
Mother! What are you doing?

1249
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,890
What's for lunch?

1250
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,580
Vegetable fry?

1251
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:22,570
You never prepare such
dishes when I'm there.

1252
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,590
No problem, BP is normal.

1253
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:30,210
Continue the same medicines.
- Okay.

1254
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:34,220
Candy, candy.

1255
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:36,170
Bye.
- Bye.

1256
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,120
Hello. One minute.

1257
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:42,100
Phone from the travel agency,

1258
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:44,170
they want instructions
to confirm your ticket.

1259
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:49,150
The sooner you leave India,
the better.

1260
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,670
It's better for all of us.

1261
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:54,170
We can't endure the trouble of
Police, case, and investigation.

1262
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:56,110
Mother's health is also not well.

1263
01:27:56,290 --> 01:27:59,130
Better to go away than to create
troubles about father's death.

1264
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:02,490
You can come back after
things have cooled down.

1265
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:03,560
Okay?

1266
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:05,960
Confirm the ticket.

1267
01:28:06,690 --> 01:28:08,050
Candy. Candy.

1268
01:28:08,770 --> 01:28:11,090
Greetings.
- Greetings. You are...?

1269
01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:12,570
I'm Sathyanarayanamurthy.

1270
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:14,610
I know your father very well.
- Please.

1271
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:25,380
How did it happen?

1272
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:27,660
Heart attack.

1273
01:28:30,290 --> 01:28:31,770
Were you with him then?

1274
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:34,690
We both went together for a jog.

1275
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:36,360
How did you get hurt?

1276
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:39,810
I fell down while
getting his tablets.

1277
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,720
Believable!

1278
01:28:42,930 --> 01:28:44,390
Did you narrate the
same to police also?

1279
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:45,850
What you mean?

1280
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:47,970
I know you are lying.

1281
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:49,250
Don't you know it yourself?

1282
01:28:53,950 --> 01:28:55,970
I know why your father was killed.

1283
01:28:56,770 --> 01:28:58,850
If you want to tell me
who killed him,

1284
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:00,930
if you really wish
to tell the truth,

1285
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:03,810
call me on this number.

1286
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:06,210
Bye.

1287
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:10,890
Tell something different next time.

1288
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,730
Lest they may ask how can you get
hurt backside if you fall on face.

1289
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,770
Hello.
- It's me dear.

1290
01:29:22,970 --> 01:29:26,060
I was standing next to the rowdy
who hit you in the park.

1291
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:28,570
Please don't mind,
I'll not reveal my name,

1292
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:31,450
you don't worry dear,
I'll not kill you.

1293
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:34,490
Infact I was very sad when
they killed your father.

1294
01:29:34,690 --> 01:29:38,520
He had finished 100 rounds,
just had to run another 900 only.

1295
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:40,570
It's all fate.

1296
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:42,970
Though he was a doctor himself,
he neglected his health.

1297
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:46,330
I'm telling you everything since
you are my close friend's daughter.

1298
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:50,010
If you get tempted and
give these details to police,

1299
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:52,570
you'll face your dog's fate.

1300
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:54,400
God bless you, dear. Bye.

1301
01:29:58,180 --> 01:29:59,930
Candy. Candy.

1302
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:03,100
Candy. Candy.

1303
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:05,750
Candy. Candy.

1304
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:08,140
Candy. Candy!

1305
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,890
So, you love Sathya.

1306
01:30:25,030 --> 01:30:26,050
Yes.

1307
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,930
What made you fall in love with him?

1308
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:30,330
I saw what you never saw in him.

1309
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,530
Hey girls!
Always rotten imaginations!

1310
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:35,130
Seeing his innocence.

1311
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:36,570
He's a villager.

1312
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:39,130
They are much better than city guys.
- Okay Rosy.

1313
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:42,770
City boys will ogle one girl,
go on a drive with another girl,

1314
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:44,410
and love the third girl.

1315
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:49,410
But Sathya will be steady
like a pumpkin.

1316
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:51,490
He'll not think of another
girl even in his dream.

1317
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:53,250
But will go around
with a girl in car.

1318
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:11,970
I'm also scared like everyone
about police and court.

1319
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:15,490
That's why I didn't tell
you the truth then.

1320
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:20,290
But they have entered my home,
my kitchen also.

1321
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:23,050
They killed a pup.

1322
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:28,930
My niece is crying for
the past 2 days.

1323
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:33,330
I feel like running away
to some place at times like this

1324
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:39,530
I feel like taking a stand
in situations like this.

1325
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:43,210
I can comfort you if you are sad,

1326
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,410
but I'm helpless if you are scared.

1327
01:31:47,730 --> 01:31:50,410
I saw one of my father's killers.

1328
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:54,410
Will it be okay if
I give testimony in court?

1329
01:31:55,890 --> 01:31:59,920
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm the court, judge, and jail.

1330
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:02,610
I'm the hangman, I'm the noose.

1331
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:06,950
You know the man,
I know a name.

1332
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:08,050
Let's search,

1333
01:32:08,610 --> 01:32:10,930
till you lose your fear and
till my anger subsides,

1334
01:32:11,010 --> 01:32:12,530
till our enemies die, let's search.

1335
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:21,350
This is voters list.

1336
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:23,460
What is his name?
- Ramkoti.

1337
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:34,450
2792 Ramakotis are
there in Hyderabad.

1338
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:36,110
Let's search.

1339
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,130
That's him!

1340
01:32:52,190 --> 01:32:53,310
Address.

1341
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:56,280
Address one Nav Nirman Nagar

1342
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:58,130
Kingkoti, Hyderabad.

1343
01:32:58,210 --> 01:32:59,220
Phone number.

1344
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:05,050
Who is that?

1345
01:33:05,130 --> 01:33:06,170
Is Ramakoti there?

1346
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:07,930
He's not here, who are you?

1347
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,810
I'm his son's friend. You?

1348
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:12,570
I'm his son.

1349
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:16,000
Okay.
- Can you please tell me your name?

1350
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:16,940
Why?

1351
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:18,610
You said you were my friend.

1352
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:21,570
I must recognise you
next time, mustn't I?

1353
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:23,970
Sathyanarayanamurthy.

1354
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:27,610
My name is Dhanushkoti
son of Ramakoti.

1355
01:33:27,690 --> 01:33:29,810
Okay Dhanush.
- Okay Sathipandu.

1356
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:31,190
Listen.

1357
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:34,310
If you call me like that
I'll squeeze you like a mango.

1358
01:33:34,770 --> 01:33:36,930
What's this?
You said you were my friend.

1359
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:38,470
That's what irritates me.

1360
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:41,090
I said you were my friend,
did I say I was your friend?

1361
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:42,650
Correct sir.

1362
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:44,930
Poor man felt bad.

1363
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:48,560
Who?

1364
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:49,890
Ramakoti's son.

1365
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:55,790
Telugu language is like mother,

1366
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,000
you need a mother till
you are five years.

1367
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,080
But English is like wife.

1368
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,760
Even at 60 years you need her.

1369
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:06,340
So don't brush away English cheaply.

1370
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:08,540
Okay. We'll meet in the next class.

1371
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:12,220
Hello.

1372
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:14,620
Dhanushkoti.
- Yes I am.

1373
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:16,140
May I know who are you?

1374
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:18,120
Yesterday I talked to you on phone,
your friend...

1375
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,180
Is it you Mr Murthy?
- Yes.

1376
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:23,560
How could you recognise me
among so many people here?

1377
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:26,010
You tied only one lace
in the pair of shoes.

1378
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:32,070
I was slipping all along
and I was wondering why?

1379
01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:34,050
May I know your native place please.

1380
01:34:34,130 --> 01:34:35,320
Amalapuram please.

1381
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,200
Yours?
- Peddapuram.

1382
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:38,600
I expected.

1383
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:41,160
Are you learning English here?

1384
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,160
No, they are teaching.

1385
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:44,660
Joke.

1386
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:47,430
You need to know English to
go to America, right?

1387
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:49,970
Correct. What are your hobbies?

1388
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:52,650
Seeing TV,
reading books, talking friends.

1389
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:55,950
Eating food.
- Just only six times a day sir.

1390
01:34:56,030 --> 01:34:58,820
That's it.
- It's more than enough.

1391
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,850
What are your hobbies?

1392
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:02,800
I don't have anything particularly,

1393
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,680
I'll kidnap someone
when I really get bored.

1394
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,040
Kidnap?

1395
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,130
Murder is risky business, isn't it?
What do you say?

1396
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:13,140
Yes. Kidnap is better than murder.

1397
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,790
But isn't it difficult?

1398
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:18,760
No, just make a good plan,
it's very easy.

1399
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:21,760
Whatever you say even with
a good plan, kidnap is tough.

1400
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:24,090
Don't believe me? You want to see?

1401
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:28,800
Will a whistle bring an auto?

1402
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:30,520
It'll come if you pay.

1403
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,120
My budget allows only an auto,

1404
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,480
but Maruthi van is best for kidnaps.

1405
01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:36,630
Yes, I saw in many movies.

1406
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:38,040
Hi!
- Who is these?

1407
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:41,320
You need atleast two
for a kidnap, don't you?

1408
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:42,950
He's the second man.
- He is helping you.

1409
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:44,660
Yes.
- Hi I am Dhanushkoti.

1410
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:47,000
I am Venu.
- You are so short and weak,

1411
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,030
how will you kidnap a strong man?

1412
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,440
I'll do it and he watches the show.
- Excellent.

1413
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:53,560
Get in.

1414
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:55,200
Where are we going now?

1415
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:59,160
We mustn't answer the
kidnap victim's questions.

1416
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:01,510
Sorry sir, I don't know this rule.

1417
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:03,710
Naughty. Come on. Sit down.
- Okay.

1418
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:05,850
Come on.
- Come in and sit comfortably.

1419
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:07,290
I like you Dhanush.

1420
01:36:08,290 --> 01:36:10,460
Come Dhanush, let's go in.

1421
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:14,130
Why did you hire
a lonely distant house?

1422
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:17,060
If the kidnapped raises noise,

1423
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:18,480
nobody else should listen it, right?

1424
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:21,670
It looks so simple but
you've to think a lot.

1425
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:22,970
Great.
- Come in.

1426
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,290
Tie it tightly.

1427
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:26,610
Thanks buddy.

1428
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:33,160
Whatever you say still I can't
believe kidnap is so easy.

1429
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:36,840
It's not easy, you were very
co-operative so we could do it.

1430
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:39,040
If it had been anyone else,
would they board an auto so easily?

1431
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,640
They will raise alarm, fight,
and attract a crowd.

1432
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:44,080
Then we may have to resort
to threats with weapons.

1433
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:46,310
Big nuisance.
- Right.

1434
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:48,400
It's 4 pm I've to go now.

1435
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,640
Where will you go?

1436
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:51,280
We have kidnapped you.

1437
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,250
Silly boy!

1438
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:55,760
A little while ago you said about
just showing me a trial.

1439
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,800
Will you come if I tell you?

1440
01:36:57,880 --> 01:36:59,920
Why did you kidnap me?

1441
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:03,240
Our group is AITSA!
- It means?

1442
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:05,580
All India Telugu
Speakers Association.

1443
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:06,780
Yes!

1444
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:08,880
Everyone must speak only in Telugu.

1445
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,600
The culture of mummy and
daddy should perish.

1446
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:12,680
Telugu should be used in
day to day life regularly.

1447
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,280
Till then our fight will not rest.

1448
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:16,880
We'll do any number of kidnaps
or sacrifices to achieve it.

1449
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:17,980
Nothing can stop us.

1450
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:19,430
We facilitate consequences

1451
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:22,440
we take this to national level,
international, universe...

1452
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,750
Stop brother. Calm down. Control.

1453
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,390
What are your demands?

1454
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:28,960
Don't say demands in English,
say it in Telugu.

1455
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:30,200
What are your demands?

1456
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,120
You must speak only in Telugu.

1457
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,320
Never speak in English.

1458
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,640
Will you release me
if I don't speak English?

1459
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,000
English? Say as Anglican!

1460
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:42,720
Sorry?
- Say it in Telugu.

1461
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:43,850
Okay sir.

1462
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:47,070
Again sir in English, say in Telugu.
- Okay

1463
01:37:47,150 --> 01:37:48,230
I'll...

1464
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,140
Go and see.

1465
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:53,610
Brother is not in home.

1466
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,040
Where is Sathya?

1467
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,130
Not in home, he has gone out.

1468
01:37:57,210 --> 01:38:00,440
Lie... in Telugu it is lie.

1469
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,160
I must see what's happening inside.

1470
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:03,440
No way.
- Why not?

1471
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:04,590
Should I tell everything?

1472
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:07,840
The kidnapped shouldn't ask
anything from the kidnapper.

1473
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,440
You are using English words.

1474
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:14,560
Anglican...
you shouldn't speak in English.

1475
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:15,800
I can you know.

1476
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:17,920
I'll punch you...

1477
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:20,320
I tried my level best.

1478
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:23,680
I couldn't... please don't
look sternly I'm getting nervous.

1479
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:26,250
Where is my kerchief? Is it here?
Thank you.

1480
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:27,800
Who is he?

1481
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:28,960
He's Dhanushkoti.

1482
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,040
His father is Ramakoti.

1483
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,360
We live in Kingkoti.

1484
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:32,530
House No: 1

1485
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:33,560
What are you doing here?

1486
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:35,360
They have kid...
we are playing a game.

1487
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,310
What game?

1488
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:37,880
Why did you come here?

1489
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:42,070
You carry on the game,
I'll come and join.

1490
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:43,520
Okay.
- Daddy.

1491
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:46,120
I would've come if you'd called me.

1492
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,440
How can you come?
You are very busy.

1493
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,620
Me?
- Internet cafe...

1494
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:53,200
That girl! Just met her then.

1495
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:55,560
If you touch me, I'll cut it.

1496
01:38:57,130 --> 01:39:00,260
I'm not in any way
connected to that girl.

1497
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:02,540
To tell you the truth, I don't
even know her parents names also.

1498
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:03,660
You are unnecessarily...

1499
01:39:03,810 --> 01:39:04,840
What is my mother's name?

1500
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:08,250
Your mother's name is...

1501
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:12,050
It's on the tip of tongue
but not coming out.

1502
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:14,070
That is... your mother's name is...

1503
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,510
What a great performance!
You are a cheat.

1504
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:19,080
Shailu!
- What?

1505
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:23,530
Just a girl sharing coffee with me
can't make her your competitor.

1506
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:24,860
Why are you over reacting?

1507
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:29,530
Aren't you convinced now
with my example?

1508
01:39:29,770 --> 01:39:31,720
Why did you both come
in the same car?

1509
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:34,050
Did you see that too?

1510
01:39:34,330 --> 01:39:36,870
If we don't get auto,
we ask lift, isn't it?

1511
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:38,460
I asked and she gave me.

1512
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:40,090
What's wrong in it?

1513
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:44,090
No, you are changed,
you don't love me anymore.

1514
01:39:44,170 --> 01:39:46,220
Don't love you?
How can you say that?

1515
01:39:46,450 --> 01:39:48,770
My name is Shailu, but
you called now as Neelu.

1516
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:55,070
I am really very sorry Nee...

1517
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:57,890
I know you.

1518
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:01,960
Shailu!

1519
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:31,840
This is latest model, very good.

1520
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:33,150
You take a look.

1521
01:44:33,230 --> 01:44:34,920
Father, I'm Dhanushkoti.

1522
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,740
What is it son? Why did you call me
at this hour? How are you?

1523
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:39,080
I'm fine father.

1524
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:40,150
Where are you?

1525
01:44:40,230 --> 01:44:41,280
I'm in a friend's house.

1526
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,070
Don't stay out late nights,
go home immediately.

1527
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:48,690
I mean I'm kidnapped...
my hands and legs have been tied.

1528
01:44:48,830 --> 01:44:49,690
What?

1529
01:44:49,770 --> 01:44:51,590
We have tied your son's
hands and legs.

1530
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:53,220
Who are you?

1531
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:54,470
Your son's kidnapper.

1532
01:44:54,550 --> 01:44:55,430
What do you want?

1533
01:44:55,510 --> 01:44:57,390
Where were you on last October 10th?

1534
01:44:58,450 --> 01:45:00,980
October 10th... I was with my boss.

1535
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:05,020
Someone had shot dead a little girl
in Sanjeevaiah park that day.

1536
01:45:05,390 --> 01:45:06,280
Is it you?

1537
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:07,660
Oh My God! Me?

1538
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:10,050
Is it your boss then?

1539
01:45:10,130 --> 01:45:12,780
My boss doesn't even smoke,
how can he fire a shot at a kid?

1540
01:45:12,860 --> 01:45:14,080
Who so ever the killer may be,

1541
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:17,020
tomorrow must come to the old
aluminium factory in Balanagar.

1542
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:18,460
He's not in town.

1543
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:19,610
Who is not in town?

1544
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:21,980
My boss.

1545
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:26,180
If he fails to come tomorrow,
I'll kill your son. Kill!

1546
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:42,140
Where is my son?

1547
01:45:42,930 --> 01:45:44,060
Where is your boss?

1548
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:56,380
What is it?
- Address.

1549
01:45:57,630 --> 01:45:59,340
Find it.
- Yes sir.

1550
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:14,100
Are you his boss?

1551
01:46:14,330 --> 01:46:15,460
Yes... why?

1552
01:46:29,710 --> 01:46:33,060
Were you planning to find my boss
by kidnapping my son?

1553
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,380
Is it painful?

1554
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,420
Dare to challenge me?

1555
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:54,800
Am I any provision dealer
to play with me?

1556
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:56,860
I'm an arms dealer.

1557
01:46:56,940 --> 01:47:00,300
Let me get a phone call from my son,
then I'll show you my true colour.

1558
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:01,970
What? Did you find my son?

1559
01:47:02,050 --> 01:47:03,890
No sir, he gave the wrong address.
- Wrong address?

1560
01:47:03,970 --> 01:47:05,580
It's Banjara Hills
police station address.

1561
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:07,180
Banjara Hills police station?

1562
01:47:08,650 --> 01:47:09,600
Get up!

1563
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:15,280
I blabbered nonsense
finding my son missing.

1564
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:16,980
Please don't take it to your heart.

1565
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:18,580
Why are you still watching?

1566
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:20,340
Shall I hit him?
- Hit me!

1567
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:21,310
Throw it.

1568
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:23,190
Shall I switch on the fan?

1569
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:24,540
Switch on the fan, you donkey.

1570
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:30,100
Don't look at me like that,
it's scary.

1571
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:32,560
Isn't it wrong to
give wrong address?

1572
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:35,360
If you'd shown your real boss, I
would've given you the real address.

1573
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,920
How did you know he's not my boss?

1574
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,480
You told me your boss doesn't
even smoke cigarettes.

1575
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,680
He was smoking local made
cigarette in suit.

1576
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:49,400
I made a mistake, please forgive me.
Don't harm my son.

1577
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:51,320
What is your demand?
- Your boss.

1578
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:53,960
He's not here.

1579
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,220
I don't believe.

1580
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:57,840
First time in life
I'm telling truth,

1581
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,480
I swear on my kidnapped son.

1582
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:00,880
He lives in America.

1583
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,640
Then call him here.
- Impossible.

1584
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:03,920
Come... hit me.

1585
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,600
Stop man... will you hit him
if he tells you?

1586
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:08,440
If anything happens to him,
what will be the fate of my son?

1587
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:12,240
My lord, I can't get you my boss
as ordered by you,

1588
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:14,640
but I can show him,
beyond that I'm helpless.

1589
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,810
Wait... wait.

1590
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:24,880
Yes.
- Greetings boss.

1591
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:26,800
A man here has kidnapped
my son to find you,

1592
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,960
and is threatening to kill him.

1593
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:30,890
Who is he?

1594
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:32,290
This man!

1595
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:34,110
This man!

1596
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:36,160
What do you want from me?

1597
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:39,800
the girl you killed in the
park is his niece.

1598
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:41,160
So what?
- Why did you kill her?

1599
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:43,840
Ramakoti, give him Rs. 1 million.

1600
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:46,520
Build her a mausoleum with marble.

1601
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:48,040
Why did you kill her?

1602
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:51,200
To check whether my gun
was functioning or not.

1603
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:53,160
It functioned and she died.

1604
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:57,440
Now that you know,
what will you do?

1605
01:48:57,770 --> 01:49:00,600
Don't make him angry.
He has kidnapped my son.

1606
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:02,560
Why fear him, Ramkoti?

1607
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:04,720
What will you do?

1608
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:08,520
Do you know who I am?
I'm Pasupathi.

1609
01:49:08,830 --> 01:49:12,520
I supply arms to terrorists
in 17 countries.

1610
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:15,160
I sold the gun which
Osama Bin Laden uses.

1611
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:18,400
I made the first human bomb
which LTTE blew up.

1612
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:21,680
The first land mine blown in
Cambodia was from my factory.

1613
01:49:21,890 --> 01:49:24,840
Every rocket launcher in
Kashmir is from my godown.

1614
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:30,480
She was lucky to die in my hands.

1615
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:34,720
Instead of blowing your own trumpet
sitting in some corner of the world,

1616
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:36,600
come here if you have the guts.

1617
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:37,960
What will you do if I come?

1618
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:40,920
Your country's politicians
need my money.

1619
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,640
officers need my bribes,

1620
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:44,520
naxalites need my guns,

1621
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:46,280
terrorists need my bombs,

1622
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:47,880
I want your life.

1623
01:49:48,110 --> 01:49:49,520
I will come to you,
no matter where you are.

1624
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,160
If you try to escape,
I'll catch you,

1625
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:54,880
I'll wage a war against you,
but I'll kill you for sure.

1626
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,400
"Sun rises in the east",

1627
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:59,940
"The earth is round" are facts.

1628
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:03,280
"Sathyanarayana will kill you"
is also a fact.

1629
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:06,080
Neither hunt lions
nor play games with me.

1630
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:09,280
Once the game starts,
you cannot stop it.

1631
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:12,520
What do you think you can do?
I'll kill you,

1632
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:13,760
kill your mother,

1633
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,080
kill your sister.

1634
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:16,480
But you can't even touch me.

1635
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:31,080
I'm the evil King Ravana.
I've ten heads.

1636
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:33,640
Hanuman crossed only one sea.

1637
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,240
But to kill me, you need
to cross 7 seas.

1638
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:36,200
Will you come?

1639
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,160
Can you come?

1640
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:41,560
Leave him.

1641
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:46,280
Forget about what he said.
Tell me where my son is, please.

1642
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:48,920
You said you'll show me
if I show you my boss.

1643
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:53,400
Miapur, house no. 32.

1644
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:54,800
Is it the right address?

1645
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:57,560
It must be true this time.

1646
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:03,880
Once you get my son there,
chop this man into pieces here.

1647
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:13,360
This is house no. 32.
Come, lets go.

1648
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:17,600
Now I remember.

1649
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:21,120
In Telugu, kidnap means
"Apaharana"

1650
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:24,720
Go upstairs and search.

1651
01:51:25,430 --> 01:51:26,800
People don't get it so easily.

1652
01:51:26,950 --> 01:51:31,360
To make a guy call train as
"Dhoomashakatam', I had to kill him.

1653
01:51:31,530 --> 01:51:33,280
You go and see there.

1654
01:51:39,470 --> 01:51:40,340
My mom.

1655
01:51:40,970 --> 01:51:41,880
Greetings.

1656
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:44,970
What is he?

1657
01:51:45,050 --> 01:51:48,680
Telugu master. He had been teaching
me Telugu for the past 2 days.

1658
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:50,160
They freed me today.

1659
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:51,800
Thanks sir.

1660
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:54,190
Sorry. 'Dhanyavadhamulu'.
- Goodbye.

1661
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:55,900
"Manchibaludu" Good boy.

1662
01:51:58,650 --> 01:52:01,720
His eyes are big and looking good.

1663
01:52:01,870 --> 01:52:04,270
If I keep these on his eyes,
they are gone.

1664
01:52:04,470 --> 01:52:05,950
I agree with you.

1665
01:52:06,230 --> 01:52:07,340
What do you think?

1666
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:11,040
I feel like piercing that rod into
your mouth and break his hands.

1667
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:17,300
Why do you feel so?
- Because I've freed myself.

1668
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:51,910
He is not up there too.

1669
01:52:51,990 --> 01:52:53,360
He gave us wrong address again.
Let's go.

1670
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:02,900
Hello.
- What's delaying them?

1671
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,650
My dear Dhanushkoti.

1672
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:13,890
Everything is over.

1673
01:53:14,690 --> 01:53:16,240
Open the door.

1674
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:18,290
Come in father.

1675
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,200
Dear Dhanushkoti,
thank God you're back.

1676
01:53:23,070 --> 01:53:24,510
You're safe, ah?

1677
01:53:24,970 --> 01:53:26,750
They didn't harm you, did they?
- No father.

1678
01:53:27,070 --> 01:53:30,000
Father, turn to your left.
- For what?

1679
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:36,790
You get inside and lock the room.

1680
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:41,460
Hey Jeeva! Seenu.
Where are you? Kill him.

1681
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:55,220
Shiva... Seenu, what happened
to you people?

1682
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:57,120
Where are the others?
- There aren't here.

1683
01:53:59,230 --> 01:54:00,720
You are the only one left.

1684
01:54:01,850 --> 01:54:02,980
Dear.

1685
01:54:04,950 --> 01:54:06,960
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill my son too.

1686
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:11,090
To tell you the truth, I'm innocent.
- Yes, you are innocent.

1687
01:54:11,530 --> 01:54:13,130
Smuggling guns,

1688
01:54:13,330 --> 01:54:15,170
chopping people's legs
for giving information,

1689
01:54:15,370 --> 01:54:17,250
killing people with bombs.

1690
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:19,930
Apart from these little crimes,
you know nothing.

1691
01:54:20,010 --> 01:54:21,930
I agree,
whatever I've done are crimes.

1692
01:54:22,010 --> 01:54:24,230
But I didn't kill your niece.

1693
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:28,610
You saw him killing her.

1694
01:54:28,770 --> 01:54:30,730
When a 6 year old girl was
hit by a bullet,

1695
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:36,000
you watched her die like
watching a TV serial.

1696
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:40,530
Is killing so simple to your boss?

1697
01:54:40,850 --> 01:54:43,850
I'll show how gruesome
death will be.

1698
01:54:43,930 --> 01:54:45,970
Tell me where he is.

1699
01:54:46,050 --> 01:54:48,490
I swear I'm innocent.
Please leave me.

1700
01:54:48,930 --> 01:54:50,770
Leave me, please.

1701
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:53,920
Give me his address, I'll leave you.
- I swear I do not know.

1702
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,050
Will you tell me or
do you want to die?

1703
01:54:57,010 --> 01:54:58,650
I'll tell...

1704
01:54:59,510 --> 01:55:01,330
His address is in the
diary on the table.

1705
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,010
You said you'll leave me
if I give his address.

1706
01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:08,970
I stand by my word.
I'm leaving you now.

1707
01:55:38,650 --> 01:55:39,750
Dear...

1708
01:55:45,910 --> 01:55:47,450
I asked them to come here.

1709
01:55:49,540 --> 01:55:51,370
Since you didn't turn up
even after 2 days,

1710
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:54,290
I got scared and asked
them to come here.

1711
01:55:54,980 --> 01:55:56,110
Leave it.

1712
01:55:57,830 --> 01:55:59,210
Why all this?

1713
01:55:59,650 --> 01:56:01,050
Since they killed our child,

1714
01:56:01,130 --> 01:56:03,850
do you want to kill them and
commit another crime?

1715
01:56:05,190 --> 01:56:08,580
I'm doing justice and
not committing any crime.

1716
01:56:08,660 --> 01:56:10,890
What will we achieve by doing this?

1717
01:56:11,390 --> 01:56:13,210
Come, let's go back to our village.

1718
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:15,970
Will we get back our daughter
by doing so?

1719
01:56:16,050 --> 01:56:17,610
Please think again.

1720
01:56:17,690 --> 01:56:19,170
What they did was a crime.

1721
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:21,170
It is injustice.

1722
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:24,850
If something happens to
you in the process...?

1723
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:31,130
Forget about them.

1724
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:33,610
You are her mother.

1725
01:56:33,690 --> 01:56:34,850
You tell me.

1726
01:56:35,830 --> 01:56:38,810
You must have been filled
with grief on her death.

1727
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:42,370
But when you came to know that
she was killed, weren't you angry?

1728
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:45,890
Tell me if you don't want
me to take revenge.

1729
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,210
I'll leave it here.

1730
01:56:48,730 --> 01:56:50,250
Let's go back right away.

1731
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:53,210
Shall I stop it?

1732
01:57:03,110 --> 01:57:04,330
Sathyam...

1733
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:10,460
I brought her up with these hands.

1734
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:13,890
I buried her with these hands.

1735
01:57:18,260 --> 01:57:21,130
I'll not spare him.

1736
01:57:25,250 --> 01:57:27,690
So, I can go next week.
- 100%

1737
01:57:27,770 --> 01:57:28,960
Thank you, sir.
- It's okay.

1738
01:57:30,290 --> 01:57:31,930
Please sit.
- Where is he going?

1739
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:35,170
He wants to see Charlie Chaplin,
I arranged his visa to America.

1740
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:38,570
Charlie Chaplin died long back.
- Really...?

1741
01:57:38,650 --> 01:57:39,650
Don't tell him.

1742
01:57:39,850 --> 01:57:41,250
I took Rs. 50000 from him
and spent the money too.

1743
01:57:41,470 --> 01:57:42,940
Please come.
- Who is he?

1744
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:44,330
He is my brother Sathyamurthy.

1745
01:57:44,410 --> 01:57:45,770
Very well educated.
- No, very rich man.

1746
01:57:45,850 --> 01:57:46,890
In America, he...

1747
01:57:46,970 --> 01:57:50,290
You want me to send pickles and
pappads to his relatives in America?

1748
01:57:50,370 --> 01:57:52,390
No. Send him to America.
- Okay, we'll send him.

1749
01:57:52,470 --> 01:57:54,360
Okay, send me. He will send me.
Let's go.

1750
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:55,730
Money...?

1751
01:57:56,610 --> 01:57:58,090
How much?

1752
01:57:58,450 --> 01:58:01,490
Maximum...
- Rs. 50000?

1753
01:58:01,690 --> 01:58:04,470
Rs. 50000...?
- Another Rs. 10000?

1754
01:58:04,550 --> 01:58:07,750
60000...? One lakh will do.

1755
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:10,290
It's alright.
- When do you want to go?

1756
01:58:10,370 --> 01:58:11,890
When are you planning to send me?

1757
01:58:11,970 --> 01:58:16,130
We can get the ticket but there will
be a problem in visa processing.

1758
01:58:16,210 --> 01:58:17,740
If you don't mind,
can I ask you something?

1759
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:19,970
Go ahead.
- What is Visa?

1760
01:58:22,650 --> 01:58:23,650
So, even you don't know.

1761
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:24,960
It seems he doesn't know.
- Don't take that.

1762
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:26,770
Just a second.

1763
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:31,530
Visa is the permission given
by the country you want to visit.

1764
01:58:31,670 --> 01:58:32,590
That's it.

1765
01:58:32,670 --> 01:58:33,770
Got the passport?

1766
01:58:34,390 --> 01:58:35,330
I'll take it and come back.

1767
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:39,370
I didn't mean passport size photo.

1768
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:41,930
Do you have this book?

1769
01:58:42,830 --> 01:58:45,130
What should we do to get passport?
- We have to apply.

1770
01:58:45,210 --> 01:58:48,490
Or else give me Rs. 10000,
I'll arrange for it.

1771
01:58:48,570 --> 01:58:50,050
What should we do to get visa?

1772
01:58:50,130 --> 01:58:52,490
You should do Engineering
or MBBS.

1773
01:58:52,970 --> 01:58:58,590
Will I be able to do MBBS?
- You can do it in a week.

1774
01:58:58,670 --> 01:59:03,340
I'm planning to do MBBS.
- What? Study MBBS?

1775
01:59:03,420 --> 01:59:04,610
Are you making fun of me?

1776
01:59:04,690 --> 01:59:06,010
Can we get some other's visa?

1777
01:59:06,090 --> 01:59:07,250
They will put you in jail.

1778
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:09,890
You don't have passport,
visa, education.

1779
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:11,850
No relative in America.
But you want to go to America.

1780
01:59:12,050 --> 01:59:13,430
I can't send you to America.

1781
01:59:13,510 --> 01:59:16,130
It seems he can't. Let's go.
- Just a minute.

1782
01:59:17,270 --> 01:59:19,930
Won't you give me time to think?
- Make it fast.

1783
01:59:22,090 --> 01:59:23,050
Are you married?

1784
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:25,650
There is only one way.
- What is it?

1785
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:27,210
But you shouldn't shout.

1786
01:59:27,290 --> 01:59:28,930
He won't. I'll guarantee you that.
Tell me.

1787
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:31,610
There is a Green Card.
- I've a pink card.

1788
01:59:31,690 --> 01:59:33,650
I'm not talking about
any ration cards. - Then?

1789
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:36,530
The foreigners living in
America for some years,

1790
01:59:36,610 --> 01:59:38,680
they will be permitted to
live there permanently.

1791
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:40,530
It is called Green card.

1792
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:43,400
If you marry a girl holding
a green card,

1793
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:45,170
you can go to America
along with that girl.

1794
01:59:45,250 --> 01:59:46,630
We can get girls having ration card.

1795
01:59:46,710 --> 01:59:48,450
Where can we get
girls with green card?

1796
01:59:48,530 --> 01:59:49,810
You must search.

1797
01:59:52,350 --> 01:59:53,770
Have you gone mad?

1798
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,350
Is this any game or what?

1799
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:56,540
It is marriage.

1800
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:57,820
To be to play with.

1801
01:59:59,990 --> 02:00:02,190
I've seen people who fall
in love and marry.

1802
02:00:02,510 --> 02:00:06,450
But you are the first man who wants
to marry to avenge someone.

1803
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:13,210
How can you ask a girl to be
your wife for a week?

1804
02:00:13,670 --> 02:00:14,670
Ridiculous

1805
02:00:15,090 --> 02:00:16,160
Death and marriage.

1806
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:18,300
Don't crack jokes on these two.

1807
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:21,820
I'm furious here and
you are laughing at me.

1808
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:24,200
I feel pity on you.

1809
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:28,160
You people forget those who killed
your father in front of your eyes.

1810
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:31,490
You feel scared to sign
in the registrar's book.

1811
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:33,880
You are afraid to take revenge.

1812
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:36,960
You tremble fearing that
he might gun you down.

1813
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:40,760
No. You don't have to
do any favour to me.

1814
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,360
Live happily like this.

1815
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:45,670
You get angry on silly things

1816
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:49,080
like that happen around you.

1817
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:52,040
And sometimes write articles
in English magazines.

1818
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,680
Cover your fears with
your education and live.

1819
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:58,440
I'll take care of him.

1820
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:01,760
Let him hide in America or in
any jungle, I'll find and kill him.

1821
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:05,840
Neither I'm so cultured to
forgive my father's killer,

1822
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,160
nor I'm so patient.

1823
02:01:07,450 --> 02:01:10,400
So, you'll commit the
same crime he did.

1824
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:13,480
Even Lord Ram killed Vali
from behind a tree.

1825
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:15,280
It is not that he can't kill
him from the front.

1826
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:16,560
He was forced to do it.

1827
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:19,800
Sometimes even being good
amounts to helplessness.

1828
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:20,760
Only at such instances,

1829
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:22,920
we need to protect good
even by doing wrong things.

1830
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:24,460
What I'm doing now is also the same.

1831
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:27,000
Whatever...
- It's enough. Leave it.

1832
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:44,280
I've selected 2
handsome boys for you...

1833
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:46,760
Daddy.
- I was joking.

1834
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:01,320
Madam...

1835
02:02:03,850 --> 02:02:05,560
What's the time?
- 10 o'clock.

1836
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:07,230
I'm going to take bath.

1837
02:02:07,310 --> 02:02:08,660
Get me coffee.
- Okay.

1838
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:15,800
You...
- Your madam asked me to come.

1839
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:17,640
Is she at home?
- She is taking bath. Come in.

1840
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:21,270
Who else are there at home?
- Her mother has gone to Kasi.

1841
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:24,120
What were you doing?
- Making coffee.

1842
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:26,440
Do one thing.
- Yes.

1843
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:29,800
Make another cup too.
- Okay sir. Please sit.

1844
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:36,400
English books... I don't need it.

1845
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:45,920
Padma, I'll open the door.

1846
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,340
You...?

1847
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:53,920
My name is Shailaja.
I want to talk to you.

1848
02:02:54,410 --> 02:02:55,570
Please come.

1849
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:58,820
Please sit.

1850
02:03:01,030 --> 02:03:02,080
What is it about?

1851
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:03,440
It is about Sathya.

1852
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:05,610
Did he come here?
- No.

1853
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:10,480
You were saying something.

1854
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:13,680
I and Sathya are in love.
- Good.

1855
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:16,600
But there is a
difference in him now.

1856
02:03:17,670 --> 02:03:21,050
He is not talking to me like before.
He says nothing to me.

1857
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:23,400
I can't really find him.

1858
02:03:27,010 --> 02:03:29,810
But I always see him.

1859
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:33,480
Even now I feel he is
in your verandah.

1860
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:35,880
There is no one.

1861
02:03:37,490 --> 02:03:40,860
You can' t see him. I can.
That's love.

1862
02:03:41,110 --> 02:03:42,760
Why are you telling all this to me?

1863
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:45,620
If you really don't know why
I'm telling you this, I'm lucky.

1864
02:03:45,890 --> 02:03:48,990
But if you pretend, I can't help it.

1865
02:03:49,070 --> 02:03:51,880
I really don't understand
what you are trying to say.

1866
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:53,270
Better don't understand.

1867
02:03:53,350 --> 02:03:57,490
But if you meet Sathya, tell him
that there is a girl living for him.

1868
02:03:57,570 --> 02:03:59,980
Who is she?
- It's me.

1869
02:04:08,650 --> 02:04:09,520
Hello...

1870
02:04:10,790 --> 02:04:12,750
When did you come?
- It's been quite a while.

1871
02:04:12,830 --> 02:04:14,600
You were in the shower.
So, I was just looking around.

1872
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:15,640
Do you know who came here now?

1873
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:17,550
Who?
- Shailaja.

1874
02:04:17,630 --> 02:04:19,320
Why did she come here?

1875
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:21,740
I was talking about you...

1876
02:04:21,820 --> 02:04:22,830
Don't touch me.

1877
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,070
Why?

1878
02:04:24,150 --> 02:04:26,690
You gave me the coffee made for him.

1879
02:04:26,970 --> 02:04:29,340
I got this doubt when she
brought 2 coffees.

1880
02:04:29,420 --> 02:04:30,720
What doubt?
- Yes, what doubt?

1881
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:34,200
You hid him in your house and
trying to be innocent.

1882
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:35,330
What are you talking?

1883
02:04:35,410 --> 02:04:37,000
Unable to speak unparliamentary
words, I'm talking Telugu.

1884
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:39,560
Sorry for disturbing you. You
must have been in a romantic mood.

1885
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:42,670
Carry on.
- Nothing like that. Shailu...!

1886
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:44,540
Don't tell me anything.
- Please listen to me.

1887
02:04:44,620 --> 02:04:46,200
Don't stop me.
- Stop.

1888
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:47,280
Why?

1889
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:51,000
You are taking her bag with you.
Your bag is over there.

1890
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:56,560
I thought you stopped me out
of love. Take it. Your cheap bag.

1891
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:59,400
You both dance and enjoy.
- Take it.

1892
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:03,520
There is nothing between us.

1893
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:05,840
Really?
- I swear.

1894
02:05:06,070 --> 02:05:07,700
We're just planning to marry.
That's all.

1895
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:09,320
Marriage...?
- You must come.

1896
02:05:13,060 --> 02:05:14,440
Marriage in church?

1897
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:16,520
Shailu said she'll agree anything.

1898
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:17,900
But if he ties the
auspicious thread,

1899
02:05:17,980 --> 02:05:19,020
she threatened to
chop his hands off.

1900
02:05:19,100 --> 02:05:21,480
She is an angel.
Who will do such sacrifices?

1901
02:05:21,790 --> 02:05:23,160
Please don't cry.

1902
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:26,220
Why are you crying?

1903
02:05:26,970 --> 02:05:29,200
This marriage is for namesake.

1904
02:05:30,370 --> 02:05:32,300
Are you marrying without
informing your parents?

1905
02:05:33,540 --> 02:05:36,880
At times like this, we want
our mother to be with us.

1906
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:39,000
Don't cry.

1907
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:41,040
Giving birth to children
will solve everything.

1908
02:05:41,650 --> 02:05:42,640
She is the bride.

1909
02:05:43,970 --> 02:05:45,390
Why is she crying then?

1910
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:47,120
We are lovers.

1911
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:49,490
She doesn't like this marriage.

1912
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:52,090
With your sweetheart next to you,

1913
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:53,800
Are you not ashamed to
marry another girl?

1914
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:57,640
Since I couldn't find anyone
to sign as witness...

1915
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:00,260
Oh Jesus!

1916
02:06:07,330 --> 02:06:09,130
God bless you my children.

1917
02:06:10,460 --> 02:06:14,920
Ms. Neelima, do you accept
Sathyanarayana to be your husband?

1918
02:06:15,350 --> 02:06:16,350
I don't...
- What?

1919
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:18,240
I do, I do...
- Okay.

1920
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:21,840
Do you accept Neelima
to be your wife?

1921
02:06:23,970 --> 02:06:25,560
Shailu...!
- Why is she shouting?

1922
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:26,840
She is crying.

1923
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:29,630
Are those tears of joy or pain?
- Tears of fear.

1924
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:32,800
Who is she? Friend or neighbour?
- Lover...

1925
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:35,120
Do you know that?

1926
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:37,120
She made her accept this marriage.

1927
02:06:38,440 --> 02:06:39,560
Have you brought the rings?

1928
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:41,430
Bring them.

1929
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:44,320
Exchange the rings and
never see me again.

1930
02:06:44,850 --> 02:06:50,090
[prayer]

1931
02:06:50,170 --> 02:06:51,360
Exchange the rings.

1932
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:53,800
Sister, get me a pain balm.

1933
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,680
What are you looking at?
Exchange your rings.

1934
02:07:08,260 --> 02:07:10,020
Now I declare you husband and wife.

1935
02:07:10,170 --> 02:07:12,270
You don't cry.
You may kiss the bride.

1936
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:16,030
No!

1937
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:20,120
You can't kiss anyone you like.
Kiss the bride only.

1938
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:33,280
Okay. Bye.

1939
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:36,220
Will you really divorce her?
- Don't have any doubt?

1940
02:11:36,300 --> 02:11:37,530
Promise.
- Promise.

1941
02:11:37,610 --> 02:11:39,500
Do you think I will live with her?

1942
02:11:39,690 --> 02:11:42,970
Only blind will marry her.
Shit face!

1943
02:11:43,050 --> 02:11:44,490
I married her because
I had no other choice.

1944
02:11:44,570 --> 02:11:46,090
You really don't like her?

1945
02:11:46,170 --> 02:11:47,650
Have you seen her face before?

1946
02:11:47,850 --> 02:11:50,450
Her eyes are like the
crowns of Thumps up.

1947
02:11:50,530 --> 02:11:53,130
And her lips are like
the jeans pant zip.

1948
02:11:53,210 --> 02:11:58,130
Herself and you for before and
after using a health tonic ad.

1949
02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:07,480
Ticket.

1950
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:12,810
Has she heard our conversation?

1951
02:12:18,600 --> 02:12:19,570
2 coffees please.

1952
02:12:19,810 --> 02:12:20,850
I don't want.

1953
02:12:20,930 --> 02:12:22,410
2 coffees for us.

1954
02:12:25,490 --> 02:12:26,770
Thanks.
- Hello.

1955
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:27,970
You...?

1956
02:12:28,350 --> 02:12:30,730
Last time she brought
camera from US.

1957
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:33,010
I didn't bring it. You took it.

1958
02:12:33,090 --> 02:12:34,780
So, you were in customs, ah?
- Yes.

1959
02:12:34,860 --> 02:12:36,530
For now, he is in worries.

1960
02:12:37,130 --> 02:12:38,530
Good is misunderstood.

1961
02:12:38,730 --> 02:12:40,650
I'm used to be friendly
with everyone.

1962
02:12:40,850 --> 02:12:43,730
One day, I took a camera from a boy.

1963
02:12:43,930 --> 02:12:45,410
He gave me the camera
he had in his hand to me.

1964
02:12:45,610 --> 02:12:47,410
He shot the proceedings with
the camera he had in his pocket

1965
02:12:47,490 --> 02:12:48,810
and informed the TV media.

1966
02:12:48,890 --> 02:12:50,730
My seniors gave me this uniform.

1967
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:52,770
Did they dismiss you?
- They told me to get out.

1968
02:12:53,020 --> 02:12:54,340
You didn't give me the change.
- I'm not used to it.

1969
02:12:54,420 --> 02:12:55,410
Let's go.

1970
02:12:56,420 --> 02:12:58,130
Sathya!
- Going on honeymoon?

1971
02:12:58,210 --> 02:12:59,060
Yes.

1972
02:12:59,140 --> 02:13:00,740
Who is she?
- My wife.

1973
02:13:00,820 --> 02:13:03,160
And who is she?
- My future wife.

1974
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:06,050
You must live in
America not in India.

1975
02:13:06,570 --> 02:13:07,740
I'm going there.

1976
02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:09,690
Thank you. It's okay.

1977
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:12,220
Good evening ma'am.
- Good evening.

1978
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:14,370
Good evening, sir.
- Greetings.

1979
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:16,570
Do you know me?
- Excuse me.

1980
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:18,530
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

1981
02:13:18,610 --> 02:13:20,830
May I help you sir?
- Greeting everyone...?

1982
02:13:21,090 --> 02:13:22,570
May be she is mad.

1983
02:13:24,430 --> 02:13:26,980
Neelu, is the seat nice?
We paid a lot for it.

1984
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:29,330
Calling me as if I'm your wife?

1985
02:13:29,410 --> 02:13:30,570
Be careful.

1986
02:13:30,980 --> 02:13:32,700
What happened? Why are you angry?
- I say don't talk.

1987
02:13:33,620 --> 02:13:36,120
Crushed face!
As if he is very handsome.

1988
02:13:36,970 --> 02:13:38,620
Sir whisky or rum.

1989
02:13:39,220 --> 02:13:40,980
It won't look nice
in front of ladies.

1990
02:13:41,670 --> 02:13:43,280
Ma'am.
- Whisky.

1991
02:13:45,590 --> 02:13:46,910
Oh my God!

1992
02:13:54,290 --> 02:13:57,390
'Indian High Commissioner is
coming to you with the FBI.'

1993
02:13:57,670 --> 02:13:59,430
Sorry, sir. I couldn't stop them.

1994
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:08,950
Mr Pasupathi,

1995
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:11,460
FBI has got information
that you are selling guns.

1996
02:14:11,540 --> 02:14:13,240
We have filed a charge sheet.

1997
02:14:16,910 --> 02:14:18,190
Am I selling guns?

1998
02:14:18,930 --> 02:14:21,510
Since I'm contesting
the Mayor elections,

1999
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,760
someone is trying mar my reputation.

2000
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:28,060
Sir, I'm Ramakoti speaking.

2001
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:32,470
Because of Sathya,
4 of our men died in a blast.

2002
02:14:32,550 --> 02:14:34,750
Police found out it is RDX.

2003
02:14:34,830 --> 02:14:36,700
I was in jail till yesterday.

2004
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,300
Now I'm out on bail.

2005
02:14:38,380 --> 02:14:39,820
And you are in danger.

2006
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:41,540
Why aren't you saying anything?

2007
02:14:41,620 --> 02:14:45,060
Sathya is on the way to America.

2008
02:14:45,140 --> 02:14:46,980
We killed a doctor.

2009
02:14:47,060 --> 02:14:48,290
His daughter is bringing
him along with her.

2010
02:14:48,620 --> 02:14:51,540
Be careful.

2011
02:14:51,800 --> 02:14:53,450
Don't worry we'll take care of him.

2012
02:14:54,760 --> 02:14:56,020
I am sorry Pasupathi.

2013
02:14:56,100 --> 02:14:58,080
It's better to withdraw
yourself from the elections.

2014
02:14:58,850 --> 02:15:02,060
We'll seize all your
bank accounts, business.

2015
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:05,580
Not only that, no paper should
go out of this building.

2016
02:15:05,810 --> 02:15:07,310
From this moment
this property will be

2017
02:15:07,390 --> 02:15:09,410
under the surveillance
of united state of America.

2018
02:15:09,490 --> 02:15:10,660
Let's go officers

2019
02:15:14,450 --> 02:15:15,810
Amin.
- Sir.

2020
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:18,180
I need a powerful bomb.
- Sir.

2021
02:15:18,260 --> 02:15:22,420
It should be so powerful
when it blows up,

2022
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:25,850
FBI shouldn't get a paper
from this building.

2023
02:15:25,930 --> 02:15:27,260
Okay?
- Okay, sir.

2024
02:15:27,550 --> 02:15:29,780
It's an emergency boys,
pack everything guns

2025
02:15:29,860 --> 02:15:33,810
dollars, passports, gold and
everything. Leave nothing.

2026
02:15:34,020 --> 02:15:35,220
They shouldn't get anything.

2027
02:15:35,420 --> 02:15:37,000
Until we move out from here,
be careful.

2028
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:38,630
Be alert. Okay?
- Sir.

2029
02:15:38,940 --> 02:15:40,660
Sathyanarayanamurthy
who Ramakoti had mentioned...

2030
02:15:42,330 --> 02:15:43,490
Keep our man at the airport.

2031
02:15:43,570 --> 02:15:44,570
Okay, sir.

2032
02:15:58,740 --> 02:16:00,140
Give me that bag.
- It's alright.

2033
02:16:00,340 --> 02:16:01,100
I said give it to me.

2034
02:16:01,660 --> 02:16:02,820
You have brought me here.

2035
02:16:02,900 --> 02:16:03,980
Can't I help you?

2036
02:16:04,140 --> 02:16:05,300
Give me my bag.

2037
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:07,550
I think you are angry with somebody.

2038
02:16:07,630 --> 02:16:08,620
Not someone. Angry on you.

2039
02:16:08,700 --> 02:16:09,680
For what reason?

2040
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:11,280
Are my lips like jeans pant zip?

2041
02:16:12,020 --> 02:16:13,900
Are my eyes like Thumps up crown?

2042
02:16:14,420 --> 02:16:16,750
Do you feel pity on me?
I hate you.

2043
02:16:17,060 --> 02:16:18,700
Whenever I see you I feel angry.

2044
02:16:19,070 --> 02:16:21,100
So, you heard everything I said.

2045
02:16:22,370 --> 02:16:23,820
It is wrong to over hear
other's conversation.

2046
02:16:23,900 --> 02:16:24,980
Whatever you said, isn't that wrong?

2047
02:16:25,310 --> 02:16:27,340
I felt like saying that...

2048
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:29,130
I feel like doing this...
- Do what?

2049
02:16:29,210 --> 02:16:30,900
That's our marriage certificate.

2050
02:16:32,330 --> 02:16:33,770
What have you done?
- Don't touch me.

2051
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:35,110
Never show your face to me again.

2052
02:16:35,190 --> 02:16:37,140
I know no one other than
you in this country.

2053
02:16:37,310 --> 02:16:38,940
Is any problem?
- No. Nothing.

2054
02:16:39,020 --> 02:16:40,570
Okay.
- Thank you.

2055
02:16:43,100 --> 02:16:45,140
Do you know him?
- Shall I call him?

2056
02:16:46,630 --> 02:16:47,860
If you follow me again,

2057
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:49,860
I'll inform him and get you
arrested. Be careful.

2058
02:16:52,050 --> 02:16:53,420
Madam...

2059
02:16:59,300 --> 02:17:02,050
Hello... Oh shit!

2060
02:17:17,140 --> 02:17:18,310
Hello.

2061
02:17:20,420 --> 02:17:21,340
Telugu...?

2062
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:27,650
Yes, I'm a Telugu speaking man. You?

2063
02:17:28,010 --> 02:17:29,040
Telugu.

2064
02:17:30,620 --> 02:17:31,970
Brother...
- Oh no!

2065
02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:33,720
Control. Control yourself.

2066
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:34,870
Brother.

2067
02:17:35,190 --> 02:17:38,170
I never thought I would meet a
Telugu speaking man again in my life.

2068
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:39,590
Don't get emotional.

2069
02:17:39,670 --> 02:17:40,670
Tell me what happened?

2070
02:17:41,750 --> 02:17:43,950
I and my wife landed in
America just now.

2071
02:17:44,030 --> 02:17:47,310
So you are married.
- Yes. 2 days back.

2072
02:17:47,510 --> 02:17:49,380
So, you've come here
on a honeymoon. - Yes.

2073
02:17:49,460 --> 02:17:50,830
Where is she?

2074
02:17:51,790 --> 02:17:53,820
She divorced me just now.

2075
02:17:53,900 --> 02:17:55,830
Divorce? Reason?

2076
02:17:57,180 --> 02:17:58,710
Because I can't speak in English.

2077
02:17:59,770 --> 02:18:00,930
Come on.

2078
02:18:01,010 --> 02:18:02,430
Don't worry.

2079
02:18:02,510 --> 02:18:04,150
Life in America is like this only.

2080
02:18:04,230 --> 02:18:08,470
For not making coffee,
for not chaining a dog,

2081
02:18:09,010 --> 02:18:10,580
They divorce for
anything and everything.

2082
02:18:11,070 --> 02:18:12,070
Sit.

2083
02:18:16,030 --> 02:18:16,890
Where do you want to go?

2084
02:18:18,260 --> 02:18:19,670
Oh! You know no one here.

2085
02:18:20,670 --> 02:18:21,910
Shall we go to any hotel?

2086
02:18:23,670 --> 02:18:25,040
Oh I am sorry.

2087
02:18:26,090 --> 02:18:27,070
Come to my house.

2088
02:18:28,710 --> 02:18:29,990
Thanks.

2089
02:18:33,390 --> 02:18:35,530
My name is Sathyanarayanamurthy.

2090
02:18:35,610 --> 02:18:37,030
People call me Sathipandu.

2091
02:18:37,110 --> 02:18:38,030
My name is Shanthiswaroop.

2092
02:18:38,390 --> 02:18:39,390
People call me Shanthi.

2093
02:18:40,050 --> 02:18:41,790
What do you want?
- Shake hands.

2094
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:45,880
Can we get breakfast here?

2095
02:18:46,150 --> 02:18:48,030
Sathipandu, have bananas.

2096
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:52,070
I'm native of Cuddapah.

2097
02:18:52,660 --> 02:18:54,110
I lived there for 30 years.

2098
02:18:54,610 --> 02:18:57,150
From my childhood,
I hated violence.

2099
02:18:57,590 --> 02:18:58,750
I'm scared of bombs.

2100
02:18:59,110 --> 02:19:00,120
I'm afraid of kidnaps.

2101
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:01,950
And murders...?
- I don't see them.

2102
02:19:02,290 --> 02:19:05,950
Since my name doesn't match
with my place, I came here.

2103
02:19:06,030 --> 02:19:07,650
How do you feel in this country?

2104
02:19:07,730 --> 02:19:09,190
Very peaceful.

2105
02:19:09,270 --> 02:19:10,390
It's a free country, you know.

2106
02:19:10,470 --> 02:19:11,750
We can do anything we want.

2107
02:19:13,190 --> 02:19:15,430
Don't throw it out.
They'll put us in jail.

2108
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:17,560
Very good.

2109
02:19:17,640 --> 02:19:19,720
Here, we can live as we like.
- Is it?

2110
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:24,080
Hello.

2111
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:25,670
Stop ogling at her like that?

2112
02:19:26,130 --> 02:19:27,090
She might file a case on you?

2113
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:28,460
Case...?
- Yes.

2114
02:19:28,540 --> 02:19:31,110
Just like you, in the beginning,
even I tried to trap a girl.

2115
02:19:31,380 --> 02:19:32,520
Later, I was fined.

2116
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:33,830
Really...?
- Promise.

2117
02:19:36,390 --> 02:19:39,070
Just look at them.
May be they don't have a home.

2118
02:19:39,540 --> 02:19:40,500
Poor guys!

2119
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:41,990
People are very
good and friendly here.

2120
02:19:42,150 --> 02:19:43,300
Very friendly people.

2121
02:19:43,380 --> 02:19:45,680
Hi!
- Hey you...

2122
02:19:45,910 --> 02:19:47,450
Why is he showing his middle finger?

2123
02:19:47,530 --> 02:19:50,030
His finger is swollen.

2124
02:19:50,260 --> 02:19:52,360
They believe that if they show it
to everyone, it will get cured.

2125
02:19:52,440 --> 02:19:53,550
Very superstitious!

2126
02:20:00,060 --> 02:20:01,710
The colony is very quiet.

2127
02:20:01,790 --> 02:20:03,790
The security is very tight.

2128
02:20:03,870 --> 02:20:06,510
To tell you the fact, this is the
safest place in America.

2129
02:20:06,590 --> 02:20:08,220
But at 8 pm, no one should go out.

2130
02:20:08,300 --> 02:20:09,560
Will it be very cold?
- It'll be very scary.

2131
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:11,950
What?
- They will gun you down for money.

2132
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:13,870
They call it as mugging.

2133
02:20:14,070 --> 02:20:14,990
Before 8, it is your wish.

2134
02:20:15,070 --> 02:20:16,270
After 8, it is your luck.

2135
02:20:17,020 --> 02:20:19,580
Even thieves have a time to steal.

2136
02:20:20,060 --> 02:20:21,070
I forgot to take my bag.

2137
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:26,690
Hi Neelu!
- This is the 10th time.

2138
02:20:26,770 --> 02:20:28,270
I've come from India 10 times.

2139
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:30,550
Not even once did you
receive me properly.

2140
02:20:30,870 --> 02:20:32,150
Actually...
- What is this uncle?

2141
02:20:32,230 --> 02:20:34,650
This time, I came on time
to the right airport.

2142
02:20:34,730 --> 02:20:36,740
But you came by yourself.
- Okay. Come.

2143
02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:38,230
Sathipandu...
- Yes.

2144
02:20:39,270 --> 02:20:40,310
Sathipandu...
- Yes.

2145
02:20:40,390 --> 02:20:41,270
I'm coming.

2146
02:20:41,350 --> 02:20:42,550
She is my daughter.

2147
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:47,680
Ms Neelima.

2148
02:20:47,880 --> 02:20:48,950
Very nice name

2149
02:20:49,910 --> 02:20:51,350
Sathipandu...
- Yes uncle.

2150
02:20:52,450 --> 02:20:53,430
You called me 'brother'?

2151
02:20:53,630 --> 02:20:54,550
You said she is your daughter.

2152
02:20:54,910 --> 02:20:55,830
Who is he?

2153
02:20:56,120 --> 02:20:57,670
My friend Sathipandu.

2154
02:20:57,950 --> 02:20:59,290
He got married 2 days back,

2155
02:20:59,370 --> 02:21:00,630
and got divorced 2 hours back.

2156
02:21:00,930 --> 02:21:02,390
His wife divorced him for
not speaking in English.

2157
02:21:02,470 --> 02:21:03,830
Nothing like that. He is lying.

2158
02:21:03,910 --> 02:21:04,940
Girls of this generation...
- Stop.

2159
02:21:05,480 --> 02:21:07,720
She is trying to say something.
Please say it.

2160
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:09,400
Will you bring anybody to our house?

2161
02:21:09,710 --> 02:21:10,710
Won't you know what kind
of a man he is?

2162
02:21:10,790 --> 02:21:11,670
What else do you want?

2163
02:21:11,750 --> 02:21:13,070
His wife has divorced him.

2164
02:21:13,150 --> 02:21:14,190
From that we know
he is very innocent.

2165
02:21:15,610 --> 02:21:16,730
Don't worry.

2166
02:21:17,140 --> 02:21:18,690
Okay, I'll take it.

2167
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:24,110
Why did you come here?

2168
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:25,590
I didn't know this is your house.

2169
02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:26,810
Now that you know, go.

2170
02:21:26,890 --> 02:21:27,950
I don't know anyone else.

2171
02:21:28,510 --> 02:21:30,210
Then, go to some hotel.
- I don't know the way.

2172
02:21:30,290 --> 02:21:32,110
Go to hell.
- I don't know the way for that too.

2173
02:21:32,690 --> 02:21:34,360
Why are you frustrating
me like this?

2174
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:36,410
What is the relation
between you and me?

2175
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:43,740
You can't take it.

2176
02:21:43,820 --> 02:21:45,130
Sathipandu.
- Yes uncle...

2177
02:21:45,420 --> 02:21:46,580
You are looking very tired.

2178
02:21:46,830 --> 02:21:48,300
Will you have a tub bath?
- What uncle?

2179
02:21:48,380 --> 02:21:49,560
Tub bath.

2180
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:50,710
Sure.

2181
02:21:51,440 --> 02:21:54,230
Neelima, fill the tub will
hot water for him.

2182
02:21:55,750 --> 02:21:58,390
Want hot water?
I'll teach you a lesson.

2183
02:22:05,660 --> 02:22:07,470
You haven't taken bath yet!
- No uncle.

2184
02:22:07,550 --> 02:22:08,420
Go ahead if you want to.

2185
02:22:08,500 --> 02:22:09,590
I'm not in a hurry.

2186
02:22:09,950 --> 02:22:11,830
You are elder to me.
I'll bath after you.

2187
02:22:13,320 --> 02:22:15,200
I like the way you respect people.
- Thanks.

2188
02:22:25,950 --> 02:22:26,910
Careful.

2189
02:22:29,770 --> 02:22:30,920
Uncle.
- What?

2190
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,970
Shall I serve hot rice?

2191
02:22:33,970 --> 02:22:37,190
I think avoiding hot foods for
few days will be better.

2192
02:22:37,270 --> 02:22:38,270
Okay.

2193
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:40,860
This is...?
- Yours uncle.

2194
02:22:40,940 --> 02:22:42,360
To keep myself warm.

2195
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:43,580
Okay carry on.

2196
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:45,950
Gravy...?
- I know.

2197
02:22:47,410 --> 02:22:49,990
Don't mind, she's off mood.

2198
02:22:50,580 --> 02:22:53,770
Why are you so angry?
What will you gain from it?

2199
02:22:54,700 --> 02:22:56,510
A rare Telugu visitor has
come to our home,

2200
02:22:57,030 --> 02:23:00,030
speaking to him in Telugu,
eating Telugu delights,

2201
02:23:00,570 --> 02:23:01,630
listening Telugu songs,

2202
02:23:02,870 --> 02:23:05,020
isn't it enough if we sleep
peacefully into eternity?

2203
02:23:07,910 --> 02:23:09,290
I was just joking.

2204
02:23:20,530 --> 02:23:21,900
Come out.
- Let's go...

2205
02:23:21,980 --> 02:23:23,110
don't know how many are they?

2206
02:23:27,880 --> 02:23:30,270
What a great speed!
Were you a pilot earlier?

2207
02:23:30,350 --> 02:23:31,270
No, I drove tractors.

2208
02:23:31,350 --> 02:23:34,310
Pull over, I want to
answer a nature's call.

2209
02:23:34,700 --> 02:23:36,870
That's what I'm searching
still not yet found it.

2210
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:41,640
Hey you! Get lost.

2211
02:23:41,870 --> 02:23:43,640
Use lemon to cool your finger.

2212
02:23:43,810 --> 02:23:45,030
Finger problem.

2213
02:23:46,150 --> 02:23:47,180
Uncle.

2214
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:48,390
Who are those rowdies?

2215
02:23:48,470 --> 02:23:50,550
How do I know? You are in America

2216
02:23:50,630 --> 02:23:52,400
for long to know them.
- Me?

2217
02:23:52,480 --> 02:23:54,960
You'll get into trouble if you
bring strangers to home.

2218
02:23:55,230 --> 02:23:57,230
Your ring is very beautiful,
let me see it.

2219
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:00,590
He can't even speak English,
how can he have enemies here?

2220
02:24:01,370 --> 02:24:03,770
Uncle, do you have any enemies here?

2221
02:24:04,100 --> 02:24:06,080
I'm also thinking all the while.

2222
02:24:06,430 --> 02:24:09,070
I don't have any trouble
with anyone,

2223
02:24:09,350 --> 02:24:11,210
but I went to a shop
to buy a brief,

2224
02:24:11,450 --> 02:24:13,350
I argued with him as
he quoted high price.

2225
02:24:13,430 --> 02:24:14,670
What a great mistake!

2226
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:17,390
He quoted 5 dollars for a brief.

2227
02:24:17,470 --> 02:24:19,590
Did you buy?
- Am I mad?

2228
02:24:19,670 --> 02:24:21,550
I said I'll not buy and
told him to go to hell.

2229
02:24:21,980 --> 02:24:24,210
You've invited trouble for a brief.

2230
02:24:24,290 --> 02:24:25,830
Would he be so hurt for a brief?

2231
02:24:25,910 --> 02:24:27,190
Can't say! They are white men!

2232
02:24:27,270 --> 02:24:29,750
I'll not use briefs anymore,
to hell with it.

2233
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:32,760
Oh my God! They are coming.

2234
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:34,390
Is it the same gang?

2235
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:38,790
Sorry Neelima. Sorry Sathipandu.
You got into trouble because of me.

2236
02:24:39,070 --> 02:24:41,590
What's risk in it?
Taking risk for friendship is...

2237
02:24:49,880 --> 02:24:51,890
They are coming.
- You don't worry uncle.

2238
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:04,400
Nothing happened, isn't it?

2239
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:05,430
Are you happy now?

2240
02:25:09,710 --> 02:25:10,590
Get down.

2241
02:25:10,670 --> 02:25:12,020
Sathipandu!
- Get down.

2242
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:13,660
Go to hell.

2243
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:20,850
Oh no! He is crazy.

2244
02:25:29,650 --> 02:25:31,020
Sathipandu!

2245
02:25:36,900 --> 02:25:38,080
Ladies and gentlemen

2246
02:25:38,300 --> 02:25:43,520
famous music director Mani Sharma
will entertain you with his music.

2247
02:25:44,410 --> 02:25:45,390
Sathipandu.
- Yes.

2248
02:25:45,470 --> 02:25:47,990
Looks like some rich man's wedding,
come let's go away from here.

2249
02:25:48,070 --> 02:25:50,910
Please.
- Okay, let's take him also.

2250
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:54,630
Sir.

2251
02:25:54,780 --> 02:25:56,360
Care for a whisky to cool yourself.

2252
02:25:58,600 --> 02:25:59,760
How about a brandy?

2253
02:26:02,320 --> 02:26:03,350
It heats up.

2254
02:26:05,820 --> 02:26:07,110
It's like arrack.

2255
02:26:08,030 --> 02:26:09,030
Arrack?

2256
02:26:09,110 --> 02:26:10,150
Give me.

2257
02:26:13,260 --> 02:26:15,910
Yes arrack, it cools you,
get some more.

2258
02:26:17,950 --> 02:26:19,840
Enough, you've already
had ten glasses.

2259
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:23,910
Uncle, if guests are
given such seats,

2260
02:26:24,230 --> 02:26:25,980
think about the seats for
the marrying couple.

2261
02:26:26,060 --> 02:26:27,310
It's for them only.

2262
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:31,470
Sorry sir, I lost myself in this.

2263
02:30:37,430 --> 02:30:39,640
Come... come out...
- Let's go, Sathipandu.

2264
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:40,970
Your dance was amazing.

2265
02:30:41,050 --> 02:30:42,500
I didn't dance,
it was American arrack.

2266
02:30:42,580 --> 02:30:43,620
It's morning now,
let's go home.

2267
02:30:43,700 --> 02:30:45,490
No, let's go to a hotel.
- Okay.

2268
02:30:46,770 --> 02:30:47,930
Get off.
- Let's run.

2269
02:30:48,010 --> 02:30:49,720
It's them... leave my hand...
- Let's go.

2270
02:30:49,800 --> 02:30:51,510
Hey come on, come on get them.

2271
02:31:07,070 --> 02:31:08,910
You are bleeding.
- No problem.

2272
02:31:09,930 --> 02:31:11,130
I am sorry.

2273
02:31:11,210 --> 02:31:12,930
It all happened because of me.

2274
02:31:13,670 --> 02:31:14,940
I am sorry.

2275
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:16,810
Thank you.

2276
02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:20,450
What are you looking at?

2277
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:21,950
Nothing.

2278
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:24,200
Come on say something.

2279
02:31:24,740 --> 02:31:27,170
You are beautiful
when you speak in English.

2280
02:31:28,540 --> 02:31:29,490
Can I ask you a thing?

2281
02:31:31,390 --> 02:31:34,300
You always say something
at me... what's that?

2282
02:31:34,790 --> 02:31:37,960
Go... Go...
- Go to hell.

2283
02:31:38,140 --> 02:31:39,740
Yes. What does it mean?

2284
02:31:41,650 --> 02:31:42,690
It means...

2285
02:31:44,070 --> 02:31:45,390
Be happy wherever you are.

2286
02:31:46,780 --> 02:31:47,990
You are a good girl.

2287
02:31:49,030 --> 02:31:50,660
Why would you help me then?

2288
02:31:52,270 --> 02:31:53,380
Thank you.

2289
02:32:03,150 --> 02:32:04,240
Here... This side...

2290
02:32:12,140 --> 02:32:15,890
Don't fear... I'm next to you,
up above Lord is there.

2291
02:32:16,630 --> 02:32:18,090
Hail Lord Anjaneya!

2292
02:32:25,400 --> 02:32:26,750
Over there.

2293
02:32:27,360 --> 02:32:28,370
Hello.
- Neelu.

2294
02:32:28,450 --> 02:32:30,090
Be careful, rowdies are
coming towards you.

2295
02:32:59,890 --> 02:33:02,020
Sathipandu! Sathipandu!

2296
02:33:02,290 --> 02:33:03,210
Do you've any sense?

2297
02:33:03,290 --> 02:33:04,690
Will you call when
they were leaving?

2298
02:33:04,770 --> 02:33:05,850
To warn you...

2299
02:33:05,930 --> 02:33:07,690
You didn't warn us,
you gave signal to them.

2300
02:33:07,970 --> 02:33:10,430
You and Neelima are safe,
aren't you?

2301
02:33:10,510 --> 02:33:12,280
Yes. Neelu.

2302
02:33:14,380 --> 02:33:15,550
Neelu!

2303
02:33:16,870 --> 02:33:17,890
Neelu!

2304
02:33:26,960 --> 02:33:32,050
You look sexy with bleed,
but no time to play with you.

2305
02:33:32,710 --> 02:33:34,610
Where is he?

2306
02:33:35,310 --> 02:33:37,810
So many couldn't bring one man?

2307
02:33:40,910 --> 02:33:41,910
Sir.

2308
02:33:41,990 --> 02:33:43,410
Brought it?
- Yes sir.

2309
02:33:50,410 --> 02:33:53,030
It is so small,
can it blow up the building?

2310
02:33:53,110 --> 02:33:53,970
No doubt.

2311
02:33:54,490 --> 02:33:56,050
I'll place the bomb in the lift.

2312
02:33:56,690 --> 02:33:57,650
This is remote control,

2313
02:33:58,050 --> 02:34:00,410
when you switch on
the doors of the lift will close.

2314
02:34:00,490 --> 02:34:03,290
lift will go down,
you'll board helicopter,

2315
02:34:03,370 --> 02:34:06,450
lift will take 4 minutes
to reach ground floor.

2316
02:34:06,530 --> 02:34:08,890
By that time you'll be far away
from this building.

2317
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:10,970
How will the bomb go off?

2318
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:12,920
We needn't trigger it sir,

2319
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,490
the trigger is also in the lift,

2320
02:34:14,930 --> 02:34:16,620
when the lift touches
the ground floor,

2321
02:34:16,700 --> 02:34:18,330
bomb will blow on it's own.

2322
02:34:18,920 --> 02:34:21,850
Bloody, this is more sexy than her.

2323
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:33,090
Where are you Neelu?
- Under me.

2324
02:34:33,410 --> 02:34:34,850
Any objections?

2325
02:34:35,230 --> 02:34:37,420
I'll kill you.

2326
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:40,000
Certainly, do as you say.

2327
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:44,090
But the problem is I don't have time
and your time is running bad.

2328
02:34:44,170 --> 02:34:46,480
Don't show your prowess on a girl,

2329
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:48,290
if you have guts tell me your place,
I'll come to you.

2330
02:34:48,370 --> 02:34:50,210
Will you?
- No doubt.

2331
02:34:51,420 --> 02:34:54,530
550 Hope street,
you find a telephone booth,

2332
02:34:54,930 --> 02:34:57,590
come there, let's discuss
other things then.

2333
02:34:57,740 --> 02:35:00,210
I'm coming, if anything happens
to Neelu mean while...

2334
02:35:00,290 --> 02:35:02,690
I'll try not to harm,
but I can't promise.

2335
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:06,440
Ravana gave Seetha one year's time,

2336
02:35:06,960 --> 02:35:10,120
I'm giving her one hour,
60 minutes.

2337
02:35:13,750 --> 02:35:15,180
Pack the bags.
- Yes sir.

2338
02:35:17,890 --> 02:35:19,090
Excuse me.
- Yes.

2339
02:35:19,170 --> 02:35:20,150
Is it Hope Street

2340
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:21,570
Tell me, sir.
- It's near by.

2341
02:35:25,860 --> 02:35:27,400
Hello.
- Is the coat nice?

2342
02:35:28,390 --> 02:35:30,680
She's more beautiful
without the coat.

2343
02:35:30,760 --> 02:35:33,550
Don't play with me,
tell me where is Neelu?

2344
02:35:33,630 --> 02:35:36,280
You are a hasty man.

2345
02:35:37,310 --> 02:35:39,030
Can you see another telephone
booth opposite side?

2346
02:35:40,350 --> 02:35:42,070
It'll ring immediately
when I cut this call.

2347
02:35:42,350 --> 02:35:43,990
It will ring only thrice,

2348
02:35:44,490 --> 02:35:46,070
if you pick it up before
that I'll tell you.

2349
02:35:46,410 --> 02:35:47,350
If you fail...

2350
02:35:48,700 --> 02:35:49,890
Hello!

2351
02:36:07,380 --> 02:36:10,270
You broke the glass to pick it up,

2352
02:36:10,930 --> 02:36:12,830
by any chance, do you love her?

2353
02:36:12,910 --> 02:36:13,960
Tell me where is Neelu?

2354
02:36:14,040 --> 02:36:14,910
Sorry.

2355
02:36:15,570 --> 02:36:16,950
If you have guts tell me.

2356
02:36:17,030 --> 02:36:20,030
You had come from Amalapuram
to America for me,

2357
02:36:20,520 --> 02:36:22,590
can't you come to me now?

2358
02:36:23,270 --> 02:36:24,310
Try.

2359
02:36:24,390 --> 02:36:25,500
All the best.

2360
02:36:35,230 --> 02:36:37,430
Any news?
- No.

2361
02:36:37,510 --> 02:36:38,660
What to do now?

2362
02:36:50,810 --> 02:36:52,930
Hail Lord Anjaneya!

2363
02:37:41,910 --> 02:37:43,350
Mom whom?

2364
02:37:43,430 --> 02:37:44,810
I may be right down.

2365
02:37:44,890 --> 02:37:47,050
Yes, I love balloons.

2366
02:37:47,680 --> 02:37:49,020
Thank you.

2367
02:37:57,700 --> 02:38:01,010
Hello. Hi!
- Mom my balloons.

2368
02:38:10,390 --> 02:38:12,110
Thank you. Thank you so much.

2369
02:38:12,190 --> 02:38:13,230
Don't cry darling.

2370
02:38:13,310 --> 02:38:15,100
Rascal!
- It's okay. It's alright.

2371
02:38:15,180 --> 02:38:16,900
My balloon.

2372
02:39:52,380 --> 02:39:53,530
Hey stop!

2373
02:39:53,610 --> 02:39:55,750
One step forward... look there.

2374
02:39:59,850 --> 02:40:00,980
Bomb.

2375
02:40:01,190 --> 02:40:03,710
If I press the remote here,
she'll die there.

2376
02:40:07,940 --> 02:40:09,700
Throw him into the lift.
- Okay boss.

2377
02:40:10,160 --> 02:40:11,570
One bomb and two dead bodies.

2378
02:40:11,870 --> 02:40:12,900
I like it.

2379
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:11,000
Sathipandu, just a minute.

2380
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:21,160
Bye.

2381
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:51,020
How much?
- Ten dollars.

2382
02:42:51,190 --> 02:42:52,850
Ten dollars. No.

2383
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:55,100
It's ridiculous. It's too much.

2384
02:43:00,620 --> 02:43:01,650
Okay.

2385
02:43:03,970 --> 02:43:05,880
20 dollars. Thank you.

2386
02:43:06,030 --> 02:43:07,560
Excuse me, sir. Ten dollar.

2387
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:09,060
No keep it with you.
I don't want trouble.

2388
02:43:09,140 --> 02:43:10,880
No please take it your ten dollars.
- Keep the change.

2389
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:12,110
Happy journey.

2390
02:43:12,940 --> 02:43:14,090
Thank you.

2391
02:43:15,070 --> 02:43:16,570
Shake hand man.

2392
02:43:18,520 --> 02:43:19,900
I am very sorry.

2393
02:43:20,390 --> 02:43:22,080
You faced a lot of trouble
because of me.

2394
02:43:22,230 --> 02:43:23,760
Friendship will
take anything, uncle.

2395
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:25,020
You naughty.

2396
02:43:25,190 --> 02:43:27,060
I'll get the car. Bye.

2397
02:43:34,100 --> 02:43:35,120
Bye.

2398
02:43:45,980 --> 02:43:46,870
Go to hell.

2399
02:44:23,010 --> 02:44:24,330
What's this man?
- Sorry, sir.

2400
02:44:24,650 --> 02:44:26,040
You...?
- Sir you...?

2401
02:44:26,120 --> 02:44:27,080
Why are you like this?

2402
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:29,690
I was like a liquor bottle
with customs,

2403
02:44:30,030 --> 02:44:31,670
and a soft drink bottle
with canteen, .

2404
02:44:31,750 --> 02:44:34,270
Now?
- I've become a phenol bottle.

2405
02:44:34,830 --> 02:44:36,310
What lesson have you
learnt from this?

2406
02:44:36,390 --> 02:44:39,390
Whatever you do in life,
bottle is common to all.

2407
02:44:40,150 --> 02:44:41,630
You'll never reform.
- Sir, sir...

2408
02:44:41,710 --> 02:44:43,090
What?
- Any bottle with you?

2409
02:44:43,170 --> 02:44:44,300
I will trash...

2410
02:44:44,690 --> 02:44:45,670
Look, he's here.

2411
02:44:49,100 --> 02:44:50,130
Mother.
- Has thinned down.

2412
02:44:50,210 --> 02:44:51,190
Yes.

2413
02:44:52,680 --> 02:44:53,570
Brother.

2414
02:44:56,920 --> 02:44:57,800
Thank you.

2415
02:44:57,880 --> 02:44:59,430
Are you fine?
- Can't you see?

2416
02:44:59,510 --> 02:45:01,480
Had a happy journey?
- Good.

2417
02:45:02,350 --> 02:45:04,950
Why are you like this?
- I don't like your doing.

2418
02:45:05,030 --> 02:45:05,930
What did I do?

2419
02:45:06,010 --> 02:45:07,490
What did our ancestors told us?
- What did they say?

2420
02:45:07,570 --> 02:45:09,510
They told to love one girl
and marry one girl.

2421
02:45:09,590 --> 02:45:10,430
I did the same thing.

2422
02:45:10,510 --> 02:45:12,480
I loved one girl and
marrying one girl.
