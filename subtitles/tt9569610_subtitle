1
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:18,099
"It could mean nothing,
but everything too."

2
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:21,499
"Such is the uniqueness of paper."

3
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,299
"Floating like boats in the monsoon."

4
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:26,739
"Burning in the flame in the winter."

5
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:29,819
"Soaring in the skies as a kite."

6
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:32,659
"The entire world has
turned bitter enemies over me."

7
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:17,287
What happened?

8
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:19,487
Did you see a nightmare?

9
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:21,327
Not a nightmare.

10
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:26,441
It was some...a kind of premonition.

11
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:30,659
I saw that...you were
kicking *** in the middle of the city.

12
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:37,247
And in that bard suit, you
looked just like Rajesh Khanna(star).

13
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:41,087
Stop dreaming and get real.

14
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:43,407
And the reality is
that I'm Bharat Lal...

15
00:02:43,487 --> 00:02:44,767
...and quite happy with who I am.

16
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,927
'The majority of the
population in our country...'

17
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:53,967
'...are those whom
we call The Common Man.'

18
00:02:54,487 --> 00:03:00,567
'And today I'm going to narrate the
unique story of one such commoner...'

19
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:05,767
'...who lived in Amilo village,
of Azamgarh district in Uttar Pradesh.

20
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:08,127
'And without the
struggles in his life,

21
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:09,967
...he might have continued
to remain a common man.'

22
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:12,687
"Prayer."

23
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:15,767
"Prayer."

24
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:18,287
"Prayer."

25
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:22,247
"Prayer."

26
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,887
I leave no dearth in your service...

27
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:34,807
...while your vessel
wreaks havoc in my shop.

28
00:03:35,393 --> 00:03:36,767
But he's finally landed in the hangar.

29
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:39,527
And this time I'll fix him for good.

30
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,607
- Motiya, Ramphal.
- Yes, brother.

31
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:46,287
Practise '...Mere Mehboob'.

32
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,727
It's top on the radio's
playlist due to public demand.

33
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:49,447
So practice that.

34
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:50,247
Okay.

35
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:52,047
From the top.

36
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:57,207
And, you are coming with me, my love.

37
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:00,887
I have a different
song for you on my mind.

38
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:05,647
"My beloved's arrived..."

39
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:08,407
"O Spring..."

40
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:11,687
Motiya, he's not going to kill him.

41
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:13,727
Just let him go
somewhere far from here.

42
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:15,447
That's his nature.

43
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:24,847
Well, I admit that you're
my Lord Ganesh' personal vessel.

44
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:31,167
But, don't let me catch
you lurking in my shop again.

45
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:36,007
When you gnaw my gear, I lose work.

46
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:38,887
And when you gnaw my uniform,
I lose my reputation.

47
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:40,887
I am letting you go today.

48
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,527
But if I ever catch
you again in my shop...

49
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:44,887
...then, you'll see a different
side of me which you won't like.

50
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:46,087
Understood.

51
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:50,247
Greetings, sir.

52
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:51,847
Out taking care of our mouse troubles.

53
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:53,567
Stop it.

54
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:54,847
Beloved's left.

55
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,847
- Greetings.
- Bless you.

56
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:58,767
- So, how are you?
- Fine.

57
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:00,407
Any new bookings?

58
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:01,927
Yes. On the 27th of this month.

59
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:04,007
At Mr. Radheshyam's place. The guy who's
got a little snack shop at the corner.

60
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:05,487
It's his son's wedding.

61
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:06,927
So be there on the 27th.

62
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:10,727
We've already booked on the 27th.
Isn't that right, Ramphal.

63
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:12,407
Yes. Ganga aunty.
We're already booked.

64
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:16,127
I've said this before.
Why don't you hire more men?

65
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:18,847
So you can take more work.

66
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:22,087
The more work you take,
the more bucks you make.

67
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,127
It's not just the men, sir.

68
00:05:24,287 --> 00:05:26,167
We'll need more instruments, uniforms.

69
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:28,207
More space to practice.

70
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:30,327
You can't fit an elephant on a bus.

71
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:31,727
Ever thought about
expanding the place.

72
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:32,647
Expand?

73
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:34,087
And how do you assume I do that?

74
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:37,567
You don't think money
will rain down from Heaven.

75
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,687
My pocket's completely empty.

76
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,607
Then borrow from the bank.

77
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:42,767
No, never.

78
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:43,767
He's right.

79
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:45,447
Come, Rukmani.

80
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:48,767
Rukmani, I was only advising Bharat
Lal to borrow money from the bank...

81
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:50,247
...so he can expand his shop.

82
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:51,847
I don't want to borrow any money.

83
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:53,927
Borrowing money is
like adopting a dog.

84
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:55,887
They are supposed
to be our protectors...

85
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:58,007
...but, needs to be fed regularly.

86
00:05:58,607 --> 00:05:59,967
And in case you miss
to feed him a single day...

87
00:06:00,047 --> 00:06:01,247
...he'll pounce on you instead.

88
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:02,567
I'm already having mouse troubles...

89
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:04,647
...and, I don't need a dog.

90
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:07,807
Fine. Do whatever you like.
Just be happy.

91
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:08,807
Okay, okay, okay.

92
00:06:08,927 --> 00:06:10,047
See you.

93
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:11,207
Listen...

94
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,447
You know I was thinking...

95
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:16,247
Everyone borrows money from the bank,
so why can't you?

96
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:17,927
And who's going to pay them back.

97
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:19,847
We'll pay them back
with the extra income.

98
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,207
And what if we don't make more money?

99
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,327
It's not like they
will force your hand.

100
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,367
We're not in exactly
in dire straights.

101
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:27,447
And you're scared even
before taking a risk.

102
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:32,167
Rukmini, you're my precious gem.

103
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:34,007
I don't need to borrow any money.

104
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,847
Mr. Srivastav.

105
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:48,927
I heard that the sterilization
camps will soon get lifted.

106
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:52,207
- The Emergency is coming to an end.
- Yeah...

107
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:55,807
Bharat Lal, did they sever
your connection as well?

108
00:06:55,887 --> 00:06:58,607
No, my parts are absolutely intact.

109
00:06:58,927 --> 00:06:59,647
Go on.

110
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:02,087
I am thinking of expanding my shop...

111
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,647
...and looking to borrow money for it.

112
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:04,967
Of course. Of course.

113
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:07,167
I'll get your loan approved.

114
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,567
But what about security?

115
00:07:10,244 --> 00:07:13,287
Well, ...I know Bahadur,
who looks after the entire market...

116
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:14,447
...for a nominal fee.

117
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:16,407
That's not what I meant.

118
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:20,727
The bank needs collateral
for granting you loan.

119
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:21,527
Ahh...

120
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:25,727
Do you have any land or property?

121
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:28,527
Well, the place where
I stay is rented...

122
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,927
...and I've my old shop.

123
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:33,567
No-no...your shop comes under
the Red Tape Property regulations.

124
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:36,007
...and you don't have documents
that prove ownership.

125
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:37,607
Think of something else.

126
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,527
I have an ancestral
property in Khalilabad.

127
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,727
In joint possession
with my aunt and uncle.

128
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:46,207
Great.

129
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:49,127
Then get a copy of
the property documents...

130
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:51,887
...attested by the Record Keeper,
and bring that document to me.

131
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:53,567
And you will get a loan against that.

132
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:54,287
Okay?

133
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:56,047
Okay. See you then.

134
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:56,887
See you.

135
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:57,847
See you.

136
00:07:58,407 --> 00:07:59,447
I'll see you in a week.

137
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:00,647
Sure

138
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:04,847
- Be back soon.
- I will...I will...

139
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:07,687
And, don't be sad if I don't return.

140
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:10,727
Take care and enjoy your life.

141
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:16,487
"Let's go..."

142
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:19,167
"Let's go..."

143
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:27,607
"My home's calling me."

144
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:33,687
"Calling me..."

145
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:36,647
"My home's calling me."

146
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,486
"To the dancing peacocks..."

147
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:42,246
"...and beautiful scenes everywhere."

148
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:50,567
"The place with beautiful
fragrance in the air..."

149
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:53,407
"...and the beautiful streams."

150
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:56,167
"Lamps burning at doorsteps."

151
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:58,687
"And life's filled with happiness."

152
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:04,367
"Let's go..."

153
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:09,607
"The message has come for me."

154
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:13,047
"Let's go..."

155
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:15,967
"My home's calling me."

156
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:18,807
"To the dancing peacocks..."

157
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:21,927
"...and beautiful scenes everywhere."

158
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:31,247
Do you expect me to open the door?

159
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:32,487
I am going.

160
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,727
Coming. Coming.

161
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:44,967
Bharat. After all these years.

162
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:47,727
- Greetings, uncle.
- Bless you, son.

163
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:48,447
Come in.

164
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:51,167
- You're still alive.
- Of course, I am.

165
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:55,967
Are you going to tell me who's
at the door, or is it a secret?

166
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:57,967
It's me, aunty.

167
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,447
Yes, but which 'me'?

168
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:02,927
Bharat.

169
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:04,607
Greetings.

170
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,487
Come, sit.

171
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,647
I am guess you plan to stay overnight.

172
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:14,527
I don't see brother
Hari and Devi around.

173
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:17,127
What are you snooping around for?

174
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:20,887
The baby is crying again.
Go and pacify him.

175
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:21,807
Okay.

176
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:24,047
They went to the city.

177
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,687
And the kids.

178
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:26,727
Them too.

179
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:31,047
Your sister-in-law has
sent these sweetmeats for you.

180
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:33,487
Who is this baby?

181
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:38,367
Meet your nephew, Sushil.
Harilal's son.

182
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:40,647
What a cute kid, Sushil?

183
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:43,047
I will take you home with me someday.

184
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:46,487
And, what about your musical band?

185
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:49,087
It's doing great, thanks to you.

186
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,567
I am looking to expand my business,
and want to borrow money for the same.

187
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:57,927
The bank officials asked me to get a copy
of any property documents that I may have.

188
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,327
So here I am.

189
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,727
Bharat Lal.

190
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:13,767
Finally, my number's up.

191
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
Bharat Lal.

192
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:21,647
Bhure Singh, you?

193
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,647
Sit on the floor.

194
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:25,967
We used to study together in school.

195
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,727
This is a government office.
What is your business here?

196
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:29,807
Nothing much.

197
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:31,647
I want a copy of my
ancestral property papers...

198
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:33,847
...and my uncle said I
should meet the Record Keeper.

199
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,647
And since you're the officer-in-charge,
you will find my paper.

200
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,327
- What is your father's name?
- Kanhaiya Lal.

201
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:41,207
Sorry. That's Late Kanhaiya Lal.

202
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:44,527
And, the teacher would
always send him out of class.

203
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:46,447
For at least one period.

204
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:52,647
Bharat Lal son of Kanhaiya Lal.

205
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:56,807
Village; Salarpur, Post; Khalilabad,
District; Azamgarh.

206
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:58,527
Remember what the
teacher always said...

207
00:11:58,607 --> 00:11:59,767
You're dead.

208
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:06,727
That's not what the teacher said.

209
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:09,607
It says here on paper. You're dead.

210
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,887
Your papers say that I am dead.

211
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:13,767
And what about this living
man in front of you.

212
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:16,967
I don't care.

213
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:17,647
Yea...

214
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:19,327
Official documents never lie.

215
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:21,647
See for yourself.

216
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:26,167
30th July 1976... Sit back down.

217
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:28,327
Bharat Lal passed away.

218
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:32,367
And on his uncle's request, his share of
the land was given to Devi Lal, and...

219
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:33,847
Hari Lal. My brother.

220
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:36,007
Yes, your share's been given to them.

221
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:39,447
No, this is wrong.
This is completely wrong.

222
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,927
How can it be wrong?

223
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:44,687
It's all here on official documents.

224
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:45,927
Who's more honest,
that piece of paper or me?

225
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:47,687
Don't forget this
is a government office...

226
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,927
...and we only believe what's
written on legal documents.

227
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:50,687
I see...

228
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:53,487
So that register has more
importance than humans beings.

229
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,967
A piece of paper is
more valued than my word.

230
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:57,367
Why are you screaming?

231
00:12:57,447 --> 00:12:59,127
I am not screaming...

232
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:00,847
...I just lost my cool
in a state of shock.

233
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:02,847
I am right in front of you.

234
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:04,767
Hey you, hit me.

235
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,647
See...

236
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:09,767
I am not denying that.

237
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:11,567
Then make the correction in the paper.

238
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:15,087
And be sent to jail along with you
for tampering with legal documents.

239
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,287
But why me?

240
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:17,967
- For forgery.
- Why?

241
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:23,087
For trying to usurp
a dead man's property.

242
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,967
- It has legal repercussions.
- Fantastic.

243
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:27,047
You mean to say I am trying
to usurp my own property.

244
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:28,607
It's like the pot
calling the kettle black.

245
00:13:29,047 --> 00:13:29,927
Who are you calling black?

246
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:31,047
It's a popular saying.

247
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:32,287
I know one too.

248
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:33,007
Please.

249
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:34,807
A rude man doesn't
understand politeness.

250
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:36,967
And you're a classic example of that.

251
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:38,527
- Constable, take him away.
- Come on.

252
00:13:38,607 --> 00:13:41,007
- Don't touch me.
- Take him away.

253
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,487
Throw him out.

254
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:43,367
His words mean nothing.

255
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,327
He used to pee in his pants.

256
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,927
Outing my secrets.

257
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:49,727
You're not even fit to be a watchman.
Let alone a record keeper.

258
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:51,047
Go bring your uncle.

259
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:52,567
I'll go get my uncle.

260
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:55,487
Blaming my uncle for this.

261
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:58,287
How dare you insult the officer?

262
00:13:58,687 --> 00:14:00,647
- Beat him.
- My cycle...

263
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:01,727
Get out.

264
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:11,447
Listen...Hari.

265
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,687
That no good Bharat
is coming this way.

266
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,807
I think he knows.

267
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:18,487
No need to worry, mother.

268
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:19,607
If he tries to be a wise guy...

269
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:21,207
...we will teach him a lesson.

270
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:24,207
Uncle.

271
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:25,807
Uncle.

272
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:27,727
Aunty...

273
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:31,167
What happened?
Why come back here again?

274
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:34,407
Did you leave something behind?

275
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:38,007
That bloody record keeper Bhurelal...

276
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:41,887
...claims that you had
me declared officially dead.

277
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,847
Rascal. He wants to
create a rift in our family.

278
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:46,567
He's telling the truth.

279
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:52,899
- Listen...
- Yeah...

280
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:54,487
- Tell him.
- Of course.

281
00:14:54,767 --> 00:15:00,807
Look here Bharat Lal,
you're my elder brother's only son.

282
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:02,407
Whereas I have three.

283
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:05,007
So you got your entire lion share...

284
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:08,207
...whereas my sons got peanuts.

285
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:11,487
Later, when your father
fell sick and passed away...

286
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:13,327
...your mother took you with her.

287
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,487
Back to her home.

288
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:22,847
Which is why we officially
declared you dead.

289
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:27,967
And distributed your share
of the property amongst my children.

290
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:30,317
Nothing more, son.

291
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,127
Nothing more.

292
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,007
And let me make one thing very clear.

293
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:40,127
We are no longer your relatives, nor
do we have any business left with you.

294
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,087
Now get lost.

295
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:45,127
Why are you still
listening to the radio?

296
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:46,327
Get back inside.

297
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:50,167
What he's trying to say is...

298
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:57,167
...there's nothing wrong in
killing a man who is officially dead.

299
00:15:57,887 --> 00:15:58,927
Come on.

300
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:00,647
This way.

301
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,367
Get lost or we'll show you.

302
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:04,727
Get lost.

303
00:16:05,807 --> 00:16:06,727
Get lost.

304
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:07,567
Get lost.

305
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:08,527
And don't you come back here.

306
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:11,007
You spoiled our family's reputation.

307
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:12,207
I will show you.

308
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,727
Get lost.

309
00:16:24,327 --> 00:16:25,447
What happened?

310
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:29,967
Ram's name is true.

311
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:32,407
Ram's name is true.

312
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:40,007
Rukmini. I am dead.

313
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:56,287
Brother Bharat, who died?

314
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,367
I did.

315
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:03,167
Sit.

316
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,087
Bless you.

317
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:07,646
What's wrong, Bharat Lal?

318
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,847
- Tell me in detail.
- What to say, sir.

319
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:11,007
Tea.

320
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:15,247
Son, I wish you had
brought some snacks as well.

321
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:17,166
Just to make the
story more interesting.

322
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:20,406
- I'll get it.
- Yes.

323
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:23,007
- Chaman..
- Yeah...

324
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:26,847
Serve this tea to all
those who didn't laugh.

325
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:28,527
Brother.

326
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:30,327
What am I hearing, brother?

327
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:33,447
I wasn't there with you, or else
I would've moved heaven and earth.

328
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:35,447
But how did it happen
in the first place?

329
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:36,927
It's nothing.

330
00:17:37,007 --> 00:17:40,487
- I went to borrow money in order to...
- Brother.

331
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:43,087
I heard you've been
officially declared dead.

332
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,007
Yes, I am.

333
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:45,087
On papers...

334
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:46,687
Not to worry, brother Bharat.

335
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:48,607
Go see Inu baba...

336
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:50,447
...and offer him liquor.

337
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,047
He'll gently kiss you on the head...

338
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:55,287
...and all your
problems will disappear.

339
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,167
Gendwa Baba has no powers.

340
00:17:58,405 --> 00:17:59,727
He's an imposter.

341
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:01,807
Gendwa is an imposter.

342
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:05,607
You know there's a
shrine on the outskirts.

343
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:07,047
Go to his shrine...

344
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:08,207
...and you'll find
a saint sitting there.

345
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,927
He smacks you thrice on the head.

346
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:11,687
And fortune shines on him.

347
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,007
That's true, brother.

348
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:14,607
That's how he cured his piles.

349
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:16,407
Why you...

350
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:18,007
Isn't that the truth?

351
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:19,567
Are you trying to tease me?

352
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:21,447
Wasn't your piles cured.

353
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:23,927
- I am the one whose dead.
- Trying to be a wise guy, huh.

354
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:29,807
Rampal, I am only dead on papers.

355
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:31,807
These are fake flowers.

356
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:36,127
Oh, God...

357
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:37,567
Get lost.

358
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:39,407
Curse you bloody...

359
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:40,407
Make way.

360
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:41,967
Where are you going?

361
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:43,647
I'm going out...

362
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:45,607
I am tired of answering
their questions.

363
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:47,327
Just serve tea to
whoever shows up now.

364
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:49,607
Priest, you know how I died.

365
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:51,007
- Yes.
- So tell them as well...

366
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:52,607
Bloody...

367
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:54,047
Will you look at that?

368
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:57,247
He just died recently,
and now he's walking away.

369
00:18:57,327 --> 00:18:59,167
Drive carefully.

370
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:01,527
Nonsense.

371
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,927
A dead man should have patience.

372
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,127
Useless kids.

373
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:11,367
You're absolutely right.

374
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:13,367
You should watch films too.

375
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:15,887
- I have. I have.
- Chander.

376
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:18,567
A cup of tea, and put it on my tab.

377
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:21,607
What's wrong?

378
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:23,407
Why did you get up?
Am I an untouchable?

379
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:24,287
No, you're a ghost.

380
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:32,127
Brother Bharat,
please settle the account.

381
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:36,607
You see...I don't want my money
also going to the grave with you.

382
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:41,207
- How many spoons of sugar?
- Two. What's wrong?

383
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:42,447
Add one more.

384
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:45,087
Not sugar. Poison.

385
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:48,407
You think it's funny, huh...

386
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:54,367
Useless.

387
00:19:54,687 --> 00:19:55,287
What's wrong?

388
00:19:57,221 --> 00:19:58,522
Ghost uncle.

389
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:03,167
Uncle, will you play the
ghost in the RamLeela?

390
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:04,567
Ghost uncle.

391
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:05,887
How dare you...

392
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:07,007
I'll beat you.

393
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:08,047
Take that.

394
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,927
Get lost.

395
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,807
Hey...

396
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:14,687
How dare you deflate the tire?

397
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:16,967
I won't spare any of you.

398
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:21,226
Get lost. Get lost.

399
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:22,887
Get lost.

400
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:27,892
Run away.

401
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:33,347
Run away.

402
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:42,889
Ghost.

403
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:53,129
Stop staring like an owl.

404
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,529
Get some rest.

405
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:57,889
What rest?

406
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,769
I can't get it out of my head.

407
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:05,449
Even the neighbourhood kids
tease me now calling me 'Ghost uncle'.

408
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:07,569
Even deflated my cycle's tire.

409
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:13,449
Can I say something?

410
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:14,129
Yes.

411
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:16,289
The thought scares me too...

412
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:19,169
...when I wonder whether I am
sleeping with a man or a ghost.

413
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:20,169
I see...you think its funny.

414
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:22,489
I'll show you whether
I am a ghost or not.

415
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,129
Today is Tuesday.

416
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,529
Tuesday.
Oh, God. Forgive me. Forgive me.

417
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:36,889
'Bharat Lal was tired of becoming
the butt of all jokes in his village.'

418
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:43,619
And finally decided to meet the
village-chief to seek his help.

419
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:46,379
Fantastic.

420
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:49,179
Someone call the dancer.

421
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:54,139
Ladies and Gentlemen...

422
00:21:54,219 --> 00:22:00,139
...we thank Shukla Gas Agency, for giving
our band a chance to sing in this program.

423
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:01,619
I do... I do...

424
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:05,739
And now presenting...red
beauty like the flower of fire.

425
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:07,019
"My handsome beloved..."

426
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:08,099
"...strong as a mountain."

427
00:22:08,219 --> 00:22:10,299
"I cannot control myself around him."

428
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:12,459
"Peeking from the
windows and parapets..."

429
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,419
"...trying to cast a spell on him."

430
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,779
"My beloved's so fearless..."

431
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:16,939
"...even his competition fears him."

432
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:18,859
"Women just lay their
heart in his way."

433
00:22:18,939 --> 00:22:20,539
"Keep him close, keep him safe..."

434
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:22,899
"...or someone might swoop him away."

435
00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:26,859
"Red like the flower of fire."

436
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:31,339
"My beloved rules every heart."

437
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:33,859
"Red like the flower of fire."

438
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:36,179
"My beloved rules every heart."

439
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:40,459
"Don't let him out of the house until
I haven't warded every evil eye."

440
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:42,299
"Beloved..."

441
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:44,579
"Beloved..."

442
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:49,139
"O beloved, every man-stealer
out there, wants to make you theirs.

443
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:53,619
"O beloved, every man-stealer
out there, wants to make you theirs.

444
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:57,939
"O beloved, every man-stealer
out there, wants to make you theirs.

445
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:03,219
"O beloved, every man-stealer
out there, wants to make you theirs.

446
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:24,299
"Beloved sturdy like a glass..."

447
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:26,459
"...and talks first class."

448
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,579
"...and talks first class."

449
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,779
"Beloved sturdy like a glass..."

450
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:33,019
"...and talks first class."

451
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:37,659
"Every word he says...is
coated with sugar."

452
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:39,699
"...is coated with sugar."

453
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:41,819
"Beloved's so romantic..."

454
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:44,019
"...he looks like a poet in a suit."

455
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:46,179
"Beloved's so romantic..."

456
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,379
"...he looks like a poet in a suit."

457
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:52,819
"Don't let him out of the house until
I haven't warded every evil eye."

458
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,539
"Beloved..."

459
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:57,099
"Beloved..."

460
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:01,539
"O beloved, every man-stealer
out there, wants to make you theirs.

461
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:06,019
"O beloved, every man-stealer
out there, wants to make you theirs.

462
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:10,339
"O beloved, every man-stealer
out there, wants to make you theirs.

463
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:12,539
Watch where you're shooting?

464
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,099
I've just started this gas agency...

465
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:15,299
- ...so don't start a fire on the first day.
- Hello, sir.

466
00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:16,499
- Bharat Lal.
- Yes.

467
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:19,339
- How are you?
- Not well I am afraid.

468
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:20,219
I see...

469
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:23,299
- Come on, let's pee.
- But I don't want to.

470
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:29,139
Just a little... You will feel better.

471
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,659
"My beloved’s fragrance..."

472
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:34,459
What do you want?

473
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,619
And make it quick.

474
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:38,499
I have no words to
describe my problems.

475
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:40,659
My life is in complete turmoil.

476
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:42,259
"Beloved..."

477
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:46,939
"Everyone listens to my beloved."

478
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:53,579
Spoken according to your size.

479
00:24:57,339 --> 00:25:03,739
You see, tomorrow I'll make an official
document with my signature on it...

480
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:07,059
...claiming that Bharat
Lal is still alive.

481
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:10,699
"Angry now, then gets romantic."

482
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:12,259
Okay, thank you very much.

483
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:14,899
Where are you going?

484
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:19,139
Come and dance with that female.

485
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:23,739
Otherwise, people will say
that Bharat Lal is really dead.

486
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:30,179
"O beloved, every man-stealer
out there, wants to make you theirs.

487
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:34,539
"O beloved, every man-stealer
out there, wants to make you theirs.

488
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:39,579
"O beloved, every man-stealer
out there, wants to make you theirs.

489
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:45,259
I had too much of it last night.

490
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:46,859
You're absolutely right, sir.

491
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:51,699
I never saw you eat bread
dipped in alcohol before.

492
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:54,139
Don't talk nonsense, stupid.

493
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:56,859
It's not the liquor...

494
00:25:58,219 --> 00:25:59,939
I was talking about gas.

495
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:05,979
Sir, I think you're nothing short of a
cylinder yourself when it comes to gas.

496
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:10,219
God was indicating you to open
a gas agency for a long time.

497
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:14,579
You are funny.

498
00:26:16,102 --> 00:26:17,779
Hello, sir.

499
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:23,619
- Who is that?
- Bharat Lal.

500
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:25,459
Bharat Lal?

501
00:26:25,899 --> 00:26:27,899
Oh yes, Bharat Lal.

502
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:29,699
What brings you here
at this early hour?

503
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:34,419
Give me that certificate you promised
stating that I am still alive.

504
00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:35,619
Who me?

505
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:38,259
That's not possible.

506
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:40,059
But last night you said you'll do it.

507
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:41,259
You assured me.

508
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:42,419
Maybe...

509
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:43,499
Answer me this...

510
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:47,579
If Lord Shiva kills someone, can
Lord Brahma bring him back to life?

511
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:51,979
When the Record keeper has
declared you are dead...

512
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:54,619
...then what does that make me?

513
00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:56,939
How can I bring you back to life? No.

514
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:59,619
But what about your word?

515
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:06,019
Well, I make so many promises in a day,
it's hard to remember which ones I made.

516
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:09,539
And anyway, I was drunk.

517
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:11,059
Listen.

518
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:17,299
In our country, the Record keeper is
more important than the Governor.

519
00:27:17,379 --> 00:27:18,299
Understood.

520
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:20,859
If he says you're a camel...

521
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:25,539
...then it will take you a lifetime
to prove that you're not a camel.

522
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:30,579
'After being turned
down by the village chief...'

523
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:35,619
'...a disappointed Bharat Lal turned
to what we call 'The system' for help.'

524
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,899
And thus began the
relay of applications.

525
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:45,068
"Respected..."

526
00:27:45,648 --> 00:27:48,859
"...Mr. Collector."

527
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:56,059
"I want to bring
to your notice that..."

528
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:58,179
The Record keeper has killed me.

529
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,179
That's no way to write a letter.

530
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,419
Allow me.

531
00:28:02,499 --> 00:28:04,579
"I would like to bring
to your kind notice..."

532
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:09,259
I Bharat Lal, son of Kanhaiya Lal
have been declared dead...

533
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:21,019
"Thanking you."

534
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,379
"Yours..."

535
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:23,699
Bharat Lal?

536
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:26,699
"...applicant, Bharat Lal."

537
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:28,459
Here you go.

538
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:30,299
Just sign here.

539
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,379
- Will this do the job.
- Of course.

540
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:36,980
And if this doesn't work, then
we'll write another one to his father.

541
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:38,219
Father?

542
00:28:38,379 --> 00:28:40,259
- The senior officer.
- I see...

543
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:42,059
You mean the District Collector.

544
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:43,459
And, what if he doesn't reply either?

545
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:44,659
Then we'll write to
the even higher authority.

546
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:49,819
- You mean DM, CM, PM...
- Yes, all of the above.

547
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:51,299
Fine. I'll write them all for you.

548
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:52,059
Yes.

549
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:56,579
Move. Move.

550
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:58,339
Rukmani.

551
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,499
Rukmani.

552
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:07,179
Where is your mother?

553
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:08,459
Rukmani.

554
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:10,979
Rukmani.

555
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:12,579
What happened?

556
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:14,344
Come here.

557
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:15,419
Careful.

558
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:16,539
Listen.

559
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:19,579
I finally received a reply.

560
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:25,179
The Prime Minister has assured me that the
Record Keeper will take necessary action.

561
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,779
- You're so naive.
- And you're my wife.

562
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:30,939
Let me go.

563
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:34,899
Always making fun.

564
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:46,099
Another letter, another reply.

565
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:50,739
First, you wrote to
the Collector.

566
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:52,619
And he told you to
meet with the Record Keeper.

567
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,019
Then you wrote to
the District Collector.

568
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,019
And even he said to
meet with the Record Keeper.

569
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:01,379
Then to the
Governor, Minister, Chief Minister.

570
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:07,459
You wrote to all of them. And they all
said to meet with the Record Keeper.

571
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:10,219
And now the Prime Minister.

572
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,659
I am sure he wrote the same reply.

573
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:17,499
Meaning another paper in this bunch.

574
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:23,419
How long did it take
to send him this reply?

575
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:27,979
Three?

576
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:28,859
Four!

577
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,819
When did you last take up any work?

578
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:34,659
Four.

579
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:36,179
Six...

580
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:39,339
How long have I been pregnant?

581
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:44,139
Seven... Eight.

582
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:45,099
Seven.

583
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:47,979
That's what I was saying. Seven...

584
00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:49,019
You know what?

585
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:52,939
You've no idea how hungry
a woman feels when she is pregnant.

586
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:58,299
Do you have any clue how
I've been arranging for these meals?

587
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:02,699
Sometimes I work as a
daily wager making pickles.

588
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:04,579
Sometimes I borrow it.

589
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:08,939
But you don't know.

590
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:13,219
I do, Rukmani.

591
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:26,939
Don't be scared. She has a nice heart.

592
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:27,899
What are you doing?

593
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:29,179
If you yell at me like this...

594
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:31,819
...she will feel that
you're a cruel mother.

595
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,579
Listen, just be on time...

596
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:38,419
...and we will fix her together.

597
00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:42,299
And you have a brother,
he's on the terrace drying up.

598
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:56,659
- What happened?
- Hear.

599
00:33:56,899 --> 00:33:58,699
"The midwife's happy and galore..."

600
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:00,699
"...because its a daughter."

601
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:03,539
Play aloud.

602
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:08,699
Congratulations.

603
00:34:10,779 --> 00:34:13,659
Congratulations.

604
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:18,819
Imerti.

605
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,699
Are all her parts okay?

606
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:22,899
She's hale and healthy.

607
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,018
But she is crying a lot.

608
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:29,859
She is crying but
she's absolutely fine.

609
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:32,579
Because her father is dead on paper.

610
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:34,458
So the daughter is mourning.

611
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:35,938
Right...

612
00:34:36,018 --> 00:34:38,498
What will she write as the
name of her father. Late Bharat Lal.

613
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:41,219
What will she write
her father's name in school.

614
00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:43,978
Who will get her married?

615
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,299
Come here, my dear.

616
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:51,498
Come on.

617
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:55,978
I am Bharat Lal. Your father.

618
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,059
Alive.

619
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,579
Evidence.

620
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:02,899
You are so delicate.

621
00:35:02,979 --> 00:35:06,539
You can't even squat a fly.

622
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:08,859
The Lord works
in such mysterious ways.

623
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:12,619
He sent you in this cruel world,
as my responsibility.

624
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:19,699
Lord...your faith is unmatched.

625
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:24,499
Since he's made you
my responsibility...

626
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:30,259
...then even I swear that I shall
give you the respect, the honour,

627
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:33,739
and the privilege that you deserve.

628
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:41,619
A piece of paper has no power
to take your father away from you.

629
00:35:44,419 --> 00:35:47,779
'In the battle between truth and lies,
truth always triumphs.'

630
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:50,259
'But the sad truth
about our country is...'

631
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:53,819
'...success only comes to
those who have proper papers.'

632
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:56,779
'That's the importance
of paper in our system.'

633
00:35:57,139 --> 00:36:01,019
'And challenging this
power is not an ordinary task...'

634
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:03,259
'...nor the job of an ordinary man.'

635
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:11,579
But Bharat Lal confronted the paper,
the system, and me.

636
00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:13,259
I had found a new target...

637
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:15,579
...and I thought I'll lure him in.

638
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:17,539
Here you go. Take this offering.

639
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:18,619
Offering?

640
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:20,139
It's from Paltan Baba.

641
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,539
Pay obeisance and have it

642
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:24,939
Never heard of it.

643
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:26,539
His original name was Paltan Yadav.

644
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:29,739
Even he was declared dead on papers,
like you.

645
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:30,619
I see...

646
00:36:30,699 --> 00:36:33,139
He got tired of fighting the case...

647
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:34,859
...and lost all attachment
with this world.

648
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:37,259
Actually, he had no money left.

649
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:39,019
And turned into a saint instead.

650
00:36:39,259 --> 00:36:40,899
Now, whenever he comes
down for a hearing...

651
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:42,339
...this is how he pays his fee.

652
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:43,579
Sugar Lumps.

653
00:36:43,899 --> 00:36:45,699
So he had a hearing today.

654
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:49,099
I would've introduced you
two today if you had arrived earlier.

655
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:50,859
Let me show you another sample.

656
00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:51,859
I see...

657
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:52,779
Come with me.

658
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:58,419
- How are you Pitamah?
- Fine, sir.

659
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:01,299
- Are you dead or alive?
- Dead.

660
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:06,899
- Are the bullets real or fake?
- They are real, but not for using them.

661
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:08,939
Have you heard about Bhisam Singh?

662
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:13,059
Yes, ...he was a popular dacoit.
Committed countless murders...

663
00:37:13,379 --> 00:37:14,899
That's him.

664
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:16,179
- Him?
- Yes.

665
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:20,019
When the government gave a
chance to the dacoits to surrender...

666
00:37:20,379 --> 00:37:22,139
...he was the first
to lay his weapons.

667
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:25,139
And swore never to
resort to violence again.

668
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:28,339
Years later when he was released from
jail and returned to his village...

669
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:30,499
...and thought he'll
work in his field.

670
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:35,699
Only to find out that his
brothers have usurped his land...

671
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:38,859
...and declared him dead on papers.

672
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:43,899
He could have killed each one of them.

673
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:46,299
But no, he had taken an oath.

674
00:37:46,939 --> 00:37:48,619
He had turned into a good man.

675
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:54,259
And like a good citizen,
he decided to fight a legal battle.

676
00:37:55,979 --> 00:38:00,379
He's been regularly coming here
for 22 years only to prove he's alive.

677
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:02,019
But to no avail.

678
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,259
And even he's proved alive now...

679
00:38:04,379 --> 00:38:05,699
...he doesn't have too long.

680
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:09,699
Do you understand?

681
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:14,459
- What did you say the name was?
- Pitamah.

682
00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:18,419
- Not him, yours.
- Bharat Lal, Band Master.

683
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:21,459
Bharat Lal.

684
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:24,499
These are just two examples.

685
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:26,659
There are many more.

686
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:28,859
Take my advice, what's done is done.

687
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:30,139
Forgive and forget.

688
00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:33,939
How can I forget it?
How can I admit that I am alive?

689
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:36,659
Do you see this compound?

690
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:38,739
It's filled with people.

691
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:41,459
From peons to clerks,
you'll have to grease every palm.

692
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,179
Only then will your job get done.

693
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,339
Do you have that kind of money?

694
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:49,859
I don't,
but I'll come up with something.

695
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,659
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

696
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:52,819
- Sure.
- Yes.

697
00:38:52,899 --> 00:38:55,099
Fine...then let's open
an account right now.

698
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:55,939
Where?

699
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:57,139
Kevat Bank.

700
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:01,539
So, 125 rupees for
the form and stamp paper...

701
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,459
...and 100 rupees to get
the job done at lightning speed.

702
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:07,979
But I have only 190 rupees.

703
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:11,139
Doesn't matter. These will do.

704
00:39:11,419 --> 00:39:16,139
You know what, I'll fill up
your form in Hindi instead of English.

705
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:17,179
That will be cheaper.

706
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:19,059
Yes, give me a cheaper option.

707
00:39:19,379 --> 00:39:23,299
Since you've taken my refuge,
I'll definitely do something.

708
00:39:23,379 --> 00:39:24,099
Okay.

709
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:25,419
- Greetings.
- Okay.

710
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:28,899
- Are you from Ayodhya.
- You can say that.

711
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:29,899
Okay.

712
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:30,779
Uncle.

713
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:31,699
Yes.

714
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:33,619
See you, I am leaving for now.

715
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:35,939
I've spoken with Sadhu sir,
so see you later.

716
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:36,979
Okay.

717
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:39,419
And, I'll ask Rukmani
to send some food for you too.

718
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:40,499
Okay.

719
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:41,539
Reserve some space for me too.

720
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:43,659
I have a place for you in my heart.

721
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:54,779
- Here you go.
- Gupta.

722
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,419
Here's your money in full.

723
00:39:57,499 --> 00:39:59,059
That settles the past account.

724
00:39:59,259 --> 00:40:01,459
And don't ever serve
me vegetarian food again.

725
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,299
- I won't.
- Now send some mutton curry for me.

726
00:40:03,419 --> 00:40:04,339
Okay, sir.

727
00:40:04,579 --> 00:40:07,979
Chotu. Bring some mutton
curry for Sadhuram.

728
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:09,899
He's found a scapegoat.

729
00:40:09,979 --> 00:40:10,899
Okay.

730
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:14,530
You're unbelievable.
Found a scapegoat.

731
00:40:15,755 --> 00:40:18,355
Someone's looking really happy.

732
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:21,075
Look at this.

733
00:40:21,435 --> 00:40:23,675
Benarasi Sari. What's the occasion?

734
00:40:23,795 --> 00:40:25,835
I met with a lawyer today.

735
00:40:25,915 --> 00:40:27,915
Sadhuram Kevat LLB.

736
00:40:28,275 --> 00:40:31,035
He's an expert on cases like mine.

737
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:33,115
And promised he will solve my troubles.

738
00:40:33,195 --> 00:40:34,235
- Really?
- Yes.

739
00:40:34,355 --> 00:40:37,875
Listen, what day is it today?
Not Tuesday, is it?

740
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:41,435
- No. It's on Monday.
- Then how about it?

741
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:51,235
Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit.

742
00:41:04,284 --> 00:41:07,079
"You and I are a
match made in heaven..."

743
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:10,159
"...let's together fly to the moon."

744
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,639
"You and I are a
match made in heaven..."

745
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:21,399
"...let's together fly to the moon."

746
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,319
"We'll stare into each other's eyes..."

747
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,279
"...and talk about sweet nothings."

748
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,079
"We'll stare into each other's eyes..."

749
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,199
"...and talk about sweet nothings."

750
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:50,119
"If you come closer, then so will I."

751
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:55,519
"And feel your
breath...mingle with mine."

752
00:41:56,277 --> 00:42:01,359
"The feelings in my
heart...I'll convey it to you."

753
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,919
"Honestly...I won't hide anything."

754
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,559
"I'll forsake the world
and lose myself in you."

755
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:16,159
"Never come back."

756
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:18,999
"Never again."

757
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,839
"Faster...faster..."

758
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:24,879
"...let's fly faster to the moon."

759
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,959
"Because my heart's
already racing ahead of me."

760
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:29,559
Just tell me your demands
and get this over with.

761
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:31,239
Stop bothering me. I won't do it

762
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:32,919
Just do as I say.

763
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:34,439
And don't worry.

764
00:42:56,919 --> 00:42:58,919
"When I'll look at you..."

765
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:02,239
"...I won't take my eyes off you."

766
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:07,599
"And spend every day together."

767
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:13,759
"I'll take you amongst
beautiful flowers."

768
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,999
"And show you the world of fragrances."

769
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:25,479
"We'll hold hands
and never stop working.

770
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:28,519
"Never come back."

771
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:31,039
"Never again."

772
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,439
"I feel overwhelmed..."

773
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:33,959
"I feel overwhelmed..."

774
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,839
"I feel overwhelmed..."

775
00:43:36,919 --> 00:43:39,719
"I feel overwhelmed
hearing what you said."

776
00:43:39,799 --> 00:43:42,759
"And now even I am prepared."

777
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:55,239
'Caught in this never-ending
quagmire of courts...'

778
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:57,999
'...Bharat Lal had
lost everything he had.'

779
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:02,759
'Along with Rukmani's dreams
of Bharat Lal forming a bigger band.'

780
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:06,879
Sorry, no luck this time.

781
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:10,479
You won't find any more
tasty dresses to chew on.

782
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:15,439
Here you go, Bharat Lal. Count it.

783
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,239
No need.

784
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:19,519
Wait a minute.

785
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,839
Thakur sir, can I keep this?

786
00:44:22,919 --> 00:44:24,799
He's been my companion
through thick and thin.

787
00:44:24,879 --> 00:44:25,879
Of course, you can keep it.

788
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:27,839
And anyway, I am going to
give all this away in the junk.

789
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:32,359
Come on. Hurry up, man.

790
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:33,199
Get going.

791
00:45:19,879 --> 00:45:21,679
What's wrong?

792
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:25,799
Why are you sad?

793
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:32,599
Did Sadhuram ask for money again?

794
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:41,039
All the money's gone
within a couple of months.

795
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,799
Stop fighting this battle.

796
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,599
Sadhuram has said he's trying.
He's thought of something.

797
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:56,239
And you want me to quit this battle.

798
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,079
I can't see you in pain like this.

799
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:09,759
You are alive and in front of me.

800
00:46:10,919 --> 00:46:12,439
And I am happy.

801
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:15,319
Forget all this.

802
00:46:16,439 --> 00:46:18,799
And think of a way to make a living.

803
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:26,799
I'll do something.

804
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,359
When LLB wasn't much help...

805
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:48,519
He decided to make
the new MLA aware of his struggles.

806
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:55,879
'Bharat Lal's vote had contributed
in Asharfi Devi's victory.'

807
00:46:56,196 --> 00:46:59,559
This isn't our victory alone,
but yours too.

808
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:01,027
It's this country's men.

809
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:02,519
And for our countrymen.

810
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:05,439
Asharfi Devi. She is a black sheep...

811
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:07,359
...in the herd of Politicians.

812
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,239
Her father was a well-known Land Lord...

813
00:47:10,638 --> 00:47:13,279
...maybe that's why
she was called Asharfi.

814
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,839
She always listens to her conscience,
rather than sycophants.

815
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,479
Even though she was
an independent candidate...

816
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:21,919
...she won the elections
and the heart of the people.

817
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:24,679
We are very grateful...

818
00:47:24,799 --> 00:47:27,759
- Glory to...
- Asharfi Devi.

819
00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:29,959
Asharfi Devi...

820
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:31,599
Who is that on the road?

821
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:32,919
Come on.

822
00:47:32,999 --> 00:47:35,159
- Glory to...
- Asharfi Devi.

823
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:37,239
- Pablo, give me the camera.
- Yeah, Sonia.

824
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:40,279
- Glory to...
- Asharfi Devi.

825
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,839
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

826
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,839
- I am very sorry, ma'am.
- I know.

827
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:14,479
I read it in the morning.

828
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,319
I don't know how it happened.

829
00:48:16,399 --> 00:48:18,279
- Hello. How are you?
- How this picture got published.

830
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:21,039
Please be seated
and I'll be right back.

831
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:24,279
These reporters cannot
be trusted any longer.

832
00:48:24,439 --> 00:48:27,919
I haven't the slightest clue
why this man wants to be alive.

833
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:30,639
You are my PR.
If you don't know then who will.

834
00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:33,679
I don't know how this
picture got published.

835
00:48:33,759 --> 00:48:34,959
Very sorry.

836
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:37,519
Well, at least the rally
did some good for someone.

837
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,479
I've informed the editor in Lucknow.

838
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,159
But who is this rebellious gentleman?

839
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,159
Find out his name.

840
00:48:44,759 --> 00:48:46,919
Wait a second.

841
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:49,479
Wait a second. Excuse me.

842
00:48:49,959 --> 00:48:51,439
Where can I find Mr. Bharat Lal?

843
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:53,799
- Take the next left.
- That way.

844
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:57,119
Hello. Is Mr. Bharat Lal at home?

845
00:48:57,479 --> 00:48:58,519
And who are you?

846
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:00,319
I am Sonia, and I am a reporter.

847
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:02,559
I wrote this article.

848
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,959
Yes, ...he's getting
a shave at the barbershop.

849
00:49:06,439 --> 00:49:08,319
Okay. Take a picture.

850
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:10,239
No, don't.

851
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,199
I don't want any pictures taken.

852
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:18,079
Kallu, don't forget to rub
alum on his face after the shave.

853
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:20,519
Why? Do we have a booking for a wedding?

854
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:22,239
A beautiful girl is
asking around for you...

855
00:49:22,479 --> 00:49:24,759
With your picture in the newspaper...

856
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:26,519
Look, there she is.

857
00:49:26,999 --> 00:49:28,479
Hello, Mr. Bharat Lal.

858
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,119
I am Sonia. We wanted to talk..

859
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,239
Listen...

860
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:36,439
Don't you have a holiday today?
Go and celebrate.

861
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:38,519
Bharat Lal listen...

862
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:41,519
I told you let's not
do the interview on Holi.

863
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,559
Be quiet. Catch him.

864
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:48,719
Bharat Lal listen.

865
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:51,279
Is he Bharat Lal or Natwarlal.

866
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,879
Pablo, this is no time to joke.

867
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,319
We only want 5 minutes of your time.

868
00:49:57,399 --> 00:49:58,639
Listen to me.

869
00:49:59,439 --> 00:50:00,919
Oh...God...

870
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,079
Bharat Lal...

871
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:03,799
Oh...

872
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:06,119
Why are you after me?

873
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,399
Mr. Bharat Lal, I am a reporter.

874
00:50:08,479 --> 00:50:09,839
And we've been running because of you.

875
00:50:09,999 --> 00:50:11,319
I don't want to give an interview...

876
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:13,199
No pictures either.

877
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:14,199
Yes...

878
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:18,079
I want people to know about your story.

879
00:50:19,399 --> 00:50:22,119
That's exactly why I don't
want to give an interview.

880
00:50:23,399 --> 00:50:25,919
I've already become a
laughing stock in the village.

881
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,679
And post this interview I will become
a laughing stock all over the country.

882
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,679
And I want to help you.

883
00:50:30,759 --> 00:50:32,799
Why do you want to help me?

884
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:41,679
Well because I don't just
understand your pain and sorrow...

885
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,879
...but I can feel them as well.

886
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:48,679
She is right.

887
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:50,719
Trust us, Mr. Bharat Lal.

888
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:55,759
We won't print a single
word without your permission.

889
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:56,919
Promise.

890
00:50:57,879 --> 00:50:58,719
Okay.

891
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:04,479
I feel you're a good man...and woman.

892
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,079
I trust you.

893
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:08,879
But I have a small request.

894
00:51:08,959 --> 00:51:11,359
It should be an article and not a joke.

895
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,199
Yes.

896
00:51:22,919 --> 00:51:25,639
So you're the one who unleashed
this ghost of the monarchy.

897
00:51:27,279 --> 00:51:30,759
Ma'am, this is your constituency.
You should do something.

898
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:31,919
Of course.

899
00:51:31,999 --> 00:51:34,159
- We must make this man come alive again.
- Of course.

900
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:35,279
We must do it.

901
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:36,999
Sadhuram.

902
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:38,999
Will the newspaper do any good?

903
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:40,039
Let's forget about good and bad...

904
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:41,879
- ...and come with me right now.
- Where?

905
00:51:41,959 --> 00:51:42,879
For the funeral.

906
00:51:42,959 --> 00:51:44,239
Remember that gentleman
I introduced you to.

907
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:44,839
Yes.

908
00:51:44,919 --> 00:51:46,679
I just heard that he passed away.

909
00:51:46,759 --> 00:51:47,719
I am going there.

910
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:52,559
You should come along too.

911
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:53,959
After all,
you two belonged to the same category.

912
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:55,079
Dead.

913
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:56,959
What?

914
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:58,839
Passed away?

915
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:02,599
Come on.

916
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:09,439
Chanting

917
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:16,199
Chanting

918
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,759
Bharat Lal.

919
00:52:17,959 --> 00:52:20,359
Death came to him instantly.

920
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:23,319
But since he was
declared dead on papers...

921
00:52:23,999 --> 00:52:28,879
...he would die a new death every day.

922
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:30,799
Isn't that unbelievable.

923
00:52:30,879 --> 00:52:34,319
Until he was against the Law,
he was a criminal, and also alive.

924
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:38,959
And when he sought the help of the Law,
he ended up dead.

925
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,799
'Until he was against the Law,
he was a criminal, and also alive.'

926
00:52:42,919 --> 00:52:46,359
'Until he was against the Law,
he was a criminal, and also alive.'

927
00:52:46,439 --> 00:52:49,159
'Until he was against the Law,
he was a criminal, and also alive.'

928
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:57,039
"Even the alive gets buried."

929
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:04,039
"Even the alive gets buried."

930
00:53:18,873 --> 00:53:25,279
"The country's filled
with dishonest people."

931
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:32,319
"The country's filled
with dishonest people."

932
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:39,559
"Once you're declared
on official documents."

933
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:46,639
"The honest have tears in
their eyes watching this plight..."

934
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:53,959
"The country's filled
with dishonest people."

935
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:03,599
Sushil.

936
00:54:04,959 --> 00:54:06,879
- Come...
- Who?

937
00:54:07,799 --> 00:54:10,319
Your uncle.

938
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:18,079
Come on.

939
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:19,919
Come.

940
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:22,399
Give that to me.

941
00:54:22,479 --> 00:54:23,719
Here's a cholcate.

942
00:54:23,879 --> 00:54:27,399
Uncle. That's chocolate.

943
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:29,359
I see...and here's your toy.

944
00:54:29,919 --> 00:54:32,719
Sushil, we're going
to play 'kidnap' today.

945
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:33,919
How do you play that?

946
00:54:33,999 --> 00:54:35,279
Raise your hand.

947
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:38,479
Kidnap-Kidnap.

948
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,879
But you must wear a different
dress to play this game.

949
00:54:41,959 --> 00:54:43,519
Are you going to wear one too?

950
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:44,839
Of course?
I am going to wear it.

951
00:54:44,919 --> 00:54:47,719
Your aunt will wear it.

952
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:49,839
Straighten your arms.

953
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:00,279
- Bharat, what's inside the bag?
- Nothing, just an idol of Lord Ganesh.

954
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:03,599
Uncle, I am not Lord Ganesh.

955
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:09,199
I know, son.
But in this case, you got to lie.

956
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:11,999
Where's your mother?

957
00:55:12,399 --> 00:55:13,479
Rukmani.

958
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:16,039
What junk is in that?

959
00:55:19,279 --> 00:55:21,359
It's not junk. It's a treasure.

960
00:55:22,999 --> 00:55:24,439
Caught you, uncle.

961
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:26,119
Yes, you caught me.

962
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:28,119
- Who is that?
- He is Sushil.

963
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,039
- Brother Hari's son.
- I see...

964
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,279
- Go and play, son.
- Okay.

965
00:55:34,279 --> 00:55:35,599
What is all this?

966
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,359
Come here.

967
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:44,759
I've kidnapped Sushil.

968
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:45,759
What?

969
00:55:46,919 --> 00:55:48,559
Are you out of your mind?

970
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:52,199
Think about me, and the kids.

971
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:56,359
All I can think about is that
I don't want to die like that Bhisam.

972
00:55:56,839 --> 00:55:58,639
I am done using the right means.

973
00:55:58,999 --> 00:56:00,399
Do you want to become a criminal now?

974
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:01,159
Yes.

975
00:56:02,199 --> 00:56:03,439
I will become a criminal.

976
00:56:04,399 --> 00:56:05,759
In that film Bindiya and Bandook...

977
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,399
...what did she do after
all the atrocities she faced?

978
00:56:07,479 --> 00:56:08,559
What?

979
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:09,839
She took up a gun.

980
00:56:10,479 --> 00:56:12,759
And since I was wronged too,
I kidnapped Sushil.

981
00:56:13,439 --> 00:56:17,439
When the Law has already given me
the death sentence without any crime...

982
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,439
...then let's try to come
alive through committing a crime.

983
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:36,879
"The government and
administration are quiet."

984
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:44,079
"And turned me into a monster."

985
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:51,079
"Resorting lies and deceit."

986
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:57,839
"The country's filled
with dishonest people."

987
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:04,506
"My brother is benevolent.
And sister-in-law is so innocent."

988
00:57:04,749 --> 00:57:06,029
Hello, guys.

989
00:57:06,109 --> 00:57:07,869
Great.

990
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:10,899
Brother Hari,
a cricket has fallen into the syrup.

991
00:57:10,979 --> 00:57:11,779
Throw it out.

992
00:57:11,859 --> 00:57:13,459
But it's 5 kilos.

993
00:57:13,539 --> 00:57:16,299
You dumb man, throw the cricket.
Not the syrup.

994
00:57:17,979 --> 00:57:18,619
Brother...

995
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:20,899
These things are normal
in a confectionary shop.

996
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,779
You can't mourn for everyone.

997
00:57:31,339 --> 00:57:32,299
Hello.

998
00:57:33,979 --> 00:57:34,779
Hello.

999
00:57:34,969 --> 00:57:37,099
- Hello.
- Greetings, brother Hari.

1000
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:39,059
It's me, Bharat.

1001
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:43,259
Listen, your son Sushil.

1002
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:45,139
I've kidnapped him.

1003
00:57:46,636 --> 00:57:50,076
And if you want him back safe and sound
then go file a report with the Police.

1004
00:57:50,516 --> 00:57:51,396
Understood.

1005
00:57:51,476 --> 00:57:57,196
And if you try to find me or come after
me then you will never see Sushil again.

1006
00:57:58,716 --> 00:57:59,956
Hello, Bharat.

1007
00:58:00,036 --> 00:58:01,156
Bharat.

1008
00:58:03,556 --> 00:58:06,196
Hey Goonga, where is Devi bhaiya?

1009
00:58:06,596 --> 00:58:08,716
Bring him home immediately.

1010
00:58:13,236 --> 00:58:14,276
Mother.

1011
00:58:14,356 --> 00:58:16,356
What's wrong? What happened?

1012
00:58:16,716 --> 00:58:18,196
Mother...

1013
00:58:18,596 --> 00:58:21,716
That Bharat has lost his marbles.

1014
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,116
What happened?

1015
00:58:23,956 --> 00:58:24,876
- What happened, brother-in-law?
- Sister-in-law..

1016
00:58:24,956 --> 00:58:26,076
Why are you making a racket?

1017
00:58:26,156 --> 00:58:27,356
- Hariya...
- Brother.

1018
00:58:27,556 --> 00:58:29,436
I don't understand a word he's saying.

1019
00:58:30,676 --> 00:58:32,716
That Bharat...

1020
00:58:32,796 --> 00:58:33,396
Yes..

1021
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:36,476
...he abducted my Sushil.

1022
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:37,476
Oh no...

1023
00:58:38,436 --> 00:58:40,796
Do something.

1024
00:58:44,756 --> 00:58:46,876
Stop crying.

1025
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,436
- Quiet.
- Listen...

1026
00:58:48,516 --> 00:58:51,956
All of you go down to the Police
station and file a report against him.

1027
00:58:52,036 --> 00:58:53,836
He was saying the same thing, father.

1028
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:56,756
"Go and file a report or else
you will never see Sushil again."

1029
00:58:56,836 --> 00:58:58,556
- Go on.
- Come on.

1030
00:58:58,916 --> 00:59:00,756
Come on, hurry up.

1031
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:15,636
Look at her.

1032
00:59:16,236 --> 00:59:18,876
The shock has driven her crazy.

1033
00:59:23,996 --> 00:59:26,836
It's not me,
but you guys who have lost your mind.

1034
00:59:27,076 --> 00:59:30,676
My nephew has made a very cunning move.

1035
00:59:30,996 --> 00:59:35,956
He wants us to file
a report against him...

1036
00:59:36,116 --> 00:59:41,756
...so that his name is on official
documents and he's alive again.

1037
00:59:43,156 --> 00:59:44,676
Understand.

1038
00:59:45,556 --> 00:59:48,996
Mother. You're a genius.

1039
00:59:49,476 --> 00:59:55,796
Son, when it comes to cunningness,
your mother can win with her hands down.

1040
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:01,436
No need to go anywhere.

1041
01:00:01,836 --> 01:00:04,556
Go back to your work.

1042
01:00:04,996 --> 01:00:07,316
And watch Bharat Lal's charade.

1043
01:00:10,916 --> 01:00:12,196
Rukmani.

1044
01:00:12,596 --> 01:00:15,196
I think the Police
are here to arrest me.

1045
01:00:15,476 --> 01:00:17,916
I'll get something for the Police.

1046
01:00:20,036 --> 01:00:21,556
The messenger of God's coming.

1047
01:00:22,476 --> 01:00:25,476
Lord. Continue showering
your grace on me.

1048
01:00:25,836 --> 01:00:27,116
Please answer my prayers today.

1049
01:00:38,276 --> 01:00:39,469
Bharat Lal.

1050
01:00:39,596 --> 01:00:40,860
Bharat Lal.

1051
01:00:43,756 --> 01:00:45,156
Where did they go?

1052
01:00:46,436 --> 01:00:47,356
I don't know.

1053
01:00:48,396 --> 01:00:50,076
Move. Let me sit.

1054
01:00:50,996 --> 01:00:52,156
You dropped my marbles.

1055
01:00:52,516 --> 01:00:53,516
Pick it up then.

1056
01:00:55,356 --> 01:00:56,996
Now let me.

1057
01:01:01,716 --> 01:01:03,076
Give me the ball.

1058
01:01:03,476 --> 01:01:04,316
What was he saying?

1059
01:01:04,396 --> 01:01:07,036
He's killed Sushil, and left
evidence in the well in the fields.

1060
01:01:07,116 --> 01:01:08,156
Yes, brother.

1061
01:01:21,756 --> 01:01:22,596
Mother.

1062
01:01:22,676 --> 01:01:24,276
Be quiet. Quiet.

1063
01:01:25,156 --> 01:01:27,556
Bharat's definitely behind all this.

1064
01:01:27,676 --> 01:01:31,916
- He can't even kill a rat.
- You're right, mother.

1065
01:01:32,516 --> 01:01:36,236
Did Sushil grow wings?

1066
01:01:39,476 --> 01:01:41,036
Uncle. Brother Devi.

1067
01:01:41,236 --> 01:01:42,556
Brother Arun.

1068
01:01:43,076 --> 01:01:44,516
You arrived at the right time.

1069
01:01:44,996 --> 01:01:46,276
Come here.

1070
01:01:46,356 --> 01:01:48,596
Tell me whether this
human blood or chicken.

1071
01:01:48,676 --> 01:01:49,756
Or a rooster?

1072
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:51,956
How does the gender matter?

1073
01:01:52,316 --> 01:01:54,196
This is my chicken's blood.

1074
01:01:54,516 --> 01:01:57,036
Brother Bharat came to
my shop carrying this shirt.

1075
01:02:06,516 --> 01:02:07,676
Brother Arun.

1076
01:02:08,356 --> 01:02:10,436
Dip this shirt in your fowl's blood.

1077
01:02:10,636 --> 01:02:11,636
Huh...

1078
01:02:11,716 --> 01:02:13,156
It's a part of a ritual.

1079
01:02:13,236 --> 01:02:14,276
If my prayers get answered...

1080
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:17,396
...then it will be proven that
even I have human blood in my body.

1081
01:02:23,196 --> 01:02:25,836
I told you Bharat is behind all this.

1082
01:02:26,436 --> 01:02:27,516
Now wait and see...

1083
01:02:28,476 --> 01:02:32,236
...he'll bring Sushil back home again.

1084
01:02:33,676 --> 01:02:36,596
Uncle, I had a lot of fun.

1085
01:02:37,556 --> 01:02:39,716
We'll play this game again.

1086
01:02:39,996 --> 01:02:41,956
No, son. We won't play this game again.

1087
01:02:42,036 --> 01:02:43,676
Next time we will play something else.

1088
01:02:43,796 --> 01:02:45,116
Okay. I'll come over...

1089
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:47,036
Good you're here.

1090
01:02:47,116 --> 01:02:47,796
Father.

1091
01:02:47,876 --> 01:02:49,836
Here's your Sushil.

1092
01:02:49,916 --> 01:02:52,676
- Father, I'll teach you this kidnap-game too.
- Come with me.

1093
01:02:52,756 --> 01:02:54,236
What kind of a father and uncle are you?

1094
01:02:54,356 --> 01:02:56,196
You didn't even file an FIR.

1095
01:02:56,836 --> 01:02:58,676
FIR...huh!

1096
01:02:58,956 --> 01:03:00,996
Bloody no good.

1097
01:03:01,116 --> 01:03:03,756
Always up to no good.

1098
01:03:03,836 --> 01:03:05,636
Where do you think you're going?

1099
01:03:05,716 --> 01:03:07,516
I'll break your leg.

1100
01:03:07,596 --> 01:03:09,076
Beat him.

1101
01:03:13,396 --> 01:03:15,036
Beat him.

1102
01:03:15,116 --> 01:03:17,236
Catch him.

1103
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:20,716
He's running...

1104
01:03:31,316 --> 01:03:32,836
I think he's lost his mind.

1105
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:34,556
What are you doing?

1106
01:03:38,836 --> 01:03:41,276
Oh, God.

1107
01:03:41,756 --> 01:03:43,796
- Oh, God.
- Hey...what are you doing?

1108
01:03:43,876 --> 01:03:45,316
- Oh...
- Get up.

1109
01:03:45,756 --> 01:03:46,836
Stand up straight.

1110
01:03:47,036 --> 01:03:48,596
What is this?

1111
01:03:52,556 --> 01:03:53,676
Look.

1112
01:03:54,476 --> 01:03:55,756
Who beat you up.

1113
01:03:57,476 --> 01:04:03,196
Those monsters Hari Lal,
Devi Lal, and Goonga, my brothers.

1114
01:04:03,276 --> 01:04:06,796
- All three of them.
- Tell me how did the fight begin?

1115
01:04:06,996 --> 01:04:11,516
Sir, what will you
do if I abduct your child?

1116
01:04:11,596 --> 01:04:15,036
I will throw you in jail to rot.

1117
01:04:15,236 --> 01:04:16,836
And see this register...

1118
01:04:17,156 --> 01:04:20,356
I will charge you with dozens of felony.

1119
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:21,996
That's why...

1120
01:04:22,596 --> 01:04:25,036
That is exactly why I abducted Sushil...

1121
01:04:25,116 --> 01:04:26,876
...so that they can file a report.

1122
01:04:26,956 --> 01:04:27,876
What?

1123
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:32,516
Do you want to file a report against
your brother or get yourself arrested?

1124
01:04:32,596 --> 01:04:36,476
And I am feeling so guilty,
that i want to surrender.

1125
01:04:36,836 --> 01:04:39,516
Look mister,
this is not how one gets arrested.

1126
01:04:39,996 --> 01:04:42,756
It involves certain legal procedures.

1127
01:04:45,196 --> 01:04:47,396
- What is that?
- Procedure.

1128
01:04:47,796 --> 01:04:49,316
Are you trying to bribe me?

1129
01:04:49,436 --> 01:04:51,116
I'll be surprised
if you don't take it...

1130
01:04:51,196 --> 01:04:53,876
...and make me wonder that we've
officers like you in our country.

1131
01:04:54,476 --> 01:04:55,956
Yes.

1132
01:04:56,036 --> 01:04:57,476
See that pot.

1133
01:04:58,396 --> 01:04:59,876
Keep under it.

1134
01:05:02,836 --> 01:05:03,836
Did you?

1135
01:05:04,596 --> 01:05:06,356
Now leave, and come back next week.

1136
01:05:08,276 --> 01:05:10,436
Will I have to water the plants again?

1137
01:05:10,516 --> 01:05:12,516
We'll see when you come back again.

1138
01:05:12,596 --> 01:05:14,076
Now go.

1139
01:05:14,636 --> 01:05:16,316
Walk straight.

1140
01:05:17,236 --> 01:05:18,636
How dramatic...

1141
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:21,436
What on earth are you doing?

1142
01:05:21,516 --> 01:05:24,836
I prayed to
god that you get arrested.

1143
01:05:25,556 --> 01:05:28,476
The Lord is very benevolent.
Please get me arrested today.

1144
01:05:28,556 --> 01:05:30,476
Then all my sorrows will be alleviated.

1145
01:05:40,796 --> 01:05:41,876
Sir. Inspector sir.

1146
01:05:42,116 --> 01:05:43,756
- I am here.
- Yes.

1147
01:05:43,876 --> 01:05:44,716
What do you want?

1148
01:05:44,796 --> 01:05:46,716
I came to see you a couple of days ago,
and was writhing on the ground.

1149
01:05:46,796 --> 01:05:49,556
A dozen people showed up that day.

1150
01:05:50,076 --> 01:05:50,756
What was your purpose to come here?

1151
01:05:50,836 --> 01:05:52,996
Remember I wanted to surrender
in order to out of guilt.

1152
01:05:53,076 --> 01:05:55,076
If you're really feeling guilty...

1153
01:05:55,156 --> 01:05:59,076
...then why don't you go
jump in some river instead.

1154
01:06:00,236 --> 01:06:02,596
How can a dead man commit suicide?

1155
01:06:02,676 --> 01:06:05,236
- I see...
- You know what, just arrest me.

1156
01:06:05,556 --> 01:06:08,276
We only arrest living people,
not the dead.

1157
01:06:08,356 --> 01:06:09,316
- Please arrest me.
- Let's go.

1158
01:06:09,396 --> 01:06:11,196
My wife has prayed for me...please...

1159
01:06:11,276 --> 01:06:13,196
Sir...Sir...
What happened?

1160
01:06:13,276 --> 01:06:16,076
Did your brothers strike
a deal with them instead?

1161
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:22,996
You abducted your own nephew.

1162
01:06:23,076 --> 01:06:24,756
What abduction?

1163
01:06:26,156 --> 01:06:30,956
I spent a fortune and
still couldn't get arrested.

1164
01:06:31,716 --> 01:06:37,796
Oh, Bharat Lal, I understand your pain.

1165
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:43,876
But your antics will
also put your family in trouble.

1166
01:06:43,956 --> 01:06:45,316
What trouble?

1167
01:06:46,076 --> 01:06:48,116
How can things get any worse?

1168
01:06:49,076 --> 01:06:51,076
A corrupt man made a mistake.

1169
01:06:52,636 --> 01:06:54,156
So why doesn't he rectify it?

1170
01:06:54,596 --> 01:06:56,476
It's pretty simple, Bharat Lal.

1171
01:06:56,716 --> 01:06:59,876
Rectifying the mistake
means admitting he made one.

1172
01:07:00,676 --> 01:07:03,076
The problem with our system
is not rectifying the mistake...

1173
01:07:03,156 --> 01:07:05,876
...but admitting to
it in the first place.

1174
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,356
You've hit the nail on the head.

1175
01:07:08,676 --> 01:07:10,516
Now give me a solution as well.

1176
01:07:13,876 --> 01:07:15,076
You know what...

1177
01:07:16,553 --> 01:07:20,156
Used 'late' with your name.

1178
01:07:21,316 --> 01:07:23,396
Late Bharat Lal.

1179
01:07:23,636 --> 01:07:26,316
Just the name will be enough
for anyone to understand your problem.

1180
01:07:26,916 --> 01:07:27,956
Right.

1181
01:07:28,196 --> 01:07:29,436
Fantastic, madam.

1182
01:07:29,676 --> 01:07:31,116
Late Bharat Lal.

1183
01:07:31,276 --> 01:07:33,516
The son of India who is dead.

1184
01:07:38,076 --> 01:07:43,236
Taking Asharfi Devi's advice,
Bharat Lal...

1185
01:07:43,356 --> 01:07:47,356
...turned his naming ceremony
into a big event.

1186
01:07:47,436 --> 01:07:50,516
And on the same day...

1187
01:07:50,596 --> 01:07:53,796
...he found some more dead
persons like himself as bonus.

1188
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:55,196
You haven't left yet.

1189
01:07:55,276 --> 01:07:56,196
We're all dead.

1190
01:07:56,276 --> 01:08:01,516
After that Bharat Lal gathered
around people who were dead on papers...

1191
01:08:01,676 --> 01:08:03,716
...and started a political party.

1192
01:08:03,796 --> 01:08:06,476
I, Late Bharat Lal.

1193
01:08:08,156 --> 01:08:10,876
Am grateful to Asharfi Devi...

1194
01:08:10,956 --> 01:08:18,276
...without whom we could've
never taken such a big step.

1195
01:08:19,076 --> 01:08:24,156
Whether you call it a joke,
or believe the official papers...

1196
01:08:24,236 --> 01:08:27,076
...a lot of people
sitting here are dead.

1197
01:08:27,276 --> 01:08:28,236
Ghosts.

1198
01:08:30,515 --> 01:08:33,676
Ghost no. 1; Khudhiram.
From Gandhinagar.

1199
01:08:34,196 --> 01:08:36,796
Ghost no. 2; Basheshar.

1200
01:08:37,756 --> 01:08:41,356
Ghost no. 3; Ahmed Miya,
From Baliya.

1201
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:44,116
And, Ghost no. 4; Mahesh.

1202
01:08:44,276 --> 01:08:47,796
He's in a state of shock and
can't even explain where he's from.

1203
01:08:48,756 --> 01:08:52,116
And Ghost no.
5; Sita Devi from Rani Sarai.

1204
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:56,156
I am a little confused whether
ghosts and spirits have gender too

1205
01:08:56,475 --> 01:08:59,276
It's a little difficult to take each and
every name, and I don't remember them all.

1206
01:08:59,356 --> 01:09:00,595
I have a complete list.

1207
01:09:00,876 --> 01:09:03,316
So, with the blessings
of madam Asharfi Devi...

1208
01:09:03,395 --> 01:09:09,276
...the dead have decided
to together form an organization.

1209
01:09:09,756 --> 01:09:10,916
And...

1210
01:09:10,996 --> 01:09:13,236
Madam, we need you to uncover this.

1211
01:09:14,196 --> 01:09:19,276
The name of our party
is behind this curtain.

1212
01:09:20,515 --> 01:09:24,676
- Glory to...
- All India Association of Dead People.

1213
01:09:24,756 --> 01:09:26,475
- Glory to...
- All India Association of Dead People.

1214
01:09:26,555 --> 01:09:28,196
Is that your brother?

1215
01:09:28,395 --> 01:09:31,036
- Glory to...
- All India Association of Dead People.

1216
01:09:31,356 --> 01:09:31,996
Yes.

1217
01:09:32,076 --> 01:09:35,334
Now madam will hoist the flag.

1218
01:09:37,395 --> 01:09:43,636
An ordinary bandmaster has
made Asharfi Devi dance to his tunes.

1219
01:09:45,116 --> 01:09:46,716
He must be special.

1220
01:09:47,395 --> 01:09:49,756
No wonder you came seeking my refuge.

1221
01:10:07,676 --> 01:10:09,596
Your brother will gain nothing.

1222
01:10:10,796 --> 01:10:12,156
There are a lot of them.

1223
01:10:12,436 --> 01:10:14,556
Even I've done this before.

1224
01:10:14,636 --> 01:10:15,676
Yes.

1225
01:10:16,396 --> 01:10:18,276
I am an MLA.

1226
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:23,916
I won't let an ordinary bard ruin
this game I've been playing for decades.

1227
01:10:26,596 --> 01:10:27,876
Don't worry.

1228
01:10:27,956 --> 01:10:29,956
You're our benefactor, sir.

1229
01:10:33,316 --> 01:10:36,756
Our organization has received
a wonderful response.

1230
01:10:37,516 --> 01:10:40,996
And dead people from all
over the country are coming over...

1231
01:10:41,076 --> 01:10:43,236
...and joining our organization.

1232
01:10:45,196 --> 01:10:49,036
- Glory to...
- All India Association of Dead People..

1233
01:10:49,436 --> 01:10:50,676
Madam Speaker.

1234
01:10:50,756 --> 01:10:54,756
I want to divert this gathering
attention to a very critical problem...

1235
01:10:55,756 --> 01:11:00,036
...which has gripped our state.

1236
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:03,316
And it's called the Living Dead.

1237
01:11:03,516 --> 01:11:06,476
Madam, those who are
alive don't get justice...

1238
01:11:06,916 --> 01:11:08,636
...and you want justice for the dead.

1239
01:11:10,276 --> 01:11:13,996
Jaganpal's laughter
broke Sonia's heart...

1240
01:11:14,476 --> 01:11:17,756
...but she decide...

1241
01:11:18,076 --> 01:11:21,116
...to let people all over the
world know Bharat Lal's story.

1242
01:11:29,486 --> 01:11:31,286
Hail Sri Ram.

1243
01:11:32,966 --> 01:11:35,206
Om Namah Shivay.

1244
01:11:37,164 --> 01:11:39,766
Bharat Lal, here you go.

1245
01:11:39,926 --> 01:11:42,366
- Me.
- You're a famous personality.

1246
01:11:42,606 --> 01:11:44,766
Your picture's always in the papers.

1247
01:11:44,846 --> 01:11:47,606
Maybe someday my picture
will come on the papers too.

1248
01:11:48,486 --> 01:11:50,566
And anyway,
you've been very lucky for me.

1249
01:11:50,646 --> 01:11:55,046
Since the day I took up your case,
more cases have been pouring in.

1250
01:11:55,286 --> 01:11:56,406
That's why I opened this shop.

1251
01:11:56,486 --> 01:11:58,606
After closing down mine.

1252
01:12:00,206 --> 01:12:02,806
- Unbelievable.
- Come.

1253
01:12:03,006 --> 01:12:04,766
- Shall I cut it?
- Sure.

1254
01:12:05,686 --> 01:12:07,686
Great. Nice.

1255
01:12:08,286 --> 01:12:10,566
Thank you. Thank you.

1256
01:12:10,646 --> 01:12:13,366
Well Sadhuram,
now you're a famous lawyer.

1257
01:12:13,646 --> 01:12:14,606
So even your fee...

1258
01:12:14,686 --> 01:12:17,166
Well, there will be
a change in the fee...

1259
01:12:17,726 --> 01:12:20,246
From today whenever
I come over to your house...

1260
01:12:20,966 --> 01:12:27,326
...I will need a cup of
tea and a packet of biscuit.

1261
01:12:27,606 --> 01:12:30,566
- Can you manage that?
- Of course.

1262
01:12:30,966 --> 01:12:33,086
You took a big load off my back.

1263
01:12:33,406 --> 01:12:36,846
- How?
- I have no work.

1264
01:12:36,926 --> 01:12:40,486
Since I've been declared dead,
no one hires me either.

1265
01:12:40,686 --> 01:12:42,686
Sometimes I can't even
afford a proper meal.

1266
01:12:42,766 --> 01:12:46,086
Rukmani is living a life of a widow.

1267
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:47,966
Ohh...

1268
01:12:48,886 --> 01:12:50,286
- Bharat Lal.
- Yes.

1269
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,886
The government is
giving pension to widows.

1270
01:12:54,006 --> 01:12:54,806
Yeah...

1271
01:12:54,886 --> 01:12:56,126
Why don't you send sister-in-law too?

1272
01:12:56,966 --> 01:12:58,246
She will get pension.

1273
01:12:58,406 --> 01:13:02,366
And, even if they don't give pension,
it will be a slap on their face.

1274
01:13:05,366 --> 01:13:07,006
The slap will be better.

1275
01:13:07,326 --> 01:13:11,086
"The government's declared him dead..."

1276
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:15,806
"...but my husband's still alive."

1277
01:13:16,006 --> 01:13:19,686
"The government's declared him dead..."

1278
01:13:19,766 --> 01:13:24,526
"...but my husband's still alive."

1279
01:13:24,766 --> 01:13:27,406
"...my husband's still alive."

1280
01:13:27,526 --> 01:13:30,366
"...my husband's still alive."

1281
01:13:30,486 --> 01:13:33,166
"...my husband's still alive."

1282
01:13:33,246 --> 01:13:35,286
"...my husband's still alive."

1283
01:13:35,366 --> 01:13:40,366
"...but my husband's still alive."

1284
01:13:40,526 --> 01:13:44,006
"The government's declared him dead..."

1285
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:49,046
"...but my husband's still alive."

1286
01:13:58,326 --> 01:13:59,686
My heart's racing.

1287
01:13:59,766 --> 01:14:00,486
Okay.

1288
01:14:01,326 --> 01:14:03,246
What will I say to them.

1289
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:06,806
You are Bharat Lal's wife, don't worry.

1290
01:14:07,086 --> 01:14:08,366
Okay. Come on.

1291
01:14:11,806 --> 01:14:13,006
Come.

1292
01:14:14,486 --> 01:14:17,046
- Come with me.
- I'll stay outside.

1293
01:14:17,126 --> 01:14:18,446
- Are you coming?
- Yes.

1294
01:14:22,286 --> 01:14:24,686
So your husband Bharat Lal is dead.

1295
01:14:25,126 --> 01:14:26,606
Yes. It's been 10 years.

1296
01:14:26,966 --> 01:14:28,766
But you're dressed like a married woman.

1297
01:14:28,846 --> 01:14:29,846
Yes...

1298
01:14:30,406 --> 01:14:31,846
And this nuptial necklace.

1299
01:14:32,566 --> 01:14:35,526
My husband's officially dead.

1300
01:14:36,846 --> 01:14:39,766
- How is that possible?
- But its true, sir.

1301
01:14:41,886 --> 01:14:43,126
Have you lost your mind?

1302
01:14:43,206 --> 01:14:46,806
Look here...she's posing
as a widow for the money.

1303
01:14:46,886 --> 01:14:49,126
This is embarrassing.

1304
01:14:49,206 --> 01:14:52,246
I am not posing as one.
The government has made me this.

1305
01:14:52,886 --> 01:14:57,846
So what if I still
dress like a married woman.

1306
01:14:58,246 --> 01:15:01,526
Call me a widow and give me my pension.

1307
01:15:02,366 --> 01:15:04,926
Look, madam, this cannot be right.

1308
01:15:05,006 --> 01:15:05,606
Why?

1309
01:15:05,686 --> 01:15:10,326
Because a woman who doesn't
dress like a widow cannot be a widow.

1310
01:15:10,406 --> 01:15:12,166
Then declare my husband is alive.

1311
01:15:12,246 --> 01:15:14,086
That's not my job either.
It's the government's job.

1312
01:15:14,806 --> 01:15:18,406
Sir...you're our benefactor.

1313
01:15:18,646 --> 01:15:21,166
But you claim this is not your job.

1314
01:15:22,126 --> 01:15:23,566
Then where will else do we go?

1315
01:15:24,806 --> 01:15:28,486
Whom do we approach?
Who will give us justice?

1316
01:15:29,526 --> 01:15:32,686
We're tired. Please show us a way.

1317
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:35,886
We are starving.

1318
01:15:43,526 --> 01:15:46,126
Look...it will be lunch break soon.

1319
01:15:46,206 --> 01:15:49,086
I can offer you this food.

1320
01:15:55,126 --> 01:15:56,566
What did he say?

1321
01:15:57,006 --> 01:15:58,286
Who are you?

1322
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:00,486
I am her husband.

1323
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:04,166
You're her husband.

1324
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:09,048
You're the guy who died 10 years ago.

1325
01:16:11,406 --> 01:16:14,766
Come, mister.
I'll offer you some food too.

1326
01:16:15,326 --> 01:16:16,646
You don't have to make such excuses.

1327
01:16:16,726 --> 01:16:18,686
Just say that you're hungry.

1328
01:16:18,766 --> 01:16:20,086
We'll feed you.

1329
01:16:20,166 --> 01:16:21,926
Or go sit outside some temple.

1330
01:16:22,006 --> 01:16:23,326
We're not beggars!

1331
01:16:24,326 --> 01:16:25,726
We're not beggars!

1332
01:16:32,486 --> 01:16:33,606
Rukmani.

1333
01:16:33,726 --> 01:16:34,806
Rukmani.

1334
01:16:36,686 --> 01:16:37,726
What happened?

1335
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:41,406
There is no need to cry.

1336
01:16:42,086 --> 01:16:43,046
Hey...

1337
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:47,766
This is how they treat everyone
in government offices.

1338
01:16:47,846 --> 01:16:50,046
Wait. Rukmani. Don't cry.

1339
01:16:50,126 --> 01:16:51,206
Rukmani.

1340
01:16:51,286 --> 01:16:53,686
This is how they treat
in government offices.

1341
01:16:53,766 --> 01:16:55,246
I've been enduring this for 10 years.

1342
01:16:55,366 --> 01:16:58,606
Did I ever get angry,
or be heartbroken. Or cry.

1343
01:16:58,686 --> 01:17:00,566
This was your first time.

1344
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:02,726
In the Government office...

1345
01:17:03,166 --> 01:17:06,446
Rukmani couldn't tolerate her insult...

1346
01:17:06,806 --> 01:17:10,566
...and went to her uncle
and aunty to convey her sorrows.

1347
01:17:11,206 --> 01:17:14,886
Who had raised her.

1348
01:17:14,966 --> 01:17:19,126
And always took care of her happiness.

1349
01:17:19,726 --> 01:17:20,926
Move.

1350
01:17:22,274 --> 01:17:25,166
Sonia has written my story.

1351
01:17:26,286 --> 01:17:28,926
- I am leaving.
- Come. I'll drop you.

1352
01:17:31,806 --> 01:17:34,126
Take a picture of me with uncle.

1353
01:17:39,526 --> 01:17:40,766
Yes uncle...

1354
01:17:41,886 --> 01:17:44,846
Son, I cannot bear your plight.

1355
01:17:45,926 --> 01:17:51,046
Don't mind, but I've brought some money.

1356
01:17:51,526 --> 01:17:53,566
So you can restart your business again.

1357
01:17:58,961 --> 01:18:00,246
Is this why you went to see him?

1358
01:18:00,606 --> 01:18:03,126
No, son. She didn't say anything.

1359
01:18:03,206 --> 01:18:08,166
Uncle. Your Love and
respect is admirable.

1360
01:18:09,046 --> 01:18:11,766
But my self-respect is invaluable.

1361
01:18:13,886 --> 01:18:16,486
It's not about the money or my business.

1362
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:21,606
Some people have wronged me.

1363
01:18:23,006 --> 01:18:25,966
And I must show them
what they did was wrong.

1364
01:18:29,326 --> 01:18:31,726
A fight to gain my
respect and honor back.

1365
01:18:31,846 --> 01:18:33,166
Not money.

1366
01:18:33,686 --> 01:18:35,086
And what about me?

1367
01:18:37,326 --> 01:18:39,126
Don't you care about me?

1368
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:47,766
Vijay. If you tear that book,
I will thrash you.

1369
01:18:50,686 --> 01:18:54,006
Rukmani, even the foreigners
know about my problem.

1370
01:18:55,046 --> 01:18:56,726
This news is spreading far and wide.

1371
01:18:57,646 --> 01:18:59,326
And you want me to quit now.

1372
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:00,646
How can you quit now?

1373
01:19:00,726 --> 01:19:03,726
Because you've grown addicted
to seeing your picture in the papers.

1374
01:19:04,086 --> 01:19:06,326
It's all you think about all day.

1375
01:19:06,406 --> 01:19:07,726
You've lost your mind.

1376
01:19:08,886 --> 01:19:10,166
Then why come back to this madman.

1377
01:19:10,686 --> 01:19:12,286
Go stay with them.

1378
01:19:13,086 --> 01:19:14,726
What is this, son?

1379
01:19:15,286 --> 01:19:16,726
Try to understand, Rukmani.

1380
01:19:16,806 --> 01:19:18,366
She won't understand.

1381
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:21,766
She's the one who coaxed me
to take a loan in the first place.

1382
01:19:21,846 --> 01:19:24,006
Business was doing well.

1383
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:27,326
But she sent me against
my will to take a loan.

1384
01:19:28,286 --> 01:19:30,326
Just like there's a
woman behind every conflict...

1385
01:19:30,406 --> 01:19:32,326
...similarly,
you're the cause behind my plight.

1386
01:19:35,526 --> 01:19:36,526
What?

1387
01:19:40,046 --> 01:19:41,846
That's all I had to hear.

1388
01:19:43,766 --> 01:19:46,926
I am going to stay with my uncle,
And taking the kids too

1389
01:20:26,006 --> 01:20:27,326
Leave.

1390
01:20:28,806 --> 01:20:30,566
What is all this?

1391
01:20:53,886 --> 01:21:00,046
'With time, the rift grew
between Bharat Lal and Rukmani.'

1392
01:21:00,566 --> 01:21:03,806
'On one side,
lives were falling apart...'

1393
01:21:04,246 --> 01:21:05,446
- '...and on the other,

1394
01:21:05,686 --> 01:21:07,246
...new lives were beginning.'

1395
01:21:07,486 --> 01:21:08,766
You two are married now.

1396
01:21:08,846 --> 01:21:10,726
Smile more.

1397
01:21:11,886 --> 01:21:13,606
Congratulations. Congratulations.

1398
01:21:13,686 --> 01:21:15,686
- Hello, Mr. Sadhuram.
- Welcome. Welcome.

1399
01:21:15,766 --> 01:21:16,846
- Congratulations.
- Thank you

1400
01:21:16,926 --> 01:21:20,326
- Where is Bharat Lal?
- He's preparing to make a big explosion.

1401
01:21:20,726 --> 01:21:23,366
There's never a dull day around him.

1402
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:27,526
He's contesting the elections,
and against Rajiv Gandhi.

1403
01:21:27,606 --> 01:21:28,326
What?

1404
01:21:28,606 --> 01:21:31,846
- Glory to...
- All India Association of Dead People.

1405
01:21:32,046 --> 01:21:35,286
- Glory to...
- All India Association of Dead People.

1406
01:21:35,366 --> 01:21:39,766
- Glory to...
- All India Association of Dead People.

1407
01:21:39,846 --> 01:21:41,886
Vote on Skull.

1408
01:21:41,966 --> 01:21:43,806
Vote for Bharat Lal.

1409
01:21:43,886 --> 01:21:45,486
Vote on Skull.

1410
01:21:45,566 --> 01:21:47,486
Vote for Bharat Lal.

1411
01:21:47,566 --> 01:21:48,806
Vote on Skull.

1412
01:21:48,886 --> 01:21:50,526
Vote for Bharat Lal.

1413
01:21:50,606 --> 01:21:53,566
- Glory to...
- All India Association of Dead People.

1414
01:21:53,646 --> 01:21:56,886
- Glory to...
- All India Association of Dead People.

1415
01:21:56,966 --> 01:22:00,166
- Glory to...
- All India Association of Dead People.

1416
01:22:00,446 --> 01:22:04,886
What kind of a election symbol is skull?

1417
01:22:05,206 --> 01:22:07,406
Why? What's wrong with it?

1418
01:22:07,486 --> 01:22:09,046
We all have it.

1419
01:22:09,246 --> 01:22:10,246
You do too.

1420
01:22:10,326 --> 01:22:11,966
It will come out when the time comes.

1421
01:22:12,286 --> 01:22:13,526
Let's go.

1422
01:22:13,686 --> 01:22:17,646
Bharat Lal did contest the election,
but not for winning.

1423
01:22:17,726 --> 01:22:19,126
Only to lose.

1424
01:22:19,566 --> 01:22:21,646
He also distributed sweets for his loss.

1425
01:22:22,606 --> 01:22:26,246
Because his plan was he
would appeal to Allahabad court...

1426
01:22:26,486 --> 01:22:29,846
...that if he's dead,
then this election should be annulled,

1427
01:22:29,926 --> 01:22:32,486
because how can a
dead man's nomination...

1428
01:22:32,566 --> 01:22:35,046
...be accepted for the election.

1429
01:22:35,526 --> 01:22:38,806
And if they don't annul the election,
then he should be declared alive.

1430
01:22:39,246 --> 01:22:42,526
Bharat Lal, the elections are over.
What now?

1431
01:22:43,046 --> 01:22:46,966
Mr. Sadhuram,
Bharat Lal's definitely alive.

1432
01:22:48,446 --> 01:22:50,886
Sir, since you believe
that then why don't you...

1433
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:53,166
...give it in writing
yourself that I am alive.

1434
01:22:53,246 --> 01:22:56,766
See your honor,
I told you this man is crazy.

1435
01:22:57,126 --> 01:23:00,366
This man likes to create
hurdles for the government...

1436
01:23:00,446 --> 01:23:02,246
...just to make it on the headlines.

1437
01:23:02,326 --> 01:23:05,526
Even his wife has said that he's crazy.

1438
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:07,766
Every wife says that.

1439
01:23:07,846 --> 01:23:09,646
I am sure your honor's
wife says that too.

1440
01:23:10,126 --> 01:23:13,926
But his wife didn't leave him.

1441
01:23:14,326 --> 01:23:15,926
What a stupid conversation.

1442
01:23:16,086 --> 01:23:17,686
Stop dragging my wife in this.

1443
01:23:19,246 --> 01:23:20,606
I am still unmarried.

1444
01:23:21,446 --> 01:23:22,646
Actually I didn't want to.

1445
01:23:23,886 --> 01:23:25,166
Couldn't find one.

1446
01:23:26,806 --> 01:23:27,806
And Bharat Lal...

1447
01:23:28,686 --> 01:23:31,806
The elections you want
to get annulled was not a game.

1448
01:23:32,806 --> 01:23:34,286
The former Prime Minister
was a part of it.

1449
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:37,086
Do you know the efforts
it takes to conduct an election?

1450
01:23:37,166 --> 01:23:38,126
And the time.

1451
01:23:38,806 --> 01:23:40,486
Their time and the court's time...

1452
01:23:40,806 --> 01:23:41,886
...cannot be wasted,
the court won't allow it.

1453
01:23:41,966 --> 01:23:42,726
Understand.

1454
01:23:42,806 --> 01:23:45,166
The court's only losing time...

1455
01:23:45,846 --> 01:23:47,206
...whereas I am losing out on my life.

1456
01:23:47,286 --> 01:23:47,966
What about that?

1457
01:23:48,046 --> 01:23:51,046
For the past 12 years
I've been waiting to be alive again.

1458
01:23:51,206 --> 01:23:54,646
The case of whether you're dead or
alive is being heard in another court...

1459
01:23:54,926 --> 01:23:56,246
...and the decision is still pending.

1460
01:23:58,926 --> 01:24:01,246
Sadhuram. Let's dismiss this case.

1461
01:24:01,726 --> 01:24:04,206
You can dismiss this case or whatever.

1462
01:24:04,286 --> 01:24:05,726
But make me alive.

1463
01:24:05,926 --> 01:24:07,246
How can I prove you alive.

1464
01:24:08,086 --> 01:24:09,966
The Record Keeper has
declared you dead on paper.

1465
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:13,886
You're talking about papers,
and I am talking about humans.

1466
01:24:14,486 --> 01:24:15,566
You're the court.

1467
01:24:16,526 --> 01:24:18,846
Will you believe papers,
or a living man?

1468
01:24:19,726 --> 01:24:21,526
What is more important,
papers or humans.

1469
01:24:22,686 --> 01:24:25,366
Do humans have a heart or do paper?

1470
01:24:25,486 --> 01:24:28,606
Do humans have blood or do paper?

1471
01:24:28,686 --> 01:24:31,766
Do papers have wife
and kids or do humans?

1472
01:24:35,606 --> 01:24:38,566
When India was a golden bird,
these courts existed back then too...

1473
01:24:39,446 --> 01:24:44,086
...so were these lawyers, and papers.

1474
01:24:45,566 --> 01:24:48,046
But the plight of humans
was never like this.

1475
01:24:53,806 --> 01:24:55,086
Can't you see?

1476
01:24:55,366 --> 01:24:59,286
A living man is standing before you.
Yelling...his head is about to explode.

1477
01:24:59,606 --> 01:25:01,086
Are you blind?

1478
01:25:01,286 --> 01:25:04,886
I knew that the Law was blind,
but so are judges.

1479
01:25:05,606 --> 01:25:07,686
I think you're an ignorant man.

1480
01:25:07,806 --> 01:25:08,926
Do you know the consequences?

1481
01:25:09,166 --> 01:25:09,766
This is contempt...

1482
01:25:09,846 --> 01:25:12,566
You can do anything you
want for contempt of court.

1483
01:25:13,006 --> 01:25:15,166
Hang me, kill me, throw me to the lions.

1484
01:25:15,566 --> 01:25:18,846
But stop hanging me in
the middle like a pendulum.

1485
01:25:20,446 --> 01:25:23,806
He's staring at me like a stupid pigeon.

1486
01:25:35,046 --> 01:25:38,406
I can see you're waiting to explode.

1487
01:25:42,366 --> 01:25:43,526
Adjourn the court.

1488
01:25:44,126 --> 01:25:45,326
Let's adjourn the court.

1489
01:25:46,886 --> 01:25:48,046
Adjourn the court.

1490
01:25:49,126 --> 01:25:50,366
Come on.

1491
01:25:51,886 --> 01:25:53,286
Hail Sri Ram.

1492
01:25:55,686 --> 01:25:59,806
Bharat Lal, what have you done?
You can get in trouble.

1493
01:26:01,126 --> 01:26:02,366
I haven't done anything.

1494
01:26:02,446 --> 01:26:03,646
It was all intentional.

1495
01:26:03,886 --> 01:26:07,686
Now he will get me arrested,
and my name will come on the register.

1496
01:26:08,286 --> 01:26:09,886
Great.

1497
01:26:10,646 --> 01:26:13,166
I see...you're a master.

1498
01:26:13,246 --> 01:26:16,686
I am learning from the master.

1499
01:26:16,926 --> 01:26:19,966
Don't you think you should
get the man arrested?

1500
01:26:20,486 --> 01:26:22,046
- Did you get the fritters?
- Yes, sir.

1501
01:26:22,126 --> 01:26:23,526
From Radheshyam's shop.

1502
01:26:26,766 --> 01:26:28,366
- Radheshyam?
- Yes, sir.

1503
01:26:28,446 --> 01:26:30,286
Mr. Tyagi, I am a judge.

1504
01:26:30,806 --> 01:26:32,646
Don't you think I can
judge where they are from.

1505
01:26:38,446 --> 01:26:39,646
It's very spicy.

1506
01:26:41,606 --> 01:26:45,126
What he said was also pricking,
but it was true.

1507
01:26:47,046 --> 01:26:51,886
Actually, our system has become a
weapon of torture for the common man.

1508
01:26:52,806 --> 01:26:54,166
And it can be reformed...

1509
01:26:54,566 --> 01:26:58,326
...only when madmen like Bharat
Lal will cross all boundaries.

1510
01:26:59,886 --> 01:27:01,526
I won't take any action against him.

1511
01:27:02,446 --> 01:27:05,766
And even the court
can't lay a hand on him.

1512
01:27:10,446 --> 01:27:15,806
Even after insulting the judge,
he wasn't arrested.

1513
01:27:16,134 --> 01:27:20,966
Bharat Lal's luck was indeed his bad luck.

1514
01:27:22,913 --> 01:27:25,513
Uncle...did you win a jackpot?

1515
01:27:25,593 --> 01:27:27,633
No, dear.

1516
01:27:28,383 --> 01:27:31,703
First the elections,
then the rally...

1517
01:27:31,823 --> 01:27:35,183
It's been so long,
and yet no news of son-in-law.

1518
01:27:35,263 --> 01:27:36,743
Is everything alright?

1519
01:27:37,063 --> 01:27:38,383
What is he saying?

1520
01:27:38,663 --> 01:27:39,903
Should I go take a look?

1521
01:27:39,983 --> 01:27:41,583
He will be fine.

1522
01:27:42,583 --> 01:27:44,583
He won't give up easily.

1523
01:27:45,063 --> 01:27:47,103
This is the silence before the storm.

1524
01:27:49,143 --> 01:27:51,623
We're coming too.

1525
01:27:51,703 --> 01:27:53,023
Sit down.

1526
01:27:53,183 --> 01:27:54,183
Be quiet.

1527
01:27:54,263 --> 01:27:56,143
Rukmani was right.

1528
01:27:56,263 --> 01:27:57,903
The storm had arrived.

1529
01:27:58,143 --> 01:28:00,663
With Ashrafi Devi's
recommendation Bharat Lal got a

1530
01:28:00,743 --> 01:28:03,783
...visiting gallery
pass for the parliament...

1531
01:28:03,863 --> 01:28:08,823
...and did what shook
even the parliament.

1532
01:28:16,543 --> 01:28:18,063
Be quiet.

1533
01:28:18,343 --> 01:28:21,063
Please maintain silence.

1534
01:28:28,103 --> 01:28:30,703
The nation is watching us.

1535
01:28:32,743 --> 01:28:35,423
Long live...all India Association
For Dead People.

1536
01:28:35,503 --> 01:28:38,183
Long live...all India Association
For Dead People.

1537
01:28:38,263 --> 01:28:41,103
Long live...all India Association
For Dead People.

1538
01:28:41,183 --> 01:28:43,903
Long live...all India Association
For Dead People.

1539
01:28:43,983 --> 01:28:45,263
Make me alive again.

1540
01:28:45,343 --> 01:28:47,063
I've been declared dead.

1541
01:28:47,143 --> 01:28:48,543
Make me alive again.

1542
01:28:48,663 --> 01:28:50,103
I want justice.

1543
01:28:50,183 --> 01:28:51,943
Who is that idiot?

1544
01:28:52,023 --> 01:28:55,383
He's a mad man.
Don't you read the newspaper?

1545
01:28:55,463 --> 01:28:57,263
- He makes a scene every day.
- He's up to something no good every day.

1546
01:28:57,343 --> 01:28:58,863
I am not a terrorist.

1547
01:28:59,263 --> 01:29:00,943
I am a citizen of this country.

1548
01:29:01,023 --> 01:29:02,503
Vande Mataram.

1549
01:29:02,863 --> 01:29:05,103
East or West, India is the best.

1550
01:29:05,183 --> 01:29:07,063
Even I grew up singing
the national anthem!

1551
01:29:07,143 --> 01:29:08,063
And listen...

1552
01:29:08,143 --> 01:29:10,063
I only threw pamphlets.

1553
01:29:10,143 --> 01:29:12,023
I want justice.

1554
01:29:12,103 --> 01:29:13,863
Make me alive again.

1555
01:29:14,023 --> 01:29:16,103
I've been declared dead.

1556
01:29:16,183 --> 01:29:17,743
Make me alive again.

1557
01:29:17,823 --> 01:29:19,103
Where else will I go?

1558
01:29:19,183 --> 01:29:22,503
If you don't give me justice,
then who will.

1559
01:29:22,783 --> 01:29:24,343
Long live...all India Association
For Dead People.

1560
01:29:24,423 --> 01:29:25,463
What is happening, sir?

1561
01:29:25,543 --> 01:29:27,223
That could've been
a bomb as well.

1562
01:29:27,703 --> 01:29:28,583
Paper Bomb.

1563
01:29:29,103 --> 01:29:30,023
Leave me.

1564
01:29:30,103 --> 01:29:33,943
If I have wronged,
then punish me. Hang me.

1565
01:29:36,983 --> 01:29:39,263
Take good care of
that dead man coming.

1566
01:29:39,823 --> 01:29:43,143
When Bhagat Singh threw
pamphlets he was sent to jail.

1567
01:29:43,223 --> 01:29:44,623
Send me to jail as well.

1568
01:29:44,703 --> 01:29:46,383
Hang me.

1569
01:29:47,903 --> 01:29:49,783
- Send me to jail as well.
- How dare you throw pamphlets?

1570
01:29:49,863 --> 01:29:51,383
So you want to be a freedom fighter.

1571
01:29:53,863 --> 01:29:54,943
Stand straight.

1572
01:29:55,023 --> 01:29:56,143
Show me what else are you hiding.

1573
01:29:56,223 --> 01:29:57,423
What are you hiding in your pants.
Take his pants off.

1574
01:29:57,503 --> 01:29:59,903
Take it off.
Check what else is he hiding?

1575
01:30:00,623 --> 01:30:03,103
- Take his pants off.
- Not my clothes.

1576
01:30:04,183 --> 01:30:05,823
Hit him.

1577
01:30:05,903 --> 01:30:07,983
Take it off.

1578
01:30:11,423 --> 01:30:13,183
So you want to be a freedom fighter.

1579
01:30:13,383 --> 01:30:14,063
Hit him.

1580
01:30:15,383 --> 01:30:16,423
Throw pamphlets will you?

1581
01:30:21,063 --> 01:30:22,143
Mad man.

1582
01:30:22,223 --> 01:30:24,383
Ghost uncle.

1583
01:30:24,463 --> 01:30:26,183
You've lost your mind.

1584
01:30:26,263 --> 01:30:27,183
So you want to be a freedom fighter.

1585
01:30:27,263 --> 01:30:28,903
He's a lunatic. A mad man.

1586
01:30:28,983 --> 01:30:31,703
Call the dog catchers.

1587
01:30:31,783 --> 01:30:33,503
He has really lost his mind.

1588
01:30:33,583 --> 01:30:34,623
He is crazy.

1589
01:30:34,703 --> 01:30:36,183
This has become a routine.

1590
01:30:36,263 --> 01:30:38,063
He's crazy.

1591
01:30:38,383 --> 01:30:42,103
It was easy for Lord
Ram...to slay Ravan.

1592
01:30:42,783 --> 01:30:45,663
He had 10 heads,
but they were all visible.

1593
01:30:46,903 --> 01:30:53,583
But this system has many heads,
mouths, and eyes.

1594
01:30:53,903 --> 01:30:59,583
And each wants to devour
the privileges and rights of a poor man.

1595
01:30:59,823 --> 01:31:02,583
How do we fight with this system?

1596
01:31:06,865 --> 01:31:10,377
Bharat Lal's morale was completely down.

1597
01:31:10,848 --> 01:31:15,792
Now he needed his wife and children together.

1598
01:31:16,863 --> 01:31:18,943
Listen, come home with the kids.

1599
01:31:19,423 --> 01:31:21,023
I will do as you say.

1600
01:31:21,103 --> 01:31:24,383
I will quit this battle.

1601
01:31:27,783 --> 01:31:32,863
You know what was my biggest mistake.

1602
01:31:32,943 --> 01:31:34,903
- Marrying me?
- No...

1603
01:31:37,063 --> 01:31:38,623
Leaving you alone.

1604
01:31:39,103 --> 01:31:40,943
Bharat. Tea.

1605
01:31:44,983 --> 01:31:46,823
And what will be a Bigger mistake?

1606
01:31:48,783 --> 01:31:54,423
Coming back and shattering your courage.

1607
01:31:56,663 --> 01:32:00,503
In all these years, this battle
has become the foundation of your life.

1608
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:02,543
Your goal.

1609
01:32:05,303 --> 01:32:08,783
You must win this battle for all of us.

1610
01:32:09,903 --> 01:32:13,863
I won't weaken you now, by coming along.

1611
01:32:16,703 --> 01:32:18,063
You were mad.

1612
01:32:19,063 --> 01:32:20,023
...you still are,

1613
01:32:21,263 --> 01:32:22,383
...and always will be.

1614
01:32:24,743 --> 01:32:31,343
When you win,
I will be the first to garland you.

1615
01:32:32,423 --> 01:32:33,703
And what if l lose

1616
01:32:36,143 --> 01:32:37,383
I've heard a saying.

1617
01:32:40,943 --> 01:32:48,063
Even if a man loses, he should lose doing
what he loves the most.

1618
01:32:57,547 --> 01:32:59,583
She is an ideal mother.

1619
01:33:10,823 --> 01:33:14,703
[Chanting]

1620
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:43,863
Madam.

1621
01:33:43,943 --> 01:33:46,063
Invitation to Bharat
Lal's funeral ceremony.

1622
01:34:18,063 --> 01:34:19,703
"Lekhpak Swaha."

1623
01:34:19,823 --> 01:34:21,503
"Nyaypalika Swaha."

1624
01:34:21,583 --> 01:34:23,343
"System Swaha."

1625
01:34:23,543 --> 01:34:25,183
"Vidhansabha Swaha."

1626
01:34:26,383 --> 01:34:27,903
Don't drop me, okay.

1627
01:34:27,983 --> 01:34:30,783
I've never lain on a pyre before.
It scares me.

1628
01:34:31,063 --> 01:34:32,103
Oh...

1629
01:34:32,783 --> 01:34:34,503
Come here.

1630
01:34:35,623 --> 01:34:37,543
Fix the nails.

1631
01:34:38,183 --> 01:34:39,383
Or you won't get paid.

1632
01:34:40,423 --> 01:34:43,903
Brother,
you see...the dead sleep on this.

1633
01:34:44,223 --> 01:34:46,143
So I've never really
received any complaints.

1634
01:34:46,223 --> 01:34:47,423
Come, brother Bharat.

1635
01:34:48,143 --> 01:34:49,983
Yours is special.

1636
01:34:50,063 --> 01:34:52,943
The rest is petrol, and this is diesel.

1637
01:34:53,143 --> 01:34:54,263
I've put a pillow as well.

1638
01:34:54,863 --> 01:34:57,863
- Glory to...
- All India Association for Dead People

1639
01:34:57,943 --> 01:34:59,743
- Glory to...
- All India Association for Dead People

1640
01:34:59,823 --> 01:35:01,143
Let's go.

1641
01:35:01,223 --> 01:35:03,703
We're losing time.

1642
01:35:04,583 --> 01:35:07,743
- Glory to...
- All India Association for Dead People

1643
01:35:07,863 --> 01:35:11,143
- Glory to...
- All India Association for Dead People

1644
01:35:11,223 --> 01:35:13,463
- Glory to...
- All India Association for Dead People

1645
01:35:13,543 --> 01:35:17,423
See...the world never
wants women to progress.

1646
01:35:17,823 --> 01:35:20,223
Not a single woman in the procession.

1647
01:35:20,303 --> 01:35:22,783
You're right. That's how men are.

1648
01:35:22,863 --> 01:35:24,183
Glory to...

1649
01:35:24,263 --> 01:35:26,463
- Glory to...
- All India Association for Dead People

1650
01:35:26,543 --> 01:35:29,623
Sir, they are the reason
behind this trouble.

1651
01:35:29,823 --> 01:35:33,303
Tell them to return his land,
and finish this feud.

1652
01:35:33,983 --> 01:35:36,463
Or else he will make our lives hell.

1653
01:35:36,543 --> 01:35:38,143
Look at the wise guy.

1654
01:35:38,543 --> 01:35:40,663
You mean to say we return
his land and get stuck ourselves.

1655
01:35:40,743 --> 01:35:44,263
Why don't you return the lands
of your relatives that you've usurped.

1656
01:35:44,343 --> 01:35:45,743
Yes...
Shut up.

1657
01:35:47,743 --> 01:35:48,903
I said shut up.

1658
01:35:50,103 --> 01:35:51,583
Stop making a mountain out of a mole.

1659
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:54,183
Sir, one spark can burn down the jungle.

1660
01:35:56,543 --> 01:36:00,100
I can douse such sparks with my pee.

1661
01:36:00,663 --> 01:36:02,583
My dead brothers and sisters...

1662
01:36:03,463 --> 01:36:05,903
...today will be the
beginning of a new dawn.

1663
01:36:06,943 --> 01:36:11,423
And we dead people were forced
to resort to this funeral rally.

1664
01:36:11,703 --> 01:36:15,703
So that the government
can pay heed to our problems.

1665
01:36:16,263 --> 01:36:18,983
People are carried in
caskets after they are dead...

1666
01:36:19,343 --> 01:36:22,103
...but we're doing
so to be declared alive.

1667
01:36:22,503 --> 01:36:26,103
We're heading straight
for the record keeper's office.

1668
01:36:26,183 --> 01:36:30,423
And prove ourselves
alive on official papers.

1669
01:36:31,063 --> 01:36:35,503
Bharat Lal is putting himself
in danger by breaking the Law.

1670
01:36:36,223 --> 01:36:37,103
Hello, Kevat.

1671
01:36:37,703 --> 01:36:40,943
I've informed the CM. He's on his way.

1672
01:36:41,023 --> 01:36:41,943
Please wait over there.

1673
01:36:42,023 --> 01:36:43,103
Thank you.

1674
01:36:58,023 --> 01:36:59,303
No, sir.

1675
01:36:59,543 --> 01:37:01,583
It's a rally of madmen.

1676
01:37:01,663 --> 01:37:03,663
We're enough to handle them.

1677
01:37:03,743 --> 01:37:05,023
We'll handle them.

1678
01:37:05,183 --> 01:37:07,183
Sir, this is a cricket match.

1679
01:37:07,503 --> 01:37:10,303
Only a handful of protestors
and thousands of audience.

1680
01:37:10,463 --> 01:37:12,063
We'll handle them.

1681
01:37:14,143 --> 01:37:17,223
It's too hot. Someone give me water.

1682
01:37:17,303 --> 01:37:18,863
Normal or Holy water?

1683
01:37:18,943 --> 01:37:20,543
Anything will do.

1684
01:37:31,583 --> 01:37:33,463
Madam, this is the
time to reap the rewards.

1685
01:37:33,663 --> 01:37:35,343
Whether you cast a stone or not...

1686
01:37:35,423 --> 01:37:37,703
...the reward shall fall in your lap.

1687
01:37:38,263 --> 01:37:40,103
This is a win-win situation for you.

1688
01:37:40,183 --> 01:37:41,223
Meaning?

1689
01:37:41,303 --> 01:37:42,263
Please sit there.

1690
01:37:42,863 --> 01:37:44,183
Mr. Chaudhary, please.

1691
01:37:44,943 --> 01:37:48,463
I mean...let what's happening, happen.

1692
01:37:49,143 --> 01:37:53,383
If Bharat Lal wins,
then he will give you credit for it.

1693
01:37:53,623 --> 01:37:58,543
And you'll become the
Savior of a poor helpless man.

1694
01:37:58,983 --> 01:38:00,783
And if something happens to him...

1695
01:38:00,863 --> 01:38:06,103
...then you'll still be a strict,
and law-abiding politician.

1696
01:38:06,223 --> 01:38:09,263
Just wait and watch.

1697
01:38:09,583 --> 01:38:11,183
I don't agree.

1698
01:38:14,863 --> 01:38:16,623
But I do understand.

1699
01:38:18,463 --> 01:38:22,143
The farmer sows seeds so
he can reap the crops one day.

1700
01:38:23,943 --> 01:38:26,783
And even in politics,
we entertain scapegoats...

1701
01:38:26,863 --> 01:38:29,863
...only to be sacrificed
at the right time.

1702
01:38:30,823 --> 01:38:33,383
I'll tell you who is actually dead.

1703
01:38:34,543 --> 01:38:39,463
One who has the right to
give you justice, but doesn't do so.

1704
01:38:39,823 --> 01:38:41,263
Is a dead man.

1705
01:38:43,823 --> 01:38:45,783
You living men...

1706
01:38:46,503 --> 01:38:51,943
take a peek in your heart,
and check whether you're alive or dead?

1707
01:38:52,383 --> 01:38:56,143
Thank you very much
for coming in this area.

1708
01:38:56,503 --> 01:39:00,423
- I told you about Bharat Lal.
- Yes, you did.

1709
01:39:00,783 --> 01:39:07,383
But, he's spreading a state of anarchy in
the entire country over a small issue...

1710
01:39:07,463 --> 01:39:09,263
...and that is not good.

1711
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:10,943
- Sir, I...
- Just a minute, sir.

1712
01:39:11,463 --> 01:39:13,183
This is not a small issue.

1713
01:39:13,863 --> 01:39:17,503
We've developed considerably
post our independence.

1714
01:39:18,503 --> 01:39:21,503
Men have reached the moon, and
our country has made it to outer space.

1715
01:39:22,143 --> 01:39:25,863
We have won two wars, four Olympic gold
medals, even the cricket world cup...

1716
01:39:25,943 --> 01:39:27,463
...and we even have nuclear power.

1717
01:39:28,183 --> 01:39:31,303
But Bharat Lal is
still where he started.

1718
01:39:32,303 --> 01:39:34,903
Bharat Lal doesn't
want to go to the moon,

1719
01:39:34,983 --> 01:39:38,063
or win war against Pakistan,
nor does he want nuclear power.

1720
01:39:38,143 --> 01:39:40,383
He just wants his identity back.

1721
01:39:41,143 --> 01:39:44,503
Just a small piece of paper
that proves that he's alive.

1722
01:39:44,943 --> 01:39:46,463
I've heard you.

1723
01:39:46,543 --> 01:39:47,983
That was a good speech.

1724
01:39:48,463 --> 01:39:53,023
But the government doesn't
act on speeches, but on a system.

1725
01:39:55,023 --> 01:39:57,503
- The record keeper has killed us...
- With his pen.

1726
01:39:57,583 --> 01:40:00,983
Sir, let's get out of
here before something happens.

1727
01:40:01,063 --> 01:40:02,663
How can anything happen.

1728
01:40:02,743 --> 01:40:03,543
This is the Tehsil office.

1729
01:40:03,623 --> 01:40:05,063
He's the new Record Keeper.

1730
01:40:05,143 --> 01:40:06,983
Their threats can't scare me.

1731
01:40:07,943 --> 01:40:09,983
Move.

1732
01:40:10,063 --> 01:40:11,423
Come on.

1733
01:40:11,503 --> 01:40:12,783
Let's go.

1734
01:40:23,143 --> 01:40:25,423
Let's go break that
record keeper's head.

1735
01:40:26,503 --> 01:40:28,743
And Bharat Lal will be blamed for it.

1736
01:40:34,343 --> 01:40:37,943
It was the old record keeper
Bhure Lal's mistake, not mine.

1737
01:40:39,983 --> 01:40:41,503
- I haven't done anything.
- Get the papers.

1738
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:43,103
It's an 18-year-old case.

1739
01:40:43,183 --> 01:40:45,183
It must be in the record room.

1740
01:40:45,263 --> 01:40:46,183
Then give me the keys.

1741
01:40:46,263 --> 01:40:49,383
We won't let you go. Give me...

1742
01:40:49,663 --> 01:40:52,463
Our fight is against the system,
not them.

1743
01:40:52,543 --> 01:40:54,303
Kill Him.

1744
01:40:54,543 --> 01:40:56,983
Drag them out. They are not our comrades.

1745
01:40:57,063 --> 01:40:59,663
My comrades are not violent.

1746
01:40:59,903 --> 01:41:02,223
Get out. They are robbing the country.

1747
01:41:11,183 --> 01:41:12,623
- Give me the keys.
- Take it.

1748
01:41:12,703 --> 01:41:15,783
And go find the needle in the haystack.

1749
01:41:15,863 --> 01:41:17,463
- Come on.
- Come on, brother.

1750
01:41:17,543 --> 01:41:18,863
Let's go inside.

1751
01:41:19,703 --> 01:41:21,503
Police! Police!

1752
01:41:26,583 --> 01:41:29,223
He's in the record room.

1753
01:41:32,823 --> 01:41:35,303
- Catch him.
- Get him out of the record room.

1754
01:41:40,983 --> 01:41:43,223
Drag him out. Find them.

1755
01:41:51,663 --> 01:41:53,383
Up there.

1756
01:41:53,583 --> 01:41:55,863
Catch him. Catch him.

1757
01:42:00,103 --> 01:42:01,583
Catch him.

1758
01:42:06,823 --> 01:42:08,783
Brother, found out.

1759
01:42:09,023 --> 01:42:10,983
Brother, Salanpur.

1760
01:42:11,063 --> 01:42:12,943
Brother...Salanpur.

1761
01:42:16,503 --> 01:42:20,303
"Covered under a dust..."

1762
01:42:20,383 --> 01:42:24,143
"...stashed away in paper..."

1763
01:42:24,223 --> 01:42:30,143
"...life was rotting away."

1764
01:42:31,903 --> 01:42:35,663
"The one I pined for..."

1765
01:42:35,743 --> 01:42:39,503
"...and was searching
all my life for it."

1766
01:42:39,583 --> 01:42:46,703
"Finally I found that life."

1767
01:42:47,263 --> 01:42:53,783
"The world had to bow
before your determination."

1768
01:42:54,903 --> 01:43:01,703
"Now the world says to you."

1769
01:43:02,503 --> 01:43:06,423
"May you live long..."

1770
01:43:06,503 --> 01:43:10,463
"May you live long..."

1771
01:43:11,623 --> 01:43:13,383
Stop.

1772
01:43:14,503 --> 01:43:16,583
Please stop.

1773
01:43:18,583 --> 01:43:20,983
Bharat Lal, you are alive.

1774
01:43:24,783 --> 01:43:27,023
Bharat Lal, you are alive.

1775
01:43:27,623 --> 01:43:29,383
Bharat Lal, you are alive.

1776
01:43:36,983 --> 01:43:37,943
Look.

1777
01:43:38,503 --> 01:43:43,063
The PM's orders has annulled
the record keeper's orders.

1778
01:43:44,183 --> 01:43:47,863
Now Bharat Lal is officially alive.

1779
01:43:50,703 --> 01:43:54,303
- Long live...
- Bharat Lal.

1780
01:43:54,383 --> 01:43:57,103
- Long live...
- Bharat Lal.

1781
01:43:57,183 --> 01:44:02,263
- Long live...
- Bharat Lal.

1782
01:44:02,343 --> 01:44:05,343
Bharat Lal, son Kanhaiya Lal.

1783
01:44:06,543 --> 01:44:10,863
Village; Amilo, District Mubarakpur...

1784
01:44:11,903 --> 01:44:13,663
...is declared alive...

1785
01:44:15,063 --> 01:44:20,583
...through official orders.

1786
01:44:22,023 --> 01:44:25,783
For conspiring against him...

1787
01:44:27,103 --> 01:44:29,663
...and declaring
him dead unofficially...

1788
01:44:31,503 --> 01:44:33,103
...record keeper Bhure Singh...

1789
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:37,863
...Bharat Lal's uncle-aunty...

1790
01:45:02,143 --> 01:45:05,183
- Glory to...
- All India Association for Dead People

1791
01:45:05,263 --> 01:45:08,623
- Glory to...
- All India Association for Dead People

1792
01:45:16,223 --> 01:45:18,263
I am alive again.

1793
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:28,023
See I told you a piece of paper
cannot take your father from you.

1794
01:45:29,103 --> 01:45:30,387
Kaagaz (Paper)!

1795
01:45:30,743 --> 01:45:33,143
Sometimes as newspaper
and even as letters.

1796
01:45:33,663 --> 01:45:35,903
A necessity day in and day out.

1797
01:45:36,263 --> 01:45:38,543
A luxury that let's us come and go.

1798
01:45:38,823 --> 01:45:40,983
And order that decides
whether we live or die.

1799
01:45:41,463 --> 01:45:43,703
love letters are also of paper.

1800
01:45:43,983 --> 01:45:45,863
Even applications are made of paper.

1801
01:45:46,263 --> 01:45:48,423
Even flags made of papers

1802
01:45:48,783 --> 01:45:50,623
Even the body is made of paper.

1803
01:45:51,023 --> 01:45:53,263
Papers are witness to relations.

1804
01:45:53,543 --> 01:45:55,823
Be it wedding or a marriage.

1805
01:45:56,023 --> 01:45:57,903
Even the witness to a sin like divorce.

1806
01:45:58,143 --> 01:46:00,263
Papers can make or break.

1807
01:46:00,543 --> 01:46:02,783
Can snatch away you land and homes.

1808
01:46:02,943 --> 01:46:04,903
And wipe your tears too.

1809
01:46:04,983 --> 01:46:08,223
Papers are so important everywhere...

1810
01:46:08,463 --> 01:46:11,623
...like humans are made of paper.

1811
01:46:11,863 --> 01:46:14,623
Means nothing,
and still means everything.

1812
01:46:14,943 --> 01:46:17,423
That is the uniqueness of paper.

1813
01:46:23,263 --> 01:46:27,863
"Troubling was hovering over you.."

1814
01:46:27,943 --> 01:46:30,783
"...but you never gave up."

1815
01:46:30,863 --> 01:46:34,063
"Time was unfair with you."

1816
01:46:34,143 --> 01:46:39,503
"But you treaded on."

1817
01:46:39,663 --> 01:46:43,583
"The tide was against you..."

1818
01:46:43,663 --> 01:46:44,503
Forgive us, son.

1819
01:46:44,583 --> 01:46:47,543
- No need to apologize.
- Forgive me...

1820
01:46:47,623 --> 01:46:49,303
If you hadn't killed me on paper...

1821
01:46:49,383 --> 01:46:51,943
...I would've never
understood the value of life.

1822
01:46:53,303 --> 01:46:56,703
Return Bharat's land to him.

1823
01:46:56,783 --> 01:46:57,663
We already did.

1824
01:46:57,743 --> 01:47:00,783
Aunty, I don't want the land.
I got much more.

1825
01:47:00,863 --> 01:47:02,143
Forgive us, son.

1826
01:47:02,223 --> 01:47:03,863
Be happy, aunty.

1827
01:47:03,983 --> 01:47:04,983
I forgive you.

1828
01:47:05,063 --> 01:47:06,783
What a wonderful man.

1829
01:47:06,903 --> 01:47:09,863
- Goodbye. Come, aunty.
- I'll see you later.

1830
01:47:10,183 --> 01:47:11,543
Bharat Lal,

1831
01:47:11,823 --> 01:47:13,903
you've been proven alive on paper.

1832
01:47:14,263 --> 01:47:15,703
But what about us?

1833
01:47:15,783 --> 01:47:17,263
Yes, what about us.

1834
01:47:17,343 --> 01:47:20,783
Basheshar, the world is an arena.

1835
01:47:22,943 --> 01:47:26,343
Where truth and lies are
contending against each other.

1836
01:47:27,383 --> 01:47:34,463
As long as truth triumphs over lies...

1837
01:47:35,783 --> 01:47:37,503
...this war will continue.

1838
01:47:38,023 --> 01:47:41,583
- Glory to...
- All India Association for Dead People

1839
01:47:41,663 --> 01:47:44,823
- Glory to...
- All India Association for Dead People

1840
01:47:52,263 --> 01:47:55,543
"Leave a few breath in me..."

1841
01:47:55,663 --> 01:47:58,863
"...as I still have hope in me."

1842
01:47:58,943 --> 01:48:04,423
"I still have a lot to give."

1843
01:48:05,343 --> 01:48:08,743
"The destination is still pining."

1844
01:48:08,823 --> 01:48:11,983
"My heart's not given up to pray."

1845
01:48:12,063 --> 01:48:17,303
"I still have to face
a new challenge."

1846
01:48:18,383 --> 01:48:24,823
"Rise up again after
you fall and be strong."

1847
01:48:25,223 --> 01:48:31,823
"Gather the straws to make
a bridge and go across."

1848
01:48:34,943 --> 01:48:38,383
"May you live long..."

1849
01:48:38,463 --> 01:48:41,623
"May you live long..."

1850
01:48:41,703 --> 01:48:46,943
"May you live long...brother..."

1851
01:48:48,183 --> 01:48:51,543
"May you live long..."

1852
01:48:51,623 --> 01:48:54,783
"May you live long..."

1853
01:48:54,863 --> 01:48:59,783
"May you live long...brother..."
