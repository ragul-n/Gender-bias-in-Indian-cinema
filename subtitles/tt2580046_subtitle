Hey, that's enough,
what's gotten into you, kids?

122
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:10,310
Aren't you ashamed
to lash out on Santa Claus?

00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:12,481
This young man is right.

124
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:13,987

125
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:15,786

126
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,382

Sorry sir, is everything alright?

129
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,753
Don't worry,
I'm an old tough Santa Claus.

130
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:27,489
But, and you?
What are you doing out a this time?

131
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,354
Did you get lost?

132
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:33,169
Dressed like this, you must be cold.

133
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:34,662
Do you want a cup of
hot chocolate?

134
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:35,805
I have some left.

135
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:37,251
With pleasure, sir.

136
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,687
There's nothing better.

137
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:41,139
Except maybe, a piece of camembert...

138
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:44,600
You're lucky, kid, I have some left from my lunch sandwich.

139
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:47,382
I've never had one with such a strong smell.

140
00:07:48,262 --> 00:07:49,690

142
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,220
You're not lost?

143
00:07:58,536 --> 00:08:00,613
 It's my first Christmas
without my mother, sir.

144
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:01,709
My father, he...

145
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,084
He doesn't know how to deal with it.

146
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,120
I understand, you know.

147
00:08:05,664 --> 00:08:07,774
But your father must be
wondering where you are.

148
00:08:07,908 --> 00:08:09,908
And worrying a lot about you.

149
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:12,809
Now that you got some fresh air
and thought a bit...

150
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,114
Don't you think it'd be good
to go back home?

151
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:16,590
You're right sir.

152
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:20,407
That's good.  A family reunited under
the tree, that's the spirit of Christmas.

00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:06,129
Footprints...

179
00:10:11,014 --> 00:10:13,472
And you, sir?  Where are you going to
celebrate Christmas?

180
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:15,750
Me?  Well, everywhere in Paris.

181
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:17,172
The entire world, even.

182
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:19,891
You're all alone, huh?

183
00:10:20,617 --> 00:10:22,315
Listen, here's what we're gonna do.

184
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,359
Get me back and
stay at our place for dinner.

185
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:26,738
Help me bring back the
Christmas spirit, sir.

186
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,600
Well, Okay, but I won't be able to stay long.

187
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,649
It's that I have a lot of work
on Christmas Eve.

188
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,096
Thanks, Santa.

189
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:41,955
Adrien?
It's you?

190
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:43,101
And you, who are you?

191
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:44,284
Well, it's obvious, no?

192
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,678
I'm Santa Claus.

193
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:46,639
Of course.

194
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:47,990
And me, I'm the Easter Bunny.

195
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:50,106
Aren't you ashamed to bother us
on Christmas Eve?

196
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:51,727
Get lost or I'll send by bodyguard.

197
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:52,966
Father, you're mistaken.

198
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:54,013
No, he's right.

199
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:55,355
Your father saw through his plans.

200
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,737
This man is a supervillain
under the Papillon's hold.

201
00:10:57,762 --> 00:10:58,761
Wh-What?

202
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:00,701
You've all lost your minds.

203
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:02,857
No, Ladybug.

204
00:11:02,882 --> 00:11:04,872
Stop!  This man isn't akumatized.

205
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,665
I know how to recognize an akumatized.

206
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,022
Trust me.

207
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,891
Go back home, it's safer.

208
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,328
No, wait.

209
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:15,260
Adrien.
Plagg.

210
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:20,251
Go ponies, hup hup!

211
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:26,878
Are you crazy,
what's gotten in to you?

212
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:32,699
Without realizing it, you just gave me
a wonderful Christmas present, Ladybug.

213
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:35,300
A poor innocent wrongly accused.

214
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:37,439
And the spirit of a scorned holiday.

215
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:43,710
It's all my akuma needs...

216
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:46,215
...to darken this heart.

217
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:54,069
Adrien?  Where are you going?

218
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:55,355
To my room, of course.

219
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,247
Since my father doesn't want to celebrate Christmas.

220
00:11:57,272 --> 00:11:58,138
You're wrong.

221
00:11:58,163 --> 00:12:00,642
Your father came to see you,
but you were out.

222
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:02,215
I'll tell him you're waiting for him.

223
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,485
But this time, we'll make sure
you stay in your room.

224
00:12:08,414 --> 00:12:09,018
You-

225
00:12:09,114 --> 00:12:10,941
You aren't a supervillain?

226
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:12,260
Of course not.

227
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:15,150
You read too many superhero stories, my dear.

228
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:16,416
I'm sorry,

229
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,564
I really thought-

230
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:18,786
Don't touch me.

231
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:20,397
You've done enough as it is.

232
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:31,985
No one respects
the spirit of Christmas now days.

233
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,526
They don't believe in me anymore.

234
00:12:37,498 --> 00:12:39,339
I believe in you.

235
00:12:39,622 --> 00:12:42,453
My dear Bother Christmas,
I am the Papillon.

236
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:45,447
They wrongly accused you of
being a supervillain.

237
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:48,093
In that case,
that's what you'll be from now on.

238
00:12:48,118 --> 00:12:51,194
In return, since I was good all year,

239
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:54,051
I'll ask for not one, but two presents.

240
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:57,012
Ladybug and Chat Noir's Miraculouses.

241
00:12:57,165 --> 00:12:59,213
And you'll have them.

242
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:02,114
Merry Christmas to you, Papillon.

243
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:12,240
Ladybug!

Don't worry, Adrien.

257

I won't do anything to you.
I owe you.

258
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:18,111
You gave me a gift
and I won't forget it.

259
00:14:18,136 --> 00:14:20,449
On the contrary,
I'll avenge you, even.

260
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:22,136
Avenge us both.

261
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,128
No, wait!

262
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:26,035
It'll be the revenge Christmas.

263
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:32,051
Plagg, transform me.

264
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:36,030
It looks like Santa Claus came by,
my dear Chloe.

265
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:40,186

You and us, My Lady.

273
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:13,881
Chat Noir?

274
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:14,832
Where were you?

275
00:15:14,857 --> 00:15:16,051
And what happened to Adrien?

276
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:16,848
It's...

277
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:18,071
It's a long story.

278
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:19,928
Cats have their little secrets too.

279
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:26,283
Who's gonna deliver the kids their presents
to night, Bother Christmas?

280
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:28,133
All that is ancient history.

281
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:30,155
Farewell presents and Christmas spirit.

282
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,255
You should have been nice.

283
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,044
I was nice all year.

284
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:35,530
Obviously not enough.

285
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:39,753
I got you.

286
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:47,288
How about a little ride in the sledge,
little elves?

287
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:49,725
Hang on tight!

288
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,766
Here we go!

289
00:15:56,297 --> 00:15:58,531
It's not like that he'll get his sledge license.

290
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:05,249
It's time to open your presents, kids.

291
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:07,648
I'll take care of the sledge.

292
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:08,808
I'll leave Santa to you.

293
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:24,851
Whoa, easy there.

294
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:31,173
Thank you so much.

295
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:33,127
Ladybug!

296
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,897
It's happening again.

297
00:16:44,357 --> 00:16:46,008
Ladybug?  Chat Noir?

298
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:47,452
That's one Christmas scoop.

299
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:49,225
A little word for my Ladyblog?

300
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,632
Oh, erm, no no, it's not what it looks like.

301
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,768
No, wait.

302
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:56,625
I have another idea.

303
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,510
Lucky Charm!

304
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:05,697
Oh, top notch.

305
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:07,435
With that, for sure,
it's in the box.

306
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:11,698
I'm gonna need tape, scissors,
that kind of stuff.

307
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:12,627
You have that here?

308
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:13,670
Up there.

309
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:18,751
Here too.

310
00:17:22,243 --> 00:17:22,783
Here.

311
00:17:25,115 --> 00:17:26,298
My Christmas list.

312
00:17:26,322 --> 00:17:28,642
Run by the Dupain-Cheng bakery
and bring me this.

313
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,032
We'll meet at the Eiffel Tower.

314
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:31,010
I'll explain everything there.

315
00:17:31,035 --> 00:17:33,672
I've always dreamed of being your Santa.

316
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:36,601
Don't worry.

317
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:38,085
Everything will go back to before.

318
00:17:39,446 --> 00:17:41,039
Good luck, Ladybells.

319
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,695

We'll see next year who
will have the best presents.

348
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:55,833
Adrien.

349
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,754
I can't accept you disappearing too.

350
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:00,991
I couldn't bear losing you.

351
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:08,506
You have visitors.

352
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:15,590
I took the liberty of informing them
that Adrien was safe and sound, sir.

353
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,199
They were worried for their friend.

354
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:22,705
Please, Father, it's... it's Christmas spirit.

355
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:24,122
Very well.

356
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:25,162
Come in.

357
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:29,725
Merry Christmas, Adrien.

358
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:35,813
♪ Merry Christmas to all.

359
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,819
Merry Christmas, mom.
