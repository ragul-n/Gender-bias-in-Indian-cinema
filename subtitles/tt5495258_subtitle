2
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:31,793
Same pills
Continue the dose

3
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:33,137
Come after 3 months

4
00:03:33,262 --> 00:03:35,345
Same pills
Continue the dose

5
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,851
Come after 3 months

6
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,707
Only solution for diabetes

7
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,750
Control your taste buds

8
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:45,803
Sonny, is this the Assembly
or our Parliament?

9
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:48,003
Yawning as if you haven't
slept for a decade!

10
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,270
My son has a huge problem, doctor

11
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,732
Just tell me the problem

12
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:55,549
I'll decide if it is serious or small

13
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,178
Go on, tell him

14
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:14,595
Can't stand it any longer
Don't utter a single word

15
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:17,345
Remove your ID card

16
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:18,470
And exit right away

17
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,387
'The End' of Mr Yawn, huh?

18
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:34,862
How weird can they be!

19
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:37,262
They sacked me
because I yawned!

20
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:38,433
Let's drink coffee

21
00:04:38,504 --> 00:04:41,920
Hello! You and I
can never get along

22
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,637
Because I lost my job, huh?

23
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,990
Think what you want

24
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:53,678
Why this sudden somersault?

25
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:55,947
I told you, it won't work out

26
00:04:55,972 --> 00:04:57,055
But why?

27
00:04:57,595 --> 00:05:00,095
Because you keep yawning

28
00:05:04,423 --> 00:05:05,631
You can go

29
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,314
What do you mean 'okay'?

30
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:09,278
You shouldn't follow me hereafter

31
00:05:09,303 --> 00:05:10,553
You shouldn't call me

32
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:13,012
Even if you see me
you shouldn't talk to me

33
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:16,512
That is the meaning of
'it won't work out'

34
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:18,512
You already said it
You can go

35
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,053
Won't work out it seems

36
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,767
I guessed it when you hogged
the pizza all to yourself

37
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:29,017
You ditched me, right?
You can go

38
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,070
All because of this yawn
your dignity went for a toss

39
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:35,678
It is all due to stress

40
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,703
For a few days
forget everything

41
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:39,970
Have a blast with your friends

42
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:41,095
Definitely, doctor

43
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,777
"She ditched me badly
She walked away gladly"

44
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:08,361
"Blindfolding me on a knife's periphery
she twirled me into a life of misery"

45
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,878
"Shock wave in her caress
She left me blanked in darkness"

46
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,012
"Gawd! My head's bursting in dizziness"

47
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:23,862
"Grief chokes my throat, speechless"

48
00:06:24,015 --> 00:06:27,223
"She torpedoed like a tornado into me"

49
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:30,621
"Thoughts of her made me
weep endlessly"

50
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:33,854
"She blasted her way
into my heart explosively"

51
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:37,220
"Images of her made me
lament uncontrollably"

52
00:06:37,303 --> 00:06:40,762
"Arrow struck my heart headily
Without her, I'm in pain profusely"

53
00:06:40,803 --> 00:06:47,095
"Why this love symbol of an arrow?
Fling aside this crossbow"

54
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:50,887
"She torpedoed like a tornado into me"

55
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,470
"Thoughts of her made me cry terribly"

56
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:57,803
"She blasted her way into my heart boldly"

57
00:06:57,887 --> 00:07:01,178
"Memories of her made me
lament miserably"

58
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,887
"Love can electrocute
So said a scientist, dude"

59
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,137
"But the power went phut
I was buried in a blackout"

60
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,553
"Many a girl will be ready
to sacrifice her life, buddy"

61
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:55,970
"But I dug my own grave
Fell flat on my face"

62
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:59,595
"This is the Pakistan border
To be nailed is the order"

63
00:07:59,637 --> 00:08:02,928
"I got no warning from her"

64
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,220
"She erected in my eyes
my tombstone to my surprise"

65
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:09,720
"I opened my eyes and God help me
I was a corpse taken to the cemetery"

66
00:08:09,803 --> 00:08:13,178
"She drags me, tramples me
Buries me with frenzied fury"

67
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,512
"She invaded my soul
My heart lost control"

68
00:08:16,553 --> 00:08:19,970
"She made me whine and weep"

69
00:08:20,012 --> 00:08:23,303
"She stabbed my heart real deep"

70
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:26,887
"Memories of her made me
lament in misery"

71
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:32,053
"She ditched me callously
She walked away casually"

72
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:38,595
"Blindfolding me on a knife's periphery
she swirled me into a life of misery"

73
00:08:44,012 --> 00:08:47,512
"God should open His eyes anew
He should get a girlfriend too"

74
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:54,095
"Then he'll know the hell we go through
His 'making' will be less faulty, dude"

75
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:56,012
"She blasted
Lambasted"

76
00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:57,803
"She stamped
And trampled"

77
00:08:57,845 --> 00:08:59,512
"She ripped apart
Soul and heart"

78
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:01,178
"Pounding heavily
she wounded me"

79
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:04,545
"She torpedoed like a tornado with fury"

80
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,862
"Thoughts of her made me weep dreary"

81
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:11,262
"She hounded me
Mind and body"

82
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:14,887
"Images of her made me
lament uncontrollably"

83
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:20,113
"Damn her!"

84
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,535
"Bother"

85
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:26,178
"Royal pain!"

86
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:30,946
"My love is in vain"

87
00:09:33,191 --> 00:09:35,615
Master, you know what?

88
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:36,320
What?

89
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,751
Those who puff too many cigarettes
won't be able to taste anything it seems

90
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:41,070
According to researchers

91
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:42,801
Is that a fact?

92
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:43,903
Don't believe me?

93
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:47,845
Look how he is relishing
this god-awful tea!

94
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:51,639
Master, jobless fellows will talk
like G.D.Naidu, Edison of India!

95
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:53,070
Correct, Computer!

96
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:55,033
First, look into your own self

97
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:56,849
Then find faults in others

98
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,023
As if your words
will earn an advance?

99
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:02,090
Look! I've got a team leader
in place now

100
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:04,153
How old is she?

101
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,737
I've got the right person
for your work

102
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:08,070
You want the job or not?

103
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:10,070
Look! That fellow has
snatched aunty's bag

104
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:11,445
Catch him...thief!

105
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,237
Master, the time is ripe
for me to become a hero

106
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,182
I'll nab the thief
I will hit him-

107
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:22,195
And catch a place
in that girl's heart

108
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:26,066
Hey!

109
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:28,277
At least take a look at the girl

110
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:30,534
Ask her to wait
First I'll get her bag

111
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:32,514
Mojo has got a lottery!

112
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:33,931
You missed it, Sanjeevi

113
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:35,737
She must be some
two-bit crappy piec-

114
00:10:35,778 --> 00:10:36,945
So-so, huh?

115
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:47,843
This is a crappy piece?

116
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:51,705
This is a chocolate piece!

117
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:55,987
She is as fair as pure milk
not diluted with water!

118
00:10:58,695 --> 00:10:59,987
You don't worry, dear

119
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,445
I'll catch the thief
and get your bag

120
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,269
Grandpa, it's okay

121
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:05,653
Grand-

122
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:07,237
Lech old man

123
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,320
Why is she leaving
without her bag?

124
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:19,865
You're back limping like
the old hag in the film Kanchana?

125
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,148
You got her bag?

126
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,640
She left ages ago

127
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:26,692
Vanished, huh?!

128
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:28,733
How did she look?
Describe her to me

129
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:29,733
Kind of fair

130
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:30,842
Fair...wow!

131
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,820
White as flour

132
00:11:32,987 --> 00:11:34,195
Like flour?

133
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,070
Kind of yellowish tinge

134
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:40,627
Yama's yellow

135
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:42,153
Lemon yellow?

136
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:46,945
If you want the exact color
kind of...like wheat

137
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,086
This love starved idiot will jump
in joy even for the ugliest duckling

138
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:56,986
Aunty couldn't stand for too long
That's why she left

139
00:11:57,153 --> 00:11:58,112
Middle-aged, huh?

140
00:11:58,153 --> 00:11:59,153
Exactly

141
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:01,195
My hero-fight was all a waste

142
00:12:02,343 --> 00:12:03,260
What are you doing?

143
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:04,653
You said she's middle aged

144
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:05,695
Let's split 50-50

145
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,595
Isn't it wrong?

146
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,120
It's wrong even to befriend you

147
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,244
You want or don't want?

148
00:12:09,403 --> 00:12:10,070
Want...want

149
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:10,903
Then keep quiet

150
00:12:11,015 --> 00:12:12,723
Aunty will have
a fat wad of cash insid-

151
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:15,653
Booze, cigarette, betel nut powder

152
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,070
Yawn away!

153
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:21,206
She is an 'accused' aunt

154
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:27,945
Must be a regular booze-pot

155
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,070
Booze-pot

156
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:32,695
My analysis is...

157
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:35,070
...this aunt must be
guzzling away to glory

158
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:41,862
…with a 50p pickle
dabbed on to her tongue

159
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:45,070
When the spice hits her
she will be dancing on her toes

160
00:12:45,153 --> 00:12:48,070
Then this 'accused' aunty
will light a cigarette

161
00:12:48,320 --> 00:15:53,890


162
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:53,067
On a complete 'high'
she'll open the betel nut packet

163
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:54,509
And empty it all into her mouth

164
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:57,117
She will chew it
to her teeth's content!

165
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,822
She will spit it a mile away

166
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:00,897
Ugh!

167
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:13,213
You're walking so piously
like you're inside a temple

168
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:15,184
You are my temple, sir

169
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:17,292
Will this humility last
till the very end?

170
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,225
Will you employ me lifelong?

171
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,541
Why entertain such a doubt?

172
00:13:20,644 --> 00:13:22,227
You were not picked just like that

173
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:23,991
In your eyes
I saw a gleam

174
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:25,807
Your face is vivacious
to the extreme

175
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,489
Your body has a zing
and zeal supreme

176
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:28,930
Whatever I lack...

177
00:13:29,597 --> 00:13:31,514
...you have it all, 101%

178
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:35,112
I'm sure with your hard work...

179
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:38,737
...all our projects will
take off with flying colo-

180
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,987
What an opening
early in the morning!

181
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:46,679
This is your cabin
Take your seat

182
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:48,560
How can I sit in front of you?
It's disrespectful!

183
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:51,294
Will you be ironing clothes
standing and working full time?

184
00:13:51,426 --> 00:13:53,676
Software
You need to sit to work

185
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,799
Go to your seat

186
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,791
The air conditioner is turned
full blast at me

187
00:13:58,898 --> 00:13:59,898
That's how it will be

188
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,256
Yawning like a cave opening
on your 1st day at work

189
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:20,552
Where is the canteen?

190
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:22,978
That’s enough

191
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:25,732
They stick a slice of onion in a bun
and make us pay 150 bucks

192
00:14:25,757 --> 00:14:27,090
And they call it burger!

193
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:31,362
It has been just 1 hour
since you joined duty

194
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:32,888
And you're sitting here hogging

195
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:33,721
- Come here
- What?

196
00:14:37,653 --> 00:14:39,320
Look at that chick over there

197
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:41,362
She's that booze-pot

198
00:14:42,987 --> 00:14:44,612
That bag with booze

199
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:45,653
Cigarette

200
00:14:45,737 --> 00:14:46,778
Betel nut powder

201
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,195
All that crap we found
inside her bag

202
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:50,153
Ditto!

203
00:14:50,195 --> 00:14:51,487
She is that booze-pot

204
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,249
Who is 'booze-pot', boss?

205
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:55,112
That whacko female over there

206
00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:56,153
'Shut up'

207
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,070
Oh! Nice nick-name

208
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:01,195
Why did you-

209
00:15:01,237 --> 00:15:02,487
Hope she doesn't snitch!

210
00:15:02,512 --> 00:15:04,970
Why did you tell me
she was an aunty then?

211
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:06,936
I told you the truth now, right?

212
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:08,170
Go and try your luck

213
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:09,362
Sheer waste

214
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:12,278
You are branding her as 'waste'?

215
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,862
Can you go near her?

216
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:14,987
No way

217
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,987
So why waste time
is what I meant

218
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:19,753
I can even control my anger

219
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:20,653
But not this urge

220
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:21,570
Uncle...wait

221
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:23,278
Don't go there
I'm warning you

222
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,536
They are on a dunking-spree

223
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,495
I am a booze-pro

224
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,973
You are done for

225
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,278
I can't hold it any longer

226
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:31,804
I'll burst if I wait any longer

227
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:32,890
Thank Go-

228
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:34,290
Dude...!

229
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:37,989
I won't

230
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,862
We won't either!

231
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,195
You can go

232
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:47,153
So can you

233
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:48,862
You've given permission?

234
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:50,653
Go home

235
00:16:51,362 --> 00:16:53,112
Home, huh!

236
00:16:55,153 --> 00:16:58,570
Gawd! Can't bear this torture

237
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,778
Coast is clear

238
00:17:03,153 --> 00:17:05,153
Aiyo! Bad penny back again

239
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:09,612
I thought my tank burst!

240
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,362
Shall I pee here?

241
00:17:19,111 --> 00:17:21,152
Following me like a shadow

242
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,778
Try spraying now

243
00:17:26,017 --> 00:17:28,142
Only place where I won't be hounded

244
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:41,153
Empty your entire tank load
of water in here

245
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:43,087
It is stinking to high heaven!

246
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:45,987
Their sense of social service
is all screwed up!

247
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:55,782
How are you, Sunitha?

248
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:57,140
- I’m good
- Okay, see you

249
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,362
Subbaiya anna, should I
repeat this dialog daily to you?

250
00:18:00,585 --> 00:18:03,287
Will you keep your booze bottle
only on top of the electricity box?

251
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:04,770
Sorry, I forgot to trash it

252
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,570
You have grown up daughters

253
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:11,862
You should at least live to see them
happily married and become a grandpa

254
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:13,714
I want to let go
of this disgusting habit

255
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:14,989
But I am unable to

256
00:18:15,014 --> 00:18:16,639
To forget one habit...

257
00:18:16,737 --> 00:18:18,778
...here is another one

258
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:22,570
Drink this grape juice today

259
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:28,083
If I drink from any other bottle
I'll have withdrawal symptoms

260
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:30,180
Is that so?

261
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:32,075
Then I'll pour this
into your own bottle

262
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:33,254
You can drink

263
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:35,945
Here you go...drink

264
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:39,962
Why?
Stinking, huh?

265
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:41,695
There isn't any stink at all

266
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:44,045
- Helmet...I'll be back
- I'll give you an idea

267
00:18:44,086 --> 00:18:46,878
Hold your nose
and drink in 1 shot

268
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:48,778
If you want
I can drink along with you

269
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,070
I'll puke

270
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,254
You'll be fine
You must drink this

271
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:55,753
Sitting with the security guy
and drinking in broad daylight

272
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:56,862
What are you doing here?

273
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:57,945
Thanks for asking, bro

274
00:18:57,987 --> 00:19:00,112
He isn't inclined
Why are you compelling him?

275
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:02,045
Did I give him poison or what?

276
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,487
Whether it is poison or nectar
he doesn't want to drink it

277
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,862
Then why brainwash him?

278
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:08,327
Thank God you came like God
in the nick of time, bro

279
00:19:08,352 --> 00:19:11,644
Yov! I should hit myself
for making you drink this

280
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:14,487
Bro, leave it to me
I'll handle it

281
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,278
Poor fellow! You are trying
to spoil a family man

282
00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:19,587
You think a security guy
can be taken for a ride?

283
00:19:19,612 --> 00:19:20,653
Night and day he has-

284
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:21,778
Yes, night and day!

285
00:19:21,803 --> 00:19:23,136
He has toiled 24x7

286
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,577
Hey! Don't let your tongue run

287
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:28,653
Bro, swear you won't drink
this disgusting stuff ever

288
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:30,070
I swear on this girl

289
00:19:30,112 --> 00:19:32,028
I won't drink THIS stuff
ever again in my life

290
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,195
Shake hands

291
00:19:33,278 --> 00:19:36,487
You'll be answerable
to someone one day

292
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:47,026
Just like we expected...

293
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:49,639
...we got a groom from USA
We are so happy about it

294
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:52,067
Will you have something to drink?

295
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,078
Coffee is ready

296
00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:55,478
Do you take coffee with sugar?

297
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:57,859
Few teaspoons extra

298
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,952
I like it very sweet

299
00:20:10,746 --> 00:20:11,996
This is my daughter Joshna

300
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:15,471
Quite a fashionable name!

301
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:24,234
'What is she saying?'

302
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:29,742
What is this man saying now?

303
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:35,192
She will sing from
inside a well it seems

304
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,859
You don't have to sing
from within a well

305
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:39,859
Sing right here

306
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:42,859
Don't make a fuss

307
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:47,276
Step out
1 minute

308
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:52,651
- Punch him on his face
- Why are you hitting me?

309
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:54,526
Just 1 minute
Come out

310
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:55,901
What's the problem?

311
00:20:57,484 --> 00:20:58,401
Give me a minute

312
00:20:58,442 --> 00:20:59,859
No problem

313
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,022
What's the problem?

314
00:21:03,085 --> 00:21:04,692
Do you know who is
sitting in your hall?

315
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:06,151
- My son-in-law to be
- My foot!

316
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:08,801
Rowdies have got your groom-to-be
in their clutches out there

317
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,109
This impersonator is Guna

318
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,137
Coffee for you, dear

319
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:13,162
Shut up and go in

320
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,401
Such a pain!

321
00:21:14,484 --> 00:21:15,484
Forever stressed out

322
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:16,776
You want me to spell it out

323
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:19,760
Cooling glass Guna who is wanted
for 12 murders is sitting in there

324
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:21,609
Beat him to a pulp

325
00:21:29,626 --> 00:21:32,834
The minister sent his men
asking me to sign a document

326
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:33,984
I refused to sign

327
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,692
Sign or else you'll be
in the cemetery by design!

328
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:37,859
Watch your back

329
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:44,192
Guna...?

330
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:46,776
Found out, huh?

331
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:48,635
Leave this place right now

332
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:51,442
Am I your groom from USA
to go when you snap your fingers?

333
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:56,401
Look at that! Even your daughter
has given the green signal

334
00:21:56,442 --> 00:21:58,359
Do you think
you are being fair?

335
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,401
To be fair and just...

336
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:01,817
...am I a hero?

337
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:03,942
Villain!

338
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:06,359
Go...go

339
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:07,859
All the files are in the car

340
00:22:07,942 --> 00:22:09,401
Be a good boy and sign

341
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:12,109
You sing, dear

342
00:22:24,484 --> 00:22:25,859
Shall we leave?

343
00:22:26,276 --> 00:22:27,776
It's a lovely song

344
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:53,859
I've agreed to sign
Don't hit him

345
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:57,151
Why are you crying?

346
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:00,401
She sang of mother's love
so sentimentally

347
00:23:01,192 --> 00:23:02,026
When?

348
00:23:02,568 --> 00:23:04,735
4th line in the song

349
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:06,192
That's why

350
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:07,984
She's a nightingale

351
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:09,609
Did you like my song?

352
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:13,734
What is Kamal Haasan's daughter's name?

353
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:14,442
Shruti

354
00:23:14,534 --> 00:23:16,826
Your pitch and intonation
I mean the 'shruti' was super

355
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:19,109
Especially the 4th line
loaded with mother sentiment

356
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:21,677
- That was too good
- That was my comment!

357
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:22,744
Excellent

358
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:26,776
Guna, I signed
Will you leave now?

359
00:23:26,801 --> 00:23:28,926
Daddy, don't disturb us now

360
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:30,567
Joshna, you go in

361
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:34,776
Guna...?

362
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:40,776
Get lost now

363
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:26,734
Why are you yawning
when you are at work?

364
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:29,359
Verify this project

365
00:24:30,984 --> 00:24:32,609
- Sanjeevi?
- Sir...?

366
00:24:32,817 --> 00:24:36,776
Finish that banking project
along with Sunitha

367
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,067
Sir...sir, I don't want
to work with her

368
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,692
Yesterday she was with-

369
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:44,817
She was with...?

370
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,442
She was drinking
with some chap, sir

371
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:48,401
Really?

372
00:24:49,891 --> 00:24:50,725
Prox!

373
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,167
Call Sunitha from the 4th floor

374
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:55,942
Is it really true?

375
00:24:56,192 --> 00:24:57,734
I swear on you, sir

376
00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:04,817
Sir, did you call me?

377
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:06,734
Ask her, sir

378
00:25:06,953 --> 00:25:09,828
Did you take a shot yesterday?

379
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:14,376
I did at first

380
00:25:14,401 --> 00:25:16,734
But my companion sucked big time

381
00:25:16,817 --> 00:25:20,276
So I called up and asked
the other boys to join

382
00:25:20,401 --> 00:25:21,942
Pisshead!

383
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:26,109
5 of them landed
So totally 6

384
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,359
Did you hear that?

385
00:25:27,553 --> 00:25:28,928
She had a blast
with 6 of them

386
00:25:28,953 --> 00:25:33,286
I was worried you might've been
'taking shots' all by yourself

387
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:35,551
Are you in your senses?

388
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,276
Why do you doubt
my state of mind?

389
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:40,717
Sunitha, come tomorrow
and just sign in

390
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:43,401
Then 'on duty' go on
a full splashing spree

391
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,067
Sir, how can you
encourage a girl like this?

392
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:48,276
She's so good at it
You can't hold a candle to her

393
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,526
I'm not a dipsomaniac, sir

394
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:53,109
Singlehanded she can
paint the town maroon!

395
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:56,709
Your parents let you
go scot free, huh?

396
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:58,651
At first they were hesitant

397
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:01,734
When I said they should take it
in the social spirit, they agreed

398
00:26:01,817 --> 00:26:08,401
Then they started prodding me
to do this more often

399
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,776
Specialty of this habit

400
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,817
Once you get into it
you are totally addicted

401
00:26:14,227 --> 00:26:15,734
Can she do this openly
in broad daylight?

402
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:16,859
What's wrong with him?

403
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,834
Everyone is doing this
out in the open, right?

404
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:20,234
So we also reciprocate openly

405
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,817
'Even-steven'

406
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:22,817
Understood?

407
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,484
How do you stand that stink?

408
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:27,067
Do I have a choice?

409
00:26:27,151 --> 00:26:29,276
The stink will make
our tummies somersault

410
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,417
We'll clamp our noses and that's it

411
00:26:31,442 --> 00:26:32,984
I'm lost for words
Disgusting!

412
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:36,151
You're better off being married
and made to cook night and day

413
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:39,526
You have such a cheap mentality

414
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:42,276
Male chauvinist
Is he in the dark ages?

415
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:44,209
Take him along with you tomorrow

416
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:46,167
Only then he will realize
your social spirit

417
00:26:46,192 --> 00:26:46,942
I can't do all that

418
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:48,401
Then you attend
to your project

419
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:50,109
We will take care
of this project

420
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,359
- Totally incapable
- When did you employ him?

421
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:53,984
'What is wrong with them?'

422
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:07,276
Hey! Yellow shirt

423
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,067
You will bequeath your house
to the man in the green shirt

424
00:27:10,151 --> 00:27:11,442
What is he saying?

425
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:14,717
Guna, Kittanna Vasu was the one
who called us to mediate here

426
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:17,209
Kittanna Vasu?

427
00:27:17,234 --> 00:27:19,567
The man in yellow shirt
is our candidate

428
00:27:20,526 --> 00:27:22,901
Hey! Green shirt

429
00:27:23,484 --> 00:27:26,942
Bequeath your house with the land
to the man in the yellow shirt

430
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:28,176
Yov! Saffron 'dhoti'

431
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:30,109
How dare you be disrespectful!

432
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:36,067
Guna, don't
He might die

433
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:37,484
I'll finish you
and your family

434
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:38,859
Don't talk impulsively

435
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:43,276
I'll pickle you to pieces

436
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:46,376
As and when you asked
we signed readily

437
00:27:46,455 --> 00:27:48,913
Now you want
the house we live in

438
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:52,502
Instead of giving your money
to rowdies ad politicians...

439
00:27:52,775 --> 00:27:55,859
...if you give it to your own brothers
at least we can be well settled in life

440
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:57,859
I'll give anyone else
But not you

441
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,692
All you have is our property

442
00:27:59,817 --> 00:28:01,484
But we are united

443
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:05,001
You've chosen the wrong way
That's why you keep wrong company

444
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,704
They are discussing
their family matter

445
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:07,437
Just ignore

446
00:28:07,462 --> 00:28:09,379
This family inheritance
is the dividing factor

447
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:10,529
We will bequeath it to you

448
00:28:10,554 --> 00:28:12,679
Let the next generation
not have this silly feud

449
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:15,079
You might want
to be generous

450
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,026
I won't sign

451
00:28:17,143 --> 00:28:19,518
Minister, if this brother's
death certificate is ready...

452
00:28:19,913 --> 00:28:21,303
...if one brother signs,
it will do, right?

453
00:28:21,328 --> 00:28:22,953
I need to die
for your plan to succeed

454
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,111
Don't worry about that

455
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,181
It is my profession

456
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:27,122
Resign yourself
to your death

457
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:31,251
Guna, give me a minute
Let me talk to him

458
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,234
Come here

459
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:36,710
How did you get all the property
except that single house in your name?

460
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:39,751
- What is your name?
- Kittana Vasu

461
00:28:39,776 --> 00:28:41,234
Grabber of the first order!

462
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:47,866
This is the last of
our hereditary assets

463
00:28:47,891 --> 00:28:49,808
We will hand over
the ownership to you

464
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:51,632
Can we trust you?

465
00:28:51,657 --> 00:28:52,490
Yes, sir

466
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:54,158
We can trust him it seems

467
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:04,876
Guna, the brothers signed
the property, right?

468
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:06,609
There is a slight hitch

469
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:09,167
They hid from us the fact
they have a younger sister

470
00:29:09,192 --> 00:29:11,400
When we asked them
they said she is possessed

471
00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:13,466
Only if she signs
the document is valid

472
00:29:13,562 --> 00:29:15,812
Only you can close the deal, Guna

473
00:29:20,871 --> 00:29:22,580
"Go, get them, tiger"

474
00:29:26,518 --> 00:29:28,351
"Way to go, partner"

475
00:29:43,526 --> 00:29:45,442
"Bro, kick them in their ass"

476
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,276
"Hit them hard, boss"

477
00:30:00,593 --> 00:30:02,135
Guna, don't

478
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:07,901
She has lost her mind, Guna

479
00:30:10,192 --> 00:30:11,734
Spare her today

480
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,567
I'll make her sign
sometime soon

481
00:30:13,592 --> 00:30:16,383
Are you enacting a drama
just to retain the property?

482
00:30:16,408 --> 00:30:17,658
Sign or else…!

483
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:24,484
Aren't you the one who
reduced me to this plight?

484
00:30:27,276 --> 00:30:28,859
Hey! Guna

485
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:32,192
Blind Guna

486
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:35,984
You got even my nickname right

487
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,901
Are you pretending
to be possessed?

488
00:30:37,984 --> 00:30:39,484
Come with me

489
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:41,859
I'll gouge your eyes out

490
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:42,984
Let go of me

491
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:44,276
You’re manhandling a lady

492
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,526
I'll slaughter you

493
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:48,484
You'll ask me to mediate
Then unite and try to get rid of me

494
00:30:48,651 --> 00:30:51,484
Are we twiddling
our thumbs or what?

495
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:53,859
Sign now

496
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:54,942
Give it to her

497
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,567
You have the gall to bite me!

498
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:22,370
Blood…blood

499
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:24,276
She's dead, bro

500
00:31:49,968 --> 00:31:52,093
How can they be sleeping
like this during working hours?

501
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:54,266
The entire office is
yawning or asleep

502
00:31:54,308 --> 00:31:56,016
Is the company
paying you for this?

503
00:31:56,387 --> 00:31:58,169
Deadlines for our projects
haven't been met at all

504
00:32:00,474 --> 00:32:02,099
Every second is money

505
00:32:02,473 --> 00:32:04,016
Same day, 50 people
have taken off

506
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:05,683
What reason will you come up with?

507
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:06,991
I'll check and get back

508
00:32:07,016 --> 00:32:09,391
Why should you check?
I'll show it to you

509
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:13,241
This was recorded last week

510
00:32:13,283 --> 00:32:15,616
Prior to this, they were
all on their toes

511
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:17,485
He switched all of them
into sleep mode

512
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,135
This footage is from yesterday

513
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:21,683
Want to watch
the current footage?

514
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:22,849
Take a look

515
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:25,266
He has made even the girls
snore and snooze!

516
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:27,224
How will I answer my clients?

517
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:30,124
Wonder who appointed him!

518
00:32:35,474 --> 00:32:36,516
Tell me, dear

519
00:32:37,516 --> 00:32:38,683
What...?

520
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:41,099
The pizza you ordered
hasn't been delivered?

521
00:32:41,141 --> 00:32:43,016
I'll check immediately

522
00:32:45,724 --> 00:32:47,683
She's another pain
in the wrong place!

523
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:49,558
What...?

524
00:32:50,465 --> 00:32:52,757
Pizza phone number is-

525
00:32:52,782 --> 00:32:54,699
How about solving my problem?

526
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,891
I'll find out why
and get back to you, sir

527
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,520
Aren't you ashamed to call
yourself a team leader?

528
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:07,016
Did you see this?

529
00:33:08,308 --> 00:33:10,016
Sleeping in pairs happily

530
00:33:10,516 --> 00:33:12,308
You are HR managers

531
00:33:12,495 --> 00:33:14,078
Aren't you the least bit ashamed?

532
00:33:15,772 --> 00:33:17,022
Who is this?

533
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:18,130
Who is this?

534
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,449
Sir, even I fell asleep

535
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:26,574
No wonder I wasn't able to
catch them when they dozed off

536
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,058
I'll smash your face

537
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:30,866
Do you know the culprit?

538
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:32,141
Look! He is the one

539
00:33:32,224 --> 00:33:34,808
Sole cause for all this chaos
and acting so damn innocent!

540
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:36,891
If I see him here again,
I'll fire you

541
00:33:48,063 --> 00:33:48,897
It's done

542
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:50,339
Okay, 'sweet pretzel'

543
00:33:53,938 --> 00:33:55,438
He yawns

544
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:59,110
So damn infectious, those who
see him yawn start yawning!

545
00:33:59,433 --> 00:34:02,724
It's like an epidemic
spreading through the entire office

546
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,987
I was working 24x7
as busy as an ant

547
00:34:06,012 --> 00:34:08,304
And he made me slip horizontal!

548
00:34:23,074 --> 00:34:25,145
Sir, why are you
looking so dull today?

549
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:26,940
Didn't you sleep last night?

550
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:32,991
Sorry, dude

551
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:35,116
Tried talking to
that 'retro lizard candy'

552
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,574
I believe if he doesn't fire you
he will be minus a job!

553
00:34:37,632 --> 00:34:39,466
Only after you joined duty...

554
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:41,866
... ...everyone here is yawning
and dozing off it seems

555
00:34:41,908 --> 00:34:44,908
Your boss called me
and even showed me the video

556
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:47,959
Same reason you were fired
in your previous office also, right?

557
00:34:47,984 --> 00:34:49,401
Something is wrong

558
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:51,683
Before it gets worse,
consult a good doctor

559
00:34:53,945 --> 00:34:56,445
Thanks...for getting me the job

560
00:35:00,195 --> 00:35:02,153
How can yawning be infectious?

561
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:13,308
'Good Lord!'

562
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:27,901
Reports seem very unusual

563
00:35:28,433 --> 00:35:32,224
Can an ordinary yawn
bring so many changes, doctor?

564
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,172
This is no ordinary yawn

565
00:35:36,683 --> 00:35:37,683
Take a look

566
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:39,099
In 2008...

567
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:41,891
...in South Korea
a girl named Sheemu

568
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:44,574
...yawned thrice a day

569
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,558
How can you
label that as a problem?

570
00:35:47,843 --> 00:35:49,176
Look at this one

571
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:16,224
Look how her yawn is making
everything fly helter-skelter!

572
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:22,683
What is this, doctor?

573
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:27,099
Look what happened when
the same girl yawned a 2nd time

574
00:36:28,183 --> 00:36:30,308
Look at her eyes
They slant to 1 side

575
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:33,308
Saw her lift her eyebrows?

576
00:36:34,034 --> 00:36:35,617
Look at her nose twitching now

577
00:36:35,742 --> 00:36:37,658
Her mouth is going wonky

578
00:36:37,683 --> 00:36:40,558
The problem starts
only after these symptoms

579
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:52,933
Doctor...?remove

580
00:36:53,782 --> 00:36:54,990
Should I get admitted?

581
00:36:55,015 --> 00:36:56,432
Any surgery required?

582
00:36:57,406 --> 00:37:00,156
He's doing a major
research on yawning

583
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,083
Be brave, relax

584
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:10,936
I imagined the worst
and was petrified

585
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:12,003
I'll inform my mother

586
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:18,926
Was this girl cured, doctor?

587
00:37:19,766 --> 00:37:21,933
Unfortunately that girl...

588
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,241
...few days after
she got this problem

589
00:37:24,461 --> 00:37:25,503
...passed away!

590
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,574
Look! He's still sleeping

591
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,558
It's late, wake up

592
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:39,016
Don't you have to
go for work?

593
00:37:39,058 --> 00:37:40,183
Hello...wake up

594
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,949
Something happened at work

595
00:37:41,974 --> 00:37:43,558
I'll tell you later
Let me sleep now

596
00:37:43,716 --> 00:37:45,300
We'll discuss all that
in the evening

597
00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:46,200
Get up now

598
00:38:10,347 --> 00:38:12,013
No civic sense at all

599
00:38:12,336 --> 00:38:14,294
No one is picking up the trash

600
00:38:16,605 --> 00:38:18,313
Someone has littered
on the walkway

601
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:27,808
You were too good

602
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:28,891
Who are you?

603
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,283
We represent
the Clean Country movement

604
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:35,651
If everyone thinks like you,
India will be squeaky clean!

605
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:37,856
What you did is praiseworthy

606
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:40,099
This milk sweet is
our token of appreciation

607
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:40,891
Why all this?

608
00:38:40,974 --> 00:38:42,849
Because you share
our 'clean' sentiments

609
00:38:42,891 --> 00:38:44,308
It's only for you
Go ahead, eat

610
00:38:51,241 --> 00:38:53,616
Will your grandpa come
to pick up this trash?

611
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:55,974
No, my wife will do it for me

612
00:38:58,808 --> 00:39:02,558
'Aww! If I pick this up,
he'll think I want to be his wife!'

613
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,864
Madam...trash

614
00:39:07,574 --> 00:39:08,949
I picked it up

615
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:10,224
Trash bin

616
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:12,074
I'm about to dump it

617
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:14,199
About to throw it

618
00:39:14,224 --> 00:39:15,474
Throwing it

619
00:39:15,617 --> 00:39:17,325
- Dropped it
- Bingo!

620
00:39:17,503 --> 00:39:18,836
Like him-

621
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:20,375
Milk sweet?

622
00:39:20,474 --> 00:39:22,599
'Milk sweet...?'

623
00:39:24,974 --> 00:39:26,891
- I'll be around
- Please be seated

624
00:39:27,141 --> 00:39:29,058
'How pathetic'

625
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:30,224
Milk sweet

626
00:39:32,905 --> 00:39:34,947
See that guy there
sitting on the bench?

627
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,533
Give him a milk sweet
and take a selfie

628
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:38,122
Alan, Ruby, come with me

629
00:39:38,622 --> 00:39:41,206
Sanjeevi is such a good fellow

630
00:39:41,594 --> 00:39:45,199
I can't believe you picked up
all this rubbish here

631
00:39:45,286 --> 00:39:47,578
Hello, what are you doing?

632
00:39:47,825 --> 00:39:49,308
He is the one
who picked up the trash

633
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:50,808
And he was the one
who littered

634
00:39:50,908 --> 00:39:52,991
Hey! Fraud, you didn't
pick up the trash?

635
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,891
If they gave it to you by mistake
you're happily relishing it

636
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:57,793
They gave it to me
So I accepted it

637
00:39:57,818 --> 00:39:59,985
You'll angle for any freebie
with your mouth open

638
00:40:00,088 --> 00:40:01,418
Give him a piece
of your mind

639
00:40:01,461 --> 00:40:02,419
My milk sweet?

640
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:04,166
What's this?
Aren't you ashamed?

641
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:05,666
This is too much

642
00:40:05,749 --> 00:40:07,416
What a build up
for a silly milk sweet!

643
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:09,166
You can take back
your milk sweet

644
00:40:09,597 --> 00:40:12,166
At least do your bit
for having gobbled our sweet

645
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,416
That's right

646
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:15,166
What work should I do?

647
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:16,791
He munched a whole packet

648
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:18,499
So get the maximum
work out of him

649
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,624
I'll take care

650
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:20,541
Milk sweet?

651
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:23,458
Get that Sanjeevi who ate
that milk sweet into the truck

652
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:26,124
What work?

653
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:30,741
Dumbass! Don't bang my face

654
00:40:31,624 --> 00:40:33,541
- Shall we go?
- I'm ready

655
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:38,458
Hello, what are you up to?

656
00:40:38,658 --> 00:40:41,366
On the way to this park
I picked up all the garbage

657
00:40:41,391 --> 00:40:43,474
I'm dumping all that
into the trash bin here

658
00:40:43,499 --> 00:40:45,833
Bloody drunkards!
Dumping it all over the place

659
00:40:46,084 --> 00:40:48,751
Why can't they swallow
the bloody booze bottle too?

660
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:51,416
'Did that bottle too find
 its way into her bag like this?'

661
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:56,541
'How could I have
misunderstood her!'

662
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:13,374
Hey! Minister is calling

663
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:15,958
Good day

664
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,666
Guna, won't you pipe down?

665
00:41:17,749 --> 00:41:20,666
I sent you to arbitrate a litigated property
 thinking I'll benefit

666
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:23,541
You've got into a new mess
and got involved in a murder case!

667
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,083
Let me tell you what happened

668
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:28,833
Electricity board people fixed
the current pole in the wrong place

669
00:41:29,308 --> 00:41:30,808
It was a very slight push

670
00:41:31,142 --> 00:41:32,900
But she banged against the pole
and got electrocuted

671
00:41:33,045 --> 00:41:35,087
As long as you aren't caught
you can be amused

672
00:41:35,145 --> 00:41:36,520
Police are looking for you

673
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:38,270
You are in your car now, right?

674
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,253
Yes

675
00:41:39,278 --> 00:41:41,361
First get down
from that damn car

676
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:43,808
Hide from the police
for a whole hour

677
00:41:43,973 --> 00:41:46,223
I'll get you the bail
within that time frame

678
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:34,981
Hello! He is throwing stones at me

679
00:42:35,006 --> 00:42:37,558
He's peeing in public and has
the gall to throw stones at you?

680
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:39,308
Hit him straight
on his head

681
00:42:39,465 --> 00:42:42,090
If you don't hit him hard
I'll break your skull into two

682
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:46,871
Chase him away
from that place

683
00:42:51,025 --> 00:42:52,692
Don't stop
Drench him head to toe

684
00:42:59,646 --> 00:43:01,188
What's wrong with him?

685
00:43:01,353 --> 00:43:03,728
Not the least bit scared
he is staring daggers at us

686
00:43:04,607 --> 00:43:07,316
Instead of running for his life
he is staring rooted to the spot

687
00:43:18,824 --> 00:43:20,449
Tank empty, huh?

688
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:22,631
Guna bro

689
00:43:23,372 --> 00:43:25,372
Let me go

690
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,408
Start, go...quick

691
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,749
Drive fast
or we'll be caught @can’t hear

692
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:46,924
I'll close your chapter

693
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,965
Is peeing such a crime?can’t hear

694
00:43:56,837 --> 00:43:59,254
If only I get hold of you-

695
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:10,226
Not bad, this social work
has its enjoyable moments

696
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:11,084
You bet it is! @

697
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:12,453
Call me now and then, I'll come

698
00:44:12,478 --> 00:44:14,061
You are bleeding
What happened?

699
00:44:14,187 --> 00:44:15,687
He threw the knife at me, right?

700
00:44:16,129 --> 00:44:17,712
- It slashed me
- Such a sharp knife

701
00:44:17,737 --> 00:44:19,445
Just missed!
It would have pierced you

702
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,803
Don't give me the jitters

703
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:22,458
Take care, bye

704
00:44:22,499 --> 00:44:24,583
Call me again
for 'taking a shot'

705
00:44:25,387 --> 00:44:26,387
Sanjeevi

706
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:29,446
You got hurt
because of me

707
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:31,974
You are shedding blood and sweat
for the sake of our society

708
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:34,083
Won't I shed 2 drops
of blood for you?

709
00:44:34,108 --> 00:44:35,900
This is cake walk for me

710
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,216
Anything for you

711
00:44:47,926 --> 00:44:49,134
Consult a doctor

712
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,583
Why are you running as if
you're being chased by a dog?

713
00:45:00,608 --> 00:45:02,274
I got some earth shattering news

714
00:45:02,316 --> 00:45:04,309
Your picture has come in
an English magazine, bro

715
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,542
- Jailor gave it
- What?

716
00:45:05,722 --> 00:45:07,180
I killed that jobless jerk?

717
00:45:07,326 --> 00:45:08,826
See how sexy you look

718
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:12,393
Hey! Why have they published a snap
of me in my briefs on the cover page?

719
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,251
Remember the guy who sprayed
water on me from a lorry

720
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:16,964
Find out who he is right away

721
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:19,280
I'll make mincemeat
out of him in such a way...

722
00:45:19,545 --> 00:45:22,253
...he shouldn't even water
the plants in his house!

723
00:45:22,278 --> 00:45:23,778
Can I say something?

724
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:26,274
I didn't piss anyone off
And I landed here

725
00:45:26,347 --> 00:45:27,889
But you pissed and came in

726
00:45:28,093 --> 00:45:29,385
Pound him to a pulp

727
00:45:30,709 --> 00:45:32,709
- First find that fellow
- Certainly, bro

728
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:37,264
"Hey! Absolute freedom-"

729
00:45:37,305 --> 00:45:39,389
Check the 3rd table
if they need more booze

730
00:45:42,014 --> 00:45:44,347
You don't drink or smoke
No bad habits at all

731
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:46,239
Why did you come to
the bachelor's party?

732
00:45:46,264 --> 00:45:47,722
I'm thinking of
joining the gym

733
00:45:47,722 --> 00:45:49,139
Need protein to
beef up my body

734
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:50,247
Where is the chicken?

735
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,639
Came to check out
the chick Sunitha, right?

736
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:55,171
I can read your mind

737
00:45:55,196 --> 00:45:56,405
Let's go

738
00:45:56,823 --> 00:45:58,739
Do you see 'Kurkure'
standing there?

739
00:45:58,857 --> 00:46:00,565
- Kurkure...?
- Don't say it loudly

740
00:46:02,906 --> 00:46:04,989
Sanjeevi, how come you are here?

741
00:46:05,014 --> 00:46:06,347
Just like that, I dropped by-

742
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:08,722
Forget the past

743
00:46:08,847 --> 00:46:11,639
My boss's wife is
suffering from insomnia

744
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,680
She took out the frustration of
sleepless nights on her husband

745
00:46:14,764 --> 00:46:16,222
Boss transferred it onto me

746
00:46:16,438 --> 00:46:17,980
I took it out on you

747
00:46:18,089 --> 00:46:20,005
She can't sleep
That's all, right?

748
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,947
My grandma couldn't sleep
for past 4 years

749
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,280
Did you forget, he made
her yawn and sleep?

750
00:46:24,305 --> 00:46:26,430
Aah! How could I?

751
00:46:26,472 --> 00:46:27,764
Then do me a huge favor

752
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:30,805
Somehow make this lady fall asleep

753
00:46:30,847 --> 00:46:32,764
Then all our problems
will get solved

754
00:46:33,461 --> 00:46:35,002
This is child's play
for my friend

755
00:46:35,135 --> 00:46:35,860
What say, dude?

756
00:46:35,885 --> 00:46:37,343
I can do it in a jiffy

757
00:46:40,902 --> 00:46:44,027
You're the only dad in the world
to host a bachelor party for your son

758
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:46,002
Shoved both his feet in!

759
00:46:47,948 --> 00:46:49,864
I'm the bachelor
hosting this party!

760
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:51,639
Not yet started in life

761
00:46:51,722 --> 00:46:52,764
Waiting for a wife!

762
00:46:53,472 --> 00:46:54,889
What are you looking at?

763
00:46:54,972 --> 00:46:58,680
All girls want only grooms
who've settled down in life

764
00:46:58,764 --> 00:47:00,722
Only now I am well settled

765
00:47:01,722 --> 00:47:03,764
All girls, attention please

766
00:47:04,972 --> 00:47:08,097
If you're looking out only for
grooms who are well settled...

767
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,597
...you'll get a groom like him

768
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,805
Take a good look

769
00:47:13,055 --> 00:47:15,764
- Need to talk
- Coming

770
00:47:17,764 --> 00:47:19,097
He's still desperate

771
00:47:23,889 --> 00:47:25,222
How am I?

772
00:47:28,175 --> 00:47:29,967
Gorgeous glam doll!

773
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:32,201
Not asking about
my appearance

774
00:47:32,555 --> 00:47:34,389
Am I a good girl?

775
00:47:34,514 --> 00:47:37,680
Aiyo! 24 carat gold

776
00:47:38,514 --> 00:47:41,847
If I profess my love to a guy...

777
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:43,514
...will he accept me?

778
00:47:43,555 --> 00:47:44,805
If you just wave your hand...

779
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:48,097
... ...boys will knead their fingers
and toe the line at once

780
00:47:48,362 --> 00:47:49,487
Okay

781
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,097
I want to...

782
00:47:53,064 --> 00:47:54,430
...tell you something

783
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:56,389
But before that I want
to share something

784
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:57,472
What...?

785
00:47:57,555 --> 00:47:58,680
That you don't have a job

786
00:47:58,722 --> 00:48:00,680
And you yawn, right?

787
00:48:02,444 --> 00:48:03,485
Neither

788
00:48:05,225 --> 00:48:06,766
I'm second hand

789
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:09,680
That means?

790
00:48:11,979 --> 00:48:14,739
A girl by name Mandhakini and I...

791
00:48:14,823 --> 00:48:16,614
...for sometime
we have been-

792
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:17,811
That's enough

793
00:48:17,911 --> 00:48:19,119
Let me explain in detail

794
00:48:19,144 --> 00:48:19,811
No need

795
00:48:19,836 --> 00:48:20,753
I got it

796
00:48:20,914 --> 00:48:22,539
God has given me brains

797
00:48:23,937 --> 00:48:25,437
Sunitha, I want-

798
00:48:25,615 --> 00:48:26,823
No, I meant-

799
00:48:28,292 --> 00:48:30,584
"My dear flower blushing red"

800
00:48:30,609 --> 00:48:33,526
"Your fragrance dizzies my head"

801
00:48:33,947 --> 00:48:39,239
"My front porch will be
your park perennially"

802
00:48:39,588 --> 00:48:42,380
"A flute so expressi-"

803
00:48:42,405 --> 00:48:44,572
"...blushing red"

804
00:48:44,597 --> 00:48:45,805
Sit in a corner

805
00:48:45,906 --> 00:48:46,864
'Don't get in my way'

806
00:48:46,951 --> 00:48:48,534
She's tippled thrice over

807
00:48:54,003 --> 00:48:55,545
"My dear flower-"

808
00:48:56,370 --> 00:49:01,703
"Your fragrance...dizzy spell-"

809
00:49:04,584 --> 00:49:06,167
Have you been boozing?

810
00:49:08,802 --> 00:49:09,635
Why...?

811
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,584
How long have you
been into this?

812
00:49:11,805 --> 00:49:13,972
This is my 1st time

813
00:49:14,228 --> 00:49:15,895
You are really tipsy

814
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,920
Please give it to me

815
00:49:16,945 --> 00:49:18,487
No...I won't

816
00:49:21,222 --> 00:49:22,764
If you are steady...

817
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:24,776
...repeat after me

818
00:49:26,031 --> 00:49:28,115
- What?
- Say 66

819
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:33,666
Listen

820
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,430
If you can say 66
without a slur...

821
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:38,014
...you are steady on your feet

822
00:49:43,455 --> 00:49:44,705
Sisty sis

823
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,772
Sisty sis?!

824
00:49:47,264 --> 00:49:48,264
Sixty six

825
00:49:48,305 --> 00:49:49,389
Loud and clear

826
00:49:55,065 --> 00:49:56,982
Sishty-

827
00:49:59,751 --> 00:50:00,793
Dear...?

828
00:50:00,818 --> 00:50:02,401
My God! Sanjeev

829
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,347
Am I really piss drunk?

830
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:07,828
Way beyond piss drunk!

831
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:10,430
Won't I be able to walk?

832
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:11,177
Walk...?

833
00:50:11,222 --> 00:50:12,722
If your mouth slurs on 66...

834
00:50:12,764 --> 00:50:14,472
...your feet will do an X for sure!

835
00:50:14,572 --> 00:50:16,322
If 'pple fine' out I'm 'drun'...

836
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,722
...my dignity will go
for a toss, Sanjeev

837
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:20,572
Please do something

838
00:50:20,597 --> 00:50:21,930
Oh God...!

839
00:50:21,972 --> 00:50:24,972
Kishna, Dama, Dovinda

840
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:26,430
Put your arms on my shoulder

841
00:50:26,472 --> 00:50:28,115
- Shoulder...?
- I'll pretend to be drunk

842
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,723
You hold me as if
you're helping me

843
00:50:29,906 --> 00:50:31,571
Passersby will think
I am the one drunk

844
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:33,471
You can lean on me
walk up to the gate

845
00:50:34,393 --> 00:50:36,101
As if you'll come home

846
00:50:40,823 --> 00:50:42,156
Okay, let's go

847
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,843
Lean on me...walk along with me

848
00:50:47,154 --> 00:50:50,070
Balance properly
Back straight

849
00:50:50,722 --> 00:50:54,055
Social service has got
into Sunitha's bloodstream!

850
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:56,097
He's drunk as a skunk

851
00:50:56,139 --> 00:50:58,597
Look how well she is
handling that drunken slob

852
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:01,408
You're a good fellow

853
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,725
'Why the sudden compliment?'

854
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:06,542
You told me frankly you're a second
hand piece, right?Watch your step

855
00:51:08,722 --> 00:51:09,680
What...?

856
00:51:09,989 --> 00:51:12,572
Why are you holding my hip?

857
00:51:12,597 --> 00:51:13,805
Why...?

858
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:15,621
Fall flat

859
00:51:15,646 --> 00:51:16,729
What...?

860
00:51:17,223 --> 00:51:18,305
If I don't hold you...

861
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:19,805
...you'll fall flat!

862
00:51:19,847 --> 00:51:21,472
Then hold me...tight

863
00:51:21,514 --> 00:51:23,014
You bet I will, alright

864
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,237
Hey, what cheek!

865
00:51:30,038 --> 00:51:31,746
Your cheek is touching mine

866
00:51:31,771 --> 00:51:33,722
If not, your head will drop
without my support

867
00:51:33,722 --> 00:51:36,055
Your image will be spoilt
Is that okay with you?

868
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:37,697
No...no...!

869
00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:39,889
Touch me...as much as you want

870
00:51:40,026 --> 00:51:41,984
I am on cloud 9!

871
00:51:42,901 --> 00:51:44,776
Hold me tight

872
00:51:44,972 --> 00:51:47,722
My precious chubbiness!

873
00:51:47,915 --> 00:51:51,332
Sanjee, am I stinking?

874
00:51:51,357 --> 00:51:53,398
Distilled water won't make you stink!

875
00:51:57,222 --> 00:51:58,930
You found out?

876
00:51:59,128 --> 00:52:00,753
I knew right from the start

877
00:52:03,088 --> 00:52:04,671
Your idea of a twist?

878
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:07,756
101% waste

879
00:52:08,082 --> 00:52:09,332
What do I do with you?

880
00:52:09,357 --> 00:52:10,732
Do whatever you want

881
00:52:33,968 --> 00:52:39,427
"Bubbly, bright and bouncy
You're my bubbly baby"

882
00:52:44,677 --> 00:52:50,177
"Dazed, dipsy, dizzy
I feel giddy, don't tease me"

883
00:52:55,563 --> 00:53:00,980
"Perfect for a selfie
Stands this glam-doll girlie"

884
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:06,089
"God has created a miracle
She's an angel, you dumbbell!"

885
00:53:06,214 --> 00:53:11,297
"Like a star this baby dear
twinkles, sparkles shining clear"

886
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:16,469
"In a drunken stupor, high
looped and loaded am I"

887
00:53:16,672 --> 00:53:22,339
"Bubbly, bright and bouncy
You're my fizzy baby"

888
00:53:27,312 --> 00:53:32,895
"Weak in the knees, wobbly
I feel woozy, don't tease me"

889
00:53:59,547 --> 00:54:04,922
"Step by step you flirted with me
Stuck to me like glue firmly"

890
00:54:04,964 --> 00:54:10,255
"Cartloads of ice flattering me
you pile up on my head steadily"

891
00:54:10,297 --> 00:54:15,172
"I am not joking, it's true
I swear I fell flat for you"

892
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:20,672
"If you don't believe me
I've sliced my heart for you to see"

893
00:54:20,755 --> 00:54:23,297
"Thanks to you, deep inside
I soften, I liquefy"

894
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:25,922
"I am just not me
I melt slowly"

895
00:54:25,964 --> 00:54:29,797
"I freeze, I break freely
I lose myself fully"

896
00:54:31,255 --> 00:54:36,547
"Bubbly, bright and bouncy
You're my cheery baby"

897
00:54:46,922 --> 00:54:49,880
"Hit on me, honey
Inch close to me"

898
00:54:49,922 --> 00:54:52,630
"Flirt with ease
Say 'okay' please"

899
00:54:52,714 --> 00:54:57,547
"What do you have so potent?
It made me flip heels over head"

900
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,630
"You are so cool, baby
I'll catch a cold immediately"

901
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,297
"Your boyfriend let me be
I hold a PhD in love, trust me"

902
00:55:03,339 --> 00:55:06,672
"Don't spear your eyes on me
like a sword from its sheath fiercely"

903
00:55:08,755 --> 00:55:13,172
"You're my bubbly baby"

904
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:25,005
"Come here, dolly"

905
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,297
"Hey! Come here, girlie!"

906
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:36,797
"Sssshhhhh!"

907
00:55:56,964 --> 00:55:58,143
Please come in

908
00:55:58,168 --> 00:56:00,210
- Has Rahul briefed you?
- Yes, sir

909
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:02,318
You make your colleagues
yawn and fall asleep

910
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:03,492
I've seen it in a video

911
00:56:03,589 --> 00:56:05,047
It didn't occur to me then

912
00:56:05,089 --> 00:56:06,130
But good you're here

913
00:56:06,172 --> 00:56:07,714
- Please come
- Where's your wife?

914
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,005
She's upstairs in her room

915
00:56:19,828 --> 00:56:21,411
If you yawn...

916
00:56:21,436 --> 00:56:23,228
...then only you should feel sleepy

917
00:56:23,523 --> 00:56:25,065
How will I fall asleep?

918
00:56:25,099 --> 00:56:26,349
You'll definitely sleep

919
00:56:33,422 --> 00:56:35,005
Crazy people...lunatics!

920
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:45,241
Purushothama...!

921
00:56:45,393 --> 00:56:46,726
Am I not laughing?

922
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:49,159
Laugh along with me

923
00:56:50,393 --> 00:56:51,559
Laugh, man

924
00:57:00,366 --> 00:57:03,430
Sir,Sleeping is not the solution

925
00:57:03,464 --> 00:57:04,922
She needs professional help

926
00:57:04,964 --> 00:57:06,630
I think she is mentally afflicted

927
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,130
She'll be fine if she sleeps

928
00:57:10,155 --> 00:57:11,696
Somehow yawn
and make her sleep

929
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:13,138
I'm unable to yawn

930
00:57:13,765 --> 00:57:15,265
Look at her intently

931
00:57:15,339 --> 00:57:16,922
You'll automatically yawn

932
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:21,851
Sir, if I look at her closely...

933
00:57:22,487 --> 00:57:24,112
...I feel like puking

934
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:26,682
Please yawn
Keep trying

935
00:57:31,182 --> 00:57:33,140
Why are you smiling
in that weird way?

936
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,883
Don't know
I'll keep trying

937
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:39,129
Your mouth is twisting
to one side

938
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:43,903
Yes...it's coming

939
00:57:56,589 --> 00:57:58,464
Her head is missing

940
00:58:01,339 --> 00:58:03,839
Sir, I didn't do anything

941
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:06,672
What did you do to her?

942
00:58:06,714 --> 00:58:09,089
Instead of making her sleep
you threw her in a heap!

943
00:58:10,755 --> 00:58:12,172
Please don't drag me into this

944
00:58:12,214 --> 00:58:14,130
She'll keep cussing me now

945
00:58:14,422 --> 00:58:16,130
Lift me, I say

946
00:58:18,922 --> 00:58:20,505
Come here, you ass

947
00:58:21,047 --> 00:58:22,714
Get hold of him, dumbo

948
00:58:26,047 --> 00:58:27,047
Tell me

949
00:58:27,089 --> 00:58:28,505
My yawn is becoming worse

950
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:29,422
What...?

951
00:58:29,505 --> 00:58:31,214
- Becoming worse?
- Yes, doctor

952
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,439
My yawn flung a fat woman
to one end of the room

953
00:58:34,464 --> 00:58:37,464
Okay, just come to
my office immediately

954
00:58:38,755 --> 00:58:41,422
He has insulted you
showing you half naked

955
00:58:42,992 --> 00:58:46,075
Do you know the man you disrobed
in the middle of the road?

956
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:47,214
Tell me

957
00:58:47,297 --> 00:58:48,464
Cooling glass Guna

958
00:58:48,505 --> 00:58:49,672
So what?

959
00:58:50,189 --> 00:58:52,564
You misunderstood
his nickname

960
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:53,928
He sends people
to the graveyard!

961
00:58:53,953 --> 00:58:55,828
If you get caught,
your chapter is closed

962
00:58:56,034 --> 00:58:57,992
I'm running an important errand

963
00:58:58,089 --> 00:58:59,589
I'll call you later

964
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:00,964
Hang up now

965
00:59:02,807 --> 00:59:05,140
Claiming to make
the city clean...

966
00:59:05,252 --> 00:59:07,043
...you've clean polished his life

967
00:59:07,172 --> 00:59:09,339
Look at your faces
like battered coins@

968
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:16,244
He lives in Saligramam
Opposite the temple

969
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:18,214
We'll reach in 5 minutes

970
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:09,473
Who are you?

971
01:00:09,964 --> 01:00:12,339
Take your hands off

972
01:00:36,422 --> 01:00:39,047
The other day I didn't know
and I sprayed-

973
01:00:48,797 --> 01:00:50,714
You were standing in your briefs
in the middle of the roa-

974
01:00:57,922 --> 01:00:59,047
You know what?

975
01:01:00,776 --> 01:01:01,609
You are better off dead

976
01:02:25,422 --> 01:02:27,589
What happened, bro?

977
01:02:28,172 --> 01:02:30,339
Help

978
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:34,130
Get up, bro

979
01:02:34,255 --> 01:02:36,339
He is escaping

980
01:02:50,126 --> 01:02:52,918
Cooling glass Guna
is blind now, huh?

981
01:02:53,084 --> 01:02:54,376
What do you mean?

982
01:03:01,751 --> 01:03:04,168
Hey! What really happened there?

983
01:03:04,209 --> 01:03:06,168
We were holding him

984
01:03:06,339 --> 01:03:08,839
Bro came running real fast
with the machete in his hand

985
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:10,453
But he danced before that, right?

986
01:03:10,478 --> 01:03:13,351
Acid, he struck out with
the machete before I hit him

987
01:03:13,376 --> 01:03:15,584
The machete is 3 feet long

988
01:03:15,809 --> 01:03:17,976
If you add the length
of bro's arm to the 3'...

989
01:03:18,001 --> 01:03:20,001
...it should've spliced
deep into his neck!

990
01:03:20,084 --> 01:03:21,084
That didn't happen

991
01:03:21,126 --> 01:03:22,376
Only bro's eyes felt the blow

992
01:03:22,376 --> 01:03:23,376
Indeed

993
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,008
Bro, what really happened there?

994
01:03:27,768 --> 01:03:29,684
- I am in the dark
- So is he!

995
01:03:29,709 --> 01:03:31,709
He might be able to see

996
01:03:31,878 --> 01:03:33,425
Or he might just
end up being blind

997
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:35,117
What do you mean, doctor?

998
01:03:35,297 --> 01:03:36,630
Dude, I am at the hospital

999
01:03:36,702 --> 01:03:37,702
I'm coming up

1000
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,893
Give me 2 minutes

1001
01:03:44,376 --> 01:03:46,334
Did Sekar's men do something?

1002
01:03:47,334 --> 01:03:49,501
Why is he creeping in
looking petrified?

1003
01:03:50,501 --> 01:03:52,793
If I say something,
promise you won't beat me

1004
01:03:52,892 --> 01:03:53,684
What...?

1005
01:03:53,709 --> 01:03:55,668
The person who gorged your eyes...

1006
01:03:55,851 --> 01:03:57,101
...wasn't him

1007
01:03:57,126 --> 01:03:58,209
Then who?

1008
01:03:58,767 --> 01:04:00,309
It is 'that thing'

1009
01:04:00,334 --> 01:04:01,876
- What...?
- That, bro

1010
01:04:01,993 --> 01:04:03,201
In that temple...

1011
01:04:03,226 --> 01:04:05,601
...remember the person
who was possessed

1012
01:04:05,743 --> 01:04:07,326
That spirit...

1013
01:04:07,351 --> 01:04:08,684
...invaded his body

1014
01:04:08,739 --> 01:04:11,031
...and flung you

1015
01:04:11,668 --> 01:04:13,459
Come close...closer

1016
01:04:13,709 --> 01:04:15,376
Don't hit me

1017
01:04:15,376 --> 01:04:16,459
Please don't

1018
01:04:17,418 --> 01:04:19,168
This entire town is scared of me

1019
01:04:19,251 --> 01:04:21,334
Rambling about ghosts and spirits

1020
01:04:21,637 --> 01:04:22,720
Bro...!

1021
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:24,626
What did the doctor say?

1022
01:04:24,709 --> 01:04:26,376
I must remove
this bandage soon

1023
01:04:26,459 --> 01:04:27,793
He has to be...

1024
01:04:27,893 --> 01:04:29,101
...pickled to pieces

1025
01:04:29,126 --> 01:04:30,626
I must see him die
in front of me

1026
01:04:30,709 --> 01:04:32,209
That isn't possible, bro

1027
01:04:32,251 --> 01:04:35,584
Doctor said it's doubtful
if you'll be able to see again

1028
01:04:38,543 --> 01:04:39,793
Confirmed, bro

1029
01:04:40,685 --> 01:04:42,143
Didn't he open his mouth?

1030
01:04:42,168 --> 01:04:43,540
He breathed out air

1031
01:04:44,001 --> 01:04:45,501
It's an airy spirit

1032
01:04:45,959 --> 01:04:48,084
You said you will
pluck that spirit's eyes

1033
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:50,256
But the spirit got the better of you

1034
01:05:02,592 --> 01:05:04,126
Guess what?

1035
01:05:04,168 --> 01:05:04,793
What...?

1036
01:05:04,918 --> 01:05:07,043
Cooling glass Guna
 is in the next ward

1037
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:08,652
Don't worry

1038
01:05:09,584 --> 01:05:10,668
No problem at all

1039
01:05:13,251 --> 01:05:14,959
Someone has beaten him up to a pulp

1040
01:05:15,001 --> 01:05:17,334
And gouged his eyes out
He is bedridden now

1041
01:05:18,168 --> 01:05:19,251
'Eyes...?'

1042
01:05:20,855 --> 01:05:23,438
I was the one who made him
lose his vision!

1043
01:05:26,688 --> 01:05:30,188
That means all these years I was
befriending Bruce Lee and Arnold!

1044
01:05:31,709 --> 01:05:33,126
Shut up

1045
01:05:33,168 --> 01:05:35,209
I'm myself peeing in my pants!

1046
01:05:36,001 --> 01:05:38,530
- Did you get the result?
- I've given it to the nurse

1047
01:05:38,644 --> 01:05:40,269
I yawned

1048
01:05:40,615 --> 01:05:42,407
His cooling glass broke

1049
01:05:43,376 --> 01:05:46,168
You are being so silly

1050
01:05:46,293 --> 01:05:48,584
I agree you yawned and
made the whole office sleep

1051
01:05:48,642 --> 01:05:50,275
How does it will happen?

1052
01:05:57,029 --> 01:05:58,113
What now?

1053
01:05:58,501 --> 01:05:59,918
Are you furious?

1054
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:02,039
Has a fly got into your nose?
Your ears are twitching     @TC

1055
01:06:02,301 --> 01:06:03,968
A frog is sitting @TC
in your throat

1056
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,785
Soda bottle is opening
in your stomach!

1057
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:07,435
Do you feel like puking?

1058
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,771
If you want to say
something, say it now

1059
01:06:10,543 --> 01:06:12,501
Why are you slipping
into coma now?

1060
01:06:14,597 --> 01:06:16,555
Why is he singing?

1061
01:06:25,751 --> 01:06:27,001
Aiyaiyo!

1062
01:06:32,418 --> 01:06:34,251
Nice yawn

1063
01:06:40,543 --> 01:06:41,793
Is he your doctor?

1064
01:06:46,543 --> 01:06:48,209
Even in my wildest dreams...

1065
01:06:48,293 --> 01:06:50,084
...I never thought
it would be like this!

1066
01:06:50,168 --> 01:06:51,293
Doctor...? remove

1067
01:06:51,418 --> 01:06:52,626
Meant your yawn!

1068
01:06:52,668 --> 01:06:56,168
Didn't expect it
to have such force!

1069
01:06:56,376 --> 01:06:57,293
True, doctor

1070
01:06:57,376 --> 01:06:59,543
I yawn like this
every half hour

1071
01:06:59,887 --> 01:07:01,553
Other than office hours...

1072
01:07:01,578 --> 01:07:04,161
...I'm with you all the time
in my 'lungi' without my briefs

1073
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,311
Signal before yawning
I can't risk being stripped

1074
01:07:06,418 --> 01:07:07,858
- What...?
- Nothing, doctor

1075
01:07:07,905 --> 01:07:10,084
Our nurse was broadminded

1076
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:12,459
Didn’t mind giving us a free show

1077
01:07:12,543 --> 01:07:13,668
Right, sister?

1078
01:07:14,126 --> 01:07:15,168
Bloody buffalo!

1079
01:07:15,321 --> 01:07:16,363
Look what happened

1080
01:07:16,456 --> 01:07:18,059
Everyone had a good look, doctor!

1081
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:19,209
This is very dangerous

1082
01:07:19,251 --> 01:07:21,584
You say you yawn
once every half an hour

1083
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,584
Take my advice

1084
01:07:22,626 --> 01:07:24,235
Whenever you feel like yawning...

1085
01:07:24,379 --> 01:07:26,254
...go to a secluded spot

1086
01:07:26,395 --> 01:07:27,895
Don't take any risk, okay?

1087
01:07:29,209 --> 01:07:30,459
Is there no other way?

1088
01:07:30,576 --> 01:07:31,451
Option?

1089
01:07:31,476 --> 01:07:33,476
I need to ask Dr Mahendran

1090
01:07:33,501 --> 01:07:35,543
Dude, then who is he?

1091
01:07:38,578 --> 01:07:42,453
Change the uniform of nurses
from pinafore to pants

1092
01:07:47,668 --> 01:07:49,543
Look what you've done to Guna

1093
01:07:50,084 --> 01:07:52,793
You've turned Cooling glass Guna
into a visually impaired goon!

1094
01:07:53,173 --> 01:07:54,673
Let's get away from here

1095
01:07:55,876 --> 01:07:56,959
Who is calling?

1096
01:07:57,126 --> 01:07:58,001
What...?

1097
01:07:59,003 --> 01:08:00,669
She's a royal pain!

1098
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:04,113
Where are you?

1099
01:08:04,518 --> 01:08:05,643
What's up?

1100
01:08:05,668 --> 01:08:07,543
On behalf of 'Clean country'...

1101
01:08:07,759 --> 01:08:09,467
...we are conducting
a fashion show

1102
01:08:09,492 --> 01:08:12,075
Sunitha, I have an urgent
call to attend to

1103
01:08:13,626 --> 01:08:16,626
For people like you who need to
attend to nature's call urgently...

1104
01:08:16,668 --> 01:08:18,168
...and not pee on the roadside

1105
01:08:18,209 --> 01:08:21,584
...we are raising funds
to build public toilets

1106
01:08:21,793 --> 01:08:23,584
I've sent you the address
See you there

1107
01:08:23,626 --> 01:08:25,751
Sunitha, listen to me first

1108
01:08:25,793 --> 01:08:28,376
If you're truly in love
with me, you'll be here

1109
01:08:35,334 --> 01:08:36,793
You and your pearls of wisdom!

1110
01:08:36,876 --> 01:08:38,376
Don't take unnecessary risks

1111
01:08:38,376 --> 01:08:39,709
Poor girl!
Listen to me

1112
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:43,043
'Public toilet for every street'

1113
01:08:57,668 --> 01:08:59,959
- All tickets are sold out
- Really?

1114
01:09:01,816 --> 01:09:04,357
- Where is Sunitha?
- In the make-up room

1115
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:10,359
He seems human to me

1116
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:13,652
But he gorged both eyes
without lifting his little finger!

1117
01:09:13,677 --> 01:09:15,219
That too our boss's eyes!

1118
01:09:15,644 --> 01:09:17,293
Good that I'm shielding my eyes

1119
01:09:17,334 --> 01:09:18,543
You safeguard your eyes

1120
01:09:18,584 --> 01:09:20,168
Let's go

1121
01:09:22,376 --> 01:09:25,501
You have only 10 minutes
before your next yawn

1122
01:09:25,526 --> 01:09:26,985
Listen to me
Let's leave now

1123
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:28,668
Let me just mark
my attendance

1124
01:09:29,209 --> 01:09:32,251
1/2 a minute to go and
1/2 a minute to get back

1125
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,251
Poor thing, I'll spend
90 seconds with her

1126
01:09:34,293 --> 01:09:36,084
We still have 7 and 1/2
minutes to spare

1127
01:09:36,142 --> 01:09:38,084
True, you got the malefic effects
of Saturn in your yawn!

1128
01:09:38,242 --> 01:09:40,201
Why do you think
negative all the time?

1129
01:09:40,459 --> 01:09:41,709
I'll be back soon

1130
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:44,125
He runs like a marathon sprinter!

1131
01:09:44,293 --> 01:09:45,751
Wonder what's in store!

1132
01:09:45,841 --> 01:09:47,424
Sunitha, be ready
I'm leaving

1133
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:48,699
You are next in line

1134
01:09:50,251 --> 01:09:51,376
Come soon

1135
01:09:51,418 --> 01:09:53,168
Sunitha, I'm here
I saw you

1136
01:09:53,209 --> 01:09:55,168
My love is true
I have to leav-

1137
01:09:55,251 --> 01:09:56,334
I've proved it

1138
01:09:59,136 --> 01:10:00,594
Aiyaiyo!

1139
01:10:05,543 --> 01:10:07,959
Will you please tie this for me?

1140
01:10:13,474 --> 01:10:14,308
Quick

1141
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:15,292
It's getting late

1142
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,852
I'll tie it for you

1143
01:10:17,168 --> 01:10:18,668
Getting late for me too

1144
01:10:18,709 --> 01:10:20,501
- I'm unable to tie it
- Quick...quick

1145
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,351
My fingers are not
getting it right

1146
01:10:22,376 --> 01:10:24,251
It's getting knotted alright

1147
01:10:24,392 --> 01:10:26,434
But your mind is in a dilemma

1148
01:10:26,491 --> 01:10:27,950
Found out?

1149
01:10:27,975 --> 01:10:29,059
I have to bite-

1150
01:10:29,084 --> 01:10:30,876
Using your teeth?

1151
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:32,668
How is my hair style?

1152
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:33,851
'Surely' super!

1153
01:10:33,876 --> 01:10:35,293
It is 'curly'

1154
01:10:35,334 --> 01:10:36,626
Don't touch it

1155
01:10:36,876 --> 01:10:39,501
For 4 hours, with great difficulty...

1156
01:10:39,584 --> 01:10:42,668
...I've taken each strand of
hair separately and set it

1157
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:45,126
Only 2 minutes left

1158
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:47,232
4 hours just to
style your hair, huh?

1159
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:49,334
Is this bangle fine
or should I change?

1160
01:10:49,376 --> 01:10:50,709
Not good
Change it

1161
01:10:53,381 --> 01:10:56,090
- Is this 'chutti' ornament okay?
- No, change it

1162
01:10:57,504 --> 01:10:59,293
Does this dress look good?

1163
01:10:59,334 --> 01:11:02,334
No, not looking good at all
Take it off right away

1164
01:11:02,376 --> 01:11:05,418
Hey! I know what
you are angling for

1165
01:11:06,154 --> 01:11:07,418
Sunitha will be nailed shortly!

1166
01:11:07,459 --> 01:11:08,918
Sunitha, you are next

1167
01:11:08,959 --> 01:11:10,126
I think time's up

1168
01:11:10,209 --> 01:11:11,668
Good lord! Time up for me too

1169
01:11:11,709 --> 01:11:13,084
I'm leaving

1170
01:11:13,223 --> 01:11:15,209
I'm tense because
I have to model out there

1171
01:11:15,367 --> 01:11:16,367
Why are you tense?

1172
01:11:16,392 --> 01:11:18,851
You won't understand my tension

1173
01:11:18,876 --> 01:11:22,293
Let me be your stress-buster!

1174
01:11:22,334 --> 01:11:24,168
What...what I got to leave now

1175
01:11:24,251 --> 01:11:26,126
I know what you want

1176
01:11:29,293 --> 01:11:31,584
Why are you twitching
your nose like a goat?

1177
01:11:31,766 --> 01:11:33,668
Your lips are in such a tearing hurry!

1178
01:11:33,725 --> 01:11:35,684
Why are you shaking your ears?

1179
01:11:35,778 --> 01:11:36,653
Countdown 9

1180
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,453
"Coming...it's coming...!"

1181
01:11:42,706 --> 01:11:45,122
"Gone...I'm done for!"

1182
01:11:46,157 --> 01:11:47,532
Is this the time to get romantic?

1183
01:11:47,626 --> 01:11:48,709
Countdown 3

1184
01:11:58,974 --> 01:12:00,391
He has opened the compressor

1185
01:12:04,543 --> 01:12:06,584
Go...move aside
Air force is on the way

1186
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:55,343
We were right
Spirit for sure! @add

1187
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,785
Finito!

1188
01:12:34,336 --> 01:12:36,044
She is stepping out like a bear

1189
01:12:36,084 --> 01:12:37,584
This isn't Sunitha

1190
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:54,643
Ma, what's this hairstyle?

1191
01:12:54,668 --> 01:12:56,626
This is an African hairstyle

1192
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,334
Trash can even be on your head

1193
01:13:09,376 --> 01:13:10,418
But not on the floor

1194
01:13:10,459 --> 01:13:13,043
Sunitha bags the 1st place
for presenting this philosophy!

1195
01:13:28,747 --> 01:13:30,476
If this yawning is
such a huge problem...

1196
01:13:30,501 --> 01:13:32,043
...why didn't you
tell me earlier?

1197
01:13:32,084 --> 01:13:33,751
I'm already a second hand fellow

1198
01:13:34,564 --> 01:13:35,897
If I share this too...

1199
01:13:35,922 --> 01:13:37,755
...I was scared
you'll ditch me

1200
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:41,168
Why do you keep harping
on being 'second hand'?

1201
01:13:41,578 --> 01:13:43,703
You get tense
if I come near you

1202
01:13:43,751 --> 01:13:46,126
How did you please your ex-love?

1203
01:13:47,251 --> 01:13:49,543
We went to the theatre
Watched movies

1204
01:13:49,584 --> 01:13:50,876
We had popcorn

1205
01:13:50,976 --> 01:13:54,351
Right, you would have
just watched only the film

1206
01:13:54,376 --> 01:13:56,376
And he slots himself
as second hand

1207
01:13:56,459 --> 01:13:58,793
When you share popcorn...

1208
01:13:59,376 --> 01:14:01,084
...our hands would've
touched, right?

1209
01:14:01,126 --> 01:14:03,668
If you say 2nd hand
for sharing a popcorn...

1210
01:14:03,709 --> 01:14:05,793
...then I'm 15th hand!

1211
01:14:06,543 --> 01:14:08,668
If I add ice cream
and pizza to this list...

1212
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,351
...I'll score a century!

1213
01:14:10,376 --> 01:14:12,751
By the way, I've even
eaten raw mango

1214
01:14:12,793 --> 01:14:13,959
Raw mango?

1215
01:14:14,302 --> 01:14:15,793
With red chilli powder

1216
01:14:20,876 --> 01:14:22,376
Am I okay then?

1217
01:14:25,168 --> 01:14:26,709
O-kay...!

1218
01:14:28,043 --> 01:14:29,418
Come

1219
01:14:36,793 --> 01:14:39,418
"Rain, rain, rain, rain
Go...go...go...go"

1220
01:14:39,501 --> 01:14:43,001
"Don't prod my pretty flower, ciao"

1221
01:14:45,876 --> 01:14:49,334
"Don't poke my dainty flower, ciao"

1222
01:14:52,418 --> 01:14:55,959
"Don't take a jab at my petite flower, ciao"

1223
01:14:59,001 --> 01:15:02,668
"Don't prick my little flower, ciao"

1224
01:15:02,793 --> 01:15:07,793
"You pitter-patter pour
into my heart an encore"

1225
01:15:09,418 --> 01:15:13,793
"A flash of lightning akin
you enlighten what not within"

1226
01:15:15,459 --> 01:15:22,001
"Waves of desire leap to sizzle
Fine tune as rain to drizzle"

1227
01:15:22,043 --> 01:15:25,209
"Thirst on the brink of lips"

1228
01:15:25,376 --> 01:15:28,251
"Time for love tips"

1229
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:34,751
"Don't hurt my tiny flower, ciao"

1230
01:15:38,251 --> 01:15:41,459
"Don't shove my sweet flower, ciao"

1231
01:15:44,793 --> 01:15:48,251
"Don't prick my little flower, ciao"

1232
01:15:58,584 --> 01:16:01,668
"Eye lashes flutter gladsome
With every touch you blossom"

1233
01:16:01,709 --> 01:16:04,376
"Distance is now unwelcome"

1234
01:16:05,251 --> 01:16:08,251
"Like a tempest you wander
in new zones of pleasure"

1235
01:16:08,376 --> 01:16:10,876
"Paths get trampled with fervor"

1236
01:16:10,918 --> 01:16:17,418
"I thought love would just be
an inflicted wound really"

1237
01:16:17,543 --> 01:16:24,126
"Like a magnetic force it attracted
I joined hands and capitulated"

1238
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:31,251
"No part of me is spared
Your lips drizzled to be shared"

1239
01:16:33,876 --> 01:16:37,209
"Don't prod my pretty flower, ciao"

1240
01:16:40,459 --> 01:16:43,709
"Don't poke my dainty flower, ciao"

1241
01:17:07,418 --> 01:17:10,459
"Will your soul soften?
Merge into me senses heightened?"

1242
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:13,584
"Will our hands in love be woven?"

1243
01:17:13,959 --> 01:17:17,043
"Through the eyes will it seep?
Into the heart's atrium deep?"

1244
01:17:17,084 --> 01:17:19,793
"Will you be my whole world indeed?"

1245
01:17:19,918 --> 01:17:26,251
"I was a wretched soul till now truly
Not feeling your warm breath on me"

1246
01:17:26,418 --> 01:17:32,709
"With your hot breath caressing me
I evaporated into a spirit airy"

1247
01:17:32,793 --> 01:17:36,584
"This love will do for me"

1248
01:17:36,668 --> 01:17:39,793
"I'll walk with you, honey
to the end of the world gladly"

1249
01:17:42,543 --> 01:17:45,876
"Don't prod my pretty flower, ciao"

1250
01:17:49,209 --> 01:17:52,251
"Don't poke my dainty flower, ciao"

1251
01:17:55,626 --> 01:17:59,084
"Don't take a jab at my petite flower, ciao"

1252
01:18:02,334 --> 01:18:05,626
"Don't shove my sweet flower, ciao"

1253
01:18:16,617 --> 01:18:17,617
Bro...?

1254
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:20,626
Here's a pair of
new glasses from France

1255
01:18:23,584 --> 01:18:24,376
Here, bro

1256
01:18:24,418 --> 01:18:25,709
Even if a hurricane hits us...

1257
01:18:25,751 --> 01:18:27,334
...it seems it won't break

1258
01:18:27,376 --> 01:18:28,293
Okay, keep it safe

1259
01:18:28,334 --> 01:18:29,168
Bro...?

1260
01:18:30,543 --> 01:18:32,918
Mottai kannan was 100% right

1261
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:34,751
Not only is he a spirit

1262
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:37,001
But his girlfriend is also a spirit

1263
01:18:37,501 --> 01:18:40,751
Even now if I imagine
that girl's face and hairstyle...

1264
01:18:40,793 --> 01:18:42,001
...I get goose bumps!

1265
01:18:42,059 --> 01:18:43,434
Thinking of your plight-

1266
01:18:43,459 --> 01:18:46,209
"Even if the lion loses its vision..."

1267
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:48,876
"...will its ferocity lessen?"

1268
01:18:48,918 --> 01:18:49,876
Coffee, bro

1269
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:51,209
Give it to me

1270
01:18:51,751 --> 01:18:53,751
It's easier to believe
God does not exist

1271
01:18:53,946 --> 01:18:56,084
But must be careful
about supernatural stuff

1272
01:18:57,537 --> 01:18:58,576
Where is my coffee?

1273
01:18:58,601 --> 01:18:59,601
He wants his coffee

1274
01:18:59,626 --> 01:19:01,418
Here it is, bro

1275
01:19:02,309 --> 01:19:03,601
Here, bro

1276
01:19:03,626 --> 01:19:04,709
This side

1277
01:19:05,738 --> 01:19:07,030
Right here

1278
01:19:07,055 --> 01:19:09,013
Hold it...slowly
Drink it up

1279
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,097
That's right

1280
01:19:10,165 --> 01:19:11,290
Hold it

1281
01:19:13,933 --> 01:19:14,891
Let me take it

1282
01:19:15,965 --> 01:19:18,215
- Give me a cigarette
- Give it to him

1283
01:19:19,376 --> 01:19:20,709
Are you mad or what?

1284
01:19:20,751 --> 01:19:21,793
Why get into trouble?

1285
01:19:23,668 --> 01:19:26,251
You got the wrong end
of the cigarette

1286
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,368
Bro, minister is on the line

1287
01:19:29,584 --> 01:19:31,001
Let me talk

1288
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,618
Sir...please tell me

1289
01:19:34,643 --> 01:19:36,393
Bro's eyes-

1290
01:19:36,418 --> 01:19:38,209
Let me try and
be of some help

1291
01:19:39,168 --> 01:19:40,251
Okay, sure

1292
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,793
I'll inform him now

1293
01:19:44,959 --> 01:19:47,459
Bro, minister wants to meet you

1294
01:19:47,684 --> 01:19:48,768
Bloody scumbag!

1295
01:19:48,872 --> 01:19:51,330
You want me to tell him
I'm no longer 'Cooling glass Guna'

1296
01:19:51,355 --> 01:19:53,063
I am 'Blind Guna'

1297
01:19:53,426 --> 01:19:55,842
But if you don't go,
it may look bad

1298
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:57,876
Only we know
you've lost your vision

1299
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:59,251
But they don't

1300
01:19:59,293 --> 01:20:00,626
So we can manage

1301
01:20:01,493 --> 01:20:02,285
How...?

1302
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:03,519
I have an idea, bro

1303
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:13,402
This is the notorious rowdy
Cooling glass  Guna

1304
01:20:14,194 --> 01:20:15,777
You are going overboard

1305
01:20:16,235 --> 01:20:19,194
What gall to wear coolers
in front of our boss!

1306
01:20:20,042 --> 01:20:23,209
Let me see you take
your right foot forward

1307
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,735
Starting on a wrong foot!

1308
01:20:25,944 --> 01:20:27,235
Come in

1309
01:20:28,544 --> 01:20:30,460
He's wishing you, bro

1310
01:20:30,502 --> 01:20:32,762
Why did you lift your hands
like you are Jesus Christ?

1311
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:34,620
Did you tell me if he was
to my left or right?

1312
01:20:34,803 --> 01:20:35,678
He was behind you

1313
01:20:35,777 --> 01:20:37,098
You showed your hands in front

1314
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:38,998
Looks like you'll crucify yourself!

1315
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,211
Who is calling?

1316
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:43,502
1 minute
I'll be back

1317
01:20:43,527 --> 01:20:46,527
They are distributing freebies
in the Govt grocery store?

1318
01:20:46,585 --> 01:20:49,298
I should stand in the queue
because the men's line is shorter?

1319
01:20:49,323 --> 01:20:51,448
We are concluding
a 50 million deal here

1320
01:20:51,574 --> 01:20:52,991
How can I come there now?

1321
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:55,584
I'm in the midst of
a very important meeting

1322
01:20:56,819 --> 01:20:58,444
Don't bother me

1323
01:21:03,777 --> 01:21:04,610
Guna @remove

1324
01:21:04,652 --> 01:21:06,194
Bro, minister

1325
01:21:07,069 --> 01:21:08,069
Good morning, bro

1326
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:10,235
How are you?

1327
01:21:12,527 --> 01:21:13,527
Manivelan?

1328
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:16,235
You have the gall to make
the minister cool his heels?

1329
01:21:17,735 --> 01:21:18,735
Dhandapani

1330
01:21:18,819 --> 01:21:20,319
Let's sit down and discuss

1331
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,402
Sure, we can

1332
01:21:23,569 --> 01:21:24,694
Oh no!

1333
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:28,777
Why did you sit down on the floor?

1334
01:21:29,277 --> 01:21:31,652
You shouldn't do anything
without asking me

1335
01:21:31,836 --> 01:21:33,502
Go

1336
01:21:33,527 --> 01:21:34,485
Walk straight

1337
01:21:39,444 --> 01:21:41,610
Like holding a rope to guide you

1338
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:44,277
Super

1339
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,777
You're doing good

1340
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:50,152
A little to your right

1341
01:21:52,527 --> 01:21:54,944
He's showing attitude big time
Don't let him off the hook

1342
01:21:58,402 --> 01:22:00,860
Guna, we need to
talk to you alone

1343
01:22:00,944 --> 01:22:02,444
Sure, why not?

1344
01:22:04,194 --> 01:22:07,152
Munusu, wait outside

1345
01:22:07,194 --> 01:22:08,235
I'll look into this

1346
01:22:08,277 --> 01:22:09,735
I know how you can 'look'!

1347
01:22:09,819 --> 01:22:11,277
How will you manage?

1348
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:13,576
I can handle this, da

1349
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:14,694
You just go

1350
01:22:14,735 --> 01:22:16,444
They will be watching you

1351
01:22:16,527 --> 01:22:19,152
This will end up in a royal mess

1352
01:22:19,753 --> 01:22:21,169
Watch out, boss

1353
01:22:21,194 --> 01:22:22,110
Tell him

1354
01:22:22,873 --> 01:22:24,110
Guna, 1 minute

1355
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,610
Excuse me

1356
01:22:29,902 --> 01:22:32,944
We can't tell him
straight to his face

1357
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:34,706
He's a weirdo

1358
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:37,319
What is the point
in keeping quiet?

1359
01:22:37,569 --> 01:22:38,944
Come to the point

1360
01:22:38,969 --> 01:22:40,261
We can discuss face to face

1361
01:22:40,402 --> 01:22:43,777
Manivel, why are you so quiet?

1362
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:48,994
Dhandapani, I've also been
watching you from the start

1363
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:50,967
You seem to be
staring daggers at me

1364
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:53,860
I have a busy schedule

1365
01:22:54,285 --> 01:22:55,176
It's getting late

1366
01:22:55,201 --> 01:22:56,743
I have other appointments to keep

1367
01:22:56,919 --> 01:22:58,669
Whom is he talking to
all by himself?

1368
01:22:58,694 --> 01:23:00,235
Tell me what's in your mind

1369
01:23:00,485 --> 01:23:02,485
Why are you silent?

1370
01:23:02,624 --> 01:23:03,777
Are you unwell?

1371
01:23:03,877 --> 01:23:05,002
He's acting pricey, uncle

1372
01:23:05,027 --> 01:23:06,194
Tell me your problem

1373
01:23:06,235 --> 01:23:07,694
If I can I'll solve it for you

1374
01:23:07,777 --> 01:23:10,235
Otherwise I'll just zip my lips
and be on my way

1375
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:15,990
They must be in
a disturbed mindset

1376
01:23:22,527 --> 01:23:24,652
Guna, why were you
talking to yourself?

1377
01:23:28,376 --> 01:23:30,210
Wretched bloody goons!

1378
01:23:30,235 --> 01:23:32,944
You left me alone to
make an ass of myself

1379
01:23:34,198 --> 01:23:36,127
When you went alone
to collect your thoughts...

1380
01:23:36,152 --> 01:23:37,860
...why shouldn't I do the same?

1381
01:23:39,485 --> 01:23:42,194
I saw you muttering
to each other

1382
01:23:42,777 --> 01:23:45,569
I don't like making small talk

1383
01:23:45,735 --> 01:23:47,194
Be frank and up front

1384
01:23:47,277 --> 01:23:49,194
I'll voice my bit
and make my exit

1385
01:23:49,235 --> 01:23:51,360
I'm not bothered
if you are there or not

1386
01:23:53,277 --> 01:23:55,402
I think I covered up
my faux pas rather well

1387
01:23:57,527 --> 01:24:00,360
You've got the assets of
Kittanna Vasu in your name

1388
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:01,210
I did

1389
01:24:01,235 --> 01:24:02,902
Shouldn't it be
in our minister's name?

1390
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:05,694
You were supposed to
take only a commission

1391
01:24:05,819 --> 01:24:08,569
So shall I also transfer
the murder case in his name?

1392
01:24:08,652 --> 01:24:10,689
But enough palms have
been greased, right?

1393
01:24:10,714 --> 01:24:12,297
Then what is your problem?

1394
01:24:12,444 --> 01:24:13,527
I told you right then

1395
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,435
This is the repercussion
if you deal with rowdies, uncle

1396
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:18,433
Remember who you're talking to

1397
01:24:18,523 --> 01:24:20,732
This whole town
knows you only too well

1398
01:24:20,902 --> 01:24:24,860
Some random fellow chased you
in your briefs all over the place

1399
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:26,694
On top of it your nickname!

1400
01:24:26,777 --> 01:24:28,444
Don't call yourself
a rowdy anymore

1401
01:24:28,485 --> 01:24:30,360
- You'll be the laughing stock
- How dare you!

1402
01:24:30,444 --> 01:24:32,420
Is this how
you respect me?

1403
01:24:32,527 --> 01:24:35,444
Sit...don't lose your cool

1404
01:24:36,732 --> 01:24:37,860
How could you!

1405
01:24:38,391 --> 01:24:40,433
Get me that bloody document

1406
01:24:40,944 --> 01:24:42,444
I'll sign it, damn you

1407
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,735
Here's the document
And a pen right next to it

1408
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:01,819
Done

1409
01:25:01,902 --> 01:25:04,277
You signed on
some female model

1410
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:07,847
I was just...

1411
01:25:08,777 --> 01:25:10,444
I was checking
if this pen writes

1412
01:25:10,469 --> 01:25:11,485
Fine

1413
01:25:12,402 --> 01:25:13,444
Where should I sign?

1414
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:15,194
Dhandapani bro, show him

1415
01:25:15,585 --> 01:25:16,502
Sign here

1416
01:25:16,527 --> 01:25:17,444
Here?

1417
01:25:17,485 --> 01:25:18,944
Right here

1418
01:25:19,402 --> 01:25:20,485
I thought as much

1419
01:25:20,527 --> 01:25:22,860
Why are you pressing
my finger so hard?

1420
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:27,347
I signed without raising
an iota of suspicion

1421
01:25:27,769 --> 01:25:28,602
Soooper, bro

1422
01:25:28,627 --> 01:25:32,502
We should kill that chap who is
possessed by a female spirit

1423
01:25:32,824 --> 01:25:35,241
Don't fool around
with spirits, bro

1424
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:41,194
We've killed
a dime a dozen

1425
01:25:41,277 --> 01:25:43,360
Do they all come back
as ghosts to hound us?

1426
01:25:43,402 --> 01:25:44,860
We've killed
a dime a dozen

1427
01:25:44,944 --> 01:25:47,277
Have we killed any girl
who is possessed?

1428
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,319
It is rather confusing

1429
01:25:51,836 --> 01:25:52,794
What's his name?

1430
01:25:52,819 --> 01:25:53,610
Sanjeevi

1431
01:25:53,652 --> 01:25:54,777
Who is with him?

1432
01:25:54,967 --> 01:25:55,902
Only his mother

1433
01:25:55,944 --> 01:25:56,777
Gosh! Not me

1434
01:25:56,819 --> 01:25:57,735
Which area?

1435
01:25:57,895 --> 01:25:59,353
Close by, bro
Saligramam

1436
01:25:59,378 --> 01:26:00,628
They are zeroing in

1437
01:26:09,972 --> 01:26:11,680
Isn't he that ghost's friend?

1438
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:14,819
Get into the car

1439
01:26:18,511 --> 01:26:19,485
Tell me, Mojo

1440
01:26:19,527 --> 01:26:20,694
Isn't Sanjeevi at home?

1441
01:26:20,735 --> 01:26:22,110
He has gone to bring Sunitha

1442
01:26:22,168 --> 01:26:25,710
Cooling glass Guna is
on his way to kill Sanjeevi

1443
01:26:25,735 --> 01:26:27,027
What do you mean?

1444
01:26:27,069 --> 01:26:28,902
Oh no! You don't know
what happened, huh?

1445
01:26:28,944 --> 01:26:30,777
Cooling glass Guna
is a notorious rowdy

1446
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:31,735
Whaaat?

1447
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:33,527
He and Sanjeevi
got into a big tussle

1448
01:26:33,569 --> 01:26:35,360
That's why Guna wants to kill him

1449
01:26:37,944 --> 01:26:39,860
Ma, you wanted
to meet Sunitha

1450
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:41,819
Get out of my way
Sunitha looks pretty

1451
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:44,485
Thank God Mojo called
and informed me in time

1452
01:26:46,069 --> 01:26:49,610
What's your problem with Guna?
He's on his way here to kill you

1453
01:26:49,694 --> 01:26:53,194
Yes, the whole gang is
coming here to kill you

1454
01:26:53,277 --> 01:26:54,527
Let's go to my brother's house

1455
01:26:54,569 --> 01:26:55,610
Listen to me

1456
01:26:55,652 --> 01:26:56,527
Don't be scared

1457
01:26:56,569 --> 01:26:57,902
We can complain to the polic-

1458
01:26:57,944 --> 01:26:59,235
Gawd! They are here

1459
01:26:59,277 --> 01:27:00,569
Let me show them my power

1460
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:01,277
Maa...?

1461
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:03,419
Don't open the door
add@

1462
01:27:03,235 --> 01:27:05,694
- Wait
- Sanjeevi, don't open

1463
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:07,679
Wait, I'm coming @add

1464
01:27:07,944 --> 01:27:09,735
I'll pierce every pore
in his bloody body

1465
01:27:09,777 --> 02:47:11,047


1466
01:27:10,819 --> 01:27:13,152
- I will splice him
- Don't be hasty, ma

1467
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:15,513
He is the doctor who is
treating my yawning

1468
01:27:15,569 --> 01:27:16,610
Doctor?

1469
01:27:16,902 --> 01:27:17,777
Come in, sir

1470
01:27:17,811 --> 01:27:19,061
So sorry

1471
01:27:21,328 --> 01:27:22,745
- Come in
- Please take a seat

1472
01:27:25,944 --> 01:27:30,194
Doctor, Sanjeevi's problem
is curable, right?

1473
01:27:30,902 --> 01:27:33,777
Because of his ailment
a bunch of rowdies want to kill him

1474
01:27:33,919 --> 01:27:35,294
Ma, keep quiet

1475
01:27:35,319 --> 01:27:36,777
Someone is out to kill you?

1476
01:27:37,527 --> 01:27:38,902
Do you know who you are?

1477
01:27:38,944 --> 01:27:39,902
Who am-

1478
01:27:40,444 --> 01:27:42,069
What is your father's name?

1479
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:42,860
Sivaseelan

1480
01:27:42,902 --> 01:27:44,194
Your grandfather's name?

1481
01:27:44,277 --> 01:27:45,277
Kulasekara Alwar

1482
01:27:45,319 --> 01:27:46,360
His father's name?

1483
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,130
Thirumurthy Nayanar

1484
01:27:48,194 --> 01:27:50,194
What is his father's name?

1485
01:27:51,527 --> 01:27:52,527
I don't know

1486
01:27:52,527 --> 01:27:53,902
How come you don't know, ma?
Why are you looking at me?

1487
01:27:54,045 --> 01:27:55,336
Adhiyan Ori

1488
01:28:01,569 --> 01:28:03,110
'During the British rule...'

1489
01:28:03,152 --> 01:28:05,569
'...India's precious gems and treasures'

1490
01:28:05,803 --> 01:28:08,991
'...were seized and
shipped to England'

1491
01:28:09,027 --> 01:28:10,819
'The next target for
the British fell on...'

1492
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:14,444
'...Prabhagiri fort
in Chennaipattinam'

1493
01:28:14,627 --> 01:28:18,502
'The cavalry dispatched was
double the normal strength' @

1494
01:28:18,527 --> 01:28:24,777
'Because this fort had priceless
medical manuscripts'

1495
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:32,527
'These manuscripts had the reason
and cure for all the diseases in the world'

1496
01:28:33,319 --> 01:28:36,610
'Prabhagiri fort that housed
all these precious records...'

1497
01:28:36,652 --> 01:28:39,652
'...was surrounded by serenity
with no security whatsoever'

1498
01:28:40,277 --> 01:28:44,527
'General Hastings and his troop
hesitated for a minute'

1499
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:47,909
'The British cavalry galloped forward'

1500
01:28:48,006 --> 01:28:51,006
'Most unexpectedly,
from the fort's exterior...

1501
01:28:51,152 --> 01:28:54,152
'...a wild gust of wind
blew like a tornado'

1502
01:29:05,544 --> 01:29:07,544
'The one who created
such a tornado...'

1503
01:29:07,569 --> 01:29:08,652
'...was Adhiyan Ori'

1504
01:29:08,735 --> 01:29:11,277
'The lone guard
of Prabhagiri fort'

1505
01:29:11,377 --> 01:29:13,210
'He turned wind into
a force to reckon with'

1506
01:29:13,235 --> 01:29:15,247
'Created a weapon
out of that force'

1507
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:18,425
'Adhiyan Ori chased
the British away'

1508
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:46,360
'Governor Jude Benedick
refused to believe this'

1509
01:29:46,919 --> 01:29:50,333
Of course we know only few
martial arts like Kung fu, Tai Chi

1510
01:29:50,358 --> 01:29:54,900
But unknown to us, these Indians
are a storehouse of such ancient arts

1511
01:29:54,998 --> 01:29:57,873
Their self protection methods
are countless and effective

1512
01:29:57,979 --> 01:29:59,479
In the Korean war...

1513
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:01,069
...opposing Genghiz Khan

1514
01:30:01,157 --> 01:30:02,491
...like Adhiyan Ori

1515
01:30:02,656 --> 01:30:06,281
...they won with the help of a warrior
well versed in this power

1516
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:08,402
I agree Your Majesty is right

1517
01:30:08,516 --> 01:30:11,266
'If Adhiyan Ori holds
his breath once...'

1518
01:30:11,413 --> 01:30:12,746
'...he'll fly 10' into mid air'

1519
01:30:12,944 --> 01:30:15,819
'If he orders the wind to stop
it will obey his command'

1520
01:30:15,944 --> 01:30:21,444
'He has often said the most powerful
weapon in this world is wind'

1521
01:30:24,527 --> 01:30:28,277
We need only the manuscripts
preserved in that fort

1522
01:30:30,735 --> 01:30:32,527
Not just the notes

1523
01:30:32,627 --> 01:30:34,544
If we can get his skills...

1524
01:30:34,678 --> 01:30:37,303
...we can bring
this world to our heels

1525
01:30:45,485 --> 01:30:50,069
All the Northern kings have
surrendered themselves to our cannons

1526
01:30:50,232 --> 01:30:53,190
But you don't seem to be nervous
standing against our forces

1527
01:30:53,215 --> 01:30:54,298
How come?

1528
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:55,448
Who are you?

1529
01:31:00,524 --> 01:31:01,608
Tamilian

1530
01:31:02,027 --> 01:31:04,444
Warfare is our weapon

1531
01:31:06,374 --> 01:31:10,957
I ask of you with affection
to give us your skills

1532
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:14,902
Only love can enslave a Tamilian

1533
01:31:15,069 --> 01:31:17,277
And you are truly
aware of this fact

1534
01:31:19,993 --> 01:31:22,118
Ask me what you want

1535
01:31:22,254 --> 01:31:24,627
I'll give you whatever you ask for

1536
01:31:24,753 --> 01:31:26,295
Just come with me

1537
01:31:27,069 --> 01:31:30,527
If you fix a price to
our bravery and dignity...

1538
01:31:30,866 --> 01:31:33,527
...whoever it may be
his head will fly into space

1539
01:31:34,069 --> 01:31:36,277
I forgive you,
because you are a woman

1540
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,277
You may leave

1541
01:31:38,527 --> 01:31:39,610
Go

1542
01:32:00,735 --> 01:32:04,069
Knowing you cannot
defeat us face to face...

1543
01:32:05,368 --> 01:32:07,368
...you stabbed me
behind my back?

1544
01:32:08,913 --> 01:32:11,996
This fort's savior is forever gone

1545
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:15,444
Bye bye, Tamilian

1546
01:32:18,819 --> 01:32:21,110
This is the eternal wind

1547
01:32:23,444 --> 01:32:26,735
No one can destroy it

1548
01:33:03,152 --> 01:33:05,152
You and your silly build up!

1549
01:33:06,902 --> 01:33:10,194
Such a great power
that saved a whole country

1550
01:33:10,277 --> 01:33:12,527
You think this is a problem
and you are scared?

1551
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:15,319
Adhiyan Ori's power
has been handed over to you

1552
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:18,539
Unable to come out
it has been struggling within you

1553
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:20,652
It has emerged
in the form of a yawn

1554
01:33:21,152 --> 01:33:23,694
That same power
has brought me here

1555
01:33:23,835 --> 01:33:27,502
Ask that power to put an end
to my yawning habit

1556
01:33:27,527 --> 01:33:30,527
It is in you
for a specific reason

1557
01:33:32,527 --> 01:33:33,652
Reason?

1558
01:33:33,752 --> 01:33:36,502
A man has lost his eye
and is out to kill me

1559
01:33:36,527 --> 01:33:38,777
If I ever set eyes on
my grandpa, I will-

1560
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:43,527
This is a book written by
the disciples of Adhiyan Ori

1561
01:33:43,735 --> 01:33:44,777
Practice this

1562
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:46,819
Your yawning problem
will be solved

1563
01:33:47,444 --> 01:33:50,277
Like your grandfather
Adhiyan Ori excelled...

1564
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:52,735
...you may learn the art
of controlling air too

1565
01:34:01,967 --> 01:34:03,300
Get in there

1566
01:34:03,942 --> 01:34:05,580
Why did you bring me
to this exorcising place?

1567
01:34:05,605 --> 01:34:06,647
I have to go to work

1568
01:34:07,235 --> 01:34:09,902
To show your handsome face
and frighten these spirits

1569
01:34:10,023 --> 01:34:10,902
Move

1570
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:12,704
- Show your face instead
- I'll teach you a lesson

1571
01:34:12,729 --> 01:34:15,085
Bro, this is the ghost's close friend

1572
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:16,423
We'll use him as bait
to get our target

1573
01:34:16,597 --> 01:34:18,514
- Where?
- He is the one

1574
01:34:19,235 --> 01:34:20,485
Pound him to a pulp, bro

1575
01:34:27,527 --> 01:34:29,694
Yuck! He won't fall for this bait

1576
01:34:29,871 --> 01:34:30,913
Mr Cool drinks Guna

1577
01:34:30,938 --> 01:34:31,855
Hit you!

1578
01:34:31,985 --> 01:34:32,943
Cooling glass Guna

1579
01:34:32,968 --> 01:34:34,759
Kill me but don't
kill my friendship

1580
01:34:34,862 --> 01:34:35,945
Let me show you

1581
01:34:36,235 --> 01:34:37,860
He's calling his friend

1582
01:34:41,069 --> 01:34:44,269
Dude, Cooling glass Guna
has kidnapped me

1583
01:34:44,485 --> 01:34:45,902
Somehow come and save me

1584
01:34:45,944 --> 01:34:47,652
Has Guna kidnapped you?

1585
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:53,017
I'm sure you'll make an ass of yourself,
fall at his feet and escape cleverly

1586
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:55,217
If I come there
he will kill me

1587
01:34:55,305 --> 01:34:58,264
Try to escape, bro

1588
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:01,360
You are my sole soul friend!

1589
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:03,402
Okay, okay...bye

1590
01:35:07,917 --> 01:35:09,355
Chop his hand
and send it

1591
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:10,463
He will land up for sure

1592
01:35:10,527 --> 01:35:13,319
It will take 2 days to even
identify it, no need, sir

1593
01:35:13,601 --> 01:35:14,476
1 second, sir

1594
01:35:14,501 --> 01:35:15,835
He's calling someone again

1595
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:17,277
Let him call

1596
01:35:19,527 --> 01:35:20,277
Sunitha?

1597
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:22,123
He's talking to the female spirit

1598
01:35:22,652 --> 01:35:25,619
Your guy Sanjeevi has gone
with his ex-girl friend...

1599
01:35:25,794 --> 01:35:28,794
...to the temple in Mangadu

1600
01:35:28,819 --> 01:35:31,235
If you go immediately
you can catch him red handed

1601
01:35:31,277 --> 01:35:33,194
Is he unable to
forget his first love?

1602
01:35:33,277 --> 01:35:34,444
Let me tell you this too

1603
01:35:34,485 --> 01:35:36,319
He'll tell you a pack of lies

1604
01:35:36,402 --> 01:35:38,303
He'll even try to dissuade you
from going there

1605
01:35:38,356 --> 01:35:40,439
He'll claim Cooling glass Guna
wants to kill you

1606
01:35:40,527 --> 01:35:42,235
Don't buy all that
Come immediately

1607
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:44,902
Is he servicing a vehicle
that is already sold!

1608
01:35:45,110 --> 01:35:46,152
I'll be there

1609
01:35:57,110 --> 01:35:58,944
She won't swallow
any of your stories

1610
01:36:03,402 --> 01:36:04,235
Whaaat?

1611
01:36:10,277 --> 01:36:12,194
Bro, the priest is here

1612
01:36:12,629 --> 01:36:13,944
Okay, hold my hand

1613
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:15,527
Get down, bro

1614
01:36:17,877 --> 01:36:20,585
Priest, is all this true?

1615
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:22,902
If a person possessed by a spirit
steps past this line...

1616
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:24,569
...their dance will expose them

1617
01:36:24,652 --> 01:36:26,902
What if they don't dance?

1618
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:29,886
It means they are not possessed
by any ghost or ghoul

1619
01:36:31,944 --> 01:36:33,902
My hands are itching

1620
01:36:34,221 --> 01:36:35,763
Where is his neck?

1621
01:36:35,788 --> 01:36:37,580
Sir, this is my neck
Let go of me, sir

1622
01:36:37,605 --> 01:36:38,730
You are hurting me

1623
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:42,994
The female spirit has come

1624
01:36:43,019 --> 01:36:44,269
The male spirit is with her

1625
01:36:44,294 --> 01:36:45,794
- What?
- Get out of here

1626
01:36:45,877 --> 01:36:48,277
Have you come just now?
He told me you are already here

1627
01:36:48,385 --> 01:36:50,527
The moment you fall in love
trust a bloody stranger

1628
01:36:50,527 --> 01:36:51,569
Not your lover

1629
01:36:51,656 --> 01:36:52,990
Get out of this place right now

1630
01:36:53,777 --> 01:36:55,444
Get hold of them

1631
01:36:56,252 --> 01:36:57,002
Bro...?

1632
01:36:57,027 --> 01:36:58,194
Come here, quick

1633
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:02,902
A little to the left

1634
01:37:02,944 --> 01:37:03,860
In front

1635
01:37:03,944 --> 01:37:05,485
Here

1636
01:37:06,194 --> 01:37:07,902
Right...bang on

1637
01:37:10,944 --> 01:37:13,444
She is as smooth as
a plastic bucket

1638
01:37:13,605 --> 01:37:14,480
Let me-

1639
01:37:15,593 --> 01:37:17,009
Let me caress you once more

1640
01:37:17,034 --> 01:37:17,909
Let go of me

1641
01:37:17,975 --> 01:37:20,058
I have another
problem to attend to

1642
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,319
Move...move

1643
01:37:24,235 --> 01:37:25,902
Get into the square

1644
01:37:29,038 --> 01:37:32,121
Did they dance
like they're possessed?

1645
01:37:32,152 --> 01:37:34,902
No, bro, they are standing
in that square normally

1646
01:37:35,175 --> 01:37:37,342
Bro, they are
ordinary human beings

1647
01:37:39,002 --> 01:37:40,377
I thought as much

1648
01:37:40,402 --> 01:37:42,194
Bring me the sickle

1649
01:37:42,235 --> 01:37:43,360
I'll slice them into two

1650
01:37:43,402 --> 01:37:44,402
Right away, bro

1651
01:37:50,006 --> 01:37:51,631
- Look inside the temple
- What?

1652
01:37:52,608 --> 01:37:54,608
Looking at each other
like dumb temple cows

1653
01:37:54,633 --> 01:37:55,467
Look at me

1654
01:37:55,694 --> 01:37:57,527
Where is the sickle?

1655
01:37:58,569 --> 01:37:59,735
Look here

1656
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:04,819
Why is he doing
the snake dance now?

1657
01:38:04,944 --> 01:38:06,194
What is he saying?

1658
01:38:07,402 --> 01:38:08,235
Here, bro

1659
01:38:08,319 --> 01:38:09,235
Give it to me

1660
01:38:09,277 --> 01:38:10,360
Look over there

1661
01:38:10,402 --> 01:38:12,360
We can kill them both
in 1 swift blow, eh?

1662
01:38:23,402 --> 01:38:24,402
Who is gargling?

1663
01:38:24,444 --> 01:38:26,527
The ghost is gargling

1664
01:38:33,027 --> 01:38:35,527
The spirit is showing
its true colors

1665
01:38:37,444 --> 01:38:39,110
Only the girl is possessed

1666
01:38:39,194 --> 01:38:40,360
Let me kill him

1667
01:38:50,444 --> 01:38:51,402
Who is this?

1668
01:38:51,444 --> 01:38:52,110
Me, bro

1669
01:38:52,194 --> 01:38:53,346
Why are you
adding to the noise?

1670
01:38:53,454 --> 01:38:54,829
I'm chatting up the ghost, bro

1671
01:38:58,460 --> 01:38:59,335
What do I do?

1672
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,644
You should also talk to them once

1673
01:39:00,669 --> 01:39:02,003
Otherwise they will bite you

1674
01:39:05,069 --> 01:39:06,777
How do I make
this ululating sound?

1675
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:11,819
You got it

1676
01:39:33,027 --> 01:39:34,291
What a crappy livelihood!

1677
01:39:34,316 --> 01:39:35,358
You escaped, right?

1678
01:39:35,428 --> 01:39:36,261
Shut up

1679
01:39:36,444 --> 01:39:37,735
Why are you scared?

1680
01:39:37,819 --> 01:39:38,944
Then what?

1681
01:39:39,027 --> 01:39:42,027
You are Adhiyan Ori's grandson

1682
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:43,235
So what?

1683
01:39:44,259 --> 01:39:46,873
Did you read the book
written about your grandpa?

1684
01:39:46,918 --> 01:39:49,002
Did you practice
all that was recorded in it?

1685
01:39:49,027 --> 01:39:50,027
If I do?

1686
01:39:50,235 --> 01:39:51,444
Do it first

1687
01:39:51,648 --> 01:39:54,398
Only then you will
discover your true self

1688
01:39:59,944 --> 01:40:01,110
I'll do it

1689
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:36,514
My bad luck, I got stuck with him!

1690
01:40:40,217 --> 01:40:42,259
'Like your grandfather
Adhiyan Ori excelled@...'

1691
01:40:42,284 --> 01:40:44,492
'...you may also learn
the art of controlling air'

1692
01:40:50,889 --> 01:40:53,014
'Let me try to stop
the fan from spinning'

1693
01:41:21,008 --> 01:41:22,883
We have power shutdown
at all odd hours

1694
01:41:22,943 --> 01:41:24,860
Routine job for
the electricity board

1695
01:41:24,885 --> 01:41:26,177
'Spiritual practice'

1696
01:41:26,342 --> 01:41:28,926
'I have imbibed your power'

1697
01:41:34,853 --> 01:41:36,436
'My next exercise...'

1698
01:41:36,551 --> 01:41:38,134
'...is flying practice'

1699
01:41:58,264 --> 01:42:00,181
Where...where is it?

1700
01:42:00,431 --> 01:42:01,973
Oh! It's right here

1701
01:42:09,204 --> 01:42:10,621
What are you up to?

1702
01:42:10,787 --> 01:42:12,162
Breathing exercise

1703
01:42:12,681 --> 01:42:13,848
The study of Yoga

1704
01:42:13,889 --> 01:42:15,634
Is it falling in place
like your grandpa?

1705
01:42:15,681 --> 01:42:17,306
Working out as we speak

1706
01:42:18,168 --> 01:42:19,501
Even now I'm trying something

1707
01:42:19,654 --> 01:42:21,988
To raise myself up
5 feet from the floor

1708
01:42:22,438 --> 01:42:23,771
Kundalini yoga

1709
01:42:23,806 --> 01:42:25,431
Oh! Really?

1710
01:42:26,806 --> 01:42:28,473
Can you come home
and try this out?

1711
01:42:28,514 --> 01:42:29,806
I would also like to see it

1712
01:42:30,035 --> 01:42:31,035
I'll come

1713
01:42:32,982 --> 01:42:34,732
Is he a rocket to fly?

1714
01:42:34,775 --> 01:42:36,317
This isn't even do-able!

1715
01:42:36,431 --> 01:42:37,556
Let us wait and watch

1716
01:42:37,871 --> 01:42:39,037
Hey! He's here

1717
01:42:41,548 --> 01:42:43,923
Have you issued tickets for a show?

1718
01:42:44,816 --> 01:42:47,406
Raghav, not gone
for your honeymoon?

1719
01:42:47,431 --> 01:42:48,681
Why won't you ask?

1720
01:42:48,681 --> 01:42:51,056
Instead of making
my boss's wife sleep in peace…

1721
01:42:51,098 --> 01:42:52,639
...you broke her into pieces

1722
01:42:52,681 --> 01:42:54,014
I lost my job

1723
01:42:54,056 --> 01:42:55,514
And my wedding was cancelled

1724
01:42:55,556 --> 01:42:57,931
What I spent for
that bachelor's party...

1725
01:42:58,014 --> 01:42:59,681
...went down the drain

1726
01:43:03,473 --> 01:43:04,248
You invited hi-

1727
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:05,547
What are you doing here?

1728
01:43:05,618 --> 01:43:07,160
Not only me
Surprise!

1729
01:43:09,306 --> 01:43:11,389
- Who is this?
- She's my financier

1730
01:43:11,531 --> 01:43:12,656
Financier...?

1731
01:43:12,681 --> 01:43:14,431
Will she lend money
and charge interest?

1732
01:43:14,598 --> 01:43:19,014
He meant she is his fiancée!

1733
01:43:19,056 --> 01:43:20,014
How is my matching?

1734
01:43:20,056 --> 01:43:21,606
Like mismatched sandals!

1735
01:43:21,631 --> 01:43:23,006
You also look like a shoelace

1736
01:43:23,031 --> 01:43:24,031
Did we make fun of you?

1737
01:43:24,563 --> 01:43:25,563
Can't you keep quiet?

1738
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:29,660
Don't keep yapping
Ask him to go up soon

1739
01:43:29,806 --> 01:43:30,681
'Up...?'

1740
01:43:35,389 --> 01:43:37,056
Should I definitely
try it out here?

1741
01:43:37,764 --> 01:43:40,556
If you don't start now,
our dignity will go for a toss!

1742
01:43:40,598 --> 01:43:41,598
Try your luck

1743
01:43:42,462 --> 01:43:44,504
Who is that man with
the salt and pepper look?

1744
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:46,098
Like a scientist

1745
01:43:46,793 --> 01:43:48,584
Laughs like a nutcase

1746
01:43:48,891 --> 01:43:49,933
My dad!

1747
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:55,285
Dad, didn't I tell you?
He's Sanjeevi

1748
01:43:55,422 --> 01:43:56,505
Hi, son-in-law

1749
01:43:56,865 --> 01:43:59,073
I'll be troubled only if
you are floating in booze 24x7

1750
01:43:59,098 --> 01:44:00,681
You'll only be floating in mid air!

1751
01:44:00,764 --> 01:44:02,473
I'm sure you'll ace it

1752
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:04,514
Which place will be
comfortable for you?

1753
01:44:05,431 --> 01:44:06,889
Which is the 'eesanya moola?

1754
01:44:06,969 --> 01:44:08,177
North eastern corner...?

1755
01:44:08,306 --> 01:44:10,473
Let it be there
I'm fine here

1756
01:44:10,681 --> 01:44:12,723
Okay then
Sit here

1757
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,771
Why are you sitting behind me?

1758
01:44:21,941 --> 01:44:23,232
Come and sit in front

1759
01:44:23,469 --> 01:44:24,514
No need

1760
01:44:24,598 --> 01:44:28,223
I've heard enough tales about
your mouth's power from my boss

1761
01:44:30,389 --> 01:44:31,723
Ma, come

1762
01:44:31,806 --> 01:44:32,848
Hey mini skirt!

1763
01:44:32,889 --> 01:44:35,014
Just a precaution
Hold on to your skirt tight

1764
01:44:35,098 --> 01:44:37,556
Manager, switch off the fan

1765
01:44:37,598 --> 01:44:39,227
Won't he get hurt
when he goes up?

1766
01:44:39,252 --> 01:44:40,168
Turn it off

1767
01:44:40,931 --> 01:44:43,931
Looks like he'll really go up

1768
01:44:43,973 --> 01:44:45,639
'My hair will spike up again?'

1769
01:44:45,666 --> 01:44:48,973
Bro, shall I go
to the restroom?

1770
01:44:49,056 --> 01:44:52,098
Snake anti-venom!
Trying to be extra smart?

1771
01:44:52,223 --> 01:44:53,306
Sit down quiet

1772
01:44:54,431 --> 01:44:56,383
Is this really possible,
my dear son-in-law?

1773
01:44:56,408 --> 01:44:59,116
Dad, you'll anyway see it
for yourself soon enough

1774
01:45:00,788 --> 01:45:02,699
Uncle, listen to me

1775
01:45:05,676 --> 01:45:10,259
If you focus your mind and
channelize it to your 3rd eye

1776
01:45:10,284 --> 01:45:14,409
Shut the nine openings
and control the 5 senses

1777
01:45:14,746 --> 01:45:15,912
Not only this

1778
01:45:16,098 --> 01:45:18,181
It is possible to
 achieve much more

1779
01:45:21,688 --> 01:45:23,438
Move closer

1780
01:45:24,431 --> 01:45:25,681
Little lower

1781
01:45:25,739 --> 01:45:26,864
- Madam

1782
01:45:26,889 --> 01:45:27,931
What are you doing?

1783
01:45:27,973 --> 01:45:31,245
Raghav, she wants to
see him flying from level 1

1784
01:45:31,473 --> 01:45:32,306
Is that right?
That’s all@

1785
01:45:32,389 --> 01:45:33,556
Me too Remove
Is that right?

1786
01:45:33,639 --> 01:45:36,264
You cover from the left
and I'll take the right

1787
01:45:36,306 --> 01:45:37,806
What does he want to cover?

1788
01:45:39,681 --> 01:45:41,264
Count up to 3
I'll go up

1789
01:45:53,056 --> 01:45:55,639
Dude, go up...go up

1790
01:45:55,681 --> 01:45:57,931
Lift it

1791
01:45:58,973 --> 01:46:00,098
'My God!
The magic is on!'
@remove

1792
01:46:00,223 --> 01:46:01,931
Go up
Lift it, dude

1793
01:46:02,556 --> 01:46:03,973
Raise it, dude

1794
01:46:14,098 --> 01:46:16,181
'The potato has shown
its true scent!'

1795
01:46:16,264 --> 01:46:18,098
Who moved the chair?

1796
01:46:20,348 --> 01:46:21,806
I'm asking you, right?

1797
01:46:26,764 --> 01:46:28,348
Not me, he did it

1798
01:46:28,431 --> 01:46:30,598
Yes, he's the one

1799
01:46:34,681 --> 01:46:36,348
You promised to fly in mid-air

1800
01:46:36,389 --> 01:46:38,223
And ended up
downloading all the air

1801
01:46:38,264 --> 01:46:42,681
Out of 9 holes, you forgot
to shut an important hole!

1802
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:45,598
Guys, 1 minute

1803
01:46:45,639 --> 01:46:47,639
Let's continue from
where it was emitted

1804
01:46:47,681 --> 01:46:50,306
Am I hearing you right?

1805
01:46:51,556 --> 01:46:53,098
Please wait

1806
01:46:53,181 --> 01:46:55,973
Even when a rocket is launched...

1807
01:46:56,098 --> 01:46:58,056
...it emits reactive gas

1808
01:46:58,198 --> 01:46:59,198
'Philosophy!'

1809
01:46:59,238 --> 01:47:02,613
Rockets are tested
only in open space

1810
01:47:02,697 --> 01:47:05,156
Not in close confines of a house

1811
01:47:05,181 --> 01:47:07,056
My head is spinning

1812
01:47:07,324 --> 01:47:09,532
And here she is
defending this chap who farted

1813
01:47:10,931 --> 01:47:12,264
'You let me down big time'

1814
01:47:13,014 --> 01:47:14,556
'Picked the wrong time to download'

1815
01:47:32,848 --> 01:47:34,473
I can actually see
my reflection

1816
01:47:37,556 --> 01:47:39,098
But with only 1 eye

1817
01:47:59,056 --> 01:48:01,561
Hey! To close your chapter...

1818
01:48:01,586 --> 01:48:03,169
...one eye will do

1819
01:48:41,806 --> 01:48:42,681
Who is it?

1820
01:48:42,723 --> 01:48:44,764
'Knife' Ramesh

1821
01:48:46,572 --> 01:48:47,739
What are you doing?

1822
01:48:47,845 --> 01:48:50,262
Remember the videos on
the internet of you peeing

1823
01:48:50,389 --> 01:48:52,646
I'm deleting all that
with great difficulty

1824
01:48:52,694 --> 01:48:53,694
Go ahead

1825
01:48:54,931 --> 01:48:56,473
Bro, watch your step

1826
01:48:57,590 --> 01:49:00,923
How much he tortured me
not letting me sleep all night

1827
01:49:03,473 --> 01:49:05,723
My bones are all creaking

1828
01:49:05,806 --> 01:49:06,889
'Mottai' Kanna?

1829
01:49:07,208 --> 01:49:07,958
Bro...?

1830
01:49:08,555 --> 01:49:09,889
Are you here?

1831
01:49:09,973 --> 01:49:11,973
- What are you doing?
- Watering the plants

1832
01:49:12,014 --> 01:49:13,556
Very good
They need nourishment

1833
01:49:17,817 --> 01:49:19,229
Can rough up anyone

1834
01:49:19,254 --> 01:49:20,920
But not 'spirits'!

1835
01:49:21,223 --> 01:49:26,931
"Love, my precious eyes
I haven't seen since yesterday"

1836
01:49:41,297 --> 01:49:42,089
What...?

1837
01:49:42,114 --> 01:49:43,531
Bloody mongrel

1838
01:49:46,806 --> 01:49:48,598
Trying to escape?

1839
01:49:48,697 --> 01:49:51,656
Watching porn stuff?
Go ahead, watch now

1840
01:49:51,681 --> 01:49:53,639
Beep…beep
- Don’t hit me, bro

1841
01:49:56,806 --> 01:49:58,681
I turned it off, bro

1842
01:49:58,681 --> 01:50:01,348
Bro, we didn't know
you can see now

1843
01:50:01,389 --> 01:50:02,306
Forgive us

1844
01:50:02,348 --> 01:50:03,223
Let go, bro

1845
01:50:03,323 --> 01:50:05,448
Getting turned on
with a banana, huh?

1846
01:50:05,473 --> 01:50:08,681
Stuff it into your mouth

1847
01:50:10,264 --> 01:50:12,098
Every pore hurts, bro

1848
01:50:14,764 --> 01:50:17,639
Bro, I won't do this again

1849
01:50:17,806 --> 01:50:20,681
Sir, I am blind
Please show mercy

1850
01:50:20,764 --> 01:50:22,223
Forgive me, bro

1851
01:50:25,556 --> 01:50:27,389
Aw! Hurts real bad

1852
01:50:42,931 --> 01:50:47,348
If I let you sleep next to me,
you will steal my booze

1853
01:50:47,389 --> 01:50:49,973
And dance in front of my eyes?

1854
01:50:50,348 --> 01:50:52,489
Now you're shaking a leg!

1855
01:50:52,598 --> 01:50:58,931
"Charmer of my heart, I feel it's a godsend
to sleep in your lap to my heart's content"

1856
01:50:59,014 --> 01:51:02,348
"In that moment
when my eyes close joyfully"

1857
01:51:02,396 --> 01:51:06,230
"My previous births' yearning
are fulfilled joyously"

1858
01:51:11,181 --> 01:51:12,348
Laughing?

1859
01:51:12,389 --> 01:51:13,598
Come and dance

1860
01:51:35,043 --> 01:51:36,418
Stop it

1861
01:51:37,005 --> 01:51:38,797
Scavenger scum!

1862
01:51:39,056 --> 01:51:42,473
Because I can't see
and Munusu also isn't here

1863
01:51:42,681 --> 01:51:44,056
You'll have a rollicking time, huh?

1864
01:51:44,285 --> 01:51:46,598
Munusu is the reason for all this

1865
01:51:46,697 --> 01:51:48,989
He claims to be
your successor

1866
01:51:49,014 --> 01:51:51,264
He is the one rotten apple, bro

1867
01:52:06,931 --> 01:52:08,764
Time for a murder

1868
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:11,603
Look here

1869
01:52:11,848 --> 01:52:14,014
I danced so much
I'm sweating all over

1870
01:52:14,098 --> 01:52:15,931
Go get me a soooper shirt

1871
01:52:16,014 --> 01:52:18,056
He's asking him to
bring your shirt, bro

1872
01:52:18,098 --> 01:52:19,098
Ask him to give

1873
01:52:19,223 --> 01:52:20,556
Get up, I say

1874
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:21,598
Go

1875
01:52:21,639 --> 01:52:22,723
Go

1876
01:52:24,556 --> 01:52:26,848
Do you know
what respect is?

1877
01:52:27,764 --> 01:52:29,098
Watch me now

1878
01:52:29,509 --> 01:52:30,384
Look

1879
01:52:35,598 --> 01:52:36,264
Bro...?

1880
01:52:36,306 --> 01:52:38,848
Munusu, when did you come?

1881
01:52:40,141 --> 01:52:41,183
Munusu...?

1882
01:52:41,931 --> 01:52:43,681
Bro, I'm here

1883
01:52:43,879 --> 01:52:46,879
10 grounds like 24 carat gold

1884
01:52:47,181 --> 01:52:48,764
With encumbrance

1885
01:52:48,863 --> 01:52:51,113
They asked me to clinch
the deal on your behalf

1886
01:52:51,189 --> 01:52:53,522
If you bless me,
I'll finish it

1887
01:52:53,556 --> 01:52:55,264
Please bless me, bro

1888
01:52:55,306 --> 01:52:58,556
Bro, bless me
whole heartedly

1889
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:00,264
Bless me, bro

1890
01:53:00,389 --> 01:53:02,806
- Where is his head?
- Here

1891
01:53:04,965 --> 01:53:06,215
Here

1892
01:53:06,764 --> 01:53:07,556
Bless you

1893
01:53:07,598 --> 01:53:09,181
Don't touch my feet with your head

1894
01:53:09,223 --> 01:53:10,098
Get up

1895
01:53:11,738 --> 01:53:15,196
Who stopped watering
the plants half way through?

1896
01:53:15,727 --> 01:53:17,019
Irresponsible!

1897
01:53:17,079 --> 01:53:18,704
Let go of me

1898
01:53:23,208 --> 01:53:25,958
This is nothing
Wait for more

1899
01:53:29,223 --> 01:53:30,639
Come here

1900
01:53:43,764 --> 01:53:45,876
Bro, I forgot to
tell you something

1901
01:53:45,901 --> 01:53:46,901
What?

1902
01:53:47,090 --> 01:53:49,715
Got myself a new dress

1903
01:53:49,764 --> 01:53:51,926
Wanted to show it to you

1904
01:53:51,951 --> 01:53:55,035
But you can't see

1905
01:53:58,848 --> 01:54:00,098
Be patient

1906
01:54:00,293 --> 01:54:04,709
If only you can see
what I'm wearing...

1907
01:54:05,684 --> 01:54:08,556
...tears of joy will stream
down your cheeks

1908
01:54:08,973 --> 01:54:10,264
It's a fact

1909
01:54:14,606 --> 01:54:15,856
Not only that

1910
01:54:16,056 --> 01:54:18,931
I bought a new knife
for the Panchayat

1911
01:54:35,503 --> 01:54:36,544
You'll get it now

1912
01:54:36,717 --> 01:54:38,592
- Munusu
- Bro?

1913
01:54:38,642 --> 01:54:42,059
I've also bought a new gun

1914
01:54:42,223 --> 01:54:43,098
Bought-

1915
01:54:52,723 --> 01:54:55,889
Fine, he got a gun

1916
01:54:55,973 --> 01:54:58,848
Will a gunman from Ghana
help him to aim?

1917
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:01,681
Give it

1918
01:55:08,098 --> 01:55:09,889
Why is the gun
targeting me?

1919
01:55:31,681 --> 01:55:35,806
Bro, when did you
get your vision back?

1920
01:55:37,681 --> 01:55:38,973
Get up, I say

1921
01:55:41,087 --> 01:55:41,929
When you came in...

1922
01:55:41,954 --> 01:55:43,412
...you were dancing away to glory

1923
01:55:43,437 --> 01:55:44,479
What was that song?

1924
01:55:44,764 --> 01:55:45,681
That was-

1925
01:55:45,706 --> 01:55:47,623
Sing and dance for me

1926
01:55:47,723 --> 01:55:49,014
He got nailed royally @

1927
01:55:58,806 --> 01:56:00,514
Okay, that's enough

1928
01:56:00,556 --> 01:56:03,806
You jigged a few steps
wriggling your butt to me

1929
01:56:03,889 --> 01:56:05,098
Show that step

1930
01:56:05,610 --> 01:56:06,943
Replay

1931
01:56:09,056 --> 01:56:10,306
Did you dance like this?

1932
01:56:10,389 --> 01:56:11,889
You shoved your butt
into my face

1933
01:56:13,848 --> 01:56:15,056
You lifted and rejoiced

1934
01:56:15,098 --> 01:56:16,223
Lift more

1935
01:56:16,264 --> 01:56:18,889
- Did you dance like this?
- Yes, bro

1936
01:56:18,931 --> 01:56:21,598
First I went to the right

1937
01:56:21,639 --> 01:56:22,848
Then to left

1938
01:56:22,889 --> 01:56:24,056
Then I shook my bum

1939
01:56:24,215 --> 01:56:26,381
Didn't you stick your
yucky bum on my face?

1940
01:56:26,406 --> 01:56:27,656
Once more

1941
01:56:27,681 --> 01:56:29,556
Turn

1942
01:56:36,348 --> 01:56:38,723
I'll never raid
your wardrobe again

1943
01:56:40,056 --> 01:56:42,723
Missed by an inch or else...

1944
01:56:42,806 --> 01:56:44,973
...my machismo
would be zero!

1945
01:56:48,056 --> 01:56:49,431
Not me

1946
01:56:55,186 --> 01:56:58,436
He made me look like a joker
in front of my own boys

1947
01:56:58,473 --> 01:57:00,848
Whether he's a spirit
or any damn man...

1948
01:57:01,473 --> 01:57:03,389
...he will die today!

1949
01:57:29,117 --> 01:57:30,700
What is that noise?

1950
01:57:32,242 --> 01:57:32,939
Meow!

1951
01:57:32,964 --> 01:57:34,005
Who are you?

1952
01:57:34,887 --> 01:57:37,804
How dare you walk in
without telling me who you are?

1953
01:57:38,034 --> 01:57:39,034
Where is he?

1954
01:57:39,117 --> 01:57:39,992
Who?

1955
01:57:40,034 --> 01:57:41,117
Your son

1956
01:57:41,159 --> 01:57:42,284
He isn't here

1957
01:57:42,367 --> 01:57:44,034
But why are you
looking for him?

1958
01:57:50,259 --> 01:57:51,125
This is the reason

1959
01:57:51,150 --> 01:57:52,483
I don't know you

1960
01:57:53,325 --> 01:57:54,992
And who are they?

1961
01:57:59,995 --> 01:58:02,411
So you are that
Cooling glass Guna?

1962
01:58:02,604 --> 01:58:04,034
Tell me now
where your son is

1963
01:58:04,075 --> 01:58:05,284
I don't know

1964
01:58:05,325 --> 01:58:06,200
He isn't here

1965
01:58:06,284 --> 01:58:07,075
First step out

1966
01:58:07,117 --> 01:58:09,307
All of you leave right now
without causing any trouble

1967
01:58:09,332 --> 01:58:12,082
I'm telling you to leave
And you're smoking in my house

1968
01:58:12,107 --> 01:58:14,065
If my son gets to know this-

1969
01:58:15,534 --> 01:58:17,133
What audacity!

1970
01:58:17,158 --> 01:58:18,408
You're turning a deaf ear

1971
01:58:18,507 --> 01:58:19,507
Listen to me

1972
01:58:19,590 --> 01:58:20,507
Clear out

1973
01:58:20,667 --> 01:58:23,000
When my son comes
you'll face the consequences

1974
01:58:23,075 --> 01:58:25,367
You have the gall to
make yourself comfortable

1975
01:58:25,510 --> 01:58:26,551
Here, bro

1976
01:58:29,992 --> 01:58:31,367
Sickle

1977
01:58:34,575 --> 01:58:36,261
I'll tell you where he is

1978
01:58:36,296 --> 01:58:38,713
You can't go
anywhere near him

1979
01:58:38,909 --> 01:58:40,742
Do you know his lineage?

1980
01:58:40,964 --> 01:58:43,284
Adhiyan Ori's grandson

1981
01:58:53,950 --> 01:58:57,992
He's in Gopi's mechanic shop
near the factory in Ambattur

1982
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:08,575
No one can destroy this wind

1983
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:10,909
I'll look into it

1984
01:59:26,492 --> 01:59:27,617
What the hel-

1985
01:59:30,075 --> 01:59:33,409
"Don’t die because of me
Save your breath please"

1986
01:59:33,448 --> 01:59:36,367
"Whacked hackled
Hacked mangled"

1987
01:59:36,367 --> 01:59:39,659
"If he stands before you
pulverize him, dude"

1988
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:42,700
"Pelt, pummel, pound
Injure, impair, knock around"

1989
01:59:42,784 --> 01:59:45,992
"Into every pore of his
stuff tongues of flame that hiss"

1990
01:59:46,075 --> 01:59:49,200
"Dissect him to bits
till he no longer exists"

1991
01:59:55,325 --> 01:59:56,367
Go, get him

1992
02:00:13,450 --> 02:00:14,409
Did he hit you?

1993
02:00:14,617 --> 02:00:15,867
No, boss

1994
02:00:15,892 --> 02:00:17,517
He blew me off my feet

1995
02:00:20,617 --> 02:00:21,659
Blew you?

1996
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:29,492
Go, get him

1997
02:00:40,034 --> 02:00:44,534
Don't let go of my hand

1998
02:01:00,463 --> 02:01:02,879
Is he scaring us
or is he scared?

1999
02:01:02,904 --> 02:01:03,987
Really baffling

2000
02:01:04,117 --> 02:01:05,367
He is back again

2001
02:01:06,742 --> 02:01:08,659
He's counting heads now

2002
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:11,784
It is really confusing

2003
02:01:13,950 --> 02:01:19,742
He is either blowing
or he is sucking

2004
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:21,534
What do we do now?

2005
02:01:22,325 --> 02:01:23,450
I'm scared

2006
02:01:30,659 --> 02:01:31,575
Come

2007
02:01:50,861 --> 02:01:52,527
Trying to blow us off our feet?

2008
02:02:53,492 --> 02:02:55,700
My ‘dhoti’ has
gone with the wind!

2009
02:02:57,450 --> 02:02:59,867
Attend to more important work on hand

2010
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:10,784
Somehow run and
stifle his breath@

2011
02:03:23,909 --> 02:03:25,742
Trying to escape?

2012
02:03:55,075 --> 02:03:57,992
You multi task with your mouth!

2013
02:04:39,659 --> 02:04:42,575
Try your blowing act now

2014
02:05:03,367 --> 02:05:05,159
Take it from me

2015
02:05:05,733 --> 02:05:08,025
This is for you to keep

2016
02:05:34,842 --> 02:05:36,217
Where is-

2017
02:05:36,242 --> 02:05:37,659
Hey! Munusu

2018
02:05:41,409 --> 02:05:42,784
Hey! Mottai Kanna

2019
02:05:44,950 --> 02:05:46,534
Where have you disappeared?

2020
02:05:49,284 --> 02:05:50,992
Don't know what he's up to

2021
02:05:53,992 --> 02:05:56,117
Slightest chance
he keeps blowing

2022
02:05:57,030 --> 02:05:59,280
He has a vacuum cleaner
in his mouth or what?

2023
02:06:01,137 --> 02:06:02,512
Where are you?

2024
02:06:02,698 --> 02:06:03,656
Why?

2025
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:06,050
You consider yourself
a hot blooded male, step out

2026
02:06:06,163 --> 02:06:07,967
If you consider yourself
a hot blooded male...

2027
02:06:07,992 --> 02:06:09,950
...fight me with your fist
Not your mouth

2028
02:06:12,367 --> 02:06:13,909
Fine, come out

2029
02:06:14,159 --> 02:06:17,117
Promise me
you won't blow

2030
02:06:18,034 --> 02:06:19,909
Okay, I swear

2031
02:06:20,018 --> 02:06:21,309
First come out

2032
02:06:22,898 --> 02:06:23,773
Come out, I say

2033
02:06:23,909 --> 02:06:25,034
I'm coming

2034
02:06:52,909 --> 02:06:54,284
Wait and watc-

2035
02:06:55,242 --> 02:06:57,617
Let go of my foot

2036
02:08:53,034 --> 02:08:54,659
Hey! Guna

2037
02:09:20,242 --> 02:09:21,617
Cooling glass Guna

2038
02:09:30,409 --> 02:09:33,284
Mojo, my yawning has
stopped completely now

2039
02:09:33,461 --> 02:09:34,169
I swear!

2040
02:09:34,421 --> 02:09:35,588
Don't believe me?

2041
02:09:39,272 --> 02:09:40,438
I'll call you later

2042
02:09:40,463 --> 02:09:41,838
Did you laugh?

2043
02:09:42,159 --> 02:09:44,659
Your problem is
taking a detour now

2044
02:09:44,927 --> 02:09:48,117
Don't laugh even if
you're amused

2045
02:09:48,142 --> 02:09:50,108
Not even if someone
tries to make you laugh

2046
02:09:50,145 --> 02:09:52,062
Be serious all the time

2047
02:09:52,241 --> 02:09:53,241
How weird!

2048
02:09:53,266 --> 02:09:55,349
His problem is taking
a different turn now

2049
02:09:55,492 --> 02:09:58,700
Like the fable where the monkey's tail
was lost but the knife was found!

2050

2051
02:10:18,233 --> 02:10:20,030
Why is Mr Yawn's girl coming here?

2052
02:10:20,089 --> 02:10:21,381
You are doing
great service

2053
02:10:22,050 --> 02:10:22,925
Try this sweet

2054
02:10:22,983 --> 02:10:24,108
How do you like this job?

2055
02:10:24,191 --> 02:10:25,316
Giving salt to the sea?

2056
02:10:27,524 --> 02:10:28,441
Loads of fun

2057
02:10:28,483 --> 02:10:30,024
Spending time with youngsters

2058
02:10:30,066 --> 02:10:31,024
Cleaning the city

2059
02:10:31,066 --> 02:10:32,899
Like being a college student

2060
02:10:33,608 --> 02:10:34,608
I heard about it

2061
02:10:34,707 --> 02:10:36,951
Even if he laughs
he emits a gust of wind

2062
02:10:36,976 --> 02:10:38,435
Do pass on
this message to him

2063
02:10:38,566 --> 02:10:40,274
I am extremely short tempered

2064
02:10:40,316 --> 02:10:42,816
Incase he goes on a laughing spree
in front of me

2065
02:10:45,964 --> 02:10:48,589
You are serving the public

2066
02:10:49,108 --> 02:10:51,316
Why don't you remove
your cooling glass?

2067
02:10:51,399 --> 02:10:53,108
Spare me that request alone

2068
02:10:53,233 --> 02:10:54,733
I'm already like
Long John Silver

2069
02:10:54,816 --> 02:10:56,524
Then not a single goon
will respect me

2070
02:10:56,566 --> 02:10:58,722
If you had given me 'halwa'
instead of this milk sweet

2071
02:10:58,747 --> 02:11:00,206
...it would have been apt

2072
02:11:02,792 --> 02:11:04,167
Ditto!

2073
02:11:12,691 --> 02:11:13,941
Some chap is peeing there

2074
02:11:13,983 --> 02:11:15,316
Go and get him

2075
02:11:18,274 --> 02:11:19,732
Simply!
I was bored

2076
02:11:19,757 --> 02:11:20,757
So I came here

2077
02:11:20,983 --> 02:11:22,941
You'll naturally be bored
if you are jobless

2078
02:11:43,031 --> 02:11:44,823
The old lady has
kicked the bucket

2079
02:12:06,858 --> 02:12:10,274
What else have you hidden from me?

2080
02:12:11,191 --> 02:12:13,316
Open your mouth and answer

2081
02:12:32,858 --> 02:12:34,358
Our boss is fighting
staking his life

2082
02:12:34,441 --> 02:12:36,024
And you're laughing like idiots

2083
02:12:36,066 --> 02:12:37,316
Don't laugh

2084
02:12:37,316 --> 02:12:38,428
Stop laughing

2085
02:12:39,316 --> 02:12:43,066
Bro, laughing gas

2086
02:12:43,149 --> 02:12:44,608
If you inhale it-

2087
02:12:45,149 --> 02:12:47,024
Why are you on
this laughing spree?

2088
02:12:53,983 --> 02:12:55,483
I am hell bent
on killing him

2089
02:12:55,566 --> 02:12:56,983
And you're laughing here .Why
are they cackling like this?

2090
02:13:21,608 --> 02:13:22,983
If he hugs me like this...

2091
02:13:23,024 --> 02:13:24,899
...imagine how tight
he will hug Hansika!

2092
02:13:24,963 --> 02:13:25,880
What to do?

2093
02:13:25,955 --> 02:13:27,239
He keeps hogging
the duets with Hansika!
