1
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,480
Twenty five years back...

2
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,480
...sister of Gangi Reddy was given to
Peddi Reddy and sister of Peddi Reddy...

3
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,400
...was given to Gangi Reddy in marriage.

4
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,000
These two families have been separated
due to clashes amongst them.

5
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,600
And now daughter of Peddi Reddy is
being given to Son of Gangi Reddy...

6
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,400
...and daughter of Gangi Reddy is
being given to son of Peddi Reddy...

7
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,200
...again in marriage...

8
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
...which is happy for us all.
Happy, happy.

9
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,600
Happiness for whom...

10
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,560
...with the fear of losing
the thousand acres snatched...

11
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,360
...from the villagers these two rivals...

12
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,920
...are becoming relatives again.

13
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,480
Bro, will such marriages run long?
Will this marriage take place bro?

14
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,800
- I doubt it bro.
- I have no doubt bro.

15
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,680
Hey, shut up man,
sons of Peddi Reddy are coming.

16
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,720
- Bro, bride groom is shining.
- Come come.

17
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,360
What uncles, have you had food?

18
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,320
Yes, we had.
But, where is your dad?

19
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,080
Dad and uncle as per our tradition are
performing ritual in the temple.

20
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,160
Bro, ritual it seems.

21
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,600
Bride groom to send the saree for her.

22
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,160
So, you are all please get out--

23
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,520
I feel so tense.

24
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,480
Don't worry, Kiran is waiting for you,
near the petrol bunk.

25
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,840
So, we escape here...

26
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,840
...and will go to Vijayawada airport
to catch the Mumbai flight at 7 A.M.

27
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,800
After go to Canada from Mumbai airport
to catch the flight at 11 A.M.

28
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,120
Then don't know any body,
where you can leave the place?

29
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,440
These all happening right?

30
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,960
I strongly believe your love get success.

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,360
Trust on God.

32
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,280
Let's go.

33
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,680
Call the bride.

34
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,840
Call the second bride.

35
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,120
Bride is not to be seen.

36
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,720
I can't pawn my life for the sake of
the wealth of both families...

37
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,560
...and because I want to live with
my love, I am going away from you all.

38
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,400
That Gangi Reddy cheated us again.
Kill him.

39
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,120
These two families
will always keep fighting.

40
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,520
For this marriage of
the girl stopped to happen again...

41
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,760
...some God needs to come down.

42
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,560
The center of attraction
in this city is...

43
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,320
...D Brothers chairman Dhanunjay.

44
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,880
His life ambition is
to become Mayor to this city.

45
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,360
For the same his eye is fallen on
land grabbing, liquor mafia...

46
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,520
...real estate dealing,
wherever there is scope to earn.

47
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,000
His brothers Damodar and Divakar...

48
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,960
...have not just shared blood
but also his nature.

49
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,280
Now corporation elections are completed.

50
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Has purchased the required corporators.

51
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,720
Only one opposition corporator
has not bent...

52
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,640
...and now it is in the hands of that
one whether Dhanunjay is...

53
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,400
...to become Mayor or not.

54
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,800
Brother! Corporator Mahendra, his wife
and children are safe in our hands.

55
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,520
This guy will come to GHMC
and surely vote for you.

56
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,320
If he does not,
single stab to his entire family.

57
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,280
I will vote, I will, I will.

58
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,480
Brother, he says will vote.

59
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,320
Careful man,
he should in no way be missed out.

60
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,680
You do not be tensed brother,
it is like you became the Mayor.

61
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,920
Purchase Pondur khaddar swearing
ceremony and be ready...

62
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,800
...with this there will not be anyone
to beat you in Hyderabad brother!

63
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,400
Hey man, who sent you to come here?

64
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,000
I am not a pet dog like you
to come on somebody ordering me.

65
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,120
Tiger.

66
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,960
Young tiger!

67
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,880
If you hand over me the corporator
and his family you have kidnapped...

68
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,360
...I will go.

69
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,320
I see!

70
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,320
Are so many rowdies and such a big setup
to just hand over so easily to you?

71
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,640
Beat him man!

72
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
Stop!

73
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,960
I feel thrilled to see your anxiety to
hit me even after watching my entry.

74
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,120
That is why I am giving you an offer.
Let us all together sip a tea...

75
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,880
...talk a few words in fun make friendship
and give them to me...

76
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,040
...so that we all can leave happily
to our respective houses.

77
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,480
Saying no, never
and get into ring with me...

78
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,120
...and then later catching my hands,
feet or anything else.

79
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
What else shall we catch?

80
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,000
I will not make friendship with you.

81
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
What friendship with you man.
Hit him.

82
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,560
You are really stubborn.

83
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,080
Okay like you said
we will have those teas...

84
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,240
...talk, make friendship
and leave to our respective homes.

85
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,240
It is shelter
if you take the offer when I give...

86
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,560
...else it is a rupture.

87
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,400
Hey!

88
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,240
He is not the one listening to words.
I will tell.

89
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,880
I am safe...

90
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,720
...now beat him up.

91
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,320
Shut up and sit there.

92
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,400
Son!

93
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,160
Boy, a small compliment from my side.

94
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,960
Not just the vehicle you came on,
but even you are a bullet.

95
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,960
Will look a bullet for watching...

96
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,840
...but you will come to know that
I am a bull dozer once you crash with me.

97
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,320
- Brother, brother!
- Stop brother.

98
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,520
Brother, what is this like have gone mad?

99
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,040
When I do not get the mayor post
what if I die mad?

100
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,280
My aim is spoilt.

101
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,680
Not happened...

102
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,680
...but someone has done willingly.

103
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Who is that?

104
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,960
Brother!

105
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,200
Who was that hit on my ambition?

106
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,360
Do not know who he is,
have not even seen him before bro.

107
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,240
How would he look?

108
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,200
How would he look?

109
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,360
How means--

110
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,560
Yes.. like a hunting tiger brother!

111
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,160
I want that guy, I want that guy.

112
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,400
It seems this guy knows him.

113
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,600
Tell, will give you whatever you want.

114
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,720
I will write half of my property
on your name. Tell, who is that guy?

115
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,800
I am not your informer to tell
if it was other, you idiot!

116
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,640
I am the transformed
who blasted your political career.

117
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,720
Who are you man?

118
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,280
If you need to know who I am,
you should lose three things in your life.

119
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,000
Number one...

120
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,720
...I will hit on the Mayor position
you are getting fascinated day by day.

121
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,520
I have already hit on that.

122
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,880
Number two, will hit on the pride perfumed
and made as status.

123
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,240
I will hit on the status.

124
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,840
Come if you have guts. Come.

125
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,000
You will definitely see me
either when I break in anger...

126
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,320
...or when your fate gone bad.

127
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,440
Who is he man? Who is he?

128
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,640
That is--

129
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,080
My mother.

130
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,280
Hello mom!

131
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,360
How are you son,
are you eating in time?

132
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,080
Sleeping in time too,
I am in sleep mom.

133
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,960
What is that man.

134
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,240
Now if it is morning 12 in India,
then it is night 12 in America, right mom!

135
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,160
That's true.

136
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,120
What is he man, made morning 12 of
India as midnight 12 of America?

137
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,800
You shut up man!

138
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,160
It's okay, Son! You sleep.

139
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,000
- Good night mom.
- Good night.

140
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,120
Saying to have come to enjoy with us
for four days...

141
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,560
...and why are these fights with
the mayor man?

142
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
What are these lies with mom
to be in US, man?

143
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,400
If all have relatives in village,
for us entire village are relatives.

144
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,040
When I was coming back from US
completing my studies...

145
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,800
...it was a festival for my village.

146
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,440
"Good omen four sides
with the sound of Dhamaruk."

147
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,840
"Sweet air in all hearts as
the wealth of good smell."

148
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,280
"This is the revolution rose
in tides in all bodies as fire."

149
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,440
"Stepped in is our young ray
to lighten his mother land."

150
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,560
"Pumping blood has overflown
so like the lava."

151
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,600
"Pumping blood has overflown
so like the lava."

152
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,840
"Heart is swinging like the rising sea."

153
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,840
"Hey this land I was born is
greater than heaven."

154
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,960
"I am flourished stepping
in this land today..."

155
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,160
"Salute it."

156
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,520
"Tell louder, tell louder."

157
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,760
"Pumping blood has overflown
so like the lava."

158
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,200
"Salute it."

159
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,320
"Tell louder, tell louder."

160
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,560
"Salute it."

161
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,600
"Tell louder, tell louder."

162
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,080
"Should live in loyalty,
should wipe wrong like fire."

163
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,400
"Stand for good, oppose, fight
and oppose the bad."

164
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,320
"Not just read history,
but become a history."

165
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,760
"Hey, wherever we are should
become light of this land."

166
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,880
"Our respect should be like
our never bowing flag."

167
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,160
"Salute it."

168
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,560
"Tell louder, tell louder."

169
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,840
"Pumping blood has overflown
so like the lava."

170
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,600
"Smiling Sun is come, come."

171
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,720
"He is brought festival to every heart."

172
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,560
"Salute him."

173
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,080
Salute him."

174
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,280
"Why should someone drive,
first step should be ours."

175
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,760
"Should win the war of
life transforming every second."

176
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,040
"Should believe that the valuable victory
will not come easily."

177
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,040
"The tide falling and rising back
should becoming ideal to us."

178
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,120
"Our work should be praised on all sides."

179
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,240
"Salute it."

180
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,760
"Tell louder, tell louder."

181
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,240
"Pumping blood has overflown
so like the lava."

182
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,400
"Salute it."

183
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,200
- Salutes sir.
- Salutes son.

184
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,120
- Are all fine?
- Fine son.

185
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,240
Son in law...

186
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,160
...though there came many relations
to our daughters in village...

187
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,760
...we have sat waiting to hear
your decision.

188
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,120
What is this dad?

189
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,200
All are asking you for their daughters.

190
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,080
I have said your marriage at your will.

191
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,400
It is prestige to have wealth and it is
a prestige to make you as son in law.

192
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,760
Son, we have no objection for you to marry
the daughter of any one amongst us.

193
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
But, your relations in
no way should go out of the village.

194
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,920
That lies in your hands.

195
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,720
No, it is in the hands of my mother.

196
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,240
I gave word to mom that
I would marry anyone she tells.

197
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,720
Tell mom! Which one do you want in these?

198
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,600
I want Chitti.

199
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,920
Chitti is none other than my cousin.

200
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,240
Srivalli is the one
and only sister of my father.

201
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,120
He is married her to
his childhood friend Dhanunjay.

202
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,440
Both the families have celebrated that...

203
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,000
...daughter in law of my family
was born when Chitti was born.

204
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,120
See you sister in law.

205
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,200
Come baby, let us go.

206
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,160
I will not come, I will stay with aunt.

207
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,760
Leave it, only two days right!
I will take care.

208
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,080
- Okay
- Okay! See you bro.

209
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,840
Okay, go and come.

210
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,000
Master! The car your sister was
travelling met with an accident.

211
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,240
Sister in law.

212
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,840
You have taken care of me
without mother as your daughter.

213
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,080
Even if days are changed,
men are changed...

214
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,320
...you make my daughter as
your daughter in law, right?

215
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,000
Chitti when born itself is the
daughter in law of my house sister in law!

216
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,760
From then, my mom has brought up Chitti
not like aunt, but like her daughter.

217
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,920
One day.

218
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,920
Your brother in law promised to give
documents of land to the villagers...

219
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,680
...if he is made as
the President of the Panchayat.

220
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
With the respect on you,
we made him as the President.

221
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,600
Now, he is sold that land for money
to that private company.

222
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,360
Eyes of the farmers look at the sky.

223
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,200
Eyes of the wrong look at the ground.

224
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,080
You are no more fit
for the post of President.

225
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,400
Resign now.

226
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,600
- Should resign, should resign.
- Should resign, should resign.

227
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,160
Brother.

228
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,080
To your husband who embarrassed me...

229
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,320
...without considering
as husband of his sister...

230
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,000
...and to this village,
I will show what Dhanunjay is.

231
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,720
Chitti when born itself
is the daughter in law of this house.

232
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,240
Dad!

233
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,600
Uncle leaving the village is forgotten us.

234
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,640
As sister is gone,
you too have forgotten uncle.

235
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,760
But mom is not forgotten
her word given to her sister in law, dad!

236
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,600
You are the meaning behind
the word of mother, right dad?

237
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,680
Why do you not understand mom then?

238
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,960
Please excuse me.

239
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,800
I am going to ask for my niece.

240
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,040
- Bro!
- Come bro.

241
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,240
Bro!

242
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,440
What is this wonder?
What a luck for me?

243
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,800
Friends, he is my brother in law,
head of the village.

244
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,800
- Salutes sir.
- Bro!

245
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,920
All these are my corporators.
Sit, sit, sit, sit bro sit.

246
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,960
Tell bro! What is special?

247
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,640
What else, the same one spoken already.

248
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,680
We came to ask your daughter
in marriage to son of your brother in law.

249
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,600
True? Is it true bro?

250
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,680
Hey Divakar, Damodar!
Come, all of you come.

251
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,360
Brothers! My bro has forgotten all
and came to ask for...

252
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,680
...my daughter as daughter in law
to his house.

253
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,720
Bro! How dare are you coming to
my house asking for match at my home.

254
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,240
Get up!

255
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,560
What Mr. Ramachandraiah?

256
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,560
You, who has embarrassed me
in front of all the village public...

257
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,920
...with which face have you come
to my house now.

258
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,080
Oh! Is it by seeing
the post of would be Mayor.

259
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,120
Or the wealth I have to buy you
and your entire village?

260
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,360
My daughter is the status symbol
whose hand cannot be caught even by...

261
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
...the celebrities in this entire city.

262
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,520
Where does your status stand
in front of that status....

263
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,600
...at my feet?

264
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,800
Dhanunjay!
Let your words come in respect.

265
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,600
Hey! I am not the Dhanunjay of your
village now to fear to your threats.

266
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,840
I am D brothers Chairman
and would be Mayor of Hyderabad.

267
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,840
You can calmly bow your heads
and start back to your village now.

268
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,680
And the next day came here lying
that am going to the US.

269
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,960
For the word of my mother to stand...

270
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,040
...or for the embarrassment of
my dad to be cleaned...

271
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,080
...Chitti should become
the daughter in law of our house.

272
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,520
Tell man! We are free
till the next project comes to us.

273
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,600
Let us set your project itself.

274
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,760
What shall we do now bro?

275
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,160
The daughter he feels as his status,
I should meet my cousin now.

276
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,360
All say that you fulfill
whatever is wished for in your ear.

277
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,440
Thus I am asking one wish...

278
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,680
...I do not know where
and how is the one whom I love.

279
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,480
Other matches are being searched at home.

280
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,840
You should make him and me meet.

281
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,960
You should safeguard our love.

282
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,160
Sister! Uncle is calling.

283
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,240
God bless you.

284
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,920
Priest sir!
Now a days, our time does not look good.

285
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,200
Mayor post has just almost come
and gone for our brother.

286
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,520
That is not your mistake.

287
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,080
An itching planet has entered
into the life of your brother.

288
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,560
This reaction is the reflection of that.

289
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,920
Itching planet means?

290
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,600
Dhanunjay sir! Are you seeing
any matches for your daughter?

291
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,280
We are trying for the match of
KFC Naidu in America.

292
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,400
Rain once clouds come and girl once
the age comes cannot be stopped by none...

293
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,200
...let that marriage be done. Else,
your daughter by then with someone--

294
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,160
Hey! All three brothers should
like even a kerchief...

295
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,640
...is to be brought for my daughter.

296
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,840
Similarly, the one to marry her
should first be liked by us.

297
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,520
If someone loves my daughter
we will give him four and give a warning.

298
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,080
Similarly, if she loves someone
we would chop his legs and hands.

299
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,200
What baby?

300
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,640
Chitti is coming to here
for aerobic classes.

301
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,320
- Let us go and see what Chitti is doing.
- Okay man!

302
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,160
What is this bro, we safeguarding
when ladies are exercising?

303
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,480
Is it not enough of getting beated up
with him, this is safe for us.

304
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,440
You shut up.

305
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,240
Bro, he is the one bro.

306
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,080
Oh God! What is his entry just
by thinking, what is this jump?

307
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,040
Call to whom man?

308
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,600
To brothers,
if they know that this guy is found.

309
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,520
You bloody!

310
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,400
What would he do by knowing?
He would send us again to hit him.

311
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,200
What would he do, beat us again.

312
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,840
Not just us but would go
and beat brothers too.

313
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,840
Eating the salt of brothers for ten years
and getting them hit is wrong, right?

314
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,800
- Wrong bro.
- You understood easily.

315
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,320
Thus brothers will not know
that he is the one...

316
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,600
...and we will also not tell.
Lets join hands!

317
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,720
Oh I see! Would be super
if even my cousin is like this girl!

318
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,680
Look, how have the boys changed
their walking style by seeing us.

319
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,200
Their feeling is that girls would
fall in their laps by seeing them.

320
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,320
She has fallen in the lap, what is she?

321
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,480
Girl in age would fall so
if favouring time comes.

322
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,680
They are safe!

323
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,320
How dare you, you catch me?

324
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,520
What is wrong? We would catch
if a glass doll is falling from up.

325
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,040
How could we be without catching...

326
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,400
...when a beautiful girl is falling down?
What man?

327
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,760
- Yes bro.
- You boys are so man...

328
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,880
...you always would be waiting
to see girls falling and catch.

329
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,240
Hey, you seem to be going
a bit too much.

330
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,800
What will you do man?
What will you do?

331
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,880
You are not even as much as a carrot
and you catch my collar?

332
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,360
Hey, hey girl man, leave her.

333
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Is this a girl man?

334
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,920
Listen to us. Let us go.

335
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,360
You do not know about me man,
be seen again somewhere.

336
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,880
If I get mood in the mid night will drink
three beers and come to your house.

337
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,320
Come, come
I will get you bit by the dogs.

338
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Hey, get off! Have seen many--

339
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,000
- You--
- Hey, come on!

340
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,560
- Where is daughter of Dhanunjay, madam?
- She is just left, sir.

341
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,040
By mistake, is that not my cousin
with whom I put a fight?

342
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,000
Here is the house of my uncle.

343
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,560
I will jump the wall
and have a look once of my cousin.

344
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
My cousin was bubbly
and cute in childhood...

345
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,840
Do not know how she looks now?

346
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,440
Hey Laxmi, where are you?

347
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,440
Keeping milk in the room of
madam and coming.

348
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,280
Room of madam means
the room of my cousin.

349
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,720
Oh, may be taking bath.

350
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,880
Is the time correct?
Hey, she is my cousin and okay.

351
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,040
Seeing my cousin for the first time...

352
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,960
...and I should see only her face
and nothing else.

353
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,200
- Hello!
- Hi Bhagyam madam!

354
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,400
I love you madam.

355
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,320
Bharani! How many times shall I tell you
that I will not love any one...

356
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,720
..and I do not like love?

357
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,040
Don't say that.

358
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,760
Please understand me,
ours too is a good family madam.

359
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,600
Look I will not go for love marriage...

360
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,680
...will anytime go for the
arranged marriage set by my father only.

361
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,280
Love will not set for this Bhagyam...

362
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,040
..and you will not set for me. Okay bye.

363
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,400
Oh! Name of my cousin is
Bhagyam then. Wow!

364
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,200
What a luck for me,

365
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,080
I will make you fall for me,
you who does not like love.

366
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,880
Gave my room as you said to get ready and
come out fast. Are you still not ready?

367
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,880
Friends have already come to the party.

368
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,800
I am ready.

369
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Have you seen?

370
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,240
How is she?

371
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,920
- She is like the 'Ugadi pickle'.
- Thank you.

372
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,840
Your Chitti is studying
at Mallareddy college it seems, man.

373
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,800
Then we shall join
that college tomorrow itself.

374
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,240
Who would give the seat so sudden?

375
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,360
Seat is needed for studying,
why for just sighting man?

376
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,120
Move!

377
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,200
Hello.

378
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,680
Hello Bhagyam madam!
I love you.

379
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,000
Why are you troubling me like this?

380
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,120
Why do you follow me
even I said many times...

381
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,440
...that I do not like either you or love?

382
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,840
- Never call me again.
- Hey, please listen!

383
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,240
Poor guy Bhagyam.
That guy deeply loves you from two years.

384
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Why do you not accept him?

385
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,640
Love in my view is not two moving
together before marriage.

386
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,680
It is two hearts understanding
each other after marriage.

387
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,840
Oh my!

388
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,960
That is why I hate love stories.

389
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,400
Those giving such speeches would
all of a sudden slip from basement...

390
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,720
...and fall flat in love
when the right guy enters.

391
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,880
Me?

392
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,760
The guy who makes this Bhagyam fall
in love is not there in this college...

393
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,960
...and will not come.

394
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,120
What is this guy here?

395
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,680
I am packing all my love
in this gift pack and giving you...

396
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,640
...if you like it keep safely.
If you do not like slap me harder...

397
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,440
...but do not say no to my love.

398
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,200
Is this your brother?

399
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,440
Thought he is your brother.

400
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,120
Stop these links
and tell what your way is?

401
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,200
Is it for studying or for sighting,
why have you come to college?

402
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,960
He is surely come for you.

403
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,680
- Boys.
- Yes boss.

404
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
Look at each student in the college.

405
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,160
Check each page in their books
and each message.

406
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,440
Who is with whom,
I want the full details.

407
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,080
We will put all in and beat up.
Come on move.

408
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,840
Yes boss.

409
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,920
Give them here.

410
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,200
9 8 4 9 2 2 4 3 4 3.

411
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,160
What for?

412
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,400
Good for something, keep quiet.

413
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,840
Okay, next

414
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,440
Stop it!

415
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,640
Is this college or a pub?
What is happening here?

416
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,000
Hey, what work do you have here?

417
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,280
Why are you here?

418
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,000
What is this T-shirt showing your
shoulders and skirt above your knees?

419
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,720
Coming to our college
and you comment us.

420
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,440
Who are you man?

421
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,120
Who? He is the head of
the anti lovers squad.

422
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,040
Yes!

423
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,040
Anti lovers squad?

424
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,480
Anti lovers squad?

425
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,800
Anti lovers squad?

426
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,680
Yes!

427
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,920
As there were complaints that class
percentage in this college is come down...

428
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,720
..and lovers percentage is gone up...

429
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,920
...we were sent here from up.

430
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,800
From today, only clevers should be
in this college and not lovers.

431
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,920
Because, I hate love stories!

432
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,560
Same to same like me.

433
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,880
Is it connected?

434
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
Connected very well.

435
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,920
From tomorrow, if you come in bad dresses
to college will peel off your skins.

436
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,960
No shorts, no sleeveless...

437
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,920
...all should be full.

438
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,200
There would be a girl in this college
fully dressed moving like a goddess...

439
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,600
...what is the name of that girl?

440
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,960
Bhagyam.

441
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,560
Yes! That Bhagyam.

442
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,320
Learn seeing that girl.
How should a girl be?

443
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,400
Should show as if not showing, shall give
just a glance of the waist part only.

444
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,840
Basically all girls together
follow that girl.

445
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,760
That Bhagyam was follow me only.

446
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,400
What are your bloody rules
in our college man?

447
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,560
I will complaint to the Principal.

448
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,520
Go tell girl.

449
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,040
Even if he has some accounts,
we shall push him too inside.

450
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:29,920
Sir.

451
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,360
Someone has come with four...

452
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,560
...and saying anti lovers squad
and fighting with our students sir.

453
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,040
Is it girl? Yes girl!

454
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,480
What he said is right.

455
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,080
As per the orders from up that
all students in our college...

456
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,360
...are turning lovers...

457
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,760
...we have brought him
as anti lovers squad.

458
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Still, what is this rule newly
at our college only sir?

459
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,560
That is GO, Government order.

460
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
This is my GO girl,
Go baby. Go, go, go.

461
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,840
What sir, Is it really an order from up?

462
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,000
Order or bloody crap?

463
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,720
That guy came to my house yesterday.

464
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,520
Gave your entry so sharp,
who are you boys?

465
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Not just entry sir, we too are sharp.

466
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,640
Very good! What do you want?

467
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,560
Simple sir, me and my friends want jobs
in your college sir.

468
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,680
- There are no jobs in my college man.
- No problem sir!

469
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,680
We shall create some jobs
and we ourselves would enter the college.

470
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,960
- No salary.
- Service free.

471
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,040
Why boy?

472
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,360
I need to make a girl
in your college flat sir. That is why!

473
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,000
What are you talking?

474
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,280
For you to make a girl flat...

475
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,640
...you yourselves would create jobs
and tell me...

476
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,160
...who am a strict Principal?

477
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,760
Get out boys!

478
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,160
Bloody to hell with the life!

479
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,240
Have looted from childhood, done strikes,
done Rowdyism, Goondaism...

480
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,640
...and finally grew to a stage of murders
for the monthly maintenance.

481
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,480
Thought to change my crime story
to a love story to be refreshed...

482
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,640
...for that I need a lover, right sir?

483
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,920
Needed son!

484
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,880
You are a Principal
who does not change principles.

485
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,600
That Gallareddy college Principal who
bends for money is better than you sir.

486
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,440
He gives many jobs if hit with money.

487
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,080
There is girl named Padmavathi there.

488
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,440
I will keep trying for that girl
and spend my life sir.

489
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,520
Stop boy!

490
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,720
Why would I let you go to that college...

491
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,400
...who is with so many qualities
and eligibilities?

492
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,960
You are appointed in my college.

493
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,320
Thanks sir!

494
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,440
Still, why did you give a job
in our college to such a cheater sir?

495
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,840
That Padmavathi is none other than
my daughter.

496
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,760
Sir.

497
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,120
Hi, Indu.

498
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,160
How is your new family at Canada?

499
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,480
Very happy.

500
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,760
Hi, Indu!
How far has your love story come?

501
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,120
There is no proper response
how much ever I try to that phone.

502
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,400
At home, they are in search of matches.

503
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,360
I feel tensed thinking whether
I would succeed in my love or not.

504
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,120
Do not worry!
There is honesty in your love.

505
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,120
You would definitely
find the one you loved.

506
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,600
Do not lose your hope.

507
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,280
Hope is the only thing I have.

508
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,080
Bye Purvi!

509
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,320
Bye.

510
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,120
Hello.

511
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,800
Hello I am Indu.

00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,800
His phone number or address at you.

513
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,760
Madam! How many times shall
I tell you that I do not know about him.

514
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,680
Please sir!

515
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,160
Actually he is very important for my life.

516
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,680
Here, Even our work is important,
do not disturb us every time by calling.

517
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,560
If I get to know about him,
I will call you.

518
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,440
Oh God! I should change
this number urgently...

519
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,240
...her problem does not look to go away.

520
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,160
When would you be seen,
for whom I have been searching?

521
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,640
We felt that he made us eat
the ground once, right?

522
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,240
Yes brother.

523
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,440
Poor brother!
Look how he is making him eat grass?

524
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,400
What is this brother?

525
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,920
It does not look good for you to be eating
grass when we are all eating non veg.

526
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,600
Added you like non veg
very much too brother.

527
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,400
I liked Mayor post too, has it come?

528
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,000
Till I find the one who spilt that--

529
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,720
I will eat only grass.

530
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,560
We will not tell,
he will not be caught...

531
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,920
...means is the grass lifelong
for brother?

532
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,400
He is hurting brother so much,
where would he be enjoying now?

533
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
What? Has he changed
so much just in a single day?

534
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,320
Karthik sir.

535
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,200
Hello Karthik sir!

536
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,240
What Varun, angry on me?

537
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,240
You are not talking
for two days with me...

538
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,560
- Karthik sir!
- ...what happened to you?

539
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,680
Sorry Lavanya!
To love outside, problem with dad...

540
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,840
...and to love at college problem
with the squad.

541
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,040
That is why we shall drop.

542
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,960
How if you say to drop now,
when we were in love from so long?

543
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,840
Idiot.

544
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,680
Have you thought what happens to
the girl who loved you all these days...

545
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,800
...by saying break up as of now?

546
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,800
Come to me.

547
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,360
- Sir.
- Hey!

548
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,000
Have you thought
what happens to the girl...

549
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,400
...who loved you all these days
by saying break up as of now?

550
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,960
Sir, you are anti love squad, right?

551
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,840
Yes!

552
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,760
I will not tell anything
to the ones in love like you.

553
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Only pain is where you spoil
by neglecting studies falling in love.

554
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,520
Cool down Karthik, cool down.

555
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,240
Love is a beautiful feel you enjoy
before marriage, man.

556
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,040
But after marriage
Love means it is not love...

557
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,120
...it is an adjustment.

558
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,560
Is it?

559
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,880
Thats why
I will encourage the real lovers...

560
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,920
...we are get any problems
from your parents then tell me.

561
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,680
I will handle yours marriage.

562
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,520
- Thank you sir.
- Thank you sir.

563
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,160
Carryon my boy.

564
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,320
Karthik sir!

565
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,880
It is you Karthik sir!

566
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,600
- Where is she?
- Why do you not stop when I am calling?

567
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,880
Karthik sir!

568
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,040
You speak to all in the college
other than me. Why so?

569
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,960
It is different speaking with all
and speaking with you.

570
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,200
You are talking so strong
about love means...

571
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,080
...are you impressed by seeing any girl?

572
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,480
What now madam, I was impresses seeing
a girl in my Seventh class itself.

573
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,600
In seventh class?

574
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,600
Yes Madam.

575
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,080
I was studying at upper primary school
at Sanath Nagar then.

576
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,560
Then only I felt for a girl by seeing.

577
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,920
I too have studied in that school.

578
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,560
- Who is that girl?
- You know that girl very well.

579
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,200
You were five friends then.

580
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,720
- Ganga.
- No.

581
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,120
- Sravani.
- No.

582
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,720
Okay, Latha.

583
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,840
- No.
- Madhurima.

584
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
No way!

585
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,600
Later that girl has joined Ameerpet
high school to study Tenth class...

586
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,800
...and I too have joined
along with her there.

587
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,080
Is it? I too did my Tenth class there.

588
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,040
You five were friends even there.

589
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,200
- Rekha.
- No.

590
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,440
- Surekha.
- No.

591
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,080
- Chandralekha. Chitralekha.
- No.

592
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,920
Then who if not them?

593
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,920
You are saying only four names,
whenever you say...

594
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,760
but why do you not tell
the name of that fifth girl?

595
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,440
Fifth girl?

596
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,280
What, that is me!

597
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,360
Sorry!

598
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,280
What Bhagyam?
You are in such a josh?

599
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,120
Indu! First time,
I am impressed by seeing a guy.

600
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,480
You are impressed?

601
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,240
Yes.

602
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,520
he seems to have been following
from Seventh class.

603
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,440
Who is that lucky fellow?

604
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,120
So, boys and girls.

605
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,600
- Hey boys, all of you come this side.
- Fast, fast.

606
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,200
That guy.

607
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,440
What, this guy?

608
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,280
Will tell let him come.

609
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,120
What man? Who does not even care
about anybody in the college.

610
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,800
You tell cock and bull stories of
Seventh class and tenth class to Bhagyam.

611
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,760
You in real came to this college
as anti lovers squad...

612
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,680
...or to impress girls?

613
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,480
She might have felt bad as
I did not love her.

614
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,720
Hey, she is like ice and melt very fast.

615
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,000
I am like iron, will not melt.

616
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,840
If you have guts, impress me man.
Lets see.

617
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,480
Hey, here is iron lady,
do you want her.

618
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,320
Hey!

619
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,600
What is this nonsense
Bhagyam madam.

620
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,000
You will forced me to reveal
my flash-bag right?

621
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,840
Developed love on
my Bhagyam from childhood.

622
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,960
But I understood after coming here
that she hates love.

623
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,120
I respected your feelings
and killed my feelings.

624
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,960
Why do you think i do not respond even
when you call me Bhagyam madam?

625
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,320
With fear that...

626
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,120
...I may hurt saying the words you don't
like to hear in some weak moment.

627
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,800
But, what have you done?
You made your friend scold me this day.

628
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,680
I am hurt Bhagyam madam,
I am really hurt.

629
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,880
Karthik sir!

630
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,880
You do not need to give
explanations to anyone for me.

631
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,360
We can make someone believe
a marriage by tying knot...

632
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,280
...but this society will not believe
love even by building Tajmahal.

633
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,080
Hey! Love will not suit for you, right?

634
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,720
I did not like chicken as a kid...

635
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,960
...and now I do not swallow
food without a piece.

636
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,600
Wishes also change like the seasons.

637
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,360
Still, there would be a hundred
between me and Karthik sir...

638
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,840
...you do not involve in them.

639
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,920
Karthik sir! Please you do not get hurt.

640
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,400
Very very thanks.

641
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,640
I was tensed in thoughts to know what
exactly was Bhagyam feeling about me?

642
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,840
You had unnecessarily mingled
and pushed it.

643
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,560
Making her get
a super impression on me.

644
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,040
As far as I know, love angle would
have started on me by now.

645
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,040
See you.

646
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,440
"Devil devil throwing me like
a rubber ball."

647
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,320
"You do not go throwing
and throwing smiles."

648
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,200
"Devil devil throwing me like
a rubber ball."

649
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,400
"My lucky girl!"

650
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,280
"Like a pure Telugu girl and a fresh
pickle piece. With a cheese piece talk."

651
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,280
"Do not make an iron piece like
boy move around you as a puppy."

652
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,320
"Like a pure Telugu girl and a fresh
pickle piece. With a cheese piece talk."

653
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,800
Life without you is
a play without colour."

654
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,200
"It is a tasteless dish of
fish curry without salt."

655
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,680
"Life without you is
the youth without bike."

656
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,040
"Dancing in club in
the night without girls."

657
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,040
"Heart breaking like the cracking papad."

658
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,920
"Devil devil throwing me
like a rubber ball."

659
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,480
"You do not go throwing
and throwing smiles."

660
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:56,320
"Wrote love letter in this air and water.
Pasted wall poster in the way you go."

661
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,600
"Shall I write and give suicide letter
not able to see my happiness."

662
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,760
"Knew your need
by consuming Cyanide."

663
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:09,160
"Hey with thousand eyes twinkling
waited how much."

664
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,160
"Hey like this how many days
love beat of heart may stop."

665
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,720
"Life without you is to be clean bowled.
To be out at one run before a century."

666
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,040
"Life without you is like a dust bin."

667
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,480
"Raising the waste coke tin
in air and kicking."

668
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,560
"Kicking like foot ball
and kicking hard."

669
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,400
"Devil devil throwing me like
a rubber ball."

670
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,200
"You do not go throwing
and throwing smiles."

671
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,320
"My lucky girl!"

672
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,080
"My lucky girl!"

673
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,000
"Hey none can make gold."

674
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,840
"Even the God Brahma can never sculpt
a beauty more than you."

675
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,160
"Hey your name is rolled gold
you five feet white crow."

676
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,920
"Nobody asks even
if you move wearing pant and shirt."

677
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,280
"Hey let me be twinkling so as
a couple with you lifelong."

678
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,920
"For my dream to come true let
the time stop as it is."

679
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,600
"Life without you is astrology
without sun sign."

680
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,000
"Like keeping feet on a blasting bullet."

681
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,440
"Life without you is like
heating up the body."

682
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,720
"To get water out from the oasis well."

683
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,880
"To get the sun stroke
and bark like a crow."

684
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,720
"Devil devil throwing me like
a rubber ball."

685
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,520
"You do not go throwing
and throwing smiles."

686
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,200
"Devil devil throwing me like
a rubber ball."

687
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,680
This is all his sketch.

688
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,600
He is tried to impress for Bhagyam.

689
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,880
Indu, now the love school of
boys is different.

690
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,400
To try one girl, they are first trying
the friend beside her.

691
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,800
Their plan is that then she herself
would get jealous and say I love you.

692
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,080
Looks like this mad girl
would fall for his magic.

693
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,240
Have you seen Karthik?

694
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,560
We have not seen.

695
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,360
Okay! I will see him.

696
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,400
Breaking news just coming in!

697
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,640
Bhagyam is searching for our
Karthik in the entire college, man!

698
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,920
That Indu it seems is trying to
damage your image at Bhagyam, man.

699
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,280
She look like a tight dress is
put on to a diet coke, bloody.

700
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,560
If she comes know that
we came here for Bhagyam.

701
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,480
Would die shivering like
a monkey touching the transformer.

702
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,560
We must see her face then man.

703
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,560
Look then!

704
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,920
I will open up your whole workout
in front of Bhagyam.

705
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,680
I will break up your love.

706
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,360
Please Indu! Do not disturb the plan
worked with so much of hard work.

707
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,360
Please, Indu, please.

708
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,160
Please, will not set for your face man!

709
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,040
Indu..

710
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,080
What happened Karthik,
why are you like that?

711
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,480
You know who is my enemy?

712
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,440
Who else, Indu?

713
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,120
Do you know what has Indu done?

714
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,880
She said I love you to me.

715
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,240
Is it so?

716
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,120
Even I am shocked like you.

717
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,600
But my friends are saying the figure
looks good, why not get committed?

718
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,320
But my heart is not arraying.

719
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,320
Because we shall see only the heart in the
girl we are in love, but not her figure.

720
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,000
Only the girl with beautiful heart
knows who exactly is in.

721
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,920
One more thing Bhagyam...

722
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,760
The loved ones should be seen
with the heart and not with the eyes.

723
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,120
Bhagyam! Entire facts of that
Karthik fellow are out...

724
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,280
- ...he came to college for--
- Will you stop?

725
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,840
What exactly do you know about Karthik?

726
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,960
Karthik is not to be seen with eyes,
with heart.

727
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
What happened?

728
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,960
Shall I basically tell one thing with you.

729
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,120
You cannot put obstacles between us.

730
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,720
Because i am the hero in this story
and she is the heroine...

731
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,960
...yours just the character of friend
of the heroine.

732
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,320
friend character should stay as
a friend character...

733
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,160
...but if you go on throwing
foolish cassettes.

734
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,600
Later hero will have
to play the villain role.

735
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
Then start the kabadi to your character.

736
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,760
To tell about your role in a raw,
clear way.

737
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,760
After our marriage spreading flowers
on the first night bed.

738
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,680
And taking care of the kids
after they born, it is similar to a nanny.

739
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,920
So you completely get involved
into your role and live in it.

740
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,800
Hey Karthik idiot! I should come with
the tsunami to blow you away.

741
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,960
Obulreddy sir.

742
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,320
Sorry, your brother will not come out
from coma. You can take him home.

743
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,160
Hey!

744
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,160
To take my brother from here,
I should get the one who hit him.

745
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,280
When someone wanted O positive blood,
why should I give blood, man?

746
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,400
Shut your mouth and move.

747
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,760
When you say with so much respect,
why will I not give, I will.

748
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,880
Nobody should ever miss what is in hands
and what comes into the hands.

749
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,960
Take care.

750
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,320
Thanks.

751
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,320
Tell baby! Who is irritating you?

752
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,600
I will fold, fold him up.

753
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,000
It is him.

754
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,200
From today, he should
not just fear to baby, but any girl.

755
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,880
Come on take out weapons fellows.

756
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,840
- Attack!
- Yes!

757
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,720
Why has the total family
attached to him, man?

758
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,480
What man? Seen after so many days!

759
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,000
That is... race brother. Running race.

760
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,600
Whoever touches you first from us,
he is like the winner.

761
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,480
Here, here I touched him,
I touched him, me, me!

762
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,880
- Lets go.
- Idiot!

763
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,560
Idiot! If you do bloody comedy before me,
you will be broken.

764
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,680
Tell what the matter is!

765
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,560
Nothing brother,
a girl has sent to beat you up.

766
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,880
Which girl?

767
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,680
Professional ethics brother,
should not tell.

768
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,360
Oh it is you sketch.

769
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,720
What man, came to kill me as
I am loving your madam?

770
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,800
Is this guy loving our madam?

771
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,760
Means, it is a puncture now
for the total family.

772
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,720
Salute brother! See you.

773
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,080
Came to beat me
and you are leaving now.

774
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,240
Come on brother! How can we hit you?
We are friends, right.

775
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,400
When is it from?

776
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,800
That is from the day you gave
the introduction, from then.

777
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,360
But, as per the duty of your profession,
you should hit me, right?

778
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,280
Oh no! Your plan is to beat us up
if we touch you. We will not touch.

779
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,480
I will touch you,
if you do not touch me.

780
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,480
What is this fitting?

781
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,880
When we are saying will not hit you,
why do you pressurise us?

782
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,840
Will you hit or get hit?

783
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,960
Okay, you should not hit back
even when we hit you.

784
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,200
If you are okay with this, we are ready.

785
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,240
- Okay!
- Seems okay man!

786
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,560
Hey caught correctly man!

787
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,960
We can clear the entire revenge
we have on him today.

788
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,880
Okay, we are ready, hey come on!

789
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,480
Why you are don't use this offer.

790
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,240
This time we all together would use.

791
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,160
Beat him.

792
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,880
Do not leave him.

793
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,760
Bhagyam, Bhagyam!

794
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,640
Karthik, Indu is getting him hit
with men as he is not loving him.

795
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,120
Hey hit him.

796
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,360
Hit.

797
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,240
Stop man, all this is a plan.

798
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,560
Karthik!

799
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,880
If the fact that you loved me
from Seventh class is true...

800
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,080
...none should cross the college gate.

801
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,680
Who is this character newly man?

802
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,960
What is this love angle again?

803
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,200
May be a triangle brother.

804
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,800
If our Tenth class love
is to be successful...

805
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,240
...hit these bloody idiots hardly.

806
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,680
Why do you simulate him mother?
What do you know about him?

807
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,960
If he gets up.

808
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,200
Why did he get up three times?

809
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,160
Karthik, do not leave even one.

810
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,360
I created this action
for this reaction only man.

811
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,000
Now starts the real action.

812
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,720
Are you satisfied madam?

813
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,440
Karthik!

814
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,840
Karthik!

815
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,080
Yes! You will do anything for me.
You will stand against any number.

816
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,440
I love you Karthik.

817
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,400
What bro, not getting kick
how much ever you drink?

818
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,800
What kick is there in this man?

819
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,000
That Bhagyam has said I love you
falling to the sketch of us, right?

820
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,240
Kick was in that.

821
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,800
Looking at that that rabbit faced
Indu had boiled, kick was in that.

822
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,640
Why is this matter about Indu
in either happiness or pain man?

823
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,960
You should not every now and
then think about other ladies man.

824
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,760
She is not woman,
but always roasted up iron.

825
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,680
Come you. Come.

826
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,480
You always enter at the right timing.

827
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,160
If you feel so much just for
Bhagyam falling for me...

828
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,120
...what would you do
by knowing the real facts?

829
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,960
In real I came to college
just to make her fall for me.

830
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,320
Play Football, kabaddi
like games with her father...

831
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,880
...and if I do not make him fall
on my feet and lick the ground!

832
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,040
Bhagyam, that is, that is--

833
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,800
Tomorrow is Vinayaka chaviti, right?

834
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,800
For that we are rehearsing
a play named Bhagyam I love you...

835
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,400
- What man?
- Yes dude!

836
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,560
Even Bhagyam has an expressive face.
Let us give the heroine roll.

837
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,240
It is been four days past
Vinayaka Chaviti.

838
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,280
If not for Vinayaka chavithi, then
for Vijayadasami, you shut your mouth.

839
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,880
Play is important,
is the festival important, Bhagyam?

840
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,200
Now stop your dramas...

841
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,400
- ...you play football with my dad?
- Bhagyam.

842
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,520
- You make my dad lick the ground?
- Bhagyam.

843
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,000
What do you think of my dad?

844
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,320
Village people stand in queues
in front of our house for him.

845
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,560
You say such a great man so many words?

846
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,440
- Hello Bharani!
- Hi, Bhagyam madam.

847
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,560
I did not recognise your love falling
in the magic of an idiot.

848
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,560
Is that true?

849
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,440
- I love you.
- Miss Bhagyam!

850
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,000
Indu, you are
the correct one for this guy.

851
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,560
Bhagyam.

852
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,360
Bhagyam.

853
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,560
What man?
You are the hero and she is the heroine...

854
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,280
...where is your heroine man?

855
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,560
Not just her but will disturb anyone
you fall in love with.

856
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,280
I will see to that you will not have
love and marriage, both in your life.

857
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,640
See you.

858
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,680
Stop you.

859
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,640
Hey, what shall I do with this devil that
has broken my almost successful love.

860
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,520
What shall we tell
if you ask us so suddenly?

861
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,160
What would you do, man?
If at all you would sip one beer.

862
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,920
Hello KFC Naidu sir, what is up sir?

863
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:20,040
Okay, okay thank you very much.
Good news!

864
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,880
Hey Indu!

865
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,920
It seems, son of KFC Naidu is
become flat by seeing you in facebook.

866
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,680
My dream to have a match with
the family of KFC is fulfilling today.

867
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,040
Thank God, at least this happiness is
left for brother.

868
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,040
Sorry dad, I will not marry right now.

869
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,440
Even this happiness is gone for brother.

870
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,120
They are the rich guys whom
we do not get even if we want...

871
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,920
...we should get the knot tied
when they feel love.

872
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,760
Tell man!

873
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,640
- Say okay baby.
- Say okay.

874
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,120
I like KFC chicken very much, please.

875
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,440
Stop it, I will tell
when I feel like marrying.

876
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,240
Look, she is feeling
uncomfortable to tell to us...

877
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,680
...you find out what
she has in her heart.

878
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,880
Okay uncle!

879
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,080
When such a great match is seen,
why do you miss it?

880
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,040
I am already loving a person.

881
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,240
You are in love? Who is that guy?

882
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,440
He is--

883
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,360
He is--

884
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,920
He is none other than the anti lovers
squad Karthik in our college.

885
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,200
What is this twist?

886
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,760
Thought only for brothers,
is he the husband even for madam now?

887
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,040
What is it that you are loving Karthik.

888
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,440
When Karthik is loving me so madly...

889
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,440
...and I too am loving him the same.

890
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,080
If Karthik opposes
my parents for my love...

891
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,960
...I would marry him.

892
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,840
If Karthik fears to our parents...

893
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,040
I will then fix to the match
seen by my parents.

894
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,560
I will show him how fierce is the fear.

895
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,080
- Saidulu.
- Brother.

896
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,320
What I need now is not the one
who hit on my post...

897
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,920
...but the one who wanted to catch
the hand of my daughter.

898
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,120
Anti lover squad fellow Karthik
of the college it seems.

899
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,840
Play Kabaddi with his body.

900
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,920
Now not just God
but even I cannot save this family.

901
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,840
Yes.

902
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,160
What are these dramas saying
that you loved Karthik?

903
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,600
This is the villainy revenge
I have over him.

904
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,080
Oh, no! Don't beat me!

905
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,760
Hey! How dare you love
Dhanunjay sir's daughter?

906
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,080
Don't let him go. Catch him.

907
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,000
Don't live them.

908
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,800
What man, has the action started?

909
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,760
What is your over action?

910
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,680
I have done that at my dad.

911
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,920
I said I have love on you.

912
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,480
Have you gone any mad?

913
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,960
Sketch.

914
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,240
If my dad comes to know
that I loved someone...

915
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,680
...he would crack the hands
and legs of that guy.

916
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,080
I see,
is your dad such powerful?

917
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,560
He is great.
Do you know who my dad is?

918
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,200
D brothers chairman, Dhanunjay.

919
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,760
What is it?
He is the father of Bhagyam, right?

920
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,720
For you, brain along with love gone bad.

921
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,760
Dad of Bhagyam is an RMP doctor.

922
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,920
RMP Doctor?

923
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,360
What do you think of my dad?

924
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,560
Do you know people stand
in queue at my house for my dad?

925
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,760
Means,
this is my cousin...

926
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,920
...without her information
she put Bhagyam on side track...

927
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,640
...and has herself
come on to the main track.

928
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,840
Super, man!

929
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,680
What man, voice is become silence?

930
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,280
Goons coming now would beat you up.

931
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,160
Will get beaten up if the hit,
ask them to come now.

932
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,080
Your wish too would be done.

933
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,520
It is done, right?

934
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,160
There is a meaning
then to the kiss given in anger.

935
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:28,800
What, man?

936
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,120
That fellows of Dhanunjay are
beating us up man!

937
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,760
Stop!

938
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,080
He and this guy are the same man.

939
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,640
Why to wait
when you got the clarity of being same?

940
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,840
Oh God! He has come.

941
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,840
Where are those three idiots?

942
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,040
Hey Dhanunjay!

943
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,960
You seem to break those
whom your daughter loves, right?

944
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,800
Due to your bad luck, she is loved me.

945
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,480
Right my beloved!

946
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,840
What girl, you lied to love me, right?

947
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,160
I will make that lie a true
and show you.

948
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,840
I fell for you with the kiss
I gave day before.

949
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,560
You need a clarity
also from my side, so--

950
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,960
Indhu!

951
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,640
I love you.

952
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,680
How dare are you?

953
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,040
You come to my house and say
I love you to my daughter in front of me?

954
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,400
Hey! Break him up man!

955
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,480
Brothers! Now you cannot escape
the beatings.

956
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,120
Stop man!

957
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,920
Stop man! Stop man! Stop man!

958
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,920
Hey, anyways
we are beating each other...

959
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,440
...so let me give you another clarity
from my side now.

960
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,400
The one for whom you
have been eagerly waiting for to see....

961
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,560
...I am the one.

962
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,040
Not understood!

963
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,960
I was the one putting check
to your post.

964
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,560
Hey! Close the doors man.

965
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,960
The one I had been searching for
has come in search of his death himself.

966
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,480
He is stood in front of me,
kill him man!

967
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,400
This is what the emotion
I wanted, man!

968
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:06,880
Brother!

969
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,320
Brother! Oh God!

970
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,480
Brother!

971
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,120
Do you know who am I in real?

972
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,080
I am the son of Ramachandraiah.

973
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,680
I am saying in the same house,
where my father was embarrassed.

974
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,040
I will make you catch
the feet of my father...

975
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,160
...and with the same hands
I will make you clean my feet...

976
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,760
...and sprinkle that
water on your head. If not...

977
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,040
...nothing like that...

978
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,040
...it will happen for sure.

979
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,600
I will become the husband of
your pampered daughter...

980
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,040
...and become the son in law of
this house you built with your pride.

981
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,560
I will become so called husband to...

982
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,800
...all you three brothers swinging
with cholesterol.

983
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,480
"Hot hot parrot as you scratched me."

984
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,680
"Your dad knows
the hit that banged in sound."

985
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,600
"Barampuram bell you kept a great twist."

986
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,760
"Now the love bell will ring
in your heart."

987
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:29,120
"Mustache like a mine,
anger like the salt grave."

988
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,600
"Seen the dare of breaking bones,
saluted with you."

989
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,320
"Hey will like a man and elope you."

990
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,160
"Will see who comes in the way
and will break if comes."

991
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,960
"Will beat up and down
and show my power."

992
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,800
"The back stopping me
will be banged up badly."

993
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,520
"Hot hot parrot as you scratched me."

994
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,520
"Your dad knows
the hit that banged in sound."

995
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,240
"Come you fire ball,
your beauty is fire flower."

996
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,040
"Will you not let me weigh you
and give my kiss."

997
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,880
"The soup of shame
and do not let it be dropped mister."

998
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,840
"Your poking mustache,
can you not stop for a while."

999
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:33,360
"Hey girl, you lit me up like
the passing current."

1000
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:38,880
"Like the itch you gave love like
to die with irritation in heart."

1001
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:44,360
"Hey man, have me weighed.
Mass kissing sack in class touch."

1002
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,400
"Play the lip game as the only work."

1003
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,960
"Like the in laws house
shiver in resound."

1004
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,760
"I am rising up, shall I come for a ride."

1005
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,560
Hey, I am a pure boy,
marriage is confirmed."

1006
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,720
"Shall I give your body
a saree and blouse."

1007
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,840
"Hey hot milk pot, my heart cute boy."

1008
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,640
"Empty it without putting any hole."

1009
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,480
"I will straighten the fold
catching your sleek waist."

1010
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,200
"I will hit your love pot, hey be ready."

1011
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:45,800
"Sounding cutely,
you ripened some shy flower buds."

1012
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:51,640
"Catching like a shirt,
you put holes to the entire heart."

1013
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:56,680
"Boy like the thermo meter.
Son in law to swallow it."

1014
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,880
"By just seeing you,
I start slipping my leg."

1015
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,560
"Hey shall I attack suddenly on
the lightening string."

1016
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,360
"Shall I catch your shine
and enjoy in pride."

1017
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,200
"Hey I am the boy like the thunder,
shall I come chasing you."

1018
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,480
"Hey Girl Sindrona,
there is no better guy than me."

1019
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,840
Dad! I had not loved him.

1020
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:35,080
I said a small lie to have loved him
with the anger on him.

1021
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,840
You said a lie. Crap, you got the crap
and put on the head.

1022
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,960
Stop man!

1023
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,720
We are safe when Indu had loved him.

1024
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,800
Everyone in this city would pass urine
by seeing us...

1025
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,200
...but that guy has come to our house
and made us pass urine.

1026
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,480
To hit the enemy,
we should meet hands with the enemy.

1027
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,920
Only man to hit him is Obul Reddy, man!

1028
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:56,400
Deal of Obul Reddy is over,
send the amount.

1029
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,360
Obul Reddy!

1030
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,720
For the marriage of my daughter...

1031
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,640
...I put our rivalry aside
and came for your support.

1032
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,200
Take the ladies inside.

1033
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,000
Husband, that is--

1034
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,040
Whatever happens here, do not talk.

1035
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,480
Hello Karthik!

1036
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:15,760
Indu.

1037
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,600
If your love on me is true...

1038
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,360
...come and take me
at the house of Nellore Obul Reddy.

1039
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,880
Dhanunjay! You coming for
my support along with your ladies...

1040
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,560
...means you feared seeing something.

1041
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,880
What is that?

1042
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,320
Who is that?

1043
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,920
Karthik, son of my long rival.

1044
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,800
has challenged to make me wash his feet
and take my daughter in marriage.

1045
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:45,360
If you put his head at feet,
not just the share in my business...

1046
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,160
...but put all my power, property,
prestige, all at your feet.

1047
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,280
How would he be?

1048
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,440
This is the one.

1049
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,560
Brother! He is the one
who hit to coma brother.

1050
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,640
Come quickly!

1051
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,040
He is the one.

1052
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,080
He is the one.

1053
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,080
No body should ever miss what is in
hands and what comes into the hands.

1054
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,520
Where would he be?
Where?

1055
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:17,040
For him we have left wife, kids, food...

1056
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,720
...and roaming around like mad idiots
day and night.

1057
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,160
Where would he be?

1058
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,960
What is your relation with him?

1059
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:28,520
He is the reason for the marriage of
my sister sitting in marriage.

1060
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,640
He was the one
who hit my brother on the streets...

1061
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,640
...and sending him in to coma and sleep.

1062
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:50,760
For those believing and standing
behind me, I am ready to do anything!

1063
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,120
What exactly happened Obul Reddy?

1064
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,920
When the marriage of my sister
was taking place at the marriage hall.

1065
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,000
Why do you again say love with Karthik?

1066
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,120
It was not Karthik whom I loved.

1067
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,840
I am feeling tensed.

1068
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,280
Do not worry. Kiran is waiting for you
at the petrol bunk.

1069
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,560
If we escape from here, Mumbai flight is
at 7 AM from Vijayawada airport.

1070
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,040
Canada flight is at 11 AM from Mumbai.

1071
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,560
After that no one would know
where you are.

1072
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,120
Do you feel all this happens?

1073
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,400
I have full confidence that
your love would be successful.

1074
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,400
Rest all will be taken care by
the God himself. Let's go.

1075
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,640
Bloody, by seeing your
Facebook and Twitter...

1076
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,360
...I got the doubts cleared that
you have some one for you.

1077
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:52,360
Your marriage here and the death of your
lover there will happen at the same time.

1078
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,720
You will have it after the marriage.

1079
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,920
Whom are you calling,
is it to your husband?

1080
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,520
I will kill you.

1081
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,600
- Hello, small help--
- Wrong number.

1082
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,440
Hello.

1083
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,680
- Hello, my friends are in problems.
- Who is talking?

1084
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,600
- Hello, my friends are in problems.
- Whose number do you want?

1085
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,600
I will call to Rohit.

1086
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,840
Missing? Call the police!

1087
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,280
God, connect at least
this call to those who can save.

1088
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,800
Oh god already battery low.

1089
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:01,760
Yes dad!

1090
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,920
Car tyre is punctured, I am calling you up
as you would be worried.

1091
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,040
Have you heard when I said no for
own driving coming back from the US?

1092
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,160
When driving on own in the long drive
that enjoyment is different dad.

1093
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,360
Whose is this number son?

1094
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,040
Charging in my phone is out dad.

1095
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,000
Thus I am calling from
the phone of mechanic.

1096
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,520
Okay, I will be in front of
you by tomorrow morning.

1097
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,120
Do not tell all this to mom.

1098
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,960
Where is this Mechanic?

1099
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,360
You have got a call man.

1100
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,160
Will come back in five minutes.

1101
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,840
Will get this puncture done
and be back. Stay here.

1102
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,480
Please, please, please, please.

1103
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,160
Who is in what need may be.

1104
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,080
Hello.

1105
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,240
Hello sir, please listen to what I say.

1106
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,160
They are killing two lovers sir.

1107
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,360
I am not understanding
what you are saying.

1108
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,400
You look to have dialled to
a wrong number, please check.

1109
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,280
No. Sir, no.
Now yours is correct number for me...

1110
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,680
...please if you cut the phone
I do not even have the outgoing now.

1111
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,400
Please sir, save the lives of
these two sir, please.

1112
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,520
What happened?

1113
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:56,560
My friend Purvi--

1114
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,160
Where are they now?

1115
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,240
Nellore Lay Palace. Hello.

1116
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,360
Hello. Hello.

1117
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,680
Connection was cut!

1118
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,520
You loved to live with the one you liked
and not to die.

1119
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,400
Your friend has said it all.

1120
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:35,360
Let's go.

1121
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,840
Bring the second bride.

1122
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,080
Groom is not to be seen.

1123
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,440
Hey Bulli Reddy!

1124
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,720
Bring her dragging wherever she is.

1125
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,800
I will bring her here...

1126
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,600
...either dead or alive.

1127
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,960
Hey take out the vehicles.

1128
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:17,920
Move on.

1129
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,320
Come on!

1130
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,880
I understand your problem.

1131
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,400
But understand
the problem of that girl also.

1132
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,120
She is my would be, you come.

1133
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,040
I will die if required
but will not marry him.

1134
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,960
Heard it right, now move on.

1135
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,480
Hey, who are you man?

1136
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,480
Friend, lover or her husband?

1137
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:25,440
Need not be a friend or lover
or a husband to save a girl in danger.

1138
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,320
Man, need to be just a man.

1139
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:33,760
Bloody! Hey, take off the head of
that man and bring her.

1140
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,640
To save those believing me
and standing behind me...

1141
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,920
...I am ready to either lose my head.

1142
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,440
Or to cut as many heads required.

1143
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:43,080
I will not let the one go to any one,
which I cannot get.

1144
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,360
- Take out the vehicles man.
- Stop Obul Reddy!

1145
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,440
For my daughter, he himself would
come here in searching for his death.

1146
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,400
Why have you asked to stop here?

1147
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,040
Will pray to God and come.

1148
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,960
- Hello.
- Hey Karthik!

1149
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,840
I am along with my daughter
in the house of Nellore Obul Reddy.

1150
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:16,800
If you have the capacity come
and take away my daughter, man.

1151
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,440
If you want to see my capacity...

1152
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,880
...first check whether your daughter
is in the room or not, uncle?

1153
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,560
Hey, where is Indu?

1154
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,560
That Karthik has hit all and taken,
brother in law.

1155
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,000
You could have shouted
when he came, right?

1156
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,800
You, yourself has asked not to talk
whatever happens here.

1157
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:43,320
You say what is going to happen
and I say after happening, uncle!

1158
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,120
Hey, hey, hey listen.

1159
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,360
- Hey.
- Sir, who are you?

1160
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,400
Hitting my brother Bulli Reddy
and making him sleep in coma.

1161
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,280
I am the one who would search
wherever you are and kill.

1162
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,840
Oh very good!

1163
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,480
On the whole all my enemies
have assembled at one place.

1164
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,440
All the best man for your thoughts
to search and kill me.

1165
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:03,800
- Hello Purvi!
- Hi Indu.

1166
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,280
I escaped from that Obul Reddy
using Karthik's love for me...

1167
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,560
...the love of that Karthik as
a block in between.

1168
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,520
Very good Indu.

1169
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,240
I received your passport details.
We applied for the visa.

1170
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,760
It would take 10 to 15 days.

1171
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,800
Till then stay some where safe.

1172
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:18,320
Really great that you are loving
the one who saved us so much.

1173
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,480
Okay, first I should escape
from this Karthik.

1174
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,000
I will come back
in touch on phone later.

1175
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,560
You coming with me--

1176
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,480
Not to make your love success.

1177
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,800
To make my love a success.

1178
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,120
I have already loved a guy.

1179
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,880
I do not know how he looks
and where he stays.

1180
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:45,480
You came into my life when I was enquiring
about him and waiting for him.

1181
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,480
When my people feared about you
and put me at Obul Reddy...

1182
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,160
...I used your love to save my love.

1183
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,960
Indu, I do not need to know
whom and why you loved.

1184
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,440
Is truth there in your love?

1185
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,120
How true is love,
it is as much true that I loved.

1186
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,240
I am very sorry Indu.

1187
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,560
Without knowing that
you are in love with someone else...

1188
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,440
...I unnecessarily troubled
you by teasing you.

1189
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,960
I will definitely make your love
a success.

1190
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,720
No Karthik, already you had
many problems dye to me.

1191
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:23,960
Mad lady, even after knowing if you solve
your problems yourself why am I here.

1192
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,320
You are my cousin,
from now your responsibility is mine.

1193
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,400
Go and pray to God.

1194
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,720
Sir, Peddi Reddy is come.

1195
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,360
Salute Peddireddy sir.

1196
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,440
Salute.

1197
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Sir! Start the proceedings...

1198
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,520
...by breaking a coconut.

1199
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,240
Okay, give it.

1200
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,480
Sir, Peddireddy is come.

1201
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,720
Hey, he came!

1202
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,720
His trunk should fall in
between the two villages...

1203
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,680
...his head should hang to my door.

1204
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,040
Chop that bloody rascal.

1205
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,240
"Narasimha! Narasimha!"

1206
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:19,680
"Narasimha! Narasimha!"

1207
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:23,880
"Narasimha! Narasimha!"

1208
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,440
Hey! Don't let Gangi Reddy's men escape!

1209
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,160
Many thanks boy!

1210
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,760
You saved me and my family like
God Lakshmi Narasimha.

1211
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,160
Which village are you from son?

1212
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,280
- We are from Hyderabad sir.
- His name is Karthik...

1213
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,240
...and I am Indu.
We both are lovers uncle.

1214
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:57,720
These two are lovers it seems.

1215
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,760
Yes uncle.

1216
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,400
My father and uncles who do not like
our love are roaming to kill Karthik.

1217
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,920
It would take ten days for us
to get visa to Canada.

1218
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,360
Where to stay till then is--

1219
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,440
Where baby, you are going to stay
at my house, come.

1220
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,520
Not that sir.
You do not say anything son...

1221
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:15,200
...you are the saviour of our lives,
I will safeguard you like my life.

1222
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,640
Come, come behind me.

1223
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,000
You said not to take our men with us
to the temple. Now see what happened.

1224
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,640
Son, you can stay here
till you leave to Canada, stay.

1225
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,120
If someone comes for you,
he will not go out.

1226
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,400
Many thanks sir!

1227
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,920
What is that sir?

1228
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:35,800
A horse.

1229
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,520
I know that sir,
but who is that on the horse?

1230
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,080
- My grand father.
- Where is he sir?

1231
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,240
Up son.

1232
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,280
Up there.

1233
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,360
When all feared to British
and paid the taxes...

1234
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,760
...my grandfather alone did not fear
and not paid tax.

1235
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,400
After independence came,
all the leaders together...

1236
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,840
...gave this as gift as a remembrance
of the power of my grandfather.

1237
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,720
Why have you kept the status there sir?

1238
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,840
What if someone throws it down?

1239
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:57,800
Will I not kill?

1240
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,400
Hey, show the room to
the boy and girl, separate, separate.

1241
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,000
Have you seen
the intelligence in my plan?

1242
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,120
We can stay happily for
these 15 days here. Okay!

1243
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,560
What madam?
Why have you shouted so much?

1244
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,360
Lady, who are those?

1245
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,360
Sons of Big master, sir.

1246
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,480
- Sons!
- Your room is ready sir.

1247
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,680
Okay, we are coming, move.

1248
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,640
You said plan, plan.

1249
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,840
We came to the house of the same,
from whom we had just escaped.

1250
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:25,960
What shall we do now?

1251
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,440
What else, let us run again. Come!

1252
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:49,320
What man? Have you lost shame?
Is the anger dead?

1253
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,440
Till you catch the guy
who hit your brother into coma?

1254
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,600
Have I said you not to step
into this house.

1255
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,680
Father!
Whom you are eagerly waiting to kill...

1256
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,000
...I have brought his photo dad.

1257
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:02,840
Oh God!

1258
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,800
Look dad.

1259
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,520
Hey, why will I see the photo of enemy?

1260
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,520
Thank God!

1261
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:23,880
What I want is not his photo ID,
body of his with life. Go.

1262
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,480
What?

1263
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,480
It is been many days since they had
the home food uncle, that is why--

1264
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,200
You know it, right? You on this side of
wall and they on that side!

1265
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,760
It is up to you whether you feed
them or kiss them. Go, die.

1266
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:33,880
Come!

1267
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,560
I will prepared biryani for you hubby.

1268
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,680
How many more days is
this distance between us hubby!

1269
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:45,200
Bloody! The one who made me
lose the family with wife...

1270
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,040
...and affection with children at home...

1271
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:51,400
...I will keep chopping
till the sharpness is gone to my axe.

1272
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,560
What is that fight outside sir?

1273
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,720
That is the fight of my family, son.

1274
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,520
My whole family is been waiting to kill
the one who hit my son into coma.

1275
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,920
Okay! Why us among
your family fights sir?

1276
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:00,640
We would leave now.

1277
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,760
Where going? What is the relation
to you with the fights of my family?

1278
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,400
You, the savior of my life...

1279
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,440
...should stay in my house till
you leave to Canada and that is it!

1280
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,120
It is not correct to stay here
in this situation, Karthik.

1281
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,080
It is correct for us
to stay here only Indu.

1282
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:13,960
Why?

1283
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,160
You think one thing.

1284
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,920
These three brothers would be
moving around the world for us...

1285
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,000
...but will not come into this house.

1286
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,480
So, it is safe for us to stay here
inside the house.

1287
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,960
Does these do not know
who he is or is this all a drama? Huh!

1288
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,360
Where is my Dhoni photo?

1289
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,640
You tore my photo of Sachin
and thus I tore your photo of Dhoni.

1290
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,680
Okay, we so came
and fell in this house...

1291
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,040
...that is the matter man!

1292
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,560
What is it man? If Indu has loved someone,
you help her?

1293
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,280
Have you forgotten
about the wish of mom?

1294
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,520
The loyalty in her love
was seen in her eyes man!

1295
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,520
If mom listens to my decision,
she too would say correct.

1296
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,760
Mother in law!

1297
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:07,600
Oh God! Kalyani!
Open the door Kalyani.

1298
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:11,600
- Open the door Kalyani.
- Open the door.

1299
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,360
- What is happened?
- Kalyani is hanging herself.

1300
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,920
What baby,
have done such a big deed?

1301
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,640
Look at mother in law,
how much she is suffering.

1302
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,960
When there are so many own people...

1303
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,080
...what was the need for you
to commit suicide?

1304
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:31,480
Marriage of my daughter had stopped
on the marriage occasion itself, son!

1305
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,120
It was none other who tried to
kill my husband at the temple....

1306
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,520
...he is my own brother.

1307
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,680
25 years back...

1308
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:46,440
...my brother Gangi Reddy and my husband
Peddi Reddy were good friends.

1309
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,840
Both the families to turn
the friendship into relation...

1310
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,280
...have performed internal
exchange marriages...

1311
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,240
...from the villagers saying
to construct a factory.

1312
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,520
After some days, my husband and
brother have taken thousand acres.

1313
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,600
Later started fights among these two
and both our families got separated.

1314
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:06,120
And one day our lawyer had called us.

1315
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:10,320
Give our lands back!
Give our lands back!

1316
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,840
The case of 1000 acres put by the public
on you is gone to high court.

1317
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,120
We can manage till court...

1318
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17,120
...but none can do anything
if the matter goes to the hands of CBI.

1319
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,840
What do we do now Viswam?

1320
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,520
You both became week in public by
separating and thus they became strong.

1321
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,440
If you need to become stronger
than them...

1322
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,760
...you two staying as rivals
now should turn into relatives again.

1323
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,040
That cannot be done,
tell if there is something else.

1324
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,360
Sir, I said what needs to be said.

1325
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,000
It is your wish now whether to share
the land becoming relatives...

1326
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,040
...or count the bars staying as rivals.

1327
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,360
We shall do as said by you, okay!

1328
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,480
Both the families would become one again
with these two marriages...

1329
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,120
...and we shall step
in at our maternal homes.

1330
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,400
Me and my sister in law have felt
very happy thinking that.

1331
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,960
In such moment...

1332
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,760
...someone had taken daughter of
my brother from the marriage.

1333
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:05,600
Now as another match is seen
for the son of my brother...

1334
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,640
...my daughter is done
this suicide attempt.

1335
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,480
For my husband and sons...

1336
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,760
...only interest is the revenge to kill
the one, who is hit sending into coma.

1337
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,360
But, no interest about
the marriage of my daughter.

1338
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,400
Though it is so many days,
there is no man in this house...

1339
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,800
...who understands our pain son!

1340
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,600
It is an order from my father in law...

1341
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,680
...that no good occasion should
take place in this house till...

1342
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,000
...that guy hitting is caught.

1343
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,360
Look! Due to whomever
your marriage has stopped...

1344
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,160
...as a brother I will leave this house
only after your marriage.

1345
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:45,520
So, for the good occasion
to take place in this house...

1346
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,240
...the one who hit into coma
should be caught!

1347
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:50,880
He will be caught.

1348
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:51,960
How?

1349
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,280
A lie? Father will kill, if he knows.

1350
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,160
One marriage takes place
by saying thousand lies.

1351
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,280
Your sister would be married by
saying just this one lie.

1352
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,760
You too can come inside the house.

1353
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,480
Dad! We brought the person
who bashed our brother!

1354
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,000
- Come out!
- Come out!

1355
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:11,960
Where is he?
Where is the person who did that?

1356
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,440
Hey! Get him down.

1357
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,960
Is he the one?

1358
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,920
Even I don't know that
people end up in coma...

1359
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,120
...if I bash them up
till these guys told me.

1360
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,440
If he is in coma, then definitely
I am the one who bashed him up.

1361
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,160
He is so short...

1362
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,840
...how can he bash
up your strong brother?

1363
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,640
Hey! Hey!

1364
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:40,480
I your son is like a lion,
I am like a mountain!

1365
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:43,400
I will cut heads off!

1366
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,920
Obul Reddy, is he the one that beat him?

1367
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,200
Or did you make a plan
to enter this house...

1368
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:53,240
...and got this foolish man?

1369
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:56,680
No.. we swear by you. He is the one!

1370
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:59,400
Hey! You swore by me!

1371
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,120
If I learn that he isn't the one,
I won't think twice...

1372
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,360
...and kill all of you.. I swear by you!

1373
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,600
Karthik!

1374
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,600
Why is he here?

1375
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,840
We can't tell him he's the one.

1376
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:14,560
What's it, uncle?

1377
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:17,360
I found the person that beat my son..

1378
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,360
Great!

1379
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,800
These?! What are these doing here?

1380
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,280
These are my sons..
you know them earlier?

1381
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,720
Your sons?
These are the ones trying to kill me!

1382
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,440
Why do you want to kill Karthik?

1383
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,360
- Tell me what the matter is!
- It is--

1384
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,200
Tell the truth!

1385
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,080
You will say it or want me to do it?

1386
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,160
I will say it!

1387
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,640
Uncle.. Indu's father
paid them to kill me.

1388
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,200
They have been trying
to kill me since then.

1389
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,280
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

1390
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:44,560
Fools, who do you think Karthik is?

1391
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,720
He is the one who
saved your father's life.

1392
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:49,680
- Salute him.
- It's okay.

1393
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,680
Stop your crap and
tell me what role to play.

1394
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,240
I get irritated if it gets late.

1395
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:58,080
I'll give the climax for your character.

1396
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,240
Cut this idiot to pieces!

1397
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,600
Why would you do that?

1398
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,840
- Let's do it.
- Why do you turn that side?

1399
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,960
Hey!

1400
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
- Wait!
- What is it, boy?

1401
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,200
Uncle, only the sleeping Bulli
Reddy who should come and kill him.

1402
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:17,360
Is he just asleep to do that?
He's in coma.

1403
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:20,160
We'll make him stay here
till Bulli Reddy wakes up.

1404
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:24,000
How can we do that?
I can't stand his sight!

1405
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,960
You are a mad man anyway!

1406
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,560
It isn't important that we kill him.

1407
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,200
The important thing is
that Bulli Reddy kills him!

1408
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,000
Great, Karthik. That is manliness!

1409
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,080
He tricked us!

1410
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:37,960
Feed him thick and fat!

1411
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,040
His neck should be
very strong when we cut it!

1412
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,840
- Take him inside.
- Wait!

1413
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,080
Did I say I won't come?

1414
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,600
You are making me a
pawn and playing around!

1415
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,040
We found the person who beat your son.
Now ask them to come inside.

1416
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,520
Come in!

1417
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:05,800
Karthik!

1418
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,840
You have no relation with this family..
yet trying to get this marriage done.

1419
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,360
Great, Karthik.

1420
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:16,080
To do some things,
you need emotion and not relations.

1421
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:24,080
Thanks.. if you didn't
help me that minute...

1422
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,600
...I would have been dead by now.

1423
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,040
- Who are you?
- My name is Raju.

1424
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,880
- I work in the court.
- A lawyer?

1425
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,520
No.. A liar.. Telling lies is my hobby.

1426
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,760
I did that and got
10 innocent people in jail.

1427
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,240
Are you the one to beat Bulli Reddy?

1428
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:39,120
I can't even beat kids..
how can I send anyone into coma?

1429
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,880
Why did you say so then? Are you mad?

1430
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:44,160
It is Peddi Reddy that is mad..
their sons told me.

1431
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,600
They promised to pay a lakh
per day if I did as they say.

1432
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,960
I asked for 5 lakhs hoping
it may settle at 3 lakhs.

1433
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,400
The fools agreed for 5 lakhs.

1434
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,840
They are mad too.. and so they agreed.

1435
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,400
- What do you mean?
- Yes.. even those 3 are mad.

1436
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,000
Really? How do you know?

1437
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,520
Only a doctor knows his patients.

1438
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,680
- Patients?!
- I am Karthik.. psychiatrist.

1439
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:06,000
A psychiatrist! You look like an artist.

1440
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,160
I don't understand
what's happening here.

1441
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:11,120
If you want to know that,
I've to tell you a story.

1442
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:11,960
What's it?

1443
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,080
Fifteen years ago..
that was marriage season.

1444
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:18,000
- Month of may?
- Yes, correct.

1445
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:22,920
Peddi Reddy started off in his vehicle to
perform child marriage for his daughter.

1446
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:27,480
On the same road, a young boy was
riding a cycle in opposite direction.

1447
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:31,320
Thinking the car would
be damaged if the cycle hit it...

1448
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,080
...he turned the car to one side.

1449
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:37,320
He hit another car coming in opposite
direction.. a terrible accident happened.

1450
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:39,960
Was he afraid that car
would be damaged if cycle hit it?

1451
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,280
Who is that mad driver?

1452
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,320
- It is Peddi Reddy--
- Is it him?

1453
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,960
He suffered a head
injury and turned insane...

1454
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,680
...his son Bulli Reddy went
into a coma and the marriage cancelled.

1455
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,120
Just like some diseases
run in the family...

1456
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,120
...Peddi Reddy's madness
spread in the family.

1457
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,560
It is not yet over.. I didn't
tell you the main twist in the story.

1458
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,200
- What is it?
- I was the one riding that cycle.

1459
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,600
- Doctor!
- Yes, Mr. Raju!

1460
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:05,200
I felt bad that this
family suffered due to me...

1461
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:08,280
...and studied hard
to become a psychiatrist.

1462
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,880
To remove the madness
that this family contracted...

1463
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,200
...and to get the marriage
of his elder daughter performed...

1464
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:16,200
...I came to this house.

1465
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,880
You were responsible for this accident,
but dragged me in!

1466
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,440
- I am going home.
- You'll die if you move.

1467
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,200
Why?

1468
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:24,520
These mad people think that
you beat Bulli Reddy into coma.

1469
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,040
Do you think that I am a fool?

1470
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,280
I'll tell them that Bulli
Reddy went into coma because of you.

1471
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,800
- Tell them.
- I will!

1472
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,000
I'll go and tell!

1473
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,960
Go and tell them!

1474
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:38,160
Boys! I know who's responsible
for Bulli Reddy going into coma.

1475
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,560
- Who is it?
- Karthik.

1476
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,680
Who told you?

1477
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:47,600
Do you think I am mad like you guys
to believe every Tom, Dick and Harry?

1478
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:49,880
Karthik himself told me..
What's your reaction now?

1479
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,560
You beat my brother and blame others!

1480
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,920
When did I beat him..
this is just a 5 lakh deal!

1481
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,160
What deal? Are you insane?

1482
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:00,040
If you say the same to someone else--

1483
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,920
You guys are mad.

1484
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:03,320
How dare you call us mad?

1485
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,560
You are mad too!

1486
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,720
- You call my brother mad?
- Hold on!

1487
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:13,400
I have clarity after these slaps.

1488
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,600
All three of you are mad.

1489
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:20,080
Doctor, they are indeed mad as you said.

1490
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,640
I just learns that madness to
can be in family like sugar complaint.

1491
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:26,040
You are right, sir. Normal people
take it easy if they are called mad...

1492
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,280
...but mad people become
wild if they are called mad.

1493
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,640
Yes, doctor.. they bashed me up!

1494
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:31,920
What's the solution for this?

1495
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,560
We have two options basically.

1496
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,560
Option A..
to get Peddi Reddy's daughter married.

1497
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,920
- Option B?
- If we can take the madness to a peak...

1498
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,040
...a burst the blood
vessels that got blocked...

1499
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,640
...and they become normal as a result,
you can get out.

1500
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,120
You take care of the marriage...

1501
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:48,040
...I will make their
madness reach a peak.

1502
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,640
- Very good, sir.
- Thank you, doctor.

1503
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:51,960
Gangi Reddy attacked me.

1504
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,120
We shouldn't let him escape.

1505
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:56,160
It is just crap that
they won't let him escape.

1506
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,000
I beat the son into coma,
and they couldn't do anything to me!

1507
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:01,320
He is fat, wears rings and wrist bands...

1508
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,480
...and golden chains
and terrible to look at!

1509
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,160
He's useless..
and he has four ox-like sons.

1510
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,360
What's the use? They just fill
their stomachs and are good for nothing!

1511
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,320
And it seems they all are mad!
Mad fellows!

1512
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,480
Hey.. why do you stare like
crows suffering current shock?

1513
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,600
- Hey!
- Hey!

1514
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,080
Don't stop them! I want peaks!

1515
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,160
Mental peaks! Freaks, come on!

1516
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,600
I can get out only if you madness peaks!

1517
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:27,720
Take swords or hammers as you wish.

1518
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,200
Or you may choose to
be trendy and take up guns.

1519
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,720
C'mon.. round up! Round up!

1520
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,200
I just said that in the flow..
you thought it true?

1521
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,920
You may have done that..
but we come on a serious matter.

1522
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,840
- Who is Peddi Reddy here?
- Don't know.

1523
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,040
- What?
- It is that huge man over there.

1524
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,680
Go and catch him!

1525
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,440
- Who are you?
- I am from CBI!

1526
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:50,800
What?!

1527
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:55,640
We can manage the local courts
but not once it goes to CBI.

1528
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:59,000
The court got angry that
you usurped people's lands...

1529
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,200
...the case came to me and I came here.

1530
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:02,680
I'm arresting you all.. come to Delhi!

1531
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:03,960
Why directly to Delhi?

1532
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,360
Because the Tihar jail is there.

1533
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,320
- Bring them all along.
- Come on, move!

1534
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,720
- Move!
- Uncle!

1535
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,280
Nephew, what are you doing here?

1536
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,880
What's this uncle?
Won't you spare anyone who is rich?

1537
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,280
Won't you rest till you
send a rich people to jail?

1538
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,520
Once I take up a case,
they all will go to jail.

1539
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:24,160
First I'll throw Peddi Reddy
and Gangi Reddy into prison...

1540
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,000
- ...you know about me!
- I do!

1541
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:28,680
Peddi Reddy isn't such a man..
He looks huge...

1542
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,120
...but has a soft heart.

1543
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,080
See his cute face if you want.

1544
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,320
I can see the innocence in his face...

1545
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,640
- But I won't spare. Bring him.
- Please give me a week's time.

1546
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:41,480
I'll prove that it is all Gangi
Reddy's fault and not Peddi Reddy's!

1547
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,360
I won't listen even to god..
bring him along.

1548
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,000
You'll listen to me, uncle.

1549
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,280
Because you love me a lot!

1550
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:50,080
That relationship! Okay!

1551
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:52,680
You touched me..
I'll give a week's time.

1552
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:55,720
If you try any mischief,
I'll crush them all like eggs!

1553
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,760
- Officers, follow me!
- Yes, sir.

1554
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:00,800
- Thanks, my boy.
- We shouldn't be thanking now.

1555
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:02,800
We need an intelligent lawyer!

1556
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:06,400
I told you that day in detail.

1557
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,360
I can't do anything
once CBI gets involved.

1558
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:09,840
- Only you can do, sir.
- How?

1559
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:13,400
We'll get our daughter
married to Gangi Reddy's son.

1560
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,880
We'll promise to give a
thousand acres of land as dowry.

1561
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,280
And we'll transfer the
land in the name of Gangi Reddy.

1562
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,240
Since the land will be in his name...

1563
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:23,360
...CBI people will arrest
only Gangi Reddy! What do you say?

1564
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,200
Who are you teaching a criminal lawyer?

1565
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,200
He's our boy..
but I can't agree to this match.

1566
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:30,920
Listen to me.. only in this
way will our girl's marriage be done...

1567
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,800
...and our revenge
on Gangi Reddy achieved.

1568
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:35,000
That's fine.. but will he agree to this?

1569
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,920
- Our lawyer is there for that!
- Me?!

1570
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,800
Karthik..
will Gangi Reddy believe the lawyer...

1571
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,320
...and come to our house?

1572
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,600
Even the mighty God came
as Vamana for 3 feet of land.

1573
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:49,680
And this is thousand acres..
he will come shaking his head like a bull.

1574
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,880
As I said.. here he comes.

1575
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,480
Bro-in-law..
I didn't come here to fight.

1576
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,480
I came to settle a match..
shall I enter or not?

1577
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:11,800
Why do you just stand
there and talk? Come in!

1578
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,400
What are you doing? He's our enemy.

1579
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:19,200
No.. he's my bro-in-law!
My sister's husband.

1580
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,360
I will give my daughter
in marriage to their son.

1581
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,240
Stay if you wish.. or get lost!

1582
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:25,960
- How are you all?
- Forgive me!

1583
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,280
You must forgive me.

1584
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:29,040
We'll complete the marriage.

1585
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,120
Good.

1586
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:40,200
Doctor, what's all this?

1587
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,320
They have come to settle a marriage.

1588
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,040
Marriage? But they are mad people!

1589
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,080
The other family is mad too..
I told you a story the other day.

1590
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:48,440
Is that a normal story to forget it?

1591
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,960
Yes, in that story,
Peddi Reddy's car rammed into..

1592
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,640
Wait.. it hit them.

1593
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:57,520
With that they all lost their
brains and became mad families.

1594
01:33:57,560 --> 01:33:59,840
Because you were the
one that rode the bicycle...

1595
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,320
...you have to settle their marriage.

1596
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,640
Raj sir.. your brain is so sharp!

1597
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,680
You got the entire story in your grip!

1598
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:08,040
If you give a hint, I can guess it all..
They are mad people...

1599
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,280
...they are no challenge to me.

1600
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:13,520
Karthik..
he is someone who is close to us.

1601
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:16,640
He told me that relationships
are more important than wealth.

1602
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,320
He's the one who changed me.

1603
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,000
A single person like
you in a family is enough.

1604
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:25,000
Is it a problem to have two?
Why resort to useless sentiments?

1605
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,000
- Mr. Raj.
- Wait, doctor.

1606
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,920
My life is like a man
caught by a toothless tiger.

1607
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,040
It won't eat him or let him go.

1608
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,280
Why are you torturing me like this?
Do something!

1609
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:34,600
- Mr. Raj!
- Please wait, sir.

1610
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:37,000
He's like a baboon.. who is he?

1611
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,480
He's the one who beat
Bulli Reddy into a coma!

1612
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,160
So.. he's the one who took my daughter.

1613
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,520
What daughter is he talking about?

1614
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,120
Oh!

1615
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:50,000
Yes! I am the one who
took your daughter away.

1616
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:52,120
Tell me if you have another daughter..
I'll take her away too.

1617
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,360
- Come on!
- Hey!

1618
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:56,440
Wait.. he shall be
killed only by Bulli Reddy!

1619
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,040
Your understanding is great!

1620
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,320
You raise your voices
equally in support!

1621
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,840
And you keep referring to Bulli Reddy..
what's all this?

1622
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:03,520
- You don't have any clarity?
- Hey!

1623
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,640
- Take his away from here.
- No need! I'll leave on my own.

1624
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:07,600
Why do you just stand here, uncle?
Take the guests inside.

1625
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,800
Go and make the necessary arrangements.
Come, bro-in-law!

1626
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:11,400
Come, sis-in-law!

1627
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,360
Karthik..
I need to speak to you urgently.

1628
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:23,680
- Tell me.
- Karthik!

1629
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:26,360
The person that I love.. he has come.

1630
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,960
Is that so? Very good! Where is he?

1631
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,440
Vamsee!

1632
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:33,760
Karthik.. Vamsee!

1633
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:34,720
- He is Karthik.
- Hi!

1634
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:35,920
Glad to meet you.

1635
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:39,800
You are very lucky.
I know how much Indu loves you.

1636
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:43,280
Karthik.. we must introduce
him to all as your friend.

1637
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:47,000
Peddi Reddy and his son's shouldn't
know the truth about Vamsee.

1638
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,720
If they do, his life will be in danger.

1639
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:50,160
- Why?
- Because--

1640
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:53,360
Vamsee is the one who
beat Bulli Reddy into coma!

1641
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:57,040
Sorry that I kept this
secret from you all this while.

1642
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:00,640
When Bulli Reddy was about
to kill my friend and her lover...

1643
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:04,560
...I didn't know whom
to call and dialled a number...

1644
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,160
..it got connected to Vamsee.

1645
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:10,240
Please listen to me..
here two lovers are being killed.

1646
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,040
Please don't cut the phone..
or they'll be dead.

1647
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:19,360
He saved two lives just
answering a phone call.

1648
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,960
Who can be a greater man than him?

1649
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:25,040
That's why I love Vamsee so much!

1650
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,520
I believe you more
than others in this house.

1651
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:32,280
Because you are setting right
the mistake that was caused by us.

1652
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,880
You have to ensure
the success of our love.

1653
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,640
Your love is true, Indu.

1654
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:43,840
I will make the truth in it win.

1655
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,960
How is my twist?

1656
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,040
When I inquired about
my daughter's lover...

1657
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:05,040
...I learnt through
a Canada friend it is you.

1658
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,000
I locked her up and through her...

1659
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:10,240
...made Naidu's son enter your character.

1660
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:13,400
We made her believe that
it is Vamsee that Indu loves.

1661
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:16,520
You make us get a dummy
for the one who beat my brother...

1662
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,080
...got close to our father...

1663
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,760
...and plan to get my sister
married to our enemy's son!

1664
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,720
That's why we framed you up.
After my daughter leaves with Vamsee...

1665
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:27,560
...and after Peddi Reddy
learns the truth about you--

1666
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,080
Your death at the hands of our father!

1667
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:33,560
Hey 6 idiots!

1668
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:38,520
I left it since Indu said
she was in love with someone.

1669
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,000
But now that I learnt
that it is I that she loves...

1670
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:43,600
...how did you assume that
I will take it lying down?

1671
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,200
So, will you reveal
that you beat Bulli Reddy?

1672
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,120
You may do that,
but Indu won't believe you.

1673
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:52,360
Crap.. why would Indu
love me for saving someone?

1674
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:55,800
You got this dummy in
the place of my character.

1675
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:59,520
I'll make Indu reject
him and love me as myself.

1676
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:04,200
I will marry your daughter at the same
moment the other marriage happens here.

1677
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:07,840
Ah! When we the guy
she loves is with him...

1678
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:11,720
...you will make her change
her mind in four days and marry her?

1679
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:12,800
You think it would happen?

1680
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,560
It will happen for sure.

1681
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:19,840
I too just understood that
the goddess' wish is very strong.

1682
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:23,240
I will show you another
angle of mine from today.

1683
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:24,760
Crap!

1684
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:32,560
- Mr. Raj.. it means--
- Tell me!

1685
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:36,840
Tell me that they are mad too.. You said
you are a psychiatrist and rode a cycle...

1686
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:39,200
...you deceived me
with all such nonsense.

1687
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:42,320
Hey.. I'll tell all your
stories to Peddi Reddy just now.

1688
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:45,680
Go and tell him..
if one wants to die, who can stop him?

1689
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:46,760
Who wants to die?

1690
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,400
Peddi Reddy kills his
own sons if they lie to him.

1691
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,600
Now recall the overacting that you did.

1692
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:54,440
Hey! Hey!

1693
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:58,120
If your son is a lion,
I am like the mountain!

1694
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,800
I will cut all to pieces...

1695
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,120
...I swear by my mother!

1696
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,160
I feel like crying.

1697
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:07,320
Raju sir..
anyone can smile if he wishes to.

1698
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,480
But the one who smiles when
he feels like crying.. he's a man.

1699
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,080
What can I smile for..
what's my situation?

1700
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:15,600
Simple.. just wake Bulli Reddy
from his coma.. your work will be done.

1701
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:17,120
Just try that!

1702
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,240
I'll wake him!

1703
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:23,800
I'll do that which no doctor,
hospital or medicine achieved.

1704
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:29,200
"The beauty of dance is enthralling."

1705
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:34,040
"The art of dance leads
one to the path of knowledge."

1706
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:38,320
"The emotion and the moves."

1707
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,080
"Dance!"

1708
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:48,840
"Mood."

1709
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:58,440
"The beauty of dance is enthralling."

1710
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:04,080
Let's go to your father--

1711
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:05,840
Brothers!

1712
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:11,320
See how I managed to
wake him from coma.

1713
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,240
We'll make him tell
the truth to your father.

1714
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,440
And let's finish off Karthik together.

1715
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:20,840
If he wakes up, you'll go.

1716
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,360
Into coma!

1717
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:38,600
"There is no breath without you."

1718
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:41,960
"There is no life without you."

1719
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,240
"There is no breath without you."

1720
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:48,640
"There is no life without you."

1721
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:06,440
"Wherever I see and whatever I do."

1722
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:09,040
"You are always before my eyes."

1723
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:13,440
"There is some un-describable feeling..."

1724
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:15,720
"...that has woken up in my heart."

1725
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:19,080
"I didn't do anything..
it is the wish of your heart."

1726
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:22,400
"That is talking to you."

1727
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:25,600
"I am not a special one."

1728
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:31,920
"I can't express it
and I can't let it go."

1729
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:35,080
"Admit that it is love."

1730
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:40,320
"If you say,
I will spin the earth around."

1731
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:43,720
"There is no breath without you."

1732
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:47,120
"There is no life without you."

1733
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:50,360
"There is no breath without you."

1734
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:53,880
"There is no life without you."

1735
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:11,800
"Wherever I see and whatever I do."

1736
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,640
"You are always before me."

1737
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,320
"A place without you
is filled with darkness."

1738
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:53,600
"Dawn comes soon as I see you."

1739
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:56,720
"Why does time pass very slowly."

1740
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,480
"It is all beyond my comprehension."

1741
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:05,960
"Her eyes say that she'll
behold none other than me."

1742
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:12,200
"She held me in her
gaze and closed her eyelids."

1743
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:17,000
"I can't express it..."

1744
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,360
"...and I can't let it go."

1745
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:23,440
"Admit that it is love."

1746
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:28,760
"If you say,
I will stop air from moving."

1747
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,000
"There is no breath without you."

1748
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:35,360
"There is no life without you."

1749
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:38,680
"There is no breath without you."

1750
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:42,880
"There is no life without you."

1751
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:45,440
Okay dad, bye dad.

1752
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:47,040
- Hello, I am Raju.
- Take care.

1753
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:47,840
Hi.

1754
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:49,680
I am the first dummy come into
the place of that Karthik fellow...

1755
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:50,720
...you are the second dummy.

1756
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:52,280
We both are dummies.

1757
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:55,800
If you follow my direction,
we can fool that Karthik...

1758
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:57,200
...you can gain your love...

1759
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,200
- Come on follow me.
- Okay.

1760
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,120
Follow me friend.

1761
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:06,920
What are these two doing?

1762
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,080
Hey stop!

1763
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:24,280
What man,
why are feeling so much of shy?

1764
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,520
It is a matter not to be said
before Vamsi...

1765
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:28,120
...if you want I will tell later.
Push off!

1766
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,440
Hey, what has happened?

1767
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:30,520
Need to tell right now, right now.

1768
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:32,680
- Okay, I will tell!
- Yes tell.

1769
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:35,920
I went into the room of
Indu for her.

1770
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:36,960
Okay, after you went.

1771
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:43,120
When I was seeing here
and there for Indu.

1772
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:50,320
Indu came from behind
and hugged me tight.

1773
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:57,680
I, mesmerized in that hug,
suddenly turned back.

1774
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,480
Then Indu looking at me in shame.

1775
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:02,880
Sorry Karthik, thought it was Vamsi.

1776
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:04,480
It is okay Indu.

1777
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:06,840
Whoever may be the person,
but your feeling is the same, right?

1778
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:08,600
Go Karthik

1779
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:14,240
Thanks Vamsi! It was because of you,
from Indu--

1780
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:19,760
Oh crap! What is this Indu
hugging this guy Raju sir?

1781
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:21,560
I understood one thing.

1782
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:25,760
Indu is mad in love with you,
I will tell you a plan.

1783
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:29,520
Hi.

1784
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:31,240
Leave Vamsi.

1785
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:34,640
I know Indu,
what you are waiting for, come on.

1786
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:38,120
What is wrong with you?

1787
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:40,080
Is this the way to behave
with the girl you love.

1788
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:41,280
I didn't expect this from you.

1789
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:42,640
What happened Indu?

1790
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:43,560
We both are lovers, right?

1791
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:44,680
Just get out!

1792
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:45,520
Not that Indu--

1793
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:47,800
What happened?
What was that sound here?

1794
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,560
Please take Vamsi outside Karthik!

1795
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,080
Hey, what happened?

1796
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:53,360
Me, Please ask him to go out Karthik!

1797
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:54,800
Indu actually--

1798
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:56,240
I know well about Indu...

1799
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:58,160
nothing like actually
or other bro, come!

1800
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:00,640
I will set it right man.
You go, I will solve this problem.

1801
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,160
What happened Indu?

1802
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,000
Karthik! That fellow hugged me.

1803
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:08,040
Loved him truly without knowing about him,
just by seeing his helping nature.

1804
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:10,120
But, have you seen what he is done?

1805
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,920
Are the girls in love so cheap
to the boys, Karthik?

1806
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,320
Wrong Indu.

1807
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:15,760
Boys if connect once
would keep their loved girls...

1808
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,520
...in heart and take care about them.

1809
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:19,680
As Vamsi has come from the US...

1810
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:21,360
...maybe he is not accustomed
to this culture yet.

1811
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:23,840
I will talk to him,
you please be relaxed.

1812
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,160
What man, Vamsi?

1813
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,600
Your first impression at Indu
itself is become so worst man.

1814
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,840
Firstly without knowing
whether what I said was true or not...

1815
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:34,480
...why have you hurried up
by listening to the words of this fellow?

1816
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:36,000
What Raju fellow?
What fellow?

1817
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:36,800
Hey idiot!

1818
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:39,960
Advices need to be given by
the ones with brains, not a fool like you.

1819
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:41,440
See you then!

1820
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:42,520
Fool?

1821
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,080
Come here, I have a doubt...

1822
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:50,000
...there was a huge sound from inside.
Did she hit so hard?

1823
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,520
She hit like this, you bloody!

1824
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:57,080
Wish of my wife is that...

1825
01:46:57,120 --> 01:47:01,760
...both the families along with the to be
wedded new couple and have food.

1826
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,000
Hi everybody!

1827
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:15,880
What brother in law?

1828
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:17,680
Arrangements for the marriage
are all in track, right?

1829
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,880
Oh that! I understood brother in law,
delay is yours now.

1830
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:23,040
What Prabhakar?
Are the documents made ready?

1831
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:25,120
They would be ready
in the next two days brother on law.

1832
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:26,640
What happened brother in law?

1833
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:28,400
You must chew it
and not swallow directly.

1834
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:29,680
Give that water.

1835
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:31,240
Sir, start over action.

1836
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:36,920
What happened brother in law,
what happened?

1837
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:39,200
What is this? What happened?

1838
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:40,760
- Sis in law, give the water.
- Is it all!

1839
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,360
Looks like some chest pain.

1840
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:43,400
Sir, let us make
a call to the big Doctor you know.

1841
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,600
Doctor, medicines, will call, will call.

1842
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,360
What is this drama, boy?
What if that guy dies?

1843
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:51,000
Sir, Gangi Reddy should not die
ordinarily getting a heart attack.

1844
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:53,160
If at all the attack comes,
it should be from you.

1845
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:55,640
Only then would
the revenge of your range is done.

1846
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:58,400
Correct boy! If at all he dies,
should die because of me.

1847
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:01,560
What is that sir? Wipe off that sweat,
I will be back right away.

1848
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,800
hey, what is this burning sensation?

1849
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:10,680
Elder man, that man has asked
to give these tablets.

1850
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:13,160
Nothing son!
He has a gastric problem.

1851
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:14,680
Brother was worried a bit more.

1852
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:17,320
Was it normal worry?
Though man looks strong...

1853
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:18,840
...he from inside is crying like
an LKG boy...

1854
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,640
...thinking what is happened
to his brother in law.

1855
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:24,040
It is only that you have been
separated from so many years...

1856
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,040
...but your relation is no way cut sir.

1857
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:37,200
You are feeling so much about me, who had
wished for your death brother in law!

1858
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:43,560
Time is 11 and all are in deep sleep.

1859
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,720
Now I shall wake up that coma guy
and take him to Peddi Reddy.

1860
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:52,840
Hey boy, Bulli Reddy boy, get up man!

1861
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:55,400
I know how to wake you up!

1862
01:48:58,640 --> 01:48:59,840
Here, drink, drink man.

1863
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:07,200
Yes, I know man that you get up
if this drink is given to you.

1864
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:09,720
This simple treatment is not known
even to Doctors. You bloody!

1865
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,480
Doctor?

1866
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:14,280
Yes, I am Doctor Psychiortist,
take this.

1867
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:17,760
Hey, I have been waking you up
with so much hard work...

1868
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:19,480
...and you bros and sis in laws
are coming...

1869
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,280
...and sending you back into coma.

1870
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:22,040
Yes Doctor.

1871
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:25,040
I will take you to your father
in the right route map, come.

1872
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:28,200
Okay, but what if someone identifies
in the middle of the route?

1873
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:29,240
I will act like have gone back
into coma.

1874
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:30,960
Great, very good!

1875
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,160
Hey though in coma you are
in great sync man! Come on follow me.

1876
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:39,680
Oh God!
This short fellow is doing as said.

1877
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:42,280
If these go to Peddi Reddy,
everything will be ruptured and ruined.

1878
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,000
I should somehow stop them.

1879
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:46,360
What is this Gangi Reddy sir?

1880
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:47,760
Anybody would drink this on
an occasion...

1881
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:49,440
...why are you taking when in frustration?

1882
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:50,680
Because of that short guy!

1883
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,920
Short means is it our Raju sir?

1884
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,920
Yes the same guy!

1885
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:55,720
Not just eloping my daughter...

1886
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:59,080
...he is said to elope even
another daughter, if at all I have.

1887
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:00,440
That is why I drank.
I would someday kill that fellow.

1888
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,880
Why someday sir?
Do it this day itself, I will take care.

1889
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:04,200
What, when all are in the house?

1890
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:05,360
All in the house have slept...

1891
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:07,760
...and that short fellow is
still moving outside sir. There.

1892
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:12,240
There is the knife
and there is the body. Kill him sir.

1893
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:14,040
You are caught, man!

1894
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:20,280
Hey Prabhakar!
Tonight I am killing that short idiot.

1895
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:23,280
I will be presenting his dead body
to my bro in law as a gift.

1896
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:29,360
Your uncle is coming,
he would kill me.

1897
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:30,080
What my uncle?

1898
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:32,160
Do you need details now?
You go and be in coma.

1899
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:33,240
I would go and hide in some room.

1900
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:55,120
What is your plan man?

1901
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:56,880
We are kidnapping Indu.

1902
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:58,680
What? Shall I kidnap my own daughter?

1903
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:01,640
Indu even before she falls in love
with Karthik.

1904
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,240
If we have to escape
from this house this is correct.

1905
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:04,960
Is it.

1906
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,640
Vamsi are waiting outside
with the vehicle.

1907
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,840
Chloroform in my hand is also waiting.

1908
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:11,920
Oh my uncles.

1909
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:28,480
Hey brother,
we shall kidnap Indu from here tonight.

1910
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:30,320
We shall kill Karthik
if comes in our way.

1911
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:35,360
Hey! As long as I am alive, will not
let injustice happen to Karthik...

1912
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:37,120
...you bloody idiots.

1913
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:44,840
Daddy, daddy.

1914
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:49,920
Hey, why is father knocking the doors?

1915
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:53,160
Oh god brothers are coming.

1916
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:58,280
Why is Bulli Reddy here?

1917
01:51:58,560 --> 01:51:59,880
Where is father?

1918
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:01,160
Who knocked the doors then?

1919
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:03,720
Something is happening.
Let us first take him into the room

1920
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:08,360
Oh God, he is not put down
weight though was in coma.

1921
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:18,400
Shorty Raju is escaped.

1922
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:28,720
Doll, hey it is a doll!

1923
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:34,760
'You are taller than the sky.'

1924
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:43,080
Where is Indhu?

1925
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:51,520
Hello! It seems he is dead!

1926
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:07,120
Is he gone back to coma or what?

1927
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:09,400
Doctor, you! Thought it was someone else
and acted again.

1928
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:11,720
You have a great future
in acting, man.

1929
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,880
That Gangi Reddy fellow is falling behind
like an Alsatian dog, wherever I go.

1930
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:16,720
- I will take you carefully, come.
- Okay.

1931
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:24,840
Bloody crap! Why is this guy so behind me?
You go into coma, go go.

1932
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:37,000
Yes!

1933
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:41,720
Father, father!

1934
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,640
Your Bulli Reddy is come out
from coma father.

1935
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:47,240
Father, none in the house letting you
and me meet up father.

1936
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:49,080
Brothers are hitting me father.

1937
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:52,480
Why do you look so father?
Father, father, your Bulli Reddy father.

1938
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:55,880
Came out from coma father.
Speak, speak up father.

1939
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,440
Speak father--

1940
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:04,040
Hey! What are you all doing?

1941
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:06,000
Why is the one to be in the chair, here?

1942
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:08,680
Father! Brother these days
is walking in coma father.

1943
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:10,360
First you take him
and make him sleep inside.

1944
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:11,400
Okay father.

1945
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,040
All this might be
the work of that short fellow.

1946
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,480
We need to put a full stop
now to his character.

1947
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,680
Super man!

1948
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:27,880
Hey, maintain this acting the same
till you are taken to your father.

1949
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,400
There I will make you open the twist.

1950
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:33,360
Bulbs to your family members
and brain of your father would be burst.

1951
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:34,320
Okay!

1952
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,280
Peddi Reddy sir!

1953
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:41,200
Good balance Bulli Reddy.

1954
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:42,520
Peddi Reddy and family...

1955
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,960
...come on immediately.
Come on, come on I say!

1956
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,480
What, you bloody thick skinned idiot?

1957
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:48,440
What is that noise like
a monkey with a cut tail?

1958
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:51,280
Not saying noise like
a monkey with a cut tail.

1959
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:53,440
What is your way like
an elephant with cut trunk?

1960
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:55,960
Will readymade dresses be
available to your size?

1961
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:59,680
Teeth, teeth, teeth,
do not bite the teeth making that sound.

1962
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:01,000
My body is boiling here.

1963
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,680
Hey started searching
at 11 in the night...

1964
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:08,720
...and you are caught now
at 3 in the early morning.

1965
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:11,680
Hey, are these daughter in laws
or fire devils?

1966
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:14,040
Are these sons or bloody fools?

1967
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:17,080
Keeping the one who hit in front,
you sit crushing your own hands?

1968
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:21,560
If there is someone good in this house,
then the only pure guy is him.

1969
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:24,600
Hey! I read the headlines and
now Bulli Reddy will read the bulletin.

1970
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:26,200
Bulli Reddy, tell man.

1971
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:28,600
Tell! Open up the eyes of your father.

1972
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:31,400
It is getting late,
we shall eat and sleep.

1973
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:35,560
Why do you not speak?
Bulli Reddy!

1974
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:38,520
If you do not tell now...

1975
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,520
...you do not look like that man.
I will salute you, please.

1976
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:45,240
Tell Bulli Reddy.

1977
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:50,760
Tell Bulli Reddy.
Hey Bulli Reddy, Bulli Reddy.

1978
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:52,560
Tell you bloody, tell.

1979
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,840
Hey, you hit my son?

1980
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:57,520
This is just a sample sir.

1981
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:00,000
On whomever he gets irritation, everyday
he hits Bulli Reddy with the belt sir.

1982
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:02,520
Yes uncle! He had put scars with
the heated bar day before too.

1983
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:04,640
- Me?
- Beat this bloody guy.

1984
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:11,000
Stop! Now I got a clarity.

1985
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:13,400
He will not get up
and I will not go.

1986
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:15,640
Come on start!

1987
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:24,960
Is this photo of that
thick skinned guy or not? What?

1988
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:35,280
Hey, there was the photo here,
did that fly and come that side?

1989
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:38,640
Why don't you say anything?

1990
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:41,080
I doubt whether it is of
that short fellow or not.

1991
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:50,760
Hey, did the photo come that side?

1992
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:52,400
Nothing like that!

1993
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:57,840
Okay you will do your work.

1994
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:04,400
Though you knew that I hit your son,
why did you not tell madam?

1995
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:11,280
Son! What I need now is not
the one who hit my son.

1996
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:14,320
Stopped marriage of my daughter
needs to happen again.

1997
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:18,880
Though I have four sons, they could not
get the marriage of my daughter...

1998
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:21,520
...done and it is happening due
to this son given by God...

1999
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:24,640
...I cannot tell as a mother, son!

2000
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:37,640
Stop! Okay.

2001
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:40,040
Hello good morning sir.

2002
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:42,560
CBI Laxminarayana reporting sir!

2003
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:44,040
We just came to
the house of Peddi Reddy sir.

2004
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:45,760
We came to know that
the 1000 acres taken...

2005
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:47,760
...from the villagers is still
with Peddi Reddy, sir.

2006
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:52,040
We will stay here for one day and
observe and arrest Peddi Reddy, sir.

2007
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,680
Then we would start
the enquiry on Gangi Reddy sir.

2008
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:56,840
This is critical CBI information sir.

2009
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:58,000
CBI?

2010
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:02,240
Its worked.

2011
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:03,400
Bro in law, bro in law!

2012
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:04,680
CBI people came.

2013
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:07,480
It seems they would arrest the one
having the 1000 acres on their name.

2014
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:09,840
Has this fellow known it? What to do now?

2015
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:12,760
Immediately transfer that land
to my name bro in law.

2016
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:17,760
If you are arrested, our family would
lose the support of you the eldest man.

2017
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,280
Instead if I go to jail,
you will be there to get me out.

2018
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:25,920
I thought of cheating you,
but you thought about my good.

2019
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:29,320
I did a mistake bro in law, excuse me.

2020
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:34,440
Bro in law, either we both should be out,
else both should be in the jail.

2021
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:35,920
Do one thing.

2022
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:40,240
From the people you had that land written,
give it back to them in writing.

2023
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:43,600
How can that be boy? Is it one or two
to write, thousand acres man.

2024
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:46,680
Sir! You say great
about your grandfather, right?

2025
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:49,720
It is not because of the wealth
that people respected him so much...

2026
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:51,520
...but looking at his efficiency sir.

2027
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:56,160
Our elders status should
just not be in the idols sir...

2028
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:57,920
...but in the hearts of the people.

2029
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,560
What is the use of having how much
ever wealth, if you are gone to jail.

2030
01:59:04,120 --> 01:59:06,040
Will your families be happy?

2031
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:11,560
Still, what you both need in this age
is not thousands of acres property...

2032
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:13,320
...but thousands of
blessings from people.

2033
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:16,200
We have seen those bending heads
fearing us till now.

2034
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:19,480
We are now seeing the one saying
good words with head up.

2035
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:22,320
We will do as said by you.

2036
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:38,720
You all had asked the God
reason for the change in us.

2037
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,680
That God is none other than
this man!

2038
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:51,360
"That day Kousalya has not dreamt
to have the son Rama."

2039
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:57,280
"You are the result of good for lives,
came in without giving birth."

2040
01:59:57,320 --> 02:00:00,120
"Hey Sayyare sayyare
entire village has swung."

2041
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:03,240
"Hey Sayyare sayyare
entire village has swung."

2042
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:06,720
"Hey Sayyare sayyare
entire village has swung."

2043
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:21,040
"Enmity became relationship.
Fight of 25 years is put aside."

2044
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:27,080
"Distance is all come closer.
Festival to bang the drums is come here."

2045
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:30,240
"Hey either the strong
iron heart steadily standing..."

2046
02:00:30,280 --> 02:00:33,040
"...God sharing the love
wonderfully has come."

2047
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:36,280
"North and South spending
many lightings..."

2048
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:39,280
"...Sun changing to east has come down."

2049
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:43,080
"Globe should dance,
hearts should swell."

2050
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:47,840
"Entire public becomes colourful
and we all shall be one."

2051
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:54,320
"Hey Sayyare sayyare
entire village has swung."

2052
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:39,120
"Thousands army thousands
army thousands army thousands army."

2053
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:42,280
There was not so much confidence
when thousands of army was with."

2054
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:44,320
"All relation becomes one."

2055
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:48,080
"With carts of wealth
also there was not so much love."

2056
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:50,400
"When own people came nearer."

2057
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:56,880
"Sacred place is at our house,
heaven is the fore ground of doors."

2058
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:59,800
"Hey right now like this,
to the small hearts of us."

2059
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:03,040
"Hey sounds of drums banging
in this good time."

2060
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:07,040
"'Play the beats to a terrific rhythm."

2061
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:12,680
"Keep the priest aside,
tie the knot in the neck."

2062
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:26,080
"'This is a wonderful moment."

2063
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:32,400
"Our dreams come true
and beloved in the heart."

2064
02:02:56,840 --> 02:02:59,880
"Giving life.. Giving life..
Giving life.. Giving life."

2065
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:05,360
"Giving life received breath. Shared love
for this love and took the debits."

2066
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:11,600
"In the heart of vanished heart of the
girl. Knew what magic to do to stay in."

2067
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:14,840
"May be the soft eye lid of you
has safeguarded me."

2068
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:17,840
"May be your sharp smile
has cut in my heart."

2069
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:20,560
"At the time of good moment coming.
To sprinkle the perfumes of flowers."

2070
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:23,480
"Celebration of hearts
and affections at this time."

2071
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:27,560
"Bang the drum,
play that Shehnai man."

2072
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:33,840
"Keep the priest aside,
tie the knot in the neck."

2073
02:03:58,920 --> 02:03:59,960
- Hello.
- Kartik.

2074
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:03,920
I need to talk personally with you,
I am coming there.

2075
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:13,040
What to talk personally?

2076
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:18,080
Hey Indu, stop Indu.

2077
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:21,000
I am also watching.
Watching your games, songs and all!

2078
02:04:30,160 --> 02:04:32,720
Master! Idol of grandfather is broken.

2079
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:57,520
Please forgive me sir,
I was the one who broke that statue.

2080
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:02,800
Yes uncle!
He was the one who broke that.

2081
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:05,920
I have been safely keeping that from...

2082
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:08,360
...the time of our grandfather
and great grand fathers.

2083
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:10,680
Whoever is broken it...

2084
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,360
...I will not spare them.

2085
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:32,120
As you saved my life,
I am sparing your life now.

2086
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:34,960
If it was someone else...

2087
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:39,320
...this bullet would have got
into his heart by now...

2088
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,080
...all of you leave.

2089
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:10,360
I love you Kartik.

2090
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:12,360
I love you Kartik.

2091
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:18,880
Once you left your love
to make my love a success.

2092
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:23,200
Now to save the one I loved,
you put the remark on you.

2093
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:26,960
Your love is greater than my love Kartik.

2094
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:30,720
Making the never meeting
two families mix up...

2095
02:06:30,760 --> 02:06:32,880
...you are making the marriage happen.

2096
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:36,840
I am not able to forget all the moments
I had all these days with you.

2097
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:40,400
I cannot be leaving you Kartik.

2098
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:47,480
Wrong indu!
You should not love me.

2099
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:52,720
The moment you said there is
someone else in your heart...

2100
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:54,800
...I killed my love for you.

2101
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:03,040
Indu! Some decisions in life
should not be taken in vain or in anger.

2102
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:04,960
That is not good for anyone.

2103
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:09,080
You might have said this to me,
but never say to Vamsi.

2104
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:11,000
He would feel by listening to this.

2105
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:34,760
Why have you said no when Indu came
to you feeling to love you as yourself.

2106
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,240
Why are you leaving when the victory
itself is knocking your doors?

2107
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:41,800
Victory means to share happiness,
but not to keep it only with me dad!

2108
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:45,160
I changed the heart of Indu
as I wanted my marriage...

2109
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:46,560
...also along with the marriage
to happen in this house.

2110
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:51,080
When she called, hoped that she is coming
to me for saying the word in her heart.

2111
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:53,400
But, it was not Indu,
who came Daddy.

2112
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:57,400
Super man!
You did what you hoped for.

2113
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:00,400
I became your fan.
Do you know one thing?

2114
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:04,000
My daughter would either today
or tomorrow tell you I love you.

2115
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:08,600
But, by then I would show a short film.

2116
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:10,720
Why have you not said even
after knowing that...

2117
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:12,360
...I was the one who hit your son,
madam!

2118
02:08:13,280 --> 02:08:17,720
Son! What I need now is not
the one who hit my son.

2119
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:21,320
It is that the stopped marriage of
my daughter should happen.

2120
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:28,360
You used technique
to lock my daughter...

2121
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:30,880
...I used technology to lock you now.

2122
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:34,880
If I show this to Peddi Reddy now...

2123
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:37,440
...along with your marriage, he would stop
even the marriage of his house...

2124
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:39,960
...and kill all without even seeing
about own family.

2125
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:43,480
Stop!

2126
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:46,160
Marriage of daughter of
Peddi Reddy shall not stop.

2127
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:48,480
Marriage of my daughter
should not happen with you.

2128
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:52,040
It will not.

2129
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:54,400
Great! I liked your commitment.

2130
02:08:54,840 --> 02:08:58,200
You lose your love for the marriage
of daughter of an outsider?

2131
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:02,800
I will leave.

2132
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:05,440
What was the mistake
you have done to lose, son?

2133
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:06,880
You have done justice to a girl.

2134
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:08,640
But, it is again me
who should do justice...

2135
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:10,800
...to another girl had injustice
due to that, dad!

2136
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:14,040
Saying no to husband,
leaving out own sons...

2137
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:16,240
...and also knowing that marriage
of daughter is stalled due to me...

2138
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:18,240
...that mother is believed me dad.

2139
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:22,680
I cannot cheat such a mother,
right dad?

2140
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:30,600
Thus the two lives of two kids,
hopes of two mothers...

2141
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:32,920
...and the relationships of
two families...

2142
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:34,800
...thought that responsibility is mine.

2143
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:40,880
In this house shining with the happiness
of marriage in two days.

2144
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:44,880
I left the love of Indu as I did not
want tears to come back again.

2145
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:49,280
But, in every step forward there
are thousands of obstacles...

2146
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:52,480
...brothers trying to stop,
elders burning with revenge...

2147
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:54,480
...ladies whose hearts stop
if marriage is stopped.

2148
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:57,760
I have spent sleepless with the tension
that something may happen...

2149
02:09:57,800 --> 02:09:59,720
...if I close my eye lids dad.

2150
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:06,680
If I be sad even with
bundles of sadness in heart...

2151
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,520
...and have been spending days
like in hell dad.

2152
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:11,640
I had been pretending to laugh
with the fear that they may understand.

2153
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:15,440
Crossing an obstacle per hour
I brought this marriage to the hall daddy.

2154
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:21,280
I felt the hope of two mothers was more
important than the wish of mother.

2155
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,280
Mother gave me birth and life.

2156
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:29,120
With the courage that she would give
value to my word also, I did all this dad.

2157
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,800
I am not able to fulfil your wish...

2158
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:38,400
...can you forgive me mother!

2159
02:10:38,440 --> 02:10:41,600
The pain that my niece is not coming
as my daughter in law, son!

2160
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:47,120
The happiness that my son is become
a son to two more mothers is more than.

2161
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:52,120
All would have sons loving their mother.

2162
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:57,600
But, only I have the son who gives
importance to the position of mother.

2163
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:08,040
God gives responsibility
only to him who can withstand it.

2164
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:14,160
He does good to him for sure,
who takes it up heartfelt.

2165
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:30,920
Hey Karthik!

2166
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:32,400
If you want to get the marriage
of our sister done...

2167
02:11:32,440 --> 02:11:34,360
...which we do not like,
bride groom should be there, right?

2168
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:39,200
Either you come, kill us and take him
or you come and die, come man!

2169
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:44,320
What idiot, you say to have love me
and say I love you to that Karthik fellow?

2170
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:45,480
You think I am a big fool?

2171
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:46,400
What, what happened?

2172
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:48,120
It seems your daughter is
in love with that Karthik...

2173
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:49,320
Is she thinking that
I am a fool or what?

2174
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:50,920
- Not that, listen to what I say.
- Hey! What is it that you say?

2175
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:53,200
When I hit that Bulli Reddy for her,
have you seen what she did?

2176
02:11:53,240 --> 02:11:54,680
In real, what the plan is--

2177
02:11:56,680 --> 02:11:59,600
Hey, was it you who hit my son?
You bloody!

2178
02:12:04,680 --> 02:12:05,480
- Peddi Reddy.
- I will kill you.

2179
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:06,840
He was not the one who hit your son.

2180
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:09,320
We had lied to get the marriage
of my daughter done to him.

2181
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:12,720
Do you know who in real had
hit Bulli Reddy, that Karthik fellow?

2182
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:15,560
Are you playing drama?

2183
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:17,640
Not drama, look at this if you want.

2184
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,560
Why have you not saying even after
knowing that I hit your son madam?

2185
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:28,840
Hey, wherever that Karthik is,
drag and bring him here.

2186
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:08,080
He is not to be seen sir.

2187
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:09,960
His mom and dad are here sir.

2188
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,520
Stopped marriage of my daughter
needs to happen again.

2189
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:31,920
The struggles between us should become
an obstacle for the marriage of sister.

2190
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:33,240
Where is Praveen?

2191
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:36,080
Who are you to do the marriage
of our sister, idiot?

2192
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:44,280
I will give you enough of time
to take the revenge on me.

2193
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:45,880
Where is Praveen?

2194
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:04,000
I will kill him and
see into your matter.

2195
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:05,160
Move aside

2196
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:07,800
Today, you are standing
catching a gun in your hands...

2197
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:09,960
...means that is due to
the life saved by Karthik.

2198
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:20,440
He was the one who brought our
sons into the house, who were outside.

2199
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:28,320
He is the one getting the marriage of
our daughter once stopped.

2200
02:14:33,320 --> 02:14:36,280
It is not important for any mother
as to how many sons she has.

2201
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:39,560
It is enough if there is one son like
Karthik, who understands her heart.

2202
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:45,600
You want to kill Karthik,
first you kill all of us.

2203
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:53,560
Hey, get him.

2204
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:01,720
Hey, before killing you...

2205
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:05,160
..I will kill your thought of getting
the marriage of my sister with this guy.

2206
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:51,520
Hey! If I catch the knife, 25 heads would
be cut before the sharpness is down.

2207
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:54,520
You have till now seen
the one bearing...

2208
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,040
...but if you come as
an obstacle to this marriage...

2209
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:59,520
...you will see
the one ready for anything.

2210
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:43,760
Father.

2211
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:46,280
Why are you hitting brother
when he is killing the enemy, father?

2212
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:49,480
You hit or kill us
for lying to you, father.

2213
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:51,640
But, he is the one who hit Bulli Reddy.

2214
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:54,120
By killing him who played
with us by making us fools...

2215
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:55,800
...we will prove that we are men now.

2216
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:00,760
Hey idiots! Man means not the one
who killed or chopped ten people outside.

2217
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:06,240
The one who understands
the heart of ladies at home is a man.

2218
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:11,080
Your wives and mother
at home are not believing you.

2219
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:14,320
They believed Karthik coming
from outside.

2220
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:17,520
When our eyes are closed with revenge...

2221
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:20,320
...we ignored the marriage
of our own girl...

2222
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:22,520
...but he got it done with love.

2223
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:29,080
Obul Reddy! To share love to all of us,
he has left out his love.

2224
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:33,880
You know, what has he finally done.

2225
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:38,400
For the wish of your mother,
he is left the dream of his mother out.

2226
02:18:45,480 --> 02:18:46,840
Kartik!

2227
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:48,800
If you want to do this marriage...

2228
02:18:48,840 --> 02:18:50,960
...you have the guts to oppose all of us
and get it done.

2229
02:18:51,600 --> 02:18:54,320
But, though you had a threat to your life
in this house you stayed...

2230
02:18:54,360 --> 02:18:56,160
...among enemies
with a smile on your face.

2231
02:18:57,320 --> 02:18:58,640
Though it was not your mistake...

2232
02:18:58,680 --> 02:19:01,040
...you took the slap
with this hand and bent your head.

2233
02:19:01,360 --> 02:19:04,040
You put the responsibility of this family
like the eldest son of this family.

2234
02:19:04,640 --> 02:19:09,160
We are not your relatives,
not friends...

2235
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:14,320
...and why did you do all this for
our family, whom you do not even know.

2236
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:17,120
For me mine and ours is not important...

2237
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:19,160
...which is correct is
the important thing.

2238
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:23,000
I also became the reason
for the breakup of a marriage...

2239
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:26,000
...taking place for
two families to become one.

2240
02:19:26,920 --> 02:19:31,320
I did all this for the two separated
families to do this marriage together sir!

2241
02:19:31,360 --> 02:19:33,640
The one killing enemies
would stand as victorious...

2242
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:37,800
...but the one who kills enmity would
stand in the history like you.

2243
02:19:46,720 --> 02:19:48,240
Sir, he is not sprinkling.

2244
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:51,160
Yes, I sprinkled, sprinkled.

2245
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:18,720
Okay, you all are happy, right?

2246
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:19,880
I would leave now.

2247
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:22,760
Where do you go? Wake him up
from coma and then leave.

2248
02:20:23,160 --> 02:20:26,160
Wake him up from coma? Do you think
he is taken a quarter and slept?

2249
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:27,560
Offer is mind blowing right, Raju sir?

2250
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:28,400
Offer?

2251
02:20:29,920 --> 02:20:32,760
"Hot hot parrot as you scratched me."

2252
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:35,640
"Your dad knows
the hit that banged in sound."

2253
02:20:41,160 --> 02:20:43,920
"Barampuram bell you kept a great twist."

2254
02:20:43,960 --> 02:20:47,080
"Now the love bell will ring
in your heart."

2255
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:52,720
"Mustache like a mine,
anger like the salt grave."

2256
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:58,160
"Seen the dare of breaking bones,
saluted with you."

2257
02:20:58,200 --> 02:21:00,680
"Hey will like a man and elope you."

2258
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:03,440
"Will see who comes in the way
and will break if comes."

2259
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:06,280
"Will beat up and down
and show my power."

2260
02:21:06,320 --> 02:21:09,280
"The back stopping me
will be banged up badly."

2261
02:21:09,320 --> 02:21:11,880
"Hot hot parrot as you scratched me."

2262
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:14,760
"Your dad knows
the hit that banged in sound."
