2
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,300
The sword..

3
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,010
Have you gone deaf?

4
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,960
I said give me the sword. Hurry up .

5
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,420
Father...

6
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,050
Can I come along?

7
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,800
Sita, keep mum and eat your food

8
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,040
Girls can’t go along

9
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,100
But why?

10
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,130
Girls can’t ask questions either.

11
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,590
You better make her understand that.

12
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,630
Come brother, Joravar

13
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,250
Why hasn’t it started yet?

14
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,470
The Dholi (drummer) hasn’t come yet

15
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,550
We’re waiting for him

16
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,550
These lowborn Dholis (drummers) have started
acting too pricey

17
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,840
The whole territory
is suffering from the drought

18
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,180
and these Dholis are anyway so few in number

19
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,040
Every village hosts prayers for the rain.
Naturally, they’ll act pricey

20
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,250
Hey

21
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,790
Give it some space.

22
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,050
It’s getting suffocated
that’s why it’s not playing

23
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,260
Is it not able to catch the single (signal)?

24
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,430
Eh Petha, stay a little away from the radio.

25
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,000
The radio waves are hitting your back
and bouncing away

26
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,220
Here, I’ll sit down. Fine?

27
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,750
Eh, that worked like magic!
- Petha, do one thing.

28
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,390
You lie down flat
so that the signal is crystal clear

29
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:20,790
(Radio Announcement)

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,220
Hey Ravji

31
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,710
Such a sweet voice, right?

32
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:29,420
Without a doubt,
but could not understand a thing, right?

33
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,750
Aye Ranmal

34
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,590
You have tuned into enemy nation’s (Pakistan) radio station.

35
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,720
Tune into ours.

36
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,300
Eh, Mukhi baapa (head of the village)

37
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,590
Eh

38
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,880
It’s time for the prayer to begin.
Why are you toying around with that radio again?

39
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,710
Oh Goddess, please send some signals
to his brain too

40
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,380
(Radio Announcement)

41
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:19,170
According to the latest weather forecast, there will be mild to
heavy rains in Central Gujarat, South Gujarat

42
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:26,630
whereas in Kutch and all of western Gujarat,
monsoon rains will begin in the coming week.

43
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,590
Now, it won’t rain for sure!

44
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,340
Eyy, idiot.
They have machines to forecast.

45
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,430
They don’t conjure the news from thin air.

46
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,500
But Father, the radio has been making it rain
since the last two years.

47
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,340
But what about the clouds?
They beg to differ.

48
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,920
Look, the Dholi is here
(Radio announcement continues)

49
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:53,920
Today, on All India Radio, India’s Prime Minister
has declared a state of emergency across the country.

50
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,330
Let’s listen to her message-

51
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:12,080
Oh Mother, we devote this first garba
of the season to you

52
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,970
Give us a sign, Mother,
for any mistakes made or inadequacies served

53
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,920
If there is any act, ceremony or sacrifice
you want us to perform, please tell us

54
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,080
Please don’t leave our land dry
for the third consecutive year

55
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,050
or we will have to leave this village and go.

56
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:49,080
Hail the Goddess.

57
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,560
Oh Mother, you bring peace to the world

58
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,650
and usher prosperity

59
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:22,260
I bow down to you, and offer my prayers, Oh Great one

60
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:31,010
We remember you with reverence, Oh Mother

61
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,480
Your lamps are burning incessantly

62
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,360
Please make your presence felt and bless us

63
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:17,800
The lofty flags are flying in your abode,
Oh Goddess

64
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:26,270
Come soon to play and shower your
blessings upon us

65
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,510
Ma

66
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,380
Why can’t we do Garba (dance)?

67
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,080
Don’t you ever feel like doing Garba?

68
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,510
Sleep now.

69
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:17,230
Call back your river of emotions

70
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:23,100
Sheath your lightning

71
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,440
Call back your river of emotions

72
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,430
Sheath your lightning

73
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,930
Halt the ringing of your anklets

74
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,600
Stud your path with thorns

75
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,850
And pray to the Goddess for
a lonesome night

76
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:59,430
A night without dreams

78
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,380
This issue is regarding
the water supply in Jeeva’s house.

79
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,500
Nobody is ready to fetch water for them.

80
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,430
It’s not that nobody is ready to do it

81
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,250
but who will carry the extra pots?

82
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,090
All women need to manage
the pots for their own houses.

83
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,300
Jeeva is bedridden and Santok (his wife)
is too old to go.

84
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,180
The only person left now
is their daughter-in-law, Kesar.

85
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,960
But she is a widow.

86
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,260
She isn’t allowed.
- But what is the other option?

87
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,340
We can’t let them die of thirst.

88
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,300
Let me think for a moment.

89
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,750
The Goddess will show us the way.

90
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,040
Wow, Mukhi baapa!

91
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,840
You’ve thought of the perfect thing to do!
What an idea!

92
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,390
(Crowd cheering)

93
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,890
He is the head of the village
for a reason!

94
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,710
You’ve thought of the perfect thing, Sir.

95
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,880
But what has he thought?

96
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,080
That Sundar’s widow Kesar will go fetch water
with the rest of the women.

97
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,590
Are you out of your mind, Bhagla?

98
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,630
A widow will go out?

99
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,290
Arrey, Mukhi baapa has suggested this solution.

100
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,210
And it seems 100 percent correct.

101
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,290
In the nearby villages of Bhuj and Anjar,
the women go to watch movies as well.

102
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,920
So, if we go by the ways of the society --
Society,

103
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,710
Bhagla, society.

104
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,710
The society will dance naked.

105
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,130
Does it mean we should too?

106
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,880
No no, we just have to allow her
to fetch water. That’s it..

107
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,630
Now, we can’t let three people
die without water.

108
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,840
This is the only way.

109
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,880
Tell all the women of the village
to not talk to her.

110
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,380
Also, tell them to keep an eye on her

111
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,710
It is anyway an empty, salt dessert.

112
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,710
Even if she wants to do anything wrong,

113
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,880
who is she going to meet there?

114
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,540
This discussion is over, now.

115
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,640
Tell me, Bhagla

116
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,130
What have you brought for us from the city?

117
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,710
I’ve brought salt,

118
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,040
some grains and cloth as well.

119
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,010
Here

120
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,460
And any news?

121
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,500
In the latest news, Emergency

122
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,640
Emergency?

123
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,130
It has been imposed throughout the country.
Emergency.

124
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,260
Even in Kutch?

125
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,510
Yes. Kutch is also a part of the country, father..

126
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,590
That’s right.

127
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,420
But what happens during an Emergency?

128
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,630
You can’t speak a word against the government.

129
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,290
Or else, they can put you behind bars.

130
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,640
The government has not been able
to reach here

131
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,000
how will the Emergency get to us?

132
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:33,510
This is what happens
when you let a woman run the country.

133
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,720
Anything else?

134
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,760
Another thing is that,

135
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,260
Deva baapa,

136
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,090
your son Arjan’s letter has come from the army.

137
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,040
Here, read it.

138
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,050
Hail the Goddess

139
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,430
Just tell us what it says.

140
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Deva baapa,

141
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,080
Arjan has been granted leave for his wedding.

142
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,550
But only for 10 days.

143
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,090
Why just for 10 days?
- Emergency.

144
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,550
See baapa.
The Emergency has already reached you.

145
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,580
We’ll have to host the wedding
as soon as Arjan is back..

146
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,640
And it will be great if you don’t allow
the widow to fetch water until then..

147
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,380
It's inauspicious

148
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,420
Alright

149
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,590
Sundar’s widow will go to fetch water
after Arjan’s wedding.

150
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,960
Till then, the water for their house --

151
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,880
You’re right, Sir!

152
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,290
Till then, they can take
the water they need from your house.

153
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,140
(crowd cheering)

154
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,250
Not yet

155
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,260
See? He’s the head of the village for a reason!

156
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,590
(crowd cheering)

157
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,460
Okay then, Devaji,

158
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,080
start preparing for the celebration.

159
00:15:55,104 --> 00:16:05,104
<font color="#00ff00">Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:-</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain</font>

160
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,090
Are you educated?

161
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,330
How far?

162
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,000
Seventh grade.

163
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,630
Huh?

164
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,760
Seventh grade

165
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,000
That’s too much

166
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,180
I’ve heard
that educated girls somehow grow wings.

167
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,790
And some grow horns, too.

168
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,340
What have you grown?

169
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,220
Here, in our village,

170
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,590
the rules of the caste come first.

171
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,340
Better know your limits.

172
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,540
No matter what you’ve grown,
wings or horns,

173
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,330
cut them on your own.

174
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,580
If I cut them,
it will hurt more.

175
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,790
I’d heard
that my bride is very beautiful.

176
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,330
But I didn’t know
she would be this beautiful.

177
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,590
You have to go fetch water.

178
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,920
You’re late.

179
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,580
The women are waiting outside.

180
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,430
Wait

181
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,510
Eh.. Did anyone see her face?

182
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,720
Arjan Bhai must have
seen her face last night.

183
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,580
Would he even have seen the face?

184
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,010
I’ve heard she’s very beautiful.

185
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,800
Now, all that beauty
will remain within four walls of her home.

186
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,590
All her beauty and knowledge
will be blown off in the kitchen.

187
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:56,250
And then, she will go from the village to the lake
and from the lake to the village, all her life.

188
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,550
With us, like us.

189
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,050
Not like us.

190
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,330
She’s from the city.

191
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,140
A wife neither belongs to a village nor a city..

192
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,790
she only belongs to her husband.

193
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,790
Go now.

194
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,720
Wait everyone, wait here!

195
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,460
Listen, Manjhri.

196
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:31,080
This is Gauri, Champa, Radha,
Mena, Ganga, Gomti, Rudi, Kanchan.

197
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,550
Phew.

198
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,540
Now if I start introducing everyone,
we’ll reach the lake

199
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,800
and then we won’t be able to talk.

200
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,050
And if we’re not able to talk,
we feel constipated.

201
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,430
See, the only time we talk and listen is
when we go to fetch water.

202
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:48,170
Other than that, we have to put a knot to this
snake of a tongue and put it away.

203
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,330
But then,
what if this suffocated snake, stings?

204
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,390
Even then we end up poisoning ourselves.

205
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,830
Arrey Gomti, don’t get started
on snakes and poison.

206
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,220
Let’s ask her quickly
or we’ll run out of time.

207
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,930
What do you want to ask?

208
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,000
See, the only new thing
that comes to this village is a bride.

209
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,720
Other than that,
nothing new happens here.

210
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,750
That’s why we have a lot to ask.

211
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,260
Okay, start asking then.

212
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:16,680
Will answer what I know,
and if I fail, I fail.

213
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,390
Don’t worry, we are all failures here.

214
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,550
Start walking or we'll get late.

215
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,330
First, tell me what kind of people
are there in the city?

216
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,180
Weird kind. They walk on their heads, have three hands
and a wheel attached to their feet.

217
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,640
They’re just all of like us, of course.

218
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,710
How much have you studied?
- A little.

219
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,000
Enough to be able to read.

220
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,010
Ah. Make her read.

221
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,680
It will be so much fun
to watch a woman swiftly read a board!

222
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,880
But there are no boards to read, here.

223
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,930
One can only find boards in the city.

224
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,210
That’s Kesar.

225
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:21,550
She’s the widow of Jivabha’s son, Sundar.

226
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,580
She has come out of the house
after a year and a half.

227
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,840
But what is she doing?

228
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,590
I think she’s out of her mind.
- Stay.

229
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,210
Anyone would lose their mind
after being caged for so long.

230
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:48,290
She’s just been released from a prison.

231
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,640
She just wants to
feel free for a moment here.

232
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,680
How do you know?

233
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,010
I can read the boards of her heart from here.

234
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,760
Remember, we aren’t allowed to talk to her.

235
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,590
I’m Manjhri

236
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,590
You shouldn’t have talked to her.

237
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,720
That’s the rule.

238
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,540
Rules are theirs and the game as well.

239
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,720
It’s enough that we are victims of it.

240
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,000
We don’t have to play the game.

241
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,340
Hmm

242
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,800
Seems like the woman from the city
has a big mouth.

243
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,640
Her husband is going to have a hard time.

244
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,830
Brother

245
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,590
Did you fire the gun properly or not?

246
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,830
If it was upto me,

247
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,330
I would have fired all six bullets.

248
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,420
But she gave up in just two rounds.

249
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,680
Arjan must have been
in a forgiving mood at the time.

250
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:52,210
Otherwise, he’s capable of pulling up
a tired enemy and firing again.

251
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,210
He’s an army man.
He never misses his aim.

252
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,420
Okay stop you two.

253
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,290
You’ll also get married one day.

254
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:04,260
Don’t take too much ‘interest’
in other peoples’ private matters.

255
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,590
Oh ho.

256
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,630
Bhaglo has started speaking
English quite a lot.

257
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,460
I pick it up from people in the city.

258
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,250
And a little from the ‘cinema’ as well.

259
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,880
The Cinema?

260
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,220
The Movies?

261
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,960
Movies.

262
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,970
Arjan, I saw a movie
of you army guys in Bhuj recently.

263
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,250
It’s called Haqeeqat! Ahaa..
Such a fierce gun fight.

264
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,290
Did you get hurt?

265
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,180
Aren’t you scared being at the border?

266
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,290
Afraid of what?

267
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,580
Either you kill or get killed.

268
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,220
Is infiltration from Pakistan still a problem?

269
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,790
I’m near the Chinese border.

270
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,510
Near the Himalayas.

271
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,220
Oho, so all fair complexioned girls that side?

272
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,420
Oho

273
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,080
Now, instead of talking about other girls,
concentrate on your wife, Gauri.

274
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,090
It seems like your gun
is firing in thin air.

275
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,800
It’s been 15 months to your wedding.
And still no result.

276
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,000
Is it a real gun?
Or a toy gun?

277
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,220
Bhagla,

278
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,170
Tell us about that movie, no!

279
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,540
Which one? Hakikat?

280
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,340
No no. ‘Baabi’!

281
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
It’s ‘Bobby’.

282
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,000
Yes.. The one with the girl in the shorts.

283
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,840
Yes, that pretty one.

284
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,790
Oh, I remember.
Last time, you told us the story till that song.

285
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,930
‘Hum tum.. Chaabi kho jaaye’
(What if we are locked inside a room and the lock won't open)

286
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,180
I think we’ll have to
get these two married.

287
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,000
They’ve started thinking from down there.

288
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,300
Hail the Goddess!

289
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,010
Please don’t get up.

290
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,390
Let me put it inside for you.

291
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,640
You're in your ninth month
of pregnancy, right?

292
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,960
Yes, the last month.

293
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,330
Does the baby kick yet or not?

294
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,460
Eh baby.
Kick, no?

295
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,710
It kicks on its own whim.

296
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,500
Eh

297
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,470
It kicked.

298
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,670
I was just thinking

299
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,540
that it will be a good day if it kicked.

300
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,390
See, it sensed what you wanted.

301
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,000
It can already hear the voices of one’s heart.

302
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,630
I am certain it’s a girl.

303
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,750
Hail the Goddess Amba, Mukhi Baapa!

304
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,720
Are you leaving?

305
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,140
Yes.
- Listen.

306
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,960
He wants to talk to us.
(tells the horse)

307
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,500
You stay here.

308
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,010
Yes. Yes.

309
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,670
When you go to Bhuj next,
get some Opium from Barmer (village).

310
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:14,460
When the mind is tensed,
it feels good to smoke up a little.

311
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,330
Don’t be so tensed,
everything will be fine.

312
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,920
That reminds me.

313
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,630
The museum people
were asking for this canon again.

314
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,010
They’ll give us decent money too.
The village will benefit a little.

315
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,840
I have already refused once.

316
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,890
Haven’t you told them that this canon
has been in our village for years now?

317
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,750
I told them that.

318
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,050
But the museum people are saying

319
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:43,000
that we’re asking for it
precisely because it is ancient.

320
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:47,300
They also said that it’s just a canon,
not some old temple

321
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,930
that if we give it away,
the Goddess will be angry.

322
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,670
Listen, this canon was here before us.

323
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,760
We don’t know
if it’s a divine signal.

324
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,340
It’s just our duty to protect it.

325
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,890
This, I told them this too..

326
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,750
that it’s our duty to protect it.

327
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,140
Then they told me. You fool,

328
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,250
in this drought
your village is going to turn into a museum.

329
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,510
Then, will you eat this relic of yours?

330
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,580
But I clearly explained to them

331
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,180
that our chieftain has refused.

332
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,880
And his verdict is final

333
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,840
So, finally you don't want to give it, right?

334
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,840
Alright.

335
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,460
Final?

336
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,550
Let’s get out of here.
Don’t stop before we reach Bhuj (village).

337
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,790
It’s for baapuji..

338
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,300
He coughed a lot last night..
This will make him feel better.

339
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,550
I used to make it for my grandfather.

340
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,420
Manjhri!

341
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,000
All this must not happen here.

342
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,830
Women of this village aren’t allowed
to do embroidery work

343
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,000
But why?

344
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,420
She was the widow of Karsan.

345
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,500
Muli

346
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:14,220
Before Bhaglo,
Kano used to come from the city.

347
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,760
What is that?

348
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,680
That is my embroidery work.

349
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,710
Can I have a look?
- Yes please, wait.

350
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,300
Women can't work
to earn money here.

351
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:42,210
It’s like selling yourself in the market.

352
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:51,420
But Kano secretly started taking away
Muli’s embroidery work to sell in the city.

353
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:57,130
She shouldn't have
forgotten her place.

354
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,420
One day, the secret got exposed.

355
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,050
But before anyone could do anything,

356
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,510
Muli fled with him.

357
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:22,920
She ran away to live happily but the dimwit,
she got our embroidery banned for life.

358
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:30,710
The men burnt all our threads,
needles and cloth in the village.

359
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,290
We searched them
for a very long time

360
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,890
but couldn’t find them anywhere.

361
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,580
The Goddess got angry.

362
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,760
It did not rain
for three years after that.

363
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,210
The priest said

364
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:51,000
unless they are found and sacrificed to the Goddess,
it will not rain.

365
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,960
One day, a news came

366
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,630
that they live in Anjar.

367
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:06,050
I, myself, had cleaned the blood stains
from this sword

368
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,750
Mother,

369
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,720
what happened then,

370
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,170
Did it rain that year?

371
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,050
You fool.

372
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,680
Go away from here.

373
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,220
Brother Ranmal.

374
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,330
Arjan has a wife now.

375
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,720
He is younger than you, right?

376
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,640
Okay, elder than you.

377
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,540
No!

378
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,300
He is younger than me.

379
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,430
So, when is your turn, then?

380
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,920
My to be wife is still quite young..

381
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,130
And you?

382
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,710
I’m grown up.

383
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,580
Are you sure?

384
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,510
Of course, I need to grow older.

385
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,010
Otherwise who will be the next chieftain?
Your father?

386
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,760
Not a word against my father!

387
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,680
Then should I talk about your mother?

388
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,460
Come on.
Take my mother’s name now.

389
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,630
Take my mother’s name now.

390
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,000
Yes. I will, definitely,
take the great mother’s name.

391
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:37,800
Today is the second full moon.
Mother Goddess Amba, please bless us with rain..

392
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,840
We lay today’s prayer dance at your feet.

393
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,890
Don’t hesitate brother,

394
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,130
dance as much as you desire.

395
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,880
Alright, do what you please.

396
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,040
Oh great Goddess. You have 1000 hands!

397
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,640
Please make it rain. Goddess.
Please make it rain.

398
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,010
Did you do Garba
in your village?

399
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,180
Yes.

400
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,670
In this village, you can’t.

401
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,080
Come here, look at this.
Something is pricking me.

402
00:37:50,590 --> 00:38:01,510
Keep your dreams to yourself

403
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:08,640
Smother all your desires

404
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:19,710
Halt the ringing of your anklets

405
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,580
Stud your path with thorns

406
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:31,050
And pray to the Goddess for
a lonesome night

407
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:38,680
A night without dreams

408
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,540
Isn’t it weird?

409
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:08,260
When it does not rain, they get to do Garba
and we have to fast (restrain from eating).

410
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,840
That’s how it has always been.

411
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,090
We endure all the pain
and they get to be the father.

412
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,220
I broke the fast yesterday.

413
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:16,290
Really?
- What, really?

414
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,720
I was famished.
I should have died or what?

415
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,710
It will, definitely, not rain now.

416
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,500
Wait.

417
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,590
There’s someone lying there.

418
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,880
He's a man.

419
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,290
You shouldn’t go near him. Let’s leave.

420
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,340
Let’s go. Hurry up.

421
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,300
Someone would have killed him and
dumped him there.

422
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,390
But nobody comes this side.

423
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,430
Looks like he died of thirst.
Come on, let’s go.

424
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,830
What if he’s alive?

425
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,890
Water-

426
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,180
He'll die!

427
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,920
Let him. Lets leave.

428
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,540
I am a widow.

429
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:16,880
Everyone is waiting eagerly
to point fingers at my character.

430
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,830
If I was blessed like you,

431
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,340
I would have given him water.

432
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,960
Still if no one does anything,
I’ll give him water.

433
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,470
Otherwise someone else will become a widow
and suffer, like me.

434
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,390
Whose Dhol is this?

435
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,090
It's mine

436
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,790
Will you play?

437
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,840
Let’s go now.
Are you out of your mind?

438
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
Let's leave.

439
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,040
You’ve saved my life.

440
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:38,064
<font color="#00ff00">Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:-</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain</font>

441
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:40,000
<font color="#00ff00">Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:-</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain</font>

442
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,420
All of you started dancing
without a drop of shame.

443
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,920
So what?
No one saw us, right?

444
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,330
The Goddess sees everything.

445
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,630
Now wait for the consequences.

446
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,210
Uncle!

447
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,290
What happens when a dog wails?

448
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,640
How was it wailing?

449
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:12,800
(wails)

450
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,840
In this way.

451
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,800
Was it shivering?

452
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,050
Yes, it was.

453
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,000
(wails)

454
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,470
It’s okay, it’s okay. Relax.

455
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,330
There’ll be an earthquake.

456
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,580
Mother,

457
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:44,210
what should I cook for lunch?

458
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,960
Mother.

459
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:51,930
What has happened to you, mother.

460
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,580
Mother!

461
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:54,140
Don’t leave us!

462
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,340
Let me sleep, you fool!

463
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,010
Eh wait.

464
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:34,220
*mumbling prayers*

465
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:44,250
Run.

466
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,260
Earthquake! Earthquake!

467
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,470
Where?

468
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,130
You were spooked.
- No, you were.

469
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:53,290
Let's go.
- Don’t tell anyone.

470
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:24,840
Did anything weird happen at anyone’s place?
- No.

471
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,510
Anything strange?
- No.

472
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,220
So do we dance today?

473
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:51,760
A drum reverberates and rolls

474
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:59,060
In the empty desert of my mind

475
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:05,480
Oh it has broadened

476
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:12,680
The horizon of my caged mind has broadened a bit

477
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,840
A drum reverberates and rolls

478
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:19,600
In the empty desert of my mind

479
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:46,890
A drum reverberates and rolls

480
00:50:53,720 --> 00:51:07,140
I was the one stopping myself from flying

481
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:14,340
I fluttered a little but soon grounded myself

482
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:17,850
I was out of breath,

483
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:21,270
I was out of breath by just a sliver of joy

484
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:10,600
I did not sleep

485
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:17,480
For the sake of a few dreams, I didn’t sleep

486
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:26,060
I put a charm,

487
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:40,060
To keep the evil eye away from my dreams and hopes

488
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:46,350
A drum reverberates and rolls

489
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:53,310
In the empty desert of my mind

490
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:59,480
Oh it has broadened

491
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:19,590
The horizon of my caged mind has broadened

492
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,800
You have thorns in your feet or what?

493
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,720
No.

494
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,550
We’re not comfortable with this.

495
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:03,390
Dancing in front of some stranger –
- I’m..

496
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,640
I’m Mulji

497
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,390
Caste?

498
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:17,600
Have you lost your way?

499
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,550
Yes.

500
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,420
Seems like there’s no one in his family.

501
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,420
There is

502
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:35,890
I have a wife, Mangla

503
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,210
and a daughter,

504
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,640
Reva

505
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,640
Reva

506
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,790
Where are they?

507
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,600
They're right here, with me

508
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,130
Reva

509
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,420
Where did she run off to? Reva...

510
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,220
Mangla

511
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,100
Reva

512
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,290
Eh Mangla..

513
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,930
Reva

514
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:23,710
He’ll go directly to the city, no?

515
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,800
And then where?
- That I don’t know.

516
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,640
To the border

517
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:29,290
To all those beautiful women?

518
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,180
No, to the bullets.
- The bullets!

519
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:33,970
That’s it.

520
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:37,050
There’s no need
to pack 6 months of food.

521
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,760
When will you come back now?

522
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,180
I'm not sure.

523
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,750
Even a week hasn’t passed
to your wedding.

524
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,350
When will you take her along?

525
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,630
Her?

526
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,840
I cannot take her with me.

527
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,130
There’s continuous firing.

528
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:25,090
Blasts can be heard all the time.

529
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:36,250
It is not a place for women.
It is not their cup of tea.

530
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:42,380
What?

531
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:42,380
What?

532
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,890
Manjhri

533
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,680
Aye Manjhri,
where are you lost?

534
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,090
Nothing.

535
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:02,540
Already missing Arjan bhai or what?

536
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,250
Chuck it.

537
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,510
I have started my fast from today.

538
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,970
You haven’t cooked yet?

539
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:13,750
Manjhri..

540
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:18,800
I have cooked
one extra piece of bread for him!

541
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,290
Bread in exchange of
him playing the drum, eh?

542
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:25,390
Not just bread… If I could, I  would give away my empire.
I just don’t have one.

543
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,680
And not only me,
any of us would do the same.

544
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:35,220
For the first time I’ve seen women
waiting eagerly to go fetch water.

545
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,220
Leela! O Leela!

546
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,100
Coming, mother.

547
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,250
I'm going now.
See you tomorrow morning.

548
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,510
To fetch water.

549
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:43,880
And to dance.

550
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,850
Amba Baa,

551
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,540
Open the door.

552
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:04,050
Come fast.
Hansa is in labour.

553
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:18,790
Don’t you think it is taking too long?

554
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,680
The sun is about to rise

555
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:24,040
and a child born during sunrise
is said to be very lucky.

556
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:34,750
It was a girl.

557
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,300
She was stillborn.
Could not survive.

558
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,170
Look at her, walking as if nothing has happened.

559
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:09,470
How many more lives do you wish to take?

560
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:13,880
An innocent child died because of our sin.

561
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:19,220
I told you from the beginning
that this is not your city, it’s a village.

562
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:22,250
Even if nobody else does,
the Goddess sees everything.

563
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:26,550
So, are you saying that Goddess of the village
and the city are different?

564
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,390
What do you consider her to be?

565
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:37,290
Would she consider such a small joy as a sin and punish us for it?
This is what you assume her to be?

566
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,550
We don’t have the permission to feel joyous.

567
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,180
You have broken a rule.

568
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:44,000
Okay, let’s assume we have

569
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:50,290
We did. So, why did someone else get punished for it?

570
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:53,800
Eyy. We are not even supposed to talk with you.

571
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,470
She’s right.

572
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:58,960
Why did an unborn child
get the punishment for our sins?

573
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,000
Hansa never did Garba.

574
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,080
We did.

575
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:04,090
We didn't.

576
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:07,710
You did.

577
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,510
Your daughter died
because of someone else’s sins.

578
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:58,550
You weren’t coming to the lake during the final days
of your pregnancy,

579
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:01,470
so you wouldn't know.

580
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:03,170
What?

581
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:05,380
I'll tell you.

582
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:17,290
We found a dholi on our way to the lake.

583
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,260
He was dying of thirst and we saved his life.

584
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:27,470
and we dance to his music.

585
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:33,300
Radha thinks that because of that sin of ours,
your daughter died.

586
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,670
If you think so too,

587
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,830
I’m standing right in front of you.

588
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,250
I’ll take whatever punishment you give me.

589
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,550
The person whose sins
have caused my daughter to die,

590
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:58,800
is sitting on the cot outside,
smoking his pipe.

591
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:06,830
I pleaded him a hundred times,

592
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:10,890
not to beat me for these nine months.

593
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,090
Yesterday, he pushed me and..

594
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:37,590
I was writhing in pain here
and he sat outside, smoking his pipe

595
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:43,430
You have committed no sin.

596
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:49,630
And not all sinners get punished.

597
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:55,140
If it was like that then the world
wouldn’t have so many men in it.

598
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:06,210
Once my body recovers,

599
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:06,210
Once my body recovers,

600
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:09,220
I’ll also come,

601
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,800
with you all,

602
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,830
to do Garba, to dance.

603
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:28,750
This hollow womb might feel better
listening to the sounds of the hollow dhol.

604
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:36,460
Sita!

605
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:38,170
Sita

606
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:39,930
Wake up.

607
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,550
Come.

608
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:45,510
Where?

609
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,220
To fetch water.

610
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,380
We won’t die of thirst anymore.

611
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,260
Maa,

612
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:02,180
now we’ll come here to dance everyday, no?

613
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:03,040
Yes.

614
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,930
Yes, we will come to dance.

615
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,420
But do you know what to tell them?
Why are we here?

616
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:20,540
That we’re going to fetch water!

617
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:21,300
What?

618
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:25,580
What is your name?

619
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,260
You can turn around.

620
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,140
She is like your daughter.

621
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,000
Reva

622
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:39,960
Sita

623
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:44,260
Reva, my daughter’s name.

624
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:46,930
She’s about your age.

625
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,170
Where is she?

626
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,090
Here,

627
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,760
somewhere around here...

628
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:00,260
You take this.

629
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:02,870
This too.

630
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,930
This will give you some shade.

631
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:16,680
Can you play the dhol again for me,

632
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:17,710
just for a bit

633
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:16,220
He won’t tell anyone

634
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:19,670
If he wanted to, the horse would have turned around
straight towards the village.

635
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:21,420
They’ll cut off our heads.

636
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,870
This won’t go unpunished,
if the men come to know.

637
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:26,260
Where are you going?

638
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,210
Now, I can’t stay here.

639
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,430
These people will really kill us.

640
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:39,000
Those few moments that we play Garba to your rhythm,
we feel alive.

641
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:44,430
Other than that, what’s life for us anyway?

642
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:48,920
Only the sound of the winds
and the silence of the houses.

643
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:55,870
There are no loving hands
or kind eyes anywhere.

644
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,840
We’re humans.

645
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,120
We’re getting to live a little because of your music

646
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,720
Now, we won’t stop living for the fear of dying.

647
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:11,550
We’re not as courageous as you, Manjhri.

648
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:13,300
Look,

649
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:16,720
what had to happen, has already happened.

650
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,760
He has already seen us.

651
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:23,580
And if he wants to tell them,
he will tell the village folk anyway.

652
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:26,260
But till then-
- Till then what?

653
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,340
I haven’t seen her so full of life since a long time.

654
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,010
Till then... we’ll laugh a little.

655
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,010
What else?

656
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,670
Girls can't -
- I know. We can’t play Garba here.

657
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:59,080
Who wants to dance here anyway?

658
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:06,300
Come quickly the music has started.

659
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,010
Arrey, where is Jivaji?

660
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:23,620
These clothes are beautiful, dear sisters.
I'll forever be grateful to you all.

661
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:26,760
It is us who have to thank you.

662
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:29,290
Whoever has to thank whomsoever,
please do it later.

663
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:33,840
First please play the dhol.
We’re craving to dance just like the men crave for opium.

664
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:41,540
Why are you limping?

665
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,840
During yesterday’s Garba (stutters)-

666
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:52,090
Yesterday, while the men were playing Garba outside,
I slipped in the house.

667
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,510
How old is your daughter?

668
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,580
A little younger than Sita, I think

669
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:59,800
She knows how to dance?

670
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,920
Tell me one thing,

671
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,580
When we dance, why do you stand away
from us with your eyes shut?

672
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:14,220
You notice everything, no?

673
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:16,040
Yes. Tell me now.

674
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:24,430
I pray to the Goddess that
if there’s any sin in this act of dancing,

675
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:28,500
then punish me, and no one else.

676
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:33,670
Is there any more place
for a new punishment in your life, Kesar?

677
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,050
This full moon’s prayer dance is devoted to you.

678
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:44,130
Answer our prayers
or we will have to leave this village.

679
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:48,250
Forgive us for our sins
and please bless us with rains.

680
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:51,210
Bless us with rain, Goddess.

681
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,430
Bless us with rain.

682
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:59,080
I daydream about Garba even at home.

683
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:01,880
Don’t get caught in your dreams.

684
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:05,510
She won’t get caught. She prays even in her dreams.

685
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,460
This bread...

686
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,260
Where are you taking this bread?

687
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,380
It’s for me.

688
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,330
I feel very hungry these days.

689
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,760
Amba baa was saying..

690
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:35,010
What?

691
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:41,590
What was she saying?

692
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:48,090
That you tend to feel very hungry
when you’re pregnant.

693
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:50,750
Really?

694
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:51,540
Stop now...

695
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,430
I’m feeling shy!

696
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,800
Seems like he has finally hit his aim.

697
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,180
Better late than never.

698
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:54,460
Will it rain?

699
01:13:55,550 --> 01:14:00,220
It didn’t rain all monsoon. Why will it rain now?

700
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:26,790
Where could he possibly be gone?

701
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:31,080
He’ll be somewhere around here.
He’ll come back.

702
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,380
But his stuff isn’t here.

703
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:46,050
Has he gone or what?

704
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:23,960
What was his name?

705
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,590
I don’t remember.

706
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,760
Yes. But I remember his daughter's name.

707
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:29,330
Reva

708
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,080
Reva...

709
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:48,090
Reva..

710
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,290
Reva..

711
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,300
Where is she?

712
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,300
Where were you going with your stuff?

713
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,420
We can’t stay here now.

714
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,580
Yesterday, a lot of dust blew
because of the storm.

715
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:30,010
Mangla and Reva won’t be comfortable here.

716
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:35,930
How long can we stay
in the middle of this lonely desert?

717
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:42,580
It’s only when you come,
we have some company

718
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:46,580
Other than that, as you said,

719
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,420
there are only the sounds of the winds

720
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:57,920
I’ll have to find shelter in a village

721
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:02,050
There is a village

722
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:06,540
Samarpura

723
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,430
She’s right

724
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,580
The festival will start in 2 days,

725
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:21,180
and the village will need a Dholi.

726
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:23,370
You’ll get a shelter if you ask for it

727
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:28,260
Your drum stick will ask for the shelter

728
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:32,000
Just play the dhol for them once.
They won’t be able to refuse.

729
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,300
But if he plays in the village,

730
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,800
then the Garba will again become men’s privilege

731
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,800
And we’ll go back to as we were before.

732
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:44,290
But how many days
can he spend in this desert?

733
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,470
And it doesn’t matter

734
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:49,960
If not our bodies,
atleast our hearts will dance.

735
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:56,250
There is an empty house in the village.
They will give that one to you.

736
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:00,500
Your Reva will also dance inside the house?

737
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,830
Does she know how to dance?

738
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:05,830
Yes..

739
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:11,080
she danced once.

740
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:25,220
If you see her,
you won't be able to take your eyes off.

741
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:31,830
Just like lightning.

742
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,370
But that's the thing about lightning

743
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,930
It flashes,

744
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:45,180
and lights everything up in a moment,

745
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:50,800
and then there’s darkness

746
01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:20,620
(chanting prayers)

747
01:19:56,380 --> 01:20:01,010
Take this. It’s some grains

748
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,290
Don’t we give him enough already?
He will anyway take the coconut from the pyre.

749
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:10,880
It’s a tradition. Because they light  the fire,
we have to give them something.

750
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:30,430
Has it not cooled down yet?

751
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:31,500
No.

752
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:43,920
Baapu, why do they put coconuts
in the 'Holi' fire?

753
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,250
Because it’s considered holy.

754
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:46,250
Why?

755
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,830
That we wouldn’t know.

756
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:52,130
We just have to eat the coconuts
when they cool down.

757
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:57,090
But I like bread.
Why can’t we get bread out of it?

758
01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:00,680
No. We get what we put inside.

759
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:03,460
Then why can't we put bread in it?

760
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:08,510
It’s because we worship coconuts..
Bread isn’t a thing of worship.

761
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,460
You only put in what you worship.

762
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:14,870
You worship your dhol before playing it, right?
Then why don’t you put the dhol in it?

763
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,090
You mad, mad girl.

764
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:17,880
The Dhol is the means of our livelihood.

765
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,800
When we play it, we get bread as well as coconut.

766
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:26,220
And look at this,
we get such a reward as well.

767
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:30,210
So, do you mean that you get rewards
when you play the dhol?

768
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:31,330
Yes. So what?

769
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:35,010
What?

770
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,680
This is your reward.

771
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:43,680
Play the dhol now,
I want do Garba.

772
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:48,130
We can’t do Garba here.

773
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,330
Why is that?

774
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:52,710
Because we’re not considered pure,

775
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:55,380
But I’m giving you a reward.

776
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:59,800
If you don't like this doll,
I’ll sew another one for you.

777
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,510
Okay. Why don’t you
go a little to the other side?

778
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,250
And be careful.
Look out if someone is coming this side.

779
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:14,460
So are you going to….?
- Yes. I will play.

780
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:19,080
You don’t get such precious rewards everyday.

781
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:58,290
(indistinct conversation)

782
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:01,080
Where are you off to?
- To the field.

783
01:23:01,090 --> 01:23:04,220
These days wild cows
are uprooting the crops

784
01:23:04,210 --> 01:23:06,370
Be careful.
Don’t get uprooted yourself.

785
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:48,790
Come out everyone!

786
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:50,720
Arrey, come out!

787
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,300
Come out!

788
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:58,540
Mukhi Baapa!

789
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:02,170
Mukhi baapa, come out!

790
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:07,970
What happened?

791
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:12,750
Here, we’re all sleeping peacefully and there,
those lowborns are dancing and having fun around our holy fire.

792
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:14,710
What fun? What are you talking about?

793
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:21,620
That lowborn Mulji is playing the dhol
and his wife and daughter are dancing!

794
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,750
There’s nobody here.
- They must have gone home!

795
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:38,960
Then let’s go to his house.

796
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,500
He needs to be taught a lesson!

797
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:53,680
Call him outside.

798
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:57,620
Why? Do we want to call him outside
and worship that low-life?

799
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:59,840
He has disrespected our holy fire.

800
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:02,180
Let’s burn his house,
then he’ll come to know.

801
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:21,170
Reva!

802
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:31,840
Mangla!

803
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,460
Stay there!

804
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:47,630
Father!

805
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:18,870
Mangla

806
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,840
Reva..

807
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,870
Alright, enough!

808
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:03,330
What’s your name?

809
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:05,970
Mulji

810
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:07,470
Caste?

811
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,080
Lower caste

812
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:13,800
Where have you come from?

813
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:19,180
From the other side of the desert.

814
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:19,180
From the other side of the desert.

815
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:20,710
Name of the village?

816
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:24,260
Baleliya.

817
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:29,340
Give him some butter,
as a reward.

818
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:32,080
I don’t need any reward or gifts.

819
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:36,680
I need shelter.

820
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:39,090
What’s the ruckus about?

821
01:28:44,670 --> 01:28:47,460
He’s a dholi, asking for shelter.

822
01:28:49,710 --> 01:28:51,540
He needs shelter, is it?

823
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:13,960
You need shelter?

824
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:17,300
So what have you thought, Sir?

825
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,870
Yes, you’ve thought of the right thing!

826
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:24,050
The festival is in two days
and the dholis are acting very pricey anyway.

827
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:27,260
If there is already a dholi in the village,
we’ll be sorted.

828
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:28,870
But where will he stay--

829
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,300
There’s a broken house on the
outer side of the village.

830
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:35,590
And then he can get food twice a day
from Mukhi’s house.

831
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:42,670
He is the head of the village
for a reason, right?

832
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:44,710
(crowd cheering)

833
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:51,970
The house is that way.

834
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:40,010
Manjhri, Bhaglo had come.

835
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,370
He left this letter for you.

836
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:46,300
Arjan has been granted a leave
for 3 months.

837
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:48,840
He'll be back
on the last day of the festival.

838
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:52,680
Here. Have a look.

839
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:21,840
What’s with the 'daaklas' playing?

840
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:27,010
The men and cattle came back in the evening.
The news isn’t good.

841
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,330
There’s not a speck of grass
till the other side of Raapar.

842
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:33,550
We’ve called the priest to know
what the Goddess wants from us.

843
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:38,630
Because the festival starts tomorrow
and then there won’t be any scope of rain.

844
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,680
Let's see.

845
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:45,960
Come. Please come mother. Please come.

846
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,000
Has she come?

847
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
She will. She will.

848
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,080
I can see her coming.
Play the drum harder.

849
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:56,130
Play it harder!

850
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:56,840
Play!

851
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:00,300
You see her?

852
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,970
Yes! I can see.

853
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:07,330
The person whose cattle is diseased,
and who is unable to sell it off

854
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:09,760
the Goddess will possess him.

855
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:11,370
You fool!
They’re talking about you.

856
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:17,260
Hail the Goddess.

857
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:23,920
Yes yes! Play it harder.

858
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,040
Come, Let’s go and sit on that side.

859
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:29,550
But he’s been possessed by the Goddess.

860
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:34,680
The Goddess will come in Savji?
He can’t even sell a sick ox!

861
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:41,670
Come, let's go.

862
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,790
The priest is here.

863
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,340
What if the Goddess possesses somebody

864
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:53,220
and reveals our secret?

865
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:55,710
The Goddess doesn’t appear suddenly.

866
01:32:55,710 --> 01:32:57,920
She’s always around.

867
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:01,580
And if she wanted to punish us,
she would have done it directly.

868
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:04,930
Why would she need to say it through these men?

869
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:09,250
She’s our mother.

870
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,500
You know the joy that Gomti feels
when she sees her daughter Sita dance?

871
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:17,460
The Goddess must be feeling
the same joy while watching us play Garba.

872
01:33:19,130 --> 01:33:22,090
Hail the Goddess

873
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:28,080
Tell me mother!

874
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:29,260
No. no.

875
01:33:30,090 --> 01:33:31,840
Has anyone has committed a sin?

876
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,720
No!

877
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:35,800
Have the women done anything wrong?

878
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:39,750
No!

879
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:44,920
Aaahhh. Hema Malini..

880
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:49,620
'Jab tak hai Jaang' (thighs)!

881
01:33:49,630 --> 01:33:54,470
Aeh idiot! It’s not 'jaang', it’s 'jaan'.
You know what 'Jaan' means?

882
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,580
'Jaan' means?

883
01:33:55,590 --> 01:33:57,680
'Jaan' means life.
- Life!

884
01:33:57,670 --> 01:34:00,170
I got so tensed.

885
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:04,800
Basanti was dancing on pieces of glass,

886
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:08,870
And that imbecile Gabbar kept breaking glass bottles,

887
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,260
And Basanti kept dancing.

888
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:15,170
'Main naachungi, Main naachungi'.

889
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:22,000
Hey Bhagla, sing softly. The Goddess is here.

890
01:34:25,710 --> 01:34:26,870
And then Gabbar!

891
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,010
Forget about Gabbar

892
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,470
Let’s talk about Bobby first

893
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:36,540
You just said the Goddess is here,

894
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:39,840
and now again you want to talk about Bobby

895
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,430
Alright, Alright! Continue about Jabbar

896
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:49,500
Hey, it’s not Jabbar, it’s Gabbar. Isn’t it?

897
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:58,210
Show us the way, mother. Give us a solution

898
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:01,460
Can’t you think of a solution on your own, you fool

899
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:05,420
Think. Use your head a little

900
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:07,870
Have they made you the head of the village for nothing?

901
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:10,090
(crowd cheering)

902
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:15,290
Three bullets and three people and then-

903
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:24,130
These fools have already collapsed.

904
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:29,880
Hail the Goddess!

905
01:35:31,630 --> 01:35:34,550
I told you right?
Bhaglo won’t tell anyone.

906
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:38,430
The Goddess blesses certain men
with compassionate souls.

907
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:40,790
That’s how the world sustains itself.

908
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:44,970
What did the priest say yesterday?

909
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,960
Why? Were you sleeping then?

910
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,460
Yes. I put some earbuds on.

911
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:53,290
I slept peacefully thinking that
our dholi is staying in the village.

912
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:55,720
I’m irritated by that thought.

913
01:35:55,710 --> 01:35:57,710
We were joyously dancing till now.

914
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:01,920
Now again the men will dance
and we’ll just fetch water.

915
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,620
The priest said that the men
will have to leave the village.

916
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:06,720
It’ll be just us and the kids then.

917
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:08,330
Have you lost your mind?

918
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:11,260
All the oldies are going to sit
and watch us closely.

919
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:14,500
You’re thinking that we’ll all dance around the village?

920
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:17,370
No garba anymore.

921
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:36,220
I’ll be here every morning.

922
01:36:36,210 --> 01:36:41,370
You women come first, then the village.

923
01:36:50,520 --> 01:37:00,690
The one whose playfulness tantalizes my mind

924
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:10,970
The one whose drum beats make
me strike like a flash in the sky

925
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:15,010
The one whose playfulness tantalizes my mind

926
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:19,230
The one whose drum beats make
me strike like a flash in the sky

927
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:29,220
Oh here comes the one who rides the stallion of life

928
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:33,680
I become the sand to his dunes

929
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:37,640
I sway and dance to his tunes

930
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:22,400
He shattered the silences in my life

931
01:38:22,390 --> 01:38:26,180
He planted a tree of hope
in the desert of my loneliness

932
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:38,680
He shattered the silences in my life

933
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:38,680
He shattered the silences in my life

934
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:42,510
He planted a tree of hope
in the desert of my loneliness

935
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:45,650
He dished out the dreams that I devoured

936
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:54,510
Oh here comes the one who rides the stallion of life

937
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:59,270
I become the sand to his dunes

938
01:38:59,270 --> 01:39:03,480
I sway and dance to his tunes

939
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:07,720
I become the sand to his dunes

940
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:11,390
I sway and dance to his tunes

941
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:43,600
He broke my unmoving stride

942
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:48,270
He tricked me as per my desire

943
01:39:55,430 --> 01:39:59,720
He broke my unmoving stride

944
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:06,800
I become the trail that he treads

945
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:15,690
Oh here comes the one who rides the stallion of life

946
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:20,760
I become the sand to his dunes

947
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:37,440
I sway and dance to his tunes

948
01:40:56,210 --> 01:40:57,710
Where is Ganga?

949
01:40:57,710 --> 01:40:59,250
Someone has come to visit her.

950
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:00,830
I saw a cart coming.

951
01:41:07,210 --> 01:41:11,250
Ganga. Your cousin is here.

952
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:23,970
Brother! How are you here
so early in the morning?

953
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:30,500
Sister, your father and brother
were working in the field,

954
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,760
and suddenly the lightning struck.
Both of them are dead.

955
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:55,550
Come sister. Come quickly.

956
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,970
We need to perform the last rites!

957
01:42:06,090 --> 01:42:07,880
Don't cry.

958
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:14,500
Go with your brother.

959
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:35,330
Please forgive me!
Don't punish us, mother..

960
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:37,380
What happened?

961
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:41,620
Please take care of everyone.

962
01:42:41,630 --> 01:42:44,050
You don't worry about all that.

963
01:42:44,050 --> 01:42:46,090
I feel worried.

964
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:49,090
Worried for my kids and my husband.

965
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:53,130
What if something happens to them?
- Why are you saying all this?

966
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:58,630
The Goddess is upset.
She is punishing us for our sins.

967
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:00,090
What sins?

968
01:45:18,090 --> 01:45:25,390
I’d asked you to cut your
wings and horns yourself

969
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:27,880
Now it will hurt more when I cut them.

970
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:53,050
Cut his hands first!

971
01:45:53,050 --> 01:45:55,640
He has made our women dance
to his beats with these hands.

972
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:17,670
Wait!
- There is nothing to wait in this.

973
01:46:17,670 --> 01:46:21,380
Cut his head and finish the matter.

974
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:30,180
The punishment for his sin is death
and that, he will get.

975
01:46:31,170 --> 01:46:32,710
But not now.

976
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:39,420
It’s the last day of the festival.
We’ll offer him as sacrifice tonight.

977
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:41,380
What do we do with this low-life till then?

978
01:46:41,380 --> 01:46:44,040
Tie him here in the centre.

979
01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:47,260
Let him rot in the heat all day.

980
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:50,760
We’ll kill him after the prayer tonight.

981
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:54,880
Call another dholi for the night.

982
01:48:10,090 --> 01:48:12,930
What are you looking at?

983
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:25,430
He will be sacrificed tonight.

985
01:50:38,210 --> 01:50:40,210
Hail the Goddess!

986
01:50:40,210 --> 01:50:41,830
Wait!

987
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:50,040
We have got to ask him his last wish.

988
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:55,590
Otherwise, his spirit will wander in the village.

989
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:57,590
We don’t need to ask for his last wish.

990
01:50:59,210 --> 01:51:03,540
Speak.
What is your last wish?

991
01:51:11,010 --> 01:51:16,680
Burn me alive.

992
01:51:11,010 --> 01:51:16,680
Burn me alive.

993
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:21,130
And...
- Only one wish.

994
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:23,080
Let him speak.

995
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:26,890
Speak.

996
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:33,500
Let me play the dhol for one last time.

997
01:51:33,510 --> 01:51:35,970
I will play until the leather tears off.

998
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:40,920
Once it tears, burn me.

999
01:51:42,670 --> 01:51:44,330
Okay then.

1000
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:48,040
We would have had to burn him anyway,
after killing him.

1001
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:04,830
Go inside!

1002
01:53:12,010 --> 01:53:13,590
I said, go inside!

1003
01:53:14,140 --> 01:53:19,970
I have crossed the boundaries
and overcome the obstacles

1004
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:26,190
I have traversed the mountain
of hardships given by you

1005
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:38,050
I have let go of your insults and abuse

1006
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:43,860
And done away with my deepest fears

1007
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:01,670
Nobody will move.

1008
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:11,430
The Goddess has made her presence felt today.

1009
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:14,170
Everybody bow down to her.

1010
01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:34,430
I have left all of this behind to reach far

1011
01:54:34,430 --> 01:54:53,180
To the shade of my heart’s desire

1012
01:55:09,230 --> 01:55:12,440
I have crossed the boundaries

1013
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:25,110
I have crossed the boundaries
and overcome the obstacles

1014
01:55:25,100 --> 01:55:28,300
I have traversed the mountain
of hardships given by you

1015
01:55:28,310 --> 01:55:31,480
And done away with my deepest fears

1016
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:35,980
I have left all of this behind to reach far

1017
01:55:40,850 --> 01:55:50,890
To the shade of my heart’s desire

1018
01:55:57,230 --> 01:56:00,610
I have crossed all thresholds

1019
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:13,190
And broken through the traps that you laid

1020
01:56:13,180 --> 01:56:19,510
I have grown beyond the worldly bounds
of names and belongings

1021
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:24,060
I have left all of it to reach far

1022
01:56:28,730 --> 01:56:37,770
To the shade of my heart’s desire

1023
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,470
Dance, my dear Reva,

1024
01:56:40,130 --> 01:56:41,130
Dance.

1025
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:45,170
It’s your turn now.

1026
01:56:44,890 --> 01:56:48,430
I refuse to accept your tyranny anymore

1027
01:56:54,640 --> 01:57:01,100
My anklets have now broken their silence

1028
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:04,180
As my dreams have been freed from shackles

1029
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:07,550
My desert now aspires for the rains

1030
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:16,980
I have crossed the desert to reach the far end

1031
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:26,770
To the shade of my heart’s desire
