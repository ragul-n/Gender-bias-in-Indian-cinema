1
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:08,433
Then.

2
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:12,433
Then?

3
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:14,700
Then.

4
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,836
What happened then? Didn't
you ask her name?

5
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,101
My father the Great Jayanth Rao..

6
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,301
..did he ask your name in
the first meeting, mummy?

7
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,333
Your father's story
is totally different.

8
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:32,700
What must be so great in it?

9
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,702
Your father directly proposed
me saying 'l Love you'.

10
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,167
And did you agree instantly?

11
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,367
Yes without a second
thought l agreed.

12
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:41,302
Oh! God! There! You have
done the grave mistake.

13
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,434
You do not have any taste, mummy.

14
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:44,700
He must have just tried
to flirt with you.

15
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:46,367
Did you really have to agree?

16
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,170
Will any sensible person marry
such a foolish man, mother?

17
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,300
You Donkey!

18
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:55,368
Kamala, tell him if he touches my
car once again l will not keep quiet.

19
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,501
Now, what has gone wrong that
you are shouting like this?

20
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,167
The whole street is stinking.

21
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:02,702
Ask him from which gutter he had
come out and had driven my car?

22
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,568
At his age l could not
afford even a cycle.

23
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:08,035
And he wants a car worth 95
Iakhs to roam in the streets.

24
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,401
l have 15 offices. Fifteen!

25
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:12,768
Ask your son whether he knows the
address of at least one office.

26
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,368
He can wander in the streets but
cannot come to the office.

27
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:19,303
Just because his father is there
to earn money. He is very calm.

28
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,700
Did you see his 12th standard
marks sheet, Kamala?

29
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:23,634
His marks are like the
telephone numbers.

30
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,034
2, 1 , O, 5. Even after
appearing three times..

31
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,569
..for the exams he does
not have the fortune to pass.

32
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:35,237
The juice is over. Now feed him
warm milk in a feeding bottle.

33
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,634
Let him drink, poor baby.

34
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,568
Mother! Ask him for the opener.

35
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:52,302
Kamala, from tomorrow he
should be in the office.

36
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:53,433
Otherwise l will not keep quiet.

37
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:57,035
Give that. You are not short
of these types of traits.

38
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,368
Still not matured in life.

39
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:01,167
And you try to threaten holding
a bottle in hand. Bottle!

40
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:02,500
lf l had not done that much.

41
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:04,034
You husband would have been still
standing and screaming here.

42
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,501
When will he realize
that l have grown up?

43
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,567
Then what happened to your story?

44
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:09,700
Which story?

45
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,968
That girl's, who helped
you out of the gutter.

46
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,268
Oh! That story!
- My car is fully spoiled.

47
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,467
Coming.

48
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,500
Hey! What are you looking? Wash it.

49
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:01,102
l liked that watch very much
and now l have lost it.

50
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,167
Will you please see if you
have one more piece?

51
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,101
No Madam, l would have surely
given if l had an extra piece.

52
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:07,100
Okay, thank you.

53
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,334
May l help you?

54
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,902
Yes. You should help. Am
sure God will bless you.

55
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,301
l am searching for a girl.

56
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,434
What? A girl?

57
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:26,901
This girl l am searching had
purchased this watch..

58
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,901
..from your shop and
the bill is here.

59
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,033
Who is this girl?

60
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,503
Tell me if you know her name, her
caste, her community or her address.

61
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,435
And if at all l meet her l will see
that she never forgets me.

62
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:38,434
l think l have l fallen slightly
in love with her.

63
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,968
Sorry sir, thousands
of people come here.

64
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:41,100
l do not know whom you
are talking about.

65
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,901
You have not helped me in
anyway for me to thank you.

66
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,034
And l doubt you will be blessed.

67
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,902
98.3 FM.

68
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:49,370
You are listening to your favorite
radio station, Radio Mirchi, 98.3.

69
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:53,503
lt is Hot! You call to hear
your songs to 989801 .

70
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:55,434

00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,236
l, Ratna Srivatsav am
waiting your call.

72
00:09:58,266 --> 00:09:59,967
Now, let us see who
is our next caller.

73
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,134
Hello! Who is on the line?

74
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,834
What is in the name?

75
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:04,367
Just listen to my story
and help me out.

76
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:05,500
l am in a great trouble.

77
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:07,501
Tell me your problem. We
will solve it instantly.

78
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,301
l saw a girl, today.

79
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:14,036
And just looking at her l lost my
body balance and fell into a gutter.

80
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,101
Hey! Listen to that.
- Oh! My God! And then?

81
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,233
Maybe l would have anyhow survived..

82
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:18,434
..if l have seen her
and walked away.

83
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:20,434
But, she helped me
and saved my life.

84
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:23,168
From that moment l have
Iost my sanity.

85
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:25,100
Tell me where did this happen?

86
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,368
There is mall in M. G. Road
meant only for girls.

87
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,100
ln the drainage opposite to that.

88
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:30,834
What an odor it was?

89
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:33,168
Okay, okay. What should we do now?

90
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:37,437
Nothing. Just tell that great soul
to come near this great gutter.

91
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,902
l will be waiting here. - Okay.

92
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,835
Tell her this Pritam can
wait all his life..

93
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,901
..with the watch she left behind.

94
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:47,834
Okay. Okay. And if she is
listening to this program.

95
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,101
She will surely come, Pritam.

96
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,433
You do not worry. Okay?

97
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,236
l hope so. As you always give this
answer to people who call you.

98
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:55,567
Forget that. Play a song
for that girl, now.

99
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,168
Okay. The girl who has helped
Pritam out of the gutter.

100
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:01,034
Please go near the spot.

101
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,035
Please meet him. All
the best, Pritam.

102
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,769
A beautiful track for Pritam's
Iove and confusion.

103
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:35,903
''Once, only once come
in front of me.''

104
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:40,103
''Once, only once come
in front of me.''

105
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:44,436
''l have filled you in
my eyes and soul.''

106
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,768
''l had bought you from you.''

107
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:50,970
''lt's your image that

108
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,302
''You are in me and my senses.''

109
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:58,237
''Once, only once
come in front of me.''

110
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,236
''From your one appearance.''

111
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:43,703
''From your one appearance.''

112
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:48,004
''You adorned my life.''

113
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,904
''You are spread in
my body and soul.''

114
00:12:57,366 --> 00:13:01,369
''Once, only once come

00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:16,636
''lt's your image that

119
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:18,634
''You are in me and my senses.''

120
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:23,637
''Once, only once
come in front of me.''

121
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,103
''The instant l saw your smile.''

122
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,569
''The instant l saw your smile.''

123
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:17,837
''Felt like basking.''

124
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:22,771
''ln the moonlight at day.''

125
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,304
''Once, only once

126
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:35,703
''Once, only once

127
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:40,103
''l have filled you in

''lt's your image that
fills my imagination.''

130
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,568
''You are in me and my senses.''

131
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:54,572
''Once, only once
come in front of me.''

132
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:06,967
Hey! Get up from there! - Give way!

133
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,901
Hey! Get up from there!

134
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:11,768
Give way!
- Hey! Mister Get up from there.

135
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,234
Hello! - Hello, Sir.

136
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,567
Hello!
- Why are you here, sir?

137
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,501
Because l am this fool's father.

138
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:17,633
ls it, sir?

139
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:25,035
Do not disgrace me in the public,
sir. Stand up, sir.

140
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,503
Sir, you have still not matured
to look out for a girl.

141
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,101
We are there to do that job.

142
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,036
Now, get up, sir. Get up,
sir. Hey! Get up!

143
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,700
Take him along with you.

144
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,767
Come soon.

145
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,167
Hey, let go of me.

146
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,968
Oh! Leave my hand. Stand properly.

147
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:58,902
Let me see. Oh! He has already left.

148
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:00,701
Are you mad? Let us go.

149
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:03,434
ln the morning that fool's face
was covered with filth..

150
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:05,467
..and l could not see his face.

151
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:07,634
Now, at least we could
see his face from far.

152
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,733
Forget, let us at least see his car.
Come.

153
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,867
Will you come with me? Or
should l go from here?

154
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:11,167
Please!
- Come!

155
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:24,837
My handsome son! See
who the girl is.

156
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,701
Tomorrow he is coming
with me to Madikeri.

157
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:33,901
l will ask him about the girl.

158
00:16:33,966 --> 00:16:35,434
Till then have some patience.

159
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:38,468
l heard it is raining
heavily in Madikeri.

160
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:42,436
Be careful that your son
does not fall sick.

161
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:47,704
Tell Colonel that l am sorry
that l could make it there.

162
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,868
What is it mother that makes
you look so happy?

163
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,634
Did father talk about divorce?

164
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,436
No Pritu, but can l cry
hearing your story?

165
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:24,769
Son is grown up. Is in
Iove? Likes a girl.

166
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:25,900
Not bothered of searching
for the girl.

167
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:27,367
Get him married and play
with grandchildren..

168
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:28,901
..and see the generation grow.

169
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,368
No one is taking any responsibility.

170
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:33,901
Forget that. Will l meet
that girl again, mummy?

171
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,368
lf it is written in your destiny.

172
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:37,634
You will surely meet her.
- Destiny?

173
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,569
lf just talking about my destiny
the car can break down.

174
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,868
l do not know with what
Iuck l am born?

175
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,034
l am sure l will not meet that girl.

176
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:53,500
When your father said
l Love you to me.

177
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:56,502
The city bus we were traveling met
with an accident and fell down.

178
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:58,301
This is not very great incident
compared to that.

179
00:17:58,366 --> 00:17:59,767
First, go and change the wheel.

180
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,301
Marrying father is your
biggest accident.

181
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:04,834
l do not know what else l have
to do with these hands.

182
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,367
Forget them, Pritu. Pritu!

183
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:30,700
Catch!

184
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,767
Give the kerchief, sir.

185
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,969
What kerchief? Why?

186
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:46,036
Do you know Nandini? How?

187
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:48,300
This is for the first time
l am coming across..

188
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:50,901
..a person speaking
so perfect Kannada.

189
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,501
Hello! Give me the kerchief, sir.

190
00:19:57,433 --> 00:20:00,836
Heavy rains. Is falling.
Chilly weather.

191
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,435
And it hurts very much if beaten.

192
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:06,368
You are still a child.
Mama's boy. Go!

193
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:11,704
Sir, you tell me whether to
Iaugh or cry looking at you.

194
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:13,300
That kerchief.

195
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:15,234
You stupid!

196
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:26,433
Hey!

197
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:22,035
Who is Mama's boy, now?

198
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:26,768
Mother India looks ready to beat me.

199
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:29,301
Oh! God! What has happened to you?

200
00:23:29,766 --> 00:23:31,234
Mom, l met that girl again.

201
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:34,235
Went searching and just missed her.

202
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:37,102
My fate. You just shut your
mouth and come with me.

203
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,434
lt is raining heavily,
come inside, Pritu.

204
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,269
You ladies are meeting
after many years.

205
00:23:51,366 --> 00:23:54,469
And if you do not talk nonstop
it is an insult to womanhood.

206
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:57,634
When you both embrace each
other and shed tears.

207
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,368
What should l do standing
there, mummy?

208
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:01,968
Pritu, listen to me.

209
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:06,567
What s heavy
rain it is in your area, Babli?

210
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:10,569
Oh! You look just the same.
Not changed a bit.

211
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:12,167
And you are not less.

212
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:13,634
You look healthy and strong.

213
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:15,433
Where has your son gone?

214
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,301
Gone to look around. He will come.

215
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:22,167
Show me that.

216
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:30,436
No, that does not suit your face.

217
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,101
Pack this.
- Yes, ma'am.

218
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:34,901
You look so beautiful and..

219
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,235
..l did not think that you
would have such dull taste.

220
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:39,101
Could you please mind
your own business?

221
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,233
Why do you want all this?

222
00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:44,302
Sir, will you please give some
oil or mud to smear on my face.

223
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,635
lf my face is clean people
do not recognize me.

224
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,233
What do you tell?

225
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:50,433
Nonsense!

226
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:55,369
Do you know who are
Pritam and Nandini?

227
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:57,434
That is the name of
our grandchildren.

228
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,834
lf it is a grandson then it
will be my name Pritam and..

229
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,569
..if it is a granddaughter then
it is your name Nandini.

230
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,167
Are two grandchildren enough?

231
00:26:04,266 --> 00:26:05,367
Who the hell are you?

232
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:09,535
l am the same fool who fell into
the gutter looking at you.

233
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,036
These two things are the witness
for the condition l am.

234
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:20,237
Oh! My God! Oh! My God!
That! Was that you?

235
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:24,968
FM song. Oil on the face.

236
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,568
l never thought l would meet you.

237
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:30,301
Even l never thought.
What luck it is!

238
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:33,969
lf any one meets unconsciously
off and on.

239
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:35,433
They are destined to
marry each other.

240
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,836
What?
- Yes. We should not delay in love.

241
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,834
The climate and monsoon is super.

242
00:26:44,966 --> 00:26:46,033
Are you from Bangalore?

243
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:48,435
Yes. My Father's name is Jaywant.

244
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,100
Has made lot of properties.

245
00:26:50,366 --> 00:26:52,835
Only son. My mother is very good.

246
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,967
Always tells that she is ready to..

247
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:55,434
..give her life for the
future daughter-in-law.

248
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:59,303
ln all l have a great
family background.

249
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:00,433
Hey! Listen! Listen!

250
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,034
Look, l do not want your
family background.

251
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:04,034
You are very beautiful
and that is enough.

252
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:06,769
lf you have any problem l can
get adjusted sincerely..

253
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,367
..and lead a good life with you.

254
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,102
Do you know any good
mental hospital?

255
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,800
lt is like a mother's house to me.

256
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:14,267
But l have not been there
since long as l was busy.

257
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,768
Please take some time off your
work and go there to scan..

258
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,902
..whether you have a brain
inside your head or not.

259
00:27:20,033 --> 00:27:21,501
And if you talk like a
Ioose character here.

260
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:23,434
You will be thrashed
to death. Got it?

261
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:31,370
Listen! l will never
search for you again.

262
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:37,171
And if at all l meet you by
Iuck, l will marry you.

263
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:04,902
''First shower! What is your magic.''

264
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:08,703
''Of your raindrops.''

265
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:12,235
''The line of clouds in the sky.''

266
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,936
''Like the wreath of love.''

267
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:19,703
''ln the shower of rain.''

268
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:23,102
''Love has blossomed.''

269
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:27,169
''ln which shell the water drop.''

270
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:30,769
''Has turned into a pearl.''

271
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:34,436
''Which seedling will grow.''

272
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,702
''Cannot comprehend.''

273
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:43,238
''Dear, l was waiting for you..

274
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:46,169
..but you betrayed me.''

275
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:50,236
Hello! Excuse me! Will you
please pull that rope?

276
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:52,334
What is this Boss?

277
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,302
l am in a mood to sing and you are
telling me to pull the rope.

278
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,368
How could you show me
the rope at this age?

279
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:03,834
l do not know what else l have
to do with this hand.

280
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:10,970
Very Bad! Lift it! Lift it!

281
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:12,768
Look if anything is wrong with him.

282
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:15,101
He looks fine.
- Nothing is wrong with him.

283
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:16,700
He has got a good physique.

284
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,169
Babli, he is my son, Pritam.

285
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,701
Do you remember, Pritu?

286
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,837
When you came to Delhi
with you parents.

287
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,170
l tried to bathe you how you
thumped on my head with the mug.

288
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,169
He was a kid then. How
can he remember that?

289
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:52,701
That is true. Oh! Yes!

290
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:55,768
You never used to wear
your shorts as a kid.

291
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,034
Look, how he has grown up now.

292
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:05,368
Pritu, she is my daughter, Nandini.

293
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:07,367
Hey!

294
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,101
l am so sorry! So sorry!

295
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,633
lt is okay. It is all right, come.
No problem as it's you..

296
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,369
..who saw me in this
state of undress.

297
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:31,967
Take the coffee.

298
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:36,036
Let us drink. So, at last
we meet again. Sit down.

299
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,233
Let us exchange a few words
like civilized people.

300
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,035
Take your watch. And l know
that you are having my watch.

301
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:41,233
So please return it.

302
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:45,669
ls this any exchange offer?
l will not return your watch.

303
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,967
What do they call it?

304
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:48,901
Yes! It is like a token of love.

305
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:51,368
So? You will not return my watch.

306
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,636
Listen, in spite of being so verbal
in my feelings about love.

307
00:30:57,966 --> 00:31:00,835
Try to show some mercy on me.

308
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:03,101
l know how to take
my watch from you.

309
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:06,268
Oh! l say it is really difficult.

310
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:08,267
lt is very difficult
to win over a girl.

311
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,968
Oh! Listen! This is
really an injustice.

312
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:15,100
You are embarrassing me.

313
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:17,568
At morning in the market you
were giving big talks..

314
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:18,967
..that you will do this and that.

315
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:21,568
l even remember you telling
that you will bind me..

316
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:23,835
..the matrimonial thread
if you meet me again.

317
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:26,768
So! At last you have
come to the point.

318
00:31:26,966 --> 00:31:30,102
Listen, you sit down and let
us decide the matter coolly.

319
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,602
lt is not me who ought to
decide this. But my father.

320
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:37,302
You take his consent and
then l will be ready.

321
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,267
You mean my father-in-law?

322
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,033
Tell me where is my father-in-law?

323
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,835
l thought l am very fast.
But you are faster than me.

324
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,234
How many times to tell you?

325
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,967
Tell me how many times
should l tell you.

326
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:01,100
Were you'll waiting for the donkeys?

327
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:04,235
Why can't you water
the garden daily?

328
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,034
The motor broke down, sir.

329
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,701
What if it rains? Hold the umbrella
and water the plants.

330
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:09,934
Should l put some ice, sir?

331
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:13,502
Next time if l see the withered
flowers in the garden..

332
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,501
..l will shoot all of
you. Get out! Go!

333
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:16,633
Okay, sir.

334
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,903
Come on! Come on! Matter is
serious. Water the whole garden.

335
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:27,907
Yes. l get angry when there is
no discipline and goal in life.

336
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:32,770
When a person is not adventurous
l cannot tolerate him.

337
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:34,901
l just ignore him
and drive him away.

338
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:36,634
l am also little bit
like you, uncle.

339
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,234
Discipline is important to me.

340
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:43,703
When the President was felicitating
me with bravery award.

341
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:46,735
His shirt button had come off.

342
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:51,503
l told him that his button is open
before receiving the award.

343
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:53,234
Poor fellow had to button it up
and then hand over the award.

344
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:54,967
By then the media wrote
about the Colonel.

345
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:58,035
Subaiyya is mad, eccentric.
But l did not give a damn.

346
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,101
Will you please stop
biting your nail.

347
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,569
Whisky? Is beer okay, then?

348
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:11,503
What is this, Uncle? What is
your age and what is mine.

349
00:33:11,966 --> 00:33:14,168
Being elder to me how could
you encourage me to drink?

350
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:16,567
l am a decent guy.

351
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:19,035
You don't want it?
Okay. That is good.

352
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:20,434
A person should be like that.

353
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:24,169
Should speak out the mind not
act. l like such people.

354
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:27,969
So? Do you like me, uncle?

355
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:34,035
You are really great.

356
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,835
You liked me instantly.

357
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,436
ln case if l tell you that l would
like to marry your daughter,..

358
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,835
..l am sure you would not slap me.

359
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,034
lsn't it, Uncle?

360
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:49,067
Yes, not a problem.

361
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:53,835
l feel you have become too great.

362
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,367
l think somewhere
there is a problem.

363
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:58,401
But l can't detect where
is the problem lies.

364
00:33:59,966 --> 00:34:01,033
Nandu!

365
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,567
Father!

366
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:17,104
l am sorry. You know before l
got retired from my service.

367
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,501
There was a bomb blast
just close to me.

368
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,568
And l lost my hearing ability.

369
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:24,602
Now, without these hearing aids
l cannot hear anything.

370
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:32,770
Sir, do l have to repeat everything
from the beginning.

371
00:34:33,566 --> 00:34:34,967
Yes, tell me.

372
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,635
He is our Kamala daughter's son.

373
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:39,634
What?
- Yes.

374
00:34:39,966 --> 00:34:41,434
Kamala daughter's?
- Yes.

375
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:44,969
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

376
00:34:46,966 --> 00:34:49,702
Young man, you have
a fabulous mother.

377
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,967
Come on.

378
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:52,367
Year's back it was your mother
who got Babli and..

379
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:53,834
..me married.

380
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,301
Today, she has come a
week early to attend..

381
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:58,034
..my daughter's marriage.

382
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,035
What did you say? Marriage?

383
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:07,769
Yes. My daughter Nandini's wedding.

384
00:35:12,566 --> 00:35:14,301
After coming here to attend
Nandini's marriage..

385
00:35:14,366 --> 00:35:16,034
..he is asking whose marriage it is.

386
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:17,900
Didn't you tell him that?

387
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,902
He does not like attending
marriage functions.

388
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,834
Babli, when l ask him to accompany
me to any marriage.

389
00:35:22,966 --> 00:35:24,500
He always refuses. So l brought
him along without informing him.

390
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:26,501
You mother and son duo are perfect.

391
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:28,734
Now, enough of drinking.
- Okay.

392
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:30,034
Come let us go for dinner.

393
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:32,301
Come on! Young man!

394
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:33,800
Please, come.

395
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:37,867
Hello, Mummy!

396
00:36:37,966 --> 00:36:39,934
Hello Pritu, where are you?

397
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:41,467
Sorry mother, l am going back.

398
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,968
You promised to be here for a week.

399
00:36:44,233 --> 00:36:46,301
l am sorry, mummy. You are done with
the marriage program.

400
00:36:46,366 --> 00:36:47,433
l will come to take
you back after that.

401
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,702
Pritu!
- Aunt, can l talk?

402
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,301
Pritu, Nandini wants
to speak to you.

403
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:58,803
Hi! Handsome! How are you?
Isn't the monsoon super?

404
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:04,705
Look, l am sorry. l did not know
that you were getting married.

405
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,902
And If l have hurt your feelings.
Please do forgive me.

406
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,901
l had high opinion for you.

407
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:13,601
But did not know that you would
act like a frightened kitten.

408
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:18,302
You told if we meet again
you would surely marry me.

409
00:37:19,766 --> 00:37:21,167
And when l have started
thinking that if at all..

410
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:23,301
..l would marry l should
marry a man like you.

411
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,767
You left the arena and ran away.

412
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,903
l am waiting here with my bag
packed to elope with you any moment.

413
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,637
But nothing like that materialized.
l will be waiting for you.

414
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:37,634
Come and take me with you.

415
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:40,569
After selecting the names
of our grandchildren.

416
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,367
How could you run away like this?

417
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,201
lsn't what you are doing a
shame to the whole mankind?

418
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:51,903
Hello! Hello! Hello!

419
00:38:46,433 --> 00:38:48,301
He says she held his hand
and helped him out.

420
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:53,503
Listen, just because the girl
held his hand he got a shock

421
00:38:58,166 --> 00:39:01,569
..he would have got died
of short circuit there.

422
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:08,503
Young man, if you love somebody
try to attain her not lose her.

423
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:13,103
Tell me who she is. l do not
mind kidnapping her and..

424
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:15,501
..getting her married to you.

425
00:39:15,766 --> 00:39:16,833
Do you mean it, uncle?

426
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:18,300
Definitely.

427
00:39:18,366 --> 00:39:20,101
Uncle, your words are enough for me.

428
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,567
Let your blessings
always be with me.

429
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:25,102
l will immediately tie this
watch on that girl's hand.

430
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:27,802
lf l do that now, it will
be easy when l wed her.

431
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:29,434
Go ahead.
- l will, Uncle.

432
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:31,768
You were left to support him.

433
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:36,103
Uncle, if you support me. l
promise on her father and..

434
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,367
..mother l will not abandon her.

435
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,300
What do you say, aunt Babli?

436
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:41,101
You have our full support
your uncle's and mine in..

437
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:42,567
..whatever you do.

438
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:45,502
Thank you, Aunt. Aunt, you are
really too good than Uncle.

439
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:47,100
Let me have your blessings also.

440
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:51,703
l thought of giving that girl's
and my name to our grandchildren.

441
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:55,102
But now l have decided
to name them as..

442
00:39:56,633 --> 00:39:58,034
But l need your support
like this from the day..

443
00:39:58,066 --> 00:40:00,034
..l make the girl elope with me.

444
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:02,034
To the day of christening
of my grandchildren.

445
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,168
And if you ever give
up your support..

446
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:12,173
..l will surely become
like this Devdas.

447
00:40:12,633 --> 00:40:16,770
Devdas? This Hare?
Wonderful comedy!

448
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:20,036
This is not a comedy, Uncle.
But a big tragedy.

449
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,771
This Devdas had an affair with a
beautiful elephant in the forest.

450
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:28,569
They were head over heels
in love with each other.

451
00:40:28,633 --> 00:40:31,035
When they were about to exchange
the marriage vows.

452
00:40:31,066 --> 00:40:35,370
An ant came by and the elephant
eloped with him and got married.

453
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:36,767
They even have three children now.

454
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,439
With that tragedy he became
heartbroken and started drinking.

455
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:46,569
He was on the road playing. Seeing
him l carried him home.

456
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:50,503
Sir! Sir! Sir! It is
swollen all over.

457
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:52,768
There is bandage on the head.
You should see that.

458
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:57,703
Babli, ask him to tell the matter
clearly. Or else l will shoot him.

459
00:40:58,033 --> 00:40:59,434
Who has been bandaged?

460
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,567
Everyone.

461
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:01,700
Everyone means whom?

462
00:41:01,966 --> 00:41:03,000
Jolly, sir.

463
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,067
Jolly?

464
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:07,968
Yes sir. People are talking
of the fight this sir and..

465
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,369
..Jolly had on the highway.

466
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,702
Sir! Sir!

467
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:21,167
Keep quiet.
- No one is there.

468
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:24,235
Jolly! You rascal come out.

469
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:27,235
Who is this Jolly?
What is happening?

470
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:30,368
He is a local. Ran away
from the military.

471
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:33,702
He is harassing Nandini by
writing her love letters.

472
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:41,403
He says he will not let
Nandini marry anyone.

473
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:43,968
And if she marries any one
he has threatened to kill..

474
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:45,234
..the man and will go to the jail.

475
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,302
Sir! Sir! There is no one
in. Come sir. Come sir.

476
00:41:48,366 --> 00:41:50,367
Leave me!
- Sir! Sir!

477
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:51,634
Leave! Who are you to stop me?

478
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:53,234
There is no one in.
Come sir. Come sir.

479
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,167
He survived today. If he
comes here let me know.

480
00:41:57,233 --> 00:41:59,435
l will kill him.
- Yes Sir.

481
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,171
Devdas, the old man is quiet
only on the surface.

482
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,368
He can even murder anyone
if violence is provoked.

483
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:09,936
We have to be very careful in future.
Come let us go.

484
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:21,170
''Keep my heart with care.''

485
00:42:28,566 --> 00:42:29,633
What is this?

486
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:33,902
lt was raining very heavily
and l was feeling very cold.

487
00:42:33,966 --> 00:42:36,501
Actually this is not the age to
fall sound asleep in this season.

488
00:42:36,966 --> 00:42:38,367
So l came out for a round.

489
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,435
Actually l wanted to deeply discuss
about our eloping from here.

490
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,534
Are you free?

491
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:44,634
Look, l was simply joking with you.
So do not take anything seriously.

492
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,970
How can l forget that? Who started
this drama? You or me?

493
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,167
l was going on my way.
You called me.

494
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,902
l came back. Just because
you tell me to forget it.

495
00:42:53,966 --> 00:42:56,368
How can l spend the loneliness
in this monsoon?

496
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,967
l find it very difficult.

497
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:00,969
Look, l do not know anything.
l will tie this sari here.

498
00:43:01,366 --> 00:43:03,301
And when you feel like
eloping with me.

499
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,302
Come down the sari in a filmi style.

500
00:43:08,433 --> 00:43:10,968
l will be waiting down in my car.
We will run away from here.

501
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:13,368
Tomorrow we should not face any
problems at the last moment.

502
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:15,034
So, l am doing all the
preparations, today.

503
00:43:15,966 --> 00:43:17,567
Why don't you do a trial now?

504
00:43:18,266 --> 00:43:19,834
Do you know the extent
of my father anger?

505
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:21,333
You should not talk about great..

506
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:22,901
..people like him
at this time of night.

507
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,435
l have great respect to the man who
is going to be my father-in-law.

508
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,568
lf you behave foolishly like this.
l will go and tell him.

509
00:43:27,866 --> 00:43:30,101
And you will have to bear
the consequences.

510
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:32,835
You are trying to
frighten me. Listen..

511
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,568
..l will take care of your father.

512
00:43:35,433 --> 00:43:38,569
You decide about our eloping. Okay?

513
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,434
Now go and have a good

Rama! Rama! Where is Pritam?

00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,034
He is gone with Master
to the fields.

522
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:38,501
Master had gun in his hands.

523
00:44:55,733 --> 00:44:57,434
Father! Father! Father!

524
00:45:05,766 --> 00:45:09,703
Hi! Uncle! Fire!

some other place. Oh! God!

528
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,301
Father, are you not in your senses.

529
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:35,767
Early in the morning
you are playing.

530
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:36,900
Don't you have any other work to do?

531
00:45:36,966 --> 00:45:39,702
He is such a brave young man.
l always thought of making ..

532
00:45:39,766 --> 00:45:43,302
..brave man like him hold a target
while l could do the shooting.

533
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:44,433
No one dared to stand.

534
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:47,702
They would either run or fall
down. He is only real man..

535
00:45:47,766 --> 00:45:48,967
..l met so far. A real man.

536
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,434
He should have been
in the army.

537
00:45:57,633 --> 00:45:58,700
Nandini!

538
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,271
Young man! Young man!

539
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,967
Young man!

540
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:20,835
Why did you come running? Did
you fear that l would die?

541
00:46:21,633 --> 00:46:22,700
Young man!

542
00:46:22,766 --> 00:46:23,833
Let go of my hands.

543
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,636
Did you come to save me?
Did you fear..

544
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:28,835
..your father would shoot me
if l tell him everything?

545
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:30,701
Young man! - l have not told
anything to your father.

546
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,034
Leave my hands or
l will call father.

547
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,235
How dare you hold my hands even
when father is approaching us?

548
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,767
Young man!

549
00:46:37,233 --> 00:46:40,035
ls your father, The James Bond?
Who is scared of your father?

550
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:42,635
Tomorrow after we get married l
will give him a white uniform..

551
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:45,636
..and make him stand as
a guard at my gate.

552
00:46:45,699 --> 00:46:47,101
With the same gun in his hand.

553
00:46:47,233 --> 00:46:48,901
Will you leave my hands
or should l scream?

554
00:46:48,966 --> 00:46:50,367
l am sure you will die if he sees
you with me. - Young man!

555
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,769
Just watch how our acquaintance
will develop into a friendship.

556
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:56,633
Young man!

557
00:46:56,699 --> 00:46:58,568
Show this watch to
your grandchildren.

558
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,567
Young man!

559
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:08,967
What are you doing here?

560
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:10,167
Nothing.

561
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,567
Where is the young man?

562
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,667
l don't know.

563
00:47:12,766 --> 00:47:13,800
Where is he gone?

564
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,033
l don't know.

565
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:18,835
Don't scream. What is in your hand?

566
00:47:19,566 --> 00:47:20,633
Nothing.

567
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:23,302
Uncle! Uncle! Where
did you go, Uncle?

568
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:26,301
Two minutes you went out
of my sight l was lost.

569
00:47:26,566 --> 00:47:27,700
How much l searched for you.

570
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:29,301
You know how much l
searched for you too.

571
00:47:29,566 --> 00:47:30,633
Where did you go?

572
00:47:30,766 --> 00:47:31,833
Should l have to tell
everything in detail?

573
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,568
Oh! So you went to the wash room.

574
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:36,302
lsn't he very funny?
Like a small kid.

575
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:38,568
Uncle, my parents always
taught me that..

576
00:47:38,633 --> 00:47:40,234
..however great a person might be.

577
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,701
He should always be humble
and polite like a child.

578
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,801
That is the best advice
they have given you.

579
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,967
Thank you, Uncle.

580
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,302
Your daughter has no sense in her.

581
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:50,633
She is so dumb.

582
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:51,901
How did you give birth
to such a dull child?

583
00:47:52,033 --> 00:47:54,034
She has no judgment of
her future husband.

584
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:58,637
Look Uncle, keep a smart
man like me in front.

585
00:47:58,833 --> 00:47:59,900
Keep?

586
00:47:59,966 --> 00:48:05,538
Your aim, uncle. What a super aim
it was! Looking at your aim.

587
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:08,035
Any one can say what a super
army officer you are.

588
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:09,834
Thank you! Thank you!
Shall we continue?

589
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,967
Yes, yes. Come on uncle.
- Father!

590
00:48:11,233 --> 00:48:13,702
Mother is waiting to
give you an oil bath.

591
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:15,634
Today is your Marriage anniversary.

592
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:16,900
Don't you remember that?

593
00:48:16,933 --> 00:48:18,734
Will you come home fast or
waste time playing here?

594
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:20,601
You decide as l am going.

595
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:21,834
Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't go.

596
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,767
l thought it was tomorrow.

597
00:48:23,966 --> 00:48:25,634
She might eat me alive
if l go alone.

598
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:27,568
She will keep quiet if you are
with me. Come on. Come on.

599
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:28,700
Yes uncle. Yes Uncle.

600
00:48:43,566 --> 00:48:45,501
Pritu, there will be many people..

601
00:48:45,566 --> 00:48:47,701
..present at the
anniversary party today.

602
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,534
You behave yourself and
do not play pranks.

603
00:48:49,633 --> 00:48:52,502
Mother, you will never find
another decent man..

604
00:48:52,533 --> 00:48:54,835
..like me on this earth.
One minute, l will come.

605
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:58,235
Aunt, Being a lady how could
you do this to the other?

606
00:48:58,699 --> 00:48:59,767
What did l do?

607
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,102
Mom is very sad that you
are not accompanying her.

608
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,767
Why don't you come in my car, Aunt?

609
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:07,102
Yes it is true. How foolish of me
to leave her alone and come here.

610
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:09,034
l will go with her. Nandu!

611
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:11,635
Give it to me aunt. l will take care.
l will hold it.

612
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,835
Nandu, you come with father. Okay?

613
00:49:14,566 --> 00:49:15,967
Yes.
- Hi! Young man.

614
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:19,503
Hello! Uncle! Wow! Uncle!
Looking great.

615
00:49:19,566 --> 00:49:20,633
You too.
- Thank you, Uncle.

616
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:21,734
Come on let us go.

617
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:22,900
Uncle, l am going there.

618
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:24,234
Oh! Chauffeuring the ladies?
- Yes.

619
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,534
How noble.

620
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,901
Get in. Come on.

621
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:31,569
Call me. Call me. l will
drive the car. Call me.

622
00:49:31,699 --> 00:49:32,767
Young man!

623
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:34,100
Uncle! Yes uncle.

624
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,767
We will do one thing. Today
is my 25th anniversary.

625
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:37,768
Why don't you drive me to the party?
- Sure Uncle.

626
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,636
Daddy, this is too much.
l will drive the car.

627
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:43,101
Look, my daughter wishes the
same. Sit down. Sit down.

628
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:44,233
So nice of you. So nice of you.

629
00:49:50,566 --> 00:49:52,768
How far has your love
story gone, Pritam?

630
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:55,568
The girl is very slow, uncle.

631
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:57,167
Not yet come to the level
of hugging each other.

632
00:49:58,033 --> 00:50:01,836
Do you know my story?
When l was in the army.

633
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,969
l was traveling in
a train from Delhi.

634
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:10,970
ln the same train Babli was
traveling with her college friends.

635
00:50:11,766 --> 00:50:13,033
Your mother Kamala was also there.

636
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,902
You know how deep is Babli's
and her friendship?

637
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,437
You know your mother made us alight
the train at some station..

638
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,436
..and got us married
in a nearby temple.

639
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,968
And sent us back to Delhi.

640
00:50:26,766 --> 00:50:28,167
lt was monsoon then.

641
00:50:28,466 --> 00:50:31,836
Look, those days were also
monsoon. What to do?

642
00:50:32,666 --> 00:50:34,834
Babli's people blamed your mother.
- Yeah!

643
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:40,171
We came back after a year with
a child in Babli's arms.

644
00:50:41,566 --> 00:50:44,702
Nobody said anything to me.
Everything settled smoothly.

645
00:50:44,966 --> 00:50:48,502
You are a handsome hunk, uncle.
Whatever you do will be okay.

646
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:51,569
lf people like you and
me run with a girl.

647
00:50:51,699 --> 00:50:54,102
People will not talk. Love
is something strange.

648
00:50:54,166 --> 00:50:55,834
You know everything
went fine with us.

649
00:50:55,966 --> 00:50:57,767
Why don't you keep quiet
when l am talking?

650
00:50:58,366 --> 00:50:59,834
Who made him a Colonel?

651
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:02,568
Doesn't he need to have manners?
Cannot bear this torture.

652
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:04,968
Father and daughter
are equally same.

653
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:07,567
l am keeping quiet because he
is my future father-in-law.

654
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,902
Otherwise l would have slit his
tongue and put it in the pocket.

655
00:51:19,566 --> 00:51:21,367
lt is destined that
your father will be..

656
00:51:21,433 --> 00:51:23,101
..my father-in-law in
all my seven lives.

657
00:51:23,566 --> 00:51:25,434
Who is scared of him?

658
00:51:25,966 --> 00:51:29,569
Who cares whether he can hear
or not? l don't care.

659
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:31,367
You just hear this. Father-in-law,
if l take..

660
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:33,368
..your daughter to Bangalore now.

661
00:51:33,433 --> 00:51:36,369
And take admission in the
school for the children..

662
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,770
..we will bear in future
and then return home.

663
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:40,967
Do you have any problem in this?

664
00:51:41,566 --> 00:51:43,501
Not at all. You drive cautiously.

665
00:51:44,366 --> 00:51:46,367
Thanks. Look, if there was father
like yours all around.

666
00:51:46,433 --> 00:51:49,102
There would have been no
problems to any lovers.

667
00:51:49,433 --> 00:51:51,101
Poor soul how easily he agreed.

668
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,634
Papa, have you gone mad?
What is wrong with you?

669
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:54,700
Wait l will tell mama.

670
00:51:54,766 --> 00:51:56,901
lf he talking so cheaply you are
sitting and grinning there.

671
00:51:56,966 --> 00:51:58,033
l hate you.

672
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,367
Something wrong?

673
00:51:59,433 --> 00:52:00,767
On top of that you are asking
if something is wrong.

674
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:01,900
What more wrong should happen?

675
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,434
Papa, be a little serious.

676
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:11,534
You are grinning and agreeing
to everything this idiot says.

677
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:12,734
What is wrong with you?

678
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:14,434
Did you hear her, young man?

679
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,567
Yes, l heard her uncle.

680
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,701
Hello Sir, wish you
a happy anniversary.

681
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:18,833
Oh! Thank you.

682
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:20,300
Welcome sir.
- Thank you.

683
00:52:20,633 --> 00:52:21,700
Everything is ready.
- Is it? Very Good.

684
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:22,900
Please come, sir.
- Very Good. Very Good.

685
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,367
Father!

686
00:52:24,699 --> 00:52:26,835
The battery of his hearing
aid had fallen.

687
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,501
l swear l did not remove it.
l am a very good boy.

688
00:52:28,766 --> 00:52:31,301
Put it back to the machine. Poor
fellow today is his anniversary..

689
00:52:31,366 --> 00:52:34,035
..let him at least hear
people wishing him.

690
00:52:34,366 --> 00:52:35,700
Who me? Coming! Coming!

691
00:52:40,566 --> 00:52:41,633
Give! Give!

692
00:52:42,433 --> 00:52:44,701
Young man, aren't you
giving me any present?

693
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,601
With great difficult l have
spent 25 years with her.

694
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:48,767

695
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:52,036
No! With great desire.
At least wish me, man.

696
00:52:52,366 --> 00:52:54,301
Yes uncle. Uncle, l am thinking
of coming to you..

You are always welcome.

Thank you, uncle.

699
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:01,968
Colonel, ask him to sing.

700
00:53:02,366 --> 00:53:05,235
When he sings in the bathroom the
girls in the neighboring hostel..

701
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,436
..sings chorus with him.
He sings very well.

702
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:10,634
Come on young man. Make my day.

703
00:53:10,766 --> 00:53:13,268

00:56:49,766 --> 00:56:55,505
''Friend, come listen to

00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:25,368
''And dance.''

743
00:58:03,433 --> 00:58:04,500
Wasn't my dance beautiful?

744
00:58:04,633 --> 00:58:06,301
Do you know what self-respect is?

745
00:58:06,433 --> 00:58:07,500
l have heard about it somewhere.

746
00:58:07,566 --> 00:58:08,633
l do not have much idea about it.

747
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:10,901
First learn to behave in public.

748
00:58:11,966 --> 00:58:14,101
Definitely. Just watch how l
will behave from tomorrow.

749
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:22,103
Do it fast, fast. Hey!
Do it quickly.

750
00:58:22,233 --> 00:58:24,935
Lazy fellows! None of
you know to work here.

751
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,634
What is happening, young man?

752
00:58:31,033 --> 00:58:35,370
Look at the ground, uncle. Tomorrow
if the bridegroom steps here.

753
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,102
l am sure he will slip and fall
directly inside the house.

754
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,901
lt is so slippery here. It is
okay if a person like me..

755
00:58:39,966 --> 00:58:42,435
..falls down on Nandini's
wedding day.

756
00:58:42,633 --> 00:58:45,435
l am born to fall. But the
bridegroom should not fall.

757
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,567
Am l right, uncle?

758
00:58:46,633 --> 00:58:47,900
Hey! Scrub properly.

759
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:51,102
ln Bangalore he does not lift the
coffee mug from here to there.

760
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:52,601
He is from such a lazy family.

761
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:55,168
After coming here l don't know
what has happened to him.

762
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,367
lf his father was here.

763
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,169
He surely would have got a heart
attack looking at his son working.

764
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,937
The matter is very serious,
friends. Scrub here properly.

765
00:59:10,633 --> 00:59:12,634
Mother, l am getting late.
Can l leave?

766
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,634
Did you listen when l said
to leave little early?

767
00:59:14,966 --> 00:59:17,301
ls Balkapur railway close by?

768
00:59:17,433 --> 00:59:20,302
By the time you travel 150 kms the
train will already reach the station.

769
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:26,605
Okay mother, Bye! Bye!
Aunt. Rama! Rama!

770
00:59:27,266 --> 00:59:28,367
Didn't l tell you in the morning..

771
00:59:28,433 --> 00:59:30,168
..that we have to go
to Balkapur station.

772
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:33,634
She studied in Mumbai.

773
00:59:33,966 --> 00:59:36,935
Now when her friends come down
there will be mayhem in the house.

774
00:59:38,566 --> 00:59:40,301
Oh! God!

775
00:59:43,966 --> 00:59:45,167
Rama, why did you fall?

776
00:59:45,233 --> 00:59:47,635
Can't you take care of the few
bones left in your body?

777
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,303
Get up, my dear. Get up!
Get up! Poor fellow!

778
00:59:52,233 --> 00:59:54,234
Master! Sister!

779
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:56,367
lf l ask him to drive. He gets
into some problem or other.

780
00:59:56,466 --> 00:59:57,867
Poor fellow slipped and fell down.

781
00:59:58,033 --> 00:59:59,534
Father, l am sure he will
not get ready today.

782
00:59:59,866 --> 01:00:02,235
l am getting late. l will drive
but do not tell mother that.

783
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:03,433
Go.

784
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:05,234
Okay, but be careful sweety.

785
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,901
Side please! Side please!
Side please! Side please!

786
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:09,834
Hello! Excuse me why were
you crying in the morning?

787
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,102
You were telling that there
was some accident.

788
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,300
What accident?

789
01:00:13,366 --> 01:00:14,834
Yes master. There was an accident
at the highway road..

790
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,301
..and 100 people died in that.

791
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:17,834
Among them my neighbor's
wife also died.

792
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,101
That is why l am sad.

793
01:00:19,566 --> 01:00:25,305
Nandini wait! Do not go alone.
Go with Pritam. Young man!

794
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:27,233
Uncle! Uncle!

795
01:00:27,433 --> 01:00:28,467
Have you come here?
- Yes.

796
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:29,867
Go with her please!

797
01:00:29,966 --> 01:00:35,538
There is so much work here.
l cannot leave it halfway.

798
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:38,101
Come on. Come on. Just go
like this, it is all right.

799
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:39,834
Uncle, l am feeling shy
to go in this dress.

800
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,534
Fine. Then, change
and go. Quickly go.

801
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,368
Just because you are asking me, l am
going. - Yes, l am asking you to go.

802
01:00:46,433 --> 01:00:49,903
Stop it. No! No! Please no!

803
01:00:49,966 --> 01:00:51,033
Stop the car.

804
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:52,233
Yes, you're Honor.

805
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:01,267
Get down.

806
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,001
Oh! In this rain?

807
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,068
lf l had not come with you,
father would have felt sad.

808
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:07,200
That's why l came so far.

809
01:01:07,266 --> 01:01:08,767
Now, if you simply don't
shut your mouth and ..

810
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:10,501
..drive l will have to go on my way.

811
01:01:10,766 --> 01:01:13,301
Listen, what should l do? This
Devdas is making me laugh.

812
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:15,000
You know early in the
morning he was crying.

813
01:01:15,066 --> 01:01:16,500
l asked him why are you crying?

814
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:20,303
He said the elephant from
our neighborhood is raped.

815
01:01:20,366 --> 01:01:22,935
And the police are searching
for the offender.

816
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,768
l asked him, why do you
have cry if they..

817
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:25,900
..are searching for
the offender, Devdas?

818
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,769
You know what he said? The
police are doubting..

819
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:32,002
..that the hare has
raped the elephant.

820
01:01:35,366 --> 01:01:37,801
l said how could a hare
rape an elephant, Devdas?

821
01:01:37,866 --> 01:01:41,035
You are 4 inches and the elephant's
size is of a building.

822
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:42,835
l said the police would
not do anything.

823
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,201
Not to worry. Do you
know what he said?

824
01:01:44,266 --> 01:01:46,768
He said his name is already
in the police..

825
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:49,368
..records for raping
the elephant earlier.

826
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,702
Yes! If the girl laughs
it means she has ..

827
01:02:00,766 --> 01:02:04,202
..some feelings for me in her heart.

828
01:02:05,266 --> 01:02:08,202
Has she developed love
for me, Devdas?

829
01:02:09,733 --> 01:02:12,402
Why do you feel sleepy when
you hear about love?

830
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:15,702
Will you be satisfied if the girl..

831
01:02:15,766 --> 01:02:19,169
..deceives me and l start
drinking like you?

832
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:21,701
lf you are heartless then
from this moment there..

833
01:02:21,766 --> 01:02:23,434
..will be no relation between
us, Devdas. Get lost!

834
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:28,068
He is giving me all wrong ideas.

835
01:02:28,133 --> 01:02:29,200
What happened?

836
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:31,301
He is telling to elope with
the girl to Bangalore.

837
01:02:31,366 --> 01:02:32,700
Or else l will not progress in life

838
01:02:32,766 --> 01:02:34,100
Otherwise l will become
Iove sick like him.

839
01:02:34,766 --> 01:02:37,301
So l said l am a good boy.
It is wrong to do all that.

840
01:02:37,366 --> 01:02:42,137
And the girl will also
get angry. Am l right?

841
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,334
Can we leave?

842
01:02:51,699 --> 01:02:55,270
Be careful. After being a
failure in love.

843
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:56,701
He cannot stand the sight of girls.

844
01:02:56,766 --> 01:02:57,833
He scratches their face.

845
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,802
He is not like that. He has
become my friend too.

846
01:03:00,866 --> 01:03:02,934
He says he doesn't want
to talk to you.

847
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,001
ls that true, sir? Come here.

848
01:03:05,066 --> 01:03:06,133
l will not give him.

849
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,301
He is completely offended by you.

850
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:11,202
He says he has learnt all wrong
things befriending you.

851
01:03:11,266 --> 01:03:13,935
He came to me pleading to
teach him some manners.

852
01:03:14,766 --> 01:03:15,867
Now go check whether the
train has arrived.

853
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:24,034
Sir, will you look
at me for a moment.

854
01:03:24,099 --> 01:03:27,203
l am looking at you.
Tell what you want.

855
01:03:27,966 --> 01:03:30,234
What a look, Sir! It is wonderful!

856
01:03:30,966 --> 01:03:33,134
Sir, has the train
from Mumbai arrived?

857
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:40,640
Oh! l am fed of narrating the
same story that due to the ..

858
01:03:40,699 --> 01:03:49,175
..heavy rain in Mumbai the
train has not moved.

859
01:03:49,266 --> 01:03:51,735
You mean the train will not arrive?

860
01:03:51,933 --> 01:03:54,268
lt will. But will arrive
five hours late.

861
01:03:55,133 --> 01:03:58,970
What! five hours late? Boss,
take keep this.

862
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:04,568
Look Devdas, l do not want
to waste a single minute..

863
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:07,202
..of these five hours l am
spending in her company.

864
01:04:07,266 --> 01:04:09,768
lf you can support
me then be with me.

865
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,267
Otherwise go to hell.

866
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,901
l called home to tell
the train is late.

867
01:04:15,966 --> 01:04:19,636
Father asked to visit the
temple that is near by.

868
01:04:19,699 --> 01:04:20,767
Can we go?

869
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,602
lf you beckon me l can follow
you to any corner of the earth.

870
01:04:23,666 --> 01:04:27,770
Can we go? Devdas! Where is he gone?

871
01:04:28,166 --> 01:04:35,873
Devdas! Devdas! Look. Look at him.
l jokingly asked him to die.

872
01:04:36,133 --> 01:04:39,035
Right away he went and sat there.

873
01:04:39,633 --> 01:04:41,768
l don't know which old movie he
must have watched yesterday.

874
01:04:43,833 --> 01:04:44,900
Train!

875
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,200
Devdas!

876
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,767
lf you move an inch
l will throw you out.

877
01:05:58,633 --> 01:06:01,168
Never in my life did l run few
steps even to attend nature's call.

878
01:06:01,466 --> 01:06:05,636
And you made me run on the railway
track. Do not talk. Be quiet.

879
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:07,734
Enough of scolding him. l
am fed up of hearing it.

880
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:09,700
Fine.

881
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,835
How could you say fine
and keep quiet?

882
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,768
You did not tell any
stupid dialogues.

883
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,503
lf you do not talk anything special
it will be an insult to your tongue.

884
01:06:17,566 --> 01:06:18,867
Come on speak something.

885
01:06:19,966 --> 01:06:21,434
lf l talk, you tell me to shut up.

886
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,501
And when l am quiet
you ask me to talk.

887
01:06:23,566 --> 01:06:25,434
When l want to live you
tell me die and ..

888
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,634
..when l want to die
you ask me to live.

889
01:06:27,099 --> 01:06:30,169
How have you created these girls,
Oh! God! l don't understand.

890
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,935
You only have to take care
of boys like me, Father.

891
01:06:36,633 --> 01:06:38,935
Earlier when you were speaking
my body would burn with rage.

892
01:06:39,033 --> 01:06:40,834
But now when you talk
l feel like talking.

893
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:45,004
Oh! Why? Do l look like
cartoon to you?

894
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,435
You talk unnecessarily.
But l realized..

895
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,034
..you are a very emotional
person also.

896
01:06:49,633 --> 01:06:51,434
After all if you are ready
to give up your ..

897
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:52,801
..life just for the sake of a Hare.

898
01:06:52,866 --> 01:06:57,036
You really must be great. l have
under estimated you a lot. Sorry!

899
01:06:58,699 --> 01:07:01,369
l think even the God does not
understand your swing of ..

900
01:07:01,433 --> 01:07:03,868
..moods when you ask to forgive,
when you praise.

901
01:07:03,933 --> 01:07:06,368
When you smile and
when you get angry.

902
01:07:06,433 --> 01:07:09,002
Listen, after creating the girls.

903
01:07:09,099 --> 01:07:11,669
The Lord created one more item
immediately. Do you know what it is?

904
01:07:11,766 --> 01:07:12,867
l don't know.

905
01:07:12,966 --> 01:07:14,434
A sandal to slap.

906
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:35,372
What is this comedy? When it is
difficult to take four steps in life.

907
01:07:35,433 --> 01:07:37,535
These people are carrying a burden
and climbing the steps.

908
01:07:37,699 --> 01:07:39,501
By the way what do they
do after taking them up?

909
01:07:40,566 --> 01:07:41,600
Do they throw them down?

910
01:07:41,966 --> 01:07:44,868
Oh! Then, l should also
bring my father here.

911
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,602
You should not speak lightly
of this temple.

912
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:49,534
lf there is someone you like.

913
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:52,970
And if you wish happiness to
that person all his life.

914
01:07:53,033 --> 01:07:56,369
You have to carry him to
the temple at the peak.

915
01:07:56,699 --> 01:07:58,301
There is a seat there.
If you make the..

916
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,534
..person sit there and
seek God's blessings.

917
01:08:00,866 --> 01:08:02,867
The person will never face
any problem in life.

918
01:08:03,633 --> 01:08:08,904
That means if we carry the person
we like to the temple in the peak.

919
01:08:09,633 --> 01:08:10,767
The person will prosper
and be happy?

920
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:11,900
Absolutely! You are
perfectly correct.

921
01:08:12,366 --> 01:08:13,834
Then, why don't you carry me?

922
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:16,334
This is too much. Enough
of your jokes.

923
01:08:16,433 --> 01:08:17,901
You do not know the
power of this God.

924
01:08:17,933 --> 01:08:20,001
l will go up and offer
my prayers and come.

925
01:08:20,366 --> 01:08:24,036
That means you will not carry
me up. l am feeling very sad.

926
01:08:25,866 --> 01:08:29,302
Nandini! Before climbing
the stairs..

927
01:08:29,366 --> 01:08:33,970
..if you close your eyes
and think of God.

928
01:08:34,366 --> 01:08:36,301
l heard God will gives
double blessings..

929
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:37,867
..and there will be double effect.

930
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:39,867
Close your eyes and count ten.

931
01:08:39,933 --> 01:08:42,302
You speak any nonsense. Okay.

932
01:09:22,433 --> 01:09:26,003
What happened? Why did
you stop? Listen!

933
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,701
Father!

934
01:09:27,766 --> 01:09:28,833
Listen tell me what is wrong.

935
01:09:33,366 --> 01:09:38,037
l feel l have grown old,
my dear. l cannot.

936
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:41,468
Your father has become
an old man now.

937
01:09:41,633 --> 01:09:43,034
Why are you being emotional, father?

938
01:09:43,633 --> 01:09:46,669
lt is enough to me that you carried
me up all these years.

939
01:09:47,966 --> 01:09:51,969
l wished to carry you
up till my last breath.

940
01:09:52,366 --> 01:09:53,767
But l don't think
l can do it, child.

941
01:09:53,866 --> 01:09:58,737
With years no man turns young. Do
not talk like that. It hurts.

942
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:00,768
My daughter should never walk.

943
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:02,634
She should always be carried
to the temple.

944
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,568
l wish she would always be happy.

945
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:08,736
Father, next year your son-in-law
will carry me. Okay?

946
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,702
As it is we have decided
to get her married.

947
01:10:11,766 --> 01:10:14,435
So from next year her
husband will carry her.

948
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,969
Forget about it now. You simply
do not worry and frighten us.

949
01:10:17,733 --> 01:10:23,238
Good idea. Other than me it should
be her husband to carry her.

950
01:10:23,566 --> 01:10:25,234
Other than me it should
be her husband to carry her.

951
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,071
Devdas, l got 5 hours of golden
moments with the girl.

952
01:11:20,133 --> 01:11:23,803
And the girl is simply wasting
time staring at the water.

953
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,201
lsn't this injustice?

954
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,669
What is it madam you look very sad?

955
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,869
Look! Madam, the lake has come up.

956
01:11:46,066 --> 01:11:48,067
Five minutes back there
was no water in the lake.

957
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,001
Did you shed tears and fill it?

958
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:53,601
Why did you carry me to the temple?

959
01:11:55,066 --> 01:11:57,134
Oh! Is that the matter?

960
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,601
Listen, you told me
that if a person is..

961
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:01,601
..carried to the temple
and put on the seat.

962
01:12:01,666 --> 01:12:02,733
He would be happy in life.

963
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,934
So l carried you and made
you sit on the seat.

964
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:06,534
So why are you behaving
like a heroine..

965
01:12:06,566 --> 01:12:08,134
..of an old movie suffering
from cancer?

966
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:09,534
Please leave me alone.

967
01:12:18,666 --> 01:12:23,871
Devdas, for everything you ring
the bell and say no, no.

968
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:26,601
Then why didn't you stop me
from carrying the girl?

969
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:28,200
Look there, now she
is standing in anger.

970
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,603
lt is difficult to understand these
girls even if we are thousand times.

971
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,133
lt is raining.

972
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:45,668
Come! Yes you!

973
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:52,734
lf you fall sick by getting
wet in the rain.

974
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,736
Your father will shoot
me with his old rifle.

975
01:12:56,199 --> 01:13:02,005
And your dad has super
aim. Come! Come!

976
01:13:12,466 --> 01:13:14,501
Wipe the child's head.

977
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,101
lt is the first rain it might
be difficult if she falls sick.

978
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:17,467
Go child. Go.

979
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,567
Come, come.

980
01:13:21,466 --> 01:13:22,600
Poor girl!

981
01:13:22,933 --> 01:13:24,467
Show sympathy to me also, grandpa.

982
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,801
Even l am drenched in the rain.

983
01:13:25,866 --> 01:13:28,668
You come here. Come sit here.

984
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,801
l have some other medicine
to keep you warm.

985
01:13:30,933 --> 01:13:32,734
Being a man you have caught cold.

986
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,936
No, l am a good boy.

987
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,468
This is meant for good boys, take.

988
01:13:37,533 --> 01:13:39,134
ls it? But still l don't want.

989
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:40,467
lt is all right. You take this.

990
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,103
Take child wear this sari. Wear it.

991
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:49,968
Grandma, how do l drape it?

992
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:54,002
Foolish girl, don't you know
to wear a sari? Come here.

993
01:13:57,066 --> 01:13:59,001
You are refusing when l ask you.

994
01:13:59,133 --> 01:14:01,134
lt feels very good in this
monsoon. Just taste it.

995
01:14:01,466 --> 01:14:04,669
Whom ever l meet forces me to
drink. Why is it like that, grandpa?

996
01:14:05,133 --> 01:14:07,468
lt is the holy water
of God. Like God.

997
01:14:07,533 --> 01:14:08,667
l don't want.

998
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:13,403
Give this to him.

999
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,002
When l was young l had come to this
area to purchase livestock.

1000
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:48,535
Seeing my wife in this dress
l fell in love with her.

1001
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:56,006
Now you cannot do anything.
Now drink this. Take.

1002
01:15:02,866 --> 01:15:04,400
Foolish boy.

1003
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,070
''Don't know why l have
a feeling today.''

1004
01:15:54,533 --> 01:15:58,336
''That you are only mine.''

1005
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,337
''From the magical world.''

1006
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:06,003
''You have come for me.''

1007
01:16:06,466 --> 01:16:11,671
''Oh! What a pleasant torture.''

1008
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:17,337
''Kill me Oh! Girl for once.''

1009
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:21,869
''Just like that.''

1010
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:26,669
''Don't know why l have
a feeling today.''

1011
01:16:57,866 --> 01:17:00,802
''The incessant drizzle.''

1012
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:05,337
''Spreads your fragrance.''

1013
01:17:06,266 --> 01:17:08,501
''lf you go in anyone's dream.''

1014
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:13,271
''Turmoil in the heart.''

1015
01:17:13,733 --> 01:17:17,670
''The full moon took leave.''

1016
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:21,603
''Looking at you.''

1017
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:27,271
''l am a prisoner in your prison.''

1018
01:17:28,266 --> 01:17:32,603
''Come hold me in your arms once.''

1019
01:17:34,266 --> 01:17:37,268
''Just like that.''

1020
01:17:38,533 --> 01:17:42,570
''Don't know why l have
a feeling today.''

1021
01:18:00,266 --> 01:18:02,735
''There is sweetness of words.''

1022
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:07,204
''ln the flower like lips.''

1023
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,669
''ln the pages of heart.''

1024
01:18:10,733 --> 01:18:15,204
''There is only your signature.''

1025
01:18:15,633 --> 01:18:19,670
''Your name which is
not written in fate.''

1026
01:18:19,733 --> 01:18:23,736
''l have engraved it on my heart.''

1027
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:29,537
''Do you realize that?''

1028
01:18:30,266 --> 01:18:35,404
''Call out my name once.''

1029
01:18:36,266 --> 01:18:39,669
''Just like that.''

1030
01:18:56,466 --> 01:19:00,403
''Don't know why l have
a feeling today.''

1031
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:08,337
''That you are only mine.''

1032
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:16,137
''From the magical world.''

1033
01:19:16,199 --> 01:19:19,870
''You have come for me.''

1034
01:19:20,133 --> 01:19:25,338
''Oh! What a pleasant torture.''

1035
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:30,670
''Kill me Oh! Girl for once.''

1036
01:19:32,133 --> 01:19:35,736
''Just like that.''

1037
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:41,138
''Don't know why l have
a feeling today.''

1038
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:05,802
Should drink like this?

1039
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:13,540
When drunk, you look beautiful.

1040
01:20:14,733 --> 01:20:15,800
l am not drunk.

1041
01:20:17,066 --> 01:20:20,068
l am not talking about
you. But about me.

1042
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,133
Come it is time for
the train to arrive.

1043
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:27,069
ln this cool weather why are
you talking about time?

1044
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:29,669
Time means it is surely 420.

1045
01:20:30,066 --> 01:20:34,537
Time is there to deceive. Look, l
thought you would surely be mine.

1046
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:38,203
And a time would come when we will
have a dozen children of our own.

1047
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:43,667
That time did not come.

1048
01:20:46,066 --> 01:20:48,067
l thought you would hug me tightly..

1049
01:20:48,133 --> 01:20:50,068
..and shed one and half
liters of tears..

1050
01:20:50,133 --> 01:20:52,068
..and weep if you ever marry it
is to me and no one else..

1051
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:54,068
..that l am perfect match to you..

1052
01:20:54,133 --> 01:20:57,269
..l thought the time to shed
those tears has come.

1053
01:20:59,066 --> 01:21:00,300
But that time did not come.

1054
01:21:03,166 --> 01:21:07,069
l realized that l would
not get you in my life.

1055
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,202
Because my time is not correct.

1056
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:16,137
When the time is not perfect if
he smashes his head to a wall.

1057
01:21:16,199 --> 01:21:19,403
lt is only the injury in his
head he has to suffer.

1058
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:27,005
ln that, l have tried
to tear out..

1059
01:21:27,066 --> 01:21:33,138
..my heart and place it at your feet.

1060
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:36,234
My heart is spoilt.

1061
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,002
Your memories, this rain,
your smile..

1062
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:46,002
..your hair, the sound
of your anklets..

1063
01:21:46,066 --> 01:21:48,601
..your beauty, your voice,
your watch.

1064
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:53,003
The sound of that rascal diva's
bell all these have..

1065
01:21:53,066 --> 01:21:57,336
..made a un repairable
hole in my heart.

1066
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:04,605
l have given up. l
have given you up.

1067
01:22:05,266 --> 01:22:07,935
lnstead of being a loafer
in your opinion.

1068
01:22:07,966 --> 01:22:12,403
l feel it is enough if l rather
were a decent guy till my end.

1069
01:22:13,933 --> 01:22:15,334
But remember one thing.

1070
01:22:15,933 --> 01:22:20,137
Listen carefully. In
this rain one cannot hear anything.

1071
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:22,400
l will come to tell that.

1072
01:22:29,933 --> 01:22:34,337
Can l tell? You marry anyone in life.

1073
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:36,934
But there will be no other
soul on this earth..

1074
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,135
..who will love you as much as l do.

1075
01:22:39,266 --> 01:22:41,935
l love you that much.
Wherever you be..

1076
01:22:41,966 --> 01:22:44,935
..however you be even if you
forget me or remember me.

1077
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:50,939
Any many number of children you
have and you become old and feeble..

1078
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,472
..Even if you die one day, my love
for you will never die.

1079
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,935
One or the other day
even l will die.

1080
01:23:01,133 --> 01:23:05,136
But l will like you
even after my death.

1081
01:23:06,466 --> 01:23:11,137
Even if l take thousand lives
l will not love anyone else than you.

1082
01:23:27,133 --> 01:23:30,002
l am not miserable that
l will not get you.

1083
01:23:31,133 --> 01:23:34,069
The four days l spent with
you is enough for me.

1084
01:23:34,866 --> 01:23:38,869
With these memories..

1085
01:23:38,933 --> 01:23:43,537
..l can spend my whole life.

1086
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:50,300
Thank you, Nandini.

1087
01:23:51,866 --> 01:23:54,868
You are a Goddess who opened
my eyes regarding love.

1088
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,335
Till these eyes closes and
becomes one this soil.

1089
01:23:59,266 --> 01:24:01,267
l will not forget your favor.

1090
01:24:03,866 --> 01:24:08,804
You are a Goddess of Love!
But it hurts a lot.

1091
01:24:10,133 --> 01:24:13,202
But this pain is a sweet torture.

1092
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,801
Sweet pain! Sweet memories!

1093
01:24:16,266 --> 01:24:18,534
And along with that
a hot local drink.

1094
01:24:18,933 --> 01:24:22,002
lf this is in hand there
is no fear of losing.

1095
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,401
Little drink is left
Iet me finish it.

1096
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:28,801
Hey Loafer! Close your eyes.

1097
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,002
He is asking who is
Iove struck he or l?

1098
01:24:39,466 --> 01:24:45,405
No! Once when you held my hands
to help me l lost my heart.

1099
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,536
Now l don't know what
else l will lose.

1100
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:57,806
No, if the rainwater is shielded
you can see my tears.

1101
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,802
And l will feel embarrassed.
l will feel embarrassed.

1102
01:25:17,266 --> 01:25:21,003
''Let life blossom, friend.''

1103
01:25:25,133 --> 01:25:29,370
''ln the bouquet of friendship.''

1104
01:25:33,266 --> 01:25:36,936
''Let not the flower
of friendship wither.''

1105
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:40,936
''ln the bond of love.''

1106
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:46,071
''Let all the feelings be
buried in the heart.''

1107
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:56,743
''Let the music of silence throb.''

1108
01:25:57,266 --> 01:26:01,937
''Just like that.''

1109
01:26:14,133 --> 01:26:17,269
Hey, hi! - Hi Nandini!

1110
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:18,734
Hi! Nandini!
- Hi!

1111
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:19,867
You are late.

1112
01:26:19,933 --> 01:26:23,136
l am so sorry. l am very sorry. Hi!

1113
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:45,467
Excuse me.

1114
01:26:49,266 --> 01:26:50,400
Why young man?

1115
01:26:51,466 --> 01:26:55,136
My daughter's friends have
come, that too young girls.

1116
01:26:55,733 --> 01:26:58,735
lnstead of being energetic and
try to befriend a girl..

1117
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,203
..you are sitting like a crow
stuck on the electric pole.

1118
01:27:02,733 --> 01:27:06,269
l am fed up of life trying
to lure one girl, uncle.

1119
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,067
Do l need one more now?

1120
01:27:08,666 --> 01:27:09,700
lt will be very difficult.

1121
01:27:09,966 --> 01:27:13,803
Oh! Is it so? Then do one thing.

1122
01:27:14,199 --> 01:27:17,336
Take your girl to the
Malligepur temple.

1123
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:18,867
Everything will be all right.

1124
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:20,200
Do you think so?

1125
01:27:20,266 --> 01:27:22,868
Definitely. Haven't
you been there today?

1126
01:27:23,266 --> 01:27:26,802
How is the temple, that
devotion and that faith?

1127
01:27:27,266 --> 01:27:29,668
You will never find it anywhere.
By the way, thanks.

1128
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,135
That you did not let Nandini
climb the steps.

1129
01:27:32,266 --> 01:27:34,334
She told that you went up to
bring the God's offerings.

1130
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:36,068
Anything for elders, uncle.

1131
01:27:36,666 --> 01:27:39,902
Great! My daughter is a monkey.

1132
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:41,868
lf l tell her not to climb
the steps she will climb.

1133
01:27:42,666 --> 01:27:45,668
That is why it is decided
that in future if not me..

1134
01:27:45,733 --> 01:27:47,668
..than her husband would
carry her up those steps.

1135
01:27:48,933 --> 01:27:50,000
ls it, Uncle?

1136
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:53,937
Yes. From this year it will
be her husband to carry her.

1137
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:55,667
l have retired.

1138
01:28:01,866 --> 01:28:02,933
Yes!

1139
01:28:04,066 --> 01:28:07,669
Devdas, did you hear? What is this?

1140
01:28:07,733 --> 01:28:08,800
Everything is rotating.

1141
01:28:09,133 --> 01:28:10,200
We have a chance here.

1142
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:14,704
Carrying a 55 Kgs girl up the
mountain has not gone waste.

1143
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,636
lt is working out. l am in
a husband's position now.

1144
01:28:20,199 --> 01:28:22,602
Devdas, whatever l
say you are giving..

1145
01:28:22,666 --> 01:28:25,668
..a negative signal. You! What?

1146
01:28:28,066 --> 01:28:29,333
Where are you going? Wait.

1147
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:48,603
Look at your daughter. She will
be in this dress at her wedding.

1148
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:53,604
We just tried it on her to see if
everything is perfect. How is it?

1149
01:28:54,066 --> 01:29:00,672
Super! Wonderful! But
something is missing.

1150
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,734
Now you started your comments.

1151
01:29:06,533 --> 01:29:08,735
Young man, can you
think of anything?

1152
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:09,867
Yes l do, uncle.

1153
01:29:12,066 --> 01:29:13,133
Tell then.

1154
01:29:13,666 --> 01:29:15,000
Marriage is a big occasion.

1155
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:17,535
But at time like this if the
girl's forehead is bare.

1156
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,735
She resembles a ghost
in the horror movie.

1157
01:29:20,566 --> 01:29:23,168
lf she puts vermilion on forehead
she would look like a Goddess.

1158
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:24,534
That's it.
- Yes yes.

1159
01:29:24,866 --> 01:29:29,136
Oh! My God! How could you forget
that, ladies? Pritam is right.

1160
01:29:30,133 --> 01:29:32,668
With vermilion on forehead my
daughter will look like a Goddess.

1161
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:36,536
Great! Young man. That's why l
say to ask Pritam's opinion.

1162
01:29:36,933 --> 01:29:38,601
Go sweetie go put the
vermilion and come.

1163
01:29:38,733 --> 01:29:39,800
Go child.

1164
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:46,603
Kamala your son
is not an ordinary person.

1165
01:29:46,666 --> 01:29:48,200
Being ladies we did not realize it.

1166
01:29:48,266 --> 01:29:52,136
We just forget that, as she is a
modern girl. Look, he found it out.

1167
01:30:22,466 --> 01:30:24,067
She might come. She must
be selecting the bind.

1168
01:30:24,133 --> 01:30:25,701
So long? Something
must have happened.

1169
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,601
She is very dull since morning.

1170
01:30:27,666 --> 01:30:30,568
Ask her what the matter is. You
don't remove that. Put it back.

1171
01:30:35,533 --> 01:30:36,600
Hi! Nandu!

1172
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,468
What happened to you, child?

1173
01:30:45,466 --> 01:30:48,535
What baby? What happened?

1174
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,735
Why have you soaked
the wedding sari?

1175
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,601
Do you have to throw it like that?

1176
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,668
Now what has happened that
you are sitting like this?

1177
01:30:55,133 --> 01:30:58,669
Did anyone tell anything to
you? Rama! Bring the gun.

1178
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,469
Listen, for everything
you are asking for gun.

1179
01:31:01,866 --> 01:31:05,469
She must be sad of going
to Delhi leaving us.

1180
01:31:05,933 --> 01:31:10,537
ls it dear? No baby. Gautam
will be with you in Delhi.

1181
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,601
You will not even remember us.

1182
01:31:12,866 --> 01:31:14,400
Listen, l know how much
it hurts to leave..

1183
01:31:14,466 --> 01:31:16,467
..behind a loving parents
and go away.

1184
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,601
But if you worry and sit like this.

1185
01:31:18,666 --> 01:31:21,068
lt will shatter your father's
and my heart.

1186
01:31:21,133 --> 01:31:23,068
Yes child.
- Get up my dear. Get up.

1187
01:31:23,133 --> 01:31:28,071
Devdas! Devdas! Sorry uncle.
l came searching for Devdas.

1188
01:31:28,133 --> 01:31:29,734
l did not know that a family
discussion was going on here. Sorry!

1189
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:32,435
Hey! It is all right. Come here.
- Come.

1190
01:31:32,733 --> 01:31:37,604
Young man, look Nandini is little
upset. Try to console her. - Who l?

1191
01:31:37,633 --> 01:31:39,901
lf not you who else can
make her laugh? - Yes.

1192
01:31:39,966 --> 01:31:42,401
Then it is confirmed that
l am either a joker or a buffoon.

1193
01:31:42,466 --> 01:31:45,001
No! No it is not like that. But what
matter should l console her on?

1194
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:47,401
One never knows for what,
why and where..

1195
01:31:47,466 --> 01:31:49,668
..these girls
get depressed. - Correct.

1196
01:31:49,733 --> 01:31:52,402
Listen, she feels sad that
she has to leave us all..

1197
01:31:52,466 --> 01:31:53,667
..and go to a new place.

1198
01:31:53,733 --> 01:31:56,869
Look, cheer her up and bring
her down for dinner. - Okay.

1199
01:31:56,933 --> 01:31:58,668
And l will call her
friends for dinner.

1200
01:31:58,733 --> 01:32:01,535
Listen! All his life he
is being doing this.

1201
01:32:06,333 --> 01:32:09,369
Should l sing a sad song relating
to mother's house?

1202
01:32:10,033 --> 01:32:11,401
lt will set to the situation.

1203
01:32:11,866 --> 01:32:15,002
Okay l will not sing.
It is simply cancelled.

1204
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:20,668
Oh! No! This sari is
also causing trouble.

1205
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:23,334
l do so many wrong things. Isn't
it?

1206
01:32:30,666 --> 01:32:32,601
So are you here, boss?

1207
01:32:38,766 --> 01:32:42,336
The person with whom l wanted
to elope from here..

1208
01:32:42,366 --> 01:32:45,802
..is getting married
with another person.

1209
01:32:46,533 --> 01:32:47,867
And going out of the house
from the main door.

1210
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,735
Why do we need this
short cut, Devdas?

1211
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:52,733
Let us untie it.

1212
01:32:55,933 --> 01:32:57,000
Do not untie it.

1213
01:33:00,666 --> 01:33:02,734
l said do not
untie it. Let it be there.

1214
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:07,936
l did not understand. No need
to understand, forget.

1215
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:11,503
This is the first time
l am confused in life.

1216
01:33:12,699 --> 01:33:13,901
Everything is your blessing.

1217
01:33:22,533 --> 01:33:25,736
''Knowingly he is scorching himself.''

1218
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:33,473
''Has dived into the
whirlpool of love.''

1219
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:40,606
''Laughing even at the face of death.''

1220
01:33:41,266 --> 01:33:43,868
''What turmoil.''

1221
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:47,969
''Making me lend a helping hand.''

1222
01:33:48,366 --> 01:33:51,736
''To a sinking heart.''

1223
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:55,403
''This heart of mine
is falling for him.''

1224
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,802
''What turmoil.''

1225
01:33:59,933 --> 01:34:01,000
No. 1 .

1226
01:34:05,333 --> 01:34:07,468
Wonderful! 721/2.

1227
01:34:08,199 --> 01:34:14,205
No. 2. 771/4. No. 3, 813/4.

1228
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:20,236
Hey! Men are prohibited.
No entry for men.

1229
01:34:20,333 --> 01:34:21,701
Go back! Go back!

1230
01:34:24,333 --> 01:34:27,736
Clap harder! Clap! Clap!

1231
01:34:29,266 --> 01:34:34,404
Zero. Write Zero. Zero. Write Zero.

1232
01:34:39,399 --> 01:34:43,737
Babli, these girls are
crazy of your husband.

1233
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,201
And your husband is no less.

1234
01:34:45,266 --> 01:34:47,334
Look how he is enjoying wearing that
T-shirt and shorts among the girls.

1235
01:34:47,399 --> 01:34:50,469
Okay! Okay! l will give everyone
100. Hundred! Hundred!

1236
01:34:50,533 --> 01:34:52,201
Yes, l am fed up of seeing this.

1237
01:34:52,233 --> 01:34:54,201
That is why l have named
him as Paramveer Chatri.

1238
01:34:54,233 --> 01:34:56,501
lnstead of Paramveer Chakra.

1239
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:01,337
Okay! Okay! l will give everyone
100. Hundred! Hundred!

1240

Okay not 100 but 110. l will

Okay. One minute! One

1242
01:35:09,133 --> 01:35:11,201
There are some more girls
coming from hometown.

1243
01:35:11,266 --> 01:35:13,134
Will you go to pick them up, please?

1244
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:18,405
ls it? Why not? Because if
you say l cannot refuse.

1245
01:35:18,466 --> 01:35:19,800
Girls l will see you back soon.

1246
01:35:24,133 --> 01:35:27,135
You told you would go to
distribute the marriage..

1247
01:35:27,166 --> 01:35:29,134
..invitations along with these imps.

1248

01:35:42,666 --> 01:35:44,601
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

1250
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:48,403
What is this? l can forgive
for the first mistake.

1251
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,134
Second time l can say it is okay.

1252
01:35:50,199 --> 01:35:52,802
But this is happening for the
third time with me. God!

1253
01:35:53,466 --> 01:35:56,335
Enough of this man's life.

You will know. Quick!

1257
01:36:07,133 --> 01:36:12,204
Devdas, that girl might come again.
Keep watching you humble soul.

1258
01:36:14,666 --> 01:36:16,601
My life has become like
a cabaret dancer.

1259
01:36:18,133 --> 01:36:19,200
Please, come.

1260
01:36:22,133 --> 01:36:23,200

Oh! So many marriage
invitation cards!

1263
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:37,367
Whom will you distribute this?

1264
01:36:37,433 --> 01:36:40,135
There are not more than 2 and
half houses in your area.

1265
01:36:40,533 --> 01:36:41,600
l am not giving it to anyone.

1266
01:36:41,866 --> 01:36:43,601
l kept that to avoid anyone
from sitting there.

1267
01:36:47,333 --> 01:36:52,337
l did not understand. Forget
that let me not interpret it.

1268
01:37:00,866 --> 01:37:05,303
Why have you taken that?
My life is in that watch.

1269
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,301
Do you think only your life
is depended on this?

1270
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:10,769
Do you say so? No, l did
not understand this also.

1271
01:37:11,066 --> 01:37:13,201
You will understand everything.
Stop the car let them go ahead.

1272
01:37:13,266 --> 01:37:15,201
Whatever you say?

1273
01:37:22,066 --> 01:37:23,133
Now?

1274
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:24,734
Turn to the left.

1275
01:37:25,333 --> 01:37:31,338
Okay. Yes. Hey! Keep quiet.
Do not talk. l will hit you.

1276
01:37:31,533 --> 01:37:34,068
Look, he is telling the girl
to change the route.

1277
01:37:34,133 --> 01:37:36,068
Ask her whether she is gone mad.

1278
01:37:36,133 --> 01:37:38,201
Yes he is right. Now run the car.

1279
01:37:38,466 --> 01:37:41,068
Your command is my duty.

1280
01:37:51,466 --> 01:37:52,533
One minute.

1281
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:03,269
Cycle shop owner must be her uncle.

1282
01:38:03,666 --> 01:38:06,201
Must have gone to give him
the invitation. Eat this.

1283
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,034
Hop.

1284
01:38:58,333 --> 01:38:59,400
Next?

1285
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,336
Will you take me to the
top of the waterfalls?

1286
01:39:03,666 --> 01:39:06,001
There? - Yes!

1287
01:39:09,266 --> 01:39:12,135
Keep quiet! Keep quiet!
Rascal you don't talk.

1288
01:39:12,199 --> 01:39:13,334
What happened?

1289
01:39:13,399 --> 01:39:17,203
He says the girls is really gone
insane and to be careful. There!

1290
01:39:17,266 --> 01:39:20,936
Since my childhood l dreamt
of going there.

01:39:21,366 --> 01:39:22,533
Will you take me or not?

1292
01:39:24,933 --> 01:39:27,669
l have been taking your orders
and done nothing else.

1293
01:39:28,666 --> 01:39:29,933
Come let us finish this also.

1294
01:39:52,466 --> 01:39:55,635
Wow! This is beautiful!

1295
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,301
Hey! Who is there to give
the marriage invitation?

1296
01:40:30,366 --> 01:40:32,201
You are also great.

1297

Next program?

1298
01:40:38,466 --> 01:40:39,533
Do not talk.

1299
01:40:48,866 --> 01:40:54,071
Tie this watch on my wrist.
Will you do it or not?

1300
01:41:07,466 --> 01:41:09,000
After all that happened.

1301
01:41:09,133 --> 01:41:11,268
l could not stop myself from
falling in love with you.

1302
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:21,035
Promise that you would never abandon
this hand that you held.

1303
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:54,167
What did you say?

1304
01:41:55,899 --> 01:41:59,870
l will make everyone agree to this.

1305
01:42:00,866 --> 01:42:02,000
And If they don't agree.

1306
01:42:04,166 --> 01:42:05,367
The sari l tied is always there.

1307
01:42:47,133 --> 01:42:49,468
''Come dancing to me.''

1308
01:42:50,066 --> 01:42:52,401
''Come with consent and love.''

1309
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:55,168
''The beauty of rain drops.''

1310
01:42:55,733 --> 01:42:57,968
''Falling on your dancing form.''

1311
01:42:58,399 --> 01:43:01,169
''You brought sparkle to my life.''

1312
01:43:01,233 --> 01:43:03,969
''Come closer than life.''

1313

''You silly boy.''

1318
01:43:17,899 --> 01:43:20,235
''Should l be precise?''

1319
01:43:20,733 --> 01:43:23,335
''You gave wings to my happiness.''

1320
01:43:23,399 --> 01:43:26,336
''Come let us soar in sky.''

''When you flex yourself.''

1323
01:44:18,833 --> 01:44:24,271
''There is pleasant
quiver in my body.''

1324
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:29,838
''You beckoned me with your eyes.''

1325
01:44:29,899 --> 01:44:35,872
''Without words or phrases

01:46:24,866 --> 01:46:27,168
''You silly boy.''

1344
01:46:27,533 --> 01:46:29,902
''Should l be precise?''

1345
01:46:30,199 --> 01:46:32,869
''You gave wings to my happiness.''

''Love is marvel.''

1348
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,034
Why? What did l do?

1349
01:46:50,533 --> 01:46:56,171
Look who is asking this? When l
told that l have fallen in love.

1350
01:46:56,666 --> 01:46:59,535
You should have hugged tightly.
Instead you made this..

1351
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,003
..poor man wait, torture himself
distressed and wasted my time.

1352
01:47:04,699 --> 01:47:06,868
Don't l have to test
the boy's character?

1353
01:47:06,966 --> 01:47:08,767
Doesn't he have to pass the test?

1354
01:47:08,899 --> 01:47:11,535
You girls are born to
torment the boys.

1355
01:47:11,833 --> 01:47:15,069
A dog's life is better than ours.

1356
01:47:16,566 --> 01:47:18,801
Now what? Will you marry
me soon or not?

1357
01:47:19,033 --> 01:47:21,535
Do you remember that in two
days l will be married?

1358
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,535
l have done a plan to
cancel the marriage.

1359
01:47:23,733 --> 01:47:25,468
l will surely make everyone agree.

1360
01:47:25,533 --> 01:47:28,068
Otherwise we have to elope.
Running away is not a joke.

1361
01:47:29,733 --> 01:47:34,637
l am a girl who is supposed to get
married very soon. Remember that.

1362
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:55,470
Don't anyone in your
house sleep soundly?

1363
01:47:55,533 --> 01:47:57,534
Someone is banging at my door.

1364
01:47:58,533 --> 01:48:00,201
lt will be difficult if it
happens after marriage.

1365
01:48:01,033 --> 01:48:02,200
Didn't you understand?

1366
01:48:02,766 --> 01:48:04,067
l will explain later on.

1367
01:48:11,933 --> 01:48:13,000
Aunt!

1368
01:48:15,633 --> 01:48:17,701
Come here. You sit here.
- What is it aunt?

1369
01:48:20,466 --> 01:48:22,901
Pritam, tell me who is he?

1370
01:48:23,966 --> 01:48:25,033
Who? Aunt?

1371
01:48:25,133 --> 01:48:27,101
The one Nandini loves.

1372
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:31,767
You know.

1373
01:48:33,033 --> 01:48:35,068
You know everything.
Tell me the truth.

1374
01:48:38,466 --> 01:48:42,036
Pritam in two days Nandini's
will marry Gautam.

1375
01:48:42,633 --> 01:48:45,435
That foolish girl now thinks
she is in love with some one.

1376
01:48:45,533 --> 01:48:47,534
And is thinking of eloping with him.

1377
01:48:48,633 --> 01:48:50,901
Who told you that, Aunt?

1378
01:48:51,066 --> 01:48:55,470
l heard it. l just heard her
talking over the phone.

1379
01:48:55,533 --> 01:48:59,069
She was telling this marriage is
cancelled and we will run away.

1380
01:49:00,466 --> 01:49:03,435
No, there is nothing like that,
aunt. You have misunderstood.

1381
01:49:03,666 --> 01:49:05,334
She is the child l borne.

1382
01:49:05,399 --> 01:49:07,735
Hearing her breath l can
say what is in her mind.

1383
01:49:07,833 --> 01:49:10,468
You simply stop
supporting her.

1384
01:49:11,866 --> 01:49:16,971
Unluckily if Nandini thinks of
running away with that boy.

1385
01:49:17,033 --> 01:49:19,668
Do you know what calamity
will befall on us?

1386
01:49:19,733 --> 01:49:23,403
Do you know the boy she is
to marry will be cheated?

1387
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:27,403
Do you know Prityam, how many people
will lose their peace of mind here?

1388
01:49:29,566 --> 01:49:34,470
Listen here, the man you look
daily, my husband Colonel Subbaiah.

1389
01:49:34,766 --> 01:49:38,703
Today he is among us alive and
happy all because of that Gautam.

1390
01:49:39,399 --> 01:49:41,335
Two years back he saved my husband..

1391
01:49:41,399 --> 01:49:45,771
..from the bullets of the enemy
while fighting in the border.

1392
01:49:46,833 --> 01:49:49,335
Gautam is a soldier of whom
the whole country..

1393
01:49:49,399 --> 01:49:51,735
..and whole of Kodagu is proud of.

1394
01:49:52,333 --> 01:49:54,334
My husband and l must have
done some good deeds..

1395
01:49:54,366 --> 01:49:56,634
..in life to have Gautam
as a Son-in-law.

1396
01:49:57,566 --> 01:50:00,068
Now Nandini is doing like this.

1397
01:50:07,766 --> 01:50:12,270
Look here Pritam, my husband,
my daughter and l..

1398
01:50:12,333 --> 01:50:15,769
..the whole house has placed
our confidence in you.

1399
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:20,269
l feel the Lord only has
sent a kind hearted boy..

1400
01:50:20,333 --> 01:50:23,269
..like you to us. Our
Nandu doesn't trust..

1401
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:26,603
..or gets friendly with
anyone so easily.

1402
01:50:26,899 --> 01:50:30,470
But with you she is very
comfortable and happy.

1403
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:35,004
She must have surely told
you who the boy is.

1404
01:50:35,466 --> 01:50:36,767
Tell me who it is, Pritu.

1405
01:50:43,666 --> 01:50:44,733
lt's me Aunt.

1406
01:50:50,699 --> 01:50:52,802
Pritam, do not joke.

1407
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:56,369
Don't you understand how much
a mother's heart is agonized?

1408
01:50:58,300 --> 01:51:02,570
Look, ask her who he is and
try to bring her to her senses.

1409
01:51:02,766 --> 01:51:05,201
lt is your responsibility
that she does not commit..

1410
01:51:05,266 --> 01:51:08,202
..any mistakes and see to that
her marriage to Gautam..

1411
01:51:08,266 --> 01:51:10,835
..solemnizes without any obstacles.

1412
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:13,201
Pritam, l do not have the strength..

1413
01:51:13,266 --> 01:51:16,268
..with me to speak
this matter to anyone.

1414
01:51:16,766 --> 01:51:19,268
Our respect and honor are in your
hands.

1415
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,868
Please do something, Pritam.

1416
01:51:24,433 --> 01:51:25,500
Please!

1417
01:51:27,699 --> 01:51:28,767
Thank you.

1418
01:51:56,266 --> 01:52:01,838
Okay Gautam. Welcome. We will
be waiting. Happy Journey. Bye!

1419
01:52:04,266 --> 01:52:07,569
Babli, all of them have left. They
will reach Bangalore in the evening.

1420
01:52:07,633 --> 01:52:09,267
And in the morning they will be here.
- Okay.

1421
01:52:27,866 --> 01:52:30,602
What Boss? Looks like
you are free today.

1422
01:52:40,466 --> 01:52:45,204
What dear? Why is my baby
sleeping on my lap today?

1423
01:52:49,866 --> 01:52:54,136
Mummy, the girl l
was talking about..

1424
01:52:54,199 --> 01:52:59,305
..all these days is none
other but Nandini.

1425
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:06,371
Nandini also likes me and is
ready to run away with me.

1426
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:13,603
Mother, l cannot live without her.

1427
01:53:23,466 --> 01:53:26,802
From the day you were born till
today l had not hit you even for fun.

1428
01:53:27,666 --> 01:53:29,234
But today l have.

1429
01:53:29,699 --> 01:53:34,404
l did not know she was getting
married. What could l do?

1430
01:53:35,066 --> 01:53:36,200
Forget her.

1431
01:53:38,566 --> 01:53:40,067
This whole family
has various dreams..

1432
01:53:40,133 --> 01:53:43,669
..and hopes for Nandini's
marriage and future.

1433
01:53:45,366 --> 01:53:47,768
Don't be a sinner to
spoil their life.

1434
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:57,606
Look here child Pritu my dearest
friend should not be a widow.

1435
01:53:59,166 --> 01:54:03,537
People will blame you for spoiling
an innocent girl's mind.

1436
01:54:05,433 --> 01:54:08,235
Loving is not great.
Sacrifice is great.

1437
01:54:10,066 --> 01:54:14,637
Family, respect and humanity
is more important than that.

1438
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:18,735
Be a human and not an animal.

1439
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:48,267
What did mummy tell?

1440
01:54:48,333 --> 01:54:50,301
l do not have time to talk
about your mother or mine.

1441
01:54:50,333 --> 01:54:51,500
Do not ask what and why.

1442
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,034
lf there is any one
who could save us..

1443
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:55,101
..than it is your father The
Great Colonel Subbaiah.

1444
01:54:55,433 --> 01:55:01,071
l will tell him. Beg with him.
If he doesn't agree.

1445
01:55:01,133 --> 01:55:02,200
lf he doesn't agree?

1446
01:55:24,233 --> 01:55:29,271
What happened? What did you
talk to Nandini? Will she?

1447
01:55:29,333 --> 01:55:35,572
Aunt, you don't worry. Your daughter
will always be happy in life.

1448
01:55:36,399 --> 01:55:37,467
l am there to see to that.

1449
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:48,068
The marriage day is
fast approaching.

1450
01:55:48,133 --> 01:55:50,001
Does any one of you have
seriousness in life?

1451
01:55:50,266 --> 01:55:51,934
First complete the work
l have given you..

1452
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,302
..and then show me
your face. Get out!

1453
01:55:56,066 --> 01:55:57,367
No one is serious here.

1454
01:55:57,433 --> 01:55:59,935
You do not yell like that.
It does not solve any problem.

1455
01:56:00,566 --> 01:56:02,434
Learn to be little silent.

1456
01:56:02,533 --> 01:56:05,435
l know it, Babli. l know it.
Where did l shout?

1457
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,668
l am doing my work silently.

1458
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,468
No need of you preaching me.

1459
01:56:09,933 --> 01:56:14,003
Master! - Hey don't shout.
Are you deaf? What?

1460
01:56:14,133 --> 01:56:15,200
The priest.

1461
01:56:15,433 --> 01:56:19,303
Oh! Good morning! l mean hello.

1462
01:56:19,566 --> 01:56:22,201
Good morning, sir. A very good
morning. How are you, sir?

1463
01:56:22,266 --> 01:56:23,333
You.

1464
01:56:23,466 --> 01:56:28,003
Here l am expecting a priest to
speak in pure kannada or Sanskrit.

1465
01:56:28,066 --> 01:56:32,570
He is speaking in English. Bad!
Rama, keep him out.

1466
01:56:34,066 --> 01:56:37,002
And you two, do you know Sanskrit
or is it English?

1467
01:56:37,433 --> 01:56:41,670
What sir? We have learnt our
Upanishads and Chaturvedas.

1468
01:56:42,033 --> 01:56:45,669
And must have understood it. Yes,
good and that is Sanskrit.

1469
01:56:46,033 --> 01:56:47,534
Rama, take both of them inside.

1470
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:48,667
Come, sir.

1471
01:56:51,666 --> 01:56:55,102
Where are you going? Leave.

1472
01:56:57,566 --> 01:56:59,601
Will you go or should l start
repeating in Sanskrit.

1473
01:57:01,166 --> 01:57:02,233
Thanks.

1474
01:57:06,199 --> 01:57:07,901
Uncle, aunt told that you
should not go for jogging.

1475
01:57:09,266 --> 01:57:11,368
l have stopped going for
jogging since a year.

1476
01:57:12,100 --> 01:57:15,870
Uncle, aunt told have you gone mad
to wear jogging suit to go jogging..

1477
01:57:15,933 --> 01:57:19,069
..when there is so much
work left to be managed.

1478
01:57:19,133 --> 01:57:23,170
Yes, l have gone mad. Tell
her l will go for jogging.

1479
01:57:23,933 --> 01:57:25,000
Uncle, can l accompany you?

1480
01:57:25,333 --> 01:57:27,068
Are you coming? Come.

1481
01:57:32,399 --> 01:57:34,468
Young
man, let us go back.

1482
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:36,867
We have just started.

1483
01:57:36,899 --> 01:57:39,302
Being a military man how
could you tire so easily?

1484
01:57:39,899 --> 01:57:42,369
l got angry when she
told l have gone mad.

1485
01:57:42,399 --> 01:57:43,501
So l came out of the house in anger.

1486
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:46,402
Now my anger has cooled down.
And l can't go further.

1487
01:57:47,266 --> 01:57:51,937
l will ask you something.
And then we can go back.

1488
01:57:52,266 --> 01:57:54,368
Look, you are in the company
of a deaf person.

1489
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:55,934
Your words should not go wasted.

1490
01:57:56,199 --> 01:57:58,969
See If my hearing aid has fallen
down fix it and then start.

1491
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:13,340
Uncle, will you get Nandini and me
married?

1492
01:58:22,466 --> 01:58:25,035
Uncle! Uncle!

1493
01:58:35,066 --> 01:58:37,268
Uncle! Uncle!

1494
01:58:38,133 --> 01:58:40,101
Uncle! What happened uncle?

1495
01:58:40,466 --> 01:58:41,533
Uncle.

1496
01:58:42,399 --> 01:58:43,434
Don't worry.

1497
01:58:43,533 --> 01:58:47,103
Uncle, come let me take you
in my car. Get up, uncle.

1498
01:58:47,899 --> 01:58:53,171
Don't move me. Two minutes. Your
Iegs are very comforting.

1499
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:56,801
l don't know how many times
l have fallen down..

1500
01:58:56,866 --> 01:58:58,234
..like this holding my chest.

1501
01:58:59,533 --> 01:59:04,471
Every time l got up alone.
And would walk back alone.

1502
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:08,802
This time it is my luck
you were with me.

1503
01:59:10,133 --> 01:59:13,169
This stupid heart. Why doesn't
it stop beating once for all?

1504
01:59:13,333 --> 01:59:17,070
Uncle, do you have to talk like
that? l don't know what to say.

1505
01:59:17,233 --> 01:59:18,334
l am still a kid.

1506
01:59:20,766 --> 01:59:23,235
l do not feel like you
are a young boy.

1507
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:28,370
Because a person with good mind
is always warm hearted.

1508
01:59:29,933 --> 01:59:35,972
You are very greathearted
boy. l don't why?

1509
01:59:36,466 --> 01:59:40,736
ln my entire military career
this old man never liked..

1510
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:46,338
..anyone. Never trusted anyone. Nor
there was anyone close to my heart.

1511
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,370
But, you have taken a very
special place in my heart.

1512
01:59:53,133 --> 01:59:54,734
There is a secret in my life
l did not want to share..

1513
01:59:54,766 --> 01:59:56,200
..with anyone till my death.

1514
01:59:57,133 --> 01:59:59,401
But, today l want to share
it with you. Can l?

1515
02:00:01,466 --> 02:00:03,968
l will finish it fast.
l will not bore you.

1516
02:00:04,966 --> 02:00:07,068
Do you need my permission
to talk, uncle?

1517
02:00:07,733 --> 02:00:12,404
l might die at any moment, Pritam.

1518
02:00:20,733 --> 02:00:23,001
l
am liv ing along with death , Pritam .

1519
02:00:23,699 --> 02:00:27,170
A year before l got retired
from military.

1520
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:30,168
l had a heart attack when
l was in my camp.

1521
02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:34,236
After that three bullets
got stuck in my back.

1522
02:00:35,133 --> 02:00:36,868
Two bullets were anyhow removed.

1523
02:00:38,266 --> 02:00:45,840
But the third one had gone so deep
that it has has wounded my heart.

1524
02:00:47,966 --> 02:00:51,936
No one could do anything.
There is no remedy.

1525
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,969
Only to let this heart beat
as long as it is possible.

1526
02:00:57,100 --> 02:01:01,170
My wife and daughter only know that
l have been wounded on my back.

1527
02:01:01,366 --> 02:01:05,002
But they do not know that l am in
a dying state or am waiting to die.

1528
02:01:05,333 --> 02:01:07,601
They do not know that l came back
here to my hometown to my house..

1529
02:01:07,666 --> 02:01:09,868
..where l was born and grew
up to breathe my last.

1530
02:01:10,199 --> 02:01:11,267
They should not know this, Pritam.

1531
02:01:12,233 --> 02:01:16,837
lncase l die before the marriage.
You have to help me, Pritam.

1532
02:01:17,766 --> 02:01:19,601
You have to hide this
old man's body..

1533
02:01:19,666 --> 02:01:21,868
..and see that the marriage
takes place.

1534
02:01:22,899 --> 02:01:25,335
Nandini is my baby, my life.

1535
02:01:26,266 --> 02:01:28,334
There should not be any obstacles
in her marriage.

1536
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:38,169
Do not think l will be quiet
after marriage, young man.

1537
02:01:39,233 --> 02:01:42,069
l will take rebirth in
my daughter's stomach.

1538
02:01:42,666 --> 02:01:47,937
And that junior Subbaiah will
play with a toy gun like this.

1539
02:01:48,666 --> 02:01:50,167
Wherever you are he will
come searching for you.

1540
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:54,336
Like you call me uncle he
too will call you uncle.

1541
02:01:54,899 --> 02:02:00,705
Like you helped me. When you get
old he would help you. Yes?

1542
02:02:01,333 --> 02:02:05,837
Do you think it is a very big plan?
When l know l am dying?

1543
02:02:05,933 --> 02:02:10,137
Can't l dream this much?
Thank you, young man.

1544
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:14,668
By the way didn't you want
to tell me something?

1545
02:02:46,633 --> 02:02:53,673
''Dreaming of living together
in every birth.''

1546
02:02:53,966 --> 02:02:57,202
''The flower of love blossomed.''

1547
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:01,003
''ln the garden of love.''

1548
02:03:01,266 --> 02:03:04,669
''Got burnt in fire of rain.''

1549
02:03:04,933 --> 02:03:08,069
''Life is distressed.''

1550
02:03:08,533 --> 02:03:12,103
''Like the thunder struck to heart.''

1551
02:03:12,199 --> 02:03:15,836
''Shattered are all the dreams.''

1552
02:03:15,933 --> 02:03:19,536
''l have lost all l cherished.''

1553
02:03:19,866 --> 02:03:22,835
''My way has come to an end.''

1554
02:03:31,899 --> 02:03:34,936
What is wrong with you? Why
are you avoiding me?

1555
02:03:37,133 --> 02:03:38,200
Talk.

1556
02:03:41,033 --> 02:03:42,768
ln two days it is my marriage.

1557
02:03:42,899 --> 02:03:45,869
Do you remember that l will break
that marriage and will come with you?

1558
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:49,736
Do you remember l am ready to
Ieave my parents just for you?

1559
02:03:51,199 --> 02:03:54,636
l am placing my whole life in
your hand. Do you know that?

1560
02:03:55,899 --> 02:03:58,936
Why should l remember that?
l do not understand.

1561
02:04:02,899 --> 02:04:04,601
What should l do remembering
all that?

1562
02:04:05,633 --> 02:04:08,836
Maybe for fun and time pass
l spoke of love to you.

1563
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:14,037
l did not know that you would
go mad to this level.

1564
02:04:15,066 --> 02:04:16,901
Will anyone call this love?

1565
02:04:18,899 --> 02:04:22,603
The girl who is supposed to marry in
two days is ready to elope with me.

1566
02:04:25,033 --> 02:04:27,402
What is the guarantee that tomorrow
you would not love someone..

1567
02:04:27,466 --> 02:04:29,568
..else and you will
not run behind him?

1568
02:05:13,966 --> 02:05:16,068
l have to leave this place, Devdas.

1569
02:05:20,833 --> 02:05:24,369
What can l do? People trust me.

1570
02:05:25,666 --> 02:05:27,434
And that is my problem.

1571
02:05:29,433 --> 02:05:34,738
lt is easy to gain trust but
difficult to treasure it.

1572
02:05:38,933 --> 02:05:45,706
l know Devdas if l leave this
house you will follow me.

1573
02:05:51,399 --> 02:05:53,435
So l have tied you up.

1574
02:05:58,666 --> 02:05:59,933
Forgive me, friend.

1575
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,669
Listen mister, in two hours
the sun will rise.

1576
02:06:54,733 --> 02:06:55,800
Are you going to sit here all night?

1577
02:06:56,633 --> 02:06:58,534
Why are you looking at my face?
What is your story?

1578
02:06:59,633 --> 02:07:00,967
Do not ask my story.

1579
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:06,569
On the first
page of my story the end is written.

1580
02:07:07,766 --> 02:07:09,868
Will you give one more bottle?

1581
02:07:09,933 --> 02:07:11,701
My fate.

1582
02:07:33,266 --> 02:07:36,369
Gautam, the road is blocked. l think
we will have to take other route.

1583
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:38,568
l will enquire. You see if you
can do anything here. - Okay.

1584
02:08:08,633 --> 02:08:12,636
Excuse me, is there any
other route from here.

1585
02:08:12,833 --> 02:08:14,334
A tree has fallen and due to rain.

1586
02:08:15,233 --> 02:08:20,538
When this rain can turn a life
upside down. And what is this tree?

1587
02:08:22,933 --> 02:08:25,335
Excuse me! One minute.

1588
02:08:27,533 --> 02:08:28,600
What sir?

1589
02:08:28,666 --> 02:08:31,402
ls there any other route to
Colonel Subbaiah's house?

1590
02:08:32,266 --> 02:08:33,567
This is the only route.

1591
02:08:34,199 --> 02:08:37,536
Oh! Due to rain a tree
has fallen on the road.

1592
02:08:37,766 --> 02:08:39,267
Will you help me to lift it?

1593
02:08:39,633 --> 02:08:43,403
Tomorrow is my marriage. l am
Colonel Subbaiah's son-in-law.

1594
02:08:43,433 --> 02:08:45,535
ls it? Come.

1595
02:09:29,666 --> 02:09:36,205
Nandini! Are you the one
to marry her? Die!

1596
02:11:04,366 --> 02:11:06,167
l understand your pain.

1597
02:11:08,533 --> 02:11:13,638
Love! You
Iove Nandini very much, isn't it?

1598
02:11:14,333 --> 02:11:20,238
My story is also same. l love
her as much as you do.

1599
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:26,101
Both of our love.

1600
02:11:29,433 --> 02:11:32,636
But in our destiny.

1601
02:11:34,233 --> 02:11:36,101
He is destined for her love.

1602
02:11:40,533 --> 02:11:42,067
Tomorrow is her marriage.

1603
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:46,667
And then she will go away.

1604
02:11:53,666 --> 02:11:58,270
The heart is breaking. Isn't it?

1605
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:12,169
Come, we both are in sorrow.

1606
02:12:13,433 --> 02:12:16,002
ln such a short span.

1607
02:12:26,566 --> 02:12:27,667
Bye!

1608
02:12:32,666 --> 02:12:37,570
You have a great heart.
You are great.

1609
02:12:49,066 --> 02:12:52,002
Hi! My name is Gautam.

1610
02:12:52,300 --> 02:12:54,568
My name is spoilt. No
use of telling it.

1611
02:12:55,133 --> 02:12:56,200
l did not understand.

1612
02:12:56,333 --> 02:12:57,400
No need to.

1613
02:12:57,466 --> 02:13:00,302
Anyways, my car is punctured.
Can you help me?

1614
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:04,602
l think l am destined to
help you to get married.

1615
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:31,437
Thank you so much. So, still you
did not tell me your name.

1616
02:13:31,933 --> 02:13:33,100
What is in the name?

1617
02:13:33,933 --> 02:13:37,136
Fine. My marriage. Please
come. You must come.

1618
02:13:40,066 --> 02:13:45,471
lf l come inside. Forget about it.
l will go. l cannot be here.

1619
02:13:51,866 --> 02:13:54,034
Can l keep this watch?
As a momentum.

1620
02:13:55,166 --> 02:13:57,434
Do not try to remember me.
It is of no use.

1621
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:01,602
Nothing like that, l liked
this watch. So l asked.

1622
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,301
lf you don't like to
give it is all right.

1623
02:14:04,199 --> 02:14:06,902
lt is not the question of likings
but it is difficulty.

1624
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:09,867
l did not understand.

1625
02:14:10,233 --> 02:14:16,539
No need to. l have crores
of memories in this watch.

1626
02:14:17,233 --> 02:14:21,203
My life is in it. l am sorry.

1627
02:14:22,166 --> 02:14:23,267
lt is okay.

1628
02:14:23,866 --> 02:14:26,868
Happy married life. Good luck.

1629
02:14:27,199 --> 02:14:28,267
Thank you.

1630
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:44,803
Excuse me, girls!
Can l speak to my wife?

1631
02:15:47,133 --> 02:15:50,903
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

1632
02:15:50,966 --> 02:15:53,234
Nandini, speak with respect.

1633
02:15:59,766 --> 02:16:00,833
Hi!

1634
02:16:00,933 --> 02:16:02,000
Hi!

1635
02:16:04,899 --> 02:16:06,735
From the day l got engaged
l have been carrying..

1636
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:08,268
..your photograph in my wallet.

1637
02:16:08,466 --> 02:16:11,802
l would always look at it.
Now l will live with you.

1638
02:16:13,399 --> 02:16:14,801
l am happy, Nandini.

1639
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:17,101
l am thankful to your dad.

1640
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:22,937
l never thought an orphan like
me would get a girl like you.

1641
02:16:24,266 --> 02:16:26,067
l will keep you very happy, Nandini.

1642
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,067
Attention!

1643
02:16:28,133 --> 02:16:29,167
Yes, sir.

1644
02:16:31,266 --> 02:16:36,037
You are a good sport. But
today you are only a groom.

1645
02:16:36,233 --> 02:16:38,301
And from today l am father-in-law
and you are my son-in-law.

1646
02:16:38,466 --> 02:16:41,101
From now onwards your place
will always be here.

1647
02:16:41,933 --> 02:16:44,468
Welcome to our small family.

1648
02:16:45,266 --> 02:16:46,333
Thanks.

1649
02:17:07,700 --> 02:17:09,668
Will you have a peg and
sit for the marriage..

1650
02:17:09,733 --> 02:17:10,800
..or after marriage
you will have it?

1651
02:17:10,866 --> 02:17:12,033
Oh! God! Early in the morning?

1652
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:15,870
Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine. We will
have it in the evening.

1653
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:17,267
Father!
- Okay uncle.

1654
02:17:18,966 --> 02:17:20,334
You get ready.
- Okay uncle.

1655
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,067
What baby?

1656
02:17:26,733 --> 02:17:30,236
Father! Father, l am sorry.

1657
02:17:31,899 --> 02:17:32,967
Why sorry, baby?

1658
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:40,805
Unknowingly if l have hurt you.
Please forgive me, father.

1659
02:17:40,899 --> 02:17:42,868
You can never do any mistake, baby.

1660
02:17:44,033 --> 02:17:47,169
As your father if l have
done anything wrong.

1661
02:17:47,866 --> 02:17:52,670
Please forgive me, my child. Other
than your happiness and your peace..

1662
02:17:52,733 --> 02:17:57,037
..nothing is left in
your father's life.

1663
02:17:59,733 --> 02:18:00,800
Thank you, father.

1664
02:18:09,133 --> 02:18:15,305
Why did you come with me, Devdas?
What is there in my life?

1665
02:18:18,166 --> 02:18:22,069
With great desire l lighted a candle.
But the rain doused it.

1666
02:18:24,066 --> 02:18:26,802
Hey, where is your son?
He's not to be seen.

1667
02:18:27,166 --> 02:18:30,869
He is on his way.
- All the credit goes to him.

1668
02:18:30,966 --> 02:18:33,601
l'll never forget
the favor he did to us.

1669
02:18:33,666 --> 02:18:36,035
l'll tell you later.
Get him soon.

1670
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:45,937
l did not know this rain
has fire in it, Devdas.

1671
02:18:48,766 --> 02:18:52,603
He is nowhere. l searched all
over the estate all night.

1672
02:18:52,666 --> 02:18:54,000
l did not find him. - Fine.

1673
02:18:54,066 --> 02:18:55,667
lf anyone asks tell
them you do not know.

1674
02:18:55,933 --> 02:18:57,000
Okay madam.

1675
02:19:00,766 --> 02:19:03,602
Kamala! Where is Pritam?

1676
02:19:03,700 --> 02:19:06,769
He is gone out. l had
sent for him. He will come.

1677
02:19:06,966 --> 02:19:10,269
Oh! Young man's presence brings
a charm to the marriage.

1678
02:19:10,799 --> 02:19:12,635
Send him to me when he comes.

1679
02:19:13,633 --> 02:19:14,700
Okay.

1680
02:19:20,033 --> 02:19:26,606
Struck in the rain and love
l got lost in life.

1681
02:19:29,600 --> 02:19:30,901
l have no goal in life, friend.

1682
02:19:33,066 --> 02:19:37,670
Will l survive with so much
pain filled in my heart?

1683
02:20:01,133 --> 02:20:02,634
My son, you look satisfied.

1684
02:20:03,466 --> 02:20:10,206
That l have come to your way. You
are sleeping peacefully. Wake Devdas.

1685
02:20:11,533 --> 02:20:15,904
lf you don't listen to me
who else will?

1686
02:20:18,566 --> 02:20:19,633
Wake up.
