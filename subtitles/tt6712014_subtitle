1
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,840
"Here's an extraordinary tale."

2
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,030
"The first of a two-part story."

3
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,260
"Here's an extraordinary tale."

4
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,390
"The first of a two-part story."

5
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,550
"There were four slackers and Bholi."

6
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,370
"The slackers made a business
out of their dreams."

7
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,200
"Their dreams gave them
the winning lottery number."

8
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,450
"And Bholi joined in this plan."

9
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,620
"But Choocha lied about his dream"

10
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,900
"and Bholi took advantage of that."

11
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,670
"She gave them a packet of drugs."

12
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,050
"They messed up and were indebted to her."

13
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,040
"Lali ended up losing Billa's shop."

14
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,340
"Even Choocha and Hunny were in her debt."

15
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,140
"The junkie's money helped them out"

16
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,580
"and the slackers made the most of it."

17
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,590
"God's gift saved them."

18
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,560
"The slackers laid a trap"

19
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,810
"and sent Bholi straight to jail."

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,240
"That's how the first part ended."

21
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,880
"Now let's start the rest of the tale."

22
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,260
Pal.

23
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,390
Hunny.

24
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,480
Slower, please.

25
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,070
Please, pal.

26
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,120
Let's stop here.
I can't hold it in any longer.

27
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,550
You shouldn't have eaten so much.
I won't stop.

28
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,930
Don't do this.

29
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,720
We've committed all sins together,

30
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,600
this is the last one.

31
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,830
Let's relieve ourselves here.

32
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Please, pal.

33
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,730
Hey, don't whistle.

34
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,510
They say whistling attracts snakes.

35
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
A black cobra. A black cobra.

36
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,320
A black cobra bit your butt.

37
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,250
I told you not to whistle.

38
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,790
Bholi?

39
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,900
I shall have vengeance today.

40
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,190
You sly fox.

41
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,220
You stood between me and Choocha for ages.

42
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,020
Today, I've gotten rid of you.

43
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,720
Now nothing can separate me and Choocha.

44
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,730
No, no...

45
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,630
Choocha, stop staring at her.

46
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,910
Do something or the venom will spread.

47
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,330
Choocha, you idiot.

48
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,310
Yes, pal, don't be afraid.

49
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,020
I won't let any harm come to you.

50
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,680
Mummy.

51
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,260
Go on, dude...

52
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,810
Run away from here.

53
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,960
We've come to the end
of our partnership.

54
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,850
From here on, I'll be with
my one true love...

55
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,810
Bholi, the enchantress.

56
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,100
This house turns into
a madhouse every morning...

57
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,010
You duffer!

58
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,500
Who the hell were you dreaming about?

59
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,060
Don't you feel ashamed?

60
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,400
Like father, like son.

61
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,600
And their WhatsApp keeps
beeping all night.

62
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,970
Beep. Beep. Beep.

63
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,810
It drives me crazy.

64
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm going to end it for now and forever.

65
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,890
I'm going to shut WhatsApp down.

66
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,160
But even your Kitty Group
beeps all night.

67
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,360
Shameless.
How dare you talk before me!

68
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,310
Get ready in two minutes.

69
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,160
Come down, and take
the dirty clothes with you.

70
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,240
If I don't wake you up,
you'd sleep all day.

71
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,860
Absolutely shameless.

72
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,060
I'm barely holding this
house together...

73
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,230
And he just wants to sleep all day.

74
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,650
Make sure you get
all the clothes back.

75
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,890
"M for Mirchi."

76
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,660
"M for Mirchi."

77
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,670
"M for Mirchi."

78
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,510
"-Radio Mirchi."
-Mirchi 98.3.

79
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,220
People who listen to Radio Mirchi
are always happy.

80
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,030
"Come closer..."

81
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,330
"Sing something..."

82
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,760
Priya.

83
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,710
"Come closer..."

84
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,200
It has been so long since
I first said I love you.

85
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,200
Now...

86
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,900
I think it's time we kiss.

87
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,400
Try the all new Sparkle...

88
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,480
With cooling crystals and micro plates.

89
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,570
You'll have super white teeth,
and the freshest breath.

90
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,950
The all new Sparkle.

91
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,230
Come closer with confidence.

92
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,870
Hey.

93
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,830
Not this kiss, silly.

94
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,950
The other one...

95
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,400
French kiss.

96
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,100
No, no... Not that one.

97
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,780
You eat meat.
Eating meat is not allowed in my faith.

98
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,600
Have you lost it?

99
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,780
Do you think the chicken
is still stuck in my mouth?

100
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,940
No, no... Not that one.
You stop eating meat first.

101
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,850
Come on, I'll rinse my mouth.

102
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,260
And...

103
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,260
For you, I'll quit eating meat
from today.

104
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,390
-Happy?
-No, no...

105
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,090
-What?
-Dad.

106
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,950
Oh, come on. Dad...

107
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,290
Dad.

108
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,880
Greetings, Dad.

109
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,050
"Dad."

110
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,020
Who is he?

111
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,250
Dad... He is... I mean...

112
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,420
I, Hunny. That is Vikas Gulati.

113
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,880
I love Priya, and we want to get married.

114
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,770
Son, we are Brahmins.

115
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,520
We don't wed our daughters
into other castes.

116
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,020
The age of caste is over, Dad.

117
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,650
This is the age of status.

118
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,980
I see.

119
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,370
What do you do?

120
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,060
I run an investment company
that doubles money overnight.

121
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,560
-Overnight?
-Yes.

122
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,350
You're not a criminal, are you?

123
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,560
Not at all. You can ask Priya.

124
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,310
I'm naturally talented.

125
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,160
In fact, I recommend
you invest some money.

126
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,200
I'll double it in a day.
Do you want to invest?

127
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,640
I'm a government employee, Son.

128
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,370
I've been content for 35 years
with the little money I make.

129
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,160
Over the years, I've earned
a lot of experience.

130
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,110
My daughter is wise.

131
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
Don't break her trust.

132
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,140
Great words, Dad.

133
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,660
Your daughter is like my daughter.

134
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,250
Don't worry.
We're like family now.

135
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,000
Greetings, Dad.

136
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,300
And this is going to be
your music room.

137
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,420
-I see.
-So shall I consider it done?

138
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,380
Yes.

139
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,690
Here...

140
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,100
This is five thousand less.

141
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,510
Mr. Bunty, the amount is right.

142
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,740
But it'll be 5000 more
for the marriage certificate.

143
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,680
Why do we need a certificate
when we're aren't married yet?

144
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,680
Sir, live-in couples are
not allowed to rent flats here.

145
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,220
So I'll have to make you
a fake marriage certificate

146
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,210
and that will cost five thousand rupees.

147
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,830
But the Supreme Court has
passed an order.

148
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,420
Live-in is legal now.

149
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,520
Madam, in that case, rent a flat
in the Supreme Court

150
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,480
because this society won't allow
you to live here.

151
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,310
Give back the check.

152
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,340
If it's just a matter of a
marriage certificate,

153
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,670
then we'll get married and return.

154
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,160
What?

155
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,400
I proposed marriage only
so that we don't lose the flat.

156
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,610
-Good.
-Don't get ideas, Neetu Ma'am.

157
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,440
Okay, how about a beach wedding?

158
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,740
Yes, pal.

159
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,740
Stop polishing your bike.

160
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,040
Girls won't ride on a pillion
with you anyway.

161
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,090
No problem, dude. Hope sustains life.

162
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,440
You are hopeful about the
coffee shop too,

163
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,820
but your father cares a damn.

164
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,320
Pack all this stuff.

165
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,700
Yes, sir, tell me.

166
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,890
My boy.

167
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,740
"Jugaad", not hope, makes
the world go round.

168
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,670
Amazing.

169
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,850
Wow.

170
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,760
Listen.

171
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,900
He had a new dream.

172
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,010
Meet me behind the temple
at two o'clock.

173
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,090
-All right.
-Bye.

174
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,730
First, he had a bicycle; now he has a car.

175
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,060
This became possible because of "jugaad."

176
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,270
That's your future.

177
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,560
You like that?

178
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,940
You'll get your loan, sir.

179
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,600
I'll need a copy of your electricity bill.

180
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,710
But I never pay the electricity bill.

181
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,630
I just tap into the open wires
and run my AC and cooler.

182
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,530
But I can give you a copy
of the documents of my shop.

183
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,630
-Will that do?
-Yes, sir.

184
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,250
-Are you sure?
-I'll make do, sir.

185
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,380
Hey, you lazy fool.
Where are you off to?

186
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,730
Yes?

187
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,170
Go get the documents of the shop
from the safe.

188
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,810
Should I sign in Hindi or Punjabi?

189
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,490
Dad, here are the documents.

190
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,740
Make a plane out of it, then. Fool.

191
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,900
Sit there. And take this.

192
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,100
Check the accounts properly.

193
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,680
All right.

194
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,840
Sir, one more thing.

195
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,590
I'll need your photo as well.

196
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,140
Everybody here knows me by face.
Why do you need a photo?

197
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,810
Do you know my dad?

198
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,830
Yes.

199
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,200
Dad,
do you know Bholi Punjaban?

200
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,100
Yes. I mean, no, not at all.
Who is Bholi Punjaban?

201
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,010
And how do you know her?

202
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,890
She has been in the news recently.

203
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,350
She lives nearby.
She's the lady don of Jamna Park.

204
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,390
I heard she's in jail these days.

205
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,900
No, no. I don't know
anyone with that name.

206
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,770
Aren't you getting late for college?

207
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,730
-Your friends must be waiting.
-Let them wait. I'll finish this.

208
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,360
Go, Son, I'll get it done.

209
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,270
Give it to me. I'll check it.

210
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,190
-Okay.
-Yes, I'll take a look, Son.

211
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,240
-You may leave.
-Okay, Dad.

212
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,760
Look, sir.

213
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,810
-Yes.
-I don't want a loan.

214
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,950
-What?
-I don't want a loan.

215
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,180
What happened, sir?

216
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,820
Central Jail Tihar
Women's Cell Number Six

217
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,070
You bastard.

218
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,750
I'm sick of waiting.
When will you get me bailed out?

219
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,060
Ma'am, it's a narcotics case.

220
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,650
Everyone is afraid to get involved.

221
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,240
I have been cleaning toilets here
for a year now.

222
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,510
They make you clean toilets?

223
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,390
Listen to me,
you servant of the constitution.

224
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,490
Bribe the judges, charm the ministers
or call the damn Air Force.

225
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,940
Get me out of here within
twenty-four hours

226
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,020
or I'll give you fire and fury.

227
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,390
Fair enough, ma'am.

228
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,540
You've got nothing else
left to give anyway.

229
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,020
Your loyal henchmen...

230
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,120
They're surviving by working
in communal kitchens.

231
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,750
The Almighty's blessings...

232
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,500
The Almighty's blessings...

233
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,320
The Almighty's blessings...

234
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,360
The Almighty's blessings...

235
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,070
And look at me.

236
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,290
After the expenditure on this case

237
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,950
I can't even afford to buy
stamp papers worth 10 rupees.

238
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,710
How will I bribe the judge?

239
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,790
My charms alone won't be
enough, ma'am.

240
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,730
You'll have to suck it up
and work your charms.

241
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,190
Arrange a cell phone for me.

242
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,220
"Old McDonald had a farm"

243
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,340
"and on the farm he had a barn."

244
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,190
"From the barn he stole a bale"

245
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,060
"and then he had to go to jail."

246
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,070
"Then he had to eat in jail"

247
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,950
"and work in jail."

248
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,670
"He had to rot in jail."

249
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,070
It's Bholi.

250
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,750
Mr. Minister, forget your anger
and embrace Bholi again.

251
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,620
If only you'd been this
soft and sweet earlier, Bholi.

252
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,900
Then you wouldn't be
stuck cleaning toilets,

253
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,750
but representing my party in parliament.

254
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,150
Get down to my thighs now.

255
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,540
I need to relax those muscles.

256
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,020
Let me take care of that, Mr. Bhatia.

257
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,220
Just get me out of here.

258
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,550
Then you'll see

259
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,060
how I help you relax.

260
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,110
Are you planning to send me to
heaven already, Bholi?

261
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,750
Let terrorists worry about
going to heaven.

262
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,950
Let's us stay on earth.

263
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,540
Tell me then, how much will it be?

264
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,430
100 million in ten days.

265
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,680
I want new young girls every week.

266
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,400
And in return for this favor
I want a promise from you.

267
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,780
I want you to make me a promise

268
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,830
that I can call in whenever I please

269
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,510
and you will come to help me.

270
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,380
All right.

271
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,030
Superb. Pack your things.

272
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,230
You'll be released within
twenty-four hours.

273
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,320
Praise the Lord.

274
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,400
How's it going? You saw the photo?

275
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,860
Yes, but it's not clear,
I couldn't understand it.

276
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,300
Exactly. Choocha is like jazz music.

277
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,020
You can't understand it,
but you still love it.

278
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,150
-Okay, where do we meet?
-Hold on.

279
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,840
12 briefs, two blouses,
a pair of cargo pants...

280
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,590
Write it down. Four petticoats,
two vests...

281
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,790
Return the clothes on hangers.

282
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,520
Yes, pal.

283
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,380
It's Katty's call.

284
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,950
No way.

285
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,260
What is she saying?

286
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,670
She's asking me where to meet you.

287
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,270
Call her to the zoo.

288
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,830
The zoo?

289
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,830
Have you lost it, idiot?

290
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,300
I'm trying to set you up
and you want to take her to the zoo.

291
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,540
But, dude, it's my childhood dream

292
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,370
to take my girlfriend to the zoo
on our first date

293
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,910
and then go boating.

294
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,930
Dude, she'll run away.

295
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,280
Dude, if she can't
respect my emotions

296
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,590
let her run away.

297
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,830
Hello?

298
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,360
Listen, will you...

299
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,580
-Will you come to the zoo?
-The zoo?

300
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,380
Yes, you got a problem with that?

301
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,460
-No, I'll come.
-Okay then.

302
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,020
"We've washed each other's underwear."

303
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,580
"We've cried together when
girls broke our hearts."

304
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,820
"No matter what,
come rain or shine..."

305
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,700
"Nothing is above our friendship."

306
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:09,280
"You're my best friend, after all."

307
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,350
And then Uncle Nehru called
from the moon.

308
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,760
I said, "Yes? Choocha speaking."

309
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,890
So Uncle Nehru said,
"Mr. Choocha,

310
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,090
the nation needs you.

311
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,360
The Chinese have attacked.

312
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,430
Over and out."

313
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,780
The moment I put the phone down

314
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,980
my mom said that "Rajma Chawal" was ready.

315
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,170
But I told her,

316
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,650
"Mummy, first I'll save the nation,
then I'll eat Rajma Chawal".

317
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,840
Hey, you're not paying attention.

318
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,360
Here I am, telling you stories for free
and you're yawning.

319
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,480
Go back to your mother.
The story is over.

320
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,590
-Hey, Changu.
-Yes.

321
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,510
Doesn't the beef ban
apply to the tiger as well?

322
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,300
-If it doesn't, it will happen soon.
-I see.

323
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,430
Hello, Mummy.

324
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
I'll be done in half an hour.

325
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,520
Yes, listen.

326
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,800
I hope you haven't cooked dinner yet.

327
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,270
I'm bringing some mutton.

328
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,710
Yes, mutton trotters.

329
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,480
Okay, I've got to go.

330
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,220
Hey, that's too much.

331
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,240
-Is this much enough?
-Yes, that's enough for the tigress.

332
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,540
Put some here.

333
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,310
I think even that is too much.

334
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,340
Here, keep the rest.

335
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,370
Yes, give me the mutton trotters.

336
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,520
Hey, Choocha.

337
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,190
If his mother scratches your back,

338
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,940
you will have marks as
big as the map of China.

339
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,200
You can't do whatever you like
just because the zoo is closed.

340
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,040
Dude.

341
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,680
Katty.

342
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,400
Man, I'm weak in the knees already.

343
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,250
And you wanted to go on a date.

344
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,950
Wait here. I'll set it up for you.

345
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,750
Dude, people usually go to
movies on first dates or the mall.

346
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,070
You've called me here.

347
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,790
Yes, because you have
a very special date

348
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,310
with Choocha the Great.

349
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,510
And the adventures
you will have with him...

350
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,110
You'll soon find out.

351
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,660
Okay, so where is Choocha the Great?

352
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:09,870
There.

353
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,670
That's him, his teeth are
like that of a rabbit.

354
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,250
Him?

355
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,160
Hey, don't judge him by his face.

356
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,950
He's really sweet and adorable.

357
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,100
And he'll keep you entertained
with his wonderful stories.

358
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,860
Come, I'll introduce you.

359
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,430
Katty, he is Choocha.

360
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,990
Choocha, she is Katty.

361
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,920
You guys talk, I'll go get
a burger and patty.

362
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,680
-Hi.
-Hi.

363
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,400
-How are you?
-Nice.

364
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,770
So do you like the zoo?

365
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,000
Yes.

366
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,460
I feel very connected with the animals.

367
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,680
How cute.

368
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,160
Cute.

369
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,550
He's cute, right?

370
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,230
This is nothing.

371
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,200
I was once hanging out
with a hippopotamus, and...

372
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,990
Oh, wow.

373
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,950
Your nails are so big and pretty.

374
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,750
-Aren't they? Thanks.
-Yes.

375
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,670
You know, I'm suffering from prickly heat.

376
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,310
Please scratch my back
with your big and pretty nails.

377
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,650
-What?
-I'll scratch your back too if you like.

378
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,680
Please.
Then I'll tell you a secret.

379
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,760
Please.

380
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,960
Please.

381
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,310
Ah. Yes, that's the spot.

382
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,900
A bit to the left...

383
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,960
A bit to the left...

384
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,120
Right there.

385
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,070
A little lower...

386
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,870
Okay, so what is your secret?

387
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,910
I was saying don't get
too attached to me...

388
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,240
I won't be around for long.

389
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,270
What do you mean?

390
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,340
Hunny and I are planning to
join a foreign university.

391
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,570
Yale University.

392
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,840
Will you scratch a bit
under my T-shirt?

393
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,350
Idiot. Moron.

394
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,350
Stupid, imbecile, fool.
What do you think of yourself?

395
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,550
First, you brought me to this zoo
on a date,

396
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,320
then you made me scratch your back.

397
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,230
Yale University, my foot.

398
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,510
I feel like giving you a tight slap.

399
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:35,000
"You, the man from Punjab,
don't try to peep at girls."

400
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:39,470
"Your mother scolded me the other day."

401
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,440
"You, the man from Punjab..."

402
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:49,030
"You, the man from Punjab..."

403
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,920
Don't whistle.

404
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,600
They say whistling attracts snakes.

405
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,670
Okay, I won't whistle.

406
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,480
Tell us your dream so I can go.

407
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,750
You only care about the dream.

408
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,070
I just got slapped.

409
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,230
Be happy she only slapped you
and didn't scratch you to death.

410
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,080
That's not fair, man.

411
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,880
When you do it you're a stud,
but if I do it I'm a fool.

412
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,750
Dude, you just don't have the swag.

413
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,640
Not everybody can charm girls.

414
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,070
You're no expert
in charming girls either.

415
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,000
Just tell us about your dream, Choocha.

416
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,550
Yes, I will.

417
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,870
That's all I'm worth.

418
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,150
You just want to make money
off my dreams.

419
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,110
You don't love Choocha.
You only love Choocha's dreams.

420
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,240
You will get rid of me once
I tell you about my dreams...

421
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,950
Hey, what happened?
Are you okay?

422
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,310
Black cobra, Choocha.

423
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,440
-A black cobra bit your butt.
-I told you not to whistle.

424
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,710
Do something or the poison will spread.

425
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,270
Don't worry.
I won't let anything happen to you.

426
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,330
"You're my best friend, after all."

427
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,000
Don't just stand and watch.

428
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,390
Not me. I'm allergic to poison.

429
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,280
Yes, it can't be Lali.
You'll have to suck up the poison.

430
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,040
Idiot, I meant, go get the bike.

431
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,590
Yes.

432
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,460
"No women, no hope."

433
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,630
"No future, no scope."

434
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,890
You hippo...

435
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,200
Bro, the cola.

436
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,000
What a guy!

437
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,470
Come on, sir. He's blabbering on.

438
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,030
It happens during a high fever.
Don't worry. I'm here.

439
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,990
Thermometer, please.

440
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,110
And your freshly baked
cake is now ready.

441
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,590
Happy birthday to you.

442
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,590
Thank you, but it's not my birthday.
Open your mouth.

443
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,240
You shouldn't put this in your ear.

444
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,070
-Choocha!
-He'll break it. Take it out.

445
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,180
Take it out.

446
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,390
It goes in your mouth,
and not your ear. Take it out.

447
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,560
-Bring the machine.
-Don't you clean your ears?

448
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,760
-Hold it.
-Ding dong.

449
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,670
-I welcome you to Jatayu Airways.
-Okay.

450
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,870
To tie your seat belt press one.

451
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,480
To go to the toilet
press your bum. Thank you.

452
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,150
Prepare an antidote.

453
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,190
Injection won't work, doctor,
give him electric shocks.

454
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,470
Sure, we'll do that too.

455
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,460
-Hey, give it back.
-Let go of it, man.

456
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,740
Stop him. Leave it, son.

457
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,710
-What are you doing?
-That's very expensive.

458
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,910
Leave!

459
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,870
Check out my muscles.
They're like space shuttles.

460
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,990
Son, your muscle will tear.
Get it off him.

461
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,190
This must be the first case

462
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,510
where a bite on the butt
has left him befuddled.

463
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,670
Listen, lad.

464
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,910
Don't let this boy with a beard fool you.

465
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,080
Move away before the flying saucer
falls on your head.

466
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,510
-Which boxer?
-Saucer, not boxer, you fool.

467
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,500
-Death looms above you. Move away.
-Choocha!

468
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,200
Nurse. Flip him around.

469
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,750
-Quickly, turn him around.
-No. No.

470
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,870
-Come on.
-No.

471
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,950
-It won't hurt, don't worry.
-No. No.

472
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,980
Don't move, the needle
will get stuck in your bum.

473
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,010
-It's almost done.
-No.

474
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,790
It's done. It's over.

475
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,410
Done.

476
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,160
What a pain.

477
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,690
To the principal,

478
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,960
Senior Citizen School.

479
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,240
I, Daleep Singh...

480
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,370
request you to grant me
leave for four days.

481
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,680
Yours faithfully, XYZ.

482
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,080
-Is he dead?
-No, he's all right.

483
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,220
Women's Cell Number Six

484
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,310
"Hey, you. Mister."

485
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,190
Will you go to Karol Bagh?

486
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,470
Yes, but I won't run the meter.
I'll charge a hundred rupees.

487
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,510
-Madam.
-Why have you brought this auto rickshaw?

488
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,680
-Where's the car?
-Madam, the car is gone.

489
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,200
Only the Haryana farm is left,
and two cows.

490
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,080
Mr. Bhatia raided every trade, madam.
He's a big player.

491
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,370
Dirty game.

492
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,750
The same minister pay 100 million.

493
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,120
-Oh, wow.
-What's so good about it?

494
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,930
We have to pay him 100 millions
in ten days.

495
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,190
Or I'll be back in jail,
and you will be back to Africa.

496
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,970
No, no, no.

497
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,130
Move.

498
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,000
Find out where those
four rascals are.

499
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,890
"Rumors..."

500
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,190
"The rumors are everywhere."

501
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,560
"I belong to them..."

502
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,010
"This noise has spread everywhere."

503
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,280
"The lovers are fake"

504
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,720
"and the rumors are all false."

505
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,040
"Let people say what they want."

506
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,720
"I don't care at all."

507
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,120
"Wanna love me?
Wanna wanna love me?"

508
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,600
"Wanna love me?
Wanna wanna love me?"

509
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,960
"Wanna love me?
Wanna wanna love me?"

510
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,080
"Wanna love me?
Wanna wanna love me?"

511
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,130
"Oh, my beloved."

512
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,520
"Oh, my beloved."

513
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,680
"I've lost my mind..."

514
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,880
"To your heavenly heart..."

515
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,520
"I have drowned in the
depths of your love."

516
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,530
"Oh, my beloved."

517
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,560
"My sweetheart."

518
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,970
"You are my beloved."

519
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,320
"I am entranced by your gaze."

520
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,600
"You are wonderful and magical."

521
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,580
"I'd rather die than wake up
and end this dream."

522
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,240
"Don't break my heart into pieces."

523
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,610
"Don't dismiss us as slackers."

524
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,280
"It's no big deal. We are smart."

525
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,160
"We've just got a few bad habits."

526
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,560
"Wanna love me?
Wanna wanna love me?"

527
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,960
"Wanna love me?
Wanna wanna love me?"

528
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,320
"Wanna love me?
Wanna wanna love me?"

529
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,520
"Wanna love me?
Wanna wanna love me?"

530
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,470
"Oh, my beloved."

531
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,810
"My sweetheart."

532
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,180
"You may leave if you wish to."

533
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,730
"It's your wish, what can I even say?"

534
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,920
"Oh, my beloved."

535
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,310
"I've lost my mind to you."

536
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,100
"I have drowned in
the depths of your love."

537
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,580
"It feels good to hear that, right?"

538
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,920
"I've never said this to anybody else."

539
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,020
"But who has the time for such flirts?"

540
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,010
"Leave if you wish to.
Bye, bye. Goodbye."

541
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,960
"If you remember who I am,

542
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,810
then hold the kite up."

543
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,530
We got Choocha. We got Choocha.

544
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,010
Madam, you've truly got them this time.

545
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,130
Come on, Pandit.
We were waiting for you.

546
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,160
It'll be your turn next, wait.

547
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,400
Bobby boy, get "mitti ka tel".

548
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,090
"Mitti ka tel." I didn't understand.

549
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,130
Man, I'm tired of these dolts.

550
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,680
Get kerosene. Go get it.

551
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,600
-Burning man.
-No, no, no, Bholi.

552
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,600
I've done nothing.
I am innocent.

553
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,160
Madam, enough is enough.

554
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,130
Just kill us and be done with it.

555
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:25,330
Had I wanted to kill you

556
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,450
I wouldn't have wasted
my savings on firecrackers.

557
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,410
You started this,

558
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,720
but I will end it.

559
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,680
Then just tell us how it ends.

560
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,770
Are you in a hurry, coach?

561
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,890
I'm in a hurry too.

562
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,730
I've got to pay somebody a lot of cash.

563
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,610
So here's the plan.

564
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:47,130
This game will end the way it began.

565
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,720
What do you mean?
What do we have to do?

566
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,290
The same thing you've been doing.

567
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,730
Play your lottery game.

568
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,600
But instead of playing with me
you'll play with the people of Delhi.

569
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,650
How?

570
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,440
You'll open a company.

571
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,730
People will bet a minimum
of 100,000 rupees.

572
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,490
For every bet, you will give
the bettor a legal MOU

573
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:13,450
worth double the bet amount.

574
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,050
You'll make a lottery number
from Choocha's dream.

575
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,130
That will be the winning number.

576
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,230
We will win ten times the amount.

577
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,620
We will give the bettors
double the amount.

578
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,840
That leaves eight times the amount for me.

579
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,360
"Hey, you. Mister."

580
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,480
What a great plan, Bholi.

581
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:36,680
I know you're doing this
for the well-being of our future kids.

582
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:39,720
And as a responsible father,
even I've made a plan.

583
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,400
Look, we'll deposit your
earnings in a bank...

584
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,240
Listen up, Choocha.

585
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,800
You alone are bad enough.

586
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,760
If you produce children,
then the world will fall apart.

587
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:52,170
I'd rather die a spinster,
than have your babies.

588
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,890
And I shall never be an Uncle
to your children.

589
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,840
At least tell me, what problem
do you see in me?

590
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,130
Problem?

591
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,500
You're such a buffoon, I'm sure
you shower in your underwear.

592
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,830
Can't you keep a secret?

593
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,600
You just don't want me to
settle down with anyone.

594
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,410
I'll settle you down.

595
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,120
Jail has hardened you, Bholi.

596
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,080
Ma'am, don't waste your breath on him.

597
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,160
We'll leave him with you,
hit him as much as you like.

598
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,200
We've only ventured
small amounts so far.

599
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,980
You're talking about looting
the lottery. We could be exposed.

600
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,170
So?

601
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,240
All my businesses have
shut down in the past 12 months.

602
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,570
Because of whom?

603
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,130
The four of you.

604
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,920
I rotted in jail for 12 months.

605
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,410
Because of whom?

606
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,690
The four of you.

607
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,360
I'm in debt.
Because of whom?

608
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,890
The four of us.

609
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,310
You fool!

610
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,010
Excuse me, ma'am.

611
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,550
Mummy!

612
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,530
You've had your fun.

613
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,330
You've made your money.

614
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,350
Now it's payback time.

615
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,050
You will have to pay a price
for everything.

616
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,440
By hook or by crook.

617
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,490
What do you mean?

618
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,370
Oh, dear boy.

619
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,770
You better hope you never
have to find out.

620
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,760
That's fine, ma'am.

621
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,140
But what will we get?

622
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,100
Look at him.

623
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,510
The boy has got some nerve.

624
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,920
You're no better than Choocha.

625
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,020
I'll let you live,
that's what you will get.

626
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,330
Coach.

627
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,490
Tell him. No tricks this time.

628
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,880
All right.

629
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,340
Leave before I change
my mind or my mood.

630
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,010
Release them.

631
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,440
Pandit, please.

632
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,690
You were thinking of marrying her
and making babies.

633
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,610
Pal.

634
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,300
I think I just saw

635
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,650
all of us running in tatters.

636
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,720
And people are chasing us angrily.

637
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,300
Shut up, Choocha. Not now.

638
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,450
-I swear...
-Shut up.

639
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,540
I'm telling you, I saw it.

640
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,090
I swear it.

641
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,230
My bum is hurting,
will you put some balm on it?

642
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,330
It's slippery.

643
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,480
"Slackers."

644
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,080
"We are slackers."

645
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,600
"We make even ghosts run away in fear."

646
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,280
"So hold your horses and
watch us in action."

647
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,870
"Slackers."

648
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,480
"We are slackers."

649
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,000
"We make even ghosts run away in fear."

650
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,710
"So hold your horses and
watch us in action."

651
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,090
"Loafers, wastrels!"

652
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,390
"Loafers, wastrels!"

653
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,930
"Loafers, wastrels!"

654
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,430
"Loafers, wastrels!"

655
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,110
"Loafers, wastrels!"

656
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,790
"Loafers, wastrels!"

657
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,430
"Loafers, wastrels!"

658
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,160
"We are perpetually out of luck."

659
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,920
"But we dream big."

660
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,560
"All of them are
million dollar dreams"

661
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,120
"but we own nothing of value."

662
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,720
"We walk the streets of Delhi"

663
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,320
"like emperors."

664
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,920
"We can make people..."

665
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,480
"wet their pants."

666
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,040
"We don't stop till we're done."

667
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,640
"So get out of our way."

668
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,280
"Slackers."

669
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,800
"We are slackers."

670
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,320
"We make even ghosts
run away in fear."

671
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,960
"So hold your horses and
watch us in action."

672
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,600
"Slackers."

673
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,160
"We are slackers."

674
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,680
"We make even ghosts
run away in fear."

675
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,440
"So hold your horses and
watch us in action."

676
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,690
"Loafers, wastrels!"

677
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,030
"Loafers, wastrels!"

678
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,640
"Loafers, wastrels!"

679
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,340
"Loafers, wastrels!"

680
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,950
"Slackers."

681
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,730
"Oh, slackers, you're out of luck."

682
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,850
"You'll soon be paupers."

683
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,160
"You're going to be paupers now."

684
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,080
"Because you're completely out of luck."

685
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,930
Defecating in the bushes...

686
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,050
Defecating leads to...

687
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,010
Poop.

688
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,050
From which we make manure

689
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,730
and manure is used in the fields.

690
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,560
What grows in the fields?

691
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,090
-Harvest...
-Gold.

692
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,940
We make rings of gold.

693
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,330
And these rings have precious stones.

694
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,970
-The most popular of which is...
-Diamond.

695
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,040
So the lottery name is Delhi Diamond.

696
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,600
Now let's consider...

697
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,330
The snake.

698
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,730
The snake is a symbol of Lord Shiva.

699
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,060
And Lord Shiva carries a trident.

700
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,810
He also has a third eye.

701
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,480
So the trident hints at the number three

702
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,730
and so does the third eye.

703
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,080
So the number is clearly...

704
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,800
-Three?
-Three plus three that's six.

705
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,330
Plus three is six.

706
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,610
Should I write?

707
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:46,890
Write.

708
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,750
Delhi Diamond, number 6.

709
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,450
Mr. Brijmohan.

710
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,690
You're going back on your words.

711
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,850
Let me remind you something.

712
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,420
Your position as chief minister

713
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:01,740
is only secure because of my sixteen MLAs.

714
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,570
If you forget this,
then I will take away the support.

715
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,880
Thanks for the reminder,
Mr. Babulal Bhatia.

716
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,280
But my government obeys
only the people.

717
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,520
Not ministers like you.

718
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,810
The people's wishes will be
made clear in the upcoming election.

719
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,010
As for me, listen up.

720
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,650
I will keep supporting
as well as messing with you.

721
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,440
I've got only you to lose,
and all of Delhi to gain.

722
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,120
I left my village with only a penny.

723
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,280
Today, I'm a millionaire.

724
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:31,840
People like you...

725
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:32,940
Hello?

726
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,690
Hey, hello.

727
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,510
Sir, our business...

728
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,870
Were you sleeping till now, idiot?

729
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,690
Who are these guys?

730
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,830
Just...

731
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,720
There are four guys who've opened
a new company.

732
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,340
They've played at lotteries
for a few years.

733
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,230
They didn't get caught earlier
because they dealt in small amounts.

734
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,400
But now they're trying to
bet a very large amount.

735
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:56,890
And you're trying to put yourself
on my seat.

736
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,470
Darling, he needs a sip of water.

737
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,540
Tidda.

738
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,840
Have you too forgotten your boss?

739
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,800
I swear, boss, I gave him
the news in the first place.

740
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,670
It was me that sensed
something with these guys.

741
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,080
Somehow, they get the number by fluke
and get the prize money.

742
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,240
I can get them beaten up if you say so.

743
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:39,010
That'll do no good to me.

744
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,490
Just accept their bets.

745
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:46,440
Let them bet as much
money as they like.

746
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,460
Boss, we'll lose everything then.

747
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,210
-Tidda.
-Yes, boss, okay.

748
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,340
As you say.

749
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:58,090
"All right."

750
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,520
-Bet 18.8 million.
-Bet 14.4 million.

751
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,620
-Bet 1.7 million.
-Bet 16.6 million.

752
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,620
On Delhi Diamond, number six.

753
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,420
-Delhi Diamond, number six.
-Delhi Diamond, number six.

754
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,560
-Number six, Delhi Diamond.
-Yes.

755
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,410
Take the money in advance.

756
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:18,720
Six, number six.
The number six.

757
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,930
Bet 15.5 million.

758
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,210
You know, there's a saying.

759
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,890
If everything is coming your way,

760
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,690
then you're in the wrong lane.

761
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,210
What's wrong in this, Zafar?

762
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,090
Petrol prices are going up
every month.

763
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,870
Inflation is at an all-time high,
and so are people's needs.

764
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,330
The only thing that's cheap

765
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,930
is a person's integrity or one's life.

766
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,960
If this floats someone's boat,
what's the harm?

767
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,360
You send your winnings
to charity anyway.

768
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,600
Then think of this as goodwill
for the Delhi folk

769
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,190
along with getting rid of your debt.

770
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,160
Okay, now move on.

771
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,010
Pandit,

772
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,710
you look like such a nincompoop.

773
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,680
I couldn't believe your wisdom
for a few seconds.

774
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,410
But honestly, you've won my heart.

775
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,400
And Zafar has won mine.

776
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:17,610
That's why I've decided
never to leave you

777
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,690
and I'll come to Goya with you.

778
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,000
What? Where?

779
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,110
Goya.

780
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,520
Where there are beaches,
and dolphins...

781
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,610
Where everyone swims in the ocean.

782
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:31,040
Zafar, did you think
that we forgot your show?

783
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,440
Hey.

784
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,010
It's not just about a show.

785
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,110
Zafar is also getting married there.

786
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,890
What are you saying, Pandit?

787
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,090
Is that true, Zafar?

788
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:43,930
Yes, I was going to tell you about it,

789
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:45,980
but I didn't get a chance.

790
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,390
No worries, Zafar.

791
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,610
We show up at weddings
uninvited all the time.

792
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,300
Just look out for him.

793
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,480
He'll never be a groom,
but he could be your best man.

794
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,630
At least he'll get to
walk down the aisle.

795
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,060
Congratulations.

796
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,440
Sir, there is the pool,
and the garden is over there.

797
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,370
And that is the driveway
connecting to the building.

798
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,490
Wait.

799
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,690
Excuse me, please come.
This side.

800
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,570
Say, how much did they bet?

801
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,240
Boss, it's a large amount on
number six of Delhi Diamond.

802
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,970
If the number hits,
they'll win 800 million.

803
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,370
What shall I do?

804
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,360
Change the lottery number.

805
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:31,530
What?

806
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,830
Change the lottery number, Son.

807
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,010
And enjoy the show.

808
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,690
All right.

809
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,450
Spread word.

810
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,400
Those slackers' company has shut down

811
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,660
and they have made off
with the people's money.

812
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,590
Declare the company
fraudulent immediately.

813
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,370
Okay.

814
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,200
Do you have cell phone reception?

815
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:00,370
-Yes, I do.
-It's been hours.

816
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,570
Why haven't they called yet?

817
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,730
The call will come. Don't worry.

818
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,490
Choocha...

819
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,130
Hello? Which number?

820
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,810
We got the wrong lottery number.

821
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,920
We lost.

822
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,810
"Run."

823
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,290
"Run."

824
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,550
"Run."

825
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,340
"Run."

826
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,480
All right.

827
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,550
-Come on, sir.
-Tidda.

828
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,240
What are the day's profits?

829
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:14,600
Boss, factoring in the bets
from Hunny and Choocha's company

830
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,300
our profit is 11.6 million.

831
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:17,650
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

832
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,610
And how are those smart-alecks doing?

833
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,370
They're in big trouble.

834
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:23,390
People are tearing at them.

835
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,520
They are on the run for their lives.

836
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,810
-Is it?
-Yes.

837
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:29,980
Sir?

838
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,630
This isn't my job.

839
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,560
This shouldn't have happened at all.

840
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:36,430
Politics is my game,
not this petty nonsense.

841
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:43,010
I want to be the chief minister
not a referee.

842
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:44,690
Yes, sir.

843
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,670
-Understood?
-Yes.

844
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,670
"Run."

845
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,050
"Run."

846
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:53,020
Why are you wandering around?

847
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:55,450
First, you tell me who you are.

848
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,550
Turtle okay, elephant okay.

849
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,370
Lion okay, rhino okay.

850
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,690
Donkey?

851
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,350
What will you do with donkeys?

852
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,240
You don't know the use of a donkey?

853
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:10,880
It gives a very good medicine.

854
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,490
Madam. Madam.

855
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,440
How much money have
you lost so far?

856
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:19,810
325,000.

857
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:22,300
Those rascals cheated us.

858
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:25,080
My daughter's wedding is
about to take place in eight days.

859
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,830
I hope Choocha rots in hell.

860
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,520
I need to repair my shanty
for the monsoon.

861
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:32,750
But Lali has cheated me of 125,000.

862
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,720
I curse him.

863
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:37,280
He will be ruined.

864
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,260
According to our sources,
the entire scam involves

865
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:42,640
about 100 million.

866
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:46,160
From doctors to laborers,
all the people in Delhi

867
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,240
have lost their money.

868
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:51,000
Hunny and Choocha, owners
of Hunny-Choocha Dream Factory,

869
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,160
and their partners...

870
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,850
Those clowns!

871
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,310
They run out of luck only
when they work for me.

872
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,450
Behind me.
The guy behind me.

873
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,440
Help him.

874
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:26,910
Hold him.
Hold him from the other side.

875
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,210
Hunny? Hunny?

876
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,450
Hunny.

877
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,250
Lali. Lali.

878
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,370
Pump his chest.

879
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,530
Okay.

880
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:54,680
We'll have to try mouth-to-mouth.

881
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,810
What?

882
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:00,070
Are you crazy, Zafar?

883
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,980
This guy doesn't brush
his teeth for months

884
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:03,940
and you want me to
blow into his mouth.

885
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,450
You're welcome to try it.

886
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,930
But I won't do it.
Let him die if he must.

887
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,510
You imbecile.

888
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,840
I was saving this French kiss
for Bholi.

889
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,510
But you stole it.

890
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,100
Oh, God.

891
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,960
You've blown your dirty breath
into my lungs.

892
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,200
I feel like throwing up.

893
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,080
You overweight shrimp.

894
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,150
Buy some toothpaste.

895
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,370
Your breath is even worse than mine.

896
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,780
Is he for real?

897
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:09,920
"My heart is crazy about love."

898
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:16,730
"I know how to burn myself in love."

899
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:21,370
"It's difficult for you
to escape, my love."

900
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,610
Mister,

901
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,570
can I borrow your phone?

902
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:29,320
"My heart is crazy about love."

903
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,710
"My heart is crazy about love."

904
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:36,070
Hey, is anyone going to sleep here?

905
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:39,250
"Loafers, wastrels!"

906
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,980
"Loafers, wastrels!"

907
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,510
"Loafers, wastrels!"

908
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,240
"Loafers, wastrels!"

909
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:45,930
"Loafers, wastrels!"

910
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,610
"Loafers, wastrels!".

911
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,220
"Loafers, wastrels!"

912
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,900
"Loafers, wastrels!"

913
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,450
Hello, Pandit? This is Zafar here.

914
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,690
"Loafers, wastrels!"

915
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:04,360
"Loafers, wastrels!"

916
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:06,040
"Loafers, wastrels!"

917
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,590
"Loafers, wastrels!"

918
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,500
"Loafers, wastrels!"

919
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:11,150
"Loafers, wastrels!"

920
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:12,950
"Loafers, wastrels!"

921
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:20,940
Hey, dude.

922
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:24,050
Are you mad?
It's really hot.

923
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,560
Here, 4000 rupees.

924
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:31,300
Don't say a word to anyone.

925
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,150
All right.

926
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:40,190
"That's it, I'm off.
Keep me in your prayers."

927
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,760
"Talk about me once in a while..."

928
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,050
Yes?

929
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,530
Who are you?

930
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,340
I'm just like that.

931
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:50,880
-What do you mean?
-How do I explain?

932
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,930
You know, just like that.

933
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,560
Dude, he's with me.

934
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:57,110
He's a friend.

935
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,250
So you're with them?

936
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,630
I'll charge double for him.

937
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:03,970
Why?

938
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,210
You know...

939
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,970
Just like that.

940
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:14,940
Arrogance.

941
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,950
How is everything out there, Pandit?

942
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:27,050
Billa has lost his mind.

943
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,730
He is defending his shop
with a sword.

944
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:38,830
Delhi Police and the public
are looking for you.

945
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:40,700
I mean, they're looking for your bodies.

946
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:42,980
They think you drowned in the river.

947
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:49,920
What about Neetu and Priya?

948
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:52,550
They were distraught when
they heard about the drowning.

949
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:54,890
But I told them

950
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:56,520
that you are alive.

951
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:59,560
True love never dies.

952
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:05,280
Bholi must also be very
worried about me.

953
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,700
Do you think so?

954
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,680
She's in deep mourning.

955
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:14,410
-Oh, really?
-Shut up.

956
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:17,600
How did we get the wrong
lottery number?

957
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,420
That's what I'm trying to...

958
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:28,670
-Bro, did you again...
-No, pal. No, Hunny.

959
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,350
The dream was real.
I swear to God.

960
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,980
Dude, I don't trust him.

961
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:35,640
Argue as much as you like.

962
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:38,330
Make your funeral arrangements
as well, while you're at it.

963
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,470
We are no more.

964
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,700
Oh Lord, please save us.

965
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:43,010
Lali...

966
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:54,460
Hunny, I just saw something.

967
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:56,080
Great, he's gone crazy again.

968
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:58,400
No, really. I just saw something.

969
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:02,000
This is just a ruse to go to
an asylum instead of jail.

970
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,070
-Pandit, believe me...
-What did you see?

971
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,130
Dude.

972
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,620
Dude, I saw

973
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:11,480
a giant tiger in a big cave

974
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:14,390
with two demons standing there.

975
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:19,290
And there were large boxes and chests
full of treasure.

976
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:23,330
-That's what I just saw.
-Hunny, please. Please.

977
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:24,630
This is not a dream.

978
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,400
Exactly. This is not a dream.

979
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:28,100
And this isn't the first time.

980
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:31,130
-This is the same ruse for asylum...
-Enough now, Pandit.

981
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,560
Lali, do you remember?

982
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:35,770
When the snake bit him,
and the fever drove him nuts?

983
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,270
He's still equally nuts.

984
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,920
In fact, he's even crazier.

985
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:41,110
Just answer the question, man.

986
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,390
He told me to move, because
the flying saucer would fall.

987
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,300
The fan fell on the spot,
right as I moved, remember?

988
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:48,140
Yes, you could've died.

989
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:49,670
And the other day at Bholi's.

990
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,960
There he saw people running
after us angrily.

991
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:54,800
And we all know what
happened yesterday.

992
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,820
One minute, what are you
trying to say?

993
00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:01,100
Just that Choocha said
the fan would fall, and it fell.

994
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:04,050
He said people would run
after us, and they did.

995
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,680
And now he says there's a tiger...

996
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:08,750
With two demons in a cave,
with a real treasure.

997
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,780
Yes, it is real, because
he has seen it.

998
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:15,000
Zafar, I think he is in shock.

999
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,010
Let it be, Hunny. They don't
know anything about science.

1000
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,710
They won't understand.

1001
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,610
Pandit, this is called "déjà chu".

1002
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,460
Not "déjà chu", idiot.
It's déjà vu.

1003
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:27,950
It's happened to me, so
we'll call it "déjà chu", get it?

1004
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,700
It's not déjà vu.

1005
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,000
Premonition.
This is a premonition.

1006
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:34,060
What's that?

1007
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:36,500
It's when one can see things
in the future...

1008
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:39,540
Wait, you mean Choocha
can see the future?

1009
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:43,620
No, not the future, but some
events from the immediate future.

1010
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:45,940
People see one-off
incidents sometimes.

1011
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,490
Mostly related to them.
This much is true.

1012
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:51,780
Zafar, I just don't get it.

1013
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,790
Pandit, it isn't necessary
for us to understand everything.

1014
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,420
All our lives, we try to fit
everything in our understanding.

1015
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:01,850
If we grasp something, it is true,
otherwise, we think it is impossible.

1016
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,420
We meant well. We didn't
want to harm anyone.

1017
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:07,860
God saw us in trouble
and gave us a new gift.

1018
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,700
And one shouldn't question
or doubt God's gifts.

1019
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:18,470
There, that's God's first signal.

1020
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:32,820
"We are slackers."

1021
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,310
Bro, that's the zoo.

1022
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,300
"We make even ghosts run away in fear."

1023
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,380
Changu, use both hands.

1024
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,990
Catch him.

1025
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,990
The cub's mother is angry.

1026
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,660
Corner it now.

1027
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:20,390
There, we've almost got him.

1028
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,900
Shh, quietly...

1029
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,940
-To the corner...
-From the other side...

1030
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:38,190
-Open the gate, quickly.
-Wait, I'll open it.

1031
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:57,070
That means the treasure is real.

1032
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,660
So, now what?

1033
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:03,790
Well, we've found the tiger.
Now we find the rest of it.

1034
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:05,700
No matter what happens

1035
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,290
this stays between the five of us.

1036
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:09,980
This goes especially to you.

1037
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:12,320
I swear on your mom, pal.
I won't say a word.

1038
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,220
Take it quickly.

1039
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:16,380
-Quickly...
-Good, good.

1040
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:18,340
Ma'am Bholi will be very happy. Take this.

1041
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:19,590
We'll need more later.

1042
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:22,950
Let's go.

1043
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,900
Three million, okay.

1044
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:56,030
Let go of me. Please let go of me.

1045
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:00,660
Bholi, where are they taking me?

1046
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:03,140
I'll pay you back, please
don't gouge my eyes out.

1047
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:04,380
No, silly.

1048
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:06,260
Not your eyes,
they'll take your kidney.

1049
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,250
You owe me 2.8 million
with interest, right?

1050
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,540
And your kidney will sell
for three million.

1051
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:12,740
So the balance is yours.

1052
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:14,580
See, this is a profitable deal for you.

1053
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:17,510
No, please let go of me.
I'll pay you back.

1054
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,220
No.

1055
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:22,550
Right then, boy.

1056
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,460
Let's start by gouging out your eyes.

1057
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:25,780
You have such pretty eyes.

1058
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,820
Miss Bholi, please. Not my eyes.

1059
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:30,150
I haven't even seen
the world properly yet.

1060
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:32,250
Have you seen the movie 3 Idiots?

1061
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,420
-Yes.
-That's enough.

1062
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,460
Wait, what's going on?

1063
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:38,490
You keep herding us here like sheep.

1064
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,860
The people of Delhi are after us
because of your plan.

1065
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:42,780
And now you're disemboweling us.

1066
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:44,780
Zafar warned you, didn't he?

1067
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,740
Your plan failed, we didn't screw up.

1068
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:48,260
Calm down, captain.

1069
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,780
If you thought the plan was bad,
why did you jump at it?

1070
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:52,420
You think I don't know you?

1071
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:55,800
I don't care whose fault it is.

1072
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:57,140
Bobby boy,

1073
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:59,820
take these five men.
One kidney and two eyes each.

1074
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,980
Three million per eye,
and five million for the kidney.

1075
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:04,760
-Sell it and recover the debit balance.
-No, Miss Bholi, please.

1076
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:06,880
Lali, you scare too easily, man.

1077
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:09,540
Nothing will happen, believe me.

1078
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:11,740
Look. First, they'll give you
chloroform.

1079
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:13,580
Then right here... Look at me.

1080
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:15,550
They'll slice right here
on the stomach...

1081
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:26,460
I saw something again.

1082
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:28,130
I saw

1083
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:32,330
a bag of cranberry juice
was hanging on a stand.

1084
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:35,780
There was an oxygen mask
on that man's face...

1085
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:38,590
And in the doctor's hand

1086
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:42,260
there was an X-ray report
with only one kidney.

1087
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,260
His kidney... Not his kidney.

1088
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:47,630
Don't take his kidney, Bholi.
He has only one kidney he'll die.

1089
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:49,460
Don't take his kidney.

1090
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:51,590
But his kidney...

1091
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,940
Bholi, Bholi...

1092
01:03:59,070 --> 01:03:59,940
Please forgive me.

1093
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:03,580
Please don't take my kidney.
My heart will fail if you do.

1094
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:05,420
I have some news for you instead.

1095
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,460
Pandit, don't be afraid.

1096
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:09,100
We'll talk it out peacefully.

1097
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:10,380
Have you lost it?

1098
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:11,940
I told you to keep this a secret.

1099
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:15,940
Dude, what is the secret worth
if she takes your organs?

1100
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:18,740
I want no tricks, speak clearly.

1101
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:20,940
-It's nothing.
-I'll tell you.

1102
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:24,060
It might sound outlandish,
but this Choocha...

1103
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:27,180
All the bizarre quirks in the
universe happen to him.

1104
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:29,540
He is now able to see the future.

1105
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:32,340
He can see events that
haven't happened yet.

1106
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:35,350
Zafar, what is it called?
Prem Permission...

1107
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:41,790
Don't look at me like that.
Trust me. Please believe me.

1108
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:43,620
Ask them if you want to.

1109
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:46,060
Everything Choocha sees comes true.

1110
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:48,900
Don't you guys get tired?

1111
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:51,700
You always cook up some
peculiar theory or the other.

1112
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,460
Listen up, shape shifter.

1113
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,020
I'll call Paul the Octopus

1114
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:58,060
-if I want to see my future.
-Okay.

1115
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:00,350
Save Choocha's gift
for your birthday.

1116
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:03,260
Listen, handsome. Start with
this old man first.

1117
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:05,220
Take out all his body parts,
except for his brain and his tongue.

1118
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:06,860
Bholi, it's true.
Choocha has seen it.

1119
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:09,980
He saw a tiger in a cave with two demons
and Mughal treasure.

1120
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:12,660
-That's enough for now.
-It isn't unbelievable.

1121
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:14,500
No just Choocha, anybody
could have premonitions.

1122
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:15,510
Even you.

1123
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,300
Google it if you want to.

1124
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,100
I've seen it.

1125
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:22,940
That's why I'm removing them, so you
can't spew such nonsense again.

1126
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,380
Madam, you're making a big mistake.

1127
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:26,860
You might as well have killed us earlier.

1128
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:28,550
Sorry for the delay.

1129
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:30,980
-Bholi, I have kids.
-Let go of me.

1130
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:33,150
Let go of me.

1131
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:35,330
If you're thinking about the treasure,
then forget about it.

1132
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,920
That's impossible right now.

1133
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,360
Why?

1134
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:40,970
Everybody thinks we are dead.

1135
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:44,090
We'll get caught if we go out
looking for the treasure.

1136
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,890
People might even kill us in anger.

1137
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:49,600
And if we die
you will never get the treasure.

1138
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:51,730
And you don't need me to tell you

1139
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,360
how valuable the treasure
could be on the international market.

1140
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,560
So you want me to dig up the city
with a hammer and spade?

1141
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:58,790
No, madam.

1142
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:01,370
If you want the treasure,

1143
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,320
then buy us our freedom.

1144
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,540
How?

1145
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:06,850
How?

1146
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:11,570
How?

1147
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:13,890
Choocha, shh.

1148
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:18,290
Sometimes I wonder
how she runs her empire.

1149
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:19,760
What do you think, Bobby?

1150
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:24,810
Zafar, tell her how.

1151
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:32,260
We owe the people 84 million.

1152
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:35,490
Pay them their money,
and we'll look for the treasure.

1153
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:37,230
And as soon as we find it,
it's yours.

1154
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,810
Half yours, half ours.
50/50.

1155
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:42,010
That's how.

1156
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:43,890
She wants to know how!

1157
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:46,460
Scratch properly, Pandit.

1158
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:48,370
I am doing that.

1159
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:55,810
Mom.

1160
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:57,400
Mom.

1161
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,400
God has answered our prayers.

1162
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:01,270
We don't have to call off the wedding.

1163
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:02,920
Mom.

1164
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:05,050
My wedding won't have
to be called off.

1165
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,800
I received a call saying
we will get our money back.

1166
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:13,600
Praise the Almighty.

1167
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:34,340
Boss, I've just found out.

1168
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,720
All four boys are alive,
and they're with Bholi.

1169
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:40,090
Bholi is returning everyone's
money on their behalf.

1170
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:46,420
Madam.

1171
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:47,620
Madam.

1172
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:50,640
Recovery total is 23.3 million.

1173
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:54,130
Mrs. Bhalla booked two eyes,
but bought only one.

1174
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:11,160
Yes, Mr. Bhatia.

1175
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,350
People are usually worthless when alive.

1176
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,110
How could the dead be
worth anything, Bholi?

1177
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:20,720
But you must have a reason
for placing value on the dead.

1178
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,330
What you need to do
is send those boys over to me.

1179
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,960
Ask for anything but them,
I'll give it to you.

1180
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:30,090
Why?

1181
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,770
Have you decided to become their consort?

1182
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:34,130
Listen to me.

1183
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,080
Send them to me, or break your promise.

1184
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,570
It's up to you.

1185
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:06,440
-Ah, you've arrived?
-No, we haven't.

1186
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,680
-First tell us what is going on.
-All of us, here...

1187
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,050
And how is Mr. Bhatia involved?

1188
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:13,330
He'll explain everything himself.
Don't worry.

1189
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:15,300
-Please, take care of them.
-Of course, sir.

1190
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:17,010
Come, come.

1191
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:18,640
Please.

1192
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,430
See you later.

1193
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:23,110
Greetings, welcome to The Roseate.

1194
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,290
This way, please.

1195
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:27,350
Do you think they'll feed us?

1196
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:29,420
Excuse me.

1197
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:32,950
No, ma'am, we don't want a credit card.

1198
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:36,630
That's not a credit card,
it's your room key, sir.

1199
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:40,510
What?

1200
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,390
What did you say?

1201
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:45,740
This is the first time in
my life someone has called me sir.

1202
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:46,820
Did you see that?

1203
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:49,380
Ma'am, please do me a favor.

1204
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:52,500
I haven't bathed in two days,
and I'm sticky all over.

1205
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:56,470
Please arrange some soap,
shampoo, oil and towel slippers.

1206
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:58,430
What, sir?

1207
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:00,180
Towel slippers.

1208
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:01,840
Yes, yes, let's go.

1209
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:06,030
If this is the key,
imagine what the lock is like.

1210
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,430
Now, what does Babulal want from us?

1211
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:17,810
What could we possibly give him?

1212
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:24,690
Do you think Babulal is a homo?
Like Amit from school?

1213
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,560
I've heard some politicians
are fond of young boys.

1214
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:36,940
Yes?

1215
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:38,710
Sir, Mr. Babulal has asked for you.

1216
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,870
See. Didn't I tell you?

1217
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:45,730
Lali, you go first.

1218
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,870
No way. I won't go alone.

1219
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:49,830
He's asked for all of you.

1220
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:51,570
-All of us?
-Yes.

1221
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,190
-Together?
-Yes, sir.

1222
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,390
Here, Son.

1223
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,260
Here, Son.

1224
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:13,060
-I'm vegetarian.
-Okay, okay.

1225
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:14,670
Then take this.

1226
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,810
Sir, may I say something?

1227
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:21,300
Speak your mind fearlessly, Son.

1228
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,910
-Sir, I've heard...
-Uncle, where is Aunt?

1229
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:31,460
What, why are you staring at me?

1230
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:33,670
She is nowhere to be seen, so I asked him.

1231
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,100
I just wanted to clear things up.

1232
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:38,390
In case, like Amit from school,
you're also a...

1233
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:42,660
You've wet the whole chicken.

1234
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:44,180
I'll have to dry it up now.

1235
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:52,150
-Sir, I've heard that...
-Hold on, dear.

1236
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,690
What's your name, dear?

1237
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:56,910
Choocha.

1238
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:58,230
Choocha.

1239
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,350
That makes sense.

1240
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:03,310
What were you saying?

1241
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:07,980
I've heard that politicians don't
even spare a thought for free.

1242
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,510
You've heard right.

1243
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:12,740
So what do you want from us
in return for this hospitality?

1244
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:14,070
I want you to make me a promise.

1245
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:16,630
A promise.

1246
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:18,070
Have some more, dear.

1247
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:20,070
-One more.
-Sure.

1248
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:21,510
Please.

1249
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:26,990
Do you know our nation's
greatest strength?

1250
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:30,350
Youth. It's young population.

1251
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:34,660
When I see lost young men like you...

1252
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:36,670
It causes me great pain.

1253
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:41,690
Boys, this world works
on a give-and-take basis.

1254
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,470
But people only focus on the take.

1255
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:47,950
I know the problem you boys are in.

1256
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:52,030
If I want, I could solve all
your troubles in a day.

1257
01:14:52,770 --> 01:14:56,190
But in return, you must make me a promise.

1258
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,900
Sir, please get us out of this mess.

1259
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:02,700
Take as many promises
as you like in return.

1260
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:03,860
Then promise me

1261
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:06,700
that you will apologize
to the people openly

1262
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:10,070
and you will avoid all
shady businesses henceforth.

1263
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:13,700
Promise me you'll work hard and
uphold the country's pride.

1264
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:16,680
You'll be an example for other youth.

1265
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,740
If you make me this solemn promise,

1266
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:22,500
then tomorrow I will return
the people of Delhi

1267
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:24,950
every penny of their lost money.

1268
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:29,260
There will be no police
or court cases involved.

1269
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,910
Uncle Nehru.

1270
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,620
"Walk on the path of justice."

1271
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:47,230
"It will lead you to righteousness."

1272
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:51,060
"Be a strong voice for the nation."

1273
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:55,010
"Do your country proud."

1274
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:56,900
"Walk on the right path..."

1275
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:58,630
Uncle Nehru.

1276
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,710
You've finally come to meet
your dear Choocha.

1277
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:06,060
You have no idea how much
I've read about you.

1278
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:07,550
I always told Mummy

1279
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,860
that you would surely come one day.

1280
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:11,550
-Choocha.
-Thank you, Uncle.

1281
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:13,390
-Uncle Nehru.
-Leave him, Choocha.

1282
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:20,380
So...

1283
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:22,030
Is that a promise?

1284
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:41,980
Glory to Mother India.

1285
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:44,430
Glory to Mother India.

1286
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:51,830
Excuse me, madam.

1287
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:53,270
Where are you going?

1288
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:57,130
Pandit, it's you.

1289
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:58,790
Male to female?.

1290
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:01,120
Male, female...
Can't go into detail.

1291
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,990
Just take me to madam.

1292
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,180
Come, come.

1293
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:10,450
Bholi, sometimes you live up to your name.

1294
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:13,590
I can't believe you could be so naive.

1295
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:16,510
I mean, maybe you didn't notice...

1296
01:17:16,990 --> 01:17:18,460
I'm in a bad mood, Pandit.

1297
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:20,350
-Don't talk in riddles.
-Okay.

1298
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:23,750
Do you know who runs
the lottery business in Delhi?

1299
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:25,660
Tidda, of course.

1300
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:27,510
And who is Tidda's father?

1301
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:34,710
Tidda's father?

1302
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:37,870
Wasn't his mother a prostitute?
I'm not sure...

1303
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:46,070
May I give you some
personal advice?

1304
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:49,300
Stay away from Choocha at any cost.

1305
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:50,950
Not good for health.

1306
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,590
He's a virus.

1307
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,340
I can see his influence here.

1308
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:57,340
By father, I mean his boss.

1309
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:59,540
And Tidda's boss is Babulal Bhatia.

1310
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:02,690
He owns all the lottery dens
on the Delhi border.

1311
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:06,610
Nonsense, I know Babulal Bhatia
inside out.

1312
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:08,300
-I know all his businesses.
-Ah.

1313
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:10,580
No wonder he fooled you.

1314
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:13,580
He changed the lottery number as soon as
he heard about the Dream Factory.

1315
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:15,880
This is the truth, I guarantee it.

1316
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:18,340
Pandit, if this is some trick...

1317
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:20,030
No, no, Miss Bholi...

1318
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:21,430
Look at me.

1319
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:24,470
Do I look like I can afford
to play tricks on you?

1320
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,410
God bless Noor Bano

1321
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:29,130
who gave me her burqa
along with this news.

1322
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:30,540
-Noor Bano?
-Yes.

1323
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:32,660
-From the red light area?
-Yes.

1324
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,550
She was once Babulal's masseuse,

1325
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,140
but she now runs a brothel.

1326
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:37,470
Look, Bholi.

1327
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,230
Babulal rigging the lottery makes sense.

1328
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:44,190
But then he took the boys
from right under your nose.

1329
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:46,550
Wonder why.

1330
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:50,430
Did he find out about the treasure?

1331
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:55,760
Pandit, go to them immediately

1332
01:18:55,890 --> 01:18:57,900
and tell the captain about
the minister's deceit.

1333
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:00,540
And remind them that no matter what...

1334
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:01,670
No matter what.

1335
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:05,020
Babulal Bhatia should not
find out about the treasure.

1336
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:06,220
I'll take care of the rest.

1337
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:08,880
Not me, madam, people are
baying for my blood.

1338
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:10,470
How can I go there?

1339
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:12,850
I'll tell you how.

1340
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:28,340
"Come on, rap with me."

1341
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,760
"The whole floor will tap with me."

1342
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,030
"You know, everyone calls me Pandit."

1343
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:36,290
"Spinning the tail as good as ghee."

1344
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:39,990
850 rupees for the curry.

1345
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:42,580
2300 rupees for Butter chicken.

1346
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:45,300
-Bro, let's go out.
-Shut up.

1347
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:46,790
Don't even think about it.

1348
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:49,140
We'll only go out once we are free.

1349
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:51,500
But take a look at it.
There's a wedding reception.

1350
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:52,930
Some actresses have also come.

1351
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,550
Please, dude, just once...

1352
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:58,450
"You're my best friend, after all."

1353
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,710
No, no.

1354
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,780
"You're my best friend, after all."

1355
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:10,540
-Hello, room service?
-No, sir, this is the reception.

1356
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:14,010
Oh. May I ask why you haven't
invited us to the reception?

1357
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:21,700
Sir, this is the reception desk.

1358
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:24,540
-The wedding reception is on the lawns.
-Oh no...

1359
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:27,790
Two receptions in the same hotel.
No wonder I got confused.

1360
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:29,830
Sorry, sir.

1361
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:31,270
It's okay.

1362
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:32,870
Do you have binacalculators?

1363
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:34,230
What, sir?

1364
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:36,170
Binacalculators.

1365
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:39,050
No, sir, we don't have that.

1366
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:45,070
Virus.

1367
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:47,190
What's wrong with the guy in 04?

1368
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,820
Oil, slippers...

1369
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:50,670
What's binacalculators now?

1370
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,270
Binoculars.

1371
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,550
-Sorry, sir?
-Nothing.

1372
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:57,590
Is 05 vacant?

1373
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,790
"Loafers, wastrels!"

1374
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,450
"Loafers, wastrels!"

1375
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,170
"Loafers, wastrels!"

1376
01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:04,770
"Loafers, wastrels!"

1377
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,420
CBI. It's the CBI, bro.

1378
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:09,150
It's a CBI raid. Run.

1379
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:11,630
"Loafers, wastrels!"

1380
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:21,180
Pandit, is that you?

1381
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,090
Yes, it's me.

1382
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:25,110
May I come in?

1383
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,350
"Loafers, wastrels!"

1384
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:45,060
So Bholi hasn't told Babulal
about the treasure.

1385
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:46,110
She hasn't.

1386
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,270
One minute.

1387
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:49,130
I hope you guys didn't tell him, either.

1388
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:54,010
Then what does he want?

1389
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,190
I can't believe it...

1390
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:09,710
What?

1391
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,630
Elections.

1392
01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:16,290
Babulal doesn't care about
our freedom or social service.

1393
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,150
He just wants to become a
messiah for the people of Delhi

1394
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,590
and win the upcoming elections.

1395
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,620
And maybe, become the chief minister.

1396
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:26,620
Not maybe, Zafar, you are
absolutely correct.

1397
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:29,300
One moment, he'll set you free,
but the next, he'll drag you back.

1398
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:30,710
He's a rascal.

1399
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:37,860
My father often says, "Son,

1400
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:41,950
a man's strength lies in his backbone.

1401
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:46,470
And if the backbone
becomes weak or breaks,

1402
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:50,390
then there is no difference
between a live man and a corpse."

1403
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:53,430
-Pandit.
-Yes?

1404
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:55,990
Dial Bholi's number, please.

1405
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:00,870
It's ringing.

1406
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:06,540
-Bholi? This is Hunny speaking.
-Tell me.

1407
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:09,130
I'll tell you. Grab a pen and paper.

1408
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:20,060
We are reporting from
Babulal Bhatia's press conference

1409
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:21,940
where people are arriving in droves.

1410
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:23,740
A massive crowd has now gathered.

1411
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:26,180
In a time where the country
is plagued by corruption,

1412
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:28,940
there is still a generous politician
like Babulal Bhatia

1413
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:33,070
who is returning the people's
lost money from his pocket.

1414
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:36,940
Long live Babulal Bhatia.
Long live Babulal Bhatia.

1415
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:40,770
Long live Babulal Bhatia.
Long live Babulal Bhatia.

1416
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:44,490
Long live Babulal Bhatia.
Long live Babulal Bhatia.

1417
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:48,330
Long live Babulal Bhatia.
Long live Babulal Bhatia.

1418
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:50,900
Long live Babulal Bhatia.
Long live Babulal Bhatia.

1419
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,670
Please sit, boys.

1420
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:57,620
Long live Babulal Bhatia.
Long live Babulal Bhatia.

1421
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,780
Long live Babulal Bhatia.

1422
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:05,390
I, your humble servant,
Babulal Bhatia,

1423
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:08,940
welcome everybody assembled here

1424
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:10,780
wholeheartedly.

1425
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:18,510
Tell me, madam.

1426
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:19,880
What can I help you with?

1427
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:21,790
Babulal Bhatia.

1428
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:38,070
That's right.

1429
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:46,810
It's a simple matter.

1430
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:49,350
Naxalites,

1431
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:51,630
mafia leaders,

1432
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:53,590
or even terrorists.

1433
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:57,270
All of them get a chance to reform.

1434
01:24:57,590 --> 01:25:00,550
They get a chance to
lay down their weapons.

1435
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:04,110
These are still just four
lost young men.

1436
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:06,270
They are the future of the nation.

1437
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:08,660
That is why, I believe

1438
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:12,550
that even they should get
another chance.

1439
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:25,190
Without wasting much time

1440
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:28,580
I ask the guilty young men

1441
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:30,340
to apologize to you.

1442
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:31,630
Praise the Lord.

1443
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:34,790
Come on. Go ahead.

1444
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,920
People Progress Party

1445
01:25:46,990 --> 01:25:50,950
We are both ashamed
and happy at our actions.

1446
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:57,590
Ashamed, because we caused
a lot of trouble for all of you.

1447
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:00,710
And happy

1448
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:04,000
because we got to know a great man
like Babulal Bhatia

1449
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:05,380
in just one night.

1450
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:09,180
Long live Babulal Bhatia.
Long live Babulal Bhatia.

1451
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:11,140
Long live Babulal Bhatia.

1452
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:13,630
The only reason

1453
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:16,230
we stand before you today is him.

1454
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:21,100
He not only reminded us of our power

1455
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:23,820
but also opened our eyes
to the idea of give-and-take.

1456
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:24,820
And he taught us...

1457
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:27,470
And Hunny opened my eyes.

1458
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:30,260
That is why we want to apologize
for one more thing.

1459
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:31,390
Choocha...

1460
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,540
You see, we drove Hunny's
odd-numbered car

1461
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:36,830
on a day designated for
even numbers only.

1462
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:38,910
So I request Mr. Bhatia

1463
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:42,220
to add a fine of 2000 to
the amount of 100 million.

1464
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:43,710
Thank you, love you all.

1465
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:45,380
Sure, sure.

1466
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:49,430
Long live Babulal Bhatia.
Long live Babulal Bhatia.

1467
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:53,530
Long live Babulal Bhatia.
Long live Babulal Bhatia.

1468
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:31,690
Welcome

1469
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:37,460
Here you go, Son.

1470
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:39,540
I have fulfilled my promise.

1471
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:41,470
Don't forget your promise.

1472
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:45,430
Sir, we will always remember
what you have done with us.

1473
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:47,310
And we hope

1474
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:49,670
you won't forget us either.

1475
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:57,060
Goodbye.

1476
01:27:57,190 --> 01:27:58,420
-Sir, this side.
-Please, sir...

1477
01:27:58,550 --> 01:27:59,470
Goodbye.

1478
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,590
Goodbye.

1479
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:02,340
-Excuse me, sir.
-Mr. Bhatia, this way.

1480
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:04,340
-One more shot, sir.
-This side...

1481
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:06,020
Sir, excuse me, sir.

1482
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:07,510
Sir, just one more question.

1483
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:11,580
-Hello?
-Hello, yes?

1484
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:13,140
-What, a police raid?
-Hello?

1485
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:14,980
-Where? Are you sure?
-Really?

1486
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:16,940
-I'll reach there.
-Okay, okay.

1487
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:21,840
"They are the Rambos of their street."

1488
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:24,950
"It doesn't matter
what people say to them."

1489
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,350
The police have raided
Tidda's den, sir.

1490
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:28,520
In fact, they've raided all
the lottery dens.

1491
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:30,270
"Let them be."

1492
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:34,180
"Let them soak themselves
in the surroundings."

1493
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:37,050
"Come on, check them out."

1494
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:49,350
"They're slackers."

1495
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,660
"They're slackers."

1496
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:33,110
Go inside.

1497
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,670
The media may have cleared you

1498
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:43,860
but you'll end up in jail some day.

1499
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:45,860
Leave us alone

1500
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,950
and forget Priya.

1501
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:11,110
"I'm lost on the path"

1502
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:15,840
"that leads to finding myself."

1503
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:22,950
"I'm lost in my own distress"

1504
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:26,650
"and in unknown dreams."

1505
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:30,300
"Where do I hide the treasure"

1506
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:32,780
"of all these memories?"

1507
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:35,620
"What do I do"

1508
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:38,190
"with these uncontrollable tears?"

1509
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,940
"I want to pour my heart out..."

1510
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:42,950
Sorry, Daddy.

1511
01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:46,270
I am sorry, Son.

1512
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:48,010
It's all my fault.

1513
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:51,900
"Let the night pass..."

1514
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:54,830
If you're ashamed of being
a sweet maker's son,

1515
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:56,990
then let's change that.

1516
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:00,700
Do whatever you like

1517
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:03,300
but don't do anything illegal.

1518
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:05,630
Never do anything illegal.

1519
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,540
"The morning will be beautiful."

1520
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:09,780
Like father, like son.

1521
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:11,660
Go hang out more with that vagabond Hunny.

1522
01:31:12,230 --> 01:31:13,460
Police, crime...

1523
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:15,710
You've dragged us into
such a mess...

1524
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:18,230
Look at that.

1525
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,550
Speak of the devil, and here he is.

1526
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,230
Here...

1527
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:25,190
I beg of you.
Leave us alone.

1528
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:27,230
Let my son be.

1529
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:29,230
I don't know about your family.

1530
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:32,470
But because of you,
he has tarnished our reputation.

1531
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:42,830
"Let the night pass..."

1532
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:45,270
As if we were very honorable
to begin with.

1533
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:47,020
-Hunny, wait.
-Come back

1534
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:49,650
or I'll make sure you
never forget your manners.

1535
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:52,030
You keep changing the light bulb.

1536
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:54,530
Fools, all of them...

1537
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:58,210
"There will be a morning."

1538
01:32:04,430 --> 01:32:05,470
Listen.

1539
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:07,470
Your mother is right.

1540
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:09,910
Stop hanging around me.

1541
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:13,480
Would you stop if your
mom told you that?

1542
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:16,820
Mothers don't know about
our friendship.

1543
01:32:16,950 --> 01:32:18,550
They'll never understand.

1544
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:20,020
They aren't wrong,

1545
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:21,630
but neither are we.

1546
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:24,580
And it's not me.

1547
01:32:24,710 --> 01:32:26,110
But you, who hangs around me.

1548
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:34,030
May I ask you something?

1549
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:38,070
Why did you have the
lottery dens raided?

1550
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:41,100
With the lottery, our status
in college is also finished.

1551
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:44,660
Remember, you once said,

1552
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:47,340
"What if one day I
stop seeing dreams?

1553
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:49,030
What will we do then?"

1554
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:51,750
Yes.

1555
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,430
Then what did I say?

1556
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:57,770
You must've hit me, for sure.

1557
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,270
Yes, I did,

1558
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:00,500
but I also said

1559
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:02,780
that once this gift runs its course

1560
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:05,550
God will give us
a new gift automatically.

1561
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:06,920
And that's what happened.

1562
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:08,990
Exactly. Let the college status go.

1563
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:10,700
We'll build it again.

1564
01:33:10,830 --> 01:33:12,400
Bro, you've got a harsh tongue.

1565
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:15,110
But you're soft at heart.

1566
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:21,140
Dude.
It's Changu and Mangu.

1567
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:22,990
We're done for if they catch us.

1568
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:27,980
Choocha, it's me.

1569
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:29,430
I'm not Choocha.

1570
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:32,290
You?

1571
01:33:33,670 --> 01:33:35,020
How did you know that we are here?

1572
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:38,140
Bro, an addict is found
at one of two places,

1573
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:39,590
the den or jail.

1574
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:41,420
We didn't go to jail,

1575
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:43,120
so we thought you would be
here at the zoo.

1576
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:45,550
We started all this together.

1577
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:47,270
We'll get through it together.

1578
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,960
"That's our life's philosophy, bro."

1579
01:33:50,090 --> 01:33:52,420
"Even if life is in the pits,
we'll make do."

1580
01:33:52,550 --> 01:33:54,670
"We'll find a way out together"

1581
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,280
"even if we're completely broke."

1582
01:33:57,620 --> 01:34:01,370
"You're my best friend, after all."

1583
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:03,000
Guys, shall I leave?

1584
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:07,230
"You're my best friend, after all."

1585
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:16,530
Zafar, we aren't completely free yet.

1586
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:18,750
We still have to deal with Bholi.

1587
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,370
And she won't let us live in peace
until we find the treasure.

1588
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:22,990
Even if she is sent to jail.

1589
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:24,590
I know.

1590
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:26,350
It's not just about Bholi.

1591
01:34:26,850 --> 01:34:28,660
If the minister finds out

1592
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:30,230
about what we did to him...

1593
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:32,790
What are we waiting for then?

1594
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:34,380
Not like this.

1595
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:35,980
We have to figure out the riddle first.

1596
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:40,870
The tigress is here,
let's start with the cave.

1597
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:43,260
Which cave? Where is it?

1598
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:45,230
There are thousands of tunnels in Delhi.

1599
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:48,530
Man, this is even more
complicated than the dream.

1600
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:51,550
Maybe another dream?

1601
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,650
I mean, premonition.

1602
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:32,730
Curses on all of you.

1603
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:35,210
When I'm not sleepy
you force me to sleep.

1604
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:37,680
When I am sleepy
you dip my fingers in hot tea.

1605
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:39,120
We have no time to sleep.

1606
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:40,860
Tell us where the cave is.

1607
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:42,970
Up my arse.

1608
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:44,640
Come find the treasure.

1609
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:47,920
He is still so vulgar.

1610
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:49,830
Let me go to the toilet.

1611
01:35:50,130 --> 01:35:51,290
Lali, go with him.

1612
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:52,780
He'll fall asleep inside.

1613
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:55,340
Let me at least poop
in peace, dude.

1614
01:35:55,470 --> 01:35:57,320
Yeah, man. Have you lost it?

1615
01:35:57,450 --> 01:35:59,520
You want me to watch as
Choocha poops?

1616
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:00,890
Spray this deodorant,

1617
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:02,640
but don't let him sleep.

1618
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:05,410
Hold your breath if you must.

1619
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:13,640
I might die if I don't breathe,
but I'll definitely die if I do.

1620
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:17,120
I should've let Bholi take my eyes
than live to see this day.

1621
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:18,320
Go.

1622
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:21,270
Hey.

1623
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,610
Guys, I saw something.

1624
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,280
Dude...

1625
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:27,240
I saw...

1626
01:36:27,370 --> 01:36:29,000
I saw Lali holding

1627
01:36:29,190 --> 01:36:31,420
the tiger cub in his arms

1628
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:34,200
and walking ahead of us
in the tiger cage.

1629
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,440
And then

1630
01:36:35,570 --> 01:36:37,520
we enter a tunnel...

1631
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:39,810
And then the same cave,

1632
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:41,320
and tiger...

1633
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:43,000
And then...

1634
01:36:43,570 --> 01:36:45,460
Then...
That's it.

1635
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:47,210
Did you really see it, or are
you again...

1636
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:49,440
I saw it, Zafar, I swear.

1637
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,640
Tiger cub?

1638
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:08,420
I sold it already.

1639
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:10,750
It must be on its way to
China by now.

1640
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,570
Madam, if Lali doesn't hold
the cub in his hands,

1641
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:14,200
the treasure will slip
out of our hands.

1642
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:15,620
If you want the treasure, we need the cub.

1643
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:17,720
Okay, I'll try and stop it.

1644
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:19,830
Call Chang, pay double.

1645
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,240
Ask him to return the tiger cub.

1646
01:37:21,490 --> 01:37:23,250
Bro, what did she say?

1647
01:37:23,670 --> 01:37:24,840
She's bringing it.

1648
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:33,850
May his soul rest in peace.

1649
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:35,920
May his soul rest in peace.

1650
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:37,840
May his soul rest in peace.

1651
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,080
May his soul rest in peace.

1652
01:37:40,210 --> 01:37:41,740
May his soul rest in peace.

1653
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:43,880
May his soul rest in peace.

1654
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:45,830
May his soul rest in peace.

1655
01:37:46,150 --> 01:37:47,480
Mr. Bhatia,

1656
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:49,080
I would've come to you...

1657
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,410
May his soul rest in peace.

1658
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:53,280
May his soul rest in peace.

1659
01:38:13,490 --> 01:38:14,600
Just answer my questions

1660
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:17,870
with a yes or no.

1661
01:38:31,850 --> 01:38:33,560
Did you meet the chief minister?

1662
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:54,000
Are those boys involved in this?

1663
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:42,040
Get the car ready. Come on. Hurry up.

1664
01:39:45,410 --> 01:39:47,110
I've lost millions

1665
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:49,350
because of you and
your four idiots, Bholi.

1666
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:52,950
On top of it all

1667
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:54,850
you took me for granted.

1668
01:39:54,980 --> 01:39:56,930
That hurts the most.

1669
01:39:57,680 --> 01:40:00,470
You know what I can do to you all.

1670
01:40:01,630 --> 01:40:02,840
Why, then?

1671
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:04,520
Why did you do this?

1672
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,760
Please give me a good reason.

1673
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:12,200
Can we...

1674
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:13,760
Can we talk in private?

1675
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:19,190
Can we talk in private?

1676
01:40:30,610 --> 01:40:32,040
Future.

1677
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:36,070
You've gone bonkers, Bholi.

1678
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:38,650
In politics

1679
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:41,230
there is place for thugs,
but not for fools.

1680
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:43,320
Forget your hopes for
an election ticket.

1681
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:45,240
Treasure.

1682
01:40:55,410 --> 01:40:57,540
Bholi, my dear...

1683
01:40:57,830 --> 01:40:59,720
What is wrong with you?

1684
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:05,690
How could you believe
those boys' idiotic stories?

1685
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:10,320
Belief makes the world
go around, Mr. Bhatia.

1686
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,860
If you believe in it,
then even trash can be a treasure.

1687
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:14,960
And If you don't,
even treasure is trash.

1688
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:28,330
And what if there is no treasure?

1689
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,760
Then shoot me for real.

1690
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:54,710
Hurry up, dude.

1691
01:41:55,970 --> 01:41:56,920
Pandit.

1692
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:58,120
Lali.

1693
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:02,150
We're preparing as if we're
going to look for lost treasure.

1694
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:04,480
We really are going to
look for treasure.

1695
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:37,390
Here...

1696
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,000
Here's your tiger cub.

1697
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:40,440
What's next?

1698
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:42,440
Tiger in Lali's lap...

1699
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,240
Lali, hold the cub in your arms.

1700
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:47,330
Take it, dude.

1701
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:06,080
Come here. Good boy.

1702
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:08,430
Come, come to Daddy.

1703
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:11,080
-Don't bite Daddy.
-Just hold it.

1704
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:14,050
Now we have the cub.
Where is the tunnel?

1705
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:16,900
Right here.
The tigress was digging here last night.

1706
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:20,200
Dude,

1707
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:24,120
promise me that you'll never
bring me in your dreams again.

1708
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,870
-Okay.
-Hold on.

1709
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,870
We also need two demons.

1710
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,270
Can there be demons
worse than the two of you?

1711
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,680
There are.
Changu and Mangu.

1712
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:36,570
Bro, if this tigress is involved
then they have to be the two demons.

1713
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:47,000
-But, madam...
-Shut up, or I'll pack you off to China.

1714
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:48,520
-Yes, ma'am...
-Come on.

1715
01:44:09,330 --> 01:44:10,360
You?

1716
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:11,650
How come you're here?

1717
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:13,400
The same reason you are.

1718
01:44:13,610 --> 01:44:14,840
What do you mean?

1719
01:44:15,070 --> 01:44:16,150
We're coming with you.

1720
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:17,600
-Neetu ma'am.
-Neetu...

1721
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:19,990
Baby.

1722
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:22,550
Neetu, are you mad?

1723
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:25,000
Zafar, are only madmen allowed there?

1724
01:44:25,210 --> 01:44:26,350
In that case just send him.

1725
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,990
Hey, this isn't some
underground party.

1726
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,430
There's a hungry tigress there.

1727
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,100
She'll eat us alive at the
first opportunity.

1728
01:44:32,230 --> 01:44:35,000
Tiger or dinosaur,
we're coming, and that's that.

1729
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:37,910
Have you ever considered
what happens to us?

1730
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:39,840
We barely had a year of peace

1731
01:44:39,970 --> 01:44:42,200
and then we were back to square one.

1732
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:44,270
Enough is enough.

1733
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,440
Either we're in this together,
or not at all.

1734
01:44:46,570 --> 01:44:48,990
Yes. Take us with you.

1735
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,310
Or end everything before you go.

1736
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:52,520
I'll be weaker if you're with us.

1737
01:44:52,830 --> 01:44:55,360
Go on, take the girls with us.

1738
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:58,270
-We could do with the extra hands.
-Yes.

1739
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:01,350
Eddie boy,
give the girls a pan and a spade.

1740
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:03,360
Madam, this is a personal matter...

1741
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:05,920
Let it be.

1742
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:15,400
Come.

1743
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:23,310
Neetu.

1744
01:46:06,690 --> 01:46:08,600
Come, Simran.

1745
01:46:09,130 --> 01:46:12,200
Come live your life.

1746
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:16,510
"Who are you waiting for?"

1747
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:18,680
"Here I am."

1748
01:46:34,030 --> 01:46:35,810
Don't add to the weight, man.

1749
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:41,740
Are you ready, young man?

1750
01:47:51,710 --> 01:47:52,800
Choocha.

1751
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,550
I may not have the chance to ask later.

1752
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:57,390
I was wondering

1753
01:47:57,810 --> 01:47:59,830
how you came into being.

1754
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:02,080
As in, how did you come
into this world?

1755
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:03,550
Pandit,

1756
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:05,880
even I asked my father once

1757
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:07,440
where I've come from.

1758
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:09,400
So he told me a story.

1759
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:10,480
Oh, really?

1760
01:48:10,610 --> 01:48:12,280
Your dad is a storyteller, too?

1761
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:13,920
He's an avid storyteller.

1762
01:48:14,050 --> 01:48:16,080
He's taken after me.

1763
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:18,430
But I don't understand
some of his stories.

1764
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,920
Tell me if you do.

1765
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:22,640
Here's the story.

1766
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,120
My father said

1767
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:28,030
that once like us,
he was passing through a jungle.

1768
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:29,680
There he saw me,

1769
01:48:29,930 --> 01:48:31,680
the lovable Choocha.

1770
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,880
I was stuck to a witch's stomach.

1771
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,910
The moment my father saw me

1772
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:37,400
he fell in love.

1773
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:40,350
He told the witch,
"Hey, witch.

1774
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:43,950
Give me this lovable Choocha,
who is stuck to your stomach."

1775
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:46,700
Stop there, new-age Homer.
What's this nonsense?

1776
01:48:46,830 --> 01:48:47,790
Are you out of your mind?

1777
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:50,220
Look, Bholi, I've told you before.

1778
01:48:50,350 --> 01:48:52,470
Don't interrupt me in the
middle of a story.

1779
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:53,640
I don't like it.

1780
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:59,160
So what was I telling you, Pandit?

1781
01:48:59,870 --> 01:49:02,320
-The witch's stomach...
-Yes.

1782
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:03,830
So the witch said,

1783
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,390
"I'll give you my lovable Choocha
on one condition.

1784
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,930
You must marry me first."

1785
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:11,270
My father thought about it

1786
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:13,430
but then married the witch,
just for me.

1787
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:17,040
Then he brought the witch and me
to A2/16, Geeta Colony.

1788
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:20,830
But I never understood one thing.

1789
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:24,030
Why does my mother start hitting me
with her sandals

1790
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:26,510
when I ask Dad about where the witch is?

1791
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:46,580
I must meet your father, dude.

1792
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:50,640
Could be difficult.

1793
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:52,550
He doesn't meet anybody
and everybody.

1794
01:49:58,980 --> 01:49:59,990
Shit.

1795
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:04,580
Flashlight.

1796
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:43,920
Dude,

1797
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:46,330
I saw something just like this.

1798
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:48,240
What is this place?

1799
01:50:48,730 --> 01:50:50,160
This is Delhi, madam.

1800
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:53,080
As above, so below.

1801
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:55,470
Like metro.

1802
01:50:57,090 --> 01:50:58,820
Hey, stop.

1803
01:50:59,390 --> 01:51:00,400
Don't let him run.

1804
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:02,680
You can't even hold on to a cub.

1805
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,030
-Come on, Lali...
-Catch him.

1806
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,600
Zafar, catch him.

1807
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,230
-This way.
-Catch him.

1808
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:16,800
Where did he go?

1809
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:18,900
Mummy!

1810
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:37,040
Hold on. Be still, be still. Don't run.

1811
01:52:01,210 --> 01:52:02,960
Hey there, little friend...

1812
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:05,270
Nice tigress.

1813
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:07,880
-Shut up.
-You're a good tigress. Please...

1814
01:52:08,050 --> 01:52:08,970
We'll feed you twenty chicken.

1815
01:52:15,650 --> 01:52:16,760
Zafar.

1816
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:17,740
-Hunny...
-Yes?

1817
01:52:17,870 --> 01:52:19,760
-There's a way out there.
-Where?

1818
01:52:19,890 --> 01:52:22,200
The tunnel to the left, there.

1819
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:26,940
Switch off your lights somehow.

1820
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:29,450
There's a better chance of
getting out in the darkness.

1821
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:32,800
Switch off, switch off, everyone.

1822
01:52:38,370 --> 01:52:40,030
Now let's leave one by one.

1823
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,920
Oh, no, no. No. No.

1824
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:43,770
No, not there.

1825
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:45,470
Choocha, you'll get us killed.

1826
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:46,600
Yes, yes.

1827
01:52:46,730 --> 01:52:47,910
A bit to the left.

1828
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:49,350
To the right now.

1829
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:51,520
Put the lights back on.

1830
01:52:51,650 --> 01:52:53,360
We're all good now.

1831
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:02,750
Scratch a bit under
the t-shirt...

1832
01:53:05,690 --> 01:53:07,800
Look, Life of Chu is on.

1833
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:11,670
This feels great.

1834
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:13,240
-Hunny.
-Yes?

1835
01:53:13,590 --> 01:53:16,140
Why is the tigress staring at you?

1836
01:53:17,550 --> 01:53:18,620
Down.

1837
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:22,150
God bless you.

1838
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:23,520
Zafar,

1839
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:25,540
she's not staring at me...

1840
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:29,260
Thank God your mother
doesn't cut your nails.

1841
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:35,080
Choocha... Choocha.

1842
01:53:35,970 --> 01:53:37,030
Pandit, is that your hand?

1843
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:39,870
No, Bholi. My hands are in my pockets.
That's Lali.

1844
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:42,640
This way.

1845
01:53:45,510 --> 01:53:46,880
That's enough.

1846
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:48,920
Thanks, dude.

1847
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:51,830
I've got to go now.

1848
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:54,560
Take care of your mom, okay?

1849
01:53:57,740 --> 01:53:59,750
This is what happens when
you eat her food.

1850
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:01,950
Now she's going to eat you.

1851
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:04,620
Bro, as you sow

1852
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:06,830
so shall you reap.

1853
01:54:15,270 --> 01:54:16,620
Is there a magic lamp there?

1854
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:19,020
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1855
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:20,500
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1856
01:54:20,630 --> 01:54:22,080
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1857
01:54:22,210 --> 01:54:23,540
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1858
01:54:23,670 --> 01:54:25,070
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1859
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:26,540
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"Slackers."

1860
01:54:26,670 --> 01:54:28,030
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1861
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:29,700
-This way.
-"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1862
01:54:29,830 --> 01:54:32,610
"The slackers are on the hunt,
like snakes chasing their prey."

1863
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:36,330
"Their lives are messed up,
but they're not giving up."

1864
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:41,600
"They've got big questions,
but no answers."

1865
01:54:41,730 --> 01:54:44,850
"They're always deep in trouble,
but they have no cure."

1866
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:48,030
"First, lottery and dreams,
and now "déjà chu"."

1867
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:51,760
"Who will pay for this mess?"

1868
01:54:53,870 --> 01:54:55,050
Priya...

1869
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:56,360
Are you okay?

1870
01:54:56,550 --> 01:54:58,160
-Hunny.
-No...

1871
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:00,050
-Never mind.
-Sure?

1872
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:02,840
I found it. I found the treasure room.

1873
01:55:03,010 --> 01:55:04,500
-Come on.
-"It's a game of snakes-and-ladders,"

1874
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:06,360
"there are such ups and downs."

1875
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:07,500
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1876
01:55:07,630 --> 01:55:09,080
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1877
01:55:09,210 --> 01:55:12,290
"Keep your eyes open,
and dodge the incoming bullets."

1878
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:15,200
Hey, you stopped a four run.

1879
01:55:22,690 --> 01:55:24,040
What did you get?

1880
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:26,270
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1881
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:27,830
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1882
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:29,340
"She's out of jail."

1883
01:55:29,470 --> 01:55:30,810
"She's like dynamite."

1884
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:32,420
"She's going to whip everyone in line."

1885
01:55:32,550 --> 01:55:33,900
"She's Bholi."

1886
01:55:34,030 --> 01:55:35,410
"The slackers are in trouble."

1887
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:36,950
"They've got nothing."

1888
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:38,470
"But she's going to make them pay."

1889
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:39,990
"She's Bholi."

1890
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:41,700
"They've been through Mughal forts"

1891
01:55:41,830 --> 01:55:43,220
"and several gutters."

1892
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:46,320
"But there's no sign of any treasure."

1893
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,530
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1894
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:55,040
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1895
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:56,570
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1896
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:58,040
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1897
01:55:58,170 --> 01:56:01,200
"It's a game of Ludo,
there are such ups and downs."

1898
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:02,610
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1899
01:56:02,770 --> 01:56:04,090
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1900
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:05,680
Found anything?

1901
01:56:08,190 --> 01:56:09,550
Did you take it from a bin?

1902
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:13,320
"It's a game of Ludo,
there are such ups and downs."

1903
01:56:13,450 --> 01:56:14,760
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1904
01:56:14,890 --> 01:56:16,410
"Loafers, wastrels, slacker!"

1905
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:23,830
Zafar, between the Animal Kingdom

1906
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:27,150
and the Mughal Empire,
we're stuck at Victoria's Secret.

1907
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:29,230
What next?

1908
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:33,760
Lali...

1909
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:56,180
Enjoying your picnic in
the netherworld, are you?

1910
01:56:57,440 --> 01:56:58,650
Where is the damn treasure?

1911
01:57:00,370 --> 01:57:02,280
Start counting down.

1912
01:57:02,410 --> 01:57:03,630
If you don't find the treasure,

1913
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,720
I'll bury all of you right here.

1914
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:09,320
Priya.

1915
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:10,440
Are you okay?

1916
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:12,910
Don't worry. We'll try and
get you some fresh air.

1917
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:16,110
That's why I asked you not to come.

1918
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:17,400
But you refused to listen.

1919
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:18,660
Everyone just does as they please.

1920
01:57:18,790 --> 01:57:21,060
One blackmails us with stares,
and the other with tears.

1921
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:23,340
And we're just stuck in between.

1922
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:27,790
Tiger, cave, snake,
demon, treasure...

1923
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:30,680
Life has turned into one of
Grimms' fairy tales.

1924
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:49,770
Hello, mayday.
Hello, mayday.

1925
01:57:50,050 --> 01:57:51,350
We've found the treasure.

1926
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:53,310
We've won the battle,
over and out.

1927
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:54,960
Mayday, mayday.

1928
01:59:27,570 --> 01:59:29,700
Idiot, is this your treasure?

1929
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:33,090
Couldn't you see these rusted locks?

1930
01:59:33,420 --> 01:59:35,630
Don't you know the difference
between a cave and a warehouse?

1931
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:37,610
Wow, madam.

1932
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:39,980
You can see the locks
in this warehouse,

1933
01:59:40,110 --> 01:59:41,370
but can you not see the treasure
hidden in it?

1934
01:59:41,790 --> 01:59:42,830
Treasure?

1935
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:45,780
These rolls of toilet paper,

1936
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:48,990
jet sprays, TVs, refrigerators...
You call this a treasure?

1937
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:50,970
I admit this is no
Mughal treasure.

1938
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:53,120
But these are all branded
and brand new.

1939
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:55,580
Altogether, these are worth
millions in the market.

1940
01:59:55,710 --> 01:59:57,890
So now you want me to go and sell
toilet rolls from door to door!

1941
01:59:58,190 --> 02:00:00,760
No, madam, that will take too long.

1942
02:00:06,210 --> 02:00:10,160
We need someone who can get us
the right price in the black market.

1943
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:28,400
Mr. Bhatia, you might as well
embrace Bholi now.

1944
02:00:28,530 --> 02:00:30,160
We found the treasure.

1945
02:00:32,250 --> 02:00:34,890
Even I was stunned and
speechless for a few minutes.

1946
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:37,480
Of course, how else would one react?

1947
02:00:37,610 --> 02:00:39,910
I had already made some
arrangements for you,

1948
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:42,760
but you've saved me some
time and expenses.

1949
02:00:42,890 --> 02:00:45,540
But you'll have to help a little bit.

1950
02:00:45,670 --> 02:00:46,920
Sure.

1951
02:00:47,050 --> 02:00:49,090
-I'll meet and tell you.
-No, not you.

1952
02:00:49,220 --> 02:00:51,820
You stay there, tell me where to come.

1953
02:00:51,950 --> 02:00:53,280
Where are you?

1954
02:00:54,170 --> 02:00:57,680
The abandoned rail yard near
Tughlaqabad fort.

1955
02:00:57,810 --> 02:00:59,120
We found the treasure here.

1956
02:01:25,860 --> 02:01:29,450
Instead of Mughal treasure
you've raided my own hidden cache!

1957
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:31,430
Move.

1958
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:32,940
And you guys...

1959
02:01:33,210 --> 02:01:35,890
You've got stuck to me
like leeches.

1960
02:01:36,130 --> 02:01:38,600
First, you won off my
lotteries for years,

1961
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:40,760
then you got the same
lottery dens shut down.

1962
02:01:40,890 --> 02:01:42,880
You made me pay the public
100 million rupees.

1963
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:43,970
And now...

1964
02:01:45,450 --> 02:01:49,160
You can't get to know Babulal Bhatia
in just one night.

1965
02:01:49,290 --> 02:01:50,440
Got that?

1966
02:01:50,570 --> 02:01:53,730
I've built this empire on the
graves of thousands like you.

1967
02:01:54,650 --> 02:01:58,290
I can make you disappear in a jiffy
and nobody will notice.

1968
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:02,730
Worthless vagabonds.

1969
02:02:03,210 --> 02:02:06,380
You think you can loot
my hard earned wealth?

1970
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:09,740
You'll never lay a hand on
any of this, get it?

1971
02:02:11,650 --> 02:02:13,880
And neither will you.

1972
02:02:17,690 --> 02:02:19,050
Mr. Bhatia.

1973
02:02:27,620 --> 02:02:30,440
This time, I have proof
and witnesses.

1974
02:02:30,650 --> 02:02:32,820
And the culprit has confessed
to the crime as well.

1975
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:35,080
Yes, sir. Had you come any later

1976
02:02:35,210 --> 02:02:37,810
you'd also have caught
a murder on camera.

1977
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:53,370
Idiot, is this your treasure?

1978
02:02:53,650 --> 02:02:56,570
Couldn't you see these rusted locks?

1979
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:59,370
Don't you know the difference
between a cave and a warehouse?

1980
02:03:00,050 --> 02:03:00,880
Wow, madam.

1981
02:03:01,010 --> 02:03:02,520
You can see the locks
in this warehouse,

1982
02:03:02,650 --> 02:03:03,880
but can you not see the treasure
hidden in it?

1983
02:03:04,010 --> 02:03:04,930
Treasure?

1984
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:07,560
These rolls of toilet paper,

1985
02:03:07,690 --> 02:03:10,740
jet sprays, TVs, refrigerators...
You call this a treasure?

1986
02:03:10,870 --> 02:03:12,800
I admit this is no
Mughal treasure.

1987
02:03:12,930 --> 02:03:14,720
But these are all branded
and brand new.

1988
02:03:14,850 --> 02:03:16,770
Altogether, these are worth
millions in the market.

1989
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:19,240
So now I'll go selling
toilet rolls from door to door?

1990
02:03:19,370 --> 02:03:22,010
No, madam, that will take too long.

1991
02:03:22,950 --> 02:03:26,730
We need someone who can get us
the right price in the black market.

1992
02:03:27,530 --> 02:03:28,970
89 dollars.

1993
02:03:29,530 --> 02:03:31,490
For toilet paper.

1994
02:03:32,170 --> 02:03:35,130
That's 6000 rupees for one roll.

1995
02:03:35,370 --> 02:03:36,570
Jet sprays

1996
02:03:37,050 --> 02:03:38,290
are for 400 dollars.

1997
02:03:38,930 --> 02:03:40,930
Pillows and mattresses

1998
02:03:41,930 --> 02:03:43,290
are for 1100 dollars.

1999
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:44,400
What?

2000
02:03:44,530 --> 02:03:46,400
This stuff is from the YAMA scam

2001
02:03:46,530 --> 02:03:49,930
which was bought at inflated prices
and was never sent to the right place.

2002
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:52,770
-You mean the games village scam?
-Yes.

2003
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:56,000
Youth Athletic Meet, Asia. March 2014.

2004
02:03:56,130 --> 02:03:58,440
-And perpetrator was none other than...
-Babulal Bhatia.

2005
02:03:58,570 --> 02:03:59,400
Here it is...

2006
02:03:59,530 --> 02:04:03,330
"Babulal Bhatia, Secretary,
Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs."

2007
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:05,400
"2014-2015."

2008
02:04:05,530 --> 02:04:07,720
Exactly. There was a case
but not enough proof.

2009
02:04:07,850 --> 02:04:10,180
That's when the CM removed
him from his position.

2010
02:04:11,590 --> 02:04:13,160
What are you thinking, Bholi?

2011
02:04:15,290 --> 02:04:17,380
I'm thinking of taking it
to the next level.

2012
02:04:19,630 --> 02:04:21,750
Let's try hand at politics.

2013
02:04:28,210 --> 02:04:30,380
And... our debt?

2014
02:04:35,190 --> 02:04:36,410
Forgiven.

2015
02:04:37,090 --> 02:04:38,570
-Forgiven?
-Really?

2016
02:04:40,530 --> 02:04:42,160
-That's it.
-Dude!

2017
02:04:42,290 --> 02:04:43,770
Choocha.

2018
02:04:43,900 --> 02:04:45,770
This is Bholi here.

2019
02:04:46,650 --> 02:04:48,740
I have good news for Brijmohan.

2020
02:04:54,310 --> 02:04:55,430
Come on.

2021
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:58,180
Catch him. Come on.

2022
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:00,150
Mr. Bhatia.

2023
02:05:03,330 --> 02:05:04,690
You were right.

2024
02:05:04,930 --> 02:05:09,370
In politics, there is scope for thugs,
but not for fools.

2025
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:11,890
In trying to pack me off

2026
02:05:12,170 --> 02:05:14,480
you've got yourself packed off.

2027
02:05:14,610 --> 02:05:16,120
One-way to jail.

2028
02:05:26,970 --> 02:05:29,370
How shameless! He was laughing.

2029
02:05:37,540 --> 02:05:38,810
Well done.

2030
02:05:41,890 --> 02:05:43,050
Sir.

2031
02:05:45,570 --> 02:05:49,220
Sir, what will the government
do with all this stuff?

2032
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:51,720
I mean, if you want

2033
02:05:51,850 --> 02:05:54,320
we could sell it all
at subsidized rates.

2034
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:57,510
That'll give us a job
and people will get goods at half price.

2035
02:06:00,230 --> 02:06:02,060
"We will welcome whoever comes."

2036
02:06:03,350 --> 02:06:04,790
"Whoever wants to leave may leave."

2037
02:06:06,030 --> 02:06:08,190
"Don't give us too much of attention."

2038
02:06:09,150 --> 02:06:11,270
"Don't teach us wisdom."

2039
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:15,280
Send me a proper proposal.

2040
02:06:15,410 --> 02:06:16,450
Okay?

2041
02:06:16,580 --> 02:06:19,230
"Check them out."

2042
02:06:29,900 --> 02:06:32,350
Uncle, you'll have to do
one more thing.

2043
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:34,150
-What?
-Give away the bride.

2044
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:37,970
Because Bholi's parents
aren't around anymore.

2045
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:39,240
Look.

2046
02:06:39,370 --> 02:06:41,520
We've already got a priest,
orchestra and a caterer.

2047
02:06:41,650 --> 02:06:43,090
Hunny will arrange the decorations.

2048
02:06:43,220 --> 02:06:45,640
You just go to the beauty parlor
and get ready like a bride.

2049
02:06:45,770 --> 02:06:47,920
I'll pick you up from there
on my horse

2050
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:51,130
and we'll go to Goya on the
same horse, from the wedding.

2051
02:06:53,970 --> 02:06:56,170
Sir, give me a moment.

2052
02:07:02,410 --> 02:07:03,920
He's going to get slapped again.

2053
02:07:34,790 --> 02:07:36,620
Let me turn eighteen first.

2054
02:07:37,290 --> 02:07:39,600
Then we'll get married, all right?

2055
02:08:03,890 --> 02:08:05,370
What was that?

2056
02:08:18,330 --> 02:08:19,730
Not this, a French kiss.

2057
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:22,620
"The slackers are here."

2058
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:25,500
"Everyone is talking about them."

2059
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:28,780
"Acting and business is in their blood."

2060
02:08:28,910 --> 02:08:31,700
"They're good at heart
but their choices are hi-fi."

2061
02:08:31,830 --> 02:08:34,130
"They are the Rambos of their street."

2062
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:36,940
"It doesn't matter
what people say to them."

2063
02:08:37,830 --> 02:08:39,910
"They continue to have fun."

2064
02:08:40,830 --> 02:08:43,150
"Just let them be."

2065
02:09:14,970 --> 02:09:17,970
"Let them soak themselves
in the surroundings."

2066
02:09:18,150 --> 02:09:21,440
"Come, come, check them out."

2067
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:27,690
"They are the slackers."

2068
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:50,950
"Everything went for a toss when he
pretended to walk as if he's single."

2069
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:54,320
"He keeps chasing girls."

2070
02:09:54,450 --> 02:09:57,830
"The neighbors are watching everything."

2071
02:09:57,960 --> 02:10:01,380
"They wonder why there are
no drums beating."

2072
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:05,080
"He's acting too smart"

2073
02:10:05,350 --> 02:10:08,530
"yet he couldn't befriend any girl."

2074
02:10:08,660 --> 02:10:12,050
"The girls cheat him"

2075
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:15,550
"calling him sweet."

2076
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:18,950
"They keep calling him sweet."

2077
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:22,250
"Everything went for a toss..."

2078
02:10:22,380 --> 02:10:25,720
"You look good when you dance."

2079
02:10:25,850 --> 02:10:29,010
"Everything went for a toss..."

2080
02:10:29,140 --> 02:10:32,850
"They wonder why there are
no drums beating."

2081
02:10:47,030 --> 02:10:50,700
"Take your steps slowly."

2082
02:10:50,830 --> 02:10:54,130
"Reveal all your secrets to me."

2083
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:57,630
"Take a look at my biceps.
You reside in my heart."

2084
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:00,900
"I've lost myself to you."

2085
02:11:01,140 --> 02:11:04,580
"She asks for my number."

2086
02:11:04,710 --> 02:11:07,950
"I see her in my dreams."

2087
02:11:08,080 --> 02:11:11,210
"Everything went for a toss..."

2088
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:14,710
"You look good when you dance."

2089
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:17,940
"Everything went for a toss..."

2090
02:11:18,070 --> 02:11:21,870
"They wonder why there are
no drums beating."

2091
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:32,060
"Beats the drums harder
and reduce the kicks."

2092
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:35,770
"Your moves are not up to the mark."

2093
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:39,320
"You won someone over."

2094
02:11:39,450 --> 02:11:42,830
"You won a village belle's heart."

2095
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:46,300
"I went to win someone over
but she won me over instead."

2096
02:11:46,430 --> 02:11:49,800
"I am her king and she is my queen."

2097
02:11:49,930 --> 02:11:53,270
"This poor girl"

2098
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:56,630
"doesn't know her lover is a
hopeless romantic."

2099
02:11:56,840 --> 02:12:00,050
"Everything went for a toss..."

2100
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:03,520
"You look good when you dance."

2101
02:12:03,740 --> 02:12:06,790
"Everything went for a toss..."

2102
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:10,660
"They wonder why there are
no drums beating."

2103
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:13,960
"Everything went for a toss..."

2104
02:12:14,090 --> 02:12:17,480
