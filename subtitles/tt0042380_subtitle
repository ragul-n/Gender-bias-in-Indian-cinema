2
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,120
'Raj Mahal',
such a splendid mansion.

3
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,550
l'll tell you the tales
of the people who stayed in it.

4
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,140
Shabbu Dada...

5
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,010
Raj Babu, my master!
You've come!

6
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,850
lt's good you came.

7
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,430
l had to come Dada.
Your telegram forced me to come.

8
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,250
Come inside. The dead body
has been there for 24 hours.

9
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,450
Rani is still waiting for you.

10
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,690
Have a look at your sister
for the last time.

11
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,720
Come on.

12
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,239
She's dead but
she still seems proud and alive.

13
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,049
The proud head and the raised
eyebrows are same as before.

14
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,540
The anger and ego she had when she
was alive, can be seen even now.

15
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,580
Anyway, now l have no complaints
with my dead sister.

16
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,840
But Shabbu Dada,
the people have not forgiven her.

17
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,790
Maybe that's the reason
no one has come to mourn her death.

18
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,750
No one has stepped in this house
in the last 25 years

19
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,570
And Rani also didn't feel the need
to socialize with anyone.

20
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,920
ln such a big house she used to
wander alone like a mad woman.

21
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:19,530
Till she died she said that only
she would rule her father's home.

22
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,620
Her rule was the reason
for the destruction of this house.

23
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,159
Anyway, now what's the use
of thinking about the past?

24
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,750
Go and make arrangements
for her last rites.

25
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,330
You've become silent.

26
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,479
The queen who ruled this house
has become silent forever.

27
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,880
The people will forget everything...

28
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,140
but they will never forget
our sorrowful tale.

29
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,650
Your childhood...

30
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,000
your anger...

31
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,200
and your ego.

32
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,700
l told you many times not to enter
my room without my permission!

33
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,080
l'm sorry. l'm an old woman.
l've become crazy.

34
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,810
We'll have to repair your brains!
What is it?

35
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,370
Child, the master has called you.

36
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,290
Don't call me child!
l'm not your daughter!

37
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,659
Stupid woman!

38
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,980
- What's happening?
- Move aside or the horse will jump.

39
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,380
Stupid! Dada,
even you're behaving like a child!

40
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,880
Come, father calls us!

41
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,740
- Did you call us? - Yes. Go in that
room with your brothers. l'm coming.

42
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,840
- Who is that girl?
- How should l know?

43
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,670
- She's so innocent.
- So what?

44
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,310
- She's so beautiful.
- So what?

45
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,680
My children...

46
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,990
l want to tell you, henceforth
in this house, with you all...

47
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,690
an orphan girl
will also be brought up.

48
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,620
- Orphan girl?
- ls this house an orphanage?

49
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,920
This house has prospered due to the
prayers of the orphans and poor.

50
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,900
ls her mother also dead
like our mother?

51
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,660
My son, this ill-fated girl's
father is also dead.

52
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,710
- The innocent girl is helpless.
- Poor thing.

53
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,590
Wait, l'll bring her in.

54
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,080
Come child.

55
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,230
Don't be afraid child.
From today, this is your home.

56
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,090
Meet your sister.
Her name is Shushila Rani...

57
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,270
but we call her Rani with love.
She rules this house.

58
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,390
- Greetings.
- Greetings!

59
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,440
His name is Kundan. He's younger
than Rani but he's very quiet.

60
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,000
Greetings.

61
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,810
And his name is Raj.
He's very naughty and smart.

62
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,390
- Greetings.
- Greetings to you.

63
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,590
Rani, lndra will sleep
in your room tonight.

64
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,190
ln my room? But why?

65
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,240
Because your room is next to mine
and l want to look after her.

66
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,890
Where will l sleep?

67
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,969
There are many rooms in this big
house. Take her to your room.

68
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,490
- l won't do that!
- Rani! lt's my order!

69
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,640
Send her to our room. We brothers
will sleep in some other...

70
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,930
No!
She'll sleep in the same room!

71
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,020
Come!

72
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,290
Go child. Take rest.

73
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,310
- The poor thing is hesitant.
- The poor thing is afraid.

74
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,979
Why are you walking in style?
Walk faster!

75
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,830
l permit you to sleep here
only for tonight!

76
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,610
But on the floor, not on the bed!
Understood?

77
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,250
Yes.

78
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,140
One more thing! The light
will not be on the whole night.

79
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,020
Child, now you play with Raj and
l'll prepare the breakfast. Okay?

80
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
Good girl.

81
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,650
- Flowers.
- Thank you.

82
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,450
- Did you get scared in the night?
- No.

83
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,710
- Did you get sleep?
- Yes.

84
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,319
- ls your name lndra or lndra Devi?
- lt's lndra.

85
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,650
Your name is very nice.

86
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,500
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

87
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,950
Daddy told us to keep you happy,
so l've brought this book.

88
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,470
You'll enjoy reading this book.

89
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,939
You both are very nice,
but l don't know how to read.

90
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,310
- l'll teach you. Do you know how
to play the piano? - A little bit.

91
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,840
Good, come.

92
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,180
You're not well and
you went out in the rain.

93
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,520
lt's okay, Shambhu.

94
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,880
Enough.

95
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,510
l heard the sound.
Why are you beating it so much?

96
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,220
l did it for them! The breakfast is
getting cold and they're playing!

97
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,740
Then go and call them.
Why get upset?

98
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,610
What a problem!

99
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,719
Are you all deaf or crippled?
Can't you hear the breakfast bell?

100
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,490
When did the bell ring?

101
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,310
One day you'll get thrashed badly!
Come on, daddy is waiting!

102
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,280
You also come. What are you
looking at? Come on!

103
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,280
You play the piano very well.
You'll have to teach Rani too.

104
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,660
No. l don't want to learn the piano.

105
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,930
Rani sister doesn't want to learn
anything except anger.

106
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,900
- Raj! You're very bad!
- Rani, you behave very badly!

107
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,680
Quiet, you miscreant!

108
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,790
- What is wrong with you both?
- Maniac!

109
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,630
Come back Rani!

110
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,949
l've observed that your behavior
is very irritating.

111
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,650
lf you nurse this ego and anger...

112
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,820
this happy home
will be destroyed one day.

113
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,560
You're telling me but
you didn't shout at him...

114
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,930
who made fun of me
in front of a stranger.

115
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,880
lndra is not a stranger in this house!
How dare you call her a stranger!

116
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,530
She is a stranger! She came and
snatched my room, my brothers...

117
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,080
and my happiness!
She's a stranger!

118
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,300
Quiet!
ls this the reward of my love?

119
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,210
Begone!

120
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,880
The family had to pay a
very heavy price for this slap.

121
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:06,050
The sick father's heart suffered
after slapping his dear daughter.

122
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,949
The doctor's treatment,
Raj and Kundan's tears...

123
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,589
orphan lndra's prayers and
all the efforts were made...

124
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,150
but the stubborn girl
wasn't affected...

125
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,640
and kept mourning and
nursing her insult.

126
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,450
When the angel
of goodwill died...

127
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,530
moments after his last rites...

128
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,580
she again became impatient
to impose her will.

129
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,589
Get out of here you witch!
Now you can't stay in this house!

130
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,210
Stop sister!

131
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,280
No! No one can stop me. Our father
died because of her! l'll thrash her!

132
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,640
- But we'll protect her.
- We'll save her, you can't hit her!

133
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,530
Move aside you rogue!

134
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,160
Wait!

135
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:17,360
Why are you fighting? Child, stop
being angry, this girl is innocent.

136
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,040
Shambu Dada!

137
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,250
Child, it's your duty
to obey your late father.

138
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,480
Master brought her in this house
to save her from this harsh world.

139
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,120
Child, the dead man's soul
will be restless.

140
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,140
Child, be a little peaceful.
Come.

141
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,320
One sock is black and
the other is white.

142
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,069
This pair is also the same.
The one who made them is foolish.

143
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,449
The one who is wearing them
is foolish.

144
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,140
The white pair is mine and
the black pair is yours.

145
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,069
ls that so? Okay.

146
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,470
The shoes are ready.

147
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,120
- Bring them soon, l'm in a hurry.
- ln a hurry? But why?

148
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,710
Where are you both going?
Won't you have food?

149
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,870
We'll have food after we return.
There's a drama at our college.

150
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,980
Drama?

151
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,260
Yes drama.
We'll be late, you stay awake.

152
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,620
Please see if lndra is ready.

153
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,190
l've been ready but you're not.
lt's 8 PM! Hurry up!

154
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,800
We are hurrying. ln this rush
my shoe lace broke. What a problem!

155
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,920
You tie your laces,
l'll take sister's permission.

156
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,030
Wait! Don't ask sister else we'll
not be able to see the drama today.

157
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,080
- But... - No buts. l'll handle it.
Dada, please take these clothes.

158
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,530
Brother Kundan, hurry up!

159
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,030
Where are they?
Won't they have dinner?

160
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,620
They've gone to college.
They'll return later and eat.

161
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,280
- College? At night?
- There's a drama at their college.

162
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,240
Drama?

163
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,050
You've come into my heart,
as its only wish

164
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,920
l thank you

165
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,490
Let's dance

166
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,659
Let's sing

167
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,580
You are the song and
l'm your melody

168
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,700
l'm the voice of your heart

169
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,620
l looked for you...

170
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,770
you looked for me...

171
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,330
sometimes in spring and
in autumn. But be cautious

172
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,920
You are my world and you desire me

173
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,540
l thank you

174
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,800
Let's dance

175
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,840
Let's sing

176
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,590
Please don't make my heart flutter

177
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,540
No one knows my love

178
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,190
Our talks...

179
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,400
and the heart's wishes...

180
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,010
l hope they're not heard by the people.
So be cautious

181
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,590
You're the only one in my heart,
and you'll always remain so

182
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,270
l thank you

183
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,510
Let's dance

184
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,540
Let's sing

185
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,180
Where is sister?

186
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,770
- Where is sister?
- She's sleeping.

187
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,949
- Did her temperature rise?
- Yes. 120 degrees.

188
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,470
120!
Now what will happen?

189
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,980
Don't worry.

190
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,540
There's no need to be scared.
Sister won't eat us.

191
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,140
Change clothes, eat food and sleep.
Tomorrow you'll see my wonder.

192
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,040
Turn on the light.

193
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,050
Ghost!

194
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,110
Ghost's brother, so you've come?

195
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,840
Sister...

196
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,000
Yes, your sister. l thought
you all went see the drama.

197
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,210
But now l know that
you were enacting the drama.

198
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:12,060
Yes sister. Brother was the prince
of Baghdad and l was the thief.

199
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,900
Quiet you rogue! Did this princess
sing and dance before everyone?

200
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:24,150
The audience was enthralled.
The curtain was dropped and raised.

201
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,810
lt was a charity show, so we thought
you wouldn't mind this good work.

202
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:40,470
You are wrong. This foolish girl
has marred our family's respect.

203
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,889
Henceforth, she won't go to college.

204
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,260
Okay. Even l and Kundan brother
have said goodbye to the college.

205
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,920
Come on.
Go to your room.

206
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,340
Stupid girl.

207
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,920
We both were saved
but poor lndra will suffer.

208
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,129
ls that so? Then this thief of Baghdad
will rescue his princess.

209
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,290
lf you live in a decent home,
learn to be decent!

210
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,070
l'm sorry sister,
please forgive me.

211
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,810
Forgive you? Stupid girl.

212
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,530
- Who is it?
- The thief of Baghdad.

213
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,980
Open the door.

214
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,480
- Are you unhurt?
- Yes.

215
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,040
- Did your neck break?
- No.

216
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,160
- You must have got 2 or 3 slaps.
- No. l was saved.

217
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,160
Saved?
Thank you, God.

218
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,130
What are you looking at?

219
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,470
l can see the moon of Baghdad
shining in lndia.

220
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,300
ls the moon different in Baghdad?

221
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,040
- Yes!
- How is that?

222
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,520
lt's just like you. The difference
is that it has a flaw...

223
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,590
and you're flawless.

224
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,940
- You're good at flattery.
- You're good at blushing.

225
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,520
Please go.
Sister is awake.

226
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,700
To make this sister sleep,
l'll have to bring a special medicine.

227
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,560
Go now.

228
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,090
ls she okay?
You took very long.

229
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,710
You don't know,
l reached just in time.

230
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,910
Rani's one hand was on lndra's neck
and the other hand had a stick!

231
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:02,150
- Stick? - Yes, stick!
l snatched it and made pieces of it!

232
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,040
Rani asked, who is that?

233
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,980
l said,
'l'm the thief of Baghdad'!

234
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:16,560
Rani got very angry and so did l!
l locked her in the bathroom.

235
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,740
Here are the keys.
Take, we'll see her in the morning.

236
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,910
- You both are still awake.
- Sister, we're not getting sleep.

237
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,840
Here is the tablet and
the water is there. Have it.

238
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,860
- What tablet is this? - lt's
a sleeping tablet. - For sleep?

239
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:40,030
This is necessary to
stop your nonsense. Take it!

240
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,100
Go!

241
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,000
Have it!

242
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,929
Stupid!

243
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:15,679
What's this nonsense?
You're disturbing the whole house!

244
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,030
Sister, today l've become a pilot.

245
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,139
Here's the plane.
Sit, l'll take you for a ride.

246
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,960
You're crazy!
You've become mad.

247
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,170
lf l do or don't do anything,
it's a problem.

248
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,110
lt's true, l'm a pilot.

249
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,510
This is my uniform and this is
my cap. This is how you salute.

250
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,280
Tomorrow is Sunday and
l've to go on duty on Monday.

251
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,090
You're ready so soon.
lt's not even 9 AM.

252
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,430
l've to get a photo taken.
l'm a pilot officer.

253
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,370
l'm not jobless like you.
Bye! Bye!

254
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,300
You've worn the uniform and are looking
good. But fix your brainsn too.

255
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,920
You must behave like an officer.

256
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,840
- Sister, you should wear this
uniform. - Again the same nonsense!

257
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:33,640
Here's the flag of peace! Don't say
anything today. Please bless me.

258
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,950
God bless you.

259
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,679
Stupid!

260
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,140
Thank you.

261
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,300
You look very good in this uniform.

262
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,050
lt's not easy to be a pilot officer.

263
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,320
But something is missing.

264
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,570
What? Missing?

265
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,810
Wait.

266
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,110
lt smells so nice. lt seems
the scent of your hair is in it.

267
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,820
- Go for your duty. - Let the duty
be. Now l can't go any further.

268
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,450
l'll make you go.

269
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,350
Oh my God!

270
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,730
- What was happening here?
- Nothing sister.

271
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:38,480
- l can see that you're misbehaving
these days. - Misbehaving?

272
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:43,920
Yes! l gave you this necklace to
put in the safe but you broke it!

273
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,380
- Necklace? Sister, l didn't break
your necklace. - You're lying!

274
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,679
You may not remember, this necklace
got stuck in your hair and broke.

275
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:58,990
Anyway, take it to Hirachand
Jewelers and get it repaired.

276
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,160
Very well.

277
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,740
- You! - Where are you going?
- To repair sister's necklace.

278
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,620
Sister is too much!
She sent you in the rain!

279
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,690
Your clothes are all wet!

280
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:42,260
When l left home it was sunny.
Then it rained and now it's sunny again.

281
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,760
What can l do?

282
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,170
This is the rainy season.
You can't say when it'll rain.

283
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,260
lf you fall sick, it'll be bad.
Come on, sit in the car.

284
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,070
What are you looking at?

285
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:13,900
- l'm seeing the drops of water
on your beautiful face. - So?

286
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,230
They look very nice.

287
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,450
- lf someone sees us?
- He'll be jealous.

288
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,070
- You're very naughty.
- Whatever, but l'm very lucky.

289
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:31,520
- Fate has given this nice chance.
lndra... - Yes?

290
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,590
- The rain has stopped.
- So?

291
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:41,490
My desires are soaring.
Come, l'll take you for a ride.

292
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,410
No. l've to get sister's
necklace repaired.

293
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,669
Till the jeweler repairs it,
l'll take you around. Okay?

294
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,750
Whoopee!

295
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,390
This rainy season and you and l

296
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,929
My heart is beating

297
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,500
You brought love along with you

298
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,600
You brought the Spring
into the garden

299
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:41,359
See the flowers are smiling and
the clouds are dancing with joy

300
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,130
There's no sorrow
when you're with me

301
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:16,990
My heart says let's go to a place
where there's Spring every day

302
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,840
You and l should be there
and a sweet music

303
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,450
Only our voices must echo there

304
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,260
And we'll sing together

305
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,509
l've filled all the colors...

306
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,100
but where can
l get that color...

307
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,470
with which nature has made
your beautiful face?

308
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,779
- l got scared.
- Scared? Looking at me?

309
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,540
lndra, why did you
get scared of me?

310
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,970
l wasn't scared of you.
l thought it was sister.

311
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:37,930
l know you live in this house
in the shadow of sister's fear.

312
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,089
But you must rid yourself of this fear.

313
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,070
- Yes. - Where did you go
to get wet in this rain?

314
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,460
l went to repair sister's necklace.

315
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,620
lf this necklace
is put on your neck, then?

316
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,670
What?

317
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,290
l don't think l'm worth it.

318
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,890
You're right.
Before your beauty...

319
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,160
these pearls have no value.

320
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,379
The college days were so good.

321
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,910
Now it feels like Rani sister
has clipped our wings.

322
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,859
Come, let's sit and relive
the memories of our childhood.

323
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:39,299
Your family supported me, educated
me and gave me every happiness.

324
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,680
With the mercy of your family,
l forgot that l'm an orphan.

325
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:51,760
ln this lovely mansion,
l do what l feel l like.

326
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:56,720
l've been waiting four hours
and you're sitting here.

327
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,830
Sister, the necklace is ready.

328
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,910
She got wet in the rain for it.
Thank her.

329
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:08,859
l must also thank her for spoiling
the sofa with her wet clothes!

330
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:13,650
Sister, you get upset
over everything.

331
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,210
Now l've grown up.
Please don't shout at me like this.

332
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,370
lf l hadn't cared for you,
you'd have been nowhere!

333
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,690
Go and change your clothes.

334
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,680
Stupid!

335
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,330
l don't know what happiness you get
in hurting her.

336
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:40,020
Quiet! l don't like you interfering
in the matters of the house.

337
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,120
Today l'm very happy!

338
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:05,590
l'm again with all my friends,
but there's one man missing.

339
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,330
Kundan brother, Rani sister,
why didn't Raj come?

340
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:16,060
Raj is crazy about flying planes.
Your friend is a pilot officer now.

341
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,410
He's gone on duty.

342
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,200
l've come after 10 years from
abroad and he's doing duty!

343
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,220
l'll call him right now!

344
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:40,399
ls this a man's voice or a woman's?
Aunt, who do you want?

345
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:47,080
- l want you.
- Me? Can l ask your name?

346
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:50,050
You want the name!
You're very stupid.

347
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,850
Be careful about what you say
else l'll tell the police.

348
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:58,220
Explain this to your wife, too,
who flirts on the phone.

349
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,160
l'll talk to my wife later.
First l'll ask you.

350
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,900
l returned after 10 years abroad
and you didn't come to meet me?

351
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,550
You're very bad!

352
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:14,920
Okay so it was Mr. Ramesh speaking
in a woman's voice.

353
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,500
Friend, did you go abroad to
become a barrister or...

354
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,340
Don't fool Raj,
we're waiting for you.

355
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,300
Mr. Barrister,
l'll be there definitely by 4 PM.

356
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,600
Kundan and Rani sister are here.
We'll have tea together. Okay?

357
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,600
Very well Mr. Barrister.
l heard that.

358
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,859
Kundan and Rani are there and
lndra is alone in the house.

359
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,470
Raj is coming.
You all must have tea before going.

360
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,020
Sir, l'm not lying.

361
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,490
The pain starts from here
and increases this way.

362
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,470
l feel l'll get a heart attack.

363
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,860
Do you want to go home?

364
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,590
l'll take some medicine and sleep.
l'll be fine by tomorrow.

365
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,720
You can go.

366
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:44,890
This atmosphere and this loneliness

367
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,770
Please come for a little while

368
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,640
This atmosphere and this loneliness

369
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:15,930
This is a good opportunity to meet

370
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:29,550
Please extinguish the fire in my heart

371
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,580
This is a good opportunity to meet

372
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:52,020
lt's true

373
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,669
With great difficulty...

374
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:07,549
today l'm playing
the music of my love

375
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,060
On this melody please come...

376
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,710
and sing a song

377
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,690
This atmosphere and this loneliness

378
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:55,350
lt's true

379
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,350
Everything is here...

380
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,940
except your love, my dear

381
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,669
This life is not forever

382
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,390
Please come and spend a
few happy moments with me

383
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,400
This atmosphere and this loneliness

384
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,560
You? When did you arrive?

385
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,220
Six hours ago.

386
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:58,220
Then you must be tired.
Should l massage your legs?

387
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,950
No. lf your wrist gets sprained,
l'll have to call a doctor.

388
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,340
Do you think l'm delicate?

389
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:10,070
No, l think you're Mr. lndia.

390
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:18,210
Your iron-like fingers will hurt
my soft flesh. l'm very delicate.

391
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,590
You talk very well. l think
you can't concentrate on your work.

392
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,770
How can l concentrate?
You're in my heart...

393
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,120
in my eyes and in my breaths.

394
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,870
Love must be like this.

395
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,410
But why did you
stain your face with ink?

396
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:47,230
So that my beautiful face is
protected from all evil eyes.

397
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,610
Let me take it as a kohl
and apply it in my eyes.

398
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:56,110
l'll apply it.

399
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:11,589
Raj is his own master.
He won't come now.

400
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,029
lt's 6 PM.
Friend, please call for the tea.

401
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:21,000
lndra, my heart aches
to be away from you.

402
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:29,330
l feel like sitting before you
day and night and worshiping you.

403
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:34,030
The day will begin
and the night falls.

404
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,680
Again the day will begin
and the night will fall.

405
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:47,140
The God of love
is dancing in your eyes.

406
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,620
Wait, l'll do something
to please him.

407
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,779
My lover looks so handsome.
Should l show you the mirror?

408
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:24,910
l don't need the mirror. l can see
my reflection in your glowing face.

409
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,399
Move away.

410
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,510
l moved away.

411
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:35,259
lndra, if you can look at my palm
and tell my fate...

412
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,730
then please tell me
what is written in my fate.

413
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,510
- A beautiful girl.
- No.

414
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,530
A bright moon.

415
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:54,410
A moon, whose light
has enlightened my life.

416
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:57,430
lf l'm the light, then what are you?

417
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,350
l'm the moth who is crazy
for this light.

418
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,160
- Sister!
- We're dead!

419
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:21,240
Oh my God!
l'm dead!

420
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,580
So you're here.

421
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:35,590
Sister, my stomach is paining.
l came here to have medicine.

422
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:42,420
Medicine? You look like a mad man.
Go and change your clothes.

423
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,630
Okay, but my stomach...

424
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,450
Wait. Come here.

425
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,940
- What?
- Come here!

426
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,220
Where did you learn
to act like a thug?

427
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:03,730
Stupid!

428
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:06,690
Go!

429
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,180
- lndra
- Yes?

430
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,279
What are you thinking?

431
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:48,780
You didn't comb your hair
or wear good clothes.

432
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:50,870
You look strange today.

433
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,899
No reason.

434
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:58,040
You're the pride of this house.
You must always dress nicely.

435
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,920
lf you need new clothes,
you can tell me.

436
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:07,850
l'm so lucky
that you care for me so much.

437
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,020
How can l tell you, how happy
l feel to do something for you.

438
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:17,850
Ramesh Babu.
Please come in. Are you fine?

439
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,290
Yes, Dada.

440
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,060
Where is that king of liars?

441
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,700
l was tired of waiting and
he didn't come to meet me!

442
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,110
- Who is this?
- Put on your specs and see.

443
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:35,710
lsn't she lndra?

444
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:40,240
- Yes. Greetings.
- Amazing! She's become so big.

445
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:45,100
- Do you have any problem?
- No l don't. l'm praising her.

446
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,350
Who are you praising Mr. Barrister?

447
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,990
You've worn a lovely suit.

448
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,820
Yes. This was stitched in Paris.

449
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:03,050
- From Paris? Great! - Go away.
l don't want to talk to you.

450
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,020
l feel you learned this anger also
in Paris. Let's embrace each other.

451
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,590
No, you're very bad.

452
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,279
Please agree.

453
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:21,790
Raj, what's this nonsense?

454
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:27,950
Nothing sister,
we met after a long time.

455
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,009
Meeting him is like
getting the world.

456
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,510
- Right friend?
- Yes friend.

457
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:38,580
He was dying to meet me.
This is called love.

458
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,890
- Right friend?
- Yes friend.

459
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:45,700
l'll tell you later how much
l've suffered in your absence.

460
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,710
- First tell me when is the party?
- Tomorrow.

461
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,200
l've come to give the invitation.
But you all have to come.

462
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:57,910
- lndra, please don't forget.
- Me?

463
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:04,080
No excuses will do. Sister,
you'll have to bring her along.

464
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,040
Very well. She'll definitely come.

465
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,990
- May l come in?
- Yes, you may.

466
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,049
Do you want to say something?

467
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,680
l want to say
the same thing as before.

468
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:45,080
Girls must be married.
You must think about your marriage.

469
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,020
l've answered your question before.

470
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,090
But today
l want to know your decision.

471
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:57,569
Before my late master,
l had taken the responsibility...

472
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:02,200
and before my death
l want to fulfill it.

473
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:07,400
You don't need to worry.
l know what's good for me.

474
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:14,560
Then why do you refuse marriage?
For how long will you be a spinster?

475
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,790
As long the rules
of your society don't change.

476
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:21,549
Child, it's impossible to
change the rules of the society.

477
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:26,230
Then think that my marriage
is also impossible.

478
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,680
May l know the reason
for this hatred?

479
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,210
lt's because the men of this
country take a woman as a slave...

480
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,030
and l don't want to be a slave
to my husband.

481
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,380
lt depends on one's thinking.

482
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:45,270
What you call slavery,
society calls the duty of a woman.

483
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:52,200
A woman who lives her life for her
husband is honored by society.

484
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,910
l don't want to be honored.
You may go now.

485
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:01,770
Very well. But please think again.
Just once more.

486
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,340
lt seems this pilot officer
is now in the army.

487
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,810
No, l've just tried to please
my love. l'm flattering her.

488
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,600
Why flatter her?

489
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:43,050
Because there's a party at Ramesh's
home and my stomach will ache again.

490
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:48,609
lt's again going to ache?
l understood.

491
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:50,920
You won't go to the party today.

492
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,750
- Sister!
- Sister?

493
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,770
A medicine to keep the temper cool.

494
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:01,279
ln any weather, young or old...

495
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,870
intelligent or foolish,
this medicine works like magic.

496
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:08,300
Sister, l got the medicine
l've been looking for.

497
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,340
Listen to this.

498
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:18,120
30 gms papaya, 30 gms almonds,
30 gms brinjals...

499
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,420
30 gms 'karela'.

500
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:25,780
lf you mix all this and massage
the head, the temper remains cool.

501
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:31,140
To cool your head l have another
medicine. Go to work.

502
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,590
- Today is Sunday.
- lt's Monday, not Sunday.

503
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:38,480
Monday? Then l must leave.

504
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,569
Wait. Today there's a party
at Ramesh's place.

505
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,299
l know that. Bye!

506
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:49,370
Stupid!

507
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:56,240
To curb Raj and lndra's growing love...

508
00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:00,390
l must take the advantage
of today's party.

509
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:04,109
Ramesh is a fashionable man.

510
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:10,570
lt's possible that lndra's beauty
and dressing will impress him.

511
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,720
lf l'm successful...

512
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:19,330
then my brother can be free
from the web of that stupid girl.

513
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:30,529
We have to be at Ramesh's house
at 4 PM and you're not dressed.

514
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,400
Sister, l won't go to the party.
l feel shy.

515
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,310
Shy? Don't forget that
l've promised Ramesh.

516
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:45,879
Take this sari and these ornaments.
You must dress well for the party.

517
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,980
lt's a matter of our respect.

518
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,230
- Sister...
- Dress immediately.

519
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,330
They came in my house.
lt's a blessing from God.

520
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:05,760
My house looks beautiful with
their presence. l welcome you.

521
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:12,510
Your house is beautiful but l can't
see any guests at your party.

522
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:17,160
Those who l cherish, have come.
l don't care if others come or not.

523
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:19,480
- Come mother.
- Greetings mother.

524
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:26,290
Raj Babu.
You've come early from work today.

525
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:32,140
Dada, my stomach is paining.
l've come to have the medicine.

526
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,400
Did you have the medicine?

527
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,890
Dada, l'm looking for the medicine.
l don't know where it is.

528
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:06,470
Rani has taken your medicine
along with her to Ramesh's place.

529
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,200
So is sister's stomach
going to ache?

530
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:15,440
l don't know but if you look at
lndra today, you'll be astonished.

531
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,899
- Really?
- l swear. - That's enough.

532
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26,440
What happened child?

533
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:32,700
Nothing.
The car's tire is punctured.

534
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:48,180
Great, my friend.
You made a fool of us.

535
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:52,810
You said, it'll be a great party.
Many things will happen.

536
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,399
You were boasting so much, but
there was nothing except a snake.

537
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,840
Our time got wasted.

538
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:03,430
lt's no use dancing before a blind
man. You won't understand art.

539
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:08,859
What was there to understand in it?
lf there was a good dance...

540
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,800
or a lovely song,
l would have seen it.

541
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,120
Then you can display your talent.
The piano is ready.

542
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:19,720
Your piano barely works.
How can sing?

543
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:26,150
Great. Friends, today Mr. Raj has
insulted my piano at the party.

544
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,650
ls there anyone here
who will play it?

545
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:32,470
- lndra will play it.
- What? No sister.

546
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,970
Please play it.
lt's a matter of my respect.

547
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:39,320
- Get up lndra. You must not refuse
at such occasions. - But...

548
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:44,700
No buts. You'll have to play
the piano and sing a song. Get up.

549
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:26,930
Oh flower please tell me,
who is your beloved?

550
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:34,420
Who is the one
who has taken your heart?

551
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:08,379
ln this gathering....

552
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:12,090
everyone has...

553
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:18,590
experienced love

554
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:42,080
They feel the pain of love
in their hearts

555
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,830
Who is the one
who has become yours forever?

556
01:05:53,610 --> 01:06:00,360
Who is the one
who has taken your heart?

557
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:03,310
Oh flower please tell me

558
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:19,560
The feelings of the heart...

559
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:26,080
couldn't be expressed

560
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:49,690
Why did the eyes feel
shy looking at someone?

561
01:06:54,030 --> 01:07:00,370
Express the feelings of your heart.
No one is a stranger here

562
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:07,250
Who is the one
who has taken your heart?

563
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,870
Oh flower please tell me

564
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,190
That was great!
We enjoyed it!

565
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:22,840
l have no words to praise her.
Her voice is as sweet as...

566
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:24,270
Sweet meat.

567
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:31,030
l never heard such a song in China
or Japan or France or England.

568
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:34,070
But you heard it only in lndia.
Right?

569
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:47,120
Today's party was memorable. l liked
lndra's song more than the dance.

570
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:48,919
Thank you.

571
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,490
You're saying this, sister? l'm surprised.

572
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,090
What is worthy, has to be praised.

573
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,550
What do you both think about Ramesh?

574
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:05,900
He's fair and is good natured.
He looks like a bear.

575
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,630
He sleeps during the day and
is awake at night. What else?

576
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:12,960
You're very stupid.
l want to know his qualities.

577
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:18,790
l did tell you his qualities.
But why do you want to know?

578
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:22,720
Because he's a good man
and he respects me.

579
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,170
Good men have good friends.

580
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:30,930
There's a lot of difference.
You could learn something from him.

581
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:35,029
Ramesh's mother is very nice.
You, too, must learn something from her.

582
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,590
- Stupid...!
- Help!

583
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:45,010
He's young but talks big!

584
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:58,710
Open the door.

585
01:08:59,979 --> 01:09:01,379
lndra, open the door.

586
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:03,470
No, l'm going to change clothes.

587
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:06,519
No, l want to see you
in that dress.

588
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,750
Please open the door soon.

589
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:21,610
You're very impatient.
You can't wait for a little while.

590
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,730
Who wouldn't be restless
after seeing the beauty of the moon?

591
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:34,050
- You show the glory of this world.
- You know how to flatter very well.

592
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:40,230
The flower thinks that
the bee hovers around it for honey.

593
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:46,510
But the flower
never asked the bee...

594
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:52,769
why it was so crazy for it?
You know what l felt in that party?

595
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:54,929
What did you feel?

596
01:09:55,530 --> 01:10:02,440
Your smile kindled my heart like a fire
and your look wounded my heart.

597
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:07,960
Very bad.
The poor heart suffered so much.

598
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:13,030
You keep piercing my heart
without any fear.

599
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,990
lt's my life and
it's my poor heart.

600
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:20,320
Why have you become
so poetic today?

601
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:25,040
l'm trying to melt
a heart of stone.

602
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:31,690
lndra, today l want to hear
what you've decided about my fate.

603
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,160
What do you think about me?

604
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:39,130
l just met you for the first time.
How can l decide now?

605
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:46,620
Let me be close to you so l can
know you, test you and then answer.

606
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:54,200
Okay. So in your opinion
l'm an animal of a new breed.

607
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:56,870
- Yes.
- Yes? Wait!

608
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:14,370
This love will shake
the foundation of this house.

609
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:17,160
l don't know what to do.

610
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:21,389
Today my buried desires
have come to the surface.

611
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,880
For how long can l hide this love
and please myself with your picture?

612
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:32,170
My heart is fluttering
with thoughts of someone.

613
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:36,820
Someone is slowly becoming
a part of my life.

614
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,010
You're still awake.
Don't you want to sleep?

615
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:47,030
Someone has taken away my sleep.
l want to ask you something.

616
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:52,900
- What? - So what if she's an orphan?
But l want to marry lndra.

617
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:56,830
l like the girl too,
but will they agree?

618
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:01,570
Raj and Kundan will be very happy
and you can make Rani sister agree.

619
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,210
- l'll try.
- But when?

620
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,599
When l get the chance.
Now you must sleep.

621
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,600
You sleep. l'll sleep later.

622
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:27,850
My heart...

623
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:35,190
l'm pleasing my heart
with your picture

624
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:42,290
My heart...

625
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:49,330
There's a moon in this house

626
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:58,480
There's a moon
shining in this house

627
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:02,030
My heart...

628
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:11,380
What wealth...

629
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:19,710
What more wealth can l ask
from my fate?

630
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:26,930
Love is the greatest blessing...

631
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:36,770
Love is the greatest blessing
l have ever received

632
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,640
My heart...

633
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:47,000
l'm pleasing my heart
with your picture

634
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,929
Oh my heart...

635
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:03,050
When you're in my thoughts...

636
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:11,690
When you're in my thoughts,
l have nothing to do with this world

637
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:20,230
ln your thoughts...

638
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:30,190
ln your thoughts
l've forsaken this world

639
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:36,620
l'm pleasing my heart
with your picture

640
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,310
l'm pleasing my heart

641
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:47,410
My heart...

642
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,630
Even after my death your love...

643
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:01,790
will always be with me

644
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:08,440
Your love...

645
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:19,990
l've taken the oath of your love

646
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:26,630
l'm pleasing my heart
with your picture

647
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:30,120
l'm pleasing my heart

648
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:37,190
My heart...

649
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:42,130
Now Ramesh loves lndra.

650
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:48,650
l only need to encourage Ramesh.

651
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:53,360
lt's my duty to save the respect
of my family.

652
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:58,910
But l'll have to do this with love,
not with force.

653
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:18,900
What's this?
The union of fire and water?

654
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:25,190
Where are you going?

655
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:30,030
We're going to the market
to buy some good saris for lndra.

656
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:37,840
Saris?

657
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,060
Surprising.

658
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:53,720
Good we met you.
We were going to your house.

659
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:56,910
And we, too, were coming to your
place after doing the shopping.

660
01:16:56,990 --> 01:17:01,080
- ls everything okay? - l wanted to
invite you for lndra's birthday.

661
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:04,290
Thank you.
We'll be very happy to come.

662
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:09,860
l hope lndra is protected from evil
eyes. She looks like a fairy today.

663
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:15,429
- l've come to select dresses for her.
- Let me help you. Come mother.

664
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:33,010
What's the matter?
Both brothers look very happy today.

665
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,790
Dada, you also dance.

666
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:42,940
The structure of this house
has changed.

667
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:50,030
The structure has changed?
But where?

668
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,110
How did it change?
l can't see a change in anything.

669
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:00,220
Your old eyes need specs.

670
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:06,640
Rani sister's behavior has changed.

671
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:12,000
lndra's fate has changed.

672
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:15,770
ls that so?

673
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,720
What's happening?

674
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:51,130
- What?
- What's this nonsense?

675
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:55,250
Not nonsense. We're praising you.

676
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:01,640
l heard you bought
very nice saris for lndra.

677
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,880
Yes. You'll be amazed to see them.

678
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:08,019
l was amazed to hear the news.
Now l just want to see their colors.

679
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:23,270
Be careful, they're expensive saris.
They may get damaged.

680
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,220
Don't worry, l'll clean my hands.

681
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:33,360
Oh no! l didn't expect this.

682
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:36,580
You bought such a pathetic sari
for the poor girl.

683
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:41,400
There's no lace, no glitter and
even the color is pale.

684
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,880
What? How is this possible?

685
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:48,190
Listen to me and take them back.

686
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:52,750
Give her a few old dresses
like the one she's wearing.

687
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:56,889
- They may have been switched.
- l'll believe you but my heart doesn't.

688
01:19:57,450 --> 01:20:02,290
They were definitely switched.
You're surprised and so were we.

689
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:05,700
Mother's sari has come here
and her saris are there.

690
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:10,080
- Here is your sari. - Show it
to Raj who was making fun of me.

691
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,960
You were making fun of her?

692
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:15,880
Please take mister.

693
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,260
Please give madam.

694
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:37,350
Tell me the truth.
How much did you spend?

695
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,300
Who are you to ask?

696
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:42,630
- Did you buy it on credit? Haven't
you paid the bill? - Stupid!

697
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:46,630
- This is a gift from me to lndra.
- Gift?

698
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,320
- Why gift?
- For lndra's birthday.

699
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:53,010
- Birthday?
- lndra's birthday.

700
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:55,920
Yes. lndra's birthday.

701
01:20:57,130 --> 01:21:00,870
The birthday is tomorrow
but the party is on Sunday.

702
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:03,570
Please bring your mother
to the party.

703
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,240
Definitely.
l wish such a birthday was every day.

704
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:09,750
Okay, l'll leave now.

705
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,680
Shambu Dada,
please take the saris.

706
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:23,570
Let's go.

707
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:36,429
How did she change so quickly?

708
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:40,799
We didn't know lndra's birthday was
being celebrated. lt's strange.

709
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,660
Dada, please give this book to lndra.

710
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:23,290
Okay.

711
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:38,220
- What is it? - Nothing. l'm going
to give this book to lndra.

712
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:40,670
Let me see what book it is.

713
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:50,910
Take it.

714
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:02,019
lndra, you're the queen of my dreams.

715
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:09,170
For 12 years l've hidden my love.
Your smile is my life...

716
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:11,940
and your tears are
like death to me.

717
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,940
l'm living in the hope
that you're only mine.

718
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:21,190
But today, Rani sister's changed
behavior is scaring me.

719
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:25,490
Before anyone can
take you away from me...

720
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:30,490
l'll put the band of love
on your hand, on your birthday.

721
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,660
l want your permission
to tell everyone about my love.

722
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:37,310
l hope that you'll agree with me.

723
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:40,429
That's all. Your admirer, Kundan.

724
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:21,140
There's love in my eyes

725
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,780
There's a song on my lips

726
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:31,910
l'm yours and you're my beloved.
lt's our victory

727
01:24:55,160 --> 01:25:02,639
My world is because of you.
l've been yours for many ages

728
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:18,740
My heart has your support

729
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:27,140
Only you are my beloved

730
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:39,339
l'm yours and you're my beloved.
lt's our victory

731
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:43,070
There's love in my eyes

732
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:46,700
There's a song on my lips

733
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:53,490
l'm yours and you're my beloved.
lt's our victory

734
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:13,720
My eyes dream of you

735
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:17,639
No one is mine except for you,
my beloved

736
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:34,370
Let's come together and break...

737
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:43,060
the rules of this world

738
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:54,870
l'm yours and you're my beloved.
lt's our victory

739
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:58,490
There's love in my eyes

740
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,049
There's a song on my lips

741
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:08,950
l'm yours and you're my beloved.
lt's our victory

742
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:24,750
Oh, it's you. Please come in.

743
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,570
- Wishing you a happy birthday.
- Thank you.

744
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,300
Last night l sent something for you.

745
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:35,340
Yes, l received it. After reading it
l didn't sleep the whole night.

746
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:42,179
- Really? - Yes. Believe me,
l'm very grateful to you.

747
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,720
l've brought a gift for you.

748
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:47,630
Bangles.

749
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:51,000
These bangles are a gift
for your birthday.

750
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:56,570
lt's a very nice gift.
How can l thank you?

751
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:01,610
No need for that. l would like
to put them in your hands.

752
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:06,620
lt's a honor for me.
Take, please put them.

753
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:08,380
Please sit.

754
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:28,440
My band of love is on your fair
hands. Now you're mine.

755
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:29,700
What's this?

756
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:34,240
My love which was hidden
for years has surfaced.

757
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:37,840
Please say just once
that you love me.

758
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:40,210
Love? What's wrong with you?

759
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:46,900
l've become crazy. But even
in this craziness l feel nice.

760
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:51,590
Only once, please put
your hand on my heart...

761
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,820
and assure my desires that
you're only mine.

762
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,230
No! l can't do that!

763
01:28:57,610 --> 01:29:00,679
Please don't refuse and
hurt my heart.

764
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:03,290
For 12 years l've been worshiping you.

765
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:06,570
But what you want,
belongs to someone else.

766
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:11,030
l want justice. l have more right
to you than Ramesh does.

767
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,310
Ramesh? No, it's Raj.

768
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:21,390
My younger brother?

769
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:26,180
Yes. We've loved each other
since childhood.

770
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:33,430
Brother, please fulfill my wish.
l want only to be Raj's wife.

771
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:40,560
You have changed my feelings.
l wish you and Raj all the best.

772
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:47,190
l bless you that your married life
will be happy forever.

773
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:53,570
Your blessing is like the blessing
of God. You really are an angel.

774
01:29:54,850 --> 01:30:00,670
l'm very sorry for loving you
without knowing your feelings.

775
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,340
lf possible, please forgive me.

776
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:06,450
Please don't say that.
l respect you.

777
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:10,240
- Can you give me a promise?
- Tell me.

778
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:15,850
Raj is immature. He may
misunderstand if he learns of this.

779
01:30:17,050 --> 01:30:18,460
l won't be able to face...

780
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:23,680
Believe me, as long as l live
l'll never tell about this to anyone.

781
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,120
May God fulfill all your wishes.

782
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:37,480
Heres Kundan...
And there's Raj...

783
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:41,030
This clever girl has made
both the brothers crazy for her.

784
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,520
The drum plays and everyone dances.

785
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:02,800
l've brought a gift to kindle
the flame of love.

786
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:06,810
Brother Kundan. Please forgive me.
l was dancing in my joy.

787
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:10,460
You know what will happen
in this house today? lndra's birthday.

788
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:13,940
And my gift is this
expensive necklace.

789
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:19,809
When she wears this necklace
and come down these stairs...

790
01:31:20,990 --> 01:31:25,679
my heart will say on every step,
l'm crazy for you...

791
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:30,670
my dear,
you're a wonder made by God.

792
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,760
And this wonder is
because l love her.

793
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:38,050
Yes love. l'm going to tell
sister about it today.

794
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:40,130
You'll have to speak on my behalf.

795
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:43,350
Definitely. l pray that
auspicious day comes very soon.

796
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:47,960
That auspicious day is here.
You wait. l'll offer this gift and return.

797
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,040
Good morning and greetings!

798
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,120
Happy birthday and
here is your gift.

799
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,809
- Please take this necklace.
- lt's great!

800
01:32:07,070 --> 01:32:10,080
lt's made of pearls gold, diamonds
and the brightness of the moon.

801
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:12,790
The jeweler has put all the beauty
of the earth and sky in this.

802
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:14,130
Great.

803
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:18,850
ln China, Japan, Russia, England
and in this entire world...

804
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,370
there's no piece of workmanship
like this and never will be!

805
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:23,590
Great.

806
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:26,950
When you wear it
you'll be happy like a bride.

807
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:28,710
Great!

808
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:31,660
Do you know anything else
except saying this? Come here.

809
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:36,599
Sit down.

810
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:46,850
My bride is a special wonder.

811
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:55,710
Her waist is thin
and her neck is slender.

812
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:01,170
lt feels as if the moon
is wearing a beautiful ornament.

813
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:07,310
- Did you see your beauty?
- My beauty is with you.

814
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:28,160
My heart is beating very fast

815
01:33:28,590 --> 01:33:31,760
My eyes are sparkling

816
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:45,900
Oh, my heart keep singing
and creates a magic

817
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:48,250
Be merry with happiness

818
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:54,610
Look into my eyes, take away
my heart and make me yours

819
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:17,790
My head is spinning.

820
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,580
- You're very bad.
- Spinning?

821
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:25,269
See, this spinning
of the head won't do!

822
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:30,480
The to-be wife of a pilot officer
must be strong-hearted. Understood?

823
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:35,720
Think that after our marriage
you're flying with me over Bombay.

824
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:41,510
The jet takes off and there it goes,
through the clouds...

825
01:34:41,690 --> 01:34:47,480
cutting the air and
the plane is flying at 15,000 feet!

826
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:51,620
Sometimes it's up, sometimes down,
sometimes here, sometimes there!

827
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:58,559
Stop the plane!
My head is spinning.

828
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:02,750
Again it's spinning. With your spinning,
l'm facing a problem.

829
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:07,380
- What problem?
- Sister's problem.

830
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,620
How will l talk to her
about our marriage?

831
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:15,320
All you need is courage.
Tell her what you feel.

832
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:18,179
Okay, l'll tell her that
you want to marry me.

833
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:22,420
- Oh no! Don't use my name!
- Why? Are you scared?

834
01:35:24,610 --> 01:35:27,219
You're scared of your sister, right?

835
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:31,240
That must be someone else.
l'll go right now and get her answer!

836
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,410
Hail sister and
hail her pure thoughts!

837
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:50,120
People get their wishes
by bathing in holy rivers...

838
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:52,790
but l get mine by seeing my
sister and being at her holy feet.

839
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:56,059
- Greetings sister.
- What's this drama?

840
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:01,690
Not drama sister. l swear,
everyone is praising your goodness.

841
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,600
You're having such a grand
celebration for lndra's birthday.

842
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:09,700
- Tell me what you mean.
- What l mean is that l and lndra...

843
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:15,570
l mean that l and lndra...
l mean, we've had a dream.

844
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:17,870
That dream will never come true.

845
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:23,500
l know very well about the drama
going on in this house.

846
01:36:23,890 --> 01:36:26,290
Drama?
That means you know everything.

847
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:31,070
Then l'll have to say clearly.
Sister, l want to marry lndra.

848
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:35,640
Quiet, you stupid man! Aren't you ashamed
to mention this nonsense to me?

849
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:40,460
Marriage isn't bad. You should
have been happy to hear this.

850
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,640
Both the brothers
have ruined my happiness!

851
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:48,620
The devious girl flirts
with both you and Kundan!

852
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:53,210
Enough! l didn't know that
hatred has made you so hard hearted.

853
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:56,760
You've always hated lndra but...

854
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,920
aren't you ashamed to blame
your saint-like brother?

855
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:03,830
Foolish boy. lf you want to see
the deed of your brother...

856
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:07,270
look at the bangles of love
that lndra is wearing.

857
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:09,210
Your thinking is so low.

858
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:12,219
You didn't mind the saris
given by Ramesh...

859
01:37:12,990 --> 01:37:15,889
but you're against the gift
given by brother Kundan?

860
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:21,060
Why not? For my two brothers and
the respect of this family...

861
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:26,090
l forfeited my life.
l've sacrificed everything and...

862
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,310
this is the way
you're repaying me?

863
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:31,880
Read this love letter...

864
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:35,920
which your saint-like brother
has written to his dream woman.

865
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:39,920
And if you don't believe this,
then ask that chaste woman...

866
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:42,610
who is spreading her web
in this house like a spider.

867
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:45,559
l'll definitely ask her.

868
01:37:47,110 --> 01:37:50,910
lf they both love each other,
l'll sacrifice my love!

869
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:19,929
lndra, tell me the truth.
What is your relation with Kundan?

870
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:29,660
Yes, Kundan! The one who's crazy
for you and for your beauty!

871
01:38:30,230 --> 01:38:33,480
Are you in your senses?
Go and find out the truth.

872
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:37,920
You're acting like a chameleon
and changing the subject!

873
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:43,140
Beautiful woman,
l know your deceit very well.

874
01:38:43,830 --> 01:38:45,630
You promised love to me
and to Kundan!

875
01:38:46,130 --> 01:38:49,730
Raj, your mind
has been poisoned against me.

876
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:52,700
And you're innocent?

877
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:56,620
Tell the truth.
Are these bangles a symbol of love?

878
01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:02,540
Don't make fun of a helpless woman.
You're insulting my love!

879
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:09,970
Your love is fake! Your love is
two faced! Answer my question!

880
01:39:10,590 --> 01:39:14,960
Your question is so absurd that
l feel it a sin to answer it!

881
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:18,440
Very well! Then l'll ask Kundan!

882
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:21,580
No! l won't let you go to Kundan!

883
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:27,269
Why? Because your deceit
will be revealed? l'll definitely go.

884
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:30,390
lf you want to go,
you'll have to go over my dead body!

885
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:34,890
l won't see Kundan being insulted!

886
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:37,780
You won't see Kundan being insulted?

887
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:42,080
Shameless! Cheat! Unfaithful!

888
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:43,790
Move aside!

889
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:51,710
- Kundan brother!
- Where are you going?

890
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:56,639
- He's just left for Pune.
- Pune! No he can't go to Pune!

891
01:40:55,290 --> 01:41:01,519
You loved me and went away from me

892
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:09,000
You didn't think or understand
and became upset

893
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:45,830
You repaid my sincerity with doubt

894
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:11,509
ln just a moment you changed

895
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:29,170
You loved me and went away from me

896
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:36,910
You didn't think or understand
and became upset

897
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:58,600
ln this world,
who can l call as my own...

898
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:24,000
when you have turned away from me?

899
01:43:27,690 --> 01:43:34,469
You have turned away from me

900
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:41,620
You loved me and went away from me

901
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:49,210
You didn't think or understand
and became upset

902
01:43:51,870 --> 01:43:53,820
Stop this nonsense and mourning!

903
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:57,360
Who is dead that you're crying?

904
01:43:58,450 --> 01:44:00,429
Your soul and my fate.

905
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:04,280
You're the one to kill them.
You!

906
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:08,040
Quiet you stupid girl!
You insulted me in my own house.

907
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:09,910
Apologize!

908
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:11,730
No!

909
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:18,820
For 12 years l kept quiet
and tolerated your atrocities!

910
01:44:19,530 --> 01:44:21,500
But your heart of stone
doesn't melt.

911
01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:24,370
There's a limit to patience.

912
01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:29,430
l asked you, l begged before you,
but you never felt pity!

913
01:44:30,330 --> 01:44:33,750
l kept my respect at your feet
but you insulted that too!

914
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:40,070
You even destroyed my life
and l kept quiet.

915
01:44:40,410 --> 01:44:42,750
Ungrateful woman, lower your eyes
when you speak to me!

916
01:44:43,330 --> 01:44:44,830
You've lived at my mercy.

917
01:44:45,430 --> 01:44:48,600
To break your ego, one day
life will hit you so badly...

918
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:52,960
that your head held high
in ego will be lowered!

919
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:56,750
Stupid girl!
l'll pull out your tongue!

920
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:59,340
You did all the harm
that you could do to me.

921
01:44:59,990 --> 01:45:03,309
Now l'm not afraid of you!
Now l won't be afraid of you!

922
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:06,670
How dare you!
Get out of this house!

923
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:10,920
l too have a right on this house
like you do. l won't go!

924
01:45:10,950 --> 01:45:13,160
You won't go?
We'll see about that!

925
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:17,740
- Child Rani, be a little patient.
- Throw this woman out of the house!

926
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:20,670
This witch is enticing
Raj and Kundan!

927
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:22,500
She's shaking the foundation
of this house!

928
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:26,280
l'll make everything okay.
Child, go to your room.

929
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:22,950
lll-fated lndra, these three gifts
are the cause of your destruction.

930
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:25,840
Give them back.

931
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:30,790
Give them back.

932
01:46:47,410 --> 01:46:48,710
Who is it?

933
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:15,040
- Who was it?
- l don't know.

934
01:47:19,010 --> 01:47:20,510
What's this bag doing here?

935
01:47:21,530 --> 01:47:25,730
- Saris? - These are the same
gifted saris. There's some problem.

936
01:47:31,690 --> 01:47:34,169
Who is that woman? lndra?

937
01:47:48,740 --> 01:47:51,690
You're in this condition? Where
are you going so late in the night?

938
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:53,590
What's the matter?

939
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:58,060
l'm asking you.

940
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:05,690
You're silent, with tears in your
eyes and your state is distressed!

941
01:48:06,650 --> 01:48:10,370
You're definitely in some distress.
Come home with me.

942
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:15,890
No! l won't let you go in this state!

943
01:48:28,370 --> 01:48:30,920
There's no need to inquire so much.

944
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:36,360
lndra came to this house of her own will
and has left on her own.

945
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:41,820
lf you like her,
you can marry her.

946
01:48:43,450 --> 01:48:46,160
l'll be happy to see you happy.

947
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:51,179
Thank you.
l was wondering what the matter was.

948
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:54,090
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

949
01:48:57,060 --> 01:49:01,250
l've brought gifts from Delhi...

950
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:04,910
oh my dear mother...!

951
01:49:24,730 --> 01:49:26,030
Let me see.

952
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:33,190
Raj met with an accident!

953
01:49:33,270 --> 01:49:38,180
Yes. He's been admitted to
Pune Civil Hospital. He's serious.

954
01:49:38,750 --> 01:49:39,950
He's serious!

955
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:46,920
Doctor, l'll be obliged if you let
me meet my brother for one minute.

956
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:51,150
The patient is very serious so
l can't permit you to meet him.

957
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:52,960
You'll have to wait.

958
01:49:53,730 --> 01:49:55,230
- l'll have to wait?
- Yes.

959
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:26,410
Why have you come here?

960
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:29,850
To see Raj.
l got the news of his accident.

961
01:50:30,410 --> 01:50:32,010
You're the cause of this accident.

962
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:34,850
lt's due to your arrogance and ego!

963
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:36,220
Stop this nonsense!

964
01:50:37,850 --> 01:50:42,760
Your control no longer works on me.
We brothers always respected you...

965
01:50:43,590 --> 01:50:47,460
obeyed you but you never lived
up to the duty of an older sister.

966
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,600
You felt pity for no one!

967
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:53,870
lt seems you want to rebel.
What wrong have l done?

968
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:58,420
You disobeyed your father's will.
You broke a poor woman's heart.

969
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:02,790
You turned brother against brother
but you weren't satisfied.

970
01:51:03,210 --> 01:51:05,110
Now you're here to sprinkle
salt on our wounds?

971
01:51:05,570 --> 01:51:08,349
You're defaming me before strangers.

972
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:10,420
l'm not used to hearing this!

973
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:12,040
Apologize before everyone!

974
01:51:12,370 --> 01:51:17,050
You're the one who should apologize
to me, Raj and that orphan girl!

975
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:20,730
Stupid man! You'll be punished
for this defiance!

976
01:51:24,030 --> 01:51:27,370
You can't go in!
l won't let you go near Raj!

977
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:30,030
Who are you to stop me?
He's my brother.

978
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:34,360
But you're a butcher, not a sister!
Go from here!

979
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:36,420
l said go!

980
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:40,169
l won't!
l won't go without meeting Raj!

981
01:51:40,650 --> 01:51:42,049
This is my decision!

982
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:43,520
Listen to my decision!

983
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:46,580
l'll not even let your
shadow fall on Raj!

984
01:51:47,610 --> 01:51:49,509
We brothers want nothing
to do with you!

985
01:51:50,170 --> 01:51:51,270
Really?

986
01:51:51,290 --> 01:51:55,190
Yes! Know that Raj and Kundan
are dead for you!

987
01:51:55,680 --> 01:52:00,370
Very well. You also think that
l'm dead for both of you!

988
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:03,840
Henceforth the doors of that house
are closed to you both!

989
01:52:40,290 --> 01:52:45,060
Your name is on my lips...

990
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:48,780
and thoughts of you
are in my heart

991
01:52:50,610 --> 01:53:00,460
My beloved, please come back.
My life is in turmoil

992
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:57,420
The outcome of love was what
it was going to be

993
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:02,590
The moon of my wishes...

994
01:54:03,090 --> 01:54:08,060
is hidden among the dark clouds

995
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:15,680
Now there's only darkness...

996
01:54:15,970 --> 01:54:19,230
on my love

997
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:31,000
My beloved, please come back.
My life is in turmoil

998
01:54:49,470 --> 01:54:52,180
lt remained...

999
01:54:54,370 --> 01:54:58,309
as a plea...

1000
01:55:02,530 --> 01:55:07,320
that tale of love

1001
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:17,410
l'm here with your sorrow
in my heart

1002
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:22,740
Yes l'm here

1003
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:33,880
My dear,
l don't know where you are

1004
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:45,630
My beloved, please come back.
My life is in turmoil

1005
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:10,830
- Sister, how is Raj?
- He is dead!

1006
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:12,260
Raj is dead!

1007
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:14,920
All of you go!
l don't need anyone's sympathy!

1008
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:20,870
Shambu, ask them to go and close
the door! l won't meet anyone!

1009
01:56:46,610 --> 01:56:49,440
What's the matter?
You look disturbed.

1010
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:53,830
Don't ask mother.
l have very bad news.

1011
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:56,620
Bad news?
How is Raj now?

1012
01:56:59,030 --> 01:57:02,509
- Raj is dead.
- Raj died! What are you saying?

1013
01:57:03,670 --> 01:57:05,070
l'm telling the truth.

1014
01:57:05,910 --> 01:57:09,570
He died because of Rani's arrogance.

1015
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:10,920
What arrogance?

1016
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:17,590
Ma, Raj and lndra loved each other
but Rani didn't like this.

1017
01:57:17,890 --> 01:57:19,490
Raj and lndra loved each other?

1018
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:51,970
Lie down. You need rest.

1019
01:57:52,790 --> 01:57:58,210
l'll get rest only when
l see you and lndra happy.

1020
01:57:58,930 --> 01:58:01,830
lndra doesn't love me,
she loves you.

1021
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:08,560
Even l thought the same,
but your letter...

1022
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:14,390
l did write that letter to lndra
and it was my biggest mistake.

1023
01:58:15,290 --> 01:58:19,830
l didn't know how much
you both loved each other.

1024
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:24,160
She's yours and
wants to live only for you.

1025
01:58:24,670 --> 01:58:27,360
But the misunderstandings that arose
because you went away...

1026
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:31,560
how will they be resolved?

1027
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:34,990
lndra's misunderstanding l cleared
before leaving home.

1028
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:38,040
l want to assure you too.

1029
01:58:39,330 --> 01:58:43,530
God knows that l have
only pure feelings for lndra.

1030
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:46,480
Then why did you leave home?

1031
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:53,839
l left home because Rani had tried
to humiliate me before you.

1032
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:57,510
And for me it's better to die
than to live a life of humiliation.

1033
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:59,960
Rani is our enemy,
not our sister.

1034
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:03,900
You'll have to come home with me.

1035
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:07,070
No Raj.
Now l'll never go in that house.

1036
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:12,250
l tell you too,
if you want to be happy...

1037
01:59:13,010 --> 01:59:15,500
take lndra and go somewhere far.

1038
01:59:16,550 --> 01:59:19,220
So far away where Rani's despotism
can't reach.

1039
01:59:20,310 --> 01:59:22,890
Where two people in love
won't be tortured.

1040
01:59:24,990 --> 01:59:26,730
Let Rani live in that house alone.

1041
01:59:28,010 --> 01:59:32,200
She's blind in her ego.
Despotism has driven her crazy.

1042
01:59:33,260 --> 01:59:38,450
One day that house will haunt her
and she'll roam in it like a loony.

1043
01:59:41,430 --> 01:59:44,470
Time is up.
The patient needs rest now.

1044
01:59:57,890 --> 02:00:03,550
Don't be sad my child. God will
soon make you well. Be patient.

1045
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:11,840
Now what will l do by living?
There's no one in this world for me.

1046
02:00:12,270 --> 02:00:15,120
We are yours.
Don't treat us as strangers.

1047
02:00:15,710 --> 02:00:19,580
To see you happy,
we'll do everything.

1048
02:00:20,110 --> 02:00:25,360
An orphan girl whose fate
has gone against her...

1049
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:29,599
can't live as a burden.

1050
02:00:30,670 --> 02:00:36,860
You're not a burden but our joy.
l'll give you every happiness.

1051
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:39,760
l'm thinking one thing...

1052
02:00:41,810 --> 02:00:43,590
and you're thinking something else.

1053
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:47,370
Your betterment is in
what l'm thinking for you.

1054
02:00:47,980 --> 02:00:51,280
We have to bow before God's will.

1055
02:00:53,190 --> 02:00:55,110
Take, have this medicine.

1056
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:12,080
What are you thinking?

1057
02:01:13,950 --> 02:01:18,760
l'm wondering if the broken heart
will be able to live.

1058
02:01:18,950 --> 02:01:22,240
You're ignorant.
Time heals all wounds.

1059
02:01:22,690 --> 02:01:26,639
But lndra is hurt badly.
She might not recover.

1060
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:30,730
l'll make her all right. l have
the medicine to cure your lndra.

1061
02:01:31,210 --> 02:01:33,810
My lndra?
What are you saying?

1062
02:01:33,830 --> 02:01:38,970
l'm saying your wish. God has
given you the lndra you loved.

1063
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:43,320
You're taking advantage of a
helpless girl. lndra belongs to Raj!

1064
02:01:43,980 --> 02:01:47,879
Raj is dead and l want to save her
from this world!

1065
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:50,260
She can't live here as a spinster!

1066
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:56,190
lf people defame her, even our
family's respect will be marred!

1067
02:01:56,680 --> 02:01:58,510
People will malign us!

1068
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:01,219
So you want to poison her life
because of this society?

1069
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:05,620
One day this poison will bring
peace in her disturbed life.

1070
02:02:06,030 --> 02:02:09,690
Don't be in a hurry. Don't decide
without knowing lndra's will.

1071
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:14,690
This decision is for her good.
You and l also wanted this.

1072
02:02:15,150 --> 02:02:18,920
lndra needs support
to live her life.

1073
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:21,599
Bring this medicine soon.

1074
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:33,360
Raj Babu!

1075
02:02:34,770 --> 02:02:35,970
You're alive?

1076
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:40,179
Yes Dada, l'm alive.
Fate has given me another chance.

1077
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:43,890
But how did the news
of your death spread?

1078
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:49,599
There must a purpose behind it.
Whatever Rani sister does, is less!

1079
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:51,880
Where is Kundan?

1080
02:02:53,070 --> 02:02:57,750
This house is alien for Kundan.
l, too, will take lndra and leave!

1081
02:02:59,230 --> 02:03:01,940
- Where is lndra?
- She doesn't live in this house!

1082
02:03:03,310 --> 02:03:05,460
- Look for her at some other place!
- Sister!

1083
02:03:07,430 --> 02:03:10,180
Where did lndra go?
For God's sake please tell me!

1084
02:03:10,530 --> 02:03:14,540
Do you brothers think that
l'm a servant? What do you think?

1085
02:03:14,690 --> 02:03:16,389
l told you she doesn't live here!

1086
02:03:16,830 --> 02:03:19,330
Very well. l'll search for her.

1087
02:03:24,650 --> 02:03:28,389
lt won't be good if you bring that
wretched woman into this house again!

1088
02:03:29,190 --> 02:03:34,620
Why? Because you rule this house?
Because you hate her?

1089
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:39,120
Because you've hoarded
the wealth of our ancestors!

1090
02:03:39,710 --> 02:03:42,850
lt's because she has made you
a rebel and an ill-behaved man.

1091
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:47,080
lt's because this house was
destroyed when she came here.

1092
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:50,490
lt's because she took my brothers
away from me!

1093
02:03:51,130 --> 02:03:52,990
lt's because she's
wretched and wicked!

1094
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:58,250
Brother was right.
She's not wicked but you are!

1095
02:03:58,740 --> 02:04:00,139
Quiet you stupid man!

1096
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:06,290
l was quiet for 25 years
but today l'll break your ego!

1097
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:10,000
You're the one that caused
the destruction of this house.

1098
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:13,720
You're the one who tried to create
a misunderstanding among brothers!

1099
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:16,760
You're the one who tortured
an orphan girl!

1100
02:04:17,470 --> 02:04:19,770
You're the one who was responsible
for her father's death!

1101
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:21,570
Stop this nonsense!

1102
02:04:21,810 --> 02:04:24,910
This pride, this arrogance,
this egotism...

1103
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:28,930
this lofty head, these raised eyebrows
will lower you one day!

1104
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:34,210
One day this house will haunt you
and you'll roam like a crazy woman!

1105
02:04:34,470 --> 02:04:36,840
You'll scream but no one will
come to your aid!

1106
02:04:37,540 --> 02:04:40,030
You'll suffer,
but no one will pity you!

1107
02:04:40,670 --> 02:04:44,960
Even when you die no one will come
to mourn your death!

1108
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:48,920
As long as you're alive,
l'll never set foot in this house!

1109
02:04:51,340 --> 02:04:52,990
Raj Babu! Son!

1110
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:09,309
What an ill-fated woman you are.

1111
02:05:10,580 --> 02:05:14,720
The house that you step in
gets destroyed.

1112
02:05:15,670 --> 02:05:19,640
Maybe there are storms and
obstacles hidden in your life.

1113
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:23,049
What else do you want to see now?

1114
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:34,660
Hey mister, are you blind?

1115
02:05:35,310 --> 02:05:36,920
- Forgive me brother.
- Who?

1116
02:05:39,310 --> 02:05:40,410
Raj!

1117
02:05:41,420 --> 02:05:44,210
You don't need to worry.
l'm still alive.

1118
02:05:44,680 --> 02:05:47,710
Then why don't you embrace me?
What are you looking at?

1119
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:50,019
Can you tell me where lndra is?

1120
02:05:50,780 --> 02:05:54,210
Definitely not!
Not until you embrace me.

1121
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:18,759
You're sitting all alone?

1122
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:24,230
You look better today.

1123
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:30,630
You're sighing. Maybe it's because
of weakness, don't worry.

1124
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:35,460
Today l've brought such a doctor
who will give you a new life...

1125
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:39,009
new happiness and love.

1126
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,200
Look here.

1127
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:44,170
Look here.
Look at me.

1128
02:06:45,350 --> 02:06:47,130
You won't look?
Very well.

1129
02:06:47,930 --> 02:06:49,630
Then the doctor
himself will treat you.

1130
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:52,060
Doctor!

1131
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:06,730
The one who hurt you has come
to ask for forgiveness.

1132
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,500
lf possible, please forgive me.

1133
02:07:12,020 --> 02:07:13,420
lf you can't forgive...

1134
02:07:13,470 --> 02:07:15,530
give me a punishment
l'll remember all my life.

1135
02:07:17,340 --> 02:07:18,640
l misunderstood you.

1136
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:23,810
For God's sake please forgive me!
What's this?

1137
02:07:24,890 --> 02:07:28,020
Wake up lndra!

1138
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:29,570
Ramesh!

1139
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:31,820
lndra!

1140
02:07:33,740 --> 02:07:37,280
- Poison! - Poison?
No! lndra can't have poison!

1141
02:07:37,730 --> 02:07:39,730
l won't let you go away
from me like this!

1142
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:45,000
lndra!

1143
02:07:45,300 --> 02:07:49,080
Oh ill-fate! The desires of the
heart couldn't be fulfilled!

1144
02:07:49,970 --> 02:07:53,550
When the beloved came in the arms,
so did the death.

1145
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:58,030
Raj's tale of love was over.

1146
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,000
